<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the newly elected Pope Francis, featuring the hosts (Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton), and guest Sam Roberts.  The initial segment was marked by crude jokes, particularly targeting elderly women, and technical difficulties with a computer.  They heavily mocked Mike Francesa's flubbed live announcement of the Pope's election, playing audio clips and dissecting his pronunciation struggles.  The conversation branched out to include the Pope's age and health (mentioned lung issue), speculation on his lifestyle, the sheer number of Catholics globally, and a comedic exploration of Catholic Church attire, specifically hats.  Religious leadership structures in various faiths were also compared, seguing into a humorous tangent about the TV show "The Flying Nun," its premise, and Sally Field's pregnancy during filming.  They also discussed the show's prior actress, Ronnie Troop, and her later career.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a recent police shooting of a 16-year-old in Brooklyn, with the hosts criticizing the subsequent riots and protests, arguing the teenager's gang affiliation and justifying the police action.  They criticized the lack of focus on black-on-black crime and perceived hypocrisy in the protests. This led to a discussion about the George Zimmerman trial and a prediction of his acquittal. The tone lightened with Opie discussing his Twitter interaction with Fandango, followed by a comparison of his experiences on Joe Rogan's and Jay Moore's podcasts, touching upon a "podcast war" with Moore, his past marijuana use, and his alcohol preference.  Opie concluded this segment with a personal reflection on his past marriage, detailing frequent late-night arguments and his reluctance to end the failing relationship, highlighting how his radio career served as a distraction.

Anthony Cumia then shared his experiences with his divorce and financial difficulties due to his ex-wife's spending habits, detailing her extravagant lifestyle and the significant divorce settlement despite a supposedly invalidated prenuptial agreement.  Listeners called in with alleged sightings of his ex-wife selling hot dogs.  The discussion transitioned to a viral video of Louis C.K. handling a heckler, prompting a comparison to Cumia's own experiences.  A blonde woman seen outside the studio, possibly the heckler from the Louis C.K. video (later suggested to be a scat film actress), was discussed.  A caller launched into a highly offensive rant, met with equally offensive retorts from the hosts.  The segment also included discussion of Jim Norton's upcoming stand-up shows, a fake Pepsi commercial featuring Jeff Gordon, speculation on viral videos, the decline of cities like Detroit, and related political issues. A listener corrected information about Jim Norton's show dates.  The segment ended with a Pope-themed song, a discussion of "Rhoda," and a comparison to Marge Simpson's voice, including a played clip from "The Beverly Hillbillies" featuring Alan Reed's voice.

The next segment opened with a discussion of Yardley Smith (Lisa Simpson's voice), *Herman's Head*, and *Maximum Overdrive*, leading to an identification game of *Herman's Head* actors and a lengthy, humorous debate about the duration of Bill Murray's time loop in *Groundhog Day*.  A listener's video of his climb to the top of the Chrysler Building was showcased, provoking reactions ranging from amusement to horror.  The listener, Moses Gates, was mentioned as a future guest to discuss his book, *Hidden Cities*. The segment concluded with discussion of the video, a sexual product advertisement, and mentions of upcoming guests, including Fandango and CM Punk.

The final segment addressed phone screening techniques, focusing on a screener named Sal.  Callers offered "What Did You Learn?" segments, including a claim about Stephen Lynch's parents.  The hosts then spoke with stand-up comedians Moshe Kasher and Natasha Leggero, promoting their Caroline's shows.  The conversation covered the new Pope (age, health, rumors of a Vatican gay bathhouse, and a potential black Pope), Scientology (personality tests, the "Freewinds" cruise, and celebrity Scientologists), and St. Patrick's Day celebrations in NYC.  DJ Who Kid joined, contributing to the offensive language prevalent throughout the segment.  The show concluded with a Dollar Shave Club advertisement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6am and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fledgling.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to talk.  Like rotten egg from Sirius XM.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point Simery, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make the fucking second?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gun, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What happened?  What do you mean, what happened?  My computer just decided to restart again. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, oops.  It just went like, hey, how you doing?  Oops.  I'm restarting.  Well, we got a new Pope.  Good morning, everyone.  Hey, Pope.  Not a big organized religious guy.  But, man, that was kind of exciting to watch.  Did anyone else watch it all go down?  When the white smoke appeared?  I did not.  Man, you missed something that only happens every once in a while.  I'll catch the next one.  Yeah.  That could be another eight years.  What?  You know what'll happen again soon? 
[00:02:30]  The guy's 76 years old.  76 years old.  And what's he got, one lung?  Really?  I heard.  One lung.  Yeah, one lung.  The Pope has one lung.  Yeah.  Why does he have the one lung?  Something must have happened to it, man.  If he's doing God's work, why did God go, you know what?  It's not good enough you're doing God's work.  I gotta take one of your lungs.  The word of God, as a teen, he had a lung removed.  It was an infection.  So you can live with one lung.  That's pretty good to know.  Damn. 
[00:03:00]  76, and he's got the one lung, and he looked all right.  That's like being on a 767, though, and having one engine go down.  Kind of like, yeah, we can fly, but...  That's why I'm hoping no one in my family ever needs a kidney.  You don't want to smoke.  I don't want to walk around with the one kidney.  That's scary.  No.  And someone punches you on that side, and then that kidney's all fucked up.  And you go, well, fuck, man.  I had the other kidney.  It was fine and dandy.  I would have went right to the other kidney.  Now I can't.  I'm not a spare parts store.  No, I don't want to be a spare parts guy. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, Sam Roberts.  Morning, Sam Roberts.  Morning, everybody.  Oh, boy.  A little late.  A little late to the party here, aren't you?  You got stuff.  Ah, but he's got stuff.  So no one saw the Pope shit?  That stuff was cool as fuck yesterday.  Was it in the woods?  Oh, you got the Pope being announced.  Great.  Oh, that's good.  A lot of pomp and circumstances, they call it.  A lot of fanfare.  A lot of, what's the other word?  I could do this all day.  Wow. 
[00:04:00]  Celebration.  Sure.  A lot of people bearing witness.  Bearing witness.  I like that one.  A lot of people were bearing witness to what was going on.  That's good.  At the Vatican.  Like that.  So the white smoke appears and then everyone's like, holy fuck, there's going to be an announcement.  I can't believe it.  And then they just start pouring in.  I don't believe it.  They start pouring in to get a good spot.  Yes.  In the St. Peter's Square.  St. Peter's Square, of course.  Did you see how far that window was away from the action? 
[00:04:30]  Which window?  Did you even see any of the footage after the fact?  That he peeked out of?  Yeah.  You think people are right below, but they're just not.  They keep them way the fuck back.  Oh, they're like way the fuck back?  Really?  I thought they were right there, too.  And then from that point, it goes way the fuck back even further.  Oh.  So I don't know why you would pour into St. Peter's Square to get a glimpse of this  when you could barely see any there.  Yeah, to be part of it.  Maybe just to feel the energy?  Yeah.  Well, that's 1979.  Well, when John Paul. 
[00:05:00]  John Paul.  He really looked like a pope, didn't he?  Very popely.  That guy was like a rock star as far as popes go.  He was a young, vibrant pope when he was elected pope.  Yeah.  And then the new guy stepped out onto that balcony and all hell broke loose.  Yeah, they go wild.  Yeah, they went wild.  Like Elvis.  Yeah, man.  No one else saw this.  What time did it happen, first of all?  Well, it happened around, I'm trying to think, somewhere, I don't know, it took a while. 
[00:05:30]  Somewhere around three in the afternoon, I guess, more or less.  Three in the afternoon.  I think I was nursing a little glass of wine and playing some SimCity.  So, I didn't see the pope-dom.  You gotta add a pope to your SimCity game.  That would be great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He looks kind of pope-ish.  He looks, I told you before the show, he looks kind of like a movie pope.  Movie pope.  Central casting pope.  Yeah, when you see those movies and they have to have a pope in there and it's, you know, 
[00:06:00]  they just kind of throw a guy in there.  Mm-hmm.  He'd kind of have that look to him.  Yeah.  Nothing really special, but I mean, he's an interesting choice, though.  If you're not going to go young pope, you go with a pope like this, who's kind of downplaying  the whole fucking pope thing.  This goes with what we were saying about the age of the pope.  You obviously want a guy that, because he's in there supposedly for life, unlike the last  fucking slacker that quit.  Sure.  But it's like, you want a pope that's not going to be in there too long. 
[00:06:30]  You can't give a guy that much power for that length of time.  But it's like the life of a bunny rabbit or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like in his little hutch in the yard.  Yeah.  What could he do?  Maybe 10 years?  Exactly.  That's just it.  They just want someone in there for a little while.  A little while.  Just, you know, they don't want a guy that's going to be in there 30 fucking years, because  the amount of power, influence, and, you know, absolute power corrupts absolutely.  You get him that long in there, and he's going to start pulling shenanigans.  Well, how about they pay attention to America and do the president thing? 
[00:07:00]  Term limits on pope.  You give him the four years, and if they do good, you give him another four, but after  that, you've got to go.  Eight years would be plenty for any pope.  It seems to have worked all right, though, with this whole, you know, you're in there  till you drop.  Well, if you get the guys in their 70s, of course.  Yeah.  You know, the average man only lives to about 70, what, six.  Yeah.  So he's already on borrowed time with one lung as the pope.  One lunged pope.  Wow.  But this guy, very interesting.  He lives in a little apartment. 
[00:07:30]  No more, by the way.  Yeah, that whole thing is fucking bizarre.  I guess he kind of downplays the whole thing.  He refuses a lot of help, so he lives in a tiny little apartment.  They said he cooks his own food, so he doesn't have really people kind of taking care of him  as much.  And then, as a cardinal, he fucking rode the bus to work every day.  Yeah.  So the people that he was in charge of got to kind of talk to him on the bus every morning.  Oh, he must have loved that.  I bet he felt like Nicolas Cage with Jimmy next to him.  Like, oh, well, we, there are many impoverished people that need, oh, boy. 
[00:08:00]  Huh?  Say, huh?  Your holiness.  Huh?  Yeah.  There is a problem in the village.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  What I find completely fascinating, though, he came to the Vatican, Vatican City, as just  another one of these cardinal schmucks.  Yep.  All right, we all got to get together and, you know, vote for the Pope there.  Packed a little carry-on bag with him. 
[00:08:30]  He's got a return flight to Buenos Aires.  Yeah.  He's like, all right, I got to go there for a little bit.  I'll be back, everyone.  Sure.  And then they pick him, who, by the way, he was the runner-up to the other guy that is  now retired.  Yeah.  He came in second last time around.  And he could never go home again.  He can't now go, wow, that's cool that you elected me Pope, but I got to clean up some shit  in Buenos Aires.  He can't ever go to his nice little apartment.  I don't think so.  I don't think they ever get a chance to go back home.  What if he has stuff there he needs? 
[00:09:00]  Someone will get it.  I think they just have people for that.  But the life he knows is completely gone.  And now he probably writes a list like, well, could you at least feed my stupid cat or bring  my cat here?  Get to my watch.  Bedside table.  I'm the kangaroo.  I can't go to his apartment.  He came in second, by the way, for the last election.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But his whole life completely changes in a blink of an eye like that.  Wow.  And he can never really go back.  I mean, I'm sure he'll visit as the Pope. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, but he'll never live in his little place.  Like, from one day to the next, you go from, all right, that's kind of cool, that's it.  And then you're the Pope.  Does anyone know how this actually works?  But I assume he just doesn't go back to clean up.  No, he can't.  He's the Pope.  What's he going to do?  They guard these guys.  And, you know, he's...  He's now the guy that needs to be in the Popemobile.  He doesn't fucking just walk around.  He doesn't take the bus.  The whole life of his that he's known ends right there. 
[00:10:00]  Just like that.  And his whole life is replaced by being this Pope.  He looked really nervous on that balcony.  Did he?  Was he nervous, Pope?  Yeah, because he's like, what the hell?  I came here as this one thing, and now I'm the main guy.  He's like the landlord in coming to America.  When they're like, look, we need this shitty apartment.  Do you want our apartment?  And when they put the landlord downstairs in that fucking luxurious apartment, that's what it's like.  That is, yeah.  One day you're here, and the next day you're just not anymore. 
[00:10:30]  The next day you're pretty amazing.  Big fucking man on campus.  It was pretty cool.  You could just feel the energy through the TV.  It was just, I don't know, something you just don't get to see a lot.  Where were you watching that, Opie?  Well, I do have other TVs.  So you weren't watching in the living room?  No.  I was watching it on one of my smaller TVs.  I had to go with the 50-inch.  It sucks.  Oh, boy.  Fucking 50-inch.  How do you see that?  You have a magnifying glass? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  50-inch.  Jeez.  Take a vow of poverty or something?  What the fuck?  Then, of course, my kid has to go, this isn't my program.  He doesn't want to watch the Pope.  This isn't my show.  This isn't my show.  He goes, this is Daddy's show.  And I'm like, ugh.  Daddy's show.  In other words, this sucks.  Yeah.  Because kids love fucking, they don't like pomp and circumstance.  I do have the greatest idea that can make me a very rich man.  I want to go on Shark Tank.  Little Pope?  Nope.  I'm going to go on Shark Tank, Sam. 
[00:11:30]  Okay.  You're friends with Mr. Wonderful.  Get me on there.  I can get you.  I want some kind of app that you can put on TV that turns everything into animation.  Into cartoon.  And then you can still watch your shows and kids would watch along with you.  That's fucking brilliant.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  Thank you.  It turns everything into animation.  Yeah.  Like cartoon looking.  Yeah.  So you have it after that.  So kids are like, oh.  They have one already.  It's called Ritalin.  I am not even joking.  How do we get this done? 
[00:12:00]  Because anything that has any type of cartoon look to it or a little animation, he's done.  He's all right.  They get hypnotized by that shit.  Like I get to watch the old Flintstones and things like that.  I trick them.  I was watching Tom and Jerry yesterday.  It's ancient.  But he loves it, right?  Yeah.  Because it's just, it's animated shit.  It's cartoons.  Anything animated does very well with the kids.  Boy, did I love a good cartoon.  Man, was I a cartoon junkie as a kid.  Yeah.  Loved it.  All day long, right?  Oh, Saturday morning. 
[00:12:30]  I'd ask my mom because I was so stupid as a kid.  I didn't even know it was Saturday.  And I'd be like, is it today, Good Cartoons Day?  I called Saturday Good Cartoons Day because there was cartoons from the morning until the afternoon.  But I think we were watching cartoons well up on, I think we were pushing teenagers as our generation.  Easily still watching.  I fucking watched cartoons well into my 30s.  Right.  But I mean, in general.  Like crazy watched them.  We never really gave up on cartoons when we were growing up.  No.  But anyway, you notice that none of us have attempted the new Pope's name like Mike Francesa did. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, he gave it a whirl.  I saw the tweet, didn't click it.  I got the audio.  It's pretty funny.  Mike Francesa, I guess, announcing the big, he was live on the air when it happened?  Yeah, actually, we got his first start with the Fox, the Fox report here.  Did you guys get the clip I should have asked you?  I think it was Fox.  They couldn't figure out if it was white smoke or black smoke.  Yeah, that's what I pulled.  Oh, you did pull it.  You know, it is a little vague.  Oh, it's pretty funny.  Dude, what's with that smoke, though?  It does kind of, sometimes the black smoke looks white. 
[00:13:30]  You got to relax a little bit.  When it's white smoke, you can tell it's completely white smoke.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's an obvious difference.  Absolutely.  Why don't they just put a flag up?  It's a little easier to see.  How about they fucking...  It's like 2013.  You use a light.  How about we all just stare at our phones all day?  Yeah, exactly, Jimmy.  Yeah, send a tweet.  Just tweet the tweet.  Enough already.  Making everyone wait.  And it was dark out, so they put lights on the smoke and it probably makes Stephen Black  smoke look a little white.  No, that is some white smoke right there, my friend. 
[00:14:00]  Smoke, yeah.  So here's how Fox reported it.  And before I let you go, we have smoke.  It appears...  It appears gray.  Uh-oh, gray.  It's whitish.  Iraq?  Big.  Will we hear the bells ring immediately, Father?  I anticipate, based on what we saw earlier, that that is definitely not black smoke.  Look for Cardinal Angelo Scola to come out on that balcony.  Father, the smoke is white, and it appears we have a new pope as the crowds go wild in 
[00:14:30]  St. Peter's Square in celebration.  It is rather unambiguously white.  One hesitates to say because you don't want to get ahead of yourself, but you can see the  square, the folks in the square are the same as we do.  They won't commit to the color of smoke, but they fucking put false information about  everything else out there.  Jumping the gun.  My opinion is that it's clearly white smoke compared to the type of dark smoke that we 
[00:15:00]  saw yesterday afternoon as well as this morning.  So I anticipate we're going to hear those words, Enuncio Vobis Gaudium Magnum, Abemus  Papam, in the matter of about 45 minutes.  The hell did he just say?  That was something from the exorcist, I think.  Papams?  What the fuck?  Did a little exorcist for everybody.  Crazy.  Look at that.  Well, a pope.  You know, and you hear the excitement, and you watch the excitement, and you realize 
[00:15:30]  that whole kid-touching thing really hasn't messed up the religion that much.  No, they still love him.  It's great.  They still are all in.  It's fantastical.  Latin America, they haven't been hit as hard with this as everywhere else either.  I think that's why they're not a Latin American pope.  You think, though?  Yeah.  You don't think Latin America was hit with that shit?  No, but it hasn't come out.  Like, they're not as anti-church as it's become here.  They said that they're, like, in the 1960s as far as where they're at with the church.  Right.  Where I think some stuff has started, but it's not where it is, like, here or in Boston. 
[00:16:00]  The church is all about taking care of the Hispanics.  There are so many Hispanics that are all in.  Catholic.  Catholic.  Catholic.  Yeah, because Latin America, there's 501.  I learned a lot yesterday.  But let me share a little bit.  501 million Catholics down there.  By far the most.  Yeah, yeah.  Out of anywhere else.  The Spanish people are very Catholic people.  Europe?  Yeah.  Comes in, I think, second at 85 million. 
[00:16:30]  There's a massive drop-off right there.  So a lot of people are surprised they didn't do a Latin American pope before now.  Sooner?  Because there's always been just a ridiculous amount of Catholics out there.  It's a pesky New World thing.  America?  Yeah.  30 million.  That's it, huh?  Catholics.  30 million Catholics?  And a third of those?  Hispanic.  Whoa.  Yeah, so 10 million out of our 30 million are Hispanics.  That's crazy.  So this is a great choice for everybody.  Pope Francis.  Right?  Francis. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  I wanted to do the line from my stripes.  I was trying to work that into a tweet.  It's like fucking, yeah.  Lighten up, Francis.  Call me the Pope.  Right.  Call me Francis, and I'll kill you.  Right.  Lighten up, Francis.  Right.  Hey, you homos.  Hey, you homos.  Call me Francis.  Which is all of you.  You know what?  Cardinal Cruiser.  No, that guy.  They call me the Cruiser. 
[00:17:30]  Dude, they.  And then the best was John Candy.  They should have called him the dork.  Such a great comeback.  Oh, yeah.  One of those movies, man.  The first half was amazing.  Yeah.  And then the second half was just weird.  A little.  Got a little stupid.  They had to get the broads involved and all that.  Yeah.  Except.  It's my candy going for the movie.  Except for the scene where they're mud wrestling and fucking John Larroquette.  That's my favorite moment in the movie.  Where the fucking ox is all covered in mud.  He's like, well, we're on our way to bingo parlor.  Shut up. 
[00:18:00]  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  I didn't watch Stripes.  I think that one holds up.  The beginning, like you said.  Probably the beginning.  And then once they get in that RV thing and start doing that, it gets a little weird.  But the whole thing of boot camp and all that shit is just great.  John Candy's funny, though, when they're over in Europe.  And then all the guns.  Come on, boys.  Hand them up.  Hand them up.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Hand them up.  There you go.  So Mike Francesa was on the air.  We can't get enough of this guy. 
[00:18:30]  Everyone else is starting to enjoy Mike Francesa.  Did he doze off during the smoke?  We've known about him for years, obviously.  And I don't know, man.  His clips go viral very easily.  Oh, people love him.  He just kind of just wings it every day.  And he kind of got caught with this one.  He did?  I think so.  People are enjoying this clip.  Yeah, I love it.  Mike interrupts a caller to wrongly name the new pope.  Not an easy name to say, in all fairness.  Well, that's why you say now Pope Francis. 
[00:19:00]  It's easy.  Hey, just go Pope Francis.  He's always eaten.  He's always eaten it.  Whenever they do an interview after the game, they bring him in the post.  He always takes the blame.  The pope is...  Is that the pope?  Scala is the pope, huh?  So the Italian is the pope.  So the favorite is the pope.  It was the lead Italian who is the next pope.  Is that it?  Was that the...  They just flashed Scala up there.  Is that him?  No, it's not Scala. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  Scala.  Oh, Mike.  Learned a little bit about that, too.  He was the odds-on favorite going into the whole thing.  Was he?  Yeah, the Scala guy.  But it wasn't Scala.  No.  No.  Is that it?  Was that the...  Was that the...  They just flashed Scala up there.  Is that him?  Well, they just put Scala up there.  Was he...  They announced he's the pope?  Right.  They just put his picture up.  Scala, he's the...  Enough about Scala.  He was considered the favorite.  He was the lead Italian. 
[00:20:00]  Was that just a picture of him that went up by accident?  Or was that...  I don't have the sound on.  Was that a picture?  Was that him?  But they just put a picture of him up on...  Holy shit!  In MSNBC, they just put a picture of Scala up.  He's infuriating.  Were they announcing that he's the pope or not?  Is he so pompous?  Were they just announcing that he's the favorite?  Okay.  So you guys are watching CBS.  We'll see what happens there.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Because they put up...  Who'd they put up? 
[00:20:30]  They showed a slide with Scala now.  He's been the favorite all along.  Has he?  But I don't know if they showed a slide.  Maybe that was by accident.  Well, maybe they're discussing that he's the favorite.  Holy shit.  He fucking stinks.  No one else is putting anything up yet, so maybe he's not.  They pay him so much fucking money.  You hear him just rambling on?  What a boy.  Scala?  Was that Scala?  They put his picture up.  He's the favorite Italian.  He's the one. 
[00:21:00]  Is he the pope?  Scala?  Did Scala?  They picked Scala.  They put his picture up.  Was that a mistake?  Because he's the Italian.  He was the Italian guard.  The favorite.  Scala?  Did they put Scala?  Oh, my God.  Enough about Scala.  Right.  That's what happens when you have a team, and all of a sudden it's one guy.  He's been used to talking to somebody else for so many years, but he's just doing both parts now.  Oh, he's fucking poor.  So then Mike delivers a riveting edge-of-your-seat papal announcement here.  Ooh.  All right?  Can't wait. 
[00:21:30]  Here's the official announcement from our pal Mike Francesa.  This is...  Who is this man?  This is the senior cardinal?  Okay.  So he'll announce the name of the new pope.  Tell me what it is.  News of great joy.  We have a pope.  The pope's name is cardinal.  Do we get it first as cardinal, or do we get his name as a pope now?  Oh, what? 
[00:22:00]  Whoa.  Boy, look how many people are there.  My God.  The play-by-play is fantastic.  Did you say who it was, guys?  I don't see anything printed on the screen.  I don't have the sound on, folks.  I can't tell you what it says.  Oh, these guys couldn't understand what he was saying inside.  Sam, as an up-and-coming broadcaster, how mad are you?  Because I remember these days where I go, 
[00:22:30]  I just know in my fucking soul I'm better than some of these guys that are, you know, way bigger.  It's one thing to have moments of silence and be natural.  He does this every day.  But it's like chunks of time where there is no sound.  And how could anybody be listening to it?  Because he don't give a fuck.  He knows he's untouchable.  He knows CBS loves them because they're all about sports talk right now.  So he's like, fuck, I got this gig.  You have ten seconds of dead air broken up with a deep breath five seconds in. 
[00:23:00]  And that's it.  And then erroneous information.  Oh, it gets better.  I assume, wait a minute, Scola is now the shortstop for the Cardinals?  Wait, what?  And he's doing nothing that's, he doesn't have to be funny, but he should be at least engaging.  There's nothing funny or engaging or any different than any other schlub watching television.  Why are you bringing me rock into this?  Oh, oh, see, I thought.  He's just lousy.  He's lousy and he's on because you can leave it on. 
[00:23:30]  He's lazy.  You can just leave it on.  Because that's the hot format right now.  So, you know.  He knows sports, but he's just a bore.  And he's been around for so long, people just tune in as a habit.  But who enjoys that guy?  Who enjoys his opinions or his voice?  I don't know.  Okay.  Okay.  I love when they prank him.  I know you're out there.  Terrible.  Man, keep it going.  I haven't heard one in a while.  What's wrong with you guys?  He knows that just his voice, people would just listen because they're used to hearing his voice.  Right.  So he literally does no work.  Right.  At all.  Right.  I was at a post office one time listening to him while I was doing something. 
[00:24:00]  I'm like, that's why he makes the money.  Because you can leave him on everywhere.  Guys can listen to him because he's talking about something that they want to hear.  And he's never going to get you in any trouble.  Yeah, but you could get another guy to do that.  That's a little more engaging.  I totally agree.  With a little more energy.  You can get anybody to do that.  A little more passion.  The guy has absolutely no passion for what he does.  Like, there could easily.  What?  Yeah.  Scala.  You can get a guy that doesn't get anybody in trouble, but a guy who, like, will make you stop and go, 
[00:24:30]  Oh, what did he just say?  He's really into it.  That's interesting.  Let me listen to this.  Yeah, exactly.  That's interesting.  A little energy.  Something.  Oh, you got to hear this.  Does anybody go, oh, you got to hear what Mike said today?  Nope.  Nope.  So here's the rest of his announcement.  I don't have the sound on, folks.  I can't tell you what it says.  Oh, these guys couldn't understand what he was saying inside.  So they didn't put up a graphic yet, so we don't have a graphic.  The cardinal from, this is it, the archbishop. 
[00:25:00]  Well, he's an archbishop, though.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is it.  Cardinal.  This is the pope.  Who's the pope?  From Argentina.  He's it?  He's it.  Is that it?  You're it.  So Cardinal Jorge Mario Rivera Bergoglio.  He's the new pope?  The cardinal from Argentina.  Okay, so the cardinal from Argentina.  Cardinal.  76-year-old pope. 
[00:25:30]  So they went for an older pope.  Okay, so Cardinal.  Cardinal.  Cardinal.  You guys will tell me when they say it inside, how you say his name.  And then we'll find out what his papal name is.  Basically, the cardinal from Argentina.  There might be two.  I don't even know if there are two from Argentina.  But the cardinal from Argentina, the 76-year-old cardinal from Argentina.  The guy that announced the Hindenburg crash had it more together than fucking Mikey. 
[00:26:00]  He's like a smoke of boring.  It's like a smoldering odor.  Just hanging out in the room.  It just envelops you.  It crushes you.  Oh, God.  He's so full of himself.  He's ridiculously full of himself.  He won't let his producers talk on the air.  Because you can tell they're talking in his headphones.  Right.  And it's just, he would rather have silence than anybody else's voice on his show.  And I think that, well, who am I to say?  Because he's still doing it.  But that seems to be a mistake. 
[00:26:30]  If you've got guys that might give you a little more energy and you could actually have a conversation with, I think that would sound better.  Like, imagine if that was a two-way conversation we just heard.  Instead of Mike seemingly talking to himself going, oh, no.  I can't hear the TV.  Oh, God.  There's no graphic.  Yeah.  Yep.  Who was that?  I thought he was an archbishop.  He's a cardinal?  Cardinal?  Cardinal?  Cardinal?  Or an archbishop?  I think there's two.  I think there's two.  Are there two popes now? 
[00:27:00]  We're running with the two popes.  We got the pop and the reliever coming in.  They're bringing in the relief pop.  Anyway.  And then, finally, the new popes spoke.  Let us pray for the whole world because let us have a big brotherhood.  I heard, okay, I know that.  Let us pray inside. 
[00:27:30]  Silence your prayer to me.  Marecón.  Muerda.  There you go.  There you go.  Smart move by the church.  Smart move.  Smart by the church for what reason?  I think so.  Because in Latin America, they're not completely biased against the pope.  Biblioteca.  And the religion.  I think that's a smart move.  Interesting.  There's something different.  Yeah.  Of course, an old guy. 
[00:28:00]  Of course.  Another one that's there for fucking eight years, nine years.  Nobody that can actually do anything.  No.  They don't want anybody who can do too much.  No.  You're never going to get a 60-year-old pope.  But are there even 60-year-old cardinals?  Probably late 60s.  I think so, yeah.  Like, what are the ages of some of these cardinals?  Yeah, Dolan.  Dolan's a cardinal, isn't he?  He's got to be mid-60s by now, at least, no?  I don't think anyone's younger than probably 65, I would guess.  There is one.  The youngest cardinal is from India, and it's 53. 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  But that's like a thing.  Holy shit.  Indian cardinal.  Wow.  53.  That hat is zany.  It really is.  Wow.  He's got like one of those big, you know how a lot of time in the Russian Orthodox churches  have that big onion-y looking top on it?  That's what it looks like.  No, it looks like a Hershey's Kiss.  Oh, he's wearing a Hershey's Kiss hat.  Yeah.  A giant Hershey's Kiss hat.  Yeah, there he is. 
[00:29:00]  New Pope.  Finally, all this.  I won't have to hear the word conclave anymore.  Conclave.  Conclave.  And what, they take the chimney down now?  Take that chimney down.  You know what I heard, though?  Huh?  Fucking half a million dollars to take that chimney down.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  It costs a lot.  People thought we were bullshitting yesterday.  They're like, do you understand how much property and what kind of house you can build for $500,000?  To build an entire nice house. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Am I just taking a wall down?  If you didn't hear, we're most likely not getting the wall removed because it's going  to cost $400,000 to $500,000.  That was told to us.  And we just sat there like, I'm not even going to acknowledge you said that.  I simply don't believe it.  I simply don't believe it.  I don't either.  Because this wall being knocked down, it costs a few grand.  And you don't have to redo all the ductwork.  Anthony knows that world.  If it's going to be our space, I would just say, fuck it.  Who cares?  Of course.  Who gives a fuck?  It goes under like a renovation, not a fucking new installation. 
[00:30:00]  It's crazy.  Right.  There's no reason for that.  Bullshit.  It's bullshit.  No reason.  Yeah.  God almighty.  Let's get a giant fan in here if we have to.  Ooh.  Exactly.  Big A.  I was going to say, fuck.  You beat me to it.  I was setting up my own joke and you beat me to it.  Damn.  Ooh, itchy.  All right.  That's all the Pope news we need, right?  I guess.  I mean, what else is there, really?  I guess they're sending Biden in as the American delegation to watch him become the Pope or something. 
[00:30:30]  What do they do?  They give him a little ceremony?  But isn't he the Pope right now?  He is the Pope right now, but then he's got to go through the whole thing.  The whole?  Yeah.  The whole circus?  Yeah.  All that shit.  All that shit.  I don't know.  And when does he get to go back to his tiny apartment and get his shit?  He ain't going back there and getting his shit.  That just...  I'm obsessed with that.  Him and another cardinal loading a U-Haul.  Right.  Just like, all right, grab the couch.  No, the other way.  Turn it.  Turn it.  Trying to fucking move like regular guys. 
[00:31:00]  He can't even go to the bathroom by himself anymore.  No.  I don't think they're even allowed to do that.  The Pope's penis.  He was a big shot before that.  Came in second last time and he knew John Paul II.  But man, he just went...  Now billions of people know who he is.  That's it.  Nobody knew him before other than hardcore religious people.  Yeah.  You know, locally he was...  Yeah, sure.  Maybe a little bit here and there.  But you're right.  Now he's the guy that everyone's like, okay, you represent us, motherfucker.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Argentina, huh?  Buenos Aires.  Stand back.  Buenos Aires.  Buenos Aires.  You are...  Just a little bit of star quality.  Hey, Jesus.  That's...  Well, Jesus.  That's pretty good.  It's over.  I was really getting a little tired of the whole thing.  Every day.  It was definitely fun to watch as the anticipation grew and the energy grew there in St. Peter's  Square.  Any other religion have any big things that get that kind of coverage? 
[00:32:00]  Not really.  When they do some kind of big thing?  I mean...  When they do the old switcheroo and get the new guy in there?  Maybe a Muslim fucking bombing.  That gets a lot of coverage.  Not like this, though.  Those people, the jihads.  But every religion has their main guy, right?  Do they?  Why don't we...  You got it.  I don't know.  Like, the Jews...  Who do the Jews got?  They have to have a main guy.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss is their main guy?  Ah!  We got other religions that listen to us.  Who are your main guys?  I want to know.  Like, is there a Jewish main guy?  There has to be.  There's a Pope version, right.  You can't have everyone just willy-nilly trying to figure out the religion thing. 
[00:32:30]  You got to have one focus.  You need it.  I think Jews have so many different factions of Judaism...  Right.  ...that each one...  You know, you get, like, the Hasidics got that one guy.  Well, who's the one guy?  He's the guy.  All right.  And then...  There's no lead Muslim, I don't think.  What?  There's no lead Muslim.  Like, there's not one...  Because you have the Imams and all these guys and the Mullahs.  But there's not one head Muslim that I know of.  You got to think they have to have one guy, though, just for it all to kind of trickle down from. 
[00:33:00]  Ah.  What I'm reading is the Jews, their only one guy is God.  Wow.  Whoa!  They go right to the top.  Yeah.  No middleman.  Cut out the middleman!  No middle management for that.  No.  There's no Pope type.  We cut out the middleman and pass the savings on to you!  What about the Muslims?  They don't have one guy.  Muslims?  What do they got?  Who do they got?  Yeah.  Osama bin Laden?  Who's the guy?  They don't have one.  I bet you they don't have one. 
[00:33:30]  Or another one?  The Muslims and Jews are smarter than the Catholics.  Catholics figured it all out.  How silly.  Right.  Catholics figured it all out how to get the most money from their flock.  Yeah.  You put a bunch of guys in charge and just go, hey, come on, cough up.  How do we put one big filter before God?  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Because if you're the filter between people and God, you could pull a lot of shit, man.  Right.  You got a lot of juice, as they say.  Sure.  Your holiness?  Yeah.  You're calling the Pope your holiness.  Right.  And I hate when they call priests father.  Right.  He's supposed to address God's father. 
[00:34:00]  He's the representative right there.  No one's calling.  Who's your guy?  I want to know.  There isn't central leadership.  Not since, you know, there's no central leadership for Muslims either.  Since, what, Muhammad, right?  Yeah, yeah.  When you started with it.  And I saw...  Ali?  No.  Crazy.  Muhammad Ali's the leader of the Muslims?  The head of the Muslims.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't know that.  That's pretty cool.  That is.  Got to break him out at a sporting event.  Hindus.  That hasn't been done yet, huh?  Hindus.  You got Buddha.  And then that fucking elephant with all the arms.  Right? 
[00:34:30]  Vishnu.  What?  What about the Dalai Lama?  Is he the head muckety-muck for somebody?  He's that Tibetan guy.  But who does he represent?  Tibetans.  That's it?  I think so.  God, that's not that big of a deal.  Why is he so famous?  The Dalai Lama?  Because he's like the guy that wants freedom from Tibet.  But I mean, does he...  How many people is he...  I think it's like up to 15,000.  Oh, boy.  The monks?  That's about it.  I thought it was there. 
[00:35:00]  No, that's about it, I think, on that one.  Just a little...  Kind of like a little...  Yeah.  Tibetan Buddhists, yeah.  Yeah.  Tibetan Buddhists.  Tibetan Buddhists.  Not Buddhist Buddhists.  No, no.  Tibetan Buddhists.  What are they gambling on?  Fuck!  Because they're betting.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  Whoa.  So the Pope is the only one.  Yeah, dude.  They're the only real leader.  All that money for the Vatican, and all those robes, and all that gold, and all that...  It's nonsense.  It just seems a little counterproductive to what, you know, would be good. 
[00:35:30]  They said this guy worked with poor people, and a lot of them...  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  But as an individual, they said this guy was pretty good.  Yeah.  He seems like a good choice, I guess, if you're in that world.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Who else was there?  The Scola guy.  Who was the...  Scola?  Scola was there.  Is he a cardinal?  Scola's got to be bummed out today.  Yeah.  Swing and a miss for him.  Everyone was thinking he was going to be the guy. 
[00:36:00]  No dice for Scola.  He gets to use his return ticket.  That's it.  Not Cole Francis, though.  You ripped that up.  You ain't going back.  You're not going back anytime soon.  Because now it has to be a big special trip that he has to do.  When he goes to Argentina...  Which he will.  He will.  It's going to be like a fucking rock star in a giant stadium with thousands upon thousands  of people.  He's not going to trod back to his little apartment, put the key in the door, and pick 
[00:36:30]  up his fucking...  No, that's what I'm saying.  Get his cat.  Yeah.  That's what I've been wrapping my head around.  I think that is really fucking cool and really overwhelming for the guy.  It's like Voss after the last comic standing.  He would come around, he'd be okay, and then all of a sudden a couple episodes airs, and  he couldn't go anywhere without being swarmed.  You're the ironing guy.  Oh, that's you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Obsessed with Voss today.  He's all I'm thinking.  I miss him.  The Mormons have a prophet. 
[00:37:00]  Joseph Smith?  Certain sects of the Jews have a head guy.  Yeah, I know certain sects of Jews.  The grand rabbi.  The Muslim used to have the caliph.  Who?  Shlomo?  Caliph.  How do you say that?  Caliphate, I was saying.  Caliphate, but that was gone.  They got rid of that in the 20s.  Caliphate.  And the Ayatollah is leader of Iran, but Muslim leader.  So all that shit's coming in right now.  But it's not like the Pope. 
[00:37:30]  What about, yeah, what about Scientology?  Scientology has Tom Cruise.  They got St. Cruz.  St. Cruz.  And St. Travolta.  Yep.  They're fighting it out for the main spot, I guess, right now.  For the main fucking muckety-muck.  The head muckety-muck.  With Will Smith watching over those two.  Oh, shit.  Waiting for them to fuck up.  Is he a Scientologist?  I do believe he is.  Every successful guy in Hollywood.  A lot of them are, man.  He's another one of those biggies that does the Scientology thing.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Good for the Pope and the Catholics. 
[00:38:00]  All those priests and local guys that have been on the news for the past fucking week,  two weeks, whatever it's been.  Oh, my God.  Those guys are so low-level guys.  Oh, gosh.  They're extremely low-level guys.  They always go to him, well, last night we prayed that there would be a Pope.  When you see a priest on TV just in the black with the cute little white collar, you're like,  oh, God. 
[00:38:30]  You see what they're showing at the Vatican?  That's like the pawn on the chessboard.  That's like the first thing you get is a Boy Scout.  Yeah, yeah.  It's way better than that.  You're a fucking wee-blow.  Yeah, you don't even get to wear a hat yet.  It's a wee-blow of the church.  Right.  Yeah, you don't get a fucking hat.  Yeah, they all are.  What's the first hat you get to wear?  Because the priests I saw on TV, they're not at the hat stage.  And what is the first hat leading up to the Pope hat?  Oh, man.  There is something where all of a sudden you get to start wearing hats. 
[00:39:00]  They wear the little, almost like a yarmulke.  It's like a bigger version of a yarmulke.  Yeah, but how high up in the organization do you have to go?  Because all the churches I've been in my life, I've never seen a priest with one of those hats.  I'm reading here that the duty hat is the first hat that they're able to wear.  Oh, boy!  Oh, Jesus.  What's after a priest?  You have cardinals right before a pope.  Right.  You got some bishops in there, some archbishops.  Archbishop. 
[00:39:30]  Then you got, I don't know what's below that.  What's the hierarchy, Sam?  Let's go.  What do you think?  Oh, man.  I would say.  But when you, I'm obsessed.  Priest, Monsignor.  Monsignor?  Is that when you get to start wearing the hats?  Bishop?  I don't know.  Is it Monsignor, and then Bishop, and then Archbishop, and then Cardinal?  Like leveling up in fucking World of Warcraft.  And where do the Jesuits fit into this whole thing?  The Jesuits are part of the Catholic Church. 
[00:40:00]  They commit themselves to the peer.  They like helping the peer people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Um, what about the hats?  I want to know about the hats.  So what kind of hat does the priest wear before he gets that big fucking cock hat like the Pope wears?  That big unclipped cock hat.  Eek!  Nice.  Hey, there's some smoke. 
[00:40:30]  Hey, go figure.  I guess they picked the Pope.  Ow!  Yeah.  Little boy sued.  Okay, we're looking up hats now.  That's the Beretta?  Beretta.  Beretta, yeah.  Beretta, B-I-R-E-T-A.  Oh, that's that square looking, it looks like Chinese takeout box with a pom-pom on top. 
[00:41:00]  It really does.  Very good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To keep the lo mein all nice and fresh.  Yes.  But then that damn box gets soggy if you don't eat right away.  Who gets to wear the Beretta, Sam Roberts?  That can also, it's worn by obviously the clergy, but it can also be worn academically.  For academic dress, the way we might wear a graduation hat.  Oh.  That's right.  No tassel?  Occasionally, the Beretta is worn by advocates in law courts, for instance. 
[00:41:30]  I've seen that.  Yeah, that's no religious shit.  That's kind of, I mean, it's a multi-use hat.  Yeah, that's fringe religious stuff.  We want just strictly fucking religious hat.  A Camaro?  You can wear a Camaro on your head.  Hey, hey, Maria, it's a fucking Camaro.  Gonna have some fucked up discs.  It's like a Santa hat beanie.  That's the Santa hat thing.  It's the Santa hat without the pom-pom on top.  Right.  It's red.  It's got the white little fluffy stuff around the edge. 
[00:42:00]  But when do you get to wear that?  That's traditionally worn by the Pope.  See?  Whoa!  We're talking about the first hat.  Lower, yeah.  We want the first hat you're allowed to wear.  You got the priest.  Oh, here's the Capello Romano.  Oh, I had some of that last night.  Oh, my mother makes it melt in your mouth.  The Capello Romano.  Forget about it.  Oh, forget about it.  With the fucking artichoke hearts and much love.  That was the mother on One Day at a Time, was this?  Oh, whoops.  She's dead now, too. 
[00:42:30]  Is she?  Yeah, and Romano just died.  We lost her a couple weeks ago.  What's your real name?  Bonnie something.  Bonnie Franklin.  Bonnie Franklin died.  So whoop on the silk pillow.  I think it was last weekend while we were enjoying her weekends.  Yeah.  Capello Romano.  That's the red old lady hat that the Pope...  That's another Pope hat!  Oh, that's the cowboy hat.  Oh, oh, oh.  There's a butt in there.  More than just Popes can wear it.  Generally, the red one.  Yeah, rodeo riders.  It's a fucking cowboy hat. 
[00:43:00]  See?  You can just be regular clergy.  That's the Father Guido Sarducci hat.  Yes.  Right.  Very good.  Let's rename that.  Father Guido Sarducci.  A cardinal, for instance, may have a capello with red and gold cords with scarlet lining.  A bishop may have green and gold cords with violet lining.  A priest may substitute the black lining for his.  Oh, so he's just got to wear the black one with the priest thing.  Black, uh...  Color-coded.  Almost cowboy hat.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Let's see. 
[00:43:30]  Let's go.  Are we going down?  Yeah.  To Galero.  She loves the taste of communion wafers, Father.  She loves the taste of communion wafers.  Uh...  Galero made famous by Cardinal Jean Chalette.  Oh.  Yeah.  What does that look like?  Oh.  It looks very similar to the hat we just saw.  That does.  The brim's a little wider, and there's little pom-poms that hang down.  Aw.  All right, sir.  That's fun.  All right.  That's cute.  Let's see.  All right. 
[00:44:00]  How many more we got?  Oh, this is the pulpit, the meat tray.  The meat tray.  Yes.  Meat day.  I mean, I think John Paul probably made this.  I like a good meat tray.  That is the white pulp hat with the gold trim that the pulp wears.  All right.  Anyone else?  Bishops can wear it, too.  What?  Whoa.  Well, that is like when you see a bishop on a chessboard, he's wearing that hat.  The meat tray.  That's what the pointy part of the bishop on a chessboard is, that hat.  That's right. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Check out the mantilla, which is for the ladies.  Why would a lady wear a mantilla?  But shouldn't it be like a fucking, like a man woman?  No.  It should be like a lady.  Tell her something.  When we come back, I'll have something.  That's a fucking tough one.  Thank God.  What's the mantilla?  Is that some nun shit?  Well, yeah.  It's like a big tall hat.  You see these ladies.  They dress up when they want to dress nice.  They'll wear mantillas.  What is the Sister Betrill habit called?  Very good.  Remember that? 
[00:45:00]  The Sister Betrill?  She had the big flying nun.  Flying nun.  Child of the 80s shit.  She had, like, wings, but they had winglets on the end, too, for stability or something.  Yeah, because you've got to fly around.  At the Convent Santanko.  Of course, the papal tiara is papal.  Papal.  Papal.  You say papal.  I say papal.  Let's call the whole thing off.  Don't forget deacons, too.  Deacons are below priest.  Yeah, deacons are the bottom.  Deacons, priest, bishop.  And what about the zuchetto? 
[00:45:30]  The zuchetto is the little, uh...  Oh, that's the little beanie thing.  Fake yarmulke deal.  Oh, that's the Catholic version of the yarmulke.  Right.  And it comes in white or red.  Do we see priests wearing that sometimes?  You can.  Maybe?  Sure.  No, um...  I've never really seen a priest wear this zuchetto.  I've seen priests wear those.  The zuchetto?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Flying nun hair real quick.  Do you know there's only 178 cardinals worldwide?  Yes.  I didn't realize there's that few.  Yes.  The pope appoints them.  Yes.  The pope gets to appoint the cardinals? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, those are the guys above the archbishop.  John Paul appointed Pope Francis there.  Back in 2001, if you need to know.  Mm-hmm.  What's the difference between a bishop and an archbishop?  Archbishop probably leads the bishops.  He's like the district manager.  I think the bishops probably are these, uh...  He's a...  They're regional managers.  The archbishop's probably the regional managers.  District manager, regional manager.  Oh!  That's a good way to put it.  He's a bishop that doesn't have flat feet.  Oh!  Yes.  Where's the flying nun hat? 
[00:46:30]  When you look that up, you kind of get a lot of Halloween costumes.  No.  No, no.  This is a real deal.  The flying nun hat.  It must be some Spanish sect.  Maybe, because it didn't make the...  It's all about trying to make the nuns look as ugly as possible.  Well, Sister Patril had the big nun hat with the wings, but then she also, when she was just  hanging around the convent, had that little flowy, like raggy thing that you knew she couldn't  fly with, but kind of made her look a little more girlish.  Well, you can imagine what her hair would look like if they were allowed to wear it down. 
[00:47:00]  Yes, exactly.  Who the hell approached her and said, look, we got this show.  You're going to play a nun.  Oh, that's cool.  But you fly.  You're a flying nun.  And she was like, yeah.  Instead of going, oh, I want to shoot my fucking agent.  Right.  She said, yeah.  But why would they start flying again?  I forgot.  Didn't something have to happen?  Well...  More than just wind?  Yeah, Bert punched her really hard off a building.  No, she was so petite and tiny. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  And her habit was so big that she was able to fly.  Oh, she had special powers?  She explained it, how, you know, the drag lift coefficient and everything, she explained  that in an episode.  But it was ridiculous.  But it was no special power.  She could just fly.  Oh, that's dumb.  I always thought she had a special power.  Opie, that would be silly.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So why wouldn't they just remove the hat?  But she liked flying.  And everyone knew she flew.  This wasn't something she kept secret, like Superman. 
[00:48:00]  She was the flying nun.  Why did they all get fucking hats?  Because she was, like, light.  She was a little petite, little sister Patrille.  She could fly.  What a dumb show.  But Superior was big and fat, and she couldn't fly.  God, you remember this shit.  And Carlos was the guy that used to come around, and he was the Latin lover.  Which was a little edgy.  It was a little weird, because, like, she's a nun.  She's a nun, and he's looking to fucking stick his penis in something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a little strange.  But why wouldn't they, if it was a windy day, just keep her inside? 
[00:48:30]  They didn't care if she flew.  And she liked flying.  Well, after a while, you know, it was handy.  Like, they used her for things.  Like, oh, Sister Patrille, something's missing out there.  We'll go find it.  And she'd be like, she'd put her hand on her little habit and go, just start flying around.  What if she flew into some shit?  Yeah, she could deal with it.  Yeah, she wasn't allowed near LaGuardia.  Yeah.  Or JFK. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Imagine your drone takes a picture of a nun flying by.  The flying nun.  With a book.  Sam, find us a clip from the flying nun.  Ah!  Find the best clip possible from the flying nun.  Of her flying, of course.  This is part of our Pope Francis coverage, by the way.  Yes, yes.  Doing a terrific job here.  We take you into different areas that the major networks aren't covering.  Like the flying nun.  I swear to you, until this moment, I thought she had some special powers, and that's why she flew.  Nope.  It was all about a dumb hat.  See there?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Here's the promo. 
[00:49:30]  How many years was this old?  Probably a week.  Let's show us this.  Today's special season is coming on ABC.  This is the Convent San Tanco in Puerto Rico.  The gusty trade winds that swirl around are something we sisters have learned to cope with.  But to Sister Betrieal, our new novice from America, these lively breezes came as a bit of a shock.  However, Sister Betrieal was as much of a shock to some of us.  She was 90 pounds of young ideas.  90 pounds of young ideas. 
[00:50:00]  She immediately set out to solve some of our problems.  What a dumb wardrobe.  She was pretty fucking cute back then, huh?  Until one day, she displayed the most remarkable talent of all.  Good grief!  She's flying.  The men lifts me up like this, you see.  Now, if you go on, I just go...  Yeah, that's a shitty clip.  Why does that fucking hat blow off?  It's a shitty clip.  Wouldn't you think her hat would blow off?  She'd need it fucking riveted to her head.  Of course.  It's such a dumb concept.  Would she get strangled?  Aerodynamically, she just wouldn't fly.  No! 
[00:50:30]  But the show did very well for ABC.  Oh, did it?  Is there a better clip?  Yeah, you picked a horrid clip, Sam Roberts.  The show's not that old.  All right, what's this one?  All right.  101, The Flying Nun, this is called.  San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico.  Looks nice.  Convent Santanco.  And this is the Convent Santanco.  Santanco.  High on a cliff in old San Juan, overlooking the Caribbean.  Why don't we get fat nuns for this place?  Whoever calls Chicago the windy city just hadn't been to San Juan. 
[00:51:00]  Wow, it's windy there.  This is the Reverend Mother Placido.  Now, you may be wondering why the wind doesn't blow in her office.  She's a good?  The answer is very simple.  The Reverend Mother just wouldn't allow it.  Oh, she's a...  She is.  Hand laughter.  One day, a few months ago, Sister Sisto and I were instructed to meet a young novice  who was arriving that day by steamer from New York to teach kindergarten.  By steamer? 
[00:51:30]  Steamer.  Dingamajig, a real belt, sister.  And I did.  This is the whole episode.  We can't watch the flying nun.  But the laughs are coming in for no reason.  Yeah, listen.  I'm putting your dictionary of American slang against her.  When I go teach in USA, I really know my way around.  I got it made.  That doesn't make any sense.  Who laughs at that?  Who laughs?  I'm afraid not.  Hold on to your coronet, Sister Sisto.  We're going to have to walk.  It's a coronet? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  It's called a coronet.  Din, din, din, din, din, din.  No, your coronet is your asshole.  Hold on to your asshole, sister.  We didn't reach the dock in time for Sister Bertrover.  We can't do this.  It's a wonderful show.  It's very windy, and she flies, and it's a coronet.  And it's a 45-minute clip.  So the show used to be an hour?  Was it?  Maybe this is the pilot.  Ah, pilot.  Yeah, whatever.  Oh, is that Carlos?  That is Carlos.  Yeah.  Whoa, what is she doing? 
[00:52:30]  Why is she looking all up?  Oh, that's Carlos and one of his ladies.  Oh, that looks like Marlo Thomas.  He's, you know, it's going to be tough to, you know, bang one of the nuns, so he's got  to get rid of some of that fucking poison.  Some of the fucking Latin lover poison.  In between trying to, you know, bang a nun.  Yeah.  Knocking back a few with the easy ones.  Carlos was like a party guy, was he?  He was a little shady or something, but he was always helping.  The convent suntan.  I don't remember any of this. 
[00:53:00]  He was an addict.  I remember she flew around and I thought it was some dumb fucking magical powers that  they didn't really want to, like, talk about.  No powers.  No powers whatsoever.  Yeah.  I've never seen The Flying Nun.  I mean, I know who she is, but I've never watched this fucking show.  I'm not missing anything.  That's for sure.  83 episodes aired.  It was three seasons.  Yep.  Child of the 80s.  What years?  I'm going to guess late 60s.  Hold on.  67 to 70.  67.  1967. 
[00:53:30]  They did a lot of reruns, Sam, when we were going.  Star Trek, the original series, was still in production.  Yeah.  They did a lot of fucking reruns.  Talking about Nick at Night?  Yep.  We had a lot of channels growing up and they threw some of this shit on those other channels.  Reruns were all I watched as a kid.  That was it.  All these bad shows from the 60s.  When you were a kid, you were like Michael J. Fox when you go, what's a rerun?  It's a rerun.  You know, because she was in Gidget first. 
[00:54:00]  Yes, girl.  Midget.  Gidget.  Is that what it was?  Yeah, that's what they called her.  It was canceled and she got off at the flying night.  She refused it at first.  She didn't want to do it.  She did.  And then her stepfather said she might not work again in show business if she didn't  accept it.  So it scared her into accepting it and as a result, the people who were making this,  they were called Screen Gems, they fired their second choice who had already started shooting  the pilot.  So it said Sally recalled hanging from a crane and being humiliated by a parade of episodic  TV directors.  One of whom actually grabbed her shoulders and moved her in a position is if she were 
[00:54:30]  a prop.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I'm sure the special effects department for the flying nun wasn't like it is now with  like the fly wires that they put people in, the harnesses.  It was probably just a crane with a fucking thing strapped on her.  They just lifted her up a little bit, threw her around a bit, swung her around.  In front of a moving screen, you know, in front of a screen with a movie playing on it. 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  She was pregnant during the second season.  Ew.  So they had to, I wish we could find something from the second season.  Abort?  Yeah, she had an abortion.  No, they...  She went to Carlos with his hanger.  And they tied in the bad lieutenant with it.  No, they had to block her with props in season two.  It was a logistical nightmare because she was supposed to be religious.  Celibate, the producer solved the problem by using props and scenery to block Viewer 
[00:55:30]  Fields' body below her chest.  And long shots of her stunt double for the flying sequence.  God, oh my, the whole second season, they had to shoot around her being knocked up.  No, we might have to look at a few episodes later.  Yeah, I think we should just watch the whole series.  There she is, Harry Ackerman, executive producer.  She was flying right there.  That looked like she was above Puerto Rico.  Oh, yeah, just like it.  Mm-hmm.  There she is with that little thing, that rag on her head.  That makes her look a lot softer and sexier. 
[00:56:00]  Definitely sexy.  Yeah, yeah.  How'd they shoot around her being pregnant?  Is she pregnant right there?  I don't know.  Is that season two?  Well, I mean, in the first trimester, they barely show.  You know, and then she's got the robes and stuff.  You can hide some shit.  Pregnant none.  And she's holding her hands in a basket in front of her stomach.  Right, so that could be all this.  Do you think this is what they're doing?  Using props?  I believe so.  All right.  A little shot.  Yeah, she looks a little pregnant there.  Do her tits look full?  She's holding...  She's, like, constantly holding a basket in front of her. 
[00:56:30]  Do her tits look achy?  Are they engorged?  With nourishment?  Ah, shit.  Does she have that breast ache?  Because they're filling up with milk.  Who's the Pete Best of fucking The Flying Nun that got replaced?  I don't know.  Ron something.  Ronnie something her name was.  Spectre.  Ronnie Spectre.  Wow.  I want to see that movie fucking with Helen Mirren and Pacino. 
[00:57:00]  That'd be good.  Yeah.  I'll tell you her name in a second.  It was...  Well, hurry up.  Because we've got to eat.  Yeah.  What happened to her?  Did she go on?  Ronnie Troop.  Did she go...  How is Troop spelt?  T-R-O-U-P.  Look up Ronnie Troop.  I'm looking at her career right now.  And see what she has done.  Oh, boy.  She started as an extra in 64.  She appeared in some My Three Sons.  Classroom scenes.  Uncredited extra in Gidget. 
[00:57:30]  Oh.  And she made a film debut as part of an all-girl ensemble in The Trouble with Angels.  Oh, yes.  Prominent in the graduation scene.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  She was in perhaps an episode of Adam 12.  Really?  She was...  Yeah.  Her big break.  When she was 22, she was cast as Sister Betrieal.  Oh, what happened?  It said that something along the line that Sally Field creatively kicked her in the cunt.  And she then went on to do Danger Island. 
[00:58:00]  And oh, boy.  We see a picture of her.  Family Affair, 1970.  Family Affair.  Oh, really?  She was on Emergency, Marcus Welby, SWAT, Adam 12.  All those 70s dramas.  Everybody was on.  She got around after that.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I think I recognize this broad.  I recognize this broad, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was on just a bunch of things.  Yeah, she's kind of a cute little 70s-looking bitch there.  Right.  What happened?  Dead?  No.  Oh.  It said in 2010, she appeared with her My Three Sons co-stars at the 50th anniversary celebration in Beverly Hills. 
[00:58:30]  And Stanley Livingston, who played her husband, Chip Douglas, on the series, had not seen her since 1977.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  She was the really cute one that was married to the, yeah, one of the My Three Sons guys.  I actually, yeah, look.  Yeah.  That's her.  Go right there.  No, down.  Down.  One more row.  Oh, boy.  Two over.  Two over.  No.  Over.  Oh, up.  Up.  Up what?  Right there.  Click that.  You'll remember her.  Oh, yeah.  I definitely remember her.  She was on Cold Case. 
[00:59:00]  She was on, like, a guest starring in the West Wing.  Like, she...  Yeah.  That fucking wrecked her career.  Her career, it's done.  That wrecked her career.  Poor woman.  I bet she hates Sally Field.  Oh, yeah.  Every time she read the inquiry that Burt was fucking tuning her up, she was probably happy.  Oh, yeah.  Sally Field goes on to win Oscars and fucking, you know, huge movies.  Yeah, Lincoln.  I tried, man.  That movie's fucking slow.  Dude, right?  Are you kidding me?  Isn't it?  Are you kidding me?  I don't have time for that.  Sally Field's nominated for an Oscar and she's playing rape victim number six in Cold Case. 
[00:59:30]  Your face is not going to be in this one.  You're going to have your head in a toilet and a hammer claw in the back of your head.  Lincoln is incredibly slow.  And then you know that they don't even have the payoff.  No, no.  The assassination.  You're like, what the fuck?  I'm not going to invest in this movie.  It's a lot of oldie time talk.  Dude, it was so slow.  That was the first five minutes.  Yeah.  And I turned it off. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, it's just slow motion.  I will not be watching all of Lincoln.  That's for sure.  No.  All right.  We're going to break.  What do we got?  We got some stuff.  We definitely got stuff to talk about.  Stuff.  Yes.  Stay tuned for stuff.  For some patients, the ability to communicate is not an option. 
[01:00:30]  The lookover would be like some 80-year-old woman with her legs spread.  But one man is about to change their lives forever.  Did someone say something?  For the terminally ill who live in darkness.  What the fuck is that? 
[01:01:00]  Dr. Anthony Cumia.  Who said that?  Has found a way to bring light to the remaining days on Earth.  Your ass talked to me.  Using a rare gift he never knew he had.  Oh my God, what have I done?  He'll learn to love those he never knew existed.  I think I know what you're going for.  You're going for sexy.  You're coming off as whiny.  ONA Pictures.  What a hot voice that is.  And Depends Undergarments.  I love it.  Present a true story.  You're an ass.  Of one man's inability to distinguish a voice from a fart. 
[01:01:30]  You're talking out your ass.  The Ass Whisperer.  Coming soon.  Oh, stop it.  To the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, the Pope wears a pointy white hat.  Doodly-doo.  Oh, I like that.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope speaks Latin.  Doodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  And the Pope doesn't use the very language. 
[01:02:00]  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope enjoys the view from the balcony.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope apologized for the church.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope, when he apologized, his fingers were crossed.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo. 
[01:02:30]  The Pope was overheard motherfucking AT&T service.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  He said this iPhone's a piece of shit and threw it off the balcony.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope really digs Mel Gibson's movies.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Let me say hi to Steve in Connecticut.  Steve.  Yes!  Hello!  I'm in Connecticut, see T. 
[01:03:00]  Cock teased.  Oh, the Pope finds Steve C.'s lifestyle abhorrent.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope wants Satan to smite Steve C.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope thinks Larry King is an irrelevant ass.  Toodly-doo.  Larry!  Hey!  Oh, how important is the hoodly-doo?  Toodly-doo. 
[01:03:30]  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Coming this fall, Daytime TV is back with a bite.  Hell yeah.  Spend your weekday afternoons laughing, loving, and learning with Mike.  I'm not going to say anything about the vagina.  Heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, leaves the ring behind and hosts his own  daytime TV show, giving dating advice.  That's how it is.  Day by note, you stick with your ex, even though you break up, until you find somebody 
[01:04:00]  whose sex is better or just as good.  Sharing personal experiences.  Don Keenan, give me my badim.  I couldn't eat, motherfucker.  I'm going to beat you a grown man.  I ain't eat, motherfucker.  Fuck you, nigga.  And getting a little rowdy with the studio audience.  Fuck you!  Fucking do it!  Yeah!  Mike lets the audience in on his more reserved, well-read side.  Yes, sir.  My diction's too precarious for your comprehension.  I will endeavor to exclaminate more profoundly and say, yes, ma'am.  But he isn't afraid to let loose now and then, too.  Booga, booga, booga! 
[01:04:30]  Booga, booga!  Weekday afternoons this fall.  It's Mike.  Woo!  Hosted by Mike Tyson.  What do you say, champ?  What?  Look!  It's not the same like it was.  Erectile dysfunction has become a serious epidemic.  Pussy is over.  Don't mean nothing no more.  I can't get a heart on.  Take it from legendary comedian and ED sufferer, Pat Cooper.  It's no joke.  I'm not making this shit up.  You're with that gorgeous muffa.  And you're in bed and it don't happen. 
[01:05:00]  Happened to me.  And she goes, what's the matter?  I said, I think it's erectional dysfunction.  She goes, what's that?  I'm fucking dead.  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option.  I tried Cialis.  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction,  contact your physician to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist.  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big thrill is peeing. 
[01:05:30]  I said, when I was getting laid, I said, go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah.  It's the same fucking thing.  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper.  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction hype.  Fuck all the bullshit.  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  Serious, serious accents.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:06:00]  I'm going to go Black Sabbath.  Yeah, but if this is in celebration of the album of 13 coming out June 11th,  I'm going to bite Iraq's cheek.  Right, because this is Ronnie James.  Yeah.  It's an amazing song. 
[01:06:30]  No, I told D-Rock, though, it's Pope Day.  So this might have to have something to do with the Pope.  Okay, maybe.  D-Rock?  D-Rock Combat?  Yep, it's part of the Pope.  See?  Okay.  We officially made it Pope Day.  I'm sorry, Jim Norton.  No, no, fair enough.  So, uh, D-Rock will be playing some Pope songs for us on the way back into the show.  Turn this up a little bit.  I love his fucking voice.  Oh, yeah.  D-Rock's voice was great.  It's heaven and hell.  Hell no!  Yeah! 
[01:07:00]  The lover of life's not a sinner.  Jeez.  That's a distinctive voice.  He was like 45 when he sang this.  Really?  Yeah.  Man.  And, yeah, like Jimmy was saying, you got the new Black Sabbath record coming out on  June 11th. 
[01:07:30]  And they, uh...  What do you think?  Do you think it's going to be all right?  The two songs I heard were fucking unbelievable, and I have faith with Rick Rubin producing.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Sorry.  I was going to interrupt you.  Because I know you're a super fan, so I was wondering if you're just biased.  No, I am.  I'm sure.  Sure.  But, I mean, I did actually genuinely like it, and I was happy to like it.  But, uh, I saw the little clip they sent out of just Rick Rubin talking, and they show  the guys jamming a little bit, and then Ozzy has the greatest hat that anyone's ever  had.  Is it kind of a Pope hat?  No, it's like a bowler. 
[01:08:00]  A bowler, how do they call him?  A bowler, yeah.  Yeah, he's wearing a bowler hat and a fucking...  It's just the greatest little round derby hat ever.  Adorable.  So, I can't wait for it.  I cannot wait.  Should be good.  I hope so, man.  Should be good.  Um, yes.  I pre-ordered.  We have a quick thing I want to address here is our little problem we have in New York  City with, um, with, uh, a couple of police officers shot some, uh, 16-year-old, um, thug  in Brooklyn. 
[01:08:30]  Uh, apparently he was walking down the street, or hanging out with another group of people,  and they were acting suspiciously.  So these cops came over, and this kid, uh, runs, and they, uh, give chase.  He reaches into his waistband, uh, pulls out a .38, turns around and points at the cops.  The cops unload on the guy, and, uh, kill him.  And now there's a fucking, uh, night after night, there's these protests, which are actually  riots, going on in Brooklyn in support of this, uh, thug, and, uh, against the cops. 
[01:09:00]  A cop last night got hit in the face with a brick, uh, during one of these, um, great,  uh, um, supportive protests.  It just, I just want to say, like, when, when you get these problems in the black community,  uh, everyone says, well, what do we do?  How do we help?  What could, what could be done about the violence that takes place, and the gang violence,  and that, uh, uh, more black leaders got to speak out and do things. 
[01:09:30]  Like, you can't ask for a solution, and ask for the police to do more, because it's always,  oh, another child got shot, where were the police when this happened?  Why don't they, you can't ask for that, on one hand, and then support a thug that was  shot when he's pointing a gun at the cops, uh, in the next.  You just can't do it.  It's not going to solve any problems.  You look retarded doing it, and it's, uh, hypocritical and extremely counterproductive 
[01:10:00]  to trying to solve the problem that is literally plaguing your people and your, your communities.  Black on black violence, um, gang violence, uh, uh, uh, just shooting each other.  Uh, and now this cop, uh, these two cops shoot this, uh, teen, 16, they try to portray him  like a nice, good kid.  He was a fucking thug with gang affiliations.  He was in fucking, uh, gang.  There's videos of him on YouTube, uh, smacking some other kid in the face, a gang member 
[01:10:30]  in the face.  Uh, so you can't do that, and on the other hand, uh, say that you want, uh, this problem  fixed, and this problem of gang violence must be addressed, and that, you look stupid.  So, uh, leave the cops alone.  A deadly police shooting in Brooklyn turned violent once again.  This time, close to 50 people were arrested, including the sister of the armed teenager who  was killed.  So, eyewitness news reporter Lisa Calagrossi is live in East Flatbush with the details.  Good morning, Lisa.  Good morning, Ken.  And the parents of Kamani Gray did not speak at the rally last night, as expected, where 
[01:11:00]  200 protesters took to the streets.  It's the third demonstration since the teenager was shot Saturday night.  Murder, murder, murder, murder.  The police killing of teenager Kamani Gray brought a third night of protest in the streets of  East Flatbush.  They're killing us all, right?  Protesters squared up with police throwing bricks and bottles.  No, you're killing each other.  Police arrested at least 50 people, including the sister of Kamani Gray.  Others were pepper sprayed or forced back with batons by officers in riot gear. 
[01:11:30]  Once again, it was a case of angry splinter groups breaking off from a planned peaceful vigil  for the 16-year-old.  Don't put your hands on me, son.  Don't put your hands on me, son.  Suspicions of angry growing stronger after the city medical examiner reported that Gray  was hit by seven bullets, three of them to the back.  It's not clear which way Gray was facing when the first bullets hit him.  City Councilman Jumaane Williams, a critic of police, was openly angry at outside groups.  He said, we're trying to escalate tensions.  You can't ask us to trust the police and what they say happen when there's a pattern in practice 
[01:12:00]  that must...  Pattern in practice is the pattern of you killing each other.  Stop it.  If you weigh the deaths of young black men by police against the deaths of young black men  by other young black men, it's fucking minute, a fraction.  So don't protest about the cops killing.  They're killing us all.  They're killing us all.  No!  You're killing each other, dummies!  How about...  That would be interesting to see if this protest was as angry at the gang violence. 
[01:12:30]  Like, if you saw this kind of a crazy protest against drug dealers who are ruining neighborhoods  or gangs that are killing people, that would be an interesting protest.  Right.  And it's hard to feel empathy for a guy that had a fucking pistol.  If you have a pistol and you pull it out and the cops shoot you, what do you expect?  Exactly.  I don't understand where this protest anger is coming from.  I just don't understand it.  It's exclusive to the black community that no matter what happens when the police are involved, 
[01:13:00]  even if it's a case where a gun is being pointed at them, that they will chant murder.  There seems to be this, we could address this in any way we want.  And we want to address it as the police, again, an injustice.  You can't keep crying injustice when this was what appears to be justified. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, right.  Fuck.  It's out of hand.  It's like, fucking, there's no light at the end of the tunnel here.  You just can't see, like, that things are progressing when you see shit like this.  You can't say, well, maybe a couple of years down the line,  we're going to get a little more assimilation into society.  And there won't be this great divide between black and white as there is,  especially in circumstances like this.  Your gang violence is, you're killing each other. 
[01:14:00]  Black people are killing other black people.  That's your problem.  Not the police, not whitey, not fucking civil rights violations.  You're killing each other.  So fix it.  Why did the kid have a gun, the 16-year-old?  Why?  I don't know.  Why are they blowing off that fact in that neighborhood?  Because it doesn't fit the mold of what they want.  They want a poor 16-year-old child who has probably had his whole life, 
[01:14:30]  a productive life in front of him, mowed down by the police.  That's the story.  Not a thug gang member pulling a gun on the cops  and getting exactly what he deserved.  And how did a 16-year-old get a gun permit?  You know what?  He must have gone through a lot of work, a lot of money,  to get that permit to legally carry that gun.  He got what he deserved. 
[01:15:00]  A fucking thug.  Why do they throw the logic right out the window?  Because...  I can't imagine being a 16-year-old kid running around with a gun.  That is the difference.  That is that black, urban mindset.  It's bizarre.  It doesn't make sense.  Just kind of...  Yeah, like just reacting.  Like kind of hearing the facts,  but then just automatically reacting in one direction. 
[01:15:30]  I can't understand how anybody could do that.  Hey!  Come on now!  I back it up with facts!  Oh, and on a side note,  by the way,  George Zimmerman,  mark my words right here,  will absolutely be acquitted.  He will absolutely be acquitted.  And that will be a huge problem.  That trial kicks up in, I think, July?  Something like that.  But yeah, he will be acquitted.  It was obvious from everything I've read, 
[01:16:00]  and I've pawed through the facts of that.  It was a completely justified shooting.  And stand your ground doesn't even apply in the case.  It's just a case of self-defense.  That's it.  Some people are saying this kid didn't have a gun?  No.  A couple of witnesses in the area.  I'm just asking, because that's coming in.  And whatever they're witnessing is still up for grabs,  said, oh, he didn't have a gun.  He had a fucking gun.  Two cops had the...  Oh, we back in the 70s, 
[01:16:30]  where they put a little throw-down weapon next to him?  Oh, look at that!  Shit doesn't happen anymore.  There's cameras everywhere.  And he wasn't arrested prior to this ever, right?  No, quite the record.  I've just said no.  Quite the record, yeah.  I heard five times prior?  Five times prior for...  Six-year-old kid arrested five times?  Of course.  Of course.  Wow, I used to do a little shoplifting every once in a while.  Oh, my God, at 16.  He had a fucking gun.  He pointed at the cops.  The cops fucking lit him up.  Good. 
[01:17:00]  One less fucking problem.  Because that kid would have amounted to nothing more  than a fucking burden on society.  Goodbye!  Goodbye!  Thank you.  Well, the family's sad, though, Anthony.  Fucking get a grip on reality.  Stop with your fantasy world like this kid was a fucking good kid.  He was a good kid.  Really?  How about that video where he's smacking another kid in the face  and taking his fucking necklace off  because it was the color of an opposing gang 
[01:17:30]  and slapping him and laughing  and throwing up more fucking gang signs.  He looked like my arthritic grandmother, his hands.  There was a little levity in there.  A little bit.  He's doing all kinds of gang signs.  A little bit.  I just can't fucking, uh, uh, I can't understand.  And the frustration that I am voicing  comes from the fact that when shit like this happens,  everything gets set back further.  Where we're never going to get  what we need to get done in this country 
[01:18:00]  because of this huge divide  between black and white.  It's crazy.  We're not fucking living peacefully together.  We're not.  Sorry.  It's a fucking illusion  perpetrated by,  by the, the media.  An illusion!  Thank you.  All we are saying  But in more important news, 
[01:18:30]  Fandango!  Fandango!  Fandango!  Why is Sam laughing now?  Why would Eric have Fandango's music  ready to be played that quickly?  In a second.  Because he can't find anything.  A, he loves wrestling,  and B, he knows we're going to go to it.  I'm on E-Rock's side today.  Well.  Well.  What happened here?  Well.  I got a tweet from Fandango. 
[01:19:00]  Now, why is Fandango  tweeting you?  Well, because he knows I'm a big fan.  Oh.  I guess I've expressed the fact  that I'm a big fan.  Yes.  But I thought you did as well.  I thought I did.  I said it was hilarious.  I brought this to the show, though.  Because of Sam Roberts' tweet,  I went and checked out some wrestling,  and I saw this fucking wacky storyline,  and I hated it at first,  but now I'm all in.  Uh, WWE Fandango. 
[01:19:30]  Fandango.  That's how it's pronounced.  Oh, no.  Fandango.  If someone calls him that,  he's not going to wrestle.  Well, how am I going to get  his Twitter plug out there?  I don't know.  No one knows how to spell  Fandango.  It's Fandango.  F-A-N-D-A-N-G-O.  WWE Fandango on Twitter.  Yeah.  Uh, out of nowhere,  my fucking Twitter exploded,  so I knew something was up.  Oh, sounds dangerous. 
[01:20:00]  And I looked at my, uh,  my, my tweets there,  and I see, uh,  Fandango writes,  Opie Radio.  Heard you got a case  of the Fandangos.  And a lot of O's in it.  Oh, yeah.  It's okay.  I'm money, baby.  And then he hashtags it,  Aunt B.  Ah, because of the Opie thing.  With the Opie joke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cute.  So I wrote,  It's O-P-RA-D-O  to you, sir.  Say it right.  I did.  Yeah, exactly.  He has to say it right. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, if you wanted to say  my name properly,  it's two, four,  I made this up on the,  on the go,  so now it's got to be official.  Six O's.  Then you've got to spell out  P, P-E-E.  Oh, right.  Then you go Ray  in capital letters.  Uh-huh.  And then, uh,  you go with, uh,  five D's, I decided.  Ray, did, did, did,  wait, wait, wait.  Ray D-O.  Oh, I went one D  and a lot of E's.  Oh, you would've?  Yeah, because it's almost like  Ray, it's almost like  Ray D-D-D-D-D-D-O.  Really? 
[01:21:00]  And then one O.  Wow.  You've got to end it quick.  Ray D-O.  Hmm.  So.  Well, that's pretty good.  That's, he's a big star  these days, right?  It's exciting.  He's getting some heat.  He's getting heat.  It's rarer I get  a celebrity tweet,  so that was kind of exciting.  No, I'm okay.  Jealous?  I'm happy that this is spreading.  I also get, uh,  I also get the, uh,  the growing pains broad.  She used to tweet me.  What?  Yeah.  Who was that?  The old play, uh,  the old playmate.  Oh, right, okay.  That's not dumb. 
[01:21:30]  I think that's the only  other celebrity tweeter  that I see tweets from.  And I guess Donald Trump Jr.  Yeah.  And, uh,  I think that's about it for me.  I'm trying to thank  anybody else lately.  Uh, well, he.  Oh, Piers Morgan.  Um.  Back and forth a little bit.  Yeah.  Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack.  A little bit.  Jay Moore's.  Nah, Jay Moore unfollowed me  because I didn't do his podcast  first.  Ooh.  Even though I explained it to him  and I still love Jay Moore.  He.  Um.  He's not unfollowed me.  That was, uh,  that was very hurtful.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  He unfollows everybody.  I know.  But, you know,  I'm taking it personally.  You're emotional, that's all.  Very emotional.  Yeah.  Taking it very personally.  I'm trying to.  What happened was I went to,  I went to L.A.  with no intentions  of doing anyone's podcast.  Uh-huh.  I have an open invite  for Jay Moore's,  Kevin Pollack,  and Joe Rogan,  possibly a couple others in there.  Sure.  But those are all three biggies.  I go to L.A.  to do the thing for TBS,  which is coming out in April,  by the way.  Who Gets the Last Laugh?  I'm excited about it. 
[01:22:30]  And as I'm out there,  the fans tweeted Rogan,  said,  Yo, Ope's out there.  You should get him on the podcast.  So Rogan.  Johnny on the spot.  Rogan texts me and goes,  Hey, I hear you in L.A.  You want to do my podcast?  I got an open spot tomorrow.  It just so happens.  Nice.  What, am I going to say no  at that point?  I'm like, yes.  So you fucked Jay Moore over,  and then what happened?  Well, then he got mad.  He goes,  I can't believe you did his podcast  before mine.  And I wasn't overthinking  overthinking anything.  Podcast wars now, Opie. 
[01:23:00]  Remember radio wars?  I know.  We can laugh at the podcast wars  because we went through it  with radio,  and it just seems very silly  to have podcast wars.  I wouldn't purposely...  wars with himself  over which of the four podcasts  someone goes on first.  He gets mad.  Iraq, does the Simpsons show  get mad that the  Growing Up With E-Rock show  has a guest on?  Very good.  And does it yell  at the Growing Up With E-Rock show?  Very good question.  I've banned myself.  You've banned, yes.  Well, you should be.  I wouldn't lap band. 
[01:23:30]  For the record,  I would never...  I would never purposely  hurt Jay Moore.  We go way the fuck back  to the early days  of any W's  when we met.  He knows that.  He knows.  But if Rogan,  you know,  gives me a text  that you're,  hey, you're out in L.A.,  I got a spot for a podcast  more.  You want to do it?  Of course I'm going to do it.  When's the next time  I'm going to be in L.A.?  It's not playing favorites.  It's just, you know,  we're very good friends  with both of those gentlemen.  I went out to L.A.  for one thing 
[01:24:00]  just to, like,  get my shit together  for that TV thing.  And I wasn't planning  on anything else.  I didn't even leave  my hotel room.  And fucking Joe Rogan  offers you some fucking pot  when you're doing that.  It's not like...  Jay Moore  offers you some NyQuil.  He did.  A couple of shots.  Yeah, I took a baby hit.  Exactly.  Joe Rogan got me back in.  He dragged me back in.  Did you get high off it?  I don't know.  I think I did, yeah.  Why don't you...  You should just smoke  your brains out one day.  Oh, man.  One day.  Like, you're there  and you're going to do it.  Just smoke your fucking brains out.  Well, I don't know.  I was kind of intimidated  doing the Rogan thing 
[01:24:30]  and he was like,  come on, man.  So I purposely did a baby hit  because I wanted to, like...  You didn't want to be  completely out of your mind?  No.  Fuck no.  Imagine you listen back  and it's like,  oh, my God,  I'm fucking talking about nonsense.  You're all loopy and shit.  I think I would have done  a couple of strong hits  if we weren't doing the podcast.  Yeah.  I think I was ready.  I haven't done it since,  by the way,  because people are asking.  The weed.  The wacky tobacco.  That's the difference between us.  You take a nice puff  and you have a good time.  I can't comprehend that.  You can't do that.  Ah, I'd be full steam ahead. 
[01:25:00]  Any type of...  That's all it would take, huh?  I'd be running out  in between breaks.  Every break,  I'd be coming back  and fucking...  Really?  ...dumber and dumber looking.  Yeah.  Just all fucking stoned.  Yes.  I absolutely will...  Weird thing to have happen.  I absolutely will do  a little more,  but I mean,  I'm not thinking about it, really.  If the time's right,  I'll do, you know,  I'll get high.  Yes.  Yeah, why not?  I don't like the buzz anymore.  I never...  And thinking back,  I never really did.  It was very paranoia-inducing  and very anxiety-inducing to me.  I would do it,  and if I was having a good time  and a lot of people were around 
[01:25:30]  and it was a party atmosphere,  then it was fine.  Right.  But any other time,  like just smoking,  like my brother could just sit there  years ago  and just smoke  fucking joint after joint  all day.  It was like part of his fucking life.  How?  I don't know,  but he used to.  Now he fucking...  I think he took a hit recently.  We were playing poker at my house.  He took a hit recently,  and five minutes later,  everyone's going,  where's Joe?  Where the fuck is Joe?  He went up,  went into bed,  and just fucking crashed.  No kidding.  Went to sleep. 
[01:26:00]  He goes,  I just can't fucking smoke  that shit anymore.  Wow.  Yeah.  No, I would never just sit there  and do hit after hit.  No fucking way.  Dude, back in the day,  he would smoke.  And I would too.  I mean,  I was stoned a lot,  but I never really liked the buzz.  I did a couple little pot circles  and you just keep passing around  slowly as you're talking,  and that's crazy.  That's crazy.  I'm sorry.  Rogan's an anomaly  that he can get shit done.  Yes.  He works when he smokes pot,  whereas I fucking creatively, 
[01:26:30]  I'm dead.  Done, right?  Nothing.  Joe works.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck you do that.  I have no clue.  How do you take the jujitsu high?  As paranoid as it makes you,  it's like you think  everybody wants to hit you  and they do?  How does it fucking mind?  Yeah, yeah.  I do like me some wine, though.  I'll tell you that much.  You like a crashing down drunk feeling.  I like the one that's hot.  I like a mellow wine buzz.  It's great.  Gives you a little bit of a hangover,  so it's not that good  the next day, but... 
[01:27:00]  I've moved from the wine  going back to beer, really.  Yeah.  When I do drink, yeah.  When I drink.  But I don't even really...  I mean,  three beers tops, maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it for me.  That's a good start.  Really?  Or a half a bottle of wine  every once in a while,  but that's it.  More than that, no.  If I start at like,  let's say, 5 p.m.  with a bottle of wine,  I could have the entire bottle  last till maybe 5.30. 
[01:27:30]  No, still...  Like till 11 at night.  Just sitting there,  sipping a little wine,  doing whatever.  And then it's fine.  But if I overextend  and that bottle is done by 9,  and then I crack another one,  and I'm like,  yeah,  then I will fucking feel like  dog shit the next day.  Yeah, those wine hangovers.  Oh, they are the worst.  I don't miss that.  Yeah.  God, I know on planes  how sick I'd get.  I never did it.  Really?  I never flew drunk,  but I know I'd get very,  very sick if I did.  I would have been nervous 
[01:28:00]  going to L.A.  Oh, no.  And then I would have fucking,  I would have fucking  had a couple of drinks  with Nicolas Cage.  Could you imagine  if Jimmy was drunk  next to Nicolas Cage?  Would have been the worst trip  Nicolas Cage ever had in his life.  Hey.  We should fucking  just do a movie together, man.  I'm fucking good.  And would you really?  Yeah, you would, right?  You would?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  But that would, yeah.  But you would be  breaking his, like,  his personal space, Jimmy.  I don't want to be alive anymore. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Miss, can I have another seat?  Oh, my God.  I just, no,  I don't want to talk.  I'm just sick.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to talk?  Oh, fine.  Look, it's cold,  but can I just,  I just want to sleep.  Anything worse  than the drunk fun?  Oh, you don't want to talk?  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  And then you just start, like,  yeah,  big,  not talking to him,  but just going,  yeah, big Hollywood star here. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, look out.  We're not good enough for him.  When, when,  oh.  When someone gives you  the drunk fine,  you know damn well  it's not fine.  It's not fine at all.  Oh, I spent my entire marriage  getting that fine.  Fine.  Fine, if you don't want to talk.  Oh, so it's fine?  Good.  Then we don't have to argue.  You're a fucking asshole.  Oh, I'm an asshole.  Great, great.  It's fucking 1 a.m.  I have to get up for real work  in the morning  and you're yelling at me  and I can't sleep  and I need to sleep.  That's a woman's thing.  I don't know why, 
[01:29:30]  but they love,  you know,  getting,  fucking late,  getting some stuff done  really late  when they know you're weak  and you just want to crash.  I'll tell you why  because you're stuck there  with them  because they want to  fucking hear themselves talk  and they know  that you're not going  to get out of bed  and leave the apartment  so they know  they have an audience  to yap at.  That's why they all do it.  It's like you want,  it's like you want a guy  that makes money  and I got to get up  in the morning  and you're fucking yelling at me.  Yeah, women love to start  their arguments late.  Oh, fuck.  Just before bed  is a perfect time.  I fucking hated that 
[01:30:00]  more than,  more than anything  was that argument  that I couldn't stop  and I would try  to be so logical.  Yeah, no, look,  can we just,  look, I understand,  but can we wait  and we'll take up  right here tomorrow  because I have to get up  early for work.  Hey, you're a fucking,  go fuck yourself.  This is important stuff.  Really?  Yes, the vacuum cleaner bags  have to be put in the closet  and it's not really 
[01:30:30]  important stuff.  That's why,  I got to be honest with you,  because I know  what people get on you  sometimes.  That's why I've never  got on you  with what you're doing  with your life  because I saw  the other side  and had chores.  It used to amaze me.  Chores.  We would be,  we would be taking over  the radio world  in New York City  and then we'd get syndicated  and I would drop  Anthony home  and she'd be waiting  all pissed off  because he didn't vacuum  before he left the house.  you know what jobs 
[01:31:00]  are yours?  I ask three things  from you  and I'm like  what the fuck  is this?  The vacuuming,  taking out  the fucking garbage  and cleaning  the cat boxes.  Oh gosh.  I saw it first hand.  He is not bullshitting.  And if you can't do that,  shut up,  cunt.  I remember picking you up on, 
[01:31:30]  what road did you live on?  I passed your house a lot.  High Street.  High Street.  I passed it on the way  to FH Riley's.  I cut down that way  to get to my bro's restaurant  on New York Avenue.  And I remember picking you up  and I lived just across Main Street.  We were maybe a half mile  away from each other  and we'd come in pretty early,  10 o'clock,  10.30,  we'd start a commute,  right?  Yep.  And so many times  I would pick Anthony up  and there would be an argument  going on on the stoop  and I'm like, 
[01:32:00]  he would get in the car  and I remember so many times  going,  what could you have possibly done?  Because I know  you just woke up.  Right.  I know you just woke up.  You haven't even been up enough  to have problems.  And that's why you left  early back in the day.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because we had our studio,  our office set up nice.  Of course we'd want to hang out there.  Like camp.  It was great.  And then fucking...  I think we left at 10.30 every day  and we got in around noon 
[01:32:30]  and the show didn't start  until three.  It was great.  We'd fucking hang out.  I'd play video games.  I'd fucking just hang out.  It was great.  And then...  And then we'd go home  and have fucking...  Where are you?  You know what?  I think I'm going to get a...  Hope's got a cell phone  and it's really...  I'll never forget it.  It comes in really handy.  You're not getting  a fucking cell phone.  I was the cause of one  of their big fights  because I had a cell phone.  And I was late  to the cell phone game.  Why ain't I getting a cell phone? 
[01:33:00]  Why can't I?  I'm a fucking grown man.  I bring in all the money  and I...  He said you're not  getting a cell phone.  Yeah, she wouldn't let me  get a cell phone.  He was 30...  35 or something.  At the time.  I'm like...  But I go...  Everyone has a cell phone now  and I want a cell phone.  I go...  What if you...  I go...  For anything...  I go...  What about, you know,  emergency in the car?  I go...  Then you can get  a car phone.  She wanted me to get  one of those  that are hardwired  into the car  with the little  pigtail antenna.  And, you know... 
[01:33:30]  And we kind of  needed the cell phones.  At that point, yeah.  You're fucking communicating.  We went up to Boston  in 95.  I still didn't have  a cell phone yet.  No.  And probably...  96, maybe?  I didn't have one  until 2000.  No.  Or actually, 99.  99.  You didn't even have one  when we went to NEW?  Uh-uh.  I didn't get a cell phone.  Because that was 98.  I didn't get a cell phone  until I fucking left  the wife.  Wow.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  Because why would I do  something that would  make even more arguments  instead of just going,  Okay!  Right.  I won't do that!  So maybe she'll stop...  Nah!  Oh, there's something else.  When were regular Joes  getting cell phones?  62.  I thought I was late  to the game,  and I think I got one  in 90...  I want to call...  I'll call like 96,  maybe even 97.  I think 94, 95.  96.  Is really when it  started exploding.  Those years, it really started.  Yeah.  Where the regular guy  could finally get a cell phone?  Yeah.  Because they were around 
[01:34:30]  before that,  but it was ridiculous  how expensive the whole thing was.  I finally got one  because I had to be able  to get in touch  with my new girlfriend.  So she was right in the end.  She was probably right  to keep me from getting  that cell phone.  She was kind of right  in the end.  I'll tell you that much.  Oh my God,  what a nightmare that was.  Clean the cat box.  By the way,  I'll play you, Rox.  Four cats,  they're all yours,  you fuck.  I didn't want them.  I didn't even want  the fucking cats.  Four of them,  you crazy cat lady.  If you saw her right now,  would you say hi to her?  No. 
[01:35:00]  I was just going to  play you, Rox's part.  We did this bit before.  Oh, of course.  This is one of my  favorite ones.  Oh, of course.  We'll do this another 20 times,  hopefully.  I had had it.  No, what she cost me  just in fucking time,  money, energy,  fucking mentally,  physically,  everything was just,  it was the worst experience  of my life.  Oh, 
[01:35:30]  that disastrous wedding,  that horrid marriage,  that awful divorce.  God,  if I just didn't want to  fucking  stick my dick in her.  Would you be sad  if something bad  happened to her?  Oh, wow.  Honestly?  No.  I wouldn't feel a thing.  I wouldn't feel a thing.  Yeah.  Now you're getting  into that karma shit, man.  No, I wouldn't feel,  I'm not saying,  look, 
[01:36:00]  I don't want anything  bad to happen to anybody.  Believe me.  I'm Mr. Crazy Guilt Guy.  How about she called you  and said,  I'm really sick,  I need money?  Oh, I gave you some.  Where is it?  I gave you plenty.  Use that money.  Go back to your friends  that you gave it to  and ask them to  fucking give it back.  If she had like cancer  or something,  you wouldn't help her?  No.  I wouldn't fucking,  I'd stop giving  to cancer charities  just in case  on the offshoot  it might trickle down on her.  Wow.  No, she's terrible. 
[01:36:30]  I, I, I, I,  I, I, no.  Wow.  No.  If she had breast cancer  or something,  you wouldn't say like.  No.  I love your nose.  No.  No.  I'd fucking,  I'd be happy for the breasts  to get away from her.  She's an awful person.  I never liked her.  I was so infatuated  just with the fucking,  when I first got together  with her,  she had a great body  on her and stuff,  you know?  She, uh,  you know,  eh.  and then just,  oh, God. 
[01:37:00]  Bah!  Bah!  That fucking,  the, the drunken arguments.  Ugh!  I could not stand that.  No.  I wouldn't feel bad.  It'd be like fucking,  be like Butch  in Pulp Fiction  when he fucking  killed that boxer.  Yeah.  And the taxi cab driver  is, you know,  how does it feel?  You know,  eh, how does it feel?  Eh,  I don't feel anything.  Not my problem.  Not my problem. 
[01:37:30]  If I found out,  uh,  there was some hard  fucking circumstance,  eh,  whatever.  Such is life.  Que sera,  sera,  as they say.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah,  that was a wonderful  nine fucking years.  Do you know what  nine years is in a life?  It's a pretty good chunk.  When did you know?  You say your wedding night, right?  I do.  For real?  Uh, yeah.  No, I knew before.  I knew I probably 
[01:38:00]  shouldn't have even gotten married.  I knew that.  Knew it.  But then you're fucking  on that roller coaster.  Why don't,  I was going to say  why do guys,  but I guess both sides do it.  Like, why do you hang in  so long in relationships  that you know are done?  The radio thing  made it easier.  Well.  Because I completely  dove in head first  to the fucking radio gig.  Well, that's why  we certainly related back then  and certainly  became very successful  because we had nothing,  nothing else really.  I didn't want to go  fucking back home.  Jesus. 
[01:38:30]  It was terrible.  My relationship  before my wife  was about eight years  and I would have to,  if I was being honest  with myself,  maybe three out of the eight.  Maybe.  Maybe, right?  And I stayed in there  five years after the fact.  I knew this just is  not going to work out  in the end.  Yeah.  Why do we do that?  I don't know.  Is that our upbringing?  Or is that, like,  more normal than we think?  You put up with this shit.  You're used to people, too.  You're comfortable with them.  Yeah.  You just get comfortable?  And I didn't want to have  to tell my family, like,  oh, yeah, I'm getting divorced. 
[01:39:00]  I didn't have blowouts like you,  but I just knew.  I was like, this is, like,  you know,  because I would talk  about our future, like,  you know, obviously  I wanted to be a dad  and it was obvious  she, like, didn't,  but she kind of...  She didn't want to be a dad?  I mean, she didn't want  to have kids, sorry.  But she would leave  the door open just a little  to make me think  that maybe she would  turn on that  and it was just  all dumb shit.  And I'm like,  what are you doing?  But then we'd go to work  and like, oh,  this is what we're doing.  Yeah, yeah.  Focus, focus, focus, focus.  Holy shit, holy shit.  Ratings are coming in. 
[01:39:30]  We're doing better.  Oh, my God,  they're going to syndicate us.  Then go home and be like,  yeah, whatever.  This is whatever it is.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I could sleep.  I know she's not going to,  you know,  hit me over the head  with a frying pan.  There's no real arguments.  All right, fuck.  Go through the motions there.  Back to work.  Oh, my God.  Focus, focus, focus.  I'd fucking go home,  hop on that computer  and just fucking play  video games for hours on end  until it was time  to go to bed.  Go to bed.  Get off.  Fucking get yelled at  a little.  Go to work.  I remember skiing  in, it might have been 
[01:40:00]  Killington.  If I want to get  a real local.  And I took her  and her friends up there  and we weren't,  you know,  it was obviously like,  she goes,  you don't,  you don't really like me,  do you?  And I never answered  the question.  Woo.  Yeah, that's an answer  right there.  Never answered the question,  but in my stupid head,  I couldn't figure it all out.  Answering.  I couldn't figure out  how to just fucking say,  fuck it.  And what shoes it.  Imagine the fucking tail  we would have got  if we just did the right thing.  Oh, God. 
[01:40:30]  Jesus.  You might have  knocked someone up, though.  Nope.  You got to look back,  like, you might have  right now a tie-in  with a psychopath.  Oh, because, yeah.  You don't know  where your life  would have been.  Yeah, yeah.  Terrible.  You might not have  met your wife,  you might have just  fucking banged  some chick after a gig  and fucking the bag breaks.  Yeah.  And she's a complete kook  and you got a kid with her.  We're twins.  That would suck.  Yeah.  That's why,  thank God,  I never had kids  with the wife. 
[01:41:00]  Are you happy?  Oh, my God.  Imagine having,  first of all,  imagine all my money  would be gone  because she'd fucking  just try to get  all kinds of child support.  Not only having a kid  because, you know,  it's pretty much  a 50-50 thing.  The kid's just like her.  Oh, God.  Imagine it's a, yeah,  a daughter  that's just like her.  Two of them.  Mad Daddy!  You fucking asshole!  Oh, God.  I would wind up doing  what her father did to her. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Fucking take off.  That was it.  Say goodbye to the family.  Goodbye.  New family.  I didn't know  what she looks like.  Ugh.  I think I've seen  a picture of her  once or so,  but I don't know.  Yeah, there was  a picture in the newspaper  of her out by the steps  of the court building  smoking a cigarette  with fucking  $100 bills  raining down on her.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It was fucking  a nightmare.  Oh, you might want  to mention selling  hot dogs in front  of some bar  in Huntington. 
[01:42:00]  Is that what  she's doing now?  I heard that's Joe Curry.  Hi, Joe.  How are you?  He said  somebody saw her  selling hot dogs,  the little hot dog carts  at a bar in front of  a bar in Huntington.  Would you be happy  if that's what she was doing?  Yes.  How'd she go through?  Whatever.  It's not my place.  Oh, my God.  It's so much money.  She went through a lot  of money?  Oh, my God.  It was so much money.  You gotta think.  Oh, my God.  It was so much money.  I don't know anyone  that actually enjoys 
[01:42:30]  selling hot dogs.  Unless they have the business  unless they have the business  and they got one of those  food trucks or whatever.  It's very easy for people  to spend a lot of fucking money  if they aren't even thinking.  It's like, yeah,  I gave her a lot of fucking money,  but she could just spend it,  I guess.  You know?  And I know the crowd,  at least the crowd  that I was with  when I was with her  of people,  and if she was with  the same crowd,  which I heard she was,  they are just like fucking... 
[01:43:00]  Oh, they would have loved her.  You think she paid for everything?  You know,  I could probably use 10 grand.  I'm a little short.  I need to do this.  Hey, here's a business prospect  I got.  All I need is like 20 grand,  and I could do that.  Like, I could just see  that happening.  Boom, boom, boom.  And before you know it,  ah, mustard with that?  Hmm?  A little sauerkraut and mustard?  Mmm.  That's why it's great  to go through life 
[01:43:30]  with no friends.  Don't hit you up.  You know what?  You're exactly right.  Most people don't hit you up.  My good pal Joseph T. Curry  right there on the phone,  he never asked me for a dime.  So that's right.  So give him a taste.  Fuck no.  Do you, um,  do you think that,  uh,  how annoyed would it be  knowing that she was  spending your money?  I can't comprehend that.  It was, uh,  it was,  it was annoying,  but I completely was able  to relate a little more  with the fact that OJ  didn't like watching guys  driving his cars around 
[01:44:00]  with, uh,  Nicole Brown Simpson.  Line one,  it's up to you.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Let's,  let's talk to, uh, Jay.  All right.  We got Jay in Huntington.  Is this the Jay in Huntington  that calls from time to time?  No, no, no, no, no.  All right.  But, um,  my friend comes to,  uh,  a bar I was at in Huntington  and she has this lady with her  and I'm like,  oh, who is this?  And she's like,  oh,  she was tagging along.  I couldn't get rid of her.  She goes,  you know who her ex-husband is  and because I know that  Anthony's ex-wife  was in Huntington,  I was like,  Anthony Cumia. 
[01:44:30]  She's like,  yeah, so,  then her new boyfriend comes,  he shows up  and they start fighting  and he starts yelling at her  because some guy  walked up to him  in a bar and goes,  hey, sorry,  I fucked your girlfriend.  All right.  We don't know.  That's hilarious.  If it's true.  I just want to let you know that.  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know if it's true  or not,  but it sounds pretty funny.  No, it was everyone  only her.  Oh, okay.  What'd she look like?  She's a little short chick  with brunette hair.  That sums it up. 
[01:45:00]  You know what would be really funny  if Anthony went into a jealous rage  and all of a sudden  he hurt she had a new boyfriend  and he went crazy?  God damn it!  Oh.  I just thought you'd think  that was funny.  All right.  Well, you're right.  All right.  There you go.  Just arguing.  Yeah.  You can hang up.  All right.  There we go.  Yeah, just arguing.  God.  That could be right.  Yeah, I mean,  you know,  I don't know.  I don't know.  But it sounds like something  that might have,  you know,  whatever.  Whatever. 
[01:45:30]  I just like the fact that,  you know,  it's like,  hey,  that's Anthony's ex-wife.  It's the only fucking  recognition she'll get.  It's having,  you know,  taken me for a lot of money.  Whoops.  Maybe I'm the asshole.  Yeah,  you're the fucking  cogsucker.  All right,  Chip,  calm down.  Jesus.  You think you could have  done anything differently  in that situation,  looking back?  No,  I mean,  as far as the whole  divorce thing went  and as far as  the amount of money,  it seemed like...  We know in general 
[01:46:00]  guys get fucked over  in divorce settlements,  but it seemed like  they really got you,  considering you didn't  have any kids,  you didn't have a house,  you didn't really  have a car.  Well,  I was coming into  a lot of money,  so they knew it.  Yeah,  I guess I took a gamble  and lost,  because there was  a crossroad time  where I could have  settled out  for a lump sum,  and I didn't.  You let her ride.  I thought maybe, 
[01:46:30]  you know,  there was some kind  of justice  in the court system  as far as...  Would your lump sum  have been less?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Really?  Yep.  But then again,  who knows,  she might have  come back for more.  They just invalidated  that prenup in Long Island,  which is fucking disgraceful.  That's just going to change  everything with divorce  in this country.  How could they  invalidate a prenup?  Because she's  claiming duress.  She's claiming  that he said,  well,  have her take the duress  and everything else  that goes along with it.  The only reason  the prenups popped up  is because guys 
[01:47:00]  knew they were  getting fucked over  over and over again  in divorce cases.  Yeah,  when you come to  a marriage  with a bunch of stuff...  And you can't trust  the court system  to do the right thing.  They never will.  They came up  with this other  little angle,  you know,  to maybe protect  the guys a little bit.  Well,  yeah,  whatever.  Invalidated.  They said...  She said that her family  had sunk 40 grand  into the wedding.  He got her to sign it  a few days before the wedding  and said he'd call  the whole thing off.  And they're like,  well,  he kind of forced...  Don't sign it then! 
[01:47:30]  Right,  of course.  Don't fucking sign it!  Once you sign it,  that's it.  And they said that  they believed her  because she said  that he promised  that he would invalidate  that they had kids.  And they did have kids  and he never did.  Was that in writing?  Fuck you.  And they said  it's rare that the courts  will take...  He said,  she said,  over writing.  Over what's in writing.  He must have been  a terrible witness.  Yeah,  he probably was really bad.  He must have been  a real dummy.  That's not my divorce lawyer.  That's not right  that you have to be  a good witness  to protect yourself. 
[01:48:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  It happens all the time.  You get fucked  because you just look  like a shitty person  or you're a shitty witness.  Yeah,  you're not very eloquent.  How is that fair?  Well,  it's not.  It ain't.  Well,  when we get back,  Louis C.K.  handles a heckler.  This is...  Oh, really?  It's going a bit viral today.  Nice.  Yes.

[02:16:30]  people have  been waiting  a year  exactly  that shows  you the  irrelevance  of it  if I was  in Toledo  last week  this would  still be  not good  but the fact  that I have  never been  there  he was  trying to  help  yeah  I've never  been there  you're going  to do great  I'm sure  the shows  will be fun  they're going  to be a lot  of fun  your new  material is  amazing  and man  getting ready  for that big  special in  Boston  I do love  the new  material 
[02:17:00]  I'm trying  to figure  out how  to get to  Boston  and celebrate  Easter  at the  same  time  Boston  I think  I can  pull it  off  yes you  can  we'll take  Friday off  we'll go up  there nice  you're filming  Friday right  Friday night  two shows  alright so  we'll leave  Thursday after  the show  no smoke  no smoke  no haze  for the show  but you found  out that was  good  well I don't  know if it's  good or not  but let's  just say we  were backed  into a corner  yeah  yeah  what happened  we talked  about this  yesterday  because you  asked Nick Cage 
[02:17:30]  the question  remember  Louis C.K.  kind of gave  you a better  answer  than Nick Cage  did  Nick Cage  didn't give  him shit  well what was  Nick Cage's  answer again  I don't know  apologies  but apologies  you got a little  more than that  from Louis C.K.  yeah  Louis C.K.  who's shot a few  specials and has a  TV show  Nick Cage has been  in movies  since 1980  and Coppola  is his uncle  right  that's right  Coppola is his  uncle  so he doesn't know  anything  come on  some of that 
[02:18:00]  stuff had to  seep in over  the years  rub off somewhere  he saw through  my feeble  attempt  of legitimate  questioning  and he handled  it appropriately  you struck out  in every attempt  to try to  let him know  you were in  show business  you've never  seen  anybody come off  as less important  than I did  because every one  of your attempts  to talk to him  was an attempt  to let him know  that you  are men 
[02:18:30]  in a similar  business  it was just  nothing I said  was resonating  Nick Cage  was the Toledo  of celebrities  that was very  very  that was symbolic  of this weekend  oh  I liked his movie  8mm  I liked it  but he played  Nick Cage in that  it was Nick Cage  in that  that's the only  problem with  Nick Cage movies  he plays Nick Cage  a little too much  8mm was good  and Gandolfini  was in that movie 
[02:19:00]  did you like  Snake Eyes?  he was way  over the top  yeah  he was that  Nick Cage  Tin Man  Ghost Rider  he's a fucking  he's an incredible  Witcher man  there are guys  that play themselves  in a lot of movies  and they get away  with it  they don't change  too much  like that  Daniel Day  Lewis guy  he's a jack  of all trades  man of a million  faces  but you got  the Paul Rudd  plays exactly  the same thing  in every movie  Paul Dudd  Adam Sandler  exact same thing  in every movie  you got the  Nicholas Cage  he does the same 
[02:19:30]  thing in every movie  his bad lieutenant  not so good  no  no  Kytel's was better  oh  Kytel's  fucking great  what are you  going to do  about that  why would you  even do that  yeah  don't do that  I like the TV version  show me how you  eat a fruit roll up  TV  fucking  bad edit version  ugh  yeah  well CNN is showing  dire straits in Detroit  oh they playing  I thought we fixed Detroit 
[02:20:00]  what happened  Detroit got taken over  I know  by white people  by the state  right  yeah the state  took it over  took over the city  the city officially  bankrupt  yeah  and also  there's something  going on in Atlanta  the outskirts of  Atlanta  the outskirts of  the city of Atlanta  there's been so much  corruption and crime  inside Atlanta  that it's  you know  turning into  fucking Detroit  so some of these  outer  little suburb  cities  are branching off  and becoming  independent of 
[02:20:30]  smart  Atlanta  and stacking  what the  NAACP is calling  white power base  in there  so they're getting  all these white  politicians  and they're  flourishing  so the black  politicians are  very angry that  they're being  replaced  and saying now  it's a civil rights  issue  meanwhile they were  given the reins  in Atlanta  and in Detroit  for quite a while  and it's been  nothing but  fucking  horrific  display of  mismanagement  corruption  and incompetence  and isn't it 
[02:21:00]  healthy to just  let these cities  die  you'd think  it would  be  I mean  Buffalo  used to be  an incredible  city  the crime  takes over  the fucking  lack of  employment  the people  that have  anything  constructive  or creative  to do  move out  and it just  crumbles  and they go  somewhere else  Buffalo  had an amazing  industry  Pittsburgh  all these places  and you know  times change  and they kind  of suffer  for it  indeed  they do  but then  somewhere else  you know 
[02:21:30]  does well  Chicago  some parts  some parts  Chicago  were great  some parts  shit  and Detroit  it's a disaster  disaster  puppy  we have to  fly into Detroit  and then drive  to Toledo  oh that's great  now everybody  knows my travel  plans  they'll be waiting  at the airport  that's what we  need  a big line  of fans  oh um 
[02:22:00]  my uh  my web guy  oh  spider-man  he uh  he's an  airborne ranger  really  yeah  yes he is  who is  my web guy  is airborne  ranger on  uh twitter  good luck  spelling uh  born right  it's like the  identity  right  um  jimmy had  some guy  walk across  on stage  on thursday  night  in charlotte  and the look  on his face  was a cross  between chip  and total  amazement  the crowd  started howling 
[02:22:30]  the guy  jimmy what  happened there  i was on stage  there was a guy  coming back  from the bathroom  he didn't walk  completely across  the stage  but he just  literally  like you know  you don't walk  on the stage  just don't do it  of course not  but he had to  to get to his seat  and just the way  he did it so  casually and looked  down  like while he did  it like  it didn't annoy me  the way it should  have  normally that  would have  fucking annoyed  me  but for some  reason  i don't know  why  i didn't think  he was being  a dick  was he looking  down like  if i can't  see everybody 
[02:23:00]  they can't  see me  i think it was  just the fastest  way and he was  just trying to  get to his seat  real quick  i don't know  why it didn't  bug me  so was it a true  heckle  no  not at all  it was just  an unfortunate  situation  he walked down  the wrong aisle  and instead of  turning around  and going around  now he's trapped  because there's  no way to  cut across  so he has to  go on the stage  to pop down  to the other aisle  i got it  got it figured out  my head  crazy  huh  yeah  no one was  hurt though  thank god  that was a nice  club in charlotte  yeah fucking  amazing 
[02:23:30]  that was good  any turkey chili  laying around  yeah we'll get  right on that  i think i could  go for some  turkey chili  what about some  intenses  i love  intonemans  as long as you  can find the  classic  regular chocolate  donut too  it's so good  i can't have  that  and the chocolate  just kind of  cracks when you  bite it  it goes  oh yeah  good stuff right  there  how can you  eat chili  this early

[02:28:30]  Isn't Hare Krishna in this thing?  No.  Yes.  Messes up the song.  Hare Krishna.  Who's he singing about?  I really want to see you, Lord.  But it takes so long, my Lord.  Hare Krishna.

Poor Rhoda.  You didn't even say her name.  No.  It's Rhoda.  Everyone knows who Rhoda is.  Yeah.  Yikes.  It's fucking, she wrote a, ah, fuck, what was she right on?  Buff?  Rhoda. 
[02:29:30]  Mm.  Do you know the connection?  Yes.  Between Rhoda?  Mm-hmm.  And the Simpsons?  Yes.  B-Rock comment.  I know.  What?  Marge Simpson was in Rhoda.  Yeah.  Was that good enough?  Who was she?  I forget her name always.  She was Rhoda's sister, right?  Oh!  Look at me.  I'm fucking ripping off your show.  You just did the Simpsons podcast.  I'm ripping off the E-Lock show.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Now I can book you.  Yes, you can.  Yeah, Rhoda's sister is, uh, Marge Simpson. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  What was her name?  Like, Julie Kavner.  Kavin, Kava.  Kavner.  Julie Kavner.  She was the kind of chunky, unpretty sister of Rhoda that was always talking about.  With a nasally voice.  Yeah.  And how Rhoda was so vivacious and fun and that.  And her sister was just kind of, ah.  Why don't we find a clip to see if she sounded like Marge Simpson back then?  Oh, that's a good idea.  Thank you, Anthony.  There's another clip out there, though, from the Beverly Hillbillies, where Alan Reed, 
[02:30:30]  who was Fred Flintstone, was on the Beverly Hillbillies.  And it's so weird, because you see him, and he sounds just like Fred Flintstone.  Well, we gotta do that one, too.  We gotta do that one, too.  All right, we got some work to do, Sam.  Julie Kavner on Rhoda, and let's see if we can identify her as Marge Simpson's voice.  Rhoda's wedding.  Why is our headdress so big?  I can't believe it.  You know, it seems like just yesterday you moved in, and here you are moving out to get married. 
[02:31:00]  That's fucking Marge Simpson.  That's Marge Simpson.  She's getting paid all that money just to use her real, her regular voice?  Yeah.  I'm married and be just as mauscious as I am right now.  Oh, she's mauscious.  Oh, no.  Well, that's Joe for the Trump.  That cock-wolfing voice really paid off, didn't it?  Hi, Joe.  Hi, honey.  Hiya, Bryn.  Hello, Joe.  We're gonna miss out around here, too.  Oh, the lingering scent of aqua velva. 
[02:31:30]  You know how many people watched this episode of her wedding?  It was huge.  Massive.  Really?  Yes.  This was before my time.  What year was this show on?  She married a doctor from Sloan Kettering.  Oh, no.  No, not cancer jokes.  Oh, it's terrible.  I feel too bad about it to make fun of it.  It is horrible.  I bought the People magazine.  It was really sad.  Really?  Did you?  I can't read that shit.  Oh, don't immerse yourself in sadness.  You know what's happening.  Why would you have to read it, too?  Well, it's a little experience, you know?  Find Alan Reid on the Beverly Hillbillies. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, we did the March Simpson.  That's absolutely March Simpson.  Yes.  She's also doing a little Fran Drescher.  She was the original Fran Drescher with that fucking boy.  Yeah, she had that dewy, whiny, New York-y voice that we all know and love.  This is so weird.  Look at his face.  Look at his face.  Alan Reid, the voice of Fred Flintstone.  Okay.  Could you pull that, um...  Oh, I hate the Flintstones.  That's what that guy looked like?  Mr. Booth, the television station just sent these over.  They're all about last night's wrestling match, and they've been flooded with phone calls. 
[02:32:30]  Bring back the little old lady and the Boston Strong Girl.  Greatest fight ever.  What?  What the fuck?  He just used his own voice.  This is a great find.  He just used his own voice.  Is this before the Flintstones?  No, I think this is during the Flintstones.  Right around the same time, right?  Wait, so this is the Beverly Hillbillies.  Beverly Hillbillies.  Holy fuck, he didn't even try to change it at all.  No, he's playing a part, and it's like, it's fucking Fred Flintstone's voice.  Stop it.  These over.  They're all about last night's wrestling match, and they've been flooded with phone calls. 
[02:33:00]  Bring back the little old lady and the Boston Strong Girl.  Greatest fight ever.  How about a rematch?  Can book Tennessee Terror and Beast of Boston on Ed Sullivan's show.  Guarantee Phil Houston Astrodome.  Rapply Granny Strong Girl rematch.  All right, you're back and show business.  Some Beverly Hillbillies coming to wrestling.  Can I find this little granny?  I'm on my way to see her now. 
[02:33:30]  She wants to talk to me about the mortgage on Donny Brook Farr.  Don't tell me she believes that story about you wrestling just to pay off the mortgage.  She believes the part about the meal banker who's going to foreclose on my sick mom and my crippled daddy.  Hey, I write a pretty good script, huh?  Well, come on, let's not keep the little lady waiting.  You don't like the can laughs, Jimmy?  Fucking stinks.  You don't like the can laughs?  TV sitcoms stunk in the 60s.  That's just how they did it back then.  It was just terrible, I guess.  But they're terrible.  They at least only just peppered it in back then.  The whole thing.  Now it's ridiculous over the top. 
[02:34:00]  We should have turned the break.  The 60s sitcoms were all built to make you forget that Negroes could not share the water fountain.  Is that what it was, a distraction?  Everything on TV was to sweep every fucking ugly piece of shit quality of this country under the rug.  Oh boy, Mrs. Danbury called.  Black people can't go to college.  Fucking, I hate 60s sitcoms. 
[02:34:30]  Play the rest of this clip.  Alan Reed.  Alan Reed.  He got Granny and the Boston Stronger for a rematch.  I want plenty of publicity.  How do you know she'll fight again?  Are you kidding?  Did you get a load of those clothes and the old army shoes?  For 20 bucks, she'll kill you.  So, I have no idea, man.  Yeah.  How did he die, you think?  I gotta go.  I'm guessing.  It has to be the big casino from smoking.  I'm gonna go Hart. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  They all smoked, though.  How did Alan Reed die?  How did Alan Reed die?  And when?  Yeah, when?  When was 1970?  I'm gonna go 1978.  No, 84.  Who said Hart?  Oh.  1977.  Wow.  Heart attack?  Heart attack.  There you go.  Oh.  There you go.  Was it late 77, so officially it was 78?  June. 
[02:35:30]  No.  Died of a heart attack, June 77.  How old was he?  June what, 77?  14th.  That's closer to 78 than 77.  How old was he?  77 or something?  No, it isn't.  69.  69.  We're looking at only a 69-year-old guy?  Mm-hmm.  69.  Well, then the hillbillies, what year?  Probably 10 years prior.  So you're looking at a guy in his 50s?  He looked like shit.  Oh, my God.  Look at how he's leaning on the table.  Those old head shots.  Yeah.  When he would lean on the table. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Just lean over here.  Alan Reed.  Wow.  Good to find out.  Yeah, that was so weird to see, because, you know, you just used to hear him Fred Flintstone.  I fucking hate the Flintstones.  You didn't like the Flintstones.  I hated it.  I loved it growing up.  Never made me laugh once.  Oh, I like that.  I love it, because it was just fantasy shit.  Exactly.  J. Barney!  When they were going to Rock Vegas and fucking, you know, Las Vegas Rock, whatever they're fucking  and all that, and the, of course, the, you know, I am Rock Quarry.  Right. 
[02:36:30]  That episode is so classic.  Hmm.  Oh.  Maybe you'll remember me from my movie, Dr. Jekyll's Hyde.  Ah!  And Fred just punches him in the face.  Yeah, enough of him.  All right.  You're going to have to leave, Gus.  Right.  Hmm.  I'll just be Gus Schultz.  Gus, because he wanted to be a regular guy, and he was a big Hollywood star, so then he  was hanging out with Fred and Barney as Gus Schultz, and then he said, hmm, I'll tell  them who I really am.  They'll get a big kick out of it, and he told them, and they were like, ha ha, Gus, that's 
[02:37:00]  funny, and he goes, no, but I am Rock Quarry, and they're like, all right, Gus, like, relax,  we got the joke already.  I miss Holly Rock.  I miss my fans.  The adulation.  E-Rock?  To you.  To you.  By the way, do you know what was going on there?  Yeah, he was doing the impression on the Flintstones, but what do you want me to say about it?  I was trying to set you up for your bit.  We've done that one.  Oh, yes, of course.  I didn't know that's where you were going. 
[02:37:30]  It ran from 60 to 66.  What?  The Flintstones.  Only 166 episodes.  It was a primetime sitcom.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know it was on in primetime.  A forerunner.  It was a big deal.  Did people watch this on a fucking Tuesday night or whatever?  Yes, they did.  And we're not a bunch of shitheads.  And we only had three channels, so.  If you didn't like the Flintstones, oh, boy, you better like the other two shows that  were on at that time.  What time was it on?  It's on ABC.  Probably 8.  Prime time.  Let's go 8.  Why not? 
[02:38:00]  Rock Quarry's all mad.  And then, in that gas station we found you in, hmm?  But Rock, baby, look at me.  We're fighting.  That's not like us.  I love you like a son.  A son?  He's agent.  Better than a son.  Who has a son that grosses 4 million a picture?  Rocky, baby, take a nap.  You got a big night ahead of you.  Seven shows.  Why is Rock talking?  Think of me as your friend, Rock.  Not as the head of a studio that owns your long-term ironclad contract. 
[02:38:30]  I'll see you later, Rock, baby.  Oh, that's where he decides to leave?  Oh, boy.  The stars.  I feel like I'm watching Bruce Mittman.  I know, right?  Oh, there he goes.  At least at the gas station I had friends.  Friends?  They liked me because I was just plain Gus Schultz.  Not because I was Rock Quarry, the movie star.  I gotta get out of this rat race.  I gotta get away from all this.  I'll get in the car, drive to some small town, lose myself. 
[02:39:00]  There's got to be some place where people don't know me.  Some place where they'll talk to me without asking for my autograph.  What a douche.  Oh, my God.  Rock Quarry's a self-centered asshole.  We got Kyle in Alabama, the lady who does the voice of Lisa, did the same voice in another TV show.  I know the name of the show.  Oh, that girl was also in Maximum Overdrive.  She was the bride, the newly married bride.  She's got that high voice.  She was in Herman's Head, which was a short-lived... 
[02:39:30]  That was my answer.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Imagine a Billie Jean.  What?  Oh, Yardley Smith.  Yardley Smith.  Yardley Smith.  Was in Herman's Head.  Yeah.  That show didn't do too well.  It almost did well.  It was one of those shows that almost made it.  She's weird-looking, very kind of...  Yeah, didn't we meet her?  No, we met Bart.  Yeah, we met Bart Simpson.  One of our first...  Pretty much our first week doing radio together, we met Bart Simpson.  Yeah.  Out there in L.A.  What happened to William Ragsdale from Herman's Head? 
[02:40:00]  Oh, man.  Hey, who's that guy?  Hey, rewind.  There's that fat guy.  He was in this.  Who's he?  Hold on.  Who's that?  And who's that guy?  And who's the other guy?  And that guy, too.  And him.  There's some big kind of guy.  What's Herman's Head?  I never saw this.  Oh, this is terrible.  It was on After Married with Children.  Hank Azaria was in this?  Yes, he was.  What the hell's going on?  Jane Sibet.  Yep.  She was in it.  She was in it. 
[02:40:30]  Early 90s?  I'm going to go early 90s on this one.  Yardley Smith.  Molly Hagan.  Ken Hudson Campbell.  Who is he?  What is he doing?  He looks familiar.  Who is that guy?  The fat guy.  I've seen him.  He doesn't look familiar to me.  Don't say you're not.  I heard it.  He looks totally familiar.  I've seen him in stuff.  It might just be a commercial.  He does a lot of voiceover.  Or it might be something else.  What has he been in?  Home Alone. 
[02:41:00]  Groundhog Day.  What?  Home Alone.  Home Alone?  What recently?  I've seen him recently.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was the fat dude in Groundhog Day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  No, he was the bellhop.  Really?  Was he?  Yes, in Groundhog Day.  Go to all filmography.  He was the bellhop or whatever the fuck.  He worked at the hotel that Bill Murray had to go back to over and over again.  I've seen him recently.  Have they figured out how long Bill Murray was in that state? 
[02:41:30]  Has some movie buff figured that out?  No.  Was it a couple months?  Was it a year?  It had to be years.  You think it was years?  I would assume.  But has anyone ever figured that out?  Or have a pretty educated guess?  Everything he did to play the piano like that, to fucking, it would have had to have been  a long time.  Ten years?  I watched that show.  I watched that show.  Every time that movie's on, I stop.  I love that movie.  I stop.  Groundhog Day.  Have you ever seen the whole thing?  Oh, it's really good.  I like it.  I want to watch the whole thing.  I just keep forgetting. 
[02:42:00]  I love you.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  I like it.  Well, you're Ned, Ned Ryerson.  Yeah, but he was the bellhoppy guy, whatever you called him, at the hotel that Bill Murray  was in.  That guy.  And he was in Herman's Head.  Yes.  Definitely.  I've seen him recently, though, in something.  Just can't quite.  It says he was in an episode of Curb.  Oh, bullshit.  Yeah, that's just a flat-out lie.  Was he in 2007, though?  Was he in Armageddon? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, my God.  He was in Armageddon.  That's where I know him from.  Come on.  How do you know this?  He's the fat guy from Armageddon.  That's where I remember him from, then.  What did he play in Armageddon?  The fat guy.  That was drilling the...  He was the guy in the drill rig when the drill rig explodes, and he fucked in.  He shoots off in a space?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why do you think it would stop you?  No, he would just keep going.  Oh, he's still going.  Oh, that's terrible.  He's with Buscemi in that clip.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's where I remember.  That's the face that I remembered from Armageddon, so any other movie. 
[02:43:00]  And what about...  Why was he Santa Claus?  Do we know?  He's fat.  Where is he Santa?  Oh, there.  Home Alone, probably.  Home Alone 3 or something like that.  Okay.  Yeah.  Did we talk about how awful Miracle on 34th Street was?  The original?  That movie fucking ate my ass.  You don't like the little Natalie Wood?  Oh, is that her?  The little girl was Natalie Wood.  Oh, I should have got her swimmies.  I didn't know that was her. 
[02:43:30]  But I was watching it.  I'm like, it was colored in.  But the 50s acting and stuff...  God, I fucking love Brando for hating all their guts.  Isn't 50s acting the worst?  It takes me out of every movie I was.  Well, darling, I think we'll go down to the store.  Well, the girls were supposed to be here, but they're not.  Who talks like this?  Absolutely no one.  I'll go outside and get the car, darling.  They got that from the stage.  Yes, but it was that stage acting.  Right.  They didn't know any better. 
[02:44:00]  Over the top.  It has to come out and reach out across the footlight.  Right.  They didn't know any better.  That's all they knew.  Okay, Ralph.  At the time.  They should have felt better.  Like, there's certain things you don't know, but I instinctively know that if I act, I  shouldn't put my hands over my head and flutter them like antennae.  I just kind of know that.  So you should just know to talk normal.  Yes.  Don't talk like that, dear.  Yeah.  Gregory in New Jersey.  Gregory.  Greg?  Hello, yeah.  Hi, Gregory.  I heard that thing with Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. 
[02:44:30]  He was probably in that movie for, like, hundreds of years.  Because if you think, like, how long would it take for him to perfect, like, playing the  piano?  Or, like...  Ant said all that.  I thought you had the real answer.  You could just guess it.  You could play a piano for less than 100 years and be really good.  Exactly.  How long do you think people play the piano for before they get good?  That's silly good.  That's the main answer point.  If you have a day, you could practice a couple hours every day.  But he also did other things, though.  So it's piano, and then, you know...  But some dumb, like, movie geeky guy hasn't figured this shit out. 
[02:45:00]  For real?  It's true.  Look it up.  It's 100 years.  Oh, you're getting your info from somewhere.  No, he's not.  I got a question.  Like, how long would it take for him to perfect ice sculpting?  Yeah, you know, along with the piano playing.  Yeah, probably a couple of days of ice.  Sure, yep.  You guys want to talk to the kid that played piano with Billy Joel on YouTube yesterday?  I would like to, yeah.  Why, is he here?  Like, in five minutes?  Yeah.  What?  No.  That's such an after-show guest.  That's one.  No.  No.  Yes.  It's going to be a no.  All right. 
[02:45:30]  What could he possibly say?  What was he going to add?  Let me think.  Let me think.  Well, you said yesterday it's a work.  I think it's a work, but he ain't going to say it's a work.  Well, you could bust his balls.  I don't think it's a work, but I don't really care anymore.  That was yesterday.  Where is he now?  We're now into today.  Out cue?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I figured.  Why?  Yeah, just saying.  How was it playing with him?  Fabulous, I bet.  I bet it was fabulous.  No.  No, he's not.  He's not a fabulous guy. 
[02:46:00]  What?  Did you hear the clip?  Oh, I guess I did.  Really?  Boy.  Really?  When he asks.  Oh, really?  When he first asks.  We don't have to play the whole piano part, but let's see when he first asks.  I might have that still.  Oh, jeepers, creepers.  How did he get those eyes?  Where did he get those?  Here it is.  This is him asking Billy Joel if he could play piano for him.  Are they all pointing to you?  Okay. 
[02:46:30]  My favorite song of yours is New York State of Mind.  Heard enough.  He's all nervous.  You're right.  Heard enough.  You're right.  My favorite song of yours is New York State of Mind.  And?  He sounds nervous, right?  Yeah.  Oh, I have a little wave there.  Oh, fuck.  He waved at.  We've got the...  A little blonde.  I'm an intern.  What?  She's talented, though.  Fuck.  That's nice.  Let's say...  Sounds like a no, then.  No. 
[02:47:00]  There's some girls walking around this joint that are pretty fucking attractive.  I know.  I've got to fluff my fucking prick up in the bathroom.  You want a good presentation always, right, Jimmy?  Fuck, yeah.  Today's a travel day.  I've got these baggy fucking sweats on.  You want to present?  Yeah, I do.  Like a baboon.  I fluff my prick up so it sticks out like a baboon vagina.  Red and ugly.  You were saying something yesterday on your show about your prick.  Or somebody's prick.  You're like, yeah, just... 
[02:47:30]  You know, I've got to get my prick in there.  It made me fucking laugh my ass off.  It's just so gross to be...  If you fluff it up, you're a prick.  It's just an intrusive word.  It is, yeah.  Prick.  We got the answer, maybe, to the groundhog question.  What?  Wayne in Georgia.  Wayne.  Hey, guys.  I had a...  We had a similar debate, and we went on...  We spent about a year or so trying to figure this out, and then Reddit came out with something  as well.  The answer is 12,043 days. 
[02:48:00]  Wow, that's pretty specific.  Is that the exact answer?  That's specific.  No, that's what...  Yeah, that's the exact answer.  I can send you the article.  So just under four years, I guess, if my math sucks.  No, 12,000 days.  Oh, you said 12,000.  12,043.  Holy shit, I missed that.  I thought you said 1,200.  Now, how do they get such a large number?  It's a joke.  I think they're kidding.  Oh.  Well, they actually...  Like I said, I can send you the article.  They break it down.  That's under 40 years, you're thinking?  Oh, so they got all the days of what would take that long, and that long, and that long. 
[02:48:30]  And then they got Harold Ramis on his...  Harold Ramis says it's more than 10 years, but he doesn't go into specifics on the DVD  commentary.  Oh.  Why wouldn't he?  He probably didn't figure it out.  Yeah, he's busy.  But can't you multitask, do a little ice sculpting, and then play the piano a little bit?  You'd think.  You would think, yeah.  33 years.  So you're looking at just a hair under 34 years.  Oh.  This article is...  34 years of everything being exacted.  Oh, my God. 
[02:49:00]  There you go.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  That rocks.  All right.  Well, at least we got a kind of answer.  I like when we get kind of answers for our weird questions.  34 years.  I hate groundhogs.  Fucking hate that dumb holiday.  You don't like...  We missed it this year.  It was on the weekend.  Puxitani Phil.  I detest...  And Staten Island fucking syphilis.  I detest Puxitani Phil.  You do?  Yeah.  We didn't get to enjoy it this year.  We didn't.  It was on a weekend, right?  Yep.  We usually do a big thing.  Yep. 
[02:49:30]  I look forward to when Puxitani Phil is mowed down by like a fucking Datsun.  His little back, his tire tracks in his...  Oh, he's just cracked back, laying in the street, convulsing.  Yes.  Not a quick death.  His asshole's on the sidewalk.  He's mid-street.  Puxitani Phil.  Fired out his ass.  Yeah, well, if he sees his asshole, that means ten more years of summer.  Oh, good.  Ten years?  Yeah.  It's like a little fucking asterisk in the Groundhog Day rule book. 
[02:50:00]  If he sees his asshole and it's more than 30 feet away from him...  It's ten years of summer.  I like that.  Oh, my God.  I posted the other Chrysler building video, finally.  Yes, I saw that.  That was with the gentleman out there on the big...  Eagle head.  Eagle head.  I don't know why I, since then, have had kind of little anxiety attacks, because I keep going  back to that day with that slippery metal eagle shit.  Stainless steel is so slippery.  Stainless steel.  And the wind like that. 
[02:50:30]  Moses Gates, who's going to be in here in, what, two weeks now?  I think the 25th is the day he comes in to promote his book, Hidden Cities.  Moses NYC on Twitter took me on a nice little fucking tour.  I would like to go to that, man.  I couldn't go out there.  It'd be funny if he fell.  I think it might be too late now, now that it's kind of out there.  Started getting out there the last couple weeks.  Yeah.  Everyone's aware that that office is completely empty, and that's how people are getting  access to that old observation deck.  Oh, they've got to be onto it now, right? 
[02:51:00]  It's an old observation deck.  I show the empty office in the video.  That's nice.  And then you...  How is that office empty?  I know.  That's so nice.  That's like...  Pause.  That's what I was wondering.  This office is amazing, and then there's doors that open up to the old observation deck,  which I've since learned closed in 1945.  What?  People haven't really done anything up there since 1945.  I'm sure people that live in the building every once in a while will go up there, you know? 
[02:51:30]  But I'm sure after the Empire State Building was built, they were like, fuck this shit.  Who cares?  And I went out on the actual observation deck.  That guardrail that you're looking at in the video right there?  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember.  It was not even four feet high.  Now you can hop right over that or fall over it.  Yeah, so...  Because people are like, why the fuck wouldn't they keep that open?  It would be so dangerous if you had people out there on a regular basis.  But back in the day, they just didn't think anything of it, and they allowed people.  Sure.  Step on out there. 
[02:52:00]  Holy fuck.  Have a drink and some cigarettes.  Howling up there.  There were 72 suicides a day.  Yeah, the fucking eagle.  The eagle had fucking footprints on his head.  But the freeze frame in the video, I got a nice shot.  The sun was going down when we went up there.  You got the Empire State Building to the right, and then you got downtown with the big Freedom Tower in the distance.  And you got the shiny stainless steel eagle head that obviously is, you know, out over the building. 
[02:52:30]  Jets out like a gargoyle.  It's fucking terrifying, this one.  And look at the stainless steel.  Like, I have a tough time watching this.  It looks slippery.  Because I was there, and I was like, this guy's going to fucking slip.  And then what the fuck do I do?  Someone said on Twitter, you walk away like Bill Murray did in Caddyshot.  Yeah, yeah.  You just fucking...  And just skulk away.  You know what it is?  Yeah, the stainless steel, it's like fucking...  There's no paint on it.  There's no, like, oxidation from steel where it gets a little gritty or something.  It's so smooth. 
[02:53:00]  And with that howling wind like that, it's crazy.  And it's not flat.  It's flat sort of like in the middle, if that makes sense.  But then it quickly has a curve to it.  And you are precariously, you know, that guy's precariously perched.  Can we see it?  You haven't seen it yet?  I have, but it bothers me.  I've never watched it again.  It's crazy.  And, you know, because Moses is talking about it on his Twitter, and he's trying to say  it wasn't as windy that day.  I left a shot in this video just to kind of show you how windy it actually was that day. 
[02:53:30]  Scary.  Because all you hear is wind noise in one of my shots.  Yeah.  But how is that office?  It's probably so expensive.  I bet it is, yeah.  It's a beautiful spot.  You would think someone would grab that.  I wonder if the building leaves it empty because I know people can still get to it.  Yeah.  Well, it wasn't easy to get outside.  I'll just tell you that much.  What movie was that where they made it seem like the Chrysler building, the top was someone's  office.  It was like really posh.  Wasn't that the Will Smith movie?  Was it a Men in Black situation?  I don't think so.  It might have been Alec Baldwin in the office. 
[02:54:00]  I can't remember what it was.  Oh, somebody help us out.  I don't know.  It looked because you could see the Hudsucker proxy.  What?  Really?  It might have been.  You could see like the way the windows look from the outside and it was that, but you  could tell it was much bigger inside than it would have been outside.  Well, the windows kind of locked, but we were able to, not locked, but you couldn't lift  them from, you know, up.  Right.  We had to lift from the ceiling down and then we had to kind of hoist ourselves up and over 
[02:54:30]  the top.  Did you get outside?  Yeah.  How'd you get back in?  Same way.  I should have broke the fucking window.  Yikes.  No kidding.  At any moment, I'm like, we're going to get arrested.  This is fucking crazy.  Yeah, that is crazy.  So you're outside now.  What are the 60 stories up?  The observational deck goes to, I want to say 60.  The Aviator.  Alec Baldwin's office when he was the head of Pan Am.  Okay.  Thank you, Sean, the producer.  Maybe that's where it really was.  And then from there, just to give you a point of reference, we went up some stairs for another 
[02:55:00]  10 or 10 or somewhere around 10 to 12 stories in the stairwell to the, that was it.  There's nowhere else to go.  And that's where we got access to the ladders into the spire.  And that goes all the way up to, I think, 925 feet.  Do you have that video?  Yeah.  I put that online a couple of days ago.  Oh, I didn't see that.  Let's see the guy walk out there.  I want to do this.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  No, I've had weird anxiety since this fucking day, for real.  Would you do it, Sam?  No joke.  No.  No. 
[02:55:30]  No.  I would like to think I would.  No.  Wait till you see this.  The view is right now.  Wow.  There he is.  All right.  Let me just fucking hop over the fucking little guardrail.  There's no safety.  There's no gauge.  He literally stepped over the edge.  And you hear the wind.  He's sitting on the eagle's head.  He's standing on it.  He's standing with his arms in the air.  On a big gust.  If a big gust of wind, it would have blown him right off of it.  Pause.  You're in New York City.  Yeah, then.  I'll go back slightly.  And then I just go to the shot so you get the full understanding of what he just did. 
[02:56:00]  There's the fucking eagle.  How does he know that a gust of wind, 50 miles an hour, isn't going to come and just blow him off of there with no chance of saving yourself?  You don't.  He doesn't.  Imagine falling from the fucking Chrysler building.  No, I wouldn't like that.  He would just be like, oh, fuck.  What happened?  I was just on the eagle.  But I'm thinking, how do I explain this?  You'd be in trouble.  But what kind of trouble?  You'd be in trouble.  Suffice to say.  This has played over my head late at night way too many times.  I thought it would be no big deal in the end, but it just has popped up some things. 
[02:56:30]  No, you wouldn't.  Because look how fucking shiny that thing is.  All right, continue.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's not.  Well, I mean, that is something.  But then he just, he did it, one, two, he did it three times while we were up there.  Three different ways.  He just stepped over and didn't, I mean, I can't comprehend it.  No, and then watch this.  I would never do that.  This guy here is Nelly, or I guess Gallows.  You should pull that mic back.  Well, that's Maude.  And it's just like, you know, you see shots of this.  You see Margaret Ford White's great pictures. 
[02:57:00]  You see, you know, Will Smith jumping off of him.  Oh.  And you're just like, you know, you see him from the ground.  You're just like, how do you, what would it be like to be here?  I'm going to show you a view of how far up we are.  Oh, my God.  A little pan down and then back up so you get the feel.  You always have to kind of get a kiss.  Now watch this.  Sam, you wouldn't do this?  No way.  I wouldn't even go up there.  He goes over again.  Look at it.  And now he's crawling out there. 
[02:57:30]  Look how slippery that is.  He's got to crawl over a light fixture.  Oh, he says, that's not good enough.  He goes past the light to kiss the fucking eagle head.  This is what gets, hold on.  Pause, pause, pause, pause, pause.  This is what has given me anxiety right here.  He now has to turn around to get back into, you know, a safe spot.  And I've played it over and over and over again in my hand that he slips.  Because he, my hands are sweating.  Dude, he's.  Oh, it's terrible.  How many, how wide is that?  If you have a wide stance, let's say you have a wide stance, then he maybe has less than a foot on each side after that. 
[02:58:00]  It's Larry Craig plus six inches.  Okay.  So now you have a wide stance and you're facing outward.  Now you've got to turn your body around in this tiny space with a little wind on what looks like a very slippery fucking surface.  What's he gone?  What's he gone?  Look at me, Opie.  Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me.  Look at me, Opie.  I'm dancing.  You didn't call me.  But he's got to crawl over the hot light.  Yeah.  Watch the turnaround.  This is what has freaked me out. 
[02:58:30]  What if you panicked and got stuck and you, I can't get my dick back over the light.  I have to stay here.  And if you're holding on and all of a sudden, whoosh.  And you're like, you know that if you lift your head up, you're getting blown off.  Get the fire department.  Get the fire department.  Not even a fucking, not even fucking like a rope around your waist and tie it to the rail.  Yeah.  Something.  Shoelace around your cock.  Right.  I know there's a million type of videos like this out there, but what is bothersome is  just how, like, slippery that surface looked to me.  All right. 
[02:59:00]  So watch the turnaround.  Go back just slightly.  I don't like this at all.  Oh, it's so.  Your palms are sweaty?  Yeah.  It's harrowing.  All right.  Look at that foot.  It's so close to the edge.  He's got it.  That turnaround.  And he stands up.  He's going to fall one day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's fucking cool as shit.  I'd like to see him do that with Vaseline shoes.  Oh, man.  Put some Vaseline on his shoes.  Watch that hot shot. 
[02:59:30]  This is the wind shot I left in the video just so you could get a feel of how windy it was  up there.  That was the third time he did it.  Imagine if the thing just, for some reason, snaps off.  And you're just falling with it.  Yeah.  And look, look at the still shots I added at the end, just to give you an idea.  Now he's just sitting out there.  He thinks he's Spider-Man.  I wouldn't do that if there were handrails.  If that was enclosed, I wouldn't do it.  Look at the fucking, he's just sitting out on the eagle head. 
[03:00:00]  That's scary.  I've been sitting on that video for three fucking months.  Finally got out there.  Craig, Craig.  That's a fucking good one.  Check it out.  I tweeted it on my Twitter, OP Radio.  Should be one of my last tweets.  So frightening.  It's doing really well, though.  My word.  And then me climbing the ladders in the spire is pretty cool.  I want to see that.  Hey, spire.  So we're really high up in the Chrysler building, way above the observational deck.  This is the highest actual floor. 
[03:00:30]  Right.  Like the doors, the stairs in here, there's the door.  One, 72 stories up.  You can see we're not at the top.  And what, we have to follow these ladders?  Up the ladders.  Pause.  Up some more ladders.  Up some more ladders.  Up some more.  I can be honest.  I'm trying to be cool.  But the whole time, like, when, all right, just let me know.  When do we get arrested?  How is there nobody up there?  I'm like, when do we get arrested?  I'm trying to be fucking Joe Cool.  But the whole time, I'm like, it's just a matter of time.  Some security camera somewhere sees that these two idiots are in this area. 
[03:01:00]  Why don't they have security cameras up there?  Someone said in the video you could see a security camera.  I don't know exactly where.  No one was watching the feed.  And then you've got these tiny little ladders that start at the bottom of the spire,  which is the fucking structure at the top of the Chrysler building.  And it just gets smaller and smaller as you climb.  And then you get into a room that's not a room.  There's no real rooms.  A space that is like an eagle's nest that's maybe 10 feet by 10 feet.  Maybe.  You went all the way up, right?  Yeah.  We went as high as you could. 
[03:01:30]  I don't want to sound like Panicky Pete or anything, but what the fuck?  Someone could bring explosives up there and blow the entire top of the Chrysler building off all over Manhattan.  Manhattan.  You do realize that you could get some things done if you really had that mindset.  Scary.  But there were a couple light bulbs on in there, so I'm like, all right, they must be.  And then I'm like, all right, if there's light bulbs on, someone's going to turn off the lights eventually for the night.  No.  I don't know.  You're right.  I don't know.  I've never seen this video.  All right.  So then I just try to be cool, and I'm just climbing up one ladder after another. 
[03:02:00]  Tiny little ladders that maybe are maybe a foot across.  Maybe.  Yeah, little utility ladders.  Right.  But they're, you know, they're very secure.  Yeah.  Still got to go all the way up there, up these ladders.  Oh, yuck.  Damn.  Is that closed in?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  But you're getting hit with wind?  No, it's all the, uh, not many people have gone this high. 
[03:02:30]  As we keep climbing upward.  That's crazy.  Going in between all of these beams.  The craziest thing, though, right, is you think of the Chrysler building as, like, art deco, shiny, chrome, metal, you know, metal everywhere.  And you're inside, and it's all reinforced concrete, you know, and you never would have thought of it.  I expected, like, shiny silver beams holding up this fire in here, too.  And we're almost to the top. 
[03:03:00]  We're going way up there.  Holy shit.  It's like you're...  It's going much higher than right there.  Wow.  See?  Pause.  Just made it to the top of the Chrysler building.  Yeah, that's made from, like, exhaustion and heat.  And I do remember now, that was a lot of wind, because there's a lot of holes in this thing.  Yeah.  You think it's all nice and pristine and, you know, well kept.  But there's a bunch of holes and shit in there.  So when it rains, water just comes flying in there?  I don't know.  I guess.  They probably do that.  So it doesn't...  The holes keep the wind blowing through it, so it doesn't stress? 
[03:03:30]  Stress?  I don't know.  But you see this.  This is it.  You know, a building starts out almost like a whole city block, and now we're down to that.  Yeah.  It's no more than 10 feet by 10 feet.  And that's it.  That's all the space.  Would you have been scared if you heard a crack and then your fucking thing fell over?  Dude, I was...  I'm not going to sit here and try to be cool.  I was scared shitless the whole time.  You're not going to front, yo?  I was trying to be cool.  Absolutely I was trying to be cool.  But I'm like, this is fucking scary as hell.  The ladders themselves were scary.  Did you find Bill Clay up there?  Was Bill Clay there? 
[03:04:00]  Look at old Bill Clay.  Bill.  Bill Clay.  Bill Clay.  How do they get up on top?  Because every building has an airplane light, a red light.  Right.  How do they get up on top to change that?  How do you get outside and on top to change that light?  Since I posted this video, I've heard from a lot of guys.  One guy says, hey man, I've cleaned those windows.  On the inside or outside?  I don't know.  Who sees them?  Who cares?  I have no idea.  How do you get that fucking light changed?  I don't know, because it's a weird structure. 
[03:04:30]  We're basically going to a point.  It has to be from inside you change the bulb.  Right.  We went even higher than this, but there's nothing really up there.  It's just like more crawl space, but there's no light whatsoever in that.  I'll bet you that's how you change the bulb.  You probably unscrew something and then you put the bulb up through.  Maybe.  Why would you go on the very top to change the bulb?  That would be idiotic.  Yeah.  But I went sort of back down to this nesty area, because that's where the last windows,  if you Google image the Chrysler Building, the last windows near the point, that's where 
[03:05:00]  this video was taken right here.  The rest of this.  Hit play.  It is so hot in here.  Climbed through a network of ladders.  At least 100 to 200 feet.  More like 200.  All right.  What a trip.  Look out the windows. 
[03:05:30]  A lot of cell phone antennas and all kinds of stuff out there.  It's a tiny little space here.  I don't even know if this video does it justice.  This is pretty crazy, Moses.  I know, man, but it's really fun.  Yeah.  And, you know, I really, honestly, I think everybody should be allowed to see this.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, let the city do that.  Yeah, the mayor that doesn't want you drinking sodas is going to let you climb on a fucking 
[03:06:00]  precarious ladder.  Yeah.  Mayor, we don't want you to get fat from soda.  It's going to, you know, they should just allow everybody to walk out on stainless steel  eagle heads in the wind.  Jesus.  This guy's out of his bird.  Then let him climb the tiny little ladders.  Yeah, the tiny ladders.  All the way to this tiny crawl space.  Sure, sure.  You're way up, dude.  Look at this.  Yeah, that's crazy.  I can't believe how much more space there is after the Eagles. 
[03:06:30]  How much higher that building goes.  The Eagles, like I said, the Eagles and then at least 10 to 12 stories through the stairwell  because I don't think there was an elevator at that point.  I think the elevator ended at the observation deck.  And then after the 10 or 12 stories in the stairwell, that's when we started our climb  to the top of the spire.  Were there offices up there at all or no?  No.  What's up there?  Just nothing?  Oh, between the observation deck?  And that, yeah.  We didn't really go into the floor area, so I don't know. 
[03:07:00]  But after it gets to a certain point of where it's just that stainless steel cap on the building,  it's just structural, right?  It's just like cosmetic for the outside.  Aesthetics.  Look, man.  I don't know.  It's pretty amazing we got access to where we were because he had to do something that  was even pretty fucking scary.  You see this weird cement shit?  We were in a room, and then there's weird cement shit. 
[03:07:30]  We were done.  He's like, oh, fuck.  Now what?  And then he decided to climb between the weird cement shit and the outside.  Yeah.  Wow.  Right up against, I guess, would be the stainless steel or the spire.  And just started climbing, hoping that there was something up above us.  Like, it's almost impossible to do what we did.  Yeah.  Was there anything above you?  He found it.  And then he goes to me, hey, meet me up on the next floor. 
[03:08:00]  Because officially we weren't at the highest floor yet.  Then he let me in because he climbed this weird thing.  And then that was officially the last floor.  And then the star of the ladders.  But we found a dead end is basically what I'm saying.  But he figured it out.  But you didn't look in any of the offices that were up there or no?  Dude.  Just by people working?  I was thinking any door we open, we're going to fucking get arrested.  No, of course not.  I was just like, holy fuck, dude. 
[03:08:30]  How much longer are we doing this?  How did you get all the way up to the top office of the elevator?  What?  What?  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to talk.  Oh, okay.  I'll get it.  Yeah.  No, it was all on the up and up.  Yeah?  Was it?  The first part was all on the up and up.  Without saying how.  Yeah, yeah.  But if I explain it to you, oh, God, that's pretty fucking brilliant.  I'll tell you all fair.  Damn.  He might even tell you on air.  That's up to him.  I want him to take me up there.  If you get arrested with trespassing, I mean, it's like you're doing any damage.  We did not enter the building illegally, is all I'll say. 
[03:09:00]  The building.  Right.  And then we went, you know, where we were supposed to go.  And then after that, you know, you just wandered around a little bit.  Were there signs that said, no, people be on this point?  Give me a lie detector test.  Oh, right.  I have one.  I don't know.  You've got to hold this in your mouth for 20 minutes that detects any lies.  Give me a lie detector test.  How did Moses get into some things?  I don't know.  You don't know.  Nope.  You didn't see one sign.  I don't know. 
[03:09:30]  No, man, I'm not even joking.  Yeah.  I purposely didn't fucking...  Didn't look?  Nope.  Hmm.  Nope.  So, all right.  So now...  As you turned and...  I need a break.  It just made me laugh so hard.  Could you go back to the...  Everyone should be able to do this.  Everyone should be able to do this.  Like you said, in a city where they want to take away your big gulp.  Yeah, yeah, a big gulp is too dangerous to fucking have.  You're not to be trusted with a big gulp.  But, you know, let's scale the inside of a fucking building where there's nothing but 
[03:10:00]  concrete cross members and fucking small ladders.  And if you fell off one of those ladders, you would hurt yourself a lot on the way down.  You'd look like the fucking Plinko chip.  Yes.  What's that?  Yeah, you'd play Plinko.  I get it.  You would bounce off...  You would bounce off so much shit.  Yeah.  And different shit, too.  From cement to metal to fucking wires.  But you know what?  Everybody should.  I love it. 
[03:10:30]  Push play.  And, you know, I really...  I honestly think everybody should be allowed to see this and do this.  Like, we're up here on the tire of the fucking Chrysler building, man.  Like...  Yeah.  It's like kind of nothing more iconic.  You know, I can look...  I'm just looking right across 42nd Street right now.  We're in a tiny little crawl space at the top of the Chrysler building.  But the thing is, like, if I were here on a mountain right now, standing just like this,  nobody would think it was dangerous.  No one would think twice.  Right.  Nobody would be like, what are you doing? 
[03:11:00]  It's only because it's like a building that people get uptight.  But, man, this is like cooler than a lot of mountains.  There we go.  To the depths of hell.  He leaves.  This is unbelievable.  One last look.  I'd take her up there and fucking eat her ass.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that window.  Oh, phew.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Phew.  All right, freeze!  Freeze! 
[03:11:30]  Look at the hole.  Yeah, look at that.  There's just holes in the side.  Wow.  Then back on the ground.  Okay, back on the ground here in New York City.  Just wanted to show you where we were.  This is the world-famous Chrysler building.  And yes, we were at the top of that.  That's crazy.  It's just an amazing experience.  Drop the camera.  Drop it!  Fuck.  Yeah, then I'm on the ground going, no one knows what I just fucking did.  And this was all in one day.  This started with the mole people video that I talked about months ago. 
[03:12:00]  We went mole people, underground exploring.  And then he goes, are you cool for something else?  I'm like, yeah, what?  He goes, I can't tell you.  And we jump in a cab.  And he goes, don't even look out the windows.  I want it to be a surprise.  But then, you know, I kind of know New York.  And I realized, holy fuck, we're heading toward the Chrysler building.  What the f-  And then we get out of the Chrysler building.  What's that about?  He goes, yeah, just follow me.  Don't even, don't say anything.  Don't say a word.  And then we just walk in.  And I have, like, tremendous guilt. 
[03:12:30]  Because I know, you know, I have no reason to be in this building.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, you fast forward five minutes.  We're out on this observation deck that they closed in 1945 with the eagle's heads.  Yo, what happens?  Okay, he's climbing above you.  You're there.  He falls.  He hits you.  You both now fall.  You're tumbling, hitting off of those beams.  You finally land on some kind of platform.  He's dead.  You are paralyzed completely, but alive.  And you're like, help me.  Oh, my God.  And you know, no one goes up there.  You're just, oh, my God. 
[03:13:00]  I got a cell phone.  But you can't use it.  I'll figure it out.  You hear it go, you hear your cell phone go, but you can't move to get it.  Oh, my God.  You would just rot up there.  You're a sick fuck.  No one goes up there.  Very dangerous.  That eagle is fucking scary.  If you want to impress a girl, though, man, you go up there.  Yeah.  Jerk off on her ass.  That little nesty area.  I like the idea of eating her ass up there.  Just looking out the window.  Look, that's a nice view.  Or if she wouldn't give you anything while she's looking out the window, you just start  jerking off against her thigh, and she'd be so distracted by the view. 
[03:13:30]  You think the view would distract her enough where you'd jerk off on her thigh?  She'd be like, hey, what are you, and then you go, oh, look.  And you point.  Pretty.  How were those ladders attached?  Very securely, yeah.  They didn't move.  They didn't move.  But they're straight up.  There's no angle whatsoever.  Those ladders I would actually do.  I would never do them.  I was so scared.  It was creepy because they're straight up.  You know how most ladders get a little angle so it's not as bad?  Yeah, yeah.  When they go straight up like that, that always creeped me out.  What happens if you get up there?  90 degree angle.  And then when you're up there, you just hear the ladders fall. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, boy.  And you can't climb down anything.  No.  Well, there's plenty of stuff to climb down up there.  I wouldn't be that.  The eagle's scared me.  The outside's shit's scared me.  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't even go there.  No way.  I'd have to break down something.  I would maybe step over the guardrail.  No way.  Holding on, though, still.  Do you think you'd do that with socks?  Oh, my God.  Tell them to go out there with some socks on.  Brand new white socks, yeah.  On a windy day.  And then you do the fucking... 
[03:14:30]  And you slide out onto the eagle.  In your undies.  Yeah.  Know what's cool?  Go up.  Go to the eagles.  Google image it.  They got pictures of people out on those eagles way back in the day when women still were wearing their hats and their flowy dresses.  That's when men were crazy.  Yeah, watch.  I mean, yeah, just Google image this shit.  There's a few.  Like this old-time photographer.  Look at this lady up there.  Oh, look at her.  Ah. 
[03:15:00]  That's got to be in the 40s, right?  She's got a giant muff.  Let me see.  Yeah.  Keep going.  At least she's in something, though.  Oh, yeah.  She's standing in the eagle.  You could stand in the eagle back then?  No way.  Oh, that might be where they put the light.  That's where the light is now.  That's where the light is.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, boy.  What's that?  That's just construction workers.  They're hanging off the eagle.  To fix it.  Doing something to the nose.  Wow.  Yeah, see, there's guys.  But they're all workers.  Yeah, but they should get the credit for this.  You've got to give them credit. 
[03:15:30]  They should have fucking snapped a picture and sent it out there a long time ago.  Look at those two boxers.  They're duking it out on the eagle.  What the fuck are they duking it out on the eagle's for?  Would you hate to be hanging from the eagle's mouth there?  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  How'd you get back up?  Losing your grip.  Look at this.  Two old boxers or something.  They're not that old.  They have sneakers.  Whoa.  That's got to be early 60s.  I'll open a comedy club up there.  You stand on the eagle's head, just tell a bunch of jokes.  What am I, a bird brain or something? 
[03:16:00]  A bird brain.  Sam, you wouldn't do this?  No.  Oh, why?  I wouldn't even go out on the deck.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, you wouldn't even go out on the deck?  Nope.  Why?  That was easy.  It's terrifying.  That part was just easy.  Go out on the deck, yeah.  I wouldn't go out on the deck.  No.  Guard rail is pretty low, though.  That's what I mean.  You're like, why would they make this a little higher?  I guess they didn't want to fuck up the view or something.  Yeah, it's got to look good.  What's that from?  Sorcerer's Apprentice.  That's Nicolas Cage, right?  Hmm. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you stay on this eagle's head?  I can.  You think he really did, or is that CGI?  He's not that far out on it, so I think he might have.  I doubt it.  No.  Fucking.  They took a picture.  They CG'd that.  You think?  It ain't even real.  Okay.  Of course.  No fucking way.  All right.  All right, then, sir.  All right, then.  Fair enough.  I would have been all over that fucking eagle.  I would have put on my fucking, my cotton bunny outfit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Would you go out there, Jimmy? 
[03:17:00]  No.  Vaseline shoes got me.  Vaseline shoes.  You think of, like, how slippery that is?  Yeah.  Walking out there, and then having someone shoot you with a paintball gun.  I would just take the paintball fucking bullets.  Of course, you'd have to.  Just imagine the thought that would go through your head as you realize you're slipping.  What a mistake the whole thing was.  The whole thing was a big error in judgment.  If I just, 30 seconds ago, not done this, I wouldn't be slipping and dying right now.  Oh, you'd have to wake up from the nightmare.  And you'd fall down and be thinking of all the fun shit you're missing out on. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, like, how stupid was that just now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'd be thinking of all the people you owe money to, and you'd fucking feel good about it.  Ha ha.  You'd get nothing.  Let me give Moses the big plug, because he's responsible for all that.  He took me around.  He was very cool.  His name's Moses Gates.  His book is going to be called, it is called, but it's not out yet officially, Hidden Cities.  He's MosesNYC on Twitter, and he'll be doing our show, I believe, on the 25th. 
[03:18:00]  I think it's the day.  The name of Moses shall not be spoken.  So.  Hmm.  I forgot him.  Good.  And I had a chance to be friends with him.  I've decided I can't be friends with him.  No, it's crazy.  I mean, you know, nothing against him.  He's a cool guy, but yeah.  He would get me into crazy shit.  Mm-hmm.  Eventually.  You're a father of two.  I'll hang with him every once in a while.  You can't be doing stuff like that.  Oh my God, no.  It's crazy. 
[03:18:30]  Dude, it was a whole day that started at maybe noon and went to about 7 o'clock at night.  The entire time, I'm like, all right, when do I officially get arrested?  Did you have to pee the whole time from nerves?  Um, I don't even remember peeing.  I get nervous.  I have to go pee-pee.  Yeah, me too.  I go make pee-pees.  I piss in shit like a bird, and there's a hole that opens up under my scrotum.  I'm pissed.  Just that white shit comes out.  But I get really nervous, and I can't do it unless there's a windshield under me. 
[03:19:00]  It's a bird humor.  Of course.  It's hilarious.  That's how I feel.  It's in Toledo.  Which, speaking of which, we got to go, because we got to get Jimmy and Kenny on the road.  Yep.  They're heading to the airport.  Toledo, make sure you see Jimmy.  Bay of Paulette.  It's in where, actually, Jimmy?  Perrysburg, Ohio.  Perrysburg, Ohio.  Come on out and see Jimmy.  It's not that far from Detroit, either.  Yeah, it's about an hour or not.  All right.  All right.  That sounds good.  All right.  I'll see you guys Monday.  AD do.  Hang on one sec.  What?  Read this. 
[03:19:30]  I can't.  I've got to make wee-wee.  You can read this.  You're reading your phone right now.  Jimmy's going to read it.  Jimmy's going to read it.  Oh.

[03:20:30]  Thirsty Thursday.  We've got a couple O.P. Sudoku puzzles.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  I haven't given them out in a while because we've been busy.  But I've got today's and yesterday's.  Eric, do you have an O.P. Sudoku puzzle for a prize in your collection of memorabilia?  That I do not.  You want one?  No, I'm good.  All right.  You would have wanted one at a time.  There was a time when you would have wanted one.  There was a time when I would have wanted one.  Yeah.  You know?  Frame that shit. 
[03:21:00]  Back in the long, long ago.  Back in the long, long ago, indeed.  But O.P. has pulled it off.  He's figured out how to not only do a radio show but complete a full Sudoku puzzle.  So, if you want O.P. Sudoku puzzles, they're here for the taking.  I was delighted when I woke up this morning because I didn't see it last night to see that  Fandango and O.P. were Twitter buddies now.  Yeah.  I don't know how exactly.  I'm assuming that it's because a lot of our fans tweeted him, the wrestler, Fandango, who  doesn't wrestle unless you pronounce his name right and claims that nobody has yet so he 
[03:21:30]  won't wrestle.  So, I'm assuming a lot of our fans tweeted him saying, you know, O.P.'s been talking  about you, blah, blah, blah.  But I know that I have specifically gone and spoken to a bunch of people who work at WWE  trying to spread the word that Fandango is the show's new obsession.  Yeah.  Because it's been a while since there was a big, since anything to do with professional  wrestling was involved in the show. 
[03:22:00]  So, the fact that it's not only involved in the show so heavily but it's new is something.  But I talked to someone yesterday and he said that he and Billy Gunn, a.k.a. Mr. Ass,  were having a conversation about how Fandango keeps getting mentioned on the Opie and Anthony  show.  And I go, well, did you tell him we play his theme song all the time?  And he goes, no, I didn't, I didn't know you, what?  Nobody knows we've been playing Mr. Ass for how many years? 
[03:22:30]  I go, it's a regular thing, we play Mr. Ass' theme song literally.  I kept cutting Opie off the other day with his Pop-Tarts story because I didn't want to  turn Mr. Ass off.  Where else have people heard all three verses?  Three verses to that song.  So hopefully, hopefully, word is going to start getting back to Mr. Ass because I had  no idea that people didn't know that we were doing that.  That it wasn't kind of common knowledge by this point. 
[03:23:00]  But I have told people who talk to Mr. Ass.  I myself don't talk to him.  Does Vince know that Anthony does him?  I would hope so.  Anthony does one of the best Vince McMahon's there is.  Let me talk to Derek in Kentucky.  What's up, Derek?  Hey, how are you today?  I can't understand what you're saying.  Is your phone stuck?  Yeah, I'm probably.  Yeah, your phone stuck.  Sorry, buddy.  John in Chicago.  What's up, gentlemen?  How are you today?  Good.  That's cool.  Hey, listen, quick question for you.  What do you think about the upcoming WrestleMania card and what are your predictions? 
[03:23:30]  I think they need to get it fired up a little more.  I'm not that excited, you know?  Totally.  I totally agree.  And The Undertaker, does he lose to Punk?  That's the question.  Well, the real question.  Because now, you know, for those that don't know, CM Punk, he's a friend of the show.  They're giving him The Undertaker match this year.  The Undertaker always wins at WrestleMania.  The question is, is The Undertaker finished?  Because if he's done wrestling, then, you know, he'll lose, hopefully. 
[03:24:00]  Because, you know, it makes sense.  But if he's not, then I don't know.  Maybe Stone Cold.  Right.  Maybe Stone Cold comes in and starts whipping ass and sets up for next year.  I don't know.  I don't know for sure.  It would be great.  You want a Sudoku puzzle?  I would love a Sudoku puzzle.  Thank you.  All right, John.  Hold on.  You just won yourself.  A Sudoku puzzle.  Hang on the line for John.  Let's do What Did You Learns.  Ryan in Saskatchewan, do you have a What Did You Learn? 
[03:24:30]  I will in about three days because I'm an Audible subscriber.  I can't give it to you, though, dude.  Can't give it to you, then.  Is this my buddy from Kentucky?  It is, Sam.  Sorry about that.  That's okay.  What did you learn?  I learned today that the tickets today for the Jim Norton show in Perrysburg, Ohio, are  still available.  That works as a What Did You Learn.  Very good.  You want a Sudoku?  I would love one.  All right.  There it goes.  The second Opie Sudoku puzzle.  And by the way... 
[03:25:00]  Is it just two that you have?  Yeah, it's just the two.  But people should still call in for What Did You Learns.  Yeah, put those...  Put them on hold.  The videos that Opie was talking about are up on his YouTube channel, at Opie Radio.  They're on our Facebook, too.  Oh, okay.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Those are the freakiest things I've seen.  And I think I might be just as freaked out about the latter one.  There's something about, like, looking up or looking down whichever direction you're  in, and just seeing nothingness but ladders and no people and the potential to fall a 
[03:25:30]  long way.  It just...  It freaks me out.  So you can't do a ladder match?  I can't do a ladder match for various reasons, Eric.  One is I don't like climbing ladders.  Even if it's for the title?  Well, it depends on which title.  9-2-0.  You're on the show.  Sam, who in the hell was screaming phone calls this morning?  I don't know.  Who is it, Eric?  That would be Sal.  For the main show you're talking about?  For the main show, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, why?  What was going on with Sal today? 
[03:26:00]  I thought the guy, he just...  He is such a lackluster addition to anything.  Even phone screening.  Yeah, but he just picks up.  Oh, and you can hardly hear what he's saying.  He doesn't ask your name, where you're from.  And it's like you're just supposed to belt something off to get him to fucking, you  know, think you're worthy of it.  Are you in there with Sal, Eric?  During the show, yes.  Is this true?  Does Sal just pick up and go, oh, and I...  I don't hear much of how Sal handles the phones. 
[03:26:30]  Where is he?  I think he's in the back doing something.  Well, he's got to pick up his energy.  Thank you, sir.  He's got to pick up his energy.  Come in here, Sal, if you're listening, because I got to know.  He's got to pick up his energy, because if he doesn't have energy as the call screener,  how do you expect the listeners to have any energy, right?  Pete?  Hey, today I learned that Detroit, Buffalo, and Atlanta used to be prominent cities, but  not so much anymore.  Yeah, they were cities that rose to prominence, and now Sal is just lingering down the hall. 
[03:27:00]  He's just slowly walking like we have nothing better to do.  Why are you giving the callers no energy when they call in?  I'm giving them no energy?  He called in and said that you picked up the phone.  Yeah, I heard the guy.  And you just go, O&A.  O&A, yeah, because then half the time, if I say O&A name, they just start telling the  story immediately.  So I let them do either or, and then I assess it, because it gets the call done quicker.  No, you got to go, O&A, who's this?  What do you got?  Because when you say, O&A, who's this?  They say, yeah, uh... 
[03:27:30]  So it's just easier to let them make the decision of what they want to tell me, what their  name is first.  No, no, no, Sal.  You make the decisions.  You're in charge here.  You're the boss.  There's absolutely no way of fighting with the callers.  There's no winning whatsoever.  That's the problem.  You know, like the whole...  You're trying to fight with them.  I'm not trying to fight with them.  You just said there's no...  You shouldn't be fighting with them.  I'm not fighting with them.  I'm saying there's no way to fight to go against what they're going to do.  They're going to do what they're going to do regardless.  Well, with weak leadership, they will. 
[03:28:00]  Snowy in Michigan.  Hey, Sammy.  How you doing today, sir?  Good.  I'm great, Snowy.  Yep.  Very horrible.  It's the radio business.  Okay, buddy.  I learned that Calvin Quinn is a big fan of Neal Sadaka's song, Bad Blood.  That was yesterday, but you still learned it.  It counts, right?  I don't.  I didn't know it was yesterday.  That was yesterday, wasn't it, Eric?  Yeah, it was yesterday.  I'm on show for a couple days, Sammy.  I didn't have a chance to listen to the show for a couple days.  These days blend together, don't they, Snowy?  Well, especially when I'm not in my truck getting it fixed.  It's freaking broke down down here. 
[03:28:30]  You're dangerous behind that wheel.  Fontaine.  Hey, buddy.  What's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, do you know who the best phone screener was back in the day?  It was Travis.  That dude was all right.  He was a good phone screener.  Hell yeah.  When I called in, he would automatically pop up my MySpace page.  He would know.  He would know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, I got a What Do You Learn?  Yeah.  What's your name?  And usually you can pull just about anything out of the show and make up a What Do You Learn?  But today I really did learn that Stephen Lynch is the result of a priest fucking a nun. 
[03:29:00]  Holy shit.  And I didn't know about that either.  I didn't know about that either.  That's very strange.  Did you know that, Eric?  I had no idea.  I guess.  Obie said they talked about it on the show.  It must have been a very long time ago.  I'm wondering if that is true.  Because Stephen likes to tell a lot of stories.  Oh, like he just makes shit up because it's funny sometimes?  And maybe he said it early on in their relationship so they just believed it.  Oh.  Like before you understood that the show is about telling just what's going on? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, usually if your parents are a priest that had a baby with a nun, it would usually be like a horror movie.  Like they're the devil child.  Right, right, right, right.  Oh, boy.  Rick.  Yeah, Sal's a fucking joke on the phones, man.  That other caller was right.  All he does is, ONA, and that's it.  That's all you fucking hear.  Wow.  Wow.  Let me go to Jay.  What's up, Jay?  Yeah, I had something funny to say and he hung up on me.  What?  What was it?  Tell me what it was.  You guys were talking about who was the leader of the Catholic Church, who was the leader of the Muslims. 
[03:30:00]  I said, you know, the leader of the water buffaloes was a grand poobah.  Yeah, throw it up.  Why not, right?  Flintstones reference.  Right.  Right.  And we're talking about the Flintstones.  And he hung up in the middle of it.  And I just felt like, you know, he does it a couple of times already.  Jay, I don't want you to feel bad because of that, okay?  Jay, I don't want you to think that because maybe Sal is not the greatest phone screener  we've ever had that makes you any less of a human being.  I appreciate that very much, Sam. 
[03:30:30]  You're the man, bro.  You are the man, Jay.  No matter what Sal says.  I got a quick question for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Whenever I listen to the radio, you know, you get a mental picture of sometimes if you don't  see the people.  Right.  Doesn't Club Soda Kenny sort of seem like, you know, that guy from Ghost, the weird, weird  guy on the train?  Patrick Swayze?  Yeah, I've always gotten that sort of, like, when I hear, I know what Club Soda Kenny looks  like, but like when I hear him on the radio, I'm just thinking of like Patrick Swayze and  the hair is blowing. 
[03:31:00]  And yeah, I totally get you, Jay.  I'm not.  All right.  I'll talk to you later, buddy.  Definitely get a Patrick Swayze vibe.  Have you gotten that too, Eric?  Kenny is a hell of a dancer.  He is.  He's a good dancer.  He's a good looking guy.  He's in great shape.  You must have been in heaven today with all the cartoon talk.  Cartoon talk?  Fandango talk?  Now.  It was great.  Do you like the cartoon talk when it's old school cartoons or are you just like?  I like certain old school cartoons.  There's a lot of old school cartoons that were just complete garbage.  Like what's garbage? 
[03:31:30]  Tennessee Tuxedo.  What is that?  It was, remember, what was his name?  The guy from Get Smart.  Don.  I don't know.  I'm forgetting his name.  But sure, I know the show.  He voiced the cartoon.  He was a penguin who had a sidekick that was a walrus and they would like solve mysteries  and things like that.  So it was like Get Smart except with sea animals.  Yeah.  It was an old school 60s into the 70s cartoon.  It might be like a Hanna-Barbera or something like that.  But things along those lines just weren't funny. 
[03:32:00]  And that was garbage.  Yeah.  But if you, like Anthony says, Looney Tunes were really good.  Rocky and Bullwinkle, which is an older series.  You love Rocky and Bullwinkle.  It's very funny.  You watch it now.  I would watch it if it was on, yeah.  But it's not in your DVD collection?  No, I don't own it yet.  Yes.  You should.  Working on it.  I remember I got you a Looney Tunes DVD for Christmas one year.  You actually sit there and watch?  It was in addition to, yeah, because it was this, what was it, the Golden Series.  I don't know.  I found it on your Amazon list.  There was no thought put into it. 
[03:32:30]  I know.  But it was appreciated.  I was like, oh, I did the work for myself.  Exactly.  Exactly.  What's going on, Roland?  Rex Brown was late.  Huh?  Rex Brown was late.  Who's Rex Brown?  I don't know.  Some singer from the group called Pantera.  Oh, oh, oh, the bassist for Pantera.  Yeah.  I mean, the singer for Pantera probably didn't, you know.  I don't know these groups.  Yeah.  You don't know Pantera?  No.  They're kind of big.  But I know.  Dimebag Daryl? 
[03:33:00]  Big story.  He's dead.  He's dead.  Yeah, he's very dead.  He was shot on stage.  There's people around here who still mourn it.  Yeah.  That's why I didn't want to mention it.  I don't want Jose to start crying somewhere.  Fuck him.  Fuck Dimebag Daryl.  What's wrong with you?  Why are you so upset?  Don't say that.  Don't say fuck Dimebag Daryl.  There's a big cardboard cutout of a dumb hole.  And then Jimmy had to fly, and then Jimmy had to fly, and let's just say.  Let's just say what?  It's very stressful. 
[03:33:30]  Oh.  It's like, where the fuck are you?  That's still, you don't need to disgrace.  Do you know who comes on time every time?  Who?  Mr. Blake Shelton.  He's never been here.  I've never seen him here.  He's been here, but not on our shows.  All right, then.  He's never been here on the channel.  Soon.  You're working on that.  Oh, very soon.  What time is he going to get here?  I'll buy you lunch soon.  We'll talk later.  That's Roland's Honeybee.  Kevin in Mineola. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, Lynch's parents were.  The father was dropped out of the seminary, and the mother was a former nun.  You jackass brillo head.  Why are you insulting me?  Because I don't know who Stephen Lynch's parents are.  Thanks, Jerky Boy.  Yeah, he is.  He's a little Frank Rizzo, isn't he?  Yeah.  I used to have a Jerky Boy's tape.  I remember when I bought the Jerky Boy.  You had to have the Jerky Boy's tape.  Because it was hilarious when it came out, but I was a kid when it came out, and so  I remember going to Sam Goody and buying the Jerky Boy's on cassette.  Sam Goody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And buying the Jerky Boy's on cassette. 
[03:34:30]  Goody got it.  And my mother took it away from me and hid it in her drawer for years.  She wanted to listen to it?  No, she didn't want to listen to it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can bring him on in.  She loved the Egyptian magician?  Yeah.  Hi, honey.  Come on in.  Of course I have guests.  Moshe.  This is a big show.  Hi, how are you?  Welcome, Natasha.  Hi.  How are you?  Sit down.  How are you, sir?  Good.  Nice to see you.  How's it going?  Tell me how to pronounce your name.  Moshe?  Moshe.  Moshe.  Moshe.  Moshe Kasher.  Moshe Kasher.  Yep.  Moshe Kasher, Natasha Leggero, Caroline's this weekend. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  It's an exciting time.  You picked a good time to come to New York, too, because you avoided the soda ban, you  know?  Yeah.  So what about that St. Patrick's Day harangue that's going to be happening?  Oh, it is this weekend, isn't it?  Scared.  Yeah.  You're going to be here while the parade's going on.  Do you celebrate St. Patrick's Day, either of you?  No, I'm a Jew, so I specifically don't celebrate St. Patrick's Day.  You're anti.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Any Catholic leader who has green beer, I'm not in. 
[03:35:30]  Right.  You don't want it.  What about you, Natasha?  I was raised Catholic.  I guess you could consider me a lapsed Catholic.  You have lapsed.  Yes.  So are you excited about the Pope or not so much?  I could give a shit about the Pope.  Right.  I'm in, man.  I'm in.  But you're excited about the Pope.  I will not celebrate St. Patrick's Day, but I do worship our new papal leader.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm very happy about him.  It's very strange that they put, like, this guy quits, and you're not supposed to  quit the Pope-dom, you know?  And then they put in, how old, the new guy's 76 years old. 
[03:36:00]  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  He's 76, and he's got one lung.  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  He's got one lung.  Does he have an iron lung that he hangs out in his day?  Yeah.  The Vatican is an iron lung.  Like those old East Side socialites?  They just pushed him out.  Hello.  No.  I want an iron lung.  He's only got one lung in his body.  That's crazy.  Like, naturally, or he had one taken out?  I think they said when he was a teenager, he had his lung taken out.  Damn.  That's a real gangster Pope.  I guess so, but he's all...  Yeah, I got shot in the lung, dog. 
[03:36:30]  How do you just have one lung?  I don't know.  I thought it was necessary.  I didn't know they were, like, kidneys that you could...  Yeah, I have two lungs.  You can have one.  Did you hear about the fact that they found out that the largest gay bathhouse in Rome  is in a building that is owned by the Vatican?  Really?  Yes, that's for real.  And there was a cardinal or a bishop or whatever the high level is living in the building.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, it's like, oh, I wonder why, you know?  But it's good, actually, because you're allowed to take confession orally, apparently. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, good news.  Is that right?  Yeah.  I was saying the only thing that's gayer than a gay bathhouse is announcing your new leader  in plumes of white smoke.  I don't think you're...  I mean, but then the Pope comes out.  This Pope is also, I think, very anti-homosexuality and gay marriage.  Oh, this Pope isn't one of the pro-gay Pops?  No, no.  They went to the Cardinals, and they did not find that this Pope was pro-gay.  But I was just...  They didn't take the black guy.  That would have been cool.  A black Pope?  A black Pope would have been so good. 
[03:37:30]  There's sort of nothing...  A black Pope would be dope.  Right.  A black Pope dope.  He would have named himself Pope Dope, for sure.  There was nothing noteworthy about it, though.  It was just like, oh, it's an old white guy.  I guess because he's from South America.  That's something, right?  No.  No.  I mean, I didn't know where the others were from.  I just knew that they didn't speak English well.  There was an American.  Wasn't the New York guy, supposedly, in the mix?  He was in the mix, but they were like...  They said that they would never give it to an American, because we already have too much  power. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, right.  So they can't give us Catholicism, too.  So how many years does this, like, one long Pope have left?  I wouldn't think very many.  Like four?  Like, he's still, when he gets out there, he seems like a Pope that's on his last legs.  And this is first day.  Does a Pope have to be old?  Like, what if they just got, like, a strapping, like, handsome man?  They should.  They don't have to be anything.  Apparently, you don't even need to elect somebody from within the Catholic Church.  I mean, they have to be Catholic, but you don't have to elect a cardinal.  You don't?  No, apparently not.  Apparently, they have to be Catholic. 
[03:38:30]  Like, they used to, back in the day, they used to elect, like, they would elect, like,  a powerful kind of leader, you know, maybe a royal type of person to kind of consolidate  power.  But now, now it's all, you know...  But what about, like, Natasha's a lapsed Catholic?  Could she be Pope?  Could she be...  I don't think any woman can be Pope.  Pope Natasha?  So women can't be Popes?  I doubt it.  I mean, they can't be priests.  They probably can't be Popes.  The Catholic religion is very misogynistic.  Really?  And very, uh...  Is this new?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought... 
[03:39:00]  Hold up.  I thought Catholicism has been very accepting and sort of...  It is...  I mean, it's, it's like, I think it might be the worst religion.  Come on.  Worse than Scientology.  I feel bad for Scientologists because, like, people that look at Scientologists, like, these  people are out of their minds.  Like, listen to these stories.  This can't be real.  It's like aliens and stuff.  But you go...  You don't believe in Theitans?  It's just because it's new.  Do that?  Like, it's no more ridiculous than Jesus lives in the sky and helps people. 
[03:39:30]  That's true.  And Mormon is pretty new, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I went to the headquarters in L.A. of the Scientology headquarters, and it's crazy.  They, apparently, they don't give a fuck about the way people think about them because the  interior design theme was literally, if you went to a designer and were like, I'd like  you to make something reminiscent of a cult headquarters.  If you could maybe design it specifically to look scary, like they're all wearing turtlenecks.  Every one of them has a turtleneck on.  Matching white sneakers.  It's not a joke. 
[03:40:00]  It's very bizarre.  I was there, too.  I took a personality test.  Oh, and yeah.  I took it, too.  You did?  I think everybody does that when they move to L.A.  Oh.  They go, they go, personality tests.  It's like, it's like...  There he is.  That's the new Pope.  The Pope's on TV right now.  Right.  He looked good, though.  He looks sexy, though.  He looks very lucid.  Yeah, I mean, he looks good.  And having one lung.  Yeah, he doesn't look one lung, that's for sure.  No, you never can...  Once he takes his shirt off, it's a mess, but, you know, once he...  So, Pope's can't have sex.  Is that right?  No way.  I wouldn't think so. 
[03:40:30]  They're like priests.  Yeah.  Okay.  Right.  Priests never have sex.  No, well...  Not with women.  Right.  So, you got personality tests?  Oh, yeah.  Both of you done?  It's funny.  All of it's...  Everything is the same.  They go, here's...  They show you a line.  They go, here's normal, and here's where you are.  Oh, whoops.  It looks like you're totally below normal on every single part of your personality.  But good news, there's something that can help.  Can anybody guess what that is?  Um, uh, no.  I mean, what could it be?  It's Scientology.  Oh, fantastic.  I'm here already.  It does cost some money. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, wow.  But it is pretty creepy, because you realize to fall for it, you have to be so desperate.  Really?  Well, because it doesn't make sense.  Mm-hmm.  Like, when I did my personality test, the man was like...  Because I gave him a fake name, and he's like, Amber.  Amber.  And Amber is the fake name, too.  It's like the number one used fake name.  Is it?  Nobody's named Amber.  But if you had said your name is Amber, and he had looked at you, cocked his eyebrow, adjusted  his turtleneck, and said, your name is not Amber, would you have converted?  I would have been a little more impressed. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  But he was like, Amber, do you read a lot of books?  And I was like, why?  He's like, you got a very high score.  But I got a high score, because it's so obvious what the answers are, and what they're trying  to manipulate you into doing.  One of them readers?  What do you...  What do you...  It was pretty rough.  I've just felt so bad for the people.  Well, I'd just like to say, if there are any fans listening that are Catholic or Scientologists,  I think both religions are great.  You love all religions.  I would love whatever religion my fans are, I think is the best one. 
[03:42:00]  I mean, let's be honest, Judaism is just as wacky as the rest of them.  Everything's wacky.  Right, right.  The whole thing is crazy.  But Judaism is like, I think it's a little more...  It does feel...  Racially pure.  Well...  Which is nice.  Always good.  But it does seem superior in the sense that the leaders, the rabbis, they can have sex.  It's like, why try to repress people into not having sex and suppressing this natural  instinct, and then all of a sudden they start...  How many rabbis do you know who fuck little boys?  Honestly, I can't see any negative blowback from a chastity fan. 
[03:42:30]  I can't see how that could go wrong.  You can't.  I mean, I guess they did do the sex with boys.  But you hear about weird rabbis.  Like, there's that one rabbi who is like...  It's nowhere near as many as, like, the priests, though.  No, no.  I mean, every week.  It's an epidemic.  It is bad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, the rabbis, it's like once every, like, five years, some rabbi is, like, sucking  off babies when he's circumcising.  Yeah, that's the Jubilee year in the Bible.  Yeah.  Once every five years, you've got to suck off a baby.  Yeah.  Hopefully the baby's name is Jubilee. 
[03:43:00]  So are you, like, uh...  Are you very religious?  Do you practice your Judaism?  Or are you lapsing?  I mean, I have a lot of money, if that's what you mean.  Yeah.  I do count coins and swim in them like Scrooge McDuck, if that is what you mean.  Do you have a lot of industry friends?  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, sure, sure, sure.  I run a couple magazines.  Okay.  Jet Magazine, Ebony.  I got all the black ones for some reason, but they give them out.  You know, there's a meeting.  Oh.  There's an annual kind of media meeting.  Right, right, right.  And you get a magazine or whatever, and I got pretty lucky this year.  I got Ebony and Michelle Obama was on the cover, so that's good. 
[03:43:30]  That's great.  That's great.  You can't do better.  I'm not anti-religion.  I actually have a degree in religion, so I kind of like them all.  Theology?  Well, no, like religious studies, like comparative religion.  But I do some Jew stuff.  You know, I don't eat bacon.  And that's probably...  No, that's because I'm a Jew.  It is.  I don't eat pork.  I don't eat shrimp.  I miss shrimp.  Have you tried bacon?  I have.  Yeah, it's good.  I get it.  It's delicious.  I had it.  Literally, I had it this morning.  No, it's very good.  Yeah, you should rethink that.  I should get back into it.  But it is a swine. 
[03:44:00]  I guess, but it's delicious.  I mean, I don't know what that even means.  It means it's a swine.  Think about it.  Is that bad?  Like, isn't...  Well, think about what it does.  It just rolls around in shit.  But it's not like cows are hygienic animals.  I mean, chickens also roll around in shit.  That is true.  Like, have you ever...  Meat is pretty nasty.  I guess, but it's delicious.  It is good.  Like, what's better than bacon and chicken wings?  I guess...  Vegetables?  No.  Not burning in hell.  I guess so.  Yeah.  Depending.  Depending on where you go.  You know, there's bacon in heaven. 
[03:44:30]  So you forgo it on this earth.  Oh, is that what they tell you?  So when you get to heaven, you get bacon.  There's a lot of buffets.  Basically, you know the hometown buffet?  Yeah.  That's Jewish heaven.  Oh, really?  Like a cracker barrel.  It's free.  You just keep going back and keep going back.  So when you went out for Scientology, did you just go as an adventure?  Like, I gotta just go.  They give personality tests to whoever.  I was on a date.  I thought you did it.  I was on a date, too.  Really?  It was, yeah.  And you're like, this is what we should do?  Well, because they play that movie, Psychology Kills. 
[03:45:00]  Like, well, there's an exhibit there, an art exhibit for all of you cultured people called  Psychology Kills the Exhibit.  And so they have that.  And then they also have a movie that they play, like, every 45 minutes.  Oh, so you just get to, like, one of those Disney movies where it's like, nobody's really  there, but you just walk in and it's always playing.  Yeah, and they talk about the cruise.  They have a cruise that, like, if you're on a high level.  Well, Tom Cruise does go on that cruise, but it is some kind of cruise that you get  to go on if you're on that high level.  Oh, right. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  So, like, everybody else is fighting to get into heaven and Scientologists are like,  I gotta get tickets to that cruise, to be honest.  It's a funny name.  I'm gonna try to find it.  Well, a cruise is a more realistic heaven than heaven heaven, right?  I mean, at least cruises do exist.  I would have an easier time believing I'm going to get on a cruise if I behave myself  than I'm going to get into heaven.  No, it's like the end result, because there's different tiers of Scientology.  And then to get into this, I'm trying to think of what the name of it is.  It has a funny name.  But yeah, so people try to get in that cruise, but they try to tempt you with it at this movie. 
[03:46:00]  I bet they know what they're doing.  Like, I bet they know that people like you go knowing that you're just going to make  a mockery of it.  But they're aware that there's a percentage of people that go in there and make a mockery  of it and go, you know, this kind of makes some sense, actually.  I'm sure you're right.  I gotta check this out a little bit.  But that's what I was saying.  I was impressed with how unabashed they were about their design theme.  Like, it wasn't, it was, see, if I was Scientology, I would think, you know, people are all  making fun of us.  They all think we're cult.  Well, let's make the inside of this, like, a funky bohemian coffee shop, you know, maybe 
[03:46:30]  trick them into, no, they did not, no.  There was a office of L. Ron Hubbard's office, untouched, that was, like, roped off, and his,  like, shoes were on the desk, and they're, like, waiting for him to return.  I mean, they didn't care.  Right.  So it says, the Scientology, the highest level, which is O-T-V-1-1-1.  That sounds like a strain of HIV.  No, so it's only disclosed, the highest level of Scientology is only disclosed at sea. 
[03:47:00]  Damn.  On the Scientology cruise ship called Free Winds.  Free Winds.  Yeah, so you've got to get on this ship, and that's what the movie tells you about.  Like, if you can stay with it for long enough, they will disclose to you all their secrets.  And you know what it is?  It's four o'clock shuffleboard.  That's the secret.  There it is.  Yeah, that's all you need.  And everybody's included.  We have plenty of shuffleboard for everybody.  But it all seems like, but then you realize that, like, Will Smith and Tom Cruise and John  Travolta, and, like, they're full-fledged. 
[03:47:30]  Will Smith bothered me the most.  How about Beck?  I think because he's black.  Beck is a Scientologist?  You know who I read was a Scientologist today that just bothered me?  Giobani Ribisi.  Oh, really?  His mother is a casting director, and they run a Scientology, like, acting situation for  the actors.  I feel like Boiler Room was so good that he should be able to be like, this is too strange  to exist.  Am I the only one that feels, though, that black people should know better?  Like, they should just be... 
[03:48:00]  I feel like the savviness should be hot.  Like, I just feel like they...  I'm black.  Right.  I'm black.  Like, my ancestors have been through all this bullshit.  You're not going to trick us again.  And we've been through the ringer.  I'm the fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  I was raised in West Philadelphia.  Right.  Born also.  Also born there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's where I spent most of my days, anyway.  Yeah, well, you'd think.  And you'd think, like, he knows the...  But that's why, like, Will Smith, Tom Cruise, these are guys that could control the world  if they wanted to, because they make millions of dollars every time they put out a movie. 
[03:48:30]  But they just attach themselves to Scientology.  Well, have you ever seen this video?  There's a video online of, um, uh, what's her name?  Will Smith's wife?  Uh, Jada Pinkett.  Jada Pinkett Smith.  And the little girl, Willow, or whatever.  And they're talking.  It's like, this is what happens when people get too rich.  They start to disassociate with reality.  Because they're like, it's her, Jada Pinkett, her mom, so the grandma, and Willow's talking.  And they're just, like, worshipping every word she says.  They're like, so what do you think life is? 
[03:49:00]  Well, I think...  Willow's saying this?  Willow's like, life is, life is, is good, but it's also hard.  And like, ooh, ooh, listen to her, the wisdom from her.  It's like, there's no fucking wisdom there.  Yeah, she's so confident.  Yeah.  I heard an interview with her, and she's like, I get my flow from my dad.  And I'm like, no one ever told me I got, I had a flow.  I get my flow from my dad, but unfortunately he was a deaf Jew, so there's not a lot of flow there.  That's great.  This is the same Willow Smith that whipped her hair back and forth and did all that, right? 
[03:49:30]  That's the same, yeah, who had a hit at 12.  Right, and she's the one who's kind of giving her perspective on...  On life and theology.  And Jada Pinkett is...  Woo, child!  Oh, the wisdom from this child's lips to God's ears.  Let's go to Kevin in Houston.  You're on with Moshe Kasher?  Kasher.  Kasher.  You have a very hard-to-pronounce name.  Well, you know, I have some fans that know how to pronounce it.  Moshe Kasher and Natasha Leggero.  They're going to be at Caroline's all weekend, by the way.  What's up, Kevin?  Hey, guys, how y'all doing?  Hey, I downloaded that book. 
[03:50:00]  I can't remember the girl's name.  She was on the show a couple months back.  Oh, you remember the...  Yeah, the...  The...  Hubbard or whoever it was that left...  The girl who left Scientology.  Like, her uncle was one of the higher-up muckety-muck people.  Yeah.  I highly suggest anybody, if you want to learn how fucking goofy that religion is, to download  that book.  I mean, it made me physically mad reading, like, some of the shit they believe in, which  is fine if they want to believe that.  That's their deal. 
[03:50:30]  But it goes back to the point with stupid Bloomberg and his soda fan.  Really?  All it is, is about power.  These people have so much goddamn money, it's just power.  They just want to control people.  Ooh, child!  The wisdom from Yoli, man!  It's probably right, though.  But I get the same weird-out feeling when, like, Stephen Baldwin starts talking about Jesus  and stuff like that.  For sure.  When he goes on, it's the same...  I mean, whenever there's something powerful, everybody wants to control it.  Yeah.  And, I mean, Scientology, I don't know how... 
[03:51:00]  I mean, I think it just has money attached to it.  I just think any extremism of any form at all, no matter religion, politics, sodas, whatever,  I don't want to talk to you.  Well, that's what Ferris Bueller said, isn't it?  Is that right?  He said he didn't believe in isms.  Moshe is always quoting Ferris Bueller.  That's what I thought.  That's what I read.  Speaking of how difficult it is to pronounce my name, I worked with the late, great Patrice  O'Neill a long time ago.  Oh, you did?  And I was opening for him, and he gets on stage, and he goes, Moshe Kasher, your name 
[03:51:30]  might as well be Jewish Jewish.  A lot of...  Every comedian who worked with Patrice has a story.  There are still comedians to this day who haven't gotten over how much...  How badly he hurt their feelings.  Like, they hate...  He treated me with kid gloves, I think.  He did?  Everybody was warning me.  They were like, Patrice, it's an asshole.  Beware.  And we went out to Chinese food and crab, and I was worshipful of that guy.  So maybe that's why. 
[03:52:00]  I was just like, hi, sir.  He picked up on it, and he was like, okay, you kissed the rings.  Okay, there you go.  Yeah.  Did you ever meet Patrice?  No, Moshe just recently.  I had never seen him, because...  Oh, really?  I don't know.  I never saw him in L.A.  Yeah.  He wasn't in L.A. much.  It wasn't...  Yeah.  The real shame about Patrice...  He was great.  Yeah.  I mean, what he just showed me was...  It's so good.  It was very, like, in the moment.  But the real shame about Patrice now that he's passed away is, like, the elephant in the  room was amazing.  Yeah.  But the real magic of that guy was seeing him live. 
[03:52:30]  I mean, there was some...  He was able to...  You can tell.  He was able to do things, like, where women, feminist women, would be like, we do suck.  You're right.  Yeah.  There was something amazing about it.  There's that great viral clip that went on when he was on Fox News.  Oh, yeah.  Have you seen the video?  It's all over YouTube.  It's got...  I'm on the side of funny.  Was that the one?  Yes, exactly.  But that's when he starts, like, bringing stuff up that this feminist woman should be offended  by, but he gets the cameraman to start laughing.  And then he starts going, why are you laughing?  She's offended! 
[03:53:00]  That was his last appearance on Fox News.  It was memorable.  Let's go to Jason in Minnesota.  What's up, Jason?  What's going on, Primetime?  Scientology, you've got to check out a website called Operation Clambake.  Clambake?  Sounds legit.  Operation Clambake.  It's got all sorts of inside information on that crazy-ass religion.  Operation Clambake.  I don't know.  I don't know if I can get behind anybody blindly going to Operation Clambake. 
[03:53:30]  It sounds like a meat spin type of website.  I love the idea.  You go up to somebody, you're like, this is a bullshit religion.  It's filled with nonsense, illegitimate information.  Go to my website, www.clambake.com.  I was like, no thanks.  Trust me.  I know.  You guys are going to be at Caroline's all weekend, except Moshe.  How come you're not going to be there on Sunday?  Yeah, Moshe.  I know.  He's leaving me alone to do St. Patrick's Day.  Oh, that's brutal.  In New York.  In Times Square.  That's horrible. 
[03:54:00]  All those guys, those just like bros.  It's like bro heaven, St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah.  With those light blue Oxford shirts, and their green beer, and their things on their heads,  just screaming in the subways.  Natasha's not going to make it out alive.  Last time I was here in St. Patrick's Day, I was in a subway, and people were like closing  the doors, like not letting you open, like these brutes, like just this new thing was  coming out of them.  Yeah.  Like they were physically closing the doors and stuff.  Yeah, like everyone was just screaming and grunting. 
[03:54:30]  I'm terrified.  And you know what's all around Caroline's?  Bars.  Oh, yeah.  Places that serve alcohol.  Moshe, why can't you come on Sunday?  Well, I got cast in a major Hollywood pilot.  Whoa!  I can't make it.  I'm so sorry.  You can't do it.  Yeah, I'm doing a pilot called Operation Clambake.  It's supposed to be really good.  Yeah, no, I'm doing, I got cast in a show, and so I'm going back to tape the pilot, and  I'm excited about it.  And Natasha won't be happy for me.  She'll only get mad at me for not being there to support her.  Right.  Well, I can handle it.  And then she'll get bitter every time the show gets picked up. 
[03:55:00]  Every single episode, that fucking asshole.  Do you remember St. Patrick's Day?  That was when I lost my lung.  Do you like, Natasha, you like performing for bros?  Do you think dudes, are they a tougher audience, or are you?  I mean, I would say the bro is my natural enemy.  Yeah?  You think so?  So, no.  No.  On the bro?  Mm-mm.  But, um, you know, if you can get them to submit, it can be, it can be okay. 
[03:55:30]  If they show you their stomach, like if they get down on the back and they start rolling  around, they're like, mama, mama, that's how you know you've got them.  You can get them there, yeah.  You should do the bro whisperer.  Figure out a way.  How long was it, how long did you have to perform before you figured out how to control  these bros like that?  I mean, I don't attract a lot of bros.  I mean, but...  But, I mean, you have to understand what's going to happen.  So, like, you have to, you know...  Especially on Times Square.  In Times Square, on St. Patrick's Day. 
[03:56:00]  I mean, I don't know what's going to happen.  I think we're going to have to have some tight security.  I think I might, you know, have to...  So, you know, it can be good as bringing them up on stage.  You just bring...  Sometimes I bring them up on stage and do, like, an intense interview, and usually they  just kind of show...  Speaking of bros...  Yeah, it's DJ Who Kid.  What's up, Who Kid?  What up, Who Kid?  This is Natasha, and this is Moshe.  So, he just comes in halfway...  He comes in whenever.  Yeah, I mean, he's on...  He's wearing a hat that says swagger advisory, and he, I have to say, walked in with a great  deal of swagger. 
[03:56:30]  There's a reason why they call it...  I'm a Negro.  There's a reason.  They call it, you know, black people time.  It's true.  But it's true what it is.  We were just...  Are you a Scientologist, Who Kid?  No, I'm a Negro.  What was that?  Oh, that's what I was saying.  Black people shouldn't be Scientologists.  Yeah, that's true.  But Will Smith is.  I mean, I'm a conspiracy theorist.  I don't know about...  All black people are conspiracy theorists.  That's true.  Illuminatists, whatever.  Here's one thing I know about black people now, because in Moshe, I know black people shouldn't  be Scientologists. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  They're all conspiracy theorists.  Of course.  And they're all terrified of magicians.  I didn't say that, but that is true.  It is true.  Yeah.  It is true.  Poor people don't like seeing coins and, like, disappearing.  Where did it go?  Give me that back right now.  Get that shit out from behind my ear.  Oh, that's a real good trick.  Now, where's my fucking quarter?  You better make another one of those appear, bitch.  I'm already mad we ain't got a nigga Pope, man.  I'm so mad.  Did that disappoint you?  We got a nigga president, but no nigga Pope, man.  Right.  I'm upset about it, too.  It's whack, man. 
[03:57:30]  That would have been cool, man.  Yeah.  It would have been good.  We were saying he would have been Pope dope.  Can you imagine, like, all those people fainting?  Yeah, totally.  They would have been like, ah.  In world news today, Catholicism has dropped its membership by 50%.  Natasha's looking at you puzzled.  I think she's wondering why you walked in and within 15 seconds, the N-word quotient in the room went up by 100,000%.  No, we're all niggas, but we're all naturally niggas.  We're niggas, too?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's actually what Patrice said.  I didn't know if I could drop an n-bomb on the air, but he didn't say Jewish, Jewish. 
[03:58:00]  He said, your name might as well be Jewish, Jewish, niggas.  And I was like, oh, my God, thank you, Patrice, for calling me, niggas.  I appreciate that.  That's what happened.  I'm going to be hyped right now.  My titties are shaking right now.  But who the kid comes on here all the time?  And believe it or not, most of the audience to this show is indeed white people.  Come on.  A lot of people have trouble.  Yeah, I know, Moshe.  A lot of people have trouble with that.  But what happens is that now this whole group of white listeners and fans come when WhoKid is DJing somewhere, 
[03:58:30]  and they all call it, niggas!  I love it.  You do like it?  I'm a racist, too.  But you only like it if it's niggas.  Yeah, but I became white, what, like seven years ago.  What was the transformation process like?  You started with a personality test.  Oh, yeah?  I had, too.  But when I had Donald Trump on my show, the racist situation just attacked me.  He attacked you?  Yeah, he's very racist.  Donald Trump is racist?  Yeah, he put it on me, this ointment of racism. 
[03:59:00]  What did he say to you?  He said, yo, you're a real nigga.  I was like, wow.  Donald Trump said that?  Yeah.  Wow.  You also have to know it.  He seems so cool.  That's so weird.  Betty White, too.  Betty White called you a nigga?  Come on.  What a lot of people don't know, like, everybody knows that Who Kid is Black.  A lot of people don't know he's a liar, too.  Like, he lies constantly.  Oh, you're just straight up a liar.  Yeah, he's constantly making up fibs for attention, you know?  He just says things sometimes.  Let me go to Brad in Hoboken.  Yeah, I just wanted to say that that show that Natasha's on, Burning Love, when she did stand-up on that, 
[03:59:30]  was probably the funniest thing I've seen in a long time, when she said her pussy was as tight as a toddler.  How can you say you're not somebody that bros would be into?  Every bro wants to hear a girl say, my pussy's as tight as a toddler.  Wow.  Thank you.  It is funny.  She's hilarious on Burning Love.  People should check it out.  Where can they check it out?  On E.  Or on Yahoo, right?  On Mondays on E.  Well, they took it off Yahoo, because now it's on the internet, or it's on E. 
[04:00:00]  TV's still better than the internet, right?  I don't know.  I think maybe not.  Not if you want to find somebody whose pussy is tighter than a toddler.  Right.  You can literally find a toddler's pussy on the internet.  That's not available on the television.  Whoa.  No, no.  To ease credit, though, I do.  Although, you should get that on TV, because you can find a lot of channels.  To ease credit?  To ease credit, I think that was on, they said that on E.  I was just about to ask that.  I didn't even think of that, but.  That's nuts.  Well, see, what happens now is they're like, on the internet, it's like a breeding ground, 
[04:00:30]  and they're creating these things, and then the networks see that these people have created  something funnier than what they could create with all their cooks and corporations, and  then they just buy it and put it on.  So instead of saying, we've got to figure out who's coming up with these great ideas and  hire them, they're like, oh, well, you have to buy that idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's kind of a cool new thing that's happening, and I think it's going to be happening more  and more.  That's good.  It's very good, because it wouldn't have happened that way if E would have, I mean, no offense,  but they would have tried to cast it and put it together. 
[04:01:00]  And especially based on that joke, I don't think it would have made it onto E before the  internet.  Yeah.  Well, she looks like she has a small vagina, though.  I'm curious.  Do you, or is that just the character?  You look like you have a small dick.  It looks like it's probably very large.  I imagine it's big.  I'm going to look at my pants.  You don't have to.  Is your vagina small, or is that just the character?  Here we go, Natasha.  I was just telling Moshe, like, whenever you do radio as a woman, it always comes to,  like, people want to know how you finger yourself. 
[04:01:30]  My lord.  People want to know how big it is.  How big that pussy, Natasha?  I wouldn't have asked the question if you hadn't have gone on television and said,  my pussy's as tight as a toddler.  But I'm playing a character.  That was a lie.  Although, when she did Fresh Air with Terry Gross, she also asked her how big her pussy was.  It's radio across the board.  God damn it, Terry Gross.  I'm always trying to get in the headlines.  Serious fallopian tubes right there.  That was good.  Andy in Pittsburgh. 
[04:02:00]  Hey, Moshe's exactly right.  When, uh, there's a saying in the street that you can't call it a con.  So when Will Smith goes there and gets conned into Scientology, uh, he just seems to lose  all street cred.  Except that you're saying that Will Smith is a con.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I think he's...  Do you just want to do quotes, sir?  I think he's saying that Moshe, like, black people shouldn't be able to get hustled.  Yeah, it's true.  And I think Will Smith seems so smart.  I mean, I guess they're probably all smart.  The truth is.  Will Smith seems so white. 
[04:02:30]  No.  I mean...  I mean, he's gay, too, so maybe that's what he is here.  I thought he was married with children.  Oh, come on.  Whatever.  Am I naive?  You don't hear her?  She knows who I'm talking about.  No, he seems pretty...  He seems pretty gay.  Yeah.  Will, if you're listening, will you call in and just let us know if you are a homosexual?  We are curious.  And also, if you want to do a little guest spot on one of our shows...  Sunday's open.  Sunday would be a good night.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Will Smith will be at Caroline's on Sunday.  Roland's gay, too.  Ain't no wrong with that. 
[04:03:00]  Roland, are you gay?  Do you guys know Roland?  No, I'm gay.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry, Roland.  I thought you were.  I'm sorry.  No, of course not.  It's okay, Roland.  Roland's got quite a presence.  You think so?  Quite an outfit.  It looks like he just got done watering lawns.  Well, Roland is, of course, you know, with that body, you'd expect somebody to wear workout  pants.  Do people know what he looks like?  Yes.  People know what he looks like.  I mean, not today.  Well, he's Mexican, you know.  He's wearing his Brooklyn Nets workout pants and his extremely large Han Solo t-shirt. 
[04:03:30]  It's Han Duo.  No, you're true.  Everybody loves Roland.  You know, you ever been in this?  You know, we were talking about these DJs going over the top.  And talking about vaginas and things like that.  To women.  To women.  Yeah.  Because I'm not sitting there being like, hey, by the way.  Moshe, how big is your dick?  Yeah, but Moshe said it to who, kid?  But that's exactly what we were saying.  No, but he said it after.  He asked me how tight my vagina was. 
[04:04:00]  But that's just what we were saying.  It's like, and a woman can't come back and be like, oh, really?  Well, how big is your dick?  Because the DJ will be like, oh, my dick is big.  It's real nice.  Like, they don't feel uncomfortable at all.  No, you want to see it, honey?  It's right out right now.  You want to hype me now?  Getting hyped right now.  But, you know, people, you're talking about getting lathered up, too, right?  You know what the situation is, who, kid?  You're all lathered up, right?  You're ready to shave.  I didn't bathe yet.  Oh, you mean all the shaving yet.  What do you mean lathered up?  You know, you get lathered up, prepared to shave.  Follow me. 
[04:04:30]  You like this, right?  Look at this shit.  Keep talking.  Keep talking.  Keep talking.  And you realize.  Yeah, Roland.  Yeah.  You forgot to buy blades.  Ooh, yeah.  Keep talking.  What are you doing, Stan?  Put a little depilatory on that, like a black dude?  No.  No.  Shave this shit.  You start digging through the garbage can.  Oof.  And you know, it's still sexy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, keep talking.  Yeah, we're listening.  Yeah, and you look for old blades, because you've got to shave that face.  Old blades.  You've got to shave that face, but it's going to zombie out your face, isn't it?  Oof.  Because it's an old blade.  It's all worn down. 
[04:05:00]  So what do you do?  Nah.  You realize that you just had your Dollar Shave Club moment, my friends.  Oof.  You just got there.  Dollar Shave Club.  What's all the buzz about?  Everybody's asking.  Moshe.  Natasha.  Who's the Dollar Shave Club about?  I'm so happy right now.  It's a commercial.  I'm really happy.  I always read things.  Here's what all the buzz is about.  Everybody buys razor blades all the time.  Moshe, you buy razor blades.  Sure I do.  I'm a man, aren't I?  But they're so expensive.  They are expensive. 
[04:05:30]  More than a dollar.  Is there a way to get a fever?  Well, the thing is, Natasha, you may not know this, but men don't actually need vibrating  handles on their razor blades.  They don't need, like, you know, the ten blades and the back scratchers and all this  nonsense.  They just need a good razor blade, right?  You gotta shave that little pussy.  You gotta shave that toddler pussy.  Right, and you have to shave toddler pussy.  Did your sponsor into this?  I don't know for sure.  Maybe we'll do a little editing before we send off the spot, but...  I forgot this was a commercial.  But it's not.  It's just natural dialogue. 
[04:06:00]  But what you can do now...  You're doing a great job.  Thank you.  What you can do now...  Do you know anything about stamps.com?  No.  No, I don't know anything about that website.  I'm talking about dollarshaveclub.com.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  What you can do is, you don't overpay for blades ever again.  With Dollar Shave Club, you send them a couple bucks a month, and then they deliver great  quality razor blades right to your door.  Do they accept checks?  No, but money orders, I'm sure, would be fine.  You know.  Okay.  Uh, you save a fortune, and you always have fresh blades on hand, because Moshe... 
[04:06:30]  That sounds great.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not like they're going to sit there and just give you what you need for the month.  They're going to give you a little extra, so you're going to be cool.  I think they should change their name to freshblades.com.  Freshblades.com.  No.  I like that idea.  Fresh blades.  Well, that's a good...  If nobody owns it yet, Dollar Shave Club, look into it.  You'll always have fresh blades on hand.
