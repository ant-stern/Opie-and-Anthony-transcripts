<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious tirade against staff members Sal and Eric for their chronic lateness.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton led the charge, detailing Sal's excuses involving train delays and construction, and Eric's traffic woes.  Travis voiced his frustration at arriving to an empty office, unable to get coffee due to their absence.  The discussion was punctuated with vulgar and offensive jokes at Sal and Eric's expense,  and involved several other staff members – Sam, Mar, and Kenny – adding their criticisms.  The hosts stressed the importance of punctuality, especially with a new boss, and the competitive nature of radio.  A briefly mentioned Yankees bobblehead giveaway mishap added to the overall chaotic morning.

The conversation then shifted to iPhone and Samsung phone frustrations, focusing on video recording, text deletion, and call initiation.  This segued into another critique of Sal's work ethic and ambition, expanding to a broader discussion on the work habits and personalities of other staff members, including Tim, Gary, and Steve.  Past production segments, both successful and disastrous ("Get The Panda Angry!"), were recounted to illustrate the importance of consistent effort and embracing creative failure.

The show then announced the day's guests: Rich Little, Michael Shannon, and Chris Weidman.  A clip of Rich Little’s Johnny Cash impression was played, followed by commentary.  The podcast *Opinion Athlete* (featuring Joe Rogan and Ari Shaffir) was promoted, along with a brief airing of a particularly bad, yet memorable, Wild Bill production skit ("You're in my fucking house").  Miley Cyrus's recent music video and appearance were discussed, before a substantial debate on the "mercy rule" in youth football arose, sparked by a news story about a $200 fine for coaches whose teams win by excessive margins.  Listener calls from a youth football coach, a drill sergeant, and others offered various perspectives on parenting, competition, and raising children in a competitive world.  The gender-specific toy aisles in Toys R Us and a listener's take on millennial work ethic were also briefly touched upon.

The next segment explored generational differences, contrasting the WWII generation's work ethic with the modern focus on mental health issues like PTSD and the impact of abusive parenting.  A Gen X caller, a millennial trainer, shared her experiences, highlighting the unique challenges faced by young people in the current economic climate.  This transitioned into a discussion about junior drag racing, sparked by a caller describing his 8-year-old daughter's participation.  The conversation included discussion on the objectification of women in the sport, and further diverged into the physical fitness standards of certain jobs (police, firemen), and frustrations with the perceived laziness and incompetence of some public servants, particularly within the bridge and tunnel authority.  Concerns about surveillance technology and privacy erosion through easy pass systems and license plate readers were also voiced.  Studio guest Rich Little then joined the show, discussing his career, impressions of Nixon and Reagan, and the evolution of show business.  The hosts also further promoted their upcoming guests (Chris Weidman and Michael Shannon).  The segment concluded with a humorous anecdote about a Cheerios commercial and further discussion on generational differences, specifically regarding cereal preferences.

Rich Little’s interview expanded on his career, including humorous anecdotes from celebrity roasts with George Burns, Jack Benny, Lucille Ball, Orson Welles, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and John Wayne, highlighting a particularly memorable unscripted moment with Jimmy Stewart.  He promoted his upcoming show, "Jimmy Stewart and Friends," and his Dean Martin Celebrity Roast Collection DVD.

Chris Weidman, the UFC fighter, followed, recounting his fight against Anderson Silva, focusing on Silva's taunting and Weidman’s knockout victory.  He discussed his Long Island upbringing, recent home purchase, the challenges of obtaining flood insurance after Hurricane Sandy, his walkout song ("Won't Back Down"), and his upcoming rematch with Silva.

Michael Shannon, the *Boardwalk Empire* actor, then discussed his character, approach to acting, the challenges of working on a show with secretive plot details, and roles in *The Iceman*, *Man of Steel*, and other projects, including his band Corporal's upcoming performance.

Jim Norton then hosted his advice segment, prefaced by a self-deprecating description of his career.  The segment featured numerous calls with topics including sexual practices and potential links to childhood trauma, role play and potential underlying trauma, managing fallout from a drunken date, dealing with a judgmental mother regarding drinking, a threatening voicemail from a Navy husband after an affair, seeking medical advice for sleep apnea, age gap anxieties in a relationship, managing anxiety, dealing with an STD from a fling, overcoming heroin addiction, sexual issues in a relationship, quitting smoking, and hair transplant considerations.  Norton’s responses were often laced with coarse language and sexually explicit discussion, interspersed with sponsored mentions of Mama Mancini's meatballs.

The show concluded with a commercial break featuring enthusiastic endorsements for Mama Mancini's Italian sauce and meatballs, highlighting "real ingredients,"  the availability of turkey meatballs, and a contrast with restaurants using "too much salt and shit ingredients."  Opie promoted his upcoming show with Andrew Dice Clay at the Beacon Theater and mentioned "Fez and Ron" as the new name for another show.

But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down.  Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then gets very uncomfortable. 
[00:04:00]  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  Yay.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die. 
[00:04:30]  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  My nipples are kind of hard.  Kind of hard.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Morning, everybody.  Up and running.  That's right.  Up and running.  What a.  Most of us up and running.  Most of us up and running.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:05:30]  Sam, you're just getting here, too, huh?  Oh, no.  It's a late day for everybody, I guess.  I saw Sam when I came in, working diligently in the office.  That's what I do.  It's my job.  Oh.  Wow.  And you live the furthest away, I think.  Yeah, I live in Westchester.  What is that?  Like, snob?  Westchester.  How far is that?  Snob.  Five minutes?  Ten minutes?  No, it's about a 30-minute drive without traffic.  Oh, really?  25, 30 minutes. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, we got members on the staff that just don't want to get here on time.  Oh, no.  It's crazy.  Not you.  What happened today?  What happened?  Let's get it out.  A 30-minute drive without traffic.  Oh, really?  25, 30 minutes.  Yeah, we got members on the staff that just don't want to get here on time.  Oh, no.  It's crazy.  Not you. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  What happened today?  What happened?  Let's get it out there on the table.  I left at 6.01.  No.  No, you're not the problem.  I guess Iraq and Sal decided to get here around 5.55 or so.  Oh, Jesus.  According to Travis, who was very pissed off.  Oh, no.  For both of them?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  How did that happen?  Were they hanging out together?  I don't know. 
[00:07:00]  Maybe they had a late night or something together.  Don't we have a new boss?  What are you doing?  You get away with that shit with the idiots that were running this joint, but not the new  guy.  He's going to pay attention.  He's not going to fucking put up with that shit.  You know what time we used to come in?  What?  4.30.  4.30.  Wow.  You know what?  I don't want to be the guy to say it, but I will say this much.  Yeah, that's when you should come in.  4.30.  We don't need anyone starting at 6 o'clock.  And then when we got the bosses here, the old regime, in a meeting once when we were 
[00:07:30]  having issues with certain staff members being late all the time, they said, we really  don't see any reason why you can't be here by 5.30.  And Travis and me looked at each other like, 5.30?  Are you fucking kidding?  This is fantastic.  I can't believe it.  Oh, my God.  We don't need anyone at that point.  Of course.  You need people here early.  I mean, some of you guys are on the air and you absolutely contribute to the on-air product.  But in general, by showtime, we don't need anybody. 
[00:08:00]  We don't need to see Sal walking around at that point.  No.  He's useless today.  And Eric's useless today.  Sorry, but you are.  Oh, boy.  Because anyone could push the fucking buttons going in a fucking break.  Apparently not.  Sometimes.  Not on time.  Jesus.  It is a thing, though, that once the show's up and running.  There's no...  It's running.  Right.  We don't need anyone.  We're well prepared.  We're here to push you guys, and you're the wheels that move down that hill.  It's moving now. 
[00:08:30]  Now we're moving.  It's already been pushed.  You don't need to show up at the top of the hill.  It's already rolling down.  Oh, no.  What did you get here now for?  It's already down the hill.  What happened, Travis?  Travis walked in really mad, and we asked, what's wrong?  I walk over to the printer to print out all the work that I've been doing for the last  hour.  Oh, shit.  For the last hour.  Well, yeah.  I think it's more than reasonable that the behind-the-scenes staff gets here at five.  Sam and I are here at five.  I'm not asking much.  Right.  Diligently working.  Sam told me...  So you and Jess, he told me he gets up at fucking...  What time do you wake up? 
[00:09:00]  3.55.  I couldn't get over it.  I get up at three.  Why would anyone wake up that early?  He gets up at three.  Oh, it's terrible.  Three, yeah.  To make sure he's here by five to fucking help us out.  Oh, my God.  Hour and a half.  Well, now I'm starting to think, who are the stupid ones here?  Well, I don't think E-Rock's stupid because, you know, he got away with it for many, many  years.  But my point is that the new guy is not going to put up with that.  I'm sorry.  That's the craziest part.  I can't imagine the thinking behind getting here at six o'clock in the morning when we 
[00:09:30]  just got a new boss.  Right.  You know?  Just got a new boss.  E-Rock comment?  Comment?  Oh, like...  Look who's coming in, though.  Brave, young, late Sal.  Plus, Sal knows he gets hammered for everything.  Like, there is nothing this show likes to do more than hammer on Sal.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I don't know.  Yeah, but we've been over this. 
[00:10:00]  Like, you know, you're working for your own fucking career, not ours.  Oh, boy.  Who the fuck's going to hire a guy that shows up at 5.55 for a morning show and starts at  6?  Well, I can be here five minutes before the show starts.  Like, you should be working hard for your own fucking career.  Holy shit.  Work hard for the money.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  So hard for it.  So what happened, Travis?  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  That's fine.  So I'm printing out all my work and Kenny says, is Eric here?  I said, I would assume so. 
[00:10:30]  It's 5.55.  5.55.  He said, I don't think Eric and Sal are here because nobody came to take my credit card  for the coffee.  Oh, shit.  And I said, well, that's impossible.  It's 5.55.  So I walked back into the booth where normally one of them is manning the board five minutes  before showtime.  I would assume at 6, buttons have to be pushed.  Yeah.  Sometimes before 6.  Oh.  You know what's great, too?  I can only imagine because when I get here, I try to find stuff for the show, right? 
[00:11:00]  Sure.  So I don't know exactly everything else that's going on around here the first hour before  the show.  And Travis is looking for news articles.  So he doesn't know everything else that's going around here the first hour before the  show because we're trying to be able to just pile shit in front of you guys that you might  use 30% of it, hopefully.  That would be great.  The interns must have just been sitting here with nobody.  Of course.  The interns are all here at 5.15, 5.30.  With nobody.  But Sal and Eric, who's in charge here, ain't you? 
[00:11:30]  So the interns are just sitting here like, what?  Like, we're getting school credit for this?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The interns are here.  And it's not a rare occurrence is what I'm getting at here.  Oh, no.  It happens way too much.  Like, Sal, you're useless.  Oh, Jesus.  Can I, I would like to...  You're absolutely useless today.  You might as well go home.  I don't give a fuck.  The show will be great today and it'll have nothing to do with you.  You want to filibuster?  No, I would like to do it.  Like, Cruz, get up there and filibuster.  I would like to just defend myself. 
[00:12:00]  I would not, could not in a box.  Sal, but there's nothing you can say.  There's nothing you can say.  You're not, you're working for your own career and you still don't understand that.  I know.  It has nothing to do with us.  Eventually, we'll be out of the business or moving on and you're still a young kid with nowhere to go because you're not, you don't work hard.  I want to just...  Oh, wait.  Also, by the way, I heard that E-Rock called to say he was going to be late, but he called Sal, who was also late.  So no one here knew. 
[00:12:30]  Because he's not stupid.  He calls the one guy that it doesn't matter you call when you're late.  But then you could say, hey, I called, but you didn't call like Travis.  Or us or text us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think he has my fucking number by now.  You didn't get a guess what?  Of course you called the weakest guy.  You know what time it is?  You near a clock?  You near a clock.  Sal, comment.  I instructed Travis earlier this month that for the entire month of September, there's train... 
[00:13:00]  Until further notice, I would be taking Mondays off.  This is not starting well.  I'm a man of leisure.  I'm not a man of leisure.  I instructed...  I instructed...  A banana, my Steve.  ...for the foreseeable future.  Yeah.  I told Travis that there's construction going on at the train that I take to come into work.  For the entire month of September, I'll be getting here between 5.30 and 6.  I usually get here at quarter after five.  What's the alternative to get here a little bit earlier? 
[00:13:30]  Thank you, Jimmy.  I would have to buy a cab or something like that.  Well, then you got to do what you got to do.  And I told you.  I said, that's fine.  Right.  I said, but if you are going to be later close to 6, let me know.  You said later after 6.  I got here before 6.  Sal.  Oh, my God.  You got here what?  I got here before 6.  By two minutes.  Still before 6.  So I paid for a cab.  This is why I can't talk to, like, younger people.  Oh.  They don't even have a concept of what they're doing to themselves. 
[00:14:00]  I knew I wasn't going to be here after 6, so I didn't tell Travis.  So as I was, I bought a cab to get up here today.  It's fine that I was late.  I knew I was going to be late.  You're a slacker.  I mean, good luck being a slacker.  You might be the first one that figures it out.  But I know a million people in this business.  No one would hire a guy like you.  You're a slacker, McFly.  I know a million people.  They would never accept a guy showing up at 5.58.  And then that person thinks it's okay to show up at 5.58.  It drives me nuts. 
[00:14:30]  I have Ajita coming here late every single day.  But on the way up here, Eric texted me saying, hey, dude, I'm going to be a little bit late.  Can you just run the board for me?  Can you just see that?  This is so cool.  Late, buddies.  Let's walk in together.  We'll pretend we were in an accident.  So what time did Eric text you?  Uh-oh.  And by the way, when you get a testimony.  When you get a text from Eric that says, I'm going to be a little bit late.  Because on time.  You know how most people, if you're on time, you're late.  If you're late, you're early for Eric. 
[00:15:00]  So when he says, I'm going to be a little late.  Like, you're lucky he's here for the first hour of the show.  Eric texted me today at 5.51 a.m.  That's when the text, at 5.51 it says, I'm going to be late.  Not like, I'm panicking because I'm already 51 minutes late.  I was going to say, Sal, you should have told me that Eric was going to be late.  But it's 5.51.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like.  As soon as it happened, I said, I'm not there yet.  You've got to ask Travis.  And he's not there yet.  I'm not there yet. 
[00:15:30]  That's what I said.  What else am I going to say?  I'm not there.  And Eric writes, okay.  Can you process this, Sam?  I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  I can't even wrap my head around this because he has no awareness that this is a problem.  I love it.  I know it's a problem.  For your own life.  Not even our lives.  Because I don't need you to do a radio show.  Period.  I understand that.  But I'm saying.  We gave you a pretty amazing break in this business.  And you're blowing it.  Because eventually, eventually you're going to have to move on however it happens.  And no one's going to fucking hire you.  Oh, jeez.  You're just going to be a low level who gives a fuck guy in this business. 
[00:16:00]  You have no.  I understand.  You have no comprehension.  I'm just saying I had a scenario.  Because it's your fucking generation.  I have to say it.  And I told you.  I said, if it's going to be closer to 6, let me know.  I said, I understand if you're going to be here.  You said after 6.  Sal, why would I say after 6?  You don't even have the text.  After 6 o'clock doesn't matter.  What does it mean it doesn't matter?  I knew I was going to get here before 6.  Sal, let me ask you.  I can't even voice my own opinion here.  Why would I tell you to let me know if it's going to be after 6 when after 6 the show is on?  I need to know before 6.  The show starts. 
[00:16:30]  We all know when the show starts.  So you told me at that specific time to let you know.  I covered for it.  And I covered for you when you're not here and I don't say anything about it either.  You're not supposed to say anything.  It's your fucking job.  I cover for you when you're not here.  You're not supposed to.  This isn't like, oh, I covered for Travis the last three days.  Let me come in late and it's totally fucking okay.  No, it doesn't.  But I'm just saying we all help each other out when we're trying to cover for the other person.  That's all I'm saying.  We all work together.  We try to work together.  But it turns into everyone fucking throwing the other person. 
[00:17:00]  And I let you know that I wasn't going to be here.  I let you know days ahead of time.  I didn't let you know five minutes ahead of time.  I'm just saying that in the event that something is going on, someone's not going to be here or whatever.  The other person, people step up around here and they help the other person out.  But it all turns into is this guy's not here.  Fuck him.  That's all it fucking turns into.  No, it doesn't.  If you texted me and you said I'm not going to be here until six today, I would have covered for you.  But you didn't.  So how the fuck am I supposed to cover for you?  I can't do my own job and call everyone on the staff to make sure that they're going to be here on time. 
[00:17:30]  Or I got to do their fucking job, too.  Okay.  Nobody else in the world calls their staff every morning and says, hey, you're going to be here on time or should I do your job today?  But how am I supposed to anticipate Eric going to be here late?  So I'm not here.  So all of a sudden, everyone else's responsibilities fall under me.  You're here.  I will now be accepting you are a genius.  I'm here doing my job.  You want to let me know you're going to be a little later than normal?  That's fine.  But it wasn't my job to launch.  I don't do that. 
[00:18:00]  Eric does that.  So it's coming down on me for some fucking reason.  You're the only other person here who could launch to let get the show.  It's coming down on you because you were late.  It doesn't matter what your job here is.  You're still late.  I understand that.  But you were instructed earlier.  I told you six weeks ago.  Stop telling me you instructed me to do something.  I told you six weeks ago that I was going to be here between 5.30 and 6 for the rest  of the month.  So the one day that Eric shows up late, this is my fucking fault?  This is fucking ridiculous, dude.  I'm not saying it's your fault that Eric is late.  You just said it's my fault. 
[00:18:30]  You're the only other person here who could cover it for if I'm not here or Eric is here.  Eric was late.  This is fucking ridiculous.  It's your fault you were late.  It's not your fault that Eric was late.  That's how it's going.  Dude, I told you earlier this month that I'm going to be here between 5.30 and 6 every day.  And I said, that's fine.  Let me know if it's going to be closer to 6 instead of 5.30.  Because normally you were here closer to 5.30 than 6.  But he's saying you said after 6.  I never would have said after 6.  I think we should see what Troy Kwan thinks about this.  No, no, no, no.  What?  It's all fine. 
[00:19:00]  Troy doesn't have an opinion.  He gets here nice and early.  We should ask him how he figures it out.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  But, Sal, we don't need you at 5.30.  We don't need you at 6 o'clock.  Like, what are you doing for the show today now that you showed up at 5.55?  I will be on phones between 6 o'clock.  We might take two to three phone calls a day.  Regardless of if you take calls or not, I need to be there to do it.  So if you're not there, oh, well, we won't take phone calls today.  Who cares?  The intern would do it.  The intern would do it, right?  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:19:30]  And why can't you come in earlier?  What's that?  It's a hassle that your trains are all fucked up.  But why can't you come in earlier for a month?  I cannot afford a $30 cab ride.  What time would you have to get up earlier to catch the earlier train?  There's construction between 11.59 p.m. the night before until 5 a.m.  Let me ask you.  Could you take a cab to a different train stop?  That way it wouldn't cost $30.  It would cost, like, $5 for the cab.  Right. 
[00:20:00]  And then you get on a different train.  Oh, damn you, Sam.  Damn you.  But, no, it's mainly getting from Brooklyn to New York.  Like, once I'm in New York, I could take a cab or take any other of the numerous trains  that run at that time.  Yeah, in theory, I could do that.  But it's just as expensive.  So your train, the train by your house is not running between 11.  It doesn't run between 11.59 p.m. the night before and 5 a.m. the next day.  And then from 5, it takes how long to get here?  It takes about, it takes, you know, on a normal day, if everything works out beautifully,  I get on the 4.45 train at my stop, and I get to work at quarter after 5. 
[00:20:30]  So it takes about roughly a half hour.  If everything works smoothly.  So then what happened this morning?  Everything didn't work so smoothly.  Everything didn't work so smoothly.  I'm waiting at my stop, waiting for the first train to happen after construction.  Oh, the train didn't show up?  Oh, okay.  The train showed up late.  It varies.  Like, sometimes, look, it's New York subways.  Oh, I know.  Sam's not saying anything that's not true.  I've sat at train stations for 20 minutes waiting for a train.  Oh, I know.  They're fucking crazy.  And then you miss that train, and then you're waiting for a long interval for the next transfer.  You know the guy you made fun of, Denny, you know? 
[00:21:00]  Uh-oh.  And he doesn't, I mean, I'll be honest, he doesn't really do much around here, but he at least shows up.  He at least shows up, and he's ready to go at any fucking moment.  At least they call his number.  I understand that.  They need him to come out of the fucking bullpen.  You know what?  He's just waiting for the coach to put him in.  He's just waiting.  He doesn't have to even be here, but he makes sure he gets here nice and early.  Put me in, coach.  I'm ready to play today.  Oh, Sal went through.  Put me in coach.  He went through a full internship.  He's paid his dues.  I know.  That's true.  That's what happens.  You know, I'm just saying, like, I don't, it's frustrating that since Eric came here, 
[00:21:30]  I'm not trying to throw Eric under the bus.  Eric gets here at his normal time.  Everything's understood.  He does his job.  What's his normal time?  It's like around, it's around between 6.50, sorry, 5.50 and 6.  Like any time around there.  That's his normal time.  But whatever.  It doesn't matter.  Eric gets here.  He does that job.  Eric, do you want to comment?  Or you can just sit there?  Eric, comment.  No, no, I'm not trying to throw up.  And I've talked to him about this a million fucking times.  Uh-oh, I think I see club soda.  Oh, I thought he was coming in. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, boy.  Okay, Eric, comment.  I'm not usually here between 5.50 and 6 o'clock.  That's what he says.  That's what Sal's saying.  Uh-oh.  What time are you normally here?  Usually around 5.40.  That's not that much better, but.  Closer to, a little closer to 5.45.  Squeak there.  Squeak down a little bit.  Maybe it's, it's 5.48 to 5.50.  We should never beat half the step into, into the show. 
[00:22:30]  What time do you get here, Opie?  5.30.  Sit there and I read four fucking papers and then I go.  Oh, my God.  5.30.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you ever look around like, oh, I have an idea for today's show, but there's no one  to tell.  There's literally no one.  There's nobody around to tell.  No.  There's nobody.  There are actually at least three interesting stories on 1010 Winds on the way in, but talk 
[00:23:00]  about the inability to multitask.  That's me.  I mean, there's no secret there and trying to drive like a maniac like I do, like I think  and go, okay, I'll remember that.  And then I don't.  If somebody was in earlier, like during the time I'm driving in and actually listening  to Winds, maybe in the background while they do something else and, and just hear those  little tidbits.  I won't say nugget tidbit stories, you know, things like that.  Maybe that we could do something on.  Oh, my God.  The Yankees fucked up their Mariana Rivera bobblehead doll fucking giveaway yesterday. 
[00:23:30]  They weren't fucking, uh, they didn't get there on them.  The trucks didn't get there.  There's a stadium full of fucking people.  Eric and Sal driving the trucks?  Oh!  Yeah.  Stadium full of people waiting for their free Mariana Rivera bobbleheads.  Oh, it was like a riot.  Then they had a lineup for fucking like the complete side of a stadium up the ramp, back  downstairs, across with vouchers in their hands from the third inning, the missing the 
[00:24:00]  game.  It was a disaster.  But I, and John Montone's talking about it.  It's like, and I think they rehired George Costanza.  Yeah.  It was funny.  But how bad do you need a bobblehead?  People want these Mariana Rivera bobbleheads.  Fuck the bobblehead.  They want, and tonight, Charlie Brown bobblehead dolls.  So we'll see if they redeem themselves.  Not going to get me today.  No, I swear.  It's a Charlie Brown bobblehead tonight.  Yeah, bullshit.  This Rivera thing didn't happen. 
[00:24:30]  I know.  I'm the boy that cried Costanza.  Mar, do you want to jump in on this one or what?  I'm always here real early.  When you're here.  What time you wake up?  This guy takes more time off.  What?  Two.  He wakes up two.  Two.  Yeah.  Two.  Every two.  And the reason I do that is because if I miss that bus, then I have an hour to wait for  the next bus, and I'm still here on time.  Oh, man.  Sammy, you know, if you guys can't get here early, then fucking, I don't want you fired, 
[00:25:00]  but we'll fucking move you somewhere else.  I don't want, I don't, we don't need you.  October 1st, I'm going to go back to my, which is 5.30 or 5.40.  No, I get here a quarter after five.  I can't give you tomorrow.  I can't give you the rest of the week.  I'm not going to take that idea that Sam had about taking a cab to another station.  I do.  I simply cannot, I honestly cannot afford that.  I'm going to tell you one thing.  I don't know if I can expense this.  Next Tuesday, I will be here on time.  We'll get you a boring job in one of these dumb, tiny little fucking studios as a board 
[00:25:30]  op.  Where they come in at like 9, 9 to 5.  Yeah, you'll have a nice life.  Working 9 to 5.  What a way to make a living.  There's literally three work days left in the month.  And he goes, I simply cannot afford three cab rides.  Oh, shit.  I paid for one today.  I simply can't do it.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to do it.  I know, I've told you, expense it.  You can expense a ride to work.  Do you understand the work ethic?  I'll say it again.  It's horrible.  And it's not because you're letting us down because in the end, we don't need you. 
[00:26:00]  And that's the truth.  Ouch.  But you're working for your own career, your own future.  Why wouldn't you want to do that?  Look, this guy Mike is suggesting maybe Sal could take the trophy.  Participation.  World's greatest secretary.  Like, look at the work ethic in this room.  Fucking Jimmy goes out to Leno to be on national TV.  And he makes sure he's here the next day.  He doesn't have to do that.  If he told the company, look, I have to take a day because I'm doing Leno, they would 
[00:26:30]  never question it.  But he does it.  He gets on a fucking red eye just to make sure he's here the next day.  After doing Leno, that's crazy.  That's a fact, Sal.  Well, Jimmy's been shaking his head this whole time, too, because it's mind-boggling.  Yes, Parkinson's.  I have to blow up some of the later.  I'm just getting ready.  Jimmy, it's mind-boggling, right?  Yeah.  Because you're a young guy.  You're not established in anything yet.  You get a few perks here and there when you get established, but you're still trying to 
[00:27:00]  work towards something.  Why wouldn't you want to be here really early and really fucking put in an effort?  When I get here early, I can take care of my whole routine.  I don't have to stress.  Even 5.15, believe it or not, is not that early.  Five is like, I would think five for people that are setting up for a six o'clock show  or, you know, technically when the buttons need to be pushed, you know, when the replays  end and everything.  I would think five, an hour, one hour. 
[00:27:30]  It's a good rule of thumb for prepping for a show.  I don't think that's asking for much.  No, that's like the minimum.  Some do it in five to ten minutes.  I mean, if they could get it done in five to ten minutes, why take an hour to do what  you could do in seven minutes?  I didn't realize we had brilliant people around us that could do a job in five minutes.  Time management.  You over Sleepy Rock? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, E-Rock, what happened?  We heard about the subway and stuff like that.  Was I up late playing with some action figures?  No.  Writing fan fiction?  No.  Your movie?  Animating X DVDs?  No, it's a...  DVDs?  Coke float before bed, too much sugar, couldn't sleep.  Just one more.  It's a regular thing with him.  E-Rock, you're coming.  Then he gets, you know, then we talk about it, then he makes an effort for a while, and  then he fades back to, you know, when he wants to come in. 
[00:28:30]  At least fake it for a couple months.  He does.  I'm not stupid.  I'm very observant, trust me.  He does.  He fakes it for a little while, and then he goes back to slowly but surely getting here  at 5.30, 5.40.  You think someone's going to be in nice and early tomorrow?  Of course.  For a little while.  Give it time until the new boss isn't really paying that close attention anymore.  Oh my god.  And then you start sliding back.  You don't do it like...  Are you guys just thinking about the new boss getting wind of this and having a little  meeting with you guys?  He will not be happy.  Oh my god. 
[00:29:00]  Come on in, guys.  Take a seat.  It won't be fun, Tim.  It'll just be that.  Take a seat, guys.  I was listening to the show this morning.  What happened?  What?  We're not going to put up with that bullshit around here anymore.  We're not going to put up with it.  He'll fucking just verbally...  Yeah.  A verbal thrashing.  Which is not good, because E-Rock's been all gold stars with Tim so far.  Uh-huh.  Remember we were talking about that just the other day?  Yes.  How E-Rock was taking the reins at the meeting and...  Okay. 
[00:29:30]  That's why I'm befuddled by the whole thing.  Taking himself by the horns and really contributing.  So what happened?  We didn't get to your side of the story.  I understand.  E-Rock.  Come on.  I got stuck in traffic when I came out of the tunnel, and by the time I got here, I  didn't...  I saw how late it was, and I texted Sal and said, hey, could you, you know, set up the  board for six, because...  What was wrong with the tunnel?  As soon as I got through the tunnel, it was traffic down 42nd, because 8th Avenue was all  backed up. 
[00:30:00]  Boy, do you take 42nd Street?  That's where you come out of the tunnel, right to 42nd Street.  No, I know, but I mean, you actually make your right on 42nd Street?  Yeah, because it's usually dead at that time of the morning, and it was just...  It was stuck in...  With cars and buses and everything.  So wait, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  What time did you pull out of the tunnel?  It was like 5.30.  So what time did you text?  I texted when I got to the garage downstairs.  Why wouldn't you text at 5.30?  There was no text pull-off.  5.30, you see a bunch of traffic, you're like, uh-oh. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  Uh-oh.  You couldn't find a texting rest area.  Ah, yeah, right, the little blue squares now.  I told you you texted in the garage.  I haven't put them up yet.  What time did you leave the house?  What time did you leave the house?  Iraq?  I left at 5.  5.  Left at 5.  I was sitting in my work chair.  I was sitting in my work chair.  It's just so crazy because, like, to me, when...  Because we've been through regime changes before, and to me, new boss time is fresh start time. 
[00:31:00]  Fresh slate right there.  Like when we...  Because he's looking at everything.  You wipe it clean.  When we have no more Radio Wizard, no more fucking Steve Blatter.  You just, all of a sudden, oh, it's a fresh start.  When we got Stump Brain, I could be like, oh, this guy doesn't look at me like I'm just an intern like the old boss.  And then we got the next guy.  Oh, this guy will look at me like this.  And now the new guy, I'll be like, oh, I'll just be a rock star in front of him.  And that's how he'll look at me. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, you're on air fucking Sam Roberts.  It's a reset.  It's a reset.  Reset.  Oh, you get to do a new first impression.  And it's the same first impression.  And he keeps doing the same first impression.  Like, so maybe Mornings isn't for these guys.  We'll get them on other gigs.  You think?  Yeah, I like them.  I like the guys, but...  Throw them on music somewhere?  They make it obvious they don't like these hours.  So we'll get them better hours.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:32:00]  Because if you're not here early, then you really don't have to be here until 10 o'clock  to start, you know, doing what you do for the next show.  I hope he was saying yesterday, we need those nuggets, those things that just spark conversation.  The pop culture items, things that a lot of people are relating to.  You know, and on paper it might look silly, but, you know, with our brilliance and genius,  we turned it into amazing entertainment.  True.  Effortlessly.  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  And, you know, those are the things that you have to...  The only way to get them is to be there early, listening and pawing through things to see  and find those things.  You can't really find them with 10 minutes to go.  I watch four TVs just...  Just for a noogie.  And we always pick up some little dumb thing that they're already doing on TV that we might have missed.  Right.  And then we pick up the shit, you know, listening to 1010 Winds in the morning, like you just said.  Right, that's a big thing.  I listen to Winds all the way in, and 88, you know, all the way in. 
[00:33:00]  Newspapers in general are a waste of time, but every once in a while you've got something,  they're like, oh, fuck, I didn't know about this.  And you throw that at the guys and say, hey, remind me of this.  But then the staff can't say, well, they got MSNBC and 1010 Winds.  They're all set.  So I'll just show up when the show starts and be there to hit them buttons.  Hit them buttons.  Let's get t-shirts made.  Hit them buttons.  Hit them buttons.  With a little digital clock at the bottom that says 557. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Hit them buttons.  Hit them buttons.  You know, you should want to do it for yourself.  Oh.  Do we have the prep sheets for the...  Because first of all, this business is dying.  Your business, it's dying.  So why make it easy for someone to just, you know, pass you by?  Are you looking for it, Jim?  Prep sheets for the guests.  That would be sale.  Do we?  I have them.  I printed them out.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  That is true.  I mean, most people, like, with jobs like this are thinking, holy shit, how replaceable am I? 
[00:34:00]  Right.  Like, I got to make sure I'm always there.  You have to be a commodity.  Yeah.  Oh, this one.  Yes.  Something special.  Like, everyone's getting fired.  This business is truly dying.  There's not many shows anymore.  And the only way to get ahead is to be in the right place at the right time.  So you have to put yourself in as many places at as many times as humanly possible.  It's a very competitive business.  More and more models of radio are popping up in Pandora, Rhapsody, podcasts, online streaming. 
[00:34:30]  Just there's so many options besides regular radio and even satellite radio that if you're not a standout, take a hike.  It sounds corny, but you've got to make your mark.  You've got to do something that makes yourself irreplaceable or invaluable.  Yes.  Like, you don't want to just blend in and fucking pick up a check because they slash people, man.  Eventually, they'll get to you.  And they haven't replaced any of the jobs they've done here.  Look at that.  It's not like they're cutting jobs and going, we can't wait to re-spend that money. 
[00:35:00]  No, they don't fucking replace them.  We've had guys that have fallen to the wayside.  We've lost half our staff.  They don't replace them.  And they haven't replaced anyone.  We're waiting to find out when we're getting Thans replacements.  Yeah, exactly.  That was years ago.  All of our fucking replacements are over at Rockstar.  Yeah.  They're working there.  Yet every time that does happen, somebody comes into our office and tells me and say,  Well, we're going to start looking for something.  Yeah.  As soon as we fix the console in the studio.  Hope, please.  More responsibilities for me. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my God.  You think E-Rock and Sal are going to be commiserating later?  Fucking assholes.  Yeah, exactly.  That's all it is.  And that's the only thing that's going to come out of this.  Those guys are fucking assholes.  Fucking assholes.  Fuck them.  Well, you know, that's it.  And then they'll say something about you.  Of course they will.  And then, oh, and Travis did.  And then they'll say something about Travis.  Yeah.  It's not about us.  God, I can't stress that enough.  It has nothing to do with us.  You should do it for yourself.  Oh, man.  That's it.  Fuck. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, Sal.  It's not going to be like, here's like figuring out, yes,  there is indeed a problem.  This is what I, as an individual, can do to solve the problem.  And then this will never happen again.  And I won't have to put up with Sam.  And I won't have to put up with Travis.  I won't have to put up with Opie and Anthony and Jim.  Sounds magical.  And this is the solution to the problem.  It'll be, these guys are being fucking assholes again.  What can you do?  Oh, my God.  God, I don't want to raise a slacker.  Fuck. 
[00:36:30]  It scares the shit out of me.  Oh, boy.  Because I see it all around me, man.  Put them to work.  People with kids out there, just push your kid and say, look, you know, the kids you  go to school with, they're all assholes.  They're all slackers.  Just listen.  So if you just fucking focus on something, you're going to be way ahead of everybody.  Listen to all the breaks I do about my dad and just follow those rules.  I saw the change.  I don't know how many years ago it happened, but these kids come in and they just, like,  expect everything to be handed to them immediately. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, my goodness.  You got to give them nothing.  Dude, we got to earn everything.  No one gave us a real break.  No.  Like Mommy Dearest.  You don't get anything, Tina.  Nothing.  And then when she died, nothing.  Nothing.  Simply in the position, why would anyone give Sam the ammunition?  Like, why would you guys want to give Sam ammunition?  And, like, Sam's an example.  It's like the Syrian rebels.  You don't want to fucking arm them.  But he's a guy that does do a lot of shit. 
[00:37:30]  And it's like, you know.  Oh, shit is right.  It's a lot of it.  It's all utter, might I say, garbage.  But I'm saying, it's one thing after another.  Like, okay, I'll do that.  Okay, that's what you got to fucking do.  It makes you very, very hard to replace because you're always.  Go get her.  When you realize the quality is not there, you have to rely on quantity.  Quantity.  Of course.  That's it.  Your shitty voice.  It doesn't matter.  If you talk enough on enough stations, it doesn't matter.  Denny's a guy with a shitty voice.  And look at Denny's struggling through.  And a shitty mind to go with it.  Everybody had a tiny little head like a neatly quack Doberman Pinscher, Denny looks. 
[00:38:00]  Just sitting there gently barking at everyone that walks by.  How's your day?  Hot mic.  Yeah.  Wow.  So tomorrow.  What time can we expect you tomorrow?  Sale.  I'll take a cab into the city.  Oh.  Well, now I feel bad because you're going to be spending extra money.  But you can expense it.  Like you said, how about the other subway? 
[00:38:30]  The Canes take it to another city?  Well, I'll take the cab from Brooklyn into Manhattan.  I'll take the subway.  You know what that money is?  An investment in yourself.  Oh, wow.  In your future.  Did you text Eric?  You texted Eric back saying I wasn't here?  Yeah.  Why didn't Eric text somebody else?  Like Citadel stock, an investment.  Because if Eric texted somebody else, then they would know that it was minutes before the show started and he wasn't there.  He was hoping that everything would just fix itself and this first break would never happen. 
[00:39:00]  That's what he was hoping.  Sal was here.  And he would text Sal and say, I'm going to be late, which means I'm late already.  Ridiculously late already.  Sal is already here and goes, oh, it's okay, cool.  I got the board and stuff like that.  Don't worry.  And then he comes in.  Eric comes in and everything's fine.  And no one noticed and it's good.  But he didn't expect the monkey wrench of Sale also being late.  And that fucked his whole game up.  I told Travis and Eric this entire month this was happening. 
[00:39:30]  I know you did that.  Yeah, we know about that one.  I'm not talking about you.  I'm saying that you replied to Eric saying, I'm not here either.  And Eric said, all right.  Eric, were you practicing a tad of deception?  I have no more texts left.  Comment?  A little?  No.  When Sal wrote me back, I was already on my way up the building.  But when you initially made the text to Sal, were you already practicing a tad bit of deception on coming in a little late and trying to dodge that bullet? 
[00:40:00]  No.  It was more of, I got to make sure that the board was ready at 6 a.m.  So I texted at 5.52.  I've been late before.  Sal had my backup, so I thought he was already up here.  And I said, hey, could you take care of the board?  And he tells me, oh, I'm not here.  And I was already in the elevator coming up.  I've been late because of traffic.  You get stuck at, like, right before the George Washington Bridge.  I texted while I was in traffic.  Yeah, yeah, you gotta do that. 
[00:40:30]  Not after you get out of traffic.  That's what I don't understand.  It's like, and then I found a new way to drive to work.  I've done that before, too.  If somebody fucks up on the expressway and there's a lot of traffic, I will text Kenny, Travis, and just be like, oh, fuck, the expressway's fucked.  I send a picture so they know I'm not lying.  I'm like, look, taillights, fucker.  I send a picture.  Yeah, you don't need to do all that.  You're one of the hosts.  You're Anthony of Opie and Anthony.  You can just say you're, no one's thinking that you're making it up.  I'm late.  I've texted Sam before at four in the morning. 
[00:41:00]  Before, I'm even like, he might not be awake yet to let him know that I already know I'm going to be late.  Oh, man.  Because the subway's not working out.  That's what the hard part is, that when you came out into the traffic, why wouldn't you just fire off a text?  You're like, it's fucking 535 here.  There's something going on.  And send the text to Sal, Travis, Sam.  And then even if you're not late, like, if you send somebody a text and say, I may be late.  Or say, I'll probably be late.  And then you show up and you're not that late, you look like a million bucks.  Yes.  Because you're overprepared.  And I'm saying that E-Rock did not send that text to inform anybody that he was going to be late. 
[00:41:30]  Because he knows it's a problem.  And he sent that text to cover himself with Sal saying, hey, cover me.  I'm not going to be there.  If you wanted to let people know you were going to be late with that text, you would have texted Travis.  But you send it at 551 to Sal thinking, number one, Sal's not going to tell anybody.  Number two, it's so late.  Everybody's in a panic.  Oh, yeah.  Opie and Anthony are already talking about what they're going to talk about on the show. 
[00:42:00]  So this will just kind of slip right in there.  Oh, yeah.  Nobody will ever know what happened.  He doesn't text anyone else because he knows this is an ongoing issue.  Right.  Like, if he knows if he texted me.  Like, when you guys are late, when either Sam or Travis is late, we notice because it's like, wow, that's weird.  Right.  Because it's a strange occurrence.  Right.  I hope everything's okay is what you think.  Right.  Yeah.  And it's completely acceptable because none of us are perfect.  Right.  Well, I expect E-Rock to be late every day.  But E-Rock also knows if he texted me or Travis that our first stop would be, hey, Opie, Anthony, E-Rock's going to be late. 
[00:42:30]  And then our second stop would be, hey, Sal, could you cover this?  Yeah, you might want to say, Travis or even Sam, you know, you might want to text at 530.  Hey, look, just popped out of the tunnel.  Or even in the tunnel.  You can send a text to the tunnel.  If that's where the traffic is, sure.  Yeah, I mean, texts go through now.  They used to now.  But now if you're in the tunnel.  He gave us a good hour of radio, so I guess you are doing your jobs well.  Technically, they did their jobs well today.  Gave us an hour. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Whatever.  An hour ago, he wasn't even here yet.  No.  No.  He was in bed.  In bed.  Sam, are you saying you think there was some oversleeping going on?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm very suspicious of the traffic situation.  Very suspicious.  You don't buy it?  I don't, I don't, I don't buy it.  I bet that, I believe that there was about 90 seconds of traffic.  And that was like, yes.  Oh, what's he showing? 
[00:43:30]  Hold on.  What's he showing you?  Oh, it's a cockpit.  Okay.  He's got a photo of the traffic that he can show us at 6.52.  What time did you take the picture, Rock?  Is there a timestamp on it?  If there is, I don't know.  Just keeps it handy.  Yeah, it was probably Saturday night.  There's a fucking, no.  He doesn't know how to find it.  Yeah, hold on.  No, the phone doesn't usually timestamp, but there's no timestamp.  Because he didn't send it to anyone.  He just took the photo.  Oh, this is right, yeah.  Wait, is that the last photo you took?  Yeah.  Okay, so why wouldn't you have sent, instead of taking, instead of taking pictures, why 
[00:44:00]  wouldn't you have sent the text to the proper period?  This is the time I was late to work.  Look closely, the fucking Trade Center towers are in that picture.  Yeah, why wouldn't you, instead of doing the photo thing, why wouldn't you just send  the text to Travis?  Take a photo, 20 minutes later, send a text.  Yeah, what?  Yeah, I don't understand.  Why wouldn't you take a photo, like, you know you're late, so you're like, okay, so  this is what, you take a photo, because you need proof, right?  So at that point, you know you're going to be late. 
[00:44:30]  As quick as you could send that text, that's the better.  But then you win.  Until after you're out of all the traffic, the photo is a memory at this point, and you're  in the garage going, oh, maybe I could text someone.  Why?  That was the fail safe.  Just in case, because like, you do the minimal text out, just in case there was a problem,  you hold up the thing.  See?  Oh, all right.  How come you took the photo so long before you sent the text?  Once I got off 42nd, and I saw this was really, really bad, I took the photo. 
[00:45:00]  I didn't text anybody else.  I should have.  Wait, you got, I'm sorry, off 42nd from where?  You got off 42nd from where?  Off 42nd going on to 8th, and it was really bad, so I had to turn back off 8th and go around  all the way around through 6th to come around to the building.  You took the photo because you're like, I'm going to be late and I need proof, correct?  Well, any time something has happened, no matter what it was, I've always taken a photo.  So at that point, you know you're going to be late.  Yeah.  So you didn't think to send somebody a text instead of, ah, I could have a photo of this 
[00:45:30]  moment.  Yeah, I should have, but I did not.  What were you thinking?  That's a fair question.  At that point, after I took the photo, I was trying to get out of the way with all the  fire trucks.  Well, something for the scrapbook.  And I turned off.  So you were going to, but there was impending danger.  No, I was trying to learn how to get out of Spider-Man's way.  How long does it take to avoid fire trucks?  Exactly.  I understand that there was obviously something very, very dangerous happening. 
[00:46:00]  You couldn't be lollygagging texting.  Yes, I turned off and it was clear so I could head to 6th Avenue.  I just floored it all the way down.  Fair enough.  We're glad you're okay.  Obviously, you had a close call.  Yeah.  We're just lucky to have you.  Yep.  At any time, really.  Really, when you think about it.  It's a blessing.  You don't want to do the, it's like, you don't even want to, you don't, I know it's  that you don't want to do the bare minimum just to squeak by. 
[00:46:30]  It's like, you want to do something that makes you fucking stand out.  It is competitive, man.  And even if you don't have any goals beyond the Opie and Anthony show, like, it's...  It's an easy gig.  And you could argue that it's the biggest show on the platform.  It's certainly the biggest show that's on five days a week on the platform.  By far.  Oh, wow.  What about four days a week?  Yeah, definitely.  It's the biggest show four days a week, too.  What about three days a week?  Is AGT on the air?  No.  That's arguable. 
[00:47:00]  But like, over the summer?  Definitely.  Definitely over the summer.  In August, we're kings.  See, Sam's still keeping his options open.  You see what he's doing there?  He's smart.  Still keeping options open.  Yeah.  Hey, look, you guys are the crown princes of all media.  But what I'm saying is, like, there are people in this building.  Yeah.  They're like, fuck, if I could just, like, I would love to work for O&A.  It's embarrassing how easy this gig is.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, to begin with. 
[00:47:30]  The hardest part is getting shit on when you fuck up.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  The hardest part really is getting up early.  It's getting up.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the hardest fucking thing is getting up early.  Apparently so.  I've always said that.  Yep.  It's the hardest part.  It's a fucking breeze by the time you get in here.  Apparently so.  We're done by 10.  I mean, I know you guys have a longer day than we do.  No, I know you do.  Yeah, but once 10 o'clock is over or 11 o'clock is.  You're just cruising.  Yeah, you don't have to worry about not fucking up.  Like, you just have to not fuck up in the morning.  I was in a restaurant, like, Del Frisco's one day having lunch. 
[00:48:00]  And I'm looking at all these guys.  Yeah, just a gentleman.  But I was looking at all these people in their suits.  And I'm like, what a fucking life that must be to have to do that.  Not that it's torture.  But, like, just have to sit there and have those dog shit office conversations with your uncomfortable clothing.  Like, fuck, man, what an awful...  You realize you're lucky.  Oh, fuck.  In the end.  You're not snapping pictures with James Caan.  Yeah, exactly.  And I love getting pictures, too.  And I know that there are certain shows that don't let anybody get pictures. 
[00:48:30]  It's like, it was fairly lax here.  We're very generous.  Like, it's ridiculously lax here.  We're very generous.  Oh, because we had lame asses, you know, overseeing the damn thing.  But it's different now.  I don't even mean lax in a bad way.  I mean, like, as far as freedoms are concerned.  Like, the show gives a lot of freedoms to all of us to do kind of, you know, it's not as strict as it could be nearly.  There are a lot of jobs in this building alone that are significantly more difficult than this job.  Oh, yeah.  And much more, like, regular jobs. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  A lot of shows to work for that are more difficult.  Oh, man.  And you don't get any exposure from them because nobody's listening.  I see people running around.  Yeah.  I need sports stats.  Oh, okay.  They're saying there's a time stamp on the phone pick.  Press down on the pick, options.  Options will come up and hit on detail.  Yeah, I thought so.  Yeah.  And I'll bet Iraq's fairly...  Let me see if that works now.  Or if this guy's full of shite. 
[00:49:30]  No, that definitely works, yeah.  I believe that Eric...  Just hit on details of a picture and the options.  I believe that Eric is telling the truth about taking the photo in traffic.  Yes.  But it just makes things...  You see the time stamp?  It will back your story up.  It comes from the guy that had a branch in the way one day.  Let's not forget.  But then he took a photo of the branch.  I know.  That is true.  Which did not help his cause.  But that's what he does.  Like, he'll show his evidence, and then the evidence is true, but it's only more damaging.  Of course.  Like, this becomes more damaging, because now he knew enough to take a photo, but didn't 
[00:50:00]  think to text anybody to say, I'm going to be late.  I can't get any details.  What do you mean?  It doesn't come up on my phone.  Not on an iPhone.  Yeah.  It comes up on yours, right?  Mars.  Yes, sir.  What do you have?  The Galaxy S4.  See, it's all about the galaxy.  I'm telling you.  We got some tricks with these phones.  Maybe in the iPhone 6, they'll have time stamping as a feature, but they'll come up  with some crazy name for it.  My phone does a great trick.  The fucking video option disappears from the fucking... 
[00:50:30]  When I go to take a video, sometimes they say, aha, the great tantrum.  When I go to turn it, it just...  There's no option.  Look, details.  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  And I took a picture of the bowl of Lucky Charms that I had to eat.  Oh.  Did you eat one yesterday?  At 12, 12 p.m., see?  Oh, man.  It pops up on the Samsung, it gives you...  Yeah.  I was weak yesterday.  12, 12 p.m.?  That's not as bad.  It's not like you did at 12 in the morning.  No, but I came home and I just... 
[00:51:00]  At least we have text message timestamps now.  Yes.  That's great.  Well, what we don't have in the iPhone now is when you want to delete...  I send texts to myself with material ideas all the time and notes, and I go through  and I edit and I delete them so it stays current because I always send myself...  And now you can't do that.  Why?  I don't know.  It's so dumb.  And it's harder to make a call from a text.  It used to be the call button was in your text, so I would be texting you and I want  to call you.  Now you have to hit contacts, call, and then voice call. 
[00:51:30]  It's a three-step fucking process.  Yes, I don't like that.  Why are they adding steps?  Exactly.  I noticed that, too.  It's like, what the fuck is this?  I got to keep going.  By the way, can I just make sure everyone knows that Sal has decided we were done with him?  Uh-huh.  A segment over?  He's like, skulked out of here.  He just left.  That's right.  He just decided to leave.  That's the type of person we're dealing with.  That's right.  He didn't hear a word we said.  No.  It's too bad.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He's coming back. 
[00:52:00]  He's coming back.  All right.  Good, good, good.  I still support your Coke float theory, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just stepping out for, like, I don't know.  I thought you guys didn't want to talk to anyone.  Oh, jeez.  Just stepping out.  I thought it was break time.  I was taking phone calls right now.  Yeah, really.  I thought it was breakfast.  Who's on the phones right now?  And I remember one of Sal's selling points.  I'm sorry.  I remember one of Sal's selling points when you were first as intern here.  Blowjobs?  Yes.  Really.  He had G slash R, which meant give and receive.  And I'm like, how do you pass out? 
[00:52:30]  But, no, you were giving the other interns crap because they were not good workers.  I forget who the interns were at the time.  We always forget, yeah.  But you were all over them for being, and I'm not saying you're an awful worker or a bad worker,  but you want to do something.  You don't just want to be fucking one unnameable or unmemorable guy on the staff because when  jobs get cut, you want to be the one to think, oh, fuck, we got a movie.  You know.  Because you want to be on air, don't you?  Or do you want to be a producer? 
[00:53:00]  I don't want to be on air.  Or a producer's position?  I mean, yeah.  But you don't just want to be where you are.  You want to, you want to see the forward motion.  Yeah, advance.  Well, that ain't happening.  You don't think so?  Oh, man.  Not, not, no, no, no.  It's a lateral Sal.  What exactly is it you do here?  Yeah, you don't want to be in that position with a guy like Tim.  I mean, not that Tim is a fucking tyrant.  But he's actually paying attention.  And he's been around for a long time.  He's been around for a long time.  He'll pay attention.  And Tim, Tim, Tim Barrel talks. 
[00:53:30]  He's, every time I talk to Tim, the first thing I say, excuse me for interrupting, I just  fire you.  Yeah, yeah, he will just roll over you, man.  He will just roll, yep.  Yeah.  And you don't want that to be in a negative.  Oh, my God.  I can only imagine how fucking shitty that is.  He's fired people before.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's just part of his job.  He knows how to fire people.  Gary and Bladder were kind of thrust onto this show.  Yeah, I don't think Gary ever wanted it.  No, it's not.  He's more of a music guy. 
[00:54:00]  You know, whatever.  To be fair, I don't think he really ever wanted it.  I mean, we beat him up pretty good, obviously.  But Tim.  In the end, he's very happy he's not part of this anymore.  Tim's a guy who's.  And we've had nice conversations since, by the way.  Yeah, it's easier.  There's no more pressure.  No.  We were talking about Metallica the other day.  Just like, wasn't that great?  Yeah, it was wonderful.  But Sabian's a guy who wanted this.  And he's a guy who does this.  This is what he does.  And it's like, I'm not overselling Tim.  I'm telling you.  He ain't going to put up with shit.  Man.  He'll be nice about it, but he's not going to put up with shit. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, but he can also be a motherfucker.  I mean, he can also be very harsh.  I remember from YSP, it's like, you know, the station did well because he fucking, he knew  what he was doing.  He's a hammer.  I can't wait till tomorrow.  Bright and early.  Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in the morning.  Yeah.  They're going to be here.  You're going to walk in, fucking Sal's going to have like a nice rag.  He's going to be polishing the chair.  Sit down, boss.  I'm telling you, Sal, if you've heard anything, do it for yourself. 
[00:55:00]  You should work really hard for yourself.  Like that production piece you did, which was awful and we made fun of it.  The, the, um, it was about Roland, I think.  Oh.  Get.  The.  Panda.  Angry!  Panda.  No.  Is that a lion?  I'd start going.  Panda.  That was a panda? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Angry.  But even though that was fairly disastrous and showed tremendously low ability level,  it is memorable.  And it was your thing.  So you should be doing that constantly.  Like making production.  It's like part of fucking like, you know, I, I, I flop.  If I go to get a picture of somebody later, and I don't get it.  I can either fucking slink away and not ask people or fucking own it and make fun of it.  You should do the same shit.  You should be doing more production. 
[00:56:00]  And if it stinks, we will absolutely play it.  Don't make it bad on purpose.  Cause that would, that would be obvious.  Yeah.  But if it's funny, it's funny.  And if it's lousy, you use it, but you should be fucking just constantly doing stuff like  that.  Like when me and Steve started doing the inventor and Epstein.  Oh, of course.  And you guys destroyed it.  Yeah.  And then we immediately went into the studio to record like five more.  The classics.  I fucking love those stupid things.  Yeah.  They grew on you.  The office mandate was, uh, if you come up with something in the office,  you have to make it a production. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So anytime I would be silly in the office, I would be forced into a production studio to  do characters.  But that's what you do.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  It's like, and if it's shitty, there's going to be something that gets, that there's going  to be something mindable in it or, or funny in it.  It's better to get shit upon for doing bad work than it is for not showing up.  I mean, for not doing, not doing any work or for blending in and just being one of the  fucking.  None of you liked the Ramon bit the first time.  No.  Really?  Yeah.  All three of you were like, what the fuck is this?  Probably, yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Like, this makes no sense.  I miss Ramon.  Yeah.  Ramon.  Ramon.  And in fairness, it was a mediocre bit.  It made no sense.  No.  But then it grew on us.  It did.  We're not talking about Jimmy doing Ramon, by the way.  No.  Steve doing Ramon.  Yeah, Steve.  Ramon.  Yeah, Ramon.  Just idiocy.  It was utter idiocy.  Wipe the shit from my shoes.  No context to it.  None.  Yeah.  But Steve could be creative when he was in that right mindset in a production. 
[00:57:30]  Steve was a good production guy.  He was very creative.  Steve had no fear of failing.  No.  No.  Because he enjoyed his character.  So much.  That he didn't care if you liked him or not.  Exactly.  He was having a good time with it.  Dang it.  And that's what you gotta find, man.  That's what you guys should be doing behind the scenes all the time.  Because that's the stuff that's memorable.  Even if it's really funny, it's gonna last.  And if it stinks, we'll get stuff out of it.  Of course.  And we'll mock it.  And you stand there.  It would rather be in the barrel for putting in a piece of shit production that we can goof on. 
[00:58:00]  Than for like, where the fuck were you?  You're not here.  You know.  I'm just thinking about Steve and his production now.  I can't tell you how many times I was in that production booth.  And he wanted me to do something.  And he's just giggling like an idiot.  And I'm like, I don't know if this is gonna work.  And he's just the happiest person with what he's come up with.  No, no, no, no.  This is great.  Do it.  Well, that bit about the, uh, you're in my fucking house.  That bit stunk.  With Wild Bill, right?  It's a terrible bit. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's hideous.  It's poorly written.  It means nothing.  It was dumb.  But there was something very funny in it.  And we found something funny in it.  Because you're in my fucking house.  Oh, it was abysmal, dreadful radio bit.  You didn't like it?  No, it was terrible.  Well, now we gotta play that bit.  We certainly did.  We have that later on.  Yeah, we should have that in the lab.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, I guess, um, I guess that's it. 
[00:59:00]  Beginning of the show, you know.  Like, do you guys have any, like, do we have any, like, what, like, what stuff?  We have Rich Little in studio today.  Ooh.  Who's a fucking legend in my generation?  We know him.  Do we have any of his stuff pulled?  Like, anything from Rich Little's moments?  Or, like, little stuff like that?  Not that we would absolutely use him.  But, you know, and we have Michael Shannon from Boy Walk Empire.  Like, do we have any, like, little momentary cool clips of him?  The guy's a fucking brilliant actor.  Just go with the Rich Little.  I mean, you know, we should have had something prepared that we could play in a break right here.  Yeah.  Going, hey, Rich Little's coming in and he did this once. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, you hear him doing this on Carson.  He probably did fucking 100 Carsons.  Yeah, like 20-something Carsons.  Oh, I was off by 80, but you know what I mean.  We can't have those discussions if half the staff is showing up at 550.  Yeah.  Like, you want to make yourself indispensable where if, like, you're not here and that stuff doesn't get done, we notice.  Why isn't that fucking, how come we don't have this stuff going on?  Or just take it upon yourself.  You know what, I know Rich Little's coming in.  I don't know.  I did some research. 
[01:00:00]  I saw some YouTube clips you might be interested in.  And here it is just in case.  Yeah.  Boom, done.  Oh, what's he doing?  Oh, it's Johnny Cash.  Let me hear him doing Johnny Cash.  Rich Little as Johnny Cash.  I mean, time hasn't been kind to Rich Little.  Well, you know, it's been a long run.  But, I mean, at the time, everyone thought he was amazing.  And then you look back and you realize maybe the impressions weren't that great.  Well.  Could you start from the beginning?  Sorry.  Yes.  Rich Little, who's coming in today doing Johnny Cash. 
[01:00:30]  Let's see how good this is.  Hello.  I'm Johnny Cash.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  You all know how I feel about trains.  Those great iron horses that brought this nation together on gleaming ribbons of steel.  That's fucking good.  That's pretty damn good.  Just shut my fucking mouth.  Pulling cargo from Maine to California.  It's really weird when an impressionist, if we find one bad one they do, that's the one that sticks in the mind.  I know. 
[01:01:00]  This is good.  Hey, look, you're under coming, coming down that rear wheel track.  Hey, look, you're under coming.  Oh, it's wacky.  Wacky video.  Yeah, they're showing trains crashing.  It's a orange blossom special, bringing my baby back.  Holy shit.  That's not bad.  Damn.  That's pretty damn good.  Fuck.  Pretty damn good.  Oh.  Food's coming down the hall, so why don't we take a break? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  We got a really busy show today.  A lot of people.  What do we got?  UFC middleweight champ, Chris Weidman.  Fuck yeah.  He's from Long Island.  Long Island guy, man.  Long Island guy doing made good.  We like that.  We like that a lot.  And Michael Shannon, who is in Boardwalk Empire.  Right.  Who is he?  He plays the guy who was the cop at one point.  Yeah.  He's fucking great.  He was in that Ray Liotta movie.  He played.  Yes, he was the Iceman.  The Iceman.  He played the Iceman.  Right. 
[01:02:00]  See, I'm really looking forward to him coming in studio, because I want to see if he's like  out of his mind.  If he's crazy.  Because he's so crazy on Boardwalk Empire.  Yeah, and he was crazy in Iceman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He might just be crazy.  Might be crazy.  He's really good, man.  Maybe he's not really acting that much.  Yeah.  He's in the new Superman.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's crazy like that guy from No Country for Old Men crazy.  Javier Bardem?  Yeah, yeah.  You look at him and you'd be like, this guy's just fucking crazy.  Yeah, you put a little Hansel haircut on that guy.  Yeah.  And he is nuts. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, wow.  They said he's going to play possibly, we'll ask him this, Elvis Presley in a movie about  the meeting that Elvis had with Richard Nixon in 1970.  You're going to do a horror movie about the meeting?  It's going to be very short.  It's going to be a lot about driving.  Elvis gets traffic.  Make a lift right here.  And also, podcast number 20 is up today.  The Opinion Athlete Podcast, a new episode every Wednesday.  This week, it's Stalker Patty getting high.  Yeah, this was a good one.  Because instead of going like a Best of Stalker Patty, we wanted to go with this because it's 
[01:03:00]  nice and long, but Joe Rogan's in for it.  Nice.  I think it was one of Ari Shaffir's first appearances.  Nice.  Didn't Ari show his ball bag?  He showed his dick.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, he pulled his dick out of his pants and we all pretended we couldn't see it.  We gave Patty a breath strip.  Right.  And Rogan looked at her like, you know that there's marijuana on that, right?  That's a THC strip.  And she started freaking out.  She freaked out, yes.  And she really thought she was high.  Yes.  She was not high, obviously. 
[01:03:30]  No, just Listery.  I don't like this.  Yeah.  A lot of our podcasts featured Joe Rogan in the end, indirectly.  Yeah.  Did a lot of great radio with us.  Baby Bird was Rogan.  A lot of shit, man.  So Rogan's on this one as well, podcast number 20.  Go to our Facebook page, Opin' Anthony.  There should be a link there and you should know how to get it by now, hopefully.  And spread the word because, like I say, every week there are people out there that just  can't afford Sirius XM anymore, unfortunately.  So this is a good way for them to kind of, you know, still be able to listen. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  At least, right?  Yes.  All right.  The Opin' Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill production.  Due to the massive critical acclaim and commercial success of the Than and Sam Show, XM202 is  proud to present a new Opin' Anthony spinoff, a program that will surely take the radio world  by storm, announcing Steve C. and his best friend, Bill, starring Opin' Anthony's own  Steve C. and his best friend forever, Bill the Intern, who is sensible, articulate, and 
[01:04:30]  certainly not crazy.  Hello?  Anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  It's well, condo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was going to cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey, is there a problem?  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Bill, get the fuck out.  Now.  I can't leave. 
[01:05:00]  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again!  The Opin' Anthony Show continues in moments.  Ready?  Ready, time.  One, action.  Action.  Gatorade, is it in you?  Gatorade, is it in you? 
[01:05:30]  Gatorade, is it in you?  That's great.  Wait.  No.  Gatorade.  I got it here.  Is it in you?  Right.  Ready?  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Ready?  Gatorade, is it in you?  No.  Gatorade, is it in you?  Gatorade, Gatorade, is it in you?  Nope.  One more time.  Try the last way you just said, just conversational. 
[01:06:00]  Gatorade, is it in you?  All right.  Ready?  Gatorade, is it in you?  Gatorade, Gatorade, is it in you?  Gatorade, Gatorade, is it in you?  Okay.  Ready?  Gatorade, is it in you?  No.  Don't like that.  Gatorade, is it in you?  Okay.  Gatorade, is it in you?  It is.  You did a couple great ones.  It's serious, serious accents. 
[01:06:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Old Jordan.  Because 12 years ago, he announced that he was coming back to basketball.  Oh.  And Miley Cyrus were in the 23.  You know.  That latest video of hers.  Me and Opie were watching a little of that this morning.  Wow.  And I want to not like her. 
[01:07:00]  I want to not like the way she looks.  I want to make fun of her with the twerking shit from the MTV Awards.  But then she's in that fucking video.  She looks smoking.  She's kicking Lady Gaga and Katy Perry's ass as far as attention goes.  She knows exactly what she's doing.  And all these talking heads on TV thinking she's got issues.  But no, I think she kind of knows what she's doing.  Bieber in the face, though.  That's the creepiest part.  No, she's starting to look.  Bieber with makeup.  Yeah, she's starting to look like a lady boy.  A lady boy. 
[01:07:30]  I think she's going for like a weird lady boy look.  Yeah.  And I think, you know, you can feel okay about that.  Because that says more to the femininity of Justin Bieber than it does.  Right.  Exactly.  The masculinity.  Yo, Bieber looks tougher these days with those tattoos.  Let's not forget.  Oh, man.  And he's got a little mustache going.  He knows what he's doing.  He wears his pants down below his ass.  Yeah.  That's the most precedent.  What song is she rapping in?  Miley Cyrus?  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Where she's wearing the 23.  Yeah.  Is it new?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:08:00]  No, it's very new.  It's extremely new.  I think it hit yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  It's fucking pretty hot.  It's very hot.  What's the new Miley Cyrus song?  Come on.  Wrecking Ball.  No, not that one.  Oh, this isn't her song.  I know.  It's somebody else's song.  No, she's doing a little rap for somebody else.  Anybody?  No?  I think I got it.  It just hit today.  Or yesterday. 
[01:08:30]  I've been running these meetings for quite a while.  And you're just sort of in the background.  Oh, yeah.  I think you know what I'm talking about here.  Oh.  Jim, listen.  I got to call you back.  These kids.  All right.  Oh, God.  Good actor.  I hate this shit.  Just get to the song.  Come on.  A little story.  Drama.  Yeah, who is it?  Oh, I saw Miley's eyes.  Whose video is this, Sam?  Well, it's...  Uh...  Mike Will made it?  Yeah, Mike... 
[01:09:00]  Mike Will made it.  And it's featuring Miley Cyrus and Juicy J and Wiz Khalifa.  I don't know why Mike Will made it, but I know Juicy J and Wiz, obviously.  She's fucking hot.  Yeah, she is.  Miley Cyrus?  Yes.  Yes.  She looks like Dolph Lundgren now.  But I still fuck her.  She just shouldn't have worn those plastic fucking bottoms.  Or latex, whatever the hell it was.  Tension.  Man.  Fresh man.  Hiley Cyrus is kind of what's up right now. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, she's...  Yeah.  That was a great move.  Oh, my...  Jesus Christ.  She's just fucking...  She's in these little shorts and...  Her little Chicago Bulls outfit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Hmm?  Yeah, this is...  She's very sexy.  I'd kiss her bottom.  You would? 
[01:10:00]  What part?  Where'd this shit come down?  She's rapping.  Look out.  Oh, shut up.  Keep your mouth shut unless you're fucking...  Got a cock going in it.  Exactly.  I hate the wigger speak.  It's...  I know, like, it's hard to do rap unless you are doing the wigger speak, but... 
[01:10:30]  It's so annoying.  Just do the chorus.  What?  What happened?  I haven't heard a word.  It's all...  Yeah.  She's fucking hot in this.  She does look really good in this video.  My God.  All right.  We're just watching shit now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Who else?  Just put that on the Facebook page.  Does that just hit, I guess, overnight or yesterday or something?  Yeah.  She's helping out this dude. 
[01:11:00]  She's rapping a little bit, and she's in this really ridiculous, skimpy, 23 Chicago Bulls uniform.  Barely any material.  Crazy.  How about that?  You know the whole Sal thing?  Sal?  There's a story in the paper.  About Sal?  No, I don't know.  I know where all this shit is coming from.  Where we got to protect everybody, and, you know, we don't want anyone to be sad or bullied or...  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  Called names.  Mm-hmm.  And this is why these kids are growing up like this.  Mm-hmm.  I truly believe.  Absolutely.  Because they're never told anything negative.  When we were told negative shit growing up, we're like, oh, fuck, we got to change our fucking tune.  Yeah.  We got to figure some shit out.  Now it's all positive reinforcement.  They're scared to be negative toward a kid.  Any negativity they want to keep away, and that's part of life.  You're going to just fucking...  Take all of his weaponry away. 
[01:12:00]  I don't understand it, because, you know, when you get into the workforce, it's not going to be the same shit.  Oh, yeah.  And so these kids are going to be completely surprised, like, what the fuck is happening?  They're not going to know any better.  Something like today happens, and they feel like their pants are around their ankles, and they have no idea, because they're not used to being talked that way.  Well, today's little story, they're trying to get a mercy rule going as far as, you know, kids playing football.  Now, here's the mercy rule.  A $200 fine at California Youth Football League. 
[01:12:30]  It's bringing protest, because I've already learned in my just only a couple weeks having a kid in school that it absolutely is the minority that wants this shit to go down.  But for some reason, the majority's voice is not being heard.  So they continue to listen to the minority.  At least one parent in the California Youth Football League is throwing a flag at the new enforcement of a $200 fine and possible suspension of any coach who allows his team to win a game by 35 points or more. 
[01:13:00]  That's fucking ridiculous.  I played sports growing up.  You got your ass kicked sometimes.  Yeah.  Yes.  And it was kind of a bummer.  To take a tough loss.  But if you really took that sport seriously, it made you try harder.  Or it also made you go, you know what I mean?  Maybe the same for me.  I don't really want to fucking play football.  I'm going to try to find something that I'm good at.  And it's going to affect how these guys coach games.  Let's say you go up to 28-0 in the first quarter, which can happen. 
[01:13:30]  One turnover and three touchdowns.  What are you supposed to do now?  Not play for three more fucking quarters?  What if somebody fumbles right there by your goal line and the guy picks it up and he's like, I can't run in.  Right.  What do you do?  Exactly.  I'm just going to fucking stand here.  Well, I told you an old story.  My nephew was playing a lot of football.  And at a very young age, if they were up by a certain amount of points in this league out east,  they had to sit the defense.  So now you've got kids that aren't trying as hard when they're in the game because if they do so well, 
[01:14:00]  the penalty is that they have to sit.  That's fucking ridiculous.  So then, of course, you're going to get kids going, well, fuck, I guess we've got to let them score here  because I don't want to just sit now for doing my job well on the football field.  Kelly McHugh, whose 13-year-old son is a kicker for the Sutter Huskies,  he said the risk of fines has hurt the teenage players' development.  Yeah, of course, because they're afraid their coaches are going to get suspended  and they're not going to have a coach to come out here and play football. 
[01:14:30]  Who thought that rule up?  One stupid parent because their kid went home sad.  That kid sucks.  That's how it happens.  Because the parent doesn't know how to handle a sad kid.  And we've said it before.  It's like you've just got to teach somebody that losing is not a big deal.  Like, that's the important thing.  Ah, you got your ass kicked.  Here's why it's not a big deal.  It's only a game.  Like, you lost.  It's okay.  Teach people to fucking lose with some dignity and how it doesn't really matter.  And that prepares you for fucking life. 
[01:15:00]  Well, at work now, doesn't the boss come around to everybody's, like, presentation  on something that they're supposed to do in the office and say that they're all very good?  No!  And not pick just one, maybe?  Oh, really?  No.  It doesn't happen?  It does not, Anthony.  It's a bag.  It's a bag.  I mean, yeah.  Translate to one employee kicking ass.  All right.  We got to slow him fucking down and bring up everybody else.  Of course that's not going to happen in the workplace.  So he's going to be like, what happened?  You're not doing these kids any favors. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  The world is fucking tough.  It's a tough place.  They don't care how tough the world is.  So you prepare them for the tough place by bringing them up as wimps.  Yeah.  The preparation for life is not very good these days.  Oh, boy.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  And you got one of these stories almost every day now.  They should take the curve off, too, though.  Because in fairness, academically, we all got, like, that little curve.  Yeah.  Which is kind of the same thing as don't run up the score.  You know?  Like, they should take that out, too. 
[01:16:00]  It's like, if you get a 7, you get a 7.  If you get a 93, you get a 93.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Florentine was just in talking about this as well.  You know?  And in the NFL, coaches get fucking pissed off because they want to continue running their  offense because it's early in the season.  But the other coach thinks, oh, you're just running up the score on my team.  And they get mad.  No, I'm playing.  How about you fucking do the same?  Right.  Motherfuckers.  Right.  Because it's still early.  I'm trying to figure out some offense shit here.  But they're not allowed to.  So you see that.  And even in NFL games, what?  Those guys can't handle it?  It's not my problem. 
[01:16:30]  Your team stinks.  Right.  They should bring a picture of Frank Reich from the fucking Buffalo Bills to these  meetings.  Oh, Frank was better?  Greatest comeback in NFL history.  And it's rare that that happens, but it does happen.  Just the Houston Oilers.  Weren't they down 35-0?  Something like that.  Yeah, a lot of people get confused and think it was Jim Kelly because he was the starting  quarterback back then when they hear about the greatest comeback in NFL history.  And no, it was Frank Reich, the backup.  Reich.  Came back from, I think it might have been even more than 35.  I'm not sure. 
[01:17:00]  The North California Federation Youth League told the station that the rules were toughened  because last year alone there were 30 instances in which the mercy rule was violated.  Violated?  Who cares?  You're violated the mercy rule.  Plus, I guess we forgot that ice cream cures everything, too.  Right.  You get a sad kid, you talk to him for a few minutes, and like, yeah, you give him a little  tussle, go, let's get an ice cream code.  Watched the Bad News Bears, and once they were at the pizza place, they didn't give a 
[01:17:30]  shit that they got their asses kicked on the field.  Here we go.  Phones are lit.  Oh.  Because everyone's dealing with that.  Sal taking the calls?  Sure hope so.  Kevin in Illinois.  Everyone deals with this shit.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Yeah, I'm a coach for a junior football tackle team, seventh graders.  My son's on the team, and we play the game.  By the way, I've got to interrupt you.  You sound like a football coach.  You've got that cadence, you know.  Hey.  My son plays.  You know why?  Because this really pisses me off. 
[01:18:00]  It's bullshit.  Right.  We were up.  They kicked off to us.  Our kid returned it for a touchdown.  Opening drive.  Right there.  Touchdown.  We kick off to them.  They come out.  Bring their offense off.  The first throw the quarterback does right to the same kid who scored a touchdown for us.  Intercepts the ball, right back down for a touchdown.  First 30 seconds, we're up 14-0.  Right.  The coaches started bitching immediately on the other team, and our board even came down on us and said,  Hey, you guys got to stop this.  Really?  Because the coach over there, two fluke plays that we run two touchdowns back, and they bitch about it? 
[01:18:30]  Come on.  This is getting ridiculous.  And it's not just our team.  It's other teams in our organization.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeez.  I mean, in the story, one of the coaches says, it's difficult to tell a player not to give it 100%.  This is what it comes down to.  But he said, it is the price to pay for an opposing player not being demoralized.  No, it's not.  Sometimes you'll be demoralized.  Right.  That's what you learn. 
[01:19:00]  That's the lesson in sports, is if you feel like you've lost, A, you shouldn't be demoralized.  And if you are temporarily, here's what you do.  You get out of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Find something else you do.  Prioritize.  It's not that important.  Finally found something.  You do well.  Do you think the China people are doing this shit?  No.  Of course not.  I've been saying it for years.  The Chinese are coming.  Oh, man.  The world is extremely competitive, and it's becoming very small.  So I guess we've got to raise our kids to be fucking wimps, because that's how they're 
[01:19:30]  going to compete in the future.  It's just gearing up this country to be even worse than it is now with these fucking pussies.  And you know what?  When I was playing sports, it was a lot easier to sleep at night when you got your ass kicked.  You know, when you got destroyed, you slept very well.  It was when you lost those very close games that kept you up at night.  Yeah.  Well, that was the Friday night, the high school football game, the high school my kids are  going to go into.  They won the game 50-0. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  It happens.  If I go back to our board and I say, look, I've got a seventh grader, and you're bitching  on us for being up 14 points in the first 30 seconds, well, what would the high school  do when we were kicking our ass 50-0?  Did they pull anybody out?  Did they change who plays where?  Well, according to this article, they're saying most high school programs have a mercy  rule.  It's up there.  One, I just threw the article away, but one, it's like 45 points, I think, if you're  up 45 points.  Yeah, I saw 35 points was one of them.  I think the California was 35 points, which is absolute bullshit. 
[01:20:30]  I think it should be three points.  You can only win by a safety.  But Kevin, I've changed my tune, because for a while there, I really thought that parents  were getting soft.  I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with parents?  Yeah, yeah.  And now that I'm in it just a little bit right now, I've already noticed that it absolutely  is the minority, and most of the parents are like, what the fuck are you doing?  Just one fucking or two idiots.  Right.  Yeah.  I've been on shitty teams.  I've been on really good teams. 
[01:21:00]  It kind of, in a weird way, it balances out in the end if you really, you know, decide  you want to play sports.  Mm-hmm.  That's what it boils down to.  If you enter that arena, you're going to, you know, you're going to get, oh, whatever,  I just fucking, Jesus.  All right, guys.  You know why I repeat it, though?  It's so frustrating.  Yeah.  It just doesn't seem to be the right thing to do.  There's no stopping it.  I don't know.  I asked my brother, I'm like, why are they coming off the field?  Oh, well, you see, the team's up by too much, so now we can't play our defense until they 
[01:21:30]  catch up.  I'm like, what?  What?  It doesn't make any sense.  So then my poor nephew, who at the time was a pretty good football player, he's moved  on to a couple other sports, because I think he doesn't want to have, you know, concussions  by the time he's, concussion problems by the time he's 15.  He had to sit there and wait.  And then the other team absolutely did catch up, and then they were able to bring their  real defense back in.  How is that showing which team is the better team and the better players? 
[01:22:00]  And I don't know.  I don't know.  It just seems counterproductive to everything.  Let's say hi to Ben in North Carolina.  Ben.  Morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Hey, I'm in North Carolina.  My son's school has got a first-year high school varsity team, and we've taken some pretty  bad beatings already.  But they have a rule here that if the score is more than 35 points, they play a running  clock.  The only time the clock will stop is if somebody calls a timeout. 
[01:22:30]  So an incomplete pass or a play out of bounds, the clock will continue to run.  They just get it over with.  They're just trying to get it over with fast.  Exactly.  They still play the four quarters of football, but because the score is so out of hand, they  just let the clock run continuously.  I don't like it, but it's not as bad as the other fucking...  It's not as bad.  It's not as bad.  At least you get to fucking continue with your starting lineup, if you feel like it.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, we were down 42-6 at the end of the first quarter. 
[01:23:00]  Right.  You want that over in Dublin.  You know what I'm saying?  You don't want to sit there and watch them beat up on you for another three quarters.  Yeah, but your field goal kicker must have been happy, because he did well.  Unless he's the asshole that missed, and that's why it was six.  Yeah.  Yeah, they missed a two-point conversion.  Oh, okay.  They're trying to catch up down 42-0.  They went for two.  I was a scrub on one basketball team, and I always sat there on the bench hoping they  ran up the score, because that meant I was finally going to come in. 
[01:23:30]  Going to get in?  Yes.  They'll take all their other players out?  Yeah.  And then, you know, the ass-beating would continue, but at least I felt like I was part of the team.  You're out there.  Going to make the big comeback.  I started rooting for the other team after a while.  Like, okay, another few points.  I know I'm getting the call.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  All right, man.  You know, I was thinking of this recently, what we're talking about right now, and I  tried to look at the other side.  I'm like, is there anything?  Again, I have no kidding.  Is there anything to be said for, like, what we're saying is, like, you have to teach someone 
[01:24:00]  how to lose.  But then is there anything on the other side which says that the more important thing  is not, it's like, who cares if you're better at this than the other guys are?  The more important thing is everybody kind of taking care of each other.  It was just a thought I had.  I think you can learn that and teach that, like, earlier in their age, you know, at home  and, like, really, like, preschool and kindergarten.  I think by the time you're playing football, I think a kid understands that, you know, you're 
[01:24:30]  going to lose some things.  You're not going to get everything you want.  You can't cry about that.  So, yeah, I see what you're saying.  Is there something to that?  But I think that information is imparted to kids earlier than when they're, before they  start playing football.  It comes down to this, man.  Parenting is a motherfucker.  Oh.  I'm in it.  Is that a new book out there?  I would have that.  I would fucking put it out there.  You should.  And if I need the asterisk, I'll go with it.  I don't care. 
[01:25:00]  Do you know how many that would sell, dude?  That's an amazing title.  Parenting is a motherfucker.  It's not easy.  It's a really hard job.  And a lot of people have, you know, decide to tap out because it is too hard.  So then they expect the community and the school and everything else to do these type  of things because they don't want to deal with it.  They just don't want to deal with it.  Yeah.  I don't know how bad it was to where they got to come up with these new wacky things.  Maybe because, you know, when we were growing up, you didn't have both parents working. 
[01:25:30]  I don't know.  So maybe that helped a little bit.  Who knows?  I don't know where this started.  I have no idea.  That might be part of it.  You know, but.  They want the schools to do more of their fucking jobs because both parents are working.  Like, my kid starts school.  He's like two weeks in.  And, you know, there's something called separation.  So the parents kind of stay in the classroom until they feel like their kid's ready so you  could leave.  So you sit there and you watch.  And to see your kid, like, trying to, like, socialize with other kids and they won't have 
[01:26:00]  it yet, it fucking breaks your heart.  And then, you know, you go home with a kid and you, even though he's only three, I already  am having these little discussions with him.  You know, it's tough.  I know it's tough.  You know, but I think other parents see that and go, well, fuck, I demand that you make  that kid play with my kid.  You know, it'll happen eventually.  And actually, now that we're a couple weeks in, it is starting to happen.  But at first, it was like, holy fuck.  I saw him in the gym just trying to, like, socialize with kids and a kid dropped the 
[01:26:30]  ball.  So he got all excited, picked up the ball and handed it back to this one kid thinking  in his three-year-old mind, here's my moment.  Maybe I can make a new friend or at least play a little bit.  Kid yanks the ball out of his hand and runs away.  And my heart just sinks.  Oh, what an asshole.  But, you know.  Little fuckwad.  But I understood it, but it still hurts because it's your kid.  And my kid, to his credit, he has a smile on his face and he goes on to the next thing,  you know.  And then a little girl dropped her dumb stuffed animal because she has to go to school 
[01:27:00]  with a stuffed animal.  And he handed it back to her.  And the same thing, yanking it out of his hand.  What would have been great is if you yelled at your son in front of everybody and said,  never pick up the ball for a Jew.  Just gave him a terrible life lesson.  Holy shit.  That's so fucked up that they even have that thing where the parents are able to go there.  Because I've told the story before with kindergarten when mommy dropped me off at kindergarten the  first day and Miss Mulder, it was Miss Mulder. 
[01:27:30]  She was from Holland and she was the teacher.  And she comes to the door of Cuba Hill Elementary School and she takes my hand and I start walking  in the hallway and I turn around like, hey, mom.  And she's like walking to the car.  I fucking let out like the blood curdling scream and Miss Mulder is trying to like hold me back.  And mom just went.  And she said, she goes, she knew I was going to be a fucking disaster. 
[01:28:00]  Old pissy eyes started early.  See, Ant's not a good example for what we're saying, though.  Because like you turned out brilliantly funny.  But let's be honest, not exactly the example of emotional.  All right, I'm a little busted.  Looking at your three-year-old son, do you look at Anthony and go, this is where I want  him to be emotionally?  I cried my first day, too, and my mom had to come and get me.  Yeah.  So they came up with this thing called separation.  So they give you a little time.  Oh, OK.  Now, I mean, to the credit of all the parents and the kids in this particular classroom, 
[01:28:30]  we're all gone now.  They ease you into it, huh?  Now it's like so long and they're good.  But, you know, you're not sure, too, about it.  Oh, man.  But is it is it working?  All of this stuff that they're trying, like every generation, we get progressively a little  softer.  And I'm not saying that's even bad.  I don't know.  It goes back to like, you know, every generation really believes they're the the generation.  Right.  And every other generation just sucks a dick. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  It's in a lyric, too.  Oh, fuck.  Whatever.  I'll come up with it.  Meanwhile, none of us.  No, no.  The quote is every generation wants to be the last generation.  Right.  Because they don't they think, you know, they got it all figured out.  Yeah.  Andy in Boston.  Listen to this one.  Andy.  Go ahead, Andy.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Yeah.  I was a coach of a eight year old soccer team.  Sorry. 
[01:29:30]  Me, too.  I'm lucky guy, aren't I?  I was a coach for about five years for a local youth league.  And we finished the game one day and one of the kids asked me if we had won or we had  lost.  Yeah.  Because the kids don't even know anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they can't even like bury that shit.  So I told I told one of the kids that we had lost and told them the score that, you  know, we'll get them next week.  I got a call later on that afternoon from the commissioner of the league saying that 
[01:30:00]  my services were no longer required.  And this was an elite that was short of coaches in the first place.  And they had begged me to come back.  So I pretty much told them to pound sand that, you know, eight year olds can't handle winning  and losing.  Pound sand.  What were you supposed to tell the kid?  Like, hey, did we win or lose?  What were you supposed to say?  I think that it was going on as you played your best and it was, you know, it was a  tie. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, well.  Some of the kids there knew that, you know, we were getting their butts handed to them.  Yeah.  Andy, are you in one of those leagues where they don't keep score?  That's in quotations, obviously, because everyone else is.  That, that was, uh, that, that was the, that was, uh, uh, that was one of the things that  they kind of told you to do, but there's leagues now they don't keep score, but of course the  parents are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The parents know because they come from a place where it did matter what the score was. 
[01:31:00]  And then the kids get a little confused because they're not really paying that close attention.  So I, uh, uh, this is one of the leagues where, you know, all the kids get to play.  So you have about 25 kids on each team and, you know, some are picking their nose in the  corner while other ones are running around.  Some are spinning around in the outfield.  Jimmy, what are you, a ballerina?  Oh, no, I'm not.  Good moment.  Good, good, good moment.  You know what?  I'm suddenly for all this. 
[01:31:30]  Thanks, Andy.  But imagine, uh, a kid doing that today.  Uh, the, you know, the coach.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  He's not allowed to say, are you a ballerina?  Ballerina.  Sexually shaming him?  Right.  Let me go to Ryan, who's a drill sergeant in Georgia.  Ryan.  Hey, guys.  Hey, can we, can we send Sal and E-Rock down to you for a nice week of, uh, drill sergeant?  If he needs a couple, if he needs to lose a couple pounds, I can burn it off of him.  Hey, uh, real quick though, with this, I've kind of conducted my own social experiment. 
[01:32:00]  And I've seen a lot of kids come through, obviously, uh, these newer, this newer generation.  And I got to tell you, you guys couldn't be more right on.  I see about like 10% of them that got beat up by their parents or their parents beat them  when they were kids, you know, that spanked them on the butt or smacked them in the face.  Those kids have really, uh, I mean, those kids can deal with anything.  Uh, Charlie Sheen's idea of what a GI was dealing with the rain, the muck, all the crap  that you have to get beat up with in the military.  That, those guys are the ones that make it in the military. 
[01:32:30]  These new kids is Nintendo generation.  And these kids that just want to play games and be fat and not do anything.  Those kids do not make it.  And every single one I've seen, the ones that have failed have been the ones that were not  beat by their parents.  And the ones that made it were the ones that were beat by their parents.  He's like, he likes a good beating.  But see, uh, he said Nintendo because he, he's so into what he's doing.  He has no idea.  Doesn't even know.  Right.  I understood what you were saying there.  Of course.  Of course.  I played GTA 5.  So, I'm pregnant on that one. 
[01:33:00]  That one rocks.  I just know in our stupid business that, that it's changed with the new kids coming up.  And somewhere along, I think it was when we came back to satellite, there was a big difference.  But certainly in the last five years or so.  When I started radio, I was sleep deprived because all us low level guys would pretty  much stay at the radio station 16 hours a day.  And, and when people tapped out and finally went home to sleep, that was your break.  Yeah.  They finally needed you for something, you know, but if we were all there, they're just  like, they're, they're picking a guy. 
[01:33:30]  So you would stay there as long as fucking possible.  I used to just wander around, go in.  I used to go into everyone's office, see what they did, see if I could help, even if  it was something I didn't want to do in the future.  But I thought that little, I thought that little relationship might lead to something,  you know, it finally got me to Brother Weez.  Brother Weez didn't want anything to do with me at first, but I, I, I was a pain in the  ass until he finally said, all right, fuck.  I'm just looking at it this way.  I've been in the army for 17 years now, and I've seen just a steady decline of soldiers 
[01:34:00]  and the way they act and what they do.  I'm real happy to retire in two years.  All right.  Can you give me some of that drill sergeant thing?  Hey, yeah, this is one of them.  Hey, you got that?  Hey, you got that?  I also saw a story about, I guess, Toys R Us is getting some shit these days for being  gender specific.  So they, they want to change it.  Like, you know how you go down the pink aisles for the girls' toys and the blue aisles for the 
[01:34:30]  boys' toys and, and the bikes are separated by girls' bikes and boys' bikes.  Someone's all up in arms about this.  And, um.  Once again, yes.  The minority.  Yes.  And wants them to be, uh, gender unspecific so that if you go to buy a bike, the boys'  bikes and the girls' bikes are all in one spot.  And, and, and the, uh, the action figures will be with the girls' dolls and stuff.  Iraq comment.  They have it in the UK.  The stores are, are, don't have a boy's section or a girl's section. 
[01:35:00]  Sure.  They're all mixed together.  They all did it.  Some parent group in the United States thought that was a good idea and had been filing this  petition to get Toys R Us in the, in the United States to do it.  And Toys R Us is saying, we don't promote boys and girls.  They're just in sections by, by product.  It just makes it easy.  It's like, oh, you're looking for a girl's bike.  Let's fucking.  And you know what's going to happen?  Some little boy is going to go into the bike section.  He's going to, this is what would have happened to me.  I would have accidentally bought a girl's bike thinking it was just a bike.  And now I got my ass kicked. 
[01:35:30]  Now you're getting beaten up.  I got, I, I, I, if we're talking about bikes, I've, I've wondered about something.  Yeah.  Shouldn't we have the, the girl bike design?  Of course.  Yeah.  Cause I mean, I think a girl's pussy could take a hit to the, yeah.  It could take a hit by that bar, right?  I don't think they were going for that way back in the old days when they designed that.  But shouldn't we have plenty of that, plenty of room?  You'd think.  They just didn't want girls giving fucking snatch shots back in the day.  Where they had to lift their leg when they're wearing a dress.  Is that, and they had to lift their leg over that bar. 
[01:36:00]  They're giving fucking pussy shots.  That's why they came up with that?  That's exactly why they came up.  No way.  So a girl wouldn't have to un-ladylike lift.  Do you know that for real?  Yeah.  It's absolutely.  Wouldn't have to un-ladylike lift her leg over the bar.  How do you know that?  Because he was around when it was invented.  He's the one buying my big front wheel with a little tiny back wheel bike.  He's the reason they had to change the design.  Yeah.  Sitting there by the bike rack looking for old Concho Peacock.  Fucking sitting there looking at the girls. 
[01:36:30]  I thought it was because the girls wouldn't be able to help themselves and they would have  to rub their vaginas back and forth while they rode their bikes.  Yeah.  I guess because of the strength in construction and just that, the bar on top is better.  It's just a better design for a bicycle.  But for ladies, they had to sweep that down.  That's funny.  They had to get a little leg in there today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That's about it.  Hmm.  Yeah.  So they want to do that.  And like, if a girl wants to buy a Burby doll, I want my Burby. 
[01:37:00]  Why have them have to sort through like where the guy's stuff is and everything next to the  GI Joe's?  No.  You put it in the, and if you're a boy going into Toys R Us to buy something, you can  eliminate half the fucking store.  You won't have to go through it.  The problem is the kids see the toys on TV and they want these ones across genders and  the parents don't want to have to say, well, that's a girl's or that's a boy's.  So if it's all gender neutral, like, hey, no one can say anything. 
[01:37:30]  And there's groups, though, that don't want that to even be said, like that's girls, that's  boys.  Oh, yeah.  They want the child to be able to get a dolly if you're a boy.  And it was a puppet.  It wasn't a doll.  And they want, you know, if a kid wants a pink bicycle, a boy wants a pink bike, he should  be able to do that.  We shouldn't put stereotypes about sex on kids at that age because then they get older  and they, shut up.  Blue bike for the boy.  What's the new generation called? 
[01:38:00]  Millennials?  Millennials, yeah.  Is that real?  Yeah, millennials, yeah.  All right, we got one that wants to defend the rest of the millennials.  Eric, go ahead, buddy.  Hey, guys.  Big fan of you guys.  Of course.  I don't know exactly what you guys want from our generation.  I don't know what you mean by, oh, they don't like to work hard and stuff.  How old are you, Eric, if you don't mind me asking?  23.  Okay.  I guess kind of like Anne's discussion yesterday, I'm not saying every single one of you are  like this, but I feel like a lot more are than our generation, certainly. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, I get that.  But, I mean, it's just, it sounds as if every generation says that about their generation.  Yeah, we said that, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We absolutely said that.  It's true.  Times change, you see something.  I don't know.  We work hard.  I'm in my job right now.  Do you feel that people around the same age as you, around you, are slacking?  That you see a lot of people that are slacking?  Not so much slacking, just not knowing really what to do. 
[01:39:00]  It's almost as if, I don't know, we feel as if everything's not been handed to us, just  everything's been set for us.  And then when we get out there, they're like, all right, now you got to find your, like,  when you're-  Cut your hair and get a job!  But see, that's the result of it.  They don't even, like, show you how to, you know, build your own resume or anything, or  make relationships with people, get a job, or anything like that.  But I think that's because of how you guys were brought up.  Yeah, that's the-  And that's the point we're trying to make today, because then when you get in the real  world, it ain't the same rules.  Yeah, I guess I get that, but like I said- 
[01:39:30]  It sounds like you, it sounds like you're aware, sorry, it sounds like you're aware of  it, and you have figured out a workaround, but you're saying, you're pretty much  saying our, uh, what we've been saying.  Yeah, I guess I am, but-  But it's weird, though, when you look back at the other generations, like, you look at  the World War II generation that they call the greatest generation, and they were very  hard workers, but you know what, like, here's where we're better than them.  They didn't understand anything about post-traumatic stress, they didn't understand anything about  fucking, you know, you can't scream at your kid while you're drinking and expect 
[01:40:00]  them to grow up emotionally healthy.  Hey.  Like, they- but you know what I mean, they did a lot of shitty things that this generation and  our generation is much fucking better at.  So certain things suffer, but there are other things that come out that are, like, I think  in a lot of ways, we're a much better country now than we are in what we're then, because  we do, like, you know, back then, discrimination against people and women, and it was just terrible.  And it was okay to be discriminatory, it was okay to fucking be like that, and now it's 
[01:40:30]  not.  There's certain things that have balanced out, I think, that are better.  Back then, they would just drink and smoke and scream at your kid.  You could literally beat the dog shit out of your kid, and it was fine.  Like, a lot of things we are better at.  I guess, you know, trying to find a balance would be nice.  Yeah, because it's kind of swung in reverse.  Huh?  It's kind of swung-  The only kids that get-  Go ahead.  It's like, it's not a bad thing that kids aren't getting beaten anymore?  I don't know.  No, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, Jimmy made that point.  It's trying to find that balance, I think. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, because it's swung all the way in reverse, and the reason-  It's sad to say the pendulum has swung down.  But the reason nobody knows what they want to do is because, I mean, kids aren't really  pushed to figure that out when they're coming up, because nobody wants to push you and see  you fail at something.  So it's the same thing with sports.  If there's a possibility of failing, we'll just let you pass by.  Just keep sliding by until you get thrown out into the real world, and you're like,  well, I don't know.  I don't really want to do it, so I'm not going to.  Part of our progress, and it is weird, is we are becoming a gentler planet or whatever. 
[01:41:30]  With the advanced technology-  See what happened in Kenya.  Oh, yeah.  Excluding certain African malls.  But it's a very slow-  Maybe you should say this another week or two when that starts fading away a little bit.  Yeah, that probably was a very bad week to make the point that we're gentle.  I'm sorry.  What's Mohammed's mother's name?  I don't know.  Sorry, Jimmy.  No, but I think that's the intent of what we're doing here.  It's like, it's just, with the technology and all this, it just seems like everything is becoming a little bit gentler. 
[01:42:00]  People are trying to, because we still have a tribal mentality, even though we're advanced and smart.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not as much about what it used to be, but it's still tribal.  We still don't look at ourselves as a planetary unit, which Dr. Kaku says we probably need to do before we really advance into science.  That's so out of the realm of fucking, like, thinking about.  Like, now you can't even imagine the world, like, fucking thinking as one.  Get out of here.  But more now you can than you could a hundred years ago, I'm sure.  We got a Generation X that wants to talk to the millennial. 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  Jen in Rhode Island, you're on with Eric in Baltimore.  Hi.  I'm actually a Gen X, and I train millennials for my company and the management track.  I have an ex-Gen.  I mean, he made a comment, and I'm not attacking him and his comment, but to me, his comment was exactly the kind of thing I hear.  He says, no one taught us how to make a resume. 
[01:43:00]  No one taught us how to find a job.  Well, no one taught me, but we figured it out.  You just found people.  You found someone that did it, and they walked you through it.  Gen Xers, they got shit on, too.  They were called the exact same things millennials were called.  Oh, the lost generation of fucking kids that don't know what the fuck they're doing.  Same fucking shit.  And millennials will say that to their kids.  Oh, you and your iris scans, or whatever.  But Gen Xers, Gen Xers, Gen Xers entered a world after college where everybody was hiring everybody. 
[01:43:30]  Well, there you go.  That's kind of true.  You know, and millennials are entering a world where nobody's hiring anybody.  But the economy hasn't always been great when people get out of college and hire, you know.  And the jobs that these younger people now will be getting will all be in computer.  We're just in a weird, it's a really weird fucking huge change that's been happening.  Yeah.  Come on, robots.  Enough with the robots.  It's not good.  Love a robot.  I love robots. 
[01:44:00]  They rule.  With the jobs I'm training them for, they get a company car.  And, you know, it's just a sturdy, it's like a sturdy Acura item.  What are they?  They're limo drivers.  And I've had kids say, oh, I don't bring my company car out on the weekend.  I don't want people to know that I drive that.  I'm like, what?  You're giving a car.  You don't even need your own car.  And they're too embarrassed.  It's like, oh, I can't drive it.  It's not cool enough.  Oh, man.  I just, I don't get that.  Are you going to drink?  Eric, anything before we hang on? 
[01:44:30]  I mean, we all figured it out, too.  I figured it out.  I have a job right now, but I don't know.  I just, like I said, I just don't like the over-sweeping of millennials who don't know  what they're doing now and all these stupid articles on the Wall Street Journal and stuff  about how millennials don't feel like working.  And it's always like the same.  They always talk to like one or two hiring people who have to deal with them and say,  oh, the kids coming out of college now don't know what they're doing.  I can only talk for our little thing here, and I see it. 
[01:45:00]  I really do see it with the millennials.  They're very, very different.  They're sitting around waiting to be told what to do, and they also have this entitlement  that they just want things handed to them immediately.  It is the same thing that was probably said about the 60s, too.  I'm thinking this is the same thing that was said about the 60s generation.  All they want to do is smoke pot and sit around, and now they turn into that.  They're probably sounding like our fucking fathers now.  Give me a few beers.  All right, Eric.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Woo! 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  Fucking Gen Xers with their slobo yelling.  Yeah.  Jesus.  His name ought to be Lado, right or wrong, gang?  Wrong.  Daughter's a race car driver.  Kids do understand winning and losing.  Okay, I'm sure.  Yeah.  In some respects.  Scott.  Yes.  How fast can your daughter drive?  She goes 45 in a dragster, and she's 8 years old.  Aw.  45 miles an hour in a dragster at 8 years old? 
[01:46:00]  Yep.  Holy shit.  Are they already racing at that age?  Yes.  That's when you start, at 8 years old.  Get the fuck out of here.  I didn't know this was going down.  Yeah.  This is all across the country.  Google junior dragsters, and you'll see what it is.  What, is she going to be a top-fueled dragster driver?  She follows him.  Oh, man.  She knows who Courtney Force is.  Yeah, she's pretty hot, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw somebody send me a picture of her.  What's that, John Force's daughter? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  She's got John Force's teeth, too.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Really?  That's a little different.  Force teeth.  Wow.  I love this, Ant.  I used to actually watch a lot of racing on the Nashville network back in the day.  Ooh.  American Sports Cavalcade.  Oh, she's not hot at all.  No?  Oh, boy.  I saw a good picture of her.  Well, the one we just saw was a bad angle.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, that's her?  See, that looks good.  Well, she looks good there.  And for, you know, who you see usually in dragsters.  The side shot was horrendous, but straight on. 
[01:47:00]  I think that's the same girl?  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  I think posing and made up, she looks pretty good.  Is that her?  That's her?  Holy fuck.  She's kind of naked in that.  Wow, wait a minute.  What the fuck?  She's naked.  Does her ass look good, though?  I don't know.  Sam, I can't tell.  Get the picture bigger.  Is it sad that women still have to do that shit?  Because you're not going to get a male race car driver naked to try to sell themselves.  Ah, right?  Well.  That's all right.  It's kind of sad.  My point is, in racing, there's a winner and a loser, especially in drag racing. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  Every round, somebody's going home.  Yeah, yeah.  And the kids learn at an early age that you go shake hands with the person that just beat you.  And they learn that there's a winner and a loser.  And it's not just drag racing.  You've got kart racing.  You've got mini sprint racing.  And all these kids are starting at eight years old.  Some stops at seven years old.  Wow, that's fucked up.  So maybe the thing is to find out one of these more unusual sports for your kid. 
[01:48:00]  Because I think soccer is just evil.  It's an evil sport.  Mars?  Oh, absolutely.  Mars is going to be like UFC.  Get your five-year-old punching each other in the face.  The problem is mostly with team sports.  Because I got my son in judo.  We don't explain winning and losing.  You just know that you lost.  Right.  You feel it.  So we don't have to say you lost.  They just don't want to be pinned anymore.  So they'll come out and they'll come out stronger.  So they understand when they're losing in those type of sports, like individual sports like that. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, it's pretty hard to tell them they tied or won when you just got your ass handed to you.  Yeah, exactly.  There's no way to fucking fake that shit.  Like Mars who was fucking going six rounds with his mom when he was a kid.  Oh, wow.  Damn.  I'm saying that's a real, that's a hard one to, you know.  You're bringing up bad memories.  Sorry, Mars.  Oh, Mars.  That's pretty brutal.  Mars got his jujitsu shirt on.  Yeah, Mars is a fucking minute.  Mommy's not going to fucking beat the shit out of him anymore.  Right, Mars?  I don't know, man.  She's still got weapons. 
[01:49:00]  All right, Scott.  I had no idea eight-year-olds could fucking race dragsters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Google junior dragsters.  I will.  And the top speed is 45 miles an hour.  That's the rule?  That's at eight years old.  Right.  Once you're up to 16-year-olds, I think you can go 79 miles an hour.  Oh, man.  That's wild.  Any while.  In an eighth mile.  All right, Scott. 
[01:49:30]  Thank you so much.  All right.  Have a good one.  All right.  Considering they're fucking pushing, you know.  What are top fuel dragsters doing these days?  300?  Something like that?  It's crazy.  You know, we could go for another hour easily.  330 now?  Fuck.  330 miles an hour?  330 they're doing?  Fuck yeah.  That's fucking insanity.  Fucking easy.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah, I drove a dragster.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  Fucking doing wheelies and stuff.  Wheelies?  You don't want to do a wheelie on a dragster. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah?  How funny was it?  Fucking good.  Yeah, I remember watching when they were breaking the 300 mile an hour barrier.  That's been 330.  Jesus.  Amazing.  Lightweight for space age polymers and alloys.  In the military, we can't kick people out for failing PE tests.  Well, we know that whole world, too.  That doesn't make sense.  Where they've lowered the fucking standards for some of these jobs. 
[01:50:30]  I've seen some cops that you just look at and go, what the fuck business do you have  putting a uniform on?  How do they make uniforms that size?  Like big, fat, fuck cops.  I don't know.  What are you doing?  Should be able to test people.  You have to be physically fit.  Firemen, same thing.  You got to be physically fit to have those types of jobs.  It's a physically fit occupation.  And if you want to turn down a fatso because he's coming in and you say, because you're  fat, lose weight and come back and give it a try, you should absolutely be able to do 
[01:51:00]  that without the threat of a fucking lawsuit and bullshit.  You're too fat.  It's one of those jobs.  That's what you got to do.  Yeah.  I'm not too fat.  Not you.  No.  I did have lucky charms yesterday, though.  Why are you treating yourself?  I will be better today.  Watch them fat fucks at the goddamn tunnel.  Those cops.  Somebody stopped.  Their easy pass doesn't work.  And they lumber over.  Lollygag.  Lumbering.  Like a sloth.  And like, you know, pick it up a little. 
[01:51:30]  There's a line of fucking cars waiting.  Oh, they stink.  You don't think they care about the line of cars?  They don't fucking give a shit about anything.  They're miserable because they're not real cops and they fucking, they stink fuckers.  And open up another fucking lane with less time than a half an hour after they reopen one of the lanes in the Midtown Tunnel.  Then they might swing open another easy pass gate at the toll booth.  Cars are piling out of the tunnel. 
[01:52:00]  They got two easy pass lanes to go to.  And there's at least four or five of them, but they're closed.  But they slowly open them up.  He's right.  Because I did that same commute.  Why would you open them all up, you fucking cocks?  At least 10 or 15 minutes past when they should open them up, they finally open them up.  They're fucking assholes.  And we're paying for that shit.  So make it convenient for us.  We're paying your salaries and we're paying to use the stupid road and the tolls.  They should always all be open easy pass.  What's the fucking problem?  Then they open up the other lane because they have three lanes going inbound and one lane going out in the morning. 
[01:52:30]  And then when I'm coming in, they have to reopen it so it's two in and two out.  And the time it takes for them to clear that tunnel of the inbound traffic and turn it around so that you can now have a, it's amazing.  I'll go through the entire length backed up in traffic in the one lane and you'll pump out, you'll pop out the other end.  And they're just doing nothing.  And there's no more cars coming through.  They could instantly turn that around and open up another lane. 
[01:53:00]  But it just sits there not being used because I don't know.  Because I don't know.  There's no fucking viable reason.  They're a bunch of lazy cunts, the bridge and tunnel fucking authority.  Fuck them.  Yeah, that easy pass shit drives me crazy.  It should be one cash lane for any fucking dummy who refuses to use easy pass.  You should suffer.  You wait online.  You should suffer.  Right.  But I don't want them to know where I'm going. 
[01:53:30]  Exactly.  No.  Meanwhile, they fucking...  Too late for that.  It's too late.  It's too late for all that.  You're all over.  Yeah, believe me, they now have license plate scanners that are amazing.  They're all over.  They're cameras that are on cop cars, on light poles and whatnot.  And they take pictures of your license plate, run it immediately, and file away photographs of your vehicle and the license plate in some giant database.  So that if they ever need to find license plate number, blah, blah, blah, whatever it is, they punch into a computer and they will have where this car has been, where it went from point A to point B to point C. 
[01:54:00]  They know all this shit already.  Don't worry about your dumb easy pass.  That's why I steal my license plates.  Exactly.  You got it, man.  You got to fucking mix that shit up constantly.  They also read easy passes all over the place, not just at the tolls anymore.  There's easy pass readers everywhere.  So if you're driving through the city and they say it's just to map traffic patterns in the city, but it's your easy pass. 
[01:54:30]  It's got a specific number.  They know exactly where you are in the city, where you've been, where you're going, where you stopped, all that shit.  Iraq comment.  There was a news story not too long ago where they, with the easy pass, right dead center of the dashboard, so anything could hit it.  Drove through Times Square, the west side, upper east side, and the amount of times that that thing was getting pinged.  It went off, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they had some little device on it.  It was reading on areas that it shouldn't have been read at.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just read everywhere.  Well, was it possible they confused the easy pass ping with something else, like when radar gets mixed up? 
[01:55:00]  No.  Well, they didn't know.  They had this device hooked right to the easy pass.  Specifically new.  So that it would go off when they came in through the bridge or the tunnel.  Reading the easy pass.  And that same reading was getting hit all throughout the city.  And all of this goes into a giant database that can be used.  You know, we don't know who's using it.  They could say, oh, it's for traffic patterns.  But who the fuck knows who's using it?  And just the fact that the police department has a giant library of photographs of your car and where it is and stuff.  I had one of my cop friends, show me, pulled it up on his iPhone. 
[01:55:30]  He had his iPhone.  He goes, check this out.  He goes to his specific app that's only available to the police and punches it in, punches in my license plate number.  And picture after picture of my truck showed up everywhere, all over the city.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  In front of how many elementary schools?  But, yeah, I don't know if that bothers me or not.  In a way, I understand the principle of it.  But then I'm like, eh, if there's a missing kid or if there's some fugitive. 
[01:56:00]  If they have a license plate on somebody and then they punch that in and see where he's been and what they might get a lead on where he is or, you know, who he knows.  Well, maybe his picture was taken a few minutes ago.  Right, right.  I think we've been broken down.  It doesn't bother me at all anymore.  It used to.  But, I mean, it's too late.  We have been.  And, again, it's always, always under the guise that they're helping you, like the government or the police or whatever.  It's a convenience for you.  Again, oh, we're mapping traffic patterns.  Oh, that's a good thing.  Now they can figure out what makes more traffic and where and divert things or whatever.  But it always ends up that it's something else. 
[01:56:30]  Of course.  It's always used later for something else.  One time.  It's not a guise.  It's not a guise.  It's a gal.  Go ahead.  You have no expectation of privacy in the public.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  But.  And driving is a privilege, not a right.  It is a privilege.  But how about, yeah, well.  Why the sexy horse today, Kenny?  Gun ownership is a right, and that's shit on all the time.  This is what happens when you only get one hour's sleep. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, my God.  Why only one hour's sleep?  I had a piece of work to do last night.  Oh.  Yeah.  Piece of work.  Piece of work.  Oh, boy.  A hit?  No, no, no.  I did something for somebody.  Oh, okay.  Oh, shit.  That thing?  You did that thing for the guy?  That thing next to the joint.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  For the guy.  What kind of work was it?  Oh, man.  Somebody said, I need you to empty these, and they were a pair of balls.  No expectation of privacy. 
[01:57:30]  No.  Is it really no expectation in public?  Wow.  In your vehicle?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  What about expectation of?  That's why if a police officer lawfully stops you, he can ask you to exit your vehicle if you're the driver.  Ooh.  Well.  Let's all talk about Kennedy today.  What if I say no?  Sexy Kennedy.  I get beaten.  I get tased.  Get out of the vehicle. 
[01:58:00]  You don't touch me.  Don't you touch me.  There's nothing better than a video that starts with a large black woman in a vehicle with a cop trying to get her out of the car when he first puts his hands on her.  And she starts, do not touch me.  Where do you find these videos?  You know it's going to end really funny with her doing the chicken on the ground with two wires, two very thin wires coming out of her chest.  Yeah, but now what, no expectation of privacy, but what about what that information is used for? 
[01:58:30]  Now, if it's used in law enforcement or something, but what if it's used for something a little more notorious?  Yeah, but what if shit was candy?  You could eat it.  Well, it wouldn't even have to be candy if you want the truth.  She's a bad example.  What if shit was candy?  The dom wouldn't charge you so much for it.  Time will tell, Anthony.  That's why we have time court system.  That's good.  Our criminal justice system.  Fortunately, it doesn't tell Iraq when to get up and get into work, but see, time will tell. 
[01:59:00]  I was just going to say, Kenny got one hour of sleep?  Yeah, one hour of sleep, but that's my loyal and dedication.  I guess that's why he was late today, right?  Were you late, Kenny?  Oh, no, and I had time to make two stops to get, you know, supplies.  He was extra early, actually.  Wow.  You're loopy right now, right?  We're a little loopy.  I am a little brain dead.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  But you do what you got to do, right, Kenny?  I mean, somebody called me.  That's Kenny's motto, by the way.  You got to do what you got to do.  Yeah, somebody called me.  They said they needed me, so, like, I got to, you do what you got to do.  You do what you got to do.  Kenny's work ethic is much more than most people's.  Like, you know, his work ethic, you can't hold yourself to that standard because he really  is a tremendous work ethic.  I take pride.  Sal's motto is what?  I'll do as long as the subways are running on time. 
[02:00:00]  Sal's got some personal problems.  See, you can't solve the issue until you get to the underlying problem.  Ah, right.  Does it rhyme with shomo sexuality?  What do you think?  What do you mean Sal's got some personal issues?  I don't know.  He's been off his game.  You know what Kenny's doing right now?  Yeah.  He's so loopy that he's bringing up the nonsense that he talks about in the hallway that he just  makes up. 
[02:00:30]  He just makes up stuff every day.  It's like four hours to kill.  And now he's bringing it to the air because he's loopy.  Because he's all fucked up.  Like, he just started the other day going up to Sal and saying, what's wrong?  And I would say nothing.  And he'd go, no, no, no.  You'll say something's wrong.  If you don't want to tell me, that's fine.  It's probably none of my business.  Yeah, yeah.  But you just feel it.  Yeah.  You feel that there's something wrong.  You know.  All right.  I have intuition.  Certainly do.  I got to play a little something for everybody.  Thanks, Kenny.  Oh, what do you got?  It's fun. 
[02:01:00]  A little fun.  Oh, I like fun.  Joe is a lot of fun.  It is, right?  I think I have rupees in my wallet right now.  From your trip?  You've got a rupee in your wallet.  I think I do.  That sounds a little, you've got to be kidding.  There is the rupee chart.  Thank you, sir.  Just in case you're wondering where the rupee is.  A dollar had been soaring.  Look what happened when we said we're going to keep pumping.  I do.  A rupee.  He's got a rupee in her wallet.  A rupee.  50s.  Look at Gandhi.  One of the first 10 and one's worth 50.  What do you mean?  Gandhi's on the rupee.  Look at that. 
[02:01:30]  Not surprised.  Gandhi?  Yeah.  Is this Gandhi?  Now, no, I can't make any jokes about that.  Reserve Bank of India is marked right on this.  I can't do it.  I was going to say something.  Please don't.  Let's go.  I really can't?  No, you can't.  I don't know.  Are they good at 7-Eleven?  Oh, stop.  All right.  All right.  I won't.  Let's look at the, people may say that all the time.  Right?  Oh, you're nervous.  They do.  They do say that all the time.  They say it all the time.  I've heard that.  It is.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I take it back.  I apologize. 
[02:02:00]  Before I have to.  Anyway, let's look at the, yeah, that's right.  Because of Miss America.  Got all kinds of flack from the tweets.  Yeah.  See, I don't blame anyone in that scenario because that's the world we now live in.  You're scared shitless.  Oh, my God.  So, it's sad.  It shouldn't be that way.  But the guy made, you know, imitating an Indian.  It wasn't even funny.  You couldn't have handled it worse.  Right.  He handled it terribly.  He just made it as awkward as humanly possible.  And he didn't just blurt it out and then go, oh, sorry.  Like, he knew.  He had a chance to think it out and go, should I say this? 
[02:02:30]  Oh, a rupee.  And it wasn't very funny.  But, I mean, they're talking about Indian money.  It's an old hack joke.  He does the Indian accent.  And makes a 7-Eleven joke.  Yeah.  The fact is, every 7-Eleven has an Indian in it.  Yeah, the Simpsons, you know, made a little character there over the years.  Well, it's a cartoon.  We've taught that lesson a long time ago.  You can do it in cartoons.  Yes.  You cannot do it just being a regular person.  No.  Yeah, I don't think that was a big deal either.  Well, that?  Yeah, but you can hear the panic. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, I know.  People know that people do get fired for that shit.  Very frightened.  You cannot do an accent on TV or radio.  Yeah.  In most cases.  If you're white.  Well, yeah.  Right.  You can fuck around if you're not white.  If you're a, yeah.  White people have a very hard time getting away with anything.  But we have it so much better.  But we're privileged.  We're the privileged people.  We know that.  We get away with everything.  Oh, my God.  It's a beautiful way to live.  They just hand out money.  Rules.  Thank God they don't know where the white people money fucking drops are.  Where we just walk up and get stacks of cash for being white. 
[02:03:30]  Was I supposed to mention that?  Oh, shit.  It's not true.  Oh, Chippa.  I'm trying to.  They took you off the list because your mother and Lamar.  Not true.  He's crying.  They're good friends.  Chippa's emotional.  Garbage.  Oh, my God.  Speaking of stupid crying.  Did you see that fucking?  Yes.  Oh, they're trying so hard.  I know exactly what you're going to say.  What?  I think you do.  Right?  No?  Go ahead. 
[02:04:00]  I don't think he does.  I do.  No, I do.  It's a commercial.  Mm-hmm.  Now it'll just go, mm-hmm.  It's a Cheerios commercial.  Yep.  And they're.  Multi-racial.  No, not that one.  Fuck.  They're trying to tug at your heartstrings with a little kid, and he's talking to his mom.  I do believe it's Cheerios.  And what?  Cheerios is going to make everything better?  It's one of those type of commercials? 
[02:04:30]  No.  Okay.  I really don't know, obviously.  And the kid talks about grandma, and the mother gets all choked up.  Oh, I saw that one, because it turns out the grandmother was buying Cheerios when she  was brutally sodomized behind the stop and shop.  That's it.  Did Nana ever give you Cheerios when you were a little kid?  Yeah, she did.  Were Cheerios the same back then?  Cheerios has pretty much been the same forever. 
[02:05:00]  So, when we have Cheerios, it's kind of like we're having breakfast with Nana.  Yuck.  Yeah.  How fucking Cheerios suck is that?  Well, the cereal itself sucks.  Fucking ew.  How pandering.  It's like we're having breakfast with Nana, and then a kid pulls out an urn and puts it 
[02:05:30]  on top.  Sprinkles it over his Cheerios.  Exactly.  To make that shit taste better.  Yeah.  Or they should say, like, we're having breakfast with Nana.  The camera quickly spins around and zombie Nana.  Yeah, right.  Starts eating the kid's face.  Like Norman Bates' mother.  Nana's in a rocking chair.  Kill your child with Cheerios.  Because they're trying so fucking hard there for a moment.  That stunk.  And it's so ham-handed.  It's a weird way to sell cereal.  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  Ham-handed.  And that kid's a douche.  I don't like the fact that he's, like, asking these emotional questions.  Is it the same as when you...  Who cares?  It's a fucking shitty no-sugar cereal.  A kid wouldn't ask that either.  What kid's happy about Cheerios?  They're not.  You want sugar-frosted flakes.  Right.  Here's the deep conversations I used to have with my mom at that age.  When are cartoons on?  Right.  When are the good cartoons?  Because I couldn't distinguish Saturday from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday.  Right.  So I'd be like, is today good cartoons day? 
[02:06:30]  It's funny you bring that up.  Yeah, okay.  Last night I was thinking about this.  My kid, eh, I'm going to watch cartoons now.  And he takes the laptop and figures it all out himself.  And I'm sitting there, I was, like, having a Jimmy moment.  Just, wow, this is amazing.  Instant delivery.  Because I'm thinking, like, you just said, we didn't know when the fuck we could watch cartoons.  No.  We had to wait for it to pop up on TV for a couple hours a day.  Exactly. 
[02:07:00]  Now they can watch whenever the fuck they want.  And know what show he discovered recently?  Huh.  And I forgot all about it until he started watching it?  Felix the Cat.  Wow, that's...  He's all about Felix the Cat on Netflix.  No, it's the old school fucking horribly made...  Felix!  Cartoon.  What was the song?  Get me Felix's magic bag.  The wonderful, wonderful cat.  And then it would know the rest.  Rock bottom.  Whenever he gets in a fix, he reaches into his bag of tricks.  Felix. 
[02:07:30]  That's the cat.  The wonderful, wonderful cat.  You'll laugh so much.  Your sides will ache.  Your heart will go pitter-pat.  Watch and Felix.  See, it's older.  The wonderful cat.  Da-da-da-da-dee.  Boom.  I wish I could push a button and an anvil would fall on the ceiling.  Here it is.  The cat.  The wonderful, wonderful cat.  Whenever he gets in a fix, he reaches into his bag of tricks.  The wonderful, wonderful cat.  You'll laugh so much.  Your sides will make your heart go pitter-pat.  You'll never know where the jokes are coming from.  Watch and Felix.  The wonderful cat. 
[02:08:00]  The wonderful cat.  That was a weird cartoon.  It's from, like, the 50s, yeah.  Dude, he fucking loves it.  Felix.  So weird what they get into.  Who is the bad guy?  What was his name?  Professor.  It's the professor in Rock Bottom.  Yeah.  Felix.  Yeah, that weird voice.  Felix.  Yeah, he was scary.  It's the song.  And speaking of cereal really fast, because, you know, I'm going with that Lucky Charms thing for a little while until people are completely sick of it. 
[02:08:30]  I'm obsessed with Lucky Charms, and I try to say no every day, and I finally failed yesterday for the first time in a week.  Oh.  So, but I started thinking about that.  The reason why I love these over-the-top sugary cereals is because we didn't have them as a kid.  Never had them.  And I tweeted yesterday, our go-to cereal was Wheat Puffs.  Ugh!  Those are terrible!  And then we would find the sugar, finally, and sugar the shit out of it. 
[02:09:00]  So my mom, at that point, should have got, you know-  You'd have to.  Frosted Flakes or something.  Wheat Puffs, worst cereal ever.  Terrible cereal.  Yeah.  We used to get the snack packs, too.  And you'd go through all the good ones real quick, and then you'd be left with Special K.  They always had that shitty one in there.  The shitty ones.  A couple of shitty ones.  It was, um-  Oh, man.  Or regular Corn Flakes, not Frosted Flakes.  Yeah, yeah.  Regular Corn Flakes.  But what did they have in there that was good? 
[02:09:30]  The Frosted Flakes was always in the snack pack.  Yeah.  Rice Krispies?  No, we're talking about the good ones.  I wouldn't do the Rice Krispies either.  They were like three good ones, three bad ones, I think.  Go old school, Sam.  Try to find the snack pack.  No.  I don't think Captain Crunch was ever in the snack pack.  You're talking about those little boxes, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Kellogg's made the snack pack.  Frosted Flakes, Corn Flakes.  Corn Pops was one, yes.  Fruit Loops.  And either Fruit Loops or-  Cocoa Krispies. 
[02:10:00]  Did you just say Apple Jacks?  Apple Jacks is the fucking shit.  Oh my fucking God.  You love it?  I forget.  Yes.  Oh, let's have an Apple Jacks party today.  It's kind of the only Apple Jacks are the only cereal I really eat.  What?  That's the only cereal I'll still eat.  Apple Jacks?  It's Apple Jacks.  They're so good, dude.  They're fucking amazing.  I think we gotta try it for the show.  Yeah, let's get a box of Apple Jacks.  It's not cheating if it's for the show.  That's some Apple Jacks?  We eat what we like.  Fuck Apple Jacks.  Yeah.  Can we get Cinnamon Toast Crunch while we're at it, too?  Get a box of Apple Jacks, a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 
[02:10:30]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch also has French Toast Crunch if you want that.  No.  Stop trying to make a good thing better.  T-Rock, though, he always needs a little extra.  Yeah, I invented it.  He always needs to make everything just a little better.  What happens if we add icing to it?  No, man.  It's good enough.  Just enjoy it as it is.  Sometimes it's just good enough.  You don't need to find the little extra.  They did the icing for shredded wheat.  Has the intern left for our cereal yet?  I doubt it.  We'll send him now. 
[02:11:00]  There's Sal killing it.  Wow, he's fucking nailing it on the phones.  He's doing an amazing job today, Sal.  Woof.  Nailing it on the phones.  We've got to take a break because our guests are going to start showing up.  Oh, shit in a handbag.  We've got Rich Little in minutes, and then we've got Chris Weidman,  who is just a fucking animal in the UFC, obviously,  and from Long Island, which is really cool for us, me and Ann, at least.  And then Michael Shannon from Boardwalk Empire is coming in as well.  You watch it, right, Sam Boardwalk?  And the Iceman.  He's tremendous, this guy.  I have not seen Boardwalk Empire. 
[02:11:30]  It's good.  I can't wait to meet him.  I know.  It's a show I want to see.  I just, I want to watch.  He might be the best actor on the show.  Yeah, he's.  I mean, everybody's really good on that show, but he might be the best.  Yeah, he might be.  I was watching a special on the Iceman, not the movie, but the actual guy last night,  and they were showing pictures of Roy.  DeMeo.  Roy DeMeo.  And I'm looking, I went, oh, my God, it's fucking looks just like Keith.  Yes, I thought the same thing.  Dude, he looks just like Keith.  Same thing.  Absolutely.  It's Keith's uncle. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, I know.  Keith the cop's uncle.  It was Roy DeMeo.  Wow.  And if you pop, pop up, please, you got it, pop up Roy DeMeo's picture.  I was like, because I never, I guess I never really looked at him.  It's like a fucking chubby Keith.  Yes.  Except Roy was a better citizen.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's kind of creepy.  Yeah, fine, like, um.  That's his, that's his uncle, huh?  He, uh, yeah, yeah, that's his father's, uh, brother. 
[02:12:30]  Wow.  Look, look at his face right there.  Wow.  You could totally see Keith.  Absolutely.  I was like, oh, my God.  Wow, that's wild.  That's hilarious.  So Keith should play his uncle.  Right?  We got to take a break, because seriously, Rich Little is on his way up.  The Opie and Anthony Show continues in moments.  Sirius XM.  And now, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Got a legend outside the studio.  Wow. 
[02:13:00]  I've, um, definitely seen this guy.  Rich Little.  Wow.  My God.  Take a seat, sir.  How are you?  God, I just came from makeup.  What a pleasure.  What a pleasure.  You look great.  You look wonderful, sir.  You really do.  You look fantastic.  Almost alive.  Sorry we're running a little late.  We're on the air, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, we just start the show and let her rip, you know?  Right onward, forward, wagons, ho. 
[02:13:30]  That's a gentleman.  Look how he's dressed.  I know.  Well, always.  We could take a, we could learn from this man.  I remember your performances years ago, always dressed, what, in a tux, right?  No, not necessarily.  You always have a tux on, no?  No, that's Dean Martin.  Well, I remember watching those, too.  Dean slept in a tux.  Yeah, always.  You know, in the gutter.  Always very well-dressed.  I see, though, the lapels a little thinner than back in the old days.  Oh, yeah.  They were, I loved those suits. 
[02:14:00]  With those long sideburns and those big collars.  Yes, they were out to your shoulders.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember, my God, years ago, all the great variety shows and specials, and, of  course, on The Tonight Show, the great Rich Little.  How many Tonight Shows did you do?  I was hosting it, I think, about 10 or 12 times.  And that's just hosting it, or those are appearances?  Appearances, probably 20.  Wow. 
[02:14:30]  Wow, yeah.  Johnny treated you well?  I never met Johnny.  No.  He did treat me well, although I didn't get to know him.  I don't think anybody did.  That's what everyone says, yeah.  Yeah, they say, Henry Bushkin has a book that's coming out, his old lawyer, and I'm reading  it now, and Carson seemed like he was a very elusive guy.  Yeah, he was a very private guy, not too talkative off the air, and he was polite, but you didn't  socialize with him.  You never saw him before the show, went to his dressing room or anything like that. 
[02:15:00]  But he drove his own car to NBC every day.  It must have been a shock when he was driving home at night and people looked over.  Right.  That's Johnny Carson.  Must have caused a few accidents.  When years ago, you were on many specials and whatnot, variety shows and stuff, there was  also Frank Gorshin back then, was another impressionist.  So much different than you, though. 
[02:15:30]  Well, yeah, he had a different style.  A totally different style.  Did you feel competitive with him at all?  Well, no, I didn't.  I think he did a little bit, but he came before me.  But Frank, you know, did the routine of announcing who he's going to do, turning around, fixing  his hair.  That was the one, yes, yes.  Getting the face ready and then turning back.  The big reveal.  Me, I just rattle them off. 
[02:16:00]  I would do Howard Cousel.  Then I'd do George Burns.  Then I'd do John Wayne.  Then I'd do Kirk Douglas.  You know?  I mean, I would just go from one to another very quickly.  I've always done that.  And was it something that, from a kid, you just were a little minor bird?  Yeah, I started imitating teachers at school.  So that's how I started.  And I knew I had something going for me because it wasn't long before the teachers were charging 
[02:16:30]  a two-drink minimum and a cover charge.  Now, was it a happy childhood or was this the product of trying to dissociate from something  awful happening?  Well, I was born in Canada.  I'm a Canadian, a Canuck, you know.  So it had to be happy.  Everyone's happy up there.  I came down to the States in 19...  Wow, this dates me.  In 1964, I think, or 63, to do the Judy Garland show.  Oh, wow.  It was my first TV show. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  But I mean, doing the impressions.  When you were a kid, what makes you realize you can do...  Because impressionists are always amazing to me.  Because there has to be such a mindset to just get in and become other people and pick  up on their mannerisms.  Well, you know, people used to introduce me as the world's greatest impressionist.  And I used to say, no, I think the world's greatest impressionist was Van Gogh, Cezanne,  you know, Matisse.  They were good impressionists.  What do you consider yourself?  An impersonator.  Impersonator.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, growing up, you realized you were pretty good at doing this. 
[02:17:30]  How did you make it a career?  Because I started to make money, I thought.  Okay.  This thing, seriously.  Now, how did that happen?  How do you go...  Well, I was...  After I imitated my teachers, which there was no money in that, I started imitating local  politicians and the mayor of Ottawa.  And then I did the prime minister.  And then I started doing some movie stars.  And then organizations would hire me for shows like The Shriners, Knights of Columbus. 
[02:18:00]  And I would go and do 15 minutes, a little stand-up.  And they'd give me $5 or $10.  And I thought that was pretty good being a teenager.  Righteous.  $5 or $10.  Yeah.  Wow.  And then make the big move down to the United States for the Judy Garland show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did that go, that first TV?  Well, Mel Torme got me on the show.  Oh, really?  Mel Torme.  He said, Richie...  The Golden Fog.  The Golden Fog.  Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. 
[02:18:30]  He was great, Mel was.  He was a great movie buff.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He always watched movies in the buff.  Oh, see, I fell for that one.  Home run little.  But, no, we did watch movies.  We did some television together in Toronto.  And we would watch movies all night long.  We'd go down into the basement of the Holiday Inn.  And he'd put up a big bed sheet.  And we'd watch movies all night long.  He was a movie fanatic. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, boy, did he know his movies.  And that's how we became friendly.  And then after we did a TV show in Toronto together, he knew I did all these different voices.  I was doing Lloyd Bridges.  I was doing Raymond Burr.  You know, I was doing a lot of people nobody else did.  And he took a tape of all my voices and played it for Judy Garland.  Wow.  That's pretty nice of him.  And to see if he could get me on the Garland show. 
[02:19:30]  And Judy was not impressed.  Uh-oh.  Really?  However, when I did James Mason, that's when she was impressed because she had done A Star is Born with James Mason.  With James, yeah.  And she loved James Mason.  So when I did my James Mason, of course, when I went into that impression of that voice, I was the one that got my only Judy Garland show.  I remember hearing that one years ago, man, always. 
[02:20:00]  You really sound like James Mason?  Wow.  That's fantastic.  I used to do a speech from A Star is Born.  That was the one I put on the tape.  Of course.  Listen to me, Esther.  A career is a curious thing.  Talent isn't always enough.  You need a sense of timing.  An eye for seeing the turning point and recognizing the big chants when it comes along and grabbing it.  That was the speech I put on the tape.  And that put you over with Judy Garland, yeah.  Daryl Hammond is a great impressionist, too, impersonator. 
[02:20:30]  Yes, he is.  And Daryl said something weird.  He sees voices.  And that was a psychopath.  But he sees things in color, he said.  There's a weird way he sees voices.  What does he do?  He's doing crayons?  I don't know.  He has a bit of a history of smoking crack, so that could have been it.  But he would give us a color.  We go, you know, when you're doing Clinton, what color?  And he said, like, orange.  Yeah, he sees it.  And he knew.  Weirdly.  How do you see a voice?  Clinton is probably the easiest impression for anybody to do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know that, Bill Clinton?  Even Bono did it. 
[02:21:00]  Because all you got to do is put a frog in your throat.  Yeah.  Kermit the frog, probably.  But, you know, Bill Clinton is just, you know, that kind of static in his voice.  Yeah, yeah.  You're kind of a little gritty in the back of your throat.  Can you see Bill Clinton going, I think I'll clear my throat just a second.  There, that's much better.  Bono was on the news this morning from U2 showing, doing his impression of Clinton.  I guess they had gotten together for some meeting and Clinton was late to the meeting. 
[02:21:30]  So Bono just started doing this spot-on impression of Bill Clinton.  So I guess you're right.  Everybody can do a Bill Clinton impression.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is there anyone you couldn't do that you wanted to do?  Is there one that you could just never get?  I would like to do Anjali Jolet.  I would like to do her.  I'd never be lonely.  Oh, there's a lot of people I can't do.  You know, they say rich little man of a thousand voices, which is kind of corny.  It's really, you know, Long Cheney was man of a thousand faces. 
[02:22:00]  And then they said, man, I have a thousand voices.  I don't do a thousand voices.  I do about 200.  Which was one that you worked on and worked on and worked on and just felt like, ah, I  got to let it go.  Was there one that you just...  Oh, yeah.  Which one?  There were many.  Oh, let's see, Mike Douglas, when I was on the Mike Douglas show years ago, I could never  get him down.  There were voices that other people did so well that I just lost interest. 
[02:22:30]  Frank Gorshin did Kurt Douglas and Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark.  I never able to do him.  A lot of the older stars, you know.  The older stars are better to do because they were larger than life and they were identifiable.  Yeah, yeah.  You do George Clooney.  If I did a spot on impression of George Clooney, which I can't do, I don't think it would get  any reaction at all.  Right.  There was this over the top dramatic delivery with a lot of the older actors that you could 
[02:23:00]  really kind of fix on and play it that way.  Yeah.  Did you ever notice it was easy or easier if you had heard someone do an impression of  somebody?  Oh, yeah.  And then pick up on that?  Oh, yeah.  I had noticed that over the years.  If you try to do an impression of somebody and you can't quite get it and then you hear  someone else do it, you go, oh.  That's right.  So now you can find that little niche to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can steal a voice from somebody else. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you were right at the forefront when Richard Nixon was in office and you were the guy  at that point to do Nixon impressions.  David Fry was, too.  Yeah, but he was more of the look like.  And caricature.  Yeah, caricature.  Yeah, I tried to do him more realistically and not make him a cartoon.  I once did Nixon in front of him.  Yeah, yeah.  How did that go?  I was invited to a garden party at San Clemente. 
[02:24:00]  I was in my early 20s.  The Western Lighthouse.  And there were a lot of celebrities there.  And when I arrived, I thought, gosh, my act is here.  And I've never met my act before.  John Wayne was there and George Burns, Jack Benny, Glenn Ford, Glenn Campbell, you name  it.  They were all there.  And Debbie Reynolds, oh, I've never forgiven her for this.  She grabbed my hand, pulled me around the swimming pool, threw me to the back of Richard 
[02:24:30]  Nixon and yelled out, Mr. President, Rich Little is going to do you.  He thought I was going to shoot him.  And he turned around in total fear and looked at me.  And I went into my impression of Richard Nixon.  And he didn't know who I was doing.  Oh, no.  I was going, Mr. Preston, let me make this perfectly clear.  I am delighted to be here today.  And he looked at me, and then he turned to his wife, Pat, and he said, why is this young 
[02:25:00]  man speaking in this strange room?  He did not know I was doing him.  The whole time I was doing him.  And, oh, the celebrities were gagging.  Did you just, were you sweating?  Oh, I was sweating.  George Burns came up to me later and said, I was so nervous, I ate a flower.  And John Wayne said, somebody get a rope.  You know.  But I did a good impression of Nixon, though. 
[02:25:30]  Yes.  Because when I left that party, Pat, his wife, went with me.  I couldn't get rid of her for two weeks.  Wow.  So you basically, your impression of Nixon, you bombed at two Nixon doing Nixon.  In front of a bunch of celebrities.  Well, Nixon had no sense of humor.  Apparently.  Yeah.  The takes kind of revealed that.  A man who wore the same blue suit for over 40 years and never took the hanger out of it.  How funny can he be? 
[02:26:00]  That's a great comedian's horror story.  Just doing the voice to the president and not, how did Reagan like your impression?  Oh, Reagan was much different.  Reagan just was hysterical.  I mean, I kept pinching myself.  I'm talking to the president of the United States and he's telling me jokes.  He's doing impressions for me.  Yeah, he was apparently a real hoot.  You know.  Oh, he just loved humor.  His sense of humor is legendary.  I remember he did his Jimmy Stewart for me. 
[02:26:30]  You know, which was the standard Jimmy Stewart.  Wah, wah, wah.  And then he did John Wayne.  And that was okay.  But then he did Truman Capote for me.  Wow.  In the Lincoln Room one night after a state dinner.  He went into his Truman Capote.  Go on.  Reagan did.  And he sounded a little like Truman Capote like this, you see.  And I thought it was pretty good.  And then he said, Rich, I don't have a line. 
[02:27:00]  I don't know what to say as Truman Capote.  Have you got a good joke I could use?  And I said, as a matter of fact, I do.  Well, I would appreciate that if you would give me that because I don't know what to say when I do my Truman.  So I gave him this joke and he got a Secret Service man, wrote it on his back, the whole joke out.  And the joke was this.  I said, this is Truman Capote. 
[02:27:30]  You know, a lot of people think that I wrote in cold blood, but that's not true.  No, actually, I wrote in ink.  I wrote in cold blood, you know, and Gorbachev going. 
[02:28:00]  That is not true.  I would have been in it.  Don't you?  You know.  He starts doing his act.  Well, the next thing you know, the wall came down because he just thought Reagan was out of his mind.  He's like, drop the wall.  He's going to kill us all.  So maybe you helped.  Yeah.  One time when I went to the White House for a little tea they were having and I was late and I was kicking myself. 
[02:28:30]  You rock.  And I ran down the hall of the White House to the Lincoln Room.  And there was Reagan out in front talking to the press.  And he looked up and he said, Rich, thank God you're here.  I'm starved and I'm stuck with these press people.  And he said, you do me better than I do.  You finish this press conference.  I said, what?  You finish this press conference.  I'm going for a cucumber sandwich. 
[02:29:00]  And he left.  And he left me with the press.  And I went into my Reagan.  Wow.  And they were asking me questions.  It was the time of the Grenada thing.  And they said, Mr. President, what do you think of Grenada?  Well, I think it's the best song that Buddy Greco ever recorded.  You know, and then they were asking me other things and I was answering as Reagan.  And he was peeking around the corner.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And listening to me and just laughing his head off.  Yeah, he apparently really did.  They were asking me questions, you know, things like, what are you going to do for the little guy in America? 
[02:29:30]  And I'd say, well, get him a little woman, you know, I mean, silly, stupid answers.  Do you see how the world has changed now and you couldn't do that now without the press throwing you under the bus?  Oh, yeah.  It's just everything has just gotten.  You couldn't do that today.  No, no, no.  You wouldn't even get close to the president.  What do you not like about the business now, about show business now?  Because you've seen quite an arc.  Well, yeah, I think it's certainly a lot bluer than it is. 
[02:30:00]  I mean, a lot of the young comics today want the shock value.  Oh, yeah.  So they use four-letter words when they don't have to, you know.  I mean, all those Dean Martin celebrity roasts, they took shots of people, but they were never blue, you know.  You know, the ones today are really vicious.  The language is unbelievable, you know. 
[02:30:30]  It's like doing a fryer's roast.  I've done some of those in the past, too.  Those fryer's roasts were blue, but they were clever, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were clever.  Yeah.  I loved watching those Dean Martin roasts.  Yeah, the Dean Martin celebrity roasts are out now.  Is that what you're promoting?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm going around the country promoting the Dean Martin celebrity roasts because I'm probably the only person still living.  So I was only 12 when I did them, but they're out on DVD, and I think they're going to be a big seller because people tell me all the time, you know. 
[02:31:00]  When there's nothing on TV, we always get out an old Dean Martin roast and watch it.  Now they're on DVD.  12 complete roasts, six DVDs with three hours of extras.  Who are some of the celebrities being roasted?  And the roasted people on this CD, you know, they did 54 roasts. 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  50 over about six years.  But this is Johnny Carson, Lucille Ball, Don Rickles, Jimmy Stewart, Bob Hope.  Yeah.  And a few others.  I remember the Lucille Ball one was hilarious.  Oh, my God.  I thought the best one was either Johnny Carson or Jimmy Stewart.  How many of those were you a part of?  Well, I did 52 roasts.  Yeah.  I was in my 20s. 
[02:32:00]  I was terrified.  Really?  I mean, if you stand up in front of the likes of, you look on your right and you see George Burns, Jack Benny, Lucille Ball, Orson Welles, you know.  And then you see Don Rickles, and then you see Dean Martin, you see Frank Sinatra, John Wayne.  I mean, it's enough to.  You're the kid there.  It's enough to make you just keel over, you know, from sheer terror.  Did you do poorly on any of them that you look back on?  You're like, oh, I kind of wish I could take that one out of the.  Yeah, there's a couple. 
[02:32:30]  I thought, oh, I can do that better today.  You know, but there are some that surprised me, like the Jimmy Stewart one was great fun to do because I showed Jimmy how to do himself.  And we winged it.  We didn't script it.  Right.  Yeah.  I said, Jim, all you got to do is just stick out your hand like this and bend over and say, wow, just like that. 
[02:33:00]  And Jim stuck out his hand and bent over and went, wow.  Oh, I said, that sounds like a seal in heat for heaven's sake.  That is the worst Jimmy Stewart I've ever heard.  Sit down.  That's terrible.  And it was a very funny one.  That's funny.  And he went with it.  You went with it.  Did you did you you did laugh in a few times?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How was that behind the scenes?  It always you always think there was a lot of chaos, perhaps some illegalities going on. 
[02:33:30]  But yeah, yeah, a party, a party going on back there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody was very friendly.  And the thing about laughing is, is that it was quick.  You know, they did such short little sketches and everybody did it.  Nixon was on it.  Yeah.  John Wayne was on one show I did where he played a rabbit.  They had him dressed up in a bunny costume.  It does seem that they were able to get people to do things they would never do anywhere else. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a popular show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wasn't allowed to watch it, but I would sneak out of my room and kind of peek out of the bedroom door and watch it until my father saw that we were peeking.  And then, well, you know, back then I probably got a swat.  Yeah.  So, like Pavlov's dog, I watch it now and I wince in pain.  Are you still doing it?  The next date Rich has, by the way, for a show is it's called Jimmy Stewart and Friends starring you. 
[02:34:30]  And it's November the 10th in Sydney, Ohio.  So if you're out there, I'm guessing tickets are available now.  It's in the Sydney High School Auditorium.  Wow.  And is that where they got me going?  Sydney, Ohio.  You don't like Mr. Little, do you?  No, it's on the prep sheet.  I was going to promote.  That's hilarious.  It was so cold.  It was so cold in Sydney, Ohio this morning. 
[02:35:00]  How cold was it?  An exhibitionist came up to me and had to describe himself to me.  No, that would be fun.  That would be fun.  That would be fun.  I just finished doing the Andy Williams Theater in Branson, Missouri.  Oh, okay.  That was great fun.  Yeah.  Great fun.  Beautiful theater.  Are you still out a lot doing a lot of dates?  Yeah.  Well, I've been doing this show on Jimmy Stewart and Friends. 
[02:35:30]  Okay.  For the last four years.  And really, it looks like we're going to bring it to Broadway next year.  Oh, wow.  I didn't say we play it, but we're going to bring it.  Just bring it.  Just bring it and leave it here.  Well, richlittle.com is the website for the dates.  If you want anything you want to know about Rich or his, and he's promoting the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast Collection, which is out now.  Six DVDs.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  And the great Rich Little.  Rich, thanks so much for coming in.  What a great time.  Good to see you.  Great time.  Come back and see us. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  I'm sorry I put makeup on for this show.  Exactly.  And when we talked about the Dean Martin Rose, I held up the DVD.  You did hold it up.  I do like that you held it up.  Yeah.  I held it up so you could hear it.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Rich Little.  Thanks, everyone.  After these messages, the O.P. and Anthony Show will be right back.  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Ah, Chris. 
[02:36:30]  What's up?  What's going on, man?  How you doing?  How you doing, man?  How you doing?  Good.  What's up, Chris?  What part of Long Island?  I need to know right off the bat.  Baldwin.  Baldwin.  Oh, yeah.  Huntington.  Okay.  Yeah, I just actually bought a house in Dix Hills.  We're closing.  Ooh.  What happened?  We're closing.  Dix Hills.  Dix Hills, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Next to Huntington.  Yeah.  I'm closing on a house. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, you're closing on a house in Dix Hills.  Closing on a house, yeah.  Coming on up.  Can't wait.  Congrats, man.  That's pretty good.  Leaving the South Shore for the first time in my life.  Oh, man.  That's a whole nother world.  A little scary.  North Shore, South Shore.  It's really two different worlds.  North Shore, South Shore, Long Island with the LIE splitting.  Yeah.  I was East Northport for quite a while.  It was always weird to go south of the Long Island Expressway.  Oh, these people.  Right.  Well, and then growing up, there was always fucking, you know, the Bayshore hair chicks  and stuff. 
[02:37:30]  Bayshore.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  All that shit.  He might be a little too young for that, actually.  Yeah.  You don't remember the waterfall hairdo, right?  The bangs.  The waterfall bangs.  Nah, see, he's too young.  Chicks would, like, spray their hair, brush it all forward because they wanted that big  presentation like a lion mane, and then they turned sideways, and it was just, like, empty  in the back.  We called it the waterfall.  What was that?  The 80s?  70s?  Yeah, it was probably the 80s.  80s.  Yeah.  I remember.  I got you.  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Wow.  From Baldwin, though.  That is South Shore.  We obviously were rooting for you just because we're Long Island guys.  I appreciate it.  Now that we know more about you, holy shit.  Yeah.  Congrats on everything.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, absolutely.  I turned around.  I was actually at the fight, and I was in Vegas for that, and I was rooting for Silva,  and halfway through the fight, I got so annoyed at Silva.  I got so annoyed at Silva, I started yelling in favor of Wyman.  I got so annoyed at the way he was acting, I wanted to see you beat him. 
[02:38:30]  Certainly did.  Yeah, but, I mean, really, I'm a fan of his.  So you're from New York?  Yeah, yeah, Jersey.  And you were rooting against me?  Not necessarily against you as much as I was rooting for.  No, just stick with it, man.  No, no, but I wasn't against you.  It was, you know.  That's all right.  No, I appreciate it.  But I wound up really.  Actually, he's more Jersey than New York, so.  You know what's crazy?  Everywhere I go, everybody's confused in New York and Jersey.  It pisses me off.  Oh, man.  I'm from New York, and I'm not from Jersey.  New York.  I grew up in Jersey, and I live in the, I like to call it the Big Apple, because that makes  me sound like I grew up here. 
[02:39:00]  Typical Jersey guy.  But in the middle of that fight, it seemed like in the fucking first round, and a lot  of the fighters had you picked, like Chael and Uriah Faber.  In the first round, you got Anderson Silva down, and you had him in a, it looked almost  like a, what is it, a heel hook you were going for?  Yeah, heel hook and knee bar, I had him out, two variations of that, yeah.  And I think that really frightened him.  Yeah, no, I felt like I had the advantage on the floor, and it's one of those things,  it was a high-risk move to, you know, to go for it, there was a good chance to get back  to his feet, but I felt there was an opportunity to go for it. 
[02:39:30]  I hit him with a big shot on the ground, and I felt he went out for a second.  Oh, wow.  So I attacked the submission, and when I attacked it, he ended up slipping out, got back to  our feet, but I was confident there, too, so it was all good.  But then he started, then Silva started the taunting, and that's what made me think,  like, wow, this, Chris really scared him, because now he's going into the psychological.  The taunting was more than usual, because we all know he likes to fool around.  Well, there's been, there's been some fights he's had where it was a lot worse than that,  though.  You think?  Yeah, terrible.  Damian Maia was bad.  There was two fights. 
[02:40:00]  Okay.  When he fought Damian Maia and Talieslades, it was like, I mean, and he didn't even finish  those fights.  He was toying with them, toying with them, and didn't finish them.  It was the most embarrassing fights you could ever see.  Yeah, if you're going to do that, you better knock them out and finish it out.  Yeah, if you could do all that, you'd think you'd just be like, all right, you could hit  them out of nowhere and knock them out anytime you want.  Yeah.  So what was happening?  When that started to happen, what was going through your head?  Stay calm, you know, keep moving forward.  I had guys I brought in that would do all that type of stuff to me, you know, boxers, kick 
[02:40:30]  boxers.  They start trying to mess with me, talk to me, because we knew he was going to be doing  that.  So just stay focused on what I got to do.  But it got to the point when, in that second round, you know, I always kind of imagined  if he was going to start doing that, it was going to be if he was picking me apart on my  feet, and I was losing, and he's trying to embarrass me, and I figured I'd be able to  keep my emotions steady when that was happening.  I didn't expect for him to be doing it when I'm picking him apart.  I'm just like, then it just pissed me off.  Like, who the hell are you thinking of him?  And I was like, I am not, it got to the point when he started fooling around for like, after 
[02:41:00]  I hit him with like a left hook that didn't definitely, definitely didn't like stun him  really, but he pretended like he did.  And I was like, you mother.  And I just went after him.  I just, you know, I threw everything I had at him.  I wasn't going to stop throwing until I hit him.  And I, you know, I ended up hitting that left hook.  So, so you're, you're saying that when you did, you, you, you hit him and, uh, he looked  like he was going to go down that wobble.  I doubt maybe it hit him decent and he felt like a, and then he plays it up, making me  think he didn't really get hurt.  Uh-huh.  You know, just trying to mess with me. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Like you can't hurt me.  Took something out of him though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And.  Oh man.  Made him not think straight, I guess.  Yeah.  Didn't work out for him.  Oh, did he fucking go down.  I've never been more shocked at a sporting event than watching him fall.  I couldn't believe it.  Because, because again, you're so used to seeing him at least you knocked him the fuck  out.  I couldn't believe he knocked him out.  And what was going through your mind as he's, he's falling off?  Yeah.  As you felt your fist hit that face.  What was going through your mind?  It's hard to put into words, but at the time it just kind of finished his fight. 
[02:42:00]  Like, all right.  And what that left hook, I got to keep hitting him.  I don't know if he's going to gain consciousness or whatever, but.  But you had to have a holy shit moment.  Like, oh, I mean, when I, when I, when I freaking knocked him out, I got back to my feet.  I was like, what?  I actually started, they actually took the camera away.  But if you'll see when I'm putting my, when they put the belt around me, my shorts, the  Velcro is all ripped open.  That's not easy to do.  I literally started ripping my shorts off.  I was stripping down.  I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.  So thank God.  That's a Long Island thing, man. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, yeah, take my pants off.  That's, usually you see that outside bars, but that is really a Long Island thing.  That's crazy.  It was crazy.  It was a surreal feeling.  Yeah.  I imagine, you know, freaking beating him a million times to do it.  And the way it happened was just, you know, obviously crazy.  Well, we're all in now with you, man.  Jimmy, you're all in, right?  Yeah.  I still love Silva, but I really, really like you too, because that was amazing.  I was so pissed off at him for doing that.  It was like, this is the number one contender.  You can't, what are you doing to this?  Right.  You can't fucking do that to this guy who just put you on your ass in the first round. 
[02:43:00]  It just, it really irritated me.  And I felt it was for the wrong reasons.  It was like, you're just trying to psych him out.  And I was yelling to you, don't fall for it.  I'm sure you didn't hear me, but I was so, but I really was irritated.  I'm like, don't fucking fall for that nonsense.  So you really started cheering for me?  I'm not bullshitting you.  No, no, I wouldn't lie to you.  No, I have no problem saying I was a Silva fan because I like him.  And we had interviewed him before and he was very nice, but I got so aggravated.  I started rooting for you to beat him.  And I was shocked that it happened, but I was really glad that it did when it did.  It was just unnecessary. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  It was unnecessary when a guy puts you down to stand up and start dropping your arms.  It's like, you know.  Yeah, I agree.  How did you get past the mystique of this is Anderson Silva?  Like, how did you, or did you never fall for it or did you fall for it and then get beyond it?  It's always a struggle.  You know, anytime you fight anybody, you see everyone at this stage of the game is good.  There's things about them that are, you know, almost mesmerizing.  You know, you can look at them and be like, oh, wow.  But you have to just realize, you know, they're a human being.  You know, they put their pants on just like you. 
[02:44:00]  And that's really it.  In the second round, when he started kicking you, he seemed like he was throwing some, like he was striking a little bit better.  It seemed like in the second round.  And his kicks, there's almost an arrogance when he throws a kick.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  The face he makes when he throws a kick, like it's a disdainful thing.  And he seemed like he was, he started connecting.  Yeah, he, that was one thing that we probably, I didn't expect.  I didn't expect him to throw low kicks at all or to the leg kicks just because I thought he'd be a little bit more worried about the wrestling. 
[02:44:30]  So during the camp, I didn't get leg kicked at all because the guy who usually leg kicks me had a messed up shit in the whole camp.  So I didn't, and the kickboxes we brought in were more guys who like flashy type kickboxing because that's what he does.  And Anderson's really not known for his leg kicks.  And especially fighting a guy like me as a wrestler, I would think that he was going to stay away from that.  So when he started leg kicking me, I'm like, in my head, I'm like, all right, next time you do it, I'm taking you down.  But it just wasn't second nature at that time.  I just didn't do it for, so I wasn't taking guys down off leg kicks for a while.  Now, why is it bad to throw a leg kick at a wrestler? 
[02:45:00]  Because it's easier to get taken down.  Just think, you know, I could just grab your leg and push you over and you're down.  It really is.  Like, could a small guy like, it's always amazing to me the way, how fast you can put somebody down.  It's almost like fighting has changed.  You can bring down somebody of anybody, of any size, really, by grabbing their leg.  So, yeah, I mean, it depends how big this guy is and if he knows what he's doing, too.  But are you asking if I can?  Yeah, or any UFC guy.  I would say we can.  Or more of you, Ken. 
[02:45:30]  Not necessarily.  That's where I thought you were going with that.  No, no, no.  Let's say a gentleman of my size, of a slider frame.  But if I happen to be trained in fighting.  Yeah, I think you get somebody's leg up in the air and you kind of know what you're doing a little bit.  Yeah, it's going to be hard to, especially in the heat of a battle,  when you throw a kick and you're able to catch his leg and just run him over,  I mean, it's hard to really stop.  Whether the guy's a great wrestler or not, it's just too big of an advantage.  And you went to Hofstra University.  Went to Hofstra University. 
[02:46:00]  I say that because you got a degree in psychology.  Does that help you out in the sport at all?  Yeah, I think so.  In one way?  I just know the right type of mindset you need to be a winner.  I kind of studied that stuff and realized there's a million different doubts that come to your mind.  It's just part of human nature.  You have to be able to work through that and keep the positives over the negatives and just stay confident.  I mean, it's all about confidence, man.  And you're not always going to feel confident. 
[02:46:30]  But all that matters is when you step in that cage, when you touch those gloves, that you're confident.  And I think that all literally comes from hard work.  If you're not working hard every day, you're not going to feel like you really belong in there and you even deserve to win.  So that's really where it's at.  What's the scariest moment when you first step in?  Because I always watch guys right before the announcement or when the other fighter comes in and is doing that little circle around the ring.  Or when they're ready to announce you.  What is the moment where you're like, fuck?  Is there any moment where it's the most jarring? 
[02:47:00]  I don't get crazy nervous, man.  I've been competing for such a long time.  I do a good job at just putting it out of my mind.  I give up to God and just say a prayer.  And at that point, I just feel really relaxed.  But I'd say probably the most like, oh, here we go.  This is like all this hard work is about to pay off.  The guy, Burt Watson, he's the guy who gets us out of the dressing room and tells us he's ready to go.  And he's out of his mind.  Great guy.  And when he starts saying it's time to roll and you and your team have to come and start getting ready to walk out and you're going to sit and wait for your walkout song to come out. 
[02:47:30]  Come on.  That's probably the time.  It's like, here we go.  It's time.  That's got to be a great feeling, though.  Hearing your song and then you get to walk in.  When this song comes on, man, it's like, it's crazy, man.  Everybody's going crazy.  It's a pretty cool feeling.  What is your song?  Won't Back Down, Tom Petty.  Nice.  It's a good one.  How did you choose that? 
[02:48:00]  Nice.  Would you like work out in the gym and go, I'm going to walk out to that someday?  Actually, I'm not a big music guy.  And one of my friends a couple of fights ago was like, oh, he's just, you know, actually, I think I did like a little Facebook thing.  I said, you know, pick my next walkout song.  And there's a bunch of songs.  And I think I just clicked this.  And I was like, wow, I think I like that one.  And I've done it for the last couple of fights.  I think I'm going to do it again.  Everybody loves it.  I got a lot of people who love it.  Yeah, I don't remember the song.  I didn't know it.  Oh, you know it.  Yeah, you'll know it.  Can we play it?  Yeah, where is it? 
[02:48:30]  I can't sing it.  I can't remember anything.  Oh, no.  There's no one at the board.  E-Rock.  You play that, E-Rock?  E.  Spotify.  E-Rock.  Could you play it?  Tom Petty.  Hang on.  Who just told you?  Walked back down.  No.  He wasn't there.  He wasn't there.  He just, like, came from the ground.  On the ground.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Sleeping on the ground.  I love it.  It's just...  Your whole job is to wait.  It's just...  Your whole job is just to wait.  I know it sucks.  And he still hears right now? 
[02:49:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  You know, they do, like, big ears.  Chris likes it.  See, that's the Long Island humor right there.  Oh, yeah.  I feel like he could relate to you just because you're from Long Island.  Everybody give him a round of applause.  Yeah.  You know this song, right?  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Yes.  It'd be great if he just started beating the shit out of you.  Yeah, it'd be great for you, too.  I do get pissed when I hear this song.  You do?  Now, does it motivate you walking out?  Because if other people picked it for you, since you're not a big music guy, but does it 
[02:49:30]  motivate you at all?  No, it motivates you.  I feel like this is my song now.  Yeah, so it motivates me.  It makes me feel relaxed and just, like, ready to go.  You know, I just feel good.  Really?  And, of course, don't back down.  Yeah.  Don't back down.  I'm going forward.  I won't back down.  I won't stand my ground.  What's the worst walk-on song you've heard anybody use?  I'm a little teapot.  Are you kidding?  I would be hilarious.  At a smaller show.  I want to do that.  You know?  Just get people's reactions. 
[02:50:00]  Everyone's got, like, mama's going to knock you out.  Right, right, right.  And this kid comes out with, I'm a little teapot.  Oh, man.  The place must have went nuts.  Yeah, that's great.  Then he gets knocked out in the first round.  Oh, that would be embarrassing.  Yeah, you better know how to fucking...  He wasn't good.  We should mention, Chris has a huge event today.  Yes.  You're going to be at John's Gym, right?  John Street.  John Street?  Yeah.  UFC Gym on John Street.  John Street here in New York.  Isn't there a John Street Gym, too, or something?  I don't know.  Okay.  I don't want to confuse everybody.  But fans will be able to meet Weidman and Silva today, September 25th, at 5 p.m. 
[02:50:30]  At the UFC Gym on John Street in New York City.  And that's a tremendous thing, is that both of these guys are going to be there.  Only the first 300 people in line are guaranteed autographs.  That means there's going to be a lot of people.  So get there early, so you don't have to bitch that you didn't get in.  Oh, we don't even have to promote.  It's going to be ridiculous down there.  Do you guys get along?  Yeah, we shake hands.  We're not friends or anything like that.  You know, we've been...  Is there a reason why you...  I was with him in L.A.  I'm with him in Las Vegas.  We're doing this whole world tour thing.  Right.  Is that what we're going to ask?  No, go ahead. 
[02:51:00]  Oh.  No, I want to know why you're not friends.  It's just...  I mean, we're going to end up fighting each other.  I mean, he has his friends that he's with when we're walking around.  I have my group that we're hanging out with, so I'm not going to go over and start talking  to him about his family and stuff like that.  Right, right.  So it's really just...  It's business.  You know, we shake hands, laugh, respect each other, but that's really it.  What did you think...  Like, what did you do that night?  Like, after you won?  Because you weren't hurt.  It wasn't like you had to go to the hospital.  I mean, you seemed like you were in perfect condition.  What did you do after that?  Like, after you leave the arena, you shower, like, what happens? 
[02:51:30]  Uh, just try not...  I mean, try to get back to the hotel and get to the after parties as fast as possible.  All right.  Yeah, that's really...  You know, we had the press conference.  You had to wait for that.  You got a million interviews you got to do.  And then as soon as that's over, just try to get to that hotel room as fast as you can  and get dressed to go out.  Because we had two after parties.  I had to...  I was actually, like, assigned to go to two after parties, getting paid appearance.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  We got to get out of here.  Let's go.  Well, because you didn't have a lot of money, right?  Not really.  You were in a tough spot before.  I would not say I had a lot of money at all, yeah, so... 
[02:52:00]  Some say you were close to bankruptcy.  Yeah, I don't know about bankruptcy.  What is that, when your business closed down?  I don't...  Yeah, no, but I was actually one of my coaches who said that, so that was a little far-fetched.  Okay.  That was a little far-fetched, but I wasn't bankrupt.  You know, I got hit by Hurricane Sandy.  My house got completely ruined.  I had to move into my parents' house, which is in Baldwin, but more north, so it didn't  get affected like my house did.  And, you know, it was tough times, but I was...  Listen, there was a lot of people a lot worse off than me.  Right.  I was all right.  Hence, moving to Dix Hills, huh?  Moving to Dix Hills after this last fight. 
[02:52:30]  We made that happen fast.  Get away from the beaches, man.  Yes.  Yeah, my wife, no matter what, she was like, we're not anywhere close to the water.  I'm like, come on.  Yeah.  Like this...  I'm a South Shore guy.  It's hard for me to leave the South Shore.  Right.  But anywhere on the South Shore, if you get nice houses, it's usually closer to the water.  Yeah.  And I didn't want to...  And by all the canals and everything, you're done.  She got a good deal down there, though.  Because everyone's scared.  Because everyone's scared shitless.  Because the house I have, no one wants now. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Yeah, like a hundred grand, you know.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone got fucked down there, man.  Yeah, it's bad.  How much is insurance on this place?  That's got to be...  Well, they don't even insure...  It goes through FEMA.  Oh, for flood insurance, you're talking about how much is flood insurance?  I can't even tell you.  You can't get it or you can?  Well, you can't go through private...  It's got to go through FEMA.  You can't just go to fucking Affleck and go, hey, I want flood insurance for me.  Why not?  They're a little scared.  Because they're in the flood zone.  Now it's no joke.  Yeah.  They don't fuck around with that.  And now the flood zone's a lot bigger.  Yeah, yeah.  They push the levels back further north. 
[02:53:30]  So the insurance companies won't cover it?  Nope.  What good is flood insurance if you don't live where it floods?  Well, that's just it, Bill.  I bet they love Arizona through their main offices.  They'll give you...  On the lake in Arizona.  That's the beauty of it.  Killing them out there.  That's the beauty of insurance companies, of course.  They never want to pay off.  No, they don't want to pay.  They don't want you paying in.  They don't want...  Yeah, exactly.  You can get flood insurance in areas that don't flood.  Right.  And I guess if there's a complete fluke or you bust a pipe or something like that. 
[02:54:00]  But as far as hurricanes go and storms, fuck you.  They don't want to do it.  Like in Florida, it has to be hard to get flood insurance too.  Yeah.  Again, anywhere you're in a hurricane zone or anything, FEMA, federal.  Buy the house.  You own it and you're screwed.  It is a risk, man.  You know?  You live in large on the beach, but every so often you're like...  It's not what it used to be, man.  I was on the canal, but...  Yeah.  What happened?  But the house, you know, a couple years ago, it's just not... 
[02:54:30]  I mean, first of all, I never really used it on...  I never really used the canal at all.  Oh, you didn't?  It just wasn't worth it, but...  Oh, man, you didn't grab a boat or something?  Did you grab a boat, man?  I was just so busy and I didn't have that much money to even get one.  So now I'm leaving it and I'm like, oh, man.  I could have gotten a fucking boat.  Could have done some new things.  Should have moved to North Port.  Oh, God.  Did you hear Iraq whisper in our ear?  You heard that, right?  Who was that?  That was him.  I didn't hear him.  He didn't get us all new.  I have no connection to him.  Wait, that's the Tom Petty guy?  Yeah.  You heard his voice, right?  Yeah.  You distracted me after you couldn't get my song on instantly? 
[02:55:00]  Oh, man.  This is terrible.  And he doesn't even know Iraq.  Ha, ha, Iraq.  Can't blame us for that.  What will you say?  I know you said, Michael, who has to go?  Chris?  Chris has another interview right after that.  Oh, you're kicking me out.  I'm going to kick that out.  No, no, no.  That's your guys telling us.  Oh, no.  Iraq is kicking me out.  Iraq.  Well, I guess we should give the plug properly.  Absolutely.  He'll tell us when, because that's your guys let him know.  And, of course, UFC 168.  Yeah, in Vegas.  Oh, my God.  When is that?  December 28th.  28th.  28th.  Okay.  Did you want it to be right still with the next fight you had? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  It was the first thing I said in the cage after I knocked him out, after I cursed a little bit  and got mad that he was torn on me.  And then I went up to him and I was like, we got to have a rematch.  We got to have a rematch.  I wanted a rematch.  I knew he was going to get a rematch anyway.  That's before I even got into that cage.  I knew if I was to beat him, we're going to fight again.  I wanted to do that.  Nice.  Is it a mandatory thing?  It wasn't.  It's not mandatory.  Nope.  Not in contract or anything like that, but just one of those things that he was the greatest  of all time.  You know, known as one of the best ever for such a long time. 
[02:56:00]  You know, so he deserves a rematch.  Oh, that's a good way to think of it.  And you recently said that you think it's going to be easier, the rematch.  I don't know.  I'm expecting a war.  You know, I have a lot of, I think he's going to be, I think he's a stud, obviously.  But I'm going to feel better in this fight than I did in my last.  This last fight, I had a year layoff.  I had two surgeries.  I had Hurricane Sandy.  This time, I got everything going my way.  You know, I feel great.  I'm able to get better right now. 
[02:56:30]  This time, I was still rehabbing an injury and having no money.  So this, I just, there's a lot of things going in my order, going for me right now where  I'm going to feel a lot better in this fight.  Cool, man.  Hey, thanks for coming in.  Absolutely.  Should we get a move?  Thank you.  What a pisser.  Should I get something?  Oh, oh, oh.  I normally do.  We got to do it fast.  Michael Shannon's outside.  Oh, is he outside?  Okay.  Well, I normally have the fighters.  They usually put me in a move or something like that.  I've had, everyone's done it.  Anderson's kicked me.  Fedor's choked me.  I've had a lot. 
[02:57:00]  But we have to do, uh.  It's like a two second thing.  Yeah, just, I believe you, I tap immediately.  Or, what do you want me to, on the mic?  Like, you gotta, like, gargle into the mic or something?  Oh, he was like.  I don't want to necessarily gargle.  He got fucked up so bad.  It was great.  Basically, what kind of moves can you do on Jimmy?  I could just put my hand across his throat and just squeeze.  Um, no, that would be unpleasant.  No, that would be unpleasant.  Hang on, I'll take my headset, though.  Okay.  You want, um.  No, but I'll tap.  I've gotten a lot of, you know, a lot of.  Got the guillotine.  Got the reneka choke.  Somewhere the arm might bend back.  Yeah, but let me, where I can tap, too. 
[02:57:30]  Stay within tapping.  Now, just tell, hold on, just tell them what you're doing before you.  I'm pushing a police move.  This is a little bit of a camora.  He's got my, um, my, my arm is behind my, behind my, uh, hold on, I'm gonna make sure  I, I'll try to tap your dick.  You just tap on your shoulder right there, and I'll, I'll look at it.  Okay, I'm holding my shoulder, and he's lifting my arm very slowly behind.  Keep your knuckles from, from the beginning, I mean, from the middle of your back to your back  to your neck.  Now, what is this that you're doing?  Camora.  Don't hurt yourself.  Okay.  No, I won't.  Oh, that's a little bit unpleasant.  I can feel that.  A little bit.  Ah, okay. 
[02:58:00]  That was, that was very unpleasant.  Don't sue me, man.  No, no, no.  I, I, no, no.  I'm friggin'.  Yeah, right?  Back at Baldwin.  Good luck in the fight, man.  A leaky house.  Take care, guys.  Thank you, man.  Thanks so much.  Chris, thank you, man.  And, uh, you can go downtown tonight and see Chris at, uh, with Anderson Silva.  UFC gym on John Street.  All of the first 300 people are guaranteed autographs.  Yeah, because I knew he was doing it gently, but that last second was...  Thanks, man.  Long Island, brother. Long Island. Love it. 
[02:58:30]  That's great. We don't even have time to do anything.  Let's just bring up Michael Shannon.  We have Michael Shannon from Boardwalk Empire.  Can we have a water for him, too?  Let's, yeah, get a fresh water for him and bring him in.  Yes, Michael Shannon. Where is he? There he is. Come on in, my friend.  All right. Goddamn. How you doing, man?  Big fan.  What's up, Michael?  Big fan, sir.  Thank you.  Pleasure.  Take a seat.  Yeah, take a seat over there. Pop right on. 
[02:59:00]  We're actually on the air. We do that.  We just like...  Yeah, we do that. It's easier that way.  We don't have time to break.  We don't want to drop in a lobster in a boiling pot.  Right into the pot.  Watch him squirm.  Not you.  Yeah.  Something tells me not you.  I'm stoic.  Season professional. Stoic. Is that what you get a lot? You're stoic?  Stoic, crazy, evil, villain.  How much of that is you in real life?  None of it.  None? See, you're a regular guy, right? 
[02:59:30]  We don't believe it.  Well, yeah. I mean, as I was getting my daughter ready for school this morning, I didn't think,  this is my diabolical scheme.  I said, do you want to wear this dress or this dress?  Is the guy you're playing on Borowak Empire, which you're amazing on that, was that based on...  Because I don't know the real story of Nucky.  Like, I haven't read up because I don't want to know what happens.  Are you playing a real guy?  Van Alden, a.k.a. George Mueller, is a completely imaginary character. 
[03:00:00]  Okay.  They were very clear about that at the beginning.  Terry told me when I met with him, he said, you know, a lot of these characters are loosely based, such and so, blah, blah, blah.  But your guy is totally imaginary.  Some people thought at the get-go that it was based on Elliot Ness, but that was not accurate.  All right.  Gives you a little more leeway to do, you know, kind of what you want with him, a little more?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's like, where's Waldo?  You can just stick him anywhere. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  I mean, what's interesting is I am rubbing elbows with actual people.  Like Dean O'Banion, Al Capone, Nucky, of course.  These are all real people, so I'm just being inserted into these situations.  They're, you know, Buddy, the prohibition agent.  I'm sure that wasn't something that actually happened very often.  Right, right.  Yeah.  You started as a, yeah, you started as a prohibition agent, and it was really like a weird religious vibe to you, and then you drowned your partner in the lake, baptizing him, like, in front of all these black people. 
[03:01:00]  Like, it was a really fucking bizarre scene.  Boardwalk Empire throws curveballs.  Yeah.  Yeah, but what's really bizarre now is that, like, that's totally gone.  Like, I'm not doing that anymore.  Right.  I'm not, I haven't even tried to enforce any sort of laws for two, two and a half seasons now. 
[03:01:30]  Wow, yeah.  It's like selling irons and delivering flowers.  So it's kind of a weird change of events.  Do they tell you where the story is going?  So do you know if maybe in the future you're going to get back, or you're just at the mercy of each script?  No, they don't tell you anything.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, yeah, it's like working at some factory where you don't know what they're making. 
[03:02:00]  Just put on a black hood and get on the assembly line and go.  Something's coming in front of me, and I got to put part day.  I got to put it together.  Yeah, and then send it off on its way again.  Yeah, exactly.  What was the biggest script shock you got so far?  Like, because you have to, if you're reading along and it's not based on a real guy, they can do whatever they want.  Oh, there's so many.  There's so many.  I mean, I've got to say, season one, when it said the scene where Van Alden has sexual intercourse with Lucy, that was, that took a while to get over that. 
[03:02:30]  Pretty strange.  And that's when I knew that I wasn't going to be the good guy anymore.  Right.  So that was tough.  Basically, like any, basically every script, it seems like something really bad happens to me.  It's kind of like the setup of, like a guy on the sidewalk, someone drops a piano on his head or something. 
[03:03:00]  That's what it starts to feel like after a while.  Like, poor guy that's just walking on the sidewalk.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Getting nailed.  But I think he's finally due for, I don't know, to get his spine back.  He's just, he's been so, you know, it's really weird.  I had a conversation on the street the other day.  We were shooting a scene out in Yonkers, and this guy walked up to me, and he said, you know, I watch the show.  I really like the show.  I'm like, oh, well, thank you. 
[03:03:30]  And he's like, but I'm very glad I'm meeting you because I wanted to ask you, why is your character still on the show?  Oh, shit.  What is, what's the message with your character?  All the other characters make a lot of sense to me, but your character is, I don't know.  He just, where's the tension?  I don't know.  What's going on?  And I, it was kind of depressing.  No shit.  Yeah, because it was Steve Buscemi that said it.  Yeah, yeah, it's Steve.  I said, Steve, you know, we can't all be superstars like you. 
[03:04:00]  I love your character on this show.  Wow, that's brutal.  It's truly unpredictable and fairly psychotic-seemed.  I think, I hope they keep you on this show for the whole run.  Yeah, me too.  I mean, me too.  Maybe I'll do something eventually to wake this guy up.  I don't know.  Where were you raised?  Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.  You don't have any accent.  Well, that was quite some time ago. 
[03:04:30]  And my father lived in Chicago, so I went back and forth.  It's between Kentucky and Chicago.  I almost hear a little Chicago, but more so than Kentucky.  I just spent the summer in Chicago.  But I've been all over the world.  I like that song.  All over the world.  Did you try to get rid of the accent, or that just kind of happened?  Because people try to, like, they really try hard to get rid of the accent.  It comes back, you know.  If I go down there, it comes back.  I don't mind it. 
[03:05:00]  I'm not ashamed of my southern heritage.  It's where all the big movie stars come from.  Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise, George Clooney.  Yeah, yeah.  Kentucky.  Something in the water.  And Jennifer Lawrence, I might add.  The biggest starlet on planet Earth.  Right.  I watched The Iceman and thought it was fantastic.  Oh, thank you.  Great performance, man.  Just so frightening.  Because the way you played it wasn't like, you know, the normal movie hitman that you would see. 
[03:05:30]  It was frightening in your normalcy during your regular life.  And as a matter of fact, when you are with your daughters in the movie and you're just helping them get ready for school,  and, you know, you're not hatching some evil plot right there,  but then you're just so ready to and willing to kill somebody.  How much research did you have to do on the actual guy for that one? 
[03:06:00]  I did quite a bit, actually.  There's a very famous interview that he did for HBO.  Of course, yeah.  That a lot of people have seen.  It was edited down considerably to put it on TV.  So I got the full, unedited interview.  Oh, wow.  Which is like 20 hours.  Wow.  So I would watch that.  What did you think of him as a person when you were just watching that and not really considering your role in the movie, just as a person? 
[03:06:30]  I think, I mean, well, first of all, it's hard to separate that because I'm constantly looking at it from that point of view.  But I found him to be a very tragic figure because I do think he really had some authentic love for his family  and that he wanted to be a good person, but that he had been so kind of screwed up when he was a kid that he had this other aspect to his character that allowed him to do these things. 
[03:07:00]  And that was sad.  Do you find you're more sympathetic to a guy like that if you are researching for a role because you have to kind of delve into the things that made him that way instead of just going, oh, this fucking lunatic. 
[03:07:30]  Well, we all have our faults.  I mean, obviously his...  That's a little more than just...  Yours might be late as his was putting people in acid.  Yeah, you know, I don't know.  I mean, to me, I honestly, you know, I get a lot more pissed off at Ted Cruz reciting Dr. Seuss on the floor of the Senate than I do at, you know, Kuklinski saying, you know, there's a lot of negativity in the world. 
[03:08:00]  Well, yeah, that's for sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, it's a case study.  You know, I always feel kind of silly talking about, do I condone killing?  No, of course not.  I don't think anybody should kill anybody.  It's not right.  It's terrible.  But Richard Kuklinski was endured some pretty, I mean, as far as I can tell, some pretty savage stuff during his early childhood.  And, you know, that's one of the things I've always been fascinated by is how a person's childhood can shape who they become and why it's so important to not be, you know, sadistic to children. 
[03:08:30]  Because if you do that, then you can wind up with someone like Richard Kuklinski.  Your take on it was so spot on, though, where you talk about that, well, he wanted to be a nice guy.  You put that across very well with him and his wife and family.  I've talked to people that knew him, and he was very much, there was one man in particular who said that when he was a boy, 
[03:09:00]  Kuklinski would kind of keep an eye on him, give him, you know, spend time with him, give him advice or presents or whatever.  I mean, it was somebody that was a stand-up guy and he had no idea, you know, of this other side of him.  I mean, that's the thing that's also fascinating to me is the double life, the whole notion of how someone could have such two different sides to them. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  And I think what's ironic is that it comes from the same place.  Like, his ability to detach and do evil things and his desire to not be that way both come from the same foundation in his childhood.  Yeah, it was a great movie. 
[03:10:00]  I enjoyed it a lot.  And, of course, I guess you're going to be playing General Zod.  Am I going to be playing?  You are playing.  I played him.  It's done.  You played him.  I mean, we haven't seen it yet.  Yeah.  Everyone, of course, is familiar with the original Superman 2.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  But how differently did you play it than that one?  Do you have the same outfit on?  Than Terrence Stamp?  Yes, that's it.  Terrence Stamp.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's very different.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  You know, Zach, the director, told me when we were doing it that he wanted...  He wanted it to be more earnest and not so much like he's a villain.  He just happens to be a general on a different planet, and he's just trying to do his job.  Right, right.  His job is to protect Krypton, and that's not going very well.  And he's just trying to...  And once Krypton is destroyed, he says, well, I need to make another one. 
[03:11:00]  And it's not about...  He doesn't get off on manipulating people or controlling people.  He doesn't want people to kneel or do any of that crap.  He just wants a new Krypton.  That's all he wants.  No kneel before Zod.  No, you're not going to see that.  It is good, because that was kind of a one-dimensional kind of thing.  It was, oh, here's your bad guy.  Excuse me.  It looked like Terrence Stamp was having a lot of fun, which is great. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  And it was a lot of fun to watch him have a lot of fun.  But my guy is not having any fun.  That's a great way to describe Zod.  He's not having a lot of fun.  He's described it perfectly.  Can I ask you about your band?  Because you formed a band in 2002 called Corporal.  And you just released your first album in 2010.  Why did it take eight years?  Oh, well, both of those dates don't come from me directly. 
[03:12:00]  And I can't claim that either one of them are accurate.  I do know that I started playing.  When I started playing, when Corporal started, it was just me and one other guy.  And it was basically us just practicing every once in a while.  We made this album a few years ago.  I don't know if it's ever really gotten a proper release.  Like you can walk into The Virgin, buy it off the rack, 
[03:12:30]  although there aren't any virgins anymore.  Yeah, that's true.  In every sense of the word.  Yeah, exactly.  They're all gone.  All the virgins are gone.  But we're playing at the New Yorker Festival Friday, October 4th.  We're playing at the Bell House, which is in Brooklyn,  by the lovely Gowanus Canal.  Oh, boy.  What kind of music?  Eclectic.  Eclectic.  It says on our, oh, what's it called? 
[03:13:00]  When you go, the iTunes.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I'm a Neanderthal.  It says on iTunes on our site, it says German folk music.  Okay.  So I think that's, that absurd description kind of sums it up pretty nicely.  But seriously, like when people come to the shows, they say,  man, every song sounds completely different,  which is kind of what we're going for.  Because I went to see a band the other night.  I won't mention names, but every single song they played sound the same. 
[03:13:30]  So we try and avoid that.  Oh, I wondered what band it is now.  Yeah.  Were you at the Apollo Theater?  Taylor Swift?  I'm just kidding.  I'm kidding.  Of course.  I'm in the Taylor Swift.  Taylor Swift.  There's a lot of variety there.  That would be interesting seeing you at a Taylor Swift show, though.  Just towering over everyone.  Lurking backstage.  In the wings.  Just like Phantom of the Opera. 
[03:14:00]  What's your background?  Irish or German?  Well, don't you know.  Shannon, I would imagine.  I don't know.  Irish.  It's mysterious.  I'm just looking like you would actually do very well  on a period piece of a German soldier.  Have you ever played that?  I think they should write a movie around you based on a German soldier.  I think Ralph Fiennes did that.  Yes, he certainly did.  I don't know if I could do it any better than him.  I pardon you.  And, oh, that Inglourious Bastards.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't get a call for that one. 
[03:14:30]  God damn it.  You've been good on that one.  Let's see.  German soldier.  Yeah.  That could probably work.  But what do I know?  I've done so many military projects.  I mean, I've been a general.  I've been a sergeant.  I've been a lieutenant.  Really?  Yeah.  I've done a lot of military stuff.  Well, you're very sturdy looking.  But not German.  Yeah.  And not German.  Very stoic and a very, very...  Stoic.  There's that word.  But I'm saying that a very fucking intense gaze, which is kind of, you know, with the military.  I'm good with a bayonet, too. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So...  What's the silliest role you ever played?  Oh, there's so many.  That's the thing.  Let's have a little confab about that.  I was in a movie called Kangaroo Jack, which is completely absurd.  Uh-huh.  I was in Bad Boys 2.  I got my ear shot off and shoved in the trunk of a car.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  A little KKK action.  Yes.  That was...  Fuck yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I remember that. 
[03:15:30]  The brilliant absurdity of that.  Um, I did, uh, I did a short film called Mullet that's pretty funny.  Mullet?  Yeah.  Right.  Um, I did a movie called Grand Theft Parsons with Johnny Knoxville.  That's kind of a comedy that not many people have seen.  I guess, yeah, yeah.  Um, yeah, that's the thing is, like, I've done these other things, but, um, I guess the  things that most people have seen me in are the more, um, serious ones. 
[03:16:00]  A lot of people saw Bad Boys 2.  How long, how long have you been acting, like, professionally?  Oh, too long.  Too long.  Because...  23 years.  All right, so you're 23 years in the business, and within the past couple of years, really,  you've, you've made a name for yourself to where people look at you and go, oh,  I know this guy from, and they know where they know, it's not just like, I've seen him.  Or they ask me to explain to them why they know who I am. 
[03:16:30]  Or why you're on the show.  Yeah.  I actually, I hit a new level of notoriety.  Someone actually said to me, hey, I like some of your movies.  I was like, wow.  Because they used to just be like, I saw you in this movie, and now it's like, I like some  of your movies.  Why would people walk up to you and say something so obnoxious?  And insulting.  Why is everyone an asshole?  Why?  Everyone's got to be an asshole.  Are you on Twitter, by the way?  No.  Oh, good.  No, no.  Because you want a collection of assholes, you go to Twitter. 
[03:17:00]  You want your fucking ego brought down into the shitter.  It's like asshole barnacles.  Yeah.  To the shit.  They just stick there and have to literally be scraped off.  Yes.  Which would be the block.  Oh, my God.  You got a block.  Well, you were nominated, too, for Revolutionary Road.  I was.  I was nominated for Revolutionary Road.  I lost to Heath Ledger.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  It's a good one to lose to.  Yeah.  Well, I was just watching that movie again the other day, The Dark Knight. 
[03:17:30]  He's so good, man.  Yeah.  It's just amazing.  You know how hard it is to make the Joker or a comic book character Oscar-worthy?  It was.  It was ridiculous.  He put his heart and soul into that role, you can tell.  He just really got obsessed with it.  But, yeah, I got nominated.  I got to go to the show, anyway.  That was nice.  And Christopher Walken said something nice about me.  I can't remember what it was because I was in shock. 
[03:18:00]  Something nice, though?  Yeah.  Was it really nice, or I liked some of your movies nice?  Yeah.  Mike Shannon has been in some good films.  Thank you.  Thank you.  A percentage.  What a blast to have you on here, man.  Absolutely.  Michael Shannon, of course, Boardwalk Empire, Sundays, 9 p.m. on the great HBO, where, man,  the original programming there is fantastic.  Yeah, they do.  It's amazing.  Nice job.  Yeah.  Great to have you in.  Thanks.  You're tremendous.  Yeah, you're fucking funny as hell, man. 
[03:18:30]  Thank you.  I like it.  I like it.  Michael Shannon, thanks so much, man.  Jimmy, you got something to plug before we get out of here?  Yeah, my November 1st show with Dice at the Beacon is on sale now.  And the gig I'm doing at Doylestown is sold out.  Oh, five minutes.  And my advice show is from 10 to 11.  And I'll be here doing my advice show.  Yeah, listen to Jimmy.  And then I'm going to see my parents, and I have no idea what I'm going to do with them.  I'm panicking.  That's Michael.  Have fun with them.  My parents are coming into town for a couple hours today, from like 11 to 5, and I don't 
[03:19:00]  know what to do with them.  I don't know where to go.  It's his parents.  My apartment's very messy.  I can't bring them there.  Yeah.  Do they like museums?  Oh, that's a lot of museums here.  I thought of that.  It's not a bad idea.  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm so reluctant to go to the museum.  Museum.  You know, there's a good show at MoMA right now.  Oh, is there?  I don't think I'm going to see some MoMA.  Maybe I can get some scratch from pumping MoMA on the air.  Some scratch.  Wait, what's the good?  I have to know.  The show at MoMA. 
[03:19:30]  It's fantastic.  But what's the good show at MoMA?  Yeah, what's the show?  That's just like a history of American painting.  I'm not going to make it sound exciting.  They got that painting of the people at the restaurant.  You know, Elvis and Marilyn Monroe.  Oh, right.  James Dean.  Right.  But it's the real one, not the one you see at Spencer's Gift.  Yeah, exactly.  Are you playing Elvis in that movie about Nixon?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to give it the old college try. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, I bet everybody's waiting to see me fall on my face.  No, I don't know when it's going to happen.  It's kind of like far in the future.  Yeah.  I got to grow into it.  I think I'm still a little young.  It could be, right?  Elvis, that's just later.  That's the early 70s, kind of late 60s, early 70s, Elvis.  It's all starting to fall apart.  It's killing me.  He sounds like Stephen Wright.  Absolutely.  A little bit.  Wow. 
[03:20:30]  He's stoic.  Yeah, he is.  He pulls it off.  Yeah.  Well, you're great, Michael.  Absolutely.  Michael's having you.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks so much, man.  No problem.  Jimmy's up next with The Advice Show, so stay right where you are.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  But Jim Norton is not going anywhere.  If you have problems at a phone, it's your lucky day.  The Jim Norton Show is next.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor. 
[03:21:00]  And your chance to speak directly with him has arrived.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And The Jim Norton Show starts now.  Yadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadad 
[03:21:30]  looking. He's a handsome guy, but he's psychotic looking. And my parents are coming to town  in about an hour and a half. And they're only staying for four or five hours, but I don't  know what to do with them. Because my apartment, I just have my sofa and my living room is 
[03:22:00]  in disarray because I'm having furniture brought in. So it's just not ready for company. It's  embarrassing. So we would just be sitting there like three creeps. So I don't know what  to do with my parents in New York. I have no idea where to take them. I'm so bad at  this stuff. Usually if I see them, it's here or it's there. So I don't know what to fucking  do. So give the show a call if you would like some advice. I know a lot of people want to 
[03:22:30]  know what have I been listening to lately. I'll start right here before I even get to  the calls because they're just coming in. I'm going to say Unblackened. It's the new  live performance from Black Label Society, which is, of course, Zach Wild's band. I'm  from playing with Ozzy for many years. He's been with BLS for a long time, too. And this  is a great chance to see the band as never before. It was recorded earlier this year  in high def at Club Nokia in L.A. It's called Unblackened and it showcases the band's songs.  It's a more intimate setting than you've probably seen them at OzFest. And it doesn't lose any 
[03:23:00]  of the power or the intensity that people have come to expect from this group. You know,  Zach is legendary. They're saying legendary guitar is Zach Wild, but you know who he is.  But he performs on guitar and piano and he demonstrates the subtler side of 17 Black Label  Society classics, including Stillborn, In This River and Losing Your Mind. Zach has proven  time and time again that his songwriting, guitar and onstage persona, along with his larger  than life personality, have made him a force to be reckoned with. In addition to the concert 
[03:23:30]  Unblackened is rich in bonus material. A new interview with Zach. And he gives a great  interview. He's a brutally honest guy. Photo gallery, music video for Losing Your Mind  and a feature with Zach Wild visiting HM Prison Stockin. I don't know what that is. And it's  worded weirdly. HM Prison Stockin in the United Kingdom are all included. Unblackened is available  now on Blu-ray, DVD, two CDs and digitally. So get that and support Zach because it's a great  group and, you know, he's a tremendous front man. So let's see. Excuse me for clearing 
[03:24:00]  my throat. Let's see. Uh, Matthew in Westchester. Interesting question. Wondering if like, go  ahead, Matthew. Hey, Jim. How you doing? Good. Nice to talk to you. Thank you. So, um, during  sex and masturbation, I like my nipples play quick. Yeah, me too. And, uh, I was molested  as a child. So I don't know if that has anything to do with it. And I know you went through kind 
[03:24:30]  of the same shit as a child. I was never molested though. Never, never by an adult. Let me ask  you, um, with the, uh, the nipple play, who, who molested you first of all? Uh, uh, family  friends. Okay. Did they play with your nipples? No. Okay. So I don't see how that would tie  in. Um, cause it's not such a bizarre thing. Like, I think that's much more of a physical  thing and maybe psychological to a certain degree cause you get dependent upon it. But 
[03:25:00]  I like my, how old the guy are you? I'm 31. Okay. I'm 45. I didn't realize I liked my  nipples play with until my mid twenties. When did you start realizing it? Yeah. Yeah. In  my mid twenties. Now do you jerk off obsessively? No, I mean not obsessively. I have a girlfriend  and she'll play with my nipple. Yeah. Keith Robinson likes his nipples played  with. Um, you know, it's a weird, I don't know. Some of us do and some of us don't, but  I wouldn't equate that to molesting. If it was something that your molester did, then, then 
[03:25:30]  maybe like, you know, I, I knew a girl who, uh, was apparently molested by her father and  she liked that to act out incest fantasies involving father daughter and psychology Jim made  a connection. Like that's obvious, but I don't think nipple tweaking has anything to do with  being molested. That's just my take on it. Okay. All right. Uh, how do you know? You  know? All right. All right, Jim. Thank you very much. See you buddy. Well, and here's  something that kind of follows up with that. Matt in Boston wants to know, what do I think 
[03:26:00]  about a girl calling you daddy during sex? Hi Matt. Hey Jimmy. What's up, man? Hey, first  of all, are you her father? Uh, what? Are you, are you the girl's father? Oh, I wish. Um, I've  actually, I've met her father. Um, I've been seeing her for about a month now. How old  are you, Matt? And how old is she? I'm 23. She's 21. Oh, okay. Um, you know, I kind  of met her through, um, 12 step recovery, which is kind of weird, but, um, you know,  she's a good girl and, um, you know, we, we've been sleeping together and Sunday night 
[03:26:30]  was the first time we had sex. And, um, she was, you know, she was very playful. She,  you know, just started calling me daddy. She wanted me to pull her hair. Uh, at one point  she said, choke me, um, kind of inaudible. Um, you know, I'm kind of into it, but I'm  kind of just like, you know, what's this girl's history? Um, she's disgusted with me. She's  only been with like maybe three other men before me. Was she molested? Um, I don't 
[03:27:00]  know. Oh, okay. That's what I'm thinking. So you want to make sure that you're just  having some dirty fun and that you're not actually reliving a complete trauma. Yeah. It  sounds like one of Anthony's girls, you know? No. Okay. When it comes to, you know,  the, the daddy issues and whatnot. I do. I think that that kind of stuff can, I don't  think that's necessarily an unhealthy or incestuous thing, just some dirty role  play, but it can be, I don't know the girl. I don't know her history. And you  might want to find that out as you go along before you commit too much to the 
[03:27:30]  role play, but a little bit of rope. Now, was she asking you just to, was she just  calling you daddy and saying, pulling my hair? That could also be like dirty porn  stuff she's seen and not necessarily a tie-in to like a father figure daddy.  Right. Cause you're not, you're, you're her age. So it's like if she wanted  something that was fatherly, she'd probably pick somebody much older. Yeah. And I'm  definitely not a daddy type. I'm a skinny kid, you know, the five, 10, you know,  130. Yeah. Maybe she's just exploring that dirty thing. Maybe she's just heard it. 
[03:28:00]  Sometimes we just do things that sound, I've gotten into weird fetishes in my life or  weird moments, just thinking about them and going, wow, that might be fun. And then all  of a sudden I'm jerking off to it. And the next thing you know, I want to try it. So  maybe that's what this is for her. I would just find out if you can, if she was molested  and then try to avoid, you know, reliving her molestation. Yeah. Yeah. She also has the  rape fantasies and stuff too. A lot of women have that very common. Yes. Okay. A lot of  women have that. Um, they want to just be held down, but they want it with a safe guy 
[03:28:30]  like you, you're her boyfriend, you're a safe environment, you know, uh, girls that want to be  punched in the face, freak me out. I certainly don't want to do that, but somebody that wants  them to be submissive or held down or have some dirty fantasies, I think is fine. Good  luck, my friend. Enjoy it. Thank you, Jim. Hey, Billy in New Jersey needs relationship  advice. Fucked up a date by drinking too much. Hi, Billy. Hey, Jimmy. Um, yeah, I went out  with this girl for the first time, uh, the other night and, um, there's everything was going  great. Uh, we're vibing. Uh, she invites me up to her place and we kept drinking and, 
[03:29:00]  uh, we started, you know, fooling around a little bit and I'm like, you know, like the  last guy, I'm kind of a freak. I like, I ended up playing with like the player, like my  pair pulled up and this girl, not so much. She was more of a good girl. And I, apparently  I wasn't like, I don't know, I got a little too rough with her and my recollection of the  night is completely different than what happened because I was just really fucked up. And what, 
[03:29:30]  what she told me actually happened is got me like literally physically sick and I'm getting  these awful headaches and I just need to make it right. Cause I, I can't be known or remembered  as that guy. That's just a terrible fucking feeling. Let me ask you a question. How many  things have you messed up because you were drunk? Um, well, I mean, I've done stupid shit  before, but never anything quite like this. So it has you concerned? Yeah, it does. I mean,  I know that I have a problem and, but this is like the first really, like this is the first 
[03:30:00]  time it's really gotten me into trouble. Sure. Well, you don't need relationship advice.  What you need, I think. No, I don't need relationship advice. I need advice on how to fix this with  this particular person. Well, even in the particular person, the answer I would give you,  if it's a, does she want nothing to do with you? No, I was like, like before I realized how severe  it was, I was like, you know, just like give me a second chance or whatever. I'll show you that I'm  not like that asshole who drinks too much and does drugs. She was like, no, like you made me feel 
[03:30:30]  really awful. I don't know if I can even forgive you for this. Well then what you should do is one  of two things. You might have, you might've blown it with this girl. You might not have, but you  might have. And if you have, you have, it'll be hopefully the price you pay into stopping  drinking. I think that's what you might want to focus on. Yeah. That was my first reaction. I was  like, I got to stop doing this altogether now because even if this girl forgives you and you  go out, you're going to fuck up again, drunk. And if it's not with her, it's going to be with the 
[03:31:00]  next girl or it's going to be with a girl who you might really fall in love with and get married to.  It's going to continually, you just got a big shot fired across the bow. She's not the issue.  She's just one girl. The issue is the fact that you should address the drinking. It may help your  situation now or it may not, but it will absolutely help every other situation in your life.  All right. Thanks, Jimmy. There's no easy answer, buddy. You know what to do. Uh, if you know,  fix the drinking and you, and I've talked enough about how to do that, whether it's going to a 
[03:31:30]  meeting or going to a rehab, but that's the most important thing when you're fucking things up  because you're drinking. Um, trucker Bob has an idea of how for me to hang out with my parents. Yes.  Sure. Yeah. You guys are all good friends there. Give your old buddy Ant a call. Say, look,  man, how about I bring the parents by? We do a little karaoke, you know, a little bit  of drinking. I don't drink. Neither does my father. You can, you can have a, what they  call a non-alcoholic drinks there. All right. I can't, I can't burden Anthony. Hey, can 
[03:32:00]  me and my parents come over and just sit in your house? That'd be kind of weird. You're  going to take them to eat at least? Yeah. You got a restaurant picked out? No. Oh, she'd  take maybe down Chelsea, eat by the water. That's what I was thinking. Yeah. Something nice.  Nice and cold. You know, see how expensive it is. I'll keep looking at the price. Hey,  don't get that. I'll get the appetizer. All right. Thanks a lot, buddy. I appreciate  it. Uh, Kenyon in Utah. Is that your name? Has an issue with his mother. Hi. Or is it  with my mother? This is his issue with mom. Hey, what's going on, Jimmy? Hello. Kenyon  is your name? Yeah, that's my name, buddy. Hi, Kenyon. What's your issue? I have an issue 
[03:32:30]  with my mom. She seems to be very judgmental and, uh, has a problem with my drinking and wants  me to go to AA and everything. And I thought I would give you a call. How old are you? I  am 25. I'll be 26, buddy. Okay. Do you have a problem drinking? No, I don't have a problem  drinking. My mom and dad seem to think. Okay. So two people think you do. The two people  that probably know you the best think you do. Uh, who else has told you you have a problem 
[03:33:00]  drinking? I'm sure you've heard from at least one other person. Uh, my ex-girlfriend, which  is, uh, my baby's mama. Okay. So the three people closest to you think you have a problem  drinking? Yes, sir. And you're, you're in a place we call denial. You don't think you  have a problem drinking or maybe deep down on some level, you know, they're right, but  you don't want to admit it because admitting it is the first step in being forced to accept  it and address it. That is probably very true. So maybe your mom is judgmental and maybe she's 
[03:33:30]  whatever. But again, I think sometimes the issue here is if your mother is, even if she's shitty  about it, maybe cause you know, is your father a drinker? Yeah. He was a big alcoholic actually,  Jimmy. Is he sober? Uh, he's been sober for about 20 plus years. Okay. So, uh, maybe it's  hereditary. Maybe it runs in the family, but I think deep down you probably know that the issue  is not your mother being judgmental. Okay. Uh, the issue is probably, uh, you're drinking and 
[03:34:00]  maybe she's reacting poorly to it. And again, that's her problem. If she is, that she'll have  to deal with that as an adult. But the issue for you is, uh, what are you going to do about the  drinking? Cause if your mother and your father, your father who is sober and the mother of your  child all tell you, you have a problem with drinking and you probably do.  Huh? I mean, most people I know who are really sober people and don't drink are never told they  have a problem drinking. I actually didn't think about it like that, Jimmy. I always, I actually, 
[03:34:30]  I tried to always blame everybody else, but that's what we do as alcoholics. Or I say I as an  alcoholic, of course we did. There's no one better at blaming everyone than an alcoholic or drug  guy. We're the masters of it. It's what we do to avoid the, you know, that horrible image in the  mirror, which means I have to do something here. Um, so the drinking might be what you want to  address because again, your mother's going to be your mother, man. You can't fix her. You know, 
[03:35:00]  you're, you're, you're in your 26. Yeah. You're exactly right. You know, she's, I've only got one  mom, you know? Yeah. Yeah. But if the three of the, if she was the only one that ever said that,  I'd go out maybe, but, um, why don't you just listen to what they're saying? Even if you don't  like the way they're saying it and really closely examine it and try stopping for 90 days. How often  do you drink? Honestly, I would like to say at least every like couple of weeks. Now you only 
[03:35:30]  drink every couple of weeks. Yeah. And do you get drunk? It's pretty hardcore. Oh, it is pretty  hardcore. Yeah. So you might be what we call a periodic. There are like daily alcoholics and then  there's something called periodics who can go a long period of time without drinking. But when  they do, it's usually a fucking Lulu. Yeah, exactly. And, um, a lot of people are very functional  drunks. They can show up for work every day. There's all different varieties, but you might  be a periodic. Um, I was not, but a lot of people are. So why don't you try addressing that? And then 
[03:36:00]  in 90 days, see how you feel. Just give yourself three months. I mean, it's fucking, it's a September,  October, November, December. If you're not happy, you know, you can be fucking, uh, you can be  throwing booze back down your throat before the new year. All right. All right. All right.  Thank you so much, Jimmy. Good luck, buddy. Um, Dave in Massachusetts. Have I ever encountered  undercover police during my whoring days? Um, you mean, have I ever like stopped? I've been,  been like, uh, arrested? Never, never had a real law enforcement encounter. No. Well, 
[03:36:30]  in all that time, huh? No, but I was also very careful. Yeah. I passed up a lot, a lot of probably  regular girls. Cause I, there was something about them that was suspicious. I would never say certain  things until they were in the car. Like I would never say, Hey, how much for this? And I'll pull  over. I would always go, what are you doing? You know, you want to hang out? And they'll be like,  what are you looking for? I don't know. Just to kind of hang out. Yeah. How much you spend? And  well, maybe with his bag, you know, 30 bucks, but what do you, what do you want for that? I don't  know. Just to kind of hang out. We could talk, see how it goes. I was extraordinarily vague. I never, 
[03:37:00]  ever, ever said anything stupid. I was very careful. Hey, thanks for like doing like a,  like an out call kind of thing. You think like once you're there, it's pretty much all good.  Once you're there, I don't know. Cause a lot of times they're going to set you up.  If the police are going to set you up, it's probably going to be in a hotel or something.  Once they're inside your place, you're probably okay. Because a police officer is not going to  put themselves, they're not going to put a fellow officer in the danger of putting her in your car.  I don't think, or in your apartment alone. And they can't have video cameras next door taping it. 
[03:37:30]  So I think if they come to your place, you're better off. Okay. So you and you don't do  alcohol usually? Well, for them to do alcohol, I would always have preferred the girls to come  to me. Sure. Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good luck, buddy. Let's see here. Jim from Illinois going on a flight  for the first time. Any advice? Yeah. Thanks, Jimmy. I know you're the jet setter east and west. I  need some help. Are you scared? Are you scared? I'm a little nervous about flying. So, you know,  they say get there a couple hours early. You know, then I've heard like you and Patrice and those guys, 
[03:38:00]  when they fly, you know, at the TSA. I just, what can you give me for some pointers first time?  No matter how tempting it is, do not yell Allahu Akbar. Even though it's something fun to yell  on the TSA line. Where are you flying? How far is your flight? I'm flying out of the Quad Cities  in Illinois to Pensacola, Florida. I know it's going to be a small jet from here to Atlanta,  and then a big jet from Atlanta into Pensacola. Well, I would say get there. If I leave, 
[03:38:30]  how far do you lift the airport? Excuse me, Yachty. About 15 minutes. Okay. So you, I would leave  like maybe two hours before the flight. You'll probably get there. You really realistically need  to be there a little over an hour before the flight just to check in. Do you print your boarding pass  at home? Yeah. They said to print it up on Wednesday. We're leaving Thursday. Okay. Are you bringing  carry-on luggage only? One carry-on and then one bag to actually put on the plane. Okay. So you 
[03:39:00]  can't just go right to security. You have to check that one bag. I would say leave two hours before  the flight and just relax and enjoy it. It's safe, dude. It's really, really safe. And then you'll  land and they'll tell you where to go for your next one. It's not that hard. Okay. Now, sometimes I hear  like you say and other people say they give you an in-flight snack. Should I ask for chips  or what? What's that? Do I ask for chips or what? I can't do this all day, sir. I have an  advice show. Okay. Enjoy the flight. Thank you, sir. All right, my friend. Be good. Okay. Jimmy in 
[03:39:30]  Pennsylvania wants to know my take on hereditary drinking. I heard that a couple of callers  before you said it's hereditary. Yeah. You know, I've always heard that gene, whatever  it is that makes us who we are as addicts or alcoholics, sometimes it skips a generation.  Sometimes it's passed down. Sometimes it's learned. Like I, to be honest, I don't know 
[03:40:00]  exactly what goes into making something. Like I think I was born with that gene, whatever  that gene is. Okay. Cause well, my dad drank, he drank pretty heavy and I just, I'm about  the same way. Yeah. So that could be that gene that makes us crave it. Could be something  that you woke up with the first day you were alive, or it could be something that you just  began to do and learned. I just don't know. Yeah. Yeah. But either way, the issue is if  you're drinking really heavily. Yeah. Pretty heavy. Well, why don't you do something? You know, 
[03:40:30]  again, the example I always heard is, you know, we don't know exactly what happens when  somebody becomes an alcoholic, but, but the example, this guy, George, the bartender used  to give was you take a pick a cucumber and it's a cucumber and you dip it in the brine  or whatever it is that makes it and you dip it in. It's still a cucumber. You dip it in  and you pull it out. It's still a cucumber. But if you leave it in there, one day it becomes  a pickle and it never, no science can make it a cucumber again. Now that's a really cheesy 
[03:41:00]  example, but you don't know the exact moment that that happens. But once it happens, it  can't unhappen. Yeah. So if you've crossed that, what they say is that invisible line,  there is no going back. Yeah. So you might want to do something about it, especially since  you obviously see it. Absolutely. How old are you? 57. All right. 57 years young. So you're  57 years young, man. You probably have a lot of years left with the way technology and medicine  is why don't you, uh, you know, go take care of it and go do something and live the rest 
[03:41:30]  of your years without fucking dying of cirrhosis. Okay, my man. Good luck, buddy. Have a good  one. You too, man. Good luck. I was just looking up what you said. There is a, they did find  a gene that does have some, uh, effects for alcohol, alcoholism, but they say a lot of it  too is also your environment. Oh yeah. It could be both. So they found a gene, but it's still  not a hundred percent. Oh, okay. It's part of the environment as well. Yeah. Okay. That makes  sense. I think they'll, they'll, they'll learn to isolate it and, you know, get rid  of it eventually. Hi, Jason in Maine. Had an affair with Navy wife. Has an incriminating 
[03:42:00]  voicemail. Okay. Let me, what are you saying here, Jason? Hey, Jim, I had an affair with  a Navy, a wife. Her husband is in the Navy. He's gone for about the next six months. Okay.  Just before he deployed, he left me a voicemail after she confronted him and told him everything.  The voicemail was, um, violent and threatening. Sure. I've kept the voicemail for a year to protect  myself in case he comes at me and say, listen, you can come at me, but I'm going to turn this  over to the police and I'm going to cost you your career. Right. Um, how long do I keep 
[03:42:30]  this voicemail for? Uh, is it something I think I should, should keep forever? I mean,  what should I do? Well, do you have it saved on another source as well? I have it saved on  two USB drives and my phone. You're fine. Um, when did he make this threat? Uh, October  of last year. So it's, oh, it's a year at sea, but he's been at sea the entire time. Okay.  Well, he's had a year to cool down. And are you friends with this guy? No, we have no  connections whatsoever. It was a random occurrence. Have you spoken to her since? No, not at all. 
[03:43:00]  Then I ended everything like as soon as he left that voicemail. Okay. Um, I've gotten a  couple of those in my life too. Uh, it was a couple of times I just, I didn't know the  score. And, uh, first of all, somebody who leaves you a threatening voicemail, I think,  and again, I've got fucking Gavin DeBecker, but what they're doing is they're saying this.  I want this to stop it. If somebody is going to kill you, the odds are again, some cop may 
[03:43:30]  go, I'm an idiot, but I don't think they're going to warn you. Hey, I'm on my way over  to kill you. Sometimes people react. And now if you were there, he might've punched you  in the face or hit you with a hammer, but, uh, he left you the voicemail and he has not  left you another voicemail. No, no, but like I said, he's been, he's literally at  sea. Has he emailed you or contacted you in any way? Uh, he, that was the only way he  had to contact me was from her phone and I switched, I switched all my numbers, but I'm  a pretty public figure. I mean, I'm easy to find. He's not easy to find. Okay. Well 
[03:44:00]  then he could have found you and contacted you again. He didn't. Right. For him, it might  be over. Um, or his anger might just be at the person that should be, which is her.  Okay. Uh, I wouldn't obsess over it. Uh, I mean, I know it's easy for me to say here  in New York, all safe with sweetie rock in the studio, but, um, I think most people,  but I think the problem would be this. If you upped the ante by not respecting the fact  that he's a dog and he barked at you really fucking loud. And if you still walk over there 
[03:44:30]  and try to, to fuck with him, then he's got to up the ante to make you really know that  he means business. And that might be a very violent act. But I think if you, if you, if  he barked and he was right to bark and you backed off, then he accomplished what he wanted  to. Are you there? Oh, okay. If I hung up on you, it was an accident, man. I didn't mean  to. Hopefully you heard the end of it. Oh, you hung up. Okay. Thank you buddy for, uh, 
[03:45:00]  calling in. Let's see here. Garrett Detroit sleep apnea. It was, uh, I was reading the  paper yesterday and they seem to have found some cure, I guess, or treatment at least for  central apnea, which is what you have, isn't it? I have a com, I have complex apnea, which  is a combination of obstructive and central. What is the central treatment though? Uh, it's  like a pacemaker that they put into your head. Does it? Oh, okay. There was one that they 
[03:45:30]  said would stimulate a part of your throat, which stopped it from collapsing. But that  may have been to deal with obstructive. And they said it could be dangerous to constantly  stimulate this thing. They don't know what the after effects would be. Wow. I didn't  know that. I will look into that. Cause I have another sleep study coming up. It was supposed  to be this Monday, but I'm going to be in LA. I'm doing Leno Tuesday. So it'd have to be,  I'm doing it like four weeks now. Um, my, I'm doing the central, like the ASV test. So  thanks, man. I'll look into that. I appreciate it. It's out of Ohio State University is where 
[03:46:00]  I saw it. Okay. Well then, but, and plus it'll just keep getting better and better. They'll  cure it eventually. Exactly. Thanks for all you do, Jim. Thank you, Garrett. That's great  to hear. Uh, let's see here. Uh, something a little lighter. John in Port Jefferson, obsessed  with large pussy. Iraq, he's obviously a fan. I'm kidding. I think he's here. He's right  here. He's just shaking his head like Jim. Fuck you. Yes. Hi. Hi.  Jim. I'm good. How are you? I'm 52 years old. Yay. Okay. I'm going out with this 32 year 
[03:46:30]  old girl. Yes. She is absolutely beautiful, but she has the largest pussy I've ever seen  in my life and I'm obsessed with it. Well, immediately have her contact me. We need to  discuss this. I've never seen anything like this in my life, but let me, I gotta tell you  something else too. She is a freak in bed. I mean, squirts. Nice. Everything goes with  this girl and she's just a good girl. Only problem is she's only 32 years old. That's 
[03:47:00]  fine. And I don't know the age thing has got me. I don't know why. Why should it? How old  are you? I'm 52. That's fine. 20 years older than her. Big deal. I mean, uh, that's the  beauty of that's lucky. You should be happy. First of all, I want to see her vagina badly.  So if you have any photos, email them to me and I will be discreet and just jerk off on  my laptop. However, do never question why a girl, she's not, it's not like she's 18 and  you're 38. You know, you're 52. She's 32. She's old enough. She's paying taxes. She has a 
[03:47:30]  job. Her and her giant pussy like you. And maybe one of the things she likes about you  is that you appreciate her big pussy. Cause a lot of women are very self-conscious  about that. So maybe the fact that you appreciate what she is a little self-conscious about makes  her very happy with you. Yeah, I guess, but I'm telling you, I don't know. I just, it's  just the age. I notice I have a, I have a son that's almost her age. Yeah. Well, he doesn't  have a vagina. Here's the thing. Never lift, look a fucking a gift pussy in the mouth. You  have a younger woman. She likes fucking you. She has a big giant vag, which you love. 
[03:48:00]  She squirts and she's dirty. And then there's something in your mind that has to find something  wrong with the situation. I'll work on it. Enjoy it. And cause you could just as easily  be calling me going, this girl is my age. She has a tiny pussy and she's a dud in bed.  You know how many guys are in that situation? Be lucky and fucking enjoy it. Thank you so  much. All right, buddy. I'm jealous. You and your work hard at it. Enjoy my friend. 
[03:48:30]  And I'm going to get to Mike in Florida in just a second. Cause Mike wants to know,  then just give me a second, how I deal with anxiety. It's a good question, Mike. Um, and  I, cause I would often say to myself, like when I get fucking anxious, like, you know,  would I ever eat fake apples, uh, made from fillers and preservatives? Would I ever eat a  meatball made that way? Like most people, I mean, I want the, to be able to, to pronounce  every ingredient that goes into my food. That's anxiety causing. If you cook at home, 
[03:49:00]  you use real fresh ingredients. If you don't have time to cook from scratch,  Mama Mancini's meatballs is the answer for you. Now they were E-Rock sponsor.  They're a tremendous product. And I'm not just saying that cause I'm doing the read.  They are fucking delicious. Mama Mancini's starts with 100% USDA graded domestic beef  for their meatballs and all natural ingredients like genuine, uh, uh, pecorino,  rum nano cheese, onion, parsley, breadcrumbs, eggs, and a little salt and pepper. Real 
[03:49:30]  ingredients. That's it. No bullshit. You can't pronounce. Mama Mancini's famous slow  cooked Italian sauce is made just as simply as their meatballs. They start with the  whole Italian plum tomatoes, crush them, and then add natural seasoning. Mama Mancini's  adds their meatballs to the simmering slow cooked sauce for the perfect combination of  flavors. Since 1921, Mama Mancini's has never veered from Grandma Mancini's original  recipe. So they're not fancying it up. That's why it tastes good. Real ingredients just taste 
[03:50:00]  better. Mama Mancini's slow cooked Italian sauce and meatballs now available at your local  supermarket. So that's one way of dealing with anxiety, uh, Mike in Florida. Uh, Mike,  how are you? How you doing, Jimmy? Hey, buddy. Uh, I was just wondering, I remember a couple  years ago, I don't remember the entire break, but I remember you talking to ONA  pretty, uh, pretty indepthly about going for some serious heart testing and you were nervous  about, you know, it seemed as I remember you were nervous about, you know, things with your  heart. And that's something I'm always very anxious about. I'm 33 years old. I'm in really 
[03:50:30]  good health, but I always freak out thinking that like there's some undetectable heart issue  that I have.  Well, yeah, it's just a, you know, a little hypochondria. I went and got it tested and  they said I was okay. My, one of my right vents, they said, opens a little slower. They said,  yeah, just keep an eye on it every couple of years. But that's how I deal with the anxiety  is I get it checked. Like recently I've been talking about these breathing issues for years  and I went to a pulmon, uh, pulmon, whatever the fuck he is. Um, pulmonary doctor. And I 
[03:51:00]  went two days ago and he took an x-ray of the front of my chest and the back. So I've had  this tension, like there's a lead weight on my chest. A lot of times I want to take a deep  breath and I can't. And he goes, well, why do you want to take a deep breath? He goes, most  people don't take deep breaths all the time. He goes, you look around in the restaurant.  Everybody's sitting there going, he said, it's psychological. And he said, breathing  is a very sensory thing. He said, he'll tell people sometimes now hold your nose shut,  breathe through your mouth and walk across the room. Now, do you feel out of breath? And  a lot of times they do. And he said, it's psychological because you feel like you're 
[03:51:30]  not getting the same air because your sensory perception is different for the air going in.  So you feel like you're out of breath. He said, so much of it is in your head,  but he did take the x-rays and he did test me for asthma and he showed me the x-rays.  They were both perfectly normal, the front and the side. He goes, there's nothing wrong.  Your lungs are fine. And I did the test and he said, they're very good. I mean,  they're probably not what they would be at 20, but I smoked for 17 years. And he said that they're  fine. And the asthma test medication that he gave me did nothing to help my improvement. 
[03:52:00]  So he goes, you don't, you don't have asthma. He said, anything you're dealing with  psychological. So that made me relax a lot. So it's been better the last couple of days.  And I keep catching myself and I'm like, no, you don't need it. Relax. And it's been so much  better these last couple of days. So when you like, when you got like all the heart  tests and whatnot, like when you, right when they told you, you know, everything was fine,  that, that completely put you at ease. I wouldn't say completely because what happens  is you get, uh, you know, old, old, old tapes are hard to turn off. So I had become so accustomed 
[03:52:30]  to thinking a certain way and to reacting a certain way to not think about something  you're thinking about it. So it took a little bit of practice and a little while, but that  was a very, very important thing because I had the expert tell me I was okay. So it made  it really hard to convince myself that I was fucked up. Right. Okay. All right. Well, I'm  going to keep going. I go every couple of years. That's fine. Did you do it? That's  all you got to do. Good deal, man. I appreciate you. Be good.  Nolan in LA got an STD from fling with a girl at an airport. You fucked her in the 
[03:53:00]  airport, Nolan? Not in the airport. Uh, met this girl. We actually clicked. It was  great. Uh, had a great conversation. Um, we were in a flight from, uh, from New York  to Boston. Ended up hanging out in Boston with the girl. I gave her a ride to her hotel  from the airport. Just continued to, to have this like really strong connection. Slept with  her in Boston. I ended up taking the bus back down to come hang out with her again. And, 
[03:53:30]  uh, been Skyping with her like every day. And then after a month, she told me she's got  HPV. Uh, she reassured, reassured me. It was not the, not the kind that affects males, but  is only the kind that can cause pre-cancer cells in women. And I'm wondering if I should be worried  about this at all. Can I pass this on to another girl in the future? I've heard it goes away after  a little while. Um, I don't know. It's not, uh, HPV, I think can affect us. Uh, you can just get 
[03:54:00]  tested for it. I think there's a swipe they can do, but it's harder to, to, uh, I think she should  have told you first. Yeah, me too. And I bitched at her about it. Yeah. Um, go to, go, you know what?  Just go to your, just go to your doctor and ask him if they can swab it. Dr. Steve would be great  right here. Well, yeah, they can just dip a little fluid and swab it and just tell, but I don't,  there is a test for it. I think just go, go to a doctor. That's something I'm a little less  uh, I did call my clinic and they mentioned the only thing they can do is take a physical 
[03:54:30]  exam. I said there's no test for it. Oh, there's not. Okay. Which I found hard to believe, but,  uh, yeah, it doesn't show up on us as much. I guess, uh, moving forward, I'm still talking  to this girl and I'm still falling in love with her and she's in Florida right now until  she moves out to LA in a couple of months. But I'm finding all these shitty habits about  myself coming back to haunt me from previous relationships, like obsessing about what she's  doing, where she is. And I've only known this girl for a few days physically. Yeah. You 
[03:55:00]  might not want to start obsessing over a girl who had sex with you, uh, didn't tell you she  had HPV and now she lives in Florida. You know, you might want to give that one a little  while, get to know her. Yeah. Well, trying to get to know her over Skype, but it's like,  you know, when she moves out here, it's going to be sparks galore. Okay. Well, good luck,  my friend, and I hope you're healthy. Just go to the doctor. All right. Thanks a lot.  All right, buddy. Brian in Fargo, how do you get past the ritual of shooting up? 
[03:55:30]  Hey, front row center, Kansas City. You made fun of me and my girl for a change.  Thank you for coming. Um, or if I, you know, I appreciate it. Now are you off heroin or whatever  it was? Uh, no, uh, back in the day I was, uh, cranked, stayed clean for 20 years, backslid  for about five months last year. Wow. Okay. Okay. The ritual just is killing me. What do  you mean the ritual? What was your ritual? Uh, just the, the shooting up part, you know, 
[03:56:00]  getting the, getting the, the product ready, you know, in the spoon and sure you did in  the vein and it's making it hard. Are you going to meetings? Uh, no, I'm, uh, I'm a driver  and, uh, you know, I've got to stay clean for my job. But are you doing any type of 12  step work? No, not at all. Okay. So what you're doing is basically this, this undefeated  thing because it never, it never loses to anybody, um, wrecked your life. And then you 
[03:56:30]  get off it for a long time. You step back in the ring with it again. It knocked your teeth  out again. And you're still going at it alone. I mean, that's where they say the strength  in meetings and, and, and, and some type of a help with a fellowship is, is that together  we do what I can't do alone. It's an ego deflating thing. And a lot of people don't believe in  12 step stuff. Hey, that's cool for them. But for me, I was not able to do it by myself. 
[03:57:00]  I tried. And they say that in some of the writings, you know, and again, this is not just  about heroin. It's alcohol. It's all the same fucking thing. The drugs and the drinking,  uh, in single handed combat. Uh, we did very poorly. We do very poorly because there's no  one to bounce the sick thinking off of. So that ritual stuff you're talking about, do  you know how many people in recovery have dealt with that? So all these times that you're driving  your truck alone, you should be calling somebody who's in recovery and going, fuck man, I'm feeling 
[03:57:30]  that itch or I never shot up or whatever it is that sets that off for you. You should be calling  somebody who's gone through that and has gotten past it. They can go, Oh no, here's what I do.  And that happens. That's how you get through those things. Well, I, I, I did it on my own for 20  years. You've got past it. And you know, I've been doing it since the first of the year, this time  it's always in the back of the mind. Right. So the obsession, so basically you're just going to  white knuckle it for the rest of your life. And the 20 years that you got past it, you obviously 
[03:58:00]  didn't get past it because there was something in a foundation there that you missed. Like who goes  back to, who goes back to shooting dope after 20 years? Like, dude, that's crazy. I know it is. I  know it is. I got hurt on the job and you know, I suffer from depression, bipolar, you know, and it  just kind of, uh, the injury knocked me down and I fell back and, you know, got back to work and  now I'm good again, at least, you know, in my mind, you know what I mean? But there's something 
[03:58:30]  inside of, there's something inside of you that is craving that. And it's, it's tickling you. It's  like a tickle or an itch. The idea, uh, where, when you want to smell something, it's just that idea  that, that ritual, that fucking hammering at you in the back of your mind, the way to get rid of that  or the way to manage that. My suggestion is go to a 12 step group. Like I tell people whenever  they bring this stuff up and you talk to people who have been through it. And I wish I had a faster  answer for you. Carrot juice and a finger in your ass. That's all you need. I wish there was a, 
[03:59:00]  you know what I mean? But there's not, unfortunately there is an answer. There's two options here. I wish  there was an easier one for you. Um, but there's not, but there is something. It beats the option of,  there's nothing. And you're going to feel this for the rest of your life. If I was still white  knuckling it, I never, ever would have gotten into recovery, stayed in recovery ever. Yeah. And  a little personality problems and little thing, the defects in your character and all this shit 
[03:59:30]  that caused you to relapse or caused you to be unmanageable. All that stuff is still going to be  there unless you work on it. Yeah. Yeah. And for that guy with the younger chick, I'm 54 and married  my girl. She just turned 32. Oh, good luck. My friend. I'm happy to hear that. Good luck to the  other guy. But yeah, dude, really do something about that. Cause you don't want to fuck it up  and relapse again. Because I think the time between relapses now is going to be shorter and  shorter and you're not guaranteed to get clean. You're not guaranteed to come back. Yeah. That's 
[04:00:00]  what scares me that, that time between. Well, it should scare you. It absolutely should.  Yeah. Thanks, Jim. You make me laugh. You prefer laugh and appreciate it. All right. Good luck,  man. Drew in West Virginia, trouble getting off with his girlfriend. Hi, Drew. Jimmy, what's up,  buddy? Hey, buddy. Big fan. Thank you. I love the show. Thank you. I've been seeing this chick now  for a while. She's smoking hot and everything. I love hanging out with her. Let's spend a time with 
[04:00:30]  her. But it's like, I'm only 30 and I'm having trouble just getting a rod, like hanging out with  her to the point where I'm like trying to avoid sex at this point. Yeah. Um, I don't think it's  me physically. Like I said, I'm only 30 and I'd like to say that it's all, you know, pretty decent  shape down there. How long you with her? I'm sorry. Um, I've been seeing her throughout the  summer and stuff. And, uh, you know, we spend a good deal of time together. Do you like her as a  person? I love her as a person. I love hanging out with her and spending time with her. 
[04:01:00]  Are you physically attracted to her? That's the thing I'm trying to figure out. I am. Cause  like I said, she's hot. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Hot. The looks do not matter. We know  that on the outside, that's a thing that we understand and comprehend, but that does not  mean you're going to be sexually attracted to somebody at all. So it could be a couple of  things. You really like her and you're nervous. And sometimes we put pressure on ourselves or as  men, when we don't feel sexual attraction for somebody, it's so drilled into us that we're 
[04:01:30]  supposed to, we feel like something's wrong with us. Sometimes I've looked at my dick and my dick is,  you know, I quit many times and there's been times where I've been annoyed. It's because I've been  nervous. And there was times where I realized my dick was right. I just wasn't as attracted to this  person as my head was telling me. I didn't have that chemical thing with them. I would avoid sex.  I would avoid, you know, I didn't want it. I would try to go to sleep without having to fuck. 
[04:02:00]  And I felt like there was something wrong with me. There wasn't, I just wasn't as sexually  attracted as I thought I should have been. Yeah. Now you've been sexually attracted to other girls,  right? Oh yeah. I mean, definitely. I mean, she's not like my quote unquote type, but like I said,  she's definitely, you know, attracted. She definitely, um, the thing with her too is she likes chicks as well.  Yeah. So I, you know, I found that out a little later on and she doesn't really want to have  any kind of serious relationship because she's more into dicks than she is dudes in that sense.  Sure. But, um, I think when she told me that something like subliminally clicked in my head 
[04:02:30]  too, that even further made it like, okay, you know, like we're really going to have a long  term shot with it. So it kind of, maybe your phone, we're going to let you go cause your phone  is cutting off. Uh, but I appreciate the call drew. And I would say this, just be honest with  yourself. Not that you're not being, but just kind of think about it and go, look, is my dick quitting  because I'm panicking and uncomfortable or do I just not have the feeling that as a man I'm taught, 
[04:03:00]  I'm always supposed to have. Maybe you just don't have that feeling with this girl. And that happens  sometimes no matter what they look like, it doesn't matter. I've dated, uh, you know, a couple of really  beautiful girls. I just did not have sexual chemistry with, and I'm sure they were great fucks,  but it just, there was something about our chemistry that just didn't sync up. Neither of us was right.  I mean, she was probably right, but that's the way it was. So don't, you know, just because your  dick is not working and you can't get off, maybe she's just not what you need in that area. Uh, 
[04:03:30]  let's see here. Uh, Texas wants advice on quitting smoking. Hello. Hey, Jim. Uh, how's it going, bud?  Hi. Uh, yeah, I was calling to find out. Um, I didn't realize that you used to be a smoker.  Yeah. For 17 years. Yeah. You talk a lot about the drugs and alcohol and stuff, but I was,  I was calling to find out, man, if you had any advice for how to quit, how'd you do it? I mean,  what's your, uh, I kicked drinking and drugs with no problem, but the smoking's hard. Well, 
[04:04:00]  I'll tell you what works for me at, I had a moment of clarity and I said, I was going to quit. It was,  I think it was December 7th, 2001. So I went down to the comedy cellar that night and they were still  smoking in the club. Esty, who, uh, the woman who runs the comedy cellar who had quit smoking,  physically grabbed my hand and marched me down the store to the pharmacy and got me the patch.  Now the patch, I think was a three week program or 21, whatever the program length was.  What I did was I wore the patch every day as prescribed. I didn't cut it off after a week. 
[04:04:30]  No, I'm good with this. I didn't shoot Nicorette with it. I did what they suggested and it worked.  I drank a lot of water and I wrote, I wrote down, they had this little thing. You write down the five  advantages to quitting smoking. And, um, that helped me a lot. And Colin Quinn, I've, I've credited  Colin a lot for this. We were talking once and he said something very simple. He said, you have to  realize the urge to smoke is going to pass whether you smoke or not. And I never forgot that. So I would 
[04:05:00]  be jonesing for a cigarette and realize this will pass. And then I would drink some water,  um, because that fucking physical motion of hand to mouth, but it is possible to quit.  And it's by far the best thing I've ever done. So, uh, you don't want to, you want to get tumors  in your mouth. Start, you know, look up photos of people who have mouth cancer. That was a motivator  to, um, look up those pictures of what somebody's gums look like when it's been fucking eaten away  with mouth cancer. Now I'm not, you can't scare someone into quitting an addiction, but it does 
[04:05:30]  help to be practical. You don't want that to be your mouth. Sure. Yeah, absolutely. And we recently  had a baby and all that good stuff. So I'm looking forward to getting out from underneath it, man,  but it's, it hasn't been easy. First thing you do, you quit, you get the patch or whatever it is  that works, Nicorette, do it as prescribed and then go to the dentist and get your teeth and gums  cleaned immediately. This way your breath won't stink and you'll feel cleaner in your  mouth. You'll notice the difference because they got to scrape all that fucking shit out 
[04:06:00]  from under your gums and that disgusting taste. Man, when they get under your gums, it's a little  unpleasant, but man, the feeling you have when you walk out of that dentist, she also get your  nails done to get your nails done. Yeah. And that yellow funk will come off. You start washing down  the house. Uh, but dude, I would suggest it's the best thing I ever did. Thank you so much. Good luck.  Excuse me for sniffling again. Uh, how much time we got? You got about three minutes.  Okay. Three, we got a couple minutes. Uh, let's see here. Should I get a hair transplant or plugs 
[04:06:30]  or something? Um, Anthony from Long Island. No, I'm kidding. Uh, hello, Canada. Hi, Canada.  Hey, how are you? Good. How are you? Good. Look, uh, I'm a mid thirties. I started losing my hair  like in my early twenties. Uh, I'm married. I got two kids. I have a beautiful wife, but I, for some reason  can't get over that hump where people are like, ah, just let it go. It's all right. I cannot. 
[04:07:00]  It's driving me crazy. Yeah. It's a big thing for men. I thought by now I'd be over it. I honestly  did. I constantly lie to myself, like tell myself the, the, the cliche things you're supposed to  say. Like, look, I have a beautiful wife. I'm married. Who cares at this point? But I can't get  over it. I considered myself a decent looking guy. And, uh, every time I look in the mirror,  that's all I see. Sure. Sure. The flaw. I know that they've gotten better now with like hair  transplants and stuff. I know a lot of like celebrities have even come out and said that  they've done it. Like guys like, uh, Mark Jacobs, you know, like a designer slash model 
[04:07:30]  and, uh, Matthew McConaughey. And there's guys like that, that it's obvious they've done  it. They've had it. It's been done well, but I'm so paranoid that I'm going to look like a,  like a Kiwi. You know, I'm so scared that I'm going to go get it done. It's going to look  ridiculous. Well, Anthony had, Anthony had it done with the harvest area and, um, I follicle  replacement, whatever it is. It's a long process. Like it's a long day, but it takes a couple  of weeks. It's kind of expensive, but if you want, if you don't want to play a Kiwi,  I think they've gotten a lot better where, you know, it looked like they were just hammering  in hair nails. I think it looks much better now, but just again, do the research, do your 
[04:08:00]  research and find a place that is reputable and has good reviews. I mean, it's like anything  else. You got to do a little bit of the legwork, but if you really mean something to you and  you're in your thirties, then do it. I mean, as long as you're not taking food out of your  wife and your kid's mouth or you're not shirking real responsibilities at home. I mean, why not?  No, I can, I can afford it. The other thing that I'm paranoid about, paranoid, I don't  want, I know I come off like a ego maniac here, but it's also getting it done and people  that, you know, prior and post is it, it's not seen like a, like a boob job anymore. 
[04:08:30]  You know, where people are like, Oh, you got your boobs done. Good for you or whatever.  Yeah. And who cares? By the way, who cares what they think? Because they're not the ones  who look back at you in the mirror. You are. So who cares what they think? Well, you, you  have to be comfortable with you. So if you want to do it, go do it. Okay.  You know, cause you know, fake hair is okay. I mean, personally, I would never eat a fake  apple made from fillers and other preservatives. I mean, you might, I wouldn't, you know, would  a meatball made that way? Absolutely not. Fake hair is okay. A fake meatball. Fuck you. 
[04:09:00]  Like most people, my friends, you want to be able to pronounce every ingredient that goes  into your food. It's just something healthy and natural feeling about that. If you cook at  home, you use real fresh ingredients. If you don't have time to cook from scratch, Mama Mancini's  will save you time because their meatballs are the answer for you. Mama Mancini starts  with 100% USDA graded domestic beef for their meatballs and all natural ingredients like genuine 
[04:09:30]  pecorino, I can never say that word. Pecorino. Pecorino. I said it wrong. Like I did. Romano  cheese, onion, parsley, breadcrumbs, eggs, and a little salt and pepper. It's delicious. And  we've eaten them. They honestly, they're fucking phenomenal. Real ingredients. That's it. Mama  Mancini's famous slow cooked Italian sauce is made just as simply as their meatballs. They  start with the whole Italian plum tomatoes, crush them, and then add natural seasonings.  Mama Mancini's adds their meatballs to the simmering slow cooked sauce for the perfect combination 
[04:10:00]  of flavors. Since 1921, Mama Mancini's has never veered from Grandma Mancini's original recipe.  Real ingredients. They just taste better. That's it. You know that because everyone always eats  out and they go, it doesn't taste like my mother's or my grandmother's. That's because  the restaurants are using too much salt and shit ingredients. Mama Mancini's slow cooked Italian  sauce and meatballs now available at your local supermarket. And they brought them in here and  they're amazing. And they have turkey meatballs and all this great shit. So, I mean, I should 
[04:10:30]  probably say not great shit, but the food is excellent. I apologize to anybody who I did  not get to. Are we out of time? We're totally out of time. I will see you guys. Don't forget  November 1st. I'm with Andrew Dice Clay at the Beacon Theater and stick around for Fez and  Ron, the new name of that show. </pre>
