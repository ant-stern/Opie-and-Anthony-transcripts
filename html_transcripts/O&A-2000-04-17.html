<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts struggling to edit a station ID recorded by Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka, whose pronunciation of "1027 WNEW" proved exceptionally challenging.  This was followed by the airing of a highly profane audio clip of former Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver responding to fan questions with a barrage of curses and insults.

A caller, Donnie Brosco, then recounted his unlikely discovery of both the Opie and Anthony Show and God while incarcerated.  Another caller provided a description of a billboard in Times Square. The broadcast continued with entries from their "Most Offensive Song Contest," highlighting a particularly graphic and disturbing submission titled "Stuck in an Oven with Juice," submitted anonymously by "The Maestro." This song contained extremely offensive language and imagery related to the Holocaust.  Callers reacted to the song with a mixed response, ranging from indifference to amusement.

The show concluded with the "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, featuring sarcastic and humorous commentary from callers regarding the difficulties with Snuka's station ID, the overall chaotic nature of the broadcast, and the noticeable absence of their usual phone screener, "Spaz."  Outtakes from a drug commercial featuring Psycho Mark were played, showcasing the stark contrast between his sober and intoxicated voiceovers. The broadcast ended with further chaotic and offensive comments from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hello?  Yeah, I thought I'd inject little intelligence to this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Hokey and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  What a day we're having.  Woo-hoo!  Yeah.  Yeah, I gotta do it, boy.  Talk radio at its best.  Wow.  Superfly checking in, Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, yeah?  Brothers, the IRS.  Lovely brothers.  Brothers.  Lovely.  Lovely.  I love them, brother.  Great.  Wonderful.  Can we play the Superfly ID again, please?  Yeah, I want to hear that.  I want to look at that scramble, Blake.  Psycho Mark, you were in there with Superfly Jimmy Snuka.  You asked him to cut an ID for our radio show.  And how was it in there? 
[00:01:00]  Torturous.  It was effing torture.  Ponderous.  It was ponderous.  Well, it only took a minute and 20.  Yeah, it was a minute and 20 worth of joy.  I hear this thing was twice as long.  You just cut it down.  It was probably about four minutes total.  Just trying to get him to say 1027.  Yeah.  And WNEW within a certain amount of time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Impossible.  Impossible.  All right.  Let's listen to this thing again. 
[00:01:30]  Controus.  Okay.  O.P. and Anthony.  On 1, 2.7.  On 1, 2.7.  Mm-hmm.  O.P. and Anthony.  1, 0, 2.7.  Mm-hmm.  This is a super fly, Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony on 1, 0, 2, 0, 7. 
[00:02:00]  Mm-hmm.  On WNEW.  All right.  All right.  Again, 1, 2.7.  1, 0, 2.7.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We saw 1, 2, 7.  Okay.  1, 0, 2, 7.  On WNEW.  You want to say his name and stuff first?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Say anything ahead is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  One more time, and I'll edit that in. 
[00:02:30]  Mr. Superfly, Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony on 1, 0, 2, 7.  WNEW.  Oh, Superfly, Jimmy Snooker on your radio doll.  Radio doll.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Wow.  Oof.  That's, uh...  You got to put that in your machine right next to...  Okay, terrific. 
[00:03:00]  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Oh, my God.  I could have gone out for a coffee between the 1, 0, 2, 7s.  Who knew?  What happened?  Who knew?  Yeah.  One moment he's flying off that top turnbuckle, and the next...  Scrambled eggs.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The other thing we got to play really fast here is the Earl Weaver.  Oh, yeah.  I love Earl Weaver.  This is great.  Earl Weaver was the manager of the Baltimore Orioles back in the 70s there. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And the 80s.  And he was doing some talk show.  I guess he had a little bit every week called, I don't know, Earl's Corner or something, and  he would, you know, do a little show, and they would ask him questions about the team and  what he's thinking and stuff.  Yeah.  What an ornery old F.  What a miserable...  They caught him on a bad day, and there's some great audio.  Listen to the guy, the straight guy that's doing the sports show. 
[00:04:00]  He's not fazed by the whole thing.  He just keeps plowing along.  But here it is.  Earl Weaver, everyone.  Check this out.  Up now, the manager's corner.  With the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager, the Orioles, Earl  Weaver.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer from Frederick Merrill, wants  to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed. 
[00:04:30]  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get some goddamn little fleas on a f***ing basis, getting picked off, trying to steal,  getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big f***suckers that can hit the f***ing ball out of the ballpark, and you  can't make any goddamn mistakes.  Well, certainly this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  So, Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C., wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as  a designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in f***ing baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds. 
[00:05:00]  He was released by the f***ing goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his f***ing ass for eight innings and enjoy watching  a baseball game, just like any other fan, and has the ability to get up there and break  one open in the f***ing ninth.  So, if this f***s occurred to nine in his own business, and let me manage the f***ing team,  we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball,  Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the f*** her next lane's coming from, rather 
[00:05:30]  than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out to f***ing bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street,  she might get a f*** stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, time.  That's about it from Managers Corner.  Go f*** yourself and the f*** with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball  f***ing Network.  Wow!  That's awesome!  I love that clip! 
[00:06:00]  Out of control!  I love that clip!  And this just in from Haywood.  Yeah.  Haywood?  Yep.  Did Superfly go to Iona College?  Yeah, maybe that's it.  We never thought of that.  Superfly's Week in Review, coming up Friday.  Donnie Brosco wants to say hi.  Donnie Brosco!  Oh, and hey, what's the deal?  What's the deal, yo?  Not much, man.  You guys are the best.  I just found you guys about four months ago. 
[00:06:30]  I went into jail in December, and I found you guys in jail along with God.  Along with God.  You found us and God in jail.  You got about a thousand faithful listeners in there, man.  You don't even realize.  The captive audience.  We love it.  Yeah, I just got out on Wednesday.  Figured I'd tell you guys how much you guys rule and suck and all that good stuff.  And you guys got me through my bid pretty quick.  How long were you away?  I wasn't there four months.  No biggie, you know?  Yeah.  I thought it was all dirty in there, but I wasn't sure.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I saw him at 72, actually.  So how do you find our show and God at the same time? 
[00:07:00]  Well, let's see.  A lot of people find God in jail, and then everyone finds ONA in jail.  I mean, I found them in there.  I never knew they existed before I was in there.  Yeah.  You know, it's pretty crazy.  All right.  You guys are great, man.  Well, thank you, Donnie.  Get me down there with some strippers or something, man.  It's kind of on Wednesday.  That's the deal.  Give me some wrestling tickets or something, man.  Have you gotten laid yet?  Honestly, not yet, man.  No?  I got to deal with my probation and all that stuff, you know?  I got to get all that stuff situated first. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  Before I start messing around up there.  All right, man.  All right?  Well, thank you, Donnie.  Keep in touch.  We're doing a real radio show.  We'll have you down here.  No doubt.  No doubt.  All right, man.  All right.  Bye.  It's been a mess of a day.  Paul, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, how are you there, Donnie?  How are you doing?  Hey, Paul.  What's up?  Hey, not much.  Yo, check this out.  I was in Times Square before.  And there's a billboard in small letters.  I don't know if you want me to give it a name of the dot-com company. 
[00:08:00]  I don't care.  It says AvenueO.com in small letters.  And in huge letters, it says, wow.  Nice.  So there's a wild billboard in Times Square.  Yeah, of course.  I wish it was a course from URL to teach them dogs a lesson.  Yeah, that would be good.  Hey, what happened to your friends in song contest?  My phone's dying.  I'll get you later.  All right.  Bye.  Wow, that's a good setup.  We're about to play our latest entry.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  And what is this?  This could be the last entry.  We haven't gotten many songs lately.  Which one is this?  Have I heard this?  This is brutal, Ant.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, so we've got to preface the thing again here.  We've been doing the most offensive song contest, looking for the most offensive song out there.  We've had some winners, that's for sure.  We understand they're offensive.  I wanted to end this thing weeks ago.  You guys all called me a pussy.  Yeah.  Said keep the contest going. 
[00:09:00]  We understand that it's meant to be offensive and all that.  Right?  Yeah.  What else can we say before we play this damn thing?  Well, it's the offensive song contest, so if you're offended, then it's doing its job.  Yeah.  We're not playing this for the humor value, Opie.  No.  This is a contest.  And how are we going to get a winner?  Because we're just about done with the contest.  I don't think we're getting any more entries.  This could be the last entry.  I was hoping we'd do the final judging at a live performance.  That's been put on hold.  Oh, Jesus.  Our whole lives have been put on hold. 
[00:09:30]  Hold.  I know.  I don't know.  Then we're just going to have to pick something out of a hat.  What do I know?  I think through the unofficial website.  Yeah, the voting continues.  Yeah, they're taking votes at www.foundrymusic.com.  Are you ready for the latest entry, Anthony?  Mm-hmm.  It's called Stuck in an Oven with Juice.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh.  Already?  That's that frigging crazy? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, this one's brutal.  I understand it's brutal.  Who wrote this?  Psycho Mark Furman.  Psycho Mark Furman.  No.  What sucks about these songs, you know, they don't take credit for them.  They just send them in in a paper envelope.  Envelope, no name, no return address.  Actually, no, we do have a...  Oh, you have a name on this one?  He calls himself the Maestro.  The Maestro.  See, no one uses real names, nothing. 
[00:10:30]  He calls himself the Maestro.  And we do have a ton of stuff we're going to give away to the winner of the Most Offensive Song Contest.  Yeah, plus we're going to send it up to what?  Guinness?  Yeah, but no one has, you know, claimed responsibility for any of these songs, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  Some of the names that have sent in songs, Q, Fuel, The Maestro.  Pseudonyms.  Ant's brother.  Ant's brother.  Yeah.  All right, man.  I'm warning you.  If you're easily offended, turn off your radio.  I don't want to hear about it. 
[00:11:00]  We already understand how offensive this song is.  That's the purpose of it.  All right, with that, here it is.  For whatever it's worth, check it out.  Well, I'm not sure how I got here today.  The Nazi soakers came and took me away.  They won't believe that my real name is Schmidt.  So they dumped my house up here at Ashwitz.  I'm just to the left of me, right back to the right. 
[00:11:30]  Here I am sucking in a oven with juice.  Yeah, I work all day without any rest.  It's got to mingle and want spit to test.  I've got a feeling they'll be doing me harm.  Place of these knuckles, they've tattooed on my arm.  What's up, John?  Leaves to the left of me.  Drive back to the right.  Here I am sucking in an oven with juice.  Well, I told them I was German, but that fact did not concern them in the least. 
[00:12:00]  Every day I get it beaten, and you know I have it beaten in three.  Oh, man, this is just bad.  I told you.  Well, I'm tired, hungry, dirty, and cold.  And they pulled out all my teeth both and gold.  I've got to tell them about the mistake they made 
[00:12:30]  before my skin ends up on someone's left shape.  Leaves to the left of me.  High me to the right.  Here I am sucking in an oven with juice.  Here I am sucking in an oven with juice.  Let me out sucking in an oven with juice.  Dirty cows sucking in an oven with juice.  Oh, man, is that bad?  Oof.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:13:00]  Wow, I told you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  I told you.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, I love it, but Rick's singing it a lot.  Oh, my God.  Jake, what's up?  Hello?  Hey.  I want to say, you know, you know Passover's in two days?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the best song, man.  That is the best.  That's the winner.  Yeah, we should have played it Wednesday.  That's good.  I was in this day in the rain with the unedited sound of the girl on the chair with her boyfriend 
[00:13:30]  the other day.  The chair?  Oh.  We were playing Guess What Whoever is Doing.  Oh, Guess What Jane's Doing?  Yeah.  That's an amazing thing.  Can you end the day with that?  I don't think so.  No.  We got in a little trouble with that one.  Oh, that was a great one.  All right.  Thank you, Jake.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Eric is Jewish.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Bone Egg?  How are you?  All right.  The name of that song, I was expecting a lot worse. 
[00:14:00]  I thought that was a disappointment.  I'm Jewish, and I wasn't even offended a little bit.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, very good.  Oh, I don't know.  I think that's a pitiful loser right there.  All right.  I know.  Well, thank you, Eric.  All right.  Thanks, Tony.  You guys are awesome.  All right, man.  Let's go to Andrew.  Andrew, you're next on WNAW.  Andrew?  Yeah.  What's up?  Andrew?  Yeah.  You're on the show.  Let's go.  That was too funny.  Oh, you liked the song? 
[00:14:30]  No, you liked it.  I'm a Jewish guy.  That was just too funny, man.  Hey, look at that.  All right, Andrew.  Thank you.  All right, thanks.  The singing was very offensive, right, Ant?  Yeah.  Well, his harmonies were kind of there.  You know, you've got to give him that.  Drunk Ed.  Hello?  Hello?  I like to say that's a very good song.  Hello?  Can we end the show, like, right now?  Wouldn't that be nice?  Can we, like, just go home?  Is there something we can play?  Wouldn't that rule? 
[00:15:00]  Let's just write off this show and start the week tomorrow.  It happens sometimes.  What a mess.  Cluster F, it's called.  I'll tell you one thing.  As much as you guys hate and complain about Spaz, he is the reason why the phone calls  suck today.  Yeah, he screens them, and he's not here today.  Spaz took the day off.  I'm telling you guys, you hate him, but the guy does a great job when it comes to screening  the calls for our radio show.  It's like a monkey.  You train him to do one thing.  Nothing against Stinky.  Nothing against Stinky who's doing it today and filling in and doing the best he can, 
[00:15:30]  but Spaz has been doing it a long time.  He understands the show, believe it or not, and he usually gets rid of all these people.  Yeah.  Why would you put a guy through that's doing a horrible Asian impression?  Spaz wouldn't do that.  Spaz is dumb, but you can't trick him that way.  Yeah.  Huh?  I don't know.  But I'm telling you, as much as you guys abuse Spaz, he really helps the show when he's  screening the damn phone calls.  Jesus.  He does the job great.  Jesus. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  Tell Stinky to clear the lines.  We're going to give out some tickets here.  I don't friggin' believe him.  We've got some tickets to see the Warped Tour 2000 featuring Green Day, the Mighty Mighty  Boss Tones, and the Long Beach Stub All-Stars at Randall's Island Saturday, July 15th.  Sorry.  Tickets are on sale now through Ticketmaster, but we have a pair for you if you're the 10th  caller.  At 212-757-1027.  There's only one other thing to do today, and that is play What Do We Learn on the Opie 
[00:16:30]  and Anthony Show today.  Stay there.  Please.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  All right, Ed.  Time to put an end to this mess.  Last break of the day.  It's the ONA Show.  212-757-1027.  Time to play.  We're going to put this show out of its misery in eight minutes, and then down to mic your  necks.  Yeah.  212-757-1027.  Time to play. 
[00:17:00]  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today?  Hey, a bunch of them coming in, Ed.  Bill Clinton from Washington.  Oh.  I learned your show today was more boring than Al Gore.  Ouch.  Ben from New York.  I think Superfly has been stung by the giant mosquito.  Ben also learned that Superfly can't read.  Ow.  John writes on the Instant Feedback, I learned today that when the show sucks, bring in an  accountant to start things up.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  The accountant.  Oh, yeah.  Jonas was pretty cool, though.  Yeah, but I mean...  He made Tax Talk pretty interesting.  Yeah.  You know, like, he is an accountant.  I know.  And we'd rather have nudity.  Of course.  All right, let's go to John.  Hey, John, what did you learn on the show today?  Guys, I learned that Snooker is two chair shots away from Ronald Reagan.  All right, burn in hell, Ass Wrangler. 
[00:18:00]  All right, bye.  Ass Wrangler.  Whatever, I don't even...  All right, DJ, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  I learned that you guys shouldn't even bother getting on the air tomorrow because you'll  be competing against the radio icon of Two for Tuesday.  Very true.  Yeah, we'll give them another plug.  Q104 has decided to do Two for Tuesday.  Also, guys, did you hear about the new PlayStation?  Yes, I did.  About what happened with it?  Yeah.  Well, they're not allowing it out of Japan? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And the reason again?  They say it's something because they could use it in a word chip because they can make  missiles lock onto visual targets then.  Yeah, the graphics chip that's in it?  Yeah.  They can use it in a missile to identify targets.  And one more thing I learned.  I learned you guys are the king of radio tees because I sat here all day waiting for Psycho  Mark outtakes.  Oh, we did...  Your savior talked about how boring it is to bring in an accountant.  You obviously have the drunk bastard all ready to go.  All right, where is the Psycho Mark outtake?  We'll just throw it in real fast.  Is it an outtake? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, it's the outtakes, but we want to compare it with his new drug commercial.  That's when it's funny, but the problem was we couldn't find the new drug commercial.  All right, awesome, guys.  All right, but we'll play it right now, DJ.  Cool, thanks a lot.  All right, here it is, matter of fact.  We've got Psycho Mark outtakes.  He has the smoothest voice when he's completely sober.  He does a lot of the commercials that you hear on WNAW.  He does a drug commercial where he's very, very convincing.  Do we have the other drug commercial, at least? 
[00:19:30]  Is that one of them?  I want the one where he tells parents how to tell if their kids are stoned.  I know, that's the best one.  That was the one we wanted to play today.  You can't find it?  No, but I think we've got Psycho Mark doing a drug read here, I believe.  In order for you to help your children resist the pressure to use drugs,  you must remember that your children need positive role models.  Positive role models will help your children gain healthy habits and attitudes.  The examples you set will help children resist pressures to use drugs,  pressures they receive from television, movies, and perhaps their friends. 
[00:20:00]  Drug abuse is a complex issue, and by addressing all the potential causes,  we can come closer to a total prevention.  This important message is sponsored by the concerned pilots and professional staff  with Accel Air Service in Ronkonkoma.  All right, look at that.  You hear how smooth he sounds?  Very smooth.  Nice and sober during the day, right?  Yeah, that smoothness from all the marijuana smoke.  Doing a drug ad?  Yeah.  And now here's that same person at 2 in the morning when he stops by the station after night out. 
[00:20:30]  Here's the community...  Mudslides on TV here in the Discovery Channel.  This is a great girl.  I was just watching mudslides and trying to read Pappy at the same time.  Here's the community calendar on 1027 WNEW.  You may have what it takes to cure someone of blindness.  Pledge to be an eye donor, and you may someone leave the gift of sight.  You may somehow leave the gift of sight.  You may have someone...  It's a f***ing torture.  Absolutely torture. 
[00:21:00]  Torture!  It's torture!  Que-que-que-que-que-que-que-que.  Creepy cow!  Do that bell!  Holy f***!  You may end up giving someone the eyesight.  You may end up giving...  The best is the contrast.  Psycho Mark during the day?  In order for you to help your children resist the pressure to use drugs,  you must remember that your children need positive role models.  Positive role models will help your children gain healthy habits.  Like mine. 
[00:21:30]  All right?  And now, same person, two in the morning.  Here's the community.  Carl, please.  Did you want me to read this?  I can't, I can't read this.  I can't read this. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, it's hot.  We're running hot.  What a mess.  I love that one.  Oh, it's funny.  Hot, we're running hot.  We're running hot.  I know it's overkill, but I've got to do it one more time because it's too good.  A sober cycle, Mark, at two in the afternoon.  In order for you to help your children resist the pressure to use drugs,  you must remember that your children need positive role models.  Positive role models will help your children gain healthy habits and attitudes. 
[00:22:30]  And attitudes.  Okay.  Same person, 2 a.m.  Here's a geeky.  Here's a geeky.  Mudslides on TV here in the discussion.  Here's a geeky.  This is a great girl.  It's like watching mudslides and trying to read copy at the same time.  Here's the community calendar on 1027 WNEW.  You may have what it takes to cure someone of blindness.  Place to be an eye donor, and you may someone leave the gift of sight.  You may someone leave the gift of sight.  I'm kidding. 
[00:23:00]  You may someone.  This is torture.  Absolutely torture.  Torture!  It's torture!  Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get.  Fippy, cowboy, NFL.  Holy f***.  And you may someone leave the gift of sight.  I love that.  And you may someone leave the gift of sight.  It was St. Patrick's Day.  Get, get, get.  What more can I say?  Torture!  Evident torture!  Torture!  Tort, tort, tort, tort, tort.  I love it. 
[00:23:30]  Dan from the city.  Today I learned that Opie can play a foreigner song with the best of them.  Yeah.  Dan from Long F'n Island.  I learned that I was better off doing bong hits.  Listening to Bob Buckman and Superfly jumping from that top rope.  I learned that Superfly should enter the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  That's pretty good.  Steve from Connecticut.  I learned that stuck in an oven with Jews is almost as offensive  as seeing Louie Anderson's pudding.  Javi, put it!  Max from Jersey. 
[00:24:00]  I learned that Psycho Mark is a druggie.  That's great.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, you're next on the radio show.  What I learned today, what I learned today was Muhammad Ali wasn't the only one who left  the ring with too many punches to the head.  Oh, my God, dude.  He sounded like Alzheimer's.  He sounded like Ronald Reagan on marijuana, dude.  One, oh.  He couldn't say it, dude.  It was horrible.  It was horrible.  I loved him as a wrestler, dude.  Ant and I looked at each other two minutes into that and went, uh-oh.  Oh, boy. 
[00:24:30]  Oh.  You're listening to...  Well, Opie and Anthony on, uh, one-oh.  Oh, what is this?  Opie and Anthony on W-O-N-1-0.72.  Opie and Anthony on W-O-N-1-2, you're listening to Nancy and George Bush, Mr. Gorbachev 1078. 
[00:25:00]  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Okay.  What a day.  What a day.  Well, uh, Jimmy Superfly Snooker appearing this Thursday at Skaters World in Wayne, New Jersey.  He's part of the whole CWF thing that's going to be happening there.  He's going to be wrestling Tony Atlas.  I want to thank Johnny Thunder, the CWF champion, for coming in.  Not to be confused with Johnny Action.  That's right.  Also, before we go, uh, if you're having a problem, uh, with your taxes, wow, Jonas Bowen, 
[00:25:30]  he's had over 2,000 phone calls already?  I thought everyone gave up on us today.  Man, you guys are faithful.  We appreciate that.  I like that.  I'm going to buy you all a beer someday.  Wow.  If they needed something else to do, then listen to our show.  Dial up his phone.  Over 2,000 calls today.
