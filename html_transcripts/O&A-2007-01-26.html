<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with typical chaotic banter, rife with sexually suggestive and offensive language. This quickly transitioned into a discussion about the unusually cold weather, with the hosts jokingly declaring Maine a part of Canada.  This led to a comparison of Canada's climate and perceived societal pace, followed by a recounting of a street altercation Opie witnessed, focusing on the arrested individuals’ shivering discomfort in the frigid temperatures.  A caller's story about changing clothes due to the cold weather forecast sparked a discussion about women's winter attire and perceptions of toughness.  A Maine caller followed, prompting a discussion about moose sightings as an indicator of proximity to Canada, and further temperature-based jokes and tangents.  Guest Rich Voss joined the show, detailing his newfound addiction to Priceline, comparing it to gambling, and this led to further off-color jokes, including references to prison rape and a graphic account of his first sexual encounter.  Voss also promoted his upcoming performance at a Quakertown, Pennsylvania firehouse, which sparked a discussion amongst the hosts and callers regarding the town and venue choice.  Teasers for upcoming segments, including “So Your Pussy’s Got Talent” and a segment featuring Goldie Hawn, were interspersed with discussions of Opie’s restaurant, F.H. Riley’s, and an upcoming event there.  A review of *Rocky Balboa* and a discussion of American Idol were further tangents throughout this section of the show.

A significant portion of the show then focused on American Idol auditions. The hosts dissected several audition clips, with particular attention given to Sarah Goldberg's emotional breakdown, leading to commentary on her mental state (with suggestions of bipolar disorder) and her father's apparent lack of support.  Another contestant's tears over her father's lack of pride were also dissected. The hosts provided extensive, often crude and offensive, commentary on the contestants' appearances and mental states, including the use of derogatory terms for people with disabilities.  A critique of American Idol’s editing, suggesting manipulation for dramatic effect, followed, along with a discussion of other reality TV shows such as *I Love New York*.  Rich Voss, filling in for James Norton, remained in studio and participated in this section, promoting his upcoming gigs.  A caller, Teresa, expressed her enjoyment of the show, encouraging further offensive humor. The segment concluded with another discussion of Sarah Goldberg’s audition and a phone call with her seemingly indifferent father, alongside a brief mention of a news story warning against eating squirrels near a toxic waste dump in New Jersey.

The next segment detailed two separate attempts at a radio bit involving cooking and serving a rat to studio guests. The first, with chef Frenchy, resulted in a well-prepared and enthusiastically consumed dish; the second, with an amateur chef, ended disastrously, with descriptions of the rat's inhumane death, poor preparation, and resulting vomiting among those present. The triggering of a smoke alarm was also mentioned. Photos from both events were mentioned as being re-posted online. This was followed by a series of anecdotes from Rich Voss detailing his difficult childhood marked by his parents’ divorce, his father’s erratic behavior, his mother’s manipulative actions, and subsequent emotional struggles.  These accounts included descriptions of physical and emotional abuse and neglect, contrasted with his cousins' more functional family lives.  A Cher song about divorce, which had made Voss cry as a child, was played. This segment also briefly touched upon future show segments, including “Your Blank’s Got Talent,” the planned “squirrel eating” segment (discussing sourcing squirrels from breeders and their suitability for cooking), and a listener call about a fire department’s delayed response to a fire. A humorous misunderstanding involving Craig and Pat Duffy concluded this section.

The subsequent portion of the show revolved around a “blaze of glory” exit plan involving squirrel-based culinary experiments, a discussion about the changing technological landscape (Blockbuster's demise, the iPod, and early digital movie downloads), and extensive brainstorming for "So Your Pussy's Got Talent," a contest featuring sexually explicit and absurd uses of a female participant's vagina. Laszlo was in studio, contributing to the technology discussion and promoting his show. The hosts revealed details of their new "Money Snatch" contest, involving naked women and money, and numerous off-color jokes and graphic descriptions were prevalent.  A running gag involved increasingly outrageous ideas for the "So Your Pussy's Got Talent" contest, with contributions from various staff members, including Danny.  This section concluded with further discussion of technological advancements and the entertainment industry's adaptation to the digital age, interspersed with vulgar jokes and comments, and a recurring subplot involving Anthony’s dislike of blueberries.

The show then shifted to a discussion on the changing landscape of television advertising and its challenges in the digital age.  The hosts discussed advertisers' struggles to adapt to DVRs and on-demand content, exploring solutions such as subliminal messaging, increased product placement in video games, and the potential use of nudity in commercials. The conversation covered on-demand entertainment's effects on advertising revenue, new business models, and the technological arms race between ad-skipping and anti-ad-skipping technologies.  The segment included anecdotes about pop culture and technology, covering topics such as free over-the-air television via USB devices, mobile phone betting on horse races, glitches in casino slot machines, the Slingbox, Grand Theft Auto, and the hosts' experiences with various technologies. This section also included recurring bits and calls, such as the “Line of the Day,” a "100 grand bar" prank call, a re-airing of Anthony’s “Electric Shock OJ” song parody, and a performance by John Malby.  E-Rock was mentioned throughout, along with several other individuals contributing to the discussions and jokes.

The final segment focused on Anthony's paranoia about being followed by helicopters hired by terrestrial radio, detailing elaborate escapades involving his limo, trips to the Hamptons, and betting at a polo match. Artie's involvement in "stirring the sauce" and Robin's show prep struggles, including flushing old tapes down the toilet, were mentioned. The hosts discussed their online presence, fanandsam.com, featuring content like "Pits' coloring book drawings" and podcasts of their early shows.  Derek and Danny's graffiti art ("cunt" and "cock lover") and a future "vagina day" contestant with a large penis were also discussed.  A listener's request led to the playing of Anthony's sexually suggestive song about Marsha Brady.  The show concluded with plugs for upcoming events, including Jim Norton’s stand-up show and Danny's musical adventure hour, further discussions of online content and the comics section of the newspaper (including humorous anecdotes about Marmaduke, Beetle Bailey, and Herman), and a brief, unclear exchange between the hosts possibly relating to website ownership.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure, the most annoying thing on two legs, what a whore fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn, aren't we dumb, hee hee, oh do you want to play, Anthony, I will beat children about the head, Jim Norton, I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore, it's indescribable, I'm trying, it's like a rape that's covered by insurance, some of the comments they make are uncalled for, why are you crying, the virus finally  hit him, but with Jimmy you never know, it could be AIDS, no, yes, yes, it's the O.B. and Anthony's show, the virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of AIDS, I hate you, but enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road. 
[00:00:30]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[00:01:00]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Nothing more fun to start off a Friday than a new steve drop.  Ha ha!  Exactly.  Ah, good morning.  You're about to check out the O.B. and Anthony's show.  From coast to coast.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:01:30]  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down slut.  It is not a sin to get rid of a dirty stain.  Wasting your time with a black.  The Negro.  The Negro.  All right, let's get the phone number out of the way.  1-866-313-FREAK.  That's 1-866-313-FREAK. 
[00:02:00]  Yesterday, we started the show talking about global warming.  Yeah.  Enough about global warming.  Until the next time, it's 60 or 70 in December, okay?  It's over.  It's over.  Time to, like, you know, just put the global warming discussion on the back burner for a while.  Too cold.  Because I ain't listening to anybody about global warming today.  And I don't want to hear from cities that are colder.  Because, like I said, once it reaches a certain point, it's just cold. 
[00:02:30]  And it kills you faster.  But it feels the same.  You know what?  Just one morning, though, I want to say that we're broadcasting from the coldest city in America.  We never quite get there.  That'd be rough.  That'd be rough.  We never quite get there.  Well, because, Opie, it would be an Arctic front moving down.  And we would be at the south end of that Arctic front.  So anything north of us would be even colder.  Like Maine.  There's no degrees in Maine. 
[00:03:00]  Ever.  Certain cities in Maine today, there's no degrees.  How do you know?  Boston, our buddies in Boston.  I listen to the radio on the way in.  I listen to news.  News radio.  What's that?  10-10 wins in New York.  What's news?  All news.  All the time.  Give us 22 minutes.  We'll give you the world.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And they still have the teletype sound effect in the background.  Yeah.  It's like just a digital.  Like in the old, old days, it's an old news station.  It's been featured in a lot of movies and stuff, Goodfellas, that scene where he's 
[00:03:30]  in the shower and finds out that the robbery went over at the airport, the Lufthansa heist,  and he's listening to winds.  And he's...  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And then you hear...  And I guess in the old days, there was a real teletype machine, you know, that they'd  tear off the news from.  But now they just use like this digital thing.  Yeah, it's all just on a computer.  And our old boss...  No noise, really.  Our old boss from N.E.W. used to run the place.  And one day they decided, let's just get rid of the teletype thing. 
[00:04:00]  And people freaked out.  They basically wanted to modernize their gas station.  Yeah, but they lost their mind and were like, we need the teletype.  I don't know when they're talking about the news.  So they had to bring back the teletype.  Yeah, they brought back the teletype.  But I heard it on the news that it's, I think, five in Boston, five degrees.  Yeah, that's what I was about to say.  Here in New York City, it's nine.  Yeah, nine.  And I'm thinking as we're coming into work today, we've got a chance at being the coldest city in America. 
[00:04:30]  No way.  As far as the ones we broadcast to.  What if the Arctic wind starts in Westchester?  So it could pretty much start.  And that didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't.  They had that in Canada on the Canadian 1010.  It's almost the same thing.  Yeah, but they're still using teletype up there.  So it makes sense, Rich.  In America, we don't use the teletype.  The Canadians are behind us.  It's too cold for them to actually try to move forward in their society. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Why invent new things?  It's too cold today.  It's too cold today.  I'm just going to go curling with my friends.  That cold weather has thrown them, I don't know, 35 years behind us.  I mean, it adds up after a while.  When you sit at home because it's minus 80 degrees in your city, you take a day or two off here and there, and it adds up over time.  They're 35 years behind America.  It'll be their police force.  Think about it.  Still wears those funny cowboy type hats, and they ride horses. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And wear red suits.  We stopped killing engines years ago.  They're still shooting Indians on the plains.  They're still killing Indians and shooting buffalo.  Right.  Because it's cold.  Army on horses.  Yeah.  We're being attacked by the Renaissance Festival.  Yeah, they pull cannons behind them on horseback.  Stupid Canada.  Even the Canadians agree.  They're like, well, one married me.  I know.  That's true.  Exactly. 
[00:06:00]  Stupid Canadians.  Drive the point home.  New York is nine degrees.  Yeah, nine.  Feels like minus eight.  It just feels like whatever.  Enough with the wind chill.  Just give me the temperature.  They give the exact wind chill.  What is the temperature?  That's all I need to know, and I'll figure it out in my own little world.  Yeah, if they say it's nine degrees and we're having gusts of wind up to 35 miles an hour outside,  I don't need to know what the exact wind chill's going to be.  You just know it's really, really bad when you go outside, like unbreathable. 
[00:06:30]  That's the thing I can't stand.  You can't breathe.  It just freezes everything.  If your teeth get cold, it's your teeth, and when you breathe, it feels like you have asthma, it's cold.  Very cold.  And then everything hurts when you go inside.  Your inner ear hurts if those weren't covered up.  Yeah, your teeth hurt.  Your nose is just like a faucet, just snot pouring out of everyone's face.  Yeah, yeah.  Colder than New York.  And by the way, we do broadcast to Maine. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  As far as this show is concerned, Maine is part of Canada.  You don't get to play in our little which city is the coldest because you're going to win every time.  So for now on, you are part of Canada.  You're not considering them part of the United States.  No.  49 states in our grand union.  That's right.  As far as the Opie and Anthony show goes, we have decided Maine is now part of Canada.  All right?  Yeah, look.  Wait, go back there.  Maine, minus two.  And that's no wind chill. 
[00:07:30]  No, that's their temperature today.  The real temperature.  See, Maine doesn't count anymore.  You're part of Canada.  They owe two degrees.  Yes.  They're two degrees in debt.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Effing show-offs.  Last night, walking down the street, as cold as it was, these two guys were handcuffed with their faces on the sidewalk.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I mean, they're going, there can't be any worse.  When you have handcuffs on you, you know your day is ruined.  Yeah.  And their face and bodies were on the cold sidewalk with, like, three cops kneeling on them each. 
[00:08:00]  And just their lives were over, at least.  What did they do?  I think they got in a fight or in a bar and started a bubble.  And it was, like, six cop cars.  And all we kept thinking of was, oh, how cold are they?  Yeah, that must be really cold.  Forget about what they did.  You know how miserable that's got to be?  The handcuffs, you know, are extra tight.  And they're cold, too.  Cold on top of that.  And if you go to jail, you can't be really a punk and start off by going, I'm cold.  Yeah.  Let me just warm up before you give me my rape.  Right. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  Go back there.  So I guess we've got to give it to Boston and Buffalo today so far.  Colder than New York City.  What about Chicago?  Yeah, come on.  Chicago's got to be up there.  Buffalo is four degrees right now.  And Boston's four degrees right now.  All depends on, I think, where that low came in from Canada.  Oh, that'll hurt you.  Yeah.  And we're trying to get, what?  Chicago's 22? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, see, it moved off to the east.  That's why.  They were getting cold.  And now we got it.  And then it's got to move.  Get out of the way.  We're colder than Chicago today?  Yeah.  That's pretty interesting.  We're the Windy City.  Not really.  It's really not interesting.  It's stupid weather.  I get it.  We should move on.  Of course.  Just got to comment on it because it's just a thing that has to be dealt with and you're  angered by it.  I'm just angered by the cold.  I try to tell Anthony, though, we're only getting one day here in New York. 
[00:09:30]  One day too many.  I remember my days in Buffalo.  It was day after day after day after day.  Just would not end.  Don't make me bring up prison rape again.  Yes.  Because I will.  If you're doing a stint in prison, let's say you got six months to do.  Right.  And you only get raped in the shower once.  Right.  Isn't that one time too many?  So I don't care if it's one cold day out of the year.  I can't deal with it well.  Because now you had that rape and five months and 29 days of not taking a shower. 
[00:10:00]  Just be filthy.  No way.  Are we giving it to Syracuse out of nowhere?  Syracuse.  We do broadcast there.  I've heard rumor.  Wow.  And what is the temperature in Syracuse?  Zero.  They are out of degrees.  They plum run out.  95X.  Zero degrees. 
[00:10:30]  Zero point zero.  And remember, Maine, sorry.  You're part of Canada now.  That minus two doesn't count.  Doesn't count.  As far as the Opie and Anthony show goes.  All right.  Let's go to somebody from Long Beach.  What's your name, sir?  Eitan.  Eitan.  What's up?  Eitan.  What's up, guys?  Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know I was watching Fox 5 on the way out to work this  morning.  And, of course, they were telling people to be scared out of their minds about the cold.  Walking to work, you might get hypothermia.  Yeah, they like to scare you when it gets either really cold or really hot on the news. 
[00:11:00]  And they give you little pointers on how to dress.  Like, I was, you know, I had pulled out a nice little outfit today, an ensemble that  I was going to wear that consisted of a little short-sleeved T-shirt.  And a skirt.  And, yeah, a skirt.  I was going to wear a skirt today.  And F me, pumps.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  But I, thank God I heard the news.  And I would have been dead 50 yards from my house in this temperature. 
[00:11:30]  So I decided on the long pants, long johns, and thermal shirt, and pullover.  Let me tell you something.  You know, morons.  We think we're, like, we're, we think we're men.  We think we're a man's man.  A man's man.  We think we're tough.  And could take anything, right?  These, whoa, I almost said it.  These females are nuts.  Yeah.  We'll do, we'll be doing the walkover to XM later. 
[00:12:00]  I guarantee we'll see women walking to work in skirts.  In some type of skirt.  They are nuts.  How do they, how do they pull that off in the middle of the winter?  I've asked that of women.  I don't get it.  What are you doing?  You're wearing, like, a skirt.  And it's freezing cold out.  And they go, no, I'm wearing stockings.  Yeah, some of them are stockings.  That micro-thin material that's pretty much just a little netting over your legs.  Ooh, brr. 
[00:12:30]  Don't get overheated.  Stockings.  I got underwear on.  I got sweatpants under here.  I didn't even go with the long johns.  I'm like, I need something even thicker.  You kept your pajamas on, OBJ?  Basically, yeah.  Basically.  Like a fleece, like a sweat pant slash pajama.  You're kind of right, actually.  And then I decided to go with my thickest jeans I own.  And I'm still cold.  And we'll see these women walking around in skirts and bare legs to work today.  And we think we're tough.  Just to look hot. 
[00:13:00]  Some of them are so cold down there anyhow, they're so used to it.  Oh, that's right.  I see.  Instead of the wind blowing up the skirt in cold air, usually it's just kind of oozing  down their legs.  The frigid old.  Frigid.  Hey, let's talk to our pals in Canada.  It's Todd in Maine.  Oh, Canada.  You have a brand new state.  It's called Maine.  What's up?  No, it's a...  What do they call them?  Provinces?  Province.  All right, we're checking in.  Very provincial. 
[00:13:30]  It's the province of...  It's the province...  Province of Maine.  Province of Maine.  There you go.  What's up, Todd?  Oh, not a lot.  Being glad that I'm part of Canada now, I guess.  Hey.  Hey, you get free health care.  Wait, you don't think you're part of Canada?  Look to your right.  Look to your right.  What do you see?  What do you see?  Canada.  You're just as high.  Do you ever see a moose?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Enough said.  Right there.  Oh, yeah.  The rest of America doesn't see mooses.  We don't see moose. 
[00:14:00]  It doesn't matter how cold it gets down here.  It could get Canada cold down here.  I will never walk outside and see a moose.  You know what?  If your state sees moose, you're part of Canada.  Part of Canada.  So now I'm starting to question northern New Hampshire.  Do you have caribou?  Because I don't even know what you are.  Might even have to take you off Canada if you have caribou and put you somewhere else.  Yeah.  Like Greenland.  Oh, I was going to go with Iceland. 
[00:14:30]  Iceland.  We were leaving Bonnie's house where father and mother goes, be careful driving.  You might hit a moose.  Right.  Hit a moose.  A moose.  You know, a pack of moose.  Hey, it's Rich Voss.  Don't know moose from where I'm from.  Huh?  You don't see many moose from where I am.  Nah.  But you see them occasionally.  Okay.  It doesn't matter.  You see one moose.  You're in Canada.  All right.  So what's up there, Todd?  Oh, not a lot.  Heading to work.  I bet in Mexico City.  That was the call?  That's your call? 
[00:15:00]  That's it.  He just called to tell us he's heading to work.  Couldn't you call your wife and tell her that?  Yeah.  You just gave an idea.  See.  Made it this morning.  See, Canadians are stupid.  Canadians are simple people.  All right, Todd.  We have a simple life.  What can I say?  All right.  Todd's freezing his butt off up there in Maine.  Canada.  Yeah.  Call it Canada.  Which is now part of Canada.  There's never in Mexico City a guy driving around going like, oh, he almost hit the moose.  It's just because it's hot. 
[00:15:30]  You hit like iguanas down there.  But never a moose.  I guess you're never driving either down there.  Oh, that's true.  By the way.  Just sitting there napping with those stupid big hats.  All right.  I think we just spent 20 minutes to tell you it's cold.  Yeah.  Did you get it?  Really accomplishing a lot on the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course we need the dramatic music to start this show.  Dramatic music.  We come on the air.  We tell you it's cold.  It's perfect. 
[00:16:00]  It's perfect.  That intro, you need it.  Gets everyone's attention.  This must be something important.  Listen.  Listen up to them.  Oh, my God.  They gave out temperatures to cities all morning long.  That would be bad.  If we heard this show giving out temperatures, we would goof on the fact that there's a show  out there actually.  Dude, I heard a show yesterday.  It was so bad.  For the first 15 minutes, you know what they did?  You're never going to guess.  They gave out the temperatures of the cities they broadcast from.  What hacks. 
[00:16:30]  What show is that called?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Some cutting edge radio.  Yeah.  And the sad thing is, there are people going skiing today.  It's not even as cold.  They're going to go up to a higher point where it's colder.  Yeah, where it's colder and there's some snow to make them wet.  I love my skiing.  And it was days like this that you had to shut her down and just hang out in the lodge and  just get hammered.  You'll still go skiing?  I have.  I have in single digit temperatures and then with the wind chill and then now going down 
[00:17:00]  the hill really fast.  It was beyond stupid.  It was just beyond stupid.  That is a great atmosphere though for drinking.  Those ski lodges.  You just hang out there and take your shrink.  Take your ski boots off and just put your toes up near the fire.  You get like an 80 foot wide fireplace and just cranking.  They just throw houses in there to burn.  It's like the whole place is toasty warm.  I never leave.  I went skiing when I was doing an Aspen at the festival. 
[00:17:30]  So I skied before.  Boss puts the ass in Aspen.  So I go skiing.  I'm on the top.  I didn't know they took us to where the ski team practices.  Right, right.  So the guy I go with goes on that.  We go on that one on the major slope.  So I get halfway down.  Triple black diamond.  Yeah, I go halfway down.  I look the rest and I panic, right?  And I'm already having an anxiety attack.  I can't breathe, right?  I quit smoking and started the week I was going there.  It was a nightmare.  The ski team had to come and get me or these rescuers and they took me down a back 
[00:18:00]  route and there was a downhill ski race.  They had to stop the race.  Oh, to let your sorry ass down.  To walk me through.  $100 to do half a hill and go to the lodge.  Did a St. Bernard come with a little barrel around his neck to give you some brandy?  I'm clean and sober for 18 years.  Keep the dog away.  But you're going to die, sir.  You're going to die, sir. 
[00:18:30]  I have a new addiction now.  Oh?  Priceline.  It's unbelievable.  All right, we'll get into Rich Vance and his Priceline.  That's a good tease.  Some of that.  Are they a sponsor?  What year is this?  1995?  Really?  I'm in love with Shatner.  The hell?  You are so behind.  Yeah.  You should move to Canada.  You should make friends with Larry King.  You would be cutting edge in Canada.  You hear about this thing?  This Priceline thing?  This Priceline thing?  I got to tell the world about it.  Something like you name your own price. 
[00:19:00]  Never heard of it.  Everybody's known about it.  Dude, I gave up on Priceline probably a decade ago.  But just because you want, this is like gambling.  All right, we'll get into it.  It's like gambling.  You're looking for the best payoff?  All right, we'll get into it.  Vance is on to something.  Also, we want to talk about Goldie Hawn's Poo-Ha this morning.  Yeah, a little discussion in the office about that.  Goldie Hawn's Poo-Ha.  And for everybody in Jersey, they're warning you not to eat something. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah, this is a tease.  Does that have anything to do with the last story you teased?  No?  All right.  I'm just checking.  That's really good.  No, but they lived in Hollywood.  This is probably why we'll never have a black president or a female president, by the way.  If they have to waste space in the paper to tell you not to eat this certain thing, you just know, like, who are they voting for? 
[00:20:00]  Most of America should move to Canada.  They're behind the times.  The Negro.  The Negro.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony.  Wasting your time with a black.  Huh.  Huh.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O and A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Before we move on, we've got to say hi to Courtney.  Hey.  Up there in Buffalo.  What's up, Courtney?  Hi, Courtney.  Not in much.  Not in much.  Getting ready for school.  Okay.  Where do you go to school?  Iroquois.  Oh, really?  Wow.  You know what that is?  No. 
[00:21:00]  Sorry, Indian reservation?  Yeah.  Iroquois.  So why are you calling?  Actually, I do know where it is.  So why are you calling, Courtney?  I listen to you guys every morning.  You guys are just the funniest people.  Oh.  Thanks.  But see, when you call the show, we want you to help us be like even more funny instead  of calling just to tell us we're funny.  Sometimes a compliment is nice.  We don't need compliments.  Courtney, are you in high school or college?  No, I'm in middle school, going to high school. 
[00:21:30]  Middle school.  I got a question.  How old are you?  Like 14?  Yep.  When do kids like start having sex?  Like for real, like in school, middle school, high school.  So when do they, not you, you know, say your friends.  When are they starting?  Everyone's afraid of it anyway, so they're probably not going to start until they're like  50.  Are you serious?  How come my kid has no fear then?  Oh.  All right.  Thanks, Courtney.  Oh, Rich.  You got a slut on your hands? 
[00:22:00]  We can't talk to a 14-year-old about our, uh.  You got to be careful.  But, but, we could talk about your daughters.  No.  Your daughters are banging already?  No, but drinking, partying, drinking.  Oh, that leads right to it.  It does.  You can't tell everybody that drinks.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Tell yourself that.  Think about it, growing up.  Tell yourself that.  Every chick that drank and partied behind their parents' back, they weren't just drinking  and partying.  They were also sexually active.  I had girls that were with me, not sexually, and the fact that they were with me made them 
[00:22:30]  drink, but they didn't drink before.  Like, oh, God, we got to go out.  We're rich tonight.  Yeah.  Make sure there's plenty of booze.  All my friends, like a lot of them, did it, and I never, so I'm with a girl, and she was  16.  I was probably 17.  I'm begging her, please, let's do it, please, or else I'm going to break up with you.  So, Chief, I finally browbeat her, and we went into the woods, right?  And I, you know, I put protection on, not that I knew what it was, and I didn't know  Why is that important to the story?  It's good.  It's good.  Okay, yeah.  And I, she goes, look, I'll do the other thing, you know. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  All right.  We know what the other thing is.  We know what the other thing is, Rich.  Yeah.  And I said, no way.  And then I didn't know how to do it.  I really didn't know, and I couldn't do it.  So I said, can we do the other thing?  She goes, no, you already blew that.  Oh.  It's like I picked the wrong door.  It's like a game show, yeah.  Why are you changing?  No, you passed on it.  Wait, wait.  It's a great story, but why are you changing the subject?  Because your daughters are banging.  No, they're not.  They're good.  Because if they're drinking, they're drinking to take away a little of the shyness. 
[00:23:30]  No, first of all.  So they can get a little braver.  They're that girl in the woods.  No, first of all.  First, they're not.  My daughters, I got good kids, honor roll students.  Every girl.  Oh, honor roll students don't want a little.  I went out with an honor roll girl.  Amazing.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, she drinks, has a couple drinks at a party.  Every kid that drinks isn't banging.  Yeah, they are.  Yeah.  They are.  There's something going on.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  They are.  No.  There's something going on.  Keep telling yourself that.  What about Priceline, Rich?  Oh, that's the best stuff.  It's like, because you put your price in.  Yeah.  I don't want to, you know the rules, and you're sitting here going, it's like action.  It's like going.  Am I going to get it?  Am I going to get it?  I guess we got to explain really fast for the new listeners.  Rich is a very addictive person.  Oh, yeah.  Addictive personality.  And he's gotten rid of the crank that he used to do, and the booze, and the coke, and  the smoking of the crack. 
[00:24:30]  And he also had a gambling addiction.  He got rid of that.  He's working on his smoking addiction.  Yeah.  Which is going pretty well.  Over seven months.  Over seven months.  Really?  That went really fast.  Yeah.  All right.  So now you're into Priceline, something we all were into about 10 years ago.  Yeah, but you were-  Because it feels like you're kind of like getting a little action, a little gambling going on.  You guys were into it because you wanted hotels.  I don't care about the hotels.  I just like knowing I won a hotel.  I won a four-star hotel at $125. 
[00:25:00]  It's like a four-star hotel, they're like $400.  So you won.  I basically won because I put in $100, and you got it.  It's like hitting at the table.  You don't understand.  It's true.  It's the feeling you get.  It's like hitting.  It's like hitting.  It's like hitting.  It's like blackjack.  You're going, and me and Bonnie are leaning over a computer, right?  I'm getting her involved, right?  And she's going, let me do it on mine.  I go, oh, no.  I do the first time in this house.  I got it. 
[00:25:30]  I'm getting to hotels when I don't need them.  There's empty rooms all over the place.  Like in Quakertown this weekend, I think we're going to do, I don't even think they have  a four-star hotel there.  Yeah, I wouldn't think so.  How do you get four-star hotels?  Hold on, hold on.  Rich.  What?  You just make this way too easy.  You're going to be in Quakertown?  Just Saturday.  I'm doing a firehouse.  He's playing at a firehouse.  Dude, for the life of me, I couldn't tell you where Quakertown is. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's below Allentown.  It's in Pennsylvania.  Is it the Amish?  No.  Are you performing at an Amish firehouse?  They're Quakers.  No, it's not an Amish firehouse.  They're Quakers.  They're Quakers?  I don't know.  It's Quakertown.  Nixon was a Quaker, and you know what a sense of humor he had.  Come on.  You do realize you were on network TV, right?  It's a benefit.  Oh, my God.  It's a fundraiser.  So you're going to be at the West End Firehouse in Quakertown, Pennsylvania? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Wow, man.  Holy cow.  Now, what happens if the alarm goes off and you're...  I'm going to get some fire on me.  What happens if you're up on stage, though?  Seriously.  You're up on stage doing your act, and it's like,  Hi, yeah, I owe my daughter money, and I'm dodging her.  I want...  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on. 
[00:27:00]  One minute.  Why is everyone sliding down the pole in front of me?  I'm being heckled by a fire truck.  What if they all have to leave if there's a fire?  Either way, they're going to walk out on me or leave because of the fire.  Someone's going to start a fire just to get out of there.  One of the firemen is just going to light his car on fire.  Wow.  A lot of volunteer firemen start a fire.  You've heard that, right?  Oh, sure.  A lot.  Okay, yeah.  I've heard three or four in 20 years. 
[00:27:30]  Dude, you can't even get a gig in Allentown.  You have to go to Quakertown?  I'd have more respect for you if at least you said you were going to Allentown.  I turned Allentown down.  You are south, slightly east of Allentown.  Yeah.  By what, a half hour or so?  I guess.  All right.  It's like 20 minutes.  I don't know.  So this price line, you're loving it because you're getting cheap hotel rooms?  Well, because you sit there and wait.  And it's like you put it in and it goes, you know, it's going through.  It's checking everything.  And then it goes, try again. 
[00:28:00]  And you're like, oh.  I lost.  I lost.  So now I up my ante.  It's almost like doubling down.  You're upping your ante.  You're going, all right, can I afford this?  You know, will I still win if I hit it on this?  Right.  And then I'll put in like maybe 10 more dollars, you know?  And then I'll go maybe another section in New York.  See, I could do this for over an hour.  Yeah.  It's in like eight sections.  You do one section at one price.  No.  Then you do another section at another price. 
[00:28:30]  So basically all night you're playing.  $75 hotel room, $75 hotel room, $75 hotel, $75.  And stop.  Oh, $250.  So it's great.  I'm going to laugh my ass off.  Your asses.  Well, I do have multiple personalities.  So technically asses would work.  That he goes back to gambling because of Priceline.  Priceline will drive him back to gambling.  We'll start with like online poker. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, it started with Priceline.  And I just got online poker because it's like Priceline only with cards.  And then I'm figuring online poker, why do it online when you can do it in the casino?  Yeah.  And of course, now I'm in the casino.  Why not play?  I got to do the craps.  Shoot craps.  God, there's nothing better.  Throwing them bones.  You like that?  There's nothing more exciting than when a crap table is hot.  You can get like Farrakhan and the head of the Klan high-fiving each other.  You know, when that table is so much love. 
[00:29:30]  Camaraderie.  When you're with the money, people like don't care.  You're like.  That's what brings people together.  Come on, Adolph.  Hit a seven.  That is funny because it is absolutely true.  When a table's hot, when a crap table's hot, anything, you're sitting at a blackjack table  and the dealer's doing nothing but busting.  Everyone's high-fiving.  Yeah.  Oh, but when that table's cold, everyone's an ass.  I curse and I hit.  Like I'm not a good loser. 
[00:30:00]  And one time I just.  You're a great loser, Rich.  Who's a good loser?  Ask anybody.  Well, people can do it without getting vocal or verbal.  I smashed the table.  But one time I threw my hands up.  I go, damn, threw my hands up.  And right behind me was a waitress full of a tray of drinks.  Oh, boy.  And that went flying.  You're the guy they have to reprimand every so often because I see these guys at the tables  and they're cursing and the dealer's like, excuse me, that language isn't permitted.  Yeah.  Oh, well, you took my money.  Yeah.  What the ****? 
[00:30:30]  You took my **** money, but I can't **** say a few **** words about the **** situation?  They care about cursing.  And, you know, you're sitting there gambling, drinking.  You know, it's like Satan's basement anyhow.  You know, here in hell.  Yeah.  We like to keep a little morality and civility here.  Stop with the cursing.  Well, I figure since I quit smoking, I really would like to go shoot dice, you know, maybe  one time just to have it.  So would we.  Oh, I thought you meant the comic.  Hey, Lead Belly, the firefighters are going to walk out on Voss for a cat stuck in a tree. 
[00:31:00]  How funny would that be?  By the way, yeah, Quaker Town's a half hour outside of Philly, so we've got a lot of people  that will support you that are listening on WISP right now, Rich.  Oh, yeah.  Make some oatmeal box jokes.  They'll go over well there.  Hey, by the way, so you just discovered Priceline?  Well, yeah.  Rich just handed me a list of other things he has just discovered.  Oh, okay. 
[00:31:30]  He just discovered PlayStation, Nintendo 64, the portable CD player, DVDs in general.  Wow, you're up to DVDs.  Napster, the Yahoo search engine, eBay, cell phones.  Oh, wait, I got to tell you about eBay.  He just watched that new movie, Independence Day.  He's listening to this new artist, Alanis Morissette.  He just found out about the O.J. verdict.  Clinton has been reelected.  The Olympics, you're looking forward to that. 
[00:32:00]  It's going to be in Atlanta.  Tupac was shot in Vegas.  Yes, we'll talk about that today, Rich, of course.  And he's really digging this new TV show, Friends.  Wow.  I think it's going to be big.  That's also a list of things that came out right around the time everyone was checking  out Priceline, by the way, Rich.  I got kicked off of eBay.  Kicked off?  The biggest option.  For buying or selling?  For saying I was going to buy, and I didn't.  You know, when you make a commitment.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You got to buy it. 
[00:32:30]  When you say you're going to buy, it's a commitment, and if you back out, blah, blah,  blah.  And these little babies snitch on you.  They write a bad report.  Babies?  It's somebody that was trying to sell something, and they thought it was sold.  Yeah, ass.  And maybe five other people were going to buy it.  Yeah, you're not getting sympathy from us.  We did a ... I know it's rare, but every once in a while, we do something very nice for  people, the Opie and Anthony show.  We were selling cocaine on ... No, we did a charity auction.  We did a charity auction for the victims of Katrina.  Katrina, before we realized they were all crooks just stealing federal money. 
[00:33:00]  Right, right.  And we collect things throughout the year.  We didn't do it this year.  We were going to do another charity auction, but we said, you know what?  No one is really in need this year.  Who's in need?  No one.  We're going to a firehouse.  Everyone's fine.  So we'll keep all this ...  I wish boss benefit.  So we'll keep all this great stuff that's autographed by celebrities to ourselves this year.  We're the charity this year.  But we did do it.  And people would bid ridiculously high on a bunch of these items, and we were really, really 
[00:33:30]  excited, because we did want to give a nice big chunk of money ...  Let them touch it.  To ...  Some money.  We went to New Orleans, and a bunch of people, like, didn't pay up.  That's not the case.  The case is ... I did want to buy ... It was two golf clubs twice, but something was wrong  with my PayPal, and I didn't know how to fix it, so I just moved on.  Okay?  There was something ... There was a reason I couldn't do it.  Maybe ... I think I spent too much over my limit.  You didn't go do that new thing, a money order? 
[00:34:00]  Whatever.  Go to the bank.  Did you wire Western Union?  So, I got kicked off.  Is this thing, Western Union?  You could actually wire money.  I don't know how they get the bills through the wire.  Rich is lucky.  He comes in here, and he feels like he's taking a look into the future.  Yeah.  This is the future, Rich.  This is some of the things you're going to look forward to in 10 years from now.  Flatscreen TV.  Oh, he's been looking at my monitor, wondering, why is the back so short? 
[00:34:30]  This is the future.  You're one of the lucky people out there that get a glimpse into the future.  I keep it simple.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Keep it simple.  Look how small cell phones are going to be one day, Rich, for you.  In 10 years, Rich.  In 10 years, it'll be how it is.  You'll have something like this.  When everyone's talking with a chip in their head, you'll be walking around with a cell phone,  and people will be looking like, what the hell is he holding?  And this is called a BlackBerry.  You could actually get your email on it.  Don't mistake it for the fruit and try to eat it.  It just has a similar name.  Don't get too excited. 
[00:35:00]  You still have 10 years to go before you get this, baby.  And that's an old one.  If I had my typewriter here, I would definitely.  Typewriter.  It's like Mickey Spillane writing his act.  Typewriter.  Boss, you never disappoint.  Oh, that's great.  I got to talk about Priceline.  What?  New thing.  Priceline?  I don't understand.  We have a new client coming on board.  It's what?  Hotels.com.  Hotels.com.  Oh, I've been there.  I've been there, too. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Let's say hi, Chris in Quakertown.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, not much.  Quakertown?  Rich Voss should not come here.  This place sucks.  It's lower than low.  I'm not moving there.  I'm doing an hour gig.  He's doing a gig and a barn raising.  Have fun with that, because you're going to be surrounded by rednecks.  Why are you living in Quakertown, then?  Because I moved in with my girlfriend.  I'm an idiot.  Oh, God.  Where were you living before, my friend?  That must be some good pooh-ha. 
[00:36:00]  I'm originally from South Jersey.  I moved up here when I was like 18 to a town that's even more hickey.  It's called Ever Black Eddie.  That's even more out in the middle of nowhere.  Oh, and then you moved because your girlfriend.  What kind of job can you get in Quakertown?  I work in hotels, so I got to do it.  No, no, no, no.  We don't care what you do.  You're following her, so why did she have to move to Quakertown?  She lived here her whole life.  Oh.  What does she do?  She works at a factory.  In a factory.  And what did you do before you moved to Quakertown? 
[00:36:30]  I worked in hotels.  In hotels.  So why don't you guys move to the metropolis of Allentown?  Yeah.  It's right there.  Yeah.  That's not really an improvement either.  No.  No?  No, there's a lot of trouble in Allentown, isn't there?  And then whenever you say where you're from, you got to have some ass, make the stupid  Billy Joel song joke.  Living here in Allentown.  Oh, I never heard that one.  Dook, dook, dook.  Thanks, Billy.  Is your girlfriend a hottie?  Was she worth moving for?  Yeah.  Worth moving to Quakertown for?  Wow. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  Supermodel.  Are you going to go see Rich Voss at, wow, usually I know the names of the comedy clubs.  Usually it's no problem.  I've said Carolines a million times.  I've said a stress mag for a million times.  Plenty of it.  Next month I have to go to some real gigs.  I've said the comedy seller a million times.  Zanies.  The Chuckle Hut.  Let me add this one to the list.  The West End Firehouse.  And then we're doing the after party at the Volunteer Rescue Squad after it. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You live there, pal.  All right.  Voss is getting paid to go there.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Are you?  Let's go to Bob in New York.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, nice show, guys.  Rich, it's not like Priceline's a gambling fix.  You're trying to chew them down on the computer.  Well, basically.  Trying to get a good deal.  Yeah, of course you are.  Let's say hi to Doug in Jersey.  What's up, Doug?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, I just want to know if Voss brought in his purse this morning.  I got a new one. 
[00:38:00]  He did get a new one.  The new one looks just like the old one.  It looks like the old one.  It's a little smaller.  Except it doesn't have the little saddle.  It's a little smaller.  It doesn't have the saddle bags on the side.  This is where you're wrong.  I'm not going through this again today because I took, after I left here that day, I returned.  This is a messenger bag.  Messenger bags aren't gay.  All right?  I've only seen gay guys walk around with those things.  Well, let me tell you something.  The message is homo.  It's the message you're throwing off with the message bag.  You're sending a clear message.  Every time I walk back in a Louis Vuitton store, what did O&A do to you? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, what did they do?  You're bringing it back?  No, not this.  Look, because then you're defending us by going on the website and showing us men's bags that you could get at Louis Vuitton, right?  Yeah.  The average guy, and I'm probably talking about 99% of the people listening to us right now, would not carry a bag like that.  I don't care if it says a men's bag.  Like, you can't even write on it, this is a men's bag, and people would still call you, you know. 
[00:39:00]  You know what?  I like the fact that last time Rich came in with that big Louis Vuitton, it was a huge woman's purse.  It was a big pocketbook thing.  But we went to the website.  Yeah.  And you were so paranoid by us goofing on it that you immediately ran there and got a new bag.  But that bag that you had, we didn't bring this up on the air.  When we looked it up, it was under men's bag.  Oh, yeah.  It was a racket.  It's a men's bag.  But you get so paranoid from everybody goofing on you, you had to get rid of us. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Not only did I get rid of it, I didn't sleep the night before I came in here.  I got home from here, and we have to go to the mall.  I got to get rid of this thing.  Well, because everybody was going gay bag.  Yeah.  And calling.  My kids were being tormented in school.  You know, your daddy's got a gay bag and stuff.  That one's not much better.  No, that's not much better.  Guys just don't carry around bags like that.  Yeah, they do.  How many guys do you see?  I swear to God, Rich, I'm not even trying to like, you know.  It's so easy to mess with you, but this one is more reality than anything. 
[00:40:00]  I've never seen another man carry a bag like that.  A messenger bag.  You've never seen that.  A messenger bag?  Maybe a plain messenger bag.  He rocks China, defend himself with a friggin' six-year-old's backpack.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Enough about the bag.  Let's go to Happy Camper.  He's calling from Pal Talk.  What's up, Happy Camper?  Yo, what's going on, man?  Morning.  Morning to you, Zal.  All right.  Morning.  Hey, look, if you pull up my camera, I'm driving through Quakertown, and right about this 
[00:40:30]  traffic light, right here.  Okay.  So for all the people that got Pal Talk, you could actually see how awful Quakertown is?  Pretty much, yeah.  I just pulled my screen up, and there it is.  I'm in downtown Quakertown.  Oh.  Geez.  Coming over to the top.  Wow.  You're coming over by the traffic light, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Can't miss it there.  All right.  Well, thanks for a little look.  Wait, which dude?  He's a Happy Camper.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, I'm trying to get his camera. 
[00:41:00]  Uh, what do you see in, uh, downtown Quakertown?  Nothing.  Uh, well, there's a deer crossing sign, speed limit.  It's an upcoming car.  Oncoming car.  Oh, dude.  Do us a favor.  We're just, just right into the oncoming traffic.  Let's make radio history.  Look, this car coming right now.  Come on.  You want to do it?  Just turn left right now.  Oh.  Hey, man.  How about this lake?  See this lake right here?  Should I jump in the lake?  Oh, dude.  I would laugh my ass.  Yeah, yeah.  Turn into the lake.  All right.  It's going over some kind of weird bridge. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, can I fit right into the lake?  Come on.  You'll make history.  Just take a turn right into that.  This is irresponsible radio.  He's riding the shoulder a little too close.  On the guardrail.  Come on.  At least make it look close for us.  I don't have the balls.  Crazy?  And don't drink any of the water.  No, no.  I don't have the, I don't have the, the, the, the backbone to do it.  All right.  Oh, good.  Thank you, happy camper.  Rich, a lot of people commenting, saying that at the firehouse, be careful because when 
[00:42:00]  you run long, they don't put a little red light on you.  They hose you off the stage.  They actually take the firehouse and launch you off the stage.  You, you feel like you're black and it's the sixties.  Yeah.  By the way, uh, Rich on a stage, unbelievable.  So check it out at the West End Firehouse in Quakertown tonight in Pennsylvania.  No, tomorrow, Saturday.  Oh, Saturday night.  Saturday night.  Saturday night with Rich Voss.  Okay.  So tonight is the ritual, uh, witch burning that they have there.  Right, right. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, what are you following?  What's that?  What's the big event at the, uh, West End Firehouse?  Human sacrifice for some small town thing that's been going on for a hundred years?  I don't know.  We must kill a child every month at the full moon.  It's the lamb blood drinking contest tonight.  All right, uh, yeah, we'll get into this thing.  There's something you can't eat in Jersey and it's, it just amazes me they had to actually  print this up in a paper today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.

I don't do anything, though.  I just get the glory for doing nothing  as my brother, like, works 80 hours a week.  You're a silent partner, they call it.  That's right. 
[00:44:30]  But not that silent.  I'm there all the time, hanging out.  I'm like, Jake LaMotta.  I just kind of greet the people.  Go in.  I just like, hey.  Tell some stories.  Every once in a while, I buy someone a drink  and go, hey, here's an appetizer.  How you doing?  That's all I do.  That's my brother.  He knows the restaurant business.  But it's a big night at FH Riley's.  I know a bunch of people from the show  are going down there.  A bunch of the fans.  And I know Steve from Bayshore.  He's telling me he's going down there  with a group of people.  And, God, I don't even know if I should say this. 
[00:45:00]  Celebrating my cousin's 40th.  Yeah.  So, you could see a lot of people  that kind of look like me tonight.  It's like different variations of Opie.  Right.  Yeah.  He's like Rocky.  He goes from table to table  telling NEW stories.  Yeah, I remember.  Back in the day.  One time, there were these girls  in these 55-gallon drums.  You know?  And we were dumping a lot of stuff in there.  And it was fantastic. 
[00:45:30]  You know?  We dumped in crickets.  Put in some crickets.  And what do you need?  Salt and pepper?  Okay, one minute.  I'll get it for you.  That's what Rocky was doing  in Rocky Balboa.  Yeah.  The movie.  Like, he'd be telling stories  and some people are like,  all right.  All right, enough.  Will you shut up?  Bring me my steak and shut up.  Yeah, I'm kind of hungry.  Will you shut up?  So, you know,  Apollo Creed comes in  and he starts, you know,  hitting me and stuff.  So, I lay back a little bit 
[00:46:00]  and the guy's just looking at him like,  salt.  Yeah, he's looking at his watch.  We got a movie to catch.  Enough with your dumb stories.  It was pretty good, though.  I liked it.  Are you out of your mind?  I didn't think it was that bad.  Excuse me.  One of the worst movies.  Can I finish my plug?  Oh, damn.  F.H. Riley's,  Huntington Village,  400 New York Avenue tonight.  Of course.  There's a big night  at my brother's joint there.  I just thought it went without saying.  Like, everyone knows.  And you can meet some of my uncles  that kind of look like me  and my brothers.  It's just, like, 
[00:46:30]  many different versions.  Different variations.  It's like one of those video games  where you can model the person  on whoever you want them to look like.  Yeah, just that.  And you change a few little things.  You make the face a little wider.  Yeah, different hairstyles.  Different hair,  different facial hair.  This version of Opie,  I'm going to give him no hair.  This version,  I'm going to give him  nothing but gray hair.  It's like an add-on,  Opie Sims.  Yeah, let's see what Opie looks like  with a 70s porno mustache.  Did you pick up that video game,  The Sims?  It's brand new for Rich.  Yeah, Rich.  There you go. 
[00:47:00]  I'm sorry.  Sorry, that we're talking  over your head.  Yeah, brand new game out there  called Sims.  Anyway, back to Rocky.  Oh, The Lost Boys.  I should give them a nice plug.  Yeah.  They do some of that rock and roll.  A little rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Yeah, I went in.  Went in.  I watched Rocky  and thought it was going  to really be bad.  I wanted to completely hate it.  We goofed on it and everything.  And I watched it.  Aside from, 
[00:47:30]  and I said this,  aside from a couple  of real cornball moments,  I thought the movie was okay.  It was fine.  It was a good movie.  It wasn't,  it wasn't,  oh my God,  this movie's great  or fantastic,  but it by all means  didn't solve it.  And it was better  than you thought.  Yeah, it was a lot better  than I thought.  When we all heard  Rocky Balboa was being made,  we're like,  oh my God,  oh here it is,  you know.  Listen,  the only good part  is when he was hit  in the flesh  that flew off his old face.  There was nothing good,  there was no,  there was no anger,  real anger in him. 
[00:48:00]  There was no contradiction.  That girl served no purpose.  She was the Adrian type  inspiration character.  Because they couldn't get Adrian.  Because they couldn't get Adrian.  And then there wasn't  any anger or anything.  There was,  and there kind of was,  there was this internal,  like he hadn't completed something.  But it was not anger.  The kid had more anger  than he did.  Well, the father-son relationship  was ridiculous.  I didn't get that.  But he didn't have,  he had kind of like  some anger to him  because he felt  he didn't finish something.  He was still a fighter  that wasn't fighting. 
[00:48:30]  So he just wanted to do it  one more time.  Whether he won or lost,  he just wanted to get in the ring  and stand toe-to-toe  with a guy and box.  And that was it.  I thought it was fine.  They didn't even have  a good dog in the movie.  A good dog stunk.  Like Budkes.  Hey Rich,  you're doing a movie review.  Yeah.  I need a reference point.  Give me one movie you liked  in the last year  or two years.  Or in your case,  the last movie you saw  which was probably  ten years ago.  That's good.  The truth you wanted  when I saw the other night 
[00:49:00]  was great.  What?  The Last King of Scotland  was great.  Oh yeah,  that was good.  Damn.  Damn.  Oh darn.  Yeah,  of course it's a great movie.  I didn't know a big fat guy  was ever the king of Scotland.  You said you were going  to watch it last night,  did you?  Of course not.  I watched DVR  to American Idol  because,  see,  this show affected me.  We played the clips yesterday.  So now instead of watching  The Last King of Scotland,  I went home  and turned on the TV  and the DVR  and I watched  the American Idol  from the night before. 
[00:49:30]  With Crazy Girl?  Crazy Girl  and little fat black girl  that lost her mind  and started crying  and crazy stupid gay guy.  I had a watch.  Yeah,  the gay guy  is just,  whatever man,  you're not going to be  the next William Hong.  It was so over the top  it wasn't believable  on any level.  Excuse me.  But we had a,  speaking of American Idol,  had a little show meeting  yesterday after the show  and was informed  that Bush Baby guy  and Real Life Cartman, 
[00:50:00]  Real Life Cartman  that is a little slow.  Yeah.  He's like a Special Olympics athlete.  Yeah, he's an athlete  and Bush Baby guy  have an agent  and are doing the media tours.  They're doing all the talk shows  and we're offered to this program,  the Opie and Anthony show.  And I was like,  you know, fine.  But if,  as we're talking to these people,  I don't care what I bring up,  if an agent comes over to me 
[00:50:30]  or a publicity person  and says,  no, you don't,  don't talk about this.  Don't go there.  Don't talk.  No, they have to go now.  It's like treating them  like it's Brad Pitt  coming into the studio.  I'm going to punch somebody  in the face.  Probably the retarded kid  because he can't punch back.  No, some of them are strong.  I'm a faggot.  But yeah,  well, they get their retard strength.  It's legendary.  It's legendary.  But Real Life Cartman,  I want to hear him,  I want him to come in  and sing.  I want him to sing.  I don't want a publicity guy going, 
[00:51:00]  no, he's not singing.  They're doing like a thing where,  no.  No.  Sing, fat boy.  That's right.  That's right.  That's what I want to do.  I kind of want to play  crazy girl again now.  Oh, was that the last one,  the girl from the...  The girl that we were...  Just kind of came in all happy  and then she lost her mind.  On yesterday's show,  we were trying to figure out  what was wrong with her.  She can't sing.  And we decided she had a...  Bipolar.  Bipolar we're going with?  Yeah.  This girl is nuts.  It gives me...  I have bipolar bear. 
[00:51:30]  Bipolar?  She lives, what,  in the North and South Pole?  Thank you.  This girl gave me chills  when I was watching  American Idol.  Yeah, there you go.  This girl was giving me chills  when I was watching  American Idol the other night.  It was just creepy  and I was just thinking to myself,  there are people  walking around the streets  in New York  that are just like her  that could snap at any moment.  Just not stable whatsoever.  Her name's Sarah Goldberg.  Yeah, it was Sarah Goldberg.  Someone has to know Sarah Goldberg.  We want her on our radio show.  Yeah.  We want to make her snap. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, what?  She has an agent?  They're not taking any...  She's in hiding.  Sarah Goldberg.  Is this worth doing again?  Yeah, play a little Sarah Goldberg.  Because you didn't see it.  I didn't see it until yesterday.  But because you played it yesterday,  it made me miss  The Last King of Scotland.  I had to watch this crazy girl  and believe me,  I was not disappointed.  Were you a little freaked out though?  A little freaked out.  You know what?  I'm surprised we didn't pull a clip of  when I watched last night  was that girl  who was so upset 
[00:52:30]  that her father  wasn't proud of her.  Oh, yeah.  And she had to leave.  Yeah.  She went to the audition in New York,  I think from Ohio,  and didn't tell her parents  that she was staying with friends.  For two days.  For two days.  came to New York to audition  and could do nothing  but cry.  Yeah.  She was a cute girl too.  And she just is crying.  And she starts getting into  like deep stuff like,  you know,  my father is not  proud of me  and all I want him to do  is be proud of me. 
[00:53:00]  And you look into this poor girl  going,  what the hell is this  sleazebag father?  Because now everyone  that knows this family  is going,  boy,  Bob's a real son of a bitch.  What a scumbag.  What an ass.  What an ass.  Give the girl a kiss  telling you love her.  Right, jeez.  God, Bob,  you stink.  What the hell is Bob  doing to his daughter  after hours?  He screwed her up.  That's a great point.  The guy's just going off  to work in the morning  and smacking her in the face.  You're a piece of crap.  You ain't worth nothing.  I was thinking that  like he chains her 
[00:53:30]  to a bed or something  when he goes off to work.  Chains her to stay there,  slut.  You sick bitch.  You know, Dan,  that was the observation.  Oh, that's all I was  thinking last night  is this poor girl.  I'm looking at the girl,  poor girl,  poor girl,  poor girl,  but I'm not thinking,  yeah, Bob's the people  Bob works with.  Yeah.  Oh, what a douche.  Looking on,  boy, this guy,  he ain't half the a-hole.  He's happy at work.  He treats me nice.  You know,  and then all of a sudden  he goes home  and calls his daughter  an ass.  And she's trying so hard. 
[00:54:00]  It actually was,  when she came out,  she like dropped  to her knees pretty much  and was just crying  her eyes out.  And the beauty  of the story,  she makes it to Hollywood.  Yeah, she makes it.  Because American Idol,  they've been setting  something nice this year  where they give you  the big, huge profile  like this sob story  and you're like,  oh, wow,  this girl.  Obviously they make it.  This girl's going to Hollywood  and then, no,  they yank the rug out  from underneath her  and kind of say,  you do stink,  just like the profile 
[00:54:30]  was showing.  You're right.  In past seasons,  if they did a profile  on someone,  you automatically went,  all right,  don't even show the audition.  I know they make it.  This is where this girl  came from.  But this year,  they're on to us.  Yeah, this year,  it's like,  no,  they set you up big time  and go,  nope,  nope.  She's as lousy.  Gone.  She's as lousy  as this profile show.  We like to,  you know,  give you a little more  information so you can  maybe have some kind  of relationship  through the television  with this person.  Know a little bit  more about them.  Like,  build them up as a person.  Make them likable  so then we can make  it really feel like crap 
[00:55:00]  when we pull the rug  out from under her.  But this girl  was really upset  and she comes out  and she was just,  like,  all she wanted  was her daddy  to be proud of her  and she comes out  just weeping  like crazy,  tears running down  her face.  And then they did  a phone call.  Yeah.  And Ryan Seacrest  is there with the phone,  puts it on speaker,  holds it,  and then they're  talking to the father.  Can I jump in  really fast?  Because I will not  allow American Idol  to get to me. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Because, like,  I start feeling  for that girl.  I'm like,  oh my God,  you've got emotion  in your body.  Ugh.  Yeah.  I start getting  just a little moisture  on my eyes.  I'm like,  no,  I'm not going to do it.  This is hilarious.  You're not doing this to me.  You're not doing,  I know what you're doing.  You're pulling at  the heart strings here.  I'm not going  down that path.  So I changed.  Like,  I was starting  to go with it.  I'm like,  no,  I want that phone call  to be horrific.  I'm hoping that the father  is going to say something  like,  I still don't approve. 
[00:56:00]  I don't.  You get home,  you're in trouble.  Right,  exactly.  You're not going  to Hollywood.  Come home now.  Her nickname  is Mistake.  All right.  But anyway,  guys,  I had to just jump in there.  So they get her  on the phone  and  she's talking  to her father.  They put the call  through the father  and she goes like,  Daddy,  please don't be mad  at me.  I went to New York  to audition for American  Island.  I made it up  going to Hollywood.  Oh,  Daddy.  And Ryan Seacrest 
[00:56:30]  is even chiming in  and going,  you know,  are you proud of her?  This guy's like,  yeah,  yeah.  And then she goes,  I love you.  I love you.  And he's kind of like,  yeah,  love you too.  It wasn't even like,  I love you,  sweetheart,  or something nice  or all,  you know,  I'm so proud of you  and everything.  It was just like kind of,  yeah,  love you.  I bet you American  Island,  they didn't have the balls  to do like a cold call.  Yeah.  They set it up beforehand.  I had to.  This is,  I have to pick  everything apart  and Lindsay hates it 
[00:57:00]  because I have to just  wreck it for everybody.  I'm like,  you know,  blah,  blah.  I bet that they actually  talked to the father  for a few minutes  to make sure  he's going to be okay  with this.  And then they set up  the call like,  all right,  we're going to call you cold  and make believe  like you're finding out  for the first time.  Well,  it was a panicky Pete call  because she's crying.  She's on the phone.  She goes,  daddy,  I have something to tell you.  Don't get mad.  All I was thinking,  yeah,  if I was the father,  forget about it.  Yeah.  All I would be thinking is,  you'll do what we tell you  to do,  you dirty, 
[00:57:30]  low down sluts.  A negro.  Wasting your time  with a black.  That's the crying phone call.  I was going to say,  like I slept with your partner  to get to New York.  Yeah,  yeah,  something.  And the father's like,  well,  what's the matter?  A lot of people are pointing out  that the dad could care less,  just like you.  He could care less.  You could tell from the phone call.  Yeah.  This guy could care less  and this poor girl,  just all she wants in life  is daddy's approval  and this scumbag 
[00:58:00]  can't give it to her.  I turned to Lindsay,  I go,  man,  there's a stripper pole  in her face.  I'm sorry.  Oh,  when it goes,  unless she wins the whole thing.  Yeah.  Because you know what  American Idol's all about,  you know,  name one person  that went to Hollywood last year.  Yep.  That didn't make the actual show.  You can't do it.  Right now,  she's famous.  Absolutely.  That stupid Ian guy,  the weird gay,  Gloria.  Yeah.  You're always on the run now.  How much do you just want to punch him?  Yeah,  he's famous right now, 
[00:58:30]  of course,  but in another week,  no one's going to give a crap  and if this girl doesn't make it  all the way to the finals,  no one's going to remember her name  and then hence,  stripper pole in her future.  If she ain't coming back from Hollywood,  there's a nice place on Sunset.  That's what dad...  Yeah,  it's a nice club.  Yeah.  That's what dad was thinking.  Call me when you're in the finals,  all right?  Don't waste my time.  The father would be like,  oh,  you made it to Hollywood?  That's good.  Good.  Big deal.  I've made it a lot of places.  Look where I'm at now in life.  Five dollars.  You're still a nobody.  You know what five dollars gets you?  Doesn't even get you three dollars. 
[00:59:00]  Go ahead.  Crap on it.  And the kid is...  What kid's crying?  It's a raise.  It's somebody telling me I was good.  Have you go to school for two days?  You're in college.  Who cares?  Gloria,  you're always on the run now,  running after somebody.  You're gonna get them somehow.  I think you got to slow down  before you start to blow it.  I think you're headed for a breakdown,  so be careful not to show it.  You really don't remember. 
[00:59:30]  Was it something that he said  or the voice is in your head?  He pulled the lyrics, though,  out of a Louis Vuitton bag  that he had brought in.  Sorry, Reg.  Do you think the title...  Do you think these people  are really that crazy  or they're stepping it up?  There's a smorgasbord.  There's a smorgasbord.  Thank you, Anthony.  Some are absolutely out of their minds.  Some are retarded. 
[01:00:00]  Delusional.  Some actually think they're good  at singing,  and they stink.  There are some really pretty girls  that have just been told  their whole life,  oh, you are so good.  You should be on American Idol.  Right.  Just because it's some guy  that wants to, you know...  It runs the gamut.  Yep.  And some retarded people  and some people that know  that if they do something  over the top  and it goes over,  that regardless  if they make it onto Hollywood  or not,  they're going to have some fame  and get on the news  and have their 15 minutes.  Yeah.  Fathead Rosie's speaking out. 
[01:00:30]  Did you see this?  On this one,  American Idol only uses  to exploit retarded people.  Yeah.  You know,  enough with the causes already.  It's not exploiting.  They show up.  You put them on TV.  They were actually very nice  to the retarded kids,  the two,  the Bush Baby  and Living Cartman.  They were nice,  but they were there  so we could kind of...  Yeah,  that's the only reason  they aired it.  So we could kind of  point and laugh  because we all have that in us,  but most people like to...  They're embarrassed  that they have it in them.  I don't want to feel this way.  I'm laughing at them 
[01:01:00]  and it's making me uncomfortable  that I'm goofing on the retarded.  I laugh at every one of them.  I laugh at the one.  Yeah.  It's a comedy.  I don't feel bad for them.  Yeah.  Who cares?  You can tell when someone's good.  Like the first note  that comes out of their mouth,  you're like,  okay,  they're good.  Move on.  Move on to the retards.  Move on to the freak show.  Sundance head.  Sundance head.  Sundance is going to be a good one.  And then that other chick  from the same show  we're commenting on,  what was it,  Wednesday night?  I guess.  Is that what it was?  She's very attractive, 
[01:01:30]  kind of tall.  The friends?  Yeah,  well,  the friends,  the other,  the friend that,  the second,  she came in second,  she was pretty girl.  Yeah.  And then there was another one  toward the end of the show  that was pretty hot.  I missed the last half hour.  And great,  great voice.  Really good.  So she'll be a contender there.  And then the,  yeah,  blockhead,  the big fat guy  with the beard.  Yeah.  Sundance.  Sundance head.  But that's the second part  of the show  where it takes on  like the talent thing. 
[01:02:00]  There's two parts to that show.  The talent competition  later on,  but we're in the early phases,  the retard hour.  Yeah.  What about the fat girl  that played guitar  in the street  that was completely  out of her mind  saying,  you don't like rock and roll  or something?  I don't know.  You didn't see?  Oh.  I don't remember it  to be honest.  Someone also saying  dad didn't even know  it was her on the phone.  That's right.  Yeah,  yeah.  He's like,  who is this?  She's crying saying daddy  and he actually was like,  who is this?  Who is this?  She goes,  it's whatever her name was.  She had to actually tell her 
[01:02:30]  like,  it's Sarah.  What are you doing?  How'd you get my number?  Yeah.  What if I want to play Sarah?  You know,  for two days,  I've been in New York.  You were gone.  Right.  He didn't even know.  Weren't you at breakfast  this morning?  I don't remember.  He's too busy  banging his secretary.  That is so,  you know something?  There's something  just based on that.  I kind of,  you draw these conclusions  like he doesn't want  to be with his family.  Right.  It's not that  the father doesn't approve.  The father could care less. 
[01:03:00]  Care less.  What's the guy's name?  John List?  I want to play Sarah Goldberg,  but now,  I don't know.  We might have to move on  to other things.  Yeah.  We got lots to do today.  That's all right.  We played it yesterday.  It's interesting,  though.  Do you watch  I Love New York?  That's the show,  man.  No one's watching it,  though.  I think it's getting  big ratings.  No one's watching it.  I don't know anybody.  Well,  it's not as big as the-  And they won't be.  I can't get enough  of reality shows.  Is that the one  about Grease?  No,  which I Love New York? 
[01:03:30]  No,  Grease is the one  where they're casting  a Broadway show.  That's a disaster.  That's a bomb.  Yeah,  that's getting nothing.  That's a bomb.  Who cares?  I Love New York,  though.  You didn't see the clip?  You watch it,  Keith?  With the guy,  I broke,  man.  Every week,  religiously,  we sit on the couch  and my wife looks at me  and goes,  why do we do this?  You can't stop it.  It's great.  Yeah.  But what is it?  What's the theme?  It's the girl  from Flavor Flav Show.  Oh.  The spinoff 
[01:04:00]  from Flavor of Love.  Yeah.  All right,  whatever.  Yeah.  You guys don't know about it,  so that's not really worth  getting into right now.  Hey,  but what is worth doing  is the CSI line of the day.  Oh,  no.  Haven't done it in a while.  We got some Caruso.  Got some Caruso for everybody.  Nice.  A brilliant actor.  You familiar with this,  Rich?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's just,  I'd recently seen  a movie called Session 9.  It was on TV the other night,  just popping around, 
[01:04:30]  and it was a David Caruso movie.  He's in it,  and he was acting,  and it was good.  He was doing a great job  like he wasn't  taking me out of the movie.  He was a real person  with emotions,  and I was like,  what happened?  Now all I think of  when I think of him  are these awful CSI clips  where he can't act  as an over-the-top guy.  Really fast,  we got Teresa.  Teresa from Indiana,  what's up?  Hey,  how you guys doing?  What's going on today? 
[01:05:00]  Why are you calling  the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, my God.  This is the second day  I've listened to you guys.  My husband gets me up  every morning at five.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys had me laughing  so bad yesterday,  I damn near pissed on myself.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  Let me just say...  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you can't really  say that word.  Wait, so you've been listening...  Here it comes.  So you've been listening  for two days...  Yeah.  ...and you were laughing  really hard.  I'll clean up your language.  Really hard yesterday. 
[01:05:30]  No.  What was it that  really got you going?  The chick that...  He's batting  a thousand.  I just have to say it again.  The man  never misses.  No.  No.  The streak  is unbeatable.  Shh.  I love that stupid gag.  I got updated.  I'm the Cal Ripken  of that gag.  Oh, yeah, you are.  I was going to say  the Lou Gehrig, 
[01:06:00]  but look.  Lou Gehrig.  That record is done now.  What was I going to say  about that?  God, that's funny.  Jesus.  What are you...  Oh, I just love  click.  You're going to ruin it.  Oh.  Who couldn't be  on to it by now?  You're going to ruin it.  Because now I've got  to pick my spots.  Yeah, you've got to watch...  She was perfect.  Only two days  you're listening?  You are so done.  Anyway, here is today's  CSI line of the day.  David Caruso.  What's going on,  I wish you. 
[01:06:30]  Alex, Miami  has a new breed  of criminal.  Yeah!  Alex,  Miami  has a new breed  of criminal.  And it's my act.  All right.  He should be  arrested.  But the last  King of Scotland,  if he doesn't win an Oscar...  Yeah, we've been  saying that for a while.  But you know what I think?  See, Forrest Whitaker 
[01:07:00]  is never going to play  a leading man again.  I mean, that's...  He's not...  He's got that dead eye.  You know, so...  He's always had it.  I know.  So, I mean...  You know, between every shot  they had somebody run out.  All right, get his eye.  You know, brother?  All right, shoot.  All right, we got it.  Wait, is he...  Does he only have one eye?  Is that a fake eye, you think?  No, I...  No, because...  It's a droopy eye.  No, it's like...  It's a wall-eyed  or the word  that starts with P. 
[01:07:30]  You ever hear that one?  That one...  Poo-hye?  No, no.  It's the P word  for a thing you do  in the restroom.  Ah.  That starts that.  And, you know,  it's got the S's in it  and stuff like that.  That word.  And it ends with an E-D.  Really?  Yeah.  I thought it was just  a dead eye.  It's just...  Not the E-D.  Sorry, sorry.  It's called...  I don't know how  it got that way,  but it's called  the P word.  Eyed. 
[01:08:00]  Okay.  Rhymes with hiss.  Yeah, I got it.  Geez, thank you.  I don't care  if it gets dumped out of Al.  Al.  You make that decision.  Al.  As a matter of fact,  it's called piss-eyed.  That's what it's called.  All right?  I'm tired of it.  Jesus.  I don't think...  I don't think  there's anything  wrong with the eye.  I think it's the eyelid  that just has...  Yeah, it kind of hangs  down a little bit. 
[01:08:30]  No, it's great.  They had to make him...  Get his eye.  They had to make him  look blacker.  Yeah.  Yeah, they darkened  him up for it.  I was watching  The Last King of Scotland.  Idi Amin was a dark guy.  Yeah, I'm thinking to myself,  I don't remember  Forrest Whitaker  being that black.  The Negro.  And then he's been  interviewed all over  the place lately.  I'm like,  all right, okay, yeah,  he wasn't that black.  That was all makeup  to make him even darker.  They made him darker.  It is not a sin  to get rid of a dirty stain.  And Idi Amin was just a...  Uh, Teresa.  Yeah.  Hi, what's going on? 
[01:09:00]  What happened to you?  I don't know.  I got disconnected.  Ah, these damn phones.  Yeah, I tell you,  it must be  the operation guy over there.  It's something...  The operation guy?  What is that?  The guy that works the phone.  Oh, that works the phone.  No, believe me,  don't get down on her.  It's, uh...  It's just, uh,  sometimes we have  technical difficulties.  You know,  all these phones  are computerized.  Yeah.  It's not like the old days  where you actually got a phone  and buttons and stuff.  Teresa, I apologize to you,  especially, you know,  the new listeners,  because we're trying to get  new listeners every day,  so that's no way to treat you. 
[01:09:30]  So when we hear that,  you know,  you've been listening  a couple of days  and you like the show,  we kind of, you know,  because it's a big  word-of-mouth thing,  you know?  And we're on in 25 cities  and we're trying to,  we're trying to see  what people like out there.  Yep.  Like about the show, so...  That way we can do  a little more of it.  So after two days,  what do you like  about the show, Teresa?  Well, you got...  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  See?  It's just,  he gets up  and you just know  it's going over the fence.  Oh! 
[01:10:00]  Welcome to the show,  dummy.  Two in a row.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Let's get right back  into this.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  People are asking  for the John and Jeff moment.  We can do that  a little later.  The moment?  Yeah, we do a John and Jeff  moment of the day.  Also,  a great 9-11 call  to...  9-11, 
[01:10:30]  9-1-1 call  to get to.  I thought you...  No kidding.  I'm sorry.  I don't think there are  many great ones of those  unless, honey,  I made it out.  Yeah.  Good point.  Oh, yeah.  And what can't you eat  in Jersey?  Oh.  All right.  Yeah, that's a big story.  I heard that on the way in, too.  And people get frustrated.  It just shows you  that we have so much  to do with this radio show.  My God,  let's just go till noon.  Listen to the other radio shows.  You'll see they really  don't have much going on.  And by saying 
[01:11:00]  listen to the other radio shows,  we really don't mean that.  No, we do.  Turn the dial right now.  Leave and leave.  We don't need you.  No.  We do.  We do?  Yeah, I think it would be best.  All right.  You know,  we started the story,  so I think we should continue.  We got Crying Sarah.  Yeah, we did.  We can't just leave that  loose end.  Oh, by the way,  Rich Voss is here.  Whatever.  Rich,  filling in for the James Norton. 
[01:11:30]  Where's Jimmy?  Well, I don't know.  Jimmy's flying all over America  every weekend,  and Rich is driving his car  to Firehouse.  He's on the Firehouse circuit.  Well, I'm done with that.  This is what I'm adding.  Oh, you're adding something else?  Oh, that's real.  Oh, a big gig for Rich Voss.  Look at this.  Wow.  I just do the Firehouse one time,  but, you know.  Who'd you blow to get this gig?  Oh, please.  Well,  1-1000,  2-1000,  3-1000. 
[01:12:00]  I'm a big act.  I'm a big act.  All right.  For everybody listening on  WCKG in Chicago.  Yep.  We're loving Chicago.  Someone called earlier  and said that they're really  starting to see a lot of  wow stickers in the Chicago area.  Nice.  That's a very good sign.  And we know it's going to be  a tough sell for Chicago.  Yeah.  They like their own.  They're still listening to  Jonathan Brandmeier.  Ugh.  What is wrong with you people?  Johnny B.  Good old Johnny B.  Johnny B.  They like their homegrown talent.  I respect that to a point, 
[01:12:30]  but you got to at least  give us a shot.  Oh, you'll go.  Listen, they're supposed to be  the hip city.  But listen, you guys,  I give it.  Oh, shut up, Rick.  All right.  Please.  Please.  Please, shut up.  Oh, my God.  I was leading back to me, Rich.  All we ask is,  if you like the show,  you tell someone about it.  That's how we spread the virus,  the O&A virus, okay?  Yes, Rich Voss at the Chicago Improv.  That's very cool.  Yeah.  February 22nd, 23rd, and 24th.  Beats the firehouse.  Wow. 
[01:13:00]  They got you in the middle of,  in the middle of winter  because no one else  wants to travel to Chicago.  Let's be honest here.  Anything I do, let's turn.  First of all,  I have the worst agency.  I'm at the Improv in West Palm  in August,  and I'm in Chicago.  Yeah.  It's just unbelievable.  The rotation I'm in right now,  I can't get out of it.  I bet you would love  to go to Chicago around June.  Yeah.  Nice time.  You get the February.  Nice, yeah.  Walk around.  All right.  Choke in the city.  Hey, Sarah.  So this is what you were talking about 
[01:13:30]  before the break.  Yeah.  And you know what?  They were trying to pull  at my heartstrings,  and they almost had me.  This is the one  they almost had me on.  I'm like,  no, I will not allow this to happen.  They got me on this one.  Not like crying or something,  but I really,  I felt so bad  for this poor girl  that all she wanted  was her father's approval,  and she's crying her eyes out.  Do you ever get teary eyeballs, ever?  Yeah, I told everybody.  I did when I first saw Ghost.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:14:00]  When that single tear  comes down Demi Moore's face,  I kind of was like,  I'm watching the movie,  and it wasn't even  a conscious response.  Like, I'm watching it,  and the music is playing.  Oh, my love, my darling,  I hunger for...  And the single big tear  comes out of her big eyes,  and this was when  she was really cute  and everything,  and the tear came down her cheek,  and I just,  I found myself,  and I'm watching the movie, 
[01:14:30]  and out of nowhere,  I went like...  And I'm like,  what the...  What just came out of me?  What the hell was that?  Your co-text.  Yeah.  Al, if you dunked out of that,  then you're messing up our show.  No, I had a tear from...  Don't dump out of that.  I had a tear from Simon Birch.  Oh, the one with  the little kid,  dancer kid?  No.  The little fidget?  He was kind of like  retarded, like compact. 
[01:15:00]  He wasn't retarded.  I thought he was talking  about the dancer kid.  No, Simon Birch,  and he's brown at the end.  Just because he's a little,  a little compact thing  doesn't mean he's retarded.  I made a mistake.  Keep your afflictions straight there.  You're upset  because he's calling him retarded.  You just called him  a little compact thing.  What the hell is...  It looks like...  It looks like you put  a normal 10-year-old  in the old garbage compactor.  Just squished him down  a little bit.  Squished him down a little bit  and then said, 
[01:15:30]  all right,  walk across the floor  so I can laugh at you.  Oh, man.  That's the worst.  When you're with a girl  and a tear,  you don't want her to see it.  You know,  if you're watching a movie  and a tear like...  Yeah.  I'm not crying.  You know,  you got to be like tough,  you know?  The worst thing  is being alone  because if you're with a girl,  you have...  There's a way to control it  because you don't want to  like be bawling  for a movie  in front of a chick.  But when you're alone,  there's no one around. 
[01:16:00]  So you're like,  oh, boy.  You're controlled by...  Oh, I'm hungry.  I'm going to go  get some dessert.  You want something?  Just get up  and leave the room.  You bite your tongue  until it almost bleeds.  That makes you cry.  No, no.  It won't make you cry.  It takes your mind off of things.  Or sometimes  you take yourself  out of the movie.  You picture the cameras  and a director  and everything  kind of just telling the person,  all right,  now cry or do this.  You know,  and then it takes you  out of the movie  and you don't get 
[01:16:30]  all emotionally worked up.  My sister and I,  we used to cry.  Fags.  If you hear the song,  if they find it,  when my parents  were getting divorced,  we were like four,  you know,  second grade.  It was your fault too,  by the way.  Children's fault always.  There was a song  by Sonny and Cher.  I have to go now,  so kiss me goodbye.  And it's about a parent  getting divorced  and a father leaving  and it would come on  in the car  and me and my sister  would just be crying.  We're just crying.  My mother's driving  this big old,  one of those round  like Fords or whatever 
[01:17:00]  and we're bawling  because my dad  is banging someone  in New York  and it's not coming  home again.  Thank you for ruining  my life.  There's Rich in the car.  Songs about us.  All right,  here's Sarah.  It all started  with Sarah.  Anthony finally saw  American Idol  from the other night  and this is the one  they really wanted us  to really just start  crying.  Just wants to make  daddy proud. 
[01:17:30]  By the way,  there's a ton  of people listening  right now.  They cried their eyes  out during this scene.  Yeah.  My name's Sarah Burgess.  I'm from East  Palestine, Ohio  and I'm 19 years old.  My parents don't  know I'm here  and I'm auditioning  in New York.  They don't want me  to audition,  especially my father  and I don't think  they understand  how much this means  to me  and how much  this is my life.  I think you see  when she cracks.  This is like  everything to me.  Me and my dad  hit heads all the time  because we're so different  but I love him  but he doesn't. 
[01:18:00]  We're on different levels  with things  that are important to us.  He never believes  in me and everything  and I really want  my dad to tell me  how proud he is of me  and he knows  I can do it  because I always hear  how disappointed he is.  I never,  I never,  I never go up  to his expectations.  Never.  This father  is a scumbag.  He really is.  What a scumbag.  And like I said before,  everybody watching 
[01:18:30]  that knows this girl  and knows the family,  I would,  I would go over,  hi,  Sarah's father,  bam,  just punch him  in the face  and go,  could you kiss her,  pat her on the head,  give her a little support,  you douche,  help the girl out.  She's crying her eyes out  and all she wants  is your like support  and love.  She wants to be known  as daddy's little girl,  you ass.  Daddy's little girl  and you treat them  like crap.  Not daddy's little  disappointment.  Well,  maybe she hasn't  accomplished anything  in life  and she has been  a disappointment.  She's a kid, 
[01:19:00]  she's 19 years old.  Who else was praying  after that  that she was toned down?  Oh,  that she just stunk.  That would be good.  Father tells me  I can't sing  but I know,  he's right.  Ma,  wa,  la,  la.  Well,  let's hear,  here she is.  Ba,  ba,  ba,  ba,  ba,  ba,  ba,  That was awful.  And,  well,  here's Sarah singing 
[01:19:30]  after that emotional  introduction.  I saw the sign  It opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  Ladies and gentlemen,  your next American idol!  Without understanding  I saw the sign  And it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  No one's gonna drag you up  To get into the light  Where you belong  You don't have to play the song  It was in my head 
[01:20:00]  At full volume  As I was getting dressed this morning  Oh really?  Thank you very much  Yeah  I woke up with it just  Firmly entrenched in my head  I've been singing that one  And Gloria  You're always on the run now  Shut up  Yeah I saw the sign  That will be stuck in your head  All weekend long  That's how we spread the virus  Yeah  Because you'll be cursing us  Going  Some people just  Ball over some dumb movies  Gotta be kidding me  What?

Right at the very end  When Harry's forced to go back  Oh to go back into the wild  And they had already 
[01:21:00]  Made friends  Evil John and the cow  Just shed the tear  That gave me a tear in my eye  Yeah  Alright  Thanks guys  You rock  Alright  Carry on  Did you cry in a casino  When they batted Lou  Pesci  J Bill  On Pal Talk  Is coming  He goes  I cried too  But I was like five  Alright listen  Here's Sarah  Talking to the judges  You missed a parrot  Making a putt  Yeah  You talked about this yesterday  But now he's taking

They've been very nice to us this week  There's no reason to punish them  Whiff  I gotta  I gotta  I gotta  I gotta do the jersey thing  Oh  Without getting sidetracked  Yeah  They've been very very nice this week 
[01:36:30]  So  I don't want to make them suffer too much  I heard the story  I cheated  I heard it on the way in  Did you?  On the news station  Were you completely amazed  Like what?  Yeah that  In America  They have to  They have to tell you not to do this?  It's 2007  Owned slaves  Yes  In certain parts of Jersey  I wouldn't understand  If this story was in Canada  Right  Or Maine  That's called a callback people  Thank you  But  But Jersey  Jersey  Jersey  There are parts of Jersey 
[01:37:00]  But this doesn't seem like one of the parts  No  That would do this  Now to a warning about eating squirrels  You heard it right  What?  Who are they talking to out there?  The hell is out there  Who the F is the news talking to?  They had a little  A little little thing in Beirut yesterday  More soldiers dying in Iraq  Yeah  But you know  They gotta take away precious air time  To tell you not to eat squirrels 
[01:37:30]  Don't eat squirrels  Who is eating squirrels in Jersey?  And especially with opossums  You don't mix them together  Because you'll really get sick  Tastes like garbage  Squirrels  Like who's  There's homeless people in New York  They live in and eat track rabbits  Rats  Right?  Track rabbits  Is that what they call them?  Underground people  The mold people  Track rabbits  There's not one person you've ever met  That ate a squirrel  All right here we go  No I don't know anybody  Now to a warning about eating squirrels 
[01:38:00]  You heard it right  New Jersey officials are warning hunters  And residents near a toxic waste dump  In the Ringwood area  About consuming the animals  The action comes two months  After a lead contaminated squirrel  Was found in the area  Now officials say  This is the first time  The state has ever issued  An advisory regarding squirrel consumption  A letter sent to Ringwood residents  Actually advised them  That children should not eat squirrel  More than once a month  Pregnant women should limit their intake  To twice a month  And adults should not eat squirrel  More than twice a week 
[01:38:30]  Duly noted  I had no idea  There was that much squirrel  Being eaten out there  To save the truth  That's a lot of things  I don't know  Yeah  Did we just go into a time machine?  Is this the news from like 1820?  I had no idea  There was so much squirrel  Being eaten out there  Look man  People eating beaver  Because that's a delicacy  Let me  What a smarmy report  That was  I eat only the finest steak 
[01:39:00]  Every night  Yeah  But you  Common folk  Had no idea  Squirrel  Pregnant women  If you're pregnant  You shouldn't be eating squirrel  Just based on economics  The kid's gonna cost you money to raise  If you gotta eat squirrel  To survive  Because you can't go to the supermarket  And pick yourself up some chopped meat  There's a problem  Who's eating squirrel?  What class of people  That we see on cops 
[01:39:30]  Are eating squirrel?  Is it the trailer trash  White people  That get into domestics?  Is it the  Black guy  That committed the crime  That's being  Subdued by the police  As his girlfriend  Comes over  And tries to beat up the police  And gets arrested also?  Is it the Hispanic couple  That are having a knife fight?  Who are eating squirrel?  I wanna steal this  Jews  The Jews  Are not eating squirrel  It's not a  I see a rabbi 
[01:40:00]  Running after a squirrel  Trying to bless them  Maybe the Chinese  I would guess the Chinese  Chinese?  Or the Koreans  Because they ran out of dogs  No  I wanna steal this line so bad  But I just can't do it  To Steve in Queens  Steve what's up?  Hey guys  Hey  Yeah you know  If you're at a point in your life  Where you're eating squirrels  You got bigger problems than less  Yeah  There you go  Sure I don't think you care  About the lead in the squirrel  Right  The squirrel  The squirrel taste  Well 
[01:40:30]  That's the heaviest damn squirrel  I have to carry it around either  Look  You know the bit  Coming soon to the  Opie and Anthony show  We're eating squirrel  Squirrel eating  We're eating squirrel  Set it up  Set it up immediately  We'll get  We'll do it like we did  With the rat  Yeah  Contact Steve  At foundrymusic.com  The executive producer  Of the Opie and Anthony show  That's F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  Music.com  We know a chef  We know a chef  We did this back in the day  With rats  The faithful listeners  Know that  We actually had 
[01:41:00]  Listeners eating rats  New York City  Subway  Rats  They were brought in live  Not pet store rats  They were brought in live too  And the chefs  Had to bash them  Over the head  And kill them  And then skin them  Filet them  Get whatever meat  You can off of it  And then cook it  One guy  Mark  Frenchy  Was able to  Cook rat meat  In an  Aplave  He made rat 
[01:41:30]  Aplave  And it was  Fantastic  You didn't take a bite  He almost ruined  The bit  Because people  Were going  No I didn't eat it  Because it's a rat  No  But yeah  What Ed's getting at  Is like  Obviously when you think  Like we do  Cook rat  Get listeners in  Get them really sick  Really funny  We wanted like  Whole rat  Roasted on a stick  Right  With his teeth  And  But yeah  You gotta bite  Like pieces of beef jerky  Like meat off of them  And then we get to  Point at you  Exploit you 
[01:42:00]  And laugh really hard  Right  Then the audience  They're like  Wow I gotta listen  To these guys long  That's how it works  There's one  There you go  We got some pictures  Up on the  Yeah there you go  Why don't you put  Those pictures back up  On opiuminatpity.com  From the old days  And then Frenchy came in  The chef  And cooked it au plave  And people not only  Didn't get sick  They were coming back  With empty plates  Going  Can I have more  They wanted more rat  You just wanted to see  Because he cooks  He cooked it really well  And Frenchy knew  How to kill the rat  Yeah 
[01:42:30]  In a humane fashion  In one  One  One whack  Thrashing whack  To the back of the neck  The rat was dead  But he knew exactly  Where to hit it  It was dead  Instantly  Then we had another guy  Thank god we had  This other guy  Or else the bit  Would have been ruined  It would have just been  Eat  Ew  There's a plate of rat  Plate of rat meat  There's a plate of rat  Oh  Boss is going to puke  There it is  Oh god  Boss is going to puke  Oh my god  So am I  Oh  Look at the big plate  Of rat meat  It looks like slimy  Sushi eel 
[01:43:00]  Oh  There goes Boss  Oh he's really  He just gave him a bucket  You're puking  See  See this is why we do this  Boss has a weak stomach too man  I forgot that you have  A weak stomach  Him and Bob Kelly  Oh jeez  But he has a lot more  Look at it though  It's like slimy  Like everyone  Not everyone  A lot of people have had  Like eel sushi  It looks like kind of eel sushi  But slimier  Well it's cooked kind of rare  Actually if you mixed an eel  With like an oyster  You just wanted people to 
[01:43:30]  To bite it off a stick  Like drinking it out of a goblet  Yeah yeah  Kill him  But yeah like a renaissance fair rat  Like those big drumsticks  They walk around with  Someone comes through the studio  Jousting somebody  Yeah just feeding rat to people  So let Ant continue here  And these pictures are going back up  On opieandanthony.com  So we had another guy  Thank God  That came in  And said he was a professional chef  And this guy  Was as much of a chef  As Jeffrey Dahmer was 
[01:44:00]  He came in  Killed the rat  And it was the most  Inhumane death  Of an animal  I think I'd ever seen  In my life  It turns out  He was just a listener  That wanted air time  He never cooked a rat before  I think he wanted to just  Kill a small animal  Yeah the best  The best he ever  Ever did  Was maybe do a little  Hamburger helper  He had no idea  How to cook  Like he gave the rat  A whack  And it got out of his hand  So it was just  Kind of spinning in circles  Because he  Screwed up part of the rat brain  That tells it how to walk 
[01:44:30]  And people are horrified  They're like screaming  Women are screaming  And crying  As he's trying to grab this rat  To give it another whack  On the head  And he missed  And caught its nose  This rat  He just beat the crap  Out of a rat  I didn't call this dad  I just want you to love me  Love me daddy  You just saw the plate of rat  Right  That Frenchie cooked  Au pois  Au pois  We called him Jeffrey Dahmer  Look at what he cooked  Look at that mess  It's just a wreck  So he finally killed it 
[01:45:00]  He finally killed it  He peeled the skin off  Chopped it up  And just fried it  In a pan with nothing  So it was this gamey  From the description  We got from people  Because I wouldn't taste it  Was he the first one  To be kicked off  A top chef  Opie Anthony  Yeah  Yeah we were doing  The top chef show  Before it came out  Yeah  And it was awful  But his plate of squirrel  Did not disappoint  People were  Rat  He was making people  Yeah he was making people puke  And it was amazing  Look at the difference  Look at the two plates  Some rat  One is a great presentation 
[01:45:30]  There's some tomatoes on it  A lemon  Just in case you want to put  A little lemon  Au poivre sauce  A little piece of bread there  Yeah some bread  That looks like a French restaurant  And it looks like a Chinese take out  Yeah  The one on the left  The one on the left  Looks like a plate of vomit  It looks like raw oysters  It's a plate of vomit  Raw oysters  And people ate that  And puked  And then people ate French cheese  And asked for more  Went back for seconds  Look it's tender  It's moist  It's medium rare  That day the stars aligned nicely 
[01:46:00]  For the O.P. and Anthony show  That was one of our perfect  But remember we got in trouble  I forgot all about this one  Because we had people cooking in the studio  And it set off the smoke alarms  Oh yeah  And they go right to the fire station  Yeah  So the firemen showed up  And we had to explain how  No we're just cooking rats  Yeah yeah  And they were really pissed off  That they had to show up  Hey  What was that  Oh hey  Hirokh  You're going to do some  That has nothing to do with rats  Wow  What the hell is going on there  Did that happen here  Well I guess that was the halftime show 
[01:46:30]  In between  Holy mother of pearl  Oh my god  Why god  That is just a couple  Having sex  That's a lady  Is it a  No that's a  Yeah  Oh  Yeah  That's a lady  Yeah that's two  That's two women  Was that the day that the  Charity event was going on  And we invited  The priest in  No  Oh Steve remembers  What's up Steve  Of course Steve remembers  Those were the two young ladies  That were brought in  At like  For post show festivities  After the rat cooking  Yeah  And one of the chefs  Wanted to abscond 
[01:47:00]  With one of the  Items  Uh huh  And we had to  Escort him out  He wanted to leave  With that item  That has the strap on it  Yes that one  Oh okay  And the buckles  Yeah he was  And the marital aid  Yeah he was  He was nuts  So um  Obviously  Let me see  Something  Where did all the people  Go that have eaten  Squirrels  Look at all of them  Steve we want to  Cook up squirrels  What  People are going to  Email you  We got to get  Squirrels  I know what the 
[01:47:30]  Lawyers are going to say  So make sure they're  Not toxic  No toxic squirrels  Well we just don't  Have to get them  But don't get them  From that lead place  In Jersey  And we're going to  Cook up squirrels  Because it's  Very popular  More popular than  You realize  People are calling  Like crazy  I know I say that a lot  But they are  And they've had  Squirrel  All their lives  We found some  Breeders too  You found some  Squirrel breeders  Wait breeders  Yeah there are  Squirrel  There are exotic  Animal breeders  I don't know  Are they made for  Eating  Well they're germ free  It's called having  A backyard 
[01:48:00]  Yeah I know  Squirrel breeder  They do it themselves  Everywhere  Yeah  If there was one  Species that is  The furthest thing  From endangered  It's that god damn  Squirrel  Remember the candy  Growing up squirrel nuts  That used to rip  Your fillings out of  Your mouth  No  You never had that candy  I swear to god no  For real  Squirrel nuts  It had nuts in  Like caramel  And you would eat it  It would just rip out  Everything out of your mouth  No we ate something  That was probably against  Because of your religion  We called them jujubes  And it was very hard 
[01:48:30]  Because they would  Pull the fillings out also  Hey  Yeah  I got a little surprise  For Rich Voss  Who's playing  Chicago Improv  Let's give that a plug  February 22nd  23rd and 24th  Go to your website  For dates  Or what  Yeah  Go to  RichVoss.com  For dates  Okay  Alright  We got the song  That you used to cry  Oh really  When you heard  When my parents  Were getting divorced  This is the song  Yeah give us the set up  So you'd be in this awful car  Your mom would be driving  You and your sister  It was like an old big car 
[01:49:00]  It would be me  My brother  And my sister  My brother was young  And he didn't know  What was going on  And my sister was older  How old were you  I was probably like 6  I was like 6  And she was like 8  Or something  Like 4th grade  Or whatever  And your parents  Were going through a divorce  Or you  Yeah he just won't  I remember he just  Wouldn't come home  You know  Yeah they try to keep it secret  From the kids for a while 
[01:49:30]  And then you realize  Why isn't dad home  For like 2 weeks  Alright this business trip  Has lasted 3 months  Alright I'm on to you now  Business trip  He refills the candy  In vending machines  That's what my father did  It's like what  Are they sending him out  To Ohio  The Ohio branch  Of the vending machine  He's got to put M&M's  In a friggin slot  And real quick though  But then when your parents  Were divorced  He would come over  Every 3 weeks  And get everything  Into one visit  Yeah  He'd yell  He'd come in  He'd hit me  He'd lecture me  Yell  Sit me down 
[01:50:00]  Have a discussion  Take us out to eat  Give us money  And leave  You know  Every time  Yeah it was like  Everything in one  But it was so shit  Never got that  Never got that part  Always nice  After they got divorced  Even before they got divorced  Never mean to me  Or anything  Just psychological damage  Between him and my mother  Yelling at each other  All the time  But it was  When he would come over  To pick up the kids  He just wouldn't stop  His lifestyle  That he was doing  During the rest of the week  He would take us  To the bar  That he hung out at  He'd sit us down  Get us Shirley Temples  At a table 
[01:50:30]  And go to the bar  And hang out with his buddies  Watch TV  Drink his beer  Yeah  And then we'd all get  Into a car  With a drunk  And he would  Weave us home  With no seat belts  And the steel  Eye beam  That was the  Dashboard  Of a rambler  That we could have  Just smashed into  At any moment  Well he didn't use  My mother used to  Use us  Like my father  Would come every couple  Of weeks to see us  And we'd sit  I'd sit in the window  Waiting for him to arrive  You know 
[01:51:00]  Oh here's daddy  Oh you'd wait in the window  I'd wait in the window  And then my father  Come walk  Daddy's here  And then my mother  Would have  Detectors hiding  And jump out  And handcuff them  And arrest them  Oh that's healthy  For the kids  We're in the window  Hey  Oh happy daddy's here  And now he's being  Taken away in handcuffs  So  Who is more screwed up  Your mom  I remember  He went to these lengths  To set my father up  He went to New York 
[01:51:30]  And we were in Jersey  That is great  She goes  You're gonna go see your dad  We'll take you into New York  So we would take the bus  Go all the way from Jersey  By bus to New York  With my mother  We'd get to the Port Authority  He'd meet us there  And the cops would arrest him  It was a whole day excursion  So she could set up my dad  With us  And he must have did  Some horrific things  To your mom  Wow  You're thinking  Who's the worst  Him for not paying  Child support  Or her for using us  With that  Well now you can visit him  In a jail cell

[01:53:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America  Coming soon to the show  Squirrel eating  Maybe we'll do just roadkill day in general  There's other things we could cook up on that day  But definitely squirrel eating coming to the show  I like how we were in lockdown  What?  Yet somebody has a special pass  That they're able to actually get into  A lot of the lockdown  What?  When we go into  What?  What?  When we go into lockdown  What's lockdown?  Lockdown means  Nobody comes in  We can't get distracted by calls 
[01:53:30]  Subjects on Palta  Because we want to make sure  We pick up on the subject  That we were doing before  I like that new idea  That's why it's lockdown  When?

[01:54:00]  Coming to the show  And we finally did  A show prep meeting yesterday  This is a very rare thing  But we decided  What the hell  We had ten minutes to kill  After the show yesterday  So we sat around and kill  And batted around some ideas  And coming soon to the show  Your blank  Your blank's got talent  Right  Your blank's got talent  Coming soon to the  Opie and Anthony show  Yeah figure it out  Got to keep it clean  For over here  But it gets people thinking  I'm sure there's a threat 
[01:54:30]  On whack bag already  What does the blank mean?  Your blank's got talent  Coming soon to the  Opie and Anthony show  It does involve a young lady  Aw man you ruined it  No I didn't  Alright  No one knows what that means  Alright very cool  I stepped out  Yeah  Take care of what I had  To take care of  Sure  I come back  And these two are just  Telling horrific stories  Of like  Divorced  Yeah  Divorced stories basically 
[01:55:00]  It was divorce war stories  Again  I mean  Things just pop up  When you talk about this  Things you  Completely suppressed  Just pop out of nowhere  So I remembered  Where  When my parents  Were divorced  I'd ask my mother  Like oh  Well  You weren't happy  Obviously at the end  But why'd you stay  Married so long  And she goes  Well it was for the sake  Of you  You know  You guys  And stuff  We didn't want to  Thanks  Don't do us any favors 
[01:55:30]  So instead of  You know  Maybe five years  Of hearing the yelling  And screaming  We had to go through  Like ten or twelve  Of the yelling  And screaming  And then she winds up  After they're divorced  She winds up  Hooking up with  This guy  His name was  Dennis  Dennis  Dennis  Sounds like a douche  And my mother  Just went like wild  You know  I think Dennis was twenty  Or something like that  Yeah  Dennis was like twenty  He was wearing your clothes  Yeah  Exactly  You know  I was 
[01:56:00]  I was  I was like  Early  Early teen  I guess  Maybe  Somewhere around there  Maybe not even  Maybe I was like twelve  Or something  And I used to build models  So I was building  The visible V8  This thing was cool  It was a V8 engine  That was made of clear plastic  And you put the pistons in  And stuff  And the spark plugs lit up  When it went around  And the starter motor  Was the motor  That made the whole engine spin  You could see the works  How an internal combustion engine works  The valves moved  But I screwed something up 
[01:56:30]  And one of the pistons  Was binding in the cylinder  Because I didn't put it  In the right cylinder  And Dennis  Comes passing by  And all he ever did  Was criticize anything I did  Because he wanted you  Out of the picture  He just wanted to  Of course  He's twenty  He doesn't want to be  Our father to three kids  He just wanted to  Bang your mom  There were three kids  My brother's like  Old enough where  He's banging and smoking pot  And just you know  My sister needs  Some kind of guidance  That he's not going to give  I'm like this 
[01:57:00]  Like nervous wreck  Just trying to build a model  And he comes walking by  And sees that  I did something wrong  And he goes  He goes  All you do  Is screw things up  It wasn't even like  Hey you know  Do you need help over there  Let me see  Oh yeah  This piston  Has to go in this cylinder  Because the crankshaft  And it's binding on there  He just looks  And gives like a  And he goes  All you do  Is screw things up  And how old were you  I was like twelve  He's basically saying  Don't ever second guess 
[01:57:30]  Why your dad left  Yeah yeah  Look at this model  That was pretty much  The reinforcing of that  He was trying to get you  To run away  Yeah run away  Maybe get hit by a truck  Never come back  So he could have  Sex with my mother  In peace  My mother would take us  Put us in the car  And instead  To take us to my grandmother  On my father's side  We're all sitting here  Three of us  My sister  Me and my brother  Right  Just three little messes  In horrible clothes  Right  She'd always bring us  With ripped clothes  To show everybody 
[01:58:00]  We didn't have money  Right  And I think she rips some  Before we'd even  Leave the house  She takes us to my  Grandmother's front door  At our apartment  Rays the bell  And goes  I can't handle them  I don't want them  You take them  Right  And you're sitting there  You're going  This is abandonment  It's complete  And abandonment  I mean  You're like a little  Seven year old kid  My daddy  Already left  Okay  So you don't think  He wants you  Then your mother  Completely 
[01:58:30]  Verbally says in front of you  I don't want them  I can't  So she can go out  And drink and get laid  Or whatever  Anybody now  So at least you know  Why you were like  Snorting crank back in the day  Well yeah  Anybody would call them  Now would go  Call them on  The grandparent  And go  Hey can you watch  The kids for tonight  Yeah  You know  I'm going to drop them  Hey you're going to  Go to grandma's house  Dump them all  Not open their car doors  You're going around a turn  It's still moving  Yeah  Alright get out  It was horrible  But they would put you through 
[01:59:00]  Complete abandonment  And then we  One time  We used to pick on this kid  Where I lived  We'd pick on the kid  Right  And then  The mother was yelling at me  And my mother went over  To yell at her  And that mother  And the daughter  Beat up my mother  And I sat there  I was cracking up  Right  Because finally  They're beating up my mother  On the front door  And they really  They whip my mom's head  Like some retribution  Yeah I'm going  Well you know  Hey  Don't stick your nose  But now you  You used to drive around  In the car  With your sister 
[01:59:30]  And your mom  And this song would play  Oh yeah the song  I want to hear the song  Alright yeah  This song would play  And divorce  You know  You're newly divorced  And stuff  And you would  You would get very upset  Upset  We'd be bawling  I used to not be able  To watch any shows  That mention  I'd get like all embarrassed  If a show came on  Like an after school special  And it was about divorce  Yeah  I couldn't like sit there  And watch it  I couldn't look at anybody  Because I was like  So ashamed  That my parents were divorced

[02:11:00]  human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their  ability to turn mistruth  into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:11:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[02:12:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are at XM.  Thanks for continuing with us, whoever you are out there.  Damn it.  This thing just updated.  And Brian from St. Louis.  He's a faithful listener to the show.  He had a great instant feedback.  We need a better system.  A new program.  I usually tell the guys to print them up so we have them in front of us. 
[02:12:30]  What does this do?  Maybe this way?  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  It's worth reading.  Because everyone's talking about that last segment we did over at Free FM.  Yeah.  Brian from St. Louis.  Sons of bitches.  I'm sitting in my cubicle here at Boeing laughing my ass off.  And then he writes, why did my mom hug me so much?  That's why you're sitting there, fucker.  My cubicle, yep.  His cubicle.  You just summed up like creativity in one statement, basically. 
[02:13:00]  You've got to make your own when you're in those situations, you know?  I'll get the attention.  It might be negative as a kid.  I might be the humorous one in the classroom, but, you know.  It's comics and serial killers are what that type of upbringing creates.  You could go either way.  My mother, in school, this is in sixth grade.  All the kids are in the lunchroom in sixth grade.  And all of a sudden you hear, oh, my.  It goes silent.  And my mother came to the lunchroom because I was a parent. 
[02:13:30]  As we're all exiting out as a kid, I was out there with my mother and the principal.  And she was smacking me in the head in front of the whole school.  I'm going to fucking, I'm going to kill this bitch.  Yeah, really.  You have a right to.  No, she's dying.  By the way, a lot of people.  Who's dying?  My mother.  She's on her, well, you know, Alzheimer's just won't get out of bed.  She's completely shot, you know.  So she doesn't remember?  No.  So you could hit her and she couldn't even tell.  Why?  You could just go. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, really, you could really get her back now.  She lives like only like 15 minutes or 20 minutes and I go.  We know the story, right?  You didn't pay for the home that she's in or something.  No, no.  No, the meals on wheels.  I did that.  The meals on wheels.  Yeah, by the way, don't let that deathbed crap fool you.  She was an awful lady.  Some of the things she did to you.  Why did you all of a sudden feel better?  Absolutely.  I remember, I've told this story, I haven't told it in a while, but my mom's mom, don't 
[02:14:30]  acknowledge that she was ever a grandmother.  We call her my mom's mom.  Her name was Aunt B, believe it or not.  And that was before I got the dumb old B name.  But we would call her Aunt B because the last name was, you know, B, obviously.  Because we didn't want to acknowledge she was a grandma.  She was just an awful, awful lady.  Aunt B, probably where my mom's problems come from.  And she came to the house a few times and right around, I don't know, I think I was about  10. 
[02:15:00]  I really don't know.  To be honest, I was still very young.  And she was gone, out of my life forever.  It turns out she sued my parents for money they borrowed because, God forbid, they had  six kids and they needed a little help at the time.  Seven kids, they needed a little help.  So they borrowed money from her because I guess she had some money.  Oh, boy.  And they didn't pay her back fast enough.  So my mom's mom actually sued her own daughter.  Just awful fucking bullshit crap, right?  That's nice.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  This is a legendary story. 
[02:15:30]  I haven't told in a while.  Lawsuits.  Because you remind me because of the deathbed crap.  So fast forward, I'm now I think like 23.  Haven't seen her in 10 to 15 years, somewhere in that period.  I don't know.  And my mom calls and says, yeah, Aunt B, she's dying.  She had a stroke.  She's in the hospital.  She's not going to really make it.  And for some reason, my mom, well, I guess, for some reason, no, I want to say it that  way.  For some reason, my mom needed to see her.  I'm like, whatever.  And so I went and supported my mom. 
[02:16:00]  I'm like, yeah, I'll go.  I'll go.  So we walk into this hospital room and there's this now just old, decrepit lady laying in  this bed.  And she was just a twat to us and everybody around her.  She was just not a nice person whatsoever.  Now, the last time you had seen her, was she like younger and vibrant?  Yeah, scary.  Yeah, scary.  Like scary.  And then all of a sudden, she's-  You know, those old people, not that she was, you know, she probably, when I say old, she's  probably, I don't know, maybe mid-50s, early 60s. 
[02:16:30]  But she was like that scary old, like you knew she could get something done.  Yeah, I'm old.  And just nasty, right?  Yeah, I know.  That's what's so weird when I was just about to say that.  I'm like, God, when you were a kid, old was a lot different than what you think now.  So anyway, we go in there and my mom is like pretty much saying goodbye to her mom, which  is an emotional scene, I guess.  I guess.  And then she sees me kind of at the doorway, because I'm barely in the room, because I'm  like, I have nothing to do with this freaking thing, this thing in the bed that can't walk 
[02:17:00]  anymore because she had a stroke.  And then all of a sudden, she's like squinting, and she goes, Precious, Precious, Precious,  is that you?  I swear to God, like an old fucking movie.  Precious?  Precious.  I guess she showed a moment somewhere when I was like a newborn and told my mom that  I'm Precious.  And that was my nickname when I first started my life on this earth. 
[02:17:30]  Fuck, was she wrong?  And she's like, oh, Precious, you've grown.  Duh.  And instead of maybe giving her a little something on her deathbed, I go, Mom, I'll be waiting  in the car.  Do what you have to do.  That's exactly what I said.  Didn't even hang out for the big final farewell.  No, she ended up lasting a little longer than that, I guess. 
[02:18:00]  But how come everybody says, oh, you've got to let go of the let go?  And then my crazy mom's sister, because she's not an aunt either, like some broad I've seen  once or twice.  It's my mom's blood sister.  I was in the hallway down the hall, like peeking around corners, all paranoid that we now connected  with this old broad to try to get money or something.  And my mom never cared about money in that way.  But this paranoid older sister is like, didn't have the balls to come into the room when we 
[02:18:30]  were there, but she's like peeking around corners and stuff.  Like, what's that about?  My mom's like, oh, she's paranoid that, you know, we're making an appearance because,  you know, she's going to die soon and this is in her and stuff for grabs.  Her sister came in and made her sign a paper with her mouth.  That actually, don't even let, dude, really?  Well, yes, there were things like that going on, because there were, whatever, it's too  long for now.  But the signature looked very suspicious on some documents that were looked at after 
[02:19:00]  her death.  Let's just put it that way.  So that, you know, whatever.  They're all funny.  My aunts and uncles had so much money and my grandparents left them a multifamily house  between my aunt, uncle, and my mother.  Three people, instead of giving it to my mom, who had nothing, they'd go, we're selling  it and give you your share, you know, and fucking right to another apartment.  Instead of letting her get on her feet, you know, I fucked, my family would fuck them. 
[02:19:30]  I'm so glad I'm semi, semi, semi famous.  Guys.  Fucking assholes.  Anyway, whatever.  So it just gives me anxiety to talk about my childhood and fuck them all.  Dude, it's, you know, I've said it many times as far as what I'm all about, man.  I had my dad's side of the family completely normal in every way. 
[02:20:00]  Every way.  Fun loving, good personalities, like to joke, you know, raise really good families, no real  problems.  And then my mom's side is beyond fucked up.  Yeah.  Dude, I, I, like my mom's sister, I haven't seen in, who the fuck knows, 30 years?  Wow.  25 years?  And she's out there somewhere.  Yeah, my dad had one, had one sister and her kids, you know, you could, I hung out with  them.  Two were brainiacs, you know, my age was deaf. 
[02:20:30]  So it wasn't great to hang out.  I mean, it doesn't sound like a lot of fun, you know, but it was, it was bizarre because  the one side, it was unbelievable.  The other side, especially in the early days when we still were trying to like get something  going with that side of the family, it was a horror show.  And then it was just, it was just time to move on and make believe that didn't even  exist.  I got like, I got like cousins in Massachusetts I've never met.  I mean, it is fucked up.  I had good times with my families, like the, the people that were related to my father and 
[02:21:00]  my mother were great, you know, it was just the relationship between mother and father  was really bad.  Right, right.  But everybody around, all the peripheral players, because every Christmas we would go to my  father's family and they were totally different than my mother's family.  My father's family were just partiers.  Like every time you went there, you knew it was going to be just a blast of a party.  Even as a kid, it was fun to just watch because all the adults were drunk and having fun.  Yeah.  And all of his kids were just running around like maniacs and stuff.  And then my mother's side of the family was totally different. 
[02:21:30]  Went over and there was like the plastic on the couches.  You weren't allowed in this room or that.  You got to sit there.  Very similar, man.  Yeah.  Really weird.  A lot of ways.  We were just a black sheep.  My cousins were all like good, like real smart.  You know, in Hebrew school, they were the best.  I was getting kicked out of Hebrew school.  I didn't go to Hebrew.  And like I used to run the canteen in Hebrew school.  You got kicked out of Hebrew school.  Because I got caught stealing the money.  Jesus is Lord.  I was stealing money and candy.  Stealing money.  Right.  My uncle, you're nothing.  He used to come over like to try to be my father and go to hit me. 
[02:22:00]  I go, don't touch me.  You're not my father.  You can't hit me.  Right.  And he would try to like, you know, reprimand us.  Like you stealing money from him.  It was Hebrew school.  Someone sent them.  Bill in Jersey City.  Go ahead, Bill.  Yeah, I want to know.  When you went to see Aunt Bea that last time, did you ask her, so Aunt Bea, what did you  like about my life?  Exactly.  You don't know the first thing.  And then he walks out into the car. 
[02:22:30]  That's all.  So, yeah.  What do you like about my life?  Yeah.  Click.  Click.  Click.  Goodbye.  Oh, yeah.  People ask, like, what do you remember about your mom's mom?  I remember going to Queens to this, like, cold brick house.  Everyone else had nice lawns and hers was brown.  The backyard was grown over, like, the Addams Family of just weird trees that had no leaves  on it.  And it always seemed like-  Unplayable for a kid. 
[02:23:00]  Unplayable, exactly.  And you would see the next yard and there's happiness and slides.  Swing sets.  And bright greens and stuff.  And in her yard, I swear to God, this is what I remember.  I'm not making it up, just a lot of grays and blacks and dark browns.  Wow.  You got some recollection of this.  And just, like, the wicked forest, just, like, these weird trees you don't see anywhere  else with no real, like, leaves on them.  And they would tell us to go play in the backyard.  We'd be scared.  I don't want to play in the backyard every time.  And I remember looking up and it would just seem like there was this dark cloud that was 
[02:23:30]  only over this house.  This is, if you asked me, this is what I would tell you every time.  Yeah, picture it.  And the house was just filled with Hummels and the smell of mothballs.  Old people.  Oh, I remember.  And, like, just old furniture with, like, no rugs or anything to kind of soften up the  house.  It was a shed in the back and all you saw were two feet with little striped stockings under  it.  Sticking out.  But then again, my grandma, totally different, man. 
[02:24:00]  Home-cooked meals, love, laughing, all that stuff.  But I was on your dad's side.  Yeah.  She was just an amazing woman.  Amazing.  Jesus.  Well, she took control, right, in your house?  What do you mean?  Well, did she watch you guys growing up or?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people watched me growing up.  Well, you were precious.  Yeah.  You got to take care of precious.  Precious.  Precious.  No, my mom, my grandma had a beach house in Waiting River.  Was that on the island? 
[02:24:30]  So I had a great, I had it, honestly, in the end, I had a great childhood.  I'm not going to sit here and cry.  I had a great childhood.  It was just different.  That's all.  Oh, yeah.  My cousin's had a beach house.  Yeah.  We all just reflect on our awful childhoods.  I know.  All of a sudden, we're taking warm baths with razor blades.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Look at that little girl.  I mean, hot girl, whatever.  No, my philosophy has been very simple and it's kind of hacky, but there's always someone  out there that's a lot worse than you.  Here's my...  I was talking to some people last night. 
[02:25:00]  Don't want to blow up their spot because there's some frustrations going on in my life  right now.  No big deal.  And then I got two phone calls in a row and I'm like, Jesus, you know, you got to remember  that other people have much worse lives than you.  It doesn't matter who you are.  Yeah.  Everyone's got their shit.  It was actually good for me because everything I did with my kids was a complete opposite  of what my parents did.  Yeah.  Well, I don't...  They never complimented your fine ass. 
[02:25:30]  No.  Like you do with your daughter, you sick fuck.  My kid...  I have...  Listen, I went to my father.  I was doing a TV show once and they needed baby...  You know, pictures of you growing up.  Yeah.  He had one.  One picture of me growing up.  One.  There's a box load of my cousins.  One picture.  I got thousands of pictures of my kids.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Movies, videos, everything.  They're on your hard drive ready to be destroyed just in case the cops come in, you perverse.  The first lock of hair that was cut off, the first tooth that was pulled. 
[02:26:00]  From where?  First lock of hair.  And when did you realize you had a nice ass?  No, I didn't...  I didn't...  It wasn't being...  You got ass pictures over the years.  Over the years.  Oh, this is...  It's just...  Yeah, normally...  You can see their face.  This is my daughter's ass at eight.  This is what I really knew.  She had something.  She's seven and a battery.  Here's the most recent picture of my daughter's ass.  Here's the paddle we use.  You're awful. 
[02:26:30]  I'm a good father.  You shouldn't notice your daughter's ass, though.  I didn't even notice it.  Creepy.  Let's see.  Well, should we do this today?  DJ, it's a couple.  What's up, DJ?  DJ, yeah.  Yeah, my mom was a fucking intravenous crank head, and when I was like 11, my sister was  like 13 or 14, and my mom's boyfriend paid my sister and one of her friends to like pay  them each a buck to show them their tits, and this shit got out around town, and when my 
[02:27:00]  mom found out, she got fucking pissed at my sister and slapped the shit out of her for  like doing shit that could kill her boyfriend or potentially get him in trouble or something,  but she wasn't mad at the dude at all.  She was mad because she only got a dollar.  No, she was mad because she was mad at my sister, but not her boyfriend, so she was kind  of a bitch as far as moms go.  Yeah, all right. 
[02:27:30]  Let's move on.  Where's your sister dancing now?  Yeah, ooh, he hung up that time.  9-11, 9-1-1, sorry.  Nah, 9-1-1.  9-1-1 dispatcher, dismiss his fire call.  This is what we couldn't get to over there and wanted to.  Dismiss his fire call?  How was the dump report today?  A few people are asking for it today for some reason.  I'd like to see that.  It's a good gauge on what we accomplished at our meeting.  Oh, they dumped out a piss-eye. 
[02:28:00]  I knew they would.  I damn near pissed on myself, caller, piss-eye, Anthony.  Who did you blow to get this gig, Opie?  What?  I knew they were going to dump out of that.  Are you kidding?  You should have said, fuck, who?  9-1-1 dispatcher, dismiss his fire call.  This is classic.  This is classic.  The story has a happy ending, by the way.  Oh, good.  Fire department, can I help you?  Yes, sir.  I think there is.  I don't know.  There's like a lot of smoke.  1.45 in the morning, a man sees heavy smoke, but no flames coming from Burt's Barbecue. 
[02:28:30]  He thinks it's on fire and calls 9-1-1.  But the dispatcher suggests the smoke is probably coming from something else.  It's white smoke, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah, it is.  Yeah, it's probably.  It's from their smoker, their, like I said, they took the risk of that.  I see.  Based on that conversation, the dispatcher elected not to send any resources at that time.  At that time, Burt's was on fire. 
[02:29:00]  Taxi driver Joe Perez could see it right in front of his face.  I noticed that smoke was coming all around.  Not from here.  All the way around from the building.  So now we got the cabbie, a second witness to this fire.  Thanks.  So we also called 9-1-1 and got the same dispatcher and same response.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Does it smell like the wood or does it smell like something else is on fire?  No, it smells like wood.  There's a lot of it.  And out of the chimney car across the street, I can smell it. 
[02:29:30]  There's like all this, you know, bit of a hazel smoke around here.  Well, could they be smoking their brisket?  No, that's not brisket.  You could tell that something was burning, you know.  It's not brisket.  It's not sausage.  It's burning.  After Joel hung up, the dispatcher finally sent firefighters out here to Burt's Barbecue,  but some 45 minutes after the first call.  And that's huge considering it would have taken firefighters about 45 seconds to get here. 
[02:30:00]  Their fire station is right down the street.  Well, why did the fire station realize?  Because they were listening to Rich Voss.  He was performing there.  Fuck.  They didn't want to be rude.  Yeah.  That was a place burning down, but I love this bit.  I saw smoke.  I just assumed it was because Rich Voss was bombing.  It's just great.  I'm on fire.  I was ready to really give it to the 911 dispatcher, but if the firehouse is that close, you got 
[02:30:30]  to think they're smelling smoke or something at this point.  I like that guy.  Is it the briskets?  I got to tell you, they are delicious.  I'm reporting a fucking fire.  Do your job and send the fire department.  By the way, I don't care if it's a fire factory.  Fucking send something there.  And if briskets is part of your vocabulary, a brisket, you probably eat squirrel.  Yeah.  It certainly appears that an error in judgment had occurred. 
[02:31:00]  You just can't help to be like, look, we may not be the brightest people about stuff,  but that might be on fire.  Burt's is now a total loss, and workers like Jason Goss are out of a job.  I think it's safe to assume that there was something going on when the first call came  in, and certainly having a 45-minute delay between the two calls would have made a difference.  I'm sure that would have helped a little bit.  And maybe you would have had a job today. 
[02:31:30]  Yes, ma'am.  Well, maybe now you'll go back to school.  There's a lot of laughing in that story.  Someone lost their business.  Yeah.  Heard a lot of chuckling.  It's insured, and I'm sure they have plenty of cooked brisket.  Yeah.  By the way, coming to the show soon, we're going to be eating squirrel.  And I was privy to a fine conversation as I was walking into the XM Satellite Radio studio.  Oh, by Steve giving Craig a talking to. 
[02:32:00]  A talking to.  Really?  Because Craig was all excited.  He was listening to the first half of the show, and he was basically telling Steve that  he could get him a squirrel.  For the squirrel eating thing we want to do soon.  Oh, yes.  So was it a bad talking to?  It was an interesting talking to.  Oh.  Craig, you could get us a squirrel, right?  No, that was Pat Duffy.  Oh, wasn't you?  Pat Duffy brought it up.  No.  Holy shit.  Isn't that great?  I confuse them all the time, too. 
[02:32:30]  Wow, dude.  They're not like real people to me.  Oh, my God.  They're not like real people.  They do have sort of the same look.  You're right.  It was Pat Duffy.  I'm sorry.  Our new intern.  I just assumed it would be you, because, you know, you're kind of...  Well, if you want, I can go out and kill a squirrel.  Why do we always assume it's you?  Because I assumed it was him, too, the other day when I had my run-in.  He's done some crazy things for us, one of these guys.  Yeah.  Bring in Pat Duffy.  Do they even look alike?  He's not here.  He's running an errand.  We're not even here.  He's running an errand.  What did he say to you? 
[02:33:00]  He said he could get a squirrel.  Right.  And I asked him where he could get it, and he made reference to shooting it in the head  with a BB gun or something like that and throwing it in the back of a truck.  Yeah.  And I was not...  I guess he does pest control.  Yeah, pest control.  But he kills them with BB guns.  That's what he calls pest control.  You know what's worse than that?  How awkward it is for him to still be sitting here while he has nothing to do with the  conversation.  He didn't know when to get up.  When did you realize we just weren't interested in doing it anymore?  And we weren't going to talk to you. 
[02:33:30]  See, now we need you again.  See how this works?  Basically, when you mistaken me as Pat Duffy.  That's what I realized.  I love these guys.  Thank you, Craig.  Craig?  Is that his name?  That's Craig, yeah.  Craig's done good stuff.  He's doing real good stuff for us.  I don't know what anybody does.  Then you went to Patrick Duffy and you said, look, I don't want a rabid squirrel.  Yeah.  Obviously.  The guy from Dallas?  Not Patrick Duffy.  He hasn't fallen that far since the Dallas days.  Oh, my God.  Geez. 
[02:34:00]  Patrick Duffy.  That's funny.  That's if he really walked through.  Guy, got your squirrel.  Yeah.  We're just trying to help him out, you know.  Well, because these guys are so eager to please, especially the new guys like Pat Duffy  and Craig and that group.  They're so eager to please that they'll do anything.  I'll bring in squirrels.  I'll do this.  I'm like, let me see if I can find a breeder first.  So when can we do the squirrel eating?  It has to be next week.  We have to do it right away.  Well, we're learning.  As a matter of fact, Travis just told me, when you go to a breeder to find squirrels, they're 
[02:34:30]  pretty expensive.  How much?  Like upwards of $500 for some kind of squirrel.  Get out of here.  Where's Travis?  For a pedigree squirrel?  Travis.  What?  It's a squirrel.  How?  Just get.  They're called liming greeners.  Let's get one for us.  In my backyard all the time, squirrels.  If I knew that was the case, I'm in the wrong business.  $500.  In the squirrel breeding business.  What do you know, Travis, about squirrels?  I found a place on 8th Avenue, and they go anywhere from $75 to $500. 
[02:35:00]  We want a $75 squirrel.  That would be a flying squirrel.  Can you get one with two legs?  The tasty ones.  Oh, the flying squirrels are more expensive?  No, the flying squirrels are the cheapest ones.  Why would they be cheap?  They fucking fly.  Yeah, man.  You would think that would be worth something?  All you need, really, Travis, is a puffy tail.  Thanks.  Hey, get the $75 squirrel.  I'll give him a call. 
[02:35:30]  It's going to look a little gamey.  It's a little ragging around the edges.  The fur's not going to be quite right.  It's going to be a little thin.  It's going to be thin with fat on it.  Yeah, put it this way.  The flying squirrels have to be pretty light.  Yeah.  You know, so I don't think you're going to get much meat off of it.  No, we want one with an addies and come in smoking, missing a tooth.  We want a Steve C. squirrel.  Will they go on the air with us?  Meaty.  I don't know.  I haven't.  I just found that.  We just found that.  All right, call them and see if they want a nice plug on the show today.  We kill their squirrels and eat them. 
[02:36:00]  And we're getting recipes.  Cajun squirrel we can make.  That sounds good.  We can make mesquite squirrel.  Chicken.  That's a smoke value.  I want to make chicken surprise squirrel.  Surprise.  It's not chicken.  Right.  It's a fucking squirrel.  Two squirrels deboned and cut into chunks.  That right there is something that you do when you're going to grow up and do the same  thing to hookers.  Yeah.  Debone and cut into chunks.  Put in 55-gallon drum.  Leave under bridge.  Save souvenir at the house. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Keep jewelry and ear.  In the worst case scenario, my mother's been trapping squirrels in our backyard out on  Long Island for about six months now.  And what, keeping them?  No, she's like, what's kind of dopey like?  Catch and release.  What'd she do?  Yeah, that's what, Keith?  During, you know, like she grows stuff in the backyard.  She has a garden, so the squirrels eat it.  And then, I don't know why she thinks that if she catches them and then relocates them  to, like, the state park or something a few miles away, that another squirrel just doesn't 
[02:37:00]  come.  Doesn't come and take place.  Why would she think she could grow anything in 10-degree weather?  That's what I want to know.  Well, she has been doing this for six months.  It's like, we want to kind of do this before summer.  All right.  If she's still got the trap and they're still out there, I mean, I'll try and trap a couple.  We've got to make sure we don't get a toxic or a rabid squirrel.  I think, yeah, now rabies is a problem anywhere.  The lead thing is only a problem in that Jersey town because there's a toxic waste dump.  But imagine if we gave a listen to rabies. 
[02:37:30]  It would still come in second.  We can fucking give a listen to rabies and still not be the most despicable show on radio.  We've had a fucking show kill people.  Don't worry.  A person.  We will end our careers being the most despicable radio show ever.  I got a doozy.  How about, oh, do you?  Oh, I got a doozy.  You got the fucking escape hatch.  I'm just waiting for the day.  Fucking blow the hatch button.  I'm just waiting for the day Anthony and I look at each other and go, yeah. 
[02:38:00]  It's time.  It's time.  Blow the hatch.  Blow the hatch.  We're going out in style.  Complete blaze of glory.  Oh, yeah.  Infamy.  Oh, yeah.  Got to kill people, though.  That's what it's amounted to.  I got a doozy.  All right.  I'm with you.  Barbecue squirrel as well is one of the other recipes we could choose from.  Bomb belt.  The mall.  Oh, Ian Anthony.  Jesus.  But I promise you, sir.  Yes.  Because I know you get a little paranoid about what goes on in my head.  I know. 
[02:38:30]  Over the years.  I see it.  I promise you that I will not do it without your permission.  Oh, thanks.  And then when you say yes.  It won't be a surprise.  It won't be a surprise.  Like, what the fuck?  What did he just do?  Oh, my God.  And I go, but I saw the look.  I thought I saw the look.  That it was time.  Will it affect my ability to get a career afterwards in radio?  Or will I just be done in radio?  Just make sure you're saving.  All right.  I'm done.  All right.  All right, Anthony.  You said yes.  All right. 
[02:39:00]  I'm going to podcasts.  Make sure you get a visa.  All right.  You're going to have to leave the country.  No, we got to make sure we cook up a squirrel that's going to be relatively safe.  Because the bit, obviously, is that you're eating squirrel.  That's just blech.  Do you have the same chef as before?  Well, I know Frenchie's been looking for something to bring him back into the good graces of the show and get him back in the spotlight.  And he's good.  I said we bring back Frenchie to cook some squirrel.  We should have good squirrel, bad squirrel. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  You know, because he would cook it where people would actually enjoy it.  Right.  And then he'd probably do it like, I want to make, I'll make a cacciatore, like a chicken cacciatore, but with squirrel.  And it'll be great.  And people will be asking for more.  And then we got to have a guy that just fucking is awful.  Just shoves a fucking stick up the squirrel's ass.  Doesn't know the difference.  And puts him over a fire with the fur still on.  And doesn't know the difference between squirrel guts and the meat.  Yeah, I want the squirrel to look like those bodies that were hanging out the window on the road of death to Baghdad. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, wow.  After the big bombing.  Wow.  That's what I want.  Just hanging out there, just charred, cooked alive.  All right.  Cooked alive.  Well, the guys are hard at work in the lab.  They're trying out different squirrel recipes.  Over at the Institute, they're doing it as we speak.  I would have three guys in and do the top chef with squirrels here.  Yeah.  And get rid of two of them.  All right.  Top chef.  Shut it down.  Yeah, we could do top chef.  That's not bad. 
[02:40:30]  Top chef with squirrel.  Not bad.  Get three chefs in.  And French, he's going to want to win if he wants to come back.  That's not bad.  By the way, when we get back, we actually did a show prep meeting yesterday.  And it lasted about 10, 15 minutes.  And we got a great idea.  We'll tell you about it next.  Okay?  Yeah.  Because I got to take a leak.  And they're running the promo already.  So, we'll listen to the promo.  Great.  In five years, I never once heard you say show prep.  I know.  In five years.  Well, it's against our religion. 
[02:41:00]  Well, show prep is for beginners.  The staff culls things for us.  That's right.  Little stories.  At night, we also email each other back and forth.  Go, hey, did you check this out?  But it's not like, at 9 o'clock, we will discuss this.  And at 8 o'clock, this story.  And when you talk about it, here's the script we'll go off of.  That's like what show prep reminds me of.  And I want no fucking part of that. 
[02:41:30]  And it takes the pressure.  Because then you can't really free flow or whatever.  Free flow.  Free flow.  Flow free.  I don't know.  All right.  I'm just bringing it to you.  I don't know what you're talking about, Rich.  All right.  Go piss.  Yeah, this isn't going anywhere.  Go piss.  We're going to go into game mode today.  Don't worry.  We're going to have a fine show.  All right.  Let me go.  That's hot.  I got blood rushing in my mule right now.  That is so hot.  Hey, look at my cock.  Waka waka penis.  Boing.  Boing.  Boing.  Insta boner.  Something touched my ball.  Jim Norton.  Well, just go ahead.  Give me your cock.  Can I fuck you?  Why not? 
[02:42:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Where everybody goes to get young boys.  I'm a young boy.  Pick me.  Good God, you're believable.  What do you mean?  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Laszlo in studio.  Yo, yo.  God, I just made a dumb statement.  No surprise there, I know. 
[02:42:30]  But hysterical.  I was talking about technology.  We're talking about it.  Remember the days when you would buy movies and they were over $100 for a movie?  If you had to buy it, you would never voluntarily buy a movie for the most part unless you were  rich.  But if you went, and not Voss, I mean wealthy, you went to the video store, you would rent  a video, and if you lost it-  You were fucked.  You were fucked.  And the person at the mom and pop video store, because they weren't blockbusters or anything,  would say, okay, that will be $110. 
[02:43:00]  And you're like, what the fuck am I buying?  It's $110.  And you wouldn't even question it, though, because you didn't know the movie cost $110.  Whoa, this technology.  What's in this case?  But it would cost you that much.  And the movie was worth, what, $10?  Who knows?  Yeah.  This all started, because I noticed my blockbuster is out of business, and it's all going the  way of, like, kind of Netflix.  Netflix.  They're on demand.  Blockbuster is done.  Eventually, once they get the compression down, it'll just be online. 
[02:43:30]  You'll be able to, at your computer, download-  Any movie.  Right to your TV.  You want.  There it is.  It's on it.  They're still choosing the movies that you should watch.  I hate that.  I want every movie available through history.  Right.  I want to be able to punch it up on my TV.  On demand is great and all, but you're still at their mercy of what they put up there.  Do you have to have HBO to have on demand?  You have to pay for cable.  You can't have rabbit ears on your fucking- 
[02:44:00]  No, I got cable.  I just love that earlier during the break, we were explaining the concept of the video  iPod to Voss.  Oh, Voss was asking questions like, can the iPod show video?  Like, can I download it?  Dude, how do you not know that?  Because, listen, here's the thing.  And I'm a dummy when it comes to tech shit.  I really am.  I have an iPod.  It took me a year to take it out of my closet, because I was nervous on how to work.  Did you hide it in there?  You were just nervous?  I'm nervous.  Listen, this is your life.  The iPod is as big as the transistor radio. 
[02:44:30]  He's got the first generation.  I got a big iPod.  Fucking idiot.  You just pointed at Laszlo and went, this is your life.  You know, like, Laszlo's the only one in on this secret of the iPod.  Laszlo, are you going to tell the public about the iPod someday and it's working?  And this magical thing called the MP3.  Okay, so here's the thing.  About downloading the movies, like you said, can you also put songs on that same iPod that  you can do all of this?  Just let them talk.  No, because I don't...  Enjoy it, kid.  And you can get it.  Well, like you asked before, you said how many movies can you put. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  When you...  To be honest, when you download, because movies are so big, if you download a movie to  an iPod, you can only put about two or three songs on it.  So you have to watch that movie and then get rid of it.  Okay, now you can put it on maybe five movies, though, right?  Then you've got to throw the iPod away because it's full.  No, I mean, if it's like a full link, like sort of Lord of the Rings, like your iPod's  full, so then you...  Or you say you can put a couple movies.  I'm not watching...  Depends what...  Lord of the Rings was a really long movie, Rich.  Do the math. 
[02:45:30]  That's what he's getting at.  You get a couple of shorter movies, you probably could get two on it.  But for a trip, you could do that.  Not much more than that, though.  Watch it and then dump it.  What's frustrating is the stupid battery life on those things.  Never last a whole movie.  Yeah, and then so it's like you don't know if they're watching the one or right.  I wouldn't watch a movie on an iPod, first of all.  It's a little silly.  In your car, though.  In your car.  What are you talking about?  You're fucking driving.  Holy Jesus.  You just get better and better. 
[02:46:00]  No, if you...  Because I was in a car the other day, like a car...  Are you driving the car?  Well, if you have it mounted, you're not completely paying attention to the movie.  You know what?  They're a DVD player that is so small and cheap these days.  You put them in your glove compartment.  It doesn't matter.  You can pull it out and watch a movie if you want.  I try to do that.  I try to...  So watch it on an iPod.  You know what iPods are for?  It's for like YouTube-type videos.  It's if you take a video or you have pictures, photos of your family and you don't want to  carry around a big wallet with paper pictures, you put that shit on there and you can show 
[02:46:30]  people like, here's a quick clip, you know, a two-minute video clip.  Full-length movies, it's silly to watch it on that little fucking scratched up screen.  Yeah, but who's sitting there watching little clips of YouTube?  You show your friends at work, you go, hey, dummy, look at this.  You know, check this out.  Well, where do you work that you wouldn't have a computer where you can get online?  You know, you could, but perhaps you don't want to have somebody fucking getting fucked  up the ass on your computer while your boss is coming over.  Well, hey, Anthony, here's a video of me masturbating to Rich Voss's daughters.  Check it out.  That's not a nice thing to say. 
[02:47:00]  You're the ones photographing their asses.  What's wrong with you?  Hey, I thought it was free reign.  You're talking about your daughter's ass.  No, but I didn't say how hot it was once.  No smoothies today?  Oh, there's problems.  No, the smoothie machine is broken.  Motherfucker.  So, in other words, you...  I'm arrested.  I know you got the connections.  You do a...  I just stay miserable.  All right, I'll need a cantaloupe and honeydew.  Like a little plastic thing of melon.  Kenny does it for me. 
[02:47:30]  I'll have a little mixture like Anthony's having.  Nothing else in it, though.  No blueberry.  Just cantaloupe and honeydew.  But you know what?  I don't get to it.  Honeydew.  There was no smoothies, and he did an audible and brought you...  No, this was my first choice.  Oh, it was?  Okay.  And then I switched it to the last minute, so he knew I wanted something.  He has a backup plan.  I had a backup plan.  Smart guy.  And the people that are watching these movies on iPods, they're called teenagers.  We are officially out of the fucking demo.  Out of the demo.  For real? 
[02:48:00]  I got it.  So there's...  I'm the old guy that likes the shit, so I got all of it.  Someone's saying you can get 10 movies on an iPod.  Really?  What is it, 60 gigs?  Maybe.  Uh-huh.  I got mine.  Mine's a 60 gig iPod.  You get what?  An hour of video is usually how many gigs?  10 gigs per hour?  Well, yeah, something like that.  You can only...  But, boss, the thing that happened...  Really, in good shape.  How many songs can you get on your iPod?  I got 250 right now.  Yeah, because right now, like, the biggest iPod, you can only get, like, 500 songs. 
[02:48:30]  On the new ones?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're lying to me.  Oh.  Oh.  Trying to get one.  Pass it.  You can bust out.  You lied to me.  Let's just fuck him up by giving him false information on everything.  Whatever...  If you really want your computer to run quickly, type in format C colon from a dog.  Yeah.  That's real nice, isn't it?  It's awesome.  Yeah.  Especially, I'm not going to trust you with that.  Well, of course not.  Can we basically...  In all seriousness, the problem with iTunes and the movie selection is that you've only 
[02:49:00]  got one main distributor that has agreed to put movies on iTunes.  It's Disney.  Paramount says that they're going to start kicking in some, like, old movies from the  80s or whatever.  But most of the movie studios are afraid, and they hate the freedom that the iPod gives  people.  But it's like, give me a break.  You're spending $15 for a movie the size of a postage stand.  Yeah.  You're spending more than you usually spend on a ticket in most places to go in to see  the movie in the first place, to watch it on a little screen like that. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  And if you buy a movie on iTunes, you can share it with three different iPods in the  house.  Let's say, you know, you've got one, your wife's got one, whatever.  Yeah.  And the movie studios are upset.  They say that's too much freedom, which isn't asinine.  Because if you buy a DVD, I mean, you hand that thing around to your friends, family.  No one you know has to get it.  Not the Rich Foss DVD.  DVD, that doesn't get handed around.  Oh, oh.  Well, this is where this all began.  So during the break, we started talking about technology. 
[02:50:00]  And I said to these guys that we're living in a great time because we saw a lot of things  change.  Mm-hmm.  Like dumb stuff like, you know, no cell phones.  Yeah.  Clunky VHS tapes.  You know, and we were, and I go, I think, I think it was a lot cooler for us than our  parents.  And then Anthony smacked me in the face with some knowledge.  But just, well, some people's parents, especially if they're a little older, were able to remember  the inability to fly to man landing on the moon. 
[02:50:30]  And so that might have been a little more impressive than, hey, my tape is crinkling up in the machine  to this handy shiny disc plays the same movie.  Yeah.  You got me.  Some grandparents, some grandparents went from nothing on their arm to tattooed numbers  on their arm.  Wow.  Thank God.  Thank God the Jew said it.  The Jew said it.  Thank God the Jew said it.  The Jew said it.  The Jews.  The Christians are staying out of that one.  My grandma.  Yeah.  No electricity. 
[02:51:00]  No cars.  Yeah.  Seeing men land on the moon.  I heard those stories.  Oh, is she honest?  No, it's true, though.  Because my grandma died when she was 92.  Saw men on the moon from, like, for nothing.  Man on the moon.  No electricity when she was a kid.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  No freaking cars when she was a kid to man on the moon.  Do you know anything about, like, your grandparents' lives?  Like, I just knew, or, like, the ones that are dead, that they were the parents of my parents. 
[02:51:30]  But, like, as you start getting older, you think, like, I know nothing of what this person  was about as a kid growing up, what they were into, what they wanted to be, what they wanted  to do.  Never sat down and got into a conversation, like, because who gives a shit when you're  a kid?  And then they dropped dead, and you're like, I am one, like, I know of one generation of  my family, period.  That's it.  That's it.  Hey, really, my dad had, he was into, like, making films and stuff when he was a kid, 
[02:52:00]  and so he has, like, some home movies, you know, like anyone else out there, but of a  Christmas scene.  My dad was probably 20, and there's a video of him, you know, videotaping his grandfather.  Oh, wow.  And then I did the math and went, holy fuck.  Wow.  This guy was, like, born in, whatever, 18...  The 1800s.  Yeah.  Ooh, that fuck.  Going, like, he has knowledge of, like, Abraham Lincoln. 
[02:52:30]  Wow.  You know what I mean?  Like...  Yeah, yeah, that's fucked up shit.  Maybe not born...  I thought he was a meddler.  Maybe not born before Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, but, you know, fresh enough where he probably  learned about this, like, relatively new president that was assassinated.  Shit.  John Opie Booth?  Is that his name?  I changed it to Wilkes a bit later.  And I've just seen this guy, and I'm like, I don't know anything about him, and there  he is on film, you know, opening up gifts with my dad's young family at the time.  I know where my grandparents, in the garage, hid their sterling silver that I stole and sold 
[02:53:00]  for drug money that I took the funds.  Oh, that's beautiful.  And my grandfather was a gambler.  He was a...  Oh, they appreciated that.  Just a complete, bad, lose-everything gambler.  Is that where you caught it?  I don't know, but I knew that about, like...  But, you know, yeah, who's going to ask questions about, you know, you don't even want to go  near them?  Silver?  What were you, the fucking 1950s with the candlesticks?  Man, see, I want these pawns, see? 
[02:53:30]  I want to get me a piece so I can knock over a bank.  There was a time...  Going in with candlesticks.  Yeah, there was a time when people actually used to eat with nice instruments, like silver  and nice plates that got handed down, and now it's like you just throw the shit in the  trash.  Plastic.  Go to a pottery barn and fucking break the shit into it.  Ben, use your fucking butter knife or a screwdriver and throw it away.  No, I kept some of the old stuff in my apartment.  Did you?  My house, I mean, yeah.  Well, you're an antique collector.  Yeah, I like that kind of shit.  You're a collector. 
[02:54:00]  Antiques.  It's much better than that fucking bullshit you get now in stores.  I guess.  Furniture.  Even houses, old houses, old Victorians and old, you know, they're just great.  That's what I like, a floor that fucking rolls like an ocean, and you put a marble on the  floor and it just rolls to a corner somewhere.  I'm not talking about old house.  You're not shooting a lot of characters.  Stairway and it's creaking.  You're not shooting pool on your floor, asshole.  Okay?  I just hate that.  A nice parquet floor is not going to fucking warm.  I like new construction. 
[02:54:30]  You're a McMansion kind of man.  That's what I am.  Drop it in, my friend.  I want the smell of new paint and new sheetrock.  We got the new production here, and then we'll get into Laszlo and we'll get into some  real tech stuff, but we got a great thing we're going to be doing very soon.  I think it's two weeks away now, unfortunately.  We're going to do it next week, but it ain't happening, right?  Yeah.  We got to change the date?  Okay.  Something we came up with yesterday.  But first, here's the new sensitive money snatch promo.  We still need women to do the money snatch.  We thought the promo was a little harsh.  It was harsh. 
[02:55:00]  It made it sound like only a loser woman would come down and do this, and we couldn't have  that, so we have a new one.  The Opie and Anthony Show is all about finding creative ways to give people who need money  a little extra money.  So we came up with the money snatch.  The money snatch is a festive little contest in which young women are invited to the studio,  placed in a room chock full of money, and whatever they manage to hold on to, they get  to keep.  So head on over to OpieAndAnthony.com or FoundryMusic.com if you want more information, and try your luck 
[02:55:30]  at the money snatch.  There is, however, one small catch.  One, you have to be totally naked.  Two, you ain't carrying that money home in your hand.  Three, if it falls out of your cooch before you make it out of the room, you're shit out of luck.  Four, no crying.  We hate that shit.  Wow, the phones are just lit with people that want to do the money snatch.  Yeah, that'll work. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  And, well, we did our lockdown for the other side of the show.  Let's see if this sounds a little better.  It's an Opie and Anthony lockdown.  It's an Opie and Anthony lockdown.  It's an Opie and Anthony lockdown.  It's an Opie and Anthony lockdown.  It's an Opie and Anthony lockdown. 
[02:56:30]  I love it.  I had to put the Steve singing in there.  That's good.  We'll use that over to the other joint.  And, finally, our new contest that's coming very soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  The Opie and Anthony show is always looking to stretch the limits of human endurance. 
[02:57:00]  So from deep within the womb of O and A labs comes So Your Pussy's Got Talent.  The Opie and Anthony Show is going to stretch, stuff, and maybe even staple a lucky vagina.  How far can one pussy go?  Eric, run! Run, you pussy!  Find out soon on The Opie and Anthony Show.  That sounds fun. It's entertaining. 
[02:57:30]  So your pussy has talent.  So your pussy's got talent.  Dude, we actually decided to do some show prep yesterday.  That's going to be a great contest.  That's what we came up with.  It's going to be terrific.  You've got to get a mom to bring her 21 or 22-old daughter in that's proud of her daughter.  No, no. We already got the slut.  Yep.  She's right there.  See, you would think that it's a competition between ladies and their vaginas.  It isn't.  We supply a vagina. 
[02:58:00]  That's the vagina that is supplied.  And then the guys have to come up with a way to use that vagina in an entertaining fashion.  Creative work.  Oh, man.  So listen, here's the deal, too.  An example was Danny.  It was brought up that he had always wanted to do Rorschach tests with an inky vagina.  You take ink, slap it on the vagina, squat it on a fucking piece of paper,  and then say, it looks like a man eating a shrimp cocktail. 
[02:58:30]  What you've got to do is get a magic act to pull a rabbit out of there.  That, too.  There you go.  A rabbit up there.  A rabbit out of there.  I think that's a winner.  That's a winner.  Anything goes.  We're looking for maybe a homemade volcano.  Yeah, where maybe she could hold her ass up.  And you could put baking soda and vinegar in there.  A little food coloring.  I'd go for Mentos and Diet Coke.  We did the Mentos.  We did the foaming pussy.  We put Mentos in the girl's pussy and some soda. 
[02:59:00]  We had to take that one back to the lab.  And had her do a headstand.  And I don't think we'd ever be allowed to do that again.  Wow.  Boy, imagine the paper having to report how that woman died.  Oh, how about fish fucking her with a Rojo Donald hand puppet?  That would be nice.  Could do that.  So, basically, the guys behind the scenes, the guys you know and love, they're like in  competition.  They're coming up with ways to use her pussy.  Ideas to use her pussy.  But I'm thinking maybe we should get a pest involved or a team of pests.  Or I like the magician idea. 
[02:59:30]  Maybe someone that thinks they could pull a unique trick with this woman's pussy.  Or make a funnel out of newspaper and pour milk into it.  And all of a sudden, you know, the milk is gone.  I like that trick.  Oh, I got one.  I got to try to get my wife to eat this girl's pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah, we were saying that.  Like, some guy that just wants to lose but doesn't care just go, I bet I can put my cock  in there and pump it back and forth until I come. 
[03:00:00]  Does she have to do anything they tell her to do?  Yeah, we hear she's a goer.  So, they'll do, you know, she'll do whatever they request.  Oh, Roman Candle.  I think we're like two weeks out.  Yes.  A little less than two weeks out.  Doesn't her big...  Your pussy's got talent.  I'm coming in just to watch.  Ross, doesn't her big second toe annoy you?  Oh, my God.  Cut that off and put that in her pussy.  Yeah, that would win.  She is kind of sexy, though.  Did you look at it, Lesley?  No, she got one of those...  Yeah, look at her... 
[03:00:30]  Ape toes.  Oh, yeah.  The second one's a lot longer.  The second one's weird.  Oh, that bugs the shit out of you.  Doesn't that bug you?  It's just it looks way too much like an orangutan.  Wow.  Here's the deal.  If a couple pests come up with a good idea, they could join So Your Pussy's Got Talent.  Yeah.  Wow.  Get a hold of Steve with your idea.  And anyone out there, we'd love an opening song for this game show.  Yeah.  Yeah, we need songs.  We need production.  We need magicians. 
[03:01:00]  So Your Pussy's Got Talent.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  Shove it in your pussy.  Something just that would fit the mood of the competition.  Has she been in the studio yet?  No.  What does she get out of this?  Ah, some plugs.  She's a slut.  A pussy full of stuff.  Slutty plugs.  Yep.  All right.  Oh, I want to see Patrice walk in with a suitcase like Dr. Mengele.  Oh, with a glass dildo. 
[03:01:30]  I know.  It's like a scene from the Marathon Man with her pussy.  We didn't talk about Goldie Hawn yet.  That's how we started the show.  Oh, with the, uh...  Yeah, the post wasn't very kind to her.  Get the picture so we can pass it around, and then maybe we'll talk about that before  we get out of here.  Laszlo's in studio.  Laszlo's doing a show tomorrow night.  That's right.  After the...  The razzle-dazzle.  Actually, it's after the razzle-dazzle.  The razzle-dazzle.  Yeah, I get bumped to the nine o'clock slop, so it's nine o'clock Eastern tomorrow night.  What's going on?  What's going on with the razzle-dazzle hour this weekend? 
[03:02:00]  Uh-oh, Keith.  Oh, no.  Now, I don't want to hear any complaining.  Oh, now, Keith decided his strategy.  Hold the phone, pally.  Okay.  Keith's strategy is, I'm going to come in with both guns blazing, and that way I can't  catch any shit.  Well, listen.  I went downstairs, and they didn't have it.  Yeah.  And then I went down the block to the other place, and they didn't have it.  Enough of that club soda, Kenny OCD shit in six degrees, all right?  Where does Kenny get the fruit?  He gets it downstairs, but they didn't have it. 
[03:02:30]  They only had mixed fruit, so I went the extra mile, and I ran down the block to Seventh  Avenue, and no, they only had mixed fruit, too.  All right, let me see that.  It's primarily...  Let me see what's in it, because there are some things I will not even have touching other...  Ooh, a couple blueberries.  Those go.  I hate blueberries.  They're blueberries.  I pronounce them like humans do.  You like that thing?  That's a kiwi.  I like a kiwi.  I like a strawberry. 
[03:03:00]  Ooh, the strawberry looks a little old, though.  A little rancid.  Don't eat that.  It's a little dark.  Look at that.  If that strawberry's bad, the whole thing's going to be bad.  Looks like a fucking kidney.  That strawberry's from Uganda.  Here.  Take my kiwi.  I'm not going to take your kiwi.  You've already cracked the seal.  I don't...  Oh, great.  That looks like a fucking abortion.  That's strawberry.  Look at this strawberry.  What the fuck is that? 
[03:03:30]  You can't eat that fruit, Ant.  You'll get sick.  I don't like the pineapple.  Let's see what's left.  I don't like that.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  Let's see what's left.  And now that's what you were looking for.  Yeah, five pieces of melon.  And a kiwi.  And a kiwi.  No, I can't eat this now, either.  What about the blueberries?  No, those will go, but I'll...  Okay, come here. 
[03:04:00]  I gotta get rid of it.  There's only three.  They really went all out.  Good thing I'm not a blueberry fan.  They gave me three.  This cantaloupe tastes like it has lead in it.  This...  Oh, great.  Oh, and then some kind of pus just came out of the blueberry.  I just did that.  It was a white, bluish pus.  Oh, Jesus.  And now I gotta eat this?  He's throwing the whole thing out after this bite.  I probably will.  Now I'm disgusted.  Two, one.  But he's hungry.  Yeah. 
[03:04:30]  Just to overlook the fact that some filthy Indian put that together three fucking days ago.  Give me the goddamn...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Fuck that.  I've had it.  Holy crap.  You know, now you're gonna get me fucking fired.  Why?  Because you know he's gonna bitch and complain when he hears what went on.  He's on a plane somewhere.  Oh, he's gonna know.  Kenny will know.  He's fucked, Cam.  He was hostile.  Kenny will know.  I am fucking disgusting.  I took a bite of the cantaloupe, and it tasted like a pineapple with rancid strawberry on 
[03:05:00]  it.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Mixed fruit.  Indeed.  Go ahead.  You eat it, Voss.  Well, there's melon juice all over the window now.  Look, see?  Isn't it awful?  Now clean it up!  Be a killer like your father.  Who's that nice yogurt for?  Oh, that's for me.  Oh, I bet.  Specially made.  Nice.  I'm stuffed.  I had a bagel at fucking three in the morning. 
[03:05:30]  What put it over the top was when he said the Indian guy prepared it three days ago.  That's what got me, Laszlo.  By the way, Laszlo got it.  That's why there's fucking shit on that window.  Why do strawberries taste like curry?  I'm sorry if I hit you, Keith, with any fruit.  All right.  Keith's used to getting hit by fruits, but then he arrests them.  Any ideas coming in for the...  He worked in the village for a while.  From the guys about your pussy's got talent?  Yeah, everybody.  Danny really is impressive with how much he hates women's vaginas. 
[03:06:00]  Why?  What has he got going so far?  Can a woman's vagina go out and get me melon?  That would win.  Where's Danny?  Your pussy's got talent.  Danny.  Yes, sir?  I think Danny pretty much indirectly came up with this idea.  Yeah.  He was going around yesterday.  Because he's fascinated with women's vaginas, but who isn't as a guy?  But he really wants to punch them.  They're not the best looking things in the world.  Well.  It's like we talk...  They're more functional.  We're back on this again.  What the fuck's wrong with you? 
[03:06:30]  Functionality.  They're perfect.  Kevin, he went off on this whole tirade about how horrible vaginas are.  Oh, I forgot about that.  I was in the room for that one, too.  They could have looked great and felt like shit.  What the fuck would you rather have?  See, that's why he knows.  I know to me, they don't...  They just...  They don't look good.  They're made for that.  Every little piece of a vagina is made to make your cock feel good.  First of all, you would never look at a pussy without fucking to go,  Oh, that was a nice pussy.  I had a good time looking at that pussy.  There's no reason. 
[03:07:00]  There are some very attractive vaginas out there.  Are you for real?  Yes.  You think they're a good looking thing?  That's the body.  Okay, this is a pussy.  I don't want to go through this again because you said...  You did hear...  Dude, you lose every time on this argument.  What?  What if you, like, cut one out with a cookie cutter or a core sampler?  What do you think?  A cock is a work of art?  You faggot.  No, I need to bring up cock.  Okay, precious.  What I said...  What I said, without the whole body...  Don't make me play the Cher song.  Without the whole body and the breast...  Johnny doesn't look good. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, without the whole package.  Just looking out of a...  What do you think?  A single tit would look good sitting on a table?  When you jerk off, if you're looking on the internet,  you're not just looking at the pussy,  you're looking at the whole thing.  I can prove your point wrong.  You ever see a really old lady naked?  You didn't get the lady naked.  Almost in Florida.  You were proving something there, Opie?  I believe you started by saying...  Almost, I made out with her.  I couldn't get her clothes off.  Opie had a great line of thought in the office  talking about vaginas, though.  We were talking about vaginas this morning. 
[03:08:00]  Imagine...  And it came from the Goldie Hawn story.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Imagine if...  I do my best work in the office, by the way.  What did you say?  Imagine if...  I just said...  Well, you have a picture of Goldie Hawn  playing tennis down there in Florida.  She's now 63.  And the headline, because the post is just hilarious,  it says,  It's Oldie Hawn.  Oldie Hawn, they called her.  Instead of Goldie Hawn.  And she looks horrible.  She looks horrific.  And I just said, you know,  imagine if God had a sense of humor 
[03:08:30]  and an old pussy,  like old lady pussy,  was the best pussy you would ever, ever had.  It would feel like just velvet  and just like...  Just...  What?  What the fuck are you talking about?  Exactly.  She's saying if.  Exactly.  If.  If you imagine if.  If.  And see, that's where...  Bitter irony.  And that's where the joke is,  because none of us would ever know  because we're just turned off by the entire pack. 
[03:09:00]  Who's gonna...  You know...  That pussy's so old and dry,  is blowing past the saloon before a gunfight.  Okay.  You know who went to a mental institution yesterday  was Shelly Long.  Yeah, I know.  I watched the inside.  Shelly Long?  Yeah.  But she's out already.  Happened to her.  She's fine.  Look at that.  Shelly Long and the tooth, they'd call her.  All right, Danny's...  Danny's back in with his ideas for you.  Danny.  He's got talent.  Holy shit.  Look at what...  There you go.  Now that's the pussy.  Eat squirrel out of the pussy. 
[03:09:30]  That's a...  That's the worst...  Look how...  Is that really his cock?  No, that's his pussy.  No, that's a woman.  That's his pussy.  So look at the whole package, Voss.  I mean...  Because you're not just looking at the pussy.  That was born a woman  and turned into a man through hormone treatment.  No fucking way.  Yes.  And he's a muscle biker dude now.  He's fucking built like...  With his original vagina.  Are you for real?  Yeah, we talked to him.  His name's Buck...  Buck Angel.  Buck Angel, yeah.  But he was a woman once.  Yeah.  A hot woman.  A pretty woman. 
[03:10:00]  Like a slight little...  Model.  She was a model.  Like an English-looking skinny model.  And you think we had a motorcycle dude.  Yeah, what the fuck drives you to that?  Holy shit.  That isn't just seeing some spaghetti  going down the wall  after your parents are arguing  and throws the spaghetti against the phone.  That was more than two days off the school.  This is a little different, yeah.  That's a fuck...  Ugh.  Yeah, we failed to mention that.  That there is a fine line  with that fucked up upbringing to...  Yeah.  Where it could have been a lot worse  where you're doing some crazier shit. 
[03:10:30]  This is a fucked up upbringing too.  Yeah.  You know what doesn't look good?  A vagina that looks like  it's been blown out from the inside.  Yeah.  Like an alien came out of it.  Like that doesn't look good.  With all the flaps hanging.  When you watch porno  and it's hanging flaps...  When it looks nice.  You know, when it's nice.  Everything's together.  When it's tucked in,  it's tight.  When it's hanging,  it looks like curtains and shit.  It's...  It's like...  You want to play tetherball. 
[03:11:00]  It's just horrible.  See?  All right, listen.  Let's get to Danny.  Danny has some ideas  for your Pussy's Got Talent.  Coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Well, I wanted to improve on  the Diet Coke and Mentos thing.  Uh-huh.  And I think I have a foolproof way  to get this done.  All right.  Safely.  With maximum volume.  Oh, okay.  So I have my plan.  That's one of my...  Now, do you know anything  about rocketry?  You might find this odd  that I'm asking,  but do you know anything 
[03:11:30]  about rocketry?  Not a whole lot, no.  Every action  has an equal and opposite reaction.  Now, a rocket works  by having a chamber  and some type of volatile material  is put into the chamber  and since there is only  one route of escape,  it comes out,  thus propelling the craft  in the opposite direction.  Now, you do understand  if you have any type  of pressure built up,  it's not just going to  come out the vagina end of it, 
[03:12:00]  it's going to also go forward  up into her womb.  Understood.  I don't think that we'll be  working with an amount  of pressure that could do  any kind of bodily damage.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm pretty confident.  It would be nice  to plug up with an IUD  type device.  That would be nice.  Then you could pack it  with dynamite.  Any flames shooting  into a pussy,  there's no such thing  as minimal...  Huh?  No flames?  This brings back memories  of us shooting  a bottle rocket  on a girl's pussy. 
[03:12:30]  We shot a bottle rocket  out of her pussy.  I think we finally got  that video up on YouTube.  It's terrific.  We were more concerned  with burning her,  so we set up heat shields  and stuff.  Yeah.  But she aimed that thing  and boom.  Boom.  All right,  what else?  Right across the room.  What else do you got  for the contest, Danny?  Well, something else  I just thought  was kind of funny.  It was basically  a huge Rube Goldberg machine  and basically on the very end  just like a big rubber finger.  So the big payoff  would just be  the finger going in 
[03:13:00]  and not even coming out.  Oh my God,  would that be beautiful.  Like the old  mousetrap games.  Like you start  by just throwing  a marble into a funnel  and there's a boot  kicking a toaster  and a string pulls  and the bowling ball  goes down  and knocks into a stick  and the stick  pushes over dominoes  and then in the end,  the payoff,  a finger just goes forward  and goes bloop  into her pussy.  Fucking brilliant, Danny.  How the hell 
[03:13:30]  are you going to  set that up?  Super genius.  I have no idea.  I'm going to film this with me.  Just sketching plans  like the coyote.  Yeah, these guys  got some competition  behind the scenes.  Danny, wow,  that would be good.  And the best execution.  Any others?  What a payoff  that would be  if it works.  You have to have one.  You're a creative guy.  Yeah, I'm just not.  I'm approaching this  from a whole other place  than Danny.  Yeah.  Like, for instance,  we gave, like,  there's sort of like  a standing order  for everybody  to think of bits  and contests. 
[03:14:00]  And Danny had  five pussy-related ones  in the bank already.  Oh, already.  Oh, okay.  So, like,  you're just kind of  pulling these out to you.  So we're all  a little frightened  by Danny's fascination  with the subject.  But yeah, we'll all try.  Anyone else out there  have an idea  they want to bring  to the table yet?  Bill has one?  All right, Bill.  I bet it involves  a hatchet.  Yeah.  I have one.  I had one like Danny's,  but then I have  my main one,  which is she puts  a bottle of milk  in her pussy,  and Eric has to wear  a bonnet and drink it 
[03:14:30]  like a baby.  And he's in a diaper.  And he has to keep going,  I'm Eric Nagel,  the producer  of the Hoopy and Anthony show.  And then she goes,  you're a bad boy.  And he has to  suck it from him.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you?  All he wanted to do  was bash Iraq.  And he did it.  Oh, is that hysterical?  Oh, no way.  I'm Eric Nagel  and I'm a bad boy.  With a bonnet on. 
[03:15:00]  Holy fuck.  God, those guys hate you.  Yeah.  Whose idea was that?  Bill's.  Bill.  Do you have an idea  for the pussy, Rock?  I have elements,  I just don't know  how to construct it yet.  Everyone's involved,  you know?  Yeah.  Well, we're going to get  some nice money up  for these guys.  The best idea  and best execution  will win the money.  See, I'd love to be involved  with something like this.  Why does the staff  get the fun?  Dude, you can go for one.  Can I, I think,  is that something?  Yeah.  That'd be fun.  You know,  somebody's talking 
[03:15:30]  with a turban,  somebody's clit's  getting cut off.  Yeah.  Circumcision African style.  Steve, you have one yet?  The spade shovel.  Steve, you working on an idea  for your Pussy's Got Talent?  Yeah.  I put on Boxing Globe.  I knock the bitch out.  I just had a brief one.  I just, I'm not sure  if it's going to work,  but maybe making the drink,  the Irish car bomb.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Irish car bomb.  Very nice.  And then drink,  there should be some kind  of points for utilization 
[03:16:00]  of the anus as well.  Oh, if you want to,  I wonder if you could use  the anus as a peripheral thing,  an anchor point.  Anchor down some apparatuses  for your,  get those false teeth  that go like this  and make her pussy eat corn.  Or, wow,  utilizing the anus.  I'm digging this.  Hold on.  How about this?  You take one of those things.  You know those things  in the office,  in an office,  in the,  usually the boss's desk,  the metal balls  that go tick, 
[03:16:30]  tick, tick.  Yeah.  You take two of them,  tie them to strings,  one's to a butt plug,  one's to a little vagina.  You shove one up her ass,  one up her pussy.  She spreads her legs  and you go click,  click,  click,  and turn her into  one of those  human fucking office  stress relieving visual things.  Nice.  It utilizes the ass,  the vagina,  and they're always fun to watch.  Fast Freddy has a good one.  My idea,  I want to put as many  gumballs in her twat,  as many as she can handle.  The contestants,  U-Tools, 
[03:17:00]  guess how many,  oh,  it should be closest,  I guess.  Guess how many closest,  without going over the wind,  closest to how many  are in there.  How about Chubby Cunty?  Chubby Cunty,  where she's got to  shove marshmallows in,  take some cock,  and then...  I thought your idea  was the Wii.  No,  that was,  again,  Danny's.  Danny's idea  with the Wii.  What was that one,  Danny?  Well,  basically,  like,  actual details  haven't really been 
[03:17:30]  worked out too far,  but get one of those  Wii controllers  and or nunchucks  and shove it in a chick  and make her play video games.  Make her play the Wii  with her pussy  holding the controller,  controlling a sword  or a tennis racket  or something.  He's practicing on somebody.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  All right.  More ideas will come  to the table next week,  I'm sure,  after the long weekend.  I've got one.  You put a whole bunch  of liquid up her snatch,  some kind of colorful liquid,  and then you make her do  that fucking  Dance Dance Revolution game.  Um,  that was another one 
[03:18:00]  of Danny's ideas.  God fucking...  Oh,  here it is.  Wait,  wait,  wait.  Wasn't that different,  though?  That was...  That was the...  That was,  uh...  I think Steve actually  named it  Lax Lax Revolution.  Yeah.  When you have enemas.  Or Dance Dance Diarrhea.  This is what you do.  You put a little thing  in her butt  and put paint in her beaver  and you make her spin  with a paint shooting out  and it makes one of those  things that you used  to do at the carnival.  Like a sit and spin.  Yeah,  but you used to...  Spin art.  Yeah.  Spin art out of a pussy. 
[03:18:30]  Hmm.  That's tough to pull off,  but you're thinking.  I like it.  Yeah,  if you put a thin,  like pencil-thin thing  up her ass  that held a,  uh,  uh,  little disc,  a white disc,  and then you spin the disc  and she then discharges  the liquid,  it would look like spin art.  Yeah.  Wow,  that's pretty good.  All right,  well,  it's a competition  and,  uh,  we can get the listeners involved.  We'll accept the,  we'll accept the really good,  uh, 
[03:19:00]  idea from the past.  And the name of the contest?  Your pussy's got talent.  Your pussy's got talent.  So,  yeah.  So,  so your pussy's got talent.  Right.  So your pussy's got talent.  Right,  right,  right.  It's got to be worded perfectly.  Of course.  I feel sick from that fruit.  Huh?  I feel really sick from that.  Already?  Fermenting in your stomach?  You just had a bite.  It won't hurt you.  It's like the,  where you had to get,  where you don't have food in you  and you feel the sickness  inside of you?  Yeah,  it's fermentation.  It's what it's doing.  It's not the matter  with the fruit.  It's fine.  You'll eat, 
[03:19:30]  yeah,  like,  he is so fucking pissed right now.  I just need other food  in my food.  It's fine.  It's fine.  All right.  We've got to get  to some tech stuff.  It really isn't good.  I'm thinking we should just let,  it probably won't make you sick,  but it just doesn't taste good.  Yeah,  Anthony and I were talking  about the,  uh,  Fox trying to put the kibosh  on,  what is it,  24?  24.  Full episodes up on,  uh,  YouTube.  And the Simpsons,  and it's,  they've got to realize  the cat's out of the bag.  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  I mean,  you are not going to stop people  from posting TV shows.  And if you think about 24,  somebody's not just going to  watch one episode  and be like,  all right,  we're done.  Yeah.  No,  they're going to want to watch  the rest of them.  It's nothing but promotion  for the show.  Yeah.  That's what they don't understand.  They don't understand  that the cat's out of the bag thing.  You know,  it's been released.  There's no putting it back.  Well,  here,  here's the problem where we're having  a similar problem.  They don't know,  they don't know how to make it work  for them because they,  they,  they based their whole business plan 
[03:20:30]  on getting really good ratings,  TV ratings for their shows.  So they figure if you're going to  watch it another way,  even though there's a lot of people  watching your show,  the numbers are not showing that.  So the advertisers are not buying  commercial commercials,  kind of like with Ann and I,  we've kind of spread ourselves  too thin.  There's too many ways to listen  to the Opie and Anthony show,  but it's too late.  Like you said,  it's out there.  It's too late.  So that's the problem  because they are getting  huge audiences watching their shows,  but not in the old school way  of just the dumb Nielsen ratings. 
[03:21:00]  But who actually sits down  and watches 24 real time?  Especially when they leave  that cliffhanger.  I got to be able to hit bump,  bump,  bump,  I completely agree with you,  but it's the old farts  that are much higher in the chain  than you and I  that can't figure out  a new way to look at things.  Fox actually has a guy  called a privacy czar yesterday.  A czar.  Yeah,  I think the title czar  should have been retired years ago.  Do they come up to somebody at Fox  and be like,  by the way,  you're the new czar.  It's like,  fuck,  now I've got to get  like a gold tooth and a cat. 
[03:21:30]  I'm a czar.  Fuck.  Petting the cat slowly.  I got to blow up  a city block in Columbia.  You want to smell something awful?  No,  I'm not fucking,  I've listened to the show  a long time.  I'm not fucking smelling  that shit behind you guys.  This ear behind you.  All right,  hold on,  let's get,  it's really bad today.  I thought you had it  taken care of.  This year I had it taken care of,  not this one yet.  Who hasn't smelled it yet?  That new kid  right there  going to get food.  Who?  Oh great,  he's going to get food. 
[03:22:00]  That one right there  with the pants  that you may sit in here.  Oh,  Eric Nagel?  No,  no,  no.  Right there,  the jackass  that was supposed  to get my turkey burger  an hour ago.  All right,  bring him in.  Jackass.  Bring him in.  Who is it?  What's his name?  All right,  go ahead,  Laszlo.  That was an excuse  to get the dummy  out of the room.  Fox is the,  they're even trying  to put the kibosh  in all those clips  breaks got him  of Paula Abdul  all like half shit faced.  Yeah,  yeah.  They're trying to, 
[03:22:30]  they're like threatening  people with lawsuits  for posting clips  which were broadcast  over the air  on Fox news stations  nationwide  and people are posting  those online  and Fox is going bananas  and saying that it's  a violation of the  Digital Millennium  Copyright Act.  That sounds serious.  It's like,  give me a fucking break.  Instead of like  trying to come up  with laws to stop  all this because  like you said,  it's too late,  you gotta start  thinking differently.  You have to adapt  to the situation.  You gotta get a new  business plan.  I mean,  the record industry  finally figured it out. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah,  sell them online.  Remember they were  trying to shut down  freaking downloading  a music?  Yeah,  I love the record industry  when they fought  the iPod.  It's like,  it's really gonna work  well for you there.  Yeah.  But how stupid were they?  Like,  but their thinking  is so outdated  and they tried  to outlaw the VCR.  I mean,  these are the same people  that tried to make  the VCR illegal  and then they made  a fortune.  These guys make  massive decisions  and they just don't  understand what's going  on in the world.  around them.  They got lazy  a long time ago  and what happened? 
[03:23:30]  Okay,  thank you.  Who's that?  Bye.  Who's that,  Ian?  I have my doctor's  appointment at the one  they're confirming  for a Monday.  They take blood  and take my cholesterol.  Oh, yummy,  yummy,  yummy.  It's 75.  Can they maybe wait  like six months  to take this?  That would be nice.  All right.  Where were we?  Okay,  yeah,  go ahead,  Laszlo.  So they're trying 
[03:24:00]  to get rid  of the clips  of Paula Abdul.  Yeah,  those ones  of her  half shit-faced.  And what you do,  they call it  the Streisand effect.  There's a ton  of blogs  that are sort of  babbling about this  now.  The more you try  to put the kibosh  on it,  the more publicity  you get.  Like,  oh,  I didn't hear  about that.  Let me go  check out  what a tool she is.  Yeah.  And have you seen,  speaking of YouTube,  the video for the song  Sweep the Leg Johnny?  No,  what's that? 
[03:24:30]  Have you seen  that one yet?  It's a band  has a song.  It's like Sweep the Leg Johnny.  And the video  is hysterical.  It's got all the guys  from the Karate Kid  are in it,  but they're all old now  and it's really them.  And they're like  in the trailer park  and all they do  is sit around  and watch Karate Kid.  And the guys,  the head guy,  Johnny,  his wife or girlfriend  or whatever it is,  comes walking  and he goes,  what are you doing?  Like,  again, 
[03:25:00]  you watch this movie  every day  and he's like,  you know,  just leave me alone  and his friends  are goofing on.  Like,  you shouldn't let her  talk to you like that.  Like,  they're all still together  and the band  kind of comes in.  Is it the real guys?  Yeah,  no,  it's the real guys.  No kidding.  It's all the real guys.  And the sensei  and everything  is in it  and Ralph Macchio  has a little appearance  at the end  and I found it  very funny  and the song  kind of gets stuck  in your head.  It's really  dopey-ass song,  but the video  is done very well. 
[03:25:30]  It was written,  the video was written  and directed  by Johnny,  whatever his real name is.  Now we gotta check this out.  Yeah.  It's pretty funny,  that big karate scene.  It ends up  at the tournament  where he's fighting the guy.  It's pretty funny.  Matt from Boston,  hope you don't know shit  about TV ratings.  A2M2 is Nielsen's new campaign  to measure media  anywhere,  anytime,  dumbass.  Yeah.  I guess that's like  the people meter  for radio.  A2M2.  What? 
[03:26:00]  Huh?  Who the...  The thing that,  it's just the same system  but electronically.  They are keeping tabs  if people are watching  the shows DVR'd.  Right.  If you're one of these  like families  that have the,  what used to be  the Nielsen box.  Sorry, sir.  I don't know  what it's called these days.  They're gonna have to just  integrate the advertising  in the shows even more,  kind of like the old days  because they know  people aren't fucking  DVRing  and watching commercials 
[03:26:30]  ever.  I'll tell you what works.  You're fast-forwarding  through commercials.  They put a quick  two-frame message in.  You ever see these commercials  where it's like...  I haven't seen it yet.  No.  Yeah, like it's for Coke  or something  and they're drinking  and then it's like,  here's something you didn't know.  Boom!  Two seconds.  Boom!  Something's up there.  And you're like,  oh, so even fast-forwarding  you see something flash  with all these words on it  and then you gotta stop,  rewind,  and then pause it  to read the whole thing.  And then you're getting  the message that they want 
[03:27:00]  you to read  and stay in kind of a...  Huh.  They're having to completely  change TV commercials  just in the hope  that you'll get  a two-second impression  of the logo on the screen  as you're blasting through.  Anything.  But the whole concept of ratings,  it's done.  The channel is done.  I don't give a fuck  what channel 24 is on  or Battlestar Galactica  or any of it.  Yeah, you can.  I want it fucking on demand.  As soon as I sit down,  I want it to be there  and watch it.  Yeah, when I want to watch it, 
[03:27:30]  how many I want to watch in a row.  That's obviously  where this should be  at this point in time.  But it fucks with advertisers.  Yeah, they haven't figured out  the advertising angle yet.  That's the only reason.  The thing that pays  to have the show made  are the commercials,  the advertisers.  So there's got to be  another revenue stream  which would be  the people then  buying the shows on demand.  Right.  Buying the DVD box set.  You buy it once.  Wouldn't you pay  just a couple bucks  just to see  your favorite episode 
[03:28:00]  anytime you want?  Yeah, that's what people  are doing with iTunes.  Then how do product...  But I'm talking about  right on the freaking TV.  Right on the TV.  American Idol,  I can't stay up that late.  I want to watch it.  Boom, here it is.  I'll pay this $2.  Not even so much  how are the shows  going to be made.  They'll figure out ways  to get money  because we...  They made Rome.  That cost like $100 million  or some shit  to make that show.  Here it is.  If we want to see it,  they'll figure out a way  to bill us for it.  We'll pay for it.  But here's the question. 
[03:28:30]  How will products  be advertised?  How are you going to now  advertise for  a product?  No one's watching anymore.  Wait, Opie raised his hand.  It's Professor Anthony Rich.  Opie, naked women?  At the...  And...  Yes, it is.  Naked women.  Wow, I didn't even...  The vagina wins again.  You want...  People start watching  commercials again?  Nudity.  Simple as that.  You think it's just  going to be nude commercials?  At the Consumer Electronics Show, 
[03:29:00]  Bill Gates made this announcement  about the Xbox and IPTV.  That's where you get...  If they're putting commercials  on your fucking games.  Internet...  Oh, dude, that's already  a whole fucking...  There's product placement  in video games.  Business model.  So that's a way  of doing it, I guess.  They've already done  some research that people  aren't paying any attention  to them, even in the games,  which I fucking love.  But if you're playing  like a first-person shooter,  you know?  Like if I'm playing  Call of Duty 2  and there's a fucking Coca-Cola  ad in the middle of Germany...  That's true.  You're not going to...  Well, you know something, though? 
[03:29:30]  But it's just like a billboard.  You're in a virtual world.  You're in a real-life world  and you see a billboard.  Did you ever think, like,  oh, I saw that product.  I want to get it right now?  No, it's just impressions.  But they've been using them  for years, so obviously  they found it has to work.  Yeah, it makes sense  in the sports games  and like the racing games  and things like  where you're used to  seeing a million logos.  You know what, though?  Let me tell you what you're doing  in the first-person shooter thing.  You make your own tags.  And you know how you go up  on the wall  and you spray paint your own tag  and it's usually your own symbol  or something like that? 
[03:30:00]  And that's kind of,  it looks like a billboard.  You take a porno picture  and make that your tag.  I've done this before.  Go into a room,  spray it on the wall,  and then just stand back.  People will run up to it  and just stand there  staring at it  and you throw a fucking grenade  at the crowd.  It is a scream.  It works every fucking time.  What a great idea.  It's a little 13-year-old kid  looking at just hardcore porno  that I just sprayed on the wall 
[03:30:30]  and they walk up and look  and they're just standing there  and you see that character  slightly tipped up looking at it  and you just throw a grenade  into the crowd of them.  Boom.  Pwned.  Porned.  All right,  so what else we got?  Bill Gates,  he's talking about doing  like IPTV through the Xbox  because he wants it to be  like an entertainment hub.  Yeah.  But some of the things  that he's touting  is that you can insert ads  that are up to date  because the thing  that they have a problem  with the DVR  is you'll record like, 
[03:31:00]  you know,  three or four episodes  of a show.  The commercials  from a month ago  aren't as relevant  as the ones  that they're trying  to make you watch today.  Yeah,  we were watching stuff  the other day  because we'll tape  entire reality series  first episode  to the last episode  without watching one  and then spend  a Saturday or something  during the day  laying around in bed  doing a marathon.  Watch the whole  frigging series.  You don't have to wait.  You don't have to worry  that, you know,  there's a next week  what happens  with a cliffhanger.  You watch everything  all at once. 
[03:31:30]  And yeah,  we fast forward  through every commercial  and you see  Christmas commercials  going on  and, you know,  Thanksgiving commercials  are going on  with the July 6th.  It's really irrelevant.  When you tape it,  like when we tape it,  doesn't it erase it  after a week  or two weeks  or something?  No,  you do the setting  to keep until  you erase.  Now,  are you using  the six-hour setting  on the VHS?  I don't do it.  My wife does it.  Do you do it  on a VCR tape?  No,  we do it on TiVo.  Oh, TiVo.  My wife does it.  I don't do that.  All right. 
[03:32:00]  Of course.  You don't do the TiVo.  That's beneath.  And now,  you're going to advertise  most,  now it's going to go  to movie theaters.  That's where they're  going to start doing  a lot of it.  They do it already  before the movie starts.  Commercials in movie theaters?  40 minutes.  When's that going to happen?  Yeah.  It's already started.  No shit.  Oh, really?  When?  I don't know exactly when.  I don't have the date,  but I know it's been going  for a couple of years.  Not during the fucking movie.  No,  before the movie.  Yeah.  You see cold commercials  and stuff.  Yeah.  Right?  Huh.  I wait for the movie  to start  and I walk into the theater.  Yeah,  you don't sit through 
[03:32:30]  that shit.  They're even talking  about restricting  ad skipping.  If they start selling  this TV-on-demand services,  and I'm sure the PS3  is going to do the same thing  because it's too lucrative  of a market,  but Bill Gates  is actually saying  we'll be able  to control people's  ability to skip ads.  Yeah.  And the other thing  is if you don't have those...  And you know what?  There's a company right now  figuring out how  to get around that.  It's like the old  fucking arms race.  You ever put a DVD in  and you try to fast forward  through something  at the beginning  of the FBI warning  and the red hand  comes up like, 
[03:33:00]  stop!  You will not fast forward  through this FBI warning.  Hey, attention!  That's what's going to happen  with the commercials.  You're going to try  to fast forward  and it's going to tell you now.  If it gets so annoying  then there's going to be  a company out there  going, wow,  there's a market for this.  We've got to come up  with another machine  or another way around it.  The more they can move things  to an on-demand environment,  the more content control  they have  because when you record  stuff to a hard drive,  it's not difficult  to hack a TiVo  or any kind of DVR  and have it...  I mean, I know guys  that as soon as  they record a show, 
[03:33:30]  it's pulled off  the hard drive  of their TiVo,  it's available  on their iPod,  it's all over  their personal network.  That kind of sharing  being able to watch  stuff that you've paid for  is not what the  entertainment industry  is interested in.  You see the new  Windows Media Center?  Yes, and they've got  the home server now too.  Now, I hooked  my cable box up to it  and I could watch  anything on my  cable system,  the on-demand,  everything,  on my computer.  and then you take  Snagit and you just 
[03:34:00]  grab the frame  and you have it.  Anything.  Any movie  that's on-demand,  anything.  DVD is the same way.  Pop a DVD in,  pop it up on that  and copy it  with no problem.  TV shows.  So, you know,  that's one of those  things that,  oops,  look at the ability  you gave us  with this little  fucking gizmo.  Snagit is nice.  Snagit,  I love Snagit.  Use it all the time.  What else we got there, 
[03:34:30]  Laz?  Well, the other thing,  speaking of Snagit,  there's a lot of,  people forget that  there's actually  free television  out there still  and there's,  free?  Yeah, it travels  through the air.  Through the airways?  When I see like  those old school  TV antennas  on top of houses,  I'm like,  why do you still  have that up there?  What is that thing?  What are you doing  with that weird contraption?  But since terrestrial  TV stations  are switching to HD,  you can now get  a USB device  that you just  stick on the side  of your laptop  and if you're  sitting in your  hotel room  in Phoenix  or wherever, 
[03:35:00]  you can sit there  and watch television.  It'll receive  digital television  over the air.  Over the air  for free.  It costs you nothing.  So you get  your basic channels.  Yeah,  they're like 75 bucks,  80 bucks  for the USB device  to put in your laptop  and as long as  you're in a major city  or near a major station,  you'll be able  to watch it.  Why would you have,  wouldn't the hotel  have a TV?  Why would you do that  in your computer  to watch the TV?  Well,  maybe not a hotel.  Because in your hotel room,  you're not going  to be able to TVO it.  You could have  your laptop sitting 
[03:35:30]  there recording  your shows.  And you get  a better picture too.  Most TVs in hotels  stink.  Or if you're out  in the middle  of the wilderness,  want to watch  a little TV  between hunting.  The one thing  that Ann and I  wanted to bring up  a few days ago  and you got it  on your list here  is betting on horse  races from your phone  legally.  Yeah,  I love how  we never got  to this story.  It drove us nuts.  It was in the paper  the other day.  They're shutting down  the fucking poker rooms  where even I enjoy  going on those things  every once in a while  and I'm not a massive gambler. 
[03:36:00]  It was just a great way  to blow off some steam  and no one's getting hurt  and they're shutting  them all down.  But we read this cute  little story  you can still bet  on horses.  There was a beautiful  loophole when they  rammed through  all that recent stuff  making it a lot more  difficult for people  to play poker  and actually moving  websites that were  pretty decent  reputable  to even farther  off into the periphery  of sort of like  weird, sketchy  is this an okay place  for me to be wiring  money to  kind of place. 
[03:36:30]  When they did that  they put these nice  loopholes in for lotteries  and for horse racing  and horse racing  is in trouble  because younger  demographics don't  really...  Now that's the  old man sport.  Right, exactly.  I mean you can still  go to bars here  in New York City  and there's old men  sitting at the edge  smoking cigarettes  you know, fuck  the no smoking law  betting on the horses.  And we bring this  up all the time  you know, the government  acts like they're  trying to protect you  and stuff, blah blah blah  they didn't know  how to make the money  off the online poker  that's the only reason  they shut it down. 
[03:37:00]  Because other countries  are running them  offshore.  Right, and they're not  getting that revenue  so it's like, you know  what, fuck you all.  They can't tax them.  When the mafia  was running numbers  it's like, that is immoral  we're going to have  the lotto.  Yeah, this is a lottery  same thing but  same fucking thing.  We tax it.  But I get so insulted  when they go on TV  oh, we're trying  to protect the children  we're trying to protect  the citizens of this  great blah blah blah  People, there's no  checking of ages  and we know of  high school children  that were gambling  online and playing 
[03:37:30]  poker and  what's to prevent them  from opening up  an account the same way  and betting on the  horses over their  telephones.  Right.  Yeah, they're  developing these  applets for  BlackBerrys  for mobile phones  that you can  download and then  get real-time stats  and place bets  on horse races  and they think  this is a great way  to sort of get  horse racing  to younger  demographics.  To the future.  To the future.  That kind of  sounds cool.  I bet on an  occasional  Yeah, what the fuck?  I'd box some shit  in on an Xacto 
[03:38:00]  whatever that is.  Come on.  And finally,  this is coming out  of Philly.  This was in the  paper today and we  didn't get to  really talk about it.  The casino.  There's been a couple  of casinos  nationwide.  I've seen these  stories popping up  that the old  slot machine that  had a bunch of  sort of like  moving parts  and gears and  those things are  done.  It's all like  computerized,  hooked up to a  central server  somewhere.  These things are  having glitches  now and not only  is it glitching,  people are sitting  in front of it,  they put their  50 cents or a  dollar in and 
[03:38:30]  they pull the  handle or they  hit the button  and the thing  goes fucking  bananas and says  you've won $102,000  which was the case  of this guy at  this place outside  of Philly.  It's a brand new  casino down there.  He's ecstatic,  he's thinking about  all the shit that  he's going to buy  and they come over  and they're like,  oh we had a little  bit of a computer  error.  Here's a couple  of tickets.  They literally  gave him...  $100.  $100 and meal  tickets.  Buffet.  For the buffet.  He's going to get  his money.  Oh he'll get it.  I don't know.  He was all over  TV this morning,  he is not happy.  Casinos pretty much  do as they want. 
[03:39:00]  And yeah,  that was based  on some kind  of computer glitch  I guess.  I don't know  how they figured  it out.  What did they...  They must have  realized that it  wasn't time  for this machine  to pay off.  Yeah.  Or perhaps somebody  was servicing  one of the servers  and hit something  and went like,  oh shit,  I fucking just  paid out this guy  the prize.  But they can say  that anytime.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Oh we were running  through a test.  What happened?  It's a new casino  down there  that no one  knows about. 
[03:39:30]  They should  fucking pay  the guys  100 grand  and make a big  deal about it  in the news.  And get their  money back  from the advertising.  Get the publicity  from it.  Casinos are such  like a weird  dark arts  kind of thing.  And now that  they've brought  computers in  it's just like  you hear about  these back rooms  that have just  these massive servers  and you know  it's like  what's to keep  somebody from  they can  control the payouts.  Yeah.  You know that  they can do that.  They can control  the payouts  from these computers.  What's to make  you think  that there's not  some asshole  watching you  on the camera  he's like 
[03:40:00]  you know what  that guy has  long hair  I think he's  a fag.  You don't win  tonight buddy.  You're not winning.  Yeah.  Let's see  you might as well  go play fucking  cards.  Yeah.  When you're dealing  with real people  that's one thing  but when you put  the machines  in there  that gets sketchy.  That's why  I don't like  the video poker  at the casinos  and things like that.  Ever since  gambling in casinos  slots were the  biggest sucker bet  in the casino.  That's the biggest  sucker.  You know all  these old ladies  come in  and it's the 
[03:40:30]  biggest money maker.  Yeah.  You know.  You get a lot  of cash.  You know I still  don't understand  the sling box  Laszlo.  Oh the sling box  basically hooks up  to your home  entertainment center  and it takes  whatever is on  your TiVo  or on your TV  feed right.  You can tune  to Channel 4  in New York  or whatever  and you've got  your laptop  and you're in  Vegas and you  want to watch  the local TV  news.  It streams  your shows  from your 
[03:41:00]  home entertainment  center through  your internet  connection across  the internet  to your laptop.  So and they're  hoping to put the  kibosh on that  whole thing too.  Why?  Well because you're  not paying for  things two or three  times.  That's the new  revenue model of  the entertainment  industry.  But we were out  there in Vegas and  our big big big big  boss was supporting  that.  Was he?  Yeah right?  Being able to  play shit.  They were talking  about it.  They fought time  shifting.  It was part of  his presentation  like to kind of 
[03:41:30]  embrace the new  media including  Slingbox and all  this other stuff.  That's my biggest  beef with the  mobile phone  providers in this  country is they  are fighting and  locking down and  cripple wear on  phones left and  right to prevent  them from being  what they are.  A mobile phone is  now a handheld  computer and it's  getting internet  access and you  should be able to  access anything  that's on the  internet with your  phone and not be  told by Verizon  you got to pay an  extra five dollars to 
[03:42:00]  access YouTube.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Well on my phone I  put this thing like  when you go into a  hotel like to get  online it's like ten  dollars a day this  and that but I have  a thing where I  download this is a  modem where I plug  my computer into this  phone and I can get  online anywhere.  Is that a briefcase  phone that you have  there?  No you see what I'm  saying?  You have to plug that  into hold on.  Wait listen.  You have to wait  wait wait wait.  You have to plug that  into something and  then you get online?  No will you listen  to me?  I'm listening. 
[03:42:30]  I go to the computer  to the phone.  Yeah.  I go to this I plug  it in the cable from  here to the computer  right and I go to  this thing I know  pda.net right and  then it comes up  online and I get  online on my  computer okay without  having to pay the  service fees in the  hotel like $10 a day  or $15 a day.  Oh I got you.  So this is I guess  a modem.  An air card.  You ever seen an  air card from  Verizon?  You slap it in  instead of a wire 
[03:43:00]  going to do you get  internet on that?  Yeah I get internet on  this but you can't get  to certain sites you  know you can't.  Oh WAP right.  I hate WAP.  You know what's it I  can't see it on here.  You know I get you  call tech support a lot.  Tech support you know.  Oh are you saying I  don't know?  No I'm just I just  know I don't do it.  Just be honest say yes  or saying you don't know.  No I used to I used to  but now I only go to  like four or five sites.  And none of them about  vaginas?  No.  All right.  All right.  Laszlo's going to be on 
[03:43:30]  tomorrow night?  That's right the Laszlo  show is after the  Razzle Dazzle Hour.  After the Razzle Dazzle  Razzle Dazzle.  Hopefully there'll be  some more people.  What are we going to  hear on the Razzle  Dazzle Hour tomorrow?  It's another episode of  the Musical Adventure  Hour.  Oh that's right.  I enjoyed that.  Featuring Danny this  week.  Danny.  Very good.  Well how can you even  goof on it then?  Because it's just going  to be so fucking cool.  It's pretty un-goofable.  Yeah.  Un-goofable music.  Dude when did we  shave your head? 
[03:44:00]  It was like months ago.  What?  To me it was like  last week.  I just realized  your head was going  back in.  How long ago was  that?  That was a solid  probably two or  three months.  It was before  Christmas right?  Yeah.  All right.  Actually I think it  was might have been  around Thanksgiving.  I think it was the  day before Thanksgiving  I'll tell you the truth.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Are you guys going  to have a charity  auction?  Because E-Rock  had me bring a ton  of shit from I got  like bully stuff.  I wanted to bring  this up. 
[03:44:30]  E-Rock has every  celebrity that comes  in here sign  various stuff  and says  sir would you sign  this for our  charity auction?  And then they go  like yeah.  And anybody that's  in here is signing  all their DVDs  and books and  shit.  And I don't know  what the fuck he's  talking about.  Is he waiting for  another 9-11?  So that you can  like come save the  day?  Yeah we're waiting  for a disaster.  I got a Scarface  poster signed.  We're waiting for a  fucking disaster to  happen.  Either that or  E-Rock's like moving  on up. 
[03:45:00]  Because I brought  like a nice bunch  of stuff from Bully  the game that Jim  Norton was in and  Vice City Stories  which everybody here  was in.  I just signed a  bunch of covers  of Vice City Stories.  Dude you guys got  you got to dumb  down Grand Theft Auto.  What?  No one's getting to  the end of these  games.  We were talking  about this the other  day.  I don't like a  dumb down though.  Yeah a little bit  though.  I would say like  less than 2% of the  people like playing  you know Vice City  Stories of the PSP  are actually going  to the end.  They can sometimes  be challenging.  You know what got  them?  What?  Helicopter. 
[03:45:30]  Helicopter nailed  him.  Nailed him.  I couldn't do it.  What shooting out  of the helicopter?  No you got to  land on the car as  it's moving to.  It's just like fuck  this.  I got the first  Grand Theft Auto.  I can't get over the  wall in the beginning.  You know what I'm  talking about?  How do you get over  the wall?  What are you playing  that thing on?  Oh my god.  I got my 486.  I can't get over the  wall.  Playing it on it  lags a bit.  Which Grand Theft  Auto?  I don't know.  I went into one of  those stores.  I saw it on sale  used.  GTA the original  overhead view one.  Yeah the guy runs  into the alley and I 
[03:46:00]  can't get over this  wall so I stopped  playing.  You reach the  boundary of the  game.  Do you typically  play games until  you finish them?  Not typically but  usually I'll finish  a game.  There are some I  won't.  Some I even like  that I don't finish  for some reason.  I find a new game  or something like  that.  GTA I have to  if I start a  mission I got to  finish it.  I can't just even  though there's 20  other phones ringing  my pages going off  like I could take  another mission or 
[03:46:30]  something I got to  finish the one.  I got to tell you  the bitchiest one I  ever fucking did was  that god damn  helicopter that you  had to take the  remote control one  into the building.  That was rough.  And put out the  disarm the bomb  thing.  I got that done.  That was in the  last verse.  You know how I had  to do that?  I had to hook up  my joystick to the  computer I did on  PC not a gaming  platform and hook  my joystick up and  set it in all the  presets and fly the  thing like a real  fucking helicopter and  it was the only way I 
[03:47:00]  could do it.  I had to completely  almost cheat I guess  and use different  peripherals.  Because the guys you  got testing the games  of course they're  going to have a lot  more skills in the  out of Joe.  I don't want to  walk through the  whole thing.  No.  There's a fine  balance.  That's all I'm  saying.  You're not doing  it with the  fucking WSAD  keys flying that  fucking helicopter  through that  building.  I really enjoyed  Vice City Stories.  I thought they  updated very nicely  and then I really  want to play some  more and I was  like I just can't  do this mission.  Fuck it. 
[03:47:30]  And then I even  tried with cheat  codes and I can't  fucking do it.  Cheater.  Oh yeah.  I'll cheat.  Do you want me to  get you through the  level?  I can play it.  It's not a bad  idea.  It's not a bad  idea.  You know what I  hate about I'll  tell you what I  hate about it and  the ones that I  can't get through  the fucking races  when you got a  race a computer  the computer knows  how to cut every  corner.  It's not going to  spin out.  It's not going to  fucking get chased  by the cops.  It's not going to  do anything and  I'm like flying  smashing into  poles.  You see him off 
[03:48:00]  in the horizon  somewhere and you  just know the race  is over.  The ATV.  I've tried blocking  I've tried getting  cheat codes and  blocking the course  with tanks so I  can like get  around first and  then smash it and  the tanks are gone  by the time I get  there and go wait  I put him there.  What about the  ATV race through the  trailer park?  That was brutal.  That was brutal.  I'm rocking and all  of a sudden I hit  one stupid bump and  I'm like flying through  the air.  I'm all over the  place.  I land on one wheel  and boom boom boom  when you actually 
[03:48:30]  complete it.  You feel so good.  You feel like a  fucking gun.  I did complete that  one.  I'm proud to say I  finally got through  that one.  You get through and  then you're all  paranoid get back to  the safe house and  save it for God's  sake.  Don't fuck up now.  See your battery  light blinking.  Yeah.  That's the worst.  Did I put my  safe card in?  Oh shit.  I've done that where  all of a sudden you  get through a really  hard mission and you're  going back to the  safe house and then  all of a sudden you  hit a cop car like  oh fuck it.  And it's one star and  you know you can  outrun that. 
[03:49:00]  Your car's smoking.  If it takes one  little ding it's on  fire.  All of a sudden it's  like what happened?  I'm just going back  to the safe house and  you don't even know  how you got in this  position.  All of a sudden it's  like a five star  alert and the SWAT  team's coming out of  the sky.  You're like stopping  at red lights.  A lot of people on  the way back to the  safe house they're always  like stopping at the  red lights.  Don't hit anybody.  Gotta be nice.  I hope that's not too  inside.  That's funny.  Are you kidding?  Everyone's played that  fucking game.  Yeah okay good.  Anyone who hasn't  played that game tune 
[03:49:30]  out.  You're not in the  demo.  Please.  Hey you know what's  cool about Grand  Theft Auto Vice City  stories?  A little slight bug.  You go into the  mall.  You get a five six  star you know alert  going and you never  die because they can't  get inside the mall.  Yeah he was.  Kenny was telling me  about that.  And it gets creepy  because now you just  feel like you're one of  these you know like I  hate to say it but  school shooters.  You're just killing  everything in sight.  And I was saying to  Kenny why didn't you  guys when you were on  the plane. 
[03:50:00]  What was Keith  Kenny?  Keith Kenny.  Whatever.  Kenny's the guy that  gets the good melon.  Right.  Keith is the guy that  fucks it up.  But he gets  Lamborghinis.  Now because you guys  were both playing on  the plane why didn't  you link up wirelessly  and chase each other  through the city and  kill each other?  That's like I don't  know.  That's true.  That's kind of gay.  What head to head?  Yeah it's head.  Nice.  You can't do that  on a plane.  Hook up wire.  Oh my God would  you listen to this  man.  The beverage card  has to come through 
[03:50:30]  here.  You can't have wires  stretching.  How are you going to  do it on a plane  without getting on  the internet?  You can't go through  one computer or the  other.  Here's the magic.  The devices talk to  each other.  Forget about it.  I don't know what  I'm talking about.  I'm sorry.  Wow Rich.  I don't know.  Rich you really have  to just look into  technology a little  popular culture.  Kind of get just  enough knowledge where  you don't sound  completely stupid when  we bring these things  up.  I don't even know.  Can you put movies on  the iPods? 
[03:51:00]  Listen first of all  because you can't do  an hour and a half on  stage.  I can't but listen to  me.  I don't know any of  this.  It's right.  Okay.  All right.  But listen to his  radio show.  What are you talking  I had a good show  last year.  I heard the first  five minutes were  great.  No we did three  hours.  I heard the first  five minutes was  great.  Listen to the  message boards.  I got good.  It's time for the  line of the day.  Let's just put it  at that.  The message boards.

[03:52:30]  Right.  The Laszlo show is quite  different than the  Technophile.  We don't really talk  about technology.  So you're doing the  Laszlo show not the  Technophile show.  Right.  Fuck me then Laszlo  okay.  I got confused there.  You know you see on  the message boards  like I don't talk  about technology.  Then check out the  Laszlo show.  I don't know.  I thought it was  geek shit.  Nah.  We leave that to  Big Kev.  There is an audience  out there for it.  And it's geek stuff  not geek shit.  Geek stuff.  Big Kev's geek shit.

[04:10:30]  get hit by a big ball  oh geez  Danny and Eric are throwing things  furiously at each other  this was set up  it's not a surprise  there's no reason to get so marble mouthed  about it  yeah  this is an interesting bit  because  Eric  is instrumental in setting it up  remember when he used to do stuff  that was a long time ago  stop touching me  long time  he's just sitting  making faces  alright  back in the 0-4  hit it  John Malby's going downstairs  to the Steinway facility  this place is absolutely beautiful  he is going to horrify people down there 
[04:11:00]  if they let him sit down  and start playing  they're going to be all happy  because he's very good  and it's going to look all cool  because he's going to play a nice tune I bet  and then when he breaks into his smut  Jesus that would be great  that's going to be awesome  boy he sure needs his piano  when he starts singing that stuff  without any music at all  that's bad  brutal  Danny  Eric again  why do they keep saying Danny on the line  don't know  hey could someone else call  I want to get like some stereo action down there 
[04:11:30]  okay let me get one of the interns off the street  oh there might be  never mind Eric  yeah  alright so what's going on down there  first of all set this up for us  okay we're in the middle of the Steinway showcase  they gave him the big grand piano  right here in the middle  do they know who he is  no idea  but they were just tuning the piano  and then removed everything  so John sat down  and he's tickling the ivory  that's John playing right now  let's listen to what he's playing  yeah  plays very well

[04:16:30]  that's amazing  cause I'm just  you're just right there  you got it  queued up and everything  just a big fat poo  uh  yeah  right there  he is a fat poo  here it is  Stern rebuffed the comments  today stating  I've got more enemies  now than I ever have  we are so successful  here at Satellite Radio  the entire radio industry  effing with me  hiring publicists  to plant whatever  S they can say  in the paper  to make it seem  like we're losers  my enemies are  way worse than  the government  big business  is my enemy  business people  desperate for money  and let me tell you 
[04:17:00]  they are way worse  than the government  you're a friggin  mad man  you're crazy  it's a conspiracy  I went to the studio  today  Robin was preparing  the news  I told Artie  to stir the sauce  keep stirring the sauce  I had to go out  and get some show prep  so I got in my car  my limo actually  the limo driver  was taking me around  and I looked up  and a black helicopter  was following me  obviously hired  by terrestrial radio  but I had things to do 
[04:17:30]  I had to get out  to the Hamptons  and make sure  they got the money  for the new  Howie Mansion  out in the Hamptons  so I drove out there  and the builder  wasn't ready  with my Howie Mansion  yet  so I hopped back  in the Howie  limo  and drove back  and there were  more helicopters  following me  I called Artie  to make sure  he was still  stirring the sauce  and I called  Robin  to make sure  the show  Robin what  they're after me  because that's 
[04:18:00]  how it happens  if it was a  terrestrial person  I would have been  dead  I never would have  seen him coming  you paranoid ass  this is called  being funny  so that's it  huh  that's it  half a billion dollars  for a life  it's a good system  they took a lot  of my listeners 
[04:18:30]  and cut it  into little slivers  and I got one  so I went back  to the studio  and started  trying to do  the show  but Artie  was still  stirring the sauce  and Robin  hadn't gotten  done with  the show prep  and she needed  her good luck hat  you paranoid  schizo  jackass  it's our time  to shine  mother effer 
[04:19:00]  no one  is giving  a  you're done  a flying one  start realizing it  he is so scary  such a scary  scary person  to terrestrial radio  do you realize  how irrelevant  you've become  could you step out  from the ivory tower  and your yes people  and look around  at reality  for a second  could you leave  a polo match 
[04:19:30]  so I went  to the polo match  and I put a bet  down on  I don't even know  if you can bet  on polo  but I bet anyway  we had a bunch  of old tapes  that I wanted to play  but Robin panicked  and flushed them  down the toilet  we needed those  tapes Robin  what are we  gonna do now  oh they were  gonna find them
