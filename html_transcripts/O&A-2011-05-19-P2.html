<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about one of the hosts’ late puberty and subsequent high school body image issues.  This transitioned into a discussion about Eastside Dave’s lavish wedding, funded by Wiki, and Dave’s subsequent insubordinate behavior towards program director Rob Cross, including alleged threats to end Cross's career.  The hosts contrasted this with Cross's generally accommodating nature and briefly mentioned plans for lunch with Kid Kelly.  The segment concluded with speculation about Fez’s opening for the upcoming Ron and Fez show, predicting a likely focus on gay themes or *Two and a Half Men*, and hypothetical discussions about replacing Fez (possibly with Ashton Kutcher) in case of a prolonged absence.  The show then closed with the usual announcements and sign-off.

Following this, the "After O&A Live" segment with Sam Roberts commenced.  Sam, along with Roland, E-Rock, D-Boy, and Travis, discussed a SiriusXM NASCAR contest where listeners wrote essays to win a trip and $1000, with three winners competing in a physical fitness challenge against show representatives.  Roland and E-Rock initially refused due to management referring to them as "fatso's," leading to a heated discussion and involvement from Rob Cross in attempting to resolve the issue. The plan eventually shifted to Sam competing against E-Rock. Bobo called in, upset about his exclusion from the contest, proposing a bet where winning would secure him better airtime, and losing would result in his permanent removal.  Listeners were polled on Bobo's participation.

The show then previewed upcoming guests: Chris Hardwick, John Rich, Bill Burr, and Dr. Steve. A clip from Joe Rogan’s podcast with Jim Norton was played, sparking a conversation about polar bears, animal attacks, and hypocrisy.  A discussion followed about offensive language, specifically "faggot" and "nigger," with Sam and Ron Bennington (who joined later) sharing their opinions and referencing the Michael Richards incident and hypocrisy surrounding morality.  Fez’s potential return to rehab, the possibility of him staying with Opie, and a recap of American Idol were also discussed. The show concluded with personal anecdotes from Sam about his relationship with his girlfriend, Jess, and his high school dating life, interspersed with numerous digressions, humorous moments, and listener call-ins, including a recurring joke about a song D-Boy created about Bobo’s "tiny little dick."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  What a show, what a show, what a show.  And now it's time for After Opie and Anthony Live with me, Sam Roberts.  We're all still hanging out.  The talent has left, so the rest of us are still here.  Roland, you're hanging out. You rock?  Yes.  Travis and Danny are around somewhere.  Troy, I think D-Boy's here. 
[00:00:30]  He tends to lock himself up in his production booth.  But he pumps out works of genius while he's in there,  so he's got to be doing something right.  I was just walking back from the bathroom,  and in one of the studios, I think the guy from Glee is here.  Yes, he is.  The guy who came back, what's his role on the show?  He left and came back to perform with the group to help him win the finals.  The finals, right, to help him go to nationals.  No, next week is the season's finale. 
[00:01:00]  I know, I watched it on Tuesday.  Ooh, sorry.  You know, Roland, me and you are Gleeks.  Yes, we are right there.  Eric, are you watching Glee?  Nope.  Why not?  I had no interest in it.  What did you think of today's show, buddy?  Today's show was...  Are you nervous?  No, we're two for two for two-hour segments.  Are you nervous about next Friday?  What, against you?  Yeah.  No.  You should be.  Why?  You're not afraid of losing?  I'm going to put Bobo on hold.  I see him calling.  I don't think it's afraid of losing.  It's more that I'm not concerned to win. 
[00:01:30]  What type of an attitude is that to have?  The same attitude going into this that I really didn't want to do this in the first place.  You're sitting there, and you've got Anthony's betting on me, Opie is betting on you, Jim  is betting on you, and they're hearing you saying, oh, I don't really want to win.  I don't really care one way or the other.  But if I beat Eric, is that a wash?  Are you playing?  I thought...  Here's the thing.  Bobo's calling right now.  We're going to talk to him in a couple minutes.  I don't feel like starting with Bobo.  No, he's not involved in this anymore. 
[00:02:00]  Who, Bobo?  Yeah.  He's been bummed.  Roland, you're going to compete?  You haven't decided yet.  No, I'd say if they want me to, I'm available.  I see.  I see.  Bobo, stay on hold.  I know you can hear.  We're just not going to start with you because it's too much Bobo otherwise.  Yeah, it was a huge...  If you missed the first segment of today's show, you've got to listen to the replay today.  It was a two-hour-long first segment.  And, I mean, Roland...  Hang on, all right?  The whole thing started... 
[00:02:30]  Eric's putting Bobo on hold.  What happened?  He was texting me, and then I went to pick up...  Because you put him on hold.  I was just saying, hang on.  Yeah.  And I pick up the phone, and the line's dead.  Get him back on the phone.  Do you have his number?  Yeah, I think I do.  Hang on.  All right, thanks.  Roland, you came in.  You started the whole thing.  Because we were talking about this promotion we have.  It's...  Somebody is going to win...  A lovely trip.  Two Skybox tickets to the 2011 Pocono 500 race events, which are June 10th through the 12th. 
[00:03:00]  So it's the whole weekend, and you're going to win Skybox tickets, and Roland, they're  even going to give them $1,000 in cash to do whatever they want with.  They're going to have a great weekend.  And the way you win this thing is, you have to say in 500 words or less.  So technically, it could be one word.  It just has to be less than 501.  500 words or less.  Send an email explaining why you're NASCAR's biggest fan, why you want the tickets, and 
[00:03:30]  you can email that to us.  The email and everything is up on SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  And the contest is, we're going to pick three of you, three of the people who send in these  emails are going to be picked.  Those three people are going to be attached to show representatives who will be competing  in a physical fitness challenge on the air next Friday.  But to enter, you have to enter by this Friday, so enter now if you're going to enter. 
[00:04:00]  It's $1,000, why not?  But, Roland, the original plan was for you and E-Rock to both be competing.  Yes.  Yesterday, and E-Rock was telling me this, yesterday you caught wind that there were comments being  made about you and E-Rock as the two fat guys on the show.  And the, actually it's called Fatso's.  Fatso's.  He said that Dr. Steve, Eric told me this, that Dr. Steve, the resident doctor here, called  you guys in your office, you and E-Rock, explaining that he was sending a body fat machine. 
[00:04:30]  Body fat, and they told him to bring a scale also.  And then he told you that he talked to management, and what did management say to Dr. Steve?  Um, yeah, we got two fatso's that we could, uh, and he goes, who?  And he went, Eric and Roland.  You described you guys as fatso's?  Yes.  That rubbed you the wrong way, because immediately today, when they asked you to come on the air,  you were throwing bullets, not even barbs, bullets. 
[00:05:00]  You were, Venomous Roland was live and direct.  Yes, if they wanted, at least come on here and say, hey, you two fatso's are going to  do it, fine, I'll respect that.  Yeah.  If they're going to be behind my back, and then tell other people.  That's not how you play.  No.  Um, you gotta go, give Rob Cross some credit.  Rob Cross, in management, came down and he was on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Yeah.  He came on the air.  I think he's officially been on every live show now.  Has he been on Running Fest?  Yeah.  He hasn't done, was he on special delivery at the Kong off? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, we talked to him.  Okay, so he has been on every live show.  Or maybe someone told him that he had to go on air so the other person didn't have to  come on air.  Ooh.  There's still a little venom left in you, Roland.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  But what happened was Roland ended up controlling the room, tearing everybody limb from limb.  And eventually, we were trying to figure out, what are we going to do?  Roland doesn't want to compete under these circumstances in the physical fitness challenge. 
[00:06:00]  E-Rock flat out refused to compete.  And by the way, I don't know, E-Rock, who you had in that room with you, but apparently  you've got a cheering section now?  Yeah.  One guy can't do another voice, but they were fantastic.  They just showed up out of nowhere.  It was like a flash mob.  And just started cheering for you every time you spoke.  It was like the E-Rock posse.  Yeah.  Team E-Rock is alive and well.  And I heard the rumor is it may grow.  Really?  Yes.  It may get louder.  Well, what happened was E-Rock didn't want to compete.  So it was brought up that maybe what needed to happen was for me and Opie and Anthony suggested 
[00:06:30]  that I enter this competition and compete with E-Rock to see who, you know, so E-Rock could  put me in my place.  I think the whole staff should have competed, but because of the rules that only three were  allowed to participate in this event.  No, but I mean, also people want to see this battle come down to me versus you.  I mean.  Really?  Yeah.  The thing about it is I'm going to, one week from tomorrow, humiliate you in front of two 
[00:07:00]  countries.  Have you read Twitter?  People really don't like hearing you on the air.  I know they don't like it, but this is the problem.  Everybody's going to have your back and say, E-Rock, it's time for you to put Sam in his  place and you're not going to be able to do it.  I mean, I don't know what they're going to say after I say, look, I won.  What do you want from me?  What more do you need from me?  I mean, Sam's afraid if I compete, I'll beat him.  Well, I mean, you might be able to beat me.  I don't know, but that's not what was.  Because I'll go to the mind frame.  I will kill you.  Shh.  You're stepping on his promo.  He's got to cut this up and send it to WWE. 
[00:07:30]  Let him finish.  I'm not sending anything anywhere.  All I'm saying is that on Friday, next Friday.  Send me, sweetheart.  And Roland, you're probably aware of this.  I'm going to defeat E-Rock soundly.  The thing right there, boom, confidence.  Exactly.  E-Rock doesn't have any of it.  You say, boom, I'm going to kill him.  I'm going to win.  Right.  You have confidence.  You say, whoever I'm competing with, I'll kill him.  I will shit in their mouth as I pass by them.  Right.  That's the way a winner speaks.  I'm going to take seconds off my time to shit in people's mouth.  Look at you.  Not everybody is willing to do that. 
[00:08:00]  E-Rock, on the other hand.  I have confidence.  I'm very confident I'm not winning this thing.  What the fuck is that?  What is that attitude?  I mean, how do you go through life with that?  I piss excellence.  Exactly.  I know how it feels.  You know what I mean?  Me and you, we say grace to baby Jesus.  We know.  We do.  We know.  It's shake and bake time.  Shake and bake.  E-Rock, on the other hand, all he knows about you.  He's a French racer.  Hello, I'm here.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  No real confidence.  Nothing to back up.  But should we talk to Bobo now?  He's angry.  All right.  Bobo, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm angry that you stole my spot.  Bobo, I didn't steal anyone's spot.  You were talked about to compete in this.  And then, all of a sudden, Opie and Anthony said that, listen.  Let's raise the stakes.  Yeah, Bobo doesn't have any drawing power, as far as this competition goes. 
[00:09:00]  It's not an exciting thing.  The audience hates him.  Yeah, it's not an exciting thing to tell the audience Bobo's going to be competing.  But, if we could set up a grudge match between E-Rock and Sam, that's something that we can market.  Now...  Yeah, well, this upsets me, because I've been waiting for an appearance at Opie and Anthony's show for so long.  Getting an appearance.  Ed, you stole it.  Well, I didn't...  Bobo, I was asked to take it, and I took it.  See, that's the thing.  Sam, the spotlight's on him, and do you know what happens?  He rises to the occasion.  Exactly.  I shine. 
[00:09:30]  What can you do that makes it worthwhile for you to be in this competition, Bobo?  Well, I was going to win it.  No, you were.  I don't think you were, Bobo, and you're not going to beat me.  I was going to win it, and I was going to make whoever fan that was going to win those tickets because of me win it.  I was going to win over the fans.  Yeah, we get it.  Yeah, I understand, but now I'm in the competition, and there's no way you're going to beat me. 
[00:10:00]  Well, I prefer that.  I'm going to...  I will beat you next week.  You're not...  I mean...  How are you going to beat him when you don't even...  You're not going to compete.  Well, I want to be entered in this.  Bobo, you called up the office.  Why?  While the show was on, you tried to get in touch with me by calling my office phone, and I told you to save it for the air.  He called Travis's phone.  He called a lot of people. 
[00:10:30]  Bobo, what's your proposal here?  What are you proposing?  Did I enter it, all right?  No.  And if I win, I take over worse spots in a 10 o'clock hour for a week.  What if you lose?  You never come back again.  No.  No, it does not come back again, all right?  I disappeared for a month, for two months.  No, one year.  Here's the thing, Bobo.  You were banned for six and still showed up.  Yeah, if you...  The thing about that bet that doesn't make any sense is that since we work on the show, 
[00:11:00]  if we wanted you to disappear for a month, we wouldn't have to make a bet.  We would just not book you.  Should we let him?  You know what I'm saying, Bobo?  Yeah.  Are you coming in here tomorrow still?  Yeah.  Why?  Travis booked for 10 o'clock.  He booked him?  10 o'clock.  10 o'clock.  You're coming on my show tomorrow, Bobo?  I don't know. 
[00:11:30]  I'm not coming tomorrow.  I didn't know what day it was.  If this thing was going to happen tomorrow.  It's four weeks from tomorrow.  Well, Bobo, the thing about tomorrow was supposed to be like a hype day for it.  But if...  I mean...  All the hype was today, though.  Yeah, today was the hype, and it doesn't even seem like you're in it.  I guess I don't really know who the third contestant is yet.  It's a mystery.  Bobo, do you think you should be the third contestant?  Yes, I should be. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  Well, somebody on line one is really captivated by this.  Line one, you think Bobo should be the third contestant?  Oh.  Line four?  Line 12.  Bobo, I'm not getting a lot of Bobo support right now.  Well, where's everybody hanging up, all right?  They're not.  No.  Says they're on my site, disappears, and never shows up when they're supposed to. 
[00:12:30]  They also block you on Twitter, Bobo.  Do you have...  You heard the EROC army today, right?  Or the flash mob.  Did you...  Do you have a Bobo army or anything like that?  And your mom does a can.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  All right.  Where are they?  They never appear on the air, all right?  Very mysterious, Bobo.  All right. 
[00:13:00]  So, I know Dr. Steve is going to be here tomorrow.  Do we have any...  Do we have a big celebrity guest we can announce for tomorrow?  Chris...  He's coming from...  Chris Hardwick.  Chris Hardwick's going to be here tomorrow.  And John Rich.  John Rich is coming in tomorrow from The Apprentice, from Big and Rich.  John Rich is coming in tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  That's big.  So, I mean...  And Bill Burr.  And Bill...  So, Bill Burr.  Chris Hardwick.  John Rich.  Dr. Steve.  Bobo, where do you fit into this? 
[00:13:30]  I don't know.  I don't know where to hear any of these guys.  James, in North Carolina, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  We usually don't take calls.  No.  Sam, you know, I think that Bobo needs to be involved in this thing.  You do?  I mean, all the times that you've made fun of him over the last six months...  Yeah.  I mean, you really hurt his feelings.  You got him, you know, could have got him arrested on the bus with the banging of the pans. 
[00:14:00]  I mean, his mother could come down there and kick your ass.  Bobo, you...  I mean, I think that you should let him on there.  You think that...  And then the other question America wants to know, is Ted's going to go into the nut hut?  Well, I'll ask Ron when he gets here about that, James.  But, uh...  So, James thinks...  What about another James?  James the Trucker.  What do you think?  Hey, man.  I'll say let Bobo do it.  You want to see Bobo in this thing?  I'll do a little exercise, yeah.  Okay.  What about Momo? 
[00:14:30]  Yes, John.  My name is Momo, and I'm a big Bobo supporter.  Okay.  I thank Bobo for the unit because he had three-carb strikes.  So, thank you, Momo.  Bobo, I guess you do have an army.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like I do got an army, and let me tell you something.  It ain't...  It ain't...  It ain't reach on strength.  You know what it is?  What is it?  It's the strength of will to win.  Wow!  That's some...  That's powerful stuff, Bobo. 
[00:15:00]  The strength and will to win.  He's more confident than Eric right now.  Yeah, it is the strength of will to win.  I ain't gonna go down without a fight.  You mean back in there?  Joe.  Yeah.  What do you think?  You're on after Opie and Anthony.  I think you need to let Bobo in there just to kick your ass, but I'm all Team E-Rock.  So, you think if it were...  If it's Bobo, E-Rock, and me, I'm in third place?  Oh, yeah.  No question.  All right.  I mean, that's a strong opinion. 
[00:15:30]  Thank you, Joe.  Jordan.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam, I think Bobo should be allowed in.  Only if Anthony gets to fuck his sister.  That's disgusting, Jordan.  That's not...  That's not...  That's not cool.  Is his sister, huh?  She's underage, Roland.  Oh.  Uh, Bobo, I just got a text from Danny in the office.  Yeah?  Tell me about your prostitute fund.  No.  Why not?  Danny just...  I...  I started to start a prostitute fund.  You did.  How much do you have now saved? 
[00:16:00]  I didn't start...  I just threw in...  I just threw in 50 in that.  That's not bad.  Well, would you put your prostitute fund on the line in the competition?  All right.  You think about that.  You think about that in your own time.  Bobo, listen.  We really...  It only really started, so...  Yeah.  There isn't really anything to put online in that competition.  We'll go to the final call that I'm going to take on this. 
[00:16:30]  We got to...  I mean, everybody's talking about this.  And by the way, to Opie, evidence here that if I want the calls lit up, they will light the fuck up.  Uh, Conch, Critter?  Yeah, hey, Sam.  Can you guys just kill this bit, man?  This guy's a fucking idiot.  Okay.  Did you get rid of him for one time?  I love this guy.  So you're thinking just kill him?  He's just fucking...  Hey, Roland.  How's it going, man?  Yeah, how are you?  All right, so, Bobo, they're definitely on both sides of the fence for you, but you are... 
[00:17:00]  Travis did say that you could come in tomorrow.  All right, I'm doing this, and I'm going to compete in this to prove everybody wrong that I am going to win, and I ain't going down on a fight.  All right, Bobo.  Well, you make a case for yourself tomorrow, and hopefully we'll see you in the competition.  Just put up him in his courier list.  He can't come up.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Okay.  He's upset that the phone call's over. 
[00:17:30]  E-Rock, I wanted to play the last push-up competition, but we have to take a break, right?  Yeah, we got to take a break.  We have to take one more phone call before the break.  Why take another phone call?  I don't know.  Just because I already hung up on Bobo.  Still.  People have strong opinions.  All right, I mean, I like Marcos.  I always like Marcos.  Marcos, you're on the show.  You're the last phone call, because Roland wants one more phone call before break.  That's great.  I was going to say, we should make Pride Time Sam Roberts versus Evok, the Ultimate Warrior 
[00:18:00]  Nagel, and Bobo, the Hobo versus Roland, the Enforcer.  Roland, the Enforcer.  Would you take on Bobo, the Hobo?  Oh, I would.  All right.  Thanks, Marco.  All right.  So, who knows which direction he's going to go in?  A lot of people want Bobo, but then there are still some that would prefer he was just  dead.  Robert Cross, okay, I had a fourth, though.  He did.  He did okay then?  He said it during the years.  Yeah, no problem.  All right.  Well, if we had a fourth and no listener takes my side, I'm going to win the competition  and none of you are getting a prize.  And that's the truth. 
[00:18:30]  Now, E-Rock, I wanted to play the last push-up contest we did.  We got a break, though.  You were involved in that.  And we also are playing a Joe Rogan clip with Norton on the show, right?  Correct.  All right.  Well, hopefully we'll have time for both of those.  Good thing I got Bobo off the phone.  When After Opie and Anthony Live continues.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick. 
[00:19:00]  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick, my dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick.  All right.  I'll just go for the part.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick. 
[00:19:30]  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick.  All right.  That's the song.  That's really good, Bobo.  Bobo Dick Breaks on After Opie and Anthony Live.  That is just some of the genius that Derek pumps out of there when he's hidden away in his studio. 
[00:20:00]  I wonder if...  Because Bobo is coming in tomorrow, but I'm worried that I'm just going to end up with him on this hour  because they're not going to want to talk to him.  I mean, what do they have to talk to him about?  What's he going to talk about?  His prostitution fund?  He's a very strange person.  I think I just saw somebody I graduated from college with on ESPN, and at first I was jealous,  but then I realized I'm doing a radio show, you know?  Should I still be jealous, E-Rock?  Yeah, he's on ESPN.  Oh, man.  I was almost where I should have been, and now I'm back down. 
[00:20:30]  I think he's ahead of you for the reunion right now.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  Well, E-Rock, there's a new show coming to the weekends.  The Joe Rogan Experience Podcast is being added to the weekend lineup.  Uh, it's going to be on, starting next weekend, not this coming weekend, but Memorial Day weekend.  Uh, it's regular time slot, which will be Saturdays at noon, Eastern, of course, because anybody who's civilized in this country follows the Eastern time zone.  Let's be honest.  First, um, we're going to save E-Rock, let's save the last push-up contest from several years ago until tomorrow. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  Because we should get, if, but Dr. Steve's, well, you know what?  The physical fitness challenge where I destroy E-Rock and humiliate him in front of two countries, that doesn't take place for another week.  So sometime tomorrow or next week, we'll play the push-up contest where, E-Rock, you won that one, right?  Uh, no, I did not.  Oh.  I guess you're making a habit of this then.  That was Travis.  Um, well, because now we're talking about the Joe Rogan Experience, and again, that'll be noon Eastern as we civilized people practice the Eastern time zone. 
[00:21:30]  Uh, so I guess that's what, 9 a.m. in the West?  Who knows?  You West Coast people, I don't know how you tell time.  Everything's in the East Coast.  Math is hard.  It really is.  Uh, but this Sunday, we're doing a marathon from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern time.  We're doing a Joe Rogan marathon on the virus right here. 
[00:22:00]  So tune in.  If you're unfamiliar with Joe Rogan's show, The Joe Rogan Experience, it's been on his website forever, so you should have heard it by now.  All you have to do is go to his website to hear it.  But if you're one of those people who says, you know what?  I don't listen to shows on my computer.  I need it to come from my radio.  This is the type of thing you're going to hear.  He, our friends are his friends, and his friends are our friends.  We, uh, played a little clip.  Bill Burr was in studio today.  Uh, we played yesterday on After Opie and Anthony Live.  We played Bill Burr on The Joe Rogan Experience. 
[00:22:30]  Today, we have a clip of, uh, and Norton talked about doing this.  He said he had a great time.  We have a clip of Joe Rogan's, uh, podcast with Jim Norton.  Yeah, they did this live in Los Angeles from, uh, Kevin Smith's Smodcastle.  Kevin Smith.  He's just, the thing I don't understand about Kevin Smith is he has these tiny little business ventures.  Like, he rents out this Smodcastle for, like, however much.  He probably makes a couple hundred bucks.  Like, what does he need a couple hundred bucks for? 
[00:23:00]  He's a movie director.  He, he just likes to create.  He's got all these little side businesses that don't make any money.  He just loves, Kevin Smith loves talking about Kevin Smith.  He just, Kevin Smith loves Kevin.  I mean, we all love Kevin Smith.  But none of us as much as Kevin Smith.  Uh, Joe Rogan, this is him, and Jim Norton.  Jim couldn't get enough.  He said he's gonna go back and do the podcast again.  When he does go back to do it, you'll hear it on the virus.  But since he didn't hear it the first time, you can hear it now on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:23:30]  One quick thing, too.  That was such a good seg into the bit, though.  I was waving to you, just to let you know.  This is just a little portion of it.  But you can hear the whole thing this Sunday with Jim Norton and Joe Rogan.  I thought you were gonna plug the marathon, the website.  And I was gonna say, why don't you just put it on the marathon?  But since you plugged the marathon, you did the right thing.  Unfortunately, you're still gonna lose a week from Friday.  Who cares?  In the physical fitness gym.  You better care.  You're going to be humiliated.  No one cares.  I don't.  Troy cares. 
[00:24:00]  Where did you come from?  He's got 50 bucks on this thing, and it's under me.  Go Sam!  Go Sam!  Then you won 50 bucks, Troy.  There you go.  That's right.  Sorry, Ope.  You have a defeatist attitude, and it's disgusting to everybody listening.  This is the Joe Rogan experience on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Have you ever had hemp shirts or clothing?  Yeah, they're canvas-y.  Well, they can make them soft, right?  You should make them out of the skin of a fucking stroke-having polar bear.  As you drink your water from a box.  What was that bear's name? 
[00:24:30]  What was his name?  Oh, Kut?  The bear that just fucking dropped out of a stroke?  Where is he?  Germany.  Germany, yeah.  Sorry, too soon?  That must be so frustrating, to be a polar bear and be in a fucking zoo.  I know.  I think I'm having a stroke, because no one knows what you're saying.  He's probably happy it's over.  Happy his internment's over.  I mean, that's what they live for, is killing things.  They can't even kill anything.  You just feed them the food?  This is ridiculous.  You know how much they must love when a fucking...  When some delusional asshole jumps in the fucking... 
[00:25:00]  He gets a picture.  Or some fat person off.  Have you seen the video online of the girl who gets her leg bitten?  No.  She gets her leg broken.  He locks ahold of her leg through the bar.  Somehow or another, she got so close that he could grab ahold of her,  pull her into him, and bite down on her leg.  He snapped her femur.  And he bit into her leg.  Oh, no.  And they're screaming, and they're beating him with sticks.  Yeah, they're beating him with sticks, and he's like,  Fuck you.  I got her.  I'm not letting her go.  Yeah.  And somehow or another, they got him to let go, but she was fucked up.  Is that the one... 
[00:25:30]  There was one video I saw with a guy...  Not so, there's an Asian guy.  He got...  His jacket got grabbed.  Did you see that one?  Where he was close to the bear cage, and it grabbed his coat?  And they had to take him out of his coat,  so the bear couldn't pull him through the cage by his...  Say coat again.  I just keep saying coat.  Coat, coat, coat.  Have you seen the video where the bear that they...  It was a movie bear, and they used him in a bunch of different movies.  And there was a guy standing there, and they were doing drills with this bear,  and the bear just decided to attack the guy and rips his fucking throat out.  And it was the trainer's cousin, I believe it was. 
[00:26:00]  And he just...  Anybody know what I'm talking about?  What's that?  The semi-pro bear.  Semi-pro.  Yeah, he was in the movie Semi-Pro.  And this bear fucked up this...  For no reason.  There's a video of it.  And so what does this asshole do?  Well, they have to retrain the bear.  What?  You don't shoot that fucking thing?  Are you crazy?  A bear ate your cousin.  And you're gonna go...  He doesn't even lose his job?  He still gets to be your trained bear?  It's fucking completely ridiculous.  How would you forget to train him not to eat people? 
[00:26:30]  Shouldn't that be the first thing?  Clawing throat's bad.  It's the most ridiculous attitude ever people have about these animals.  About keeping them alive.  Like, we need them.  You know, it's important.  They're a part of our ecosystem.  Like, if we don't have polar bears, I think we're gonna be okay.  You know, we might have a few extra fucking seals laying around.  We'll go shoot those fucking things in the head and that'll be the end of it.  We'll have to fuck on uglier rugs if there are no polar bears.  So what?  Polar bear rugs are beautiful. 
[00:27:00]  That's kind of a fucked up thing.  Bear rugs are the only rug where they keep that fucking head on it.  Yeah.  They want you to see that stupid thing they conquered.  Yeah.  You know, big giant head that can eat your asshole.  Attached to a carpet.  And it looks like he's flying.  He's probably so embarrassed because his legs are all out.  I had a jacket once and it had fur on the inside of the jacket.  It was like a hoodie with fur on it.  And this woman actually pointed at my jacket and she's like, I do not like your jacket. 
[00:27:30]  I do not like you wearing fur.  So I go, it's fucking fake fur.  Like, you know, like what's the big deal?  She was like, I don't like what it represents.  See what happens?  Like killing fake animals?  Wookies?  The fuck is wrong with you?  You got her though.  She wanted to be self-righteous.  And when you said it's fake, that should have ended it for her.  But she had to win.  So she went, oh, I don't like what it represents.  You should have just fucking, I saw the spin kicks you were fucking teaching St. Pierre.  You should have thrown one. 
[00:28:00]  Right in the fucking, you should have just kicked her fucking internal plumbing out.  You should have given her a hysterectomy with your heel.  What is it about people that love to be fucking self-righteous?  What is it about people that love to be the one who takes the moral high ground and would  never do that and no one ever, you know, what the fuck is that?  That's why we love seeing them get busted.  That's why we love politicians that like fucking legislate against gays, but then they get  caught blowing somebody.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Everyone loves a good hypocrite to be fucking brought down.  It's just satisfying.  Yeah, because it's such an easy stance to take.  Did you hear about the guy in Vegas who's a prosecutor?  We were talking about it on the podcast earlier today.  He prosecuted Bruno Mars and Britney, no, Harris Hilton.  Yeah.  And he got buying crack.  Like not, not even ecstasy, you know, he's, he's buying crack.  Like a self-hating junkie, you know?  It's like, no, no one's out there going, dude, there's a lot of people talking shit about 
[00:29:00]  crack, but let me tell you something.  It really straightened my life out.  Dude, I started cleaning the house.  I stopped eating.  I was doing a lot of chores.  That's my friend, Eddie, dated a lot of girls that used to do meth.  He was dating a lot of strippers at one point in his life.  And he would say, you always know when you're dating a girl who does meth because their houses  are spotless because they don't eat.  And he goes, and you can fuck them in the butt and there's never anything in there because  they don't eat.  They never shit.  So you never have to worry.  It's always clean.  He's like, it's amazing. 
[00:29:30]  You just fuck them in the ass all the time.  That's great.  You know, they don't waste any time with dental hygiene if they're on meth.  That's great.  So if you fuck the ass real hard, a tooth falls out.  You go, ah.  That was a two-toother.  All right.  Sorry.  That's a problem with a lot of people who were talking about the self-righteous thing.  I know that you get fucking crazy about liberals and about people who take the moral high ground.  But I don't hate liberals.  I agree with them on most things. 
[00:30:00]  Like, I'm for gay marriage, gay adoption.  And so much of what they stand for, I agree with.  But it's they've let me down.  You know, like, I get what I get from the conservatives.  You know what I mean?  Like, because I make my living talking.  So language is important to me, like it is everybody.  But the conservatives always were shitty about it.  They would always target you for going after the church.  Or if you said fuck, they would always, you know, you're obscene.  But the liberals were supposed to stand for something different.  There was supposed to be this oasis of free thought.  But then they became restrictive.  You know, don't make fun of this.  Don't make fun of that.  How much do you think they did that just to try to win votes? 
[00:30:30]  To try to get the middle?  Try to go after the center?  You know, that's when things get blurry, right?  Yeah, but I think that like any other, nobody ever says I'm a fucking free speech repressing asshole.  No one ever says I'm self-righteous.  Everyone gives themselves a reason.  Like the conservatives say it's family values and I'm protecting family values.  And the liberals say, well, we're fighting hate speech and we want people to have a safe haven.  Everyone gives themselves a reason to shut you up for what they don't like hearing.  It's annoying.  Yeah, the hate speech. 
[00:31:00]  It's like I recently retired the word faggot and I relish every chance to talk about how I retired the word faggot.  So I get to use it again.  Just because I love the way it comes off the tongue.  It's just, you know, I have a few bits now that I would like to throw faggot in there.  I would like to throw it in there.  I say it a lot once.  I catch myself mumbling and then I realize I'm on the sink in the mirror and I'm like, uh-oh.  But it's a, yeah, see, everybody has a reason. 
[00:31:30]  Nobody ever says I don't like it so you shouldn't say it because that's too revealing.  It's almost too embarrassing for them to admit to themselves that they really are that person.  So they have to paint a reason around it.  And that's why they, oh, that's hateful.  It's this, go fuck yourself.  I used to talk about this on stage, but it's actually true.  When I did my Spike TV special, I used the word faggot twice and once describing my dog and once about ants.  You know, it had nothing to do with gay sex, you know.  Right.  And they beeped out everything except when I was, when they aired it before 11, they beeped out everything. 
[00:32:00]  And then when they aired it after 1 a.m., they went uncensored completely except faggot.  They beeped out faggot.  Like, that's too much.  Like, they drew a line.  And so I had a conversation with this guy, a gay guy at the network.  And he goes, well, it's incredibly offensive and, quite frankly, it's our word.  I go, what?  And he goes, he goes, it's our nigger. 
[00:32:30]  He goes, we can say faggot.  I go, that's the gayest shit I've ever heard in my life.  And you can go fuck yourself.  And I said it an extra three or four years just because of that guy.  He goes, this is the stupidest fucking argument ever.  You know, having one word like nigger is bad enough.  One dangerous, out there, candy man, candy man, candy man word.  I mean, just say it and fucking people punch you in the head.  It's the craziest fucking thing ever.  You know, you could walk down the street and call your basketball a nigger.  You fucking non-bouncing nigger. 
[00:33:00]  And people will just beat the shit out of you.  They will fuck you up.  Like, you have to use basketball, Joe.  I don't want to work like that.  It just came to mind.  It's the first thing that came to mind.  You know, if you were walking down the street calling your banana a cunt, no one's going to, like, fight you.  That's right.  You know?  But you call your dog a nigger.  And they'll fucking call friends to have an excuse to beat the shit out of you.  You know, they'll hold you down and call everyone they know to come over and kick you in the fucking head.  And it's funny, the way that we are inspired to change these words, Michael Richards at the Laugh Factory was what brought the whole conversation back again. 
[00:33:30]  And it was like this dumb society we live in.  We let some fucking blithering idiot who couldn't handle a heckler.  That's all that was.  He just couldn't handle a heckler.  And the only reason we liked Michael Richards is because he would say, oh, hello, Jerry.  That's the guy who you take your social cues from?  I don't give a fuck what he thinks or feels or says.  It's just, whatever we have a chance to be heard, people take it.  The word nigger is a bad word, but we also have social justice for that.  If you say it to the wrong people, you get your fucking teeth knocked out. 
[00:34:00]  And that's the way it should be.  If you say it to a black guy, he punches you in the mouth.  And that should be the penalty.  It's so baffling, though.  When I see trends like that, I always wonder how long they're going to last.  Like, is nigger going to be a bad word 100 years from now?  Or will it be passe?  Will it last forever?  It'll be on NBC by that time.  You think so?  Yeah.  I mean, it looked like 20 years ago.  That's what the end will stand for.  Well, it's good as on Comedy Central.  Nigger black cunt.  I said once on one of my podcasts that, you know, every fucking YouTube video I've ever 
[00:34:30]  had has at least one quote, one comment that says nigger cunt on it.  And some fucking psycho went on every YouTube video that has my name on it and put nigger  cunt in the comments.  Like, the same guy just made it just a life's work.  Like, a fucking, he must have spent hours doing that.  Yeah, it's like that little childish, it's like a weird example.  It's like the Westboro Church.  They're a weird example of people who just like saying bad things. 
[00:35:00]  But they do it with police protection, which I think is kind of funny.  It's like, they think that the war in Iraq is God's way of killing soldiers because they  had an IED thrown into their, they had a bomb thrown into their yard, so they think God  kills soldiers.  But yet they still need police protection.  And they remind me of the people that like to just stand behind the screen door and yell  dirty words.  And that's all it is.  They're just trying to be offensive.  And the social justice for them should be the same as if a guy says nigger to a black  guy.  They should allow the families of these soldiers just to fucking take care of these people  themselves and not protect them.  If you want to use the word, you should, you should suffer the price. 
[00:35:30]  What's really the real problem with people like the God Hates Fags people is that there's  a broad spectrum of human intelligence, just like there's a broad spectrum of dick sizes.  Yeah.  Dicks aren't the same size.  What do you mean?  You know?  Just like some people can't drink, you know?  Some people are dumb as fuck.  And there's nothing you can do about that.  And if you come along and start reading them out of the Bible and the Lord says, a man  shall not lie with a man.  And if he does, shall be burned at the stake and dead with a rock.  And all you have to do is read that shit to them. 
[00:36:00]  And they go, and they're with you, man.  God Hates Fag t-shirts.  They got placards.  They got time.  They don't have a job.  Nobody wants to fucking hire them.  They're walking down the street.  There's plenty of them, man.  We need to fucking figure out how to make the lowest form of human smarter.  After ONA.  Live.  Well, geez.  If I had known that kind of language was going to be involved in this Joe Rogan experience,  I don't know that I would have aired it.  It's an XL channel, Sam.  Sex Bagel.  This should have been cleared by somebody. 
[00:36:30]  Free speech.  I guess so.  What the?  Unbelievable timing.  But what more could you expect from the great Ron Bennington, who has just entered the studio?  Let me ask you a question.  You seen Dave around?  Because I know he owes a little bit of money.  I've heard.  Listen, Ron.  Before we get to anything else, I've been instructed to find out some information from you. 
[00:37:00]  Now, who's giving you these instructions?  These are coming from Opie.  Now, does he talk for you?  Does he have a hand up your ass?  No.  Are you a puppet for him?  He said.  I mean, E-Rock has been through so much lately.  Yeah.  Did you hear about the physical fitness challenge?  Well, let's go over that.  Okay.  I got to.  Well, first.  Because the internet's a buzz.  Everybody's talking about it, right?  Yeah.  Me and E-Rock on a week from Friday will be competing. 
[00:37:30]  There'll be a third person.  It'll probably be someone stupid like Bobo, though.  It won't matter.  Just to fill it out because you've got to do things in three comedically?  Exactly.  In a physical fitness challenge.  You're talking push-ups, sit-ups, possibly running around the block.  This is what bothers me.  You and E-Rock are my two best friends.  How am I supposed to choose?  Well, you have to choose with your heart.  You know?  I mean, you and I have a show.  I have a head.  Yeah, I know.  You and I have a show.  However, E-Rock gave you that signed picture.  Well, it not only gave me the signed picture, but my CompuServe handle, Sex Bagel, he also 
[00:38:00]  uses, I believe, on AOLAIM.  Yeah, and that's a name that he has always touted as his own.  We both have.  I have to ask you this because Opie told me to.  He said, cover this on the Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart's portion of the after show.  All right.  We have time.  Is Fez going back into the nuthouse?  Because somebody, no, multiple people, he said, keep feedbacking in and twittering in 
[00:38:30]  that Fez is going back to the nuthouse.  It's a question I have to ask.  That's how it was phrased.  The nuthouse.  Is Fez Marie Watley going back to the nuthouse?  Um, it's actually on the table.  It's being discussed.  It is.  Yeah, because Fez has a thing of one foot in fun nuts and crazy nuts.  Yeah.  And the other one in sad, depressing nuts.  And his nuts are getting very, very depressing lately. 
[00:39:00]  So we're trying to take a little time, maybe take a little time off so we can get both feet  in the fun nuts house.  It's how I'd like to have it, but it looks like we were looking into a program for anywhere  from two to three years.  You can come back out of that and just be on top of the world.  Two to three years?  Can I give you a tweet here?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  This comes from Adam in MI.  And I don't know whether it's Missouri, Mississippi, Minnesota. 
[00:39:30]  Could be Michigan.  Could be Michigan.  It's so many places.  But Adam says, uh, Sam's one hour show needs credit for all the Ronnie B bits he swipes.  And that went, of course, to E-Rock, uh, a longtime good friend of mine, and Opie.  What are you stealing?  I read it.  You said that when I, when people are on a tour and then they, I say, come in.  Yes, that's fine.  That's a Ronnie B bit.  That's 100% Ronnie B's. 
[00:40:00]  The only thing.  I even have a sounder for it somewhere.  Oh, here.  I don't know whether this is turned on.  Yeah.  And now, a warm welcome to our very special guests, a tour in the hallway.  Yeah, see, I didn't.  Something's happening to my production team that we stopped looking for alliteration or wordplay.  Right.  And we just bluntly go down and hand a paper.  You just get Troy to read something that describes exactly what it is.  Stupid.  I didn't realize that that was a bit. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Whatever's happening, I just try to...  Oh, yeah.  See, you like the lift.  You know, today, I was talking to...  I figured out what the other bit is that he was getting mad at.  Today, I was talking to Bobo on the phone.  Mm-hmm.  And I did...  I've been doing phone bits for years.  I did a thing where I asked Bobo if he had any support, and then I played the dial tones.  Oh, yeah.  Is this a direct rip-off?  Yeah, that's fine.  Okay.  But see, the thing is...  You invented it.  Well, I...  Somebody's got to be funny.  Somebody's got to be out there so the kids can pick up on it. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  But, you know, Opie's concern, and God bless him for being concerned about Fez, is you're  thinking what I'm thinking is that maybe if Fez stayed there this weekend at Opie's place.  That could be great.  Because, I mean, there's a lot of love in that house, a lot of happiness going on.  Maybe that's just the kind of vibe that Fez needs.  And Opie does seem concerned.  Maybe.  Maybe Fez should stay with Opie for the weekend.  Again, I'm going to get in a lot of trouble for being a part of this conversation. 
[00:41:30]  Well, who would be mad at you?  I don't know, but I could just sense tomorrow there's going to be some kind of trouble.  But this may be best for everybody.  And the other idea I had is that your parents, that did such a great job with you...  Thank you.  ...might be nice for Fez to spend a couple days there.  I know my parents would love to have Fez.  Yeah.  And they would definitely take good care of him.  What are you, an upstate kid?  Are you one of those?  Westchester.  I mean, to city people, that's upstate.  Far upstate.  So you're close to Canada.  You can go to Canada for cigars anytime you want. 
[00:42:00]  Much closer to the city.  I was going to tell you, as far as my family goes, my parents were out of town, so they  didn't get to hear Ronnie B and Sammy Sweethearts yesterday.  Yeah.  But I went over to their house.  My brother was watching the dogs.  And he said, oh, it's nice of Ron to bring me up.  So the whole family...  The whole family.  ...is involved.  And he appreciated the mention yesterday.  Well, can we send a JPEG to your mom and dad while they're on the road?  Where are they at right now?  I don't know where they went.  I can't remember.  They swing, right?  Isn't that a big thing?  I know.  Like a Club Med deal with them? 
[00:42:30]  I think it's just a family event.  They're not swingers.  They'll be back tomorrow.  You know what?  There's an elephant in the room here.  Let's get it out of the way.  Fucking Davos would be a lot of money.  Yeah.  How much is it now?  I think it's $62,000.  What?  How did it get this far?  It was $17,000 last I checked.  I don't know.  He, you know, it can...  Vigs.  You can get a Vig going.  Wow.  And I know he doesn't understand the double or nothing rules concretely.  No.  But the other day he said, can I call you in six minutes? 
[00:43:00]  I go, who does such a thing?  You know you go fives and tens in this business.  Yeah.  It's always something.  It really is.  Now, I'm also going to point this out to you.  Fez is going to be very angry that you even brought his name up in a nuthouse type way, too.  I was asked...  So we'll have to smooth that over.  My boss told me, Opie, my boss told me to ask you...  Is he a boss or is he also a friend?  He's a boss and a friend.  Okay.  That's nice.  That's nice to have. 
[00:43:30]  This was when he was in his boss role.  I have that with Steve Blatter.  He's your boss slash friend?  Yeah, we are.  We're friends.  You guys on the weekends and stuff?  Just whatever?  We've been out to dinner together.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  What's that like?  Same as work.  Same exact feeling as work.  It's like friends at work.  I had the...  Yeah, exactly.  No, but I mean, I hope Fez realizes that I only asked you this because I was asked to  get the information.  But do you care about Fez at all? 
[00:44:00]  Deeply.  Okay.  I want the best for Fez.  I took the elevator up with Fez today and he told me that he feels like he has three  topics that he can be definitive about today.  Which are?  One of them was gay related.  I don't remember what it was.  And the other one that he assured me that Chuck Lorre will not kill off Charlie Sheen's character.  He assured you of this?  Leave that door open.  Wow.  So he'll be working on that.  And then something else that's taking place in the gay community. 
[00:44:30]  I can't remember what it is.  So a couple gay things and then the Chuck Lorre.  And there was two gay things and the Chuck Lorre.  Rip from the headlines.  Well, all that and more is coming up.  Oh, I'm also going to tell you this.  One of your...  And I don't know whether you're friends with this person or you fight with this person,  but Lily is stopping in today.  Really?  I don't fight with Lily.  I was friends with her for a while and then we'd lost contact almost completely.  There was a fallout though, right?  I don't know if there was a fallout per se.  Because something had to do with Than and you and whatever happened. 
[00:45:00]  You know what it was?  I have Than in here and she said, how could you do that to me?  You know that's the one that got away.  Well, that...  Yeah, I know that Than was actually pretty...  I thought he was pretty rude.  I thought he was pretty rude about Dave.  Yeah.  I thought he was pretty rude about Lily.  And that wasn't the Than that I remember.  Compatitive too.  Yeah.  He was just ready for a fight with whoever.  Well, you hurt his feelings in a way that I never...  I didn't think he felt that bad.  I always thought Than and Sam was kind of a goofy hobby show.  And I had no idea that, you know, he had that much emotion tied to it. 
[00:45:30]  I'm sorry that he had to go through that.  When is Lily coming in?  I think she's going to be at one because she's coming by.  We're doing an Unmasked with Rob Corddry later.  That's exciting.  And Lily, I didn't even know this, gigantic fan of his.  Why didn't she come in at 10 o'clock and she could have done the Ronnie B.  Sammy Sweetheart show, then Ron and Fez.  You think it's easy to look like Lily?  She needs time.  She's got a full Kardashian gang working on her right now.  Hair, makeup.  Who's getting voted off tonight?  I think Haley made some mistakes last night. 
[00:46:00]  I think Haley made some big mistakes last night.  I'm going to hold you to it.  Because I think the two country kids performed really well for that genre.  And I think they both have careers in front of them.  Haley was my favorite of the three.  But I think, you know, nobody wants to see a teenager singing Stevie Nicks and Led Zeppelin in this day and age.  Well, the Led Zeppelin song that she picked was like the least hooky Led Zeppelin that you could ever find.  There was nothing poppy or American Idol about anything she did.  So it's like, you know, it's nice to...  The other thing was she yelled at the black guy. 
[00:46:30]  And I'm like, he is a judge.  Yeah.  You know?  A little respect.  Yes.  He's been in this business for a little bit of time.  Apparently, he just did a Boys to Men cover.  I heard him drop those names.  Hey, matter of fact, I did that song, Boys to Men.  Boys to Men, last year.  And you're like, last year?  Too bad.  We've done this in 93.  It would have been huge.  It would have been a big money move.  So in your opinion, Haley leaves.  I believe Haley goes home tonight.  Now, I already sent this in to American Idol. 
[00:47:00]  I think it would be great if their chairs turned around.  Yeah.  When the shows started, their chairs flipped.  It's the one thing that that show is missing.  I don't like just looking directly at people.  Yeah.  Turn around.  Scotty McCreary is second place.  And Lauren wins American Idol.  Well, you know, that's what I picked early on this year.  Yeah.  She I picked very early, but I don't see it now.  I think it's Scotty's.  Well, I believe she wins.  And Scotty McCreary is the one to go on and actually sell albums.  He sounds like every other terrible person on country radio. 
[00:47:30]  I mean, he's perfect.  But then so does she, I think.  She sounds like the girls.  Yeah.  She's developed into every terrible girl on country music stations.  But you're right about Haley.  Like, and I didn't even know her name was Haley today.  Because here's the thing with Haley.  A, I always forget her.  And B, I go, hey, she has a nice little body.  You know, but I have to say that every week.  I always remember her because Dave calls her blonde Jess.  That's crazy.  You think she looks exactly like Jess?  She's not.  She's not in fucking Justice League. 
[00:48:00]  I told Jess she was, she was prettier than Haley.  Yeah.  She thought that was very charming.  Well, you act like you're still trying to impress her.  You've lived with her for how long now?  Seven years?  It's like six years almost.  Where did you meet her at?  Well, we went to high school together.  That's where we met.  So you guys were high school sweethearts?  No, we weren't dating in high school.  Did she date anyone that you knew in high school?  Yeah, I knew who she dated in high school.  Does that still kind of bug you a little bit?  No, I don't care at this point.  You ever go like this?  I'm sorry, I'm not Carl.  No.  At this point, our relationship has been substantial and long enough that it's outlasted, outwitted 
[00:48:30]  and outlasted.  But every once in a while, you still check their Facebooks?  I see what Carl's up to every now and then and just see, you know, are they commenting  on each other's walls?  Was she your first?  No.  Because I didn't see you as a young sex guy.  I wouldn't categorize myself as Mr. Young Sex.  But I have a feeling like when you were 15, you looked 12.  Yeah.  I mean, I definitely started late.  But I mean, I was 21 when I started dating Jess.  I didn't start that late. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  But I mean, you seem like, because you have that young thing, that you were one of those  guys who didn't even want to shower with everyone else.  No, I didn't.  Because puberty came late.  It was.  I mean, I was underdeveloped in high school.  Yeah.  You know, and I didn't want to, you know, I was, when swimming came for gym class, it  was definitely, let's change with towels still on.  Right.  I don't want anybody looking.  Because you don't need the nickname Tiny Dick Roberts.  I don't know if that's the nickname.  I mean, there wasn't that much thought put into it.  It was just my bashfulness.  Well, people aren't fucking putting towels around themselves because they're worried their 
[00:49:30]  cock's too big.  I don't want everyone to make fun of my rope dick.  The old giant dick.  It doesn't happen, though.  I guess not.  Mom, what do I do?  Everybody's making fun of me because my penis is huge.  When they see how enormous this is.  So, but after all this time, you're engaged, but that's...  We're engaged.  We're going to get married in like a year.  On the air?  No.  No, we're not going to.  I think it's a crazy thing. 
[00:50:00]  I think to me, only an insane person would get married on the air.  That is true.  It takes a certain...  Although, I'll tell you this.  We don't have Wiki in charge of the channel anymore.  Yeah.  So if I got married on the air, it wouldn't be the gala that Eastside Dave's wedding was,  and I certainly wouldn't get a Vegas honeymoon out of the deal.  E-Rock screamed.  I mean, Elo screamed at Wiki over that.  Wiki spent $30,000 on that wedding.  What's he doing?  What?  And that's the exact amount of money that Dave wanted as a raise, and they wouldn't give 
[00:50:30]  it to him.  I know.  It's really funny.  But Dave also was still mad at Wiki over different things.  How could you be?  Because Dave, when things start going his way, Dave is an asshole.  When it's not, he's just like a lovely guy.  Yeah.  But when it's going his way, he's like, fuck this shit.  Yeah.  He wants it a little better.  So I was even talking with our boss.  Dave yells at him, he says.  Who?  Cross?  Yeah.  I've heard there have been conversations.  But nobody fights with Cross. 
[00:51:00]  We all.  Yeah.  I mean.  With Rob Cross.  Like, he's the most.  He was on Opie and Anthony's show.  He actually went on the air today.  Mm-hmm.  And stayed easygoing.  Oh, whatever.  Rob Cross.  But somehow, I've never actually seen it happen, but I've been told.  Eastside Dave brings out a maniac in Rob Cross.  Well, I guess he calls Rob names.  Yeah.  He tells Rob he'll end his career.  I don't know if he does that.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  Dave tells Rob Cross he'll end his career. 
[00:51:30]  And I've never.  I mean, believe me, I cover the waterfront.  I've never known anyone to fight with Rob.  Rob is, like you said, if a record company calls him, he just goes like, yeah, sure,  we'll get it on.  I mean, he plays everybody's music.  Everything.  Yeah.  And says nice things about everybody.  He looks for the good.  Yeah.  He just gets along.  So what happens with him and Dave?  It's just.  I don't know.  I mean, Dave calls up, I guess, doing what Dave does.  And somehow it clashes with the way Rob usually accepts, you know, conversation. 
[00:52:00]  Well, you can't threaten.  You can't threaten the boss.  Nobody said he threatened him.  You can keep something going.  I guess Dave's not familiar with the old Arizona days because Rob was a god amongst men.  Well, yeah, definitely.  I had a conversation with Kid Kelly.  Kid Kelly knew who Rob Cross was when he was a jock.  Like, because he was that, he was like legendary.  Yeah.  He was one of the guys.  Well, if Kid Kelly knows you, fucking things are happening.  Exactly.  The double K.  I always run into him in the bathroom. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And we bring up the fact that we should go to lunch together sometimes.  Well, you should.  He's a great guy.  Yeah.  But that's always the talk of the bathroom.  It's like, yeah, we ought to get out of here.  And that never happens.  Yeah, no.  Well, you know, everyone's busy.  Well, listen, you're busy.  You have three topics to cover on Ron and Fez today.  At home, this might be a great time to bet what is Fez going to open the show with.  Because we know it's either one.  Two gay topics or Chuck Lorre is not going to kill off Charlie Sheen's character.  And I hope he wasn't offended that I asked the question that Opie wanted to find out about. 
[00:53:00]  Towards me or Opie, we just want to know because we care about Fez.  And the question is what?  Well, I asked you whether or not he's going to, whether he's going to the nuthouse.  But the point is long term, not just like his last week thing, but a long term.  And he, like, a couple years.  What would you do if Fez went to the nuthouse for years?  Just do the show and just call it Ron and Fez?  I would do the show.  I'd still call it Ron and Fez.  I don't see any reason.  I'm not Chuck Lorre.  I don't see any reason to go writing characters off.  But on the other hand of that, I wonder how long it would take before anyone called me. 
[00:53:30]  And said, hey, is Fez in?  I'll just say he's having a bad day.  Would you be looking for an Ashton Kutcher?  My Ashton Kutcher would actually be Ashton Kutcher.  You'd get him?  Yeah.  That'd be a huge show.  We got to somehow come up with $900,000 a week, though.  They love celebrities here at Sirius.  They do.  They'll find the money.  They'll find the money.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  Opie and Anthony after Opie and Anthony Live.  Back tomorrow.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. 
[00:54:00]  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony Live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey.  On the virus.  Thank you.  Yes. </pre>
