<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion about energy policy. Opie and Anthony, along with Jimmy Norton, mocked the idea of "nice" radio, immediately transitioning to a satirical discussion about oil drilling, suggesting ludicrous methods like drilling sideways under the Middle East to access Saudi oil.  They debated alternative fuels, referencing a college student's $10,000 electric car conversion and the alleged impossibility of water-powered cars, sparked by a caller, Evan from New Hampshire, who claimed oil company debt made drilling impossible.  This led to a tangent about the economic consequences of printing more money.  A popcorn kernel lodged in Jimmy Norton's throat provided a humorous, albeit insensitive, interruption.  The discussion then shifted to a website offering hydrogen fuel cell plans and the mysterious death of a man who claimed to have created a water-powered car.

A significant portion of the show focused on musical tastes, comparing The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, with listener calls adding to the debate.  The hosts criticized rock radio's overplaying of hits and underplaying of deeper cuts, mentioning other artists like Janis Joplin, Cinderella, and 38 Special.  The hosts also touted their high ratings, especially amongst male listeners, and announced upcoming guests: Louis C.K., Otto from Otto and George, Pat from Munaki (promised to be featured with a porn star), and Mike Myers.  The show concluded this segment with exaggerated commentary on Rammstein's "Du hast."

The following segment began with a discussion of a new Raconteurs song resembling Led Zeppelin, transitioning to rock photography and artwork, with opinions on Robert Plant, Norman Rockwell, Picasso, and Dali, punctuated by crude jokes.  A listener called in about music downloads and punk covers, followed by the playing of Brad Paisley's "I'm Still a Guy."  The show then detailed the nervous breakdown of an intern, "Cream Pie Jones," after Lisa Sparks' studio visit for his birthday.  Cream Pie Jones called in, blaming illness, nerves, and feeling he'd let the show down; the hosts speculated on the reasons, employing vulgar language and teasing him about his birth control habits.  A phone call with Louie C.K. followed, discussing his Nashville delay, Bonnaroo experience (including a humorous encounter with Lars Ulrich), and dislike of the American "The Office."  The show updated the "Anthelini" saga, gossiping about Jill and Anthony's relationship and a potential employee firing.  The segment concluded with more music and banter with Otto.

A discussion about comedians transitioning to serious roles, mainly focusing on Steve Martin (whose later work the hosts criticized harshly), contrasted with Bill Murray, Clint Eastwood, and Edward Norton, followed.  Listener calls contributed to the critique of Steve Martin's career choices.  Tangents included criticisms of *Stop or My Mom Will Shoot* and *Rhinestone*, and anecdotes about the deceased comedian Frank D'Amico, including his drug use.  A humorous, morbid segment featured Anthony Cumia's fictional "Suicide Hotline," followed by promotion of Otto and George's Atlantic City show.  Studio guest Otto discussed his career, agent issues, and sports, with particular criticism of golf. A news story about a transsexual prostitute's brutal beating by a Memphis police officer was discussed with graphic detail and audio, with the hosts expressing disgust and offering humorous, offensive commentary.  Lisa Sparks contributed to the discussion with sexually explicit anecdotes.  Further promotion of Otto and George's show and conversations with Otto concluded this segment.

A lengthy, sexually explicit segment featured Pat from Munaki and Lisa Sparks in the studio. The conversation started with discussions of strip clubs and sexual acts, focusing on Pat's abstinence and listener attempts to help him have sex.  The hosts encouraged physical interaction, escalating to hugging, Pat sitting on Lisa's lap, and genital touching.  Patty, another guest, joined, leading to more explicit interactions, including touching and kissing Lisa's breasts and genitals.  The hosts continually facilitated the increasingly intimate interactions, with humor derived from the awkwardness.  Pat and Lisa were eventually sent to a private room to continue.  The hosts made numerous sexually suggestive comments and jokes throughout.

Another segment focused on the planned sexual encounter between Pat and Lisa, with humorous banter and suggestions from the hosts. Patty was present but criticized for lacking humor and improvisational skills. Opie discussed his brother Brett's throat surgery.  Crude jokes about the sexual act, Patty's reactions, Pat's performance, and bodily functions continued throughout.  Dave's painful branding experience was described in detail, with humorous commentary.  The segment concluded with Patty crying after the hosts joked about shaving her head again, receiving comfort and money from the hosts.

Finally, a segment featured Pat, referencing past appearances, including an anecdote about her lacking headphones.  The hosts played a game of Mad Libs, starting with a clean version, which Pat struggled with. They then switched to a "dirty" version, prompting Pat for vulgar words.  Pat's reluctance and the hosts' frustrated reactions were comedic.  The resulting Mad Libs story, "The First Day of School," was highly inappropriate, filled with crude and sexually suggestive terms.  The segment concluded with the reading of the story and further ribbing of Patâ€™s performance, briefly mentioning upcoming segments, including "Sex Advice with Jim Norris."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shopjacks, Opie and Anthony.  Shopjacks, Opie and Anthony.  Shopjacks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shopjacks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Pull out the mag and get the round out of the chamber.  Hello?  Yeah.  I'm here.  What was that?  It was one in the chamber.  Larry, I want to apologize on behalf of Jimmy Norton.  Well, no, I mean, he can call me anything he wants to. 
[00:01:00]  You son of a f**k.  Humber County officials say a woman was hit and killed by another vehicle.  Pierce died at the scene.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning to everybody.  Hello.  Drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, finally.  You know, see, I start a trend.  Anthony went off in the office.  They're ripping me off.  Front page of the morning rag.  Why USA must drill.  And that's by Newt Gingrich.  Newt Gingrich.  He must listen to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:02:00]  He heard me.  But who the hell's listening to Newt Gingrich these days?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What does he do?  He writes articles.  He does rights now?  I guess so.  Gives speeches.  The headline, no reason we can't get cheaper oil.  Just drill.  Isn't that what I said?  Yeah, you've been saying that for a while.  Just start putting holes in the planet, please.  Can we?  There's plenty of oil down there.  Just get it.  Scoop it up. 
[00:02:30]  If there's plenty of oil down there, why haven't we gotten our own oil?  Too many environmentalists getting all...  Ooh, no drilling.  No, our ancestors were lazy.  What?  The environmentalist thing is a new phenomenon.  Yeah.  Since, like, 1972.  Really?  Yeah.  And we were using...  Is that when they came in?  And we were using the Earl way before 1972.  So why didn't we drill before now? 
[00:03:00]  There used to be oil wells all over the place in this country.  Drill, drill, drill.  And they got lazy.  And they shut down a bunch of refineries because of the tree huggers.  And now we're screwed.  So open them back up.  Build more refineries and start drilling holes in the planet.  This planet's full of oil.  And another idea I have is we go just into international waters off of the Middle East, right? 
[00:03:30]  Then we drill sideways on an angle and suck up oil that's underneath, like Saudi Arabia, by drilling in sideways.  I like the sideways.  Yeah.  We'll give it to them sideways.  I told you.  That's what I say.  I told you in the office.  I said, hey, isn't Saudi Arabia pretty much right below us, give or take?  Or maybe we could do the sideways thing like you're talking. 
[00:04:00]  So we just start drilling a hole until we.  Through the whole planet.  Through the whole planet.  And then let gravity suck all their oil.  Suck it into the middle of the Earth?  Oh, all the way, I'm thinking.  Why would it come out this side?  It would just stop in the middle of the Earth and burn up at the core.  I don't know.  Wow, that kind of creeps me out that gravity all of a sudden reverses somewhere in the middle of the planet.  It goes backwards.  What the hell's going on in the middle of the planet?  How confused are they?  They don't know where gravity goes.  It goes toward the middle of the planet.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  That's it.  So what happens in the middle of the planet?  There's hot magma.  What's up with the gravity down there?  Yeah, it's just ball pulling into there because it's so dense.  Yeah.  So dense in there.  It just pulls everything that way.  So the oil would just get sucked into the middle of the Earth.  I say we go with the water technology.  What's that?  There's another kid that turned his car into like a water car.  Oh, another future dead guy from the government?  I wish I got the audio. 
[00:05:00]  Maybe Danny could find it.  I was watching the news a couple days ago.  Don't listen to it.  They'll get you too.  College kid says, you know, screw this.  It costs him about $10,000 to turn his car into like a water guzzler.  So all he does is pump water into it.  He converted his car to run on water.  So if a college kid is doing this, why can't we be doing this?  How is that possible?  I don't know.  How does it run on water?  Does it separate the hydrogen from the oxygen and then just burn hydrogen? 
[00:05:30]  I'm not a scientist.  Is that it?  I'm barely a jock.  Well, how does it do that?  Some kind of a fuel cell?  You're making me all nervous here.  I don't know.  I don't have the answer.  See, because it takes some kind of electrical power to do that.  You can't just separate the hydrogen and oxygen out of water without some type of electric.  So where does that power come from?  You know how it works?  It's like you have to rock the car back and forth and the swishing of the water propels you forward. 
[00:06:00]  It propels you forward.  It's not very efficient.  Not very efficient indeed.  Well, we've got to find that story because a college kid, he had it with the gas prices.  He said it cost him about $10,000 to convert his car to run not on gas.  I'm not sure if it's an electric car or a water car.  It might be an electric car now that I think about it.  But he converted it for $10,000.  I can convert it for a lot less than that. 
[00:06:30]  You get those rockets that you used to fill with water and pump up.  Remember those red and white rockets?  I used to love those.  You fill them with water, you pump it up, and then you pull the little trigger and it goes  and you get soaking wet and it goes up and then you lose it and it comes down on your head and hurts.  Because you just put those on the back of your car and you go like maybe two inches per launch  if you have 1,000 of them on the back of your car. 
[00:07:00]  Then you've got to refill them.  So you say drill, drill, drill.  Well, Evan says no, no, no.  Oh.  Evan, New Hampshire.  Really, Evan.  What's up, buddy?  How are we doing?  Good.  It's not that I'm against it.  I've just got a reason why we can't go ahead and do it.  All righty.  Uh, national debt.  We've, uh, we've borrowed a bunch of money from trillions of dollars from oil producing  companies upon the one, uh, the one reason why we can't drill on our own soils.  They, they've lent us all this money upon the basis that, uh, if we go ahead and drill 
[00:07:30]  on our own soils, they're going to go ahead and the world's bank is going to collect the  whole national debt.  If they do that, we'd be a world, uh, third world country in like a month straight.  Would we?  You know what?  No.  Screw other countries holding us hostage for anything anymore.  You know what we do?  We print up a bunch of money and we give them that and go, here, you paid off.  We just print up cha-ching, cha-ching, but give them sheets of cash that came out of the  treasury and then we start drilling. 
[00:08:00]  What are they going to do?  Yeah.  Who are they going to do?  Who would know?  Right.  Who would know?  It's the government.  They, they decide.  So they, here's your money.  They just start printing money and throwing it out there.  Give it out to like, uh, countries, foreign countries.  Yeah.  Who would know in the end?  Our debt's paid.  Our debt's paid.  Whoa.  You print up too much money and the money becomes worthless.  Yeah.  Well, who cares?  How much we owe you?  Know what the government says?  A billion bucks?  Here's a billion.  I know what the government says at that point.  Prove that we printed up a lot more money.  Right.  How do you prove it?  Prove it. 
[00:08:30]  What are you going to count every dollar that's out there?  It's just out there.  It's out there.  Most of it is just never spent.  It's sitting in someone's pocket anyway.  Yeah.  But mattress, a bank somewhere that no one sees it.  Right.  Who's counting all the dollar bills out there?  Let's collapse the economy.  Let's all just, uh, uh, I don't know, not spend money today.  Yeah.  No one spend a dime.  Okay.  All right.  And let's see what happens.  Let's talk broker Jimmy.  Give us some, uh, some ideas.  I'm coughing.  What happened, Jimmy?  Did you get a little, uh, a seven whole grain puff down your throat? 
[00:09:00]  I feel like it's popcorn from last night.  I got like a little thing.  Ooh.  Oh, a kernel?  Why were you having popcorn last night, Jimmy?  Was it movie night?  Speculate, speculate, speculate.  Yeah.  Was it movie night?  Oh, poor Jimmy.  Oh, no.  He's really hacking.  You want the Heimlich maneuver?  Yeah.  That ain't gonna help.  I like that even when I don't need it.  Kenny!  Jimmy needs the Heimlich!  I've never seen someone giving the Heimlich and seen AIDS come out, so. 
[00:09:30]  Give little Jimmy the Heimlich.  I don't think this will work because I'm not choking on it.  It's just lodged in my flesh.  Oh, just do it for the radio show.  Just do it for the radio show.  It's lodged.  Look, he's all excited and ready.  I hate popcorn kernels.  I know.  They're painful.  They stick in places.  It's like Velcro.  Yeah.  Oh, a little Heimlich.  You seem all right.  You seem all right.  I don't care.  I'm not giving you a...  All right, he doesn't need the Heimlich.  It was just his presence.  So why were you having popcorn last night, Jimmy?  I eat it.  If I'm in a snack at night, I'll try to eat low-fat popcorn. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, there's a story behind it?  Wow.  Isn't that cute?  Hoping there was some kind of nice story attached to the popcorn stuck in your throat.  What it was, I kept eating, and then because I was writing, I had to keep wiping my hands.  Oh, on your shirt?  I wouldn't get grease on my keyboard.  So you had a greasy shirt on?  Yes.  My hog smells like popcorn.  So where were we?  Drilling, drilling, drilling.  Yes.  Yes.  Just drill. 
[00:10:30]  What is this?  There's a website?  Yeah.  Go to...  That teaches you how to do that?  Let's say hi to Bill in Bayshore.  Hello, Bill.  No, Phil.  Bill.  Hello, Phil.  Phil.  Phil Connors?  No, not Phil Connors.  What's the other name from that groundhog?  Ned Ryerson.  Ned Ryerson?  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  Love that movie.  What's up, Bill?  All right, Phil.  There's a website called runyourcaronwater.com, and they tell you the plans to build a hydrogen 
[00:11:00]  fuel cell to run your car on water.  And where does the power come from?  It separates the molecules in the water and lines them up.  And I'm no scientist, but my father-in-law is a crazy bastard.  I didn't think you were a scientist.  You didn't really have to say that.  Phil from Bayshore, the scientist.  Yeah.  Dr. Mook.  Dr. Mook.  That's it, Jimmy. 
[00:11:30]  I've never heard.  Avenue Science Plain.  Hey.  I don't think any scientist came out of Bayshore, my friend.  No.  The science of getting chick's hair real high.  All right.  All right.  So we'll go to runyourcaronwater.com, and then we'll have the feds knocking at our door  later today.  Yeah.  Basically, yeah.  They have interviews of a guy who built the car and then mysteriously died somewhere along  the line.  They don't know how he died.  Oh, where have you been, Phil? 
[00:12:00]  It's one of our favorite stories on the Opie Anthony show.  The dope dad has to brag that he has discovered a way to run a car without using gas.  Figured it out, and the military's coming to visit me because they're interested in my  idea.  And then he's out to dinner, and he frigging chokes.  Yeah.  Then there's some kind of salmonella thing that leads to brain cancer.  And liver's being removed.  Ah, there we go.  Okay.  Man beats high gas price with electric car. 
[00:12:30]  Is this the college kid?  Yeah.  A college student.  If you could get the audio, it's pretty fun, too.  Yeah, I would.  Thank you.  My resources are important.  Thank you, Phil.  Here's the story.  A college student in Glendale, Arizona, has found his way to get to school without using  a drop of gas, and he's laughing all the way to the bank.  Do people do that the whole way?  I've chuckled during about a quarter mile of the drive to the bank.  And you've still got 10 miles to go.  I've chuckled.  I've never laughed the entire way to the bank.  And when do you stop? 
[00:13:00]  When you get there, when you walk through the front door.  You've got to give it one.  Ah, at the end.  Ah.  Ah.  I always stop when I'm backing into a spot, because whenever I laugh and back in, I tend  to run children's feet over.  Which makes you laugh more.  Well, we've got this kid laughing all the way to the bank.  Ricky Suter said he bought a 1992 Saturn.  Mm-hmm.  Rockin', man.  Real chicken mobile.  And spent about $10,000 to convert it to an electric vehicle. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, this is what I was seeing on TV.  All electric.  Suter said he partly did it for environmental reasons, but he mostly did it because it  was fun.  He calls it his hobby.  Yeah, that's some hobby.  This geek never gets out.  Suter said his electric ride can get up to 75 miles per hour on the highway and can hold  enough of a charge to get him from his home in Glendale to Tempe and back.  That's got to be, what, 10, 12 miles?  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  The car's about as no maintenance as it gets, as Suter claims. 
[00:14:00]  He doesn't have to do oil changes or tune-ups.  He said he occasionally adds some distilled water to the batteries, but even that is cheap.  Suter said distilled water only costs about 40 cents per gallon.  So it's an electric car.  It's not a water car.  All right.  I wasn't sure if it was water or electric.  Oh, okay.  I want to know about the water car.  The water car is definitely happening.  It goes 35 miles between charges.  35 miles, this guy goes.  35 lousy miles?  What a creep. 
[00:14:30]  That's it.  Keep your electric piece of crap.  Top speed 80, 35 miles range.  Oh, wow.  It's convenient.  He's almost...  It's not convenient.  He almost got up to 40 miles before he had to recharge it.  Can you imagine, though, if the company actually did this?  Like, I mean, he's doing this galt with an awful vehicle, but, you know, they could obviously...  Yeah, but if it's just a college kid turning his 1992 car into an electric car, come on.  How hard could it be to, you know, do the right thing and get our bills down? 
[00:15:00]  I actually think what they should do is invent a car that runs on a Bunsen burner.  The Bunsen burner.  You have to hire someone just to continually sit in the back and light it.  I hated the Bunsen burner.  Trying to get laid and you just hear them going, flick, flick, flick.  Stupid Bunsen sitting there.  This is my burner.  So you want to drill everywhere.  Drill.  Drill, drill.  Because we're being held hostage with oil prices. 
[00:15:30]  These high oil prices, they're not going down.  They're not going down anytime soon.  You know, premium gas is now at an all-time low for purchasing.  And regular is at not an all-time low, but very low.  And no one's buying premium.  You know how you're supposed to buy a new car and put premium in it?  No one's doing that now.  Everyone's pumping regular in.  Why would you use premium gas ever?  Because the manufacturer says to.  Of course they say to.  Because they're in cahoots.  Are they in cahoots? 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  Are they in collusion?  No one keeps their car long enough for the premium gas to be effective.  I use premium.  Yeah, but by the time it would matter, you're going to be onto a new car.  No, I notice a difference in performance.  What?  You get an extra half mile per hour?  No, you don't get the knocking when you take off and the acceleration's better.  It's minimal.  It's just noticed.  It's for gearheads like yourself.  The average person wouldn't know the difference. 
[00:16:30]  Come on.  But that's an all-time low.  So why aren't, because demand is down, that means the price of oil should go down.  But it's not.  They had another surge yesterday.  Let's go to Taylor in Jersey because you were talking about laughing all the way to the bank, Anthony.  Yes.  So Taylor has something on that.  Taylor.  Hey, morning, boys.  How are you?  Good.  Hey, Ann.  I saw the ex-wife running into the bank the other day.  She was laughing the whole way.  Ow.  Ow. 
[00:17:00]  Ouch.  Oh, that's not nice.  She set up an oil rig outside the bank and drilled sideways into the vault and gets my money.  Lots and lots and lots.  All right, we've got to take our first break.  We're off to a very good start.  We've got Louis C.K. stopping by to say hi.  We've got Otto from Otto and George stopping by.  Equally nice.  He's to the point where he leaves that stupid puppet of his home and comes in and just entertains the hell out of us.  I wonder if Otto will show up or George.  Which one? 
[00:17:30]  He probably has to tell George that he can't come in and there's a whole thing that he has to do.  You think they fight before he leaves the house?  Oh, yeah.  Like, oh, I don't get to go anywhere with you anymore.  Yeah.  You've got to stay home, George.  And Pat from Munaki.  It's Pat from Munaki Day today.  Oh, it certainly is.  We're going to get him and a porn star doing a little something something today.  Yeah, you know, whatever happens.  Oh, whatever happens.  A little something something.  Maybe champagne cocktails. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Pat from Munaki, of course, is the star of the Baby Bird video that's still doing very, very well.  On those viral video websites.  Uh-huh.  So we're getting him a little action today.  And more of your phone calls.  877-212-018.  Oh, before we go to break, a big thank you to everybody listening to this fine radio station  in New York City.  Yes.  We are.  There's new ratings.  There's old ratings.  The new ratings take effect in a couple months.  But they're kind of already using the new ratings. 
[00:18:30]  And the Opie and Anthony show, number one across the board with men.  And actually going up with the female.  So if you've got boobies and you're listening to us, we greatly appreciate it.  Those numbers are moving up higher than we've ever seen in our careers, by the way.  Yeah.  But the men numbers, ridiculous.  The way it works with the new ratings, by the way, is they just stand outside with a pen  and ask every single person that walked by, what are you listening to, what are you listening to, what are you listening to, what are you listening to?  The dumb old ratings that are so primitive are finally going away in a month or two. 
[00:19:00]  And this new rating system that we happen to do very well with is going to be official.  Yep.  But, wow, we did very well yesterday.  Very happy.  Thank you.  So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  How many?  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  One for every person.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Yes, keep going.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Ding, ding.  Love this riff.  The doors, peace frog. 
[00:19:30]  I can't listen to the doors, though.  Why?  I'm just so damn sick of every doors hit.  Well, that's the problem.  You've got to go a little deeper in the catalog.  Oh, I don't want to.  You go deeper in the catalog, it's just him whining.  Oh, no, no, no, not that big.  When the earth rises up.  Anyway, oh, his stupid spoken word garbage with music behind him.  Yeah, that's a little too deep.  A little too deep?  I'm talking just a little deeper than the hits that rock radio plays. 
[00:20:00]  So overrated.  Not to the point where the Bluebird lands.  You cannot petition the Lord with prayer.  Oh, can you?  What?  I cannot stand Jim Morrison.  I hate the doors.  I think they're one of the most overrated bands that came out of a drugged out decade.  You know what?  Do this yourself.  Decod.  Do this yourself.  What?  You're a big doors fan?  That's right, man. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  You don't like the end?  That's a good song.  This is the, uh, I liked it in Apocalypse.  It was good during the, um, the closing credits where they showed a bunch of napalm going off.  That was kind of...  How about, uh, five to one?  No.  A song rock radio doesn't play a lot.  How about Back Door Man?  I like that one.  I hate that.  How about a little Waiting for the Sun?  Yeah, Roadhouse.  We're going to the Roadhouse.  We're going to have a real good time.  Those are the ones they overplay on rock radio.  Save our city. 
[00:21:00]  This is the second level of the doors that they don't play a lot.  Waiting for the Sun.  Five to one.  Waiting.  Peace Frog.  They don't play.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  For this song to end.  Waiting.  Waiting for you to...  Anytime the doors come on and I switch it off, and then I listen to three or four songs,  and then go back to the station, hoping it's over, it's still going.  Well, because they're still waiting.  Waiting. 
[00:21:30]  Waiting.  Ate it.  Love the doors.  Did you ever get Light My Fire?  What?  Stop.  Oh, that's a good one.  I like that one.  I like Jose Feliciano's version better.  Did you do that?  Let my fire.  Let my fire.  Let my fire.  Let my fire.  Let my fire.  Yeah.  It's awful.  You're talking about beginner doors.  That's beginner doors.  Beginner doors?  Yeah, every band, you know, it's the beginner music, like the, you know, and then you get  into the band, and then you realize they got a lot cooler tunes that radio doesn't play.  Jim Morrison, an American poet, man. 
[00:22:00]  Shut it.  Do you think he got, some people, you think because he died at 27.  Yes!  Yeah.  Oh.  Maybe.  You jumped the gun there.  Oh, sorry.  Do you think maybe they've given him a bit more credit than they have?  More credit than deserved.  Because he died.  Absolutely.  And he died at the same time that he had Jimi Hendrix dying, Joplin dying, and those  two, you know, pretty big impact.  Although I really can't take Janis Joplin either, but.  Really?  Yeah.  You ever hear Mercedes Benz? 
[00:22:30]  The Catterwallin.  Oh!  Shut up.  Sing.  You're not an American, man.  I'm not?  No.  The hell am I?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  Like, uh, Hendrix, some of it is annoying, but, um.  Jim Morrison.  Rules.  Jim Morrison had way more talent than Jimi Hendrix.  What?  Yes.  Crazy.  Couldn't even get a rod.  You're talking crazy.  You're just talking like a crazy person. 
[00:23:00]  All Hendrix had was Purple Haze.  And all on the watchtower.  And also, uh.  But hey, Joe.  And hey, Joe.  And a little Crosstown Traffic.  Crosstown Traffic.  That's all you get with Hendrix.  What was a good one he did?  Exactly.  No, no.  It's a song, uh.  Exactly.  After four songs.  Foxy Lady.  All right.  So.  Ram, ram, ram, ram.  All right.  He had five songs.  Great.  I'll tell you the name of it.  I have it on my app.  The Doors had five songs on their first album that you know and love.  No, I know them.  I don't love them. 
[00:23:30]  Yes, you do love them.  You're forgetting a Hendrix song here.  I don't like them.  Am I?  No, Opias.  I don't like the way Gregorio is just dismissing.  Uh, what?  I don't have it.  I'll just talk about it.  The Wind Cries Mary.  Oh, yeah?  No, that's a good one.  Oh.  I don't love that one.  All right.  Which one?  I don't know.  My iTunes is opening.  Oh.  By the way, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show, 877-212-O-N-A.  Mm-hmm.  Uh.  What?  What?  Oh, manic depression.  Oh, yeah.  Manic depression is pretty cool. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Do you want to know what a fruit I am?  When I was a kid, I thought it would be really cool if I changed my name and spelled a J-I-M-I.  No.  Yeah, I did.  No, you didn't.  I wanted to do that.  No, please just say that was a joke now.  I wasn't a joke.  Ugh.  You tried so hard to be cool, and through that, you were a complete dork.  I was such a...  I really was.  I was awful.  I felt like Jimmy Norton would be cool.  Yeah.  The chicks will dig me.  Yeah, J-I-M-I, man.  Really? 
[00:24:30]  Hey, let's say how to Phil in Tampa.  Phil?  Phil?  Phil?  Phil Connors?  Phil from Poxitani on the phone.  What's up, Phil?  Hey, doesn't your mom like Janice Joplin there?  Well, she certainly does, and when she's drinking, she'll always sing it.  Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.  Nothing.  Don't. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Freedom.  Well, feeling was good enough, Lord, when he sings the blue.  It's the retarded Partridge family.  No feeling good was good enough for me.  Sing it, Mommy.  Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.  Yeah.  Isn't that wonderful?  That's Aunt's mom right there.  That's why I can't stand Janice Joplin either. 
[00:25:30]  Well, your mom sounded kind of like her.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, when she was dying.  Don't you love that Janice showed up to her high school reunion expecting all this love  and it was just humiliating her?  Oh, and they just, yeah, ragged her anyway.  God.  That's what high school's all about.  That's her fault, though.  Huh?  Going back thinking, you know, it's going to be something different.  Was she, like, just hitting fame then?  I think she was pretty famous.  And didn't she cry?  It was a good thing.  I don't know.  Stump brain, you remember it.  It might have been all the drugs in her system. 
[00:26:00]  It's in the movie Pearl.  If you haven't seen that documentary, it's actually pretty touching when she goes over  because she went back to Port Arthur, Texas and was just ripped by her whole high school  and that's kind of what fired her up even more.  Why'd they rip her?  Like, when she was there, because I remember it was like, didn't she kind of dress too crazy  when she was back there?  Yeah, she was nutty back then.  And then she went back to school and she was huge and they still kind of stiffed her  because if you've ever been to Port Arthur, it's kind of backward.  This stunt brain, man, when does he rest his brain?  He doesn't.  He just, he's on all the time, 24-7, 366 days a year because you've got to count the leap 
[00:26:30]  day thing.  Thank you.  It's like I always say, while our brains are napping, his brain's doing push-ups.  That's right.  Stunt brain coming in.  In all fairness, Blaine in South Carolina, big Hendrix fan.  He wants me to go deeper with the Hendrix, so then you've got a little wing, of course,  and Castles Made of Sand is a cool song as well.  So I guess Hendrix did have a...  No, I'm not a big Hendrix fan now that you've mentioned these songs either.  Really?  No.  What the hell did you listen to growing up? 
[00:27:00]  Oh, let's see.  Frankie Valli, the Greaser.  What?  Wasn't that him?  Bobby Vinton?  No, I'm kidding.  Roses are red, my love.  It's Bobby Vinton.  Roses.  No, I listened to Skinnered, man.  That's what I listened to.  Molly Hatchet and Charlie Daniels while drinking whiskey in the woods by the fort.  You loved your Southern rock.  I was a Southern rock guy. 
[00:27:30]  The Outlaws.  Foghat.  Southern rock was country music with an extra guitar.  Marshall Tucker.  That's all that was.  Double leads.  Yeah, that's all that was.  You needed your double leads back then.  If they took one guitar away, it would be considered country music.  Yeah, exactly.  John, Jersey, what's up?  I was just saying, Jim Morrison has more talent than Jimi Hendrix has.  I kind of think absurd.  So, I mean, Jimi Hendrix, you know, practically invented that, you know, not invented, but reinvented that style of guitar and just, he's a little notch under a god to me in my book. 
[00:28:00]  Well, I'll give you the fact that his guitar playing was very influential to a lot of people, but, yeah, I don't want to hear it.  But his songwriting sucked.  Castles made of sand.  I mean, come on.  I could write that crap.  I love going to the beach. 
[00:28:30]  There's a castles made of sand.  I'm going to write a song about it.  And now he stands outside, and all the neighbors start to gossip and drool.  Yeah.  He's a bluesy guy, man.  Yeah.  He cries, oh, girl, you must be mad.  What happened to the sweet love you and me had?  Against the door he leans and starts to see.  Guess when the drugs kicked in.  Ready?  And so castles made of sand.  That doesn't make sense. 
[00:29:00]  That doesn't make sense.  The lead up to that line was okay, and then he goes off the deep end and starts talking  about castles made of sand.  Maybe it's symbolic.  Maybe they're not real castles, they're real sand.  Maybe their relationship is built on a sandy foundation.  Right.  And when the water washes up on the shore.  Washes.  It washes your relationship away.  You want to hear a douche moment at Leonard Skinner?  Yeah.  Oh, please.  I love Jimmy's douche moments. 
[00:29:30]  Jimmy just wanted to fit in growing up.  And now another Jim Norton douchey moment.  We all wanted to fit in when we were growing up, but Jimmy really wanted to fit in.  Oh, he tried so hard on a daily basis.  What was it?  The Kango hat?  Kango hat.  He went through his rap phase, and now he's got a Skinner story.  Go ahead.  I was like the white kid who wanted to be black long before it was fashionable.  Oh, wow.  Fat laces.  There's a song called by Skinner's off Nothing Fancy.  It's actually a great tune.  It's called Am I Losing? 
[00:30:00]  You ever hear that?  Hmm.  Let's see.  Wow.  I don't think I have.  Nobody's ever heard.  That's one of the best songs.  You got it?  This would be Deep Skinner.  Is it really?  Yes.  This was never played on rock radio.  When I used to come home, never had a dime.  Long time.  That sounds like another song.  All right.  Don't recall drinking what I mean.  Yeah, how they convinced rock guys to listen to country music, because that's pretty much 
[00:30:30]  what this is.  Yeah, absolutely.  Am I losing?  It's great.  Way back.  But there's a douchey moment that goes with this very song.  Yeah.  Me and my friend, I think he started, I was drinking, we kind of grew apart as friends.  So this was like our song, because it's about you losing a second.  Yeah.  It's not a romantic.  It's not a romantic song.  No, it's not about that.  It's about a guy.  He's complaining that his friends think he's changed. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  And that was, we kind of felt like we'd grown apart as friends.  So what did you, did you acknowledge this to each other, this song?  Yeah, yeah.  I think he suggested.  Dude, this is like about us.  Yeah.  And you went, yeah.  Yeah.  Ha-la-la-la-la.  Ew.  I don't think I've ever had a song with another guy.  Only this one time.  It doesn't matter.  I didn't make a habit of it.  Do something else once, and then you know what they call you.  Right.  A good friend.  Ha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Ha-la-la-la-la-la-la. 
[00:31:30]  You're losing.  That's a cool-sounding song.  Yeah.  That's why rock radio sucks.  They can't think out of the box.  Yeah.  There's so many cool songs by all these bands we know and love, but they're not, these dumb  programmers aren't brave enough to give you a little sprinkle of the deeper stuff.  We're just losing, you know.  No, man.  We got to.  Touch with each other.  We've got to play Sweet Home Alabama again.  Jimmy, did you guys try to vow to get closer again? 
[00:32:00]  I don't remember.  Or did you just acknowledge that you had kind of grown apart?  Yeah, it was more that because there was nothing swishy.  He's a cop now.  He was like one of those guys where he was kind of nuts.  He was working out before any of us were.  He'd take Polaroids to the screen when Rocky was on,  and he would motivate him to work out.  Really? Polaroids?  A bit cheesy, yeah, but he could punch chromosomes out of your head.  He really just had a retard punch strength. 
[00:32:30]  He's a good man.  I'm getting killed on instant feedback.  Fast Freddy's good for a few every day.  Jamaica Station.  Oh, yeah, the Cinderella fan thinks Morrison is greater than Hendrix.  Okay, I'll go ahead and make a note of that.  Thanks, Opie.  I'm just saying, man, Cinderella got screwed over, man.  They were a really cool band, but when Nirvana hit,  all those bands had to go away,  and Cinderella never had a chance to show their potential.  That's all I'm saying.  Heartbreak Station was an amazing album by Cinderella.  What was the hit from Cinderella?  You sing amazing album by Cinderella? 
[00:33:00]  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  What was the hit?  It's a good song by Skinner.  Just while you're looking at his hair band stuff.  Yeah, but they were doing hair band because that was the genre.  I think the kid had a lot more talent than just throwing him in the hair band category.  Is everybody copying the crew?  Nobody's Fool.  Yeah, let's do a little Nobody's Fool.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  This is so dated.  This is great. 
[00:33:30]  Was this what you were calling great?  From the chant from the band.  They all sounded the same.  All right, mark the day.  I have to change my opinion on Cinderella.  They were just a bunch of hacks, okay?  A bunch of copycats.  Now that I hear this, forget it.  What do you got there, Jimmy?  Oh, no.  Another Skinner song. 
[00:34:00]  I think it's The Ballad of Curtis Lowe.  Oh, that's a great one.  That's a great Skinner song.  That was great, man.  Absolutely.  But then the man died and it all went to pot.  Yeah.  I like Tuesday's Gone.  Yeah, that's great.  I like Call Me the Breeze.  Call Me the Breeze?  Just Call Me the Breeze.  I used to like this girl.  Her last name was Breeze.  So every time Call Me the Breeze was on the radio, it made me think of her man.  Ew, her last name is Breeze?  It's douchey, too.  That's a little douchey. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, it is.  He'll use his Febreze Faber Softener.  Yeah.  Let's get some of those double leads going.  Yeah.  God, listen to that voice.  Come on.  That was amazing.  I'm going to go pick up some Skinner today, I'm thinking.  Play some Skinner, man.  I keep blowing down the road.  What an amazing year.  It was an amazing voice.  I got it to them later in life, too.  I didn't like that when I was younger. 
[00:35:00]  Really?  It was all Kiss and Sabbath, man.  And Ozzy, yeah.  I remember being in high school.  Yeah.  When they died, man.  Yeah.  Oh, Buddy Holly.  Yeah, Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper.  You fool.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, man.  Call me the breeze.  We don't have to do a radio show today.  Let's just listen to tunes.  What, we like the station next door there, CBS? 
[00:35:30]  F CBS.  We'll just crank it up to 10 and leave the door open.  Were you all maudlin' when he died?  He's depressed?  No, I really didn't care, but there were some kids walking around the halls crying.  Dude.  Yeah, but they died at the top of their game.  Yeah.  They weren't on their way down.  They were still on their way up, my friend.  And then they decided to keep the...  Well, then again, they were on their way down.  Oh, ow.  Yeah.  And then they decided to keep the band going with the brother, and that just... 
[00:36:00]  No, they took a long break.  Yeah, yeah.  They had to wait for the little brother to grow up and get through grammar school,  and then they threw him on a stage and said,  all right, you're going to take over for your older brother now.  They actually do a pretty good job.  There's a lot of Skinner fans out there that have no problem with the new lineup.  None whatsoever.  They were inducted the same right at the hall as Sabbath.  They inducted Skinner.  They still get the job done.  They really haven't come out with any songs that rock radio is embracing,  but they're still doing it, man.  I mean, they're lucky.  They were a band that had, what, 17 members, something like that. 
[00:36:30]  They still got, like, seven left.  But the lead singer, of all the people that die,  the lead singer goes like, God almighty, couldn't you have sat somewhere else, idiot?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Kid Rock has a song where he samples a couple of Skinner songs, right?  Yeah, it's his new hit.  Yeah.  What's it called?  Summer Song or something like that?  He's doing country now.  So it's like...  Yeah, we had him in, remember?  Kind of a country song.  Kid Rock was one of...  But it's still, like, you know, Kid Rocky. 
[00:37:00]  Kid Rock was one of the coolest hangs we ever had.  He came in with his guitar and just kind of, like, played for us.  It was awesome.  You find that one yet?  Yeah.  Oh, it's like Warren Zevon and Sweet Home Alabama,  which me and Joe used to do as a goof.  We would go from Sweet Home Alabama into the Warren Zevon song there.  Right.  Yeah, we're all in for London.  I like this better than his rap. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, it almost has a rappy feel to it in a few spots, but...  There's a little Skinner right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Splashing through the sandbar, talking by the campfire.  It's the simple things in life, like when and where.  Yeah, I'll take this over that.  Yeah, it's good.  I like Kid Rock's stuff.  Like, there's old stuff in this.  Oh, cow boy. 
[00:38:00]  No, that stuff was good, man.  I never liked that.  Ba-da-da-ba-da-bang-a-bing-bang.  I love that song.  I want to listen to rap.  I listen to rappers.  I like this.  I just want to hear the hook and we'll move on.  That's a riff in there, yeah. 
[00:38:30]  What's the name of that song?  For the people out there.  All Summer Long.  All Summer Long, that's a good one.  And Mark from Jersey, definitely got to go to him,  because this is the song I was trying to remember.  Go ahead, Mark.  Yeah, this is for Anthony, maybe.  Give Me Back My Bullets.  I remember that one.  Give Me Back My Bullets is one of the best  Leonard Skinner songs ever,  and rock radio does not play this song.  The guy that was going to commit suicide,  maybe that's what he's singing.  Give Me Back My Bullets.  Yeah, we don't have an update on Tom yet, 
[00:39:00]  so I don't know what the hell's going on with him.  We're really trying to find out what's up with him.  He was taken to a hospital after last week's shenanigans.  We haven't heard from him since.  Could you give me a little taste of Give Me Back My Bullets?  Listen to this riff.  I've had the hard times, and the pressure's been on me.  But I'll keep on working like a working man do.  And I've got my ass together, gonna walk all those shoes.  Give Me Back My Bullets. 
[00:39:30]  Nice.  I've done had my fun.  I don't see no more, damn, it's done.  Give Me Back My Bullets.  Nice.  Stupid rock radio.  I was in that world for way too long.  And I would sit there and go, there's so many cooler songs.  Just sprinkle them in. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  I mean, Sweet Home Alabama, Freebird, they're amazing songs.  But come on, go a little deeper with these bands.  I can't listen to Freebird.  I just can't.  Not anymore.  I can't do it.  You know, but I haven't heard Freebird in well over a year.  If it comes on the radio, I'm definitely cranking it.  Really?  It's just an amazing song.  I'm shutting it off.  Back in the day though, man, it was on every other radio station, every other song.  Yeah.  Rock radio stinks.  Mmm, that's a nice assessment. 
[00:40:30]  Meaning that they don't, you're right, they don't go any deeper than, it's annoying.  It's like growing up, I hate it.  Because they're scared.  They hate it growing up.  Because they're scared.  I'm not, honestly.  It doesn't test well.  I like what they play on Can't Rock in New York.  I didn't like it before at all, but now I turn it on, I'll hear Metallica.  And it's not the exact same song you always hear, which is nice.  Wait, they play music after we're off the air?  Yes.  In the office.  But I actually like it.  I am so sick of it. 
[00:41:00]  Any W I couldn't listen to growing up.  Every time I turned it on, it was the same Who song.  Right.  Bravo to this radio station here in New York.  They did very well around the clock.  Good.  They're moving up.  I guess that's the thing to do, just have a radio station without a PD, and then you  get the ratings.  We don't have a PD.  We don't have a general manager.  Research is flawed.  That's why independent projects like films are so good.  Because what they do is they get these focus groups, and they, what did you like?  What did you object to? 
[00:41:30]  What bothered you?  The fact that they would listen to a focus group, instead of their own instincts as creative  people, shows you what little dummies are running entertainment.  Yeah.  Hey, I got to go to Paul in Yonkers.  Paul.  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  You guys got nothing today, do you?  No.  What?  Paul, let me tell you.  Are you insane?  Paul, let me tell you something.  The instant feedback is flying by.  People are commenting on this break.  The phones, am I lying? 
[00:42:00]  Every line is lit.  They want to talk music.  This has been my favorite 20 minutes on the radio all week long.  Do you understand something?  Right here.  Paul.  Right here.  Paul.  What music is better talking about music?  Paul, Paul, do you understand we're just kind of talking about what we listened to growing  up, and other people are, and musical taste, and what?  It's three guys sitting at a kitchen table with a couple beers, talking about the music.  Paul, you just described our show.  That's what the show is.  Thank you.  Sometimes it's music, sometimes it's sex, sometimes it's politics. 
[00:42:30]  Thank you.  That's what this show is, dummy.  Thank you.  You don't get the show.  Please leave.  Goodbye, Paul.  Please leave.  Leave the show.  Am I lying?  Look at this.  We were talking about gas.  No one called the show.  We were talking about the Celtics yesterday.  No one's calling the show.  This is the most action we've had on the phones and instant feedback all week, and it's my  favorite break of the week.  People don't have much passion about music.  Just hang and talking about music.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Let's talk about whatever we feel like talking about, and if you don't like it, here's what 
[00:43:00]  you do.  Remove your clothes and throw yourself through a window.  That's my advice.  Or leave the clothes on.  You know what?  I'm going to tell you what my favorite song out there is right now.  I say you play the whole thing, and we sing along with it, and we talk about the words.  Listen to the words.  I got a bunch of favorite songs out there, but I got to go with Duffy, Mercy.  I got to go with Duffy.  It's the catchiest song out there right now.  Who's Duffy? 
[00:43:30]  I've seen the Starbucks CD.  Have you heard Mercy?  No.  This will be on your iPod by the end of the day.  You really haven't heard Mercy.  No.  Give me a little Mercy.  Mercy.  Me either. 
[00:44:00]  This has gone well.  It's Amy Winehouse-ish.  Tomorrow's got me all my teeth.  It sounds like a song that was recorded in the 60s.  Good though.  Oh, this is new?  Yeah.  Brandy.  She was new.  Duffy, she's eating vomit.  I don't know what you do, but you do it.  Yeah, this sounds like some old school. 
[00:44:30]  Ike Turner should be beating her.  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like.  Sounds like Aretha Franklin, right?  Yeah, something.  A little Aretha Franklin in there?  What do you think, Jimmy?  Very good.  It's definitely very, very catchy.  Yeah.  It's got like a little, it does have a 60s vibe to it. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Really fast, because Steven Long Island reminded me, he writes 38 specials, Simple Man.  38 specials was the poor man's Leonard Skinner.  Yeah.  They really...  38 specials.  Don't listen to them.  They had a million hits, but they were like poppy Skinner'd.  Right, Ant?  Yeah.  Caught up in you.  It was Skinner'd a little more pop to it.  Right.  I'm trying to remember.  They had a million hits for like two or three years. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  They were just all over the place, but they were like a poor man's Skinner.  Yep.  Like a poppy, like...  What?  It was a big song.  It was a big song.  They had quite a few hits.  I can't remember anymore.  It was Caught Up in You.  It was the only one that comes to mind.  Oh, hold on.  Loosely is the big one.  Yeah, that was a big one.  You know Hold On Loosely.  Yeah, I don't think I liked it.  No.  Hold on, Loosely.  Shut up.  You like Boston if they were hillbillies.  This 38 special is If Boston and Leonard Skinner'd Had Sex. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  This is the offspring of Boston and Leonard Skinner'd having sex.  Yeah, definitely.  At the time, though, you'd listen to this.  Huh?  At the time, you'd listen to this.  I wouldn't.  Yeah?  No.  No?  When it was on?  What?  No.  I don't know.  I wanted to see my live Children of the Grave.  Ooh.  Which they never showed. 
[00:46:30]  Certain MTV VJs would play certain music.  Like Martha Quinn's Stunk.  She never played Aussie.  I would always know which MTV.  JJ Johnston was okay.  Or Jackson.  Whatever his name is.  JJ Johnston.  There's three J's in it.  Oh, you could call me Ray.  Yeah.  Oh, you could call me Jay.  But don't call me N.  I was actually a fan of Nina Whitewood myself.  I like Nina Whitewood.  You know, it's funny with Nina Blackhead. 
[00:47:00]  What was so great about her was...  Did he say JJ Johnston?  JJ Johnston.  I said that, right?  I was wrong.  Yes.  Come on, Jimmy.  That's funny.  Nina Blackhead.  She got beaten in a movie called Vice Squad by Wings Houser.  Wings Houser, yeah.  She played a pimp, and her name was Ginger.  And he said, just open the door, Ginger.  And she's like, you ain't gonna hurt me, Ramrod.  Oh, where's the scene?  Ramrod, Ginger.  Beats her to death with a pimp stick.  It's great.  It's great. 
[00:47:30]  Fantastic.  She's on one of the 80s channels, I guess, over on Sirius.  And, God, she doesn't sound good.  Oh, really?  Her voice is all like this now.  It's like watching Lucille Ball from I Love Lucy and then some of those Johnny Carson interviews.  Where she was all, Ricky.  And then it was, well, Johnny.  Me and Desi.  Desi, he was the architect of the three-camera shoot.  Can I have another Winston? 
[00:48:00]  Winston.  Let's say hi to Brian in Jersey.  Brian.  Hey, Opie, you shouldn't be allowed to talk music ever again, man.  You like that garbage, but you rip on Springsteen.  Whoa!  Yeah, Springsteen.  Springsteen.  Singing everything about Jersey.  Enough about Jersey there, Bruce.  Cares.  Holy mother of God.  What happened?  Who is that?  That's Ozzy from 19...  Oh, God.  When was he doing the perm hair, Jimmy? 
[00:48:30]  That looks like Ozzy from the Ultimate Centaur.  Thank you.  Or a Robert Plant marionette doll.  Robert Plant, after he left Zeppelin, started wearing his hair like that.  That's Nina Blackman now.  She looks like porcelain.  She's awful.  There's so much makeup on her face.  Mm-hmm.  By the way, yes, Simple Man by Skinner, if you want to keep going with the deeper tracks.  Mike in Buffalo, listening on the edge.  The home of Shred and Reagan.  Shred and Reagan.  Shred and Reagan. 
[00:49:00]  What's up, Mike?  Yeah, you guys are, like, banging it right on the nose with the songs that are overlooked.  There's one that, like, I believe no one ever knew, like, was so sweet.  It was more zombie-ish, like George Romero-type.  Like, it was Animal Magnetism by the Scorpions.  It was one of the hotter songs that, like, people totally overlooked.  Yeah, but they had to play, no one like you!  Yeah, a million times.  Yeah, like some more pop-like songs.  I like, uh, one of my favorite Scorpions tunes is, uh, The Zoo. 
[00:49:30]  The Zoo.  That was pretty cool.  That's a good one.  I like Winds of Change.  On rocks.  Winds of Change.  All right, we get it.  There's an iron curtain.  You want it down.  What about Gorky Gorky?  God, every friggin' song of theirs.  All right, you're oppressed.  I understand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there was a time that every band had to, you know, sing about the Iron Curtain, man.  You know, the nuclear war.  Or nuclear war.  Yeah, that's what it was.  No nukes.  Or the Russians.  Yeah.  Let's sing about the Russians. 
[00:50:00]  We want our freedom, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, this song's, uh, The Hook is really good, isn't it?  We got to sing about communism.  Yeah.  Take down that wall.  Man.  Yeah.  Yeah, Scorpions.  And you'd have to correct people when they say the Scorpions.  You'd go, no.  It's just Scorpions.  There's no the.  Stop it.  Scorpions?  I would always say the Scorpions.  No, it's just Scorpions.  The world's a way. 
[00:50:30]  The world's a way.  Damn it.  He would sound so funny in some of the songs because, you know, barely spoke English.  Especially at first.  Is he Russian?  Yeah, I think he's a kraut, isn't he?  I guess.  Something like that.  You know what song I heard?  It's speaking of krauts.  And we used to love this song.  I heard it for the first time in years that, uh, Rammstein.  Rammstein.  Or Rammstein.  Yeah, whatever.  Duhas.  Could you give me a little Duhas as we could have a break? 
[00:51:00]  This thing just makes you want a goose step to work, man.  Duhas.  Could you give me a little Duhas?  Duhas, man.  Duhas, man.  And then bring us back to 99 Luftballons.  Listen to this thing, man.  Tell me this doesn't want to make you, like, just smash your boss's head in.  This was, uh, Duhas.  You could not drive slower than 110 when this song came on, either.  Duhas.  It just felt like blitzkrieging a country. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  Duhas.  Wait for it to kick in.  Duhas.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to go to break with just a little taste of this.  Yes.  And we'll continue.  877-2120-08.  But it's getting ready to kick in.  Duhas.  Duhas.  Duhas.  Duhas.  Yeah.  Duhas.  Duhas.  Duhas, man.  This would play and Jews would just run away.  This sounds like gay club music almost.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  You could just picture, like, hundreds of thousands of Nazis marching to this.  Oh, absolutely.  Goose-stepping.  This is, like, the soundtrack to Nuremberg if they won the war.  Duhas.  Du hast mich.  Du hast mich.  Yeah.  Du hast mich gefragt.  Du hast mich gefragt.  Du hast mich gefragt.  Du mich hab nicht gesagt.  Duhas.  Du, du, until death to selber. 
[00:52:30]  Be of time to have forever.  Beserker.  Never.  Would you like to make the.  Beserker.  They even try to sing in English.  They can't do it.  And I'm a truth to say I'm sorry.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We're really late.  That was our musical segment.  My favorite segment of the week right here. 
[00:53:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple things to keep in mind.  Mike Myers stopping by tomorrow.  Very, very excited to talk to Mike Myers.  Been reading up on him.  And a very, very interesting cat.  Let's call him a cat. 
[00:53:30]  An interesting cat.  He's promoting his new movie.  And he decided to do our radio show.  The only radio show he's doing in America.  We're pretty flattered that he has trusted us to come on and promote his new movie.  We're all huge fans.  New Coke Logic animation up on onaradio.com.  What's that about?  Is it a good one?  Really?  It's Roland doing the news.  Oh, no kidding.  It's very good.  Okay.  Go to onaradio.com to check out the latest Coke Logic animation. 
[00:54:00]  You could also vote for your virus comics at virusvote.com.  We got to like nail down that lineup in the very near future.  We were talking about music during the last break.  I want to redeem myself, although I still have no problem telling people I really love that Mercy song by Duffy.  Now we're going to do like staff picks.  There's another song that I was reminded of that I really, really like that's out right now.  And it's a song by the Raconteurs.  And they're doing kind of a Robert Plant thing because Robert Plant decided not to do Robert Plant anymore. 
[00:54:30]  So someone has to do it.  It's a song called These Stones Will Shout, I believe.  It's off the Raconteurs new album.  I just want to give you a little piece.  And then it's going to be Anthony's turn and then Jimmy's turn.  And whoever else around here wants to turn the audience on to a new song.  But this is mine for today.  It's called These Stones Will Shout.  Just a piece.  The Raconteurs.  The Raconteurs. 
[00:55:00]  The Raconteurs.  The Raconteurs.  Grab hold and do not let go. 
[00:55:30]  Grab hold and do not let go.  Very Zeppelin.  Very Zeppelin II-ish.  Wait, which Zeppelin album was the acoustic?  A lot of acoustic stuff.  Was it two or three?  Now I'm getting confused.  Led Zeppelin's Doorway to Elizabeth.  It was a small album they did.  If you didn't know any better, when you say this is like a lost track from Zeppelin, seriously. 
[00:56:00]  I still think it is.  Really?  Speak to me and don't speak softly.  Talk to me and let me know.  Grab hold of my shoulder and tell me.  Grab hold and do not let go.  The only difference is that he can do this live.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like I said, Robert Plant stopped being Robert Plant somewhere along the way.  I guess he got bored with being a rock god or whatever. 
[00:56:30]  Robert Plant went to some, it was in the paper today, went to some photo exhibit of old rock.  Like ruin.  Yeah, I go there all the time.  I have my eye on Kurt Cobain.  Really?  Have you ever checked it out?  No.  The Morrison Hotel?  The Morrison Hotel, there's a couple locations now here in Manhattan.  No.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  That's okay.  He went and would not go into the part that had the Led Zeppelin exhibit. 
[00:57:00]  He looked at everything else but wouldn't walk in there.  And some people overheard him talking about, oh, he's too old now.  Like he didn't want to go in there and see himself as a young guy.  He didn't want to see himself as a young guy with a big bulge.  Now he can't see the bulge because he's got a paunch.  A paunch.  He's a bit paunchy.  Right.  He wants to remember himself being young with a bulge.  The young studly lead singer.  It's a great place, this Morrison Hotel.  All these old school rock photos. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, man.  You got like the Who and the Rolling Stones and their private jets just hanging out.  And it's great.  It's worth going down with Jill.  Oh.  Go down to Soho and make a little afternoon of it.  Yeah.  Check out the photographs at the Morrison Hotel and then maybe get a little cappuccino.  One of those sidewalk cafes.  I bought two Richard Pryors from them and an Aussie photo.  A brilliant original Aussie photo.  Like 1973 or whatever.  What did that run you?  A lot. 
[00:58:00]  Really?  With the framing and stuff, yeah.  Really?  I think they're a bit on the expensive side myself, but I don't go with art.  I don't want an art, a painting.  Look!  It's a bunch of dots on a flower that means it doesn't make an Aussie photo and beat it.  Your whole apartment is just covered with photos then.  Stuff I like.  You don't have a painting of anything?  No.  For what?  I don't know.  Oh, that half-smiling fat bitch.  The motor.  Is he going into it?  I don't care.  Hopefully it's a suicidal depression she was sinking into. 
[00:58:30]  She's a plain Jane and she can hit the bricks.  That's what Mona Lisa was.  Beat it, you non-smiling.  Jim Norton art critic.  She's a plain Jane.  If it ain't Rockwell, it ain't art.  That's what I always say.  You like the Norman Rockwell?  Of course I do.  Little red-headed kid at the doctor's office?  Look, he's looking into the mirror.  He's painting himself.  That's a Norman for you.  Americana.  I'm with Jimmy.  Except for the Pablo Picasso stuff.  He's a queer.  You like that stuff?  I liked his blue face.  He went through a blue face. 
[00:59:00]  Did he?  Yeah.  He was very blue.  It's where he'd paint a big block with blue eyes on the side of it and a nose.  People would go, what's he thinking?  I don't know.  I suck?  That's what he should be thinking.  I'm talking about Pablo.  Or Jimmy Art Reviews.  I like this.  Yeah, but I'm talking about Pablo Picasso before he decided to put a third eye on the face  or put the mouth on the cheek.  Before he started getting into that phase.  Did he think he laughed when he made that and went, this is ridiculous?  Look up Pablo Picasso. 
[00:59:30]  I think the piece is called Old Guitars.  I would hang that on my wall in a second.  I would sell it.  I like Salvador Dali and his melting clocks.  Was that him?  With the melting clocks?  Why?  How hot is it in there?  Yeah.  It's got to be hot.  Old guitar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pop up old guitar.  I like the scream.  Yeah, that one's all right.  You like the scream?  You would.  How could you not?  It's so creepy.  That's a great one.  That's a horrific painting. 
[01:00:00]  There you go.  That is.  Yeah, it's good.  That is cool to me.  That's an old guy.  He's all bent over.  What's he doing, though?  He's still trying to get his art going.  That's what I see.  It looks like someone we know.  Who?  Oh, with the beard!  Oh!  What?  Kidding.  It's Billy Bats.  Good fellas.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  But in all honesty, it is kind of a dumb painting.  It doesn't look like it.  The guy's sitting all awkward and he's bent over.  It's like just drawing a man regular.  He would never play a guitar like that.  No, or sit that way.  Because he's an old artist and he's still doing his art right up to his death. 
[01:00:30]  I think that's a very cool painting.  He doesn't look like a person.  It's extremely cool because it doesn't matter how old you are, he's still trying to create.  That's what I see there.  How about this?  He never gave up.  He's still creating.  Right to his deathbed.  Norman Rockwell, the runaway.  The kid's running with the cop's big fat asses on the seat.  And he's questioning the tot.  That's a good photo.  A good painting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's art.  Americana.  If it doesn't look like someone, it's not art. 
[01:01:00]  You like American Gothic with the old couple there and the guy with the pitchfork?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look at that.  At the malt shop.  I see a pedophile in that photo.  Jeez.  You know, I know it's Americana, this Norman Rockwell, but there's some funny business going  on with that kid.  I don't know.  Either the soda guy behind the counter or the cop.  Something bad is going on there.  You can tell.  The kid's running away.  Right.  Because he's got the little bandana on a stick with his goods in there. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  And he's sitting at the malt shop and the cop is trying to talk him out of it in a nice  sweet way.  Yeah.  With his hand in his lap.  Yeah.  The old guy runs the counter.  He's kind of sitting there with his hands on the counter.  He's smoking.  I mean, and it looks like a photograph of real people.  Yeah.  That's art.  That captures a moment in time right there.  Not the guy with the goddamn spina bifida playing the guitar.  It's just, I don't get most of it. 
[01:02:00]  Mona Lisa is a decent painting, but very overrated.  What was she thinking?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Is she smiling?  Who was she?  I hope she's thinking, please make me hotter than I am in real life while you're painting  me.  Yeah.  That's what she got.  Quite a dog.  What a dog.  Some say it was, what's his name in drag?  He was painting himself.  I don't believe it.  Da Vinci?  Mm-hmm.  Just some fat chick.  He was banging.  He probably said, I'll paint you if you throw me a little.  I think he was knocking a piece off.  Yeah.  And then as she was sitting there, she started to itch. 
[01:02:30]  And she's like, I shouldn't have done that.  This stinks.  Hey, you can't talk great music without talking about foundry and pendulums.  Of course.  I just want to acknowledge that because a few people are out there.  Stephen Carr, the lead singer, probably one of the best voices of our time.  Let's say hi to Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on, man?  Remember back in the day where you had your lead jacket and you went to the Filipino kid  to paint your favorite album on the back of it? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But it was always like the Filipino kid, man, because the white kids couldn't do it.  Let me tell you.  Plain, simple, V-H.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  That's what I had.  It was nothing cooler than the Van Halen logo back then.  Nothing cooler than the way that looked.  That's exactly what I had to do.  Easy to draw on your notebook.  Yeah.  I liked drawing the Who logo.  Did you?  It was easy.  You just had to put that pointy thing over the O. 
[01:03:30]  But so-so.  Over the O.  Yeah, man.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Jason.  I was a more army jacket guy, though, in school than denim.  I was like, we all had to wear our army jackets and we sewed on our little stripes.  You know?  Some of us just had private stripes.  I just had a private stripe.  Other kids decided they were going to make themselves sergeants for no reason.  There was no hierarchy.  You got a promotion by just buying more stripes and sewing them on your stupid army jacket. 
[01:04:00]  And I was lazy.  I just put private on there.  I didn't care.  I didn't need to be.  I should have gotten like major clusters or something.  I would say private is much cooler than being a sergeant in high school.  Sergeant, you're trying too hard.  Private, you're in the back.  No one expects much of you.  You're just smoking some weed.  I would walk around in dress blues.  Dress blues.  Like an officer yelling at the people that they weren't buttoned up properly. 
[01:04:30]  Like officer gentleman.  I might dress navy whites.  Walk into a classroom and take a girl out in your arms.  Yes, I would demand.  You go, girl.  I would demand DORs.  Drop on request.  I love when stupid David Keith hangs himself.  Oh, what a dummy.  Swallows the ring and hangs himself.  D-O-R.  Let's say hi to Jason. 
[01:05:00]  Everybody's swallowing.  He was good as Dax, as the Drak alien.  Of course.  Hated that movie.  It was awful.  Hated it.  I'm gargling with buttermilk while you're talking.  It's distracting, alien.  Jason in Jersey.  What's up, buddy?  Not much.  What's going on this morning?  I used to download a lot of illegal songs, and I found a lot of cool stuff.  There's a Metallica song that's never had any airplay because it's too dirty.  Master of Puppets? 
[01:05:30]  What?  No, So What?  Yeah, So What's a great song.  The song title, So What?  Yeah.  That was one of their closing songs, actually, in Bonnaroo.  Yeah, they love playing that song.  There's also a whole genre of stuff.  It's called punk covers.  And one of the great bands that does that is Me First and the Gimme Gimme.  They take a lot of these 80s tunes, and then they punk them up.  But it's not so punk that it's death metal punk or anything, but they really rock them up.  Like John Denver's Country Roads and a bunch of other songs that are just completely redone that make them to today's type of music, or more like the mid-90s type music. 
[01:06:00]  Do you know what I've been enjoying lately?  If you must mention John Denver and his ill-fated plane-building expedition, I enjoy Thank God I'm a Country Boy.  The live version of that is great.  No, you don't.  I do.  Really?  It's on my iPod.  I work out to it.  What's your favorite...  How do you get into that?  How do you not?  Because it's like old-school country, kind of. 
[01:06:30]  I do have kind of a country song that I'm kind of liking.  I think I've been influenced by going to Nashville.  What?  It was a country song.  It's kind of funny.  It's that Brad Paisley guy.  Okay.  And it's I'm a guy.  I'm just a guy.  It's a new country song?  Yeah, yeah.  Can we get a piece of that?  It's a new country song.  And it's a bit of humor to it.  The guy's got a good voice.  And he's very popular.  You rock looking for us? 
[01:07:00]  It's probably spelled Paisley.  P-A-Y-Z-E.  Oh, by the way, a quick side note.  When Tim Russert died, I got an email from Dumbest Man in America, and he spelled D-I-E-I-N-G.  That would be No Filter, Paul?  No.  To my right.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  About Tim Russert dying.  D-I-E-I-N-G.  I hear him laughing way down the hall.  Of course.  Anytime E-Rock takes some abuse.  Let's go to Atlanta.  It's been a while. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, wait.  Here's the bread.  We think picnics, and I see a large mouth.  Oh, this is real S-kicking.  Thinking that you're gonna change me in some ways, but maybe you might.  Scrug me down, dress me up all, but no matter what.  Remember, I'm still a guy.  I'd like to put thumbtacks in between my knuckles and punch your eyeballs. 
[01:08:00]  You don't like this?  No, I like it.  It's just to do that.  Oh.  See, he's just a guy.  You think they're riding the wild bull sounds crazy, and I'd like to give it a whirl.  Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of, and in a weak moment I might.  Walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall, but remember, I'm still a guy. 
[01:08:30]  It's very catchy.  It's very catchy.  It's catchy.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know.  It is.  Not everything has to be.  That guy's huge.  That guy's huge.  Da, da, da, da, da.  That guy's huge in the country world.  Oh, yeah, he is.  Huge.  And so is Dierks Bentley.  We have to be Dierks.  Dierks Bentley.  Wait, what's this guy's name?  Who'd you sign that?  Brad Paisley.  Brad Paisley.  He also has these hits?  Yeah, those are pretty funny.  He's got a song called So Much Cooler Online and Check You for Ticks. 
[01:09:00]  He's kind of, you know, got a little humor.  Oh, it's no ticks.  Check you for ticks.  Not like.  By the way, going, yeah, going on, just going off the playing field here, but one of our interns  called in sick because of, yeah, what the hell happened?  Because he saw a naked girl yesterday.  What was that about?  Can we get him on the phone?  Which one of our interns?  We had Lisa Sparks in with three X's. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  And we decided to have her do something for Cream Pie Jones, one of our interns.  He's the star of the Blank Hat videos.  You're a fan of the Blank Hat videos.  He was the star of those.  And so it was his birthday, so we decided to have, you know, Lisa Sparks do a little  something, something.  He got so freaked out, he started puking.  And what happened to the guy?  I heard he started sweating and shaking and shaking, hyperventilating, he puked, and now 
[01:10:00]  he called out sick today, right?  Is that true, Sam?  Were you calling clear for work?  I'm just hearing things about this.  I did not see this.  Yeah, well, he, right after he left the studio, he ran to the bathroom and was puking, and  he kind of wobbled out after everything was done and just sat in the office until the end  of the show.  Then, since it was his birthday, him and the other interns went to celebrate at Hooters  after the show.  And him and hip-hop Ron came back because, uh, you remember Than? 
[01:10:30]  He used to work here?  Who?  Than?  It's this guy, Than.  We do a podcast together.  And we were, uh, we were taping it.  What kind of name is Than?  I know, it's weird.  What a weird name.  That sounds like a...  Than.  We were, uh, we were taping a podcast.  Yeah, so him and Ron come back, and Jared has apparently had three and a half beers, which  were two and a half too many, I think.  Ah.  Mm-hmm.  Because, uh, we got him in the studio and we're recording with him for Saturday night,  and he was, he was a little shaky.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  He's a fat-headed lightweight.  What happened to him?  He, you know, he had a porn star in front of him, and she was willing to, you know, do  just about anything.  Yeah.  And he refused, and then had a nervous breakdown.  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.  Pretty much, that's the chain of events.  Well, we got Cream Pie Jones, he's on hold.  We'll, uh...  Cream Pie Jones.  Also known as Jared.  That is one of the best nicknames that no one knows why it's called that ever, that  we can't even really...  Well, we can go into it. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, we'll get into why he's called Cream Pie Jones.  Cream Pie Jones.  Well, he's on hold.  Who gave him that, Danny?  Yeah, I think me and Danny thought of it.  Ah, it's brilliant.  He's on hold, and yes, he had some kind of nervous breakdown, because he,  he saw this, uh, Lisa Sparks in front of him.  Uh, really fast.  Brad in Atlanta.  He's been holding a while.  Brad, what's up?  How's it going, boys?  Morning.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Brad.  Just put your hand on the register.  Brad!  I was just calling in, Opie, because I totally agree with you, Matt.  Every time I see a Norman Rockwell painting, I get this freaked out idea that I'm looking 
[01:12:00]  at a pedophile's work.  Anyway, punch it out.  Yeah, maybe he was a pedo.  He did like painting the tots.  It was just a bit of Americana.  Iraq, find me, uh, some more Norman Rockwell's, uh, for after the break.  I'm telling you, every painting has some kind of pedo angle to it.  Well, you think the one in the doctor's office, where he's giving them the old prostate exam,  is a...  The kid's cute.  The kid's cute.  He captured very cute expressions.  Yeah, look.  Look at this one by Norman Rockwell.  It looks like an innocent little painting. 
[01:12:30]  Four, four boys in their gym shorts getting ready to play basketball.  But look at the shorts.  They're a little too high.  That's how it was back in those days.  Look how he has the one kid bent over a little too far.  The cracker's a little much in the middle.  It's like a James Evans Jr. painting.  I think Norman Rockwell got away with murder.  I really do, man.  They're all discussing what they're going to do.  Number 23 is Paul.  If there were computers back then, I think Norman Rockwell would have some explaining to them.  That's true.  They had to rate his hard drive.  Oh, yeah.  Find out that he's been trading paintings with Jeffrey Jones and Pee Wee Herman. 
[01:13:00]  All his paintings have white splotches on them.  Jimmy, you've got to come up with a song you're digging these days.  They won't have it.  Even if it's an old school.  Even if it's something old that you're just discovering.  What was the song you mentioned the other day?  I had Aunt and I laughing our asses off because you said,  Oh, this song I've been listening to and it was some...  Oh, it's great.  Tom Petty.  Oh, yeah.  Running Down a Dream.  Yeah, this new hit song.  I didn't know it was new, but I didn't know it was that old. 
[01:13:30]  It was good.  Don't vote for Reagan.  He's going to get us in a war.  They won't have it.  I want 1916 by Motorhead.  They won't have it.  Garanty is not until then.  So instead, I'll say Melanie, a brand new pair of roller skates.  Wow.  Brand new key.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  Wow.  I don't know who's Gary.  Me for suggesting it.  I don't know you for correcting me.  Very, very good.  All right.  We're going to get into some other things happening in the world.  I want to say good morning to Boston.  They're doing their parade today for the Celtics. 
[01:14:00]  I think that's at 11 this morning.  So a lot of people calling in sick today.  Shouldn't be too many drunken Irish fighting.  No.  Should be nice.  We talk to Cream Pie Jones next.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got Cream Pie Jones on hold.  Really fast off the instant feedback.  Greg C. from Atlanta. 
[01:14:30]  Norman Rockwell speaking here.  Mm-hmm.  And now let's paint a portrait of the day we spilled the paint.  The day we spilled the paint.  What a creep.  A lot of people say he's Americana.  I'm thinking pedophile.  Pedo.  I'm thinking this Norman Rockwell might have had some hobbies.  More of a pederast.  Well, Stump Rain just found another Norman Rockwell painting.  What is it entitled for the people at home? 
[01:15:00]  It's basically like an old sailor.  Yeah.  And he's got a little sailor boy.  Hey.  It's called Ship Ahoy.  Ship Ahoy.  Ship Ahoy.  Yeah.  I'm a little stunned because I was a Rockwell fan until you started putting all this together.  Oh, boy.  Well, the one we saw with the four kids getting ready to play a game of basketball, their shorts  were a little too high.  Yeah.  And he has two of the kids bent over without them bending their knees.  Yeah.  That's a creepy pose.  It certainly is.  And now there's Ship Ahoy painting. 
[01:15:30]  The old sailor dude is showing the young sailor boy how to use one of those telescopes.  Kind of like a telescope.  You know, you look at the water to see when the whale ships are coming in.  Oh.  But look at his hand.  It's on the boy's back.  He's like, I'm looking at pornography in that.  He's hooked up with that.  It's aimed at the men's changing station.  And he's showing the lad in the sailor outfit the men's changing station through the window. 
[01:16:00]  And notice what happens down there as a man gets older.  What happens, Cap'n?  Cap'n?  I don't know.  I don't think you can do a painting like this in this day and age.  The man's sitting in front of an old wheel.  Like an old ship's wheel.  Yeah.  Ship's wheel.  Arr.  It's very oceanic.  Oceanic.  Oceanic.  Oh my god.  And how convenient.  He's got a peg leg.  You know what that peg is used for. 
[01:16:30]  That's handy.  That's right.  Little attachments on there.  In case the boy runs away, he just jabs him.  Get back here.  Yeah.  What is that one called?  Another Norman Rockwell.  He's a creep.  Now we're looking at one of a little girl with a black eye.  What's that about?  No, a black eye.  Yeah.  See, you wouldn't have painted it.  I thought you said something else.  No, that would have been Disappointed Parade.  She's been in a fight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you can see...  Oh, it's called The Winner, I think.  It's called She Got Lippy. 
[01:17:00]  It's called The Winner.  The Winner, huh?  Yes.  A-Rock, you're saying Little Girl with a Black Eye.  It's called The Winner.  Okay.  You don't believe me?  It's not what it's labeled.  I don't care what it's labeled.  That's a description of it.  The title of the painting, I-Rock.  I-Rock?  Any time?  Just think what you've never been considered.  Why did he just stop the radio show? 
[01:17:30]  I-Rock.  Completely.  What's the matter, I-Rock?  I'm just trying to tell you the name of the painting, but you're like saying, no, it's  this.  I'm going, no.  This is our...  What's it called, somebody?  We're in the middle of our great Norman Rockwell bit.  It is called The Girl with the Black Eye.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  1953.  Okay.  1953.  All right, why don't we talk to Cream Pie Jones?  Yeah.  I like that.  Let's get to this.  All right, so Cream Pie Jones, he's an old intern.  I guess he's home from college for the summer, so he's hanging around the joint.  You might remember him as the guy that wore the duty hat. 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  We like to call him the blank hat video series.  Right.  He was the star of the blank hat video series.  We got tens of views on those videos, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  For some reason, they didn't really take off.  There weren't a lot of people out there that wanted to see the blank hat videos.  No.  That we decided to do, and one wasn't good enough.  We needed to do a whole series of them.  Well, he was the star of those, and it was his birthday yesterday. 
[01:18:30]  We had Lisa Sparks with three X's, porn star.  She stopped by just to say hi.  We didn't even have her booked on the show, and we decided to do the right thing for Cream  Pie Jones and have her do a little something-something for his birthday.  Right.  And she was willing to do just about anything.  And next thing we know, he freaks out, he leaves the chair, and then he pretty much  had a nervous breakdown after the show.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, Cream Pie Jones. 
[01:19:00]  Who's taking the day off, I take it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jared.  Hi.  What's up?  So what happened yesterday?  People want to know.  I don't know.  It was a lot of nerves, and then I felt really bad that I couldn't help out the show anymore.  And then, like, I just felt, like, throwing up.  Did you have, like, an anxiety attack, or?  I don't think it was an anxiety attack.  Like, I had been sick, like, the week before.  I'd been really congested, and I hadn't been feeling well. 
[01:19:30]  And I don't know.  It just.  What were you stricken with?  Vagina-itis?  No.  You were stricken with cooties.  How old are you?  It's a girl.  She was naked.  She's got some really large feeders.  And she had her hands all over you.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That whole, you know.  Girl thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  The 19 gangbang sort of thing. 
[01:20:00]  I know.  All right.  What are you talking about?  Oh, the fact that Lisa has the record for the most guys in one of those scenes, which  is, like, 900 and something.  Yeah, yeah.  You know the video series where a girl takes on a bunch of guys to try to set a record.  And the girl that had the most guys wins.  Well, she, I guess, holds the record.  And the number is 800, was it?  Nine-something.  What is she?  Nine-something.  Sorry.  900 and something. 
[01:20:30]  And I guess that got Cream Pie a little nervous.  Is that true there, Cream Pie?  Yeah.  Why would that make you nervous?  You weren't going to, like...  Yeah, you're not taking her home to mom.  And you weren't going to have sex with her.  And you weren't following all of them.  It wasn't like they just got, you know, finished.  Right.  And you were on cleanup duty.  Do girls make you nervous?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I think it was just being in a room full of other men and having to, you know... 
[01:21:00]  And having those feelings.  And having her...  And having those feelings.  Having her hands on you, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that was getting you nervous, so you're hyperventilated?  Oh, Opie wanted me to do something I can't say on air.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  And...  That covers a lot of ground.  Was it you doing something to her or her doing something to you?  Her doing something to me.  Oh, okay.  Then I completely understand. 
[01:21:30]  So now this wouldn't entail you working at all, right?  All you would have had to do is sit there.  Yeah, but like...  I couldn't, you know...  Your fear would have been visibly obvious to every man in the room.  Right, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not really.  Your fear.  Not really, because what we wanted to happen, he could have kept his pants on.  We wanted something to happen...  Of course.  ...in his drawers.  Yeah, that wasn't happening yesterday. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, but...  All right, so we understand all that, but why the...  Yeah, the nervous breakdown.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like, I felt like...  I guess I felt really bad that, like, I couldn't give the show the big finish.  Oh, so you're saying you got all nervous and that because you'd let the show down?  Yeah, pretty much.  Liar.  He just kept repeating, I'm not used to failing the show.  I'm not used to failing the show.  You should be.  That's what everybody told him.  You're a huge failure.  Exactly. 
[01:22:30]  You're a failure of epic proportions.  Yeah, you used to be like our stunt boy until Pat Duffy came along.  People forgot all about you, cream pie.  Cream pie?  Cream pie Jones is a distant memory at this point.  And they do call him cream pie Jones because...  Why?  Cream pie refuses to use male birth control.  Why?  He refuses to use male birth control.  He hates it.  And disease protection.  I didn't know where that came from.  So...  They just came up with the name cream pie Jones. 
[01:23:00]  Wow.  Well, he refuses to use it or he refuses to make other guys use it.  You want to be bread, do you?  That is weird, man.  But you...  Is it true you were thrown up after your time with the porn star?  Yeah, I threw up once.  That is nuts.  That's not good for the reputation there.  Yeah, I know.  It was, you know, just a weird day.  How are you going to redeem yourself? 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  And then you had a call in sick today?  Why?  I just...  I came home later that day and I just...  I wasn't really feeling well.  I threw up again.  Yeah, but you were drunk.  You had to drink it off?  Yeah.  And then, um...  I just wasn't feeling well the rest of the day.  My stomach was hurting me and I had chills.  Chills.  Stomach hurting, chills.  Throwing up from a girl.  From the douche variety. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  He started freaking out after the show because Thin, apparently, he might have hooked up  with some chick right after the animation fest.  And I guess this was supposed to be a secret, but Thin knew about it.  So we started asking him about it and he started freaking out and putting his head on the desk  and acting like his world was ending right in front of him.  Why?  Who did he hook up with?  Might have been a member of message boards.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which one?  Uh, her name is a day of the week. 
[01:24:30]  Uh, the last day of a work week.  He just hung up.  Cream pie.  Oh, wow.  Cream pie Jones just hung up.  Oh, cream pie.  Oh, wow.  Is she California or New York?  I don't know a lot about her.  It's not Saturday or Sunday.  Oh, I know.  Okay.  No.  Or Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.  Definitely not.  All right.  What did he say they did, Sam?  He wouldn't get into detail, but first he said they just talked, and then we said, why 
[01:25:00]  did you just talk?  It seemed like it was going to happen, and then he said, we didn't just talk, and then  he wouldn't.  Hubba hubba.  Yeah.  Do you have a picture of her?  Well, I think I'm pal talk right now.  Marissa's trying to pull up a picture.  Okay.  So cream pie Jones, there you go.  He's scared of porn stars or women in general.  We don't know.  We're trying to figure it out, but with this info that Sam just gave us, now we're really  confused. 
[01:25:30]  This cream pie Jones, he's a weirdo, man.  Yeah, he really is strange.  He's a strange bird.  He is strange.  Let's say good morning to Louie CK.  Louie!  Good morning.  Good morning, fellows.  Hi, Lou.  Weren't you supposed to be here a couple days ago?  Wow.  She's hot.  Wait, hold on.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  That was Marissa's page.  Damn it.  I was supposed to be there, but my airplane would not take off.  What happened to your airplane?  I got stuck in Nashville.  What were you flying?  Were you flying in Nashville?  Well, he was doing Bonnaroo, right? 
[01:26:00]  I was doing Bonnaroo with Jimmy.  He was very smart that he left at like five o'clock in the morning.  I left at like three in the afternoon, at which time the thunderstorms had gathered and  I couldn't get out.  Oh, were they down there too?  Because they happened in Newark as well.  Well, they kind of go up their east coast, you know, so they were there.  At one point, they said they were over the middle of the, between, and then they said  they were over New York and, you know.  Okay.  So I couldn't get out of there.  It was a nightmare.  What'd you do, man?  I just went to a hotel in Nashville and just sat in a hotel room in a strange city with 
[01:26:30]  no reason to be there.  It was annoying, right?  It's like depressing.  There's something wrong.  Oh, it's really depressing.  It's a very like, wow, I'm like two steps from suicide right now.  But isn't it weird how we overreact?  It's like, all right, bad weather kept you an extra day.  I mean, it's not like a big deal.  It's like, yeah, it couldn't be avoided.  I hate that.  When I want to go, I want to go.  Yeah, of course.  No, I hate it.  And also, I made a call because they put me on a flight that was supposed to leave at 
[01:27:00]  like 10 p.m.  And then they said, but it might not leave.  And I made this big, healthy, self-taking care of, you know what?  I'm going to get a really nice hotel room and just forget it.  I'm not going to, because I know I'm going to sit here and the flight's never going to  take off.  But of course, I, you know, then I, I, I checked the flight status because I want to know what  an idiot I am.  And it took off exactly on time.  Well, yeah, but who knew though?  I mean, if it didn't take off, you at what time did you get to your hotel?  Yeah, but it didn't, it doesn't matter. 
[01:27:30]  The reality is it did take off.  That's true.  No, you can't, you can't decide you did something right because of something that might've happened.  But you know what though?  If you can't kill yourself either, if like the odds are completely against it and you  take the safe option of getting a room and not sitting in an airport for six more hours.  I mean, I probably would have done the same thing and I'm a good traveler.  I was, I won best traveler in town three years ago.  Oh.  Yes.  In town?  In town.  Best traveler in town.  All the townspeople vote here in Manhattan and they voted me best traveler three years  in a row.  Yeah, but you're, you're traveling means you're leaving town. 
[01:28:00]  Why do they?  Oh, they just talk when I'm gone.  Eat an apple.  Sorry, I'm here with the kids and cutting apples for them.  Aw.  So where are you now?  Cutting apples.  Such a good dad.  I'm at home.  Well, that is it.  Boy, if that's, if that's all it takes, cutting an apple.  Yeah.  Um, I'm in, in New York at home with the two children.  So couldn't you just come by and do the radio show with us?  Well, I, I have the kids. 
[01:28:30]  I could have to bring the kids.  That would be fun.  Bring the kids.  Anthony now loves kids.  They could watch Lisa Sparks and the, and the intern.  Yeah.  Well, that does.  Today it's Lisa Sparks and Pat from Munaki.  Pat from Munaki.  And Pat's not going to be throwing up.  Pat's going to be, he's going to get right in there like a man should.  Yeah.  No, I think my six year old would really enjoy the cherry darts.  Yeah.  Well, you know, we could have a, the six year old throw a few. 
[01:29:00]  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  The thing is sad is that if, if you could get past the, what that's actually, actually probably  would enjoy it.  Yeah.  So did you, you enjoy yourself in, in Bonnaroole?  Yeah.  I had a good, I mean, you know, I'm, I don't belong there.  I'm 40 and, uh, there's all these girls with like, you know, just stomachs.  There's just these stomachs everywhere.  And like, you know, cut off shorts and, uh, bikini tops, but I'm invisible to them. 
[01:29:30]  I'm literally invisible.  Like I could have taken all their wallets.  They wouldn't have.  So, um, did you, how great was it?  Actually, I watched Metallica with Louie.  We, uh, we got to see them together.  How great were they?  Oh, Metallica, that was the best live show I've ever seen.  I mean, it was really phenomenal.  They, they, they, they really put on a show.  They're fans.  And there was this really weird part where, um, well, uh, you know, before the show I was  backstage and Lars told me that, um, the drummer, he said that, uh, he really liked my last special 
[01:30:00]  shameless and he particularly liked the part about the, uh, well, which I'm on a, I'm not  on XM.  Let's just say it's a sexual activity.  Um, it was a sexual activity with his wife involving.  Yeah.  That involves, involves the hand.  Yes.  And so, uh, in the middle of, I'm, so I'm, during the show, I'm up on the rafters looking  down at Metallica, uh, entertaining an audience of 80,000 people, about 15, 15 mosh pits.  It's larger than life. 
[01:30:30]  And I looked down at Lars, the drummer, and he looks back and he sees me and he does a  hand motion related to that.  Oh, no kidding.  Wow.  That's awesome.  What happens is Lars has a little setup behind the drum set where he'll go and change his  shirt and he has like a minute to relax during a guitar solo or something like that, but  he stays on the stage.  And, uh, he looked up at Louie cause Steve, his assistant was pointed up at Louie and Lars  smiled and did the hand motion.  I wanted to throw Louie off the balcony.  Oh, right in the middle of playing.  No, it was like, it's like you're looking at a $5 bill and Lincoln like winks and does 
[01:31:00]  a little funny, uh, like a little sexual thing.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it was great.  Well, Louie, you got to come in and say hi to us, man.  Oh, I'm going, I'm dying to go.  I've, I really miss being on the show and I, I've listened all the time and I just mad  that I'm not there.  Did he hear us talk to Ricky Gervais?  I know I, I was, uh, not, no, I was not awake.  Uh, Ricky was giving you props, man. 
[01:31:30]  No, Ricky was great.  Ricky was really fun.  And he was talking about, um, I forgot a video of you and him on a plane.  Yeah, we were on his, uh, private jet, uh, that they, the company that financed his movie  gave him the jet for like the whole time he was making the movie.  So he gave me a ride to New York and, uh, we hit some really awful, I'm pretty good at  flying, but this turbulence was really awful and it's a tiny plane.  So you just feel like you're just going to die.  And it just, just things started coming out of my mouth out of the fear, like the fear 
[01:32:00]  just started pushing strange things out of my mouth.  Anyway, so he made a video of it and it's on his website.  I hear it's really funny.  I haven't checked it out yet.  Can we link it on ONA radio?  Yeah, I want to see that.  All right, we'll do that.  I think it's pretty clean.  It's not, uh, cause, cause he, he doesn't like his website to be terribly dirty.  Right.  I think, I think I, I just started saying at one point I said babies with AIDS.  It just came out of my mouth.  Babies with AIDS.  Well, you'll say crazy stuff.  You were getting tossed around pretty good, huh?  Yeah.  Cause when you're about to, you think you're, I mean, it's not that I didn't believe I was 
[01:32:30]  going to die.  It's just that my body's being shaken, you know, like, like God holding me and just shaking  me like a pair of dice.  Um, although he doesn't exist.  So there's only one of you as opposed to two in dice.  Yeah, that's true.  Being shaken like a single Lou.  Yeah.  Like a single die.  Yeah, exactly.  I've been watching the office again lately.  I just keep, uh, throwing it on my, I got a big Mac, uh, screen, a 30 inch screen.  I just keep putting it on while I'm writing.  It's just amazing. 
[01:33:00]  You're talking about the English office, right?  That's the only one there is.  Right.  Yeah.  No, the American one is dog poopy.  I hate it.  There's an American one?  There's an American one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't know.  Louie, we got to take a break.  We're really late, but, uh, you're at Caroline's starting tonight?  I'm at Caroline's, uh, tonight through Sunday.  Oh, really?  All right.  2-2-7-5-7-4-1-hundred.  The great Louie CK, of course.  And come see you soon, Louie.  I'm going to come in next week, I hope, guys.  I think I am.  That, that sounds great.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right, Louie. 
[01:33:30]  Sorry about this week.  Uh, no worries.  Louie CK, everyone.  Hanging with his kids.  And, uh, Otto's here.  Somewhere in New York.  Yeah, Otto from Otto and George joining the program next.  Uh, as we go to break, because they beg for it, um, Anthelini updates.  Oh.  It's a, it's a bit Sam's doing.  We're trying to come up with a name for this thing.  We don't know if we should call it the morning buzz with Sam, or the morning sickness with  Sam, but, uh, Sam's on to something.  And here's the latest update.  Another day, another update, as the news on Anthelini keeps coming in. 
[01:34:00]  When we last left the king and queen of Long Island rubbish, Jill wouldn't even acknowledge  Anthony on television.  After hearing our report, Jill went on the air and said this.  Is that your new boyfriend, I see?  I don't mean to call you out on that, but that, that is him, right?  Anthony?  I think everyone knows.  That's Anthony Cuglia, yeah, from Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, George, for coming down, darling.  Sound forced much?  Sources are telling us that Jill was none too happy with her coworkers for, quote, throwing  her under the bus, and was so embarrassed, she burst into tears after the segment aired. 
[01:34:30]  At this rate, Anthelini could go back to being two separate names before the week's end.  Speaking of moving on, sources are saying that E-Rot, the sex bagel nagel,  may be looking for new employment soon.  He was once again berated by Opie for a lackluster performance on the job recently,  and this one may have finally pushed the boss too far.  What?  E-Rot, will you get back to your post?  E-Rot abandons his post a lot.  All the time.  Stop socializing. 
[01:35:00]  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Our reporters are telling us that E-Rot drowned his sorrows in ham sandwiches and glasses of  mayonnaise as he attempted to forget the way his hero slash father figure scolded him.  We hope for his sake those sandwiches will be covered by unemployment.  Stay tuned as we bring you all of the Opie and Anthony show gossip that has North America  glued to their radio.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got Otto from Otto and George in studio, but before that, Anthony? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah?  Got a treat for you.  What do you got?  We were talking music earlier.  You admitted that one of your favorite songs out right now is a Brad Paisley number.  I didn't say one of my favorites.  I said I kind of liked the song.  You know.  It's getting your attention, right?  Yeah.  It was, you know, catchy.  Kind of had a little humor to it.  And what's the name of the song again?  I'm Just a Guy or something like that?  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  We got Club Sutter Kenny singing it for you.  Oh, wow.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony's top song of the day.  Brad Paisley.  I'm still a guy.  When you see a deer, you see Bambi.  And I see antlers up on the wall.  When you see a lake, you think picnics.  And I see a large mouth up on that log.  You're probably thinking that you're gonna change me. 
[01:36:30]  In some ways, well, maybe you might.  Scrub me down.  Dress me up.  Oh, but no matter what.  Remember, I'm still a guy.  Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Just for you, Anthony.  Just for you.  Thanks.  What's up, Botto?  All that talent and looks, too.  I know. 
[01:37:00]  Club Sutter Kenny.  Kenny's the best.  What I love about Kenny, he sells it, man.  Oh, God.  He tries to sell it no matter what.  Yeah, well, he's no Anthony's mother, though, in the vocal department.  Oh, you heard that?  No.  I heard that.  Janis Joplin, huh?  Oh, God.  I've heard better sounds than a pay toilet.  It's Janis Joplin from the grave.  Oh, God.  That mustache, man.  I don't know.  You look like a villain from the Wild Bunch.  You should be chasing William Holden or something.  Very villainous. 
[01:37:30]  That's cool, though.  I was going for the, you know, what's his name from the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly there?  Lee Van Cleef.  Oh, yeah?  I'm going for the Lee Van Cleef.  Nobody has just a mustache anymore.  It's always the goatee or nothing.  Yeah, if it's just a mustache, it's too 70s porno.  Yeah.  It's just creepy without the little soul patch.  It needs something underneath, a little stubble.  Sure.  And whatever.  It's cool.  It's, I think, I like the new look.  I was going for a, you know, maybe a D'Artagnan. 
[01:38:00]  Really?  You know.  Changing the look up?  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  You know.  You got to switch things around.  Yeah.  Once you get, if you're in a relationship for a while and then you get out of one, that's  when you got to kind of, you know, make some changes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you shave off a little of this, you do a little of that.  Really?  Yeah.  You know, you got to change things up.  Change the house around a little bit.  Okay.  Yeah.  Move the bed, stuff like that.  Yeah, things like that.  So it takes away that familiarity.  Is your relationship going really good or is she turning to a colossal bitch or anything? 
[01:38:30]  Well, no, that relationship, the one I was in for like eight years is over.  Yeah, I know that.  Yeah.  You're dating that newsletter.  Yes.  It's only been a month.  It's wonderful.  Anything but terrific.  Yeah.  Yes.  There she is on TV right now.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm kidding.  It's like a 10-year-old girl on the screen.  Oh, God.  I don't know what to say.  All right.  You got caught with that one. 
[01:39:00]  Speaking of your house, a lot of people want to know what's going on with the pool.  Well, tomorrow's D-Day.  If I don't see some progress with the pool today, they're going to get one of the worst  commercials they've ever, ever dreamt in their wildest hallucination.  But they're dawdling on you?  They're dawdling.  And you gave them the money?  And you gave them the money?  Dawdling.  Oh, God.  I hand it over too much money, I think.  Yeah, that's it.  If you give it all at once, then they can, yeah, stiff you.  Then they can dawdle.  Italians love cement, right?  Oh, we love concrete.  You love it, right?  Cement sackcrete. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  And when that truck pulls up and the big thing starts turning and the cement comes out.  Oh, God.  Oh, for Italians, that's amazing.  Oh, yeah.  We're still amazed by the cement mixer.  I know.  It's like a sauce.  Oh, yeah.  It's like gravy.  It's like gravy.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, right.  Two parts sand, one part cement.  I'm a big fan of the recipe.  I'm a big fan of the people that like to cement their front yard.  That's just terrific.  A lot of Italians do that in some of the neighborhoods.  They just pave over the front lawn with concrete and then paint it green. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And then they try to cut it with lawnmowers, those idiots.  Yeah.  And the pebbles are shooting all of them.  Let's get inside and have some galima.  That accent was right up there with your regular Joe routine and the bad black guy you do.  I have very good voices.  Your character's state.  I do these impressions.  You think it was the real people.  Yeah, Jimmy's a master of the voices.  Oh, tell us how you really feel, Otto.  Wow, regular guy.  He's going to be off, off, off Broadway with his one-man show. 
[01:40:30]  He's so far off Broadway, he's going to be on the runway at Newark Airport.  It's a one-man blow.  Oh, you mentioned Wings Houser before.  Oh, what a great actor.  What a vicious movie that was.  Right?  Yeah.  I think Otto turned us on to that movie.  I think you were the one that came in and was talking about Vice or whatever it's called.  No, I saw that before.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a vicious pimp.  But I was telling Kenny over there about who Wings Houser is.  He was the guy in JoJo Dancer who was like the throw-the-coke party for Richard Pryor. 
[01:41:00]  What is he?  Oh, really?  Has he done anything else?  He's banging his wife.  No.  I don't know where Wings.  He's like a cheap version of Rutger Hauer, right?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ginger, I just want to love you.  You ain't going to hit me, Ramrod?  Yeah.  Ramrod.  Yeah, that was his name.  He was great.  He was so great.  Did you ever see Morgan Freeman in a movie called Street Smart?  No.  He plays a vicious pimp in that.  And he's got these long nails.  And all he does is drink bottles of Yoo-Hoo and smash it into women's faces the whole movie. 
[01:41:30]  It's great.  That sounds great.  It's unbelievable.  He's got these creepy long nails, and he finishes the Yoo-Hoo and smashes it on a girl's head.  You would love it.  Wow.  It's really funny.  It's very good.  All right.  Who was that Wings Hauser movie?  Who was the good guy in it that was hunting him down?  Well, it was Season Hubbly.  He was a prostitute.  Yeah.  And I forget the other guy's name.  It had to be a cop.  That was, you know.  Yeah, bad Paul Newman.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  It wasn't a name or anything.  Wings Hauser was the biggest name in that movie.  Wings Hauser.  Wings Hauser was in a lot of stuff, though.  Yeah.  It was like a 10-minute period back in the 80s.  Yeah, he was.  Yeah.  He's like in those cheap Charles Bronson movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know who was in it, too?  It was Fred Berry.  Rerun from What's Happening.  No way.  He was.  He plays a pimp in a silk robe, and he goes in there.  Wings Hauser's looking for this girl who ratted him out.  So his name is Dorsey, and he grabs him on the neck, and he throws him against the wall.  And he's hurting him. 
[01:42:30]  He has a switchblade, and he's got it at his silk boxers.  Oh, he's poking him in the silk boxers.  Yeah, with the switchblade.  Vicious.  Wings.  He's like, you know what the problem with you sugar pimps is?  And he goes, you ain't got no blank, boy.  Yeah, yeah.  And he stabs him, and you're like, oh!  I remember somebody getting run over by a car, like, repeatedly, like, driven into a wall.  Isn't that how Wings dies?  That might be how Wings dies.  Wings gets it.  The overacting cop lead. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  I can't remember.  Another really good one is The Saint of Fort Washington.  What's his name?  Ving Rhames plays a vicious thug who preys on people at this homeless shelter.  He's very scary in that movie.  Yeah.  It's not like movie, like a villain.  It's like he's just, it just seems real.  It's terrifying.  What's it called?  The Saint of Fort Washington.  Matt Dillon and the black guy from Lethal Weapon.  Danny Glover.  Danny Glover.  What year? 
[01:43:30]  I'd say mid-90s, maybe.  Oh.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Okay.  It's about squeegee people and what they do when they're not squeegeeing cars off.  Oh.  Yeah.  Probably investment banking.  Sculpting Hummels.  Yeah.  I do believe Otto's not a fan of the blockbuster.  You know a lot of obscure movies, man.  Blockbuster, you mean rent?  Blockbuster movies, like, you know, like, it doesn't sound like you would go out and see,  like, the Hulk or anything like that.  Well, yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing Get Smart right after I get my leukemia 
[01:44:00]  mailed over.  I don't know, man.  Get Smart.  Yeah, that just looks like a bomb.  I mean, Alan Arkinson, I'm glad he's getting paid.  He's a terrific actor, but I don't know.  Just leave it alone.  Yeah, why can't they just let those shows sit?  I mean, after The Honeymooners was made into a movie, I thought the world should have just  come to an end at that point.  Yeah.  Especially if it was better than the original.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Hysterical.  Hey, how about the remake?  Steve Martin should be shot for touching the Pink Panther.  I've been screaming about that for two years.  Yeah, I mean, that's really wrong.  I mean, I think we talked about this already.  It's like, you need Blake Edwards and you need Henry Mancini and you need the great Peter  Sellers, you know?  Yeah.  There's no movie there.  He is so bad.  Yeah.  With his bad, stupid accent that just sounds like the wild and crazy guy.  He's really stunk.  I know.  He sounds like your friend doing a bad accent at a party to get laughs.  Yeah.  He's making everyone uncomfortable because he's not funny. 
[01:45:00]  He's making a new one, too.  Of course he is.  Yeah.  He is.  What an old creep with a bad rug.  Yeah.  I mean, he hasn't done anything funny in years.  Not at all.  Nothing.  It's a little white toilet sheet cover on his head.  I hated the Parenthood movies.  Hated them.  Oh, yeah.  What was the last good movie he made, do you think?  Planes and Trains and Automobiles.  That's right.  One of our favorites.  And The Lonely Guy was pretty good.  But John Candy made that movie great.  He was great enough to play straight man to John Candy.  He knew just get out of the guy's way and let him steal the movie. 
[01:45:30]  You know?  It was great.  Love that.  But he was still annoying.  Yeah.  He was so serious writing.  That smug face.  Yeah.  To create a cheaper by the dozens.  Yeah.  He's just awful.  Bringing down the house.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Relevant old white guy.  He's so awful.  Nothing worse.  Again, we brought this up before then.  When you walk into a blockbuster and you have to look at the video covers.  Oh.  And the pictures they take for the cover.  Yeah.  And he's all just, oh, he's having fun.  I always look at those and go, oh, look at the father.  And he's in a horrible situation. 
[01:46:00]  All those kids.  And the wife is looking at him like, oh, honey, you can handle it.  Like, Bill Murray's the only guy.  Oh, I hate those.  Bill Murray's the only guy who still does good stuff from that era that I still think is  talented and relevant and isn't just a bloated, fat, old, rich guy, you know?  Well, the great Chevy Chase.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't know.  Sheesh.  Hey, let's say hi to Steven Mastic.  He's got an update on your pool, eh?  Mastic.  Steve, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Steve.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, kid.  Listen, Anthony, my buddy calls me up and says, I've got Anthony's pool to do. 
[01:46:30]  It's scheduled for today and Friday to be wired.  It's Bethel Electric.  Yeah, okay.  I know about the electric.  Yeah.  I need my pool shot.  Why is it not being done sooner?  I want the goddamn coating put on there.  Well, then you've got to complain to them.  Exactly.  I'm not talking.  Did I talk about the electric company, sir?  I know they're coming.  No, I'm just making sure you knew.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:47:00]  You're not the problem.  You're the pool company.  Nick in Wisconsin.  Nick.  Hey, guys.  Martin did two good movies, I want to say, in the past 10 years.  He did this one called Novocaine, which is this dark comedy where he's a dentist framed  for murder.  And he also did this David Mamet movie called The Spanish Prisoner where he was the bad guy.  I didn't see that.  I like my comedians funny.  He plays straight.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  The drama to Al Pacino.  Give me a break.  Oh, The Three Amigos was so funny. 
[01:47:30]  You should get together with my girlfriend.  She liked both of those movies.  Oh, really?  I've got to see the Spanish Prisoner.  I don't.  I don't have to.  You don't like when comedians go serious?  Yeah.  You don't like when they go serious, Otto?  No.  I mean, you know.  What about Robin Williams when he goes serious?  It's like Bridges in Madison County.  Let's do a movie with Clint Eastwood where he doesn't shoot or punch anybody.  I just want to see him hugging Meryl Streep for two hours.  I want to see him punch somebody through a glass window or blow their head off.  Come on.  Yeah.  He's snapping pictures of Bridges and washing by the pump. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  He's his old saggy body.  Yeah.  He spends all afternoon setting up his camera for the shot.  You mind if I put my film in your refrigerator?  Is that a...  Right.  You mean that literally or is that figurative?  We're obsessed with that dumb movie, Otto.  I love and hate that movie.  When he's out by the pump and he's got his shirt off and his skin is hanging like doilies.  Like an elephant's ass?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And Meryl Streep is up by the window watching him. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  And she's gently touching herself.  That's acting.  Really?  Ugh.  With the bad scoliosis.  Oh, yeah.  He's like crooked one way and the...  Yeah.  He was completely.  It was awful to watch.  His poor arthritic torso.  Oh, yeah.  Do we have other examples of actors doing what...  Not doing what they're known for?  What they're supposed to be doing.  Yeah.  The Clint Eastwood is a perfect one.  Who else?  Well, you know, you got James Cagney in a cowboy movie was a big joke at the time. 
[01:49:00]  He had a big 10-gallon hat and Bogart said he looked like a mushroom because he's really  short and a hat that's like tall in him.  What was the name of that?  Oklahoma Kid or something?  Yeah.  I think this movie right here, Edward Norton playing the Hulk is kind of...  What's he doing?  That's kind of a waste of a great actor.  Yeah, he's really good.  Putting a guy like that in a superhero movie, it's like, you know, he's not going to get  much of a chance to act in that, will he? 
[01:49:30]  No.  Yeah.  They put a CGI Hulk in there for the most part.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You watch him in stuff like Fight Club and American History X and it's like...  Yeah, he's an amazing actor.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's say hi to Joe in Chicago.  Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Hello, boys.  Steve Martin hasn't been funny since 1985.  The other remake that he made that totally stunk was as Sergeant Bilko, which wasn't funny.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  That's right.  I dig your candor, man.  Punch it out.  All right, Joe.  Yeah, he's gotten really unwatchable. 
[01:50:00]  He's really terrible.  Yeah.  All he's doing is stealing great roles.  It's like thievery.  Yeah.  It's just comedy.  It's kind of contingent on catching you off guard.  You're stealing.  Yeah.  If somebody walked on stage in a white suit and went, arrow in the head.  Right.  Nobody would go, wow, what a great tribute.  They'd go, he's stealing from Steve Martin.  So what's the difference?  How could you steal from Peter Sellers?  That's just...  But not even do it well.  It's just...  It's an awful...  It just shouldn't be done at all.  Some of these things, like we've said many, many times, should just be left alone.  I'm working on a hysterical song about King Tut. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, by the way, Norman Rockwell was a big alcoholic.  Yeah?  He saw the world through, what do they call it, rose-colored sunglasses.  Yeah, he was a big lush.  Oh, really?  He didn't see people for the way they really were.  Yeah, the bastards that they were, so everyone's sweet and kind and nice.  Bourbon-soaked view of the world and humanity.  There's a pedo angle there, too.  Oh, yeah.  Loves the kids.  Yeah, he loves the kids and putting them in some awkward positions. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Well, most people would say an innocent position.  I don't think so.  I see it another way.  Do you think he favored male children or female children?  He seems to have a lot of boys in those pictures.  Yeah.  Little runaways.  A lot of little boys.  Naughty wayward.  Yeah.  Well, E-Rock brings up Vin Diesel, who destroyed his career with the pacifier.  Didn't he have kind of an action career going for himself?  I guess.  He did.  He was like, you know.  Vin Diesel?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love Pitch Black. 
[01:51:30]  That movie's really cool.  Is that a good movie?  Yeah.  On a planet.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, they find out that, you know, years go by, and then the planet goes  into this eclipse and becomes pitch black, and these creatures come out of the Earth  once every, like, 30 years or so.  This happens, and they happen to crash on this planet when this happened, and they got  to get from where they crashed to this little shuttle ship to take off and get off the planet.  But it's dark.  And these monsters, they're pretty cool looking.  Yeah, and it's dark. 
[01:52:00]  You can see them.  It's not too dark.  No, they give you these nice little bursts of where you can see them.  Yeah, one guy is surrounded.  He's, like, really injured, and they smell the blood, and you can't see anything, and  the guy's just kind of looking around.  So he takes a swig of this booze, and he's got a torch that's barely lit, and he spits  it into it, and for a second it lights up, and he's just surrounded by these things.  Oh, cool.  And then the light goes off, and you just hear, and they eat him.  They tear him to pieces.  That should be the sound that the guy's making your pool should be making right now. 
[01:52:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Finish it.  Yeah.  Let's go to Ray on Long Island.  Ray.  You know how it is.  People that run by the almighty dollar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's regular Joe.  Regular Joe stopping by.  Love regular Joe.  Hey, Ray.  And hate regular Joe.  How are you doing, guys?  Good.  That movie that Sylvester Stallone did when he was supposed to be a country singer?  Rhinestone.  Oh.  Awful.  He also did Oscar.  He tried to do comedy.  Yeah, yeah.  Rhinestone.  Yeah.  That would be the worst movie I've ever seen in the whole world.  Rhinestone made Sergeant Bilko look like Masterpiece Theater. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  How about Stop or My Mom Will Shoot?  Yeah.  They probably all made money, too.  That's so stupid.  Yeah.  Let's go.  I don't know why people put out movies that have titles that you can't picture people saying,  Hey, do you want to go see?  Yeah.  And then say the title.  Like, they're either too long or too awkward to say, You want to go see Stop or My Mom Will Shoot?  Yeah.  Like, no.  I don't.  Yeah.  I don't even want to say it.  Oh, by the way, I was listening when Tom was going to shoot himself last week. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You guys did a great job of, you know, being just compassionate and good guys.  Us guys?  Yeah.  Well, apparently it was just Opie.  Yeah.  That's what the newspaper said.  You know.  I could have used you the other day.  I saw this guy was threatening to jump off a building here in Midtown, and a crowd gathered  on the ground.  Typical New Yorkers.  They yelled up, How big is your apartment?  Two bedrooms, a lot of closet space.  Jump. 
[01:54:00]  I'll be in Atlantic City July 5th.  Where are you going to be?  I'm going to be at the Showboat Casino and Resort at the House of Blues.  Well, aren't you Mr. Fancy Pants?  What's the website, Otto, for your dates?  Oh, OttoandGeorge.com.  Okay.  With that, you mentioned the Tom thing from last week.  One more play for this thing.  Anthony's Suicide Hotline.  Yeah.  Because Anthony had a very unique style through the whole thing.  Yeah.  I have a unique style of talking people down.  When this crisis was going down last week. 
[01:54:30]  Thanks for calling the Anthony Cumia Suicide Hotline, where the prominent radio host will  listen to your cry for help, and with his patented five-step solution, we'll hold your  hand through this troubling time.  Number one.  Get way too excited about the suicide note.  What does your note say?  I don't want pity.  What does your note say?  It says, hey, have a great run.  My time is now.  Have fun.  Number two.  Insult the author after the note is read.  That's it? 
[01:55:00]  That's it.  You need to punch that up a little.  You'll realize it's not about you.  It was never about you.  It was always about Anthony and how he was going to get his hands on your gun.  Number three.  Get too inquisitive about weapons.  What kind of weapon do you have there, Tom?  I have a choice.  A Walter PPK or a Beretta 9mm.  Or an AR-15.  Number four.  After shots are fired, make sure to find out which gun it was. 
[01:55:30]  Whoops.  Hello?  What was that, the .380?  It was another 9mm.  And five.  Ask for the weapons.  Can I have your guns?  One will probably be used as an evidence, but I'll put the other one away.  And I'll will it to you, Anthony.  Fantastic.  So if you're thinking about taking that big plunge, why not will all your guns over to Anthony?  From the Anthony Cumia Suicide Hotline.  Oh, God.  That's morbid. 
[01:56:00]  Hey, this is Otto and George, America's funniest X-rated ventriloquist.  Come to Atlantic City July 5th to the Showboat Casino.  One show only at the House of Blues.  For information, go to HOB.com or call 609-236-2583.  609-236-2583.  And visit OttoandGeorge.com for all my upcoming dates.  One of my faves in studio today. 
[01:56:30]  By the way, Opie and Anthony.  We got Otto and George, one of my favorites.  Jimmy.  No dummy, though.  We like that.  We like when just Otto comes in now.  Yeah, I mean, you can call him a stupid puppet, though.  Yeah, but that's endearing when I say stupid. 
[01:57:00]  Don't you think there's enough stand-up comics?  Aren't I different and special?  Of course.  Come on, how many crappy stand-up comics do you want to see?  I didn't mean stupid.  I know, I know.  You know I love you.  Yeah.  I go to see you whenever I can.  Now, where are you going to be?  Showboat?  Hotel and Casino?  Yeah.  Montreal Comedy Festival.  I'm going to be on the Conti and Kenny show this coming Monday on, what's that website?  What is it?  Cringe Humor Radio.  Cringe Humor Radio.  All right.  This Monday, 7 to 10 p.m. 
[01:57:30]  But we need to sell tickets for the Atlantic City show, right?  Oh, the big show is July 5th at the House of Blues and at the Showboat Casino.  One show only.  That might be a lot of times those are casino shows or spur of the moment buys, too, because  people are down there.  Yeah.  A lot of casino shows don't sell out in advance.  I used to do Vegas with Dice, and he would have half a house sold.  I know.  They're panicking.  And he was going to sell out.  He would know it was going to sell out because people coming to town.  They were going to yank the date on me.  If I don't get 250 tickets sold, I'm going to get $1,000 less in salary because of my 
[01:58:00]  milquetoast pussy agent.  I need a Luca Brazzi in there, you know, threatening the guy.  Get me more.  Blow your brains all over the contract.  He needs any, I think, not to disrespect your agent, I'm sure he's good.  He couldn't get the Pope booked on Sermonette.  What does he do?  If he was your agent, you wouldn't be working.  You know, we'd like Otto to do the show.  He wants $5,000. 
[01:58:30]  We'll give him $200.  All right.  Yeah.  I know.  You got to compromise.  Yeah.  He's always, like, coming back to me and going, oh, no, it's a standard deal.  That's what they're paying.  I go, yeah, but they requested me.  When they call me specifically, we can hold them up for whatever we want.  You know, it's like, just say no to everything.  Would you ever leave your agent?  Um, yeah, of course.  In a second.  In a second.  Yeah.  Do you know, uh, you bummed me out with that comedian we know, Frank D'Amico died.  I did a lot of guys out there knew Frank. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, Frank D'Amico.  I hadn't seen him in years.  He moved to LA.  He was a big, fat comic.  He was funny, though.  Yeah, great guy.  He used to snort coke and have BLTs at the same time.  Oh, God.  And then drink gigantic woo-woos, you know, vodka and cranberry.  Yeah, real healthy lifestyle.  And chain smoke.  How tall is he?  Wow.  He was a big dude, like 6'5".  6'5".  Tremendous.  Obese and, uh, real mafia look to him, you know, but Frank was a cool guy, man.  Yeah, very nice guy.  How old?  Nice to be.  52.  He owned this club in Yonkers, the Shooting Stars on Central Avenue. 
[01:59:30]  It was also Grandpa Munsters.  Lyle Alzado was involved.  It was a real mobbed up mess, this place.  There was so much coke in this place.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, he was diabetic, and I had no idea.  He moved to LA to do some acting stuff.  Yeah, he was on Becker a bunch of times, Frank D'Amico.  He, he was, uh, he used to date Lisa Lampanelli, I'm sure.  Oh, my God.  I forgot he used to date her.  Yeah.  White guy?  Disgusting thought that is.  Wow.  Yeah.  Interesting.  Yeah.  How long did he do that?  How bad did he need coke? 
[02:00:00]  Jeez.  Great reaction.  He just did a great yeesh.  His skin is crawling with that thought.  Thanks, Lampanelli.  What was your question?  Wow, he was addicted.  Good.  I forgot he dated Lisa, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, she must be bummed.  Oh, God.  If she even heard.  You know?  It's like they're in different circles.  Yeah, but something like that, you know, too many of you're seeing people.  Yeah.  That stinks.  Yeah, it's a shame, I know.  What did he die of?  Um, complications from diabetes and stuff. 
[02:00:30]  It's fun time here in the O&A show.  Thanks, Otto.  It's comedy time.  Thanks, Otto.  Now, this is comedy.  What else is going on in America today?  How about this?  On a lighter note, Kennedy has creased slacks.  But the good news is, um, Ted Kennedy's going to be okay.  They cut his head open and they found seawater and a pair of panties.  He is saying today he wants to be, you know, buried with his brothers. 
[02:01:00]  Oh.  Yeah, that's, uh, that's the news on Ted Kennedy today.  What did anybody, of course that's where he's going to be buried.  What did he think?  They were going to take him somewhere and not bury him with his brothers?  Yeah, they're going to put him next to Soupy Sales?  Of course, he's a Kennedy.  Yeah, but he's not like, you know, one of those Kennedys.  Not one of the big, you know.  Yeah.  He took a hint.  One down, one down, all right, all right.  Yeah.  All right.  I won't even try.  God.  Quiet.  I'll be on the sidelines.  Yes.  I'll be over here.  For my career.  I'll be over here.  Yeah.  And then amazing news, Tiger Woods is out for the year. 
[02:01:30]  Not a lot of golf fans in studio.  Boring, stupid.  It's not even a sport.  I'm obsessed with golf.  Bowling.  I'm obsessed with Tiger Woods.  Bowling, billiards, and golf are not sports.  There's skills.  There has to be a chance for an injury.  We had a whole discussion with Patrice O'Neal about that.  What does he say?  He agrees with you.  Yeah.  There should be.  It's a skill.  It's not a sport.  It's a stupid white man pastime. 
[02:02:00]  What do we come up with?  There should be some kind of defense to call it a sport.  Ah, good point.  Or action, or excitement, or entertainment.  So as far as golf goes, if all of a sudden someone comes running at you as you're trying  to hit the golf ball, then you can call it a sport.  Yeah.  A guy swinging a Galliano bottle at your head while you try and make the cup.  Yeah.  That'd be wonderful.  Throwing folding chairs at you.  Anything.  Out of all those spectators, if you had maybe 10 of those spectators could run on the course 
[02:02:30]  at any given moment and try to tackle Tiger Woods, then you could call it a sport.  Exactly.  He's got enough money.  Stop.  A season-ending surgery, though, man.  He basically broke his knee and still was competing for the U.S. Open.  How'd he break his knee, did he say?  Running, like almost a year ago, stump brain.  Yeah, he tore a ligament.  He, excuse me.  Yeah.  He tore a ligament in the left knee and also had two stress fractures in the same leg he  played with the entire round.  From jogging?  Yeah, he works out pretty hard.  A couple times a day. 
[02:03:00]  He was running after the British Open last year, right?  That's when the injury occurred?  And then still played and ignored the fact that he had a stress fracture?  Yeah.  Fracture?  Yeah, and he had the tear and he played 12 tournaments and only won nine of them with  a torn ligament.  Boy, so he really works out twice a day?  Yeah.  Oh, he's an animal, yeah.  That's why he's so strong.  Well, he brought fitness to the activity of golf.  What did he do?  A back flip off his wallet?  How did he hurt himself playing golf?  They don't understand that because you don't really get this injury playing golf. 
[02:03:30]  But I guess it was from running and then you do twist the knee a little bit when you're  swinging.  Mixed bag partial lawn jockey.  I hope he suffers the rest of the year.  He's going to.  He's out for the season.  Oh, good.  You don't like golf?  I don't care.  Do you like any sport, Otto?  You mean for viewing?  What's your sport?  Yeah.  I really don't have one.  I mean, baseball, if it came, I would watch a baseball game.  That'd be good therapy too, wouldn't it? 
[02:04:00]  You had to say that.  No, I just, I like baseball because an average size guy could be a superstar.  It's not genetics where, you know, as a guy like, you know, a Hulk Hogan, you know, I  could never tackle a Hulk Hogan or be a great basketball star because I'm just not, it's  just not in my DNA.  But a guy my size could be a superstar in baseball, you know, with the skill, you know what I'm  saying?  With the right skill, of course.  An average size guy, you know.  A regular Joe.  Yeah.  A regular Joe.  And that's why you like baseball? 
[02:04:30]  Leave me alone.  What do I know?  Oh, I like sumo wrestling.  I really enjoy that.  Sumo wrestling.  Yes.  When it's never on, but it's very interesting.  Well, they look very sexy in their thongs.  Yeah.  Whatever the hell they're called, right?  Fat, sweaty, nips, ball bag.  What about ultimate fighting?  Not too much.  In the beginning, it's too popular.  I don't know.  I lost, I tuned out when it became really popular. 
[02:05:00]  I used to like hoist, uh, hoist Gracie.  What was that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Gracie family.  That guy was insane.  You don't like the, uh, like Liddell or, I want to go, I want to go to Vegas July 4th  and see Rampage Jackson fight.  I really want to do that, man.  Yeah.  Those are great fights.  Yeah.  They're short, but.  Yeah.  We got an invite from Dana White yesterday on the show.  Well, you guys got one, but I'll show up anyway.  No, you got one too, Jimmy.  You know that.  I want to be fresh.  Huh?  What are you guys doing for Halloween this year?  Dressing up like a funny character.  I mean, are you going to do any like radio live broadcast? 
[02:05:30]  I'd love to come.  Halloween?  I'm looking at the calendar.  What?  I'm going to ask what we're doing for the 4th of July.  Oh, before you know it, it'll be here.  I am.  We should do a big Halloween thing.  I think so too.  Yeah, we'll do a Halloween party.  They always work out well.  We can have a costume contest.  Yeah.  And give away prizes for the best costume of the night.  And instead of bobbing for apples, we'll have people bob for something that's really phallic.  Yeah, we never do that, did we?  You were talking about John Denver before. 
[02:06:00]  When I was a kid, one of my bits, I used to do, sunshine on my shoulder gives me sunburn.  That was my act before I got into the C's and the F's.  Really?  Yeah.  Does that make you sad or angry?  Oh, angry, yeah.  It's angry.  At Otto's place, I went to his place for a party he was having and he had a bunch of,  his girlfriend hung a bunch of photos, old photos of Otto.  You looked a lot like Malcolm McDowell when you were a kid, like a clockwork orange. 
[02:06:30]  Really?  I wore a derby, but my influence was Laurel and Hardy.  It wasn't, I mean, the reason I wore a derby was from Laurel and Hardy movies, not from  Clockwork Orange.  Your face and the way your hair was, your little ear was exposed.  Oh.  And there's really cool shots of Otto around the city, just a little boy with his little  wooden friend, and one of the shots in front of 1515 Broadway, the MTV building, long before  it was the MTV building.  It's really cool, man.  You should put those on a website.  They are on my website.  Don't scream at me.  Sorry, I'm just trying to be supportive. 
[02:07:00]  Why don't you emasculate me in front of the whole country?  Let's make him talk about sports again.  We'll get you back, Otto.  All right.  We'll get you back.  Yeah.  Well, we can do a quickie before we get out of here.  What sport do you like, Ope?  Hockey's my favorite.  Hockey, yeah.  Just because it's a lot of action.  I used to like basketball, but Anthony talked me out of liking basketball because he made  a lot of sense with it.  Funk.  Oh.  Funk.  Funk.  Funk.  Funk.  Two points.  Funk.  Funk.  Funk.  Two points.  Like, the whole part of a sport and the excitement of watching a sport is watching the team score.  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  And they do it constantly.  Oh, okay.  Throughout the entire game, it's just, down the other end of the court, yeah, a pass, pass,  and shoots, he scores.  It's like watching the stock market or something like it goes up and down and up.  Yeah, who cares?  Yeah.  It's like, it doesn't matter, when the score is in the hundreds, when you get two points  a clip, sometimes three, that's dull.  It's not like football.  When they score a touchdown, you're like, yeah, that was exciting.  We hit Bruno Tattaglia two o'clock this morning.  What happened?  Ah, I don't know.  After he made those baseball comments. 
[02:08:00]  Sonny got mad.  Then I like football.  Baseball, probably my least favorite.  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah.  Because it's just boring.  It's slow.  I like a nice day going to the game.  I don't talk about the strategy of a baseball game.  That's what I like.  Who gives a crap?  Yeah.  It's a nice hang.  Yeah.  Just when you see it live at the ballpark, you see how fast they're throwing that ball.  Though it doesn't register on television how fast that ball is coming.  It's a lot more fun to watch a baseball game live.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  All sports, for that matter. 
[02:08:30]  I like to go to the game and root inappropriately.  Yeah.  Like, if the team is losing the home team, I'll just start going, come on, guys, let's  put some home runs up there on the board.  God.  Oh, my God.  You guys want to do a quickie?  We got a tranny beating up...  Oh, my God.  Beat by the police.  Why?  We got a man robbing a 12-year-old's lemonade stand.  Which one are you feeling?  This first tragic story.  The tranny?  This beautiful young lady boy.  All right.  Hi, Daddy.  Beat by the police, sir. 
[02:09:00]  Adam, what do you think of trannies?  What do I think of them?  Yeah, you got an opinion either way?  Jimmy's a big fan, or he used to be a big fan.  He wasn't a big fan.  We're all big fans.  I don't know.  The creepy Adam's apple and the big hands and the knock knees.  I don't know.  They're talking.  Stop.  Here's the story.  They're lost.  The brutal beating of a transsexual prostitute by a Memphis police officer, and it's all caught  on tape.  It's a disturbing case of police brutality at the Memphis Police Department.  I uncovered this exclusive video, which shows a Memphis police... 
[02:09:30]  How did she uncover it?  I am...  She's been a white, brutal bastard.  She just Googled tranny beating, and it came up.  God.  ...video, which shows a Memphis police officer beating a suspect at 201 Poplar.  We want to warn you, some of the video and language you are about to see and hear may be considered  disturbing.  This police video shows Dewana Johnson in the booking area at 201 Poplar after an arrest  for prostitution.  Where's Eddie Murphy when you need him? 
[02:10:00]  ...institution.  You can clearly see the Memphis police officer walk over and hit her in the face several  times.  Wow.  So why did it happen?  Actually, he was trying to get me to come over to where he was, and I responded by telling  her that that wasn't my name.  My mother didn't name me a faggot or a he, she.  So he got upset and approached me, and that's when it started.  Was it the use of the word faggot that they had to warn the audience about? 
[02:10:30]  Is that what I'm being led to believe here?  I'm guessing.  That's the language that was...  Yeah.  Maybe.  Holy Jesus, are we just a nation of boobs?  Yeah.  Do we stink?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Doomed.  But cops are getting so stupid.  It's like, you know everything is being videotaped.  Yeah.  I'm not talking about when it happens in the street where you're having a confrontation and  you just beat down a guy who you're chasing or whatever.  But you're in the state.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  You know everything is videotaped.  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  So stupid.  I think it's just...  I don't think they're thinking at that point.  That's just it.  It's very hot in Memphis, you know.  They're very hot and overworked, sure.  Especially after these chases.  Yeah.  You know what it must be like?  Your adrenaline's pumping.  Sure.  You finally get this ass out of the car that's, you know, jeopardized your life, other people's  lives, and you run over and tackle them, and maybe they're resisting a little, getting  the cuffs on.  Yeah.  You just want to drill your hand into their face.  Yeah.  And you would hope your sergeant would back you up on that kind of excessive violence. 
[02:11:30]  You'd hope the cameraman would put the camera down, maybe tape what's going on behind  him.  Yeah.  I didn't see nothing.  Yeah.  Got more to the story.  Well, there's more.  According to Dewana, the officer was trying to get Dewana, a transsexual, to get fingerprinted,  but she says she didn't respond to the derogatory name he called her.  He said, I'm telling you, I'm giving you one more chance to get up.  So I'm looking at him, and he started putting his gloves on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[02:12:00]  Was it snowing out?  If not, you better get up.  He's putting his gloves on.  A big sap, lead-filled glove, like the old days.  I'm thinking L.A. myself.  A big boxing glove.  Start putting his gloves on.  The officer hits her several times, with the handcuffs wrapped around his knuckles.  In the video, you can see the flash of metal.  Another officer holds her shoulders.  She tries to protect herself.  After taking several blows, Dewana stands up and swings back. 
[02:12:30]  I was afraid.  I mean, I had had enough.  Like I said, I thought the other officers that were witnessing this would at least try  to stop him.  I mean, he hit me so hard, like the third time, it split my skull, and I had blood coming  down.  That's why I jumped up.  She sits back down, and the officer hits her in the face again.  You can see other people in the room turning away and fanning because of the smell of the  mace.  Wow, this guy's a bruiser. 
[02:13:00]  Stomp the stodomite.  That's great.  Why is that news?  We ask that question all the time.  I'm being a freak.  And here's what the cop was saying.  You can act like a man, and a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[02:13:30]  We got one more clip here.  Great.  One more clip.  And we know that this video has been reviewed by both the district attorney's office and  the FBI.  The DA's office dropped all charges against Dewana Johnson.  The feds are investigating whether a civil rights violation occurred.  The police department confirms that the officer holding Johnson was still on probation and  has now been fired.  The officer who threw the punches is currently on non-enforcement status pending an administrative  hearing. 
[02:14:00]  Not good.  Driving a desk.  Not good.  Yeah, we don't know why that's news, Otto.  That's a very good question.  I think I know what happened was he picked up this transgendered individual and was ripped  off.  He was not as advertised.  He said, nine, fully functional.  Sure sounded like a lady.  Yeah, it was very believable.  Hey, and then he punched me with the handcuffs. 
[02:14:30]  Dewana Patrice O'Neal.  Sounded like Leon Spinks a little bit.  Yeah.  Been wondering what Leon Spinks has been up to.  Well, Otto, that's our music showboat, hotel and casino.  July 5th, one show only, ladies and gentlemen.  House of Blues, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Who are you working with?  Just you?  A young lady named Patty Rossboro.  Oh, Patty's funny, man.  Yeah.  We like the Patty.  She's doing this tour with Eric McManus.  Yeah, last time I worked with Levy and I didn't want a dirty guy before me.  I wanted a regular comic and then me. 
[02:15:00]  Patty's really funny, man.  Yeah.  And OttoandGeorge.com.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll try this.  You can see my Malcolm McDowell pictures up there.  Jimmy was right.  It's very close.  He looks like him, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Like a young Malcolm.  Yeah.  You had very dark hair back in the day, huh?  Well, I didn't dye it or anything.  I know.  It's a very dark brown.  Are you coming to XM with us, Otto?  Yeah.  You want to go curse? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  I would love to say,  I would love to say,  Whoa.  We'll go to the dirty word show.  That's a cool picture, man.  I love these old shots.  Yeah, go to OttoandGeorge.com.  Check out the pics.  Put these on your website.  They already are.  Stop yelling.  We're going to go curse.  Thank you, fellas.  Yeah, let's go curse.  Bye.  Before you get pissed off at us, man, 
[02:16:00]  we have nothing to do with this.  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what?  I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people  who can't see the good in anything.  Off the air.  Let's say racist things to each other.  Hold on, hold on.  And really turn them off. 
[02:16:30]  Excellence in broadcasting.  Our anus.  Watch it again?  Oh, oh.  Our anus.  What?  Stop.  Enough about the anus.  Ah, this is hurtful.  This is hurtful.  No one wants to hear this on their radio show.  I'll collapse on our floor.  It's just potty mouth day.  You may feel shame, but all the same, 
[02:17:00]  you are my knees in pain.  O.B.  Anthony.  Shush.  Jim Norton.  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Otto made the walk. 
[02:17:30]  We like that.  Otto from Otto and George in studio.  Here at XM Satellite Radio.  He's playing the showboat hotel and casino down there in Atlantic City.  House of Blues, actually.  Yeah.  On July 5th.  And the promoter's bitching.  So we buy a ticket and go see Otto and George, please.  July 5th.  And then there's crime and vice afterwards.  There's gambling and, you know, whatever you need, you know?  Debauchery.  Yeah.  It sounds like you're just going to see a show and go home.  We're getting that Atlantic City together, finally. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  There's a few good hotels to go to now.  Yeah.  There's a few scary ones.  Most of them are real shitholes.  Yeah.  Most of them are like old school.  They haven't updated them.  Yeah.  It's like 1970.  Depressing old people.  Yeah.  I went to, I don't know how many people play there, so maybe I'll just keep my mouth shut  about where it is.  But I went to one of the hotels on the boardwalk area.  And there was orange shag carpeting and a jacuzzi tub that looked like it was from 1976. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Like, all the controls were busted.  And you probably had one of the nicer rooms, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you go downstairs and there were old women that looked like they should be working  at diners.  Yeah.  And they're, you know, slinging the booze to the players at the table.  And then you go over to the Borgata and you're like, holy shit.  The only problem with the Borgata is you're not on the boardwalk, so you can't not gamble.  You can't just go on the boardwalk and listen to the ocean for 10 minutes. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  I don't care.  Yeah.  I just, I listen to the chips.  Yeah.  Crink, crink.  But the Borgata babes are there.  So, you know, you got the girls to look at.  The I can't eat.  What do you like to eat when you go there?  Well, they got a few pretty good restaurants.  Yeah, the Homestead's really good.  Yeah.  And then they got that, what is it?  Wolfgang Puck's.  Yeah.  That's good stuff.  Bobby Flays.  Bobby Flays is good.  You just feel like you're in Vegas when you go to the Borgata.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Borgata's like a pretty upper crust place. 
[02:19:30]  We went to one hotel, the Philly crew, and wow, after midnight, I mean, the prostitutes  just took over the entire casino.  It was like scary.  Really?  Did you stay there or you guys were just hanging?  We stayed there, yeah.  We went for cheaper rooms or whatever, and everything was cool until it got a little too late.  And then, I'm not kidding, man.  It was infested with prostitutes everywhere.  Really?  Everywhere.  They don't discourage it or even try and act like it's not?  No.  They just let it happen, man. 
[02:20:00]  I mean, they literally took over.  Do you like to gamble?  I don't picture you being a big gambler.  I like a little three-card poker, a little blackjack.  I'd do it for fun more than anything, the social aspect.  I'm not in it for the big win or anything like that.  Come on in for the big win.  I love three-card, actually, and I know it's pretty much a sucker's game, but it's fun.  Yeah.  You know, it's pretty good.  Sit at a table with a bunch of guys and just, you know, fuck around for a couple hours.  If you're not going to make 10 grand, if you don't mind losing a few bucks, I... 
[02:20:30]  What a fucking ant I sound like.  Well, you know what, though?  Just play what you can afford to lose.  Take your pin money.  My biggest loss at a casino is way under $1,000.  Oh, that's exciting.  I never get into big hands or anything like that.  Wow.  That's foolish.  If I'm up $100,000 or $200,000, it's exciting to me.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  That's it.  That's what I tip.  I understand.  It's like what I've thrown.  I've thrown the dealer that many times.  And more than that, I think I tipped a grand once. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  But I love when you take them...  I want a $35,000 hand.  I love when you take them for everything, and then they go, would you like the keys to  our plane?  You know, they want to get you back there.  They're so miserable.  That's what they did.  Otto.  They're so fucking miserable that you...  Yeah.  I love that.  That happened to Anthony.  Yeah.  He's a whale.  Gave him to some of these places now.  They got him the plane.  Yeah.  And flew him back up to try to take some of that money back.  And you took him again?  Oh, no, no.  I broke even, and that was just because Keith, the cop, took all my chips. 
[02:21:30]  Oh.  I had lost the entire weekend, and I was down probably $50,000.  Wow.  And then the last 45 minutes that we were there, I mean, bags are packed.  They're in the lobby.  We're waiting for the limo to take us to the plane, and I'm just betting like a maniac.  And I got on a streak and just started winning, winning, winning.  Keith looks.  He goes, boom, boom, boom.  Takes the chips.  He goes, all right, here's $50,000.  I'm taking it to the window.  You play with this.  He goes, you're even, at least. 
[02:22:00]  Even as far as you didn't give back what you originally won?  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't give back originally, and I wound up leaving with what I came with.  Oh, that's good.  You lost 50 G's, and then you won 50 G's.  50 G's.  But to break even, when you're getting the shit kicked out of you, it's like a lot of times  a whale will go in, and he'll start to bugger.  Yeah.  That's a casino term.  Bugger, is it?  Bugger?  He's buggering.  Yeah, Anthony, I don't have the bug like Anthony.  I like just to be a little social.  Oh, that friggin'.  Have a few drinks, play a few hands.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Walk around and look at people.  Oh, that adrenaline you get when you got like two hands at a time, and you started out like  with eight grand on each hand.  Are you talking about blackjack?  Yeah.  Oh, that's what you like, right?  Yeah, that's the big money game.  I like poker too, but you're not going to get rich or go broke playing poker for the most  part, the way I play, and the level I play at, but blackjack's huge.  So you play two hands, you lay down $8,000, like table max on each one, so that's like  $16,000 right there, and then you get in certain situations where you got to double down, like 
[02:23:00]  on both hands, so there's $32,000 riding on it, and then that dealer turns over cars  and busts or something, or you hit a great hand, and it's just one of those things where  you're like, oh, that's great.  But losing those?  Yeah.  Especially when the dealer is showing, say the dealer is showing a four, and I got 20  on both hands, and they just, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, dink, dink, dink, dink,  dink, dink, 21. 
[02:23:30]  That's so funny.  It's like six cards come out and add up to 21.  You're like, what the fuck just happened?  So after losing-  I lose my goddamn mind when that happens.  After losing a major hand like that, do you lower your bet, or do you-  Yeah, yeah, I lower it, I try to shake it off.  Yeah.  It's very hard.  Sometimes I sit back in the chair, I'll take a breath or two, I'll wait for the waitress.  You got to shake those off.  You can't try to make it back on the next hand either.  You got to just sit there and go, okay, it's rebuild time.  Right.  That's the worst.  Rebuild time. 
[02:24:00]  So you go back in low and try to rebuild what you got.  That's intense.  And then make your big bets.  Yeah, my mother was there.  So if your friend hadn't taken those-  I can't watch you.  If your friend hadn't taken those 50,000 in chips to the window for you, you think you  probably would have pissed it away too?  That's just it.  You never know.  I could have made it 100,000.  I could have been completely broke.  The point is, he would have continued playing, absolutely.  You haven't gambled in a while.  That's cool.  It's been quite a while.  That's cool.  What's that about?  Just taking a break?  I haven't had the time or really.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Usually there's a reason to go to the casino.  We're down there.  We're close.  I usually don't go just to go to a casino.  Right.  Usually if we're on our way to Boston, I'll leave a day earlier or, you know, stuff like  that.  Yeah.  But for the most part, I'm going to be staying down in the Caribbean, let's say, for a few  days.  Nice.  And they've got a casino down there, so I'll get to play a little.  Very cool.  Well, we look forward to the gambling report. 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  You'll hear that.  We've got a few people on the bleachers, and Stalker Patty's just yapping.  What is she yapping about?  The guy's here to see the show, not listening to you, Stalker Patty.  You might have heard in the background some yapping.  That was Stalker Patty.  What are you telling this guy?  Patty started when I was standing outside.  Yeah.  So far, I heard her computer took a crap because she spilled coffee into it.  Yeah.  And she's asking me for tech advice.  Yeah.  Do you know Patty? 
[02:25:30]  Patty, I just know her just from the show or whatever.  Right.  So this is your first real meeting?  The first valid conversation.  Valid.  You'll never get one of those.  Yeah, that's what it is.  This poor guy.  What's your name, sir?  Jason.  Jason's sitting on the bleachers.  His aunt's talking about gambling with Otto, and I hear in the background, it's like,  and I feel sorry for the guy because he's really trying to listen to the show.  And Patty's giving aunt gambling tips.  Oh, so you've got to stay with 17.  Don't go over 17.  Oh, yeah.  The basics. 
[02:26:00]  I don't know that just from watching people at the tables, I learned that way.  Oh, you did.  But I don't play it myself.  No.  What do you play, Patty?  No.  If I go once in the blue moon, I play a nickel machine or a quarter machine and then go watch  the bands play in the bars there.  Oh, sick.  I'd love her to get her knuckles broken.  Oh, would that be great?  Oh, some backroom justice.  Yeah.  She owes three nickels.  They break their knuckles with an anvil.  She's got a marker for 15 cents. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  She can't pay it off.  That's right.  It's my bus fare.  I need it for the jitney to get home.  Please don't break me.  Jitneys don't take you back to New York.  Oh, shut up.  We're doing jokes.  I know.  And they really wouldn't break your knuckles with an anvil for 15 cents.  For 15 cents.  Although we wish they would.  Yeah.  Put her head in a vice and pop her eyes out.  Drop a storm window on her throat would be good.  Go with her voice.  What else was she babbling about?  Just, you know.  The whole time.  The refrigerator's not working. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, I've got to say that.  The rest of the bleachers are now jumping in.  I've got to say, she smells good, Patty.  Smells different than I thought she would smell.  What does she smell like?  Like 53-year-old virgin?  I don't know if it's her or this other beautiful young lady here in the front, but...  Who do you think?  Danny?  No, not your part.  I do take showers, you know.  Do you?  How often, Patty?  Twice a day, because it's hot.  Jesus, what are you, just shitting while you type?  Why would you... 
[02:27:30]  Twice a day?  No, it's too hot.  Sometimes I need to jump in there three times in the day just to cool off.  What a fucking billy goat you are.  Don't you have air conditioning?  Do you have AC?  What?  Do you have air conditioning?  No, I don't.  In my open window.  Do you have a fan?  No.  Why don't you get something to blow air on you?  What's the matter with you?  Because I have a cat, and I want to get a fan that's going to be safe for her because  she's too curious.  She's got a screen on it.  Wait, wait, wait.  What are you talking about? 
[02:28:00]  What do you think they are?  My cat, she's into everything.  I'm afraid she'll injure herself.  She's going to stick her paw into a fan?  So you're taking three hours, fucking three showers a day because your faggot cat doesn't  know how to put her fucking hand in a fan?  Do you know if you get a fan on a stand, like one of those oscillating ones, the cat  ain't going to get up there and stick his fucking paw in there?  And how about you only turn it on when you're there?  Why would you want the fan on when you're fucking in Schenectady?  Yeah.  I don't go to Schenectady.  All right.  Oh, that's a suggestion.  Okay.  That's not a suggestion.  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Okay.  Fucking, she just leaves the still dead air thickly creeping into her room.  Oh, that's got to be the worst.  I need another shower.  Why don't you just queef against the wall and then put your face in?  I can't help it.  The shower feels good when it's hot.  Living in New York in the summertime blows if you don't have a fan.  Yeah, really?  Really?  Just having a window open and the smells and the sounds and ugh.  Rotten apartments.  Doesn't the city provide relief for semi or indigent people?  Isn't there some program? 
[02:29:00]  I love this guy.  I don't try for those things anymore.  I'm not eligible.  What do you mean?  How could you not be eligible?  You live in the city?  You have to make, you have to, number one, you got to be on welfare to get that kind of  help and I'm not.  I work.  And number two, you know, they only allow for people who make $700, $800 a month and  my $1,000 a month doesn't qualify.  So that's it.  I give up.  I'm not applying anymore.  Almost $1,000 a month, Patty.  Look at you, huh? 
[02:29:30]  You're rocking.  Why don't we buy Patty a fan?  How great would it be if a cat was killed three days after she got it?  Oh, how great.  Or just not killed, just the paws were amputated, just cut off and the little thing walks around  and little stumps.  She's a pawless cat.  Yeah.  It's just, it's all low in the front like an old time race car.  I want to get a fan and then smear catnip all over the blades.  So he tries to make love to it. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Well, Patty's in the bleachers.  What time should wife get home?  Yeah.  We got Lisa Sparks here.  Lisa.  You want to bring Lisa in?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Well, set her up nice there, Danny.  Bring the bitch in.  Bring the bitch in.  Otto, what do you think of these feeders?  Did you just call them feeders?  Oh, sorry.  Feeders?  You weren't supposed to hear that.  Just kidding.  I was just joking.  She's a good girl.  I try.  I was flashing you outside.  I was all, you know. 
[02:30:30]  I had panties on, but, you know.  So, how much sex did you have after the show yesterday?  Some.  Some?  How many?  Two times, I think.  With who?  No, three times.  Three times.  With who?  Well, he's right out there.  Your husband?  No.  No.  Who's the guy?  This is my friend, Matt.  Look at him.  He's going to be like, oh my God, oh my God, don't do that.  Wait, you had sex with Matt?  I did.  I had sex with Matt last night.  Three times? 
[02:31:00]  No, two times.  The third time with somebody else.  The one in the studio?  No.  Another one.  I didn't have sex with him.  I tried to blow him, remember?  Yeah, I know.  You were attempting to blow one of our guys yesterday.  Jeez.  Jeez.  Wait, so you had sex with Matt, and then who was the other guy?  Just another guy.  That happens to be in town?  Yeah.  I guess.  Heavens to Betsy.  Ted from out of town.  The guy was, uh.  I don't know.  Was he a generous friend?  His name was, yes.  He was very generous. 
[02:31:30]  Very generous.  I like that.  Very generous.  And the husband doesn't care?  Absolutely not.  You know what he did?  He called me and he goes, you should go on their show all the time.  I go, why?  And he goes, because we made a crap load of money yesterday.  Ah.  Really?  And I was like, okay.  Otto, what do you think of Lisa Sparks with three X's?  Very outgoing, sparkly, lovely woman.  Sparky personality.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I try.  She's the one.  You might have been listening because you were on your way in still.  We tried to get her to do something to Cream Pie Jones, one of our guys. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  He had a panic attack, a nervous breakdown, ended up running out of the studio.  He puked the rest of the morning.  God.  And he called in sick today.  Did he really?  He's out of his fucking mind.  Wow.  And then he hung up on us today.  So we don't even know, you know, we were trying to get to the bottom of some things and  he just hung up.  Is he shy or is, I mean, what is it?  What was his, what was he trying to say?  I don't even know.  Yeah.  That he, I think he was trying to pawn it off as he was disappointed in himself because  he brought the show down. 
[02:32:30]  He couldn't do something for the show.  But the truth of the matter is, I think he just freaked out.  Maybe he thought his parents were listening or something.  We don't know.  He didn't give us enough.  He didn't like the number of guys in the studio.  Don't worry.  Yeah.  It's okay.  You'll get cum somewhere.  I'm like, well, I was thinking it's not the first time it's ever happened.  And in case you missed yesterday's show, what we were alluding to earlier, we wanted  Lisa Sparks to make cumzies in Cream Pie Jones pants.  Really?  Yeah.  Just through like his pants and then make a mess in his pants. 
[02:33:00]  That's pretty hard to do.  We wanted to make cumzies.  Yeah.  That's a hard to do trick.  So you need silk boxers and a really great lap dancer.  I've dumped in my pants once.  Really?  Yeah.  It was in New Orleans.  Because the girl kept trying to get me going for much more money in the back room.  And just strictly through your pants.  Just keep doing that.  I had boxers on.  It looked like somebody fire hosed me.  I was working with Louis Ramey and Pete Correale.  Fire hosed.  I fucking went out and I showed them and they were so disgusted. 
[02:33:30]  Pete's like, what the fuck, man?  You know, penis.  I'll give you some tips because some guy came up to me at a convention and said he had tips  on how to go to a strip club and if the girl will ride you for extra.  He says, wear two pairs of underwear and already put the condom on.  He's like, and then he can go out.  Nobody ever knows.  I was like.  No, no.  I just kept my pants.  I had my jeans on.  She was just giving me a label.  No, that's what he says.  Underneath all that.  And then that way you can make cumzies.  So that way when you leave, nobody knows what you did.  And throw the condom away. 
[02:34:00]  Well, I wouldn't think that anybody would care either, but apparently.  I wear my loads like a badge of honor.  That's my fucking world.  That's my purple heart.  I do too.  Right there in front of my slacks.  I do too.  I like them very much.  Can we get Cream Pie Jones back on the phone?  Yeah, let's talk to him.  We need to.  Now that Lisa Sparks is on the show, we got to find out what the fuck happened.  Fudge.  Jimmy, you know you're giving me one of those.  One of my favorite snacks is in front of you right now.  What, her breasts?  I would love to snack on them.  Low-fat peanut butter.  And celery.  Celery. 
[02:34:30]  I get some celery.  It's not a bad snack.  It's a great snack.  Why don't we get the star of the show today, Pat from Manaki in the studio.  Pat.  Oh, yeah.  What's the peanut butter and celery like?  No, thank you.  No, Otto?  No.  Here he comes.  First thing in.  Hi, guys.  Look at Pat.  Look.  Acting like he's happy and love life.  Take a seat in the Captain Kirk chair.  Look at him.  Everything's good.  Hey, guys.  Engage.  What's up, Pat? 
[02:35:00]  Oh, nothing yet.  You got to talk into the mic a little bit better.  Pat, you know what you can do?  Why don't you rip it off the mic stand and hold it there.  Yeah, hold it.  There you go.  There you go, Pat.  So, Pat, we've been trying to get you laid for a very long time.  Wow.  Yes, that's mighty nice of you.  Why can't I hear Pat?  My phone.  I'm trying now, Pat.  What would it be?  It might have been me.  Where's my headphones?  There you go, Pat.  So, Pat hasn't had action in how long, Pat?  Any type. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, quite some time.  At least 20 years.  When was the last time you jerked off there, Pat?  Last night.  Oh, wow.  Well, you got a lot of advice, right?  I heard you were getting a lot of advice from the peeps out there.  Oh, yeah.  They were telling you to jerk off.  I had strangers just walking up to me in the street yesterday just saying,  good luck tomorrow with that blowjob.  Why were they telling you to jerk off? 
[02:36:00]  No, they weren't telling me to jerk off.  No, but you should.  I took it upon myself.  Why?  That's my normal daily prostate maintenance.  I had a little bit of that earlier, too, so that's great.  His knees are making me very angry.  Why?  I just want to injure them.  Papatelio, he already tried that.  Otto, Pat's very lovable.  Why would you want to hurt him?  Look at him.  He's a lovable guy.  Look at him. 
[02:36:30]  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Let's cuddle.  Splitted that shin bone into a million pieces.  I know.  That's rather.  My shin bone would bash it apart like an eggplant.  So, Pat, we wanted Pat to meet Lisa because Lisa's very, very sexy.  We figured maybe they could just talk a little bit.  You can make his day there, Lisa.  We even said hi two or three times outside already.  Yeah.  What's your first thought of Pat from Munaki now that you see him live?  Very nice.  Very nice?  Very nice.  He's a nice guy, right?  Very nice guy. 
[02:37:00]  Very nice guy.  He's a lot of fun.  Could Lisa at least maybe, have you guys touched at all?  Like hugged?  I think I maybe slapped him on the arm, but I don't think that was sexual in nature.  That's why I came in my pants.  Cumsies?  Yeah.  No.  Lisa, you want to give Pat a nice hug?  I can.  I have the right top on for it today, so yeah.  Yeah, you got a low top halter thing happening.  I know, right?  For the double Ds.  I got it.  For my friends.  No, I got to get it up.  Yeah, Pat.  Maybe you should stay there, Pat, and let Lisa just hug you while you're in the chair. 
[02:37:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  Hugs, not drugs.  Right, right?  Except Viagra.  And think of Larry Fine while you're doing it.  Hi, dear.  I'm one of you.  Mom never hugged me like this.  I know, right?  Hold that one time.  Pat, why don't you hold her hiney?  What are you doing?  Okay.  Be nice, Pat.  There you go.  Was that mic working, Danny?  Hold on.  Let me turn around.  Fucking Jim.  Could you turn on the wireless, please?  But I did really, by the way, wore Lisa's purple underwear for the Lakers, and that was 
[02:38:00]  bad, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It didn't help at all.  No, it did not help at all.  Pat, what do you think?  Well, lovely.  Really?  Oh.  Yeah.  Is that better?  Would you like to hear a story?  Sure.  Danny, will you tell me a story?  She's sitting on Pat's knee.  On his lap, really.  I'm all, ooh.  What would you like for Christmas?  You.  Ooh.  Nice. 
[02:38:30]  Now she's gyrating a bit, too.  And bouncing up and down on Pat.  I know.  Lisa, any action down there?  Oh, no.  On Pat's like, oh, no.  She's reaching back.  I'm working on it.  She's reaching back.  It wouldn't take long, I don't think.  Really?  Yeah.  You're very confident, huh?  Yeah.  You can call me Cecil B. Turtle.  What did she say?  Cecil B. Turtle.  Cecil B. Turtle.  It's okay.  Okay.  Hey, Pat, would you like to feel the melons?  Ooh. 
[02:39:00]  What, do we have a buffet?  Right?  Okay, hold on.  I can actually bring them out?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Pat, would you like to feel some melons?  Sure.  When in Rome.  When was the last time you felt melons?  When in Rome.  This morning when I washed.  Kill it.  Oh, oh, hi.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Good Lord.  All right, they're cutting a torture face.  Okay.  I had to teach him how to motorboat. 
[02:39:30]  Pat, do a motorboat.  Okay.  I motorboat these things.  Thanks.  Jeez.  That was a fart.  It was close enough.  It was close enough.  It was close enough.  Why?  You don't like to spit all over your boobs?  Pat, you're supposed to go back and forth of more of a woman.  Oh.  I'll teach him that later.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Pat, be a, be a, she's a, what would you say to her, like, not even comedically,  what would you say to her for real?  You're a guy.  Like, what would you say really, like, sexually to her?  Like, what would you like to do?  Without being comical or anything, like, just you as a guy. 
[02:40:00]  Uh.  Uh.  How's it going?  What would you like to do?  Like, what, like.  Oh, what would I like to do?  I'll be sexy, man.  Oh, the, uh, uh, sweet, uh, sweet, uh, kisses on the, uh, the, uh, breasts.  Yeah, so you would like to be tender.  Okay.  Pat likes to be tender.  Cuddle.  I was going to say, we're going to have a slow, gentle thing.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Hey, Lisa, would you let him suckle?  There's nothing wrong with that.  Would you let him suckle just a little bit?  Of course.  Pat.  Pat, when was the last time you suckled a breast? 
[02:40:30]  Uh.  Last night.  Oh.  When I was, I thought you were talking about me.  Sorry.  Right after I was born?  Here, turn to your.  Be gentle.  Yeah, Pat, enjoy it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  The nipple is in the, yeah, that's it.  I, she.  Did he, did you think I was like, have the other one because you can't leave her.  She's jealous.  The other one's jealous.  Worst episode of Nova I've ever seen.  Very symmetrical.  You suck him for real, man.  What are you doing?  He did. 
[02:41:00]  I did.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Like, if you were alone with it, you wouldn't be going around.  Okay.  Make it leave it on here.  Yeah, pretend like none of these people are here.  Yeah.  You don't have any dick sucked in front of this.  Oh, that's actually not bad.  He's not.  He's a gentle guy.  I want very, yes.  He's very gentle.  Yes.  He's very gentle.  Yeah.  I like that.  I like that.  Hold on.  I like that.  He's very gentle.  Oh.  He's going, he's going back with me later.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I've not had sex this morning, so. 
[02:41:30]  Wow.  You might let him throw you a fucking.  There you go.  Maybe.  We'll see.  I'd have to cancel those deliveries I have to do.  You got your own delivery.  You know.  Look at him.  He's digging just kind of playing around.  Because they're like, kind of like, you know.  Oh, they're on your head.  Hey.  They're semi-usually very good for this.  Oh, they're on your head, Pat.  The boobies.  I'm not just the president.  I'm also a member.  Right?  The boob club for men.  That's right.  That's right.  I do that with everybody. 
[02:42:00]  It just seems to be my thing.  Lisa, when you said that panty thing, we forgot to ask.  And it's coming on in some feedback here.  You have changed the panty since the Lakers lost the championship, right?  Yes.  I put them on this morning just because I was.  A few people were horrified by what you said.  No, it's, you know, I'm working on next year.  Okay.  Yeah.  So what do we do now, Pat?  I think she's been a bad girl.  Maybe a little spanking.  Let's see your spanking.  Yeah, she's been bad.  Okay, well, we're dropping things now.  I can't hear anything now. 
[02:42:30]  If he's going to spank me, he has to do it right.  All right, Pat.  Pat, why don't you tell us?  Do you know how to do it correctly?  I think so.  Pat?  I hear you've been bad.  Correctly is cup your hand a little bit.  And make sure that you get it right on the actual ass.  I'll get rid of that piece of wood with a nail in it.  Yeah, right?  Pat, you want her over your knee, obviously.  Okay.  Of course.  I'm going to go like this.  You think your diabetic knees can handle this?  Oh, yeah.  Make sure you get it right there. 
[02:43:00]  Okay.  Ooh.  I was going to say, is he really doing anything, though?  One more.  Pat, you've got to talk her through it.  Keep going.  You've been bad.  Naughty.  Excellent.  You've been bad.  Wow.  I'm still, I'm still, I'm thinking that might get harder.  That's really sexy.  Yeah, me too. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, that one was good.  Here, other side.  All right.  I have to be an even pair.  All right.  That's very sexy talk, Pat.  Now tell her she cheated on her taxes.  Get over Pat's knee there.  There you go.  All right.  Uh, uh, Pat.  What'd you do?  Yeah.  Uh, wait, ask her what you did that made her revenge.  What'd you do so bad?  Jesus.  Uh, I fucked your sister?  I don't know.  My sister?  Your brother?  My dog?  No.  No.  Okay.  Your brother.  It was your brother.  All right. 
[02:44:00]  Talk about his dad.  And your dad, maybe.  Oh, that bastard.  You are bad.  All right.  Thank you.  Wow.  That's the worst.  The unsexiest spanking ever.  I know, right?  Well, what, do you think you can do it better?  I'm a right-handed spanker.  I found out I'm a right-handed spanker.  Are you, like, a better spanker?  Not necessarily a better spanker, but it's like he's too nervous or worried about looking  so like...  Well, that's probably true.  Yeah.  But no, better is subjective.  But am I better?  Yes. 
[02:44:30]  You know, we could always...  Well, don't say that and then go, yeah, I'm better, and then...  Jimmy, we do have the expert spanker in studio today.  We do have E-Rock.  Oh, yeah.  You heard the hoes.  I'm sitting back down.  Sure.  Hold on.  I'm sitting back on you.  Okay.  Is there anything going on now, Lisa?  Yeah.  You know what?  Look.  Let me see.  Pat, do you like your nipples played with?  Uh, not really.  It's not quite a sense...  Yeah.  Pat, what are you a fan of?  What's going on down here?  Are you a fan of, uh, Leonard Skinnerd? 
[02:45:00]  No.  What do you like thrown to you by, uh, a woman?  I'm sorry.  I'm doing it so I can make sure what's going on down here.  I think I shaved a little close last night.  Yeah.  Okay.  You shaved the area?  That was nice of you to do that.  I was trying to get a hold of Marge from Little Shelter, trying to have her divert some  of those Viagras my way.  She couldn't FedEx them overnight.  Oh, goodness.  Oh, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  What's going on, Pat?  Uh, major embarrassment? 
[02:45:30]  It's only because he has blue underwear on.  Jimmy, what's going on over there?  He's got blue underwear on.  He's got blue underwear on.  Oh, yeah.  I left the tighty-whities at home.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness.  The electric blue, uh, the dark navy blue.  The, uh...  He's, uh...  Yep.  I'm on there on the ball.  I am.  I've got his balls.  He's on the balls.  I've got his balls.  They're good.  The ball, they're good.  They're just, uh...  She's sexy, Pat.  Yes.  She's really sexy.  You're so nice.  I mean it.  This is going to end with a, it's not you, it's me. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  But even if your dick doesn't get hard, so much, you let her suck it while it's soft.  It feels good.  I was just going to say, I'm rubbing his balls.  Who cares?  Right?  It's like pizza.  What?  Even bad pizza.  Never mind.  Patty's on the bleachers.  She can't even look.  She won't even look at this.  Patty, get a mic on, Patty.  Patty, get in here.  Pat, come look at this.  She's a guest.  There he is.  I found him.  Isn't that a private moment?  He was.  Private moment?  I found him.  Okay. 
[02:46:30]  I sure get an education.  Oh, hi, Patty.  Hi, Patty.  What?  What's wrong, Patty?  Are we wrecking the moon by bringing Patty in?  This is like Karate Kid 2, where John Freed all of a sudden shows up.  Hi, Patty.  What's going on?  Patty, what's the problem?  Nothing.  I'm just embarrassed.  Patty is the problem.  Why?  Oh, hi.  Patty, explain what's going on over there. 
[02:47:00]  Why?  Well, you can't really see it because, you know, I'm kind of just playing in his pants.  Yeah.  Patty.  I bet you can't guess what's in it.  I see what's in it.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  Hey, did you see that?  Trim those nails.  Hey, I don't have any nails.  Oh, okay.  From observation, but this is a little close.  Yeah.  Hey.  She's getting a little familiar with me.  You're fine, Patty. 
[02:47:30]  Relax.  Yeah.  Patty's inches away from Lisa Sparks and Pat from Munaki.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Talk about the cooler.  Yeah, really?  I'm all high here.  Can I give it a kiss?  A kiss is fair, Pat.  Yeah, that's fair.  I know, right?  I'm just going to give it a kiss.  I hope I don't get kicked out of my eating federation for conduct unbecoming of a tongue.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  No, I can't.  I'm sorry.  Pat.  She just gave it a kiss.  I did.  I just gave it a little kiss. 
[02:48:00]  You know.  She did.  Yeah.  She did.  How was that, Patty?  Would you give it a slow kiss, though?  Because it's probably a quick kiss.  Pat probably could even enjoy it.  Like a little bit slower kiss?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah, it's a slower, soft one.  A gentle, wet one.  Oh, man.  Well, hey.  Tyson.  Yeah, was that slow enough?  Or do you want to...  Maybe a little slower.  Maybe a little slower.  Hey.  Okay.  I can handle that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, hey. 
[02:48:30]  Whoa.  It might have been a time I got caught in the pool, Zach.  Holy shit.  I guess that's a good thing.  I'm not really sure.  Oh, yeah.  Lisa, what's going on over there?  What's going on?  He's there, but I think he's probably nervous because we're laughing.  Yeah, that's it.  Nerves.  Let's not laugh.  Okay.  I don't know.  I think I make people nervous.  Why don't you give him a good how you doing? 
[02:49:00]  What is a good how you doing?  It's like a what for.  Just a fine how do you do.  It's the fine how do you do.  Well.  All right.  We're going to get down here and...  Patty, what's going on?  She's giving him a how do you do.  I didn't even know what it was.  I'm going to make it a...  Give me a howdy doody.  Patty really...  It's howdy doody time.  Patty wants to be dirty so bad, but her upbringing...  Patty likes watching.  Look at her watching.  Well.  She's really looking.  She's making sure she sees everything.  Very interesting.  It wasn't what you were saying yesterday, Opie. 
[02:49:30]  It wouldn't be in front of anybody.  I know.  That's what I said.  Patty's a nobody.  Don't push me in here.  We should send Pat at one point into the other room.  Right now we're just playing, but you will at one point if you're alone.  Yeah.  We're just being silly.  Okay.  I'm just being nice to you.  You're being very nice to me.  Lisa, isn't it a little hot in studio?  Maybe you need to take the top off?  I don't know.  I'm just thinking.  I can.  Yeah.  Would you like?  Well, ask Pat.  Pat?  Would you like to see?  Sure.  What am I already looking at?  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, the whole rest of the package.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Sheesh.  Well.  Thanks.  I'm glad.  I don't even know why I bother wearing clothes anymore at all, though.  No, you shouldn't.  I try not to, but I think walking down the street might be difficult.  Hey, Lisa.  Yes, dear.  Could you maybe get Patty in on the action, I'm thinking?  What?  What?  Patty, do you want to suck a girl's tits?  No.  All right.  All right.  Want to taste the big nipple?  Big, juicy areola?  No.  Come on.  It'd be fun.  It's enough to watch.  How about this, Patty?  Don't suck it.  Just touch it. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Just.  Yeah.  Give it.  Here, will you touch it?  Just touch it.  Yeah, just squeeze it.  It's a real.  Come on.  It'll help the show.  Yeah, Patty, squeeze.  It's not like I'm going to be like, yeah.  Squeeze Lisa's Sparks.  Don't worry.  Just squeeze them.  They're very nice.  Yeah, she's not even into girls.  Patty, reach up.  Reach up and squeeze them.  Look at her.  She's like, oh my God.  For a goof and tell us what it feels like.  Patty, go ahead, Patty.  Don't be shy.  That's the fucking thing.  She'll do it.  She'll do it.  She's dirty.  It's just going to take her a minute.  Patty, touch it.  Go ahead.  I don't bite, I promise.  Patty.  Unless you ask me to. 
[02:51:00]  Jesus.  Lighten up, Patty.  Here you go, Patty.  I'll bring them closer.  Go ahead.  I'm embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed.  Go ahead.  That fat kid will put your cat in a garbage decision.  You know he wants to.  They feel like mine.  Only bigger.  Oh, wow.  Only bigger, firmer, younger.  What else?  Mine's a lot smaller.  We know.  All right, Patty.  Now, you did that. 
[02:51:30]  Now, just sucking on them is really the same thing.  No, no, no.  How about this, Patty?  I don't do the baby bottle.  Don't suck it.  How about this?  How about you peck it, but dry?  Yeah.  You don't give it a wet kiss.  It's enough to slap it.  Lisa, can you put a boob in Patty's face, please?  She really does.  Just kiss.  If I could.  Yeah.  Over to the side.  A kiss, Patty.  All right, Patty.  Turn around and kiss that big boobie.  Everybody's doing it.  Oh, my God.  She's literally an inch away from Lisa Sparks.  I don't do things like that.  Milk is good for your frail bones.  It is.  You need it. 
[02:52:00]  Patty.  Go ahead, Patty.  Just go ahead, Patty.  Patty, you know you want it.  Right here.  You don't even have it right here.  You don't have to get it wet.  Like a little peck.  Yeah, go ahead.  People on Pal Talk, one guy wants her to finger her fart box.  Wow.  Okay.  Patty, go ahead.  Give me a kiss.  Go ahead, Patty.  Don't go shy.  It's sexy.  But I don't go that way.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  She's not bisexual.  She's straight.  I've never done this in my life.  That's the beauty of it.  Patty, it's not gay if you're doing it for a radio show.  Exactly. 
[02:52:30]  Right.  Let's go.  The listeners.  Yeah, but I'm out of my mind.  Oh, it's okay, honey.  There you go.  I'll help you.  Oh, we got close.  I got close.  Patty's a lesbo.  She got close.  She's Patty.  Big dyke.  All right, let's get back to Patty.  Did you like it?  Patty's a dyke.  What's wrong, Patty?  I'm shocked.  Why?  Why?  I'm stalker dykey.  Patty, you're now a lesbian.  Yeah, what's the matter, Snatchmaker?  I know I'm not.  I'm still shocked.  Hey, hey, hey, clip breath. 
[02:53:00]  Did you enjoy doing that?  How was that rug chore?  All right, Patty, now you're going to finger Lisa Sparks.  How about this?  Patty, have you ever touched another vagina before?  Lisa, Patty is a 52-year-old version.  I will not.  She's a version.  I barely even touched my own.  Would you cup it?  Not put your fingers in it.  Like this.  Like, just cup it with your fingers together.  Watch.  I'll take the three panties.  I won't touch you first.  Just tap it.  Well, there's no fun if you're not going to touch it.  Just tap it like you're making sure the water's not too hot from a faucet. 
[02:53:30]  Just like that.  Like a gentle touch with your fingers.  You're not going to do anything.  Yeah.  I'll even leave my underwear on if it makes you feel special.  Yeah, sorry, Patty.  Get in there.  That might be best.  Okay, with the panties on, it's okay.  Why?  You calling her dirty or something?  Only one second, and then that's it.  No, just feel it.  Feel the lips.  Just feel it.  Feel it.  Feel it.  Okay.  Feel it.  Patty, it's not bad.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sheets of oils.  She's got hot plates.  Yeah.  Patty, you've got to cup it.  Yeah.  Put your hands under.  Kind of like this.  The way one would lift, like, if an animal is going to shit in your hand. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  That was a bad one.  That was a bad one.  By the way, our goal is to have a threesome.  Yeah.  Pat from it on.  Yeah.  Lisa Sparks.  I showered this morning, I swear.  She's sexy, Patty.  She's very cute.  Pretend it's a soap dispenser.  Just cup it.  Pretend it's a pair of balls.  All right, Patty.  Let's go.  Come on, Patty.  Get in there.  Just cup it.  Don't be shy.  All right.  All right.  She did it.  All right.  Very good.  But the underwear is on, though.  It's not the same thing.  It's like, you know.  You should take them off.  I don't care. 
[02:54:30]  I'll take them off.  I'll take them off.  Yeah, you should just look at her.  She has a nice pussy, Patty.  It's really sexy.  Patty, they're calling you Patty the Pussy Eater on Instant Feedback.  Patty the Prude.  Yeah.  All right.  Panties are coming off, Patty.  Yes, yes, yes.  Patty.  No.  If we put a glove on, will you stick one in?  No.  Now what are you trying to say?  She won't do it otherwise.  She gets panicky.  Patty, just look at it.  She's like a little over and beyond.  All right.  Tell us what it looks like, Patty.  You're right next to it.  It looks just like the one I have.  It looks just like Pat's.  I have the same thing, too. 
[02:55:00]  Hey, could you guys, how about, could you just, look at that little, it's so fat, Patty.  It is.  How do you not like that?  It's juicy.  Why don't you just, just touch it a little bit with your hand, like gently cup it.  Why do you want me to do that?  Because you've never done it, and you and I have had a lot of firsts together, so, yeah.  We've never hooked up, but we've had a lot of firsts together.  So just cup it.  Just touch it, Patty.  She's clean.  I mean, it's just sexy.  Touch it.  Just promise.  I just shouted this morning, I swear.  No, no, Patty, you're going to get to touch it.  Trust me, I'll be there in a minute. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Go ahead, Patty.  Just cup it.  Come on.  Close your eyes.  Do you want someone to put your hand on it gently?  And don't touch it like you're testing the iron if it's hot.  Jimmy, Jimmy's usually good at helping.  I just never do it.  Jimmy, get over there and help her.  I'll help.  Jimmy will help you.  Show her.  What do you mean?  Jimmy, it has a way of...  Patty, you pull your hand away so fast.  She did touch it.  No, she did.  She did touch it.  I held her hand, and she touched it.  Patty, would you leave your hand there for a second?  Jesus.  I'm going to make it, dude.  Come here.  Just get this over with. 
[02:56:00]  Yes, dear.  I'll show you how to do it.  Move your big afro to the left, you frigging...  Okay.  There you go.  Dear.  Patty's reading lips.  Patty, lean in.  Relax.  Jesus.  Just leave it.  Just leave your hand.  There you go.  What's going on, Jimmy?  Okay, Jimmy.  I wish we would bite one of our fingers off.  Right.  She touched it.  She had her hand on it for a couple of seconds.  Now lick your fingers.  You know Patty will do anything for money.  Oh, no.  Cash is king with Patty.  Oh, no. 
[02:56:30]  Patty, how much money do you need today?  We might have to watch that.  Well, they're taking away my TV and my couch.  You want a fan?  How about this?  Patty gets an on-the-stand oscillating fan to cool her and that fucking shitbox animal  of hers off.  If all you got to do is put on gloves, because she won't do it without gloves.  Okay.  And we'll show you how to...  No, no, no.  Don't.  Because she wouldn't...  She touched my penis, but she would do it with gloves on.  And you'd have to put a couple of fingers... 
[02:57:00]  You'd have to rub Lisa's vagina.  What's wrong, Patty?  You have gloves on.  It's for a fan, man.  You had a brand new oscillating fan.  Think of that animal.  Your animal's uncomfortable.  You're hurting your animal.  Patty, you don't have to give us the answer right now.  She looks like the Crypt Keeper when they canceled Tales from the Crypt.  All right, Patty, think about it.  Let's get back to Pat from Moukake here, there, Lisa.  Moukake, what?  That's what I thought I heard.  Sorry. 
[02:57:30]  Hey, if you want him to Moukake your face, then he'll be known as Pat from Moukake.  That would be...  Hey, I've been there, done that.  It's okay.  All right, cool.  All right, Pat.  Lisa, you want to go back down and see what's going on over there?  I can.  Here, I'm going to...  If you don't mind.  Take my clothes.  Please.  Make sure I get them back.  I know how you are.  You're like...  You're not close.  I'll hoard them.  Great hiney.  All right, we're back to Pat.  I'm all...  She's got the turd cutter of an angel.  Oh, fuck.  Yes, it's not bad. 
[02:58:00]  I don't know.  See, I have to come back down here.  We got it all messed up and...  Yeah.  They just distracted us.  Lisa, did we lose the progress?  Yeah, the spider got washed down.  Really?  Not about.  That's all right.  It should have after that.  It's all right.  It'll work.  Oh.  We'll get him to work.  What are you looking at, Patty?  Oh, hey.  Oh.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Oh, hey.  At least in front of Pat.  Reminds me of when I sit wrong in the van. 
[02:58:30]  On a hot day.  On a hot day?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh.  See, he's right back where I found him.  Pat, relax, man.  Hi, Sam.  How's that video camera doing?  Oh, hey.  How about this?  For one minute, Pat can't make any noises.  Or we could just listen to Pat for one minute.  We don't talk.  That could be good, too.  Okay.  It would really help.  Can you pull it down a little bit?  That would really help.  Well, sure. 
[02:59:00]  Just a little.  Let's give the floor to Pat and Lisa Sparks.  Oh, just a little.  A little bit.  Sparks.com, is it?  Yes, it is.  Sparks.  With three X's.  With three X's.  Like my designer underwear?  What are you wearing?  He had blue underwear on.  I was like, I told you.  I think Pat bought those underwear.  They're mood underwear.  Okay.  Enjoy, Pat.  Here we go.  Well, hi.  You deserve it.  Hi.  How are you?  I should have stirrups.  Put my feet up.  Okay.  Hi, Patty. 
[02:59:30]  How you doing?  I'm fine.  How are you?  Shut up.  I'm sure you're fine.  Shut up.  Well, hi.  What was that?  Okay.  Hello?  Well.  Hmm.  E-Rock, please stop talking.  Well.  Oh. 
[03:00:00]  Patty's laughing.  Call your doctor if you have an erection.  It lasts for four hours or longer.  Hello?  Hello?  I was worried I'd be humiliated today.  Okay.  Hi.  Hi.  Everything's good for you? 
[03:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Just checking.  Yeah.  Ew.  Well.  This is interesting.  I know.  She's kneeling between.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well.  Interesting how?  Uh.  Interesting.  I don't know.  I'm speechless.  She's simulating.  Oh, hey. 
[03:01:00]  Three-piece set.  Can't forget those.  Smirking the balls.  I was going to say, you can't forget the balls.  Yeah.  Well.  Idioms.  Shut up.  Okay.  Back her up.  Shut up.  Oh, well.  Okay.  Oh, you know.  Yeah.  Good.  You see how that's done?  Really?  Patty?  Now it's your turn.  You see how that's done, Patty?  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Yeah, but I don't think so. 
[03:01:30]  Dive right in there, Patty.  Thank you.  Lisa, how's it going?  Anything or is it still a little?  It's good.  I think if we were not in the middle of here, it would be better.  But yes, he's getting hard.  He's a little.  He'll fill up.  It's just.  I couldn't do it in front of all these people either.  Yeah.  So you're not supposed to almost.  It's not natural.  Exactly.  But this is kind of a warm up.  So in the room alone, it'll be relaxed.  Of course.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Why not just send him into the room then?  I agree.  Yeah.  Why don't we.  Yeah.  Give you some privacy. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  And we have to mic them.  But how about we give Pat a headset so he can hear.  Sure.  Or we just have somebody outside.  Uh-huh.  Private.  Shall I pull up my pants now?  Yes.  I really wanted to say that.  Otto.  Yeah.  What do you think?  What's your observations here?  It's just fascinating.  I think diabetes is a cruel disease.  Yeah.  But Pat Jersey, are you feeling good though?  Like she's sexy, man.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  Absolutely.  It feels nice, right?  Yeah.  Storkin' Patty was like trying to look directly into the sun and she kept diverting it.  Yeah.  Like she didn't want to be blinded or something.  What's the matter, Patty?  You didn't want to watch?  She wanted to watch.  You could tell.  But it's embarrassing.  Why is it embarrassing?  It's...  You know what?  Lisa, I don't know if you're into this, but Patty's specialty is the strap-on.  Okay, but I'm not into strap-ons. 
[03:03:00]  I understand.  That's why I was asking.  But I think that's cool.  I can't do them.  They always break whenever I try to use one.  That's why I don't like them.  Patty would put the strap-on on.  I know.  And take care of you.  I've got you.  I know what you mean, but no.  I'm not into women.  I like dicks so much, it's just ridiculous.  Wow.  Nice.  Ridiculous, huh?  Ridiculous.  You are a trooper.  All right, should we take a break and then get them in a...  I'm sorry, we get Pat a little privacy. 
[03:03:30]  We promised him some privacy, and we want to...  We don't want him to feel like he's performing.  You always feel like you have to perform.  You don't have to.  This is about you feeling good.  Patty...  You don't have to entertain anybody.  Pat, what do you think so far?  What do you think so far?  I think she's a very lovely and gorgeous woman.  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  Yeah?  You like her, right?  Oh, yeah.  She's fucking...  She's really hot, man.  Yeah.  Yay!  I like to hear that stuff.  Makes a woman feel good, doesn't it?  Well, Pat's great.  He's too shy.  He doesn't know how to relate to a sexual woman.  I think I have some intimacy issues. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  But I see...  I try to be really nice, so it doesn't...  Yeah.  So I don't make everybody all nervous.  Where does that come from there, Pat?  I don't know.  Maybe a little self-conscious.  I don't know if you've noticed this, but I'm a couple pounds overweight, and...  Lisa, does that bother you?  No, I was just going to say so.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, and then...  It all works the same, right?  It all works the same, and all kinds of things.  Diabetes doesn't help. 
[03:04:30]  And, uh, yeah.  Pat's the happy clown, right?  Yes!  Is your dick a wet noodle from diabetes?  I'm Wilford Brimley.  Get your medical supplies at Liberty, and get a splint for your cock.  Do you jerk off soft, Pat, like when it's soft?  Yeah!  Yeah, see, it's like addictive.  How many do you jerk off every day, right?  Addictive?  What?  You do it every day?  Yeah, pretty much.  Like, when I...  Sometimes, like, I'll be busy, and then it'll go a couple days, and I'll go, 
[03:05:00]  Hey, I didn't jerk off in a couple days, oh my god!  Then I'll make up for it.  Yeah.  That makes it harder to get a rod, too, when you jerk off too much,  because nothing else fucking feels good anymore.  It's just a matter of just doing something high, and not because it feels sexy.  It's like an early routine.  Yeah.  I know.  No.  I've fucking...  I've hurt my back at the computer.  You know, we didn't ask Pat.  What do you want to do to Lisa?  Oh.  Well.  Just, uh, you know, the usual.  Anything in particular, though? 
[03:05:30]  Uh, anything, uh, whatever she likes.  I like to please.  I'm a people pleaser.  So am I.  So we're going to have a lot of trouble, aren't we?  We're a lot of fun.  It'd be great.  Are we talking maybe switching places here?  Maybe, uh, Lisa sits in that seat for a second or two, Pat?  Oh.  Is that what you're going to get?  Oh, hey.  Okay.  I won't be sitting on her knees.  Great.  Lisa, you want to sit in the chair for a moment?  Sure, I can sit down.  All right, Pat, why don't you get up?  You got to take the underwear off then, huh?  Yeah, I would say.  All righty, uh, excuse me. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, how awkward.  How awkward.  How awkward.  Pat's just walking around with this.  I know.  Pull him up.  All right, pull up your pants, Pat.  Hold on.  Now Pat refuses to put his cock away.  He's just waving at everybody.  He's like a little fucking exhibitionist.  Yeah.  Well, you got Lisa Sparks in your chair.  He's got cute eyebrows.  Thank you.  Look at Patty just sitting there.  What are you doing?  All right, Pat, grab your mic and, uh, you know, do what you have to do. 
[03:06:30]  Can someone hold the mic?  Well, could you hold the mic?  Or Duff can hold the mic for him.  Okay.  All right.  Poor thing.  Oh, God.  Eenie, meenie, minie.  No.  Eenie, meenie, minie, no.  Eenie, meenie, minie.  Oh, hi.  Will.  Hi.  Will.  Oh, hi.  Meenie, minie, no.  I'm like, yes.  Okay.  Will.  Is that not what you were expecting?  Yeah.  Pat?  Hey.  Pat, what's going on?  Uh, well, I see a, uh, uh, a vagina in front of me. 
[03:07:00]  Go at it like Kobayashi.  Hey.  Okay.  Hello, a little man in the boat.  Okay.  Uh, may I?  Absolutely.  May I?  I don't want to be too forward.  I was just going to say how polite.  Who said you could do that?  May I?  Hi.  I'm all thank you for asking.  Hello.  Oh.  Thanks for asking.  Stop at the Bob Hope bit and do it. 
[03:07:30]  Still going for laughs.  Hello.  How do you do, Lisa?  What's he doing?  Uh, um.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Tell him what he's, is he doing it right or would you want any adjustments you might need made?  No, no, no.  He's perfect.  Cool.  Perfect.  He's got the tongue going on the clip, up and down and all around.  Oh, good.  Fantastic.  I know the alphabet.  He must have been reading up on the books.  I stopped painting the fence a long time ago.  Mmm. 
[03:08:00]  He thought, I almost wish I was gay.  Because passing on his hands and knees, I would love to rape him.  Yeah.  But is he doing pretty good?  Yeah, pretty good.  Gentle?  Yeah.  Very nice.  Did you have a cheeseburger for dinner last night?  Yeah.  I was doing that.  I was just going to say, but no.  Oh, that must have been me.  Oh, I burped.  I was like, no, I had no cheeseburger.  He's got to be the happy clown always.  I know.  It's like Tor Johnson bobbing for gonorrhea. 
[03:08:30]  Hey, hey, I have no gonorrhea.  Don't give me a complex.  What?  Huh?  Fucking odd.  Oh, no.  Yeah, don't give her a simplex.  We don't even have to bother later.  We don't even have to bother later.  Holy shit.  Does that conjure an image?  Oh, shit.  Hmm.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[03:09:00]  Ah.  Pat, how's it going?  It's cold and cold.  I really think somebody must have given him lessons.  Really?  Yeah, because it's not like people that don't know what they're doing.  Wow.  So.  Hmm.  That's a little thing.  I didn't even learn that.  Pat, how'd you learn that?  Yeah.  Uh. 
[03:09:30]  From my mom.  Hey.  Who's been talking?  Back to the pool vac.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hey, Pat, could you do an FH Riley's plug while you're down there?  400 New York games.  Huntington, New York.  There he is.  That tickles.  I was in the kitchen burning the steak at this point. 
[03:10:00]  Patty, please stop talking.  Yeah, Patty, have you ever seen this being done?  Not in real life.  Maybe on Channel 35 when I breezed past it on TV.  When you breezed past it.  Get out of here.  You watch that like the whore you are.  There's no commercials.  There's no real shows.  How do you notice a lot of your breathing pain?  Yeah, you're breezing.  She probably puts a little milk on her clit and the cat hops up.  I miss Red Shoe Diaries. 
[03:10:30]  I want that back.  I miss Red Shoe Diaries.  She really is dirty.  She really is a clit fumbler.  The church fucked her up.  Red Shoe Diaries is very soft compared to today, but I like it.  It had a plot and a story to look like.  All right, shut up.  Look at what's going on, Patty.  Patty, look at what's going on.  Give us the play-by-play.  I'm looking.  Stop.  I'm looking.  I'm licking. 
[03:11:00]  Lisa, what's going on?  You know what?  I'm enjoying myself.  It's hard to talk.  My brain shuts off.  Hey, Patty, can you do us a favor?  While Pat from Monaki does that, can you just squeeze Lisa Sparks' boobs, please?  But didn't I do it the first time?  Yeah, but now she really needs it.  Why?  But I did it right.  Why?  If you don't do this, you won't be allowed to do Ron and Fez's show anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Oh, shit.  This is not something I'd do.  All right, just.  All right.  It feels like mine.  Only mine are much smaller.  We kind of got a threesome going on right now.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Patty, get in there and do the right thing for the show for once.  Oh, unsensual.  By the way, I got an email.  I got a text from a friend of mine, Patty, if you're a team player today.  If old Antwoman wants an AC, I will get her one or a fan.  That's if.  How many BTUs?  That's if.  Three. 
[03:12:00]  I don't know what BTU is.  That's British thermal units.  That's if we're, you know, impressed by her appearance.  That's right.  What are you grabbing at a tits for like you're falling off a bridge and then the only thing's holding you?  Touch them nicely.  I'm doing what you told me.  Touch them like you'd let yours touch you, old Dyke.  I don't know how to do that.  Watch Lisa.  Lisa's doing it.  I can't give you an example.  Lisa's doing it with her other boom.  But you're making a fist.  This is so hard.  Patty, just squeeze them harder.  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  I can't.  I swear it's not too hard.  She likes to squeeze them.  I do.  Squeeze them hard, Patty.  That's what she likes.  It's okay.  I am squeezing.  Oh, you're pinching.  You're not our aunt.  Keep squeezing.  Yeah.  I'm taking a breather.  He's doing good.  I saw Pat take a breather.  I'm like, quit moving your head.  Pat, you're not going to pass out, are you?  I can just snorkel right about now.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  You want a beverage?  I had this done for about three hours last night, so I can't do something like that.  Okay.  I'm feeling special.  I'm feeling special.  Something ridiculous like that.  Fuck it, Pat.  I'm sorry.  You are special.  Oh.  She's rubbing his head a little bit.  You are special.  Hmm.  Yeah, I know. 
[03:13:30]  I went on one of those short yellow buses.  I'm glad I could watch this on camera so I don't have to really look at it.  Watch you all watch it and turn into pillars of salt.  Yeah.  We might have to take a break and get these two in a private room.  I was just going to say.  Yeah.  I'm ready to suck his dick already.  All right.  When she laughs, she pink socks into my mouth.  Holy shit, Pat. 
[03:14:00]  Pink socks.  Oh, God.  Hey, Pat, maybe a little...  Pat.  Yes, Opie?  Turn around for a sec.  He was giving you the two-finger notice.  Little shocker.  I'll just stay here.  What?  Oh.  Do a combination platter.  One in the pink and two in the stink, as they say.  Let her walk you through it.  What she likes.  Okay.  These two?  You can do the front.  It doesn't matter.  These two. 
[03:14:30]  It doesn't matter as long as you hit the little thing on the top.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  I'm patting.  Oh, my God.  Just watch, Patty.  What's wrong with you?  It's nature.  I just saw it.  Oh, my God.  She can't look away, though.  Wow.  Patty's a dirty girl.  Oh, my God.  Stupid church fucked her up.  I don't have to look.  Silk stockings had a bit of plot.  Wait till he pulls out a catfish.  Hey, somebody just cut me off. 
[03:15:00]  I'm giving him a finger.  Oh, God.  We're not exactly in traffic.  Pat's doing some noodling right now.  Yeah.  I think I caught something.  Yeah, I think you did, too.  You don't have to move the chair.  I see it.  Look at that, Patty.  What do you think?  Don't you see me turning red?  No.  No one's looking at you.  I feel like a lobster right now.  Like to throw you in a pot of hot water. 
[03:15:30]  Probably.  I just came out of the hot water.  That's what I look like.  Oh, shit.  It's almost mind-boggling how bad your improv skills are.  I just came out of the hot water.  Pat, what's going on?  I'm looking for a rabbit to pull out.  Oh, come on.  You're too close.  Too close.  Stop.  Yes!  You're too close.  Lisa, how's it going? 
[03:16:00]  It's going fantastic.  Is he doing the come here move?  He hasn't quite got the fingers turned the right way to do the come here move yet.  Oh, no.  What's he doing?  He's just jabbing around in there.  Pat.  Yes?  You got to do the come here.  Come here.  And it's close towards the front.  Yeah.  Yeah, mine's close towards the front.  Yeah.  Just dig around like you're greasing a bearing.  If nice fittings.  Like lug nuts.  She could possibly be the worst at improv ever. 
[03:16:30]  Patty's improv is fucking, it's abominable on a human level.  Yeah, it's just horrid.  Pat, how's that going for you?  It's perfect.  This is where I'm looking for change in a couch.  I think I found some quarters.  Patty, anything?  I get an education.  I mean, I've only seen this on channel 35.  Your improv skills.  You know, and then I move on. 
[03:17:00]  Patty, your improv skills are the aids of improv skills.  Yeah.  It's just that I feel it's weird.  It's not weird.  Do you know if I'm featuring her damaging her insides?  You are.  It's a good thing, I promise.  Oh, thank you.  What do you got going on over there, guys?  He's got the spot.  Yeah?  Oh, he did.  That'll only take about a second from now.  Oh, okay.  Patty, what do you think?  He's hitting the spot. 
[03:17:30]  Educational.  Okay.  Oh, Pat, keep going, that means.  I don't know.  That's it.  Wow.  What happened?  I'm sorry.  I don't come loud.  Wow, you got her.  You hit the fucking spot, Pat.  You did.  I graduated come loud.  I'm like, I'm like.  I don't.  I don't hear that.  Excuse me?  I don't hear that.  Let's do it for Pat from the night.  Yeah.  That was great. 
[03:18:00]  Otto, anything?  A cunning linguist, as they say.  The pullback was great.  Yeah.  Patty, what did you think?  Oh, my God.  Educational.  All right.  I just never saw it up close and in person.  All right.  You're next.  No.  No?  Yeah, you're next.  No.  Patty, did you see how easy that was?  When I'm breezing.  Want to smell my fingers, Patty?  Yeah, smell Pat's fingers.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Look at that, Patty.  Look, look, look.  She's cleaning her fingers.  Oh, my God. 
[03:18:30]  I taste good.  Patty, smell Pat's fingers, please.  Yes.  Come on.  I have zero smell.  I am very clean.  Patty, look up.  Just a quick sniff.  We want to hear the sniff on radio.  It's like a Starbucks trout latte.  I smell it.  I was figuring my asshole an hour ago.  Trout latte.  I just put my son two inches away from my eyes.  Did you smell it?  Yeah, I guess I did. 
[03:19:00]  What did you smell?  What did it smell like?  I can't describe it.  It smelled sour.  Clam's Casino.  Sour.  Clam's Casino.  It smells a little too close for comfort.  It smelled sour?  I was going to say, my vagina does not smell sour.  I don't have any adjectives.  Lisa, you can take one of those boobs and smack her in the face for that.  I know that it doesn't smell sour.  Of course not.  I don't know how to describe it. 
[03:19:30]  All right.  So, Patty, what did you think of a finger like that in there, huh?  Yeah.  I never saw that in person.  Would you ever let anyone do that, Patty?  No.  Why?  Not unless I was with somebody for more than six months and that was my only love.  Then it would be out of love.  Love.  Because that's how I am.  I can't help it.  You want to finger yourself then?  Why?  I bet your box is nice and tight, Patty.  Why would she want to implicate herself in a crime?  I know.  Let me tell you something.  I go as far as the mechanical thing you gave me last year. 
[03:20:00]  I'm a motherfucker.  But that's as far as I go.  I mean, that's tearing us up.  He's hysterical.  He's fucking hysterical.  All right.  Now what do we got going on?  We want to take a break and set up for...  Yeah, we'll take a break.  We'll put them in the room where they can be a little alone.  Get alone time.  And Lisa...  Pat's turn.  Pat got the job done?  He did.  I'm just not really loud.  When I do it in the movies, it has to be super over loud.  Yeah.  But at home, no, I'm not loud. 
[03:20:30]  I'm like, no, no, no.  It's good.  All right.  It's Lisa Sparks with 3Xs.com.  Thank you.  Otto from Otto and George playing House of Blues.  Yeah.  July 5th.  Down there in Atlantic City.  Yep.  We'll continue.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Testing supplies.  What would your chick name be if you were a tranny or just a transvestite? 
[03:21:00]  You like dressing up as a woman and going out at night?  What would you pick as your chick name?  E-Rock.  Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  Hello.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:21:30]  Some great, great instant feedback coming in really fast.  Um, Mustang Rob, Pat Chog, he writes, uh, aha, after Pat ate her box for 15 minutes, we  immediately get a commercial for erectile dysfunction.  Priceless.  And then Thomas Overbeck doing his, uh, Susan Waldman impression.  Goodness gracious, Pat from Monarchia is in Lisa Sparks' box.  Blocks. 
[03:22:00]  And what, Pat Duffy's head was in the way for the pal talkers I'm hearing?  That blows.  Pat Duffy's a large-headed man.  That happens.  He has a big James Hetfield head.  Where's, uh, where's the happy couple?  They're ready to go in.  What do I do?  Tell them to go in.  Pat?  What mic needs to be on?  This one.  Hey, Pat?  Pat?  Yes?  How you doing, buddy?  Oh, there you are. 
[03:22:30]  All right.  I saw you ran into the bathroom with the boys.  Yeah, I just thought maybe I'd rinse off my two fingers.  So, did it feel good when she was giving your head?  I'd love to get my dick stuck from her.  Uh, yes.  That was lovely.  It would be more lovely if I could, you know.  You might be able to.  You can jerk off.  Maybe.  How about this?  If it's going bad, whatever.  You can't.  So, just, you could always whack your own bag into her mouth.  She'd like, she'd probably like that.  Well, there you go.  Yeah, it sounds something a lady would like. 
[03:23:00]  She would, man.  Pat goes into the bathroom.  She's a pervert.  I go to Pat.  What are you doing?  He goes, I need to get the candy shell off my fingers.  Candy shell.  Yeah.  So, why don't you guys, should they go in there?  Yeah, absolutely, Jimmy.  Do we have a wireless mic hooked up?  Yeah.  What was I going to say?  Something else about Pat.  Oh, someone gave you a compliment.  They said, you're the only guy that could do stand-up while you're on your knees. 
[03:23:30]  Oh.  That's a compliment.  That's kind of funny.  Yeah.  All right, Pat.  Lisa's waiting for you.  Work the San Francisco club.  What?  On my knee.  Never mind.  All right.  Yeah, I stink.  No, you don't.  You don't stink.  Lisa, having fun?  Thumbs up.  All right, she's out.  Somewhere?  Lisa Petty's going to watch your band.  Are we following Danny?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Hey, Danny, make sure the volume's off in that Ron and Fez room.  I think the only stipulation here is it's Pat and Lisa Sparks in a room, and I think 
[03:24:00]  Patty has to be in there.  I think she has to.  And no one else.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  We kind of want Pat today.  Let's try it, and then if it really sucks, we'll get her out of there.  Patty!  She'll kill the rude.  What?  Oh, she will.  You want to start with that or no?  What is it?  We should start with that.  I think we should start with it, just because she's horrified.  How come you're being so nice to Pat from Munaki?  Is it just like...  We love the guy, yeah.  He hasn't blown a load.  Right. 
[03:24:30]  He hasn't blown a load in years.  But it's not an occasion or anything?  We just feel sorry for the guy.  Yeah.  He's a sweet guy.  No, we love Pat.  He's a really funny guy.  He's fucking one of the fastest guns in the West.  Extremely funny.  Get Patty in there, Erock.  Patty, you got to go in there with them.  Thanks for the pity, guys.  I love the pity.  I already heard that, Pat.  I'm sorry.  We should turn the volume down in there so they don't have to hear us bantering and joking.  Yeah.  I'm going to Pat to fucking blow a load, man.  I'll just assume cruel things are being said.  No.  Do we want to see just our fucking scenes? 
[03:25:00]  Cruel things.  Pat and Lisa, they're on the other side of the floor here.  Why is Patty here?  Why is Patty here?  I said I had to come and observe.  It was a threesome.  It's going to be a gruesome.  A gruesome.  A gruesome.  By the way, before they get started, my brother had horrific surgery yesterday, and we just  wanted to give him get well wishes.  My brother, Brett, who owns FH Riley's, he had trouble breathing and sleeping, so check 
[03:25:30]  this out.  He had to get his tonsils out.  He's way too old to get his tonsils out.  And then that punching bag on the back of his throat had to be shaved down a little bit.  All to open up airwaves.  Then I think he had to have his jaw shaved down a little bit.  Wow.  And then he had his nose rebroken because he's only breathing out of one nostril.  He's in hell right now.  That hurts.  I'm sure he's listening to the show, so get well wishes for Brett.  Get well, man. 
[03:26:00]  A mess.  Probably a better time to well wish.  In between.  Not that you don't want to well wish, but we could have done that on K-Rock when it was  civil.  But now it's like, we got Patty, she's going to watch Pat get his dick sucked by a porn  star.  By the way, Brett, Godspeed.  Listen to something you're not going to be doing for a long time.  Yeah.  Fuck.  That sounds like hell, though.  Oh, yeah.  Is he hospitalized?  No, I think it was, you know, surgery, yeah.  He's at home just miserable. 
[03:26:30]  I want to know who the best, like, nose surgeon in Manhattan is for me to get my sinuses.  Joe.  Who?  Joe.  Joe?  Yeah, he's the best, by the way.  This is a guy named Joe?  What's wrong with your nose?  I've been congested my whole life.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, Lisa.  They can't hear you.  They can't hear you now.  E-Rock, take care of this.  Yeah.  It's hard to hear anything in here.  I think we should be able to hear, because we're not, we're just going to kind of listen  and help you out.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, Lisa, the floor is yours.  Okay.  So, you can just kind of talk your way through whatever's going on there. 
[03:27:00]  Okay, well, I'm going to lay him down, because since there's a nice little couch,  I think it'll be better.  Yes.  I think I might get him to cum faster that way.  Come, I'm already here.  Lay down.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  Someone's suggesting Jimmy Ted, the nose expert, would help you out.  You ever suck a guy's cock?  I'm already here.  Uncomfortable.  A couple of very beautiful girls, huh?  Hi.  Where were you tonight?  The Kit Kat Club? 
[03:27:30]  All right.  I'm going to take his pants off real quick.  All right.  Yeah, why are you wearing my pants?  Smirr.  God.  Just go in quicker.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  That is something.  Okay.  Ooh.  Ooh, it's a cold couch.  Ooh.  We'll be cold for long.  We're going to tell you.  Cold weather.  Oh.  Stop staring, Patty.  I'm not looking.  Neither.  Well. 
[03:28:00]  Whoa.  Hmm.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well.  It really is going to be hard to talk with a dick in my mouth.  Not his.  Hi, Pat.  Hi, Ope.  What is Patty doing?  Hi, Ope.  She's staring intently at my balls.  Oh, God. 
[03:28:30]  That's shockily.  Good.  What a fucking visual.  What, Patty?  What did you say?  I don't know.  She's staring.  Jimmy's on to a whole different thing.  But she's.  Her awful impression?  You're just kicking enough.  All I want to hear.  Yeah.  I know, man.  Yeah.  Hey, Pat.  I think you've listened to this show for a while now.  You know, you've got to help us out here.  We can't do the heavy lifting now. 
[03:29:00]  Okay.  I can't call you, so you'll have to call me.  Uh, well, she's, uh, sucking on my cock.  And Patty's doing what?  She's, uh, she's got her hands between her legs.  And she's rocking back and forth.  Patty, what are you doing down there, Patty? 
[03:29:30]  I'm in shock.  Lisa looks like she's in very much agreement with something.  Her head's going up and down, up and down.  Yes, yes, I know.  She's bobbing for apples.  I'm on the same trip as Jimmy now.  Wait, Patty.  Patty, what did you say?  How's it going?  What, Patty?  She's bobbing for apples.  She was so bad.  There's not a funny bone in her body. 
[03:30:00]  Or even, it's just nothing.  She could just be saying beverages or something.  Yeah.  Stupid delivery.  Oh, is she terrible?  Yeah.  Lisa!  Yeah?  How's it going?  It's fantastic.  Okay.  I'm getting them there.  I'm getting them there.  In about a month, I'll have a real big erection.  Wait a minute.  That makes it sound bad, like I'm not good.  No.  As I said before, it's not you.  It's me. 
[03:30:30]  Stop quipping, Pat.  You can blow a loader mouth.  You can quip later.  Yeah.  Hey, Patty, what does it look like she's doing?  Well, she's bobbing for them apples there.  Yeah, we've heard that.  That's a euphemism.  Oh.  That taint right.  Taint itself?  Yeah.  Oh, you know you like the balls lick. 
[03:31:00]  She just said the same thing four times in a row.  So, Patty, is she working as taint?  Um, I didn't think guys had taints.  Oh, what do you think?  Well, guys got assholes and they got genitals.  Yeah.  There's got to be something in between there.  What do you think we call that?  Yeah.  Patty, you got to help us out.  What's going on?  The eagle has landed.  What does that mean, Patty? 
[03:31:30]  What's going to come out when he comes out of his genital?  When he comes?  Yeah, what's going to come out?  Uh, you know, stuff.  From the apples?  Groceries?  What?  Fluffer nutters.  Um.  Um.  The usual.  All right.  Do you know what it looks like, Patty?  Oh, on TV.  But on channel 35. 
[03:32:00]  And then we'll be forced to switch to the channel.  Yeah, we know channel 35.  Yeah.  To watch Animal Planet.  But you've watched, uh, to completion.  Uh, Trevor.  Trevor writes.  Uh.  Trevor writes.  You guys should get Pat to bang Patty.  Then she'll have at least one funny bone in her body.  That's good.  Pat, how's it going?  Yeah.  Those fire alarms aren't helping.  There's fire alarms going off? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, it's getting very hot.  Oh.  What's getting hot, Patty?  How are you getting hot?  Oh, the air.  Oh, I thought you meant what you were watching is hot.  You know.  Well, it did go up a few degrees in here.  Gosh.  Terrible.  Right now it's about 45 degrees.  45.  Oh, I was thinking it was past 80.  Oh.  Oh, gosh.  She didn't even get the pat. 
[03:33:00]  The pat humor.  The fucking degrees joke.  She just.  Angles.  Angles, Patty.  She lives in the world of literal.  Yeah.  Angles.  Get out of the world of literal.  You'll.  Yeah.  You'll live a little bit.  Yeah.  Oh, maybe it's 90 degrees in here.  Oh.  480 if you're in a straight line.  Shut up.  Maybe 360 if you're in a circle.  Pat should fucking just shoot his wad in her mouth and then she should just grab Patty 
[03:33:30]  and open mouth kiss her.  Yeah.  And just pour his jizz right into Patty's mouth.  Patty, you ever get shot in the face with a super soaker?  No.  Well, yeah, I have been.  Full of yogurt.  Patty, we're going to play Spider-Man with you in a little while.  We're going to be playing some Spider-Man.  What's Spider-Man?  So you get hit with the web.  Yeah.  No.  We're going to be slinging some webs at you.  No.  We won't go there. 
[03:34:00]  Jimmy, you take a look.  Yeah.  I can only see Pat's kind of back towards me and her sort of sexy Lisa's head bouncing  up and down.  Good work.  Pat, anything?  Uh.  I have a feeling this is going to end with an apology from me.  Oh, my God.  Hey, wait a minute.  I was going to think if that's the case, it's going to be two days in a row and I'm going  to be very disappointed.  Hey, how about this?  How about this?  Hey, is Patty killing you, Pat?  Uh, yeah.  We'll go with that. 
[03:34:30]  How about this?  She ain't helping.  Let's put it that way.  Why don't we send, bring Patty in here for a few minutes.  Just see if they can get anything going.  Sure.  Leave Pat's mic on, but turn the volume down so they can't hear us.  So it really is just them.  Okay.  Yeah.  Let's just see if it works.  Yeah.  There you go.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, Patty.  Pat.  Pat.  Yeah?  Yeah, we're going to turn, we need you to talk because we're not going to be able to  communicate with you.  So you just, uh.  We'll hear you.  You won't hear us.  Yeah, all right?  Okay.  And we're going to, we're going to bring, uh, fucking, uh, cancer patient diaper out of 
[03:35:00]  there.  Yeah.  There's Patty.  Come on in, Patty.  Man.  All right.  Now they're alone in there.  Yeah.  So they won't know that they'll be talking over us or whatever.  Yeah.  Naturally.  Yeah.  They can't hear us.  Right.  I think this is pretty nice of us.  Yeah.  I mean, why not?  The guy's done a lot of good things.  All right.  That's much better.  There you go.  That'll help.  Patty, get a mic.  Sit down.  You're welcome.  I'll get the mic. 
[03:35:30]  I don't think he's able to just shut up and enjoy himself.  Yeah.  He's too eager for his show business career.  No, he just wants to perform.  He wants to please.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to be boring.  Yeah.  Well, she certainly knows what she's doing.  I'll bet you that it's fucking, uh.  He's a dipshit.  Just fucking blow already.  He's a dipshit.  Holy fuck.  Patty, this is some real hardcore, uh.  Hold on.  Get the mic here.  You actually.  Ooh. 
[03:36:00]  Well, she's certainly picking up the pace.  Pat can't hear us right now.  No.  No.  So we're not going to be, uh, buzzkill at this point.  Patty, what'd you think of that?  Pretty racy, huh?  Yeah, I never saw anything like it.  No, I didn't think you did.  No.  Would you do that if you were in love?  See, I don't know.  I've had crushes on people, but I've never. 
[03:36:30]  I'm going to nickname her Dyson because she has, uh.  I've never.  Some extra suction power.  You know.  You know, I've gone on dates, but never had a steady guy.  We gotta get your headphones, Pat.  If you hear Pat talking because he can't hear us.  You gotta shut up.  Yeah, just stop talking.  If you hear him chime in.  We've only known you 10 years.  Yeah.  Just shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I bet you she's sucking it. 
[03:37:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Boy, this is certainly better than doing deliveries.  What do you think, Patty?  Is he going to deliver something to Lisa?  I guess.  I don't know.  Oh, God damn it. 
[03:37:30]  Devoid of any humor.  Or improv skills.  It's funny.  He's bobbing for babies.  I hope not.  Are you a very religious woman, Patty?  Yeah, we got into this, Otto.  Yeah.  The church fucked her up.  Oh, yeah.  She wants to be dirty.  It's very obvious to us.  She'll pretty much do anything for us.  The sins of the flesh.  Yeah.  It's too bad.  You missed the whole, uh. 
[03:38:00]  Well, she certainly is a trooper.  It's like a ten-mile hike.  You're a sucker.  Yeah.  So, Patty, would you ever do that to a guy?  I don't know.  She's in there bobbing for apples.  She just can't, she can't come up with anything. 
[03:38:30]  Patty, what did you think of, uh, pats balls?  Bounce a ball.  Oh, fuck.  What is that?  I think somebody's trying to pick the luck.  Is that one by that door?  No one's by that door. 
[03:39:00]  No one's by the door.  No one's by the door.  Uh, Matt in North Carolina writes,  Patty's like the dog at the end of your bed  watching you and your girl fuck.  All confused.  Except not as quick-witted.  Not willing to come up and lick your balls.  Aren't you glad I trimmed my hair?  He just is a chatty Kathy. 
[03:39:30]  He won't shut up and shoot his load.  Just tell her you love her, Pat.  That's what you want to say.  Oh, yeah.  I love you.  What are you saying?  Me, you, the trailer at the end of the runway at Teterboro?  Yeah, this is going to end with an awkward exchange  where Pat invites her out to dinner or something.  Out to dinner?  You know.  Since I couldn't come, I could buy some clam chowder.  I'm going to count to ten,  and if you can come in ten seconds,  future porno's done. 
[03:40:00]  Okay.  Ready?  Well, you count to ten, because I'm sorry.  You like Sizzler?  Two, four, six, eight, ten.  Oh, he's got a future porno, and I'm going for it.  Well.  Listen to him.  Thank you.  You're so welcome.  Poor Pat.  Well. 
[03:40:30]  Thank you, because not only did you get yours, I got mine.  Wait, wait.  I don't know whose orgasm was worse.  Was that stupid last giggle, him coming?  I think my monkey gets too old for that, huh?  Yeah.  Getting up and down.  Maybe we should have got Pat of Viagra.  Was that happening, though, didn't he?  Did he fucking finish or what?  I don't know.  We're going to find out.  I don't know.  Patty, what do you think?  Did he shoot splooge?  I don't know what it really sounds like.  It sounds, I guess, the way they're talking, maybe. 
[03:41:00]  Thank you, dear.  Okay.  Thanks.  Okay.  They're kissing?  Thank you.  What are you talking about?  Thank you.  Wait, the awkward talk.  Yeah.  Let's see what Pat's got.  I'm sure I know.  He's asking for your number.  Yeah, we have your number.  She's like, email me from the website.  Did you lock us in?  Someone open the door for them, please.  Well. 
[03:41:30]  Push.  Open.  What, do we think she was going to run out?  All right.  Here comes Lisa's box in the studio.  We'll see if he can walk now.  Right.  Patty.  What does that mean, Patty?  Look at her.  Patty.  You're not supposed to be able to walk right after sex.  What is it?  It's sex, not polio, you dummy.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  He came so fast when I was sucking his dick.  We just didn't quite get that far. 
[03:42:00]  Can't help it.  Wait, what happened?  Pat.  He came while I was sucking on it, so.  Yeah.  Pat.  Maybe I have a cigarette?  Did you really blow your load?  I think like a little, I had a little reaction there.  There's a little bit there.  Not quite as forceful as I would like it to be, but.  But let me ask you, was it, would a Viagra have helped, like, relax you if your dick  was fully hard?  Would that have helped you?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  Well, next time we'll do that, because Danny had asked me, but I don't have any. 
[03:42:30]  And I also would talk to Dr. C before giving a diabetic anything.  No.  But if that's acceptable and healthy for him, we should fucking, you know, give him a Viagra  next time, because that would relax you.  You wouldn't feel self-conscious.  Well, actually, to give myself a little plug, I'm going to be on Dr. Steve's show Saturday  night.  Oh.  He asked me to be on.  Wow.  Maybe I'll consult with the doctor.  Yeah.  And also, I'm going to be on the fake radio show with Mongo, the trucker, and Struff. 
[03:43:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  So, people are, I'm in high demand.  Real blowjob day day, huh, Patty?  It is definitely a first.  I didn't make you jealous, did I?  No.  Shocked.  Oh my God, that's the worst.  So, Pat, what do you think?  Well, uh...  Who's your best pals?  Ah.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony and Lil' Jimmy. 
[03:43:30]  And Lisa.  Fuck us.  And Lisa.  Oh yeah, fuck you guys.  Lisa.  Was it awkward when the whole thing was done?  Uh, yeah.  It was like, uh...  Oh, I don't think so.  Hi.  And get your last name.  I gave him a hug and, you know...  And a kiss.  Could you lay in bed with her and just...  I would have liked to cuddled.  Would you?  Yeah.  We know you would have.  Pat likes to cuddle.  He'd rather cuddle than have any of that other stuff.  Okay.  By the way...  I'm normally like, just get out of my bed now, I'm done.  By the way, uh...  Pat from Wiennake's Cum Load brought to you by 5-Hour Energy, um... 
[03:44:00]  I only needed 5 minutes of that 5-Hour Energy.  You didn't need the whole 5-Hour Energy, right?  You still got 4 hours and 15 minutes of energy left.  5-Hour Energy, that's what we give the fans on the bleachers, and they're enjoying the  hell out of the stuff.  It doesn't make you crash or make you jittery.  There's no sugar in it, either.  No sugar makes you good, man.  Gives you the energy without the crash and the jittery-ness.  Alright.  We signless Pat.  Look at him.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  That's, uh...  He's done.  Uh, John from Fall River writes,  Sounds like Lisa sucked the diabetes right out of Pat.  Ooh.  Maybe.  Go to the doctor and find out.  I'll have to check my blue clothes meter.  Exactly.  Because if...  Blue clothes.  Because if that was true, then I want to know.  So, Patty, it looks like she, um...  Yeah.  Fucking sucked the sickness right out of him.  What do you think?  Maybe.  Mm-hmm.  Do you think he's cured?  I think we found the cure for diabetes. 
[03:45:00]  You want to roll.  You want to roll.  It's my new favorite thing.  Patty's complete lack of improv skills.  Line of the day is sponsored by...  Carbonite.com.

[03:45:30]  Promo code XM.  Patty, why folding your arms?  No, I always do.  I'm comfortable that way.  Polish bra?  No.  Polish bra?  I've never heard that before.  He's fucked up.  What do you think, Patty?  Polish bra?  Yeah.  I don't know what a Polish bra is.  That's where dyslexic poles go to drink.  Oh.  I'm not dyslexic.  Polish bra?  Never mind.  I'm not dyslexic. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  Patty, you're sitting there.  Patty?  You're stiff, man.  Waiting for you to say something, Patty.  Come on, you're ruining the show.  What do you got?  You want your fart box fingered?  What do you want from us?  I'm speechless.  Yeah, how about we give you a butt a good finger?  Finger for a fan.  What do you say?  What do you think about that?  A finger up a butt?  No, I can't do that.  How about you finger mine?  That's weird.  Yeah, no. 
[03:46:30]  That's something I don't dare do.  Why don't you stick a finger up Jimmy's butt?  Oh, no.  Put a glove on.  Get a glove on.  Why not?  What, are you a communist?  Get a glove on.  I'm not like that.  Put a glove on.  I'm not that kind of a person.  What, a fun one?  Come on, get a glove on.  You'll lube it up and just shove it in there.  No, I can't do that.  Do you mean we'll lick it off?  I bet I will.  It's not even my finger.  I'm not into that, but her, I would let her.  All right, Patty.  Oh, yeah.  For a fan. 
[03:47:00]  I think it's fair.  With a glove on, it's nothing.  You're not even really doing it.  Yeah.  Iraq, give her the glove.  Give her the glove, Iraq.  She'll do it.  I never did that before in my life.  That's the beauty of it.  She'll grab that glove off.  There's plenty of things you never did before until you did them, dummy.  You don't make a person happy.  This will be the first.  Yeah, but I don't do things like that.  She puts her hand in the glove.  She says that.  That's the beauty of Patty.  She wants to be so dirty.  No, you're putting a glove on me, but I don't do things like that.  All right, bring the lube.  I've never...  No! 
[03:47:30]  What do people think of me?  Lube.  I don't think that you're an assfinger or so like...  Lube, noobie.  You're sticking a finger up Jimmy's fart box.  We need a big finish.  You don't leave the lube.  You need some...  Just some good spit's good enough.  Yeah, why don't you spit on that finger, Patty?  No.  I trust the lube more than that.  Oh, geez.  Come on, it'll squash that lesbian rumor that's going around now.  No, it's just something I never do.  We got it.  Patty, get up.  We understand where you are so I can get my asses down.  Yeah, get up.  I can't believe this. 
[03:48:00]  Patty, which finger?  Oh, wow, I get a front row seat.  I'm so embarrassed.  She's doing the fake gun pose with the finger as she says.  I can't believe this.  She wants to do this so bad.  No, I don't.  Here is a runner-up line of the day as we get ready for Jimmy and Patty's thing here.  And now he called out sick today, right?  Is that true saying?  Are we calling clear for work?  Hey, we ever get cream pie Jones?  No.  To call in?  What the fuck, man?  All right, put some lube on her finger there, Erock. 
[03:48:30]  Bring a mic over here for her now.  Erock, please.  Erock, come back, Pai.  Lube up.  Not too much.  Come on.  Okay.  I just want to check out the front.  See?  I'm all...  I'm not going to take it out.  Oh, jeez.  Come here.  Come on, Patti.  No fair.  Just a little bit.  Patti, what's going on over there?  What's going on, Patti?  I'm nervous.  Me too.  All right.  Erock's... 
[03:49:00]  What is Erock doing?  He's putting the stuff on my finger.  Don't go in far.  I can't take much.  How about maybe Pinky?  I can prefer Pinky.  I can't take...  She has big fucking talons.  Hey, Velociraptor hands.  How about just...  And cold piano hands.  Hey, wait a minute.  Didn't I hear you say something at the Avian Awards that you like it up there?  Wow, you remember that.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Why don't you keep that on the QT?  Keep that on the DL.  He's being cross-examined. 
[03:49:30]  Too late.  It's already on Playboy TV.  All right, Patti.  He's Pichy Cooley.  All right.  What?  You're Pichy Cooley.  What the fuck are you saying?  Say it again.  I didn't hear it.  It's your behind.  I call it a Pichy Cooley.  I hate that.  Holy shit.  You're a Pichy Cooley head.  Jimmy and Patti have always had this weird thing over the years.  I don't know what to call it.  I'm a sweet boy and she's a whore.  I know, Patti. 
[03:50:00]  I'm joking.  Just rub your finger in between my butt crack.  Get the mic or mouth, too.  All right.  With the mic.  Hey, Patti, got anything over there?  Yeah, I got a thing over there.  I got nothing.  Okay.  I just rub it on my...  Okay, rub it in my butt crack, but gently.  Don't go hard.  Where the asshole is, not fucking up top.  That's my spine, you idiot.  Oh, my God.  What's he, a gazelle?  Hey, Patti.  What are you doing?  We're not taking bone marrow.  Fucking...  Oh, my God. 
[03:50:30]  I'm practically giving him a prostrate exam.  Prostrate.  What's a prostrate exam?  Patti's trying to do a spinal tap.  Patti, you got to go lower.  You're fucking...  You're touching the top.  That's...  Get to my asshole, would you, rookie?  I don't know where it is.  Here, it's right down here.  I don't believe you did that. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That mic's shot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's going...  That's got to go in the trash now.  Fucking Jimmy, I knew you were going for that.  Very good.  Let's do another runner-up line of the day.  And Lars smiled and did the hand motion.  I wanted to throw Louie off the balcony in jealous rage.  Right in the middle of playing.  No, it's like looking at a...  It's like you're looking at a $5 bill and Lincoln, like, winks and does a little funny... 
[03:51:30]  Kyle Hazard.  All right, next runner-up line of the day.  He used to date Lisa Lampanelli, I'm sure.  Oh, my God.  I forgot he used to date her.  White guy?  Disgusting thought that is.  Wow.  Disgusting.  Yeah.  How bad did he need coke? 
[03:52:00]  Otto, House of Blues, Showboat, Atlantic City, July 5th, OttoandGeorge.com.  Otto killed today.  Good job today, Otto.  You killed, thank you.  Next runner-up line of the day.  I remember being in high school.  Yeah.  When they died, man.  Yeah.  Who, Buddy Holly?  Yeah, Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper.  Very good. 
[03:52:30]  Funny.  Pat?  Hey.  Thoughts?  You rocks wiping the floor.  What was that, a wet fart, Jimmy?  Nah, it was just a loop.  That was funny.  What did you think, Patty?  When it hit your hand, you felt it, didn't you?  Hmm.  Yeah, I was like...  You were like what, Pat?  Like what?  I heard the noise and it scared the hell out of me.  The latex glove blew up like it was on Howie Mandel's head.  We used to shock you, Patty?  Yeah. 
[03:53:00]  I was...  It made me very...  Well, I didn't expect it.  Let's put it that way.  Half the time, she looks like Roger Daltrey in Tommy.  She's just staring off into...  What are you looking at?  I don't know.  Another dimension?  Yeah.  I'm in the outer limits.  I took that one step beyond.  I went way beyond. 
[03:53:30]  Two 1950s shows.  What?  One step beyond.  Yeah, the outer limits didn't go one step beyond.  Those are from the late 60s, early 70s.  Yeah, but they didn't go one step beyond the outer limits.  It's like you're on Star Trek, Patty.  One step beyond.  One step beyond.  And the outer limits was the outer limits.  Yeah.  So what do you mean?  You feel like you're on the outer limits and you went one step beyond.  What do you mean by that?  I went into the fifth dimension.  Wow.  Musical groups. 
[03:54:00]  It's a Rod Serling show.  The Humorless Zone.  The Humorless Zone, yeah.  It's like Star Trek.  It's like Star Trek, Patty.  Yeah, it is like Star Trek.  I was a Trekkie once.  So how is it like Star Trek, you think?  Outer space.  Outer limits.  Oh wait, we actually missed a good line. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, what was it, Patty?  We actually missed a good line.  Oh, sorry.  Outer go where no woman like me has gone.  For my 53 years.  Idiots.  How did we get the quickest improver and the slowest improver?  Yeah, it's like a Guinness Book of World Records moment.  Uh, Pat, talk.  Hello?  Is that mic working?  It's on.  Hirokh, don't yell at me.  What am I doing wrong?  I don't know.  It's really low.  All right, another runner-up line of the day. 
[03:55:00]  Pat, how's it going?  It's going, it's going.  Ah, memories.  That might be it for another decade.  Yeah.  Hey, Lisa, what are the odds of bringing Pat back to your room for a little while?  Uh, I don't know.  Exactly.  Pat, enjoy it.  It's going to be a while.  I was just going to say, I had other things to do, but maybe later.  Pat, anything to plug?  I'm going to be on Dr. Steve's show tonight. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, is he here tonight?  No, no, no.  It's Saturday night.  Oh.  Nine o'clock.  I like Dr. Steve.  And I'm recording with Mongo the Trucker and Struff.  They're doing a podcast that will hopefully be on one of those Saturday night things.  All right, very good.  So I'm in high demand.  Very good.  Patty, what are you doing?  Me?  I got to go home and clean my place and figure out meals for today since I don't have a refrigerator.  Oh, gosh.  What? 
[03:56:00]  You don't have a refrigerator?  Yeah, it broke.  So I had to throw it away.  So how are you going to figure out meals?  Like, what is that process?  Eat everything before it spoils.  I got to figure out, you know, what I can afford to get in the supermarket.  Holy shit.  Here's some advice.  Non-perishables.  Yeah, I know, but that's why they're more expensive.  Top ramen noodles are good.  They're like 99 cents.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, I guess it's ramen noodles.  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  How much in a new refrigerator?  Are you going to be able to get one?  I have to get, I want to get a little dormitory style type size because it's only for me and 
[03:56:30]  I don't store that much food anyway.  You mean like the little ones we throw away over here all the time for no reason?  How did it break?  It just stopped working.  It was more than 10 years old.  It was old when I got there and it was in poor shape then and it finally broke down altogether.  So I had to just get it removed so maintenance came up and took it out.  She just babbled.  Then the building wanted to charge me for another one and I said, no, I can buy a better 
[03:57:00]  one, maybe at Best Buy a lot cheaper.  How much are they there?  I don't know.  I think they run about $50, $70.  I got to wait until July.  More than that for a refrigerator?  I don't know.  How big is your apartment?  It's been a long time since I've gone to Home Depot.  I don't know.  All right, you can answer that one if you want.  How big is your apartment?  Studio?  What?  Is it a studio, your apartment?  I live in one room in SRO, so it's got to be a small refrigerator. 
[03:57:30]  It's got to be a dormitory style that students use.  I want to get her a massive refrigerator.  It won't fit.  She was in like a roach motel, only smaller.  All right, why don't we do another runner-up?  This is, oh, line in, well.  Otto, get ready to take your bow, my friend.  Get ready to take your bow. 
[03:58:00]  Why doesn't she have a refrigerator?  Patty.  Why does she breathe?  Yeah, that's true.  Patty, what are you going to do?  All that food's going to get cold, right?  I mean, hot.  I just, well, I got nuts and seeds and raisins in my cooler box at home, my little purple  thing that I put the food in to protect it.  I could get pasta and cook that.  Pasta?  Maybe bring a couple butters home from work, you know.  Butter?  Yeah, that doesn't need refrigeration.  You steal butter from Starbucks? 
[03:58:30]  Well, I buy bagels all the time, so I buy a bagel and take a little extra butter.  Patty, can I come over to your house and have a rancid buttered bagel?  No, no, I use it right away.  Nothing sits.  Yeah, why don't you just put some butter in the closet?  Yeah.  Or I just go to a restaurant and get, like, takeout, but my diet is explicit.  I only eat fruits and vegetables, nothing out of cans.  You don't eat meat?  I make my soup fresh. 
[03:59:00]  You don't eat meat?  No.  You make fresh soup?  I don't like meat.  Who has the time?  You take big dumps?  You know.  How about your dumps?  Normal, I guess.  I eat a lot of seafood and shrimp.  I'll buy shrimp.  I'm enough for one and a half.  Oh, God.  Shrimp and un...  Patty.  Fucking unrefrigerated shrimp.  That's disgusting.  Patty, if you could squeeze out a nugget and it hits the floor, I'll buy you a  fridge right now.  I don't have any.  I'm sorry.  I don't have any.  Just one nugget.  One little nugget pops out and hits the floor. 
[03:59:30]  That's right.  And rolls across the studio.  But I don't have anything.  I already went to the big...  How about this fucking...  Yeah, logs for a fridge.  Logs for a fridge.  Come on.  Great contest.  That's right.  Yeah.  But I don't have anything.  Just take a shit.  I don't have anything.  I don't have anything.  That's right.  Shit more for a Kenmore.  Yeah.  But I don't have anything.  I don't have to go. 
[04:00:00]  Just drop a little milk dud in the rug.  One milk dud.  You can't just will that.  There you can.  There you can.  You want to see Danny do it?  He'll do it in a second, man.  But he doesn't need anything right now.  Yeah, Patty.  All your food's getting hot.  Yeah.  Jimmy was able to fart on command when you were...  You had your face in his ass.  I wasn't going to let you put a finger on my ass.  I wanted to fart on your hand.  You felt it, didn't you?  Yeah, I did.  I felt the wind.  And then I had to fan myself away for a few minutes. 
[04:00:30]  The wind cried, Jimmy.  Yeah, you got that right for a second there.  I was like, oh no.  Why do you smell it?  It could have been shortened.  I couldn't have said it better.  Are we ready for line of the day or what?  Everybody blew the doors off, huh?  Lisa Sparks, what are we promoting?  The website?  Yeah.  For your husband?  Yeah.  Yeah, just for him.  3Xs and a .com and you'll get to Lisa Sparks. 
[04:01:00]  Sexy girl.  Is there any passwords you got there?  Oh, Pat wants to maybe be hooked up for somebody.  For a guy on a budget?  Yeah, Pat has no money.  He makes about a hundred.  You know what?  If you send me an email, I don't do that, but I'm sure he'll be more than welcome and more  than happy to do that for you.  Good.  Your jealous husband?  Is he jealous?  I don't know.  Pat from Minaki might make less money than Stalker Patty.  I hate to say it, Pat.  I'm really sorry to say that, but. 
[04:01:30]  It's close.  Is it really?  How's the van?  Oh, that's not good.  It's, uh, starters starting to go.  Stay a little bit longer.  Every time we go to start it.  Ah, here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  The happy clown always. 
[04:02:00]  I know.  It's like Tor Johnson bobbing for gonorrhea.  There you go, Otto.  Here, it's right down here.  Otto, line of the day.  Showboat hotel and casino.  Atlantic City.  House of Blues.  July 5th.  July 5th.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Get your fucking tickets.  Make the promoter happy. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  Happery.  Happy.  Happery.  All right.  And, uh, Patty, what do you got?  Eastside.  What do I got?  Bring Eastside in for a sec.  I don't have any websites to promote.  I know, but you're going to be good this time.  Eastside.  Hey, Dave.  Hi, how are you, Ron Fez, noon to three?  Dude, you fucking got branded yesterday, and I heard, I heard you were going to get branded,  and I'm thinking, that, that is unbelievable, but then Sam was explaining the process.  You pretty much got, somebody was writing with a blowtorch on your ass, basically? 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, it happened.  Did you hear this?  I thought it was going to be a quick little, you know, stamp.  Which would be awful, but the guy had to, like, the guy had to write the, the, whatever  he was writing, Ichiban, right?  Ichiban, uh, it happened over, uh, a period of a half an hour.  Holy, um.  Wait, come, come over here.  Oh my God, he's completely fucking burned.  It's, it was really, hi Jim.  Hi Dave.  That was, that was not me putting the gum under there.  Who was it?  Wow.  It's not me.  Not me either.  I know it's not Jim, he's a professional. 
[04:03:30]  Holy shit!  Nice cock, Dave.  So, oh, I didn't mean this.  So, it, it was, took place over a half an hour of the guy just using a blowtorch on  my ass.  That was, uh, worse.  A pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  At least he took good medical care.  I see the saran wrap and masking tape.  Yeah.  Well, I figured out myself to be a home doctor of sorts.  Uh, Dave, what do you guys do?  How do you use a stick?  We could use the, uh, saran wrap.  Thank you, Nurse Nightingale, for that fucking great expertise. 
[04:04:00]  Dave.  Um, it's, yeah, it's very painful.  I, actually, it wasn't so bad yesterday and then today.  I, I'm having trouble.  I can't even imagine, man.  I'm having trouble.  A lot of trouble.  Don't forget to take it off when you shit.  This is the problem.  I, I only have, I only packed one thing of cellophane today.  And it's on my ass right now.  Dude, you ever get a bad scab and it starts drying out?  When that shit starts drying out and scabbing, you're going to be in deep shit.  Yes, I'm already in the deep shit.  I feel, and I have to do, uh, shitties this morning. 
[04:04:30]  Shitties.  But I don't have any more cellophane packed.  So take that off first and then shit.  I think once it's already there, Mr. Jim, uh, it's, that's it.  He said, I officially bow to you.  I'm not even joking.  I'm not even going to fuck around with this.  I'm not even fucking around anymore.  I bow to you.  Because I thought it was going to be a quick little, little brand.  Like, oh, God.  The guy wrote that, what you're looking at, with a blowtorch.  With a red hot, like.  No, I know.  A tiny blowtorch, right? 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be the same thing.  And then all of a sudden a character out of Pulp Fiction came out with a blowtorch and  decided to torture me for fucking 25 minutes.  Did he take a metal rod and heat it up and then draw on you?  Is that what it was?  Because I actually couldn't turn it around, but all I heard was flames and blowtorch.  I don't see anything on that camera.  A metal.  Skin fizzling.  Yeah.  My hat's smell.  I heard the smell was horrendous.  Oh, it was awful.  Let me see what they say.  Sam, who's pretty much a member of the Ron and Fez show, was there.  It says, it's Japanese for Ichiban, which is the, uh, number one. 
[04:05:30]  Ichiban.  That's what you have.  Ichiburn.  I've got a good one.  Lisa, are you impressed with that?  The tattoo or?  It's a brand, man.  That's no tattoo.  I was going to say, or when he was doing the fancy dance over there.  Patty, what do you think?  What do you think of that?  That's cool.  Real closely, Patty.  Just touch it for a little bit.  Just touch it.  Big deal.  Touch it.  Touch it.  Touch it.  Touch it.  That's crazy, though.  Touch it.  Will he touch this thing, then? 
[04:06:00]  She won't touch the cock, either.  Yeah, I know.  Smart idea.  It's got to be hurt.  No.  If I touch it, he'll might hit the ceiling.  In the midst of an outbreak.  It's got to hurt.  See these little red dots here?  This is just eczema, guys.  It's not herpetic.  He's like, I swear it's not herpetic.  It's not herpetic.  It's eczema.  I'm under a lot of stress.  So, Patty, what do you think of that?  Some saran wrap on the S.  Very painful.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Mind if I don't shake your hand, Dave? 
[04:06:30]  Oh, and a six to noon round, Fez, noon to three.  Thank you very much.  Dave, right on, man.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Patty, what do you think of the branding on the S?  It was so painful.  At one point, I had to go downstairs and get the mail because I couldn't bear to hear him scream.  The screaming scared me.  It's amazing how she's auditory cancer.  Yeah.  Everything that comes out of her mouth is worthless, unfunny.  There's no literal. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  There's nothing interesting or knowledgeable.  You're a waste.  No, I'm not.  I'm very smart.  Hey, Patty.  Oh, not like people say.  Patty, Matt from Philly writes, shave Patty's head.  Lose the hair for a Frigidaire.  What do you say?  No.  Oh.  No.  Tell that guy to erase that now.  All right, lock the door.  It's time.  We need the big ending.  We need the big ending.  No way.  Yeah, lock the door.  Here we go.  You're not shaving my head. 
[04:07:30]  I'm not going through that again.  No.  You shaved the head once?  No, I'm not doing that.  That guy, stop it right now.  Just stop it.  You're not.  I'm not dealing with that again.  Bring in the raisins.  It's very hard.  She's adamant.  Pat, bring in the raisins.  Or adamant.  No, do not even do that to me.  Come in the other door, Pat.  Don't.  Don't.  I don't want that done to me.  I said no.  I said no.  No means what? 
[04:08:00]  No means no.  No means yes.  No.  Just walk over there.  I don't want you to.  No.  No.  Shit, Patty.  No.  Get a...  No.  What a maroon.  No.  Patty, don't worry.  No.  They wouldn't do it if you didn't want it done.  No.  No, she's crying.  All right.  Stop.  Patty, leave her alone.  All right.  Leave her alone.  Patty, come here.  It's okay.  No crying.  Come here. 
[04:08:30]  You're okay.  It's okay.  Don't have a heart attack.  Oh, my God.  Patty, come here.  What is this?  We're kidding.  Oh, my gosh.  Patty, don't cry.  There's no crying on the radio.  Patty, it's okay.  Come back.  No one's going to do anything.  I'm just going to cut your precious locks.  Patty, watch.  Look, Pat Duffy's leaving the studio with the razor or whatever, the shaver.  No crying, Patty.  Come over here.  Pat from Menaki, will you hug her, please?  Don't worry about it.  Do I have to?  No. 
[04:09:00]  Come back to the chair.  Come back to the chair.  Patty.  Come back to the chair.  Come back to the chair.  Come here.  Stop it.  We're doing it for the reaction.  I didn't think we'd get that reaction, but come on over here, Patty.  Stop whining.  Pat, come over here.  What are you doing?  You're behaving like a boob.  Come here by me, Patty.  Yeah, don't be a baby.  Oh, my God.  Come sit down.  I'm not going to shave your dumb hair.  It's like it brings back...  It's all that room.  Patty, what are you crying for so much?  Patty, why are you crying?  Why are you crying?  Nobody even touched you.  Yeah.  Stop being a baby.  Why are you crying? 
[04:09:30]  Because she doesn't have a fridge.  Hey, Frigeless, why are you crying?  I feel like I'm watching the accused.  Patty.  Patty, what's the matter?  When you go to Patty's place, don't drink the milk.  It's spoiled.  Those little rascals.  Hey, Patty, why are you crying?  Yeah, come over here.  You know we love you.  Patty.  She's hiding in a corner like a cockroach.  I would never go through that again.  Well, don't worry.  You don't have to.  What was wrong with it?  You got to see you, too.  You got money.  You got a lot of stuff out of the shaved head bit. 
[04:10:00]  Remember?  What was wrong about the shaved head bit?  Because I don't want to go through that again.  It took me five years to grow it.  I don't want to do that again.  I don't feel attractive with it that way.  I feel like, no, it was humiliating.  I don't want to deal with that again.  I don't deserve that.  Sure, your hot stick of butter and your rotting shrimp.  Fuck.  She's got Starbucks leaking from her eyes.  Patty.  But, Patty, I thought you enjoyed the attention and all that.  Stop crying. 
[04:10:30]  Remember when we shaved it twice, didn't we?  Not that.  Felt bad for her for a second, you know?  Punch her in the head now.  There's no crying and teasing.  Oh, maybe there is.  I make my own soup.  Boom.  Patty, you all right?  Patty.  I thought you liked the whole shaving of the head thing.  I don't.  It was a memory that people still talk about to this day.  It is just, I don't enjoy it, okay? 
[04:11:00]  I don't.  I don't hate you.  I don't.  We didn't expect you to cry.  Now we're going to look like bad guys.  Help the show out.  Yeah, man.  I'm sorry.  Shave that empty head.  Wow.  God, you're the worst.  The erotic shrimp.  And whoever suggested that on top talk, that was a rock.  Patty.  Oh, is that great?  Patty, you're shaking.  It brings back bad memories?  I don't want that ever done to me again. 
[04:11:30]  That's so well.  It wasn't a rape.  Jesus.  Why are you shaking?  Yeah.  Why are you shaking?  We're not going to shave your head again.  Don't worry.  God, enough.  But I'll tell you this much, there'll be a couple more occasions where we make believe  we're going to, so maybe the next time we make believe, because that's probably the  third or fourth time we made believe, you've got to understand that we're not actually going  to do it.  We're just going for the reaction.  Then maybe it'll help you a little bit.  She's still looking around.  We're not shaving your head.  They'll crucify us if we do that.  Oh my God, really?  Somehow she became a fan favorite after all these years. 
[04:12:00]  Yeah.  We can't touch her.  She's one of these people we can't touch because our own fans will kill us.  How did that happen?  Come on, Patty.  How about an improv to pick us all up?  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, Patty.  Pat, will you hug her, please?  You're the big burly type.  Here, let Pat hug you, Patty.  Aww.  Does that make you feel...  It'll be all right.  Does that make you feel better? 
[04:12:30]  Yeah, I'm still upset.  Why?  Nothing happened.  Fuck.  It's got a little long.  I know.  Can we cut maybe like an inch off?  No.  That's okay.  Let Pat lick your pussy.  He's pretty good at it from what I hear.  I hope you're talking about a cat.  What?  I already have a person at work that does work for me on my hair, and she's fine.  She puts the coloring in it when I want her to and stuff.  Mocha chips. 
[04:13:00]  Hey, Jimmy, I feel bad.  Can you pass this over to Patty?  I feel really bad.  Here.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Looks like someone's got three smackaroos to play with.  Look at that.  All right, Patty.  Not one, not two, but three, four.  Four smackaroos to go do whatever you want.  I like to just say the old president that's on there.  There's four George Washingtons for you.  There's four crispy GWs here. 
[04:13:30]  As a matter of fact, I'm going to throw a GW in there.  Make it not.  All right.  You could buy a bag of ice with that.  There you go, Patty.  That's right.  Put the wig on, Pat.  There you go, Patty.  Here's $6.  Oh, God.  I want to see Pat with the wig on.  Patty, $6 to do with what you will.  There you go.  Six whole dollars.  That's right, Patty.  $6.  $6.  $6.  Look at that.  Jesus Christ.  I'm not Valerie Bertinelli.  It still looks better than Gene Simmons' wig. 
[04:14:00]  I'm not only the president.  I'm also a member.  You look like Lady Di.  You look like Lady Di.  She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking Pat.  Don't cut my hand.  Don't cut my hand.  Isn't he great?  Wait, Pat.  I've got to get a pension.  Come over here.  That's fantastic.  Pat.  Yes?  He looks like one of those old lesbians that got married.  Yeah, you look like Doris or whatever her name was. 
[04:14:30]  Del, was it?  Del.  Pat, come over here.  I've got to get a picture of you.  Be the lovable clown for everybody.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't move.  Jim just goes, ugh.  Awful.  Right.  What's that going to take?  Ugh.  That looks good.  Well, hey.  Basically, the way Pat acts is the soul of every comedian.  Right.  That's why we want to smash his teeth, because he is us exposed.  Really?  Yes.  It's the love me.  Oh.  Hey, Pat.  What comics do? 
[04:15:00]  I know this is radio, but do some impressions with the wig on.  I like the Beatles one.  You can start with that one again.  Yeah.  Could you do Lennon?  Yeah.  Or George Harris.  I'm really going to trim that mole.  That a Walton's reference?  All right.  Here he goes.  Uh, I need some, you gotta, no, you don't have a pigeon.  I was going to do a Fabio on a rollercoaster.  How about diamonds are a girl's best friend?  Yeah. 
[04:15:30]  Uh, uh, uh, I'm not standing over a grate.  Well, Patty, what do you think of the wig?  Patty.  I don't let you hear, Patty.  I really should have trimmed down this morning.  He's not very good with props.  Uh, uh, your, your carrot flop.  I started with my Valerie Bertinelli.  Her little forehead.  Your carrot flop.  There you go, Danny. 
[04:16:00]  Good one from Danny.  He's good props.  Come on, Pat.  Run with it.  You got the wig.  Let's run with it.  Duck season fire.  Duck season fire.  Holy shit.  That's so funny.  Kennedy in Dallas.  Hey, that was Oswald's joke.  Hey, that was Oswald's joke. 
[04:16:30]  Patty, what do you think of the wig?  Go.  It's funny.  It's funny.  It's funny.  He, he, he, he.  It's funny.  It's funny.  That's about all my wig material.  Carrot flop.  I belong to the wig party.  Let me get another picture.  1785.  1885.  Do me good luck, Pat. 
[04:17:00]  There.  Very good.  All right.  We should go.  I love Pat.  Oh, thank you.  That's the best.  I don't know why you haven't been on the show.  Well, I do.  It's been way too fucking long, Pat.  Lately, you've been on, but there's a big gap in there for whatever reason.  You like Norman Vazio's mother.  Yeah, like between my toes.  I remember the first day he was on, remember Anthony, how many, because Pat didn't have  headphones on.  Yeah.  And he got so many car crashes. 
[04:17:30]  Car crashed everything he said.  I laughed so, can we find Pat's first appearance?  I didn't have headphones on.  All I saw was Anthony hitting a button.  I don't know what that meant.  Yeah, that was it.  Can we find Pat's first appearance?  That's Eggnog from.  I think it was.  Actually, yeah, cherry darts.  Does Travis have a line?  Travis has a line.  No, no, no, no.  I think it's funny.  I just think he looks like the evil mother from the Goonies. 
[04:18:00]  Oh, that's funny.  I saw that movie.  Was she the same one as Throw Mom?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh.  She belongs to the wig party.  From Sophia, George Washington.  W-H-I-G?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Ear wig.  Oh, God.  God almighty.  Oh, shit.  We should elect him president.  He's a member of the wig party.  I'll vote for him.  Huh?  I'll vote for him.  Patty, do you know what funny is at all? 
[04:18:30]  Yeah.  Do you know what improvisation is?  Yeah, doing things off the top of your head.  Yeah.  Without any preparation.  Right.  And then to make it funny, like you react to what someone else says, and you add your  own tag on there, and it makes it funnier, and people laugh.  This is what we have to do.  Mad Libs with Patty.  Oh, that's good.  You like Mad Libs?  Remember Mad Libs? 
[04:19:00]  Yeah, I remember that.  I enjoyed the game.  Sure you did.  Do we have one real quick?  No.  We need a dirty one.  I know.  Sad Libs.  We need a dirty one right now?  I mean, just maybe one or two lines.  I always can't do a whole one.  We've done the show, but...  Get a Mad Lib and see what happens.  Yeah.  Bad Libs.  I think we've done as much as we can with this crew.  Beast.  They used to sell those books.  I can't find them anymore.  Did you?  Shut up.  What were they?  They were Mad Libs books.  I bet you were good at them, right?

One very nice morning near the end of summer,  my mother woke me up at 4 a.m. and said,  Wake up and smell the grass, sleepyhead.  Today is your first day of school and you can't be late.  I groaned in my bed for 20 seconds,  but eventually I got dressed.  I wore a blue and white striped long-sleeved elephant.  Who would have worn that?  Must have weighed you down.  With a collar on it, a red tie, dark gray pants, 
[04:22:30]  white socks, black shoes, and a beautiful hat.  In 10 minutes, I made lunch and ate breakfast.  I wish that beautiful hat was shaped like a fucking jump truck bumper.  Seven hours later, the bus came, and in a few minutes,  I was already at school.  In school, I met two really nice kids.  All of us became friends very fast.  That day, we had science, and luckily,  my friends and I were the same moon. 
[04:23:00]  Both asses?  My friends' names are Opie and Anthony.  All right, let's redo it with dirty shit.  That just sucks.  You suck, Patty.  That's not fun at all.
