<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about a statement concerning a legal battle over the Black Sabbath trademark between Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi.  Initially believing the statement originated from Ozzy himself, the hosts later discovered it was authored by a Ted Osborne.  The statement detailed Black Sabbath's history, its renewed popularity following the 1997 reunion, and Ozzy's assertion that the trademark should be shared equally among the four original band members.

The show then segued into a series of unrelated comedic segments.  These included a humorous exchange mimicking CB radio jargon, a farcical story about a conflict between the show's engineer, "E-Rock," and the planet Mars, and a conversation about the erratic behavior of kittens. This culminated in Opie recounting a bizarre and unexplained anecdote involving his wife's unexpected reaction to something unseen.  No guests were mentioned in the provided summaries.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show, on the virus.  What's Ozzy saying, Jimmy? Released a statement on Tony Iommi's losses.  Did not hear that.  Is this a new statement from Ozzy?  Must be. I have not heard any statements from Ozzy.  What did he say?  I don't know. I'm asking you. You're the Ozzy guy.  But no one told me anything.  You're all Ozzy all the time, my friend.  I don't... Let me see.  Is there a new statement or is this an old statement?  I didn't even see this.  Last week, the news broke... 
[00:00:30]  Oh, here's the statement. Wow, it's a long one.  It's a lot of reading. I don't know if we want to get into a lot of reading, Jimmy.  I'll explain it.  If it's Ozzy.  All right.  It is with great regret that I had to resort to legal action against my longtime partner, Tony Iommi.  But after three years of trying to resolve this issue abacably,  I feel that no other recourse...  Reads a statement from Ozzy.  As of the... 
[00:01:00]  I'll do that part for you.  As of the... Okay.  As of the mid-1990s, after constant numerous changes in band members,  the brand of Black Sabbath was literally in the toilet,  and Tony Iommi...  Touring under the new name Black Sabbath.  ...was reduced to performing in clubs.  Oh, damn.  Since 1997, when Giza, Bill, and myself rejoined the band,  Black Sabbath has returned to its former glory 
[00:01:30]  as we headline sold-out arenas and amphitheaters,  playing to upwards of 50,000 people at each show around the world.  I wonder who worded this, because I didn't.  We worked collectively to restore credibility and bring dignity back...  Dignity?  ...to the name Black Sabbath,  which led to the band being inducted into the UK and US Rock and Roll Hall of Famers,  in which Jim Norton asked some very poignant questions in 2005 and 2006... 
[00:02:00]  That doesn't say that.  ...respectively.  I see it.  It's right there.  Throughout the last 12 years, it was my management representatives  who oversaw the marketing and quality control of the Black Sabbath brand  through OzFest touring, merchandising, and album reissues.  He did...  You're absolutely right.  This is not Ozzy.  It doesn't...  It doesn't...  It's not written like Ozzy would say this shit.  The name Black Sabbath now has a worldwide prestige and merchandising value. 
[00:02:30]  I've never said those words in my life.  Look at this PowerPoint presentation.  That it would not have had by continuing on the road it was on prior to the 1997 reunion tour.  Then Ozzy addressed I owe me personally by saying...  Tony, I am so sorry it had to get to this point by me having to take this action against you.  I don't have the right to speak for Geezer and Bill,  but I feel that morally and ethically the trademark should be owned by the four of us equally. 
[00:03:00]  I'd hope that by taking this first step, that it will ultimately end up that way.  We've all worked too hard and long in our career to allow you to sell merchandise that features all of our faces,  our Black Sabbath album covers, and bad logos.  And then you tell us that you own the copyright. 
[00:03:30]  We're all in our 60s now.  The Black Sabbath legacy should live on long after we are all gone.  Please do the right thing.  What happened?  It sounds a little...  It's Ted Osborne.  It's Ted Osborne.  Ted Osborne.  Ted Osborne.  How annoying was that for everyone listening?  My apologies.  It's fantastic.  I'm getting into it.  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  So you keep, like, a little CB or something in the room so you can hear it if it's...  What do you do if it's a CB? 
[00:04:00]  What is he, a truck driver?  It's called a baby monitor.  Breaker 1-9, Breaker 1-9, Trap Dog, you out there?  You got your ears on?  Yeah, I've been needing a little formula over here.  Never keep the shiny side up and the dirty side down.  We south side and gone.  Keep it between the dishes, Trav Eye, and by those I mean your butt cheeks.  We got to get this formula to text Arcanus.  E-Rock is screaming at Mars outside. 
[00:04:30]  I just got a text right outside that door.  The planet or our engineer?  Yes, they're fighting it out for a position on the new chart of the solar system.  E-Rock is angry that Mars is throwing his orbit off.  And bringing him too close to the sun.  Exactly.  E-Rock's yelling, call me Mr. Pitter.  Mr. Pitter. 
[00:05:00]  He's all annoyed.  Thank you.  That's a very cute kitten.  All right, now you're just putting adorable, adorable kitten footage on.  A little kitten attacking some guy's hand and then spreading out their paws when he pulls his hand back.  All right, kittens are very cute.  Who doesn't love a kitten?  Turn into pissing, fucking clawing your rug things.  Here's the rule.  I play with a kitten until it's six months and then I put it down at the garbage disposal and I get a new one.  She was sitting on the couch.  She started screaming and she called me downstairs. 
[00:05:30]  She's down there with her pants down to her ankles.  I think it's right.  Can you talk slower?  I was scared.  She was scared?  This is your wife we're talking about, right?  There wasn't two pounds, that's for sure.  She's screaming her pants down.  She says, I'm scared.  Is there a black channel going out the window?  Opie and Anthony live next. 
[00:06:00]  I'm scared.
