<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' trademark self-deprecating humor and rambling non sequiturs, touching upon drug dealers, rock stars, and a bizarre computer-shooting incident.  A significant portion focused on Opie's Red Sox obsession and his critical commentary on Tim Wakefield's knuckleball pitching during the baseball playoffs, including his predictions (and the subsequent listener reactions, particularly from grateful Cleveland fans).  The show then addressed its own precarious broadcasting situation, highlighting potential cancellations in Detroit, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Philadelphia, with specific concerns raised about a lack of communication from a new Philadelphia program director.  Several listener calls followed, ranging from baseball discussions to anxieties about the show's future, including a "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday" segment featuring a caller's suggestive wake-up attempt.  The hosts also discussed Ellen DeGeneres' on-air emotional breakdown, initially speculating on a tragedy before revealing it stemmed from a penis-on-a-pillow dream.  They briefly mentioned a Vanity Fair article and Donald Trump's criticism of Angelina Jolie.

The show continued with a lengthy discussion about Ellen DeGeneres' adoption and subsequent relinquishment of a dog named Iggy, focusing on the negative media reaction and the hosts' use of derogatory language towards Ellen and the involved animal rescue organization.  This was followed by a news story about a seven-foot python found in a Brooklyn woman's toilet, prompting speculation about its origins and a discussion about rats in plumbing.  Further listener calls for the "Wake Up Your Spouse" segment were aired, along with brief mentions of John Mayer's birthday party, Donald Trump's book and attacks on Angelina Jolie, a photoshopped image of the Pope in a fire, and Jim Norton's stand-up performances.  The segment ended with a heated exchange between Opie and a staff member, possibly an audio engineer named Eric, concerning technical difficulties and a soundbite issue involving a staff member named Tim.

Technical difficulties with the show's CD players dominated a significant portion of the broadcast, causing frustration as the hosts struggled to play pre-recorded segments.  This led to a humorous examination of the aforementioned Photoshopped image of the Pope in a bonfire, sparking jokes about religion and hell.  Listener calls followed, leading into a lengthy, highly profane in-studio interview with comedian Pat Cooper.  The conversation with Cooper, filled with explicit language and insults, covered his career, opinions on other comedians (both positive and negative), his comedic style, roasting techniques, and general perspectives on the comedy world.  He shared numerous anecdotes from his career, including roast experiences and interactions with celebrities.  The hosts also promoted upcoming appearances, including a Friars Club roast where Pat Cooper would be roasted and their own participation in his roast.  Due to time constraints, the "Morning Zoo" segment was postponed.

The interview with Pat Cooper continued, beginning with a humorous anecdote about a man who overbought pizza boxes.  This transitioned into a scathing, expletive-laden critique of Imus, detailing alleged injustices and a physical altercation involving Imus and a former sports commentator.  The conversation expanded to include Cooper's vehement dislike for Reverend Al Sharpton (using offensive terms), his views on political correctness in radio and the changing comedy landscape, and personal experiences with various celebrities.  He recounted a confrontation with a non-English-speaking mall employee and shared anecdotes about his family life, including his mother's aggressive disciplinary methods and his strained relationship with his father.  Further discussion touched upon his disdain for reality television, his admiration for Donald Trump, his views on global warming and Al Gore, and graphic details about his bowel habits.  He also discussed experiences in Spain, his views on aging and mortality, and the challenges of maintaining his comedic style in a more politically correct environment.  The show concluded with promotion of the Friars Club roast and his website, patcooper.com.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Testing 1, 2, 1, 2.  Po, po, bo, bo, banana, nana.  Banana, fana, fo, fo, fee, five, mo, mo.  Po!  Who thought you were dead? The people you were partying with?  Dealers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff.  And they just throw them in a dumpster in London. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know, I left them there.  I think it's pretty funny.  No one wants to get rock stars.  This is where entertainment is going.  I shot my computer.  You can't shoot guns in suburbia.  And I fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Opie and Anthony.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be, as you're kissing one,  to feel his manhand holding your head like the sweat of a manhand right on the face of your neck.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  This palaver.  Palavery.  I haven't forgot about that one.  Duh, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  My name is William.  And I like fingernail polish.  I like turtles.  Fingernail polish. 
[00:02:00]  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Push your balls to my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth I will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee.  Wee.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The ONA virus spreading across America, but the virus is being cured in a few cities.  Oy, oy, oy, oy. 
[00:02:30]  Is there an inoculation?  Ah, I guess they found one in Detroit.  I guess they found one in Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  I want to say good morning to Boston.  We're going to be there, what, a week from Friday for the Halloween party.  I think you better watch for nooses being hung up on your behalf.  I think they're a little angry with you.  Why are they angry with me? 
[00:03:00]  They should be angry at Tim Wakefield and his freaking 30-mile-an-hour fastball.  His rollercoaster, we get it, your rollercoaster freaking pitch where the catcher has to go,  wait a minute, I've got to go get my really big catcher's mitt.  I've got to catch for Tim Wakefield tonight.  He watched that Bugs Bunny episode where you're able to throw the slow ball.  Right.  And then the batter goes, one, two, three, stretcher out.  One, two, three, stretcher out.  He takes three swings at one pitch.  Well, instead, it was, you know, hit after hit after hit after hit after hit. 
[00:03:30]  How many runs in the fifth inning last night for the Indians?  Seven?  Oh, my God.  Seven, right?  Knocking Wakefield out because of his stupid topsy-turvy pitch.  Topsy-turvy.  Enough with the stupid freaking...  Boston fans must just, like, tighten up and clench their teeth whenever they see him throw that ball.  Because it does look like you're just practice. 
[00:04:00]  It's like batting practice.  And you're kind of just lobbing the ball in for the guy.  I know it's a very tricky pitch to hit at times.  But, boy, not last night.  Looks like you shot-putting a pitch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just kind of lob it in.  Hey, if you want to crack this one, go ahead.  Give it a hit.  I love the announcers because they have to, like, you know, make sure you understand that.  Well, we don't know where this pitch is going to go. 
[00:04:30]  Then they've got to point out how big the catcher's mitt is.  And it's a lot bigger than a standard freaking catcher's mitt.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, because the pitch is going all over the place.  And blah, blah, blah.  We get it.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  That's the sound of a Tim Wakefield pitch.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  You know, like, you have to make UFO noises when he pitches.  Here it is going down there.  I can't hit it.  It's going all over wacky. 
[00:05:00]  Wow, that's unusual.  Tim Wakefield decided to throw his 35-mile-an-hour fastball in between 20 knuckleballs.  Well, I still say, go, Sox, go.  Well, one game away from elimination.  And, well, lots of instant feedback already.  You can get to the instant feedback link or one of them.  We're still trying to get all the instant feedback links on onaradio.com.  I guess the link on that website actually goes to the KROQ site here in New York City. 
[00:05:30]  And that one we don't check as often.  There's a main one for everybody that we check, you know, constantly during the show.  And we're trying to link that one up to the onaradio.com website.  How did it miss foundry?  Brian Kelly, Cleveland.  Thank you, Opie, from the Cleveland fans.  Keep it up.  Boston, oh, my God.  Why, oh, why did you have to want the Red Sox to win?  Why can't you just stop watching once the Mets were out, huh? 
[00:06:00]  Jesus, H, Opie, why?  He's a fan of the Red Sox.  And that is why he was rooting for the Red Sox.  I see a lot of Cleveland people thanking you.  I'm looking at...  Look at instant feedback.  I'll talk instant feedback.  Opie, Cleveland loves you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Cleveland, you don't seem to understand something here.  You really don't seem to grasp the big picture, I like to call it. 
[00:06:30]  The big picture.  Yes, indeed.  Opie is rooting for the Red Sox.  And I'm truly rooting for the Red Sox.  Yeah.  This whole thing is just...  It's the way it works with Opie.  He actually wants the Red Sox to win.  It's not like, I'll pick them so they lose.  It doesn't work that way.  He wants them to win.  My dream World Series is the Mets and the Red Sox going at it again.  Of course.  That's my dream.  I'm a huge Mets fan.  I hate the Yankees.  That is also the dream Red Sox fan pairing because they know you would be rooting for the Mets. 
[00:07:00]  Absolutely.  And it would be over.  But what Cleveland doesn't seem to understand is that once they get past this and defeat Boston because Opie is such a Boston fan.  Hey, hey, hey.  Go Sox, go.  Exactly.  Do you honestly think Opie is going to root for the Colorado Rockies? 
[00:07:30]  So you're not really seeing the big picture of after this series.  Opie has no interest in Colorado, in the Rockies, the city of Colorado.  I thought about skiing out there once.  City of Colorado.  Whatever.  We understood.  The state of Colorado.  He has no interest in it.  Now, Cleveland, we've been there, on the air there, as far as I know.  I think we're still on the air. 
[00:08:00]  We're going to do a roll call in a few minutes of my life.  Roll call.  Because just to go off on a quick tangent, we got, wow, I can't get past the thank you from Cleveland coming in like crazy.  Yeah.  Well, like I said, look at the next step, Cleveland.  Okay.  Because Opie will, with all his passion, be rooting for Cleveland in the World Series.  How do you know?  How do you know?  How do I know?  I'm kind of, it's not a guarantee, but I just know you and it's a city you're more familiar with. 
[00:08:30]  I'm not willing to look past my beloved Sox.  I'm not looking past the Red Sox.  Let's just see how that goes then.  I'm not looking past.  What are they playing?  Day after tomorrow?  The next game is tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night.  Right.  Okay.  I'm not looking past the Red Sox.  Okay.  All right.  I still say, go Sox, go.  Let's not forget what the Yankees, what happened to the Yankees.  Yeah, I know.  Let's not forget.  It would be an absolute miracle if they could pull it off and do that. 
[00:09:00]  Let's not forget.  Let's not forget what happened.  I understand.  But, but, I'm just saying that if the Sox do lose and it becomes a Cleveland-Colorado World Series,  I would take, I don't even care, rob a bank, rob a bank, put all the money on Colorado,  and then when you win, when you win, give the money back in a package on the bank stoop 
[00:09:30]  and just say, I'm sorry, I needed this for a few minutes.  So you want people to go for the Rockies?  Yeah, because I feel you are going to be rooting for Cleveland.  I can't look past the Red Sox.  Exactly.  I cannot look past the Red Sox.  I'm with you all the way on this one.  You can't look past the Sox yet.  Look, Opie, Cleveland loves you.  Thank you.  They still have hope, but why, you don't understand. 
[00:10:00]  You're praising the executioner as you're watching an execution, but you're standing on line behind the guy.  You're the next guy up on the block.  Look, I still got to work out some formulas before I decide anything.  What am I saying?  The Red Sox are going to win it all.  I've been saying that for a while now.  Yes, you have.  Or at least five or six days now.  You certainly have.  It is kind of funny to see all the thank yous coming in from Cleveland, 
[00:10:30]  the people that do believe in this weird sports curse that I have.  It's amazing.  And for the people in Colorado, all the Rockies fans and just the people, I think, that live in Colorado that don't like baseball but need to sweep their house.  Buy your brooms now because I think brooms are going to be very hard to come by at your local hardware store.  Can I get a broom?  I have to sweep my kitchen.  No, it seems a lot of people are buying brooms to wave in the air at the stadium. 
[00:11:00]  It's just.  Well, you did tell everybody to, you know, go with the Eagles over the Jets.  I told people.  If they would have listened to you, they would have won a, you know, they would have made some nice money.  I told them to just take the kids' college money, the mortgage money, everything, an elderly, infirmed relative's care money, whatever, and put it on the Eagles.  It was such a given.  And now, you know, I mean, I hope this sucks. 
[00:11:30]  Why is Boston blaming me?  You've got to blame Wakefield on that stupid, topsy-curvy pitchy crows.  Topsy-curvy.  Whatever the F it is.  It's a dumb pitch is what it is.  It really does suck the knuckleball.  They don't.  Knuckleball.  He either throws a strike or hits a little kid in the stands.  There's really no in-between with that dumb pitch.  There's a happy young fan.  One, two, three strikes, you're out.  One, two, three strikes, you're out. 
[00:12:00]  Wow.  That's what Boston Red Sox fans were hoping for when Wakefield, you know, takes the mound.  But that wasn't the case in that fifth inning last night.  Nope.  They got the other part of that cliff.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Yeah, that's the clip you need, actually.  The conga line.  A little later on, we'll have audio of that fifth inning.  Of course we will.  See, we produce the show as we go here.  But it's so stupid.  Like I said, it's either a strike or he knocks popcorn out of the vendor's hand. 
[00:12:30]  how can you depend on crap let's say hi to shane in north dakota shane what's up  what's up hey man yeah i just my relationship depends on opie's bad prediction what why is  that because my girlfriend's a red sox fan oh okay does she wear a cute pink red sox hat  yes and it sucks all right thanks old all right man hang in there all right i don't want people 
[00:13:00]  mad at me this is really what i want to happen i want the red sox now that the phillies are out  and before the before the phillies and one of the mets it's just how it goes why is this uh trucker  saying don't mess with what what i don't think this uh frank the trucker understands  your uh your curse yeah frank what's up frank problem yeah i got a problem don't you mess  with my rockies what what would make you think he's going to mess with your rockies 
[00:13:30]  well you're a horrible picker i would say i'm a great picker if you know how to you know  how to bet with them if you know how to play with the bookers well i don't know who's not to say that  i'm making a bloody fortune behind the scenes is that some whacked out esp thing happening  bloody fortune i i'm just predicting i i think in my opinion i don't know because he's still you 
[00:14:00]  know pushing you're pulling for a boston uh i don't know what's gonna happen after that  but i i tend to think he's gonna go with a city he's more familiar with  uh has been uh look man you know i can't look past uh the red sox i gotta be rooting for them  i gotta be staying up late well watching every pitch it's done so well i i don't think you should  stop i think you should really pull for him i'm pulling for the red sox i've been saying that  for almost a week now well go go socks go but then go cleveland go go socks go that's all i'm saying 
[00:14:30]  go socks go is it time to break out the old bloody ankle is that it wasn't that good luck  and rumor has it was paint it was paint red paint lying or ketchup or something why was it to make  himself look weak to make it all sympathetic and really rally everybody i don't know this  of course he was lying that was nothing they're talking about kurt schilling obviously pitching 
[00:15:00]  with a bloody ankle with his bloody ankle i don't know i think that's uh you know some some crap that  other uh other cities are uh making up there new york go socks go yeah exactly new york made it up  some other cities i don't acknowledge the yankees on this radio show ever ever i'm not one of these  dopey new yorkers as soon as their team is out they jump on the other new york team that always used  to piss me off i i used i used to see people that you would you know see it out and about wearing 
[00:15:30]  their mets hat and then the mets would get knocked out and all of a sudden the same person is wearing  yankee hat i'm like what are you doing just spinning around do you have any pride man have  some pride the only teams that boys at ibm are counting on you the only teams in new york that  are hardcore fans where they don't like you know jump on the bandwagon is like hockey ranger fans  and islander fans truly hate each other yeah truly hate each other but there are a lot of met fans and  i think a lot of yankee fans as well but it's worked in the yankees favor for the most part that as 
[00:16:00]  soon as one of those teams is out they they start rooting for the other one has there been a wacky  hat made yet where it's a half yankee you cut it in the middle and sew together a yankees and a  mets hat so you could just spin it around probably yeah uh well brooklyn ace uh is not gonna let me  slide on my whole esp thing uh yes brooklyn ace yeah you're making a fortune on your esp how's  you sit and i'll do it ouch well sir he was rooting for that he was certainly rooting for 
[00:16:30]  that one to go up by the way the sports curse also also uh covers stocks stock market my freaking  portfolio is just a disaster i got into a drug company because they were going to solve breast  cancer yes sure they were and uh i bought shares at four dollars i bought shares at eleven dollars  that stock is now at 90 cents nice and let me just uh put it this way you know how anthony likes  to gamble and plays plays a lot of money per hand well sure well i was i was uh i was all in on this

[00:19:30]  um fifth inning last night as he's throwing that topsy curvy freaking roller coaster ball  roller coaster here's the highlights of the fifth inning for uh for everybody you know i i really think  we might have to like really seriously look at this cd player because it's really effing annoying  show timing's everything on this show didn't they like replace that too i think they replaced that  and still giving us problems and any day now we'll give you the fifth inning i'm sweating in here uh it's 
[00:20:00]  a bit uncomfortable all right let's try this cd player because you know timing's everything so i'm  sure this is just as funny as it would have been a minute ago here's tim wakefield in the fifth inning  what happened 
[00:20:30]  what happened they just kept hitting it yeah there you go he doesn't even wind up when he  throws a pitch those stupid knuckleballers there's no like real wind up and and harumph to it they just  kind of step back a little and then step forward i what are you doing bowling stupid i would bet a lot  of money i think my uh how old is he now i guess he's nine my uh my nephew jd could throw faster than

[00:21:30]  we went down oh  whoa what are you swinging at wacky  and people are surprised that my nephew could throw really fast well look my sister's raising a  super kid it's a it's linger longer is it true huh is it true that uh you're for raising a super  kids i i think everyone should raise a super kid yes absolutely who would want a super kid  stupid everybody would hey uh i gotta tell you coke logic is on the same page as us um i i want to 
[00:22:00]  give him the credit that he's starting a new bit but actually it's kind of weird aunt and i were  we're talking about the exact same thing in the office before we got in here today yeah he checked  to see if we were still on uh wckg in chicago uh-huh so it's a new bit it's called ona road call  roll roll call uh sorry roll call right road call 57th street  sorry yes roll call um because what happened a couple weeks ago we did a show assuming we were 
[00:22:30]  on in detroit and pittsburgh and then we found out we felt like the biggest asses because this  company decided to leave us in the dark and we we found out after the fact that uh they took us off  detroit and pittsburgh they turned the detroit station into an all sports station and pittsburgh went  to back to some stupid format that i guess worked back in the day they changed the formats and then  uh you know we don't fit anymore that was embarrassing because that day was the big  detroit pittsburgh extravaganza show that we had promised for so long i know it was kind of 
[00:23:00]  embarrassing because that morning we were actually like giving pittsburgh props like hey we haven't  talked to pittsburgh in a while what's up pittsburgh how are you they weren't hearing and they weren't  hearing so so coke logic uh on the instant feedback he goes yep you're still on wckg this morning so we're  going to do a ona uh roll call so we know we're still broadcasting on wckg in chicago yeah and i  think the listeners could have fun with uh betting which which uh which freaking station is going to  drop us next yep so we want to hear from all the cities are we are we being heard on bcn right now 
[00:23:30]  are we being heard on ysp in chicago we need a roll call ysp in philly uh i said chicago yeah uh  in philly west palm that stupid freaking fifth inning i didn't get a lot of sleep last night if you  haven't figured that out yet uh yeah west palm i mean odds uh odds are that uh we're going to be  out in west palm beach or chicago in the very near future yeah but uh don't count philly out man i  mean they're they're trying hard to get rid of this show so they they could be the one they could they 
[00:24:00]  could they could come from behind and be the next freaking station that drops the opian anthony show  there's something really weird going on in philly we don't understand it i talked to uh somebody from  corporate yesterday and they're not saying that we're going to be gone but they weren't saying  that we're going to be around much longer and i'm looking at the latest ratings uh president steve  still kicking our ass but we're making some fine fine movement yeah it was uh it was very nice as a  matter of fact but uh you know a good sign is the fact they got a new pd that has decided not to 
[00:24:30]  communicate with us even though he said he would that that's never good that's never good and what  happens in radio you get a new pd and they want to bring in all their own uh people in there so they  can take you know complete credit for the success of a radio station so something's going on i have  more power over them and we would hate to lose philly i'll be completely honest with you we do not  want to go off ysp whatsoever some of these other stations you know it's part of the game we 
[00:25:00]  understand when you syndicate a radio show some are going to stick and some aren't  yep we understand that that's why we don't get completely freaked out but if we're if we're off  the air in boston or off the air in philly that's really really going to be a yeah that's definitely  a bummer man don't want that happening but something's going on with ysp in the op and anthony  show i i don't really feel the support i used to you know feel for uh for for for this show and i  don't know i don't know and we're we're kind of in the dark because no one's really communicating  with us down there so i i truly i've been doing radio since i was 18 i truly believe 
[00:25:30]  they're looking to go in another direction i really i believe that with all my heart which  is really frustrating because uh detroit we had horrific ratings the the show never really took  off in detroit for whatever reason okay but philly we're showing some nice growth so that'll that'll  be really tough yeah to deal with if we're if we're kicked off the air in uh philly yeah  then we're getting some good traction you know we know we have a ton of listeners down there we 
[00:26:00]  know we sold close to 10 000 tickets for uh opie and anthony comedy show let me tell you something  president steve are not selling 10 000 tickets for for a president steve comedy show i know for a fact  we have more listeners in philly than president steve and people would would say what huh what  but something that we don't really acknowledge much uh on on this side of the show we have a massive  audience on satellite in philly and a pretty good audience on ysp yep you put the two together it's 
[00:26:30]  not even close but it doesn't work that way unfortunately because we're we're working  with two separate companies that don't want to really acknowledge the other one whatsoever  we're very uh we're we're kind of ahead of our time as far as that's concerned they don't really  look at uh uh the the two mediums and put it together and then realize how many people you're  talking to except in cbs yeah they don't like to they don't like to look at each other in the hall  they just kind of both walk by yeah and i sat down with a sales guy and he said to me well maybe  there's a way to to take those extra listeners and get advertising dollars to 
[00:27:00]  hit your head on the desk when you're not out well no but they've just raised that point though  the bottom line is that that people want more bang for the buck if they're going to spend on  maybe if there's a way to incorporate both audiences and get them all on the same page that this way we  could take like certain contests and just the advertising dollars can be better  all right so well good news we're still on in uh chicago but i guess sean didn't hear that uh sean 
[00:27:30]  from chicago what's up yeah just uh letting y'all know you're still alive and good here  all right uh on wckg oh you might want to start figuring out another way to get the opian anthony  show in chicago i'm gonna be honest with you can we be like the big i've seen many different  variations of the fresh logo for for for chicago great i want the big i want to be like big headed  rocky dennis get us a map yeah get us a map and i want to pull pins out as we lose markets until i go 
[00:28:00]  to sleep and suffocate on my big fat head all right we're still on in uh chicago see there's some there's  some uh there's some uh listeners uh checking in from chicago all right thank you uh sean uh a check for  chicago brad grand rapids hey what's going on hey yeah yeah you're definitely on in uh the little  old town of grand rapids that's for sure all right wklq still has the opian anthony show on that's very 
[00:28:30]  good news good we uh we like we like grand rapids hey here's uh philly checking in charlie philly  listening on ysp what's up hey opi anthony jimmy what's up boys hey hey i just want to let you guys  know still on in ysp even though uh robin uh uh oh and they're getting kicked off of ysp kid chris is  taking her show is how reporting that too now oh he reported it yesterday apparently and kid chris played 
[00:29:00]  a little bit of that clip and it pissed chris off big time pissed him off because he don't want the  morning slot uh you know i mean i you know kid chris is a friend of ours as well which is kind of  strange because uh you know he's also friends with howard but it just works where we are friends with  kid chris he wants mornings every radio guy wants mornings i don't know why you'd want mornings  well especially if you're doing afternoons afternoons rule yeah it's a nice as far as the lifestyle goes  it is a nice uh time slot oh here it is howard said that their old station kitty rock is still in the 
[00:29:30]  toilet he said that cbs fired opi anthony years ago and then hired them back and put them on in  the mornings he said that uh they're second to last in the morning ratings that's so not effing true  but you know howard says what he wants and then people believe it for whatever reason by the way  no one heard this howard yeah exactly we're doing you a favor today you have to read it from somewhere  howard said that those guys i swear to god i had no idea this was said and he's talking about us in the  old days when howard talked about us i knew right away because people were actually hearing what he 
[00:30:00]  had to say yeah but i had no idea howard said this yesterday no clue um i have to read it off a blog  some blogger put this up and then we're reading it on a blog not because yeah because howard  broadcasted this to a ton of people and it got back to us i heard even the people that were listening  didn't hear it because they couldn't understand it with his dentures flapping around in his mouth  oh old mr ed teeth howard said that those guys claim that they make more money for xm than he 
[00:30:30]  does for serious but he finds that hard to believe oh my god you you want to play that card howard you  want to play that we make way more money for xm than you make for serious as far as the salary goes  we make crap no i'm not even talking about that we're way more profitable as a radio show on satellite  radio and howard do you want to argue that point howard they're stuck with a 100 million dollar 
[00:31:00]  contract every year you don't kind of like what i was talking about i was saying we make like crap  compared to what howard makes so if you take what howard makes and what we make uh we we could be  losing money for the uh company which we're not we're making money for them right we could be losing  money and still be outperforming him financially uh because they're paying him so much money it's a  so don't even don't even try it's amazing that he just spews his crap and people believe him it's 
[00:31:30]  not even close we're a much better deal for xm than howard is for serious one of the main reasons  they have to freaking merge the business plan yeah is is a train wreck because they're paying him a  100 million dollars a year oh trust me we want that contract and every guy in radio doesn't  god who wouldn't god bless him for getting it but to say that howard said that those guys claim that  they make more money for xm than he does for serious that is absolutely a fact yeah it is an  absolute fact if you factor in everything our contracts nowhere near his no disputing that 100 
[00:32:00]  million dollars a year is killing the company in the end and then he uh continues they don't get any  listeners and they don't have any ratings on regular radio howard said that z100 is the top  morning show and opie and anthony have been taking off a bunch of his old stations uh true uh when  howard was in syndication he was taking off a bunch of stations it's just the nature of freaking  syndication but every time he lost the station he didn't acknowledge it which may be a smart business 
[00:32:30]  i don't know we like to try to like you know tell like it is here which might be dumb on our part i  don't know uh they may be uh taking them off in philly so they could put kid chris on in the mornings  there because he's uh actually got ratings yeah kid chris got ratings and so do we  and they're very comparable by the way our ratings and kid chris's ratings on ysp are very comparable  yeah oh he's such a douche he's trying the old divide and conquer thing but no one's listening to  divide uh all right uh we have to take a break oh yeah andrea from uh pennsylvania what's up andrea 
[00:33:00]  hi hey i am a new listener i love you guys thank you um i listen on ysp for half my trip because i  listen to k-rock on the other half but i'm totally bummed out that that you guys might not be on the  station anymore well i like be awake in the morning i i had a long conversation with someone from  corporate yesterday and it's not looking good they didn't say that we are getting kicked off but they  weren't willing to commit that we're going to continue you know in the new year so i don't know 
[00:33:30]  where it's at i know the pd has decided not to communicate with us i know we had a really nice  dinner with david the gm down there but i guess that was just uh i don't know i don't know i don't  know what that was if you don't hear from somebody then you just don't know yeah so i don't know and  there's a lot of rumors out there there's a lot of buzz and uh it's not looking good i'm not gonna lie  to you and it's frustrating because our ratings are going up month after month down there 
[00:34:00]  so uh we have a long ways all right i mean the the problem is president steve has a they have a  massive lead and we're moving up but i guess we're not moving up fast enough for their taste  thank you andrea bye bye i would love to talk about it more but we do have to take a break  yes panicking huh dan is panicking i know we're really late today we rarely go this late on our  first break but uh we'll figure it out hey don't forget uh another chance to win a thousand  dollars today all right uh you have to listen for i forgot what sound we're playing oh i know 
[00:34:30]  what it is oh you got it of course i don't hear this sound between seven and seven thirty  all right the bellowing sea animal uh yes this sound it is this sound  there you go just be once yeah it'll be once but one more time  when you hear that between seven and seven thirty if you're the tenth caller at eight seven seven  two one two oh and a you're gonna win one thousand dollars it's opian anthony 
[00:35:00]  it's the opian anthony show  uh let's go to tim in tucson tim what's up buddy not much man can you hear us we lost you yeah we  lost you guys for a while out here what do you mean they're uh they delayed they had you on delay

[00:39:30]  you're gonna get hit by a mac truck yeah here's here's what you're gonna you're gonna do let's  let's just put it this way you know when you wake someone up you sometimes take your um pointer finger  and you poke them you go hey wake up wake up he's gonna do the same thing only he's gonna poke  uh in a a very uh precarious place  that's right yeah and and and he should probably make sure um his hands are clean afterwards if you're 
[00:40:00]  gonna be eating anything there you go anthony is brilliant i try all right dan uh it's time to wake  up your spouse or in this case wake up your wife okay i'm making my way down to the other end i'm  going to give you a three two one before contact all right be be quiet though and put the phone near  her mouth so we hear what she's saying she must sleep in a really weird way really  it's on speaker phones okay shh here we go 
[00:40:30]  waiting three in one  uh well well sometimes you get uh radio gold and sometimes it's just funny for the radio host because 
[00:41:00]  oops they got a dump out she said a naughty or actually she was just doing erox bit yeah i think what the f  yeah she was doing uh a what the f all you heard was her go dan what the f  what's going on dan oh not a whole lot i'm getting ready to go to work  yeah all right uh what is she doing now uh well she's smiling because she realizes she's on the radio 
[00:41:30]  show i told her about two weeks ago that i was up to this oh okay  listen to the show she don't get up early enough there you go you could really wake her up now just  by using well you know it's got a name for it there's a name for it we can't say anymore picture  making like a little captain morgan's mustache  that'll get her out of bed 
[00:42:00]  all right thank you dan  okay thank you  all right well  sometimes they work out uh real well and other times we have to describe what happened but uh her  reaction was was awesome but she cursed so  maybe we can clean it up and play it after the break  we can just beep that part out uh ian in chicago what's up  hey what's up all right hey man hey yin i don't think you guys are going anywhere from ckg  that's terrible i'm sorry that's terrible i'm sorry that's terrible i'm sorry 
[00:42:30]  oh did you see that jerk  oh really i hope you're not a betting man  hello exactly 
[00:43:00]  yeah hello exactly  really why do you think that uh ian  because ckg is like a classic rock thing and if they put fresh on  there would be like there'd be chaos here in chicago  what do you mean chaos what kind of chaos would there be in chicago  chaos would people take to the streets  i don't know about all that probably about as much  as since al sharpton showed up to town  uh i think chaos well when al sharpton came to town i think he had 12 people 
[00:43:30]  so yeah 12 people is chaos  really  al sharpton could really rally the troop  yeah all right ian well i hope you're right uh there you don't think we're going anywhere in chicago right  i hope not  i i think there's a i think uh it took a while for howard to get out here and i think it's taking the same time you know  i hope you're right  all right thank you ian 
[00:44:00]  i think we should just make a game out of this because uh it's either going to be west palm beach or chicago next  i honestly think it's going to be chicago that we uh lose before west palm beach and we thought we were losing west palm beach a year ago  but they're still searching for their uh next morning show so we're just a placeholder 
[00:44:30]  does anybody remember last night  that makes you feel good when you're doing radio that you're just a placeholder until they find another morning show  yeah  from some uh some city you've never heard of before  uh  let's say hi to tom in philly tom what's up  hey good morning guys  hey there tom  philly  hey thanks tom  don't go anywhere and uh  i just i just love listening to you guys in the morning  do not leave us in philly please  it's not up to us  something is amiss  something is 
[00:45:00]  something is going on at ysb  and i  we're pretty much out of the loop  which is really frustrating  really frustrating because we know we know we got an audience down there  we have no doubt in our minds  we love you guys in philly  tear those pigs up today after seven would you  all right thank you sir  uh let's go to matt in pennsylvania  matt what's up  hey you're still on the edge in buffalo  okay we're doing roll call  that's good to know  hey buffalo what's up  we're still recovering from the big uh  virus story this summer 
[00:45:30]  but you know we're  hey man that wasn't our fault  we wanted to go to buffalo with the comedy show  but uh for some reason it didn't work out  we figured we'd get uh  a little action from rochester  a little action from toronto  and uh and a little action from cleveland  we thought buffalo would have been perfect this summer  this is like war games  when they thought the nukes went off  yeah  and got the calls from the various cities  we're still here sir  we're still here  oh  oh  hello  sure  joshua  joshua  all right thank you  stupid computer learns 
[00:46:00]  and teaches them a lesson  how stupid  and don't forget to wear condoms  all right we got it  thank god for joshua  joshua rules  all right we gotta take another break  we gotta catch up  but uh when we get back  that's funny  when we get back  if you haven't heard  ellen degenerate crying yet  do you know why she was crying jimmy  i uh  you found out  i i think i know  all right don't give it away if you do  i'm not sure  you're not sure really  it had something to do with  like she had a dream  that there was a penis on her pillow 
[00:46:30]  that probably would get her to shed tears  yes  uh it's it's terrific  and i well we'll get into it  we'll get into it after the break  because uh we were watching it on tv yesterday  while we're still doing our radio show  and i'm like wow something really really bad happened  that was tragic  and then when i found out what she was crying over  i'm like wow  i thought it was the big casino or something  or someone close  well we'll get into it after the break  yeah 
[00:47:00]  and then uh trump going after angelina jolie  is pretty funny man  you know he's  he's going after all the tough targets these days  all the real tough ones  yeah  and uh we have a nice little article from vanity fair  to shut a certain broadcaster up  we'll do that next as well  it's opie and anthony  we have lots going on today  phones are lit  all right we'll make this really fast

[00:58:00]  and we couldn't hear the audio  because we were in the middle  of doing our radio show  and i point to these guys  and go i think something  really horrific happened  uh  obviously to ellen degeneres  someone in her family  is this a moment  where she's gonna like  tell everyone she's got cancer  did her mom  who she loves dearly  that's in the audience  every  every after  every time she does their show  is  did she die  yeah  something hard  something happened to her  life partner  what happened  to ellen degeneres  this is really  really serious  yeah 
[00:58:30]  and then when i found out  what it was about  i'm like oh my god  are you kidding me  are you kidding me  i don't know what it's about  all right let's  let's just play the audio here  this is ellen degeneres  from yesterday  everybody is talking  about this today  the video is everywhere  thank you very much  and right back at you  and i needed that today  um  uh  we're gonna edit  some of this out  um  are you  you know people say  i can hear the audience  dude i knew there had to be

[01:04:00]  and um  the film crew  was there  and somebody  forgot to bring  the oven mitts  for the dog  and normally  during a film  like that  they'll duct tape  oven mitts  to his paws  so i don't get  all scratched  up  that dewclaw  does tend  to dig in  how silly  does that look  on a dog  when he's  walking around  lifting his leg  he's like  goose stepping  with his front  legs  because he  doesn't know  what to do  with those  oven mitts  on his  little paws  all the other 
[01:04:30]  dogs are laughing  at him  he's like  yeah but  look what  i get to  do in a  couple minutes  we have  another animal  lover on the  phone here  oh  uh yes sir  what do you  got  i like  turtles  sounds happier  too  okay here's  more ellen  from a rescue  organization  here in  the area  and uh  i got it  neutered  and i got it  trained  and i paid  my vet  extra money  to take it  home to let  it sleep  in the bed  with him  that night  instead of  a cage 
[01:05:00]  i spent  three thousand  dollars on  this puppy  to acclimate  it to train  it to be  with our  cats  and it  just was  too much  energy  and too  rambunctious  my hairdresser  who i see  every single  day  she and her  husband  have two  little girls  11 and 12  years old  they were just  looking for a  puppy  they have a  dog  and they said  we love  iggy  can we have  iggy  iggy  has been  with them  for two  weeks  i get  updates  every single  day  and pictures  every day  of how  happy  iggy  is  all right  so she  misses the  dog  what's  the big 
[01:05:30]  deal  the obsessive  relationship  with her  and iggy  is making  me physically  ill  yeah  do you need  pictures  every day  and updates  leave the  family alone  i heard she  got the  dog from  jack jack  same place  steve from  bayshore  she got the  dog from  jack jack  the cat  handed over  a dog  yeah  wow  pardon  pardon  pardon  no hit  yourself on  the head  with a  shovel  please  all right  feel better  all right  more sound  effects  yeah  she got  iggy 
[01:06:00]  um  she's not  a horse  and she had  to tell  everyone that  she spent  three thousand  dollars  guess what  multi-millionaire  that's like  a couple  pennies  that's nothing  stop with uh  making people  feel bad for you  because you spent  three thousand dollars  on a dog  here's her pets  all right  and apparently her  stupid vet who has  a wife and children  to go home to  uh she threw her  hollywood money at him  and said could you  bring him home  and he said yes  and took three grand  and still left  faggoty iggy in a cage  yeah 
[01:06:30]  what's he gonna do  tell her  yeah i know  like oh could you  take the dog  oh god  i don't want  to take the dog  but i have to  because it's ellen  well it gets better  so the hairdresser  and the family  have iggy  and the kids  are enjoying  iggy  yeah  everything is  good with  iggy  and ellen's  getting her  updates  her pictures  every day  pictures every day  of how happy  iggy is  and how much  their daughters  love iggy  the organization  contacted me  yesterday  and said  how's iggy  and i told  them the truth  i didn't lie  i said  iggy has a 
[01:07:00]  great home  well i guess  i signed a piece  of paper  that says  if i can't  keep iggy  it goes back  to the rescue  organization  oh  which is not  someone's home  which is not  a family  these two little  girls had bonded  to the dog  i thought i did  a good thing  i tried to find  a loving home  for the dog  because i couldn't  keep it  i was trying  to do a good  thing  and because i  did it wrong  these people  went and took  that dog  out of their  home  and took it  away from  those kids  and i feel  totally responsible  for it  and i'm so  sorry 
[01:07:30]  and i'm  begging them  look i love  animals  i really do  in the end  it might not  sound like it  but holy  ass  here's a  hold of  yourself  here's my  issue here  why can't  the rescue  place took it  back  why can't  the family  that had  iggy  just follow  the rescue  person that  took the dog  go back there  and say  alright we'd like  to adopt  that dog 
[01:08:00]  and if it  costs extra  money  ellen will  foot the  bill  she seems  a little  upset about  it  she'd be  able to  like  cough up  another  three g's  and what  dummies at  the rescue  organization  yeah yeah  you gotta say  they're dummies  too  what idiots  like the amount  of money she  could throw  at the organization  and i just  it's just  stupid  i guess they'd  rather just  gas it  i think it's  a technicality  of course the  dog's going  back to the  family  of course  now it  has to  of course  the outrage 
[01:08:30]  that this  will cause  a crying  lesbian on  television  gets a lot  of sympathy  well we learned  from the  michael vick case  that we care  more about  animals than  human beings  so just the  outrage that's  going to happen  starting today  trust me that  family will get  their dummy  that was the  problem it was  the vick family  they've given  the dogs  yeah they looked  up the family  and it was  michael  realized there  was a distant  relative of  michael vick  and the three  thousand dollars  she lost  betting on the  pit bull  and she 
[01:09:00]  couldn't believe  that little  fruity iggy  actually pulled  it out  she should have  bet on the  scalded beagle  there's a couple  of dog stories  in the news  today  all right  listen  here's the  rest of the  clip  Ellen DeGeneres  everyone  and I'm begging  them to give  that dog  back to that  family  I just  I just want  the family  to have  the dog  it's not  their fault  it's my fault  oh my  I shouldn't  have given  the dog away  just please  bring the dog  back  to those little  girls  I'm sorry  I didn't call

[01:13:30]  Florida  Iggy dropping  little pellets all  over the rug  duties  all right it's  Opie and Anthony  we'll talk to the  contest pigs while  you listen to these  messages  it's a very busy  day on the Opie and  Anthony show  yeah we got a great  story here in New  York some lady  went to take care of  business I love how  they talk about it in  the paper I got to  find it actually  and went into her  bathroom started doing  her thing and for 
[01:14:00]  some reason look behind  or maybe the water  started moving or  something I don't know  and she found a  seven-foot python  wow in her bowl  what's her diet  but I love the paper  forget the monsters  under the bed there  really are slithery  creatures lurking in  the pipes oh that's  what they said  nature's call I like  when they say nature's  call forced Nadege  Bernacci to the dark 
[01:14:30]  bathroom in her  cobble hill Brooklyn  apartment in the wee  hours of Monday  morning while  washing her hands  she glanced back at  the toilet okay so  she was already all  right to find a  seven-foot-long  python staring back at  her oh my god it was  in the in the plumbing  did it come out of the  toilet or I don't know  they don't really  refuge in the toilet  when I brush my teeth I'm  looking over my shoulder  she said and when she  goes to the bathroom at  night she uses her  daughter's training  toilet that's what she 
[01:15:00]  does now because of this  incident because she's  scared now so she uses a  little pan yeah the  little uh the potty yeah  the training toilet that  has nothing to do with the  real toilet you know so  yeah and then you got to  empty it out yeah was the  snake dead or alive it was  alive man she slammed down  the lid put a heavy box  on top of it and began  calling city agencies how  fat is she no one  believed her but finally  someone came over and 
[01:15:30]  they captured the serpent  what are they going to do  with it besides wash it  imagine putting that on  your shoulder and getting  a photo taken it's like  there's rust all over your  back here's your answer  Jimmy nobody knows where  the snake came from or how  it made its way up three  stories of piping but a  first floor tenant in the  four-story Tiffany place  walk-up report seeing the  creature slithering down the  basement steps eight days  earlier so so it really did  get into the pipes I don't  know how it could get in the  plumbing that doesn't make 
[01:16:00]  much sense I could see if  maybe there was a space  between the toilet plumbing  and the floor maybe a crack  that it climbed up that pipe  and then got in there and  then crawled into the toilet  but crawling through the  toilet they got to breathe  it's not a fish I pick up  the love of God I pick up  this book every once in a  while to read about rats the  whole book about rats and  how they came to America and  how very good and and how  they've completely taken over  most US cities is especially 
[01:16:30]  New York they say within 10  feet at any given time you're  10 feet from a rat yeah and  not only are you takes that  not only are you 10 feet from  a rat they're also doing a  little that effing yeah because  that's all they do is eat and  eff that they chew through  stuff and eff that's what  rats more rats and they in this  book they swear that they that  they do come up through the  toilets and even if you have the  lid down these these these nasty 
[01:17:00]  nasty creatures get from the  sewer they swear toilet they swear  this is how they get into some of  the apartments it does happen  how creepy is that hold their  breath I don't know lucky maybe  at night with his less flushing  going on quick I don't know we  got to get an expert on the line  that is Ronnie being expert on  rats I don't know kind of get  things very large wrap with the I  don't know they swear in this  book that you know I'm not saying  it's not possible and they also  say how they're like bodies could 
[01:17:30]  collapse in on itself to squeeze  through something that is as small  as like a I've seen videos of them  getting under doorways that are just  you couldn't imagine a piece of  paper sliding under there and they  take their mushy little bones right  right and they just squish them down  and slide right under the door yeah  uh creepy little creature Jimmy had  more on the Ellen DeGeneres thing as  we went to break by the way I was  we were just talking it was it's  amazing to me how stupid that animal  control center is like yeah the 
[01:18:00]  shelter or whatever it is what dummy  it's like what company man or woman  what like civil service employee  this attitude that we've all dealt  with did they have to did she have to  talk to that would I'm not saying  all right Ellen's famous she deserves  better privileges but I'm sure she  knows a better group of people yeah  any idiot at the animal rescue center  so yeah she knows a better group of  people to give a puppy to then then  they do and and the puppy just sitting 
[01:18:30]  at this animal place instead of in a  home and I'm sure that if it was a  technicality they said look you have to  come down bring the dog we'll sign it  right over it would have been done but  they didn't do that it was well nope  sorry you got sorry not like child  services you know it's a it's a puppy  and so yeah someone was obviously on a  power trip you broke the rules yeah yeah  even though their whole goal is to get  these animals in loving families hands  I'll show her yeah and now she's  begging on national television that 
[01:19:00]  looks great for the animal rescue  people that's good yeah Ellen just  seems like a nice lady she's a nice  lady yeah she overreacted a little bit  though I mean come on she's  menopausing of course she doesn't look  like she's a emotional wreck all right  back to the joke hot flashes of course  we only give you a little peek that  we're human and then we have to go  back to the joke well I felt empathy  for her because it's like you know you  try to do the right thing I  understand you broke the rules but  can't they ever can't they ever just  cut through paperwork and tape and  go all right just bring the dog we'll  sign you just go just come down now 
[01:19:30]  let us see the home can't they ever  just do that you think they did like  an Ilion Gonzalez or whatever that  kid's name is with the guns they came  with the guns a blazing give us Iggy I'd  love to see the scene where the kids  crying  just change its name instantly right  that's right to number 432 they had to  mace the parents and one of the kids and  then grab Iggy by the throat like a  pitbull throat grabber and then drag it  out screaming they take it to a room 
[01:20:00]  and then go Iggy and when it answers  they smack it in the face your name is  Iggy Fido Pam your name is Fido let's  let's say hi to he was probably dropping  little sad nervous pellets all the way  back to the shelter yeah so it's like in  the marathon man when Dustin Hoffman gets  away and then the guy picks him up and  goes stay down and that makes him duck  and he drives his circles and brings him  right back yeah right back where he was  Iggy will never trust again the little  girls will get him back and they'll go to  pet Iggy and he'll just feel scared do

[01:26:00]  him to the curb so he's he's turning into a  problem looks like hey wait you know  who's this guy Macintosh man Justin Long  does anyone know who he is yeah that's  uh I was in die hard all right he did he  did the Apple commercials yeah the Apple  commercial guy that's how I know sure  that's right he was yeah oh that's great  he was in die hard and they film has  Macintosh man yeah Sherrod's got his arm  around this guy and it just you've never  seen a drunker man really he looks loaded 
[01:26:30]  he looks like right now he's just been he's  been yapping for an hour at that guy the  guy's like there's a large black man with  his arm around me all right I'm a  frightened shut up hey we got more info  on the Ellen situation from Jennifer in  Buffalo she writes I read up on the Ellen  s and apparently they have some rule  against letting families with small  children adopt small dogs for the dogs  protection so they might not get Iggy  back oh so they like give it to Ellen so  Ellen of course has no kids as far as I 
[01:27:00]  write right Ellen doesn't have kids I  don't think so no there's no kids there  so then they they found out that Iggy  went to a family with kids and they could  be held liable probably if one of the  kids get eaten for the kids out there by  the way oh you can't make no you can't  make true you can't make kids with two  donuts right no matter how many times you  slam them together I'm gonna do a sex  lessons for kids from now on yeah two  donuts don't make a kid nope no don't 
[01:27:30]  make a huge mess that's all you get from  two donuts you need a crawler in there  slam two truck tires together and that's  all you get oh wow so if you think that's  the animal shelter wow so this is that  can get sued now that now the animal  shelters in a tough position because I'm  also reading there's a lot of death  threats happening because you know we  love animals in this country way more 
[01:28:00]  than we love human beings good they  should get so they're getting the death  threats but they have a rule they're  trying to protect the dog so they don't  give the small dogs to the the the  families with kids because they can  squish the dog and kill them okay it's a  little yip-yip dog one of those like  two pounders or something like that good  I'm glad they're getting death threats  but they have no problem man they have  no problem giving big dogs to families  with kids and then that's another  problem is it a little dog it has to be  yes it has to be yeah yes yeah then 
[01:28:30]  that's not different than a pit bull  huh of course of course it's different  than like a pit bull we're giving it to  a little family gonna bite the heads  off the kids yeah I give the stupid  dog back just what jerk but they can't  make the exception now because it's  public but she probably begged enough  off and now she's had to go I'm sure  she was begging crime please god they  just could they just couldn't bend the  rules yeah at least it got Ellen crying  it's a good clip yes good point we got 
[01:29:00]  a little replay action here we're doing  wake up your spouse on Wednesday so far  we got one unfortunately what's  happening today all the concert pigs are  like killing our phone lines every day so  it makes it tougher for some of these  people to get in with their wake up your  spouse ideas so it's kind of  frustrating but we got one so far today  and the lady cursed so we kind of  cleaned it up so you can hear what  happened hopefully that hopefully this  explains what what was going on I think  it's a shorter version three oh wow it's  that short geez are you kidding me what 
[01:29:30]  am I gonna do with that microphone Eric  what am I gonna do with that I asked  him to shorten the clip I didn't realize  he shortened it that much there's no  setup oh boy I don't want to play the  long version all right I know how about  they how about they just reassured and  we play the next bird all right we'll do  that how about that Eric well Eric  please Iraq please we're under the gun  we're feeling a lot of stress and  pressure these days you gotta have been  listening to me I did listen no you did 
[01:30:00]  it yes I did and I what I said what I  said I said you didn't want the whole  setup no I wanted a shortened version of  the phone call I said so the shortened  version is seven seconds that's what he  handed to me and no no Iraq I'm gonna  start taping my conversations off air  because trust me I'm rain man when it  comes to this crap it's one of my  problems I said take the call clean it  up a little bit shorten it and then  bleep out the curse that's exactly what  I said and I guarantee people in this  room will back me up so what I got now is 
[01:30:30]  the really long original call and the  short call which is seven seconds that  doesn't explain anything how long is the  original call it's over two minutes well  that's a shortening wow well you tell  someone to shorten it they don't mess  around three two one clip done I said  concert pig again holy crap why why do I  keep saying concert pig because a lot of  because he rocks got y'all distracted right  with his incompetence I never got over 
[01:31:00]  singing I know this was out of my  control oh I explained it a while ago  when the call originally happened that  we needed this per opie's instruction  Tim didn't do it till just now don't say  per by the way he rocks but you  understand if I tell you that it is your  responsibility I don't care who you have  do it when it's handed back to me I  assume that it was done correctly when  you delegate responsibility you are the  one responsible right for who you 
[01:31:30]  delegated it to and the final product  I don't even know who Tim is who exactly  Tim exactly the boo radley of k-rock just a  big lummox stands there so now we got a  you know just all right listen now I'm  saying it on air take the original clip  shorten it up so it's not like two  minutes long Tim's in studio now oh boy  Tim he said give me the whole call and  give me a short version of it he didn't 
[01:32:00]  say clean it up and make it I thought you  just wanted the part there you go yes I  did say that to you because when I asked  you originally in the I am here about it  and then I went back to the studio and  asked you said oh no I didn't pull it and  I said it's got to be a shortened version  of the call and it has to be beeped  because there's a curse in it right you  said okay and then I came back in here  and then you handed me the disc up and I  did exactly what you asked cares what in  said shut up who cares I think what we 
[01:32:30]  have here is a failure to communicate  yeah you didn't communicate what I  communicated to you Iraq that's what it  comes down to it does Iraq feel that he  didn't get enough information as to how  short you wanted it tie me a sheepshank  didn't tell me how short you wanted it  yes is that the problem you felt like  you weren't given enough information  microphone I can be kidding so what's the  problem Iraq no why do you feel like  you're being persecuted persecuted here 
[01:33:00]  unjustly comment Iraq come I don't know  how we'll shorten the call down and make  sure it's clean means seven seconds of  the call I understand not the whole full  thing but have a little setup before the  actual phone call I didn't do the edit  but I had to delegate it so I guess it is  my responsibility that the call was edited  did you then listen to it beforehand no  because he walked in and oh see so it  went from his hands to right into the 
[01:33:30]  machine for on the air yeah see is that  good no in the long run basically the  general gave the captain an order the  captain gave it to a private and now the  captain wants to back out and say to the  general hey private's fault but now  someone's saying it's my responsibility  because I trusted Iraq and I guess that  person is as is accurate Wow now I look  like a dummy because you didn't do it  right now another demerit you blame you  blame Tim I blame you I can directly 
[01:34:00]  point out how you cost us Detroit crap  flows down my friend let's go to  Beatrice Beatrice you listen they hate  sloppy radio in Detroit Beatrice you  listen to the Opie and Anthony show  hello is this Ollie or Anthony what  Ollie yeah it's Ollie what's up hey how  you doing I'm I'm calling about the  contest and you listen to the Ollie and  Anthony show my grandson actually turned me

[01:37:00]  Wednesday might be too late to get new ones  in now unfortunately yeah the uh the prize pigs the  contest pigs not arena not the concert pigs  although people are enjoying every time I  say concert pig I think honestly I think  concert pig because of uh the time we went and  saw kiss in 1998 oh not the same audience from  their heyday that's all I'm saying  so yeah now it's too late because a lot of the  people are up they're awake right right so uh this 
[01:37:30]  came in an hour ago it's uh the only one we got  today but uh next next week we'll do it again and  we'll see what uh comes in but uh this is what  uh happened a little while ago Dan uh yeah you  gotta be careful uh with how you describe what  you're doing how you describe this okay I got you I'll  be careful I am going to just gently poke my  girlfriend let's let's just put it this way he's  gonna poke uh in a a very uh precarious place she must 
[01:38:00]  sleep in a really weird way really it's on speaker  phones okay three two one man what the oh and there you go  see a quick highlight quick highlight that's all that was so  long Jesus it just went on and on now we'll take you in the  show yeah clip should have been shorter you have the other  version right there give me that from where I'm sitting I 
[01:38:30]  can never see Eric's face all I see is his hat and his  eyes yep well I can't see his nose or his mouth just his  hat this is what caused the argument see now we bring in  yeah now I want to hear what the clip was that you were  originally given that one is perfect you know someone's  waking up their wife yep you know what they're gonna do  exactly and then you get the big reaction the pay perfect you  don't get all that dead air as he's setting up the phone and  babbling about nothing because he's on the radio exactly um  and uh this is what eric thought I wanted technically because you 
[01:39:00]  told Tim and this is what Tim handed in three  and one  man what the  all right listen what is that what is that if you don't know the  setup is that what is that if you don't know the setup it could be a  shuttle launch I don't let that a three two one right exactly and  then one of the uh female passengers was groped  what I got to uh communicate from why in the shuttle 
[01:39:30]  yes uh yes somebody from uh inside the walls  I don't know I swear to god I'm usually pretty good at this stuff I  don't know if the guy's uh joking or if he's serious I have no idea I  swear to god if you weren't listening earlier there's uh there's uh strong  rumors that uh they might be thinking about making a change in uh Philly and  taking us off the air at YSP and we're doing good over there with the 
[01:40:00]  latest what happened the latest whatever ratings uh we did good we're  moving up we still have a ways to go to catch press and Steve but we we are  convinced that we can take them yeah but uh so this guy uh from inside the  walls and I really don't know if he's joking we discussed the whole Philly  thing earlier so that's why we say linger longer please uh he writes  oh as your hugest fan in Philly it is sad to see you guys being hustled out the  door in spite of gaining momentum with the newfangled uh ratings let's just say 
[01:40:30]  that but like you say there is some agenda down here that even we don't know  about I think I'm allowed to share your success in the ratings but you never  know if you don't hear from me again I have been killed by agents of Kid Chris  to the untrained eye it sure looks like Rock is killing your show and kids  what does that mean like the last part obviously was like he's joking yeah but  is there stuff in there that's true I'm telling you this is what's like keeping 
[01:41:00]  me up at night like what the F is going on in Philly I have no idea I just uh  uh there's no communication with the people down there all right except cryptic  messages that's a cryptic message yeah look at this Ellen stories all over the  news now her crying face is really just gonna get everybody up in arms at at 
[01:41:30]  whatever animal place that was of course oh is that gonna do it she didn't even  say it on the air does she she's beloved and she's not just with she's  blubbering on camera yeah blubbering she's a blubbering disaster a little dab your  eyes with a tissue you're choking up she was blubbering  begging there she's just a nice lady yeah except when I asked for a picture 
[01:42:00]  with her then oh that's right but aside from that she was busy out in Vegas she  was a little bitch to you saw her too recently me and Jonathan were driving  after I did Leno I was on the same lot as Ellen yeah we're driving by and she  was standing with a massive bodyguard and my manager's nuts he's like Jim go get a  picture I like that yeah right my manager's so codependent like I get angry  very a lot and he was panicked when I get angry and I start I'm not screaming  at him I'm just like why won't they yeah and he's always like Jim Jim Jim Jim Jim  Jim he just panics I'm like let me be angry you know you should do you should 
[01:42:30]  put mittens on your ears and paint your nose black and go and then she'll tap you  on the head and then you could ask for an autograph oh yes cuz she likes little  puppies I wish I would have known this situation back then I would have screamed  out the window hey if you take a picture with me I'll get Iggy back man just  for never to talk to her again she went start crying hey we might have another one let's  say hi to Leanne in Virginia Leanne what's up today I'm about to wake up my spouse oh  you want to wake up my spouse you want to wake up your spouse shut up I know that

[01:46:00]  Trump's got a new book out so uh he's spewing again what's it called screw everyone yeah the guy  is on this uh rampage now because he had such success with the Rosie O'Donnell thing that he now feels  he could just go out and start bitching about people and it's gonna get him uh in the news and it does  yeah it sure does boy the Donald's on a tear oh oh I kind of uh CNN had me laughing pretty hard 
[01:46:30]  last night because they were playing this clip and you know they have to like have pictures along  with the clip and I guess Donald Trump did this on Larry King and uh so they go to the uh the video  and they show Angelina Jolie yeah like take caring taking care of of of something let's just call it  something from a third world uh you know country oh she just she searches the globe for children that uh 
[01:47:00]  that uh need a care like uh she's doing a lot she truly is a gal she truly is a you know a  humanitarian to the point where Brad Pitt's like enough already but he's too scared to say anything  that's obvious too scared he absolutely is too scared to say look Angelina Jolie enough stop you  think he calls her by a first and last name like that yeah okay why would he be scared though if he  could just jump out and like just get any chick I don't know I don't know I think there's uh I don't  know yeah it's a good situation I think he's into having a controlling woman or something something's 
[01:47:30]  going on there oh you think if you read about Brad Pitt and just his interviews it it doesn't seem  like this is the type of this is the guy that wants to be with a humanitarian adopting things from  all over the world yeah maybe one maybe two maybe but he's got like the like he got holding hands  with them they're walking around all over the place you never see him without the kids like when  when the hell do they have any uh any alone time it's something we talk about on the show all the 
[01:48:00]  time I think it's the power of the yeah well hers is like uh hypnotic I guess the power of the  these guys get tattoos of her name on you he got sucked in walk around with vials of blood  around each other's neck she was doing that with billy bob thornton for a while he literally got  sucked in oh yeah she's gonna be wonderful in bed he got sucked in man you know and she's got the  the super our little sex expert from yesterday's uh afternoon's show was um is all over the place 
[01:48:30]  the xm show yes yeah she's on going on she's on everywhere so um you know so uh donald trump had  this to say about angelina jolie and angelina jolie and cnn as uh donald was babbling uh is showing  like i said video of her somewhere that i i don't even recognize taking care of space children like  alien kids at this point pretty much pretty much angelina jolie is sort of amazing because everyone  thinks she's like this great beauty and i'm not saying she's an unattractive woman but she's not 
[01:49:00]  a great beauty by any stretch of the imagination and now she's like a representative of the united  nations and world peace and hunger and all of this yeah and all right who else gets fired today  seriously oh i thought that's where the clip ended who else gets fired today oh boy we're cleaning house  oh no we are so cleaning house oh no i thought the clip ended there and we were going to comment i  thought it was an awkward out but um oh and there it goes it just flew against the window someone's in 
[01:49:30]  trouble it is kind of look i've teased angelina jolie i like to smash her too but when you're a  billionaire like trump is and i'm looking at i'm sure he made he's made some donations yeah but you got  to give her credit she is grabbing a bunch of things from wherever there's a civil war  you know wherever they don't believe in circumcision she'll show up and try to adopt something 
[01:50:00]  you know if it's a kid a highway anything you know a tumbleweed she'll take something back and name it  but she is look she's doing good things you can't as much as i'd like to trash her more you know you  can't like to know with adopting kids you know what it is too i'd love to know what her motivation is for  this like there are some people that are a little too motivated to do this stuff she's one of them  i would love to say it's because she's such a caring giving person and i don't know perhaps that is the 
[01:50:30]  reason but i always think it's something's lacking in your life that you have to do something like  that to just commit your life to to doing that and she seems like a very a person that does things  on a whim and then it lasts for a few years and then she gets like yeah because remember her and  billy bob with the tats of each other's names all over themselves and and the uh like i said the  vial of blood they would wear or of each other's blood around their neck they were seen together  constantly it was like this big thing and then all of a sudden that just went away i want to do the 
[01:51:00]  same thing with my girlfriend but i want to extract the blood with my fist against her teeth  with a knife just a good fat lip god i had an awful sexual performance last night oh no  terrible were you bad do you rate yourself on every um occurrence yeah i was bad or horrible  i was atrocious last night what a trooper she is what was the problem yeah what's just my lack of  prowess i was tired i just suck was uh was everything um completely functional what was everything 
[01:51:30]  completely functional well what were you like at uh running at uh 70 percent or um i was trying to i  was trying to pogo stick on a noodle oh my god i should just be shot through the face i really should  be and what did she say it's okay that she pat you just awful just awful like what what did she say  just loving words like what it was fine it's okay it's good it wasn't good you've just here's what it 
[01:52:00]  is thank you mother you've just watched your fat son strike out with the bases loaded and you're  saying it's okay you swung hard there's nothing greater than running at a hundred percent where  things happen and and um uh it's it's there's no effort when you're running like below sixty percent  it's almost like picture you ever have the string come out of your sweatpants and you're trying to put 
[01:52:30]  the string back through your sweatpants you know how difficult that is the pushing around the edge  of the string and the shoving and it just it's not quite working oh great example that is just horrid  could be the best example of that ever but when you're running a hundred percent you could take it  and throw it and it comes flying out the other side yeah that's exactly what it was and she just  says it's it's fine it's okay no but i i had a good time and she's just a true time where'd you go 
[01:53:00]  the amusement park she must really have fun she does really love you and that even makes me sicker  it's that she's speaking out of love and not out of animal lust almost almost like like it makes me  love her but it's almost like when you know someone is just speaking out of love you just feel like a  schlub yeah suck can you just have like regular sex yeah yeah or does something have to be going on  that's a little little unusual or different i don't know i don't know what's wrong with me  you know what uh i gotta i gotta credit uh uh the gym for um really helping out my i realized my 
[01:53:30]  endurance was for crap i couldn't hold myself up on one arm for a while which is you know it's pretty  important you need some good upper body strength if you're really gonna go to town you know and uh  if if your body is in a lot of motion for any period of time uh after like a couple after not  even a minute it was like oh my god i can't hold myself up oh my god i'm winded it's just awful 
[01:54:00]  yeah are you just collapsing it's like oh now though you know you go to you go to the gym for like  between like eight months and a year you're in that zone like that you realize holy jeez was my  endurance for crap because then you just you're like wow you're standing up doing the old whole  you're doing the old i don't even need a bed just hey i can hold that weight up come here kind of 
[01:54:30]  good hands give a good grip all of a sudden you're doing one arm push-ups that's it you gotta call the  can the drywall guy in because you just rammed up against the spackled wall that's some good  stuff i could never do that standing up no no why easier for me to do it head spinning on a  cardboard 1985 with old rap music playing i certainly couldn't i cannot ever have sex anywhere 
[01:55:00]  in the bed yeah yeah what about standing up like next to the bed no it doesn't matter what i'm  like is there some uh some uh situations that could happen oh yeah where where the girl is still  in the bed and you're kind of outside the bed with your feet on the floor i probably i just get a  message from my sister dawn it says ew yeah i uh wonderful i didn't want to blow up your spot but  i'm with dawn too i figured someone out there would find this hot and sexy well no but me and jim are 
[01:55:30]  sitting there like i'm being very clinical about it nobody wants to think of virile anthony yeah no yes  potent and being virile i would i just want to say just potent and full of poison that needs to  get rid of poison i'm just saying that the endurance is very important right we you know you don't want  to get we understand by the way winded by the way i didn't talk for a while there and dave you made  me laugh thank you dave from manhattan he writes is opie off beating the help 
[01:56:00]  just feeling a little pressure lately what can i tell you we're a pretty honest show we we don't  hide much um so the donald trump thing though i mean it was getting to the good part where where he  he talked about how you know angelina jolie was making out with her own brother and having  yeah before the oscars and bragging about it on live tv and for some reason that that uh shouldn't  go hand in hand with being a humanitarian right the hell does he care for that's what i want it but 
[01:56:30]  without the clip it's hard to have that discussion jimmy god almighty you're a real estate guy what  are you what are you scrupulous i know what has he been through in his past i like the fact that he's he's  he's there's every time you hear like is there a trunk a trump bankruptcy yeah during tomorrow and  he's building new buildings i mean you gotta love him he finds figures out some way to screw someone  else is that what he's doing brilliant guy yeah hey uh rory from boston has a very good uh question  by the way we're gonna be at the halloween party a week from friday rory hope you're going uh what's 
[01:57:00]  up i'm trying to uh score tickets on touch and rich for that but uh it's not working out for me  yeah they got a very popular show it's tough to get uh through to those guys i don't know why they  didn't give us a few tickets just to throw around hey dave send us some tickets to give away  uh what rory they said it was uh too big that you guys are giving out too many prizes that's why  they can't give them out oh we all right so what do you got rory um yeah i was just wondering uh what  you guys are gonna do when some uh some big guy wakes up and goes mike tyson on his wife and throws 
[01:57:30]  up to a plate glass window well that's uh what we're hoping for with this wake up your uh after all the  laughter yeah well i could explain it uh rory um we we take no responsibility you ever see  of course you've seen caddyshack right absolutely remember when um the priest gets like uh hit by  lightning on the green of course he does do you remember yeah of course i remember that do you  remember and you know how like uh bill murray just kind of puts the golf bag down and just kind of 
[01:58:00]  skulks away sneaks away like like he like he wasn't there yep that's kind of like what we would do  we would kind of just like hang up on like slowly hang up and not acknowledge we took the call and  just move on that's that's what we do we've we've done that in the past with this show no responsibility  all right rory you guys killed in manfield by the way oh thank you yeah that was another uh fine  virus show so thank you sir absolutely all right guys take it easy all right uh john in philly what's 
[01:58:30]  up yo uh good morning guys hey john um jimmy you killed saturday night too by the way thank you i  just wanted to comment on i'm from philly i listen every morning uh i got like an hour long commute in  the morning and if you guys get canceled down here and i have to listen to preston and steve every  morning i'm gonna kill myself you won't have to listen to preston and steve if we get canceled just  grab back some or or could you kill yourself before they officially take us off because that could 
[01:59:00]  help the ratings that would kind of be good yeah you could sacrifice yourself for the good of the  show that would be kind of cool i suppose i could do that all right thank you john all right guys all  right thank you yeah i don't want to just tell the people you know pick up an xm i want to succeed on  f and ysp so do i but all right off if we're off i'm not gonna sit here casually going ah well just  listen to us on xm no i want to succeed on ysp we're heading in the right direction well that makes  it sound like i'm saying that casually i'm not i'm just yes you i heard you say that jimmy but if 
[01:59:30]  it happens yeah i know if it happens i you know there's gonna be a lot of outrage and then we try  to find uh well i'm outraged we'll say that for bob i just hate to start over again somewhere else  uh jeremy in wyoming what's up hey anthony is one of my heroes i want to hear more about  feral anthony making the little jewish neighbors wake up in the middle of the night with screams  of ecstasy okay now you've convinced me i should just shut up about it it took jeremy's call from 
[02:00:00]  wyoming we just don't want to think that you were getting tuckered out i guess i think that's what  bothered me well that's that was a while ago i understand you've been at the gym for eight oh you're  a different person but we don't want to think of anthony getting old tuckered out and collapsing  no i wasn't a collapse jesus it was just you know i i realized i had to pace myself a little more  and that was just being sheerly out of shape i understand so it didn't have any muscle tone 
[02:00:30]  i completely understand very skinny but i didn't have any muscle tone and you show off your muscles  now which is very impressive too oh i'm just such a uh uh yeah anthony likes to show off his biceps  every once in a while i i have to why because i i for for years i just heard that um i um i had aids  that's what people would say it's like jeez eat a sandwich when you got aids  all right uh we got the pope uh being seen in a fire photo which is so obviously like 
[02:01:00]  some weird photoshop or some kind of program yeah who's buying this crap we'll get into that  religious nuts religious dopes the same ones that see virgin mary and a toast get a hold  yeah that's where she's gonna show up 200 000 dead in a tsunami no one shows up but there's a fire in  a shrub somewhere where somebody drops their blueberries on the floor and a fat man steps on  look it's the virgin mary yeah yeah get the police tape 
[02:01:30]  and that's stupid toast yeah they went for all kinds of money on that's ridiculous but we got a  new one we'll talk about that next and also uh if you guys want mornings a bit of the day  big girls uh eat fries instead of big girls don't cry wait oh god and the reason we're playing this  today because it follows uh the format that you hate where they try to squeeze too many words in  oh they shoehorn the words in shoehorn thank you yeah so we'll uh we'll get that on too before we  get out of here it's opian anthony we still got lots to do it's the opian anthony show uh we're 
[02:02:00]  gonna play what did we learn on the opian anthony show in a few minutes 877-212-ON-A also really fast  don't forget tomorrow sometime between 7 and 7 30 we're gonna play this sound right here  goodness gracious goodness gracious when you hear that between 7 and 7 30 tomorrow and you're the  10th caller you will win $1,000 courtesy of the opian anthony show tell your friends we're doing 
[02:02:30]  this we don't care if we get a few prize pigs listening for a while of course because we know  some will be uh converted into listeners and good radio and those sounds are on onaradio.com every  day so if you miss part of the show and you don't know what the sound you need to listen for you  go there and there's a little link to the sound okay right uh i gotta drop oh did you yeah uh in  jeans it's not as bad as when you're wearing like nice pants when you're out to dinner and you go to  the bathroom and and you realize you've got the drop and then you gotta stand there like ah what 
[02:03:00]  do you do walk hunched over jeans it's worse though because jeans are thick so for a drop to soak  through well let me tell you something it's because you wear boxers right yeah see when you wear  um uh uh briefs diapers diapers they act like a diaper when you pull them up there's not going  to be anything going through a pant leg just uh just saying just saying just saying hey we got the  pope in a photo we gotta get to this the fiery pope photo yeah shop now they're just being sarcastic 
[02:03:30]  with me oh who needs now they don't ask anthony could you turn the audio on they just go who needs  audio we don't need audio audio is overrated there's your audio shut up on where uh pal talk  oh pal yeah they they yell at me is this thing still not working you're pushing it in yeah you know  is it the cd player well there's a piece off it and it's oh boy there's gonna be more pieces off 
[02:04:00]  of it in a second that's a oh jesus it's kind of tough to do a radio show without cd players that  are working that's three for today yeah the trump cd the cd itself or is it the player i don't know  i don't know what's going on today something's amiss bring the turntables back that's what i say  we'll have them burn some hot wax in the back some hot wax if you keep a track at home uh cd one  don't use we took that out of play so we've been uh using cd two for some reason the clip did not one 
[02:04:30]  two remember that so now we're going to go to cd three which is way down here on the floor and  that's not working either okay are you sure it's not the uh the burn method why don't you put a music  cd in there and see if it works because we're goofing on the pope and the fire no the music cds have been  working so it was burned wrong or something i i don't want to accuse anybody but something's  going on so the pope uh the pope's image is in a what a picture of a fire in a fire apparently it 
[02:05:00]  matches a photo of him also there's a photo of the pope and then they put it next to the fire pope  and fire pope he's like um one of the fantastic four now he could just turn into fire and do his  pope stuff as a fantastic four hero because it's the exact pose of a photo now how coincidental  is that that uh if you look over there jimmy see his picture is is the same pose as the fire shot 
[02:05:30]  silhouette of him in the flames well it's it's not much of a stretch because the pope looked like that  in every photo yeah his life with the hunchback that's true but but it's it looks obviously  photoshopped it's a lot of experience with photoshop myself and um it looks like they took  the old smudge tool to uh the fire and uh kind of dressed it up to look like the pope a little bit  it's a picture of a bonfire and maybe it sort of looked like a human and now you're you're saying 
[02:06:00]  maybe they use smudge to kind of make it look a little more like the yeah yeah maybe like the guy  whoever did it saw that fire picture saw the picture of the pope and went like well that's  kind of similar but if you do this you know and kind of pull some of the fire around it uh it looks  a little more like the pope does and what does it mean if the pope is seen in fire wouldn't that  mean he's he's just condemned to burn in hell turn the air conditioning on the pope's hot  yeah it means that uh yeah that hell won yeah hell won hell has the pope the fiery depths of hell 
[02:06:30]  has the pope the ultimate matchup it looks like the devil has won yeah the devil wins the devil wins  the devil wins in five games yeah who did you have god  linger longer  they had uh they had uh they had uh i was gonna go with a dumb tim wakefield joke effing oh well 
[02:07:00]  his whole uh pitching round was a joke so well yeah and i was gonna say that jesus was pitching and  throwing that topsy curvy garbage that tim wakefield uh jesus would have pitched better  on the cross on the mound than uh wakefield did with his feet all right we got another copy of the  pope he probably could have he could have rolled that rock out on the third day and it would have  it would have had more speed oh my goodness gracious jesus is on the mound of all the dramatic 
[02:07:30]  things i've ever seen jesus is on the mound jesus knew it was coming and punches pilot is washing his  hands goodness gracious  goodness gracious is that jesus trying to pitch with a hole in his hand  he dropped the rosin back through the hole in his hand again there he is at the right hand of god 
[02:08:00]  up in god's box that the excitement in the dugout that the roman guards are playing cards you should  see what's going on in the yankee dugout well nothing was going on the soldier was dabbing his lips with  vinegar  here's the pope audio i don't think there's any question as to who's going to be wearing that 
[02:08:30]  crowded thorns  and then jesus talks hey you got me out of purgatory  i'll be seeing you all again soon unless you're jewish then i'll be seeing you for the first time  i'm sure jenny during the rapture i'm sure jesus said the same thing a little over 2 000 years ago  we're still waiting yeah he's come back finally goodness gracious  of all the dramatic things uh petted and smiling the jews are all crying 
[02:09:00]  that's funny sergeant g from iraq goodness gracious the holy spirit is smiling the father knew  father the holy father knew you should see the last supper  she's such a tool she really is oh so goofable and uh we all know why uh the devil would win 
[02:09:30]  yeah yes uh rick in brooklyn yes rick he's going to linger longer for everybody rick go ahead yeah uh  seen one because god had uh phil rizzuto playing shortstop yeah ah that's right because when phil  rizzuto died of course all the sports uh journalists had to say i guess god needed a  i guess god needed a short step yeah why take derek jeter in his prime when you can have phil  rizzuto yeah lily who's who's pretty much a walking corpse exactly he's trying to run heaven he's 
[02:10:00]  babbling about clora shut up phil we get it talking about talking to god about the money store  who cares right we know you hate the meatloaf song you were in we heard oh we get it scooter you didn't  mean it oh jesus thank you for the linger longer there rick uh for brooklyn all right here it is  the mercurio trying to get channel five fired i don't know mercurio's on uh the local fox uh  five news here another linger longer paul mercurio we're lingering and longing all over the place 
[02:10:30]  here play no we're still uh waiting to play okay meanwhile some people are calling to photograph  a miracle they believe it shows the image of pope john paul ii alice and cayden caught up with  believers and skeptics for their reaction it's a fiery image and to many it looks just like pope  john paul ii look at the pictures side by side one of the fire one of the pope yeah yeah we showed it  to catholic kathy driscoll a specialist it's it's amazing it's amazing everyone involved in that story 
[02:11:00]  should be killed everyone down to the boom guy with the microphone they would show that on the  news yeah that that is not a newsworthy story especially since uh it's obviously been manipulated  speaking of the news um i was telling ant before the um show that our pal lee abrams yeah who pretty 
[02:11:30]  much boards our audience but i i like the guy a lot he really knows radio and he he has a good uh  head on his shoulders but he's a terrible bore he just doesn't know how to translate that to our  radio show unfortunately he writes a blog that i really love uh the blog is up on the other website  we're not allowed to mention that's the name of the show dot com oh right we're allowed to say that  much i don't know no uh really i don't know um but uh he got an email from george carlin about an  article he wrote a year ago about local news and it's everything we talk about everything i got to post

[02:20:00]  to think you're doing good i will tell you this yeah i disrespect those who disrespect my profession  i'm not just a comic i'm in a profession now all the years that they've had the festival here  i was never called because it's called punkos who ain't got the balls to call me i finally get  a call about three weeks ago some guy said uh i represent carolines i said that's your problem 
[02:20:30]  he said and we'd like to have you at carolines at the festus let me tell you something i'm a  fucking name i work theaters i don't work fucking carolines you understand punk asshole that you don't  know i said sarah silverman goes on uh saturday night live uh rosie o'donnell i said i work  theaters do your fucking homework you asshole and you know what do you think you're talking i'm talking to  your mother through your ass so when are you so when are you playing carolines no no there's another 
[02:21:00]  thing that bothers me they call you this a practice i represent carolines right well we want you to  work monday and tuesday take the door i said i got furniture if i want fucking furniture i said i don't  need your fucking door this is what i gotta get get my camario canton to go on a monday and  a fucking tuesday get joy bayhardt going on monday and tuesday they jerk off that's what they do on  a monday he knows all the big names in comedy there jim well i'm sitting next to a guy who's  terrific yeah you like him thank you but what about us i'm gonna put a butt on it i know you are and i 
[02:21:30]  respect him and i think he knows i mean that the last 15 minutes of that home box was tough to talk  about a woman's private parts the way he did i thought was not was too heavy you don't have to do  that because he's funny he's natural he's got a great way about him saying why go talking about a  woman's clit because i like it's a shit i like that funny no i understand i like a big clip pat  i agree but you know something he's working to one particular audience hopefully that they will 
[02:22:00]  and i'm saying here's a guy that's what what the hell is he doing why is he underneath the woman's  ass sucking at this and sucking at that that's not funny it is what's funny what's funny is what  he did because i said this guy's this guy's wonderful but why and i like him and i say to myself  this guy's he's gonna have to take it out one day because it's gonna hurt him you don't need that  because you got women saying wait a minute is that what we're about you talk about our vagina  and our pussy like what garbage dumps and that's what it sounded like i don't think he meant it 
[02:22:30]  i don't think you meant it that way and again i i care about we're in a great business where i'm on  my way out i've been on my way out since i was 40. on your way out how far away is that door i'm on my way  out jesus i'm i'm lucky i made this this is the last yeah it's a long hallway out the door no but  you see you're taking liberties which is fine if you feel comfortable but fine but i'm looking at  that as a comedian i'm saying to myself jesus christ you don't need that this guy don't need  that i want him on a series i said that's what i'm hoping this guy gets get him on a series that's 
[02:23:00]  the money today yeah but my acting is not up to snuff dateline nbc predator series i saw you on  that series you want you were wonderful thank you lucky louis yeah but no see you were the only good  thing on the show because you have brains enough to say i can't act see that's the scene then they're  going to get you to get your own series because but those who can't act that a fucking series  that's why the guys who have this series surround themselves with greatness well that's true do you  think seinfeld was a good actor right no no he was laughing all the time jerry was smart 
[02:23:30]  i respect jerry because he surrounded himself yeah i respected a mary tyler moore they surrounded  himself all in the family surrounded ray romano isn't a good actor absolutely who ray romano's not  a good guy's got trouble humming but he's a nice man he got the series god bless him i don't i don't be  i'm not jealous of him who gives a damn i'm out it's finished i'm 78 it's all over but at least we're  in a profession i want this gentleman to know you know i care about you because you're good and 
[02:24:00]  you're wonderful and you're but i'm saying somebody maybe that doesn't like him so keep doing it  and i'm saying i think one day they're gonna say to you you gotta cut that out that thing because  it's vulgar it's not funny anymore to get you to your my tongue i'm looking at that he's doing noises  that don't that don't fit and i'm talking to the set and my lady friends go why is he talking about  people's private parts i said shut up will you please the guy's a chameleon what the  fuck respect to talk about cucumbers but i do like that it is the truth like i do really like 
[02:24:30]  a big that's okay i'm not saying you don't like your material don't no no i'm your pussy i'm a big  pussy basically he's asking do you like a swollen pussy like he does i like a fat but you gotta  understand that the people that are listening to this are not in a comedic adult mode i'm talking  about because i've been around a long time and the only rap that people said to me about this  guy was the exact thing i said why did he do that last eight ten minutes because he don't need it he's 
[02:25:00]  a funny man and all of a sudden and and you know they could tell me my my fucking business i would  respect them i don't tell them how to funny i don't tell them how to drive but but when you care  about a guy you care you say this guy's good you don't need that this guy's good you want  to me to go mainstream no no i didn't say that well it's not listen you're not a comic do me a  favor do your fucking radio you're not in my fucking league i love these guys i don't do  fucking radio you stay out of my fucking business i don't tell them put you out of  cutting meat don't tell that guy how to masturbate you understand i was just trying to follow you i 
[02:25:30]  guess i can't follow nobody that's why you got this fucking show  but i like i know what you mean though but i like i don't mind getting that dirty i'm  comfortable being that dirty for everybody because i i i don't feel like i have to close  with it but i like it it's like i'm not saying that to take it out right i'm telling you i guarantee  you somebody's gonna tap you on the shoulder so listen you want to do here yeah you got to cut that  out otherwise you're gonna have a problem so you cut it out what's the big fucking thing you  only gonna live on that piece of material no of course not that are the great things but just 
[02:26:00]  nobody's gonna remember what you did except that piece of you know what though he's killed  on letterman and leno and he's done clean stuff on there no no bullshit he did not kill with that  material on letterman he didn't talk about a pussy and eating oh no that's what i mean he's able to  work though that's what i'm saying if he can go on let him i never get pussy i would rather him go on  letterman and j leno's i'm not knocking the man's talent he's a talented guy but i think that 
[02:26:30]  particular choice he don't need because this guy can skyrocket and i think somebody's i'm not going  to do this you can't work as we say the hilton hotel you know that kind of a thing or a certain  high-class hotel they'll say look you got to draw the line so i think what do you think of his advice  there i understand what he's saying this is me doing radio by i do understand what pat is saying  um i don't agree a hundred percent because when you look at guys that have gone again it's all doing what  you're looking at you fuck those guys it's it's uh uh a kinnison succeeded very well doing what he 
[02:27:00]  wanted i succeeded doing what he wanted i don't model myself after those guys but i think if you're  doing what's true to you okay i'm just saying yeah okay okay i never heard richard prior who to me was  one of the best i never heard don rickles to me is one of the best i never heard none of these guys  turn around and get raunchy you could talk about a woman's body part the many who say hello  the hair was coming out of it and the clit was hanging down i turned around and i got a heart 
[02:27:30]  off i said to my girl i can't look at your pussy no more you're fucking ugly he says why he's on  television he must be right so that's the end of it now i'm going into transvestites that's my show  hey well that we can agree on uh it's just it's just a difference in a in a take on a particular  it's not a knock to you i dig you i think you're terrific and i think you're gonna go wherever you  want to go thank you pat's telling you to get up and become a prop comic no what he's telling 
[02:28:00]  yeah yeah let me ask you yes sir you don't know fucking comedy what are you spending for this guy  this guy's a community i'm trying to learn through jimmy about comedy you're learning days are off you  start to learn you're gonna be out of this fucking show i'm telling you can't learn  anyway that's uh you know that's that's enough dad but i you know we're in a great profession  so you're you're taking advice from a guy wearing a members-only jacket i do respect  pat's opinion very much do you respect his jacket yes i do it's it's i would i would scream to the 
[02:28:30]  top of my my lungs to say this is a wonderful young man he absolutely is we love him i said you  know it's nice to see that in young people but when i saw that i'm not a prude i've done it all  i've seen it all but i said there were great comics we never got that way are we getting down  to that next we talk about on my mother's pussy and then my father's cock and then it becomes you  know what about we don't separate no then they're going to talk about the pope that he messed up  then we're going to talk about subject matter that should be left alone we don't need to get a left 
[02:29:00]  i'll give you an instant i'm on stern the other day but so stern says you three guys roast pat  so i said that under what condition they can roast me throw the paper away so they looked at me one guy  says i throw the paper away and he threw it away he goes by the way who's that cunt you're sitting next  still when i stopped that's let me tell you that's funny and stern says get out of here to you  no no nobody's not me i'm a genius of myself nobody tells me they'll throw him out off the  fucking air before i go but i tried to explain to the guy after the show was over i said you're so 
[02:29:30]  stupid you weren't desperate you're panicked you said i go what does my girlfriend's got to do  with trying to roast somebody jerry stiller was roasted a wonderful man one comic is  asshole goes off that goes after jerry stiller's wife's vagina what the fuck has that got to do  with a roast because they panic they take motherfucking and if you say the curse words  and there's a story it blends i got a flow i can say fuck 90 million nobody gets offended there's a  certain flow there are people who say they go oh geez don't say that word that's the difference 
[02:30:00]  that's the difference but but well and you're right we all judge our own flow a certain way like  i know what i do that's true to my thinking like that guy probably did panic to blast someone's  girlfriend and call her a cunt and it's stupid for no reason at all but unless you're talking to  paul mccartney well yeah exactly a one-legged one at that um but to blast somebody uh the woman just  for being there is panic move but to be vulgar because that's what you want to do is different  i agree with you there but the guy turns around and all he had to do they don't have to force himself 
[02:30:30]  to try to be funny take it out on someone that was not being roasted right you're roasting me  don't roast that guy over there i can do it because i am going to be roasted i can turn around and say  go after his remarks and say what what this man says to me what pat does this now i'm going to  turn to myself so really when i get up i'll say this this that's a roast but when i go into the  audience was nothing to do with it the only thing i ever did that that they still talk about it what's 
[02:31:00]  her name was in the uh it was in one of the rows there the girl that was uh ran away with with a  gun with the uh oh yeah yeah and she's sitting in the front row and i go honey pat so nice to see  you we know you did it yeah and it was like and the fucking place yeah of course you gotta laugh  at that but that's a celebrity being in the audience that's a famous person that's fair game  i mean they're showing up in the rows that's fair game but i generally don't like to go in to the  audience i like to see it up here and i tell people the secret of a roast is pay attention 
[02:31:30]  what you can't say and they go what do you mean i said they're going to say this about that one this  about that one you know you can't say it what what if you ain't got enough go after somebody else on  that fucking days but just keep going so they want five six seven minutes if you can't hold five six  seven minutes and i see milton burr and i've done them with the biggest get up and tell this  particular comic stop you didn't do your homework what gives you a right he said what gives you the 
[02:32:00]  fucking right to stand up with great talent now sit down and shut up the guy was never on a roast  again and i told him i try to tell you stay the fuck off you got trouble whispering you got trouble  spitting you don't know what the fuck you're doing i'm gonna be on a roast all right you know it's the  chicken you're stupid who is the comic i don't want to tell you none of your business who's the  comic that you on howard show huh who is it oh no i don't know there was three young guys nice guys  i didn't put the guy down i wasn't mad at him but my lady said you got to forgive him because he 
[02:32:30]  panicked and he didn't know and right right and i tell you barry gary doll about he said he grabbed  him he said let me tell you something you see why this man's great he knows when to sweat and he said he  didn't mean it i said the man didn't mean it because he didn't know what the to do i said now if  you're going to be in a state of panic don't go in that hallway you don't belong don't go on the  days if you don't belong him gets up this i belong fine now you're gonna have to put your fucking  nickels down and we've had some great stars who had trouble you know he's a lot of pressure for 
[02:33:00]  you guys now absolutely because pat uh what pat is talking about uh he's being roasted on friday  at the friars club we're all invited uh and i get to just sit there and uh jimmy will actually  be roasting pat cooper one of the many guys roasting you get pat some water i'm asking my  friend for some water it's unopened unopened that's it could be open anyone that eats pussy i like to  drink with yeah who do you think is uh hey that's ad-libbing that's using your comedic  fucking mind that's when it comes natural right that's why when a young shit ass 30 year old tells me 
[02:33:30]  you're gonna go into carolines as you first of all go to a fucking school and learn your craft  you don't go to a butcher and grab the knife and say i'm a fucking butcher go to school and find  out who pat cooper is don't ask me for a tape you sick fuck i said i want a tape of you what do you  want to take me for i want to know what the fuck you do you scumbag i said how dare you work for  carolines and he hung up on me now caroline i don't know nothing against caroline caroline doesn't even 
[02:34:00]  know comedy caroline is an empirical producer of comedy she stays home and hopes she gets laid  after him give a fucking laugh don't matter we're under the hammer every fucking time we go out  i'm 78 how many fucking hammers hit me over the head so there you go but i respect my fellow comedian  and i'm not looking to say i hope he fucking bombs i come on so listen to me you want to do some take  that out maybe put that in it might help you i don't know who do you think who do you think's a  a great roaster over the years who's really good up there 
[02:34:30]  a great roasters was the guys like uh rickles you know something no don rickles no when you say  great roaster because don rickles and i told this to don in fact it was roast we we were doing bob  newhart and he was the one emceeing the show and and it didn't happen you understand it just because  he can't say the mexican over there the guy over there i said when the fuck do you talk about the  days yeah so but he decided well i'm not the guy who's all got to do it so we are roasting bob newhart 
[02:35:00]  i tell you guys like burr were one of the greatest ones i did uh i did a dean martin roast not the  ones on television had to be one of the best no but not no no i never did his television show i'm  talking was dean martin sinatra the uh uh tommy lasorda i'm talking heavyweights when no girls  were allowed and what's her name the comedian there she's about 90 years old but i don't  phyllis diller oh yeah she came in dressed as a man it's a true story that's funny though man 
[02:35:30]  god i think it was great all right good but they nailed her and they had to leave her out there  now you're talking about starkers you're talking about that the guy that lived to be 90 years old  george uh gracie allen and george i mean you're talking about fat jackie lindy talking about henny  youngman this is not pointing at him to be those kind but this is where my my my my my expertise came  from watching these fucking guys on a roast i mean they could they had writers i'm with you because uh 
[02:36:00]  the dean martin roast that they show on tv all the time and you can get the dvds they're just amazing  and i see a lot of these roasts on comedy central and some of the guys they're really good at but a lot  of them are like but they got to learn from the did you know that dean martin roast  a lot of them were never in the same room what do you mean really no i'm gonna teach you something  did you know that don rickles when he's roasting was cost was told to come down to the studio  and they had pictures of james stewart pictures of john johnny carson and they just framed that 
[02:36:30]  get the fuck out of here so they have a close-up of just uh don rickles not only don rickles a lot  of them that then they would turn around and try to get them all one day and just take that one  maybe 30 seconds and show them but a lot of them holy shit are you kidding me so they have a close  up i know you're not kidding me it's just an expression relax don't jump down my throat we're  having a conversation here i'm worried about his throat no i want to follow you here so they got  a close-up but those guys aren't even all the time but what they did is with some of these guys  let's assume say don guys i can't make it so now they got bob hope there so they inserted don 
[02:37:00]  into that into the set right right so but a lot of people didn't know that in fact his producer  even said it when when they were interviewing him that's tough that's tough so this is what  they but they can you know edit everything and make it make it look so what are you trying to  say with that it's easier to do what they were doing in the old days because the the people they  were roasting weren't there well let me put it this way if you fuck up right do it again i got you 
[02:37:30]  hello so a guy says what she's i don't like when i said but that race that try again because it  takes a certain amount of balls to actually like beat up these guys right in front of their face  so it would probably be easier if you're alone on set by yourself and they're going to throw in the  laugh tracks and the long shots of everyone laughing on the dais it seems like it would be easier to  beat someone up right fryers roast is the true roast and particularly now with youngsters coming  along who should look at the old roast and see what it's all because a lot of them buy  material which is nothing wrong with that we got guys in the roast they go uh i'll give you three 
[02:38:00]  lines give me a grand that's just i'll tell you i'll give you 19 for nothing you assholes i don't  need none of them but guys needed so what happens is they turn around and they write something guy  gives them the grand or five one i'm not i guess these writers getting paid never never works because  the writer doesn't know what's inside this gentleman knows what's inside him yeah jimmy doesn't use  writers no but i'm bringing he knows what's inside him he knows where i can swim or more i can't swim  a lot of them go i can do that i said no so in other words if somebody gives you a knife you can 
[02:38:30]  open ahead i have a feeling you're going to be cracking some skulls on friday no way you're  going to jump up and beat some of these uh comedians up no if they can't take it get the  off that's a lot of pressure for these guys no pressure no no pressure it's no pressure because  they accept it they accept it and the worst thing to do is one second true don't rehearse it you can't  rehearse a fucking roast they're in front of the mirror the worst part of a roast is when the 
[02:39:00]  audience gets uncomfortable with the comedians brutalizing each other they get uncomfortable  with what we're comfortable with yeah which is shitting on each other uh and they some  the mc has to kind of let them know it's okay we're comfortable with this and you know no one's  getting the feeling nothing i've nothing's worse than watching a comic get up there though and the  first couple of of uh jokes they throw out just bomb and you sit there and go oh boy now if you  tell the comic before he goes on you say look come here just in case because i know the guy ain't 
[02:39:30]  gonna make it i fucking know he's gonna make it just in case you get up there and you go  say it's been a pleasure get the fuck off all right now i'm gonna tip you off paul schaefer  remember paul schaefer yeah paul schaefer from the letterman show sure all right we're roasting  jerry lewis last year this guy comes in has to have a piano for him this guy's as funny as 
[02:40:00]  fucking pants you understand i'm so fucking insulted that this fucking guy had the balls to  come on a fucking roast roasting jerry lewis and he starts to try to tell a story he was on 20  fucking minutes and he's playing and i'm saying when the does he get off i go on after him  because i'm last okay wait a minute my opening line is i want to thank you paul 
[02:40:30]  for giving jerry lewis a chance to go to sleep you fucking asshole how dare you do i go in your  fucking band and play you gotta stay out of that that's what i'm trying to say you got to blame  the friars club though no why would they have a guy like that in their in their fine establishment  thinks he's a celebrity like he's got a brand no they really think he could have pulled it off  well they don't want to insult the guy no way tell them no like you should be the president or  whatever they need over there let me tell you something oh boy it's a lot 
[02:41:00]  of politics involved also we all know that and the idea is you can't there's no more guys of my  age anymore so these young guys are coming along who are great and it's good for them to get up  there and say yeah i got fucking balls and you know if you don't kill but you survive yeah well  that's okay too mentally you go home you say you know something i'm with them that's with the big guys  right that really is the big guy but to see paul schaefer i said get the fuck like the fuck i  i it's like me going into his fucking band and say give me a kazoo because i think i can play along 
[02:41:30]  and you know something that's an insult because he didn't care right about the fucking people  waste who spent ten thousand dollar fucking tables and this guy comes up that's why you get a puppet  how's your blood pressure pat i have none i died maybe uh hey is jerry lewis gonna be there at your  roast i don't know jerry lewis was taking catnats not when i was on because he wouldn't dare see jerry  lewis wouldn't there because i fucking glob him what's that about though why would you sleep because 
[02:42:00]  he's not well oh and if you remember he had a mildly heart attack going back to vegas jerry's not well  jerry in my opinion is probably one of the geniuses of our business and jerry is 80 some  odd years old has contributed so much that kind of comedy is over my comment come i'm lasting because  i'm getting involved with controversy and stuff but you know you're talking about pussy more but  you gotta know when to quit you gotta know yeah that's gotta be a hard thing though just sad part 
[02:42:30]  just leave walk away that's gotta be hard they said to me i got a job for you in utah i said listen  to me i love utah me and the mormons don't understand each other i ain't going that's  the end of it i don't go on a stage where i know i don't have a chance it's ridiculous i i uh do you  accept any gigs huh guy from carolines you tell him to go fuck himself he says no a lot utah tells  it no i'm not going there because the guy that's booking carolines or the girl don't do their homework 
[02:43:00]  they say what does pat cooper do i said tell him i clean fish what the fuck do i do you sick  fuck what do you do how dare you insult me first of all how about manners for an old and adult  how about a young punk saying mr cooper you know but don't tell me what do you do you little  asshole go to school and learn about comedy what is who's milton burrell who's groucho march who's  all these guys and learn why they became successful now sit there and say i'm booking acts now book your  mother book your mother you sick fuck out of the young guys who do you like it seems like you're but i 
[02:43:30]  saw a mob the other day well give us a few names like who do you like out there pat you're like a  legend you're not the district attorney come i'll turn your mic off let me explain something i'll go  past carolines the other day you need me because i could just do that i don't need  shit you know what i do for a hobby i rehearse dying i'm gonna grab you  so let me tell you something let me tell you something yeah i went past carolines the other 
[02:44:00]  day all right there was about how to be 100 comics there trying out for what get into the festival oh  okay okay yeah okay the big uh new york comedy festival now i must tell you this every one of them  looked the same there was not one guy who looked neat and clean with a fucking jacket and a fucking  tie i says this is the same picture they're all coming in to do two minutes the only guy i understand  what what the fuck i think was that guy with an indian cap on he went he got two minutes but as  far as the young guys i know this gentleman when i met him you know we did carl and quinn show and we 
[02:44:30]  had we have great shows at carl and quinn sure but i don't i i i don't get a chance to see  like sarah silverman she's probably great i never saw her you know i never saw a lot of the guys  get the guys on saturday night because most of the times i'm working and then i forget about it you  know you do bring up a good point because i do see a lot of comedy and you see a lot of young  comedians that are like playing the role of a comic you know what i mean they got the look  they got the lines they're very rehearsed but it's like i think you got to be true to yourself 
[02:45:00]  who's overrated who that lou black lewis i think he's overrated i don't think he's funny i said young  guys that's my opinion that's my opinion i saw him on a couple of specials i'm saying uh jesus christ  i said i don't know he's tell me he's not funny funny this guy's funny funny i'm not i don't dislike  those if he likes what i don't like when i say fuck him i'm not worried about it i wanted to  understand not everybody likes me not everybody likes everybody so what's your advice to the young  comedians to be to be true to yourself though or you know what i mean like you could you could see 
[02:45:30]  the difference we we have a lot of comedians that come in here okay we know the guys that are actually  naturally funny and some of them have a funny act there's a big difference and then some of these  guys it's called mechanics mechanics okay i don't know the terminology but so what do you what would you  say to young comedians what not to do your homework they won't worry about and he'll know it because  he's been in that era don't worry about uh i don't go on first or second hole or third hole  i said how about honing your craft the fuck you worried about if you go on first second or third you're 
[02:46:00]  a baby you're a you're a small little kid yet you're learning fuck when you go on second or third  let the guy once you go on third let him worry about it you learn learn because automatically they'll  say come here you you're going on close you're a fucking strong guy but they're all fighting  or when i hear a comic go i'm funnier than him how the fuck he's on television guys because you're  stupid you're worried about who's funnier than me and funnier than me that's me while you're  cleaning spittoons you asshole do your homework learn out there if this young man can teach you 
[02:46:30]  something go this is a great business but we're in a dangerous business comedy is the toughest  fucking thing in show business even opera which is supposed to be tough don't come near comedy  because we got to get laughs every couple of seconds when you start to see a guy get laughed  every five minutes trains are going you understand this is what what's happening comedy has changed  music has changed i pass the hat on to these young guys i'm wonderful don't put nobody down but i can  smell when a guy my dentist right you do me a fucking favor drill the fucking key when you drill 
[02:47:00]  the fucking door i gotta tell you store you tell me one more fucking story i don't want to hear about  hey pat let me tell you i'm gonna start to do stand sit down or i go someplace else i don't want  to fucking hear about you you got no fucking talent hey pat i gotta ask you where do you get your balls  from be serious for a moment where do you get these big fucking balls from like i'll tell you why i 
[02:47:30]  respect you you're one of the only guys that uh didn't kiss howard's ass and you were still able to  come back many many times and that was so refreshing to hear but i come in here with respect i don't  dislike you two guys i don't i don't think that at all i like him no no i'm not even it's not all i'm saying  is like you're not worried about how how you're going to be no uh perceived i i love that  i didn't listen to me but where does it come from listen to me when you can tell your mother and  father cut the shit don't you dare do that to me i'm a fucking human being right why should i worry 
[02:48:00]  about saying about other people why should i say hey who the fuck are you yeah but it's rare you  don't see a lot of guys like you honestly take on everybody and you're like you know what if this  fucks my career who gives a shit he's a curse you can't be honest because they don't want to hear it  woman says tell me the truth pat am i heavy you're fat you're not fucking heavy will you do me a  favor stop swallowing i don't fucking you stay skinny if you turn around and don't shit you must  shit you must go out and pee when you pee you are the luckiest person i know guys multi-millionaire

[02:52:00]  want to roast a comedian who can roast because at the end you're going to go up and fucking blast  everybody and that's the way to close the show and another thing i say i i'm 78 years old they say  pat can you get up at four in the morning and do this show i get up because to me that's important  you never know who's listening on the other side you never said well he's not a big radio guy or he's not  a small you do it i tell some guys i'm gonna get up and says jesus i want to be there at 3 30. get

[02:53:00]  is my last i was there three times this is the last but that's okay i'm not angry at letterman that  god bless him he did great you're there for 25 fucking years now leno's sweating sweating he's  there 14 years they may push him for conan o'brien who gives a fuck they are pushing him for conan  o'brien but uh leno's like fuck that and he's already looking to go somewhere else he doesn't  want to leave it's turning out if they if if they turn around and let leno go how do you turn around  and you let a guy that's batting 500 give me a fucking break i mean that's terrible they're gonna 
[02:53:30]  push him out brian is not maybe 11 30 to 12 30 he may not be that he's not wrong with him he may  not be that but somebody says i think that's the future how about fucking today and don't worry  about who you're gonna fuck 10 years from now you may not get a hard on they don't understand that  so you're dealing with guys who are in business trying to make a great movement so we push leno  out and and he's number one in that time slot that's what's fucked up about it listen before  leno so what does leno do well leno see leno doesn't want to leave that leno would rather sleep in that 
[02:54:00]  chair and leno has proved that he don't take a day off he doesn't and you know still does his gigs  a weekend absolutely he's a guy that's a winner what the fuck you know if it's if it ain't broke  why are you trying to fix it so you want to push conan o'brien and nothing against conan o'brien he's  not already guaranteed he's going to do exactly what leno did in my personal opinion before leno i  thought letterman should have been the should have been the guy but that's only my opinion meanwhile 
[02:54:30]  let him prove me wrong and meanwhile let him prove me right also he's excellent so what the  fuck you're gonna do what are you gonna do what happened i lost you there you lost a lot of  excellent all right we're gonna take a break pat cooper we got the big roast whenever you want me to go  let me know uh well uh i'm serious stay stay stay sit down what time you're off the air uh at 11.  you're doing that long yeah yeah yeah cut it down to 10 30. tell us about it pat said we have to go home  at 10 30 we're going home at 10 30 today we're doing it down to 10 like human are you going to 
[02:55:00]  the roast yeah we're going to be on the dance we're not allowed to talk because we're not comedians  like you said so we'll sit there and listen don't get in stuff i don't recognize that i'm brushing  it's just that i got a bad fucking memory sometimes pat let me tell you something though uh and i don't go  out much so this is a big thing for us we we usually say no to everything because you're on four o'clock  in the fucking morning that's one of them but we usually don't go to these things why did you do one  show why do you have to do two fucking shows because we're like jay lano we're stupid you're  not like jay lano you're not you're not competitive you're in your own boat no you don't want to put 
[02:55:30]  all our eggs in one basket with this business i think i think it's a company merging you got  company that you can't say uh the n-word anymore you can't do this you can't do that so that's another  thing so we we don't know where our careers are going you know there's a merger going on milk  carmen yeah big howard fan not a big fan of ours because what we did to howard so we don't  know if we're going to be part of the merger you did nothing thank you pat exactly i  why don't you go tell mel that you know what i told howard that you know what i told i'll tell 
[02:56:00]  you what i told howard what's up with the dentures i said howard you want to know the truth you made  them bigger you didn't hurt them because when they're screaming he's screaming at you he elevated  you guys that's way to open empty why is he fighting sometimes a great fight like that makes  him bigger let me tell you something i'm gonna say something here like i tried to get a little  serious moment out of you but i couldn't all right i couldn't accomplish about it but i will tell  you this howard stern played right into our fucking hands right into our fucking hands we were  the small guys in new york and we're like how do you get attention you go after the big dog and then  you and you can't be scared to go after the big dog you can't go after the big dog and and in a 
[02:56:30]  in a pussy way you got to go right at him but why do you say that about me then you know i'm right  you're absolutely right you just said something that made me think of something i'm like i'm giving  you props that's exactly i will give howard props for making us bigger but he was he was stupid to  play right into our hands that's exactly what we were going for i said we knew we had the talent but we  also knew we needed to get uh attention out there like you said right and that's what we did we're  like howard in his backyard we go after him and we did well and he played into it you know the old 
[02:57:00]  because he couldn't take it and we're like well as he's not taking it he's making us bigger well  don't you know the old story when you go after the big guy you're getting you know you get attention  you can't go off the guy that nobody knows about exactly that's the way it is but you know something  it's it's it's it's helped both of course so what's the big deal because i said howard we're not  going to be here forever so if they're the new guys that's the next but what's who gives a  fuck right i mean i'll finish he's the next generation if he stops talking about uh big  pussy lips though i didn't mean that because he doesn't look like he has any feelings 
[02:57:30]  an old-school guy we have a different take on certain things  no i'm not feeling it's not hurting all right listen we're gonna take a break i'm happy he liked  the rest of the special i'm actually impressed dude pat enjoyed something they're supposed to play  it again they're supposed to play it again they will give him a dvd oh i don't have mine today i  would hand you mine i would get another copy give pat cooper uh your dvd jimmy he's a busy man he's  watched your whole special he sat down and watched it he was just too tired to get up it was only one 
[02:58:00]  play he are you selling that out where you work uh not yet the dvd deal they gave me is not that  good area what selling where you are what because you're asking the audience who say pay fifty dollars to  see you then you want to say twenty dollars for your album as they're walking out the door  now you're asking to cut the people to pay seventy dollars to see you and i think it looks amateur  night when you're standing there like the smothers brothers they sell wine they sell yo-yos i says you  know well i don't know why don't you sell pussy necks for christmas you've never seen what is this 
[02:58:30]  a mall you've never seen a bigger amateur i stand there and whore anything i'll  fucking park your car if you want to pay me that's all right nothing wrong with that but  jimmy gives the personal touch we give the personal touch i think that's important when  you have a fan base it's very important i'm serious but i don't like to go out in the  fucking lobby and sit stand there and start saying you want my album you want my  shit go on the fucking computer and get it if you don't who the fuck cares because i'm not into 
[02:59:00]  that i gotta sell i seen guys sell i told you everything i seen a guy come off the show sweating  like a bastard running in the lobby so the people don't run out there like a carnival barker i got  him with me screaming at people as they walk out buy something okay now listen to me here's the old  trick if you buy say 50 000 of your albums yeah okay that's registered that you bought 50 000 of your  albums now you claim you only sold 10 000 albums the government says where's the other 40. they're 
[02:59:30]  coming after those guys right what the guy the guy in brooklyn bought 10 000 boxes for the pizza  boxes and he said he only sold 3 000 is this true they said where's the other  fucking boxes is that really true they're counting the boxes oh  that's a good way to get them no you gotta be careful oh you gotta be careful right  he said what are you talking i'm making three thousand a pizza right  they said about come you bought 10 000 boxes oh shit really that's what's come down to that 
[03:00:00]  that is funny he's not talking italian yeah yeah we understand oh that is funny because there's a  bill of lady pat cooper bought 10 000 of his albums if he sold 5 000 that's all i saw it now  you show him the closet there's the other 5 000 you better show him the other 5 000  that got you by the fucking ball all right listen we got to take a break we want your take on  imus after the break i'm sure you got something on that fuck him  really fuck him again all right we'll talk about him again all right we'll talk about him again all

[03:02:30]  because i've heard you many times a lot of things did not come off who try to do what i do  i can't do what this gentleman does so i don't do it you won't catch any diseases  yeah well listen yeah he takes a he takes a log on his chest every once in a while  listen he's on his way i'm telling you that right we all know that if he's not in his way then i don't  know comedy we all know that to respect the man is to go over and give him a hug and say listen  just be careful that's all you're on you got a shot the fucking great shot and it's nice to see 
[03:03:00]  that you know what i mean he's not a wise ass he's not a come on to he's always nice from when we  did the colon and we did some ad-lib that was hilarious and he will tell you that i mean  calling a grunker called what's it called colin it doesn't matter it doesn't matter colon's more  appropriate he would even say it doesn't matter it's just so anyway so what uh what's your problem  with imus uh that seemed a little real before the break listen to me the man don't tell the truth 
[03:03:30]  number one the man's a coward number two number three what he said he said worse than that then  and they've worse than that crap stern has said worse than that but he calmed down with his tail  between his leg and he went over the house shop then and he said i'm tovey and that other  asshole who's a producer mcgurk who likes to hit people by the way he thinks you're gonna he beat up  the uh the uh the sports guy that used to be on the show they had like a legitimate fist fight oh 
[03:04:00]  wow oh yeah see you're in a coma you gotta wake up no no i'll tell you no he's had many different  sports guys there pat i'm gonna i'm gonna defend myself uh yeah said okay they you know i'll beat  you up they had a fight but that's beside the point okay so now i turn around and i said to  he says to me one day uh i miss him he said hey you don't like steve scharripper i said he's a bully  what i said he's a bully and i went on to tell the wise a bully next week he has steve scharripper 
[03:04:30]  on which is that right steve has a right to protect himself if i'm calling him a bully and he said well  you know someone bothers me about that i inherit him from stern now i'm watching listen to this i'm  ready to control his shoe up that's you fucking liar you piece of shit liar turn around i'm in vegas  three o'clock in the morning they wake me up because he's doing a live thing from vegas so  he's got to be on six o'clock in new york i got up out of bed and do a show i became one of his top  guests you understand and all of a sudden he decides who's right and who's wrong what i'll 
[03:05:00]  call him means i want to bring patty so you can talk to steve's face you see but he took a part see  i was one of his best fucking guests then mcgurk turns around over the air he goes well where's pat  going and i'm yelling to the set you piece of shit i've been there already where the  fuck are you going you don't belong he don't but he tried to become a comic he's as funny as  shit that's how funny he is but but i said you inherited me now i want to defend myself because  howard never told me not to come on this show he never told me to go on imus well no one tells me 
[03:05:30]  what to do but to tell me that you inherited me right first of all he's not in he's not in any of  your leagues he's a boring old fucking man and i gotta tell you this he's not a nice man and the big  protection is he has a ranch his ranch is treat ducks and a fucking cow but he's got a ranch so  anytime they knock his brains out he goes when i'm raising money for children why don't you raise  money for your fucking brains and how to treat people he's very evil toward people he doesn't  know class he doesn't understand it he's a fucking horse shit cowboy that hangs around new york and 
[03:06:00]  can't ride a fucking horse that's and the biggest mistake he made was going on reverend i'll show  the biggest mistake he made was showing he's not a fucking man but meanwhile he's talking to  political greats what they should and shouldn't do he didn't stand up and i got news here his  radio show is going to go on the shitter he'll never be the imus of yesterday because everybody  will tell you you're a fucking dog right now how he stood up to shopton and said how dare you think 
[03:06:30]  that i said that fuck you al and fuck your racist remarks how about that now you come on the air and i'll  tell you what they think here and let me tell you there are black people i don't like there are  italians i don't like but don't call me a fucking racist you asshole yeah see that i agree with that  what i definitely agree with the way he handled it was awful uh the tail between his legs the the  apologizing the groveling to the likes of reverend al sharpton who shouldn't be given credibility by  anybody did you read today's paper al says he's not sure yet if he's gonna let him yeah if he's gonna 
[03:07:00]  allow him that enraged us we talked about that yeah yeah he's he wants to hear from citadel and  abc uh and what it is that there's things in his contract that'll keep him from saying bad things  since when is reverend al involved in his country all the people's contracts reverend al is a bully  that's what it breaks he's a racist a separate he's one of the word he is like the opposite of of uh  he's the black side of what the ku klux klan is i tell you and i'll bet my life on it there are 
[03:07:30]  african americans that don't like this man oh yeah he's hurt the god damn culture he's hurt the  culture we've heard that from a lot of uh black people gonna be ashamed of himself pat he doesn't  make a living unless there's hatred between the races so he keeps he keeps it going he keeps the  heat on he keeps race baiting and uh throwing out his racist remarks and the guy is making a living  got to hit him in the ass son of a letter because people why are we part of him why are we uh one 
[03:08:00]  of the only shows that uh you know call out al like that most of these guys haven't said shit uh  about the imus thing and and reverend al oh everyone's a general man i was afraid of reverend  al now like you know comedy we know radio and a lot of these radio show hosts they just  fucking were too scared to you know speak their mind about this whole thing i'm gonna tell you  why they have no character and they have no fucking dignity they'll give up their fucking radio  what are you crazy give up my radio from they say two million dollars a year and have a guy dump on

[03:09:30]  i'm not a tough guy i don't fight nobody but i say what's on my mind so if i'm wrong you say you're  wrong okay fine right we all but to be wrong is wonderful that's how you learn well it's scary what  radio is becoming because now you you got to think about being nice on the radio we talk about this all  the time as well like yeah why you got to be nice like what people have to be nice to every if you don't  like somebody you should be able to get bob grant who's a friend of mine he cried when they called  them a racist he cried on the air he said i'm not a racist i says i called him i said bob you don't 
[03:10:00]  have to cry the fuck you're crying for you can act like a man what's the matter with you so he gets  fired and he goes to another program and finally he retires now i understand he's back again i love  i love bob let it be known he was uh at a radio station a few years back and i couldn't run fast  enough down the hall to meet that man i want to meet him we love that guy absolutely you used to  say back in the day you want to talk about balls thank you you want to talk about balls like holy 
[03:10:30]  shit but he never he never came back from that from that whole episode you know why he was he was  getting older too though you know you know why he cried he was terribly hurt to think that people  would think that him all the years he's been on that radio why would you in other words if i said  one thing that's the end of my career yeah he got he got hired from another station well that's what  we're faced with but it was never the same no it wasn't we're faced with that one thing could get  you kicked off the radio oh you could get your job back but then they'll put all kinds of rules on 
[03:11:00]  you that you can't say this and that and the other thing and now it's not even just the fcc it's the  company itself tells you don't talk about this don't talk about this racial group don't talk  about the blacks the asians the jews don't talk about this and then you get you're left with  nothing all right i'm in the shopping mall and i said to the woman i says uh are they on sale these  pants huh are they on sale these pants and she rings a bell and another guy comes over and she's
