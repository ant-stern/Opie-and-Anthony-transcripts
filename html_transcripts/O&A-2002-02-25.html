<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts discussing their disappointing radio ratings in New York, contrasting them with better numbers in Philadelphia and Boston.  They use a drug-dealer analogy to describe the difficulty of obtaining rating information.  The conversation then shifts to the closure of their former Boston station.  Their mood sours dramatically when Craig, the censor, informs them that a planned on-air segment featuring women in a "55-gallon drum challenge" (the specifics of which remain vague) has been canceled by management.  Opie's furious reaction involves throwing phones and damaging the studio.

The hosts then dissect management's decision, focusing on their interpretation of the hosts' use of coded language ("yellow discipline," "Cleveland steamer"), which, while understood by listeners, posed potential legal risks if transcribed.  They express frustration with increasingly restrictive management, feeling their creative freedom is being stifled.  Listeners call in, discussing a previous guest, Tom Likus, who is insulted and accused of domestic violence.  Another caller reports that WNEW, their station, may be sold.  Stacy calls to propose a less explicit 55-gallon drum challenge involving lamb's blood.  A humorous discussion ensues about sourcing the blood.

A lengthy discussion about Jason Williams' arrest follows, questioning the discrepancy between the relatively minor charges ("recklessness," "mischief," "shenanigans," "tomfoolery") and the seriousness of the crime (manslaughter). The hosts express their views and frustration with management's cautious approach.  A listener calls about a Hells Angels/Pagans fight at the Vanderbilt, prompting anecdotes about bootlegging concert recordings.  The hosts' outrage over censored content ("dumped" material) continues, citing examples like sound effects from the "Guess What's in My Pants" segment.  The segment concludes with speculation about the show's and the station's future.

The show continues with a discussion and playback of a bootleg recording of an Ozzy Osbourne concert from 1992.  Ozzy Osbourne himself then calls in, engaging in lighthearted banter with the hosts about the concert and his new reality show, "The Osbournes."  Following this, the hosts play listener-submitted "F.U." messages.  Kimmy from *Survivor* appears as a surprise guest. An "Oz Man Ass Report" from Fast Freddy Ass Butter detailing explicit scenes from HBO's *Oz* is then dissected.

A pre-planned segment features Double LC from Cleveland attempting to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge via a handstand.  This involves crude jokes about her body and attire, along with graphic descriptions of a previous caller, "Stalker Patty's," foot surgery. The segment is punctuated by off-color jokes, comments about Pakistani people, and frequent "F.U. line" calls.  A caller from Austin complains about limited advertising in his area, and the hosts promote their "F-potion."  A discussion about a Sandy Kane picture banned from their website but posted on foundrymusic.com ensues.  Double LC fails the handstand, leading to further discussion of the 55-gallon drum challenge, including future participants and potential lamb's blood stunts.  A caller suggests a pay-per-view handstand challenge.  The segment ends with a call about an upcoming meeting with superiors.

The final segment addresses the hosts' anxiety over a meeting about their low ratings (down to 1.2 from 1.7 four years prior).  A humorous skit involving a time-traveling black girl predicting their poor reception is performed.  A phone call with Mary for the "6 o'clock queef" segment follows, with suggestive banter about her location near an Adult World store.  The "What Did We Learn Today?" segment features numerous callers sharing crude and often nonsensical anecdotes.  Discussion of upcoming events, including a 55-gallon jump challenge and concert ticket giveaways, ensues. The broadcast concludes with further speculation about the upcoming meeting and the show's future.

[00:05:00]  you're gonna explain the concept of a lead-in no that that's that's obvious stuff i want to  explain why we lost our effing minds today yeah okay  um i uh destroyed the office today you're gonna need uh they finally put it back together 
[00:05:30]  a titanium phone does anyone make titanium telephones for opie so when he throws them  at the window they actually crash through it and fall onto 57th street instead of just splintering  into thousands of pieces how close was it uh from going out the window seriously it hit the uh  radiator thank god because you would have killed somebody waiting to get into brooklyn diner  i'm thinking the glass wouldn't have broke it no that's what i was hoping for it might have broke  in a split second decision i'm assuming that the phone would break before the window would how many 
[00:06:00]  phones you've been through so far honestly how many phones this one um three or four yeah four four  four four phones and i can't even count how many garbage bills they tend to split on the seam when  you boot kick them oh that goes back to the old uh af across the room remember how much stuff we  broke at af yeah but uh why don't you explain from your vantage point because you were enjoying your  you were enjoying your little uh computer game well i'm just on the computer you know you were you 
[00:06:30]  weren't enjoying a game of everquest or just having a little fun you know you just got into into work  and then you settled down by playing a little everquest right before we get into what's what's going to  happen today on our radio show i like to unwind a little sure and uh craig comes in he's the dump  guy he's the guy that um is keeping uh you people from hearing a lot of entertaining stuff  and he comes in and says um the girls that are uh supposed to be coming in to qualify for the 55 
[00:07:00]  gallon drum challenge like uh yeah today um well they can't do what they said they want to do  can't do it on the air there's no way they could do what uh what they said they were going to do on  the air if they want to do it off the air um that's one thing but it's like you get off the air  that's good for a radio show let's do it off the air yeah that really works so management has uh come  up with this great idea do it off the air so no one can hear it all right that's good you should have 
[00:07:30]  seen the show we did over the weekend off the air it was great it was a lot of fun it's probably one  of the best shows we did all it was so much fun it was the uh uh seeing kevin meani at caroline's  show that was fun full of uh great dirty language and a great story from kevin about how he almost  got arrested in uh colorado that was a lot of fun yes that was a good story you know the imaginary  ratings for that imaginary show that we did over the weekend through the roof yeah the imaginary  ratings are great for the off the air show and then the off the air uh uh segment we did at rick's 
[00:08:00]  house at the party over the weekend what a great great show that was off the air and i'm hearing uh  it broke all kinds of off the air ratings records who knew she could take so much  you dump out of that i'm coming i'm coming down the hall and i'm gonna punch you in the face  because that means nothing do you get it it means nothing he just cursed at you  he just told you to go f yourself look i get them all going i get them going 
[00:08:30]  sit down bye bye so uh craig comes in and informs us of this  now what these girls want to do we have spoken about on the air it's obvious to our listeners  what they want to do and we're not children in here no matter how what our humor  know why it's i believe i know why it's obvious to our faithful listeners because we have come up with  an entire new language yeah yeah a new language that uh the fcc doesn't acknowledge it just this 
[00:09:00]  program and its listeners know what these secret little words are and now because uh craig knows  them and jeremy the pd and ken the gm know what these terms are they think everyone knows and that  if a transcript were sent to certain people we'd be in trouble when in the the reality of the whole  thing is no we wouldn't they'd read it and go what does this even mean what does that mean what is  yellow discipline what is that what is cleveland steamer it's beating someone with a summer squash 
[00:09:30]  it could be it's yellow it's discipline no one knows what it means a cleveland steamer i used to ride  the old cleveland steamer down the river toot toot oh yeah oh it's a 310 the old cleveland steamer's  pulling into uh the station choo choo hey huck finn let's jump on the cleveland steamer  it's ridiculous but uh we described what these girls want to do 
[00:10:00]  um and and instead of having faith in what we have done here over the years and the success we've  had thanks to the listeners and everything uh no they just say no can't do it and the mean opiate  this revelation it's like i remember when they used to say that and we did it anyway they slowly start  chipping away and it stops ow right here well you got to tell everyone what happened when well yeah 
[00:10:30]  when craig said you guys can't do that today like what we've been talking about for two weeks and  you're gonna rain on our parade today the girls came all the way from cleveland they drove eight  hours opi stands up and uh as his skin started turning green his shirt ripped off because he was  getting bigger you wouldn't like me when i'm angry um there are obscenities i can't even mention and  then he picks the phone up and goes to throw it through the glass window down onto 57th street 
[00:11:00]  the only reason i was i was throwing that way i was trying to rip it right out of the wall well the  wire thank god caught the uh forward momentum of the phone and directed it back down to where it  smashed into the uh the irradiator um i guess it didn't satisfy you enough so then you had to get  up and kick the garbage pail into craig three three garbage pails but who's counting yeah yeah so uh 
[00:11:30]  then we started uh and i threw my wallet you threw your wallet whatever i could find hell are you doing  i finally hit reached my limit and then we just said you know whatever it takes go back and make it  work you don't just say no you call up you make it work and then we come back and do it so i was on  the phone with jeremy telling him we've done this stuff like this before and we know how it works  yeah the lawyers say they're not comfortable with this 
[00:12:00]  well don't you get that if lawyers a bit full of axle grease  when are they gonna when are they gonna get that if the lawyers are are comfortable with uh the opian  anthony show and comfortable with all the wacky little bits they're doing yeah no one's gonna be  listening right the chipping away tink tink tink tink oh there goes guess what's in my pants  tink tink tink tink tink tink oh there goes any uh inkling that the word was the f word

[00:33:00]  and all you people that were a bunch of pussies  and weren't willing to speak up  you'll be out of work going  what happened  what happened  but what happened  what happened  but what  i was in  but now  what happened  as you're listening to celine d on over and over again  light music on wnew  it's light any w  what i did exactly what everyone told me to do  and  well what happened 
[00:33:30]  near  far  where  blap  there'll be a short order cook somewhere  going well i used to work for this really big radio station in new york  ah shut up  shut up and get me my platter  get the fries up  this is not the best breakfast i ever had  what happened 
[00:34:00]  what happened  it's all prepared the same way  god it's easy to say no  right  that's real easy  you gotta just uh  lay it out there sometime  the hard part  and where the talent is  is doing some of this stuff  and figuring out a way  how you know  where you can do it  anyone can say no  it's easier that way  oh guys you want to do that today  oh no no no no  come up with something else  that isn't edgy 
[00:34:30]  or entertaining  i have an idea  if you want to get someone on the drum  this is going to be good  you get a bunch of girls in  and like they bounce the beach ball  and whoever drops the beach ball first  goes on the drum  well as far as lawyers go  that would be great  because uh  everyone knows how entertaining lawyers are  they know  they know  they know better  i'm just so insulted that uh  craig came into our office today  and it wasn't even  it wasn't even open for discussion 
[00:35:00]  it was like guys  we just can't do this today  not why  not  you know uh  we have a problem with this  maybe we should all go and talk to ken or jeremy  it was so matter of fact like  i'm doing my job  we just can't do it  can't do it  so you guys are going to have to come up with another half hour radio today  that is going to be just as thrilling  as the great idea you came up with  carol miller on light new  it's all about the music  i know one thing 
[00:35:30]  i'll go out fighting  hope other people will  when we're somewhere else  i will  i will openly laugh  i don't care when the nice big uh  big gleaming luxury liner  pulls up on side of this sinking mess  and we climb aboard  and grab that champagne off the tray  and watch this hulk just sink  as we toast  ding  watching the  all these a-holes slip underneath the briny blue  and i'm sure someone will be carrying our luggage 
[00:36:00]  all of it  broken phones and all  i guys can't do that today  nah i can't do that  it's no big deal  i know you've been talking about it for two weeks and stuff  but uh  i'm going to tell you about an hour  hour and a half before show time  that that's not happening today  just reach your little hand  into the cash register  i'm sure your ratings will still be great  because you guys are so witty and brilliant  you'll just come up with something else to take its place 
[00:36:30]  just like that  no problem right  light n-e-w  all the best light music  all the time  on the new light  n-e-w  now celine dion from the  titanic motion picture  this one won her an academy award  i don't know the name of this effing tune  on n-e-w  my heart will go on 
[00:37:00]  but n-e-w won't  as n-e-w sinks  into  the murky depths  of radio history  there is a ship on the horizon  but it is only here to pick up two passengers  two lone survivors  i think we got some room in the raft  i see a few people i want to invite on the raft  rick we'll give you a board 
[00:37:30]  as the deck of the ship slowly slithers  we see craig asking jeremy what happened  as the icy waters pass his kneecaps  he was brave  he never left his dump button post  instead of sending out the distress signal  or doing something that may have saved people  he just kept dumping  as the cold water washed over his stupid head 
[00:38:00]  but there's the life raft  the opie and anthony show get on the life raft  and row away  so as not to be caught up in the whirlpool  that will suck everyone down  yeah he's so dedicated to his job  and listening to lawyers anthony  that if he was dumping  in a little room on the titanic  he would rather risk than risk  he would rather die  right  he goes down with the ship  he'd be a quarter mile under the ocean  still dumping the show 
[00:38:30]  he's that stupid  he wouldn't swim for freedom himself  jeremy has climbed up on a  a board  a door that is floating in the wreckage  but  he leaves ken stevens to freeze in the water  there it goes  but on the horizon  as the sun comes up  we see  a small life raft 
[00:39:00]  with the only  survivors  open your eyes  open them  open them  what has changed at this station  that is supposed to pull it out  from its doldrums  from its low ratings  what has changed  what has been implemented  that is going to turn this thing around  I say  nothing  nothing  from what time 
[00:39:30]  18 months ago  let's start with  I just picked a number  nothing has changed  nothing will change  you're  you're just  you're  you're climbing the stairs  you're leaving the flooded decks  climbing the higher decks  but you know something  the whole thing  right up to the smokestacks  is going  light any w  get used to it 
[00:40:00]  Michelle  yeah  turn your radio down  okay  immediately  turn it down immediately  well  turn it down babe  how's that  gotcha  there you go  how's that  what do you think  you want to play  yeah I want to play  all right  hit the song  I love this song  it's time to play 
[00:40:30]  it's time to play  it's time to play  hey guess what's in my past  It's time to play  It's time to play  It's time to play  Hey, guess what's in my class?  Michelle, you understand?  I can hear they play this song, It's Time to Play.  Yes, Michelle, how about you shut up for a minute?  You know how the game is played, and we will now play.  After you do what you have to do, after you rub the phone,  we will then ask around the studio, 
[00:41:00]  and we will try to ascertain what style you are sporting, okay?  Okay.  Michelle, if you would please utilize that phone.  All right, now do circular motion, side to side.  All right.  You know, we haven't done this in a while.  I've lost my touch.  What do you think?  I'm thinking...  Why?  Where?  Where was the dump?  It just happened.  Where? 
[00:41:30]  This, this, this is why...  It was, it was dumped.  Okay.  Thank you, Michelle.  I was just doing a little test.  What did he dump?  I have no idea what he dump.  What could possibly have been done?  What could possibly...  If you take that entire...  You know why?  I wanted that on tape to play to our illustrious leader, Ken Stevens,  and say, what the f*** is wrong with what we just did there? 
[00:42:00]  The whole set up, everything that wasn't one word uttered...  Mama's boy.  ...about anything that girl was doing.  Was there?  Was one thing uttered about what that girl was doing?  Nope.  Well, Michelle, did you rub the phone on your husband's whiskers?  Uh, yeah.  There you go.  No, did I?  Uh, I...  No, I didn't do that.  Michelle, I'm going to guess wood floor.  Yeah, that's what I would have guessed.  Michelle.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, pretty close.  Well, can we hear it again? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, let's hear it again.  And what angle would you like that?  Uh, circular.  All right, how's that?  I need a little up and down.  All right.  Boy, it's still so hard.  I need side to side again.  Good, I need circular again.  As a matter of fact, just keep doing that with the phone.  Keep doing it.  Don't stop.  Keep going.  He's dumping the sound effect.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Just keep rubbing. 
[00:43:00]  Don't stop.  Getting a good listen?  All right, how's that?  Don't stop.  Keep going.  Hmm.  Uh-oh.  Why are you stopping?  Could you go circular again, please?  I could...  I almost got it.  All right.  Michelle, keep going.  Hmm.  All right, up and down.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Don't stop.  Side to side.  Hmm. 
[00:43:30]  Boy, I'm having a lot of trouble figuring this one out.  Opie?  I'm thinking.  All right.  Up and down.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  Side to side.  Hmm?  Keep rubbing the phone.  Just keep going.  Don't...  Don't stop at all.  If it goes for an hour, don't stop.  Hmm?  I'm hearing that. 
[00:44:00]  Ugh.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Keep going.  What?  Hmm.  Interesting.  Opie and Anthony.  We're a bunch of perverted crackers.  Right?  Oh, what?  It's hard to listen to us trying to talk teen girls into doing stuff with each other?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And EW. 
[00:44:30]  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Is our delay built back up?  Oh, they weren't going to waste the delay, uh...  When the commercials were playing.  Well, here's the deal.  That, uh...  That was a perfect example of what we've been trying to, uh, stress to, uh, management.  When, uh...  Michelle called up for What's in My Pants, and we went to her on purpose. 
[00:45:00]  I did...  I never even made, uh, an inkling as to what she was doing with the phone.  The thing is, guess what's in my pants?  And then you heard sounds.  Sounds that sounded like, uh, razor stubble on a phone.  Uh, it's on tape, which will be played for Ken, our GM.  And all you will hear is, Michelle, you know how to play the game. 
[00:45:30]  We're playing, uh, Guess What's in My Pants.  And, okay, rub the phone.  I never said where.  I never said close to where.  I never hinted to where.  It was just, guess what's in my pants?  Rub the phone.  That could have been razor stubble on her legs.  Yep.  Let's guess what's in her pants.  Did she shave her legs over the weekend?  Could have been, guess what's in my pants?  Uh, is she wearing wool socks that are under her pants?  This is all I'm saying is the element of doubt. 
[00:46:00]  The defendability is there.  And they are so overreacting on that God effing dump button that I wanted this on tape to play for Ken and say, why was this dumped out of?  There is no God damn reason he dumped out of that bit right there.  None.  You heard a razor stubble sound on a phone without any description of where that phone was being rubbed. 
[00:46:30]  None.  Her husband could have had her pants on his head and then was rubbing the goddamn razor stubble.  That's how vague that whole thing was.  But for some reason, it gets dumped out of.  And I want to know what that reason is when I play that for Ken.  There you go.  Thank Michelle for helping out.  They just kept friggin' dumping and dumping, wouldn't they?  Loves his job.  Tony, what's going on? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, man, what the hell is going on?  That's my question to you.  They have lost all sanity with this show and with dumping things and with the perceived safety.  They have lost their friggin' minds.  Beyond ridiculous, this is.  What the hell is this?  Heck, sir, let's keep it to heck.  You might dump.  Norin, you rule.  Thank you, mister.  They just slowly take away a little more until you look back and realize, oh, my God, they're dumping out of razor stubble sounds on a phone. 
[00:47:30]  They are dumping out of goddamn razor stubble sounds on a phone with no indication as to where that phone's being rubbed at all.  At all.  Could have been rubbed on a goddamn fox terrier.  You stupid ass.  Now I want a goddamn answer.  Now I want an answer.  Why the hell was that dumped?  And you know what?  There ain't going to be an answer.  Because there is no answer. 
[00:48:00]  Chris, what's going on?  Ridiculous.  What's up, ONA boys?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, I know what you want to do, so why don't you just rub the phone on what you want to rub it on, okay?  Rub the phone.  All right, yeah.  Welcome to Russia, by the way.  All right, rub the phone.  Let's hear it.  How's that?  Wow.  Wow.  Not better.  Circular motion, please.  Yeah, do circular.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Okay, now side to side.  All right.  How's that? 
[00:48:30]  My guess is 8 o'clock.  What's your guess, Opie?  That's a 5 o'clock shadow, huh?  I say he shaved at 8.  Did you shave at 8?  Actually, I wake up about 6.30.  Ah, 6.30.  Okay.  Geez.  Now, do they dump out of that?  I don't know.  I honestly don't.  You know something?  I honestly don't know.  I'll tell you what loves his job he was going to say about that.  Well, you didn't set it up with the pants song, so it didn't imply that it's guaranteed. 
[00:49:00]  I will have this gentleman take his pants off and put them on his head, and then we will say,  guess what's in his pants, and he will rub the phone on his whiskers.  I mean, it's the same thing.  Anything for the show.  It's the same goddamn thing.  I made no indication as to where the hell she was rubbing that goddamn phone, yet they still dumped out.  That's how insane they've gotten with cutting this show apart.  And that made it on the air, what Chris just did?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  What if Chris was laying next to a naked girl and did the exact same thing?  Exactly.  Well, you know, you didn't set it up with the song, and, you know, if I would have my finger in a box instead of on the dump button, 
[00:49:30]  I might not be such a completely lonely zilch.  Jesus.  That's where the problem lies with this show and this station and the management.  You all got to hear exactly what the effing problem is.  They're dumping out of stuff that is completely ridiculous to dump out of.  There you go.  Although someone said with that last guy rubbing the phone thing, the San Francisco ratings are up a half a point. 
[00:50:00]  Just on what they thought it was.  There you go.  He thought that was fine.  So now I'll find out from Ken when he hears that.  And I know what Ken's going to say.  Oh, well, you know, you could do that.  Okay, you could do it like that.  Then we'll do it like that every time.  Then why the hell was it dumped out of there?  Why didn't he know we could do it like that?  Isn't he supposed to?  He's not a guy that's supposed to sit in that goddamn room and until Ken tells him something, it's either yes or no. 
[00:50:30]  He's supposed to be able to know exactly what we're saying on the fly, whether it is admissible, whether you can put it on the air or not.  Not if Kenny comes up to you and says, yeah, that could go, that can't.  Your job is to determine on the fly if it can air or not.  And the way that that guess what's in my pants was just presented is absolutely airable.  You don't wait for Ken to tell you you can or can't air it.  It just shows you how ridiculous it is because Chris could have had a naked girl right next to him. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  Could have had a naked girl and she could have been rubbing it.  There you go.  Could have handed the phone off to her.  How ridiculous this whole thing is.  They're taking it too far.  They're taking this whole safety thing where we got to make sure these guys don't screw up.  Don't drop the F-bomb on the air.  Don't do this.  Don't do that.  But they've taken it so far the other way that now it's just it's just plain ridiculous.  It really is. 
[00:51:30]  Crunk isn't a word, by the way.  No.  And it's not his God.  It's not his job to sit there and wait for Ken to give him approval to put bits on the air.  It's his job to sit there and determine if what is going over the air is a violation.  It might endanger the license.  And you know something?  That God damn bit wasn't.  It was fine.  But for some reason, he thought it had to be dumped.  And I want to hear what Ken says about that.  Absolutely. 
[00:52:00]  He won't be able to say crap about it.  Light any W.  You're going to love it, people.  All right, Dave, you're next to the O.P. and Anthony show.  It was a wood floor, right?  It sounded like wood floor.  Yeah.  I didn't even ask.  It does sound like wood floor.  I'm still an expert.  It was a Hitler mustache.  Do you think?  I didn't hear any variance.  No doubt in my mind.  It usually goes like...  And then the circular is... 
[00:52:30]  That's the Hitler mustache.  Oh.  And then the wood floor is just...  Very constant sound.  The second one sounded like we will rock you.  We will dump you.  Hey, guys.  You get it, Dennis the Men's Father?  Oh.  Oh.  Put that sweater on.  Hit that button.  Company man.  Sag it. 
[00:53:00]  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, Jim.  How do you feel about your hero, Ozzy, doing some wacky show sitcom?  Nah, dude.  Ozzy's been a contributor.  The guy used to inject Demerol.  If he's going to make a little bit of money doing a show, God bless him, man.  It's not wacky what he's doing.  It's interesting.  How many rock and roll guys...  At least he's not like Tommy Lee talking like he's from the hood, yo.  Ozzy's real.  Why wouldn't you want to watch Ozzy?  Do you want to watch Tommy Lee and the dead kid in his stupid beat next to him?  Floating in a tub?  No.  Dave, I got to tell you that...  Ozzy!  That show looks like it's going to rock on MTV. 
[00:53:30]  Of course it's going to rock, man.  Because there's some entertaining personalities in that family, I'll tell you.  Speaking of Ozzy, Jim got a care package today.  Dude, I got to tell the guy, uh, before you...  Brian, dude, I'm going to drink out of your mule.  Thank you for sending me that stuff.  It's great.  Be careful, man, because, you know...  Oh, everyone knows what mule means at this point.  Oh, oh, oh, I forgot!  Use some other livestock, please.  You better fix that little shirt collar under the sweater and hit the old button. 
[00:54:00]  Better hit the old button.  You could drink from his weasel.  Yeah, the old hole monitor button.  Hey, hey, you're running in the hole.  Little S around the old sleeve.  Hole monitor, S for safety.  And for suck it, company man.  Suck it.  Thank you, Brian.  So, what did Brian send you today?  He sent me, um, a box of, uh, video cassettes, uh, Ozzy bootleg video cassettes from, uh, early 80s and the early 90s and all that stuff. 
[00:54:30]  This is hysterical.  And some cassette, I'm sorry, and some, uh, audio cassettes.  The, uh, the box comes and it's loaded with, uh, videotapes, uh, of Ozzy, like bootleg.  So, we're looking at it going, okay, we know what these are all about.  And it looks good, man, when you're reading the labels.  Randy Rhoads, Ozzy 1992, you know, but...  Yeah.  So, we go, we, we, we go, throw one in. 
[00:55:00]  And then before it even started, we're like, because here's what you're going to see.  Anyway, the shaky, old, crappy, need a goddamn floodlight, uh, camcorders to get anything, uh, shaking at the stage.  And, of course, you know, stage lighting affected those old camcorders so well, it just left a ghost trail, looked like poltergeist, uh, all over the picture.  And, um, you'll hear the people talking, dude, this concert is, it rules, man.  All the, the talking in the background. 
[00:55:30]  And then you're ten miles away, unless the guy zooms up, and then it looks like it was being taped during the San Francisco earthquake.  But, yeah, then you hear the dude's like, oh, dude, pass the joint, man.  Yeah.  And then as the music's playing, the guy's like, yeah, Ozzy, Ozzy.  And then this friend's like, no, I don't think this is it yet, man.  You just hear this inane stoned conversation, which is hysterical and funny to listen to.  And then Ozzy hits the stage, and, and, you, you, everything's just shaking, and the sound quality is so bad. 
[00:56:00]  It's so bad.  We tell Jim to pop a tape in the back office, and he's sitting there bopping his head, like, trying to, he's really trying to sell it to the rest of the office.  Like, oh, this is cool.  This is so cool.  Shaking his head, like, really getting into it.  And then, as the song goes, he's slowing down his head movements, and, and you just couldn't sell it anymore to anyone else.  I really, here's the thing on me.  I used to help my friend Buzzy tape some of these shows and do the bootleg thing, man.  They'd never come, Buzzy, a good friend of mine from the Rochester area.  He used to go all out, though.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  He used, like, professional AV equipment smuggled in in a wheelchair.  Well, he was, we made, we made believe he was crippled.  That's how you get your stuff into concerts, by the way.  And then you get the good seat, too.  You get the crippled people seat.  Right.  Where, uh, no one's in front of you.  You've got to carve out your, uh, your seat in your wheelchair, and you put all your stuff nicely under the seat.  And you slowly pull it out and just start, uh, videoing.  They rarely check the crippled people when you're wheeling them into the concert.  Eh, who's going to check a crippled guy?  You meet in the bathroom.  Someone has a little gym bag.  You unload the, uh, the, the fake seat into the gym bag. 
[00:57:00]  You run one direction.  The other guy runs the other with the, the wheelchair.  Yeah.  Chops it off at the first aid stand.  Say, my friend is safely in a seat, and we'll be picking this up after the show.  Yep.  And you videotape away.  And while this is going on, another guy is, uh, sneaking in, uh, a tripod.  So you get a nice, steady shot of the concert.  And everyone meets.  And if you're smart enough, you buy your tickets ahead of time, and you figure out exactly what seat you need to be well protected.  Ah.  You don't buy aisle seats. 
[00:57:30]  You buy one in the middle of the row, in the middle of a section.  See the guy come in the usher.  So you call Ticketmaster, or Next Ticketing, and you say, I want F, F, and 14.  Mm-hmm.  And then when you get there, you bribe all the people around you, like, you know, watch out for the security guards.  And then what you do is you get the tripod and put the camera on, and you put a little, little hat over the camera, and a little coat over the tripod, so it looks like a dude.  Because they are looking for those things.  It looks like a dude.  That's good.  So it looks like Jeremy Coleman standing there watching the concert. 
[00:58:00]  We filmed a million of these things.  But they still came out like crap.  I don't mind that, though.  I own so much.  I got bootleg Aussie interviews from Detroit from, like, 82 before Randy died.  None of that stuff bothers me.  I got all the good quality stuff, all the professional videotapes, live and loud, all that stuff.  So I like the bad stuff, too.  I love the shakies.  I shouldn't be watching that concert in 1992.  It's a nerve of me.  I don't live in Allentown, Pennsylvania, but now I'm seeing what I shouldn't be seeing. 
[00:58:30]  But now you're seeing it.  So I love that bootleg stuff.  I love Aussie because he's never learned the lyrics to any of his own songs.  He has been butchering over the mountain since he was still touring with Blizzard of Oz.  He's been butchering that song from Diary of a Madman.  I'm telling you, that's why I love Aussie.  Because he cracks his voice.  I love your passion for Aussie Osborne.  I love Aussie.  Isn't it great?  So we pop a tape in.  Yeah.  Now, you've got to visualize the really shaky camera work.  Hey, the guys are trying.  I give them a lot of credit because I was there. 
[00:59:00]  I did the same thing with Buzzy.  I mean, Buzzy did most of it.  I was pretty much a mule for the damn guy.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hey, hey.  Mule.  Watch the mule word.  Because, I mean, he had it so figured out.  Like, he would, he would, his big one was Bootleg and Springsteen.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, big one.  Springsteen.  He was big into Bootleg and Springsteen.  And there was a major market for Bootleg, Springsteen, you know, videotape.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so when he got one done, because, you know, Bruce would do those four, five-hour shows,  when he had one tape complete, you know, we had other people set up in other parts of 
[00:59:30]  the arena.  They would have to come by to grab the tape.  So even if he got caught, he still was leaving the show with some Bootleg Bruce Springsteen.  It's like a good pickpocket.  You pick it, and then you do the instant handoff to somebody.  So you never get caught.  So I understand.  I understand the thrill of what these guys are doing and stuff.  Is it kind of like when you hit a dump button and immediately pass the blame on to a higher  up?  Not me.  Same thing.  Right.  You never know where it really came from. 
[01:00:00]  I just like when the lights came on, and it took like 15 to 20 seconds for the old camcorder  to recover from the light hitting the lens.  And then he just used to plaster it with white light, and it would slowly fade into the contrast.  And he had to zoom in so much that any movement by the cameraman was greatly exaggerated.  Oh, forget about it.  You zoom in.  No, there was no fuzzy logic on those old cameras, man. 
[01:00:30]  Every little movement was translated into an earthquake-sized shake.  Nick, what's going on?  Nick.  Oh, hey.  Sorry, man.  My phone sucks.  Go ahead.  Listen, Norton, you definitely, you're God, but let me tell you something.  I hope you're killing me, bro.  Why?  Why is that, Nick?  Nick?  Why?  Because I've been doing this for years.  Why don't you just tell everybody in the world that we're doing it now?  Screw the poor fake crippled people.  I think they know what's going on.  No, man.  They're so stupid. 
[01:01:00]  Think about it.  These guys did.  Who's?  Look at the people who are in the metal lanes with their yellow jackets.  You think these guys know what's going on?  All right, Nick.  Well, Ixnay, why don't you get off the air?  Because you're wrecking it even more.  Opie, Hurt from D.C. saying, when you're bootlegging, especially just audio, be careful when you're dancing.  You don't want the recorder to fall out of your jacket like Rerun at the Doobie Brothers show on what's happening.  You mean, I'm going to jail for a fat kid eating popcorn?  We thought you were our friend, Rerun. 
[01:01:30]  They were all there to see the Doobie Brothers.  And Rerun had the old Panasonic tape recorder under his jacket.  But, you know, the Doobies were rocking so much that Rerun had a dance.  They couldn't get any goddamn black band on that show that maybe they could have earth-winded fire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why the hell is Rerun and Rod and Dwayne saying the Doobie Brothers?  And then he was jumping and Mabel King's severed diabetic legs fell out of his jacket.  Or the tape recorder, one of those things. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, Mabel has no legs.  Doodah.  Yeah.  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Look at Rerun go.  This is the music that inner-city youths were listening to in the 70s.  Oh, don't drop the recorder, Rerun.  Whoa, I just got flashed.  And then when you, uh, and then when he dropped the recorder, the Doobies stopped playing. 
[01:02:30]  Because there were only ten people in the whole diner.  They were playing at the diner, weren't they?  I thought it was a high school.  Oh, whatever.  They stopped playing, though.  I was so busy watching Fred Berry's moves.  Oh, yeah.  He could really bust a move.  So, uh, so we told Jim to pop in one of his videotapes of, uh, an Aussie bootleg.  Yes.  1992, Valentine, Pennsylvania.  There you go.  No More Tears Tour.  You shouldn't be watching it, yet you are. 
[01:03:00]  And this is, uh...  No, I shouldn't have been there.  I wasn't there.  And this is how it sounded.  All right, let's hear someone.  This is what Jim was so excited about in the back office.  All right.  The opening of the show.  I was just not even on stage.  How could you tell what's happening?  It sounds like the Blitzkrieg in Poland. 
[01:03:30]  I think I heard some Panzer tanks.  That's the beauty of it.  That's the beauty of it.  That's live, man.  I understand.  Look at the album.  You buy the CD, man.  I can hear the CD in here, but I like to hear it live.  Listen, listen some more.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't think this is it. 
[01:04:00]  I don't think this is it.  The guys don't even know.  If that doesn't say a lot, the guys don't even know.  You've got to listen to two dumb stoned guys as you're listening to them.  Oh, wait.  That's just a roadie checking the mics.  I don't think this is it.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Oh, no, it's not.  I don't think that's it.  Oh, God. 
[01:04:30]  Try and lower it.  You have to lower it more than that.  Oh, awesome.  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  The tripod, the eyepiece.  What does he say?  He goes, you've got to lower it.  You've got to lower it.  Not the tripod, the eyepiece.  The eyepiece.  The eyepiece.  It's like frigging Francis Ford Coppola's there.  They're still signing it.  They're still setting up the shot.  But I can understand everything that's happening in the background.  Oh, God.  I do.  I do.  I know everything that's going on.  It sounds like an explosion at a construction site. 
[01:05:00]  You know what happens with these bootlegs?  I got a few.  And after like five minutes, it sucks.  It's exciting because you're watching something that wasn't supposed to be taped.  You're like, oh, wow, look at Ozzy on stage.  Then you realize the quality blows so much you can't sit through this whole thing.  That doesn't.  Dude, I got a tape from like 1968 of Ozzy introducing Iron Man.  He's like, no one had ever heard it.  It's a song of our new LP.  Hope you like it.  Stuff like that makes it all worth it.  All right.  But how about this? 
[01:05:30]  I don't remember that part.  This is, I think this is.  I think this is like the intro tape, too.  Oh, is it?  I haven't even heard Ozzy yet.  Yeah, of course that is the intro.  That's why I say it's a bit, if you try to follow, it's a little bit very soft. 
[01:06:00]  Is that an airplane?  Oh, here it is.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, here it is.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Great.  This is great.  This is great.  I'm crazy, Bobby. 
[01:06:30]  Great.  Yes.  This is great.  I'm a f***ing hero.  You know what's great?  People are taping this off of our show going, dude, I got an Ozzy bootleg bootleg off the O&A  show.  Bootleg.  Oh, here it is.  Get so muddied out.  Well, that little microphone can't handle all that noise.  That little condenser mic that was meant to hear things like, blow out the candles, Susie.  A tiny little microphone sucked into itself like a black hole. 
[01:07:00]  Did you hear how it had to gate out everything?  Yeah.  It was all loud.  We got to just hear Ozzy sing real fast.  That's him.  That's Ozzy.  Yeah, man.  That's all you're going to get.  And that excites you.  You don't understand.  I love Ozzy.  I love Paranoid.  I got so many versions of Paranoid I can hear.  I can hear Dio's version if I want on Live Evil.  It doesn't matter.  I like the bootleg stuff. 
[01:07:30]  That's awful.  No, it's hard to understand, but I got stuff.  I got great, great stuff.  Well, listen to this.  This is the one from 94.  It's not.  You're pulling my leg.  Oh, sorry.  Leg, jump guy, leg.  It's a subway train.  Well, have fun with your bootleg tape.  Dude, I don't mind that. 
[01:08:00]  That's the first two minutes.  You're going to go nuts two hours into that tape.  I got a great 1980 from the Hammersmith Odeon in London with never-released songs on.  I love stuff like that.  Ozzy.  Thank you, Brian.  That was great stuff.  Hello, guys.  How are you?  Ozzy.  What's up, Oz?  Oh, you know, I heard that, you know, Jimmy had the bootleg mail.  I just thought, until I heard the quality mail, I wasn't sure how good it came out, you know?  Yeah.  Well, yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Do you remember that show, Ozzy?  Come on.  You know, come on, man.  Where was it, 92, man?  Yeah, it was Allentown, Pennsylvania.  I don't even remember half the albums I put out, you know.  You know, Allentown, no.  No, he doesn't remember, I guess, is what he said.  Isn't it funny?  Ozzy is even more understandable on the tape than he is in real life.  Yeah.  Actually, every time I call you, you insult me, man. 
[01:09:00]  I'm beginning to think, you know, you don't like me as much, you know.  No, no, we love you, Ozzy.  Oh, look, maybe I should, maybe, can I get you a pinball machine or something, you know,  help me have a better work relationship, you know.  Ozzy can probably afford a whole apartment full of pinball machines.  That faggot out dukes.  Wow, you're keeping tabs on that battle.  I better be careful, man.  I don't want Mrs. Doubtfire to dump out on me, you know.  Hey, Ozzy, where are you calling from today, man? 
[01:09:30]  Opie.  Where are you calling from today?  Oh, St. James, man, you know.  Yeah, of course.  Ozzy likes hanging out in St. James of all times.  Oh, yeah, St. James, Long Island.  Yeah, but is that really surprising at this point, man, you know.  Yeah.  Hey, were you doing that show from a helicopter?  No.  It sounded like you were doing it from a...  Sound of love, maybe the helicopter.  Are you talking about the Osbournes premiering what, Trish?  Are you talking about, you know...  Oh, the bootleg we just played.  Oh, no, it wasn't a helicopter. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, what is the Osbournes?  Is that a TV show, right?  Uh, you know, it's fun, you know.  It's just, um, like a reality show, you know.  Oh, really, Ozzy?  Great.  You know, I don't know, man.  I suppose it would be fun, you know.  Maybe I'll lose its flavor after a little bit, but, you know, it should be fun for a while.  All right, well, we look forward to checking that out on MTV.  Thank you, Ozzy.  Okay.  All right, man.  Great bootleg.  Have fun at St. James. 
[01:10:30]  I will, guys.  All right.  So cute.  St. James, Long Island is where Ozzy hangs out.  That guy is amazing.  Right?  You've already told us Ozzy's amazing.  Yes.  We know Ozzy's amazing.  He really is.  Relax, Jim.  Not going to make fun of the guy when he calls us.  Good, don't.  Of course not.  Or his bootlegs.  Bootlegs.  His bootleg thing.  I got a 78 bootleg from Newcastle where he's telling Bill Ward from It's a Sabbath.  He's telling Bill Ward he looks like Bob Marley.  You know how great that is to have on tape?  Really?  For me only, apparently.  But I enjoy it. 
[01:11:00]  I don't care who out there enjoys it.  There's a reason why the bands don't want this stuff out there.  Corporate greed, man.  Yeah, man.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Dude.  All right.  Anthony?  Yes.  The second bit of the day that'll be dumped out of.  Yeah.  On the way is Double LC from Cleveland.  Double LC.  She's going to attempt to qualify for the 55-gallon jump challenge.  She drove all the way from Cleveland.  Actually, she didn't even drive.  She took a bus.  She took a bus from Cleveland. 
[01:11:30]  Wow.  That's a fan of the show.  And a surprise guest stopping by today.  Yeah.  She used to be famous.  She used to be famous.  Not anymore.  But not anymore.  Can you guess who is going to be on our show in a few minutes?  She used to be famous, but not anymore.  Not anymore.  But I'm sure she's going to say different.  All right.  We'll let her in next.  And right now, we'll go to the F.U. line. 
[01:12:00]  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to my boss.  For every time he leaves the damn office, he has to call 45 times to tell me to do something.  I'm not your secretary.  Call your damn self.  F.U.  Next message.  This is Wiggy from East Boston.  I want to send a big F.U. to my brother-in-law, Norman, you rat bastard.  For hitting the pass and not sharing the wealth and not even talking about it. 
[01:12:30]  Scumbag.  Go F.U. yourself.  Next message.  This is a big F.U. to the Mets fan who left the F.U. about Yankee fans buying up too many tickets and shave.  What does that tell you about your loser-ass teams, you loser, bitter-jaded Mets fan?  You can't even sell out your own stadium.  F.U. and F.U. your mom.  Get a real team.  And as for gunning for us, bring it on, baby.  We'll spank you like we have every year.  F.U.  End of message.  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate? 
[01:13:00]  All right, let me get a little saucy here.  For the love of Eve, you bet.  Life serves you up lemons, you make lemonade.  We're a little out of control here.  Stop cracking wise.  Oh, my stars.  Go F.U. yourself.  Tasteless, offensive.  A lot of ass-grabbing.  Horrific and tasteless.  People going daft.  Just makes me want to stick a knife in someone.  Stuff you get here on this show.  Aren't we supposed to be trying to gain listeners, guys?  No!  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:13:30]  Is that a surprise to you?  Yeah.  And E.W.  Hey, we're back with The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Woo!  Let's go.  Hold on.  They're supposed to guess who you are.  Yeah, don't say anything.  You want to guess I can offer one hint?  No hint.  No hints at all.  No hints.  Can I say this person is hugging me?  And I'm leaking clear stuff. 
[01:14:00]  Wow, that gave a lot of way.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Doesn't even say if it's a guy or a girl that way.  I really thought you were.  Yes, it does.  Yeah.  I know.  That means it's human.  Maybe.  Or if it's not, it's still on the camp stage.  Before we guess who's in the studio, she used to be famous, now she's not.  It's the only clue we'll give you today.  But first, Anthony. 
[01:14:30]  Ah, it's time for the Oz Report.  Oh, my God.  The season finale of Oz last night.  Just, I had to turn away from the television.  I shunned the program last night because of the extent of a man junk that was on.  I only turned around from the game to watch when the murders were taking place.  Well, as you know by now, Fast Freddy Ass Butter. 
[01:15:00]  Fast Freddy Ass Butter gives us the Oz Man Ass Report.  Right, every week.  And by a man ass or ass report, he does mean just any type of nude male.  Anything that disturbs heterosexual men.  Yeah.  And he keeps track of it.  Prolonged man junk shots.  There were two last night.  And just, they didn't leave the screen.  Well, Fast Freddy Ass Butter, he figured exactly how long each junk shot was on the screen. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  The first one lasted three seconds.  Three seconds?  That seemed a lot longer than three seconds.  And the second one lasted nine seconds.  Nine seconds.  Actually, he writes nine plus seconds.  Who was that?  Keller?  Chris Keller, yes.  Yeah, he's on.  For some reason, he decided he was just going to stand there bare-ass naked.  Not even bare-ass naked because he was front was facing. 
[01:16:00]  With his yam bag just hanging down.  Jesus.  And then in the disturbing category.  Yeah.  It's the Keller Beecher man kiss.  Yeah.  Keller Beecher man kiss.  You know something?  I shunned myself from that, too.  The second I saw Beecher walking up to the bars of Keller's cell.  And he puts his hand on Keller's hand, who's holding on to the bars.  And then slowly their heads are coming together. 
[01:16:30]  And there I am looking at the screen of EverQuest.  They're making out.  Don't swear, you guys have been...  What, they opened their mouths?  I didn't look at that, Rick.  I'm sorry.  I've got to tell you guys.  You guys have been telling me I've got to see Oz.  I've got to see Oz.  I've got to see Oz.  So I'm watching the closing ceremonies of the Olympics.  We've got to talk about that eventually.  What a bore fest.  Nah.  Then I'm like, wait, I think it's on right now.  I turned to HBO.  What scene did you tune right into?  Dude, I don't know any of the characters.  No joke.  Is there some kind of, like, nun or something? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  What's her name?  Sister Pete.  Sister what?  Pete.  Pete?  Yeah.  She works the dump button here.  So she goes to one of the...  This is exactly when I tuned in.  She goes to the cell when they're putting one of the guys back in.  Yeah.  And he had his suit and tie on because he was in court.  Yeah.  And found out that he was convicted of murder and he's going to die.  Who's that?  That's Keller.  Keller, okay.  And that was the scene where he's just...  And all of a sudden, as she's talking to the guy, what happened in court today... 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Uh, he decides...  He decides he needs to be naked at that point.  Right.  Completely naked for an extended length of time.  Turns around and there you go.  Yeah.  My introduction to Oz.  Man junk.  Man junk.  Jeez, man.  That's when I tuned in.  Yeah.  And then shortly after the Keller Beecher man kiss with tongue and torso groping.  Yes.  Yes.  There you go.  And then Fast Freddy Ass Butter ends his Oz Man Ass Report for this week with this little thought. 
[01:18:00]  Surprisingly, no male on male anal blank for the season finale.  Right.  No, none of that.  It seems like, uh, everyone ends up in lockup.  Um, the one, uh, the guy from the Aryan Nation that got the transplanted gums and the dentist  screwed him over and gave him black guy gums.  I did see that part, too.  He took a razor blade, like melted to a toothbrush or something, and just started cutting his gums off.  Right.  Which is really disturbing. 
[01:18:30]  Uh, pretty much, uh, as I figured, everyone's in lockdown.  I don't know.  Everyone seems to be in solitary.  And, uh, what's his name?  The guy in the wheelchair.  Uh, Christopher Reeve.  Augustus.  Christopher Reeve.  Augustus gets, uh, shanked.  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't think he's dead, though.  Looks like he's dead, but I don't think he's dead.  Unless they say that they're dead on that show, they always seem to turn up in that goddamn sick way.  Did he die?  I don't think so.  If he didn't die at the end of the episode, he's so alive for next season. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, they shanked him.  He's on the floor.  They were going for his uncle.  And, uh, he's just bleeding on the floor.  And I don't think he's dead, though.  Uh, Freddie Assbutter.  Check it in.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got a question for you.  You know, with the, uh, season finale last night?  Yeah.  I'm kind of out of work.  I wanted to know if I could come over tomorrow to that meeting.  Maybe do a little, uh, location reporting?  A little ass report from the meeting.  You know what's new, Dick?  You know what?  We just effed ourselves, too, because tomorrow was going to be probably a good meeting, 
[01:19:30]  and now it's going to be a good meeting with some bad thrown in.  Hey.  Hey, you guys suck.  All right.  Hey, Freddie.  He's got to continue the report.  Uh-huh.  Why not?  They're going to rerun the whole series, right?  Yeah, they'll rerun it.  All right.  Well, let's guess who's in the studio.  Well, who used to be famous, and, uh...  And she's not anymore.  Sully from Long Beach and Vic from Merrick on Instant Feedback?  Yes.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave? 
[01:20:00]  Dave?  What's up?  This is us, Steve.  Oh.  Oh, Steve.  Yeah.  Is it that dumb, annoying, twat, bitch, Kimmy from Survivor?  Oh!  Dumb, annoying, twat, bitch.  Yes.  Yes.  Great, great, great.  All right, guys.  I'm going to...  I guess that.  All right, guys.  Hey, I was going to give that guy a prize for guessing.  Yeah, and then he, uh...  I was going to give him a prize for saying that.  Says something very obscene, and then, uh, leaves.  There she is.  It's annoying, Kimmy. 
[01:20:30]  No, Kimmy, you might remember her from, uh...  Which Survivor?  Yeah, we don't even know.  Australia.  Was it two?  Yeah.  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  It doesn't even matter, does it?  It was in the game show.  I think they're up to, like, Survivor 5 by the point.  I don't even know which one you were on.  I think we missed two installments, and they're up to five.  Yeah.  I think five starts this week, or next week.  Four.  From where?  Who cares?  I don't even know.  Oh.  So what have you been doing as your celebrity just fades and fades? 
[01:21:00]  Plummets.  To nothing.  As the celebrity, uh, celebrity-ness plummets more than the ratings here in New York.  I know, isn't that great?  No, I'm, um...  For the last Survivor, I was actually going out to L.A. every week.  I was doing commentary on Survivor Africa for the E! channel.  Oh, boy.  They just love doing that.  They take the ones from the previous show.  I know.  They let them comment or have little surprise visits on, uh, the second show.  And then by the third show, the first show, people are just, might as well just be dead.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But you know what? 
[01:21:30]  Who cares?  I'm having so much fun.  Are you?  Yeah.  Are you still having, uh, sex with, uh, with celebrities?  Are you?  No.  Yeah, you are.  No, no, no, no.  I'm seeing someone now.  Oh, you are?  I'm like, I'm dating someone.  Is it a celebrity?  No.  Of course not.  No?  Who is it?  Just a Long Island guy?  Yeah.  Really?  Imagine that.  What does he do for a living?  Bartend.  No, no, no.  I got rid of the bartender a long time ago.  Is he a tin knocker?  It's...  I don't know.  He hasn't fallen that far from me.  I know.  Trying to help the brothers out out there. 
[01:22:00]  That's what sucks about the people from, uh, these Survivor shows.  Yeah.  No one remembers who landed second on the moon.  No.  No.  Of course.  That's the first loser.  That's all.  Wasn't it Buzz Aldrin?  Who is the second?  Michael Collins circled.  Right.  Who is the second person to run, uh, under a four-minute mile?  Ah, that would be, uh, my...  Who is the first?  An African guy.  Our own Earl Fannister.  You sure?  Yeah.  I'll guess Sebastian Coe.  Sebastian Coe.  Ooh.  Good name.  He was great at, uh, indoor track, my friend. 
[01:22:30]  Was he?  Right?  I have no clue.  And outdoor, he did well?  I have no clue.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  Kimmy still looks really good, by the way.  Yeah, I'll give her that.  Really sexy.  There you go.  Bugs me.  You know, sex will do that for you.  So what does he do, the Long Island guy?  It doesn't matter.  Just what's his job?  I'm not asking for any...  No, um, I don't know.  You don't...  How long have you been seeing him?  Months.  And you don't know what he does?  He doesn't run a garbage carting business, does he?  Because then he wouldn't tell you.  I told you not to ask my business. 
[01:23:00]  You really don't know what he does?  No, I do.  When does he leave the house?  Do not...  Not very often.  ...about my business.  Enough!  Exactly.  Enough!  He doesn't leave the house often.  Can't you see the bruises on me?  All right, who's this?  I know who it is.  Yeah.  Joey Butterfuoco.  Right?  No, actually, you know me.  Has he run an auto body place out on Long Island?  Are you the new Long Island Lolita?  That's it, that's it.  I'm so joking.  It was such a joke.  Did you hear...  No, I don't care about that.  You hear that snort that came out of you? 
[01:23:30]  Pig?  The only time she should be snorting like that is when a batch just hits the back of her throat.  Hey, be nice.  We haven't seen her in a while.  I know.  It's good to see her.  Gary, what's up?  She's more annoying before than now.  She's more annoying actually now.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Now you got her.  You're insulting.  He's only 12 years old, Kimmy.  I know, and I listen to him.  Yeah, he's 12-year-old Gary.  Why are you going to make enemies with everybody on this show? 
[01:24:00]  Getting more bitter as the time goes by without a hockey game.  Come on, man.  He needs to be a little love.  He needs to know someone knows how to juggle balls.  I'll be quiet.  All right.  All right, Gary.  It's good to hear.  I say a bad for you guys now.  I want you to leave in New York.  But if you got to, you got to.  Oh, we ain't leaving New York.  We ain't leaving New York.  We ain't leaving New York.  I want you to laugh in Ken's face.  We're not leaving New York.  I know.  I just want you to laugh in his face.  I just might have to take him to a different subway. 
[01:24:30]  That's all.  Not much of a different subway.  Not much of a different subway.  No.  And tell that dumb guy to calm down.  All right, Gary.  Thank you.  All right.  See you, guys.  Young Gary.  Yes.  Oh, dear.  Wow.  All right.  So we have Kimmy in the studio.  We got to get Double LC in here real fast, too.  I'll say.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, yes.  Kimmy, you're going to love this.  Oh, yeah?  As long as you can be quiet and not describe it.  Oh, boy.  We can't, you know, describe anything that's going on.  I wonder if we'll have a celebrity six o'clock queef today. 
[01:25:00]  Oh.  Crazier things have happened.  You ever done that?  No.  On purpose?  No.  What have we done?  I did what's in my pants.  I mean, have you ever done the, like, you're with your guy?  Huh?  Whoever that is that week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And has any air ever escaped and made an embarrassing sound?  Air bubbles.  You know.  Made an embarrassing sound?  But see, the good thing is, though, he can just pick me up and go whoosh.  And I'm like, oh, it's air bubble.  Pick me up and whoosh.  Squish your belly and they all come right out.  All right. 
[01:25:30]  Play through.  You've got to play through.  Come on.  Like a rant.  Well, we're going to have you.  We want you to do it today at sex.  Oh, I don't think I can do it, though.  I'd have to be having sex to do that.  Yeah?  Well.  Well.  Jim's available.  Call him up.  Oh, you can do it?  I put my hand up.  Oh, she's putting her hand up.  All right.  Well, this is Double LC, Ant.  Hey.  Yes.  How you doing?  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  And she's got, um.  I don't do that hey thing.  I hate that.  I know.  So do I.  That's why I do it.  What nationality are you?  I'm Puerto Rican, Sicilian, and Black.  Wow. 
[01:26:00]  Nice.  Isn't the Sicilian and Black redundant?  Great, great, great, great, grandmother.  I don't know.  Actually, my dad.  The boys, you know.  He looks a little bit black.  I love this guy.  All right.  Hold on.  Everyone's talking the same thing.  I've got another.  Now, hold on there, Double LC, because we've got breaking news here.  Stalker Patty.  Hi.  How are you?  I hear you're very drugged up.  Yes.  I just came out of surgery and out of recovery a few seconds ago.  They were supposed to break your foot live on our show today.  What happened? 
[01:26:30]  You were supposed to break.  Oh, they said he was supposed to break my foot live on the show.  What happened?  You want to talk to the doctor?  He's here.  All right.  Put him on.  Hold on.  Hello?  Boy, we kind of wanted to hear the foot breaking.  Okay, listen.  I'm not the doctor.  I'm Ed the assistant.  Ed the assistant.  Come on.  You don't remember me?  Yeah, okay.  I remember that.  We kind of wanted to hear the part of the surgery on the air. 
[01:27:00]  Well, I've got to tell you, Patty was a trooper.  No.  Did she suffer at all?  She screamed unmercifully.  Yeah.  Was it just a local anesthetic?  Yes, it was.  Really?  Yeah.  She wasn't put under?  Not really, totally.  What is she on, though, as far as, like, drugs?  Just some basic painkillers.  What, like Valium?  Similar, yeah.  Yeah?  So she's all twisted?  I've got to tell you, all she wanted to do was listen to the show when she was in surgery.  How did the surgery go?  It went very well, according to the doctors. 
[01:27:30]  Where is the doctor?  They're running around doing doctor stuff.  I want to know what happened.  Were you there when they broke the foot?  No, I was outside.  See?  You were talking to somebody that wasn't even there.  Get a doctor.  I'll get you a doctor.  Put Patty on the phone and grab a doctor quickly.  All right.  Yeah, we want to know how they broke the foot.  Hello.  Yeah, we got Patty's hammer toes fixed, but the only reason we were doing this is so we  could hear her get her foot.  Hear it live on the air.  Her feet broke live on the air.  Patty?  Hey, Patty, while you're in there, you think they could give you implants and some type of 
[01:28:00]  shoulder structure?  Shoulder structure?  Yeah, I don't know what you mean by that.  How did the drugs feel, Patty?  You don't do drugs.  You don't drink, right?  No, I think I went out like a light.  Is this the first time you've been under the influence of narcotics?  No, I was eight years old and I had an appendicitis operation, but I don't remember it too well.  Who paid for that since you didn't have a family?  Oh, I don't know.  I was with the New York family at the time.  I guess they did.  Foundling?  A little coffee cup and everything.  All the doctors here. 
[01:28:30]  Hold on.  Just looking like Oliver.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Doc.  How are you?  What happened?  I thought we were going to break her feet live on this.  No, no, no.  Why not?  No, we had to be professional about it.  She did really well.  What happened?  She's got a brand new foot.  Now, just one foot?  Yeah, I hate to do it to you.  You're not going to be able to make fun of her.  Yeah, we only do one at a time.  When are you doing the next one?  As soon as this one heals up.  How long is that going to take?  Usually about six or eight weeks.  So, she's going to be walking around with one hammer foot? 
[01:29:00]  She's got one of those Velcro shoes on.  How did she just get more pathetic as the years go on?  How did you break the foot?  Yeah, walk us through the surgery with you.  Walking through?  We don't break anything.  No?  No, we basically just cut some of the bone and move it over into place,  and we put a couple of screws in there to hold it together.  What did you cut it with?  We have a saw.  A sawzall?  Yeah, kind of like a mini sawzall.  All that kind of thing.  It's electric?  Yes, it is.  And you just whoosh and, like, hack her big bony nub at the base of her big toe? 
[01:29:30]  Yep.  And then what do you, like, pull on her toe so it faces forward?  No, we just basically slide it over where the big bump is.  We slide it over to make it nice and straight,  and then we put a couple of screws in there to keep it like that.  Put some screws in her foot?  Yeah.  I'm going to come with the...  She's going to set off the metal detectors at the airport.  Oh, and on the feet.  Boy, it's not like they check that area with the wand anymore.  Yeah, right?  What drugs did he give her?  I'm sorry?  What drugs did he give her?  We just gave her, like, a Valium to kind of make her a little drowsy,  and we numbed up her foot with some Novocaine just like a dentist would. 
[01:30:00]  God damn.  And you cut right through the skin and everything?  Oh, yeah.  That's what we do.  Holy ass.  Wow, that's something.  And then what?  You just stretch the skin around where you cut the chunk out of?  Yeah, pretty much.  It all just pretty much comes back together, and the excess skin will just...  Snaps back into place.  I'm sorry?  It snaps back into place.  That's it.  We fixed it.  She looks real good.  How long did it take?  The surgery took about an hour and a half.  Yeah.  All right.  So now she's ready to wheel on out of here.  She's got one of those funky shoes on,  and she's going to see me in a couple of days. 
[01:30:30]  We'll let you know how she's doing.  She's got the big clunky shoe?  Yeah, the big black Velcro shoe.  Oh, what a ant.  The big black Velcro shoe, her shaved head, her ant-like body.  Oh, my God.  I'll tell you, Patty, it's a tough room.  Just do her a public service and throw her in front of a subway train.  Hey, Doc, you need a plug?  Because I know you're helping out Patty with this.  I'm sorry?  You need a plug or anything?  You want to plug your practice?  Oh, yeah.  People can get in touch with us at 516-889-0969.  And you take care of hammer toes and other foot problems? 
[01:31:00]  We do it all.  And that number again?  516-889-0969.  That's East Coast Podiatry Associates.  You have a website, sir?  I'm sorry?  A website?  Right now, it's woundcare.tv.  Wound?  Wound care?  Oh, I thought he said wound care.  No, not wound care.  No.  .tv?  Yeah, he went for that lucrative .tv thing.  .com is just a fad.  Yeah, you've got to be different, you know?  .tv.  As in tranny?  Transvestite. 
[01:31:30]  All right, let's get Patty back on the phone.  All right, guys.  Talk to you soon.  Thank you.  Stay well.  Thanks for helping her out.  You got it.  Lord knows she needs it.  Hello.  Hey, Patty.  Hey.  Hey.  Now, you're going to have very beautiful feet.  Yeah.  Yes.  You're walking around with that boot.  Are you going to be limping for a while?  Yeah, well, I have crutches.  In fact, I'll come by the cell once.  You're going to be on crutches?  She is more pathetic than Dustin Hoffman in Midnight Cowboy, Patty. 
[01:32:00]  You know, wet herself on the bus.  What?  At least not make fun of my hammer toes in my own goddamn house.  I went to the bathroom.  Faggot stuff for Jackie's.  How did the Valium feel?  What?  How did the Valium feel?  Why does she have to say what every single time?  What?  What?  It felt kind of nice.  I relaxed.  The next thing I knew, I was under.  And then I woke up, and I was like, did you do it yet?  Didn't it make, Patty, when you took those drugs, didn't it make your life feel a little better? 
[01:32:30]  You can have that all the time.  We'll just get you drugs.  See how good drugs are?  Oh, I don't think I'm going to start doing drugs.  Why?  It'll make you forget how miserable your little life is.  That even with two perfect feet, the chassis that sits on it is still the biggest piece of crap.  Oh, no, not.  Very funny.  Oh, my God.  Putting an old rusted Rambler on top of brand new Pirellis. 
[01:33:00]  All right, so nothing happened while you were on the Valium, huh?  No, I just went to sleep for a little while.  She was hoping to be diddled.  I had my beanie baby in my hand for security purposes, and that was it.  You should have held one of the Yates children.  Yep.  All right, you waste.  You're a helpless bitch.  You know that?  Too bad the doctor didn't put the Novi-Kan in your throat. 
[01:33:30]  She could have died and take a hammer and shove it in your head.  She would have banged out all the dents you have in your head, you stupid bitch.  Huh?  Oh, tell Kimmy I said hi.  Die.  Tell him.  Put him on the table and put you to sleep for good, you bitch.  All right, all right, Frenchie.  You don't want to burn you out, Frenchie.  I don't want to burn you out.  He didn't have his heart into that one.  Yeah, he needs to take a little break.  It was too easy.  Yeah.  He almost didn't feel that.  He couldn't even, you know, she's weak and awful with rotten feet.  Doped out and sloped shoulder. 
[01:34:00]  Right now my foot feels like a block of cement.  Shut it, stupid.  Aw.  It's so numb.  Spike from Cleveland's got a great suggestion.  I think I'm going to say it right now.  Patty?  Yes?  We're not paying for the other foot.  Oh, God!  I'm serious.  You know how much that surgery is?  I'm sure it's very reasonable at that practice, but you can't afford anything.  You're stuck with one hammer foot.  Enjoy it, Quasimodo.  Just like Rico Rizzo with the one bad foot. 
[01:34:30]  The one bad gimpy foot.  She'll be all out of whack.  Let's give her a bucket and then send her loose on the streets of New York.  We'll put you on a corner so you can beg for money for the second operation.  Yeah, with your bad foot.  Could you please put her in a white suit?  A little black shoe?  That's what I just see her running around New York.  Just a mess.  She's such a mess.  All right, Patty.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  I'll see you Thursday with my crutches and everything. 
[01:35:00]  I'll hobble on over.  Goodbye.  Bye, Patty.  Okay, bye-bye.  It's going to cost me a lot more because I have six feet to do being an insect.  Look at you.  Oh, my God.  Kim just changed shirts in the studio.  That was very lovely.  Thank you.  Nice brassiere.  Thanks for that.  I'm loving this shirt.  What, we couldn't get somebody from Real World 3?  Oh, come on.  Those people are older than me now. 
[01:35:30]  Are they?  Yeah, Real World 3.  What are they on?  Like season 15?  Yeah, that was like 18 years ago, I think.  That was very 80s.  All right.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  All right.  We're going to say hi to Double LC again from Cleveland.  Yeah.  She's going to attempt to do something to get into the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Have you been preparing?  I have.  Okay, very good.  She's been preparing.  Can I help with the torture?  There's no torture.  You can help if you want.  I have to hold her legs.  Well, we better set up the studio because we're going to do it next, okay? 
[01:36:00]  Great.  Stay there.  I've got to get to her.  Let's go.  Rain Wreck Radio.  Like a bunch of people cheering on a rake.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Opie scum.  Anthony.  Slime.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Old friend stopped by the studio today.  Kimmy.  From Survivor 4 or 5.  I don't know.  Which one is she from?  The second one.  Wasn't she actually on the last season of the Brady Bunch? 
[01:36:30]  Where was she from?  Some TV show.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  A long time ago.  It doesn't matter.  Kimmy was bitching to me during commercials that she wants to wow guys, but they forget  that they have a wow sticker on their car.  Yeah.  Like she wowed a guy that had a wow sticker and the guy freaked out.  Like he looked offended?  He looked offended.  This guy was like 50 years old in like a pickup truck.  And I guess it wasn't his truck, you know?  He was sitting there going, boobs.  The man just almost drove off the side.  Lucky guy.  I know.  I know.  I haven't been wowed in a year. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, I'm wowing all the time.  I mean, look at the weather.  I know that wow is more important during the summer and spring.  Well, it's right around the corner, though, now.  But you know what the good thing is?  Two more weeks and we'll start it up hardcore.  Because you always get very nice perky nipples when it's time.  Oh, really?  You know, it's time for the night.  Are we allowed to say that in?  Probably not.  No.  I'm sorry.  Probably not.  No.  Kim, I'm sorry.  Don't describe anything that might be heterosexual and pleasurable.  Yeah, yeah.  Fun stuff that everyone likes and enjoys.  Have a mouthful of man junk.  Can you say that, sweater boy? 
[01:37:30]  Sure you can.  I got a big mouth and a big foot to put in it.  Can you flash Jimmy Norton?  I won't touch it.  Oh, Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton has washed me down.  Do you know I still find sprinkles in the shower from the...  Oh, that's right.  You washed Kimmy down.  Those are nice, aren't they?  Celebrity boots.  I was very nice to Kimmy.  Yes, he was very, very good after the whipped cream bikini episode.  You have no idea how many teeth I knocked out on my date that night.  Just angrily punching her.  Yeah, you had to wash, like, really sensitive areas.  It winked at me.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  Right here.  All I know is...  Read my lips.  I looked in the bathroom.  She was covered with whipped cream.  It actually said, no, no taxes.  Topical.  I looked at...  Why?  I had 20-02 when I'm doing that reference.  I look in the bathroom.  She's bent over, holding onto the sink.  And she had whipped cream everywhere.  And Norton was cleaning the whipped cream off her.  Norton did such a good job.  I mean, everywhere.  And she's just holding onto the sink, bent over.  I look in, and Norton's on his knees, wiping whipped cream off. 
[01:38:30]  And I'm just like, oh, Jesus.  Look at this position this guy's in.  With a moist towelette and a very delicate area.  And it was very warm.  It was warm.  And here's what I was doing, too.  I was just a scumbag.  It was like a regular paper towel like this.  Yeah.  So I would open it up so it was as thin as it could possibly be.  Oh, my God.  And put the warm water on it.  It was so good.  Peel the quilting apart so it was just one ply.  It didn't even feel like...  It felt like I just had, like, a little bit of burn victim skin on the top of my hand. 
[01:39:00]  It's a little thin, wet sheet.  Nice.  I'd see something fun again.  Oh, yeah.  Six o'clock queef.  No, I can't...  I don't know.  That's no good.  The old Kimmy would have done it in a heartbeat.  No, no.  You know what?  Because I can't.  It's more of a talent thing.  Yeah.  It's like asking someone to sing opera.  You can't just do it.  You have to prepare.  You know, you've got to get in the mood.  You've got to have some things to juggle in your hands.  Hey, I saw Double LC completely naked in the bathroom.  You did, did you?  She's a fine specimen. 
[01:39:30]  Wow.  How'd you see that?  I guess she doesn't believe in locking doors.  The lock on the bathroom door, yes.  When she goes into a bathroom.  Yes.  Well, she did after you, and your little blonde locks peeked in, and of course, I ran over with  my fat bosoms, and it was locked by the time I got there.  I'm too late and a dollar short, aren't I?  My appendix scar.  We all head to the bathroom when the commercials hit, and then she was in there, and she decided  that she didn't need the door locked when she was completely naked.  Yeah.  She's from Cleveland, and she's going to try to get into the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[01:40:00]  She's getting ready as we speak.  But Limo Ann has a problem today for some odd reason.  What's his problem?  I have no idea.  Limo Ann.  Annoying laugh, Anthony.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  What's up, bro?  Everything well?  I'm doing all right, man.  They were coming to say hello to me at the rink the other night.  What rink?  Over at the, what is it?  What is he babbling?  At the downtown.  What are you babbling about now?  Listen.  Shut your mouth.  Frenchie.  Jerk off.  I got a problem with you, Frenchie.  Suck it.  Really?  Yeah.  I got a real big problem with you, brother.  You will. 
[01:40:30]  You will.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you will.  You're going to put it in my mouth?  Nah, you don't know that.  Frenchie, let me tell you something.  Why?  You better stop picking on people the way you're picking on people that way.  Shut your whore.  No way, I'm not.  Yeah, if you faggot.  You faggot, you faggot, you faggot, you meatball.  That's all you say, brother.  You say to everybody, you ain't nothing.  You a meatball, faggot.  You ain't nothing, brother.  I forgot that these two went at one.  I know.  You and you stupid cannoli, shove it up your way, you douche.  Oh, you like that, huh?  Yeah, I'm your Italian specialities. 
[01:41:00]  You stupid ass.  That's all you say, my bad.  You and you ball of pasta, I want you to sit on it, you douchebag.  My bad.  Yeah, my bad.  Yeah, my bad.  In your ass, bitch.  Limo bus, 1-800.  Really?  Go F you self, bitch.  Yeah, what do you do?  Let me tell you something right now.  I got a problem with you.  You drive a bus, you kill yourself with it.  When I come see you, you're going to be scared, brother.  Drive around with a grenade in your hand.  When I come see you, you're going to be scared, brother.  And sit on it and blow up like a piece of garbage that you are. 
[01:41:30]  You sick F.  Hey, what do you do?  What did you cook another rat, dummy?  Why don't you take your son with you?  Take both of you ass, you douche.  Cook another rat, you dumbass.  What are you known for?  Take you a gumball machine in your ass, too, you bitch.  All right, hold on a second.  When I go in, I'm going to twist you.  Hold on.  It would be nice for Frenchy to do this live to someone, you know?  Yeah.  Your son is a fag.  A lot of people claim that Frenchy hides behind the microphone, Ann, when these people  are on the phone.  Yeah.  You bitch.  You want me, Frenchy?  What did you say about his son?  What did you say about what?  What? 
[01:42:00]  You didn't hear that?  No, what did he say?  Well, I think he should repeat it.  What did he say?  Your son is a little faggot.  Oh, man.  Oh, holy.  My son is what?  My son is what?  Hey, look who's here.  What is the steroid?  Hey, that's your son.  He got big.  Yummy.  My son is what? 
[01:42:30]  Why are you picking on me all the time?  I got a little good...  Because you're fun to pick on.  Come on, brother.  I'm here now.  You got me?  You got me.  I'm all here.  I see.  Come on.  Let's play.  Frenchy, just say, I surrender.  I surrender.  Do you surrender?  Get the white flag.  Do you surrender?  Frenchy, turn.  Tell me you surrender.  See, I'm going to give you a nice deal.  Tell me you surrender.  Promise you.  I'm on World War III against Italy.  Do you want to surrender?  Against Italy.  There you go.  All right.  A little face off.  Give him a little flash.  Give him a little flash. 
[01:43:00]  There you go.  How's that?  Well, there you go.  Who's that?  We'll see her later.  We'll see her later.  What does that mean?  Who's the gal?  She's for you, Norman.  Norman.  This is Lulu, okay?  From Gallagher's.  Oh, yeah?  She's for you, Norman.  Oh, all right.  We got the...  All right.  From Norman.  Number one.  All right, let's go with them.  Let's get Double LC back in here.  Yeah, let's get her back in here.  You know what, though?  We should kind of clear the studio a little because I...  Frenchy almost did it in his pain.  Yeah, Frenchy opened up his eyes real wide. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, let's just get everybody that might say something inappropriate out for a minute.  See, he thought he was on the phone.  Well, he was on the phone, but he was right next door.  What were you thinking when you saw him come flying through that door?  Well, I thought my face was going to be in a wall or something.  A part of the wall.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  He's still red.  Yeah, I know.  That was pretty good.  All right.  We'll talk to you in a little bit, Frenchy.  We don't want to burn you out, so let's turn your mic off.  Yeah.  Don't burn him out.  Don't want to burn him out.  She was sexy, man. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  We have a radio show to do, though.  Double LC, come back in here.  Why couldn't Limo Anthony have been the guy that had to go to Jason Williams' house?  Why?  Why?  That would have rocked.  Double LC, why didn't you lock the door?  Lock what door?  The bathroom door.  I hear Opie walked in on you and saw you naked.  I'm sorry that you came in and saw me.  I think that...  Mom!  You knew that I was going in the bathroom.  What?  He knew I was going in the bathroom. 
[01:44:30]  I kind of announced it.  Oh.  She's a voyeur.  Yeah.  You didn't want to lock the door, though?  No, I didn't need it locked.  I thought, like, Jim was going to come in after me or something.  Hot toilet cans.  Jim tried.  Jim tried, but you wouldn't allow it.  Wasn't working out for him.  So she's, what, Italian, black, and Puerto Rican?  There you go.  How tall are you?  5'1".  And how much do you weigh?  113.  113.  113.  Very nice figure.  Big, huge boobs.  Oh, these little things? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, it ain't always about you, Kimmy.  No, no, that's what she's looking.  She's looking, going.  These little things.  She's hot, man.  She's got big boobs.  What size are those?  You know what?  I actually don't know.  I don't wear bras all the time.  Oh, you don't?  No.  No, I don't.  Yeah, she's cute.  Somewhere in there.  34, 36 feet.  Yeah.  Somewhere in there.  Those are full C's, possibly a D.  Yeah.  34 D, right, Kimmy?  They're a good handful, definitely.  Yes.  Would you like to come in?  Oh, Kimmy, what do you think?  A little far away. 
[01:45:30]  You want to go feel it?  You know what?  You'd be a good judge.  Go over there and feel it, Kimmy.  Feel her.  Be a trooper.  Tell us how that feels.  All right.  There goes, Kimmy.  Tell us how that feels, Kimmy.  From Survivor 7.  Oh, no.  Heavy, right?  They're a little bit perky, but if you put your hands right under, they sit right in.  They're good cuffing.  You like it?  They're good.  It's definitely a full hoodie.  Now, let her reciprocate on you, Kimmy.  Yeah, Kimmy.  They're in a bra.  Oh, yeah.  And hers are in a bra.  You like that, though?  Yeah.  Double L-C.  Feeling the charm in there, Anthony.  All right.  Now, pull out.  Take your thumb.  No? 
[01:46:00]  I've got to get something going.  I'm still drinking.  All right, Anthony.  You want to explain what's going on here?  We've got the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We have two girls qualified.  I think we have five spots left.  Yeah.  We have a girl coming down Wednesday.  She's going to let us pour lamb blood all over.  Yeah.  Somebody had a great idea if we could put some of the lamb blood in super soakers and shoot her with it.  It would look really cool.  Oh, that's a great idea.  Like you hit her and just leave.  Can I come back for that?  Like lamb blood.  Sure.  Can I be a shooter?  After you do this today, you're welcome back any time. 
[01:46:30]  Yep.  Well, if you do what you said you're going to do, you will be in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  She's drinking to help it along.  Help it along.  All right.  Yeah, that's a good idea for Wednesday, eh?  Yeah.  I like the super soaker.  Super soaker.  And then we fill it up with the lamb blood and we shoot her with it.  Yes.  Doesn't that look great?  Oh.  Just shooting her in the chest and in the neck.  And you put onions in it so she's, like, tearing.  All right, Ann.  So, first of all, you jumped on a bus from Cleveland?  Yeah.  That's great.  I went to Greyhound. 
[01:47:00]  My friends suck.  So...  Ah, what happened?  Yeah.  Well, my mom didn't want me to drive, and last night...  How many guys tried to pick you up on the Greyhound bus?  Uh, one.  The guy that I woke up, his hand was in my crotch.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah.  I know that guy.  He's on the bus all the time.  Really?  He's the hand crotch guy.  Yeah, his hand.  I woke up in my crotch.  You woke up because...  Being molested on the bus.  You know?  That's great.  What bus service is that, Greyhound?  Greyhound.  You've got to love Greyhound for your crotch-grabbing fun.  Your seats suck.  What did you say?  Just trying to keep his hand warm in the winter chill.  I would have grabbed his wrist and said, hey, guy, you know, now without my permission. 
[01:47:30]  Wait, was he an older guy?  I would have said, hey, guy.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  That's what they had thrown about the window.  I could have got something out of it.  Hold on, let's get to the story.  It might have been a little going on.  Was he an older guy?  No, he was a younger guy.  Probably, I would say, like, 28, 30.  Was he yummy?  And before you got...  And he was Arabic, too.  Yeah.  Oh, he was hiding a bomb.  Jesus.  He was trying to hide a bomb.  He got the bomb, right?  And were you guys friendly before you fell asleep?  No, he just, he said, hey, do you mind if I sit next to you? 
[01:48:00]  And I go, sure, why not?  And you woke up because he was...  I woke up because his hand was on my cross.  Well, did he at least finish?  No.  Wow.  I like her, though.  She didn't yell.  She just went, hey, guy.  That's like a bad 1950s reaction.  Morton's going to be taking Greyhound now.  Oh, yeah.  I think he just...  Try it with me.  I definitely...  He got confused.  He thought he was on a plane, and he heard during the terrorist training that you're supposed  to disable the black box so they don't have any record of what happened. 
[01:48:30]  And he just sounds like a very confused man to me.  I don't think he was really trying anything.  Something was lost in the translation.  Yeah.  Maybe the translation, right?  In those manuals.  Yeah.  You never know.  But...  Oh, God.  Well, so how long did it take you to go from Cleveland to New York?  11 hours.  11 hours.  11 hours?  Isn't that like a space flight?  When did you leave this morning?  I got on the bus at about noon.  Midnight.  Midnight.  Noon.  Midnight.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  Noon?  Midnight?  What?  Midnight?  No, I love the thing that I...  Because I had said noon first.  Noon, midnight.  Midnight.  Midnight.  I got on the bus.  On the bus at midnight, and you got here.  Yeah, and I was drunk, and...  Yeah, nice.  And I passed out and woke up with this guy's hand on.  Guy's hand there.  That's...  Yeah.  Jeez.  Yeah.  Caligula.  Name the sound of the people of Rome.  Open your eyes, Caligula.  Right on.  Bravo, man.  God forbid I drink. 
[01:49:30]  Norton, are you holding my legs when I do this?  Are you better?  Yeah.  This is going to be great.  What she's going to do to qualify...  I'm going to towel you off after.  We can't throw her back on a Greyhound bus, though.  Nope.  I know.  That doesn't suck.  One of our listeners should drive her back to Cleveland.  Might be more dangerous than the hand-in-the-lap guy.  That's true.  A little more than a hand.  That's true.  You're better off going over to Pakistan to interview somebody.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Animals over there.  God, I just want to... 
[01:50:00]  Roof.  That angers me.  They're just savage.  Even though I'm sure he was, like, just one of those stupid liberal press guys.  I know how to communicate with these people.  Yeah.  I'll be okay.  The pen is mightier than the...  No, there goes your head.  Great.  Great move.  Good move, idiot.  And how you communicate them with...  You show them a banana, and when they go...  You pump a bowl into their heads.  I hate those...  What were they?  They're Pakistanis.  I don't know.  They were Pakistanis.  Were they?  I don't know.  It was in Pakistanis. 
[01:50:30]  Stinking Pakistanis.  All right.  So, let's...  Oh, right.  Where were we?  Let's get back to Double LC.  Yeah.  What's she's going to...  I'm working.  All right.  All right.  There's the first dump of this session.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let us just say...  I can't say that.  Don't say...  And don't say...  Why can't I say blank?  Yeah.  That dump again.  The dumbest mother effers on this show.  Here's how it works.  No, you can't say blank.  Oh, I can't say blank?  Blank?  And they say it. 
[01:51:00]  It's like, no, don't say it.  What?  Don't say blank?  Yes!  Oh, I thought you were able to say blank.  No!  You stupid...  Can I spell it?  No.  Can't spell it?  Can't say it?  Don't even imply it.  Don't...  Can I say sand?  Don't remove it 20 times.  You can't say anything.  Yeah, don't even...  Don't say anything.  We're at the point of never now saying a word about what we're doing.  Here it is.  I will say it.  Our listeners will understand what's going on.  To qualify to be in the barrel, you will do a handstand. 
[01:51:30]  Right.  And administer self-discipline to yourself.  Self-discipline.  The type of discipline that is administered to many men by a dominatrix sometimes.  It is that type of discipline that is going to be administered to yourself as you do a handstand.  That is all anyone has to know.  Bravo, Ed.  Can I say that she's a yellow-bellied coward? 
[01:52:00]  Ah, you can probably say that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, she's brave, so I wouldn't even call her that.  She's very brave.  Don't put it on a Greyhound bus alone?  I would...  Put out a visual?  No.  Really?  No?  No.  Don't even put out a visual.  Don't do anything except the thing.  You've got to picture this.  There's a guy with a priest collar and a mule in his mouth.  Yeah.  Working the dumb button.  Exactly.  That works for me.  That's great.  Yeah.  Norton will be holding her ankles as she does...  Is he going to have a face shield on?  As she does the handstand. 
[01:52:30]  That's what I don't do for this show.  And that's what she will be doing.  No more descriptions.  Let's just ask...  No more.  Is she ready?  The difficulty.  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I've got a couple more.  I'm ready.  All right.  She's loosening up a little with some icy cold Sam Adams, which is really good.  Wait, what have you decided to wear for this?  I see the wow shirt.  Oh, the wow shirt is actually coming off.  Oh, hey, how about that?  You know, I'm from Cleveland.  I'm not a huge football fan, but I do have a wow on a Cleveland Browns outfit that I have. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  Oh, it's good to be some kind of Cleveland Browns wear, Anthony.  Sure.  Well, here she goes.  I have a camel toe.  No, you don't.  Leave it.  She's got, like, Cleveland Browns panties on.  Wow.  Hey, look at that.  Oh, look at that.  And a little Cleveland Browns top.  Cleveland Browns top thing.  She's brown.  The shirt's brown.  Wow.  I don't know where the shirt ends and the skin begins, Anthony. 
[01:53:30]  You know something?  Let me see.  Turn around for a minute.  Wow, look at all the tattoos you got.  Look at the placement, Opie.  Look at the placement of those nippies.  I'm going to put everything in there, too.  What happened?  There's a piercing in there, too.  Oh, there is?  There's a piercing.  Wow.  Go, fish.  Camel toe.  I'd say more like sleet stack foot.  I love it.  All right.  Yeah, okay.  Well, we're taking pictures.  By the way, Anthony, speaking of pictures, we weren't allowed to put the Sandy Kane pictures 
[01:54:00]  up on opianthony.com for whatever reason.  Oh, no.  Well, you know why?  They needed room for the pictures of Jesus Christ, which are being put up on the website.  Amen.  Our Lord and Savior.  But we snuck the pictures over to foundrymusic.com.  If you want to see what Paolo did to Sandy Kane's Tuato, go to foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:54:30]  Why don't we mic her?  She's going to do a headstand.  I had to put my head to, like, completely to the floor.  We're trying to get her some...  Get a couch pillow and put a bag around it.  No, we can't have a couch pillow.  No, but plastic bag's over it.  Oh, that won't work.  Yeah.  This is not Apollo 13.  Make an air purifier.  I have a sock.  Wait, wait.  We're going to get you something.  We'll get you something.  For sure.  But you can bend down like that any time.  She's right there. 
[01:55:00]  We're ready to go.  Are we ready?  I want to do this and get this over with.  No, that's not the right answer.  Okay, here we go.  Jim.  There we go.  Stop molesting our guests.  Yeah, what are you doing, Jim?  What do you think?  You're on a Greyhound bus next door?  Get your hand away.  All right.  Something's down there on the floor for her to put her head on.  She is now doing a little handstand.  Now, pick her legs up.  There you go.  That's good.  Now, when...  Move out of the way, please. 
[01:55:30]  Now, remember, no words or anything, but do you feel ready?  I am so ready.  All right.  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  All right.  She's ready, Ed.  It's really hard to do this this way.  All right.  Don't worry.  Just relax.  Take a breath.  There's plenty of time.  Just everyone relax.  Relax.  Take a...  Relax.  Take a deep, slow breath and just relax.  Breathe.  Think of things like a running stream or babbling brook.  Breathe.  I could go tickle her.  A waterfall.  Breathe. 
[01:56:00]  Just relax.  Relax.  Take deep, slow, deep breaths.  She has her eyes closed, Ed.  Okay.  That's good.  She has her eyes closed.  All right.  Let's just get real...  Let's just get real quiet.  Just keep relaxation in your head.  That's what you got to remember.  Concentrate.  Yeah.  Think about it.  Let's just think.  Double LC is doing a headstand, isn't it?  She's doing a headstand and everyone just... 
[01:56:30]  Uh-oh.  Okay.  All right.  That's okay.  That's even fine.  All right.  Shh.  Don't say anything.  Is this even possible?  Yeah, it is.  Of course it is.  Look at her.  What's the matter?  No, she just doesn't want to pass out that way.  It's going to take...  It's very difficult.  All right.  It's very difficult.  Okay.  Is it?  All right, Ed.  It's very difficult to...  Right.  Well, let's just put it this way.  While you're on...  While you're on your head.  All right.  While you're on your head.  Some people get staged for...  I've actually had this happen with hundreds of dollars at stake. 
[01:57:00]  Anthony, the first try was not successful.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and we'll have Double LC attempt it for the second time.  That'll be okay.  And maybe you can have a little more Sam Adams.  You can sit down and relax you.  You know what I'm saying?  Maybe she's a little nervous.  She needs a little more Sam Adams.  Maybe.  That's right.  To relax herself.  Okay?  The Sam is a dual purpose item today for you.  That's right.  Let's go to the F.U. line.  We'll be back with Double LC from Cleveland.  Thanks for calling and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[01:57:30]  Hey, this is Mark with the big **** you.  Teresa in Buffalo.  You human pair quiet.  I'm tired of hearing your annoying voice.  I'm tired of looking at your ugly brace face.  I'm tired of all the melodramatic 16-year-old **** you bring around.  So be a team player.  Stop seducing my friends.  Go **** off me whore or something, you toddler slutbag whore.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to Dale, the 29-year-old faggot BMX rider from Howell, New Jersey,  and his stupid BMX riding girlfriend Michelle.  If you ever leave me a message like that again, 
[01:58:00]  I'm going to come over there and take that rusty little bicycle of yours and smash it up your gay ****.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Drew from Philly.  I'd like to send a big **** you to Brian.  Just got my best friend fired because he's a rat.  I hope the next batch of paperwork you work on is soaked in AIDS and you get a paper cut.  **** you.  End of message.  Dazzle Opie and Anthony with your brilliance now.  In New York, call 877-692-1027. 
[01:58:30]  Nationally, 866-277-4-WOW.  Opie.  Friend and Anthony and E.W.  And we're back from the Opie and Anthony show.  Hold on over there, kid.  Hold on.  I've got to go to Charles in Austin real fast.  Charles, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  How you doing, man?  Pretty good.  We don't get many phone calls from Austin, Texas.  I know this because me and the other guy that listen down here have to take turns alternating on lunches 
[01:59:00]  so we can get on this afternoon.  Man, you guys need to really break off some advertising that you even exist.  Yeah.  I mean, we wouldn't have known that you were here if I weren't flipping through.  I'm tired of hearing this family values crap on the air, so I'm flipping through.  I'm like, oh, my God.  There's got to be something on, and you're on.  It's awesome.  Oh, cool.  It says, though, on the screen that they only play two commercials during our show.  Yeah, pretty much.  It's a strip club, of course.  And apparently, all of us that you're a guy is the only thing that your market, because 
[01:59:30]  I was a marketing guy, the only thing that we're allowed to, I guess, buy are adult video  store commercials and strip club commercials.  So I guess that's the only thing we're going to go for down here.  That's all they've got running so far.  That's it, man.  It's horrible.  If you guys are doing bad down here, that's too bad because you guys are awesome.  No, I don't know if we're doing bad.  I think it's too early to tell for Austin.  But here in New York, we just announced our latest F-potion, as Ann calls it.  Yes, our latest F-potion. 
[02:00:00]  We're selling another F-potion.  Another F-elixer that has come out on the market.  Looks like Mr. Haney stopped by sales to drop off the latest F-potion.  Mr. Douglas, I have a brand new F-potion.  You're going to be a dynamo in the bedroom, Mr. Douglas.  Mr. Haney, how will this help me?  You'll put your C so far.  Now you know where I'm going. 
[02:00:30]  We're all about F-potions here in New York.  F-potions, a brand new one.  Brand new F-potion.  Hey, guys, you know the other thing?  Yeah.  The other thing could be that, term like this, there's no way this guy slid it in enough  to even be able to judge women.  Come on!  I'm tired of hearing him talk.  Period.  That's idiot.  That's just bad programming.  Nobody wants to hear that.  All right.  Hey, you guys, take care.  Norton, you suck, baby.  All right, Charles.  Thanks, man.  I'd like to hear from Austin every once in a while.  Austin, Texas.  Check it in.  Are we ready, or is Jim going to lose it? 
[02:01:00]  Oh, Jim already lost it.  Oh, my God.  Did you make a mess?  I'm really close.  Jim is molesting our latest guest.  Yeah.  And Jim is proud of showing everybody now what he's packing since he's been molesting.  Not bad, right?  Double LC from Cleveland in the studio.  Yeah.  I guess we're going to try for the second time here, Anthony.  Second attempt.  She's trying to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  She had an idea.  She's going to come down to a headstand and administer discipline to herself. 
[02:01:30]  That's right.  Yes.  And, oh, there she goes.  Well, let's see.  Hold on.  She's doing the handstand.  Norton is holding her.  And any time you're ready, relax.  Think of babbling brooks and whatnot.  Whatever helps.  You only get three shots of this, by the way.  Three strikes and you're out.  All right.  No pressure, Opie.  All right.  Just relax.  All right.  Relax there, Double LC.  Relax.  She's 5'113 pounds, black, Puerto Rican, and Italian, Anthony. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  With full-size D-boobs.  She's wearing a lovely Cleveland Browns.  Rick, move your head.  Braun panty type outfit.  She's always doing that to me.  And, well, Rick's trying to get the pictures, Anthony.  Well, whatever.  Jim was coaching her outside.  I was witnessing some of that.  It's not me.  It's right there.  I know.  It's right here.  Yeah.  It's right there.  Well, we see that.  Yes.  It's right there.  Mm-hmm.  It's impossible.  Hey, hey, do you want to start, like, down in the, like, and then Jim could boost you 
[02:02:30]  right up?  Well, let's go to Jim.  Jim is the expert, Jim.  Well, because she's very sincere.  It's not her fault.  What it is, it's a...  No, no, no.  You can't.  Hold on.  You can't.  You can't.  I'm going to go home and try.  Certain things your mind is telling you.  Right.  When you're trained to do something a certain way for 30 years.  Right, right, right.  You can't just do it.  So what I was thinking is...  Are we learning today that that's not possible to do?  It is possible.  It is possible.  But it's hard with 50 people and, you know, just staring at you going, all right. 
[02:03:00]  Well, maybe she needs to relax a little more with the Sam Adams.  Maybe laying...  I don't know.  Here, hold on.  Let me trust you.  All right.  Well, you know what?  Norton's going to try.  Hold on.  Anthony, I think we've got to be tough with our rules.  I think she has to, you know, with the headstand.  Oh, I do, too.  No, no, no.  Jim, I'm telling you, she'll be disqualified if she does it.  I was thinking, I was thinking, have her head on the floor.  I was saying, have her head on the floor, right?  But she's on her knees, right? 
[02:03:30]  And then at the immediate second of action, Norton flips her up.  Ah, good.  You know what I mean?  Good.  It's like priming the pump.  Yeah, we don't want to...  They call it priming the pump.  We don't want any cheating.  No cheating.  No cheating.  No, no, no, it's not cheating as long as the person performs certain lovely things  upon themselves.  Right.  You know, if you bring down the wrath on yourself, it doesn't really matter if you're on your  head or if you're on your...  Ah, no, no.  It does matter.  Yeah, we're thinking...  We set the rules, Norton.  No, you cannot.  It's impossible.  But if you're...  Hey, if... 
[02:04:00]  It's very...  You know what?  I am so full.  Yeah.  I'll say that.  I'm very full, and I can go, like, any second whatsoever, but it's very impossible.  All right, so how about we do that?  How about we do...  You put your head on the towel, get on your knees, and kind of in a crouch-like position?  Is that possible?  Like, you're in the woods.  Like, it just left a bar.  Ah!  Yeah, yeah.  Kimmy, how about you don't...  Shut up.  Shut up.  Big mouth for you.  How about you don't say a word during this whole goddamn thing? 
[02:04:30]  We are professional broadcasters.  Now, Norton, do you understand what I'm saying?  Yeah.  She does that, and then the second the action starts, you flip her up.  Yeah, and if...  I've got an explanation for what they want me to do.  I think you want me to, in the D style...  Yeah.  ...that way.  Right.  You want me to do it that way?  And then Norton will...  I can't do it on my head.  Norton, but then, what if Norton flips you up right when you start?  Yeah, then you'll be fine.  Yeah, see if...  Yeah, then you'll be totally fine.  That'll do it.  Try that.  Try that. 
[02:05:00]  And he's gonna get, like, totally done.  Yeah, well, you know what?  I've been through all this before, Tim.  Look at Jim comforting her.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  You know what?  This is like...  This is like paired figure skating.  Right.  They're gonna have to work together.  They're gonna have to work together.  Jim, you're gonna have to work together.  All right?  You're gonna have to work this together.  The move's gotta be pulled off perfectly.  Right.  We are allowing a...  Okay. 
[02:05:30]  All right, I'm coming over to this mic.  All right, so now...  There we go.  That on?  All right.  She's...  All I can say, Anna, is she's on all fours right now.  We're about to say that.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  And double L...  Put your head down.  Get ready.  Cleveland.  I can't have my head down when I...  No?  All right, all right, all right, all right.  Okay.  And then Norton will boost you up?  Yeah, there's gotta...  You have to help me, because I can't just do it or nothing.  All right, the second it starts...  As sexy as that is, there's legal responsibilities.  The second things get moving, you have to put your head down so Norton can lift your 
[02:06:00]  legs up, okay?  That's all right.  All right, there's gotta be some...  How many people are in here that I don't want in here?  No, that's okay.  No, there's no...  Yeah, everybody is pretty much out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Only show people.  Everything's good.  Just relax.  All right, concentrate.  All right.  She's thinking.  She's thinking.  Yeah.  She's thinking.  There you go.  Just...  Concentrate.  Concentrate.  That's okay.  Uh-oh.  There you go.  What happened? 
[02:06:30]  That's all.  What happened?  She's just getting into it.  Just making herself up.  All right.  Don't worry.  This is...  Everything's fine.  This is for a place in the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  She's just gotta clear the mind and...  Clearing the mind.  Take deep breaths and just think about...  She's...  All right.  All right.  There we go.  Go ahead, Norton.  Hold her up.  Hold her up.  Hold her up.  Hold her up.  There we go.  Okay.  Let her rip.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Yeah.  There it is.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Keep it moving.  Keep it...  All right.  Hold her up.  Hold her up.  Lift up.  All right.  All right.  Don't explain what happened.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah.  Okay.  A little bit.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  There you go.  Just finish up however you want.  My hair.  Yep.  No, you're okay.  No, you're okay.  All right.  Well.  Wow.  How do we explain that one to the kids? 
[02:07:30]  That was great.  What do you think?  That was something.  She was on all fours.  Something started happening.  So, Jim grabs her legs and lifts her up.  Jim quickly flipped her up into a handstand.  But, unfortunately, her neck collapsed and she almost was paralyzed.  Yeah, we almost paralyzed her.  Jim was too...  Oh, look at that.  All up her back.  Jim was too amazed at what was going on that he failed to realize that she almost snapped  her neck.  I was very happy.  Yeah.  Jim was like, oh, my God. 
[02:08:00]  Like seeing Santa Claus coming down the chimney.  Wasn't it, Jim?  Yes.  Yeah.  Bravo.  Damn.  Good.  And it's not that centered under the handstand.  It can't do it.  Wow.  Nice.  I'm going to try that at home.  Yes, it's at home.  It's a no problem.  You want to just lay down and finish on your back so Norton can see?  Yeah, you do.  Would you like for me to finish?  Well, I just want...  You know something?  The truth is, I want to see Norton's enjoyment.  Yeah, I got it.  Do I really have to?  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Come on.  Let me play. 
[02:08:30]  Go ahead.  This will just put it over the top.  There we go.  This puts it over the top.  Wait, wait.  Get the...  Yeah.  Go that way.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why does Rick have a rolled up newspaper?  No.  No.  Rick, relax.  Calm down, Rick.  All right.  Well, move it.  All right.  Pull that shirt down.  Rick's got a newspaper in his hand.  There you go.  No.  No.  Here.  No.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  There we go.  All right.  Let her rip.  Norton, help her out. 
[02:09:00]  Rick, move out of the way.  I hate you, guys.  All right.  I hate you, guys.  All right.  Close your eyes.  There we go.  Relax.  Relax.  Relax.  I think it will.  Relax.  Man.  Why is that?  It's not that kind of ideal position.  Can you get in a natural?  Well, then get in a natural type of position.  There you go.  Okay.  That'll work. 
[02:09:30]  Don't say.  Kimmy, could you shut up, please?  You're just saying things that a little, you know, she won't shut up.  A little hint.  It's everything she's said so far has been like, please don't say that.  No, no, no.  Do whatever you have to do.  That's good.  Yeah, there you go.  Just make sure Norton gets a good view.  Don't let mean old Rick spoil everything.  Yeah, Rick.  Yes, I do.  Mean old Rick.  Mean old Rick.  Okay.  All right.  We'll make a...  Oh, oh.  What do you think?  What do you think, Norton?  Yeah, that's really nice.  Yes, it is.  What do you think, Norton?  Jesus. 
[02:10:00]  Look at him.  Wow.  Thirsty gal, aren't you?  You like that, Norton?  Beyond comprehension.  Are you just enjoying the hell out of yourself there, Norton?  Oh, I love the O&A show.  Look at that.  That is so it.  Samuel Adams.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Look at that.  Now roll around there and throw yourself through the window.  Wow.  Shut up.  All right.  Yeah, we can't.  No more.  All right.  That is an event we will never discuss again.  That's it.  That's it. 
[02:10:30]  Thank you.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  I was looking.  Yes.  Yeah.  Look at Norton.  His face is all red.  He's so happy.  Hey, did Father Ritter dump out of any of that?  I don't think so.  Father Ritter.  That has definitely got to be in.  I'm going to turn off their mics.  Yeah, you never know.  Yeah, we want to show some responsibility here today.  David, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, man.  Listen, while she was performing the triple toe coaxial, whatever she was doing over there,  Anthony sounded like Bob Ross the painter, you know?  And we'll put a...  Just be careful.  And we'll put a happy brush.  I had her to be very quiet so she would stay concentrated.  Yeah, you got a dream.  A little happy.  What we're going to do right here.  Now I'm going to dip into my canary yellow right here.  And it's your own world, so you paint whatever you want.  But I'm going to...  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to paint a nice little river.  Start right here. 
[02:11:30]  Starts right up here.  And now the river's going to go down.  It's your world.  Remember, you just paint whatever you want.  It's a happy little river and it winds its way down here.  And I wasn't expecting this, but I have so much paint on my brush, I'm going to make a lake.  Right about here.  I didn't think I'd have enough paint to make a lake, but apparently there was so much yellow paint on my brush, I had to make a big lake.  So I just did that.  Wonderful.  Look, because it's your world.  Remember that.  You can make as many rivers as you want.  Where are you going to paint?  Now I'm going to put Jim Norton right about here in my picture. 
[02:12:00]  Look, his face is right in the lake.  He's going for a little swim, isn't he?  Where are you going to paint the bog?  The bog goes right around the back.  You can't really see, if you're looking at the river, you can't see the mud bog.  We saw the bog.  But if, no, I, we saw the bog.  But around the back, there you go.  Now it's a happy little mud bog.  Right around the back of the river.  It looks like the bog has a few marsh planks.  Hey, whatever it takes. 
[02:12:30]  It's your world.  That's where the logs live.  Bill, what's going on?  Bill.  Hey, what's up, Bill?  Oh, no.  Yes, speak.  Bill, let's go.  Hey, I just, uh, I just learned that you guys could do the PGA Tour on the weekends in your off time.  Yeah.  We were whispering there.  Yes.  You guys suck.  As Jim, uh, steps up to the putt.  That's right.  What is this idiot? 
[02:13:00]  What the F just happened there?  You had 15 minutes of nothing radio.  It, look, look.  If you can't tell what just transpired in this studio by our descriptions, by being familiar with this program, by Jim Norton, by what little things are being said, please find some way to buy a weapon.  Maybe not a handgun, because it takes too long.  Uh, you could probably get a rifle at Kmart.  Put your toe in the trigger and shoot your friggin' head off. 
[02:13:30]  Because you're stupid.  But that also proves our point, eh?  What?  What?  See?  No one knows.  Right.  No one knows.  We're very vague.  Don't worry about it.  Adam from Valley Stream, you're a stupid, stupid man.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's up?  Guys.  Yes.  Great show.  One thing I gotta say.  You've gotta make this 55-gallon drum challenge a pay-per-view event for all the freaking, uh, networks that you're on throughout the country.  And have, like, one of your casino sites put up, like, a million-dollar prize and have celebrities run around and pour the crap on people. 
[02:14:00]  It would be great.  All right.  Great.  Huge money.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you.  All right.  Great.  Well, we can tell you this much.  Double LC from Cleveland has qualified for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  She is in.  That was good.  We have three girls that have qualified.  I think we only have about four spots left, Anthony.  That girl's coming in Wednesday, and she's gonna allow us to super-soak her with, uh, Lamb Blood.  Lamb Blood in super-soakers, and we will shoot her until she is covered in Lamb Blood. 
[02:14:30]  We're gonna get that first pristine shot off, you know?  Just pump it up.  Just watch blood explode all over her naked bosom.  Why does that sound hot?  That girl better not blow us off, because that's a great idea.  No, because then we won't use a super-soaker, and it won't be Lamb Blood, honey.  So far, we had Double LC do what she just did.  Yeah.  We had the girl from, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Brockton.  But what was her?  Uh, Becky, right?  Becky.  Becky from, uh, Brockton who ate the Lamb's eyes. 
[02:15:00]  Lamb's eyeballs covered in chocolate.  And then her friend, Stephanie.  Stephanie from, uh, Taunton went into our disgusting bathroom here at the radio station  and dunked her head in the toilet as she blew bubbles out of her mouth.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's what we got so far.  Sarah, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi, Sarah.  Oh, wow.  Hello.  It's a great way to talk to you.  Hey, hey, turn that down. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, turn that to me, Dad.  Sarah, are you hot?  I'm sorry.  Are you hot?  Yeah, I'm very.  How old a gal are you?  18.  You're 18?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, you have to do nothing.  You're in.  Thank you.  I'm teasing, of course.  So you want to do something for the 55-gallon jump challenge?  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  Well, I was thinking about, I don't know, eating something.  Real nasty.  Maybe some cow's brain or something?  Cow's brain?  Something like that.  Eat some monkey's brain.  Eat like cow brain or monkey brain for, hmm. 
[02:16:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  What could make that a little better?  A little hotter.  For an 18-year-old girl.  If the cow was alive?  What would make that a little better?  18.  18, she wants to eat cow brain.  Will you do it?  But let's ask Frenchie.  Cow brain, that's kind of not a big deal.  Right?  No, not really.  I don't think I can get a...  What's a brain that'll really put it over the top?  I don't know if you remember.  She can scoop out the brain out of the skull like the last time. 
[02:16:30]  I boil the head off and I crack it open and I put a spoon in it and she can eat it.  Well, I like that idea.  Thank God lambs and cows don't carry mausers.  Right there, Frenchie?  Because you'd be running from them, too, instead of hacking their heads apart.  You should have done that with the Nazis.  We're going to save some of our boys on Normandy.  Just like the Italians.  Right.  Sarah, when do you want to do this?  Tomorrow.  On Tuesday.  All right, listen, Sarah.  Yeah?  Have you been listening to the O.P. Anthony show?  We don't like you ladies when you say you're going to do something and then you don't show up. 
[02:17:00]  I'll be there.  There was another girl from Cleveland that was supposed to stop by today to do something called a Cleveland steamer.  We're not even going to explain it, but that's what she was going to do.  Sarah, you do understand that you would have to come to New York to do this.  Correct.  Okay.  I thought she would be able to go down to the station in Cleveland.  You want to get on the Greyhound bus?  No, I haven't ride.  Oh, you do?  You don't want your groin touched by a stranger in?  No.  It seems to be a feature that has a special Greyhounds running.  All right, now, low fares anywhere in the country, plus a hand in your lap. 
[02:17:30]  Muffhound.  Freaking pigs.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Freaking pigs.  The dregs of society.  This lovely girl from Cleveland passes out.  She wakes up because the guy is muffhounding.  Right.  Oh, my.  Jesus.  Doing the four-knuckle shuffle.  So, um...  All right, you'll be here tomorrow soon. 
[02:18:00]  Yes, I will.  You're going to do this.  Uh-huh.  This will be the second girl from Cleveland trying out for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  And so far, no ladies from Jersey or New York.  Thank you.  All right, Adam.  I get your point.  You were trying to make a point of the over-censoring.  He's freaking out.  Apologize, you assed up.  You don't get an apology because you're a dick.  But okay, I understand your point.  I'm arguing with writing.  That's what it's gotten down to today.  Arguing with the instant feedback.  But I like that Adam was sticking up for us a little bit.  All right. 
[02:18:30]  Kind of nice.  All right, Sarah.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Okay.  Hold on the line for Rick.  Hold on.  All right.  He'll give you the details on how to get here.  Okay.  All right.  And we'll pay for gas money.  Okay.  That's great.  Ain't we something?  Paying for gas money.  Just here, though.  Right.  One way.  All right, hold on, Sarah.  Okay.  There you go.  That sounds pretty good.  Yeah.  Eating some brains scooped out of a skull as she sits...  I clock it open on funny.  Did we get her naked or in brawn panties or something? 
[02:19:00]  Oh.  See if she'll do that.  Sarah?  Sarah?  Will you do this?  Eat this stuff in your little bra and panties?  Um, in my bra?  Maybe not in my panties.  Why not panties?  Oh, boy.  Because there's a world of hurt going on.  Is there a world of hurt going on downstairs?  You got some junk?  All right.  Hold on.  You got some junk in the trunk?  A little bit?  A little bit.  All right.  How tall a gal are you?  Hold on, Sarah.  I'm taking out my chart.  The chart's coming out.  Oh, this chart.  And if you're not on the chart, you will be denied access. 
[02:19:30]  No!  She can't come in.  These barrels are only so big.  We don't want another Christy on our hands.  All right.  How tall are you, Sarah?  5'3".  5'3".  All right.  Cross-reference 5'3".  With?  How much do you weigh?  And be honest.  Oh, 105.  105.  I can tell you right now there isn't a problem.  Unless your whole upper section was removed in an operation.  Oh, no.  How big are your breasts?  Oh, geez.  I don't know.  36B, I think. 
[02:20:00]  Well, B-cups.  All right.  That's not a problem, Opie.  What do your charts say?  Yeah, boy.  Probably right within guidelines.  No, it's right in the middle of the 5'3".  Categories.  So how do you have a junk in the trunk?  Huh?  So how do you have some junk in the trunk?  I have a little bit.  Yeah?  Just a little bit, yeah.  Okay, so why wouldn't you be?  Okay, if you're not in panties.  Maybe she took a shotgun blast to the rear, but she doesn't want to show the mask.  It just doesn't look good?  Why wouldn't you be in your panties, Sarah? 
[02:20:30]  Because my boyfriend's coming.  Oh, yeah.  What about bikini bottom?  Yeah.  Okay.  Would you do it in bikini bottom?  Bikini bottom.  Yeah.  Hey, where's your boyfriend?  Is he there?  He's right here, yeah.  All right, let's put the boyfriend on the phone.  Okay.  Let's hear him.  Hello?  Dude, what's your problem, man?  We want to see your girlfriend naked.  We want to see her, like, kind of naked.  Naked?  Well, not like broad panties, bro.  Oh, that's straight.  Yeah, kid?  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up, yo? 
[02:21:00]  Whatever, whatever.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wait, you're white, but you're talking that black stuff.  No.  You black talking the black stuff?  No.  I'm white.  Yeah?  So whatever, whatever.  Oh, okay.  He don't sound home.  He don't sound down.  All right, let's put Sarah back in line.  Okay.  Here she is.  Hello?  Sarah, we got permission.  You got to do it in the bra and panties.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Bring some hot little ones.  Okay.  All right?  All right.  All right, we'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:21:30]  Okay.  Hold on, though.  Hold on.  All right.  There you go.  I don't want to frighten these people away, Opie.  Norton, you are just a goddamn deviant.  What?  You're degenerate.  What?  You got so worked up during that last segment.  You really did.  Ask me how much I got.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing in her T-shirt.  I will see.  I washed her the same.  I didn't get to touch with her.  Oh, you got to wash her down?  I saw her naked, but for just a T-shirt. 
[02:22:00]  No, she had jeans on.  She's absolutely...  She did not have jeans on when I walked in on you.  A hundred percent.  You're wrong.  She was wearing a pair of jeans.  No, she was not.  If she wasn't, I would have been going...  Dude, when I opened the door, she was just wearing a T-shirt.  I saw tanned legs.  There were no jeans.  I'm telling you, she was...  There were no jeans.  You're lying.  Listen, Norma Rae.  Norton, I'm hearing something else.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's get to...  This one was undone.  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:22:30]  Listen.  Oh!  Go, Norma.  Do I ever lie about sex?  We don't know.  No.  To the police?  Wait, where was...  Hold on.  Mary, where was all this going on, though?  In our bathroom.  Oh, you went in there to do...  She had...  She was absolutely dressed...  Girl, I didn't have jeans on.  Guaranteed she had jeans on.  Mary, you did not walk in on anything.  You saw me in this.  I've been in this.  But I know that I saw that your pants weren't on.  They were not... 
[02:23:00]  This is what you saw, Mary.  Let me see your pants.  Let me see if they could be mistaken.  Let me see.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I saw it.  Mary, don't you do that goofy stuff that you're about to do.  I don't get more instant feedback.  I don't...  No.  Wow.  And...  All right.  What's the second part?  Norton, was your fly indeed open for any reason?  My mule was out.  I would tell you if my mule was out.  All right.  I'll tell you off the air.  It really wasn't out.  I'm willing to believe you.  All right.  I wish.  Why?  Why?  Tell us the real story later. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  Okay.  That's how it is.  Wow.  She's a nice girl.  She's cuddling now.  She did a nice thing for the show.  You guys are canoodling.  What a great fan she is.  Yes.  11 hours on a bus.  A guy's fist in my catcher's mitt.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Chris from the slaughterhouse.  Chris.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Hey, bro.  Hey, that lamb's blood, it's going to harden up just like pig's blood.  Oh, boy.  You're not going to, it won't be able to shoot out of a gun. 
[02:24:00]  Frenchie, what about lamb's blood?  We're going to try to get it anyway.  I'll let you know tomorrow.  If we get some lamb's blood.  We can heat it up a little bit.  Now, if you heat it up, it's going to really stick together.  You can't heat it up.  No way.  So, we get some lamb's blood.  Look.  We keep it in a container.  And then, what?  Maybe mix it with some type of solvent to keep it.  You could, yeah.  I think that would work.  What can we mix lamb's blood with to keep it fluid?  I'll find out tomorrow.  Yeah.  I'll be dead.  Frenchie will find out.  Yeah.  The official French chef of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:24:30]  All right, guys.  I didn't want to ruin anything.  Oh.  The shirt comes off.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  All right.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Norton helping her change.  What a nice guy you are.  Dude, I'm all about what is nice.  What is best.  She really did.  That really bugs me.  She really did have pants on when she walked in.  I wish she didn't.  I had pants on.  I really wish she didn't.  I really did.  All right.  We're going to take a break, yeah?  All righty.  All right.  All righty.  But her zipper is undone.  Hey.  Because I didn't do it when I came out of the bathroom.  Who cares, right? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Norton, you are muscling that unit.  You are muscling.  You are.  It's like you're punishing it.  Whoa.  What'd she say?  She just like latched on and started shaking around.  I cling on to things that are, you know.  How would you say that stacks up now that your hand is on it?  How would it stack up?  Well, according to my guy, yeah, Norton's like A plus right now.  Wow.  Look at her hand.  Look at where her hand is.  She's got a chart to it.  She's got a chart to it. 
[02:25:30]  What do you think you were on, a Greyhound bus?  What are you doing?  Stop it.  That's exactly where I was.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We're going to take a big breath.  A plus.  A plus.  That's good.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Get a good one.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it barely fits through the hole.  Just squeeze it through.  Squish it through.  Squish it through.  Oh, my God.  It's another dish.  That was a whopper. 
[02:26:00]  Coming soon.  The return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show today.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Philly and Boston.  Right.  866-2774.  Wow.  More gooder.  That's 866-2774.  Wow.  Our spies are telling us that we did more gooder in the ratings in Boston and Philly. 
[02:26:30]  We don't know for sure because our company doesn't subscribe to the ratings anymore.  Yeah.  They don't really believe in the ratings thing anymore.  And at this point, I don't blame them.  They're right.  Ignorance is bliss, as they say.  The less you know, the better.  Let's go to Michelle, the crazy French girl.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello. 
[02:27:00]  Yes, who am I talking with?  Hi.  Am I on the air?  All right.  So, I would like to talk to you about, you know, sexy food.  So, I don't know.  Maybe French knows about it.  It's called, in French, it's called les oeufs.  Les oeufs moutons à la brève.  That's good stuff.  You know what that is?  Yeah, those are the balls from the...  Of the sheep.  The testicles.  The testicles cooked in the red ashes. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, yeah?  And it's so good, you know.  But for people who don't know it, you know, it sounds like, you know, freaky.  Frenchie, what's with her voice?  Do all women in France sound like her?  No, I don't think so.  She sounds like she's at the French helium factory, and she's breathing in the inventory.  I'm French.  You know, stop it.  You know, Anthony.  No, no, she said it the right way in French, actually.  Well, let me tell you something.  Anthony.  What?  Shut up.  I'm crazy about you.  I like shopping in helium and going to... 
[02:28:00]  I can't use that language.  You push me.  Don't use that language.  Hey, tell him in French.  They don't understand it.  Eh, oui, oui.  Comment est-ce que je te dis, Frenchie?  Dis-lui qu'il allait se faire foutre.  Eh, j'aime beaucoup Frenchie.  Frenchie.  Il a beaucoup d'esprit.  Hey, you said a lot of something.  Yeah, she says I have a lot of spirit.  That's what she said.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of wit.  A lot of wit. 
[02:28:30]  A lot of wit.  Look at, look at, Frenchie, as popular as Jerry Lewis with the French people.  I'm a good man.  I'm a good man myself, you know.  All right.  Well, what do you got today, crazy French girl besides that?  All right.  So, I'm telling you about the testicle on the, you know, because...  You can't get over the lamb testicle food, okay?  Because the girl that came first, you know, the 18-year-old girl, she say, I want, you  know, like, I feel sexy.  You know, and the brain is, you know, is not sexy.  So, I thought, you know, for a sexy, someone who feels sexy, she ought to eat something sexy. 
[02:29:00]  Uh-huh.  And unusual.  You know, so that's why I was thinking that.  You suggest that she eats the sheep testicles.  Sheep testicles.  It's delicious.  You know, that, you know.  Cooked over a fire, I think.  Right.  Well, for someone who never heard about it, it sounds like, you know...  Oui, oui.  Yeah.  It's delicious, you know.  And like a brochette, you know, sometimes, you know, you put them on the brochette.  They're all about cooking, these people, Opie.  They're all about the cooking. 
[02:29:30]  They're on the south of French or North Africa, you know, in Algeuse.  Of course.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Anthony, you know, I loved your barbrot.  Oh, thank you.  I was...  Merci, merci.  Merci.  All right, Michelle, Michelle, we're going to let you go, okay?  All right.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  We don't want to burn you out, man.  Bye-bye.  It's Frenchette.  It's Frenchette, yeah. 
[02:30:00]  Frenchette.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  The Naughty Nighty tomorrow, announcing the winner.  We will be announcing the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest tomorrow during the show.  Voting ends at 5 o'clock tomorrow.  Very soon after that, we'll announce the winner to everybody.  Go to opianthony.com and make sure you make your vote count, okay?  Is there a chance you won't be on the air tomorrow?  I think we'll be here, sure.  All right.  We'll be here.  We'll be here.  Hey, Norton.  Hold on, Chris, just to finish up this thought. 
[02:30:30]  We're trying to put a quick little something together that we can bring out the winner of  the Naughty Nighty contest so everyone can meet her.  Yeah, somewhere locally here in New York City.  We might just go out after the show, bring her, and have some beers with people.  Hooters or something?  Show her off.  Yeah, maybe Hooters next door.  Something very casual, but you guys could check her out, and maybe some of the other ladies  that were in the finals could show up as well.  Cool.  And we'll throw a little quick party together, okay?  Those are always fun.  We have fun.  We drink. 
[02:31:00]  We throw beers at slot machines.  It's a great time if you were at the last one.  Norton.  Yes, sir?  I saw American Dummies this weekend.  Oh, Otto and George is fine.  Isn't that great?  Great little film.  Yes, you can get that at c3films.com.  Adam Dubin directed that.  Otto is great in that, and Jim Brewer is in that.  Tony Metropolis is hilarious.  Yeah, Brewer is Tony Metropolis.  He's hysterical.  The King of Canasi.  Hack, rip-off comic.  Dude, they had to shoot behind me.  I kept, every time Brewer walked over and he was giving that speech and we're all at  the table, I'm laughing at his face. 
[02:31:30]  That's great.  I really almost ruined it.  Later, boys.  All right, Chris.  I got to see that again.  Really fun.  Yeah, it is really good.  Great.  Adam Dubin, piece of work.  Let's go to Corey.  Corey, what's up?  Hey, I was just calling in response to that whole Greyhound hand in area.  Yeah.  I was just wondering if the people over at Greyhound were thinking about changing their  slogan from, go Greyhound, leave the driving to us, to go Greyhound, leave the molesting  to us.  Leave the molesting to us.  Yeah.  Well, our guest got molested on Greyhound on her way down here. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, could you imagine that?  Just wake up with a hand in your lap like that.  Probably some dirty, you know, toothless bums type of guy.  Oh, yeah.  It's, you know.  What's next?  You hit the lottery?  Norton, you are the sickest son of a bitch I know.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Maybe I can't get away with that.  I'm sorry.  That's dedication to our radio show, though.  She's on a bus for 11 hours and a guy's molesting her.  Right.  While she's asleep.  And a testament to her and her family.  There you go.  There you go.  All right, Corey.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:32:30]  Lou, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to remind you guys, just in case, about five minutes before the show  is over, make sure to say your mom's box.  Oh, say your mom's box.  The famous last words of everybody that leaves this program, your mom's box.  Thanks, guys.  Your mom's box.  I don't know.  I think it's just going to be some kind of a, I don't know what the meeting is going  to be about.  I don't think it's a we're in trouble meeting.  I think it's a changes are in the air meeting and something like that.  It's never just a how you're doing.  No, no. 
[02:33:00]  It's not how you're doing.  Never, ever, ever.  It's like all of a sudden the president calling a general in and just saying, hey, what's up?  You know, it's going to happen.  Because you know what?  Like there's something to tell the general.  Because you know what?  I was discussing this with Ken over the weekend.  I told him if he wanted to have one of these how you're doing type situations.  Yeah.  He had a perfect opportunity when we were all at the Video Music Awards.  Right.  Exactly.  A little how you're doing.  Had that private room.  Fine.  How do you do?  With all the big shots from the company. 
[02:33:30]  Uh-huh.  I don't know.  This is a.  We were not invited, but that's okay.  Then he saw us in the hall.  And we are part of the company.  If he really cared about a how you're doing type situation, he would invite us in for  a quick drink.  We're horrid, man.  We were standing outside the real VIP section of the Video Music Awards.  We're standing outside the door just peering in like, well, could you get to someone in  there, it's like, well, we can't get in, but could you go and give a message to Tony from  BCN and tell him that we're just the low-life scum and people are walking out. 
[02:34:00]  Other radio celebrities are walking out of this VIP area with their leggy girlfriends.  And we're like, you know, we're just the scum.  Couldn't even get in there.  And it's our company.  It's our company.  We got bounced from our own company.  It's Viacom, which owns MTV, which, and like, we're Viacom employees.  We had signed a deal that I thought put us where we were at least respected enough in  the company. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  That, well, believe me, I learned real quick that ain't the case.  People are walking out.  We had to talk.  Looking at us like we're crap.  We had to talk them into allowing Ben to go into this private room with a waiter escorting  him so he didn't run off and cause havoc.  Right.  To go find Tony, who runs WBCN up there in Boston.  And then Tony came out to say hi to us.  Yeah.  And Tony wouldn't even invite us back into the party.  And I'm like, I want to see who's in there.  I want to see the vibe. 
[02:35:00]  It's like, Tony, could you get us in?  Oh, no.  No.  No, they don't want you.  It's like, why?  Oh, my God.  No.  You might not like the champagne and caviar that's going on in there.  Sushi and everything else.  No, that's cool.  Actually, I had more fun hanging out with DMX downstairs smoking pot.  And Fat Boy Slim.  And Fat Boy Slim.  If you could cut through the cloud of pot smoke by the bar.  Sub 41.  Yeah, that was fun.  And that leggy anorexic model. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Nice.  So, I was telling Ken, if it was a how-you-do type thing, there's been plenty of opportunities to have a little how-you-do.  No.  I have my...  I've been speculating as to what I think this is about.  Whether it's things that are imminent or things that are really on the horizon within a matter of no time.  That's the only thing I'm kind of teetering on.  But I think it's something.  Dennis, what's up?  I think it's something changing.  Do you think it's safe to say he really doesn't care how you're doing? 
[02:36:00]  Exactly.  No, he doesn't.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like, when some people tell me, oh, maybe it's just, you know, since Fareed isn't in charge of Infinity anymore,  maybe it's just a kind of, hey, guys, I'm, you know, in charge here.  I'm doing...  Nah.  Why would he tell us that?  No, we have a contract.  He wants us to get good ratings, so we make money for him.  Maybe he wants to know who your new friend is.  No.  Because I'm a lot and wants to just chat about him.  Oh, give me a break.  Have a little ball, guys. 
[02:36:30]  Dennis, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I'm from 976 Wake.  You guys have approximately 16 hours and 35 minutes before your meeting.  Is it down to 16 hours?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll be sleeping tonight.  Have a good day, guys.  I've got to get my thoughts in order.  You only get about five minutes.  Oh, there ain't no thoughts.  You go in there and you take it like a man.  Yeah.  And you walk out and hope for the best.  I don't know why the ratings are dropping.  So you think changes are imminent?  No, I don't know if it's imminent or it's going to be one of those, here's what we're working on. 
[02:37:00]  Here's what we're thinking.  Here's what we're working on.  Of course, we're talking about the New York situation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's no secret.  We're at a radio station that is all underperforming.  Yeah.  Has underperformed ever since we got to New York.  Uh-huh.  Matter of fact, the station had better ratings when it, and I first stepped foot into this  place almost four years ago.  We did.  At the time, they were not happy with the, I think it was like a 1.7. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Four years later, it's now down to a 1.2, and we got stations beating us all over the radio  landscape.  A lot of stations that don't even speak English.  Uh-huh.  Don't even speak English, Ant.  You know what?  Wow, this is interesting.  A black girl from the future actually came back with audio of tomorrow's meeting.  He brought it back, and I guess this is me.  Hmm.  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  Wow. 
[02:38:00]  What happened?  What happened?  I got nothing else.  Oh, man.  That doesn't sound good.  I thought maybe it was going to be a good meeting, and...  Yeah, well, I...  And here's Opie?  Well...  Don't you do it!  Don't!  Wow, you sound like me.  Well, I get the boss, so...  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  As he addresses us tomorrow at 11.  You get nothing! 
[02:38:30]  You lose!  Good day, sir!  Oh, and then you had to ask him about, well, how does this affect our show?  It's not about you, douchebag!  My bad.  Yeah, you're bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow, this is...  Earl, is this true?  This is right when, uh...  Right when he walked in the office?  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  And some advice for our show from the boss.  That's, uh, not on the, uh...  That would have been good, Rick.  Oh, well.  Okay.  It's not working.  It's, uh...  I guess no advice.  Oh, jeez!  I don't want to get the H, fellas!  Today I learned underperforming means sucks.  That's what Kevin from the Bronx learned.  Mary, what's up?  I was wondering if you guys are still going to do the 6 o'clock queef with your, uh, meetings and all complex stuff. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, you mean, like, today?  Yeah.  You mean with you?  Maybe.  Are you in your car?  I am.  I have to wait until I can pull over.  Well, are you, let's just say, ready to do it if you pulled over?  Kind of.  I've been holding it for a while since, you know, you guys have kept me on the phone.  Oh.  All right, pull over while we play the theme song.  Okay, cool.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart.  It's six o'clock, it's time for a queef. 
[02:40:00]  Blow out the candles, make a wish, it's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor.  Dance up and let yourself roar, queef.  Mary, where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Philly.  Philly, and you pulled over?  I'm waiting, I'm at a light, and I want to pull over at the gas station here.  All right, oh, the gas station, that's kind of a wacky coincidence.  Yeah, oh, you know, can I ask you something? 
[02:40:30]  Sure.  Because Ant and I have spent a lot of time in Philly, we bring our show down there quite often.  Oh, yeah, you guys are Brock.  What gas station would that be?  That would be, I'm trying to see, I can't, it would be a mobile.  Mobile on the corner of, oh, yeah, I know where that is.  What street are you on right now?  Well, actually, I'm outside of Philly, it's just easier to say that I'm calling from Philly.  Right.  North of the city? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I know that mobile station on, oh, Ant, help me out.  I'm trying to remember, I know.  I'm calling over now.  It's not far from the shopping center.  Yeah, Mary, what road is that on there?  It's 309.  Yeah, 309 in what town?  It's in Montgomeryville.  But that's where you are right now?  Yeah, and I am right next to Adult World, the video superstore.  Oh, I know exactly where you are.  Yeah, booth number three, say hi to Marty.  All right, so it's 309, and what's the cross street?  Route 202. 
[02:41:30]  202 is over.  Oh, right on the corner of 309 and 202, right?  Oh, did she say that?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Adult World, and it's the mobile right around there, right?  Yep.  All right, you're pulling over right now?  I am.  I have you guys on my headset, but I'm going to unplug the headset here.  All right, well, hold on.  Why don't we just give it a couple minutes?  We usually like to rush through this segment.  Why don't we savor it today?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Savor it.  Corner 309 and 202.  Because, you know, it might be your last, the way these jerk off your ass. 
[02:42:00]  Well, yeah.  It's 309 and 202, Adult World and the mobile, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know where that is.  I wonder if anyone else knows where that is.  I wonder if they would.  I broke down outside that mobile.  What, the Adult World and 202, right?  Yeah.  The 309 and 202 intersection is the Adult World place.  Yeah.  I pulled into that mobile gas station and broke down one time.  Yeah.  How convenient, right next to the Adult World.  Yeah, I know.  I wonder if people would beep if they knew where it was. 
[02:42:30]  All right.  Well, why don't we play the theme song again here?  Yeah, you might as well do that.  All right, hold on a second there, Mary.  Get ready, okay?  I am.  I got to, guys, got to hurry up.  Why do we have to hurry?  Because I might, you know, premature.  Right.  All right, hold on.  And what kind of car are you in?  You're like, because it must be hard to do it in, like, an SUV.  I'm not giving you guys where I'm at, because, you know, people are going to come up to the  window and...  Oh, damn, Opie.  I never realized that.  Oh, no.  You guys are so smart.  What?  What happened? 
[02:43:00]  Huh?  What happened?  Nothing.  So you're not a 309 and 202?  No, I am a 309 and 202.  Oh, but you just don't want to tell us what car you're in?  No.  Oh, all right, because that would give away your location, right?  At the mobile station.  Well, I mean, if they see somebody pulled over and talking on a cell phone...  Yeah, at the mobile station.  At the mobile station.  Well, if anybody's around, beep your horn.  Obviously, no one's...  All right, so, Mary?  Yeah.  Should we play the song again, Anthony, or should we just have her do it?  Yeah, we'll just have her do it.  Okay.  I think it's good. 
[02:43:30]  All right, hold on.  I'm going to unplug you, guys.  Hold on.  All right, here goes Mary.  Are you still there?  Yeah.  And the 634 queef.  All right.  Okay, ready?  Shh, shh, shh.  All right.  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  This is kind of...  This is more difficult than I expected.  Okay.  Be quiet.  Everyone, quiet.  Quiet.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  All right.  Did you guys hear that?  Vinyl seats.  Oh, yeah.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart. 
[02:44:00]  At 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles, make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  At 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  Thank you, Mary.  You guys rock, man.  Oh, you rock.  All right.  Norton, hopefully see you when you come to Philly.  Thank you, Mary.  Mary, no cars around, huh?  There's a guy in a truck right next to me. 
[02:44:30]  If he's listening, beep your horn.  Well, there's a delay, though.  Oh, the delay would take hours.  Yeah.  Maybe weeks.  Why?  Does he look a little suspicious?  He actually, a lot of people park in this parking lot and then go over to Adult World,  you know, trying to be all secretive-like.  Hey, isn't that the place where there's the Burger King across the street?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know where that is.  Yeah, usually you go into the booth for a little while, you go across the street for  some burgers.  Grab a Burger King.  Hey, if you're up for that.  Get a sauce.  I think you're right near the Montgomeryville Mall. 
[02:45:00]  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  And people are beeping their horns.  Montgomeryville loves you guys.  Oh, really?  Yep.  That's so nice.  How many cars are in the area now?  There's a lot.  It's a pretty big.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Hey, say hi to Steve over at Burger King.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right?  Why don't you wave to him because he's looking at you from Burger King.  Is he now?  Yeah.  Nice.  Wave at him. 
[02:45:30]  All right, you better take off because a sexual assault is just moments away, I'm sure.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  You rock, man.  There she goes, Mary.  Wow.  All right, we'll play what we learned next.  Did we learn anything today?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Next.  What did you learn today?  On the O.P. and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  Hey, it's time to play.  What did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show? 
[02:46:00]  Kimmy from Survivor 9 or 10 has to leave, I guess.  I want to say goodbye in this bed.  What?  You want to say goodbye, you said?  Yeah, because I don't know if you guys are ever going to be back.  Oh, we're back.  Faces.  We're not even going to start back.  Faces.  Go kick ass tomorrow.  We're not going to start those crazy rumors.  We'll be back.  Hey, well, we might get fired.  But I'm going to come back on a Wednesday with some girlfriends.  Oh, yeah, do that.  We'll wow you up.  Next time you're here, you've got to talk about how you love to have sex in public. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  She loves that, Aunt.  That's one of her things.  Celebrities.  It doesn't have to be celebrities.  No?  She's planning on having sex at the Billy Joel concert.  Yes, I am.  Wow, you're wild.  Ooh.  During Piano Man.  Ert, ert, ert.  That's a wild show to be at.  I think it's wilder to do it at a Billy Joel show because the audience isn't really expecting it.  Yeah, that's true.  You go to like a Nine Inch Nails show or something like that.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, that's true.  I'd have more respect if you did it at Bruce Springsteen when he was singing Philadelphia. 
[02:47:00]  Very funny, very funny.  Well, let's play What Do We Learn?  All right, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that even after not being on the show for six months, Kimmy's still an annoying  dumb twat bitch.  Oh, wow.  Oh, come on.  All right, guys, I'm going to go see if my mom wants me to munch on her carpet.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Derek, what's up?  We always had fun.  Hey, how you doing?  All right, Derek.  Hey, I learned that logs live in the mud bog.  Right.  All right, I got to go make some canary yellow.  See you later. 
[02:47:30]  I love you guys.  Bobby Big Rigger.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I learned that another queef always ended.  Did you hear that?  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  And I was wondering, LLC from Cleveland, is she happy with her big cans?  Yeah.  Yes, Dr. Smith.  Later, guys.  Very good.  Yeah, she's very happy with them.  Mellon, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I learned that Anthony had the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel all to himself today.  That was very little traffic in there.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, what did you learn today?  Hey, today I learned if you're rich enough, a murder is a misdemeanor charge of shenanigans. 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  Oh, shenanigans.  Yes.  Check it out.  I guess we did something today, huh?  Yeah.  I swear to God, I'll pistol whip the next guy that says shenanigans.  Ah, Sully, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, man.  Hey.  I learned after tomorrow you two guys are going to be paying for your own airtime.  Waddledoodle.  Waddledoodle.  Bone dry, grease man show.  Paying his own bills.  Yeah.  Got to buy my own airtime and then sell commercials.  I go out on sales calls, Waddledoodle.  My new sponsor, Greyhound Bus. 
[02:48:30]  Put a hand in your lap, eh?  Rob, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Today I learned that Craig the Dump Button guy rode a bus from Cleveland to work.  Him and his quick little finger.  What do you mean?  And I knew Craig has a quick finger because if he did, I said, wow.  Oh, that's pretty quick.  Wow, Rob.  Very good.  Just told the Dump guy to go F himself. 
[02:49:00]  He goes, you know how I know he has a quick finger because he, but how do you, oh, whatever.  I'll never hear him.  He'll never hear me.  He'll have to catch me going.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was good.  Ah, you should have been there.  Yeah, exactly.  Jameek from Brooklyn.  I learned today Greyhound is changing its name to Muff Hound.  Sheep Lover, I learned today, four phones smashed and counting.  Adam from Valley Stream.  Today I learned if a girl wakes up on a bus and finds a man's hand in her lap, it's rape.  But if a guy wakes up with a girl's hand in his lap, it's going to be a damn good trip.  Steven from Lindenhurst. 
[02:49:30]  Today I learned that Jim Norton prefers inaudible Aussie bootlegs to perfectly clear CDs.  Sheep Lover again.  I learned today Adam from Valley Stream is a stupid, stupid man.  Yes.  He also learned make the camera for bootlegs look like a dude.  That's right.  We learned that.  Let's see.  Kevin from Cleveland.  The meeting tomorrow will be to announce the Jim Brewer show with Stephen Baldwin as his sidekick.  On that note, Bleacher Anthony says, today I learned Ben will be the new out-to-lunch DJ starting tomorrow. 
[02:50:00]  Mike from the Bronx.  I learned ratings are overrated.  Yes.  Bleacher Anthony.  I learned that a yellow lake and a mud pit makes a great picture.  Baxter from Long Island.  I learned that Kimmy from Survivor 7 can't queef unless she's getting nailed.  Right.  We did learn that.  Yes, we did.  Dip Spit Eric from Jersey.  I learned today that Anthony used to ride the old Cleveland steamer down the river.  Hey, who didn't?  Mike from Jersey. 
[02:50:30]  Today at the start of the O&A show, I learned that the Cleveland steamer was also a train used by Huck Finn and Jason Williams arrested on one count of hijinks and one count of tomfoolery.  Tomfoolery.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, what did you learn on the show today?  Management must die.  That's our new motto.  Later, faggots.  Later.  Let's go to Caroline, Brian.  Caroline.  Hey, how are you?  Hey.  I learned that Stalker Patty has a new nickname. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  It's Patso Rizzo.  Patso Rizzo.  And I need Anthony to do the I'm walking here thing in Patty's voice because I can't do the impression.  Oh.  Hey, I'm walking over here.  Very good.  Thank you.  All right.  Eddie O wants to say something.  Eddie O.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What did you learn?  I learned today that your ratings parties in New York were more premature than the millionaire parties held by all those stockbrokers who invested in tech stocks.  Right. 
[02:51:30]  A good strong back, Eddie.  We're going to work you.  Hey, guys.  I also learned that a manager at WNEW should change their name to Schillinger for the amount of times they raped you.  Oh, wow.  Get the axle, Grace.  All right, Eddie.  Let's go to Jamie.  Jamie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that my name's dumb button, guys.  He's actually a priest with a mule in his mouth.  You did learn that.  Andy, what did you learn today?  Hey, O&A, I learned that if the lawyers approve of your show, nobody would want to listen to it. 
[02:52:00]  Exactly.  Hey, good luck tomorrow, guys.  All right.  We'll speak our minds tomorrow.  We'll see what happens.  Dan, what's up?  Speak to us.  I learned today that Patty's feet got screwed before she did.  You guys are on.  Oh, very good.  All right.  I think we're just about done, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah.  Do we want to say goodbye to Double LC or whatever her name is from Cleveland?  What a trooper she is.  She qualified for the 55-gallon jump challenge, Anthony.  Yes.  So she'll be back when we do that. 
[02:52:30]  We got nailed down a date.  Hopefully, like, a week from Friday would be good.  And we still got to get four more girls to qualify, I guess.  One girl's coming in Wednesday, and we're going to take super soakers filled with lamb blood and square ash.  And shoot her with it.  As she's naked or down to her brown panties.  How cool will that look when the lamb blood just hits her body and starts dripping down?  Yeah.  And another girl jumping on a Greyhound bus tonight, possibly from Cleveland.  No, I think a friend is driving her, or a boyfriend.  So she won't have the hand to worry about in her lap. 
[02:53:00]  And she's going to eat lamb brains right from the skull.  In her bra and panties.  In her bra and panties with a spoon as she scoops it out.  Eighteen.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Where's the old log production?  What, the hot dog girl?  The one who was going to make something and then put her face in it.  Teach yourself a lesson.  Oh, right, right.  I know the girl that blew us off.  Yeah.  Ah, damn it.  Too bad, too.  Hot dog girl, I'm assuming, at this point blew us off.  Yeah, she had a friend who was going to put a hot dog there and then munch, munch, munch.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  We got some fine tickets for, well, pretty much anyone, if you could get yourself to New York.  New York, how's that sound?  Okay.  Good.  We got five pairs of tickets to, oh, cool, the Snowcore Rock Tour featuring Alien Ant Farm,  Edema, Clashjaw, and Earshot at Roseland on Saturday, March 2nd.  A few tickets are still available through Ticketmaster Outlets and the Irving Plaza Box Office.  So, if you want to go see those fine bands, give us a call right now.  We'll give them to some random callers, okay? 
[02:54:00]  Okay.  And some guy on the EverQuest server last night said he bet his friend 30 bucks that he actually does help me out on the game.  And so he gets 30 bucks.  Al Zia, he does help me out.  Now, that's a bet, Opie.  You've got to give the guy 30 bucks.  And Ziedrich from Jersey learned, you can't listen to Stubble on the radio, but you can curse in French.  When in New York City, stay at the Park Central New York, 7th Avenue, near Broadway Theatres and Central Park.  1-800-346-1359.  The Opie and Anthony Show. </pre>
