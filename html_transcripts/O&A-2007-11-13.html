<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show covered a wide range of topics, showcasing their characteristically irreverent and often offensive style.  The broadcast began with discussions about their ongoing battles with CBS over broadcasting regulations, specifically concerning technical difficulties with their instant feedback system. This led to a segment called "Rock Scream Tuesday," where callers attempted (and often failed) to imitate rock vocal screams, met with the hosts’ characteristically blunt critiques.  A "Far Away Phone Call Tuesday" segment featured a caller from Fargo, North Dakota.  The hosts further vented their frustrations about seemingly arbitrary censorship, citing examples of other shows using words they were forbidden from uttering. They announced an upcoming trivia contest, the promotion of which had become a source of contention with their legal team due to restrictions on the use of a specific word (the "F word"), even influencing the contest's name.  The planned trivia contest, which involved contestants making a specific bodily noise to answer, was presented as a direct and humorous challenge to these restrictions.

The show then moved on to a discussion about a news story on "taser parties," prompting a humorous, graphic, and detailed imagining of such an event, involving women in lingerie, tasers, and a playful atmosphere of controlled mayhem.  This segment included a digression into Opie's hitchhiking anecdote involving goth kids and a creepy ride.  A "Makeup Stuff Tuesday" segment involved the hosts falsely reporting the cancellation of several popular TV shows due to the writer's strike, along with a false claim about the sun burning out in 200 years.

The discussion of the taser party continued, with callers suggesting variations and a taser instructor calling in to discuss legality and safety.  Other briefly discussed topics included Kanye West's mother's death, online dating statistics and first-date sex, the Pope's upcoming US visit, the writers' strike (and the use of inflatable protest rats by unions), and a report suggesting the sun's shorter lifespan. A caller correctly identified a transgender actress on Good Morning America.  The hosts continued to grapple with the absurdities of their legal restrictions surrounding the trivia contest's name, engaging in humorous bickering about the situation.

The show continued with a discussion of potential NBC show cancellations, rumored to be linked to conflicts between the network and stars/writers of *30 Rock*, *The Office*, and *My Name Is Earl*.  A call from "Chris the Trucker" about the sun's lifespan led to a humorous, albeit absurd, discussion of its potential extinction and the consequences for Earth.  This segued into a Drudge Report story about new research suggesting the sun's lifespan is much shorter than previously believed.  Other news items included a supposedly edited CNN interview with John Cena about steroid use, highlighting perceived network bias, and a story about a 65-year-old woman strip-searched at a casino after sneezing and accidentally dropping coins into her pantyhose.  The segment concluded with listener calls, discussions of upcoming comedy appearances, and a lengthy discussion about the show's run-ins with their network over the use of words like "faggot," "douchebag," and "negro," contrasting their situation with *South Park*.  The hosts contemplated a symbolic strike in protest and expressed their desire to continue creating edgy content.  A call from Chris Jericho, a previous guest, addressed a past controversial interaction with one of the hosts, clarifying misunderstandings and offering apologies.

A substantial portion of the show featured a lengthy conversation with Chris Jericho, covering his WWE return, his successful book tour, his views on manipulative media reporting (using the John Cena/CNN incident as an example),  and his experiences with steroid questions.  The discussion included jokes about their penis sizes and Jericho's near-assault of Jimmy Norton.  The hosts and Jericho also graphically described and viewed a video depicting extreme, explicit sexual acts involving feces ("Brazilian scat"), reacting with shock, disgust, and humor.  The segment included further discussion of TMZ's reporting on the John Cena/CNN incident, a new "Ramon" promo by Steve Wilkos,  the Hollywood writers’ strike, the potential for the sun to burn out sooner than expected, and various listener calls.

The final excerpt centered around recurring themes and anecdotes. A significant portion focused on a recurring "ow" sound made by a coworker, Steve, often while on the phone.  The hosts discussed their attempts to elicit this sound.  They also discussed a humorous news story about a man nursed back to health by his girlfriend, leading to graphic descriptions and offensive jokes about his appearance and possible infidelity.  A caller, Brian from Poughkeepsie, called in about hockey tickets.  A significant part of the show was dedicated to "Line of the day" segments, sponsored by Bodogfantasy.net, featuring offensive jokes submitted by listeners, which were met with humorous commentary and banter between the hosts.  The show concluded with a song mocking the FCC.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony striking again.  I sat with some of the greatest gangsters in the world, John Gotti, Zam Gravano.  And I went in and said, John, you ever f***ed with me again, this is Opie.  You hear? Now sit down!  Opie and Anthony.  I was amazed Guns N' Roses was starting to blow up, and you didn't have guitars to play because you were pointing them off to get some dope. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, I was a big fan of the age, but I'm a big fan.  Opie and Anthony.  This country went off the cliff, and it's just in free fall news.  It's just a sick, it's disgusting, my voice, you hear me.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Just letting the music establish. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Let it establish.  And there we go.  Go.  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  How's everybody today?  Good.  I wasn't talking to you, I asked you that already. 
[00:02:00]  Dammit.  And I knew the answer.  I knew it.  I'm talking to the imaginary people.  You mean the audience.  I get it now.  I don't know how they are.  This is the stupidest thing ever.  Hi, we're gonna talk to you now.  We're talking through this.  Yeah.  Hello.  And we just gotta assume that somebody's listening.  That it's coming out the other end somewhere.  And there's a pair of ears.  That's ridiculous.  What a silly job. 
[00:02:30]  The company could just pull a switch down the hall, and we could do a whole show assuming  someone's listening to us.  And they're not.  And there won't be a soul listening.  No.  So.  But we'd put just as much gusto into it.  We sure do.  All right.  A few things.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Also, don't forget ONARadio.com.  Don't forget PalTalk.  For all those people that want a little extra from their radio show.  A little extra.  We got cameras all over the studio. 
[00:03:00]  And you can watch us through the radio show.  Watch this mess.  Also, like CBS, they put up their own PalTalk camera, I guess.  Yeah, they did.  And we put a hat over the camera.  Yeah.  And they're not happy about that.  Well, that's for the rest of the day.  When here in New York, the music is playing.  And then you can look at the music jocks as they spin their hot wax.  As they said back in the old day.  So the guy that was running that camera was a little too aggressive. 
[00:03:30]  Getting extreme close-ups of our swollen faces in the morning.  He certainly was.  All of a sudden, I go in for a pic, and I look to my left, and it's on extreme close-up.  It's just like, dude.  People are screen capping.  Right, a little too motivated, so we threw a hat over that camera.  We're like, you can't be trusted.  Yeah, he runs it from some remote location somewhere.  Yeah.  And he just sits there, and he was wandering around the room.  And you could just see the camera going, and then it zooms in. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Like, hey, hey, hey, I didn't call for that.  Back off.  And it is creepy to hear the lenses just...  Yeah.  Unless you want to put a camera in your house that we can control.  Right.  We don't want one that you control.  And then, of course, we got the instant feedback, which is huge for the Opie and Anthony show.  I think you could get it on onaradio.com.  Yeah.  Or maybe not, because I think their instant feedback is a different link that we only check 
[00:04:30]  once or twice a show.  Is there still an Apple widget for it?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, we wanted that updated, so it's the one we check in the studio.  I don't know if that ever happened.  I really don't.  I really don't know.  Maybe one of the 20 people that work for us behind the scenes could find out for us.  That'd be nice.  Because we promote it, and then some of these people are instant feedbacking through the  K-Rock website here in New York.  We don't check that.  No.  We check it every once in a while.  It's the other one that's on all the other websites. 
[00:05:00]  It's right in front of us, updating every second.  Right.  With great material for the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Paul in New Jersey.  Paul, what's up?  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, how's it going?  Oh, is he just a nervous Nelly?  This is why.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hi, Paul.  This is why, as a radio show, we kind of back out of the driveway slow.  We get our bearings.  We adjust all the mirrors.  We figure out what station we want on.  Right. 
[00:05:30]  Adjust the seats.  Get all set.  Put our coffee in the coffee holder.  And then we slowly start the radio show.  Very slowly.  Because we know a lot of people set their alarms right at six o'clock, and they don't even  know what they're doing.  He's calling the show Paul.  Hey, Paul.  And his name is Paul.  Wait, I'm Paul.  I've never been that nervous, though.  Hold on.  Hold on, Paul.  I called other people me.  A whole group.  Yeah.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hello.  Me.  Oh, sorry.  I'm just tired.  Okay, stupid. 
[00:06:00]  Just woke up Paul.  Is it just woke up Paul or nervous Paul?  No, I'm just woke up Paul, and I want to let you boys know that I am listening.  All right.  We'd like to hear that, sir.  All right.  They're Paul's listening.  CBS won't do what there, E-Rock?  What's that communique?  The instant feedback link on onaradio.com.  Why?  Because they don't control that instant feedback, so it will not come up on their site.  All right.  They really got to stop making it so hard to broadcast a radio show. 
[00:06:30]  They really have got to stop.  I'm not sure what you mean they don't control it.  Like, we don't control the other one, do we?  It's just kind of whatever.  Yeah, I thought it was just kind of.  It's a separate server that we use, that we've always used, but because they don't own or run it,  it won't go up on that site, because they don't have any control over it.  So how do we check that feedback?  Yeah.  Through the old link.  They just make it impossible.  Through the old link?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  They just make it impossible to broadcast.  They still get to it.  They really do.  It's ridiculous.  That is kind of tough to get feedback. 
[00:07:00]  Believe it, we'd love to control it.  There's a few of them I'd love to have changed.  Yeah, well.  All right, well, there's today's little problem.  Every day it's a little problem.  A little problem here and there.  All right, let's not forget it's Rock Scream Tuesday.  We haven't done one of these in a while.  You want to get one of these out of the way yet?  Well, that's a wake-er-upper.  All right, we got Tommy in New Mexico.  Tommy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hi.  I got a little Rock Scream for you.  All right.  Yeah, I know.  That's why we went to you. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  All right, Tommy, let's hear your Rock Scream.  Let her rip.  That was really him?  Sounded like a laser beam or something from a science fiction movie.  Who do you base your Rock Scream on?  A lot of times when people do Rock Screams, you go, oh, that sounds like Ronald Plante or  Steven Tyler, whoever.  Sounded like Faye Ray.  Yeah.  Who was that based on? 
[00:08:00]  I don't know.  Just some of those terrible old 80s bands.  Well, not.  How about you name one?  Because that wasn't.  I don't remember one that terrible.  That wasn't an 80s Rock Scream.  Is that Dave Coverdale?  Huh?  How about Cinderella?  Oh, okay.  Terrible.  No, Cinderella was okay, actually.  No.  Heartbreak Station.  Listen to that album.  It's fine.  It's a fine piece of work.  All right, Tommy.  Thank you for your Rock Scream, I think. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you.  guitar solo 
[00:09:00]  It's Rock Scream Tuesday  There you go, we got that out of the way  Thank you, it is Rock Scream Tuesday  Officially, so  People are saying he's from New Mexico  Was he New Mexico or Arizona?  Same difference, but  So it sounded like an Apache war cry  Perhaps he was  American Indian  Well now we got Bill in Levittown, it'll be a little different from Levittown 
[00:09:30]  Long Island Rock Scream  I know what this is going to sound like  Is this going to sound like Twisted Sister, what do we got?  Zebra  Tell me what you want  Who are you styling your Rock Scream after?  Tell me what you want  Are you ready boys?  Who are you styling it after, sir?  Jeff Tate  From Queensryche  Oh, Queensryche, okay  See, I didn't want to acknowledge that because I don't really like Queensryche  It's one of those bands you either get or don't get  I never got Queensryche  They were like the poor man's Pink Floyd 
[00:10:00]  The first couple albums were alright  Then after they got a little weird  They seem like nice guys  They've been trying to get on our show for years  I just, I don't get the Queensryche  No  Silent lucidity  I played that back in the day though  Alright, Phil, let's go  Alrighty  I think we got a professional on the line 
[00:10:30]  That's not bad  Great transition  That's not bad for 610 in the morning  Between the full voice and the falsetto  I had to make up for the first guy  It wasn't no Rock Scream  Very good there, Bill  Thank you, boys  You made Long Island proud  Thank you  Of course  Why wouldn't he have one of those screens?  Let's go to Jesse in Brooklyn  Jesse  What's up, guys?  Hey  I'm actually in a metal band  So I'm going to do my metal rock screen for you  Alright, but who are you basing it on? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, who?  I'm basing it on me  Alright  Just you?  Defensive prick  You had no influences growing up?  Of course, of course  There's some influences  Some more modern stuff  Like the guys from Tool  Hatebreed  Deftones  Nice  Alright  What's the name of your band, Jesse?  It's Key  K-E-Y  K-E-Y?  That's right  Alright, your band would have been mad at you, man  You get on the Opie and Anthony show  You don't give the band a plug  Plug them  That's not smart  I drug my 
[00:11:30]  It's me  Alright, it's me  Well, where can we see me?  I mean  This guy's like one of those  K-Rocks dot com  MySpace dot com  Slash K-Rocks  You better not give out a website on our show  That could be very dangerous  He's one of those  We got corporate people listening  That could be a dangerous thing  A bastard singer  Thinks he's the whole band  Alright, Jesse  Let's hear your rock scream  You guys ready?  Yeah  That wasn't quite 
[00:12:00]  That's not a rock scream  What did you say?  What did you say in there?  The Rock Scream Tuesday  Oh, okay  That is  Not a rock scream  Huh?  I'm the singer of my band  I do that all the time  People like it  Alright, I get it  I get the sound  Hey, relax  Chill out  This guy's a little too cocky for his own good  He's also very defensive  Yes  I get it, but it's like  I'm not  We understand the sound  But it's not a rock scream  No  It's two  You want the more higher register scream? 
[00:12:30]  Of course  That's what Rock Scream Tuesday's about  It's not about a metal scream  Or a thrash scream  You guys want the 80s  You guys want the 80s rock scream  Of course  We don't really want the 80s rock scream  But we want a little more than what you gave us  You just shouted out the phrase  Alright, let me see what I got for you on this one  Alright, go ahead  Alright, there you go 
[00:13:00]  Alright  I can respect that  That had a nice grit to it  Very high  Alright, good luck to Key  And thank you Jesse from Brooklyn  Alright  Rock on, I love you guys  Rock on indeed  Yes  And don't forget  It's also this today  It's Hummer Tuesday  On the Opie and Anthony Show  Yeah  There you go  That's what it is  That's a nice promo for it  And that's all we can do  I love it 
[00:13:30]  As far as that goes  Because, you know, that's dangerous too  Radio's a very dangerous place these days  It certainly is  I don't know why, but it is  Also, it's 80s New Wave Tuesday  It's also Far Away Phone Call Tuesday  Although we had a call from New Mexico  That's pretty good  Yeah, as far as being far away from us  That's good  I like out of the country though  When it comes to that  Yeah  Yeah, I like out of the country calls  It's gonna be from Australia, New Zealand 
[00:14:00]  And those things  Because people live in New Mexico  And they hear us  You want out of the country  And it has to be like water in between  Yeah, yeah, lots of  Not like Canada  Canada  Sorry, Canada  Unless you go way up  How come we don't get calls from Mexico?  Because they're too busy  Running and digging  Yeah  Swimming  Swimming  And climbing  And avoiding  They're very active peoples 
[00:14:30]  Getting thinner  So they can fit more  Into a delivery truck  I don't know  Yeah, yeah  They're very busy people  Encasing someone in a dashboard  Right  That's  That's gotta be my favorite  What?  When you see the picture  You ever see that?  They actually disassemble  The dashboard of a car  Okay  They will lay someone in there  That is beautiful  And like gut it  And put the dashboard back  So the person's laying in the dashboard  So no matter what is searched  You can't see 
[00:15:00]  Any person  Unless they rip apart the dash  But they had this one picture  I remember seeing from a customs agent  Where they had taken the glove compartment  Opened it up  And removed the actual cardboard insert  You know  For the compartment  And you just saw this  Poor Mexican woman's horrified face  Looking out  And she's just in the dashboard of a car  How would she pay for that?  I don't know  That seems like a pretty expensive trip  That one seems like it's gonna cost you 
[00:15:30]  Because it's pretty  I think that's a pretty good one  You might not get caught  Yeah if you come in  That would kill me  Oh I know  That's what I was thinking too  Like wow  That is  I don't like being in cars  That I can't get out of  Quickly  Just in case of an accident  Like when they put you in the back  Of a hatchback  Like an old Pinto or something  And you're just in the back  Going  Alright  You just gotta write yourself off  If there's even a fender bender  I'm just dead  Did I tell you my  Hitchhiking story  From Cape Cod?  Oh you didn't hitchhike?  Did I tell you this one? 
[00:16:00]  How old were you?  Last summer  Why are you hitchhiking?  With the goth kids  That picked us up?  In the van with the chains?  No  Oh wow man  This was a great one  So  I hitchhike  It's just dangerous  So Lindsay and I  We were taking holiday  Holiday  Holiday on Cape Cod  We were on holiday  And we decided  I forgot exactly  Where we were going  I forgot  But we were going  Further out on Cape Cod 
[00:16:30]  And to one of the beaches  And like a beach bar  I forgot exactly  Where we were going  But anyway  I'm in my car  And I'm like  No I remember this  From back in my day  Going to Cape Cod  You can't hitchhike  I'm like  We have plenty of gas  Oh you had to hitchhike  And we were on  That route 6  I believe it's called  That goes all the way out  And I'm like  Nah don't worry  We have plenty of gas  And all of a sudden  I saw the exit  Say like the next exit  Is 10 miles  And I'm already on dry  I'm like  Oh crap 
[00:17:00]  We are so screwed  Because you can't just  Pull off at this point  You have to get to the exit  Right  Sure enough  About 3 or 4 miles  From the exit  Out of gas  So I leave the car  On the side of the road  And I just start  Like hitchhiking  With Lindsay  And all of a sudden  This awful van pulls up  Awful van  And the guy is like  Just out of his mind  In the passenger seat  He rolls down his window  He's like  You need a ride  Could you help me  With this couch  I'm like  Yeah I gotta go  Get some gas  He's like  Alright hop in  And I go  Alright  He goes  Oh wait a minute  And the driver 
[00:17:30]  Gets out of the car  And undoes the back doors  That were  It was chained up  Really really  Big chains right  Has the key  Opens up the back doors  And there's like  6 or 7 goth kids  In there  Oh it's a 4th of July weekend  So they're going  To some beach  To check out fireworks  And they're gone  And they're all  Tatted up and stuff  There's no seats  In the van whatsoever  And all of a sudden  I'm like  Alright let's get in  What are you  Were you crazy 
[00:18:00]  They seemed harmless  Turned out one of them  Owned a record store  In Boston  I'm like alright  I can handle this  And we jump in the back  And the guy  Chains us in  Speaking of being  Claustrophobic  If that van crashed  We were screwed  Why were you chained in  I guess the doors  Didn't work  I guess they were busted  So that was the way  To keep the doors  From flying open  While they were driving  Oh that's good  So we get back in  We get in  I mean  And we sit on the floor  With everybody else  With no seats in there  We're below window level  So you can't even see  You know  Where we're going 
[00:18:30]  And he chains up  The back doors  And locks them  With a big lock  And then we take off  And I swear to you  I estimate we were going  Between 90 and 100 miles  An hour to the exit  I was scared  Out of my freaking mind  I'm not going to sit here  And make believe  I wasn't scared  You're a crazy person  Right about at that point  I'm like man  I guess this wasn't  A really good idea  No  But in the end  It kind of worked out  So no real  Ending to the story  There's no  There's no way  You would ever hitchhike 
[00:19:00]  First of all  That I would ever hitchhike  I've never done it  I just  It was one of those things  That were just ingrained  Into me  To be afraid of  You gotta bring weapons  Nah it doesn't matter  I was told as a kid  Like horrible things  Would happen  So I just never hitchhiked  I was a good boy  I had a creepy guy  Tell me not to hitchhike  I didn't hitchhike  I had a creepy guy  Pick me up  Hitchhiking to Buffalo  To take a flight home  When I was going to school  At Geneseo  Why?

[00:26:30]  At 7 o'clock  Or sometime after 7  Between 7 and 7.30  Oh yeah the sound  We are to play  The sound of the day  Which is this one  And when you hear this  A negro  Sometime between 7 and 7.30  If you're the 10th caller  At 877-212-ONDA  You're gonna win a thousand dollars  Also it's uh  Makeup Stuff Tuesday  It is Makeup Stuff Tuesday  Now  I got a good one  And we'll talk about it after the break 
[00:27:00]  And we'll explain  Makeup Stuff Tuesday next  Okay  Is it gonna be trouble  Nah I don't think so  Alright  I think we learned from last week  A little bit  All I care about right now  Yeah it's uh  No trouble  It's Opie and Anthony  Ah you're checking out  The Opie and Anthony show  Good morning to everybody  And I mean everybody  Alright we were just talking to Kenny  Off the air  Let's just say this  There's something we're not really 
[00:27:30]  Supposed to say on the air  So Kenny goes  Can't you just spell it  Spell it  Yeah that's it  If the lawyers are five year olds  That were trying not to  Give ice cream  So we just want to spell it  Yes  But we've got an awful  Improv on my part  It's using old uh  Like cartoon strategies  Yeah  You know he doesn't like going to  S-C-H-O-O-L  Perfect example for Kenny  Dalt  Dalt  Just playing it safe on the radio  Just sucks  And it's getting out of control 
[00:28:00]  I was telling these guys off air  I was telling these guys off air that uh  We're not allowed to say douche  And then the other word that comes with it  We're allowed to say douche  Yeah  Right  And now when I see it on TV  It drives me nuts  Because I'm like oh my god  That's the word we can't say on the radio  But it's being set on TV  And not just on cable TV by the way  A fine example is this show TMZ  That's on 630  Uh locally here in New York  On the local Fox station  Okay  That's not cable  No  And they uh refer to celebrities all the time  As being douche 
[00:28:30]  Yeah  I'm like why can't we say it  It's so stupid  For all of CBS  Like even on the evening news  Like when Katie Couric is talking about uh  Ahmadinejad Naran  She'll say he's such a douche  She always stops herself short  Stops short  Of using the full  Wouldn't it be great if a newscaster said that  Oh  Oh what a douche  The most respected newscaster ever  Like Walter Cronkite  And then  That man was a douche  And then  Then came the Tet Offensive 
[00:29:00]  Was actually brought about and organized by a bunch of North Vietnamese douches  Such a good word  It says it all  Douche  It just says it all  It's the one thing the French came up with that we can really like latch on to  Of course  And then we want to do this uh  We want to do this contest on Friday  And uh  Well  Uh  It's a wonderful idea 
[00:29:30]  It really is  As far as uh doing silly radio  It's a great one  We're gonna get a bunch of people in here to do a trivia contest  But uh they gotta do something to ring in  To ring in  To ring in  Yeah  Instead of uh using a buzzer  Right  Or uh something like that you see on a game show  Uh they have to do something naturally  Right  Naturally occurring in the human body  And it makes a noise  And uh that's what they have to do  And until they do that  They can't answer the question  Right  Think uh blazing saddles  Think uh 
[00:30:00]  Of course  Think beans  And uh  Well we can't call it that  We can't call it the word  For what that is  Trivia  Yeah  And this is how ridiculous things are getting  We have to go back and forth with lawyers  And we can't say that word  But we can sell it as this  Coming this Friday to the Opie and Anthony show  It's  Trivia  I can just not let that  So stupid  See people  People might think you're putting your hand under your arm  And doing that 
[00:30:30]  Maybe that's it  It's so  Maybe not  Stupid  This is a good one though for the future  When you look back on just odd things that have happened  And we try to dance around that word  And we were all going  Right  I would love to be fine  No sense  By the FCC  Because we actually said that word  Or uh  Coming this Friday to the Opie and Anthony show  It's  Trivia  Contestants will be asked a series of questions  If two of the four Shakespeare plays 
[00:31:00]  Wrong  And try again  Wrong  A series of simple questions  But in order to buzz in  You'll have to  Want to participate  Visit opiananthony.com  It's  Trivia  Coming this Friday to the Opie and Anthony show  Well you know  It's  It's the  Rules we must abide by  I guess  It's so dumb  That's how it is  It's so dumb  We're living in another age 
[00:31:30]  A new age  A new era  Why can't they just tell the lawyers  This is so  Dumb  Relax already  It's beyond me  But  So there it is  That's the contest  That we're going to attempt to do Friday  Yeah  So  Uh  We got takers  Yeah we'll have takers  I'm sure  I mean I know there are  Guys that just love doing that  We have prizes for it  Jimmy Norton  Although he's not eligible  Would probably be very good at that 
[00:32:00]  Well during the promo  They uh  They said to go to our website  If you want to do this  But I don't know if we're allowed to say our website  So I don't know if that's a new problem  Oh  Unless they cleared it with the guys down the hall  Because we're not really allowed to promote our own website  Well  We have the other website  Whatever that one is  Do we have prizes?  What?  Do we have prizes for the people?  Yeah because we need prizes to give away to the winner  Are we not allowed to say what they are?  Uh  Do we have prizes Steve? 
[00:32:30]  I think it's not so much not allowed  I think it's just best we don't say what they are  Because no one will show up?  We have something from the prize closet  Do we have prizes for  Trivia?  A Queensryche box set  Yeah  Or a Cincinnati Reds hat  The best of SNL  The Phil Hartman years  What are we giving away for?  Trivia  The best of Billy Crystal  On Saturday Night Live  Ugh  What's our prizes for? 
[00:33:00]  Trivia  Anything?  Because that makes sense  Because lawyers know funny  Trivia  This is what you can win  We actually do have some good prizes  They're going out and getting us some gift certificates to  I want to say Best Buy  But I'm not sure exactly what the retailer is  Okay  But they're  I think  The dollar amounts  Don't quote me on this  Are $250, $200, and $100  All right  There you go  Oh, okay  See, now that's a little different than I heard yesterday  Well, because this was  This happened after the discussion yesterday  Ah  By the way 
[00:33:30]  Family Guy also uses the  Thank you  Sean  I'm not going to go  Well, let's go to  Oh, yeah  Family Guy  I've seen it  Sean  Plenty of times  Sean  Yeah  You can't say the word  But basically you're bringing it to our attention  That Family Guy also says the DB word, right?  Yeah  At the end of the show  They, you know  Yep, yep, yep  Ryan moved out when he moves back in  At the very end of the show  The very last thing he says is  Welcome home, douche  And 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, blank  Tell you the truth  Yeah  I mean, who cares?  It's not that big of a deal of a word  But you know what the funny part was?  If my kid was running around after going  Welcome home  And she's three  Welcome home, douche  Welcome home, douche  You know  And I got it on video  So  Right  Well  Yeah  You guys can  A lot of the stuff that the lawyers are doing  Well, okay  Thanks, Sean  A lot of the lawyers  A lot of the things the lawyers are making us  Okay  He's still yapping 
[00:34:30]  Thank you, sir  Like  The FCC is not going to fine you  For saying DB  They're just not  Tommy and Jeremy  What's up?  What that guy was saying about the kid hearing it and saying it  Yeah  You know, it's like when my sister was very young  And we were going to say something  My grandmother would always say  When my sister was in the room  Be careful  Little  Little people have big ears  What?  Because we were going to say cursing  And my  My like three-year-old or five-year-old sister was there  Oh  Well, earmuffs works really well 
[00:35:00]  So they're little but big ears  Big ears  They hear everything  Yes  Earmuffs  Earmuffs  Earmuffs  That grandma had wisdom  Tommy  And she went to dementia  And ate her own shoes  Wisdom quickly turned to dementia  Hey, Tommy  Hi, how are you?  I have a six-year-old and a two-year-old at home  And I watch Nickelodeon with them  And I'm forced to  They say the F word  Not the F word you're thinking about  The other F word  Like a hundred times a day on that show  Yeah  And Nickelodeon even gets to say the word 
[00:35:30]  But Opie and Anthony  Oh, that one, yeah  Oh, I thought you meant the other F word  No, the  Waiting for  I'm thinking  Wow, that Nickelodeon sure has gotten  See, a kid  Racy  A kid's channel is more mature than the Opie and Anthony show  A kid's channel can say the word  But we can't  We have to say  Trivia  Coming soon  But Nickelodeon will tell you what it is  Anyone else seeing how ridiculous this is?  Hey, another observation about TV last night 
[00:36:00]  I was telling Ant  I was watching CNN  Checking out a little news  Seeing what's going on in the world  And they teased some story  Before they went to break  And it's kind of neat that  Or cool, whatever  That TV's finally starting to get it  That we're living in a different world  When it comes to presenting their material  Okay  So the guy's going to break  And he goes  We'll be back in 60 seconds  Which you've heard a million times on TV  And for the first time  I don't know how long they've been doing this 
[00:36:30]  They go to commercial  And at the bottom of the screen  You still see the CNN logo  And this meter  That starts at 60 seconds  And starts, you know, counting down  And you watch the meter, you know, slowly going to zero  Oh, they let you know how much time's left before they come back  Right, and sure enough  As soon as the 60 was over  Boom, they're back with CNN  I sat there through a commercial  For the first time in a long time  Going, oh, wow, that's cool  And I just watched the time count down 
[00:37:00]  With this meter slowly getting shorter and shorter  You know what I mean  Yeah  While the commercial was on  Yeah  Oh, all right  And I'm like  That lets you in on the fact  That you don't have to wait that long  Because I was thinking  I think a lot of people  Think if they say  Well, we'll be back in 60 seconds  People will, you know, register that  But I think in general we don't  Because we see a commercial  We just assume commercials  There's going to be 20 behind it, yeah  Even though they even told you 60 seconds  But now they're showing you  No, it's 60 seconds  And look how fast it goes  When you see a meter, like, slowly going to zero  It goes by real fast 
[00:37:30]  And I stayed with CNN  Probably a little longer than I would have  Because of that  If they made commercials  Like, listen to some of the spots even here  It's like, if you make commercials funny or interesting  People kind of will watch them  See, the problem is  They think that's what they're doing  Oh, it's  Some of these commercials  They really think they're being funny and clever  And no, they're not  Look at what Europe does  Like, you know how they have those European TV bloopers  And, like, the content they get away with in Europe  Yep  Is funny  Yeah, never get away with that here  A lot of commercials are kind of edgy and ballsy 
[00:38:00]  And it's like, you watch them  They're enjoyable  All you got to do is make the commercials funny or interesting  And people will stick with them  Yeah  Stop being cutesy  Cutesy doesn't appeal to most people  You think it does, but it doesn't  We would never get away with that here  Some of the stuff they have in Europe  Amazing  Just full frontal nudity  In a commercial for some antiperspirant  And you know what?  They're less uptight over there  Yeah  They really are  It's out there  It's no big deal  When you hide something  It makes it more of a big deal 
[00:38:30]  Scott in Iowa  What's up?  I want to see it  Hey, love you, love the show  Yep  Linger longer  I was going to say they had a skit on Saturday Night Live  Not that long ago  All about the annual DB awards  Did they actually say the word?  Over and over  I mean  Yeah  This is like  This is what we're dealing with in radio  It's completely out of control at this point  It has TV, everything  Because it has nothing to do with the FCC anymore  It really doesn't  You're not going to get fined for saying DB on a radio show 
[00:39:00]  No  It's not  Thank you, Scott  Let's go to Jimmy in Boston  Jimmy  Yeah, hey  I just wanted you guys to know  I mean  I listen to you guys every day  On BCN  Yep  Yes, I do  And I listen to Tudor and Rich in the afternoon  They use it constantly  No sweat  See, I think it's just us here  Yeah  That's pretty much it  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get at  That's all  Yeah  But does Tudor even know where he is half the time?  That's a good point  Is that just Rich calling Tudor that? 
[00:39:30]  Right  Dude, he had slippers on  The man had slippers on in drive time in the afternoon  It was great  I hope they realize this means we like those guys  Oh, yeah  Who can't?  We're making nothing but alcoholic jokes every day  About Touch and Rich who do afternoons on BCN  I hope they realize that's very endearing  I think they understand that  All right  It's our way of saying hey  You guys all right  They're creeps, believe me  They're not goody-two-shoes  Now touch or comb your hair every once in a while 
[00:40:00]  Dude, he was just  He sat there  He really looked like a mental patient  Like  You know what he reminded me of?  He reminded me of every third guy in Cuckoo's Nest  That went up for the medication  Medication time  Medication time  He was  We were just backstage there at the Halloween show  And he was  I think he was trying to talk  He was trying to communicate something  But it just came out  But he was 
[00:40:30]  Dude, he was  He was completely  He was a really good interviewer  Like he knew everything that was going on with me  And the show  And it wasn't like he was out of it  He was completely present  And asked great questions  And was really good  It was just when you look at him  And you're like, there's no way this guy is going to string together three sentences  No, he  They do a really good show  It's just  It's funny  And thank you, Jimmy  All right  Thank you  See you later  All right  Reports coming in  Of course  Rover in Cleveland  Gets to say  DB  Thank you for that  Jeremy 
[00:41:00]  By the way, good afternoon to Cleveland  Yes  And then you got Rich in Indiana  Rich, what's up?  Yeah  They  Bob and Tom show Friday  Said  DB at least  Ten times  Along with a few other words  You guys aren't allowed to say  Well, but Tom  But Bob and Tom  They're a local show  Oh, that's right  They're not  They're on 120 some odd stations  Are they really?  Yes  Wow  Those guys have got to make 75, 80 grand a year  Perhaps less than that  All right, Rich  Thank you  Yep  All right, so it's Makeup Stuff Tuesday 
[00:41:30]  Yeah  We got a couple really good ones today  Yeah, yeah  We're going to say  We're going to do one about the writer's strike today  Really?  That's a big  Yeah, it just came in  Maybe you don't know  Danny suggested it  I said, yeah  Okay  I kind of like it  And because of the writer's  Topical  Because of the writer's strike  We're going to lose some really, really good TV shows forever  Because they can't wait it out  Oh, and what?  Like the actors are moving on or something? 
[00:42:00]  Everything, yeah  We're writing it up now  But I think we're going to go with like The Office done forever  30 Rock done forever  And maybe we'll throw a third one in there  Maybe for you Lost fans out there  Yuck  But maybe just  A lot of people like that show  You want to go with Lost?  Yeah  All right, so Makeup Stuff Tuesday  The writer's strike has taken out three of our favorite TV shows  Yeah  All right, we're going to write that up during the break  I would go with two  Personally, I would go with two  You know what I'm going to do with three? 
[00:42:30]  You think three?  Yeah  I think three is good  Yeah, three is one of those weird numbers  Three is good  And there could be more  Yeah  Forthcoming  And this is a trend  This is a  Yeah  We're mentioning three  Yeah, I guess three major shows works  We'll figure out which shows  But we're thinking maybe 30 Rock, The Office  I think that  And Lost  That's pretty good  Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman  See what the hottest  Wow  See what the hottest TV shows  We're taking a trip down memory lane  Yeah  Way down  Soap  We're finally cancelling Soap because of the writer's strike 
[00:43:00]  But I didn't know Soap was still on the air  It's like Benson  Syndication is off  No more Benson  And because we have to have two stories every week  Because last week no one fell for the Pat Sajak one  That was the throwaway  No, well he kind of got overshadowed I think  Poor Pat  That was a throwaway story  And they got it wrong anyway  Yeah  They said that he was in an accident  And he did  He fell out of his car  And he broke his teeth  Broke his teeth? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah  Who got it wrong?  I read that  Yeah, his teeth were broken  Meanwhile we said he lost his legs  Oh, that's right  Well, the press never gets anything right  Of course not  I'm doing Rhode Island this weekend  I did an interview with the Rhode Island station  Our affiliate  Yeah  And the guys were asking me about what happened last week  And I'm like  We couldn't believe anybody would buy that  Who would buy that?  Exactly  We're not in news  We're dumbbells  Anyone that would listen to this idiocy  And think it's real  It's just silly  Well, that's why we're doing this  To point out how ridiculous the media really is  You know, let it be known 
[00:44:00]  I love the Pats  And I want them to win the Super Bowl  Simple as that  Cowboys  I don't love the Pats  And I never will  Well, good for you  Dallas  F the Cowboys  I'd love to  Every one of them  Although  In their uniforms  Just drill little holes in the back  Just teach them all  Drill?  Just drill  What are you drilling through?  What are they wearing?  Wood uniforms?  No, they're wearing steel  Like men of iron  Oh, okay  And  Is it wrong?  Let me ask you a question  Is it gay though  If you see like a bunch of guys  Yes  In a huddle  And you see the outside of the circle 
[00:44:30]  And you're like  You know what?  It's like  In that uniform  The asses look good  Well, because they got ass pads  That is really  That is really  Really  Gay  Because those are probably  The manliest men  Not a bit of femininity  About them  Good  So that really  Really makes you  No, no, not me  No, I'm saying you  Makes you  I'm just curious  If that would be  It's a little ass pads  You're curious? 
[00:45:00]  Mmm  And the second story  We're going with  Which is  Some news  From the scientists  Out there  Global warming  Is a huge  Huge issue  These days  So  Certainly is  So for Makeup Stuff Tuesday  We're going to have  A little  Science report  That is  Saying that  The sun's going out  In 200 years  200 years  But it's going to sound good  We're running it up nice  Worded really  Really well  That the sun  Is actually 
[00:45:30]  Somehow burning out  Like a candle  In 200 years  Give or take a few  Use some  You know  Catch words  Yeah  Hydrogen  Yeah we're writing that up  As we speak  Helium  Only 200 years left  What does it really have  Like a billion  Solar flares  How many years  Does it have really  Five billion  Five billion  Five billion  How many  We're having a little trouble  With this one  To be honest  Yeah  Yeah that's a tough one  I think what's going to happen  It's going to swell up  It's going to swell up  No but we don't need 
[00:46:00]  Don't need it to be like that  No no  We just keep it simple  I know what's supposed to happen  But we're not  We're not reporting it that way  See what's supposed to happen  Is going to take billions of years  What we think is going to happen  I guess is  Going to take a lot quicker  Yeah it's just going to go out  Like a candle  Yeah  There's nothing tough about it  We're talking to a lot of dummies  E equals MC 2000  What are you guys saying  You don't think I won't believe it  The theory behind it  Just that  The estimates for how fast the sun is burning  Are off by a magnitude of 5 billion 
[00:46:30]  Alright so  You guys are overthinking this  Trust me  It's Make Up Stuff Tuesday  So Rider Strike is taking out  Three of our favorite shows  And the sun  The scientists  Coming out with a report today  That they're thinking that the sun  Will go out like a candle  In about 200 years  There you go  Now we're not mentioning it  For at least a half hour  So if you're still listening  In a half hour  You'll be in on the joke  Yeah  And we also need your help  By calling this show  And helping this along  Okay

[00:48:00]  Years ago  It was Tupperware parties  Alright we'll go with that then  No it's taser parties  What  I don't get it either  Maybe we can get more info  But this is the news story  Coming in as we speak  We try to  Keep you up to date  On what's happening  So you don't have to  Spin around the dial  We give you basically  The bullet points  For your life  Right  A little of this  A little of that  But taser parties  Yes it's all the rage  I guess  Move over Tupperware  Taser parties  Are apparently up and coming 
[00:48:30]  The new trend for ladies  That's right  Women are snacking on cheese  While listening  To a pitch  For their own personal taser  The host says  They're a must have  For any modern woman  They're light  Colorful  And can fit in a purse  It's light  It's small  It comes in colors  But if you know  You're going to be  In a certain situation  Where you might be  Uncomfortable  Why not have it  With you  It just makes you  More confident  Alright I'm out 
[00:49:00]  I'm bored  Yeah it's  I'm bored  I was excited  I'm like taser parties  Are they hanging around  With like just a little  Lingerie on  And just zap each other  And they just zap each other  See that's  That's what I thought  They need to be  Stimulated in their life  Or something  That is exactly  What I thought  I'm thinking really  Sexy and hot  Everyone has seen  The Sweet Home Alabama  Clip by now  On YouTube  Yeah  Or Break.com  Yeah  Wherever you go  For your videos  Some chicks singing  And all of a sudden  She's got like what  She gets tased  She's got little panties on 
[00:49:30]  And a t-shirt I believe  Or a tank top  Do you have that clip there  You rock  Yeah this clip  Listen to this  Oh that's fantastic  That's a great little  Look at the little boy shorts  You're wearing Janet  More punch 
[00:50:00]  Right  I'm thinking desperate housewives  Hanging around  Yeah  They're bored  They need a little stimulation  In their miserable lives  And they decide  To get together  I'm zapping each other  In the buttocks  I'm kind of thinking like  You know that fight club mentality  But it's like  You know housewives  That are just bored  Yeah  And they all put on  Their little  Little panties  They want a little thrill  And they're hot  And there's some lingerie  And then  They go around the room 
[00:50:30]  You just see one  Like standing in the middle  Of the room  She's like  Okay I'm ready  Alright anytime  Alright here it comes  Alright then she falls down  All you know  Flopping on the floor  With her little lingerie  Flipping over  Did you think the same as me  Or  Yes I did  I'm being completely serious  I'm like wow  We're losing our minds  This is great  When I heard it  That's what I thought  Right  Well no matter what I thought  I didn't realize 
[00:51:00]  It would be the monumentally  Big letdown that it was  Yeah  Like you know  There's just somebody  Showing them tasers  And who cares  Yeah  For their protection  Isn't a taser  A taser though too  I mean with Tupperware  I can almost  Understand maybe  There's some different ones  I don't know  But a taser is a taser  Can we get them now  I thought the citizens  Couldn't have them  Yeah exactly  That's another thing  State by state  I know  On many of the states  There are laws  Against having them  True  You're not allowed  Are they talking about  Tasers or stun guns 
[00:51:30]  Tasers  Tasers are the ones  That like shoot  Just tasers  Those fire the little cables  Into you  You can't sell those  I know  Wait a minute  To walk around with  A stun gun is  Is the thing you hold  That you have to  Actually physically  Touch somebody with  And hit it  Right  But a taser  Is the handheld gun  That fires the little  Wires out  With the barbs  And then  Well  That's a really  Interesting question  I don't know  Yeah I don't know  Which one works 
[00:52:00]  Better you think  Oh the taser rules  You've got to get  Near the guy  How far does it  Shoot the little thing  Pretty far  I think 30 feet  30 feet  Yeah  Two  Alright  Nah you could  Fire from pretty  Far away  But if he has  Clothes on  What do you have  To ask him  To open his shirt  No no  It goes right  Through the clothes  You could just  Hit him with  It could be even  A big furry coat  Yeah  And it'll still nail him  Sam what do you got  I think they're just  Stun guns  They didn't look like  Actual tasers  They weren't tasers  They love using 
[00:52:30]  The word taser now  Instead of stun gun  They were very cute  And designed for women  And pink  Yeah  And glossy  Oh that's nice  Yeah  Everyone reacts  Different to those things  I don't want to give  Anyone a heart attack  Down the hall  But I do believe  We should have  The first  Opie and Anthony  Taser party  A taser party  The way we just  Described  Yeah 
[00:53:00]  Girls in slinky  Lingerie  Hot  Girls that are  Willing to come in here  And take a shot  And take one  I'd love anyone  To get shot  With a taser  No  Young  Hot  Girls  The guy thing  Has been done  You have to think  Pajama party  Sleepover party  Tasers  And culminates  Instead of in a pillow fight  With a little tasering  Yeah  A little stun gunning  Yeah the girls  Running around 
[00:53:30]  Having pillow fights  And talking nasty  About the boys  Yeah  And then it ends  With a nice taser  And they can play  Like a game  Like spin the bottle  And that determines  Who gets tasered  We do two radio shows  A day  What are the odds  This place does it  Hey we'll run it past them  Yeah  You never know  And what are the odds  The other place will do it  Not good  Not good on both fronts  What if we got like  The law enforcement involved  I like this 
[00:54:00]  It's a demonstration  But the girls  Who are getting  Demonstrated on  They have to wear  Tiny little boy shorts  And some kind of  Top with no problem  Yeah  XM and CBS  Are both in agreement  With one thing  Neither one of them  Wants to have a heart attack  And be sued  On that one  Well those things  Are safe  As long as you know  Hey man  They've done it  On TV shows  Of course  They did it on that  Dumb reality show  Where they had celebrities  Turn into cops  For a couple weeks  Yeah  With what's his name  Freaking  Punch 
[00:54:30]  Yeah  Yeah  What  Erica  Yeah  Erica Strada  Yeah  And Trish Strada  From WWE  He bought property  From Erica Strada  Swampland in Florida  Hey we got more examples  Of what our taser party  Would sound like there  Iraq  Alright  You could get the girls  I don't know  Kind of hanging around  And doing some karaoke  Or singing some fine songs  That'd be nice  Yeah  Here's another example  Of what we want  To have happen on our show  A taser party 
[00:55:00]  A real taser party  Happy birthday to you  Come on  How funny would this be  Oh we gotta do this  They're safe  We used to have teen parties  Yeah  This is  Like can't we just have  Girls come in  Scantily clad  And then just  Zap them with a stun gun  For the people that  You know  Linger longer  Remember our teen parties  Just imagine teen party 
[00:55:30]  With all the hotness  And then you throw in  The taser thing  Yeah  Here's another example  Of what our party  Would sound like  Jingle  Jingle  All the way  See it's quick  Yeah  It's a quick shot  Like holding it down  Until you know  Until you turn  Just a quick shot  Just enough for them  To screech a little bit  Yeah let's say hi  To Dave in Boston  Dave  Hey what's going on guys  Hey  Love you  Love the show 
[00:56:00]  So a couple of years ago  In the middle of the summer  We're having a party  And my dumb ass niece  Decides to pull out  This homemade taser  Basically I wish  We could have taken pictures  But she destroyed  A disposable camera  To make a homemade taser  And she's running around  Going look here  Try it  So everybody's getting  Shocked by this damn thing  They're going oh damn  It hurts  Do it again  She's like what  Yeah it probably wasn't  You know full power  No  It was made out of a camera  I've seen that online  Hey I'm just sitting around  Getting drunk  Watching everybody 
[00:56:30]  Getting shocked  I'm just like wow  This is great  Do it again  Well  Well let's see if the women  Are willing to do this  How many hot women  Out there listening to us  Would be willing to come in  For a taser party  Yeah you just  You're going to do  Full power taser  Or you're going to do  A little camera taser  Just enough to get  A nice reaction  It's going to be  A regular taser  But you know  As they're wearing  Their tiny little outfits  Little shot  Quick little  Yeah  By law enforcement  Not us  Yeah 
[00:57:00]  Maybe there's some kind  Of demonstration  They do on a regular basis  Anyway  Right  We just got to bring  The hotness into it  And we're there  I'm telling you  We're close  I like it  We're so close  Let's go to Chris  In Syracuse  Chris what's up  Hey what's going on guys  Hey  I just want to comment  On how funny  The reactions are  To some of the people  Nothing funnier  Than someone being  Stun gunned  Or tasered  You sound like  You're having a ball  Over there  I gotta tell you  How funny this is  It's like someone  Getting castrated 
[00:57:30]  Almost  Almost  Well what's great too  Is it's just  The attitude  Is adjusted immediately  Oh yeah  They go from like  I ain't listening  To nothing  You have to say  All belligerent  Let me tell you  Something  All right  All right  Okay  Okay  Okay  Come for me  Come for me  I think we talked  About this at length  On a past show  Where you go from  That major attitude  To completely obeying

[00:59:30]  Taser party  Yeah  Let's at least  Get things rolling  Before it comes  Crashing down around us  It is being pointed out  That uh  CBS won't allow us  To say the F word  For like passing  You know what  After you have like  Hot dogs and beans  But they're gonna  They're gonna go  For this idea  We are dreamers  That's all  We like to dream  We just wanna work  For a company  That sees it our way  That's all  We like to um  That's the ultimate goal  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Just see it our way  We just like to uh 
[01:00:00]  Come up with these ideas  Uh huh  And talk about them  We're idea men  Sometimes they uh  They can't pan out  But  I like this one  But the girls are calling in  Like uh  Well  Like  Like crazy  Let's say hi to Max  Calling in like hotcakes  I was gonna say  Yeah  I've never gotten a call  From a hotcake ever  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas  He's good for one every day  What's up Max  What do you got today  What's going on fellas  Hey  I was gonna say uh  Tasers  In the shape of 
[01:00:30]  Marital aid  For disgruntled husbands  Jesus  You're a violent man  I got a couple ex-wives  What can I say  Okay  Then I can't fault you sir  Gosh  God wants to taser him like that  And someone is  Well Jay  I mean  Oh that's a funny idea  Right there  And the listeners  Help us out  As we  We throw the  This is how the show works  We just throw a crazy idea  Out there  And then we hone it  Right in front of your eyes  That's it  Jay in Jersey  What's up  Hey what's going on guys 
[01:01:00]  Hey  How's it going  Great to do  When you guys are playing  You guys are having your taser party  You have the girls play musical chairs  Right so when the music's going around  They're going around the chairs  As soon as the music stops  The one who's standing  Bam  They get tased  That is good  So then there's a chance  That you don't get tased  Perfect  Yeah  Yeah  You know how stressful that game is  Like when you're little  You know you're sweating it out  But crap  Imagine when you got a taser waiting for you  I like it  It could be one of the games we play  Maybe we just come up with all sorts of taser games 
[01:01:30]  Yeah  Like party games  That we turn into taser games  God I want this to happen  Like you wouldn't believe  Can we get the law enforcement on the air  Spin the taser  We need hot girls to call  We need law enforcement to call  To see what are the possibilities of doing this  It might be pretty  You know  A big possibility  Even if we just do it in your house  And just put it on YouTube  How about a variation of  Spin the tail on the donkey  It's a target  Like a dartboard on the wall  And you spin the girl around  And blindfold her  Yeah  And if she completely misses the target 
[01:02:00]  She gets tased  She won't even know that she's missing it  It's a surprise tasing  Like the second she sticks the pin in the wall  Bam  With her blindfold on  She'll never see it coming  Pin the electricity on the horse  That'd be great  We got it  Is it a taser instructor  Or a tase instructor  I never know  Probably taser  Let's go with taser instructor  It's Dave  What's up Dave  Hey what's going on guys  Hey  I'm a police officer upstate 
[01:02:30]  I'm a taser instructor  The stuff you saw on TV  They're actually tasers  They shoot the prongs out  Yeah  For civilians  They shoot a lesser voltage  Than the ones that the police officers use  And right now  There's four or five states  In the United States  That they're illegal  New York, Connecticut  And New Jersey  They're illegal  Of course  Of course  Yeah why should we be able to defend ourselves  With anything  I know where you need them the most  Why can't we just be  Sheep walking around 
[01:03:00]  Victims waiting to just be victimized  Exactly  Can't defend ourselves  I'll tell you  I've been hit  When I went through the training  I got hit by it  And it's  It knocked your ass down  It's awesome  Alright so  Is this a possibility?  Yeah  Like I think  You'd have to have a police officer do it  I don't know if they'd be able to  Oh yeah  But it is the illegal in New York State  For a civilian to possess a taser  Oh I know I know  We want to do this on the up and up  We want like law enforcement involved  And really hot girls  And really  Oh legit  Really skimpy outfits 
[01:03:30]  Someone's suggesting the electric dog shock collars  That would work pretty much the same  Oh that's nice too  But you know  We could have that as well  It's not as intense in the voltage  No it's not as intense  But boy they would scream  And we got to change the name of our party  There you go  Electric dog collar shock party  Lingerie  Hot teens  Extravaganza  Shocker collar  Boy shorts  Braless  Party  Shock collars are pretty good 
[01:04:00]  Alright we're honing  We're doing good here Dave  Thank you  Okay  Alright there goes Dave  He's an instructor  So uh  Well that's good too  Negro  Yeah of course  Um  I wonder what the odds of this happening are  Uh  Somewhere  You know where Slim is?  Hey  Yes  And then the nun portion  Well it is good to talk about  I mean we do have uh  Our big uh  Our big uh  Uh  Contest coming up Friday  In case you weren't listening earlier  Yes  Coming this Friday to the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:04:30]  It's  Trivia  Contestants will be asked a series of questions  Two of the four Shakespeare plays  And  Try again  A series of simple questions  But in order to buzz in  You'll have to  Want to participate?  Visit opiananthony.com  It's  Trivia  Coming this Friday to the Opie and Anthony show  Yeah if you're hearing that for the first time  There's a word obviously missing  Because the lawyers don't think that we should be able to say that word with trivia  Yeah 
[01:05:00]  So we have to call  Trivia  This is what we deal with on a regular basis  You're making the raspberry sound  And then they wonder why I'm going completely insane in front of everyone's eyes  But uh  But we're still doing it  And you still have to do that to uh  To answer the trivia question  Right  And then I'm getting a list of uh  Channels that use that word  Like it's  Like it's the word  The  Like PBS  PBS  It's on CW 
[01:05:30]  It's on The Simpsons  It's on Dirty Jobs  It's on Las Vegas  It's on South Park  Just a few  Wait a minute  Why would PBS play that?  Huh?  That was during  Uh  That specific reference  There's more  But the specific one that I had looked at  Was a documentary about elephants  Oh  And they use that word to describe that function  On PBS  On PBS  We have that audio?  We have it  I could definitely get it if you'd like it  Yeah we're getting audio of uh  Very very tame shows using that 
[01:06:00]  Exact word  Yeah  So instead we have to call  Trivia  So there you have it  Alright  Really?  Disney Channel uses it?  Of course they do  That's fantastic  Nickelodeon  We can't be as cutting edge  And racy  As the Disney Channel  We gotta change the intro to this show 
[01:06:30]  Cause it's all about being shocking  And shock jocks  Shock jocks  And we can't even be as shocking as Nickelodeon  That's the reality  Oh my god  That's the reality  Uh well  And there's ongoing discussions  This isn't like  They  We had to discuss this with lawyers  Oh yeah  It was  And then they finally said  Alright  We'll allow you to say  Trivia  In the uh  In the old days  You know  We would  Would have just gone on and done it 
[01:07:00]  But uh  It's a new day and age  People are keeping tabs on you  All the time now  Uh  They're watching  Listening  Come running in  No  God forbid you say that word  Yeah  What'll happen  Buildings will fall down  And the earth will turn over  Alright  We're gonna take a break here  Someone out there just won a thousand dollars  I see the phone's ringing like crazy  We'll see who won that  After the break  And we got other things  It's Opie and Anthony 
[01:07:30]  Stay there  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show  Who won the thousand dollars  Let's say hi to Angela  And uh  Angela where are you from  Huh  Queens  Hey what's up Angela  Congratulations  You just won a thousand dollars  Thank you so much  A grand we like to call it  A cool grand  A grand  What are you gonna do with the thousand dollars  Oh god  I have no idea  Maybe buy a Christmas present  Yeah  Do you listen to the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:08:00]  For others  I do all the time  I've never won anything in my life  Well there you go  Never  See how easy it is  Uh never  I know  And I thought I was a lucky person  Yeah  Well now you are  So much  Alright  Thank you Angela  Congratulations  We just wanted to give you a little air time  Thank you  There you go  Alright  Take care  In honor of our taser party  That we're trying to get together  I guess it's more fun to just  Discuss how cool it would be  Than actually do it 
[01:08:30]  Uh here's tomorrow's sound  I think I got it  Panty party  Panty party  Well maybe we can do this  Hold on  Panty party  Okay  Can we put the two together for tomorrow's sound  Absolutely  Please do that  Alright sometime between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow  You're gonna hear this  Panty party  Just clean it up a little bit 
[01:09:00]  So it sounds a little uh  A little more realistic  We're gonna play that between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow  When you hear that  Be the 10th caller  At 877-212-ON-A  And you're gonna win $1,000  The fart argument  Has continued  By the world  That uh  That was just  And I'm  I'm  Hysterical by the way  I'm discussing it on a professional level  And then Tom's like  You know  Are you gonna continue breaking my balls  I'm not trying to break Tom's balls  And I try to tell him that 
[01:09:30]  I understand what he's trying to do for the show  But we gotta point out  As a radio show  How ridiculous  The process is  When it comes to these things  A conversation about that  Is just  So ludicrous  I like to make believe  I'm just out of college  But I really am a grown man  And Tom's a grown man  And we're sitting here  Arguing about the word  And I'm sitting here like  This is completely insane  Yeah  It is  Very  And Jimmy  And Jimmy was just sitting there  Dumpfounded  Cause it's 
[01:10:00]  Mind boggling  It really is mind boggling  And that's all I was trying to tell Tom  I understand that he got the contest  On the air for us  Thank you  Thank you Tom  You're great  Thank you  But  It still remains that  This is completely ridiculous  What we're dealing with  Well  I don't get it  I know  And I'm like  It's just silly stuff  It's nothing like  Really hardcore  Or  That's gonna get you in trouble  It's just  It's amazing how like  I don't know what happens to people  When they go into the legal profession  Like where they just  Hand their genitals over at the door 
[01:10:30]  And go  Alright  That's it  We don't need these anymore  Like what happens to people  When they go to law school  I don't know  They just lose all sense of like  What people enjoy  Yeah  They really do  They lose touch of what  What like average people  Maybe because  In their circles  They don't talk about that stuff  I just don't get  How they are completely  So out of touch  With what  Like I'm talking about lawyers  With what people like  I don't get it  I happen to think  By the way  Why do you think it was hilarious  You were in the bathroom  You didn't hear any of that  Oh no I heard it before 
[01:11:00]  I went in there  Oh okay  I was just like  Oh my god  Here we go again  Yeah  It's been an ongoing discussion  For  We're getting close to two weeks  And believe me  I heard  I heard plenty  And it was just like  It's the simplest concept  For a dumb radio show  That's just  Trying to entertain  And make people laugh  We thought it would be  A throwaway  Like alright  We're going to do this thing  We're going to have people  Do something  As their buzzer  To answer  Very basic trivia questions  It would be hilarious  And fast  And it would kill a Friday  As far as 
[01:11:30]  Doing a radio show  And I'm like  Alright let's do it  And then all of a sudden  Like emails started  Being thrown around  And phone calls  Well we can't call it this  Well we can't even do it  But now we can do it  But you can't mention this word  It's  Yeah  Part of the  The new world order  That we have to deal with  Pathetic society  It's  Yeah  It's  It's rough  And then he doesn't think  That's interesting  To the people out there  To at least discuss  How silly it is  Oh it is  I think it's really interesting 
[01:12:00]  Believe me it is  To discuss how silly  Sometimes  Sometimes  It's  More entertaining  To just discuss  How ridiculous something is  Than actually do it  Right  Because it  It gets to the point  Where you start thinking about it  And go  Eh you know something  Screw the  Idea  But talking about  The process involved  To try to get it  On the air  Is  Grown men  Great stuff  By the way  Grown men  Grown men  It's not like  Third graders sitting around  Like giggling  As they try to say the word  It's like  Grown men going 
[01:12:30]  I go  Tom I don't understand  Just make me understand  Why we can actually  Do the contest  But we can't call it  The word  Trivia  That's all  And I don't need to  Come down the hall  Please  We'll try to move on here  Yeah  And it is interesting  To our listeners  Because  It's the same radio show  Where we actually sat around  In a conference room  Mind you  Back in the day  For three straight years  By the way  And put together  A sex contest  That we broadcasted  Live on a radio show 
[01:13:00]  Yup  That involves  Sponsorships  Ended in our firing  But  Right  After the third year  Yeah  But that's why  This is interesting  To the listeners  To show you  What the heck  Has happened  In the last  Five or six years  We gotta change  The opening  Just to reflect  How edgy we are  We really go  We're shock jocks  We say tush  We see a nice pair  Of breasts  And we wink 
[01:13:30]  And go  Uh huh  And I don't want to  Take Tom's words  Out of  You know  Context  But he says  I'm getting tired  Of arguing  He said that to me  And I'm like  You know what  I will argue  For this radio show  Right up to the day  They say we're gone  That's just how  I have to be  But Tom  And I will do it  In an intelligent way  As much as I can  Tom is tired of arguing  And that's what  He's been around  For a long time  He helped build 
[01:14:00]  K-Rock to what it is  Yeah  Um you know  And it's like  After a while  You probably get tired  Of fighting  And bitching  And all that stuff  And you just want  To relax  And play  That's what I would  Want to do  I wouldn't want  To hear this nonsense  I wouldn't want  To spend more than  30 seconds  On arguing about  On the F word  Which is  You know  Now  Whatever  A couple of people  Whose combined ages  Over 100  Were arguing over  The word fart  It wasn't even an argument  It was just  It was just  A really  A weird discussion 
[01:14:30]  A little discussion  About  He doesn't even  Like what he's saying  Tom knows  He's not a dope  He's not  You can tell  When he is talking  About this  He does not  Even want to deal  With having to  Talk about  Words like that  In a serious  Business like fashion  He's very  Tom's very stiff  When he stands  He'll stand there  And his arms come out  And his hands  Have this really  The only loose part  Of him is his hands  Like it's really weird  Like he's a very  Like a stiff guy  But his hands  Seem to have  Like joint problems  Like he just puts 
[01:15:00]  His hand out  And they flop down  And he's very fluid hands  He'd probably be  A very good surgeon  Here he comes  He's back  Oh no  I already said that  It's nothing personal  I don't  Listen  I don't take it personally  He's an alpha male  When I said  Don't come down the hall  He had to come down the hall  I just want to acknowledge that  To everybody out there  I'm not stupid  I'm a younger  I'm a younger alpha male  To his older alpha male  Very fluid hands  As soon as I said  Don't come down the hall  Of course he jumped  Out of his chair  No but if you're gonna  If you're gonna just  Make the conversation 
[01:15:30]  About me  Then I need to be here  I actually defended you  And said that  It's not about you  It's not about me  But it's about the conversation  And I've been having  These conversations  For 20 plus years  And you just had it  No no no  You know what  It's come down to the  I can't  I mean I deal with  Harvard educated  You know  Penn educated people  All the time  About this stupid  Most ridiculous stuff  In the world  And you know  Do you think it's stupid?  Oh I think the conversations  Are stupid  No no  You think what the lawyer said  About 
[01:16:00]  No I didn't say that  I said the conversation  Is stupid  But this is the business  We're in  Just say fart  You know  Just say what?  Just say fart  Say  What do I want  To say that for?  Why wouldn't you?  You're a guy  Right  In the right context  You know  I have said that word  Plenty of times  What word?  I'm not going to say it  Just make me feel like  He got me to say it  What word?  It's a room full of men  What better time  Oh my god  This is awful  Just say the word  No  Just say the word  No  No  No  Because you want me to  Now I won't  How about just turd?  Why? 
[01:16:30]  Why wouldn't you?  It's a great word  It feels good  Coming off the tongue  In the right conversation  At the right time  I'd be happy to use that word  How about turd cutter?  Turd  What would the right time  Now you guys  Now we've got to push it  Probably  What would the right time  Be to say fart though  In a conversation?  Maybe you'd ask  Somebody if they just did that  Right  So we're allowed  Did you just fart?  Right  Yeah  So are we allowed  To say the word  But we're not allowed  To say it  As far as the contest goes  I just said  I said you could say the word  What I didn't want  Was that the contest 
[01:17:00]  To be titled that  I understand that  That requires some subtlety  On your part  So  But you also  It's ridiculous  No no hold on  It really is  Subtlety is right  I agree with subtlety  I understand that  But there are times  Where this is actually  To me  What we wanted to call it  Is creatively  The better way to do it  Even though subtlety  Most times is good  In this case  It just  Sometimes people like  Will sacrifice  What's truly funny  Just to be subtle  But is the word funny  Or is the sound funny  And the effluvia  That the action 
[01:17:30]  That the action leaves  Is that funny?  To me it's the sound  And the smell that it leaves  Is really what makes it funny  That's all part of it  You take one glorious photo  And you're trying  That's like saying  The last supper  Well I thought the Christ  Was the best part  Really I thought it was  Judas on the end  It's just one giant thing  With a fart  It's everything  It's the sound of it  To call the contest that  It's the way it makes people feel  It's everything about it  That makes it funny  I would say  I would say  It's a beautiful menagerie of things 
[01:18:00]  Right  Put together in one  How many F words  Aren't we allowed to say  At this point?  There's a lot of them now  Might as well just take that  Well I only know of one  No  No  There's another one  There's the big one  Right  And then there's the one  That used to be used  In the schoolyard  When you would tell  A little playmate  That he was being one  Because he wouldn't go out  Oh gotcha  Yeah you can't use that one  Well yeah  In certain contexts  And you can't say  The other one  If it's followed by trivia  Right  Or you can say it other ways 
[01:18:30]  How about this?  Can we say fag trivia?  No  Can we say what trivia?  Fag trivia  Of course not  Why not?  Why?  How would you play that?  Is it about sticks?  Yes  A bundle?  Yeah a bundle of sticks  Or cigarettes  Thank you  By the way I love having  These conversations  With Anthony  Walks out in the middle of him  He had to go to the bathroom  I really did have to  And I knew I wouldn't be able to  I even missed eating my cantaloupe  It brought him back  To his parents fighting  Yeah it actually did 
[01:19:00]  He had to leave the studio  All of a sudden Tom turned into daddy  And I thought you were going to  Throw spaghetti against the wall  Next time I'll bring spaghetti  And throw it on the wall  I'll start crying  Okay  Don't make me cry  I'm very bad when I start crying  This has been fun  But I must be about my business  All right  See that's what Tom wants to do too  He doesn't want to deal with  Like the words and this  And the two things  He likes being  It's my job though  I have no problem doing my job  No I know you have no problem  Doing your job  But you'd rather be doing like  You know the conference calls 
[01:19:30]  And the executive things  And just networking a little bit  This is fun  Yeah  Okay  Somebody was suggesting  That the word be used  In this context  Tom is an old fart  If they won't choose to believe that  Allow them  That happens to not be the case  But  That is from the pal talk crowd  It wasn't you saying that  No no  I was just  I'm simply reading  Why don't you read other  Comments on pal talk  Please  My reading ability here 
[01:20:00]  No I  That was it  Okay  That was it  Alright boys  And we're going to announce  That we can't do  Homeless shopping spree too  By the way  Okay  Well you can't  You choose not to  No we can't  We can't  We need to do it over here  But there's no malls open  At 6 in the morning  There aren't  No  We want to do  Homeless shopping spree  We just can't  We're not allowed to  You can't  No one shops at 6 in the morning  Even Christmas Eve  Yeah  It's just too creepy  At 6 in the morning  To go shopping  The malls aren't open 
[01:20:30]  No I understand that  But we need an afternoon drive  And you said  Record it and play it back  It was what we said  You could do  Record it how  On tape  On CDs  Ah see Tom  I won't tell you how to sell  Let's just put it that way  Okay  Good  It's impossible to do that show on tape  You know that right  You need the live interaction  Of the people  There  Seeing it all go down  And you call  And people are calling  Saying we're on our way  And this is what's happening  Right now here  And it's a live event 
[01:21:00]  So kind of  It wouldn't work on tape  Because you wouldn't have  That live interaction  Otherwise  We couldn't be in a studio  Broadcasting it  So people couldn't hear it  And then go check it out  And then call in  And hear what we're reporting  It wouldn't make sense  We could be  We get a lot of people there  With microphones  Talking to people about  You know the fact that  You're there doing it  But it's your call  No it's not our call  We want to do it  In afternoon drive  The way we did it last year  It's not our call  Because you guys  Don't want us to do it  In afternoon drive  Or on the weekend  Because you don't believe 
[01:21:30]  In the show that much  To have it take up  More time  Those are your words  Not mine  Alright Tom  It's hurtful  It's hurtful  We're not all  Muscle and toughness  You know  We have sensitive sides  We certainly do  We're girls deep down  Yeah we're going to  Announce that today  That we can't do  Homeless shopping  He says it's our choice  But you can't do it  We want to do it  Exactly like last year  We do it in afternoon drive  And then we play it back  The next morning  During our morning show 
[01:22:00]  But they don't want us  To do it in afternoon drive  On their radio station  Here in New York  And then we said  Alright well we'll do it  On the weekend  Like we did last year  And they didn't want us  To do that either  And so now Tom's saying  It's our choice  That we're not doing it  But we can't  Do it live  Between 6 and 9  Because I think  The malls open up at 9  That'll be a really quick spree  It's one of our greatest  Yeah a quick spree  It's one of our greatest bits  I think we've done it  What five years  Something like that 
[01:22:30]  Yeah it's  I don't know  At least maybe four years  Never been a problem  At least dude  Never been a problem  We bring our homeless friends in  We get them a bus  We bring them to a mall  Thousands of our listeners  Showed up last year  Thousands  No joke  You can go on YouTube  We don't make up crap  On this show  You can see for yourself  Thousands of people  Watching the homeless shop  You know what it is  Oh my god really  In Boston  The mayor got upset  And made comments last year  And said it was this  Or it was that 
[01:23:00]  And meanwhile  The homeless are treated  Like rock stars  And they get free stuff  Right  No one does anything bad  To the homeless  It's one time every year  Where we like to do it  In afternoon drive  Because it's obvious  That's the perfect time  To go to a mall  Yeah  And it was told  You can't do it in the morning  It was told they didn't want us  To do afternoons on this station  Or on the weekends  So then we had to say  Well I guess we're not doing it  So I guess that's where  It's our choice  But we really can't do it  Unless it's in afternoons  That's just how it goes  It's too bad 
[01:23:30]  Because it's a great event  Every year  It's a great event  Yeah  People love it  Homeless get to shop  The listeners get really into it  And throw all sorts of money  At the homeless  And to homeless charities  We try to throw a little charity  Element into the whole thing  Yeah and for some reason  It's perceived as just an awful thing  I don't know why  We got massive coverage last year  On Fox News Channel  And CNN  I'm looking at a clip right now  You can't allow the Boston mayor  He was wrong  His perception of it was incorrect  It wasn't right  What's exploitive of the homeless 
[01:24:00]  Is him and the rest of the people in Boston  Those politicians counting homeless people  And doing nothing for them  That's what's exploitive  We pick them up  They're bums  We take them there  And they get free stuff  And people cheer them  Bums  People cheer for them  You are a bum  They get off the bus  And people are screaming  And buying them things  Yeah  Honestly  How many people last year?  2,000 to 3,000 at the mall?  At least  At least  I'm being told  Okay  Someone's saying 
[01:24:30]  Black Friday  They do open at 6 a.m.  The malls  I thought we were beyond segregation and stuff  Why can't  That's the day after  Thanksgiving  Oh  Oh I'm sorry then  I didn't know  Sometimes I just sound so stupid  Alright we're gonna regroup  And we'll continue after the break  We got some other things  We got the grandma that was strip searched  At Yonkers Raceway Casino  It's a great story  It's just terrific 
[01:25:00]  Alright it's Opie and Anthony  Hi this is Adam Ferrara  Where am I gonna be?  Well I will tell you  November 14th through the 18th  That will be at Hilarities in Cleveland, Ohio  For tickets call 216-736-4242  422-216-736-4242 
[01:25:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  What else is going on in the world today?  The Cain West mother dies  Kanye  I say Cain  Kanye  Kanye West mother dies  Apparently a little problem with some  Reconstructive surgery  What was she having?  Plastic surgery or something?  I think lipo  Lipo?  I thought she had a heart attack 
[01:26:00]  Or had something else going on  But then you learn more  That she went in for some procedure  And she dies  I thought that lipo and all that stuff  Was kind of safe  I thought they had that down  Every once in a while  Someone bites it  I don't know  Yeah Kanye West mother  I'm a little distracted  So it looked like  Cain  For a second  Cain  Also coming out today  One in three women  Who meet someone online  Have sex on the first date  One in three?  That seems a bit high 
[01:26:30]  No?  Hmm  Yeah but  Jimmy  One in three women  Who meet someone online  Have sex on the first date  Here's an expert  A low expert  That's probably because  Online you talk to people  For a while  So they feel like they know you  As opposed to  Sitting face to face  On a first date  By the time you have  A first physical date  Online I'm going to guess  That you've talked for many  Many times  Instant message  You probably feel like  You know the person better  Does that count  Like Craigslist  Something like that  Oh what  That jacked up the stats 
[01:27:00]  Yeah that might  Jack up the stats  Yeah  So while you're thinking  People are chatting online  Then they finally meet  They really do know  Each other pretty well  Yeah like they know  What they like sexually  A little bit  They've probably gotten  Dirty a little bit  You know you've gotten  Loving Ruskay  And I think when you  Talk to someone online  You have no choice  But to really  You know communicate  Because it's not  A visual thing  So you are saying  Oh what's your favorite movie  What's your favorite album  That came out last year  What's your favorite TV show  What's your favorite  Sexual position  What oops  And you can talk to  A couple different people 
[01:27:30]  At once  You have all those  Instant messenger things open  So it's almost like  You can weed out  All the awful ones quickly  Yeah I think you can  Like if you're looking  To just hook up  Have some sex  Yeah  Then you'll just  You'll wait  Until you find that  So you're weeding out  The people that  You're not going to  Have sex with  So by the time  You meet them  To go out  You know live  You pretty much both  Know what the hell  You're in it for  So maybe that  Kind of jacks it up too  Right also 
[01:28:00]  We got the Pope  Visiting the US  Holding mass  At Yankee Stadium  Isn't that great  Is he still alive  Yankee Stadium  Yeah that guy  He's not a very  Popular Pope  Nah  He's not like  A showboat Pope  He doesn't have  That charisma  That Pope John Paul  Had  He has creepy eyes  Yeah  Yeah  He looks  Well yeah  He's a little creepy  Maybe I shouldn't  Make my pedophile joke  That would be  But he does kind of  Have a certain look  About him  Looks creepy  Yeah  And there was that  Controversy about him  Being in the 
[01:28:30]  Hitler Youth  Yeah  He was kind of  In the Hitler Youth  But you know  So long ago  Whatever  It's like the Boy Scouts  For them back then  It was  They just  They didn't know  You're just kind of  You're a kid  You're in the Hitler Youth  Right  And now he's the Pope  So he's coming in  To New York  He's going to visit  The UN  And screw up  Every bit of traffic  Here in the city  Which is always wonderful  To deal with  A Pope  When's he coming?  April I think  Why? 
[01:29:00]  Does anyone  What's he going to say?  Well I was  Listening to some  People on the street  Interviews  You know  The regular Joe  On the street  That was always good  And they had a woman  That was very excited  About it  Said that she thinks  It'll be wonderful  That the Pope's coming here  At this point in time  We really need him  And his faith  Especially the young people  Is what she said  Has the Pope ever affected  Any 
[01:29:30]  Like the last Pope  That visited  You know  He sells out  Like Dane Cook  Yeah  He sells out these places  But  I don't think  It has any effect  On crime  Or anything like that  I don't think  I think he's pretty much  Preaching to the converted  You know  Quite literally  I think they gotta get  A little hipper  At the Vatican  I don't think  That's gonna happen  I know  It's never gonna happen  You want the buddy Christ  With the thumbs up  I'm saying just  The buddy Christ  Right buddy Christ  They just gotta get  Slightly hipper 
[01:30:00]  And you can maybe  Get a youth movement going  I don't know  Yeah  Bring some of the  The youths of America  Back to the church  That's what I think  Well good luck  The rules are too old  The youths should be  Running from the church though  Quite frankly  The rider strike is  Holding their hands  Behind them  The rider strike  Is continuing  Yeah  I guess Ellen  Crossed the picket line  Right  Her excuse  I was really against it  And they said that  The reason she did  Or what her justification is  Is that like the people  She's competing with 
[01:30:30]  Are all working  And the reason is  None of them employ  Writers Guild workers  But she did  And that's why I guess  She's justifying going back  Which I'm not saying  It's right or wrong  So she's saying  Hey look I was good  I actually employed these guys  But my competition  None of them were  And they're all working  So I'm gonna lose my  And maybe she has a valid point  It's not like  It was kind of like  An uneven deck  Like  I mean  They're all  She's gonna be  In New York next week too  So that's gonna be  Really interesting  Are they gonna set up  The big giant rat  They have been  In front of 
[01:31:00]  Ellen's studio  I checked the  The boys out  One afternoon  The big giant rat  Hysterical whenever  They protest  Here  They got the big pig  With the cigar  The pig with the cigar  I like the rat  They alternate  They got the rat  And then they got  The big pig  Smoking the big stogie  The big cigar  Like a fat cat  Yeah  I like the rat though  It's a giant gray rat  Big red nose  And he's standing  On his hind legs  And they blow him up  With  You know like  They blow up  Those little bouncy rides  At kids fairs 
[01:31:30]  And stuff like that  Right  And they blow him up  And he stands out there  Implying that  Whoever is in there  That they're protesting against  Is a giant rat  I wish they could make it  Look a little more fun  That big rat is creepy  He's scary  The big rat  It really does  It really does the job  He scares me  It must suck to be a business owner  And all of a sudden  That thing is being inflated  Outside your business  You don't want to hear  Oh no  You don't want to hear  The generator kick up  And then the compressor  Look out your window  And see the giant rat 
[01:32:00]  And it's a  It's a  Yeah  It's an inflatable  So probably at first  You're like  Oh boy  Disney's in town  Oh this is fun  They're starting a special promotion  For us  This is going to help my business  Because they're putting  Some kind of attraction  Right in front  Some kind of inflatable  Oh  Oh no  It's the giant rat  Wait a minute  It's gray  What characters  Oh no  Oh they're picketing  Why wouldn't you just hit him  With a BB gun  If you owned a business  And he was out in front of you  Why wouldn't you shoot that BB  Shoot the giant rat  Of course  Find his beady red eyes 
[01:32:30]  Because then the teamsters  Would you know  Yeah  Then they'd pull out  The two by fours  And they would bury you  At giant stadium  They'd do the  The protesting  The old school way  Yeah  With boards  Yeah  And pipes  Why do they have to show  The undercarriage of the rat  By the way  We're looking at the inflatable  And you see the undercarriage  Where the uh  Rat's got some goods  Where the youngins would  You know  Suckle  What is that  Why do they need that  On the rat  It's a little bear belly  Because he's crawling around  Like a rat  Yeah  Alright 
[01:33:00]  I don't like the way  The rat  And the teamsters rat  Is just sitting on its hind legs  Like a big bear  He's got his claws up  Like a bear  But that's not the way rats are  No  They should have him  Slithering under a doorjamb  They should have a giant  A giant doorjamb  With a half a rat  Slithering under it  Creepily  That is effective  Or creepy  Or a giant baby  With a rat  Running across its face  So speaking of the  Rider Strike  Here's the latest  As the Hollywood  Rider Strike  Enters its second week  NBC has announced  That it has  Cancelled  Three of its  Top rated sitcoms 
[01:33:30]  The Dredge Report  Is reporting that  NBC has cancelled  Are you ready for this?  The Office  30 Rock  And My Name is Earl  Now why aren't they  Just sitting down  Like the rest of the shows?  Sources tell Dredge  That the cancellations  Are a result of  The growing rift  Between NBC  And Steve Carell  Tina Fey  And Jason Lee  The head writers  Actors of these three shows  That seems to be  Where the problem is  Where you got the  Rider actors  They're kind of  Losing out on  Two paychecks  And they probably 
[01:34:00]  Just want to move on  And yeah  I guess it would be  Instead of kind of  A professional thing  Like the writers  Protesting  And then management  Inside  This is kind of  They're put in  A weird position  So  Whatever they  Feel like they  Got to do  Carell, Fay, and Lee  Are all members  Of the Writers Guild  Of America  And have refused  To cross picket lines  While most networks  Have postponed  And shut down  Production on shows  NBC is the first  Network to flat out  Cancel any of their  Programming  Once again  Canceling  The Office 
[01:34:30]  30 Rock  And My Name is Earl  Calls NBC's  Programming department  Were not returned  As of press time  So that's going on  Today  That's  They're saying  There's no end  In sight for this  Strike  No  There's too many issues  And so what are  They going to do  Move on  I don't know  That's all we know  Right now  It's a good time  To go to NBC  And pitch my show  About a guy  Who doesn't write  At all  There you go  It's a show  With no writers  That's right  No writers  It's just me  Talking on camera  For 22 minutes 
[01:35:00]  That counts for  Commercials  Of course  Just Jimmy's  Babbling  With no self editing  Babble babble  Babble babble  All I do is  Like show products  Like whatever  I should do some research  And see whatever  Their products are  And just say  All I do is  Talk about how  Good pampers are  Wow this guy's good  Let's hire him  There's uh  Would you wear a suit  Would you sit behind a desk  I'd wear a tampon  On my face  Just to get on NBC  Of course  So you can babble  Uh let's say hi  To Steve  If they asked me  To guest host  The Tonight Show 
[01:35:30]  I would squeeze  Leno out in a second  I would take that job  In a second  Steve what's up  What's up bro  Hey  Hey  Listen I'm a teamster  Okay  And the reason  Yeah the reason  Why they have  That big rat  Is cause those guys  Who are working  At that specific project  Are non-union  The undercarriage  Of the rat  Yeah  It's like  It's like  The rat  Is representing  The president  Of that corporation  That's non-union  Yep  And you have the managers  And everybody else  Those are the little  Baby rats 
[01:36:00]  That are suckling off  The president  Oh god bless  The teamsters  I like the fact  Hold on  I didn't know  What the undercarriage  Was the pink  Little cute little belly  With the little  Little uh  You know  You can't say it  But yeah  You know  The feeders  The feeders  The little feeders  For the little rats  It's just awful  But it's funny  That the guy's like  No well the rats  Is a bad thing  Cause like rats  Are no good  Rats are you know  Bad  No I  Very good  We understand  We understand  The whole rat  We didn't understand  The undercarriage  Because they went  Out of their way 
[01:36:30]  To make sure  You see the pink belly  With all the little feeders  Yeah  That are sticking out  Okay now we know  We're gonna blow a rat up  In Yonkers  Huh  We're gonna go blow  Another rat up  In Yonkers  Oh really  You got  Yeah  Got some problems over there  Yeah we got a little bit  Of a thing going  I gotta tell you man  Times have changed  For the teamsters  It used to be  They would blow something up  Now they just gotta blow up  An inflatable rat  Do you guys have  More than one rat  Yeah exactly  Yeah  Of course they do  They got a whole warehouse  But who's the guy  That makes them  You know there's a guy 
[01:37:00]  That he owns like  Ted's  Ted's inflatable rat factory  And he was going broke  And then a teamster  Showed up and goes  We could use 5,000  We need a bunch of rats  What happens if the  Rat factory  Goes on strike  When they do  Big piece of cheese  Out in front  Or a big foot  With a rat's head under it  Yeah  Alright sir  Thank you  Alright bro  Alright there goes Steve  Has anybody  Oh we should have asked Steve  Has anybody ever popped one  Like you wonder  Like some business owner  Ever freaked out  You probably wouldn't 
[01:37:30]  Want to stab it  Who would have  Go out there with  Yeah  Who would have the balls  To mess with those people  You just deal with  The inflatable rat  Outside your business  And hope they go away  Ugh  Because you would be insane  To pop that thing  Nothing better than  Watching that old footage  Of the old strikes  Old dock strikes  Where they're just  Coming at each other  With baseball bats  And pipes  Sure  The good old days  And let's say  Hi to Zimmer in Vegas  Now they put balloons  In front of the establishment 
[01:38:00]  Zimmer what's up  Morning fellas  Hey  Alright the PESA West  Are on a mission  To throw up another banner  For the OJ trial  Yeah the PESA West  Were very successful  With their Tyra banner  Good  Calling her  A fatty pig fatty  Fatty pig fatty  After she tried to go on  And say that she didn't  Gain weight  When we all saw that  Weird swimsuit photo  Of hers  Yep  And the POWs  Actually got this  Amazing professional banner  Right outside her studio  Where she does her show  Well she's since 
[01:38:30]  Have moved to New York  She wanted to get away  From you guys I guess  But you're trying to do  Something with the OJ trial  Right we're trying to get  Trying to get a catchphrase  Maybe a little idea  From you guys  Alright  Scratched off three  Keep listening to the show  We'll come up with  Some catchphrases  Like we were going to start  Like OJ's sparkling wiggle  But I mean  That might be a little hacky  Right right right  No one would get it  It has to be something  That the press would get  Right and something  That they won't block out 
[01:39:00]  Either  Right well the Tyra thing  I mean you guys got  A lot of coverage for that  If you remember  The Daily Ten did something  And a few of the other  Entertainment sites  Did some stuff on that  So good luck to you guys  Alright well yeah  Definitely we're  We're looking for ideas  From you fellas  Okay  Alright  Thank you Zimmer  You got it brother  Alright let's say hi  To Lead Belly in Boston  Lead Belly  O.B. what's going on  Hey bro  I got a question  Do you guys know  What Tracy Morgan's going to do  Now that 30 Rock got cancelled  Yeah knowing him

[01:40:00]  In front of the O.J. thing  Okay  The Opie and Anthony show  Dash  We don't kill our wives  Exclamation point  Ooh  That's good  Because he did  Yes  No one here has  I think Blue Heeler  From Kentucky nailed it  O.J.  With that dot dot  Like the dot  Colon  Yeah I like to say the dot  And then a dot below it  Uh huh  O.J. dot  And then dot below it  This time the club fits 
[01:40:30]  Huh  There's no Opie and Anthony  Show that thing  Yeah  I was just kind of being  Self promoting  Just trying to include  The program  They'll have the Opie and Anthony  On the top  Oh  That's how they do with Tyra  Just Opie and Anthony  On the top  And then O.J.  Uh colon  This time the club fits  I think you got it there  Uh P.O.W.  You don't have to overthink it  Uh so there you go  Um  Drudge Report reporting  NBC has canceled  The Office 30 rocket  My name is Errol  Due to the writer's strike  Uh in other news  What do we got  We got the John Cena thing 
[01:41:00]  Hey Zoom  Oh yeah  What was that a good explanation  Huh  That was a very believable  Explanation he gave  The John Cena thing  Excellent  It's a little weird  We could get to that  Excellent  Also speaking of the Drudge Report  They're reporting that  This is  This sounds completely insane  We probably need  A little more info on this  But uh  The Drudge Report is reporting  That MIT researchers  Will announce  Shocking new information  About the life expectancy  Of the sun  Later today  We've been talking about  Global warming on this show 
[01:41:30]  And going green  And all that right  Yeah  Yeah  New data reveals  That previous estimates  Of the sun's decay  Are grossly inaccurate  And that it could burn out  In less than 200 years  200  Get out of here  This is a major  And shocking discovery  Says senior research engineer  Alan Lazarus  The rate of nuclear fusion  Is drastically greater  Than all previous estimates  The sun is consuming  More fuel than it is producing  And has been doing so  For the past 1.3  Billion years 
[01:42:00]  Billion  Lazarus says that  The continuing deterioration  Of the Earth's ozone layer  Has provided scientists  With increasingly accurate  Measurements of the sun's  Composition and burn rate  Hmm  Lazarus sounds fun  Alan Lazarus  He's a fun guy  To hang out with  Do you know how many people  He's probably told that to  They're just like  Shut up Alan  So  Creeping us out  200 years  And the sun burns up 
[01:42:30]  Well let me see  So  This is pretty much  The bottom line here  So we're okay  Our kids will be okay  Their kids will be okay  No no not necessarily  No way  And then it gets a little creepy  Your kids  Like you're  No no no  You have your kids  Say they look to be  Another 70 years  Right  Oh yeah maybe  Okay  Drudge report reporting  That MIT researchers  Announcing shocking new information  About the life expectancy  Of the sun later today  New data reveals  The previous estimates  Of the sun's decay  Are grossly inaccurate 
[01:43:00]  And that it will burn out  Or could burn out  In less than 200 years  I need more info on that  Well that changes things  Not for me it doesn't  How does it change  How does it change things for you?  No not for me  Like for people that  Are planning  If we had  Ahead for  I don't know  Like  Putting  Making the air cleaner  Things like that  If we had a  Making factories  More compliant  To the environment  That's kind of a 
[01:43:30]  Go for broke thing now  If we had a  If we had a  Your way  On your deathbed  You'd blow out the sun  Wouldn't care  That's what I'm saying  So why does this  Bother you at all?  You don't care  What happens after  It's a little creepy  After your life  Life is over  Because you know  If you expected  Or you picture the sun  Burning out  You kind of always  Picture the earth  Being so far in the future  That you wouldn't even  Have a concept of it  Right  But a couple hundred years 
[01:44:00]  You know  Things aren't going to be  Much different  And you could  Kind of picture  You know  What people would  Do or feel like  Or be like  When that happens  This is really creeping me out  That is kind of creepy  This is creepy  Creeping me out  Because I'll tell you something  When you're a little kid  And you find out  For the first time  You know  You're going to die someday  It's the creepiest feeling ever  I can't think of a creepier feeling  Than finding that out  For the first time  Finding out that you're going to die  For the first time  It's got to be the worst 
[01:44:30]  Human experience possible  That was very creepy  But then I had some  And then I would try  To put my arms around  The whole thing  Is something creepier?  Of course  Finding out that certain things  Hurt  Finding out that  Sleeping on your stomach  Is not always a wise idea  Quite a few creepier things  Actually  And then  And then  After I  I sort of got my arms 
[01:45:00]  Around that  Then I  I worked it out  In my head this way  It's like  Alright so I'm going to die someday  But I  I took some solace  In the fact that  Well life will go on  For a really long time  After I'm dead  You like that part?  Why that would  Would help out  The fact that  You're going to die someday  I don't know  But in my head  It kind of worked  Because I  I was thinking  Death  Awful  Dark  Maybe after life  Who knows  But like  No sun  And everyone dead  For billions of years  Really creepy  Cold  Planet  Just really creepy 
[01:45:30]  No atmosphere  Nice  Nice  So we'll find out  More about that  But MIT scientists  With the doozy today  According to the Drudge Report  Let's say  And the beauty of this show  Excuse me  Who's this tranny actress?  What are you talking about?  Transgendered actress  And her twin brother  Not the  Good Morning America  That's a guy?  I don't know  She's fantastic  If she is  It validates everything  I've always said  Nah that's a guy  That's a guy  Come on 
[01:46:00]  It can't be  Look  Adam's apple  You could say now  But there's no way  You'd see that  Absolutely  I would know  That's a guy  Oh I wouldn't  I can point out  Trannies in a second  Where were you  When I needed your  There's no way  That's gotta be  Look at that huge man  We're talking about  Good Morning America  It's from confusion  Give me the voice  There's a beautiful blonde  Beautiful blonde girl  Beautiful blonde girl  It's a man in a wig  No it's not  Take away the hair  Take away the hair  It's gotta be the tranny 
[01:46:30]  Oh my god  Are you kidding me  What she's from  Dirty sexy money  On ABC  Is she a post-op tranny  She's a he  Yeah  Of course it is  I'm telling you  That's a good one  Look  Ed if you didn't see  The caption  You wouldn't just say  Of course that is  I would  Look at the Adam's apple  I'm bobbing up and down  No because  I'd have to hear the voice  But just seeing the video  No no look  It's pointy  Look at the size of that thing  Well yeah well  We know though  Only cause we know 
[01:47:00]  Right if you just saw that face  Dan you'd be fooled  I absolutely would  Don't make us play  The fool you game again  There ain't no fool you game  I ain't losing  We're gonna play the fool you game  That is a big guy  Right after our taser  Panty party  We're gonna have a  Fool you game  A fool you game  I would never know that  I'm not pulling the curly  Wool over my eyes  No way  I wanna know if that's  A post-op or pre-op  Alright  Bob in Verona  What's up?  Hey guys 
[01:47:30]  How you doing?  Or is it Verona?  Uh  Verona, New Jersey  Okay  They said  Verona on the screen  Go ahead  What do you got?  Those shows that were  Canceled on NBC  Are they cancelled  For the duration of the strike  Or just cancelled?  According to what we just read  From the Drudge Award  Canceled  That's it  That's unbelievable  That is it  They're making a statement  I've ripped it up  I ripped up the news story  Hollywood writer's strike  Enters its second week  NBC has announced  That it has cancelled  Three of its top rated sitcoms  The Drudge Report  Is reporting that NBC  Has cancelled 
[01:48:00]  The Office 30 Rock  And My Name is Earl  Sources tell Drudge  That the cancellations  Are a result  Of the growing rift  Between NBC  And Steve Carell  Tina Fey  And Jason Lee  The head writers  Slash actors  Of these three shows  There you go  They're playing hardball  Thank you Bob  Damn  Let's go to Chris  The Trucker  Chris what's up?  Hey I had a question  About the sun  Yeah  The big yellow one  Is the sun  What?  I want to know 
[01:48:30]  If it's going to turn out  Like a light bulb  Or is it going to  Slowly fade over the years  Well I don't know  We got like a light bulb  It's burning  There's going to be  More info later today  According to Drudge Report  I would think  And you know  What do I know  That if it's burning fuel  At a rate higher  Than they thought it was  And higher than  It can reproduce it  That it would just  Kind of slowly burn out  As it runs out of fuel  Instead of just 
[01:49:00]  You know  Click all of a sudden  Hey it's light out  Hey it's dark  So it would be  Kind of slow  And when do we  Start seeing it  If it's 200 years  Do we start seeing  Like in 100 years  Do you start noticing  Hey it's kind of  You know  Getting dimmer  And colder  More info later today  According to the Drudge Report  I bet one day  Everybody just gets up  And goes  Wow it's really dark  For four in the afternoon  And then it's done  We all freeze to death  Over  What happened  That was today  How long do you think 
[01:49:30]  People would last  Without the sun  How long would people  Last without  The sun at all  I always assumed  That you would just  Freeze instantly  Instantly  Is it something  That would take a couple days  Well that's what I mean  Is it a few hours  It is a few days  Months  At least eight minutes  Can you hang out  Like dressed up  With a generator going  And  Yeah you know  Some heat  I don't know  But the plants would all die  So I imagine  Your oxygen supply  Would go  Relatively quickly  And  Yeah once the plants go 
[01:50:00]  Then there's a big problem  So you think  There's enough heat  But that would  You think there's enough  Heat in the area  To just kind of  Keep things going for a while  A few days maybe  What if you made  Like a giant  Like a greenhouse  And put  Plants in there  And then a bunch of lights  Over it  Well we better start  Working on this  And then you could  You could like  Have little pockets  Of where you could live  On the earth  With heat and light  No  No  No 
[01:50:30]  You're talking about  The sun  This is not  What if  What if  That thing we made  Breaks down  This is the sun  How about if you put  A little greenhouse  With plants  Good you could die in there  Like everybody else  You and your dumb  Greenhouse plants  I was just thinking  It would make some oxygen  And then  Maybe it would  Does it make you  Hug your azalea  As you both just  Drop dead together  Does it make you  Live your life differently  Knowing it's 
[01:51:00]  Possibly less than  200 years  Instead of  You know  A billion  Or whatever it would be  I'll be on Craigslist later  See if there's any  Any suns burning out  Hooker discounts  And what was the  What was the fun fact  About the sun  That we wouldn't even know  That it went out  Until what  Eight minutes  Was it eight minutes  Oh that's why you said  Eight minutes  Jimmy  Okay  You were lingering longer  I do so many  Are you a fan  Of linger longer  Well no  I'm a fan of space travel  Say it  It does feel good 
[01:51:30]  Coming out  I'm a fan of  Traveling at the speed  Of light  As we all know  I've said that many times  There's two things I like  It's prostitutes  And traveling quickly  We did have a fun fact  And this is creepy  A creepy way to live your life  That someone called in  And said that  If the sun was to go out  You wouldn't know  Until eight minutes later  Yeah  So every eight minutes  You're sitting there like  Oh no  It could be out  It could just be out  Right now  Well we see things  That's what the Hubble  Was built to see  The beginning of time  Yeah  When you see a lot 
[01:52:00]  Of this stuff  That you're seeing  Distant galaxies  You're seeing  It as it  Like it's reaching you now  But a lot of the things  You're seeing  Have already burned out  They're gone  Yeah  So technically  You're seeing it  Into the past  So I'm going to suggest  That it will gradually  Get colder  If the sun goes out  Hey uh  Wait hold on  I'm sorry  Let me just continue  With what I was saying  Because  But there's really  A thin veil  Could I give you  That impression  Jimmy  I'm sorry  No you didn't  I'm just picturing  Poor people driving to work  Just zing out  And hitting the wall  The big yellow one's  The sun  That's right 
[01:52:30]  So the sun right  Yeah  Imagine the sun  Is a bonfire  Uh huh  I thought this once  Under  Well  I don't smoke pot  Under some weed  No I don't smoke pot  And uh  So  And  And let's say  The earth  Is your  Is your marshmallow  Okay  Why isn't the earth  Like burning  Like a marshmallow  Right now  Because of the rotation  We're the perfect  Distance away  Alright so  Perfect rotation  Alright 
[01:53:00]  You're going to get a mile  Away from a bonfire  With a marshmallow  It won't burn  Alright I'm with you though  So let's get the perfect  Distance away from the fire  With a marshmallow  You're trying to tell me  It will never tan  Uh  I guess not  No we're kind of  We're tan  Unless the bonfire  Gets bigger  Which is what speculation  Has also been  That people  For a long time  So the sun  Would just kind of grow  And envelop  Mercury Venus  Yeah  And the earth  Well and also  I guess some areas  Do tan  If you think of like  Dried up 
[01:53:30]  Lake beds and stuff  And burnt  That's the marshmallow  That's the marshmallow  Tanning  Yeah  That's the marshmallow  Burning  I'm going to  I'm going to teach  My kids great stuff  In very simple ways  Okay  Very simple  Let me explain the sun  See this bonfire  Okay grab a marshmallow  That's the earth  Now spin it around  Keep spinning it  Keep spinning it  Keep spinning it  Keep spinning it  Now eat it  I'm going to teach my kids  Don't look at the sun  It'll make you queer  Just to watch my son  Walk with his head down  For the  Thank God 
[01:54:00]  We can still say queer  On the radio  Can you  Who knows  It means odd  Yes it does  Alright  Well I don't need to know  Any more about this  Something  Jeff  Jeff in Jersey  What's up  How's it going man  Welcome aboard Jeff  Yes  The sun will implode  When it runs out of fuel  I don't think it will  No implode  It's not big enough  To implode  I don't think  Am I incorrect  It turned into black holes  Right  No no no  That's  Sorry you need a sun  Planned probably a thousand times 
[01:54:30]  The mass of the sun  Our sun would probably  I was always speculating  That it would kind of  Just go out  Expand  And then  Just shrink  It's not big enough  To implode  To make a black hole  You silly goose  Yeah  First you have neutron stars  Big stars implode  To make neutron stars  And bigger ones than that  That are heavier  They make black holes  How many times  Do we have to go over this  You've been talking  To Dr. Cuckold  No Dr. Cuckold  Oh okay  I thought he was a guy  That studied science  And watched his loved ones 
[01:55:00]  Having sex with people  Do you know how many women  I've dried up  Talking about space  Alright well  Jeff we'll find out  More later  But according to  The Drudge Report  Once again  The reporting  That MIT researchers  Will announce  Shocking new info  About the life expectancy  Of the sun later today  New data reveals  The previous estimate  Of the sun's decay  Are grossly inaccurate  And that it'll burn out  In less than 200 years  According to what  Alan Lazarus  Lazarus  Lazarus 
[01:55:30]  Lazarus sorry  And this is a major  And shocking discovery  The rate of nuclear fusion  Is drastically  Greater than all  Previous estimates  I don't know what  The hell that means  The sun is consuming  More fuel than it's producing  And has been doing so  For the past  1.3 billion years  How the hell  Did they figure this crap out  Lazarus says that  The continuing deterioration  Of the earth's ozone layer  Has provided scientists  With increasingly accurate  Measurements of the sun's  Composition  And burn rate  So I guess we'll find out  Later today  According to the Drudge Report  We're going to take a break 
[01:56:00]  We'll certainly move on  To the John Cena thing  Which is a little weird today  And we got a man calling  911 for beer  And we got a grandma  Being strip searched  Did we do the beer thing yet  Or no?  I don't think we did  I don't think so  Oh we didn't  Okay maybe we just  We're talking about it  We're trying to develop  A new bit  And we're almost there  Like the man on the street  The local residents  Having to comment about  Stories happening in their area  You got to give the local angle  And of course  The local residents  Are always going to be 
[01:56:30]  You know  Not approving  Of what's going on  In their neighborhood  Oh it's terrible  I can't believe it  I don't believe it's happening here  But it's such a quiet neighborhood  It's something the news does  And they go  Well we talked to local residents  About this horrific murder  That happened  Oh it's just that  Of course it's a terrible thing  Such a quiet neighborhood  Things like that never happen here  Well man it's a double homicide rape  Of course they don't happen  They don't normally happen everywhere  No one would move there  Right 
[01:57:00]  Right  What do you think  That's on the sign  You're right  Yeah  Welcome to Youngstown  Where double homicide and rape  Are a daily happening  Just once  I want some neighbor to go  You know  Well good  Because I thought he was a kid toucher  Yeah  Somebody be on to him  Right  But no it's always  It's terrible  I can't believe it happened  In this neighborhood  Blah blah blah  Blah blah  Blah blah  We talked to local residents  And they all laughed in our faces  When we told them  I'm glad he burned  That guy was irritating  A fire that just slowly 
[01:57:30]  Baked his head  Oh that's terrific  Let's go to John in Jersey  John what's up  Well I'd just like to bring your attention  That the reason  The earth doesn't  You know  Just burst into flames  Like a giant marshmallow  Because it's made out of rock  And marshmallows  Are made out of sugar  Alright man  That's a good point  Why do you have to blow up my spot  Rock and sugar  Well rock will burn  Eventually  Thanks for blowing up my spot  Now how am I going to

[02:00:00]  On meth  On  On crack  On meth isn't bad though  Because meth is such an  Ugly teeth grinding drug  Not that crack isn't  Crack is kind of 80s  But like the meth  When you're on meth man  You're like cooking it up  In a tub  You're just  Cooking it up  Just wanting to  And it just makes you  Want to kill people  Yeah  Like in a worse way  Like choke them  Physically  Not use a gun  Or anything  You have to rip people apart  With your bare hands 
[02:00:30]  When you're on meth  You know what's great about  You know what's great about  Meth you actually have to  Search out a basin  How do you do meth  Do you smoke it  I don't even know how you do it  Meth  I don't know  Meth is smoked  Oh  Much like  Crack  Or freebase  And it tastes like plastic  You should put it in  Shoofly pie  And feed it to the Amish  And watch them  Bite their horses faces  Build a barn  In 3 minutes  52 seconds  An Amish meth lab  Yeah  And then burn it down 
[02:01:00]  On the same weekend  Dumb meth heads  Kill all their relatives  Alright listen  We gotta move on  So we got  Oh  Listen to this  Growing up  Me and my brother  We were kind of  Exact opposites  As you can imagine  So we  It was kind of funny  We were completely  Yin and yang  He was more rough  And tumble  And I just wanted to  You know  Play with my girlfriend  Shop your penis off  That was the tranny  Yeah  He was more rough  And tumble 
[02:01:30]  Can you hear it  In her voice though  Yes  Absolutely  I think we fooled  Some people out there  I bet you they  Were thinking  Oh my god  That's a chick  That to me  Sounds  Let me hear  Let me hear it again  You know  It sounds like  That Michaela girl  That Kate Christian  Addresses to  That's who  That reminded me of  Girl  Right  Girl  Thing  Guy  All right  Let's go to  Brooklyn Ace  Brooklyn Ace  What's up  Hey guys  I just got up  A couple of minutes ago  They're reporting  On the news  That several of the 
[02:02:00]  TV shows that are on  Are going to be cancelled  Because of Raiders Strike  Actually it's NBC  Cancelling  What were they  30 Rock  The Office  And My Name Is Earl  Oh  I've got to watch it  But FM  So I forgot that  Yeah  I guess that's what  Is being reported  By the Drudge Report  And I guess some news outlets  Now too  As long as they don't  Cancel Taxi on DVD  I don't watch anything  That's on television  I just want to watch  Lost  Don't cancel MASH  Oh uh Jim  Got some bad news  John Cena or Grandma 
[02:02:30]  Being strip searched  We still got show to do  The John Cena thing  John Cena  Strip searching Grandma  I like that  John Cena  Combine the stories  Angrily  Who by the way  Has been on our show  A few times  He's a great guy  Really great guy  Very entertaining guy  Very funny guy  He was on CNN  And they did a whole  I guess show on steroids  And stuff  Because of Chris Benoit  And all that  What happened?  And  And they made it sound like  Cena  Did steroids  And CNN got caught 
[02:03:00]  With their  Pants down  Because there's some  Raw video that has surfaced  That proves that they  Edited what Cena was saying  To make it  Look like he  Admitted to doing steroids  Oh  Or  Or  Kind of like  Was beating around the bush  When the question was asked  Here's what CNN  Aired  John Cena  Is a WWE superstar  Now recovering from an injury  In the ring  He doesn't like being asked 
[02:03:30]  If he has used steroids  This is a crazy question  And it's something that  It's tough to answer  Just because of the way  Society is now  I can't tell you that I haven't  But you'll never be able  To prove that I have  What does that mean?  It sounds like he's  Doing steroids  In that last part  Although in any  Absolutely  In any context  That's a crazy question  I don't think so  Did you do steroids?  Whoa  Back up  How could you say that?  Look at him  I know  It looks like he does steroids  He wrestled 
[02:04:00]  Basically he was trying to say  Look  You know  I can't  I can't say that I didn't  But you'll never prove  That I did  Right?  That's what you get from that?  Yeah  Well here's the raw video  Of that same interview  Have you ever used steroids?  Absolutely not  Wait a minute  What?  That's it?  Absolutely not  Absolutely not  Have you ever used steroids?  Absolutely not  And this is a  Even back in bodybuilding days  This is a  Football days 
[02:04:30]  This is a crazy question  And that's what  They picked up  They cut out the part  Where he said  Absolutely not  And then when  His answer started with  This is a crazy question  And do you hear the reporter  This is why I despise reporters  When she said to him  Even though he's probably lying  I mean I assume he is  That's my opinion  I think he's lying  Anyone that big  Has to have used steroids  But  When she said to him  Have you ever used steroids?  And he said  Absolutely not  Then she kind of like  Tags it with  Football days  Like you go  Oh oh  I didn't realize  It ever covered that  Oh right  Steroids  Doesn't ever cover 
[02:05:00]  Your entire life  Oh okay  Ever  By the way Jimmy  You just insulted me  Why?  Then how did I get  You're different though  Dude you don't count  Look how big I am  And I never did  Hurry look  Before they  I'm not looking  You're no anomaly  The difference is  You're more of a specimen  And that's common knowledge  A guy like Cine  Probably wasn't meant  To be that big  You're just what we call  Gifted  And you're more sculpted  That's why you have  That little V thing  Going into your jeans  I should get on the juice  Yeah I should  Get on the juice  I'd love it if your head  Just swelled up like  Jerry Lewis  It did nothing for your arms 
[02:05:30]  Just a big John Edwards head  And Ann I hate to tell you  But you're already on the juice  I'm on the juice  I mean you listen to the Monday shows  And you're escapades from the weekend  You're on the juice  Don't worry about it  I like Bud Light  It's a different type of juice  But you're on the juice  I like Bud Light  Alright  Do you want to hear the rest of it  But then they pick up from where  They edited it  Have you ever used steroids  Absolutely not  And this is a  Even back in bodybuilding days 
[02:06:00]  Football days  This is a crazy question  My answer to that question  Have you ever used steroids  Is the only thing I can say  I can't tell you that I haven't  But you'll never be able to prove that I have  Because each one of you  Each one of you out there  Has an opinion  On how I carry myself  And I can take a million tests  I've been tested for drugs  Since I've been 17 years old  I can take a million tests  I can pass every one of them  As soon as I pass it  There's some other guy  On the other end going  Oh there's masking agents  To this, there's that  I know the arguments 
[02:06:30]  Because I've been in the situation  He was trying to explain  Like what the media does  With steroids  Which kind of confuses  His answer a little bit  But the fact remains  That CNN took out the part  Where he said  Absolutely not  And now I'm going to  Try to explain this whole  Sterroid thing  That you people do  Part where he kind of  Sounds like he's  Covering it up  Right, right  But he did say  I can't tell you that I haven't  If you haven't  You can tell people you haven't  I think he was saying  Like look  I can't tell you anything  Oh okay  I can't tell the part  Right, yeah  That's kind of how I took it 
[02:07:00]  Listen to it now  It sounds like he says  Look I can't tell you I haven't  Because you don't want to listen  I see  And then they think they got gold  All we have to do is take out the part  Where he goes  Absolutely not  Absolutely not  That's basically saying  Look, I don't do steroids  But it doesn't matter what I say  Because you guys are not going to believe me  Right  God, CNN did this  Can you imagine what else  They're freaking editing?  No  I can't  Let me think  Too busy mixing Wolf Blitzer's  Background music 
[02:07:30]  For his unwatchable show  The situation room  The situation room  More screens  With stupid Wolf standing there  Like he's just a man  Getting things done  With an older gentleman  In a creepy beard  With club music underneath  And let's not forget his three head  How low is his freaking hairline?  Like a wolf  Yeah, I get it  I call him Wolf  He stinks  I hate Wolf Blitzer  I don't really have an opinion on him  Other than the fact that if he died  It would kind of make me happy  But not because I hate him  It would just be kind of funny  There's a cold front  You know 
[02:08:00]  I'm heading toward the east coast  So let's get into the situation room  Situation room  They're not situations anymore  Which screen?  They're just basic little things  Which screen is it on?  It's a tornado on one screen  No  I'm looking at a flood  No, but it's not  And I'm looking at  It's a warehouse fire  Also it's a situation  It's uh  I don't know  I'm just talking about the beginning  The opening  Oh, high tide in Florida  He makes it sound like  There's a big deal going on  And then you realize  Meh  There's nothing going on  That warrants 18 big screens 
[02:08:30]  What the hell is he going to put on there?  Is this the music he has with?  Yeah  Oh, yeah  Because you're in the situation room  It's a situation  What is that?  It's a situation, Jimmy  Jimmy  I don't know  Do we get help  Or do we dance, Wolf?  What are you doing?  You're a journalist  No, he's not  But I'm saying that  You might have started as a journalist  What is this?  I want to see Wolf dance  This sucks  It's dramatic 
[02:09:00]  Alright, let's see what happened to Grandma  Oh, is he an idiot  Grandma was at a casino  And this is what happened  She gambled and won  But she says she lost her dignity  In the process  Oops  What game is that?  For allegedly being strip searched  At the Yonkers Raceway Casino  65-year-old Myrna Jones  Says she is appalled  At the way she was treated  And I just felt humiliated  You know, uh  Embarrassed  That's a woman?  I don't know  Sounds like Tippi Tom  I felt, uh  Humiliated 
[02:09:30]  I hope anyone strip searches me at 65  Who the hell is strip searching this  I'll tell you what happened  What happened?  She  They thought she was doing something wrong  Like she was smuggling, uh  Uh, uh  Chips or something  Because she sneezed  And her pantyhose filled up with coins  We got a winner  Jones says she was playing  One dollar slot machines  And one eighty dollars  But the machine did not spit out a paper winner slip  So she called security 
[02:10:00]  And they called a mechanic to open the machine  Meanwhile, she says she was taken to a room  And interrogated by a man  Whom she says turned out to be a plainclothes state trooper  Who then accused her of hiding the winning slip  In an apparent scam to get another  He said  You  We  On the camera  It showed that  You put the ticket in your bra  I said no  I said if you've seen me on camera  You've seen me take out a dollar  Put it in the machine  I'm playing two machines  Alright, a little taste of reality here 
[02:10:30]  You'd think this guy wanted to strip search you  Grandma  Yeah  Just doing his job  If he was a hot nineteen year old  With a little belly shirt and stuff  Then there would be a problem  This guy's like  Oh my god  I can't believe I have to freaking do this  He didn't want to do that  So what did the strip search entail?  But since a first look at the machine  Did not turn up the ticket  She says she was ordered into a room  Where a security woman conducted a strip search  I pulled off the sweater 
[02:11:00]  I unhooked my bra  And she told me to pull up my shirt  They kept me down there for almost two and a half hours  Then they came and they said they found the ticket  I said well where was the ticket?  He said it was in the machine  Jones is seeking an undetermined amount of damages  Saying she was humiliated  And wants to prevent it from happening to anyone else  Yeah well the search  The search E was also humiliated  The searcher  The searcher  Excuse me  The searcher  I agree with Joan on this one  Oh wow  Absolutely  Absolutely 
[02:11:30]  For a casino to strip search you for a ticket  When they misread a camera  I absolutely agree with her  That is a little extreme  Especially for the amount  How much was it?  80 bucks  Oh $80  I thought it was a million dollar ticket  Alright I'm with you guys too  Yeah she should  80 bucks  Jesus  A Yonkers casino  The old dummy habit  See how I swim walked backwards out of that one  Whoa  And saved myself  Who knew  I thought it was a million dollar ticket  Jimmy  Of course they shouldn't have strip searched it for $80  Who knew there's a casino in Yonkers?  I know  Yeah there's a 
[02:12:00]  It's at the raceway  It's not like a  They don't have table games or anything  They just have slot machines  And video poker  Oof  And of course the ponies  They want to bet on that  Do people vacation to Yonkers to gamble?

[02:15:00]  Here we are at XM Satellite Radio  Freedom  Hello  I gotta be honest  Jimmy  Being honest  That's something I usually say  It's my crutch world  I understand certain dumps  But Eric just came to me  They dumped out of  When a caller called  And said  Jim I IM'd you at Yellow Treats  They dumped out of Yellow Treats  I invented Yellow Treats 
[02:15:30]  Yes you did  It's not real  It is mind boggling  Join the club  Because back in the day  We came up with  The word kunk  Yeah  To mean oh yeah  To mean the C word  They started dumping out of that  They actually had an argument  With lawyers  That's gonna make a great book someday  It's not a real word  The arguments with lawyers  Book  And then we're like  Look you're dumping out of a word  That we made up  It's not even in the dictionary  It's uh 
[02:16:00]  It's fucking  Mind boggling  I can get certain dumps  Dude  I get it  You don't want an FCC fine  Yeah  Yellow Treats  Yeah you got  Is not  A finable offense  As  Because it doesn't exist  It's lemonade  Why are they cracking down  Like so much  Because they  I don't know  Maybe we could have that meeting  That goes nowhere  Anyway listen  Well  Yellow Treats  Jimmy  You were a bad boy today  I was a bad boy today 
[02:16:30]  Jimmy was a bad boy again  And Anthony of course  Perfect once again  I get a star  They dumped me saying  Yellow Treats  Oh doesn't want to rock the boat  Perfect again  There we go  That's right  Yellow Discipline  Keep the cash coming in  Yellow Discipline  They will dump too  I was told  Because that's another  Made up thing  You lost to  Yellow Treats today  I lost  Turd Cutter  Yeah  I didn't think  Turd Cutter  Was gonna go through  I know 
[02:17:00]  And I lost  Fag  Shit Cutter  You should have used  And you lost  Fag Trivia twice  But Fag Trivia  I wasn't  You see  Okay let's  Let's get the dump rules straight  I was told  And Tom kind of said this  On the air  That in certain context  Faggot's okay  He did say that  Like oh come on  Don't be a faggot  Let's go out of the movies  No no no  The context  That it's okay  Is off the air  That's the context  But no but he did say  In certain context  Tonight  He showed the F word  He goes well in certain context  It's allowed  In certain it's not 
[02:17:30]  You can play the audio back  He did say that  Yes  And the context  I used it  Which was Fag Trivia  Had nothing to do  With sexual orientation  And I understand  Givens is just  Trying to do his job  But it's like  Oh no no no  It came down from the top  That they're dumping out  So it's not even him  Taking a mistake  Well no no  Tom was in the studio  With us when I said that  Oh the fag one  Yeah  Oh okay  So what I'm saying  Is that was not  Tom had just said  In certain contexts  It's okay  And I said Fag Trivia 
[02:18:00]  Why wouldn't that be okay  And then Tom even said  About a bundle of sticks  There was nothing  About sexual orientation  What the fuck  Is happening  How is a company  So PC  It's getting bizarre  It's PC  Yeah  How do you  We're fucking guys  No we're not  It's fucking politically  What are you doing  You didn't get the memo  You have to come to work  And you have to tuck it  Before you go to work  Yeah do the duct tape  We're talking at this point  It's not about FCC  Fine  What the fuck 
[02:18:30]  Yeah  I know that's not  A very articulate argument  Well that's what  But god almighty  Is that aggravating  I agree with it though  You can't just be  A fucking guy  What do you agree with that  And compete like  A fucking guy  Against other guys  I agree with the fuck  When you're being dumb  Saying fag  Or douchebag  I'll put the bag  At the end of that  You gotta  Uh oh  You're acting like  A real hiney  Hey I'm between  The ages of 18 and 24  I gotta hear these guys  They're rebellious  These guys are crazy 
[02:19:00]  Now we're gonna get  They had a bunch of people  Do a bake off  In the studio  It was out of control  They couldn't eat it though  You know  Peanut allergies  It was nuts  Wow these guys are terrific  I like edgy morning radio  These guys are edgy  They actually said  Bulbalicious  To describe a gal  I couldn't get over it  Holy mackerel 
[02:19:30]  Am I enjoying  That radio program  They actually saw a girl  And they said  Hey honey  Nice touch  I couldn't believe  My ears  I'm like  Are they gonna get  In trouble for this  They have to  Fucking motherfucker  You know we're in  Trouble now right  For what  Cause now we're not  They're not happy  When we discuss  Our frustrations  Over here  It's legitimate  Now it's gotten 
[02:20:00]  To the point  Where we get in  Trouble for what  We say over here  I  I will say this  To anybody  There is nothing  Or finable  About those words  They're not being used  As hateful words  No  I will make this  Argument to anybody  So what are the  What are the reasons  Where's the reasoning  Behind it  If you could sit down  And say  Look  It's not finable  Which it isn't  It's not  And it's not  Offensive  To anybody's  Sexuality 
[02:20:30]  Race  Religion  Anything  Why then  Isn't it allowed  And the answer  Would be  Blah blah blah  Blah blah  Blah  Legalese  Blah blah blah  Here's the answer  If the answer  Was honest  And this is  A lot of corporations  Who say the same thing  This is not just about  CBS or NBC  This is  Honestly  Corporations  Think this way  It's about being  Politically correct  Because we don't  Want to offend anybody  Who will complain  To the advertisers  That is the reality  Of it  And I get that  On some level  But look at  South Park 
[02:21:00]  South Park  Is a great example  Of what happens  When you stand  By a show  That's the biggest  Thing Comedy Central  Has ever had  And they are  You cannot be edgier  On television  Than they are  Yeah  I mean  Fucking  Naggers  After the  Michael Richards  Thing  They did  An episode  Where naggers  And you're  The nigger guy  That was  Fucking brilliant  It was a  Brilliant parody  It was brilliant  And that's what  Happens when you  Stand by  A show like that 
[02:21:30]  People get it  Some people  Are offended  Of course  Of course  But when the  Network stood  By them  It's the biggest  Thing Comedy Central  Ever had  We should go  On strike  And just have  Like a picket  Outside the station  And with signs  And say  We won't go back  On the radio  Until we can say  Douchebag  Let's have  Douchebag  As our calling card  Douchebag  You believe  How funny would it be  Though if the media  Shows up like  They're actually  Striking  Because they want  To say  Douchebag 
[02:22:00]  On the radio  I'm amazed  That it's the  Bag part  That's what  Stuns me  Douche is okay  It's that  Bag part  It's amazing  And scum  Is okay  But it's scumbag  Because I'll tell you  What happened  Was some  Fucking low rent  Unfunny lawyer  Said that that's  A condom  And it's not  A condom  If you want to  Talk about how  Things are interpreted  Oh scumbag  Maybe in 1950  Make sure you  Wear a scumbag  Son  Not now 
[02:22:30]  Scumbag has turned  Into just being  A fucking  You're a scumbag  I don't mean to  Start the show  Yelling and screaming  On your side  I just  Hold on  With that said  This guy who  Didn't leave his name  Unfortunately  Because he did it  From a mobile device  He writes  We don't like  Angry Jimmy  We  Love him  I just found out  When I came back  Over here  That they dumped  Out of yellow  Treats  When a caller  Said it  And they also  Changed like  Like  Like  The negro  Was the sound clip  But they stopped 
[02:23:00]  Running the promos  On it  The negro  Yeah  Alright get a press  Release out  I don't fucking  Get it  Get a press release  Out to the  The media  That Opie Anthony  And little Jimmy  Norton  Are going on strike  Until they're allowed  To say douchebag  On regular radio  Let's get it going  Who's got the  Official press release  It's not even about  It's not even about  Motherfucking the company  It really isn't  It's just  Well  What do you  I'm not sure  What they expect you to do  Like it really is  Like what do you want  The show to do  What was scary today  Was that Tom said  He's sick of arguing  And I gotta say this 
[02:23:30]  And I do see it  Anthony's way actually  I will argue  Right to our last day  On regular radio  I will  But I will do it  In an intelligent way  And in a  What was the other word  I used  Articulate  Articulate  Civil  Civil  Mature  Mature  In adult fashion  And try not to get  My emotions involved  But we gotta like  Fight for our show  We gotta fight  For some of these things  And it does make for  It does make for  Compelling radio  For the people listening in  Because it is something  That is going on  Out there in media 
[02:24:00]  Like the whole landscape  Is changing drastically  And for some reason  Radio is being left behind  Like  Like  None of these rules  Are on  On regular radio  To this extent  TV is getting  On TV I meant  It's getting edgier  And edgier  And edgier  Because of things like  Rescue Me and cable  It's getting edgier  And edgier  And they say  Well that's on cable  But  Come on man  Who really knows  What stations are cable  That's not  How many people  How many people  Just have an antenna  Right  And get the old channels 
[02:24:30]  Anyway  Everyone gets the  Basic cable package  Which includes  Like FX  And things like that  So you know  That's just TV  These days  My challenge is gonna be  To keep my emotions  Out of it  And just try to  Like Jimmy had a  Brilliant argument  With Tracy  Who by the way  Because the stupid media  Is reporting that  We have this massive  Problem with Tracy  We had an issue  With Tracy  That kind of  Resolved itself  But the media  Does want to hear that  And I even sent out  A few emails  Like will you stop  Writing that 
[02:25:00]  There's a massive  Problem with Tracy  There isn't a  Massive problem anymore  There was  There was a  Pretty big flare up  That went away  And she's been  Coming in  To our show  On a regular basis  Since now  Since it got worked out  With that said  Jimmy had just  A great  Great  Discussion with her  About the homeless  Shopping spree  That was really  Interesting  And you  And you kind of  Like threw some  Some of that  Intelligence at her  The bottom line  And logic  And I'm not gonna  Yell at them  Because to me 
[02:25:30]  I have no desire  To yell at them  It's just a matter  Of I feel like  I'm arguing  From a point  Where it's right  I'm not coming out  Like some smarmy  Idiot trying to  Trying to squeeze  In the word cunt  Into a regular  Discussion  I'm coming from  A place that is right  The homeless  Shopping spree  I don't care how  Menino interpreted it  It's not an awful thing  We treat the homeless nice  The fucking fans  Cheer for the homeless people  Right  It's not some phony  Horseshit counting  Of the homeless  They're leaving  With clothing  Right  Yeah  And also  To allow Menino 
[02:26:00]  Or anybody to affect that  Is to me  It's kind of silly  And the new element  This year was gonna be  That we actually  Cause these guys  Come out of the woodwork  Kill them at the end  These guys  With fire and bricks  And we set the bus  On fire  And lock the doors  This fire was sponsored by  And we had the bus driver  Jump out at 40 miles an hour  Yeah  Go off an embankment  To make that more impressive  We were gonna throw in the element  Of like  You know  Raising money for an actual  Homeless charity  Because we see that  The fans come out  I mean  It's insane 
[02:26:30]  I said 2 or 3 thousand people  Went to the mall last year  They're saying it was  Way more than that  But let's just say  It was 3 thousand  Freaking fans  Showed up at the mall  You know  We would take up  A huge collection  For the homeless  So we would have that element  If they each gave  A million dollars  But they don't  That'd be a lot of money  But they don't wanna give up  They don't wanna  More than that  They don't wanna give up  Afternoon drive  Which would be like  3 to 7  In New York  So we could do it  Because we can't do it  During a morning show  Because the malls  Aren't really open  Except for like  Mall walkers 
[02:27:00]  And then we're like  Alright  You don't wanna do  An afternoon drive  Okay  Why don't we do it  Like we did last year  And we'll do  Weekend afternoon drive  And they said no  And I don't understand that  I've been doing this  A long time  And I know people  Get sick  When I say that  But it is the truth  I've been doing radio  Since I was 18  It defies logic  That you wouldn't want  Like your morning show  You know  Doing this  Homeless shopping spree  That gets a really  Really big amount  Of attention  From the local  TV stations  National TV stations 
[02:27:30]  You cause a controlled  Commotion  Which is  Thousands of people  Showing up at the mall  With their Opie and Anthony  Signs and stuff  That just helps market  The radio show  Yeah  And for some reason  They just don't see it  That way  They'd rather  Because they're trying  To establish K-Rock  Here in New York  As a rock station  And they don't want  To take away from the rock  So they don't want  Us on  Which basically  Makes me feel like  Wow  How important is this  Radio show to you guys  But  That'll be determined  I guess  We'll see 
[02:28:00]  But  So we had to deal  With a lot of crap  Over there today  It was weird  We're having a fart discussion  We're arguing the word  We're arguing the word fart  Jimmy was just stupefied  I'm actually arguing  The word fart  With a grown man  That was one of the most  Ridiculous conversations  I ever heard  That is heading  Like  He's heading toward  Retirement fast  I mean  I think he hit 60  He's got what  Five years  And then he could  Officially retire  Tom doesn't look like  That type of guy  That would  I'm just saying  No  He's now 60  And I'm arguing 
[02:28:30]  The word fart  With the guy  Yeah  During commercial breaks  It's like he had to  So weird  He had to go to lawyers  And explain to them  That people want to fart  To ring in and answer questions  Right  It is ludicrous  On some  It's very funny  That men had to have  That discussion  Right  But just the fact  That lawyers  Wouldn't hear that  And go  Oh yeah  It's not  Yeah go ahead  Right  Because they kind of  Have to justify  Their own  Their own existence  Right  And you know what  It was fun  And I think we  Entertained the people  Even with all that  Craziness going on  Over there 
[02:29:00]  I really do  But for some reason  You know  When you stir shit up  You know  Corporate in this day and age  Doesn't like that whatsoever  So I guess  Nothing racial  Nothing mean  Well they pulled our promo  Where we said  The Negro  The Negro  Because they play a promo  After we leave  You know  The sound to listen for  On the Opie and Anthony show  If you want to win $1000  So during  In between the rock music  You'll hear  You know  The contest  And what  Honestly  Did you  Did you not see that coming  I really didn't  Honestly  I honestly knew 
[02:29:30]  That promo was not  Going to play  I'll take it inside my mind  I actually picked that yesterday  Just  Just as a  Just as a test  A little test  To see how far it would go  Because I know  You could say  The Negro  And you could say  The  The N word  Still on the radio  And the FCC  Ain't going to mess  But the Negro  Seemed  Very innocent  I'm like  I'm going to  I'm going to  I'm going to  See how far this goes  And so when  Somebody  Told us  That it got pulled yesterday  I'm like 
[02:30:00]  Okay  Alright  I see  It really was a little test  Yesterday  They should just say  That we need you  To be politically correct  I mean  That's kind of like  I would prefer to hear that  Even though it would bother me  I would prefer to hear  Just be honest  Yeah about it  Yes  That's why  We were having that discussion  I'm just coming from  A point of view  Of like  This is what  We want to do  And this is why  I know you're not  Letting us do it  You don't have to  Yell and scream at people  Or be  You know  Fuck you to them  It's just  You know  They have every right  To do what they're doing  But it just seems like  It's against the grain 
[02:30:30]  Of what's really  Happening out there  On TV especially  Why is radio  Being way held back  And pushed further back  Into the  Quote dark ages  Really  I mean everyone else  Is getting very  Very  Well not very  But they're getting edgier  Because they're competing  With the internet  They understand  Their competition around them  They're embracing the internet  And they're trying to get  A little edgier themselves  Because they understand  That they're in trouble  If they don't  That's all  That's all I'm trying to say  I think this is  Intelligent enough  Where I don't have to  Like take phone calls  From Tom later today 
[02:31:00]  Because we're discussing it  Over here  See this is the new me  Look  Intelligence  Look  Cleverness  It's like  We want to succeed  Over there  It's not like  Oh I can't wait  To get out of there  It's like we want to succeed  I like  You fucking just want  To have some kind of ball  FMQB wrote a great article  On the show  And we said all this stuff  During the article  And it's like  Yeah I still enjoy  Going over there  And trying to figure it out  I absolutely do  There we'll leave you  On that high note  See  Those guys are edgy 
[02:31:30]  It was a black guy  Right  And they referred to him  As an African American  Those guys are nuts  They even hyphenated  They stressed the fact  That they weren't being racist  That's what I want to hear  I'm between 18 and 34  I like edgy guys  They're edgy  Let's say hi to Chris Jericho  Chris  Hey what's going on  There's been  So much confusion 
[02:32:00]  After your last appearance  On the Opie and Anthony show  And then  We were kind of over it  But then  I guess you were on BJ Shea  And it came up again  Oh man  I'll tell you what  First of all  Jericho and Norton  Part 2  This is like the most  This is like the most  Talked about radio show  Of all time  You have people  People commenting on it  On websites  And  It's become legendary  Other shows  I've been doing the book tour  And I was in Seattle last week  And I did the BJ show 
[02:32:30]  And then he just  He was very upset about it  Mr. BJ  So yeah  He was very excitable  About the whole situation  So it's just becoming  Legendary  From coast to coast  Man  From New York  All the way to Washington  Well they had sent me an email  This is Norton  They had sent me an email  And they said  Do you guys object  If we play the audio  For Chris  I actually thought  He was going to the studio  So I'm like  No play it  I mean  We play other people's audio  And I'm like  Hey Tom  I said hello  And you know  Whatever  Hope he's doing good  But I just  You know  Stupid email 
[02:33:00]  And then you're on  And they bring it up  And you're like  Norton  That guy's an idiot  So I'm like  Alright well  Let me say one thing  To be honest with you  As soon as I said that  I felt bad about it  I shouldn't have said that  And I apologize to you  Because what had happened  Because I  It's one of those things  Where I left  I think at like  3.30 in the morning  From LA to fly to Seattle  When I got in  It was kind of  Kind of blindsided me  And I said  That guy's an idiot  And then as soon as I said that  Man I shouldn't have said that  So I apologize to you  Mr. Norton  For calling you  An idiot  On the Washington radio station 
[02:33:30]  So I just want to clear that up  Right off the bat  Alright thank you  That's cool man  It was like  And then you were talking about  The shock comic thing  And it's like  Like that I was kind of  Like taken back  That you had  Called me on something  But I really wasn't man  Like I don't consider myself  To be a shock comic  I honestly don't  And I wasn't  Mad that you called me  On something  I was just kind of  Bothered that you were  Mad at me  Of course I didn't like  The fact that  I do a joke  And someone's pissed off  At me  But I mean  It wasn't like  Whoa this guy  You know  I'm trying to be shocking  And he shut me down 
[02:34:00]  I didn't feel like  I was trying to be shocking  I got you  It's another thing too  Like I honestly  To be honest with you  And this is just being  You know  Being  You know  Clearing the air  And stuff  I didn't really know  Much about  Who you were  Right  And obviously now  I know you have a book  And you have HBO  Especially  You have a pretty big career  It's just one of those things  That when you do a lot of shows  There's a lot of guys  That are kind of like  And you know what I'm talking about  Like opening an anthem  And they'll have like  A couple guys in the studio  Like kind of lackeys  Or whatever  You know what I mean  Like guys that you don't really know 
[02:34:30]  And I didn't know your past  And obviously  Now that I know  It's a whole different thing  That you have a big career  And you know  You're a pretty famous guy  And that's cool  Like I said  It's one of those things  That I think it's been  Blown out of proportion  And in the studio that day  I wasn't even all that mad  To be honest with you  As we kept going  Because it was more fun  Like we were  You know  We were stirring each other up  And Patrice was in there  And Opie and Anthony were in there  And it was actually becoming  It was almost like  To me  It was almost like  A show business thing  Where we were starting to  You know  Mess with each other  And push each other  Those buttons  Which I thought 
[02:35:00]  Like I told my friend afterwards  This is like  The funnest show I've ever done  Because it's real  Yeah Chris it's Opie  I'm confused by that point  Because you absolutely  Were bothered by it  In the beginning  And then  And then  Huh?  Yeah I was  I was bothered by it  Alright so let's at least  Admit that  And then  Then you got over it  I guess  Because you know  I saw it in your eyes  You were like  You were really bothered  By that line  And then I guess  Maybe you understood  In your head  And digested it a little bit  And then  Then I  I kind of believe 
[02:35:30]  That you could have  Possibly been  Like you know  Playing it up a bit  For good radio  And what not  But definitely  In the beginning  You were bothered  And I'll agree  I agree with Chris  On something too  It did at one point  Even though we were  Kind of just going  Back and forth  I mean it wasn't  Horrible  It was just jabs  But there was a weird  Energy which I kind of  Did like  Excuse me  Because it's like  I've argued with  You know  Colin and Patrice  And comedians  For so many years  Like we've just  Bantered back and forth  And attacked each other  And that's just part  Of what we do  But there was a weird  Energy because  He's not a comic  And it's like  He's like 
[02:36:00]  He's a wrestler  And I mean  He wasn't being menacing  In any way  But I'm like  He really could  Just get annoyed  And crack me in the face  And it was like  I certainly didn't want  That to happen  But it kind of  Added a different element  That I certainly  Wasn't used to  Which I kind of  It did make it  Interesting  I'll say that  And Chris  You gotta understand  Jimmy and Patrice  And those guys  They come from a place  I mean  You could understand this  No holds barred  That's what they're all about  Oh they say  Awful things  About each other  Awful things  About their lives  I get that  And I have 
[02:36:30]  A warped sense  Of humor as well  I think under  Different circumstances  I probably would  Think that  A lot of that  You know  That's kind of  The only thing  That bothered me  And not even  The fact of the joke  Of the blink off  And all that stuff  It's the fact that  I said  You know  Don't say it  Don't say it  And then Jimmy  Said it  And that's what  Made me mad  I said  Come on man  Don't say this  And then he did  And that's where  That was where  I was coming from  I felt it was  Kind of like  Come on man  Did you really  Have to do that  If I said  Opie  Let me  People have been  Calling me Mr. Pink 
[02:37:00]  Please don't call me  Mr. Pink  I just don't want to hear it  And then the first thing  You say is  Hey Mr. Pink  How you doing  Let me jump in  If you  If you would have  Said that  Off air  Then that would be  Up to Jimmy  Obviously  But when you say  Something like that  On the air  I don't know man  I mean  When someone says  That to me  The first thing  I need to do  Is say exactly  What he's telling me  Not to say  And I've been  Punching in the face  For doing it  I'm no pussy  I'm not hiding  Behind a microphone  Or anything  I have been  Punching my  Regular light  Cause I 
[02:37:30]  I have said  Or did something  That someone told me  Right to my face  Don't do that  Don't say that  But it's a  It's a tough position  To put Jimmy in  Like  You know  That's fair enough  Man  That's fair enough  Like I said  You know  Everybody  No one likes  Being told what to do  I mean  If you told me  Not to say something  I'd probably say it too  But my point is  Like  We had different opinions  On the subject  And that's cool  That's why  It's good to have  Different people  With different thoughts  And different mindsets  And different opinions  We disagreed on it  We argued about it  And that's kind of  What people do  You know 
[02:38:00]  That's what  I mean  I don't think  It's ever good  If everyone's  Sitting together  On the radio  Or any conversation  Like  Wow  We all agree  The same way  And we're all happy  And flowers are blooming  And the sun is shining  And the air smells clear  It's like  I disagreed  With what he said  He disagreed  With what I said  And we had a little bit  Of a debate about it  And now it's become  You know  A legendary piece  Of radio business  And that's  That's part of show business  That's part of  Entertaining people  I'll give you this much  You had the balls  Come back on our show  A lot of guys  A lot of guys  Why wouldn't I?  Well because a lot of guys  Go and hide 
[02:38:30]  After controversy  And I'll tell you Chris  My thoughts at that exact moment  Like when you said to me  Like don't do it  I can honestly tell you  I know 100%  Where my head was  At the moment  Kind of like  Sometimes like  Something will happen  And people will go  Hey don't go there  Like  They don't really  They're like  Eh don't really say that  Not really meaning it  In a serious way  And it's like  I told you  It was really true too  Like  We handled other things  Other sensitive subjects  That we're talking about  Earlier in the thing  We're handled very kind of like  You know  Respectfully  And cool  And if you had said to me 
[02:39:00]  Hey man come on  He's a friend of mine  Don't go there  I mean maybe it shouldn't  As a comic  But that would have made  A tremendous difference to me  Knowing that it personalized  That for you  And I know a lot of people  Now go  Oh Nord's a pussy  He wouldn't have said it  But I mean that honestly  Would have made a difference for me  And that really is  Just where it was for me  It wasn't to try to be like  Hey fuck him  He told me not to do something  I'm gonna do it  Right  I thought that I did mention  That Chris and I were friends  It was after  It was after  Okay  The point is this man  It's like  And first of all  Like the one thing that you just said  It bothers me on a personal level 
[02:39:30]  Because like  Not bothers me in a bad way  But like  I've known you guys for years man  Like I said  We were the first show  I think we did was in 2000  It's like why wouldn't I come back on  I think it'd be a real pussy thing  Yeah  Not come on  I mean just because you have a disagreement  That's part of  Like I said  You know  I could go on your show  And have a hundred disagreements  And argue toe to toe with you  And call you the biggest fucking prick in the world  Doesn't mean I'm not gonna come back on next time  Because I think our relationship runs deeper than that  And also like I said  For Jimmy  To not go back on and talk to you  It's stupid  Because next time I do the show 
[02:40:00]  Me and Jimmy could be the greatest comedy  Wacky duo of all time  I mean that's  I think to not go back on  It would be a real pussy move  Because there's nothing to  I mean we have an argument  It's done  You know  You have a disagreement  We'll never agree on that point  But that doesn't mean that we can't talk  And you know  Shoot the breeze on other things too  So of course I'm gonna come back on  I guess at this point  We just need an apology from you  Well just cause you know 
[02:40:30]  The thing was blown out of proportion  I think  I think it would just like  Make everyone feel a little better  About themselves  If you apologize  That you might have overreacted  And that was just a joke  I apologize for giving you  The most memorable radio show  Of all time  There you go  Alright  And there's a part two to this  Now you have to officially  Announce on our show  That you're gonna be on Raw  Next week  I apologize for the war in Darfur  I apologize for 
[02:41:00]  Why can't you give us  One lousy scoop  It goes all the way back  To when you wanted me  To admit that I was Chris Jericho  When I was playing Moongoose  I just can't do it now  Doing Moongoose  Come on man  You can never do that now  I mean  Why not blow up  Why not have it happen today  Instead of in some boring press release  That is just kind of released  Let's get the buzz going  Right now  The thing is I think people  Have a sense of entitlement  Nowadays  Because you can go  And like look things up  On the internet  Or things along those lines  I'm a magician 
[02:41:30]  With many secrets and tricks  So I don't like to give things up  I think it's better  Like you could go  And open up your Christmas presents  On December 20th  But there's no fun in that  So I think it's better  Just for everyone  Just to wait and see what happens  And how it unfolds  Well how about give us something  Where the wrestling sites  Half their will go  Well Chris Jericho  Was on Opie Anthony  And he said this about  His return to the WWE  I say my return will be  Sooner than 10 years from now  And later than tomorrow  All right  That's a confirmation right there 
[02:42:00]  Yeah right  That's a confirmation you need  There you go  That's a quote  But remember  For all the wrestling freaks out there  On the Opie and Anthony show  Chris Jericho had the following to say  How's the book tour  All right  Yeah it's going great man  The book is on the New York Times  Bestseller list  Which is very cool  Oh nice  And I'm finished  The US tour  I got to go to Canada today  Up to the land of milk and honey  Oh really  What part of Canada  Are you going to be in?  Oh no 
[02:42:30]  Oh  You know  We had really  Just kind of  Hashed things out  That was cool  Oh man  That was cool  Jimmy and Chris  Really talked to each other  Nicely  How can I be mad  After that  Sam is livid right now  I'm just mad that he was able to get  Turr out  Toronto  What other Canadian cities  Start with Turr  Turr  Turr  Turr  Turr  Turr  Turr  Turr  He's on the bestseller list  Which is impressive  Because right now  Is not an easy time to get on 
[02:43:00]  No  Because  There's just like all these  There's a lot of books  In non-fiction  Right  Like big books in non-fiction  Right  So that's actually  It's really impressive  All right  Who's  Hi who's this?  It's Chris again  I mentioned Canada  You hung up on me  I thought that was a bit  Damn  No  What part of Canada  Are you going to hang up?  Why would that be a bit?  That's boring  That's hack  That's hack crap  That's something BJ would do  Ah nice  You know we can start a BJ  Open Anthony feud  No actually me and him  Go way back  And he 
[02:43:30]  You know  He was  I don't know what he was doing  No he  You know  He felt  He felt the same way as we did  That's what that came down to  You'll get along  You'll get along with him  He's a really good dude man  It's just  Same thing though  We had a 20 minute argument  Like yelling and screaming  At each other  And then as soon as it was done  It was like  Hey man that was great radio  Thanks  Talk to you later  Next time you're in town  Come on in  You know  So I think a lot of people  Have egos  That are very easily bruised  And are very easily shattered  Whereas I think sometimes  A good argument is good for everybody 
[02:44:00]  It's fun  Right  It's fun to debate  It's like being on the high school  Debating team  Hey are they asking  Are they asking you  Are they asking you about steroids  On this whole book tour  Yeah every time  Every show  They ask me about steroids  And they ask me about Benoit  But the best thing is  They ask  Because if it's the first time  That you've ever heard the question  Right  And even better  Is you'll do like these  You know  Morning news shows  Or some of the Fox News  Things that I've done  And you'll have like  A five minute segment  And you'll talk about  You know  The book or whatever  For like three and a half  Four minutes 
[02:44:30]  And the very last  You know  The last minute will be  So how did you feel  When all these things  Happened with first Benoit  And then you got like  45 seconds  And it's like  Yeah let me wrap it up  Do you really want to  Yeah exactly  Like do you really want  To get into this now  Give me half an hour  I'll tell you  Nah they're a bunch of pussies  Because they know  If they ask that question  Right off the bat  That you would probably walk  Or might walk  Or other celebrities  Would walk  When it comes to that  You know  Controversial stuff  It's just  It's a lame way  To do an interview  Now you've attributed  Your success  In your career  To steroids right 
[02:45:00]  I'm 100%  I'm up there  Right now  You heard here  First  100%  When you had  When you had  Like now  Like there was  Like one security guard  That came into the room  The other day  But now we're going to say  There was like  12 security guards  Of course  I was foaming  At the mountain  And you just  Take them all on  You had me  Actually chained  By a collar  Why wouldn't you  Just like  You know  Blow up your spot  And just completely  Admit it  Like say  Oh I was  I was doing steroids  So much  I didn't know  Where I was anymore  Why not just go 
[02:45:30]  The other way  With it on national TV  How well it went  For Danny Bonaduce  That would be the best  Way to do it  Next time  Just freak out  Like actually walk out  With a needle  Sticking out of my arm  Oh sorry  You can pull it out  Yeah  Oh jeez  I'm sorry  I always forget  That darn thing  Like having a bit  Of food on your face  Or something  Oh sorry  Is this gone now  That's why I don't think  We'll ever be part  Of the mainstream  Because as we're  Joking about that  I'm like yeah  That'd be a cool  Thing to do  Like we wouldn't  Consider doing  Something like that  Did you hear the way  CNN kind of  Douched John Cena 
[02:46:00]  They just  They replayed part  Of his answer  See this is the thing  And this is one thing  I learned about  A lot of media  Over the summer  When I did a few  Of the shows  That I did  Talking about Benoit  Is that it's very  Manipulative  Sensationalistic  And for those  People who don't know  They did a story  On steroids  And wrestling  All this  That and other thing  And they did  An interview  With John Cena  Where they just  Used a little clip  Of his quote  And they used it  Out of context  But the stupid  Thing about it  Is that the WB  Was filming  The entire interview  So not only  Did they do  Like misleading journalism 
[02:46:30]  But they did it  With an actual camera  Filming it  At the same time  So and this  Is scary to me  Like if CNN  Is going to do this  About a wrestling story  That's what I was  What else did they  Manipulate  Up  Yeah  Yeah let me play it  It's really quick  We cut it right down  Because it's worth mentioning  I  Yeah  This isn't getting  As much play as it should  This is kind of scary crap  So this is CNN  Makes it seem like  Cena is taking steroids  Listen to this clip  John Cena  Is a WWE superstar  Now recovering 
[02:47:00]  From an injury  In the ring  He doesn't like  Being asked  If he has used steroids  This is a crazy question  And it's something that  It's tough to answer  Just because of the way  Society is now  I can't tell you  That I haven't  But you'll never be able  To prove that I have  So what does that  Make it sound like  There  Sounds like  I'm not talking  Yeah  But I do  I do them  But I'm not talking  About it  Doesn't that make it  Sound like  Look you know  I've done them  But you know  Prove it  Prove that I have 
[02:47:30]  Right  Sounds like a very  Arrogant statement  Right  So  And then  I didn't know  WWE was in the room  Filming  Is this what they do  To cover their own ass  Absolutely  Good idea  So this is  The WWE  Camera roll  Listen to this  Same thing  Absolutely not  And this is  Even back in  Bodybuilding days  Football days  This is a crazy question  My answer  To that question  Have you ever used steroids  Is the only thing  I can say  I can't tell you 
[02:48:00]  That I haven't  But you'll never be able  To prove that I have  Because each one of you  Each one of you  Out there  Has an opinion  On how I carry myself  And I can take  A million tests  I've been tested for drugs  Since I've been 17 years old  I can take a million tests  I can pass every one of them  As soon as I pass it  There's some other guy  On the other end  Going oh there's  Masking agents  To this there's that  I know the arguments  Because I've been in the situation  There you go  There's the news  That we're supposed to trust  And you know  Anthony explained exactly  What he was trying to say  Because then even  After he said  Absolutely not 
[02:48:30]  It was kind of like  He says I can't  I can't tell you  I haven't  He means like  I can't tell you anything  You know  You guys are going to  Make up whatever you want  It wasn't like  I can't tell you  I haven't  Because I have  It was obvious  What he was saying  But the way they edited it  It made it sound like  I can't tell you  That I haven't  Because  Well you know  I don't want to lie  Or I have taken it  And they knew how important  It was  You know  The part where he goes  Absolutely not  That would be just  Oh  We got to cut that out 
[02:49:00]  Pulls it out of the water  So cut that  And then it gets a little  Gray over here  Very important part out  Even though he was  Kind of referring to  Something else  And just the way they said  He doesn't like being  Asked about steroids  Like he was given  Some disgusted answer  But he actually answered it  Articulately  And honestly  Yeah  No but it's like  You guys said too  This isn't Inside Edition  Or TMZ TV  This is CNN  The most respected  Name in journalism  Blah blah blah blah blah  Right  What a bunch of bullshit  I mean that's fucking bullshit  Now you hear that  And like you said  This isn't getting 
[02:49:30]  Half as much play  As it should  Because once again  It's just lowly wrestling  If this was like  A politician  Or Barack Obama  Or something like that  There'd be a witch hunt  Going through  You know  It really is scary  When you think about  How manipulative that was  For just that one little clip  So what else do we hear  That's being manipulated  For every single subject  From the biggest of the big  To the smallest of the small  Yeah I wonder that  All the time  Absolutely  How do you answer  The steroid question Chris?  Well you know  For me  Like I said  I realized  In a very early part 
[02:50:00]  Of my career  That it wasn't going  To make a difference  Because I'm never  Going to be 6 foot 8  I'm never going to be  250 pounds  No matter what kind of drugs  I would take or didn't take  I had to think of  A different way  To try and make it  And think outside of the box  And work on my personality  And make that the biggest part  Of my character  Was you know  The show business aspect of it  Yeah I gotta tell you  It's a pain in the ass  To be naturally caught  And big  Like myself  You know  We know it  And that's one of the problems  I'm very jealous  One of the reasons  Why I was so angry this day  And had so much aggression  Just looking at all the muscle 
[02:50:30]  In this room  I understand  I have to stare at this room  Hopefully you guys  Look like Greek gods  That walk in there  You know what  It's true  I have to downplay it all the time  I wear baggy stuff  I'm you know  And then I get a little  A little outrageous  On the radio show  And they're like  Yeah  Broid rage obviously  And it's a pain in the ass  To be asked that a lot  And little Jimmy Norton  If you haven't actually  Seen the guy  It's like when they call  A big guy tiny  They call him little  Because he's 6 foot 8  380 pounds  He's got a cock like a bear  If I didn't talk  They'd think I was a statue  It's a marbled statue 
[02:51:00]  Like how he brought up  Your cock  I do too  It was nice of him  Please get  Please get a sound drop  Of that  Just put that on my seat  It's fantastic  By the way  I don't know  Jericho and Norton  Are talking about  Each other's cocks  The next time I go to  Washington  We'll be arguing  About that now  But Norton does not  Have a big cock  I don't care what you say  By the way  You don't go in there  And tell Norton  How big his cock is  We need the boys  To go to TMZ  Because I forgot to mention  This until right now  So the John Cena thing  It's getting a lot of play  On TMZ I believe 
[02:51:30]  And then they  They basically said  I think it was on  The TV show  So we're going to have  To get that  And also they're like  Watch we'll show you  How easy this is to do  So they go  Hey Larry  As in Larry King  Larry have you ever  You know done steroids  And his aunt's like  Yeah absolutely  Yeah absolutely  And then they go  See how easy that was  It's kind of funny  We got to play that  We'll find that  Alright Chris  Alright fellas  See this conversation  Was a let down  For everyone  I thought we were  Going to be yelling  And screaming at each other  Yeah maybe next time  Next time we'll have 
[02:52:00]  To find something else  So Norton  Keep your freaking nose clean  Because you're lucky  I didn't reach through  You're lucky  I didn't pop your head off  Like a fucking zit  The other day  You understand me  I actually agree with that  I can't argue  I'm grateful for the same thing  He is lucky  That that didn't happen  It's true  First of all  I don't think it's that  First of all  I don't think it's that boring  It's a real moment  And now that we've  Kind of smoothed things over  I need to know one thing  Chris  And you've got to be honest  I don't want you to play a role  Or any of that crap  Okay  You're talking to us 
[02:52:30]  Opie and Anthony  We try to keep it honest here  How close were you  To hitting little Jimmy Norton  On a scale of 1 to 10  Probably about  Probably about a 2  And I'll tell you the reason why  Jimmy just went  Because he's been wondering himself  I don't think  I would ever hit somebody  Because of a debate  Or a conversation  Or anything along those lines  Because that would be  Such a stereotypical  Quote unquote  Wrestler thing to do  And to be honest with you  The moment I was the most pissed off 
[02:53:00]  The whole time  Is when the security guard  Came in the room  I found that to be  Very pretentious  And very  You know  I thought it was  Like why would I  Ever hit somebody  As a guest on your show  To come in there  And punch somebody  A. I don't want to get sued  I'm not that stupid  I've got too much money  To lose  That's a good A  And B  Like how  Like how patronizing  Would it be  For you know  It was very patronizing  For the security guard  To come in  And how bad  Would that look for me  For other wrestlers  For anybody  I thought that would be 
[02:53:30]  The exact opposite thing  I would do  If some guy came in the room  With a knife  Trying to you know  Slice me  Or you or anybody  The guy's going to get  His ass whipped  But as a conversation  And an argument  There's no way man  Absolutely not  Yeah I'll be honest  I didn't at any point  Feel like that was a vibe  I thought we were pissed off  At each other  But I never felt like  That was a real  I mean of course  My thought is there  Because of my own  I still realize  I'm talking to a guy  Who could throw me  Out the window  But there was nothing  He did to indicate  That he was close to that  Of course not 
[02:54:00]  Of course not  And like I said  That would be such  A bullshit thing  For me to do  That puts me  That puts me  At a completely  Asshole level  Which I never  I never try to get to  Now verbally  I might have been  An asshole  But physically  Absolutely not  Now before I go  I just want to say  I heard you talking  About how hard it is  To get on the best  Star list  And did your book  Make it on the best  Star list Jimmy  I did yes  But I have to say  And this is not  Mock humility  I did it  In an easier time  It was over the summer  My book came out  In July  But right now  The non-fiction part  Of the best  Star list  Is broken down  To fiction 
[02:54:30]  Non-fiction  There's a lot  Of books  Recently come out  For non-fiction  So the fact  That you made the list  Is huge  It's really impressive  My book probably  Did better than yours  Then  It's very possible  Yeah  I mean  I'm glad you wrote  A little book  No no no  Dude  Believe me  A lot of times  The easy reads  Do do better  Jimmy had to compete 
[02:55:00]  With Harry Potter  But that's fiction  So  That's fiction  Oh wow  I believe  It is  Yeah  Hey  I had to compete  With Stephen Colbert  And Ronnie Wood  Yeah  My book did better  Than Ronnie Wood  Not even the guitar player  In the Stones  Albeit the second guitar player  That not a lot of people know  Not even he could combat  Chris Jericho  Daddy-o  That is big to do it right now  Alright and you're going to be on  WWE Raw Monday right  I will probably be in the stand  Selling popcorn  Because it's right down the street  From my house  Survivor Series 
[02:55:30]  Where are we at there Chris  Come on  When does it all happen  I'm a magician  With many tricks  And I will surprise you  When it happens  Just like Harry Potter  You discussed earlier  So the book tour  Hits Toronto  Hits Toronto  Winnipeg this week  Yeah  Alright  We're on XM Canada  So the big plug  For the book signing  Absolutely  I will be  In Wednesday  Oh  I got tricks too  Oh god  I got some tricks  Do you think he's laughing right now 
[02:56:00]  Looking at the phone  I got some tricks too  Or is he imagining  Taking the phone  And just  Punching you in the face  He's probably  He's probably doing both  He's probably laughing  At the image of just  Belting him with the phone  In his hand  Right now he's going  A ten  Seriously  He said he had tricks  I had to go there  It's a ten right now  I'm very happy  That he called in  That's very cool man  You agree  I agree to disagree  That's great dude  I'm glad  I don't have a bad relationship  On the show  Alright  It's Opie and Anthony  Hey this is Chris Jericho 
[02:56:30]  And you're listening  To my little pal  Little  Jimmy  Norton  Isn't he sweet  Isn't he cute  Don't you just want to kiss him  Every knee must bend  Every head must bow  Every tongue must confess  Thou art the greatest  The greatest of all time  Ella  Ella  A  A  Yeah we suck  Opie and Anthony y'all 
[02:57:00]  We return 
[02:57:30]  And just  To give  Plugs for Canada  If you want to go see  See Chris  To the book signs  Wednesday the 14th  That's tomorrow  In Toronto  Ontario  It's Indigo Books  On Easton Centre  Easton Centre  220  Yonge Street  Jesus Canada  Has awful names  Y-O-N-G-E Street  7 o'clock  That's in Toronto  Tomorrow night  Indigo Books 
[02:58:00]  And Thursday  McNally Robinson Bookseller  8pm in Winnipeg  On 1120 Grant Avenue  8 o'clock  Grant Avenue  That is odd  Well alright  You're right  Grant Avenue  Is very normal  Maybe it's Toronto  And that communist influence  Because we all know  That the Soviets  Influenced Toronto  Of course  So you know  Doesn't know that  Toronto Wednesday  And Winnipeg Thursday  Winnipeg  That really was a bad example  To follow it up with  Though Grant  Grant  Chris Jericho 
[02:58:30]  Hey  I was just talking  To some people  At WWE  And I have  A big announcement  That I want to make  On the opening  Anthony show  You really think  I'm going to fall for this  Are you insane  Here's the announcement  I will be returning  To the WWE  On  Click  Is he insane  Are you insane  Chris Jericho  And that was him  Hanging up  I thought that was bullshit  And then when he said  I will be returning  I actually was like  Oh it's a real announcement 
[02:59:00]  Yeah  I'm a fucking  I'm an idiot  Do you really think  We're falling for this  The steroids  Are getting to your head  He never  Did steroids  Oh alright  Dud  Never dud steroids  Here we go  This is the Larry King  Thing I was talking about  Larry King  Before the show  Where the TMZ  Was all over the  John Cena  You know  CNN thing  Yeah  Making it look like  John Cena  Did steroids  When he said  Absolutely not  So this is what  TMZ would do with that  CNN had no comment  But Larry King  When was the last time 
[02:59:30]  You did steroids  June of 1993  In New York  See  We can do that too  Oh that's great  That's why  June of 93  It went right to my  Big head  CNN is a fucking  Disgrace for doing that  I mean what a  Fucking disgrace  How desperate were they  To get a steroid story going  Someone made that decision  They listened to the audio  And went okay  Cut that out  Cut that out  And knew  They should be fired  Knew  That they were pulling  Shenanigans  Is there any  Is there any comment  From the network  I don't know 
[03:00:00]  It's not  It should be a bigger story  Why isn't that a big story  It's not big  Because it's wrestling  I think TMZ  Kind of broke that  And no one takes TMZ seriously  So it's going to  Kind of just go away  Unfortunately  Because it's wrestling  I think is the reason  It's not a big deal  What do you got Sam  Well that story  Just said no comment  Yeah yeah  There was no comment  At all from CNN  Right of course not  But I'm just saying  Why isn't there a big story  A bigger story  Out there in general  God what scumbags  No comment  No comment  No comment  I know

[03:28:00]  They're not academy  Award winning  Actresses  And they are  Gagging  On this shit  It still has to suck  But probably doesn't  Suck as bad  Dude when you watch them  When they put people  To duty  And the consistency  Of it is not chocolate  It's poop  It's crap  That guy is trying  To find a reason  Because the humanity  In him  Cannot accept the fact  Exactly  It's gotta be CGI  I'm telling you  Please I don't wanna  Accept that this is happening  He needs that to be ice cream  So he can feel  Comfortable reproducing 
[03:28:30]  He would  He's  That hits him  On a visceral level  But no it's  It's real  Again if this was  A Hollywood movie  Like if Hugh Jackman  Say shit into the mouth  Of George Clooney  And that's  So what if I've  Jerked off to that  Let's just say  Another example  If you want  That would be  CGI'd and phony  This is a  Brazilian scat film  This is not a  High budget production  It's five starving  Women in a room  You toss them  A few bucks  They are going  To eat shit  Of course they are  And produce a copious  Amount if I may  Yes 
[03:29:00]  Alright well then  Let's move on to Steve  Ramon  The Ramon promo  Getting rave reviews  Wow  Except for this one  Someone calling you  A predictable ass  What  Besides that  I didn't see that coming  Very good review  I didn't see the cup  I didn't either  But again  I'm just reading  What is written  I thought  I thought he was  Gurgling and everything  And there was going to be  A big mess  And Ramon was going to  Have to clean it up  Somehow  But I didn't see  The cup line coming  Well if I may  This is part one  Of a part two  Of at least a two part 
[03:29:30]  I hate two parters  Do I dare say  Trilogy  Could be a trilogy  Could be a quadrology  If you will  Quadrology  How about a septology  Or a sestology  A sest  Sest  Sest  Could be a bisexual  Too  Yeah  Could be  Sure it is  I will reveal  Ramon  Let's stop pretending  You might  You could come out  In character  That would be  Good enough for us 
[03:30:00]  When is  When can we  Look forward to part two  I have to voice  A few things  And I have to just  Figure out the way  It's going to end  Because  It gets a little  You know  I'm not going to  You're crossing  The picket lines  By writing  You know  You're writing  If I was unionized  Yeah I would be  But you know  That's true  Yeah  Well the voiceover guy  Probably wouldn't do any work  Oh yeah it's true  He wouldn't  But he's  But this is just  A private moment  With him and Ramon  Yeah I know  But it's being used publicly  And he probably  Wouldn't like that  But yeah 
[03:30:30]  It's just an inner  Just a look inside  What the deep voice guy  Has for breakfast  And this one is actually  Called breakfast at Ramon's  Why would it be at Ramon's  If the big voice guy  Owns the house  Well Ramon happens to live there  And breakfast at deep voice guys  Just didn't have the ring to it  Ramon's  Okay  Someone suggested we play  Pick it or kick it  With the Ramon promo  That's Scott Edmiston  I would give it a picket 
[03:31:00]  How about Scott Edmiston  Produce a fucking Ramon promo  Oh shit  What do they do on rock stations  They play a new song  And they call it  To flush it  Or  What is it  Smash or trash  Or something  Smash or trash  Smash or trash  Or dressing  Some  Some  Shit  Sounds edgy  But really isn't  I'm with you  Smash or trash  Yeah  All the men are gonna run  To that promo  That's edgy  Ed said linger longer  But he said it 
[03:31:30]  Very normal voice  Well I was tentative on it  I wasn't sure  Because I didn't hear  Anybody heard it  Jimmy tell me how to  Linger longer  Please  Linger longer  Linger longer  I'm incapable of doing that  Join the linger longer  I'm having a linger longer party  And you're invited  I can never do that  There's a lot of linger longer  Listening right now  So join us  Linger longer 
[03:32:00]  There's no way in hell  I could do that  Or would I  It's flattering to you  Because it's based on  Your Greaseman impression  A lot of people say  No it isn't  I do a bad Greaseman  I'm not trying to do  A bad Greaseman  I'm trying to take something  That he does do  And make it  You're making it your own  So I'll just  I'll just  Yes let it just  Deteriorate into that  Pump it or dump it  Pump it or dump it  No I don't think 
[03:32:30]  I've ever heard that one  Porky  Why do things have to rhyme  On like why does  How out of touch  Are rock people  Where they think  That rhyming is cool  Like how about just  You like this song  Or it sucks  It doesn't rhyme  Exactly  Jam it or cram it  What  You could do that  Play it or don't say it  Alright we got it  Crank it or spank it  Whoa  Rock  Get out of the way folks  Rock in the house  Alright we did the taser parties 
[03:33:00]  Did the sun burning out  We did the old lady  Getting fucking  My first dates  Lead to sex  We did that  Yes we did  We've  What  What will happen  We've outtakes of Steve's voice work  If that's a nice  Thing or if you'd like to spend  More time on that  That means we'd have to do  More radio fan  And I don't want to  Okay  Alright we will  You know what this means though  We're setting up for leaving early  In the very near future 
[03:33:30]  Of course  That's what we do  I don't really get these outtakes  From Steve though  No  Not really  Someone can set it up  They're just ridiculous things Steve  This ridiculous sound Steve  Has made into a microphone  Oh okay  In recording  Alright here we go  Like this one  What  Why would you do that  And why would they always have to say what  It brings them back  Because it brings  Yeah it brings me back to  Whatever I'm doing  And usually it's someone  Trying to get my attention  Like Derek saying  Could you stop being an asshole 
[03:34:00]  For two minutes  Yeah  And I believe number two  Is a favorite sound effect  Of us around the office  Oh this one  Oh I love this one  Steve likes to make this  When we're trying to talk to him  That's not true  Ow  That's a good Steve sound  Yeah  Yes  Who are you?  Oh  I'm Sam  Sam  How are you?  How's your internship going?  I'm not an intern anymore  Oh  Remember? 
[03:34:30]  Roy  Steve  That's our favorite Steve sound clip  Because he constantly makes it in the office  While at CBS  In his you know  Private office  And he did it one day  Not realizing that Tracy was in the main office  Oh  In earshot  Ew  So he made the sound  And Danny and me kept asking him what he said  And so he kept repeating it  Oh no  They rolled out of the office  And saw Tracy  In his chair  And mid  Oh 
[03:35:00]  Looked right at Tracy  And said  I didn't know you were in here  Good cover  Yeah  I mean  I really  I  You know  I tried to play it cool  But there's really no way to play it cool  When you're in mid  Ow  You didn't  Yeah  So now what they do is  They accost me  By  While I'm on the phone  I'll have a chorus of these fucking guys  Yeah  Yeah 
[03:35:30]  That's all they do  That's all they do now  Is try to distract me from whatever I'm doing by doing that  Any  Oh my god  I just saw the most funniest headline ever  You see this thing  Jesus  He goes  His girlfriend nursed him back to health  So he'll never cheat on her  Yeah  Did you see the guy  That said that  Yeah  Yeah  She cheated on him  Or  No he cheats on her  After she  She like  Nursed him back to health  It looks like his face fell off 
[03:36:00]  And they put it back on  What do they cheat on her with  A fucking  A piece of liver  A fucking  A hollowed out ham  No one would fuck this guy  His mouth is hanging open  Oh my god  We get the idea what happened  He's on Maury  And he's got like  His mouth is kind of open  And he looks like a fucking  A Cro-Magnon skeleton  Oh it's paying for sex  It's awful  Watching her nurse me back to life  And realized how much  I loved her  When I woke up in her glaucoma  She was one of the first persons I saw  People stupid  And I don't think 
[03:36:30]  I could have made it  Through all that without her  I'm not cheating  And even if I were  No one would even want me  With the way I look now  I need her to believe me  When I tell her  I'm not cheating  Who wouldn't believe him  I'm gonna bring him out here now  He looks like Steve Buscemi  With Down Syndrome  That stupid hat  Oh he's got a mullet  Oh he's a mess  I wonder what happened  His face has been sewn back on though  Yeah  Oh an accident  Do you believe that you wouldn't be here  If it wasn't for her? 
[03:37:00]  Yeah if it wasn't for her  And her showing me the love  That she showed me  I probably would have committed suicide  A long time  He must have a big cock  You know what she's gonna do  If she finds out  That you've failed this test  She can leave me  I won't want that to happen  You know  Because I love her  Oh my god  Only one eye blinks  Oh he's awful  He's licking his lips  The side of his face that fell off  The underwear that Kim found on the couch  Has no nerves  Were they from a woman you were cheating with?  You said no  The lie detector test determined  That was the truth 
[03:37:30]  Who are they from?  He probably used them to catch his spit into  Wearing them himself  He dabbed them on his stupid dead lip  This guy's a mess  What's wrong with him?  I do that because I need a feed bag  Under my chin  Because when I talk  I leak a lot of fluid  Did you know that hair is my dad?  Alright here's another Steve sound  You fucking cat and heat  What's the matter with you?  What do you make these noises? 
[03:38:00]  And that's sometimes  When we're trying to tell Steve  You know  I haven't done that in weeks  That's because we've mercilessly  Mercilessly mocked you about it  That's true  How could you not  How could he expect to not be mocked about that?  Awful  Keep it under your hat  Yeah  I didn't realize  How are you not making production?  What are you doing?  I don't fucking know  How is that?  I'm so punchy by the time I  You know  Get  However  Long it takes to 
[03:38:30]  You know  Wait  He's practicing his tranny voice  You're right  He's gonna go through a full transformation  I have no excuse  I'm just an odd boy  You make strange noises  How are you not making production with those voices?  Tim's voices are awful  That  Is almost not of our species  Well now that you mention it  I think Danny's got a concept for all these things to come together nicely  Why don't we do one live, Steve?  Poe, put the truck away  Why? What happened? 
[03:39:00]  I forgot I'm staying for a little while  Oh that's right  Yeah, Poe left about 15 minutes  Oh Jesus  Put the truck back  In the middle of our chest  Thank you  What are you doing after the show?  I'm eating  I'm having lunch  Oh cool  Where are we going?  Who said we?  I don't know  I think the whole crew is going  Get out of here  Who are you having lunch with?  My girl  What about um  Um  Yeah  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll  Time for the line of the day? 
[03:39:30]  Yes  I think so  Because I have to right now  Get rid of this smoothie  Via my rectum  Well  If we could recreate something  We just saw  Big fella  That's right  Who wants to be old  Bucket of shit mouth  Cat in heat Steve  Rub his ass  And watch him stick it up in the air  You better be careful  You better be careful 
[03:40:00]  Otherwise we'll make a movie called  Three Men No Stations  Swim, walk, I should  Steve, do your  Oh, uh  Brian Poughkeepsie  Hey guys  Hey bro  Love you, love the show  I'm a bitch  Yeah  Bye bye  Welcome  Oh  What's up, Brian?
