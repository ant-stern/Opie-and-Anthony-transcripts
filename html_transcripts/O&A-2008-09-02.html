<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Opie detailing his injured toe and the hosts discussing their long weekend.  A significant portion focuses on Sarah Palin's vice-presidential candidacy, including extensive (and often vulgar) commentary about her daughter's pregnancy and marriage.  Opie boasts about unusual new shoes sent by "brother Weez."  The hosts heavily criticize the over-the-top Hurricane Gustav news coverage, particularly Geraldo Rivera's reporting and a local news reporter's dramatic canoe trip through ankle-deep water. Shepard Smith's near-swear words are also mentioned.  Remote contributor Sam Roberts calls in from the Republican National Convention, recounting interactions with protesters, including a discussion about the word "queer."  The hosts review *The Dark Knight*, criticizing Christian Bale and praising Heath Ledger, and comment on Don LaFontaine's death and the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon.

The show features a prolonged search for Opie's embarrassing videotape of his participation in a muscular dystrophy telethon, showing him singing Guns N' Roses on a ladder with a noose.  This leads back to further vulgar commentary about Sarah Palin,  David Duchovny's sex addiction, and an upcoming book detailing scandalous Dallas Cowboys behavior, including Charles Haley's alleged locker room exhibitionism.  P. Diddy's video blog criticizing Palin is played and mocked.  The segment includes listener calls, sports news, a bizarre "Love and Licks" sex toy commercial, and a replay of Geraldo Rivera's Hurricane Gustav coverage.

A *Beetle Bailey* comic strip about a gassy Sergeant leads to a discussion about a man attempting self-amputation with a butter knife after a cocaine incident.  A news story about a murdered 100-year-old woman follows, with speculation about motives.  The conversation shifts to Sarah Palin's vice-presidential responsibilities, then to the "I like turtles" kid, and finally to past awkward celebrity interviews.  A Katy Perry song ("I Kissed a Girl") is played.  The show then replays clips of uncomfortable past interviews with Ed Asner, Steve the Whistler, Linda Blair (interrupted with "The power of Christ compels you!"), Mr. DVD, and Cindy Williams (with vulgar jokes and sexually explicit insinuations). An upcoming Jerry Springer interview is mentioned.

A caller shares fabricated caddy stories, including Bob Newhart's death.  The hosts discuss their show's preemption for college football on Sirius XM, explained by Sirius XM employee Danny as a bandwidth issue.  This leads to more crude and offensive discussion about Sarah Palin, Joe Biden, and Palin's son's pregnancy.  A sexually explicit pornographic audio clip is played.  A humorous, vulgar discussion follows about a supposed Kathie Lee Gifford segment involving spiked watermelon cocktails and an embellished anecdote about the origin of the term "cocktail." A segment featuring "Spaz," a mentally challenged individual, and clips of his appearances are discussed, along with vulgar jokes and comments.  A phone call from Jerry Springer follows, discussing *America's Got Talent*, including anecdotes about Sharon Osbourne and David Hasselhoff.

Jerry Springer appears as a guest,  with initial crude jokes about a previous limbless guest. The discussion covers Springer's shows, and the hosts graphically describe various forms of pornography, quizzing Springer on his familiarity. Springer expresses disapproval of the vice-presidential selection process, and the hosts and Springer engage in banter about politics, pornography preferences (including a joke about fat women fighting topless), and Springer's show opening.  Rumors of *America's Got Talent* being rigged are also discussed. The segment features crude jokes, sexual innuendo, and listener-submitted "line of the day" entries, some sexually suggestive or offensive. The show concludes with off-color humor and a final teapot joke.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Who the hell is Sarah Palin?  We've been waiting, what, two, three days to say that.  Why did we have Friday off?  Why?  Man.  We needed to be here Friday.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  So, phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Everybody enjoy their long weekends.  Not long enough.  You know how it is.  It was a nice little break.  I like that, yeah.  It was nice, four days.  But that first alarm goes off after a few days vacation time.  And you're just like, oh, brother.  Yeesh.  You're absolutely right.  Get yourself out of bed.  Later today, I've got to go get an x-ray.  I forgot to tell you, during the show prep hour. 
[00:01:00]  Really?  Just because of what you just said.  The alarm goes off and you're like, what the hell?  I'm not used to this.  And the old toe stub on the side of the bed post.  Oh.  My little piggy got it bad.  It's already really black and blue.  That will wake you up, though.  Oh, yeah.  I'll tell you that.  And still pulsating like it has a little headache or something.  A little headache.  But the nail is completely black and blue already, two hours later. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, man.  You're in trouble.  I got my moon shoes on, though, so I'm walking better.  I got to say, those are a little goofy.  Yeah.  Just a tad goofy.  I hope we got new shoes.  Well, they're like sneakers, apparently.  What are they supposed to do?  Well, stupid brother Weez, my mentor in this business, he calls me up.  He goes, brah, I got these new shoes.  I want to turn you on to these new shoes.  Give me your address.  I'm going to send you a pair.  And this is going to be the next big thing? 
[00:02:00]  Supposedly, they're the next big thing.  Yeah.  Not getting paid for this.  And honestly, I can't even call this plugola because I think I might just throw these shoes out after today.  I'm not really sure yet.  Call them crapple.  I guess the brand is MBT or something like that.  And there's not much of a heel.  And you kind of just roll.  You kind of just roll forward.  Yeah.  The bottom of the sneaker is shaped.  It's a, what the hell do you call that? 
[00:02:30]  It's like a seesaw.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Almost when you're not walking, you're kind of bouncing on a seesaw.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Well, when you start walking forward, it is very easy to walk because it just naturally kind of rolls you forward.  I've been walking for a while now.  And I don't think I've had any trouble as far as footwear goes.  I think the standard heel.  I hope in a year you guys are all laughing at me.  This is like the thing.  Everyone is wearing them.  What?  I want to take a picture.  Yeah.  Take a picture of my MBT, I think it's called.  I think a bigger thing are the ones with wheels in them that the kids go around. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Heely.  A little Heely.  Oh, I tried to get like the adult version of Heely's and the lady at the store laughed at me.  I'm like, what?  It looks like a great way to like, you know, tool around malls and stuff.  Get around.  Those look like sneakers for like short people.  They have like the extra height and they give you some lift.  They're like almost like lifts on the bottom.  Yeah.  That's the other problem.  It's a moon shoe.  That's the other problem.  I'm now about 6'3".  Yeah.  Is that the McFly 2015? 
[00:03:30]  Wish.  Wish.  Yeah.  So, brother Weez, brah.  So, Weez, I'm wearing them today.  I don't know.  You rock back and forth.  It looks a little dangerous.  Honestly, though, the walking was pretty cool.  You just kind of roll forward.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We'll give him a shot.  Good luck to you.  Why not?  Why not?  Yeah.  Where do you want to begin?  There was so much going on the last few days.  Oh, my God.  Well, I guess everybody's, you know, talking about Sarah Palin.  Yes. 
[00:04:00]  Sarah, our Republican vice presidential candidate.  You know, there's no gray area with this one.  It could be the greatest move ever for the Republican Party.  Not for John McCain.  For the Republican Party.  Because the whole Republican Party got behind this.  They were having closed-door meetings to figure this one out and go, we're going to go with  a woman vice president.  They made it sound like they were all surprised.  Like, McCain just kind of picked it himself and said, yeah, here she is.  Yeah.  And they all went like, what?  And the obvious thing, everyone's saying that she looks just like Tina Fey. 
[00:04:30]  You can't have Tina Fey as your vice president.  Well, but.  And then the one, Megan Mullally, looks a little like her.  She was a beauty contest queen, I guess.  That's what people are saying.  And she's in charge of Alaska, apparently.  She's hot for a MILF, but she's not that hot.  I was disappointed because I didn't see the picture.  And I heard, you know, some hot MILF that won a beauty pageant. 
[00:05:00]  I'm like, wow, I can't wait to Google her.  Yeah.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  So it's either going to be the greatest thing ever for the Republican Party or the greatest  bust.  Yeah.  This is like an all-in, man.  Oh, yeah.  You're definitely all-in on a marginal hand.  Like, it's not even a good bluff or anything else.  It's just, I got a marginal hand.  I'm hoping the rest of the cards help me out.  For my Omaha players, because, you know, Anthony plays the hold'em. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  I play the Omaha, where you have four cards in the hole.  Sure.  You got a nice pair of aces.  Yeah.  With nothing on the table yet.  That's what this is all about.  Yeah, yeah.  Will the aces pay off in the end, or we'll be a massive bust?  You're just going to get beat out.  Someone's going to suck out on you.  But, I mean, you know, you got to love her, Ant.  Well.  She's got a daughter that's 17 and knocked up already.  She's got a little slut daughter.  Slut daughter.  That's cool. 
[00:06:00]  She likes to shoot and kill things.  Well, she's apparently a lifetime member of the NRA, which is good.  I think that's good for Second Amendment, for people that are, you know, for the Second  Amendment.  I think that's nice.  And, well, I think she'll appeal to the moms.  I believe, even though her voice is a little grating, she's a decent speaker as far as speeches  go.  She did a good job when she went up there and kind of accepted. 
[00:06:30]  But, I don't know.  That whole daughter being pregnant thing is a little odd.  A little unwed.  It's such a family values thing.  And, they're actually trying to spin it that way.  The Republicans are like, this is great.  And, her and her husband are just like, we've been blessed.  Our daughter came to us and informed us that we're going to be grandparents.  Hey, how about the husband part?  Yeah.  That's something that I think all conservative Republicans are against. 
[00:07:00]  Of course.  Babies out of wedlock.  Of course.  So, they're marrying these two off real quick.  Yeah.  Oh, forcing this guy to get married.  And, this poor son of a bitch.  This is coming out today, but Anthony turned me on to this kid.  This kid doesn't want to be married.  No.  Doesn't want to have a kid.  Just wants to be a redneck playing hockey.  Dude, he's a high school hockey player.  He wants to just shoot caribou.  Yeah.  On weekends.  He doesn't want anything to do with a kid and a wife.  No.  But, the Republican Party, I think the men in the dark suits came in knocking. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, they did.  I will marry her.  You're getting married.  Yeah.  This is how it's going to work.  You're going to get married.  Immediately.  And, that's it.  She's going to be your wife.  Make no plans.  Make no plans this weekend.  It's going down this weekend.  Oh, it's going down quick.  Believe me.  But, they took his MySpace off.  Yeah.  Because, his MySpace had certain things like, I'm just an effing redneck. 
[00:08:00]  I like to shoot crap.  But, he was using vulgarities.  Things we can't say here.  I like to shoot crap.  And, he goes, you eff with me and I'll eff you up.  And, then the other thing was a relationship.  It said, he's not in a relationship and does not want children.  That was the big quote.  So, they got a problem right off the bat.  They got to get this kid married.  Uh-huh.  Immediately. 
[00:08:30]  The big whoopsie.  And, now this poor guy.  You know, he's probably thinking, ah, you know, she's in charge of Alaska.  You know, I could just, I don't care what her values are.  I could just take her down.  We'll get one of those abortions.  My brother got one once.  For his girlfriend.  The problem is, no one knows her.  And, you're saying two months is plenty of time to get to know the broad.  Yeah, I think, ah, when you got a campaign that started two years ago.  With, ah, Hillary and, ah, all the rest of the clowns. 
[00:09:00]  Ah, ah, people got sick of it.  They really get sick of seeing the same people.  And, it gives you an opportunity to really start hating the candidates.  And, ah, Hillary Clinton has never been a likable person.  Ah, I think a couple of months with this woman really in the spotlight, ah, as long as she's good and holds up, I think is a good thing.  I think it's good that they didn't drag her out, ah, a lot earlier, like some of these guys that he could have picked.  That people are like, oh, this guy. 
[00:09:30]  And, ah, it clears the way where we don't have those faux pas like Joe Biden has with, ah, ah, Obama, where he's just talking crap about him at debates.  You know?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  What was it again?  He was, what did he say about Obama?  Ah, he said he doesn't have the experience.  Right.  You know, he was saying that and said that John McCain, he would be happy to run with or against John McCain.  I know you're a rah-rah Republican. 
[00:10:00]  Okay, well.  Well, not a rah-rah Republican.  I'm just trying to make the best out of this because it's either a woman or a...  Well, this is what Sarah Palin had to say.  Ah.  Only recently.  As for that VP talk all the time, I tell you, I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me.  What is it exactly that the VP does every day?  Oh, boy.  She doesn't seem to know what the job is.  Oh, that could leave a mark. 
[00:10:30]  Wow.  Well, I mean, I can answer that question and I haven't worked a day in politics in my life.  Yeah.  You pretty much prepare yourself in case the big man dies.  Right.  You then take over as the leader of the pinnacle of the free world.  See, that's your gig.  And we're stupid shock jocks and we know that.  Someone has to tell me what a vice president does every day.  I got to tell you, I, for the most part, hate politics. 
[00:11:00]  I can't get enough of this stuff this time around.  This is going to be so much fun in the next two months.  Well, either way, it's obviously going to be history making.  Either way, it's history making, right?  Yeah.  I mean, now we're sitting here on the brink of a woman vice president or a black president.  Yeah.  And one of them is going to happen.  Yeah.  But she, I think she gave a pretty good speech.  But like I said, I don't know. 
[00:11:30]  Good with the women.  Good with the moms.  There's a little controversy with some children going on.  I don't know.  Seems like she doesn't like to hold her own baby.  Yeah.  Seems like she already pawned one of the babies off onto her 14-year-old.  Off on the young daughter.  The young daughter is carrying around the latest baby.  The baby that we're being very careful with here.  Well, the baby has Down syndrome.  Yes.  I think that she's, what, 44 years old? 
[00:12:00]  Is she that old?  It's very.  43, 44?  Okay.  There's a lot of testing.  I know because little Donnie, my sister Dawn, she's in her 40s and just had a baby.  Thank God, healthy.  Healthy baby.  Just saw the baby yesterday.  You got to see the baby.  Well, now that the baby's going into kindergarten, it's about time you saw the kid.  Yeah, now it's time I see it.  Didn't she have the kid months ago?  Oh, yeah.  Kid's like old now.  You're supposed to drop everything when your sister or brother has a kid. 
[00:12:30]  No.  And you run right to the hospital immediately.  I'll tell you something.  I'm not the one that drops everything.  I understand that.  My sister and brother now, they're the ones that drop everything.  I need a new, by the way, I'm putting out an alert here.  I need a new brother and sister.  Can I have new brothers and sisters?  Because the ones that I used to have, they suck now.  Because they're no fun.  They don't hang out.  They don't do anything.  It's all about these goddamn children all the time. 
[00:13:00]  That's your...  My brother, he's gone.  He's gone, wherever he is.  I don't know.  He's constantly holding the baby and shaking the baby and going,  Dawn is constantly off with the baby.  We went over my mom and Sal's yesterday.  Beautiful day.  No one was out back on the patio like we usually do and hang out at the table.  Yeah.  Because they're all inside doing baby maintenance crap.  Dude, it is so depressing. 
[00:13:30]  I need a new brother, Joe, and a new sister, Dawn.  Because they're out of the mix now.  And you need other things.  What?  Well, you know.  Like what?  I can't blow up your spot.  You just need other things, too.  I can't think of what I need.  We'll leave that just hanging there.  I can write it down.  Rehab?  Wow.  Intervention?  Wow.  Write it down.  I got to know.  I'm just being an ass. 
[00:14:00]  But it's my job to be an ass on this show.  Because I'm just trying to think.  There's a few things that could come to mind.  I know, but...  Well, you know.  Hold on a minute.  Okay.  I need a new brother, Joe.  Oh.  No, I don't need that.  Okay.  I've had enough of those.  A what catcher?  So you don't like being an uncle to your brother and sister's kids?  It's fine.  I go out...  A lot of people confused out there. 
[00:14:30]  Anthony's brother and sister did not have sex and have a kid, by the way.  No, they did.  That's what's so screwed up about it.  They both decided late in their 40s to have kids at the same time.  Yeah.  With their spouses.  With their...  Yeah.  Significant others.  Significant others.  Yes.  Because, you know, I don't think they're going to be running on the Republican ticket because  no one's getting married there.  Wait, both aren't married, right?  Right.  Both aren't married.  Okay.  So, yeah, it's all about the baby.  And then my mother, she's gone, too. 
[00:15:00]  Because she goes over with the babies and it's constantly about the baby, baby, baby, babies.  Enough about the babies.  But she's like...  I think she loves being a grandma.  Of course she does.  She's probably saying it's about time.  But it's like...  When you kids gave her a grandchild.  Now, you know what I'm thinking?  Oh.  Thank God they waited this long to have kids.  Because I would have been rejected years ago.  I'm just tossed to the wayside now.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:15:30]  To hang out on the porch by yourself.  You know what you do?  What?  You cut them off, my friend.  Oh, they'll come back to you.  They'll come back to you quickly.  Yeah.  That's all it's about, though, is the goddamn babies are right.  Oh.  Ooh.  There it is.  So, Joe, what are you doing?  Oh.  Joe.  You want to hang out?  You want...  Oh.  What is...  Do you...  Oh. 
[00:16:00]  Joe, do you want to hang out?  Grab a...  No, I guess not.  All right.  Take it easy.  It was depressing, huh?  Oh.  Just kids.  Yeah.  I get it.  You had a baby.  Did you change one?  No.  I...  Here's my interaction with them.  Mm-hmm.  I stick my index finger out and let them take their little...  Yeah.  No.  I stick my index finger out and let them take their little baby hand, and then they grab 
[00:16:30]  onto it, and everyone goes, aw!  That's it!  Can I write something else down?  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  This is my new bit.  All right.  All right.  A little piece of jotting?  Jotting down something?  Wait a minute.  Apparently, uh...  This is, uh...  What'd you say after, uh...  No, I don't.  The baby takes a hold of your...  It's my finger.  ...of your pinky.  All right.  That's really rude. 
[00:17:00]  Uh...  Why don't we take our first break?  We're just getting started.  We gotta, you know, delve into this Sarah Palin a bit today.  Yes.  Uh...  Stupid, uh...  What's his name?  I forgot his name.  Um...  Uh...  Jerry Lewis is still doing that dumb telethon.  I realized when I turned on the TV yesterday afternoon.  Also, after the break, can we talk about that disaster movie that just was a complete bomb  over the weekend?  What was that?  Uh...  Gustav.  Oh.  I was watching this disaster movie unfold on TV.  It was made for TV. 
[00:17:30]  It was a made for TV.  Anticlimactic, yeah.  Made for TV disaster movie.  I'm like, this is gonna be good.  Yeah.  Gustav.  Nice.  What a bust.  Let me tell you, I'll have my review on that movie after the break.  877-212-018.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  What's up, everybody?  Opie and Anthony.  Back from a long weekend.  What day is today?  September 2nd.  Wow.  Here in New York, too, that weather knows how to change, huh? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, but, uh, supposed to be pretty goddamn hot today.  We're getting a little, uh, Indian summer.  89.  Yeah, one day.  It's like, usually right after Labor Day, yeah, it just gets cold.  And it sucks.  Phone number.  Gonna be very hot.  877-212-018.  Uh, yeah, so I was watching the made-for-TV disaster movie Gustav, and it was a big bust in  the end.  Yeah.  CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, they all went, uh, around-the-clock coverage with this disaster 
[00:18:30]  movie Gustav.  Sent their people down to, uh, New Orleans.  Sure.  Anderson Cooper in the French Quarter.  Oh, he should be in the Greek Quarter.  Was he in a little tight-like lycra tank top?  Yeah, so, uh, I hope I'm not accosted by a bunch of men.  He's, uh, he's CNN's future, so they put him where they knew the hurricane was definitely  not gonna hit.  Keep Anderson Cooper safe.  They really want to send Larry King right into the eye of the damn thing. 
[00:19:00]  Stand on this levee, Larry.  Yeah.  Please, Larry.  As soon as you're gone, Anderson Cooper takes over.  It's obvious to everybody.  Hey, do you think they, and remember we said that why did they rehire Larry King or re-upped  his contract?  Do you think Anderson Cooper, they wanted to keep sending out?  Like, that's why they kept Larry King and didn't?  I think it comes down to the fact that, uh, Larry King, as much as we think he's a joke  and he can't get the job done, he's probably still getting the job done and getting the  ratings.  I bet you that's what it comes down to in the end.  But Gustav, I really believe that, uh, all these news channels knew early on that this 
[00:19:30]  thing was not really gonna, uh, be the next Katrina for New Orleans.  Yeah, it was gonna veer off to the, uh, left.  Obviously, it, uh, it caused billions of dollars in damage to who-gives-a-crap, uh, type areas.  Right?  I guess unless you...  I'm serious.  They were talking about, like, the sugarcane crop's gonna be bad now, and, uh, and the  home of the Tabasco sauce got destroyed, so now we're gonna have to pay an extra couple  cents for our Tabasco sauce.  What's Tabasco going for per barrel? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know what the rate is.  And they had to shut down the oil, all that.  But, uh, you know, these hurricanes hit the Gulf, uh, almost every year.  At least one good one.  Yeah.  And they knew early on this thing was gonna veer to the left and miss New Orleans, but that  doesn't make good news for everybody.  No, it's not, uh, action-packed.  They want us to stay tuned.  They always try to sell you the sequel on the news.  Yeah.  They always, uh, it was, uh, like a big event, so they want, uh, a carbon copy of it. 
[00:20:30]  So they wanted, you know, uh, people, uh, stranded, being rescued from rooftops and, uh, levees  breaking.  Just didn't happen.  But nothing happened, really.  They evacuated the city.  They didn't even have to do that in the end.  But I, I guess, I guess you, you kind of have to.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  You gotta kinda, I think the next couple of hurricanes, they're gonna have to get everyone  out.  And then after a while, they'll just be like, ah, screw it, stay.  And it's funny, cause I, uh, I kept watching the coverage way past the fact that, you know, 
[00:21:00]  that this obviously was gonna be a bust and turn it into a tropical depression or whatever  the hell.  Yeah.  But they were still trying to keep their viewers, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,  but it's still raining.  But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, don't go anywhere.  This event isn't over yet.  There, there, there, there, there, there, there, there's one more levee we gotta check out.  Stay right there.  They love making it sound like, like the hurricane hits.  Yeah.  And it starts weakening.  And they try to come up with some scenario.  You know, one of our models, uh, have this, uh, they're models. 
[00:21:30]  One of the models have, uh, this storm actually going back out to sea, regaining strength to a  category five and slamming right into new Orleans.  Yeah.  It's just one model.  Yeah.  And I mean, literally a model is runway model.  She's dumb as dirt.  Yeah.  And the other night we're on Bourbon street, a styrofoam cup has just blown by.  The camera will follow the styrofoam cup.  It's a catastrophe here.  Styrofoam cup.  Yeah.  I think we all secretly, I really believe this.  I think we all secretly hope for the worst. 
[00:22:00]  Of course you do.  Especially if you don't live down there.  You're like, oh my God, this has to go.  This has to go up to a five and it has to hit downtown new Orleans.  It, it becomes entertainment and the news presents it that way.  And you remember watching the coverage of, uh, Katrina?  Of course.  Everyone did.  Why do you think they watched it?  It was entertaining.  Yeah.  It wasn't this big thing where you're like, I really care, which is, you know, it's unfortunate,  but as, as human beings, we just got this weird little primal thing in us where we like 
[00:22:30]  seeing other people inconvenienced or in real jams.  And as we say that, uh, Jimmy points up to the TV, channel 11, the local news station  here in New York, uh, they're doing their hurricane gust off, uh, report live this morning from  New Orleans because they sent the guy down.  They paid for the hotel and his flight.  So, you know, and it looks like someone just went, it looks like someone just went, hold  on for a minute to the lens to fog it all up because everything is very, um, very foggy 
[00:23:00]  in the lens to make it look like it's really stormy.  I was playing all, all weekend long.  I was playing.  Oh, that guy is so fired.  All the people on the news that were like, Oh, you know, I'll tell you the truth.  I don't think this is going to be a big deal after all fired.  You'll never see him on Fox news again.  Make it sound like a, it's a big deal.  Yeah, that's your job is to keep, uh, viewers tuned in to the news so they could sell their  what?  What did they used to say in the old days?  Their soap soap so they could sell their soap.  I bet they're, uh, very happy in Houston though. 
[00:23:30]  Oh yeah.  That's where, uh, all the refugees and, uh, evacuees end up going.  So I bet Houston's happy that there wasn't really a problem and everybody was able to  return to their homes.  Right.  This hurricane, uh, right through the uprights, man.  A field goal between Houston and, uh, and Norlands.  Norlands.  Yeah.  Pretty close to the, you know, the Norlands.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But there was no big, no levees broke.  I think some water went over the top of one for a little bit, a few droplets. 
[00:24:00]  And I forgot what news channel it was that, uh, told me this.  I'm not sure if it was the Republican news channel or the Democratic news channel.  Right.  Uh, but one of them was like, even near the end was like, all right, well, uh, well now  we got to worry about Hannah.  I'm like, Hannah?  Hannah Montana?  Hurricane Hannah?  She pregnant?  I blasted.  Right.  So now they want to try to get you interested in Hurricane Hannah, which is already a bust.  It's a category one and it's kind of rocking. 
[00:24:30]  Heading into colder water.  Well, it's kind of rocking and rolling around the Bahamas and it might hit where?  The Carolina coast?  It's, uh, Hannah's looking like it's going to run up the Florida coast, the East coast  and then slam into the Carolinas.  Slam and look, you're just like these news people and slam into, no, it's not slamming.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We can't get past Gustav and Geraldo's over the top dramatic stuff he was doing.  Yeah.  Let's go to Liza in Jersey.  Liza.  Hi guys.  Hi. 
[00:25:00]  Um, Geraldo was hysterically funny yesterday.  There was three things that he did.  Number one, as soon as the wind kicked up, he saw a pair of those beads that they used  for Mardi Gras, the green one, blowing down the street.  The guy chased after them, held them up to the camera and was like, look at what I just  found blowing down the street.  Where are the breasts?  Right.  I know some woman will show her breasts for these beads.  It's funny if one of those lousy books, his panic, remember that book? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, Spanish people speak English.  Good point, Geraldo.  You're right.  We're wrong.  We know nothing.  You were 100% right.  I don't know why would we think that.  Yeah.  Guys, there's, um, and there was a guy in the canal, the industrial canal where they thought  the levees were not, um, going to hold up.  Oh, yeah.  Um, he's in a life jacket fixing, um, the sewer pump thing because it was like smashing  against the building or something like that.  Yeah.  He's in a life jacket.  And, Geraldo, this is all live on camera.  Geraldo starts screaming, oh, my God, there's someone in the water. 
[00:26:00]  There's someone in the water.  Yes.  He's working.  Yeah.  He's fixing something.  You dunce.  Yeah.  He's freaking out saying that there's someone stranded in the water.  Normally, when you're stranded in the water, you're not wearing a life jacket.  Yeah.  Stop.  Or just standing there working.  Maybe you could walk out.  Yeah.  It's already on YouTube as men in water.  Uh, thank you, Liza.  I think we have that Geraldo clip.  We want to play it for everybody fast.  Yeah.  Geraldo is, uh.  Panicky Pete.  He's hilarious when it comes to this stuff. 
[00:26:30]  That this is, in fact, the industrial canal?  Yes, it is, Harris.  It is.  It is.  And to the right would be the eastern edge of the industrial canal, which would lead  you to the Lower Ninth Ward.  Right.  If memory serves, the bridge that Geraldo's up.  They wanted that Ninth Ward to flood so badly.  Oh, yeah.  They knew, though, that these levees were going to hold just how the hurricane was making  its left turn near the end there.  He serves the bridge that Geraldo's on. 
[00:27:00]  His camera was looking north to Lake Pontchartrain.  And then he's in the Lower Ninth Ward.  Let's bring him up now.  Who's in the water?  What is that?  It is a person.  There's a person there.  There's a man.  There's a man on the wing.  Man on the wing.  Is that a person?  Is that Al Capone?  I think we finally found Al.  You jerk.  What a fool he is.  Think things before you say them for a second.  It's a person.  That's a person?  It's the Loch Ness Monster. 
[00:27:30]  What is that?  What is that?  It is a person.  Where?  There's a person there along the wall.  You see right there.  God damn it.  Geraldo.  He's yelling at his camera guy.  The camera's like, leave me alone.  The camera guy is like, I can't play.  You know, why did I get a Geraldo assignment?  It's like, I can't play your game anymore.  Where, Geraldo?  No. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  Where?  Are they shooting at us again, Geraldo?  You see right there, God damn it.  Look right by that thing.  You see that ball?  Right, you see it?  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  To our viewers at home, we have not seen this video yet.  It's coming in hot to us by way of New Orleans.  You're watching it and hearing it for the first time that we are.  Yeah, that is a person.  There's clearly a person in the water.  There might be more than one.  We don't know.  It's a person. 
[00:28:30]  There's a person stranded.  Oh, is he a tool?  What a dope.  There might be more.  There might be.  Yeah, make it always worse.  Make it sound.  There's at least one person.  We have no reports or more, but what the hell?  There might be.  We're hoping it's Geraldo.  There's a person, and then all of a sudden, they're stranded with no facts.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded. 
[00:29:00]  I'm telling the cops here.  Quick, guys.  Look, there's a person in the water there.  He's telling the cops.  Oh, I've not heard this audio yet.  This is classic douchey Geraldo.  Fool.  Officers.  God, I wish he jumped in.  Oh, I'll save him.  There's a person apparently working on a pump. 
[00:29:30]  Is that what this was all about?  Yeah.  The guy was like working on something.  Yeah.  A big propane tank had broken away and was slamming against the building, and they were  actually worried it was going to explode and then tear a hole in the levee.  So the guy was doing important work, and he was on a wire.  Yeah, he was on a...  They had a wire going from him to the shore where the guys were watching him, and he had  a life jacket on.  Probably had a hard hat on and a light.  Oh, my God.  There's a man tethered safely, working responsibly. 
[00:30:00]  Officers.  Stop him.  Officers, please.  There's a man.  He's in the water, but he's on something.  It's a boat.  He's completely dry, yet in the water.  It's a cruise in the ocean.  I'm an idiot.  Is that a men at work sign?  What is that?  There's men hurling to the sky.  They're in a ship.  It says American Airlines on it.  Somebody save them.  Geraldo, what an ass.  Oh, what an ass. 
[00:30:30]  They all were desperate to make this a lot bigger than it was.  They wanted that wheelchair covered with the sheet on the side of the Astrodome.  My favorite of all time, and Danny just happens to be showing it.  Whatever dome it is.  Is the reporter in Wayne, New Jersey.  Put this up on onaradio.com.  She's doing her dramatic report about flooding, and she decided to get in a canoe.  And I'm not even kidding.  When you see the video, you'll see it for yourself.  The water cannot be more than four to six inches tops. 
[00:31:00]  And she's in a canoe, dramatically paddling as she does her shot.  And as she's dramatically talking about the flooding, two workers walk right by her.  In ankle-high water?  Yeah.  In ankle-high water.  In ankle-high water.  They're just wearing boots.  It could be the greatest example of what the media attempts to do to us on a daily basis.  That's supposed to look like she's in some real deep water.  Yeah, yeah.  And you can tell the oar is hitting the street.  Yeah.  So she can't hide the fact that these guys have groceries, and they're just walking in 
[00:31:30]  ankle-deep water in front of her canoe.  And it's a live shot, so they can't even do take two on this one.  Oh, is that fantastic?  They said northeast flooding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what they...  They show a house in the background.  It's just like a little flooded driveway.  Get me a canoe.  I have a great idea.  Do you?  All right.  Let's get back to Geraldo.  Geraldo's panicky.  Oh, my God.  There's a bunch of people drowning.  They're going back and forth.  It's the Olympics.  Oh, they're swimming.  Someone save those people. 
[00:32:00]  They're trying to lynch that man.  He's wearing medals.  Yeah.  It's Michael Phelps.  Yeah.  Right.  Old panicky Geraldo.  He really is an ass.  That's a racial attacker piling on that black man.  That's a Giants game.  Oh, my God.  That's a Giants game.  Football season story, Geraldo.  Here we go.  Back to Geraldo.  Man in the water.  Let's hear him.  There's a man.  I'm telling the cops here.  Quick, guys.  Look.  There's a person in the water there. 
[00:32:30]  Shut up.  Right there.  A person in the life track.  Do you see him?  There's a person in the...  He's swimming.  Oh, he's got a lifeline.  He's got a lifeline.  He's got a lifeline.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right.  They get him safely on board?  Is he safely on board?  Looks like he's safely on board.  It was unbelievable. 
[00:33:00]  It was a man in the water with a life jacket on.  And I don't know whether he had voluntarily jumped in to do some emergency maneuver.  Maneuver?  Maneuver!  No, he was swept off his couch in a life jacket with a line attached to it.  He all of a sudden turned into Chief Brody.  Shark!  Shark!  Get out of the water!  Oh, Geraldo is a dick. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, my God.  Is he stupid.  He rules.  I can't tell if he jumped in the water.  How else do you get in the water with a life jacket?  A life jacket.  Exactly.  Doing some kind of maneuver.  What?  Just my luck.  I fell in this water and there's a life jacket floating right next to me.  And a lanyard to a bunch of people on shore.  Voluntarily jumped in to do some emergency maneuver or whether or not he was swept off  the deck of that tugboat. 
[00:34:00]  They got a lifeline to him.  He is back on board the Kent, the Army Corps of Engineers tugboat now.  But it is ferocious and quite extraordinary.  Oh, my God.  That was unbelievable.  All right.  Let's get back.  What was unbelievable about it?  You're actually quite believable.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was the furthest from unbelievable.  Geraldo's dumb reaction was unbelievable.  Yeah.  He was doing emergency work.  It was funny.  No, he was just like painting a little duct work.  Right.  Just think of the intent that I'm doing anyway. 
[00:34:30]  Busy work.  Doesn't let a hurricane stop him from painting and doing yard work.  We certainly abuse words in this society.  Unbelievable.  What would be unbelievable is if a fish was just kind of walking down Bourbon Street.  Right.  That's unbelievable, literally.  Yes.  A man in a life jacket in the water is not that unbelievable.  What do you tell these police officers?  Yeah.  They're laughing.  Why are they laughing?  Yeah.  At you.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Geraldo was panicking like Big A when he runs out of dipping sauce for his calamari at 
[00:35:00]  F.H.  Reilly's.  What a, what a, oh, whatever.  Poor Geraldo.  Yeah.  Always in the middle of it and always just being a douche.  He's always wrong.  Yeah.  He's never had the scoop.  Well, how does he have a job?  He does everything wrong.  Everything wrong.  When he gave out the position of the troops during the invasion, the Iraqi invasion, unbelievable. 
[00:35:30]  He just, in the dirt, he's carving out, here's the, you know, Marines are going to be coming  in from this way.  And they're like, hey, Geraldo, dummy.  Yeah.  We're not on cable access, you idiot, for the local college.  Yeah.  This is being broadcast for Al Jazeera, dummy.  Yeah.  This is being broadcast all over the world.  We got to replay this later.  Oh, that's great.  We didn't do this justice.  Panicky Geraldo.  We need another play of that in a little bit.  Yeah.  Let it soak in a little. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  There's a person.  There's a person.  Right.  There's a person in the water.  And then Shepard Smith almost was so fired over the weekend.  Shep?  What did Shep do?  Shepard Smith is constantly saying things that he should be fired over.  Yeah.  He's dropped the C-bomb a couple of times on his show, and then he just chuckles about it.  He's dropped the F-bomb.  He's talked about self-pleasuring with certain celebrities. 
[00:36:30]  He just talked about oral favors with J-Lo.  Mm-hmm.  He constantly trips up and curses on the air.  Well, this was a near miss.  A near miss?  Take a listen to this.  Not to mention the potential for flooding here in New Orleans, because New Orleans, you  know, impossible to forget, is a city that's in a bowl and below sea level.  Well, the pumps are working well now, but Mayor Nagar, Mayor Nagin warns, don't come home.  Whoa!  Pew!  You heard that one whizzed by your ear, didn't you, Shep? 
[00:37:00]  Whoa!  Whoa!  That was a close one.  There's a man on the unemployment line.  There's a man on the unemployment line.  I believe it's Shepard Smith.  Whoa!  Mayor, he said Nagar.  Yeah, we'll put that in the near miss category.  Yes, wow.  The FAA is going to have to look into that one.  That came very close.  Nagar.  Woo!  Well, I guess it all depends on where he lives and what his accent would be. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, here's he.  Hey, we spent money on sending Sam Roberts to Minnesota through this whole mess.  Oh, right.  And he's ready to board a plane.  Sam?  Yeah.  Primetime Sam Roberts at the Republican National Convention.  Hi, Sam.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  You got anything for us?  Well, I just got to visit the bathroom that Larry Craig got busted in here in the Minnesota  airport.  Oh, that's exciting.  Please take pictures. 
[00:38:00]  Is there graffiti on the wall or anything?  Larry Craig was here, any of that stuff?  No graffiti, but I hung out in the bathroom like a creep until it was empty and started  taking pictures of the stalls.  And did you sit there and tap your feet?  No, I didn't actually sit down on the stall.  You should have sat down, tapped your foot, waited for a psst.  Hey, do you have time to go back into that stall and do what's the haps live from the  Larry Craig stall?  That would be hilarious.  Yeah, sure.  And you just knock on the stall and just start uncomfortable conversations with the guy 
[00:38:30]  next to you.  It doesn't have to be of the sexual nature, just any type of conversation.  Let me head back there and see if anyone's in there right now.  All right.  It's a little early, I guess, for a lot of people.  We sent Sam up to the national convention there.  That's kind of a bust because of this gust off.  But now I think it's going to be a full out party for the rest of the week.  Now that gust off is, you know, wasn't as bad as people thought, right? 
[00:39:00]  Mm-hmm.  Sam, you talked to the protesters too up there?  Yeah, there were still a bunch of protesters.  A few thousand people showed up, even though there were no politicians to protest against.  Yeah.  They were all very outspoken.  Unfortunately, there weren't very many 9-11 truth people.  I was counting on that, but there were 85.  But I did get to speak to some people about...  I talked to one guy who was informing me when it was appropriate to use the word queer and not. 
[00:39:30]  Oh.  And when is it appropriate?  Oh, when you talk about learning.  Oh, I don't know that.  Leaky-leaky.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think he actually got kind of pissed.  Yeah.  Because I asked him if McCain was queer for picking a woman vice president.  Mm-hmm.  People don't...  Barry didn't understand your FAA comment.  I thought it was brilliant.  Barry.  Oh, it's a near miss.  A near miss.  The FAA has to look into every near miss out there.  Yeah.  And Shepard Smith had a near miss with the old N-word. 
[00:40:00]  I wasn't saying it was a brilliant joke.  I kind of liked it.  You know, it has its faults.  Yeah.  But it was just, you know, a throwaway line.  Thanks for commenting on it.  This is good?  Yeah.  Oh, I got more Geraldo stuff.  Whatever, Sam.  We'll see you when you get back to New York.  You've got a free trip.  Who gives a crap what you got up there?  Yeah, I hope you have good audio.  We'll see you tomorrow.  There it goes.  Go tap your foot and get arrested.  You rock.  We just paid for that, by the way.  Yeah.  We paid to have Sam fly to Minnesota. 
[00:40:30]  We put him up in a hotel, flew him back, and that's what we got.  We suck.  He will be back with some type of tape, some type of digital audio.  I think he did what's the haps with the protester.  Yes, you're right.  The Geraldo thing happened around 11, 11.30 yesterday morning.  So every hour, Fox made whoever the new anchor was play this clip and comment on it.  So it gets down to Britt Hume's show.  Comes out of commercial, goes right into Geraldo.  He makes one quick comment right after it. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, he does.  Let me tell you about Britt Hume.  Britt Hume doesn't play.  No.  He's one of these guys like, you know what?  I'm not going to go with the outrageous stuff.  Serious guy?  Yeah, he's as serious as they get on Fox News Channel.  Sure.  So I'm assuming that he is going to have none of this Geraldo BS.  Nope.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  I'm telling the cops here.  Quick, guys. 
[00:41:30]  Look, there's a person in the water there.  Right there, a person in the life track.  Do you see him?  There's a person in the...  He's swimming.  Oh, he's got a lifeline.  He's got a lifeline.  He's got a lifeline.  Oh, my God.  All right.  They get him safely on board?  Is he safely on board? 
[00:42:00]  Looks like he's safely on board.  Safely.  Geraldo Rivera, where the action is.  Geraldo Rivera, where the action is.  Nah.  He's sitting there.  He knows the video's done, but he's just looking at the camera, like, in disgust.  Then he goes, he's where the action is.  Then he goes something else.  Never talks about it again.  Because he's pissed that the bosses said, look, we want to play this clip and sensationalize it.  Man in the water.  That's my car.  That's my car.  The Tan Sierra.  Tan Sierra. 
[00:42:30]  That's my car.  Why'd they cut off the word is when they...  Did you notice that?  Where the action is.  Where the action is.  I think that's how it played out, right?  Because right when he said is, they do that sound effect transition to go to something else.  Yeah.  To alert you that there's something even more important.  Every story is something important at this point.  Remember the Fox News alert used to mean, holy crap.  Oh, yeah.  They do it all the time now.  9.8 earthquake somewhere now.  It's like...  Opening statement in traffic violations. 
[00:43:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  Thank you.  People will not drop the FAA thing.  No.  They're like, shouldn't the FCC be looking into it?  No.  That's why the FAA works.  Because there was a near miss.  There was no violation there.  Oh, my God.  NTSB would have also been good.  Yes.  Yes.  Sure.  Certainly.  They think that you messed up FAA and FCC.  Yes.  You did not.  No.  You meant FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:43:30]  Because it was a plain reference about a near miss.  Of course.  See, you understand.  Certainly do.  Steven asks from Bayshore,  Grandma, it's my bad mustache.  I'll save you.  Puts his mustache in the water.  Is he safely on board?  He's safely on board.  Is that Jesus Christ?  Is he walking on the water?  I think I found Jesus Christ.  Oh, God.  They just showed our vice presidential GOP candidate.  Sarah Palin? 
[00:44:00]  With that daughter carrying that baby.  Well.  She don't want to be, what is she, not want to be photographed with the baby or something?  I guess not.  It's the 14-year-old's job to carry around the...  Carry around the baby with the Down syndrome.  Carry around the dud.  You know...  Jesus Christ.  I knew this was...  We're a comedy show, and we're trying to make jokes, people.  Now, they...  Oh, see, that's what I was getting at earlier when I started talking about children and stuff. 
[00:44:30]  Apparently, she's 44 years old, having a baby, which is high risk.  Can we save this for after the break?  Certainly.  Because I know how you get, and it's going to be good, and it's going to go for about 10 minutes,  and then we're going to screw up the whole radio show.  All right.  So, Anthony's thoughts on Sarah Palin after the break, right?  Mm-hmm.  Because I really...  You're the Republican in the room.  I want to really know what you're thinking here.  Oh, boy.  Because I think you're torn on this one.  There's a woman on the ticket!  There's a woman on the ticket! 
[00:45:00]  More on Sarah Palin after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out.  What do we got?  What do we got?  What do we got?  What movie was number one at the box office?  Tropic Thunder again?  Yeah, Tropic Thunder.  Wow.  Three weeks in a row or something like that?  Three weeks in a row.  Dark Knight passed a half a billion dollars.  Second movie to do so, right?  Wow.  What was the other one?  Titanic. 
[00:45:30]  Okay.  Oh, they beat Spider-Man already?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I went and saw it again the other night.  Dark Knight, I was alone and bored and depressed.  At midnight in the IMAX.  Christian Bale sucks even more than I remembered him second.  Really?  He is going to ruin the France.  He is terrible.  With this voice thing, is that what really got you again?  Because now watching it a second time.  You threw the best you could at him.  And Gotham responded. 
[00:46:00]  Shut up.  Oh, God.  That bad?  Stink.  Is it really that bad?  It's embarrassing.  I was like...  I was watching him and Ledger go back and forth in the police station.  Gotham has a better soul than you.  And Ledger's doing all this great acting.  And this idiot is just making a scratchy voice.  It's like, what are you, eight years old trying to convince your mom that it's someone else?  I'm a burglar.  Give me an ice pop and I'll leave.  Give me ice cream. 
[00:46:30]  Sounds like he has a voice box or something, right?  He's terrible.  It's terrible.  The problem is they wanted to have some kind of effect on his voice.  But it's so different than everybody.  You know what I mean?  It takes you out of the movie a little bit.  It stinks.  But it's partially his dumb acting, too.  Because watching his lip, his lip kind of goes up.  He's got like a lisp.  He's got some kind of a lisp.  It's very subtle, but it's there.  Oh, it's horrendous watching it again.  Every time he talked, it ruined the movie for me. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  I was like, God, this is great.  It sucks.  Sucks.  Stop talking, Batman.  Just point.  What about Heath Ledger?  Great the second time around?  Absolutely.  Even better, right?  He started really looking at the little nuances he did with his character and stuff.  It's just fantastic.  I mean, everyone says it.  You kind of want to be a different guy and go, that was only okay.  But it was just great.  Just amazing.  Sure.  They do comparisons to Nicholson's Joker, and I love Nicholson, to his on YouTube.  And Nicholson's is just corny now. 
[00:47:30]  It was kind of dark when he did it.  Oh, yeah.  Just hokey.  That's not fair, though, because when they first did the whole Batman thing, they were  still going with that cartoony angle.  So I think Nicholson played it right for back in the day.  He probably did.  But then they updated the franchise.  They made it darker and all that.  So now Heath Ledger makes him look silly.  It was still corny.  They look in the perfect suit.  This town, he's an enema.  All right, Jeff.  I mean, I, of course, love Nicholson, but he was okay as the Joker. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Speaking of voices, we lost in a world.  Oh, yes.  In a world guy died overnight.  In a world.  In a world.  Yeah.  In a world.  Yeah.  Deep voice guy.  Deep voice guy.  It was the guy that, you know, the whole Ramon bit was kind of based on and came from.  That's right.  Yeah.  For the people that linger longer.  That's right.  Yeah.  The voice guy.  What was his name?  Don LaFontaine?  Don LaFontaine.  Died at the age of 68.  He was in a world guy.  And I guess he had a collapsed lung. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Something tells me to have that voice.  He might have smoked.  Sure.  I'm just speculating.  A lot of the voice guys smoke.  Yeah.  They do.  Good pipes.  Gives you that gravelly voice.  Deep voice.  You got to smoke camels without the filters.  Yeah.  Drink bourbon for lunch.  Sacrificed themselves for their trade.  But I guess he quit smoking and then the smoking got to him, you know, a bunch of years  later.  Yeah.  I think he quit like 20 some odd years ago or something, but yeah, we lost in a world guy. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, God needed a voice over me.  That's right.  Yeah, mate.  And the Jerry Lewis telethon set another record and I don't know how we say it every year.  Enough already.  We're not going to cure this one.  Let's move on.  Let's move on.  Let's get health care for the country.  Let's do the health care telethon.  Sixty five million dollars.  Sixty five million.  You know, you could insure a few people.  Yeah.  You know, enough with this telethon.  I think I think all these corporations, they don't want to be the one like, Jerry, it's 
[00:49:30]  been 43 years.  We want to back out.  Yeah.  They're kind of stuck.  They're stuck.  And he I didn't even know the telethon was on.  Everyone forgets about it.  It's not advertised at all anymore.  No, it's it's for, I believe, 45 minutes on Channel nine.  Now, it used to be it used to be this big marathon where it was like, oh, my God, look, Jerry is  staying awake.  He's been awake so long.  Now it's on for a few hours. 
[00:50:00]  It's and and they make they top their last year every year.  What do they make?  Sixty five million.  Sixty five million.  Breaking another record.  And like I've said, it's these corporate sponsors that just can't get out of it anymore.  Right.  This poor son of a bitch has to go up with this big check and go, yeah, Jerry, on behalf  of the McDonald's Corporation, we give this check for this check for ten million dollars 
[00:50:30]  to your kids.  I think I think there's like some high powered rifles backstage and corporate guys just line  up with their big checks.  Bring your checks.  Oh, you will walk out there with your big check or else.  And they probably do.  And there was so many viewers.  It was great advertising for your company.  Exactly.  Relations.  Now, no one watches that.  No one watches.  I had it on for I it had to be a couple of minutes just to see. 
[00:51:00]  Jerry never shows his face anymore.  Yeah, it's like all kinds of co-hosts all around the country.  And then they had some guy coming out to sing in a wheelchair and he had Duchenne's muscular  dystrophy.  What's the Duchenne?  I don't know.  Is that the bad kind?  Duchenne's.  They're all bad, but there's a few that are really bad.  He's in a wheelchair singing and he's holding on to the mic stand and I couldn't tell what  was his arms or the mic stand.  Oh, it was horrible.  But he had a pretty good voice.  But that's all I could see.  I was like, who is this guy? 
[00:51:30]  Who would sit and watch this drivel?  All right.  You know what?  I got to give myself some demerits today.  What?  Stunt brain, you got a job.  You got to remind me later.  Today would have been the day to do it, but I think the telethon will still be a little  bit hot tomorrow.  We'll call it lukewarm tomorrow.  Yeah.  Back in the day when I was in Rochester, I used to do some stuff for the telethon.  I was on TV doing the local coverage and I actually found the videotape recently.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:52:00]  And I played it for my fiance.  Come on.  I got to see it.  And I'm surprised I'm still getting married.  What was her response to it?  Did you think it was great?  It was not good.  It was not good.  I think it was great.  Wow.  You're fantastic.  Let's just put it this way.  They thought it would be a good idea to put me up on a 15-foot ladder and I...  Why?  And I couldn't come off the ladder until...  Don't say it.  No.  Okay.  Don't...  Don't...  No.  No.  No.  If you say it, it's real. 
[00:52:30]  Just let me speculate until you climbed down the ladder.  You couldn't get off the ladder until...  Until...  You climbed down.  Until the shot was over.  Well, there was a number we needed to reach.  No.  No.  And everybody was cheering and saying, go Opie, go, as I sat on top of the ladder.  And then they gave me the signal that I was allowed to climb down the ladder because  they made their number for that hour.  I saw this tape recently and I actually buried it in a box in my closet. 
[00:53:00]  But now I think I got to throw myself under the bus tomorrow.  It is awful.  Why tomorrow?  Why can't...  It's 7-10.  Why can't...  Where is it?  Hop in a cab.  You live very close to me.  I need it now.  You can be back here before...  Honestly, it would be really hard for Kenny to find.  I'm not kidding.  I buried it.  I was so embarrassed.  What did you have?  Dignity dystrophy?  Jesus.  Bill from Waterford.  Opie, was there a noose at the top of the ladder?  Yeah.  MD.  Monumental douche. 
[00:53:30]  Steven asked from Bayshore, Opie, did you go on as Spuds Cripply?  Really?  You should have ended the segment like Brooks did in Shawshank.  It is awful.  Wow.  Tomorrow.  There's a tease for tomorrow.  What were you saying?  Do we have a VHS recorder still?  We'll buy one.  Oh, please.  All right.  What were you saying?  Were you saying we got to...  Were you rooting them on?  Like, come on, we got to raise money.  Come on, guys.  Send it in.  Call in.  I was singing Guns N' Roses because I was big into the Guns N' Roses in the late 80s. 
[00:54:00]  No, you were not.  I think this was late 80s, maybe 1990.  I agree with the boys.  We should get this this morning.  There's a VHS deck right behind you that's wired into the board.  Send somebody.  They got to get it.  I got to hear this today.  Is your girl there?  Because Kenny can have her grab it.  Honestly, I'm trying to think how easy it is.  I'll figure it out during the break.  Maybe we'll have it by the end of the show.  Dude, you don't understand.  That's gold.  We should have that.  It really is gold.  I didn't really want to bring it to everyone's attention. 
[00:54:30]  I'm thinking, ah, Labor Day telethon, ah.  But now that the telethon has just passed, I used to work with those little effers.  I can't imagine what that would be like.  I'm here on top of this ladder, and I had a high Opie voice.  Did you throw it to Jerry?  I threw it to the seasoned anchorman.  Just throwing yourself off the ladder.  Yeah, no kidding.  I had to give up on the whole muscular dystrophy thing because, believe it or not, the Oster has a bit of a heart. 
[00:55:00]  And I got to know these little effers.  Oh, did you?  And they were dying all around me.  I couldn't take it anymore.  Yeesh.  But I did the telethon for a couple years, and I got a videotape.  I can't wait.  A local TV.  I'm going to stay up on this ladder until we reach $100,000.  I sang Welcome to the Jungle because then I was doing like Guns N' Roses karaoke for pledges and stuff.  On top of the ladder?  Not on top of the ladder. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, oh.  No.  Was the anchor going like, ha, ha, ha, thank you, Opie.  He effing hated me.  Really?  Hated me.  Wait till you see this tape.  Oh.  All right, I'll bring it in tomorrow.  No, no, no.  I don't like it.  This is necessary today.  This is imperative.  I think today's a better day.  What do you think, guys?  Oh, absolutely.  If you can please, please.  I'll give something for the peeps tomorrow.  Oh, we'll come up with something else. 
[00:56:00]  For tomorrow.  We need it now.  Who are you calling?  Kenny.  He's not here yet.  He goes to my place all the time to grab stuff.  I can get something.  I don't know if there might be a shot at it.  But at the very...  We'll try to get it for tomorrow at the very least.  All right.  But this telethon, what's your thoughts?  It's over?  Yeah, yeah.  There's no...  Like Jimmy said, these guys, the corporations do this for the advertising, and now no one  watches.  No.  So...  They had big celebrities, though.  This year?  Yeah, they had John Panette. 
[00:56:30]  Nice guy.  I met him a couple times, but wow, they were pulling out all the stops for the celebrities.  But why not have somebody...  The telethon's not cool enough for the big-name celebrities.  See, that's...  No.  That's what kind of people those people are.  The telethon is something that is nostalgic, and it should be gone and remembered. 
[00:57:00]  Because back, I guess, in the 70s, when it was really kind of at its peak as far as  popularity goes, they'd have celebrities that were kind of from, like, Vegas.  They'd have, like, this stupid...  Who's that stupid couple?  The guy with the jowls and his old-ass wife.  Edie?  Steve and Edie would come on.  Jerry, we're going to sing a little song.  So send your contributions.  And they'd change the words to, like, some bad Vegas show tune. 
[00:57:30]  It was all old-school Vegas.  Oh, horrible.  And let's give it up for Norm Crosby.  Hey, Norm Crosby will come out and do some jokes because he acts like he's deaf or something.  And then they'll bring out...  You know, Sammy would come out, and Jerry and Sammy Davis Jr. would do a little interaction  with each other.  He'd call them a...  Oh, I should have had the beep there.  Oops.  Good thing I didn't hit a blazing saddle, sir.  Oops.  They'd sing a song called, Let's Help This Little Embarrassment. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, but no one wants to say it's over.  I'm sorry for this one.  Yeah.  This disease has gotten a lot of attention over the years.  A lot of attention and money.  43, 44 years, something like that?  Maybe it's just one of those things, like you say, some of the baby turtles don't make  it.  And all the other diseases sitting on the sidelines just going, put me in, coach.  Put me in.  What about me?  Play me.  Play me for a while on TV.  Yeah.  Put a bunch of people to give a bunch of money to this cause. 
[00:58:30]  It's a bad spot to be in.  I know there's a lot of people out there that are listening to our voices that know this  muscular dystrophy thing, you know, firsthand.  But still, you know, 43, 44 years is enough.  Let's move on to another disease.  Let's see if we can have a little more success at that.  Yeah.  It's kind of like toe fungus rotting something else.  Jerry had a huge announcement years and years and years ago, and he teased it for the telethon  and said, I have a huge breakthrough announcement, and everyone's waiting like, oh, my God, there's 
[00:59:00]  a cure.  Oh, my God.  And that's when he said, we have isolated the Duchenne's genetic code.  And you're like, what?  Waited for that?  And millions and millions of dollars, and you've isolated some kind of thing that they've done  nothing with, apparently.  Oh, you know.  Get up on the ladder.  Does he have a kid with muscular dystrophy?  Like, what made him get into this?  I forgot.  It's been so long.  And there's been urban legends and stuff as to why he does this and why he's so dedicated. 
[00:59:30]  Well, didn't he say that it was because of the fact he used to make those crazy faces,  and someone came up to him and said, you know, when you walk funny like that and make those  faces, you're mocking the kids with muscular dystrophy.  Holy mother of God.  And then he dedicated himself to this in 1966 was the first telethon.  I'm going to handle the criticism, Joe.  You know how many vacations you blew on this?  That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Why? 
[01:00:00]  Hey, we got to do a little mopping around here because we were supposed to talk about Sarah  Palin.  Oh, yeah.  She's not going anywhere.  Someone's calling me out because it is a Gustav or Gustav.  I heard it both ways this week.  Gustav.  Someone is calling me out saying I'm mispronouncing that and Palin or Palin.  Is it Palin or Palin?  I don't know.  Honestly, I think it might be Palin.  It looks more like Palin than Palin.  Right?  I don't know.  Old corroded womb.  I think it's Palin.  Like the Python guy. 
[01:00:30]  Once again, we are a comedy show just attempting to make people laugh today.  Palin.  Palin?  We're going with Palin?  That's what we're getting.  Palin.  Palin and Gustav.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I was born in this country.  So, you know, Gustav is good, too.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  Gustav.  Gustav.  Really fast.  We'll do this. 
[01:01:00]  David Duchovny in rehab for sex addiction.  This hit while we were away, too, right?  It's a porno addiction, actually.  Not even like a sex addiction, because they're saying he hadn't cheated on his wife, Tia Leone.  That means we all should be in rehab, right?  Yeah.  So, what was he doing that we aren't doing that he has to go into rehab?  Jimmy, you want to enlighten us on that addiction?  Well, probably spending lots.  Like, let's just say last night I was trying to get someone to send me naked pictures.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:01:30]  And let's just say that two hours later at 2.30 in the morning, 2.40, I finally go to bed after having seen a nude photo and repainted my shirt and my back hurt.  Yeah.  You know, hours wasted.  Mm-hmm.  Hours.  Not wasted, but you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, but it's hours.  Irrational amount of time spent.  Yeah.  So, that's what he was doing, apparently, was just...  Because everyone thought he was, like, getting hookers and, like, sneaking off and he's married and all that.  We love this David Duchovny, too. 
[01:02:00]  He's done our show a couple times.  He loves being here.  And I love his Californication, and he plays like a sex addict in Californication.  Yeah.  That's probably why he plays it so well.  It turns out he was just online too long.  The, yeah.  The porno stuff, it said he was involved in all kinds of internet chat rooms and stuff and things like that.  And I'm thinking, you know, I don't think we should take complete credit for his addiction,  but when he sits in that chair, he does have a fine view of my PalTalk screen here. 
[01:02:30]  That's great.  And he must have saw that and just went like, oh, boy.  Ooh, that's some pay dirt right there.  He must have been sitting there just thinking, I just want to, like, rub one out.  Yeah.  And they have to go out and try to find Uncle Anthony's allowance for him.  You ass.  Wow. 
[01:03:00]  Goddamn, Jimmy.  It would be great if he came out and said that, you know, he blames it all on us.  That would be hilarious.  Yeah.  This show on the Jews, he blames it right.  All right.  Let's go into lockdown mode so we can do a little Sarah Palin.  Palin.  Palin.  Yeah.  Palin.  Palin.  Palin.  Palin.  Palin.  Palin.  Yeah, let's go with Sarah Palin.  Let's really mess up everybody.  We want to get Anthony's thoughts on it. 
[01:03:30]  Yes.  And the hurricane, by the way, is Gustave.  And let's not forget Sarah Palin.  Palin.  Palin.  Palin.  It's actually Palin with no U.  Said this.  As for that VP talk all the time, I tell you, I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me.  What is it exactly that the VP does every day?  Well, we'll get Anthony's thoughts next. 
[01:04:00]  That's great.  Open Anthony.  A little later, we've got to get into a couple of things.  Some 100-year-old woman bought it over the weekend on Long Island.  Not by natural causes, by the way.  Let's start a look at her 76-year-old daughter.  I guess somebody shot the 100-year-old woman.  Shot her.  Couldn't you just wait another week or two?  This woman wasn't going anywhere. 
[01:04:30]  I think that was the problem.  Maybe the daughter kind of...  Let's get that story for the next break.  And then a bunch of women talking about what they would do if they had a penis for a day.  Really?  That's got to be some terrific talk.  Oh.  Anyone else?  Yes, Jimmy.  Speaking of penis, I was reading a...  There's a new cowboy book coming out about the Cowboys of the early 90s.  And I forget what it's called, man, but it looks really good.  It's like all the dirt about Michael Irvin doing drugs, apparently, or whatever it was he was doing. 
[01:05:00]  And they said Charles Haley, who was one of my favorite Cowboys ever.  I'm a 94, defensive player, had, let's just say, was very fond of taking his penis out in front of everybody.  He was like a real...  He was an animal.  He was like there was something wrong with him.  And they said he would berate other players' wives.  Like, maybe not with the wives were there, but with his penis out in the locker room.  Really?  The greatest, yeah.  He would just say, stand by players and do really inappropriate things, not far from the players' heads. 
[01:05:30]  I cannot wait to get a hold of this book.  He must have had a...  Yes, he did.  Charles Haley was very blessed, they said.  Yeah.  Which is why he was always showing off.  It would be hilarious if he had like a pinky.  Yeah.  No, he didn't.  But had the attitude.  Let's just say the myth was true.  Okay.  Is this the greatest team ever?  Is that what it is, called the greatest team ever, coming out next week?  Oh, really?  I do not believe it.  Who's right?  Yeah, boys will be boys.  Boys will be boys. 
[01:06:00]  Who wrote the book?  Do we know?  Whatever.  Okay.  That sounds like it's going to be a good read.  Yeah.  We got to get into Sarah Palin again.  Palin.  What do you got on the potential vice president there?  Well, I think it was a good move on McCain's part.  Do you really?  Yeah, because now...  Because I know when it hit, you and I were texting back and forth.  Yeah.  We were having quite a chuckle over things.  Because if someone was able to get our text messages, we would be fired. 
[01:06:30]  Well, probably, yeah.  We still could do the type of radio show to each other.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What did you write?  Oh, well...  What did it rhyme with?  Let's just put it this way.  At one point, I go to Anthony.  I think it would be a good idea for us to take off until this election is decided.  Yeah.  Until she goes away or is vice president.  There's just too much dirt on this one.  Wait, was it something like this?  We're either going to have a...  Or a...  Who pumped out a...  Well...  Yes, a lot...  A lot of these... 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was...  Yeah, she's...  The first thing, right when they announced it, that's when we were texting, and it's like,  hmm...  You were like, oh, my God, they just handed the election to Obama.  And a lot of people said that.  Yeah.  And that's where I know I'm stupid, because they can't be that stupid that they just would  throw some, quote, unexperienced broad at you like this.  Broad.  That has a 70-year-old daughter that's five months pregnant. 
[01:07:30]  Knocked up.  Just a little too crazy.  Yeah.  Because your first thought is, oh, I guess they really want the Democrats in there for  four years.  But...  And then the longer you kind of heard her talk when she had a little accept the nomination  speech, you realize, all right, she's a good speaker.  She's got an annoying, kind of, eh, screechy voice.  Kind of.  That's got to go.  A little rough.  Yeah.  And, um...  I don't know, it's obviously a calculated move that he went with a woman. 
[01:08:00]  Going with the, uh, for the female vote?  Because now we're looking at, it's either going to be a woman or a black guy in the White  House, or, you know, in the, uh, wherever the hell the vice president lives.  Where's the vice president live?  Down the street.  Down the street, right?  Yeah, they have their own residence down there in Washington.  Exactly.  Right across the street.  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, uh, so it's almost like this race versus sex thing that's going on now. 
[01:08:30]  Dude, there's a whole man versus woman thing played out on Fox News and CNN.  You want to have some good viewing.  Sit down with a nice beer or cocktail and, uh, watch what's being played out.  Yeah.  The man versus the woman on TV, it's hilarious.  Yeah, people kind of wanted to do that with the black and white thing you were saying.  I truly believe that.  But you can't do that in this country, but you could still do man versus woman.  And now Biden's going to look like he's beating up on a woman if he really goes in for, for  an attack and especially a woman. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  She's got a family.  She's, uh, uh, has a handicapped child that she's got to deal with.  So how do you attack this woman if you're a politician and not look like a bad guy?  That's going to be, that might've been a very strategic move on, uh, McCain's part.  Let me get somebody in here who they can't really tear apart.  They could, they could get her experience, uh, and say she doesn't have enough experience,  but then you're throwing it right back at them at what they were saying about Obama without 
[01:09:30]  the experience.  And there's a lot of people that they have to be on the fence as far as the inexperience  thing goes with Obama.  Yeah.  And that kind of, this kind of like, there's a washout now.  You can't look at Obama's inexperience as much.  Well, he's the president.  Oh, I know.  That's why I said as much.  Yeah.  But look, McCain's getting pieces of his body, uh, cut off from every other week.  And, and then, and what do they say?  She's a heartbeat away from being the president of the United States.  That's got to scare people.  That got Obama in trouble.  Somebody from his campaign said that. 
[01:10:00]  And then he had to kind of distance himself from that remark.  Yeah.  About the heartbeat away just because, you know.  Yeah.  Well, it's accurate.  It's very accurate.  Yeah.  I mean, look though, uh, you know, Cheney's been, uh, old and, and on death's door, uh,  according to everybody.  And he's been in office for, uh, you know, eight years.  Dying in the same heart attack for 20 years.  20 years.  How do you know he's still alive, my friends?  That's true.  They could do some things in this country.  Robotics.  Illuminati.  Right.  Illuminati.  Sure. 
[01:10:30]  But this, uh, now, now with the pregnant daughter and the way they presented it was  just hysterical.  We are so happy that our daughter came to us and gave us the fantastic news that we are  going to become grandparents.  It's like, well, I somehow doubt it went like that.  Yeah.  She's in high school and got knocked up out of wedlock.  I don't think they were.  This is great.  And are we all looking for a little honesty?  Like most parents out there would not say this is a good thing. 
[01:11:00]  They'd be like, oh, yes, we're going to have to raise our, our, our daughter's kid.  Well, this whole story came, came to the forefront yesterday because the blogosphere was saying  that, uh, maybe the daughter had the four month old child.  They were speculating that Sarah Palin did not give birth and covering up the kids, um, early  pregnancy.  But that couldn't be possible.  That was, that was a, uh, liberal blog site or something.  The Daily Cause.  Yeah.  And they were saying that, yes, the daughter gave birth to the kid that has Down syndrome 
[01:11:30]  and they were hiding it and got a big scandal.  A liberal blogger.  I mean, it's hard to say they're not reliable.  This is what we got on the pregnancy thing.  Sarah Palin, the new vice presidential candidate.  They're saying Palin.  Palin.  No.  Palin.  Palin.  Palin.  It's Palin.  I've told you.  Yeah.  We're going with Palin on this show.  Her 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, has confirmed that she is now five months pregnant. 
[01:12:00]  Bristol, uh, apparently plans to marry her boyfriend.  She is not married at the time.  Again, five months pregnant.  And sources in the McCain campaign are now telling reporters that John McCain knew of  the pregnancy before he tapped Bristol's mom.  The governor of Alaska said it had to be his running mate and he did not feel in any way  that that was a disqualifying event.  Hmm.  Wow.  But, uh, we were saying earlier, and, and had a great take on this. 
[01:12:30]  This kid doesn't want to be married to the mama.  No, this is your shotgun wedding.  It's some high school hockey player.  Who openly admits he's a redneck that doesn't want to be a father.  He fishes.  He doesn't even want to be married.  Yeah.  Hunts and, uh, apparently doesn't use protection.  Yeah.  I love this kid.  He says, yeah.  I think the government came a knock in and said, you will be marrying this, uh, girl.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  We really need you to marry, uh, this, this girl. 
[01:13:00]  You got pregnant.  Yeah.  But I don't want, I see my life as it.  No, no, no, no, no.  You are going to marry this girl.  Let's show you what really happened to JFK before you really make your decision.  Here it is.  Son.  He must be a great hunter.  I mean, what a shot.  Yeah.  He blasted one right there.  He probably doesn't mind marrying her now.  He could be marrying the daughter of the vice president.  He probably was like, I'll be happy to, I'd marry her.  Or just some daughter of a woman from Alaska. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Cause these VPs don't make it.  Yeah.  The VPs that don't make it, they go away real quick.  Oh yeah.  And you never hear from them again.  You divorce her.  Yeah.  You don't marry her till the mother wins.  Take a rice fishing.  An old boot into the hole.  Oopsie daisy.  Oopsie daisy.  There you go.  Slipparoo.  Oops.  I got to give credit to Danny.  Other websites are going with this whole P. Diddy blog thing.  But Danny, I'm telling you on top of it once again. 
[01:14:00]  P. Diddy puts out a blog at this point I think once a week.  And they're just ridiculous.  And other websites are picking up on how ridiculous P. Diddy is and his video blogs.  The last one we did was what?  He's all bummed he has to fly commercial because of the gas prices?  Yeah.  He grounded his jet.  Yeah.  Because gas prices is too high.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well now he's talking about the fact that there are no black people in Alaska and he doesn't...  And what does that have to do with anything?  Oh, he's trying to show what he knows about this. 
[01:14:30]  Good things about Alaska.  Jesus.  My goodness.  Yeah.  He's trying to show that he's got some intelligence as far as this political thing goes.  So he's saying there's no black people in Alaska.  And is he upset by this?  Does he like it?  We're going to find out here.  By the way...  Hold up there.  They are photoshopping this Sarah Palin on hot bodies.  Oh, they are?  Left and right. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  She's kind of what they call a milf, I guess.  Eh.  Eh.  I mean, eh.  Can I tell you how much of a hack I really am?  And I know it.  I'm not stupid.  I mean, people whisper this out there in the radio land.  But I know I'm a hack.  Oh, they don't say that to your face.  For the last three years, three days, I couldn't wait to go on the radio to make my observation  that she looks just like Tina Fey.  Tina Fey.  I'm like, I'm going to hit it out of the park with this one. 
[01:15:30]  I'm going to tell everybody that she looks just like Tina Fey.  Yeah.  I think a hundred people said that before I got to.  Already, yeah.  Already.  I'm like, no one's going to see it my way.  It does.  All right, anyway, here's P. Diddy with the blog on McCain's Choice here.  Yeah.  Diddy Obama blog.  Diddy Obama blog.  Diddy Obama blog number 16.  Hey, yo.  Attention, John McCain.  Attention, John McCain.  My name is Diddy, okay? 
[01:16:00]  You may know me by my government name, Sean Cone.  You have a telephone call at the front desk.  Mr. Diddy.  Mr. Diddy.  I love how Pee-wee does that.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Oh, boy.  He did.  He's going to tell us how it is.  Sean Combs, but, you know, my friends and my family, they call me Diddy, a.k.a.  Ciroc Obama.  We'll get to that on a whole nother blog. 
[01:16:30]  But right now, I had to check in with you to tell you that you are bugging me.  I know what I call him.  Yeah.  I don't even understand what planet you're on right now.  Earth.  This is the job to be the leader of the free world.  Okay?  No disrespect.  I love you.  I want you to live to be 110.  But things happen.  Like, what if, God forbid, you got a running mate, you become president, Alaska? 
[01:17:00]  Alaska.  Alaska.  Alaska.  Come on, man.  I don't even know if there's any black people in Alaska.  Oh, he said he doesn't know.  Come on.  This isn't.  I would say yes.  Sarah, yo, if you really think that we're going to let you win this election with these, these, like, crazy decisions that you're making, you're bugging.  Okay? 
[01:17:30]  I'm calling all youth, all colors, all youth voters.  November 4th.  We have to protect our future because John McCain is bugging the f*** out.  Okay?  I don't understand why P. Diddy hasn't been on Meet the Press yet.  Yeah.  He's terrific.  He's fantastic.  Through process of elimination, I honestly am going to tell you, he's the stupidest man in the face of the years.  Holy Jesus.  What, what is he thinking? 
[01:18:00]  First of all, the way he's talking about her.  Yeah.  Is exactly how a lot of people feel about Obama.  Yeah.  So, you know.  So shut up.  You're being kind of a hypocrite.  Of course.  And remember, the youth has to get out on November 4th.  The youth.  And vote.  He is.  Because they're bugging.  A dummy.  Or who's bugging?  What?  McCain's just bugging.  So he's bugging.  The youth got to get out.  McCain's got to get in and he's got to respond to this.  And get on the podium and just go, I'm not bugging. 
[01:18:30]  And repeat that a few times.  Yeah, with the thumb point.  See, P. Diddy likes to repeat because he runs out of, like, intelligent thought.  So the way around that is just to repeat.  Alaska, Alaska, Alaska, Alaska.  Alaska.  What?  It continues.  She's the heartbeat of ways.  It's like, oh, s***.  And then she, the president.  Is she going to be on the phone with a man from South Korea or, like, what's she?  I mean, what in the? 
[01:19:00]  Does he think these through before he says them?  No.  He's one of those self-important douches that thinks that he's got an intelligent thought  in his brain that needs to get there.  Wow.  Dude, he's a bore.  He stinks.  He makes really smart business decisions.  He's a bright dude.  Does he?  How?  Maybe it's somebody who works for him.  This is the most uninteresting, other than the fact that it's a guy who we all turn out  to be stupid. 
[01:19:30]  I've never heard anybody who just sounded dumber in a blog.  Is this a tape of Palin's new baby?  Whoa!  By the way, that's number three.  Yeah, of course.  We're slacking.  We should be up to 10 to 20 by now.  Of course we should.  Just wait until the mohair cuts.  The White House barber's going to have to learn a new cut.  Start renting some Three Stooges and some old Reds games. 
[01:20:00]  It just never stops. 
[01:20:30]  All right, here.  More P.  Diddy.  Well, she, I mean, what in the hell?  Alaska, you should have got Michelle Obama to be a running mate.  Now, that would have been something strategic and fly.  This one right here is not respectful to our lives, diverse lives.  Anybody?  Yo, you would let her keep your kids?  What? 
[01:21:00]  You would let her keep your kids, Raja?  Do you feel like, for real?  Nah, you're bugging the f*** out.  You my man.  God bless you.  You're a great war hero.  But you are bugging the f*** out.  What's wrong with watching the kids?  I think she'd probably make a good babysitter.  All right, I mean, you know.  I don't know.  She has her own kids.  She'd be sitting the kid.  Oh, my God. 
[01:21:30]  Old Reds.  Like, you want to rent that?  Yeah, I know.  I need some old Reds games.  What?  Long story.  I'm a barber.  I'm a bunch of three stooges.  Like, you need many to go over.  Yes.  And then just give me scissors and a bowl.  One more ditty clip.  Yeah.  Before the break.  Sarah, pay like that. 
[01:22:00]  That is completely irresponsible.  Yo, Sarah, I want you to be down with, you know, the whole cabinet.  Yo, Sarah, you ain't ready to be no vice president, man.  Now, you need to...  Well, P. Diddy, you're not ready to be a blogger.  Yeah, P. Diddy is just dumb.  Wow.  President, man.  Now, you need to stop playing, Sarah.  For real.  Y'all are bugging.  It's your boy, Diddy.  I'm about to get focused.  I got to make sure that all young people, all the forgotten ones that y'all don't even speak to, 
[01:22:30]  that they come out and get busy on your asses on November 4th and vote in record numbers.  Because you are bugging the f*** out, John McCain.  Right?  Yeah.  Diddy Block, number 16, Sirocco Obama.  It's not going to be the last time you hear my name.  I'm going to bring millions out to the polls November 4th to make sure that...  Are you...  Alaska?  What the f***?  What is the reality in Alaska? 
[01:23:00]  Like, what is...  There's not even no crackheads in Alaska.  There's not even...  No black people.  There's not even no, like...  Crime?  Or, like...  Well...  Foreign policies.  Y'all may be versed on foreign policies.  Y'all need to get versed on black policies.  And youth policies.  This is lead painting.  We the future.  John, you're bugging the f*** out, man.  Wow. 
[01:23:30]  Well, there's the P. Diddy video block.  P. Diddy is a complete idiot.  How is he saying that?  And that's like a racist friggin' rant, too.  So what?  There's no black people in Alaska as far as Diddy knows.  And he's bummed there's no crime in Alaska?  First of all, there is.  There are black people in Alaska.  They're Eskimo foes. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  We got the black people coming out of the woodwork today.  I'm black.  Diddy does not speak for us.  Let's go to John in New York City.  John.  Hello.  I sure hope he doesn't speak for you.  Oh, God.  What a dummy. 
[01:24:30]  Know what he should be doing?  Instead of, like, doing video blogs, he should be in Biggie Smalls' mom's attic and see if  he can find some more tapes to exploit.  Oh, you know, I'm just saying, I mean, it's wrong to vote for Obama because he's black.  He should vote for the guy who's getting it done.  But, like, still, I mean, I hate to say it, but this nigga's lost his mind.  I mean, for real.  I mean, how are you going to say there's no crackheads?  Like, all crack have to be associated with black people?  I mean, he's insulting black people right there.  He's ashamed.  Yeah, he was insulting black people by saying, you know, are there any black people there? 
[01:25:00]  Is there any crime?  Like, right.  Right.  He's been his back 50 years.  I mean, jeez, Diddy.  Yeah.  Ah, man.  I'm really ashamed of him right now.  I mean, you know, I put my head down.  I listen to him.  Were you ever proud of him, though?  Seriously.  What has Diddy done?  Diddy did come up from nothing, and he made it to work.  Oh, dude.  But it's because of, yeah.  Because his boy got shot.  That's why he's famous.  That wasn't because his boy got shot.  Hell yeah, that's why.  That was it.  He was a flunky, and then his boy got shot, and then he made a song using Sting's music, 
[01:25:30]  and that was about it.  And then he went from using police music to everyone's music.  I'm going to tell you, between me and you, he probably got Biggie shot.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Who knows?  But I don't think anyone has ever been proud of the guy.  He decided out of nowhere to run the New York City Marathon just for more attention.  Yeah.  He just does his attention-seeking thing.  Did you just laugh?  Well, anyway, I love you guys, man.  Good show. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Silly Diddy.  Felons can't vote.  This is why terrorists hate us.  Scott in St. Louis, what's up?  Anchorage, Alaska.  Summertime.  1.2 million people.  Me and my buddies were up there in June.  We counted 16 black people.  We might have counted the same one a couple times.  16.  16.  16.  There you go.  It's over there.  Oh, my God.  They're going where the black Eskimos live. 
[01:26:30]  They're called f*** blues.  All right.  We are doing a tightrope act today.  Oh, damn.  We are doing a Philippe Petit today, my friends.  That's a good one on Pal Talk.  Thank you.  We can fall off the wire at any moment.  Oh, yeah.  This is a very carefully choreographed.  Is it?  We're now stupider for hearing that.  We're now all dumber, yes.  Do we really want an Eskimo in the White House? 
[01:27:00]  She's married to someone that is part Eskimo, right?  Really?  Yeah, he's part Eskimo, Sarah Palin's husband.  He got a DUI a while back?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a world champion snowmobiler.  Snowmobiler.  At least an Alaskan champion, and he did get a DUI 20 years ago.  Oh, that's nothing.  Yeah, Bush.  Didn't George Bush got one, too?  Yeah.  Who cares?  People have it.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Political advice from Diddy's like getting flying lessons from Corey Lytle. 
[01:27:30]  That's Tom and Franklin Square.  No.  Jesus.  They're commenting on who they are speculating would have to fly on Air Force Dumb.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, come on.  When we get back, we got the Love and Licks commercial.  Do not.  Oh, yeah.  Don't go anywhere.  Don't go anywhere.  What year is this from?  That's, like, new. 
[01:28:00]  Is that new?  You're getting away with this?  Yeah, like, that toy is, like, still for...  Like, you can get that.  Whoa.  No way.  All right.  Listen to that.  We got the man trying to amputate his arm at the local Denny's.  Really?  There was something else that was really good we wanted to get to.  We'll remember during the break, I'm sure.  Oh, maybe a replay of the Geraldo audio.  Oh, right.  For the people that are just tuning in today.  We should play it every hour like Fox did.  No kidding.  No kidding.  It made a lot of people laugh pretty hard earlier.  All right.  Lots to do still.  Opie and Anthony, stay there. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Let's acknowledge we lost the great Killer Kowalski over the weekend.  Oh, yeah?  Wrestling great Killer Kowalski.  He trained a lot of the guys.  I think he trained Triple H.  Sam's on his way back from Minnesota.  He's the wrestling guy.  So, but he was 81 years old.  What else?  In real sports, how about them Yankees? 
[01:29:00]  Huh, fellas?  Love the Yankees.  Seven games behind Boston for the wild card.  For the wild card, right.  Just a disaster.  Did it again, A-Rod.  Oh, yeah.  It's so great.  Oh, yeah.  It sucks.  I'm so happy to see the Yankee fans booing A-Rod at this point pretty much every time  he gets a bat.  And they're 12 games out of first.  You got the Mets.  You know, my team.  Two games up in first place behind the head of the Phillies there. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  And then in other sports news, you got this Bengals wide receiver.  He's a showboater, yes.  A lot of people know who Chad Johnson is.  Well, he legally changed his name to Chad Ochocinco.  Why?  Just so we would talk about it today.  Ochocinco.  Well, that's 85.  And that's his number.  So, he decided to change his name to Chad Ochocinco.  No one should call him that.  Mr. Ochocinco, your table's ready. 
[01:30:00]  Do show chills, though.  Yep.  And we're on in good old Cleveland.  Congrats to Cliff Lee.  Who is Cliff Lee, you might ask?  I am asking.  They know in Cleveland, my friend.  The first 20-game winner since 1974 for the Indians.  Oh.  Well, how about that?  That 20-game thing doesn't happen as often these days because too many pitchers in the  rotation.  So, yeah.  Hey, we got this fine commercial for everybody. 
[01:30:30]  Love and Licks.  Now, this is a toy, apparently.  It's a little dog.  Mm-hmm.  And it's very realistic.  Yeah.  It does certain things that dogs do.  Yeah.  Cool.  Which, no, it sounds like that's maybe a bad.  It's not like you got to take it out and walk it.  It doesn't have those actual lifelike features, but it does something.  And the way they present it in this commercial is a little odd. 
[01:31:00]  Peanut butter not included.  Oven mitts not included.  Oven mitts.  The old oven mitts.  Keep those scratches off you any way you can.  Like, that's the least of your worries.  A few scratches.  Here is, uh, what is it called?  Love and Licks.  Sure.  Amazing pets.  How wet will you get from a Love and Licks kiss? 
[01:31:30]  So wet, you should wear a bathing suit.  How wet will you get from a Love and Licks kiss?  So wet, you need a towel.  Love and Licks.  Give that amazing wet kiss.  Press this paw and he barks my eyes just a little.  Rub his head or belly and he barks my eyes more.  He's happy.  And when his puppy legs shakes, he's so happy that you'll get so wet.  You'll need a raincoat.  Love and Licks.  Give that amazing wet kiss.  New amazing Love and Licks puppies give real wet kisses.  Each sold separately.  The battery's not included.  That's a little weird. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  They know that, though.  They go for that thing.  Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.  Rub his tummy and lipstick pops out.  Do you honestly think that went through the chain of command and not one person went, uh,  Hello?  Hey, that sounds a little inappropriate.  So wet, you have to wear a bathing suit.  That's a little weird.  Do you really need kids saying that?  If you want to sell some toys?  Yeah.  My favorite still is this, of course. 
[01:32:30]  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Post your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth I will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Walk in a room.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Bucket's a drink.  Yeah.  Well, he describes when, uh, cause, uh, he goes, I missed the bucket.  The balls pop out of my mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Do they?  Uh, let's say hi to Clark in Texas.  Clark.  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Hey.  You know, you were really close to this, uh, Gustav thing, right?  Uh, I'm heading north. 
[01:33:00]  Hell with them.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Yeah.  They said if it made a left-hand turn, then Houston might have a problem, but.  I'm down by the Dallas area anyway, so.  But, uh, that's Ocho Cinco thing.  That's 8-5, not 85.  So the dope even got that wrong.  Yeah, that's a good point.  8-5.  That took six years of Spanish.  What's 85 in Spanish?  I have no clue.  I don't either.  What?  It's like Ocho Cinco.  Ocho Cinco.  Sure.  But on the back of the jersey, it's 8 and a 5, and it kind of makes sense. 
[01:33:30]  Mm-hmm.  No, it doesn't.  No.  His name makes sense.  Hey, uh, we don't have Sam here, but someone, well, Fast Friday, he's good for a few every  week.  He says that we should do a little bleep game with the Love and Licks commercial.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that could work.  Yeah, here.  But, uh, the bleep guy is, uh.  The bleep guy is, uh, flying.  Maybe someone else could try the bleep game with the Love and Licks thing, see if it  works.  Hey, you want to play the Geraldo stuff again?  Please.  It's what I live for.  You know, the old days, we would play stuff two, three times. 
[01:34:00]  Now?  Now we don't.  But today, we have to replay the Geraldo thing.  It's just too good.  He's too big an ass to not acknowledge twice in this program what a complete buffoon Geraldo  is, trotting down there to New Orleans for a Gustav, which, uh, didn't, uh, hit New Orleans.  They knew it wasn't going to hit.  They knew it was going to, uh, go just, uh, west of New Orleans and, um, not really make 
[01:34:30]  this big impact.  It, uh, you know, they, they got some flooding and stuff, but nothing like Katrina.  And Geraldo wings himself down there looking to make a story, right?  The guy can't just report on what's going on.  He tries to make a story wherever he goes.  Well, he used to be good at that back in the day, but.  And this one is, uh.  Well, we have to play something else.  Classic.  This just did.  Oh.  That, uh, Love and Licks commercial, uh, reminded us of the, uh, Ortega taco commercial that 
[01:35:00]  Shawn Johnson, uh, did.  Yeah.  Olympic, Olympic, uh, great.  I say Olympic great because I don't know what medal she won.  She won gold and silver.  She did, right?  Yeah, she picked, she was the little kind of squatty one.  All right.  Well, she's, uh, already doing commercials and this one's a little questionable.  What do champion gymnast Paul Hom, Morgan Hom, and Shawn Johnson have in common?  Great taste and Ortega. 
[01:35:30]  My tacos, the best.  I love Ortega's taco style.  My taco's the best.  Is it?  Yep.  Yep.  Mmm.  Nice.  My taco's the best.  My taco's the best.  Mmm.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's a pretty tall order.  You know, uh, when I think tacos, when I think of a good taco, Anthony, I think, uh,  a taco without the, uh, the sour cream.  Not a big fan of the sour cream when it comes to the taco. 
[01:36:00]  It's true.  Ugh.  What makes a good taco in your book?  Ah.  Shaved.  can i say that they should change anarchists arrested at a republican national convention  to overprivileged white kids trying to show mommy and daddy how independent they are 
[01:36:30]  these little brats are tipping over god they're like pushing these big cement garbage  uh what are they called dumpsters yeah into the street and they're all wearing their black ninja  hoods like there's some kind of uh counterculture yeah force against establishment man this is  anarchy just a bunch of really spoiled suburban white kids uh what a bunch of little brats their  message board posters yeah because they're they're they don't want their face to to be known yeah if

[01:42:30]  i'm telling the cops here quick guys look there's a person in the water there i would love if they  just beat heraldo senseless with batons and tasered him yes sergeant g from iraq makes a good point who  says there's a person is there's someone there's somebody there's a guy there's a person because  they're trying to really humanize it yeah homo sapien h2o straight ahead 
[01:43:00]  what a boob he is there's a human being with feelings in the water might have a wife and children  evolved ape  oh do i have one  we almost clunked heads on that one  rush to the unemployment line  i'm going to acknowledge that it is indeed tuesday not monday  yes okay good that'd be a good 
[01:43:30]  quick guys look there's a person in the water there  right there a person in the lifejack you see him  there's a person in the he's swimming  oh he's got a lifeline he's got a lifeline he's got a lifeline  oh my god  all right they they get him safely on board is he safely on board yeah because he was never in 
[01:44:00]  danger yes we're all though don't worry and the guy in the water is pointing up going oh my god hey  there's a douche with a microphone right there right there he's floundering  put him in the water he's  for all they're just sorry  push him in the water he's floundering  all right get him safely on board  is he safely on board looks like he's safely on board it was unbelievable uh 
[01:44:30]  he he it was a man in the water with a life jacket on i don't know what they  whether he had in uh voluntarily jumped into to do some emergency maneuver or whether or not he  was swept off the deck of that tugboat they got a lifeline to him he is back on board the kent  uh the army corps of engineers tugboat now uh but uh it is uh it is ferocious and uh uh  quite quite extraordinary oh my god that was unbelievable  so if there's an army corps of engineers boat in the area why can't you make the assumption that 
[01:45:00]  this might have something to do with yeah with that and not some guy that got swept uh into the water  yeah like it's leon klinghoffer it's a person for the people that don't know that obviously was a  guy that meant to be in the water yeah i think it's pretty and it was obvious because he had a  life jacket on and was tethered to the ship the army yeah the army corps of engineers boat tugboat 
[01:45:30]  which was there to help things along right to make sure things didn't happen uh like people  being swept in the water and debris yeah he had a lifeline with a vest people reeling him in after  he did his duty and yet panic from stupid oh my god there's a man in the air he's on the top of the  telephone pole and he's tethered safely to repairing things oh the man is a fool yeah you know what joe

[01:53:30]  mm-hmm but sarge the fat guy was floating who looks at that and chuckles  a beans joke yeah a lot of beans he's gassy  who who looks at that and laughs who looks at that and does anything but throw their newspaper  on the floor it's like it doesn't evoke anything but irritation that the space if they just put 
[01:54:00]  photographs of duty  put your own funny caption in here sure what a great thing that would be that would be so much  better duty photos  in the paper in the paper might as well like wedding announcements  that that stuff is crap anyway oh this is so nice all right we got to take a break maybe jimmy we'll uh 
[01:54:30]  sherman's lagoon when we come back oh wow  and once again uh sarah palin who could be uh the vice president of the united states of america as we go to  a break as for that vp talk all the time i tell you i still can't answer that question  until until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day 
[01:55:00]  moving right along with the opian anthony show  got a man trying to amputate his own arm that's what happened there story just for the hell of  it or was he stuck because usually you got to be stuck in a combine or something or in a rock  formation yeah something like that maybe cut your arm off and you read about those stories you read  about the guy that was stuck oh yeah his own arm off with a tiny little pocket knife little pocket  knife how the hell do you get that done that that's not something i don't think you do right 
[01:55:30]  away that's like hmm how do i get out of this i think he realized his hand was pretty smashed anyway  and uh just started hacking and then he had to cut through the bone he had to like hack at it with  the blade like he was using an axe i think he tried to i think he broke his own arm just to make  the cutting a little easier jesus yeah it's all man well or dope not dope they said if he didn't do 
[01:56:00]  that he would have died yeah no one was going to find him in time anyway we got a man uh that's uh  cutting his own arm off and it's a lot different than what we just described okay this guy's just a  dope story about a man who police say tried to cut his arm off with a butter knife now here's the report  steve a butter knife i look i got this is a little sharper than a butter knife sauce sauce so i'm 
[01:56:30]  getting nothing done no filed on the motive behind this madness for a kitchen knife that was about eight  inches long sergeant brian finland was one of the first policemen to answer the call 33 year old michael  lassiter in a denny's restaurant trying to amputate his own arm when i walked in was actually digging  it into his bicep this surveillance video captures lassiter heading into the denny's his arm outstretched  he told police he needed to cut it off better than because of an accident shooting up cocaine at the 
[01:57:00]  hotel next door i could see him cringing on his face and he was digging it into his bicep as we walked  did police say lassiter was shooting up in this room when he got scared he shot an air bubble into  his bloodstream oh see he thought he shot an air bubble into himself so he's going to cut his arm  off so the bubble didn't go to his heart and kill him why not get a sharper knife  see a butter knife by the time you did that the air bubble would probably get to your heart yeah as a 
[01:57:30]  matter of fact i think it would have gotten to it before he left the hotel room it kind of you know  the return trip back ain't that doesn't take that long oh oh yes danny apparently he doesn't know how  the circulatory system works yes he thinks it's very slow because in the surveillance video that  they talk about in the piece he's walking and as he's walking he's kind of grabbing his arm and kind  of putting it up to his chest and all you're doing is circulating the blood yeah body when you're doing 
[01:58:00]  that he didn't have a tourniquet around it that's what you would need if you really wanted to stop that  air bubble you would need to cut the circulation off from your arm not just flail it as you walk  to denny's yeah but wait the air bubble is that bad oh yeah yeah give you an embolism or something  embolism it's the death basically is that why they snap their finger a needle it knocks out the  air bubbles well you shoot a little out of the thing to make sure there's no air in there yeah i think  they do that so much anymore because i shot air me once on purpose like a whole bunch of air did you 
[01:58:30]  no no he got to the front of the hotel that's when he saw the denny's straight across the parking  lot video shows as he's heading inside he actually walks right past an ambulance the paramedic team  was inside the denny's eating dinner sergeant finland arrived within one minute he was actively stabbing  his right arm uh he seemed rather unfazed that we were even there eventually police used the taser  to get lasseter under control his arm bloodied but still intact if it wasn't for our quick response 
[01:59:00]  that he may have been a little bit more successful he'd still be there trying to say on that one  lasseter is recovering from his injuries and right now he is in the san joaquin county jail he is facing  a couple of different charges related to drugs because police say he never tried to hurt anyone else with  that knife  what was he going to spread marmalade on them it's a butter knife denny's all right no you're not getting 
[01:59:30]  any help in there he is lucky the ambulance was there the baby lance yeah say it right uh baby lance  i need a baby lance  100 year old woman found shot dead in long island home yes police are hunting for the gunman who killed a  100 year old woman in her home in the hamptons jesse burke celebrated her 100th birthday on august  7th you're not even gonna lead her that's like a clean shot she went to she went to blow out the

[02:01:30]  uh uh no break in no forcible entry and nothing stolen inside job  yeah it sounds like maybe uh they're looking into the daughter  the motive 76 or something the motive uh was will you die already yeah enough  i'm 76 years old and you're still alive just just clinging to the possessions miss selfish here

[02:06:00]  How can anyone think you're not enjoying goofy and retarded people when you hear it?  Like, why else would he sing that?  Yeah.  Who buys that thinking, this kid's going to sing?  It was live, he's creeping around.  I interviewed the Demasi brothers, I believe, Joe and John.  Who are they?  They were the real musicians, and they had to do this with Corky.  With Corky, yeah.  And they weren't willing to admit it, but you could tell they were like,  we've been working our whole lives to get something out there in the public,  and this is what we get to get out there. 
[02:06:30]  What's he doing?  He's still acting?  He just celebrated a birthday.  Acting.  Acting.  What kind of acting did he do?  He played a retarded guy.  I stand corrected.  He's still showing up?  That's all he's got to do.  It's not like he's doing Shakespeare.  You can look, but you better not touch.  Yeah.  He'll bite you.  Rapunzel, let your hair down.  I can't.  I interviewed Corky back in the day. 
[02:07:00]  Really?  Oh, yeah, I did.  I remember that.  Oh, yeah, I did.  Peaked in the window of the studio.  I was at BAB on Long Island, and I swear to God, you know, we all used to do that joke,  hey, look, it's Corky.  When you see something.  Well, yeah.  Trying to keep it slightly safe today, even though we've already fallen over the edge.  And this thing was looking into the window as I was broadcasting my nighttime attitude, 
[02:07:30]  and I said, hey, everybody, it's Corky.  Yeah.  But in this case, it was Corky.  It really was Corky.  Like, because you just think, hey, look, it's Corky.  And then, no, it really was.  It really was this time.  Corky.  I'd like to hear that interview.  I might have that.  But tomorrow, if Stump Brain reminds me.  Oh, I will.  My Jerry Lewis telethon stuff that I did back in the day.  That I want to hear. 
[02:08:00]  I'm actually looking forward to that very much.  Yeah, audio me on a ladder, and I can't come down until they raise a bunch of money during  that segment with all the phone screeners cheering and stuff.  They were cheering, go Opie, like.  Yeah, go Opie.  And I did so well with this local telethon coverage that I didn't even tell you guys this,  but I parlayed that into a big gig where I was hanging at the Rochester airport. 
[02:08:30]  Doing live cut-ins about a new airline.  Oh.  A new airline.  And what was that?  I don't remember, but it was the worst thing ever.  You had that, too?  Yeah, I'll bring that in.  I think it's on the same tape.  So, wait.  When were you singing?  Like, when were you singing Welcome to the Future?  I don't know if I have that, to be honest with you, but then I was, like, in the vestibule 
[02:09:00]  of the TV station, and people would come by, and I would do reports there as people would  come by with their donations, and I would sing, like, Guns N' Roses and stuff.  I don't know if they have that.  What did your girl think when she saw it?  Like, what was her remark?  It wasn't good, Jimmy.  I know her sense of humor is pretty caustic.  She threw a ring at him, and hence my broken toe.  See, because it's big.  Oh, because it's big.  It certainly is.  Linger, longer from earlier today.  A lot of hobbled Africans for that one, I bet.  Whoa. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Blood Diamond?  Yeah.  Well, I could have her write down what she thought, and then I'll read it tomorrow.  Okay.  I'll read it tomorrow on the air.  Top song of the day?  Oh, okay.  We'll leave you with this.  This is rolling.  We like to do this from time to time.  We get the boys to sing the top song of the day.  Oh, yeah.  We'll squeeze this in before we go today.  I'll have that audio tomorrow.  It's definitely a must-listen for tomorrow's show.  Rolling, everyone.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:10:00]  Opie and Anthony's top song of the day.  Katy Perry.  I Kissed a Girl.  I kissed a girl, and I liked it.  The taste of her, Sherry Chestnut.  I kissed a girl.  Just to try it.  I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.  If this is all wrong.  If this is all right.  Don't mean I'm in love tonight.  I kissed a girl, and I liked it. 
[02:10:30]  I liked it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Those are actually thoughts rolling his hat.  All right.  Yeah.  First day back.  It was fun.  Absolutely.  Went fast over here.  It was a good two for Tuesday.  Mm-hmm.  And I guess we'll, um, see, uh, you. 
[02:11:00]  Uh, well, I'll not see you.  It's the radio.  I'll talk to you again tomorrow.  Hmm.  I wonder what'll happen.  What news?  Tomorrow?  Delve into tomorrow.  And won't, um, won't our own, uh, primetime Sam Roberts be back with some tape?  What's the haps?  Yeah, he talked to the, uh, protest, the protesters up there in Minnesota. 
[02:11:30]  We'll do a little of that.  Some of my telethon audio, which is going to be cringy at best.  We have to.  And other things.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:12:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Sirius XM Radio.  Oh.  Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Rolls right off the tongue.  Sure does.  28 days and counting.  Hi.  Just because people are asking, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just because people are asking.  That's right.  It's being worked on.  Mm-hmm.  I'm just adjusting my volume. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  All right.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Do, do, dee, da.  Just adjust.  I didn't forget that we still have uncomfortable cringe interviews to play.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't forget.  I did.  You did?  Yeah.  We have the Dax Shepard.  Or did we play that one? 
[02:13:00]  I don't remember.  I don't either.  Yeah, I'm getting word that we played it.  Okay.  Then we got Ed Asner still.  Mm-hmm.  We did the Linda Lovelace.  That was terrific.  We have Mr. DVD and Steve the Whistler.  Yeah.  These are interviews that we have done over the years with celebrities and non-celebrities alike.  But one thing they all have in common, we were assholes.  Can I play the Ed Asner? 
[02:13:30]  Ed Asner.  Please.  This is my favorite.  Ed Asner.  The great Ed Asner.  Yes.  Lou.  Lou.  Lou Grant.  I think Opie's mocking you, Lou.  Yeah, it was, uh, you were too busy playing cards.  Yeah, I was, uh, we were playing a poker tournament.  I mean, it was a broadcast and I was playing and, uh, Ed Asner came up.  I missed my chance to have an interview there, interview Ed Asner.  Well, you'll get him next time.  Well, yeah, there'll be him next time, all right.  I think that was shot to shit. 
[02:14:00]  And, uh, it was me and Rogan and I think, uh, Jimmy, were you even there?  And Voss was there, sure.  And you were there, too?  And Voss.  Voss was cringing.  Yeah.  Who do you think was going, uh, you're trying to get rid of me?  Yes.  What are you doing, Ben?  Ben, what are you doing?  Sign language.  What's his sign language?  Ed, that's Ben.  He's our producer.  And he decides when a guest is getting a little too boring, and that was the sign that he 
[02:14:30]  usually gives.  More disrespect to Ed.  Yeah, you just pretty much told him, look, uh, he gives the sign when people are boring,  and he just gave the sign.  Yeah.  What'd you add to this there, E-Rock?  It looks the same.  Nope, those two right there.  More Linda Lovelace?  No, Linda Blair.  What'd you add to it, E-Rock?  Oh, Linda Blair, whatever.  E-Rock, did you add anything to it?  Oh, the Cindy Williams, whatever.  Okay.  Who said what the fuck, Rogan? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, it sounds like Rogan.  Yeah, but Rogan was...  That's how Rogan rolls.  He fucking...  He's a good actor.  He'll, yeah, say, oh my god, that's terrible, and then jump right in.  Yeah.  Boring, and that was the sign that...  What the fuck?  He usually gives, and more disrespect to Ed.  We're having a good interview, and Ed asked me.  I can tell you, Anthony, that that's the last time...  He doesn't even know you're not there.  Anthony, he's calling you by my name, so I get...  Anything you say now fucks me over.  No, I think at that point, he didn't want to acknowledge that I was breathing, and I think 
[02:15:30]  he was, like, saying that to Joe Rogan, thinking it was you.  Oh, thinking...  Oh, okay.  Disrespecting.  We're having a good interview, and Ed asked me.  I can tell you, Anthony, that that's the last time I'll ever be on your show.  No, that was...  Yeah, Ben.  I've suffered your insults enough.  I certainly wouldn't come back again.  I'll be glad to talk to you about the Columbia documentary some other time when he's not around.  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a big fan.  I love you. 
[02:16:00]  Absolutely.  Jimmy.  Jimmy has to be the...  They're like an enabler.  You fuck.  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a big fan.  You're like the fucking...  Oh, Worm Norton.  You're like the kid in between, like, divorced parents.  Separated parents.  I don't remember.  Code of parents.  No, he's not around.  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a big fan.  I love you.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Be sure that he's not in there.  I know he does this all the time.  I'm a big fan.  I'm very happy to have you on the show.  He is a destroyer.  He's a destroyer. 
[02:16:30]  He's like Gordon Gekko.  He builds nothing.  He liquidates.  He's filthy.  He's greasy.  Yes, he is.  I don't want to smell his shorts.  He's a spendthole.  In quotes, I don't want to smell his shorts.  Ed Asner.  Bravo.  The great Ed Asner.  The great Ed Asner.  Thank you, sir.  Very nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  You're a destroyer.  He called you a destroyer.  Wait till Anthony hears this on the replay.  That was phenomenal.  Hey, Jimmy, get back here, man. 
[02:17:00]  I started sweating.  Ed, no, come on.  Give me a handshake, please.  Fuck you.  No, fuck you.  Dude, Ed Asner just said, fuck you.  Oh, that's phenomenal.  He was not happy.  Oh, that's good.  Give me a handshake.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Ed Asner.  The great Ed Asner.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Sorry, I missed that one.  I'm sure I would have been in a corner in a fetal position like Jimmy probably was.  Oh, it was awful.  Like you were for Steve the Whistler? 
[02:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let's do a little Steve the Whistler.  I had to hide.  What was Steve the Whistler?  He whistles.  He whistled.  And he makes it sound.  He does competitions all over the world, I guess.  He put on an album of him whistling popular songs.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  He wanted to show off his talent.  But the problem was he had a CD that he had to play.  And then he whistled along to the CD.  You can't whistle a cappella.  That's just silly.  So we fucked with the CD and made believe it wasn't working over and over and over again.  And that's Steve the Whistler. 
[02:18:00]  This is, I swear to God.  Oh, this is so bad.  Now I remember the song and everything.  I can listen to Steve the Whistler audio every day.  He's just fucking horrendous.  He was off and running.  Not knowing it was going to be a false start 20 times.  Oh, God. 
[02:18:30]  I love, uh, whatever.  Stupid tune.  I couldn't help myself and I needed to whistle along with the great whistler.  Because he really takes this very seriously, this whistling song.  It does.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened to the CD?  Put it in the, um.  Steve, I'm sorry.  You put it in the wrong one, dude.  No, no.  Something happened to CD4.  All right.  Steve the Whistler. 
[02:19:00]  It wasn't working last time.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Here we go again.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler.  Oh, what the hell is going on with the CD4?  Dude, you got it.  That's the third time you've had a problem with that one.  Clean it.  This is the same one that was skipping earlier.  Put it in the other one.  Why didn't Steve the Whistler?  All right.  We're all acting.  No.  Why?  I don't understand, Steve the Whistler.  Our acting is the worst. 
[02:19:30]  That's the third time you've had a problem with that one.  Clean it.  This is the same one that was skipping earlier.  Put it in the other one.  Steve the Whistler.  I'll look.  I'll look.  I think.  Steve, I'm embarrassed.  What the hell is wrong with this?  Turn it off and turn it on. 
[02:20:00]  Ann, can you turn it off from the back there?  I'm doing it.  I'm holding the button down.  I'm holding the button.  Track four, right?  Steve, I'm sorry.  Track nine.  It'll work now, though, guaranteed, because I saw the light on there.  When you were hiding behind the fucking machinery?  I had to run and hide behind the machinery in the studio because I was so...  I was laughing my ass off, and I couldn't look him in the face.  This is a highlight because this went on for 40 minutes or something.  That's why, at this point, Ann couldn't take it anymore.  Oh, no, I was losing my mind. 
[02:20:30]  Track four, right?  Steve, I'm sorry.  Track nine.  Track nine, right?  It'll work now, though, guaranteed, because I saw the light on here, and I pressed the breaker.  Yeah, nine.  Nine.  I'm sorry, Steve.  Okay.  Let's try it again here.  All right.  One more time.  That's not going.  It's stuck.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:21:00]  Nice tone, though, right?  Yeah, that was.  I apologize.  All right.  Oh, God.  Did you get it to stick like that?  I don't remember.  Steve the Whistler.  I love Steve the Whistler.  Remember his album cover?  Oh, where he's like, on the cover, on the hood of a car.  On the hood of a car with, like, he was kind of sitting on it like he was trying to look  cool.  He was sexy.  The license plate said whistle.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God. 
[02:21:30]  Whistle.  Yeah.  What a douche.  It was going to be his big radio appearance, and he's going to whistle.  We showed him, right, guys?  He certainly did.  I'll say this, though.  He could whistle a tune.  Yeah, he sure can, Jimmy.  What a guy.  With all of a sudden done, that fucker could whistle up a storm.  Yeah.  All right.  We can play. 
[02:22:00]  That and 50 cents will get you a cup of coffee.  Get on the subway.  I eat to the rock found our uncomfortable interview with Linda Blair.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  From The Exorcist.  Wasn't that here?  No.  Big Kev got us this interview.  He went to that thing, that geek thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he wound up getting Linda Blair for us on the phone.  Yep.  And we were men of few words.  Mm-hmm.  And she was not reacting.  No. 
[02:22:30]  And right now on the phone, it's Linda Blair.  Linda Blair.  The power of Christ compels you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Woo-hoo!  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  Are you done yet?  The power of Christ compels you! 
[02:23:00]  The power of Christ compels you! 
[02:23:30]  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  We were really committed.  Linda Blair, everyone!  That's funny, Linda Blair.  Yeah, here she is. 
[02:24:00]  Linda Blair!  Saying hello, hello, alright, I'm bored.  Oh, my ribs!  Yeah, I'm being reminded that Big Kev got her on the phone for us,  and while he had her on the phone for us, he was interviewing Adam West.  And because this whole thing went down, he got thrown out of his big convention.  He loves going on those things.  Yeah.  And it's very hard to get thrown out of. 
[02:24:30]  But then we got Linda Blair back on the phone.  We made it all good.  Of course we did.  Everything got better.  Uh-oh, Linda Blair calling back.  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you! 
[02:25:00]  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  She ain't getting no more.  Yeah.  I don't know why she calls back. 
[02:25:30]  That was a good moment.  Cindy Williams.  Mr. DVD, I don't remember.  I don't remember that one either.  Let's try Mr. DVD.  I forgot she called back.  Oh, the Mr. DVD, we did the old silence game too?  I don't remember.  What did Mr. DVD do?  Movie reviews?  Yeah, he would review new DVDs that were coming out.  Oh, new DVDs and all that, sure.  Okay.  Mr. DVD, any more DVDs coming out?  What are the new ones coming out this week?  There's a couple of... 
[02:26:00]  Anthony, he cannot hear us right now?  Yes.  It's time to play the silent game.  Okay.  The Pearl Harbor two-disc set, the director's cut of Almost Famous, which is actually going  to be pretty interesting because I'm more interested in seeing the director's cut of Almost Famous  than I am in seeing the actual theatrical release.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Isn't that the most painful thing to have to sit through? 
[02:26:30]  Did he go like, fuck?  Yeah, he was like, fuck, fuck.  But he did call back.  Oh, he's back.  Hold on.  Let's make like something wrong with the phone.  Mr. DVD?  Yes.  Hi.  Sorry.  We had a new phone system put in.  It's still screwing up. 
[02:27:00]  We didn't hear the last part of that.  Can I ask real quick, too, before you describe this?  Yeah.  Mr. HIV, I wanted to know.  It's Mr. DVD.  Oh, that's so witty.  He's not even calling for it.  What a dick.  Mr. DVD was not having it.  He told me.  He sure did, Jimmy.  And he was right.  It was witty.  That's so witty.  He's blaming Colin for it. 
[02:27:30]  That was Jim Norton.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I know it's something you would have expected out of Colin.  Jim Norton, you're indistinguishable from Colin, and that was so witty.  All right.  So where were we, Mr. DVD?  Pete Johnson's on the phone thing, though.  A bunch of great stuff on December the 4th, including the two-disc set of Pearl Harbor,  which you don't want to rush out and get because you're doing a three-disc set in May.  Let's try this again.  This fool is going for it again.  We're playing a silent game.  He has no clue that we're doing this today.  Also, both Bill and Ted films come out on a 4th as well. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  That time he cursed.  All right.  All right.  That time he cursed.  All right.  That time he cursed.  He's sitting there with Vic.  The phones have been dropping out.  And then he hung up.  You don't think we could get him a third time, do you?  No, Mr. DVDs.  Yeah.  No, we've had...  Are you on a better phone right now?  I think it's us.  Oh.  I did hear something about Bill and Ted.  Both Bill and Ted films come out on the 4th, yes. 
[02:28:30]  Bill and Ted on the 4th.  Anything special with those DVDs?  Not as far as I know, although I know that the one actor, Alex Winter, is probably eminently  available to do a commentary, Alex Winter's career has not taken off as Keanu Reeves has. 
[02:29:00]  I can't take it.  Yes, Jeremy.  Is Steve around?  Steve?  Steve?  Before we...  I have a question for our...  Steve.  Is he working today?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, he's here.  Nice.  What do you want to ask Steve?  Why would he be listening to the show and come right in?  Yes, I'm...  I'm very busy.  You actually have to tell him that we're talking about him.  I'm tracking Gustav. 
[02:29:30]  There's a person in the water.  Yes.  People are asking about the beeps.  I think that we...  That's the only version we got.  Yeah.  That's old stuff.  That's old school.  We had to put the beeps in so we could throw it back on the radio.  Steve, Jimmy's got something for you today.  Can we get him back in on the phone?  Yeah.  Can we get Mr. DVD back on the phone?  What's he up to?  For the Greg and Tony show.  Yeah.  Don't tell him it's us.  He might remember.  Why not?  Greg and Tony. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Can we get him on today, maybe?  Tell him we heard some stuff about him.  We wanted to take on some DVDs and stuff.  Yeah.  So we can get him on now.  We can and let's get out of my way.  Pinch him from the swing and back the other way.  Wow.  You grew back that facial hair quick, huh?  Told you.  Motherfucker.  Told you.  Wow.  Weed.  Yeah.  This will be, by midweek, this will be full gray goatee again.  All right.  Let it go.  He's got two gray hairs.  You are a lunatic.  You have two gray hairs, maybe.  Three.  What are you talking about, gray hair?  They're there.  Gross fast. 
[02:30:30]  That cum fertilizer is amazing.  It's like Jody Verrill.  Jody Verrill.  Why is Jimmy imitating Steve Walk?  Walk like Steve again.  I know it's a radio, but it missed it.  It missed it.  It missed it.  Oh, God.  What are you doing?  He's got some other things he should worry about besides his gray hair.  Oh, damn.  Oh, snap.  Cindy Williams?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We'll do Cindy Williams, too.  There's a bunch of these, but we're going to try to move on a little bit. 
[02:31:00]  But uncomfortable moment with Cindy Williams.  Who played?  What's her name on that show?  Shirley.  Shirley Feeney.  Yeah.  Well, Laverne was more the dikey one.  Yes.  Shirley Feeney was the one who was kind of quiet and prissy, but it turned out that the  big ragu would come in, and she only liked if he were unshowered to straddle her face  and throat fuck her.  Shirley Feeney loved being throat fucked by the big ragu after a bike ride, because his 
[02:31:30]  asshole was notoriously knotted and hairy.  He would sing Rags to Riches and punch her in the face while she blew him.  Must have been a lost episode.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember that one.  Yeah, she'd go two knuckles deep in his fucking guinea keister.  The big ragu.  The big ragu. 
[02:32:00]  Dump in her fucking mouth.  Oh, yeah.  He would actually hold her neck and throat fuck her.  And then come all over Laverne DeFazio's sweaters.  He was actually asked to leave the house for a time because he wiped his asshole with the  L on her sweater in a fit of rage.  And one very, I don't know if it's a coincidence or something, he made an exact duplicate of  the L in cum as he just spewed.  And then they went to the pizza place and he took a shit in Mr. DeFazio's pizza dough. 
[02:32:30]  They had to close the restaurant down because of health code violations.  The health inspectors found feces in his pizza dough.  Because the big ragu took a big hairy shit.  Well, the big ragu took a fucking hangover shit.  A watery hangover shit.  And Mr. DeFazio's pizza dough.  Ah, shit.  That's how it worked out, huh?  Yeah, it wasn't even a solid one that Mr. D could go in there and ladle out. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  It was a fucking liquidy one that got baked in of five or six pies.  People were getting sick.  Somebody finally recognized corn and peanuts.  No, wait a minute.  And some big ragu ass hair.  It was some curly ass hair with a fucking W.  The wrangler thing came off his jeans as he was shitting.  You could shit that bad that you lose the logo off your jeans, Jimmy?  Well, yeah.  Well, you know what it was, too?  They also found in the outside of the dough, they found two heel prints. 
[02:33:30]  Like he had squatted and shit, but two heels went in the corner of the dough.  And somebody went, say, there's heel prints in my pizza.  And they knew it was the big ragu's shoes.  He's always hoofing and dancing, so.  Yeah, they knew, because he had those big, those fucking lifts, those heels.  Well, now at least we know what happened.  That's right.  And remember Shirley, that episode, where she had to go, because she had, who'd they work for?  Shots, remember she was doing that party trick, and she got a Shots bottle in her cunt, and then Fonzie kicked her and broke it? 
[02:34:00]  She was doing the put the beer bottle in the cunt trick, and then fucking Fonzie was practicing his Taekwondo, and he kicked her right, kicked her right up in her fucking bunt, and broke the bottle in her snatch.  That was an ugly one.  Cheryl, Cheryl, she said, I'm bleeding from the baby maker.  How do you not remember that?  How do you not remember that? 
[02:34:30]  From Broken Shots bottle, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I remember that one.  Fonzie kicked her, yeah.  It was right after the shark jumping episode.  I'm going to kick in the cunt.  And that was it.  Yeah.  Hey, um, Stephen asks for Bayshore now, maybe we can set this up for after the break.  Where has stalker Patty disappeared to?  The day of the PNC show, I learned she has no refrigerator in her shitbox of an apartment.  She has to shop every day for her little, pointless, life-sustaining meals.  Ooh, is that what she does?  Well, let's get Patty on the phone and see if that's what that's about. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, well, I don't eat that much, and I can't refrigerate anything, because I don't have a refrigerator.  Yeah, we haven't had her on since she stopped the show with that hypnotizing segment we did with her.  She called me three times last week.  I didn't pick up any time, but she called and left messages each time to ask me if there was going to be a show on Friday.  Is that going to be a show?  Dude, and she left me.  I think I might even still have it.  I hope you said yes.  She just went on.  I didn't call back.  Oh, God, yeah.  She went on and on about... 
[02:35:30]  Because, you know, usually on Friday's, I come down to the show, so it was just...  Like, it went on and on for like a minute long.  Does she still have it?  I think I do.  Let me go look.  I'm listening.  No shutting her up.  Well, after that wonderful setup from Jimmy reminding us of some of the great Laverne Shirley episodes,  here's Cindy Williams.  So, what have you been up to, Cindy?  Nothing, as you know.  Otherwise, why would I be in Has Been Corner?  Oh, wow.  Why did we jump right to this part? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Iraq, explain yourself.  Because...  Come in here so we can make fun of you.  Come on in here, buddy.  Hello, Iraq.  How are you?  Hey, didn't you used to be in that exercise commercial body bike cake?  Okay, first fat joke out of the way.  Go ahead.  No, you started the bit by introducing Has Been Corner,  and she accused you of stealing it from Andy Kaufman. 
[02:36:30]  You said yes.  Which I was, because the beauty of Has Been Corner with Cindy Williams,  I'm a huge Andy Kaufman fan.  She was on Has Been Corner when the great Mr. Kaufman did it.  Well, that first...  And now you fast forward, and that time is a bitch, now she's a has-been.  But at the time, she was laughing her ass off as Andy Kaufman was making someone very uncomfortable  as he was doing it.  That first part was just a little banter back and forth,  but this is where it really started to...  Get the pressing for her?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:37:00]  It got a little too real for her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, what have you been up to, Cindy?  Nothing, as you know.  Otherwise, why would I be in Has Been Corner?  Well, you were on Laverne and Shirley, obviously, the beloved Shirley Feeney on Laverne and Shirley.  And then after that, there was...  What was that?  Oh, shit.  After that.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Oh, I forgot about that.  That's brilliant from Anthony. 
[02:37:30]  Deafening silence.  And then there was...  Oh, it's that time you...  Yeah, listen to this, man.  I forgot about this.  Shirley Feeney on Laverne and Shirley.  And then after that, there was...  What was that?  After that.  There was two kids.  Oh, the two kids got in the way?  Yeah.  That's going to be your excuse?  Do you resent them? 
[02:38:00]  Do you resent...  Oh, shit.  That's going to be your excuse?  Wow, this is just vicious.  We were really mean back then.  I love it.  God, I love it.  After that.  There was two kids.  Oh, the two kids got in the way?  Yeah.  That's going to be your excuse?  Well...  Do you resent them?  Do you resent them for that?  Totally.  Because you were...  Totally, but not as much as I'm resenting you two right now. 
[02:38:30]  No.  What?  This is all fun, right?  So, Cindy, seriously, what have you been doing in the last 20 years?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Okay.  So, like I said, Laverne and Shirley, then...  Nothing.  Was she mad?  Laverne and Shirley, then nothing.  You know how huge... 
[02:39:00]  You know how huge that Laverne and Shirley show was back in the day?  Yeah.  And she was in American Graffiti before that, right?  It was a big drop off.  She was in a movie called The Conversation, too, with Gene Hackman, directed by Coppola,  I believe.  A little picture with Gene Hackman, directed by Coppola.  And Robert Duvall.  I believe she killed Robert Duvall in it or had him killed.  Really?  Hold on.  Yeah, a little movie called 1974.  I'm guessing.  Let's say hi to Dan O. in Kentucky.  Dan O. 
[02:39:30]  Good morning, bu-bu-boys.  Good morning, Dan.  How's Jack Lord?  Happy birthday, Gene.  Thank you.  Hey, I got a question.  Is a bunt and a gunt the same thing as a fupa?  Yeah, pretty much.  They're all that mushy, fat area above the clit and below the chin.  Fupa.  You boys know what that stands for, right?  What?  It's all the flesh around a vagina. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Punch it out, boys.  Have a good morning.  All right.  By the way, just real quick.  Did anybody hear fucking that douchebag, Oberman?  What a fucking douchebag, this guy.  Just morning, Joe, who is a block-headed idiot.  Joe Scarborough?  He's a block-headed idiot.  I've had his fucking rock-em-sock-em robot head.  I spent the day with him, man.  He's pretty cool.  He's a good guy.  Well, I was doing a piece that never really aired. 
[02:40:30]  It was a waste because all the edgy stuff, there's no way they were going to air.  Yeah.  And I sat in Iams' chair back in the day and I farted.  And I took his mic and just did all this dumb stuff and they barely showed anything.  But he's a very cool guy.  I'm sure he is.  Men with square heads are normally very easy to get...  Hey, fucking...  What, was Keith on his show or something?  SpongeBob fucking morning guy.  He, uh...  Thank you.  He, uh...  No, he was calling in or something and Oberman's like,  should you pick up the shovel?  Because he was, like, not bad-mouthing McCain.  Nobody who works with Oberman. 
[02:41:00]  Like, what a fucking scumbag that guy is.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of the Obermans.  He's the biggest douche-your-co-workers fucking scumbag.  He's, uh...  God almighty is he aggravating.  And it's not to do with political views, either.  I'm kind of torn because, uh, he goes after O'Reilly really, really well.  Exactly.  But then he has his own douchiness.  And then he fucking sucks Jesse Jackson's dick.  No, I know.  Then he has his own douchiness.  You're absolutely right.  Because O'Reilly's an easy target in the sense that...  He's an easy target.  Yeah, go on. 
[02:41:30]  He's got a big cock and a lupus punch.  But no one's ever going to fault you for going after O'Reilly.  It's easy.  Yeah.  All right.  More Cindy Williams.  So you don't want to promote that you're going to be at the Meadowlands Convention Center for  the Super Mega Show?  No, but thank you very much for that.  I'll be there at the has-been table.  Signing has been autographed.  Why?  Lindsay Wagner's going to be there as well?  Yes.  You might want to call her.  You got her number? 
[02:42:00]  No.  No, I haven't.  All right.  Hey, I like milk and Pepsi.  That wasn't me.  Oh.  What is that about?  That's what Laverne used to always drink on the show.  Oh.  I'm just pounded.  I didn't realize I was really the head scumbag on this one.  Yeah, you took the lead on this one.  I hope he has some real douche lines too, but fuck, am I being an asshole?  No, you took the lead on this.  Who would know that that was a Laverne thing?  That wasn't me.  It was common knowledge, to be honest, because she would drink milk and Pepsi. 
[02:42:30]  I don't remember that.  What happened was, she would get acid reflux because she was such a cum drinker.  Cum would give her acid reflux because she would drink it out of a fucking glass.  Because Carmine was fucking Shirley, so some of his black friends would come over and jerk  off into a cup for Laverne, and she would drink it.  Just stupid face.  Some bukkake.  And they had to keep it safe for network TV, so they just called it milk and Pepsi.  No, no, milk and Pepsi is what she used to take the reflux because she would have  cum burps, cum bubble burps. 
[02:43:00]  Burp, burp.  So milk and Pepsi would kill that.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Hey, I like milk and Pepsi.  That wasn't me.  Oh.  It was milk and Pepsi.  Remember Laverne and Shirley.  I thought that was Shirley, but Laverne used to drink milk and Pepsi all the time.  All right.  Wow, I feel kind of uncomfortable right now.  I'm overheating. 
[02:43:30]  Boo-boo kitty was you, right?  That's right.  Say boo-boo kitty.  See, I'm a big fan of Laverne and Shirley.  Watch it all the time.  That's great.  So we encourage all our listeners to go to the Meadowlands Convention Center for Super Mega  Show, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, right?  Yes, that's right.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  All right, Cindy.  Okay.  Thanks, fellas.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  There she goes.  Cindy Williams.  Oh, my God.  No.  You know, Opie, don't look so proud of yourself. 
[02:44:00]  You guys, like, your voice is very different.  Yeah.  A lot of people talk about how my voice is different.  I have more of a rasp to it back then.  Yeah.  I've refined it a little more now.  Yeah.  Because you don't smoke anymore.  That's right.  Yes, Jimmy.  Did you?  What was boo-boo kitty?  That was her little, like, doll that she had that would make her feel better.  He doesn't want an answer.  No, I actually did. 
[02:44:30]  He doesn't want an answer to boo-boo kitty.  No, no.  Either that or he does want an answer.  So he can tell us a little tidbit we might not know about the program.  Well, now you remember boo-boo kitty, right, Jimmy?  I vaguely remember, but what happened was we all knew the big ragu was known for his girth.  Yeah.  And he would notoriously fuck her hard.  And when he would tear the lining of her vagina and they would say,  Why aren't you coming into work today?  She would point at her pussy and go, Boo-boo kitty.  Oh, okay.  As opposed to people listening to this who heard that long joke are going, Boo-boo, Jimmy. 
[02:45:00]  I like boo-boo kitty, Jimmy.  I'm a fan of the boo-boo kitty.  That's what happened.  Oh, I know what it was.  Yeah.  After the big ragu wrecked a bunch of Mr. DeFazio's pizzas by hangover shitting his dick.  Right, I remember that now.  He picked him up and he fucking threw one at the big ragu.  But big ragu moved and it landed right on Shirley Feeney's pussy.  And then she had scalded Boo-boo kitty.  And she had to go to the emergency room.  Hot shit pizza.  Hot shit pizza all over her vagina. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  People think I'm making that up.  No, no.  I remember all these episodes.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Yeah, all right.  Kristen Bell.  Sure, we can do that from Heroes.  She's in Heroes, right?  Kristen Bell?  Or was?  I don't watch that show.  Still is?  Okay.  And she also was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, a movie I saw and liked.  And we had a wonderful interview with Kristen Bell, who's been on our show, sitting right  in that seat a couple times.  Yes. 
[02:46:00]  This is how it went down when she was promoting Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  We've got to interrupt this news story.  We've got a big star on the phone.  Kristen Bell, the star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  Kristen.  Yes?  Congratulations on the new movie.  Are you excited?  I'm so excited.  Awesome.  All right.  Anthony.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  So, um.  Oh, no.  Oh, yes. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, Roland is in cardiac arrest.  Oh, no.  See, we still do it.  It's a lot of people.  That was recently.  Oh, see?  We still do it.  Just not as often, because we've got to get some of these guys actually on the show.  Jerry Springer calling in today, matter of fact.  Is he?  Yes.  About what?  America's Got Talent. 
[02:47:00]  What is he plugging now?  I've been hooked on that dumb show.  What's he doing on it?  Is he on it?  Yeah, what does he do?  He's the, uh.  Besides, I have no examples of his show.  He's like the Ryan.  Nothing.  Wait, what?  I mean, his show is terrible.  Maybe I wasn't listening.  Oh.  Let me repeat that.  I was saying that his show is not particularly good.  So, in America's Got Talent, there were no examples of his show. 
[02:47:30]  Gotcha.  See, the people out there are really enjoying it.  Hey, uh, E-Rock, why not, uh...  Stop eating?  One man Star Wars guy.  Oh, sorry.  We were talking to E-Rock.  He's coming in Volume 2.  What?  Oh.  Volume 2?  Oh.  Yeah.  When's Volume 2 gonna be here?  You'll have it for tomorrow.  Alright, Volume 2.  Tomorrow's...  Volume 2.  Why not Volume 1?  He makes Volume 2, so it's like, okay, I didn't do this.  Yeah.  So, there's a Volume 2. 
[02:48:00]  Exactly.  And people are asking for the Bernie Gets, too.  That was fucking scary, man.  Yeah.  Fucking scary.  How come Volume 1 is so lacking?  Boy, the volumes coming up must be really good, huh?  Yeah, they gotta be the best.  Sure.  Sure.  Uh, that's why when you get, like, the second greatest hit CD from your favorite band...  Eh.  Put all the good ones in the first one.  They sure did, Anthony.  They sure did.  Why would you not?  Is, uh, Richard Jenney worth playing? 
[02:48:30]  It's alright.  It's the prison interview, so...  Oh, the prison interview?  Do you want to do this, or do you want to just, uh, leave it here?  Richard Jenney.  Uh, oh, no.  Eh.  Dead guy.  Eh.  Dead guy creeps you out?  Yeah.  He is.  Who's this?  This is Richard Jenney.  Who's this?  Richard Jenney.  Hey, uh, Richard.  It's Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good?  I'm just peachy, thanks.  Uh, when are you coming in?  I was thinking about coming in, uh, today.  Today?  Yeah.  At what time?  Probably about, uh, 4.40. 
[02:49:00]  4.40?  It's what, 4.22?  Yeah, I'm really close by.  Where are you?  I'm actually staying in the lobby.  You're outside the studio?  Yeah, I've been staying in the lobby.  I didn't want to miss you guys.  Hmm.  And you want to come in and do the show?  Yeah.  If it's okay, if you're not too busy talking about Ron Jeremy's, uh, I could maybe stop in.  Well, Ron's coming in, too.  So, you get along with him?  Yeah, you said yesterday, right?  Yes, I've met him before. 
[02:49:30]  Do you want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit.  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  Well, that's where you're on the phone like you are now, and then you step up to the glass  on the door to the studio?  Right.  And, uh, you talk that way?  No, I'm not doing that.  Come up to the glass.  It'll be fun.  It's like Oz.  You ever watch Oz?  Why can't I just come in?  I can't just come in the studio?  Are you worried about germs or something? 
[02:50:00]  Well, it's up to you.  I'm just hoping you put me on.  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Yeah, I'll be funny.  Well, I'm sold.  I'm sold.  Not to put the pressure on you or anything.  Do you got any knock-knock jokes?  He's laughing at the juvenile stuff again.  Knock-knock.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny, you're hearing knock-knock because I'm pistol-whipping Opie and Anthony. 
[02:50:30]  Get it?  Richard Jenny, who?  Oh, sorry.  All right, Richard.  Can you give us a few minutes to think about it?  Yeah, think it over.  Ooh.  Jimmy, just give it a oof.  Yeah, that's, uh...  Well, you know.  We didn't know he was going to kill himself, Jimmy.  No, no, we didn't.  How are we supposed to know?  We didn't.  We used to love the prison visits. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, people would come up to the window and talk.  They were wonderful.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  What do we got?  Oh, yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford getting drunk on TV.  It's pretty good.  What?  Yeah, they drank cocktails on the Today Show, and she got so fucked up, she, like, lost  her thoughts at the end of the segment quickly.  To get her out of it.  Why were they drinking?  I don't know.  We'll find out that info after the break.  Ooh, tease. 
[02:51:30]  And then somebody is helping us out with the show.  I don't know if it's good, but there's a YouTube video making the rounds where they  make fun of the Batman voice.  Oh, really?  Could one of our guys take a look and see if there's anything there?  It's on Instant Feedback.  Paul T. from Hicksville helping us out.  Did you see that yet, Danny?  Is it worth it?  This YouTube video?  I'll take a look.  All right.  We'll look into that as well.  Patty voicemail.  Is it good?  Yeah.  Well, it's funny how she...  It's...  All right.  We'll get into it.  And this, too.  I almost forgot. 
[02:52:00]  What's this?  Just funny porn audio.  Oh.  Made me laugh.  Oh, look at you, Danny.  All right.  Some new stuff for the XMers today.  Sure.  Why not?  Stay there.  All right.  What do we got going on?  We live.  Is the channel back up?  Is it cutting out?  It happens again.  We go home early.  That's what I say.  That's what I say we do.  We teach these guys in Washington a lesson.  We didn't know we were cutting out.  What happened?  I think we only cut out during the commercials or something, right? 
[02:52:30]  Was that it?  The mics are live, though?  I don't know.  Are we back?  Yeah, we're back now.  We're good.  Here, here.  There you go.  Over there.  And then we go over here.  And then we do a little of this and say hi to Brian in Nevada.  Brian.  Hey, Ope.  Good morning.  Happy birthday, little Yimmy.  Thank you.  Ope, like you, I used to caddy.  And I caddied for Ed Asner a couple of times back in the 60s.  Fuck.  And, you know, he was as big a dick as you made him out to be.  But a question for you is, you know, Ope, you've always got that way where you turn these guys furious. 
[02:53:00]  Could you do the same thing again today as the kinder, gentle, or Opey?  Yeah, I sure can, sir.  It's right under the surface waiting to pop up at any given moment.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think I have.  If I ever get back there, I hope I get a chance to swap caddy stories with you.  Because I used to caddy at Bel Air Country Club over in Beverly Hills, Bel Air, California.  And I caddied for some really big people. 
[02:53:30]  Did you caddy for Bob Newhart?  Yes, I did.  See?  As a matter of fact, I did.  He was a caddy.  He played at Bel Air.  Oh, shit.  And, yeah, Bob was a wonderful man.  Yeah, Bob Newhart rules.  Yeah, he was a wonderful guy.  Very quiet and introverted on the golf course.  No, he's not.  He's not dead.  Bob Newhart died.  No, stop.  What are you guys doing?  About two weeks ago.  What?  Newhart died two weeks ago. 
[02:54:00]  No, he didn't.  He did not, Jimmy, you little pee-pee head.  But, anyways, you guys have a great show.  And, yeah, this cutting out shit.  Hey, one quick question, boys.  Why are they preempting the virus on weekends with fucking college football?  Fuck college football.  Well, why don't we ask Danny, because Danny's very happy about it.  Danny, why are they canceling your fine Saturday night programming on Saturday nights for college football?  Well, I was told that it was bandwidth.  So, of all the awesome programming that the combined Sirius XM has, this channel was an appropriate fit to save bandwidth. 
[02:54:30]  So, this is the one.  Hmm.  Not like some...  Us, the weather channel, and the power, the black XM channel.  But there's a lot of shitty channels they could get rid of.  I would not necessarily disagree with you.  How about that cinema...  Cinema...  Cinemagic is kind of cool sometimes.  You're high.  How fucking much pot do you smoke that you think that's cool? 
[02:55:00]  Dude, no, sometimes it is cool.  I tried it.  I'm like, what the fuck is this driver's?  Dude, I was driving around on the Edwards.  Only if they're playing Power of Love by Huey Lewis.  No, the Edwards soundtrack came on, and it was really cool just driving around to that.  It was really weird.  You are so high.  No?  There's a million channels that stink on XM.  You get rid of that old-timey radio.  You're out of your mind.  Yeah, how about run it on the old-timey radio?  Old-timey radio?  Maybe, I'm going to play a guess.  Maybe there's more bandwidth.  They can get more out of this channel. 
[02:55:30]  Maybe they'd have to do five or six to get what they get off.  I'm guessing.  I don't know.  I don't think anybody's going to miss it if they preempt some Green Hornet episodes from 1941.  Yeah, we're doing very well with the Saturday night shows.  Danny does a great job at that, and it sucks that they're being preempted for college football.  Is college football a serious or XM thing?  Well, XM has the college football.  Well, both now, obviously, but it's on the XM platform.  And I have a question for Professor Anthony. 
[02:56:00]  Shoot!  Okay, Professor Anthony, now with the elections, where we have both minorities really well represented on both the Republican and Democratic side,  do you think that the governor of Alaska has enough clout, even though she has a pregnant 17-year-old,  which, quite frankly, I think shouldn't have any bearing whatsoever, to beat Mr. Obama and that know-nothing Joe Biden? 
[02:56:30]  Why do you give the know-nothing label to Joe Biden?  Because I think he's a know-nothing in the sense, I don't mean he doesn't know anything.  You mean he knows nothing?  He's like skim milk.  I like skim milk.  He's like imitation milk.  He looks like cum in your coffee.  He's got no fat.  I think his politics suck.  I don't think he's ever done anything significant.  All right, Anthony, it's Joe Biden. 
[02:57:00]  Tell me how you really feel.  I think, of course, they have a chance.  What am I going to call the election right now?  What do you want me to do?  I think they have a chance.  I think they've got to parade this woman up and down a little bit and show off her good side.  And her bad side.  Well, I think they're already showing her bad side is that fucking womb.  She's kind of a MILF.  Well, that's what some people are saying.  I don't know, man.  I mean, I'm 62. 
[02:57:30]  I'd do her.  Compared to the old white guys we've had forever, yeah, sure, she's hot.  Obama's a MILF compared to them.  She's all right.  Yeah.  Great show.  Thank you very much.  Do you really want to fuck Tina Fey?  Seriously.  If you had the chance.  I would if I could.  You would?  Why?  Yeah, she's a celebrity.  She's funny as hell.  You mean the real Tina Fey for the governor?  Well, I mean, a lot of comparisons that she looks like Tina Fey, so.  Okay, yeah. 
[02:58:00]  I don't think she's that hot, to be honest with you.  I would think Tina Fey had a heartbeat.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  If she had big boobs, then she'd be hotter.  He's too energetic.  I'm 62.  I'm an old fuck.  Shut up.  All right.  The guy's enjoying himself.  I don't care.  It would be an Anthony show.  Fair enough.  What gives would you guys?  Fair enough.  Fuck all you guys.  I love you.  Keep up the good work.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  God bless.  Careful.  Killed in an accident.  He's happy.  Is this good?  He'll be smiling as a drunk driver plows into him, walking across the street with a big 
[02:58:30]  smile on his face.  Anthony?  Yes?  So does Obama have more of a chance now?  Obama?  No, I don't think he's got any more of a chance than he did before.  Now it's like, you can't just pick, I don't know, you can't just pick the two guys kind  of a thing.  Now it's like, all right, black guy and a white guy, or a white guy and a chick.  Like, it's so fucked up right now.  You just, who knows? 
[02:59:00]  It's fun, though, man.  But they got to get this woman out there and start getting her to start talking about  shit that is going to get votes.  She's talking about her son who's going to the army.  She's talking about, she's a proponent of the Second Amendment, which I like very much.  Let's get some more guns.  And other than that, she ran back in Alaska for a little while.  I'll tell you one thing she's not a proponent of, early pregnancy tests. 
[02:59:30]  She might have known, but she's so pro-life, you know.  No, that's what they're saying.  Yeah.  That she's so pro-life that, no, she did get the testing and she knew.  Oh, so she knew.  She knew and she said, well, I'm pro-life.  You know, I have no choice in this matter.  I'm pro-life, but I'm going to go skydiving today.  Then I'm going to fucking scuba dive.  I'm going to get a dune buggy and go on the Baja 500.  And then I'm getting into a gut-kicking competition. 
[03:00:00]  And I'm just going to jump up and down a lot.  Can you add to the pro-life bit by just saying I'm pro-life, but I'm going to.  I'm pro-life.  Follow the format, please.  Yes.  Okay.  I'm pro-life, but I have to enter the belly flop contest down at the pool.  At the frozen lake.  At the frozen lake.  Oh, God.  I'm pro-life, but I also like frozen margaritas.  Yeah.  What's if you drink? 
[03:00:30]  And is that bad?  Like, say you're pregnant.  You took the test.  You're pro-life.  You know your kid is going to come out a little.  Do you start drinking?  What does it do?  Yes.  It might.  Gasoline.  I'm pro-life, but.  What can I do?  Fix it?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  But I think I want to run a marathon.  Pro-life, but.  Yeah, I'm just going to kind of light a barbecue in my bedroom and breathe in for a while. 
[03:01:00]  I'm pro-life, but I also like ultimate fighting.  Yeah.  That's good.  I like to compete in my ninth month.  Yeah.  But, you know, pro-life.  Pro-life.  I would never have an abortion.  No, that would be against the pro-life thing.  No, it's against my politics and religion and everything that goes along with it.  But, you know, I will be extreme skiing out of the helicopters. 
[03:01:30]  Because why should I give that up just because I'm pregnant?  Yeah.  I'm pro-life boss.  I can't wait to have this baby.  I know the tests prove that there is a little problem.  Mm-hmm.  There is a problem, but many parents do raise Down syndrome children.  Sure.  So I have no problem with that, and I am pro-life.  So even if I did have a problem, I would never get an abortion.  I'm pro-life, but I still like running with the bulls. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  So I will be going to Spain.  That's after I go into our local demolition derby that is on.  Big fan of the demolition derby.  All right.  We were just stalling because now the boys out there are in on the bit.  We got Chris C. from Virginia.  I'm pro-life, but I want to beat one of those cannonball in the stomach guys.  Oh, that guy.  The slow motion cannonball in the stomach.  Okay. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, but she's pro-life.  Pro-life.  Yeah, you don't want to get into the baby.  Why should you slow down?  Yeah, I see the women all over New York pregnant, and they're still doing their thing.  Yeah.  You know.  Why not?  Sure.  Oh, boy.  Batman, so the first 40 seconds is good?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw it.  Sorry, Danny.  Turn on your own.  I'm pro-life.  I just happen to enjoy the taste of a morning after pill shakes. 
[03:03:00]  Bill K. from Philly.  It just amazes the listeners.  Hey, Opie.  Again, please tell me you're making retard jokes without a contract.  Oh.  Well, yeah.  That's what we do.  I'm pro-life, but I just enjoy picking up coat hangers with my pussy.  End of bit.  Let's call it.  End of bit.  Very good.  Batman's voice thing? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, like from what I watched, you know, it's amusing, but then it's going to probably  get old really quickly.  All right.  Yes.  What do you want to kill me?  I said, what do you want to kill me? 
[03:04:00]  I don't know if it's just me, but I can't understand what you're saying.  I'm going to die with me, Joker.  Nope.  Still just guttural sounds to my ears.  I'm going to die with me, Joker.  Tell me where they're over. 
[03:04:30]  Don't.  Okay.  We're obviously having some failure communication.  I'm not picking up.  This is probably where I bailed out.  Yeah.  We get the point.  Sure.  Let's go to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean, watch out for...  Why aren't you doing that to me?  Why aren't you doing that?  Kill the Batman.  Kill the Batman.  Everyone has seen Batman by now, right? 
[03:05:00]  That whole fucking ferry boat scene drove me nuts how stupid that was.  It wasn't as bad.  I'll tell you what I...  That's the only part of the movie I hated.  Of course the white guy was the bad guy and the big black guy was the hero.  We get it.  The black guy that is a prisoner still has what?  A heart.  A heart and he's not as bad as you'd think even though he's in prison for doing awful things.  Ugh.  But Hollywood is such...  That was so...  Poor shit.  They're such transparent fucking elitist white bags of shit. 
[03:05:30]  They can't even acknowledge that black people are bad too anymore.  It's all like, let's just make it the opposite.  Like, they're so fucking stupid.  Yeah.  We gotta explain it to you because he didn't see them.  You haven't seen it yet, right?  No.  Wow.  You're one of the lost people.  But I'm getting what you're talking about.  Well, no.  Well, there were two like furries.  Okay.  But you don't want to blow it for Anthony.  It don't matter.  Blow me what?  And the Joker was, you know, testing human nature. 
[03:06:00]  And he had a ferry filled with, like, prisoners.  Bad people.  And he had a ferry filled with business people and families with children.  And then he made an announcement to both boats that whoever blows up...  They each had a detonator for the other boat.  Right.  Exactly.  Sorry.  That's clever.  And then whoever, like, blew up the other boat first, then the other boat gets to live.  And if neither one did it by a certain... 
[03:06:30]  Within 20 minutes...  Then they both get blown up.  Right.  A little less...  A little test.  Nice.  And it was just such hacky shit.  The black guys looking like, give me that fucking button.  I'm a badass prisoner.  Fuck this.  I'll just blow up that boat.  And then the white people were the good ones.  But then...  It was just so awful.  It's always...  They're so...  Every cop is black now.  And it's simply...  Because Hollywood is...  They're such dumb motherfuckers.  Yeah.  They actually think that... 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, that's cool.  That's perfect.  That evens it up a little.  Yeah.  Like, they just...  They're so out of touch.  And I know I'm looking for realism in the movie about a man who flew in a bat cape.  I understand that's silly.  And then black prisoner dude dramatically grabs the button.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh, fuck.  Here we go.  He's going to blow up the white people, obviously.  No.  I'm sure he doesn't.  He throws the button out of the boat.  No one thought he was going to do anything but what he did.  It's just so wacky. 
[03:07:30]  Anyone who knows anything about Hollywood knew.  I looked at Jimmy and just went, ugh.  I will say, though, that Heath Ledger was just as enjoyable this time as he was the first time.  Hey, let's say hi to...  The Batman.  The Batman.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  I do a very good Heath Ledger impression, by the way.  Yeah, let's hear it, Jimmy.  Hey, where's that Olsen bitch?  How do you eat some pills?  Shit.  Oh. 
[03:08:00]  I do all kinds of fucking Heath Ledger.  It's brilliant, Jim.  Thank you.  Sean, what's up?  Uh, I'm pro-life, but I'm still going to do my trapeze act with Michael J. Fox.  I kind of like it.  Okay, punch them.  I don't know.  I think Jimmy wrecked a bit for everybody by going completely over the top with it.  Oh.  You think so?  Yeah, there's really nowhere to go after that.  Picking up hangers with your fucking, you know, horsey pussy little kid.  I mean, where do you really go from there, Jimmy? 
[03:08:30]  Let's break it down a minute.  There's nowhere else to go.  That's true.  Patty, voicemail?  If you want.  All right, this is what...  I'm pro-life.  I just happen to enjoy hammering shotgun shells into my cunt with a mallet.  Hello, Danny.  This is Patty.  Nothing much.  Just wanted to ask...  I love the nothing much.  Like you were expecting...  Oh, God.  Patty's calling. 
[03:09:00]  What's wrong?  I'm at the convention.  I'm a delegate.  It's not like I edited out my side of the...  This is a voicemail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So she just goes,  Holy, Danny, this is Patty.  Nothing much.  You assumed you were saying, yeah.  She wasn't giving you the death call.  And this also, just to set it up again,  this was probably after she had called me like twice already.  So now on the third try, she didn't get me.  So now she's going to leave a message.  I understand what this is about.  She had a questionnaire.  The first question was, 
[03:09:30]  Who...  Wait.  Who am I?  Who are you?  And what are you...  Patty was asking...  Someone had asked Patty.  Someone had asked Patty.  Who are you?  And what is your value as a human?  There we go.  Okay.  You got there.  Yeah.  Not worth it.  Hello, Danny.  This is Patty. 
[03:10:00]  Nothing much.  Just wanted to ask if there's a live show tomorrow  because I've been sort of out of business.  I'm working a lot of hours,  and I'm listening to a replay.  So you didn't run a live show today in XM.  That's all I want.  That the show is live tomorrow.  To know if I could come...  I should come by the studio or not to visit  like I normally would on a Friday in the morning.  Thank you very much, okay?  I'm also saving a trip down there 
[03:10:30]  if it's not necessary to go.  Okay?  Thank you.  Bye.  She's the fucking worst message lever ever.  Oh, my God.  That message was 37 seconds long.  Why don't you just turn on your radio at some point  and go,  Oh, they're live.  It's obvious.  Danny, I've been enough.  There's a live show today.  Just, hey, man.  Businesses are yours.  It's Patty.  Can you just let me know if there's a show tomorrow?  Thanks.  Bye.  Can we get her on the phone?  She's working.  Yeah.  I'm working.  I'm... 
[03:11:00]  Steed Bucks.  Is she there?  Now, where is she?  I don't even know where she works.  Yeah, yeah.  She's still at...  Still at Steed Bucks.  Ooh.  All right.  Funny porn?  You said there.  Yeah.  I was just watching some stuff last night,  and I don't know why,  but this made me laugh so hard.  It's pretty much just like a fat chick  getting fingered in her asshole.  But you got to listen to his voice  and her coming.  It's too...  It made me laugh.  Okay, cool.  Oh, yeah.  That's it, baby.  Fuck your ass. 
[03:11:30]  It's Batman.  Oh, it's Batman.  Let me pop the video up for you guys, too.  Holy shit.  Oh, that's classic.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's it, baby.  Fuck your ass.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Can I make you squirt again?  Here, come.  Come on.  Come on for me, baby.  Come on, baby.  Take me.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I can't.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Come on, baby.  Oh, yeah.  What about three times?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking Shemp.  It sounds like Patrice beginning to laugh every time.  I hear a little Jackie in there.  Old school Jackie.  I'm coming.  Oh, she's squirting. 
[03:12:30]  No, no, no, I'm sorry.  Holy shit.  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God. 
[03:13:00]  That's better.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I was trying to think, who does she sound like?  That is exactly who she sounds like.  I won't back up.  Oh, my God.  Don't forget, baby.  That was sick.  Nice, baby.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:00]  You're going to squirt again, don't you?  Oh, baby.  You're going to squirt again, don't you?  Oh, baby.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Squirt, baby.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:30]  She sounds like Miss Piggy being murdered.  Danny failed to mention this is from the David Duchovny collection.  His favorite.  Yeah, one of his faves.  That's not sexually appealing on any level.  The looks of it are horrible.  The sound is fucking terrible.  Yeah, that is just a bad piece of porn.  His overacted.  Oh, my God.  You like that?  Yeah, I'm going to finger fuck you.  Come on, Rock. 
[03:15:00]  Rock, I'm going to stick my finger in your ass.  Because you can't squirt, Rock.  Dave in Chicago, Deep.  Hey, is this chick getting fucked or she riding the roller coaster?  Yeah.  That is what she's talking about.  Tom in Chicago.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Sounds like every real time in Star Wars, but R2-D2 could show like that.  There's an R2-D2. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, wait.  When R2-D2 gets electrocuted and he goes...  Okay.  It does sound like that.  Can we get that for tomorrow?  That's a really cool show.  Yeah, let's do that.  Yeah.  Right on.  And then finally, we got Kathie Lee Gifford buzzed on the Today Show.  Oh.  What do we know about this?  Who got this for us?  I think Eric did.  She's a size queen.  E-Rock, come in here so we can make fun of you.  All right.  Here's the E to the rock, Jimmy.  Here he comes.  Hi, Eric. 
[03:16:00]  Hi, Jimmy.  Rock.  What's up?  Not much.  Kathie Lee does...  How come Jimmy got a shirt for his birthday from the Nagels and I didn't get anything from  I wasn't aware until it showed up?  Well, whenever it is, it's in April, but I mean...  I didn't get a shirt either.  Like, why do they like...  Why do the Nagels like Jimmy Norton better than Opie and Anthony?  Comment?  I don't know.  I wasn't aware a shirt was here for his birthday until it showed up.  Isn't that odd?  You don't find that a little odd? 
[03:16:30]  That, like, your parents get Jimmy something?  And E-Rock and his girl got me something.  It kind of gives the impression that you don't care, so...  No, no.  Oh, don't get me wrong.  I don't care.  No, it wasn't just him.  His dad got me something.  Eric's dad and Eric and Angela.  I got a couple of shirts from the Nagels.  Well, way to go, Jimmy.  Wow.  E to the rock.  What's this, Kathie?  Have you worn him yet? 
[03:17:00]  What's that?  Have you worn him yet?  Worn him about what?  Are you going to wear the shirts?  It's cholesterol.  You're going to wear the shirts into work tomorrow?  One of the shirts?  I don't wear two shirts.  I think that was...  Okay, I think it would be nice, though.  A show of appreciation.  Why haven't you worn the Nagels t-shirts for your birthday?  One of the shirts.  I was fucking off.  What do you think I wore for a...  On vacation in your house?  Yeah, this one just happened to be here for the weekend.  Oh, you left it there.  You forgot it. 
[03:17:30]  Why haven't you worn the Nagels shirt, Jimmy?  The other one I did wear.  When?  Thursday.  No, you didn't.  To the midnight showing of Batman.  No, that was Saturday.  When you went by yourself.  I went Sunday night to the midnight showing of Batman.  Two words for those shirts.  Cumrag, right?  No.  Cumrag?  It was very nice in the Nagels, right?  I have a notsam.com cumrag.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  He didn't want to give me the t-shirt because I told him that's what I was going to use  it for, and then we had to convince him that, like, no, I'm really going to wear it.  It's that delicate maneuver you got to make to slide the shirt under or whatever it is 
[03:18:00]  and get off the bed without leaving any collateral damage.  What a great idea.  Cumrag.  I'm going to steal that.  I want a Voss shirt or something.  I want to use one of my friend's shirts as a fucking cumrag.  It's got to have their face on it.  Oh, shit.  Without it out.  Without it out.  Oh, that'd be good.  No.  I don't have a cumrag, actually.  I just cum in my hand and lick it out.  Cum eater.  Yeah.  My own cum only, though.  I never use it, but I actually, I know I'm going to probably throw myself under a bus, 
[03:18:30]  but I bought it when I went to see them in concert, but I got a Tenacious D cumrag.  Oh, God.  They sell them at shows.  Why would you get a Tenacious D cumrag?  Because it was fun.  Cumrag?  Yeah, that's how it's sold.  Tenacious D cumrag.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, and it's like teddy bears and unicorns and rainbows, and it just says, Tenacious D on  top, official cumrag on the bottom.  That's pretty funny.  I thought it was Vardy's.  I bought it.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, their CDs are not good at cleaning up cum.  Those guys are too edgy. 
[03:19:00]  What do we got on Kathy Lee Gifford?  Is this worth playing today?  She starts her one-hour segment after the Today Show, where they're just drinking these spiked  watermelon cocktails.  Uh-huh.  And, um...  Why are they drinking on the Today Show?  They explain the first cocktail.  What time, Paul?  What time does your segment start?  10 a.m.?  That's right.  I was looking through TV Guide.  I said, cunt at ten.  That's what that is.  What are we drinking today?  There's too much drinking on the show.  There is too much drinking.  I've just come to work, and suddenly my problems are gone. 
[03:19:30]  Off the program.  We're doing a cocktail segment.  I read that this morning.  Cocktail is what Giff wanted to do to that hooker, according to Star Magazine, right?  You wouldn't give up the old balloon knot, would you there?  That's right.  Starfish Magazine.  But these are cocktails that are for Labor Day.  But that doesn't stop us.  This is Friday before Labor Day.  Friday.  And a lot of watermelons had to die for this.  Boo!  Wow.  Wow.  The silence is definitely... 
[03:20:00]  How great would it be just to fucking throw a watermelon right at their forehead?  Oh.  Just kill it with it.  To fucking kill it with a woody melon.  Labor Day.  And a lot of watermelons had to die for this.  Oh, my God.  And it was worth it.  Wow.  That is good.  What's in that?  I can't drink drinks like that.  Yeah.  I just can't.  Like, an hour and a half later, I just can't keep drinking this.  No, I can't do it.  They're delicious, but they don't like me.  I know.  Yeah.  And that's a strong drink.  Does it make you shit? 
[03:20:30]  I wish I was on the show just once when she said, what's in this?  I would love to have said, a gallon of giraffe cum.  Just to make them go to commercial.  That's...  You cannot recover from that.  No.  You don't just come back to the next segment.  It would ruin the segment completely.  He said, a gallon of giraffe.  We can't have him back.  45 minutes later, she's now buzzed?  Yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[03:21:00]  She was drinking that through the whole show.  Oh, sure.  Here we go.  It'll sound a little different.  It's going to be fascinating.  I don't care what you say.  Now, on to drinking.  Now, more important things.  Okay.  Who are you?  And what are you doing?  Once again, I'm here.  Summer is almost over.  Right now.  That doesn't mean our spirits have to end.  What are you doing here?  Editor of Food and Wine Magazine, Ray Isle, is going to shake the...  All right.  You know what we're going to do.  It's cocktails.  We're going to make cocktails for Labor Day.  What are we making?  We're going to make a white wine sangria, because you like white wine.  A little. 
[03:21:30]  A little.  Sangria is hip right now.  Can you believe it?  Sangria is now hot.  Isn't that funny?  We have 20 sangrias on our website now.  We have 20 different sangrias.  You are so hot.  You're not hot.  You're hot.  I'm so hot.  And we should get mixing here.  So what are we making?  We need ice.  That's the ice.  We're making a great drink called a Belle de Jour.  This is on...  Holy mother fuck.  She sounds like the fucking Alaska governor about a year ago. 
[03:22:00]  Drink up.  Oh, Jesus.  Spartan should have thrown that off a cliff.  Chatty Cathy explains the history of the cocktail. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  And this is a kind of...  Champagne cocktails were hugely popular in the 19th century.  Do you know how it became a cocktail?  How it became...  How the champagne...  Joe told me we should get a...  Yeah.  Let's just get a...  Let's hear it.  Let's get a shot of Joe.  Yeah.  This is a man who just reeks of credibility.  Get that incredible man out there.  He said in colonial times, a man came into a bar, ordered a drink, and said, make it fancy. 
[03:23:00]  So the bartender went outside.  In the yard there was...  Yeah.  A cock.  What?  Did you say a cock?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought she was going to go with a guy and a black guy and a parrot walking into  a bar.  And the bartender says, where'd you get that?  So the...  That's as far as I take that joke. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, wow.  The...  A cocktail.  She's probably going to say that there was a cock and you'd pull the tail feather off  and put it in the drink and that was considered fancy.  There was a cock and it was Frank Giffords and it was covered with shit after he left  that hotel room.  That's right.  You stick that in your drink.  You put it in your water and you have what they call a dirty motor oil.  It's a dirty motor oil with fucking lima beans skins on it. 
[03:24:00]  Into a bar, ordered a drink, and said, make it fancy.  So the bartender went outside in the yard.  There was a cock.  He takes the tail out of the cock, comes in and sticks it in the drink and that's how  you get...  Joe, thank you.  Okay, two minutes.  Two minutes.  Okay.  Grenadine.  Half ounce grenadine.  I'm sorry, but that's educational.  Half ounce...  Half ounce benedictine, which is a cognac...  Your food and wine, you didn't know that.  Oh, yes.  You came here to learn something today.  Half ounce of cognac.  Holy shit.  Oh, I know what she is.  Because when they...  Oh, yes, Jim. 
[03:24:30]  Apparently when she was there, they had to go out and get the cock.  And then they had to get a sock.  And I need something with an R at the end.  But I can't find a sock.  I was getting a cock sock bomb.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  I should be hit with a carrot.  She fucking not only bombed with that story, but she so shook everybody else. 
[03:25:00]  You could tell they're like, all right, let's fucking finish this up.  Before she goes into the fucking history of the cunt tale.  Yes.  This segment was only supposed to be about a minute.  And she kept rambling.  And they're all just trying to ignore that she's even talking, trying to get all the drinks made.  Hammered.  Hammered.  Great.  This is how it ends.  So, what we've got now is a cider, white wine.  All right.  And this is, you've got to measure carefully.  Pour the entire bottle in.  This is finally something I can do.  Yeah.  And then.  Something I've been trained for. 
[03:25:30]  And then a cup of orange juice.  I'm going to dump that in while you're done.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Two limes.  Two limes.  All right.  Two limes.  Juice.  A bunch of beautiful cut-up strawberries.  Do it.  Oranges and limes.  It's beautiful.  It's a white sangria.  With all the, uh, everything.  Cut up the fruit so she stabbed the guy that's talking.  Fag.  Colombian necktie.  She cut his throat and yanked his fucking semen-coated tongue through his neck. 
[03:26:00]  It's a white necktie.  Ray.  Matt.  Rates.  And watch your language.  This is a fantastic show.  Mass.  Mass rates.  Cup and a half of, we're going to use this one because this sits for 15 or 20 minutes.  We're done.  We've got to run.  We've got to run.  Thank you.  Happy Labor Day.  It's been great.  It was great.  We'll be back.  But first, this is today on NBC.  Wow.  Whatever.  Wow.  She was fucked up.  She was wasted.  That was good.  That bitch was zooted. 
[03:26:30]  That reminds me of something I forgot to tell you.  Mom and Sal were over the house because that really reminded me of my mom.  Oh, boy.  Holy Jesus.  Yeah.  Totally intoxicated.  For some reason, she felt compelled to go into the jacuzzi.  She was wearing, like, what she came in, shorts and a shirt and everything.  She went in in that.  Shut up.  It's my mommy.  She went in in that.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[03:27:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Very nice.  And then she went in in that and then decides to change into her swimsuit when she's done  getting her clothes wet in the jacuzzi.  She was hammered.  Hammered.  A lot of beers.  There's no big payoff to that.  Just another mom was drunk story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I went to Patrice's. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, you went somewhere with Patrici.  Patrici's barbecue yesterday.  You did.  Bob, Kelly and his wife.  And we had a nice time.  You were invited.  Yes, I was.  When we invited you.  You weren't.  I told him to invite me to the next one.  I don't know.  He's a very shy guy.  A lot of black people there?  Or does he hang with primarily white people?  Both black and white comics.  Oh, it was.  All comics?  No.  Some girls and, you know. 
[03:28:00]  Broads.  Fucking broads.  Nice.  I knew most of the people there.  It was fun.  Yeah.  Keith was there.  Oh, Bobby Kelly.  Keith was wearing Keith Robinson hat on a fucking.  It was like.  I don't know what kind of hat they used to wear when they sold the papers.  What are those called?  Oh.  A newsy hat.  Extra hat.  Extra.  Extra.  A newsy hat.  But it was almost made of straw.  It was fucking awful.  It looked like a wicker hat.  And so Bob lifted the grill and I threw Keith's hat on the fucking grill. 
[03:28:30]  But he fished it out on time.  That fucking hat was awful.  Who was good, though?  Keith has a nice place.  Does he?  Nice digs.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll never see it.  Why?  I don't know.  It's right outside the city.  Oh.  It's very close.  I thought it was uptown.  Very close.  The fucking worst music ever.  Marina Franklin was playing the music.  It was just like fucking like the temptations and the old slow jams.  Oh, really?  A little soul?  A Motown? 
[03:29:00]  No one liked it.  A little soul.  Everything's wronged out of the barbecue.  Nothing.  If you're fucking Angela Bassett at two in the morning, it's terrific.  If you're trying to have fun at a barbecue, it fucking really puts a big damn cloth on  the moon.  Damn cloth.  Do we have time to play some spaz stuff today?  Sure.  We're talking about that on the Thursday, I guess?  E-Rock, come in here so we can make fun of you.  Here comes E-Rock.  E-Rock's working on some spaz bits that have never been heard by a lot of the XM listeners, 
[03:29:30]  right?  Nope.  Right or wrong.  What do you got coming to 202 in the near future?  Hurry up.  As far as spaz material?  No.  As far as...  There's Urine in the Sky.  Urine in the Sky is a good one.  There's Spaz and the Love Tomato.  Ooh, nice.  I'm trying to find it, but the one where they take the dump on his paycheck.  Nice.  That one's pretty good.  What about Lifestyles?  Oh, the rich and famous.  Oh, that was a good one.  Spaz.  That's the greatest spaz bit ever. 
[03:30:00]  Okay.  I'll put that on.  I didn't have it in the original folder.  I'll go find it.  Yeah, go find that one.  I don't know any of these bits.  Spaz was just a dummy.  A retard.  I vaguely remember him.  I don't even know if I ever met him.  I might have met him once.  I didn't know him.  One of the most asked questions ever was, is this Spaz guy for real?  And to this day, I will say it again.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Because people were like, there's no way anyone could be this stupid. 
[03:30:30]  So it has to be an act.  So.  And his girlfriend, Beba.  Beba, who's now married to Sick Boy.  But he called her Beba.  You got to find Lifestyles.  That's where he bought all sorts of shit on his first credit card.  On his first credit card.  He sent him his first credit card.  And maxed it out in like a day and a half.  That's one of the greatest bits ever.  And he stayed at the St. Regis.  The St. Regis.  He went to a hotel that cost.  How much was it? 
[03:31:00]  I don't know.  It was ridiculous.  It could be 600 bucks.  Something like that.  A little more back then.  I'm not sure.  But he stayed there and got a butler to iron his heavy metal T-shirt.  It's amazing stuff.  But today we brought in Spaz and the giant mosquito.  Are you going to play the long form bit?  We can.  Well, you just got some samples.  These are just some samples, yeah.  Of Spaz from back in the day.  All right.  Let's move on with the giant mosquito, I believe, is next.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we've got a mosquito going around killing people. 
[03:31:30]  Whoa, there he is.  Oh, a giant mosquito seen crossing the Triborough Bridge.  Whoa.  Giant mosquito.  You're convinced that's one mosquito and they're trying to find this one mosquito.  No, what I meant was there's a bunch of mosquitoes under one breed.  So, a giant mosquito breed.  What?  Next thing you know, he's going to say there's a bunch of s*** running away. 
[03:32:00]  The voice of ick in there.  Oh, is that Rick?  Oh, fuck Rick.  Oh, he's got it in the air, though.  Go fuck yourself.  I think it was.  Oh, I thought it was Lynch.  All right.  Oh, that's f***ing Rick.  The voice of ick.  Are you sure that wasn't Lynch?  Trust me, I know that f***ing voice.  Heard it for way too many years.  And I should've.  Ugh.  Yeah, it was out.  Now I'm annoyed.  Oh, was that what it was?  Yeah.  A derogatory term for Asians.  Oh.  Of course. 
[03:32:30]  Then, of course, it was Rick.  He's great at that.  That interview worked out for you, didn't it, Rick?  You dope.  As dumb as they come.  Who beat it?  We had to for the CBS side.  We thought he was going to do something over there.  Yeah, we were taking a plane over there.  All right, and the giant mosquito continues.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we've got a mosquito going around killing people.  Apparently, it affects your immune system and your brain.  It inflamed, it's called, I can't even pronounce this. 
[03:33:00]  Here it goes.  Encephalito.  Anyway, it's just like...  Encephalito.  Look at how hard it's back.  Encephalito.  I don't know.  Encephalito.  It's Homer Simpson, everyone.  Did you figure out how to say that word?  I couldn't pronounce it.  Try again.  I need the word in front of me to pronounce it. 
[03:33:30]  All right, someone give him the word.  I'm sure it's in the newspaper.  Dude, I was laughing so hard, I just started dry heaving.  Are you?  Yeah.  Giant mosquito.  Look for the giant mosquito story.  Rick eagerly looking for the giant mosquito story.  I can't even pronounce this.  Encephalito.  Anyway, it's a mosquito.  All right, I got it.  All right, you got the word in front of him.  All right, go ahead. 
[03:34:00]  Spaz has the word in front of him.  Third death feared from...  Encephalitis.  That's my sister's name.  Encephalitis, you get your ass over here.  Your sister's spatula and the boris inside.  Encephalitis.  Jared P. from Manhattan.  What about Spaz's master plan for a robbery?  I'll cut a perfect circle.  Oh, it was a symmetricized hole.  Right.  It was cutting a perfectly symmetricized hole to commit the perfect crime. 
[03:34:30]  But what did the perfect circle have to do with it?  I don't know, but it was symmetricized and you could get in.  I have no idea.  All right.  And it inflames the outer layer of your brain.  Is that what happened?  The mosquito's carrying.  In severe cases...  In severe cases, these are some of the symptoms you may get.  Severe headaches, muscle aches, high fever, stiff neck, disorientation.  Then you go into a coma, have a couple of tremors, a convulsion or two.  Then you're in paralysis and then could die. 
[03:35:00]  Coincidentally enough, the same thing that happens when I'm listening to K-Talk.  You sure you didn't get bit by this mosquito?  You know, these are the symptoms that people infected have been showing.  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray.  Residents are being sprayed?  The residents are being sprayed?  What?  Dude, no, they're spraying like sumps and stagnant pools of water and brush. 
[03:35:30]  Not the people.  Damn you!  It's a mad house!  So you think they're just running around with this spray and spraying people as they're going about their business?  Super soakers full of DDT.  No, there were tables set up with officers in that outbreak suit.  And they had the cutter and off. 
[03:36:00]  They were just spraying people as they walked by the table.  That's the picture I saw.  Oh my god.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Sounds like a real dope.  A blithering idiot.  You didn't know Spaz?  No.  Wow, you've been around a long time.  That's fucked up.  I might have met him and just not remembered him.  No, I think he had already tendered his resignation.  Yeah, I'm going to resign.  I'm resigning unless you call me Kevin.  Alright, goodbye.  What a dummy.  Yeah, he really is.  What a fucking dummy.  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray. 
[03:36:30]  Now actually, there are ways to prevent yourself from getting hit with this mosquito in Queens.  Hit with this mosquito?  There he tried to say, what's the word?  Encephalitis.  It's like you're from another country, you know?  I'm going to pee myself, I swear to God.  Encephalitis, where's Bactine? 
[03:37:00]  Where's your sister Bactine?  It's still a giant mosquito at this point, Ant.  Yes.  One large giant mosquito.  Thank God they're spraying the residents of Queens.  Just walking around with bug spray.  Spraying the residents.  In Queens, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks when outdoors.  Use insect repellent that includes DEET, D-E-E-T.  Avoid the outdoor activity from dusk till dawn.  Remove water from cars and jars, because that's where miscues later eggs and, you know, settled water. 
[03:37:30]  And check your home for tight-fitting screens and doors.  Much like the rules of, um, going out there in the summer, you know, don't wear heavy clothing, don't run in 100 degree heat.  This is common sense, people.  Follow it.  Wait a minute.  You're telling people to follow common sense.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I am stupefied, man.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  We were really laughing it up there, all right?  That was some funny stuff.  Yeah.  I was, I remember always being just flabbergasted by what he would say.  It's like, this is the dumbest individual.  Uh, and he would read, he would read up on the things and think he had a grasp of, of  the science behind something. 
[03:38:30]  He had the, uh, the knowledge.  I don't know.  Many people should know these things anyway, but of course we got morons on the TV and like  me on the radio right now.  That's true.  Telling you, uh, all the preventing causes to do.  Anyway, uh, we're going to get right back to music and, uh, we're going to kick it off.  All the preventing causes to do.  Preventing causes.  Yeah.  This was his air check.  This actually went on the air.  Obviously we replayed it, but this was, he did this.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's serious stuff on his radio show. 
[03:39:00]  And, uh, we kicked it off.  Actually it would have been a Ren's Robstein.  With Duhast.  Yeah.  Anyway, we got some, uh, more news along the way we're going to talk sports.  After this next song break, there's Duhast.  We are at WICR.  Where we break new ground.  That was good.  I hit, I hit the note.  You know, I hit the post.  Ah.  That's a nice segue from Encephalitis. 
[03:39:30]  Don't you think so?  Encephalitis.  Ah.  People saying, stop.  I can't see.  I'm laughing so hard.  Please, please stop.  Brain damaged.  What are you going to do?  Oh.  Problem?  Mm-mm.  All good.  I suppose I had to take a call there.  What?  Ah.  Oh, jeez. 
[03:40:00]  All good.  And then this.  Imagine Spaz with Tourette's.  It shows drag in a little bit.  You know, I think it would be better maybe because you start out strong and everything.  And it's just like, die, die, die, die, die.  But it's just because sometimes I like to beat the ass.  And it goes.  Girls are coming.  But then I, you know, the rest of it's called. 
[03:40:30]  Woo-ha.  Ah.  Jeez.  All right.  I see the phone calls.  Huh?  All right.  What?  I don't know what the hell we were thinking.  Like, it might sound a little like this.  Ah. 
[03:41:00]  Yes.  Let's say hi to, uh.  Oh.  We have to interrupt that because we got the great Jerry Springer on the phone.  Jerry.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  What's wrong with your voice, Jerry?  I thought he's Batman.  I don't know.  Maybe it's early.  But no, I'm feeling good now.  Oh, good.  You were forced to get up to talk to us today?  No.  I wanted to get up to talk to you.  Ah.  I don't care what time of the day it is.  Get me up.  Jerry, what are you doing for America Has Talent?  They say that you somehow are part of it.  The talent just has no taste.  You're crazy, Jerry.  Jerry, what are you doing for America Has Talent? 
[03:41:30]  I'm the host of the show.  I'm the guy in the suit.  You'll recognize me.  I got the glasses on.  I'm right out there.  Now, it's a popular show.  Is he working with Sharon Osbourne?  Yes.  The judges are Sharon Osbourne, David Hasselhoff, Pierce Morgan.  Well, yeah.  Jerry plays the Ryan Seacrest role.  Oh.  Sorry.  No, I mean, if you know American Idol.  Ryan Seacrest, Jerry Springer.  Well, they're doing the same format as American Idol, but it's with Axe.  Well, it's the same guy, Simon Cowell.  Yeah, and you're doing the Ryan Seacrest. 
[03:42:00]  You're on stage to talk to the Axe after they do their thing.  Right, right.  And then you've got the three judges, the English douche that has to be a douche because that's  his role.  Right, Jerry?  He's British.  Wow, yeah.  See, they have a class society compared to America where, you know, we live on the premise  that we're all the same, but the idea of having two of the three judges being Brits who tend  to be more judgmental and, you know, kind of just looking down at us and saying, well,  you're good, you're not, you know, that kind of thing. 
[03:42:30]  Right.  It probably adds some edge to the show.  Yeah, and then you've got David Hasselhoff.  He just loves everything.  He's the American representative.  He just loves everything, though.  He what?  He loves every act.  Yeah.  There's nothing bad to say.  Huh?  If you're the Hoff, you love everything.  He's like the Hoff.  Could you please not call him that?  Don't play into that.  No, you have to.  He's the Hoff.  No, he's not the Hoff.  You have to call.  When you see him in the hall, say hi, the Hoff.  What, what, on the floor eating a sandwich?  Hey, the Hoff. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, you've seen that video, right, Jerry?  My brother was drunk.  He wanted a burger, and he didn't take it off the floor.  He certainly did.  He's like the Paul Abdul, though.  You know, he might be under a little influence, and he likes everybody.  You don't know what you're going to get.  Right.  And then you've got the lovely Sharon Osbourne.  She's lovely.  I mean, actually, she is.  She's really neat.  Do you know she married to Ozzy?  Yes.  I met him last week.  The first time.  He was at the show.  He was on set?  No, not on set.  He was sitting in the audience, and I went up there. 
[03:43:30]  You know, I saw him there, so I just said hi.  Yeah, very good.  I did very well.  Did you like the way I said hi?  I didn't see that one.  I was watching.  Thanks a lot.  I'll send you the tape.  No, what happened, Jerry?  I'll tell you what happened, and I think this is why you're on our show today.  Yes.  I was really getting into America's Got Talent, and then next thing you know, there was something  called the Olympics on for two weeks.  Oh.  And took the rhythm away from the show.  I was really excited.  I was into it, and then all of a sudden, I'm like, and then it was back on.  I got all confused. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  In other words, in key moments in your life, you can't be interrupted.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah, Jerry.  You got to be young to get it back.  And what's going on with Sharon Osbourne's face?  It smiles.  Yeah, but you know what?  I noticed she's doing the plastic surgery thing, which is okay, but I think she might  be going a little too far, and I think, Jerry, it's up to you to tell her that.  I was going to have a facelift.  I've been thinking about it, but I think I'm going to have my body lowered. 
[03:44:30]  It's cheaper.  Oh.  Boo!  Boo!  Hey, I'm going to be on.  If you want Jerry to stay on, call 1-866.  So, we got America's Got Talent.  It's happening.  What are you down to?  How many acts?  We're now down to 35, the final 35.  The final 35?  Last week, five got eliminated.  Tonight, you're going to see which other five got eliminated, plus you see 10 new acts, and  the same tomorrow night. 
[03:45:00]  We go now through October 1st, all the shows are live.  Jerry, let me tell you something.  I'm going to prove that I watched America's Got Talent.  You felt very awkward when they kicked off that little girl, I think it was last week.  And she was crying her eyes out.  Oh, right.  Yeah, the little girl from Elite.  Yeah.  And no one knew how to tell this girl to beat it.  Beat it, stupid.  You lost, and it's time to leave.  They had to like, oh, no.  Well, I was holding her hand, and then one of the guys from the other group, the James 
[03:45:30]  gang, picked her up and carried her off.  Yeah.  Yeah, but they had to give her a standing ovation, make her feel good.  It was live TV, so you see Jerry there panicking, because you know he's getting the signal,  get this loser off the stage.  But Jerry had to play it right and hold her hand, and then they had to make her feel good  before they kicked her off the stage.  There's this cue card that they hold up and says, hold hand.  You should have just...  Someone else came with a cue card and said, move right.  Yeah, you should have gotten your old buddy Steve there to just yell at her. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, because that's what he does on his show.  Oh, yeah.  He just does a lot of yelling.  What do you produce that show?  No.  I'm one of the producers.  You're one of the producers?  Oh, you had to figure Steve wasn't just going to leave and...  I don't do anything on it.  Oh, you mean Steve's show?  Well, you know, you've got to make a couple of bucks there.  I have expenses.  I have expenses.  I hear you.  Jerry, uh...  I have three more payments on my suit.  Of course.  Jerry, are you into the porn?  Uh, no.  Um, I'm too old to remember.  Nah. 
[03:46:30]  No, of course I am.  Yeah.  Do you click around a little bit?  You what?  Do you click around a little bit, see what's on the internet?  Well, actually, I do not do that, but that's primarily because, um, I don't use the computer.  You know, I don't have email.  I don't use the computer.  Yeah.  Why?  You know what?  I really enjoyed the 20th century, and I'm trying to stay in it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you're one of those guys.  Yeah, I know.  It's horrible.  It's the same guy that wrote a check for a hooker, remember?  Jesus Christ, Jerry.  Yeah, with the fucking times. 
[03:47:00]  Jerry, you would love Craigslist.  What are you waiting for?  Yeah, exactly.  That's probably why Jerry just knows he'd be in such trouble.  He'd be following David Duchovny to rehab.  Yeah, be like, all right, send over five whores.  Now, what do you have to click for that?  Oh, there's a plan.  Just ask Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  He knows everything about it.  But you'll find porno the second you turn on a new computer.  It's that easy.  Believe me.  I'm just watching the news. 
[03:47:30]  That's enough.  Hey, Jerry, that Britney Spears lookalike?  Oh, that'd be great.  Yeah, the guy who plays Britney Spears on the show.  Yes.  Did it make it wiggle a little bit?  Did it get a little turned on by her?  Him?  Him?  What are they called?  The shim?  Yeah, but I don't think it's going to last.  You know, I think I'm going to break up today.  Jerry's just working with us.  I love it.  He's working with me. 
[03:48:00]  I love it.  Yeah, no, it's over.  It's over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden, you know, he's just becoming too big for himself.  And then, you know, what happened to me?  Yeah.  Hey, what's the deal with that half a guy on your show?  Yeah, Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he was a guest on the show several years ago.  We've had him on a few times.  And then, you know, this is a great way for him to have a job.  It just freaks people out. 
[03:48:30]  He's there to freak people out.  But everybody, like, asks, and I'm sure, it's like, how does he function?  Does he have everything except legs?  Or is there no dick there?  Or no asshole?  Like, what?  You know, I mean literally asshole, because there's plenty of assholes on the stage.  We've seen that.  Yeah.  I'll be honest.  When I meet someone, I don't ask about all their body parts.  Yeah, but you have to with a guy like that.  He ties that shirt up, and you're like, what else does he tie it up?  Where does he fit a, you know, a schlong or something? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  I guess that's one of the great mysteries.  We'll just have to.  Yeah.  Or ask him out.  No.  That's okay.  Well, you were ready to go out with Brittany.  I was not.  That was Opie.  No, I was asking Jerry if his thing moves, because...  Yeah, I always mix you guys up.  I would run like a fucking scared bitch if that guy came up to me with the fucking, just  his arms.  He's very scary looking.  Right.  So, Jerry, are you still doing the Jerry Springer show, or... 
[03:49:30]  Yes, 18th season.  Of course.  When do you start filming again?  Oh, we are.  I mean, I, you know, in the beginning, two days a week, I, in Chicago, taping that show,  and then I fly out here to L.A. to do the America's Got Talent Live.  So I'm in L.A. right now, but, and then the week, I head back to Chicago.  So I'm back and forth.  Very cool.  Oh.  Yeah, so America's Got Talent's on tonight, right?  Tonight, tomorrow night at 8, yeah. 
[03:50:00]  And we're down...  Yeah, what do you got in store for us?  Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me, yeah.  What was the...  There was some, um, some, um, teary eyeball, uh, stories this year.  You had the, uh, the, the woman that raised her family and, and, uh, blew off her singing  career, and now she's in her 40s and just rocking the house, right?  Yes.  See, I watched the show, Jerry.  You are now my best friend.  All right.  We'll be in the top five.  All right.  What do you think of scat porn?  Good?  You ever see...  What do I think of what?  Two Girls, One Cup.  You ever see it? 
[03:50:30]  Are you a fan of the Two Girls, One Cup stuff?  Scat?  No.  You ever hear scat porn?  No.  Or are you more a Booyah guy?  Bukkaki?  Booyah.  Yeah.  You gotta get online, Jerry.  You know, I know.  I am so out of it.  I'm really embarrassed.  Wow.  Jerry, next time you come to New York, we're gonna, like, uh, we're gonna, like, tie you  down to a chair and make you watch the Booyah video and the Two Girls, One Cup thing.  You had me at Tie Me Down.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Then, Jerry.  Jerry.  Oh, you did.  It's a goer.  Anthony, why don't you explain Two Girls, One Cup to the great Jerry Springer? 
[03:51:00]  Well, Jerry, uh, there's two girls and they appear to just be having some kind of a run-of-the-mill  lesbian experience.  You can appreciate that, right, Jerry?  And stuff, stuff you've seen on your show, our breasts, seen it on your show, this is  nothing new.  Um, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the, the, the camera cuts to, uh, one of the woman's  backsides and there's a cup, um, uh, in the picture and she blasts out a big brown  load of shit in this cup that looks like Carvel. 
[03:51:30]  Hello, hello, hello, are we on?  And that, yes, yes, Jerry.  And then the other girl starts eating it.  She starts eating it.  Get him on the show.  That'd be great.  Yeah, you don't want to lose that cushy job you got right there.  Believe me.  Yeah, Jerry, oh, you got, we got your back?  Oh, we got Jerry back.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, what part did you miss, Jerry?  Jerry, what part did you miss?  We missed everything.  Oh, my God.  Should we start over?  What did you miss, Jerry?  The game and Obama, unbelievable.  Yeah, what are you thinking about that? 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, well.  You know, the whole, what about the, uh, the, uh, Republican, uh, vice presidential  candidate now, the, uh, woman?  Yeah, well, I, I think that's great, but I, I don't like in either party the idea, and  I haven't liked it for years, the idea that one person, even though that person won the  primaries and gets the nomination, we may love the person or not, but one person gets to  choose how, who our next president might be.  I mean, it is important enough for us to vote for who the, this president's going to be. 
[03:52:30]  Why don't we get to decide who the next one would be if something happened?  So, basically, Jerry's saying he doesn't like, one person says, ah, I don't like this lady,  she lives out in Alaska, let's ever be the next leader of the free world.  Got to give it to Jerry, that's a good observation.  That is such a good point.  That has never been brought up before.  Jesus.  So, basically, you're not a fan of the broad with the, uh, with the, uh, you know.  Well, she may be fine, no, Jerry, with the, uh.  But that'll end up on your show.  Yeah, we know.  And why, and why don't we take the word of one person?  Whatever happens to, you know, people getting to vote and decide. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  You might want to, uh, send your recruiters to Alaska.  Well, there's an act up there you might want to check out.  Well, Jerry, don't you think that they...  I don't think.  Don't, no, no, no, Jerry, you do.  Don't you think that they talk it over by committee of some sort?  Well, I'm sure he has his people, because whoever gets, whoever becomes the presumptive  nominee gets to kind of be in charge of the convention and everything.  And, yeah, sure, they have people that, you know, gave him a list, and he, but he only 
[03:53:30]  talked to her once.  He only met her once.  Yeah.  And, you know, now we're starting to find out additional stuff.  Not that any of it is bad, but it's just the idea.  I don't care if she turns out to be perfect.  What is, this is a democracy.  It's not American, the American people that are choosing.  The next leader is going to be.  Right.  If it becomes...  You know, the only relevance a vice president ever has is if, God forbid, something happens  to the president.  Yes.  Otherwise, there's no constitutional relevance.  There's no function, other than presiding over the Senate, which is, you know, just not 
[03:54:00]  done for any real legal reasons, unless it's a entire vote.  Sure.  It's all ceremonial.  Sure.  So what's the point?  I don't get it.  And vice presidents often do get to be president.  So why didn't we get a chance to vote on this?  Jerry, who are you voting for?  I'm voting for Obama.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I've voted for Hillary, but I'm voting for Obama.  You're voting for Hillary, huh?  You're voting for Hillary.  Why?  Why?  Why Hillary?  I think she would have been a great president.  She's great.  Great?  How about a...  Really?  Hmm.  Yeah.  I don't think we could talk ever again. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  We can't talk to you anymore, Jerry.  Our political views are very, very different.  That was a feel-breaker?  Yeah, right there.  What if we just decided to get back together again after the election?  Yeah.  What kind of porn do you like, Jerry?  I don't agree to disagree.  You're a lonely man.  Yeah.  I'm going to ask Jerry about what kind of porn he enjoys.  Why?  I want to know if you're so interested in it.  Why are you in radio?  Are we...  He likes certain...  Actually, I know what Jerry likes. 
[03:55:00]  It's fat women that are topless that want to fight each other.  Because that's pretty much what you see on a daily basis.  Jerry...  Charging rhinos.  Isn't that wonderful?  I blame you.  You have to explain to us ahead of time if we're talking to old school Jerry Springer  or the new network TV Jerry Springer.  See, we know how to play along here.  It's the same person.  It's just one wears a suit.  Yeah.  One's got to kind of be good.  One that loves his cushy job. 
[03:55:30]  No.  He doesn't want to ruin it by answering questions by Opie and Anthony.  No wacky shenanigans when you're...  I will.  I mean, I'll answer.  I mean, I'll go, uh-huh.  You're...  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Huh.  Jerry, speaking of politics, are you bummed out that there was never a phase two?  There was never a who?  A phase two.  A phase two?  Yeah.  I don't know what phase two is.  Isn't that awful?  Oh, no.  Hmm. 
[03:56:00]  You're never going to have me on again.  No, that's okay.  No, no.  I can be wild and crazy.  Yeah, we know...  We know you, Jerry.  No, that's all right, Jerry.  You what?  You're the king of wild and crazy.  Everyone knows that.  I can watch that show of yours.  Jesus Christ.  It's a freak show.  I don't remember that they're on.  It's a snile.  What about, uh...  You know, I come down...  That show, I opened the show, it's sliding down that pole.  Oh, really?  Well, thank you for watching a lot.  Well, I'm just saying...  Oh, oh, I thought you meant the Britney Spears guy. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  You slid down his pole.  Jerry, I do watch.  What about the black singer that brought the house down and everyone was crying?  He was a poor kid from Harlem or the Bronx or something.  Yeah, no, no.  I mean, on my regular show, I open the show always by sliding down.  Oh, you slide down the pole.  Right.  I've seen that.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, no, I worry about that because, you know, I kind of get dizzy.  I'm getting up there in years.  Yeah.  That's how my career is going to end.  I'm going to step into that and then slide down and I'll lose my grip.  Oh, how great would that be to end your career that way? 
[03:57:00]  You would like that.  If it happens, I hope it happens.  You're sweet.  Jerry, do you get the funny feeling when you slide down the pole, though?  Yeah, do you push your hips forward?  Oh, let's do it.  Do you slide down?  Do you do the hip push?  Let me show the inside of your cock head, like, hits the pole.  You clench your cheeks and push hard against the pole.  It doesn't matter what I say.  You guys just keep talking.  We're just fine.  Oh, sorry, Jerry.  Did we interrupt you?  We really had a three-part question there. 
[03:57:30]  I'm sorry.  Three-part question?  We're just babbling to Jerry.  Well, Jerry, you know we love you.  I know you'll...  You guys are great.  And I really do like...  Thank you, sir.  Who forced you to call us today?  What?  Who forced you to...  I don't know.  Speak to the guy here with the gun.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I...  Gotcha.  All right, Jerry, so...  I will never not talk to you.  How's that?  Yeah, I like that.  I like that, too.  America's Got Talent.  It's on, I don't know, pretty much every day of the week.  Jerry, 35 acts we still got to go through? 
[03:58:00]  That's a long time.  I know.  Good Lord.  I hope they give me breaks.  And there's a rumor out there that it's fixed, and that the opera singer, singer, excuse  me, is going to win the whole thing, and it's predetermined.  Yeah, it's absolutely not.  And here's the thing.  First of all, it doesn't even make sense.  You know, the people vote.  And, you know, that's all.  I mean, boy, people go to jail for a long time if they ever mess with something like  that.  And secondly, what would the purpose be? 
[03:58:30]  I mean, why not?  If the people vote, why, from television's point of view, would you want to put anyone  on that the people didn't vote for?  So, in other words, it's in everyone's interest that you let the public vote, because then  you know you're getting the most popular one on.  So, yeah, no, that's garbage, if anyone ever says that.  Are you a big man?  No.  Where it counts?  Do I wear a count?  I wonder.  Well, I did, back in 90, back in 94, I did a knee bend. 
[03:59:00]  Right?  What does that mean, Jerry?  He did a knee bend.  Oh.  That was the last time he exercised.  Oh.  I don't, yeah, no, I don't.  Yeah.  Because you sweat.  Jerry, I can't believe that the great Jerry Springer, with the type of show you do, you're  not on the internet.  I think you're lying to us.  You would find half your show topics online.  Well, you know, the people who produce the show, I'm sure, do.  I mean, I see every one of them looking at that screen and, you know, using, they got 
[03:59:30]  a key, what do they call it, a keyboard, and the letters are out of order?  I mean, you know, what's that about?  Why not do it alphabetical?  Yeah.  Looks like, you know, one of Americans don't know how to spell.  You look at a typewriter, what's a typewriter?  And they have, you take out a typewriter, and the letters are just wrong.  Yeah.  We get it, Jerry.  No, I don't. 
[04:00:00]  I screwed it up.  We get it.  I beat a bunch of hoes.  I didn't get it up.  You're supposed, I'm supposed to pause.  Yeah.  It didn't work.  It didn't work.  No, it's okay.  You can't bat a thousand.  We get it.  He's trying to throw the government off.  We get it, Jerry.  Nothing to see on your computer.  We get it.  Yeah.  We get it, Jerry.  That takes a lot.  All right, guys, I really have to go.  Well, of course, they're telling us you've got to go.  Yeah, I think you've got to go, Jerry.  I don't want to, because you're the most fun to talk to.  Of course.  How many of these do you have to do today? 
[04:00:30]  It's a two-hour show.  They're ten acts.  Well, first, we're going to get the results.  No, Jerry, that's not what I was asking.  What did you ask?  How many of these interviews do you have to do?  Oh, oh, oh, I thought you meant how many acts tonight.  How many interviews?  I think there were, like, ten.  Oh, Jesus.  Really?  One after another?  But you're the best.  Are you into, what is that, Jimmy, the cuckold?  Are you a cuckold?  Cuckolding.  Are you into cuckolding?  Cuckolding?  I think it was during English Lit. 
[04:01:00]  Can we at least explain that one to you?  I used that phrase.  Jimmy, could you explain this to the great Jerry Springer,  one of the great hosts of America's Got Talent,  which is on three or four days a week?  There are men.  And cuckolding is this.  A man, when he's with, whether it's his own wife or his girlfriend,  whatever the situation may be.  Sure.  Who enjoys watching his lady be with other men  while he sits there and watches.  Kind of a humiliation thing. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, how about that, Obama, huh?  I'll see you later, guys.  Okay, Jerry.  Okay, Jerry.  Take it easy, sir.  We'll see you on America's Got Talent tonight.  It's so big.  It's about the biggest radio studio I've seen, to be honest.  What?  Our studio?  Where you do the show.  Yeah.  I mean, when you walk in there, it's, you know, normally you walk into...  Oh, it's fine.  And a lot of times, she'll taunt the guy.  Yeah.  She'll taunt the guy, like, with the guy, like, with the cuckold guy. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  It's usually a black guy, and she'll be like, oh, he's so much better than you are.  Yeah.  And, like, the husband or boyfriend sits in the corner and just kind of takes it.  Yeah.  And a lot of times, she's on cleanup duty.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, guys.  Jerry?  Yeah, Jerry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, hey, lots of luck to you.  No kidding.  Hey, no kidding.  Okay.  I'll talk to you later.  Take it easy, Jerry.  The bull makes a deposit.  The husband or boyfriend.  The bull. 
[04:02:30]  The bull.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  This line of the day is sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive, so you never have to worry about losing any  of your files.

[04:03:00]  Interesting.  Sorry to interrupt the runner-up line of the day.  What the fuck does he want?  Well, maybe he misses a boost.  Yeah, whatever.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Well, now he's talking about the fact that there are no black people in Alaska, and he  doesn't...  And what does that have to do with anything?  Well, he's trying to show what he knows about this.  Good things about Alaska.  Jesus.  Ouch.  Right on, man.  That was a good one.  Yeah, that was fucking good, yo. 
[04:03:30]  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  And in the next panel, Beetle says, wow.  My head hurts and he goes to the doctor.  Beetle?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hey, hey, hey.  My head hurts.  He goes to the doctor.  You guys think Jerry enjoyed his interview today?  Oh, yeah.  No.  He got us at the end of the show when we're kind of, like, winding down.  Yeah.  I think he enjoyed his interview as much as George Harrison enjoyed having a cup of hat 
[04:04:00]  stew.  Oh, God.  Sir, there's oatmeal on your chapeau.  It's okay.  That's me brains.  I should go to the doctor. 
[04:04:30]  He'll probably just give me some aspirin.  No.  Sorry, George.  Oof.  You gave him an ibuprofen the size of a hockey rink.  Chew on this.  Oh, poor George.  That's terrible.  What are we up to? 
[04:05:00]  Hmm?  Two Beatles dead.  One more runner-up line.  That's right.  The White House barber's going to have to learn a new cut.  Oh, my God.  Start renting some Three Stooges and some old Reds games.  Oh, my God.  I may be laughing really hard. 
[04:05:30]  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  And there are black people in Alaska.  They're Eskimo foes.  There's a person.  There's a person stranded. 
[04:06:00]  Ah, nice.  That's it for today.  Yeah, that was good.  Yeah.  All right.  I got to make wee-wees.  Me too.  Yeah.  Is it a coincidence?  Nope.  What?  I just bailed out of what I was about to bomb with.  Dude, what were you going to say?  I was going to say, Anthony said I had to make wee-wees.  I was going to say, is it a coincidence that you have to make wee-wees and I have to make drinkies?  That's not bad. 
[04:06:30]  It's fucking horrible.  I kind of like it.  Yeah.  You want to like it because conceptually it's gay and piss drinking in the same show, which  is normally the formula for a winner.

I get to have a show now?  Oh, it's the Danny show.  Boy, did we call that shit in.  Oh, my God.
