<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a fiery discussion about the World Series between the Yankees and Phillies, marked by copious profanity and insults directed at both teams and their fans.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony,  focused heavily on a Philadelphia newspaper's premature victory declaration, exploring the "jinx" aspect humorously. They dissected a specific game, criticizing Yankee pitching and praising the Phillies' offense with equally vulgar language.  A listener call further fueled the heated baseball debate.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about Ozzy Osbourne's appearance on WWE Raw, sparking a debate about whether it constituted a "sellout" moment.  A contentious and profane argument erupted between a caller ("Jimmy") and a host regarding the definition of "sellout" in the context of Ozzy's career, encompassing commercials and TV appearances.  This debate continued with additional callers, even after the introduction of upcoming guests Sharon Osbourne (who was mentioned as an upcoming guest) and the announced in-studio appearances of Sharon Osbourne, Bret Michaels, and Jodie Sweetin, along with a call from Maria from the WWE.  The hosts speculated about the guests' potential participation in *The Celebrity Apprentice*, suggesting it was a publicity stunt.

Anthony then shared a personal security concern, prompting a discussion about home invasions, the need for home security measures (including safe rooms and gun safes), and gun laws,  fueled by a recent Long Island home invasion and strong opinions on the Second Amendment.

Jodie Sweetin, author of "Unsweetened," joined the show next.  The interview revolved around her memoir, detailing her struggles with cocaine and meth addiction and her recovery.  The hosts playfully teased her about her past on *Full House*, her substance abuse struggles, her divorce, and her current life, also mentioning Bob Saget's contrasting public and private personas.  The conversation included sexually suggestive and crude humor.

Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels then joined the in-studio segment.  Their discussion was highly informal, focusing on their (non-existent) feud and the promotion of a 24-hour fitness rock star boot camp.  The conversation was filled with jokes and anecdotes, often sexually suggestive and offensive,  touching upon topics such as Ozzy Osbourne's personality, David Hasselhoff's German popularity, Chuck Liddell's post-fight demeanor,  the hosts' experiences with celebrities,  Bret Michaels' "Rock of Love" show,  Susan Boyle's appearance,  a fall Bret Michaels experienced on stage, and additional sexually charged humor focused on Jody Sweeten's appearance.  The segment concluded with continued promotion of the boot camp and further off-color jokes.

The broadcast then featured a brief, nonsensical soundbite from a British talk show, leading to a comparison of British and American talk show guests and booking practices, criticizing many famous actors as poor interviewees.  The hosts then promoted a comedian, Jimmy, and his upcoming Houston stand-up gigs.  The conversation shifted to a news story about a peeping Tom at a Family Christian Bookstore, sparking a vulgar discussion about hidden cameras, pornography, and the hosts' preferences regarding such content.  A news story about a Bronx high school teacher sharing explicit stories with students led to a comedic segment about absurd masturbation objects. A news story about an apartment complex banning flags sparked a heated, offensive debate about politics, liberalism, taxes, and the political climate, including a Jack Cafferty segment criticizing Obama’s tax policies.  A story about a Boy Scout troop leader arrested for having sex with a minor prompted further vulgar discussion of sex and double standards, with personal anecdotes from the hosts.  Finally, an Anna Nicole Smith video depicting her in a seemingly drug-induced state led to further discussion of the video and the hosts' opinions on the deceased celebrity.  The show concluded with the hosts selecting a bizarre news story about a woman finding the word "GOD" burned into salami.

A later segment heavily featured a vulgar discussion about pubic hair, with Opie describing his preferences using crude and graphic language, accompanied by images provided by a staff member (Danny).  Two 911 calls—one about loose cows and another about a beer-smuggling woman—were played, prompting further crude and sexually suggestive remarks.  A reminiscence about a former guest, Mindy, and her beer-swallowing stunt concluded this section. The show ended with promotion of upcoming tour dates.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal.  The Opie and Anthony on satellite radio shows host Anthony Camilla and Grant Opie here.  Controversial team.  Good comment.  Profanity link with Anthony.  Opie and Anthony apologizing for yet another raunchy gag.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Is this the last straw for the raunchy radio duo?  The raunchy radio duo?  Disturbed and deviant.  There's nothing I enjoy more than drunken teen girls.  The history of misogynistic behavior. 
[00:00:30]  Home of incest and anal sex.  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.  I am a fucking lunatic.  I love it.  What a freak show.  What a Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey freak show.  Best of our abilities.  We'll try really hard every day.  What are we going to do?  Best of our abilities are a good show.  This is what the show is.  It's silly.  It's stupid.  Whatever you want to call it, listen to it and like it or don't.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Uh-oh. 
[00:01:00]  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Are you feeling it?  No.  It's in the air.  Uh, very, very ugly, uh, opening, very ugly opening salvo in the Yankee-Philly game last  night.  But, uh, you know, what are you going to do?  All right.  They, they, they got it. 
[00:01:30]  They, they, uh, pasted us up until, you know, the eighth.  I was, I was, I was, I was pretty, I had a little, I had a little confidence going there.  Uh, eighth, ninth inning.  You thought the Yankees might just pull it out?  I'm like, you know something?  Ah, the Phillies got bored.  These fuckers might do something here.  Have they tied it at all or no?  No.  No.  No.  The Phillies just got bored, Anthony.  No.  Shut up.  They just got bored.  Look, it was three fucking games.  The game was over after the second inning, so they're just sitting there like, la, la,  la, la, la.  It was three games to one.  Now it's three games to two. 
[00:02:00]  What are you going to do?  Uh-oh.  Back to the stadium.  Well, you wanted to go back to the stadium to win it at home, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I love when the fucking fans say that.  And the news already gave you the victory at home now.  The jinx, yeah, yeah.  To win it right here at home.  Shut up.  Basically saying it didn't matter because they really just wanted to win it at home.  There were some great jinxes going on last night when stupid fucking Joe Buck said something  about one of the Phillies' pitchers hadn't walked anybody in fucking forever. 
[00:02:30]  And there he goes.  One, two, three, four.  Take your base.  It is stunning how often that happens with a stupid announcer.  It is very strange when that happens.  Well, the Philadelphia paper already congratulated the Phillies on their World Series.  Oh, have that?  Oh, good.  Let them feel the jinx then a little bit.  They had to apologize.  I guess it's in this morning's paper.  Look, congratulations, Phillies.  Back to back champs.  What is that about? 
[00:03:00]  Inquire.  Sorry for bogus Phillies ad.  They started running this ad a little early.  Someone wasn't paying attention.  That's a good jinx.  Good.  So now they have to apologize.  Good.  It's for, you know, a t-shirt to say that the Phillies won again.  The ones that they're going to be sending over to Somalia.  Somalia.  Yeah.  Ethiopia.  Look, yeah.  It was a good old-fashioned pasting of A.J. Burnett.  But it was pathetic. 
[00:03:30]  He sucked.  In two innings.  And thank God they ripped him out of there.  Because I've seen managers leave pitchers in there to see if they could turn it around.  He was just coughing up everything.  They should have left him in there and just rest everybody.  Rest them all nice.  You might be right.  Rest them all nice.  Lose the game 28-2.  28-2.  Fucking mercy rule in play.  I was yelling early on, like, get Lee out of there.  You might need him for game seven. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, really?  Rest that motherfucker.  He gave up five runs.  That's not good.  Well, yeah, yeah.  You know.  Well, the Yankees, you know, at least their bats are working.  But they're fucking pitching suck dick.  What are they doing?  They gave up, you know, eight runs.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You got to wait.  They come back.  Yankee Stadium.  Got your coffee.  Boom.  Did you watch the whole game?  Oh, yeah.  So, yeah, for the second inning, I'm like, all right, I could watch some Islanders. 
[00:04:30]  You crazy?  And then I went back.  No, I watched the whole game.  And then, again, bottom of the ninth when the Yankees are up and a couple of men on base.  You know, I guess Teixeira's up there.  He had a chance.  He had a chance.  And I was right there with the channel changer with the finger on the channel button.  And the second he struck out, I pressed the button to change the channel. 
[00:05:00]  Because I don't want to watch any celebrating.  Oh, you missed the balk.  There was a balk, and they had to redo the play.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I will not watch the Phillies fucking, with their goddamn fucking panty shields, their fucking Kotex panty shields, waving them around like that in victory.  So I changed the channel.  It's just a couple high fives.  That's it.  Because it's just a win. 
[00:05:30]  It's not the World Series.  Fuck that.  It's not the game that wins the World Series.  AJ fucked it up for us early on.  They had a struggle back.  And, Philly, you got two great players there.  Lee and fucking stupid fucking Yankee killer home run.  Jason Wirth and Chase Utley.  Jason Wirth is an animal.  What about Jason Wirth?  Wirth is a piece of shit.  Fucking Leif Garrett-looking cocksucker.  Fuck him.  Actually, I hate him because he wouldn't take pictures with us at the UFC thing. 
[00:06:00]  Fuck him.  He is a douchebag, but, man, the guy could hit the fucking ball.  Utley is...  He looks like a jerk-off.  He missed a home run by what?  Like three or four feet last night.  Yeah, fuck him.  That was a hell of a catch in the outfield.  Yes, fuck him in his ass.  And Utley tied a World Series record with his fifth homer.  Tying who?  Reggie.  Thank you.  Reggie Jackson.  He's now tied with Reggie Jackson, most home runs in a World Series.  Reggie got three in one game, though.  Reggie got three in one game.  Now, that was a big one. 
[00:06:30]  But, you know, so, wow.  They got two guys.  Do you want to comment on this instant feedback?  Spectro from Michigan.  He's a regular.  All right.  That's the only reason I'm reading it, because he's a regular.  No, no.  Go ahead.  He writes, no, I'll take a beating today.  Anne's baseball banter is cringeworthy.  Suck a dick, you fucking asshole.  That's what I hear.  That's what I hear.  Uh, you fucking did it.  Shut up.  You were fighting with everybody on Twitter last night.  Oh, was I going off?  Are you okay?  You feeling all right?  Oh, man, was I just tweeting my ass off with fucking Philly cocksuckers all night long enough already. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  And someone's saying we got to pull the audio of Ronnie B talking about you and Jimmy yesterday.  Oh, well, we were commenting on the woman behind home plate, who, by the way, was wearing the same thing she was wearing the last game.  What, red?  No, no, no.  A white turtleneck sweater thing.  That's kind of like their color, so.  No, fuck it. 
[00:07:30]  It was the same exact sweat as a pig.  You don't think she washed it?  And I didn't know.  Apparently, it's Ronnie B's sister.  Because that's what he's, uh, he got on the air and said, you know something?  It's my sister.  She got tickets back there.  But I just want to say, fuck her.  She's a loudmouth whore.  And I won't sit there and watch that bitch with her swinging earrings and her stupid fucking panty shield waving it around.  Enough!  We got whacked because our fucking pitcher stunk it up in two innings. 
[00:08:00]  And thank God he got pulled out of there.  Can they stop?  I don't like the three-man rotation.  I don't like it.  I know.  I don't like it.  It's very frightening.  Don't like it.  It's very frightening.  Now we got an old pettit arm down in there.  Oh, pettit on three days rest.  That's good.  Old pettit.  Old pettit's graham cracker arm.  Couldn't be out there.  Didn't even rest three days?  I don't know.  It's barely three days rest.  I hope so.  Oh, my God.  I told Anthony they should start Rivera.  Just start Rivera.  So it's an amazing first two outs in the first inning. 
[00:08:30]  Wow, he's really looking good.  He's looking great so far.  Against this Philly team.  Fucking one inning and he's just being pasted.  Just amazing for the first two, three batters.  Whoa, what happened to Rivera?  Ah, look.  All I have to say today is, uh-oh.  Look, if you're a Phillies fan, if you're calling the show today, just say, uh-oh.  Pedro has the potential of getting rocked, too.  So I don't want to fucking hear it.  The who's your daddy guy? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, who's your daddy?  Because the news had a lot of fun with that this morning.  Cliff Lee's very fucking tough pitcher.  It wasn't as good as his outing last time, but he was very good.  He's very hard for our fucking guys to hit.  So what are you going to do?  They kept him in a little too long, but whatever.  Whatever.  Fuck.  Just got to wait and see what happens now.  Eh?  Eh?  Giving you douche chills?  Why?  Why?  Because I want the fucking Yankees to fucking win?  Because they're fucking coming back to... 
[00:09:30]  It was fucking three to one.  What do you think?  It's going to be another big meltdown?  Ooh.  No, they won a game.  That's what happens.  They're the fucking defending champions, and they won a game at home.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Game over.  Fucking series over.  Do I hear a little panic in your voice?  No.  You hear disgust at these Philly fucking dirtbags.  The dirtbags with their stupid cheese steaks.  Clang, clang, clang with the spatula.  Clang, clang, clang.  Cutting up their steaks. 
[00:10:00]  Shut up.  You sound a little nervous.  No.  Not at all.  You all right?  I'm willing to put money on it.  You all right?  That's how fucking nervous I am.  Ronnie B's waiting for a bet.  Where's Ronnie B?  Ronnie B's waiting for a bet.  How many G's, Ronnie B?  Ronnie B's waiting for a bet.  Let's go, Ronnie B.  He's good for a bet.  How many G's you want to place on this?  How many G's?  And tell your sister to keep her ugly fucking face off the TV.  Because I'm sick of looking at her.  Well, there's no more games of Philly. 
[00:10:30]  Well, who knows?  We don't have to worry about that.  Who knows?  She'd probably show up behind and play to the stadium.  We don't have to worry about her.  That rag.  Look, it's good for you.  You get to win it at home, man.  See?  Exactly.  The news already got you your World Series.  You know what?  Have fun.  Enjoy this.  Enjoy your fucking win.  Because it's going to be, it's going to be, let's look in the dugout.  And you'll see Utley sitting there with that.  You know how the losing team sits there with that look on their face as they're watching the other team celebrate? 
[00:11:00]  That'll be fucking, Utley will be sitting there.  And they'll slowly get up and walk into the dugout.  Right before Rivera just closes them up and that's it, shuts them up, they're done.  You'll see, like, they'll be looking with that thousand-yard stare of what might have been.  That's happening at the stadium.  When?  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  Or Game 7?  Six.  Six.  I have faith in old Graham Cracker arm Pettit.  If they lose Game 6. 
[00:11:30]  All right, look.  Oh, my God.  I'm taking the day off if they lose Game 6.  Look, they can't do that again.  You can have free reign in here.  Because I don't want to deal with that shit.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, yeah?  Mike in Philly.  Mike.  Mike!  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Mike.  Hi.  Yo, Anthony, man.  Who's the only team, I believe, to lose three days to nothing in the ALCS?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:12:00]  We all remember that, don't we?  We all remember that meltdown.  What are the odds that we happen again?  Thank you.  Thank you.  A complete collapse.  Exactly.  What are the odds, right?  What are the odds?  What are the odds?  That's all right, man.  You know, what are the odds?  It's never...  It's...  30 cheesesteaks out of Junior's.  Shut up with your cheesesteak.  Shut up.  Go fucking...  Go get shot in Philadelphia, you fucking...  I got my permit to carry, man. 
[00:12:30]  Do you hear it yet?  Very good.  Yes, as a matter of fact.  It's a right to carry state.  You should come down sometime.  It's a beautiful state.  I got a fucking Pennsylvania non-resident carry, my friend.  So why are you hating on Philly, man?  They did the right thing and gave you a fucking carry permit.  Philly didn't Pennsylvania did.  I mean, Pennsylvania, that's what I mean, but you know.  I live outside of Philly, but my business is in Philly, and I can carry anywhere I want.  Yeah?  It's beautiful.  Yeah, it really is.  I got to give you that.  I'm not a little wheel gun, though, man.  I'm not into the automatics. 
[00:13:00]  You know what I mean?  You're old school.  All right.  I like that.  It's all right.  It gets the job done.  All right.  Hey, good luck to you there.  Good luck.  We'll be all right, man.  Right.  I hope for a game seven.  I'm a big baseball fan, and, you know, let the better team come out.  Hey, don't you want a game seven, Ant, just to make it fun?  No.  Make it fun for everybody?  Nope.  Same thing as game six.  They're at the stadium.  They win.  They win the World Series.  Why?  You don't have confidence in your team in a game seven? 
[00:13:30]  Who's going to fucking pitch?  Girardi?  Who's fucking pitching game seven?  Old man Pettit.  There's nobody left.  Old man Pettit on the mound.  That's not allowed.  They're going to have to fucking...  Have fun with old man Pettit on the mound.  Have to get goose gossage.  They are.  Why?  We could pack up some cheesesteaks and send them to Somalia with your world championship  hat.  Oh, shit.  Shut your yap.  Shut your yap.  Man, are you guaranteeing a Yankee World Series victory?  I'm not...  Start jambling. 
[00:14:00]  Shut up.  No, I'm not guaranteeing anything.  Why don't...  I'm just saying...  Why aren't you one of those guys that guarantee stuff?  What I foresee and what I picture...  No guarantees.  No?  This is fucking...  You know...  This is World Series baseball.  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt in Connecticut.  Matt.  Hey, yo.  Hey, Ant.  What's up, Matt?  Just remember, the Phillies are the only team with 10,000 losses.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  That's a good one.  That's a nice stat.  We weren't alive for most of those losses.  Yeah, I know.  You know, come on. 
[00:14:30]  Come on.  That's silly.  Well, they showed a nice black and white clip of fucking Joe DiMaggio hitting a home  run, and then Yogi Berra getting up and hitting a home run, and Tatega sweeping the Phillies  in four games, and then everybody on Twitter, of course, said, oh, I bet Anthony was at  that game.  There's definitely a possibility.  A bunch of fucking stuff.  Now that we know you're a vampire, it's very possible.  A bunch of smartasses.  Did you at least see the sunlight yesterday, did you?  Only on the way home? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, on the way home.  That was about it.  And then slept.  Yeah, crapped out for a little while.  Woke up, watched the game.  That was it.  By the way, there was football last night, I guess.  Oh, yeah?  Saints are still undefeated, if anyone cares.  No one really...  You see, you know what it is.  These two teams are...  A lot of attention.  Their ratings are up for this series.  It's not one of those things like, oh, football, fucking...  I'm not going to watch it.  A lot of people are watching this one.  No, you've got to watch World Series over a Monday Night Game, right?  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Unless you're a Saints fan, I'm sure.  And my Islanders looking good.  All right.  What else is going on?  It's Election Day.  Yes.  It's Election Day.  And apparently, a big gubernatorial race in Jersey, which is having a monkey wrench thrown  into it with an independent candidate that's taken away Republican votes, I assume.  Corzine's been in there.  Obama's campaigning like crazy for Corzine.  Yeah.  They're asshole buddies hanging out.  And Corzine is a nothing but tax-deliving shit out of everybody and lose so many jobs 
[00:16:00]  in Jersey.  The guy's a piece of shit.  So I recommend you go out there and pull the lever for the Republican there, Christie.  Well, Corzine's not going to lose, though.  He's got two presidents fucking campaigning.  It's not what the stats say.  They're saying...  Is it close?  It's more than close.  They're saying Christie's got a lead.  Ooh.  Christie's got the lead.  Even with Obama support and... 
[00:16:30]  Even with Obama support.  And I think Clinton's supporting Corzine, too, right?  They're saying a lot of people are getting a bit discouraged with the Democrats.  And, yeah.  There's a naked cowboy singing about your Yankees, I'm sure.  Is that what he's doing?  I'm sure he is.  Fucking...  There you go.  The naked cowboy.  He is.  Oh, she's disgusted.  But Philly fans do crazy stuff.  You're looking at a guy in his underpants singing a song from the New York Yankees.  That's a Times Square shill.  That guy has nothing to do with the fucking Yankees.  Oh, yeah?  Nothing. 
[00:17:00]  I hear he's singing the national anthem for game six.  I wouldn't think so.  I don't think so.  And Bloomberg basically saying, you know, he's already got the victory.  It's just a matter of by how much.  He has decided to change the rules and has decided he's going to be the mayor of New York  City until he dies, I guess.  He's a multi-billionaire and has spent more money on his election than any mayor in the  United States history. 
[00:17:30]  He has spent more money campaigning than any mayor in the history of this country.  He pretty much bought it.  So what does this mean?  He gets a third term, a fourth term?  Where does this end?  Let's see what happens.  I don't know.  Because now term limits are done.  Is term limits three years or is it now like a pulp?  You're in there until you're fucking done.  You mean three terms?  I think it's three terms.  No, it was never three terms.  It was two terms.  But it's still two terms.  No, he just said it's three terms.  But you can't just say.  I don't know.  He just said and that's it? 
[00:18:00]  He said.  He said.  For real, how does that work?  You can't just say I want to continue being the mayor.  There's some bullshit kind of vote.  He said that.  And then.  Yeah, they went to.  He went to, you know, whoever's in charge of that shit, which, by the way, it wasn't  the people.  It wasn't the people voting on whether they want term limits.  It was some fucking board who I'm sure.  Oh, I'm sure he made a few promises, too.  Mm hmm.  It's just, you know, politics as usual.  And, yeah, he's got that wrapped up.  So we're going to have Bloomberg up our ass and in our pockets for, you know, 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Jimmy James.  Four more years.  Jimmy James.  Morning, bo-bo-bo-boy.  How are you, Jimmy James?  Hey, just continuing our quote-unquote sports break.  I wanted to call and see if Jimmy was nursing a nasty thumb blister from flipping between  the World Series and Ozzy on Raw last night.  I didn't watch Raw and I was doing a set last night, so I didn't.  I was 62 in the World Series because I was taping Red Eye. 
[00:19:00]  So they were losing badly while I was taping.  And then I went down to the comedy cellar for a little while.  I stopped in and I just, by the time I got home, it was like still 62 and I just, I  didn't watch anymore.  You, yeah, you missed a good Raw.  It was quite entertaining.  Ozzy was in his, uh, was in his glory.  Where'd they tape it?  Uh, it was in Worcester, I believe.  Oh, okay.  Worcester, Massachusetts.  Wow.  At one point they had Hornswoggle, the midget, come out dressed as Jack Osborne. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, okay.  Apparently it's, it sounds weird when it was, okay.  It was actually quite entertaining.  Ozzy had a, you could tell he was enjoying himself.  All right.  Well, where's Sam?  Sam fucking was.  Yeah, where's Sam?  Where's Sam?  Did Sharon and Ozzy do a good job on Raw or not?  Dude, come on.  Sharon's coming in here today, by the way.  Let's, let's assume, no.  I would not make that assumption.  I'm going to assume, no.  No.  I would make just the opposite assumption.  Would you?  I certainly would. 
[00:20:00]  I would say it was probably very douche chillish.  Sam, how bad was it?  Douche chillery.  How bad was it?  Well, um, they did the big intro.  They played, uh, Crazy Train.  And then, uh, and he, he intro'd some of the matches.  They did a thing where Ozzy and Sharon didn't really know what was going on, so  Triple H and Shawn Michaels were whispering into their ears what matches Triple H and Shawn 
[00:20:30]  Michaels wanted.  Then, uh...  Sam, that's way too inside.  Keep it very basic.  It's like, what?  Yeah, keep it very basic.  I could care less about that stuff.  Just, did they look like complete and total assholes?  They did a skit.  A skit?  Yeah.  What kind of skit did Sharon and Ozzy do?  Well, you know how Sharon's a judge on America's Got Talent?  Yes, a show I watch.  Sharon and Ozzy were the judges of Raw Has Got Talent. 
[00:21:00]  Raw Has Got Talent.  Raw Has Got Talent.  Raw Has Got Talent.  Yeah.  I like it.  Turns out they don't.  Turns out they don't.  All right.  Well, let's, uh, let's listen to the first clip here.  Ozzy welcomes the crowd to Raw.  Monday Night Raw is live tonight in Worcester.  Hey!  And we're in for a wild ride.  Oh, what the crazy train!  Michael! 
[00:21:30]  It's Ozzy Hussford!  It's my sheriff!  Oh, no.  Welcome to Monday Night Raw!  All aboard!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  All aboard indeed!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! 
[00:22:00]  That was the cartoon laugh.  The fucking dog.  What was his name?  Muttley.  Muttley.  Thank you, Anthony.  Muttley.  We have Muttley on the phone.  Oh, no.  Do you like that, Jimmy James?  A lot of people are asking, Jim Norton here, okay, do you consider this a sellout?  No.  Hosting a...  No.  All right.  Why would it be?  A lot of people are asking.  That's all.  I didn't imply.  No, it would be a sellout if Ozzy had railed against Raw for years or wrestling, saying 
[00:22:30]  it was shit, and then they offered him money, and then he did it.  But no, what's wrong with Posting?  They don't take themselves that seriously.  What's wrong with it?  Okay.  He was pushing his new book.  Yeah.  He's got a book coming out in January.  Right.  No, I know.  I started reading it.  Did they lip sync his laugh?  No, that was real.  I don't think the laugh...  Wow.  I don't think that doesn't sound like that was live at all, actually.  All right, well, Ozzy Sharon and the great Khali.  Khali.  Khali.  Khali.  He was the third judge.  The third judge, Raw's got talent. 
[00:23:00]  Guerrero and Jillian performed Close My Eyes Forever.  What?  Sharon Ozzy, I am such a huge fan.  She is.  She's a fan.  When I heard Chopo was going to be singing an Ozzy song, I insisted that we do a duet.  The one with Ozzy and Lita Ford.  She did.  She did.  Close My Eyes Forever.  So are you guys ready to rock?  Are you ready to rock?  And we're going to kill him, Lita. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  All right.  Baby, I guess I'm scared inside and I don't really understand.  Is this love that's on my mind?  Or is it fair to say?  Heaven is in the pop of my hands and it's waiting there for you. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, my God.  What am I supposed to do in a childhood tragedy?  What, Jerry?  Go on.  If I close my ears.  What do you know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to retitle that song and call it Close My Ears Forever.  Oh, you people do not know talent.  Oh, I get it.  What are they doing, Sam?  Well, see, Jillian...  This show sucks. 
[00:24:30]  No, Jillian's gimmick is that she's a pop singer, but she can't sing well.  Uh-huh.  So, in this case, it was a perfect fit that she would come out and be the one to sing.  Perfect fit.  Because she thinks she can sing well, but then Sharon gave the old no-go on that one, the old buzz-a-rooney.  The old buzz-a-rooney.  Yeah.  Jimmy James, what did you think of that?  Um, I pretty much, uh, the silence said it all. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  We have one more clip, Ant.  Oh, great.  That's it.  We can't do too many more of these.  You should look at the video while you're...  That's all right.  I don't need to see it.  You've got to see...  No, it's okay.  Sharon, you have always been jealous, Alita Ford.  You're jealous.  And Ozzy, I'm not even a fan of yours.  She's not a fan.  Hey, you little cow.  I just said that.  Get out of my hands.  It's not for doing it. 
[00:25:30]  Come on.  But you know what?  Right now...  Come on, Tommy.  I'm going to sing this song.  I'm a real rock icon.  That's right, baby.  Sing it.  Miss Britney Spears.  All the way.  Yeah, sing it.  Sing it.  I think I did it again.  No, no.  I made you believe we're more than just friends.  What am I listening to?  Oh, baby.  It might seem like it's fresh.  What am I listening to? 
[00:26:00]  You were just saying it was that bad.  No, no, no.  You need to control your life, Ozzy.  You need to control your life.  Hey, you can try and do it.  I can't.  Sharon slapped Jillian in the face.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, well, it ends with horn-swoggled...  No, you can just leave it with it ends.  And I was happy.  You should know.  It ends with horn-swoggled the leprechaun coming out dressed as Jack Osborne. 
[00:26:30]  Well, that's crazy.  Why is there a whole table and...  I told you, it's a skit.  It's a skit.  They're redoing America's Got Talent.  America's Got Talent, right.  Yes.  They'll just sit, so...  What?  Was this spontaneous?  Couldn't be.  There was a desk there.  Exactly.  No.  Big set, everything.  This was a planned, uh...  Skit.  Can I ask, uh, what was Ozzy and or Sharon plugging that they would bring themselves to 
[00:27:00]  this level?  Was it the show?  The TV show?  Ozzy's book.  Oh, oh, okay.  I knew there's...  There's always something when somebody is a guest on, uh, on WWE.  Well, they've got to have something to promote.  Why can't they just show up for the fun of it?  Maybe they will in the future.  Maybe it's just coincidence.  They'll never be back.  You know what?  Why would they ever come back?  You have to trade your dignity for something.  You can't just give your dignity away.  You've got to trade...  Why promote the book two months out, though?  It's so...  It's weird.  If it's not coming out until January. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right, Jimmy James, thanks for the heads up on that.  Thank you, boys.  All right, brother.  Let's go to Frank in Pennsylvania.  Frank!  Yeah, first, Jimmy, if you're not embarrassed to be a fan of this guy after that, I don't  know what to tell you about it.  What do you mean?  Wrestling?  Uh, no, not wrestling.  Ozzy Osbourne and the shillery and sellout and it's just doing...  Oh, stop it, dude.  Don't be a douchebag.  Whatever.  Why...  No, no, no.  Why...  I don't just...  I'm not even defending Ozzy.  I'm saying, why is that a sellout for a guy to do something on a platform like that 
[00:28:00]  that's silly?  Like, what's the problem?  The problem is that it's embarrassing.  Just like that bogus variety show they tried to do that bombed.  It's embarrassing, Jimmy.  Look where he came from and look where he is now.  Yes, the Osbournes changed television.  You dope.  It's a reality show that changed fucking television.  Okay, so they had a hit with the reality show.  Why don't you just call it a day and stop...  No, no, no.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  We're going to go down the road.  You want to go down?  You want to say that they're sellouts for doing something because they had a variety 
[00:28:30]  show that didn't do well?  Meanwhile, they changed television with the reality show.  Now, you're the same kind of idiot that would have called up and said, oh, they're sellouts.  They're doing a reality show.  Why would Aussies show all that?  But you know you can't say that or you'll look really stupid.  So you have to give them that.  I wouldn't say that because I agree with you that, yeah, revolutionized TV and reality  TV, that's fine.  Okay, so they did...  It's not for, Jimmy.  So I agree with you in that respect.  But once you're done and you have that hit, call it a day. 
[00:29:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait.  She's hosting...  Well, hold on.  No, no.  She's hosting...  Sharon's also doing America's Got Talent.  That's also something you would say is a sellout move for the family.  But it's a massive hit and you can't say that.  So what you do is you pick Monday Night Raw, which is a silly one-off that they do, and  one variety show that didn't work.  And all of a sudden they're sellouts?  You fucking got nothing.  What I'm saying is stop while you got what you got.  Well, but you would have said that before they did the reality show because you was 
[00:29:30]  already Ozzy Osbourne.  It wouldn't have needed to be said.  You would have said that before the reality show.  Why do a reality show?  You're already Ozzy.  You sell it out.  It's a huge genre, Jimmy.  Of course they're going to do it.  A lot of people...  Oh, oh!  Wait a minute.  It's a huge genre, but Raw is not?  Raw is not a huge place to promote a book?  So I guess what's he supposed to do when he's got a book coming out?  Not promote it?  Because fucking pseudo-rebels like you don't think it's cool enough?  Shut up.  He's not going to fucking embarrassing wrestling show and act like a fucking jerk-off. 
[00:30:00]  How did he act like a jerk-off?  He actually was pretty funny.  What did he do that was so jerked off?  He did a silly skit.  What?  Should he yell booze?  Booze!  Is that what your idea of a rocker is, you fucking 1985 cornball?  He should have yelled booze!  Shut up, stupid.  You're fucking rock image.  They're just people.  They're goofballs like everybody else.  Shut it.  You're pulling shit out of your ass.  No, I'm not.  I've just destroyed you because you're a fucking cornball yelling sellout.  You're the type of guy that would yell, homework sucks! 
[00:30:30]  Shut up.  You done barking?  No, I'm not done barking.  I'll continue to bark.  Let someone else get a word in edgewise.  Make a fucking point, stupid.  Everything you've said, I'm shredded.  You haven't shredded a damn thing.  The guy was an embarrassment on this show.  And I said what was embarrassing.  He actually had some funny lines.  And you went into, he was on Raw.  He was on Raw.  Shut up.  No, that itself was embarrassing, angry dog. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, it wasn't embarrassing or it was?  Well, it's the same old, dumb fucking old guy bid where he doesn't realize what's going on.  Yeah, I get it.  You fucking don't know.  And you're hard to understand.  I get it, Arrest.  I didn't catch any of that from this.  I did.  But I didn't catch any of that from what we just heard.  Everything he said was understood.  I didn't catch any of that.  By your love of this man, that no matter what he touches, it's beautiful to you.  And none of it's stupid. 
[00:31:30]  No, what I don't do is I don't judge something called, that's not true.  The reality show didn't work.  The variety show.  My problem is, like the Samsung commercial he does, people are like, that's a sellout.  Why?  It's like, it's guys like you who are not entertainers.  You're fucking, you're fucking sideline watchers.  And then you start calling what's a sellout.  Go ahead.  So is your whole audience, Jim.  What does that even mean?  What I'm saying is, you're sitting there judging what a sellout is, stupid.  That's my point.  You're not in a position to judge what a sellout is because you're not in the position to know what it is. 
[00:32:00]  Because you don't do it.  You're not in the show, Jim.  What's that?  I'm the audience.  So I'm the one who's the judge.  No, you're not, you dumb motherfucker.  Because a person sells out themselves and their own ideals and morals, not according to what you think is a sellout, you blithering idiot.  Asshole.  I'm not saying he's a sellout.  Yes, you are.  You're saying that they, of course you said that.  Now you're fucking backtracking.  You're a liar.  Stupid.  I'm not saying he's a sellout.  You just said that they were selling out.  You're lying. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, dummy, let me finish the sentence.  Let you finish?  Why?  So you can lie again?  You said they were selling out.  Apologize for saying they were selling out.  I'm not going to apologize to you.  Then I'm not going to let you get a fucking word in because you're a liar.  Let me get a word.  I'll fucking scream over.  Yeah, I'd scream over like a fuck.  That's what a woman does.  You have no point, woman.  Fucking flash your tits and say you're hot flashing, you fucking woman.  Shut up.  You're not going to out yell me because I have a fucking mic in front of me, stupid.  Yell into your shitty fucking sprint cell phone until you get throat cancer like Babe Ruth. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, I know.  Another throat cancer joke.  Shut your fucking face.  You said they were selling out.  I fucking kicked your argument in the balls.  And now you're going, I didn't say they were selling out.  Yes, you did.  Done?  No, girl.  I'm not done.  What happened?  What happened?  Fucking woman.  Your fucking shouting strategy didn't work.  I'm like a bitch.  I'm shouting.  You're the one.  Oh, now you're stealing my lines?  Now you're calling me a girl because I called you a girl?  So you're a liar and a fucking concept thief? 
[00:33:30]  Shut up.  Fucking open your veins in the tub, fucking Mr. 1985.  I know what integrity is.  Shut the fuck up.  What is Mr. 1985?  Of course you don't get it because you're dumb, too.  You're a fucking liar.  You're a woman and you're stupid.  Perfect.  You're like every broad.  What's that?  I didn't hear you.  I didn't hear you because you talked while I was talking.  Rude.  Dude, you also don't have phone skills.  All right.  So he's not a sellout because he's selling a product, tell me.  He's a sellout because he's making an asshole out of himself. 
[00:34:00]  But he didn't make an asshole out of himself, dude.  This is why I heard the lines.  And if he made an ass out of himself, I don't think Ozzy is beyond admitting that he's made  an ass out of himself.  The man pissed on the Alamo.  I don't think Ozzy is above going, ah, he acted like an ass last night.  So controversial.  But the audio, it's just something he did when he was drunk, dude.  Just something he did when he was drunk.  The point is, he'd be the first one to go, yeah, that was a real asshole thing to do.  But let me finish, dude.  The audio I heard from that little bit we played, him and his wife did a silly sketch 
[00:34:30]  on a silly show.  Who gives a shit?  Because you...  That to me is not a sellout for any musician to do it.  For a book?  You're going to go make a jerk of yourself for a fucking book?  Again, once again, a perfect sideline fucking attitude.  Dude, you do, of course you do, you fucking promote a book, stupid.  Of course you do.  You know what?  You know how many different ways there are to promote a book?  I'm not a...  Yes, and this is one of them.  How many of them give you a TV audience like this, you dildo? 
[00:35:00]  Not many.  You're obviously not a publicist, you fucking boob.  Dude, you could have taken out an ad in the store and ledger.  Shut your fucking mouth.  Jerk off.  Don't act like you know how to promote a book and you're fucking trying to explain it to  me like I've written ten of them.  I've written two and I'm telling you.  So don't...  Exactly.  Thank you.  Admit you haven't written ten and that you're on the sidelines and you don't know what you're  talking about.  Thank you.  I'm on the sidelines, asshole.  I'm the audience.  Yes, but then don't act like you know how to sell a book because you're not an author.  You're not a book salesman. 
[00:35:30]  You're a jerk off who thinks he knows what integrity is and you're dumped.  You're yelling into a cell phone for somebody who's being paid to yell into their microphone.  I'm doing this for money.  You're doing this for free because you're an ass.  Correct.  You go on a wrestling show and promote your stupid book.  In a second I would go on a wrestling show.  Did you?  Did you?  Why wouldn't I?  I'm not...  Dude, I'm not fucking big enough to have on Raw.  I'm not famous enough to have on Raw.  If they would have had me on Raw, I would have gone on in a second, but unfortunately I'm  not famous enough to do that. 
[00:36:00]  And you would have done the same thing.  He's acting like a fucking dummy, made him fucking look like a jerk.  You would have done the same things for your book.  Would I have acted fucking silly and taken part of a silly sketch to promote?  Of course I would have.  There's a difference between doing something that goes completely against everything you...  Like Ozzy, for this of course you don't understand it, when he was touring with Motley  Crew, came on stage in a dress and lifted his fucking dress over his head.  This is not a guy who takes himself that seriously and he never has been.  And as a fan of that, I understand that. 
[00:36:30]  If he did certain things, like if he sold out his ideals, then I'd have a major problem  with him.  Someone's saying this is actually Stephen King calling in right now.  That's so awesome.  The term sellout, it's like you better be ready to fucking defend that.  Because Pearl Jam, people would say they sold out because what did they do?  Target commercial.  Yeah, I mean this is a band that like, hey man, we don't go with the corporations.  And then they go and they do a fucking Target only release.  Frank, thank you for your phone call.  We're going to move on.  All right, see ya.  Let's say hi to Cody in Indiana.  Cody, what's up? 
[00:37:00]  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Cody.  Hi.  I don't think that it was necessarily selling out because you're right, he didn't compromise  any of the things that he stands for.  Right.  I just think that what they had done, they couldn't have foreseen was going to be that corny.  It was a good idea for them to do, but in hindsight just ended up being so corny that  it ended up being a good publicity, but ended up being a bad business decision as far as  like image-wise.  But it wasn't necessarily Ozzy or Sharon that was stupid. 
[00:37:30]  It was the two fucking wrestling idiots that were stupid.  Well, if it's corny, I'll accept that.  But again, to me, wrestling, I'm not a wrestling fan.  To me, the whole genre of wrestling is corny.  I mean, you know what I mean?  Like, I don't enjoy any of it.  So it's like, to me, anything to do with wrestling would be, like, you know what I'm  saying?  It's like you have to look at where they are, too.  It's not like they were sitting in front of Obama at the White House acting like assholes.  They were on wrestling.  Which they were.  The publicity and the exposure that they got, I mean, ultimately the end justifies the 
[00:38:00]  means in this.  Would it be something that if I was, you know, if I was in their position, I would do?  It'd be hard to say because I don't know if it's really worth it to me to kind of be  associated with you fucking off-seeing idiots, but, you know.  But again, if you don't like wrestling and you don't want to be associated with wrestling,  that's one thing.  But them doing something silly like that, and like she's kind of, in a way, poking fun  at the fucking show she does or parodying the show she does, like, to me, that's just  so silly for people to go, if you thought it was corny, all right, that's just a judgment  call.  I can't make sense.  All right, Cody, let's go to Jimmy in Jersey. 
[00:38:30]  Jimmy!  Yes.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, hello.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I think you're trying to force your definition of selling out on everyone.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Ozzy's selling out, but you, I mean, Sharon had  a fucking TV show.  I mean, the cell phone commercials.  I mean, that's not what Ozzy, whether it's against his ideals or not, it doesn't seem to  be what he was always all about.  I mean, the dude's a rock star.  Why is that?  Like, meaning, this is why I'm saying I'm trying to take people's, according to my definition 
[00:39:00]  of what selling out is.  Well, I think a lot of people...  How is that not what he was?  I'm sorry, go ahead.  All right, maybe not that, I think, but you're still trying to put your idea of what selling  out is on others.  Obviously, some people think that him doing a cell phone commercial is selling out.  I mean, that's their definition of it.  You can't deny that he has done that.  And whether it be him or not, obviously, it's Sharon.  I mean, he's still doing that.  It's kind of cheesy.  It's kind of cheesy.  But people who said that, like, the Osbournes itself was selling out, we heard that argument 
[00:39:30]  back in 2001.  And then when it became what it was, and people saw the honesty of it, and they have hindsight  now with what other celebrities have tried to do, and how, wow, Ozzy and Sharon actually  did a really honest reality show where there were no take twos.  There was no re-saying something.  This was just a guy being himself and being fucking funny.  You can't say it's selling out.  So now they have to...  Oh, the phones are now...  It's like, you can't win.  That's what annoys me.  That wasn't selling out.  That was one of the fucking best shows ever. 
[00:40:00]  I loved it.  And so did everybody else.  However, after that, they tried to build on that success by continuing...  Ozzy's doing cell phone commercials.  So he's done a cell phone campaign since then.  She's done America's Got Talent, which is one of the biggest shows on television.  And they did a variety show, which apparently wasn't good.  I didn't see it.  But so where's this big steamroller down Sellout Hill happening?  He's done a cell phone campaign.  So what?  What about Sharon's talk show? 
[00:40:30]  Didn't work.  But I mean, how...  Exactly.  I mean, they just continued...  They took the success of something that...  Yes, I agree.  They completely changed reality TV by that show.  They did.  But then they took that and said, you know what?  We made millions of dollars doing this.  Let's try to cash in on something else.  Let's throw Sharon on a talk show.  Let's put Ozzy in a fucking infomercial for ShamWow.  I mean, I don't know.  But dude, hold on.  The thing is this.  You have to understand.  They come and offer you this stuff.  You don't know the stuff they've turned down. 
[00:41:00]  It's almost like you don't think that they just were standing there with their fucking  hats in their hand going, talk show?  Okay, we'll do it.  It's like, how do you know how many fucking things they came to these people with?  You think that Ozzy and Sharon don't get offered other stuff?  They say no.  They probably say no to 90% of the things they get offered.  And the fact that she accepted a talk show, well, anybody would accept a talk show after  coming off the Osbournes.  She fucking, she did her cancer battle on fucking television before reality people were really  doing that.  All right.  I've been listening to you for 10 years.  I love you. 
[00:41:30]  I just think that if this was somebody else, you'd be singing a different tune.  I honestly wouldn't do it if they were doing something honest and that was not selling  out their ideals.  I really wouldn't.  I don't attack people for making money, man.  I really don't.  I don't think it's a sellout to make money or be more successful.  All right, let's go to Jeff.  Or to get yourself out there.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, what's happening?  Hi, Jeff.  How's it going, boys?  Hello.  I just, I got to tell you, man, it's great.  I just got home from England, hopped in the truck, clicked on the radio, and there's  Jimmy going ballistic on some guy. 
[00:42:00]  But I didn't want to go ballistic on the guy.  I really didn't.  I just, that drive, because as a comedian, I got called a sellout one time because I  did MTV pilots.  Like, you get that, Opie and Anthony's show, you're going to get it when you do something  different than according to what fans think you should be doing.  And that's not, to me, a sellout as a guy.  Like, Linda Lovelace, to me, sold out porn because she does something and then comes out  and goes, oh, that was terrible.  It's a horrible, you know what I mean?  That, to me, on that, is a sellout in what you're doing.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  And, I mean, you know, it's the whole point of entertainment. 
[00:42:30]  And like you just said, Jimmy, you know, they're probably offered, you know, 99% of the stuff  that they're offered, they're probably turning down, and who wouldn't jump at the opportunity?  They were hot after their show, so they, you know, they tried to go on further with it.  And a lot of Ozzy's demo is wrestling.  If you're selling your book, you have to kind of go where your demographic is.  And don't tell me that those maniacs, wrestling fans, and I'm not even a wrestler, they're  Ozzy fans.  I mean, that's the fucking demo he's going for.  It's the young, white male demo.  Those are the guys who are going to buy his books.  And what should he go on?  Fucking P. Diddy show if he has one?  Fuck, it doesn't make sense. 
[00:43:00]  All right, let's continue.  Just going down the line here, by the way.  Kenny in Jersey, what do you got?  Kenny's the comedian around here.  Hey, it's actually Tony.  I'm sorry.  I have a little bit of a hangover.  All right, Tony.  But anyway, R.P., how are you?  Jimmy?  Hey, what's up?  What's going on?  You know, I think it's not about selling out to what the other fan is saying.  It's more about going commercial.  And by meaning, you know, starting a hot product or your own product and trying to, like, get  more money from your fans. 
[00:43:30]  It's selling out.  I don't necessarily think Ozzy's selling out in the fact that he's doing these skits or promoting  a book.  Maybe by doing the commercials, he's selling out a bit because, you know, now he's a product  whore.  But that's, but what is he, a product whore is that he sells, he did a campaign for Samsung  phones.  Like, I'm not sure how that makes the guy a product whore when he became a spokesperson.  They must have liked the campaign.  They probably thought the campaign was funny or it was cool to do. 
[00:44:00]  He's a heavy metal guy who's like a legend in metal.  A lot of people credit him with being one of the fucking founders of heavy metal and  he's poking fun at himself.  He doesn't need the money.  So it's obviously a campaign they agreed with and thought it was kind of funny.  So, like, where's the product whore part come in?  Well, because they made him look like a tool.  I mean, how does that make him look like a...  I got...  It was one thing if the guy would come out and be all about, hey, it's like, you know,  like, I hear this is the coolest thing, Eric.  But they made him look like he's retarded now because he did so many drugs for years and 
[00:44:30]  he can't even talk right.  And I think, you know, it just made him look bad.  They're goofing on something.  They're goofing on a perception.  Like, I remember when the Osbournes was being pitched or done.  They were having a press conference.  And some reporter said, like, some remark he made about Ozzy not being intelligible or  understandable.  And Sharon snapped at him.  She's like, that's my husband, you asshole.  Like, back a few years ago, she was really pissed off.  And I guess as it becomes this common thing and everybody knows, like, yeah, fucking Ozzy  is hard to understand sometimes.  It's like it becomes easier to fucking poke fun at. 
[00:45:00]  You understand?  I don't think that's making a tool out of yourself.  And believe me, I don't think that Ozzy is above all.  He's done songs I didn't like.  There's been albums I liked a lot less than other albums.  I don't think he's above criticism.  I just, the criticism people are giving, I don't get.  And nobody said either.  I think what a lot of people have, and what I mean, let's say this morning, it just seems  like sometimes you defend him a little more.  Like, you're very quick to judge other people.  But it's almost like no matter what Ozzy does, he can't do any wrong. 
[00:45:30]  Well, that's what's called being a fan of somebody.  But within reason.  It doesn't mean, I don't think necessarily the variety show.  You know, but if the variety show would have been a hit.  Let's just say that it was a hit and a rating smash and they did a whole season of them,  people would be going, well, you know what?  It worked.  But because it didn't work, all of a sudden it was a sellout move.  People tend to judge him.  Sorry, Jimmy.  I don't disagree.  That's not a variety show.  I don't disagree with you on that because, you know, even if an artist or performer are  trying something new, I give you credit for that.  That's not selling out. 
[00:46:00]  I'm really referring to his commercialism of, you know, doing advertisements and trying  to sell different products and things like that.  Well, that's what I feel you're selling out.  Okay.  A lot of people don't like it being more commercial.  All right.  Hey, look, if you feel that way, you feel that way.  But I don't think, look, if he was on TV, like the guy said, doing a ShamWow commercial,  I mean, to me, there is a line of horrible, but that's not what's happening.  And being a Samsung spokesman for probably fucking lots of dough, you'd be a dummy to turn  that down. 
[00:46:30]  You're just selling a cell phone.  Well, but see, that's another question for you.  Does he need the money?  Like, if he doesn't need the money, why go out and become a spokesperson for Samsung  for lots of dough?  Because you have fucking, you have kids and generations of kids coming after you.  And why not?  Like, why doesn't Bill Gates step down when he, and he's got more money than any human  being will ever need?  I mean, it's like, if it's, if it's something that you, you don't mind doing or that your  product, you kind of are comfortable doing the campaign with, why would you turn down  millions of dollars?  It doesn't make sense.  He said in interviews, I like making dough. 
[00:47:00]  He'd be a dummy not to.  Ozzy should have been, if the way he fucking abused himself, if life was fair, he would  have died in the mid seventies, man.  He fucking skated through.  It's like he's alive.  Why shouldn't he just go out and get whatever he can with him?  You know what I mean?  I don't get why anybody would criticize that.  I'm, again, not criticizing him.  I'm just saying that, you know, from an outsider looking in, sometimes it looks like these people  who have money or don't really need it.  And I don't know his financial situation, but it just seems sometimes like, why do you  do things like that? 
[00:47:30]  You know, again, from a commercial standpoint, you know, some people, they, they, they do  commercials for products that they really believe in.  I don't know about Samsung phone or whatever, whatever that was, it's something you really  believe in, you know, it's cell phone.  Well, it's a phone.  Like, you know, look, I'm a recovering alcoholic, right?  I do a commercial for beer.  Eh, be a lot of money, but I would.  Right.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you.  Just going down the phones, cause we can't get to everybody.  If Ozzy went on SNL, would people still call him a sellout? 
[00:48:00]  Mike in Ohio, not a bad decision to go on a hugely popular weekly show to push a product.  Ozzy isn't a sellout.  This is from Rick in Maine, just trying to promote himself.  Terry in Illinois.  What was Ozzy promoting in the seventies when he was extremely popular?  Eddie in Ohio.  What part of marketing don't the other callers understand?  Dustin in Texas.  If half of these people got Ozzy's money to promote a cell phone, they'd go on TV and  call their mother a whore.  And I'd be, I'd be willing to bet that there, again, we don't see the product offers have 
[00:48:30]  turned down.  Cause I guarantee you there's been millions of dollars in no's to products that they didn't  want to be a part of or campaigns that they didn't like.  Let's go to Chris in Nashville.  Chris.  Hey guys.  Hey.  I think Ozzy has kind of, he's not really sold himself.  He's just so watered down.  Like, especially with the World of Warcraft, the commercials like that, then the MasterCard  or pizza commercial I saw.  I like Ozzy, but it's just a little watered down now.  Well, maybe he's got, people would accuse him of overexposure.  But I like it for him because I was a fan, uh, in the fucking eighties and he was always 
[00:49:00]  popular, but he certainly wasn't quote unquote as mainstream as he is now.  But I like the fact that he's fucking getting recognition everywhere.  It's like, I'm happy for him.  I really am.  It's like, good.  Cause I got sick and tired of seeing other bands everywhere.  Like I like to turn on the TV and fucking see Ozzy, the guy I like, as opposed to other  fucking guys who I hated.  So yeah, if he's in a fucking video game, cause people like him, but I'm being a video game.  Yeah.  I appreciate it, guys.  Sure.  Look, if the guy was doing tampon commercials, I'd understand people fucking...  Jeez, the phones won't let up. 
[00:49:30]  Greg in New Hampshire.  Greg.  Greg.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Jim, you're two biggest favorite stars, Gene Simmons and fucking Ozzy.  Why do you defend these guys from the seventies who are non-relevant today and are just fucking  money-grubbing to the end of their lives?  You're fucking retarded, Jim.  But do you really think that Ozzy is not relevant today, dude?  Like, is that...  Yes, I think Ozzy has no relevance today, Jim.  Fucking give me a break.  Hold on now.  You don't think that the Oz...  But this is just a silly call.  Ozzy, are you fucking kidding me with Ozzy?  You're fucking retarded. 
[00:50:00]  But to say that he's not relevant, you just don't know what you're talking about.  You know who's not really relevant today?  If you wanted to say a guy like Robert Plant isn't that relevant today, cause he's still  doing pretty good music, but nobody really talks about Robert Plant in the mainstream.  Ozzy, they do.  Well, he won Grammys for his latest project.  Well, that's mainstream.  That's not being offered endorsement.  Meaning he's not somebody that you just fucking...  Everyone's rapping about.  Maybe that's a bad example, but there's plenty of people you could say aren't.  The album he made with Alison Krauss or whatever her name was, it was huge with a lot of fucking 
[00:50:30]  Grammys.  So I'm wrong about that, but you know what I'm saying.  It's like...  All right, whatever.  You know what I mean.  There's plenty of people that aren't.  But to say Ozzy isn't relevant is just silly because the guy...  They changed television.  And you can't deny that.  It's like...  But people...  Remember what we were doing at fucking Eddie W?  People were calling up.  It's a fucking sellout.  What's he doing?  Walking around without his shirt.  Now he doesn't know how to use the remote.  He's in there.  And then all of a sudden people saw, oh wow, it's beautiful that a guy is not trying  to be a rock star at home.  The guy's got glasses on and he goes on stage and does what he does and just goes home 
[00:51:00]  and his fucking wife bitches at him like every other person.  Yeah, well, I guess...  Wow.  Are we done?  I guess you're going to have to...  The phone's still lit.  Agree to disagree.  Oh, fuck it.  I don't care how many of these stupid callers say that.  Because I've been called a sellout for something when I did that MTV pilot.  So it's...  You know, when people start saying, what's the show out?  It's like, you...  Fuck you.  Fuck up.  Fuck yourself.  Do you wish Ozzy was doing other things?  Like what?  I don't know.  I'm not sure what you...  You're the fan. 
[00:51:30]  Like, you want to see him on Raw or you want him...  You wish he was doing other things?  It's hard to say, dude.  It depends on what...  I don't know.  Like, bring back the TV show or what?  I don't know.  Or you don't mind him doing commercials and doing like...  Nah.  ...death appearances on Raw.  Or do you wish there's something out there you wish he was doing?  The only thing I wish Ozzy was doing is I would love to see...  I mean, he's done it all.  I don't know.  That's why I don't really have an answer for you when you say like what.  He's pretty much done it all.  I would say the only thing I would want Ozzy to do, which he's not currently doing, is 
[00:52:00]  make a new album with Sabbath, which is probably never going to happen because of the lawsuit  with Tony and whatever, you know.  And then when people heard that, they were like, what the fuck is he suing them for?  But then Ozzy's answer was, we all have kids.  And it's like, if Tony owns the name, well, who's to say what his kids are going to do  with the name, which is going to affect my grandchildren and Bill's grandchildren.  It's like, it sounds like, oh, he's just being a money whore, but he's not.  He's thinking of fucking...  He's thinking.  Right.  So I don't know.  To answer a tough question, but I don't mind him doing this stuff.  It's like, it's harmless.  It's like when he's in Trick or Treat with fucking Mark Price, he played a preacher who 
[00:52:30]  was anti-rock and roll.  You know what I mean?  And I remember back then, in the early 80s, people were like, he's fucking in a movie.  It's just different now for musicians than it was 20 years ago.  All right.  Wow.  Do you remember years ago if they used your music in a commercial, you were a sellout?  Oh, yeah.  Years ago, if they used your music in a commercial, you were a sellout.  Now it's cool.  Now it's fine.  That's just another way to market your music.  People, yeah.  They want their songs.  Metallica was a sellout because Lars didn't want his music being stolen. 
[00:53:00]  And all of a sudden, you know what?  It revolutionized fucking the way we buy music.  Because Lars was being a dick because he didn't want to put on a product that people just stole.  Yeah.  What a dick.  Yeah.  I was pissed.  I was.  Napster went fucking from being just a free place to go and get music to a pay service.  I was like, fuck, man.  Yeah, but we were all stupid because we weren't thinking about the other side where, wait,  if we continue to get all our music for free, there's going to be no business for these  guys. 
[00:53:30]  I know.  And we're not going to have any cool music to listen to.  You don't really look at the big picture.  We didn't want to acknowledge that part of it.  You don't look at the big picture.  We just assumed, I'm getting free too.  We just wanted them to keep putting out their music and we would get it for free.  Like back at NEW, we used to use Napster to just play songs that weren't in the catalog.  Of course.  Instead of running into the big WNEW huge rock catalog, what if we needed like a classical 
[00:54:00]  song or something like that?  It was tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a, get some Napster fucking thing and just play it on  the air, which is even worse.  I think everyone made their point.  I mean, the phone's just still ringing off the hook here.  That's a big thing.  People call you a sellout if you collaborate musically with somebody else.  Remember Aerosmith?  They were sellouts because they collaborated with Run DMC and did that crossover song.  Just that word gets thrown around.  It really bugs me.  And they didn't sell out until probably like 1990. 
[00:54:30]  Then they completely sold it.  All right.  We'll clear the phone lines, get into some other stuff.  We've got a busy show, by the way.  Speaking of the Osborne, Sharon Osborne in studio today with Bret Michaels.  Is Bret Michaels coming in?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Both of them will be here.  And she'll probably be the first one to go, oh, yeah, I sold out.  Give a shit.  And then Maria.  Fuck yourself.  Maria from the WWE calling in today.  Anyway, she was the one we were trying to get to admit she's on The Apprentice.  Oh, yeah.  All these people are on The Apprentice, these celebrity apprentices. 
[00:55:00]  Is that what the whole thing is?  Not only that, it's so obvious that they're like the last few left.  Well, now they're before.  So get Brie Bart on the phone.  I got a big announcement.  Sharon Osborne, Bret Michaels, and Maria went pretty far on The Celebrity Apprentice.  Watch them be the ones that were booted off the first week.  And they're just tricking everybody.  They look ridiculous.  And Jodie Sweetin in studio in about 20 minutes.  Who's she in?  Opie, if you remember, she was a child star back on, what the hell? 
[00:55:30]  Full House.  Full House.  That's right.  It was Full House.  Then she sold out and did meth.  Well, yeah, she got into a little bit of a jam up with, you know, some illegal drugs, some crystal meth, methadrine.  And Coke.  And Coke.  A little Coke action.  It's usually like wrecks you.  Wrecks you if you're a chick and you're, you know, doing meth and Coke.  But, uh, wow.  I mean.  She bounced back nice.  She looks really good. 
[00:56:00]  She sure does.  I don't know what happened there.  She sure does.  So she's coming in in about 20 minutes.  Coke fucking K.  Defying the odds.  And we'll go to a break with a clip from, uh, the Today Show yesterday.  Uh, Jodi Sweetin was on that show.  And this is what she had to say.  Ooh.  Let's just make sure we understand what we're talking about.  I mean, you were doing meth.  Yes.  You were doing cocaine.  And yet, you were managing in some ways to let the people around you think that everything was still pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, it was, um, it, I was leading, you know, two completely different lives. 
[00:56:30]  And, uh, that was something, you know, that I talk about in the book that I had kind of done all of my life was be, you know, two different people.  So you were still acting, basically.  Yeah, definitely.  You, you write in the book how, how once you did the drugs and you got into recovery.  Right.  That you went on kind of a recovery tour.  You started going out telling the story of recovery.  Right.  On television.  And, and, and you started to give speeches to you, to students at universities.  Right.  One of the things that stands out in the book to me is you were getting ready to go to Marquette University.  Right. 
[00:57:00]  To talk to students about recovery and what it was like to live clean and sober.  And you were anything but.  Right.  Checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hello.  Busy show today.  We got Jody, uh, Sweeten coming in.  Her new book is called Unsweetened.  I get it.  It's her memoir.  In bookstores and on Amazon.com right now. 
[00:57:30]  Memoir.  I don't have to kindle this motherfucker because I got it right in front of me.  That's right.  I'll still kindle it.  I'm a kindling motherfucker right now.  Oh.  I just downloaded a 900 page book on John Lennon.  Dear God.  I'm learning about John Lennon's great, great grandfather.  That, that was the first 20 pages.  Oh my God.  Get to the Beatles stuff.  And why he was a tortured artist. 
[00:58:00]  In Kindle, you can do a search.  Just search Beatles.  No, I know.  In the book.  Oh no, I know that.  But I'm going to, I'm going to like, I'm going to deal with it.  I'm learning about his aunts and his great uncles and this and that.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That we are.  Screw that.  I get it.  He, his mommy was a little weird and, you know, gave him up as a child and that influenced  him a little bit.  I was dull, dull, dull, incredibly dull.  All right.  So we got Jody coming in and then we got Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels in studio in about 
[00:58:30]  a half hour.  It's a, it's a lot of guests today.  And then Maria from the WWE is going to be calling in.  She's, she's cool when she calls the show.  So.  Oh yeah.  I do.  I don't remember.  You don't remember?  She was selling the fucking burgers and we're like, look, just admit your own.  Oh, that recently.  I thought it was a long time ago.  No.  And she came in studio and she made out with Lily.  Damn.  How do you forget that one, eh?  All right.  I do remember that.  And, uh, you know, she's on the Celebrity Apprentice and I think she's doing very well. 
[00:59:00]  Is she?  They're not.  How do you know?  Huh?  How do you know?  Because they're still calling us to promote shit.  You got an inside?  Unless like we said before break, Donald Trump is really tricking everyone and having all the ones  that got kicked out early doing all the press.  The losers.  But I gotta, you gotta think these are like the last ones left.  We're close to the last ones left.  Sharon Osbourne, Bret Michaels, and Maria from the WWE.  It also explains, by the way, part of Sharon's appearance on WWE is the Maria connection and  they can't say Celebrity Apprentice, but that could just be a way of putting her in everybody's 
[00:59:30]  face or on television so the next time you hear she's doing something, it's just another  way of remaining visible without actually saying it.  Ah.  Anthony, we had another Long Island home invasion.  What?  Yes.  This has, of course, always been a nightmare of mine.  I'm not giving any details out, but I am, um, I'm having my security revamped around the  compound.  Why?  It's already in progress. 
[01:00:00]  Why?  What happened?  Nothing happened, but that's how I want to keep it.  Paranoid?  Nope.  Mm-hmm.  Two words.  Safe room.  Oh, two words.  You're doing a safe room?  Doing?  Doing, my friend?  Are you building a panic room?  Doing?  Are you building a panic room?  Building?  It's there, baby.  I already know.  It's there.  Great, and the guys who are going to do the home invasion, the guys that built it, so 
[01:00:30]  they know where it is?  They know exactly where it is.  They know how to get in.  I would, I would say, I'm just going to write down the answer.  It's this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, uh, uh.  That whole, the, the, the, the, the, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  Obviously, the, uh, the thing, because I, I don't, I won't give away, uh, information,  but.  You got people, like, living there now.  Here it is, though.  You, you, you always have people there.  See, gun safes.  Very important when you own a lot of guns. 
[01:01:00]  They must be kept in a safe.  Correct.  Not just safe, in a safe.  Correct.  So, instead of getting a safe, I have turned an entire closet into a lockable, alarmed gun  safe.  And that way, uh, you can't, uh, just, you know, mosey on in and, and grab some stuff.  But, the trick is, it's also fine to step right in there and shut the door and hit the 
[01:01:30]  button, and that fucking door ain't opening, and, uh, and, uh, I, uh, you can, you can go  on my iPhone with an app and just start fucking working all kinds of shit around my house.  I thought you were going to say the iPhone will, will, like, fire your guns at this  point.  Uh, I'm getting there.  I'm getting, no, no, the, uh.  Good luck with the app when you can't get reception or your 3G network shuts down.  Fuck!  Meanwhile, your guests are being raped by the fucking, I don't care, I'm in there with  my guns. 
[01:02:00]  Trick or treaters.  Fuck them.  I know, you, if they don't make it by the time the door closes, it's going to be like  NORAD shutting up.  Do you have water in there and stuff like that or anything?  Oh, I'll get to the point where I am completely set up, but, you know, how long do I really  have to be in there unless, you know, things are really getting a little, you don't have  to be in there.  A little, uh, fuzzy around the edges.  You don't have to be in there at all.  What?  You're completely safe.  Home invasion.  Nah.  Oh, well, what story, what started this?  Home invasion along the way.  All right, well, let's listen to the latest home invasion. 
[01:02:30]  Let's see how this one worked and let's see what might have happened differently if  this man or woman or family or whatever had thought like Anthony.  All right, and you could walk us through this, what, uh, what went wrong here.  Uh-huh, let's, let's listen.  A mechanic at this garage has been arrested, charged with making a, he's a mechanic, he  doesn't have enough money to make himself safe.  Fuck him.  Well, he was arrested.  Oh, good.  He's the, he's the bad guy?  Yeah, he's the bad guy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you, what, you, you gotta start worrying about your mechanic now?  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm a mechanic.  You can't worry about everybody. 
[01:03:00]  That's bad.  They got tools.  I am, well.  A mechanic at this garage has been arrested, charged with making a frightening house call.  Police say he forced his way into a customer's home, robbed her, threatened to kill her,  her family, and even burn her house down.  This is the knife police say that was pressed against her neck by auto mechanic Roman Gineo,  who threatened, robbed, and terrorized his 60-year-old victim.  He came in, he cut the phone line right away, demanded the safe, and actually placed the  knife right to her throat.  It happened in this upscale Great Neck Estates neighborhood.  Oh, guess who used to live there? 
[01:03:30]  Who?  You?  Anthony.  Anthony who?  Gumia.  Gumia.  I used to live there.  You did?  I certainly did.  Oh, that's fucking fantastic.  Well, they're not gonna go to wine dance.  They're gonna go where the houses might have some shit in it.  Exactly.  Exactly.  They do.  They do.  They go, and all of Long Island is readily, like, is right near major highways.  There isn't much of Long Island that isn't by a major highway. 
[01:04:00]  So, it's the perfect opportunity for these vandals and crooks and...  Oh, I better not use that.  Yeah.  You already did twice, vandals and crooks.  Wow.  Man in the safe and actually placed the knife right to her throat.  It happened in this upscale Great Neck Estates neighborhood.  The victim, too upset to go on camera, did tell her she was so scared she gave Gineo,  who she recognized from the service station, all the cash she had, a thousand bucks, 
[01:04:30]  and even wrote him a check for four grand.  Exactly.  After the traumatic ordeal, she told her she had no intention of going to police,  but was so rattled she couldn't function, and her friends knew something was wrong.  Police aren't sure if Gineo would have preyed on his frightened victim again,  or if he did the same thing to other customers.  The manager at the service station was at a loss for words.  He was just in Korea.  That's all I know.  Why wouldn't you go to the police if you know the guy that did it?  She was so scared, and she wrote him a check.  I hope she post-dated it, like, to call the cops. 
[01:05:00]  Hey, could you not cash this for a while?  I've got to make a deposit.  Okay.  Unbelievable.  Well, uh...  That's just a kook, Anthony.  Here's the problem.  Yeah, that seems a little more kooky.  That's just a kook.  But, you know what?  A kook in your house is no different than somebody that's a little more organized.  Uh, gun beat knife.  You ever play rock, paper, scissors?  Uh-huh.  Gun beat knife.  So a guy comes in with knife, you're defending house with gun, you win.  See, that's how it works.  You win. 
[01:05:30]  You don't let him put a knife to the throat of your youngster like that to get your money.  It's insanity.  Wait, did he put a knife to a kid?  That's what he said, right?  I thought it was to the old woman.  I thought it was to the old woman.  He sounded like six.  Was it an old woman?  Yeah, she was an old woman.  I thought it was an old woman, but I don't really feel like playing the audio game if  you don't mind.  I thought it said 60.  All right, yeah, but well, you know.  He probably just scared her and said, I'll come back and kill you.  Yeah, I thought there was somebody else in the house.  Where was it?  I barely listened.  Okay, everyone's saying it's an old woman.  Yeah, okay.  Let's go with that.  A 60-year-old woman. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Hmm.  Wow, I certainly heard that differently.  So she should have had a gun in her car?  Well, you know, unfortunately, it's very hard for people to obtain, legally, it's hard  for people to obtain firearms.  So, you're not seeing kooks.  No.  Thank God for that.  Thank God for the Second Amendment and people that are dedicated to going through the process  and legally getting a pistol permit.  I strongly endorse the National Rifle Association and the people's right to bear arms. 
[01:06:30]  So if, you know, the nut walks in and you've got a gun on you, you win.  Just blow holes in them?  You go, hey, mechanic guy, get the fuck out of my house with your knife.  And then they might see your heater, like I like calling it a heater or a rod.  And, uh, you pull heat out.  Do you shoot?  What?  No.  Not unless he charges at you with a knife.  No, he's in your house.  Do you shoot?  It all depends.  I wouldn't instantly just shoot an intruder in my house. 
[01:07:00]  I'm asking you.  He's got a knife.  It's up in the air, like, argh.  Is he approaching me?  Uh, he's just up in the air.  Arr.  Up in the air?  All right, no.  Point and say, get the fuck out.  All right.  The second he starts approaching you.  One step forward?  Yeah.  You could actually, you probably would get away with shooting him, even if he's in  your house with the knife.  I would say, you know, a grand jury isn't really going to fuck you over on that one.  But coming at you with the knife, you're well within your means.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yes.  Yes, sir. 
[01:07:30]  Whoa.  So you could get in trouble.  Guy has a knife in the air, but he's not officially approaching you.  But he's in your house.  And you shoot.  You could actually be in trouble for that?  Yeah, there are certain bullshits where if he is retreating.  Even in your own house?  In your own house.  No, I understand the retreating bullshit if you shoot him in the back.  You never want to shoot him in the back.  You've got to make sure.  No, no, not.  If he's running away, you better be able to run faster and get in front of him.  If he's backing out of the house with a knife up.  That's bullshit, too.  But there's things called the castle doctrine, which isn't in New York. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  But states like Texas have it and stuff, where if someone's in your house, you may shoot them.  Of course.  That's how it should be.  And there's no ifs, ands, buts, or why.  But that's how it should be.  You're defending your house.  If they have a weapon and they're in your house, why are they arguing that?  You should be able to shoot if you've got a gun.  Because it is not legal to use deadly physical force to protect property in New York State.  You don't know that if they're in your fucking house?  Exactly.  I understand the rules here.  What dumb politician is arguing that shit?  It's every dumb Democrat that is throwing hurdles in front of law-abiding citizens that want to defend their family, 
[01:08:30]  their property themselves, by legally using the Second Amendment to protect themselves.  But you'll never get past a Chuck Schumer or that fucking Caroline McCarthy bitch out on Long Island.  I can't stand her.  I hope she gets thrown out of office.  Maybe if somebody had a gun on the train, Colin Ferguson wouldn't have gotten to your husband and son.  You dummy.  That's how it works, dummy. 
[01:09:00]  The bad guys will always have the guns.  Maybe if somebody had a legal, licensed handgun concealed on their person and that Colin Ferguson nut was going through shooting people systematically down the aisle of the train,  they'd have taken his bonehead off and your family would still be in one piece.  But no, you've got to run for a fucking office after that and decide that your priority now is to take guns away from people that might have saved your family, you dunce. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, I hate her.  Colin Ferguson's gun was legal.  What?  No, it wasn't.  The guy was a kook.  He wasn't even allowed to have a gun.  I'm stunned by the fact that you can't shoot an intruder in your own house when they have a weapon.  I'm stunned by that.  You can.  How the fuck are you supposed to?  You can.  What, you're going to argue it with the guy?  Get out of my fucking house?  You might be indicted.  You'd probably be acquitted, but you'd have to go through all that.  It all depends on what the assessment is, what happened. 
[01:10:00]  The investigators will come in and they will look at things and say, all right, this is purely self-defense.  We won't even present this to a grand jury.  Anthony, I understand that, but just knowing there's a possibility that you could get fucked because there's an intruder in your house with a weapon is mind-boggling to me.  Mind-fucking-boggling.  If he holds the knife and then goes, if he holds the knife up and then goes, oh my God, wait a minute, I'm so sorry, I'll leave you alone.  No one will know that if he's dead.  Well, I know, but you know something, there's all kinds of things. 
[01:10:30]  No one will know that, fuck that.  And the other thing is, oh yeah, the intruder.  Yeah.  Does he know all these rules?  The average intruder?  Probably not.  No, the average intruder.  Average intruder?  But no, I would say no.  Why?  You don't think they brush up on this shit?  No, they're stupid.  You never think you're going to get caught.  They're not.  They usually, when they break into a place, they're thinking no one is armed.  First of all, that's number one.  When they break in, they are assuming, and well, they should, because the odds are with them that the homeowner is not armed with a firearm. 
[01:11:00]  But I got a thing here.  Yeah.  I'm going somewhere with this.  All right.  So if the intruder doesn't know this shit, he's got to just assume, like, I got to be aggressive as a motherfucker if I'm in someone's house.  Or he's got to assume that if this person does have a gun, I best get the fuck out of the house as quickly as possible.  I understand that.  Yeah.  But you don't know that for sure.  All of a sudden, you know, the homeowner finds their gun.  You know what I'm trying to say?  Yeah.  If the intruder doesn't know that, you know, the homeowner could be in trouble for shooting them. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  They're going to be an aggressive motherfucker in your house.  Might be.  Yeah.  It might.  It might be.  Put your mind around this.  But if somebody's being aggressive now, then you shoot them.  You're defending your life.  They would be aggressive anywhere else.  Yeah, but still, an investigator could come in and the fucking guy falls the wrong way or something weird.  And all of a sudden, they're like, well, this guy wasn't that threatening.  You're right.  But there's that old saying.  It's a weird fucking chance there.  I'd rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6, my friend. 
[01:12:00]  Who said that?  That's somebody that probably is in prison.  Yeah, I think that's one of those.  Was it John Wayne?  Judged by 12, then carried by 6.  You study up on all of the laws for use of deadly physical force, and you have to know  your weapon.  You've got to practice with it.  And then if push comes to shove and there is a moment, that snap decision moment has to  be made.  You have to assess the situation and decide what to do. 
[01:12:30]  Speaking of a jury, give me a jury.  My jury.  Remember the jury phone call?  My jury.  Or the fucking outtakes from Orson Welles?  Yes.  What was that movie called?  The famous movie, 12 Angry?  12 Angry Men.  That's right.  Yeah.  Do you know that the fucking PC police have got a hold of that one, too?  Why?  Do you know that someone I know is going to be in a play which used to be called the 12  Angry Men, and now it's called the 12 Angry Jurors? 
[01:13:00]  That's not how the guy wrote the fucking thing.  Because there's women in there.  Right.  Oh, Christ.  The PC police got a hold of that one, too.  Now it's called the 12 Angry Jurors.  All the high school kids.  12 Angry people that don't want to be there.  All the high school kids don't realize that their original name is 12 Angry Men.  It's now 12 Angry Jurors.  Right.  Fuck.  What the fuck?  Why do you guys want to talk today, you fuckers?  Everybody wants to talk today. 
[01:13:30]  I guess that's what happens when you do a talk show, huh?  Mike in Boston.  Mike!  Or Boffiston?  Boffiston.  Mike shot someone, and then he threw the gun down and walked out of the restaurant.  That was a movie.  Got them both.  That was a fucking movie.  That doesn't happen in real life.  Never heard of that one?  That's stupid.  Yeah.  Mike Gay.  I think because we're talking about political offices and death, we should just remind you  guys that today is voting day in Boston and your friend Mumbles might be going down.  He has a challenger today. 
[01:14:00]  Does he?  What are the percentages there, I wonder?  Hmm.  I have no idea what the guy's name is.  I just know I'm voting for him instead of Mumbles.  So how is he going down if you don't even know the guy's name?  You don't know his name.  Don't you understand how politics works?  I don't even know who Bloomberg is going up against because Bloomberg spent all the  fucking money on campaigning.  Bloomberg spent more money than any mayoral candidate in the history of the United States  of America.  Try right now.  Yes.  Bloomberg against who?  He's running against that fucking controller. 
[01:14:30]  That should be on the tip of your tongue, though.  It should just be, see, Thompson.  Ah, Thompson.  But see, it took a while for us to think about it.  I don't get to vote for him.  I don't get to vote for him.  Jody Sweet.  Oh, hi.  Oh, my God.  Wow, she's running.  Holy Jesus Christ.  All right, we got to go, Mike.  Okay, Mike.  Holy shit.  All right, you want to get Jody in here or you want to talk about home invasions? 
[01:15:00]  Holy shit.  Hey, you guys on the home invasion thing, call back because we got Jody Sweet outside our studio.  From Full House, you know?  Look at Jimmy putting a stick of gum in his mouth.  Well, you know what if I can have coffee breath in.  Jimmy's putting gum in his mouth.  Everybody's primping.  I know.  Put a sock in my pants.  I actually combed my hair today.  Oh.  I put a little moose in it.  Wow.  Do you even use moose?  Is moose still a product?  Moose.  A product you could use for your hair?  I don't think so.  Sam, what are you doing?  Get Jody in here.  What the fuck? 
[01:15:30]  Sam.  Bring her in.  Set her mic up there.  Entering our studio is Jody Sweeten.  She's got a new book out called Unsweetened, Jody's New Memoir.  Yes.  In bookstores and on Amazon.com.  Hi.  She's promoting.  And also, I think you could get it on Kindle, I'm sure, right?  You could Kindle that.  The book?  Yeah.  I certainly hope so.  Yeah.  I would assume.  Oh.  My head's too small.  There we go.  You got it.  Hi.  Good to meet you.  Hi.  We want to warn you.  We're really good friends with Bob Saget.  Perfect. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  We love Bob Saget.  I love Bob Saget.  And he's a psychopath.  And he is.  He really is.  In a wonderful way.  He defends all of you guys.  He'll make fun of everybody except you girls.  Yeah.  He really is.  He really shouldn't.  He really should pick on us first because we're the easiest targets.  Well, I speak for myself anyway.  And he's like the worst.  He comes across like the father figure and then you talk to him in private.  He is a disgusting human being.  He really is.  And I say that with love.  Yeah, so do I.  No, he is.  I absolutely love and adore Bob. 
[01:16:30]  Now, we're all learning that he's very dirty.  Right.  Do you guys know that he was a dirty comic when you were doing Full House?  This is old news.  Yes.  I've known it for years.  But no one out there in American news.  Right.  It was a secret until recently.  Right.  And, you know, I think part of it, too, is trying to be the anti-Danny.  Yeah.  But, you know, I know it for years.  I mean, he used to get in trouble on the set with the moms and stuff, you know, for some  of the things that he would do.  The kids could watch the monitors backstage and he wouldn't realize it. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah, let's just say there were a few incidents.  There was, like, a Michelle doll that they used as a stand-in.  Oh, no.  A stand-in?  Well, right.  The lean-in, really.  They just sort of leaned it up against the table.  But, I mean, they used that, you know, to rehearse with.  And sometimes Michelle took it a little.  Did some awful things to it?  She's in some awful things to that poor doll.  He is sick.  All right.  We're all thinking that, so I got to say it.  You smell fucking amazing.  Me?  Thank you. 
[01:17:30]  I don't even know what you said the last 60 seconds.  It's like potpourri.  Why, thank you?  I'm dying over here.  What is that?  Thank you.  I have no idea.  I don't know.  It's a little bottle that I had in, like, my travel bag.  Does it?  You wear a land-ut-tomp, but not today.  Twisted ass.  Jimmy just put that gum in, because he's scared he might have bad breath.  I don't have bad breath, but I just drank coffee.  Let me see.  No, you're good.  You're okay.  You smell like bubble gum.  Yeah.  It's because my breath is fine.  When you drink coffee, though, you don't want to talk to her about coffee breath.  It's creepy.  Well, I'm going to have coffee breath soon. 
[01:18:00]  Hopefully, I get some coffee and might actually wake up a little bit here.  I don't know.  I think you want to sip of mine.  You can compensate for it.  Hello, H1N1.  Thank you very much.  Oh, I thought you were going to say, wait, what is herpes, too?  Well, right, H1N1 and H2.  Is it HSV2?  Right, right, right, right.  I love letters.  You know all that.  Right.  I can't even spell.  Sitting next to you.  Now, of course, the book, wow, a lot of revelations in there.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:18:30]  Things have been kind of on the Internet for a while and stuff about you, you, you.  Well, right, and half of that's true.  Really?  Oh, my God.  I was reading something the other day.  It was hilarious, actually.  And it was, you know, it was on some random plastic surgery site or something.  It was like, she's probably had her skin laser resurfaced because of all the drugs she did.  And apparently she said that on Good Morning America she was missing five teeth.  These are all my real teeth.  I'd never had my skin resurfaced.  They're talking about the scar on my arm that I had from, like, a surgery thing, but it wasn't from a bad boob job. 
[01:19:00]  I mean, my God, I'd sue the doctor that did that.  I think we said that yesterday.  Yeah, we saw that picture yesterday.  Yeah, you.  So we helped that one along.  No, the second we said you were going to be on, we got, of course, we get just inundated with photos and links and everything like that.  Right.  So we popped that one on.  It's the other set of twins.  By the way, I just opened the book.  This is why I'm going to enjoy this book.  The first thing I see on page 73, it was during this period that I started cocaine for the first time.  Oh, this is going to be a funny thing.  The first thing I just looked at when I opened the book. 
[01:19:30]  You know what, and I don't.  Second year on Full House.  Right, right.  That's seven.  No, you know, and I mean, I don't joke about this stuff.  I mean, I don't take it lightly.  I mean, it was, I went through some really dark, really serious stuff.  And, you know, I talk about it a lot in the book.  But, you know, I've gotten to a place in my life now where, you know, I really, I'm in a really good place in my life.  And writing this book was a real way for me to, you know, it was a way for me to get a lot, get a lot off my chest.  Well, you're very young, right?  So you kind of partied. 
[01:20:00]  Because I did a lot of that, too, when I was young, and then I quit when I was 18.  So how old were you when you stopped?  Well, I'll have a year sober on December 8th.  Oh, wow, cool.  Yeah, so almost a year.  So I was, you know, 26.  Oh, that's great.  How the hell do you manage to look really good when you just fucking ravage yourself with drugs for that long?  What happened?  I've watched Cops, man.  I've seen what, I've watched that show.  You see what the drugs can do to the skin.  It's really.  You don't have the bad skin.  Like, not just that, but everything. 
[01:20:30]  Like, you just start, you don't look good.  And then you come in here, you know, Hollywood.  Well, you know, I mean, that was, fortunately or unfortunately, that was sort of how I got away with it for a long time, was that it didn't, you know, I mean, I looked tired.  I looked, you know, I would party for a couple days at a time.  No sleep will wear on you a little bit.  But, I mean, I never had, you know, that haggard, like, drugged out look.  And so, I think a lot of times people didn't have any idea because, you know, I didn't look like, you know, the typical drug user. 
[01:21:00]  And that was something I talk about in the book, too, is that, you know, there's a lot of people out there that do, that are, you know, doing, especially like crystal meth or stuff like that, that people would never expect.  That don't look like, you know, the people that you see in the, you know, the PSAs and stuff like that, that, you know, are missing teeth and, you know, cracked out on the street.  So, I mean, that, you know, helped me get away with it for a little bit longer.  And you were, you were, like, relatively functional, I guess. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, I mean, right.  You know, it's a sliding scale of functional.  But, um, I, you know, I was able to, for the most part, show up for things.  And, you know.  How old were you when this happened?  Like, you started doing coke and stuff because I didn't cheat to the age.  Um, I, I experimented with cocaine, like, when I was in, in college a couple times.  Um, and then I, then I had a period of sobriety, um, which I, I really, I, I was not drinking and I wasn't using, but I really wasn't getting sober and getting my life together in a lot of ways.  Um, but, you know, I started doing that. 
[01:22:00]  And then when I, when I started drinking again, that's when I got back into the heavy drugs, like around early 20s, like 20, 122.  How do you hide it when you're married to a police officer?  That was the, that's a biggie.  You know, I, um, it, it was, I think there, you know, was probably part of it that was not, him not wanting to know.  But in a lot of ways, I was able to cover it up.  I mean, he worked all night, so I could be up all night, out all night.  You know, by the time he would come home, I'd be laying in bed for a little while and then he'd go to sleep and I'd get up again. 
[01:22:30]  So it was, you know, the, the scheduling of it a lot of times.  And then, you know, like I said, I was still functioning.  I was still going, you know, there was a period of time there I was still going to school.  I graduated, um, you know, I was functioning and living my quote-unquote normal life and, you know.  But there wasn't even really any scandalous things written about you.  Like, you know, obviously you got the Olsen twins, whatever they were doing was being written about and everything.  And you just kind of slid in under the radar. 
[01:23:00]  You know, I did.  I mean, there was only, I think, one time that something came out in, like, the Enquirer or something that said, you know, Jodie Sweetin's back drinking again or whatever.  But that came and went pretty quick.  And, uh, other than that, I mean, and it's not like I was, you know, keeping a low profile.  I mean, I was going out all the time to L.A. clubs and I was, you know, out drinking and partying pretty noticeably.  But I just managed to sort of slide right in.  Did you just have it with the Olsen twins, like, everyone counting down when they were going to be 18 and you sitting there going, what about me?  Right. 
[01:23:30]  What about me?  Nobody cared when I turned 18.  I love how you say everyone.  Like, you had a fucking, an atomic clock in the office.  Right, right, right.  I'm sure, yeah, he's blaming everyone.  All those other assholes.  And, you know, he's like.  Wait, some people said we started that whole thing, you know.  Everybody was very curious.  Because we started at 14.  Some people.  Right, right, right.  That's true.  You were counting down until they turned 15 because there's, you know, some sort of, like, legal consent, right?  And you're way hotter than the Olsen twins.  So I don't know what we were thinking.  Olsen twins just did not grow into. 
[01:24:00]  You were walking down the hall.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, no kidding.  We were following the wrong ones.  Yeah.  Pick the wrong horse in that race.  Mistakes, mistakes, fellas.  No, I'm just kidding.  So what are you doing now?  Like, are you married?  I know you have.  No, God, no.  No, no, God, no.  God, no.  No, twice.  Two at this point.  And divorced and twice.  Is it, huh?  Yeah.  I have my daughter who's almost 19 months old.  And she is absolutely amazing.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful little girl.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Zoe.  Yeah.  That's like your game.  That's my, I mean, I'm doing that right now.  I have the book stuff coming out.  You know, letters of intent signed for a couple projects.  So a couple movies of the week and things like that.  You know, but we'll say, I mean, I want to get back into acting.  It's what I love to do.  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, I'm just trying to kind of juggle that, being a mom.  Do you think that had anything to do with it?  Like everybody, that whole child actor thing, man, has got some stigma on it.  Well, you know, what I always say is that I don't know necessarily that being a child  actor makes you this.  I think that you, a lot of these people might have had these issues anyway, but we wouldn't 
[01:25:00]  have known about it.  And it wouldn't have been so shocking and so, you know, oh my God, they're doing drugs.  I mean, there's tons of probably adult actors that are out there doing drugs and stuff.  But because we didn't watch them grow up as a kid, it's not so shocking and it doesn't  make news because, you know, nobody really gives a shit.  I just thought because you were like really in the, I guess in the public eye forever.  I mean, there's those little beauty contest things and were you kind of just pushed in?  No, you know what?  I wasn't. 
[01:25:30]  And I mean, the thing is, you know, I did, it's so funny.  My mom's always like, don't tell people you did pageants because I think I didn't think  you were like JonBenet.  Yeah.  And like, I mean, like now beauty pageants, they're like little, like, like baby prostitutes.  It's really sick.  It's really creepy.  They're like big tan acrylics and shit.  But I didn't do that.  Like I did, you know, it was like dancing and, you know, wearing pretty dresses and  curling your hair.  It wasn't anything like crazy.  And I loved to do it.  Like if there was an audience of one, even though it was just me dancing in the mirror,  like I would dance and perform.  Oh, totally. 
[01:26:00]  And, you know, so I was never something that I was pushed into by my parents.  My parents are very normal, very down to earth, un-Hollywood type people.  And you never felt like you were missing out on something by being on set from like five years  old?  No, you know what I mean?  And I, and the thing is like, I look back, I mean, like I, I was always mad.  I felt like I missed out on things like, you know, I missed out on sixth grade outdoor  camp because we were in Walt Disney World for two weeks.  You know what I mean?  And I was like, oh God, my life's over.  Like I'm not going to, and my mom's like, you're going to look back on this one day and  you're going to be thinking you're an idiot because you got to go to Walt Disney World 
[01:26:30]  for two weeks.  You know, so I look back on it now and it's like maybe the things that I'm, you know, missed  out on, I really, I got paid back tenfold for some of the experiences that I got.  Was that the time where the twins got lost at Disney World?  No, that was a very special episode.  Yes, yes, it was.  Where they got lost.  It was.  You really do follow them.  It's a little creepy.  Well, no, I just.  It's the new Brady Bunch.  It's on all the time.  Yeah, it's everywhere.  It's on all the time.  I'm just saying he happens to know all the Michelle storylines.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true. 
[01:27:00]  No, I remember your storylines with your little pal there.  What's her name there with the dark hair?  Wow, that's, that's impressive.  That was really impressive.  That was, that was the worst save ever.  That's really good.  She's going to go back to drugs after that.  Yeah, yeah.  Way to remember her.  Way to remember what she was all about.  Yeah, what's that other chick's name?  What was finally what made you stop?  Like, what was the bottom?  You know, for me, like the last, the last time that I actually drank was not, I mean,  it wasn't, you know, the most drunk I've ever been or the worst experience for me. 
[01:27:30]  It was just, for me, it was the, it was the most emotionally painful, I guess.  It was just the time that I, you know, I started realizing, I mean, I was going through the  divorce stuff and, and, you know, I was, um, custody of my daughter.  There was a lot of issues with that.  And I just started realizing, like, that's not, that's not the person that I wanted to  be.  It's not the mom I wanted to be.  I just really, I wanted to, I wanted to get my shit together, you know?  And I, and my life was, um, I was kind of at a crossroads, you know, I could either really  commit myself and, and, and jump into this, you know, a hundred percent and, and get my 
[01:28:00]  life together, or, you know, I, I would continue down the same path that I was going before.  And things are too good right now.  Really too good right now.  And what kind of jackass offers you, like, coke and meth?  Like, who, who got you into that?  Like, was it just the party scene?  Well, I mean, yeah, you know what I mean?  There was people that I, you know, I was hanging out with that did it, like I said, who didn't  look, you know, who had jobs, who had families, who, you know, it wasn't like they were, you  know, some crazy crackheads on the corner. 
[01:28:30]  It was fine if they were doing it to be like, Hey, you ever try this?  Right.  Well, you know what?  It's just a low life thing to do.  Well, thank you.  No, I mean on your part, I mean on the part of the person giving it to you.  Right.  Well, they're giving it to me and I took it.  I mean, you know, it takes, it takes two to tango.  It doesn't, it's, you know, it's not entirely anyone else's fault when I take full responsibility  and accountability for, you know, I did some really, really dumb, stupid, unfortunate things.  Some of them I wish I could go back and change, but, you know, a lot of them have really gotten 
[01:29:00]  me to the point that I am now.  And, you know, it took, it took a lot of those things to make me realize that like, I just  can't, it's just not an option.  I just can't, I can't drink.  I can't, you know, occasionally smoke pot.  It's just not me.  Were you a blackout drinker?  Yeah.  Yeah.  From the beginning.  Oh, shit.  I was the blackout drinkers were luckier.  I was, I was partial blackout, so I'd always remember just enough to feel like a complete  asshole.  I was in mind the blackout drinkers.  Or you had the people that would be like, oh my God, you didn't, you know, I was like,  nah, uh-uh.  No, that wasn't. 
[01:29:30]  I don't even tell.  I don't want to know.  I don't want to, and you know, and, and there were, I mean, I did a lot of, just a lot of  really dumb things.  And luckily a lot of them weren't, were not photographed.  Some of them were.  Some of them, no, I mean, some of them like, no, no, no, no, I don't mean like that.  I mean like terrible, you know, that horrible picture of me at area giving my ex a lap  dancer.  All right.  I mean, and it's the thing that like haunts you, you know, that every, everyone's like,  look at this picture.  And you're like, oh God.  It's like, ah, it's only the internet.  It won't be there forever.  Yeah.  Right. 
[01:30:00]  But you know, I mean, it, it, I was, I was the sort of person from the, from the beginning  that just, it was very obvious that I could not drink or use like any sort of normal person.  When was the first, uh, first drink actually?  Um, first time I actually drank and got completely drunk was, well, no, the first time I got  drunk was, I was probably about 14.  I mean, I'd probably had a sip of alcohol here and there, but really nothing.  I mean, not anything substantial, but at that point it was actually at Candace Cameron's  wedding.  Um, that's great. 
[01:30:30]  A little, a little champagne with a toast and it was actually like three bottles of  red wine.  Like I would, they started pouring at, at my seat at the table.  My mom was like way across the room and immediately when she saw I wasn't sitting at her table,  she was like, oh God, this is not going to be good.  Who held your hair when you puked?  I actually did sort of a face plant into the toilet and like just, yeah, it was, it's in  the book.  Yeah.  You know, and I'm laughing about this now.  It's really, it's not funny.  No, no, but you know, a little, a little, no, but it's, it's not funny. 
[01:31:00]  Uh, it's, it's, you know, it's my story and you know, I guess I have to be able to look  at it with some sort of, you know, uh, lighthearted and I don't, not lighthearted.  Is that the wrong word?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's the thing, you know, you've got to, there's nothing wrong with that  because you pulled yourself out of it.  It's not like, you know, uh, you think of like Dana Plato or something and go, holy shit,  you know.  Right.  I would, you know, I wouldn't be laughing if I was dead.  No, no, no, you wouldn't, that's all.  I used to call the FBI when I was drunk.  If I don't laugh at that, I'm going to throw myself off a cliff. 
[01:31:30]  You were an agent.  I was a fool.  He did.  He actually called the FBI.  I was a fool.  I was a phone, were you a phone person?  The worst when you're being a fucking, when you're a phone drunk.  Oh, the, the drunk guy.  I didn't know why I was thinking your problems out.  I would call people and say that.  Yeah.  No, I don't, I, I probably did that.  I don't know, but I don't remember.  So I'm sure that I'll have friends going, yeah, yeah, you did.  You did.  I remember that one.  Right.  And then, um, like, what are you doing now as far as trying to get back into, uh, acting? 
[01:32:00]  Um, you know what, I'm, I'm, I'm starting to audition again.  I mean, like I said, it's been, it's, it's, things have been in a real transitional period  for me.  I mean, I'm going through this divorce and, you know, custody of my daughter and everything.  So, you know, trying to kind of get all that lined up and balance being a mom and getting  back into work.  And, and the book really for the past year has taken up a lot of time writing and editing  and, um, you know, my writer, John and I were working on it constantly.  So, you know, there's, that kind of took up a lot of, a lot of my time, but, you know,  we'll see what happens now.  Is it like amicable or is it one of those real nasty rock and roll divorces? 
[01:32:30]  You know, it's, it, it's not fun.  Um, some days are better than others, but yeah, it's bad.  It's never good.  You know, it's not pretty, but you know, the lawyers, they just are like, if only you  could just stand in a room and try to speak reasonably to people.  Well, right, but he, right, well, and he and I don't speak reasonably to each other.  So that's, you know, yeah, it's, it's just, you know, it's, we do, we do our best and,  and, you know, we try and do our best for Zoe and, you know, he's, he is a good dad to 
[01:33:00]  her and he loves her a lot.  So, you know, I, I, I gotta say like, you know, although he and I don't get along, you know,  he is there for his daughter.  So that's important.  How long were you married to him for?  Uh, well, we knew each other for six weeks before we got married and very good.  What the hell are you waiting for?  Good decision making right there.  Wait, what was that about?  What was that about, though?  I'm going to slide through that one.  Yeah, no, you can't slide through that.  Shit.  Six weeks and then you were married? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Where'd you meet?  Vegas.  And then we got married in Vegas.  She's looking down.  She's twisting her head for a car.  Well, you know what?  Every time I tell the story, it gets, every time I tell the story, I go, this just sounds  terrible.  It's stupid.  It's just horrible.  Like, you know, when the words are coming out of your mouth, where did you meet?  We met in Vegas.  How long did you know what you did?  Six weeks.  Where did you get married?  We met, we got married in Vegas and I didn't tell my parents.  Like, I mean, all of those, it was just, it was just a, you know, series of unquieting moments. 
[01:34:00]  And how old were you at the time?  This was, I was 26.  26.  26?  Yeah, we were, um, we were together six weeks.  We got married.  Um, we were married a little over a year, about 15 months.  Well, it was like 17 months total, our relationship.  Yeah.  Wow.  Whoa.  That is fast track.  Right.  But I got my daughter out of it.  So, you know what?  All of it was worth it.  What do you do for fun now?  No more Vegas trips, I'm sure.  You know what?  I, yeah, no, no more Vegas trips. 
[01:34:30]  I mean, if you're not partying and all that, I mean, that's the tough thing.  How do you preoccupy your time?  The thing is, is I've, I honestly have gotten to a place now where, you know, for a long  time, like, like I said, the first time that I got sober when I was like 19, I was, you  know, although I wasn't drinking or using anymore, it was the constant thought of like,  oh man, this sucks.  Everyone around me is drinking and I wish I could drink and I would, you know, if I could  just have one, if I could figure out how to do it normally, if I could just smoke a bowl,  you know, like shit like that.  And now it's to a point where I'm like, it's just not a thought.  Like it's, I can go out with friends. 
[01:35:00]  I can go out dancing.  I can, you know, I can, I loved going out dancing actually.  And you know, I have other friends that are sober.  Like I go out with them and it's just not a thought anymore.  I can go anywhere and do anything that I, you know, that I used to, I mean, not like I  really want to hang out with people that are, you know, doing blow and stuff, but right.  But I mean, I can be around people drinking and it doesn't bother me anymore.  It's not like I'm sitting there going, you know, it's just, you know what, I don't do  that.  And I can still have a really good time and be just as silly and fun and crazy and not  have to worry about it.  What I've found works is I go over to people who have drinks in their hands and I slap 
[01:35:30]  it out of their hands and I yell, poison!  Put a swizzle stick in your drink.  I've made that mistake a few times.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you don't mean to.  And you grab one a couple of times.  I've grabbed, I think two or three times in a lot of years.  Wow.  And it's like, it's nasty.  Right.  FBI!  No, I didn't swallow it.  It was a gin and tonic one time.  Right, right, right.  You've got to watch it.  Yeah, you have to be kind of careful with that.  But, you know, it's my life today. 
[01:36:00]  Like, I go out and, you know, I still have a good time.  I'm still young.  I'm 27.  But I'm a mom, too.  So a lot of my time now is sort of devoted to having fun with her.  Yeah, you have something to do.  Right.  It's like Jimmy just dumps himself into stand-up comedy and, you know, prostitutes have  questionable sexuality.  But, you have...  What?  What do you mean?  Well, you want to explain it to her?  Or you want to...  He's implying that I've switched...  He's implying that I've switched traditions.  Right.  From sex and drugs.  From drugs and alcohol to sex. 
[01:36:30]  But sex was always there.  Right, right, right.  That was just like a...  I had the ism since I was a little boy.  Sex started it all.  It was always about running away from gym.  I mean, it's terrible.  We have to get her out of here.  Yeah.  Your people have coats on and everything.  Where are you going next?  I believe I'm going to the CW Morning News.  Oh, cool.  But then I'm back.  I'm back at Sirius.  I think I'm doing a couple other shows, so...  Tell Jill...  There's a girl over there, Jill Nicolini.  Tell her I said hi.  At CW?  Yeah.  She's got big boobies. 
[01:37:00]  I was going to say, did you sleep with her?  You had sex with her.  Yes, he did.  Now you want...  Oh, look at the guilty look.  Yes, he did.  Now who's twisting their...  You want to talk about her relationship on the fast track.  Whoa, was that one...  Can you imagine her on Coke, by the way?  Oh, my God.  You're talking a lot now.  I can't even imagine.  She's probably sullen and sterling.  People usually switch.  Were you fun, Coke, Anne?  Or were you kind of like really nasty?  No.  I mean, you know what?  I think everyone gets to that point where you just turn into a bitch after you're using  stuff.  But I wasn't stolen. 
[01:37:30]  I wasn't whatever.  I mean, I was, you know...  I had personality.  The first time the Coke was like fun, and then the whole rest of the night was trying  to get more Coke.  Right.  And it just wasn't good.  And then, you know, the worst part is the come down, and you're suicidal and going,  oh, God, this is the worst thing I've ever done.  I'm never going to do that again.  You can't see it.  It's not...  You know what?  My life today, I mean, moments like that, I look back and I'm like, you know what?  I don't miss that shit at all.  Like, it's too good.  That's...  We have to get her out of here.  The Coke is...  All right.  Unsweetened.  Jodi's new memoir in bookstores and on Amazon.com.  It sounds like it's going to be a great read. 
[01:38:00]  You know what?  I've gotten some really good reviews from it from a lot of people that have read it,  so I'm really excited about it.  I need to picture you because I'm with you because I put it on Classmates and say you're  my girlfriend.  Okay, perfect.  All right.  We're going to do this.  Could you sign the...  We'll be back.  Not in the same class.  Is this us?  Yep.  We're back live.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  And now we've got Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels in studio.  Yeah.  Very busy day.  Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  This is kind of a weird combo, the Bret Michaels-Sharon Osbourne thing.  No.  Are you guys friends? 
[01:38:30]  It's supposed to happen for years and years.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  It's just...  It's different.  That's all.  Bret's probably like, yeah, I remember she yelled at me back in 97.  No.  No, no, no.  She shut the elevator.  We were in Wellington.  We're down in New Zealand doing a show together.  We were opening for Ozzy down there.  It was great.  And they shut the door on me.  They wouldn't let me up the elevator.  I had to take like an old stairwell.  That's not true.  That's not true.  Yeah, shut the door.  Who's that wanker? 
[01:39:00]  Never.  Sharon's the funniest and the best, man.  She's awesome.  Nobody fucks around with her backstage, though.  The first time I met you was yours.  You probably don't remember.  It was just a quick hello.  It was backstage.  Take probably out of that.  She doesn't remember.  She doesn't remember.  Remember we smiled and took a picture?  But it was like, when you walk down the hallway, everybody just shuts the...  Nobody wants to say the wrong thing.  And moved out of the way, right?  Really?  It was great to watch.  You kind of have a reputation, Sharon.  Not at all.  Can I stand up for Sharon for one minute?  Sure.  I'm just telling you this, and this is the truth.  Because I've known her for years, she is beyond funny. 
[01:39:30]  Beyond...  I'm not kidding you.  You don't have to sell anyone on that after the TV shows and stuff.  You're just saying it.  We...  I tell you what, though.  We have had so much fun together over these last few weeks.  And days.  Are we allowed to mention what you guys are doing yet?  Or is it still top secret?  You know no one's going to figure it out.  It's the worst secret ever.  Everyone is figuring it out.  Tell me about it.  But that's the rule.  They have a couple people come in from the network and beat you around the ribs. 
[01:40:00]  I'm like, I just mentioned the...  I have a feeling you guys are doing very well on this show.  But I know you can't comment, but...  Unless Donald Trump is like, you know...  Oh, Jesus.  Sending the people around that...  Oh, I shouldn't even mention Donald Trump.  All right, I'll shut up.  I'll shut up.  We're treading water.  I'll shut up.  I'll shut up.  We're always treading water, though.  Me and her heads are always...  Can we say the chopping block if there was to be something we were doing? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  If there was a show, let's just say, that we might be doing...  Yeah.  All right.  We guys are always on a chopping block.  Excellent legal coverage there, Brett.  That was excellent.  Excellent way to...  Wow, you're a sly one.  Let me read something from this affidavit.  Well, we can ask Sharon about Raw.  Yeah, I was just talking to you last night, Sharon.  Oh, God.  We had such a blast last night.  It was unbelievable.  I was busy oiling up all the wrestlers and...  Oiling them up, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Working them out before they went in the ring. 
[01:41:00]  Hello.  It was fantastic.  Does it drive you nuts?  This drives me nuts, too, when fans complain.  Like, why would Ozzy do that?  Like, they complain about certain...  Like, certain things are okay and acceptable for a guy in metal to do.  I'm sure you get it, too, because you're doing a television show.  And other things are like, if you go beyond what metal is, what they see it is,  you're selling out.  And it drives me nuts that they don't want you to do other stuff.  I never can work it out because so many of the fans are like,  Oh, man, that's not credible.  That's not cool.  It's like, hey, get a life.  You know, if you try and be cool all the time and think, 
[01:41:30]  Oh, it's not good for my fan base.  This isn't cool for me to be doing this.  It's like, you either are good or you're bad at what you do.  So, you know, you carry on and you live your life.  In between, you can be a dick.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Occasionally.  Occasionally.  You can't be thinking, oh, this isn't cool to do this, or I can't do that advert because...  It's like, oh, please, give me a break.  You know, what are you going to do if somebody offers you a fat check to advertise something? 
[01:42:00]  No, not going to do that.  No, you keep the bunny.  No, I'm not doing that.  Sorry.  It's like, get a life.  I'm sure you guys saw...  I say, wait, how big is that check?  Put my pecker in what?  You got it.  Exactly.  It's different about Sharon and Ozzy.  They had credibility.  I had no credibility from the beginning.  So, dude, I could...  And after Rock of Love, if there was even an iota of musical credibility,  love, sticking my tongue in places that God knows no one should put it.  After that, it was done.  With that said, is there anything you wouldn't do for the big fat paycheck? 
[01:42:30]  Sure.  Or something you said no to, and you know the money was amazing?  Nothing I can think of.  Listen, there is so much stuff that we can ask to do, and you just go, oh, no, I just  can't.  I can't do it.  Think of the money.  I can't.  Yeah, really?  So she calls me.  Brett, listen.  I've got a deal for you.  And for 98% plus an 85-15 overage.  I've got a deal for you.  Brett, listen, Ozzy really wanted to do this, but he can't make it. 
[01:43:00]  Yes, he has integrity.  Are you available?  Brett's there going, a finder's fee?  I need more than a finder's fee.  85-15 split.  Now, I'm a fan of Sharon's because of America's Got Talent.  That's where I'm at with Sharon Osbourne.  Yeah, that took off.  I watched every episode, man.  That was great.  It's fun.  It's a great show to work on.  And Hasselhoff is out of his freaking mind.  Oh, he's fabulously insane.  I mean, just everything that comes out of his mouth is another little gem. 
[01:43:30]  And you go, where did that come from?  I watch it.  It's incredible.  He is so funny.  You think he couldn't top the hamburger on the floor moment?  Well, he was in the news recently with his drink.  And what the heck was the latest story?  Recently?  Yeah, recently.  Crazy?  I don't remember now.  Oh, great.  Just throw it out there without backing up.  I'm going to tell you a Hasselhoff story.  This one, I wish, involved Ozzy and me as well.  But it was just me. 
[01:44:00]  We're over with Aerosmith years ago doing, I think it was Mannheim or something like that.  We're playing in Germany.  And we're doing a huge music festival at a soccer stadium, right?  And I'm thinking, man, we just sold this place out in a couple weeks.  This is awesome.  We're breaking.  This is big.  David Hasselhoff, I'm not making this up, had like 18 nights sold out.  I couldn't make this up.  I was like, I go, wait, hold on a minute.  What are you talking about?  The Knight Rider guy?  Is that Hasselhoff?  No, it was insane.  It was like 18 stadium nights sold out in a row. 
[01:44:30]  Incredible.  He's huge over there.  I'm not making it up.  Just last week, I'm here in New York, and I'm sat in this car at a traffic light, and  David Hasselhoff walks past, and I'm like, David, it's Sharon.  David.  And he goes, hi, and keeps walking.  You work with the guy.  What the hell is going on?  I know.  He's like thinking, oh, if somebody wants my autograph, I'm like, David, it's Sharon.  Oh, bye. 
[01:45:00]  See ya.  Michael, it's Sharon.  Say hello.  I haven't watched Dancing with the Stars.  Is Kelly still on?  I mean, she's doing great.  Kelly's still on, yeah.  She's still on.  Yeah.  How many people are left?  Gosh, I don't know.  She's been on it seven weeks now.  Damn.  I know.  I know.  It's incredible.  That's pretty good to be on it that long, that's for sure.  She did great together.  Who did we know that got thrown out right away?  Liddell.  Liddell has been a few weeks.  I saw Chuck like right after that.  He's had a, he tipped a few back.  Oh, wow.  Actually, ah, yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Ashley Hamilton was the first one to go.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Liddell was hysterical when he attempted to smile and his face actually cracked like  granite.  It was hilarious.  It really was like watching Stonehenge try to be pleasant.  Because he's such a sweet guy, but his job is to beat the shit out of the ass.  Did you ever watch him in an interview when he's done with the fight?  Well, I was just thinking.  I was thinking about my kids.  Yeah, yeah.  His face, his nose is like over here.  And he's just pummeled some guy's face.  After doing that animal move on top of the fence, he's just, ah, and then, yeah. 
[01:46:00]  I had a good time out there.  I've got to respect my opponent.  You respect him.  He's dead.  You killed him.  He's now a cripple.  You respect him.  Exactly.  He's never going to walk again.  But listen, Liddell versus Stephen Hawking.  This wasn't what we had hoped for.  And Chuck is a close talker.  I saw him in L.A. recently.  He doesn't have this.  He talks like, no, because he doesn't.  He talks like literally his lips touch my ear a couple times.  But you don't say anything.  You're like, go ahead, alpha, mail me.  I'll just take it. 
[01:46:30]  Okay, what are you going to do?  That's what you do.  He doesn't have a fly-by zone.  He really does.  Because I have a heavy fly-by zone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  But I guess when you do that for a living, there's no personal space, you know, violation clause.  You guys are promoting, too.  I know you're here to promote something.  It's a 24-hour fitness.  The trainers are Brett and Maria from WWE, and Sharon is a personal motivation.  And it's a 24-hour fitness rock star boot camp workout.  It's on 225 Fifth Avenue, and there are classes today from 10 to 10.30, 11 to 11.30, and 12 to 12.30 p.m. 
[01:47:00]  All three classes are today only, and 225 Fifth.  Do you know what the cross street for that is?  26th and 27th.  Yeah.  And they can come, and all three of you are involved with all three classes.  All the classes.  And here's what's great about it is it's a great opportunity to come down and work.  It's the rock star workout, and I think the first time we may be making history.  Right, Sharon?  Oh, my goodness me.  We're going to teach everybody how to get a backstage pass through dance. 
[01:47:30]  Uh-oh.  This is all through dance.  All through dance.  None of what y'all be doing.  You're going to learn how to do air guitar.  You're going to learn how to do a drum solo.  The tour bus thrust.  Oh, yes, the tour bus thrust.  Some tells me.  The singer-winger.  Some tells me.  Brett knows how to give out backstage passes.  Oh, yeah, a VIP pass.  And dancing didn't have much to do to it, I'm sure.  No, we're going to be thrusting for half an hour.  Yes. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, it's going to be amazing.  We're going to teach you how to flash properly.  Yes.  There's the flash.  The flash.  Also, there's the hangover.  We teach you the hangover.  I know how this works within a...  Maria did an amazing job.  Maria Kanellis is the actual trainer, right?  She did an amazing job.  Sharon and I...  Sharon has personal motivation.  So she can walk around and say,  Get your fat work out there.  Move it.  I'm kicking everyone.  That's it.  Move it.  And I'm the worst DJ ever.  I think we got Maria on the phone, actually. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, I thought so, too.  Maria.  I'm here.  Hey, we got Sharon and Brett Michaels in studio.  How are you?  Hi, guys.  I'm good.  Hi, Maria.  All bubbly.  Yeah.  I'm at 24-hour fitness right now, just getting everything set up.  So I'm glad you guys are there, though.  Listen, Maria, we've been talking about your thrusts.  Yes, I have a very nice thrust.  Yes.  Oh, you want to see your thrust.  Beautiful thrust.  Yes.  It's an engulfing thrust. 
[01:49:00]  See, now this, to me...  It's all the white muscles.  This is very weird.  This sounds a lot better than that hamburger thing you were doing.  Yeah.  We didn't like the hamburger thing.  Believe me, it's a lot prettier.  The hamburger thing.  Yeah, it sounds hotter than the hamburger thing.  It's so weird that these three are just getting together for the hell of a minute.  Three friends just meeting up really straight.  It happens.  It happens all the time.  Maria, talk about the hangover.  Yeah, what's the hangover?  The hangover is the proper position in order to make your head hurt a whole lot less. 
[01:49:30]  And also, it teaches you how to get into the praying to the porcelain god position as well.  Yes.  Now, what about the backstage pass thing?  Is there a way for men to get backstage passes, too?  Because hot women have always gotten them.  But the hard part is for guys to get backstage passes.  Oh, yeah.  There's a way, isn't there, Maria?  Oh, yes, definitely.  If you complete the class, I will personally help Brett give you a backstage pass.  Brett, you want guys backstage with you? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, sure.  It depends.  It really depends on what they're wearing.  Exactly.  Are they smelt?  We're like a twink, don't we?  I'll make cologne.  Cologne is good.  Cologne is good.  God damn.  I always found the best way to get a backstage pass is stalk poor Ozzy until Sharon just  feels sorry for you.  And calls her in Los Angeles and says, all right, you fucking weirdo, come on.  I wonder how you get that, too.  Eventually, she figured out it's better just to meet you and go.  Yeah, they get the fucking FBI profilers there taking notes. 
[01:50:30]  You know what?  It's getting DNA off of you.  It's just a skin sample.  I think we have audio of Jimmy, intro, and Ozzy.  No, we don't.  No, we don't.  Oh, my God.  I think Sharon has to get it.  No, no, no.  Let's hear it.  Hold on for a second.  No, no, no.  I think we might.  I'm not sure if we've played this on the air yet.  No.  Come on.  Listen to this, Ozzy.  What happened was, when I was in Los Angeles, and I'm going to talk real slow, I would be 
[01:51:00]  happier right now if they said, here's footage of Jim blowing a few people.  I would feel less embarrassed.  All right.  All right.  So then we've got that, too.  Sharon, there was an excitement factor when Jimmy introed your husband.  When Sharon knew, she was being very sweet.  She's like, do you want to bring Ozzy on?  And I'm like, you know, I'm into Jimmy.  I mean, you're the last person I have to tell of what a huge fan of Ozzy Jimmy is.  And do you know how you say all cool?  Like, sometimes you don't have to be cool.  Like, you just be yourself.  But there's a line between don't try to be cool and be a fucking 41-year-old slash teenage 
[01:51:30]  girl.  I really should have had on falsies.  What a fucking embarrassment I am.  Why don't we let Sharon and Bret Michaels hear this?  Sharon's already there.  Bret's busy.  No, Bret.  They've got to promote an event.  Bret, you want to hear this, right?  I can just keep talking.  Bring it.  I'm ready.  There's no need for it, because I'm just...  Come on, let's hear it.  Here it is.  This is not it.  Are you ready?  Come on, you motherfuckers.  It's been a very long, my concert.  Are you ready? 
[01:52:00]  No, I thought they were confused.  Let me hear you, my son.  I'm a thief.  I'm a thief.  Jimmy didn't want the audience confused.  It's not a Barry Manilow.  You see me looking at my ticket.  Hold on.  What the hell?  I want a Barry Manilow.  I thought he did bark at the moon.  That was simply for clarity. 
[01:52:30]  That's all it was.  I couldn't...  I just came out.  Sometimes you say something on Sunset Strip, and you can't take it back.  Yeah, but I...  Was that near Tower Records by any chance?  It was actually farther down from Tower Records.  It was by the Key Club.  Key Club.  That's the Key Club.  Okay, got it.  Sunset was all, you know, cordoned off, and everybody was performing in the street.  It was unbelievable.  Then Simon Cowell calls me the next day, and he lives in Beverly Hills, and he goes,  I was sat in my garden, and I heard this motherfucker introducing... 
[01:53:00]  I'm sat outside by my fire pit with my girl drinking wine, and I'm getting down to it,  and suddenly I hear this motherfucker introducing Aussie Bucket Osborne.  I'm like, I'm sorry, Simon.  Oh, I'm so happy.  That makes it worth it.  You know why he's a Barry Manilow fan.  I'm so happy. 
[01:53:30]  He got his hopes up.  Oh, goody.  That's so great.  That's your turn being around on that.  It's like your braces a crowd, like the words Aussie.  You motherfuckers.  Oh, I'm so happy.  Oh, that's a good one.  He's there doing his, you know, big stud thing.  He's got the fire pit going, the wine, and he's just getting down to it.  Make that move, and then...  Just so fucking happy to be there, weasel, screaming into a microphone that I was.  What a fucking worm.  Goddamn, that's fine.  I can't tell you how happy that makes me. 
[01:54:00]  Now it's good.  Jesus, I ruined the night of a mogul.  Brett enjoyed that.  Yes.  How's your nose, by the way?  It broke up pretty good, but much better now.  Are you sick of seeing that footage?  You never can get sick of me smashing my head into an 800-pound wall.  That's classic.  Thank God, again, with the internet, it just doesn't last very long.  No, no.  That clip will be gone in no time.  People forget.  You know what the good thing is?  There's a seven-second delay.  They'll never show this on TV, so I'm set. 
[01:54:30]  They'll put my nose back in.  Liza Minnelli will hand me a towel, as she always does after a show.  You know, and I will never forget the last words.  Elton John's getting yanked back.  The word the week before, I said, we should never do, poison, nor I should ever do an  award show.  We suck at them.  We fight.  I mean, CeCe fought each other on stage.  Who does that?  I mean, it's an award show.  It's an award show.  We're like, I hate your, what the.  So we get, we walk out, and they say, all you got to do is wave and walk backwards, right,  at the Tonys.  I'm like, all right.  And they say, never turn your back on the crowd. 
[01:55:00]  That's the whole thing.  I go, I have a quick question.  I'm at the front of the stage.  How do I know when it ended?  Like, how do I know when, like, do I just walk backwards until I'm out of sight?  What do I do?  And I turned around and headed backwards.  And as I said, you rock, good night.  The next thing I know, my feet were above my head.  I was wearing a cowboy hat as a sombrero around my wiener.  And it was just, I mean, it was the most embarrassing.  But I was so knocked out.  It's like innocently getting hit crossing the street.  There was no rhyme or reason to what happened.  You must have been like, what the fuck just happened to me? 
[01:55:30]  I looked up, and the thing, they were trying to finish me off.  The thing keeps coming down.  I look up, and I see this.  I wish I could make this part up.  I'm going to tone it down.  There's monkey-like creatures, like, because there's some kind of offshoot of the eyes.  There's Shrek.  No one says, are you okay?  You know what they said?  Move out of the way.  We've got to go up next.  I'm like, I just, my face, can I get my nose back from the other side of the stage?  Unbelievable.  Sharon, there's no words to describe the, I was too beat up to be embarrassed. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, we saw it.  Yeah, we all saw it.  We saw it in slow motion.  Oh, yeah.  Freeze frame, rewind.  It was really slow.  I'm sure, out of the 22 million hits on YouTube, I sure no one saw it.  That would be fine.  This rocker gets rocked in this next clip.  Oh, does he?  What is it?  Oh, hey, Brad.  Hey, that's great.  And then everyone who made fun of me, it's like, dude, I was really, I felt for you.  I'm like, that didn't sound like it on the radio.  You're like, look at this idiot.  His feet are above his head.  They freeze frame it.  My feet are like this. 
[01:56:30]  And that's it.  Let's move on.  You knocking yourself out made my intro of Ozzy look like fucking Martin Luther King speech.  Maria, you're feeling left out.  No, we love Maria.  No, not at all.  But I do wish I was there.  They are wonderful.  They made me laugh for the first time.  I think in probably two weeks.  Hallelujah.  Maria, let me tell you, they wish you were here, too.  Give us a shameless promotion, Maria.  What are we doing today, Maria?  Yeah, let's hit this hard now. 
[01:57:00]  Well, today we are doing a rock star boot camp.  And we're going to play a little air guitar and some air drums.  There's going to be definitely signing your seat.  Hopefully it's a good one.  There's going to be the hangover.  And it's all going to be mixed up with a little bit of kickboxing, which is definitely during the punk rock concert.  So it's definitely a rock star.  And what happened to the flashing?  Flashing's in.  Mosh pit.  Oh, yeah.  Mosh pit.  Yep.  We've got the lighter.  We've got the rock ballad, which is stretching. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  The rock ballad mixed with the lighter.  Hey, I got bad seats.  I got bad seats.  You know what?  No more lighters, though.  Your boy has his soft stuff.  That's right.  It's all about lifting your cell phone up now.  No more lighters.  Yeah.  Cell phone.  It's all about lifting that cell phone up.  Yes.  Yeah.  So let's just say, obviously, the three of you have just been getting together for just to be silly.  For no reason.  Plus for fun.  So you're still in.  Shits and giggles.  It happens.  We do it every day.  We get nothing accomplished.  Yeah.  So it's basically you're all enjoying each other's company and hanging out and whatever. 
[01:58:00]  Absolutely.  You're all getting along well.  Yeah.  We love each other.  Absolutely.  I'm here for no other reason.  Yeah.  Same team.  24-hour fitness rock star boot camp.  Boot Camp Workout.  Yeah.  That's right.  225 5th Avenue.  That's 26th or 25th and 5th?  26.  Between 26th and 27th.  And 27th on 5th Avenue.  There's three classes today.  From 10 to 10.30.  11 to 11.30.  And then noon to 12.30.  So they're easy.  You're in and out in a half hour. 
[01:58:30]  And you get to be a part of something.  Yeah.  Did Ozzy come to New York with you, Sharon?  Yeah.  Ozzy's here.  Is he sleeping?  Yeah.  He is.  I know.  I hate when that happens.  I'm like leaving the room at 7 this morning and he's like snoring up a storm.  I'm like, you bastard.  Lucky Ozzy.  Lucky Ozzy, man.  I'd love to be sleeping.  He doesn't need to see my face again.  Give him a break for a few months.  Poor guy just wants to relax and enjoy his family. 
[01:59:00]  And I fucking...  It's Ozzy's face on the side of the stage while you're doing...  What the hell?  Ozzy has nightmares that he takes the tin off the room service thing and it's my face smiling  up at him.  Hi.  It's me again.  He is Ozzy's biggest fan.  There's no one there.  I know you've met him all over the years, but Jimmy's the biggest.  By far.  It was weird.  It was like this last time of doing the tribute and then it was the first time I met him  where I didn't want a picture.  It was like, you know, it's like...  You know, he gave Ozzy the best gift.  It was a picture of him and Ozzy backstage and it was a picture with your girlfriend, 
[01:59:30]  but he took his girlfriend out and superimposed Susan Boyle.  And you're in that picture too.  It's us.  Susan Boyle.  That's actually on the...  I wish Danny could get up a screencast.  This great picture of Susan Boyle smiling, looking like a slapped ass right next to Ozzy.  A slapped ass.  Yeah, that really is a great shot.  What a great line. 
[02:00:00]  That's a great line.  Oh, man.  Do you love Susan Boyle?  I mean, do you feel like she helped the show or not?  Or do you not love her?  Are you happy that she's succeeding?  Oh, I'm happy that she...  I like everybody to do well.  Yeah.  Even someone that looks like a slapped ass with a mustache.  It's like, God bless her.  What's that?  You go, girl.  She does look like a hairy arsehole.  I don't know why they try to clean her up.  I mean...  No.  Keep her how she was.  Wow. 
[02:00:30]  That's fantastic.  It's kind of hard to spin that.  What did you mean when you said she was a hairy asshole face?  Well, it was a spiritual comment.  I didn't mean it to be taken in a bad way.  No.  And she is a lovely...  I would hope so.  Followed by God bless her heart.  God bless her.  No, you don't.  You just want to say, God bless.  And here's a Gillette razor.  I never noticed that she had facial hair.  Oh, my God.  She's fuzzy.  I can't quite get past the slut.  I couldn't get past the fucking Gene Wilder wig. 
[02:01:00]  God bless her heart.  God bless her.  But we love her.  All that talent doesn't come without a price.  Wow.  God doesn't give everyone everything.  Absolutely.  Yeah, absolutely.  But he gave her the talent.  He certainly did.  Yes, he did.  Really shortchanged on the rest of it.  He hit her with the fucking ugly stick.  He certainly did.  Holy Jesus. 
[02:01:30]  Why are you holding back?  I don't know.  Seriously, Sharon, I need you to open up.  Yeah, you've got to open up a little bit.  He gave Tiger Wood the ugly stick.  Could you knock this bitch around for a few hours?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  It's not going to get better than that.  Wow, that is very refreshing.  Oh, absolutely.  That's funny to hear.  I thought I'd pound with a plug.  Yeah, Maria, we're going to let you go.  You missed all the fun once again.  Yeah.  You're scared.  I think at this point you're scared of us. 
[02:02:00]  Maria, I'm coming down to go to that routine with you again.  Remember, tour, bus, thrust.  Bus, thrust.  On the ones.  My friend was on a tour bus, actually, with Brent, Jim Florentine.  He said that you're the naive.  He said, Brent is nice to everybody.  You just have that way.  Don't tell.  You guys are killing my reputation.  I'm being nice to everybody.  Get off.  Yeah, get out of here.  Terce, would you guys like a beer?  Are you done with me?  What did he tell me?  Would you please get the fuck off my bus?  I don't think it's if we're coming, you fucking sidewinder. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, fucking sidewinder.  How many t-shirts would you buy?  That's it.  Get off my bus.  Hey, Florentine, you want to get laid?  There's an ass-faced girl back in.  Yeah, go fuck that one that looks like.  Swap dogs.  Yeah, go fuck Rocky Dennis in the back if you're not busy.  Fucking.  Talk back to those.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, he just said that Brent had a very cool technique of coming out and chit-chatting  and then disappearing in the back with a new friend.  Well, you never know.  And he just had this amazingly magical way of doing it. 
[02:03:00]  I would just go to the back of the bus and tell her to push back there for like 10 minutes.  Make it look good.  Make it look good.  Shake the beers around.  All right.  All right.  We had a good time.  We had a good time.  Remember, you know what we did.  Are you done with Rock of Love?  Well, for now.  Yes.  For now?  If not, we're taking it international.  I have trouble communicating in American.  In American.  In English.  We're the smart man.  I'm not there for the smarts.  Rock of Love, Zaire. 
[02:03:30]  That's the way to go with that.  No, Rock of Love, Iraq.  Get Belgium.  Rock of Love, get Belgium.  First prize is you get to marry Brett.  Second prize is they remove your clitoris.  That's Iraq, sorry.  It's an ugly culture.  Hey, I didn't create this culture.  Exactly.  Now, where's my prongs?  So, today they think stoning one of his dates.  Instead of mud football this year, we're going to beat you in the face with rocks.  If you love me, and you care about me, you'll take this face beating. 
[02:04:00]  It might hurt, but you'll win the Susan Boyle look-alike concert.  Wow.  Holy shit.  This isn't a Susan Boyle concert, you motherfucker!  I should be shot in the face with a shit gun.  I suck.  Get one of the riggers to get a shit gun and bring it out of your meal.  Holy shit.  God, am I valueless. 
[02:04:30]  My stomach is hurting.  An amazing half hour.  You're sweating profusely.  This is a good laugh.  Hey, are you still with Taya?  God, dude.  Or do you throw her back?  No, no.  I never throw them back.  You never throw them back?  Yeah, we're friends with benefits.  All right.  Nice, man.  Yes.  Really?  You never throw them back?  You always keep them in the pond?  Always in the pond.  Always keep them.  It's like those trout ponds you take your kids to.  Yeah, yeah.  It's catch and release.  Yes, catch and release.  Catch and release.  Well, we do eat some of them, though.  Great.  With these girls, do you just stoop them on the bus? 
[02:05:00]  You never take them out.  You never buy them a meal.  You just stoop them and leave them.  Do you ever see the budget for Rock of Love taking them out?  If we get a stoop, we're lucky to get money for a football.  You get cool food.  I have to go get my kids football.  Stooping is just bust strictly.  It's a bust stooping.  Yeah, quick stoop.  Keep it on the low budget.  Listen, girls, I don't know why I didn't get you any year.  I want to stoop you in the bus.  I'm never going to mention your name.  We'll never do anything outside of the bus.  And you're not even getting a dinner.  Conversation limited. 
[02:05:30]  And you'll still get laid.  And in the end, you win nothing, by the way.  Nothing.  You win nothing.  Nothing except a dose.  They end up with an itchy fanny.  I've been itching profusely since I've been on the road.  That's hilarious.  I'm going to tell you something.  Honestly, the girls make that show, though.  They are the rock stars on that show because it is insanity. 
[02:06:00]  I would never do another TV show.  But today, please come down because Sharon and Maria and I are hanging out.  Oh, of course.  But it's not.  They are the stars, man.  Just hanging.  It's obviously going to be a fucking fun hang, man.  24-hour fitness.  We'll give it a couple of plugs.  Go on.  225 Fifth Avenue.  That's 5th between 26th and 27th.  Maria is down there.  And, of course, Sharon will be there.  And so will Brett.  Between 10 and 10.30.  There's one class.  11 to 11.30 is the next.  Noon to 12.30.  There are three half-hour classes. 
[02:06:30]  And, you know, you just go ahead and take one, right?  You don't take all three.  You just take one less.  Hey, we'd love you to stay and do it.  Yeah, we'll do it.  You're coming down, right?  Yeah, I will come down.  I have a meeting with a publicist after because we had to get a new one.  Because, you know, I'm managing to take all my TV stuff and parlay it into absolutely nothing.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  I fucking parlayed Leno appearances into a podcast.  I truly am a fucking boom.  Are you not doing Leno anymore?  Oh, I still am, yeah.  But, I mean, I'm hanging on by a thread.  So, see.  Oh, shit. 
[02:07:00]  What?  God, dude.  You know what?  What do you think?  We don't hang in and dealing with Ozzy for all those years.  What do you think?  We don't see this Sharon on America's Got Talent.  She's nice to everybody and sweet and motherly.  You've got to tell it like it is on America's Got Talent.  When you see the show we're not doing, it is.  When you see Sharon and you see what happened to the show we're not doing yesterday, I've 
[02:07:30]  never cried and laughed so hard.  I'm not kidding you.  Like, I was at one point holding my gut busting and then I heard a sound.  Hey, you motherfuckers!  We're out on sunset.  Can you keep it down?  Yeah, fuck.  That's how you deal with Ozzy for all the time.  It's crazy that you've got to be funny because he's a funny dude.  A lot of people don't know how he's a funny guy.  Hey, I'm not just saying that because I love him.  He's a funny person.  No, he was doing the...  Should we tell the story, Brad?  Oh, no. 
[02:08:00]  Not the George Burns oriented?  Not that story?  No, no, no, no, no.  The Jeff Bech.  Oh, please tell it.  No one...  Please...  You've got to...  America needs to hear this.  We should end with this one.  Let's end with that.  Please.  Ozzy was doing the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame show on Friday at the Gardens.  And he says, oh, you know, all these musos were there.  I'm asking him what's going on because I was working at the time.  And he's telling me and he goes, and Jeff Bech's up there playing.  He goes, and he's playing and playing. 
[02:08:30]  And I'm like saying to myself, where's the fucking singer, man?  And he goes, can you play something we all know?  Where's the hook?  Can you play something we all fucking know?  Where's the hook?  Where's the fucking singer?  And you know, Jeff Bech, we were laughing because we were talking about it.  I grew up playing Wired.  Yeah.  But it does have a jam.  It's a bit of fusion going on, you know?  Can you play something we all know?  Oh, fucking God. 
[02:09:00]  He goes to me, he comes in here, he goes, he's got this young, gorgeous chick.  It's his fucking bass player he's got with him.  So I thought it was his daughter.  Oh, God.  I never got into Jeff Bech.  No, it goes over your head.  What's your new shirt?  Where's the fucking singer?  Where's the singer?  Where's the fucking singer?  That is classic.  He goes, and then they had Ray Davis there because I thought he had fucking rigor mortis. 
[02:09:30]  What a sweater.  Oh, God damn classic.  Jack's the one guy in the family I haven't met yet where he's always like, every time I see you, he's around the world doing something and he's doing a big Aussie documentary.  Yeah, he's in Australia right now doing a show in Australia.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So he's still doing that.  Is he still doing that documentary?  He's doing the documentary on Aussie, yeah.  But he does his own show, which is called Adrenaline Junkie, which is extreme sports. 
[02:10:00]  It's a good show.  Wow.  Really good show.  You should check it out.  The whole family just, except the whole family.  Kelly's on Dancing with the Stars.  He's doing a show.  And Amy just kind of just hangs outside.  She likes to just kind of be low key and not be with a limelight.  She, she's still trying to change her name.  It's a smarge boy.  How do I change a few extra letters?  Is Amy Manson available?  I'll take Dahmer.  Whatever you want. 
[02:10:30]  Do you name me Dahmer?  Is Dahmer available?  Holy shit.  What a great hour.  Simpson.  Amy Simpson.  Anything.  Anything.  So it's, it's one of those things where it's like, she just kind of likes just kind of  being, uh, look, I spent, look, I spent 30 years trying to get on that show.  And all I was going to do was take my, drop my pants in Times Square.  We hate that guy.  We fucking hate him.  Why?  Tell me.  What happened?  Just because he's a hack.  He's in Times Square every day like that. 
[02:11:00]  Just, uh, playing, you know, a couple of notes.  He's a panhandler with a gimmick.  Yeah.  He took his fucking clothes off.  All right.  He does some crunches.  And honestly, you can't look at him.  You can't look at him.  Hey, listen, 24-hour fitness.  Damn.  And you have to admit, no matter how straight you are, there is a weird homosexual feeling  you get when you see him strumming that guitar and those goddamn quad muscles.  I keep looking for his skin marks and his undies.  He's always had the same length of my undies on. 
[02:11:30]  Not that I was looking, but he had one one day.  Did he?  I seen it.  Yes.  Oh, get out of here.  I was trying to throw him under the bus and nothing left.  I didn't stop the line.  Yes.  Well, one more shameless plug and we'll leave.  You can get rid of me.  You guys are busy today, so we're going to get out.  Oh, yeah.  We're busy.  We go to work out.  We're trying to avoid going over there if you notice.  Yeah, no shit.  For the show, we're not doing it.  Do you have other press today or no?  No.  Okay.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yeah.  Shall we go, Sharon?  Yes, my God.  Let's get out.  We've wasted enough time.  We have to go and work out.  Work out. 
[02:12:00]  Maria, thank you.  I'll see you guys when you get over here.  Thank you, guys.  All right, Maria.  Big kiss.  Come in and see us.  We don't bite, Maria.  Come on.  Next time, baby.  All right.  There goes Maria from the WWE.  She's actually working right now.  Yeah.  She's the only one that is.  We're just fooling around.  She's motivated.  Do you guys have another place we can go to and talk?  There's shows all around here.  Just look in a window, open the door, and pop in.  Say hi.  Listen, hello.  Bye again.  You guys probably, you really should just stop into a show and knock on the window and walk  in.  What else are they doing? 
[02:12:30]  Excuse me.  What are they doing better than that?  Nothing.  Let's talk about Susan Boyle's fanny.  That's got to be a horror show.  Susan Boyle's ass.  Fanny face.  Well, in England, it means something.  The fanny, you know, means the veg.  It's a diplomat, not the heiny.  Thanks for having us in.  Hold on.  I'm not done with Susan Boyle's veg.  I want to talk about that for a good half hour.  Looks like a juniper push.  All right.  Sharon's putting her coat on.  Brett Michaels is getting up.  Yeah, we want to thank these guys for stopping by.  It was great. 
[02:13:00]  Absolutely, man.  Thank you so much.  24-hour fitness, 225 5th Avenue, class at 10 to 10.30, 11, 11.30, noon to 12.30  with Sharon and Brett and Maria.  There you go.  We'll take a break.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  We'll continue.  Open Anthony and Jim Norton.  Holy shit.  Haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  Sharon Osbourne rules.  Out of her mind.  Brett Michaels was good, too.  Don't get me wrong, but fucking Sharon went off on everybody.  What a just-  Everybody. 
[02:13:30]  Nasty, quick witch she is.  We were just talking about how she's at a point-  She's probably always been there.  She's just-  She's not worried about being phony and offending people.  She's just funny and talking shit.  She's got two gears, too, because I watch America's Got Talent, like I said, a couple times.  And she's very motherly.  She cares about everybody.  She doesn't want to make anyone feel bad on stage.  She doesn't go after them whatsoever.  Like, it's up to the old British guy to do that.  Right.  Or the older-  Well, he's not even that old.  Whatever. 
[02:14:00]  He's like the Simon Cowell of the show.  She takes a different role there.  But obviously, we saw today that she could be fucking vicious.  She's fierce.  And she's not-  Here's what I like about her.  She's not a bully.  She doesn't fucking bully-  It's almost like-  Nice picture.  That's a nice photo of you and Bret and her.  It's actually a nice picture.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's not a bully, man.  She's been dealing with rock stars for fucking 30 years.  Fucking funny.  I wonder why she didn't get her career going sooner.  Obviously, she had Ozzy, and she was raising a family.  But wow, we missed out on a lot of good Sharon Osbourne years. 
[02:14:30]  Well, she was his manager.  I mean, she would probably do stuff with him as his manager.  But I mean, you always knew her as, yeah, the manager and Ozzy's wife.  And then obviously, the show put her on the map, and she's been hot ever since.  Yep.  Fucking hot ever since.  Yeah, she's on more shows than he is, man.  She's on television all the fucking time.  Yeah.  All right.  Just saw Jody Sweeten on-  Oh, I know.  The Channel 11 news there.  With her big jugs.  She has some giant jugs. 
[02:15:00]  I'm calling them jugs today.  Big jugs.  That's what I tweeted, too.  Did you?  I forgot what he said.  Something about you.  Did you put her here?  Is Jody Sweeten and her giant jugs?  Let me read exactly what I wrote.  On my Twitter, Opie Radio, of course.  Oh, there it is.  Everybody knows.  Opie's eye.  Jody Sweeten from Full House.  Nice jugs.  And then there's the picture.  God damn.  I got a picture of her jugs.  There's seven comments so far.  Let me read some of the comments.  This is that- 
[02:15:30]  Wait.  There is no way that jacket will zip her up to the top.  Poor little jacket.  Good thing I wasn't in studio.  My perv switch just flipped and I don't care.  Someone just went and went, I need those tits!  Amu?  What is that?  I have no idea.  What?  A boar?  Want.  Thank you for posting, Opie.  Damn, she is much hotter than I thought.  I want Ninny.  Linger longer. 
[02:16:00]  Remember that guy?  He wants Ninny.  He said, wow, those are giant jugs.  They're so giant, you would spend too much time on her boobs and wreck it all.  You would just ruin it.  Yeah, yeah.  You would just ruin it.  Have you ever had one of those, Jimmy?  Holy shit.  Do you know-  Well, you just suck-  You suck one tit and she's like, all right, there's a person attached to this thing.  You just ruin everything.  All right, you creep.  Obviously, you weren't breastfed as a kid.  Oh, God.  There's more to me than my big, huge jugs. 
[02:16:30]  She knows-  Those are implants, obviously, right?  Did you see when-  Yeah.  She likes showing them off.  Most girls that have implants love showing them off.  Love pushing them forward and everything.  Well, did you see when you went to take her picture?  She goes-  She knows exactly what to do.  She posed.  Yes, she did.  She went into this little pose mode and it was just-  Holy mother of fuck.  Mother of fuck.  Mother of fuck.  What is coming out of the side of that?  That would be breast meat.  Lots of breast meat.  Ample tit meat coming out of her, um, the side.  Or jug meat.  I'm sorry.  Can I tell you something about this Jodie Sweetin? 
[02:17:00]  Oh, what?  What are you speculating about Jodie Sweetin?  I'm not speculating.  I'm not going to say that she's still on drugs or any of that shit.  But, I mean, it's kind of weird that she's writing a book and she's not even sober a year.  Well, you've got to hope for the best and hope that she continues her sobriety.  Down that road, sure.  But it is a little odd.  It's a little too soon.  Under a year of sobriety to start writing a book about it.  With another, uh, marriage gone bad.  What's going on?  God. 
[02:17:30]  That might be how she deals with it.  Yeah, you know.  Kind of exercise those demons.  I'm not going to, uh, I'm not going to say anything bad about her.  No, she was great.  Hopefully she'll come back.  She looks so much better than the web pictures of her.  Like, there's a few web pictures where she looks really good.  But she looked, like, really, really nice in here.  Yeah, absolutely.  What a day.  I was all, you could tell when she came in, I was all like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got that, that cute girls in the studio voice.  Hi, how you doing?  I'm just a fucking ass. 
[02:18:00]  I wanted to ask questions, but you were on a roll.  I didn't want to interrupt.  I can't stop.  Yeah, that's what it is.  I'm like, I just talk too much.  It was cute.  Ugh.  I'm usually, you know, I usually can do okay if they've had a few drinks in them, but  what are you going to do with someone like that?  She smelled good.  She was sober.  Yes, she did.  Oh, shit, it was fucking good, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, like bubblegum and homework.  Oh, you got that.  What?  What else is going on?  So we did Election Day.  We did the fucking World Series shit.  There's a big uh-oh out there for you Yankee fans. 
[02:18:30]  Uh-oh.  Well.  We'll have to wait and see.  That's tomorrow.  Lady Gaga becomes the first artist in history to have four straight singles from a debut album  hit number one.  Wow.  What are the four?  Anyone know?  Poker Face.  And then there was Paparazzi.  Dick and Pants.  Dick and Pants.  And I'm a guy.  Giant clit.  Jim's fave.  Lady Gaga.  Did you hear Cartman?  Cartman.  Jesus. 
[02:19:00]  Cartman.  Cartman.  I have Cartman.  Cartman.  Did you hear Cartman singing Poker Face?  No.  It's quick.  It's like a minute.  Man, man, man, man.  Man, man, man.  I want to hold them like they do in Texas, please.  A little gambling is fun when you're with me.  I love it.  Russian roulette is not the same without a gun.  And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun. 
[02:19:30]  But oh.  I'll get him hot.  Show him what I've got.  Oh.  Oh.  I'll get him hot.  Show him what I've got.  Can't read that.  Can't read that.  No, he can't read my.  Poker Face.  She's just alone.  No money.  Can't read that.  Can't read that.  No, he can't read my.  Poker Face. 
[02:20:00]  What the hell?  What the hell?  Pop, pop, pop, Poker Face.  Pop, pop, Poker Face.  Na, na, na, na.  Pop, pop, Pop, Poker Face.  Pop, pop, Poker Face.  Pop, pop, Poker Face.  Na, na, na, na.  Oh, taberu na.  There you go.  Hey, what's this Christopher Walken does?  What?  Performs Lady Gaga's Poker Face.  It's on YouTube.  Christopher Walken performs Lady Gaga's Poker Face.  I don't know.  Let's take a look at it.  I want to hold them like they do in Texas plays. 
[02:20:30]  Fold them.  Let them hit me.  Raise it, baby.  Stay with me.  I love it.  Luck and intuition play the cards with spades to start.  And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's in his heart.  Oh.  Oh, oh.  I'll get them hot. 
[02:21:00]  Show them what I've got.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, ee.  Oh.  Oh.  I'll get them hot.  Show them what I've got.  P-p-p-p-p-p-p.  Poker Face.  P-p-p-p-p-p.  P-p-p-p-p-p. 
[02:21:30]  How's that from?  Damn.  It looks like some whiny show.  Yeah, that was, uh...  It's from the BBC.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, let's see.  Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on BBC.  And that was Walken.  It wasn't an impersonation.  It wasn't Jay Moore?  No.  It's amazing who they get on British television.  They get every guest on these talk shows.  They get fucking Dustin Hoffman.  Guys that don't do American TV.  And they do things like that, too.  I know.  They do, like, off-the-wall shit they would never do on, like, uh...  What do you mean they don't do American TV?  Leno or Letterman or anything?  It's really rare.  Like, Graham Norton over there, who was on Comedy Central... 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  ...would get, like, Dustin Hoffman and De Niro.  They much more...  It's part of their press tour over there.  Whereas here, it's rare that you get, uh, them on talk shows.  Dustin Hoffman is almost never...  ...on a talk show.  And I saw him on Letterman and I realized...  Oh!  Oh, oh, crashing, smashing bore.  Yeah, brilliant actor, but a terrible interview.  They're all terrible interviews.  Pacino is okay.  He sat there and went, like, uh, uh, oh, I got a funny story, um, but...  And then he can't tell a story.  And he's looking up in the air? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, he cannot convey a story in entertaining fashion to the talk show host.  Horrid!  Horrendous.  All right, moving on.  Have a mingland.  Someone wants to plug your gig this weekend, Jimmy.  Oh, in Houston.  Thank you, buddy.  Oh, yeah, by the way...  It's Kevin in Houston.  You're playing improv this weekend?  Yes, but Thursday, Friday, Saturday, because my Leno was moved to next week, so...  Uh, I had Leno Thursday, but I'm not doing it this Thursday.  So Thursday, Friday, Saturday, I'll be in Houston.  Houston?  At the Houston Improv.  Planet Houston.  My, uh, triumphant return. 
[02:23:00]  To Houston?  To Houston.  Kneel before Zod.  I will, uh...  And I do a very funny thing, uh, at the end of every joke when I'm in Houston.  What do you do?  I, I mention the name of one of the, uh, the Astros.  Oh!  Which one?  Sometimes I'll yell Bagwell.  Other times I'll yell J.R. Richard.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Then I'll reference the Bad News Bears movie in the Astrodome.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:23:30]  The Astrodome.  And then sometimes I'll say, it's nice to be back in Houston.  We've got a problem.  And I'll pretend I didn't mean to say that.  Apollo 13.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  That is a good one.  Thank you.  Why don't we do this now?  The Family Christian Bookstore hardly sounds like a hotbed of criminal activity, but police  say that's where one employee was victimizing customers as a peeping Tom.  Uh-oh.  Pat, I spoke with the former landlord and the landlord's son.  They described Joseph Morrow as a deeply religious man, and they're shocked. 
[02:24:00]  That he allegedly put a hidden camera inside the restroom of this Christian bookstore.  Nice.  Nice toilet cam.  Right, Jimmy?  Poopy cams.  Who doesn't like a good toilet cam?  From your lips to God's ears.  Poopy cams.  Get to watch the duty fall out.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's a good one.  Toilet cams are always set up, though, because...  Toilet cams suck.  They are.  The person starts shitting...  What's wrong with you?  Starts shitting four feet above the toilet just to get the log in view.  No one shits like that. 
[02:24:30]  Everyone knows you've got to put those cams in the showers.  You've got the fucking toilets.  Toilet cam.  Toilet cam.  Oh, that's a good one.  Her asshole opens up and drops a log.  Is that in the toilet?  How did you get a cam?  Stupid toilet cam.  Get the fuck out of here.  Pulling her panties to the side and just pissing, like, squatting.  That's fake toilet cam, right, Danny?  I don't know.  It's too clean back there.  What girl pisses like that?  You've got to see it.  Pulling shit to the side.  If they don't have a dirty asshole, then it's fake toilet cam. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  You know, because...  That would be a little dirt.  A little dirt.  That sounds like an excellent autobiography title.  Fucking hate toilet cam.  They're awful.  I'm a filth bag and I hate them.  Fake.  I hate any fakeness.  What do you mean?  I don't like fake stuff.  Porn, dirt, dirt.  You know what's funny to say?  Porn has obviously changed over the years.  And I clicked on a porno yesterday that had, like, terrible porno music in it.  And it threw me for a loop because they just don't do that anymore. 
[02:25:30]  Like, good porno doesn't have, like, that corny music in it.  Yeah.  And it was, like, the shitty blues riff.  And I just started laughing.  Like, I had to turn it off and put something else on.  It's old school.  You went old school.  Yeah, but it's...  Yeah, now it's just fucking...  It's very recognizable.  And it was so obviously...  The music was very recognizable.  Very obviously dubbed as well.  Like, you could tell, like, you know, what was going on.  It wasn't them using their own voices.  Oh, really?  It was terrible.  Do you remember the bit?  I don't know if we have a copy of it because we don't have everything we ever did. 
[02:26:00]  But where we played the soundtrack to the porn and then we guessed what was going on in that particular...  Oh, that scene.  Yeah, I do remember that.  We would play the music and then we'd have to guess what the scene set up was.  Someone's, like, happy stuff.  And we said it was, like, a guy just fucking...  I kind of like that bit.  I don't know if it plays anymore.  Who knows?  Let's get back to the story.  Toilet cam.  The restroom of this Christian bookstore.  Simi Valley police say Morrow worked as a clerk at the family Christian bookstore and allegedly set up a video camera hidden behind boxes. 
[02:26:30]  Police say the recording shows him setting the camera up.  He was arrested for peeping with an electronic device.  Well, you know, it's the last place you would think, but you're supposed to try to adhere to a higher standard and, you know, be an example.  Why is it the last place you would think?  Wouldn't that be the most obvious place you would do something like that?  Yeah, yeah.  What, in the restroom at a fucking strip club?  Is that the place you'd expect it to be?  That's where you'd expect it to be.  That's so stupid.  Of course you're going to go for the innocent places.  Oh, damn, no. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, what, what, what?  Don't click that one.  What, more?  The one that's on.  The one that's on.  The one that's on.  Let me see.  You guys are going to click.  That's so very small.  Oh.  That's, come on.  Oh, yeah.  It's poopy's ready to come out.  That looks like it's from joyangels.com.  It's, uh, it looks like a volcano.  Can I ask the women out there, do you spread your butt cheeks like the picture we're looking at just to make sure everything stays nice and clean back there?  No.  No?  No.  No.  Why would a girl do that?  No.  They sit, they do it just like us.  Except when they pee-pee, it sounds like... 
[02:27:30]  And that goes...  How much does it suck we have to do another hour of radio after that amazing segment?  I just want to acknowledge it because we're all feeling it.  That's like a big out for a radio show.  That was...  That's a good fucking night.  Sharon killing for a half hour, Bret Michaels killing, and then, then, fuck, we have to talk about toys.  Riddlecam shit.  That's right.  That's the way the show goes.  It ebbs and flows, you know.  I'm supposed to try to adhere to a higher standard and, you know, be an example. 
[02:28:00]  Now, Morrow was cited and released while police tried to figure out exactly what he was doing with those videos.  In the meantime, they're encouraging customers of the bookstore to get them a call.  What the fuck you think he was doing with those videos?  Post them on the web.  Playing them.  He was jerking off.  Oh, right.  What's this?  Jacking off?  Jacking off.  This fucking Kate is so doable now.  How the fuck did that happen?  No, that belly...  I'm telling you.  Dude.  No, you saw the bikini picture. 
[02:28:30]  She's on TV now, and the hair's growing out now, too, on top of it.  Oh, fudge.  Nerds to her.  Would you do Kate Gosling?  Jim Morton?  No, I let her suck my cock.  Oh, okay.  I think none of the babies came out of the vag, though, so that might be intact.  And, you know what?  It's not...  I'm not into motherhood, and I'm not knocking all you moms out there.  It's just not my thing.  The picture of her in the bathroom, of course not, Ann.  I'm talking about the interview they did last night, an exclusive interview.  I wouldn't...  No.  It's probably like Jimmy said. 
[02:29:00]  Right here.  Put my pee-pee in her mouth.  Here comes her face.  Look at that face, though.  She looks like a cunt, man.  She looks like a bitch.  You see that?  Look at that.  Stop.  You want that?  They didn't fix that.  She's got the old grandma hat on.  No, look at the...  Look at her bottom.  I can't argue that picture.  Look at her bottom.  Her ass isn't bad.  Dude, considering she pumped out eight babies, her ass is good for that.  Did she shit them out?  What the fuck?  I mean, like, it should be a frumpy, dumpy mess.  Yeah, the ass isn't really that bad, Ann.  No.  It's not that bad.  And I think the edge is behaving... 
[02:29:30]  It's melting.  That is a horrid ass.  I didn't say it was great.  I said it's not that bad.  There's a difference.  It's like a helium balloon after, like, three weeks.  When it starts following you around the house.  But I said not bad.  I didn't say fucking amazing.  It's terrible, but for a woman who had eight kids, it's excellent.  I mean, like, for a woman who had eight fucking children...  Oh, Greg, yeah.  But she bends over and it all tightens up nice for you.  I don't know you...  It's a good ass for a woman that had a shark bite on her ass.  It's a horrible ass.  I disagree.  You're not going to make, like, just because she had kids, it's a good ass. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, everything's relative.  Horrible ass.  Horrible.  Horrible.  I think that you're being...  Oh, it's horrible.  Belusa.  No.  Well, we got another dumb teacher.  We could go there.  We could play a little cleanup.  We got a lot of shit.  Did she make fucky fucky?  Oh, this teacher was just stupid.  Another dumb teacher.  Was she busted for having slaps?  Well, not really.  It's a sex thing, though.  Who the fuck is Warren? 
[02:30:30]  Hey, that was from yesterday.  Oh, Warren Haynes?  He was very good.  He was great.  Did you like him?  I loved him.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's not even my style of music, but I enjoyed his playing.  I put the...  I fucking YouTubed Warren Haynes all day yesterday because of that interview.  And I'm there talking, like, I don't know who he is from a fucking hole in the wall.  He does great song and everything.  And then I get a text from Patrick from the Dawn and Patrick camp.  Sure.  Saying that their son, my godson, Warren, is named after him. 
[02:31:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  No shit.  I had no clue.  I didn't know that either.  Patrick, apparently a fan.  No, Warren Haynes is the real deal.  Yeah.  He's the real deal.  He did a version of that song, Old Friend.  I'm going to put that up on my YouTube channel later today.  I felt quite the fool there.  They're probably lying.  He's probably named it to Warren Jerome.  Fucking Tweety from Bad Boys.  Tweety.  That was Tweety, you assholes.  Tweety, you assholes.  Oh, fucking loser good.  Oh, what's that?  That was the worst picture taken of her. 
[02:31:30]  Who's that?  That was yours?  Oh, Danny.  You didn't get her jugs.  Danny.  It still looks good.  It's all about the jugs.  There's nothing wrong with Jody Sweetin.  Yeah, but Danny had just a horrible picture.  I'll put a better one up with me and her if Eric ever sends it to me.  Yeah.  Eric knows to send me my goddamn pictures.  Lickety split.  Challenging observation, Randall.  Lickety split.  All right, let's get into this teacher in the Bronx in a bit of trouble.  Students call him Mr. V, a popular English teacher at the Bronx High School for Law and Finance.  Greg Van Voorhees, whose picture is posted on the school's website and on his own MySpace page. 
[02:32:00]  Greg Van Voorhees.  He's known for having a great relationship with his students, but parents say he took it too far when he allegedly passed this around class.  Sexually explicit literature telling stories of alternative masturbation involving objects like a carrot and worse.  Sources say the stories were...  How is it worse than a carrot?  Because everyone thinks carrot with the pointy end.  How is it worse than a carrot?  And worse.  Like, what... 
[02:32:30]  It makes a carrot seem crazy.  Maybe calories-wise.  Snickers bar.  Oh, okay.  A Kit Kat.  Well, that's worse.  Cactus.  All right, well, the big black fist would be a bit worse.  Danny's just pulled it, but a 15-inch tall, big black fist.  And if we stick with vegetables, I guess an eggplant would be worse.  Yeah.  An Oscar.  Fat end of a squarsh.  Yes.  A squarsh.  Heel end of a boot would be worse.  Let's name worse things to masturbate with for a woman.  A pineapple.  Much worse.  A whole pineapple.  Pruning shears. 
[02:33:00]  No, we're sticking with vegetables.  A vegetable.  Oh, Jesus.  And then we'll move on to other things.  Terry Schiavo.  A watermelon.  That's so dumb.  Grapes.  Pineapple.  That'd be hard with grapes, man.  I said pineapple.  Gregorio said pineapple.  That hurts.  That really hurts.  Yes.  It's a little pin cushion.  Plums on a knife.  Okay, that bit's over.  Of course.  Sources say the stories were downloaded from the internet and Van Voorhees passed them  around the class. 
[02:33:30]  Most of the stories are too explicit to show on television, but one part talks about sticking  stuff inside yourself.  Another passage reads, the rumor is you can have explosive hands-free orgasms.  At that age, this friend's a little sex maniac.  What is this guy thinking?  He's not.  Just like I am.  Apparently.  Yeah.  Checking off.  But he can't even say it was educational.  He has no argument here.  Hands-free is safe when you're driving.  Hands-free.  Because he said hands-free masturbation. 
[02:34:00]  That sort of material should not be distributed throughout the school.  The Department of Education confirms Van Voorhees is under investigation for distributing sexually  explicit and inappropriate material to students.  According to sources, Van Voorhees allegedly told the students it was a joke and they shouldn't  tell anybody he showed it to them.  Sources say he then collected the papers back from the students so they couldn't show anyone  else.  That's just a way to try to get cool with you so he can take a step further.  Tonight, Van Voorhees has been taken out of the classroom. 
[02:34:30]  He's been reassigned and we're told is no longer around students.  This is according to the Department of Education.  Reassigned.  Nowhere around students.  Reassigned.  They've got to try to figure out how they can fire him.  Where can we put Mr. V?  Mr. V.  If he's nowhere near students and he's been reassigned, where the fuck is he?  At school, right?  He can't even be a janitor.  Because that's around students.  Stoking the boiler in the basement.  All right, we're going to play, let's see.  We're playing cleanup. 
[02:35:00]  Let's play cleanup.  It's where all the DVDs and CDs, I mean, that are sitting in front of Opie, we go through  them and do a little house cleaning.  Flag band at an Albany apartment complex.  Mother of Boy Scout being very naughty.  Naughty, naughty.  I like naughty stories.  And I'm just going to pick a random one out of the pile here.  Uh, Kevin Jennings, Obama's safe schools are recorded in a speech saying public schools  are trying to recruit heterosexuals. 
[02:35:30]  What?  Whatever.  What?  Exactly.  What the fuck is that?  Why did Obama, like, decide that people with HIV could, like, come to our country?  Uh, because, Opie...  What's that about?  There's a stigma that is placed on people with, uh, AIDS and HIV that, um, really needs  to be, um, done away with.  And our country's ban on, uh, immigrants and people traveling and whatnot, uh, that have  AIDS, um, it's a terrible thing that makes it look really bad. 
[02:36:00]  Because he's a fucking liberal asshole.  Yeah, that is stupid.  You don't let diseased people like that into the country.  Because, again, uh, uh, footing the bill?  Who's going to foot the bill for their medical care?  Thank you, the American taxpayer.  And who's going to spread the shit around?  I have to agree with you.  Thank you.  Big time on this one.  It's stupid.  I mean...  It's a dumb fucking idea.  What, healthy people, uh, there's not enough healthy people that want to come to America  at this point?  Let's continue with the healthy people. 
[02:36:30]  Let's make this, uh, country strong.  Stop it already with a fucking liberal panty-waist, whiny crybaby.  He lifted the ban.  Save the world bullshit.  And it's not even cancer.  That's a weird one, man.  It's a fucking...  It's a spreadable plague.  Right.  Right.  A communicable disease that's ravaging Africa because they're fucking like crazy over there.  And they won't wear condoms.  They won't wear condoms.  So you want people like that to come over here and, uh, just start fucking and spreading AIDS.  It's not ravaging, uh, Africa.  Last time I looked, there was a lot of Africans. 
[02:37:00]  They do a lot of fucking.  They got a lot of Africans still down there.  A lot of fucking.  Or over there.  Where's Africa?  At least they got the cure over there.  Those geniuses over there have decided if they have sex with a virgin girl, uh, it takes  the AIDS away.  That's not a cure?  Uh, literal Jim.  A literal Jim, of course.  Uh, yeah, that's, that's brilliant.  But just what a dumb fucking thing to do.  Oh, he's an, uh, just an idiot.  All right.  Do you like the Albany apartment complex flag band? 
[02:37:30]  The mother?  Yes.  Of the boy scouts.  That one.  Yes.  You want to go there?  I do.  Yeah.  That really annoyed me.  All right.  Oh, flag band.  Oh, I don't want to hear that.  Oh, my.  Cool fucking K.  I thought I couldn't go in there.  I was very angry.  Yeah, I was protesting.  Then I realized, yes, an L.  Do you think Jodie Sweeten had a real problem or she was just getting started?  No, that was a real one. 
[02:38:00]  Uh, I really.  Why did you say that?  Her skin's still in good shape.  She looks really good for somebody that was doing that.  But, uh, she did some, like, drinking and, and probably woke up in some really bad situations.  But she started drinking.  Oh, but I'd love to hear one of, just one story where it was like, man.  We should ask her.  Wait, she's coming back.  On the rotisserie.  She's coming back.  When?  She says she's coming back to Sirius.  Yeah.  Let's get her in here one more time.  She's here at 1 p.m. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Who's sticking around for that shit?  I'm fucking, oh, yeah, I'm all over that.  Now to our top story.  I was told that I might be evicted if I didn't take the flag off of the car.  People living in the Oaks Apartments in Albany are baffled and enraged by a new flag ban  that's forcing them to remove their American flags.  We're told the ban includes sports flags, even flag stickers on cars.  Really unbelievable, I'll tell you, but it's case.  Wait, what is this?  Like, if you have a flag sticker on your car.  Oh, so it's not even the American flag? 
[02:39:00]  Now, why?  It's because, again, it's more liberal, panty-waste, fucking groveling, pandering garbage.  The ACLU, what is that?  The ACLU said that bar was a ban at...  Who did the ACLU fight for?  Did not violate any laws, but the legal council.  Wow, man.  They want to just turn us all into robots.  Who did the ACLU stick for?  We can't express shit anymore.  I know, I know.  They want us all to just be robots.  Did the ACLU stick up for the guys with the flags? 
[02:39:30]  The property manager decided she didn't have the legal standing to do so.  All right, they reversed it.  Good.  Why the fuck would they do that?  Let's get to the bottom of this.  Add stickers on cars.  No one's offended.  Really unbelievable, I'll tell you.  But as K2's Malika Johnson explains, it's the ban on the American flag that has residents absolutely fuming.  Here at the Oaks Apartments, the management can fly their own flag, advertising one- and two-bedroom apartments.  The residents here have been told they can't fly any flags, including this one. 
[02:40:00]  Jim Clawson flies the American flag from the back of his motorcycle.  He has a son in the military heading back to Iraq.  The flag is his way of showing support.  This flag stands for all those people.  It stands for the people that can no longer stand for this country who died in wars.  That's why I fly that flag.  But to Oaks' apartment management, Jim says, the American flag symbolizes problems.  He was told to remove the red, white, and blue from both of his rides or face eviction. 
[02:40:30]  It floored me.  I couldn't believe she was saying what she was saying.  Jesus.  Fucking cunt.  What a fucking...  You should be able to put the American flag anywhere you want.  I mean, again, in your office.  The fucking fact that they're afraid this will offend somebody, the flag of this...  It makes me fucking...  I know I bag on liberals, and I apologize.  I agree with you guys on a lot, and I wish I didn't.  I wish I don't... 
[02:41:00]  I shouldn't always bag on liberals.  But this is the type of shit that makes you fucking so hateable.  Can somebody explain this to me so I'm not going to be a dick and just bash liberals?  I don't want to do that.  Yeah, what's the meaning?  Where's the upside?  Yeah, please explain to me where the American flag is a problem.  Unless it's obstructing something.  Yeah.  But where it's offensive?  How is it offensive, ever?  Yeah, I know.  Why can't it be flown anywhere in the country? 
[02:41:30]  It's stupid fucking...  And the same people, by the way, that would say it's...  You should be able to say, no, don't put it there.  It's offensive.  It's offensive of the same people that would fight for your constitutional right to burn it.  Which I think you should be able to.  Um...  Jesus, how did I stop the whole show at that point?  I ruined everything.  We all look down to read something different.  No, I heard Jimmy.  I was going to give some guy the time of day. 
[02:42:00]  Fuck him.  Why?  Does he disagree?  Well, Guido goes, for two guys that support Obama, Opie and Jimmy,  it seems like more and more things that he does,  you're agreeing with Anthony and against Obama.  Get it now?  Oh.  And then he writes, get it now?  But I was pretty clear on why I went with Obama.  Um, I certainly didn't turn into a bedwetting liberal.  I certainly, uh...  Hey, man, I still sit here and say,  I don't want...  I didn't want fucking McCain.  No, he was too old.  I didn't want McCain.  Look, I'm not happy with what Obama's been doing lately. 
[02:42:30]  The Republican Party's fucked up.  I like McCain, too.  I just felt like I wanted a Democrat.  I didn't want McCain, and I still don't want fucking McCain.  I wanted a Democrat.  I don't like the...  My whole thing is real simple.  I don't like the system in general at this point in my life.  Gotta live with it, so...  I understand that.  That's why I said, today, when Anthony goes to vote...  That big lever, right?  That fucking lever, I am looking for the most...  I heard they installed the one big lever for you today.  Fascist fucking motherfuckers I could find.  I am going so far right. 
[02:43:00]  That's fascism.  It's crazy, because I realized something.  Socially, a lot of people say, well, socially, I'm liberal, but fiscally, I'm conservative,  which means, you know, you want your money, you don't want to tax, but socially, I don't  mind gay marriage and a woman's right for abortion and everything, and I thought about  it for the past couple of days, and I don't give a shit about anybody, so why the fuck 
[02:43:30]  do I care if a woman could get an abortion, or gay people could get married, or any of  that?  So I'm going completely fucking conservative.  Fuck everybody and their abortions and their fucking gay marriages.  I want less taxes.  I want to keep my guns.  I am going ultra fucking fascist.  That's what I'm voting.  If there's a swastika on it, I'm pulling the handle.  Nothing wrong with that.  I mean, look, everyone votes for their own interest.  That's what voting is.  It's like, gay people vote a certain way because they want what they want. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, exactly.  You're a gun owner, you want certain things.  Now I'm just, I'm very, I'm being very, I'm focusing in on what suits me.  Because you know what?  When I open it up a little too wide to being a little more liberal in my social agenda, I  get fucked on the other end.  So screw that.  I got enough hands in my pockets yanking cash out by the fucking barrel full to pay for all  these god awful cock programs. 
[02:44:30]  So now, that's it.  I'm going so far conservative with my votes, it's going to, I swear to God, I'm going to  look like a fucking religious zealot.  I swear to you, that's how far right I'm going.  Well, that's why I actually like Clinton to a certain degree and I like McCain, is that  they were kind of more middle of the road party guys, whereas fucking, look, Obama is  a very, very liberal Democrat.  Bush was a very, very conservative Republican.  It's like, that's what I'm tired of.  I'm not, Bloomberg I don't like, but at least Bloomberg is not 100% one way. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  You know what the problem with the Republican Party is?  Yes, too many Jews.  Yes.  We've said this.  No, I'm kidding.  Interesting is the fact that they have gone and tried to appease the population by getting  more liberal.  And you might see that as a moderate Republican, but it's not.  It's a Republican who's compromising his ideology to get votes and to get his poll numbers up 
[02:45:30]  by agreeing with some of the liberal agenda, whether it's a fiscal or a social program.  I disagree, but I'll tell you why.  Because by saying that, in a way you're saying that it's healthier to be a slave to party  lines.  Like, you can't be a conservative guy who's for the death penalty and who is, like, say,  anti-gay marriage, but not be pro-choice.  It's like there's too many things that mix and match in a fucking...  I don't understand what you're saying, but I used to think that that type of compromise 
[02:46:00]  was a good thing, but it fucks you in the end.  Because then nothing gets done.  You're pulling against each other instead of going one way or the other.  And with Opie saying the system is fucked up, he's right.  It's fucked up in that if you do try to weigh your ideology both ways, you know, socially  I'm this, fiscally I'm this, I like a little piece of this and this, and I've been that  way for years, you wind up playing tug of war and getting nowhere.  So me, conservative motherfucker! 
[02:46:30]  Or support, again, it's harder.  I don't know much about Ron Paul or any of the other, but they say support these other  candidates who are...  Paul R. Nelson!  Well, obviously that one.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Look what fucking Ron Perot did.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  As crazy as he was, he got 17% of the vote, man.  He did fuck up the election.  That was the fucking...  But had he not freaked out over his daughter's wedding and been nuts, he might have won that  fucking election.  Freaked out over his daughter's wedding on his daughter's wedding.  I fucked up with the vice president thing. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, you did too.  Yes, you're right.  Stockdale was a weird choice.  That was a horrendous choice.  Yeah.  More importantly, why don't you like people, Ant?  What?  Why don't you like people?  No, see, it's not...  That was a general term.  I'm not going to now sit here...  Do you like the people that party with you?  If I make sacrifices that I don't need to...  I will make my own sacrifices to suit my own needs and needs of people I care about and  I feel need help and I am willing and able to help. 
[02:47:30]  Then I will make the sacrifices that I make.  But I am not going to be told that I need to make these sacrifices for someone else's agenda  that I absolutely don't agree with.  And in order to fight that in this country, we have to get out and vote.  And I will do that accordingly.  I am voting against any of these fucking Democrat, liberal cocksuckers that have done nothing  since they've taken office but tax the living shit out of the only people in this country 
[02:48:00]  that are contributing and giving people jobs, paying people.  What am I supposed to do?  Sit there and suck the tax dick and keep employing people?  No, I'm going to sit there and go,  Bye! I can't pay you anymore! Bye!  Yes, uh, Opie, hand raised.  Why would you suck the tax dick when you could suck the tax tit?  Because the tax dick is shoved in your face. 
[02:48:30]  And it's unpleasant.  You don't get a choice and it's not fun.  The tax tit is the refund.  You don't get it.  That's in the old days. I used to get a refund.  So it's not a choice? There is no such thing as the tax tit?  There's only the tax dick that you suck off?  The big fat tax dick that you gotta suck.  And I'm sick of it, so I am just, I am, I'm, I'm voting.  With the big lever today.  Big lever.  All right.  Adolph, whoever.  I'm pulling the fucking lever.  Funny mustache. 
[02:49:00]  You got my vote.  You don't have to say that.  I just, I just, I'm really voting conservative now.  You don't have to say that.  Yes.  Let's go, Islanders.  All right.  Four in a row I hear.  That's right, my friend.  I told you this team was good.  Second part of the story on the flag ban at the Albany apartment complex.  Even long-time residents like Sharon White, who's flown a flag on her car for eight years,  has been told to take it down.  Well, somebody might be offended, she said.  Holy shit.  And I just told to her, they'll just have to get over it.  Attempts to find out for ourselves why management would ban flags were unsuccessful. 
[02:49:30]  Can you at least verify, are you the person that told them to take the flag down?  I'm not going to answer any questions.  The mother of one soldier.  That's brave.  Why?  That's brave.  Why?  What happened to your fucking balls?  Why not, you fucking coward?  What happened to your balls now?  I'm not going to answer any questions.  Now you've got some tough questions to answer.  Can we have a video of this fucking whatever she is?  What the fuck?  Where's your balls now?  That's enraging.  If you're going to do something like that for the reason of not offending people, 
[02:50:00]  get your fucking face on that camera and explain yourself for such a ridiculous idea.  God, that's fucking enraging.  Barb.  Is her name Barb?  What is it?  Barb.  What?  Barb Wire.  Hold on.  Her last name's Wire.  Barb Holcomb?  Hulk-cum?  Congratulations, Thought Police.  Yeah.  Fucking do it again.  Oh, my God.  No, that wasn't her.  But the New York Times and Maureen Dowd could keep fucking writing columns about how terrible 
[02:50:30]  the church is.  We got it.  How about a fucking column about this shit, you fucking out-of-touch fucking dying newspaper?  They'll never do that.  Let's get to the bottom of this.  I'm not going to answer any questions.  The mother of one soldier fighting in Iraq put up this poster in his apartment window  when she learned of the ban.  His roommate says he'll risk eviction to make sure it stays.  Can you think of a reason the flag would be offensive?  I can't think of anything at all. 
[02:51:00]  Judith Shearer doesn't have a car.  Instead, she pulls an American flag around the complex to protest the ban and wonders if  the flag pin she wears will be next to be singled out.  Well, if I put it on and I walk outside here, what's going to happen?  You know, am I going to be confronted by, you know, a manager about this?  We'll stay on top of the apartment complex.  I promise you that.  And according to the ACLU, the tenant's rights are not being violated by the flag ban since 
[02:51:30]  the apartment complex is private property.  Yeah, the ACLU will go in there and go, no, you've got to take the flag down.  But it's funny.  Really?  So if they had said we would prefer that people don't display homosexual affection, are you  going to tell me that fucking phony ACLU would have said, hey, it's private property?  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  All right.  Fuck the ACLU.  They're another bunch of hypocrites and just, uh, they, they, eh, hypocrites.  They do, look, they do take, they take the side of the Klan. 
[02:52:00]  And they take some very unpopulist stances that you have to admire.  Oh, I thought you were going with the, taking the good with the bad kind of a thing.  No, but I mean, the ACLU defends things that they obviously find morally reprehensible.  Yeah.  But, uh, so if it's private property, their rights are still being violated.  Of course.  Or that again, maybe they have been consistent.  I should shut my mouth.  I don't know enough about that.  No, I think they're inconsistent.  Maybe they've, but I don't know.  Maybe they've allowed, like if in God we trust, if that was there, would they say that  people's right to live in a religious free environment is being violated? 
[02:52:30]  Anyway, they say it's private property, we have no problem with it.  All right, let me go to, uh, Stryker.  Stryker!  Stryker.  Love you.  Hi.  Love the show.  Hi, Stryker.  Anyhow, uh, Anthony, you guys need to get the audio of Jack Cafferty from yesterday  talking about an Obama, uh, tax increase that would call for any individual who earns more  than $500,000 or a couple that earns more than a million will pay an automatic 5% tax 
[02:53:00]  increase while raising taxes on the wealthiest individuals to a minimum of 42%.  Yeah, so you will now pay almost 70% of your taxes.  It's a tax on, on the tax.  Yeah, yeah, they tax you and then they'll tag it, throw another tax on top of it.  Uh, and, you know.  Jack Cafferty does a great explanation of it.  Yeah, let's, let's get that, uh, clip, please.  I'll, I'll hear, uh, good old Jack Cafferty.  He's a crouchy, crouchy old fuck.  That's where my issue with the fucking Democrats is. 
[02:53:30]  It's like, I, I, I don't mind paying higher tax.  I really don't mind paying than, than a guy who doesn't make a lot of money.  I have, I make a good living.  I, I have potential to make a lot of money because I can just go out and do gigs.  I'm lucky.  Yeah.  But when they just keep putting their fucking hands down your throat and they just keep  doing it.  You know, I was bitching about taxes, uh, years ago, as, as always.  But you got used to it and it was like, all right, here's my taxes.  Every year it's pretty much, you know, it was pretty consistent for, for quite a while. 
[02:54:00]  Uh, and every, every three months, you know, when you're paying your quarterly taxes and  things like that.  But then I got, I was just going, what the fuck just happened?  Yeah.  What the fuck happened?  Taxed up the ass.  Wait till your city tax comes in, dude.  You are going to shit your fucking pants.  I was like, thank God I got out of the city.  Meanwhile, I moved to a county that they just raised the school tax like 100%. 
[02:54:30]  And I'm not even kidding.  Doubled the motherfucker.  And, uh, that's because there we got another fucking asshole running that, that place who  get him the fuck out of there.  You need other parties, man.  It's a shame that it's only two parties.  Yeah.  Hopefully that will change.  It's, that's the problem.  Then you can just go by, I like this guy's platform or I like that guy's platform instead  of, I like this group of scumbags or this group of scumbags.  We're not getting the smartest, most qualified people for the job.  No.  We're getting politicians that, uh, groom themselves or are groomed to be politicians. 
[02:55:00]  It's one big fucking, you know, boys club.  It's the same group of fucking assholes and, uh, they run things the same way.  Even Obama talking about change.  We're going to change Washington.  We're going to change Washington.  Uh, and meanwhile, his contributors now, they're finding out, are getting fucking free nights  in the White House and all kinds of fucking other goodies and doodads and the, and the  excuse was, well, this has been done for years. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  What about changing Washington?  You're supposed to change some assholes.  Cleaning up all that bullshit.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Uh, the flag ban has been lifted, by the way.  That's an older story.  So that's good to know.  Matt in Queensbury.  Do we have a picture of this one or no?  That new story?  Okay.  I would have put up a no flags allowed flag.  Oh.  Ha!  She'd have exploded like one of those Star Trek robots you put in a paradox thought.  She wouldn't know what to do.  Where was...  But if you are the person and it's...  And then they blow up when Kirk talks to him.  Well, where, where, where, where did this happen in this apartment? 
[02:56:00]  This was in Albany.  Albany, Oregon.  Oregon.  They couldn't even pick their own name.  Oh, Portland, Oregon.  Very, very liberal.  That's why I was confused.  Poppet of liberal.  I was thinking Albany, New York.  No.  That's not a surprise.  When we get back, will Anthony choose woman finds God in her salami?  Woman calls 911 over loose cows?  That could be...  That first one could mean a few things.  You know?  Because when they're really enjoying themselves.  And we'll throw in the mother of Boy Scout arrested for sex with a 16-year-old Scout. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, dear.  You've got a choice to make after the break.  Go beat Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Playing clean up.  I think we've done the news of the day.  Yeah.  We've talked election.  We've talked World Series.  We've talked about the Islanders. 
[02:57:00]  The fucking Saints still undefeated.  What else?  Oh, Hulk Hogan says he would have quit wrestling for this.  For what?  To be the bass player in Metallica in the 80s.  To be a Hulkamaniac?  Yeah, they would have wanted you.  Yeah, he would have fit in perfectly.  And I think we did most of that stuff.  So, Anthony, it's time to pick.  Right.  I want... 
[02:57:30]  I'm going to add one to the choice.  Oh, shit.  I already had it all decided, but go ahead.  I'm going to add woman steals case of beer between legs.  Woman finds God in her salami.  It's like the Asian guy in the Prestige with the big fishbowl.  See, now I can laugh at that because I saw the Prestige.  Yeah, Prestige, finally.  And I got Creepshow right here.  You saw that.  Yeah.  I'm going to be in with the Creepshow references.  Goddamn Creepshow rules.  I'm going to be in with the references.  Found a friend, Harry. 
[02:58:00]  I know that line, though.  Woman calls 911 over loose cows.  Woman finds God in her salami.  And the mother of a Boy Scout arrested for sex with a 16-year-old scout.  Which one do you want?  I'm going for salami.  Salami it is.  Let's find God in salami.  New Anna Nicole video out.  What?  What?  I don't know, dude.  For jaw-dropping?  Jimmy just had a spit take.  Sorry, Jim. 
[02:58:30]  That's hilarious.  The jaw-drop.  You really are dead when you're jaw-dropping.  That is a horrible part of that whole thing.  Yeah, that's the last time your body will ever move.  Yuck.  Excuse me.  Instant feedbackers.  If you're going to try to bring material to the show, we greatly appreciate that.  Because it's kind of your show, too.  Yeah.  Give me more details.  I don't know what new Anna Nicole video means.  I don't have time to do the research.  Yeah, the research.  How about you add in?  Give all the details, please. 
[02:59:00]  Add in a little bit.  Here's the salami story.  I believe in God, but I don't practice it.  I don't go to church all the time.  On occasion, I do.  Most people find inspiration in the Bible, the Koran, or in their local place of worship.  But a woman in Miami-Dade, Florida says she found God in her salami.  You find inspiration there.  Yeah.  Inspiration for what?  Lopping off heads?  Jesus.  Stop it.  You don't have to say the Koran.  You're fucking assholes.  Could have said the Torah.  Exactly.  The Bible.  Happy endings.  I hate your guts. 
[02:59:30]  Lots of places.  Fucking biased, bitch.  Swank.  Oh, they've got to add in that, get that to Koran, boy.  Yeah, we understand.  It's a peaceful religion we've heard.  We got it.  Yeah, they're full of peaceful people that are loving, and that's what a whole religion is,  and it's just a few bad apples.  As Colin said on Tough Crowd, let me yell at a few million bad apples, spoiled a bunch.  A few million bad apples.  Well, yeah, what are you going to do?  A few million bad apples.  That's a lot of bad apples.  Yes. 
[03:00:00]  The Koran, or in their local place of worship, but a woman in Miami-Dade, Florida, says she  found God in her salami.  Yes, her salami.  Nancy Simoes says while she was cooking her meal, the letters G-O-D were burned into the  three slices of salami in her frying pan.  Simoes says she isn't making this up and still has the salami to prove it.  Why is the news doing a story on this?  We're looking at the picture.  Wow.  It is so ridiculous.  It's not even a picture like it usually is.  It's three separate pieces of fried salami. 
[03:00:30]  One has the G, one has the O, and one has what looks like a D.  Another O that she says is a D.  Could be just goo.  It's goo.  She found goo in her salami.  I'll give you a salami full of goo.  Hey, news, you don't have to report on everything.  No.  This should have been...  No.  Relax.  You really don't have to.  I want to personally apologize for choosing the God salami audio. 
[03:01:00]  Well, you didn't know it was words.  That was my decision.  I know I did.  I should have done a little research so as not to embarrass the show and disappoint the  listener.  You should have thought of that years ago.  Waddle doodle.  I'm sorry.  All right, now we've got to focus on the Anna Nicole video because, Eric, thank you.  You should have said this immediately.  Check CNN.  She's stoned out of her mind.  Thinks a doll is her real baby.  On CNN?  But that's not a new video. 
[03:01:30]  That's been out a long time ago.  I remember that.  This might be a new version of it or something.  CNN wouldn't just pop an old fucking video up there.  Sure they would.  Those dopes.  They probably didn't know it was old.  They probably didn't know she's dead.  Well, when Danny comes back, we'll fucking find that for everybody.  How did it happen?  I was watching the last time Basic Instinct was on.  The pussy scene where she flashes her puss.  It's still sexy.  I mean, it's not like it used to be, but it's still a sexy behavior.  And she had great legs, Sharon Stone. 
[03:02:00]  To open, that little way she opens to be cockteed like that.  And she's talking to Michael Douglas.  She's like, you're a fuck on coke, Nick.  And it's really a sexy scene.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She looked really good in Casino.  Yeah, she looked real good in Casino.  There's that scene after she fucks Pesci and she's sitting in bed.  And the sheet is kind of like showing one of her legs or sticking out from under the sheet.  And I really don't find her, you know, she's a little too, that fake look for me, kind of. 
[03:02:30]  A little too Hollywood, a little too blonde, fucking bombshell-ish.  I like, you know, girl next door look.  More than that whole fucking, you know.  Yeah, if you live next door to Playboy Mansion.  Ha ha ha, Jimmy.  Jimmy!  Ha ha ha!  Jimmy, holy shit!  Jesus.  That's very funny.  Danny, go to CNN.com.  We have the Nicole videos up there.  She's talking to a fucking doll thinking it's her baby, I think. 
[03:03:00]  You're going to respond to Jimmy Conaway's Twitter like that?  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  I want my fucking tweets!  Ha ha ha!  Fuck him, that cigarette hijacking Mick!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  He hasn't been following for months.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  That cigarette hijacking Mick!  I could have dropped dime on him.  Like, oh, shut the fuck up.  That right there, you're going to get an ice pick in the back of your head.  Absolutely disturbing footage of Anna Nicole Smith in clown makeup completely spaced out 
[03:03:30]  at a child's birthday party in 2006.  She can't figure out if she's pregnant or if she has gas.  Watch this.  Do you have something?  The clown needs some medicine.  I know I want some.  I need some.  Because look how big he wants to build his skin.  Because it's gas.  It's your baby.  No.  It's gas.  It's your baby. 
[03:04:00]  The clown doesn't need gas medicine.  She needs baby medicine.  No, it's gas.  Baby.  Baby.  You know how when you're having gas and you feel it, it's like, ow.  That's your baby kicking you.  No.  My baby's over there.  Watch this.  Half the video, by the way, is obscure with your logo.  Let me just get a shot of the baby right here. 
[03:04:30]  No.  Yeah, put it down.  This is so, so, so, so stupid.  He gives a shit about this one.  Yeah.  Locker.  Look.  Shocker.  She's having brain trouble.  Brain trouble.  First of all, the fact that this young child was exposed to this type of thing.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Young child was exposed to this. 
[03:05:00]  Talk to her bitch.  Shut up.  Ended with Smith's doctors and former boyfriend, Howard K. Stern, ordered to stand trial on  charges they illegally provided.  They literally had half of that video blocked out with their dog shit CNN logo.  Yeah.  And Nicole Smith forgets she was pregnant.  Well, first of all, I have to say, Brooke, the fact that she's...  You've died of a drug overdose, you assholes.  Who cares?  It's so extraordinarily disturbing on so many levels.  Oh, it's not disturbing.  It's extraordinarily disturbing.  But to answer your question, yes, when you are very, very high and stoned, you can forget 
[03:05:30]  a lot.  You know, there's that comedy movie, Dude, Where's My Car?  About two potheads who get wasted and they wake up the next morning and they can't remember  where they left their car.  Really?  Sounds hysterical.  I want to see that.  It happens all the time.  In fact, with alcoholism, for example, there's something called...  I'm glad you had to explain the concept of Dude, Where's My Car?  Dude, Where's My Car?  I would have never figured out that was about two stoners looking for their vehicle.  ...as a result of the substance abuse.  So this can and does happen.  It's very, very sad to watch. 
[03:06:00]  That's not sad.  Now, a judge decided the video will not be played when Stern and Anna's two doctors go  on trial in December, although it will be in evidence.  Is he here today?  Anyone see him?  He couldn't be sure that this video showed that Anna was on drugs.  Carlos, not on drugs.  Still waiting for the big sighting.  The big power Stern's standing.  But what do you think?  Was she acting?  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, if you've seen this whole video, and I've seen the whole thing, there's no point  where you see Anna Nicole Smith taking drugs.  So it's wise for the judge not to have this in court for any kind of jury to see. 
[03:06:30]  But if you've ever interviewed Anna Nicole Smith, she always kind of acts kind of out there.  But this, not knowing that you have a baby in your stomach and thinking that it might  be gas, that's taking it to the nth degree.  Why?  This has to be an old story.  Yeah, she did.  Nicholas Cage earned $40 million.  That's not new.  That isn't...  She's dead.  That's not post-dead.  She never realized...  She never thought the video would be shown to the world, you dopes.  You remember that TV show that she had? 
[03:07:00]  She was high all the time?  I'm like, how is this a surprise to anybody?  Gives a shit.  She's dead and rotting somewhere.  You're kidding me.  The kid's better off.  How did this happen?  The fucking kid's better off.  Maybe he has a...  What?  The girl.  Oh, I thought you meant the other one.  No.  That's what I mean.  She didn't do a good job with him, right?  So maybe her daughter has a chance at a good life.  Woman calls 911 over loose cows, or woman steals a case of beer between legs, or mother 
[03:07:30]  of Boy Scout arrested for sex with 16-year-old boy.  Let's go sex.  Sex sells, right, Aunt?  Sex it is.  You're still thinking of her jugs?  Well, the point it is.  You're still thinking of Jody or Judy, what the fuck was her name?  Jody Sweeten.  Had some sweet jugs.  Sweeten was a good name for her to have.  Sweeten Big.  Police say 33-year-old Courtney Shward was a leader in her son's Boy Scout troop in North 
[03:08:00]  Fort Worth.  Now she's in jail, held on $25,000 bond, accused of sexual assault of a child.  It was through her involvement as a volunteer parent that she met the 16-year-old male  victim, and a relationship began, and as a result of that relationship, they had non-forceable  sex.  Police say even though the sex wasn't forced, she still committed the crime of sexual assault  because the victim is under 17 and considered a juvenile.  The detectives are investigating allegations there's at least one other victim. 
[03:08:30]  The arrest of Ms. Sheward was based upon legal sufficient proof that she had sex with  a person under 17 years of age.  However, our investigation is continuing into the possibility and likelihood of other victims.  An executive with the Scout's Longhorn Council, which includes Tarrant County, says,  obviously we're deeply outraged by the actions, and we feel for the families.  We're waiting for the outcome of the investigation.  Outcome.  Whatever. 
[03:09:00]  Fucking 16-year-old boy can handle having sex with an older woman.  I think so.  Yeah, it's not a child.  Yeah.  And it's, you know, that way.  I guess I understand you gotta do something about it as far as the law goes, but I don't  think the kid's gonna be fucked up.  Teen boy on woman, um, fine.  Teen woman, uh, teen, you know, girl on man.  Man, you got a problem.  There's certainly a double, depending on the age.  There's definitely a double standard.  Yeah, yeah.  There absolutely is. 
[03:09:30]  Absolutely.  Did you know any of your, uh, um, oh no, you were the guy, right?  What?  That was having sex with, like, an older woman when you were just a kid?  Well, not, yeah, well.  Huh.  Yeah.  That was the only time that ever happened.  I'm trying to think back.  But none of my friends were having sex with older women, because we were pretty nerdy.  Yeah, I was going to school after, you know, getting a little pre-school, um, not pre-school. 
[03:10:00]  You got some pre-school?  No, before school.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Co-fucking-K!  And got some pre-school.  See, before school.  Co-fucking-K!  Before school.  Yeah.  Old Buzz.  Old Buzz had come over.  Good old Buzz.  Buzz.  Chris.  Her name was Christine.  Did she have some nice hangers?  Big-ass tics.  Bigums?  Some bigums?  Big.  But she was a big girl, not a great big fat person. 
[03:10:30]  But she was very tall, like a very voluptuous kind of shape.  Was she hippie?  Yeah, yeah, hips, big tits, tall, and a giant 70s bush.  Dude, it was so giant.  And she goes, because, you know, I was pretty new at all this stuff.  And she goes, you know, oh, I want to do this to you. 
[03:11:00]  So, you know, she starts going down on me and shit.  Ew.  And it was great.  It was fantastic.  So she starts doing that, and she goes, you want to do that to me?  And all I did was I went, no.  Yeah.  I actually looked and said, no.  You're an asshole.  Her, I mean.  It was crazy.  The hell.  Oh, my God.  Danny's doing some really good pictures.  Remember just licking through all that shit, though, to try to get to the goodness?  Oh, my God.  You're breaking hairs. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, Jesus.  It was.  It was like a closed Venus fly trap.  You had to open with your tongue.  It was like.  That is fucking terrible.  It was very confusing, because it started out as torture, but ended with some goodness.  Some goodness.  But to get to that sometimes.  It always ended with some goodness.  I'm going to say for the record, if you have a hairy pussy, you should be thrown out of  the country.  No, no.  It depends on the.  Oh, see.  That's crazy.  It's disgusting.  Get rid of it.  But.  But.  It's fucking awful.  Evolution.  You don't need it.  You're not foraging for fucking berries and nuts. 
[03:12:00]  You're not squatting with your pussy and dirt, rubbing sticks together for fucking fire.  Was that what the hair was for?  To keep.  Sure of course.  It was to fucking brush the dirt away so your fucking box lips didn't get all dusty.  Do you know anything about fucking anthropology?  Thank you, Dr. Jimmy Norton.  That's exactly what it's for.  You know what?  It makes a good point.  It almost does make sense that you wouldn't want dirt getting in there.  Yeah.  And the hair would kind of keep it away.  It would work as like a fucking street sweeper while you're sitting there foraging for fucking  nuts and berries and little rocks to build fucking hats out of. 
[03:12:30]  How about this?  How about you shave it?  Evolution is dictated you don't need it anymore.  It's fucking gross.  You don't look like a little kid.  All it does is trap sweat and makes your fucking box smell.  See, a little bit.  It's awful too.  It's just less awful than a lot.  It would smell like a wet dog.  No, I'm not talking about that.  How about none?  How about I want a bowl over your pussy?  I want to fucking do an 8-10 split over your lips.  Fucking beat it with hair. 
[03:13:00]  But it makes them a little more unique, each one, when there's just a little shape of a hair there.  But not growing.  I'm not talking about Sam's fucking head.  It makes it unique.  My face and it's my own spin.  Who are you protecting?  I'm not protecting anybody.  Who are you protecting?  I swear to you, I'd say something if I was.  Nobody.  I'm just saying there's something about a little bit just to let me know that's the area. 
[03:13:30]  That's it.  When you see it at a distance, walking over to the bed.  If you don't know where the area is at this point in your life, you've got a problem.  I'm not talking about I need it for targeting.  You've got a problem.  You know it's the area.  Really?  You know it's the area?  It's like crop circles.  There's a bear there feeding.  You know it's the area.  Are you drinking that much that you need, like, fucking...  No.  No, no.  I'm not talking about that, like, needed for target acquisition.  Okay. 
[03:14:00]  Just, there's something, you know, womanly about it.  And, and, and, but, no, you're, you're, you're icking at this long, hairy thing that is ick.  Laser that shit off.  I'm talking...  Danny, show him a good, good picture of, uh, a woman.  Like...  I've got to close the old machine.  Yeah.  That's stubble.  Danny's going to show you a good picture of a woman.  Just a little longer than stubble.  How about this?  Where it's just velvety.  Like velveteen.  Yuck.  Velveteen.  Like my head.  You want a little... 
[03:14:30]  The definitive work.  You want wispy?  Yes, like Jimmy's head.  Why?  That would fucking...  I want to fuck Jimmy's head.  That's doable.  I want you to put your dick between my ear and skull.  You know what kind of rash you would get if you fucked Jimmy's head?  No, his hair is very soft.  That's not soft.  Oh, yeah, it is.  That'll do some fucking dance.  My hair is soft.  They call me old Velveteen head.  Old Velveteen.  Because it's soft like cheese and shit.  That was my nickname in motherfucking high school.  Yo, Velveteen head.  There you go, man.  Is that what you want?  Yes, that's what I want. 
[03:15:00]  There you go.  That's a man with a vagina.  It looks like swirling hairs around the...  The asshole looks like a fucking hurricane in the Atlantic.  It looks like Dan Haggerty.  It's horrible.  Is that enough hair for you?  The eye of the storm.  Is that enough hair for you?  Dude, will anyone ever understand what I'm talking about?  Nope.  I'm talking about a very light triangle of velvety.  A dusting.  Just kind of there to let you know it's there. 
[03:15:30]  All right, we'll find another one for you.  Just kind of...  We'll find another one for you.  It's sexy when a girl's just laying on her back in bed and you kind of see that.  It's not.  Yeah, it is.  All right.  Don't believe me.  I'm not fucking going, ew, no hair, get out.  That isn't, you know, my style.  How about that?  Oh, God damn.  What is that?  That looks like someone's gutting a deer.  Ugh!  That is terrible.  That's matted.  It's an old lady's vag being held open. 
[03:16:00]  It's a bullet wound in the back of a fucking German Shepherd.  It's Kennedy's fucking missing autopsy photo.  Commander James Humes took that picture.  That's his hand holding the flap of skull.  How about this tasty delight right here, Ant?  No!  Oh, God!  What's wrong with that one, huh?  Who the fuck is you?  Stop it.  She looks like Manny Ramirez.  She looks fucking horrible.  Manny!  Then a lady holding open something.  That's disgusting.  Looks like her vag is like something a miner would fall into. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Fucking break his back.  It's just a big gaping hole with a pig nose in it.  She is horrendous.  It's like that Star Wars sand monster thing.  Yeah.  Anthony, one more choice today.  A woman calls 911 over the loose cows, or a woman steals a case of beer between  legs.  Well, I think as far as audio goes, I think the 911 call always beats out just some newsreader  talking about a theft. 
[03:17:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  Bad choice.  Horrible choice.  There's a little bit there.  Is it?  Why?  You want to go with the other ones?  Horrible choice.  Horrible, horrible choice.  Why do I get to keep picking when I've picked such horrible ones?  I don't like the stripe.  I don't like the strip.  I don't like the fucking Hitler mustache thing.  If you're going to have anything down there, natural shape, just velvety.  No.  No.  Nothing.  Velvety.  No.  Velvety.  Velvety.  I don't want a fucking pimp pussy. 
[03:17:30]  We didn't know you were going with the natural.  No.  I thought you were shaving the sides and all that shit down.  No.  And I'm saying yes, yes, yes.  To a workable area.  Yes, yes.  Triangular.  Triangular.  No.  No.  Yes, you shave the whole fucking, all the sides.  You get rid of all that crap.  How about none of it?  But you just leave a little lawn.  How about a Yankee logo?  Yeah, go Yankees.  Oh, fucking fish.  Fuck them.  Fuck them all.  Like I told you in high school, they used to call me Velveeta head motherfucker.  That was my nickname because they said my head felt like Velveeta cheese and shit. 
[03:18:00]  And shit.  911 dispatchers have a tough job and there's no better example of that than the call you're  about to hear in which a woman calls furious that deputies won't help her with her cows.  When Tammy Noodleman called 911, she was told her escaped cows were not an emergency.  That's when she called again.  I got seven fucking cows out loose, maybe going to the fucking highway.  Okay, ma'am.  You need to let everybody know that there are loose cows out there before they caused a  major fucking accident. 
[03:18:30]  You hear me?  As tempers rise, the dispatcher stays cool.  Why are you yelling at me?  Because I tried to call before and you guys said it wasn't a fucking emergency.  No, ma'am.  This is Tammy Noodleman.  When we spoke with her, she didn't sound anything like the enraged woman we heard on  the 911 call.  Tammy says she was panicked and shouldn't have yelled.  I'm sorry, you know, for talking that way, you know, to the dispatcher.  And I said, I'll accept the citation and it won't happen again. 
[03:19:00]  She was right to yell like that.  Loose cows that could walk on the highway.  That's actually a legitimate reason.  It's a little dangerous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But yelling, I mean, shut the fuck up.  There's a lady when no one was sent to help.  Shut the fuck up.  What did I say to her?  On the call, Tammy refuses to give even basic information.  You don't need to give me your date of birth.  You come and get my date of birth.  We will have a deputy come out there.  A deputy did come to Tammy's home to give her a citation for misuse of 911. 
[03:19:30]  At the time that this lady had called in, was swearing at my dispatchers, my dispatchers  were working on an accident, a motorcycle accident with severe injuries.  Do you feel like you overreacted on that call?  Um, yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, who doesn't, you know, when you call 911?  Who doesn't?  Tammy says she regrets making that call and she will pay the citation, but she is angry 
[03:20:00]  that the sheriff's department has released that call to the public.  I don't think she did anything wrong.  Yeah, that's, uh, whatever.  When your cows are loose, like, like, I say to a girl sometimes, like, I'll eat your pussy  till the cows come home.  But I've never said I'll eat your pussy till the cows get loose.  Because who knows when the cows will come home.  Sometimes they're out all night.  They have their spots all switched up.  Exactly.  Giving their milk out.  And the last one, the one you did not pick.  Ah.  We'll throw it in as a goof. 
[03:20:30]  People have been going in and out of this place for decades.  Crossroads Grocery in Zachary is a well-known one-stop shop.  Workers here say they've seen their fair share of thieves.  But one person recently caught on camera took things to a whole new level.  This is unusual that a woman can hold that up.  Zachary Police Captain David McDavid says he's never seen anything like this before.  McDavid says this woman seen here wearing an oversized house coat, 
[03:21:00]  stuffed a case of beer up her dress, stole some sodas,  and waddled out of crossroads on August 2nd.  One month later...  Anything you want to say to your children?  Police believe this is the woman from that surveillance video.  42-year-old Lisa Newsom of Baker.  With her head hung low in handcuffs,  Newsom didn't have much to say.  With everything caught on camera,  police say Newsom admitted to swiping the coat  and holding out a large case of beer between her legs. 
[03:21:30]  She attempted to show us how she did it,  but we told her not to pull her pants down.  Fuck, if you can pull that off, let her have the fucking beer.  That is, you know, I was goofing about the prestige thing,  but that's pretty much...  That's exactly what she did.  Exactly what she did there.  That's pretty fucking impressive.  Remember when Mindy from Big Butt Magazine?  Oh, Mindy.  I think...  It's Mindy.  It's Mindy.  It's Mindy.  Mindy Teats.  Mindy or Mindy? 
[03:22:00]  Mindy.  Mindy.  How do you spell that?  M-E-N-D-Y.  M-I-N-D-Y?  M-E.  M-E.  M-E.  F-A-T-P-I-G.  Found the picture, though.  Remember when she, at a live broadcast,  swallowed a beer in her puss.  Oh, yes.  Shoved a beer in her puss.  And then we opened the beer.  Opened the beer.  And one of our listeners fucking drank it.  You never saw the can the entire time.  It flew out of her vagina.  Yeah.  The bearded, like a fucking... 
[03:22:30]  It was a tall boy, too, I believe.  Shoved up her pussy.  Yeah, you couldn't see it.  And then the guy pulled the fucking tab, and it just shot all in his face, and he drank it.  It was amazing.  What a day for sport.  Good old Mindy.  She doing good?  I think she went into real estate.  Did she?  Yes.  I think she moved down to Florida.  I don't know.  I think she went to Florida and is doing real estate or something now.  Really, huh?  That's how she judges people. 
[03:23:00]  Like, I want to buy something for a house about your size.  Yeah.  God bless her.  She was a biggin'.  She did some good stuff for us over the years.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, guys.  I think that's it.  Yeah.  Fuck them.  We're going to pack it in.  Mm-hmm.  I, um...  Where are we putting it in here?  Old Friend by Warren Haynes.  I'm putting that up on my YouTube channel, OP Radio, later today.  Maybe some behind-the-scenes stuff from, uh...  What was her name again?  Sharon Osbourne?  Jody Sweetin.  Jody Sweetin. 
[03:23:30]  So you could take a look at her jugs.  Yeah.  And, uh...  I think that's it.  Cool.  I have Houston this weekend.  Oh, right.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  And, uh...  Night before Thanksgiving, Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  Night after Thanksgiving.  And night after that, Boston, Massachusetts.  Mm-hmm.  And then January 24-25.  Boston.  Uh, no, AC.  Borgata, I return.  Atlantic City.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. 
[03:24:00]  Mm.  All right.  Fun.  It's a fun gig.  Fun.  Can we go now?  Yes.  Let us go.  And we will see you all right here tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony program.  Hit the lasers!  Hit the lasers! </pre>
