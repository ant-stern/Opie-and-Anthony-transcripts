<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion of the Miami Heat's winning streak and March Madness, veering into explicit commentary on the attractiveness of a college coach's wife (who was featured in Maxim Magazine).  This transitioned to Tiger Woods' return to the top golf ranking, again featuring explicit commentary on the appearances of his current girlfriend and ex-wife, followed by a discussion of the psychological aspects of golf and a humorous anecdote about a difficult TV installation.  The hosts then discussed the racism in "The Little Rascals," privacy concerns with the Xbox Kinect, and a Skype call with family.

The show then focused on a suspended EMT’s racist and anti-Semitic tweets, sparking a debate about free speech, cancel culture, and media bias. The hosts’ own mentions in Gawker and Mediaite were discussed, with the conversation continuing in a vulgar and offensive manner.  Jimmy Norton joined the show towards the end of this segment, contributing to the discussion and sharing a personal anecdote about Nick Cannon.

The next major segment tackled the erosion of free speech in the context of social media and workplace repercussions, drawing parallels to the hosts' own radio experiences.  This was interwoven with darkly humorous discussions: the death of a rapper (hinted to have AIDS), the Heaven's Gate mass suicide (detailing the method and rationale), a 17-year-old selling a news aggregator app for $30 million,  a Powerball winner’s struggles, and a bizarre IRS Star Trek parody training video. The segment concluded with discussions of tax season, an anecdote about an accountant nicknamed "Clown Nose Guy," and a British school banning triangular flapjacks after a child was hit in the face with one, all peppered with vulgar jokes.  Shane Smith from Vice was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

A subsequent segment addressed a previous segment on the Michael Mears show criticizing Opie's past "attack dog" role against Don and Mike.  The hosts discussed their past feud and reconciliation, particularly after Don's wife's passing; a clip from the Michael Mears show was played.  This segued into a debate on Jimmy Fallon versus Jimmy Kimmel, criticizing Jay Leno. Sal, the drummer, performed songs by Queens of the Stone Age and System of a Down for the third consecutive show, leading to discussions of child drummers. A listener's feedback sparked an argument between Opie and Eric. A significant portion focused on X-Pac's anus injury, with graphic details and video footage shown, including online searches for "sphincteroplasty." The segment concluded with mention of Shane Smith from Vice and a live read for a product masking the taste of oral sex.

The interview with Shane Smith from Vice focused on his experiences filming documentaries in dangerous locations. He detailed his time in North Korea, encounters with warlords (including "General Butt Naked") in Africa, experiences in Liberia (including the assassination and cannibalization of President Samuel Doe), the conflicts in Congo and Nigeria, and encounters with the Taliban in Afghanistan, including an interview with Hamid Ghul. The conversation, punctuated by the hosts and later Rachel Feinstein,  included humorous and vulgar tangents, especially about parasites and bodily functions.

The final segment featured comedian Rachel Feinstein. The conversation began with vulgar and racially charged comments on racial differences and parasites.  Feinstein discussed her upcoming Showtime special, "Women Who Kill," and shared anecdotes from her high school, her father (a civil rights lawyer), and filming the special.  Other topics included a listener’s crude comment about Feinstein’s online photos, a detailed discussion of a parasite attracted to ammonia, a promotion for the movie "This is 40," a highly sexually charged discussion of DJ Who Kid's Instagram, and a past Opie and Anthony segment involving a "gay off" challenge. DJ Who Kid participated throughout, contributing to the offensive and sexually explicit humor.  The segment concluded with Feinstein promoting her stand-up performance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  Ooh!  Well, that sounds like showtime.  It's showtime.  That sounds like, ah, what they call that, showtime.  I know you don't watch basketball, but holy fuck, man.  The Miami Heat have won 27 games in a row.  Oh, yeah?  That's pretty crazy in the NBA.  Mars knows. 
[00:00:30]  That's big?  That's pretty crazy in the NBA to get a streak like that going.  I think the record is 33?  33.  33 by the Lakers, right?  The old school Lakers?  Yes.  The team that had Gale Goodrich?  Was that the 1972 Lakers?  I believe so, Anthony.  Cool me out.  Oh, man.  Look at me.  I believe so.  Look at me go.  I was watching the news.  But 27 straight, that's crazy.  Yeah.  Hey, but I don't think this formula is going to continue working.  The formula is that they've been doing lackadaisical first two periods. 
[00:01:00]  Look, man.  We're not ESPN.  We're just putting a headline out there and acknowledging that, holy fuck, that's pretty  crazy.  They've won 27 in a row.  We're not going to do game analysis now.  Well, obviously, the strategy's not going to work all the time because it's lackadaisical  for two periods.  What is he talking about, lackadaisical?  They've got to get a little hustle going in a couple of the first periods.  And I think you're going to see these guys continuing their victories.  Mars has just been sitting in wait. 
[00:01:30]  He couldn't wait for us to finally bring this up.  What are you talking about?  A little commentary.  What are you talking about?  First of all, they always have a deficit, a large deficit, for the first two quarters.  Right.  And then they let go of LeBron goes loose.  Yeah, you're right.  He's amazing.  They've had some amazing comebacks in the streak.  A few games that they should have absolutely lost, and they came back.  Well, LeBron looked like a go-to guy in the second half of the game, obviously. 
[00:02:00]  So what are they supposed to do?  Mars?  Yeah, Mars.  Well, I don't know.  Mars, the guy that's never fucking stepped onto an NBA court?  Are you kidding me?  Well, you definitely have it.  Right?  Do you think he can do it?  Could he step onto it?  Turn on his mic.  Could he step onto it?  Whoa.  Turn on his mic.  Oh, shit.  Wow, man.  You lost a lot of the audience, man.  Oh, shit.  And they were all with you, too.  They were all with you.  I thought that was a dumb move.  Do I think he could step on a court?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  No.  Yeah, I know.  I could play a little bit.  But anyway.  Not the NBA.  Anyway, they got some really...  So what are they supposed to do?  Three games that are coming up that are pretty tough.  They want to...  They have to...  They got to get past the Spurs.  Exactly.  That's one of the teams they got to beat to get that record.  I looked.  I looked at what they got left before this streak, you know, sets a record.  And don't forget Chicago.  The Spurs are incredibly good as well.  They got...  I think they're the only other team with over 50 wins this season, I think. 
[00:03:00]  I'm not really sure, but I'm guessing on that.  Now, does that mean they're, like, in first place?  Oh, God.  They're killing everybody.  Is that what you call it?  Yeah.  They kill basketball in first place?  They're killing everybody, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, but yeah, they're going to fucking skate to the finals, and then we'll see what happens.  Well, I'm not really paying much attention to pro basketball, because I'm...  My brackets.  I'm looking at March Madness and my brackets.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You got that Florida team?  Because I did.  Yeah, yeah, I got that.  I'm one of the only ones... 
[00:03:30]  Oh, you got them, too?  I got them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm one of the only ones in the entire country that picked those fuckers.  Yeah?  Yep.  How's UConn doing?  UConn's doing great.  That's my team right there.  UConn, all the way.  You love the UConn.  UConn.  I got UConn all the way.  University Central Florida?  Is that what it is?  Mars?  Yeah, bracket, bracket.  Oh, he's excited.  He's running to the bike again.  He's all about the basketball.  I don't follow college ball.  Oh.  Wow, why?  The NCAA tournament is terrific. 
[00:04:00]  Everyone gets their brackets.  I'm not into it.  And then you compare brackets with the people you work with.  It's all about your brackets.  Right.  And you got that team coming out of nowhere who has, the coach has the hottest wife in  the NCAA.  What is that, the 15th seed?  Yeah, the 15th seed.  First time that has happened, I believe.  Yes.  And his wife is a piece of ass.  Oh, is she?  The coach's wife is a piece of ass.  Yes, she was on the cover of Maxim Magazine.  Well.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  That's something right there. 
[00:04:30]  Wait till you see what she looks like.  Got to give him some credit.  It's another one of these scenarios where the guy is like, holy fuck, he's in the spot.  He's in the spotlight because he's doing something cool and something that hasn't been done.  And then all of a sudden they take a peek at his wife and now it's all about his wife.  Overshadowed by the chick.  It's in the paper today.  Oh, man, it is.  Yeah, you got to see a picture.  Open your workbooks.  Which workbook?  What is it?  Florida Gulf Community College or something like that.  Right?  Is it the Post or the Daily News?  Florida Gulf Coast. 
[00:05:00]  Oh.  Yeah, man.  Fuckin', I'll show you.  I'll show you something right here.  Open your copies of Land of Liberty and...  Oh, shit.  Can't remember what Mr. Hand's book was.  All right.  Give me the other paper.  What is it?  That's his wife.  Wait, wait, wait.  What on paper is that?  That's the other one.  The Post, I guess.  The fucking Post.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's his wife.  She was on the cover of Maxim Magazine.  Jeez Louise, let me see.  So, you know, the focus is... 
[00:05:30]  Who's that?  Oh, that's fuckin' Victoria's Secret model.  Yeah, the focus is not so much on the coach because now everyone's learning his wife is a...  Oh, it's what page?  ...is a piece of ass.  Ugh.  61.  Our brothers.  What page?  61.  Why would you put that on 61?  Shouldn't that be on the front page?  Oh, I need my own paper.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  She is, um, sultry.  She's, uh, she's a looker.  Looker, she's wearing some kind of fuckin' little lingerie thing. 
[00:06:00]  Uh, yeah, she was in one of those Maxim, uh, girlish shoes, right?  She's got the smoky eyes.  Yes.  I like that smoky whore eye look thing.  Big fan of that?  Yeah, you know what?  I think I am.  I like slut eyes.  I like a girl whose mascara is all smeared on their face when they wake up in the morning.  Hot.  That means you got some things done.  Yeah.  You got some work done.  The night prior.  You put in your time.  So, uh, yeah, man, this team is doing pretty well. 
[00:06:30]  I think I see our nips through this.  Yeah, well, yeah, you gotta show a little nip if you're on, um, the cover of Maxim.  It's in the rules.  But you're on page 61 of the fuckin'.  It's in the rules.  Jeez.  The post.  So, uh, obviously no one picked this team in their brackets.  It's, um, because everyone just conservatively picks the fuckin' favorites.  Mm.  Everyone's, I, I, I would bet you, I, I could grab ten people's brackets today around here  and they're all pretty much the same.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You gotta, you gotta grab a couple of those weird teams and throw them up there.  That's when you start standing out.  Yeah, but, uh, the odds that you're gonna get those weird teams.  Right.  The right weird teams, you know?  It's like the long shots when you're picking horses.  And then it turns out Obama has 11 out of the 16.  That's not bad.  He does?  He has 11 out of the 16.  He started out pretty bad and, uh, came back strong.  Well, we finally found something you can do well.  Picking brackets.  Great.  I told you before the show, though, because they had the big, uh, press conference of him 
[00:07:30]  with his, it, it, it still bothers me that he writes with his left hand.  I don't know why.  It's weird to me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Is he the first left-handed president?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  There's so many lefties.  Who was the last left-handed president?  I think there was a lot of lefties.  You think?  Right?  Isn't that what I hear?  Clinton?  A lot of lefties, of course.  Clinton was a lefty, yeah.  But I mean, uh, left-handed.  Oh, left-handed.  I thought you meant.  So he's, uh, filling out his brackets.  And I looked at him, I'm like, he obviously talked to some kind of college basketball expert 
[00:08:00]  before he did his brackets.  I'm sure he knows a little bit.  Has he appointed a bracket czar?  Probably.  Is that what it is?  Where's my bracket czar?  Because he doesn't want to look like an idiot, and I don't think he has time to follow college  basketball that closely.  So he has a meeting behind closed doors, and then goes out there, he makes some of his  picks, but then he takes some of the picks of the expert.  Fucking brackets.  So he doesn't look like an asshole.  Well, he can, uh... 
[00:08:30]  We owe, we owe.  He's still got a, uh, he's still got a together bracket, huh?  Yeah, he's got 11 out of the 16.  Hasn't busted that shit up yet, yo.  No, so...  Now we have to wait until Friday, I guess, to see if this, uh, community college out of  Florida, you know, advances.  Community college?  I guess they didn't even start having classes until 97.  Wow, really?  Yeah, and then they didn't, uh...  They had a losing record just last year.  Whoops.  And this year they're doing pretty damn well. 
[00:09:00]  All eyes are on that, uh...  Must be because of their lackadaisical first half of the game, and then they come back  in the second half, uh, full of piss and vinegar.  What are they supposed to do differently?  Just get crazy as soon as the game starts?  Yeah, they're not supposed to create such a deficit, especially with San Antonio.  San Antonio's not gonna let them come back.  San Antonio's gonna make it hard for them to set that record.  We all know that.  Everyone knows that.  Sports talk with Mars.  Well, you know, I...  But it's special.  Yeah.  27 games in a row. 
[00:09:30]  27 games in a row is a big fucking deal.  It is.  That's, that is, I'm telling you, that's pretty crazy.  Gotta believe it ya.  And then you got the Tiger Woods, uh, officially number one.  That's crazy right there.  And then everyone attacking me on Twitter, I already said that I was wrong about the Tiger Woods.  Because I, when it all went down with the wife and the nine iron and all that shit and  the fucking Perkins waitress, I said on this very show that he's done.  And he will never have a...  I said he'll win a few tournaments, but he'll never come back. 
[00:10:00]  And be the man that, uh, you know, he was.  But I, I updated that a while ago and said, man, am I wrong.  I'm really wrong on this one.  But everyone was thinking that, too.  It was his big fall from grace, and then he couldn't fucking, uh...  A few impressive injuries in there, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Injuries.  He, his concentration was off.  Uh, that's pretty funny.  What happened?  Well, Fishman's saying we should have a segment called Mars Madness.  Mars Madness.  Mars Madness.  What do you got on Tiger Woods? 
[00:10:30]  Tiger Woods?  He got another fresh piece of ass.  That's what it is.  You know what that gag...  Where's, uh, where's the picture of her?  Huh?  His name is Woods, not Tiger Woods.  He's excited to be helping us out a little bit.  Why don't you...  A lot of people used to say Donna Summers when it was just Donna Summer.  Right.  They were...  So, you don't know what to do.  Donna Summer.  I think I said that one.  Donna Summer, Tiger.  I watched yesterday, because they had a rain delay.  Yeah?  Yeah, they threw the fucking final round on the Golf Channel. 
[00:11:00]  Ho, ho!  What?  Is that her?  Who?  Is that Tiger Woods' bitch?  I didn't know her.  Yeah, no, she's alright.  Is she alright?  She's just alright.  How come?  She looks unbelievable.  Okay, that doesn't look that good.  See, she's just alright, but her body's unbelievable.  No, it's not.  You ever do any skiing?  Those thighs get fucking big, man.  Yes, keep talking, baby.  They get muscular, man.  Boaz loves it.  You like muscular, big legs on women?  Not like a bodybuilder, but like a skater.  But that's what...  Hell yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Look how big those thighs are.  That's right.  Oh, no.  She looks pretty good right there.  Because you gotta be in that tuck position a little too long, and that builds up the fucking  thigh muscles.  Those are big legs, man.  Joe, those aren't that bad at all right there.  They're big, muscular legs.  Thank you, Ed.  Get out here and get these girls going over the moguls.  And it builds up their big leg muscles.  I think his ex-wife is way hotter than the new bro.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not even close.  I gotta go be with you there, but she ain't bad.  She's all right.  She looks great.  I mean, if you didn't know she was famous, you'd probably give her about... 
[00:12:00]  That's a big fucking...  That's a man's ass.  What?  Look how muscular that thing is.  What do you think, Ed?  Well, I'm thinking, obviously, you're Hispanic, so you kind of like that a little.  Yes, I do.  But I think she's got a pretty nice body on her.  That picture in and of itself is not as flattering as the others I've seen.  That's pretty hot.  That's pretty hot right there.  She's got her panties halfway off.  Anytime a girl pulls down her bathing suit a little bit, that's a hot picture. 
[00:12:30]  Is she a rooski?  What is she?  Nah, she's...  Look, they're trying to hide how big their thighs are.  Fucking smash your face right down in there.  But I guess they're in love.  We'll see how that works out for them.  And she's, you know, if she was a...  Whoa.  She's like a seven.  All right.  Let's give her a seven.  I'm not bigging that.  I want to give her a seven.  Well, she beats the shit out of that Perkins, waitress.  Oh, God.  I've got to tell you that.  That pig. 
[00:13:00]  That fucking slob.  That slob.  With a plate full of fucking eggs and hash on her arm.  I love how all those bimbos, when Tiger finally broke up with his wife, all thought they had an actual shot.  Oh, yeah.  Like he was going to march into Perkins and carry her out like Officer and a Gentleman.  Get the fuck out of here.  You go, Perkins Waitress.  With all the other fucking waitresses.  Which is like clapping, dropping their dirty plates.  That only happens in movies.  Yes.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:13:30]  Officer and a Gentleman.  Marches into Perkins.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was going to happen.  He fucking puts a golf visor on her head.  Yeah.  We all knew he'd go high profile again.  Yeah.  All those bimbos out the fucking door.  They all thought, no, you know, when he finally cleans up his marriage problems, he's coming back for me.  He's coming back for me.  Yeah, all right. 
[00:14:00]  Tiger did it.  He's now officially number one in the world for the first time since, I'm going to guess, 2000.  It might be 2000, late 2010, early 2011, I believe.  What a guy.  It's been at least two years.  Two years that he hasn't been number one, I believe.  Probably longer.  Good for him.  Good for him.  And this Ricky Fowler, I'll just say this.  This Ricky Fowler, everyone wants him to start winning some fucking tournaments.  This kid, he's not much of a kid anymore. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know.  He dresses the part.  He's cool.  He's not a fuddy-duddy.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was a really good amateur, and he's very likable.  Fucking amateur.  And yesterday, you know, he's two strokes behind Tiger.  He's in the hunt.  And he fucking dumps two balls in the water.  Game over.  Oh, man.  Game over.  Were they tough shots?  Well, the first one he was going for, because he kind of had a...  Tin-cupped it? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  He had to push Tiger a little bit, so he went for it, and he had to get it over the water.  And as he said, he hit a little fat.  A little fat?  A little fat.  Yeah.  And that made it hit, like, on a slope, and then it rolled into the water.  Then he drops a ball and then dumps it in the water again.  It truly is amazing, when you're playing golf, how that water is just a mental intimidation  to get over.  If you're just fucking, you know, jacking a ball over some fucking fairway... 
[00:15:30]  Right.  It's all about air.  It's like, all right, that's okay.  But you see that water, and you're like, please don't go in the water.  Yeah.  Please don't.  Bloop.  Stop looking at the water.  Look at the air.  Right.  You just want to hit it in the air.  Exactly.  You're right, though.  Something happens to every muscle in your arms.  You just fucking freak out.  You get so mentally fucked looking at that water.  You're so right.  It could be a tiny little pond 20 feet off the tee box. 
[00:16:00]  I could fucking...  I could get a golf ball to go over a fairway, you know, on the fairway, and just go...  Not fucking clocking it, not setting records with distance, but I would be able...  If that pond was grass, not an issue.  Right.  I'd get it right over it.  Well, it's the same theory that Moses Gates was talking about yesterday.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like, look, you know, you could stand on, uh, what did he say, like, uh...  Yeah, yeah, stand on this edge of this console. 
[00:16:30]  Thank you.  Yeah, on this edge.  So you're not going to fall off?  Yeah, but now you take the edge of this console and put it a thousand feet in the air, you're  going to fucking fall off.  You're going to, for whatever reason.  You're going to be...  You're not even going to be able to deal with how you can't fucking stay on that thing.  And you made the point about a sidewalk and a bike.  Now...  You know how easy it is to ride your bike on a sidewalk and not fall off the sidewalk?  And you can stay on?  And, you know, you get bored and I've closed my eyes for a couple seconds, all that shit,  and you barely move to the right or left when you're going down a sidewalk. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  But like Ann said yesterday, now take that sidewalk, put it across the Grand Canyon, and let's  take the wind out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  No wind whatsoever.  99% of the people are going to dump their bikes.  Now try to ride your bike casually across the Grand Canyon on a sidewalk.  I would love to know.  We have to get like a doctor or a scientist.  I guess it would be more of a scientist.  Yeah.  To explain why that happens.  Your tire would be going...  Right.  What part of your brain decides to completely freak out and let you down? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  It's fucked up.  It really is fucked up.  I don't know.  So there you go.  You got the Tiger Woods at number one.  I know most people don't give a fuck about golf.  I love golf.  I love watching golf on Sundays.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  You're just chilling out.  You just lay around, and the pace of the whole sport is just perfect for your mood on Sundays.  Yeah, you don't have to feel like that huge excitement, that rush of excitement. 
[00:18:00]  You're just like, oh, that's a good shot.  You can socialize.  You can talk.  You can check your numbers.  Socialize.  A little of everything.  It's made for Sundays.  Nice.  So there you go.  Tiger.  You got the Heat with 27 wins.  Who do they got up next, Mars?  The Heat.  Now everyone's paying attention.  You don't know.  Boo, boo, boo.  All right.  I got my new TV yesterday.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yes.  And I...  What did you get?  I went with a 65-inch Samsung. 
[00:18:30]  Samsung.  Oh.  A Samsung.  Samsung.  Samsung.  Damn.  Mars is mad because I didn't use them.  Oh, well.  Hey, such is life, man.  I want to use Mars.  Help him out.  He goes, you've never used me before.  I go, all right.  Look into it.  And then he goes, well, when you buy the TV, give me a call.  I'm like, no, that's part of the gig.  That's part of the whole thing is getting the TV.  That's part of the gig.  I want the luxury of not having to figure out which TV. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Wait a minute.  You said when you buy the TV, then give me a call and I'll install it for you.  Then the next day, I came over and I showed you a bracket because you wanted to...  Brackets.  Install it, but I'm able to lift it.  Yeah, lift it up a little higher.  And it brought that to your attention.  Right.  You said, you know, okay, I don't have time right now to look at it, but thanks anyway.  Right.  And we left it at that.  Well, how was I...  I had to order the bracket online, too.  Yeah, you got to pull out your MasterCard.  No, man, that's not how it works.  You have to give me your business. 
[00:19:30]  These AV guys, they're specialists.  They show up.  You get an AV guy.  Perfect.  You kind of tell them a few things.  They suggest a few things.  And you go, okay, I want that thing.  And then they go, okay, Tuesday's the day.  Then they come over with that thing.  They install it all nice.  And you're like, thank you.  No money is exchanged.  And all of a sudden, a bill comes in the mail.  Great.  That's how I wanted it.  What are you going to be at the store?  It was so awkward.  And something, excuse me, what bracket would best be used for a 65-inch... 
[00:20:00]  Look, it all acknowledged, that's exactly how a lot of people do that stuff.  Yes.  But this is one of the luxuries I enjoy, because I don't know that shit.  So it's kind of nice to just have someone take care of all that.  Although I did install my own 90-inch with Vinny.  That was kind of, you know...  How heavy was the 90?  It was about 100 pounds.  That's it, right?  Yeah.  Because someone was asking the other day, because every time we talk about TVs, they were trying  to figure out which one of us had the TV that the guys rolled into the apartment. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was me.  Oh, right.  That was the old school.  And that wasn't even that long ago.  That was maybe 10 years ago.  Yeah.  That TV had to weigh at least 300 pounds.  And I don't think it was more than a 45-inch.  Jesus.  I don't think it was more than 45-inch.  Because it was the old fucking tube, right?  Yeah.  And that's about as high as you could go back then.  Yeah.  Unless you get into those crazy TVs that were like 100 grand at the time.  Yeah.  And these two animals pull up to my brownstone.  No stairs, really. 
[00:21:00]  Three, four steps down and then into the apartment.  And they rolled the TV into my apartment end over end.  It was so fucking heavy.  It still worked.  It still worked.  And I was a pussy and I didn't say anything to the gentleman.  I was a little scared that day.  Yeah.  Oh, you got all your little apps on the TV, too?  Is it a smart TV?  Yeah.  It's that TV right there.  But I never used a smart shit.  Oh, but you get Hulu.  You get your Netflix.  We've done the Netflix a little bit. 
[00:21:30]  YouTube.  But someone was telling me yesterday because I had these experts at my house, Mark.  Experts.  Big, huge box.  I didn't have to try to figure out how to get the big, huge box into my tiny little car.  I need capital.  You need a van.  If you're going to go into this business, you need a van.  No, I'm starting a business that I didn't know of.  Okay, but I need some capital to begin with.  I'm not asking you for it, but I'm saying to do these sort of things.  Sam understands, right, Sam?  I need capital. 
[00:22:00]  He came to me, bitch, and I go, all right, let's see if we can figure this out.  And then a couple days go by, and I'm like, what's going on?  I figured at this point he's going to give me some paperwork and some options.  He goes, well, I'm waiting for you to pick out.  I'm waiting for you to buy the TV.  You're looking.  I couldn't get a 65-inch into my car.  You're looking to go to a business that it puts TVs in your apartment.  Mars is looking for you to give him the capital to start a business,  and then he can put the TV in your apartment.  That's crazy.  It's crazy?  He's not trying.  This isn't Shark Tank.  He just wants a TV. 
[00:22:30]  He's not trying to invest in a business.  Right.  The American dream, you know?  Help me out.  We're better off just being casual like friends.  Oh.  We're friends.  We're screwed up again, huh?  Just text buddies.  No, no.  I can't do that, Sam.  Not even text buddies.  Not even text buddies.  Why?  He doesn't have my number.  Oh, that's a shame.  Him and Sal don't have my number.  Yeah, I got that.  I needed Sal for something, so I had to go through Sam. 
[00:23:00]  I don't have Sal's number.  He texts me.  He doesn't text me and go, hey, can I have Sal's number?  He texts me and goes, hey, tell Sal the da-da-da.  Yeah.  No, you don't want to be exchanging numbers with Sal.  No.  But you use the apps?  Oh, yeah.  I like that shit.  I was just using the Hulu one the other day on the big TV.  It's cool.  I was watching fucking Little Rascals.  Really?  Hilarious.  Holy shit.  Those fucking things.  They just did not care.  Those fucking things. 
[00:23:30]  Hal wrote.  Well, the shorts.  You know.  Talking about the actual things.  The actors.  How he got them little kids to fucking say some of that shit.  Oh, look at that.  Hal Roach.  He wrote it down and said, say this shit.  There's fucking scenes where kids are falling off of, like, chairs that they're climbing  on and they crack their head and they start crying.  And Hal Roach is just like, yeah, leave it in.  Fuck it.  And you know they actually hurt themselves.  Oh, yeah.  You could tell they weren't acting at that part.  But Spanky was hilariously funny as a kid. 
[00:24:00]  Not so much as an adult.  No, I didn't like the big pudgy Spanky in the later ones.  The little Spanky was always funny.  Right.  I wish Cotton was a monkey.  He's trying to turn fucking, like, Stymie's little brother into a monkey.  Oh, dude.  I don't think you get away with that anymore.  Oh, the blatant racism was amazing in those shows.  Yeah.  They had the Yum Yum Eat Em Up. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  That savage that was running around.  The fucking wild man from Borneo.  Yum Yum Eat Em Up.  He had a bone through his nose and a tail.  It's crazy.  They put a tail on him?  Yes, they did.  What the fuck?  Where was that kid's parents?  What the fuck?  Even back then, you had to know this.  I think there was something wrong with that.  There was a problem.  Some type of problem.  Did you get the 3D?  Yeah, I got the 3D.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you did. 
[00:25:00]  People aren't fans of the 3D, really.  I love that 3D.  You like the 3D.  And then they're talking about how people are disconnecting their, what is it called?  The iConnect?  Where they can look into your home.  With the camera?  Yeah.  Yeah?  On the, what gaming system?  Where people, what was it?  iConnect?  On, uh...  Xbox?  Xbox Connect?  It might have been that.  A lot of people are disconnecting that shit because they feel like, you know, people 
[00:25:30]  could just...  People just gonna fucking hack and look into your house?  I got you, yeah.  I have a camera on my TV.  And, uh...  And, uh...  You could be watching a show and then all of a sudden you get like...  You get a Skype message.  You hit it.  And now you're video conferencing with somebody.  Boom.  They're on your TV.  Yeah.  You're in a little picture-in-picture on your TV so you can see what, you know...  Yeah.  ...what you're all about and you do a little video conference.  Can I do that?  I would gather, yeah.  You should have a Skype app on your TV. 
[00:26:00]  Go back to the apps.  Don't have a Skype app.  You just set all that shit up.  Yep.  Holy fuck.  You set all that shit up and it's fucking great.  I got it.  I got it.  Paul comes in.  Hello.  We got to do some Skyping.  We do a lot of Skyping.  You're just sitting there jacking off.  Oh, hi.  Hey, how you doing?  Well, actually, we Skyped because it was Pop Pop's birthday recently.  Oh, well, that's different.  That's different.  And then, you know, and then we have a little piece of cake in New York so the little kid  could enjoy the cake they're having in Philly.  These are things you have to do when you have a kid. 
[00:26:30]  Right, Mars?  That's correct.  Well, you could do that on your TV.  It's like the future, dude.  The future.  It's like the second future.  I want to, you know, I turn on my giant TV and I see McFry!  And apparently I got fired because I made some deal with noodles.  Yeah, fax machines on the wall.  Oh, the fax machines just spit out papers that said, you're fired, you're fired, you're  fired.  I couldn't believe it.  So, Mars, I'm sorry.  Yes.  I realize I probably should have kept the TV talk.  Mars is just trying to jack you for business.  For one of your many days off. 
[00:27:00]  I should have picked that day to talk about my new TV.  Well, it's cool because, like, Sal and Mars are both, like, the new guys here.  That's why they wouldn't have your phone number.  The new guys?  Right?  The new guys?  I've been trying this shit for eight years, going on nine.  Damn.  This motherfucker still don't want to be my friend.  I got Anthony's telephone number.  Not that he gave it to me directly, but...  Well, I must have been intoxicated.  That's why I'm not giving you my number.  See how you brag about it?  Oh, man.  Some people just have my number. 
[00:27:30]  Who cares?  Anthony, the only time I tried it...  I got Anthony's number.  But the only time I tried it was only to let you know that you lost something.  Wait, you tried his number?  You remember?  Less shred of dignity?  No, no.  What did I lose?  Your badge.  Oh, when I had my...  I lost my badge in the elevator.  What?  You're a cop?  Yeah, you didn't know?  I just figured...  I figured, what the fuck?  I could be a radio guy and law enforcement.  No, I lost my Sirius XM badge.  Ah.  I had my backpack on. 
[00:28:00]  It's a fascinating story.  I leaned against it.  But then Mars goes, ooh, I get to try this number.  Yeah.  Hello.  I'm sorry.  The number you have reached is no longer in service.  Well, the text was, hey, Ant, is this you?  Remember?  Yeah, and then I texted, who is this?  See how excited you guys?  How long ago was this?  Maybe a couple of months.  He's just like, remember that time?  Remember?  Remember that fucking random, just number, no name text I got? 
[00:28:30]  And it was.  Just a phone number came up.  It wasn't in my phone like Mars.  Is it now?  No.  Let me see.  I'll be honest.  I'll tell you, if in my contacts it says Mars or not, I would have you on Mars.  And you've got to add the number.  Because you're like, I'm going to want to text this person again.  I might want to.  Let's see.  Mars.  Huh?  Huh? 
[00:29:00]  Huh?  Uh-oh.  Where's your phone?  Uh-oh.  Is it ringing?  It's in silence.  Oh, it is!  Oh, you got Mars' number.  I'm honest, bitch.  Yeah.  Look at that shit.  Mars, right?  I'm honest, motherfucker.  Enjoy that.  Enjoy that shit.  Yeah.  That's when the West Side Story music should have started playing.  Oh, man.  All right.  He's very excited.  Get the...  Oh, okay.  Okay. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Let's calm down.  A lot of left-handed presidents.  You were right.  Yeah, yeah.  Matt Bishop, thank you, sir.  I just got your tweet.  Bishop?  You got the Barack Obama left-hander.  George W. was a right-hander.  Bill Clinton, lefty.  Oh.  George Sr., lefty.  Wow.  Ronald Reagan.  Yes.  Left and right.  Left.  I'm ambidextrous.  You're ambidextrous.  Yes.  Mr. Gorbachev, I don't care what hand I use.  Yes. 
[00:30:00]  And you got the Jimmy Cotta, was a righty.  He was.  And then you got Gerald Ford, was a lefty.  Ah.  And then there's just a shitload of right-handers after that, including Kennedy and all that.  And then finally you go back to Truman was left-handed.  I didn't know that.  Oh.  And then it's not worth mentioning.  Next two more.  Herbert Hoover.  Yeah.  And I'm going to go with Taft.  Incorrect.  Taft.  Yeah.  That's my go-to president.  What's wrong with that?  He's right-handed.  That's what's wrong with it.  That's my answer to every presidential question. 
[00:30:30]  Ah.  Taft.  Who's the other left-hander?  Garfield.  Garfield!  Aw.  I used to love that comic.  Mm.  Not the cat one.  The one about the president, Garfield.  Oh.  It threw a lot of people.  Yeah.  I bought a book about, you know, Garfield comics.  And you're at the bookstore and you get it.  It's all about the president.  Oh, really?  That sucks.  The Garfield calendar. 
[00:31:00]  And it's all about the president.  Hey, what is this Amanda Knox?  Uh, it's supposed to be being retried.  Yeah.  Didn't she get acquitted in Italy and they fucking got her ass out of there real quick because  Yeah.  those Italian prosecutors and everything were really fucked up.  And now they want to retry her for murder.  But why the fuck would she go back?  I don't know.  I wouldn't go back.  That's a very good question.  I have no idea about this story.  Is she going to go back?  Oh, here it is.  Italy, Italy, uh, high court overturns, so they overturned it. 
[00:31:30]  Overturned the acquittal of Amanda Knox.  How do they overturn an acquittal?  It's like, fuck you.  I'm, I'm out.  The court ruled Tuesday that an appeals court in Florence must rehear the case against the  American and her Italian boyfriend or ex-boyfriend for the murder of 21-year-old Meredith Kircher.  Is she going to be tried in absentia?  Well, that's what I'm looking for here.  They ever go to absentia?  Wonderful.  Nice place, right?  Yeah.  Weather's great.  That's it.  They don't say how it's going down.  They don't say, because I doubt she would hop on a fucking plane and voluntarily go back 
[00:32:00]  to Italy to be tried.  She had a tough time there.  She's a cute girl.  Um, yeah.  She's alright.  Yeah, she's got a girl next door.  A murderer next door, look.  Look, I don't know.  I think she's guilty as fuck, to tell you the truth.  Oh, do you?  Yeah, I do.  Were you there?  Uh, no.  No, but, um, I don't care.  If a girl's cute and she wants to murder a little, you know, it doesn't bother me none.  I'd still let her in the jacuzzi. 
[00:32:30]  The appellate court hearing the case could declare her in contempt of court, but that carries  no additional penalties.  The Italian law cannot compel Knox to return to Italy.  She could be tried in.  Absentia.  Nice.  The word.  Absentia.  What does that mean?  They can find you guilty and then they have to wait for you to decide to take that vacation?  Yeah, to show up.  If all of a sudden she goes like, she's just standing there looking at the leaning tower  of P's and going, fuck!  Oh, I knew there was a reason I wasn't supposed to come here. 
[00:33:00]  Is that how that works?  Boy, you just crossed fucking Italy off the list.  You don't even go to an Italian restaurant anymore.  No.  You're just, I'm keeping it safe.  You're traveling somewhere and we have to make an emergency stop to refuel it.  Oh my God, the panic.  Ladies and gentlemen, nothing to panic about, but the aircraft is in need of some maintenance.  We're going to be landing at the Florence airport for you.  No!  Just fucking pull a DB Cooper and fucking throw yourself out of the plane at that point. 
[00:33:30]  It's just a routine detour for everyone else, except you.  Everyone looks at each other and goes, ooh, Florence, ooh, Italy.  Ooh, we could make a day of it.  Nice.  Ooh.  She's just screaming, no!  No!  Is that how that works?  I guess so, huh?  Yeah.  That would be fucked up right there.  She wouldn't even fucking want to be in that area of the world where they would have to maybe land there. 
[00:34:00]  Anything that looks like a boot.  No, she doesn't even wear boots.  Yeah, stay away from that shit.  But, and today is Hummus Tooth Day as well.  So, remember a couple weeks back that crazy day I had that I documented on this very radio show.  Where you, uh...  I'm putting all the pieces together.  You cracked a tooth on some hummus.  Well, yeah.  The whole side of it just decided to collapse.  Good thing you weren't eating something like applesauce.  Wow.  Thought there was a damn pit in the hummus.  Oh. 
[00:34:30]  Finally getting that, um...  The first part of the crown.  Yeah.  I've never had major dental work.  Not that this is major, major, but...  No, not really.  Just a bunch of cavities for me.  So what do they do, grind it down, shove some fucking lid on that thing?  Yeah, temporary lid, and then they fucking, uh...  Take the measurements, and they throw it through the computer,  and then you get the, uh, you know, the...  That goop they put on that fucking stick, and you got a bite down on it,  and it's just oozing.  It's making you choke. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  That's fucked up!  Well, it makes you choke, because you're all numbed up.  Yeah.  You can't use your fucking...  And your head's leaning backwards, and you got that thing in your mouth with the...  It's like this blue goopy stuff.  It makes an impression of your teeth.  Fuck, that's terrible.  Oh, is that what they're gonna do?  Yeah.  I don't even know.  Oh, it's an awful thing, Opie.  Yeah.  Yes, enjoy it.  I'm gonna enjoy it.  Today I got it done.  Oh!  James!  James!  Well!  Look who's decided to show up!  What's up?  Jimmy Norton! 
[00:35:30]  How are you, Jim?  I'm tired.  Look how skinny Jimmy is.  You say it every time, but...  He's getting thinner and thinner by the day.  Thin as a pin, Magoo.  So, we'll deal with that today.  How was your flight back?  It was good, man.  Yeah?  Nick Cannon was on my flight.  I'm like, who is this guy?  Nick Cannon!  But I didn't know who he was.  He was driving me nuts.  He was really nice.  Huh?  Yeah, yeah, no.  Yeah.  He's fake nice.  Another Nick that didn't want to talk to you?  Was that it? 
[00:36:00]  He's fake nice.  No?  He's not your boy.  You haven't talked to him since the big interview.  We've tweeted back and forth a couple of times.  Absolutely have.  Nope.  I like the caller segment on that one.  Huh?  I like when people called in on that one.  Really?  On the Nick Cannon one?  Nick Cannon.  Can they comment on his wife?  I think so.  He's a goofball.  Did you guys hear about this EMT thing?  Oh.  What happened?  Jimmy was tweeting about it.  Oh, yeah.  I was sure you were talking about it yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, we didn't get to it. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  I figured it was old news.  The EMT, he apparently was a fan of the show.  Was he?  Yeah.  And he had some racist tweets, as they say, as they call them, racist.  He had a picture, his profile pic was Hitler, and he had some anti-Semitic and racist tweets.  Yeah.  And, boy, they were onto him.  Found out, and he's suspended now.  The Post outed him. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  And somebody sent me a link, and they go, hey, what about this guy?  So I looked for a minute, and it said, hey, guy's real name is said.  So I'm like, fuck him.  He's a troll.  I didn't care.  And, you know, because another guy not using his real name on Twitter.  But I got such a barrage of angry response.  Yes.  And it was a bunch of, fuck you, you're this.  You know, so I just responded kind.  Fuck you, block, cunt, dot, you know.  It's all that to me.  Yeah.  But one guy said something that made sense, or that guy, he said something that this guy 
[00:37:30]  wasn't a troll.  He was just telling dirty jokes.  Like, he was, he was just, he was bashing the mayor.  He's playing a character.  But, I mean, he was just being a guy telling dirty jokes.  And I changed the way I felt about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that's just that PC shit.  There's a difference between guys who are just being dirty on Twitter and having fun.  Yeah.  The guys that are just going up and bothering everybody under a fake name.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I feel really bad for this guy.  It's like, of course, they suspended him.  And, like, the Post has nothing better to do but talking target fucking white people  telling dirty jokes.  Well, the Association of Black Firefighters in New York. 
[00:38:00]  As opposed, not to be confused with the Association of White Firefighters.  Right, there isn't one.  They were calling for this guy's firing immediately.  Of course.  Yeah, sure.  You know.  Why would they stand up for his right to be for free speech or to say things that they  don't like?  Why would they?  Yeah.  Why would they?  I guess he called Bloomberg King Jew.  Is that what he would call him?  King Hebe.  King Hebe.  Oh, my God.  Reserve its world, New York. 
[00:38:30]  Minutes, not hours away.  What?  Never before has so much.  Ooh.  Sounds like a great place.  Roulette, Baccarat.  Commercials on the Internet.  We all got to deal with them.  It's a whole new world out there, the Internet.  It's not like the old days.  You want to see porn?  Boom.  Porn.  There it is.  There it is.  There's a lot more to choose from these days.  Yes, there is.  I do enjoy it.  There.  Now we're ready for the clip.  I yapped through that.  The FDNY suspended tonight, accused of making racist remarks on Twitter. 
[00:39:00]  It is the second Twitter tirade by a member of the fire service in as many weeks.  CBS 2's Jessica Schneider reports.  Oh, if you're black, you could.  Is that one for property, please?  One for property, please.  EMS Lieutenant Timothy DeLujo's barely opening the door of his Staten Island home and refusing  to talk about the tweets that could cost him his job.  Oh, look.  A wow.  Oh, boy.  Did you see that?  The status of attitudes should not be.  Go back a little.  Go back to show his page. 
[00:39:30]  His avatar.  And refusing to talk about the tweets.  I see a wow over there.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  And then down there.  Up in the left corner.  Oh, boy.  Just waiting for them.  That's great.  Connect us to the story.  All right.  Well, they've already fastened me onto George Zimmerman's brother's tweets.  You made gawker.  I made gawker. 
[00:40:00]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Me and him were tweeting some things, and they were calling him a racist, obviously.  And then I get called racist by proxy because I'm commenting on, you know, legitimate statistical  information and other things about the Trayvon Martin case.  And then other high-profile or low-profile, based on mainstream media, cases that have been  happening in the news that are racially, either racially motivated or race plays some  kind of part in it.  And, of course, I consider it a win when someone just goes, you're a fucking racist, because 
[00:40:30]  it just, it takes the whole need to be educated about a subject out of the mix.  If someone can't argue one-on-one with facts, they throw racists at you and think that's  going to, like, make you go, hey, I'm not a racist.  And I'm like, well, all right, argument over.  I win.  But what about the fucking guy who shot that baby in the face? 
[00:41:00]  And it's a terrible crime, but it's like the racial component's not even meant, like,  if that was reversed, even if it was reversed, it's just a robbery.  Dude.  But if two white guys robbed a black woman and she'd give you money and she didn't have  the money and the one guy shot her in the leg and the other guy goes, I'll shoot your  baby.  And then walked over and shot the baby in the face.  It would be on the news right now.  It's all they'd be talking about.  It's all they'd be talking about.  You'd have Reverend Al and fucking Jesse Jackson and all the regular players up on the screens 
[00:41:30]  talking about how this is a horrible, obviously racially motivated shooting.  Now, they barely talk about the racial component, like you said.  Um, it's, it's the, the teen, the two teens, the two, two teens that, uh, did this.  They, they were robbing the woman.  They shot her in the side of the face and, and, and skinned her and then, uh, uh, and  then shot her above the knee and then just walked up to her stroller and pointed the gun 
[00:42:00]  in the baby's face and shot the baby in the face.  Shot the baby in the fucking face.  It's just, and it's no, it's no, it's not.  But yet the front page of the post is this fucking fireman telling dirty jokes.  Telling some dirty jokes.  Like that's your, what, what is wrong with us?  That's your dirty joke is much worse than a baby getting shot in the face.  Let's see the rest of the news story.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  That could cost him his job.  We think that someone with these types of views, with these types of attitudes.  Vulcan society. 
[00:42:30]  Doesn't look like Spock.  You should not be in the New York City fire department.  I am with the Vulcan society.  Live long and prosper.  And why couldn't a guy with those views fucking work in the fire department?  Why not?  If you pull up black firefighters' Twitters, I'm sure you'll find some pretty fucking inflammatory  shit.  And I'm not even saying you might.  I bet you will.  As a matter of fact, I'll look into that this evening.  Alongside a bottle of wine. 
[00:43:00]  Exactly.  We'll have answers tomorrow.  My bottle of wine and my anger.  That's what I sleep with.  Full report tomorrow.  For Dulujo's ouster.  Just days ago, he tweeted about the controversial police shooting of armed teenager Kamani Gray.  He was a perp and died like a perp.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Another message about Mayor Bloomberg.  He was.  That's how King Jew sees it.  Ban all guns and shooting will go down in NYC.  But it's the criminals with the guns.  Dulujo's Twitter icon features a picture of Adolf Hitler. 
[00:43:30]  And he.  And a wow.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Why didn't they pick up on that?  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Oh, my goodness.  This fucking makes me hate the media so much more.  It makes me hate them.  Fuck.  Oh, man.  Recently tweeted, a gold Nazi-era pin with a German U-boat and a swastika is my most prized artifact.  Just last week, Fire Commissioner Salasana's son, Joe, resigned from EMS after sending out offensive tweets about the poor, blacks, Jews, and women. 
[00:44:00]  Mayor Bloomberg says the tweets of two FDNY employees should not ruin the reputation of the rest of the department.  To blast them and to insinuate that they are something they're not, that they're racist or homophobic or whatever the case may be, I think is just an outrage.  That's not my experience.  Lieutenant Dulujo's works right here at EMS Station 57 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. 
[00:44:30]  But he's been suspended without pay for 30 days and his continued employment is under review.  In Brooklyn, Jessica Schneider, CBS 2 News.  The mayor says he just doesn't understand why people don't think before they tweet.  He warns city workers to be careful before they post anything on social media.  The man caught on camera sucker punched...  Girl's hot.  How is that fucking around forever?  Is this the man caught on camera who sucker punched...  Down in the fucking subway by Times Square, 42nd Street subway? 
[00:45:00]  What happened?  This fucking animal is standing there, and this dummy, who obviously doesn't want to insult anyone or seem like he's profiling, is just standing there.  And obviously the guy says something to him, and then you see the black guy kind of looks around and fucking clocks him right in the face.  And then robs him.  White guy?  Yeah, he was a white guy, and the black guy punched him in the face. 
[00:45:30]  Did they mention that in the story?  Why would they?  They show the video of it, but...  And again, it's just like...  And I said, I said, I go, I absolutely would have profiled that guy in the subway.  I would have, you know, profiled him and taken defensive action.  And someone goes, oh, so if a black guy says, uh, hello to you on the street, you pull your gun out?  Did I say that?  I said, I'd have postured myself differently.  I'd have walked away from him.  I wouldn't have let him get near me.  He looked like he was going to be a problem.  So I fucking would have gotten away from him. 
[00:46:00]  You could see it in his eyes.  He's looking around like, is someone going to see me?  And then, bam, punches him right in the face.  Oh, it's terrible.  But this guy's in big trouble.  This guy's losing his job.  I know.  He's losing his job.  That's the fucking...  That's the bad behavior.  The guy...  I was really happy I fucking followed up on that.  He was just a guy fucking telling dirty jokes.  Yeah.  And these fucking assholes went after him.  Yep.  How did the news get him? 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  Someone told me his tweets were protected, too.  I don't know if they were.  It was just more fucking...  More fake outrage by white people trying to scold other white people so their own fucking shit is concealed.  It's so irritating.  And now assholes like fucking Gawker are obviously trying to, like, put me in some position where it's like...  What are they saying about you over there?  Nothing.  They just added me to their page with Robert Zimmerman.  With George Zimmerman's brother.  And racist tweets. 
[00:47:00]  They were calling them racist tweets.  But meanwhile, you know.  When did this hit?  Yesterday?  Yeah.  You're on Mediaite, too.  Oh, Mediaite?  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  And there's mine.  Now, for no reason, they throw mine up there, too.  Well, what does it say?  Mine said, fucking white people.  Making black people do these horrid things.  We must change our ways so black teens won't do this. 
[00:47:30]  And it's a link to the story about the black teen that shot the white baby in the face.  What a great fucking tweet that is.  Yeah, it's just, hey, that's what it is.  There you go.  Because, obviously, that's the liberal thought process anyway.  So, you know, it should be making them happy.  I'm saying, come on, white people.  It's our fault.  We've got to do something.  And then Robert Zimmerman Jr., what, replied to that?  Is that how this is working on Mediaite?  And what did he write?  Well, his whole thing is he was comparing two pictures. 
[00:48:00]  One of the baby killer flipping the bird on some kind of social media.  And Trayvon flipping the bird.  And saying, like, this, these are the images.  And his point was, these are the images that the news doesn't show.  They always try to portray these people as these young, innocent, you know, wayward children.  When, meanwhile, they're thugs.  But then they catch on and say, why would Robert Zimmerman try to portray this murderer, child murderer, like Trayvon? 
[00:48:30]  He's trying to equate the two.  It's totally different.  It's like, no, he was commenting on the media and the media's portrayal of people  and not them actually putting them together and saying they're the same.  No.  That's what the media does.  It's like the media's like a big girlfriend.  Yes.  You never communicate well with them.  Right.  It's like when you scold them properly, they turn it around and they start talking about, like,  well, no, Trayvon isn't the same, even if you're attacking them. 
[00:49:00]  And they were calling him racist and saying he needs to apologize for trying to equate Trayvon,  who was a victim, with this killer who was, you know, a murderer.  It's like that wasn't his point.  How did they call you a racist, though?  No, they, Gawker hates me.  And they just put, they just decided to put my tweet up there also to try to drag me into it or something.  How do you know they hate you?  Nah, they've commented before on shit that I've said.  They're a fucking, they're liberal trash is what they are. 
[00:49:30]  So, uh, fuck them.  So, you know.  Fuck them.  I don't care.  I've never tweeted anything that I have to worry about or think I've stepped over the line.  I don't just tweet fucking, you know, hate speech.  I tweet fucking discussions that are based in race.  And people instantly call you out as a racist because, as a white guy, you can't discuss race. 
[00:50:00]  That's one of the biggest problems in this country.  You can't even talk about it.  It's astounding.  People should be supporting this, this, uh, Bluehost guy because, and again, I see a difference between him and a guy who's trolling other people.  There's a huge difference to me between a guy just fucking having a good time and telling nasty, shitty jokes.  Uh-huh.  And a guy purposely antagonizing people and then hiding.  Yeah.  So, I think people should support this guy and fucking, uh, you know, because people who want you fired call up and protest.  But people who don't want you fired don't call up and support you. 
[00:50:30]  No, they don't say anything.  They don't support you.  So, people got to start supporting.  If people who wanted him not fired were as vocal as people who wanted him fired, he wouldn't be fired.  Yeah.  He wouldn't be.  It really is, uh, we're in a weird place with this social media.  Wow.  There's really no First Amendment.  There really isn't.  You can't, there's no freedom of speech.  And it's not even, you know, protected speech.  You know, if you're inciting a riot or panic or something, obviously that isn't protected speech. 
[00:51:00]  But offensive speech is absolutely protected speech.  And, uh, they just throw that out the window.  But they say, like, well, it's just the consequences of it.  It's like, yeah, but if you hang a threat over something, then it doesn't just become the consequence.  You're, you're restricting what people can say because you're threatening them with, with, uh, some type of action to their, to their job or, or whatever.  So, you're really curtailing the freedom of speech with a threat, which isn't right. 
[00:51:30]  You know, people don't understand that people are free to offend you.  People are absolutely free to say shit that you don't want to fucking hear.  Well, the bosses are obviously looking at all this stuff.  Yeah.  And all these job sites, certainly.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It puts you in a bad spot.  That's why people make fake accounts and shit now.  Why do the bosses even care?  Like, who cares?  People talking shit around the water cooler. 
[00:52:00]  That's all it is.  Because you'll get interest groups that will contact the boss and say, we're going to, uh, protest or boycott your company because you employ these horrid people.  And, again, your, your free speech is gone because, uh, there's threats that they like to just call consequences.  It's for your actions.  But it's not really.  It's, it's, you know, you should be able to say whatever the fuck you want to say.  Well, it's the same nonsense.  Within the law.  Same nonsense we dealt with in radio.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  For many years.  We followed all the rules.  But as soon as you start, you know, talking about Asians or something, even though.  Oh, yeah.  Not breaking any, uh, rules.  Mm-hmm.  The special interest groups have the power and they go to the bosses and that's all it takes.  Yep.  It's quite similar here.  Everyone gets in trouble.  Everyone gets in trouble.  All right.  Why don't we, uh, take a break?  Yeah.  I got blown my nose.  We got Shane Smith coming in today at nine o'clock.  From Vice.  From Vice.  That should be a very good interview today.  Vice.  So, uh, there you go.  We'll be back.  The Opinetry Show. 
[00:53:00]  This is The Opinetry Show.  Cruising down the street in my 6-4.  Jock in the freeze.  Clock in the dump.  Went to the park to get the scoop.  Knuckleheads out there.  Cold shooting some hoops.  A car pulls up.  Who can it be?  A fresh El Camino rolling kilo.  Yeah.  Man likes EZA.  EZA.  He used to like EZA.  Oh.  Gangster.  That was fucking hilarious.  Died, uh, what, 18 years ago.  Wow.  20 years old.  Of the AIDS. 
[00:53:30]  Got to see the AIDS.  Was he, uh, was he on the down low?  Was he a down low brother?  I think that's what they hint at, right?  Yeah.  I believe so.  Yeah.  Mm-mm-mm.  Speaking of death.  Those Heaven's Gates people.  That was 16 years ago already.  What?  The Heaven's Gates.  Oh.  With that fucking UFO and the comet.  The Marshall White Apple.  Yeah.  Marshall White Apple, his name was?  Yep.  39 people.  Say, wow, we're waiting for the UFO, but we have to die first. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And then they hop on the UFO.  It's amazing.  You could talk that many people into something crazy.  Mm-hmm.  You could always talk one person into it.  Uh-huh.  39 people bought into that.  Didn't they castrate themselves and put on Nikes or some shit?  To the Nikes.  It was about the sneakers, too, for whatever reason.  I don't know.  I guess so they could run to the UFO as zombies.  Yeah, yeah.  So they could, uh...  And didn't they...  Didn't he castrate himself or something? 
[00:54:30]  Hail Bop.  Yeah, I think so.  How a Hail Bop.  Mm-hmm.  Hail Bop.  Bop, bop, mm-hmm.  Bop.  Yeah, comet Hail Bop.  There was supposed to be a spaceship behind it that was going to take them away.  But, uh...  Well, why do they have to kill themselves?  Does anyone remember?  Bop, bop, hail Bop.  Kill yourself with Hail Bop.  Why killing themselves, Travis?  You know, someone help us out with that. 
[00:55:00]  That part's weird.  The weirdest part of that is having to kill yourself, and then you get to go on the UFO behind the comet.  Oh, you know?  Well, as we all know...  As we all know.  It was the only way to evacuate the Earth.  We've all heard the story of Hail Bop comet.  Oh, so your soul is set free?  They were against suicide, but they believed they had no choice but to leave Earth as quickly as possible.  Yeah.  So the spacecraft was trailing Hail Bop, and he convinced his 38 followers to commit suicide so that their souls could board the aircraft. 
[00:55:30]  He got 38 people to buy into that.  How many people was he trying for?  Probably the whole world.  I don't know how many people were in his group.  He came up short.  Well, that's a pretty good percentage to get 38 people, though.  But I'm assuming he told the same story to hundreds.  He's no Jim Jones.  Yeah, I want to talk to those people.  The people that said, oh, man, I don't know, something's fishy here, or something doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  Yeah, 38's pretty poor.  I'd be like, you go first. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  I'm going to wait.  Right.  And what do they, drink the Kool-Aid?  No, they, um...  No, that was Jonestown.  What do they do here?  How'd they do it?  Well, I know, it was Jonestown, but I think they did some kind of Kool-Aid thing.  They made it easy for themselves, didn't they?  I don't think they fucking strangled each other.  They took...  Oh, they all had heart attacks at the exact same time.  It was a big natural incident.  They took phenobarbital.  Barbital.  Phenobarbital.  But then they mixed that shit in some Kool-Aid.  Mixed with pineapple, washed it.  All right, where's my fucking sorry? 
[00:56:30]  I knew it was some kind of Kool-Aid shit.  With vodka they washed it.  With vodka?  Yeah.  They called it a Saturday at Anthony's.  Phenobarb and vodka.  And they secured plastic bags around their heads.  Oh, why wouldn't you?  Oh, fuck.  Bag on the old head.  Holy shit.  White pineapple.  I don't know.  Does it taste good?  A $5 bill and three quarters in their pocket.  Said to be for the interplanetary toll.  Ah, come on.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with people?  Who listens to this asshole?  Was he joking at that point? 
[00:57:00]  Was he just goofing?  Let me see if they do this.  Yeah, and also we need a toll.  Yeah, we need a toll.  Why would they take American money?  And how do they know how much the toll was?  I don't know.  I mean, I guess he had been there before.  Don't pay the ferryman!  This was before E-ZPass, so...  Yeah, yeah.  So they had to wait...  You think the spaceship...  So you're going to have to wait in line with other UFOs to pay the fucking toll?  Yeah, basically, yeah.  Or you just have your fucking iPhone with you, and it's hooked up with that passbook. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  And you have your Hellbop spaceship passbook ticket.  You wave it in front.  It just takes it right out of your credit card.  Exactly.  They also wore armband patches reading Heaven's Gate Away Team.  Away Team?  Away Team.  Sounds cool.  Many instances to the group's use of Star Trek fiction.  All right.  I might have joined up because of that.  That's kind of cool.  I want to be part of the Away Team.  We want you to be.  Star Trek always cool, unless it's an IRS fucking parody.  Boy, they just aren't. 
[00:58:00]  IRS Star Trek parody training video.  It looked so bad.  It's horrendous.  It's so bad.  Yeah, the IRS spent a fuckload of money.  I swear to God, I thought you said IRA, the fucking Irish Republican Army.  You're like, what the fuck is that?  Irish Republican Army.  Everyone's, yeah, well, no, that would be Scottish.  Never mind.  No joke.  What is this about?  This, yeah, this is the IRS put together.  No, I know.  I'm just saying for the audience.  Oh, yeah.  The IRS put together some kind of a skit. 
[00:58:30]  Just to help you with your taxes.  Yeah.  You know, talk about taxes and tax cheats and things like that.  And they did it in the form of a Star Trek sketch.  I'm sure this is going to be terrific.  Which they paid a bunch of money to have produced and make.  And at a time when, you know, we're broke and our deficit's up and we're on sequester.  But how much money?  How much money?  I think it was like 20 bucks.  And do you hear about Biden's hotel bill?  Is that true?  What the hell is he ordering?  $85,000. 
[00:59:00]  Almost a half million dollars.  Is that true?  Probably for like security and fucking police escorts.  How about you don't go?  You don't need to be at all these places.  You really don't.  What was that for?  The Vatican shit?  Was it?  Yeah, I think it was.  For the Pope?  For the Pope.  We didn't need him there.  We could watch from afar.  Yes.  It really was a half million dollars, though.  Yeah, we could have fucking had a wall built.  So I guess the government's not that broke.  Or ripped down.  Because when you sit around like they do around here and go, well, you can't go see the Pope. 
[00:59:30]  Sorry.  Well, yeah.  We're on hard times and we could save that half million.  We could push it over here and do something nice.  Well, when you're the president and giving 500 million to the Palestinians and you're  giving 200 million to Jordan so they could take Syrian refugees, and meanwhile they're  shutting down air traffic control towers because of the sequester, the priority's a little  fucked up.  It really is.  As far as that goes, they're furloughing people, which means, you know, laying them  off for a couple of days a week, yet they're handing over millions and millions of dollars 
[01:00:00]  to foreign countries.  Why?  Why don't we take care of our own before we do it?  I understand we have to do that shit, but why not pull back and go, well, we got to  take care of shit here at home first.  And then we'll go back to giving you, you fuckers some money.  Especially during this sequester.  Or cut their number way down.  Yeah.  Something.  If our numbers are being cut way down and our monies are being cut way down, then you've  got to cut the, you know, the foreign aid.  It's fucking ridiculous.  And then you read that Biden, you know, it was a half million dollars to go check out the 
[01:00:30]  Pope.  That's why.  We didn't need him there in tough times.  If everything's running smoothly, go fucking see the Pope.  Enjoy yourself.  Dude, I could have went for a fucking, whatever ticket cost at a hotel room that could have  sent me.  I would have been nice.  Yeah.  You know the group of people he travels with?  You know the posse that the president and vice president has to travel with?  Well, I guess we're not that broke then.  Yeah.  That's how I look at it.  Then we're not that broke.  Yep.  It is enraging when you see money being wasted and people being laid off. 
[01:01:00]  It's ridiculous.  Taxes going up because they got to pay for shit.  Firehouses being closed.  Schools being closed.  All sorts of.  I mean, you know, you could, everyone could make their own fucking list and then you  get this dummy a half a million dollars to go see the Pope.  I mean, and that's one of many things you could put on that list.  That is kind of ridiculous.  I think air traffic control towers closing kind of important, kind of pretty important.  How much would it cost to keep them running?  I'm not sure.  But you know what?  If you could keep more than if you keep one open, well, certainly if you're worth the 
[01:01:30]  money, certainly you push that half a million that Biden just spent on hotel and travel.  Well, you certainly could keep a few of them open, right?  Keep them open for a little while.  How many?  Maybe a couple?  Sure.  For a half mil?  Maybe.  I don't know how that shit works.  But instead of now, they just said, well, the takeoff and landing is going to be the  pilot's responsibility to coordinate it with other pilots that are flying.  Oh, that's good.  I'm sure there's smaller fields and whatnot, but, you know, it's fucked up. 
[01:02:00]  This country's fucked up.  We've lost our way.  We really have.  Priorities are all fucked up.  All fucked up.  It's really strange.  And no one seems to really care.  It's a news blurb one day, and then everyone just goes, oh, what's the, you know, when's  Kim Kardashian having her baby?  Well, we all got our guns.  Let's do something about this.  Oh, well.  We'll follow you, Ant.  Let's go.  All right.  Charge!  But first, drink. 
[01:02:30]  We got all our goddamn guns.  Ah, shit.  Why are we stockpiling guns if we're not going to use them?  Yeah.  What is this 17-year-old fucking just?  Yeah, yeah, fucking app.  What is this kid about?  He just sold it for $30 million.  An app?  Yeah.  That's all it was?  I thought he was building some kind of company.  Sumley is called, yeah.  Sumley.  What does Sumley do?  He's 17 years old.  He just made $30 million.  $30 million deal.  Yahoo bought Sumley from this teen. 
[01:03:00]  He, um...  What the hell are we doing?  Fucked up.  She'd be in the lab just fucking figuring out how to...  Yeah, especially when...  Why go with Sumley when all Lee will be there sooner or later?  Yikes.  Sum's not all of it.  I want to know what Sumley does.  Sumley, uh...  What's Sumley?  Sumley?  No?  Yeah, it's just...  Yeah.  What is it, though? 
[01:03:30]  That it's worth $30 million.  Man, this shit drives me nuts.  It's a newsreader.  What are you talking about?  We have newsreaders.  What makes this one special?  It's just, I guess, because it's concise and it looks good.  It works on your iPhone.  You pick the sources you want the news to come from.  But that's sort of happening now.  Oh, so you customize it with what you want.  Yeah.  But we're all...  We're customizing already.  Oh, it's within one app.  Right.  It's one of the best of 2012 award from the app store. 
[01:04:00]  So you can customize your fucking iPhone or whatever and then flip through it and do that.  But you can just go to this app and be like, oh, let me look.  I got Flipboard.  Oh, yeah?  I'm not working out for...  I like Flipboard.  What's it do?  Does it change the front of your phone?  No.  It's just an app.  We need help on Summly.  Something's not right.  So you get all the...  I get it, but $30 million?  $30 million.  Wait a minute.  So what does it do?  Does it change? 
[01:04:30]  Like, if you have this on the front of your phone, you put everything into Summly?  No.  It's just an app.  Just one app.  You open it up and it...  What does it do?  And you get all these little tabs and then you can click on them and go to whatever news  source you have put in.  But my point is we're sort of doing that already.  So what makes this so much more special than what we're kind of doing already?  That it looks good.  It's worth $30 million.  Is it just the design of it?  Yeah.  It does it the best.  It's been a good design.  Well, wouldn't the companies get all sneaking?  Oh, this kid is doing this cool little Summly thing. 
[01:05:00]  We're going to make our own version of it.  I don't know.  Where's our tech guys?  There's a missing piece to the story, I think.  Well, there's that.  Maybe Yahoo does have a similar app.  All right.  And they bought his up so it doesn't compete, maybe.  Oh.  Maybe they're doing stuff like that.  But $30 million.  Wow.  $30 million.  That's a great payday.  Hey, Craig.  Not as good as the Powerball winner.  Oh.  That they put fucking. 
[01:05:30]  They just ruin your life.  That guy could never go home.  They say a lot of these lottery winners, they can never go home.  Yeah.  Pedro, they're calling him.  His real name Pedro.  His name's Pedro.  And then they put P-A-Y-D-R-O on all the papers.  And he won what?  $338 million?  Wow.  Fuck.  That's if you want to wait 80 years, I think.  But if you do the lump sum, I think they give you a couple grand.  Yeah.  They're fucking assholes.  That's nice. 
[01:06:00]  They make it look great in the paper.  But if you break it down, most people can't live to see the whole sum.  I think it's hit about $120 million he gets out of the $338 million.  But it's a $338 million Powerball.  Right.  Yeah.  Why should you only get $120?  So that's a third.  Well, a little more than a third in the end.  Because no one's going to do that.  What is it?  A couple hundred thousand a year?  No, you're not doing that.  For the next whatever years?  Ah, what the hell are you going to buy?  You give me a million dollars, a container of coffee, a nice hammock, I'm good. 
[01:06:30]  You guys do what you got to do.  What the hell do I know?  A hammock.  Like, I guess none of us would bitch if the $338 million turned out to be over $120 million.  Yeah, that's got to be nice.  Lump sum.  They say to these guys, yeah, they can't really go home because there's a whole bunch of people  knocking on their door going, all right, man, help me out.  It's a bodega worker.  Why the fuck would he want to go home, you know?  Where was that?  Passaic?  Passaic.  Passaic, New Jersey had it?  Yep. 
[01:07:00]  And some shitty bodega?  It was a liquor store.  Liquor store?  Yep.  Then you think, man, I sometimes go close to Passaic.  Why didn't I take the detour?  You do that shit.  Did he randomly pick the numbers?  Did he have it?  Yeah.  How many did he buy?  I'd love to know.  Did he play every day or was he one of these guys?  I'm sure he's a play every day guy, right?  Yeah.  Don't you think?  I have no idea, but.  Well, both papers went with Pedro, and the news I saw of Pedro also. 
[01:07:30]  Well, there you go.  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  Figured out somely.  You did?  And there is a twist, right?  Yeah.  There has to be for 30 minutes.  That's where the sum comes from.  In the summary, what makes it special is it has this algorithm that summarizes articles to 400 characters.  Holy fuck, is that a great idea.  So you don't have to pull through the whole thing.  And the reason I say that, I learned years ago from an old program director, he goes, two paragraphs, and you know everything in a story. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  So it's got all the topics that you like, and then the important articles come up.  And they get rid of all that nonsense shit.  It gives you the most important 400 characters in the article with this.  I mean, I don't know the technology behind it, obviously, but it says it thinks like a person.  Yeah.  How do they know?  How does the algorithm know?  Oh, please.  You really want that dumb thing making decisions for you?  And the editing, like, imagine the fucking information it will edit out.  You think something important.  You think the dumb news says two teens, two humans shot another human, a younger human. 
[01:08:30]  But you can read so much more shit.  And then if it's something that you really are into, then you can find the long version of the article.  And I'm sure through Summly, you can click and get a longer version, right?  Right.  You read the 400, and if it's something, the 400 character summary, if it's something you're interested in, you just push.  Just wrap your head around that.  And that is so obvious.  Why didn't any of us think of that?  I did, but I called it 400 character summary.  I didn't kind of roll off the tongue.  I keep reading articles because I feel like I'm missing something and I'm wasting time. 
[01:09:00]  And this thing is basically saying, no, you're not missing anything if you read these 400 characters.  And graphically, obviously, it's beautiful, too.  Man, what a great idea.  The kid was good for him.  $30 million.  Well, it's nice to see somebody that's 17 years old doing something, you know, that's actually helping the world.  That's actually a benefit to society.  Society.  Unbelievable, huh?  Society.  It's magical.  It's fucking magical, isn't it?  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  Oh, the Star Trek thing.  I knew we were going somewhere.  Oh, don't forget.  A high IRS.  Why didn't they do that?  Well, they probably did.  A high IRS.  They probably did.  Leonard Nimoy, 82 today.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday. 
[01:10:00]  Happy birthday.  There, right?  That's what we're doing.  A little Star Trek.  Do we want to see some of this IRS thing?  Yeah, we might as well.  Our tax dollars went to?  They spent a lot of money on this. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Educational or this promotional video.  Let's see what happened.  Play that shit.  Meow.  White boy.  His never-ending mission is to seek out new tax forms.  To explore strange new regulations.  To boldly go where no government employee has gone before.  This is so bad.  Captain's log, Stardate 8.23, why is Kirk Black?  We received a distress call from the planet, no tax.  We stole the enterprise. 
[01:11:00]  According to their leaders, the planet civilization has degraded to anarchy.  Chaos rules over order.  We've sent a landing party to assess the situation and report back.  Who thought this was a good idea?  We hope we're not too late.  On what planet is this a good idea, O.P.  reports from the lesbian party?  But it's difficult to hear, Captain.  There's poor reception.  Who is a lesbian?  Fascinating.  Oh, look at that horrible hair.  Can't you do something?  Attempting to modulate the frequency now.  Sorry about the uniforms, Captain.  The dry cleaner gave me the wrong order.  I think they're losing the time. 
[01:11:30]  The chip likes it.  It's better than McDonald's and only twice the price.  No can do yummy.  I've already spent my per diem for the day.  This guy's good.  Coming in clear now, Captain.  Shall I open a channel?  Yes, on screen.  This is so bad.  What the fuck is this?  What is it like?  It's thought tracking.  What was their point?  That they're trying to get across.  It's really long.  How many minutes is this?  Five and a half minutes.  That's way too long.  It's a training video.  For who?  Like employees, I think.  Oh, really? 
[01:12:00]  For IRS employees?  I believe so.  Well, I haven't learned anything yet.  No.  I haven't either.  I don't even understand.  Except the per diem is strict.  Is this a setup?  They're still in the setup stage before we start learning?  They want to make it fun.  I think William Shapner would do it.  That's not William Shapner.  Oh.  That's a black guy.  I'll give him a black guy to run the Reliant, let's say.  Yeah.  In Rathacan.  Jesus.  But the Enterprise, come on now.  Do you want to still watch this? 
[01:12:30]  A little bit.  I want to see when the first thing happens that is actually informative to the people that  would be watching this.  There's money laundering, bribery, cash pay, haircuts, and manicures running rampant in  the street.  Sir, they're even exchanging the lowest scoring currency for paper bills.  You don't mean...  That's right, sir.  Pennies on a dollar.  Chip loves it.  Hundreds to it, Lieutenant.  Good work.  We'll take that back to our next Executive Committee meeting. 
[01:13:00]  We'll get back to you.  That's good.  Sir, another member of the landing party is hailing us.  On screen, Lieutenant.  Captain, we uncovered a complex tax evasion scheme using several off-planet accounts.  It was a difficult money trot to follow, but in the end, we got it.  What kept you up, Connor?  An anonymous tweet came in.  Amazing what you can catch on Twitter these days.  Ah, okay.  I'm just doing it.  Good work.  So look at Twitter if you're... 
[01:13:30]  They're all calling in now, Ken.  So you're an IRS person.  Look at the Twitter for some leads on how to rat people out and turn them into the IRS.  Wonderful.  That's good.  Do you know how this video should end?  With a fucking locked door and a fire.  The fucking Happyland Disco.  These fucking vulture cocks.  It's terrible.  It makes no sense.  One more. 
[01:14:00]  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me now?  Uh-oh.  Go ahead, Emerson.  Alien identity theft has gotten out of hand on the planet.  Uh-oh.  So far, I've encountered at least a dozen new taxians.  With the same solar security number.  All going by the name Bob.  That's right, Captain.  And there's one more problem.  Uh-oh.  Interplanetary tax practitioners practicing without a license.  We asked one guy for his credentials.  And he showed us his movie ticket stuff.  Which movie was it?  Avatar 17. 
[01:14:30]  4-D.  Back in Russia.  Whoa, that was supposed to fucking crush.  That line was supposed to crush.  That was the big, funny comedy line.  Whoa.  You know when they presented this when it was first done and they went into their little  conference room and watched it?  That got a huge laugh.  You think they laughed and laughed and laughed?  Yeah.  You know, they love this.  Hmm.  What a terrible, terrible bit.  So just employees are watching this?  I guess. 
[01:15:00]  It's not going viral, huh?  The old House Ways and Means Committee had something to say about this one.  Like, whoa.  What the fuck is...  What the fuck are you spending money on?  Let's see what else we got on this.  We're only halfway through.  It's terrible.  One day I'd be rich and famous.  Me too.  That's why I became a public servant.  Oh, they fist bumped.  It would seem, Captain, that no taxions, lack of skilled tax leaders, has resulted in  a widespread case of confusion.  Spock is wearing Carvolta's hairpiece. 
[01:15:30]  No strategic vision.  I'm afraid without a wealth of skilled leaders, anarchy is spreading across the planet like  a virus.  How long before total anarchy?  Did you read for this, Jim?  I guess I wasn't good enough.  I didn't know what to do with my spot ears.  I just received an emergency medical distress call from the planet.  Chris, they're dying down there.  Some newfangled disease.  I've never seen anything like it. 
[01:16:00]  They call it the tax gap.  The what?  Tax gap.  Oh.  I don't know what it is.  Engineering, how fast can you get us the heck out of here?  Right, but Chris, what about the landing part?  Engineering, delay that order.  How fast can you beam up the landing party?  Why would he have to fucking, the captain was ready to leave the rest of the crew?  Captain, but more than that, she cannot do.  The walk corps is still recovering from last winter's frozen media storm.  We're drawing the engines as fast as we can. 
[01:16:30]  Another big laugh right there.  He's using a hair dryer.  That would be another solution.  This is great.  I hope fucking Paramount Pictures sues the IRS.  That would be great.  And fucking, yeah.  That would be awesome.  Sues the shit out of this fucking horrid ripoff of their product.  I kind of want to get to the end, but how much time we got?  Another minute 15.  Oh my God.  Do we do it?  It's worked.  It's fucking good.  All right.  Chip likes it.  Chip likes it.  You didn't think that was funny with the hair dryer drying the engines? 
[01:17:00]  Hilarious, Chipa.  I had to fucking stop that and rewind it.  Did these fucking cocksuckers drying the engine with a fucking hair dryer?  Fuck you.  Yeah.  We have found a gathering of leaders who could be of assistance.  They met back in the 21st century in Anaheim, California.  What?  First, sir.  That's perfect, Chris.  We can go back in time and bring the leaders into our century and pick up some tax gap vaccine 
[01:17:30]  at a local pharmacy.  Think.  The travel expenses in medicine could be itemized.  That's an idea, Bones.  You too, think.  Bones.  In fact, I'm grateful for everyone's contribution to this problem.  An engaged team and a successful team.  Someone like that guy makes a good weekly message.  Uhura, tell Scotty and Engineering to get us back to Earth as fast as they can.  Everybody practice and take your plans.  Bones is black.  They got it all messed up.  Shall I wear a speed cap to cover my ears, Captain? 
[01:18:00]  Nah, your ears are fine.  But you gotta loosen up, babe.  A little wee once in a while.  It's in order.  Ah, that was fucking good, man.  And that's why they went into that business.  Not a creative bone in their body.  Oh, nothing there.  Holy fuck.  Me and my mother went and saw that.  We went and saw that when it was in the movies. 
[01:18:30]  It wasn't in the movies.  Yes, it was.  And she goes, Chipper, you see, that's the good.  You don't have to be dirty to have good humor.  And then she blew the fucking guy that played Bones.  The guy that looked like the captain in Bones, they both knew my mother very well.  Oh, did they?  Yeah, I recognized them.  That's good.  Nice fucking waste of money.  Bravo.  Bravo to the IRS.  Good for them.  Fucking taxes right around the corner, huh? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Time to make some shit up.  Is that what happens?  Of course it is.  I just send all my shit to the accountant.  Yeah.  Time to make some shit up.  Send it all to them and have them fucking do it.  And then I get a bill.  Bill?  For three, four people.  I read the bills and I'm like, why am I sending this person a check?  Because we're lazy.  Yeah.  Well, I think it would be impossible at this point to do your own taxes.  Well, that's what they do. 
[01:19:30]  Of course.  They make it very difficult knowing you're going to miss a bunch of things.  I used to rock the shit.  And then it's in their benefit.  I used to rock the shit out of an EZ form.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, my God.  Was that great?  I remember those days.  One piece of paper.  Going to one of those fucking tax places you're done in 15 minutes.  I used to get the EZ form.  I bring it home.  Do a little math.  And then you open the book.  Do a little math.  Yeah, like, how much did I make?  Right.  All right.  Here's that.  Here's my deductions.  Right.  Which was nothing.  Right.  Just your basic standard deduction that you're allowed to take. 
[01:20:00]  And then how much did you pay in taxes?  All right.  I'll look at my little W-2 form.  All right.  I paid this much in taxes.  How much do I owe?  Let's look at the little chart.  How do I owe this much?  Now let's subtract that from that.  Ah, there's my refund.  Yay.  Now I mail it in.  Tricky money.  Yeah.  And wait fucking for my refund.  Now it's what?  I have them.  Ah, Anthony.  Hi.  Ah, it's Harvey.  Have you sent the GH4HQTL-B form? 
[01:20:30]  Not the A.  Not the A.  We're not using that since last week.  Right.  What?  What?  Could you even name four tax forms that they're using?  No.  I don't know what they're using.  Don't you love when you get the taxpayer's copy of what he did?  Right.  It's a fucking novel.  Well, the funny thing is they prepare all our taxes now, and it still takes almost two  hours to sign everything and initial everything. 
[01:21:00]  Just to sign it.  Hundreds of pages we get every year now.  Hundreds.  Hundreds.  I miss the days where we're flying under the radar and you could just make up all sorts  of shit.  Oh, you're just fucking...  I remember the first time I had to use the long form.  I had to go from the easy to the long form, which is pretty much the same thing as the  easy, but instead of just the standard deduction, you're allowed to deduct a few more things.  A couple extra things.  Horse with a clock in its stomach.  I know we've talked about...  I miss Clown Guy.  Government allows you that.  I miss Clown Guy, but he never put me at ease because he always would say, well, let's 
[01:21:30]  let's see if this goes through.  Let's see if this goes through.  As he's wearing a clown nose.  I was using Anthony's guy.  If you pulled up to that guy's fucking front door, it was a red flag.  Really?  Yeah.  Fuck.  He wound up dying.  I know.  And a lot of people got out of a lot of tax trouble because of it.  Really?  Yeah.  Apparently, if your accountant dies, they can't really hold you responsible for things.  And he died a little young, didn't he?  Maybe.  I don't know.  What the fuck? 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  What's that about?  They can tell you you owe more money and shit like that, but you can't really get in trouble.  Clown Nose Guy.  An office full of clowns.  He would put his nose on because he thought that was hilarious.  And then he would...  Fucking hoot.  He'd make up a few things and then he'd put it on a pile and go, well, let's see if this  goes through.  That was his little joke.  See if this goes through.  He really...  In the end, he was on the up and up, but he never put you at ease.  I liked him.  Not at all.  I liked him.  He was a nice guy.  You know, it's just... 
[01:22:30]  I don't know.  What?  I couldn't imagine trying to fill it out.  Because there's so many little things that have to be fucking deducted.  And if you miss one, that's a lot of money.  Yeah.  And the deductions aren't even like regularly.  It's like, how much of this deduction are you even allowed to have based on this other  form?  There's a math thing.  Like, fuck that.  I get it from different states because of gigs.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be insane.  Dude, from fucking Massachusetts, from fucking California. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, fuck.  And they'll sign...  Like, a lot of these places just take my taxes out.  I'm incorporated, so I'm supposed to pay at the end of the year.  But a lot of these places now...  Because I think entertainers are beating them and just not paying them.  You lose that fucking tax money before you leave the gig.  Oh, they take it out?  Take it out.  And a lot of times you get it back if that's all you made in the state that year.  Like, you know...  Right.  A lot of times you do get money back.  But who the fuck can...  That's what...  You've got to have the accountant.  I can't go over everything.  How much do I pay in Massachusetts?  Franchise tax board. 
[01:23:30]  What the fuck does that mean?  I write so many checks to weird quarterly franchise tax board a lot.  There's some that are so shady sounding.  Like, I feel like I'm writing them to a guy.  Yeah.  It's so weird.  It's a racket.  It's a racket.  They know the average American's going to fuck it up and it's going to be in the IRS's favor.  A lot of times with the state, you're dealing with a receiver.  And they won't catch you if you're cheating, you know.  The receiver of taxes.  You've got to send, like, them.  And it's their name. 
[01:24:00]  It's like, too, you know, Bob Williams, receiver of taxes.  It's like, now you've got to trust that this guy's going to do the right thing.  I always like to look back in time and I wonder who was the fucking asshole that started this shit to make everything so complicated.  Yeah.  There was a time people didn't have all this shit to worry about.  No.  And then someone had to get their little dumb nose in there and they started off with this tiny little thing that led to this huge, complicated world we now live in. 
[01:24:30]  I don't think it was a little nose open.  I think it was a big one.  Big fucking.  What are you with?  The fight department.  My brother, because he's a big time day trader since he left Wall Street.  Yeah.  He showed me the boxes that come in.  Holy.  His tax return is, it was almost as tall as me.  It was almost.  Oh, stacked up in like.  It was at least five feet tall.  That's crazy.  At least five feet tall of boxes that arrive at his house and he has to go to the bottom box to sign the last form, basically. 
[01:25:00]  Because he day trades his ass off.  Every trade is documented.  Every trade, yeah.  And every trade that's documented is some kind of paperwork and they send it to you in the end.  There's also how long you held a stock.  All that shit.  That's so complicated.  Depends on how long you held it to how much of a percentage of capital gains you got to pay.  Right.  It's just fucking insanity.  He's still in that day trading world.  God bless him.  Does he do it himself or does he have an accountant?  He's fucking, he knows his shit. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, the taxes?  No, I'm sure he's got a tax guy at this point.  I don't know how he would be able to do that himself.  You have to.  Yeah.  So.  They fucked the tax law up so much that you need the tax guys.  Well, when Wall Street got all fucked up, he was, he survived for a while when they were merging and this and that and companies folding.  And then he finally got the boot and he started day trading and make ends meet.  And he's had many offers to go back and he's like, it's not worth it.  Yeah.  Those guys don't make as much money as they used to.  And it's not worth the fucking, you know, stress of doing it and commuting from where he was. 
[01:26:00]  So he's like, no, I'm staying home.  Fuck it.  It's easier this way.  Yeah.  Cause they really knocked the shit out of those guys over the last few years.  Yeah.  Good or bad.  I don't know, but they certainly knocked the shit out of them.  Yeah.  That I know for sure.  I'm fucking real.  So.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  You want some strawberries?  They're not that great.  No.  Fruit sucks this time of year.  Yeah.  Does it?  Yeah.  I bought some fruit, some, uh, it was a fuck. 
[01:26:30]  I'm going to talk about a strawberry that has a little fucking, who cares?  I'm just going to talk about a strawberry that had some fuzz on it.  Even though I saw, I'm talking about it now.  Shut up.  Why were the police after it?  Fuzz.  Strawberry.  One of the strawberries went bad.  I saw the guy take it out of the big box.  You know, he was stacking the shelf.  So I'm like, this has to be safe.  So I didn't even look at him and there was a fuzzy one right on top. 
[01:27:00]  I hate a fuzzy strawberry.  It's the worst.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than that.  Wow.  This windows is so weird.  What do you mean?  Sometimes you try to close a program because it's fucking up and you can't even close it.  Like I'm, I'm in task manager and I click on that and I'm like, end task.  And the, and the program's like stops sort of halfway.  And then it just appears again.  I don't know what's happening.  I hate the task manager. 
[01:27:30]  Nothing's working.  Well, let's go to England.  Shut it down.  I got a nice little story out of England.  England?  Yes.  A school in England.  This is a great little story.  Hip hip.  Cheerio.  Yeah.  All that sort of brotch.  What are you going to do over there?  Have tea and crumpets or something?  English chip.  Are you looking at that?  It's an English muffin or something.  We got 12 people that listen to us in England.  Really?  Saw the numbers the other day.  12. 
[01:28:00]  Australia, we have people that listen.  We got 89 in Australia.  High.  And we got four in Ireland.  Wow.  Three.  Crank it.  It was 88 Australia.  Oh.  Messed up the number.  One went from Australia to Ireland.  So we had three in Ireland.  That fucked up.  That fucked up all.  I'm too tired to mess up.  A school in Essex is banned.  A school in Essex.  A school in Essex.  A school in Essex is banned.  Triangular flapjacks saying they're too dangerous. 
[01:28:30]  Has banned triangular flapjacks.  Are they pancakes?  Pancakes.  They make everything sound so romantic over there.  They're fucking pancakes.  A flapjack.  Flapjacks.  A school in Essex has banned triangular flapjacks saying they're too dangerous.  Dinner staff at Castle...  Very much.  Thank you.  What?  A school in Essex has banned triangular flapjacks saying they're too dangerous.  Dinner staff at Castleview School in Canvey Island were told to cut the treat into squares 
[01:29:00]  or rectangles after a pupil was hit in the face by a flying flapjack.  What?  Stop.  I don't understand this story.  A triangular one that's poking people's eyes out?  They get hit you in the eye.  Is it like fucking Chinese stars?  Well, that's dangerous.  Yeah, but...  I never got good at throwing those fucking things.  They would always stick into something, but...  Yeah.  My heart sucked.  It could be accurate.  That doesn't look like a flapjacks.  What is that?  It must be a British flapjack.  Oh, British flapjacks.  What the hell's a British flapjack? 
[01:29:30]  Are they more like scones?  They're retarded.  I like a good scone.  Do you?  I really do.  What's the difference between a scone and some motherfucking...  You can't shove a flapjack into your ass and cum.  Oh.  But a good pointy scone.  Scone's a bit dry.  Oh, oh, that's different.  And a little less on the old calories, although...  Right.  Not so much if you go to Starbucks.  Holy fuck.  I think it's like 640 calories for a scone.  Mmm.  Yeah.  In England, a flapjack is like a cake... 
[01:30:00]  An oat cake.  An oat cake.  Oh, Jesus.  Terrible.  How about they just ban oat cakes?  I would have a cancer pastry and an oat cake.  You don't want an oat cake?  Oh, God.  Does that sound good to you?  An oat cake?  No.  Like a granola bar.  No.  It sounds terrible.  Oh, by the way, you know we're doing Friday Initiative radio shows now?  There's a sushi joint in Long Island.  They say they're the best sushi joint on Long Island that wants to bring sushi by Friday.  Really? 
[01:30:30]  What?  I don't know.  That tweet went by, I don't know, 12 hours ago, so I don't know where it is.  Where is it located?  Somewhere on Long Island.  But I guess they've been voted best sushi or something.  Good for them.  Well, I wanted you to try that tuna sushi pizza.  So, I'm telling you, I wouldn't steer you wrong on this.  The thing is, you're not going to like, if you don't like it, you don't like it, but  it's not going to be a horrible experience to you.  But then I'm going to be stuck here while, you know, everyone else is eating some, and 
[01:31:00]  I'm just going to be like, oh, well, I don't like that.  No, we'll get all the shit for you.  Oh, good.  You ever have tuna sushi pizza?  No, I've not.  Oh, it's so delicious.  Really?  It just sounds like a fish taco.  Yeah.  I don't want a fish taco.  They use the pizza dough, I mean, and that's about it, as far as, you know, looking like  a fucking, or tasting like a pizza.  Yeah.  But the tuna's sliced nice and thin.  Nice.  A little onion.  Yeah.  Some capers on there, a little spicy mayo, not just enough.  Onion-y.  Not too onion-y.  Onion-y.  You give me a regular slice of pie from Domino's, that's all I eat. 
[01:31:30]  Slice of pie, a container of Coke.  Oh, God.  It's containers.  What do we got for Friday's show so far?  Nothing, right?  No, nothing.  Damn it.  Maybe Mars has a talent.  But we had Sal's talent last Friday.  What was Sal's talent?  Drumming.  We could have Mars put together a nice Friday show.  You want to hear Sal drum?  I'd love to.  I'd like to hear Sal do anything.  It's not very good.  I enjoy Sal.  Sal, you want a drum for Jimmy?  Oh, boy.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  You want a drum for Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yes.  All right, let's get the drums in.  I'd like you to play the shotgun trigger with your toe.  Can you play that?  It's going to be the third day in a row we set up the drum set.  Oh, God.  For the third show in a row.  He's going out to get it.  Okay.  He's not.  And then I got in trouble.  You missed so much.  Because there's a douchebag that works here.  That's why you say there's a microphone in this building.  Well, after all these years, I thought I had all the douchebags figured out. 
[01:32:30]  I had to add another one to the list.  Do we know them?  Really quickly, I decided to put Sal in the elevator for that dumb elevator show, drumming.  That's funny.  It was all right.  We went up and down a few times, and we got in some trouble with building security.  Yeah, of course.  But all of a sudden, but this fucking douche from Sirius XM shows up, because I guess somehow  he's involved with the drum set.  I still don't even know.  And he was scolding all of us, and his famous line was, on what planet did you think this 
[01:33:00]  was a good idea?  I'm like, where do you work?  Do you work for Sirius XM, where you try to think out of the box and fool around a little  bit?  Douche.  And then we had to go into a secret room, which is behind this secret wall, which leads  to these secret elevators, and we were just about to get away with it, even though the  guy's like, follow me, and he's grabbing the drums aggressively, all fucking pissed.  He's trying to make eye contact with me.  I'm like, I'm not dealing with you.  Are you kidding me?  Who are you? 
[01:33:30]  Anyway, and then we were about to go upstairs and be safe, and then they said the supervisor  wants to talk to you for the whole fucking building security, so I'm like, fuck.  And then this guy's looking at me like, I finally got him.  I got this guy.  He obviously doesn't like us, me, or the show.  And then the supervisor comes in.  I'm giving you the short version.  There was way more to this, which was kind of funny.  And he looks right at me, and he goes, first of all, and I'm like, oh, fuck here.  I got to deal with this shit.  He goes, I'm a big fan, and puts his hand out and shakes my hand.  And at that point, as I'm shaking his hand, I look at the douche and give him a nice smile 
[01:34:00]  like, fuck you.  You're not getting me this time.  So what did he say?  Look, just give me a break with this.  You can't do it.  And I was cool.  I was like, you know, we were trying something.  We fucked up.  We were trying to keep it from going.  The problem was we went all the way down the lobby, and they had two elevator banks out.  So we were causing a major fucking issue for the building.  Very funny.  But, so I said, look, you know, obviously I showed respect, sorry.  You know, we were trying to do something on the higher floors.  We fucked up a little bit.  Obviously, we won't do this again. 
[01:34:30]  Thanks for being cool.  And the whole time, the guy from here was seething.  He was so mad that I wasn't in real trouble.  And the guy here, does he work for a channel?  Yeah, I guess.  I don't even know what he does.  He mixes, what, all the bands and stuff?  Yeah, he's in charge of all the studios and equipment.  What a guy.  He thought we were going to bring the drums outside.  He goes, it's 20 degrees out.  I'm like, you don't even know what we're doing.  We're doing a stupid bit in the elevator.  Yeah, he was a.  He goes, follow me.  I'm like.  I'm not like an idiot.  I'll follow the guys that are forcing us not to use the regular elevators anymore. 
[01:35:00]  I'm not following you.  What planet?  What planet do you think this was a good idea on?  Oh, God.  How old are we?  What planet?  That was a good insult right there.  Right.  Come on.  I would have said just planet Earth and then scolded myself.  Oh, literal Earth.  We went.  We went with planet fun.  Just to be real.  Planet fun.  Planet fun.  Right.  Yeah.  Back to triangular oat fucking cakes or whatever they're called.  Oh.  Flying flapjack. 
[01:35:30]  Our correspondent, John Brain, has been finding out more.  When does a humble flapjack pose a threat of physical harm?  Answer.  Answer.  When it's baked in the shape of a triangle.  When does a humble flapjack.  Susan Johnson's butler, this guy sounds like.  Miss Johnson is in the library.  The library.  That guy is the best.  Susan Johnson.  Yeah, Burt Johnson's butler.  Oh, God, yeah.  Answer. 
[01:36:00]  When it's baked in the shape of a triangle.  It was during a food fight at the Castle View School on Canby Island that a pupil was hit  in the face by a three-sided flapjack and had to be sent home suffering from a sore eye.  Hey.  Well, after that incident, the school says it held a review of the shape and the texture.  Hey, do these assholes know that squares have fucking points, too?  Yeah, four of them.  They have more points that could hit you in the eye.  So why would they take out the triangle and say you have to make them into squares or rectangles? 
[01:36:30]  It's sharper.  Yeah, but a point.  It's a more acute angle.  I get that part of it.  Yes.  But a point.  Look, here come the drums again.  Oh, God.  It's stupid drums for the third show in a row.  Oh, with fucking Sal.  I've got to deal with Sal and his mediocre drumming.  That'll be after the break.  He's got to do the in the air tonight, or did he sort of? 
[01:37:00]  No, he didn't.  He didn't.  Okay.  The school says it held a review of the shape and the texture of its flapjacks.  And it's decided from now on, the triangular one is banned.  And the only safe shape for a flapjack is square or rectangular.  It's not a flapjack.  Some people believe the school's decision was a little, well, half-baked.  How dangerous would you say that is?  On a level of one to ten, zero.  So what do you think of the school banning them?  I think it's ridiculous. 
[01:37:30]  Absolutely ridiculous.  What is that?  Nothing going on in England?  You don't have to be told not to be trying the food.  Clearly, this is a very dangerous implement that should be blocked away and kept out of  the way of children, because obviously there's going to be quite a few injuries with something  as dangerous as that.  That's the joke.  There is a sharp point on there, but I would have thought it's the same point that's on a  square one, to be honest.  Oh.  It's ridiculous.  It's nuts.  Absolutely ridiculous.  Square one at 90-degree angles.  And for child to be sent home after being dead by one of those. 
[01:38:00]  Blimey, don't know shit.  The casualty of the flapjack attack has made a full recovery, but the triangular version  of this snack is now off the menu for good.  Wow.  John Brain, BBC News.  Do they really need to do two minutes on that?  Two minutes on...  They really got into it.  Would they just call it something else?  A flapjack is a pancake, and we all know what that is.  Right.  A wonderful, fluffy, soft, round thing.  That's more kind of like a granola bar.  Yeah.  That's granola-ly-ly. 
[01:38:30]  Terrible.  Granola-ly-ly.  That's a terrible story.  It was horrible.  I wouldn't want to ban those for any reason.  Like, even if they said, once again, a young lady had a flapjack pounded into her vagina.  It was pounded with a mallet, and she's dead.  They still shouldn't ban them.  Of course not.  Fourth one this week in the same school.  It was pounded up her bum.  She was found in an alley with a flapjack in her vagina, and one in her anise, and two 
[01:39:00]  in her mouth.  Semen was found on the flapjacks.  Many people want them banned for this.  Yes.  But one school is making more than necessary.  So the ones used in rape-slash-murders don't interfere with children that want to enjoy them.  They are now to be fashioned into the size of a nice, round, soft penis.  Circular foods only. 
[01:39:30]  Circular flapjacks.  You can put them up your bum.  But they won't cause any type of cutting or injury.  Injury.  You can put a hole in them and wrap your penis in them.  Those look terrible.  Oh, they look awful.  All lumpy and fucking hard.  I don't think I'd be eating those any time soon.  They're called spark ears by the children sharing laughter.  Would you like to have a spark ear? 
[01:40:00]  Can be heard being shouted across the common food area.  Those English are weird fucking, weird sorts.  Hey, you got any spark ears?  There's a girl here I'd like to rape and murder.  I need something to pound into her vagina.  It's shaped like a gun.  Well, we got a lot of drums outside the studio getting ready to be set up again. 
[01:40:30]  Why not?  Are we adding any drums today?  I'll make sure that...  Let's add something.  Let's make his kit a little bigger.  The full kit, yes.  Let's get even more stuff he could pound on.  Yeah.  Also, we got X-Pac basically fucking up his asshole.  Yeah, I mean, that's what he did.  With some flapjacks.  There was a flapjack.  China put one on her clitoris and he sat on it.  It's now in his rectum.  His bloody rectum.  X-Pac falling on hard times and now he's fucked up his asshole. 
[01:41:00]  We'll tell you the story next.  His comment was, rectum?  I don't even know him.  It's a TMZ story.  Yes.  I'm sure Harvey Levin had a lot to say about that, right?  Or was it more just questions?  Well, it was X-Pac tore his anus.  What do you think?  Would you have pulled off a move like that?  Oh.  Jesus, Harvey.  What are you doing?  Ass blood in the fucking ring would have been great, though.  And I want a Fandango update next, too.  Okay.  I got one.  But we're going to also play drums for the third day in a row. 
[01:41:30]  And I don't want to react improperly, but I got a text from Matt Bishop who says, or a tweet,  that the Michael Mears show went after me at the 43-minute mark of last week.  Is this still Don and Mike, guys?  Well, I've been getting that tweet off and off for about a week now.  But Michael Mears, I don't even know what we ever fucking did to him.  But, I mean, is that true?  I have no idea what we did to him.  What's that?  He did.  What did he do?  What did he say?  They were talking about Jimmy Fallon taking over for Leno. 
[01:42:00]  Right.  And then it somehow got into a discussion of comics, and Jim's name came up.  And he was just still pissed at you for being ONA's attack dog back in the day.  How was Jimmy ONA's attack dog?  Yeah, I didn't like those guys either.  What are you talking about?  We fought our own battle.  And we're totally cool with Don, by the way.  I have a clip if you want.  I don't have a bad thing to say about Don.  And Mike I never really socialized with.  He helped promote when I was doing antisocial with Attal and Brewer, myself and Bill Burr in D.C. 
[01:42:30]  And they said he didn't want me on his show.  So I was like, all right, whatever.  This is some bad blood from the old days.  But what, do you want to start up again?  I haven't fucking said a bad word about you in ten years.  And you want to start up okay for years.  Let me hear it first.  I don't want to be a dick for no reason.  And when Don lost his wife in that horrific way, we went on the air and said,  Don, Don, we're done with this.  We're not fucking going to fucking make jokes about that shit or anything. 
[01:43:00]  And we actually just said, we're done.  We're not, we have no issue with him anymore.  That was the catalyst to say, you know what, time to fucking move on.  That was a long time.  That was eight years ago.  I think that was when we first got back to satellite or back to radio in general on satellite.  Yes.  You got the clip?  Yeah.  It's 52 seconds.  Okay.  What is he doing?  A podcast?  I don't even know where he is.  He's got the Adam Carolla deal where when CBS flipped the format and let the show go,  he got everything and can do commercials and all that stuff. 
[01:43:30]  And he started his own little network.  But it's only internet, right?  Yeah.  It's only internet.  Oh, good for him.  But good for him.  But I didn't even know we were still battling with those guys.  Well, I guess we haven't had one of these in a while.  So if that's what he wants to do, feel free.  Let's hear.  Yeah.  There it is.  Will you take Jimmy Fallon over Jimmy Kimmel?  No.  No.  I think Jimmy Kimmel is number one.  You're right.  I think we all agree on that.  But from what they have to choose from, when I watch Leno, even when Jim Norton is on,  and I enjoy watching Jim Norton, even when he's on, 
[01:44:00]  Big fan of the Don and Mike show.  Leno.  Jim Norton.  Thanks for referencing that.  Look, I'm giving you my example.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I'm just saying that you just opened up a wide list.  Pause.  What the fuck?  Why would he say big fan of the Don and Mike show?  He's not a regular on your...  He was never a regular on your show?  Oh, he's being sarcastic.  Oh, that was...  No, he's being sarcastic.  Like, thanks a lot.  No, he's...  He was...  There was some seriousness there.  No, no.  The guy who...  There's a guy in there who likes me. 
[01:44:30]  And he said, I like watching Jim Norton.  And the one guy goes, big fan of the Don and Mike show.  Thanks for opening that wound up.  Like, he's saying, like, obviously, I'm not a fan of the Don and Mike show.  But it sounded like he also was expecting some kind of...  All right.  Oh, no, he's being sarcastic.  Yeah.  Oh, go back.  I'm sorry.  That was slathered in sarcasm.  Yeah.  Yeah, I missed...  Then I missed something.  I'm watching drums being set up.  I was just saying, what happened here?  Go back.  Sorry.  Yep.  Big fan of the Don and Mike show.  Leno...  Jim Norton. 
[01:45:00]  Thanks for...  Thanks for referencing that.  Look, I'm giving you my example.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I'm just saying that you just opened up a wide wound.  And Leno, I think, is...  You know that Jimmy Norton was Opie and Anthony's attack dog for Don and Mike.  I'm giving you my play-by-play.  Son of a bitch.  So...  Pastured.  Maybe they should give him the Tonight Show.  Jimmy Norton?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then the...  Tonight.  The Tonight Show is brought to you by Hordes.  Whores with VB.  When I watch...  When I watch Jay Leno, I feel like he's a hack. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  I agree.  That's it.  We agree with that.  So the only other option is either...  That's not bad.  That's what it was said.  That's lame.  That wasn't that bad.  That's not bad at all.  But you weren't our attack, dog.  What are you talking about?  We were all...  All three of us were in on that one, man.  Yes, that's not...  I don't understand the people that just hate Jay Leno.  That's...  I don't get it.  I don't care if they hate him, but when they say it, like...  Like he's a hack and stuff.  I don't find him to be a hack.  It's just ill-informed.  You might like someone better, but yeah, he's not a hack.  He's pretty damn edgy with his shit every night. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  I've never argued...  If a guy thinks he stinks and they don't think he's funny...  You can't argue personal taste.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  But when they throw around words like hack, it's like...  It's far from a hack.  It's an incorrect term to use for Jay.  If you don't like him, don't like him, but don't...  That's like saying, ah, Leno, he's a dumb Puerto Rican.  No, he's not.  It's just...  You can hate him, but don't say something that he's not.  He's not a hack, man.  That's one thing Jay is not.  None of those guys are hacks.  None of them is not a hack. 
[01:46:30]  No, no, no.  They're fucking doing...  They're doing seven to ten minute TV monologues every night.  Crazy.  You know how hard it is?  Comedians fucking work...  And this is across the board.  All these late night guys.  It's hard to do that shit.  But you work for fucking years to put together a seven minute set that you can do on The Tonight Show,  or you can do on Letterman, or you can do on Kimmel.  Yeah, yeah.  And these guys are doing...  And I know they have writers and stuff, but it doesn't matter.  They're doing fucking, what, five nights a week times seven to eight minutes? 
[01:47:00]  35 to 40 minutes.  35 to 40 TV clean minutes.  That's brand new a week.  That's not hack.  That's not even close to hack.  That's really fucking hard to do.  That's a talent.  If I had writers, I could do...  No, you couldn't.  Yeah, the writers make it easier, but...  You still got to deliver it.  Your jokes still bomb.  You got to deliver it properly.  Yeah, but that's not the definition of hack, my God.  That's a fucking talent to survive that.  35 to 40 minutes of stand-up a week.  Hacks are the guys on the road doing the same.  Yeah, brand new TV clean. 
[01:47:30]  I could say 40 new things a week on TV that are clean, but they wouldn't be funnier jokes.  Right, they still have to be funny, a little edgy, all that shit.  I was in a store the other day.  I bought something and paid for it.  Wow, we moved on from the Don and Mike thing so long ago, this is sort of a surprise.  That wasn't bad, though.  Hearing that, that's fine.  I think it's just like, yeah, your name came up.  Yeah, I wasn't.  He remembered the past.  There was nothing about you now or that you're, you know, a asshole.  Sponsor about wars with VD, that's acceptable. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's fine.  Does anyone know how the Don and Mike war started?  Something to do with us switching...  I'm going to guess something about switching times with them.  But that was not...  Yeah, they decided to move our time slot.  Okay, yeah.  That was a big deal.  That would have pissed us off, too, if that happened.  Because they wanted...  Don and Mike wanted New York, I think.  And we were on...  So we took the drive time in D.C.  Well, we all had the same boss, Ken Stevens.  Yes.  So Ken was now going to work the Washington station, the New York station, the Philly station. 
[01:48:30]  And Ken Stevens was trying to build, like, kind of a lineup that he could kind of throw on a whole bunch of CBS stations.  But the problem was you had us that we were doing extremely well in New York, and they were doing extremely well in Washington.  So someone had a budge.  Yeah.  And they decided at the time, because the New York market was bigger, that Don and Mike would have to move.  That's what they decided corporately.  Right.  And that's what started the whole fucking thing.  Sports guys! 
[01:49:00]  I'm a sports guys!  Worst jingle ever.  Because then they moved them to...  What?  Iraq?  Middays, I guess?  Because then they had like us on after us.  So it was middays, but they...  They got middays in all the markets.  And then we got the afternoons in all the markets.  Do you know, even though we attacked those guys and they bashed us, there was one moment I felt really bad for them back at N.E.W.  It was...  We had a lot of bad blood.  I just...  I don't remember what it was.  And it was either Don or Mike, I don't remember, who was walking out of the N.E.W. studio. 
[01:49:30]  And he tripped and fell.  And it was hilarious.  It's always funny when someone falls, right?  Always funny, yeah.  No matter who.  Yeah, even if they're carrying plutonium, it's funny.  But he was either...  Again, Don and Mike, I don't remember, stood up and knew that he had just been seen to fall by the show that he didn't like and that didn't like him.  And he just had this like...  Like look on his face. 
[01:50:00]  And I just kind of looked at him and I was like...  I laughed, but I was like, I kind of want to fucking hug him right now.  That's truly embarrassing.  That is, yeah.  This guy really felt bad for him.  Like, oh, that's...  Like, I would hate to fall in front of a show that I was arguing with.  Right, right.  Because you know they're just loving it.  I know.  He could not have tripped in front of a bigger bunch of cunts than us.  I'm way past that.  Don's retweeted some of my shit.  I've retweeted some of his shit over the last few years.  I have no issues.  Yeah.  None.  None whatsoever. 
[01:50:30]  That's so long ago.  I'm glad that wasn't bad because I would have...  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to fucking fight with those guys.  Whatever.  It's exhausting.  Well, the drum set is almost set up again.  Again.  The third show in a row.  I don't know why I find that funny.  What song are you going to muddle through today?  I think I got an angle today.  Yeah?  A little bit.  I think I might have something.  I got to set it up during the break.  But I think I might have something.  All right.  When we get back, Sal plays the drums for Jimmy because Jimmy did not hear. 
[01:51:00]  And X-Pac tore his butthole.  Yeah.  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F-U line.  Here's the latest batch of F-U's.  Fuck you.  Thank God you got rid of fucking Danny's voice.  Fuck you, Danny.  Fuck you.  I like to say fuck you to anybody who doesn't listen to Opie and Anthony.  This show rules.  Listen to it. 
[01:51:30]  Or fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to my stupid bitch tits.  I can't even look in the mirror without seeing the creases underneath my titties.  Fuck you, bitch tits.  Fuck you.  The biggest fuck you to the emergency room nurse that had a parade everybody through the fucking ER  while she fucking cut my cock ring off with a Dremel tool after a night of Cialis partying and passing out.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to Daniel Bobo Curlin for fucking getting all caught up with this Katie Corliss shit 
[01:52:00]  and just shitting up Twitter fucking every five seconds and making me fucking interested to read this stupid shit.  Uh, Bobo, fuck you.  Fuck you.  This fuck you goes out to Opie and Anthony for doing this story about Brooke,  the 20-year-old that looks like she's four when Jimmy's in L.A.  I wanted Uncle Paul's opinion on this, you fucking cocksuckers.  Fuck you.  Sam, shut the fuck up. 
[01:52:30]  No one wanted to hear your annoying bitch.  Shut up.  Travis, you fuck.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  I just had Chessa the hooker.  It's all your fault, man.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to my ex-girlfriend.  She gets a job.  She goes down to work every day with my dad's best friend,  60-year-old broke man cleaning his house,  and all of a sudden she's coming back with fucking owing money  and all fucking hyped up.  Turns out the fucking cunt was fucking smoking crack with some 80-year-old man, 
[01:53:00]  and now she's fucking living with him.  But to top it off, I have no kids with her, no relation,  gave her fucking a place to live for four years,  and you know what she does?  She brings me to court trying to get money out of me.  Fuck you, Shonda.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony at 866-SU-LINE-1. 
[01:53:30]  That's 866-SU-LINE-1.  Easy is his name and the boy's coming straight out of Compton.  It's a brother that don't smother your mother  and make your sister think I love her.  Easy E day.  You decided, huh?  Yeah.  You like the Easy E.  How do you not like Easy E NWA?  NWA was all right.  Anthony is partly unavailable.  Yeah, he's taking a dump.  Yeah, he's dropping a fucking horrible duties. 
[01:54:00]  Jeez, that's right.  It's Steven Tyler's 65th birthday.  It should have been Aerosmith Day.  That's old shit.  That's old shit?  Yeah.  Easy E's been dead for 18 years.  What are you talking about?  What's new by Aerosmith that's good?  Yeah, I don't really.  I like a few songs.  I don't even disagree with you, Rocky.  He's right.  Yeah, I like a few songs.  There was a little controversy during the break.  What happened?  I don't know.  Oh, there's something about the fucking FU line. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, I forgot already.  Yeah.  Sal, what happened?  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Eric played an FU line from like two, three weeks ago.  You said he was an idiot, right?  Well, yeah.  You yelled he's an idiot, and then E-Rock yelled back at you.  No, it was Travis that he's a fucking idiot.  Yeah, I mean, I sent the email to Travis and Eric saying it's loaded into the system,  ready to play for tomorrow, and Eric played one from...  Two weeks ago?  Ages ago.  That's stupid.  E-Rock?  I didn't see an email.  I'm not doubting that he sent anything, but I didn't see an email.  Did Travis get the email? 
[01:55:00]  Oh, look at Sal.  He's got the upper hand today.  This is really strange, right?  Turnabout is fair play.  This is very strange.  Stupid.  Well, we got the drums.  Yeah.  And I was talking to Sal during the break.  I asked him if he knew System of the Down, and he picked a song.  Oh, yeah?  What song do you want to play by System?  Toxicity would be a good one.  You like that one, huh?  Yeah, it's an awesome one.  Huh?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hopefully, hopefully I can pull it off.  I gotta remember all the patterns.  What about the fucking Dave Grohl?  Huh?  Oh, you want to do Foo Fighters? 
[01:55:30]  No, when you fucking...  Let's see.  What's the other song?  The fucking...  No, it's...  What's the band that...  Yeah, what song is that?  Tura Lura Lura?  No.  Dave Grohl played Queens of Stone Age.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know that?  Oh, that'd be awesome.  No One Knows?  Yeah.  No One Knows is good.  Yeah, that's a good song, yeah.  You want to play that?  You want to start with that? 
[01:56:00]  That's an easier one.  Yeah, let's go.  All right, let's try that.  Oh, easy.  All right, we'll start there.  Oh, all right.  So, all right.  Well, it starts with drums, so I'm going to have to catch the first beat.  Uh-huh.  All right, you want us to play the song?  This is for Jim Noren.  Jim Noren missed you playing the drums.  Yeah, I like drummers.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Ready?  Yeah.  Let's go. 
[01:56:30]  We get some rules to follow  That endless is endless  No one knows  We get these pills to swallow 
[01:57:00]  How they sniff  In your mouth  Tastes like gold  There you go  I'll see when I catch like that  It'll pop  No one knows  I'll realize 
[01:57:30]  You're mine  And we have  You're mine  I'll realize  You're mine  And we have  You're mine  All right  All right 
[01:58:00]  That sounds good  It's so easy to beat up Sal, but that's fucking amazing  It sounds good  I don't know how the fuck you know every beat of a song like that  That wasn't bad  I was offering a few things, but I was just trying to go by number  But it's close enough for me  It wasn't bad  Yeah  But he had pretty much every fucking  No?  Yeah  I think so  Yeah  All right  Drumming's a weird fucking skill, man  That's a hard, hard thing to do  I think so  Most underrated guys  Bass players are the most underrated guys  But drummers just lurking in the back  Behind everything 
[01:58:30]  Like fucking  Like child molesters  Behind the shrug  Weirdos  It's a rough gig  That's pretty impressive  Yeah, like fucking Lars Ulrich  When you see him  He's like hunched over  Because he walks with a bit of a hunch  From all those fucking years  Of being bent over drums  And beating the shit out of them  Right  What about  Can he play Toxicity here?  Toxicity's gonna be a tough one  Why?  You said it in the hallway  Yeah, yeah  You're the one that picked that one  Yeah  There's some patterns in there  I'm probably gonna forget  But I can give it a  Is he a good  Who's the drummer from  Physicians?

I think we have a few minutes  Before Shane Smith comes  Oh, my God  Dude  We usually  Don't  We try not to talk  About wrestling a lot  Unless something happens  Unless it's a big story  That goes, you know  More mainstream  Right  So X-Pac is wrestling  Where?  In a fucking high school gym  Somewhere?  Yeah, I think it was in Minnesota  Where he's from 
[02:18:30]  He's having a tough time, isn't he?  He's not getting the big call  From Vince to come on back  For one more run, right?  I mean, he's not in shape  To do another run, either  Jeez  Guts hanging out of his  You know, singlet  He really let himself go  What's his issue, you think?  China  Well, I mean, he had  You know, you remember  The interview I did with him  A while back  Not really  What?  Where he was fucking  Talking about  Trying to  Make it sound like  You're fucking, you know  You're fucking David Frost  With Nixon  You guys were blown away by it  He was talking about  Trying to kill himself  And doing drugs  Yeah, that's what 
[02:19:00]  That would happen  The guy's bag  And fucking China  Wow  He's had a lot of issues  You got all that out of him?  He's doing better now  Way better  Except, at the moment  His asshole is torn  He ripped  His asshole  How do you tear an asshole?  Bronco Buster gone awry  But how?  Yeah  How does that happen?  If you hit your asshole  Hard enough on something  You can split it?  I'll tell you what  You look at that fucking  Turnbuckle  And you'll notice  There's padding on the  On the turn  Where the ring rope turns 
[02:19:30]  Sorry  But you're not  Sal's working with a hot mic  Oh, that's a hot mic  You didn't learn anything  From Denny, did you?  Oh my god  Denny says  He'd be so pissed  Oh man, would he be mad  His aunt's in the middle  Of an explanation  And maybe a bit  Or a joke or two  And Sal's working  With a hot mic over there  Sorry  See, that's padded  But then there's that  Actual turnbuckle bolt  Right  That's uncovered  His asshole  Hit that thing directly  It's like he jumped up 
[02:20:00]  And landed square  On a fucking  One of the tightening bolts  And he's done this movie  I mean, this is a movie  Oh, I thought it was  Like a fucking bar thing  No, no, no  Oh no, that's his finishing move  He was famous for this move  In WWE  All those times  He didn't break his asshole  But the one time he does it  In, you know  Podunk, Minnesota  Oh man  It's the time he breaks his asshole  Do you have it?  Yeah, I do  Oh, I see it  I think the old  WWF rings  Had padding  Even on those parts  Of the turnbuckle 
[02:20:30]  They do  If I recall  So they got lazy  So they got lazy here  There's no padding on that  So he came down  With his asshole  Directly on one of those  Big turny bolts  Yeah  Ow  You can't see the blood  Because apparently  There was a lot of blood  And he had to get  Asshole surgery  Damn  I tried to get him  On the phone today  But he didn't text me back  No, huh?  Why?  We finally have a reason  To talk to him  Get on our fucking show  And talk about how you  Split your asshole  His asshole probably hurts  Alright, but  You know  He's cranky  He's tearing the ass  Out of me over here  I'm X-Pac

Yeah, you can see it mouthed it out  He goes, I'm hurt  He tells Jerry Lynn  That's Jerry Lynn in the blue  Oh, a ref tells him?  Yeah  And then Jerry Lynn's now  Got to do a move to X-Pac  They'll take him out of the match  Oh  Oh  Horace has one of the toys  Horace has the ladder  I don't know what Horace is  Oh, he's going with the outside  Why wouldn't you just leave the ring  Yeah, how about I just say  Look, I just fucked up my asshole  Sorry  And I'm just waiting 
[02:22:30]  To see any hint of blood  Look at his  Oh, God  Look at that gut  Oh, no  He has to get thrown out of you  He's been known to come back  To the announce table  With a sore asshole  But why do they keep it professional at that point?

That's the guy I've seen  Welcome  Nice  I've seen you in some very weird places  Holy shit  Yeah  It's fucking great  I was  I was blown away  Man  Just like  It's like  With other shows  That people go  To far away  Dangerous places  You get this feeling of safety  I don't know why  But you do  You get a feeling like  You know  You see somebody 
[02:31:00]  That you've seen on TV  For a while  They go places  And you kind of know  Behind the cameras  You feel like it's all  On the up and up  Something  Yeah  Like the authorities  Are all cool  Everyone's in on it  Like yeah  No problem  But wow  With yours  Not so much  No  You know what  Advanced planning  It feels like  It feels like  Yeah  A late night beer run  Where you know  Anything could happen  And it usually does  Yeah  Very cool  I mean  What was the first  What was the first place  You went  Where it was like 
[02:31:30]  Hey this will probably  Catch on  The first big  Big story I ever did  Was North Korea  Alright  Which was  2007  And  Is it a pain in the ass  To get there  Yeah  It was a real pain in the ass  We had to go to  Xinjiang  Which is in northern China  And just wait  And then they have  This weird  North Korean bar there  And  And they're singing  North Korean propaganda songs  And you're sitting there  Going I'm really tired  I just want to go to bed  And they're like  If you don't get up and sing 
[02:32:00]  And like get into it  Like they're not going to let you in  And so I'm up there  He's singing  I'm doing a pantomime  And I know this is radio  But  And  And then  So then I went back to the hotel  They're like  Okay we're going to  We're going to get you at noon tomorrow  And like  Then you know  5.30 in the morning  Come we have to go now  Now  You know  Because they never tell you the right time  Everything's always the wrong time  And there was like  20 people trying to get in  And only four of us got in  And  It was this big kerfuffle  Because they were like  They knew I was a journalist  But they kept saying  Don't say you're a journalist  Whatever 
[02:32:30]  But I'm like  That's the North Koreans saying  You know I'm a journalist  You know  So we were real nervous the first time  And then we  We met these generals there  At the one hotel you can stay at  And it's the one place you can do karaoke  And we got drunk with these generals  So  We went back the second time  And then we were allowed to shoot  Wait wait  The first time you went in  So what do you go to the DMZ  Or  How do you say  Okay I want to go into North Korea  Yeah  You  Well  You have to go to Shenyang  And apply in Shenyang  At the time you had to go in Shenyang  You could only go in  During the Airy Rang Games  Which is the Mass Gymnastics 
[02:33:00]  Which is the largest  Stadium in the world  And they have 150,000 people  Doing you know  The human pixels  Yeah  That's pretty cool  The boards and stuff  And they do the history  Of the Korean Revolution  And there's like  There was literally me  And like 11 other people  Sitting there for 150,000 people  Doing the show  And  But yeah  So we had to  We had to wait in Shenyang  And sort of bribe some people  To get in  The second time  We were allowed to go in  With visas  It's scary though  Because like  Who is the filmmaking team 
[02:33:30]  From China that they liked  Or whatever  Like they can just keep you  Yeah  It's like to get you out  The US would have to invade  You don't leave now  Yeah  They could literally keep you there  If you offend them  Yeah  And so we were nervous  About getting out  And then we had  Put up a documentary  And then when we went back  The second time  We were really nervous  And then this last time  They call us the Dirty Dozen  I have no idea why  But they're like  Oh we know you guys  The Dirty Dozen  You're not coming back in here  Wow  Yeah  So they won't let you in  A third time  No no no no 
[02:34:00]  They won't let me  What's your thoughts  On North Korea  What were you surprised at  When you got to see it finally  I mean it's like  Going back in a time machine  That's what I hear  It's like going  It's going back to like  Soviet Russia  Or Maoist China  Where it's just  100% cult of personality  Sort of communist  Utopian society  And you get  It's like a Disney  Disney experience  For you know  Political science  But it definitely  Messes with your head  Because every advertisement  Is for them 
[02:34:30]  You know  For Kim Jong-il  Kim Il-sung  Every room has them  Like Big Brother  Like two pictures  Every room  Every person wears  Their picture  Their little button  Above their heart  And the people are like  Oh are the tears real  You know  Of course they're fucking real  Like I don't know  Of course they're fucking real  Because they've been told  It's like Jesus  And Lincoln  And you know  I don't know  God died  Like you know  Like that's what  They've been told  Since their kids  Why wouldn't they  So they  Of course they  Totally buy into it  And there's no other 
[02:35:00]  There's no media  Yeah  Right  So they're just like  Yeah  They are God  And North Korea  Is amazing  Everywhere else is shit  To the  Oh that was  You answered my question  Probably  They seem happy  Well you don't meet  This is the thing  You don't meet  A lot of real people  Everything is  You have secret police  You have  You have  Guards and guides  And translators  And everything's  On a tour  This is why  We wanted to  Go in a different way  In this last thing  We did  Was because  You can never 
[02:35:30]  Actually meet people  In fact  I went to Siberia  To meet real North Koreans  Because they have  These slave labor camps  In Siberia  Where they make  Little North Korean  Villages  And then they  They have slave labor  There  Well they have  North Koreans  Which is essentially  Slave  And they work  In Siberia  And so we went  To talk to some  Of them there  And that's  The only way  We could ironically  Talk to North Koreans  Was going to Siberia  We can't get a bus  Trip together  On this radio show  We can't get  Two buses  To take us somewhere  And you get into  Fucking Siberia  And North Korea  Amazing  It is amazing 
[02:36:00]  What you can do  If you have people  Working for you  And know what they're doing  And you were responsible  For Dennis Rodman  Going over there  Right?  Yeah  When we were over there  They take you to this place  Kim Il-Song's  Palace of Treasures  And they say like  So it's every  You know the gift giving  Is a big thing there  And so  Like every state  Has given them  Like oh here's an ashtray  Or here's a whatever  And so they have  And so they have these  In this museum  That's like 23 stories  Down into a mountain  And it's got trains  And shit down in there  So like a train  That Stalin gave them 
[02:36:30]  And stuff  So it would take you  Something like two years  To see every one  Of the treasures  If you spent ten seconds  On each treasure  Anyway  The centerpiece of this thing  There's two centerpieces  One is this room  With Kim Il-sung  And Kim Jong-il  Wax statues  But like kind of  Shitty ones  With like a fan  Blowing their hair  And people  They go into the room  And they literally  Fall down  Crying  Like freaking out  Like losing their mind  And I was like  What's going on  And they're like  Oh well they're so ecstatic  To meet the leader 
[02:37:00]  And I'm like  Well they're not  They're not meeting the leader  That's a wax  That's Madame Tussauds  And he's like  No they're meeting the leader  And so they would be  Overly emotional  That was the big one  And the other one  Was this  This sort of dais  With this basketball  I'm again doing a pantomime  This is this basketball  Which was like  Signed by Michael Jordan  Right  And Madeleine Albright  The first sort of  Like you know  By-party talks  Between America  And North Korea  After you know  The Korea war  And everything  Was Madeleine Albright  And she brought this  Gift 
[02:37:30]  This you know  Basketball  Signed by Michael Jordan  So they hate America  Want to go to war  With America  But the Chicago Bulls  Are like  Are like  You know  This sort of  You know  Texas Rangers  They're sort of like  The greatest  You know  Most heroic  Beautiful people on earth  And you're like  What the fuck  Doesn't make any sense  But how many people  Get to see  The Chicago Bulls games  Over there  Zero  I know  That's why  It's so confusing  That's why I say Texas  Right  I was trying to come up  With like a mythical  Yeah  But only good thing  You know  Fantastic  You know  Thing  They're Batman and Robin  Whatever they are  But nobody knows 
[02:38:00]  But nobody knows anything  About them  And you don't see  Any games  Or anything  But Kim Jong-il  Had all of their  Games on tape  He has all these  Big theaters for himself  He has eight  Big cinemas for himself  So he  He has all the games  So the Chicago Bulls  And that basketball  Are kind of legendary  In North Korea  Because you have to go  To this  Palace  Of the fucking treasures  To see  You know  The thing  And the basketball  Is like the number one  So we're like  Oh we should  You know  We should send over  The Bulls  And see what happens  And you know 
[02:38:30]  Surprisingly  A lot of them  It was the old Bulls  You know  Like the BJ Armstrong  Jordan  The microwave  Oh no  That was the fucking Pistons  Fuck  Pippin  Pippin  There you go  And so not a lot of people  Wanted to go  Jordan said no  Jordan said  Well we reached out  To his people  And they just  Never got back to us  Okay  Yeah so then we  So then we  So then we  We put  We sent them over  And we were hoping  That we would get  Sort of unparalleled access  That we would see  Shit off the tour 
[02:39:00]  Because you know  Everyone gets the same tour  You go to the  Yeah you go to the DMZ  You go to the  House of the people  The library of the people  The thing of the people  Everything of the people  And we wanted to see  You know see if we could  If we could sort of  Game the system  To see something new  And to get something new  And get a new documentary  And it worked  Now when you  There was one  One of your career documentaries  I saw where you  You're outside that place  You just described  The museum  Yeah  And you're filming  Yeah  And they're telling you  Don't film  Yeah  And the guy catches  Either you or the camera guy  Lying about the size 
[02:39:30]  Of the memory card  Yeah  What did you  Like what was that  Like you said  Oh no it's only four gigs  Or something  Well what we did is  We weren't allowed  To shoot anything  So we were shooting  On like Sony Cyber Shots  You know like the little  Point and shoot cameras  Right right  We had like eight gig  Cards in them  So we would just go  Oh I'm gonna take a picture  Take a still pic  And meanwhile  Yeah it's video  And so  So you're not allowed  To shoot there  And they caught us shooting  And then they said  Oh how big is your memory card  And I said  I don't know  64 megs 
[02:40:00]  I don't know  And they took it out  And he said  Why would you lie to me  Oh shit  This is eight gig  And then we were like  I don't know  I just bought it at the airport  I bought it in Dubai  They gave me too big  Of a memory card  I don't know  You know  And but yeah  They kept threatening us  With crimes against the state  That can't be good  You don't want crimes  Against the state  In Korea  You're not getting off  No matter how good you were  That's a tough one  A little worse  Than a parking ticket  I would say  God damn  And then of course  The trips to Africa 
[02:40:30]  Yeah  Unbelievable  With the warlords  And what buck naked  The general butt naked  Yeah  Butt naked  Joshua  Butt naked  How do you even begin  To try to find these people  And how to get access to them  I mean it seems impossible  Well it started out  As a magazine article  Or a magazine  Vice magazine  And it was  It was a general butt naked  In the two pack army  Because they had stolen  A container ship  And in one of the containers 
[02:41:00]  Were all these two pack  Shakur t-shirts  And so they  They used it as a  As a  As a uniform  For an army  And so  So for us  So for us  That's a perfect story  Because it's culturally weird  And everything  And then we're like  Well who are they fighting again  Oh they were fighting  These dudes who fought naked  Because they thought  The bullets couldn't kill them  You know  We're like  Wait a minute  What did they fucking  Fought naked  And so  Yeah they were  They had this  General  General butt naked  And we were like  Oh well we  You know  We liked him  Actually we met 
[02:41:30]  A bunch of generals  And they all have  These crazy names  Like there's  General Mosquito  And they're all afraid of him  Because mosquitoes bring malaria  Right  So there's General Mosquito  And then the general  Who fought him  Was General Mosquito Spray  Are you shitting me  They really had a  General Mosquito Spray  And there was General Rambo  Who we met  He was awesome  And then there was  I remember that  General Bin Laden  And there was two actual  General Bin Ladens  But they take on these names  And General Butt Naked's thing  And when you first meet him  You're kind of like  You know 
[02:42:00]  You're sort of like  Oh this guy  Did like the worst things  Oh horrid atrocities  And he'll tell you about them  He's like  Yeah  Before we would fight  We would get an innocent child  Open up the kid's back  With a machete  Take out the heart  And while the heart's still  Sort of thumping  We'd eat it  And then we'd take off our clothes  And go into battle  And we couldn't be killed  And you're like  What happens when the first guy  Gets shot  Yeah  Yeah  You know  And they're like  Well because it was  It was part of  He's from the Crown tribe 
[02:42:30]  And he was like  Brought up as a  As a  I don't know  A medicine man  Or a shaman  Or whatever  So that's what  They were doing  He was sort of  Bringing it forward  From that  But they did some  Crazy  Crazy  But the other thing  That I got a lot of shit for  When the UN got mad at me  Everyone got mad at me  Is  Everyone was talking about  Cannibalism  Like everyone  Everybody I talked to  Everybody was like  Yeah you know  It was either ritual cannibalism  Or we were starving  So we were eating  You know  We were people  You know  We'd cut up people  And we'd eat them  And you know  But Naked tells a story 
[02:43:00]  About like  He's on the bus  And like they went to get  A stick of meat  And oh  He ate it  And he goes  Oh that's human  You know  He knew  And by the way  He knew it was human  Because it's got a  You know  He ate a lot of it  And so I'm like  Okay  So I put it in my piece  Like well you shouldn't  Be talking about cannibalism  You're like  They're eating the fuck  Out of people  Why wouldn't you  Why the fuck  Wouldn't I fucking  Talk about cannibalism  Why was  What was the problem  With you talking about it  They just want to  Cover up shit like that  Yeah  People don't  People like  They're like 
[02:43:30]  Oh we're trying to  You know  You know  We're trying to  Get a tourism train  Or whatever  Boost tourism  Yeah  Right  And you're like  Well you know  Rampant cannibalism  There was some stat  Where it was like  60% of the population  Or something  Wow  It's not  It's not an isolated case  What do you think  Is the biggest problem there  Why it's so ravaged  With poverty  Disease  Warlords  You know  That's the interesting  Really interesting thing  About it is 
[02:44:00]  You know  We went there  Because of this  Tupac  And Buttnake  And all the different  Warlords  And then  We find out  Oh  You know  It was founded  By America  It was bought  By America  Liberia  Freed slaves  And  Monrovia  Is named after  President Monroe  And the constitution  Was written here  And what's interesting  Is the freed slaves  Went back to  Africa  And then promptly  Enslaved the locals  Based on the  System they had learned  Here in America 
[02:44:30]  That's a great idea  And so all the rulers  Have names like  Charles Taylor  Or you know  John Hopkins  Or whatever it is  Until Samuel K. Doe  Came to power  Who was the first  Native Liberian  And then that started  The civil war  The first of three  That just killed  Like the country  But you know  It's completely  It's completely corrupt  America was funding  One or other of the sides  It was a civil war  For like 20 years  And in a civil war  Like everyone's just  You know  You killed my dad  I'm going to kill your brother  And everybody's killing everybody  It didn't work out well 
[02:45:00]  For President Doe  Did it  No it didn't  Oh wow  He got eaten  In the president  He got eaten  I saw the video  Where they cut his ear off  Yeah they eat him  Yeah  And actually the guy  Who cuts his ear off  In that video  Prince Johnson  Is a senator right now  Oh really  This is the president  Of the country  He's crying  He's like  Okay Prince  I'll talk  I'll talk  He was ready to talk  What do you mean  You're going to talk  They don't care  Yeah yeah  I don't care what you say  Prince is drinking the bud  In an army outfit 
[02:45:30]  It just looked like  Wow this is not a guy  Up for a negotiation  It's horrifying  It's one of those  Fucking reservoir dog scenes  I don't care what you know  Or don't know  I'm going to torture you  Yeah  Anyway  That doesn't matter  Yeah  What kind of vibe  Did as a person  Like you pick up  People's energy  Did butt naked have  Because you said  Something very interesting  Towards the end of the piece  About how you were feeling  About him  Yeah I mean  So Liberia's  You know  Where we were going  In Liberia's  Sort of very dangerous places  And I think you see it  In some of the places  Like we would 
[02:46:00]  It's very poor  Like it's incredibly poor  And you know  I have a soft spot for kids  So like kids come up  And you're like  You know  If you change like 10 bucks  They give you like  A suitcase full of money  So you know  You're giving them  You're giving them like  You know  Five cent notes and stuff  And then  The sad thing happens  Is like  The bigger kids come  And take the money  From the little kids  And then the  Like the teenagers come  And take  And then the guys  With the guns show up  And you're like  Oh fuck  You know  I just wanted to  Give the kids money  Or anything  Like I bought them  Cokes one day 
[02:46:30]  Oh not Cokes  Whatever  Some sort of soda  In a pasta bag  And then the  Same thing happened  Like the bigger fish  It's a little microcosm  Of the whole country  Everywhere you go  You're just immediately  Surrounded  And people are like  Yelling at you  And wow money  Does it feel menacing  Totally menacing  Yeah  Fuck  You're a dumb question  Wasn't it  Yeah totally  Totally  Totally menacing  And we've been  In West Point  And we  You know  It's one of the worst slums  In West Africa  And they're just like  You know  What the fuck  Are you doing here  We don't want you  You fucking asshole  And  What prevents them 
[02:47:00]  From just ripping  Your head off  And taking  Nothing  And that's  That's  That's  That's what we  Finally realized  So I gotta say  Oh shit  But when we were  With Butt Naked  People knew who he was  They know he's still  Got his guys  Like I'll get back  To that later  But anyway  You know  All of a sudden  We were shit scared  All the time  And then you're with him  You're like  I'm not so fucking scared  And he's like  Hey we'll dress up for church  You dress up in the white suit  And everybody's like  Hugging you  And all of a sudden  It's like  You went from being  Shit scared all the time  To feeling like  Oh  And he's preaching  And he's a great preacher  And you know 
[02:47:30]  And all of a sudden  You're going  This guy  You know  He's not so bad  He's not so bad  And then as he was  Preaching one day  And I was like  Getting into it  And people were singing  And I'm having a good time  I'm like  This guy used to kill  And eat people  This guy  Like  He used to kill  And he had made  Like you know  20,000 people  It's not like  Four people  Right  And you're like  Holy fuck  I have Stockholm syndrome  Like I'm a fucking  This is weird  Because he's a charming guy  He's the leader of men  So he's obviously  He can speak well  He's a charming guy  Now he's an evangelist preacher 
[02:48:00]  And the big question is  Is he doing that  To get out of war crimes  Or is he doing that  Because he believes in it  I don't know  I don't know the answer  But I find it weird anyway  Like oh fuck  I killed an 820,000 people  I'm Ted Bundy  Yeah but you know  Now I'm fucking  You know  A bishop  You know  Because in the  Born again church  And then oh  It's fine  You don't have to go  How did you sleep  Just the basic shit 
[02:48:30]  That you got to do  As a human being  You're in this crazy place  And you got to like  Close your eyes eventually  It's a funny thing  Because there's no grid  There's no power grid  In Monrovia  So it's like  There's no electricity  And there's no real nice  But the only place  The Lebanese  Sort of run the town  The Lebanese mafia  Right  It's like  And so there's this  One Lebanese hotel  That you can sort of  Stay at  So you felt like  You were safe for the night  Well they're  They're armed as shit  Right  Yeah yeah yeah  And but there was  A funny thing 
[02:49:00]  Like you know  When we left West Point  That night  We're in the car  We shot it  Is that the brothel  Or no  Yeah we're in the brothel  And they all wanted hair  And we're like  No no no  You know  We just want to  You talking about  West Point  And then they're like  We want money  And then all of a sudden  When they started  Screaming money  Like this  The whole brothel  Just like came in  And we're like  Okay run  That was the stupidest  Thing in the world  Because like where  Because there's no road  It's just  Where  It's like a rabbit warren  Of like corrugated iron  In the dark  In the dark  And so you're like  Running into  This is me doing pantomime 
[02:49:30]  You're like running  Into walls  And you're just  And by the way  You know like  We're the only white people  That we're  You know  We have cameras  You're glowing  Exactly  It's like five light bulbs  Running through the fucking dark  And like  Everyone's tripping  And running  And so finally  We get in the car  And the car is surrounded  And our  Our  Liberian driver  And security  Freaks out  Like he's just  Like terrified  So he just  Guns it  And he nearly  Drives all these people  And we're like  Trying to calm him down 
[02:50:00]  Because  And we say it  Like if you  Obviously  See if you hit somebody  And do that  You're surrounded by like  A thousand people  That was just gonna  You're done  So we're  It's tense  And tense  And tense  And tense  And we get out  And we're gonna go back  To this hotel  And we're like  General Butt Naked  And this posse  Are at your hotel  Waiting for you  And you're like  They've heard about you  And they want to meet you  Before you know  And you're like  Oh  I don't know  Which is worse  You know  Because from what  We've heard about this guy  And so we went to the  He made us get him 
[02:50:30]  Rooms at the hotel  It's like 15 bucks  And then  That night  When you say  How do you sleep  We went to bed  And there's like  Him and his guys  In the same hotel  And you're like  I don't know  Why they're here  I don't know  Like  I don't  You know  And by the way  People were trying to  Kill him  The whole time  We were there  Really  God you're nuts  You're nuts  So  He's still a big mark  Right  He's a big mark  Because he killed  A lot of people  Because if you kill  A lot of people  Then those relatives  Right  A lot of relatives  And this is what 
[02:51:00]  General Rambo says  In the documentary  He's like  Look  We're people of war  All we know is war  Now there's 70% unemployment  Right  So you have all these guys  Who own the only food  And power  And whatever they ever had  Was when they were at war  All they know is war  Now they have no jobs  They're starving  They all have guns  Buried in the jungle  I kept asking  Why wouldn't they fight  Why wouldn't you fight  Yeah yeah  If you're fucking starving  And you have guns  And you know how to do it  And you've been a soldier  Since you were 11  Why wouldn't you do it  And he's like  Look  We're children of war 
[02:51:30]  We are just waiting  For it to come up again  We're going to start again  What happened  Now the UN's in there  The UN's in there  Yeah  Yeah  So  But they're going to pull out  Yeah  Eventually  Yeah  And what's your prediction  Having been there  Well it all  I mean  When we were there  It's already started  They've already made incursions  Into Equatorial Guinea  Sierra Leone  All the neighboring countries  Have had lots of problems  With coups and things  And they're all Liberian  Sort of mercenaries  So it's already happening  I mean  You know  The region is sort of  Very unstable 
[02:52:00]  And because of  You know  Because of the continuing  Sort of  Are there any lights  At the end of the tunnel  For that whole area  Well the problem  With most of these countries  And the only country  More fucked up than Liberia  Is Congo  And the reason why  Is that they have  Mineral wealth  Right  And so if you  There's some stat  If you have oil  Or mineral wealth  That chances of a civil war  Are two in three  Whereas if you don't  It's one in fifty  You know  So  What's happening there  Is Congo  Which supplies 
[02:52:30]  The majority of  Coltan  Which is like  For phones  Is it metal?  Yeah it's like  A rare earth metal  We need them  So like every  Smartphone needs it  Used on circuit boards  And what not  And so this has caused  A continual civil war  I think it's actually  Now the sixth  Bloodiest war in history  But no one talks about it  Because it's all about  This coltan  It's the same thing  In Liberia  So what's happening  I mean  What has to happen  We just did a piece  On the oil in Nigeria  Holy Jesus  And the pirates 
[02:53:00]  The oil pirates  Have you seen the shit  They hack into the  The other steel barges  Or they hack into the pipeline  And then they have  These refineries  That they do  Like they look like  Moonshine stills  But they're like oil  Like five billion barrels  And they're siphoning it off  And selling it all over  West Africa  Because they turn it  Into gasoline  It's crazy  Anyway  The thing is  Unless they get a hold  On their  On their  Sort of  Natural resources  And sort of  Share the wealth  And sort of 
[02:53:30]  With the people  Because generally  Eight people  Take all the money  And then everybody  Right  Yeah  Then I don't see  That it's going to  Get any better  Because there's  The eight people  Get it  And then eight  Other guys  Say you know  What we want  Their money  And then they  Get their army  Together  Because I've heard  Plenty of stories  Of how you know  All the resources  They get raped  By the west  And everything  But I mean  There are plenty  Of places  That have resources  And have figured out  How to make it  Profitable for the country  And build a viable  Society  Africa is 
[02:54:00]  Africa  Have you heard  Of executive solutions  No  It was Margaret Thatcher's  Son  So he was  He was a guy  Who had this company  And he was  The ex prime minister  First woman prime minister  Of England  And their thing was  They would go in  With a South African mercenary  If you needed to go in  Anywhere  And you needed  Resource wealth  They would go in  Organize the coup  Put in the puppet  Wow  They got caught 
[02:54:30]  Actually in Zimbabwe  By Mungabi  Because he's like  No we're not  Going to let this  Happen anymore  I'm no fan of Mungabi  But you've got to say  Yeah  I mean  Having these dudes  Just drop in  Kill everybody  And say you know  It's like dogs of war  You know  That's what they were doing  Yeah  And  That was a great movie  Yeah  And based on  On these kinds  Of companies  Oh yeah  And so  Look Dave  There's a long  Tradition  A long history  Of sort of  Destabilizing  And then going in  And taking the stuff  I mean if you look  At Nigeria  Nigeria is 
[02:55:00]  Unbelievably wealthy  Country  I know  They keep trying  To send me  Ten million dollars  But I just got to  Send them some money  To get it  Yeah  Yeah  But I'm waiting for it  But if you look  At the oil  Like completely corrupt  Like so corrupt  Everyone's stealing it  And  Like the thing is too  But I was like  Stealing oil  Like they're stealing  Like 50 million barrels  That's great  You can't sell it  Like on the street  Yeah  Here's a barrel of oil  So they do sell some  They refine some 
[02:55:30]  And they sell it as gas  But a lot of it  They just sell back  To like Shell  And stuff  And you're like  Wow  Selling their own shit  Yeah  And so you're like  Oh you know  It's so corrupt  And when you get into it  You know this farmer  Just won this case  And we talked to him  And when you go to his  Like where they live  You know it's just  Completely covered  In oil tar  And when we went out  Into the jungles  It's just flaming  You know columns  Like you know  Hundreds of feet  Into the air  And smoke  And shit 
[02:56:00]  And it looks like  You ever see that  Popcorn  Popcorn Willis  Where the old moonshiner  And he'd make a  He could make a  Moonshine rig  Out of anything  That's what these guys  Are doing  They're literally making  Moonshine gas  A refinery  Yeah  And they'll pop  Out of light  Yeah  And they'll pop  A hole into the  Into the  Into the  Pipeline  And then they'll just  Have hoses and shit  And flames  And everything going  Out  You occasionally do  Hear of explosions  On especially  Natural gas lines  Or gasoline  Refined gasoline lines 
[02:56:30]  In some of these countries  And they try to tap  Into these things  And you hear like  Twenty people  Were just incinerated  When a pipeline  Blew up  Well they have this  Smoke that comes out  As a byproduct  It's a steam  And like at any  Given second  The whole steam  Can catch on fire  Oh shit  And you're engulfed  In the steam  So you're like  I'm going to get  The hell out of the steam  The air is on fire  Pretty much  The air is on fire  Wow  You see these places  But aren't you amazed  That people actually  Like this is their life  Day in and day out  Like you guys go  For however long you go  And see this hell 
[02:57:00]  But that's  Like that's somebody's  Fucking existence  Shit beach  Was unbelievably disgusting  And it doesn't even  Come across  Because you know  You see the shit  On the beach  But that whole  There's a whole thing  That looks like  Like a  Like a mountain of garbage  That's all shit  Oh my god  Like that's all shit  I don't know what shit beach is  Explain what you saw there  On shit beach  Lake Liberia  So yeah  In Monrovia  The toughest part of town  The worst part of town  Is called West Point 
[02:57:30]  And West Point  Actually anywhere else  Would be like Miami Beach  It's on a nice  Beautiful beach  Right  And so it's a really  Hardcore slum  And they  They don't have  Toilet facilities  So everyone just goes  And shits on the beach  So the beach is just  Like the whole beach  Is just covered in shit  Like and it's  Like it reeks  Like  Oh it's gotta be  But it's actually  It's really  Sad  Because you sort of  Walk up there  And like kids  Are just walking  Onto this big  Mountain of shit  Taking a shit 
[02:58:00]  Picking up like  Like a piece of garbage  Or something  And then just wiping  Their ass with a piece  Of garbage  And you're like  That's why  That's it  It's a tragedy  It's like that  And then you see that  And you're just like  What the fuck  I always  I always have the saying  Where are all the adults  Like what  Yeah  You know  All this aid  Going to Africa  All this stuff  You know  All these things  Where we're doing  And you're like  We have shit beach  Like it's like  That's just being  All that  I guess all that  A lot of that aid  Is just being intercepted  By warlords  And what not  Those eight people  That get all the money  Exactly 
[02:58:30]  Wow  It just doesn't seem  To be a solution  It's amazing  Yeah  Yeah  It definitely  You come back  And to answer your question  You know  A  I've had a lot of kicks  At the can in life  I've had a lot of  Second chances  Thank you  And you go  To  You know  You go to somewhere  Like Liberia  And you realize  Oh they don't get  A kick at the can  There is no kick  At the can  Like you know  Oh maybe  I'm going to do  A TV show  Like  You know  No that's not  Part of the option  You know  And when you go  To Afghanistan  Or you know 
[02:59:00]  A lot of these countries  There's no kick at the can  And then you realize  Wow  You know  I was saying this  The other day  I was saying like  You know  America is problematic  But still you can come here  And make your own shit happen  You can do your own shit  You can make something  You can you know  Work hard  And get ahead in life  And all that stuff  And in a lot of these countries  It's like  You don't get a kick at the can  So you said it earlier  About the kids  That would drive me nuts  Seeing kids  That have  That's my particular  There's no fucking hope  Whatsoever  So what's the best  These kids could hope for  In their lives  That's it right 
[02:59:30]  Just to live  Just to get to  Survival  Yeah  And that's  That's the heartbreaker  That's my Achilles  Heel  Is kids  Because you see the kids  And you're just like  Fuck  With no hope whatsoever  For anything  Just survival  Of substance  And that's when you start  You know  With money  Like you know  Five bucks is a  Is a five kilo bag of rice  And so instead of  Giving cokes and shit away  I was trying to buy rice  And you know  Give rice to the kids  And give rice to them  But then  It's just the big  Eat fish  Eat the little fish  And stuff 
[03:00:00]  And you're just like  Every time you go  To these places  And it's just tiny  Little amounts of money  And the kids are so  Like the funny thing  About it too  Is I  You know  I have  I have two rules  One is  The more you need a toilet  Then the worse the toilet  Will be in direct proportion  So if you're  For example  If you really have to shit  In Liberia  Which you do  Because  You have parasites  Oh  You have to go to shit beach  Because there are no toilets  So did you shit on shit beach?  No  I couldn't bring myself  I can't describe to you 
[03:00:30]  What shit beach is  It's literally a mountain  Of shit that's rotting  In the sun  So it's worse  And by the way  You're terrified of malaria  And everything  Yeah  And by the way  You're terrified of other things  Which it turns out  Not to be paranoia  Because I came back from there  With like helmet headed parasites  Living in my bowels  And all kinds of things  That's what I was going to  Ask you about next  Like  At one point  When you're walking through  That swampy  Yeah  With no shoes on  Barefoot  Well that's the thing 
[03:01:00]  You go over there  And they're like  Don't do this  Don't go into any  Still water areas  Don't do this  Don't go anywhere  And there's like  These worms that can go in  And there's things  That can do  And there's obviously malaria  Which is really bad  And there's this  And there's that  And then butt naked goes  You know we meet him  And he's like  Oh I'm going to take you out  I'll show you  And he literally takes us  To a swamp  With like  You know  Like swamp  Like  Yeah  Just African jungle swamp  With like tepid fetid  Stinking rotten water  And he's like  Take off your shoes and socks  And get in  No 
[03:01:30]  I know  Yeah  And that's when I say  As I'm walking  I'm like  This is where all fear  Stems from  Because  You've just heard  Every warning  In the book  And you're literally  Going to the place  Where it all comes from  Why barefoot though  Why didn't you  Just keep the shoes on  Because he  Like  And he said  He said  Take your shoes off  And then afterwards  He's like  You know what  You're the only person  I brought here  Who got in the water  And I didn't have to carry  So now you're my boy  And blah blah blah  It's like some sort of  Rite of passage  But you're like  As you're doing it  You're like  What the fuck's in the water 
[03:02:00]  There's a worm  Going up my ass  I've seen those  Like the monsters  Inside you  Oh yeah  And it's like  You came back  From a trip  And  There's literally  A monster living here  Do you have parasites  Yeah  So I  I had this hernia  And I had to get  An operation  And then  When I came back  I went to a tropical  Disease doctor  And he was like  Oh you're not  Getting an operation  You've got  Helmet headed  Fleshing parasites  Living in your bowels  Holy shit  That will perforate  Your bowels  If you  If you move  The hernia onto  So they were  Big fuckers 
[03:02:30]  They were like  They were  And stuck in there  How big  Well they were like  You know  Big  Is that like  Four inches  Yeah yeah  I keep doing  Pantomime  And they hooked  Wait you have  Four inch things  Yeah  With like  You know  Like kind of  Holy fuck  Fangy fangy  Fangy fangy  I thought it was  Microscopic shit  No  I'm sorry  To take these  Serious  Like drugs  To get rid of them  They came in  One bottle  And there was  Two of them  In one bottle  And they're like  Don't exceed  That dosage 
[03:03:00]  Like that's one  Full dose  And they gave me  Five bottles  I'm like  This isn't  Whoa  This isn't good  Wait you had to  Drink this  Whatever  No so it's like  It's like a  It's a prescription bottle  Right  But only two  But there's only  Two pills in it  And that's all  You're allowed to take  Like that's it  And they gave me  Five bottles  Five bottles  Of two pills  Yeah  Of two pills  And you're like  Shit dude  So you couldn't  Have your hernia  Operation  Because you had  This fucking  Clawheaded monster  Dug into your bowels  Yeah  So what happened  When you move  The hernia  Well they were saying  Like when you move 
[03:03:30]  The hernia  To like fix it  When you shove it  Back in  If it pushes  On the bowels  The flesh eater  Could perforate  The bowel  Oh  How many did you  Have in you  I had two  Big ones  And then I had  Another  How the fuck  Do they get in there  Well that's what  I don't know  I think it's  Afghanistan  I think it's  Afghanistan  But do they start  A lot smaller  And they were  Growing in there  Yeah  It's gotta be  And they just  Continue to grow  Holy fuck  And did you  Did you know  They were in there  No no  No clue right  No the guy said  You know  They're parasites  No pains  Or anything like that 
[03:04:00]  Well you have  Lots of weird shit  But I'm used to it  But they  They say like  They're  They  They want to host  You know  They want to live  So they don't want  You to know  That they're in there  So the symptoms  Are very sort of  So they try not  To make a big  Fucking to do out of it  Yeah exactly  Quiet  No parties  Just eating  Like we're used to  Eating here  And you assume  Everything's kind of  Inspected  And you know  They recall  E. coli food  And stuff  Try to do that  But I would assume  Everything over there  Is like out of 
[03:04:30]  Indiana Jones  Where it's just  A fucking beetle guts  On a leaf  It's a problem  Eating is a problem  Drinking is a real problem  Yeah  Drinking is a real problem  And especially  Tell me about it  In the Muslim world  Because a lot  It's like a thing  You know  You have to  You know  Here's  For example  In Afghanistan  They say  You know  Whatever you do  Don't drink the green tea  Whatever you do  Do not drink the green tea  And then you go  And like  We were interviewing  The Taliban and shit  And they're like  Here's the green tea  Oh man  If you say  No thank you  I don't want that 
[03:05:00]  You're fucked  It's an insult  And fuck you  And all this thing  There you are  In front of that flag  So you're sitting there  With your  Yeah exactly  And you're like  Oh I gotta drink the green  Goddamn tea  And there's a lot of places  Like that when we were  Shooting in  How bad was it  Was it as bad as they said  Well I don't know  That's what I think  Maybe the shit  Comes from there  Like who knows  Where it comes from  But no the green tea  Doesn't taste bad  No what do you mean  Nothing happened to you  Like explosive diarrhea  Or anything  Oh yeah  I think that's where  He's getting out  Yeah  Where's your passport from  Canada 
[03:05:30]  Your Canadian passport  Yeah  Okay  Is that easier than  An American passport  Would be  Or  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Somehow Canadians  It's like  Yeah come on  You're alright  You're Canadian  We're like Americans  Kid brothers  Right right  Yeah he's  His older brother's a dick  But he's an alright  He's cool though  Yeah yeah  What was the worst thing  You ate  Because you were hungry  And you just knew  You couldn't hold out anymore  I mean street meat  We've heard about street meat  Over the years 
[03:06:00]  Street meat  Street meat's always stupid  That could be anything  I mean generally  You try to stick to  Like cereal bars  There was one time  We were in  In southern Sudan  And there was  There was like a camp  A UN camp actually  We went to this UN camp  And we hadn't been eating  And we were really hungry  So we were like  Oh we're going to eat at the UN  It was like MASH 4077  And so we went in  And we  I got like  Cereal  And I put milk  On the cereal  And I was like  Oh yeah 
[03:06:30]  I'm going to have  Real cereal milk  And I took one bite  And the  The milk was like  You know when  Like a chicken goes bad  And there's that liquid  Like blood  And chicken juice  At the bottom  Of the sort of  Package  That's what  I'm about to barf  Just thinking about  But that's what  The milk tastes like  I don't know what  Had happened  But it was like  Chicken  Chicken  Rotten chicken  Juice  And I was just  Barfing  And like  Get it out of me  Like no  And you're like  You know 
[03:07:00]  That was pretty bad  That's disgusting  And you said  Interestingly enough  The worst place  You were dating  To me  The craziest thing  You did  Aside from like  Was fucking  Juarez Mexico  Like there's no  Where I would be  More afraid of  Than Juarez Mexico  Yeah  Well because in  Most places  Like in North Korea  They'll get you  And there'll be  Some sort of trial  And there'll be  Lots of yelling  And lawyers  And things  And you know  Bill Clinton  No don't kill  My baby  And you know  In Iran  Same kind of thing  In Afghanistan  In reality 
[03:07:30]  They're going to  Trade you  For somebody  Like you know  There's always  A thing  In Mexico  They all make  Their money  By smuggling  Drugs  They're all  Smugglers  Right  So any camera  Is bad camera  So they're just  They don't ask  They don't say  Hey let's negotiate  They don't give you  A piece of paper  They don't say  Let's yell at each other  For a while  They just shoot you  And you know  A button man  I believe they're  Called Centenario  Or yeah  Centenario  They're 200 bucks  A week  So you can just  Get like  I don't know  200 of them 
[03:08:00]  And just say  I have 200 assassins  Now working for me  And so  The murder rate  In Juarez  So it's not only  It was the most  Dangerous city  In the world  For a journalist  Now it's the most  Dangerous city  In the world  It's way more  Dangerous than  Afghanistan  Way more dangerous  Than Iraq  During the wars  During the wars  Holy shit  There's been more  People killed  In the drug wars  Than in Iraq  And Afghanistan  Combined  On the American side  And so  When you go there  It's completely run  By the drug lords  And when you drive 
[03:08:30]  To where we were  In the areas  That we were  There are sort of  Murder highways  You know  And if they see  Any camera  Or anybody  And everyone's  Kind of an informant  So everyone knows  Where you are  At all times  And by the way  It cost me  You know  75 cents  A bullet  To get you  And so people  Are always like  Oh where's the scariest  Place  And you're like  Mexico  I've been to  Fucking Cancun  I went to Joe's  Tuna barge  And boom boom room  Like  Joe's tequila barge 
[03:09:00]  Probably not a tuna barge  No  But  And then  But if you go to Juarez  And they're fighting it out  And the Zetas  Are like  Killing everybody  Weren't they  They're big  Weren't they  Mostly ex-cops  And fucking military  So they were trained  They were trained  By the DEA  They were trained  The Zetas  Initially were trained  By the DEA  To be anti-narco dudes  And then  They hired themselves  Out to be bodyguards  To the Gulf Cartel  And then they said 
[03:09:30]  Why are we being bodyguards  We can just be  The Gulf Cartel  Let's do it ourselves  And so they  Then they started  Killing everybody  And because they were  Sort of better killers  Than everybody  They became the sort  Of predominant cartel  So they're trying to  Move in  To Juarez  And they're having  This big war  Who runs Juarez now  It's the  What's his name  Master Blaster  There's El Chapo  Actually if you come  If you leave Juarez  And go south  There's a huge mountain  With a big like  50 story horse 
[03:10:00]  On the mountain  Like in white  Rocks  They put on  And that's  That's the  That's the symbol  Of the cartel  Right there  Like 50 stories high  So there's Chapo  There's  There's the Zetas  There's the Juarez  Cartel  There's  There's three  Three main groups  And you know  They're all fighting  I believe  There's another cartel  Coming out of Chihuahua  Now  Chihuahua  Is another  Very dangerous city  In Sinaloa  So it's 
[03:10:30]  It's  Isn't there enough  For everybody  Yeah  Well they all  The irony is  They all live in El Paso  Because El Paso  Is the safest  City in America  So all the heads  Of the cartels  Live in El Paso  Wow  And then in Juarez  It's just a fucking  Oh so there's cartel heads  Living in the states  El Paso  Except for the guy  Who's in the  El Chapo  Is in the mountains  Right  They don't know where he is  El Chapo  They don't know where he is  The guys that we  The guys that we were  Sort of  I guess close to 
[03:11:00]  Or worried about  Was El Requin  And he was this guy  Who  We went down there  Because we heard this story  About the Mormons  Were fighting  The cartels  Right  And  Which they are  And  You know  There's the  LeBaron clan  And they live in  Colonial LeBaron  And this guy  El Requin  Lived literally  Seven miles down the road  And had one of the  Hardest cartels  He's actually  Famous because  He went into  A drug rehab center  And massacred 
[03:11:30]  Everyone in the  Rehab center  He killed 18 people  Rehab centers  They take away  From business  Exactly  You don't want  To rehab  Yeah  So he killed  Everyone in the  Rehab  This guy  El Requin  Really bad dude  Oh yeah  And he kidnapped  One of the  LeBaron kids  And then  The LeBaron's  Went to war  And they armed  Themselves  And you know  Fucking  You know  Got him back  Which is very rare  Wow I bet  Who knew there was  A Mormon  Mexican drug cartel  War going on  Well actually  They  The LeBaron's  Live in  Colonial LeBaron 
[03:12:00]  And right across  From that  Is where  The Romney's  Live  And  Mitt Romney's  Dad was born  In Colonial  Dublin  Which is a big  At the time  A big polygamist  Community  Yeah  A Mormon community  And so they're  Sort of tied together  I guess they were  They've been missionaries  For years  They would just go down there  And spread the word  Or how did they end up  The reason why they went  Down there  Initially was  When  The Mormons  Lost their war  With America  They had to  Outlaw  Polygamy 
[03:12:30]  And so  A bunch of  Mormons  Went down to Mexico  And said  No we're going to  Keep doing it  Because that's  The way you  Boy that's really  Dedication to  Fucking a lot of women  So they went down  So they went to Mexico  Because the  Fundamentalist Mormons  Believe that's the way  To get to heaven  Is the more wise you have  I'm starting to realize  I was so lucky  To be born on Long Island  Oh thank you  I love my mom  Yeah  And my dad  That's great  It's fucked up  Yeah  It's a lottery  Yeah  Yeah it really is 
[03:13:00]  You know  We're so fucking lucky  Very lucky  Where are you going to end up  What do you got planned  Future one  Well so we have  A lot of stuff coming up  It's actually  Usually on Vice  You know we  We put it up right away  We shoot it  We cut it up  So we get  Sort of immediate  Sort of glorification  Yeah  To our megalomania  But we've been actually  Sitting on  On all the best stuff  We've ever done  For this HBO show  Which premieres on  The 5th of April  Friday night  At 11 o'clock  At 11 o'clock  Week from Friday  Yeah  And so all of the best stuff 
[03:13:30]  I believe we've ever done  We've been sort of  Holding on to  For the past year  Is about to  Is about to launch  And the North Korea stuff  Is just a small part of that  We have some crazy shit  And you know  We hope people  I've seen some of it  In the  I went to the offices  And I don't know  If you're saying  What the topics  Of the story  You're covering  A lot  But there was  A couple of  Really good ones  I only saw  Two or three  Of the stories  It was fucking amazing  Yeah  So we  The child suicide bombers  Of the Taliban 
[03:14:00]  Is like  We have  The only footage  I know of  In the world  Of these kids  Who were  Caught  Some as young as six  Who were caught  Trying to be suicide bombers  And we have  You know  We talk to the Taliban  About why they're using  The children  And then we  We have  You know  Footage of  Actual suicide bombings  And so  It's heavy  Heavy  Heavy business  We also have  In the Philippines  To speak of  Another sort of  American influenced  Weirdness  You know  We sort of set up 
[03:14:30]  The constitution  And the government  System  In the Philippines  And also  Their right to bear arms  And it's  It's kind of like  America on steroids  Right  And they have  This thing there now  This problem  Where everybody  Has guns  And the politicians  Are sort of like  Really contentious  Like the political party  So they have  These assassins  You know  They  Who assassinate  You know  The other politicians  So they don't have  An incumbent  So they can run  Against them  And so we follow  These political things  But what happens now 
[03:15:00]  Is  They have these  Because there's so many  Assassinations  They have young kids  Because they're young  They assassinate  They  They don't get  Tried as adults  A  And B  They make their own guns  They have these  Backyard  Gunsmithing places  Where they make them  From like scrap metal  And stuff  So they're untraceable  And everything  And then they go out  And then they go  On these assassination  Wow man  So you know  Anyways  We have so many  We have actually  Speaking of North Korea  We follow defectors  From North Korea  All the way  Like how they have to 
[03:15:30]  Get out  Go all the way  Through China  And down into Laos  And then into  Thailand  What else we got  We have North Korea  Proper  We have  The world's most  Dangerous border  Kashmir  Where we  I believe again  Have some of the only  Footage in the world  Of the zero line  Which is now  India and Pakistan  Are  You know  Situations are  Oh yeah  Are heating up  None too friendly  Exactly  So we have some  Crazy crazy footage  From the Taliban  There actually  We meet the father  Of the Taliban  Hamid Ghul 
[03:16:00]  Who has some  Pretty insane things  How the fuck  Did you get  Access to him  Well you have to  Go there  I mean that's  The thing  That's usually  The big  First you gotta  Get over there  That's the important  Part  And actually  While we were there  It was  The whole thing  In Pakistan  That happened  With Malala  The young girl  Who was shot  In the Taliban  And so they got  So much bad press  That generally  The Taliban  They say  Anyone who's  Police or military  Will kill  And then  But they said  Now journalists  Especially western 
[03:16:30]  Journalists  We're gonna have  As targets  So when we were there  We're like  Oh shit  That's not good  And then  And then  They said  The state department  Said go to the  Serena hotel  Go to the Serena hotel  All the journalists  From the Serena hotel  And they're like  No no  Get out of the Serena hotel  Because then they had  Chatter  That there was a target  So we actually  Just dressed  In local gear  Went way up  Into northwest frontier  Province  Into the Taliban  Controlled areas  And just sort of  Hung out  And started shooting  And met a bunch  Of people there  And then  One of the guys  Was Hamid Ghul 
[03:17:00]  Who set up  The Taliban  And now is advocating  To nuke  India  And  How did you get him  To agree to talk to you  Like  Oh but he  He wants to talk  They want to talk  They want  They believe  That they believe  That they  You know  They're  You know  He's a politician  That really is  An odd thing  About pretty much  Every documentary  I've watched  Of yours  The people want  To talk  It's like  They want to tell  Their stories  You don't have  To pull teeth  With these  They love  Telling their stories  Yeah yeah  Well and that's  The thing 
[03:17:30]  The thing is  He's going on  I said  So you're the father  Of the Taliban  And you supported  The jihadists  And everything  He's like  You know  I won't do his accent  But he's like  But of course  I loved Osama bin Laden  He was a very  Intelligent man  He was the darling  Of the CIA  Intelligence  Just oozed out of his eyes  Just oozed out of his eyes  He's doing this sort of oozing  And like  Just he's gushing  Over and stuff  And you realize  Oh there's a lot of people  Out there  That think  He's a great guy  And really  When you're doing  The interview  You're like  Oh yeah 
[03:18:00]  Like just because  It's ingrained  In your brain  Right  Right  This is like  A bad dude  Who the world's  Most wanted man  For the longest time  This guy's talking  About him like  Yeah he's like  Superman  Fantastic  Do you ever  Like not vehemently  Or violently disagree  With these guys  But when you're talking  To these guys  They say something  So outrageous like that  Do you give your point  Or do you kind of  Just say  It's safer to agree with them  Or do they like  To have a spirited talk  I get in shit  For giving my point  Too often  Because  I don't believe 
[03:18:30]  You can be a  An objective journalist  I don't think  Like you were saying  I don't think  You can come from  Long Island  And say I got  A nice mom  And all this stuff  And then go to Africa  And be like  Oh I'm just going to  Be completely objective  About this now  About shit beach  I just  You know  There is shit  On the beach  And I'm not going to  Say if that's good or bad  You know  I just don't believe  You can do that  As a human being  So I am subjective  We call it immersionism  Where we immerse ourselves  In the story  We just press record  And let the story tell  It's in  And so yes  I am  I am a little bit 
[03:19:00]  Too vocal  And sometimes  It's not good  I do get into it  I got into it  A little bit  With the Taliban  And that's not smart  But you know  Not even through email  Is that smart  But sometimes  Obviously you do have to  You know  Curtail  You can't say  In North Korea  Hey you guys are  Bullgoose loony  You're fucking  Yeah  Because otherwise  You know  It's  Yeah  Talk about their leader  Yeah  Well it's a fascinating 
[03:19:30]  Site man  And I really  Love it  Vice's documentaries  Were amazing  And the HBO footage  I saw  Was tremendous  Child suicide bombers  Was fucking chilling  When they go  They go through  A lot of the  Explanations of how  They get them to do it  And what they tell them  And it was really  Really upsetting  Fascinating stuff  And it's done in a way  That isn't  It isn't this polished  Kind of  Let's kind of  Script something  Look at these places  And what's going on

[03:22:00]  With his shoes off  It grew in his nuts  I don't know if it grew  Inside of his nuts  It was in his bowels  I said  Oh  In his  Where the shit come out  That's exactly it  I don't know what  You know  The terminology  But they do have  Parasites  They grow  Like if you  If you go to these  Countries and you drink  The dirty water  Right  Or you jump in a  Fucking lake  Like the white people do  Yeah  That shit go on your ass  Well that's what he's saying  Like he thinks that  At some point  Whether it was in  Africa or Afghanistan  He doesn't know  Because  At some point  This tiny little thing  Probably crawled in him 
[03:22:30]  Without him knowing  And now he's had  Literally four inches  Big  Clamped in  He had three of them  Inside of him  Get out of here  And he had a hernia  That he had to  Get removed  So he had to  Operate it on  They said they couldn't  Operate on him  So it's still inside him  Well no  They couldn't operate on him  Because if they had  Moved the hernia  Then the parasites  With their claws in  Would have torn his bowels  So they had to  Give him drugs  Like these ridiculous drugs  To get all the parasites 
[03:23:00]  Out of him  Before they could  Remove the hernia  I mean  It was insane dude  That's crazy man  They do have the  Gay parasites in Thailand  Like if you go  Jump in the lake  Gay parasites  Because parasites  They have like  That gay DNA  Hormonal  I don't know  Parasites have  A specific sexuality  With herbivores  Is that what it is  I don't know  I skipped a lot  Of biology class  You may know more  Than me  Parasites are  Like naturally gay  Because they always  Go in the ass  And they grow in the ass  I don't think  You think I'm making this up  Yeah of course you are 
[03:23:30]  You make everything up  My size teacher  Told me that  When he was touching me  When he was touching you  No don't worry  This is just like  This is nature  Parasites are gay too  You know  You shh  You're like  What  I'll give you an A  Yeah  Faggot  Scary  Larry in Indiana  Sammy Sweetheart Roberts  What's up buddy  That's gay too  You think so  Slabbo  That's hot  That's it  I think that's it  That's it  People just want to  Call up and say 
[03:24:00]  Slabbo  You think there's  A lot of people  Out there with  Parasites in their ass  I hope not  He said he didn't  Know though  Yeah you never know  Until you get sick  And you go to the doctor  And it made me think  Like just listening to him  Tell the story  I don't do anything adventurous  What  I don't even eat  Like I don't go to  I don't eat Korean food  I don't do anything  What does that have to do  With anything  I'm saying  I don't do anything exotic  And just hearing him  Tell the story  Made me think  That I have parasites  There's worms  There's parasites  The tapeworm  Are the worst  Because they grow 
[03:24:30]  Throughout the whole  Like  What you call it  The small intestine  Or the big  I don't know  It grows like  Through your intestines  My boy said  He was in the army  And he pulled it out  His ass  Like it was like  How long was it  It was like  I don't know  Like six feet  Oh my  Because the intestine  It's all folded up  And everything  So it's super long  They pull it  And they had to  Pull it out slow  So the worm don't rip  So imagine  Oh because  If it rips  Now it's stuck  All up at the top  Exactly  So it's like  They had to do it  Really slow  Oh my gosh  He was like  Ooh  Ah 
[03:25:00]  He liked it  Ooh  Ah  And they put a lot  Of Vaseline in it  It was a tapeworm  That shit was like  In his shit for like  Six months  Oh my  And just growing  Because those type of  You know  Those type of situations  You never know  Until you like  Have you ever  Because you've been  You've been to a lot  Of different countries  I would assume  There's some kind of  Parasites running around  Dubai  I don't know for sure  But you've never  Had a parasite  Or anything like that  I had these  I don't know  These little  I don't know  These little like  Beetles in my nose  They call them  Bugger beetles  Bugger beetles 
[03:25:30]  They like eating  Like the nose hairs  And stuff like that  Well I guess  That's the service  When I was eating  This Egyptian bitch  Yeah  Rachel Feinstein  Oh that's so Jewish  How are you  Good  Sit down  Join us  Of course  This is DJ Who kid  How you doing  What the hell is going on in here  I don't know  Roland just handed DJ Who  Get some lotion  I want me to whack off  Because she's here  How about the whack off  Can I have some of that  Yeah go ahead  That's the black lotion though  You can use that

[03:27:00]  And everything  Right  The guy who did that  Was in here today  Oh  And he was just talking  Like he's a real life  Like Indiana Jones adventurer  He's the truth  Yes  And I'm just some peasant  That stopped by afterwards  And accidentally talked about  Greasing bitches on air  Was I on air when I said that  Yeah you were  Okay I didn't realize that  That's okay  I didn't mean to just mount in  With that whole greasing bitches thing  I liked it  You ingratiated yourself to the audience  Right away  Because they know Roland likes  Greased up bitches  I really didn't know that I was on air  I thought it started at 10.30  No no 
[03:27:30]  It started at 10  Oh no  Now the listeners know the truth about me  But yeah yeah yeah  He was in here  And he was talking about like  You know getting  Parasites up his ass  And just the  That is a lot to live up to  Dangerous  Horrible places  And then yesterday  We had some guy in here  Who was like an urban explorer  You know urban exploring?  I don't know a lot about urban exploring  Well this is what they call it  And it's guys who like  They climb up bridges  Just because 
[03:28:00]  They're weird  Or they go underground  And try to find the mole people  And everything  It's insanity  He wants to go  White people right now  That's what he wants to say  That's white people  Did you see the documentary  Dark days who kid  There was black people  Living underground too  Are there?  Crackheads  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yeah I don't have any desire  To do things like that  To like hurl my body  Into uncomfortable situations  Yeah  Actually if you find me in the woods  Something's gone terribly awry  Right  Right  Yeah he was in here  Like my favorite  Brooklyn  My favorite place to be 
[03:28:30]  Is on top of a bridge  I was like there are very few places  I would like to be less than  On the top of a bridge  I'm just so confused  Why do white people like doing that?  I don't know  I told you he wanted to say that  He did  What was in his head?  You know niggas be in Brooklyn  And shit like that  We don't fuck with that shit  Maybe you guys know the struggle  Like white people are just sitting there  Trying to get something to  They need some kind of adversity  In their life  Everything's been handed to us  Unlike you who kid  Who's sitting there  With his free Nick swag  And a diamond watch  On his wrist  I'm telling him man 
[03:29:00]  I'm gonna fuck bitches man  Oh my goodness  I'd rather fuck bitches  Than climb a fucking bridge  That's right  He'd rather grease  And bust in bitches  Yeah  And punish them sexually  You got me hooked right now  I told him earlier  That most of these parasites  Are gay  You never had any parasites  Have you had any parasites?  That's the wrong thing to assume  You ever jump in a lake?  No  That's how I like to say it  But have you ever heard of that  Like parasite and pussy  You never heard  It's always in some guy's ass  I would assume  They go into any orifice open  Think about it  Have you ever heard 
[03:29:30]  A girl come  I got a tapeworm in my car  I have not had any  Friend or neighbor of mine  Complain  Right  They have some parasites  Up their vag  And I was hoping  That's where we would start today  If one of your girlfriends  Was like  I have a parasite  Would you assume  Vagina or ass?  They never contact me again  Even over the phone  You disgust me  I would say  Tammy  I cannot hang out with  Muscle talk  I will not continue to associate  With these godless whores 
[03:30:00]  That's what I would say  That's the truth though  You've never heard that  It's always some fucking white guy  That is one rancid skank  Yeah  And I'm not a judger  I try not to judge  But that's a rancid level  Of skank  Once you have parasites  In your vagina  I guess yeah  You question everything  I think it's fair to say  It's a wrap  Whereas  A guy getting parasites  In his ass  Was more like  Why?  I'm an explorer  I'm an adventurer  I'm intriguing  Sure  He's just a fun loving fella  Right  Some tales  Some stories  Right  I have life experience  What do you have?  No one else have parasites 
[03:30:30]  It's worse  How do you admit that?  I would keep that a secret  I would not let  Keep that  Come on  If you had parasites  You would keep it a secret?  Yeah  I wouldn't go broadcasting  If I was riddled  If I was teaming  Yeah if I was teaming  With parasites  That definitely wouldn't be  My opener  When I got on stage  I need you guys to know  Something about me  Before we start  I don't even have any jokes  About it  I just want everybody to know  I am  Hey boys  I'm crawling with parasites  But if it came with  An interesting story  If you were like  Yeah  Some African general  Told me to get into a swamp 
[03:31:00]  And so I did  But then I ended up  With parasites  You still would keep that  To yourself?  Still I think  Even with that tale  I think  Yes  Fuck  Because it's not  Yeah no  It's not good  You can't  You can't get past parasites  No  You wouldn't hook up  With a dude  If he was like  No no no  I had parasites  It was taken care of  It's not good news  What do you think  Poppy  What do you think?  I would rather tell people  I got AIDS  And they come in here  And be like  I got a parasite in my ass  AIDS is better  So I can call  Fucking magic jobs 
[03:31:30]  And get the cure  Right  True  Niggas don't get AIDS anymore  They don't?  Nah  I was watching  Pedro's season  In the real world  Sorry  I take your word for it  Because I don't know  The cure is out there  Yeah but that's for  Magic Johnson  He's rich  Nah but the baby  Remember when I told you  The baby  There's a special cream  Yeah  There's a special  Cocoa butter based cream  There it is  It's really expensive  Just massage your AIDS away  But it's only available  To the upper crust  Right  That's right 
[03:32:00]  Other than that  You live with your AIDS  You take your AIDS  Yeah  You don't get even  A dollop of that cream  Yeah I mean  Weeks ago  Sam had a  You said there was a cure  The baby didn't get AIDS  It was only in the baby's dick  I didn't tell you that  No I didn't  I don't ever remember  Telling you that  They're saying mothers  With AIDS that have babies  The baby most likely  Don't have it  Because of the placenta  The sack  I think you're just saying words  Yeah  I don't think any of the  You wanted to say placenta  That was his goal  That was his chief goal  This morning

[03:47:00]  Write that to him  Tell him I miss him  I hope he's listening  I wish  Kenny if you're listening  I miss you  And I wish you were here  Hug me  You're getting very excited  Hug me  I  Yeah I'm not trying to give Club Soda Kenny a semi or anything  But I think he's a nice guy  Oh he's there  He's there  He's there  Who could  Will you break this myth once and for all  Are you tweeting at me  I just retweeted you  Show her some of the Instagram photos  She is convinced that you're in love with your wife  And I want her to know that marriage  Just because I am in a state of marital bliss 
[03:47:30]  Does not mean it's going to be great  Because who kid is a prime example of why  You should not get married  He's treating his wife horribly  You see what I mean  I wasn't  This is Tom Hanks son  What are you doing with Tom Hanks son  He's just showing me a picture  He's hurt now  I'm already  I'm not asking you to show your celebrity photo collection  I'm showing him the lesbian kiss thing  The chicks jumping out of the cakes 
[03:48:00]  There's a lot of just your guy friends  Just being good friends to each other  Oh there's you helping the Boy Scouts  Oh that's sweet  He's volunteering  A lot of pictures of volunteer work  Eating the other bitch mouth  That old lady couldn't get across the street by herself  A couple of women queering off sure  And he's spanking them  And pouring some sort of hot substance on them  Besides that it's all volunteer  You choose not to concentrate on that  I got the naked ones up here  You have naked photos in there too 
[03:48:30]  So you just  Oh dear god  That was for St. Patrick's Day weekend  He's not a good man  You know what I mean  He's fun to hang out with  I like this one girl  She just chose one tit to show him  She's a little modest with the other one  But she's presented her left breast  You picture just the one tit  That's my favorite tit  I lick it  You do?  Okay good to know  Enough about me  Rachel did you realize what he was going to do with the tit?  I had a feeling that he might be up to that 
[03:49:00]  Right  You didn't need him to maybe make the announcement  No  But I like that she just presented one and covered the other one  She was a little bashful about her right tit  His Instagram  The last tit she gave  She put forth  Oh my god  Jesus  Well that's my radio show  Don't worry about that  What's going on there?  A girl eating pussy out  Oh Jesus Christ  Yeah that's what she's doing alright  And that was happening on your radio show?  Yeah  So don't worry about that  So  And it's up on his Instagram?  Yeah  Who is that? 
[03:49:30]  That's E-Rock  He's the fat  Is that God?  Who is that?  Yeah  That's God  He's just passing judgment on who can  What a God  That's E-Rock  Hi  And that's before  What's his name come through  Came through  The Civil Rights Doom  It's one that you make fun of all the time  What's  What's Civil Rights Doom?  Al Sharpton?  Yep  Yeah I mean you can make fun of Al Sharpton can't you?  Are you an Al Sharpton fan?  He's a funny character  He said he's ridiculous  Yeah  I mean he did the commercial about blueberry pie  I thought everybody was 
[03:50:00]  He gets his dick sucked all the time  He does?  Some bitches I know  They told you?  What's the point you're making there?  We're trying to get her Civil Rights  Connection here  Oh  I understand now  Club Soda Kenny says she's the best  See?  So there you go  You're about to ask me something  I can't  I was going to ask you about your marriage  And how you met your wife and stuff  Oh oh oh  We've known each other forever  I mean we were dating for eight years  Before we  Before we got hitched  We went to high school together  We weren't dating in high school though 
[03:50:30]  Sorry who kid?  Sorry for being a human being  With emotions  And sorry for caring about people  No I like your wife is cool  So I'm not going to diss her  Right but  The story of how we met  It's a bit of a snoozer  I thought you met her at a strip club or something  No does she look like a type of girl  I would meet at a strip club?  E-Rock has an exciting life  You know what I'm saying?  Can I see a picture of her?  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  You think E-Rock has an exciting wife?  Him and his wife  They're going crazy  You know what E-Rock's an exciting life? 
[03:51:00]  Shitting in beds and all that  Who kid?  I hate to tell you this  I hate to tell you this  But E-Rock and I had a conversation yesterday  About how his Friday night went  Right  He went  This is E-Rock in there  He went down to the basement  And made himself a roast beef sandwich  On a Friday night?  On a loaf of garlic bread  While his wife got drunk with her friends  So that's  Now is your wife  Is your wife allowed to go out with other guys too?  Or do you  No  I don't care  You don't care what she does  You don't give a shit  I hope she is 
[03:51:30]  So do you guys live together?  Yeah of course  Well yeah but you're never home  So?  So I mean technically  You live together  I got kids so I gotta be there  You know what I'm saying?  She dates other guys  You date  No she don't date anybody  You won't allow it?  No I don't care  Then why doesn't she date  Does she know you date people?  She want this dick  Does she  Is she  She doesn't  You know she doesn't  You're a  You're a 40 year old man  Who's pretending he's like a kid  She doesn't want that dick anymore  You can trick these little hussies  In the club who can  But this wife of yours 
[03:52:00]  Is not looking for that dick  You know that  This dick is moist  You know what I'm saying?  Here's a picture of her  Next to Jimmy Superfly Snuka  Let me see  I'll get it  Hey  There you go  Yeah I mean  Aw she is so cute  Yeah exactly  Yeah she's adorable  She doesn't look like the type of girl  You'd meet at a strip club  No she's absolutely  I wouldn't hit her  That's the voice  That you just heard  The big guy that just walked in  I know  She looks like she has to have  Like a white boyfriend only  Jess my wife  Yeah  Yeah she's only had a white boyfriend 
[03:52:30]  She's never had a black dude before  No  But she's very  I said that in a real strong  Stealthy tone  Absolutely not  If I came there  You know  She's not interested  Okay  No I couldn't be less interested  Oh you're playing our slumber party thing  What are you playing for?  Club Soda Kenny called  With his favorite video  And wanted me to show DJ Who Kid  It's me Amy Schumer  Marina Franklin  Hot  Oh we did a fake slumber party  Yeah  So why did she ask us  Where did she go?  Eric why would you move that monitor? 
[03:53:00]  Why don't you move the monitor?  You know what?  I didn't think about that  Yeah  There you go  She's our common sense  Nikki's talking about  How do you think she got roofied?  Who could  What are you thinking?  I love it  You do  I need to be in the middle  Like  This is not  It's not a porno  It's a comedy video I think  Is it?  Yeah yeah yeah  We thought it would be fun  I brought one for you too  It's like going on tour  We're all in  It's called slumber party  If you guys want to look for it on YouTube 
[03:53:30]  Female comic slumber party  It's like we're like sisters  Oh my god  I love it  Yeah  This is the genius  Of being a hot female comedian  The joke is I really want Marina to like me  If I try to give her a pound  And she lost right  It's exactly the same thing that happened at the special you guys did  I just want a black friend  Yeah I see they got one black person to make it equal  Oh my god  Let's try kissing each other  Oh my god  The joke is that Amy's gay  And never  Doesn't realize it 
[03:54:00]  I'm joking  Like first of all  I'm joking  You know what's great?  She just wants to queer off with all of us  Booty clap  I try to get everybody to do the booty clap  No one wants to  How about we do slumber party stuff?  Yes  Yes  What is wrong?  She was going for the kiss again  You got a fat ass  Who does?  Rachel?  That's a very nice compliment  How about we just circle you  You know what the great thing  She got a fatty  What?  About being like a hot female comic is  You could do videos like this  That are funny 
[03:54:30]  Why the black girl got to smoke the blunt?  Well that's the joke  Get Al Sharpton in here  She's using the Ouija board and it's spelling dyke  Amy  She's like D-Y-K  This thing is broken  This is broken  So  And now we're trying a swastika on Nikki's forehead  A little Hitler mustache  Guys  Who put my hand in warm water?  Ew  No one  Who?  She pissed all over herself 
[03:55:00]  No way  With our shirts off  No  Mound guzzling monster dyke  We're okay  That's funny  Yeah  Okay  One time  Yesterday  I read a man  What can people look up on YouTube  If they want to see it?  Female comic slumber party  That's the best part about this whole thing  Is that just based on the thumbnail  People will watch it  Because they see all you  In your slumber party gear  Yeah  Oh look hot  I got bodies and everything  And then it's actually funny  After that 
[03:55:30]  Oh shit  The black girl left  What were you saying before  E-Rock walked in  And distracted everybody  With all of you in 90s  I don't  I don't  I don't remember  I was scared that  God  Still got  Jumped into the  Yeah that was God  Coming in here  And putting this  Thunder party video on  Oh yeah  And then he just left  Of course he did  I like that we needed him  To do that  Like we couldn't  Figured out the mouse  For ourselves  Yeah you guys  Gotta see this  Right now  I'm not giving you an option  Brad in Mississippi  Good morning boys 
[03:56:00]  And Rachel  I got an observation Sam  Who kid said  That he had pictures  Of lesbians eating box  On his show  True  Like a month ago  Y'all were doing the gay off  What's up with that  How come y'all can't have  Hot lesbians eating box  If not the main show  Even your show  That's a really good question Sam  I don't know  I mean I don't control  I didn't control the gay off  That wasn't  I mean we just  I thought you were in it too  No I wasn't in it  I thought you brought  Your wife to that  Why would I bring 
[03:56:30]  My wife to that  Who kid  Because all the gays  All the straight  I wasn't in the gay off  I was there for it  Opie and Anthony  Did a bit where they  Had men come in  Opie told me you were in it  Well he was lying to you  And they had to  Bring their wives  And then they had to do  Very gay activities  With a male entertainer  Are you serious  Yeah one of the wives  Cried  It got really weird  Like it went way further  So he had straight guys  Come on and just be gay  Like they were kissing  The guy's dick  It got way weird  I bet they sucked  The dick too 
[03:57:00]  It got way  Like we're not allowed  To have men put their dicks  In other men's butts  Yeah  Thank god  If we were  It would have happened  It went way  Like the idea was  That people would tap out  They're like  Oh I don't want to kiss a dude  I tap out  Right  They didn't want to tap out  They just kept going  How much was it for?  Like 1500 bucks  Before tax  Ouch  Before tax  That's like 750  And the wives  Were just sitting there weeping?  Well like  One of the wives  Was like  Come on you fuckers 
[03:57:30]  You can do better than this  And like was really into it  And then  Suck that dick  The other two were quiet  And then the fourth one  Was sitting there silent  The whole time  And then as soon as  The show was over  She just burst into tears  How did they find  How did they wrangle  These people?  We just  It was random right?  No we went on the show  And said hey  You want to make 1500 bucks?  Come let some gay dude  Do gay shit to you  Do you think that these guys  Were um  Were like  Gay  To begin with  We made them  Just an excuse 
[03:58:00]  Or do you think that  They just would do anything  For money  Or what do you  What do you think?  Well we made them  Bring in marriage certificates  So they were definitely  Married for real  That's crazy  And there was nothing  That's what made it so weird  There was nothing sexual  About the whole thing  That's why  Besides them suckling  On another man's dick  But it  It was all like  Yeah it was ridiculous  It just felt like  Very volunteer rapey  Yeah  Like there was nothing  Sort of  They did all these sexual acts  With no sexual energy  Yeah I know what you're saying  And it was  The whole thing  Was uncomfortable 
[03:58:30]  And violated  Yuck yuck yuck  Like everybody  Who was in the room  When it happened  Just from watching  Like left  Did anybody  So there was no  Like they went through a war  There was no chuckles  There was no fun loving time  In there  It started with chuckles  Heavy  Yeah  And then it got really  Really just dense  Jim was happy right  Yeah Norton had a great time  I was going to say  Yeah Norton probably was  Very pleased  He was very pleased  He thought the whole thing  Went off without a hitch  But the rest of us  The rest of us  Were a little  Heard Anthony  Regurgitated his cough 
[03:59:00]  For Norton  That sounds like  An invigorating morning  Yeah he was like  Finally we're doing  Some fun stuff  Ah yeah  He probably felt alive  I remember what we were  Talking about before  You were  I was saying  My wife wasn't interested  In any black dudes  But the reason that I asked  About your mom  Being insecure  About your dad  Being attracted to black women  Was because that's  What my wife  Because I used to date  Black women  Yeah  I don't  Oh you did  And so now my wife  She doesn't like me 
[03:59:30]  Looking at black women  Wow  She'll ask me on occasion  Do you wish I was black  The question has been posed  Do you wish I was black Sam  No  They give me these fake  I was aware of  Who you were  Before we said  Yeah  Just stick them on  That's all it needs  Go buy some black pubes  Do you  Do you  Do you fantasize a lot  About black women  No I mean if I still  If I wanted to be  With a black woman  I would at least  Try to be  Right  I can't be egotistical  Not to say that I would be  Because most black women 
[04:00:00]  Would probably be like  No you wouldn't  Yeah  You just wouldn't  You'd be by yourself  Does she have an ass  Your wife  She does  Okay  She's curvy  That's important  In a white man's world  Or my world  Well she's definitely  On the low end  Of the spectrum  In your world  Okay  But in the white man's world  They're like hey  Look at that  You know  That nice ass  Yeah  Exactly  It's unacceptable  Yeah  To a black man  If you have no ass  There's a sadness to it  If they just  Sometimes they'll just  Sit around at the cellar  And get angry  About women's asses  I'm like that is  A resentful ass  That is an  Indented angry  Hostile ass 
[04:00:30]  It's not even  It's not even sympathy  It's anger  Yeah I feel like  Certain asses  Will send like a black man  Into a low grade depression  They're just like  That's not fair  That ass presents nothing  And you know what  I've noticed  Really makes them angry  Is if they wear tight jeans  And the jean  Doesn't even make any  I mean  The jeans in no way  Can either like frame  Or holster the ass  There's still no ass there  Yeah  It just goes flat  To wear tight jeans  And just to  Just sort of put forth  The axe itself  They feel like it's unfair  To just present  And frame this ass 
[04:01:00]  As if it was anything at all  It's just a resentful  Absence of an ass  Rachel got a fatty  You do have a fatty  I've been told  That I have  I suppose  Good for you  I don't think  That it would  Fulfill a lot  Of like what black men  Sometimes  Yeah like I have  A friend with an ass  That's just kind of  Like an affront  And some  And I think  A lot of men need that  They need an ass  That's just like  Preposterous  Right like  It just makes you stop  And be like  She got fatty though  She does  You keep mentioning that  Yeah yeah yeah  You wear pampers?  But  Yes I'm diapered up 
[04:01:30]  As we speak  No but like yeah  So for certain black men  Like with the  The scale of what is fat  It changes  But does Rachel get  I'm very flattered  By what Who Kid said  Right I would imagine  Coming from Who Kid  That would be quite a compliment  I think so  Mom are you listening  Are you listening  I told you  Fatty  But does a fatty  On a white girl  Does it require  A white girl  Less to have a fatty  Than a black girl?  If you're a sports star  Yeah  Like if  What?  What does  Yeah what does that mean?  I don't know what  You're even talking about  Black sports stars  Only date white women 
[04:02:00]  So it's  But like for you  If Rachel's ass  Was on a black girl  Would it still be  As much of a fatty?  Yeah it would  It would  She has a fatty  I just told you that  Well alright  Well I just wanted to make sure  She was getting her full credit  Good for you Rachel  You should get  Negro tattooed on it  Thanks guys  You should be very proud  Of yourself  And don't get  Negro tattooed on it  Wouldn't make any sense  I was gonna obey him  I was gonna get  Negro tattooed on my forehead  I know  Next stop  Negro tattoo  People do all kinds  Of crazy stuff  Like for instance  They use these razors
