<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, utilizing a chaotic format interspersed with listener calls, pre-recorded bits, and in-studio segments.  The show opened with a retrospective on memorable moments from their XM Satellite Radio tenure (2004 onward), including “best bits” compilations of show openers, listener promos, and pranks.  This segued into a discussion of Anthony’s divorce, focusing on his ex-wife’s alleged theft of $40,000 and his negative feelings about children, exemplified by a story about a child’s booger on his couch.  Anthony also recounted a frustrating experience driving his girlfriend’s car in frigid temperatures.  The hosts’ commentary throughout was heavily laced with misogynistic and homophobic slurs.

Further segments included discussions of Anthony’s frustration with his children interrupting his video games (using a racial slur), the inconvenience of guests, and a listener-submitted audio bit comedically mimicking network television censorship of their show's profane content, featuring Jim Norton’s rants. A song parody about Steve’s hybrid car, a satirical playing of a 1950s anti-pornography film, and a mocking of Regis Philbin's singing were also featured.  An eBay story about a listener selling an unwanted Christmas gift and a call from a blind listener, Krista, concluded this section.  The show's frequent use of crude humor and offensive language continued unabated.

A "Let's Make a Deal" segment featured caller Tony Rivoli and an in-studio game with "Patty," escalating to increasingly explicit acts in exchange for money, culminating in her crawling naked across the studio floor wearing a Krusty the Clown mask.  This was followed by Opie's account of a minor kitchen fire caused by a Duraflame log, resulting in a visit from firefighters (described using homophobic slurs), and his angry rant about a late milk delivery in a Duane Reade bag.  The hosts then discussed Pat O’Brien’s leaked sex tapes, playing listener-created remixes, and detailing O'Brien's alleged behavior, including racist and inappropriate comments.  The segment included a drunken, rambling on-air appearance by Frankie Blue, a program director at their former station WNEW, and a reading from the book "Rent Boys" as punishment for a staff mistake.  Listeners Yukon the trucker, Rich in Brooklyn, Scott in Tennessee, Flea Man from CringeHumor.net, Scott in Wisconsin, Mike from Jersey, Dean in the Bronx, and Kenny, along with staff members E-Rock, Danny, Nathaniel, Travis, Ricky, Steve, and intern Danny, were mentioned throughout this section.

The show continued with another segment focusing on Frankie Blue's drunken on-air appearance at WNEW, featuring him repeatedly mis-stating his station's call letters.  This was followed by Jim Norton recounting explicit details of his childhood sexual experiences, including a game called “Monster Rain," and listener-submitted rap song about it.  Bob Kelly called in to relate an embarrassing encounter with Jerry Seinfeld.

A later segment critiqued Jim Norton’s on-air behavior, including flatulence and exhibitionism, leading to suggestions for a “mule guard.”  Norton recounted exaggerated sexual stories, and the hosts discussed a poorly-received song parody of “Monster Rain.”  The broadcast then shifted to a critique of Tara Reid’s reality show, featuring audio clips and imitations of her speech, followed by a phone call from Reid herself.

Further segments included a discussion about Tara Reid, including mispronunciation anecdotes; a bizarre conversation about internal farts and bowel sounds; a phone call from Tara Reid with Ray Romano; a "Bombs and Flubs" segment replaying past broadcast failures, including a rape joke and a Y2K statutory rape joke; and an interview with John and Al, the creators of a "Silence of the Lambs" musical parody. Howie Mandel’s anecdote about a disastrous potty-training experience was also featured.

A segment centered on pornography, including childhood memories of discovering it in unexpected places and experiences at adult theaters, followed by a vulgar segment mocking a caller with a cleft palate and a heated exchange with "Dragon Wagon," a trucker complaining about the show’s content.  The hosts discussed finding pornography in unexpected locations, building forts to hide it, and experiences at adult theaters.  Norton's injury from a falling panel was also discussed.

The show featured humorous audio clips, including a reimagining of *Everybody Loves Raymond*, and a guest appearance by Bernie Getz, whose reaction to a *Weekly World News* article and Opie's accidental destruction of a CD ("Haunted Pussy") created a tense moment in the studio.  A call from Rich Voss, interspersed with phone calls from his girlfriend Bonnie, further filled this segment.  An advertisement for "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" and a discussion of a "sexual harassment" training audio clip were also included.

A segment revolved around a listener, Erica, bringing a gift of vintage poker chips and cards that Opie damaged, causing Erica to leave the studio in tears.  This was followed by Andrew's karaoke performance and a call from comedian John Valby, who arrived without his keyboard, leading to improvisational acapella songs.

The show featured a prank at Steinway & Sons, with John Valby performing vulgar songs; a subplot involving Bob Kelly and an intern searching for a vehicle; a discussion of vintage cigarette commercials' racist and sexist undertones; and the interaction with “Tippi Tom,” a seemingly homeless and intoxicated individual found sleeping outside the studio. Celine Dion's Larry King Live interview following Hurricane Katrina was heavily mocked and satirized.

A prank call segment involved Opie and Anthony's interns posing as the show's hosts, tricking a woman into believing she would meet Tony Danza backstage only to be propositioned for sexual acts.  The hosts then interviewed Bob Saget, covering his career, stand-up routines, and experiences with other celebrities; his responses often including offensive retorts to critical listeners.

Finally, a segment featured Charles Ross, a one-man Star Wars show performer, whose interview was frequently interrupted by abusive phone calls from listeners, notably "Steve in Yellowstone," causing Ross to become upset and leave the studio temporarily.  The hosts discussed Ross's illness and their own experiences with abusive callers.  Maury Povich was mentioned as a scheduled guest later in the broadcast.  The entire broadcast was filled with extensive profanity and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hit the post perfectly.  Oh, it's...  Good call by Nathaniel.  He won an AC-DC first, which made that timeout perfectly.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Opie and Anthony's best fit.  My mule looks fantastic.  Anyone around here ever smell my ass?  Yeah, look at my cock.  Take that cock out and show it to Hawks. 
[00:00:30]  Not those bits, you silly goosin'.  Opie and Anthony's best bits.  Memorable moments from the Opie and Anthony Show since arriving at XF Satellite Radio in 2004.  Laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.  This what's in my pants.  Jim hates everyone.  Listener promos.  Sexiest state.  Making fun of E-Rock.  Drew Boogie remixes.  Making fun of E-Rock.  Herky-Jerky Ben impressions.  Biggest bombs.  Ramone.  Making fun of E-Rock.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Making fun of E-Rock.  Opie's delicious abs.  Travis, you're gay. 
[00:01:00]  So sit back.  Relax.  Grab a box of wine.  Throw another Java log on the fire.  And dial up a tranny.  What?  It's O&A's best bits.  Yes, it is.  This is E-Rock along with Danny, Nathaniel, and Travis.  And we'll be taking you through 12 hours of the best bits since Opie and Anthony came to XM Satellite Radio.  Let's start things off with a selection from our first category, best show opener.  It's O&A's best bits.  Opie and Anthony's best bits.  Favorite show intro. 
[00:01:30]  Hey, we don't all sound that dumb.  Number five.  A couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Complete whores.  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Insecration against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  You rocking sex. 
[00:02:00]  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Uh-oh, we're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing.  And then when they go too far, they suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we did get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while he was on vacation in Florida. 
[00:02:30]  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes.  The duo signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  The new clap of the radio. 
[00:03:00]  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up.  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I'm Opie and Anthony.  I'm going to talk to you.  Opie's who?  Big, beautiful.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Way stink.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, this is Nathaniel from The Opie and Anthony Show.  This next bit is when Anthony talks about how great marriage is and how it's a blessed 
[00:03:30]  institution and how with some hard work and elbow grease it can really work for you.  Here it is.  Let me take you on a little journey of my own, Opie, through my divorce.  Remember?  Oh, boy.  Remember, which is another battle.  I'm going to take a break now.  Remember when I was first going through it?  I got uncomfortable.  We were working at N.E.W. for a short period of time, not making too much money, to tell  you the truth, to be honest with you.  They brought us on board at a budget, and I go into divorce proceedings with that earning. 
[00:04:00]  Well, Dominic Barbera, like President Bush, extended the divorce proceedings all the way  through my contract negotiations, which was two years later, and all the way through up  until I signed a new deal, that deal that everyone talked about, because it was a very  attractive deal.  He knew how to extend the battle to his advantage. 
[00:04:30]  What?  You think it's still in my head?  You think I still mull that over on a daily friggin' basis?  It's the only time I get uncomfortable.  Well, that's what Bush did.  He extended it right through the election.  Learned from his daddy.  All right.  Oh, we're done with the speeches?  Yeah.  Why do you have to keep paying?  You shouldn't have to keep paying.  You've been divorced for a while.  It's like it should be over.  Maybe for a year or so.  Huh?  Why? 
[00:05:00]  Who?  Just in general.  Really?  Yeah.  Huh.  He's been separated and divorced for, I don't even know, like six years now.  About six years.  You still pay him.  How long are you supposed to pay alimony for?  How many years?  That's all sorted out.  In a general, is there really a time limit for people?  No.  See, the more money you make or have, the longer you'll pay.  That's pretty much how it works.  There's no rule of thumb.  No.  Except the thumb I want to plunge into my eyeball every time I think about it.  But wait, women can just go out and get a new job and stuff like that and have their 
[00:05:30]  own rent and they're still going to collect a check.  Exactly.  For doing...  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And they're not even obligated to give up the box anymore?  There you go.  Alimony wouldn't be so bad if you still had the right.  If you could take the drive over with no notice.  Yeah.  Pull out your mule and go, it looks a little dry, doesn't it?  And she's got to go, good point.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  There you go.  And then you glue the check to her forehead.  That's the way, for all couples.  Wow, they spit on the forehead and slap the check on there. 
[00:06:00]  The guy just gets screwed in all that.  Yeah.  Of course he does.  It's unbelievable.  But then the women out there want to be looked at as equals.  Of course they do.  You want to be an equal?  When a divorce happens, you go your separate ways.  You go, get a job, whatever, and the guy goes and continues what he's doing.  Especially if there's no kids.  You split the bank account down the middle.  See, you don't go to the bank and withdraw all the money out of the bank.  No.  You don't go to the bank.  Can I?  All right.  All right.  We're going there?  Because I was with you that day, and I've got to tell you, it was the funniest and saddest 
[00:06:30]  day I've ever spent with Anthony.  Oh, my God.  The funniest and saddest day.  I was in shock.  Anthony and I are doing this radio show, and all hell is going on behind the scenes with  his personal life, and it's getting very obvious that there was going to be lawyers involved  and stuff.  So I look at Anthony one day as we're getting ready for the show, literally a half hour before  the show, and I go, Ant, how much money you got in your bank account, that joint account  of yours, and what was it, honestly? 
[00:07:00]  It was, Opie, it was every penny I had saved in my entire life.  Right.  At that point in my life.  It was every cent I had saved in my whole life, and it was a grand total of 40 large.  40,000.  40 Gs.  So I go, Ant, how much money?  Which was, you know, for me, especially since up until, you know, a few years before that,  before I even got into radio, before I came to NEW, I had, like, nothing.  I was working for a living with, you know, if I could keep 1,200 bucks in my bank account,  it was a miracle. 
[00:07:30]  You know what's so pathetic?  We kicked ass in Boston, and we both came home with barely bank accounts.  Yeah, I had nothing.  I had, like, maybe 30,000, 40,000 as well.  That job gave me the privilege of paying off some credit card debt.  That was pretty much it, and not even all the credit card debt.  We came to New York with really not much money in the bank and stuff, so I'm looking at Anthony,  I'm like, how much money is in that joint account of yours, you know?  And he's like, I don't know, about 40,000.  I'm like, dude, you know, she's getting lawyers involved, it looks like.  Why don't we go to the bank?  This is a true story.  I was the one who told you.  I go, why don't we go to the bank, and why don't you take some of that money out? 
[00:08:00]  And you being the good guy, I swear this is the truth.  The bank goes, you know what, I will go, and I'm going to take half the money out.  I'm going to take 20 grand.  I figured I'm going to go and take 20 grand out.  Because I'm a good guy.  I'm going to take half out and leave the other half for her.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh, I get there, I write out my little withdrawal slip.  It was so funny and so sad, and I'm sitting there as Ant's doing the withdrawal slip and  stuff.  $20,000 withdrawal.  Here's my account number.  Let me get my ID.  I walk up to the counter. 
[00:08:30]  Hello.  How are you today?  Give it a little slip.  Does some typing.  Looks at the monitor.  I'm there, you know, clearing out some spots in my wallet.  Well, I mean, it's going to be a hell of a wad.  She's just trying to figure out if you wanted a large bills or maybe a check.  Can you see where this is headed?  Right.  Is there any mystery left in this story?  I'm sorry, Mr. Kumia.  There seems to be $42 in your account.  She took $40,000. 
[00:09:00]  She took the $40,000.  Before they even started negotiating the divorce.  The whole thing.  The whole wad.  How does that happen?  How does the judge not go, all right, well, where's it?  $120,000 of that money.  Not only does that happen, but then you have to go to court, and then they have to tell  you how much out of now the pay that you're getting, that money's gone.  Now I have to re-save and try to build up my account again, but out of the money that  I'm making, money's got to come out of that to go to her.  As like support payments, they call it. 
[00:09:30]  And that's what you've got to go through.  Not only did I take your $40,000, but I'm going to have to pay out of your paycheck.  This is what happens to a man in a divorce.  They get screwed over.  It's an amazing thing that you have to go through.  It's amazing.  And there are options to that, and sometimes some guys don't want to get raked over the  coals, so they figure, well, maybe a rowboat and an anchor and a little fishing expedition.  Is that Chris Rockspit?  Oh, yeah.  You understand. 
[00:10:00]  I understand.  I wouldn't kill her, but I understand.  But I understand.  You're talking about O.J. Simpson.  So, Jim, I'm sitting in the bank, and I know what's going on just from the body language.  I start laughing harder than I've ever laughed.  Oh, he's laughing at me.  Inside.  Inside.  And then I've got to be there for my pal.  I'm out 40 Gs.  And then I look at him, and then I was really sad for him.  But I started laughing, and then I'm like, oh, my God, I cannot believe what's going on.  You know what I looked like when we were walking back to the studio?  He didn't even have money for lunch.  And we're becoming big radio stars in New York.  At that point, Anthony had absolutely no money to his name except what he had in his wallet, 
[00:10:30]  which I don't think he had much of the other day.  Let me tell you.  Let me give you a visual of what I looked like walking back.  Picture the scene in Jaws where Sheriff Brody is trying to get the mayor to sign that paper  after the last shark attack.  And the mayor's like, my son was in that water, too.  Just sign it.  Close the beaches.  I was sitting there, but I was doing it for the citizens. 
[00:11:00]  That was me.  I was gone.  I had 40 Gs.  I was a kid.  I can't do a show.  We could go old school.  You look like Dr. Bellows.  Dr. Bellows.  Remember Dr. Bellows from I Dream of Jeannie?  Yeah.  Whenever he would always see Jeannie appear or disappear, and Tony was trying to explain  to him what happened.  And he's like, but.  And then I looked, and there was a woman.  And then when I came, she was gone, but the box was in, and all of a sudden, and you came  in, and all of a sudden, but that was gone, and I, that was me. 
[00:11:30]  Just confusion.  Oh, it was awful.  I had no clue what to do.  None.  The best part about that whole thing was when she was claiming that she made you a radio  star.  What?  That she had something to do with it.  It, it, once you get into court.  It was amazing.  Once you get into court when you're divorced, getting a divorce, the lawyer for the wife  will always.  I had to hand over old tapes of our shows at BAB, because she was trying to prove that  she helped Anthony's career.  They try to get what's called future earnings. 
[00:12:00]  Ah.  So what the lawyer will do is say, all right, your, your earning potential for the rest of  your life is X amount of dollars, and she has a right to some of that money.  So they will give a percentage to her based on what you might earn in the future.  And you've got to pay that.  That's why I, you know, decided to settle.  And that's what happened.  But they, how are they going to screw you?  And I'm trying to say, look, I might not make a dime. 
[00:12:30]  You know, I might be, do something stupid on our show and get fired.  That's exactly what happened.  You know?  So it's, the laws for divorce are so screwed.  Yep.  So many guys get raked over the coals.  I'm lucky because, you know, yeah, it cost me a lot of money.  But at least I make a good wage.  You know?  It's not like I'm, I'm the guy making, you know, $30,000 and you got to give a half.  Now you're living on $15,000.  You know?  That's pretty rough.  That is really rough. 
[00:13:00]  But that, for some reason, yeah, we want to be equals.  I don't want the corporate glass ceiling.  I want to make as much, you know.  We want to be respected in the corporate world.  We want this, that.  You want it?  Then, then, then, no more divorce laws that are against the guys.  All the time.  What?  Huh?  What?  It gets a little uncomfortable.  They don't contribute creatively ever.  Here's what they should say in court.  How big is his bag? 
[00:13:30]  All right, you drained it a little bit.  That's what you contributed to the relationship.  There you go.  Weigh my bag.  You're a bag drainer.  All women are bag drainers.  Another scene out of Jaws.  Quint, I'll never get married again.  It's like putting on that life jacket.  After you're swimming around, watching people get plucked off.  He bobbed up and down and then turned over.  He was bitten in half at the waist.  His wife did it.  Took half the son of a bitch.  I'll never get married again. 
[00:14:00]  Paycheck goes in the water.  Wife's in the water.  My wife.  Farewell and a dude to half of your pay.  Awful.  Yeah.  Here she comes.  Look out.  We're going to need a bigger paycheck. 
[00:14:30]  I don't want to open the shark and have that settlement spill out all over the dock.  Oh, brother.  And you will pay that alibi.  God damn, yeah.  Wow.  Dragged me under like that little Kittner boy.  I'll say.  All right. 
[00:15:00]  What do we got next, man?  She can't stay down with three alimony checks in her pocket.  Wife came in looking for my check with black eyes, lifeless eyes, like a doll's eyes.  Hear that horrible high-pitched screaming and hollering as she takes your check.  Everyone just keeps pounding, pounding.  Sometimes she goes away.  Sometimes she don't go away. 
[00:15:30]  Just hear that pounding and horrible high-pitched screaming, come in and tear your paycheck to pieces.  Wow.  It's August 2002.  Let's drink to your lawyer.  Let's drink to my lawyer.  All of a sudden, Okie Bar, Boston, fat lawyer come in, grab my paycheck, pours it out of my pocket.  Check this out. 
[00:16:00]  Steve from New Hampshire.  Guys definitely get screwed in a divorce.  F yeah.  Get this.  My wife left me for the lesbian next door.  Oh, that's a cute story.  And somehow in New Hampshire, when that happens, it's not considered adultery.  Can you imagine if I did the same thing?  Wow.  If you leave for a lesbian next door, it's not adultery?  In New Hampshire, I guess.  If you're a chick.  Ah, there.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, sure.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, it's Travis from The Opie and Anthony Show, and you are listening to the best bits since coming to XM. 
[00:16:30]  Up next is Anthony's bad day driving to work.  Anthony had to take his girlfriend's car into work, and apparently she's a big fan of Gwen Stefani,  and Anthony did not know how to get Gwen Stefani off the radio.  And as E-Rock would say, hilarity ensues.  Check it out on The Opie and Anthony Show.  I got a call from Anthony around, I don't know.  I'm not your keeper, by the way.  I just like informing people if I'm going to be a little tardy to the show, and you're the only number I have.  It was very, very nice, actually. 
[00:17:00]  But anyway, I get a call from you around 5, 5, 10.  I don't even know that you're going to be late.  Yeah.  It was an angry phone call from a gas pump in Queens.  And it's 12 degrees out.  It's not a morning to pump gas.  I have things set up the way I like things.  It's not a morning to leave the house here in New York.  This would have been a great day to call in sick.  You know, living my life the way I do, and have in the past, and where I've gotten in life, doing what I do, I've earned certain things, I believe. 
[00:17:30]  I worked hard for living for many years, Opie, in the construction industry.  You're scaring me, because we've never worked hard in radio.  No, no, no, this is the dream job.  We haven't earned crap.  No, no, I just mean life in general.  That's why I didn't say in this career.  We just happen to have a really good chemistry that's, I don't know, and it's working. 
[00:18:00]  But we haven't worked hard at this.  No, no, not at all.  I mean, in life in general, me, myself, I have worked, I had a real job, you know.  I was doing construction.  I was in this type of cold, frigid weather, where a house is nothing but two-by-fours, and you've got to put in duct work, and it's freezing cold, and you don't want to be there, and you're humping stuff, and there's ice, and it stinks.  And I did that.  But you know something, throughout life, I have been afforded certain things, and now, I just don't have to deal with certain things, one of which is pumping gas in the freezing cold. 
[00:18:30]  I don't like doing it.  So what I do is I keep my car garaged, make sure it's full of gas, and then when I leave, I don't even have to deal with the outside world, only the little walk that I take to the studio.  That's the only time you're outside all day?  Pretty much.  Yeah, because, all right, so your car gets warmed up for you, right, while you're getting dressed? 
[00:19:00]  Well, it's in the garage.  But do you have one of those automatic...  No, the garage is, like, heated.  Oh, all right, I got you.  So I get in, open the garage.  Look at you with a heated garage.  Like I said, I have certain things that I have now that I never dreamt I would have, and that's one of them.  How do you get gas?  Like on the way home or something.  It's not, you know, I don't need it balmy.  I don't have to drive to the Caribbean to fuel up.  But, you know, the sun on you is one thing.  But when it's 4 in the morning, 4.30 in the morning, and it's 5 degrees out, it's just cold. 
[00:19:30]  Are we looking at a garage diva here?  Garage diva.  How warm do you keep your garage?  It's not, like, heated where there's a vent in there, but, like, the water heater and stuff is in the garage.  So it's warm enough.  So it's warm enough, you know.  It's, like, probably, it's probably, I don't know, almost 60 degrees in there, which is fine.  You know, and then you turn your heat on.  Very nice.  I enjoy the warmth.  And, well, let's just say I have some company over the house. 
[00:20:00]  There seems to be a family emergency with my girlfriend, my girlfriend's family, and her sister and husband are down and staying at my place.  And they also have kids.  There's two boys and a little infant-type baby girl.  Can I preface this?  Yes.  For the new listeners.  Yes.  Anthony absolutely hates kids.  I.  No ands, ifs, or buts about it. 
[00:20:30]  Anthony cannot stand kids.  You know what the extent of kids is in my life that I enjoy?  If you see one being pushed in a carriage or something and you go, oh, goo-goo-doo-doo, and then walk away.  I, I, I could appreciate my.  Do you actually do the goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo?  No, I think it.  Oh, you know?  Because I don't think anyone actually.  No, no one does that.  Okay.  It's, it's, it's, do you have a rattle in the back pocket where you just, when you see kids?  I, I try to make believe they're not there, is what I do. 
[00:21:00]  That's it.  And, and, and they're staying over.  And, um, well, this morning, the, the, their vehicle was in my, my driveway behind my,  uh, my garage door.  So I could not get my.  Truck.  My truck out.  Uh, like, uh, you know, I get in, it's warm.  I, so I had to take my, my girlfriend's vehicle, which is out in the driveway in, in the freezing  cold.  By the way, there's a trucker checking in from Minnesota. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Pretty much saying, stop bitching about 12 degrees in New York.  It's a negative 48 in Minnesota.  That's why I don't live in that frozen tundra.  Ugh.  Minnesota.  No.  12 is cold enough.  It's plenty cold.  After 12, 12, 48 below.  Does it matter?  Does it really matter?  So I get, I get, I get in the girlfriend's vehicle.  And I have no idea how anything works in it.  And it's pitch black and, and I can't even, I can't figure anything out.  And I'm trying to drive now.  It's freezing cold in there before it heats up. 
[00:22:00]  And I can't figure out the radio.  So like Gwen Stefani is just blasting and I can't change the, and I mean blasting.  And it's early in the morning.  And now I can't even, I can't shut it off.  I can't change the station because now I'm really late.  And I'm driving, it's, I am freaking out.  I can't adjust the mirrors.  I don't even know how to adjust the mirrors.  So I can't see anything behind me.  I'm driving, freezing cold, loud Gwen Stefani. 
[00:22:30]  Now I'm on the expressway.  You honestly couldn't figure out where the volume controls are?  I couldn't figure out.  It's like, it's like the glass cockpit of a brand new fighter jet.  There's no knobs.  There's no nothing.  It's all touchscreen, glass screen thing.  Oh yeah.  This thing is like the future.  I'm surprised it doesn't fly.  Oh, sorry.  Not loud enough.  It was blasting and I couldn't turn it down.  And there I am.  Hey, here I am driving down the expressway. 
[00:23:00]  How do I turn this down?  How do I turn it down?  Oh my God.  I'm freezing.  Oh stop.  I can't take it.  I'm freezing cold.  One thing I did hear though.  Low fuel.  Low fuel. 
[00:23:30]  What?  What?  What?  My mule?  What are you saying vehicle?  I don't understand you.  Low fuel.  Low fuel.  I wish I could listen to 1010 Winds.  So I know what's going on for the show.  But I gotta hear Gwen Stefani on 11.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:24:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  This is my drive in.  Oh, it's only quarter to five in the morning.  I like listening to loud dance music at a quarter to five in the morning.  Stop.  Please stop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then now I have to stop for gas, which is my nightmare early in the morning when it's  12 degrees out. 
[00:24:30]  So I pull into the gas station.  And of course, it sounds minor, but when you ever been so livid that anything new thrown  into the situation will just freak you out.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  I pull in.  And of course, the gas cap's on the opposite side of my vehicle.  So now I got to get back in.  And I've already slid the credit card through.  So now I got to, I can't just go to the other side.  I got to kind of U-turn around.  And I go to open up the gas cap. 
[00:25:00]  I have no idea how to open up the gas thing.  And I am now, and I'm just tick tock, tick tock.  Time is ticking away.  This is show prep time.  I'm picturing everyone sitting here, Ben herking at his computer.  Hope he's going through the papers.  Norton's still sleeping because he's not in until six.  So my girlfriend gets this call from my cell phone.  She picks up the phone.  Hello? 
[00:25:30]  Where the fuck's the gas cap?  Release the thing.  Shit.  Oh, baby, I don't know.  I've never fueled it up.  Ah!  I'll find it!  Damn it!  Click.  That was my call to her at about five this morning.  And you know what really ticked me off?  There is no thing.  You just do it with your hand.  Are you serious? 
[00:26:00]  You just pull the flap up with your hand.  But every new vehicle and mine has a little thing inside.  They went back to old school.  They went old school on me.  And it threw me for a loop.  So now I think the only saving grace is it was a self-serve pump with a little thing that keeps the gas flowing.  So you should jump back in the car, right?  So, no, I could just put my hands in my pocket while I called Opie.  Oh, it's me.  I'm putting gas in my car in Queens!  Really? 
[00:26:30]  You thought you'd announce that to me.  I was like, what?  Why are you yelling at me?  I'm like, whatever, dude.  All right, we'll be here.  I'm nice and warm.  It's about 80 degrees in our office.  We'll try not to start the show without you.  Yeah.  And I'm just a livid idiot.  Oh, so I was just...  And I got no sleep, really, last night because I got to bed very late.  Kids around the house.  And there's a toddler around there which just has me, like, freaking out because my house, I pretty much have... 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, keep them away from the rotating saw blades that I have because the image of a child in this place just never crossed my mind.  You were telling me in the office there's three kids running around?  Yeah.  Two little ones and an infant that's just starting to walk?  Two boys that are, I guess, like six, seven, eight-ish around there.  This is your hell.  This is your hell on earth.  Yeah, and a girl who's, like, I guess one, maybe, just, like, just starting to walk, running around my glass coffee table with sharp corners on it.  And then yesterday, I'm on the computer, and the parents go, oh, come here, come here. 
[00:27:30]  The kid is holding a pair of scissors.  The little one-year-old girl has scissors that I just leave laying around to open up, like, boxes and stuff because it's not childproof.  Here's the kid.  No!  Scissors!  And where was Randy Quaid while all this was going on? 
[00:28:00]  No!  Are you saying it's like vacation?  Was he in the kitchen with his dickie and his little moose cup having some eggnog?  They do live upstate, though.  Took a long trip down here.  You want to put an end to that problem, you ought to hire a fat clown from Chicago to come over and entertain.  Oh, my God.  And, yeah, so the girl runs around and just finds every single dangerous thing in my apartment, which there are plenty of, you know?  There's two adults living there.  It's very hard to baby. 
[00:28:30]  You don't baby-proof things, you know?  I got, like, bleach and brandy snifters laying on the floor for some reason, you know, and I didn't even realize it, but there it is.  I didn't even know that was there until the baby goes to take a swig.  And the boys just like to, for some reason, boys, at the drop of a hat, just want to run around and go,  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:29:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  All right, we got it.  We got it.  No, no, no.  Let me do it another half hour.  Then you might start understanding it.  Maybe.  But probably not.  Maybe an hour, two hours.  Dude.  I just sit on my computer and just...  Then the girl finds this thing that's been stuck to my refrigerator for five years, probably. 
[00:29:30]  It's a little happy birthday cake.  I had no idea what it ever did.  Didn't think it did anything.  Just held postcards on there.  That's all it ever did for five years.  Do you know what it does when you press the button?  Happy birthday to you.  That's nice.  That's all it does.  That's nice.  You know what happens when you press the button 10,000 times?  Huh.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you. 
[00:30:00]  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  I've always made it clear I don't want children.  You hate kids.  I never want children.  Don't you have stuff that they can play with?  This is such a cool reminder.  Yeah, scissors.  Whatever they want to grab from an open box or something.  I'm petrified when they run around the house because, like I said, I don't care. 
[00:30:30]  I have just, for no reason at all, I guess about three weeks ago, I took a frayed wire  and just plugged it in the wall and left the two ends just hanging there because I like it.  Apparently, I'd forgotten about it.  You know, come over and grab it.  I don't know what I have in my house.  It's just dangerous.  I know it's dangerous.  You're bringing back your memory because my sister will drop her kid off at my house every once in a while.  Like, hey, I got a couple errands. 
[00:31:00]  Do you mind watching JD?  I'm like, yeah, no problem, you know.  And then after me and the kid stare at each other, and I love the kid, we stare at each other for about 10 minutes.  And, all right, what do you want to do?  And he's like, you got anything to play with here?  I'm like, didn't Mommy give you some toys to play with while she does her errands?  No.  And we're sitting on the couch, and, I mean, you can only have a five-minute conversation with a five-, six-year-old, right?  I'm like, well, you like video games? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  All right, try this.  And this is an old story, but I threw in Grand Theft Auto for him.  Oh, my God.  So then you fast-forward an hour because now I'm doing my thing because it's kind of like, you know,  you let the TV babysit the kid, I learned, a long time ago.  Yes.  Whether you throw a cartoon on or Grand Theft Auto, it works.  They're quiet.  They're sitting in front of the TV enjoying themselves, and you can go do whatever you have to do.  That's pretty much what I wound up doing.  So you fast-forward a half-hour, 40 minutes, and my sister comes in the house and is like,  Greg, what the fuck are you doing?  And I'm like, what? 
[00:32:00]  I come running in the living room, and there's JD.  He figures out how to use the guns and how to pick up prostitutes.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Playing the game?  Well, because I figured, I gave him the basics.  Like, you know, you jump in this car here.  And drive it around.  Drive around the city a little bit.  It's cool, right?  And I'm thinking a five-, six-year-old, he's never going to get past that stage.  I come in, and he's just blowing people away.  Figuring it out.  He's picking up the prostitutes.  He's figured out the whole game.  Oh, man.  And I didn't know this.  And my sister just walks into my house, you know, and that's what she sees, and she just 
[00:32:30]  starts cursing me out.  I'm like, what?  What are you doing?  Like, next time, maybe, you know, leave toys with him.  I don't know.  Oh.  Yeah, you just wind up throwing videos in, you know.  We have some videos laying around that they can watch.  You know, here, watch Full Metal Jacket, kid.  What the hell?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  You know, yeah, you got videos, but do you have videos for kids?  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  And when you're desperate, you'll be like, ah, that's all right. 
[00:33:00]  How many complete nude scenes are even in this movie?  You know, it's not hardcore stuff.  What the hell?  About time the little fella learned about trannies.  Yeah.  All right.  Pop this in.  Thank you, Yoshi.  Yeah, Yoshi.  I love throat pudding, whatever it is.  Yeah.  Throat yogurt.  Throat yogurt.  I don't know.  I'm sure there's a throat pudding also.  Yeah, but it was terribly directed.  A message to Yoshi.  We love you, but enough with the porno. 
[00:33:30]  That's for Opie.  Wow.  I got it.  People love the porno.  I have a stack of porno that he gave us.  I'm only through the first one.  For Norton, continue sending.  Of course.  And for Anthony.  All right.  Well, that's.  Might have more kids dropping by.  Well, that's quite funny, Anthony.  Oh, it's just been, you know, one of those.  I didn't get to sleep last night.  I think about, I think about 2.30 this morning, I heard, you know, from like the room, the 
[00:34:00]  guest room.  Dude, I didn't.  Am I hearing that?  I didn't get to sleep because, and actually, I'm going to throw myself under a bus again  today, but Ben witnessed this firsthand.  Yeah.  I discovered Solitaire on my trio.  You know, and you just got a new top-of-the-line computer.  Oh, I know.  And you play Solitaire on your trio. 
[00:34:30]  That's the problem.  These simple games are the ones that are the problems.  Like the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.  I got it.  Yeah.  Love it.  But I discovered Solitaire on my trio.  I didn't go to bed until I beat the game.  And it took hours.  You get obsessed with these games.  I got OCD when it comes to video games.  I can't put the game down.  I was in the middle of the Jets game this weekend.  Ben came over with a few people, and I'm sitting on the couch playing game after game 
[00:35:00]  after game on this trio.  And I get mesmerized, and I cannot put the game down.  Yeah, you're crazy.  And I get it in my head.  I can't stop playing until I beat the game.  And it's stupid Solitaire.  You can't just shut it off.  You can't shut it off.  Watch the football game.  So around 11.30 last night, I'm usually in bed by 9.  Yeah.  I finally beat the game, and I can go to bed for my five hours.  Because then, you know, you're up at 4 or whatever.  Uh-huh.  And so it's a horrendous obsession I have with these stupid, simple games. 
[00:35:30]  I need the full-blown graphics.  Oh, yeah.  I love that, too.  But for some reason, that's why I'm tired today.  You're a lonely man.  The stupidest thing.  That's sad.  Do you use your little stylus?  Oh, yeah, I do.  Beep.  Beep.  Over and over and over again.  Like something just keeps clicking in my brain, and I can't turn it off.  Do you chew on your stylus?  No, no.  I don't do any of that.  Big, gnarly, chewed-up stylus. 
[00:36:00]  Why don't you just get some real cards?  Oh, there you go.  No, that's too much work.  Too much work.  It's fun, though.  You need a surface.  Dude, with the trio solitaire, you don't even have to put the cards on the aces.  They do it for you.  Does it all by itself.  The worst is when you play solitaire on the bed, and you kneel, and all the cards kind  of come in towards your leg.  Into your knee.  Yeah.  You mess up all the piles.  You actually play the real solitaire?  It's the only way a man does it.  Does anyone play real solitaire anymore?  No.  I think not. 
[00:36:30]  You play chess on the computer?  Yeah, I'd rather play with a person, because the computer is just, for me, unbeatable.  Pretty rough.  You can go online, though, and play with other people online.  That's too creepy.  Yeah, that's creepy online.  If I'm on a computer, would you come over and take a leak on me?  Absolutely.  That's not creepy.  I stopped playing chess online.  I told this story, too.  I got into chess again, and I started playing online, you know, because I don't have anyone  around to really play.  Yeah.  So I'm in, like, kind of a, I don't know, I don't know. 
[00:37:00]  Chess chatroom kind of playing?  Yeah, but I'm trying to think, not, like, beginner, kind of, I don't know.  Novice.  Eh, intermediate.  Intermediate.  Somewhere in the chicken hog.  Kind of intermediate, I guess, you know?  And I'm beating these people left and right, and I'm, like, just, I'm thinking I'm, like,  a chess champion again, you know?  Because I used to take it a little, kind of serious when I was, when I was a lot younger.  And then, you know, that stupid chat feature.  Yeah.  Hey, you're pretty good, because I was playing the same person over and over again. 
[00:37:30]  But in general, winning a lot of games.  And this guy goes, hey, you're pretty good.  How old are you?  And I'm like, well, how old are you?  Uh-oh.  I'm eight.  Eight.  I'm like, that's it.  I'm effing done.  Because it wasn't like I was totally killing the kid.  I was, you know, I was winning, but, you know, it took a little, some effort.  I'm like, I'm playing eight-year-olds online.  I'll meet you.  Yeah.  7-11.  My treat.  So now I can't admit my real age, because it would be way creepy. 
[00:38:00]  So I'm like, I'm 15.  Aw.  If you're ever putting I'm 15 into a computer.  Oh, I know.  Turn yourself in.  So I was just, it just got too creepy.  And that was the end of my online chess.  I'm like, it's all little kids just learning how to play.  Did you drive over his house and give him a T-shirt?  Yeah.  Keep the cop.  So I don't do that anymore.  Jim from the Poconos.  Go ahead.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Anthony, you got to do what I do. 
[00:38:30]  When it's time for bed, hey, Uncle Anthony's got to go to bed.  Everybody go to bed.  Aw, I got to be the killjoy.  Time to go to bed.  And, uh, Opie, you either need to get a girlfriend or a hooker, because something's going on with you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I have a question for Anthony.  Why didn't you, like this morning, why didn't you just get these people out of bed and say,  move, or get the keys and say, move your truck?  I got to go.  You know why?  It just would have taken too long.  I know I was going to be late.  I didn't want to be ridiculously late. 
[00:39:00]  And I can't, you know, I can't depend that someone's going to jump out of bed, just grab whatever's around,  and then get in the truck and back it out of the driveway.  Oh, I thought he was just too busy, empty in the septic tank.  No, it's not.  It's not a motor home.  Oh, all right.  I'm still convinced Randy Quaid's staying at your house.  Are they going to be there for a long time, hopefully?  Stop it.  I mean, it's fantastic.  Yeah, I'm hoping, because this was the easiest 40 minutes of radio I've done in years. 
[00:39:30]  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  It's family.  It's important.  Look, I'm fine with them staying there.  I don't have a problem with that.  Really?  It's just certain things that I'm used to and have become accustomed to in my life without children.  You're really fine with that, huh?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm just wondering.  They may listen to the replay later.  Yeah.  Ixnay.  Of course.  I'm fine with it.  It's too bad we didn't have audio rolling in the office about 5 o'clock, 5.15.  I didn't say anything except what I have said on the air, my friend. 
[00:40:00]  No.  I am very...  I'm just trying to cause trouble.  Look, I'm set in my ways, and it's, you know, when I, when I, because I had my garage  door was going up.  I was in my vehicle.  I started it up.  I put it in reverse.  Look in the rear view mirror, and there's two headlights staring at me, you know?  So it was kind of like, now it's a big thing.  Because I like just getting in, and then you go.  Now the second I got to shut her down and get out, now there's a problem. 
[00:40:30]  Now there's a problem.  And it started my day, that started my day wrong.  Did you have the one moment where you wanted to just open their bedroom door and scream,  get your effing vehicle out of my way?  You're listening to O.P.A. Anthony's Best Business Ever.

Anthony had some family over.  Some of that family happened to be young kids.  They wiped a booger on his couch, and Anthony, being the germaphobe that he is, had to throw  out the entire couch, which was fairly new.  It's the Booger Couch on the Best Bits of O&A. 
[00:44:00]  At least I was able to get my vehicle out of the garage today.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, we need an update on that.  How's the...  Oh, houseguests gone.  Out?  They left.  Left last night.  But not before one more little thing happened.  My girlfriend's sister and her husband and three kids were over.  Two boys, about, you know, seven, I guess six, seven, something like that, and then a  girl who's like one year old.  Just figuring out how to walk, right? 
[00:44:30]  A little toddler, just figuring that teetering toddler walk around my sharp-edged furniture  and tile floors, like no carpet on some of the floors that I have.  It's just like concrete tile.  Just waiting to go down.  Oh, just waiting to leave a dent in that soft spot.  Just awful.  I have the most dangerous baby house ever.  So, you know, my girlfriend's sister and the younger boy and the girl went shopping, 
[00:45:00]  which left me at the house with the husband and the older boy.  It's like seven years old around there.  And we're watching a movie.  We're all sitting on the couch watching a movie.  And you're, I'm thinking, you're thinking that, ah, this isn't too bad.  I'm sitting here.  Not too bad.  I have no idea what you're about to say, but I know.  They're not screaming around the house.  I know it's going to be bad, but you're sitting there maybe enjoying a beer, bonding a little  bit with the dude and his older son, right?  You know, I was just watching the movie with them. 
[00:45:30]  Just sitting watching the movie.  No small talk?  No, you know, I like watching movies.  When a movie's on, I like just watching the movie.  I don't like a lot of talk during movies, to tell you the truth.  I just want to watch.  You have nothing in common with this guy.  No, no.  Hey, man, I can read between the lines.  You don't have to say a thing, Anthony.  I'm an all-around kind of guy.  I talk to all people. 
[00:46:00]  How long did it take when your girlfriend left with her sister and the two other kids  where you realized, uh-oh, I better find a movie?  No, actually, he brought in some movies.  Brought in some movies.  All right.  So maybe he's thinking the same thing.  Sure.  You know, just pop a movie in.  Makes things easy.  So we're watching the movie, and he asks his son, he goes,  What are you doing?  So I'm sitting there like, I'm just watching the movie, watching the movie. 
[00:46:30]  He goes, I'm picking my nose.  You know, kids, they don't care.  They'll just say anything.  He goes, I'm picking my nose.  And then I hear, did you wipe that on Anthony's couch?  You're hanging out with Randy Quaid and his kids.  Dude, dude.  Dude.  So they packed up the RV and got out of town.  Fuck that.  And the kid goes, yup.  Yup.  What were you honestly thinking inside? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, my God.  The kid just wiped a booger on my couch.  Because you hate, I mean, no one likes that type of thing, but you absolutely, dude, you lose your mind.  We have audio of me saying, snot, besides crap, snot is the most disgusting thing in life to me.  I can't handle it.  If I blow my nose, I can't look at my own.  I have to be in front of a mirror when I blow my nose to make sure every bit is gone. 
[00:47:30]  You never ate your own booger?  Oh, God.  Damn, no, never.  See, I just want to get a reaction.  Never, ever, ever.  Not once?  Nope.  Snot has always disgusted me, even as a small child.  I freak out.  I've said it on this show many times.  I can't stand it.  And when he goes, what are you doing?  And the kid goes, pick up my nose.  Did you just wipe a booger on Anthony's couch?  Yup. 
[00:48:00]  And then he goes, well, find it.  So now the kid is searching between the crack and the couch trying to find his booger.  And I'm just, I'm, I'm blocked on the movie.  I'm not looking at it.  I'm like, I cannot, I cannot function.  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't speak.  I'm just watching, I guess it was, yeah, the day after tomorrow. 
[00:48:30]  That was the one on the New York movie.  I thought you were watching Boogie Nights.  That's a booger.  That's a baby.  That's a baby.  That's zany.  No, it was the day after tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Never, by the way, never found the booger.  Nice.  So now.  Knowing you, you're going to throw the whole couch out.  Much like Seinfeld.  Yeah.  I have to throw my couch out. 
[00:49:00]  I didn't even have to ask.  I know if someone's looking for a really nice couch with one lousy booger in it somewhere.  With a booger somewhere.  We should just give the address of where you're living, and they can come by with a truck and pick it up.  Take it away free of charge.  It's all yours.  I know you, and he's not lying.  Oh, I will have a new couch as soon as possible.  That couch is gone.  Because, first of all, I can sit on it, but I can only sit on an area that's nowhere near the Ground Zero booger area. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  And as far as laying down and reclining on it, over that crack, you know, the modular crack that it was in.  But do you realize what other stuff is on your couch?  Seriously, have you had people sleep over and stuff?  Yeah.  I got foreign stains on my couch, and I'm like, what the hell are people doing on this couch when they sleep over?  Really?  Oh, my God.  You mean couples are sleeping on your couch?  Um... 
[00:50:00]  Because then they are having sex on your couch.  Right, exactly.  And making...  Yeah.  Exactly.  That is probably the rudest thing you can do when staying over some of those, especially sleeping on the couch.  There's a bender over the coffee table or something that could be, you know, cleaned with some Windex.  And stupid me, I got a very light-colored couch, so everything...  You know, you got a brown couch, eh, do what you want on it, I'll never see it.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's an off-white kind of thing.  Mine's like a light gray with a green booger somewhere on it.  But I have no clue where it is. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, that is gross, man.  Yeah, people that stay over your house and do things like that, having sex on your couch, that's pretty rude.  Well, there was two, like, nasty spots.  I thought it was the old splooge stains.  Yeah.  But I scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed, and they're still there, so now I'm thinking it might be just a little grease from Chinese food or something.  Thank God.  You think?  Well, what else could it be?  It could be splooge.  Nah, I think you can wash that out.  No, no, that don't come out.  There's that little border area of the stain that won't come out, where it's kind of wicked to the side, and all the proteins and everything kind of collected on the edge of it. 
[00:51:00]  Chris the Trucker wants in on this.  Chris, go ahead, buddy.  Yeah, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Can you hear me?  Of course I can.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Chris.  He can't hear me.  Oh, come on.  Buttons.  Chris.  Buttons.  Yeah, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, hey.  That's the only one you know about.  What about the rest of the house? 
[00:51:30]  Oh, the kids?  Yeah, maybe for two days they were there.  You had three kids there?  Maybe they were wiping boogers everywhere.  Yeah, hey, I got four kids, and I tell you, they do a little bit of sick of everything.  Yep, time to find a new house, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Time to get a maid service in there and clean up the whole thing.  There you go.  You should have seen.  That's true, actually.  There's probably boogers all over your house.  Oh, my God.  You should have seen my girlfriend going nuts.  She went around the house with disinfectant stuff and cleaning stuff, and I was like, what are you doing? 
[00:52:00]  She goes, kids with meat hands just touching everything, like freaking out.  She's a vegetarian, but not crazy vegetarian, where if she sees me eating a burger or something, she's going to freak out.  But the fact that the kids, you know how kids are when they eat like hamburgers?  It just gets all over their hands.  And then they're walking around, like touching stuff, and she doesn't want to be grabbing a faucet, you know, and just have this greasy burger juice out of the faucet. 
[00:52:30]  So she's running around like a mad woman.  Tina, clean this up.  You guys are like that couple from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  Margo and that other dude.  Really?  Yeah, the neighbors.  I don't remember that.  It's all about just you two.  You don't want any kids around.  We are.  You don't want anyone touching your stuff.  We are the most selfish people.  What's the other guy's name in that?  Because I know the famous line is, I don't know Margo. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Oh, Todd.  Todd?  You're Todd and Margo.  Todd and Margo.  From National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  I consider myself like a generous person when it comes to, like, what I have.  Things like that.  Then I'm fine.  But we are two of the most selfish, self-centered people when it just comes to our own convenience and things.  Like, we enjoy just leave us alone.  Any little shaking up of my daily routines just gets me crazy. 
[00:53:30]  You guys are better known as loners.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  We have our life and that's what we enjoy.  I don't want boogers on my couch.  She doesn't want grease on the faucets.  Yeah.  Well, no.  The computer was pretty good. 
[00:54:00]  I think they knew that was pretty much, you know, off limits.  That's my salvation there.  Although I'm trying to play, like, Battlefield 1942.  And, you know, he, like, the little kid likes watching, which is fine.  But occasionally, like, I'm trying to do stuff.  And he's so close that he's, like, bumping my arm.  And I'm trying to kill somebody.  And, like, I miss.  And I'm just creamed.  Look over.  Oh, man.  Maybe you shouldn't bump my arm while I'm trying to kill the gook here. 
[00:54:30]  You were in hell for two or three days.  I just know you were definitely in hell.  Oh, the kids all left last, you know, they all left last night.  Yeah.  And after they all left, I was like, oh, what was that, a week?  Oh, that's brutal.  And my chick's like, no, it's, you know, two days.  Yeah.  We're not like company people.  I know, man.  You don't have to tell me.  You know, we have still two full rooms that just have nothing in them. 
[00:55:00]  The living room itself.  You don't even set them up for it?  The formal living room.  They're not even set up for company.  Yeah, nothing.  It's a wide expanse of carpeting with nothing.  The dining room, the formal, like, dining room, nothing in there.  And that's why they had room to, ah, just run and yell through the house.  So, no, we're not meant for company.  We're not built for company.  And that's just the way it is.  Stay away.  Yeah, we're like, we're very inconvenient to be around.  Let's say hi to Tom in Philly. 
[00:55:30]  Tom, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing this morning?  Pretty good.  I had a suggestion for Anthony.  Next time those little shit stains come over, you're going to have Opie come over and kick  one of them in the liver.  You can't be kicking children in the liver.  Yeah, why would I do that, sir?  Why would I do that?  Chester!  All right.  All right.  All right.  What are you doing downstairs?  Mike in Kansas, what's up?  Mike? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  What's going on, Mike?  I can barely hear you.  Why?  What's going on with the volume on the phones today?  I just had a suggestion for that couch.  You could bring it into the studio there and make a new lesbian couch out of it.  The lesbian booger couch?  Yeah.  Dude, it's one booger.  Yeah, but that's quite enough.  One booger is all it takes.  So, what did the guy say?  Because finally the search had to be called off.  He just searched and the booger was called off.  It's now a recovery. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, well, the search and rescue was called off.  Yeah, called off.  And now it's just a recovery.  Well, he just said, well, apologize to Anthony.  And, you know, the kid says, I'm sorry, but, you know, the booger's still there.  Didn't the kid know where he put the booger there?  You know, kids, he dug deep and then he shoved his hand, like, between the crack and the couch  and then wiped the booger down there.  So, I guess when he looked for it, it had already probably, like, come off. 
[00:57:00]  I'm getting grossed out.  And now it's, like, under the cushion.  I'm sure if I look around, but I don't want to look around because I don't want to find it.  That's something I don't want to find.  Opie and Anthony's Best Bits.  Best audio sent in by a listener.  Are you kidding me?  Ha ha, they all suck.  Ah, right.  Manhattan mimosa.  Is this thing on?  Herc, jerk, herc, jerk, herc, jerk.  Ben Sparks is herky jerky. 
[00:57:30]  Wave his arms around like he's herky jerky.  Compulsing on the ground because he's herky jerky.  You know that he don't give a fuck.  He's herky jerky.  Don't mistake him for a bum.  Opie and on some drugs.  He's moving all around because Ben Sparks is what he does.  He's in a gossip thing because he needs to know the buzz.  He's in giggling like a girl motherfucking just because.  He's a man about town.  Find at parties on the street.  Unless he's had some crazy instant sushi to eat.  Then here comes Gravy Leg.  Better move out the way.  He'll be going through a pound of toilet paper in a day. 
[00:58:00]  And looking at his hair is going to make you stop and think.  Did he wipe it on the floor after someone spilled a drink?  If you watch how he moves, he'll be fucking.  He is smoking a crack.  Herky jerky on the phone.  Smaller than a Tic Tac in studio.  He'll be yawning during O&A show.  Because all night she's been chatting about Tom Brady.  Doing flow back and bossing them drugs.  I'll tell you best we can fix her.  Because Ben heard Curt Schilling had sex with his sister.  Ben's mule is scary, man.  He's got Superman chucks.  He's a looking man like a cancerous lump.  Now Ben is rave.  Yelling at Jim.  Yelling at O. 
[00:58:30]  Dude, relax.  Just concentrate on doing a fucking show.  That's crazy insane.  That's crazy, crazy insane.  Nah, so dude, did I tell you about Tom Brady?  Do him blow off this bitch's back.  It was fucking great.  We're all in a fucking club drinking fucking kawas.  Yeah, so dude, do you like my new hair?  I was called the Hurricaniac.  Ah, Opie, I was just fucking yawning.  I didn't have any sleep.  I was out looking at Bono under the fucking bridge.  It was fucking crazy insane.  It's not crazy insane.  It's not everybody was there.  Anyway, so I walked in.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, I had one black person.  And I was like, oh, there's no music.  There's like some cheese laid out.  My friend's talking.  Okay, we're up in there.  And it's like, I start cranking up his show a little bit.  Whoa, there's a baby who lives downstairs. 
[00:59:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, this is Nathaniel, and this is a bit where Steve and I sort of took classic bits from  the Opie and Anthony Show and edited them like they were made for network television  by putting in silly swears that didn't really make any sense for the filthy language that  takes place on this show.  I'd like to think it was funny.  Let's find out.  Yes.  We're going to do an ONA TV edit thing.  Yeah, I want to hear this.  This is Jimmy.  Jim Norton talking to Dragon Wagon, I think.  The famous Dragon Wagon bit. 
[00:59:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  No?  What?  Oh, Hawk.  Oh, he went with the other one?  What have you done?  No, they said they might go with the other one.  This is a...  But it's Hawk's fault.  It is.  It always is.  It is.  I was taking mics away from the guests.  Why are there eight people walking in here while you remove a mic from an anchor?  Here you go.  Hold on.  No, but that's his son.  Show respect to his son.  Talk it to mine.  Mine, sir?  No, no, talk it to mine.  All right, so the Dragon Wagon was a little too...  Dragon Wagon was a little too long and didn't have enough... 
[01:00:00]  Variety in the language.  Okay.  So we went with a different bit that Danny selected.  What bit is this?  Oh, I'll look at it.  Now, wait a minute.  That just was very telling.  I know what that means.  Nathaniel is not confident in this.  At all.  I have the utmost confidence.  No, you said which Danny chose.  But there's some, you know, discussion as to who contributed to what and people not getting  credit, and I think Danny selected an excellent bit.  You would absolutely not give Danny credit.  No.  Yes, I would.  You wouldn't say you did it if he didn't do it, but you wouldn't step up and actually  give him the credit. 
[01:00:30]  I have the utmost confidence in this.  All right.  What's the bit?  It's a Jim yelling at a caller that just said he wasn't funny.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  And it's done in the TV edit style.  You know how they put movies on regular television.  They've got to edit out the language, and a lot of times they use ridiculous words for  the curses.  The voice is different.  The ambient noise in the background is different, and it's ridiculous.  Right.  And we just decided to try one of these with a little segment of our show.  All right.  Here's Jim Norton, the original line.  Wait.  Oh, you killed him. 
[01:01:00]  Nathaniel wanted to say something.  Did he?  No, it's okay.  Oh, he's going off the microphone.  Fuck your ass.  But he was going to talk into the mic.  You got me so bad.  No, he actually was trying to talk into the mic, and he got shy, and he walked away.  All right.  Here's the original dialogue.  All right.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Long time listener.  Glad to have you back.  Love you.  Jeff, welcome to the program.  Hey, you've got to tell you.  You've got to get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he sucks.  What?  Let's tell you. 
[01:01:30]  Uh-oh.  That was the first line?  That's the first line, and now we're going to clean it up for...  TV?  Wow.  Steve, you have confidence in this?  Green Goblin face made a really good choice in there, didn't he?  Dumbbell.  Did you have picked one with profanity in it, Daniel?  All right.  It's just the first one.  But the whole point is you've got to clean it up, and there's nothing wrong with...  I'm thinking sucks.  All right, Steve, explain yourself.  We used, if I may make a local reference, Channel 11 rules with profanity. 
[01:02:00]  Where they couldn't use sucks?  Can't use sucks.  All right.  Let's listen to the original.  All right.  One more time.  I just got confused because I didn't know what they were going to redo here.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Long time listener.  Glad to have you back.  Love you.  Jeff, welcome to the program.  Hey, you've got to tell you.  You've got to get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he sucks.  What?  All right, so that's the original.  What a dope I am greeting him happily.  Yeah, I know.  Asshole.  You feel stupid.  I hope he's dead.  And here's that same line cleaned up for Channel 11. 
[01:02:30]  Local broadcast.  Local broadcast.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Long time listener.  Glad to have you back.  Love you.  Jeff, welcome to the program.  Hey, you've got to tell you.  You've got to get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he stinks.  What?  All right.  I kind of like it.  It was very good execution, by the way.  The sound was a little off.  The voice wasn't the same.  But his attitude was the same.  You tried to actually get the guy's angry attitude. 
[01:03:00]  This is actually a lot harder than you'd think because you have to sit there and say it.  Exactly how Norton delivers the line.  All right?  Forget it.  You really need to explain.  Nope.  Jesus.  All right, here's your answer.  My motivation was.  I know.  Every time he opens his mouth, he drains the funny from the room.  Whoa, easy there, Jeff.  I've got to tell you.  Hey, Norton.  Bob Kelly was on the other day. 
[01:03:30]  I couldn't tell the difference between him and you.  Get a new shtick, buddy.  You stole it from him.  You're a one-trick pony.  Yeah, your mother's a one-trick pony, too.  When I give her money, she sucks my dick and eats my ass.  You fucking fan with an opinion.  Your mother's a trick-turning pony.  She sucks horse cock while bad 70s music plays.  I'm a funny little troll.  God, you've just proven that he's actually funny there.  Wow.  That's not really what I meant to say.  No, no.  He just kind of slipped out. 
[01:04:00]  A little harsh.  Well, Steve cleans this up for a local broadcast.  Every time he opens his mouth, he drains the funny from the room.  Whoa, easy there, Jeff.  I got to tell you.  Hey, Norton.  Bob Kelly was on the other day.  I couldn't tell the difference between him and you.  Get a new shtick, buddy.  You stole it from him.  You're a one-trick pony.  Yeah, your mother's a one-trick pony, too.  When I give her money, she shines my shoes and heeds my words.  You flipping fern with an opinion.  Your mother's a tried-and-true pony. 
[01:04:30]  She sings punk rock while bad 70s music plays.  You're an uncunny little troll.  All right, I'm standing up.  I'm standing up in the front.  Whoa, whoa.  Martini's team.  Very good.  Oh, wow.  That's perfect.  That's exactly how they do it in the movies.  That's exactly how they do it in the movies.  Because you have to read.  You have to exactly figure out Jimmy's delivery the original time.  Run through that a few times.  Holy crap, that's funny.  Think of what you'd be looking at on a screen and then think of words that would match up  with what he's saying.  All the bad fake curses and everything.  Bad that don't make sense. 
[01:05:00]  What did I say last one?  Your mother does what with a pony to let the finals...  I forgot.  Fern?  I think there was a fern in there.  Yeah, there's a fern reference.  Fern.  Wait, I can play the last...  Yeah.  You know these Denons, right?  You can play the last five seconds of the track?  No?  It's your still records.  Every time you...  You flipping fern with an opinion.  Your mother's a tried-and-true pony.  She sings punk rock while bad 70s music plays.  You're an unfunny little troll.  That is really good. 
[01:05:30]  Sings punk rock.  That's really good.  If I had any real sense of humor, that's what I would have said to begin with.  Yeah.  That would have shown him.  All right, let's...  Here's the original line.  There's more to this bit.  Yeah, an unfunny little troll, buddy.  That's the best you have?  Unfunny little troll?  I say your mother sucks pony dick on film, and you call me a troll?  Do I trip-trap under a bridge?  Drop dead, motherfucker.  All right.  Let's see how Steve cleaned this up for a local broadcast. 
[01:06:00]  We have to do this with a news anchor here?  I'm a little embarrassed and ashamed of my potty mouth.  You're an unfunny little troll, buddy.  That's the best you have?  Unfunny little troll?  I say your mother strips furniture on film, and you call me a troll?  Do I trip-trap under a bridge?  Drop dead, Mr. Falcon.  Hey.  Hey, he stole that from Die Hard 2.  That's great. 
[01:06:30]  Steve, you've got to do another one.  We will.  You've hit a home run here.  Let's say hi to Vic in Connecticut.  Vic?  Vic?  Hey, Vic.  What's happening?  Hey.  I don't usually call shows, but that was awesome.  Unbelievable.  I'm cracking up, and Mr. Falcon, unbelievable.  All right, thanks.  Martini Steve's best bit ever from Philly.  Look at this.  They're loving it.  That was a good one, man.  Well, there's still a little more here before we end the show.  I'm not a professional.  You're a professional.  You're not a professional. 
[01:07:00]  You're a fucking nobody.  You're an anonymous zero.  All right.  And now cleaned up for local broadcast.  I'm not a professional.  You're a professional.  You're not a professional.  You're a faking nobody.  You're an anonymous zero.  Faking.  That really does.  You've definitely hit on what they do on television.  Here's the original dialogue.  I may suck, but your mother swallows and takes it on the face.  Hey, my mother may take it on the face, but at least she's funnier than you, motherfucker. 
[01:07:30]  She's not funnier than me.  The only thing funnier about her is she's a woman with a cock.  That's what's funny about your mother.  And she dangles it over your father's face like a Roman war helmet.  How the hell are you going to clean up this one?  Oh, my goodness.  This was the most challenging bit we had.  Yes.  Nathaniel and I both did VO parts in this one.  I may stink, but your mother swats flies and shaves her face.  My mother might shave her face, but at least she's funnier than you, Mike Foxtrot.  She's not funnier than me.  The only thing funnier about her is she's a woman with a beard.  That's what's funny about your mother. 
[01:08:00]  And she dangles it over your father's face like a rug from Persia.  I like Nathaniel.  I had to play the part of the angry caller.  Anyone else pick up another?  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  We're running out of show.  We want to get to the end of this.  The original dialogue.  You're the worst, man.  I may be the worst, but I'm well paid and you're a listener.  So sit there, boy, and listen.  Put on your headphones and listen, little fella. 
[01:08:30]  I drain the funny out of a room the way your mother drains semen out of black cocks.  Where'd he go?  Oh, I don't think he could take it.  By the way, the CNBC anchor left, I don't know, a half hour ago at least.  At least.  All right.  Here's that same dialogue cleaned up for TV.  You're the worst, man.  I may be the worst, but I'm well paid and you're a listener.  So sit there, boy, and listen.  Put on your headphones and listen, little fella. 
[01:09:00]  I drain the funny out of a room the way your mother drinks seltzer on the rocks.  Where'd he go?  I don't think he could take it.  Excellent.  Wow.  I do like it.  Unbelievable, Steve.  Thank you, Nathaniel, as well.  This was a group effort.  You're listening to O.P. Anthony's Best Bits ever.  You heard this much, but there's a lot more.

One of my favorite bits.  It's audio from an old movie from the 50s 
[01:11:30]  where they talk about how porn is destroying the youth of America.  The guys have some fun with it.  Check it out.  Anthony, we got the perversion in print.  Oh!  Perversion in print.  Yeah, this was one of these 50s, I guess late 50s movies  on how perversion and pornography is destroying the youth of America.  You watch this thing and it's, I swear to you, 
[01:12:00]  it could be some conservative asswipe talking today.  They talk about how, you know, pornography is everywhere.  Not like the old days.  It's everywhere now.  And the means that people can get it.  It's so readily available to the youth of America.  And this is the 50s.  And these people are still babbling the same crap today.  Same crap.  I was watching this with you at like 5 in the morning.  Yeah.  And they said that pornography is being distributed through rapid transit.  Rapid transit. 
[01:12:30]  Well, this was his whole pitch on how pornography is getting everywhere in the country.  And it's more prevalent now than ever, now being the wonderful 50s,  because of the mass distribution that is now allowed because of technology.  Like rapid transit and high-speed printing presses.  Printing presses.  Do they have that line in there?  And they show pictures of airplanes and trains, you know, scurrying along,  bringing pornography to every corner of this country. 
[01:13:00]  They're rushing pornography from New York to San Francisco.  Right.  Well, probably from San Francisco to New York.  Fag capital, San Francisco.  Bringing their gay homosexual pornography to every corner of the country.  Oh, this is about gay pornography?  That's about all kinds of porno.  Just any kind of porno.  Girly magazines.  He actually calls them girly magazines.  And worst of all, the pocketbooks, where he read a line out of it,  where people get their kicks from rape and murder. 
[01:13:30]  Let's listen to the first clip.  Obscene literature is a $2 billion a year business.  Two billion.  That's $2 billion.  Through this material, today's youth can be stimulated to sexual activity  for which he has no legitimate outlet.  He is even enticed to enter the world of homosexuals, lesbians, sadists,  masochists, and other sex deviants. 
[01:14:00]  Jimmy.  The psychiatric terms for these unnatural sex acts  are unknown to most decent adults in our country.  But through this salacious material,  these abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Stupid minds.  Perversion for profit.  Perversion for profit.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I hear these being in every single show sweeper we ever do. 
[01:14:30]  Just end everything he says with,  Opie and Anthony.  Perversion for profit.  Perversion for profit.  Wow, this guy's dead serious.  Oh, this guy could not be more serious.  He's standing in this very 50s office setting  with a map of the United States behind him  with pins in it for some reason.  You know, I guess where all the pornography is.  And he's just angry at all this.  Sorry, they're showing the forecast,  and for Friday it says very nippy. 
[01:15:00]  Nippy.  Why do the weather forecasters have to use such pornographic words  like nippy or penis-y out?  Why?  What does it mean here in Colorado  when it's going to be snatch-like?  I can't believe they just had that for Friday, though.  Nippy.  Nippy.  A little nippy.  B-M-E.  B-M.  Let's go to another clip here.  They constantly portray abnormal sexual behavior 
[01:15:30]  as being normal.  They glorify unnatural sex acts.  They tell youngsters that it's smart.  It's thrilling.  It provides kicks to be a homosexual.  I see it.  And every other kind of beanie.  It provides kicks to be a homosexual.  I don't know if that's quite a kick.  Yeah.  Ow!  I'm not getting kicks!  Oh, you're kicking the whole time. 
[01:16:00]  Kicking.  Screaming.  Whatever else.  Sure, it's a thrill a minute.  It's a kick to be a bottom.  When a big hog goes where you make a B-M,  it's kicks you'll be doing on the bed.  Screaming.  Get off of me, you big burly bear with a sweet face.  Oh, okay.  Sure.  That's fantastic. 
[01:16:30]  What's this clip about communists?  What do communists have to do with pornography?  Because it was the beautiful, wonderful 50s.  Everything tied into communism.  Even gays.  Hold on, sorry.  Even gays, pornography, everything tied into the communists.  The Military Chaplains Association of the United States.  Sounds like a fun group.  Practically every major fraternal, civic, and religious organization.  The juvenile court judges.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Innumerable psychiatrists, sociologists, and psychologists. 
[01:17:00]  Attribute some moral decay among our people.  In very large part to the obscene and pornographic literature so prevalent in our society.  This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  Wow.  See, we're looking at porno.  Yeah.  And you turn your back on the commies who just march in while you're spanking it to some big-titted girly magazine. 
[01:17:30]  Sure.  What an idiot.  He doesn't think the communists are spanking it, too?  While you have your hands wrapped around your Johnson, the commies are marching in, hands wrapped around a rifle.  To steal your sweetheart.  Well, they actually thought that Grandma was a communist when she got a period because her dress was red.  Better dead than red, Granny.  She's wearing communist panties in the outhouse. 
[01:18:00]  Hey, I thought you wanted an apple.  Yeah, I do want an apple.  Where's Ricky?  You're throwing batches.  The communists are throwing hand grenades.  They'll be celebrating their holidays on the White House lawn while you're cleaning up with a tissue.  Ricky.  It's an apple, bro.  Can you just get him an apple?  Please, buddy.  And that's it for today. 
[01:18:30]  We're really sorry about that.  All right.  There goes Ricky, our intern.  He's getting an apple.  Jimmy and Apple.  Can't wait to see it lobbed against the wall.  Let's see.  On the floor.  Teen murders?  On the floor.  Teen murders?  Yeah, this sounds pretty serious.  A five-year-old?  Something about a five-year-old?  It just says teen murders, five-year-old.  Wow.  This might be about some of the books that he was talking about, the pocketbooks that are spewing this filth.  Not only pornographic, but violence and rape and other things like that.  Okay.  A young boy in Philadelphia raped and killed a five-year-old girl. 
[01:19:00]  And while he was testifying that he had been stimulated to this he and his crime by reading a nudist magazine,  a federal court judge in Washington was granting to that very same publication a second-class mailing permit.  Wow.  Wraithin killed a five-year-old girl.  All they found was her little cowboy hat. 
[01:19:30]  And little fake six-shooters.  And very little boots.  All right, here's the clip you've been talking about, the evil homosexuals.  The homosexuals.  Think then of the consequences to the inexperienced youth who, in purchasing and studying this material,  becomes a pawn for these misfits.  These homosexuals who have a slogan that betrays the evil of the breed. 
[01:20:00]  Slogan?  Today's conquest, they say, is tomorrow's competition.  I thought it was going to be Jersey Governor.  The tender age at which homosexuals prefer their conquests.  Look here at the young face and bright smile, which could be the hope of the world.  Noah.  But in the other half of the picture is revealed the seduction of the innocent. 
[01:20:30]  Look at this poor young lad.  But when looking, think of the others who might follow his perfidious footsteps.  When photos like these are available at the corner news rack.  What is the homosexual slogan?  Tastes like shit, I'll have two.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Homosexuals.  Sexuels.  The homosexual preying on this lovely young lad. 
[01:21:00]  calling him a young lad  look at him in his sailor suit  crying as he spins in a circle  in a brown paper bag  in a stall at Port Authority  look at this lovely young lad  who came to work  he's wearing a corduroy blazer  and his shirt buttoned down to his chest  and look at the homosexuals  enjoying it  some of them pay $20  to have him wear a pink tube top 
[01:21:30]  that awful  Freddy in Philly wondering if that guy  was looking at eatabullet.com  he's looking at that lovely young lad  very nice  very good  Hi, you're listening to Opie and Anthony's  best bits  this one's where Steve's car  which is a hybrid broke down  and Opie, Anthony and Jim 
[01:22:00]  all took turns making fun of him for it  his car sounds like it's from the Jetsons  eat shit  that was terrible  Steve's gay  alright, we have another song parody  that came in overnight  in honor of Steve and his hybrid car  Steve should come in and talk about something  let's get Martini Steve in the studio  studio here  little problem, I think  here comes Steve  that's what we had  where is he?  Steve, what's the problem? 
[01:22:30]  well, you know  hybrids are very efficient  but the one way they do perform  just like regular cars  is when you leave the dome light on  all night  it does kill the regular battery  the dome light on for what?  three seconds?  wait, that's all it took? 
[01:23:00]  what, leaving  to shut down your hybrid?  leaving the interior lights on all night  yeah, killed the  it didn't shut off the hybrid engine  so once I got it jumped  it worked just fine  but the regular electronics  like all the windows and stuff like that  operate off the same battery  that a regular car would operate off of  and your starter?  yeah, everything  so leaving all the lights on  would kill the battery  just like it would in any other car  but why would it kill  did it kill the electric motor  that drives your car?  no, not at all  so theoretically  you could have backed out 
[01:23:30]  under electric power?  once I got it jumped  the thing worked fine  I'm not talking about  to get it jumped  that's right  I mean  could you have backed it out  under your  electric motor power?  well no  because I couldn't start it  but isn't it just a switch?  because it's  the electric switch  that powers  the switch that turns on  the car  the actual switch  that turns on  that 300 volt electric motor  is powered  by a normal 
[01:24:00]  regular die hard  so even though  there's enough power  to run the electric motor  you can't start it  to run it on the electric motor  that I learned last night  or yesterday morning  yeah exactly  because you should be able  to run it on  just the electric motor  that's exactly what I thought  and once you actually  get the thing  once you actually  power up the starter  and get it going  yeah everything's fine  and it starts pumping  the power back  into the regular  auxiliary battery  shouldn't there be  a backup  that perhaps  the batteries  that power  your electric motor  that were fine 
[01:24:30]  you say  can then be used  to maybe jump start  your car?  I think there actually is  but I wasn't  I'm not well versed  enough  try it again  ah the old  faggot mobile  is not starting  not a faggot mobile  I am paying  a lot less  for gasoline  you gotta jump  on a cock  and ride that  to work  did you jerk off  in the gas tank  with that said  there's a good  segue into  chemistry's song  about Steve's  hybrid car  oh lovely song 
[01:25:00]  good old chemistry  yeah I'm sure  you're pissed off  by this one  he's good  so I can't really  get pissed off at him  but you know  it doesn't really  he's pretty much  calling you a faggot  yes he is  in this song  we're pretty much  laughing and agreeing  yeah  here's chemistry's  hybrid song  for Steve  I know a big bear  he talks with good diction  hibernates in Toyota  with good fuel emissions  and great tax deductions  his habitats are hybrid 
[01:25:30]  his paws are on the steering wheel  he barely fits inside it  his cave has XM  and a keyless entry  don't leave a scent  in your tent  his belly is empty  the only bear  I know a gastric bypass  smarter than the average  roll up in the hybrid  and steal your picnic basket  the ranger's lunch  always makes his belly groan  the last I seen him  he was speeding round  jelly stone  getting 40 miles per gallon  rolling through the rockies  doing Ramon promos  for two dish jockeys  sees a piece of garbage  forged for nuts and berries  top of the food chain  but drives a car for ferries 
[01:26:00]  piece of shit  stores energy  with friction  and magnets  Ramones  hybrids are for faggots  hybrids are gay  Steve's the queer  plug in your automobile  you take it in the rear  you homo  yo his car got a kickstand  go and buy a new one  spend more than 6 grand  hybrids are gay  Steve's the queer  if you plug in your automobile  you take it in the rear  you homo  his car got a kickstand  go and buy a new one  spend more than 6 grand  Hybrid song, dear 
[01:26:30]  Hybrid song, dear  Come on, Steve, come on, yeah  All right, well  Piece of crap  I'm going to go work on my new song  Chemistry Got Killed With A Clawhammer  So how'd you get into work?  They gave me a rental until they can  Ooh  Yeah, I mean, it's not  It's under full warranty  And they go, yeah, okay  We're just going to replace the battery  They gave you a rental 
[01:27:00]  Was it a hybrid rental?  No, it's not  Because they can't keep those  In the showroom long enough to  Oh, they're flying off the shelves  They certainly are  You know what, call me a homo if you want  But, you know  All right  Homos  But there's a year-long waiting list  For these cars, so  You know what else is a waiting list for?  AZT  Well, when they only make a  Well, when they only make a hundred a year  Yeah, they need so  Exactly  That's why there's a waiting list, you idiot 
[01:27:30]  How many are on the assembly line?  Plenty of them  Oh, stop it  Did you  Wait, when we were in Los Angeles  Didn't you see all the hybrid cars that were out there?  No  No, I did  I was too busy whizzing past them  In some scooped-up rocket car that I rented  What happened to your car?  Did the power surge protector fail?  Plug-in vehicle makes me sick  It's not a plug-in vehicle  It certainly is  Hybrid taxis are coming to New York  Exactly  Big story in the paper today  Apparently there's a surplus of faggot cab drivers 
[01:28:00]  Yep  Yeah, these taxi cab drivers have the option to convert from gas-guzzling Ford Crown Victorias  To any of six car models that run on both gas and electricity  Great  That's my friend  Hybrid cabs coming to New York, it looks like  Great  Steve was driving to work and almost got rear-ended  Because he pushed in the cigarette lighter by accident  And his speed went down like 20 miles per hour  Doesn't do that  No  It doesn't  I kind of like that it went in  Yeah  I like that  I kind of like this 
[01:28:30]  It's a good format, but my presentation really stunk  You knew that one was finished  Yeah  Because when you said he pushed his cigarette lighter in  And then you kept on trucking  And then it tends to slow the car down 20 miles  I had to pick a speed  And it really stunk  My presentation blew  It was just a little mixed up  Good idea  Because I could picture Steve  I like the idea  Driving  And then the cigarette lighter  And then he slows down because of the battery  You know  Just the idea of Steve being rear-ended is funny in itself  That's true 
[01:29:00]  Alright Steve  I'm so mean  No, I love you Steve  Why don't you take off there Steve  Alright  I pushed that piece of shit out of here  Opie and Anthony's Best Bits  Best Drew Boogie Remix  There it is

[01:32:30]  Hey, you're listening to Opie and Anthony's Best Bits, 
[01:33:00]  and this is a real good one, too, just like the last one.  This is when Regis sings.  We listen to some of Regis' singing, we make fun of it,  and Krista the Blind Girl calls in and...  It gets out of hand.  Well, yeah, before you know it, one of the most classic lines comes out of Jimmy's mouth.  Made a promo.  Yeah.  O&A's Best Bits. 
[01:33:30]  Wake up, wake up, wake up, it's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, and we will never leave.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, make a move.  Yeah, the Opie and Anthony show, the O&A virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out, and thanks for helping us out with the whole virus thing. 
[01:34:00]  What's wrong, Jim Norton?  I'm just, as we're coming back from break, watching this, what is this show at Regis?  Good Morning America?  Regis and Kelly.  I don't even know what it's called.  No, because you're never up this early.  Until recently, but...  I just don't...  It's amazing to me the forced cuteness that people buy into.  Dude, she's hot.  I'm not saying...  Dude, please.  She's a dirty girl, too, by the way.  I would torture her for hours.  She takes the drill, though?  She's a very dirty girl, yes.  How do you know?  You could just tell.  And she was on our show before she got really famous, 
[01:34:30]  and you could just tell by talking to her that she's a dirty girl.  She's had how many kids, though?  You don't know what kind of wreckage is down there.  Nah, man.  Some of the girls could keep it together after they have the kids.  You know something?  That really is a turn-off.  Eh.  What am I going to say?  I know Ope's into that.  You like the pregnant chicks.  Do you really?  He had a pregnant chick come into the studio once.  He'd get naked and do a retarded dance in front of him.  Big areolas with milk leaking out of them?  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  It's called a lap dance.  Yeah, it's one of my weird fetishes.  I have a few weird ones, too, but not pretty.  I like just me and her to be involved.  I don't need a little rug rat in there in the belly.  In there, grabbing at your junk as it thrusts into his head,  into the soft spot.  Fire some into the soft spot.  You pull it out, your mule smells like saline because there's placenta on it.  That's great.  I'm going to give the little fetus the Kennedy treatment and blast him in the head.  Jesus.  That's it.  Look at his fat little fetus head back to the left. 
[01:35:30]  The music interlude of the O&A show.  Oh, really?  What is this?  You make me feel so young.  Ah, the Regis CD.  You make me feel so spring-a-sprung.  And every time I see you, yes, you make me feel so young.  But you're happy individual the moment that you speak.  Oh.  I want to go play hide and seek. 
[01:36:00]  In your pussy!  I want to go and bounce the moon.  Wow.  Just like a toy balloon.  Oh.  You and I are just like a couple of tots.  Tots.  Running across the meadow.  Picking up lots of forget-me-nots.  Oh.  You make me feel so young. 
[01:36:30]  You make me feel so young.  You make me feel there are songs to be sung.  Like when I was hung.  A wonderful thing to be flung.  And even when I'm old and gray.  Like now?  That is some awful music, man.  It's wonderful when a celebrity puts out a music CD.  I love these things.  You know what that's called?  That's called when you get to a point in the business  where nobody around you is comfortable enough to go, 
[01:37:00]  Dude, that stinks.  That's awfulness.  People, you think anybody he knows likes that?  You think anyone's going,  Boy, that was terrific.  Not someone he knows,  but I know someone that likes it  and probably plays it on his show.  Who?  Don't you think that's being played on Frank's Place?  Oh, probably.  I bet.  Here's the latest one from Regis.  It's the song that's gotta be.  Oh.  Picking up forget-me-nots.  Forget-me-nots.  No, I can't.  Like a toy balloon. 
[01:37:30]  Just stay away from the coon.  Running around like a couple of tots.  Like tots.  I kinda...  I wanna F your ass till it rots.  Come here, Gelman.  I'm, uh...

Anyone  Have you done that? 
[02:19:30]  Um  You're not supposed to do stuff like that  Right  It's evil, nasty, and filthy  As far as the Catholic Church goes  Well  Self  I don't know  Some kind of like selfishness or something  I don't know  That's what I was taught  Selfishness  Who taught you that?  That's not a bad idea  Eric's got a pretty good idea  The nuns at the foundling  Ooh  Yeah  What do you want me to do?  What a trooper 
[02:20:00]  Isn't she a trooper, folks?  We're just  We're mulling this over  Yeah  We're just trying to think of something  Is anything good on the instant feedback?  We're thinking maybe something to do with Pat's  Toe  Toe  Oh, no  I don't want to put somebody's ilky toe in my mouth  Yuck  Mouth?  Who said anything about a mouth, Patty?  I'm just guessing  Yeah  Let's see  We have instant feedbacks coming in like crazy 
[02:20:30]  I'm a germaphobe  Two words  Drill dough  What do we got?  A lot of people saying  Wiffle bat  No  No  How about not in the front do Wiffle bat?  No  No  No  No  We could maybe  We could go old school  And hide the 200 in the front of someone's pants  And then line everyone up  Who's going to do that?  I would  Jimmy's in  Anybody else?  No  Danny's in 
[02:21:00]  Wait  Explain to everybody  Basically  She'd have like five guys lined up  And she has to keep  You know  Reaching into pants  Until she gets it  And searching inside  Yeah  Until you find the $200  Yeah  Oh  Like another Ron Jeremy  Right  She kind of did that though  Yeah  I don't think he would remember me though  Oh yeah he would  Oh he wouldn't  He would  Yeah he would  I don't mind  Let's see  Anybody? 
[02:21:30]  Bueller?  Anyone?  Anyone?  I'm thinking  I'm thinking the glove  The KY  And making a couple of fingers disappear  No  No  All right that's the deal  That's the bet  All right  I don't want anyone to touch me  No it wouldn't be anyone  It would be you  You would put the gloves on  You would then rub KY on your fingers  And then you have to make one finger per $100 bill 
[02:22:00]  Why?  So if you get both fingers in there  It's $200  And we're talking up to the middle knuckle  Up to the middle knuckle  That's not bad  Oh my god  And then tickle your own G spot  Why does she have to put gloves on?  It's her  Well I don't know  To make it clinical  Yeah  It's not as sexy  Or Patty  We can play cherry darts  Very literally actually

[02:44:00]  Uh-huh.  Dude, this is one of the gayest stories I'll ever tell in the air, okay?  It's already gearing up to be gay.  You're in second gay gear.  It's beyond gay, I'm going to admit it.  I'm not gay.  Of course.  But it's going to be hard to defend the story, okay?  I hope this doesn't go, by the way, where I sense it might be going.  What?  I just don't like this.  Yeah, we'll send.  I'm having a feeling, too.  Oh, it's awful.  It's awful.  I'm definitely throwing myself in the barrel here. 
[02:44:30]  I meant to tell this story a long time ago.  So, you know, Jay was visiting, whatever, and it was the Survivor finale, and it was a cold, rainy night.  Ooh.  And we decide, you know, to get some takeout, some cheese and crackers.  Oh, wait a minute.  Crack open a bottle of wine.  I'm telling you.  Oh, God.  I'm telling you, it's gay crap.  You can stop right there.  All right.  And it's already.  All right, I guess I will.  Really gay.  Do you want to hear more or not? 
[02:45:00]  Of course.  All right.  We go through the supermarket to get all this stuff.  We're planning just a mellow night, you know, in front of the TV to watch the Survivor finale, okay?  Two men, some wine, an afghan.  Dude, trust me.  Cheese, crackers, no dried sausage, or did you bring that yourselves?  It's awful.  Shut up.  So we're going up and down the aisles, and I'm like, hey, Jay, I got a fireplace that I've never used, right?  So they got the DuraFlames?  Yeah, very easy.  Not only do they have the DuraFlame logs.  By the way, after I tell the story, I will not be reading my email for two to three days, okay? 
[02:45:30]  All right.  So good luck trying to abuse me, and I'm not reading any message boards, and I'm not even going to answer the phones.  Oh, okay.  So we see the pile of DuraFlame logs, but right next to it are Java logs.  What is a Java log?  Java logs are like DuraFlame logs, but they give the smell of coffee in your apartment when you're burning them.  Are you kidding?  And I love my coffee, so I'm like, hey, let's try the Java log. 
[02:46:00]  Why not get a DuraFlame and make some coffee?  Why is my coffee spilled everywhere?  Are you sure it's not a Java log?  She spilled my Java log.  What the hell is this?  This is not what I ordered.  You bitch.  This is not even close to what I ordered.  Uh-oh.  Kathy Diva.  Look at this thing.  Wow.  It's filled up to the tippity top.  Look at it.  It's spilling all over the console.  Like, I don't know if it's possible, but I think there's just too much liquid in here, and it's now trying to escape. 
[02:46:30]  Did one of the savage deli people that work in this fine city, one of those savage Middle Easterns?  No, it's a Starbucks.  Dude, it doesn't look like Starbucks.  What is this?  I ordered a cappuccino.  Oh, you did?  A 2% cappuccino.  Sorry, I heard the grande skim thing.  What, did they put both in the cup?  No.  The thing is overflowing.  I over-latte-ed it, I guess.  Ah.  We'll go fix that. 
[02:47:00]  I don't know what this is.  It's a coffee.  But thank you for the effort.  I really appreciate it.  No problem.  Maybe he's got other things on his mind.  This is the new friendlier Opie.  Having sex with porn stars or something.  All right.  How's that going?  Still going?  Yeah, we've kind of moved on.  I'm banging other girls.  She's banging hundreds of other guys.  It's in the past.  Maybe next month I'll have an update for you.  All right.  Sorry to hear that.  No, it's all right.  I'm here for the show. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Fair enough.  All right.  The new friendlier Opie.  If someone spills your coffee, I pardon you.  I pardon you.  Anyway, so I go, hey, Jay, let's try these Java logs.  So we bring the Java logs home with the cheese and crackers.  All excited of the coffee smell.  And the Survivor finale is about to begin with, it was the season with, what was his name?  Rupert or whatever the hell his name was.  The guy with the beard?  The gay guy?  The gay guy.  That's like the first season, bro.  Oh, okay.  This is only like last year. 
[02:48:00]  I watched the first season.  That was about it.  All right.  So I start the fire.  We open up the wine.  We got some takeout, some cheese and crackers.  Survivor's about to start.  Fire's starting to crackle.  Smelling the nice smell of Java.  Dude, this is awful.  I'm telling you.  I know it's awful.  But you know Jay.  So it's not, well, whatever.  I'm not even going to try to explain because it does sound awful.  It sounds awful.  I understand.  All right.  So it sounds awful.  Sonny robbing the bank to get Leona's sex change wasn't as gay as this. 
[02:48:30]  I know.  So then, you know, it's an icy, rainy night out.  You know, I'm like, Jay, I'm going to put some sweats on and get comfortable.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, I know.  It just keeps going.  So I don't have sweats.  I have some flannel PJs on.  I'm like, well, no one's going to, this is the key to the story.  And I'm like, ah, no one's going to see me.  It's just Jay.  I've known him forever.  Yeah.  Ant's known him forever.  Look how I'm like, help.  Sure.  I'm just praying that you're going to help me out a little bit here. 
[02:49:00]  But I've always been completely dressed around Jay.  Well, so have I.  I just happen to have flannel PJs on.  All right.  And the wine's flowing and Survivor's on and.  Cheese and crackers.  Cheese and crackers and the job log.  Crackle and job log.  And all of a sudden, Jay's like, hey, is it getting smoky in here or is it my imagination?  I'm like, what?  So I look in the distance and you can kind of see the smoke.  A little haze.  A little haze up high, right?  Uh-oh.  So I'm like, oh, my God.  Was the flume open, closed? 
[02:49:30]  What the F, right?  So I opened it or closed it.  I don't know what I did to hopefully get this smoke out because obviously something's not working right.  Uh-huh.  So whatever I did made it so much worse.  So now the smoke is just pouring out of the fireplace into my apartment.  Now it's getting pretty bad.  It's getting serious.  Uh-oh.  So then I decide, oh, fuck.  So I decided to try to take the door flame log and throw it out my backyard.  And as I'm trying to get it out of the fireplace, the whole thing explodes, making more fire and smoke. 
[02:50:00]  What do you mean?  Like it did a crackle thing?  Yeah, it's all chemical.  So it kind of just fell apart.  And now it's just like, now it's flaming, all right?  Yeah, so is the situation around your apartment.  Dude, wait for the punchline.  So I'm like, Jay, holy crap.  Now we got a problem.  Now the smoke is just flying out of the fireplace, dark and thick and going right up to the ceiling.  I mean, it is bad.  No exaggeration.  And so now I open all the windows, open my back door to my outdoor part there.  I'm just hearing jokes and jokes with every word. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, I know.  I opened my back door.  Big, black, and thick.  Right.  You know, you're saying things that just conjure an image.  If it wasn't so early in L.A., we'd have to get Jay on the phone.  Maybe we'll get him on the phone tomorrow.  So I'm like, Jay, there's a fan downstairs.  Go get it.  So he grabs the fan.  The windows are open.  It's freezing out.  The door's open.  Now we got the fan.  Now we're just blowing all this black, dark smoke out of the apartment, right? 
[02:51:00]  Right.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  What are we going to do?  Now we're just running around trying to figure this out because I can't get the door flame out, right?  So all of a sudden, I'm downstairs.  I forgot.  Trying to find another fan or something.  And all of a sudden, do, do, do, do, do, banging on the door really hard.  Jay's like from upstairs.  He goes, should I get that?  I'm like, yeah, I guess.  I don't know who's stopping by.  I'm like, yeah, grab it, right?  So he opens up the door.  The fire department.  There you go.  But they weren't real firemen. 
[02:51:30]  They were Chippendales dancers.  They threw out their helmets.  Dude.  So the fire department comes barging in in full gear with the oxygen on, the mask, everything.  I mean, everything.  Wow.  Isn't that amazing that the people actually in the apartment weren't the ones they called?  It got that bad?  No, it was really bad.  I'm not kidding.  Obviously, the neighbors ratted me out.  Turns out, you know, I went out the front door, and there were like three or four fire 
[02:52:00]  trucks on my block, closed off the whole street.  They thought there was just a massive fire going on because of the smoke.  Just two guys eating some cheese and crackers.  So there's three or four fire department guys, you know, in full gear that look like they  just walked off one of those stupid calendars they sell every year, you know, just big,  tough, burly guys in their gear.  Buff.  Shut up.  And there I am in my PJs, Anthony. 
[02:52:30]  A couple glasses of wine on the, you know, near the couch.  It looks real bad for you.  It looks horrendous.  Because remember, going back in the story, I said that I didn't think anyone was going  to see me this way.  Of course.  So you do things when you don't think.  You know what I mean?  You're like, yeah, whatever.  Who's really going to see me?  So there's three or four guys in there, and we're looking just really bad and faggy.  And right next to my fireplaces, there's a picture of Kurt Cobain in makeup.  I'm sure that didn't help the situation, right? 
[02:53:00]  So all of a sudden, they're staring at the apartment.  They see it's a door of flame log, right?  And Jay and I, at this point, are trying to look tough, like, it was a door of flame  log, but we got it under control, sir, or whatever, you know?  Yeah.  And they're on their walkie-talkies, like, ah, God, it's just a 202 or whatever they say.  202 is fire in a fag's apartment.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what Jay said, you know?  It's got to be.  Yeah.  Yeah, you boys have fun now.  Yeah, because they're on their walkie-talkies, ah, it's only a 202, you know, sorry, Jesus. 
[02:53:30]  And they're all pissed off, because they were ready to, like, you know, do some serious  firefighting, you know?  Of course.  And they walk out of the apartment, and Jay and I look at each other like, holy S, how  bad does this look, you know?  Did anyone recognize you?  No.  Because do you understand how awful that was being?  And go, dude, I went to Opie's apartment, and he had a little fire incident, and apparently  he's a gay man.  No, no, no, no, no, no, relax on that.  But, yeah, but, you know, they thought they were going to see some really cool shit, and  instead it was like, you know, me and PJs, a little glass of wine on the side there, and 
[02:54:00]  a door of flame fire out of control.  Looks bad.  It was awful.  What did they do?  Anything?  Did they put the log out?  Well, I forgot, at this point, I guess, you know, we got the log on, because I started  like, just smashing the thing until, you know, it kind of, whatever, but, yeah, and  they were so bummed out, and they just walk out of the apartment, and the last guy just  slams the door shut, and I'm like, oh, God, dude, we look like the biggest fags right  now.  Well, I understand the worst part wasn't even the fire, it was at the end of the night, 
[02:54:30]  Jay felt fat.  He's complaining the cheese and crackers go right to his thighs.  Oh, I should just rub these on my midsection.  Chief.  Yeah.  Chief.  Yeah, but the best part was on the walkie-talkie, the, ah, it's just that 202.  We'll be back at the firehouse in about five minutes.  Just a couple of flamers here with a dura flame. 
[02:55:00]  Nothing to worry about.  Just a couple of fags.  We bailed them out.  We'll be back at the firehouse.  Yeah.  Remember how, ah, when we left, we slid down the pole?  Yeah, they're doing the same thing here in this apartment.  Slow tooth.  Or whatever, whatever the code was, but we knew that code was something really awful for  the guys back in the firehouse.  It was one number off from a gerbil incident.  Yeah.  Yukon the trucker, what's up, Yukon? 
[02:55:30]  What's shaking, guys?  What do you got, brother man?  Hey, I want to know when you went to a grocery store if you picked up a bag of marshmallows  and it took the garbage.  Man, trying to recreate the old fraternity scene.  Thank you.  Rich in Brooklyn, what do you have?  O-B-N-J.  Shit dig.  See, you try to share on the show.  There's no sharing here.  Not in this forum.  They're ripped you to pieces.  All right, now we got to get Jay on the phone. 
[02:56:00]  We'll get him on tomorrow.  Are you going to be mad if you call and another man answers?  Shut up.  Hi, Jay?  No, this is Bruce.  Oh, did I dial the right number?  Is Jay there?  Yes, he's right here.  He can't come to the phone.  He's got a mouth full of cheese and crackers.  Hey, thanks for that Java log suggestion.  Yeah, we really enjoy the Java log.  Jay, you want to turn over the Java log?  It's kind of smoking a bit. 
[02:56:30]  We're just sitting, drinking a little wine and watching Survivor.  It's getting a little smoky in here.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What an incident.  Scott in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, maybe you need to get a chimney sweep to come out there and ram a big black pole down  your chimney shoes.  It's going to be a long day.  They say you didn't get it fixed?  No, I haven't used a fireplace since. 
[02:57:00]  The chimney obviously has to be swept out.  Yeah.  But Flea Man from CringeHumor.net, what's up?  Hey, I just want to say that I'm a cashier at a local A&P.  And now on the bag of Duraflame, it says, don't leave unattended when having wine and cheese  with another man in P.J.  A little disclaimer on that thing now, huh?  A Java log.  Did it smell like coffee?  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh, man.  Anthony's best bits.  Best Ramone promo.  Ramone. 
[02:57:30]  Ramone.  Ramone.  This sweeper has aids.  Number four.  I just love a drive in the country laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramone?  Ramone. 
[02:58:00]  Ramone.  Call 911.  Opie and Anthony's best bits.  Best Opie moment.  Hey, look at me.  I'm a dick.  Hey, it's E-Rock, and we're up to Opie's Where's My Milk segment.  Opie's Milk was late arriving to the studio, and the bag that it arrived in set Opie off.  So it's Opie and Anthony's best bits.  I understand I have problems.  Oh, my God.  Trust me.  I know that. 
[02:58:30]  Do you hear yourself?  Dude, what did I say before break?  What did I say?  I understand.  There's something that happens from time to time with me.  Matter of fact, it was a promo.  Yep.  Because, uh, they forgot my potatoes.  Yes, they're potatoes.  It wasn't about the potatoes.  My blood sugar level drops, and I start losing my mind.  I understand.  All up with...  Dude, I just played a seven-minute mash-up song, not for the stupid audience.  I could care less about them.  Half of them went to another channel for a while. 
[02:59:00]  I threw that on so we could take a quick commercial break, and I could get some food in my gullet.  So I don't pass out.  But I am not talking about the situation.  So I wrote a note during the...  While we're discussing the stupid tsunami song that I could give a flying crap about, by the way.  But I figured it would fill up 20 minutes of radio today.  I wrote a note to Steve.  Steve, you know, SOS, I need milk immediately, meaning my blood sugar level is dropping as I speak.  So that was literally five minutes before we went to break, and then I'm noticing there is no milk around. 
[02:59:30]  So I'm like, I'm a professional DJ.  Find what's called filler.  So I'm like, make it believe I care that the Doors Blondie song is cool enough to play on the show.  No, it's because it was the longest thing I could find, which was like six minutes long.  I'm like, hey, man, this is great.  Listen to this crap.  I'm like, thinking that the milk would arrive any second, I would get the cereal in my effing stomach, and then I would be fine for the rest of the show. 
[03:00:00]  I am not talking about the situation at hand.  I am talking about the fact that you sound like a madman.  And I understand.  I'm not saying I'm not.  I'm not saying I'm not with your milk.  His only crime is he was pulling it from a Dwayne Reed bag.  Who the eff gets milk from Dwayne Reed?  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed.  Over your unloads on him, why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk? 
[03:00:30]  Because I need it right away.  There's a deli right downstairs, is there not?  You sound crazy.  Is there a deli right downstairs?  There is absolutely a deli, and I agree.  They should have gotten the milk from the deli.  We have a bunch of retards that should be strapping bombs on them and walking around in Iraq.  Then working for us.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing how desperate I am right now?  How come when I walked in, I walked into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  I don't know.  I know.  He yells at me, where's my milk? 
[03:01:00]  I have a line on the milk getting.  You don't understand.  My meters are dropping fast.  It's called I go into a panic.  It's not that I'm a diva or anything like that.  I treat these guys very nice unless I get into one of these situations.  Eric, why wasn't the milk gotten from the deli that is right downstairs from this very building?  Okay, one, I didn't send him, so I don't know where he went.  Two, apparently I've been told they don't sell milk downstairs at that deli.  They don't sell milk downstairs, Danny? 
[03:01:30]  They don't have sealed milk downstairs at the deli.  I don't care if it's sealed.  They'll put it in like a coffee cup, but that's fine.  See, now, how is anyone to know?  You wouldn't come up with that and go, what is it?  I don't know what that animal's doing.  It's open.  It's open.  It's an open container, Tina.  Hold on.  No, that's where I'm different than Jimmy.  I don't really care about that, especially under this situation.  I just need to get food in me.  I don't care.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care. 
[03:02:00]  I just need milk.  You know what we need?  Emergency Parmalat milk.  You put it in a cabinet somewhere, and it lasts forever.  It sits there, and then when you open it up, then it's got to be refrigerated.  But it's like, in case of emergency, break glass, and you have your milk right there.  We have that.  I said that when I came in.  Stop it.  I said, we have whole milk Parmalat.  That's all we have.  And he looked at me and did nothing.  Because I didn't know what that was.  No one does.  You've got regular milk.  No, I really didn't know what that was.  No, no, it's regular milk.  It's just been processed in a way that it's good until you open. 
[03:02:30]  And it's like, here's the other problem.  There is milk in the refrigerator, but you don't know if it went sour or anything.  That's Parmalat right there.  I really don't know what that is.  It's milk.  It's real milk.  There's nothing different about it.  It's just the way it's processed.  It can last sealed.  It can last for a long time.  Can I explain something to Dean in the Bronx?  I know I'm whining.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  I understand.  Anthony brought it up during commercials going, dude, you sound like a raving ranger.  I had to look right at Opie and go, you sound like a madman.  You're trying to wake me up out of this weird coma state I get into. 
[03:03:00]  It has nothing to do with being like, you know, Patrice from Brazil is saying, come on.  Come on.  I feel the whole blood sugar level thing dropping in my body drastically, okay?  We still have a radio show to do.  And then I'm looking at the clock and all the meters, you know, counting down, thinking,  I don't have enough time to eat before we get back on the air.  And then they walk in with the milk in a Dwayne Reed bag.  I'm like, I know where Dwayne Reed is. 
[03:03:30]  It's not close to here.  No.  So who went and got it?  Ricky.  Oh.  Of course it was Ricky.  He stinks.  If Opie wants milk, he only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid.  No Dwayne Reed.  Never Dwayne Reed.  Jesus.  That is an odd place to get milk.  Mike from Jersey.  My goodness.  Look, I'm calming down already.  Mike.  Where did you buy your cold medicine?  Dairy barn?  Long Island joke.  Mikey.  Opie, you sound like Doc from Back to the Future right now. 
[03:04:00]  It's like you're asking for 10,000 gigawatts.  That's a stretch.  Yeah.  All right.  There he is.  Now we'll listen to Opie eat because he had to go to Dwayne Reed for the milk.  I thought, stupid me, by the time the mashup was done, I would have had the...  You'd have been done.  You'd have been on seconds already.  And no one would have cared and, you know, the show would have just moved on.  You'd have been on your seconds.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony's Best Bits Ever.  You heard this much, but there's a lot more. 
[03:04:30]  So maybe you're hungry and you want to have a sandwich.  That's all right.  But you just need to make it very, very quick so you can come back and listen to the Opie  and Anthony's Best Bits Ever.  XM Satellite Radio presents Left Jab with Mark Walsh and David Goodfriend.

Man, you haven't lived until you've heard the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  He says some crazy stuff.  I believe he's leaving a message for a co-worker.  Is that the back story?  Yeah? 
[03:07:00]  Or a chick at a party.  Yeah, or a chick at a party.  And he wants to engage in lurid acts with her and his partner wife, Betsy.  Girlfriend.  Girlfriend Betsy.  And the listeners send in a bunch of remixes using that audio.  And it's a lot of fun.  And we giggle.  We cannot get enough of the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  He totally loses it at the end of that.  Yeah.  Like, he loses it.  He was kind of doing a good job with, I want to do this to you and that.  And then at the end, it's just like, yeah, you come up, hookers. 
[03:07:30]  And then he's just throwing words out.  Hookers.  Fuck.  You.  Drugs.  Coke.  Coke.  Fuck.  You know what happens?  Ass.  Eat.  Fuck.  You know what happened?  I've been studying these tapes since we started playing them.  Studying?  Yeah.  I'm studying this whole thing.  Studying this tape.  It just amazes me.  He just ran out of things he wanted to do with her.  I know.  That's what the problem was.  Well, you know, there is only so much you can do.  Right.  Unless you're Jimmy.  That'd be interesting.  I should have shit on my chest.  Piss in my mouth.  New things can be added in.  This guy, what a rookie. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, my God.  That's all right.  Fuck.  Suck.  That's pretty much it.  Mm-hmm.  You know, what are you going to do?  I want to tickle behind your kneecap.  Yeah, that's good.  Well, then her and Betsy make out, so he does kind of like go back the other way.  Yeah.  Yeah, he kind of, he tried, but, yeah.  I don't think he pulled it off.  He tried to bring the romance back just a little bit.  The romance.  After saying how he wanted to jerk off in her face, then he brings it back a little bit.  I want you to have a miscarriage and then spoon with Betsy. 
[03:08:30]  Betsy.  Poor Betsy.  You know, we've been doing a lot of interviews and they're, well, what's the difference between  regular radio and satellite radio?  Yeah.  Answer, the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  That pretty much sums it up.  Because no one is having fun like we are with these things.  No one.  And now the listeners and our interns, they're all starting to make their own versions of  the sex tapes.  Remember we encouraged that yesterday, Anthony?  Only on this show do you have the forum to, at home, at your own recording equipment, 
[03:09:00]  take some of these clips, throw them together, send them to us, and we actually play it.  Yeah.  There you go.  Only on this program.  Here's the problem.  We go on vacation after tomorrow.  Yep.  So if you want in on this quick little bit that we've been doing the last few days, you  got to start hustling and get it into us, okay?  Last show before vacation tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  And I think the audio, the sex tapes audio for now is up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  Right.  But Danny, our own intern, came up with this. 
[03:09:30]  Listen to this one.  Trade message Sunday, 9.04 p.m.  You're so fucking hot.  I am a big cock.  I want you to suck it.  I told Betsy, Betsy's so jealous.  If you agree with this, when I see you walk by me in the hallway, don't punch me in the  face.  I want to get Betsy and then just pick up Jane Mansfield's head and eat it.  If you're into this, just breathe while you're in the office.  I just want to put white powder in an envelope and dump it in your face and fuck you all.  Betsy needs a hooker's ass.  If you want to suck my cock, just look at me stupidly and kind of half smile. 
[03:10:00]  That was a Shibo reference, I remember.  Gene Mansfield's head and eat it.  Bravo, Danny.  Bravo.  That is sexy.  All right.  Anthony, then the listener started sending in there, Pat O'Brien, sex tape, remixes.  I want to play one from Joe that came in late last night. 
[03:10:30]  Is it sexy?  Yeah, it's very sexy.  Sexy.  He definitely sexed his version up here.  Listen to this.  This guy cannot control himself.  He's got to call this woman and kill her.  Let's get crazy.  Give us a call.  God, you're so fucking hot.  I'm so fucking in here.  It's incredible.  I'll make you come.  Girl, you make me feel real good.  I'm so fucking in here. 
[03:11:00]  We can do it till we won't wake up.  But I want to fucking make you crazy.  Girl, you know I'm hooked on you.  You're so fucking hot.  This is what I'll do.  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you.  I want to sex you up.  And suck your tits.  I want to make me feel real good.  I want to make me feel real good.  I want to sex you up.  I fucking want to fucking make you crazy. 
[03:11:30]  The worst part is I need to fucking a girl named Betsy.  I want her to knit a flag and then eat your cunt.  God damn.  That is great.  How embarrassing.  Embarrassing.  Joe, good job.  We could just talk about this all day.  I love the Pat O'Brien tapes. 
[03:12:00]  We're giddy as is because vacation's right around the corner.  We could just do this thing all day long.  Pat O'Brien.  Yeah.  The other news stations, the news station's been hitting on it, but they can't play it.  No.  That's the beauty of the satellite.  Yeah.  You can just play this and it doesn't matter.  People love it.  It takes away when you got a bleep.  Imagine how many times we'd have to bleep that.  It would be off to listen to it just bleeped. 
[03:12:30]  Well, Anthony, the story gets better.  Oh, no.  It can't possibly.  The story gets better.  Give the recap.  Well, Pat O'Brien was leaving these messages on this girl's machine.  Sexually explicit.  You heard him here.  And then it got a little worse.  We reported that there's a photograph.  Yeah.  The girl, I guess Betsy, has this ex-husband who has possession of a photo of Pat O'Brien jacking. 
[03:13:00]  Just a picture of a glistening, sweaty Pat O'Brien with dick in hand getting down to business.  And that picture's probably going to be making the round soon in the tabloids somewhere on the Internet.  Yeah.  But you're saying now it gets a little worse?  Well, yes.  According to the Daily News, the gossip column called Gate Crasher.  This guy, Ben. 
[03:13:30]  The guy who writes Gate Crasher.  Ben does the gossip column?  Yeah, Ben Whittacombe.  Access Hollywood battle on.  We should probably leave poor old Pat O'Brien alone, but the stories keep coming.  A source tells us he used to refer to a gay African-American senior producer at Access Hollywood as the fruit monkey.  Oh, Jesus.  And he would say this to her face. 
[03:14:00]  Are you kidding me?  Or to his face.  Excuse me.  His face.  His face.  He would say this to his face.  A source tells us he used to refer to a gay African-American senior producer at Access Hollywood as the fruit monkey.  Oh.  This guy just lost his mind.  He was probably just doing coke and drinking during...  You, Betsy, me, and the fucking fruit monkey.  Get him in here.  I want to fuck the fruit monkey in the ass.  You eat Betsy. 
[03:14:30]  I want the fruit monkey to climb a tree and pound a banana into my anus.  It always knows.  It always knows.  That's the latest today.  The fruit monkey.  Oh, I'm sure now all allegations are going to be coming out about him.  A lot of former staffers probably going to start coming out and saying, yeah, this guy's a far rank.  There's also, in the same thing, they talk about how he was hitting on Oprah Winfrey as well. 
[03:15:00]  Ugh.  He does deserve to be in rehab.  I guess he was at...  How drunk do you have to be to try to hit on that?  I guess he was at the Four Seasons in L.A., saw Oprah Winfrey at the bar.  Oprah Winfrey walks into a bar.  I fucked her.  Me and Betsy and the fruit monkey.  I guess he went up to Oprah Winfrey.  She's the fat monkey, I call her.  Went up to Oprah Winfrey in the bar and was starting to flirt with her and try to pick her up. 
[03:15:30]  Right.  And she didn't go for it.  Yeah, obviously.  So I hope all the stories get out before we go on vacation.  Oh, please.  We're going to be reading about that on vacation going, damn it.  Really?  Why aren't we on the air?  We're going to have to call up.  Me and you will call the studio and do a little break from our vacations.  It's like, turn on the station.  Turn it on.  We've got to talk about this.  Turn on the channel.  We need to talk about this now.  All right.  Then, while we were on a train back from Washington yesterday, Anthony, our own Derek came 
[03:16:00]  up with a little remix.  Ooh.  Took the Pat O'Brien sex tapes and came up with this.  Saved message Sunday, 7.09 p.m.  Hey, it's me.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  And why I'm like this.  But I want to fucking...  I don't want to fucking go crazy.  I don't want to fucking go crazy.  I don't want to fucking end you.  You're so fucking hot.  I want to lift your pussy. 
[03:16:30]  I want to make you come.  You suck your tips.  I want to fucking make you fucking crazy.  Look at me and say yes.  Say yes.  Oh, wait.  I don't want you badly.  I know you want me.  Let's just fucking have fun. 
[03:17:00]  If you get this message, just go to the bathroom and we can't push down.  Bye.  I want to suck your pussy.  Fuck dirty too.  Lead off your face.  I'm a fire on the tree. 
[03:17:30]  You're so fucking hot.  You're fucking hot.  I want to fuck you.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  Go crazy.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  Hey.  You have no more messages.  Hey, fruit monkey.  I want to fuck you in the ass while you bang cymbals together and smile.  If you want to do this with me, 
[03:18:00]  can you just swing from your tail and throw shit at my face?  I want you and four friends to drag me out of my semi-rig and beat me with a sink in the middle of the street.  I want to walk up to you in a train and shoot you a few times.  Motherfucker.  Motherfucker. 
[03:18:30]  God damn.  Let's just get nuts.  Let's just get crazy.  If I ask for five bucks, I'll paralyze you.  It just gets better and better.  Oh, God.  What a creep.  There is no other word.  What is your major malfunction, fruit monkey?  Your name's fruit monkey. 
[03:19:00]  A banana in your footlocker.  I want you and Betsy to tie me up and hold a blanket over me and beat me with soap and a sock.  What an ass.  What a complete.  That's fantastic.  Ass.  That's a classic.  He really is a classic.  Great.  He would say it right to his face.  Hey, fruit monkey. 
[03:19:30]  Someone says it right to someone's face ever.  And he probably had a smile and like, yeah, yes, okay, Pat.  Oh, God.  Deal with a Pat O'Brien.  Just what a horny guy.  That's some fantastic stuff.  We'll see what comes out in the future on Pat O'Brien.  I think his job's in jeopardy.  You think?  He's still on their website, the Insider website.  They have him on there with his bio and his bio lists all of his credits and how long he's been in the business. 
[03:20:00]  His long career, which ends now.  Right.  Well, it's controversy.  Controversy sells.  Of course they're going to keep it up there for a while.  And then.  Because everyone's searching on any info they can on Pat O'Brien now.  They have his statement that he made.  Oh.  Thanking his fans.  Oh, really?  And saying that he's entering rehab.  And that he wants to get back to work as quickly as possible.  Sure he does.  Good luck with that one.  Yeah, that ain't happening anytime soon, huh?  This isn't something you could just walk out of rehab and go back to work. 
[03:20:30]  How do you put that suit on and sit there and talk about Britney Spears gaining a little weight or any of the other inane celebrity stories when you're the biggest story?  You know?  I didn't see anything on the Insider website about his story.  You know they all are sitting there going, oh my God, I want to dig into this.  We want to do this story.  You know they're doing it on Entertainment Tonight and all the other ones.  With that wacky voice lady. 
[03:21:00]  Maybe now he'll be honest on the show.  Talk honestly.  Nah.  You just look at the camera.  If you want to fuck me, just call.  Right.  Do something.  Britney Spears put a little weight on it.  Seems like there's a little more jiggler to step.  Don't get me wrong.  I'd still eat her ass after a workout.  Me, Betsy, the fruit monkey.  We all get together.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[03:21:30]  Calling the fruit monkey.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  I've got this feeling so appealing for us to get together and sing.  Fuck, fuck.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Stick it up your ass.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, banana phone.  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches, it's the best, beat the rest, cellular, modular, interactive, modular, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone, ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, banana phone, it's no baloney, it ain't a phony, my cellular, banana phone, ah, let's go to the phones, I love the banana phone song, so do I, let's talk to Joe, Joe, what's up? 
[03:22:00]  I've got one of the guys to kill me, just a little nugget for you, I think we need to go in the direction of the fruit monkey and the chimps that ate the guy's ass in general.  I want you to bite my fingers off, tear my lips off, eat half of my ass. 
[03:22:30]  Good job, guys, good vacation.  Oh, thanks, Joe.  Could you bite Betsy's thumb off first, I'll push her away and you can eat my ass.  Fruit monkey.  Oh, wow.  Oh, he's insane, he really is.  Scott in Wisconsin, what's up, Scott?  Yeah, I think that guy, great show, by the way, but I think he's a little manic-depressive.  A little manic?  Yeah, when you're like that, you get those feelings like that, that you're, you know, you're God and you can fuck anything like that. 
[03:23:00]  Dude, that had booze and coke written all over it, those phone calls.  You don't make those unless you are so drunk and coked out.  You're missing one.  What?  Booze, coke, Viagra.  You think he was sitting there with a big heart on, too?  Big raging purple one, just pulsating.  Pulsating and damn things mocking him.  Laughing at him that there's no chick there.  Right.  Come on, call again, asshole. 
[03:23:30]  It's only been three minutes.  I can't sit here in your lap all fucking day.  All right, cock.  His penis is talking to him.  His dick is talking to him.  What are you doing?  Like Anthony Hopkins in that movie Magic.  Oh, the puppet turns around?  Come on, asshole.  Pick up the phone.  I'm trying.  I'm trying to get this together.  What are you doing?  I'm calling.  I'm calling this chick.  I'm trying to wheel and deal with Betsy.  You're not closing the deal, stupid.  All right, I'll call again.  Look, I want to fuck you.  My cock wants to fuck you. 
[03:24:00]  I don't know what to do.  Jesus Christ.  I'll call the fruit monkey.  Keep the fruit monkey out of this faggot.  His cock.  His big, raging hard-on, sitting in his lap, taunting.  I must blame my penis, ladies and gentlemen.  If you're into this, bite Betsy's thumbs off.  His little coats.  I love it.  This is the time when Jim was upset that he got some bad coffee. 
[03:24:30]  I think this is when Derek did his one food run ever.  I believe you're correct, sir.  Yeah.  But then he graduated to board op, but he's been doing great ever since.  I got to just say, he's probably one of the best board ops any radio show could have.  But this is a classic bit of Jim being a fancy man, and it became an awesome sweeper,  in which Steve says coffee like it has an A in it.  Danny?  Coffee, Diva!  What is this? 
[03:25:00]  If someone farts or...  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into this bit with a reading?  What is this?  What's the problem, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Kill him!  I don't know, but...  Oh, boy.  Derek?  Why is your face turning red?  Warm up your vocal cords.  You might be reading.  You might have to warm up that...  Where do we get our coffee every day? 
[03:25:30]  All right, what's going on?  No one knows what's going on.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  Exactly.  But if it said Starbucks, you'd know that immediately.  Oh, yeah.  Ben, don't explain what's happening on the air, because people hate your voice.  Stop ruining things, Ben.  You're ruining the show, Ben.  I don't like...  This is why...  Two reasons I don't like this coffee.  It doesn't taste good, and I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  Yeah, I know Starbucks is a big, you know, big world order type of thing. 
[03:26:00]  Yup.  You betcha.  But at least they're not funding terrorism.  I will not support the savages.  How much money from one cup of coffee, from like a dollar cup of coffee, do you think goes to Al-Qaeda?  I'm not saying necessarily Al-Qaeda, but...  I would say probably 15 cents out of every buck.  You might be right.  Yeah.  And even if it doesn't go to Al-Qaeda, it just goes to a guy who will watch a video of the insurgents and go,  well, I see their point, and I just don't want him to have my 15 cents.  You don't want to support that, my friend.  Absolutely not.  You're insane.  I'm not insane.  I won't support it.  I will not. 
[03:26:30]  Did you get that cup of coffee from a raghead?  No, I got it downstairs.  Exactly.  The ones that won't let me in.  Sometimes I come in at five to six or whatever.  Oh, we're closed.  I'm like, can I buy coffee?  No.  That's a normal, like, joint, though.  That's not one of those corner delis.  It's not whatever it is.  I don't like it.  I like Starbucks.  Starbucks, I like the big company that mushes the mom-and-pop awful companies.  Only because their coffee is always stale.  So did you tell him to go to Starbucks and he didn't?  You want to taste this?  You want to taste this and see how enjoyable this is?  Why don't you throw it against the wall? 
[03:27:00]  I'm not a diva.  I'm not a diva.  I just want Starbucks coffee.  Diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  Why are you picking up your Rent Boys book?  I don't know.  Look, I like him.  He's a good kid.  He's got a great smile.  But we all know the rules.  Oh, God.  The show's going to turn gay again.  It's not going to turn gay.  I just pray there's a couple out there that wants to try to become the sexiest state in America.  When you ask the intern for coffee and they know where you like your coffee from and they come back. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, why did you go downstairs?  First of all, he didn't say anything about Starbucks.  And I haven't been on a coffee run in like three weeks.  Oh, really?  Three or four weeks.  Really?  Well, I haven't saluted the flag in a little while, but I still know to do it when it's in front of me.  Oh, God.  Is it valid?  Either way, as your punishment, because you're a fine young man and you work very hard, but this was inexcusable,  there will have to be another coffee run for Starbucks, and you're going to have to read, young man.  It's a very short paragraph from there to there, and I want you to read with dignity, and I want you to read proudly. 
[03:28:00]  No laughing.  Hold on.  Anthony wants to explain, because there's a lot of new listeners.  This is Jim's punishment.  This is the only bit that Jim Norton has officially brought to the O&A show.  Ever.  He contributes very nicely on a daily basis, but as far as bringing bits to the table, he usually doesn't.  But he decided to bring this one to the table.  He brought in a lovely book entitled Rent Boys.  Don't fold it back.  You're bending the cover.  I like that picture.  Rent Boys.  On the cover is a nude man, young man, covering his sensitives with his hand, 
[03:28:30]  and another hand tweaking his nipple on the cover.  And it's filled with stories of gay sex.  And Jim hands out these punishments to people around here when they do something wrong.  And the punishment is to read from the book.  You have to read seriously.  You can't laugh it off like, you know, make a joke about it, because then it just comes off like a joke.  And what happens if he laughs during it? 
[03:29:00]  Do you want him to pull his pants down and you can paddle him?  No, but if he laughs, believe me, I'll have him reading so much that his lips will be too tired to laugh.  If he thinks Kaufman did some reading of The Great Gatsby, he will certainly be doing some...  Love Andy Kaufman references.  Hey, hey, hey.  She gets a mood in here.  It's like a Mark Perino show with an intern saying things like this.  Great, huh?  You need a PlayStation young fella.  Dave from Jersey, he says, look, I never went for coffee there, but I know Norton loves Starbucks.  That's right, Dave from Jersey. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  And I like the fact that Starbucks is always fresh.  I'm not whoring for Starbucks.  I just like the way...  It tastes the same every time.  I would rather be like a hip and cool guy and a hip and cool...  That's what you like.  I'd rather support a smaller...  Hey, I don't go with the big ones, man.  But the coffee always stinks in these places.  I'm sorry.  Stinks.  It's different every different place you go.  Every place.  You're safe at Starbucks.  I like the flavor.  There you go.  Don't read ahead, young man.  Just be surprised as it happens.  All right.  Let her rip.  Yeah, enjoy.  All right.  He withdraws, slowly, gently.  He stands up. 
[03:30:00]  I reach over and peel the rubber away, letting it drop to the floor.  I hug him to me and place a now semi-flaccid cock in my mouth.  It no longer smells scrub.  I lick it.  I roll over on my back and hang my head over the edge of the bed.  I begin stroking my cock, intent now on my own orgasm.  He bends his hard prick so that it slides easily into my mouth and down my throat.  As he begins to fuck my face, I close my eyes and breathe in the marvelous musky scent of his sweaty, heavy ball sack. 
[03:30:30]  Turn it off.  I begin to cum.  He cannot stop me now.  My pleasure is so intense, I begin to choke on his flesh deep inside my throat.  It smells like...  Oh, he tastes delicious.  Victory.  I will be generous with this boy.  Very generous.  Good job.  Thanks, fella.  Catch some coffee medium with skim up there. 
[03:31:00]  It's going to smell like his musty, heavy sack.  Look, that was harder for us than it was for you.  That was difficult.  I don't like to meet out to the punishments.  That was a bad one.  You could tell that was really, really bad.  Dude, I don't like...  Do you think I like handing these out?  I think you do.  It helps people.  We really do.  Young Eric had a misstep the other day and did some reading.  And might I say, he has been in tip-top shape ever since. 
[03:31:30]  Opie and Anthony's best.  Most bestest sweeper.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Number five.  What is this?  All right.  What's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks. 
[03:32:00]  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to have a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism. 
[03:32:30]  It's Opie and Anthony's best sandwiches.  I mean, bits.  Best bits ever.  It's Opie and Anthony's best bits ever.  There's more of it.  So don't go and play any games.  I'm not allowed to be alone.  XM Satellite Radio brings you great college football action.  Wake up every morning for college football coast to coast.  We have a black football.

[03:34:30]  Frankie Blue Part 1?  Yeah, which one?  That's the intro.  That's the breaking story.  So that's when they played...  Did they play the tape?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm pretty sure.  Alright.  Own his best bits.  So you think this is funny, the Frankie Blue thing?  I do.  I love it.  Anytime you can...  It's very voyeuristic.  Even though it's going out to a bunch of people on the radio, I think this is very voyeuristic.  It's an uncomfortable situation.  It's somebody put in a position they shouldn't have been in. 
[03:35:00]  Well, I guess what happened, our old radio station, WNEW.  Yeah.  There's a curse with our old station ever since we left.  Ever since we left, it's just been in the toilet.  They can't figure out what to do with the station.  And it's just failing miserably.  Ratings are always in the toilet.  They have tried...  How many different formats?  They've tried three or four since we left.  And the one that did the best was the three months that they played Christmas music last year.  Right.  They started like at Halloween and played it through New Year. 
[03:35:30]  And it did better than any format they put on there.  Well, our old company, they hired this dope John Sykes, who was supposed to help the radio division.  And the radio division has been a disaster ever since he took the helm.  And now they're just kind of paying him, and he's like in a little office, and no one bothers him because he's under contract.  And they're going to fire him real soon.  But he had no business trying to run the radio division of Viacom.  Kind of pumped Joel Hollander up into that position.  He's the genius.  Joel Hollander is an amazing radio guy, and he will right the ship. 
[03:36:00]  But this guy, John Sykes, which is just a waste of space, an asshole, a two-faced fuck.  You know, he told Anthony and I when we did the Sex with Sam thing, that crazy-haired dick, that we were going to be okay.  He said we were going to be okay, and then all of a sudden he just blew us off, never talked to us again, and then just hid behind lawyers and his secretary and stuff.  Never could get him on the phone again.  And we find out how he didn't like the show, didn't like what we were doing.  That's the type of executive you want running your radio division, a guy that doesn't have balls and will tell you to your face what's going on, you know? 
[03:36:30]  Oh, didn't he think it was bad for kids, the show?  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, he thought he knew what he was doing, and we get fired.  And the station has been a complete disaster ever since.  And the radio division, quite frankly, has been a complete disaster ever since.  They've lost millions upon millions of dollars, and in the end it was John Sykes' fault.  Simple as that.  Joel Hollander wasn't running the radio division back then.  He just wasn't.  And, anyway, it's unheard of in radio history to have a station that has been floundering for as long as NEW. 
[03:37:00]  It just doesn't happen.  When that happens at a station, they fix it.  They fix the problem.  Right.  Especially in New York.  Right, it's the number one mark in the country.  Right.  You can't have a radio property just sitting there with one rating.  And a history like NEW has.  Yeah.  It's in last place.  There are radio stations that don't even have a signal, a strong signal in Manhattan that are beating our old station.  Easy listening music stations from Long Island beat it out. 
[03:37:30]  Right.  It's ridiculous.  So getting back to the Frankie Blue thing in our old radio station that has just been in the toilet ever since we left.  Falling apart.  Because they really thought they knew what they were doing by firing us and moving on.  Oh, yeah, they figured they would compete with other stations that are doing very well around New York.  Because, boy, there's a win situation.  Go head-to-head against stations that are just entrenched in the market, have great ratings doing what they're doing.  Because people will just change their habits like that for the same thing they could get in the place that they've been for years and years and years. 
[03:38:00]  Now, RuPaul is what, their morning person now, weren't there?  It was RuPaul.  Person, that's good.  Oh, whatever, yeah.  Morning guy.  It's a guy.  Morning parental disappointment.  RuPaul, the drag queen, does mornings over there.  Okay.  When I sit there and you have to listen to some people go, RuPaul, she is so pretty.  It's got a cock.  It's a guy.  Boy, you're a buzzkill.  Fine.  So then, big smooth back. 
[03:38:30]  So then the old company gets a bright idea to hire this Frankie Blue guy because he was really good at KTU, I guess.  What was KTU?  Kind of like a dance mix station?  Yeah, kind of like commercial dance music.  Like dance music.  So they're like, well, we'll hire the guy that made KTU great and we'll put him on NEW and he'll have the same success over here.  Right.  Well, so far he hasn't done anything except get drunk at Christmas gatherings.  Oh, and Earl was there, too. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, our old pal Earl was there, I should say.  And Earl did not give us this tape.  I want to go on the record and tell you he did not have anything to do with the tape we're about to play.  Right.  He didn't.  Okay.  So Frankie Blue was at the Christmas luncheon a couple days ago.  A Christmas luncheon?  They did a Christmas luncheon and I guess everyone got completely hammered.  I would, too, if I was working over there.  As a matter of fact, I did many times.  Yeah, he got destroyed, everyone else. 
[03:39:30]  And with the ratings that just came out, I think he had a few extra shots.  Mm-hmm.  Because he's probably thinking, well, oh, my God, I'm a fraud at this point.  Oh, boy.  So then he goes back to the station and he gets into some kind of argument with the DJ that was supposed to go on the air.  Now, if he was a little tipsy at the time, I'm thinking it probably wasn't one of those good, legitimate arguments where you have a point.  I've been in arguments with drunk people.  They don't usually make good points during arguments.  You ever notice that?  What is that?  Why you got to wear that fucking shirt?  Ooh, there's a good argument. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, this one will last about 18 hours straight.  Yeah.  So that's what he does.  He goes over there, gets in a little tiff.  And it's the DJ that's supposed to go on the air.  She pretty much runs out of the station crying or something.  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  Oh, boy.  But something happened and she just ran out.  So now someone has to do the radio show.  So who do they get to do the show?  Well, Frankie Blue is the boss over there.  He decides, oh, fuck her.  I'll just do it.  He's going to take the mic. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, he's not a DJ?  He's not on air?  He's the program guy.  He's a legendary, quote, programmer here in New York.  Was he ever on the air?  You'll see how legendary he is in a minute here.  And then he goes, oh, fuck, I don't need her.  I'll just do her shift and I'll do probably a better job.  Now he's doing it for WNEW.  During this, he's talking about KTU, which is their arch rival in competition.  He's just using the KTU call letters.  He makes a mistake and actually says, you know, on 1027 WKTU. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, KTU.  And it's NEW.  Yeah, that's the station they're trying to beat.  Yeah.  Oops.  Oh, they must have been loving this at KTU.  I bet they play this and just laugh their balls off.  So Ben has been playing this all morning in the office just laughing like an idiot.  Like Ben.  I think it's hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Earl's there.  You know, Earl jumps on the air at some point.  Earl was the producer.  Board op.  Yeah.  He's the board op guy.  The girl that does the show is supposed to do that.  And Earl hits the buttons when she goes to commercials and stuff like that.  He operates the board. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  So he had to board op for Frankie, who's all hammered.  Right.  And who's his boss.  And who's his boss.  So Earl, I guess you hear him chime in a couple of times, I guess just out of nervousness.  And, you know, he must have been sitting there going, oh, my God.  Dude, this guy's hammered.  He can't even talk.  He's stammering.  He's forgetting words.  He hiccups in one word and it makes the word two words.  Yeah.  And Earl's just like, you can tell, he's really nervous.  And then you've got to understand, too, this is one of those radio stations where you talk 
[03:42:00]  really quickly between the music.  The music's the most important thing.  If you're talking more than 30 seconds, you're not doing your job.  He's talking for about four minutes here.  Oh, I know.  We cut it down, but we'll play about two and a half minutes of this.  But he's just babbling about nothing, saying the wrong call letters.  This is the boss of the radio station that was supposed to put WNEW back on the map.  Here you go.  In New York radio.  The boss.  So here, you know, I've got to be honest.  If they got Frankie Blue drunk every day to do a radio show, the ratings would go through  the roof. 
[03:42:30]  I'd listen every day.  Absolutely.  And I hate that type of music, but that's the type of thing they should do.  Just get drunks on the air.  Drunk DJs.  Drunk DJs.  I love this song.  This is the fucking boss.  I love this song.  He's fucking hammered.  Hammered.  And don't think for a second that this is some kind of relaxed, laid-back delivery.  Yeah, this is not radio from the 70s.  No, all the DJs were encouraged to talk like this.  This guy's hammered.  This is the type of station where, you know, your voice has to be way up there, like, WKTU. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, high energy.  Summer, everybody.  Don't forget RuPaul at the morning, Ed.  Yeah.  High energy.  Your next chance to win $2,000.  Coming up with RuPaul tomorrow morning, right here.  RuPaul, let's get back to the music.  Right.  The new mix, W-N-A-W.  That's the delivery you're supposed to have.  Right.  And he completely messes up.  You're supposed to hit the post, which is stop talking right when the vocals kick in.  Yeah.  He goes right over the place.  Oh, I know.  Stomps on it.  And he's the boss.  Uh-huh. 
[03:43:30]  I love this song.  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been, um, giving you a chance to win $50,000 in cash.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That is snotted.  Wow.  Hey, this is Frankie Blue.  This was the guy that was supposed to get N.E.W. out of the toilet. 
[03:44:00]  He's taking the record off the turntable.  You think he's going to use the turntable?  Oh, I take pleasure in this.  God.  That dumb station.  They really stink.  Oh.  In the mix, 102.7 redo.  And plus win a Toyota Scion.  And I think that is going to happen tomorrow morning. 
[03:44:30]  Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., Ricky, RuPaul, Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house like Publishing Clearance.  Publishing.  Why?  Publishing Clearance?  Did he try to say, like, Publishers Clearinghouse?  Yeah, Publishing Clearance.  Publishing Clearance.  Publishing Clearance.  Oh, man. 
[03:45:00]  Hey, I've been snotted on the air a couple of times, but never.  Your station is cursed.  Oh, the devil.  Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house like Publishing Clearance.  Or whether it's a house or it's a job.  We're coming to you, baby.  We're going to find you, and we're going to reward you with $50,000 and a brand new Toyota.  And I don't see how you cannot be happy about that. 
[03:45:30]  This is Frankie Blue.  So make sure you're listening tomorrow about 8 a.m.  50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner.  What?  That means they're giving away 50 people who are going to win a grand?  Wait, 50 grand prize winner.  50 winners of the grand prize?  Or is it 50 grand prize winner? 
[03:46:00]  I don't know.  Or is it a real drunk guy on the air?  And when you do one of these shows, you know, you have to speak perfectly.  Oh, yeah.  I know I speak like an idiot.  My grammar stinks, but it doesn't really matter.  It's a talk show.  You just go with the flow, and if I fuck up, you know, someone's going to jump on me and tell me so.  But at these radio stations, everything has to be just perfect.  Right.  And you're not supposed to just babble and babble.  You've got to get back to the music.  Yeah.  As far as I'm concerned, you guys never fuck up.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny. 
[03:46:30]  Very sweet.  Just enjoy your hustler and let us do the heavy lifting here, okay?  Isn't that funny?  50 grand prize winner of the redo contest of the winner of the Toyota Scion.  Come on, baby.  You know you want it.  If you have qualified in the past several weeks, we're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick the winner, and... 
[03:47:00]  I thought he was really going to go for it.  RuPaul's going to dip his fat cock in that.  He's going to put some Elmer's glue on the tip of his big fat cock and...  Because that's a guy, you know.  Dip it into the winner and pick out one to...  You know, when we were in the bathroom, I was holding RuPaul's fat cock.  This is the boss.  I love this. 
[03:47:30]  Winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick the winner, and we're going to find you.  Earl lost the line right there.  It takes all day.  It's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right, we have the armored truck.  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  But more important than that, we've got the best music in town.  So why don't you give me a call?  This is Frankie Blue for Yvonne Velasquez. 
[03:48:00]  And telephone number is, if you want to make a request, is 1-877-MIX-1027.  So give me a call.  Okay, baby?  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, baby.  If you're in your car right now, chances are you're sitting in traffic.  And then he goes back on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we got one more.  This is where he screws up the call letters.  This is really funny.  Which is just probably the biggest radio faux pas you could ever make is screwing up those calls. 
[03:48:30]  And especially when you screw them up by replacing them with the competition's call letters.  Right.  He's supposed to, for people all over the country, say WNEW.  Right.  But it says KTU, which is their arch rival.  Pick the two stations in your city that battle it out between each other.  And picture one of the jocks being drunk and making the mistake of using the other station's call.  So here's the boss at our old station.  I'd drink, too, if I was the boss over at that shithole.  Completely hammered. 
[03:49:00]  Ratings are in the toilet.  He has to go on the air.  He thought he could handle it.  And this is some more of him doing his little show.  Mix 1027.  The new Mix 1027.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for Tamar.  Like all the old Foster Brooks.  I'm so excited for Tamar.  Oh, Tamar.  Oh.  Tamar.  A drunken hiccup comes out of him in mid-word. 
[03:49:30]  Nice buzz, man.  Wow.  That must have been a great Christmas luncheon.  Must have been luncheon.  What time was this going on?  I guess at luncheon.  He's on the air at the 7 to 12 shift at night.  So the luncheon was probably, you know, what, noon, 1?  Noon to 3, 4 maybe?  Love the nooners, man.  Pounding them during the nooners.  Here we go.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for Tamar.  I got Ricky and Rue. 
[03:50:00]  Coming in in the morning.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Putting a hand in the big old barrel.  Picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner.  $50,000.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo.  Oh, there it is.  Winner of the KTU Mix 102.  Ooh, where the hell do I work? 
[03:50:30]  Is he going to start singing Janis Joplin tunes?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  This doesn't sound like just alcohol, by the way.  That's my opinion.  Dude, this sounds like you're fired.  Yeah.  This is a firing offense.  Yeah, because this is the boss.  This isn't some stupid DJ that has a coke problem that you're trying to take care of.  What?  She should be fired for walking off the shift.  What kind of boss?  Dude, did he just... 
[03:51:00]  Did he tell her to leave?  Oh, he told her to leave?  It just shows you that the old place is still a fucking train wreck.  Yeah, it is.  It's a dump.  Yeah, smart move.  Getting rid of Opie and Anthony.  The only thing that was happening over there.  Even when you were there, it stunk.  Except for Ron and Fez.  Those guys did okay.  Well, us and Ron and Fez, we kept the ship going.  Yep.  They were making a lot of money off our show and Ron and Fez.  They should have backed us.  Instead, they got this mess.  Two years later, two and a half years later, they still have nothing.  Some of the most entertaining programming I've ever heard out of that station, though.  Right here. 
[03:51:30]  I would put this guy on the air every day drunk.  Every day drunk.  I would listen every freaking day.  And he's, quote, a legend in New York radio.  Wow.  A fiery wreck today on our wreck cam.  Boy, that's a bad one.  That is a bad one today.  How embarrassed do you think he is this morning if he's up yet?  Oh, my God.  When you wake up sober and you'll hear it, you'll be like, ugh.  All hungover, shaking, feeling a little nauseous.  Your head is pounding and your phone's ringing.  Frankie. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, Frankie, pick up.  Pick up.  Yeah, I heard your air.  I heard your air.  What, are you stupid?  You fucking drunk?  You got a call from Infinity yet?  You will.  Yeah, you will.  Take a couple of aspirin and get your ass out of bed, because I'm sure you'll be in a meeting today.  Can you say fired?  Fired.  Yeah, call up I'll be an Anthony.  They'll give you some pointers on what to do during your time off. 
[03:52:30]  You idiot.  And it's not like nobody's heard this clip.  This clip just hasn't been circulating through the radio circles all morning, you know?  Dude, I emailed it to everybody this morning.  Frankie, it's your mom.  Hi.  How you doing?  Dr. Phil said when you give something up to replace it with something else, so I was  good to see you giving up the NEW call letters and replacing it with the KTU call letters,  you stupid fuck.  I'm your mother, so I can say that.  Come on over.  We'll do shots.  I love you. 
[03:53:00]  Isn't that great?  There's just a little more here.  I got to hear the KTU thing again.  I hear there's a third clip.  No, no.  This is it.  No, this is the...  Rumor has it as a third clip.  Well, I think this, at this point, is when he was removed after this break.  He was removed from the station.  Who removed him?  The general manager.  Oh, that is not good.  The GM came in and took him off the air?  He's the Mac Daddy at every radio station.  Doesn't go much higher than the GM.  Who finished the shift? 
[03:53:30]  I would assume they probably just played music.  Probably just played music and Earl pushed the button.  That's good.  When your big boss has to come into the studio and you're supposed to be in charge of all  your DJs and tell you to get the fuck off.  Yeah.  Get off.  You had it.  You are so fired.  Go home.  Fired.  Come out like the manager going to the mound.  Just get out.  Get out.  Do you got the KTU line in there again?  Did you rewind it a little?  I got to hear him screw up on the calls again.  Yeah.  He's supposed to say WNEW once again.  As winner.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest. 
[03:54:00]  And also you win a Toyota Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel.  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fight that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 102.7.  He's stepping all over.  He's supposed to be done by the time those lyrics kick in.  That is like the most important thing in that type of radio. 
[03:54:30]  That type of radio?  Man, you got to hit the post.  Yeah, like it's called hit the post.  Right, exactly.  What did he say?  We're going to fuck the winner?  That sounded like it.  Oh, is that where they thought he cursed?  Yeah.  I didn't even notice that until we just listened to it.  The older Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel.  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fight that winner.  Fight. 
[03:55:00]  What?  What was that?  I think he said fuck.  They're going to fuck that winner.  I think he was going to say fuck and was able to stop just in time.  Fight that winner.  That's not a word.  And if they put their hand in the barrel, they're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fight that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 1027, Frankie Blue, what's happening? 
[03:55:30]  Tries to have the cool little thing like he's out.  Like, yeah, I meant to step all over the vocals.  Frankie Blue, what's happening, baby?  All I know is the FCC should hear about that.  Oh, and they're going to fuck that winner.  At least you guys never said that.  Huh?  Right in the asshole.  Frankie Blue, baby.  They're going to stick it in the barrel, and they're going to pull it out, and fuck the 
[03:56:00]  fucking fucker.  Frankie Blue, baby.  On KTU.  W-N-E-double.  W.  The O.P.  Anthony.  K-N-B-C.  Yeah.  On the Rock of Boston, BCN.  Where am I?  On W-D-R-U-N-K.  Well, this story is developing, but I do believe he's fired. 
[03:56:30]  Fired.  How long has he been there?  Not too long, man.  He was supposed to be the big hire that was going to turn around that crap hole.  That was it.  He was going to be the guy.  That's the turnpike, that big fire.  Jersey turnpike.  You know what?  That's got to be doing to traffic.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We have audio of the general manager coming in to Frankie Blue.  You're fired.  Do you have the audio of Frankie Blue after he was fired?  If I may. 
[03:57:00]  A little more.  All right.  You're fired.  Wow, you had to tell him twice and try to console him, I guess.  It's over, Johnny.  Aw.  And then Frankie Blue.  Okay.  We got some Frankie Blue audio here?  Yeah.  Don't you do it!  Aw.  Don't you!  I got nowhere else to go!  Aw.  I got nowhere else to go!  Yeah!  I got nothing else. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah!  I love when it's someone else, man.  Oh, it is a treat when it's not us.  All right.  Well, we have to take a break.  These guys are getting bored.  How about this?  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  I think we got a couple more things to get to before the eggnog drinking contest for the  MiFi.  That's right, baby.  How about we start the contest at 8 o'clock so these guys know?  8 o'clock, we'll start the eggnog drinking contest. 
[03:58:00]  8 o'clock, we're starting the contest and fuck them.  So they got a half hour if they want to, you know, maybe get coffee or something.  They got a half hour to get there.  Let them know, Hawk.  That's right, baby.  All right.  That's okay, baby.  Frankie Blue here, baby.  We're going to have a winner and we're going to fuck them.  And we're going to...  I can play that all morning.  Oh, it's classic.  Ben, good call, by the way.  I wasn't sure if we should go with it.  I love it.  I wasn't sure if it was that good, but it is hilarious.  This is the Opie and Anthony show here at Sirius Satellite Radio. 
[03:58:30]  That's right, baby.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, it's E-Rock and we're up to Norton's Monster Rain.  In this segment, Norton explains about a game he used to play as a kid where he'd hide under  a porch with another little boy, but Norton tells the story a hell of a lot better than  I am doing right now.  So it's Norton's Monster Rain on the best bits of Opie and Anthony.  You're a completely different entity from what you are as a younger man. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, I've been drinking when I was 18.  I'm sober since almost half my life.  It was the booze that was doing all that?  Yeah.  And the drugs?  Yeah.  How do you figure at 18 to stop drinking booze?  I don't get that.  Because I was just starting to get into all the drugs and the alcohol at that point going,  wow, look at what this one could do.  I think I was a sex addict from the age of, which I still am, but I think from the years  of like second grade, I'm not exaggerating, I was sexually active.  Never with an adult though.  You know, unlucky little fella.  No, man.  You know what?  So that addiction was always there.  If you're going to bring the subject up, I got to say something had to happen to you. 
[03:59:30]  I had to.  It wouldn't surprise me.  You are a cute little boy.  Oh, I've seen photos.  I want to molest myself.  Dude.  Blonde hair, eager, doe-eyed.  I blew up a young picture of you and I put it in a paper bag in the toilet stall.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Because I've seen your act a lot, as you know.  We travel and I mean, some of the stuff you talk about, I'm like, you have to have first  person knowledge as far as some of this stuff goes.  I don't know.  What was your first anyway whatsoever sexual experience? 
[04:00:00]  It might have been, it was either getting blown and blowing one of my little friends  when I was like in second grade or like I was.  Wait, wait, did I just hear right?  Oh yeah, when I was a little, sure, I was in second grade with little boys, you jerk,  yeah.  Wait, wait, you and another little boy went down on each other.  Absolutely.  It was called Monster.  Okay, that's it, Ovi.  It was called Monster Race.  Oh yeah, but I was probably in second, that was, that stuff happened when I was in like  second grade.  In second grade.  Hold on, you make it too easy because I've been keeping a notepad since we've been off the 
[04:00:30]  air, right?  Yeah.  And I was at the Montreal Comedy Festival, again, the quantum leaping all over the place.  And I went to Montreal and all our pals are up there doing their thing, Voss and whatever,  everybody.  And Norton was doing this showcase, it was the Dirty Show or something like that?  No, it was called, it was Jeff Singer put on a show called Confessing It.  It was hilarious.  You tell a true story and I call it a true story.  So I'm sitting in the audience listening to Norton admit to all these Canadians that he  used to play a game called Monster Rain when he was a kid.  Monster Rain?  Monster Rain.  So I quickly got a sharpie, wrote it right on my palm, making sure that the ink wouldn't 
[04:01:00]  like fade out anytime soon.  What's Monster Rain?  What, you want to explain Monster?  I thought you would, you wouldn't confess this on the air.  Oh, please, who cares?  I was in second grade.  I thought it was going to take us an hour to get this story out.  Please, no, I don't give a shit.  I was in second grade and my friend and I, I don't even remember his name, would play  this game where it would be, we would pretend that it was raining Monster Rain and we would  go under a porch and blow each other.  I don't remember how it happened, why there was Monster Rain involved. 
[04:01:30]  That was like a code word.  I honestly don't remember where it came from.  Let's play Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  And you'd run under the porch.  Yeah.  And it would just, it's all very vague memories.  Wait, but that's...  At that age, would it end in any way?  No, I don't think I got to run.  I didn't know.  Wait, that's second grade?  Yes.  I know all that because that was in Edison.  I moved to North Brunswick a Halloween of fourth grade, which was obviously the beginning  of the school year in fourth grade.  So that stuff happened like long before that.  I still remember the first girl, I don't remember the first girl I kissed, but I remember 
[04:02:00]  the first pornographic picture I saw.  I remember the first girl, Janice, whose last name I do remember, but won't say it.  I remember kissing her little lips and putting my face on her ass.  That's where I got my ass fetish from.  And how old were you then?  Second or third grade.  She was like a year older than me.  He's getting action.  I remember trying to get this girl to sit on my lap, naked, next to some sticker bushes.  I'm like, you can either sit on my lap or you can sit on the sticker bushes.  And she picked the sticker bushes.  You wonder why I have no self-esteem.  This was last night, right?  This was very recently, yeah. 
[04:02:30]  She was in third grade.  I pulled up with my Saturn.  Help!  Mommy's sick!  Get in the car!  I don't like sticker bushes!  Wow.  So that was the first sexual experience in second grade?  No, no.  I don't remember if it was Janice first.  I don't remember it, to be honest.  Would this be very mutual between everybody?  Or were you sort of a predator back then?  No, I was younger.  I was the same age as.  But it wasn't any abuse.  There was no, like, adults involved.  No, I know.  I completely understand.  Normal experimentation.  There are kids who do things like that. 
[04:03:00]  In kindergarten, my first experience whatsoever was in kindergarten.  And it was a girl that lived down the street.  And we used to go into the shed behind her house.  And she would show me her hanging.  She would show me her hiney.  She was some, like, Dutch girl.  That's a lot more normal than Monster Rain, though.  Maybe so.  But I also, I had no clue, by the way.  But this was kindergarten.  Where to take that?  You show an ass.  You get a little tingle and stuff, you know, looking at a girl's ass. 
[04:03:30]  But where you go from there?  I didn't have a clue.  I wouldn't know to play Monster Rain.  I was such a late bloomer.  I had no idea what my stuff did until, like, I was 12.  I'm not even kidding.  Oh, no, no.  I got the famous movies in grammar school.  We've talked about this on past shows.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you go to grammar school thinking it's just going to be another regular day at school.  Another day of arts and crafts and, you know, milk and cookies.  Climbing the ropes in gym class and learning a little fake history, you know. 
[04:04:00]  Sure.  And the next thing you know, they're separating the boys from the girls.  And the gym, you go to the gym and they had the big door up.  The big separating door between the girls and boys.  And the next thing you know, you're in a room filled with guys.  And then the girls are on the other side.  You're like, uh-oh.  And then they showed you the film.  John is noticing he's growing hair in areas we didn't have hair before.  He's interested in girls. 
[04:04:30]  Love those films.  So...  They were hot.  So I saw that.  Hygiene is important at this time.  Yeah.  So is setting your alarm clock so you can get up even if a fire alarm goes off in your apartment room.  And so we saw the film.  And my, you know, my life, obviously like everyone else's, my life changed.  Like, oh, screw this, you know, playing baseball after school every day.  But then it was obvious that the teachers told the parents that they're showing the film.  Oh, because you're supposed to work with them when they get home.  When they get home.  So I think they even said something like, if you have any questions about the film you saw, 
[04:05:00]  we did tell your parents to expect some questions from you guys today.  From Junior when he comes home.  So this is a true story.  I went home and I climbed up into my apple tree and I wouldn't come down all afternoon.  And there's my dad at the bottom of the tree, you know, convincing me to come down so he  could talk about this stuff.  Why did you climb an apple tree in horror?  Jesus.  Because I just didn't want to hear my dad talking about sex.  Oh, simple as that.  What a shock. 
[04:05:30]  A shy boy named Opie climbing an apple tree.  Climbing a tree.  It was ridiculous.  And then his dad in the sheriff's suit standing below.  Now, come on down from that tree, Opie.  And then, you know, and then...  I don't know.  I'll get the ladder, Ange.  Yeah.  And then I remember staying up there all day.  And, you know, he finally convinced me to come down.  He sits me in the living room.  I remember this like it was yesterday.  Oh, boy.  This is a nightmare.  The next thing, he's like, don't worry.  It'll be okay.  And all of a sudden, he's like...  When me and your mother...  No! 
[04:06:00]  Yeah, he's explaining what mom's poo-ha does.  No, stop it!  And what mom's boobies do.  And I'm just horrified.  Yeah, that's traumatic.  And then I was asking...  Best to just learn it on the street.  And then I was asking...  You're serious.  I was asking what the back door does, if that has anything to do with it.  You asked your father what the back door does.  You asked if your mother spoke Greek?  I don't know.  Your mother hasn't given that up yet.  Does mommy give Greek lessons?  Well, because I think that was the day I sort of learned that there was more than one down there. 
[04:06:30]  I didn't know.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, well, you wouldn't be familiar with the female anatomy.  Oh, so there's a second one down there.  What does that do?  That's...  Yeah, you wouldn't be familiar with the female anatomy.  As a matter of fact, I think in first grade, I believed that in order to make babies, you had to do it in the girl's back door.  That's what I thought.  No, you only do that if you want a doggie.  That old gag.  Doggie style. 
[04:07:00]  Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.  Yeah, it was horrifying, though, when they'd show you that film.  And then, yeah, you'd go home, and I didn't...  My father wasn't living with us, so it was, you know...  Who would have to tell you?  Mom didn't even bother.  She didn't even bother trying to discuss this.  I learned it on the street.  I learned it, like, through second, third, fourth...  By fourth grade, I knew everything.  You learned it in a tree fort.  In a tree fort.  With a young man named Richard.  See, that was a difference.  He played Monster Rain.  Monster Rain. 
[04:07:30]  That is the best.  You gave that up way too easy.  I didn't care.  I'm talking about the story, but you also gave it up too easy when you were in second  grade.  Well, I didn't know how I used to get that same girl, Julie, to sit on my face because  she would wet her pants all the time.  I liked the way it smelled.  Oh, my God.  See, this is where it comes from.  That's true.  Do you think you were touched as a kid?  That's the point I'm making.  If not, I should have been.  You just don't know.  I almost hope so.  That would explain a lot.  God, I hope I didn't develop all this oddness on my own.  Would you ever do hypnosis or anything?  I've tried hypnosis, but it didn't... 
[04:08:00]  They actually tried to hypnotize me recently on Tough Crab, but I really am very difficult  to hypnotize because I can't relax.  Woke up from the hypnosis with his pants undone.  Hey, could you speak, Anthony, you ass?  Woke up from the hypnosis.  Sorry, I didn't get much sleep.  The alarm went off last night at my house.  You know, my sister's going to kill me, but I have to tell another story.  Uh-oh.  It involves your sister?  Yeah, this is a classic...  Talk slow.  This is a classic...  Stop.  Dude, don't touch your stuff while I'm talking about my sister.  I'm not.  I'm just a hitch.  Doesn't involve monster or rain, does it?  See, something else that listeners need to know, Jim touches himself throughout the 
[04:08:30]  whole show.  Oh, yeah.  When he starts hearing something hot, he grabs himself and goes like, oh.  Is there any way we could build a counter-hire...  It's a new show, by the way, Monster Rain Garage.  Is there any way we could build a counter-hire around Norton?  Dumb listeners say that.  You know, do you remember back in the NAW days, too?  Jim would actually take it out.  I mean, you...  Did you realize?  No, never.  No, never.  It was just guys in the room.  No, no.  Well, yeah, but you had it out.  No, no, no, no.  You said Monster Rain.  No, Dice warned me about that.  Dice warned me and said, there are times that Norton gets so turned on, he will take 
[04:09:00]  it out in front of other guys and start whacking.  Is that true or not?  I don't know if he said that, but it's not true that I would do it.  Jim, I'll tell you.  Shut up.  I've seen your dick.  Listen to me.  You have it out.  There were times when chicks were in studio, and there was Montana Gunn and another chick,  and they would have drank out of the mule, but Steve was filming, and I'm like,  no, I wouldn't take it out.  Not on camera.  Yeah.  You shy boy.  I know.  Yeah, but, you know, when the show gets sexy at times.  Sexy.  Yeah, I'm a pervert.  So what?  Yeah, I'm still waiting for that to happen.  I know.  No, yes.  We only got the gay out today. 
[04:09:30]  No, it might happen today, actually.  We got a couple escorts coming in.  Yeah, a couple goers, yeah.  Yeah, a couple goers.  So, when the show goes down that sexy road, all of a sudden, Norton will try to get your  attention and pretty much go, look.  Oh, yeah, I'll point at my lump.  Yeah, of course.  And he does it to everybody.  Like, look what I'm packing right now.  Why do you need to show other guys that you're packing?  Because he gets absolutely disgusted.  Oh, I know.  You pulled your bag out in bars.  One time I did that for a laugh.  But I was rubbing it against a girl's leg.  Yeah.  That was at the Long Island event. 
[04:10:00]  I'm talking to this chick.  That was it.  To make you guys laugh, though, I pulled my bag out and I'm like, I'm standing next  to her and I'm pushing it on my helmet against her leg while I'm talking.  She had jeans on.  I'm like, yeah.  And I'm like pointing at it.  Like, look, look, look, and my helmet's against her.  You ever pull your bag out and zip up your pants and try to convince the girl?  Not hard and try to convince the girl that you got gum stuck on your pants?  No, I didn't ever do that.  Why would I?  I was trying to go for a laugh and bomb horribly. 
[04:10:30]  I didn't mean to be so literal.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes I do try to be funny.  No, but I thought you were doing like a thing that guys do.  Actually, some guys do.  Actually, some guys do do that.  Someone told me about that.  Whatever.  Where were we?  Did you get a tingle in your stomach when it would be like, hey, you want to feel monster  rain coming?  See, I honestly don't remember.  I don't even think I got a rod, to be honest with you.  I don't remember.  I don't think I got a rod.  That is the weirdest story, man.  Yeah, it's very odd.  Monster rain.  You got to make up a word for it because it would sound funny. 
[04:11:00]  Hey, you want to give each other a head?  I don't think we knew the term.  I was too young to know the term.  I knew it was wrong or naughty.  How did you know it was something you did?  I tell you what.  How did you even know to put your mouth there?  Well, I don't know, to be honest with you.  Maybe he was my age, though, so it's like unless something happened in his life.  Maybe something happened to him.  But I remember that.  How do you know that?  Why are you pointing at me when you're saying maybe he?  No, no.  I meant he being the other guy involved in monster rain.  All right.  We'll do that one to you.  How about your point near the window?  I'll point out the window?  That's where the guy is. 
[04:11:30]  I'll point it to Nick and Mike.  Yeah, not to Nick and Mike.  That would have been monster murder.  But no, I remember the first...  A young boy choked to death today on the report.  That's right.  He was found with his teeth gone and curry in his lap.  Wow.  When I was a kid, I remember the first pornographic picture was two guys with mutton chops and  a girl in between them.  I'll never forget this.  And she's laying back.  One guy's having sex with her.  And one guy's got his mule in her mouth.  Like her head is back hanging over.  So maybe that's how I knew.  I don't remember.  But I still remember that like it was yesterday.  It must have just looked like Chewbacca down there, too, right? 
[04:12:00]  I don't remember.  I just remember the guy's mutton chops and her mouth on his mule.  That is wild.  So that was the code to get some action.  Monster Rain?  Yeah.  I don't even remember if I made it.  Imagine Jim going to his mom.  Mom, going outside to play Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  Okay, Jimmy.  Have fun.  So Monster Rain, if the rain hit you, something bad would happen.  So you'd have to get out of the rain, right?  Is that a gimmick?  I think so.  So you had to take the potion.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  Drink out of this.  It's an antidote for Monster Rain. 
[04:12:30]  I need the antidote.  Don't want the monster to get just swallow it all.  In hindsight, knowing what I know now, Snake Bite probably would have been a more appropriate  game for that game.  Snake Bite.  Help!  I'm here.  The doctor's here.  Wow.  What a sick, twisted little boy.  That's classic.  So going back to the whole sex thing and finding things out as a kid, my sister hates when  I tell this story, but it's the truth. 
[04:13:00]  I'm from a big family, and we love TV like you, you know, Ant?  Sure.  Always watching the Brady Bunch and all that crap on TV, and we're all sitting there one  night, you know, watching something.  All of us are downstairs, mom and dad and my brothers and my other sister, right?  And all of a sudden, there's screaming coming from upstairs.  My sister's screaming.  You know this story?  They're screaming her head off.  I'm like, what the F is wrong with my sister, you know?  And all of a sudden, she goes, Mom!  I'm bleeding!  Oh, no.  Had no idea what that was.  How old was she? 
[04:13:30]  I don't know.  And had no clue?  Oh, Jesus.  You know, you've got to let the girls in on that little secret that that's going to happen.  Yeah, that might be something you might want to pass a note when they're a lot younger.  Like, someday, blood is going to flow from there.  It's going to look like you're being murdered.  Don't worry about it.  We'll talk about it when it happens.  And guys will ignore you for a week.  I thought they should tell every little girl that.  You're going to be a real bitch on wheels, and guys won't talk to you.  You may feel guilty about your privates, but why don't they start bleeding profusely? 
[04:14:00]  And since it's the 70s, here's a belt with some snaps and pads and a strap on a ditey, a diaper.  Girls nowadays got it knocked.  I remember being a kid, and you ever discover one in the garbage pail in the bathroom?  I remember doing that.  I walked into the bathroom.  And, you know, parents, because my mother didn't do this, hide the big rolled-up wad of toilet paper. 
[04:14:30]  Because as a curious kid, if you look in the garbage, and the band is disgusted, you look in the garbage in the bathroom and see a big wadded-up toilet paper, not crumpled up, but rolled, you're going to think, oh, there's a present in there or something.  It's wrapped up so nicely.  No, I wouldn't think that.  What would you think?  Nothing.  I wouldn't look in the garbage for a wrapped-up present.  Okay, Monster Rain.  Yeah, Monster Rain.  Relax.  You would do that.  I'm not saying I wouldn't have looked in my friend's shorts for a gift, but I certainly wouldn't have.  Because it wasn't crumpled like you had blown your nose and thrown it in there. 
[04:15:00]  It was wrapped up.  So I unraveled it, and it was like, you know, it was a, you kind of pull on it, and it unravels like a magician trick.  And you're like, ooh, ooh, what do we have here?  And I'm like, what do we got here?  There's something in here.  And then what came out was, yeah, I used Kotex, just, you know, covered.  And, yeah, and I was like, oh, my God, what's that?  And I had to ask my mother.  I go, what, why is there something with blood on it in there? 
[04:15:30]  And she just said, oh, shut up and sent me away.  Didn't even discuss with me.  Thank God.  Probably better if she didn't, yeah.  Thank God.  I learned that.  But you know something?  How many years later is it?  And I still remember that traumatic moment.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  This guy's claiming he played Monster Rain with you.  It's probably a joke.  Mudgy?  Fudgy.  Fudgy?  Fudgy, yeah.  Fudgy, Jesus.  Hi, Fudgy.  See, Jim.  You figured out what that other hole's for, huh? 
[04:16:00]  Don't you remember what we used to do, Jim?  You used to take that big, fat pencil, and we used to put Elmer's glue on it and shove it in our ass and try writing on the wall?  No?  That sounds like a fun thing.  No, I think what he gave it away is I would have used rubber cement.  Always easier on the buttocks.  All right, well, the guy's trying to do a bit.  I had another.  Oh, man, I just forgot this.  Oh, my God, I can't hang up the.  There you go.  All right, hold on.  It might be my fault.  He was ready to unload.  My bad.  What did you forget, Jimmy? 
[04:16:30]  What were you talking about?  I don't know.  I shouldn't have gone to the phones.  I just wrecked it.  Talking about the periods?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the worst thing I ever found.  This was in the teenage years.  This has nothing to do with it.  I found a decapitated head.  No, that would have been funny.  In your trunk?  In your apartment?  A loaded, I lived with my parents, a loaded condom in the toilet.  Was it Pops?  Well, who else was it?  Well, you never know.  Yeah, it was my parents.  I guess they didn't want, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, I was 17.  I've seen the, uh.  They didn't want any more meaty disasters?  Yeah, I guess they saw a failure they were raising. 
[04:17:00]  And they're like, quick, just put latex on it.  This all started because of his scars, by the way.  Yeah, Jim has, uh, like a road map on his, um, on his arms.  He was a cutter because he played Monster Rain.  No, the Monster Rain was always fun.  This was latex.  Yeah, no, Jim, uh, Jim, did you try to end it, though?  Yes and no.  More, it was more of an attention-seeking, uh.  That's an attention-getter.  That is an attention-getter.  Yeah, I believe when you, uh, you slice your wrist, it's just an attention-getter.  Most times, yeah.  I'd say so.  There's so many other ways to do yourself in. 
[04:17:30]  I think you're right.  I think you're right.  It was like, the one time I did it was really brutal.  And the people that died from that, they're like, hello, you know, and they just run out  of time.  But in general, they want to be found and, you know, and then, and then nurtured back  to, back to health.  Just want to be loved.  You know, if you're going to do it, there's so many other ways to go, man.  I knocked on my parents' door.  One of them I did was really bad.  Like, right, I actually want to need, like, 18 stitches.  New Year's Eve, 85, going into 86, and I'm like, uh-oh, this is a bad one.  That was a good year.  Good way to start the year.  Yeah, positive note. 
[04:18:00]  That was the year that I was in rehab when the Challenger looked.  But you have, like, I don't know, four or five on one arm alone, I think.  And then he tried to go, he tried to go long ways down the vein once.  No, that was, no, that's in the back.  That wasn't a suicide.  That was just anger.  Oh, okay.  That wasn't a suicide.  That's a brutal one on the one.  Yeah, that one and that one I did on the same day.  Oh, God.  But then he showed me the jugular one one day.  Are you sure you saw the jugular?  I don't even think you saw my jugular.  You showed me one.  I think it's a slight scar or something.  Unless I'm remembering something.  I don't know.  Unless you remember me telling you.  But you actually had the razor up here and you just couldn't go through with it? 
[04:18:30]  No, it was obviously just a swipe.  Of course I couldn't go through with it.  But did you actually slice a little bit?  Yeah, it was in the woods I did that.  I just took a box cutter and went, wow.  Oh, gosh.  But I don't think you can see that anymore.  I think you're remembering, you might have seen something that might have been a, something  that happened recently.  I remember you told me the story.  Okay, yeah, because I don't think I still have a story.  And we weren't really laughing about that one.  Opie and Anthony's Best Bits.  Best audio sent in by a listener.  Are you kidding me?

[04:26:00]  Yeah, that friggin' son of a bitch Seinfeld douchebag.  Would you like to tell us the story?  Yeah, I feel like I'm on The Tonight Show right now.  Hey, Johnny.  Norton's Ed.  I don't want to be Ed.  I want to be Doc.  Take one up the keister.  Is he gay?  He always seemed a little flamboyant.  Seemed a little Noah-like.  Remember when he was filming Comedian? 
[04:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he was.  That son of a bitch was coming down with this little camera crew, and I never talked to  him.  I never said nothing to him.  I never say nothing to famous people when they come down there.  And there's certain comedians that don't know.  You're talking about the Comedy Cellar, by the way, where most of that movie Comedian was  filmed.  Yes.  Thank you.  Where all the big-time New York comics hang out when they're not on the road.  Right.  All right.  There you go.  Sorry.  Thanks.  So, this son of a bitch comes down. 
[04:27:00]  I never said nothing to him.  I just, you know, some comedians kiss their asses, you know.  Yeah.  Especially, he was filming, so there were certain comedians, Godfrey, that were just, you  know, sticking their faces in.  And I never said nothing to him.  One night, he says something to me.  I say something back.  I feel like we build up a rapport.  Rapport.  You know what I mean?  Like, it was organic.  Excuse me?  Yeah.  What's the code?  Because there's a door code to get down. 
[04:27:30]  Is this seat taken?  Well, you know, it was kind of like a little conversation we had.  Yeah.  So, the next day...  What was it about, Bob?  Was it something like...  All right.  So, it wasn't that much of a conversation, but it was enough for me to maybe say hi to  him again.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And he said...  Did he ask why you were looking at that midget and crying?  Hey, is that the first time he's done it?  Yeah.  Oh!  All right.  What is that? 
[04:28:00]  Oh, I'll never live that down.  No, you won't.  And you wonder why I fuck sinks.  So, I went and I did this gig up in Buffalo two days later.  The worst gig of my life, I have to hire my own driver to pick me up to drive me to the  gig.  This guy picks me up in a van.  One of those, you know, one of those, you know, cool vans with the captain seats and the  TV and the, you know, VCR. 
[04:28:30]  Nice.  So, he's got every Seinfeld episode ever, ever, ever.  And he's got headphones on.  And he's not watching and he's listening to them.  Jesus.  This guy's a Seinfeld freak.  So, we go, we're driving to the gig.  He's telling me about Seinfeld.  He finds out I'm a comedian.  He starts calling me Jerry.  Oh, jeez.  I took him out to, we went to lunch, you know, because we had like an hour to kill. 
[04:29:00]  Yeah.  So, the whole time he's telling me about, you know, his family and he's, you know, he's  like Jerry.  And I'm like Bob.  He's like, oh, I know, but I just really like Jerry.  So, I'm like, okay, call me Jerry.  Oh, my God.  That's weird.  Did he ask you to listen to an audio cassette of his stand-up and put you on his show?  Jerry.  Oh, Jerry.  So, this guy, this guy asked me for an autograph.  But, you know, I was like, you know what?  I might be able to get you one.  Because I just talked to him the other night for the first time, me and my new buddy. 
[04:29:30]  So, then I go to do this gig.  It's outside, after a band, in the rain, in the afternoon, next to a skydiving simulator,  at a beer fest.  So, how was the gig?  It was all right.  It wasn't that bad.  I pulled it off.  You pulled it off.  So, this gig was hell.  So, I go back to New York.  I met this guy. 
[04:30:00]  I mean, I lived this Seinfeld episode.  Yeah.  This guy, the whole gig with the thing and the flight simulator.  I can't wait to see Jerry and tell him the gig, you know, tell him about the gig.  So, the first time we talked, we made a bet.  I was making bets, and he jumped in on the bet.  So, I owed him a buck because he won the bet.  That's why that was our conversation.  Oh, okay.  So, he's on stage.  Do you remember what the bet was?  Yeah, it was if Gretzky was on the team when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup. 
[04:30:30]  And, no, he wasn't.  All right.  And, so, he walks off stage, and I got my dollar out, and there's, like, a crowd of people going nuts.  He walks by me at the foot of the stairs in the cellar, and I go, here's your buck.  You won the bet.  And, he looks at me with, like, almost take that, you know, he could smell dog shit, but he doesn't know where it is.  Look.  And, he took the buck, which kind of annoyed me that he took the buck.  Of course.  And, he didn't say nuts. 
[04:31:00]  All right.  Don't worry about it.  He took it.  Yeah.  I go, but I got a story for you first.  He goes, you want your buck back?  So, in my head, I'm like, what a fucking dick.  And, he walks up two stairs, and he turns around, and he goes, I'll be upstairs in the back corner eating.  So, when you're done, come up, and we'll talk upstairs.  So, I go, all right, man.  I'll be up.  I'm doing my set.  Right after my set, I'll come up.  We'll sit. 
[04:31:30]  We'll talk.  He goes, not you.  He was talking to the lady next to me.  I was so, you understand, there was a crowd of people there.  The lady next to me looked at me like, I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  And, then, he just walked up the stairs.  How embarrassing.  Oh, for that split second, you're like, oh, my God, Jerry's inviting me up to his table. 
[04:32:00]  I'm going to hang.  And, then, not you.  Just the fact that I assumed that he would invite me from two sentences to sitting down and having food with the guys.  Right.  And, I'm like, yeah, I'll be right.  I said it so confident, too.  I was like, good.  I've got to do my set.  But, right when I'm done with my set, I'll be up and I'll join you.  And, then, we'll talk about stories.  I've got to do my craft.  Not you.  And, that Jew voice.  That, his just big, fat lips. 
[04:32:30]  Just not you.  That's a good story, man.  Oh, that rings through my head.  Oh, of course it does.  Not you.  It rings through my fucking head.  You know how embarrassing it is when you're walking down the street and someone waves and goes, hey.  And, you wave back and then you realize it's somebody behind you that they're waving at.  It's the worst feeling.  And, you're all embarrassed.  It's got to be that times a thousand.  It's Jerry Seinfeld. 
[04:33:00]  And, you're in front of people.  And, that is the worst.  When Colin told me that, I couldn't stop laughing and feeling bad for you.  I cried like you at a midget wedding.  Dude, I, let me tell you something.  I, in my head, in like a split second, I literally saw myself being on his new show.  See?  I'm the new Kramer and I was just a superstar.  For a split second, like.  Walking by Norton, Colin, just blowing him off.  Jerry's inviting me to his table. 
[04:33:30]  This is great.  All right.  I'll be, I'll be up right after I do my, uh, my set.  Not you.  I finally made it.  Like Jerry will tell people about Bob, like, oh, you got to sit and talk to this guy.  He's out of his mind.  He's crazy.  Yeah.  Bob, they've, um, they've offered me a show and, uh, I need a help.  Uh, I need a writer.  Yeah.  Just like, uh, Larry was on Seinfeld.  I'd like you to be on, uh, this new project I'm working on.  Yeah.  We need a professional, uh, person who knows about, uh, eating ass.  And, uh, all those.  And effing sinks and, uh. 
[04:34:00]  Maybe you can be the tear Nazi.  The tear Nazi.  People come in with a sad story and you just cry and they walk out of your establishment.  God forbid I show emotion to a little girl who can't touch her face.  Little girl?  She was a woman.  Just happened to be a two foot tall.  We finally got the audio of that.  We're going to play after the break, by the way.  Finally.  We've been looking for that audio for weeks.  All right, Bob, we're going to let you go.  We might call you back because I think we're going to play the midget audio as well today.  All right, guys.  I love all you guys. 
[04:34:30]  You're the best, Bob.  Not you.  Well.  See you, man.  Bye.  All right, there he goes, Bob Kelly.  How awful is this?  Is that just an embarrassing story?  That's great.  Like, he's looking up the stairs at Jerry, looking down at you.  He says, when you're done, come on up.  We'll eat and talk.  And for that split, because you know, as a comic, he's standing there going,  man, this is great.  Oh, my God.  What an in.  You know, if you're going to network with a comedian, Seinfeld's the guy that you want 
[04:35:00]  to network with.  The guy, you know, took stand-up comedy and turned it into what every stand-up comic wants.  The most successful sitcom in history, you know.  And there he is, ready to go.  All the fantasies rushing through Bob's head.  Oh, yeah, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to tell.  The friends he's going to tell.  He's thinking about the friends he's going to tell that he hung out with Jerry,  and he invited him up to his table.  And the comedians that will see him walking in.  Right.  Like, we're all walking in, and there's Bob at Seinfeld's table chatting, having some fun. 
[04:35:30]  Right, chatting away.  Jerry throwing his head back, laughing at Bob's banter.  Bob.  And Bob going, dude, I just can't do it.  I can't give you six weeks, Jerry.  I can't.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  And then in that split second, in that split second, not you.  Because the comedy show, when you walk out of the showroom, you can make a right to leave,  or the steps up to the left will take you up to the olive tree, and it's very cramped. 
[04:36:00]  Yeah.  And everybody, if Seinfeld was speaking, everybody is silently listening.  Of course.  Everyone heard it.  What a wonderfully horrible story.  Oh, dude, it's just awful.  Yeah, hi, this is Nathaniel, and this is where Robert Kelly fucks a sink, and you can tell  how enthusiastic I am about this bit by the tone of my voice.  It's ONA's best bits.  Yeah.  Mark from Virginia, what's up?  Hey, man, I got to defend little Jimmy. 
[04:36:30]  What's that, fella?  Hey, I got to defend little Jimmy, man.  You're the man.  Without you, man, it wouldn't be a great show.  ONA, you got a great show, man, but you got to keep little Jimmy in there.  Thank you.  We're keeping little Jimmy.  Well, Jimmy's not going anywhere.  I don't want to get fired.  We just want him to fart less, that's all.  Hey, man, he's got to relieve some pressure from somehow.  He can't just whip out his mule and do it right there in the show.  Thank you, sir.  That's exactly what, and I get very excited sometimes, and it just sneaks out.  I don't mean to ruin the show. 
[04:37:00]  There you go, man.  He pops...  You're my idol, little Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  He pops boners all the time.  So what?  Folios are good things.  Dude, but you have to show everyone.  He gets our attention, and he grabs onto it.  We're trying to enjoy the freaking 20-year-old stripper from L.A., and all of a sudden, we're  all like, whoa, what has he got?  And then we're looking at your hog again.  You don't have to look.  Well, when you're jumping up and down like you might have something...  I don't jump.  I just kind of point, and you guys choose to look.  I don't jump.  He definitely tries to get your attention. 
[04:37:30]  He lifts it over the edge of the console.  And rests it.  Grabs, pulls it sideways, and shakes it a little.  Yeah.  I want a little extension built around his area.  A mule hider?  Yes.  Like a sneeze guard for a...  Exactly.  A mule guard?  A mule guard?  Look, it's a perfect height where he can just plop it on the table.  I think it does.  He can raise it on there.  I do rub it against this thing.  It's perfect.  I'll have some of the Norton wiener.  You can't out-gay Norton, though.  No, it's not a gay thing when I do that.  I'm usually turned out by a woman. 
[04:38:00]  It's not like I'm just...  You can't.  He'll try to hug me or something.  I understand what Bob Kelly's saying, though.  Yeah.  You know, out-gay.  I mean, you like to try to get that reaction by doing something that would be perceived as gay.  No, I don't.  One time, I actually...  You know, he does gay things once in a while, and it freaks you out.  And one time, I was like, you know what?  I'm going to out-gay him.  And I actually...  You can't out-gay him.  I stuck my finger right near his butt, and he actually stopped and backed up, and my finger went in his asshole.  And I...  I just...  How many knuckles did he get in there? 
[04:38:30]  It was one and a half.  Yeah.  It was like a little shrimp.  I could actually bend my finger.  That did not happen.  He just stopped.  And then he went like this.  Ooh.  He tried to put his finger by my ass, and it's like, look, you're going to learn a lesson the hard way.  Why is your pants down at this point?  No, no, no.  My pants were on.  Easy, easy, Opie.  Why didn't you get a finger down?  We were just walking in the hallway of the apartment.  We were dressed.  I asked how many knuckles you took.  You took a knuckle and a half through the jeans?  I would actually take something real, enhance it, exaggerate it.  Therein lies the ha-ha.  Yeah, he didn't mean to put it in my ass.  I didn't mean I stuck my finger in his ass.  That would be gay, wouldn't it? 
[04:39:00]  He put it against my ass, and I just backed up against it to teach him who was boss.  He learned how to listen.  Well, you should have told me it was exaggerated humor.  We don't know.  I thought that's what humor was.  Not all the time.  Really?  What's the other type of humor?  Dude, we've all seen him naked, so it was quite possible that that actually happened.  I've seen him naked.  Don't look at me like I'm an alien.  That's an exaggeration, too.  I've never seen Jimmy naked.  There you go.  All right, show him your hug.  I don't want him.  No, I won't show him my hug.  I don't want to see Jimmy naked.  I love the face he gets when he gets ... I was actually with him one time, and he gets  this face. 
[04:39:30]  His eyes just open wide, and his head turns down, and his upper lip goes underneath his  back tooth, and he just looks like a little troll, and he just doesn't blink, like Christopher  Walken in a scene, and he just stares at the girl like, yeah.  Yeah, that's nasty.  Oh, he does.  It's just evil.  He is.  His little body.  All right.  You know, no one's really screening the calls today.  The behind-the-scenes people are very, very slow.  Everyone's tired today.  We're all tired.  Hello, who's this? 
[04:40:00]  Oh, that was good.  A hang-up.  I'm going to do it myself.  Hello, who's this?  Hello?  Hey.  Oh, it's ...  What?  Hey, Opie?  Yeah.  Oh, what's going on?  Hi, fella.  I was going to set up for, what did I learn, but it's a little too early.  Yeah.  I was going to hold on, hold for a while, but it's cool.  You were going to hope to hold for about 45 minutes?  I guess so.  I'll do one a little early.  For some reason, Jimmy Norton plays Monster Rain just fine, but today, a little sticky banana 
[04:40:30]  juice got his nerves up for some reason.  Yeah, that's true.  It is inconsistent, but it freaked me.  I didn't know what it was.  It was probably sitting in the deli or something, and God knows what those savages spill on their  fruit.  By the way, we did get a brand new Monster Rain song.  How many is that?  This is at least ...  Number four?  Oh, my God.  It's not ... It's ... It's ... It's ... It's bad.  Is it bad?  Listen.  We'll all judge.  All right.  Another Monster Rain song.  We weren't going to go to it, but ...  The guys are kind of asleep behind the scenes today, so ... 
[04:41:00]  That's right.  Look at them.  Look at them.  They're not even moving.  They all ... You know what it is?  They want to be punished.  They need discipline.  This damn Rent Boys thing has backfired.  Now everybody's fucking off, hoping to get a reading.  Steve records the thing in stereo.  We need the phone screened.  Isn't it obvious we're suffering here?  Yeah, we're tired, Ben.  Get fucking people on the phones.  I'm not even kidding anymore.  Get them on the phone, Ben.  No one is screening the calls, really.  It's like slow motion.  Get my mother back on the phone.  Have her do that ...  It's been the same.  We got six phone lines ringing. 
[04:41:30]  We got two guys that have been sitting, and it's nothing we want to go to.  It's boring shit.  Here's the Monster Rain song.  Tell me when to stop.  Let's give a listen.  It really is bad.  Let's listen along.  Oh, Neil Diamond.  Duncan Neil Diamond.  Love on the porch.  So far, so good. 
[04:42:00]  It's getting a little abstract, I think.  You took my heart, you took my soul, gave me a little tea, then played with my own. 
[04:42:30]  And since gone, but I gave Jimmy this smile.  A little rough.  We'll give it like 30 more seconds.  Big car.  First, the sky's a-talking, then Jimmy starts his talking. 
[04:43:00]  Suddenly, you're under the porch, hiding from the storm.  The fear makes him have you, then he wants to have you.  Nothing you can do or say.  Once he starts, you have to stay.  It's the Monster Rain. 
[04:43:30]  This guy's all over the place.  Did we end it?  End it?  Gave me what I need.  Yeah, he's breaking all the rules.  Gave me no choice.  He's breaking all the parody rules.  Yeah.  He's really singing.  Song parody rules are like, first of all, you've got to be able to hear what you're saying.  There's a couple of lines there that are a little...  Muffled.  Yeah, you couldn't really hear it.  Second one, you don't use that many of the lines from the real song.  Right.  The guy's using too many of the real words to the song. 
[04:44:00]  It's like a parody slash audition as a real singer.  Yeah, Neil Diamond cover band.  Well, it's dug out Doug.  Did you ever come up with...  He does a pretty good Neil Diamond.  I'll say.  Did you ever have a Monster Rain story?  Did you come up with one yet?  No.  You heard my story, right?  No, what was yours?  Oh, you weren't listening the other day.  He had the marshmallow in the frat house.  Which people are saying is just as bad as the Monster Rain.  I was out in Arizona last week.  I missed the whole show.  It's one of those things where you're hazing for a fraternity, and one of the things you 
[04:44:30]  ought to do is pull the pants down, pick up a marshmallow with his ass, and drop it  on a little mock...  A rivalry fraternity house.  ...frat house.  And then no one ate it?  No.  No, you sick ass.  Come on.  But it's a room full of guys with their pants down.  Yeah.  It's a room full of guys with their pants down, picking up things with their buttholes.  Look who says that, the guy that put a finger in my ass.  Well, he didn't.  Well, I guess my cracky did.  No, you had your pants on. 
[04:45:00]  Yeah, but I felt the actual shrimp haul, the actual...  The separation.  Yeah, the separation.  I'm guessing there's a Bob Kelly story.  That bombs you?  I thought it was a little odd that frats do things like that and have guys in these  nude circumstances doing things.  Yeah, I think it's a little odd.  There's definitely a Bob Kelly story.  Yeah, there's definitely a Bob Kelly story.  Now, let me just get this straight.  Is it like just pure molestation?  Does it have to be a guy or can it be a girl or an aunt?  No, we all have girl stories.  How old would the boy be and how old would the aunt be? 
[04:45:30]  Oh, jeez.  What the hell is an aunt?  I don't like it either, but I'm just going with the story.  I'm from aunt.  It's an aunt.  Aunt.  What do you say, aunt?  Yeah, aunt.  If I say aunt, then he's going to go what?  And then it's going to be like a whole pack of things.  Who's on first?  Aunt, aunt.  Oh, marshmallows.  Listen.  My aunt, aunt.  What?  What?  What?  Aunt?  I've done a couple things.  Yeah.  I guess we were talking about things that could be looked at as, yeah.  A little gee.  A little gee. 
[04:46:00]  A little gee.  Well, I used to...  We got shards of glass.  You broke a CD and it just made shards.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, I'll be right.  That's what you get.  All right, relax.  I should settle down, huh?  Settle down.  Now, what do you got down?  Why don't you settle down?  Find a girl like Henry.  Tell us your gay story.  Well, it's not gay.  Only the good half.  It's not gay because it was young.  Settle down every night, ma?  It was young.  You were young.  Yeah.  Well, that's the whole monster ain't excuse Jimmy gives is it's not gay because he was 
[04:46:30]  young.  Well, it's true.  So, everybody, four out of five young boys have done stuff with their buddies' peepees  when they're young because you don't know what sex is yet.  And the fifth one watches.  That's what my therapist told me.  Really?  Yeah, that it's pretty natural.  Really?  So, when you were, how old were you and whatever?  So, I guess I'm not normal.  Oh, yeah, you are.  You're so normal, you probably have repressed it.  But there's a normal memory there.  I couldn't give you one, though.  It's going to come out someday.  I don't know.  I forgot all about the marshmallow story, so I guess we'll see. 
[04:47:00]  I'm sure there's more in there.  All right, go ahead.  How old were you?  How old was I?  I think I was, I had to be in first grade.  First grade.  First grade.  That's six.  Actually, yeah, it was before first grade.  My first sexual experience with a woman was in first grade with this chick, the blouse.  This local whore.  And she made me suck.  Whore?  Yeah, the blouse.  How old was she?  She was like, she had to be like 14.  Oh.  So, she was older and she took me in the bushes.  Yeah.  And made me suck on her tits.  And then she played with my little mushroom. 
[04:47:30]  Like, she just played with it.  Wow.  What a little whore.  I actually cried all night because I thought God was going to punish me.  And he was going to.  And he did.  What a good Catholic.  I remember me and my.  You cried all night because of that?  Well, you know, I was raised Catholic.  That's horrendous.  Of course.  And I didn't know she's touching me and I'm sucking on it.  She made me do this stuff.  I was molested.  You were molested.  And then I went home that night and I was just crying in my bed, just crying, praying for God.  Please forgive me. 
[04:48:00]  I'm sorry.  This is bad.  Are you kidding?  And my mother actually came up.  She was like, honey, what's wrong?  I was like, nothing.  I'm just, you know, I had a bad dream.  And I just cried all night.  I just felt bad.  And that is more porn.  Thank you, man.  And that is more porn.  I just had to, you know, make this story a little more fun.  Yeah.  Porn, porn, porn.  All right.  So you're crying in bed.  Let Dirty Boy finish his story.  Well, you know, it's funny.  It's like a week later.  I actually.  You do understand it was your fault.  It was my fault.  Yeah. 
[04:48:30]  Why?  It was your fault.  She took me into the bush and made me.  Looking all sexy.  What are you expecting to parade that little hairless jewel around?  Who wouldn't touch it for Pete's sake?  She used to take me into Tufts University.  And after that, I kind of got into it.  And I used to grab my friend, Matthew.  We used to go up into the attic of Tufts University.  And just each one of us would.  She was fat.  Just fat and huge stitch.  And each one of us would just suck on a tit.  Wow.  Like little babies.  Like little. 
[04:49:00]  You were little babies.  Yeah.  It was just this hot, sweaty attic.  And this fat chick.  And she was just sweating.  And me and him would just both grab one of our huge tits and just suck on a foot.  And was she getting pleasure out of this?  Was she moaning or something?  No, not really.  She would just sit there.  Sometimes she'd smoke during it.  Sometimes.  I swear to God.  She'd just light up a cigarette.  It was weird.  Like she would just do it with everybody.  My first three chicks were just fat white chicks.  The Blouse, Kimba, and some other chick.  I don't remember her name.  Kimba.  Kimba, yeah.  She would just. 
[04:49:30]  Where's the guy thing come in?  Oh, when I was before.  No, you know when I was after that.  He's trying to tell chick stories.  And you're like, where's the guy stuff?  Yeah.  I kind of like the DeBlau story.  Yeah, thanks, man.  That was nice.  I mean, Ope.  Sorry.  Nice talking to you.  Wanted to, you know, keep you on track.  All right.  Well, you know what happened is that me and my friend, we would go over to, he would come  over to my house because both of my parents worked.  And my sister would be out.  So we'd just lie on the couch.  Uh-oh.  It's already down.  And, uh.  Oh, boy.  Buckle up.  Buckle up.  This is.  Comes another monster rain. 
[04:50:00]  This is way beyond monster rain.  I can sense it.  I don't know why you call it monster rain.  Why don't you just call it sucking each other's cocks and being friends?  Well, the more I look at it, the more I realize that there probably was no such thing  as monster rain.  I've come to that conclusion.  Oh, really?  You're backing out of stuff now?  What are you saying?  No.  I didn't know that you guys grew up together.  No, easy.  What I was saying was.  You know me.  If me and him were buddies when we were a kid, we'd have some.  Dude, remember that time I banged you in your ass?  All right.  All right.  Listen.  We wouldn't have a story like that.  That wasn't gay, though.  I talked to my therapist. 
[04:50:30]  That's not gay.  We just didn't know any better.  We're friends, you know?  No.  All right.  So.  So you and your friend would lie on the couch.  We'd lie on the couch.  Just before I, you know.  How old was he?  Uh, 13.  How old were you?  No, I'm joking.  He was, uh.  Ah, shit.  We had to be.  We had to be.  How old were you in fifth grade?  How old were you in fifth grade?  11.  I don't know.  It depends what color you are.  No, not 11.  11?  No, it wasn't 11.  What color are you?  You were 11 years old.  Hang on.  I didn't even hear that.  That's so bad.  That's good.  You were 11.  I wasn't 11. 
[04:51:00]  Opie, it's not 11, because I was in.  You graduate sixth grade.  You're 12 years old, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you're 11 in fifth grade.  It must have been.  You were 11.  Fourth grade.  11.  I wasn't 11, because I started drinking at 11.  10 or 11.  And I wasn't drinking then.  Of course you started drinking.  This is before you started drinking in the bottles.  This is my first addiction.  Then I moved on to booze.  So what happened when you were almost a teenager?  You were laying on the couch.  You lie on the couch.  You just lie there.  And this is when, remember when you first started jerking off, you used Vaseline? 
[04:51:30]  Yes.  Remember like petroleum jelly?  Sure.  You would like waterproof your dick for like three days.  Just jump in the shower to wash it off, and it would just beat up.  Just looking for anything slippery at that age.  Didn't matter.  Running around like a monkey.  Just looking, what?  Pancake batter?  I don't care.  Whatever works.  I jerked off with anything.  Anything.  Anything.  I used to jerk off with the Juergens, and I'd fuck the sink.  You ever fuck the sink?  I can't say I've ever done that.  If you ever want to jerk off, and it feels like you're fucking somebody, you get on, 
[04:52:00]  you know the big long sinks in the bathroom, the counter?  Yeah.  Right?  You have to have, you can't have like a pedestal sink.  How small is your dick?  Listen to me.  It's a sink.  Wait, it's the way you pull the little thing out that seals your drain up?  No.  No, you don't fuck the sink sink.  Well, you lie on the counter.  It has to be a counter with the sink in the middle.  Oh, oh.  You lie down, and you put your hand here.  It's almost like a ditch.  It's a ditch, and you put your hand on the edge, you lube up your hand, and you push your  hand in, and then your hand is stationary.  And it all goes in the sink. 
[04:52:30]  And you get the fuck, and then it goes right in the sink.  It's unbelievable.  You are a genius.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  It really feels like you're fucking somebody.  I swear to God.  I'm not going to be able to look at a sink ever again.  No.  That is brilliant, because there's no cleanup.  You're getting, you're able to use your whole body in it.  You open your eyes, and you're looking right at yourself in the mirror.  How fucking creepy is that?  It's a fat, bald chick I'm fucking.  I got caught in rehab.  When I went to rehab, I got caught fucking the sink. 
[04:53:00]  I used to fuck the sink during our group sessions, because I know everybody was in the group.  So one time, I guess, somebody snapped in group, and they had to end group early.  And I'm in the bathroom fucking the sink, and there was like a crack in the door.  And all of a sudden, I just hear giggling, and all 10 guys from my rehab house were in  there.  They were just watching me fuck the sink.  It was just awful.  So you still do that?  I haven't done it, because I have a pedestal sink now.  You can't do that.  Yeah, you can't do that.  I'm too fat to balance myself on a pedestal sink. 
[04:53:30]  But yeah, I've done it.  I've done it in hotel rooms.  You ever go into hotels?  You have to go into cheesy hotels, but the suite in a cheesy hotel always has that big,  long counter with one sink, a little sink in the middle.  Perfect.  Just jump up on top.  You lube your hand up.  Don't lube your dick up.  No?  No, because you want to lube just the inside of your hand.  Put it on there.  And then when you push it in, it's like cracking the seal of a real pussy.  What the hell is going on?  You want a little resistance.  You want a little resistance, because it cracks it, and you're like, oh. 
[04:54:00]  And it feels like you're cracking the seal of a stink wrinkle just as it's going in.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  Right now, there's a sink in therapy somewhere.  I just wanted to clean people and help and wash them.  And this fat kid would climb on and put a stinking in my face.  Well, I was in the bathroom where I usually am, and the lights came on.  These are great distractions.  So, what happened with the guy on the couch?  Yeah, it's true.  So, you were almost a teenager naked with another boy. 
[04:54:30]  And you pretended...  There's no naked, yes.  Wait a minute, Ovi.  I love...  You are such a fucking magician.  You said fifth grade.  You said almost a teenager.  I know, but throw the teen out.  I'm still a young boy.  You're still young.  You're a master at that, and I know what you're doing.  Dude, fifth grade.  Because all these...  The grade is 11.  Could be 11 and a half.  That's close to a teenager.  All these truck drivers are hearing it's teenager, boy, man.  There you go.  So, I played Monster Rain, and you played Use My Mouth Like a Sink.  All right, go ahead.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Well, I...  I would... 
[04:55:00]  We'd just lie on the couch.  Mommy's gone for the day.  Gone for the day, and we'd lie on the couch, and we'd pull each other's pants down, and  then, like, he would jerk off, and I would jerk off with the Vaseline.  But then...  Oh, God.  But then...  Oh, God.  Go ahead.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  It's not gay, because you're too young to know.  Yeah, you're too young to know what's going on.  Meanwhile, you got the 3D player working.  Let me tell you something.  I've never paid $250 to, you know, repeat this while I was older. 
[04:55:30]  It's never happened.  I, uh...  Nothing.  Good.  Oh, my God.  No, we got it.  Nice talking to you.  I, uh...  So, we would jerk off, and after a while, it's like...  It's like when you're in a pool, and you, you know, you play one game, and it's like,  ah, what's...  You start just making up anything.  We're gonna, you know, duck paint nanner and throw in the pool, and whoever...  If she drowns, you lose.  If you save her, you win.  I'm bored with Marco Polo, so...  Yeah, exactly.  Marco Polo.  So, that was it. 
[04:56:00]  There it is.  So, uh...  Yeah.  So, you're getting bored...  So, you're getting bored just cranking it with each other, or in front of each other.  Well, you get bored, you're just cranking it out, and you were so young, nothing's coming  out.  You're kind of pretending.  You know what I mean?  You ever have...  Oh, okay.  That's, that's, that's gonna be the savior right there.  Yeah, yeah.  That's gonna pull you out of this.  Oh, I'm just saying, this is what annoyed me, is that my friend was older than me, so  he could actually blow a load, and I remember being so self-conscious, and one time I got  a marshmallow, and I mushed it up in my hand, and I put, like, little daubs, so I was like, 
[04:56:30]  I came too, because, uh...  Really?  Well, I just, I was so...  Oh, man.  Dude, you're now starting to scare me.  What, dude?  You're a freak.  I just wanted to, I wanted to blow a load.  It's like, you want to be part of the group.  You didn't get that marshmallow from a frat house, did you?  Did it look like it had been roasted over a fire for five seconds?  You have a blonde, bang, gorgeous guy actually pulled up and gave me a marshmallow.  Did it? 
[04:57:00]  Got it.  Oh, so, so, uh...  You faked it.  No, I didn't fake it.  I think by this time I could actually...  No, I couldn't.  You put the marshmallow on it.  All right, listen.  How long were you guys doing this?  Yeah, how many years?  How many years?  Well, he would come over every once in a while.  Well, I was bummed when he left for college.  He still dropped by.  We got to the game.  Can I just say something, though?  Said too much.  I see him every once in a while.  No.  I'm so open with it.  I've talked about it.  I remember when I went to rehab, the guy brought me in.  This guy brought me in. 
[04:57:30]  He goes, tell me the worst thing you've never told anybody.  And I was like, this is the story I told him.  I go, I've never...  This is what I carry around with me.  Right.  My whole life that makes me feel like a piece of shit.  And he goes, everybody's done that.  And he goes, I've done it.  And he goes, go get Mark, John, and Billy in here.  And they all come in.  Hey, you ever jerk off with your friend?  You ever touch your friend's cock when you were young?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See?  He goes, it's not that bad.  Everybody does that.  And I was like, hey, you guys, you know.  Then we all went and jerked each other off.  No, I'm joking.  So you got bored with Marco Polo. 
[04:58:00]  Stop going off track here.  Good point, Ope.  Good point.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Keeping him on track.  Where do you keep him focused?  And that's why you're here, Ope.  That's why I'm a radio genius.  You are.  What happened now?  You're a little bored.  So you get a little bored.  And I felt weird, too, because I was definitely the bottom.  Oh, okay.  All right.  What the hell?  You were more of the feminine one in this relationship?  Faking it to keep him happy?  Not feminine.  It was more like...  He was the take charge kind of guy.  I was younger.  I was the younger kid, so I was... 
[04:58:30]  All right.  I was the learner.  He was the teacher.  So what then happened?  So then he would be like, why don't you grab mine and play with mine?  Ah, there you go.  So I would grab it, but I grabbed it like this.  Oh, because doing it upside down doesn't make it gay.  No, because I'm not at all.  You know, so I feel like that's the way men jerk off other men.  I was going to do it, but I didn't really want to commit, so I did it this way.  You know what I mean, right, guys?  Thumb and forefinger against the body.  No, it's not that.  That keeps it away from God.  It's just that I'm dyslexic, so I went on his. 
[04:59:00]  I went upside down.  Yeah, upside down.  No, I just didn't know how to grab another man.  I never grabbed, so I knew how to grab mine, but it was like, how do I grab it?  He's like, no, do it this way.  Yeah, I guess you would grab it the same way, right?  You know what's so funny, too, is that he had a retarded baby brother, and his brother came in.  Oh, no.  Oh, what a mess that month.  No, no, no, he didn't come in while we were doing this.  He came in at like, Jesus.  You know after this session, you're going to leave us a check, right?  A check for what? 
[04:59:30]  The therapy.  Getting this off your chest.  Getting this off your chest.  Well, he, his little brother.  Taking over the whole show.  His little brother came in, and he had a huge, just a retard talk.  Well, we've talked about that.  All retards have huge retarded eyes.  And he had pubes, and he was younger than me.  I had no pubes, and I had this.  The internet is for porn.  Thank you, Ant.  Keep it fun, Ant.  Keep it fun.  Me up all night, hugging me.  Porn to porn.  Porn.  Porn.  Yes, Bob.  So, anyways, he actually, he actually, he goes, put it in your mouth. 
[05:00:00]  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  Oh, boy.  The retard dick?  No, not the retard dick.  I couldn't fit that in my mouth.  Oh, we've gotten to that point.  So, anyways, I, I put it in.  How many chapters?  Huh?  How many chapters to this story?  Oh, no.  And what chapter are we up to?  You didn't.  You didn't.  What happened?  You must have known that that was much more wrong than just cranking.  I swear to God.  In front of each other.  I, I swear to God, I didn't.  I was too young. 
[05:00:30]  I didn't know.  No, I know.  So, what happened?  He said, put it in my mouth, and you did.  I put it in, and it tasted like, it was like, just, it didn't, it just, like,  feet.  Tasted like feet?  Yeah, like, it just tasted, you ever suck your toes when you're a kid, like, bite your  toenails?  No, I didn't.  You never bit your toenails?  I do constantly, but I never compared that to a cock.  Oh, my God.  You're telling us what?  Well, you didn't, you didn't bite the dickhead, did you?  Like, no.  No.  I just remember it was like, it was spongy.  It's like, like a, a spongy foot. 
[05:01:00]  He's talking, he's telling what it feels like of another man's dick in his mouth.  It's not a man, it's a, it's a, it's a, it doesn't make it any better when I say it's  a kid.  You're almost 13.  Yeah.  Um, yeah, he had, did he have hair?  I wouldn't let him do it to me, though, because he had braces and it scared me.  All right, so at least you were old enough to make the pain association.  Give me old payback.  Well, you know what?  It's, it's not gay, guys.  It's not gay.  It's just, listen to me.  No, we believe you.  Guys, look at me in the eye.  I can't.  I can't.  Everybody's looking at the wall and it's making me feel bad. 
[05:01:30]  You have, uh, yeah, you're on your own.  No, I can't even look at you.  Opie, look at me.  No.  I'm looking for a, Anthony, look at me.  Now, you're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch and I'd bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  We just want this to go away now.  Yes, I am gay.  Well, I actually, can I tell you about the retard story?  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  You have to.  I, uh, can I just recover?  This, I used to have this, this.  What?  She wasn't retarded.  She was like that dumb.  No, we don't want to hear it.  No, no, no.  Yeah, she's. 
[05:02:00]  Yeah, but she was retarded.  You're stupid.  She was retarded, though.  Dad!  Don't laugh at me!  Stop laughing at me!  You stop laughing at me!  I'm not fucking dead!  Don't laugh at me!  Audio from the Kelly's basement.  She used to follow me home every day, and one day, I actually... 
[05:02:30]  You didn't have sex with a retard.  Well, one day.  There's actually two stories.  I brought her home.  She brought me home.  I mean, I brought her home.  She followed me home.  Here's how we...  This is where we get the gay out of the show, Anthony.  Yeah.  Sex with retards.  Only on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Take a promo out of that.  She used to follow me home.  I think it was seventh grade.  So one time, I let her come home with me, because my mom was out.  Was she...  How retarded was she?  Was she a slow girl in school, or was she like...  She was the fat kid.  The fat girl with the greasy hair and the straight bangs.  I was going to say, the Pete Rose haircut? 
[05:03:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Pretty retarded.  But she wasn't, like her body...  She wasn't mongoloid?  She had like a big, like a silverback gorilla forehead, like it's long, but short and angled.  I gotcha.  And she had like...  But not Down syndrome.  ...little volcano tits.  You know what I mean?  A fat gut, but just volcano tits.  How old were you?  I was in seventh grade, so...  You were 13.  13.  Now you're officially a teenager.  You moved on from sucking men off to having sex with retards.  And you wonder why you're in therapy.  Trying to cleanse the palate, literally speaking. 
[05:03:30]  When did you finally get up to hot chicks?  Last year?  No.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Actually, around 20.  20.  When I got sober, I finally got...  I was like, great.  This is great.  The sober thing really...  Why is every comedian recovering something?  Because they have experiences like this that you've got to drink away.  Exactly.  Exactly.  The second you were sober, before you got sober.  Yeah.  I mean, like before you got a drink that day.  Yeah.  Would these things just creep in and you were like, oh my god, I need a drink so bad?  I used to hang out with these guys.  They were all from South Medford, Italian, mafia type guys, all kick ass. 
[05:04:00]  And I would be around them all the time and have these thoughts that would enter my head.  And I would get so uncomfortable, it almost came out.  If they only knew, they would throw me out of this little...  Oh, I'd be killed.  They'd beat the hell out of me.  All right, so you're 13.  She's 7?  No, no, no, no.  She's my age.  You're a friggin' lunatic.  Stop enhancing the story.  That's why there was a question mark.  I can't believe he can make the stories worse, but he is.  There was a question mark. 
[05:04:30]  Was she 7?  I'm getting confused here.  She's older.  Oh, 7th grade.  She had the mental capacity of a 7-year-old.  You're sick F.  Yeah, that's true.  Did she talk all weird?  She didn't.  You're stupid!  Was it like that?  Yeah, she was like that a little bit.  So I took her back to my house.  You know, there's a guy in Ohio checking in, and I agree with him.  The show is two weeks away from a guy doing the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  No!  Dude, this has to end. 
[05:05:00]  I'm really getting pissed off about this.  It's just, you know what it is?  It's therapy sessions.  Why does all of Jimmy's friends have to come in and admit their gay experiences?  I don't know.  We did kind of pull it out of him.  You sat there.  Dude, you started off like...  Unfortunately, my friend didn't.  You started off when we...  Left it right in his mouth.  I tried to sidetrack with pussy eight times.  Yeah.  And you kept going, all right, get back to the...  We started off with one of the hottest girls we've ever had on the show.  From me?  We wanted to bow to you, and now we want to shun you, man.  Now you realize what would happen if you bowed to him. 
[05:05:30]  I fucked the sink.  Oh, my God.  Can we get past the sex with retard thing?  No, the retard is a girl.  She's a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Sure she is.  She's just a little retarded, and she claps like this.  With her wrists.  So I took her in the basement.  I made her jerk me off with that old, really harsh soap with the little grains of...  Lava?  Yeah, lava soap.  They wash oil off your hands.  You love punishing yourself.  Yeah, it's got granules in it.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  Ow.  She's jerking me off, but she's just... 
[05:06:00]  I cleaned off with a Brillo pad.  She kept going, is this how I do it?  Is this okay?  Is this okay?  It hurts my hand.  Asking those same questions you were asking just a year prior.  Turn your hand over.  You're stupid.  Easier fucking a sink.  So I looked up in the window in the basement, and I saw my mother's car pull up.  Uh-oh.  So I said, wait here, wait here, and I just ran upstairs, and my mother came home with  my aunt, and I'm talking to her, and I'm so nervous, and then I'm sitting on the couch 
[05:06:30]  watching TV, but I fell asleep.  Oh, no.  Around four hours later, I woke up.  It was dark out, and I was like, oh, my God.  I forgot all about her in the basement.  I ran around the back, and you know those tornado doors, like the angled doors for the  cellar, the basement doors?  I opened it up, and this poor retarded girl was just sitting there shivering.  She still had soap on her hand, the fucking gookie soap, and she's shitting there shivering  like, I gotta go home.  I was supposed to be home a long time ago. 
[05:07:00]  I gotta go home.  All right, retard, finish the job first, and then you can go.  Did you make her finish?  No, I didn't make her finish, but another time I saw her, my friend actually held a rock  over her head until she jerked both of us off.  All right.  I like that.  Oh, my God, you're a criminal.  Not me.  It was my friend.  You're an accomplice.  No, I'm not.  I told her not to do it.  No, it's not.  It's a retarded girl.  She thought it was fun.  She thought it was to hold the rock over the head game.  Hey, we want to thank Bob Kelly for stopping on by today.  Why didn't you do that? 
[05:07:30]  Why didn't you spend all of me loving me?  Why didn't you do that?  You can hear more.  Why didn't you spend all of me loving me?  Put the rock down.  Please, put the rock down.  Bob, where could people hear more gay stories?  It's not gay open.  Will you stop that?  We'll have you at the Stress Factory.  You can go to robertkelleylive.com.

[05:08:00]  What?  I want to know if the guy made you do it by going, he puts the cock in his mouth.  He does this when it's told.  He does this when it's told.  He does this when it's told.  It's not gay if you do it thumb and forefinger first.  You've heard the Silence of the Lambs song, right?  Yes, it's very funny.  We love that one.  It's O.B.  And Anthony's Best Sandwiches.

Last one we dumped.  Surface too soon.  Fine.  I'll get the shovels and the lime.  Uh, let's use your car.  I just had mine washed.

[05:10:30]  Paradise.  Remember that show, guys?  Sure.  Yup.  All right.  Well, Bill Burr thought it was a very funny show because Tara Reid sounds pretty unintelligent  on it.  So we cut it up, played it for everybody, and Bill and Ant had a great time doing their  Tara Reid impressions.  I believe these are ONA's best bits.  One of them.  Hey, you know what we haven't talked about yet?  What?  What we were talking about in the office?  About Tara Reid and all that?  All right.  Her show, uh, Terrible. 
[05:11:00]  What is it called?  Tara Dice.  Tara Dice?  Terrifying.  Oh, it's so bad.  It's amazing.  It's the old Wild On show they used to do on E.  Same thing, where they send her around.  But now Tara Reid, Wild On E, or whatever.  Yeah, and Brooke Burke used to talk all the time, you know, and do, like, the whole segments,  and she's so bad.  They have, like, 17 montages, and they'll just come to her, you know, this is where life  began, and she's like, wow, you guys, that's amazing, that's crazy, this is insane. 
[05:11:30]  I took a peek the other day, I couldn't believe how awful she looked.  And she won't do anything, either.  This is like Tara saying, no, that's crazy, you guys.  Yeah, she's in, like, these faraway places, and she's supposed to participate in some activities,  and she doesn't?  No, she won't.  The two episodes I've seen, anything that they're doing, she was supposed to run with  the bulls.  No.  No.  I was gonna, and then I was just like, I'm not gonna. 
[05:12:00]  I was just like, how are you building a show around this?  Oh, God.  And then she'll laugh, like, oh.  Camel unfilters.  Yeah, she's known for just smoking like crazy.  And she had that, that, um, what, how do they, what do they call that voice when they  want it to sound like it's something sexy?  Oh, that smoky voice?  Yeah, the me more description.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a way you put it, uh, that sounds sexy.  And maybe when, you know, a few years back, when she was doing those American Pie movies, 
[05:12:30]  I guess, it was kind of cute.  Now, it's just reached a point where it, it really reminds me of Lucille Ball in her final  years when she used to do Carson.  Remember you watch I Love Lucy as a kid, and she was like, Ricky, uh, we gotta have  Mrs. Trumbull watch Little Ricky, and I'll meet you at the club later.  And that was Lucy.  And then, like, six years later, six years go by, she's on a talk show. 
[05:13:00]  Well, you know, me and Viv, when we invented the sitcom, we, uh, we, uh, never really got  along with Bill Frawley.  When me and Desi started Desilu Studios.  Like, what happened to her voice?  She'd be on those talk shows with a drink and a cigarette.  The drink clinking.  No problem.  Clink, clink.  Oh, Johnny.  Just drinking and smoking.  That is funny.  And, uh, that's definitely the road Tara Reid has taken. 
[05:13:30]  She's not going to be able to talk.  The emphysema.  Yeah, they all wound up getting it back then.  Uh, she died of it.  Ricky, I remember seeing, um, Desi Arnaz on a Saturday Night Live episode.  Like, right before he died.  Yeah.  He, uh, he was on.  I don't know.  Did he host it?  I think he was a host.  And, uh, just ravaged by the sea.  The big, uh, casino.  Got his lungs.  Because they were always smoking. 
[05:14:00]  In the office, we were talking about the episodes of I Love Lucy.  Where, uh, they would do placement, product placement for Philip Morris.  It was a cigarette company that sponsored the show.  And, uh, Lucy would offer people cigarettes that came over the house in a candy dish.  Full of cigarettes that were on, on the table of a, it's a TV show.  Ah, they'd be like wafts of smoke on the set.  You know, the whole studio probably just stunk.  The set had nicotine dripping down the walls.  You'd have to squeegee off the camera lens. 
[05:14:30]  And Tara Reid's starting to sound like, uh.  Ah, Mr. Mooney.  We're here in Papillonas, babe.  Ah, ah.  I'm not going to run with the balls.  It's crazy.  Guys.  Well, I think we have some Tara audio here.  Yeah.  Let's listen to this.  Water activities.  We went on this other route thing.  It was called a fly fish.  And it's like this thing where everyone kind of lays down in it. 
[05:15:00]  And it just flies up in the air.  And we in Paris, we're screaming.  We're so scared.  It was so high that I thought it was going to flip over the other way.  I think I broke my feet and my eyeballs. 
[05:15:30]  Oh, my gosh.  Honestly, we really hurt each other.  And I think my leg is broken.  I have black and blues on my legs right here.  On it, it's crazy.  But it's so much fun.  We did every water sport you could possibly imagine.  People are watching this shit.  She's got one of those voices that just beat around every few words.  Just stop talking.  And then we went on this thing.  It's called a fly fish.  It's fantastically fun.  Like her voice just cuts out. 
[05:16:00]  It's like a cell phone call.  Here we are in Australia.  It's wonderful.  We're by the great.  Just cuts out.  Not getting a signal.  Good signal.  Sultry, people are saying the voice is called.  Sultry.  Sultry.  Mike on Long Island.  What's up, Mike?  I caught a glimpse of that show the other day.  It is the most cool show on TV.  All she talks about is how exclusive she's getting into. 
[05:16:30]  And you've got to hear the person herself.  This is the terror zone or the region.  This is like really exclusive.  It's the most.  Hey, stop ripping off Anthony.  Anthony came up with the voice that just, you know, craps out.  His phone.  He's got a terrible voice.  The voice phone.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Here's another clip.  This is hysterical.  My camera crew comes in.  And then all these other camera crews are like flashes everywhere.  And we're like, what is going on?  It all happened at once.  And Paris and Paris are like, wow, she's a big crew. 
[05:17:00]  I'm sitting there like, who are all these people?  It all happened so quick.  There's like eight cameras, 25 paparazzis all around the table.  And it was just like, whoa.  That's our only camera.  Paris.  Paris.  That's the only camera allowed in.  You know, and then finally we got everyone else out.  But we kept ours in.  You nailed the voice, man.  She's got it.  Oh. 
[05:17:30]  She tells the worst story.  Yeah.  Like.  And I was like, wow.  I was like, awesome.  We got a bigger group in Paris.  Who cares?  Wasn't the whole thing with the original show is that it was her going to bars?  Like party locations?  Yeah.  And then what, do they run out of bars?  Because now they try to make it, make, make it more than it really is.  Where she's actually trying to get culture. 
[05:18:00]  Some of these places.  I have no idea.  Oof.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Honey and cheese.  My pride.  I love Greek words.  This is out of control.  Oh my God.  I've never in my life tasted anything better.  Like we were flipping out.  It was sick.  It was amazing.  It was so, so good.  She has like three adjectives in her whole vocabulary.  It was amazing.  So, so good. 
[05:18:30]  It was just as.  So, so good.  You need a show to have somebody tell you how delicious some food product was?  I didn't.  That's what she's talking about.  I never realized her voice was so fucked up.  All raspy.  The other thing is it all of a sudden just speeds up out of nowhere.  She loves the cigarettes is what it is.  She must be a mess to like wake up in the morning for the next show.  Just picture sprawled out on the bed in some hotel room and like jizz on the sheets and  just reeking of smoke.  Jizz in her hair.  Everything she owns must just reek of cigarette smoke. 
[05:19:00]  Just her hair all in disarray.  Her face all swollen from the night partying.  What?  I need another hour.  No, call me later.  I got sleep.  Punching the mirror.  Getting in a karate fight.  Saigon.  I can't believe I'm still in Saigon.  And then the vehicle came in and I was like, wow. 
[05:19:30]  First and ninth air cab.  Air mobile.  I was going to blow this off, but we have to hear more of her.  It's horrible.  Of her speech.  Oh.  Paris and Paris couldn't have been any kinder.  You know, they just took us in and showed us the other side of Greece that we wouldn't  have ever gotten to know.  We were dancing and singing together.  I mean, there was just so much love there. 
[05:20:00]  Paris and Paris, they're truly love.  I think it's beautiful.  Truly what?  Paris and Paris, they're truly just beautiful.  She hacks up a tumor.  I think people are going to see I'm not just a party girl.  I care about people.  I'm kind of goofy and I have a funny side to me, too.  Look at this.  It's insane.  What is that?  That's the Acropolis.  And the main building is the Parthelon.  And what is that?  This is a man you made from the...  So is he one of the gods? 
[05:20:30]  Like Herculeys?  No, no.  No, no.  That's mythology.  This is the real thing.  It was the golden age of Harry Cloyce, built 2,500 years ago.  So he was a guy?  Yes.  See, I'm confused.  Did you know this?  You guys don't know either.  So don't make me look really stupid.  He was the guy that built that, right?  He was like the governor back then.  And that's how democracy started.  Is he the guy that did the thing with the potatoes?  He was like, right?  That guy was a leader. 
[05:21:00]  He ruled Greece and there was no potatoes.  And he wanted the economy to be better.  I'm learning way too much stuff.  Is that like when the ruins were?  Exactly.  Okay, see?  I'm getting smarter by the minute.  It was one of the birthplaces of civilization.  And it was amazing.  Amazing.  We should stick to the good clubs.  Yeah, let's talk about the clubs.  I'm just don't know where to say that.  That's consistent right now.  I don't know if she's looking like a rock scientist.  Holy...  I don't know.  Do we need a translation? 
[05:21:30]  I'm learning too much stuff.  I'm trying to get a history lesson.  I don't think that part of the show is very good.  Do you hear the sound effects?  They actually make fun of her because...  Yeah.  Boing!  She's so stupid.  She's like the one with the potatoes.  That's the one with the potatoes.  Because I know there was a leader and he has people and the potatoes.  They ran out of potatoes.  And I got to get some more potatoes.  Is that the guy?  Is that the guy?  Give me a fucking drink.  I need a drink.  Fabulous. 
[05:22:00]  We have Tara Reid on the phone.  Tara!  Hi, boys.  Hey, Tara.  Wow, you sound sexy with that voice.  What's up, Tara Reid?  I was out all night partying with Tara.  Hey, a bunch of my friends were telling me you guys were talking about me.  So what's going on?  What's up, Tara?  I like when they call that have no material.  Hi, it's Tara Reid. 
[05:22:30]  Again, having to say who it is.  Well, it had potential.  One more clip.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah, we'd like to eat dinner at least three times a day.  Yeah, I mean, can you tell?  I'm going to be a monster by the end of it.  Hello.  I need to honestly get my mouth stapled and just talk out of a straw.  All I do is eat.  I'm getting fatter by the second.  I'm going to need a girl.  We're going to get me in a bikini.  I'm just a monster now.  It's only something. 
[05:23:00]  Have you ever seen me this big in your life?  I have no idea what she said.  And she just laughs.  A little bit about being a fat bikini.  Yeah, I think it's like.  A fat bikini photo.  If we keep eating, I'm going to get a huge amount of bikini.  I'm not going to be able to fit into it.  I'm going to have to get my mouth stapled and eat through a straw.  She didn't even say that.  She's going to breathe through a straw or something.  I don't know.  Talk through a straw.  It's like, isn't it getting your jaw wired shut and eating through a straw?  She's like getting my mouth stapled and talking through a straw. 
[05:23:30]  She gets everything wrong.  She was confusing Greek mythology with the potato famine.  And then the god Apollo needed french fries and he couldn't find any.  So he had to get a Perisopheles guy and he came down and actually got them curly fries.  That's amazing.  Dope.  What adult.  That's fucking unbelievable. 
[05:24:00]  I can't book anything.  She's on television.  You've got to be a train wreck, Bill.  Oh my god, I just got the side yesterday.  I didn't have a chance to do that.  You guys.  She's on TV.  There it is.  On TV.  God has a show.  People talk about it.  People watch it.  Encore, one more clip.  Of course.  Talking about food.  More food.  What is going on with the potatoes and the bread?  I mean, guys, are you trying to make me fat by the second?  I'm not eating them.  Guys, my ass is jiggling.  You can't starve yourself and be like a typical actress that doesn't eat and do a movie that we did 
[05:24:30]  because it's too intense.  Do you know what I mean?  So, literally, you ate what you could.  So, we ate stuff that's for energy, but it was fucking food.  So, we got fat.  Yeah, head in the line.  But we'll get it off.  Here, you pass the Greek salad.  That's really good.  It's them eating and talking about getting fat from eating shitty food.  Honey.  But, like, the movie is, like, so intense.  I did American Pie.  It's the dry place that I had to go. 
[05:25:00]  It's an actor.  It's so hard.  We're eating food here.  It's such a shame for it.  I get fat.  You know, it was different on the set of my motion picture, Josie and the Pussycats.  We had such great food there.  Now, it's his hub of...  Michael Jordan from Alabama writes,  Tara Reid actually said rock scientist instead of rocket scientist.  Rock scientist?  Yeah, I did hear that.  Fantastic.  Rock scientist.  She is the greatest.  All right.  I'm looking forward to the next program. 
[05:25:30]  We need more Tara Clips.  Yeah?  Please put that on the list.  You want to do some Tara things?  Yeah.  All right.  Tara Clips on the way for you, Anthony.  Tara Clips.  There you go.  Who the hell was that?  Did you hear that?  Whose stomach just growled?  Was that yours?  Yeah, but...  But you've been eating granola.  It was really low, though.  That wasn't my stomach.  That was one of those internal farts. 
[05:26:00]  Yeah.  Did you hear that?  Yeah, it doesn't get...  It's like, you know, your intestine...  This is a great segue.  Well...  I haven't talked about farts in a few days.  Here we go, guys.  Because your intestine is a bunch of, like, muscles, just like your sphincter,  only it's, like, on the whole length of it, and that pushes everything down.  So when you get gas in there, and the gas squeezes through one of these closed sphincter muscles,  it sounds exactly like a fart, only it's inside.  Right.  And sometimes it can sound exactly like a fart, like muffled from the sheets or something. 
[05:26:30]  But no one's going to be bothered by it.  Right.  Because it just stinks inside you.  Oh, my God, the fart was inside me.  And just, that was amazing.  And they were looking at me, and I was like, you guys.  I was with this guy once, and all of a sudden, I thought I had a fart, and I was inside fart.  And I almost came out.  And then I did fart, and it came out as a smoke ring.  And everyone laughed and laughed.  And I didn't know I could blow smoke rings.  And I fired in the last cigarette I had was, like, 15 minutes ago, and I still had a smoke. 
[05:27:00]  Tarek and the gang are loving the new impression, the new Anthony impression.  Paul, who knew you could do Tara, Anthony?  Who knew?  Who knew?  Horrible whore.  All right.  Want to take a break?  All righty.  All right.  Before we go to break, we have Tara Reid calling back.  Yes, Tara.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Say hi to my friend Ray Romano.  Ray, are you there? 
[05:27:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Ray, you sound so crazy.  Remember the night we went out to the club, and I had a club in my hand, and we were doing  a club thing?  No.  Sometimes when I eat too much food with Ray Romano, he goes crazy.  He doesn't know what to say.  I don't know what to do either.  Right, Ray?  Oh, what are you doing?  Stop talking about that.  Oh, God.  I don't understand you, Ray.  You crazy guy.  Oh, wow.  He pushed out.  Very good.  You could now go down to the UCB and just be a star. 
[05:28:00]  A little improv like that.  Yeah, I know.  Do a little Ray Romano.  Most amazing thing ever.  You get into there a little clique.  You won't just be a stand-up anymore.  I have as much ability to do Ray as Tara has knowledge of Europe.  Potatoes and Greek mythology.  She has three things I got.  No.  Potatoes and Greek mythology.  She mixed up the potato famine with Greek mythology.  Fantastic.  Opie and Anthony's Best Bits.  Best Drew Boogie Remix. 
[05:28:30]  Number four.  Maybe those people are so poor.  Some of the people who do that, they're so poor.  They've never touched anything in their lives.  Let them touch those things for one.  All together now.  Let them touch those things.  Let them touch those things.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't take things for once.  Take a kayak. 
[05:29:00]  Take a kayak.  Take a kayak.  Take a kayak.  Take a kayak.  Uut.  Uut.  Uut.  Uut.  Uut.  Uut.  Uut.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, what the.  What the?  What, what, what, what the, what the. ��?  Oh well, take a cardiac.  H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-have.  We'll talk about those things .

[05:32:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is a bit I pioneered.  This is Nathaniel, by the way.  Got absolutely no help from either Danny or Travis.  Because they're pieces of shit.  It's bombs and flubs.  You can figure out what it's about.  Because like E-Rock says, it's self-explanatory.  Brand new bit on the radio show.  Thanks to Nathaniel and maybe some of the other guys.  I'm not really sure.  Who should get credit for this?  No, no, they're shaking their heads.  Uh-oh. 
[05:32:30]  All Nathaniel?  They don't want credit for this.  They don't want any credit.  Here's Than.  It's a new bit called Bombs and Flubs.  Bombs and Flubs.  Yes, people bombing on the show.  Yeah.  And people flubbing on the show.  Flubbing their words and just bombing with jokes.  And what pisses me off under the Flubs section, it's all me and Jimmy.  Because Anthony talks perfectly.  No, I've had my share, that's for sure. 
[05:33:00]  Well, they couldn't find one, Anthony.  It's just what I happened to record.  They couldn't find one example of you flubbing a line.  Or flubbing a word.  How about pundit?  I know.  I know, that's a perfect one.  That was a good one.  That'll be in volume two.  Yeah, this is the start of a new bit.  Which isn't all that far off.  Pundit.  Pundit.  Yeah, I must have heard that wrong years ago and it just stuck.  I noticed there's a lot of examples from last week's show.  Did you?  Well, I did notice there was a mandate put out about wanting more of this sort of thing. 
[05:33:30]  But yes, it's a lot from last week.  You know you've been doing this show for nine months, right?  That's what I heard.  And you got a week.  You know how I know that?  Well, it's a new bit.  So it'll grow from here.  Yeah.  We'd like to see the beginning of some of these bits and then they take on a life of their own.  Right.  But here's Nathaniel's bombs and flubs.  Here's the first bomb from Anthony.  Oh.  This was a rape joke that went horribly wrong, I believe.  If you could believe it. 
[05:34:00]  He was talking to Paul's wife.  Paul's wife.  Okay.  You know, the couple that came in last week and gave us great radio.  All right.  Here we go.  Police arrested seven men who allegedly kidnapped and gang raped a married woman in retaliation  for her cousin's affair with one of the suspect's daughters.  What a deal.  Wow.  One suspect was angered over a relationship between his 17-year-old daughter and the victim's  20-year-old cousin.  So him and his friends got together and fucked their mom.  Um...  Okay. 
[05:34:30]  I hear she blew the whole thing, though.  Yeah.  By actually accepting it and just going through with it.  It's not rape, it's okay.  It ruined it for them because they wanted to rape her and she just, you know, agreed with  it and, yeah, where am I going?  It was fun just watching you meander down that dead end.  Out of my peripheral vision, I just see Jimmy's teeth so I know he's smiling.  Yeah, I'm just bummed out of here.  How much longer am I going to keep this fucking...  Scotty, what's up?  One wheel left on that car. 
[05:35:00]  Oh, I was working the controls.  I was trying to keep that joke airborne.  I have no elevator control whatsoever.  Nothing.  I went in flames.  Oh, this is great.  Oh, did that hurt.  Bombs and flubs.  The next bomb is from our own Ben.  Ben?  Good old Ben made the bombs and flubs.  I bombed.  Jim, were you upset that Ozzy didn't play Live 8?  Yep.  Hold on, sir.  What?  Were you upset that Ozzy didn't play Live 8?  No, I heard it.  I just wanted to bomb twice. 
[05:35:30]  He did it again.  Oh, by the way...  Because Jimmy smiled and goes, what?  Like just waiting for him to do it again so he could turn it around.  Oh, he wound right up and threw it again.  Wow, that is really funny.  These are funny.  When you take them completely out of context here and throw them in.  God damn, this is going to be a great new bit on the show, Nathaniel.  Yeah, good job, Booth, not taking any credit for this.  Yeah. 
[05:36:00]  Smart move.  All right, the next bomb is from Colin.  Good old Colin Quinn.  Colin's like when Frank used to show up on Carson.  Yeah.  You know, he'd just pop in, sit on the couch, talk a little, and then you think he's going  to just slide over?  Yeah.  And let, like, George Goebel sit down and have an interview?  No, he's getting up, he's leaving.  He's too busy.  Norton's like Frank, too.  Frank Gorshin, that is.  Dead.  That's exactly what you should leave on.  Wow, these are real bombs. 
[05:36:30]  Figures that fucking old man, that's the first Frank reference he can yank out.  Guy's been on TV since 1968.  This is like a blooper.  A blooper reel.  The gag reel.  I like it.  All right.  That was my favorite part of Cannonball Run when they just show the floor.  Oh, at the end.  Where they're supposed to say one thing, but Dom DeLuise is blowing a guy who's bringing  him his food in the room?  You're not supposed to say that.  Your line isn't, you're so young. 
[05:37:00]  And Burt Reynolds goes to tip his cap and it's his wig and some skin comes up.  Good day to you.  Ow.  Gets mad and punches the craft services girl right in the face.  All right, here we go with old Jimmy Norton's bomb.  This couldn't be a bomb.  You had a Y2K joke, did you?  I bet you there were big laughs and they took him out.  Probably.  In post.  You had a Y2K joke, did you?  One of the problems that they were saying was going to happen was that the computer systems 
[05:37:30]  were going to backdate 100 years.  Yeah.  Because the old one flipped.  They would have went back to 1901.  1900.  And I said, that's going to be great.  It's going to help me in my big court case.  What are they going to do?  Prosecute me for having sex with a girl who's 114?  Yeah.  A lot more.  No.  No.  No.  That was a good one.  Wouldn't that make her younger?  Well, it didn't make perfect mathematical sense.  Yeah, because that would have happened.  Like, right when I got that, it's like, if she was 14 in the year 2000, let's say, if 
[05:38:00]  it was then 1900, she's not even born yet.  Well, let's be happy that you weren't in the audience.  Three years I was doing it beforehand.  You're talking about Y2K since, you know, 1971.  Yes, they were.  Wow.  Glad I brought that up.  How will it affect your Pong game?  We'll tell you.  Let's, uh...  71?  No.  Double bomb.  Nice.  That was a...  I piggybacked onto your bomb bit.  I was going down in flames, and you decided just to get in the cockpit with me.  I was jumping in.  Hey, it looks toasty in there. 
[05:38:30]  I'm a little hurt, by the way.  Anthony has one bomb and zero flubs.  I kind of have two bombs, though.  I was a bomb in that one.  Yeah.  My Pong joke didn't go over very well.  It was overshadowed by Jimmy's bomb a little bit, but...  Here's, uh, bombs and flubs, another bomb.  Ooh, Jimmy Norton again.  Keep on chugling.  All right, we get it.  He's chugling along.  Did you get that instant feedback?  Seven more minutes.  Play Keep on Chugling.  It was from John F. at Yahoo.com. 
[05:39:00]  It's John Fogarty.  Of course.  I got it.  It didn't help, but I got it.  I got it.  It did not help.  How do I suck?  You know, when you're live on the air like this, you throw them out and just hope they  connect, and sometimes they just don't, Jimmy.  We all understand.  We got to do another one. 
[05:39:30]  Nervous listeners is another one, maybe.  Oh, yeah.  Another one that go-getters could take up.  Who wants to run with that one in that office, huh?  Travis?  I've already started to list myself.  Maybe I can hand it off to one of the other.  Oh!  Delegating responsibility.  See now, look at him.  One of my inferiors, maybe.  You have middle management written all over you.  Sweet.  All right, it's bombs and flubs.  Well, we could just go to the next one.  We'll skip this. 
[05:40:00]  What?  Why is that?  What?  There's no skipping.  What?  There's no skipping Nathaniel's hard work.  What happened?  I'd rather not skip it.  I want to hear it.  How do you know it was the gang who just circled St. Vincent's?  Just circled the Statue of Liberty and pointed at the Statue of Liberty and said, that's a  woman?  No.  Well, she's glum glum.  That was a boat crash.  I should have just enjoyed your great line. 
[05:40:30]  It was taking too long to get you.  You were going, well, you're circling it, and I saw you going, oh, shit.  Well, you kind of threw me off.  I had a really good line, and then you killed with that line, and then I'm like, why am I  doing this?  In the middle of it, I'm like, why am I even doing this now?  Why?  Comedy is all about timing.  I'm like, I knew since I started.  I'm like, why am I doing this?  Why?  Wow.  That is so funny, having to explain it and being there all red-faced.  Oh, it's the worst. 
[05:41:00]  Oh.  Just circling the Statue of Liberty.  Whenever you pluralize something, you have to make it singular.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Wow, that was rough.  Yeah.  That was very uncomfortable.  We've all been there.  We've all been there.  Here's another bomb from British Paul.  Is that his name on the show now?  British Paul?  I don't know.  Yeah, we're all there.  No, they just felt like there was nothing moving them around.  Like dead weight?  Yeah.  Was it like holding arms, those thin, muscle-less calves? 
[05:41:30]  Two white shoes on?  Fucking nurse shoes?  Useless shoes?  Never, the soles never get dirty?  Pristine sneakers?  Still have that, like, news sticker on the bottom?  It's like, I was imagining that scene from I'm Gonna Get You Sucker, where they go and  put their legs up on the nightstand.  But they were real.  Oh, fuck.  You didn't know. 
[05:42:00]  Fucking Obie just fucked me up.  Yeah, he's describing sex with a lady that's paralyzed from the waist down.  All right, we got another bomb from British Paul.  Finishing up the bomb section of the bombs and flubs bit.  So how did you, did you kind of think like, hmm, this is perplexing, because if she's numb  down there, what the hell am I supposed to do?  If she says that's a huge fucking dick, when it's in there, I'll be like, hmm, wonder if  she's lying.  Oh, I love when they bomb. 
[05:42:30]  Very good.  How did Kev not get any bombs?  Wow.  What did you go back a week?  You just went a week, didn't you?  Well, because we just kind of came up with this thing.  Gonna have to really go through the history of the time we've been here.  Drudge up some of those old bombs.  Yeah, because this is a great new bit, it really is.  I like it.  There's some, the flubs go back a little farther. 
[05:43:00]  All right.  All right, now here's some flubs, Anthony, from the show.  Here's old Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy?  The flubs are all Jimmy and I.  That's it.  Really?  No, Anthony.  I know, I understand.  And no one else from the show.  Ant does weigh in on one and flub in the process.  Oh, goody.  Oh, can we guess which one here?  No, I'm just, leave it teased.  Flubs.  Eric Logan sent out an ass email about these tapes and he said that she's having a tough  time at the breakup. 
[05:43:30]  That might have been better if I didn't say he sent out an ass email.  Ass email.  He did say that.  An ass email, yeah.  I remember that one.  That's technically everyone that Logan sends out.  Look, you recouped right here a month later.  All right, here's another one from Jimmy.  That's great.  Detroit auto walker.  I had Ivan Demjeniuk was the name I was, I remember.  Right, right.  There you go.  Of course, but I couldn't get Detroit auto walker. 
[05:44:00]  And a Detroit auto walker named Ivan Demjeniuk.  No!  Did you see that jerk?  What a walker.  Yeah.  Here's myself flubbing away.  The bleeps aren't cursed, are they?  No.  The bleeps aren't cursed.  Yes, they are.  Stay away from the bleeps. 
[05:44:30]  They are cursed.  They've been damned.  You got a little mixed up there.  Happens every day, actually.  Here's Jimmy.  As you're blowing out your 80th birthday cake candles, a couple of large men come in with  gloves and push your face into it until your feet stop moving.  What are gloves?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sounds that Connor and Lacey make.  Oh, my God.  Hey, flub, but came back strong. 
[05:45:00]  Wow, you certainly did, Jimmy.  You came back strong.  It's not been a great joke until you're blowing out your 80th birthday candles and men push  your face into the cake until you die.  I don't know what I was talking about, but I'm really proud of myself.  I wish I could have got that one after.  Yeah.  Good one.  Conceptually a gem.  Back to me.  If you want to see the epitome of an absolutely...  Epitome.  Oh, epitome.  Sorry.  Epitome.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my Lord.  Epitome.  Yeah, I remember that one. 
[05:45:30]  All right, well, Anthony's perfect, so we go back to Jimmy.  No, I know I got plenty.  We were just kidding when we simulated the home invasion.  We didn't really rape his rife wife.  Ah, fuck.  Rape his rife.  We didn't rape his rife.  We didn't rape his rife.  I'd dive a bus.  I'd bribe my bus.  You actually just said it right.  I know.  You're stinking.  Were we in, Taiwan?  What the hell?  God.  Weaked his rife.  I don't know.  I was so eager to spit that one out.  Yes, you are. 
[05:46:00]  My little rotten, thin lips wouldn't open fast enough.  You were stumbling through that line right from the beginning.  You could hear him like you were constantly trying to catch up with your tongue.  Back to me.  Does Flavor Flay and VH1 and everyone realize that we're off the air in like 15 minutes?  You do know it's Flavor Flav.  Flav's running a little late.  He should be here soon.  Oh, but do you absolutely know it's Flavor Flav with a V?  Yeah, but that's how they say it in the ghetto.  Flavor Flay.  Do they say Flavor Flay?  Yeah, they get lazy at the end of words sometimes. 
[05:46:30]  No, it's actually Flavor Flavor.  That's why Flavor Flav is the cuddle.  Flavor Flavor?  But you could just say Flavor Flay.  Flavor Flay.  I don't know.  That's been nitpicking a bit.  A little bit.  Back to Jimmy.  Did the soup actually fall into the soup or did the part where your mouth goes just commit  suicide and jump?  I think it was where my mouth goes.  Did the soup actually fall into the soup?  Wait, did I say that?  Oh my God.  Did I say that?  You just said, did the soup actually fall into the soup? 
[05:47:00]  Well, that's a legitimate question because sometimes soup will get mixed up and I hate  when another man's soup falls into my soup.  Did your phone fall into your phone?  Wow.  You just don't even know that you did that.  No.  I just love Anthony, just the disappointment in his voice right after someone flubs.  Well, I enjoy Jimmy so much that I want to hear what he's saying.  When he fucks it up, it's taking away entertainment from me. 
[05:47:30]  That's right.  He's stealing from you.  But you also get a little joy out of it.  I get a lot of joy out of it.  You said epitome.  You can't get past that.  Well, look how it's spelt.  It's spelt epitome.  All right, I don't want to do this bit anymore.  This bit stinks.  And I'm thinking, you know, I got some outdoor space in Manhattan.  Maybe I'll have an alpaca running around. 
[05:48:00]  Yeah, they have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years.  Okay.  So the kid won't be heartbroken right away like a goldfish or something.  And they look like llamas?  Llamas?  Llamas.  They look like...  Llamas.  I corrected myself really fast.  Yama.  Boss would have said, why?  Why?  Jesus.  Oh, black.  Yama.  That's good.  Hey, the Yama.  The Yama.  Oh, this is painful. 
[05:48:30]  Back to Jimmy.  Because Anthony's perfect.  Yeah.  I had a bigger ride when Cronkate...  Cronkate.  Oh.  Oh, at least you didn't say Cronkate.  Cronkite gave a sexier proclamation of JFK's death was what I was calling.  Took his glasses off.  That was hot.  Yeah.  Cronkate.  Cronkate.  Oh, you horrible. 
[05:49:00]  He's disgusted with himself.  Cronkate.  That's a good one.  All right.  It's kind of like the Cronkite Watergate scandal.  Oh.  Mark that one, fan.  Asterisk.  In case you need a little reference.  That's a flom.  I bet you've bombed a flub.  Here's another one.  One day I'll change it and just say I grabbed Richard by the hair and said, 
[05:49:30]  Suck my cock, bitch.  Suck my cock.  Cop?  Jesus.  Forget it.  In a bit.  Suck my cock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we put a siren in that car?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, dear Lord.  And finally, the last barman flub for today.  Who is it?  It's not you.  Give me an H.  Give me a Y.  Give me an S.  Give me a T.  Give me an R. 
[05:50:00]  What's it spell?  The beginning of hysterectomy.  Hysterectomy?  Hysterectomy.  Is it H-E?  No, H-Y.  H-Y-S-T-E-R.  You said R.  S-T-E-R.  Yeah, you said S-T-R.  You sure?  I'm positive.  Play the tape back.  I'm pretty sure I said E-R.  No, you fucked up.  I certainly didn't.  Hysterectomy.  I'm sorry.  You'll have to get a hysterectomy.  But did you hear the way I bailed out of it?  Trying to feel like spelling out the entire word?  Of course. 
[05:50:30]  Especially after leaving out a letter.  Hysterectomy.  It's not bad at all.  A little comma in there.  Just take that letter out.  Let's say hi to Andy in New Jersey.  It sounds friendly.  Andy.  You know, what's up?  Hey, listen.  Anthony does mess up, man.  Every time he says finger, younger.  Finger, younger.  Stop it.  That's right.  Finger.  It's good that you picked those two words to put together, too.  Mark it out.  Her.  Younger.  Finger.  Younger.  Younger. 
[05:51:00]  Nathaniel, bravo.  Good job.  Thank you.  Yes.  The first installment of Bombs and Flubs.  How come there's no enthusiastic applause coming from the booth?  That's weird.  Yeah, what?  Anyone want to take any credit now for a little help?  No?  No.  To be honest.  It's cute.  They're a little jealous.  I think so.  There you go.  All right.  All yearning.  Like puppies in a basket.  When you take one out and pet it, they all look like, why aren't you petting me?  That's right.  Silence of the Lambs musical. 
[05:51:30]  There's really nothing more to say about this than it's just absolutely brilliant.  To take Silence of the Lambs and write a fucking parody song to it is just amazing in itself.  So behold the majesty.  Silence of the musical.  Thanks for holding one finger over your ear like you're fucking recording We Are the World.  Because it's going to fall off my head like that.  You asshole.  I don't want to muss my jelly hair.  Breaking news.  Hey, who's this?  This is John and Al.  John and Al?  Yeah, we're both here. 
[05:52:00]  Hi, guys.  You guys are calling from California?  Yep.  So it's like 640.  Sorry to wake you.  Whatever you guys are doing there, man.  But this Silence of the Lambs, the musical, is freaking hilarious.  You got to tell us a little bit about it.  All right.  We wrote it about.  Yeah, I can recognize the voice.  Yeah, you did Buffalo Bill, didn't you?  You did Buffalo Bill.  Hey, guess a little Buffalo Bill.  Would you have me?  God, I feel like I'm talking to a big-time celebrity now.  All right.  Dude, we're all humming your songs.  In the truck. 
[05:52:30]  How about, was she a great big fat person?  Was she a great big fat person?  Very cool.  So why did you guys decide to make this?  Well, obviously, I mean, it's a hit, but.  We just did it for fun, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, we know that.  Basically, we saw that there was a song in Singing in the Rain called Would You, and that's  one of our favorite Buffalo Bill lines.  Like, for years, we'd always go, would you?  That came up to the idea.  So we had, like, an idea for, like, five or six songs within a minute, and then we just 
[05:53:00]  did it.  What kind of musical background you got?  We have a composition degree from USC.  Really?  Yeah.  That's nice.  Where'd you get the, you made all the music and everything?  Yeah, we did it all in our apartment.  All in your apartment?  Just you guys, or did you have, like, orchestras?  No.  It sounds really good.  It's all us, and we had a woman sing on the chorus, but that's it.  It's great.  It's really great.  We can't get enough of this thing.  Are you selling this, or until they shut you down? 
[05:53:30]  We had it online, like, for, like, a year and a half for free, and, like, lost a lot  of money with people just downloading it, but that's basically what we wanted.  Yeah.  And now we sell it just to try and make some of the money back.  Basically, we're breaking even, because we still have it online, and it costs, like,  80 bucks a month.  Where can they get the, uh, where can they get it online?  Uh, silencethemusical.com.  Was it one of your favorite movies?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What's your favorite song off this thing?  That's a good one.  Uh, the lotion song. 
[05:54:00]  Yeah, obviously.  Yeah, that's the hit, man.  That one is just too goddamn funny.  That's your welcome to the jungle.  Fantastic.  We also like Are You About a Size 14?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one, too.  Sure.  And, uh, well, If I Could Smell Her Sea is pretty good.  We played that one, because we're on satellite radio.  Any other movies that you thought about doing this to?  Uh, Robocop.  Oh, that would be funny.  And Spartacus, but we shall see.  Cool.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, we just want to say hi to you guys, because we've been having a lot of fun with this, uh, 
[05:54:30]  song the last week or so.  And we're going to link you guys to our website, so.  Would you?  Fuck me hard.  Hey, what was that song, I'm crying over you, crying, you know the song in the background  that he's tucking his dick between his legs and dancing to?  Oh, yeah, the real song in the movie.  Crying over you.  Yeah, it's really a hot number.  I don't know what the name of that song is.  A hot number?  Yeah.  Over you.  Dirty mechanic fingernails, tweaking his own nipples. 
[05:55:00]  Fuck me hard.  I love it.  Great job, guys.  Silence the musical dot com.  What?  Yeah, these guys are half asleep.  I mean, let's be honest here.  Your website is silence the musical dot com.  People can purchase this.  Yeah.  And maybe a few of our listeners should purchase it, please.  I know our fans are, you know, internet savvy, but someone throw some money at these guys.  I'll just tape it off the fucking radio. 
[05:55:30]  Fuck these guys, I hope that they go for all.  Put the fucking money in the PayPal.  All right, if you guys got anything else you want us to play on the radio, just contact  Steve, okay?  Okay, thanks a lot.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  See you later.  There they go, John and Al.  Very funny.  Very funny.  A couple of artistes.  They're just hanging out there in California.  How long ago did they do that?  It's like what?  About a year and a half ago.  About a year and a half ago? 
[05:56:00]  Are they still in school?  No, they're both, they're working at some place that has to do with film composition.  What did they get together so early in the morning for?  They're brothers.  Doing goofball musicals.  Oh, they're brothers.  They're brothers.  Okay, I was thinking maybe there was a lava thing going on there.  He's my lava.  Put your fucking dick in my asshole.  Put your fucking cock in my funky treasure.  I think it's two chimps on a Davenport and a face.  The O.P. and Amity Show.

It's the best bits of Opie and Anthony since coming to XM Satellite Radio, and one of our favorite in-studio guests was Howie Mandel.  Howie's a germaphobe, and he explains to us a time when he was potty-training his daughter, and it went all wrong. 
[06:00:30]  This is O&A's best bits.  I'll tell you, I've had horrible potty-training stories.  I had one where my daughter, my first daughter, my daughter's like 21 now, but when she was young, I guess how old are you when you're potty-training?  You're almost two years old?  Depends on the chromosomes.  Right.  But my wife was really into the potty-training, you know, and read all the books, and you have to, you know, after she pees or shits in the potty, you know, we all had to applaud, and everybody was around. 
[06:01:00]  It's a big deal.  She's just about potty-training.  My wife says, I was going out one day, and she says, you take her, you take her with you.  So I have this baby in the car seat, and she's just a little girl, a little baby, and we're out someplace, and she says to me, Dad, I have to go potty.  And, you know, my heart, I get heart palpitations.  I'm thinking, I can't go in a public restroom.  I can't sit her down.  And where am I going to take her?  I can't go in the men's room, and I don't want her to sit down.  I mean, I can't go in the ladies' room.  I don't want her to sit down in the men's room. 
[06:01:30]  So I said, honey, you know, can you hold it?  Is there any way to hold it?  And she goes, you know, the baby.  Yes.  She goes, I'll try, Daddy, because she could see the horror in my eyes.  She goes, I'll try, Dad.  So I put her in the car, and I put her in the car seat.  And we're driving down the Ventura Freeway.  I live in Los Angeles.  We're driving down the Ventura Freeway.  And she goes from the back seat.  I hear, Daddy, I can't hold it.  I go, okay, honey, we'll pull off here, and we'll go to the gas station or something.  She goes, no, I can't hold it.  I go, okay, okay, fine. 
[06:02:00]  So we pull over to the side of the freeway, the side of the Ventura Freeway, this public freeway.  And I pull out, and there's, like, hedges on the side of the freeway there.  So I get her out.  I unbuckle her from the car seat, and I put her in my arm, and I go over to the hedges.  And I take one step over to the hedges, and I don't realize it's a gully.  It's a ravine.  Oh, my God.  So I step, and I slip on my back.  I fall on my back, and I start hurtling down this mountain, down the side of the Ventura Freeway.  And I'm holding the baby.  I'm coddling on my side.  She's screaming.  I'm yelling.  The twigs are breaking. 
[06:02:30]  There's mud that my pants rip.  It cuts my ass.  And I end up at the bottom of this gully in this horrible, like, infested kind of wet puddle.  And I'm bleeding, and I'm in this gully.  And I'm holding the baby, and she's crying.  And I kind of stand up, and I hold her in front of me.  And she goes, I got to go.  I got to pee.  I go, okay.  All right.  And I look.  My wife had put her in some sort of, like, a jumpsuit kind of thing.  So I unbuckle the thing, and I pull it down around her ankles, and I'm holding her up by the armpits in front of me. 
[06:03:00]  And I go, okay, honey.  Go, go.  And she goes, I can't.  I'm going to pee on my pants.  I'm going to pee because her legs are down below.  And this is the first daughter.  I've never really, you know, I grew up with brothers and everything.  I said, okay, all right.  Put your, just put your feet up on my shoulders, up on my neck.  Hold, I'm holding her in front of me, like, face to face.  Put your feet up on my neck.  And then I figure, you know, your legs are out toward me.  And then you'll pee down into this.  If your cough saw this, you'd be shot, by the way.  Right.  So her feet are up on my neck.  And I go, okay, go.  Well, I didn't know that.  It seems like, you know, with the vagina, that the, whatever way your feet are aiming is what way the fluid goes. 
[06:03:30]  So she goes, and then all of a sudden it's in my face.  She's pissing in my face.  My fucking mouth.  In my mouth.  I'm screaming like a woman.  Like, my ass is bleeding.  I'm standing in a puddle of, this is for a guy who didn't want to go into a public bathroom.  And I start to scream.  And she's screaming.  And it's all over her clothes.  And she goes, I got it on my clothes.  Her fucking clothes. 
[06:04:00]  It's in my fucking mouth.  So I'm trying to be a good dad.  And I take off her, the bottom of her pants.  And now she's naked.  And my hands are covered in the mud and the blood.  So now it's all over her.  And I'm filled with piss.  She's filled with piss.  And I try to climb the hill.  Now I'm climbing the hill and it's mud.  You know, and I get up like five steps.  And then I slide back down the hill.  And she's crying.  And I'm almost crying.  And I can't breathe.  And, you know, my heart.  I think I'm going to have a heart attack.  Finally, after it seems like an eternity, I get up on top on the freeway. 
[06:04:30]  And I come through the hedges like 500 feet from where my car is.  And I'm standing there.  And I'm bleeding.  And I'm covered in mud.  And she's crying.  And there's piss.  And there's blood.  And a car slows down.  And I got a naked little girl out of the hedges.  And the car slows down.  And it pulls down his window and goes, are you Howie Mandel?  And I said, no, get the fuck out of here.  No.  And we get into the car.  My wife is waiting.  My wife has never let me take the, I don't really take the kids out anymore.  No, I wouldn't let you either.  That's, what a horrific story. 
[06:05:00]  Oh, I hate when that happens.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck you.  We'll be in Anthony's Best Bits.  Favorite show intro.  Hey, we don't all sound that dumb.  Number three.  Most people come to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray.  One couple allegedly came to the New York City landmark to have sex, sex, sex.  Good morning.  Based on a dare from radio hosts here in New York.  Hello.  They fired these two guys.  For orchestrating an obscene stunt in New York's most famous Catholic catina. 
[06:05:30]  Shock jocks Opie and Anthony had encouraged the couple to have sex in locations where producer was waiting to call in the play-by-play.  Opie and Anthony were fired.  And their nationally syndicated show canceled.  Did these shock jocks simply go too far?  When they crossed the line.  And this is outrageous.  Oh, dear.  What are you, stupid?  Huh?  Just when everything was going good.  Greg Opie Hughes.  I like jam bags on the floor.  And Anthony.  I'm hoping for a big, fiery rear-ender. 
[06:06:00]  Broadcast an outrageous live account of a couple allegedly having sex right in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral on a holy day of obligation.  Presided over the slaughter of a wild tree.  Closed down San Francisco's Bay Bridge.  Encouraged teenage girls to run naked.  And invited listeners to compare the taste of eggnog and urine.  To score and everything up.  Shock jocks.  Not only does it involve obscenity in the most extreme form, the nerve of these people to actually have it as a setup.  No crap, Sherlock.  Die. 
[06:06:30]  Die.  Die.  Some of you new listeners might not have met Dee Dee yet.  She's one of our favorite friends of the show.  She's a fellow Exum employee who works out of the D.C. office.  And she has a very funny voice.  In fact, she sounds like a small child.  On top of that, she has a horrific accent.  This is when Opie and Anthony and Jim make fun of that accent on ONA's Best Bits.  All right, Dee Dee, you want to do some more news?  Maybe real news this time?  Hey, I had like a Rob Lowe story and I did good before, right? 
[06:07:00]  You tricked us with the Rob Lowe.  I know.  Well, you know.  All right, how about Stanton Island Animal Shelter?  What?  Animal Shelter?  It's about an animal shelter in Stanton Island.  Wait, what the hell is that?  What?  Nothing, sorry.  I don't know.  What the?  Somebody hit a button.  Okay, there you go.  I'm going to start over.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Dee Dee.  Okay, Stanton Island Animal Shelter begins killing kittens.  What?  Okay, we should. 
[06:07:30]  What?  All right.  Hold on, I was just laughing because they're making faces in the other room.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Okay, can you start again?  You asses.  Stop with that.  Okay, go ahead, Dee.  I'm sorry, Dee Dee.  Go ahead.  Yeah, just start over.  We're all looking in here.  All right.  It's Dee Dee with the news, everybody.  Go ahead, Dee Dee.  The last few months of Stanton Island Animal Shelter has been trying to find homes for all the kittens  that come in there.  Why are you laughing?  No reason.  You make Steve sound like Voss. 
[06:08:00]  Well, Steve is jumping up and down making goofy faces.  I'm sorry.  He's trying to distract the show.  Nothing.  I didn't hear.  First of all, they're all laughing.  I didn't hear where this took place or what was happening.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear about animals.  What's the story?  It's in Brooklyn.  It's in animals.  Where was it?  Steve, stop.  Okay.  I was told Stanton Island.  Okay.  All right.  And you're right.  You have the news story.  I don't.  All right.  I didn't even hear that because I was telling Steve to stop.  All right.  So why don't we start again here?  Why don't we make believe nothing happened yet?  Okay.  Here we go.  Dee, you're with the news.  Okay. 
[06:08:30]  All right.  Stanton Island.  Animals.  Why that's so funny?  Dude.  What's in there?  Nothing.  I know.  Anyway, there's an animal shelter that's killing kittens.  Because I live on Long Island.  All right.  Is that where that was?  No, it's not Long Island.  You're not on Long Island, dude.  Where was it?  I'm not going to say.  Anyway, the last few months, this animal shelter has been trying to find homes for all  the kittens that come in there.  It's not funny.  And because they can't find homes, many cute kittens are going to be turned into General 
[06:09:00]  Salve's chicken.  Why are you laughing?  And why are they going to be turned into General...  Because they're at full capacity, so they have to do it.  So come on, people.  Go get a kitten.  Don't let them die.  A kitten?  A kitten?  I can't even...  Listen.  They're going to kill them because they're at full capacity.  They only kill kittens when...  He's mocking me.  I'm not mocking you.  He's not.  He's a kitten.  That's kittens.  That's the way you say it whenever there's a hard T sound. 
[06:09:30]  Do you prefer Brooklyn or Manhattan?  Brooklyn.  Have you ever been to Manhattan?  Nope.  Okay.  You're trying to get me to say Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Damn it.  Do you like Manhattan or Australia?  Australia.  Because they have an accent.  Do you like wearing the gloves with all the fingers or those other things where it's  just the thumb?  Yeah.  What do they call that?  I forgot.  What's the word, TV?  The thumb and then the other four fingers?  You know, you wear them in the winter. 
[06:10:00]  Gloves?  No.  Not gloves.  Mittens!  All right.  Any more?  Mittens.  Mittens.  For kittens.  Yes.  In Staten Island.  Staten Island and mittens.  You have to...  There's a...  It's just a very hard T sound, which we like.  Actually, you pronounce it properly.  It just sounds weird.  It's because I'm from the Midwest, Chicago.  No, I know you're from Chicago.  That's where they say kittens.  Kittens.  Smite my kittens.  Kittens. 
[06:10:30]  Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Clittering.  Clittering.  Oh!  Okay.  So, yeah.  So, go get a kitten so they don't cry.  All right.  And a kitten.  Yes.  If you know what that is, go get one.  It's a cat.  A little cat.  Okay.  All right.  So, for the ten people listening to us in Staten Island, they're all going to go now.  No, there's no.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Okay, see how to say it, Jimmy.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  St-  St-  Yeah, Staten Island.  Staten Island. 
[06:11:00]  Yeah.  My tongue goes the other way.  Staten.  Staten.  Staten.  It's like whenever there's a T like there, like Manhattan or Staten, you usually say Manhattan  or Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Or kitten.  Kitten.  Instead of kitten.  Kitten.  No one says Staten Island.  Or kitten.  Manhattan is awful, too.  I guess I got it from Jelliet, Illinois.  How do you say Jim Norton?  Jim Norton.  Okay, see, that's right.  You have like a n sound in Norton.  You don't hard the T.  Jim Norton.  I didn't even realize the word ten was in the word kitten until just now. 
[06:11:30]  Kitten.  Kitten.  Kitten.  Staten.  That's ten.  All right, Lynn.  I can't help it.  Sorry.  Oh, it's all right.  It's okay, Dee Dee.  You're adorable.  Let's go.  Okay.  Did you get the story about the 86-year-old woman in Charlotte, North Carolina?  No.  No.  Why don't you tell me?  She was jailed after police said she called emergency dispatchers 20 times in a little  more than a half hour, all to complain that a pizza parlor wouldn't deliver. 
[06:12:00]  This old relic called 911 20 times.  When the cops came to arrest her, she fought and bit and scratched them?  Yes.  She's like 90 pounds?  Yes.  We're trying to get the audio.  How old is she?  86.  Oh, my gosh.  She's just nuts, though.  Someone like that is just a bonafide nut.  She's crazy, yeah.  She's an old lady.  She's nuts.  She, when the police officers arrived at her apartment, the five-foot-tall, 98-pound  woman attacked the officer, scratching him, kicking him, and bit his hand.  Wow.  Oh, you know, choppers probably popped out on his hand all drooly. 
[06:12:30]  Ugh.  His hand still smells.  Ugh.  Her plaque.  Like baby powder and efferent.  Old lady mouth.  It should smell like fist.  That cop should have put on a glove and just caved her teeth in with his fist.  All 90 pounds of her.  That's a cute little story.  That's a cute little story.  I would love to hear those 911 calls.  She's not as bad, though, as the younger people that do, because you're 86.  You're obviously a nut. 
[06:13:00]  She's insane.  She's a nut, yeah.  She's just, I mean, she should just be killed.  The Alzheimer's.  That's what I was just going to say.  It was probably that.  What?  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  What?  I think she's right, actually.  I think you're right.  And then say, I said it right.  How do you say it?  Say it first, though.  No, say it.  Say it easy.  Say it.  You might be right.  Alzheimer's.  You're right.  You're actually right.  He's right.  He actually pronounces the Z just because of the Z in the words.  How do you say it?  I'm not going to repeat it.  Why?  You're right.  No, you really are right this time.  Go ahead.  No, no, because you're fucking with me right now.  No, no, not at all. 
[06:13:30]  Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Fine.  All right.  All right.  Any other stories there?  Me or him?  You.  Oh, okay, yeah.  You're the news person.  You were looking at him.  Whenever there's a Z in a word, I just drop it.  I just remove that Z.  There's no need for it.  Let's go to the OO.  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Anyway, Nebraska saves the time for me.  It's a news group I go to.  Alt.heimers.  Sex.  You ever, yeah, you ever go to the OO, look at the animals, or listen to 100? 
[06:14:00]  Go to the OO.  All-timers.  And I have another story.  My last story is for Jim.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Okay.  Police in Peoria.  That's Richard Pryor's hometown, by the way.  It's near my hometown.  Peoria.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Pryor's hometown.  Peoria, okay.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck.  No, Peoria.  Yeah.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Whatever. 
[06:14:30]  Yeah, it's an island in Peoria.  Stop.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck dumbfounded by the first time.  In Illinois?  Yeah, Illinois.  Okay.  Illinois?  Yeah.  No, you're right.  Who cares about the eyes?  It's me, as far as she's concerned.  I can't.  You're right.  Ellen.  Ellen-noy.  Well, anyway, can I finish?  Do you like the elephants in the OO?  Elephants.  Elephants.  All right.  All right, let's start over.  From the top?  Yeah, because we don't have to know that.  We have ADD.  Go ahead.  All right, ADD. 
[06:15:00]  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck dumbfounded by the first prostitution case in  the area, so I thought you'd like this.  Yes.  A 47-year-old Christian school teacher thought her snatch was worth $200.  Yep.  She advertised in an escort ad and was caught by police in her love nest apartment, and a  spokesperson stated that $200 should buy you a hot young call girl in a posh hotel.  So, I thought you'd like that prostitute.  I do.  Prior to Mother, funny bit of trivia, was a prostitute. 
[06:15:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  She was a call girl in Peoria, and his grandmother was a madam.  No.  Peoria?  Yeah, Peoria, Illinois.  Yes, that's why.  Peoria.  All right, Matt from Nebraska has a question for ADD.  Matt?  Yo.  God.  What's up, Matt?  Hi, Matt.  Hey, ADD.  I was wondering, are you wearing satin panties or cotton panties?  What type do you wear?  Yeah, do you wear the satin or the...  You just got me to say the T.  Or the cotton.  Or cotton.  Do you like cotton or satin? 
[06:16:00]  I wear both.  What's she prefer?  Well, it depends.  Like, if I'm out, you know, on a date, the satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Okay.  That is really hard to say.  You like satin.  And then if we're just hanging around, you might use the what?  Cotton.  Cotton.  Cotton and satin.  What a chore to speak.  Cotton.  How do you say satin, Reg?  You say it.  Satin.  God, we all have accents.  We know that, but you just amaze us with yours. 
[06:16:30]  How do you say satin?  Satan.  Satan.  Satan is a devil.  Satan.  Satan.  Satan.  Okay.  Satan.  Give me an O-C-O-D.  Okay.  Very good.  Well, that's satin.  Proper pronunciation.  The O-B-N Anthony Show.  This is a delightful bit, I think.  It's when the boys, as they like to be called, are talking about how your standards for porn  are very low when you're young, and you'll take just about anything. 
[06:17:00]  And they talk about that, and then Norton also talks about the gang he's in, and it  has a special name, the Crips.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Have you seen the new Playboy yet?  With Debbie Gibson?  Yeah.  Yeah, that whole celebrity thing, posing nude, is getting old, and I'll tell you why.  Yeah, it's getting old, but I'll tell you why.  She's fucking hot.  Yeah, but she doesn't show anything.  She doesn't?  She doesn't show, there's no fever shots, but. 
[06:17:30]  Do you see snatch?  No, you don't see snatch.  None at all?  No hair?  No, she has this, like, she has, like, this, what was it, a necklace or a belt that.  The one shot, she's holding a hat over it.  The other one, I think it's, like, a belt or something she's covering with.  Yeah, it's some kind of wacky necklace or belt that just happens to cover the area perfectly.  Clever ways to hide it.  I mean, it's, even still.  I mean, she.  I'll tell you what, I was comparing her pictures to those of Tiffany that came out last year. 
[06:18:00]  Her pictures are a lot better.  Remember the big Debbie Gibson-Tiffany fight of the 80s?  Yeah.  And then, the joke was, you know, which one's going to end up in Playboy first?  Which one?  And Tiffany.  The funny thing is, when Tiffany posed, Debbie Gibson said she would never do it.  Oh, really?  She did say that?  They all say they'll never do it.  The trick is, you've got to do it when you're hot.  Yep.  When the people want to see you, if Tiffany and Debbie Gibson did some kind of a dyke thing  in Swank Magazine in 1985, you know, maybe then. 
[06:18:30]  Well, I agree with you.  Because I was looking at the Debbie Gibson spread, and yeah, she's really hot and stuff,  but it just annoys me.  Because, you know, Playboy gets these has-been singers and actresses, and they get them  to pose by saying, look, we'll do very artistic photos, and they'll be more of an art thing  than, you know, porno.  Playboy stinks.  I mean, Debbie Gibson, she's not really a has-been.  She's been big on Broadway still.  Man.  So what?  So is Naked Lane. 
[06:19:00]  You want to see him naked?  Playboy blows.  Dude, like I said, a has-been.  Trust me.  She'd rather be selling, you know, hit albums.  I mean, you really want to see-  You know, every time you hear one of those songs, you're going to spring wood now.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Later.  He's chatty.  They have this phony sense of, like, legitimacy because they don't show hardcore.  That's what I mean, and that's what's driving me-  And it stinks.  If they're not showing pink, then they're not really posing for any of these magazines.  But they think that's classy.  It's called being classy.  Hustler is honest about the agenda. 
[06:19:30]  This is what I'm looking at it for.  I want to look like a gynecological, an exam magazine.  You're right.  Filthy.  You're right.  Playboy fills the gap between people that can have that in their house and the poor  sons of bitches that are pussy whipped by their wives that can't have porno in the house.  But for some reason, they've been able to talk their wives into letting them get Playboy  because that's not really porno.  There are articles in it, interviews with politicians, things like that.  And then the occasional naked girl without, you know, hubba-bubba hanging between her knees. 
[06:20:00]  So, you know, it serves its purpose.  And for first-timers, you know, you're a kid, you get your hand on a Playboy, that might  as well be hardcore pornography.  Anthony, not anymore, though.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  And, I mean, you know, you make some good points, but, I mean, Jim makes a good point  about the honesty issue, you know?  I mean, she's still showing her whore side.  I mean, who's she kidding?  Not if you ask her.  Keeps that private so no one can see it.  That's what I want to see. 
[06:20:30]  That's the only thing I'm interested in.  They could cut the head off.  I don't need to see the head.  It's given me such freedom.  The reason I did this was, I don't know, it's an outlet, it's just a freeing experience  from...  Shut up.  The paycheck.  That's why she did it.  Yeah, because she, you know, wants her name in the press again.  All these people that do this.  They do it for the check and the publicity.  It's just an, yeah, it's just an avenue to get your name back up on top for a little  while.  There you go.  And then maybe someone will pay attention to her latest song or maybe give her some kind 
[06:21:00]  of role in a movie.  That's all.  You know, but to act like it's artistic and stuff, no, you're showing desperation and  you're, you know, you want people to start talking about you again.  Right.  But to sit there, I watched her on all these shows, you know, the shows were, uh, the shows,  the shots were done in an artistic fashion.  Yes, they were.  They're very classy.  Look at this one, you know?  Yes, I'm dressed in orange cloth and saffron.  It's art.  I swear.  So you're right about the honesty issue, you know? 
[06:21:30]  If you're going to do it, you should just do it.  Yeah.  We'll see, um, in the future, I guess, like Christina Aguilera, things like that.  Brittany.  You think Brittany will, uh...  Of course.  Spread them for Playboy?  Yeah, without a doubt.  She might even go to Hustler.  I think Brittany does it before she, uh, you know, starts the down...  The downward spiral?  The downward spiral.  She's already pretty much the has-been, isn't she?  Uh, I don't know about that.  Every day there's a picture in the paper.  Yeah, but as far...  The bob hairdo now, the short haircut.  Yeah.  It kind of stinks, yeah. 
[06:22:00]  No, she wore that for a day.  She's such trash.  I love it.  She wigged out.  Yeah, remember?  She, yeah, we were talking about that last week.  She wigged out for a day.  But that, she threw the wig on just so she could go out.  Yeah.  But I'm not saying she's, she's not still huge in the news and stuff, but as far as a singing career goes, how relevant is she these days?  Well, she threw the Greatest Hits, uh, package out.  Greatest Hits, that's pretty much, uh, that's all I had, people.  That's all I had.  Now here's the Greatest Hits of it, and I'm done.  You go Greatest Hits, then you go Live Album. 
[06:22:30]  Or do you go Live Album first and then Greatest Hits?  I think Live first.  Live first, usually, and then Greatest Hits.  Yeah, because you might need some of the live cuts.  Greatest Hits with that one song.  That wrecks the Greatest Hits album always.  The one no one cares about because it's new.  It's always in the last position because even the artist knows.  It's crap and no one wants to hear it.  It's some, like, just name some stupid band, uh, like Sticks.  Sticks Greatest Hits.  It's like one after another, you know all these songs, and then this last freaking song,  and they're hoping you're going to like something new that sounds like the old stuff with updated lyrics. 
[06:23:00]  They're talking about, like, that's what you want to hear.  A band like Yes puts out a Greatest Hits or something, and they write a new song,  and it's about, like, the internet.  It's like, and it sounds just like a song that came out in 1975, but, you know,  it's about computers and, you know, the new stuff and the Iraq War.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  God, this blows.  Shut up.  Really just awful.  Whining.  Let's say hi to Ted. 
[06:23:30]  Hey, Ted.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Jimmy, awesome show Friday night.  Thank you, Ted.  Thank you for attending.  Hey, I was, uh, I was sitting real close to where, I was sitting real close to where Pat  from who Nats was, and Jimmy introduced him as, you'll know him, he's the guy with the  safety pin in his sock instead of the 10th toe.  Oh, did I say that?  Yeah.  Safety pin in his sock.  Oh, yeah, I said he's pinning it over.  Pin it over like the sleeve with the one-armed gun. 
[06:24:00]  That's what it was, yeah.  Oh, that is funny.  That's very good.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  All right.  Uh, George, what's going on?  Not much, man.  Um, Toy Boy does suck.  When I was 13, I was introduced to porn through High Society and Hustlers.  Oh, High Society was great.  I used to, I used to like Wii.  Remember Wii?  I used to steal it out of a machine?  Yes.  That was great.  That's the porno, man.  Like, High Society, like this guy is talking.  Just skank whores in that one.  You get to see all the, all scabby. 
[06:24:30]  All the pimples.  Yeah, just a mess.  There's no airbrushing.  Big thatch of a patch.  Oh.  Awful.  You definitely work the extra two bucks a month.  Thanks, fella.  Thank you, my friend.  I remember in the hotel that was probably about a half a mile from my house, me and my  buddies used to go, and we had screwdrivers.  We would ride.  They had porn vending machines.  They had Wii and Penthouse.  Porn vending machines?  Yeah.  It was like a holiday inn or whatever, it was like a little local dive hotel, and they 
[06:25:00]  had porn vending machines.  In Jersey?  Oh, yeah.  It was on Route 1 in North Brunswick, and we would go with screwdrivers and jimmy them  and steal the new porn.  Yeah.  And I was such a sex addict, even in like 5th or 6th grade, I couldn't look at it until  I was alone, and I could just kind of like rub myself.  I couldn't look at it with my friends.  You couldn't even look at it?  With my friends, no.  Wow, really?  I never got into looking at porn with my friends.  I would always have to do it alone.  I had a big stash up in a tree fort, and yeah, friends would come by.  It was like a nightclub, you know?  I'd look, no, you, you, you, okay, come on in.  No, you're not dressed right. 
[06:25:30]  Get out of here.  Velvet rope.  We didn't.  Get in the tree fort and just hand out the porno, and you'd look at it.  We had an underground tree fort.  An underground tree fort.  Well, depending on the neighborhood, man.  That's a root fort.  Yeah.  I know, I know.  Well, but it was that same, you know, feel.  It was a huge piece of plywood that we would cover with leaves and stuff.  And, wait a minute, you dig a hole?  Yeah, a massive hole.  And then you cover it with plywood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we had, like, candles and stuff down there, and that's where our porn was.  I like the tree fort better, the high ground. 
[06:26:00]  Well, we had those, too.  I mean, we had all sorts of different varieties of the fort.  Yeah.  The underground one was pretty cool, though, because it was, like, honestly, it was, like, eight feet down.  Really?  Yeah, it was huge, man.  And enough room side to side?  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  Yeah, I'm trying to remember now.  It was probably six by ten feet, probably.  The work you used to put in as a kid to, like, make things like that, and that was kind of easier  because all you needed was the big piece of plywood, but a tree fort was, like, you had 
[06:26:30]  to go out to, like, places where they were building houses and steal the wood and get, like,  your dad's saw and hammer and a few nails, and there you are engineering a place that  goes in a tree.  You needed truss work, and, you know, you have to get up and put those initial cross beams  across the trees.  And they never fell down, you know?  It's like kiddie engineering.  You kind of knew you needed this, and you didn't know where you learned it from or anything,  but you kind of knew how to build this structure that didn't collapse when five guys are up 
[06:27:00]  in there.  I remember amazing.  When I was a boy, we were going to make a gang in North Brunswick.  We were such faggots.  Oh.  And I swear to God, we kind of like, so let's make a gang.  We were going to call it the Lords.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's 1955, Jimmy.  It's atrocious.  Baa-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang.  Hey, I'm Jimmy Robinson, eh?  Hey.  The Lords.  Patsy, over here.  Get under the porch, eh? 
[06:27:30]  Hey.  Uh, monster rain, a-hubble, a-hubble.  But no, they were going to build a fort, and me and my friend, like,  We're so lazy.  We said that we would volunteer to go to the hardware store and get the letters because  we were going to write our gang name.  Oh, my God.  Your gang name?  On the front of the little hangout place.  And that was what we, me and him, went and picked out letters.  Letters.  F-A-G-G-O-T-S.  Oh, please.  We had, like, instead of a door, just a big piece of orange cloth that we could walk through. 
[06:28:00]  Which of fruits.  The lords.  All the way from your purse.  Yeah.  To your last dying day.  We're the lords.  When you're a jet, let them do what they can.  You've got brothers around.  You're a family man.  You're never alone.  You're never disconnected.  Honk, honk.  You're home with your own.  When companies expect it, you're well protected.  Here come the lords.  With the capital J, which you'll never forget.  Till they cart you away. 
[06:28:30]  When you're a jet, you stay.  Oh, my God.  The lords.  The lords.  I can't wait to see whack bag for the pictures they're going to make of that one.  Go to Photoshop on whackbag.com.  Oh, how many leather jackets they're looking for on Google Images right now.  We were, like, in seventh grade.  Just tools.  Oh, complete idiots.  Why the lords, though?  I don't know.  I mean, why would they go to build something and let me and my dumb friend go pick out letters?  I mean, there's no real reason for it.  We're homos.  Who are you, Kinnicky? 
[06:29:00]  We're all over the ball field today.  Let's say hi to Tony in Miami.  Tony!  What's up, Jack and Screech?  What's going on?  What's up, Tony?  Hey, hey, listen.  The first thing I was exposed to, of all porn, I was, like, eight.  My brother was, like, a twisted ass freak.  Kids are usually, like, playboys and hustlers.  He had Puritans.  Do you remember that porn?  Sure do, yeah.  Puritan was, like, the hardcore ass fucking porn.  And my brother had, like, a huge, like, fucking pile of Puritans. 
[06:29:30]  And one time I rubbed one out and I left one out, I guess.  And I went downstairs and my mom's this little old German lady, right?  And I guess she found it and she's like, hey, found something in your room.  And I'm like, oh, shit.  And she goes, that's a hardcore porn!  So she started, like, freaking out and she just, I'm punching out.  Peace.  Oh, he didn't even let me get to the crash.  The best part was we all just started looking at each other like, what? 
[06:30:00]  What's going on here?  I'm hitting buttons, tearing up for the crash.  I'm just waiting for him to stop and hit the crash and he punched out.  He could sense that you were looking for, what are those white things called?  The template.  That he knew you were looking to because it was so quiet he could hear the shuffle of the papers.  See, that's a punch out.  You can't punch out when you're done.  Some people get the crash and they go, all right, I'm punching out.  It's too late.  You're a ditch in the ground.  Mike from Jersey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, good.  I got a good story.  Down the road from my house when we were kids, there was a piece of road there. 
[06:30:30]  People used to flip stuff out the window all the time.  So occasionally you'd find a magazine on the side of the road.  But there was one day in particular that we were riding our bikes down the road, a friend  of mine and I, and we saw a magazine over on the side.  It was probably about a football field away.  So we both raced as fast as we could to see who could get it first.  We both got it at the same time.  We wound up getting an old flight over who's going to get to look at the magazine first.  It was kind of funny.  You could rip it in half.  Hold on.  And trade.  It was pretty funny.  It was actually Cherry Magazine. 
[06:31:00]  I don't know if you guys remember that one.  I certainly do.  I remember Cherry, yeah.  However, that wasn't funny.  No.  Just to clarify, it wasn't funny at all.  Just to let you know, that wasn't really a funny story.  But it was interesting.  It didn't crash me.  No, it wasn't bad.  No, it was good.  West Virginia checking in.  It's John.  Hey, John.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, John?  Hi, Jimmy, you beefy tits.  Hi, John.  Let's not be insulting now.  It's Valentine's Day.  Hey, I was eight years old.  My dad introduced me to the two best pornos, Porky's and Roadhouse.  I'm punching out. 
[06:31:30]  Porky's and Roadhouse.  You know what magazine stunk?  Easy Rider.  That trash laying around.  What the hell was Easy Rider again?  It was that biker magazine, but it had naked chicks in it, too.  But they were the skankiest biker whores that you'd ever, ever see.  And it was like the...  I mean, if you're jacking it to the Sears catalog bra section, you know, it might be good  because it's probably a little better than that to jack to. 
[06:32:00]  But just those awful biker chicks.  Great.  Can you start with, like, National Geographic, though?  No.  Always Playboy.  Started with Playboy.  Yeah, but you couldn't just get your hands on that when you were really little.  Let me think.  National Geographic might have been...  You know, you might be right.  I mean, you graduate up to the porn magazines, you know, because National Geographic, you start  realizing that they're just awful naked women in there.  Yeah, well, it was, you know, the African women.  At first, it was just the, oh, my God, naked women.  Then you have to go, you know, you're jonesing for more and more. 
[06:32:30]  And then you eventually get up to the real porn magazines.  But you have to start somewhere.  National Geographic.  And with me, it was National Geographic.  Or going through the dictionaries and stuff and, I don't know, just finding...  Oh, you'd have to find wherever you could, yeah.  Wherever you could.  Dictionary.  Well, that's a bad example.  Whatever.  Medical books.  Yes, you know, any type of books that the parents had around the house, you're leafing  through, hoping to, you know, catch a glimpse of something.  You find a medical book and, like, thumb through it and find a picture of a woman with her eyes 
[06:33:00]  covered over with a black strip so you can't tell who she is kind of a thing.  And, you know, it's a whole thing on psoriasis or something, so she's naked with psoriasis,  but she's naked.  That's exactly what I'm getting at.  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.  And then you eventually...  You'd have to find whatever you could.  Yeah, and then eventually you'd start figuring out how to get your porn magazines.  It's like a thalidomide woman.  She's got little flipper arms, but she's naked.  You know how I got my first porn magazines?  I had a paper route.  Yeah. 
[06:33:30]  And I noticed that, you know, people would, like, just leave their paper and their magazines  bundle up for the garbage man.  And, you know, you look through the stacks of that long enough, you'll find a porn magazine.  Yeah, they put them in the middle of the stack.  You know, it took some doing, and you would have to spend maybe a whole afternoon literally  going from house to house.  You know, I had scissors and everything, just, you know, cutting the rope that was tied around  it.  And every once in a while, I'd hit pay dirt.  Kids just do not understand how lucky they are today with the internet. 
[06:34:00]  It is amazing.  I mean, years ago, you did.  You had to, it was like a treasure hunt.  You were just hunting around for a photo, anything, one picture of a nude woman.  I remember my first porn movie.  I was, I'll never forget it.  My buddy was an Indian fellow who lived across the street, and his dad had a VCR back in  those days.  A whole cinnamon lip.  Yeah.  They certainly were.  And his parents hated me.  But, you know, back in those days when there were very few VCRs, and I went and watched 
[06:34:30]  a porno with him.  We sat on the floor of his dad's room and watched The Fur Trap with Kelly Mint, and it's  an awful porno.  The Fur Trap, huh?  I had to walk out of his room and lay on the bathroom floor and whack my bag.  Really?  You were just so worked up.  I was laying on his parents' bathroom floor in these Indian people's house with my head  on the tile, scrapping all over myself.  Now, to this day, whenever he smells curry, he explodes on his stomach.  I just couldn't handle it, though.  I could never watch with other people and enjoy porn.  When I was a kid, once we found a super 8mm film. 
[06:35:00]  Oh, my God.  Porno film.  How old are you?  Dude, it was years ago.  It was before, yeah, before friggin' VCRs, like the mid to late 70s, and had nothing  to play this time.  That's when your parents dropped you off at your friend's house with a horse and buggy?  I mean, what year are you from?  Jesus.  It was a long time ago.  So now our quest, we had to find a super 8mm projector. 
[06:35:30]  You knew it was porno, though?  Yeah, because we unraveled a little bit of it.  But, yeah, how much can you get looking at a small 8mm film?  So, I mean, we were ready to tear the whole thing off the reel just to get each individual  picture.  But I said, no, let's try to get a projector.  Finally ended up going to my alma mater, John H. Glenn High School, and telling one of the  AV teachers that we needed it.  We have a film about, it was something about history, we said, to help us study for a big 
[06:36:00]  test that was coming up.  And they let us sign out a projector.  Went to my friend Frank's house, who lived right around the corner from the high school,  set up the projector, and watched porno on the school's movie projector.  Oh, I know.  And it was just threading it through, and finally you turn that on, and seeing porno  like that, the worst 70s big earth mama muff, bad washed out color film, but it was great. 
[06:36:30]  Pay dirt.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Hard to get your porno.  Did you go to any of the porn theaters on Long Island growing up?  Went to one.  Bayshore, I think, was one of them?  Yeah, Bayshore was the one.  Yeah, I went to it when I was working at some place.  Dude, we went just as high school guys.  We'd drink beers, and then pay our admission and go in there.  But you felt so like, you know.  You had to go with a bunch of guys.  Oh, yeah.  It was like a night out.  But there was a bunch of perverts in there and all, but it was like, yeah, this is a  cool thing to do.  We'll drink a bunch of beers on the way over, and we'll go to the porno theater. 
[06:37:00]  Yeah.  We went with a bunch of people from work once.  We just decided, yeah, let's go to the porno.  We went down there, Bayshore, sat down, and just laughed our asses off watching the porno.  But it's like any other place, like even a strip club.  You get the group of guys that are friends there to drink beer and glance over at the  girl, but then you get the guy in the corner that's just drooling and telling the girl  that she looks like his daughter and giving dollars and stuff.  There are certain classifications of guys.  Yeah.  The naive guy that just keeps giving his money away.  The guy that thinks he's going to get something. 
[06:37:30]  The only black guy in the white strip club.  The old guy.  You know?  So you get those groups in the porn theaters, too.  You're listening to O.B.A.  Anthony's Best Bits Ever.  So don't go anywhere, because there's more.  Unless you need to go and make a duty, then you can go for two minutes, but then you've  got to come right back.  O.B.A.  Anthony's Best Bits Ever of All Time.  The bestest.

Dump the body in the river or bury it in Jersey?  Let's bury this one.  Last one we dumped surface too soon.  Fine.  I'll get the shovels and the lime.  Uh, let's use your car.  I just had mine washed.  You know, I'd love just one weekend that didn't involve getting rid of a corpse.  Ron and Fez.  On XM 202. 
[06:40:00]  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Norton's Clef Palette.  A caller calls in with an obvious speech impediment and that's all Jimmy needed to go off on a rant and trash this guy.  It's One's Best Bits.  Brian, what's up?  It's Brad, O.B.  What is it?  How you doing, man?  Briano?  Brad?  What is your name?  Brad.  B-R-A-D?  Yeah.  Brad.  Brad.  I'm crippled with a high palate.  You have a Clef Palette?  Yeah.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Do you have an awful, like, Dave wants that mustache to not hide it? 
[06:40:30]  F you, Norton.  Would I?  Would I?  You have a...  Hair lip!  Hair lip!  Do you really have a Clef Palette?  Yeah.  So what...  Why are you getting mad at me for just teasing you?  I know you probably have, like, a thick, awful mustache, which has, like, a scar in the middle of it,  because all Clef Palette mustaches...  Like Cheech.  ...have that lightning strike in the middle?  What did this guy do to you?  I'm not against him.  He called up and said, I have a Clef Palette.  What am I supposed to do?  Pretend it's kissable?  Is it all fixed?  No, no.  Wait a minute.  You didn't...  You never got it fixed? 
[06:41:00]  We don't have straight teeth and stuff, but it's not...  No, it's not fixed.  Do you know what would help that?  If you put one end of a shotgun on it, and your toe on the other end...  Shut up.  So bad.  Blow that bad lip off and have them put some wax ones on there.  Guys, I want to put what I learned today.  All right.  What did you learn?  I learned nothing, because it's too effing early over here.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you're in Sacramento.  It's very early.  Okay, very good.  Thanks, Brian.  I'm sorry I teased your freakishly misshapen lips, sir.  Make sure you listen to the replay.  That's going to start in, like, ten minutes, I think.  I'm sure nobody notices when you're face down on the pillow. 
[06:41:30]  Holy shit.  You don't even know this guy.  Why would he mention that he had a cleft palate?  Yeah, that isn't something you just bring up in conversation.  I could kind of hear it, because cleft palate people always talk.  They're just trying to hang on and talk properly, because half of their gums are hanging out.  There goes the cleft palate audience that we were trying to get.  We're losing the cleft palate audience.  I don't want you and your fucking horse gums listening.  You'll never work with Joaquin Phoenix for as long as you live.  That's right.  And the other one, what's his name?  Kareeb.  What's his name?  Stacey Keech.  Stacey Keech.  There's another one.  And Cheech.  Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, cane. 
[06:42:00]  Stacey Keech.  Stacey Keech.  I didn't know Joaquin Phoenix had that.  Oh, yeah, you can tell.  So he was yelling, help, help, while his brother was breakdancing in front of the Viper a few years ago.  Fucking faggot name.  It's a J, not a Y.  It's Joaquin.  Why are you so...  Help, help, help.  Why are you so worked up today?  V-lip motherfucker.  I'm tired and my nose is stuffed. 
[06:42:30]  Help, help, help.  He can't breathe.  Help, Neil, take a straight down to you on the sidewalk.  You're going after the easy targets today.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How can you not?  Everyone in Pittsburgh has a cleft palate.  Awful city.  I had nine people on every show with a fucking improv.  I didn't know this was a touchy subject with you.  How can it not be?  Because if he's a cleft palate, we're supposed to go, hey, you're brave, facing your injury. 
[06:43:00]  Ugh.  Wow.  You know what you should do if you have a cleft palate?  Move to Alaska because it's night for half the year and people won't see it.  Jesus Christ.  I got to build an igloo.  I live in that.  Ugh.  Awful.  Oh, my God.  What would you do if you brought home a girl and she had a cleft pussy lip?  You'd punch her in the stomach and kick her out.  You wouldn't talk to her like she was an equal. 
[06:43:30]  Stupid knife slash on the face lip.  Fuck off.  He's hurting me.  He's hurting me.  Oh, my God.  Imagine having to kiss that.  Like, this is a kiss.  But his kiss is probably this.  Like that fucking half an awful kiss.  Can I make out with the right side of the left tonight?  Holy ass.  Oh, that's got to be awful.  Who punched you, son?  Oh, nobody.  I was born this way. 
[06:44:00]  Ugh.  I'm sweating.  Where does this come from?  Always have to be careful you don't make B or P sounds.  I'm a good boy.  I'm a good boy.  You're a good boy.  What is that?  Where does this come from?  What?  He really has a cleft palate problem.  I've known him for a long time.  Where did I just think of a cleft palate?  I saw a guy.  It was at a Starbucks.  I was buying coffee one time.  The kid behind me.  Starbucks?  Yeah, Starbucks.  I want anything as long as you don't speak. 
[06:44:30]  Just nod.  Just nod.  If you have a cleft palate, what you should be is a bank robber because it's acceptable  to put a bandana across the lower half of your face.  Bank robber in the 1800s?  That should be your perfection of choice.  Oh, wow.  You know what they should say?  This should be every bit of dialogue in a hospital.  Mr. and Mrs. fill in name here.  Your boy slash girl was born with a cleft palate and the parent should respond, so how did 
[06:45:00]  you euthanize it?  Not to break it up, look at Ozzy's daughter's tits.  Oh, my God.  Is that Kelly?  Wow.  Kelly Osbourne's tits are huge.  That's good.  Those are fat tits, though.  They're fat tits.  Yeah, but that's, you know, she still has youth with her, so it's okay. 
[06:45:30]  Not really, man.  She has a good eight inches of cleavage.  Yeah, but she's wearing the low cut, so you're not paying attention to how awful the rest of  her body is.  Yeah, but look at the cleavage behind Ben's head.  Did anyone else notice that only the fat girls dye their hair like that?  No, you want to take the attention off of the...  Exactly.  Fat girls like to dye their hair crazy colors so you don't notice how fat they are.  So, she's going to...  That's a cute face.  That's not a bad suggestion.  So, by the way...  Those are nice. 
[06:46:00]  Those are nice, though.  Ugh.  Nord, how much would you love to bang her just to say you banged her?  I would love to, but I also want to throw out the suggestion.  I don't want to say the name again, but if you're one of these people walking around with  an unpleasant split lip, dye yourself from the neck down a color like pink or yellow so people  don't look at you above the shoulders.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So, this is when Norton hurt his foot.  There was a panel underneath the console and it fell and it hurt his foot because it fell on the foot. 
[06:46:30]  Well explained, asshole.  ONA's best bits.  But it hurt his foot.  We know.  Classic rock.  Classic rock that really rocks, everybody.  The home of classic rock.  That's the new one.  Classic rock that really rocks.  Really rocks.  Oh, there's other classic rock out there.  Do they really rock?  I'm not sure.  They really rock.  Let me take a look at my list here.  Here's Harp with Barracuda.  Those radio, and I've worked for all of them, so, you know. 
[06:47:00]  But I always thought it was such a stupid thing.  The home of rock and roll.  And all the other rock stations in your area.  They're not the home of rock and roll.  No.  We're the home of rock and roll.  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot.  That fucking thing fell again right on my fucking foot.  This could be a problem.  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed, and it just fell 
[06:47:30]  on my fucking bad foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot, and it just fell on it.  Don't laugh.  I'm talking.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He's got one of those.  Why did that fall again?  He's got one of those bad.  Why did that fall again on my bad foot?  He's got one of those bad foot pieces.  Dude, I've got a foot on my foot because I have tendinitis, I have arthritis, and I 
[06:48:00]  have ligament damage.  He's got an old man foot.  And right on my goddamn foot, that's the third time that fucking thing has fucking fallen.  Third time.  Holy shit, is that aggravating.  Anthony and Jimmy are very serious, and me and Bob can't stop laughing.  It should not have fallen.  And again, right on my foot.  Holy shit. 
[06:48:30]  I saw his face.  He just heard that freaking whack.  Scared the shit out of everybody.  And then you look at this.  Did scare me, man.  Don't look like a stress doll.  Somebody squeezed his gut.  And then he just snapped.  I got a foot thing on my fucking foot.  Look at his foot.  I got an arm thing on my foot.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing he has to wear.  It's a big foot thing.  I have enough problems. 
[06:49:00]  He's going snowboarding after the show.  I'm trying to avoid surgery.  Yeah.  And I have stage four damage.  I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery.  And I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  How did that happen?  I want to know who fixed that.  Are you on the AZT for the stage?  Why was that not fixed?  No one fixed it.  It wasn't fixed.  Holy shit is that irritating.  It was fixed.  It wouldn't have fallen.  How big was the thing that fell, though?  It's this big.  It's a piece of it.  What is it?  It's solid.  And it falls.  It's probably eight inches off the ground. 
[06:49:30]  Opie probably has fishing string over there.  All right, right now we get it.  Quack.  My fucking foot.  I got a foot of a foot on my foot.  That fucking foot.  I want that fixed.  Immediately.  Right in the middle of my goddamn fucking foot.  It's so...  I'm so...  You're leaving Wednesday. 
[06:50:00]  They'll never fix it.  Do you people think at HBO there's going to be stuff falling?  We're going to lose Jimmy because he's not going to want to come back to life.  Hey, uh, falling on his feet.  Bingo pants has a great idea now, though.  Come on.  Bingo pants.  How you doing?  Hey.  Can you guys put that thing that fell on Jimmy's foot on the auction, too?  Yeah, now it's a famous thing.  It's famous.  It's a famous thing.  It's a thing that fell on his foot.  What happens if his foot goes to stage four, we can just put his foot up there.  Under the console, it's six inches off the ground. 
[06:50:30]  There's like a little shelf, and this is up on top of that, so it's falling from a height.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's not that high, but when the end of that smashes your foot, it hurts.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  And I asked for that last week to be fixed.  There was screws coming out.  I understand.  Whatever, man.  I'm just going to start really being fucking nasty.  When you ask for something to be fixed like that, because it's a physical hazard, why isn't it done?  We have a lot of audio that proves that you asked for it to be fixed.  Holy fucking shit, is that annoying. 
[06:51:00]  Oh, man, but really funny.  It's not like your karma didn't deserve that.  I hate him.  I hope he dies of cancer.  Fuck them.  You die.  Then you have something fall on your foot.  Exactly.  It's not right.  The universe came back and smashed your foot.  Wow.  Holy shit.  You okay?  Don is in New York today, so we'll get it fixed.  Oh, it's all fixed, Travis?  Why don't you just fucking throw it over there?  If they put it up, I'm going to throw it through the window.  What?  Feel how heavy that is.  Can somebody want to weigh that? 
[06:51:30]  That is so heavy.  And what it's got are these little fasteners that aren't working, I guess.  Hey, Ryan from Florida feels for Jimmy.  Let's say hi to Ryan.  A lot of people feeling for you right now.  Go ahead, Ryan.  Hey, man, what the hell's up with that prima donna?  Prima donna?  Dude, I'm sitting here and something falls on my injured foot that I asked for to be fixed.  I didn't say it's painted the wrong color.  It fell on my foot.  Here goes the tear coming from all the blue-collar workers out there that fall off the ladders 
[06:52:00]  and stuff every day and just get up and go back to work without saying a word.  Well, dude, first of all, then, fuck them.  They're cowards.  I didn't walk off the job.  I'm still here.  But what do guys do when they fall off a ladder?  First of all, I didn't fall off a ladder.  Well, if something fell on your foot, that's like, you know, getting a cut or something  on your hand and, you know, I have to go to the emergency room or something for a cut.  Yeah, really?  Is that what it's like?  Stupid.  It fell on my foot.  I asked for it to be fixed.  And let me tell you something.  If I was a painter and I asked for something to be fixed and it fell, I'd complain.  Any painter or any other job would complain, blue-collar or not. 
[06:52:30]  Why nothing ever gets fixed, man?  Well, that's annoying.  You need someone to hold your hand, Jimmy?  No.  It's just annoying, dude.  You're in the middle of something and you just feel it smash your foot.  Yeah.  And it's like you've asked for it to be fixed and it's not fixed and it's like one of a million things he asked for.  If we were working construction, sir, I don't think it would be a problem because it would be something that happens on a daily basis.  When you come in to do a radio show every day, you don't expect to have heavy things falling on you. 
[06:53:00]  Yeah, but Jason from Michigan makes a good point.  I'm going to add to it.  If you didn't throw the power drill away, you could have freaking fixed that thing.  You could have fixed it yourself, Jimmy.  Crawled under there and drilled a few zip screws in.  Exactly.  But you had to throw the drill away because it wasn't good enough for you.  He's a fancy man.  I smell foot diva.  Fancy feet.  Foot diva promo on the way.  The problem is this.  I've been having a serious problem with my foot.  I am worried about it and I'm trying to take care of it.  I'm fucking hobbling around on this cocksucker awful boot. 
[06:53:30]  And I have to worry about sticking my fucking feet under the console and having shit fall.  I would love to get that weight and see how much that weighs.  That really, right on the bone of my foot.  I'd say about four pounds.  Not four pounds.  How did your foot get so screwed up?  Because I had twisted it.  I have falling arches or whatever I have.  My feet are a mess, so I needed orthotics.  Yeah.  So when you have problems with your feet like that, you stand a certain way subconsciously.  You don't realize, my foot really hurts.  I'm really, really angry. 
[06:54:00]  Oh, boy.  That's how I messed up my knee.  I'm sorry.  I was still talking about my foot.  Yeah.  Why do you, when you hurt something, though, you have to keep repeating the body part.  Like, my knee, and he's like, my foot, my foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot.  I didn't know what to say.  See how funny this can be when it's not you?  Oh, see?  See?  I hurt my heart.  My foot, dude.  I didn't, it's a foot thing on my foot.  I didn't know what it was called.  Is there a way that during commercials or something you could pull him losing his mind  when that falls?  Because I've got to hear it again. 
[06:54:30]  He lost his mind right there.  Dude, you know what it is?  My foot hurt last night because I had, the bandage wasn't as tight as it has been.  I was trying to get a looser bandage on it, and today, now it's throbbing, and I'm just,  I'm so, I want to kick something.  Not with this foot, though.  What would they do if they had to do surgery, like you said?  What would they be doing to your foot?  They would go, I don't know.  I have, I know on the left side of my right foot, I have, it's a bone problem, and on 
[06:55:00]  the right side, it's a nerve.  I was getting like, I was getting like numbness in my leg for months when I would sit.  It was like a sciatic problem.  This genius doctor I go to, she helped, so far I have none of that leg numbness anymore.  She's fixing me.  Yeah.  She's fixing me.  It's slow, and she puts a medicated bandage on it, but I got tendinitis, I got a little  arthritis, I got so fucked up, so I twisted it twice, never, and now, you guys know how  I was, I was hobbling along since like May.  You're a bad little paw.  I finally got it fixed, and it's like a slow process, but I can't be in a cast, I gotta,  I gotta, you know, whatever, I gotta be out there doing, you can't have stuff falling 
[06:55:30]  on your foot either.  No.  Oh, dude, that's what annoys me is shit happens, but when you say, look, I have a problem with  my thing here, I'm injured, can you not have that thing underneath the desk, falling on  it?  Say your foot.  For the third, I know, you're right.  Say your foot, you jicken, don't say my thing.  We're gonna go, I'm not a jicken, stupid.  We're gonna find the audio.  Halloween.  But I think I, I think I caused that, because someone said something really funny, and I  either hit this really hard, or kicked something under my thing, and I think that was all it 
[06:56:00]  took to, because this thing was barely, you know, barely hanging on.  Well, dude, if you caused it by doing this, that's not sturdy worksmanship.  No.  Worksmanship?  I said it.  Worksmanship.  You're a worksmanship.  I really, I really have never done a real man's work in my life.  No.  I want to get some elbow grime.  No, no, no.  Obi and Anthony's best bits.  Best Jim Alphurst.  Fat belly acres, shut up.  Fuck him! 
[06:56:30]  This next bit is Dragon Wagon.  Dragon Wagon called in, and didn't like XM, right?  Yes, Travis.  And, uh, all the truckers love this bit, so, they're gonna be happy to hear it again.  You know, I saw Dragon Wagon.  Was, was he, uh, fork-knifed, jacked?  Oh, good, got a new flub.  All right.  Well, no, what were you trying to say, Travis?  Something about a fork and a knife, I think you were sitting down having a meal with Dragon Wagon. 
[06:57:00]  And here's the bit.  Let's say hi to Dragon Wagon.  Yeah, guys, you, totally.  What?  What?  You broke up.  We can't hear you.  You totally offended me today.  You, we totally, we're talking, I was an over-the-road truck driver, and this dude-a-thing that you're all talking about is ridiculous.  What are you talking about?  The what thing, sir?  Did you take an antihistamine before you call next time, clog-nosed idiot? 
[06:57:30]  It, it, it, it, it, you guys are disgusting.  I mean, you know, I turned it on, I'm calling XM and complaining about this channel.  Oh.  That's all of this to it.  Really?  Yeah.  What, what, what don't you like about the channel?  Well, you guys are, are hacks.  You wouldn't be Howard Stern.  I mean, you know, it, it, it, it's, it's immoral what you're talking about.  You know what you should do, sir?  Before you, right after you call XM, you should drink a fifth of Old Grandad and then drunk drive into a schoolyard.  No one cares about you or if you're offended. 
[06:58:00]  Block the channel, stupid.  It's an XL channel.  You can block it.  That's why XM has that.  You need to F you.  That's what you need to do, okay?  I'll hang it up.  Hey, good.  Hang up.  Cancel XM and drop dead.  Let's not go that far.  All right.  Don't cancel, don't, don't cancel XM.  Go to listen to XM Kids or something.  Yeah, go, yeah, exactly.  Maybe that's the wrong thing to say in front of Eric Logan.  And this guy, now he's listening to himself.  He's, he'll be listening.  Listen, I'll go into serious radio.  Good, go to serious radio. 
[06:58:30]  There's a fucking dog for the thing.  They stink.  You're going to have to drive a truck to have serious.  Throw it in the back of the truck, you fucking hick.  Die.  See, get in front of me.  I can run you over.  Why don't you fucking blow your nose before you call a national radio show, you crank-doing  jerk-off?  Now he's listening to himself.  Of course he is.  Yeah, he'll, he'll, he'll be, uh, listening.  Of course he will. 
[06:59:00]  He'll be listening.  He'll call tomorrow.  And he doesn't even have the balls to say, fuck you.  We're uncensored, pal.  You could say, fuck you.  I don't believe in that.  You don't believe in that?  You're a liar and you're a failure.  Well, I'm not a failure.  Yes, you are.  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Why don't you have your fucking sinuses fixed?  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Yeah, all truck drivers are over-the-road, stupid.  They don't go through lawns and pools.  You redundant shithead. 
[06:59:30]  I didn't hear you, sir.  I'm doing drugs and surviving an incest experience.  I mean, he's kind of, I don't know what it is.  Why don't you keep the bottles of them?  Drink a, drink a for the Dragon Wagon.  Is that his name, Dragon Wagon?  It's a Dragon Wagon.  You got your ear on.  We'll bring it back no matter what it takes.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  You sounded like you had more brains on the radio. 
[07:00:00]  Hold on, sir.  Wait, sir.  Is your name really, dude, is your name really Dragon Wagon?  You're a grown man with a name that rhymes?  Hey, slow down with the weird grown-up names.  Yeah, that's a childhood name.  At least it doesn't rhyme.  It's not Mopey Opie.  It's Mopey Opie.  Slim Jim.  And whatever the fuck rhymes with Anthony.  I can't think of anything. 
[07:00:30]  Shmanthony.  Well, if you don't understand, I'm out here busting my ass for you people to be doing  your dumb radio show.  What are you...  How are you busting your ass for us, stupid?  You're busting your ass to put food on your fat wife's table.  We have nothing to do with it.  Well, at least I got a wife and I don't go to bed with another man like you.  I don't go to bed with other men.  If I was, I'd molest your children.  What do you think of them apples, fat boy?  What are you going to do when we stop delivering our roads out of here and you don't have toilet  paper to wipe your nasty rear end? 
[07:01:00]  I don't need toilet paper.  I hire prostitutes to clean it with their hands.  And my father was a truck driver, so I like truck drivers.  It's you I don't like.  No.  You're the type to vote for George Bush, aren't you?  You're the type to...  No, sir.  I don't vote.  I talk a lot of shit and then I sit home on election day.  That's the beauty of me.  But you're the reason the fuel prices are so high in this country driving...  I'm the reason you motherfuckers, you drive a truck!  I have a Saturn.  I cruise prostitutes in Manhattan.  Your food has to get there. 
[07:01:30]  You have fucking 80 gallons of fuel in your vehicle.  I go a month on a gallon of gas.  43rd Street to 15th Street.  Circle for four hours.  Back home.  Why don't you get a Toyota hybrid or something if Dave's Fuel is running around fuel prices out?  Why don't I get a hybrid?  You're driving an 18-wheeler.  Yeah.  But I have to.  This is a purpose.  It's a purpose?  What are you talking about, dude?  What the fuck are you talking about? 
[07:02:00]  You're not this man who's making a difference.  If you died, some other fatso would sit right where you're sitting and go,  Drive, gas, go.  Nobody would miss you.  He could go home and fuck your wife.  She wouldn't even notice it wasn't you.  Well, I'll tell you what.  You just keep on going down with your little radio show.  I'm calling next to him.  I'm making a complaint.  We got this.  The head of programming is right here.  I've been logged.  He's not happy.  I got it.  Dragon wagon is not happy. 
[07:02:30]  I haven't.  Yeah, dragon wagon.  I will pray for you.  We got it.  I will pray for you.  You're going to pray for me?  Do something else while you're on your knees in a rest area, you fucking fat glory hole loving nobody.  I will put you on my church's play list.  You do that.  And then you should fucking hook it up to the church.  I fucked that one up.  Fuck.  You were rolling.  You were rolling without an error for the whole time.  That's all right.  I just couldn't think of the jerk reference real quick.  Oh.  Ah, dragon wagon got me.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper. 
[07:03:00]  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Hey, dragon wagon.  He hung up.  He hung up.  Oh, did he really?  Yes.  Fuck.  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth.  We haven't had one of those jerk offs in a long time.  Isn't it great?  I hope you're listening right now as you're rolling over in a ditch.  Isn't it great?  I love it.  Being on the premium channel, when we were on premium, we never really got those.  We can do no wrong. 
[07:03:30]  As somebody who's been a fan of this show, it's been such a long time since I've heard  one of those calls.  We haven't had one of those.  A guy that has XM, he's going through the channels, he hears us, and of course he's captivated  by it.  He's got to listen.  He can't just turn it off.  There's something about being offended and hating something to the point where you can't  tune away from it.  And guaranteed he's still listening, he will be listening tomorrow, and he will continue  to listen.  Well, and you know what, though, but he gives truckers a bad name. 
[07:04:00]  We love truckers.  Oh, well, of course.  We have a whole channel, Open Road.  I love them.  They're listening to Hank's Place, too.  That's awesome.  I love the Hank's Place.  We're getting all nervous.  Relax, dude.  The truckers aren't going anywhere.  I'm protecting the $12.95 a month.  You know how fast he jumped in when I said cancel XM?  Well, hey, don't get crazy.  It's hasty now.  It's a dragon wagon.  I'll pay for it for a year just so I can hear that again.  I mean, that would work. 
[07:04:30]  Dragon wagon.  I hope he hits an accident and then he's dragging the limbs.  I hope your whole left side has paralyzed you, fatso.  Opian Anthony's Best Bits.  Most Festus Sweeper.

Should I do anything else with that?  No, you nailed it.  Bernie loves the Weekly World News.  Yeah.  Hey, can you believe this?  There's an article, this is a new revelation about history, that the Vikings were sissies.  Actually sissies.  The Vikings were sissies?  And they used that word sissies?

There's a bunch of pictures of dead animals and stuff.  Aw, that's sad.  I can't understand what that is.  That's just for shock value.  There's a crossword puzzle.

This is horrible.  Anyway, I'm going to take this home and read it.

We got the CD.  Bernie!  Oh, he's pissed.  Oh, my God.  Wait, follow him out with the cell phone.  Make sure he knows we never...  It was a fake CD.  No, follow him out with the cell phone.  Opie took a fake...  It wasn't his CD.  Oh, was it a CD? 
[07:13:00]  No, of course not.  And he lost his mind.  Of course not.  Did you get him his CD?  Eric's going after him.  She's going to shoot you now.  Holy shit.  I think we saw some of that rage.  That was that rage.  Yeah.  Wow, that was it.  That was like one of those bad court dramas on TV  where the guy finally snaps on the stand.  Finally cracks him.  The lawyer cracks him.  All right, I did it.  See?  All right, hold on.  I think...  And I'm not sorry.  I'd do it again.  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Jesus.  Bernie, this is your CD right there.  Okay, thank you.  That's not the one he... 
[07:13:30]  Relax.  That's not the one.  That's yours.  Tell him...  That's the one he used in the studio.  Eric, explain.  Explain what we did.  Bernie, the joke.  He had another CD.  Whatever.  It was a separate CD.  Sure?  It was totally...  Take a look at it.  It's not even broken or damaged.  Anyway, it's...  Okay, good.  Why don't you relax?  Why don't you relax?  No, no, no.  I want to go...  It's 9 o'clock.  They want to go home.  They still want to talk to you.  Go back inside and at least...  Let's not burn bridges.  Let's go back in.  Come back in and talk.  He's coming in. 
[07:14:00]  All right.  Wait, that sounds scary.  Hold on.  He's coming in.  They just want to talk to you.  I hope he's building a barrier.  All right, Bernie.  All right, wait.  Sit down, sit down, sit down.  Sit down, sit down.  Let me explain what happened, though, Bernie.  Let me explain what happened.  Wait, put on your headphones.  Let me explain.  Yeah.  Because I don't want...  Explain.  Because we really like you.  We want you to be a friend of the show.  I love Bernie Getz, and I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here.  We felt like...  Here.  I'm listening.  I'm listening.  We felt like you were a friend of the show that we could pull one of our gags on you. 
[07:14:30]  That's all that was.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  Here's the...  Okay.  Here.  I'm going to show you.  Calm down.  Here's the CD of a smash-in.  Okay.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  Here's...  The CD I was smashing was called Haunted Pussy.  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  It had nothing to do with the one that...  You were smashing Haunted Pussy!  You smashed a bad guy!  Bernie, I never touched your CD.  I took this one, and Eric snuck it in, and, you know, made the old switcheroo.  Bernie, we're still pals?  Things are okay.  All right.  Things are okay.  But I'm glad we had the story. 
[07:15:00]  I'm glad we had the story.  I'm glad we had the story.  I'm glad we had the story.  I'm glad we had the story.  A friend of mine.  Oh, I consider you...  Okay, or just, or whatever.  Bernie, look at your CD.  You think it's okay.  Bernie, look at your CD.  It's okay.  Look at your CD.  There's not a scratch on it.  I didn't smash you.  I trust you.  All right?  Don't have to look at it.  I thought we were at that stage in our friendship that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all.  Well, he's smashing your CD, though.  It's like, I mean, it wasn't as bad as what if someone took your kid and said,  I'm hanging your kid out the window like Michael Jackson.  Well, there you go.  That's it.  I know.  There's only a CD.  All right, Bernie.  So we're cool.  We're cool. 
[07:15:30]  And anyway, that's the news for the week.  Thank you, Bernie.  Okay.  Very good.  Bernie gets everybody.  Now that everybody knows what's happening in the world, you know, I hear you.  And it's...  All right.  It's up a few.  Yeah, that was cool in the gang.  That was intense.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now I know what those guys felt on that subway.  I'll tell you that much.  Oh, boy, you got big.  All night and day.  The way you can turn it on.  Yeah.  He really turned it on.  Oh, what a quick fuse.  That's not a slow burn.  You taking the subway home?  Everything's cool, Bernie. 
[07:16:00]  Everything's...  Opie, shut the fuck up!  We're going to be like little Fonzies.  What's Fonzie, Bernie?  I don't know.  Cool.  Oh, yeah.  That's okay.  All right.  Yeah, Bernie, we didn't watch it.  We didn't watch it.  It's going to be a mild winter.  We didn't watch it going away mad.  Is that right?  All right.  Oh, you dropped something, Bernie?  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  That looks like the same speed jacket he was probably wearing back in the night.  All right.  Absolutely.  Good job, Bernie.  All right.  Thank you, Bernie.  Thank you.  Bernie, thank you.  I'll talk to you again soon.  Is this Bernie?  Is this yours? 
[07:16:30]  Oh, yes.  No, no.  It's...  Yeah.  Say again?  Yes, you did.  He was coming back in.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  Dude, that was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  We saw it.  Yeah, Eric was in between me and Bernie, and I got to give Eric a lot of credit, man.  He was holding him back.  He was out of his mind.  You know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man, and when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was 
[07:17:00]  kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman and go, it's not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport, he just like, ah, just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster, and a little smoke billowed up, and he couldn't  handle it.  Right.  Imagine that, O.  You didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just, fuck you, keep your CD, keep your CD, fuck you, and take this with you. 
[07:17:30]  You have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I, I, I, look at me, I'm still shaking.  I am shaking.  Dude, you had a pissed Bernie gets right here in your face.  And there's no reasoning with him when he's that mad.  You can't reason with him.  No, no.  He just walked out.  Yeah. 
[07:18:00]  He was convinced you smashed that CD of his.  That was one of his things.  You see how he was looking for it before you made Like You Smashed It?  He came over to Opie's area, looked through those CDs that Opie's got in front of him,  going, there was a CD, I have it, because he needs to know where everything is.  Yeah.  Very particular.  Yeah.  Or there's something wrong with him in the world.  Yeah.  And then he sat back down.  You told him that the CD you had in your hand was the CD in question.  When you started smashing it, the look on his face, that's when he snapped.  Keep your fucking CD. 
[07:18:30]  Rawr.  Wow.  Eric, is he all right?  He's gone.  Eric, you, I have to tell you, you rock.  No problem.  Eric got in between me and Bernie.  Bernie was literally like, what?  He kept kneeing me in the legs.  I'm like, stop.  He's like, give me my CD, my CD.  And I'm sitting here with this hand, trying to cover his real CD so he doesn't see it.  And Opie's just sitting there going, oh my God.  Could you imagine if he's got to go on the subway right now?  Some black guy is in his seat or something?  Oh, forget it. 
[07:19:00]  With an iPod?  Disrespecting CDs?  Bernie, what's the matter?  Hot water burn baby.  Hot water burn baby.  Fucking psychopath.  Why don't we take a break?  We have Billy Burr in studio.  And that's the news for today.  Keep your fucking CD.  I pushed the CD in the case.  It does this when it's told.  It does this when it's told.  You want your CD, Bernie?  Would you?  Wait a minute.  Would you say a great big black person? 
[07:19:30]  We're going to do that.  Let's CD.  Is that track 14?  Wow.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Billy Burr in studio, like I said.  And also we have Joe Rogan's gangsta fag stuff that he wants to turn us on to.  So we'll finally play a few tracks from that next, okay?  Fine.  Keep your fucking CD.  But first, you know, Bernie Getz was talking about how Jesus Christ, you know, drove his  own brother to drink.  He was.  I forgot everything that happened before that snap. 
[07:20:00]  It's just a segue.  Just a segue.  The heart rate's still up.  I know.  That is really, like, exciting.  Poe came in here with the...  He was the second most crazy person in this room.  That look in his eyes.  And he went to grab Bernie, and Bernie was, like, pissed.  Everyone was just out of their minds.  He was in the other room calming down, doing his little...  Oh, doing his calm down procedure?  Did they get video of that?  Yeah, we have it all.  Danny was in here the whole time?  Yep.  He was sitting right there with the camera. 
[07:20:30]  Oh, nice.  Get Danny in here.  I got to see how the video looks.  Did Poe make a wrong turn and go into the production studio first before he came in here?  I don't know what happened.  Did he know the directions to get here to this studio?  The problem is, in his office, there's a delay, so he was hearing it late.  Oh, wow.  Hot in here.  Yeah, he heard the...  It's getting hot.  It looks like rain.  Oh, it certainly looks like rain tonight.  John.  Yo.  Hey.  John.  How fucking crazy are you to piss off Bernie Getz in the goddamn studio? 
[07:21:00]  Yeah, it's not smart.  Yeah, I hope he's an idiot.  Ted Asner's one thing, he's 80.  Yeah, what's Ted Asner going to do?  And that has never shot anyone.  Exactly.  It's not like it's Psycho Patty or anything, man.  Wow, yeah.  Dude, I never expected him to go like that.  I thought he'd get a little pissed off and bummed out.  I never expected him to lose his mind like he did.  All right.  All right, thank you.  Master Paul, you all right?  No, no.  I'm going to talk to Marcelino and I'm going to find out. 
[07:21:30]  What?  What's up?  What's up?  I want to get a patch directly into my room because this delay is no good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's why.  The 15 seconds of...  Yeah.  All right.  My heart is...  It's all good, bro.  You did great.  You did great.  It's good.  But I want to get a patch.  What do you do to calm down, Po?  I heard like you just kind of sit...  Po is pissed off now, too.  Po is freaking right now.  Nothing was going to happen.  If it came down to it, all of us would have piled on Bernie.  We just didn't want to go there.  That's all.  Here's what they call in the zone right now. 
[07:22:00]  Well, plus, there's not many problems in the studio.  So when there is one, you're the security guy.  You don't want to not be there.  15-second delay.  A lot can happen.  I'm sure that he shot those four guys in a lot less than 15 seconds on that subway.  Bernie can do a lot of damage.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you know, no one's hearing it.  Please.  The security guy, 15 seconds after the fact, he's hearing what's going on.  We'll get him a direct patch.  This is what we do, though.  We create major havoc, and the only ones that are enjoying it are you and I. 
[07:22:30]  Oh, I know.  Po's pissed.  Everyone's freaked out.  Ben is on the phone with Washington now.  Why do you say we?  There's one problem in the studio.  There's one fucking irritant constantly hurting and annoying guests.  Poking and prodding a Bernie guest.  Always.  But I'm saying you guys enjoy it, though.  Yes.  Of course.  It was incredible.  Who else was freaked out when he was running for his bag?  Bernie's probably on his way to a pawn shop right now.  Right.  Todd from California. 
[07:23:00]  That man wants to be the mayor?  I know.  Jesus.  He might have wrecked his whole campaign.  I hope he'd be the guy if we had Ted Bundy as a guest.  Let's get some girls in here naked.  Come on.  Bring in the nude girls.  They could give them a laugh dance.  A wading pool pool of mud and a 12-year-old.  Ted, here, hold this blunt object.  Now bring in the girls.  They're all whores, aren't they, Ted?  Come on in, ladies.  Yeah, these girls were bringing in their filthy whores, Ted. 
[07:23:30]  Here's a bat.  We got Ted Bundy audio?  Yeah, that's when he's having sex with his girlfriend.  He's telling her to lay there and pretend she's dead.  What's that from?  The movie.  Oh, the movie.  Oh, the movie.  Which one was that?  Who played him in that one?  Mark Harmon?  Was it Mark Harmon?  Yeah, that was a good one.  I liked the Mark Harmon, Ted Bundy.  All right.  Why don't we play Craig Christ?  Or Ted Bungy, as Bernie would call him.  Could he get one name right?  Al Bundy.  Martin Scorsese.  What did he say? 
[07:24:00]  Raji.  That was my favorite one.  Raji Dangerfield.  Raji Dangerfield.  What a very dangerous man Bernie gets.  Raji.  Ah, keep your fucking CD.  He ran right over, pointing.  Oh, he was...  Oh, was he mad?  He was the irate white man.  He was fucking angry.  Michael Douglas falling down.  Right.  He was falling down.  That was it.  Bernie gets falling down.  I'm like you, man.  God damn.  I'm just like you. 
[07:24:30]  That's every thug's worst nightmare is some bespectacled guy with a pistol who gets mad  that fucking quickly.  Looks like the mild-mannered Easy Mark.  Yeah.  And he just loses his mind.  When he went out and grabbed his bag, his black bag, and put it up on the file cabinet,  I'm like, oh my God, here it comes.  Here it comes.  We're getting the best publicity we've ever had.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  As much as I'd hate to see Opie get shot, what that would do for fucking gigs for the  next year.  Oh, forget about it.  Every radio station in the country would want you on. 
[07:25:00]  That would be huge.  If you pulled through, his record isn't that good.  You know, he shot four guys and none of them died, so you probably live.  So much for that vegetarian angle he has.  Yeah, so much for the vegetarians making you mellow.  Jesus Christ.  Have another piece of broccoli and I'll take some asparagus and...  We have a fucking CD.  Put the CD in the fucking bars.  Oh, yeah.  Enough about the friggin' soy milk and broccoli and soybeans. 
[07:25:30]  Wow.  That was great that we really got to see him do his thing.  No one gives a shit about him running for office.  We want to see you snap and go into a murderous rage.  That's what we wanted to...  That was it right there.  It took four hours.  We wanted to see that.  Four hours of horrible news.  Four hours.  It took four or five appearances.  Yeah, he's actually been on our show about four times, so it took that long to actually  make him snap.  Chris, what's up? 
[07:26:00]  Hey, Chris, what's up, man?  Oh, hey.  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, man.  The best part of that whole shit was as soon as you hear the CD break, you hear Bernie  Guest go, you motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You motherfucker.  He was pissed.  You can just hear him snappy.  Is there any way to pull that audio before the end of the show?  Yeah, definitely.  I want to hear him losing his mind.  I've got to hear him losing his mind.  We'll replay it after the break.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, I want to know what you think he would actually have done if he actually had gotten 
[07:26:30]  to Opie.  I don't know.  He probably would have hit him.  He probably would have hit him.  Yeah, I didn't want him to get to that point, so I used poor Eric as a blocker.  He would have hit you for disrespecting him.  I mean, he used lethal force last time.  Would he have dunked his thumbs into your eyeballs?  That guy would use the gun to drop him.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think he's the...  He doesn't strike me as a grappler.  No, no, no.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Maybe a bitch slap like his...  I saw him walking down the street looking like a raving lunatic.  He had a shovel and he was talking about Vermont.  I don't know what that meant. 
[07:27:00]  That's where the gun's buried, by the way.  That's where he buried his gun.  Still there somewhere.  All right.  Well.  Whew.  All right.  We'll do a...  A lot of people are saying don't lose Bernie as a friend of the show.  No, we won't.  No, he'll be back.  No one else is going to let him talk for an hour about nothing.  Of course.  No one who has advertisers to answer to would allow that nonsense.  Opioid Anthony's best bits.  Best Ramone promo.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Ramone. 
[07:27:30]  This sweeper has AIDS.  Number three.  State of the Union.  Gas prices going up again.  The Opioid Anthony Show on XM.  Hoop.  Hoop goes the weasel.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Hoop.  Ramone.  Give me your sleeve.  Voss takes a call on stage.  The guys find out that Voss actually stopped one of his acts to answer the phone. 
[07:28:00]  So, of course, they had to confront him on this.  It's ONA's best bits.  Got an email here.  Hey, guys.  Just got in from the AnySoldier.us benefit show at the Stress Factory tonight.  Starring little Jimmy Norton and Rich Voss.  Norton killed as usual, but that's besides the point.  Effing Voss.  He's so whipped, he took a call from Bonnie in the middle of his act.  It went something like this.  During his act, he checked his phone once, and as a cover, he had to make a little hacky  cell phone joke.  So, he says, fucking sprint. 
[07:28:30]  They call it that because you have to run to find service.  Waka waka.  Ah, there you go.  A little while later, someone yelled out, how's Bonnie?  She's okay.  She'll be here later.  Wait, who said that?  Why am I answering you?  Who's Bonnie?  Near the end of his set, he couldn't grab the phone hanging from his pocket and get it to  his ear fast enough.  Where are you?  You're in New Brunswick?  No, I'm not bombing.  You're at the train station?  Turns to the crowd and says, how far is the train station from here?  Yeah. 
[07:29:00]  So, then the people in the front row were all trying to give him directions for Bonnie.  It was a giant clusterfuck as people were naming the wrong streets and turns, and Bonnie would  have ended up a statistic in the paper.  So, some dude from the crowd had to get up, go to the train station, and escort her to  the club.  Are you kidding me?  How effing whipped do you have to be to take a call in the middle of your set from your  chick?  Anyway, just wanted to share that with you guys.  Aside from that dignity-destroying moment, he had a great set as well.  Maybe you could get him on the phone today and see how he defends himself.  This is from Lauren. 
[07:29:30]  Did you see this last night?  No, I decided I wanted to be responsible and come home and sleep.  Oh, so you did your set and left?  Had my car jump-started for the second time that night because the battery is dead, and  then I drove home and backed in, and the stupid PR who works at my thing doesn't  understand English.  So, I'm like, look, just leave it running until you back it in.  Oh, no.  He's like, leave, leave, leave, leave.  So, I had to stay in the garage while this little failure backed my car in, and then I  went upstairs and tossed and turned and dreamed of Black Sabbath at my birthday party.  Yeah.  Like a faggot. 
[07:30:00]  That's cute.  Were you wearing a little party hat?  It was awful.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Where's the band?  They left.  Maybe I can dream next time that's my birthday and I'm kneeling in a bathroom and you put your  swamp ass in my face.  All right, well, we got Rich Voss on the phone.  Rich.  What's going on?  Hey, Rich.  What happened last night, buddy?  First of all, Norton goes on, he kills.  Right.  He just destroys, and he does it all the time.  He's such a weasel.  Yeah.  Whenever, oh, I got to go on in the middle because I got to get back home, you know? 
[07:30:30]  Never.  Like, the extra half an hour is going to kill him, you know?  I always close those shows.  It takes a prime, deep prime.  I mean, he kills, he's funny.  He's got a lot of funny stuff.  Don't talk about me like I'm not here, stupid.  I'm right here.  All right.  And the only thing worse than your cell count is your battery.  So, okay, 0 for 1.  Well, but I don't always go on in the middle.  I just, I actually, I had a legitimate reason last night.  At the time, we did a fundraiser at the Stress Factory a couple months ago for Levy, Bob Levy.  Yeah, you know what?  And I went on.  Shut up and listen.  One of our B comic friends, his wife is leaving him because he brings girls on stage and eats 
[07:31:00]  whipped cream out of their answers.  Wait, who does that?  Bob Levy.  Bob Levy.  Oh, my God.  He brings girls on stage and eats whipped cream.  Blue cheese.  Oh, blue cheese.  And his wife is divorcing him, and he can't imagine why.  That's going to be fun in court when that comes up.  I know.  No pictures, right?  So, we do a fundraiser, and Levy goes on, and he kills, but he's filthy.  And Norm's like, I don't want to go on after him.  Can you follow him?  Yeah.  And then I'll go, okay.  You know, he's too dirty. 
[07:31:30]  And Norm, you know.  I didn't say he was too dirty.  No, I didn't.  What would you say?  I never could follow Levy historically in my career.  He's the one guy I was always, never wanted to go on after.  Well, you know what?  To get over your fears, you have to do things like that.  Well, sorry, I can't host every show like you do.  I'll host.  What are you, fucking Bob Eubanks?  Every show you do, you want to host.  You're right.  I want to host because I know how to do a show, stupid.  So, last night, he goes on, and he destroys.  It's this really funny fluid comedy.  A lot of stuff about his fluids and different diseases. 
[07:32:00]  Sure.  Destroys, right?  So, I go on after him.  Sure.  Right?  And, you know, I do an hour.  No problem.  You know, you can follow.  I mean, you can follow that kind of humor.  You just do stuff with punchlines and stuff, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, where are you from?  Yeah.  I didn't work at the time.  Stuff with punchlines.  No.  What are you drinking?  Well, I'm not to interrupt you, but I'm sorry I had to get out of there.  But I was running late.  My cell phone wasn't working, so I had to sprint for service. 
[07:32:30]  Or did you have to check your RSVP list to see if Black Sabbath is coming to the party?  That's a true story.  All right.  I had a little dream.  Yeah, you had a little dream.  Black Sabbath must have been really upset that they were all wet on in the face.  I can see upset little Jimmy in his dream that Black Sabbath wasn't at his party.  They were at the party.  MTV threw me a party.  Yeah.  And there was a special treat, and then Sabbath left.  Did you tell me you had to leave the party early because you had to get up for work?  Sorry, but anyhow, so... 
[07:33:00]  I don't like the fact that you almost named somebody in Sabbath and realized you couldn't.  I know.  I forgot the guy's name.  Sorry, guitar player.  I can't believe you grabbed that one.  Wow.  So I'm on stage, you know, and I get a phone call.  Now, my girlfriend is coming from New York on a train, which she's never done.  Okay, she's from Canada, and she was coming from New York from her Letterman audition when she got the show. 
[07:33:30]  And, you know, I never took the train from New York to New Brunswick either.  So, you know, I get a call on stage, and I kind of thought it might be her.  You know, New Brunswick is in a place you want some little white girl walking around.  And she got off, you know, off the train, and I said, where are you?  You know, I was wondering.  Look, I was already at 50-something.  This was during your act, though.  I don't really have an act. 
[07:34:00]  Thank God he's finally admitting it.  Oh, Jesus.  And, you know, this is way before, you know, I was going to say, you know, you can get my new DVD to the audience.  You got a new DVD at richfoss.com?  Yeah, yeah.  And I guess the first people I thank on the DVD is my good friends Opie and Anthony, who, you know, I don't call in the morning just to thrash them and trash them because their girl calls them.  So she called, and I said, you know, I tried to get her directions, and people got up from, you know, the audience and started walking out to go find her. 
[07:34:30]  Not to help me because she's hot, you know, and they thought maybe they have a shot in three blocks.  So, you know, one guy goes out, and then she tells me some guy comes up and goes, I'm a cop.  You know, he shows his badge, and, you know, and they walk her over to the, and the sprint joke is not a hacky joke.  That's a funny joke.  But I didn't say it was hacky.  I don't know.  Whoever called in or wrote in, you know.  But now we're getting a lot of people that are saying you're kind of pushy-whipped now with Bonnie. 
[07:35:00]  Well.  Do you blame him?  Jesus.  Well, but what do you mean?  You know, finally a guy, you know, a guy is happy with, you know, this time with a girl.  And, you know, it's not like I, you know, yeah, I don't know if that's what you would call it.  I'm just, you know, I'm a good boyfriend.  You're not a good boyfriend or a good friend.  You're not a good anything.  You're a creep.  No.  Although, I'm kind of caught in the middle.  As one of Voss's best friends, I'm kind of caught in the middle between being, because she is really hot, and they get along great. 
[07:35:30]  And, look, they're a good couple.  But I'm caught in between being happy for him and wanting to smash his face.  Yeah.  When we're going to Albany, the phone keeps ringing, because they're in love.  It keeps ringing, and he keeps answering it.  I'm like, could you be a fucking guy for once?  He would just answer the phone every time.  I'm in the middle of telling a great Hummer story, and how the guy reacted when I gave it.  As we're driving to Albany, he goes, can you be a guy and pull into this rest area? 
[07:36:00]  Here's the thing.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Hi, poofy.  Yes, Snookums.  No, just driving with Jimmy.  Okay.  No.  I love you, too.  Oh, hold on, Jim.  Hold on.  We're at mile marker five.  Hi, Snookums.  But, Rich, the problem is...  Wubby, wubby, wubby, you, too.  I just realized that, you know, my relative is really, really sick, and... 
[07:36:30]  Hold that thought, Jim.  Hold that thought.  Good improv skills.  I say my relative.  Could I have a pick one?  My relative.  Well, I'm really concerned.  One of my ancestors.  It stinks.  My kin is ill.  National comes. 
[07:37:00]  Wow.  Richie, wove you, too.  Richie, biggie, wove you, too.  Oh.  Hey, Jim, remember the time I was getting a blowjob, and you were dogging that chick in the...  Oh, hold on, hold on.  No, lover, you're the only one in my life.  My forever girl.  You're my forever girl.  You complete me. 
[07:37:30]  Oh, Jim, you're getting pulled over.  This is a good opportunity for me to take this call.  I understand why you do it, Jim.  Why you do it, Voss.  She's a very attractive, very nice girl, and I don't even understand for a second why she's with you. 
[07:38:00]  I just don't get it.  That's why he answers the phone.  He's afraid if he doesn't answer, something's going to happen where she realizes what an ass she's dating.  Like, the phone's ringing for her, and she's like, why am I even with this guy?  Like, he's got to distract her right away.  Oh, let me get that immediately.  He doesn't even let the ring finish.  Oh, hold on, yes.  Hello.  Oh, honey.  Is that you, darling?  Yes, baby. 
[07:38:30]  Oh, baby.  Oh, honey.  Oh, man.  Is that you?  Don't hang up.  I'm here.  You know what the sad thing is?  When it rings, her picture comes up. 
[07:39:00]  I put that into my phone.  You're kidding.  I swear to God, her picture comes up.  It's the same ring right now that you're doing.  I'm getting really scared that she's really calling right now.  Oh, my God.  Hold on, guys.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, Voss, you rocked.  You met her at the roast, right?  We met her at the roast, and she's a lovely girl.  And she's funny, too. 
[07:39:30]  And, you know, what are the odds?  Listen, Norton's my best friend.  When me and her have sex, I definitely think of Norton's tits, right?  Voss, let me tell you something about Bonnie.  We felt guilty.  We talked about the roast the next day.  And I were just looking at her boobs the whole time.  And we felt kind of creepy, you know, because it's your chick and stuff.  It's your chick.  But they were, like, falling out of that dress.  She was wearing something very low-cut.  You don't think I dropped a couple loads on my chest thinking of your girlfriend? 
[07:40:00]  And then I'm thinking, you know, God, she definitely saw me looking at her boobs.  I couldn't help it.  Really?  Oh, my God, dude.  She was just so hot at that thing.  Jeez, Opie, relax.  It was so ridiculously hot.  Opie just had his head in his hands going, oh, my God.  It was just like, wow.  Well, maybe you can get some his and her rollerblades and take her to Central Park.  No, baby!  Don't listen to what Opie has done that.  But I did feel like we felt like creeps. 
[07:40:30]  And I discussed it.  We were walking back to, you know, like 57th Street talking about your chick's boobs, man.  Well, you had to look at something.  You couldn't see the stage from those awful seats we got.  Oh, God.  The seats that Voss got us for that roast?  Yeah, thanks, Voss.  Well, I'm surprised you didn't take pictures of them, Norton.  I did.  They were in a celebrity seat.  I did.  I got pictures of how far away we were, actually.  Yeah, I got that.  I got that picture, too.  We should put it up on opiananthony.com.  All right.  I got what?  It was the Donald Trump roast that we went to. 
[07:41:00]  And our seats were...  We were special guests of Rich Voss.  Yeah, and as we were going, we just had to keep walking upstairs.  Like, no one else had to go upstairs.  They were all on the floor.  There were literally, like, ten tables upstairs in the balcony.  No, but here's the deal.  You didn't have to be stuck amongst all those stuffy people down there.  Oh, right.  And who were actually seeing the roast.  Yeah, who were we with the party people upstairs who were looking at the monitors?  God forbid we're actually in the building.  If you would have had quarters, you could have looked through one of those big viewfinders  and saw the stage from where you were.  It could have been a Bill Cosby roast from where we were. 
[07:41:30]  I had no clue.  Donald Trump?  What?  Who was that?  I wanted to hug Robert Klein.  Thank God I had enough quarters to put in the viewfinders so I could see the stage.  That's what I just said.  I know.  Thank you.  Well, okay, so I have every now and then a bad one.  Here's the deal.  You know, you're telling nothing against the wall.  Here's the deal.  First of all...  Those...  Hold on.  I said, I got a call.  I said, I got a call.  What do you call it? 
[07:42:00]  Do you know what those seats cost at that roast?  Do you know what?  You know what?  Who's the first people I said to get into the roast?  My pal Norton, my pals Opie and Anthony, and I'll throw my family in.  I cut my sister loose to get you guys in.  Really?  Yeah.  Thank you.  She bothers me anyhow.  It was a lot of fun.  All right, Father.  It was all right.  All right.  I got to get back up to bed.  She's calling me.  All right.  Why don't you go back to bed?  This was a very successful call.  Hey, do you guys want to have sex live on the show today? 
[07:42:30]  What's that?  Do you want to have sex live on the show today?  Oh, it takes me an hour for the pill to kick in.  Leave with that one.  Leave with that one.  Just walk away.  Just walk away, sir.  We'll do that one day.  Really?  I will.  Of course I will.  He will.  I will.  Dude, you talk to her right now and make this happen because it will be the funniest thing  I ever hear.  Are you serious?  Yeah, it's satellite radio.  We got a couple from California. 
[07:43:00]  They're going to have sex next in a few minutes here.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  It could be really funny.  Would she be up for it?  I doubt it.  I mean, I would be, and I could fake it.  Of course you would be.  Can I just jack off on your show?  She's not into it.  You could just watch her and whack off live on the show.  That could be funny, too.  Oh, God.  Standing by the foot of the bed, just jacking it, whispering so it's not to wake her.  Roll off.  Roll over. 
[07:43:30]  Shred and Reagan are calling soon.  They're good guys.  Hey, are you playing a bowling alley in Suffolk County next week?  Is that where I'm at?  Oh.  Hold on.  My phone's ringing.  I don't know where I'm at.  I don't know.  If they pay me my money, I'm there.  Can someone pick up my girl?  All right, Bob.  All right.  I'll talk to you guys.  If you want to call back and have sex, do that, all right?  Put the producer on the phone. 
[07:44:00]  The producer?  His name's Ben, you ass.  Oh, no.  You Hollywood ass.  Who else called me?  Huh?  Somebody else called me.  Was that Ben?  It was Eric.  Oh, it was probably Eric.  It was Eric.  Yeah.  Know the players, bro.  You've been a friend for years.  I know.  I don't know the new guy.  Put the producer on the phone.  You don't know the new guy.  I don't know the new guy.  Eric's cool.  It's Eric, Ben, and Steve.  Can I speak to Rick?  All right, boss.  All right.  See you, Rich.  Very good.  It is, Rich.  Very good phone call from Rich Voss.  That was funny.  That was fun. 
[07:44:30]  It's O.B. Anthony's best sandwiches.  I mean, bits.  Best bits ever.  It's O.B. Anthony's best bits ever.  There's more of it, so don't go and play any games.  I'm not allowed to be alone.  XM Satellite Radio presents Left Jab with Mark Walsh and David Goodfriend.  Molly.  From Take 5.  In our jab room versus broad-minded.  Psychological profile.  Yeah.

The nation's top teams have made it to this point.  It's a doubleheader on Monday, January 2nd as the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame battle the Ohio State Buckeyes 
[07:46:30]  in the Tosteos Fiesta Bowl at 4.30 p.m. Eastern.  Immediately following, it's the Nokia Sugar Bowl between West Virginia and Georgia.  It's the BCS on ESPN Radio Channel 140.  XM 202, the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is E-Rock Radio coming at you with O&A's Best Bits.  This one's called Sexual Harassment Audio.  Real funny stuff.  And it reminds me of the time I was running around my house with the mayonnaise underwear on 
[07:47:00]  and I had my roommate try to lick it off.  Enjoy.  A lot of Christmas parties this time of year and a lot of the companies warn their employees about sexual harassment.  Yes, they do.  A lot of that happens around the holidays.  As a matter of fact, I read an article recently about England.  In England, some company was putting out a whole thing on Christmas party etiquette.  What not to do.  And they had to write things down like no grabbing women's tits.  If you have to write that down.  Like people are just going around, jolly good. 
[07:47:30]  Hey, bird.  And then another one was no copying your posterior or genitalia on the copy machine.  Doesn't that seem like a Christmas party thing to do, though?  Little lights passing over those small, pale English genitals.  But is anybody looking at that going, oh, we can't do that?  I thought a good uncircumcised picture of my rotten little colonizing dick.  I thought you'd like my imperialist war-making cock.  I love the British. 
[07:48:00]  They've done nothing but can rule the world for the last 200 years.  I can't tell if it's an ugly English vag or their gums.  Their scurvy gums.  Spot of tea, then.  Sexual harassment audio, Anthony.  Yes.  So, yeah.  A lot of people have to go through this.  It's a big thing when you get a new job at a big company.  One day, they set aside and you have to go and sit and listen to lectures and watch films. 
[07:48:30]  And it teaches you how not to get into trouble with sexual harassment in the workplace.  Let's go to the audio.  You hear about sexual harassment on TV and it makes the headlines in newspapers.  As an employee, what do you need to know about it?  First, sexual harassment is against the law.  And it's against your company's policy.  So, what is sexual harassment? 
[07:49:00]  Linda, you are doing a fine job here.  Oh, well, thank you, Steve.  But, you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.  I'm sorry?  I mean, we're talking about your job here.  There may be physical harassment.  In some instances, the harassment may be verbal. 
[07:49:30]  Word around the office is you've got a fat cock.  Yes, I do.  I've got a fat cock, too.  Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.  Maybe a little oil.  Two fat cocks.  Together.  Oil.  It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings. 
[07:50:00]  Sexual harassment is not always about sex.  It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.  Man, I could go for a power fuck right now.  Change is slow.  And what was acceptable in common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment. 
[07:50:30]  Smells like vagina in here.  Excuse me?  Smells like fresh vagina in here.  Are you talking about my vagina?  Maybe.  Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect.  Treat your coworkers with the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.  It's your company's policy, and it's the law. 
[07:51:00]  There you go.  Why are you laughing?  I think we taught some people something there.  Yeah, it's a public service announcement for our listeners, you know.  This tape came right from Washington from Lawyer Lady.  This is what they're playing down there in Washington at the XM Satellite Radio facility, Anthony.  Of course.  They take sexual harassment very seriously.  Yes, they do.  You could tell by listening to that.  A fat cock.  A fat cock.  One guy around the office has a fat cock.  I can think of someone from Sirius that can't wait to get a new job here.  All right.  Relax.  Wow.  Let it go. 
[07:51:30]  So you lost $50,000.  It's no big deal.  I hear you've got a fat cock.  Jesus.  He can hold a grudge, can't he?  Mm-hmm.  And a fat cock.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, it's Travis, and this is the infamous poker chip bit.  This is a girl and a guy, I believe, came down from New England to deliver the lesbian couch  and brought some poker chips along.  And Opie decided to...  I don't want to ruin it.  Don't.  Probably one of the most uncomfortable moments ever on this program. 
[07:52:00]  And funniest.  And funniest.  Absolutely.  Mm-hmm.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Norton was just lying on the lesbian couch.  It stinks, huh?  It's fine.  It smells moldy.  I'm just tired.  I don't care.  All right.  Well, I like the lesbian couch.  Thumbs up to the lesbian couch.  It'll smell like...  It has only one splooge stain, so that's good.  That'll change up.  Were you trying to give her a thumbs up through the window? 
[07:52:30]  Did you notice that?  How revolting was that?  Thumbs up.  And she did...  I'm with you.  She's just staring into space.  She's not even looking at you.  No.  I'm not trying to make up for smashing her gift.  I just kind of tossed it to the side, and then it's shattered.  I don't know.  It's ceramic, and you broke it on purpose, and you giggled.  You're an awful person.  All right, well...  Your aunt's doing nothing but trashing those awful 1951 poker chips.  Yeah, see, that's the difference, though, man.  What?  Why don't you say what you were saying during the commercial break, how much I hate your  poker chips.  I said...  And wish I had balls like me.  That these days... 
[07:53:00]  Those chips stink.  Nowadays, you can get chips that are the same chips you play with in Vegas.  You know who uses chips like that?  Third graders.  Yeah, these chips are...  They need a little weight.  They don't have any weight.  Right, they need some weight.  These are the plastic chips you used to play with with, like, your junior high buddies.  They're awful.  You'd steal them from your parents and play poker.  They are awful plastic chips.  Give her the chips back.  Yeah, you got it.  Why should I give them back?  Just tell her you don't want them.  You might have to, man. 
[07:53:30]  Oh, right, that's a good point.  Tell her you don't want her stupid chips.  Why do I have to be part of your rudeness?  Because you're, like, all brave when we're in commercial break.  But I can understand, you know, that...  You hate your gift.  ...that something might suck and I might hate it, but I'm not going to...  And, Norton, what about you?  What?  These gifts stink.  They do stink.  I don't...  I don't want to be known as the bad guy today.  Chips?  A hat box.  The Lucille Ball hat box she bought when she was out with Viv.  She got that from a garage sale.  That little stupid hat in the box.  Yeah.  Now, take it back, Lucy. 
[07:54:00]  Now, Anthony, that's what it looks like.  Call her back in here.  But I understand I can get a bad gift and still be nice and not hurt people's feelings.  Call her back in here and give her her gift back.  Why do I have to hurt someone's feelings?  I will not bow to peer pressure and hurt someone's feelings.  Call her out on her gift.  I will tell her her gift sucks, but I will keep it.  Oh, you will, huh?  Yeah.  Let's see Anthony say that.  You're really not coming back in here.  Are you insane?  Hi, Erica.  I just wanted to say, Opie had a little mishandling of your gift. 
[07:54:30]  He bobbled it a little while he was trying to put it over by his stuff and it broke.  But I have the cards and chips and thank you.  You guys...  I know.  I know.  You're going to tell her.  Throw them out.  You hate them.  I don't care.  What?  No.  Don't bother me.  What?  Are those good chips?  I'm not saying that they're bad chips.  Are they good chips?  They're old.  They're probably from the 70s.  I just grabbed them.  70s Earth Mama chips.  70s Earth Mama Muff chips.  Throw them away.  It would have been cool if it came from Frank Sinatra's house, but obviously it didn't. 
[07:55:00]  You know, they could be worth money.  You don't know.  I don't know.  Well, if they were worth money, you'd be getting married.  You know...  What's wrong with that?  Nice...  That's a really...  That's a genuine wood chip holder, isn't it?  Hey, give me those chips.  I guess that's right for my face, Steve.  No, look...  Give her...  Give Opie the chips.  Look, I'm just thinking...  I like them.  I really do.  But I'm thinking maybe somebody else could use them more than I could.  I'd be more than happy to take them and throw them in the trash for you, Anthony. 
[07:55:30]  I'm not going to throw them in the trash, but perhaps somebody could use them more than I could.  I'll take them back, Anthony.  Just give them to me.  Tell her.  She's yelling.  Tell her.  I'm trying to be nice.  What do you mean someone...  Why am I being yelled at?  You play Texas Hold'em.  Why can't you use those?  Well, they're just not quite the type of equipment I like playing with.  What kind do you like playing with?  They're chips and cards.  Well, different cards and different chips.  People play with different types of things.  Yes, sir.  I'll pass it back to Steve.  Give her the chips.  You can just Opie give those to her. 
[07:56:00]  It's heavy.  Yeah, these are the cards that are still...  There you go.  They're all wrapped up.  See?  They're still wrapped.  They're all wrapped up.  You ever play 52 cards pick up?  Oh, gee.  Opie.  There's no reason I eat the cards at her.  Did the cards hit you?  Did they?  Opie, did that cards fall off her sleeve?  Come on.  No.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, my God.  Opie. 
[07:56:30]  Opie.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Opie.  Don't video tape.  Oh, boy.  Now clean it up.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  I am mortified.  Oh, Eric called.  She spilled my chips.  I'm not mortified. 
[07:57:00]  I knew you'd do stuff like this.  You're out of the thing.  She spilled my chips.  Oh, God.  You're guinea bread.  Now clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  Oh, my God.  I'm mortified.  I apologize for the other half of this program.  Don't apologize. 
[07:57:30]  I don't really care.  That is uncalled for.  That was uncalled for.  I hope you got a good laugh.  I hope you got a good laugh.  God, he's still immersed in it.  He's trying.  He can laugh all day.  I can't even talk to you.  That is horrible, man.  I knew from the start it was a bad idea to bring those in in the first place.  I should have just brought the couch and be done with it. 
[07:58:00]  That is horrible.  Look, I didn't have a problem with him or anything.  Oh, for some reason, I don't understand why he's got to be like that.  Oh, my God.  It hurts him.  I apologize for the actions of some of the people on this program, you know.  I will enjoy picking up your poker chips. 
[07:58:30]  Um, thank you.  You guys can finish your show and talk about me and do whatever you want.  I don't care.  All right.  There she goes.  Hi, guys.  Wait, wait.  She's walking away.  Wait, can you take these?  Oh, look.  She's getting her.  She's not even going to sit back down.  She's getting her stuff.  Oh, my God.  There she goes.  Ben, go smooth things over.  Ben, smooth things over a little bit. 
[07:59:00]  Remember when Rick had to smooth things over?  Guess what?  Now you're their fucking job.  You wanted to be the big dog.  Go ahead.  There it is.  Yeah, you're the big producer now.  Go fix that.  That is the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  We've broken.  You fix it.  Because the way you threw them and rolled them across the console, it was a heavy thud and  they rolled and all just fell off.  And the chips were flying out and the chip carrier fell on her foot.  It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen one person do to another.  That's the biggest laugh I've had on the show. 
[07:59:30]  I couldn't breathe.  You are an awful person.  I literally could not breathe.  I was laughing so hard.  I don't know how you do that.  That just makes me so happy.  Those are things you think about doing sometimes, but no human does them.  But Opie, just stay.  I'll break your bowl.  I'll throw the chips at you.  I'll fling the cards at your face.  These chips have coffee stains on them.  These are awful.  See, now you're brave.  I can't be brave with you.  Holy S, the back of my skull hurts.  I laugh so hard.  Eric from Jersey, the sound of plastic chips raining to the floor is the saddest sound I've 
[08:00:00]  ever heard.  It will be like the sound of the thousands of tears she's going to shed in the car.  Yeah.  Just walked outside with Ben.  Ben's talking to her right now.  Yeah.  Gave her a nice garbage bag full of ONA stuff.  She is bawling, crying.  Oh my God.  See, I knew it.  Here's what she said.  She goes, I don't mind if he broke it.  But he threw it at me.  Oh no.  And she turned her face into the wall near the elevator and that's all you're hearing. 
[08:00:30]  Stop it.  You are horrible.  Cringe radio is back, boys and girls.  It's about effing time.  She threw the chips.  I didn't throw him at her.  Hold on a minute.  I think he's being smoothed over though.  He actually didn't throw him at her.  I'm going to go check now.  I was a very good athlete when I was growing up and trust me, I didn't throw him at her.  Go fix that.  I made it very close.  Go fix that.  Oh my God. 
[08:01:00]  Oh, that's awful.  I cannot, I cannot believe that.  I'm horrified.  All right.  Opie has no soul.  Evil to the core.  Yeah.  That's what they're writing.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  Opie is the effing antichrist.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  I go home alone every day and I wonder why.  Why am I alone?  Jesus.  Can't figure that one out.  You made her cry. 
[08:01:30]  I didn't want her to cry.  She was nice and she tried to be good natured about it.  I know.  She tried to take the ribbing.  It was the loud, the loud chips falling before the thing rolled off the console.  I know.  That was a big bet.  I'm all in.  I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please.  Dude, you've got to read something to the end of some feedback.  This guy, Cody from Buffalo.  Opie put some good force into throwing those chips. 
[08:02:00]  Sounds like some South American ring stick.  No, that's...  All right.  I was horrified during that whole thing.  An update?  Yeah.  Yeah, Ben's calming her down.  Steve's out there.  They're, you know, getting her to breathe and calm down.  And they're going to try to see if she wants to come back in and get her picture.  Yeah, because she wanted pictures and stuff.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Tell her if she cleans up. 
[08:02:30]  Say you're brave without her in the studio.  That's the difference.  I admit it.  That's the difference between you and I.  Say that to her face.  No, I've done enough.  How did you've done enough?  I think I've done enough.  I can't...  I don't know even...  What's going on out there?  It's just, it's not fun, O.  You threw it right at her.  I didn't throw it right at her.  Do we have the videotape?  You didn't get that on videotape?  Yeah, I did.  You got that on videotape?  It kind of rolled on the console. 
[08:03:00]  I kind of just rolled it at her.  Okay.  She had plenty of time to get out of the way.  Oh, she's a little upset.  Yeah, I would guess.  Drove all the way here from Rhode Island.  Used to give something to the show.  Yeah.  Wanted to get her photo.  Oh, my God.  She comes here to give something to the show and get a picture with Opie and Anthony.  Well, maybe she should have gave something to us from this decade.  Who are you to say that her gifts aren't good enough?  You know what?  He raised frankincense and myrrh.  Not a good enough gift, Opie. 
[08:03:30]  We're starting a rule on this show.  You bring gifts, don't get them from a garage sale.  That's all we ask.  You know, Baby Jesus' best gift he got was a song from a little drummer boy, Opie.  That's right.  It had nothing to do with materialism.  It had nothing to do with the gold, frankincense, and myrrh might have been good gifts, but  the little drummer boy's song was the best gift of all.  And I'd have taken that over those last few chips.  All right.  Let me see the video, Anthony.  All right.  Here's the video.  We're looking back at the tape. 
[08:04:00]  She's all smiley.  Steve, I'll need a screening when you're done there.  Oh, my God.  Well, you kind of missed the toss, but you got the aftermath.  I wasn't really expecting you to do that, to be honest.  Oh, gee.  What did you think you were going to do?  Play a hand?  It's like catching a UFO.  You're just not expecting it.  Wow.  Look at Norton.  This is going to be great for foundrymusic.com.  I'm all in.  Show Anthony.  All right.  Bring that over here.  I got to see that.  I think the audio will really help that clip, because you were too close on her face.  But all you see is the chips go flying by her. 
[08:04:30]  All right, well.  All right.  Let me get a look.  All right.  There's Opie with the devious smile on his face.  She's talking.  Still, yes.  Smiling.  Oh, my God.  No.  Well, you see it clearly.  You see the chips flying by on the table.  Yes, Ben.  Not as if we've done enough damage to being in this new building already.  There's people just coming to work, getting off the elevator.  Yeah.  You see this all going on in the hallway and are just mortified. 
[08:05:00]  Oh, they see her crying out front.  Him filming it.  See that?  Yeah.  Not even trying to comfort her.  Could you face it this way when you break down emotionally?  Oh, I'm horrified.  I am horrified.  Yeah, I'm not going to fix this one.  See, this is the type of thing, the barrier that people say, you know, how far do you take  things on satellite?  That's where, you know, I think the line should have been drawn somewhere. 
[08:05:30]  Yeah.  Girl just trying to bring some gifts to the show.  I definitely.  Give me those.  I'll pass.  Enjoy.  What?  Give me those.  I'll pass him to her.  You're horrible, man.  That clip is hilarious.  You can see her face.  I mean, in the background, you can see the chips just flying by on the table.  Look at the construction workers looking at them like, what the hell's going on in there?  All right.  Well.  Awful.  Should we take our last break and then regroup here, I guess?  I think.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[08:06:00]  Oh, that was great.  Why don't you go out and take your picture with her, Ope?  Yeah.  You old fan from the AF days?  She's been a fan since the AF days.  Whatever.  First time in ten years she's going to meet us.  Go buy Demented World and shut up.  No.  She's a nice lady.  Ope and Anthony's Best Bits.  Best Drew Boogie Remix.  Ooh.  Number three.

Hey, this is Danny, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony's Best Bits.  The bit coming up is called Asshole Boston Father, and this is a bit where a kid actually  tapes his father losing his mind because the son was a couple minutes late getting to the 
[08:09:30]  car.  It's quite entertaining audio, and the guys do some pretty fun stuff with it.  So here you go.  Opie and Anthony's Best Bits.  Yeah, I love this.  Asshole Kid.  This is a great clip, and I think it's from Boston.  It is Boston.  Oh, yeah.  This is typical Salvi.  Father and son in Salvi.  Who knows the background of this besides the obvious?  The kid decided to tape his father because I guess his father is a maniac.  Yeah, he's wound tight.  He's pissed off when he's late.  And I think he was purposely late, and his father was just sitting there waiting for his 
[08:10:00]  son.  What a little shit, man.  I saw the kid just rolls tape and just freaking just works his dad.  I'm not getting in the car.  I'm not getting in the car.  What the fuck in the car?  Dad.  Dad.  I'm going to look at time.  Get your ass in there.  Calm down.  Shut your fucking ass in there.  It's 11.10.  It's 11.10.  What time did I fucking tell you?  11.  Get the fuck here.  Dude.  What the fuck time does it say?  What the fucking time is there?  It says 11.10 in there. 
[08:10:30]  It's 11.21.  You think I'm fucking sitting out here for 20 minutes for your fucking ass?  Why didn't you come in?  Fuck you.  You tell me 11 o'clock, you fucking cunt.  Don't waste my fucking time again.  You don't even give a shit.  It's a fucking joke to you, right?  I didn't think you were here yet.  It's a fucking big joke to you.  Fucking happy hour, I'm missing your fucking cunt.  That sounds like every time Bob Kelly has helped me with my computer. 
[08:11:00]  Miserable piece of shit.  This is for all the expecting parents out there.  There you go.  Can't wait for their little bundle of joy.  When they're so cute running around when they're little, this is what they grow into.  They tape you, driving you crazy.  That kid was, what, 11 minutes late?  Something like that.  Jesus, lighten up.  Pops, you fucking cunt.  I'll fucking show you a joke. 
[08:11:30]  You fucking asshole.  He's all talking.  You are so fucking unappreciative.  Unappreciative.  Inconsiderate didn't pop into his head.  You couldn't figure out.  Unappreciative isn't inconsistible.  I didn't see that coming after cunt.  Father probably played baby Mozart for the kid.  I don't think this guy's playing baby Mozart.  That really is a weird group of words to use.  You're a cunt.  And not only, but you're lackadaisical. 
[08:12:00]  What is Ellen doing?  Oh, she's just awful.  It's a carpet and she's jumping face first.  Yeah, what was that about?  What a shock.  You are like a fucking cunt.  You're so fucking unappreciative.  You don't give one shit.  You're in there fucking laughing your ass off.  Where?  Where was I laughing my ass off?  Can you please talk to me, Dad?  I don't want to fucking even see your fucking face. 
[08:12:30]  Why?  Dad, please talk to me.  Because you were cunt.  You were fucking cunt.  Wow.  This is parenting at its best.  He just wants to listen to his socks.  Is that what he's listening to?  Yeah, of course.  It sounds like a baseball game.  It has to be the socks.  I thought it was maybe Pat's.  Oh, maybe.  Yeah, good point.  What time is it?  It sounds like a little fucking...  The next five minutes fast.  All right.  Fifteen fucking minutes.  I'm there five minutes early. 
[08:13:00]  I'm there for 20 fucking minutes.  People kept coming to the window.  You knew I was out there.  No, I didn't.  You can't tell me what I know and not know.  Why didn't you come in and be like a normal...  Why didn't you go outside at 11 o'clock when you told me?  You told me 11 o'clock.  You told me 11 o'clock.  And then you heard that...  You told me 11 o'clock, fuckhead.  No.  You...  I did that last time.  You left the guest waiting outside. 
[08:13:30]  I'm not saying it's your fault.  I'm just saying...  I'm telling you, you're a fucking cunt.  Oh, that's great.  Wow.  This is brutal.  And the son's just egging him on because he knows tape's rolling.  Yeah.  You're a fucking unappreciative fuckhead.  You don't give a flying fuck. 
[08:14:00]  Could you calm down?  Like, really?  Fifteen minutes.  That's pretty insignificant.  Why are you so mad with me?  It's not insignificant.  Yes, it is.  Fifteen minutes.  What the fuck?  This is significant to you.  Sure to you.  Yeah, it is.  You can't.  If I'm sitting out there for 15 minutes...  Fifteen minutes.  Fifteen minutes?  Yeah.  If it's fucking 15 minutes, then I shouldn't be fucking waiting.  You fuck.  Stop grabbing me. 
[08:14:30]  Stupid fuck.  I don't want to click you.  Wait, Dad, that was 15 minutes.  Eleven o'clock.  You don't give a shit.  You know I'm always up at eleven o'clock.  No problem calling me.  Wake me up.  I'll go get you.  Well, I don't fucking mind.  But I do fucking mind when I get away 15 to 20 minutes.  You fucking cunt licker.  Wow.  You dick licker.  I didn't realize he had screwed that up.  Wow.  You cunt licker.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I do that.  Dick licker. 
[08:15:00]  That was completely the opposite direction he went there.  You're full of shit.  I mean, correct.  You were goddamn late on time.  So he...  It's at night.  It's eleven o'clock at night.  Maybe a school dance or something.  Yeah.  He had to pick him up.  I mean, all the kids really got to say is, would you rather I drive home...  Imagine if I got killed on the way home, how you'd feel.  Is that worth 15 minutes?  My life?  Daddy?  He's egging the father on, though, because the father's done talking.  He keeps going, what's 15 minutes? 
[08:15:30]  What's 15 minutes?  Quit grabbing me.  Nothing to you.  That's right.  Nothing to me.  Can you talk to me?  Excuse me.  You fucking asshole.  You don't even give a shit about my fucking time?  Who gives a fuck?  Again, those ladies.  What's this so fucking long?  Why did...  You're telling me?  Okay.  You're telling me.  This wasn't.  You're telling me. 
[08:16:00]  Whoa.  Okay.  You're telling me it was ten past eleven when you left that house, right?  I thought it was.  I wasn't paying attention at the time.  You don't even pay attention.  I made a mistake.  Okay.  You don't even pay attention.  So the world revolves around you.  Is that what you got?  I didn't pay attention.  You told me eleven o'clock.  You told me eleven o'clock.  It's okay.  I'll come pick you up eleven.  I'll say okay.  You told me.  No, I didn't.  You asked Fody what time you fucking...  I asked Laura.  She told me.  No, you just said I told you.  I was kidding.  I'm taking a lift here, Mike.  Yeah, I guess so. 
[08:16:30]  Oh, it's friends in the car, too.  Oh, wow.  Maybe the friend was the one recording.  Maybe the friend was recording.  Yeah, could be.  Tell me which way to go.  Hold on, wait.  No, never mind.  Let's go straight.  Yeah, you thought you were somewhere else.  I think you left off at kind of like it.  Shut the fuck up.  That's how they make up.  You fucking asshole.  You are a fucking asshole.  Dad, you need to calm down, buddy.  Oh, you need to fucking say,  Oh, Dad, I'm fucking sorry. 
[08:17:00]  Oh, Dad, I'm fucking sorry.  Not like that.  You said it just like that.  What do you want from me?  Cocksucker, fuck luck.  Shut the fuck up.  Don't give me shit.  Okay.  You're not in any position.  I have to take all your shit.  You better fucking believe it.  Nope.  I'm not a believer.  I don't know what I'm trying to believe at all.  Fucking whining, crying, little fucking bastard.  I'm whining, son.  This fucking camera's not fucking much.  The kind of liquor, cocksucker, motherfucker is a whiny bitch. 
[08:17:30]  Is that supposed to take a left hand?  All right, you go up there.  I'm going to fucking...  So you're sitting in there.  The movie didn't get all the way.  I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  You don't go looking for me.  I made a mistake.  Fuck you.  I made a mistake.  I don't believe it.  Good.  Then don't bitch about it.  She's not going to make shit better.  I don't fucking believe it.  You knew I was out there.  No, I didn't.  You got shit to go looking.  The girl fucking left.  Her parent come.  She comes running right the fuck out as soon as they come. 
[08:18:00]  They're looking.  She's looking for the birth.  She's looking for her fucking ride.  Take a left ear.  Yeah.  Any call?  She's looking for her fucking ride.  I love the way it's going back and forth.  You're a little fucking cunt.  There's a fork in the road.  Which way do I go?  This is crazy.  Looking for the birth.  She's looking for her fucking ride.  Take a left ear.  Yeah.  Thank God I'm not here.  She's looking for her fucking ride. 
[08:18:30]  I've made it before her fucking ride.  She came in and said, hey.  Did she have it?  Did her fucking parent have to come in and get her?  I'm not her.  I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  Fucking asshole.  I made a mistake, Dad.  Fucking dickhead.  Normal fucking thing.  Drive up, get out, go in.  I made a mistake.  Not with you.  Not with my kid.  No, I can't have that with my kid.  I'm sorry, Dad.  I made a mistake.  What do you want?  I fucking apologize and everything.  If I thought that, if I really thought that it wouldn't happen again, if you said, like 
[08:19:00]  you're saying, you're sorry, I made a mistake, but I know it ain't going to make a fucking  difference.  Right.  That's how I am.  Why don't you fucking accept me?  Book or fuck up with your book.  Should I fucking kill him now?  There it is.  I'm sure it keeps going and going, but that is nice.  That was fun to listen to.  That's a great little relationship.  Best Opie and Anthony freak.  I'll cut off my own eyelids.  Put me on the radio, Opie.  Kill yourself.  Opie and Anthony's best bits. 
[08:19:30]  It's the best bits of O&A since coming to XM Satellite Radio.  We're in the category of best O&A freak, and coming in at number one is Big A.  In this segment, he entertains us with a little bit of karaoke.  It's the best bits of Opie.  And Anthony.  Maybe Andrew will read from Rent Boys before we get out of here for the weekend.  But first, are you ready for your karaoke?  I guess.  Ah, yes.  Yeah, move the microphone.  Well, we learned that he likes to do the karaoke thing, Anthony.  Yeah, who doesn't?  And, you know, I think everyone needs to be in the studio for Andrew's karaoke performance. 
[08:20:00]  Yeah?  That's right.  Yeah, I think the boys, they've been working really hard, and I think they all need a little  entertainment, Anthony.  You're not that shy, are you?  No, he's fine.  Come on, wait.  Do you want to stand up and hold the mic like that?  Probably be better to belt it out, yeah.  Yeah, why don't we get Mars in here to get him a mic that he can hold?  You know, Andrew, it's not like there's over a million people listening right now.  Don't worry about that.  Don't worry about, you know, about 15 guys just staring at you. 
[08:20:30]  It's no big deal.  Hey, do we have a mic for this guy or what?  What the hell's that?  Oh, my God.  I asked for a mic he can hold.  Oh.  What, like Tom Jones?  Yes.  Got to hold.  Yeah.  He's working on him?  Gotcha.  We just need a wire, that's all, just so he can hold it.  Okay, we're taking care of it.  Okay.  And did we get it?  We got to get everyone in the studio to enjoy Andrew singing.  Next time we do this, by the way, we'll be more prepared.  There have to be girls in the studio. 
[08:21:00]  Well, yeah.  Well, this was just an impromptu.  Off the cuff.  My favorite word.  Serenade any chicks.  It'd be nice, right?  No, we'll do.  We'll have karaoke with the freaks of the show soon on the program.  I want Andrew to serenade some hot chicks.  Have Patty sing guests, Opie.  What?  Guests of the show.  Oh, Stalker Patty's a guest?  Yes.  Yes.  Patrick Minaki's a guest?  Guests of the show.  Wheelchair Fred is a guest?  Yes.  Well.  The retarded Laverne Shirley?  Yes. 
[08:21:30]  And others?  Yes.  All right.  There we go.  Are you getting, like, pictures of this?  Absolutely.  For opianthony.com?  All right.  Now, have good mic technique.  You got to be right up on that thing.  Yeah.  You want to put that down or no?  Do you want to put that down so it's not in the way of the...  Yeah, we go.  There you go.  Do you want him to just stand there or...  Whatever he wants to, you move around a little bit because you might want to move.  That's why I'm saying that's what we wanted to have before this.  Yeah, I would move around a little bit.  So you can move.  All right.  Are you guys ready? 
[08:22:00]  Oh, please.  Chomping at the bit here.  This is Andrew, our new creation, the Big A, doing karaoke, the song, Waiting for a Girl Like You.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So long, been looking too hard, been waiting too long. 
[08:22:30]  Sometimes I don't know.  Sometimes I don't know what I will find.  I only know it's a matter of time.  We love someone.  When you love someone.  When you love someone. 
[08:23:00]  It feels so right, so warm and true.  I need to know if you feel it too.  Maybe I'm too strong.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Would you tell me if I'm coming, I'm too strong?  This heart of mine has been hurt before.  This time I want to be sure.  I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life. 
[08:23:30]  I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life. 
[08:24:00]  I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life.  If I'm ready for a girl like you to come into my life.  You're so good.  When we make love, it's understood.  It's more than a torch  Only in dreams 
[08:24:30]  Be this way  When you love someone  Yeah  Really love someone  Now I know it's right  From the moment I wake up  To deep in the night  Nowhere on earth  I'd rather be  Holding you  I've been waiting 
[08:25:00]  For a girl like you  To come into my life  Been waiting  For a girl like you  Loving will survive  I've been waiting  Someone new  To make me feel alive  Yeah, waiting

[08:26:00]  Now  First of all  Why wasn't that  A real karaoke version  That's what I want to know  Why  Yes, Danny  Mm-hmm  I think  Because it's formatted  For a DVD  Like a real DVD player  I think the vocals  Are on a center channel  So if you don't suck it out  And try and play it  Through a stereo system  It's going to end up  Blending in there  Yeah  Wait, what?  Yeah  Exactly  Yeah 
[08:26:30]  Alright, we'll figure that out  You know, this is a  New bit on the show  I think  Yeah, we need real karaoke versions  I think we need to give that  That mix to  Bruce Kelly for the 80s channel  Oh, yeah  Come on  Why not?  Know what the joke is here, by the way?  He's got to do a fast song  Yeah  He has too much time to  To what?  To know what's going on  Stammer?  Yeah  What are some other songs  That we apparently don't have  The karaoke version to?  Did you practice Brown Eyed Girl?  Oh, once or twice 
[08:27:00]  A little bit  You got the lyrics?  Yeah  Oh, yeah  I have the lyrics  You want to try Brown Eyed Girl  Real fast?  I would love to hear  A little bit of that  Well, I see the feedback  They're asking for an encore here  Oh, they certainly are  So guys  Come on back into the studio  Do you have the regular  What version do we have of this?  It'll be sort of like that  You know  Unfortunately  We've got to work with  What we've got today  We'll improve this, though  All right  Brown Eyed Girl, Ant?  Sure  You ready, Andrew? 
[08:27:30]  Yes  Here we go  Hey, we'll be right back to the studio  Hey, when we were low  Days when the rains came  Down in the hollow  Playing our new game  Living and running

[08:31:00]  Alright, calm down, Andrew. Jesus, it wasn't  that bad. Wait, why didn't he hear that?  That was his inner voice there.  Well, uh...  That was...  That was nice. I liked the faster  tempo there. I liked it, too. Yeah.  I liked a lot of times when you'd chop the  unnecessary lyrics.  And you came in with, girl...  Overrated, singing the whole song.  I liked the parts, actually,  where you would sing the line before it even  came out. Yeah. Like, before you  were actually able to... You kind of got a little ahead 
[08:31:30]  of the lyrics. Just a little bit...  Yeah. That's good, though.  Alright. Well,  great job. Great appearance.  Great appearance, Andrew.  Excellent job. Look forward to having you back  again at some point on the program.  There's right now a van in Munaki headed towards  a brick wall. Yeah.  His last crash.  Eh, eh. Eh, what are you gonna do?  Eh, eh. I think this is what we're gonna do with  Andrew next. We're gonna do movie scenes.  Yeah. We're gonna, you know,  team you up with, like, Stalker Patty.

[08:36:00]  This is when John Valby  went downstairs  and played the piano  at the Steinway office.  The very fancy Steinway facility.  Yeah,  and it was  a disruptive experience for all.  Especially when he said cunt.  Yes.  Hey, why is there a homeless guy  walking around  the XM Satellite Radio offices?  What are you talking about,  Ope?  What's going on?  Oh, that's John Valby?  Is he drinking, too?  He brought booze with him.  And the problem is  he didn't bring his keyboard.  Are you kidding me?  I'm dead serious. 
[08:36:30]  That's the whole reason he's here.  I know.  I told him right.  He brought his CD.  What the hell is that going to do?  He told me the other day  he'd bring his keyboard  and then he saw  that we're in the Steinway building  so he assumed  we had a piano.  That's what he just told me  but I think he's  because he performed last night.  We should go do a remote  down with the piano sound.  I'm sure they'd love that.  Yeah, try to set that up.  Set up John Valby  in front of one of those  really nice Steinways  and see the horror  on everyone's faces.  He performed last night 
[08:37:00]  in Jersey.  This show stinks.  We can't get anything going.  Why would we want  John Valby on the air  without his...  We can play his CDs.  Yeah, we can do that.  They're playing him  when we go to breaks.  We need him in here  with his keyboard.  What's he going to do?  Play a CD  and then go,  yeah, that's me.  You know what he told me?  He said he wants  to sing acapella.  Alright, that could  actually be funny.  Not known for his voice.  He didn't bring a keyboard. 
[08:37:30]  Forgot his keyboard.  Forgot his keyboard.  John's got the keyboard.  He just doesn't know  where his van is.  He doesn't know  where his van is?  No.  The best part  about John Valby,  this guy's been around.  He's a legend.  He still drives  this crappy van  to all his gigs  all across America.  He can't find his van?  How about this?  Look for bars  and then look  right in front of them.  For the vehicle  parked to skew.  He didn't bring  the keyboard up  because he couldn't  carry it.  He brought the keyboard  and he just left it 
[08:38:00]  in the van.  What is he doing?  That bag is filled  with booze.  Oh, he's looking  for more booze  and circling  but he doesn't  have a cell phone  to his driver.  So we're going  to have to try  to flag him down?  What does the van  look like?  Maybe one of our  listeners can help  us get the van.  Yeah, it's a  white Ford pickup.  A pickup?  White Ford van.  I'm sorry.  White Ford van.  There he is.  John Valby  holding up his Budweiser.  The king of beers,  yes. 
[08:38:30]  Budweiser,  the king of beers.  We're looking  for his van.  We sent one  of the interns  out to try  and find his van.  He doesn't have  a cell phone  that he could  call his buddy?  No.  Oh my God.  There he is.  John Valby,  everybody,  with his Walt  Disney Studios  sweatshirt.  Yeah, he's got  a Mickey Mouse  shirt under it.  He's got his  Jimmy Buffett hat on.  Jimmy Buffett hat.  Yeah, I gave  up baseball hats  about a half  year ago.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  All right. 
[08:39:00]  Forty years worth.  Hi, how are you?  What's up,  John?  Hey.  How you been?  It's been a while.  I've been excellent,  man.  Good to see you guys  back on the air  or here.  You know,  my FM radio  still doesn't  fucking work,  though.  Well, it would be  XM radio at this point.  Oh, XM.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you had a gig  last night in Jersey?  Yes, I did.  Went well?  Went, yeah,  sold out.  And I guarantee  you haven't slept yet?  Actually, no,  I really did sleep.  I brought a beer  just in case you wanted  to act like an asshole  this morning.  No, no.  No, no.  You can drink 
[08:39:30]  whatever you want.  We don't care.  I want to know  when you guys were off,  what was your favorite  place you went to?  Meatpacking District.  Grand Canyon.  Grand Canyon.  I hope you went  to the Grand Canyon.  This makes for great radio.  I went to the Grand Canyon  on my summer vacation.  I went to Atlantis  in the Bahamas.  That was nice, too.  And I stayed there  for a month.  Wow.  Anything else you want  to know, John?  Anything else that's  going to make everybody  turn off the radio?  Did you sample any  of the local pussy 
[08:40:00]  down there?  The local pussy,  no.  I can't say I sampled  any of that, no.  I had my girlfriend  with me.  Kind of hard to sample  the local pussy  as you so eloquently  put it, John.  God bless you.  All right.  All right.  Well, what the fuck  do you want to do here?  Well, you don't have  your keyboard?  No.  What happened?  Are you just trying  to call it in today?  You figure that we're  all just good friends  and that you don't  need to perform anymore?  Is this like that  Jay Leno thing  when you're a comedian  and after a while,  ah, I'm too good, 
[08:40:30]  I don't need to perform anymore.  I'm just going to sit  on the couch and talk to Jay.  Absolutely fucking not.  Here's the deal.  I could never play  the real shit on the air,  right?  Yeah.  Now I got new CDs,  two you've never heard  with good recordings  of really great material.  Boom.  You can hear it  with the crowd,  the laughing,  the whole thing.  So we're going to do  John Valby karaoke today?  Well, all right.  Can you at least  make your mouth move  and make believe  you're singing?  Dude, we want you  to sing live in the studio.  Yeah, that's like  part of the fun  is watching you perform it 
[08:41:00]  and I have all your CDs  and I love them,  but we want live performance.  Can you do maybe  a cappella or something?  I could.  I wrote a song  just for here.  It's like having  Paris Hilton on the show  and her not bringing  her snatch.  You know?  You want her to bring  that along?  It's what she's famous for.  Because there's nothing  else to talk about.  Right.  Or her name is  Paris Hilton.  Yeah.  And if you want  to fuck her butt,  go to her hotel,  call room service  and ask them  to send up a slut.  Ah, fuck. 
[08:41:30]  How does the second half go?  See, now if the music  was going,  you'd know  what the next line is.  Yeah, I just can't  fuck her up.  I can help you out  with that.  Ah!  Ay, ay, ay, ay.  Jesus.  Your sister's bedroom  has an on-deck circle.  Ha, ha, ha.  How about  your sister brings  rubbers to family  reunions?  How about  to have another beer?  Jesus.  How about  your grandpa  took a dump  in the voting booth? 
[08:42:00]  Do you guys  do political crap here?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we had a  very long political  break yesterday.  We had Uncle Teddy  on yesterday.  Ted Nugent.  Ted Nugent.  Oh, wow.  And his right-wing  Republican ideas.  Uh-huh.  How was it?  Fun?  A lot of fun, yeah.  Some of the listeners  got very upset with him.  A lot more fun  than this segment.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  How about  the Red Sox  won the World Series?  The Yanks  choked four in a row.  I'm doing  Opie and Anthony  to cover my bets. 
[08:42:30]  Next year,  I think that  I'll root for the Mets.  Who's your daddy  now, asshole?  They reverse  the curse  of bad luck.  Now it's  one,  two,  three cheers  for the Sox  because the  Yankees suck.  You know,  there's something  about the piano  that goes along  with that stuff.  Yeah,  all right,  I'll get the fuck  out of here.  Oh, no. 
[08:43:00]  We don't want that.  No, no.  I mean, no.  We just want a piano.  Yeah,  we don't want you  to leave the studio.  Without a piano,  it's just kind of like,  this chick  was sucking  my cock.  Oh!  You know,  without the piano.  Yeah.  We're a little boy.  That's why  you should play  the CD.  All right,  we won't do it.  No,  we can play the CD  going into breaks  and stuff.  You know,  and you really  don't have your piano.  I cannot believe  he doesn't have  his keyboard.  You know,  in New York City, 
[08:43:30]  there has to be  50,000 keyboards  within a mile  and a half  of right fucking here.  You cheap  fucking cocksuckers.  I never heard  of keyboard.  We should have  one on call.  Let's hear another  a cappella song  from John Valvey.  What else you got?  Same-sex marriage,  same-sex marriage,  Bruce and Chauncey  and a baby carriage.  Let me tell you,  brother,  the one with the sore ass  is the mother. 
[08:44:00]  Kelly and Rosie,  Kelly and Rosie,  finger up her pussy,  nice and cozy.  Let me tell you,  sister,  she still can't come  until you fist her.  Bush and Carrie,  Bush and Carrie,  shouldn't have a say  in who you marry.  Tell you one thing  for damn sure, 
[08:44:30]  tonight I'm marrying  my hamster.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Do-ah.  Yeah, there you go.  We'll give you a little  clap for that one.  Hey, sorry guys.  I, you know,  I thought we were  in New York City  and we'd have  fucking shit up here.  A keyboard.  Yeah.  You could usually  just get a keyboard  in New York City  at six in the morning  or seven or...  Hey, I figured...  Oh, Danny the intern's  on the line.  This is XM fucking radio.  All right, hold on.  Danny's right.  Danny's on the line.  He's our intern.  We sent him out 
[08:45:00]  onto the streets  of Manhattan  to try to find your van.  Let's see if we got  an update.  Hey, Danny, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hello, Danny.  You find the van?  Nah, dude.  I'm looking pretty hard.  I'm canvassing  57th Street right now  between 6th and 7th  just on the lookout  for a black Ford van  with New York Place.  I thought it was white.  Yeah, wasn't it a white van?  It's black now.  Oh, many years ago  it was white.  It's a black van.  Okay.  Yeah.  And what's his name  is driving that around right now?  Ronnie.  Ronnie?  So where did you  tell him to drive to? 
[08:45:30]  I didn't tell him anything.  He's going to meet me  at Shelly's at 830.  Well, Shelly's  is right across the street.  Oh, where did he go  for a half hour  or an hour?  Find a whore?  Is he the kind of guy  that might go down  and try to find  a tunnel bunny?  No, he's the same as you  when you go  to the Caribbean.  Oh, gotcha.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  All right.  Thank you, Danny.  You got it, guys.  If you find the van,  call us back.  Absolutely.  So he's going to be  at Shelly's  to pick you up  at 830. 
[08:46:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, see?  You know?  Damn.  Fuck, you know?  Talk to Jim  and fucking  I'll come back  in a few months.  All right.  How about one more  a cappella song?  Oh, fuck.  And where's your CD?  We'll play some stuff  going in a break.  Is this the latest CD?  One called  The Old Fart Cuts  Another One.  Okay.  And Operation Fuck Iraq.  Oh.  All right.  Which song should we play?  Do the second one.  I like the second one there.  They're all good.  What, Best Shot? 
[08:46:30]  Yeah, Best Shot.  All right.  We'll play Best Shot  going in a break.  All right.  These are your latest CDs.  I love the John Valby CDs.  I saw...  Norton was playing Cleveland  and it just so happened  the day before  Valby was playing  and Ronnie gave me  literally...  I don't know.  You have like 50 CDs out.  Well, yeah.  20 or so.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  I got the whole catalog now, so...  So you could hear it  with the music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel really bad now, man.  That's all right.  He's kind of right.  We should, you know,  as a professional studio,  have a guitar,  have a keyboard  just in case people drop in. 
[08:47:00]  Well, just in case people drop in,  we do have the wiffle ball bat  and the drill dough.  I know.  We have a wiffle ball bat  and a drill dough.  And John, we are looking  for someone to break in  the new wiffle ball bat.  And that's your punishment,  I think.  I saw that fucking drill dough, man.  That's awful.  Isn't that frightening?  He doesn't do that.  I know.  Well, we've heard from people  that use that.  Really?  Why don't we get drill dough guy in?  The girls are getting ready.  And as we get the drill dough guy in,  maybe, John,  you could do one more acapella for us?  I think you have one more song in you.  You got one more?  I don't know what the fuck to do. 
[08:47:30]  We could just imagine  you're hearing a piano.  One of the newer songs.  Something maybe that's topical.  Oh, I could do...  Oh, my name is Ronald Reagan.  At the end, my brain was mush.  But even then,  I was twice as smart as George W. Bush.  Ooh, there you go.  Now, that may be sickening,  but here's what's really scary.  George W. Bush  is twice as smart as Carrie.  Who gives a fuck?  You got to do this 
[08:48:00]  with the crowd yelling and screaming.  Of course.  What's going on?  This is the worst.  This is the worst.  Fuck, I got to get the fuck out of here.  This is John Valby  crashing and burning.  I'm kidding.  This is probably your best appearance.  Oh, shit.  Go so far.  We like crash and burn appearances.  Oh, man.  This is fucking painful here.  You know,  I hate fucking radio  because I could never say  what I really think  and all that shit. 
[08:48:30]  Yeah.  And then I finally get a place  where I can speak as I am  and fucking,  it's fucking going in the tank  because I got no fucking piano  in a fucking city  of 50,000 motherfucking pianos  within a mile and a half.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah, but they're owned by people.  Yeah.  Like we got,  we're in the Steinway building.  There's a huge piano downstairs,  but we're up here.  I know.  There's beautiful pianos down there, man.  Oh, fucking A.  And want to break in?  Let's do it.  Like your short talk is cheap.  Let's go down there.  Knock on the fucking door. 
[08:49:00]  Wait, are they open yet?  You should just walk in.  We bring like cell phones down there  and you play your songs right there  in the Steinway building.  Oh, wow.  That could be funny.  What time are they open?  They'd be blown away  if they heard you really play  because he can really play great.  Of course.  That's what you should do.  He's an amazing pianist.  You do one of your things there  and then just when you get them all,  you know, hooked in.  Roped in.  Roped in.  Then you could, you know,  break out the songs.  Break into Gang Bang or something.  Yeah, yeah.  You were talking about ringtones. 
[08:49:30]  No, somebody was talking about ringtones.  Ringtones?  Yeah, you know those things  they put on the fucking...  Yeah, we were talking about that...  What?  What?  Uh-oh.  Dude, all you had to do  was write me a note  and I would have segged  right into that.  Hey, how about those ringtones?  Instead of just pulling it out of the sky.  Yeah, we were talking about ringtones, actually.  It's not that I'm here deep in slumber.  More like I'm cuffing the kinky cucumber.  So at the sound of the tone, 
[08:50:00]  grab your own bone  and pump out your name and your number.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I left my messages on your mother's face.  I like that.  I like that.  And for an actual ringtone  of the little kids walking around,  quit beating your bone  and answer the phone  said Barnacle Bill the Sailor.  Hey, fucking little ding, ding.  I love to hear it  as a fucking ball game.  John, I love it. 
[08:50:30]  Usually makes us laugh  harder than anyone I've ever seen.  His shows are absolutely amazing.  Where are you playing next, John?  Let me see, tonight,  Long Island Governors  and then Connecticut.  It's a BYOP.  Bring your own pussy.  Piano.  Oh, piano.  Yeah, you're going to bring  a piano to your gig?  Yeah, fucking A.  I got two of them  in the fucking truck.  All right, speaking of the truck,  we got Danny the intern.  Yes, Danny.  We got an update  on Valby's keyboard there.  No, this is Eric. 
[08:51:00]  He's looking for Danny.  All right, what's up, Eric?  I'm downstairs by Steinway.  There's people in here.  It looks like they're open.  Good.  Oh, all right.  Does it look like  you'd be able to make  a dash for the piano?  The main piano in the room,  it looks like they're tuning up,  but there's a secondary one  that looks like we could  probably take over  if we ask them nicely.  All right, why don't you  come up and get John Valby.  Let's see if we can get a song  live from downstairs.  Live from Steinway headquarters.  Yeah, from Steinway headquarters.  All right.  Okay, I'm coming up.  All right, good.  All right, we're going to see 
[08:51:30]  if this could happen.  Yeah, that'd be cool.  We can set this up.  Eric would go, it's for the radio.  This guy plays really good.  Don't tell him who you are.  Okay.  Because we've heard you jam.  Just do one of your jams.  Start playing something nice.  And then when you're feeling it,  just break into a gangbang or something.  You're Jonathan Valby.  Tell them you're Jonathan Valby.  Jonathan.  Yes.  Sebastian Valby does.  Great.  Let's get to work on that.  This sounds like an adventure.  Yeah.  And Bob Kelly's on the phone.  Bob?  Hey, what's happening, man?  What's up? 
[08:52:00]  There's just a bunch of Mexicans  in minivans down here.  There's no black Ford van.  Are you coming up?  Yeah, I'm downstairs right now.  Why aren't you coming up?  Oh, I'm just helping this little intern out.  He's running around like a fucking chicken  with his head cut off  looking at every van that drives by.  So I figured I'd help him out a little bit.  All right.  Stay down there  because we're bringing Valby down.  You can help us out with this bit.  All right.  All right?  All right.  All right, cool.  Bob Kelly's downstairs.  John Valby's going downstairs  to the Steinway facility.  Mm-hmm.  This place is absolutely beautiful. 
[08:52:30]  Yeah, this is not a place for us.  Not at all.  It's very nice.  It's about time we got in trouble  with the building, you know?  Yeah.  We've been too nice.  We've been here a month.  Why not?  And there, John Valby's staggering  out of the studio.  Oh, jeez, you totally got him.  He is going to horrify people down there.  If they let him sit down  and start playing,  they're going to be all happy  because he's very good.  And it's going to look all cool  because he's going to play  a nice tune, I bet.  And then when he breaks into his smut...  Jesus, that would be great. 
[08:53:00]  That's going to be awesome.  Boy, he sure needs his piano.  Yeah.  When he starts singing that stuff  without any music at all,  whew, that's bad.  Brutal.  Danny.  Eric, again.  Oh, why do they keep saying Danny  on the line?  Don't know.  Hey, could someone else call?  I want to get, like,  some stereo action down there.  Okay, let me do one of the interns  off the street.  Oh, there might be...  Oh, never mind, Eric.  Yeah.  All right, so what's going on down there?  First of all, set this up for us.  Okay, we're in the middle  of the Steinway showcase.  They gave him the big grand piano 
[08:53:30]  right here in the middle.  Do they know who he is?  No idea.  But they were just tuning the piano  and then removed everything.  So John sat down  and he's tickling the ivory.  That's John playing right now?  Let's listen to what he's playing.  Yeah.  Plays very well.  Yeah, he's just warming up.  He's ready to go  when you want him to.  All right.  Oh, my God.  How many...  Well, let me ask you a few questions.  How many people  are in the Steinway facility there?  Right now, it's John, myself, 
[08:54:00]  Bob Kelly's here,  and just the Steinway piano techs.  How many Steinway people are there?  One, two, three.  All right.  Three people that will be horrified  in a matter of moments.  Yeah, the manager of the place  is just standing there  with his hands on his hips  giving me this dirty look.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  He's just standing there.  The techs are explaining to him  and he's looking at his watch.  Are they all...  I think we need to hurry  and get this done and get out of here.  You better make this quick, man.  Are they pleased with his playing?  Say what? 
[08:54:30]  Are they pleased with the way he plays?  The tech said he does very good.  They just haven't heard his lyrics yet.  No, right?  No, it's strange.  Valby looks like he's homeless.  He's drunk.  And I didn't want to say it  in front of him,  but he smells really bad today.  Like booze.  Yeah.  All right, well, I noticed that, right?  Of course.  Well, let's have him play a song.  What song should we have him play?  Well, Eric.  Yes?  Have him really...  Because I don't think he knows  he's on the air.  Have him jam one of his, you know,  legit things.  Okay.  They might toss him soon, man.  First song you do,  do something really legit just to...  Just for as a quick warm-up. 
[08:55:00]  Make sure he doesn't go too long.  Okay.  Little boogie-woogie.  Very good.  This is going to be great  when Eric gets kicked out  because he will.  Oh, of course.  This is where it's going to get  really uncomfortable. 
[08:55:30]  I was out on a date  in my daddy's car.  I picked her up  in a Manhattan bar.  I finger-fucked her clit.  She didn't let out of me.  I had my cock  in her throat too.  I was humping her face.  My pecker started to spit.  The doctor said  the bitch had an epileptic fit.  There, oh, where can my pecker be? 
[08:56:00]  The bitch bit in my cock for me.  You're a man with two balls and a stump.  You better keep my pecker  when you take your next dog.  And there you have it.  The texas say we need to leave now.  One more.  One more.  Can you do one more quick?  Just one more? 
[08:56:30]  One more?  One quick one?  Can you just do one quick one?  Like a 30-second one?  30 seconds.  Okay, yeah.  Don't allow him to do one more.  All right.  All right, one more.  Okay, here we go.  Live from the Steinway facility.  Blowjobs and handjobs  and eating clitoris  Watching your grandmother  douche with laboris  Brown pubic cunt hairs  and toilet bowl rings  These are a few of my favorite things  Popping bum blisters  at the balls of my ass ass 
[08:57:00]  Taking a shit in my New York Yankees hat  Oh, that was great.  Oh, yeah, I think he's done.  They're ganging up on us now.  They're pushing us out the door.  Okay, we're leaving.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  You guys have no idea  how crazy that was.  That is the classiest place downstairs.  It is like a social club's lounge area. 
[08:57:30]  Okay, we're coming up right now.  All right, very good.  Thank you, Eric.  No problem.  You guys have no idea.  This is one of the classiest joints  in all of Manhattan.  It's a real piano place.  They have these beautiful, beautiful Steinways  all over the place.  It's a showroom of just beautiful Steinways  and he's in the middle singing that crap.  It's a landmark building in Manhattan.  So, I mean, that's a pretty special thing.  Historic landmark.  That is...  I would have loved to have seen their faces 
[08:58:00]  when he broke into that first tune.  God, was that funny, too.  Jesus.  See how much better it is with the piano?  Even over the phone.  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Wow.  You horrified me.  They're saying we have to leave.  They're saying we have to leave.  They're pushing us out right now.  Yeah, we'll hear about that one.  Yeah, we will.  We will so hear about that.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  The terror audio.  Oh, the terror audio, yeah. 
[08:58:30]  That was terror audio.  Jesus.  I'm terrified.  All right.  So, it's the new terror tape.  Yeah.  He's an American, so it's not as scary.  And I think it kind of comes off like, yeah, like backyard wrestling.  The guy just doesn't strike the fear into people like the guy speaking that horrible, savage language does when they translate how they're going to kill us.  When it's some dopey ass from California that didn't fit in, a little misfit. 
[08:59:00]  So, it doesn't, it's not as scary.  What the hell is his name?  Adam something.  Adam Perlman is his last name or something?  Oh, I think it is something like that, yeah.  Sounds like a Jewish last name, although I don't know if it is.  Goldman or whatever.  Self-hating.  Of course.  Self-hating Jew.  Yeah.  And he's, yeah, he's on the America's most wanted list.  Finally, finally being somebody.  That's all that's about.  Yeah. 
[08:59:30]  We've got to interrupt again, Anthony.  Bob Kelly's here.  Bob, what was going on down there?  Oh, the gay guy in the suit walked away as soon as he heard clitoris.  He just ran in the back room and the piano tuners were just cracking up.  It was hilarious.  John Valvey really looks like he could be like a classical player.  He's playing all the classical ones and then the guy in the suit heard clitoris and ran away.  How did it feel down there, John?  Actually, that was one of the best pianos I ever played in my life. 
[09:00:00]  One of the two or three best.  Wow.  Phenomenal pianos.  Steinway, yeah.  Yeah, nice, big, echoey room, you know.  I have no idea what it sounded like.  It sounded great over the phone.  It must have sounded amazing down there.  I haven't laughed that hard in two years.  Right there.  Goddamn, very funny.  Very funny.  I fell over Ben.  We were rolling around the floor.  I couldn't control myself.  When those lyrics popped out, just knowing how classy that joint is.  Oh, it is.  The tuner guy had no idea, had no idea what he was singing.  And I was like, you like that one? 
[09:00:30]  That was good, right?  He's like, oh, that's a good song.  Very good song.  I like that one.  We'll be in the end for these best bits.  Favorite show intro.  Hey, we don't all sound that dumb.  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites  to fight the forces of evil. 
[09:01:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With a cop.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Act, act.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cop.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like quirly spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Ever seen Yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it excites.  Pauketosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  And off with superhuman powers. 
[09:01:30]  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Those quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  It's Opie and Anthony's best sandwiches. 
[09:02:00]  I mean, bits.  Best bits ever.  It's Opie and Anthony's best bits ever.  There's more of it, so don't go and play any games.  I'm not allowed to be alone.  Hello, MyRadioStore.com.

The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, it's E-Rock.  We're in the category of Best Overall Show Segment.  Coming in at number four is Cigarette Ads. 
[09:04:00]  We found some old cigarette commercials that were sponsoring TV shows and cartoons like the Flintstones.  And we noticed that some of these ads here maybe were leaning towards a certain stereotype.  And Anthony took it from there.  It's O&A's Best Bits.  So, Anthony, we got the Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  We mentioned this earlier.  A little earlier, the times they did a change.  And you used to be able to have cigarette ads on television.  And even cartoon characters.  Which now, you can't have a cartoon character hawking anything now. 
[09:04:30]  Or else they say you're exploiting the children, harming the children.  But back in the old days, cigarettes.  What was this?  Winston, I think.  Winston.  Fred and Barney.  They sure work hard, don't they, Barney?  Yeah?  I hate to see them work so hard.  Yeah, me too.  And let's go around back where we can't see them.  Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.  Okay.  How's about taking a nap?  Hey, I got a better idea. 
[09:05:00]  Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got that filter blend.  Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend makes the big taste difference, and only Winston has it up front where it counts.  Here, ahead of the pure white filter, Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially  processed for good flavor in filter smoking.  Yeah, Barney, Winston tastes good like a cigarette chug. 
[09:05:30]  Oh, man.  The Flintstones has been brought to you by Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette.  Winston tastes good like a cigarette chug.  Wilma, Wilma, I've got to get to the rock quarry.  They took my throat out. 
[09:06:00]  I got throat cancer from Winston cigarettes.  Ah, Barney, Barney, could you pedal the car with your feet today?  I'm weak from the chemo.  Ah.  That cartoon's hawking butts.  They show Betty in one episode having to fill one side of the bra with tissue.  She smoked for a long time.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  Why, Betty?  Why, I'm Betty.  Yeah. 
[09:06:30]  Oh, we're going into Silly Zone again.  All right.  Well, there you go.  The Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  That's a little strange.  The voices were a little off, though, right?  Yeah, it almost sounded like Fake Fred.  It sounded like...  Hey, Barney.  Yeah, it sounded like Jackie Gleason.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well, that cartoon was based on the Honeymoon.  Based on the Honeymoon.  Stolen from.  I hated the Flintstones.  Stolen?  Did you?  I loved it growing up.  Jetsons, too.  Hated it.  I hated the Jetsons.  Loved the Flintstones, though.  God.  I don't like Bugs Bunny because there was a viciousness to it. 
[09:07:00]  Bugs was great.  Probably the best cartoons ever made were the old Warner Brothers cartoons.  But now they cut out all the violence when you see...  Of course.  When you see Bugs Bunny now.  All those cartoons were all about the violence.  It's all about smashing people on the heads with frying pans and shooting them in the face with shotguns.  And then they cut it to pieces now.  I'm the Easter Bunny.  Hooray.  Smashing his face on the ground.  Oh.  I loved it.  I loved those cartoons. 
[09:07:30]  Growing up, watched them all the time.  I can't believe you didn't like the whole nastiness.  Never liked them.  Bugs was just a nasty thing.  I liked Bugs Bunny.  Oh, you did?  No, I loved them.  I thought you said you didn't like Bugs Bunny.  No, I hate the Flintstones.  I like Bugs Bunny.  I'm so confused.  No, no.  Bugs Bunny was great, man.  That's the best cartoon.  It is.  Uh-oh.  F and idiots.  Peter from Whackbag.com.  What cigarette did Opie smoke?  Chesterfields?  No, he kicked that habit. 
[09:08:00]  Right in the liver.  A lot of rumors flying around as far as this show goes.  I don't know why.  What are you giving me, Eric?  People love Lost in Space.  Oh, okay.  I see.  All right.  Thank you.  What did you give Opie?  Just cartoon theme songs.  Oh, what is it?  What are you drinking, Ben?  A little water?  Can we get more coffee?  I'm fading.  Yeah, then turn.  Opie wants coffee.  Let's go.  Coffee.  All right.  Well, we have the Winston commercials, too. 
[09:08:30]  You want to try a couple of these?  Yeah, let's hear some of these olden day commercials.  Oh, no.  This is for Newport.  Newport.  Yo, B.  I loves the Newport.  Hey!  Groovy.  Just give me a coffee.  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too.  Isn't that great?  Newport tastes fresher. 
[09:09:00]  Tastes better, too.  This is just conjure up images of walking into the Copa.  Tastes better, too.  Smoking cigarettes and drinking.  Than any other Memphis cigarette.  Walking through the back of the Copa.  Walk through the back.  I think that's about it.  Put the table up front.  I think that's about it.  It's just a jingle.  That one's great.  That music's great, ain't it?  And then this one's for Lucky Strike.  Old Cigarette Ads. 
[09:09:30]  Lucky Strike.  First again with Tobacco Men.  First again with Tobacco Men.  What?  L-S-M-F-T.  L-S-M-F-T.  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Yes, in a cigarette, it's the tobacco that counts. 
[09:10:00]  And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Yes.  So round.  So firm.  So fully packed.  Yes.  So free and easy on the draw.  So for your own real deep down smoking enjoyment, smoke that smoke of fine tobacco.  Lucky Strike.  And remember, collards, use your own water fountain. 
[09:10:30]  Don't these just all sound?  Yes, Lucky Strike.  Smoke them without Negroes around.  After you've run the fire hose on black people, enjoy the draw of a nice Lucky Strike.  Yes, Lucky Cigarettes.  To be enjoyed without the pain and agony of having black people around.  You could walk into a diner that doesn't serve Negroes and light up a nice Strike. 
[09:11:00]  So after you beat your wife, draw on a nice Lucky Strike.  You'll be lucky there are no Negroes in your neighborhood.  Because you're white and live in America.  And you're free not to live near black people.  And smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Ah, the good old days.  That's wonderful.  What do you call a black guy smoking a cigarette?  Um, um, I see you laughed. 
[09:11:30]  I wanted to tell you the answer there.  What was the answer?  I'm not saying now.  You're wrecking the timing of the bit.  You call him Nicotine.  What?  A cigarette.  Nicotine.  Oh, Nicotine.  That's what I said.  Nicotine.  Okay.  Enjoy Lucky's cigarettes.  And enjoy your whiteness.  And the whiteness of your name. 
[09:12:00]  Your family.  Your workplace.  The water fountain.  The buses.  Every place in America.  Strike.  The official cigarette of the back to Africa campaign.  Feel that draw.  The place in America.  And living in a white country.  After you sick the German shepherds on some Negroes.  Enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes. 
[09:12:30]  They're wonderful.  Like white people.  They just all sound like that.  You can tell it's old.  Right.  There's something about the sound you can tell.  There's just that sound of rampant racism in it.  Let's try a cigarette spot for Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair cigarettes.  Now a cigarette that's low in tar and nicotine. 
[09:13:00]  High in menthol flavor.  New Montclair.  Just enough in every puff.  Makes every puff a pleasure.  How much is just enough?  Just enough menthol to please your taste.  Montclair's new charcoal menthol filter does it.  Charcoal granules that are both activated and mentholated release just enough menthol to freshen every puff.  So every puff tastes as good as the first puff. 
[09:13:30]  What's so modern about Montclair?  Modern.  The answer is in Montclair's modern menthol flavor.  Yet Montclair is surprisingly low in tar and nicotine.  But the flavor's still there when you smoke Montclair just enough in every puff.  Makes every puff a pleasure.  Smoke Montclair.  New from the American Tobacco Company.  Mmm.  That sounds good.  More mellow.  Yeah, that's a mellow one.  You want another lucky strike?  We'll try one more lucky strike.  Lucky. 
[09:14:00]  Places all.  All joint hands.  Circle left.  Now circle right and listen to me.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Elementary corners like swinging on a gate.  You're right to your honey with a right to your left eight.  Grand right to your left around you go.  Lucky strike means find a backhoe.  Meet your honey and give her a whirl.  All swing around with your little girls.  Smoke them, smoke them.  Then you'll see.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T. 
[09:14:30]  Promenade and don't you fall.  Promenade around the hall.  Lucky strike is first again.  First again with tobacco men.  Promenade straight down the pike.  It's time right now for a lucky strike.  Yes, first smoking that you're bound to like.  You just can't beat a lucky strike.  Yes, sir.  They're playing that chicken picking music.  I hope whoever wrote that never smoked and still got cancer. 
[09:15:00]  Swing your partner to and fro.  Look around.  No black sambo.  Ah, yes.  Lucky strike.  The wonderful flavor.  Taste the draw of lucky strike as you drop your children off at an all-white school.  No negroes here.  The only place you want charcoal is in your filter.  The charcoal filter of lucky strike.  Wonderful. 
[09:15:30]  That's also the only place you want tar, baby, is in your cigarette.  Not walking the streets of your all-white neighborhood.  Lucky strike.  What a wonderful cigarette.  Good for dining, dancing, or lynching.  Light up a lucky strike.  You could light it off your zippo lighter, a match, or a burning cross on a negro's lawn.  Whatever it takes, light up that lucky strike.  You know why lucky strike cigarettes are so good? 
[09:16:00]  Look at them.  They're white.  That's right.  When have you ever saw a black cigarette?  Never.  Because it couldn't possibly be good.  Lucky strike with their wonderful white paper.  Smoke luckies.  Because we don't like negroes.  Various.  What a time.  What a time we lived in.  I think we have one more for lucky strike. 
[09:16:30]  Lucky again?  I mean, no, let's try a Newport.  Another Newport.  These were boring, though, right?  We didn't like the first one.  I don't know.  It's kind of jazzy.  Scooby-Doo-Wawa.  Smooth and fresh is the important taste.  Never harsh, never rough.  The smoothest tasting menthol cigarette. 
[09:17:00]  Wah-wah.  King size and new deluxe 100s.  Little tune written for a cigarette ad, 1936.  You think she had to kill the cigarette because it was talking to her?  That voice.  Do you notice that the menthol ads are all, have a cool, mellow thing?  Like that was the message that was, you hang back and have a menthol ad.  Right, right.  But the other cigarettes, lucky. 
[09:17:30]  Smoking lucky.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  Of course, Jersey again.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, bitch-ditch?  Hi, John.  I don't appreciate that type of language.  I just want to tell you guys, when Anthony said he was going to stick to German Shepherds,  I almost drove into a ditch.  You guys rock.  This is the part of the program where we allow you to compliment the bit.  Oh, thank you.  I'm tearing down the third wall for everyone, Anthony.  So we could feel a little better about ourselves. 
[09:18:00]  What's that?  What is that, Eric?  I have no idea.  Eric, what are you doing?  A pack of Marlboros.  You ever heard that theory that the Marlboro box was designed like the KKK thing, the hoods?  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's been around for years, that theory.  Yeah, there are all kinds of rumors like that.  Yeah, all right, well, I don't think Marlboro's in cahoots with the Klan.  This is the new and improved Opie and Anthony show, so we don't beat things into the ground.  We'll try not to.  We're going to say cut right there and end the bit.  End the bit. 
[09:18:30]  Bravo to Anthony.  Bit is over.  Coming up with that on the fly.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for the musical accompaniment in there.  Derek, the only time you want tar, baby, is in your cigarette.  That was great.  Richard, Jenny, coming up.  No, I didn't live in those times.  I was saying those were some times.  Guy's like, how old are you?  No, I wasn't around during those.  Yeah, that's right, sure.  It's called a bit, silly. 
[09:19:00]  All right.  Oh, God.  Yeah, me, Burt Lancaster.  We would go out and smoke.  Opie and Anthony's Best Bits.  Most Cringe Moments.  Tippi Tom's first visit since coming to XM made this one of the best bits.  Why?  Because we thought Tippi was dead.  Oh, that's right.  But he may not have been. 
[09:19:30]  Way to ruin it.  No, no, no, no.  He may not have been.  He might be.  But after this, you'll know.  I like it.  Best Bits.  Are you guys ready to wake up Tippi Tom?  Where's the broads?  Well, I don't know where the broads are.  Where are the broads?  Nothing works the right way on this show.  Stuck in traffic.  I like how you tipped your fedora up when you said that.  Where are the broads?  Broads.  All right, where's Keith?  Where's the holes with feet?  We have to make sure we do this right. 
[09:20:00]  We got Tippi Tom outside the studio.  Wiggle those stems in here, dame.  No, Keith, come in here.  Hold on.  Keith!  Keith.  Hold up!  Holy shit, these fucking guys that work for us.  Sometimes they're just asleep.  Those silly geese.  Jesus.  What?  So how are you going to wake him up?  We want to set this thing up here.  You got your gloves on?  Yeah, we'll give him a little stir and see.  Hopefully he hasn't pissed himself.  And you were telling us a little while ago that he gets really nasty when you wake him up? 
[09:20:30]  Yeah, he's nasty when you wake him up.  He's real nasty.  Eric is covering his nose with his shirt.  Right.  I guess it really stinks out there.  All right.  We got Steve, who's filming all this for some videos that we'll get up on opieandempty.com later today.  All right.  It's waking up a belligerent homeless guy.  Keep that over there, the microphone.  He can't be right.  He's sitting on my side of the console.  Make sure that mic is up.  Make sure the mic works.  And test the mic.  Test the mic.  Oh, my God.  And how are they going to hear us?  Test the mic. 
[09:21:00]  The mic's on.  Okay, good.  How can they hear us?  No, but do you have headphones on so you can hear us?  No.  No, of course not.  Why would they do that?  They're waking him up.  They're waking him.  Tippy Tom.  It's Tommy.  Uh-oh, he might be dead.  No, he's not dead.  He could be.  Is he blue?  Tommy.  He looks a little blue.  He's not moving.  Oh, my God.  Is he blue?  He's taking his pulse.  Is he dead? 
[09:21:30]  Oh, my God.  No, I'm serious.  Oh, my.  We could have a problem.  Tippy Tom.  Smack him in the head.  All right.  His ears are...  No, no, no, no.  Don't smack him.  His ears are kind of red.  No, he's...  I think he's alive.  They can't wake him, though.  Wow.  He...  This is a...  Does he have a pulse?  Oh, my God.  He's not waking up.  No, don't...  Don't hit him. 
[09:22:00]  Don't hit him.  He's just smacking him in the fire.  Do you like to try him, Mr. Poe?  He's dead.  He's taking his pulse.  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  You guys really need headphones out there if we're going to try to do a radio show.  Because you don't know what we're saying.  Oh, I hope he didn't kill the homeless guy.  He's the only one we have.  Does he have a pulse?  I think it's a very, very faint pulse.  Oh, my God.  Is he waking? 
[09:22:30]  Steve's got to move a little.  Steve.  How great would it be if he died on the radio show?  It wouldn't be great.  Oh, God.  What is he doing?  Master Poe.  Get a mic on Master Poe.  You know, he's got to be a deep sleeper.  He's passed out.  Yeah, he's got to be a deep sleeper if he's a homeless guy.  You've got to sleep through a lot.  Master Poe, what do you think?  Is he alive?  Yeah, he's alive.  If I give him a couple of pressure points, he may wake up. 
[09:23:00]  But I don't want him to go to the bathroom on the floor.  Yeah.  He is breathing.  Hold a mirror up in front of his mouth.  Yeah, he's breathing.  He's breathing, and he does have a pulse.  Oh, okay.  That's all you need.  If, um...  All right, let's give him...  Oh, Steve's going to, like...  Steve's talking about...  What's he...  No, Steve's trying to snap...  Tippi Tom!  Oh, my God, we can't...  We cannot wake Tippi Tom.  Really, really yell at him.  Not in his ear where it'll damage anything, but, like, get right up to him and just yell, 
[09:23:30]  Tom, wake up!  You know, just wake up.  There's another way to wake him up.  Tippi Tom!  Wake up, Tippi Tom!  Okay, that's that...  Didn't work.  Wow.  Somebody yell...  Come on, Tippi!  Get up, boy!  Don't say...  Boy.  I like the red-headed lady out there who just can't believe this is happening in the  studio.  She's disgusted.  Dude, he's not moving at all.  All right.  Holy S.  How are we going to get him out of here? 
[09:24:00]  Just leave him here.  Let them deal with him later.  Put him in the Frank's place, studio.  All right, what's going on out there?  Someone's got to tell us what's going on out there.  They're pouring water over his ear a little bit?  Yeah.  A little water.  Steve, get out of the way.  There we go.  Turn your head.  I know you've got to film it, but I kind of want to see.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Keith, I need you.  What you've got to do is put your fingers in the water and then flick it onto his face.  Oh, no.  I'll do it?  No.  Please tell me the homeless guy's not dead. 
[09:24:30]  I think he's dead.  Oh, there he goes.  Okay.  That kind of...  Did that get him a little bit?  Did that get...  That's how you...  Oh, he's stirring.  He's stirring.  Tippi Tom!  What's Poe doing?  Poe is brilliant.  He's...  Yeah, we got some fun.  He's alive!  He's alive!  Thank God!  Oh, my God.  Knock you out.  Tom, you ready to do a little more singing?  Wake up, Tippi.  You ready?  Oh, my...  I thought he was dead.  Dude, I'm not kidding you. 
[09:25:00]  I thought he was dead, too.  Just a little water in the air.  Dude, did you all of a sudden have it going through your head, the news and everything?  Yes, of course.  All of a sudden, it was all going through my head, like, oh, my God, the news, we're fired.  Wow!  Wake up!  Are you starting to wake up?  Come on, you have to wake up.  Water on the eardrop.  All right, well, you're up now.  No, you know why?  Some people want to hear you saying...  Water on the eardrop?  I'm not kidding.  We're with Frank Sinatra together.  All right, I need my 15-minute rest.  15 minutes?  It's my business. 
[09:25:30]  It's not yours.  No, no, I know, Tippi, but we need you inside.  I don't bother you when you're resting.  It doesn't bother me.  Oh, my God.  Thank God he's alive.  Thank.  Come on, Tippi.  I can't believe we have to say this on our radio show.  Get the fuck out there and work and come back.  Back me up in 20 minutes.  Yeah, Tippi, Tom, drink this.  No.  Oh, God.  I don't know what you're doing.  Get up, boy.  He's saying no to a drink.  Wow.  He doesn't even want a drink.  No, I want rest now.  So, be my friend and give him my 15-20 minutes. 
[09:26:00]  All right, we'll give him 15 or 20 minutes.  No?  Yes, we should go make him sleep by that lady's desk, though.  Oh, God, no.  Right on the floor by her feet.  Tippi?  He's thinking of the place.  Yo, Tippi.  Come on, Tippi.  We have to wake up.  Not now.  I said 20 or 15 minutes.  I'm going to tell you about my boss.  He's going to be coming in about 15 minutes.  Just get the fuck out of here.  Give him 15 minutes.  I don't sleep 15 more minutes if you want.  I don't...  Give him my 20 minutes. 
[09:26:30]  Now that we know how to wake him up, wake him up?  Yeah.  No one.  He is seconds away from getting really nasty.  No, I didn't sleep for two hours.  Yeah, no, you were sleeping for two hours.  We need you inside, Tippi.  Go on.  Get out of here before.  I fucking...  I told you.  I'm mad.  I told you.  I told you.  I'll bust somebody's head off his motherfucker.  Get the fuck out of here.  Tippi Tom.  What's up, pal?  I know you.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know what I mean, Tippi.  We've been going to have a long time with good friends. 
[09:27:00]  Fuck you.  Give me my rest, man.  You want coffee?  No.  I'll leave.  That's what I'll happen.  And you want to see me.  Give me my 15, 20 minutes and get the fuck out of here.  Come on, pal.  We're going to go inside.  We're going to sing it.  No.  I don't want to wake up now.  You're fucking with me.  Go get lost.  There's this guy here.  He wants to suck your cock.  I ask him. 
[09:27:30]  I don't care.  Nice blowjob.  Get you going good in the morning.  Come on, pal.  Leave me 15, 20 minutes, please.  He's right, man.  Fuck you, man.  They took his head off.  I want 15 fucking minutes, you son of a bitch.  He's a dumbass motherfucker.  He's walking around now.  He's fucking stuck my dick.  Eat my asshole shit.  He's walking out. 
[09:28:00]  Look at the face on her out there.  Look at that mug.  Do we want to keep him or do we want to let him go?  Keep him.  Tell Steve to film her.  He's just wandering around the office and horrifying everyone else that works here.  See the mug on her.  Oh, I know.  Very angry.  She's not happy.  That's right.  Eat my asshole, he said.  Jesus.  It's quite a meal.  You know, I'm telling you, a thick, viscous meal. 
[09:28:30]  We don't...  We tell the truth on this show as much as we possibly can.  I swear, my heart sank.  I really thought he was dead.  I thought he was dead, too.  Because they were raising his arms and his head and there was no...  He was not moving.  There was nothing.  And he kind of had a...  It was just falling.  Purple hue to him.  What's up, Ben?  Eric's on the phone with...  They're talking to him.  He's on the 12 there.  Oh, okay.  Is he near the elevator?  Yeah, no.  He's by the main door.  All right.  Eric, what's going on?  We ran out of microphone cord, but he's heading back, so we're going to throw him back on the mic. 
[09:29:00]  All right.  Oh, here he is.  Keep away from my side.  All right.  He's alive.  And he's awake.  He's coming in the studio.  He's got his fists up.  Here, come on in here, Tippy.  What's up?  Tippy, what's going on out there?  Don't break me up.  I can probably get a little nap.  We need you inside, Tim.  But you're here to perform, no?  I bust his ass.  I thought you wanted to sing another song.  You want to fight?  Yeah, I'll fight you.  We're going to fight.  Hope he's getting up. 
[09:29:30]  I'm not fighting him.  What the dope you want?  You want a bruised nose?  One of those gritty knuckles in your face?  Not even.  He'll just lick your mouth and nose.  End of fight.  All right, Tippy Tom, let's work this out.  What happened?  You're going to get your ass beat.  All right.  What happened out there?  Here's what's happening.  What's going on there?  I have no idea what happened to you.  What's going on?  You're a deep sleeper, by the way.  I was trying to get a little nap.  Okay.  Because, you know, I'm a little sleepy.  A little tired from all the work that you do. 
[09:30:00]  A deep time, a little sleepy, you know what I'm saying?  And so I tried to take a little nap.  Yeah.  And these motherfuckers over here give me a hard time.  Right.  So what I got to do, I don't, it's not, I don't love them, but what I'm saying is that I want  to take my nap.  But you were napping for about two hours.  No.  Yeah, you were.  We watched you sleeping.  You are lying.  It was two hours.  It wasn't two hours.  You're not. 
[09:30:30]  You're lying.  It wasn't two hours.  I don't lie.  I napped for about half an hour.  It was two hours, Tippi Tom.  Well, Tippi Tom, he's unhappy.  And so what I'm saying is this, is that I'm going to bust somebody's nose.  All right.  Bust his nose.  That guy is the problem right there.  I'm trying to get another half hour in.  Yeah.  Can we get a song before you go back to sleep?  Can we get another song before you go back to sleep? 
[09:31:00]  A little lullaby, maybe.  Sing me a lullaby, please.  If I do one, I would.  Yes, you do.  Come on.  The one you always sing.  Which one?  You always sing your lullaby?  Yeah.  Sing the lullaby.  All right.  Radio's patient, right?  Yeah.  Right on.  All right.  Here we go.  Fairy tales can come true. 
[09:31:30]  They can happen to you.  Obviously.  If you're young at heart.  Now let me take a nap.  That's all you get.  That's all we get.  Hey, we want to hear about the drag queen from last night.  It's hard to define the matter.  It's hard to define the matter if you're young at heart.  But if you should survive.  To 102 or 3?  Something like that. 
[09:32:00]  Yeah.  If you are amongst the young at heart, give me the right answer to that.  All right.  Now, I can't do it like him.  All right.  Can we, um...  We want to know about the drag queen.  We want to know about the drag queen last night.  The drag queens?  All right.  Now, this drag queen...  You got a BJ from a drag queen, right?  I'm on 4th East Street, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  She come over to me, right?  Mm-hmm.  She says, hey, good looking. 
[09:32:30]  What's cooking?  What the fuck are you talking about?  My underwear.  She thought I was good looking.  Making stew.  And Timmy Thompson said, wait a second now.  I know you're good looking.  And I said, you're good looking too.  So what are we going to do about this?  He's going to use Jay Moore's line.  Yeah. 
[09:33:00]  So we got...  Did you pull your pants down?  So we got two good looking people together.  And drag queen.  Yeah.  Took pretty damn good stuff.  And so I got busy.  Where'd you go?  Behind the dumpster?  Well, we were going to do it behind the dumpster.  I didn't know.  You're a little more romantic than that.  Let's do it. 
[09:33:30]  Right on the sidewalk.  Man.  We're going to get busy.  So you pulled out your hog?  And we make money.  Sounds like George Carlin, doesn't he?  Damn fucking right.  Bullshit.  No behind the dumpster.  So what happened?  You pulled out your hog?  I'm not no cheap fuck.  I'm serious.  We are going to get busy.  Right there.  You motherfuckers.  And that's what happened was this. 
[09:34:00]  We did our thing.  And I ain't going to go into details.  You pulled out the old him squirt gun?  Can we see your stuff?  No.  Opie.  Don't even joke.  Don't give me time I'm on the radio now.  Can we see your stuff?  Shut up.  You guys shut up.  Yeah, let's see it.  I'm trying to explain myself.  After we got busy.  Yeah, yeah, busy. 
[09:34:30]  I gave her a buck.  You gave her a buck?  A buck.  All right.  Lots of money on me.  She want to get on a train.  But she need a buck fifty.  I said, all right.  I'll get you more fifty cents.  So where'd you get her fifty cents from?  So I bummed fifty cents from my buddy.  He gave me fifty cents. 
[09:35:00]  So I get her on the train.  And we done gone fucking over there.  And so make sure she go home.  She said, hey, Timmy time.  Why don't you come back to my house?  I said, yeah.  I'll meet you later on.  And these motherfuckers rubbed me up over here.  And so I'm all fucked up.  So I got her on the train.  I bumped fifty cents from my buddy. 
[09:35:30]  Give her my dollar.  And she's going to go uptown.  And that's what happened.  All right.  So buck how.  And with that, why don't you...  So he's got one clean spot on his body.  And all I got out of this whole fucking deal was a fucking blowjob.  All right.  And that was...  How about one more song and then you can go nap?  I can get the fuck out of here.  One more song and then you can go nap.  Yeah, think of a song.  And then we'll wake you up for the grand finale at the end of the show.  Yeah.  One more song.  Oh, Timmy Town, belt one out? 
[09:36:00]  Yeah, let's all belt one out.  Here we go.  I like the dance moves.  Let me snap this one out.  All right.  Everybody stand back.  All right, stand back.  Clear the field.  Some bums are going to do something.  What do you want to hear?  Is it rock and roll or something a little different?  I think we're enjoying the love songs or the nursery rhyme type things.  A little love song.  Something tender.  Something tender, sure.  A little tender?  Yeah.  I left my heart in San Francisco. 
[09:36:30]  Right next to the soap.  High on a hill, it calls to me.  Little cable cars.  Ah, fuck, I can't perform now.  No, you know I get no song.  Turn is really quinkly, doesn't he? 
[09:37:00]  Temperamental little fella.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Get from me.  He's like Sinatra.  All right, he's leaving.  He's leaving.  Please make him talk to other people in the office.  Please.  Please.  She's miserable out there.  All right, I'll sing a song in a little while.  All right, a little while he's going to sing it, taking a nap.  There he goes.  I'll kiss my ass.  Tippi Tom don't want to talk.  All right, Tippi Tom doesn't want to talk, Anthony.  Now give me a fucking horse.  Give me a what? 
[09:37:30]  Who am I talking to?  Fucking horse.  All right, look.  I'll tell you right now.  He's outside the studio.  Tippi Tom.  On mic, yes.  Don't feel good.  I got tummy upset.  And so what I'm saying is that.  If he blows a fart over, Johnny.  Is I love you and be well.  All right.  I will bust your ass if you give me a hard time.  But I love you.  Make him go to sleep.  The thing is, I love you. 
[09:38:00]  I love you too.  Go to sleep.  I need a nap, all right?  And I'll come back and visit, all right?  All right.  Take a nap.  Please.  Good night.  About five minutes.  And I'll come back.  All right.  We'll get Tippi Tom back in here in a little while.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Jersey.  Yes, Jerry.  Hi.  I'm imagining his hot, stinky, alcohol breath in my face.  And I'm gagging over here.  I know.  He just woke up.  He was sleeping.  And then his morning breath. 
[09:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  The videos will be up on opianthony.com.  And I smell a promo.  Tippi Tom sings.  He got sweepers.  The love ballads.  Tippi Tom sings the love ballads.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  I have a question for Master Paul.  What did you do to drop me?  He can't...  Outside the studio, no one can wake him up.  And you just dripped a little bit of water on his ear.  And he was up.  Yeah.  Water was nice and cold.  And it went down his ear and just woke him up. 
[09:39:00]  Just like that.  All the slapping and hitting him with the microphone did nothing but a drop of water in his ear.  One drop of water.  One drop of cold water right in his ear canal, right?  Exactly.  Oh.  It went down his eardrum.  That wakes you...  Yeah.  That'll wake you up.  All right.  I think my brother's on to something here.  He just handed me a note.  Have a homeless American Idol contest.  Ooh.  Imagine getting...  Is there any other guys out there that sing?  Tippi Tom that sings like...  Well, Ziggy used to, but Ziggy's dead.  Yeah, Ziggy.  Rock and roll Tommy.  Rock and roll Tommy.  It's not a bad idea. 
[09:39:30]  It's a great idea.  Ziggy's dead, baby.  Ziggy's dead.  We could give this to...  Keith, you want to run with this?  Ziggy.  It's a jab.  Keith could be the Simon Cow of this bit.  I think I could think of a couple other...  A couple more singing homeless that we can come up with?  Singing homeless?  Sure.  Oh, my God.  They're spraying them down right now.  Yeah, they are.  All right.  Why don't we step aside, take a break?  Awesome.  Is there anything you want to hear going into break?  This is a great smoothie.  I'll say it is.  It's banana.  It's orange.  You don't know what to make of it.  It's fantastic.  But it all falls under the subheading of yummy.  You guys want to hear anything going into break? 
[09:40:00]  No.  Nothing I could think of.  Nothing pops in your head?  Whatever you want, Ope.  Nothing aside from that foul stench is popping in my head.  Exactly.  It's just awful.  All right.  We'll just do this then.  I really do want to see his mule, though.  You're listening to Opie and Eddie's Best Bestest Ever.  So don't go anywhere, because there's more.

Another dead hooker in the office.  Well, what's it going to be?  Dump the body in the river or bury it in Jersey?  Let's bury this one.  Last one we dumped.  Surface Cousin.  Fine.  I'll get the shovels and the lime.  Let's use your car.  I just had mine washed.  You know, I'd love just one weekend that didn't involve getting rid of a corpse. 
[09:42:00]  Ron and Fez on XM 202.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  So, you were too lazy to catch the show today.  Or maybe you want to catch up on what happened last week on O&A.  Well, no sweat.

[09:42:30]  Jimmy, what's that website?  Audible.xmradio.com.  That's right.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Larry King.  Celine Dion.  Kayaks.  O&A's best bits.  Perfect.  You just reminded me of something.  We didn't play the audio of Celine Dion on Larry King.  No, we didn't.  This was priceless.  She was very upset.  Let's...  We all understand that it was a disaster down there.  Mm-hmm.  But how could you not laugh when Celine Dion just breaks into song on Larry King? 
[09:43:00]  Because that's going to help the victims.  That's what they need.  A song of Celine.  Ew, she sang.  Oh my God, this is really creepy.  Ew.  It's deeply disturbing.  Yeah.  I understand everyone.  Even we have been affected, and we're trying to do our part, but God damn, man.  Some of these people have got to relax.  Like Ben brought in the picture of Sean Penn walking around New Orleans with a shotgun.  A shotgun.  Here it is right here.  He's walking around with a shotgun, I guess, to protect himself as he goes on his rescue missions. 
[09:43:30]  I don't know.  There's a lot of stories about the shotgun.  Supposedly he found it laying around and picked it up.  Oh, please.  Others say that he brought it himself.  I was handing this to the police.  Right.  Shithead, you got caught.  It's okay for you to have a gun for protection, but nobody else, right?  Yeah.  His little scheme backfired.  You know, this guy brought his own photographer down there as he's rescuing people.  That's just no good. 
[09:44:00]  I thought he was an asshole for many years, but it turns out he really is kind of just  a weirdo.  Like, he's one of those real weird guys.  Be more like your brother.  He's fat and jolly and makes fun movies.  Looks like an alcoholic.  What a mess he is.  That's how I'm going to say that word from now on.  Alcoholic.  Alcoholic.  Maybe I'll get him on the show.  We have the same manager.  I'll talk to my manager.  Stop it.  See if I get him on the show.  And I have talked to Chris Penn in the past.  I've never met him. 
[09:44:30]  No, we did.  We did.  Many years ago.  No, in person, too.  Oh.  I got a picture with Chris Penn.  I want one.  I should bring in all my old celebrity photos.  They're kind of funny.  You should.  I'm up on the website there.  All right.  Here we go.  Celine Dion.  We got to play this a little bit here.  Celine.  A little bit.  Celine Dion and Larry King last week.  I have to say, Larry, that I'm as devastated as the rest of the world.  Devastated?  If I may, I was watching you behind.  There's a television right now.  I'm watching, and I'm especially waiting, like the rest of the world. 
[09:45:00]  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it.  Yeah, through your little pigeon neck.  She sounds like Christopher Walken.  Oh.  I can barely swallow it.  I can barely swallow it.  And she's in one of those ridiculous suites in Las Vegas.  From my huge 38-inch plasma television, I could not take the pain and anguish of those 
[09:45:30]  people as I look down on Las Vegas from my penthouse suite.  Why couldn't you swallow the coffee?  Was her husband using her mouth to practice rolling Dyson?  Well, we've heard he's got a problem.  What can I tell you?  We all have problems.  And I'm especially waiting, like the rest of the world.  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it.  I come here at Caesars Palace every night to perform.  Uh-oh.  I barely can sing.  Yeah, well.  But for respect, for the people who come, I am still singing. 
[09:46:00]  When I come home at night, my son is waiting for me.  I watch television.  Yes, we gave a million dollars.  But what we expect, what I want to look like the rest of the world.  I open the television.  There's people...  How do you open a television?  I open the television.  Opie, I don't think we should make fun of this.  She still sang while those people suffered. 
[09:46:30]  She's brave.  She is brave.  She's a brave girl.  We gave a million dollar.  I have a coffee.  We...  I don't know what plural is.  How about buying an S, you foreign whore?  Watch television?  Yes, we gave a million dollar.  But what we expect, what I want to look like the rest of the world.  I open the television.  See, it was a dollar, and she just wrote a million on it.  A million dollar? 
[09:47:00]  A million dollar.  And I open the television, and I see wires and tubes.  And I don't know what year it is, because there's never tubes in TVs anymore, you idiot.  I open television.  What?  But what we expect, what I want to look like the rest of the world.  Well, I open the television.  There's people still there, waiting to be rescued.  And for me, it's not acceptable.  I know there's reasons for it.  I'm sorry to say I'm being rude, but I don't want to hear those reasons. 
[09:47:30]  You know, some people...  They should fly her over, fly her over, like, the flooded areas.  Yeah.  In a helicopter and lower her down, and then she could sing the Titanic song.  Would that be great?  As they're hanging on to their roofs.  Hold on, Tyrone.  Tyrone, don't let go.  Don't ever let go, Tyrone.  If only there was room enough for you on that door, that your girlfriend is on right now.  It could be a huge cavernous door, and there still wouldn't be room. 
[09:48:00]  Have you seen the women down there?  Big fat asses.  You are a survivor.  Many people perished under the brown sewage of New Orleans.  Much like they did that fateful night in April of 19...  18?  12?  12?  14?  19, 12.  It was 12.  Shut up.  All right, sorry.  Much like they perished in the icy waters of the North Atlantic, on that fateful maiden voyage 
[09:48:30]  of the Titanic.  But some of them were survivors.  And Larry, I watch.  I watch, and personally, I don't care.  But I cry. 
[09:49:00]  I cry because my husband is 90 fucking years old.  I cry when I think he touched me when I was 14.  He forced me to marry him.  That is why I weep today.  You think I really care about the shwoogies, Larry?  How many bodies lie there beneath that mucky, brown, stinky mess? 
[09:49:30]  I say, pee you, Larry.  And some of them cling to their rooftops like many clung to life jackets and pieces of wood  on that fateful night on the Titanic.  And some of them are weak.  They are truly, truly, so Negroes.  They are so poor and so black. 
[09:50:00]  All right, back to the audio.  Jesus.  That was fantastic.  Oh, stop it.  Back to Celine.  More crying Celine.  And for me, it's not acceptable.  I know there's reasons for it.  I'm sorry to say I'm being rude, but I don't want to hear those reasons.  You know, some people are stealing and they're making a big deal out of it.  Oh, they're stealing 20 pair of jeans or they're stealing television sets. 
[09:50:30]  Who cares?  They're not going to go too far with it.  Maybe those people are so poor.  Some of the people who do that, they're so poor.  They've never touched anything in their lives.  Let them touch those things for once.  Invite them into your house.  Let them touch.  You also have never touched a seat at your show at Caesars, you fucking overpriced Canadian  hosebag.  But you never touched an orchestra seat there, did they?  Oh, my God.  Let them touch stuff.  Let them just touch it.  That's the biggest cock tease ever. 
[09:51:00]  Here, feel this plasma TV that you'll never have.  How racist she is.  Holy shit.  Just touch it.  Just touch it, because that'll make you feel better.  Unfortunately, they were touching guns at Walmart and touching the triggers.  Stop it.  I was inspired when they taught Coco to sign.  Oh, she did not say, let the people touch.  Just touch it.  Let just touch it.  Oh, my goodness. 
[09:51:30]  The people who do that, they're so poor.  They've never touched anything in their lives.  Let them touch those things for once.  The main thing right now, it's not the people who are stealing.  It's the people who are left there, and they're watching helicopters flying over their heads.  Helicopters.  And they're praying.  How come it's so easy to send planes in another country to kill everyone in a second to destroy lives?  We need to serve our country.  And for me to serve our country is to be there right now to rescue the rest of the people. 
[09:52:00]  We need the cash.  We need the blood.  We need the support.  Right now, we need the prayers.  Jesus, where's Larry through that hole?  Jesus, I was nodding off.  She has the foreign policy inside of a six-year-old.  Why do we send bombs to blow up their world and the universe?  In seconds.  In seconds.  Everything.  I can't get over the fact, let them touch things.  Just touch it.  Much like the poor passengers that were stuck in steerage on the Titanic, 
[09:52:30]  we should just pull gates shut and lock them to drown in their basements.  Look, Tyrone, you'll never have an iPod, but hey, feel free to touch it.  I want to touch it.  Right.  Oh, is that the best?  What a mess she is.  She continued on Larry King last week.  It is, you know, when I was hearing a couple of days ago that these things are not reachable,  it's too full of water. 
[09:53:00]  Maybe I'm too much like my, I'm not thinking with my head.  I'm talking with my heart.  Nobody can open any roofs.  The helicopter's flying in.  Take two people at a time.  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls.  Take a kayak?  A kayak.  Oh, she's an outdoorsy one.  Or take a limo like I do to go to my shows.  Why can't they take the flying Steve car and please pick up these people?  Take a kayak. 
[09:53:30]  Oh, it is so easy if Steve would just, there he is now, just fly by Steve.  Land and pick these people up in your flying hybrid car.  The helicopter's flying in.  Take two people at a time.  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls.  What?  There's kids being ready.  You can't take a kayak through walls.  Take a kayak through those walls? 
[09:54:00]  What does she say?  She watches Gilligan's Island too much.  You think that's how they get around?  A kayak.  Jesus, this isn't I Dream of Jeannie.  Is Jim leaving a permanent thing?  No.  Oh, stop it.  Stop it.  Still a big part of the show and he'll be coming back and forth and doing this and doing that.  Don't you worry.  There's kids being raped at night.  We hear gunshots.  Big guns.  What's that? 
[09:54:30]  Those people are playing.  They're walking.  They're like this.  Hello?  Do you see us?  We're still alive.  But we're dying.  She's terrible.  I do not want to talk to you about money.  What?  Holy crap.  Will you just shut up and sing your stupid song?  She lost her fucking mind and it's fantastic.  We can't see them at night because they're dark until they smile.  We see teeth.  We think they're floating dentures.  But there are people attached to those.  Oh, is she an ass?  Oh, I thought somebody dropped a big package of ping pong balls and I was looking. 
[09:55:00]  But it was humans looking up at me.  I thought it was ping pong balls and chiclets.  But it wasn't, Larry.  It was people.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Let's say hi to Carl in New Jersey.  Carl? 
[09:55:30]  Hey, she sounds like Mr. Wet.  Do you remember Mr. Wet?  Mr. Wet.  Yeah, there was two radio DJs.  They had a show back in the day.  I forget their names.  It was this fat guy.  You and Anthony referenced them all the time once in a while back in the day.  And she was like, Mr. Wet, I'm from the sewer.  I live under the ground.  I'm Mr. Wet.  Never, ever, ever.  This guy is amazing.  Man, I could have saved.  I'm sorry, Carl.  I really don't know what you're talking about.  All right, let's continue with.  Why are you taking the birthday cake out? 
[09:56:00]  Huh?  Oh, okay.  All right, more of Celine Dion.  Of course, please.  I want this burnt so I could listen to it on the way home.  Of course.  We're going to have Maury Povich in studio in a few minutes as well, so stay there.  Maury.  But first, Maury's going to have to wait a few minutes.  We've been doing the show now for two and a half hours.  We've been asking a lot of people how they can help, how you can help.  A lot of people all over the world want to help. 
[09:56:30]  You gave a million dollars.  You're going to help a lot of people live and survive.  You should take great pride in that.  One, that you've attained the ability to be able to do that, to be able to give a million dollars.  You should take pride in that.  I understand it's very important because eventually we will need that money.  But it's just very frustrating that Franco and Consciousness and me, oh, we have one million dollars.  This is one thing.  In three months, in six months, they will need that money.  Right now, they're praying for water. 
[09:57:00]  So we need to send them to water.  They don't care about my check.  No, they do.  It's just frustrating because on our part of the world, we're trying our death and we're expecting those people.  Oh, she don't shut up.  Your check will turn into something.  And I'm sending Welch's grape juice and garlic.  Doddering old buffoon.  Yeah, you know, I love Larry King's style where he pretty much doesn't do anything on his show and lets the people talk. 
[09:57:30]  But sometimes, as a host, you've got to jump in there a little bit.  My God, is she upset?  Shut up.  All right, here is the clip of clips.  I know you've got to go on soon, but we couldn't spend any time with you without asking you,  do you have any kind of thing you would like to sing that fits this moment?  She's got a song for everything.  Thanks, Larry.  She's got a song for everything.  Is there any song in your...  Even if you did a little of it. 
[09:58:00]  Well, I don't want to...  Well, the only song that comes to my mind right now  is definitely a prayer.  What's going on in Larry King's mind?  Do you think he knows she's just a lunatic at this point and is exploiting that?  Yeah.  Or is he dead serious about having Celine Dion sing a song for everybody?  I think he's just trying to get as much out of her as he can.  And at this point, having her do a song is the icing.  You think so? 
[09:58:30]  Is he being that calculating or is he just an out-of-touch ass?  That's what I'm wondering, you know.  Sing a song.  The Motley Crue.  Because she's not in the right frame of mind to actually sing a song.  Well, let's see how this plays out.  It's definitely a prayer.  I did sing that song a few years back with Andrea Bocelli.  Oh, yes.  And I cannot think about a song without a prayer.  I will do my very best and I'll do my best. 
[09:59:00]  Generals Cotter and our masses.  I pray you'll be all right.  And watch us where we go.  This just in.  Bruce Kelly's crying.  Help us to be wise in times when we don't know.  Let this be our prayer. 
[09:59:30]  When we lose our way, lead us to a place, guide us with your grace.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  You know it.  To the place where we'll be safe.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  I pray we'll find your life.  You can get a doggie style.  You can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices. 
[10:00:00]  This is my house and I get to sing.  When we hold pain on hearts.  When stars go out each night.  Minds of where you are.  Let this be our prayer.  Panty cough, panty cough, whore.  Let this be our days.  Help us find a place. 
[10:00:30]  Guide us with your grace.  Now choke yourself.  Give us faith so we'll be safe.  Well, no shit.  That's good.  Come on.  Okay, terrific.  And there you have it.  That's very dramatic.  Wow.  Celine Dion.  There it came last week.  Wow.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore. 
[10:01:00]  There you go.  Wow, she lost her mind.  That's fantastic.  Opie and Anthony's best.  Yes.  Most.  That's the sweeper.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Number three.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Or that stupid XM stinger they do.  What is it?  XM 202.  You know that awful, terrible, boring song, the Edmund Fitzgerald that seems to just go  on forever?  Yeah.  I'm so glad we're all here for this. 
[10:01:30]  Well, tell us more.  The guys go through it and play it, and they come up with some funny verses for that song.  Alternate lyrics?  Yes.  Wow.  Alternate lyrics.  And it went something like this.  I gotta tell you, though, one of the best reality shows on TV is that goddamn stupid crab  fishing show.  I don't know how I got caught up in that thing.  The hell is the crab fishing show?  The most dangerous catch on Discovery Channel.  Ever hear about this?  No.  They put cameras on a bunch of these ships that go out into the Bering Sea in Alaska. 
[10:02:00]  I thought they put cameras on toilet seats.  No.  No.  What are you talking about?  Crab fishing.  Crab fishing.  They put them on all these crabbing boats, and they go out into the Bering Sea.  They're by Alaska, and they go crabbing.  Now you'd think, okay, how is that a TV show?  Apparently this is like one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.  People die in all the time.  And it's a reality show, because they follow these people's lives and personalities and  their jobs. 
[10:02:30]  And what we've all wanted to see on reality shows, people are dropping dead.  Really?  People are dying.  They show the captain of some ship showing how to put on some emergency gear, and then  they're out on a boat, and one of the cameramen see the captain on the radio, and the ship  capsized, sunk.  The captain that was just doing the little thing on his gear, and six of his crewmen  are dead, and another guy falls overboard.  He's dead. 
[10:03:00]  People are getting injured all the time.  This is reality.  Why else would you watch a crab fishing show?  They ought to...  Ooh, I hope they bring up a bunch of crabs.  They ought to interview the crabs.  They have new deaths every week.  It's like a holocaust.  It's a crab holocaust.  Unbelievable.  But I got roped into watching this, and I'm watching it now all the time.  Most dangerous catch.  I never knew this show was on TV.  I sit there doing the Regan bit.  I'm watching fishing.  I'm not even fishing. 
[10:03:30]  I'm watching fishing.  But is the crab show, there's no...  It's just being filmed.  There's no phony reality angle, right?  It's just really being filmed.  No, it's just these guys, they're all a little kooky to be out there.  They work for...  It's only a few days, a couple of times a year that they do this.  And they could walk away with upwards of 10, 15 grand each for just a few days' work.  But it's just the worst job ever.  There's no immunity challenge?  No, no challenges.  Actually, they do have a Budweiser-sponsored crab count with which ship brings in the most pounds of crab. 
[10:04:00]  They should have, like, a body count because people are dropping dead.  There was one ship just keeled over.  And they found out that they had too many of these crab traps on it.  And it was top-heavy, overloaded.  The captain, yeah, screwed up and paid with his life.  Was that, like, by Lake Gichiguni?  It was, like, going from Cleveland into Canada somewhere? 
[10:04:30]  And there was a storm?  The Edmund Fitzgerald?  Well, our crab pots were full and we came into shore and...  I really like that song.  Jimmy was asking his questions.  That stupid Gordon Lightfoot.  This song goes on forever.  I love it, though.  And the water was at my ankles and this song goes on another hour.  Is that the song that makes you just get all tingly, Jimmy?  I just like it because I like the fact that he's doing a 40-minute ballad about...  The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[10:05:00]  I looked at the fuel gauge.  It was three-quarters full.  And we motored on toward our destination.  And then we bought a Rolls-Royce on eBay.  Maybe we could kill seven minutes like this play today.  Oh, my God.  And for my money back, he said,  Drop dead, you horse-toothed, too.  You're getting nothing back.  The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down.  And the big lake they call Kitchagumi.  Kitchagumi.  All right.  The lake it is said never gives up for a bit 
[10:05:30]  When the skies of November turn gloomy.  Gloomy.  Kitchagumi with gloomy.  With a load of iron ore, 26,000 tons more than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.  I spelt bad from fish and put on perfumey.  That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed when the gills of November came early.  They cast off yet?  We untied the bow line and untied the stern.  And I started the engine with a turn of the key. 
[10:06:00]  Jesus.  Every friggin' step of the way is the Edmund Fitzgerald.  We get it already.  We get it.  You're on a boat.  I took a compass heading of 135 and I turned the wheel.  All right.  And the purser got me my coffee.  I take it light and sweet, but he made it too dark.  And I sent them back to the galley.  All right.  What happened?  What happened next?  I went to sleep in my hand, sleep paralysis, and I woke up to the exorcist's face in my bed. 
[10:06:30]  Come on forever.  The wind in the wind made a tattle-tailed sun.  Watch it.  In the way it's worth the water reeling.  The song's only half over and I still see the dark.  I forgot my wallet in my car, so we turned the ship around and we docked again and I 
[10:07:00]  figured I'd stop for a beer.  Tune in and two hours later when the ship finally sinks.  Enough.  And then there's a throw in a musical interlude to make it longer.  Christ.  I put on my life vest and helped my crew put it on, too, and we stood there and, well, 
[10:07:30]  the water's now up to our knees.  See, look, there's...  All right, we'll just kind of...  It's still going.  We'll take a few phone calls and we'll go back to the song in a minute.  Scott in Arizona.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, how you guys doing this morning?  Pretty good.  What's up?  Pretty...  Ah, hey, I got...  Hey, don't get me wrong here.  You guys are great, man.  I mean, I love the shit out of you guys.  I got a little...  I got a little complaint about the crabbing thing.  I spent 15 years up in Alaska commercial fishing and then I just got in my big truck this 
[10:08:00]  morning and boom, first thing I turned you guys on this morning, you guys complaining  about the show.  What?  Yeah.  Who's complaining?  Oh, you said you didn't like it and then you're making fun of a bunch of...  I love the crab show.  That's what I was saying.  Were you listening or were you like me?  I'm not listening.  You better listen to the replay to hear what you meant.  Listen to the replay.  I love the crab show.  I said I can't stop watching it.  Oh, I apologize.  Did my brain fart.  My thing was I was saying that all crabbers are bums and incompetents. 
[10:08:30]  Anthony was disagreeing.  Well, I have to agree with you there.  All right.  Thank you.  We're going to move on.  Tad again from San Francisco.  I watched the History Channel show on the Edmund Fitzgerald.  It took three minutes for the boat to sink, so it takes longer for the song to play than  it took for the boat to actually sink.  Well, let's see where the song is.  All right.  Where are we?  He had water coming in, and the good ship and crew was in peril.  All right.  It's still starting to sink.  We'll go back to the song in a little while and see what happens. 
[10:09:00]  Let's take a couple of hours.  I said, hey, dude, what do you think about this?  He said, I don't know.  There might be a hole in the boat.  So we went down to the engine room, and yeah, there was a hole, and we sat and smoked a cigarette  or two, because it really wasn't that bad.  Let's say hi to Alex in Boston.  Alex?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got two points.  Jimmy, don't you play the most dangerous catch every night?  Not bad.  Not bad.  Jimmy tangling with some tainted vagina.  It's me on a boat with three Craigslist prostitutes. 
[10:09:30]  And crabs are involved also.  Very nice.  And Rick Ross buys a car like people buy drugs.  Give him the money first, wait, and I'll come back with a car.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  You should have started with that one.  Speaking of cars.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Jimmy.  All right.  Let's go back to the song and see where Gordon Lightfoot is at.  Uh-oh.  Check that sound.  Yeah. 
[10:10:00]  All right.  We'll check back.  He's still in that musical interlude there.  Who's that other ballad singer?  Oh, Steve Flamefoot.  He's like...  With the Captain Wyatt and the water coming in.  Oh, Steve Flamefoot.  Oh, 27,000 times more than the Edmund Fitzgerald.  He's separated the tea and the tea.  We have a little problem.  The striples, they won't take their clothes off. 
[10:10:30]  Striples?  The striples.  Yes.  They're kind of like an Australian children's naked singing group.  All right.  Before we go to break, let's see where Gordon Lightfoot is here.  All right.  He's still going.  Music.  Does anyone know where the love of God goes  When the waves turn the minutes to hours  Minutes to hours  The searchers all say they have made whitefish baits 
[10:11:00]  They put 15 more miles behind her  Huh?  They might have split up or they might have capsized  They may have drove deep and took water  And all that remains is the faces and the names  Of the wives and the sons and the daughters  All right.  We'll go back to Gordon Lightfoot after the break.  He's still singing along.  Now he's singing about the survivors and everything.  The wife remarried and had three kids 
[10:11:30]  And can't even remember his name.  Been 15 years and now I'm going to sing  About his children's experience in elementary school.  That's a bit of a long tune.  Oh, Christ.  I think we were making that point, Jimmy.  That's true.  I just jump in like, hey, guys, I have a thought.  That's a long song. 
[10:12:00]  Long song.  Gordon.  You come.  Gordon Lightfoot.  Heavy on the pen, though.  And my typewriter ran out of Vink.  Yeah.  He doesn't get to the end of it.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Let's go to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing, Chicken Lips?  That's very mean-spirited. 
[10:12:30]  What?  What?  What's painful?  What?  That fucking song.  That Gordon Lightfoot song.  You don't like that song?  No, dude.  It's fucking horrible.  It's not horrible.  Oh, it's terrible.  What do you prefer?  What kind of song do you prefer?  If I could just jump in and make a relative comparison?  Anything but that.  That's a little vague, sir.  I'll listen to Brother Joe's Journey covers.  You know.  All right.  I just don't do it.  This is all I had to say.  First of all, Loverboy did not do that fucking song with the Outfield, that I Want to Lose Your  Love Tonight.  Oh, yeah.  It was the Outfield. 
[10:13:00]  Very good.  And Night Ranger's other song was Don't Tell Me You Love Me.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, that was a huge hit.  Yeah, I remember that.  There you go.  Thank you, Chris.  Very informative.  You don't like Gordon Lightfoot, but you know Night Ranger and Loverboy songs from 1981.  Yeah, well, come on, dude.  1981, I was around then.  Like, I wasn't around in whatever the hell.  When did that song come out?  That Gordon Lightfoot.  I'm guessing in the mid-70s, probably after the actual accident.  All right.  Yeah, my parents were eating granola, and I wasn't born yet, so.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  All right, guys.  We've got to get back to Gordon Lightfoot.  Where is he at in this stupid song of his? 
[10:13:30]  Lake Huron, roll superior scenes in the rooms of her ice-water mansion.  Oh, Michigan steams like a young man's dreams.  The islands and bees are for sportsmen.  Then the sun's supernova, then the earth was burned to a crisp.  Then it's 50 billion years in the future.  It's in what Lake Huron can send her.  All right, we'll get back to Gordon Lightfoot. 
[10:14:00]  We're wear mylar suits, and we colonize Mars.  And Dan Lee finally got a sign on the TV show.  God, did I fuck that one up?  And Dan Lee finally got a sign on the TV show.  I wouldn't hurt you, Dan Lee.  I love every goddamn half a sign on your head.  Then when should we take Dan Lee to see a doctor?  As soon as possible.  I'm an elsehole. 
[10:14:30]  Dan Lee.  Oh, that's funny.  Devin from New Hampshire.  Andrea Yates played that song as she drowned her.  And the next one looked up and said, hey, what's going on here, Mom?  When the bubbles stop, four more to go.  And the workers all, oh, shit.  The searchers all say they'd have made 21 if this bitch had taken her medicine. 
[10:15:00]  Five little unopened boxes under the tree.  Well, speaking of Gordon Lightfoot, let's...  And two disappointed grandparents.  Let's see where Gordon is in the song.  Oh, hey.  Oh.  As I set off to sail from Modesto. 
[10:15:30]  A splash and a tear as my wife disappeared  Neat the blue briny waters of Modesto.  Are we finally at the end?  I don't know.  No.  Oh.  Is that it?  In a must-be old hall in Detroit, they prayed in the Marathon Sailor's Cathedral.  Oh, she's a dragon now. 
[10:16:00]  The church bell chimes if it rang 29 times.  Five times.  For each man on the edge, it's Gerald.  The legend lifts on from the Chippewa on down of the big lake they call...  Down to that ham, man.  All right.  We'll get back to Gordon Lightfoot.  I just want to hear the line where he says,  And a grandmother's wasted charm bracelet.  As Grandma sadly looks at the bottle of Johnson's Baby Shampoo. 
[10:16:30]  Unceremoniously dumps it in the toilet.  Because it's useless.  And the quack of a rubber ducky in the trash pile.  That is worse.  You are the worst.  You're the worst.  You're the worst.  You're the worst. 
[10:17:00]  Holy Jesus.  This is hysterically awful.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, my chest.  Let's see if we can get to the end of this.  Susan Smith sent the van down the boat ramp. 
[10:17:30]  Two little tykes in their car seat.  She said,  You little cock blockers, it's been nice to know you.  The big one said,  Mommy, why is we going backwards?  And she went on the news and pointed that Coco had taken her children. 
[10:18:00]  Speaking of the song, let's see if, uh, let's see what Gordon Lightfoot is.  Oh, there it is. 
[10:18:30]  It's fading out.  Wow.  Finally, we made it to the end.  Thank God.  I got tears coming down my cheeks.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony's Best Bits Ever.  You heard this much, but there's a lot more.  So maybe you're hungry and you want to have a sandwich.  That's all right.

[10:21:00]  Anthony.  And Norton, too.  Good times.  Great hits.  XM 202.  Suck my fucking cock.  The O.P. and Anthony Show has had a beef with the Tony Danza Show for quite some time.  And so we decided to mess with them a little bit by sending interns and employees out to the line waiting to get into the Tony Danza Show  and telling the eager fans that they're about to talk to Tony Danza  when really it was just Anthony doing his dead-on impression of Tony Danza. 
[10:21:30]  And things got a little crazy.  It's ONA's Best Bits.  Hello.  Hello.  Who's this?  Nathaniel.  Oh, what's up, buddy?  What do you got?  I got Debra in the Tony Danza line.  Oh, is she a big Tony Danza fan?  Huge fan.  All right.  Is she a fatty?  I'm sorry?  Is she a fatty?  Mmm, not really.  Okay.  All right.  We'll talk to her.  All right.  Here you go.  Hello?  Hello, Debra.  Hi. 
[10:22:00]  Hi, it's Tony Danza, Debra.  Hi, how are you, Tony?  Real good.  I hear you waiting to get in on my show.  I can't wait.  You can't wait, huh?  I hear you with my little friend Leslie, and it's her birthday today.  Leslie?  How old is she today?  Oh, I don't think she wants me to tell you that.  Oh, come on.  How old are you today, Leslie?  She said 39.  39.  You need to be the judge.  Hey, happy birthday, huh?  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Hey, my thoughts and prayers are with her on this fine birthday for her. 
[10:22:30]  Tony, you know who I thought you should have been for Halloween?  Who?  I thought you should have been Sammy Davis, because I watched the tape when you did the  tribute to Sammy Davis.  Remember you tap danced?  Oh, of course.  I love hoofing like Sammy.  I know, but I thought you should have been him for Halloween.  Well, actually, I went with the Spider-Man.  Did you see?  I didn't like that.  I didn't like it either.  I needed an apron to cover that up.  You know what I'm talking about, huh?  I know what you're talking about.  Hey, Tony Danza junk hanging out all over the place.  No, that was not for anybody to see. 
[10:23:00]  No, not for public consumption, huh?  No, I don't like those outfits.  I needed a dressing room just for my car.  I didn't hear you.  A bus just went by.  Yeah, the bus went by.  Good thing, huh?  Perfect timing.  Thank God.  So what do you like about my show?  I think you're very real.  I think you're very fresh.  I think you're just...  Wait till you see how fresh I can be.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I think you're just...  You're very wonderful.  You're gracious to your guests.  You're gracious to us that are watching you at home.  Hey, thank you so much. 
[10:23:30]  I want to tell you something, Debra.  We are going to...  Do you know where you're sitting for the audience?  No, I don't.  Well, we have VIP tickets.  I don't know what that means.  My husband's friend got them for us.  Well, let me tell you what that means.  You are going to be in the front row,  and I'm going to come over during the show and talk to you.  Okay.  You're going to be on television,  and I'm going to, you know, talk a little bit about the news,  maybe the election.  Who'd you vote for?  I didn't vote yet.  I'm voting after I leave you. 
[10:24:00]  And who are you going to vote for?  I'm not quite sure.  How about vote for Tony?  You know?  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Would I be able to get a picture with you?  Oh, absolutely.  Okay.  I actually want to pull my mule out,  put it on your shoulder,  and take a picture like that.  Pull your what out?  My mule.  A mule?  A mule.  You know how I ride up on different things every time?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to have a mule.  A big mule. 
[10:24:30]  You know what I would rather you do?  Right in your face.  My mule.  You know what I would rather you do when you open the show?  I'd rather you open it up with a song.  Oh, you like when I sing?  I do.  Yeah, I think you should do what you do best.  And what's that?  I have no clue.  I have.  When we were at Regis,  I bought my CV in,  and you said being I was the only person  that had your CV in the audience,  you came over and you signed it.  And I think that's how you should open the show,  rather than do the silly stuff.  Oh, you don't like the silly stuff? 
[10:25:00]  No, I like that you honored your father  when you came in on the garbage truck.  Hey, well, thoughts and prayers, you know?  Right, I like everything that's, like, sentimental and everything.  Yeah, sentimental, like my mule.  Like the stilts, you made me very nervous.  Oh, you didn't like the stilts?  It was kind of dangerous, wasn't it?  No, because...  Danger is my middle name.  Yeah, well, you have to be careful.  Hello?  Hey, I'm so happy that you're coming on the show.  I am, too.  Could you describe yourself 
[10:25:30]  so I know what you look like when I walk up to you?  Okay, I have blonde hair,  a brown eye.  Yeah.  I have on a...  Angela.  I have on, like, an argyle sweater,  black with different colors in it.  Yeah.  And I have my friend Leslie with me,  and she has short blonde hair.  How many...  Well, what do you look like as far as your body-wise,  so I can distinguish you from other blondes?  Oh, I'm pretty good.  Oh, you're hot, huh?  Yeah, I'm pretty good. 
[10:26:00]  Yeah?  Hey, you know...  I have to hang up.  How would you like to go out with me tonight?  I would love to.  You want to go out with Tony?  I would love to.  Tony and my mule.  Okay.  Yeah?  Hey, do you take it up the ass?  Goodbye.  Hey, Debra.  Debra.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Enjoy the show.  Hello?  What?  Nathaniel.  Yes, I am walking away fast. 
[10:26:30]  What happened?  What happened at the end there?  She goes...  She looked at me and goes,  he was nasty at the end.  She still thinks it was Tony?  I think so.  Oh, God.  That was awful.  Yeah.  How is she going to look at him now in that show?  All of a sudden, she just gets up and belts him in the face.  For no reason.  All right.  Great job, buddy.  Thanks.  Try to find one more person that wants to talk to Tony Danza, okay? 
[10:27:00]  They're going in right now.  Oh, really?  That might be it for today.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys did a great job out there.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Oh, yes.  You got it.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Take it off.  Poor woman.  Just crushed her image of the man she loves.  There you have it.  Opie and Anthony's best bits.  Best Ramone promo.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Ramone.  The sweeper has eight. 
[10:27:30]  Number two.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh.  It's in my shoes.  Ramone.  Clean this up.  All right.  Yeah, I'm here.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I have a lady right here.  Not only is she a huge Tony Danza fan, she was telling me that she used to be on The Family  Feud.  Back in when?  1993.  1993.  Did you score big?  We did top shows and we won over $18,000.  They won over $18,000 on The Family Feud. 
[10:28:00]  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Did you tell her that we were thinking about putting her on The Tony Danza Show today?  Yes, I did.  And they're all excited.  Her and her family is right here.  They're just waiting to speak to Tony.  All right.  And where is she from?  Where are you from?  We are from New Jersey.  Of course.  They're from Surgeonsville, New Jersey.  All right.  And what's her name?  Her name is Joan.  I'm going to give her the phone right now.  Just get Tony ready and he'll like to hear.  Tony character.  All right.  Let's get Joan on the phone here. 
[10:28:30]  Okay.  Here's Joan.  Yeah, he's right on the phone.  Hello, Tony.  Hey, Joan.  How you doing?  I'm doing fine.  We can't wait to come inside and see you in person.  Well, I can't wait to have you on the show.  Thank you.  I mean, we watch it every day.  We love it.  I especially like the food, particularly.  Oh, you like the cooking segments.  I do.  I like the food segments.  Well, you know, I love to cook.  Being Italian, you know, I cook a lot at home. 
[10:29:00]  Uh-huh.  And my kids, they get involved.  And I think it's something a lot of people like, you know?  Oh, you know what?  I have a great recipe for spaghetti and clams, the white sauce.  Spaghetti and clams.  That's my favorite.  Well, you know, I'll send you the recipe.  You got a fantastic recipe for that?  Yeah, I'll send it to you.  You know something?  Hey, one day, I would love to have you maybe come on the show as, you know, a listener cooking  segment or a viewer cooking segment. 
[10:29:30]  Oops.  Oh, I would love to.  I would love to.  And we could have you cook your special.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Actually, you know, if you ever come over to New Jersey, you can come out to Surgeonsville.  We live way out in the country.  And it's a beautiful area, close to the Delaware River.  Oh, you have a nice place out there?  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, we'll cook your spaghetti and clams first.  You might as well taste it before it's aired.  Yeah, I should taste it first. 
[10:30:00]  I like taking a little taste before I dip in, you know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, how long have you been a fan?  You remember me from taxi?  I'm sorry, Tandy.  I couldn't understand that.  Hey, you remember me from my old days in taxi?  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  We've been following your career.  You know, I know that you do shows in Atlantic City.  We're about two hours away from Atlantic City.  Oh, two hours.  So you go there a lot?  Say that again? 
[10:30:30]  So you go to Atlantic City a lot?  Oh, yes, yes.  Oh, I love going there.  The gambling, the wars, yeah.  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  You all get on the big loser bus and take that down there?  Yeah, yeah.  Fantastic.  It's great.  Are you going to be in Atlantic City soon?  Well, yeah.  You know, I got my album, so I like to sing.  And I go down there to Tropicana.  And I get up there and, you know, I whine and the rubes give me money. 
[10:31:00]  It's fantastic.  Oh, wonderful.  Wonderful.  Well, I have a cousin who happens to own a condo right on Boardwalk at the end of the  casinos, and it is just fabulous to go and visit him.  That sounds fantastic.  Yes.  You know something?  What?  You sound like a big Tony Danza fan.  I am the biggest Tony Danza fan.  So, I want to do something a little special for you.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Here it comes, kids. 
[10:31:30]  Hold on to your hats.  Okay.  I need a little relaxation before the show.  You know, it's a stressful situation being out there.  I'm kind of new to the talk show thing.  You understand?  Yes.  So, I'm thinking I could use a little company in the dressing room.  Oh, my goodness.  How would you like to come backstage and hang out with me while I get ready for the show?  I would love it.  I would love it to.  Do I bring my family? 
[10:32:00]  Me.  Excuse me?  Just me, or do I bring the three people I came with?  Well, who do you have with you?  My husband is here, and my two friends, Karen and Phyllis.  Your husband's there?  Yes.  Well, that's fantastic.  Yeah.  Can you see where this is going?  I can.  Now, I'd like you, you know something?  Bring the whole family with you.  Oh, Jamie.  Backstage to hang out with me before the show, because I need to relax a little bit. 
[10:32:30]  Okay.  Great.  That's great.  Well, you are just so special to say that.  Thank you so very much.  I love being special, and you know what relaxes me?  What's that?  I love to relax with you.  Strap in, kids.  You know what relaxes me backstage?  Excuse me?  You know what relaxes me backstage in my dressing room?  Sure.  A nice fucking blowjob.  Oh, my.  I'm sorry. 
[10:33:00]  I missed that on the phone.  No, you didn't.  Should I?  Tony likes having his hogs sucked before I gotta placate to the rubes out there?  I would never use a word like placate.  What am I, insane?  Before I entertain all the rubes out there in my audience, I like blowing a load on someone's face.  And you seem like that person.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Okay. 
[10:33:30]  Should I give this phone to Eric so he knows what's going on?  You better give it to him so he can run as fast as he can away from your husband when you tell him the news that you'll be backstage sucking Tony Danza's cock.  Okay.  Fantastic.  I heard what you said.  I'm going backstage, Eric.  Okay.  Okay, here.  I'm going to give you to Eric so you can tell him what's going on.  Fantastic.  Okay.  See you soon, Tony, and thank you so much.  You certainly will. 
[10:34:00]  All right, I will come back right out.  Hey, run, Eric, run.  All right, you got it?  Yeah, you can come home.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe, is she telling her husband right now?  That line, I'm sorry?  Is she telling her husband right now?  Oh, my God, they're jumping up and down.  I think she was so starstruck she had no clue what I was saying.  All right, ask her if she understands what's going on.  All right, hold on.  Let me move back. 
[10:34:30]  They're moving the line in.  Hold on.  Oh, jeez.  They're going to kill me.  Jump.  I just wanted to answer.  Do you guys understand what's going on and everything, right, about what he said?  About the backstage and all that?  Just be there.  Just be there?  Yes.  Yeah, she understands.  Does she?  Okay.  Does she understand what she has to do to Tony, though?  You understand what you have to do for Tony, right?  What?  She doesn't, she's not.  I was having trouble hearing you.  She was having trouble hearing.  She just said to tell her if, uh, to get what?  You want me to tell you?  Yes.  All right, what does Tony want her to do? 
[10:35:00]  I think that, uh, Tony should tell her.  Maybe Tony should tell her.  Yeah, Tony should tell her.  Tony wants to tell her?  Okay, hold on.  Yeah, Tony loves you.  You can't get enough of him.  Okay, I'm going to try to hear out here.  All right, Joan, you listening?  Yeah, I'm listening.  Look, I need you to come backstage before the show and give Tony Danza, myself, some oral  favors.  Some oral favors? 
[10:35:30]  Is that what you said?  What did you say?  You heard me right, honey.  Party favors?  No, not party favors.  I need oral treats before the show to get me loosened up, and I pick a broad online every  day.  Eric finds a broad that can give me oral favors.  I don't think when you blow it at me.  Eric is telling me I have to blow up those, uh, those party favor things.  No, he's saying a blow job. 
[10:36:00]  Yeah.  I know what you're saying.  I understand what you're saying.  Do you get it now?  I get it now.  Joan Jones, suck on my bone.  And you're not going to get this on television saying that?  No, no, no.  The Tony Danza on TV's got to be all nice.  The one backstage makes you choke.  She can't hear me right now?  She can't hear me right now?  Okay, I get it.  Get her to run up on stage during the show. 
[10:36:30]  All righty.  All right.  There's two Tony Danzas.  Also, I'm going to introduce you during the show.  Okay, that's good.  So, actually, I can't say your name.  That's all right.  But right after I say, Extravadanza, I want you to run up on stage and join me.  Oh, my goodness.  Absolutely.  I need a big hug from you.  Okay.  Right after I say, Extravadanza.  Yes.  In the audience, everyone yells it out for the big prize money. 
[10:37:00]  Yes.  And I'm going to present you with $10,000 for helping me out.  Oh, you're kidding.  So, all you've got to do right after, Extravadanza.  I run up just as though, I mean, no one introduces me, so I just look like I'm going to.  No, you're going to look like a crazed fan, but I'm going to put my arms around you.  I'm going to introduce you to the crowd.  Okay.  And, you know, it's for, you know, Disney, Visa, and Extravadanza.  Okay.  I can do that.  And don't, you know, you can tell your family and stuff, but we want to keep it secret from the audience. 
[10:37:30]  Okay.  Okay, that's it.  All right, Joan.  I will not be shy.  And I'll see you right after the show.  Okay.  Thank you, Tony.  Take care.  Thank you, Joan.  It's my pleasure.  No, my pleasure.  Okay, I'm going to give it to Eric.  Give the phone to Eric.  Okay.  All right, Eric, here's the deal.  You've got to, like, convince her.  So, tell her, you know what you have to do when Tony says Extravaganza. 
[10:38:00]  Extravadanza.  Sorry.  Extravadanza.  She has to run from the crowd and run on stage and hug Tony.  And if she does that, she gets $10,000, but she can't tell anyone it's happening.  She's got to wait five seconds for the graphics to show.  She's got to wait five seconds.  Well, no, by the time she gets up there.  Oh, they'll go right back to it.  Okay, okay.  Yeah.  All right?  Yeah, it'll be crazy.  Eric, try to sell that, all right?  And then get out of there.  All right.  Be as serious as possible.  And no one is supposed to know.  Tell her.  Okay.  That's a new bit.  Don't make it, like, too much of a secret where she's going to be on to it. 
[10:38:30]  Just reinforce what I said.  And Tony approved this, right?  Of course Tony did.  Yeah.  Of course.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  They're just reiterating to me, you know what to do during the extravadanza when the graphic  comes up.  Because he loves giving it out of the way other people's money.  You know that, right?  So when he does extravadanza, the graphics go up and she's up there doing the Plinko thing,  you know what to do, all right?  You go up there and give them...  And Tony's cool with it?  Uh-huh.  He's good.  And she's all excited.  All right.  Great.  Okay?  All right. 
[10:39:00]  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  You go inside.  You warm up.  And you have a good time at the show.  And we're going to get you backstage, all right?  Okay.  We're good.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  We'll see you in a little while.  Bye.  Holy ass.  Oh, if I'm watching that later and this broad does this, I'm going to crap myself.  That's just too easy.  I will crap myself.  They just are so thrilled to death that they are talking with Tony Danza that he could say  anything to these people.  Anything.  All right.  Oh, that was so funny.  Oh, please, God. 
[10:39:30]  Let that work.  Greg from Bloomfield.  Oh, man.  You jerk-offs are going to force me to watch that fucking Tony Danza show now.  Well, I hope it works.  It's an experiment.  We'll see.  It will eventually.  Eventually, it will work.  Absolutely.  If we have to send the intern out with a Tony Danza shirt, we have to have a Tony Danza  shirt made.  Who doesn't want one?  Well, you know, I'd like one, too.  One with him in a Spider-Man suit with that luscious hog.  That was fun.  All right.  Well. 
[10:40:00]  Wrapping.  That was great, dude.  Here it comes.  That was really good.  Another successful Tony Danza phone call.  Can't lose.  They love Tony.  Opie and Anthony's best bitch.  Most bestest sweeper.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Number two.  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock. 
[10:40:30]  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock.  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock.  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the centerpiece  of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo. 
[10:41:00]  All right.  A little surprise for everybody.  We haven't done this in a while.  Right?  No, we haven't.  And we can't tell you what it is because we want to get it done before anyone gets in  trouble, right?  We've done it in the past.  So let's go to Sex Bagel out on the streets of New York City.  Sex Bagel!  Hey, guys.  I'm out here in the cold, pouring rain with a bunch of Tony Danza fans here.  We have Tina from Philadelphia who is a massive Tony Danza fan.  And she would love nothing more to speak to Tony. 
[10:41:30]  Oh, that's wonderful.  All right.  I think Tony Danza is ready here.  Hello?  Hello?  I think we're ready for Tina.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  Okay.  Here you go.  Hello?  Tina.  Hi, Tony.  How are you?  Hey, how you doing, Tina?  Good.  We love you so much. 
[10:42:00]  There's eight of us.  You came all the way from Philadelphia to see you.  Philadelphia.  Hey.  See your grandmother, Kate.  Hey, you know, I'm doing very well in Philadelphia.  That's great.  The show, it taking off.  I am getting married.  I am so very excited.  I wanted to hear your CD.  I wanted to purchase one.  Oh, you like that?  Yes.  Yeah, well, I've loved singing for so many years.  And, you know, God bless.  I've been able to pursue that now and put out a CD.  Oh, that's great. 
[10:42:30]  I was a big fan of Who's the Boss?  Oh, Who's the Boss?  And, of course, that other show I was on.  But I still love you.  You're so haughty.  Oh, does that mean Tony might get lucky?  I'm happy to meet you.  Oh, you can't wait to come into the show.  Right.  And see.  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host?  Huh?  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host?  You're doing good.  You're doing great.  Oh, yeah?  I don't look like a complete buffoon up there. 
[10:43:00]  No, not at all.  Not at all.  You know, because I'm pretty stupid.  No, you're not.  But you're funny.  It's a great show.  Hey, you watch the reruns of Taxi?  Huh?  You watch the reruns of Taxi?  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  When I was a young guy, you know, my mule was all hard.  Definitely.  And that little guy was...  The little guy on Taxi. 
[10:43:30]  The little guy on Taxi.  The little guy on Taxi.  The little guy on Taxi, huh?  The little guy on Taxi, huh?  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Yeah.  Good friend of mine, Danny DeVito.  Oh.  Yeah, he used to make us laugh so much.  He'd come in, and after a night out banging whores, he'd go, smell my finger. 
[10:44:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, you know, a little too risque, I understand.  But, and then he, you know, the guy that would fix the cars?  Uh, uh, uh...  Aright, confianza.  Latka, you know, he would come in after banging brothers and say, smell my mule. 
[10:44:30]  You know, it's like Dr. Phil says.  You know, when you give something up, you've got to replace it with something else.  Right.  You know, you understand that, right?  Oh, I completely understand it.  Yeah, huh?  So how long before they let you in?  I don't know.  We're still waiting.  Hey, do you know who's on the show today?  No.  Uh-oh.  I was hoping you'd tell me, because they don't tell me until the last minute. 
[10:45:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we don't know who's on the show today.  Hey, how big of a Tony Danza fan are you?  I'm a big fan.  A big, big fan?  I'm a huge fan.  We're all huge fans.  We have eight people.  Yeah.  Um, that's not your CD.  Excuse me?  Could you give me a CD?  I will personally give you a CD after the show.  As a matter of fact, if you let my person on the scene there, Eric, know where you're sitting, 
[10:45:30]  how would you like to come backstage after the show and hang out with Tony?  I would love it.  I have eight people with me.  Can they come, too?  They could all come backstage.  That would be awesome.  But, you know, there's a little trade-off here.  Okay.  You know, a little trade-off.  I do for you.  You do for Tony Danza.  Okay.  All right? 
[10:46:00]  Do you understand?  I completely understand.  We love him.  Hello?  Here we go again.  Hello?  Do you know the kind of favor Tony needs?  You know, it's pretty, a lot of high pressure doing a show every day like this.  You understand?  I completely understand.  And I need to relax a little bit.  You know, I need to relax.  I used to have to relax on a set of taxi and who's the boss.  And there were people that would help me relax. 
[10:46:30]  Maybe you could help me relax a little bit is what I'm saying.  I'll help you relax.  You know, maybe a little back rub.  Definitely.  Would you like to give me a back rub?  I sure will.  Hey, maybe a little front rub.  Oh, my God.  Are you married?  Yeah, I'm getting married in March.  Yeah, well, I'll try to put a stop to that, huh?  Hey, you keep your husband happy, huh?  Yes.  Definitely. 
[10:47:00]  Hey, you want to do me a favor?  Sure.  When I'm doing my monologue at the beginning of the show,  would you come up on stage and give me a kiss?  Oh, I sure will.  I would love it.  You know, I'm starting a new segment on the program,  and I like having a lovely young lady come out on stage  and give me a little peck on the cheek.  I would be honored to.  I would definitely be honored to. 
[10:47:30]  Now, we need a good time for you to come out.  Okay.  And give me that little kiss on the cheek.  Okay, definitely.  Now, as soon as I walk out.  Okay.  I'll walk out on the stage.  Okay.  And I want you to, you know, the audience is applauding  because I'm Tony Danza.  Uh-huh.  And you come out.  Really?  And I'll be like, oh, here's someone from the crowd. 
[10:48:00]  And just say, I love you, Tony, and give me a kiss on the cheek.  Oh, that would be awesome.  And then you go back to your seat, and I'll give you a CD,  and you come back and give me a massage.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  I'm so excited.  And so am I.  Thank you.  I won't ruin it by saying anything else.  All right.  I look forward to seeing you on stage at the beginning of the show.  I sure will.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you very much.  God bless.  Thank you very much.  God bless you, too.  Bye-bye.  Hey, guys. 
[10:48:30]  Eric.  Hey, we have the head of security here.  He's right next to me.  He wants to confirm that this isn't the Opie and Anthony show,  that it's really Z100.  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  All right.  We have somebody from the company who wants to,  if you want to confirm it.  Oh, it didn't happen there.  Uh-oh.  Well, it sounds like somebody's on to this. 
[10:49:00]  Oop, shenanigans.  I knew it.  I knew it was too good to be true.  Someone from the show knows the deal now.  That stinks.  Oh.  Well, I'm still going to have to watch today,  and hopefully they won't talk to that woman.  Yeah, they'll talk right to her.  Do you think?  Yeah.  We'll get it done.  I don't know.  Maybe Eric kept her away from the girl I was talking to.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Boy, they always think it's Tony.  They're so happy to talk to that.  Your impression is phenomenal, though.  I think it's Tony, and I'm looking at you.  Big dumbass. 
[10:49:30]  Eric's all nervous.  He's down there in his fake Tony Danza t-shirt.  Is he wearing a fake Tony Danza t-shirt?  Yeah, he went down there with it.  We actually had t-shirts made up.  Let's say Tony Danza show staff.  We got a Tony Danza staff t-shirt, a jacket, a hat.  Oh, yeah.  We go all out for our bits.  We do it enough.  One of these days, it's going to happen.  They probably make an announcement before the show. 
[10:50:00]  We don't know.  If Tony spoke with you.  Look, if Tony Danza spoke with you on the phone,  don't come running out on the stage, okay?  You fucking ronks.  Come out and give me a kiss on my cock.  Duh.  Oh, wow.  She was very happy to talk with Tony.  You may have to just be vicious from now on then.  If it's never going to get on stage,  you may just have to keep smashing them with filth. 
[10:50:30]  I know.  You know what's really funny?  She doesn't...  I'm talking to her,  and I bring up that Dr. Phil said,  you know,  if you give something up,  you've got to replace it with something.  You understand?  And she's like,  oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, she's just so thrilled to talk with this idiot  that she doesn't care what he's saying.  She's just agreeing with it.  She's agreeing with anything.  We're trying to get Eric back on the line, but...  Hey, where'd he go?  Ben's laughing.  Ben, you can come back in.  The boss thing's over.  Jesus.  I don't know, but he's got something to say. 
[10:51:00]  He's in an outbreak suit, Ben.  He's just afraid.  He's being...  They're threatening to arrest him.  What?  Disorderly conduct.  How is that disorderly conduct?  He's the most orderly guy ever.  Then they grabbed his phone or something.  They grabbed his phone.  Grabbed his phone.  Is this going to be the first person arrested  on the new Opie and Anthony show?  Eric.  Why can't I fucking do it?  Hello?  Hey, what's up, Eric?  Yeah, they're not letting me leave. 
[10:51:30]  They're threatening to arrest me here  for disordinary contact and ruining their show.  Eric, run away.  They're not cops.  Leave right now.  Run.  Are you serious?  Hello?  Oh, they got him again.  Just run away.  He's got to just run.  They don't understand.  People don't understand.  If they're not cops, you can flee.  Run away.  Oh, Eric's going to get arrested now.  Eric's going to get arrested  because he's not running away.  Like stupid Mercurio.  Run away.  Run.  Run.  They're not cops.  You can run from Danza security. 
[10:52:00]  They're not going to put an APB.  Hey, call in all cars.  Call in all cars.  Look for a cute little chubby boy  with frosted hair.  Car 54, where are you?  Oh, it's the Danza police.  The Danza police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Are you kidding me?  I thought we were pretty sneaky today.  They've been just waiting for us, huh?  Pull over.  Who's the boss?  I'm the boss.  Don't make a move. 
[10:52:30]  Drop the cell phone.  Well, someone has to get down there.  Oh, he's got to run.  I'll give Ben all the numbers for the record label guy.  So I'll go down there.  Well, uh...  Disturb?  What is it?  Disorderly conduct?  That was the most orderly call ever.  Danny's good.  Danny, go run down there with a cell phone.  Don't get caught and tell us what the hell's going on.  Because they took us...  Oh, wait.  Is he back?  Who's this?  Hey, it's Eric.  All right, what's going on?  The guy keeps taking the fuck...  Smacking the phone out of my hand and closing it. 
[10:53:00]  He's like, I don't give a fuck who you're talking to.  He's like, if you...  And he's sitting here trying to take my picture and everything.  Just walk away, stupid.  I'm not...  I've been trying to, but the guy won't let me fucking keep you getting me, girl.  What, is he holding on to you?  Yeah.  He's not allowed to hold you.  That's assault.  Punch him in the face.  Punch him in the...  Friggin' nuts.  I have an idea.  I said, no, I just took a cab here.  And he said, well, how would you want to benefit?  I go through you.  You got a lot.  I said, you can't go through me.  I don't know who the fuck you are.  You're not a cop.  He's not a cop?  Run.  Run away. 
[10:53:30]  I'm trying to.  Break loose and run.  Break loose.  Break loose.  Use one of those...  Unbelievable.  Use a master pose.  Data security can't tell him not to be on the phone.  You can talk to anybody on line.  Is our guy going to get arrested with a fake Tony Dantz?  You can talk to anybody on line with a phone.  You don't want to be at the tombs with a Tony Dantz show t-shirt on.  All right.  Well, uh...  Hey, my thoughts and prayers are with Eric. 
[10:54:00]  You know, Danny can handle this, because we need you for the next segment.  Can Danny handle this, though, or should Steve go?  No, Danny can handle this.  He's good.  Just tell Danny to run there with the phone.  All right.  All right?  I got Steve's strategy.  Steve will go there.  They'll be upset.  Pull the fire alarms, because they'll see a blade.  And he'll be able to make good his escape.  Yeah, you weren't in Chicago overnight, were you?  No.  No, sorry.  I saw some of your clothes flying out a window.  Doing a little office work at night, were you?  How can this head of security smack his phone?  Who the fuck is this guy?  He's a Tony Danza security. 
[10:54:30]  He's a bully.  That's all he is.  He's intimidating him.  He's probably...  He's huge...  I bet you he's a huge black guy that just thinks he can intimidate the shit out of Eric,  and Eric's scared.  Wow.  Send Master Poe.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  We really should.  We should send Poe down there.  Send Poe down there.  Oh.  Spin kick the son of the...  Go in and just kick ass on the Danza set.  No, but you know what?  If Eric is going to be hassled physically, you can't have that.  It can't happen to him.  No.  The guy could be arrested for assault right there, just holding him.  Just grabbing him.  Just grabbing him.  He could be knocking the cell phone out of his...  Absolutely not.  You're allowed to go online and interview or talk to anybody you want. 
[10:55:00]  There's no security guy on a sidewalk.  Well, can better somebody have Billy Mac or one of those guys on the phone?  Billy Mac.  Billy Mac.  Master Poe.  What's wrong?  Eric's in trouble?  Yeah, one of our guys is in trouble.  Yeah.  No bullshit.  He's online with Tony Gamba thing.  He's getting arrested.  The head of security won't...  He's just on the phone.  He wasn't doing anything.  And the head of security is like...  Like every time he tries to call the show, the head of security won't let him go.  And he keeps like smacking his phone.  And he's like...  What exactly did he do? 
[10:55:30]  On the phone.  Just with the phone.  Like interviewing somebody on the line.  Okay.  This just in.  He got away?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, good.  Of course.  Is he running?  Yeah, he's running.  I just told him I'm running in the middle of traffic.  You can lose him.  What did they do to him?  Oh, I don't know.  Nothing now.  They knocked the cell phone out of his hand.  Right?  We'll get the phone.  Okay.  Or when Eric gets back here.  We're getting in contact with Keith.  You can't do that.  Bodily holding him.  No, you can't do that.  That's against the law.  You can't smack anything out of anyone.  When Sex Bagel gets back, we'll find out exactly what happened.  Dude, I really think that if he smacked the phone out of his hand, Eric should file a report. 
[10:56:00]  Exactly.  There's nothing illegal about interviewing somebody on a line.  Of course not.  How do we have to deal with cops again?  Twice already?  It's not against the law.  No.  Eric's not a disorderly guy.  It's not against the law.  Maybe he can get free tickets for Tony.  And he's a nice guy.  He did nothing.  Oh, my God.  Master Poe's trying to lose his mind.  Look at him.  Breathe.  He's taking the legal road.  Breathe.  Thoughts and prayers, Poe.  Breathe.  We got to get some boards in here that you can break when you just get pissed off.  We should contact Keith because, honestly... 
[10:56:30]  Well, we'll find out as soon as Eric gets here.  That's wrong.  Yeah, it's wrong.  I hope he's ditching the Tony Danza t-shirt where Master Poe ditched the bloody gee.  The bloody gee in a dumpster.  That'd work.  Ditch the evidence.  Eric, if you're listening to us, ditch the evidence.  How is he listening to you?  He doesn't have...  Maybe he has a Wi-Fi.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, we'll find out what happens when he gets here, okay?  Okay.  All right, Poe.  Breathe.  Breathe for us, okay?  Poe's very pissed off.  Eric running down the street.  Cure bombs, Bob! 
[10:57:00]  All right.  He got the word in.  Great.  Man, they've been waiting for us.  We've been wondering.  We were being set up.  We were being lulled into a false sense of security.  You heard how sneaky we were.  We didn't tell anyone.  We just went to it real fast.  He's there with the dopey shirt on.  You know that pissed them off.  Too bad.  It's not illegal.  You can wear whatever the hell you want.  It says the Tony Danza show.  But why they ask if you were the other radio station.  I guess it's okay if Z100 does it, but not us.  Because Z100 isn't going to say things like Tony needs his cock sucked on.  I think it might have been, from what I was gathering there, they think Eric was saying he was with the Opie and Anthony show, but he was really with Z100, so they wanted to know who was really at the bottom of this so they could get them in trouble. 
[10:57:30]  So they were trying to get Z100 in trouble, thinking it was Z100.  That's what I think.  There you go.  I don't think they have a relationship with Z100.  I think they thought Eric was lying and saying it was Opie and Anthony.  I think Eric panicked and said, I'm with Z100.  Oh, you think Eric did that? 
[10:58:00]  Of course he did.  Or a misrepresentation of himself.  Would you say you were with Opie and Anthony on the line?  He's probably just wondering, who are you here with?  You know, some douchebag security guy.  Yeah, he does do that to get out of trouble.  Oh, yeah, and he figures out what's the faggiest radio station, so maybe they'll have, you know, some sympathy for me.  It's Opie and Anthony's best sandwiches.  I mean, bits.  Best bits ever.  It's Opie and Anthony's best bits ever.  There's more of it, so don't go and play any games. 
[10:58:30]  I'm not allowed to be alone.  You know how it is.  You're at home, nothing in the fridge, but some old mustard, six-day-old Chinese,  and a couple of beers.  So what are you going to do?

[11:00:00]  Next time, on a very special Ron and Fez.  Ron makes a tough decision.  Great, Ron.  Another dead hooker in the office.  Well, what's it gonna be?  Dump the body in the river or bury it in Jersey?  Let's bury this one.  Last one we dumped.  Surface too soon.  Fine.  I'll get the shovels and the lime.  Uh, let's use your car.  I just had mine washed.  You know, I'd love just one weekend that didn't involve getting rid of a corpse.  Ron and Fez.  On XM202. 
[11:00:30]  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony's best bits.  Best in-studio guests.  It's a freak show.  It's a freak show.  Number one.  This is when Bob Saget came in, and it was really funny.  That's why we consider it one of ONA's best bits.  I like it.  Probably one of the best bits.  That's good.  I like you guys, and I like what Satellite Radio is doing a lot.  Yeah.  I like what you guys are doing.  It's a lot of fun, being able to do whatever the hell you want. 
[11:01:00]  You could say Schmegma, and then...  Oh, that's the one thing you can't say.  Oh, no.  So we had to dump out of that.  How about Taint?  You could talk about Taint?  Taint.  That's the only thing you can say.  See, the feedback is going crazy on the phones.  Everyone is amazed that you're so dirty, Bob.  Well, they can go fuck themselves.  I've always been like this.  30 years of it.  I've always not been quite this dirty.  Well, now you got the gig on the show, on Full House.  I had to get a job.  I had a new kid, and then my ex-wife almost died while I was fucking her.  No, when she gave birth.  When she gave birth.  We've had a lot of death and stuff. 
[11:01:30]  I have two dead sisters and shit.  Jesus.  Two dead sisters.  Well, Jesus died, too, and I'm not responsible for murder.  I didn't...  On the cross, was that?  Well, he's dead, but then didn't stay dead.  That's the beauty.  That's what I hear.  Yeah.  It's not on the Thomas Guide, exactly.  He's a zombie.  But you must not have known.  They're all in Aruba.  They never found a body.  No.  Well...  She's hot, by the way.  Yes.  What's up, Will?  Well, she was hot.  Yeah.  She might be.  You never know where it is.  We've made...  Let me tell you where the line isn't on this show.  Okay. 
[11:02:00]  We've made light of Adam Walsh's head.  Ah.  So, I really don't...  Even Bob Saget is shit.  Well, I'm just trying to give you a ballpark here.  It's...  I was on...  Wide open.  I was on CNN yesterday.  Yeah.  Penn Jillette was being the director and Penn Jillette of the Aristocrats.  And I was...  They were putting us on showbiz tonight.  And they had 45 minutes of Peter Jennings is dead.  We love Peter Jennings.  What a great man.  What a great man.  And now, Bob Saget from the Aristocrats.  Oh, hey.  Be funny.  And I'm like, this is a movie about incest and shitting and pissing on each other. 
[11:02:30]  Yeah.  Where does that fall into the tribute?  And so Penn Jillette's on in Vegas.  And he's all happy because he's just, like, cursing through the IFB before we go on.  You're sitting there with an asshole, Bob?  And I'm like, Peter Jennings is dead, dude.  It's a good story.  I'm very relieved to be here where I could talk about this.  Yes.  What is that sound?  I'm hearing something that sounds like a record.  He gave me fucking Engelbert Humperdinck's mic.  It's a wireless mic, and we didn't have batteries for it. 
[11:03:00]  They had to charge him really fast.  It sounded like...  So his wireless mic's going to crap out within 10 minutes.  Oh, that's wonderful.  I don't care.  I'll share it with Jim Norton.  I know where his mouth has been.  Oh, my God.  Sorry if it smells like bleach.  Your mic smells like my cock.  You want to take a call?  I'll talk to somebody.  I've got to say, too, the first time I realized that Bob was really dirty was it had half-baked.  Everybody was shocked.  I think the line was something about sucking cocks for coke.  Yeah, I sucked dick for coke.  Yeah.  And the fucking place went crazy. 
[11:03:30]  It was the biggest laugh in the film, because nobody expected that to come out of your mouth.  I got honored at Harvard on the basis of that.  Really?  At the Harvard Lampoon and Sanders Theater and 1,200 people.  And they lower a screen, 35-millimeter projection, and run the clip.  And then I did stand-up for like 30 minutes, and they went nuts.  Then I went, oh, these are my people.  So then I started doing stand-up a lot more for theaters.  People don't understand.  It's a fucking part you played.  And when that cheesy music starts up, and you're giving your little lesson to one of the daughters or something.  But you know what, Michelle, it's really not good to jack off a horse. 
[11:04:00]  But he's in the living room, Dad.  Ah, you got a point.  I've been blowing the dog.  You know what it is, though?  And I don't blame people.  It was a good show for what it is.  The show's made for 12-year-old girls.  It's a family little show.  There's nothing fucking wrong with that.  You got a 12-year-old at home, you don't want them listening to shit like this and talking about fucking dogs and shit.  Had a little Uncle Jesse on there.  He had a little mullet.  He had his mullet.  A little mullet head.  Dave Coulier shaved his balls, which he did. 
[11:04:30]  He had the sting haircut, the reverse sting Phil Collins, whatever, the emperor's ball haircut.  All right.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Yeah, no worries.  Let's go to the phones.  John, what's up?  Hey, Bob, I've got a question, man.  I saw Dave Coulier perform in my school, and he is a complete hack.  Oh, don't say that about him.  He shaves his balls.  Yeah, but I mean, I don't know.  It was just, he's doing Rocky and Bullwinkle impressions on stage, and I hear you in, like, these movies, and I don't know, man.  Well, I'm not doing that.  I'll do it if I'm fucking Rocky. 
[11:05:00]  Here's something you're really like.  Oh, my God.  Bullwinkle, let go of my nuts.  You know, I just, he's a funny, funny guy.  Sometimes I think maybe he chose the wrong material for a college audience.  Maybe, is that what it is?  That's a good one.  Boy, that's diplomatic of you.  Dave's one of my dear friends.  Yeah, of course.  It's hard, you know.  Yeah, no, no.  And the thing is, too, you just laugh about your bank accounts from that show.  Faulty is.  Just look and show each other, like me, and over here.  Did you guys do that?  Oh, why'd you tell those jokes? 
[11:05:30]  Look at this, fucker.  Enjoy your pickup.  Look at this.  It's huge.  No, but I hear you.  But was he funny at all for you?  We got rid of him there.  Oh, God.  Sorry about that.  I'm sorry.  Too late.  Steve in New Mexico.  Yeah, nice.  Steve.  Hey, what's up, guys?  He throws your buddy under a bus and then leaves.  Steve.  Steve, go.  Hey, Bob, listening to you is like fucking listening to South Park the first time I watched the movie,  and they come out of that theater and just start cussing up at the start. 
[11:06:00]  It's the funniest shit I ever heard, man.  Oh, that's a big compliment.  Thank you, man.  My stand-up's kind of like that.  The aristocrat's too dirty.  The aristocrat's like X-rated or NC-70.  My stand-up, I just say fuck a bunch and talk about fucking people's daughters.  Nothing too dirty.  When you did Entourage a couple weeks ago, playing yourself.  Smoking a bong and banging hookers.  That's life.  I had to show that to my real children just so they'd know because that's real popular.  Their friends all watch that shit.  I love Entourage.  So I have an 18, 15, and a 12-year-old daughter, and I'm fucking all their friends, and that's  not true.  Oh, my God. 
[11:06:30]  And that's not true.  Just a couple of them.  I'm not fucking their friends.  My 12-year-old, come on.  They haven't even reached their chair yet.  Let's go to Larry in New Jersey.  Larry.  We're going to hell.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Rana Fenn.  Glad to have you back.  Cool.  Bob, I have the opposite thing where it's like everyone's like, oh, my God, you have Danny  Tanner from Full House, and now he's talking about sucking horse cops.  But the other way around, you're on the Young Comedian special.  Yeah, it was Rodney.  And you're talking about a seven-year-old giving you a blowjob.  Next thing I see you on Full House, I'm like, whoa. 
[11:07:00]  Right.  Why did he do that?  Yeah, what was with his...  Well, here's the deal.  I had a job in New York.  First thing I did was a Richard Pryor movie called Critical Condition.  It's the first job I got after nine years.  I was trying to get a job.  And then I got to say, fuck in that.  It was an R-rated movie.  And I got to work with Richard Pryor for a month.  So that's like the shit.  And then before that, Rodney Dangerfield mentored me and put me on his Young Comedian show  with Sam Kennison and Louie Anderson and Rita Rudner and all that, those people.  And then I got a job in the CBS Morning program here in New York and I got fired after five 
[11:07:30]  months.  And you know what it's like.  It's...  I got fired, fired.  I got...  I had a hosting chair on CBS on the...  You know, against Today Show.  And I got there one morning and the chair was gone.  Oh, wow.  And they went, and they went, we'll try to get your chair back.  Oh.  And so I got a phone call that they wanted to recast the guy in Full House.  And I said, yeah.  I mean, I would have fucking signed...  I'd have been eating horse shit out of a guy in the park, you know, out of a man's ass  with horse shit coming out of it. 
[11:08:00]  And so I went...  I just had a baby here at Lenox Hill.  I went to L.A.  Did Full House.  It was, I don't know, I said, Felix Unger, I'll hug, you know, I'll be clean, I'll be a  neat freak.  I love how he's got to explain the fact that he's on a huge hit show making massive amounts  of successful stuff.  Yeah, but I had a bouffant hairdo and I was like the gayest guy that ever lived.  And then I did a video show with those jokes from my grandmother's ass.  Right, yeah.  That's right.  You're on two huge shows.  That's a giant hit.  And the jokes traveled around the world, but they wouldn't have if I talked like my stand-up  because here's a guy getting hit in a dick, enjoy your meal, you know. 
[11:08:30]  Here's an old man getting killed by shrapnel, fuck you.  You can't do that.  So the answer is, you're right.  Watch his cunt get petrified as this man jumps out of a cake.  And the winner is big fat cunt.  But who will it be?  But that was Ernie Anderson.  He died of cancer.  He was P.T. Anderson's dad.  Really?  True thing.  What a happy story.  Lovely.  Enjoy it.  Bring it up.  Have your cereal.  That's good.  You still got on a plane with him.  Yeah.  No, really.  That was a guy who just asked a question or made a comment, and I talked for seven minutes.  That's fine. 
[11:09:00]  How many years was Paul House on?  Eight.  Jesus.  Let's go to Tennessee.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to ask Bob Saget.  When you hosted that show, America's Funniest Home Video, was that your material or was that  written?  Because I'm telling you, I thought you were garbage.  But now sitting here listening to you speak, I think you're pretty cool, man.  Well, thank you.  Was that your material or what?  It was, this is the truth.  I'll just say the truth.  It was written by two skinheads.  No, it was written by two friends of mine that are Canadian.  That's why.  There was like an 18% exchange rate on the joke. 
[11:09:30]  But it was, and myself.  I did, I did had, we wrote 55 pages a week.  What I thought I did okay on there was writing the voiceovers to the animals.  And I did those voices, the real shitty ones, like, oh, look out, my balls.  Oh, I remember that.  That was a cat.  Yes, sir.  I accept, except, that was a cat and a squirrel and a goose.  Here I am, chasing my tail, chasing my tail.  Pooch and a rock, pooch and a rock, pooch and a rock.  But, sir, Pooch and a rock is famous.  But, sir, I feel your pain because I felt it much more. 
[11:10:00]  But there's no, I was doing network TV, and it was either quit the show, which is my option,  or try to somehow feed the box, which is the lowest common denominator,  and the show traveled to, like, Spain.  It was like third world.  And it went to people that don't even have lives.  And in Lebanon, they told me they stopped the war to watch this show.  That's a fucking dumb war if you're going to fight a war and stop it for America's funny.  So I agree, sir.  I felt the same way about myself.  Pushing a rock, pushing a rock. 
[11:10:30]  Blowing it off, blowing it off.  Putting it back.  But, sorry, sorry, man.  I don't know what to do.  Pushing a Jew.  Blowing up a Jew.  Eating some flan.  What the fuck's he got flan for?  But I...  The show's still around.  What?  Why aren't you with the show anymore?  Oh, it's ten years.  No, they offered me to stay if I would take, like, a third pay cut.  Wow.  And I said, that is an attractive offer.  You really pull that over.  And we don't want you to write it.  Oh, that's... 
[11:11:00]  Well, I don't blame you on that, but still.  Great.  So it was...  I wanted to do acting and directing, and I directed some stuff for a few years that didn't become  a hit, like Dirty Work, which is kind of a cult movie.  It's Norm MacDonald's, Chris Farley's last movie.  Would have put Jim in it.  No.  Would have put Jim in it.  You got fucked.  Thank you.  Wait, what happened?  You were supposed to be in that movie?  No.  We talked about you, though.  Did you?  Yeah, we did.  Swear to God.  Oh, wow.  See that?  You didn't even know.  Oh.  But, uh...  Oh, that's gonna...  That's gonna kill him today. 
[11:11:30]  Well, I was going...  When I saw Bob at Caroline's, the first time I met him, like, a week ago after the Aristocrats  party, I'm like, I'm gonna go over and see Saget and get a picture with him, because I have  my camera.  And it's weird, because he starts going, is that Jim Norton?  Jim, get him over here.  I was like, fuck.  I got all the Adam Dubin movies.  I've seen all your fun, dirty shit.  Yeah, the Sidesplitters.  I laugh at you.  The gynecologist.  Gynecologist, yeah.  American Dummy.  I love American Dummy.  American Dummy.  That's Otto and George.  Yeah.  He's got it all together.  Okay, then.  American Cock.  The weirdest thing for me is that compliment, which is, I always hated you and wanted you 
[11:12:00]  dead.  Now I like you.  It's like, let me just clear my memory on the thing that I am hating you.  No, but actually, I can't.  That sums up our show right there.  I get it a lot.  But that's okay, man.  You know, if people want to do over and let me, I'm funny.  The only thing I'm confident in is I know I'm funny.  That's the only thing I'm confident in.  The rest of it, I can fucking, I can't figure nothing out.  You ever think of doing a DVD and narrating over it, like with stuff that you could do,  like the Rodney King beating, the Reginald Pena beating?  They made it.  They made it. 
[11:12:30]  Did they really?  They took clips from the video show and faces of death, and they intercut them, and I've  seen it.  They sent it to me, and it's me going,  here's something that happens around the house, and they got the senator that blows  his brains out, and they put Zabruder on it, and they put the shuttle on it, and I stopped.  At first, I laughed, and people in the audience throwing their heads back and shit, and then  I stopped laughing, because I can't watch Snuff.  I just can't watch it.  I don't like that either.  I can make it, but I can't watch it.  Snuff's just one take, and you're out. 
[11:13:00]  You don't have to reshoot.  There's no coverage.  No cat party at the end?  Snuff's just me and a bottle of George Dickel.  I always hated you, but now I whack myself to yourself.

That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?

I'm hungry for a hard-tailed cock.  Yes.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, juicy cock from Ben the other day. 
[11:15:00]  Oh.  I like the banana.  Oh, God.  I like the banana.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy something in my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.

Let's see how this comes out.  All right?  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got a break.  I'm going to put it on the station. 
[11:20:00]  Ah, this is nice.  Oh, yeah.  This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  Oh, wait, yo.  Oh, wait, yo.  He's laid that night.  And now he has nowhere to go. 
[11:20:30]  My money's gone and off to all my friends.  And the cop says to me,  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says,  And you know I have an angel.  And he says,  That angel.  Shelter me from the falling rain.

[11:21:30]  And just a little peace.  Danny, one of our favorite characters from the show is Steve from Yellowstone.  I don't know.  I kind of like Danny from W-Town myself.  Yeah, he's pretty good.  But sometimes when we have a particularly bad guest, Steve from Yellowstone will call in and give that guest the what for.  I believe this time around it was a guy who did a one-man Star Wars show.  And Steve from Yellowstone just needed to voice his opinion. 
[11:22:00]  Here it is.  Thank you.  There's no better person to be introing this bit than C-3PO himself.  Obi-Anne Anthony's best pick.  Seth, Steve from Yellowstone call in.  Ramone!  Let's say hi to Charles Ross.  One-man Star Wars show.  How's it going?  How's it going, mister? 
[11:22:30]  One-man show.  Yeah.  Based on Star Wars.  Based on Star Wars.  It is Star Wars, essentially.  It's Star Wars.  That's the whole thing.  The definitive Star Wars.  I wouldn't say definitive.  I would say sort of the bastardization of it.  Bastardization.  Where do you do this?  Well, here I'm doing it in New York at the Lamb's Theater, which is 130 West 44th.  It's kind of weird, man.  Like, this is a comedy sketch that went really, really wrong.  Isn't it like Broadway over there?  Yeah, it is.  Well, it's considered off-Broadway.  Off-Broadway.  And I'm definitely the most off thing on Broadway.  There's no...  So you're playing this as an off-Broadway show you're doing. 
[11:23:00]  Well, I mean, I got my licensing agreements and stuff like that, so, I mean, I don't feel  too bad about it.  Can you do it for us?  The whole thing?  Or just a piece of it?  The whole thing.  How long is it?  It's an hour.  Well, we've got about an hour left in the show.  It's an hour, Sean.  Can you cut the 54?  I could do it, but I'd sweat all over the place and be positively disgusted.  What exactly is the theme of the show?  Well, okay, imagine you just take, you know, Star Wars and take all the tech out of it.  So it's just me doing, like, all the voices, all the, like, the music and stuff.  It's kind of a dumb idea.  And it kind of is dumb for the first five minutes, but I think people kind of dig it because 
[11:23:30]  people know Star Wars pretty well.  Do you get a lot of geeks in there?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  For sure.  There's a high geek sort of concentration.  Do you use props?  No.  No.  It's just you.  It's just me.  And your voice.  Yeah.  It's a really stupid idea.  I mean, I thought it was a dumb idea.  I will not argue with you.  Way to get people to buy tickets.  Do you have music that plays?  No.  No.  It's just you.  Do you use a microphone or do you yell?  Yeah, I do use a microphone.  I mean, you and a mic.  Yeah.  Well, I've played it for, like, 3,500 people. 
[11:24:00]  Just a...  Underneath.  Underneath, I wear a kiln.  Yeah.  Do you wear just regular clothes or is it...  No, no.  It's like a person that would work on an airplane, like a flight suit type thing.  Oh.  Just something really boring.  But it's black.  It's supposed to be really neutral.  And, yeah.  Once again, I never thought this idea would work, but that was about three years ago and  I've been doing it ever since.  And who came up to you and said, this can be off-Broadway?  Nobody.  Nobody.  It was actually...  I met this guy when I was touring it on this thing, the Fringe Tour, which, I mean, 
[11:24:30]  there's American cities that do the Fringe and there's Canadian cities.  I'm from Canada.  And now it makes perfect sense.  Now it makes perfect sense.  I was thinking, like, wait, wait, this is a little odd.  Canadian.  There was something in the water.  Right.  So do you feel like you've seen the new ones, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I've seen some of the old ones.  My friend watched the new ones.  Yeah.  And he thinks that a lot of the technology and stuff has kind of surpassed a lot of what  Lucas originally kind of intended to be, you know, like his whole thing. 
[11:25:00]  Like the space sort of cowboy western thing?  Well, um...  Well, I don't know, man.  I think the new things are made for new kids.  Like, you know, they're just made to...  I mean, they sell toys.  They get the kids to come out.  You know, they're sort of the helium-infused weird little character.  I don't know.  They're not up my alley, but when I was a kid and watched the old Star Wars films...  So you were a big fan.  Oh, when I was a kid.  Yeah, absolutely.  What was your favorite part of the original?  The original? 
[11:25:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  There was too many parts.  Actually, I really liked the evil guy, the emperor.  I mean, I thought he was sort of like...  Oh, really?  Well, he's like the perfect...  Not many people pick that.  Really?  That guy.  I thought he was just like the perfect sarcastic bastard, and he was perfect.  Usually Vader or, you know...  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was cool.  But, you know, it's kind of hard to believe that, you know, a guy with a voice  that cool could have given, or been sort of the seed of Luke, you know, the little  whiny...  Yeah, I know.  He's whined through the entire movie.  But if you watch the old films, or the new films now, you can see how much the Canadian  guy who plays Anakin Skywalker... 
[11:26:00]  Yeah, he's a whiny bastard, too.  Now, obviously you were a big fan because you must have done the impressions.  Yeah.  Do you do the good impressions of this?  I wouldn't say there are good impressions, but some of them are good impressions.  Some of them are good.  Some of them aren't so good, like Yoda sucks, whereas Admiral Ackbar, do you know who I'm  talking about?  Yeah, the fish-eyed...  Yeah, that's him, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I do a pretty good version of that, which is kind of cool, because today  I got an audition for a Star Wars video game.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Only through being in New York could you possibly get an audition to do, like, a Star Wars video 
[11:26:30]  game.  Where they actually need an Admiral Ackbar.  And what about some of the sound effects?  Obviously, the lightsaber would be a big one.  I mean, it sounds really dumb.  Absolutely.  No, it sounds kind of cool.  But the point is that you get into the context of the show, right?  And, like, how is it going to work?  Is it going to work or not going to work?  Yeah.  And, um...  I mean, I can give you guys, like, a two-minute bit from the show, if you will.  Absolutely.  Yeah?  I'd love to hear it.  Okay, this here is the trash compactor scene from the first film.  And just bear with me.  Should I watch or kind of shut my eyes and imagine? 
[11:27:00]  Oh, let's all imagine.  You want us all imagine?  Okay, audience, even if you're driving, shut your eyes.  No.  Well, let's here.  I'll stand up.  Can I move the microphone?  Yeah, you should stand up.  Oh, yeah.  And, of course, we want the listeners to comment.  Serious comments about...  Serious.  Yes, we got a lot of clowns that want to call them, but we want serious comments.  Well, Charles Ross, the one-man Star Wars show.  Here's the scene.  Get behind me.  Get behind me.  This is some rescue.  You got in.  You didn't have a plan for getting out?  Well, he's the brain, sweetheart.  What the hell are you doing?  Something has to save us kids. 
[11:27:30]  In the garbage soup, fly boy.  Get in there, big woolly oaf.  I don't care what you smell.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Wonderful girl.  I'm going to kill her and begin to like her.  Get in there.  Ah, the garbage chute.  What a wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you discovered.  Well, it could be worse. 
[11:28:00]  It's worse.  There's something alive in here.  Something just swam past my leg.  Look, did you see that?  Kid, Luke.  Kid, Luke.  Blasted will you hand my gun stamped.  Where?  Oh, anywhere.  Kid, Luke.  Kid, Luke.  Grab him.  What happened? 
[11:28:30]  I don't know.  Just let go of me and disappeared.  The walls are closing in.  Don't you stand there?  Try to brace him or something.  Wait a minute.  3PO?  Come here, 3PO.  3PO.  3PO.  Oh, where could he be?  3PO.  3PO.  Are you there, sir?  3PO.  We've had some problems.  Will you shut him?  Listen to me.  Shut down all the garbage smashes on the detention level.  Do you copy? 
[11:29:00]  Shut down all the garbage smashes on the detention level.  No, shut them all down.  Hurry.  Hey, you did it, 3PO.  Oh, look.  Listen to them, R2.  They're dying.  Oh, curse my metal body.  It wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault.  My fault.  We're all right.  You did great.  Ha ha.  Where are we?  3, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 7.  And that's how it goes.  Wow.  But for now.  Wow.  Why did you chuck all the chips across the table?  The poker chips. 
[11:29:30]  That's the blessing of the poker chips.  The blessing.  The blessing of the poker chips.  The only thing I see is I did not hear Chewbacca.  Oh, well, he'd be like,  I heard that.  Oh, I didn't catch it.  Okay.  All right.  Now, you do that for an hour straight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At that speed.  Faster.  There's no...  No break.  No pauses like they would normally pause between these lines.  You just rattle it out.  Well, I mean, there's a little bit of break.  Yeah.  I don't know.  How much of the...  You do the entire movie. 
[11:30:00]  Well, I mean, it's like the...  It's the Reader's Digest version.  It's, like, been really super condensed now.  Yeah.  And I do Lord of the Rings as well, which is just dumb.  But anyway, it works.  Wow.  Yeah, you...  Okay, but...  Okay, there's this big, big, giant dork convention,  a Star Wars convention called Celebration 3,  which happened in Indianapolis.  And, I mean, you get 3,500 people watching this show at a time.  Yeah.  Which is really, really strange.  I don't know, man.  I don't doubt it.  Wow.  Yeah.  I mean, like, movie screens on the other side of the audience 
[11:30:30]  or on the other side of the stage and then out over the audience.  And you'd never think that there could be that many people that know Star Wars that well.  And what's the reaction as you're doing it?  Are they laughing?  Are they...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  For sure.  For sure.  And they're watching...  Well, for some people, it's just like watching a kid in the basement  or something like that.  Yeah.  For other people, it's about being able to sort of celebrate  their own personal infatuation with Star Wars, you know?  Yeah.  So, you either find people that really are laughing at it  and other people that are laughing sort of with you.  Yeah.  So, it's really strange to have.  Wow. 
[11:31:00]  Well, you've taken something and ran with it.  Yeah.  That...  That...  Congratulations.  Cheers.  Thank you.  And best of luck to you with your one-man show.  Well, we got...  We got some phone calls coming in.  We have Jimmy Robinson on the phone.  Jimmy.  Hey, this is Jimmy from New Jersey.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, man?  Hey, um...  Do you do this scene?  I like this scene in Star Wars when, um...  When he, like, had the fight and then there's just the empty robe with no one in it. 
[11:31:30]  Yeah.  Do you do that one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you do the Robert Reed version?  The Robert Reed version.  Were you going to even die?  Yeah, yeah.  You stink.  Hey, serious calls only, you asshole.  Dude, this is what happens now.  We get a guest on the show.  This is textbook.  Oh.  Get a guest on the show and people call up and no matter how much we tell them,  we just want serious calls, the assholes get through.  You stink.  Do you get a lot of criticism?  You are at stinks.  Do you get a lot of criticism?  There's a lot of criticism, and that's really high-brow criticism, man. 
[11:32:00]  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm crushed.  The thing is, I think based upon that kind of a phone call, I'm pretty much, you know,  resolved not to do the show anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm sure that guy was...  That was the last time, guys, you're ever going to hear it.  Loser sitting in his apartment, probably getting prostitutes at night to piss on him.  Well, let's say hi to Dr. Frank Davis.  Dr. Frank Davis.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I'm a doctor at Bellevue, a psychiatrist.  Listen, just keep him distracted.  We're sending a few guys down to get him.  You stink, you nut job. 
[11:32:30]  Thank you.  Let's say hi to...  Let's say hi to...  Let's go to Ben in Boston.  Ben?  Ben!  Ben!  You like that, huh, Ben?  Ben?  Yeah, can you just see where the Falcon goes and pick up Tom Brady?  We all just go...  Seems to be doing his own one-man show all day long.  I think this guy enjoyed it.  Ben from Boston.  Holy man, I've got to get there to Boston. 
[11:33:00]  Yeah.  Any ideas of maybe taking it on the road?  It's been on the road for the last three years, man.  Really?  So you're not just here in New York, you'll be going other places?  No, there's this thing called Clear Channel.  Which I'm sure we're all aware of.  Yes, everybody is aware of.  And I'm going to...  At least with the Lord of the Rings show, I'm going to be going to South Africa and Singapore.  You're shitting me.  Man, I really...  Is there good money in this?  I haven't had another job for the last four years, man.  Have you had to pay Lucas anything?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you get a proper licensing agreement. 
[11:33:30]  Yeah.  If you don't do that, you can, you know...  Yeah, that'll cost you.  So, I mean, it's weird.  I really never intended for this show to go as it has, and I'm really glad that it has.  What, was it just kind of a hobby?  No, it was a...  I mean, I was working as an actor, and one day, like, literally, I wrote this comedy sketch,  and when I say it went really wrong, it went really, really right or really, really wrong,  because I didn't think people would be able to sort of keep up with it, and people have  been able to keep up with it, so this has kind of almost left my own hands. 
[11:34:00]  I find myself here, not intending to come here to New York to bring this here, but,  you know, it's, you know, kind of go bigger or go back home, and, I mean, I don't have  a problem doing it, and...  You're going to franchise it out?  No, I don't think so.  Get some other actors to do it, and you just sit home and pocket some cash?  That would be nice, but I'd turn into Jabba the Hutt and lose my leg.  That's it.  Why don't we go to Steve in Yellowstone?  Steve in Yellowstone.  Steve? 
[11:34:30]  Hi, I just wanted to know if you had any type of a copyright problem when you were dealing  with George Lucas, like I've had sometimes on my website.  Yeah, I mean, it is a copyright problem, because it is, you know, a matter of...  Ramon, bring me someone with talent.  What the fuck are you talking about, you fucking retard?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, have fun in Yellowstone, buddy.  Maybe you can sit on, like, you know, the old faithful and have it go up your ass, you  stupid piece of shit.  Wow, man.  I'm absolutely, you know, crushed down to my very foundations, man. 
[11:35:00]  I just don't...  This is amazing.  All right, thank you, Steve in Yellowstone.  Hey, man.  Good luck.  A guy is successful taking something and using his talent to get out on stage and actually  do it.  Yeah, and did you, you've been an actor, you said?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean...  So now you're finally doing something that's working, you're making my... and people just  can't seem to deal with that.  Steve?  Well, at least not the people that are calling in here.  God, man.  No, I think it's pretty impressive.  Steve.  Something. 
[11:35:30]  You want to do another scene, or...?  Ah, no, no.  That's fine, actually.  I mean, not many of the scenes from the show really work purely on radio, like, because  a lot of it doesn't really all stick together.  But, I mean, like, you get something like, you know, ho, ho, ho, ho, shibiki, ma garbawarpa,  kawawuki, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Which is obviously, you know...  Jabba.  No, it's Princess Leia.  But, you know...  Of course.  Yeah.  I mean, there's scenes that people definitely recognize, and there's characters, like, you  know, people recognize, right?  Yes. 
[11:36:00]  And I'm like, hmm...  Of course.  Yeah.  But, um...  Yeah.  It's weird, man.  Like, you kind of have to see it on stage in order to really get the full idea of it.  That's why it's a stage show, and you don't have a CD out.  Do you have a CD out?  No.  Not a CD or a DVD.  See?  And that's another thing, man.  Like, if...  It's a weird thing with, you know, copyright material, you know...  You can only do this in one medium, live, like that.  If you wanted to put a CD out, you'd have to pay Lucas more money.  Ah, yeah.  I don't think I could ever get the rights to do it.  No?  No, not really.  And that's okay.  I mean, it's something I wouldn't want to franchise out, because as long as I can do it, I'll continue doing it. 
[11:36:30]  Right.  And I hopefully will not be a 65-year-old man, you know, like, the one-man Star Wars trilogy, you know, like...  Yeah.  ...nattering out on stage to...  That'd be a little rough.  ...listen to the screams of a person in Yellowstone National Park.  Sounds like you need some more powerful lungs.  That guy was just an ass.  Oh, well.  So, what are the details?  The show is here in New York, right?  It is indeed, yeah.  It plays every night at 8 o'clock, except for Wednesdays.  Right now, we have matinees at 3 o'clock.  And it's going to be changing the schedule up a bit. 
[11:37:00]  We'll still have the shows at 8 o'clock every night, but we'll have a 3 o'clock matinee on Saturday and Sunday.  Mm-hmm.  And you can get tickets by calling telecharge.  Jimmy, you missed it.  What happened?  You all right?  Yes.  I was trying to get some production stuff, because they're...  Oh.  Yeah.  It's always the way.  Yes.  Well, Charles, thank you very much.  Oh, thanks for having me, guys.  We're coming in.  Sorry about the goddamn phone calls.  You were in 15 minutes, why are you?  Jackasses.  That's all right.  Yeah, it's just production stuff that Ben was supposed to do and did not do. 
[11:37:30]  Oh.  Can you do...  Thank you.  Can you do C-3PO?  C-3PO.  R-2-D-2, where are you?  Yeah.  Can you do...  I pardon you.  Jesus.  I pardon you.  They could just go on and on.  How about...  I don't know all the characters.  I was at the yesterday.  I was like...  R-2?  I know R-2.  Yeah, R-2.  Well, if you don't know the show, I mean, if you don't know the movies, it's...  No, I saw the first one, but I don't know any of the new guys.  I do know R-2 with my slide whistle. 
[11:38:00]  Yeah, see?  You need a prop.  I feel like a prop sometimes.  Oh, don't you sweat it.  I won't.  I like seeing a successful guy.  Of course.  Cheers, guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Thank you.  Charles Ross.  One-man Star Wars show.  And there he goes.  We should take a break, I think, huh?  Charles?  We're going to take a break.  We're going to regroup, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show in a few moments. 
[11:38:30]  Yeah?  Yeah?  We're going to continue in a couple of moments.  What happened?  No audio.  You're good.  Holy shit.  What happened?  Oh, was he fucking pissed.  Why?  Livid.  He just walked out, by the way.  That wasn't a take it easy.  He immediately left.  And he, yeah, just...  Did he cut some liners?  No.  He took off before his crew here even knew that he was gone.  He was already out the door.  And they were like, oh, he left already.  And they took off after him.  Someone followed him.  What the cell phone?  Wow. 
[11:39:00]  Is he pissed off.  See, what's wrong?  Yeah.  Someone who has balls?  See, what's...  Hurry up, Hawke.  See, what's we're going to ask him, you know, if everything went okay?  Well, that stupid caller from Yellowstone pissed him off.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Derek.  Creative little boy.  Steve from Yellowstone.  I sometimes have problems.  Hello?  No?  I thought we had somebody.  What's the problem?  Oh, wait.  Here we go.  Eric.  Yeah.  What's up? 
[11:39:30]  Hey.  Hang on one second.  Hey, before you guys go, can they talk to you one more time?  About the lampseater and everything.  About the plug, because he didn't say the lampseater and all that.  He did.  The lampseater?  Can they talk to you one more time?  Just...  We don't think it went well.  We want to ask him why he left angry.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hey.  Charles, you're not mad, are you?  No, it's just...  What happened?  It's all right, man.  No, what happened?  The theater is 1.30 West 44. 
[11:40:00]  No, but the thing was, you seemed like you left when you were mad.  Yeah, I know.  I just had...  You know, it's just kind of shitty.  The phone call's coming in, and I don't know.  I kind of feel like it's an uphill battle, man.  I was puking all yesterday, and I've been puking this morning.  I'm really kind of sick, so it's not your fault.  It's me.  Charles.  The audience, too.  Charles, there's only three phone calls.  I know.  I know, man.  Out of the three we took.  That's not that bad.  It's not your guys' fault, man.  I'm just being a big baby, so... 
[11:40:30]  Yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah, but why are you being a baby?  All right.  You're very talented, obviously, and the show's doing very well.  No, it's going well, man.  What kind of...  You're not sick like a flu or something, are you?  Yeah, I've had the flu for like the last couple of days.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Hope you didn't bring it in here.  I hope I did.  Why?  Where's the...  Charles, are you mad at us, though?  No.  No.  God, no, man.  Not at all.  Who are you mad at?  Just the whole guys calling in and stuff like that.  Yeah. 
[11:41:00]  We get that, though, every day.  We get people call up and back.  It happens.  We get y'all, too.  You know, you do put yourself out there, and it's like, I'm pretty easy to kick in the  balls.  And I try to always kibosh the people trying to kick me in the balls beforehand.  Yeah.  You know, and it's like...  That Steve guy calls every day, though.  Yeah, Steve calls us and bashes us every day.  You should hear what he says about us every day.  Steve in Yellowstone stinks, and that guy, Ben in Boston, is awful, if you understand what  he's saying.  They're like regular callers that we can't screen out that just call up and bash us and 
[11:41:30]  our guests all the time.  Yeah.  That guy drives a hybrid car, for God's sake.  Enough said.  Yeah.  I just, you know, when you feel sick and, you know, you try to put it out there, it  just, I don't know, it feels like an uphill battle.  No, you did not.  Oh, you scumbag. 
[11:42:00]  Holy shit.  He's talking about the uphill battle.  Oh, you didn't.  Gotta give the guy credit, though.  I threw that entire poker chip thing at him, and he didn't even flinch.  He didn't even miss a...  He didn't even stop.  You can act like a man!  What's the matter with you?  Why is it Eric calling back? 
[11:42:30]  Hopefully he's got a fist in his gum line.  Dude, I just...  Frunk.  She had fucking mayonnaise leaking out of his teeth.  Good shot to the mouth.  Right now, that dummy is trying to explain why, like, the phone hung up, and it's still  showing the minutes they're taking.  Like, no, I...  Yeah, let's get him back on the phone.  What happened?  Are you kidding?  Why'd he hang up on us? 
[11:43:00]  Okay.  Eric, why do you...  Yeah, the phone must have cut out or something.  Ah, damn it.  All right.  Hold on.  That wasn't me hanging up.  No?  All right.  We thought, because right when that happened, we were like, uh-oh, he's pissed.  Yeah, we don't want...  No, we don't want you going away mad, and we want to give you the final word here.  So, uh, Charles.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Charles.  So, what were you saying?  Um, I don't know what I was saying.  I guess it's just...  You're saying you were feeling sick or something like that?  It's just about weird...  Yeah, I had to do, like, two shows yesterday, and it was, like... 
[11:43:30]  Like, wolfing between the shows.  I don't know.  Everybody's got some kind of cold of some sort.  No, it was something about an uphill battle, and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you're easy to get to, and you're working on that or something like that?  What's that?  You said something about...  And it was the thought kind of got cut off.  It's like you were easy to kick in the balls or get to, and you're feeling...  Oh, yeah.  It's like an uphill battle.  Try doing this type of show here, right?  And, like, you know, sometimes trying to maintain a sense of, like, feeling good about yourself.  You know, it's such a strange thing to be doing, because, like... 
[11:44:00]  I can't be part of this.  This show stinks.  You feel good about yourself.  Ka-ching.  You know, right now...  That's hard sometimes.  Click.  And right now, Eric is trying to explain why it once again cut off, and why the mouthpiece 
[11:44:30]  smells like the inside of a baby coffin.  Oh, shit.  Breathe.  Nope.  All right.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Eric, what happened?  He came back in.  He followed me in.  He wants to come back in.  Oh.  And we've moved.  All right. 
[11:45:00]  No, no, no.  Let me get out of the studio first, because I've got to call him again.  Yeah.  You can tell him I want to...  Now, keep his hand loose.  Just take him to the back.  Away from that window.  I know.  Where's Ben?  Ben's in the back.  Dude.  What the hell is going on?  Oh, Jesus.  That's too funny.  Hey, there he is.  I don't know what's going on with the phone.  Were you in the elevator area?  No, I was going to the bathroom.  Oh, no.  No, that...  No.  Why?  No, it's not you guys at all, man. 
[11:45:30]  Yeah, I've had...  On my days off, I got to look after my girlfriend and our two friends that came from Victoria to  visit us, and they were puking, like, lying down on, like, the couch and on the bed, just  barfing in bags and stuff, so...  What's Victoria?  Canada?  Yeah, British Columbia.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Where are you from up there?  Victoria.  Victoria?  I live in Victoria, but, I mean, I was born in this place called Prince George, B.C., which...  Did you ever see the movie Strange Brew?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[11:46:00]  Yeah, with Rick Moran.  That's all we know of Canada, is through Strange Brew.  Well, it was filmed in Prince George, B.C.  That's where I was born and where I kind of grew up, until I was, like, 11 years old  or something, and I watched...  Oh, thank you.  I'm not sure if they ever told you, but I'd watched the Star Wars trilogy, like, over  400 times before I was 11 years old.  Oh, you did?  Mm-hmm.  Why?  It was just your thing?  We didn't have television.  We had an 8-11, and we had a VCR, and it didn't have cable.  It was very cool when you were a kid.  I mean, I watched that movie, I can't even tell you how many times, too.  No.  As a kid? 
[11:46:30]  I mean, sitting there, you had the opening scene, first time you ever saw it?  Yeah.  It was the best thing ever.  Yeah, I know.  Of course.  But, I mean, I put it on, like, sort of as background noise.  Do you know what I mean?  Really?  In the morning.  Just...  Wait, you just had no TV?  Did you get the whole movie memorized?  No.  Word for word?  No?  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  I mean, when I wrote this, though, it was going from memory, rather than going back and  watching the films and trying to...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So, there could be some inaccuracies.  Oh, huge inaccuracies.  And you get people telling me that I've got this wrong, or that wording wrong, or something  wrong, and it's like, well, who cares? 
[11:47:00]  They're probably dressed like Jedi, with lightsabers in their hands when they tell you this.  Oh, yeah, man.  I've met a lot of those people.  You've been to the conventions?  Well, just to perform, I've never actually been to a convention.  Yeah.  Outside of a...  Scary people.  Well, some, but a lot of these people have really normal jobs and normal lives, too, right?  Like, they just...  They do normal things, except that this is their hobby, so...  Well, you've got a lot of action on the phones.  I mean, they're just going crazy.  Oh, great.  We've got a call coming in from Riskless, Montana.  Well, let's do it.  This is Travis.  Travis!  Hey, dude, why are they giving you such a hard time? 
[11:47:30]  I thought it was pretty good what you did.  Oh, thanks.  Good.  Yeah, there you go.  See, that's positive.  I told you.  I'm a fan of the movie.  I mean, it's hard to find somebody that kind of knows everything about the movie, and everybody  thinks I'm a geek, but I like the movie.  Well, there's nothing wrong with that.  People think I'm a geek, too.  How old were you when you started, like, watching the movies and stuff?  How old was I?  You said he saw the movie 400 times before he was 11, I think.  First time I saw it was in Waikiki.  We used to live between Waikiki and Prince George, so the first time I saw it was near  the Waikiki Banyan, if you've ever been to Waikiki. 
[11:48:00]  What?  What?  Did you just...  Oh, it's this guy again.  Did you just squeal off the road again, buddy?  Is this Steve?  Tell this guy to talk.  Ramon, this guy sucks black dick.  Why do the screeners...  No, this guy tricked us.  The screeners can't find out that that's not Travis?  Ramon, Star Wars is a faggot. 
[11:48:30]  All right, we get it.  Ramon, tell this guy to talk.  Steve.  Steve, please lose the phone number.  Where do you live, man?  Yeah.  Ramon, tell this guy to talk to you.  I'm real.  Holy shit, dude.  The guy's cracking himself up.  This is awesome.  All right, Steve.  Do you want my home number, fuckhead?  Really?  You know, they're faceless people.  I love it. 
[11:49:00]  Like message board people.  Ramon!  They love jumping in and bashing, but they never want to confront anybody.  Come down to the studio.  We'll kick your ass.  Yeah, why don't you come in the studio, buddy?  Steve.  Go find your boyfriend, Ramon, or whatever the hell.  Why don't you come in the studio?  If you had balls.  All right, there he goes.  Jesus.  Sorry about that, buddy.  It's a daily battle on this show to deal with these assholes. 
[11:49:30]  Brian Clifton, what's up?  Hey, this is Brian from Clifton Park.  Hey, Brian.  I saw him at Celebration 3.  I loved him.  I really did.  Oh, okay.  All this crap they're giving you is a bunch of bullshit.  Saw the show?  You're very talented.  I love the films.  You know, what people do, it's a great film, and I can't believe that people are dissing  him like this.  It's a bunch of jack-offs.  You're always going to get it.  Keep doing what you're doing.  I saw it at Celebration 3.  Keep it up.  I'm punching out.  You're always going to get the one or two.  What they call the bad apples. 
[11:50:00]  So what is with Ramon?  I don't get it.  Every time this Steve guy calls, it's always about Ramon.  We still don't know what it means.  But he actually listens to the radio and then bothers to call in.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he does.  He actually listens and then calls in to bash.  Is he like your sort of village idiot?  Yeah, every day.  Every day.  Every day.  Every day we've got to deal with this shit.  Ramon. 
[11:50:30]  Ramon.  Who cares, Ramon?  Dan in New Hampshire checking in.  Let's say hi to Liddy.  Liddy.  Hey, how are you doing?  Hello?  Liddy.  What's up, Liddy?  Why is everybody giving this guy a hard time?  Liddy, you stink.  Ramon.  All right.  Come here again.  Ramon.  Darth Vader has AIDS.  Holy shit, dude.  Would you? 
[11:51:00]  Why do you call?  Ramon.  T3PO should be molested.  Wash my balls.  He's got an...  He's Liddy.  Liddy and Ramon.  Like, what the hell?  Liddy.  This is Liddy.  Ramon.  Ramon is going to be an awful producer.  He needs a writer, obviously.  You've got no material, dude.  Ramon.  Why are Ryan says hiring that lazy bag of shit? 
[11:51:30]  I don't even know what he's talking about.  All right.  Wow.  Thank you, Liddy.  God damn.  So he's like an honorary DJ or like on the...  Honorary?  The Eye in the Sky or something like that?  Yeah.  For some reason, he's very good at getting past the screeners.  Let's go to the Ramon part.  Any more Steve from Yellowstone calls and you guys are done.  I mean, Jesus.  Check the caller ID.  Yeah.  Don't we have caller ID?  Ben, what's up? 
[11:52:00]  Yo, what's up?  I want him to do Yoda eating Princess Leia's ass.  Ramon.  No, this is not Ramon.  This is somebody totally new.  Yeah, do you do that, though?  Seriously, if you do all the voices, do you mess around with the voices a little bit?  No, not really.  Do an alternate scene?  Well, no eating of Leia's ass.  No.  But that would be great.  Any other movies that you have in mind to take into this?  I was thinking in terms of endearment.  Terms of endearment.  Yeah, that would be great.  How about Blowing Chewbacca? 
[11:52:30]  Blowing Chewbacca.  All right.  Let's say...  Look at the size of that thing.  I think Star Wars The Wrath of Khan.  Star Trek The Wrath of Khan would probably be a good one.  Good choice.  Sonny Ferelli, what's up?  Hey, this guy's really good, man.  Oh.  Ramon.  All right.  Yeah, you know something?  Your book is doing an excellent job.  What's his name, Ramon?  Punching out.  That's not even...  Steve.  I don't even get that one.  All right.  Frenchie.  Hey.  This guy is very good. 
[11:53:00]  Why is everybody giving him shit?  Ramon.  Is that the real Frenchie?  Yes.  And you like...  You like...  Yes, I like him.  He's good.  Oh, okay.  He does a good job.  Come to my restaurant.  Oh, plug your restaurant.  Ramon, this guy sucks.  Ramon.  Ramon, bring this guy a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  All right.  Look.  I've had it. 
[11:53:30]  I have had it.  Bring me a hybrid vehicle.  Ramon.  You really got to bring this guy on, man.  Bring me a belly the size of a change purse.  Oh, Jesus, guys.  Look.  Shave my arms.  All right.  Thank you, Frenchie.  All right.  Thanks.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, Charles. 
[11:54:00]  Charles Walker.  Charles, again.  And Star Wars show.  Again.  Thank you very much.  Also, I believe in the new year, we're going to be opening up the one-man Lord of the Rings  probably in the same space as well.  Right here in New York.  Yeah, yeah.  Very cool.  Can you give us a little taste of that?  Sure.  We wants it.  We needs it.  Must have the precious.  Master is our friend.  You don't have any friends.  Nobody likes you.  I'm not listening.  You're a liar and a thief.  Nope.  Murderer.  I hate you. 
[11:54:30]  What are you with me?  Oh, oh, oh.  It was me.  We survived because of me.  Not anymore.  What?  We don't need you.  Leave now and never come back.  Leave now and never come back.  Anyway.  Wow.  That's pretty damn good.  No more chips done at me, though.  This is good.  Well, what's up, Jimmy? 
[11:55:00]  Did he get the...  Yeah, he's getting the auction stuff all together.  Okay.  Cool.  Very good.  All right.  Charles did a great job for us today.  Thanks so much.  Feel better.  All right.  I will.  I hope so.  All right.  Cheers.  Opie and Anthony's best bits.  Best audio sent in by a listener.  Are you kidding me?  Ha ha, they all suck.  Ah, right.  Manhattan mimosa.
