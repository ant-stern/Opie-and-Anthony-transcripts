<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," a listener segment encouraging the display of "WOW" stickers on vehicles to provoke reactions from women. Opie admitted to enthusiastically honking at cars with the stickers.  This transitioned into a discussion about a mistakenly reported tsunami warning in California following an earthquake, which led to jokes about the Payne Stewart plane crash anniversary and humorous, often insensitive, golf anecdotes, including a story about Michael Douglas and his caddy.  A caller, George from Missouri, shared his "WOW" sticker experience, describing a near-accident caused by a woman's exhibitionist behavior while driving.  Further discussion ensued regarding rapid decompression in airplanes, referencing the Payne Stewart crash, with additional listener calls and anecdotes.

The show then heavily featured Jim Norton's recent appearances on *The Tonight Show* and Bravo, comparing the professional environments to their own radio show.  This segued into a lengthy discussion about obese individuals on airplanes, sparked by Jim Norton's experience with a large passenger. The hosts and callers shared numerous anecdotes about uncomfortable encounters with overweight passengers, expressing frustration and making highly offensive and derogatory comments about obese people.  The conversation touched on societal acceptance of obesity, compared to other addictions, and included a caller discussing weight loss challenges. Martini Steve, present in the studio, mentioned his gastric bypass surgery.

A subsequent segment focused on weight loss and gastric bypass surgery, with Steve recounting his 135-pound weight loss and the psychological aspects of obesity.  Callers Brian and J.R. shared their own weight loss experiences, with Brian detailing gastric bypass side effects and J.R. describing his success through diet and exercise.  This section included tangents about a caller's shorts, a bizarre anecdote about Tito Ortiz allegedly choking Steve, and inappropriate jokes about body parts.  The discussion then shifted to a news story about a child's death on Epcot's Mission Space ride, followed by listener accounts and the hosts' outrage regarding the lack of age restrictions and the ride's reopening.

The show moved on to a discussion about a New York Post cartoon depicting Michael Jackson's acquittal, and Geraldo Rivera's reaction to the trial and his relationship with Jackson.  Audio clips of Geraldo were played, mocked by the hosts, along with discussions of media coverage, Geraldo's past journalistic errors, and Jackson's eccentricities. This included a discussion about celebrity endorsements and deodorant, with a demonstration by guest Adam Ferrari spraying deodorant into the studio microphone.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on the Michael Jackson trial, criticizing the prosecution's perceived incompetence and the defense's effectiveness, particularly contrasting Larry King's interview of Jackson's lawyer with the O.J. Simpson trial. The conversation included discussion of movie remakes, criticizing Roger Ebert's review of a *Honeymooners* remake, a new song by Half Man Wonder ("Whip-a-Mow"), and allegations that producer Eric had deleted critical audio of the show.  Jokes from Jay Leno and David Letterman on the Michael Jackson trial and further discussion of the Ebert review concluded this segment.

The "True Confessions" segment featured a listener, Eric, sharing an explicit sexual fantasy, which was then used for a new audio sweeper. This led to a discussion about home invasions, home security, self-defense, and humorous, potentially offensive scenarios involving weaponry and LARPing. Mary Carey, a pornographic actress, joined the show, discussing her attendance at a Republican fundraiser, her encounters with Republican men, Secret Service personnel, NBA players, and various sex toys, including explicit details of her experiences.

Two callers, Chris and Doug OutDoug, shared their experiences with sex toys, providing explicit details of their usage. Doug recounted a bizarre incident involving his ex-wife using his alleged involvement with the show to influence their child custody agreement.  The show concluded with discussions about prison-made sex toys, Mary Carey's upcoming appearance on *The Daily Show*, and further humorous anecdotes.

The final segment heavily criticized Kobe Bryant, calling him derogatory names, for his perceived role in the departures of Shaquille O'Neal and Phil Jackson. Audio clips of Shaq and Jackson were played, and the hosts speculated on the reasons for their departures. This was followed by a discussion of the NBA Finals, a running joke about a misinterpreted "cracker" joke, a clip of Virginia Graham uncontrollably laughing on 60 Minutes, and a call from Morgan Spurlock promoting his show, *30 Days*. The hosts also mentioned upcoming stand-up appearances, including Adam Ferrara's and their own, and Tyson Walter briefly joined at the end.

[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  We're all resistant to the onslaught of the communist masters of deceit. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  And yeah, we're back.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for proper.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  Don't do it.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Mom!  I love the old.  I have to do this now. 
[00:05:00]  Mom!  Please stop calling me.  Morning, Mr. Batman!  Can I have that mixed-up cheese cereal?  Okay!  I pity the boy, fool.  Don't eat that cereal.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want some tears to come out of my eyes?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Wow!  Eh, eh, eh.  Are you ready? 
[00:05:30]  Are you ready?  Wow!  Wow!  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hey, you guys.  Oh, my God!  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, dear Lord.  Still one of my favorites right there.  Oh, dear Lord.  Yeah.  Kelsey taking a spill.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, ladies and gentlemen.  I hope at this point you know what wow is about. 
[00:06:00]  If you don't, very simple concept.  Here we go again.  Explaining wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  How many times?  How many times?  Let me plaster a smile on this face and run through this shit one more time for everybody.  Thank you, Bill Hicks.  Thank you.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yeah, it's a very easy concept.  You get a wow sticker.  You can do that by going to opianthony.com.  Basically, we want you to send in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  You do that.  One of our fine go-getters will send you a sticker immediately. 
[00:06:30]  Immediately.  All right.  If you don't feel like doing that, you can make a homemade wow sign.  You can write it on the dirt in the back of your truck.  Right.  And basically what happens, ladies see these wows all over the highways, and they flash you.  Or some will.  And some will give you the finger and think you're disgusting.  But it will get a response.  It sure will, especially when you're driving to beaches in the summertime or a concert or 
[00:07:00]  like a sporting event when you're stuck in traffic.  That's a perfect time to sport your wow because the girls feel a little more festive in that  environment.  A little more free.  It's a little more easily accessible to get the breast-to-sees out.  Sure.  I've seen a lot more wow stickers out there on the road these days.  That's for sure.  It's building, isn't it?  Mm-hmm.  It's nice to see.  All the trucks.  Amazing.  All right.  See, when I drive in on the expressway, and I'll see a truck, and I'll kind of look over,  see who's driving. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Dude, I...  There he is.  I get excited.  One of ours.  I was going to say, I think I've talked about this before, but when I see a wow stick on  the highway, I'm beeping like a mad man going, that's me!  That's me.  And most of these guys look at me like I'm a raving lunatic.  Yeah.  I have no clue.  Or I'm hoping for a flash or something.  I'm like, no, dick, that's me!  That's why...  Show me your cock!  I have to get a sign for my car, because it's getting a little weird, you know, because  I do beep a lot when I see these guys, like, thanks for the support, is basically what 
[00:08:00]  I'm saying.  Yeah.  I need a sign that just says, I'm Opie or something.  Hi, Mopey!  Hi!  So they don't think I'm a freak, I just want to thank them for having a wow sticker on their  car, that's all.  I think they'd think you were a freak if you held up a sign saying who you were driving  anyway.  Yeah, true.  Very true.  All right.  Well...  Just got to kind of move on.  Here you go.  What's M.O.?  Missouri, maybe?  No, M.O.  M.O. is Montana, M.O. is...  No, M.O. is Missouri.  M.O. is Missouri.  Why is M.O. Missouri? 
[00:08:30]  Because M.S. is Mississippi.  What's M.I.?  Michigan?  I think M.I. is Michigan.  Yeah, all right.  Isn't it?  I'm laughing.  It could be Maine.  M.I.  M.N. is Minnesota.  M.A. is...  What's Maine?  Why don't we just spell out the states?  George, what's up?  What's Massachusetts?  Maine is M.A.?  M.A.  M.E. is Maine?  Yeah, and I think Minnesota is M.N.  Very good.  Montana is M.T.? 
[00:09:00]  Why M.T.?  Montana?  Oh, I thought that was mountain time.  It could be, but...  It's just Montana, M.T.  All right.  Well, George, what's going on?  You're all the M states there?  All right, wait a minute.  Hold on.  Where is this tsunami warning?  Oh, it was California.  Those fucking assholes.  No one even knew what tsunami was until a few months back, and now that's the hot word  to use on the news.  Tsunami.  That's the fear word for this month.  Tsunami warning. 
[00:09:30]  What happened?  There was an earthquake in California?  Earthquake, California.  So they had some kind of a tsunami warning, but one never developed.  They've been having earthquakes in California since, I believe, the beginning of time!  And you never hear of tsunami warnings, and I don't think there's ever been a tsunami  that they've had to worry about.  That whole thing over there in Thailand, that was one of those very rare occasions.  One of those perfect storm type things.  It was so huge, the earthquake, bigger than they even thought, and it opened up such a 
[00:10:00]  friggin' gap in the ocean floor that made a big wave like that.  It doesn't happen that often.  So you don't get the opportunity to write really clever song parodies about it very often.  Tsunami.  Jesus.  So they had this earthquake in California, and now they're telling everyone there's  a tsunami warning, but now that has passed?  Yeah, that passed.  So they scared the shit out of millions of people in California with their new fear word,  tsunami.  Tsunami.  And now it turns out there's, ah, there's no wave coming. 
[00:10:30]  Nothing to worry about here.  Move along.  Good surf.  Don't worry about it.  So California will not become Arizona Bay.  Mm-hmm.  No.  Thank you, Bill Hicks, once again.  And I don't know why I'm on a Bill Hicks kick this morning.  I don't like when the news replays stories from earlier, sometimes from years ago, and  puts the graphic up there like it's happening now.  Mm-hmm.  Like they just showed tsunami warning.  They were showing a broadcast from yesterday and showing how there was a tsunami warning. 
[00:11:00]  And then you look, without the sound on, here in the studio, we look up sometimes and get  all freaked out.  See?  That something's happening.  You wrecked my bit because I was going to abuse you and go, well, Anthony, most people  watch TV with the sound up.  I know.  We have to do a radio show and take a peek and assume that what we're seeing on TV is  happening.  Yeah.  What was the one the other day?  That was the yesterday.  It said Learjet.  No, private jet.  That was a Monday.  Yeah.  Private jet with no one on controls, like no pilot. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Controlling plane flying over Nebraska or something.  So we were ready to break into our radio program.  What is this?  It's just a 10-year anniversary of the Payne Stewart thing.  Payne Stewart.  Yeah, that plane.  It was 10 years ago?  I think so, yeah.  I think.  Right?  10?  Why else would they have done it?  Yeah.  You don't show that on, like, five-year anniversary.  Not really.  That's a real 10-year.  You've got to acknowledge it.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Let's go back to Missouri.  With that story quickly, I watched it inside with the sound on. 
[00:12:00]  It was pretty interesting.  And they had an interview with the F-16 fighter pilot that went up next to the plane to see  what was going on.  He pulled up as close as he can get.  And they played his radio transmission back.  And it was, wow.  How the cockpit and all the windows are just frosted over with ice.  Like, you couldn't even see in the cockpit.  So when that's happening, you could rest assured there's nobody alive in that plane.  Couldn't even see.  Like, it would have been really creepy to just see the dead pilot and co-pilot in there. 
[00:12:30]  With icicles on his nose and stuff.  Yeah, all frozen.  Like movie frozen.  Yeah, all white.  Why do you have to have an icicle on someone's nose in the movies to say, hey, that guy's  frozen.  They all look like Nicholson at the end of the shining sitting there.  Well, either they're all dead on that plane or they're having daiquiris.  Yeah, pretty creepy story.  What happened?  The cabin person just dropped or left the plane? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, it left slow, though.  Yeah, if it was one of those rapid decompressions, then they would have known what was going on.  They could have thrown on their oxygen and gone to a lower altitude.  But it happened so slow that they just slowly passed out.  You just kind of get into a, whoa, you run out of air.  You get euphoric, and then you just kind of pass out, and it's over, Johnny.  So they didn't know to put their masks on?  No.  They must have reached a point where they felt a little disorientation and then not knowing 
[00:13:30]  what's going on.  And quickly, they just went into some kind of euphoric state where you're just like on  laughing gas, on nitrous.  Are you describing this show every day?  Yeah, that's this show.  And then you pass out.  I'm like, are you describing the Payne Stewart?  Or what happens on this program every day?  Yeah, you'll feel a little disoriented and slightly euphoric, and you'll pass out. 
[00:14:00]  And then listen to the replay.  Anthony, I think it was 1999.  It was 1999?  The Payne Stewart thing.  So that was like six years ago.  What were they showing it for?  I don't know.  What could they possibly be doing a six-year, stupid-ass assuming that it would be a 10-year  thing?  It's October 29th, 1999.  Right.  Why were they playing that?  Now I got to know.  Uh, I don't know.  It was like a, I don't know, like a five-and-a-half-year look back?  It could not have been a look back. 
[00:14:30]  When I watched it inside, they were doing interviews with other people, so perhaps they just decided  to revisit it and get interviews with people that were involved, looking back on it.  Yeah.  I don't know, because you sure can't figure out an anniversary for that.  Were they that or they're doing a video of the funniest moments in golf?  Look at this one.  That's horrible.  Trying to think if there's any other funny golf moments.  They got me thinking.  Anytime anyone gets hit in the nuts. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  The Michael Douglas story.  Remember that one?  He got in trouble and had to pay off a bunch of money a few years back?  Well, he teed off, and his ball goes flying.  Apparently, he's a pretty good golfer, Michael Douglas.  And he hit a caddy square in the sack, right in the sack, to the point where this guy had  so much damage that later on they had to remove one of his testicles.  He hit him.  And Michael Douglas, there were other people around him, and the word got out that he said 
[00:15:30]  this, and he wound up having to pay this guy a settlement, and it was a big hoopla,  and they really put the kibosh on the story quickly.  He must have some good people.  He started laughing and said, oh, okay, we'll get to that later.  He started laughing, and people around him heard him say, ha, ha, I hit the nigger in  the balls.  Michael Douglas.  Is that an exact quote from him?  That's an exact quote, and he was laughing at it, because obviously he hit some black 
[00:16:00]  gentleman, a caddy, and boy, there was an outrage and an uproar, and he wound up paying  out some money for that.  Oh, so you think he was more like, he probably wouldn't have been able to assume if he hadn't  said that, but he probably didn't want that release.  He didn't want that release, so he, you know, squashed it quickly.  Him, his people, a little bit of money you throw at the problem, and it goes away.  But, wow.  If that is an hysterical golf moment.  A caddy.  A caddy.  A caddy.  All right.  Why don't we go back to Missouri? 
[00:16:30]  I think that's where we started here.  George in Missouri.  What's up?  Hey.  Good morning, ONA.  Good morning, George.  Hello, Jimmy.  How you doing, man?  Fine, George.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Hey, well, I picked up some stickers when I saw you in Houston at the Houston Improv.  Okay.  And I put them on my truck.  I'm a truck driver.  And yesterday, I got wowed for the first time.  See, it works.  Yeah, yeah, it worked.  I was driving down the road.  Well, I just wanted to warn the other truckers, man. 
[00:17:00]  You got to be careful, because I was driving down the road, and this girl pulls up next  to me, and she's playing with her titties and shit.  She's playing with her nipples.  And, you know, I didn't know whether to look at the road or her titties.  So I decided to look at her titties, and I almost ran her off the road.  Dan, we want you to be careful out there.  Yes, very careful.  Don't kill the girl, wowing.  Apparently, it's the first U.S. Open at the same course.  Payne Stewart won the U.S. Open at six years ago. 
[00:17:30]  And then Digger Dog from Whack Bag has another funny golf moment.  When that Kennedy kid smashed that chick's skull in with a golf club.  Yeah, sicko.  The Moxley Open.  The Moxley Open.  Derek had one, too, from the booth there.  Derek, you want to say your own joke there?  Oh, he's eating.  That's it.  Put the sign where we can't see the bottom line. 
[00:18:00]  When he's done chewing.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to EJ and NJ.  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  Yeah, I went through that rapid decompression thing for training for the Air Force.  Yeah?  It's the creepiest thing.  You never know that you're losing all your oxygen until you put your oxygen mask back on.  Because you start blacking out.  You start laughing.  Everything's funny.  And, like, they get you all this work.  They're, like, trying writing your name.  Try doing simple addition.  You can't do shit.  But all of a sudden, they're, like, put your oxygen back on.  And you look at what you read and everything.  And all of a sudden, color comes back. 
[00:18:30]  It's like that you don't know what's going on at all.  Yeah, it screws your mind up so bad that those pilots must have just been sitting there and chuckling to each other as they're, you know, getting that tunnel vision as the darkness creeps in from your peripheral.  And then you're gone.  And you get to see nothing at all.  So, finally, they, like, put it back on.  They give you, you know, they yell your name.  Like, hey, put it back on.  You're starting to freak out.  They'll freak out?  No, I'm not.  And in your mind, you're thinking, no, I'm not.  What?  And you can never tell what's going on.  You're like, oh, my God, I didn't realize.  And so I put the oxygen back on. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  You hope that the pilots didn't pass out first.  And then there was, like, maybe a pain through one of his friends, like, put the mask on and they realize what's, oh, this is.  Oh, God, now what do you do?  Everything's frozen in here.  It's got a little chilly.  Oh, you come with that dopey oxygen mask on freezing your balls off.  It was rapid decompression.  They would have known because they gave us that, too.  And that's like a, it's like getting punched in the face.  It's like this wind smacks in the face and blows out your ears.  And all of a sudden, you're like, oh, shit.  It's a big boom.  The alarms are going off.  Forget about it.  Yeah, they would know. 
[00:19:30]  The pilots would know that.  But, yeah, the slow one is the one that will get you.  All right, E.J.  I've got nothing else, guys.  All right, peace.  Do they have monitors for that on a plane?  Yeah, you would think they would.  But I guess that whenever it started happening and the alarms went off, I guess they thought, you know, ooh, party favors.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  You know, a little late.  I'm sure they have alarms now on those private jets.  James in Illinois, what's up?  Oh, I just wanted to say hello, Mr. Norton, and congratulations.  Can I call you?  It's Jimmy.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Well, it's about time someone called in and congratulated Jimmy Norton. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, Jimmy, that was awesome.  You just killed.  Thank you, Mr.  You've got to be at the peak of your, you know, whatever you want to do.  That's got to be the tops.  I mean, just remember the little people when you get to Vegas after Wayne Newton, will you?  Thanks, fella.  All right, congratulations, man.  You're great.  Thanks, buddy.  All right, James.  One of the best moments on that Leno appearance was when you were talking to, what's her name there, Hillary Duff. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Real quickly, and you just went, yeah.  And then it was all uncomfortable, the way you looked at her.  Like, that was such great, a great look of being, like, all uncomfortable and nervous and turned away,  and everyone just started laughing their asses off.  Yeah.  Someone thought that I was, like, shitting on her because, like, she said something that, like, a joke that didn't make it,  but I didn't even hear what she said.  She said something.  She was just chatting, and I was just being creepy.  Yeah, you were being all creepy.  It was great.  It was awesome. 
[00:21:00]  It was perfect.  She was a very good sport about it.  Absolutely perfect, and now you're back here.  That's where I want to be.  The XM studio with your pals, Opie and Anthony.  It's just like being on Jay Leto.  Yeah.  Did we tell you about our Bravo appearance?  Oh, look at that.  We talked about superheroes and villains.  Oh, I watched some of those clips last night online.  Oh, what a waste of time. 
[00:21:30]  My God.  Do you remember when we filmed that, Jim?  I do.  Yeah.  The icy cockpit of Payne Stewart's plane had more energy.  We went over this.  Than we had.  I'm like, yeah, well, whatever.  We went over it yesterday, finally, Jimmy.  Like, it aired a couple Sundays ago, I guess, or over Memorial Day weekend.  And that following Tuesday, or whenever we got back on the air, the phones went crazy.  The email went crazy.  Instant feedback crazy.  Are you guys going to talk about your Bravo appearance? 
[00:22:00]  And Anthony and I just made believe we didn't see anybody running in.  And we decided that we had way too much to get to to actually talk about our Bravo appearance.  But finally, yesterday, we got to it.  We taped for two and a half hours easily.  Easily.  Maybe even longer, Ant.  I mean, it was all afternoon.  And I counted up our air time yesterday.  It was about a minute and a half.  Yeah.  And it was an awful minute and a half.  No, it wasn't awful.  It was, how we described it yesterday, a who cares appearance. 
[00:22:30]  Who cares?  It was an awful, it wasn't good, it was just there.  Sam Smith from Jersey.  What about Fuzzy Zeller and his fried chicken and watermelon comments to Tiger Woods?  Oh, yeah.  Another hysterical golf moment.  What about Derrick's?  You don't like Derrick's?  What?  I didn't see the sign.  Go ahead, Derrick.  It was John Daly.  Oh, right.  Shaking from alcohol withdrawal.  Right.  There you go.  An alcoholic trying to shake it off and play golf. 
[00:23:00]  Yep.  That'll affect your swing.  All right.  Let's go to Gabe in Jersey.  Gabe.  Yeah, hey, dudes.  Hey.  I want to say that I saw the Bravo appearance.  It's pretty cool because knowing, you know, being a fan of the show for all these years,  Anthony actually adds legitimacy to the whole thing because he's such a super geek, you know?  Yeah.  But, uh, Poby is just eye candy.  Sitting there with a little blonde line.  Eye candy.  Yeah, I like traveling around with a little eye candy. 
[00:23:30]  I'll be completely honest.  I had no business doing that appearance.  They should have just had Anthony by himself.  I was goofing on the guy that was interviewing us, goofing on the camera guys.  I was just making a mockery of the whole thing and adding stuff when I could, but I was out  of my league.  I don't know much about that stuff.  It would be the same thing as if ESPN wanted us to comment on basketball.  Oh, yeah.  I'd be all over that.  And I'd be sitting there, I don't know anything about basketball, you know, and I hope he  knows a lot about it.  Wait, were you guys watching, it was like watching, you were commenting on footage, right? 
[00:24:00]  It was the, it was what, no, it was, it was what every damn show is now doing.  The panels thing, you get, uh, you get a C-list.  They tell you, what do you think about Darth Vader?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go.  To talk about shit.  Darth Vader, villain, go.  Did you have it in advance, the information?  No.  No, but we.  That's the difference.  I would never do that without information.  No.  Never.  Is that what we do now, Jimmy?  Always.  See, Jimmy knows, he's been on Leno.  Oh, yeah, well, you know, it's funny.  Jimmy's going to hold our hand through all our TV appearances. 
[00:24:30]  Through the next stage of our careers as well.  Dude, I've done those before, those are not as easy, they look easy, but you realize there's  500 comments you make, 10 are good, that's the way it is, they edit everybody.  Yeah.  Always get them in advance, even the videos, I won't do it without, they wanted me, Nick  DiPaolo has a show on VH1, you know, and I love Nick, but they wanted me to do the show  one time, it was like a last minute thing someone canceled, I'm like, well, can I get the  videos?  He's like, we won't have time.  I'm like, I'll have to do it next time.  Because it won't come out right, you've got to at least have one time to look through  it, get your thoughts, all the unfunny ideas, you know, that would have sucked, why would  I have said that?  Get that sorted out before you go on there. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, dude, you always get this stuff first.  Yeah.  All right.  See, live and learn, Opie.  There you go.  Gabe, did you have another comment?  Yeah, I've got a couple other funny golf moments.  All right.  One, when George Bush, the president, nailed someone right off the tee.  Was that Ford or was it Bush?  No, I think it was Bush.  Okay.  And then when John Daly turned around on the tee box and golfed and drove right over  the crowd's head.  He did that once?  Like a psycho.  Yeah, he's great.  I love watching him.  He didn't hit anyone, but I mean, think about it. 
[00:25:30]  At the time, he was like the biggest golfer and, you know, he's known for how far he hits  the ball and he just turned around and wailed one over the crowd.  I love watching that guy.  And got immediately ejected.  Yeah, cool.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Virginia Beach and say hi to Mark.  Mark.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Welcome to the Opiate Anthony Program.  It's just peachy to be here.  Hey, I caught the virus on premium and now I'm contagious as hell.  Thanks, Mark.  Trying to share it down here in Virginia Beach.  Jimmy, you were awesome on TV the other night, man. 
[00:26:00]  Thank you, sir.  Fantastic job.  Thanks, bud.  The boss is coming down here to a new comedy club down at the beach and kind of hoping  you'd get an appearance down here as well.  Just opened up.  I'm doing the State Theater in Falls Church, Virginia, the 25th, I think, or 26th.  Okay, up in northern Virginia, D.C. area.  Oh, you're farther south?  Yeah, down at Virginia Beach.  Okay.  Look at people requesting Jimmy to come to their town now.  Well, that's what's going to happen.  Like a traveling minstrel show.  Jimmy's blowing up right in front of our eyes. 
[00:26:30]  We got a little shoe polish on the old face.  There you go.  Mammy, how I love you.  How I love you.  How was the flight home, Jimmy?  It was actually good.  Uneventful.  That's how you want it.  Yeah.  Nice, boring flight.  No frozen flight deck.  Yeah, no giggling.  No giggling in the cockpit before you get a little chill.  Can I have a blanket, please?  Oh, burr.  A blanket.  You need an ice scraper to look out the window.  Oh, what's happening up there? 
[00:27:00]  Flying out there.  I was talking to the guys in the dress, in the green, the office.  Listen to him.  He's all Jay Leno'd out.  He doesn't know.  Oh, the dressing.  The green room.  Green room.  The friggin' office.  When I was having my makeup out, looking at Ben's cock.  Yeah, it's just like, like I said, we should do a comparison today.  Our show compared to Jay Leno.  Yeah.  At Leno, you get a nice green room.  They probably bring you in like a gift basket of something.  The host actually talks to you before the show. 
[00:27:30]  Well, I actually got, they gave you these weird stadium seat warmers from The Tonight Show  with a little heating pad, like the little seat warmers.  Really?  It's like just to bring beer or whatever.  Nice.  Yeah.  And it was good.  What was I going to say?  Well, I was just comparing the two.  It's pretty funny if you think about it.  Because like you walked in today and everyone congratulated you.  And then you sat at your desk and went through your Buttman collection of magazines.  That's just like it being on The Leno Show.  Oh, just like it.  I think you were going to talk about the flight out to L.A. 
[00:28:00]  I felt like such a hack even in life even talking about this.  But there was a fat lady next to me.  I honestly thought I was going to have an air rage incident, like beyond being funny.  This fat, I hate fucking fat people.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Dude, I swear to God.  It was beyond like comedically joking.  I had the emergency row.  Like when you walk into a plane, you have all that space by that one first seat there in coach.  Right.  I was in coach both ways. 
[00:28:30]  Ouch.  Yeah, it's, you know, it's fine.  That'll hurt.  Yeah.  It's, you know, I didn't mind mingling with the folks getting to know people.  What is it you guys do?  You know, I had no idea what they did in the second part of the plane.  The rowers.  Yeah.  And this, I had all this leg room and this fat lady who was like an unapologetically fat lady.  Like just.  Yeah.  Hey, if you're fat and you're on a plane, you better be one cordial fat person.  You better be very accommodating to everyone.  And realize, you know what they have to do? 
[00:29:00]  They have to realize that you are an inconvenience to people.  Yes.  And you must go out of your way now to make that, to minimize that inconvenience.  Really fast, I was flying to Orlando recently for my nephew's high school graduation.  And I was one of the, I'm the guy that has to be on the plane just about last.  I don't want to sit on a plane for 20, 30 minutes because you're going to fly for a while and sit anyway.  So I wait to where they're looking around like anyone else.  And then I finally go.  So I get on the plane pretty late.  And I get, I'm walking down the aisle in front of another person that was, you know, last minute traveler. 
[00:29:30]  Really fat lady.  Okay.  Oh boy.  And I swear to you, because I'm behind her, I'm watching everyone's face as she's walking down the aisle going, oh, and there are empty seats because it's not a full flight.  Yeah, don't sit next to me.  That's the key to the story because usually if there's not many, if there's only one empty seat and a fat lady's coming, you know you're screwed.  Yeah.  But in this case, there were enough empty seats where people, you could see in their eyes going, oh my God, please not me, not me. 
[00:30:00]  Because it's like a three-hour flight to Orlando.  And sure enough, she got the middle seat.  And these two guys were so openly bummed on either side of her.  Because it wasn't that she was just fat and she was going to be snug.  She could barely fit in her seat.  And I'm telling you, there was like fat spilling over.  Because, yeah, they sit down, they squeeze in there, but then the rest of it is hanging over their shoulders or in your, you know, it's in your seat.  It's in your seat.  The lunch lady arms just flapping. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, flapping.  But if you, God forbid, now you've got to get out and take a leak and crawl over it.  But the looks from these people going, oh my God, is it going to be me?  You just saw it in their eyes.  And they were all just, and finally she sat down and wrecked this, these two people's, their trip to Orlando.  The whole flight.  I laughed going to Orlando.  This was Los Angeles.  I know.  Oh my God.  Going to Orlando and back.  Yeah.  And it was, sometimes you feel bad for someone.  Like, look, I know this is your own food addiction, but you do feel bad.  Like, I know this has got to be embarrassing for you to have to, because you know you're inconveniencing people. 
[00:31:00]  That's why they should just minimize the inconvenience by being nice and giving.  Absolutely.  Giving.  They should just wear a little sign on the front that says, little little shirt.  You should just say, oink, oink.  And on the back, it should say, I'm sorry.  Hey, get your oink, oink, I'm sorry t-shirts.  That's right.  Going to be handing those out.  Your official Opie and Anthony t-shirts.  You know I've had a bad ankle for a while.  I think I have a sprained ankle.  I think that's a problem.  And she banged her knapsack.  She had a knapsack, a pillow, like a big, like a red and orange pillow, and a little, 
[00:31:30]  like a shopping bag, like a plastic shopping bag with food and matzah and cheese and crackers.  And she was so fat, she couldn't sit into a seat.  She had to line up her fat pig back and then kind of collapse back into the seat.  Fall into it.  The person that can't sit there, they have to collapse into it.  Yeah, and then everything could get pushed into the seat.  So like dock with the seat.  Yeah.  Line it up and then just go.  We have contact.  We have docked. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, that's great.  That's right.  You fat cosmonaut.  Spaceship, that's classic.  And she was sitting there, and I was getting to the point where I started to mumble things.  Like I had my headphones on, and I actually started going, you fat fuck.  Oh, no.  You fat pig.  Because she fell asleep three minutes.  Of course, the fat slobs always fall right asleep in her open mouth.  I actually, I was elbowing her.  Wow.  Like, I was aggressively getting physical with her, and I really thought I was going to have an air rage in.  So there was one point where I wanted to just lean over and bite her.  She was like, her fat arm was in my place, and the rage. 
[00:32:30]  And I was sinking your teeth into it and just, grr.  You fucking slob.  The nerve of you to treat yourself like that and then inconvenience.  I mean, did somebody fat call up and explain to me what goes through your head?  Because I felt bad being such a scumbag.  Like, I know that you're human beings, and it's got to be embarrassing.  You know you're inconveniencing people.  How about a John Candy-like smile and a, hi, how are you?  And almost the face that looks like, I'm sorry I'm like this. 
[00:33:00]  I'm sorry I'm inconveniencing you.  It can be done with a look.  It really can.  Where they look over and go, hi, yeah, I'm sitting here.  Yeah.  And you know they're saying, look, I'm fat.  I'm ruining your flight.  I have to get from point A to point B.  And I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  A bus was out of the question.  Trust me, my life is miserable.  I know it.  Yeah, believe me, after you get off this plane.  I'm sorry my miserable life is going to inconvenience you for five hours, but I have to live like this my entire life. 
[00:33:30]  We will both leave this plane.  You will soon forget about this.  And I have to live this.  I still have to be a fat mom.  Every minute of the day.  Just ruining people as I was.  You're going to be on The Tonight Show.  Right.  I'm going to be a fat fuck.  It was her arrogance and her lack of, like, she bumped into my bad foot twice in her book bag.  She had to go in the back and put her bag in because she came on last minute.  And then she sits there and she's got the pillow bumping into me and her bag is, everything's touching me and I hate being fucking touched.  Yeah.  I really don't want it.  Yeah, I hear you.  It's like, you stay in your space, I'll stay in my space. 
[00:34:00]  But she was in my space and it made me have rage, man.  Yeah.  For real rage.  I don't have it.  I wanted to smack her in her fucking mouth.  An open-handed, like, cup smack right against her fat matzo-eating mouth.  She had a bag of matzo's.  Hey, stop eating carbohydrates, you fat fuck.  And with cheese also?  Of course.  Of course.  God forbid she yanks out an Atkins snack.  God forbid she yanks out maybe a piece of fruit.  Some fruit.  God forbid.  There's got to be cheese involved with everything.  Yeah, because that's glands.  You know, that's your glands, by the way, when you decide to eat cheese instead of a fucking apple. 
[00:34:30]  You know, I can't help myself.  Really?  You can't stop shoveling it in, you lonely fucking molestation cover-upper?  Even on the plane.  Yeah, that's why.  Even on the plane, you've got to bring our own food.  I'm with you.  I'm not buying that I can't help myself.  No.  They can't help themselves, but you see them in the supermarket going to the Entenmann's  aisle or whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Instead of the fruit and vegetable aisle.  I saw that in the drugstore, one of the Rite-Aids, the other day.  I was in there, and a couple of girls come in, and they're really heavy, big, fat asses. 
[00:35:00]  And right by the register is all that impulse buying stuff.  And they were picking up Entenmann's cakes, like this berry-filled friggin' strudel thing  and other things.  And then they're talking to each other like, oh, boy, I know what this is going to do to  me.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, put it down.  Nope.  Shoveled it right in her face before she even paid for it.  When you have to take your fat ass up to the register and hand the woman an empty piece  of cellophane with the price on it so she can go beep and scan it because you couldn't 
[00:35:30]  wait to leave the store before you eat.  You may have a problem.  There's just empty stuff.  Empty boxes and papers.  Thank you.  Yeah, no, I'm good.  What do I owe you?  Not a restaurant?  You might be a fat ass.  Well, it's just aggravating because it's like, I read an article, and some guy was saying,  well, why is it we're so comfortable attacking people's smoking addictions?  He said that we were at a table at a dinner, and they were talking about some guy who smokes 
[00:36:00]  at the table.  He wasn't smoking at the moment, but they're like, you know, you've got to quit smoking.  It's so bad for you.  And he's like, yeah, I know, I know.  And he's kind of like, got that, oh, shucks, I am a guilty smoker.  Why do you never see somebody attacking someone who's fat?  Like, or other addictions, like, look at you, why don't you stop eating?  Like, why is that an acceptable addiction to attack?  And I know food's a necessity in cigarettes, so I know all that.  But why is one acceptable and not the other?  Why are you a bad guy if you tell somebody to stop eating?  If she was eating celery, or had yanked out some, just like, you know, crackers because 
[00:36:30]  she thinks they're healthier, I was eating celery and fruit, I would have had half the  anger.  Like, at least this poor, almost genderless creature is attempting to do something for  herself.  Almost genderless, huh?  Yeah, she was almost to the point of so fat, you have to guess at what's between the legs.  At what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is that about, like, fat, that kind of, it messes up everything where you can't  quite tell, man or woman.  The fat, like anything sensual or masculine or feminine about a face just becomes cherubish 
[00:37:00]  and round and John Panettish.  Yeah, you just can't quite figure it out.  Yeah, if she would have been trying, you would have said, well, obviously there's a problem  there or something she can't control.  But when you're coming on with matzah and cheese and...  Or a little apologetic, like, hey, when you get drunk on a plane, I'm an alky, if you  get drunk on a plane and you're abusive and obnoxious to the person next to you, they're  not going to go, hey, look, this person has an addiction, I should feel some empathy.  They're going to go, you fucking drunk, shut your fucking mouth.  Shut up.  That's the way it is with this, get out of my space. 
[00:37:30]  You got to try to talk them into leaving the plane when they're drunk.  The door's right there, pally.  Yeah, just go ahead, I dare you.  Leave.  Let's go to Seattle.  Jeff?  Yo.  What's up, Jeff?  How's it going?  So it's ONA.  Angel, how you doing?  Hi, Jeff.  Nice to talk to you guys.  Hey, you know, the big problem with these airlines, man, you can have a 50-pound bag, right, and  you won't get charged a thing.  You end up with a 55-pound bag, you get some sort of extra charge.  25 bucks. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, something like 25.  Yep.  Yeah, yeah.  And so, anyway, me, I stand, I'm about a buck 60 and six foot two.  You know what I mean?  I'm not a very, I'm pretty slim.  I'll say.  I can go up with a 55-pound bag, get a $25 charge, but the lady behind me, she weighs  300 pounds and she's five foot five.  Well, it seems like, I'm sorry to interrupt you, buddy. 
[00:38:30]  I know, it seems like none of the airlines have the balls to sell, what they're supposed  to do, like, in line with what you're saying, is sell two seats to the person.  And, like, Southwest did that with those monstrosities that got on the plane.  Who cares if there's a bit about that on Yellow Discipline?  Yeah, absolutely.  But what they should do, all the airlines are too embarrassed and they're probably so  afraid of going, you have to pay for two seats and then all of a sudden being sued.  Right, they wouldn't.  And going, oh my God, you weren't fat enough to say that to?  Oh my God, that was discriminatory, the American with Disabilities Act.  Nick DiPaolo, I'll quote him, has the funniest joke about the American with Disabilities Act 
[00:39:00]  applying to fat people.  He said, if you're missing a limb, you're disabled.  If you're missing a cheesecake, you're full.  Such hatred comes out of that crooked mouth.  I love it.  God, I've had a fucking brilliant joke.  Let's go to Pete in Kansas.  Pete, what's going on today?  Hi, guys.  Hey, boy, before we get to slamming me too hard here, Jimmy, you were awesome.  Thanks.  You're going to be a huge, huge star, man. 
[00:39:30]  Thanks, mister.  Hey, I am the big fat fuck on the airplane.  You know, the first thing I do, and I'm getting serious about this, I'll look at the person  who's unfortunate enough to sit next and say, man, I am really sorry.  Just got to apologize everywhere you go.  Oh, you bet, man.  How do they usually respond to that?  Most, 99% of the time, they say, oh, man, don't worry about it, don't worry about it.  But you know, you can see it in their face like, oh, man. 
[00:40:00]  My flight is just fresh.  I'm sorry to laugh at you, man.  It's just ruined.  I love your honesty, though.  You start looking around, too, at the exit and thinking, how am I going to get over this  fat fuck?  I'm going to have to go over the seat in front of me if we need to get out of this thing.  Hey, dude, do you do this?  This is one thing that made me feel a little bit for her.  Like, I did want to kind of cut her throat.  But then I started to think, like, she brought a pillow with her, and I noticed that, because  I guess her arms, I guess someone that fat knows, if you hang your arms on the side, you're 
[00:40:30]  going to be completely, you know, in someone's lap.  So she would rapidly kind of lock her arms around the pillow.  It was almost like she brought the pillow so she could keep her arms in front of herself  and be less in someone else's seat.  Oh, really?  I cross my arms intentionally to try to keep as much space, you know, away from you as  I can.  The sweat and stench that must be under those pits being closed and arms folded for an entire  flight.  I also apply extra care in the morning before that. 
[00:41:00]  How do you eat?  Do you eat on a tray?  Because she couldn't take her food thing down because there was no seat in front of us.  So hers is like one of those arm ones that opens up and pulls in front of you.  Oh, that ain't going to happen.  She ain't going to be able to pull that in front of her.  Well, I'm not.  Let me, Travis, because I played football for 14 years.  So, I mean, I'm big anyway.  So, I mean, I just gained a lot of weight because I kept eating after I played ball.  And so I'm not flowing over like some of these people are. 
[00:41:30]  Flowing over.  Hey, Pete, how much do you weigh just so we got the visual here?  I'm 325.  All right.  That's big.  Yeah, I'm 6'325".  You know, you can't go to, like, sporting events or concerts, right?  Because, I mean, those seats are even smaller.  No, I go to hockey games.  Yeah.  All around the avalanche games.  Yeah.  I don't have a lot of fun out there.  But then again, those seats, you aren't sitting in your seat.  No?  How do you get into the hockey games? 
[00:42:00]  You just tell them you're the Zamboni?  I am the Zamboni.  All right.  Hey.  Pete, thanks for your honesty today, all right?  Hey, anything for the show.  All right.  There he goes.  Pete in Kansas.  And that would have taken some of the anger away that, like, hey, sorry.  If you're inconveniencing somebody and you do that, it's kind of hard to be mad at somebody  that you know is uncomfortable.  Patrice once told me, you learn when you're that big.  Because he's a tall guy, too.  He's like, you learn how to be uncomfortable.  Even in my car, like, because he's 6'3", or whatever, he's like, you just learn how to  live uncomfortably. 
[00:42:30]  So, like, you kind of feel bad, too.  It's the big guy, like Patrice, is the guy that sits in front of me in the movies, so.  Yeah.  In the movie theater.  It's like, if you're a tall person in the movie theater, how could you just plunk down  in front of someone that's already sitting down without thinking about it?  Like, can't you get the...  If you're a big guy and you're going to the movies, I think in order to be, not inconvenience  people, you should get there early, find a seat, and sit in it.  And that way, whoever sits behind you, it's their friggin' problem, you know? 
[00:43:00]  You just go in, and then you can look and go, well, I'm not sitting there.  But they just plop down in front of you, and it's like, well, there we go.  I just paid nine bucks to look at the back of this mutant's head.  I'm average size, maybe just under six, maybe five, whatever.  And when I go to the movie theater, I always make sure I don't sit in front of anyone.  No.  Don't sit in front of anybody.  And I scrunch down.  And I scrunch down to begin with.  But I still will make sure there's no one behind me.  Yeah.  You get people that just plop down in front of you, like, okay, great. 
[00:43:30]  Now I've got to move.  Because it's all about them.  There's so many people in this world, they just think it's all about them.  All about them.  No one else is living on the same...  It's the guy in the left lane of the Long Island Expressway.  Left lane.  There isn't a car in front of him.  For, like, a mile.  There's no one in front of him.  There's pretty heavy traffic.  He's doing the exact same speed as the guy in the middle lane, who's doing the same speed as the guy in the right lane, making a virtual blockade.  Now, there's no one in front of him.  Does he look in the rearview mirror and think, wow, there's about a hundred cars in a parade behind me. 
[00:44:00]  I'm in the left lane, and there's absolutely no one in front of me.  Perhaps I am the cork here.  I'm the guy stopping things up.  Maybe if I move out of the way, this parade will be able to go forward.  They don't even think like that.  They never look in the mirror.  Yeah.  They just don't think like that.  Some centered asses.  And me, meanwhile, I'm constantly, man, my eyes are scanning the mirrors. 
[00:44:30]  I'm looking.  And I go a pretty good clip in the left lane.  If I see somebody coming up on my ass, they don't even have to slow down.  Nope.  I'm over.  They pass.  And then I'm back in on my way.  It's the game you play.  You know, I go easily 80 in the left-hand lane.  But if someone's going 85 behind me, hey, you win.  Go ahead.  I'm out of your way, buddy.  No problem.  I'm not going to be sitting there like, no, you shouldn't be going more than 80.  It's the asshole also that's doing like maybe 75.  So he's going faster than the speed limit.  Right.  And then you go around him to pass him in the middle lane. 
[00:45:00]  Because I want to do 80.  Right.  And he starts speeding up.  Like, oh, you're not getting in front.  Why?  I'll be, believe me, you'll see my taillights for a couple of seconds.  But they don't want to, they don't want you to pass him.  Because I got to be first.  Oh, no.  I had a thought.  Oh, it was a good one, too.  Not a funny one, just a good one.  Just hope there's one of those wooden crosses and flowers with his name on it around a pole.  Up the road somewhere.  Can we stop with the roadside memorials?  The depressing friggin' roadside memorials? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, highways are...  Do we need to be reminded of our mortality as we're driving down the road by seeing some impromptu grave on the side of the road?  Highways are depressing to begin with.  Oh, my God.  Unless you're driving from, I don't know, like L.A. to San Francisco.  You know, beautiful coastline drive or something.  That's what I want.  It's pretty depressing to begin with.  And you've got to see that.  I want to cross the size that Christ dragged through the street on the side of a pole with stuffed animals so I know children were involved.  Little flowers.  Like, hey, you start looking. 
[00:46:00]  You could build the whole story in your head of what happened.  All right, it was a minivan, six children on board.  Right.  All dead.  God, that is funny.  I don't want to see them.  Well, it used to be that it was just every once in a while you see one.  It's like, oh, that was kind of a nice gesture.  Then, eh, you don't think about it.  But you're so right.  It's every highway.  It's almost every mile.  It's not a friggin' Learjet that plowed into the ground they couldn't find a body for, that you need a rock there with their names on it.  I'm sure you had an accident.  There's a grave somewhere.  Put flowers there.  Leave our highways alone. 
[00:46:30]  And who's stopping in the shoulder and opening the trunk and taking a stuffed animal out and putting it on the shoulder?  Putting it there, putting the cross up, it's always right next to that tree with the big gouge taken out of it.  Enough.  Right.  Enough.  If I see a tree with a big bite taken out of it, I'll assume it wasn't a brontosaurus.  I'll assume a car smashed into it and there may have been a few bathers were injured.  But there may have been some injuries involved.  See, I'll actually get out and take some of those stuffed animals and then just give them to my nephew. 
[00:47:00]  Happy birthday, Nick.  Happy birthday, little guy.  Why is it wet?  Was someone crying on it?  I don't know.  Horrible.  Enough.  Stop with the roadside graves.  Let's see.  Let's go to Robert in Wisconsin.  Robert, what's going on today?  Nothing.  I was on a flight from Dallas to Mobile, Alabama on one of those little planes that holds 20 people.  And that's when I figured I had to lose some weight because the guy I was sitting next to, he was a little bitty fella, and I was 5'11", 320 pounds. 
[00:47:30]  And he basically cussed me like a dog every time my arm crossed the center of the little armrest there.  Yeah.  And, yeah, it was...  What would he say to you?  Oh, oh, he just, you know, just, you know, stuff like, oh, you fat ass.  And, I mean, he was being really, he was half drunk.  And he was just being brutal, just embarrassing the shit out of me. 
[00:48:00]  And that's, you know, when I decided it was time to lose weight.  Yeah, well, you were in his territory, man.  Once you cross over that armrest, that's it.  Now you're in his zone.  I paid for the seat.  I don't want your big, fat elbow in it.  And I look at the flight attendant, by the way, not to interrupt you, I look at the flight attendant,  because the lady was sleeping at one point, and her fat, awful meat face is right by...  It was like a meatloaf with an open mouth on it, just right in my head.  And she's leaning over, and I look at the flight attendant, and instead of... 
[00:48:30]  The flight attendant, like, looks at me like, yeah.  Yeah, it's like, well, what's funny about this, bitch?  Am I getting money back?  I mean, I know, on Continental, I don't know how American Airlines is.  The seats are very small in college.  And this is where the airlines are such scumbags.  Yeah.  It's like, do you need to squeeze us for every fucking dollar?  Yeah, take a couple of seats out and spread this shit out.  Oh, mighty, do you have to?  As a corporation, can you for once think about doing the right thing?  Put some on the roof of the plane and strap some more seats up there.  Yeah, maybe put some seats in the cargo thing for the fat people, 
[00:49:00]  and a little bit of hay, they can eat all they want.  A couple of Africans shoved into the landing gear.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, we'll take one more call.  Whatever it takes.  Let's go to Charlie.  Hey, Charlie.  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey, Chuck.  Hey, Jimmy.  Good job the other night.  Thanks, bud.  Yeah, I'm one of those big fat fucks that you guys are talking about.  I purposely don't go on any flights at all now.  I mean, there's places I'd like to go.  And right now, because of my size, I can't even think about getting on a plane. 
[00:49:30]  How big are you?  I'm big.  I'm about six foot and weigh a lot more than the other six footer you had.  How much do you weigh?  How much do you weigh?  We don't know.  I'm about five.  All right.  So you watch the Discovery Channel.  Yeah.  Why don't you do something?  Get stomach stabling, man.  Well, actually, I'm working on something right now.  And, you know, to the point that you were making earlier, I think, Jim, you said it,  that these people that say they can't control themselves, that's a lot of bullshit.  I mean, people can control themselves as far as eating when they want to and when they feel they need to do it. 
[00:50:00]  And anybody that says they can't do it or they can't help themselves, they're just full of shit.  They're full of themselves and they're full of everybody else around them.  So, you know, I thought about the stomach stapling or, you know, one of those types of surgeries.  And there's just too much about it that scares me, that I don't want to try.  I know people who've done it.  And I'd rather just try to do it on my own, do it the right way.  Because the bottom line is, you know, even if I get stomach stapling, it's not going to change. 
[00:50:30]  It's going to drastically change the way I have to eat.  But it's not going to really teach me anything.  I need to do it the right way.  The only thing I can say is it might teach you something because actions are what counts.  So if all of a sudden you're forced to eat a certain way, I mean, I don't know.  I've never been, like, obese.  I mean, but I should be the way I eat and the type of addictive personality.  So I certainly have empathy for people who, like, are huge.  We're not talking about chubby or slightly overweight here either.  This is like just obese.  Yeah.  It's hard to do.  You've got to do something about it. 
[00:51:00]  Because you always think, like, you're not going to see results for a while.  So you're like, ah, you know, who cares?  It's just, it's like this thing that just is, ah, fuck it, it'll never work for me.  Dude, if you're 500 pounds, you should definitely do something.  We've got an expert right here in the studio.  That's right.  Martini Steve.  That's right.  We need an expert on somebody who's fucking almost six foot.  Martini Steve.  Yeah.  Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  Martini Steve had his stomach stapled.  I look at some old pictures sometimes.  A little chewing tobacco pouch stomach. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  On foundrymusic.com.  And I cannot remember you being that big when I see some of these old pictures.  I carry an old ID with me all the time so I can look at it and remember what a fat mess I used to be.  Yeah, Steve had his stomach stapled.  How much have you lost?  Total was 135 pounds, I think.  Wow.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  Because he's still a big guy.  Yeah, I mean, I still weigh 270 pounds right now.  You weigh 400?  Yeah, easily 400.  But I was working out all the time, so I just, I worked out. 
[00:52:00]  I just ate like a frigging maniac.  I ate too much.  And there was a time that Anthony and I counted on Steve to protect us.  Yeah.  And then he got his stomach stapled and it was great for him, but he was shrinking by the day.  And we're like, and we were feeling more and more insecure by the day.  He doesn't get too small.  No, he's still a big guy.  You wouldn't screw with Steve.  I still wouldn't mess with him, but I mean, there was, obviously I wouldn't mess with him,  but I mean, there was, there was a presence about him when he was 400 pounds is what I'm saying.  You know what I mean?  Like, who the fuck would ever take a shot at this guy? 
[00:52:30]  And then you start shrinking.  I'm like, you shrivel up.  Maybe we should call that Club Soda Kenny guy.  You just, you can't move when you're that big.  You can't really, you can't move fast.  You're always sweating.  It, you know, not to mention the stigma.  I mean, you know, when you're fat, like Jimmy was saying about Patrice,  you just learn to be uncomfortable all the time.  You learn to be, you know, to feel like everybody's looking at you as the fat, out-of-control mess in the room.  Yeah.  And that, you know, even if that's not what they're thinking, that's what you're thinking. 
[00:53:00]  You know, in the back of your mind is, I'm the fat guy in the room.  I'm the fat, out-of-control mess who can't control the rate at which the spoon hits his mouth.  And, excuse me.  You all right?  What?  You all right?  I'm lovely.  All right.  Thank you.  Sorry.  But, you know, but the stomach stapling is one option.  But it's, you should have your kitchen stapled. 
[00:53:30]  But you still have the addiction to eat, right?  Yeah.  Well, I was going to say it kills the capacity to overeat.  It doesn't kill the addiction.  You know, so you risk, you risk jumping addictions.  You know, so you might pick up booze or you might pick up...  Ah, you might.  Hence, martinis.  You're right.  You okay?  Something went down on my plate.  Sure.  I'm what I'm lovely.  Thank you, Jimmy.  So you...  Ramon, bring me a lozenge.  You went with the lozenge, right? 
[00:54:00]  Very tough word to say, Jimmy.  Not many people can get that word right.  But the level of what they call recidivism, which is people gaining all the weight back...  Of what?  Of what?  Recidivism.  Oh, good.  Because a lot of people would have said recidivism.  Oh.  Is it really recidivism?  No, not at all.  When you're a re-offender, you mean?  Oh.  Recidivism.  I'm almost positive.  Am I correct, Anthony?  I don't know.  I'm giving that one up.  Hey, man.  I've been mispronouncing that for four years now.  Recidivism, yeah.  It went over everyone's head out there. 
[00:54:30]  It's not recidivism.  Maybe 4% of the audience went, oh, that ass just mispronounced that word.  Well, can somebody look it up recidivism?  I'm almost positive because they say childless just have a high recidivism rate.  I could be incorrect.  I probably don't.  Recidivism.  Yeah, it is correct.  Is it right?  It's recidivism.  Yeah, of course.  So you've been saying that wrong.  Ramon, bring me a dictionary.  I made up your own word there.  That's all right.  Who cares?  You take a V, you put a C. 
[00:55:00]  Why not?  Recidivism.  Ain't that right, Steve V?  That's right.  Steve just wanted to feel smart.  I know.  I really did.  I really did.  It's such big words for everyone.  Recidivism.  That means I become a citizen over and over again.  Shit.  High incidence of racism.  Oh.  Such an asshole.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  Hard on.  No.  But, yeah, it kills the capacity.  It just doesn't kill the addiction.  So you wind up jumping around to different things.  Stop.  Okay.  Stop. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  I got it.  Well, are you going to do anything?  Like, did you try any type of thing to figure out what it was?  Because, you know, overeating is like drinking or whatever it is.  There's a reason for it.  But what's happening with little Steve in there?  What?  What's happening?  The same reason, like a lot of people overeat.  It's probably brought on by the fact that you want to make yourself huge to keep everybody away from you.  Wow.  That is a fat Steve picture.  A fun foundry.  Let me say.  That is amazing.  I forgot that you used to look like that.  Look at the size of you. 
[00:56:00]  Ramon, bring me repressed memories.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  That was from the Tito Ortiz thing.  Tito Ortiz strangled me in 12 seconds when I was 400 pounds.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good, Steve.  Jeez.  Thank you very much.  You feel better, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, a lot.  A lot.  I mean, you can, you know, all of a sudden you can fit in one seat.  You know, you can.  All right.  Enough.  All right.  Ramon, bring me some self-confidence.  Ramon, bring me the ability to plow through this. 
[00:56:30]  Let's go to Brian in California.  Good morning, guys.  We have big balls to make fun of him, man.  He can squash us like a great ball.  You just can't be scared of a guy in child shorts.  I'm sorry.  As much as Steve can knock my teeth out, I can't be afraid of a man in fucking child shorts.  What?  Triple X garanimals.  Why are they child shorts?  What is so wrong about these?  It's just because they're like past your little knees. 
[00:57:00]  Are you going to summer camp today?  Hey, spanky.  Those are very roomy, comfortable shorts.  Those are not bad shorts.  Yeah, big through the hips for a roomy.  A roomy.  Big shorts.  Oh, God.  A lot of fun already today.  Brian in California, what's up?  Hey, yeah.  I did the gastric bypass, too, and it's made a total change for me already, even being eight  months out already.  But I was right up there, too.  I weighed about 430, and I'm down 130 pounds, too.  It's a big change, and it's definitely not for everybody. 
[00:57:30]  You know, there's lots of stuff you have to deal with, and your guy knows all about it  because he's saying the same things that I was going to tell you, too.  It's just, it's a big change.  You've got to go through having to deal with what you can eat, what you can't eat.  A lot of people have problems with guffing when you try to put a little sugar in your  system, and all of a sudden you're puking, getting hot flashes, and got diarrhea all  at the same time.  Hot.  Yeah, well, people have to realize their addiction is going to be, they're going to  have to change their addiction.  It is.  My girlfriend, she did it, too. 
[00:58:00]  She did it a year ago, and she's going right back to the way that she was doing before,  and I'm hoping not to fall in the same category, but...  Your girlfriend was a big fatty, too?  Well, she weighed about 310.  Yeah.  So the answer to that question would be yes.  Yes.  Unequivocal.  Yes.  Yeah.  She's still a good girl, though, but...  Yeah, I don't regret it, and the fact that I'm still young.  You know, I've seen people that did it in their 40s and 50s, and they get lots of complications.  What are you going to do if you lose weight and she goes right back onto the place she 
[00:58:30]  was?  Oh, shit.  She's out of there.  Oh, good.  Actually, she's almost out of there now, so...  But that's a different story.  Yeah, I don't regret it.  I'm about 40 pounds away from my goal, and that's 250.  All right.  Well, very good.  Good luck, buddy.  Very good.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  You guys have a good one.  I just couldn't go there.  Sorry.  I thought you were going to.  I know.  I couldn't do it to the guy.  Well, he says that he dealt with his bigness, and I was going to go, when are you going 
[00:59:00]  to deal with your homosexuality?  He did sound like a smoker.  She is almost out of there.  She gets rid of that awful thing with teeth between her legs.  Dave in Boston.  The dirty spot.  Boys, sweet tits.  Home of Bernie and Phil.  What's up, Dave?  I've got to send you guys those commercials.  Bernie and Phil.  We've got a couple Bernie and Phil commercials.  They're not the best ones.  The second one's really good.  They've got their kids on there doing the commercials, too.  Yeah.  So, what's up there, Dave?  This morning, I was watching Channel 7 News.  The Viacom split. 
[00:59:30]  They had a clip of you guys on there with Stern.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What did Viacom split exactly?  From my understanding, I was half asleep.  But, I mean, Viacom split to something like CBS, blah, blah, blah.  I don't know.  I think they're...  Did they spin off Infinity?  Is that what it is?  I believe it is.  They're spinning off Infinity and making it part of some of the TV things they have.  Yeah, it looks like they had a departing shot of you guys leaving the studio or something like that.  Viacom's...  You've got their hands in a whole bunch of stuff.  So, they're trying to keep, like, their radio division and a couple of TV entities separate from the rest of the company. 
[01:00:00]  So, well, radio's been dragging down.  Infinity Broadcasting's been dragging Viacom stock down.  So, they figure if they split, Viacom will be able to not have to worry about that.  And then they'll try to build up the radio division again.  All right.  But they had a shot of us for some reason?  We haven't been with the company in over a year now.  Yeah, I didn't get it either.  We were one of the high-profile people.  Probably.  All right.  Love the show, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dave.  Much enough.  We've got a lot of people talking about their fatness here. 
[01:00:30]  was 472 pounds, was 450, lost 200 by just eating as much...  What?  Oh, now I have to go here.  Uh, J.R., what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Well, I like J.R. used to weigh, like, 450 pounds, man.  And I was in a size 54 in pants.  And I just one day figured out, hey, what the hell, I need to lose this,  because everybody's looking at me like I'm a big, fat whale. 
[01:01:00]  So, I lost 200 pounds just by not stuffing my fat face anymore.  So, you did it on your own, huh?  That's it, man.  I started exercising, eating right, and now I'm down to a size 38 in pants.  If I can do it, and I'm from West Virginia, and, no, I've got shoes on,  and I've got all my keys.  Well, apparently, you fucking used them for the years.  It's like a wood chipper.  But it was just something, it's hard to do at first, right? 
[01:01:30]  And then you start to see results, and it gets a little bit better.  Yeah, it was real hard at first.  I mean, it was like taking a bandsaw to me, taking my food away.  I mean, it was tough.  It was real bad.  That's good, man.  Did you have a little coming out party for your penis when you finally see it again?  Have you heard the nightmares of what fat guys go through with their schlong?  What?  The fat builds up in the pubis region.  It's a very fatty area, and it builds up and puffs up so much that it passes your schlong 
[01:02:00]  and buries it.  Makes you look like you're hung like an acorn.  You got nothing there.  Might as well be a vag.  It probably smells like urine all the time because you drip into it.  Would you tongue out the, like, under the helmet, like, especially if they're un...  La, la, la, la, la, I don't hear you.  Uncut.  La, la, la, la, la.  You are disgusting.  Uncliffed helmet of a fat man.  Oh, stop it.  Yeah, I want a cup of joe, too. 
[01:02:30]  Stop it.  Big Ben, how about a young fella coming here?  Hold on, hold on, let me make the official announcement that we do on this show.  Bill needs coffee.  Yeah.  How about when Ben flies and his mule is right in the seat with you?  How do you deal with that?  Every time he turns, I give the uncomfortable look.  Oh, sorry.  Jesus, who's this strapping model?  Oh, you weren't here for the new interns.  No.  Making their appearance.  This is young Clayton.  Hi, Clayton.  I don't.  I wouldn't have known that. 
[01:03:00]  He's wearing a name tag.  Good to wear these name tags.  Thank God.  I have no idea what their names are.  I know who Harry T is.  Yeah, because he came up with a couple of good bits.  That's right.  Al-Qaeda.  Already.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Al-Qaeda guy.  Oh, yeah, he did a good job.  You want some coffee?  Because young Clayton is here.  I'm going.  Bill needs coffee.  Grande ice.  Grande ice.  Yeah, let me get a medium iced latte with low-fat milk, please.  Medium iced latte, low-fat milk.  You might want to jot that down.  Uh-oh.  Paul will help you out.  No, these guys are good so far.  Really good.  So far, no Rickies. 
[01:03:30]  No Rickies in the bunch.  And nothing for me today, thank you.  All right, we're going to take our first break.  Why don't we go to Yellow Discipline?  Jim Norton.  Oh!  Jim Norton, the star of the show today after his huge appearance on Leno the other night.  Real star.  A real star on our program.  The Elephant on Southwest.  We'll play that off Yellow Discipline.  And your new CD is now available on eatabullet.com.  Yes.  It's called?  Trinkets I Own Made from Gorilla Hens.  All right, but off his first CD, we go to break with this.  Just can't stand his phony niceness. 
[01:04:00]  That's why I like Southwest Airlines.  The only airline I really support emotionally.  Ever since they booted those big fat people off the plane.  Yeah, good for them.  I'm not talking.  These are not people.  I'm not saying that somebody that's 300, 325.  It's America.  We eat good.  I overindulge.  We all do.  You ever see somebody so fat it makes you angry?  Like you want to grab them by their 12XL shirt.  How did you get so fat?  And I'm talking in the area of 700, 750. 
[01:04:30]  You know, like you ever see somebody so fat they sit on the couch, their legs stick straight out?  If you have legs like baby arms, change your eating habits.  And of course, we're such a pathetic, litigious society.  You know, you sue for everything now.  They're suing the airlines.  You know, we don't think we should have to pay for two seats.  Yeah, well, I don't think I should be uncomfortable because you're repressing childhood rape memories with pure fat and carbohydrates. 
[01:05:00]  You don't want to pay for two seats?  Fine.  Hire a horse trailer to pull you to your destination.  And hang your fat jowls out the back and chew oats for 3,200 miles, you monster with no willpower. 
[01:05:30]  We're a good crowd, man.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  How can I honestly say?  Anybody rips me off.  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes off in the cars. 
[01:06:00]  Dude, get with it.  All right.  Well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know...  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car? 
[01:06:30]  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing frisbees to their cars.  Jump and grab it.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Beep.  Beep.  Dude.  Honk, dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  I bent down.  Wow, it was such an original idea. 
[01:07:00]  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I did it all.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  Killed themselves.  Right.  I've done it all.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  I was the first one to do anything.  I cracked the...  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the...  What was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented S.O.S.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin. 
[01:07:30]  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw...  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow,  Uh, girls would get naked in the car?  That was...  It wasn't even flat.  Yeah, girls would get naked. 
[01:08:00]  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called a fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on it.  Ooh, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  I invented that.  Kirby and Anthony.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:08:30]  Let it roll, baby, roll.  Let it roll, baby, roll.  Let it roll, baby, roll.  Let it roll.  Let it roll, let it roll.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony program.  What version is this?  I don't know.  Who does this?  I don't know.  You don't know?  It's The Crystal Method. 
[01:09:00]  It's Roadhouse Blues.  Okay.  Oh, we like those guys.  I kind of like The Crystal Method.  It's Roadhouse Blues.  I know that much, Dirk.  I apologize.  It's a song by an up-and-coming band called The Doors.  All right, Disney.  We were talking about this yesterday, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Of course, the headlines, Death at Disney.  Death at Disney.  Death at Disney.  And just like we said yesterday, the ride is now open.  Disney officials said the ride was closed. 
[01:09:30]  For your recreational pleasure.  For a day, but reopened yesterday.  What ride was this again?  It was a mission Mars at Epcot.  And it's one of those simulators where you go in, you sit down in a seat, there's a screen  in front of you, a lot of spacey stuff around you, and they play some kind of a video sequence  on the screen in front of you.  And it's then combined with some kind of a simulator that's moving around, that simulates motion. 
[01:10:00]  So that combined with the video really fools your senses.  And they've gotten really good at this.  The difference with this, as opposed to something like Star Tours, which was a huge Disney ride  years ago, where you'd get on this ride, they'd play the video sequence, you're sitting in a box pretty much  with about 15, 20 other people, and it's on stilts that are on hydraulics.  So the video shows that you're turning left, and all of a sudden, they rock this unit one way. 
[01:10:30]  I'm not drinking that.  What is that?  What is that?  I can't believe he's talking.  Are you insane?  I'm on a roll here.  It's going to rip your throat out.  Wow, they just derailed me, my friend.  He's in the middle of the thing.  He comes in and goes, yeah, you might have some sugar here.  Yeah, some sugar here.  Here's the coffee.  I don't understand how important the coffee is, but this is the show part of the show.  This is the talking into the microphone. 
[01:11:00]  This is the whole reason we're here.  All this other stuff doesn't mean shit.  Everything else is peripheral.  Right.  I got thrown out, and I was listening.  Oh, I know.  I just started laughing.  I've been a better listener lately, but I thought he was going to hand me that.  I'm not drinking that.  I'm sorry.  Okay, young Clayton.  Where's the milk?  That's fine.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  It's got to be.  Oh, boy.  No, Rick, it's got to be, like.  No, Rick.  That's okay.  Don't look at me.  That's why I don't ask for anything.  I can't be disappointed.  I brought my own milk, young Eric. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, poor young Clayton now.  He's sighing.  I am sighing.  He's sighing.  You can listen to the replay, and you'll hear that I asked for milk.  You did?  I'm not even going to go into it.  Let's go to the record.  Listen.  Eric, I brought my own milk.  Oh, he walked out.  He shook his head, put his head down, and went, I blew it, man.  I blew the coffee.  And look at that room.  They are all just laughing their asses off.  That's right.  Ben and Derek just laughing.  Travis has someone to laugh at now. 
[01:12:00]  They're pumping fists in the air.  Too goddamn funny.  That was kind of funny.  I was really, yeah, I hear some sugar, and, oh, you're talking?  Sorry.  Yeah, sorry.  Doing a show here.  Well, that's the beauty of the show.  It's almost like we're not doing a show, and some people get a little thrown.  And they feel that sometimes, where they can just barge in, and just kind of, hey, the  guys are just hanging out.  It's a social club.  That's all it is.  All right, so I'm back with you, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  You're talking about the rides that make you feel, which, by the way, I got most of the  rides that got once.  They really feel like you're on.  They really do.  It really fools your senses, and you feel like you're moving when, in fact, you're just kind 
[01:12:30]  of being thrown around up and down.  Right.  The difference with this one, though, Mission Space, is it's on a centrifuge.  So you're sitting in this thing, and at some point, it'll start spinning around with your  back toward the outside of the spinning.  Now, what this does is press you in your seat so hard during this launch sequence.  You're looking out the window, which is the video display, and you see yourself being  launched into space, and now the centrifuge starts spinning faster and faster. 
[01:13:00]  You feel the pressure on your body pushing you back into the seat.  Are you spinning, or the thing behind you is spinning?  You're actually spinning.  This whole thing is on a spindle, and it starts spinning, but now you don't get any visual cues  of your spinning.  So you're not seeing yourself spinning.  You're looking at the video.  It looks like you're going straight forward.  The spinning makes pressure that pushes you back, so you're not feeling yourself spinning.  You're feeling yourself getting pushed in the seat and looking at yourself going forward. 
[01:13:30]  So the illusion is that you are accelerating forward at an amazing speed.  Now, if you're a four-year-old child on this ride with no history of any problems, but you're  four.  How do you put it?  People have to understand what some of these rides actually do.  You know, it's not just you're going to sit there and watch a movie.  You know, that you're actually, you're experiencing G-forces.  But I think if you're a parent, you're just thinking, ah, Disney says it's okay for my four-year-old,  so it's got to be okay. 
[01:14:00]  There's no age requirement.  There's a height requirement.  There's just a height requirement.  Apparently, the kid reached the 44-inch height requirement, even though he's four.  Like a monster.  Someone's saying that the ride was developed by NASA.  Well, that's pretty obvious that they would be involved in something like that, right?  I would puke all over spinning like that.  Oh, I hate those things.  There have been six hospitalizations in eight months on this ride for people complaining  of chest pains and nausea on the ride.  How long have you spent on the ride?  I have no idea how long the ride is or how long you're spinning, but apparently it's, you 
[01:14:30]  know, this ride's a little intense.  This isn't just going on, you know, one of these little rides that has some movie playing  in front of you.  Basically, they're describing what happened.  You know, when the ride started, the kid was all right, but as the ride continued, he  grew rigid and his legs were extended, according to police.  Sounds like a visit to Neverland.  Same results with the little child.  His mother, Agnes, thought the youngster was...  Michael becomes rigid, too.  His mother, Agnes, thought the youngster was scared because of the gravity-defying effects, 
[01:15:00]  so she clutched his hand, but when the ride ended, he had stopped breathing.  Oh, Jesus, Jesus, that's incredible.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Otto had the goddamn line of the day yesterday.  Oh, he did come in?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't hear him shit.  He did great.  Of course he did.  The kid taken to the hospital, and did they put a little Snoopy toe tag on him?  On that little foot?  That's horrible.  You've got to wonder if the hospital does have little special ones for the kids. 
[01:15:30]  Because they've got a little special everything, a little admitting wristbands with little  animals on them or something.  Might as well work at the morgue, too.  Yeah, I heard he was coming in.  I only heard part of the replay, and I should have annoyed I missed that.  He was really good yesterday.  He did a great job.  He was just tired that one day.  He's one of the funniest guys in life.  All right, let's say hi to Steve the Trucker.  He's been on the ride.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Yeah, I read that ride a couple years ago, and I read some reviews on it before I went to 
[01:16:00]  Dizzy World.  They tell you, whatever you do, don't take your eyes off a screen in front of you.  Because if you do, you get really dizzy.  Yeah, you need the visual cues or else your inner ear takes over and makes you vomit.  Yeah.  After I read that ride, it lasted about maybe four or five minutes of that, but I was sick  all day long, dizzy.  And how old is it?  Yeah, it really screws up your equilibrium.  This ride's ridiculous.  The simulation of when the rocket blasts off, you get sucked back in your seat so hard, I  tried to reach my hand up to fix my glasses.  I couldn't even raise my arm.  Yeah, it pins you back into the seat. 
[01:16:30]  If you take your eyes off that screen, you just get dizzy innocently.  It's pretty gross.  Yeah, I went on one when I was a little kid, nothing that advanced.  It was like one of those roller coaster ones where you're in that box.  Yeah.  I had to go outside.  I was wearing shorts and black socks.  I was a nerd, and I had to lay down on the bench.  I felt nauseous.  My uncles, Mike and Joe, were with me.  Yeah.  I was that guy growing up.  Big family.  We'd go to the amusement park, and I would be sitting out most of the rides with, I forget,  maybe my sister or something, doing the same thing, laying on the bench, trying to get  my equilibrium back. 
[01:17:00]  I'm not one for rides.  I don't like rides that go fast.  I don't like rides that go upside down.  I don't like spinning rides.  I will go to Disney, and I will go on, you know.  Welcome to the Wonder of the Seas.  This ride will take you on an adventure throughout the seas of the world.  Look to the left.  It's a blowfish.  You know, and I'm just kind of, oh, this is good.  We're doing like .3 miles per hour, and I'm learning something.  Sure.  You know, I'll go to another ride, and it's just teaching you about something else, and 
[01:17:30]  you know, teaches you about the human body.  Things like that are fine by me.  The Haunted House, maybe.  Ooh, that's good.  I like that one.  Yeah.  You're going through.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Let's go to Bill in Indiana.  Is the room stretching?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  They're never scary.  No.  You want to scare people?  Why don't you update it and stop with the dumb masks?  How about, like, you go around one corner, and there's a Haitian with a needle he just  used stumbling towards you?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:18:00]  Disney Imagineers have upgraded the ride.  Yo, man, which way is north?  Whoa, this is scary.  We finally have a sound effect for when we go down that road, by the way, Ant.  When we talk about those things?  Yeah, let's listen to what Steve put together here.  Yeah, which way is north?  Oh, well, let me see.  It's right.  Rocking the last clock, Mr. Steve. 
[01:18:30]  I nailed it.  That's the chain of events, man.  It's a hot, sweltering day.  Someone asked you for directions.  Bam.  Hey, it's Christmas.  Let's say hi to Bill in Indiana.  I have a question for Steve about that, actually, if he'll come.  All right, Bill.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I was just wondering, is the spinning of the ride, is that creating gravity?  All right.  I will admit, Professor Anthony was correct, and I was incorrect, which I figured was made apparent. 
[01:19:00]  And what's more important, will Professor Anthony ever be sitting on Leno's couch discussing gravity with him?  Good point.  Probably not.  Jay and I talked about that in the dressing room.  He goes, you didn't know what gravity was, stupid.  Let's go to Mark in Connecticut.  Everyone knows it's mass, and then all of a sudden, the object started sticking to his big chin.  Go ahead, Mark.  Oh, good.  How are you this morning?  All right.  Hey, guys.  First off, Jimmy, you just rocked it the other night. 
[01:19:30]  That was awesome.  Thanks, man.  I just want to make a comment about that ride down in Connecticut, yeah, in Mission Space.  That ruined my entire vacation when I was down there last year.  We went on that ride.  My wife and I went on it.  It's our second day out of, like, five days down there.  And we said, okay, you know, it's first day in the morning, nice and early.  We're going to be the first ones on that ride.  We went on to that big minute ride after that.  We couldn't even handle that ride after that. 
[01:20:00]  It just kills you.  Dude, all rides make me very, very badly motion sick.  I have horrible motion sickness, so I can't go in.  I'm like Anthony, man.  I'll go to one.  Yeah.  Two miles an hour, a little informative thing, or even a haunted house where you go up a teeny little hill and down.  Anything else I'm finished.  I like Pirates of the Caribbean.  There you go.  Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.  Arr!  And then you watch them.  You're going real slow in the little boat, and you watch them up on the sides.  They're chasing the ladies.  They're drinking the booze.  They're shooting their guns.  The little dog is holding the keys just far enough out of the little prisoner's reach. 
[01:20:30]  Can't grab the keys.  And they're going, whew, whew, whew, whew.  And they're little animatronic faces.  That's great.  That's all I need.  No fast rides for me.  I'm a pussy.  To end the death at Disney story, here it is.  The ride was closed after the tragedy, but reopened yesterday morning.  That's it.  Hose it down.  You think they'll change the ride, though?  Will this four-year-old wreck it for everyone else?  What'd he die of?  Is it a heart attack?  I was going to say, the kid stopped breathing.  Yeah, well, why not? 
[01:21:00]  That's what it was, and they couldn't revive him.  Brought him to the hospital.  It's absolutely awful.  Dead.  But do you think they put a sign there with a little kid with the X's over his eyes?  A little Disney trying to resuscitate him.  A little Mickey over him trying to resuscitate him.  But do you think it was just a sign that said, closed for maintenance, with a waving Mickey?  Sorry.  I wonder if there was an admission refund, how they went about that.  Like, look, we understand that it was, what, $39.95?  Oh, my God.  And the happy photos you took coming into the park. 
[01:21:30]  Ah, we'll just give you those for free.  Now, on the ride, you'll be going through the ride and see some roadside crosses for the little kid,  little stuffed animals on that seat.  In the seat, a little cross.  A little blue bunny strapped into that seat.  Well, even better.  You know everyone going on that ride today, they're all thinking as they go in there,  they're guessing what seat it was.  Death ride, yeah.  What seat was the one with the dead kid in it?  You think it was that seat right there?  It's either this empty one or the one with the pile of shit in it.  Holy shit. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, look, it's awful.  What the?  Phew.  What?  What the?  This guy, Ed from Miami, says,  I'm an annual pass holder for Disney, was invited to the premiere of Mission Space,  and the ride was so violent at first it had to be toned down.  Eric, Eric.  People are passing out and puking all over the place.  That's because of the motion, probably, the spinning.  People probably take their eyes off it and they vomit.  Eric, you can't write things down.  You've got to just say them.  I can't.  Yeah, he does that to me all the time.  It drives me nuts.  What is that?  Eric, you're part of the show.  If you have something, you just jump on mine.  Just say it. 
[01:22:30]  It bombs.  Make it like a man.  Yeah, he's trying to pawn it off on other people.  Yeah, that's like, here's the one that bombs.  Oh, well.  It's yours, yeah.  Saying the reason.  Shut up!  No, who cares?  I can't believe you fell for that again.  Like we really.  Drop the mic.  Like we really care what you have to say.  Jesus.  Figure it out.  No, it says, um.  Why are you ripping up his little joke?  Because it said Disney dollar refund, which was not a bad line if I hadn't said it two minutes ago.  Right. 
[01:23:00]  Didn't you just say that?  Hold on, let me write something down for Ant.  All right.  Do a little Pirates of the Caribbean.  There you go.  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  Damn you, Hawk.  All right, very good, Hawk.  So they hosed down the ride and they moved on like they do down there, right?  Just like they did.  I remember the last, I think the last person that died there, it was on that, um, the riverboats.  And that was a horrific one.  Can I get a help?  At least this one was just, you know, the lifeless child being brought out of the ride.  The one with the, well, yeah, that's pretty bad. 
[01:23:30]  At least this one is just.  It's just the lifeless child.  Listen to this one, how this guy died.  This, uh, couple is waiting to go on one of those big riverboats.  They got the one with the paddle wheel.  And this is at Disneyland.  They have another one.  It's, uh, and they, they go around a circle on the lake.  They stop, load up people, and they're off.  Uh, the Columbia was coming in and it was coming in a little too fast.  It's on a track, but these boats actually have engines that are, uh, operated by, by crew members.  And you can slow it down or speed it up. 
[01:24:00]  It doesn't come in at a set speed.  They were coming in a little too fast.  So, I guess to slow it down, they decided they would just take the rope and throw it over the cleat on the dock and stop this 100-ton ship that's built up quite a bit of momentum.  Uh, the cleat ripped out of the dock and flung the rope and the cleat into some Asian guy's head.  Right into his head.  Bam!  Dead! 
[01:24:30]  Right on the spot.  Wow.  Boom!  And, literally, they had to come out and hose it down.  And, uh, did they stop it?  Hell no!  No!  Get the crew.  Get a couple of drill screws.  Put that, uh, put that cleat back on.  And his poor wife is trying to tell people that her husband was killed by a crete.  And they're like, what?  Didn't know if she was happy or sad.  Either her husband just died or she enjoyed a ride. 
[01:25:00]  One or the other.  You can only tell, well, it's just her in the car.  I guess something's wrong.  There's a bunch of relatives holding flowers.  Is it Valentine's Day?  Wait.  No, there's a box.  Ah, I see.  Jesus.  When it comes down to it, none of our lives mean anything.  Especially at Disney.  Especially when it comes to commerce.  Just keep it moving, people.  Keep it moving.  All right.  It's not the crew, I'm being reminded.  They're all called cast members there at Disney.  Ooh!  The people that work there, they're called cast members. 
[01:25:30]  I didn't know that.  Of course.  All right, Anthony, uh, did anyone else see the, uh, the cartoon in the New York Post about  Michael Jackson?  Oh, yeah.  Michael Jackson, uh.  This guy, man.  It's, it's, I love seeing this, because, uh, the guy takes major chances and, and gets  away with it in, in cartoon form.  You want to describe this?  Yes, it'll be like, uh, LaGuardia during the, uh, the strike, the newspaper strike.  I'll just read the, uh, the comic strip to you.  Would he really do that?  That...  Of course he did.  Would he, out of work, union workers really laugh at the funnies?  The funnies. 
[01:26:00]  What'd blondies say?  And now, here's, uh, the first panel.  Ugh.  Michael Jackson's victory party.  And it's got, uh, Michael sitting at a table.  Very party atmosphere going on.  Uh, Bubbles the Chimp is at a, is at a, at a seat.  There seems to be a snake smoking a cigarette.  Yeah, I don't get the snake.  He's the lawyer.  He's the lawyer.  Lawyer.  Oh, he's the lawyer.  Oh, very good.  Very good, Jimmy.  I was trying to figure that out all morning.  That's good.  And then the Elephant Man.  And the Elephant Man Bones.  Bones.  Right.  They're in another, uh, seat, and they're all raising their hands up and cheering as 
[01:26:30]  music is playing, because they're happy, because, uh, for the celebration, there is  a huge cake in the middle of the table.  The top has a hinge on it.  It is opened up, and what is coming out of the cake but a naked young boy?  That is very funny.  Yeah.  Can I ask, though, what, again, I have to do this, why is that acceptable?  And yet, if on this program you make fun of some kid's death or something awful, it's  unacceptable.  Why is one considered, uh, legitimate and one not?  If that's in a, um, a newspaper.  Ah.  And we're a comedy show. 
[01:27:00]  The post is a newspaper?  That's what they say.  Wow.  Honestly.  Mm-hmm.  But this guy's making fun of child molesting.  Yeah, I know.  It's very funny.  I love the post cartoons.  They are great.  The guy takes chances all the time and gets away with pretty much murder with these,  uh, with these, uh, cartoons or whatever.  So, all right.  Speaking of Michael Jackson.  By the way, can I interrupt real quick?  Sure.  You're with De Niro walking for the American Express commercial.  Now, like, Brad Pitt's doing, like, and, uh, why do they, like, when Dennis Franz did 
[01:27:30]  the Nextel, why do they think they're not really doing commercials if they don't mention  the product name?  Oh, if they're just talking, uh, De Niro just talks about living in New York and Tribeca  and, uh, uh, his New York.  And then it's tagged at the end with an announcer and an American Express logo.  It's like, Bob, Bob, Bob, do you really think that you're not doing a commercial?  Dennis Franz, did your people tell you that you're not doing a Nextel commercial because  you won't mention the product name?  You're doing a commercial?  It's fine.  I don't mind you doing a commercial.  You should do them.  I think it's, it isn't as bad if you're not hawking the product yourself. 
[01:28:00]  It's almost like they're showing a short film of you.  American Express is showing a short film starring you and they will sell the product.  You're just an attention getter.  That's it.  But, but they go over to Japan and put on like wacky kung fu outfits and try to sell soda  over there for millions of dollars.  That's a huge industry, uh, for, for Hollywood actors.  They go to Japan and do commercials, the hackiest, worst Japanese commercials for beer and soda 
[01:28:30]  and food products.  And they're awful and embarrassing, but we don't see them.  So they keep their credibility and they're able to pocket huge amounts of money.  I know why they do it because we don't know they're hacky and bad.  And then embarrassing because it's in another language.  In another language.  Hoo-cha!  Visually looks good.  Like, hey, Brad Pitt's selling coke.  Cool.  Well, it looks really, they, they look kind of bad though.  They really put them in a bad life.  Why don't we get them?  We never see them.  How can we never get to see them here?  I don't know.  I think that's probably part of their contract in order to do the commercial that they don't  release them anywhere else.  I wouldn't doubt it. 
[01:29:00]  They never allowed to be sold to an American.  Try to protect themselves.  Yeah.  Every once in a while you see them on like a commercial clip show or something with little show actors  doing those foreign commercials.  Where we sit as Americans and sit and watch an entire program dedicated to commercials.  Yes, I know.  I love, don't you love Nick at Night though or TV Land when you see like an old commercial  like, I'm Mother Nature.  Yeah.  Those are really cool to watch.  I'm a nostalgia idiot.  Me too.  I would watch that forever.  I'd go on the computer sometimes and you could punch up classic commercials or TV shows,  PSAs, things like that. 
[01:29:30]  Remember that one that was an anti-smoking PSA years ago where it was, the voiceover would  just say, like father, like son.  And it would show them fishing or something.  And then the last one was like, like father, like son.  And the father starts smoking a cigarette and the kid grabs a pack of cigarettes and stops  with some ominous music.  No?  That one I don't remember at all.  And I think the music was, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, some groovy 70s music.  Me and Groucho would sit and watch this and laugh.  It was hysterical. 
[01:30:00]  How about the, I want a Coke and the world would have.  I like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony.  Perfect harmony.  That was a great commercial, yeah, man.  Yeah, that was a biggie.  All right, here's the deal.  So we got Michael Jackson, Geraldo.  We finally got the Geraldo audio.  Geraldo.  Oh, now Geraldo, who has been backing Michael Jackson this entire time, just to get him  on his show.  Michael Jackson was like exclusively talking to Geraldo and Fox News.  And that's it. 
[01:30:30]  And the only reason he was doing that is because Geraldo was just pushing for this guy.  He was saying how it's an outrage, how there's no evidence against him and he will  be acquitted.  And God damn it, he was right.  And now I guess he's got more exclusives with Michael Jackson.  Of course.  Is that it?  Now Michael Jackson is going to be doing Geraldo?  Yeah, you got to think he's got something in the works with him.  So let's go to the audio.  Geraldo announces to 747 Jackson is innocent.  What's that mean?  Does anyone know that? 
[01:31:00]  No.  To the plane?  On a plane?  Adam, what's up, buddy?  Hey there, pal.  Hey, James.  How are you, buddy?  Adam Ferrari in studio.  You brought your toothbrush and toothpaste with you.  I just got up.  I'm tired.  Did you brush?  Hi, James.  You want to brush live on the show?  Yeah.  Give me some water.  We'll do everything else.  Why not?  Well, get a bucket of...  What is kind of sociopathic of it?  Get a bucket of water.  What is this?  That's deodorant.  You knew I was going to stink?  Just in case.  No, that is...  We all use it.  That's the right guard sport that Jimmy's turning everyone on to. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  And what is that, James?  It has a lock feature.  It's so powerful.  Good stuff.  Watch this.  It's like a rocket.  How do you not try that?  Come here.  You got it.  It's unbelievable.  It smells good, too.  Does one have to shake?  No, don't shake.  Are you crazy?  It's really going to go on here.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, just...  Yeah.  If you over...  Hold it away about...  Hold it away about eight inches.  Wait, wait.  What kind of PSI do we have in here?  It's pretty strong there, my friend.  You'll hear.  You'll hear fine.  It's like a Wagner power sprayer. 
[01:32:00]  It's nice.  Feels good, huh?  Teehee.  You like that?  Oh, go to commercial.  I want to do it on my bull.  A little tickle.  Everyone's teeheeing.  It's just sack.  Open your cheeks.  There you go.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's a nice way to start the day, James.  Smells good, too.  Good morning.  And it also wrecks the environment.  Yeah.  Bye-bye, clouds.  We still want to do an experiment.  We want to light a match and hit that...  No, that'll flame up real bad.  Get an intern.  Okay, here we go.  So, Geraldo announces to 747.  What does that mean?  Do you know, Eric? 
[01:32:30]  What is the headline there?  What are you doing?  It just says, Geraldo announces to 747, Jackson is innocent.  It's got to be an announcement on a plane?  On a plane?  Let's play the clip and find out.  Yelling outside up at the sky?  Yelling outside.  I didn't think of that outside the plane.  Damn you.  It has a megaphone.  You people up there.  Jackson is innocent.  I let out a huge hoop and a holler, and I stood up and I announced to the entire Jumbo  Jet that Michael Jackson had been found not guilty.  Good.  Now let him watch you kids.  Kids were crying. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Ah, this guy.  Geraldo's just an ass.  Of course he is.  He just likes Michael Jackson because he'd open his closet and he knows he'd find something.  Something's coming out.  Not like the Al Capone's vault.  Embarrassing non-journalist ass you.  Finally, nothing is in here.  After two hours, I found a bottle.  He found like a bottle, and that was it.  Did he drink out of this?  Yeah.  Who knows?  That was one of the biggest debacles on television.  You know what?  It got his name out there.  It made him even more famous. 
[01:33:30]  What an ass, though, man.  You should take a peek beforehand.  Of course.  And make believe, you know?  We're digging through this wall, and then he did a whole, like, history of Al Capone,  and oh, it was horrible.  And then they finally get in there, nothing.  A waste.  What did they find, really?  Like, nothing.  They found a bottle.  Yeah.  And there was all this speculation as to what might be back there.  So they were saying perhaps it's one of his old cars that he liked, or money, booze.  Dead witnesses.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Some homeless guy dropped off a booze bottle like five years ago. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  It's an empty vault.  All right.  Here we go.  Geraldo.  Jackson now knows sleeping with boys is wrong.  These were a band of gypsy grifters who latched onto Michael Jackson, who had this abominable,  bizarre habit of sleeping with other people's children, however innocent.  Michael knows now that that conduct is unacceptable.  He will never do it again.  And if he does, I'll bust him for it.  Oh, boy, Geraldo. 
[01:34:30]  You've got a whole bust him.  Am I going to sleep better now?  Hey, get your hands off that boy.  Why is Geraldo outside my bedroom?  Geraldo.  Geraldo will bust him.  What an ass.  Take your goddamn hands off him.  Leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  What's the rule?  No touching.  All right.  Here's Geraldo.  He's talking about Court TV here.  The media led by Court TV. 
[01:35:00]  That was absolutely the most unprofessional, hysterical kind of coverage you could ever imagine.  Oh.  Does he work for Fox News?  Yeah.  You're Geraldo.  Geraldo.  If Mike Wallace were saying that, it would have some merit.  But Geraldo, this is your thing.  Don't you remember?  Like the star calling the Inquirer cheap.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't you remember having a television show there, Geraldo?  Where you decided it was a great idea to put the Klan together with some black people.  And you got your nose broke with a chair. 
[01:35:30]  You made Morton Downey Jr. look like Cronkite, you sap.  What's the matter with you?  Big mustachioed PR.  Yeah.  Circus champ with that mustache.  He meets like a top hat.  And then the center ring.  Ladies and gentlemen.  He really should be tying somebody to railroad tracks in 1920 with that stupid stash.  Piano music playing in the background.  Snidely whiplash.  Uh-uh.  All right, one more clip from Geraldo.  Absolutely not.  That mother is unfit to have those children. 
[01:36:00]  She's the unfit parent.  Not Michael Jackson.  Well, Michael fits just fine.  Have you?  One of the jurors said he thinks that Michael is a child molester.  But they just didn't prove their case.  Right.  He said, I do think that Michael molested boys.  It's another case where he's not innocent of the crime.  They just didn't.  They again screwed up the case.  And you know what?  I'll bet you they did.  I'll bet you legally they did not prove the case.  Because again, they're the typical celebrity lawyer that gets the client off.  It's amazing.  And Michael Jackson has enough money, enough seclusion to do this kind of thing and not 
[01:36:30]  conjure up a load of evidence against him.  He just has that.  He's acted so wacky for so many years that he can almost explain away these things as  part of his wacky personality.  You put them all together, it's very hard to get evidence against this guy.  I think it's a very calculated thing he's done over the years so he can continue his  first love, which is molesting children.  I think he's just nuts.  You don't sit there going, if I buy the bones of the elephant man and sleep in an oxygen table, 
[01:37:00]  I'll be able to touch the children.  I think he likes putting that persona out there.  I don't think he's as crazy as he is.  Oh, I think he feeds the nuttiness.  Because you talk to people that have hung out with him and the cameras aren't rolling,  and they say, yeah, he actually carries on conversations about real things and he's not  wearing the mask and the glove.  I think this is very calculated.  It might have started on his part to try to get some kind of mystique around him when  his career was really hot, but now I think he sees it as a great way to continue molesting 
[01:37:30]  children.  And she was an awful witness.  They lost the case.  She's a terrible witness.  Because, you know, she snapped her finger.  She just seemed like a scam artist, and she was.  I think she is a scam artist.  Yeah.  I do think that he's a molester, too.  I mean, that's my opinion.  It doesn't mean that he's not a molester, because the mother is a scam artist.  I mean, look, I'm not a molester.  I've never molested a kid in my life.  But look, if I had the picket litter, who knows?  I mean, you know, God Almighty, so svelte.  Who knows what you do?  A bunch of shirtless youngsters. 
[01:38:00]  Right there in your bedroom.  Maybe it starts off, you're putting lotion on a boy's back.  Maybe he caught a burn.  Okay.  Out there on the merry-go-round.  Out at Neverland.  You know, you put him out there, and he needs a little lotion.  That's right.  Maybe he looks at your face and thinks it's like a little horse happens to hop on us.  And you go, ah, why tell him?  Well, I disappoint the child.  Michael Jackson's attorney was on Larry King last night, Anthony.  And he says that Jackson is not a pedophile.  Let's go to the tape.  Michael Jackson is not a pedophile. 
[01:38:30]  He's never been a pedophile.  The prosecution has spent years trying to put together a story which they hoped they could prove and failed to prove.  Michael Jackson is not a pedophile.  He's never molested a child, nor would he ever even conceive of doing such a thing.  So these were concocted stories?  Well, certainly they were concocted by the main accusers, and certainly the prosecution tried to create the impression that other people were molested, and they all came in and said they weren't.  Didn't one of the kids know what his penis looked like, though? 
[01:39:00]  Yes.  Why did Larry King say, why did he pay them off?  Why did he pay them off, and how is a child going to know what Michael Jackson's penis looked like?  Did Larry King ask those questions?  No.  Why, you softball lobbing, fucking nine-wide having nothing?  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  Larry King stinks.  He really does just throw softball questions.  Why don't you ask, why, okay, Mark, why did he pay them off?  And he never has a follow-up question, ever.  Why?  And you think the lawyer would actually have an answer for that?  He would have lawyer talk for how it never happened. 
[01:39:30]  Well, you know, sometimes in a case you have to, hey, whoa, whoa, look, why, let's ask this, why did he pay off kids?  Why don't you ask Michael that?  Michael has been a victim of this kind of thing in the past, and he paid this off to minimize the bad press that he would have gotten.  $25 million?  He didn't do it.  $25 million?  Okay, he's a pedophile.  Kind of boy.  He has children in the ass.  I got him off.  I'm famous now.  Let's go to Eric in New York City.  And ask Michael why he hired Rutger Hauer to be his lawyer. 
[01:40:00]  That's good.  Eric, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Make it fast.  We've got to get back to this audio.  If you remember, Harada talking about professionalism, he was giving away ordinance in the sand of where the troops were at this war that's going on.  Yeah, remember that?  He got thrown out of Iraq by the United States military.  Another thing I want to mention, this Garagos guy, the lawyer for Jackson, do you remember?  They switched attorneys with Scott Peterson. 
[01:40:30]  He was defending Peterson.  Right, right, right.  So Peterson technically should have stayed with that attorney.  He would have walked.  Nah, I don't know about that.  Yes, I don't think so.  Mesereau is good, though, man.  This guy's a great lawyer.  And look, I don't fault him.  He's doing his job.  The prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  And I never faulted Cochran either.  Lawyers are doing, jealously guarding the rights of their clients, the interests of their clients.  That's their job.  Yeah, it's their job.  But he was just the scummy race card play and way he went about it. 
[01:41:00]  You're right, absolutely.  The discrediting the cop.  You know, just because Furman was a racist and using naughty language doesn't mean he planted a glove anywhere.  Agreed.  O.J. running past that air conditioner, bangs into it.  The time is perfect for him running and then getting in and answering the doorbell like the guy's been ringing for 15 minutes.  The guy obviously did it.  And they explained it all the way as Mark Furman planted it because he had some kind of vendetta against black people. 
[01:41:30]  But Darden saying, try the glove on.  Marsha Clark didn't talk to him for a week after that.  I know.  That blunder with no payoff.  Yeah.  And it didn't fit because of whatever reason.  But, I mean, try the glove on.  And the jury doesn't want to convict him.  They don't want to convict O.J. Simpson.  You soak a leather glove in blood and let it sit for a while, that thing is going to contract up and not fit.  Yeah, it was all crusted over.  That's what it was.  It was crusted.  And the way you try to make it look like you're putting a glove on, you can take a regular glove.  I can make it look like it's not fitting.  Right, right, right.  And bend your fingers up like that. 
[01:42:00]  He's acting.  And he had a plastic glove underneath it.  When you're getting set for a murder, you're not putting on perfect clothes.  I mean, stupid me, if I was going to do a murder, I'd get baggy clothes just in case, gloves that wouldn't fit.  Two different size shoes.  Yeah, the shoes.  There were two people here, each with one leg.  Drag a tail behind you.  I'm a genius.  What murderer makes sure that his outfit is perfect, you know?  I wear a size nine, half, ten shoe.  I'd get twelves.  Yeah.  You know, just to throw it all off. 
[01:42:30]  Obviously, they were killed by a brontosaurus.  The brontosaurus, I can't even say that.  You can see, it was a pack of raptors.  They were dragon's hails.  And O.J. exaggerated the Eternity.  Oh, he was acting.  It looked like the naked gun.  I would have had the lawyers there, I would have said, look, come on, no, try that glove on, you know?  What are you doing?  You know what you do?  You get a guy with a bigger hand than O.J. to slide it right on and go, look, tell the actor to put this on like he did that night.  But Darden is an incompetent, and Marsha Clark, that dumb broad.  She was too worried about her image. 
[01:43:00]  But Johnny Cochran, you dumb bitch, because the L.A. prosecutor, they didn't want to get a white guy to prosecute a black man,  so they got a black man and a white woman because they figured that would be less threatening for the jury.  Yep.  That's what you get for thinking in those terms.  That's what they always do.  You get a guy that's up on rape charges, he will always have a woman lawyer.  Always.  Always have a woman lawyer.  And his lawyer is ferocious.  Yeah.  I mean, she's good.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Cochran was undefeated in L.A.  He never lost to those L.A. prosecutors. 
[01:43:30]  He was undefeated because he was good, and they were incompetent.  I'm sorry.  They're not good.  And I met one of those guys.  One of those guys came into the comedy show.  The guy who was originally supposed to prosecute the case but had heart problems.  Yeah.  A white guy with a beard.  You'd know him if you saw him.  He was in all the footage.  Yeah, I can't remember his name.  Hodgman.  Bill Hodgman.  But he had some kind of a heart murmur or something, so they took him off the case.  That was the excuse they gave.  And he came in.  He signed an autograph for me.  He just wrote, Jim, he was guilty.  Bill Hodgman.  He didn't write his name.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  That's pretty cool.  Cochran did lose one case.  The case of old pudding brain.  That's right.  What are you doing?  There's a softball on the brain stem.  Softball versus the brain stem.  Couldn't talk his way out of that.  Yeah.  Well, if what doesn't fit?  The hat now because there's a lump on the top of your skull.  Oh, wow.  If that doesn't fit, you must remove it.  All right. 
[01:44:30]  Getting back to the Michael Jackson thing.  Let's go to Randy in New York.  Randy, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Anthony, you said before that the prosecution lacked a load of evidence.  Actually, they lacked a load as evidence.  Yeah, well, that would have worked, too.  Just like the Clinton thing.  They had nothing on them until they found that load.  You've got to find the load.  You've got to scrape that mashed potato mix off the buttocks.  All right.  Speaking of lawyers here, here's Michael Jackson's lawyer, Larry King, last night.  He discusses the issue of sleeping with children, Anthony. 
[01:45:00]  Well, first of all, Larry, this notion that he sleeps with boys was a concoction by the prosecution.  What he said very openly was that he allows families into his room.  Now, his room is the size of a duplex.  It's two levels.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, lawyer ass.  What he said in an interview that was videotaped that I personally saw, as did millions of other  people, was it's a wonderful thing to share your bed.  With a child.  With a child. 
[01:45:30]  It's beautiful.  It's beautiful.  Exactly.  He talked about how he shared his bed with children.  But this lying fuck will sit there and spew out these lies.  What did Larry say?  Did Larry call him out?  Yeah.  How about going, well, what about this clip?  No, Larry said.  Play the videotape.  I understand you collect keys.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  How did you get started with that hobby?  God, that is it.  Perfect.  That is perfect, Larry King.  You see the new softballs. 
[01:46:00]  Revenge of the Sith.  Yeah, he'll just go off on a left-hand tangent.  What just flew past your head, Larry?  That was a softball arcing at me that I just didn't see.  What did Larry respond?  Maybe Larry had a good response.  All right.  Go back to the tape.  He's had mothers sleep there, fathers sleep there, sisters sleep there, brothers sleep there.  The prosecution concocted this little saying about sleeping with boys because they thought it would turn off the jury, and they failed.  But, yes, we did have to explain who Michael Jackson was to the jury, that he's a very creative spirit, a very gentle soul, a brilliant musician, a brilliant choreographer, and a very sensitive person who is very concerned about the world and the problems in the world. 
[01:46:30]  And he has a very childlike spirit and essence to him, and he attracts children all over the world.  We did have to explain who he was, but this is a country which prides itself on diversity, on the freedom to be who you are.  Jump in there, Larry.  And he never diverted our attention from who Michael was.  We never tried to make him look like anything but himself.  He never tried to dress differently for the courtroom. 
[01:47:00]  Our whole intention was to show who Michael is and be proud of it and embrace it.  Hell, the lawyer's brilliant.  He answered the question, made Michael look good, and just kept going on.  And then had a monologue about how great Michael Jackson is.  Diversity.  Diversity in his country.  Larry.  That's Larry's responsibility.  Somebody nudge Larry.  You know what's diverse?  Those Kellogg's snack packs.  I love how diverse.  You could go from Special K right to Frosted Flakes.  That's diversity.  We'll be back after this.  You friggin' idiot.  Ask him a question. 
[01:47:30]  Larry King is a bum.  He's a bum.  Larry King is a bum.  What a maroon.  Ask a question.  Confront this guy.  Challenge him.  That's why Larry King is so famous, because everybody wants to be interviewed by this no-tough-question-asking  mox.  He is an absolute mouthpiece for whoever's on trial.  That's all you are, Larry, is a mirror for them to say what they want to say.  Country Diversity, Michael Jackson, is one of his members. 
[01:48:00]  You know, I know Sandy Koufax.  What?  Right, exactly.  Well, what about the Martin Bashir thing, where Michael said he likes to share his bed,  Mark?  Yeah.  Why didn't Larry jump in?  It's your show, you suspenders-wearing jizzbucket.  Jump in.  You know what?  I don't care.  Do you take garlic?  I love garlic.  Available at drugstores around the country.  Garlic is wonderful.  That's right.  It'll take the smell of small boy duty off your helmet. 
[01:48:30]  Larry King should have a stroke on his wedding day.  On his next wedding day.  Absolutely.  Married eight, nine times.  Oh, that is funny, man.  You guys nailed it.  Nothing.  He's got no balls.  God, what a coward and a non-journalist.  Confront the guy.  Challenge him.  You ever see 60 Minutes, they get in there with a pencil, and you just, you're like you're  getting fucked in the ass, beating the hell out of him.  Yeah.  Let's go to another clip.  I was going to blow this off.  What were your real intentions for curing AIDS?  What?  I'm a good guy here. 
[01:49:00]  Yes.  I hear there were ulterior motives.  Why didn't I?  I just came up with a cure.  That's all I want to talk about.  All right.  Here's them talking about, well, them.  It's going to be the lawyer talking about media pundits, Anthony.  I think that we have developed an industry of would-be experts who are not professional,  who are not experienced, who are very amateurish in their comments about what's going on in  courtrooms.  Is he talking about us?  Thursday, Carol Channing!  Is he talking about us? 
[01:49:30]  Wait, who did these clips?  Is there any Larry questions?  Who did the clips?  Is this edited?  Did you edit out all of Larry King's questions?  I want to hear some of Larry's questions.  I want Larry's questions.  I want them answered immediately.  That's right.  Yeah, we might have to revisit this.  I'm in the force to ask, you idiots.  Let's go back to the media pundits thing.  And who are willing to give opinions when they're not even there.  And I think it has become the theater of the absurd.  And I think it reached its lowest level in this case.  Speaking of theater, have you seen Billy Joel's musical? 
[01:50:00]  The obvious lowest among people like Court TV, who I felt was really an arm of the prosecution  through this case.  It was very amateurish and very unprofessional and very disturbing.  And that's Sneddon and his Ben hairdo.  He goes to Ben's barber.  It's a guy with a comb on the end of a baseball bat.  That guy is up for lawsuits now, which is kind of good to see a lawyer be willing, because  he's just a bum, too.  He deserves to lose his credibility.  A bum.  The applicant is a bum. 
[01:50:30]  That's right.  Drummed out of the prosecution business.  How long have you known the applicant?  Too long.  The applicant is a bum.  Is a bum.  Don't make me laugh.  What did she say?  Those were for you, Ralph.  What was it that Norton was doing?  Furniture for the anniversary.  Yeah, for the anniversary.  You're going to buy furniture for Ralph.  You didn't see the new Honeymooners, right, Adam?  No.  What do you think of that?  As a huge...  Adam is as big a Honeymooners fan as I am. 
[01:51:00]  What do you think of that?  I'd like to withhold my decision until I see it, and then I'll vomit.  More jobs?  Yeah.  You don't want to burn any bridges, do you?  Burn any bridges.  No.  I don't.  I think it's going to be awful.  It looked horrible.  It looked like it wasn't even the Honeymooners.  It might as well.  Just call it something else.  Well, the reviews were awful, and it bombed at the box office.  It did?  Did it bomb?  Oh, yeah.  Horribly.  No one went to see it, which was like $8 million on his first weekend.  Except for Roger Eber, who thought it was fucking apparently...  Of course he did.  He came off like it was the in-laws.  Of course he did.  I got the Ebert review we could go over in a second. 
[01:51:30]  They re-did that.  His wife called him.  Of course they did, dude.  They're awful.  They butchered the hell out of the in-laws?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The in-laws, one of the greatest comedies ever.  It's like, what are you doing even remaking that thing?  Oh, you have audio of Ebert's review?  Yeah, we're going to do that next.  Okay, cool.  And that movie sat on the shelves for years and they finally released it.  The latest, yeah, the remake.  Good for Gene Wilder walking out of Hollywood because he said they're just so...  Wait, what is the Willy Wonka movie?  Yeah, but he's got some stupid lines, too.  What was he saying about the new Willy Wonka movie that's coming out? 
[01:52:00]  He goes, I don't like it.  The whole motivation here is just money.  That's right.  Yeah.  He's like, all right, and when you made the original one, what did you do it for?  Corn?  What did you do it for?  No.  For money.  What did they make the movie for?  We call it Maze.  To make money.  Maze.  I know what he's saying, though.  I do know what he's saying.  Why?  He's saying that there's no integrity with that.  It's almost like doctors are in the business to make money.  I mean, and they make a lot of it.  Everyone.  Everyone that does anything is in the business to get some type of reward from it. 
[01:52:30]  There's nothing wrong with making money, but it's like they're almost like stealing to make money.  And to me, there's something wrong with that.  Selling drugs is to make money.  I don't think it's all or nothing as far as remaking movies goes.  I think if you take a movie that was made a while back and do a very good job with it and remake it, I think that's fine.  I see no problem with that.  I don't see it as, my God, can't you come up with anything original?  I think Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka is pretty cool.  I'll go see it.  I think it's going to be great.  It looks great.  That seems like a pretty good idea. 
[01:53:00]  Planet of the Apes was awful, that remake.  It was done horribly.  Remember how excited we were when we came out there?  Oh, my God.  That was one movie we were excited we were remaking.  One of my favorite movies of all time was the original Planet of the Apes, and then they remade it, and it just stunk.  Bow your head!  It was awful.  It was horrible.  An ending that I wanted to bang my head against the sidewalk when I walked out of the movie theater.  Oh, no.  But, yes.  Yes, I did.  I wanted to do that.  I was so angry.  But the original.  The original.  And I was still living in Brooklyn when I saw it, so the audience I watched it with looked like what was up on the screen. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Anthony.  Except they were more civil on the screen.  And better actors.  Brooklyn movie theater.  Wait, Jesus Christ.  Why is Dr. Zayas talking on his cell phone?  I'm trying to hear this.  All right.  Dr. Zayas brought his kids to the movie.  Jesus.  Blowing horns.  On horseback coming down the aisle.  Yeah, remakes.  I'm not saying they're wrong.  I agree with you.  What's a good one? 
[01:54:00]  But I think G. Wilder has a...  What was a good remake?  What was a good remake?  Yeah, that's a good question.  That's a really good question.  Wow.  There you go.  This doesn't qualify as a remake, but what did you think?  Let's open up the phones.  Ladies and gentlemen, what's the good remake?  Columbus, Ohio.  Let us know.  King Kong was a good remake.  No, no.  From the original, I'm saying.  Wow.  Because you got a better living ape.  I won't buy that.  No.  I think the new one, the Peter Jackson one, will probably be pretty cool looking.  Yeah, Peter Jackson, Lord of the Rings.  He's making the new King Kong.  Okay. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Dawn of the Dead.  That was a good one.  But was that really a remake?  Was it?  It was kind of Night of the Living Dead, and then they did Dawn of the Dead.  They kind of changed it up a little bit.  I don't know if that's really a remake.  They're doing Citizen Kane with all black cast.  They are actually remaking that, called We Sell Cocaine.  I know that was a really corny, long way to walk that.  Get the little extension so you can reach that.  Yeah, I know.  That was far to go.  And believe me, I know Oaks holding a pen, but one finger should certainly have been hitting  that cricket button. 
[01:55:00]  That was atrocious.  I deserve it.  It was atrocious.  It is past.  The cricket does off.  I'll do this one instead.  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame.  That really did stink.  All right, listen.  Let's get past the Larry King clubs.  We've got two more quick ones.  The lawyer for Michael Jackson talking about the issue of celebrity justice.  I'll tell you what celebrity injustice was in this case.  It was sending 70 sheriffs to raid Michael Jackson's home in a search.  It was putting more experts, more sheriffs, and more investigators on this case than they 
[01:55:30]  do with serial killers.  That's what I call celebrity injustice.  So in a sense, he's correct.  He just is looking at it the wrong way.  Michael Jackson was treated differently because he was a celebrity.  Way to go, Larry.  Does.  And then I'll fuck over you.  Does.  Can you be a fucking man for one second and go, excuse me, wait, wait, wait, okay, hold  on.  Yeah.  Can you for once interrupt the lawyer?  Interrupt him.  Watch Hardball.  That's how you do a show. 
[01:56:00]  You jump in and just interrupt the guy.  Scream at him.  Call him an ass.  Or just go, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.  Before you finish that thought, can you at least once cut him off so you can go back  and get your question answered?  Don't let him just profess his love for Michael Jackson.  You bum.  What celebrity justice?  I'll tell you what celebrity injustice is.  I didn't ask you that.  Yeah.  What celebrity justice?  All right.  When you're going to make a cake, what you have to do.  They're telling.  Does.  They're telling me that Larry King actually has a good question in this next one.  He does.  Talking about race issue. 
[01:56:30]  There were some Jackson supporters concerned over the fact there was no black on the jury,  but composite of that community, of course, there was a black alternate.  Were you concerned about the race issue?  Well, certainly, Michael Jackson is part of a very prominent African-American family,  and initially we did hope there would be some African-American representation on the jury.  But once the jury was picked, I always had a good feeling about this jury.  I always felt they were very independent-minded.  Nobody was going to intimidate them. 
[01:57:00]  They were going to take their job very seriously and be very fair, and I was correct.  No, you weren't.  The fact that Dwayne Reed, the babbling idiots they were when they showed up.  Now that they said not guilty.  Yeah.  If they would have said guilty, it would have been...  There wasn't one black on the jury.  Guaranteed.  This lawyer, if they would have come back and said guilty, this lawyer would have been,  well, the jury is racist.  I knew it.  There should have been more African-Americans on this jury.  That Mark, what's his name?  Garagos.  Garagos is a smooth-talking son of a bitch. 
[01:57:30]  All right, we got one more here.  Waltz is listening.  One more.  I only work with Michael Jackson.  He's my only client.  One more here.  You like jurors who take notes?  Oh, Larry King.  Do you like...  Could someone...  You know what?  Do you like Haagen-Dazs?  I do.  It's so creamy.  Nathaniel's running back to the office good.  This is the bit today.  Because they just quickly got the clips for us for the show, but you've got to get all  the Larry King questions. 
[01:58:00]  He stinks.  This is awful.  Do you like jurors that take notes?  No, I prefer a juror who dozes off, you ass.  Listen to this again.  Do you like jurors who take notes?  I don't know how to answer that, Larry.  I think note-taking is an indication that someone's paying attention and very concerned  about their job, but on the other hand, you can also be paying attention and absorbing  what's going on without taking notes.  So I don't really know how to answer that question.  I see you're writing, Larry.  What are you doing right now?  Look at that.  Here's the church.  I'm just doodling. 
[01:58:30]  Do you like doodling?  He can't believe what a dumb...  This is a lawyer for Michael Jackson.  He can't believe what an awful question he's just going to ask.  He was just asked an awful question.  Do I ask why Michael said he sleeps with boys on the Martin Bashir video?  No.  No.  Do you like jurors who take notes?  Yeah.  Do you like ice cream, Doc?  Why can't he go into room 237? 
[01:59:00]  Who is he trying to bring into this situation?  A cook?  You know, if you could drive a car, you could drive a snowcat.  I didn't know that.  Hello, is anybody home?  We'll be back after these words.  It's KDK-12 to KDK-1.  Do you have garlic?  Delbert Grady, Thursday.  I've got to tear down the third wall because I get a lot of email on this.  Do yourself a favor and watch The Shining if you want to be a fan of this show. 
[01:59:30]  All right, Anthony, Jimmy, Adam Farrar, we've got some jokes that Leno and Letterman did on the Michael Jackson case.  Oh, there you go.  Some quick jokes.  Let's see who did a better job.  We like to do this from time to time.  Here's Leno first.  Well, it's over.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Now Michael's going back to being just another regular guy.  Watch the game.  Have a brewski.  Yeah.  Not bad, right, Dave?  I tell you, he's like, you know something?  If he had been a black guy, he would have got convicted like that. 
[02:00:00]  You know, I just...  Come on, let's be on our society, our society, please.  Beautiful.  A racial joke.  Did you get the opening joke he did that night, too?  Well, we fucked up on the taping, so we only have three Leno jokes.  There was one more opening joke.  What was the opening joke?  I forget, but it was very...  It was good.  Oh, the good news is he got acquitted.  The bad news is he's going to Disneyland.  Pedophile joke right off the bat.  And then the racial joke, a pedophile and a racial joke, right in the monologue.  Yeah.  You know, I was wondering.  How does this make Martha Stewart feel? 
[02:00:30]  O.J. goes free.  Robert Blake walks.  Michael Jackson, not killing.  She made a phone call.  Hello, this is my broker.  Prison!  She's in prison.  One phone call.  That's good.  What did Dave do?  Well, let's listen to what Dave did.  Well, the verdict is in.  Michael Jackson is not guilty.  Not guilty.  However, however, is plastic surgeon guilty on all counts? 
[02:01:00]  Wow, go for the plastic surgeon angle.  Yeah.  Oh, you have Leno's jokes in there?  Ooh.  I want to hear more of what the hip New York guy did.  Do you have that top ten?  Do you have that top ten?  Oh, we get it.  You love Leno.  We get it.  No, but I like that.  That's what you should be doing.  Our new friend, Jay Leno.  That's what you should be doing.  Go after the...  If I never did Leno before again, I would still be saying this.  Go right after the...  All right, let's give Letterman a chance here.  You're right.  A couple more.  You're right.  After the verdict was handed down, the press were talking to the jurors, interviewing the 
[02:01:30]  jury, and one juror said that Michael's innocence was as plain as the nose on his face.  Oh, boy.  There you go.  Another thing.  Don't mention pedophilia at all.  I might mention it.  He might.  He very well might.  He might.  He might.  He might.  Don't kid yourself.  The Michael Jackson trial was a huge, huge Hollywood event.  The verdict was read by Liv Tyler and Colin Farrell.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that's really a hip New York joke.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:02:00]  By the way, one funny thing Leno did, too, that night was he said that Michael Jackson  was met by...  There was footage of Michael coming back in with all those big SUVs taking him home.  So they showed news footage.  And he goes, yeah.  And Jay goes, yeah.  And his staff ran down to meet him.  And they showed this stock Hollywood footage of a bunch of, like, white children in little  shorts running down a hill.  There was, like, 30 children tralloping down a hill to meet him.  So right...  He was standing on to meet him.  Damn, that's funny.  It was...  There's got to be that on the video.  It's hilarious. 
[02:02:30]  That's funny.  But what do you do?  A plastic...  Two plastic surgeon jokes.  A plastic surgeon joke, a nose joke, and a Hollywood celebrity joke.  I'm trying to help Letterman out here.  Let's go to the next joke he did.  But, you know, legal experts thought maybe the jury was near a verdict because earlier  in the day, the jury had asked the judge if they could see O.J.'s glove.  You know, you'd be surprised.  Michael Jackson, the whole ordeal, actually had his supporters. 
[02:03:00]  That's true.  You find it hard to believe.  Michael Jackson actually had supporters.  In fact, even if he had been convicted, the chimp said that he'd wait for him.  Of course that he would wait for him.  A monkey joke?  Of course a chimp joke.  Plastic surgery, a chimp.  Hollywood.  Yeah, all safe.  All safe.  Nothing real.  After the verdict was handed down, Michael said that he was thankful that he put his  faith in the California legal system and a jury of 12 dumbasses.  Oh, there you go.  Way to kind of say you thought he was guilty. 
[02:03:30]  That's it?  Yeah, that's it.  I'm starting to see it Jimmy's way.  Absolutely.  A racial joke?  If Michael was black, he would have been convicted.  A racial joke?  And that video of those kids running down saying this was his staff.  Because you know, it's obviously 1965 footage of shirtless boys.  Right after him he goes.  Right after him.  That's great stuff.  But, you know, until people shake this stupid image of who's hipper.  Look, I'm not saying Letterman's not a funny guy, but he does not do anything edgy.  No.  And it bugs me. 
[02:04:00]  And he used to be the edgy guy.  When Carson, and Carson I always thought was the greatest, and Letterman would admit that  Carson's the greatest.  I would know that you thought Carson was the greatest from your blog.  I did.  Your blog entry.  He was Americana.  A part of Americana.  And I'm a jizzbuckana.  You guys, I got to take a break.  I have so much urine in me, I'm shaking.  Urine makes you shake?  Yeah, it's cooling down my sister or something.  Cool.  I don't know what's going on.  Radiator's full.  I got it, like, just...  Overflowing.  Oh, my God. 
[02:04:30]  What is that?  We've been going an hour and a half.  You want to play a brand new wow song as we go to break on this final?  Oh, that's risky.  This is very risky.  We didn't even hear this thing.  All right, who did this?  Um, right here.  Pears.  Oh, Larry King.  Who did it, really?  I'm still laughing.  Gotta give him credit.  Surgeon guilty on all counts.  Well, here it is.  The wow song by...  Oh, that's hysterical stuff.  Yeah, really way to stick with the issue.  Way to really cut to the meat of it.  Although, last...  Do you have the top ten list?  What he did for...  He did Michael Jackson's top ten. 
[02:05:00]  There was something he said about...  Oh, that's right.  Your sham wife, which was very funny.  It was the top ten, I think, messages left on his...  On his answering machine.  On his answering machine.  I didn't see, but Opie's shaking.  I've only come back from break, because Opie and I are going to go tinkle, do a little helmet  banging.  We'll be back after these words from Welch's Grape Juice.  Welch's Grape Juice.  It's an antioxidant.  Do you have oxidants?  Antioxidant.  I had an unco-oxidant.  He lost his wife, so I ran out of antioxidant.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right, here we go. 
[02:05:30]  At least I did it in a voice, asshole.  It wasn't me.  It was the character.  It was Larry King.  All right.  Anthony left the room.  I didn't count where you were going with that until you said Anthony.  And I'm like, auntie, and I'm like, ah, ah, oof.  And then I try to do it again to reiterate that it was auntie.  Thanks.  Oh, Larry from Monaki.  Ah, ah, ah.  Does Michael have all his toes? 
[02:06:00]  That's what I want to know.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  What did the kids say is...  Oh, my God.  I'm just walking out.  Yeah, let's do it.  All right.  Hit it.  Well, here it is.  We don't even know if this is good.  Hawk is telling us to play it.  It's a brand-new wow song by a guy named Half Man Wonder.  Thank God it's Wednesday.  Let's check this out.  I've got to tell you that was a good one.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow. 
[02:06:30]  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  So the traffic's got me fuming.  Have you been drinking?  Oh, nay, you're on the dial.  Oh, they've got me finking.  Hello, cutie pie.  Cutie pie.  Virgin.  Brand-new shadow.  She looks over at my gremlin and I'm a winking.  Are you a woman?  I take out my golden sister.  And I hope the battle's cancer.  What up?  Get me.  Thank God it's Wednesday. 
[02:07:00]  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  A's, B's, B's, B's.  Doesn't matter humanly.  I can play a child.  Look at my heart.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Got a t-shirt.  That's good.  With three letters.  Whip-a-mow.  When it works,  but those of the day 
[02:07:30]  just got much better.  Sweet mother of God.  Look at me.  Come on.  Right now.  I'm on TV.  That is a very immature attitude,  young man.  Sabotaging the fat guy  doing the weather.  Ow.  Broker.  I'd like to lead  him to the camp.  The special day  was made for man.  Yeah.  We see your stuff.  Whip-a-mow.  Only a frickin' fool.  Doesn't matter if you lack.  Whip-a-mow, 
[02:08:00]  it's your your right.  Guess how many  poop-takes are you?  Whip-a-mow.  Woo-hoo.  Excuse me.  Whip-a-mow.  You live seriously.  Whip-a-mow.  Think your lane is gonna pass.  Russell's puppy's on the glass.  All right, I'm very jolly.  Whip-a-mow.  You could do it on the freeway.  Whip-a-mow.  Even better with a PJ.  Whip-a-mow.  Take your nipple rocket's my way.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Okay, terrific.  Whip-a-mow.  Hey, everybody.  Whip-a-mow. 
[02:08:30]  Whip-a-mow.  Just gonna think that there's a  huge thing ever.  It's a huge tough.  Whip-a-mow.  You could do it on a Monday.  Whip-a-mow.  You could do it on a Tuesday.  Whip-a-mow.  All right, we're on a Wednesday.  Whip-a-mow.  Wow.  I don't know that the town has to open it.  What?  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucks ass.  Whip-a-mow.  And Indonesia.  XM 202.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow. 
[02:09:00]  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  Whip-a-mow.  How was the wow song?  Let me tell you about the wow song as we went to break.  I didn't hear it.  Well, let's start with Jason in Virginia.  Go ahead, Jason.  Speak for everybody.  I want that CD destroyed.  I got to hear it.  I have not heard it.  We really did not hear it before we played it on the air.  We took that chance because Hawk... 
[02:09:30]  Oh, throw me under the bus.  Well, throw you under the bus.  Hold on.  Did you say it was good or no?  You pointed and said play this.  I had a note from you last week.  Remind me to play this on Wednesday.  Okay, so that's what I was doing.  I'd never heard the song.  Have you heard it?  You are gay.  End of last week.  Dude, I can't even read all of the bad reviews of that song that's on Instant Feedback.  It's Bob Kelly on vocals.  The song is cock and it's longer than Stairway to Heaven.  The song blows.  Gayest song ever.  That song fucking sucked. 
[02:10:00]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  This is gay.  There's a whole page.  It needs to be destroyed, Oak.  Hold on.  Eric, had you heard it?  You heard the song.  I never heard the song.  Did you hear it?  You know, I heard it when you reviewed it one morning last week.  I did not review it.  Now, you heard the song.  I had a note written down that said, Opie said to remind me.  How do you know I reviewed it?  You told me to remind you on Wednesday.  Care.  You said you heard it when I reviewed it.  Yeah, just to say you heard the song and you kind of liked it.  I've never heard the song.  So what you're saying is you never heard the song? 
[02:10:30]  Yes or no, Eric?  Did you hear the song?  I heard it in here.  What'd you think of it?  You heard it when I was playing it?  You were reviewing it.  You told me to write a note to remind you to play it on Wednesday.  What'd you think of it?  It's terrible.  It's a pop-up thing.  Oh, my God.  What, Ben?  Ben finds something amusing.  He said it was great.  How do you feel about songwriters that use pens?  Did he say it was great?  Wait, when did he say it was great?  Do you like Carole King?  When did he say it was great?  When did he say it was great?  When? 
[02:11:00]  He just did.  On the air?  I don't know.  It might have been off there.  I've never heard...  Let me...  Maybe he needs more sleep on a tux mattress.  Here's the wow song.  Let's take a listen.  Let's take a listen.  All right.  Eric, don't lie ever again.  I'm not lying.  I've never heard this song. 
[02:11:30]  What is this?  So for you to say that you heard it while I was reviewing it is...  You're lying.  I've never heard this song in my life.  I never heard it.  I would have thrown myself under the bus.  Trust me.  I never heard this song.  So for you to say you heard it while I was reviewing it is completely false.  Did Hawk say it was good?  Because someone's saying he did.  Do we have audio?  Let's go back a couple of minutes.  Because if Eric didn't, I'm going to apologize.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Of course.  What?  We can actually listen a couple of minutes ago?  Of course we can.  This is XM Satellite Radio.  He knew what we want. 
[02:12:00]  He showed me an old note that says, Whip Him Out song, pop punk band.  That's great.  It might have been a song that could have worked, but I'd never heard it.  I'm telling you, I've never heard this song.  I have no problem throwing myself under the bus.  If it turned out I heard the song, then I would have said something, and then everyone  would have jumped on me and laughed and blah, blah, blah.  That's the show.  That's what we do.  I've never heard that song in my life.  He's got the clip.  Let's hear the clip.  Go ahead, Derek.  I haven't found it yet.  Oh, you've got to find it.  Yeah, I've got to go back and get it real quick.  All right.  We'll go ahead and find that clip. 
[02:12:30]  Ben's big hog is in that little room, taking it out of the area.  The song starts off okay.  It has potential.  This part.  The car horn.  It's like whatever.  So far.  Kind of party-like.  Little Andrew W.K.  And then this.  Ow.  Have you been drinking?  Hello, cutie pie. 
[02:13:00]  Virgin.  Oh.  Are you a woman?  A lot of work went into it, but I'll tell you, my friend.  It's a little gay.  The production is great.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Well, there you have it.  It's a cool song if you're doing a Zoo Crew thing.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like some wacky thing.  But this show makes fun of dead children.  This is not the show for a wacky song.  A lot of production.  A lot of the chorus isn't bad.  The whip-em-out part.  But the vocals are a lot.  Yeah.  On the just.  Hold that golden sticker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put it in a glory hole. 
[02:14:00]  You got it yet, Derek?  We might be tossing Eric under the bus for no reason.  I thought Eric said that it was a good song, but I could be incorrect as well.  I'd never heard that song.  I'll tell you that much.  Oh, my God.  Stop the computer.  I want to pop this thing up again.  Thank you.  All right.  Quick reminder.  Tomorrow, Anthony, you and I at RCS Experience in New York City.  We're doing a rare public appearance tomorrow.  Oh, 56th and Madison.  We're going to be there at noon tomorrow.  Tons of stuff to give away.  I mention this because this is pretty cool. 
[02:14:30]  Anyone who signs up for XM gets Yankee or Mets tickets and a free roadie, too, with the  purchase of any XM receiver.  You're doing a live appearance at 56th and Madison?  56th and Madison tomorrow.  You've got to travel a block, and I've got to go to Columbus, Ohio tomorrow?  Are you going to Columbus?  Yeah, I'm in Columbus.  What's Jake?  The Funny Bone.  Funny Bone in Columbus with Adam Farrar.  Where are you going to be, James?  What are you going to give us the number for the Funny Bone in Columbus?  Derek is giving us a sign that he's found it.  Hold on.  I've got to give us the Funny Bone number.  972-404-8501.  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  That's the Addison Improv in Dallas, where I will be. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, you stink.  I apologize, Adam.  My bad.  Tomorrow, Friday, Saturday only.  Plug Stomper.  That's why I can't do the appearance with the boys.  You're breaking the Radio 101 rule.  We're confusing everybody.  Yes.  Poor.  Addison Improv.  One thought at a time.  Now people are going to go to Columbus to see Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, you can tell me.  Farrar fans are going to be a block away from here.  We broke the rule.  56th and Columbus, Opie and Anthony, and you can catch Adam and myself together at the Addison Improv, 
[02:15:30]  June 16th, 18th, 972-404-8501.  If you go to the Columbus Funny Bone, you'll see me and Ellen in a special appearance by  Jim Morton at the Columbus Funny Bone.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony doing a live appearance tomorrow in Columbus, Ohio at the Funny Bone.  Springsteen is going to be at the Columbus Funny Bone.  You've got to go to Columbus Circle?  What?  You sign up for your XM, you get Yankee or Mets tickets.  If you sign up for Sirius, you get a hand truck.  What did you find there, Derek?  Oh, Derek's got the clip.  All right.  Let's hear.  Well, here it is. 
[02:16:00]  We don't even know if this is good.  Hawk is telling us to play it.  It's a brand new wow song by a guy named Half Man Wonder.  I didn't circle it, Adam.  Is that it?  I don't want me to remind you to play that.  Hawk is telling us to play it?  See, he's still trying to throw me under the bus.  Like, what do I do, Anthony?  I circle stuff I want to play, right?  Uh-huh.  Where it says, thank God it's Wednesday, the song.  What do you see?  No circle or line through it.  That's because I haven't reviewed it yet.  Right.  That's how I do things.  Now try the glove on.  So as you try to prove that I knew about it, you're fucking yourself even more. 
[02:16:30]  Stop.  Take your beating.  I have a whole system.  If I don't circle it, that means I'm not playing it.  I don't know what it's about yet.  Wow.  Eric does not take the abuse very well.  Yeah, you get upset, Eric.  I notice he gets upset.  He kind of just puts his hand in his head.  You do a good job, Eric.  Relax.  You've got to learn how to take a beating, though.  That's right.  You push the song.  It stunk.  Like any good wife.  You've got to learn how to take that beating when you're wrong.  You know what it is?  You never had it as a kid.  Go to my house.  Tell my father you want to be a comic. 
[02:17:00]  Just go through that for a while.  Big Joe.  Don't worry about it, Eric.  Jesus.  Yeah, so what?  You thought that Wow song was apparently, you know, something that Pryor should have  done in 1978.  Yeah.  We all thought it stunk.  Whip him out!  Whip him out!  Whip him out!  Whip him out!  And I thank you now because it gave us five, ten minutes of good radio.  That's what's important, Hawk.  That's what it's about.  All right.  We've got the Honeymooners review from Ebert.  Ooh.  Ebert reviewing movies.  Nowadays, he's giving everything a thumbs up. 
[02:17:30]  He really is.  I see it all the time in the paper, like movies that should not be getting thumbs up.  He's giving thumbs up to everything.  So, and, well, this is what he had to say about the Honeymooners.  That's a much better idea.  Ralph and Alice Crandon live downstairs, and Ed and Trixie Norton live upstairs.  They're neighbors once again in the Honeymooners, inspired by the classic Jackie Gleason TV series.  Now, I was afraid this was going to be another one of those lifeless TV retreads, but the surprise...  That's exactly what it was.  I think that's what it is.  Good way that he mentions the racial angle, too, you stupid coward. 
[02:18:00]  Well, his wife is a black woman.  I know that, so he can't be honest.  Yeah, I think she has a lot of say over what he reviews and how he reviews it.  Me and Jim Norton are going to do Cooley High.  Cooley High?  Absolutely.  I'm the best, and I'll shoot you.  There'll be previews at the Columbus Funny Bone this week coming up.  Do you have a number for that, sweetie?  Damn, I don't.  You should have one.  I know you're more prepared.  I certainly am.  We're screwing it all up, man.  It's all right, though.  All right, back to the review.  Those lifeless TV retreads, but the surprise is this is a delightful comedy. 
[02:18:30]  Cedric the Entertainer and Mike Yeps are both Gleason and Art Carney without imitating them,  and those were Gabriel Union and Regina Hall as Alice and Trixie.  In a story where Rob gets rich quick schemes in danger, Alice's dream of a home of their own.  He had a drink.  Let's do this review.  Hey.  The Brooklyn Youth Program is a program to keep young little brothers like ourselves  off the street from stealing hubcaps and breaking in your house while you're not at home. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  Ralph and Ed find a homeless greyhound in a dumpster and get the bright idea of entering him in a dog race.  John Leguizamo is allegedly an expert dog trainer.  The problem is neither the dog nor the trainer knows the first thing about racing.  Oh, shoot.  Oh, my God.  Does this just sound awful?  You know how Sneddon just lost all credibility as a prosecutor?  This asshole should lose all credibility as a legitimate critic. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  How has he given this a good review for many years?  You are a bum, and you're allowing your home life to interfere with your professional life.  You stink.  His wife won't let him give bad reviews to movies starring black actors.  Just won't let him.  Yeah, this is a delightful little thing.  Yeah, I had a drink.  This piece of shit, but I gotta go home to her.  That's how he talks every week now.  Yeah.  I haven't watched him in years, and I saw him the other day.  I couldn't believe it was the same guy.  Sounds like Siskel. 
[02:20:00]  I'm really just laying here, and there are tubes in my arm.  Medication is making me see things.  Is Jackie Gleason black?  He stinks.  He's from Garlique.  It's really difficult to explain to people what I do for a living.  Boom.  This is Cedric the Entertainer's best performance.  Not imitating Gleason, but creating his own, Ralph Cramden.  The supporting cast makes a big contribution, including Carol Woods as Alice's battle axe mother, 
[02:20:30]  and Leguizamo as the flim-flam man, who says,  I started with nothing, and I still have most of it left.  I really like this movie.  Well, I'm sure we saw the same movie, because we were in the screening room together,  so I can't say did we see that.  I hear Ebert going, come on.  Come on, come on.  Because he knows the movie stinks, and he's like, can you help me out here?  Now he's going to throw him under the bus, because it stunk.  Let me go back, because you hear him just going, come on, a couple times, 
[02:21:00]  because he knows.  He knows it's awful.  I really like this movie.  Well, I'm sure we saw the same movie, because we were in the screening room together,  so I can't say did we see the same movie, because I know we did,  but I'm giving this a thumbs down, Roger.  I think you're being far too kind.  I like the cast.  They're very talented.  They're very funny.  They have a dreadful script to work with.  The get-rich-quick schemes are dopey.  And this Greyhound story, I mean, they spend so much time at the Greyhound track, 
[02:21:30]  and it's so silly and so stupid.  I would have liked to see a lot more stuff in that apartment,  in the two apartments, and the bi-play between the two of them.  Instead, we spend all this time in the sewer system,  and all this time at the dog track,  and it gets away from what really would have made this a good film,  and that's the interplay between the two best friends.  Oh, come on.  The fact is, Ralph Cramden always was getting involved in some kind of get-rich-quick scheme,  and if you say it doesn't make any sense, of course.  It doesn't make any sense, because his schemes never made any sense.  But they were creatively inept. 
[02:22:00]  These are just dumb and not funny.  I think finding a dog in a dumpster and racing him at the track is kind of creatively inept.  That's not a scheme.  Because you're drunk.  That's a plot of ice falling in a dumpster in front of him.  I also love the train that they buy.  Oh, yeah.  That's 60 feet below street level, and they don't have any way to get it up.  I mean, this is kind of like the idealization of what the Honeymooners' basic thing was about,  which is Ralph desperately trying, in a goofy way, to impress Alice.  Well, he spends a lot of time driving that bus around like it's his personal limo as well. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, yeah, he does.  Okay, we'll be back to recap this week's show.  Bravo for smashing.  Good, at least the guy told him.  You really are a grovelly, and both of them should be shot for not mentioning the racial angle  and the obsession that Hollywood has with taking black people and putting them in old white roles.  And I'm not saying that it's just annoying that they're doing it just to make some money  without coming up with creative ideas.  It's not necessarily a racial slam.  It's just the lack of creativity in Hollywood.  Well, next year, you know what we can look forward to?  The lack of creativity.  Of course, but they don't mention that. 
[02:23:00]  God forbid he should mention, why do we have an all-black cast doing it?  For what?  Yeah, why?  Why?  You don't need it.  And it stinks.  Maybe, look, I didn't see the movie, so I can't trash it.  But just the groveling way he's reviewing it makes me physically ill.  There are some times I don't need to see a movie to just know.  I've seen enough of the trailer.  The trailer nowadays shows you all you need to know.  Here's what we have to look forward to next year.  A remake starring Cedric in the starring role that was originated by Rodney Dangerfield, 
[02:23:30]  Back to School.  Remember Back to School?  Another great movie.  Which was hysterical, Sam Kinison playing the professor in that one.  It was hysterical.  Burt Young, Sally Kellerman, and Back to School.  Rodney Dangerfield, brilliant in that movie.  Yeah, Cedric is now going to just start remaking white people's role.  Because he's a safe black guy.  He's not dirty.  White people love him because he's safe and fun.  Cedric is funny. 
[02:24:00]  He doesn't need to do this shit.  Why is he taking these roles?  Like Barbershop.  I like that.  I thought it was funny.  It made me laugh.  There was great dialogue in it.  Of course they caught a lot of shit because he said something.  The character said something about Rosa Parks that wasn't good.  Right.  But he was just playing this cranky old ass.  Yeah.  That was a funny movie.  Why aren't you just doing stuff like that?  Because you're trying to capture the black audience by having black people in it  and the white audience by making familiar roles.  Why is this fucking Ebert not mentioning this? 
[02:24:30]  You're groveling.  Afraid of his wife.  Pussy whipped worm.  Afraid of his wife.  Can we get him on the phone?  Do you know where we can get him interviewed?  Ask him the tough questions.  I'd love to.  I can't wait.  We got that guy.  What do you think of?  I understand you bake.  Anthony, rewinding just a bit here.  Eric, if you weren't an entertainer, what would your name be?  Cedric the deli worker?  Oh, yeah.  We'll do that in a second.  Thanks, Eric.  I got a note from Derek.  There's a new sweeper honoring our own Eric. 
[02:25:00]  There is.  As Eric gives the finger to the food.  I've heard all kinds of rumors that there have been things like this in the past.  Little sweepers that honor Eric, and Eric deletes them from the system.  Is that true?  I've heard this.  It's not.  No?  No, it's not.  I'm not saying it is true.  I'm saying I've heard this.  And I prefaced it as saying it was a rumor.  You have never deleted anything that was a sweeper that had maybe content that might have been yours. 
[02:25:30]  No, there was stuff that was moved because there was a time we couldn't play certain things.  Ah, Steve C. is in here now.  This is where I heard the rumor.  That's right.  From our own Steve C.  You're going to hear it perfectly clearly.  Yes.  Steve, if you would take the mic for a minute.  And this is face smashing.  I've heard that Eric took a few things off of Dillette that were supposed to be played because they goofed on him a bit.  Here comes Ben.  When it's not about Ben.  Oh, Ben loves it.  Ben runs in all giggling. 
[02:26:00]  Sends his hog in for recon first to see what's going on.  Then his hog goes back and tells him.  There were definitely a few production pieces that were made where we were making fun of Eric that mysteriously vanished.  Ah.  We did it.  Okay, mysteriously vanished.  There we go.  We don't keep an eye on him all day, so I don't really know, but it's awfully...  But Eric spends a lot of time with this Dillette system, so...  How's that barrel fitting on you today there, Eric?  A little tight?  Especially by Steve, who has the cut-off sleeves and is still sweating profusely. 
[02:26:30]  How do you still have a sweat stain where you cut the hole out of your...  It is so unbearably hot in that studio that I'm in.  It is...  Jesus.  There's no air conditioning in there, so I'm just sweating like...  Yeah.  So yeah, sweepers would vanish.  Production pieces would vanish.  Wear a shirt with snow on it.  Maybe that would cool you off of it.  Maybe.  Now, what's a sweeper that vanished?  Give us an example.  There was, for a while, the one where it starts off, and now, let's listen in on an Opie  and Anthony show prep meeting, and then there was some people moaning, and then Anthony pipes 
[02:27:00]  in with, stop ruining the show, Eric.  Right.  That one vanished for a while.  Uh-huh.  Eric's saying, no, it didn't.  I gotta defend Eric.  Why would he delete that?  I don't know.  But we couldn't...  You know, but I don't know if it was vanished or being reorganized.  There was the other one where Eric was reading a passage from Rent Boys that vanished for  a while.  Ooh.  Well, I took that home with me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That one up and walked away for a while.  So I made sure I put that one down.  Where are they, Hawk?  Uh-oh. 
[02:27:30]  Where have I got him?  Aw.  Aw.  He's not happy.  I have the Rent Boy one, if you want to hear it.  Yeah, let's hear that.  It's a little bit explicit, so...  Yeah, but...  That's okay.  All right.  Pull over and yank him out, fellas.  So, uh, some say that this disappeared for a while.  Yes.  Right here.  Let's take a listen to it.  The Opie and Anthony show presents True Confessions, filled with honesty, compassion,  and understanding.  Today, young Eric admits his love for hot, juicy man-meat. 
[02:28:00]  I flipped on the news when I got home, but I couldn't concentrate.  I kept thinking of Jason, his washboard belly, his tightly clipped dick, his beautiful  chest, his succulent, rosy nipples, his pale, smooth ass.  Next thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees and my shirt pulled up to my armpits.  My nuts dropped down between my outspread legs, nestling warm and heavy against my sweaty  asshole.  I took a long pull on my dick, envisioning Jason's ruddy lips nuzzling against the glistening 
[02:28:30]  sticky crown.  As I continued to jack off, I fantasized about burying my face in his crack, tonguing the  funky treasure hidden between your crooked ass cheeks.  I forgot how vulgar that was.  Stay tuned for another edition of True Confessions.  I envision Jason squatting over me.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  That's just funny, man.  That's a great one.  So yeah, that went up and left for a while. 
[02:29:00]  How did that bit never come back, by the way?  That was a pretty funny bit, occasionally punishing someone with that.  It was just deeply disturbing for everyone involved.  That's the beauty of it.  The listeners, the person that had a read.  All right, well, we have a brand new sweeper about Eric, huh?  All right, let's debut this on the O&A program.  Unpredictable, unleashed, unruly.  Unwashed, unkempt.  I stink.  Next thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees and my shirt pulled up to my armpits. 
[02:29:30]  Shut up!  No, who cares?  I can't believe you fell for that again.  Damn you, Hawk.  Pretty good.  I tried to tame it down.  I didn't want to put too much explicit stuff in there.  But a little disco with Eric is...  All right, very good.  All right.  Where are we going next?  We did the honeymooners thing, right?  Ramon, bring me some antiperspirant.  Jesus Christ.  Would you back over a child five minutes ago? 
[02:30:00]  Blast him with that.  He's trying to pull ribbons and blood off his bumper before his wife gets home.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I have to get his shovel in a small box.  I don't want to go to jail.  All right.  Wow.  We should play the Phil Jackson audio on the Shaq audio.  Phil Jackson, no surprise, re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.  What?  I know.  It's NBA talk. 
[02:30:30]  No.  I'm just a little beat.  A little exhausted.  I just have to get this off my chest quickly.  The news has gotten me scared shitless.  And because of it, I can't sleep.  I'm serious.  Last night, I probably got the least sleep that I have gotten since we started working here.  It's total sleepless nights now for a couple of nights because the news has me all wound up.  Newsday.  Spike in home invasions feared. 
[02:31:00]  Seems a Massapeco couple out on Long Island and their son were awoken early Monday morning by two armed robbers  who locked them in the bathroom and ran away with their cash and jewelry.  Nassau police said.  Nassau County, Long Island.  The incident put the number of home invasions in Nassau to 17 so far this year.  More than twice the number that occurred in all of 2004.  Now, it's only 17, but they have me all scared because they said the home invasions, two patterns of home invasions. 
[02:31:30]  One in the five towns area of Long Island.  The other in Old Westbury, Lake Success vicinity.  I live in Lake Success.  I should.  So they're telling, they said that late at night they enter the homes through an open window or an unlocked door, something like that.  I don't think they've been breaking anything.  And tying people up, locking them in a room, and robbing them. 
[02:32:00]  So now I hear this on the news, I punch it up on the website, and I'm like, all right, it happens, whatever.  So I try to go to sleep, and every little creak I hear now, every little, maybe a little acorn falling off a tree and hitting the roof or something, I'm up.  I'm up, freaked out, waiting for some animal to come in my room.  Do you have a good alarm system?  I'm just scared, waiting for, first of all, I wouldn't say on the air if I have an alarm system or not. 
[02:32:30]  Okay, I'm sure you do.  I have a great alarm system in that house.  I would get like that Indiana Jones big ball that rolls out when they move the statue head.  That's what we mean.  Ann's already got that in his pants.  It's just, you know, they scare the crap out of me.  Because now I can't sleep, because every sound I hear, I think, is somebody breaking into the house.  An alarm is great, you know.  Someone decides to throw something through your sliding glass window, run in for a big hit and run like that. 
[02:33:00]  What are you going to do, you know?  So now I can't sleep.  I'm serious.  I cannot sleep now.  I was up every hour last night.  Here's what you do, dude.  What do I do?  You've got the advanced alarm system, which will wake you.  And you guys sleep in one area of the house.  And I know a guy in porn who does this.  This might sound crazy.  Get yourself a gun.  Yeah.  Get a gun.  Keep it in your room.  And if anybody breaks in, you pull your pistol out, man.  You're going to, because the alarm will alert you that they're there. 
[02:33:30]  There's no way they're going to get anywhere near your room.  Before I can pull out the heat.  Before you can pull out your pistol, man.  Lay down some lead.  Absolutely.  You pull out a pistol, get night vision goggles.  As crazy as that sounds, why not?  Shut the lights out.  Put on the night vision.  I'd rather swing like a Mossberg, just in case there's a couple of them.  I don't want to have to be good with a single shot.  Get a shotgun.  That's what I mean.  Get a nice Mossberg riot gun.  I'd say you get a panic room.  I'm loving the idea of a panic room where just metal slides down in front of the doors 
[02:34:00]  and windows of my bedroom, and I'm just in there going,  I don't care what you take.  It's all insured.  Go ahead.  You want to get me?  Okay, look.  I'll open the door for like a second, and then I'll shut it again.  Here we go.  No, I'm not going to open the door, idiot.  I'm in here.  You can't get me.  Where's the DVD?  Where's the DVD player?  N-word, N-word, N-word. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, no, you didn't.  N-word, N-word.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Just, oh, please don't steal the mezuzahs from the door.  What's the mezuzah?  Petrified.  Get a gun.  Yeah, how are you going to solve this problem?  I am going to get a Mossberg pump shotgun.  There you go.  And keep it.  Because you know what I have right now?  The only weapon I have besides my bed right now.  No.  I have a rapier. 
[02:35:00]  I have a sword.  It's not even real.  It's probably one of your online ones, you mo.  No, it's a very good...  Hold on, you.  Put on your wizard hat with the stars on it.  I'm going to cast a spell.  Look, I've rooted him.  He cannot move.  I'm at level 70, and he's still kicking me in the balls and duct-taping me.  This isn't right.  What level are you?  I didn't see your character available when I signed on.  Level 357. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, I see.  No, I have a sword.  I have a sward.  What is it called?  It's a rapier.  It's a thin blade.  A rapier?  Like a fencing sword, but it's bigger than a fencing sword.  It's a heavier blade.  But, you know, what am I going to do with that?  You don't bring a sword to a gunfight?  Everyone knows that.  Maybe you and Kevin the faggot can go LARPing around your bedroom as fucking ten yams to  your couch.  Put on your big boots and your mask. 
[02:36:00]  Don't worry, I'm almost there.  I'm almost there.  I'm going to come kick your ass.  It traipsed around there in a...  On guard.  Oh.  Like an idiot.  Avast.  Have a...  Get a shotgun.  Leave these premises.  Avast.  Lest I run ye through.  What a faggot.  Where do you taste my steel, homin' vader?  Yeah, I'm going to get in a sword fight.  I'm Errol fucking Flynn.  He'll tie you to the radiator with the fucking thing that closes your robe.  Your wizard robe.  Oh, Christ. 
[02:36:30]  You try to look like a wizard.  Instead, you look like you're in dog day afternoon.  I don't know what's going on here.  Aren't you crazy people they are?  Oh, what a mess.  Here's a guy that took care of the situation.  James in Texas.  Go ahead, James.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Two years ago, my dad and I were in our house.  We're a typical Texas family.  We got about 50 guns laying around.  It's Texas, of course.  It was then about 6 a.m., and my dad had a shotgun, I had my pistol, and we kind of caught 
[02:37:00]  him in the act, and one guy tried to make a break for it.  They're still inside the house.  In Texas, you're allowed to shoot if they're inside the house and you feel a quote-unquote  threat.  Yeah.  So he blasted one guy right in the back with a shotgun.  He made it out to the front yard and collapsed, and the cops finally showed up.  Nice.  I can see if that's a perfect example of a deterrent system.  Absolutely.  That is a deterrent.  My father, out in California, years ago, some guy was trying to break into his work shed 
[02:37:30]  out back, and he went out back, and he used to have this friggin' .357 Magnum that was  just ridiculous.  I remember shooting it as a kid, and you might as well have just lit an M80 in your hand and  held it.  That's what it felt like.  Just you'd feel this thing explode.  And he went outside, and I love how, in his inimitable style, how he told the story.  Because it was a black gentleman.  Although he didn't quite use those words.  I called him a fella.  You should have seen this big hand. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, brother.  He was scared shitless, laid down on the ground, and he held him there and called the cops.  And they arrested him.  So he didn't shoot him.  But it was always fun like that around my house.  Ah, some big man was trying to break into my shed.  Oof.  Held him there at gunpoint.  A fine example of a home invasion, which was almost stopped, was Richard Ramirez, the  Night Stalker.  Oh, yeah.  Was obviously committing murders and barbaric rapes.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:38:30]  Breaks into this couple's house.  He shoots the husband on the couch.  He runs in to get the wife.  They're old people.  Yeah.  She has a shotgun under the bed.  She pulls it out and points it at him.  Hey, I remember this.  And he's stopped in his tracks.  And she fucking pulls the trigger.  Click.  Click.  Click.  Their grandchildren had come that week, so they had unloaded the gun.  Unloaded the gun.  Oh.  Click.  So he then proceeds to kill her.  Now, this dummy should have just pointed the gun at him and made him leave.  Right.  And I'm sure he would have left.  You don't question a shotgun. 
[02:39:00]  Some hard language.  You get out of here.  Get the hell out.  I don't care how much you think Satan's on your side.  Get the hell out of here.  I don't care how many bad-teethed Puerto Ricans with their pants tucked into their socks break  into my house.  They, uh, yeah, well, you know something?  She should have pointed the shotgun at him, but she wanted to kill him.  Yeah, she thought it was loaded.  She was assuming it was loaded.  Probably surprised the shit out of her when it just went click.  Do you know the sound, how horrible that must be when he stops and you hear click,  and then he comes towards you and you hear another click, and you're like, oh, no. 
[02:39:30]  And then he has a nice big smile on his face.  They're dead.  They're dead.  Hey, guys, I've got to interrupt this.  Mary Carey's here, and she's got to leave in a few minutes.  Okay, let's get him.  All right, bring her in.  She made the news, uh, having dinner with the president, I guess.  Really?  Wow.  She was in the same room.  I mean, it's one of those dinners.  Let's be honest.  It was a whole invasion.  She broke into the White House.  She broke in?  She was in the back.  There was Bush with his rapier?  I'm sure she was at the back table.  Here's the weapons.  Don't move.  Give me a piece of gum, Hawk.  I'll run you through.  I'll check if we had better seats at the Donald Trump roast. 
[02:40:00]  You think?  Let's put it that way, yeah.  Thanks, Hawk.  Mary, we had no idea you had to leave right away.  I'm sorry.  No, I didn't know.  I didn't know.  Someone's suggesting I should slap the home theater, uh, home theater,  home invader across the face with a huge leather glove  and carve a script A into his fat farm gear with my rapier  and then challenge the perp to a duel.  Pistols at 20 paces, sir.  I am an ass. 
[02:40:30]  I have archaic weaponry.  Yeah, I'll hit him with a catapult.  You hear a crash.  You're tying your mask on.  Could you please go out 500 yards so I can hit you with my trebuchet?  I'm awful.  I understand you have one of those things that Davy slew Goliath with.  Yes, I could spin it around and hit him in the head.  Jesus.  Why don't I get some up-to-date weaponry?  A sword.  Mary Karrion.  Hi. 
[02:41:00]  There she is.  I know, I'm sober this time.  You're all alone.  I know, and I miss her.  You know what, but I've kind of been distancing myself from her  because I find it to be dangerous hanging out with her  because it gets to the point where she's falling down in the clubs or, you know.  Yeah.  Talking about the time that she brought to, what was it?  Tony Roberts.  Yeah, Tony Roberts.  Yeah, yeah.  I love her, but.  And we had her crying like crazy.  Yeah, she's crying.  Or actually, Anthony had her crying.  I was just saying that she looked a little intoxicated when she was in.  She took it personally.  I admit, I'm drunk, but she always, she does it a lot.  We have fights all the time. 
[02:41:30]  You know what, to make it up to her, tell her I want to.  She doesn't remember who you guys are.  That's the best thing of it.  I want to buy her a trip to Aruba.  I'd like to book her a holiday inn in Aruba.  She doesn't even remember the radio show.  I told her I was coming, and she doesn't remember.  Really?  Yeah.  That doesn't surprise me at all.  God damn, you mean we could have fucked her?  Yeah, probably.  She's so funny.  So you went to this Republican fundraiser?  Yeah.  One more time.  I think this is funny, too. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  So I told her I'm going to be the president, and she goes, I love Bill Clinton.  Oh my God, she thought he was still president.  Yeah.  Nice buzz.  Yeah, we both do.  That is really stupid.  She actually got me drinking last week.  Yeah, okay.  So I went to President Bush.  You did.  So I didn't really get the music.  Now this was kind of a.  They actually, they kept me far away from it.  Now this was a big news story.  We had read it in the news that you showing up at this thing, and some people were a little  upset about this, saying that, you know, a porn star should not be at one of these presidential 
[02:42:30]  dinners.  Did any of these people that didn't like you approach you or talk to you?  I had one religious woman, towards the end of the night, who came over to me and goes,  I don't know what it is, but God's got a plan for you.  I'm not sure what, but God likes you.  Yeah.  There's hope in your life.  And she started going on and on.  Yeah.  Suck that cock.  No, I guess earlier she went over to my, I had a little handler, like the first day,  the first.  Can we back up though?  Why were you invited?  The owner of my porn company donates money to them, I guess.  There you go.  And he got a thing in the mail. 
[02:43:00]  Isn't that great?  Why would he though?  The Republicans are going after porn.  Well, he did it once because they sent him a thing in the mail saying they would put  his name in the Wall Street Journal if he gave $400.  So he just did it just to be funny, you know, like.  And so they invited him to this and said, for $2,500 a person, you can go to this.  And so he did.  And I met, I met some really perverted old Republican men.  Of course.  Yeah, they all, they're all perverted.  Yeah.  One of them, like, their sister owns strip clubs.  They're going to book me at their strip clubs.  Another one offered me money for him to do stuff with his son. 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  Which one offered you money?  I don't want to say his name.  Why not?  Ah, go ahead.  You can say it.  It'll be fine.  He's just, like, a rich Republican guy.  Like, he's not, like, a congressman or anything.  But he did tell me his parties for the congressman that I can go to and I can get some girls together  and they'd pay us well.  Did he offer you a lot of money?  Did you do it?  That's the key.  No, no.  Why?  Why?  Because, you know, his son's, well, it was with his sons, too.  He was really gross, this guy.  Really?  And then his sons were gross.  Is he known?  Would you know? 
[02:44:00]  I don't know.  I mean, I didn't know.  I guess he, he told me he owns David Copperfield or whatever.  He's like.  What?  He's like, he's going to put David Copperfield, like, on tour and stuff.  Oh, really?  Is David Copperfield's manager or something?  I guess he owns, I don't know, some company.  I can show you guys his card later.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Let's see it.  Any politicians come up to you and say anything?  The only person I thought was really cool that I met was a guy from the NRCC when I got there.  This little guy in the seat gives up to me and told me he's going to follow me everywhere  I go.  And they have to make sure that I don't go up to congressmen.  And if I do, because we were going to try to get pictures, hoping that. 
[02:44:30]  They don't want pictures with a porn star and a congressman for, you know, it'll show  up on a re-election commercial.  Yeah.  Do you want to elect this man?  You know, and they'll show a picture of you shaking hands.  And even this guy then, there's like, we started hanging out and then he was afraid to go out  with me after the thing ended because his boss was saying you can't be seen hanging out  at other bars because you can jeopardize your credibility and your career.  And so I was kind of insulted by that, you know?  Well, you've got to understand.  These people are, you know, they can't even be seen a little bit interested in you and 
[02:45:00]  what you do.  Yeah, and he was getting in trouble, too, because we were like talking the whole time.  He was cute, you know?  Did you see Bush?  Yeah, I did see him.  Yeah, he was kind of far.  They gave me, like I said, they put me at a table because I guess when I found out on the  inside what they thought, they were having meetings thinking I was going to like streak.  Or run up and flash him.  Yeah, that would be great.  And they were like, they had people plan to like, this guy, that was cute, Ed, he was  supposed to tackle me and jump on me.  Secret Service snipers.  Yeah, they were supposed to, they had people watch me at all times.  Like, the second I'd show up, you know, they'd be watching me, they'd report where I'd go. 
[02:45:30]  What'd you wear?  I actually wore a very conservative long black dress because I wanted to like fit in and  then I got to look at my nail, so.  Nice.  Red, white, and blue.  I thought I was so creative.  I was really, I don't know.  I really liked the name.  That was cool.  When I came up with it, I was so excited.  I'm sure it's creative.  And did they put you as far away from the president as is humanly possible in the same  room?  You're at the kid's table.  Yeah.  I could have been like one, two, there was like five tables more away I could have been,  but I was pretty far away.  Pretty far away, but you were able to see him? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I could see him as far away.  I could see him on the big screen.  Yeah.  I was having fun talking to my NRCC guy.  He was hot.  I wanted to have sex with him, but.  NRCC?  He was in the National Republican Congressional Committee.  I just learned with that man the other day.  I actually like Republicans now.  They were like, they were fun.  Yeah.  You know, all of them get really, really drunk.  Oh, at the end of the night though, when I was in my hotel, they were all like, just  you know, coming up to me and, you know.  In your hotel?  Yeah.  Open the door, we'll name a bill after you.  Yeah, they were, you know, I was nervous, like I said about religious people, but it's 
[02:46:30]  mostly the businessmen that go to this because it's tax reform, you know?  Yeah, and businessmen are a bunch of perverted bastards.  And towards the end of the night, you know, and the best was, one of the women, this woman  comes up to me, said that her boss is a congressman and he wanted my autograph.  But I didn't want to send an autograph for a congressman because I didn't want to, I  don't know, they would somehow blame me for something.  So I'm like, I can't do that.  So I signed it to her and she's going to give it to him.  Big fan congressman.  I took lots of photos with people.  The girls, some of the girls didn't like me as much, you know?  Of course not.  Well, of course not.  A lot of stuffy Republican wives and stuff.  Yeah, I get in the elevator and I heard one go, ugh. 
[02:47:00]  Ugh, really?  Actually an ugh.  Ugh.  That's great.  But the guys were all waving at me, but then, you know, some of the girls loved me.  Some of the girls thought it was hilarious or they're like, oh, then yesterday night  one guy considered me at the bar and it was like, one in the morning he goes, you see  that girl in the black dress?  She wants to lick your tits.  I was like, what?  Whoa.  I was like, that's my wife.  And another guy told me that we should have a threesome with them.  It was Bessie?  Yeah.  I was just surprised, like I said, because I thought they were conservative, but no.  And they drink as much as Tawny, some of them, so. 
[02:47:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I would have loved to have heard that.  They're known as being real uptight, but they're thinking, in their head, they are  more perverted than anybody.  But like the NRCC people in charge, they were very uptight.  Like people running the event.  Yeah.  But I guess it's because they live there and they are involved in politics.  And I was really disappointed.  I was trying to really convince, you know, the guy that I like to come.  He's so, and I told him if he didn't come out with me, I wanted him to watch a basketball  game with me.  So I kept trying to leave the event to go watch a basketball game.  And he was afraid to, and then I was like, if you don't go with me, I'm going to say 
[02:48:00]  your name all over the newspapers.  Because some of the newspapers, and I guess you're asking who's the guy that you're talking  about during your press conference.  Because he's a little kid, yeah.  He's so cute.  So he's going to come visit me in LA.  Did you bang him?  I would.  You would?  No problem, right?  Did you bang anyone that night?  No, I haven't had sex in like two days.  Oh.  I know how you feel.  It's my birthday today.  It's my birthday.  It is?  And I want birthday cock.  Ah, she wants birthday cock.  You can't take birthday cake.  How old are you? 
[02:48:30]  Where's Ben?  25.  Cut her off a slice of birthday cock.  I'm getting old.  I mean, who else?  He's got plenty.  I'm going to be a piece of birthday.  Nobody knows.  I took a train here at three in the morning.  He just got in.  And I met a guy who just got out of Iraq.  And he was sitting like right behind me.  And the person, he didn't know who I was because he's been out of the country for like a year.  But the guy next to him was like, oh, it's Mary Carey.  She's a porn star.  So I was like, oh, come and sit.  And he's 22.  He's so cute.  And he hadn't seen like, he's a girl just with hair laid down.  Turns him on.  So I like, I sat with him and I slept on his lap.  And he's big fans of you guys.  He's like, where are you guys going? 
[02:49:00]  And I'm like, up in the end.  And he's like, I've been fans of him for years back when, was it like Connecticut?  Were you guys in Connecticut?  Okay, he's fans of you guys.  Connecticut, Boston.  Oh.  Same thing.  Well, I don't know your history.  Like, this guy was like telling me your guys' history.  And he wanted to come so bad and see you guys and meet you.  But he had to see his family.  Why didn't you sleep with him on the train?  I fell asleep.  Yeah.  I would have told him if I wouldn't have fallen asleep.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  I was telling him to come with me to New York.  I'm like, why don't you just not go?  You could have done him in the bathroom.  No, he's going to try to get here tonight.  This dummy could have banged Mary Carey and he just stayed on the train. 
[02:49:30]  No, no, no, no.  He had to leave to go to Newark to see his family because he's been out of the country for like...  Screw that.  You stay on the train.  I don't feel my boobs.  He's playing with my hair.  I was laying on his lawn.  You stay on the train and you go see your mom later.  She'll be there.  She'll understand.  I think he's going to go.  He's so cute.  But it was crazy to show you pictures of people getting blown up and everything.  That's crazy.  That's what happens over there.  Yeah, it doesn't look like fun over there.  No.  That's why he should have gotten laid.  You're watching the NBA Finals, Mary?  I know you're a big basketball fan.  Yes, Pistons.  Yes.  I want to have sex with a Pistons.  I'll settle for a Spur. 
[02:50:00]  Well, she's had sex with a lot of NBA players.  Actually, one of the players I met a while ago, a Clipper guy, well, he's not Clipper  anymore.  He got cut right after I met him at the game.  He called me this morning.  I hadn't talked to him for a while because I don't know why I just haven't.  He's like, it's hard to understand him sometimes, too.  It's something about he saw me on the news.  I thought he said he's in Florida, but he just said, no, I want to fuck.  Call me.  I saw you on the news.  Do you have that message?  Why is it hard to understand him?  Because a lot of them talk like, really, I don't even know if I can do it like, it was  over this case.  Remember the Clipper game?  Remember the Clipper game? 
[02:50:30]  I'm like, who?  He's like, no, no, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  And I'm like, oh, and they mumble.  I don't even, I wonder if I have any.  How many NBA players have you had sex with?  Be honest.  Give us a number.  Two at least.  I have to go to the teams.  Wow.  She has to go by division.  Wow.  No, my goal is to have one from every team.  You ever have sex with a Piscons?  That's a great goal, though.  I had a couple tips.  Your bench has depth.  No, I really like, my dream player is Ben Wallace.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He would just wreck you, man. 
[02:51:00]  He's like a big monster.  Like, argh.  You know?  He's married, though, but that doesn't stop most of them, so.  Would you drink out of his mule, Ben Wallace?  Does that mean?  Give me oral sex.  Oh, you know, I don't, I don't know.  I don't know.  It might be really big.  I don't know, but I heard that another big player is a small one, so.  Who'd you hear?  He's the biggest guy.  Shaq.  Yeah.  Shaq has a small mule.  Shaq has a little mule.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  It's probably 10 inches, but if you're 7'1", it looks small.  That's true. 
[02:51:30]  No, Ben Wallace is my dream guy, and then I like, what?  Yeah, he's just really hot.  I don't know why.  He's got that whole, like, I don't know.  He would wreck you.  How big did you hear Shaq's is?  You know, I heard him, like, 5 or 6 inches.  I don't know.  This girl.  Little tiny thing.  Reliable.  I know that, you know, she's, yeah, she's probably 7 1⁄2, and it just looks small  on him.  I met her in Denver at the All-Star game.  There's a lot of girls like me out there.  Yeah.  That get flown out by different people that hang out.  I love them.  Screw the players, yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Pink ticket.  Pink ticket.  Pink ticket.  Every girl wants to be.  I know the best was, I'll say the thing, because he's dumb.  Wesley Person, do you guys know who that is?  He was, I don't know, he was on a, he ate now, he's a nugget, and he went out with  me and my friend Jessica James, the other person.  He just, he had no sense.  He was so dumb, and he was like, telling us, if you lose weight and your blood goes, he's  like, when your blood goes to the tubes and it clunks, and my friend Jessica goes, when  it what?  He goes, when it clunks.  And she goes, do you mean clump?  He goes, no, I mean when it clunks. 
[02:52:30]  And he's like, he's making no sense, you know what I mean?  Holy Jesus.  Like, they make no sense, a lot of them.  Yeah, I would assume.  And they smoke a lot of weed, a lot of them.  Yeah?  Yeah, like a lot.  Is that, that's him right there?  He looks, uh.  Kind of scary, he's ugly.  Wow.  I didn't have sex with that one.  He actually ended up leaving me and Jessica.  We brought him to Bill Maher's show.  Bill Maher invited me to the show, I'm like, what?  Of course he did.  So I bring him to the show, and this basketball player is like, I never heard of Bill Maher.  Who Bill Maher?  I'm like, well, Bill Maher.  Who Bill Maher?  Who Bill Maher? 
[02:53:00]  I'm like.  I'm sure Mr. Maher wanted to have sex with you.  Um, yeah, I actually got a message.  I have a Playboy show he watches, and he called me like, I'm in my hot tub, watching Totally  Busted.  Oh, I'm in my hot tub.  Me, Betsy.  Yeah.  You're into this.  Yeah, my friend actually had sex with him now.  Yeah.  He's just too old.  You know what I see?  I can't do the whole, like, have sex with really, like, people I'm not attracted to do  things.  Right.  Yeah.  How about dumpy comics?  You're buying a dumpy comic?  I love to.  I love to.  You're cute.  Oh.  It's like birthday.  I need birthday cock.  Ooh. 
[02:53:30]  Don't even.  I'm not selling for anything right now.  It's been a couple days.  Don't even tempt.  I couldn't believe I couldn't.  Don't even tempt Jimmy.  We got Jimmy or those toys up above if you need.  Actually, my vagina just came out, like, two weeks ago.  It's really cute.  In a toy?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's actually a box.  It's so funny.  It's like, wow, you've been fucking a lot of basketball players, and your vagina fell  out?  What?  I didn't know that was your goal.  I love it.  I love giving it out my vagina.  I love, like, being like, what?  I was like, what?  My vagina came out?  No, I actually took, like, a big black deal to it and stuck it in my vagina. 
[02:54:00]  I was like, oh, what it looks like.  Wait, can I ask?  How do they make your vagina?  I think I saw it on Real Sex once.  But what do they do?  They pour, like.  They actually pour stuff in there, right?  You sit on their legs, like, I can't do it.  And they pour stuff on you.  They just get the outside and kind of the lips and stuff.  Yeah, it's great, because in the box it says full lips, and it says nubby interior.  That's yours right there, huh?  Oh, is it my toy?  Or is it my vagina?  Yeah, that's your toy.  How did you guys find it?  How do we find it?  Everything's on the floor.  The box is great.  It's, like, gives you orgasms. 
[02:54:30]  That thinking only about Mary Kay's tits can hear something.  I just like the nubby interior.  I told the guy I'm kind of seeing to try it out while I'm gone.  Yeah.  Like, go get some.  And he's like, okay.  And I'm like, you're really going to try it out?  Don't try it out.  Do guys really use these things, though?  Or is it more of something just to have, because they're into the, you know, into you?  I think the guys that.  You really think they use it?  It just seems like it would be weird.  I want to try one out.  I've never tried a pocket thing.  I've never tried none of the toys at all this time.  Well, I've seen these dildos, and they suck.  They're definitely not, like, the real thing.  Maybe someone could explain how they use one of these things. 
[02:55:00]  I know.  I love it.  And what a nubby interior.  It's just having the vagina.  It seems weird.  It doesn't sound like bouncing a mountain bike tire.  It looks like a little sleeve that you'd think of.  Yeah, no, I understand.  But you hold on to it.  But does a guy build, like, a pillow woman around it?  Like, what do you do?  You can't just hold the pocket vag and go to town.  It looks like it's got a little thing you hold.  Well, my other one's coming out.  It's actually going to be, like, my butt and everything.  Oh, really?  The whole bottom end and everything?  You should have your guys send me one.  I'll use it and reveal it.  Give it a review.  I'm going to try it out on someone.  Yeah.  Jimmy, we'll try out your vag. 
[02:55:30]  My vag?  No, I really, I don't know.  I'm going to start sending it out to people like basketball players for, like, you know,  presents and stuff.  What do you like, the black cock or the white cock?  I don't really care as long as it's NBA cock.  Just NBA cock, yeah.  That would be black.  No, no.  One of them was white.  I don't know.  One of them.  I don't like them.  Mario Cossoon on the Orlando Magic.  Yeah.  I met him out of the club.  Yeah.  In Orlando.  And I went and sat, like, front row.  All this money with me and Hannah Hartford sat front row at the game. 
[02:56:00]  And we were so drunk.  Like, I don't even remember.  I don't remember half the games, like, oh, it sucks.  Because, like, you know, like, the best was, oh, I went to the Heat and the Pistons game.  I sat in the third row next to Shaq's wife.  And I was so drunk with Tawny.  And Shaq's wife was, like, some people next to me.  And I was screaming and being loud.  And I'm like, some of us are trying to watch the game.  I'm like, Shaq's ugly cunt.  Jeez.  I can't say that word again.  Yeah, you can.  Yeah, you can.  Go ahead.  Shaq's wife?  And I was the one next to her.  And, like, and then I was just, I don't remember the half of the game.  I can't remember from halftime on. 
[02:56:30]  But people who saw me there were, like, you were so into it.  I was jumping around.  And then at the end of the game, Ben Wallace went over to the scores table.  And I went running to the table and stood there and started crying.  Because I couldn't believe I was seeing him up close.  After so much black cock, after sex, do you do a handstand and they practice free throws?  That's a good idea.  That would be like, I would assume they're all large gentlemen.  Yeah, let's see.  Most of them are.  The biggest was the white one, Mario.  Really?  It was like a soda can. 
[02:57:00]  It was so big.  I was so drunk.  It was so good, though.  The size of a soda can.  Because if it actually looked like a soda can, that could be frightening.  A little fat and a little longer.  It was huge.  My friend Hannah had sex with his best friend in the bed next to me.  Oh, yeah?  And she was like, I really didn't want to put in what else to do, Mary.  You know?  That's a good egg.  Yeah.  Wow.  Take one for the team.  Wow, wow, wow.  It was funny.  She got done.  She takes off running out of the room.  It was either check my email downstairs or, ah, what the hell.  I already read the paper.  Yeah, right.  Yeah. 
[02:57:30]  I have a lot of friends like that.  Well, I didn't know what else.  Or the best is, like, my friend Tawny's not really in.  Well, now she's dating a black guy, but she wasn't into him.  And so whenever we'd hang out with groups of NBA players, their friends, they'd all  be up on her, and I knew she was so drunk after she was laying there, I knew she didn't  want to do it with them.  So I'd have to step in, and I'd always be like, cock blocker, cock blocker.  That was my nickname with a lot of the black guys.  She's going out with a black guy now?  Now she is.  She calls him white because he's a lawyer and talks white, but, you know.  But he's a black guy?  I'm so happy.  I mean, I feel like.  Does he mind that she does four or no? 
[02:58:00]  No, I don't think so.  He wants to manage her.  He wants to manage me too.  I think this is someone who wants to take some of our money.  Who can't really do anything for us.  There's a lot of those people out there like, I can manage you.  You're getting ripped off here and here.  Let me take over.  Why can't I meet a girl in the business to date?  I'd be a fine boyfriend.  I'm a nice guy.  Yeah, I'm a good egg.  I think you could, honestly.  Yeah, maybe.  Tawny.  Nah, she's too messed up for me.  She's so funny.  Does she really have to leave?  Well, you know what it is?  I think we have, we're doing, I mean, I don't mind staying.  You guys are fun.  I think I should be permanent on the show. 
[02:58:30]  You actually, you do really good radio, I must say.  I know.  I know, that's what, yeah.  You really do.  I know.  Where are you going now?  I'm on the Daily Show.  Daily Show?  Yeah.  I came off the train, so I don't really have to go wash my hair.  It's kind of nappy, because I was all hairspray.  Well, if you stay, one of us will have sex with you for your birthday.  Really?  Birthday cock?  Yeah.  Can you put a bow on your dick?  I want to open up a wrap for my dick.  That makes sense.  We all have my friends from high school, actually.  They all live up here.  Two of them are in law school.  One's in, works at Smith Barney.  So, it should be fun.  You know what I mean?  Because, like, they're normal girls. 
[02:59:00]  How many guys in high school that, like, probably, that, like, maybe you hooked up  with a guy in high school that can just look at you now on film and go, I used to fucking,  I used to hook up with that.  Well, you know, it's funny.  I get all these emails from them all the time, all the guys from high school.  Really?  Yeah, like, I went to a Pinecrest prep school in Florida.  If you go to Friendster.com, they have, like, a, I thought I just plugged them.  That was nice of me.  If you look at Pinecrest, they have our favorite movies, like, and it's like Mary Carey Rules,  all my movies listed, and, yeah, they're great.  I love all those guys.  Yeah, I think it's unfair, so I tell these guys I dated, they're losers. 
[02:59:30]  It's not really fair now that they get to tell me if they had sex with me.  It makes me mad.  A lot of them will call me, because I haven't changed my number since I was 18.  So, like, I'll get these weird phone calls from guys that knew me then, and it's just...  I'm sorry I pulled your hair.  No, I've got this one who's, like, really weird.  I dated him when I was 16, and I hung out with him last time I was up here.  I'm like, oh, yeah, let's get together, you know?  He seemed normal in the emails.  He's, like, a great job, a lot of money.  He's weird.  He read my diary entries.  He was like, so, Tommy, I read that today you did this, and yesterday you were with Mary here, and I'm like, he knew everything.  Oh, wow, a little weird. 
[03:00:00]  It was creepy, right?  Yeah, and he just kept telling me, like, how he's weird.  We ended up ditching him at a club.  We're like, God, I'm just leaving.  You should get a rapier and keep it in your bedroom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's a rapier?  Short.  They're making all sorts of...  Oh, you guys were talking about that earlier, right?  Yeah, we bring it all right back.  G. Gordon Libby, and he taught us how to kill people with a pencil.  Who?  G. Gordon Libby.  G. Gordon Libby.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The soup guy.  He's the guy that puts the fruit in the can.  He asked me for a password to my website.  That's nothing.  Master Polk could teach you how to kill someone with a piece of paper.  Really?  Yes, he showed us one day.  G. Gordon Libby. 
[03:00:30]  We're upset that you have to leave, though.  They're making gestures like crazy outside the door.  I'm staying.  What's the matter, Steve?  I'm staying.  Yeah.  Hand coffee to the mic.  I'm having fun.  You want to just come back tomorrow?  But they have birthday cock.  And when are you leaving town?  Um, tomorrow at 9.34.  In the morning?  9.54.  But I'm flying first class, so I can go an hour early.  So why don't you leave later?  Come here in the morning real quick.  I'm good.  Yeah, bring him by in the morning.  Can I go in the morning?  The guy with a kick-ass shirt's telling you you have to leave.  He's my boss.  This is the first time I've been sober on here. 
[03:01:00]  Remember, I've been stoned once.  Yeah.  I've been drunk.  Uh-huh.  Now I'm sober.  Tomorrow I should come doing coke.  Yeah.  Smell a little coke buzz.  Nice.  That'd be really funny.  You think I talk fast now.  That's what I was going to say.  No, I'm just naturally like this.  Yeah.  All right.  I thought you were Mark.  You sounded like Mark.  Next time, could you bring us some of Mary's movies?  We're big fans.  What's that one?  Did Jeff hook you up with that?  No.  No.  No.  I love to see you.  That Jeff.  All right, listen.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Mary, Carrie, always a pleasure.  We'll talk to you soon. 
[03:01:30]  When we get back, we're going to talk to Chris and Dougout Doug.  They both have effed a pocket pussy.  Oh.  Because I want to see what you do to, you know, line it up a little bit.  Do you just hold the thing or do you build some kind of woman around it?  Sounds good.  We'll get the answer next.  Boobs always bring this show to a halt.  Oh, screeching halt.  I'm clean.

[03:03:00]  Baby.  Baby.  Yep.  Making me fun for a little bit.  All right.  Let's set the scene here.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  It's Whipple Mouth Wednesday.  Jim Norton, of course.  And Adam Ferrara.  Hello, folks.  Always a pleasure, Adam.  Adam's going to be at the Funny Bone?  In Columbus.  In Columbus.  Ohio.  Starting tomorrow night through the weekend.  Tomorrow through the weekend.  And that's it.  No more plugs.  We've got to help out Adam.  Yeah, that's fine.  Tomorrow through the weekend.  And then we'll talk about Jimmy's plug later.  And I and I are doing something tomorrow.  We'll get it all in before the end of the show. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris.  He effed a pocket pussy.  Ooh.  Chris, what's going on?  Walk us through this.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi.  Jimmy.  Love you on Leno.  Hope you and Anthony Albright.  Adam Ferrara, you're a funny sumbitch.  Thanks, pal.  To the pocket pussy.  I'm a truck driver now, but I used to work on towboats on the barges.  And I was on my way to meet the boat, or maybe on my way back.  I don't remember.  Stopped at an old bookstore like I always do.  And I've been curious about it for a while.  So I got this big thing.  It was probably about six or seven inches long. 
[03:04:00]  Just a big block of latex.  But on the front, it had a, I mean, it wasn't modeled after anybody.  It was just a generic pussy.  And the opening was maybe half the size of a dime.  But it was latex, so it was super stretchy.  And you'd just lube it up.  And I would just kind of hold it like a jack-off sleeve, like a jerk sleeve.  I kind of used it like that.  What would you do besides avoid mirrors where you could catch your own reflection?  Actually, I'd stand in a mirror to enhance it because I'm a show, not a chauvinist,  but an exhibitionist and a voyeur at the same time. 
[03:04:30]  I've got a belly like Jimmy, but I love my, I come close to the Coke Cancock that Mary was  talking about.  More like a Red Bull, but close.  Sure, sure, sure, sure.  Go ahead, go ahead.  But when I would fuck this thing, I don't know what it was about it, but I would come  more and harder and further.  And it was open-hand, so it would shoot out the other end, so you had to be careful of  that.  And I mean, I fucked some hot women. 
[03:05:00]  And, you know, good sex.  I've got, you know, periods of time, you know, like a couple weeks without coming.  I mean, two times in a row I could almost fuck this thing and, like, do a Jimmy shot.  I mean, like, across the room.  I don't know what it was about it.  He loves his little sleeve.  I know, but do...  I don't have it anymore.  Go ahead.  Did you, like, build a woman around it, though, or you just hold the thing?  No, not really, man.  Imagination, a magazine or something, or a movie, if I had to.  It's just like jacking with something else in your hand, is what it is.  So you jack it.  All right.  He's not, like, putting it in the crack of the couch or something and humping it. 
[03:05:30]  I'm thinking you might want to build some kind of form.  Yeah.  Give him time.  All right, Chris, thank you.  Let's go to Doug OutDoug from whackbag.com.  Doug, what's up?  That guy is a non-creative act.  All right, what did you do?  What you've got to do is, in five years of marriage, I went through three of these things.  Because the cunt never wanted to fuck anymore.  Before, I thought, of course, it would be a good idea at the end of the five years to  go ahead and start banging somebody else.  But that's besides the point. 
[03:06:00]  I had a sleeve as my original one.  You don't understand the shame you feel in yourself when you go through the whole process  of putting this thing in between a pillow and folding it in half, taking a belt and strapping  it tight so it stays secure.  Oh, no.  Putting it on, okay?  Here's the good kicker, though, because I like when a girl's on top.  Taking an additional belt and strapping it around my back to the top of the pillow so 
[03:06:30]  it stays secure so I can pump upwards into it.  Wow.  That is a lot of preparation.  And it's not so much preparing it as it is taking it apart.  When you're preparing it, you're all worked up because you're going to be jacking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But once you finish up, now you're stuck in this thing strapped to you.  Yeah, there I am with a belt around my waist.  Hoping that isn't the moment you have that embolism.  Hoping your wife doesn't come home so you have to explain why she won't fuck you. 
[03:07:00]  As you lose sperm, you lose your self-esteem at the same time.  You're like, oh, what the fuck is wrong with me.  Right after you come, oh, God, please just help me.  Please take me now.  I also had another sleeve that was a little thicker that also allowed me to do some good  doggy at times.  I would actually put it between the box spring and the mattress so it would stay secure,  point myself towards the porno video, and start jamming into my mattress.  Doug, why don't you just do something with more dignity, like molest a kid? 
[03:07:30]  Well, I did.  I started seeing somebody else.  But then I had an actual one, like I think Mary Carey has, which is the actual model of  the pussy.  Right.  It looks like you took a knife and just dug it into her belly button and cut all around  to blow her ass all into a little flop of latex.  Yeah.  That was good to just throw on the sink and just look at yourself in the mirror and bang  and pretend that you were banging.  I'm the last thing I want to see when I'm coming. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, you don't want to look at yourself.  You can actually look down into that and really get turned on by the fact that you're actually  watching your dick going in and out of a nice shape, pussy.  Jesus.  Really?  No, I couldn't.  All right, Doug, I'm going to save you.  I'm going to hang up before you admit anything else.  Oh, too late.  Have them ask, Doug, about how his ex-wife claimed he worked for the O&A show during their  child custody hearing, claiming he was an important part of the show, running sticker  stops and creating song parodies. 
[03:08:30]  Uh-oh.  Apparently somebody that she knows has heard me on the show doing stupid shit that I attempt  to do to try to get a laugh at somebody in this country and told her about it.  And right before my trial date, I got a letter from her attorney asking for my wages from  XM Satellite Radio.  Saying that I'm on this show, they've played some of the stuff that I've done, and regularly 
[03:09:00]  my voice is over their airways, and she wanted that to count against my child support wages.  Great.  Don't you love it?  They don't bring up the fact that you were humping furniture.  No.  They can't even have fun on the radio without some broad and her lawyer trying to stick  their fingers in.  Exactly.  I had the same problem during my divorce.  They wanted all kinds of records as far as my radio career and how much money I made.  This isn't even a radio career.  I'd fall in and make an ass of myself for the splendor of you guys. 
[03:09:30]  Exactly.  My girl leaves me, she's going to get six notebooks full of dick jokes and a couple of albums.  That's about it.  Yeah, I got nothing to take either.  I don't want tranny porn.  Well, then you get nothing.  That's it.  You think you got nothing until push comes to shove, and then you realize, oh, I do have  something.  My God.  And now it's gone.  I thought those fillings were mine.  Let's go to Scott.  Don't try to hide it up your ass, because they'll dig in there, too.  Find whatever's up there.  Richard Pryor had a great bit about fucking, you're in court, and your wife is crying,  and the judge was crying. 
[03:10:00]  He goes, oh, nigga, we want everything.  He goes, do you have any dreams?  We want them, too.  Oh, Fryer was crying.  The judges cry.  Yeah.  Oh, the judge started crying.  Oh, that's great.  You know Phil Tagg?  Yeah.  Going through his divorce, he's also turned 40, had to go for the scope test.  Oh.  He calls me because I went for the scope test, and they found something.  I go, what?  My ex-wife's attorney was up my ass.  Still.  All right, you want to hear more about this stuff, Scott? 
[03:10:30]  How to make a prison pussy?  What's up, Scott?  Yeah, O.P. Anthony Adam.  What's up, Big Dick Daddy?  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah, I work in a prison over in Jersey here.  Oh, yeah?  And the inmates make prison pussy.  It's take two rubber gloves, fill them both with water like water balloons, tie the wrists  together, tie the fingers together, and there you go.  Jesus.  A little warm sensation for the evening at lockdown.  Oh, so it's two, it's the palms of two gloves, because the wrists and the fingers are tied 
[03:11:00]  together, and it kind of makes like a, I thought prison pussy was like a new guy  with a goatee.  That's exactly the prison pussy.  Oh, God.  They want to kiss you.  And we heard another story about how to make a prison pussy with a towel and saran wrap  or something.  Hold on, I'm getting a pen.  Go ahead.  You take a towel, and you take saran wrap, and you put the saran wrap in the towel, and  then you roll the towel up real tight and put rubber bands around it, and then kind of  open up the bottom, and now you have a tightly wrapped towel that's lined with saran wrap. 
[03:11:30]  And of course, you leave some of the saran wrap hanging out one side so you can fold it  up over the roll of the towel and then rubber band it, and then you stick it in.  You put some lotion or something in there.  Yeah, you put some lotion in there, whatever.  Give you some goodness.  A little Vaseline intensive care lotion.  Or you could just grind up a chapstick if that's all you have.  Hey, moving on.  There's so much more we didn't cover yet today.  The Shaq clip.  Have you heard the Shaq clip yet, Anthony? 
[03:12:00]  Was that what we listened to earlier?  Mary Carey saying he had a little dick.  Well, Phil Jackson re-signed with the Lakers.  It's a big story as far as the NBA goes.  But it was very obvious he was going to re-sign with the Lakers because he's going out with  the boss's daughter.  Or actually, she even is more in control of the team than her father at this point.  I thought she was dodging him.  But there was speculation he was going everywhere else.  But it was obvious he was going to just re-sign with the Lakers.  What reason did he get for leaving?  I think he was forced out, right? 
[03:12:30]  I think he was forced out.  The stupid Lakers.  How do you lose Shaq for Colby?  Shaq, look, say what you want about Shaq.  The guy has been a dominant player.  He's bad with free throws.  He never gets bad press.  The guy's never a problem in the locker room.  He's never a problem at all.  He's a good guy.  Everybody likes him.  He's a great player.  Why do you let Shaq go?  Well, there was a conflict between Colby and Shaq.  Colby's the younger guy, I guess.  So they're basically saying, well, it's Colby's team.  And Shaq wanted to leave.  So, well, Shaq, because he couldn't stand Colby anymore. 
[03:13:00]  Colby's a selfish asshole.  At one point, they basically said, all right, it's Colby's team, so we've got to make him  happy.  So they got rid of Shaq.  And Colby wasn't into the Phil Jackson as well.  That's how I'm hearing it.  And then, obviously, the Lakers just stunk up the joint this year and lost all.  And Colby lost all his, you know, his power there.  And now they're pretty much telling him, shut up.  This is what's going to happen.  Phil's coming back, right?  He's a selfish baby.  Is that pretty much it, Ben, more or less?  I hate Colby, too.  He's a total dick.  Yeah, I used to be a Laker fan, dude.  I could care less about the Shaq-Colby team. 
[03:13:30]  I like James Worthy and Magic and those guys.  I kind of stopped liking him after Kareem left.  Well, listen to this clip.  They were talking to Shaq, I guess, on ESPN.  And listen to what Shaq had to say.  They basically asked him about Colby.  They played together, obviously, for what?  Four or five years, won three championships, you know.  And they were in the finals a couple more times.  He's a dick.  I mean, Colby's a dick.  He forces the best player out and the best coach.  You know what?  Who is it?  Jerry West?  Yeah.  He's the dummy. 
[03:14:00]  Colby's a great player, but you don't lose Shaq and Phil Jackson for Colby.  I'm sorry.  Well, West moved on.  He's still there, isn't he?  I don't know.  He's with Memphis, I think, or whatever.  Is there a team in Memphis?  Jerry Buss, one of the Busses, Busses?  Yeah, the Memphis...  I have no idea.  Graceland.  Not a clue.  All right, here we go.  Oh, the Memphis die on the toilets.  That's the beauty of this show.  We spew all this stuff as fact half the time.  We don't even know. 
[03:14:30]  We really are idiots.  I really don't know why Phil Jackson's back.  No idea.  I'm just like Colby Morrison out.  That's the beauty of doing a talk show.  It's got to be right.  They're saying it.  Zero accountability on our part.  Oh, yeah.  Colby may have requested him back.  We don't know.  He really missed Phil.  That's what I love about any talk show you listen to.  You're like, how does that guy know?  Oh, the news shows do the same thing we're doing here.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, the pundits, they speculate, and people go, oh, well, did you hear on the news?  Who does? 
[03:15:00]  Who does?  The pundits.  The pundits do.  Yeah.  Cool.  What did I say?  The pundits.  It's not a pundit?  No.  What is it?  It's a pundit.  Pundit?  Pundit with a T.  We all learned something new on this program.  I learned that from G. Gordon Libby.  Let me see.  You're absolutely sure?  Yes.  It's been saying pundit for years.  No, it's not a pundit.  Sorry.  Don't be so defensive about it.  No, I'm not.  No, it isn't.  I can finally be right.  You are right.  Jesus.  Let's all chill down.  What?  Chill down. 
[03:15:30]  What?  Pundit.  What is Dave Douglas doing here?  Ditt.  Pundit.  Good visual for the Boston crew around here.  All right, here we go.  You get it?  I stink.  P-U-N-D-I-T, right?  Yeah, of course.  I would never put it in any way.  I hope I didn't use that word too much in life since I could talk.  You know?  You look at a word and you're like, I've been using that since I think I was maybe eight,  eight years old.  There you go.  Nobody stopped me up till now.  All right, here we go.  Here's what Shaq had to say about Kobe.  Listen to this. 
[03:16:00]  This is why I love Shaq.  I'm so happy.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Listen to this.  Do you ever see the day that it would be possible for you to sit down, have a talk,  with Kobe Bryant?  Who?  Kobe Bryant.  You know what?  I'm not familiar with that name.  I know a lot of names.  I have a lot of names in my head, but I'm not familiar with that name, especially if there's  nothing to talk about.  I'm sorry.  I can't recall that name.  So it sounds like no conversation's coming soon. 
[03:16:30]  I don't know what that is.  Oh, great.  Isn't that awesome?  What a smartass.  Good for him.  And there's the chick reporter.  You know, she's like, oh, no.  He's giving me one of these answers.  He hates Kobe, obviously.  Oh, shit.  You knew, I think it was, maybe I think Colin that raised the point, when he was on Tough  Crowd and Colin was on it, when none of his players would come to his defense, they were  all like, look, we don't know.  I'm sure the facts will come out.  Like, nobody would actually run up and go, Kobe didn't do this when he was accused of 
[03:17:00]  rape.  His teammates were all going, hey, I mean, we'll see what happens in court.  Right.  NBA players were all going, hey, look, let the justice system decide.  They wanted to see him hung.  Oh, man.  He is a selfish, how do you have Shaq hate you?  The guy has one of the best reputations in basketball.  Everybody likes this guy.  And he's a great player.  They went to the finals.  They won three championships.  His free-throwing stinks, but you know what he makes up for?  He's a dominant, dominant player, man.  A dominant player.  Hey, we got the Phil Jackson audio, because there's a clip here. 
[03:17:30]  Clip four.  Jackson was asked if he's talked with Kobe Bryant to mend fences about some critical remarks  he made about the Lakers star in his book.  And Jackson said, who?  Yeah, because Jackson pretty much trashed Kobe in his book, and now he's coaching the Lakers  again.  Let's hear this clip.  I think it's a matter of trust and a matter of rebuilding the trust that we've had.  And yes, I have talked to Kobe, and he called me this morning, congratulated me on the job,  and I felt confident that he's confident that we can go forward. 
[03:18:00]  Kobe has no choice.  He's stunk without Shaq.  Oh, he was awful.  They didn't even make the playoffs.  No, they were terrible.  And I was kind of glad to see it.  That's what happens when you get rid of a guy like Shaq for a fucking prima donna like  that.  Good.  I guess there's no more.  But is anyone watching the NBA Finals?  Does anyone even care?  You're a big basketball fan, Oph.  Have you even watched any of the games?  No, I haven't.  I think the Pistons are up, right?  No.  I can't stand how long the basketball season is.  The Spurs are up?  I swear to God, I would have bet like hundreds of dollars that it was the Pistons. 
[03:18:30]  Spurs are up 2-1.  Detroit won last night.  Oh, okay.  I really don't know.  I haven't watched the game.  Exactly.  Nobody even cares.  If Miami was in it, I think it would have been more excitement.  There's a Shaq.  Oh, yeah.  Just because everyone was happy to see him do good without that baby.  We got a quick clip.  You don't want Detroit winning, though, right?  Isn't that what I like?  Dude, this is going to be fine.  Of course you want Detroit winning.  I mean, from a law enforcement point of view.  Yeah, yeah.  You mean home invasions will happen in Detroit?  Oh, my God.  Oh, please, cops are rooting for Utah every year.  That footage is great every year. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, Detroit.  Yeah.  It's fun when it's not you, you know?  Yeah, that's true.  When you see those cars upside down burning with some animal jumping up and down on top of it.  I can't get enough of that footage.  You can't tell if it's a car or a luggage.  It's all right.  Jesus.  I'm just...  I'm just...  I kept it vague, my God.  Me, too.  Yeah, sure, you did.  Me, too.  I like to take vacations.  I kept what vague?  Exactly.  See how vague I keep it? 
[03:19:30]  Exactly.  I'm just trying to be a pundit about what's going on.  Shut up.  That's the key to radio.  Just keep everything vague, kids.  Just keep it vague.  A quick clip, Anthony.  Vague-y.  I like keeping things vague-y.  A quick clip here.  Virginia Graham.  Anyone know who Virginia Graham is?  Yes, but I don't want to spoil it.  She was a dancer, wasn't she?  Virginia Graham.  She was the son of a cracker mogul?  Virginia Graham.  I think she was one of these... 
[03:20:00]  Well, we know the clip, but she obviously worked with...  Invented a cracker?  She obviously worked with Mike Wallace.  I just did a cracker joke that bombed.  You did?  Yeah, I said she was the daughter of a cracker mogul.  I didn't even listen to you.  That's how badly we listened.  Mike...  Mike...  Mike...  That's a pile-up on the cracker highway.  Mike cracker joke bombed, then he leaped into the cracker pool.  You know what?  That was like, you stuck your head up and got shot, and I just went, what happened? 
[03:20:30]  Shot my head up.  You know...  What an idiot.  I gotta point out, ever since we acknowledged that we don't listen to each other, it makes  listening to the replay so much fucking fun.  I can't wait to hear me bomb with the same cracker joke.  But I might have even said she was the son of a cracker mogul.  Mike might have bombed on every level, but it just got...  Not only did it bomb, nobody acknowledged that a person had spoken.  I wasn't listening to you.  I would have laughed at that, obviously, because I felt enough confidence in the cracker joke 
[03:21:00]  to use it myself.  I will say again, because no one was listening, now that we acknowledge that we're horrendous  listeners here...  I think it makes it more fun to listen to the replays.  That's right, you were listening.  It really is a lot of fun, though.  Wow.  Holy crap.  That is something.  Sometimes I'll listen to the replays and go, why are they playing Best Of?  I don't remember this today.  Yeah, I don't remember this at all.  All right.  It's the way it is, though.  Just idiots who are just like...  That's the way friends are.  You hang out, and you fucking basically acknowledge the other moron until it's your turn to talk. 
[03:21:30]  Right, right, right.  That's the way we lived.  Just nod your head and wait for your...  And stick in your shit.  Yeah.  All right, here's Virginia Graham Anthony.  She worked with Mike Wallace, I guess, as part of the 60 Minutes program, I'm assuming.  And she had to do some kind of feature where she read a letter or something, and she just  starts laughing uncontrollably.  All right.  I love these little inside clips that never air, unfortunately.  Mm-hmm.  Today's beauty expert to Richard Willis.  From Washington, Esther Van Wagoner Tufte, and we'll be listening to the tales and fables 
[03:22:00]  of Helen Hayes.  And now, Virginia Graham answers her mail.  Today's letter is from Miss C.S., and Mrs. C.S. has a problem with her husband.  He hasn't been coming home at night and giving her the marital devotion that she feels is  necessary.  She has lived with him for several years, and she feels that this is an indication of perhaps 
[03:22:30]  a sterility or a desire to have love.  Now, listen, Mike Wallace, you son of a bitch.  You have been doing this oh, too long.  I have got to explain to you, ladies and gentlemen, that he was an impossible person, and he's  been making me laugh out of the air, and I don't, and I have promised that I wouldn't  do it anymore, so...  Virginia, Jim.  Yes.  I'll take care of it.  We're going to take a cutaway now, and then we'll come back in just a moment.  No, I will continue. 
[03:23:00]  And I'll continue talking.  Now, I'm very sorry.  I think maybe we ought to go to music, and I'll come back, and I'll do my last spot like  this.  These are one of the things, you know, where a person gets hysterics on the air, and you'll  just have to...  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts. 
[03:23:30]  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  It's a hot piece of air.  Quite a handful.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result. 
[03:24:00]  The Opium Ancaly Show.  In case you didn't nudge.  All right.  Derek's trying to find that whole cracker thing.  Oh, I know.  It's so goddamn funny when it happens now.  Just, Jimmy says the line, I did not hear a word of it, and I come out with the same 
[03:24:30]  joke, and just fail miserably right behind him.  Jimmy goes, I drive into a ditch, and you drive into a ditch to help me.  Just fall right in it.  Derek's finding the clip, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  Because Jimmy's walking back in here.  Dude, that break's over already.  Awful.  I was looking at, when you said, who's Virginia Graham, the whole process that happens on  this show is, you're thinking of a line.  You're trying to come up with something entertaining and funny.  Graham Cracker.  So I'm thinking, I don't know, every Graham reference came to my head. 
[03:25:00]  Heather Graham, I'm thinking.  Billy Graham.  Something, right.  Trying to think.  And the only reference that really, I thought, could have any comedic value whatsoever was  the Graham Cracker.  The funny little cracker.  The Graham Cracker.  And I was, as I'm thinking of this, I don't hear anything around me.  So that's when Jimmy said his Graham Cracker joke.  All right, at this point, I've got to confess something.  I didn't hear either the Graham Cracker joke, which would have been killer if you came up  with a Graham Cracker joke. 
[03:25:30]  I didn't even, I didn't even hear either one, because I was too busy doing something myself.  I was reading the paper.  Right, I had no idea.  That would be the ultimate.  I'm going to hear this for the first time.  All three of us come up with the same joke, because none of us were listening to each other.  Well, I hate we say the same joke.  How about if one of us had come up with one joke?  How about one joke that was funny?  Instead of a bunch of Graham Cracker obvious statements, the fucking, Jesus Christ, are  we fucking the most obvious?  Graham Cracker!  Horrible.  Hacks.  We're all trying to be on the Tonight Show with Jimmy. 
[03:26:00]  Right.  Yeah, you know how it is.  You're sitting there with Jay, chit-chatting and laughing.  Yeah.  Hobnobbing.  Yeah, two out of four in the studio understand that.  Oh, that's right.  Two out of four.  Oh, wow.  Adam Farr was on, uh, he's done a few Tonight Shows.  How many have you done?  On Jay Leno's Tonight Show as well.  We've done two.  Oh, we've just done two.  Oh.  Looks like it's a race to the third.  Did you see our appearance on Bravo, Adam?  No, you won't.  What Bravo were you on?  Now that's the show.  Oh, we're not going down.  Hold on, come on.  Oh, no, it's okay.  Oh, we have this stuff. 
[03:26:30]  Derek is ready.  Derek is ready.  Sorry.  Let's, um, let's give a listen to the, I want to hear Jimmy's Graham Cracker joke now.  Oh, it's a classic.  Can we back up to the setup and everything?  All right, yeah, I have confidence in Derek.  Roll the tape, Derek.  A quick clip here.  Virginia Graham.  Anyone know who Virginia Graham is?  Yes, but I don't want to spoil it.  She was a dancer, wasn't she?  I was.  Virginia Graham.  She was the son of a cracker mogul?  Virginia Graham.  I think she worked.  No?  I think she was one of these, uh...  The son.  Well, we know the clip, but she obviously worked with... 
[03:27:00]  Invented a cracker?  There it is.  We're back live.  Jesus Christ.  I got the gender wrong.  Eager asshole.  But you know what else is funny?  You was on a cracker mogul.  You were thinking out loud.  You're mumbling.  I like it.  Virginia Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Graham.  Somebody needs a Graham.  I didn't even try to put it in a funny context.  Graham.  Cracker.  What is cracker?  Like, at least Jimmy tried to throw in the word mogul, which is always funny.  You know, the word mogul. 
[03:27:30]  The son of a cracker mogul.  No one, I've made that mistake many times before, even in jokes.  Whoops.  A little gender error.  That's really funny.  Big cracker daddy.  God damn, did we stink right there.  That was an awful moment.  Another thing we could do.  We're stolen because Morgan Spurlock is supposed to be calling the program today.  Anyone know who Morgan Spurlock is?  Ah, let's think.  Like, Morgan Spurlock. 
[03:28:00]  Spurlock.  The daughter of a...  He's the guy that invented a little gizmo that kept the spurs from jingling and jangling.  Spurlock.  The Spurlock.  Everyone knows.  You lock him down.  That's right.  Graham Cracker.  He's the super-sized me guy.  Ah!  Right.  He's got a new show called 30 Days, which sounds like it could be really, really cool.  So we'll talk to him when he calls.  Any minute, it looks like.  But, Anthony, we were talking about the Bernie and Phil commercials in Boston.  That's right, Phil. 
[03:28:30]  Yesterday?  Mm-hmm.  Adam, you know about Bernie and Phil?  No.  Tell me about Bernie and Phil.  Bernie and Phil.  They're up in Boston.  They sell furniture.  It's a furniture store.  And I think every city in this country has their wacky furniture store, people.  We got one down here.  They come on late at night and hawk their furniture and talk about how they've ordered too much  inventory.  We screwed up again.  Yeah.  And all their commercials are wacky.  Well, this is Bernie and Phil.  They're from Boston. 
[03:29:00]  And Bernie is the guy.  Phil is, I guess, Phyllis.  This is his wife.  And they do the commercials together.  They're just two old Boston people.  And Bernie's Boston accent is worse than Mayam and Eno's.  He can't talk like he's normal.  And we've always found it very entertaining.  Yeah, we're trying to find the better commercials.  So far, this is what we've come up with.  So you get the idea.  Listen to this.  We're here at Bernie and Phil to check out the new Berkline Comfort Gallery.  Berkline quality at our comfortable prices. 
[03:29:30]  This one's great for my back, Phil.  Are you happy with the selection?  You have so many great styles and innovations, it's hard to decide.  It's Berkline.  If anyone deserves it, you do.  Let's see how Bernie's liking his chair.  We're going to have to get back to him later.  He's sleeping.  See, that's the joke.  Let's see how Bernie likes his chair.  I love my new couch.  I shove my pocket pussy in between the cushions. 
[03:30:00]  Hey, Bernie, you want me to suck your cock?  Bernie's asleep on the couch.  Put the belt around my ass.  Strap it in.  I queued up the wrong one there, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Who was the English chick?  I don't know.  She's new to the mix.  She's just the announcer.  And then you got the Orbit's gum chick.  Then you got the husband and wife.  Fabulous.  Here's the one where Bernie talks a lot more.  I'm sorry.  32, 33.  Instead of counting sheep.  33. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, was that 34?  Why not visit Bernie and Phil's and count our huge selection of knackers?  Plush, your pedic, strings, and faster.  All at the guaranteed lowest prices around.  Pillow top.  Plush, extra, firm.  Boy, this is making me tired.  Okay.  You've got the idea.  Oh.  34, 35.  Plush, your pedic, strings, and faster. 
[03:31:00]  Pillow top.  Where does that accent come from?  Holy jeez.  He's not using his breath properly.  34.  Hey, Phil.  God damn.  And they're just a couple of old relics, too.  They should not be doing their own commercials.  And they've been doing it for years.  Yeah, that's a...  Phil is just the worst.  That's a bit in progress.  We're going to have to say cut there on that one for now.  Can I ask a question?  This might sound like a little off the subject. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Why is Joel Rifkin in the office?  That's a real visual.  But there's a really creepy-looking fellow around.  I had a visual about that same guy about 20 minutes ago.  What did you say?  That no one heard.  What did you say?  What did you say?  It was for...  Joel Rifkin?  No, it was for the Boston people.  I said, why is Dave Douglas walking through...  Oh, Dave Douglas.  I don't know what Dave Douglas looks like.  I know.  Then I said that's a visual for the Boston people.  Oh.  Morgan!  Hey, guys.  Morgan Spurlock, everyone, from Supersize Me.  Hey, Morgan.  Morgan, we kind of go back a few years with you. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, way back.  We used to do a show called I Bet You Will, right?  That's correct.  And you came in and helped us out.  We had a lot of fun with you back in the day.  We did.  And I got to tell you, then a few years go by, and I went and saw Supersize Me, and I'm  like, how do I know this guy?  It was really freaking me out for a while, and then it finally hit.  But congratulations on the success of that movie.  Well, thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  Saw you at the Oscars, and I'm thinking, my God, that guy was in studio with us.  Hobnobbing.  Hobnobbing.  With celebrities. 
[03:32:30]  Congratulations to you guys, too.  For being...  I'm glad you guys are back.  Yeah, it's about time.  Yeah, man.  We had to take about two years off.  It kind of sucked.  Well, it was good, but we missed you.  I'm glad you're back.  So, I got to start with Supersize Me.  I have to say, I think you were cheating when the cameras were off.  Really?  I think you were cheating.  Cheating how?  I thought, you know, I mean, obviously the concept was great.  You were going to eat McDonald's, nothing but McDonald's, three times a day, you know,  live off McDonald's, McDonald's, McDonald's, and your cholesterol went through the roof. 
[03:33:00]  You gained, what, 30, 40 pounds?  I gained 24 and a half pounds.  24 pounds in a month, and you damaged your liver, and I was thinking, I'm like, you know  what, I mean, obviously the guy's trying to make a point here.  I'm thinking that he's shoving a lot more McDonald's in him when the cameras weren't  rolling.  No, I mean, we shot basically everything I ate, you know, over the course of the course.  Oh, I know, you were eating like a pig.  It was hilarious, but I'm thinking, yeah, sneaking another shake here or there when the  cameras weren't rolling.  Yeah, no, I mean, I was eating, you know, everything, anything I ever bought from there. 
[03:33:30]  You know, it was, anytime I got, anytime I got hungry, breakfast, lunch, dinner, you  know, snacks, desserts, anytime, everything came from McDonald's, so what you saw was  what you got.  Have you eaten it since?  I have not, you know, because I love a good burger, and for me, a good burger just doesn't  come from any of those fast food restaurants.  Yeah.  You gained, like, about 25 pounds after a month, and it took 14 months to lose it?  To get it all off.  You know, the last four and a half pounds, it took me nine months to get off.  Those were like the yo-yo pounds.  Yeah.  You know, where I'd lose one, gain two, lose three, gain four.  It was up and down and up and down. 
[03:34:00]  And I didn't realize until the doctor told me that, you know, when you lose weight,  those fat cells that are in your body, they never go away.  So you're basically screwed with these little skinny fat cells that are just sitting there  waiting to get fat again.  Wow, really?  Yeah, so anytime, you know, so anytime you overeat, you know, those fat cells will just  store the fat right away.  So, I mean, even to this day, I can put on three, four pounds, you know, in a weekend  if I don't think about it.  You got to have them lipoed out or something?  That explains why.  Yeah, you have to get rid of them.  Or, you know, if you stay one weight, you know, for like, I think it's like between  five and seven years is the lifespan of a fat cell. 
[03:34:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Didn't know that.  So you can get them lipoed out?  You can get them sucked out, yeah.  All right, I'll do that.  Oh, Jimmy.  Mmm.  Suck them out.  Go somewhere.  Open up.  And what was the worst thing you ate at McDonald's?  I think I read that in an interview somewhere.  You know, I think it's got to be those terrible little square fish sandwiches, dude.  Just awful, huh?  Oh, the filet of fish.  I don't know where they catch those little square fish, but they're terrible.  They go to pet stores.  How about the, did you get a, I know it's limited, but the McRib? 
[03:35:00]  Remember the McRib?  I mean, the thing is, what you've got to love about the McRib is they just grind up  this pork, this pork mush, and then press it into rib shapes.  Yeah, so it looks like there was a bone in there.  Yeah, because basically those black stripes for the bone are like almost painted on there.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  What would you say the best thing you ate from McDonald's was?  Oh, I mean, the Big Macs are the best.  I mean, to this day, if I smell a Big Mac, my mouth will start watering like Pavlov's dog.  Really?  Yeah.  Fat cells start dancing.  You know what I can't stand?  Those goddamn chicken McNuggets.  Oh, those things are awful. 
[03:35:30]  It's like chicken McCartilage.  Oh, the deep fried pigeon?  Yeah, they'd be like, you bite into it.  You would have to put the whole thing in your mouth because if you bit into it, you were  forced to then look into the bite and see things that were not chicken.  Yeah.  It was like swirls of meat and stuff were going on.  There's nothing organic in there.  Yeah.  Because, again, they just grind it up and squish out these shaped McNugget things and then fry them.  The friend of mine bit into one one time and it basically just like this little white, 
[03:36:00]  almost like pus bubble thing exploded into his mouth and on his face when he bit into it.  Oh, yeah.  And so he was done after that.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, you've got a new show on FX and I like the concept of this.  It's called 30 Days.  Do you want to explain it really fast, you know, what it's about?  Yeah.  The show does a good job of looking at serious issues, things that I think are front page news,  very topical in America today in a way that's entertaining and fun, much like Super Size Me was.  You know, we want to create a show where somebody will kind of walk a mile in someone else's shoes, 
[03:36:30]  kind of see the world through somebody else's eyes.  And on tonight's episode, the premiere, it premieres tonight on FX at 10 o'clock.  My girlfriend, my fiancee actually now, and I moved to Columbus, Ohio,  and we asked the question, what's it like to live on minimum wage in America?  And so for 30 days, she and I moved there and we tried to do what millions of Americans do every day,  which is basically you get a job, try and pay the rent, and just survive.  And you didn't have access to your ATM account or any of that, right?  Nothing. I mean, we got rid of our, we had no credit cards, we had nothing, we went there.  Yeah, but the camera crew's going to help you out a little bit. 
[03:37:00]  I was stuck hitchhiking in the rain one day, so just, you know, totally pissed off I couldn't even tell you.  I'm like, come on, guys, you can give me a ride here.  And they're like, nope, keep walking.  One thing, though, is you know, though, you won't end up homeless, so that desperation isn't there.  Well, I mean, the desperation for us was just to still be able to pay our rent,  because, I mean, with the pay our rent and pay our bills,  over the course of the month, both of us ended up having to go to the hospital.  Really?  Yeah, and, you know, of course, you have no health insurance.  You know, you can't, there's no way we could afford that. 
[03:37:30]  And so your primary care provider becomes the emergency room.  Wow.  And so you get stuck with one of these gigantic, ridiculous bills.  And so here we are, you know, trying to figure out how are we going to pay a $1,200 medical bill.  But, Morgan, you do have health insurance.  You know you're acting.  But, yeah.  On the 31st, you're like, all right, joke's over.  Yeah, I'll pay you on the 1st of next month when I officially have my health insurance.  Well, no, I'm just...  But it's more to show, it's more...  We didn't.  And what happened is after the show, we went back to the hospital, you know. 
[03:38:00]  And after the 30 days was done, and we sat down with them, we were like,  hey, can we, you know, we want to try and figure out a way to pay this off.  And they said, and the cameras were there, we were still shooting it.  And they said, oh, well, we can work something out in terms of a payment plan.  I'm like, you mean, because the camera's here, you're doing this?  You know?  Right, right.  So you're more showing the way it is for people to live.  I mean, even though you know you have health insurance, a lot of people don't.  So it's still a good insight into the way it is for people who make minimum wage.  Exactly.  I mean, I think that what the show does, and, you know, each week we try and do this,  is just to provide enough food for thought to, you know, to make you take a step back 
[03:38:30]  and look at things a little differently.  What kind of job did you hook up with?  I mean, I had a few different jobs over the course of the month.  Because that's the thing is, when you get a job for $5.15 an hour,  and suddenly you find a job where you're going to make $5.50 or $6,  you're like, dude, that's $0.85 more cents.  So, I mean, I worked about four jobs over the course of the whole 30 days,  where I worked as a landscaper.  I worked as a contractor.  Not even as a contractor, but as a guy who just basically was doing, you know,  like drywall in a house, you know, painting.  I worked in, like, a paper factory where I was, like, you know, manufacturing envelopes, 
[03:39:00]  you know, putting envelopes in a box.  And then I worked as a dishwasher in a restaurant.  Well, I actually, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that in your ear.  My God.  I actually, I got a buddy of mine who makes minimum wage.  And he was saying that a lot of times, I mean, you work, you know, 45 or 50 hours.  And he said, you're trying to save your money.  And all of a sudden, if something goes up, I mean, the way the government is structured  with taxes and stuff like that, it's just, you know, because minimum wage,  I mean, when you add it up, I mean, sometimes, you know. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.  And that's what you see in the show tonight is, you know, all you need is one little thing.  Just when you think you're climbing out of this bottomless pit, you know,  when things are looking up, one thing comes along that just knocks you back down to the bottom.  And where did you live?  We lived in Columbus, Ohio, in this part of town called The Bottoms.  Well, if you, anyone in Columbus on...  I lived in Columbus for six years.  Where the hell is that?  The Bottoms?  It's right behind Mount Carmel Hospital, like, right?  It's basically the river bottom.  Oh, God.  Morgan, is that near the Funny Bones or the Comedy Club?  Is that near the Funny Bones?  Oh, dude, I don't know.  Okay, there's the Funny Bones Comedy Club. 
[03:40:00]  Adam Farrar is appearing at tonight.  I'm saying, those of you with discretionary income, you want to come out this weekend.  Yeah, I'll start it tomorrow night.  Help you forget your poverty.  Hey, Morgan, the show's getting a really good review from the Daily News.  Some of the, you know, future episodes.  I heard, what, somebody lives with a Muslim family that's Christian or something like that?  Yeah, we asked the question, what's it like to be a Muslim in America?  And so we took this Christian from West Virginia, you know, somebody who, you know, his idea  of a Muslim is like a guy basically on a mountain with an AK-47. 
[03:40:30]  And we moved this guy to Dearborn for 30 days.  He moves in with a Muslim family and basically becomes a Muslim.  He dresses a Muslim, eats as a Muslim, praises a Muslim for 30 days, and really sees what  it's like to live this way every single day in the United States.  And it's pretty, I mean, it's pretty heavy.  The transformation this guy goes through is remarkable.  Wow.  And how about some of the other episodes?  Oh, I mean, one of the most talked about episodes, and I think which is going to be a really  powerful show, is the binge-drinking mom.  Her daughter's in college at like Arizona State, and the daughter, you know, is basically 
[03:41:00]  doing what most college kids do.  You know, she's become a girl who goes out three, four, five days a week and, you know,  really ties them on.  And the mom just doesn't think she's seeing the repercussions of her actions, the impact  it's having on her own life and the people around her.  And so she says, listen, I'm going to show you.  I'm going to show you what it's doing.  And so the mother becomes a binge-drinker.  Nice.  Yeah.  Does she sing Janis Joplin songs at parties?  While she's laying in the hedge out front.  Yeah. 
[03:41:30]  That sounds like she's sleeping with freshmen.  That's what I was going to say, yeah.  She's banging all the frat guys.  All right, Morgan.  That was a fun part of the show, yeah.  They're telling me you have to go.  No, actually, we have to go.  No worries, Ben.  We have one minute left in the show and they turn off the, it's like a computer, this satellite  radio.  At exactly 11 o'clock, it just flips over and replays it.  So, Morgan Spurlock, thank you so much.  The show's called 30 Days.  It's on tonight at 10 o'clock on FX.  I'll be checking it out.  It sounds like it's going to be a good show.  Awesome.  Thank you, guys.  Good luck, man. 
[03:42:00]  Good luck, Morgan.  Come see us soon, all right, Morgan?  I'd love to.  All right, there he goes.  Morgan Spurlock, everyone.  Really fast.  Let's go around the room.  Adam Farrar, where are you going to be?  Columbus, Funny Bone.  Columbus, Ohio.  Tomorrow night through the weekend.  Jimmy?  I will be with my friend Tyson Walter.  I'll be in Addison Improv in Dallas tomorrow through Saturday, 972-404-8501.  And Anthony and I will be appearing tomorrow.
