<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opens with a rapid-fire, descriptive, and somewhat vulgar introduction, followed by a dismissive remark about Hugh Bledger.  The hosts express their disdain for Mondays, referencing the song "I Don't Like Mondays" and its dark history, then segue into a discussion about other songs with disturbing subtexts, such as "Goodbye Earl."  They move on to discussing old, potentially unsettling photos of Opie,  reminiscing about a listener appreciation party and past radio stunts, including a prank call to Make-A-Wish involving Pamela Anderson and a "Bronco Bash" involving car destruction.

Anthony recounts a humorous, albeit slightly frightening, weekend anecdote about mistaking his cat for an intruder after hearing a loud noise in his basement. This is followed by a movie review of "No Country for Old Men," focusing on the villain's appearance and graphic violence.  The conversation then shifts to the increased viewership of "Brokeback Mountain" following Heath Ledger's death, and Anthony's resistance to watching it.  They announce upcoming guests: Chuck Liddell, Bob Kelly, and Nick DiPaolo. A caller from San Francisco reports the show is being canceled in that city, with the program director explicitly stating his desire for the show's removal.

Anthony details his wild weekend: a Friday night involving guns, strippers, and pool, followed by a Saturday matinee of "The Little Mermaid."  This leads to an extended discussion of Anthony's preferences in women, specifically his preference for white women and his lack of attraction to many of the African-American women at the strip club. He describes a humorous anecdote about a stripper who received a large tip.  The hosts then introduce Chuck Liddell. A listener's instant feedback message is read and mocked for a misunderstanding of a previous discussion.

The interview with Chuck Liddell focuses primarily on his recent victory over Vanderlei Silva, his training regimen, and his thoughts on the differences between fighting in a ring versus a cage. He recounts a humorous anecdote about a street fight between Tito Ortiz and Lee Murray that he partially witnessed. Liddell discusses upcoming UFC fights, including Brock Lesnar's debut and his opinion on Kurt Angle's MMA prospects, as well as his future plans.

Later, Bob Kelly and Nick DiPaolo join the show. DiPaolo discusses his comedy, experiences with hecklers at The Comedy Cellar, and his political views, particularly concerning the Obama campaign and the Clintons.  The conversation is filled with off-color jokes and comments about celebrities and political figures. DiPaolo also promotes his upcoming online radio show.

The show then pivots to a discussion of the upcoming Super Bowl, specifically Patriots vs. Giants, fueled by a New York Post article comparing Tom Brady and Eli Manning’s sex appeal. This leads to vulgar descriptions of both quarterbacks' physiques.  The conversation touches upon politics, mentioning the Kennedys' endorsement of Obama and speculating about Michael Skakel's political leanings. A news story about a woman hiring a hitman on Craigslist sparks derisive comments, followed by tangents about Jim Norton's book, the hosts' therapy experiences, and a bizarre anecdote about a naked man found in a homeowner's bathroom. The show ends with behind-the-scenes complaints about a poorly hung poster in the studio and criticism of an intern’s work.  Nick DiPaolo remains a guest throughout this segment.  A caller, Alice, discusses her OCD.

A subsequent segment features audio clips of Bobby Fischer making anti-Semitic and anti-American statements, prompting reactions of shock and humor from the hosts. They discuss Fischer's erratic behavior and career. TJ Miller's recent appearance on Letterman is mentioned.  Nick DiPaolo, still in studio, recounts several violent altercations with hecklers at comedy clubs, detailing the events graphically and humorously. The conversation broadens to audience behavior, heckling, and the challenges of stand-up comedy.  The hosts offer opinions and jokes about the 2008 presidential election candidates, using crude and offensive language. They also discuss the perceived emasculating portrayal of men in television commercials.

A final segment features DiPaolo discussing perceived liberal bias in media and entertainment, citing examples in commercials, movies, and television shows.  They express frustration over the perceived shift away from traditional gender roles and an overemphasis on political correctness.  The segment includes an intern, Adam (in bunny ears), performing a poor karaoke rendition of "Keep on Loving You."  A caller, Jerry, shares similar views on media bias. The show concludes with further discussion of media bias, a mention of DiPaolo's upcoming blog talk radio show, and a rambling, profanity-laced final exchange among the hosts.  There are mentions of Chuck Liddell and a discussion about sleep apnea prompted by DiPaolo's comment on Heath Ledger's death. The conversation is filled with profanity, misogynistic and homophobic slurs, and discussions of violence and sexual acts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jots, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jots, Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  Jesus, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Usually I'm alright.  That one is...  I've been dropping them all morning, I can't help them.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Oh my God, my eyes are tearing.  I think the celebrities, especially people like a Hugh Bledger,  this boring bitch makes Ambien look like methamphetamine. 
[00:01:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  Shut up, you f***ing moron.  You're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  Die.  Die.  Die.  All right.  Wow.  If we pull this off, we're going to be, what?  Employed.  Employed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Monday.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck.  I did the old wake up, you know, and the alarm hadn't gone off.  You know how you just kind of wake up and you turn and look at the clock and you're so hopeful.  You're so hopeful that maybe it's a couple of hours before you have to get up.  It was one minute before the alarm was going to go off.  That is the worst.  I looked at it. 
[00:02:00]  No.  No.  No.  I want to just leave more.  Ah.  Damn it.  Go, Pats.  Go.  Go, Pats.  Go.  What is that?  What are we, uh, six days out?  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.  Your Mondays.  Uh.  You know, as crazy as it seems, there's days like this that remind me why Manic Monday is my favorite song. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  He's right.  I'm more of a, uh, I don't like Mondays guy.  Oh, you're that guy?  From the Boomtown Rants.  Was that them?  I think.  Was it them?  Who does, uh, I don't like Mondays?  Where it's a cute little song about a girl killing her classmates.  Yeah.  Because she didn't like Mondays.  Adorable.  Yeah.  Cops said, why did you do this?  Ah, because I don't like Mondays.  And then they write a nice pop song about it.  They wrote a song about it and capitalized on it. 
[00:03:00]  It was great.  That's a bit we got to do.  Yeah.  Cute little songs that we just know as just dumb, cute songs.  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  What do they, uh, really mean?  There's probably some horrific subject matters out there.  Yeah.  And you don't even know because you're just kind of singing along not thinking about what you're singing.  Like, this is a horrific song.  Yeah.  Ooh, the drama.  Who was it, E-Roc?  Oh, it is the Boomtown Rats.  You question me.  Not at all.  Thank you, sir.  Not, uh, Opie. 
[00:03:30]  Remember this.  Man.  He always said she was good as gold  And he can see no reasons  Cause there are no reasons  What reason do you need to be shown? 
[00:04:00]  Tell me why I don't like Mondays  Tell me why I don't like Mondays  Tell me why I don't like Mondays  I wanna shoot  Ooh  The whole day down  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Isn't that nice?  That's just terrific.  She goes into school, shoots some people,  and they write a song about it.  It's kind of a big hit.  Than has handed me a little post-it. 
[00:04:30]  We weren't even going to go down this road,  but that's the beauty of us.  The old dirt road?  The old dirt road.  The Dixie Chick song Goodbye Earl  is a song that we all, not all,  I mean, I'm talking in general terms.  A lot of people sing along to,  and it's a horrific song.  Is it a song about an employee  that we all want to say goodbye to at some point?  Unfortunately, no,  because in this song,  Earl gets his comeuppance.  Oh, unlike the Earl we know.  No, who skates by on a daily basis.  No, it's something like all the girls 
[00:05:00]  in my college would all sing along to,  and it's really creepy  because it's about basically killing a guy.  Oh, really?  Hmm.  Yeah, there's a lot of these type of songs.  If you really paid attention to the words,  like, wow, I'm singing about pedophilia  to a Michael Jackson beat.  Tapping my foot to the Holocaust song.  Yeah, right?  Do you know that Ring Around the Rosie,  of course, was about the bubonic plague?  Nice.  To which I had a very high-energy hack bit. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, I remember that one.  I should be shot for it.  I would explain it,  but I would be like,  could you believe this one, guys?  Like, um...  I saw that bit.  Oh.  Oh.  That's nice for children.  Like, oh, it was...  I would explain it and, like...  Oh, I can't even think about it.  I think we had it on the air.  I think we had it on the air back in the day.  Yeah, because I remember hearing it  and just going, like,  and poor Jimmy's sitting in the corner  just all cringey.  Burn the bodies.  Burn the bodies. 
[00:06:00]  If life was fair,  a rifle would just appear from midair  and blow my head off  and then disappear out of the heel.  Just a rifle?  Just a rifle.  No, just the end of a rifle  where the bullet comes out.  No hand, no nothing.  No explanation.  Well, there's things we did in our past  that we're kind of embarrassed about now.  Yeah.  Like, I brought in my Spuds Buckley picture today.  That was adorable.  The little black and white pictures  of Opie dressed like Spuds Buckley.  Which, it's not so much the dress 
[00:06:30]  that's disturbing  as the little hat you're wearing  is disturbing.  Hat?  It's just the do-rag.  Yeah, whatever it was.  It was a little disturbing.  Your youth is very disturbing  because you look like you shouldn't be  with these men that are...  It looks like a Nambla meeting.  It's like men that are jocks at the station  and then a little Opie.  I always looked way too young for my age.  Always.  Is that him with a white jacket? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Wow, dude.  I feel like I look exactly the same, Jimmy.  That's what I thought.  Oh, wait.  Is that Spuds Buckley?  That's actually not that bad.  No, I'm telling you.  I told you ahead of time  it was going to be a letdown.  It was no big deal.  It was more of a...  The voice would be the biggie.  Yeah, which I'll eventually find.  That's what you want to hear.  Huh?  You want to hear the voice.  Yeah, well...  How old are you?  One?  I was probably just out of college. 
[00:07:30]  I looked like I was 15.  I know.  I'm always amazed, too.  Like, you see a picture of yourself  and you're like,  I really thought I did look like that.  And then there's a mirror.  You're like, oh.  Oh, I know.  That time is a bitch.  I know.  It stinks.  No one gets past that one, unfortunately.  How old are you here?  I said, like, 22, 23.  Somewhere around there.  God damn.  Yeah.  We'll put the pictures up  on onaradio.com later today.  It's really...  It's no big deal.  Somebody from the station, you know, 
[00:08:00]  shot some black and whites  as I'm out there,  like, just messing around  in Buffalo morning traffic.  Oh, you're standing in the middle of the road  for some reason.  Helping out...  giving out free newspapers for the day.  All right.  Yes.  And then I like the news clipping  about how you guys are hosting  a listener appreciation party.  Oh, the press clipping?  Listener appreciation parties stink.  Well, no.  It was just some artist  that was performing at a local club.  Let me see. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, but it said listener appreciation.  Are they all nice to you, these DJs?  Yeah, most of them I still like, actually.  Yeah, Iron Mike Benson is still cool  doing radio up in the Buffalo area.  Dwayne Daugherty is like the king of Dallas radio.  Bob Richards just got a job.  Oh, God.  He was just in the news.  I know this is very inside,  but he was a great PD.  And Tony Magoo had his health issues,  but I think he's doing better now.  It's funny because the guy's name  was Iron Mike something,  but I love how they always do it to you, too.  They put quotes around the iron part. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You wouldn't be sure if that was his name.  That's not on my birth certificate.  Please put a quote around it.  This is how sad this is.  This is when we were doing a listener party  for an artist called Chrissy Steele.  I think she was from Canada.  Chrissy Steele.  Look up Chrissy Steele.  What the hell is she?  She's probably dead,  but that's who we're in the picture with.  We'll put these up on onaradio.com later today.  You can check them out.  No big deal.  I'm going through boxes finally, 
[00:09:30]  and I am finding all sorts of crap.  Yeah.  And we're going to start putting them up  on the websites.  I found a memo from Dave Dickless.  Oh.  From our Boston days.  Yeah.  Scolding us for our Make-A-Wish prank call we did.  And, well, he should have.  He's just destroying us, like,  officially in this memo.  Thank God we never listened to him.  That's obviously going into our file.  Thank God we never listened to him.  Basically, I called Make-A-Wish  as a father of a sick kid. 
[00:10:00]  Yep.  And I asked if we could get Pamela Anderson.  Mm-hmm.  Pamela Lee.  Yeah.  To come over to my house  and take care of...  And service the poor child.  Well, and actually take care of me  because it was my...  Oh, that was it.  Right.  It wasn't even about the kid.  The kid's wish was that his father...  Right, right.  ...would be able to have sex  with Pamela Lee Anderson,  whatever she was at the time.  Yeah.  So, yeah, that was the father calling up  and saying,  but it's my child's, like, wish.  Yeah.  And he wants to see me have sex with her. 
[00:10:30]  And this is why we went on  to greatness in radio.  And Dave Dickless rotted in Boston.  Yeah.  He wrote this horrendous memo  scolding us for this prank call  how it's not cool,  you shouldn't be doing stuff like this  on your radio show,  blah, blah, blah.  And it's blind CC, blind CC, blind CC  to everybody in the company.  Copy, paste, copy, paste.  Oh, it has all that weird stuff  at the bottom of the letter.  Half the stuff,  you don't even know what it means.  It's all sorts of corporate codes and stuff.  So I found that last night  and I'll bring that in 
[00:11:00]  and we'll scan it  and we'll throw it on our website.  I'm convinced his wife  had everything to do  with his decision making.  Yeah, well...  Like, I think he just had no set on him  and his wife would say,  that was disgusting.  I never want to hear that again  on your station.  Our friends, I'm embarrassed to see them,  blah, blah, blah.  And just, he would go, okay,  and then come in and say,  you shouldn't do that.  Write a memo, memo, memo.  Right, right.  Well, wait till you see this memo.  It's going to make you cringe.  Bring back memories, I'm sure. 
[00:11:30]  So, and we're starting a section  on opiananthony.com.  It's called Opie and Anthony Old School.  And we're bringing back  some old video clips.  We'll bring back some of these  press clippings from our old days.  Yeah.  I found XFL game tapes.  I'll bring those in.  I found Real Rock TV videotapes.  Ooh.  Slowly but surely.  I'm just going to bring in  a little at a time.  I brought in a whole box for E-Rock.  He's going to go through it  in the coming days  and let me know  what's on some of this stuff.  I don't even know what's on it  because a lot of the cassettes  that I handed over to E-Rock today, 
[00:12:00]  there's no label on them.  No.  So there might be a nugget in there,  stuff that we forgot about years ago.  A nugget.  I'll tell you this much.  I found the radio show  where we bashed a Bronco  when the Jets were playing the Broncos.  Oh, yeah.  Kind of a hack radio bit,  but we went to Menachie.  Yep.  And now we all know  and love Pat from Menachie,  but Ant and I did a live broadcast  Yeah, we know him.  from Menachie, New Jersey,  and we had listeners  just taking a sledgehammer 
[00:12:30]  to a Bronco.  To a Bronco.  That's how we got the Jets  ready to play the Bronco.  Hey, hey.  I was going to beat up the Bronco.  Oh.  See?  But I think it was one of our first  live appearances we ever did  in the New York area  after moving back home, so.  It's a good thing we didn't live in Denver.  Have to get a big 747.  Yeah.  Start hacking it apart.  You know.  Jets.  Excuse me.  But Bronco Bash,  January 15th, 1999. 
[00:13:00]  Wow.  E-Rock's got it in his box,  so he's going to go through that stuff  and start, like,  bringing some of that stuff  to the show  so we can replay it a little bit  and have some fun  and go...  The classics.  Check it out.  Yeah.  There you go.  How was your weekend, Anthony?  Great.  Well, last night,  had to pull the shotgun  for the first time ever.  Yeah?  In the house.  Did you get mouthy?  Yeah.  Got a little lippy.  Wait, wait, wait.  I had a...  Well, I...  You just floored me  because I saw, like,  on your iPhone, 
[00:13:30]  some video of you...  Oh, I have some video  of me at the range.  That's the FS2000.  So you were shooting  that all weekend?  I was shooting that  all weekend.  But you actually pulled  your shotgun...  Well, we're laying in bed  and watching...  She got lippy?  Yeah.  Had to...  Had to...  The old butt of the gun.  No, we were watching  No Country for Old Men.  And carried away?  Which got a little carried away.  It was an inspirational movie.  It was very inspirational.  And I'll give my review later. 
[00:14:00]  It's not pertinent  to the story, actually.  The...  And then I hear  from downstairs  a loud crashing noise.  That's your stupid cat.  You're gonna kill Jack-Jack.  No, I'm not gonna kill Jack-Jack.  See what I do is...  I lean a folding chair.  There's this folding chair  against the basement door  at very...  It's very precarious. 
[00:14:30]  So that if that basement door  ever opens up,  that chair smashes on the floor  and makes a big, loud noise.  Now, that is only because  I'm just leery of the basement.  A little leery of the basement  and the security.  It's all there.  I mean, it's alarmed and everything.  But when I looked up,  I noticed the alarm was not set.  Which was an error.  A grave error.  So I heard this crash.  Assumed it was the cat. 
[00:15:00]  But you just can't make  that assumption.  So I got up,  grabbed the shotgun,  and now I have to go  around the house.  You are going to...  I have to do a search.  ...kill somebody.  So...  No, I wasn't racked.  Safety's on.  I have the light on.  So I'm just walking around.  I'm very safe.  The finger isn't on the trigger.  I'm looking.  Right now, it's just looking.  There's no immediate threat.  But I then went down 
[00:15:30]  in the basement.  I had to turn the light on  and go down in the basement.  Oh, that's creepy.  And oh, was I geared up.  Were you scared?  Waiting for...  No!  I was waiting.  He was ready.  I was happy.  He's been waiting for this.  Oh, come on, intruder.  He's been waiting for this moment  his entire life.  What do you mean he was scared?  My God, please!  Yeah, and it did turn out  to be a little Jack-Jack  tipped the chair over  and made a big, loud racket. 
[00:16:00]  It was very loud.  No, no.  I gave him a little pat on the head  and a little shook-a-shook  under the chin.  Shook-a-shook.  And then put the shotgun back down.  And then made Jack-Jack flip a coin.  Flip a coin, Jack-Jack.  Flip a coin.  Heads or kibble.  Heads or tails, Jack-Jack.  Heads or tails.  You better keep that coin.  It's your lucky coin, Jack-Jack.  Oh, boy.  It won Best Picture, I think,  at the SAG Awards, right?  Best Movie.  Did it?  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  I just...  The ending was a little...  I understand they really  couldn't go any further with it,  but it was a little surprising  and a little like, uh-huh.  I agree.  Yeah, the storyline had a couple of holes,  but I still liked it.  Yeah, yeah.  I think I gotta go right...  Right.  It's already written.  I gotta read the book, I think.  They say there's a lot in the book  that they didn't cover in the movie.  The bad guy,  I forget his name in the movie,  but he's got...  He looks like Prince Valiant hair.  It's like a sugar, a sugar...  Sugar, yes.  I forget his real name. 
[00:17:00]  It was something...  I can't remember.  But he was great.  He was a great bad guy.  Amazing.  Yeah.  I think he made that movie.  What a creep.  Totally original, yeah.  A really original vibe for a bad guy.  It's like he was...  The only thing is,  Jimmy ruined the movie for me  because all I was thinking is  is how horrible he is,  but how he had that  tussleable little hairdo,  his Prince Valiant hair.  Did you want to give his hair  a little rustle  and say how heads it is?  The...  One of my favorite scenes in there  was right at the beginning  where he takes out the cop 
[00:17:30]  in the station house.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Oh, is that brutal?  He chokes him with handcuffs.  It's just brutal.  All the scuff marks on the floor.  But then when he was cleaning his wrists  later on in that scene  where his wrists were all left up  because that's how hard he was like...  Yeah.  ...using the handcuffs against the guy.  Yeah.  That seemed to be a real accurate depiction  of someone being strangled, too.  Oh, yeah.  Because it wasn't quick  and it looked very painful. 
[00:18:00]  Good movie, though,  you know, for what it was.  The end was a little abrupt.  Weird.  How many...  I'm talking to the guys out there.  How many of your chicks  decided they needed to watch  Brokeback Mountain  because Heath Ledger died?  Oh, did it all of a sudden...  Was it on every cable channel  and everything?  I love how they do that.  Oh, coincidentally enough,  this was on our schedule.  Sure it was.  I don't know.  I had a couple errands in the area,  so I'm out  and I call home  and my chick's like,  yeah, you know, 
[00:18:30]  do you want to watch  Brokeback Mountain with me?  I'm like,  I have no desire to see this movie.  I know you saw it  and it was filmed beautifully  and had rave reviews  and all this crap.  I just don't want to see it.  No?  I just have no desire  to see this movie.  It's like a...  It's a good movie, though.  No, I...  But, you know...  I understand that.  It's gay.  They got the gay parts,  but the rest of it isn't,  you know,  it's not like watching  a gay porno movie  or anything, right?  Right.  But I have a feeling  I'm not alone.  I think a lot of guys, 
[00:19:00]  they're chicks,  want to see a freaking  Heath Ledger movie  because he died.  Yeah.  I chose not to.  I chose to just wander around.  Oh, did she watch it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, I just didn't...  Did she cry?  I don't know.  I didn't ask her  because she watched  the second half  while I was falling asleep,  so I'll have to find out  later today.  I haven't seen it.  I heard it was really...  I own it.  I have a copy of it.  I just have not watched it yet.  I want to see it.  They say it's great.  I just don't have  a desire to see it.  You got Chuck Liddell  at 7.  Maybe me and Chuck  will go watch it.  Yeah.  All right.  Nice.  Why don't we take a break 
[00:19:30]  because we do want  to do a few things  before we get  Chuck Liddell in here.  Also, who else  is coming in?  Bob Kelly at 7  and we got, of course,  Nick DiPaolo  finally coming in at 8.  Oh, right on.  Yeah, I got sick  when he was supposed  to come in,  so we rescheduled him  and Bob Kelly  wants to meet Chuck Liddell,  so he's coming back.  That's pretty cool.  Bob makes me sick.  Bob's going to try...  Like when Bob we had  over on XM,  we had a...  Who's the wrestler?  We had MVP.  Yeah.  And he's a scary guy.  He's an ex-convict  and he's a very nice dude,  but we're talking  about being scared  of him kidding around.  Bob's like,  no, dude, I'm not scared. 
[00:20:00]  It's like,  shut your fat mouth.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, admit it.  I'm trying to act  like you're the guy  who can handle  the tough guys.  You're not.  Remember,  this MVP from the WWE,  he had a hard life.  He was, what,  in jail for...  Nine and a half years.  Nine and a half years  for armed robbery  and kidnapping charges  and now he's a star  in the WWE.  And all of a sudden,  he's telling us  his prison story,  his life story,  and it was horrific.  It was like,  holy crap, right?  And Bob Kelly  is trying to relate to him  because he went 
[00:20:30]  to Juvie Hall too.  Yeah, and I made Bob  say what he did  because I knew  what Bob was in for.  He's like,  yeah, dude,  I was in Juvie.  I'm like,  what was your crime?  Stealing gumball machines?  Exactly.  But he's trying  to relate to MVP.  Trying to relate.  Because the story  with MVP,  because he was underage,  he had to go  to Juvie Hall first.  And Bob's like,  yeah, I've been there too.  Been there too.  I understand  what you're talking about.  What'd you do?  What were you in for?  They're robbing  gumball machines, dude.  Dude, I'm not scared. 
[00:21:00]  Okay, Bob,  you're the guy  who handles the tough guys.  We're all women.  You take it from here.  I hope Liddell just,  I hope Liddell slaps his face.  Oh, would that be great.  Just open palm,  like slaps his face.  He slaps your fat face.  I had a manly,  a very manly  Friday.  Yeah.  And a very  wussy Saturday.  That's a great tease.  Yeah, thanks.  We'll find out next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Phone number  877-212-ON-A.  I want to say hi to Steve.  Calling from San Francisco.  Steve, what's up?  Pretty good, Steve.  Hey, listen,  I'm calling only because  I found out yesterday  in our paper  that you guys,  as of March,  I don't even know if you guys know it,  are going to be off the air here.  Yeah, we're on an AM station  in San Francisco  and I was reading  in one of the,  I don't know,  radio, 
[00:22:00]  on one of the radio websites  that the PD can't wait,  can't wait to say goodbye to us.  Can't wait.  That's great.  Well, that's what I got out of it.  But basically,  the PD said  we're too expensive  to maintain.  And what do you expect  when our city flag  is a rainbow?  Well, San Francisco,  I mean,  it's a,  it's a,  I had a thought  and it left.  It's a good city,  but I mean,  let's be honest,  they're very hypersensitive there  and a lot of issues.  Very.  You know,  they condemned Mike Savage 
[00:22:30]  because he said naughty thing,  you know.  We were,  we were taking off  an FM station a while ago.  They threw us on an AM,  which is basically  not being on the radio.  And now that is going away  and the PD pretty much  is saying he can't wait.  So.  Can I,  can I ask you guys a question?  Yeah.  Okay.  Seeing that it's Super Bowl,  are you guys going to give away  any prizes where you guys  get to go and sit  in someone's living room  and have people stare at you?  Linger longer.  Linger longer.  Linger longer.  Hey Steve,  a couple,  a couple things.  I believe on onaradio.com 
[00:23:00]  there's a link  where you can listen to us online,  right?  Oh,  actually I have you guys on XM.  I've had you guys  since day one on XM.  Oh,  well,  thank you,  sir.  We greatly appreciate that.  Jimmy,  I can't wait to see you  February 15th.  Thank you.  Where is that?  Oh,  San Francisco.  Okay.  He just looked all panicked.  Jimmy's face is all panicked.  Where?  I thought this was a whole  Megan's Law court thing.  He thought he was coming  over your house.  I'll be out there.  Can't wait to see you.  Thanks,  man.  All right,  Steve.  Have a great day.  All right.  It's going to get very interesting 
[00:23:30]  in the next couple of weeks  to say the least.  And to be honest with you,  I swear to God,  I didn't even realize  we were still on Terrestrial  in San Francisco.  Oh,  we're on it,  I am.  And the PD,  the PD got rid of Adam Carolla  as soon as his contract was up  and he's doing the same with us.  Yeah.  And he pretty much mentioned  that in the paper.  That's what he's doing  and he can't wait.  He can't wait,  so.  Yeah,  I didn't even know.  We really didn't give him  much attention,  I guess.  Well,  we stopped giving it attention  when we got off the FM.  Yeah.  And then they kind of  threw a bunch of talk shows  on an AM station.  They buried us. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  You know,  when they throw you on an AM,  unless you're like Rush Limbaugh,  they're burying you.  Yeah.  They're getting rid of you.  That means you just got,  they got to ride out some time.  Right, right.  They just put you there.  Like,  ah,  just throw him on the dumb AM.  That's pretty much a CB radio  at this point.  All right,  so what were you saying  before the break?  Oh,  I had probably  a very manly Friday  and the exact opposite Saturday. 
[00:24:30]  Friday was full of guns and strippers.  Strippers?  How about that,  huh?  VIP club.  That's fun.  Well,  we weren't near the VIP club.  Well,  we'd have gone there,  but we weren't near there.  And I wasn't driving,  which was good.  And the strippers were men.  But,  yeah,  well,  Friday I decided  I was going to hit the range  with the new FS2000,  my new little weapon. 
[00:25:00]  And went down to the range,  zeroed in my sights,  and had a good time down there.  Loved shooting.  I accidentally,  you know the,  when you pull your target back,  you do the little crank thing,  and the pulleys pull your target back,  and you see what you did,  you put a new target up,  and you can crank it,  and it goes back.  I,  I shot through the string  that pulls your target back  inadvertently.  The guy asked me  if I'd done it on purpose.  He goes, 
[00:25:30]  because that would be a good shot.  But,  nah,  a lot of fun,  though,  shooting that gun.  I,  I have a video of it  that I'll,  I'll put up.  I'll give it to Steve.  He'll put it somewhere  where you can never find it.  And,  then,  Friday night  was going,  out,  doing some drinking,  and,  hitting the strip club.  And,  saw some,  With who?  There was,  well,  it was the people from,  the,  XM, 
[00:26:00]  I gotta get it right,  what is it?  My,  XM,  radio store?  My radio store.  My radio store dot com.  Yeah,  you know,  Ziggy and stuff.  Right.  Well,  him and the staff  over there.  And,  first we went  to shoot some pool.  Then,  went to the strip clubs.  And,  Danny and Marissa  were there too.  Having a blast.  Then,  went to,  you know,  the strip clubs.  And,  there's a whole thing  going on where, 
[00:26:30]  I don't,  I don't know.  Strip clubs,  they just change  constantly.  Uh,  now,  you're at the point  where you,  you watch  the strippers  on stage.  Then,  they come by  in front of you.  You're at the bar  and just stand there  and wait for you  to give them money.  They're fully clothed now.  You don't,  like,  throw the money  at them  while they're on stage.  They don't come over  naked and take money  from you.  By the time  you give them money,  they're completely clothed.  They had just gotten  off the stage 
[00:27:00]  and now they do  a lap around the bar,  each of them,  to get your money.  Like,  that is,  that's the worst  goddamn way  to, uh,  That's extortion.  So,  well,  we had a little fun  with it.  I hope so.  Because,  like,  you should be able  to just throw money  at the one  you want to throw money at.  Exactly.  There's a reason  why you don't throw money  at all the strippers.  Right!  Because some of them  don't deserve it.  It's not even that.  You're not attracted  to them in any way.  You're not attracted.  You're not hot. 
[00:27:30]  You're not my type.  You danced horribly.  Your song selection  was bad.  I don't know.  I'm just throwing crap out there.  You're fat.  And then you get the one  where it's the one  you're like,  whoa!  And then you're  emptying your wallet.  Yeah,  well,  I caused...  That's how it should work.  I caused quite a stir.  Yeah?  I caused quite a stir.  Yeah,  I was, uh,  I was standing there  at the bar  and the girls  are coming up  and, um,  certain girls,  without getting into  any detail  whatsoever,  I wouldn't tip 
[00:28:00]  at all.  And I'm not saying  who, uh,  would come by  that I would  not ever tip.  I'm just not  attracted.  You're not attracted  to black girls?  I didn't say that.  I said certain girls.  I know you're trying  to speak in code,  but I need to know  why.  Um...  A black girl stripping  is a big-time turn-on.  There's very few  that are attractive  and they have to be mixed.  Is it out of principle?  No, no,  it's not out of principle. 
[00:28:30]  I know you were  trying to speak in code there,  but I couldn't let that  just go.  I don't find  many  African-American girls  attractive,  especially the girls  at these strip clubs.  What about the time  we were in Atlanta?  Hold on, hold on.  Very, um,  um,  not, not firm.  What about the time  we were in Atlanta?  A lot of the girls  that were there.  What about it?  And I think it was  the Motley Crue strip club.  I mean,  they sang a song.  I think this song  is about...  Dimensions on Atlanta.  I believe,  or whatever. 
[00:29:00]  We were in a strip club  that has some connection  to Motley Crue,  and there was a black girl  that had, like,  an extra ass.  Remember her?  I like that, though.  I don't like...  It wasn't, like, big.  It was like,  there was an extra, like,  something going on  back there.  Wow.  All right, go ahead.  I'm, I'm,  I'm really, you know,  I'm sorry.  I'm into white chicks.  I just am.  I like white girls.  The whiter, the better.  Yeah, obviously.  I just, you know,  I just like,  I like a good pale girl.  I just, that's my preference. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I like Spanish girls  and black girls.  I prefer my white chicks.  I'm just,  that's,  that's what I'm into.  So, you're not,  so, you're not turned on  by a black chick  taking her clothes off.  No, it wasn't really  doing anything for me.  There were a couple  that were,  kind of good looking  and I would,  I would tip them.  Not as much  as the white girls, though.  Because I was very attracted  to, you know,  some of the white girls.  So, there's one chick.  She's like,  really hot.  Kind of tall,  dark hair, 
[00:30:00]  really cute face.  And she comes by  and I realize  I hadn't gotten  a stack of ones yet  and I had some hundreds  on me and stuff.  So, I just gave her a hundred.  And she goes,  do you need change?  I go, no,  that's for you.  Go ahead.  So, she just gives me  this look  and she was like,  oh, thank you.  And then she kind of  walks away  and she wouldn't stop  looking the whole night.  And then,  she must have told  all the other strippers  because they were like  seagulls  and I had french fries  at the beach.  They just kept coming by 
[00:30:30]  and then  we all started playing  the let's completely  ignore them  and see how long  they'll stand  in front of us game.  Because, like I said,  they come by  and wait for you.  They don't say anything.  A lot of times  they'll just stand there.  So, me and my girlfriend  and Danny and Marissa  were just standing around  talking  and not looking at them  but out of our peripheral  we see they're standing  right in front of us  and some of them  will just stand there 
[00:31:00]  and not leave  until you gotta  kind of turn around  and make eye contact  and go, oh, oh,  and I'll give them  like a buck  because I didn't want  to tip her anyway.  And other girls  just stand there,  stand there  and then just slink away  get nothing.  Exactly the way men do  when we try to talk  to them in public.  Yeah, exactly.  Why do they all  they don't all deserve  to get tipped.  They don't all deserve  to get tipped  the same amount.  Like one girl  I'd give like a five to  and then another girl  would get a 20  and then some girls  I wouldn't give anything to.  Why? 
[00:31:30]  Pimple on the butt.  Fat.  Saggy.  Like they had  a smorgasbord  of girls there.  I could understand  some guys  probably into  every type of girl  that was there  you'd find a guy  that was into it.  But one girl  she was  this black chick  she had a way  close to 300 pounds.  It was  just a huge  woman.  Big  huge cans  huge ass  and she's up there  shaking what she's got  and I guess  you know 
[00:32:00]  some guys find that  attractive  but me  I wasn't gonna  I wasn't gonna  pull out anything.  You know  George Washington  staying on the bar.  You gotta  say to them  sometimes  if a girl  standing there  I've had that  and you go  look  maybe a little  bit later  because you're  a pig.  Oh because  you're a pig  add that in.  But be nice  about it  with a smile  and they won't  even know  what you just said.  And then there was  a girl that was  giving lap dances.  For some reason  all the strippers  weren't giving lap dances  or something  because I'd have  gotten one from  a really hot girl 
[00:32:30]  that I found  attractive  but none of them  are really  coming around  and getting  for lap dances.  They save that  for a certain few.  And this one girl  is supposedly  you know  oh great  great  at giving lap dances  she's fantastic  but I look at her  and she does  nothing for me.  And my girlfriend  is going  oh but yeah  it's what she does  it's really good  you know  she'll stand  in front of you  you know  take down  the panty  Wait how does  your girlfriend know?  Because she went in 
[00:33:00]  and got a lap dance.  so she'll take  her G-string down  and show you things  You're getting  strict love advice  from your girlfriend  Yeah I know  I know  Tell me about it  You just casually  go oh yeah  well  No because  I would have  gotten one  from a girl  I found attractive  but this girl  wasn't attractive  and she goes  oh yeah  but you know  you see what  she does back there  I was like  I don't care  what she does  it doesn't matter  to me  if the girl  is talented  if I don't 
[00:33:30]  find her attractive  get out  You know what's  funny about that  like you just said  how your girlfriend  has gone to the strip club  and she knows  that this particular  dancer is really good  Yeah  and we're not like  outraged by that  at all right  No  It's just accepted  in this society  Now turn that around  and tell your girlfriend  that you went to  a male strip club  Yeah he's great  He's great  You should see  what he does  back there  Right  Just shakes it  in your face  All hell would 
[00:34:00]  break loose  Like what  After he's done  your face smells  like onion rings  You know what I'm saying  I'm just like  oh god  That is amazing  how that works  in society today  And yes  there were  Russian strippers  which I guess  Seth from Jersey  wanted to ask  but I'll just  answer him  There were Russian strippers  some of them  very cute  but  that voice  comes out  and it's over  You want to  make  I make the dance 
[00:34:30]  for you  the dance  I make a sexy dance  No  You just ruined it  with that  accent  How long have you  been here  Could you not say  make the sexy dance  because it doesn't  make the sexy dance  Yeah  I tip him  as I seize him  So his pool  strippers  The pool hall  First guns  then the pool hall  then the strippers  and then  late night 
[00:35:00]  getting back  to the house  slept until  I think  five in the afternoon  It was just  a ridiculous  really good  night out  and then  Saturday  I had to get  ready quick  because  we had to  go catch  the Broadway  production  of The Little  Mermaid  Oh yes  Under the sea  Okay  Terrific  I go from

[00:39:30]  on the Opie and  Anthony show  Stay there  Hey good morning  to ya  It's a stupid  Monday  Yeah we got  Chuck Liddell  coming into the  studio  Really fast though  we got this guy  Eric on  instant feedback  You know  people are  commenting about  the show  as we do it  and every once  in a while  they make a mistake  and that's okay  but when you send  in your  the same instant  feedback  a hundred times  that means  you're basically  banned from  instant feedback  because you're  just taking up  all the space  so now you gotta  figure out another 
[00:40:00]  way to send  in your feedback  Yeah  And then he  writes something  stupid over  and over again  and I'm embarrassed  to say this  and read this  in front of  Chuck Liddell  but I will  He writes  it's Eric O'Neill  from Wareham  Massachusetts  You guys are talking  about how it's  okay today  for females  to go to  the strip club  and give  strip club  advice to guys  but if it were  the other way  around  all hell  would break  loose  Break loose  Question  Why would you  want to go  to a male  strip club  to begin with  And he sent  it in a hundred  times  Eric you're 
[00:40:30]  stupid  You don't  get the  bit  or don't  get the  gist  of the  conversation  guy  Of course  That's hot  That's why  we'd want  to go  We don't  want to go  to a male  strip club  That's the  whole point  of what we  were discussing  you idiot  The point  is guys  don't do  that  and wouldn't  do that  and put  in that  hypothetical  situation  it would  be a  catastrophe  We weren't  saying that  And that's  what made  the bit  interesting  What a  dummy  Because women  can go  around and 
[00:41:00]  just casually  talk about  their lesbian  experiences  and no one's  going to  go what  oh my god  what is wrong  with you  guys think  it's hot  Get him  down here  so Chuck  Liddell  could just  kick him  I got his  address  and we're  going to  send Chuck  Liddell  to his  house  Why make  the guy  come to  New York  for his  beating  Chuck  will come  to you  James  I have a  Bob to  show up  How you  doing Chuck  Good  How you  doing  Good  Congratulations  on the  book  Look at  you  with a  book  Oh  thanks  We've  had Chuck  on the  show  many  times  and this 
[00:41:30]  book  looks  like  a  great  read  I  haven't  been  able  to  start  yet  but  Jimmy  has  I  was  perusing  it  I  left  early  last  week  because  I  was  sick  and it's  great  it's  really  like  the  opening  line  is  about  how  people  the  most  common  question  they  ask  you  is  about  what's  it  like  to  walk  down  the  street  and  not  be  afraid  of  anything  so  it  starts  off  interesting  immediately  and  there's  a great  line  here  I  wanted  to  ask  you  about  do  you  really  dislike  Tito  Ortiz  um  I  I  I'm  not a  big  fan  of  his  no  it  really  comes  across 
[00:42:00]  oh  really  yeah  it's  what page  Jimmy  I want  to enjoy  this  it's  on page  179  it's  right  there's  a great  color  photo  section  in here  and oh  where the  hell  is it  I  should  have  marked  it  something  about  before  you  get  to  that  how old  are you  right  here  as a  wrestler  as a  sophomore  in high  school  I  can't  you're  embarrassed  by that  picture  I'm  assuming  we  were  forced  to wear  those  it's  a typical  high  school  wrestling 
[00:42:30]  get up  the next  year  we got  to  lose  the  point  I'm  going  to  make  as a  sophomore  you look  like a  badass  who  looks  like a  badass  as a  sophomore  in high  school  dude  I  wouldn't  fight him  when he  had the  little  boy  scout  hat  on  there's  a  picture  of  Chuck  it's  really  it's  actually  he's  like  a cute  kid  and  if  you  just  saw  this  picture  of  any  kid  you  wouldn't  think  anything  he's  just  a  cute  little  boy  with  a  little  yellow  thing  and a  scout  hat  and  there's  another  picture  he turns  into  Chuck  Liddell  yeah  it's  like  that  little  boy  right  there  putting 
[00:43:00]  his fist  in the  people's  jaw  you can  never  look at  the  kid  and  realize  what  the  adult  is  going  to  be  like  well  he's  got  the  death  there  as  a  kid  how  old  are  you  there  man  I  don't  know  it  even  says  five  or  six  it  says  ice  man  death  there  and  it  says  I  was  born  with  it  I  mean  you  look  really  scary  as  a  five  or  six  year  old  even  there's  a  picture  of  it  it's  cute  because  you  got  two  cute  little  kid  pictures  and  you  turn  two  pages  and  he's  in  the  middle  of  what  looks  like  a  homicide  and 
[00:43:30]  it's  him  pounding  on  Randy  Couture  it's  really  great  bloody  photos  in this  color  section  man  it's  really  good  we're  getting  to  the  Ortiz  I'm  sorry  we want  to  put a  little  tangent  there  it never  pays  to  mouth  off  and I  immediately  knew  who  this  one  was  going  to be  about  the  opening  line  and  this  is  where  Chuck  kind  of  veils  the  fact  that  he's  not  crazy  about  Tito  but I  read  through  it  I'm  not  sure  why  Tito  is  afraid  to  fight  me  but  wouldn't  hesitate  to  fight  Randy  maybe  he  felt  he  had  to  fight  or  else  he'd  be  even  more  of a  joke  as  champ  than  he  already  was  that's  kind  insightful 
[00:44:00]  to the  fact  that  you're  not  really  looking at  him as  a  champion  and  you're  not  like  really  like  a  crap  talker  what  is  about  him  that  just  well  you know  he just  he's  only  he makes  a living  off running  his mouth  and then  if you're  running  your mouth  and you're  fighting  anybody  they'll  throw  at you  fine  but if  you're  running  your mouth  and picking  and choosing  fights  I don't  like it  I don't  care  about a  guy that  runs  his mouth  if you're  willing to  fight  anybody  they put  in front  of you  go ahead  run  your mouth  if you 
[00:44:30]  back  it up  go right  ahead  no  Chuck  that's  just  like  what  we do  with our  radio show  is it  and then  we take  on some  other radio  guys and  they talk  a good  game  but then  when it  comes to  us  they  whatever  we'll get  into it  in our  book  someday  but  I was  able to  relate  to that  big time  at least  it doesn't  end with  us getting  our faces  punched  in  not much  blood  involved  in radio  wars  that would  be funny  at the  end  of the  radio  war  if  one  radio  guy  was  on  the  ground  and  a  guy  like  him  with  a 
[00:45:00]  mohawk  and two  little  games  behind  the  scenes  and  they  don't  actually  take  you  on  the  airwaves  and  that's  why  I can  relate  to what  you're  saying  because  I  stopped  my  point  there  it's  being  a  pussy  to me  so  basically  we're  saying  we're  the  Chuck  Liddell  of  radio  the  Opie  Anthony  show  so  we're  in  good  company  you  look  good  man 
[00:45:30]  I've  never  seen  you  this  awake  at  6  30  7  o'clock  the  way  everything  was  set  up  I  left  at  11  30  from  home  I  slept  until  about  11  went  to  the  airport  we  flew  out  at  1  30  so  I  had  to  leave  at  11  30  so  then  I  got  here  I  got  here  I  sleep  on  planes  because  I  get  bored  even  if  I  not  tired  I  sleep  on  a  plane  because  I  just  can't  sit  I  call it  time  machining  you end 
[00:46:00]  up  where you  want to  go  and  it  seems  like  no  time  has  passed  love that  I  woke up  for a  little  bit  8  and  I  went  back  to  sleep  so  I  didn't  do  nothing  but  sleep  for  the  last  24  hours  so  should  be  fine  you  flying  first  now  if  I  would  hope  so  you  are  flying  first  class  the  people  who  don't  know  who  you  are  like  older  people  look at  you  like  maybe  if  you  sit  down  next  to  them  and  go  who  is  this  person  he's got  a tattoo  on his  skull  he's  frightening 
[00:46:30]  me  I see that  sometimes  especially  a couple  years  back  I've been  going  flying first  class  for a couple  years  now  but a  couple  years  back  before  people  now  at least  they can  go  hey  who  is  that  someone  will  be  able  to  answer  a couple  years  ago  they might  not  I don't  know  why  is he  sitting  up here  with us  imagine  some  poor  dumb  hijacker  gets on  the plane  and goes  oh my god  I picked  the plane  with Chuck  Liddell  where's the 
[00:47:00]  plane going  because  that's  where I'm  going  signaling  his friends  ixnay  on a signal  you just  came off  man  I watched  the fight  you came  off  what they  say  might be  the biggest  win of  your career  which was  I mean  the guy  it's so  amazing  the parody  in  your game  because  he beat  I think  Quentin  twice  twice  Quentin  beat you  twice  and then  you come  back  and beat  him 
[00:47:30]  and it  was a  dude  what a  fight  that was  man  that son  of a  bitch  can take  a punch  oh yeah  you know  honestly  I thought  I always  thought  he's a  good  great  fighter  but I  always  thought  he had  a  and he  has  that  flash  chin  but I  always  thought  he  recovered  quick  but you  know  I didn't  know  he recovered  that  quick  you know  I  rock him  and you  know  I get  on him  I jump  on people  when I  rock him  I get  on him  start  hitting him  and he  keep  coming  I mean  to his  credit  man  a lot  of guys  would have  quit  I mean  you're  swinging  you're  hitting  him  and you  know  a lot  of guys  in their 
[00:48:00]  minds  I won't  say names  like Tito  but  decided to  quit  not respond  but he  would keep  coming back  keep coming  back  you bloodied  him  there was  one part  with the  fighting  and they  said  and so  was bleeding  from the  ear  man  you don't  hear that  in traditional  boss  his ear  was bleeding  is that  bad  when that  happens  as opposed  to good  yeah  not good  no  and in  the second  round  it looked  like you  you slipped  it was  obviously a  slip  I've never 
[00:48:30]  seen anybody  get up  it was  almost like  you just  wanted to  jump up  and go  it's a  slip  I get  it  I slipped  and then  you fell  back again  and I  thought he  hit you  until the  replay  show  that you  actually  slipped  again  after you  hit him  and you  backed  up  yeah  that ring  gets slippery  out there  and it's  the canvas  it's hard  you know  the combination  between  everything  it's hard  to keep  attracted  all kinds  of goop  down there  on that  canvas  man  you don't  get sweaty  and I get  real sweaty  so  yeah like  Jimmy said  that was a  huge win  because you  went into it 
[00:49:00]  as the  underdog  technically  people were  looking at  you as  the underdog  right  two losses  in a row  I mean  it's very rare  for you to  have that  happen  people weren't  sure  how I was  going to  show up  I think  some of it  had to do  with I got  away from  being a mixed  martial artist  I started  listening to  people and  just being  a striker  that was the  biggest thing  I was going  to do in  this fight  was take  a couple  shots  I think  it shocked  everybody  when you  hit a couple  taketowns  people forget  that I have  a big wrestling  background  so I can  wrestle  but  you know  I think  a lot of it  had to do  with the 
[00:49:30]  attitude  wise too  I think  attitude  in the  gym  I gave a lot  of credit  to Sam  Henson  who came in  he's a  great wrestling  coach  and he came  in and helped  me out  with  especially  my training  partners  out with  training partners  started  their intensity  because I think  they were giving  me too much  respect in the  ring when we  were training  I've been  training with  these guys  since I brought  them up  they've been  training with  them for a  long time  and they  started getting  a little bit  taken easy  on me  oh wow  that's something  yeah  so  not necessarily 
[00:50:00]  taking  when I get  tired  I let it  go  there wasn't  that intensity  in the room  that needed  to be  and I forgot  it too  some  but  Sam reminded  me  that I'm  a wrestler  and that  intensity  that I  need  in a room  to be  a champion  what happened  to Mirko  Krokop  we thought  was going  to run  through  and beat  everybody  and he  wound up  getting  beat badly  and he  lost again  that happened  to a lot  of the guys  came in  from pride  I think  it was  because  they were  fighting  the guys  from pride 
[00:50:30]  and they  weren't  fighting  the guys  from UFC  they were  having great  fights over  there  but then  they weren't  they were  getting beat  most of them  got beat  when they  came over  to fight  in the UFC  were they  overconfident  you think  I don't know  if it's  overconfident  I mean  I'm getting  tired of  hearing the  fact that  it's the  difference  between the  cage and  the ring  that's  killing me  I mean  when this  guy's a striker  and he gets  kicked in the  head  and they're  blaming it  on being  a cage  instead of  a ring  you know  he's  fighting a  guy  and it's  oh if  it was  in a 
[00:51:00]  cage  but if  it was  in a  ring  when Forrest  beat  Shogun  if it was  in a ring  how does  that make  that big  a difference  someone said  well  someone  I think  on the  internet  someone told  me  he couldn't  use soccer  kicks  talking about  Vanderlei  I said  at what  point  in that  fight  was he  going to  kick me  was I ever  on the  ground  where he  could pump  me  he didn't  kick you  at all  he was  he was  standing there 
[00:51:30]  going toe  to toe  with you  and I'm  like why  is this  idiot  standing there  trying to  go toe  to toe  with punching  pad  it was  really weird  that he  didn't kick  well I rocked  him early  so a lot  of times  when you get  rocked like  that you just  fight  whatever comes  did you have  any injuries  from the  fight  from the  fight  actually  I think  I cracked  a rib  or something  in the first  round  I think  that's a  man's man  right there  he thinks  he cracked  but he's not  really sure  it hurt  for a couple  weeks  it still hurts  a little  but I started  wrestling full 
[00:52:00]  again  you didn't even  find out for  sure if your  rib was cracked  you're like  well it could be  a crack  rib will say  well he said  it wasn't  displaced so  there's not  much they can  do for it  anyway  well it's  cracked  go ahead  and don't  do anything  they can't  wrap it  there's not  anything you're  going to do  for it  and I didn't  have to train  right away  so  I'm not sure  if we asked  you this  last time  but do guys  try to mess  with you  on the street  like the Tyson  thing  when Tyson  was in his  prime  people wanted  to take him  on  I really  haven't had  that problem 
[00:52:30]  I mean I'm  a pretty laid  back person  as is anyway  and I have  had people  come up  and say  things where  depending on  how I answer  it could probably  turn into one  of those  kind of like  wow  but I kind  of can read  that pretty  quick  and I usually  diffuse it  and I don't  go there's  different things  I could say  to make it  one way or  the other  I was surprised  when I read  about Tyson  that they  would like  try to fight  him on the  street  it's just  people right  after they  wrote a  suicide note  they put it  down  and we're  talking about  Tyson when  he was like  just everyone  was scared  of him  way before  the UFC 
[00:53:00]  and all that  and there  were actually  guys that  wanted to  take this  guy on  when they  were just  saw him  out and  about  yeah I've  never really  understood that  either  but  they figured  they got  nothing to  lose  you know  I mean  I had a  lady the  other night  that said  you know  I almost  wanted to  have you  punch me  in the  face  right now  just so  I could  say  you punched  me  wow  to oblige  you are  the first  girl that  said that  to me  punch me  in the  face  if you  sign all  these  papers  I'll  hit as hard 
[00:53:30]  as you  want  please  how about  if I can  convince my  girlfriend to  say that  to you  could I  call it a  favor  we got  a bunch of  Chuck Liddell  fans calling  today  let's say  hi to Tim  in Rochester  Tim what's  up  hey how you  doing I  just want to  congratulate  Chuck on  whooping  Vanderlei's ass  how long  till you fight  Rampage for  your title  back  I'm hoping  by December  provided he  beats Forrest  Forrest  when's he  fighting Forrest 
[00:54:00]  July I  think  they're doing  the show  they're doing  the next  ultimate fighter  and then  they're going  to fight  after that  I was so  happy to see  you whooped  Vanderlei's ass  congratulations  thanks  a lot of  people were  psyched  dude that  was a  beating  yeah  I mean it  wasn't like  Vanderlei  he fought a  good fight  but it was  it was  it was a  really  just like  two guys  in a  schoolyard  who can  really fight  just duking  it out  I mean it was  just two  bloody guys  punching each  other in the  face  it was really  good man  it was fun  you know I  got back to  doing a lot of  stuff I've done  in the past  I even hit my 
[00:54:30]  spinning back  fist  I worked on  that for this  fight I thought  I could land  it easy  that looks great  when that connects  yeah  oh god  you know  I threw a high  kick  it just didn't  quite catch it  the way I wanted  to but I almost  got it off his  head  yeah  you know I  threw quite a  few things in there  plus obviously  the double legs  too  that back fist  that you threw  and then they  pointed out that  you looked at  the clock a  couple of times  were you like  were you do  that in the ring  like alright  we gotta save a  little bit of  energy here to  make sure I  can protect  myself  he looked  up at the  clock  so I'm like  okay wait 
[00:55:00]  what's he  wait  I wanted to  see if he  was timing  for a certain  sometimes people  try to win  the round  last 30  seconds  so they try  to turn  it on  so I was  making sure  I'm like  wait I'm not  that close  to the end  of the round  okay okay  it's fine  but most of  the time  when I looked  up I think  every time  I looked  up I was  looking off  of him  he'd look  up and  I'd go  okay  give him  quite a  savage  beat  when you  rock somebody  like that  though  what  does it  just go  through your  mind like  okay now  I just  gotta get  in there  and finish 
[00:55:30]  the job  oh yeah  when you  got someone  rock you  gotta get  in there  and put  away  try to  get it  over with  because it  amazes me  sometimes you  see that  happen  and you  see somebody  back off  what the hell  are you doing  get in there  kick his ass  that's me at  the sideline  if I see  one of my  friends hurt  somebody  wait  get on  him  what are  you doing  what are  you circling  around for  he's hurt  you want to  pose a little  bit  look at  I did  Jim T from  you're right  tell you  ask Chuck  about Lee  Murray  kicking Tito's  head off  in a street 
[00:56:00]  fight in  Great Britain  it's an  effing hilarious  story  do you want  to go there  I don't know  I could talk  about it  if you want  I don't even  know what it's  about  well it was a  street fight  in London  right  you know  honestly I  didn't  I actually  didn't  everyone says  I saw it  and I  didn't  I came up  out of this  bar  from downstairs  to come out  of the bar  probably 3.34  in the morning  we were smashed  in dress shoes  so I come up  you know you're in  dress shoes too  so I come up  and I come up  and I look to the  left  I guess Tito was  off to the right  with whatever  was going on  with him 
[00:56:30]  I don't know  what's happened  with Lee Murray  and all that  I don't know  what happened  the only thing  I can say  at the end  of it  if he did  knock his head  off  Tito was  chasing  after Lee  Murray  when the  cop showed  up  so I don't  know  if he did  knock him  down  I mean  he might  if he  cold cocked  him  and knocked  him down  or if he  just hit him  and knocked  him down  you're in  dress shoes  on the street  I mean  dress shoes  on the street  but I don't  know that you  hurt him bad  because he got  up and he  was chasing  after him  so if he  hit him  if you knock 
[00:57:00]  him down  it was a slip  I think  but I didn't  see any of it  I looked to the  left and a  little friend  of mine  was wrestling  was wrestling  with a guy  what the hell's  going on  with you guys  well this guy's  about 145 pounds  had a guy  double leg  up against the  card  got three guys  in the back  hit him in  the back of  the head  so I came  over  pulled the guy  off  it was probably  one of the  funniest things  I've done  though  because I  pulled the guy  off and everyone  was laughing  because a bunch  of USP people  were there  because it was  a UFC  after party  yeah  remind me never  to go to one  of those  what drunk 
[00:57:30]  starts that  fight  it was Lee  Murray's crew  they all fight  they all try  but I throw  one of the guys  off and then  go to throw  another guy  the guy hits  me in the  back of the  head  I turn around  and I go  you mother  take the watch  off  as I'm walking  towards him  put it in my  pocket  that was my  first nice  watch  I was worried  about my  I'm walking  towards him  I'm putting  my watch  off as I'm  walking after  this kid  and then it 
[00:58:00]  was on from  there  the UFC people  were laughing  pretty hard  because I  threw a  spinning back  kick  in the  street fight  they say  I've never  seen that  in a street  fight  I've been  fighting in  the street  for a while  I grew up  that way  it was fun  though  how frightening  is it when  someone's coming  to punch  your face  and you  see them  removing  jewelry  I know  I'm just  going to  kick your  ass  I don't  want to  break my  stuff  doing it  I'm going 
[00:58:30]  to knock  your teeth  out  but first  let me  sink my  iPod  I have a  question too  I don't know  if I asked  this last  time  there was a  wrestler  I saw  you addressed  who is the  wrestler that  was saying  that he  would like  to  I don't  know  if it  was real  or not  was it  Steve  Austin  you said  he's never  been hit  the way  I'll hit  him  what wrestler  were you talking  about  they played  audio for you  on another  radio show  I can't think of  his name right  now  Kurt Angle 
[00:59:00]  keeps talking  Brock Lesnar  is fighting  next weekend  what do you  think of that  from what I  understand  he's been  doing all  the right  things  I don't  know  I haven't  seen him  I haven't  seen him  train  I haven't  seen him  fight  he's been  doing all  the cross  training  he's been  doing the  jiu-jitsu  he's been  doing his  striking  training  and he was  a good  college wrestler  so I think  he's got a  good chance  to make  the transition  if he's  been doing  the right  stuff  like he  says he  has  I think  he should  have no  problem  making  the  transition 
[00:59:30]  Sam  what do  you think  Brock Lesnar  you think  he's going  to do  good  Sam's  very into  wrestling  he was  an animal  when it  came to  fake wrestling  Kurt Angle  is still  like one  of those  guys  that thinks  he can  just come  in there  being a  wrestler  he was  a great  wrestler  he could  just come  in being  a wrestler  and win  fights  it's just  not going  to happen  once you  get a few  in the face  it's all  over  I fought  Randallman  and Randallman  was the  national champ  when I 
[01:00:00]  wrestled  the same  way as  me  in college  and he  didn't get  anywhere  what a minute  18  there's a buzz  surrounding Brock  Lesnar  joining  we'll see  what happens  and what is  it  part of the  pay-per-view  this Saturday  yeah  we should  plug that  really fast  this Saturday  night UFC  81 is on  pay-per-view  and yeah  you got Brock  Lesnar fighting  for the first  time  he's fighting  Frank Mir  that'll be  interesting  Frank Mir  is a guy  that he's  got great  submissions  he's slick  so it'll be 
[01:00:30]  interesting to  see how  Brock does  how many  more years  you got  Chuck  I got a  couple left  at least  well you're  starting to  become a  Hollywood star  too there  you're out  and about  in Hollywood  you're on  Entourage  I have fun  with it  but I still  like fighting  man  and I still  got a few  more people  to beat  there's a line  in the book  where he talks  about and this  is it's amazing  how you look at  genetics and what  makes us different  where Chuck  says something  about if it's  fight or flight  my instinct has  always been to  stay and fight  and it's like I 
[01:01:00]  couldn't have a  more polar  opposite  you're the  runaway guy  there's still  an image  of me there  as I'm  running away  that's how  fast  I can bolt  but it's  very interesting  to me  just that  that mentality  that makes  you have  the ability  or the desire  to like  you like  to fight  people  you like  hitting people  I like  the competition  of it  you know  I've never  been someone  who liked  hurting people  I've never  been that way  I've never  liked hurting  people  but I do  like  see that's  the reason  I'm not  into fighting 
[01:01:30]  and stuff  it's not  the mindset  of me  hurting people  it's me  getting hurt  I just  I've never  liked taking  a punch  to the face  it is one  of the most  unpleasant  things that  can happen  to you  that whole  that ringy  thing  and you  don't quite  know where  you are  it really  sucks  that's when  you realize  you're getting  older  when you get  hit  and you're  like  man this  sucks  I haven't  been hit  in years  but there was  a time  it was  kind of  fun 
[01:02:00]  no  it's never  been fun  to me  I've always  never liked  getting punched  there was a  time it was  fun to punch  someone  it was fun  to get hit  you know  not by someone  like Chuck Liddell  by the way  people more  my speed  you don't want  a life changing  experience  you don't want  a life changing  punch  you're right  but to be in  like a little  street brawl  where you're  getting bruised  up a little bit  and you get  to hit a few  times  it was fun  until you hit  an age  and you get  hit  and you're  like alright  I'm never  doing this  again  this sucks  do you know  alright  anyway  I think it's 
[01:02:30]  just a youth  thing is what  I'm getting at  and eventually  you just grow  out of it  I think  one of the  amazing things  about you  they were  talking about  you during  the fight  and you're  definitely  the most  recognizable  light guy  in the UFC  it's like  you pretty much  even though  they were  fighting before  you're the  face  kind of  of this sport  you're the  guy that  took it  to that level  and how much  of that  all that  pressure  and the  party  and stuff  did that  affect you  in the two  fights  that you lost  was it too  much of  the good  life  I don't 
[01:03:00]  think so  I mean  I think  other things  I mean  training wise  but I  take my  time off  to train  for every  fight  three months  I take  off to train  for every  fight  and you  know  people talk  about me  going out  I mean  I've never  not gone  out  I just  I drink  water  you know  I go  out  I just  want to  be around  people  I'm a  night person  I'm  nocturnal  you know  I don't  like getting  up this  early  yeah  I mean  I don't  get up  before 1030  when I 
[01:03:30]  don't have  anything to  do  you know  when I  have stuff  to do  when I'm  training  I wake  up at  1030  you got a  girlfriend  or you  just  yeah  I got a  girlfriend  oh you do  yeah  here's Bob  Kelly  he came in  just to  meet you  Bob  talk about  polar opposites  this is  physique  polar opposite  yeah  Bob hurry  up because  Chuck's a  busy man  he's got to  leave in a few  minutes  all right  Bob  take care  see you  guys  later  all right  let's  say how  to Paul  Boston  as Bob  goes to  the mic  there 
[01:04:00]  Paul  what's  up  hey  what's  up  boys  quick  question  for Chuck  if you  could  fight  any  celebrity  athlete  musician  actor  anybody  who would  it be  do I have  to limit it  to just  one  no I  don't  know  I  don't  have  anybody  I  dislike  really  he doesn't  have enough  time to  learn enough  wrestling  to make  it interesting  I don't  think he  makes it  interesting  like I've  said for a  long time  people keep  asking me  I got a 
[01:04:30]  135 pounder  mouse to  put him  on his  head and  finish him  in the  first round  I mean  he can't  learn enough  about stopping  a shot  in  I mean  when  how long  is he  going to  practice  wrestling  before  he  switches  over  unless  they  feed  him  somebody  that's  going to  stand  there  and  strike  with  him  that was  the answer  to the question  by the way  we said  about  Maryweather coming  in and you  went like  the laugh  before the answer  was kind of  indicative that it  wasn't going to be  a positive  response  he's great  he's a great  boxer 
[01:05:00]  I mean  this is a  different sport  how long  would it take  you  not to  knock  Tyson  the guy  was one of  the greatest  fighters ever  I think  in his prime  how long  would he  would you  feel comfortable  fighting him  for in a  UFC match  like how long  do you think  he would last  in a UFC  match  not a  traditional  boxing  match  you hit  him with  the same  it's the same  thing  he's a fan  of the sport  and I like  the guy  but you hit  him with  the takedown  right away  no one in  their right  mind is going  to stand  there and  bang with  him  why  give him  his one  shot  tie him  up 
[01:05:30]  take him  down  finish him  I think  it would be  real easy  I mean  for some  I'm not  even like  for any  UFC  fighter  even like  some of  the guys  when you  watch him  boxing  back  when he  was great  the guys  tie him  up  they come  in and  they grab  him  like  bone  grabber  smith  whatever  bone  james  smith  who  are you  the guy  that kept  grabbing  that's how  Lennox  Lewis  beat him  every time  you punch 
[01:06:00]  him  and lean  on his  back  his weight  kept tiring  him out  that's why  I got so  pissed  and he  put his  glove  in Tyson's  face  and it  smelled  like  Christina  Ricci  you got  a question  for Chuck  yeah  I was  actually  I just  watched your  last fight  and I  can't believe  you just  beat the  hell out  of the  axe  murderer  anytime  you beat  somebody  up  called  the  axe  murderer  and I  was wondering  who do you  think they  get you  fighting next  I mean  are you  gonna fight  Jackson  for the  belt  again  is that  your 
[01:06:30]  whole  thing  he's  fighting  for us  if he  beats  for us  then yeah  hopefully  by December  I'll fight  him for the  title  but I'm  gonna fight  somebody  probably  in June  or July  you're  gonna fight  somebody  else  before  you  fight  a lot  well I  try to  I mean  I'm not  getting any  younger  either  I'm trying  to get  as many  fights  as I  can  before  my body  decides  to quit  on me  what do  you  want to  do  after  this  I mean  obviously  you don't  know  but do  you want  to manage  young  fighters  or do  you want  to get  out of  the fight  game 
[01:07:00]  I should  be fine  with  I mean  I should  be fine  just doing  what I  want  but I  will train  guys  for sure  I mean  there's  some guys  I still  I've been  my sparring  partners  and training  partners  for a long  time  and they  got careers  left  I'm gonna  stick around  for those  guys  at least  I can  at least  see those  guys  through  you ever  maybe even  accidentally  just really  rocked  a sparring  partner 
[01:07:30]  yeah  of course  do they  just go  oh my  god  I wasn't  expecting  that  yeah  if that  happens  you can't  that would  be hysterical  you're like  yeah  I'm sparring  with Chuck  I bam  just on  the mat  I have my  training partners  guy wrestlers  especially when I  first started  they put headgear  on  I put the  gloves on  trying to  stop takes  on  stop shots  I had  buddies  I swear to  god  some of  the nicest  friends  wrestled me  from  I drop  one  hit the  ground  they move  him out  of the  way  and then  wake up  and get  in the 
[01:08:00]  back  of line  the next  son of a  bitch  has to  come out  and go  oh jesus  they just  hauled that  last guy  out of here  sorry about that  I learned a little  bit there  you start running  out of training  partners  they stop  coming back  eventually  are you  are you  you do  campbell  karate  right  you a  black belt  in  campbell  karate  yeah  because  I'm a  yellow belt  I actually  made it  for a  coward  I was a  yellow belt  you're two  yellow belts  I actually  did quit  because my 
[01:08:30]  gi split  you know how  hard it is  to make a  gi split  pretty hard  yeah  yeah I  actually  we had to  do our  splits  in the  beginning  of the  session  and my  you just  had to  rip  and  splits  oh god  it was  awful  it was  all you  can eat  buffet  across the  street  it was  either  karate  kempo  or  anyways  when you  throw your  punches  though  you throw  these  you come  like you  have your  hands up  so high  and you  almost come  down at  an angle  sometimes  do you  like practice  something  different 
[01:09:00]  to actually  throw a  harder punch  from a  shorter  distance  I mean  it's all  hips  I mean  you don't  have to  throw  you're not  I mean  I throw  short right  probably harder  than anything  to throw  it's ridiculous  but it's  all hips  in a  body  it's not  it's not  your arms  really  do you  practice  anything  I practice  from all  different angles  we try to  throw punches  from different  angles  and I just  want to  I throw  punches  I just  want to  land them  from any  angle  and it's  hard to  block  when you're  throwing  from all  the different 
[01:09:30]  angles  coming from  different ways  he's standing  there and he  hits you on the  top of the  head  where did that  come from  I always say  you punch  from the  hip  can you  punch  from the  hip  I can't  do it  I try  I just  stand there  my hips  don't move  and I throw  weak little  arm jabs  at the heavy  bag  I saw him  him hit  the heavy  bag  it's like  somebody  actually  getting  molested  and they  just try  to get  the person  off  them  just  flailing  you know  that view  from both  angles  don't you  you really 
[01:10:00]  throw a  knockoff  punch  with words  Jim  we really  got to get  Chuck out  of here  you got a  whole tour  today huh  the book  tour  where are you  going next  actually I  don't even  know  we got some  TV today  very cool  well we're  excited  we're very  excited  the book's  called the  Iceman  it's obviously  about your  fighting your  whole life  my whole life  pretty much  yes Chuck  cool pictures  in there too  definitely  it's really  cool a lot 
[01:10:30]  of times  these books  come out  and they're  not interesting  but this one  every time I  would flip to  a chapter  and start  reading it  it's like  you want  to just  finish the  chapter  there's not  a lot  of fluff  or crap  in it  it's just  a really  interesting  read  if anyone's  going to  write a book  about fighting  it's obviously  going to be  you  it's called  The Iceman  and Chuck  is actually  going to be  doing signings  you're doing  a few of them  a few of them  yeah  it's called  My Fighting Life  I'm sorry man  it just says  Iceman  on the bottom  like a dope  it's called  My Fighting Life  if you go on  Amazon for it  so the signings  are tomorrow 
[01:11:00]  1 o'clock  at Borders  here in New York  100 Broadway  and 7pm  that's how you know  you're famous  when you do  two signings  in a day  two signings  yeah  at bookends  in Ridgewood  New Jersey  I've done a  signing there  it's a great  place  whereabouts  in New Jersey  is that  it's probably  15 minutes  outside the GW  so people that  want to come  in Manhattan  stay in Manhattan  or if you live  in Jersey  just go to bookends  it's perfect  you can do it  if you're from  anywhere in this area  and then of course  it's in Rockaway  so I don't know  where that is  by Dover  well Wednesday  night you're back 
[01:11:30]  in New York  at 6.30pm  at the Virgin Megastore  so you got  three different  chances in the area  to buy My Fighting Life  and Chuck will be  happy to sign  happy might not  be the operative word  but he'll do it  I'll be happy  to sign  and man  congratulations  I'm really really  happy for you  that you wrote the book  and just so happy  to see you win man  thank you  always a pleasure  to have you in man  absolutely  the great Chuck Liddell  everyone  alright we're gonna  take a break  continue with Bob Kelly  and I believe 
[01:12:00]  Nick DiPaolo right  very cool  Opie and Anthony  we're back  it's Opie and Anthony  we got a full house  once again today  every time Chuck Liddell  comes in here  we're just  we look at him  in amazement  because he's a man's man  I mean we all  talk a tough game  but he's the real deal  and he's breathing  heavy into the mic  and none of us  are brave enough  they go wow  what's up with the  breathing heavy  into the mic  like a bull  you wouldn't have to ask  he would sound like  Tony Soprano  huh  you don't have to ask  you know why  he's been hit so many times 
[01:12:30]  yeah  he's been hit a few times  he just sounds like a bull  and he's the nicest guy  you know  he's like  very appreciative  and just really really nice  but you know  he would turn like that  and just kill you  that story that he was telling  outside the bar  just getting in that big brawl  with everybody  imagine just walking by  and seeing that  a bunch of UFC guys  just beating the living  crap out of each other  I'd sit down  and just grab a beer  and watch  oh of course  nothing better than  a good street fight  and then with professionals 
[01:13:00]  doing it  yeah  amazing  best part of that story  is like he was so mad  he took the time  to take his watch off  because he didn't want  his expensive watch damage  in this fight  that he was about to have  he just knew that hand  was going to be  rocking someone's face  and didn't want the  the shock resistant watch  because it's not meant  for that kind of shock  no  it's like getting hit  with a train  well we got Bob Kelly  his stress factory  was great  yeah stress factory  we never get to talk  to the guys  after the big  the big  you know  club dates  it was packed up 
[01:13:30]  Friday night was packed up  Saturday night  both shows sold out  very good  thank you very much  I almost got to a fight  Saturday night  and stop it  actually ONA fans  you can see their eyes  the three  three big  mafioso  soprano dudes  I mean seriously  we were going to go at it  and they actually were like  get the women in the car  and I was like  I was telling them  you know  dude I was like  get the women in the car  I was like  there was one guy  just staring me down  that's what he said  get the women in the car  I gotta like  officially introduce 
[01:14:00]  Nick to Paul  because he's  just chomping at the bit  he's sitting on the couch  over there  now Bob  nothing that would make  Nick happier  than a confrontation  physically with a ex  Nick is beautiful  I've got a couple  but that's it  no  seriously  I'm old now  Nick handles hecklers  the way LaMotta  handled a lippy Vicky  well it's true  but the woman heckler  I'll hit her right in the face  I won't think twice  he was at the cellar  a couple weeks ago  it was the funniest thing  I've ever seen in my life  what happened 
[01:14:30]  when Nick's on  I just go downstairs  because even if he  usually he just kills  but every once in a while  some woman will say something  he'll just snap  which is actually  equally entertaining  as his act  well I self-destruct  down there  I've been there so long  I've been down there  every night for the last  12 years  now I feel like  it's almost my space  and people coming in  like in my living room  it's your house  right  yeah which is wrong  you know  every once in a while  I wish cancer on a woman  so what  I mean 
[01:15:00]  one of my favorite  it's so funny to watch him  go from 0 to 80  for no reason  like there was a girl  the other night  like Nick said something  about being older  and she groaned  and he goes  what what  and she's like  no you don't look old  he goes  ah thank you  it was so  you remember that  you're ready to  fight her head off  she told me  I look like Mitt Romney  oh hey thanks  Jesus  I used to get laid  on the road  now I'm looking like  now I look like a guy  from a you know  toothpaste commercial 
[01:15:30]  in the 50s  he turned the crowd  there's one lady  he said something  about Clinton  and they got all  mad at him  for some reason  he snapped on him  and then somebody  said he  like his  a couple people  on his side  he was like  you guys are on my side  then he just  turned immediately  on them  and said something  funny about  then this lady  this young girl  was like  I like Obama  he was like  why  I think he's cute  and he just  ah if I can say  what he said  to that young girl  well no  we were talking  about Hillary  and I go  yeah why aren't  you gonna find  a nice lump 
[01:16:00]  in her armpit  and this lady  went that's not funny  I go  not if it's  your lump  in your armpit  it's not funny  but you know  then she went  it's like  shut up  I don't want her  to get canned  I was just kidding  but it's funny  we talk about  there was one night  you're on  and there was a woman  in the  like when you're  on stage  she was in the  back right hand  like behind  the comedian seats  in the right hand corner  and you've never  seen a C-bomb  drop  with such  and you're always  there to see it  every night 
[01:16:30]  because it was  so  she had the glasses  she's everything  he hates  and she said  something  objecting to  his Hillary material  and it was not  even an attempt  to banter  go back  yourself  you see  and it was so  it was like  you had been  waiting for a year  to say that to her  and she deserved it  I mean she was  piping up  that time  had nothing to do  with her  she was heckling  I love watching  you guys at the  cellar  because it's such  a weird place  for a comedy club  I mean it's a  great comedy club  and you guys  it's all your  hometown club  obviously  but it's in the  middle of like  NYU  and so many 
[01:17:00]  like hardcore  liberals that  don't know what  funny is half the time  it's on the  campus of NYU  that's why I find  it really interesting  to watch you guys  perform down there  because you'll hear  moans from the crowd  that you won't hear  in any other comedy  club in America  and when you're  talking especially  now politics  people will just  react  but that's why  it's so interesting  well they come in  those kids come in  literally they're  on the campus of NYU  they get that  liberal ideology  pounded into their head 
[01:17:30]  and then I say  the word dyke  and they start crying  and they're all  voting for Obama  yeah well great  I was reading a lot  about Obama  this weekend  all the young  are coming out  and they're voting  like they've never  voted before  it's like a rock band  that gets hot  it's all it is  it's the media  it's just creepy  man  I don't know  but he's got a lot  of foreign policy  experience  and then he played  risk in high school  so I said  are you kidding me  nothing to do  with his skin color  though  he's a seasoned 
[01:18:00]  veteran  absolutely  people are insane  they  he's got no  experience  nothing  no experience  for that job  but  they're pumping  him up  like a rock star  exactly  he's got  you know  and  and all the  guilty white people  want to make it seem  like they're so  open minded  that they go  well  I'll vote for Obama  would you stop  no  you won't  you want to wake up  after the election  and go  okay  now we have an 
[01:18:30]  inexperienced president  in there  because you wanted to  vote for a black guy  let's be honest  that's not what you say  when you woke up  of course not  same thing that people  said when they woke up  after the emancipation  proclamation  was signed  but it's just  I mean  in this whole  it's time for  it's time for  a minority  or a woman  oh is that what we do  it's time  it's time  scroll at the comedy cell  it's time for a woman  so you're going to  vote for somebody  because she pees  out of the same hole  as you do  basically  that's your qualification 
[01:19:00]  can I say that  I don't even know  I don't give a crap  that's it  you're hearing it  somewhere  I don't know the rules  anymore  I haven't been here  for you know  yeah I was telling  Nick off mic  it was a crime  when you know  this station went back  to music  because Nick was  really really doing well  this guy knows  how to do radio  and it's new to you  right  it was yeah  but you were  getting a following  I was listening  and you were very  very  it was a  this is going to  sound so stupid  a breath of fresh air  in this case  thanks man  and that's the last  thing you want to be  well unfortunately  yeah  you know the company 
[01:19:30]  the station general  wasn't doing well  so they had to try  something else  and then unfortunately  that meant  Nick's radio show  went away  oh my god  and I was  just walking in here today  I was literally getting  like I mean  I really loved  doing radio  I was really  I was actually  getting a paycheck  for the first time  in my life  steady pay  and just walking  here today  I was getting  all depressed  and stuff  yeah you don't  want to come here  and watch somebody  with your girl  it's like  watching someone  with your chick  it's like  no this is my show  I was supposed 
[01:20:00]  to be here  that doesn't bother  not exactly  the same feeling  I didn't have a  hard on coming in  you can't say that either  forget what studio  we're in  that's alright  it's a little different  it's not like  there was three black guys  doing the radio show  but you're doing  you're still doing  radio online though  we should plug that  well it's so funny  I'm driving in here  listening to you guys  right  yeah I'm coming in  to plug my  blog talk radio  dot com  slash Nick Dipshow  I'm launching it  today at 4 o'clock  I've done like  a couple test shows  but I'm driving in here

[01:22:30]  they went to a restaurant  next door  said he saw a roach  and decided to come  in here  you know what I mean  and have food here  they were talking  the whole time  one guy  one guy  but it's the mafia  no it wasn't really  the mafia  they looked like  I hope it wasn't  the mafia  you know  they looked like  the mafia  Steve Scharipper  and Stevie Van Zandt  that's exactly  who it looked like  they looked like  the mafia  the guy looked like  Scharipper  I swear to God  oh it's New Jersey  Jesus  yeah come on  they were talking  the whole time  through the middle act 
[01:23:00]  and then when I went up  I let them talk  a little bit  then I went to them  a little bit  then I went back  and then it finally  got to the point  where I was like  dude seriously  shut your face  and uh  and he was just  they were just  looking at me  then they were  getting up  and they started  talking  one guy  just started  just calling me  fatso  and blah blah blah  and I'm like  I'm fat really  would you get that  from my act  I just did like  ten minutes  on me being fat  and we start  then he started  looking at me  like I'm gonna kill you  and he actually  I couldn't believe  he did this  you ever see 
[01:23:30]  the eastern hand  that new Russian movie  that's up for the Oscar  where the guy  he gave me the old  Russian death  with the fingers  in the throat  and then he pointed  to me  oh really  yeah he gave me  the old Russian death  thing with the two  fingers in the throat  and then point them  back at me  which I don't know  what the hell  is that supposed to do  I think he was  pointing at your neck fat  Pelican  what's there a fish  in there  he was going  what's this  he's got a gun  in his neck  it really bugs me

[01:30:00]  that does  it's gotta be  embarrassing  your wife  getting your  old job  like that  you know  that's his  old job  he was president  of the United States  the pinnacle  of the free world  and then  you got your wife  doing it  it's like  come on  it's kind of  emasculating  I think  every time he speaks  she goes down  in the ratings  too  every time she speaks  something happens  I think he's doing it  on purpose  he is  he doesn't do  anything unintentional  he's that good  he really is  did you see him  arguing with that  news guy  for about 15 minutes 
[01:30:30]  he entertained  that argument  he's been a little  cranky since his  heart went in the toilet  you haven't noticed  since that operation  he's a miserable  bastard  he's cranky  what if he's on  blood thinners  and his rods  are not what  they used to be  you'd think that  absolutely  and he's taking it  out on everybody else  finally do what he  wants to do  and it's just  hanging there  like a turnip  and there's no way  he's actually  him and Hillary  have a relationship  no  she looks like  Anthony Hopkins  puppet from magic  she looks like  Fats  Fats 
[01:31:00]  Fats reference  nice  hey Ted in New York  City writes  Obama  somebody got really  mad because you're  making fun of  Obama and his  foreign affairs there  Nick Capala  so then you get  people writing in  and this guy writes  Obama doesn't have  any foreign affairs  experience but does  Giuliani or Romney  yeah he does  stupid  he threw  he threw Arafat  out of Lincoln  Center  that's enough  for me  yeah  he turned down  the 10 million  dollars a Saudi  guy offered us  right after 9-11  he worked as a  district attorney  at the federal  level  he's worked 
[01:31:30]  so yeah he does  he has to deal  when you run  New York City  it's not Burlington  Vermont  you have to deal  with foreign affairs  you know what I'm saying  exactly  I believe with the  UN also  you know you need  to be familiar  with foreign dignitaries  exactly  you know where  they're from  well this guy  continues he writes  those guys are mayors  slash governors of  states in the northeast  Huckabee is a redneck  clown and John McCain's  experience is being  locked up in a foreign  jail somewhere  that's nice  a foreign jail  somewhere  it's a little different  than the Hanoi Hilton  McCain's gone 
[01:32:00]  there's a ton of  committees that deal  with foreign affairs  over this  and everyone's making  a big deal about  Obama winning  South Carolina  like we said  during the break  he was supposed  to win South Carolina  it wasn't Fairbanks  Alaska  you know what I'm saying  people getting all  excited  really  he took a black state  wow  they don't want  to believe  that this is racial  that it's  along racial lines  the voting here  I got the stats  really fast  8 out of 10  blacks voted  for Obama 
[01:32:30]  of course  South Carolina  of course  and a lot of  the young came out  doesn't matter  if it's American Idol  what they're voting on  he got 24%  of the white  he got a lot  he got a chunk  of the white women  though which is surprising  a lot of white women  are starting to go over him  now  which happens in life  the ones with big asses  and bleached blonde hair  they smoked Newport  yeah they did  they did an exit poll  that's right  80% of the wonder  of fat blonde chick  coming out of the laundromat  with a supermodel baby  in their hands  we'll see  we'll see  you ever seen those 
[01:33:00]  mixed babies  the black white babies  they're gorgeous  they're instant supermodels  they got like  great skin color  and big blue eyes  curly nappy  blonde brown hair  but no it's  it's very lightly  like banana curls  you can just make super  it doesn't matter  how ugly  the guy  or the girl is too  he already has abs  just supermodel  comes out  he has chest  he literally  chest muscles  and little shoulder muscles  comes out with a tattoo  it is all 
[01:33:30]  it is all along  racial lines  but it's got  no one wants to think  everyone wants to think  we're so  this country has gotten  so diverse  that we're ready  for a black president  it's not  this country is  anything but diverse  we're so tense  right now  it's like a rubber band  and just  no one has the courage  enough anymore  to speak up  on either side  because you're afraid  you're going to lose  your job  Reverend Al's going to  come out and condemn  you for something stupid  it's ridiculous 
[01:34:00]  Reverend Al  we've had enough  he's on today  he was on today  yeah  because of the cop  shooting in White Plains  yeah  in White Plains  um  I didn't hate  that Mr. O'Reilly  I didn't hope I did  I did  once again  he's outraged  oh Jesus  they haven't even  you know  the cop  they're already implying  that the  we want to know  if the cop  identified himself  as a cop  yeah  no yeah 
[01:34:30]  he did  and they still shot  they shot him  anyway  you're already  asking that question  really  yeah for the rest  of America  a cop got shot  in White Plains  by another cop  yeah by other cops  what was happening  uh somebody stole  a bucket of  popcorn shrimp  out of a  Mount Vernon  whatever  I don't know  who cares anymore  but I just love  they were already  asking that question  he might have  identified himself  as a cop  and they shot him  anyway  they shot him  anyway  why  why would someone  want to throw  their career away 
[01:35:00]  like that  common sense  people  really  I'm not just  going to shoot  another cop  why would you  he apparently  they're saying  he didn't put  his gun down  when they asked  him to  yes  and uh  I kind of  believe that  what was he  doing though  was he firing  he was breaking  up a fight  between a couple  of homeless guys  yep  that's why  you know  what's a homeless  fight  why would you  do that  what else  do they  go at it  fight  it's got to  be survival  of the fittest  the other thing  before we move  on from politics  you got Ted  Kennedy endorsing 
[01:35:30]  Obama  and you got  Carolyn Kennedy  JFK's daughter  there also  endorsing Obama  oh that makes  perfect sense  saying you know  she says that  Obama reminds  her of what  she has heard  her father was  really  yeah  wait  where else  no Obama  reminds her  of her father's  butler  oh my god  how are you man  yeah  Nick DiPaolo  blogtalkradio.com  slash Nick DiP  I like black people 
[01:36:00]  reminds her  how  could she  back that up  with something  because Obama's  getting the  you know  the country  excited  yeah  she certainly  is  I've seen  people really  excited  I heard that  all the  Kennedy's are  back in  Obama  except for  Skakel  he's back  in Hillary  because he wants  to cave her  head in  we all know  where this is  going  with a golf  club  with a golf  after peeking  at her in a  tree  the creep  as soon as I  hit Skakel  on a woman  I could have 
[01:36:30]  just shut up  but I had to  finish it  unbelievable  Skakel  moving on  to other things  you got  the Super Bowl  obviously  Nick you a  Pats fan  you're from  Boston  yes I am  and I'm  46 years old  so I sat  through the  lane days  I was actually  at the Sullivan  Stadium  when it was  crumbling  and you know  watched them  when they were  2 and 12  every year  so I've been  enjoying the last  decade  I'll tell you  that much  any Pats fans  are they worried  about the Giants  at all  I would be 
[01:37:00]  I mean I would  be  you know  it was the  biggest deficit  the Pats had  in the game  when they played  the Giants  and you know  Giants are  playing well  12 and a half  is ridiculous  if you don't  take those  points  seriously  the Giants  have nothing  to lose  they're playing  with house money  the Patriots  if they lose  they lose  everything  a perfect season  that's what's  weird about it  I think  it's so weird  they've actually  put more pressure  on themselves  by going  18 and 0  it's like  so all this  is going to be  for naught  and it's New York 
[01:37:30]  which if New York  does win  it's almost  the Yankees  Red Sox thing  where that's going  to somehow  get mixed up  to do it  like 2004  is going to get  erased for some  reason  come on  let's not get  silly here  slow down  let me ask you  this  let's say the  Pats do lose  right  you're going to  tell me  they weren't  the best team  in football  this year  but they're not  how do you  figure  because they  didn't win  the Super Bowl  I'm just saying  they end up  18 and 1  and the Giants  end up 12  and whatever  it's one game 
[01:38:00]  that's the game  that's what I'm  saying  they put a big  name on it  for the best team  of football  for the whole  2007 season  that's Super Bowl  they put a big  name on it  and everything  but it just  amounts to  these teams  playing one game  you played  all these teams  all year long  we know how it  works  the best of the  best  we understand  how it works  does the better  record get to  move on  Bob  you just said  the internet  was actually  a really good  new thing  shut up  really picking up 
[01:38:30]  you make a point  there though  even if they  lost  they're still  the better team  they're 18 and 1  and the Giants  ended up  14 and 5  Giants had a good  record  the Giants  don't have  pressure  because they  actually got  there  beating Dallas  and Dallas  beating Green Bay  and Green  it's like  Tampa Bay  already  but I mean  on the road  right  they beat  the top teams  in the division  on the road  they won the  last 10 games  on the road  the road games  I know  but it's the  NFC  okay  it's like  it's like  the National League  in baseball 
[01:39:00]  that's true  you know  come on  we'll see  but there's not  yeah but there's no way  we're going to lose  Tom Brady's just too  good looking  he's going to bum me  speaking of him being  good looking  here in the post  today  I mean  they're doing a survey  to figure out  who's sexier  this is the important  part  on the front page  of the post  because you know  there's nothing else  going on in the world  you need this  on the front page  of your paper  who's super sexy  who's sexier  it looks like Tom Brady  that's Cameron  from Thuris Bueller's

[01:41:30]  looks like  his figurine  Tom Brady's body  we were making fun  of this  and now all of a sudden  they're going off  on who's sexier  oh Tom Brady  definitely  you're actually  entertaining this  the back of his  not even his ass  the back of his leg  right below his bum  is gorgeous  I never saw that  I don't know what muscle  that is  but he's got that  great muscle  you've got problems  there Bobby  I hope he has a  port wine stain  on his bag  so they're discussing  who's sexier  in the post today  that's just wonderful  this gives a crap

[01:45:30]  is going to heat up  who is it  Ted Kennedy  for more specifically  let's talk about  New York  here's your front page  of the post  look at the headline  who's afraid of  Brady now  girly man  limps home  you flip inside  they've got the  10 reasons to hate  the Patriots  number uh  number 8  they have the  lamest logo  in the history  of the NFL  number 1  asterisk  etc  how much  at this early  stage in the  Super Bowl hype  do you hate  New York already  Cosmo  well you know  I had liked  the Giants  coming in  the postseason 
[01:46:00]  but I tell you  the annoyance  of the New York  media  and just New York  fans  throws that all  out the window  I'll agree with  the media angle  they're right about  the New York media  yeah  but the fans  are jumping  like five weeks  ago  you talked to  a Giants fan  they hated the  team  Eli's a jerk  and now all of a  sudden  you guys think  Eli's the best  quarterback ever  you're a better  fan  I like Tom Brady  right behind his  ass  that skin on his  leg  I'm a double  sided fan 
[01:46:30]  I like two  things about him  I'd kiss him  so good  can we clarify  that it's Bob  Kelly  I'd kiss him  so good  our fans are  used to it  by now  Bob has to  go homo  he really is  crazy  every time  he's on  like as you  were kissing  him  if he tried  to pull away  would you  hold the head  and just give  him one more  like one more  see you're  doing it like  guy on guy  kissing  I would  slow  I would do  like my bottom  lip  would slowly  like connect  to his lip  when I went  to pull away  it would like 
[01:47:00]  still be connected  and then a little  bit of saliva  would just  and then I'd  pull  you know  you've actually  thought this  out  he really has  and then when  he would try  to speak  I'd put my  finger on his  bum chin  and I'd just be like  shh  dude you're speaking  from memory  you know that  I met him  I told you I met him  oh wonderful  I met him  and I was just  staring at him  sounds like you  banged him  I was in the  locker room  actually  Dane was actually  in the locker room  last week  he actually took  a knee  with the Patriots  as they said  their prayer  well they're all  Dane fans  wait a minute 
[01:47:30]  last week  what during  practice  no two weeks  ago  terrific  he's in  no one's there  he took a knee  with the team  I would have  so what  Karatop's gonna  do it with the  Giants  here's more  from the Boston  fan  and you know  looking at  from their  perspective  the inevitability  of what's coming  here  an embarrassing  defeat in the  biggest game  of the season  it's gonna be  tough to live  with  and that's  the inevitability  they face  an absolute  defeat in the  Super Bowl  so yes  I'm extremely  annoyed  because I hate 
[01:48:00]  New York fans  and I'm fed up  with the New York  media already  after just two  days after the  playoff  it's gonna be  a blowout  Pats are gonna  just blow them  out  you think so  yeah yeah  absolutely  it's weird  really  I don't know  I can't  Eli's been there  what  I mean  that's the thing  Brady's been there  what three  four times  how many  three times  he's won three  and he's been  MVP  Eli  Eli decided to  start playing  football six  weeks ago  stop  they just gotta  go for that  foot  that's what  they gotta do  they gotta start  twisting that  ankle around  just dive for it 
[01:48:30]  he's a great  player but  I don't think  they're gonna  blow him out  it's gonna be  a really close  game  it's gonna be  a field goal  no  I'd say  it'd be about  seven or eight  no way  no way  I mean  the Giants  are gonna  come out  and hammer us  you gotta forget  our defense  he had a stroke  Brewski had a stroke  playing like he had  a stroke  yeah  these guys  are like  you gotta start  tackling people  you get  Seau  retired  you know  they're old  men  Vrabel  they're all  old guys  Seau played  with Red Grange 
[01:49:00]  1966  I'm with you  Seau had a  leather helmet  alright just a  little bit more  from this guy  who is this guy  just some  Boston sports  guy on TV  up there  nobody  on Fox  no one knows  no one cares  we all hate  New York fans  Peter  but already  they've ratcheted  it up a notch  I mean  where is your  hate quotient  at at this  well you know  I lived in New York  for several years  you gotta understand  that if New Yorkers  are ungracious 
[01:49:30]  and obnoxious  in victory  they're even more  obnoxious  in defeat  listen this is  gonna be  one as  Mitt Romney  might say  one heck  of a game  you've got  a team  that has  the sort  of momentum  that the Patriots  once had  and then you  have the Patriots  in a world  championship position  I mean this is  truly to use  a cliche  a clash  of the types  tell us how  you really feel  oh wow  boys  tell you  I hate 
[01:50:00]  I hate  that's every  member of my  family  I lived in  New York  for a while  shut up  that accent's  awful  it's like  first of all  who cares  secondly  don't start  bashing  New York  fans  because  Boston fans  for years  no matter  where you  went  you had to  listen to  Yankees suck  chants  everywhere  if more than  two people  got together  in church  you'd hear  Yankees suck  Yankees suck  so who's  more obnoxious 
[01:50:30]  in defeat  I'd say  Boston fans  absolutely  Boston fans  we're just not  used to it here  let's say hi  yeah we're used  to winning  sorry  so we weren't  very gracious  when we choked  like  I don't even  like bringing  it up  worst choke  ever  worst choke  ever  I'll completely  agree with that  that is the worst  choke ever  they even achieved  that  I don't think  of it  a close second  I don't think  of it as a choke  I just think  of it as a great  comeback by the Redskins  it was both  it was the best  comeback ever 
[01:51:00]  and the biggest  greatest choke  in sports  let's go to  Tony in Jersey  Tony  hey guys  I want to know  what your picks are  I've got to place  my bets  I'm going  Pats all the way  because I'm a Jets fan  which is pissing off  my brothers  out of nowhere  because you know  the whole asterisk  thing  I'm like  I don't  I'm not gonna  I've never liked  the Giants  so why am I  jumping on their  bandwagon  plus we have a little  connection to Boston  and yeah  I want to see the  Pats go all the way  undefeated  right through the  Super Bowl  I take the Giants 
[01:51:30]  by four safeties  ten safeties  yes  it's gonna be  it's gonna be  a ten  to two  victory  five safeties  total  but the Giants  will win  by four safeties  ten two  will be the  final  ten two  that's right  bank on it  ten two  that's right  it's gonna be  a weird weather  situation  in Arizona  yeah it's gonna  rain tampons  all over the field  everyone's gonna  slip  let's say hi  to Alice  Alice  we're heading  toward a break  but what do you

[02:05:30]  while but i don't think  she was legit because it  was a happy ending  i just uh when i when  i was living in la i  was literally i was  talking to myself i was  so lonely and just  nuts i was having i'm  not kidding i was  having arguments with  agents i didn't even  have like in the shower  my wife heard me like  yelling in there i  swear to god i'm not  making this up so i was  seeing some shrink in  uh santa monica for a  little while you really  thought you were having  these conversations or i  was i was talking out 
[02:06:00]  loud to myself to the  point where other  people start hearing  you then you're like  i've done it i've done  it but that's la i'm in  the shower like dude you  can't i yell at you're  rehearsing your i rehearse  speeches i'm worse oh i  rehearse arguments that i  that i'm never gonna have  with anybody oh really oh  yeah this is what i  noticed about bob bob will  do this like you'll start  talking about something  like you know dude and  the way he talks you know  that there's no room for  interjection because he's  practiced so many times  alone but i have both sides  of the story of course you  do because bob just wants 
[02:06:30]  people wants to respect  his intellect he just  wants people to go god  damn it bob i didn't  think of that but no one's  ever said that except for  like technologically where  bob is fairly brilliant  which technologically yeah  you are you're great with  that stuff you have a gift  but anything else it's just  you know yeah politics  friends tell a joke  sociable and how hot is  that stuff hip-hop artists  can do it come on with  those gadgets i kind of get  what you're saying in a  roundabout way i can't wait  till we get on xm all  all right well uh you  should go to fair for 
[02:07:00]  you know dude obama's not  gonna win because the  country's  oh he's had that  conversation just his  stupid awful donald  pleasant's body just  standing there naked in  the shower  who's donald pleasant  i don't even know that  reference  the psychiatrist he was  in the president in  escape from new york  you are the duke of  new york you're a number  one  all missing finger that  that bad 80s guy got it  brain  with a bad guy and with  a stupid blown out  fruity hair and escape 
[02:07:30]  from new york the hell  are you guys talking  about  it was in halloween i'm  still using a rotary  phone i was gonna say  halloween  most know all right hey  we can end this side of  the show with this here  an iowa man got quite an  eyeful when he came home  from walking his dog he  found a man in the buff in  his bathroom  barack  i said there's a guy in my  house  that i don't know  naked  and i said you gotta get  here fast  as soon as i saw he  didn't have any clothes  on i felt pretty  confident  he didn't have a weapon 
[02:08:00]  or anything  he knew he didn't have  a weapon  didn't see it  all right well the  homeowner called 9-1-1  police arrested that  naked guy for an  outstanding warrant  hopefully they gave him  some clothes  maybe he was a  concealed weapon  he was said to be  inherent  or incoherent  possibly  oh i hate the news  more than atrocious  more than  i think you caught it  i think i caught that  i think you got it  i think nick's with us  do you just hate the  news at this point 
[02:08:30]  we were watching the  news today they're doing  jumping jacks on channel  five and they're doing  some kind of like uh  battle of the network  stars on channel 11  for i don't know i don't  even think it was for  super bowl tickets but  some kind of like football  gauntlet that they had  some of their viewers  doing  oh yeah it's like uh  i mean do you notice  tv is tv is like for  women from like six in  the morning till about i  don't know ten at night  then you might what  what yeah because of our  hours i find myself  watching the view and 
[02:09:00]  all this other stuff  because it's the only  stuff on you want to  when you're in your  apartment you kind of  want the tv on and you  realize wow you're right  there's nothing for guys  to watch during the day  and and and they're  coming out more of these  now i don't know that i  watch network primetime  shows but like cashman  mafia and the what's the  other one  lipstick jungle  yeah well we  bob was right on that  one  excuse me  maybe because men are  watching that's it  men are watching the  sopranos the wire i mean  maybe they understand  they can't compete in  like a like a an alpha  male quote-unquote like 
[02:09:30]  mindset on network tv  anymore they just can't  because stuff like you  and rescue me is on  k there's nothing networks  can do maybe lost uh  which is a great show but  most of them can't compete  and they know it so they  just went the other way  and when they try they  get you know caught like  the fcc is finding what  nypd blue yeah four  million dollars i love  that story it's a five  year from from five years  ago girls ass right yeah  they showed a girl's ass  and abc's argument and the  lawsuit is an ass is in a  sexual organ yeah tell it

[02:10:30]  yeah just irrelevant  yeah irrelevant not  representing anybody but  a small despicable religious  constituency and they're  supposed to be the ones  that represent like uh the  majority of the people the  people that uh you know  it's supposed to be if you  say something and and and  even in a certain area like  new york's rules are  supposed to be different  than the south's rules and  the midwest but we're all  under this set of just right  far-right religious crap 
[02:11:00]  which is which doesn't  mirror society whatsoever i  was in a bookstore yesterday  there's a i think it's a  bestseller or something it was  in the bestseller section  some book on just average  people getting kinkier and  kinkier with their sex like  just normal housewives and  just normal just run-of-the-mill  couples are going to you know  uh uh uh uh where patrice goes  oh my god swingers clubs  mcdonald's  my stammer gave you a great

Yeah.  That fucked up the whole beginning of the show.  Yeah.  Hey, CokeLogic got his feedback.  He's like...  Sounds like Peter Frank. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Sounds like a talk box.  Do you feel...  Like we do.  Can I start by saying that I have to apologize to Nick DiPaolo?  We get off the air over there, and I'm like, God, Nick, you did such a great job.  You know, you can come back soon.  Blah, blah, blah.  Would you like to come over to XM?  He's like, yeah, I'd love to.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then we all take off and just leave him there by himself to figure out where we are.  He comes out of the bathroom like a fat chick.  Where is everybody? 
[02:24:00]  We ditched him.  We just ditched him after all the compliments we gave him after the show.  Tim dragged me in there to do some, you know, plug work for your show there.  Yeah.  And then, like, he leaves me with Steve Freed, and I'm like, when does Steve started doing  this?  He's got me over there.  You know, it's like we're doing Shakespeare.  He's like, I'll do it again.  If you don't mind, Nick, can you do that again?  He couldn't be a nicer guy, could he?  Oh, we love Steve.  I know.  Is that that weird one?  Would Ye, or whatever, from the old show.  I'm sorry I slapped his glasses off his face when I left him. 
[02:24:30]  Is that that little mushy, old, weird?  Yeah.  He's been with the company like 50 years.  Oh, forever.  Every Friday, he goes, Steve, have a good weekend.  See you Monday.  And he goes, well, God willing.  God willing.  God willing.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be there Monday.  You can't just say, see you Monday or see you tomorrow.  It's like, well, it's doom and gloom with the guy.  God willing.  It's like you're getting on a bus to New Jersey, not in fucking Israel.  Yeah.  Right.  See you tomorrow.  I hope to.  It would be nice.  I hope to see you, too. 
[02:25:00]  He hasn't grasped polite small talk yet.  No, no.  It's not literal.  It's all about, yeah, there could be a fiery wreck or something on the way home.  Fucking, you know, like there's Evel Knievel on the weekend.  He can make the 60 buses.  God willing.  He probably is.  He's probably having unprotected sex with Haitian hookers.  Exactly.  He does something.  Thanks for the fucking morality reminder every day, motherfucker.  Just say hi.  If you only knew what I did on the weekends, you would understand. 
[02:25:30]  His email is bareback my asshole.  I like to know what his cholesterol is.  He's expecting a fucking stroke.  Like, my wife keeps feeding me sticks of butter.  He does.  He's got the giant gut on him.  He can't hear this, right?  No.  Of course not.  No.  He's done some great radio for us, too.  So, we've kind of reinvented the guy a little bit on our show. 
[02:26:00]  So, sorry, Nick.  I'm glad you found the place, though.  I was happy.  Are you kidding me?  Hey, can I congratulate, by the way, fucking Catherine Hepburn on hanging our Cloverfield poster?  Eric is fucking an incompetent.  What the fuck is that?  Look how badly tilted that is.  And it's on striped wallpaper, so there's no fucking that up.  All you've got to do is line it up with a fucking stripe.  Dude, you incompetent shit.  Can someone just get a photo of that? 
[02:26:30]  Get a photo of how fucking awful that is.  Look at it.  Put a level on it.  And did he hang it for the midgets that do radio after us?  Why is it so low to the ground?  Oh, you suck.  I thought Earl was the worst at hanging pictures.  It's so crooked, it's like reading the Torah.  It goes from right to left.  Yeah, and will the door handle hit it and break the fucking thing?  It's a signed poster.  It's going to, yes.  He hangs it behind a door that opens, and it's crooked, and it's three feet off the ground.  Yes, Steve, take that.  Put it over there.  Can we get a photo of it first? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, it's really fastened, huh?  What a fucking horse's patoot.  Don't take it at an angle.  It'll look straight in the perspective of the camera.  Yeah, take it straight.  Eric, I got a flat screen TV.  Can you help me hang that way?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Eric, what were you thinking, man?  Because I really got it.  What the fuck?  Have you ever hung anything?  Well, it was straight when we put it up, and I had the intern hold the Velcro with the glue.  So apparently it has turned. 
[02:27:30]  It's Velcro.  That's good.  And glue.  You glued a fucking poster to the wall.  It's the only way we're allowed to in here.  Okay.  Yeah.  I got some old stuff that I'm...  Holy shit.  I got something tomorrow that I'm bringing in that's going to look cool in here.  I'm going through all my old boxes.  That is horrible.  Remember the caricatures from our NEW show where it had everybody in the photo?  Yes.  I got that.  It'll be in here tomorrow to be hung up.  Well, where are we going to find room for it?  There's 50 XM signs.  I know.  We get it.  We know where we work.  You know, those XMs are coming down soon. 
[02:28:00]  They should.  Oh, shit.  Who knows?  They're going to be replaced by little doggies.  Did you see anything?  I know.  They don't put the Opie and Anthony name anywhere.  It's on a fucking rug.  No.  Roll it up.  Roll it up with the bodies in it.  Yeah.  And dump it out in the marsh.  Fuckers.  That fucking picture makes me angry at you.  All right.  Well...  Oh, God.  Look, he can't get it off the wall, either.  It's like an episode of Flip This House.  Yeah.  You're going to break it.  Wait.  Come on.  Break.  Please break.  Please break.  What the fuck? 
[02:28:30]  Is it Velcro?  Yeah.  I hope the whole wall just comes out and gets fired.  Good job.  Fat girl's pussy.  There you go.  It's off the wall.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  You couldn't even cut the strips even.  What the fuck?  I'm kind of incompetent pieces of crap.  That's horrendous.  We have to do all that just to hang a dumb poster?  Yeah.  They won't let us do any nails or hoax or anything.  Well, now we understand why.  I mean, you fucking the Velcro.  If it wasn't for that, you'd have two crooked holes in the wall. 
[02:29:00]  My father used to call that something rigged.  That was, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jury rigged, I think it was called.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it.  All to hang a poster for an overrated movie that we were forced to, you know, push.  Oh, wow.  See, I told you.  Plot CC.  Plot CC.  Shut up.  Actually. 
[02:29:30]  TJ actually came to the Comedy Cellar Saturday.  Our buddy TJ Miller.  Yeah.  TJ rocks, man.  He's a good friend of the show.  How was his Letterman appearance?  We didn't get to check that out.  That's it.  Yeah.  I didn't see it either.  I got it on DVR there, so.  I do know fucking Danny did his homework.  What a good boy.  Why?  Why?  Apparently getting stuff offline.  Oh, the Bobby Fischer stuff.  Yes.  Very happy about this.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I got to hear that.  Nick, you know that Jimmy's a big chess guy.  You know that, right?  I did not know that, Jimmy.  I love it.  Jimmy's massively.  He actually reads chess books.  Look at it.  Yeah, I like the players.  Big, me and Bobby, both, man.  Big Fischer fans. 
[02:30:00]  Well, then you're familiar with my favorite porn movie, right?  What's that?  Searching for Bobby's Fischer.  That's an actual title.  That's my favorite one.  Searching for Bobby's Fischer.  Fischer.  That's the best fucking porn title.  I saw that in a hotel room.  I want a cigar.  It was a porn.  That's great.  I can't write that.  I didn't know that, Jimmy.  Well, Fischer is fucking, you know, they say he's one of the greatest players ever.  He didn't have computer aids.  So when these guys do, they analyze their games with computers. 
[02:30:30]  Fischer didn't have that.  So he was all by hand and books.  And he, you know, he fucking, he was a rock star.  He played, he, the Soviet machine of chess was unbeatable.  And in 72, Fischer played Spassky in Reykjavik, Iceland.  And it was, it was so impressive the fact that he fucking, I mean, to non-chess players  this means nothing, but the level of brilliance you need to do this is mind-boggling.  He went through like these, the tournaments to get to the championship and he beat these, 
[02:31:00]  these world-class players six games to nine.  I mean, it's unheard of.  He beat three of them.  Three of them, six games to nine.  Six to nine, six to nine, and then six and a half to two and a half.  He was like an international champion at 14 or 15 years old.  U.S. champion at 14.  Yeah, he beat a guy named Samuel Ruschewski.  That's amazing.  He didn't do that.  But he actually, he was down.  He actually didn't show up for the first match of that tournament.  I lost to my niece in checkers like two weeks ago.  Retarded.  She's 11.  Bobby, I know.  He didn't show up for the first game of a match.  No, he lost the first game. 
[02:31:30]  He lost the first game.  There was one tournament.  And the second one he didn't show up for.  Oh, yeah.  Against Spassky for the world champion.  Yeah, just to fuck him up, right?  He was down two to nothing.  Two to nothing.  Two to the world champion.  But he actually flipped out because he could say he could hear the cameras.  Yeah.  It was being filmed, so he wouldn't show up until they took the cameras out.  That's insane.  The whole point we're going to be making is that he was crazy.  So he dropped out of chess right after that.  In 1975, he was supposed to defend against this guy, Karpov.  How old was he when he dropped out of sight?  I don't know.  Late 20s, maybe?  That's it.  I mean, yeah. 
[02:32:00]  But what else was he going to do with the chess thing?  That was it.  He was a purist.  He was almost divine in the sense that they threw money at him, and he said, this is my  price, and I'll come play.  And they wouldn't do it.  And he literally just was like, all right, go fuck yourself.  And he just was never heard from again.  Until 1992, he played fucking Spassky again in Yugoslavia.  Sounds like Colin, the way he handled his career.  Come on, Quinny.  You don't care.  I'm not going down. 
[02:32:30]  Tell Vinny to go fuck himself.  I'm not going there for seven grand.  Way to go, Colin.  So in 1992, he gets an offer to play the Spassky again.  Just not the real championship.  Gets to rematch for three million.  It's in Yugoslavia.  The U.S. State Department says, do not do it.  There's an embargo on a news conference, he spits on the fucking order from the State  Department, and he does it anyway.  And then anytime anybody ever hears from him after that, he's just trashing the Jews.  I know.  He was.  He's Jewish.  We're Jewish. 
[02:33:00]  Well, then what does that tell you?  Speak.  He was a very angry guy.  I know it's a long, boring setup, but I mean, he was just such an amazing guy.  We got some audio of him ranting, and that's what we're heading to here today.  So let's check this out.  Bobby Fisher talking about the 9-11 attacks.  Yeah.  This is on 9-11, I think.  No?  I'm not sure.  This is the day after.  Was it really?  I think it was the day after 9-11.  He hated the United States.  Yeah.  Here we go.  No?  No.  No?  That is hostile.  Yeah.  Yes, he wouldn't even speak.  He would just be silent. 
[02:33:30]  He just stood there.  He looked signs.  It's very passive aggressive.  He actually, he would hold his breath.  He threw rooks at people.  Let's try this again.  Yeah, right?  Well, this is all wonderful news.  It's time for the f***ing U.S. to get their heads kicked in.  It's a good time to finish off the U.S. once and for all.  They say, death to President Bush, I say, death to the United States.  Wow.  F*** the United States.  F*** the Jews.  The Jews are a criminal people.  They mutilate their children.  They're a murderous criminal, steaming, lying bastard. 
[02:34:00]  They made up the Holocaust as a word of truth to them.  They made up the Holocaust.  Wow.  Yeah, but they're good agents to manage it.  Of course.  And he sounds Jewish as he's saying this, by the way.  Anyone else notice that?  He is very Jewish.  Mutilate their children.  He doesn't like the circumcision thing, huh?  He sounds like a Jew.  They're crazy people.  They're crazy.  The Jews are horrible people.  I'm getting a draft in the middle of the speech.  Shut that window. 
[02:34:30]  They say his father was very OCD.  His father used to carry soap to wash his hands.  So he comes from that place.  Wow.  But so many f***ing geniuses go nuts, man.  He just went nutty.  He did go nuts, but who's out there?  Kasparov used to be the world champion.  But he's actually running for president of Russia right now, right?  He's going against...  He's running for something, political office.  He's running against...  Yeah, I read that.  He's running against...  His hand comes out.  Yeah, well...  Dude!  Dude!  Dude!  He's got his shot because he's respect. 
[02:35:00]  Shut up!  By the way, Fisher, I said this last week.  His real last thing, he took his father's name, Kasparov.  His mother's, I think, last name was Weinstein Kasparov.  Oh, boy.  And Fisher would only refer to him as Weinstein the Jew.  Like, he would never call him Kasparov.  Weinstein the Jew.  Like, Weinstein doesn't say it all anyway.  Just a prick.  The Jew.  Just a prick.  That's like the cop in The Godfather when he goes, what kind of Italian food do they have  in here?  Remember the Italian restaurant?  How's the Italian food? 
[02:35:30]  How's the Italian food here?  You look lusky.  It's all right.  And the Turk's just like, yeah.  Shut up.  Shut up there.  Find a veal that'll take it over the throat, you goose.  Yeah.  We'll see what that food looks like when it's coming out of your throat.  It's not going to matter in an hour.  Little angel hair pasta.  You might want to order the soft polenta.  He's squirting out of the hole in your forehead in six minutes.  Wow.  I was an ugly nerd then.  Now I'm a hot, sexy 10.  Morrie.  Really?  Look at this hoary nation, huh?  What has happened? 
[02:36:00]  Morrie with his...  I can't believe I'm 40, sir.  I'm looking casual today.  Yeah, I guess she's sexy.  All right, here we go.  More Bobby Fisher.  I like her.  My photo album, my letter from President Marcos, my photo album.  With President Marcos, everything.  Uh-huh.  This is just a conspiracy against me by the Jews.  What?  Filthy, filthy bastards, you know, they're trying to take over the world.  What?  They invented the holocaust story. 
[02:36:30]  There was no holocaust of the Jews in World War II.  They've been putting this shit from time in the world about persecution.  They're filthy, lying, bastard people.  That's the way they've ever been.  That's all they'll ever be.  Why do you have this thing about the Jews?  I have no thing.  They have a thing about me.  I'm studying their history.  Really?  Aren't you a Christian?  Yes, I am.  Well, you know, there was a time to go to church.  I've had a church talk for a long time about their jokes about the murder of Christ, huh? 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  All right, very funny.  I'm pissed.  You don't go into my house and take my fucking tapes.  Yeah.  You know, that was personal stuff.  It was never supposed to be aired.  Anthony was talking in his sleep one night.  Wow, does he not like the Jews?  What is this?  No holocaust crap.  What was that?  The Pritikin Diet in 1940?  I'm like, Jesus Christ, what the fuck?  Yeah, the holocaust deniers, that's kind of... 
[02:37:30]  It doesn't matter how anti-Jew you are.  You've got to kind of fess up to the fact that that happened.  Yeah, there's some documentation there.  Just a little bit.  What the fuck?  They know it.  They know it deep down.  It's like Ahmadinejad.  He's just saying, well, it's just their way of jamming their middle finger up at the Jews.  They really know it gets to them.  He sounds like he believes it, though, Fisher.  He really sounds like it.  Wow.  Yeah, maybe somewhere he does.  I don't know.  He said that they stole all his...  He had all his stuff in storage, and it was sold off. 
[02:38:00]  Which, again, he seems like a guy who is reacting to having probably been wronged,  but he just went...  He couldn't control it.  He's just like, again, like so many fucking geniuses.  He just spiraled, and that was it, man.  He was too brilliant.  And I'm not saying what he was saying was brilliant as far as being accurate,  but that fucking mind...  Thank God E-Rock never has to worry about that happening.  No, he's a goldfish.  You can slap his face, and five minutes later he comes over and asks you,  why does my face hurt?  I'm afraid now I'll put Tony Danza. 
[02:38:30]  Tony Danza.  Jesus.  We got another clip here.  I hope it's a better quality.  Well, in this clip he discusses that the dirty Jews are thieves and motherfuckers.  All kinds of stuff, fertile albums, statues, the works.  I have sold every fucking thing and sold it off.  The dirty Jews, they want to put me in prison for 10 years,  they have sold all of my general opinion, which I've collected over the years, 
[02:39:00]  they have confiscated, they have stolen my book, my 60 member of the games,  they've come out with an illegal movie called Churching for Bobby Fischer,  which is exploiting my loan for money.  They've made tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars on this movie.  I know they give us a penny of it.  And they came out with an illegal, the Jews are coming out with an illegal CD round called  Bobby Fischer, Jesus said,  he's sold for me.  I get nothing, even for your legitimate edition of my 60 member of the games.  Nothing.  These fucking Jews are thieves, they are liars, they are motherfuckers, 
[02:39:30]  and a party who took care of these bastards.  Sounds like a meeting for the writer's guilt strike in there.  Oh my God.  It's hard to hear, but you certainly pick up on keywords.  Wow.  Where did you get that up?  The guy's got it.  And there's other interviews that are just the same thing.  And finally, he talks about the fact there was no Holocaust, the last clip.  Oh, okay.  There was no Holocaust. 
[02:40:00]  The Jews are liars.  It's time we took off the two gloves with these parasites.  What?  With all of the things, Mr. Fischer, what do you need them to do now?  I am told to do what I'm doing right now.  What?  Which is to expose the Jews for the criminals they are,  the parasites they are,  the liars they are,  the thieves they are,  the murderers they are.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  That is an angry man.  Anyone for chess? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, really.  I know.  After listening to that, you're like, how could he be good at chess?  Right.  He's a little impatient.  He's going to lose.  Right.  You know what I mean?  He's got to have a little patience to play chess.  Well, he was actually mad like that back then, though.  Just not towards the Jews.  He actually...  He hid the Russians.  Yeah, he hid the Russians, and actually, he wasn't going to play the game.  He wasn't going to go and play Spassky.  And then, I think the president or somebody called him in and said,  look, you go do this for America.  And he was like, you got it.  And he actually went.  Wow, he changed his view since then, huh? 
[02:41:00]  He was really patriotic and went there.  You do it for Israel.  Okay.  Oh, 32.  We'll plant a tree for you.  They flew him.  It's funny, because they had planes waiting for him.  And they gave him the whole first row of first class.  They were like, because he likes fresh-squeezed orange juice.  So, they would have, like, orange juice things to squeeze orange juice.  He was just...  He was Jewish, Jimmy?  His mother was Jewish, and they said recently his father was Jewish, too.  Oh, my God.  So, I didn't think it was self-hatred.  I think that he was legitimately wronged at times. 
[02:41:30]  It's almost like having a girl cheat on you,  and then you just go on this rant about how all fucking women are cunts,  and you try to prove it.  That's, like, that irrational, you know.  I wish you didn't use that example.  Yeah, where's the irrational?  Let me correct myself.  Yeah, none of us relate to that.  Oh, shit.  He's just great.  Watching some good old days footage.  Ixnay, Ixnay. 
[02:42:00]  Wow.  Wow.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  That was hilarious.  It was, yeah.  There's a lot of weird stuff on TV right now.  The guy getting saved from the ice is just creepy.  Oh, he's a snatch from the ice.  He's a crybaby.  Oh, I keep missing it.  You'll be seeing this video all day today.  Oh, Weymouth, Massachusetts?  He's yelling, hurry!  Hurry!  Ah!  Look at him going under.  I thought this ice was hard!  The fucking Jews!  They put ice!  They made the water cold so I'd fall in! 
[02:42:30]  Look at this stupid bastard.  Dummy.  What's he doing out there?  Don't ever put me on the news if I'm wrapped up in a gurney.  You know?  And you're fine.  You're sitting up and talking.  You never want to...  What was he doing?  Three in the morning.  He's walking out on the ice.  Probably hammered.  Spray painting a Patriots lover on the ice.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking hammered.  Bobby, give me the blue, Bobby.  That's probably exactly what was happening.  Where's Kenny? 
[02:43:00]  Why?  What happened to me?  Oh, no.  You got something wrong?  Oh, boy.  No, I got obese food.  Did you?  Give me my food.  Where's Kat?  I'm starving.  Where's my smoothie?  I don't mean to sound like a rookie, but can I get pictures and stuff while we're doing this?  Of course.  Can you have Eric take some?  Sure.  I got to do this to the bakers.  They'll be all crooked pictures.  You'll have to run it through Photoshop.  Exactly.  Straighten them out.  That's the top of your head.  Hey, how come I'm laying down?  Wait, what's the plug again? 
[02:43:30]  Blogtalkradio.com slash...  Nickdip.  Nickdip.  Yeah, blogtalkradio.com slash Nickdip.  Thanks.  Four o'clock today.  Yeah, four o'clock.  Well, this is my food, so...  Oh, you know what?  I was wrong.  I apologize.  Give me that.  Oh, now this is mine.  The fuck are you guys eating?  Eggs.  Look at this.  It's like a...  What is it, Japanese stuff?  It's reading food, Anthony.  You should try it.  No, it's...  You should try it.  Oh, no, it's an actual...  I eat when I get home.  I've never seen you eat anything.  I believe...  I think they actually made you.  They put you back together. 
[02:44:00]  I eat when I get home.  You just sip seltzer and...  And he eats a bagel.  He's good.  I have a bagel and...  I've never seen him eat anything.  And then when I get home, it's chicken and then...  Chicken.  Chicken.  Chicken.  Just chicken.  Boiled chicken.  Anthony's very healthy.  Asparagus.  All right, we're going to eat.  So let's take a break.  Broccoli.  More with Bob Kelly and Nick DiPaolo.  Hey, Nick, you tell...  Somebody said you got to tell the story of punching off the heckler.  Which one?  Which one?  We're going to get into Nick's psyche after the break.  Was that from Seattle, that email? 
[02:44:30]  I don't know.  Somebody called and hung up.  Was it a Jew?  Maybe they'll call back.  We'll see.  It never happened.  He was making it up.  We'll see what story he's referring to.  They're practicing being cruel and unusual.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio program. 
[02:45:00]  We're having a bang up time here.  A lot of laughs, a lot of high-fiving.  I have food in my mouth.  So there's Opie.  Anthony's wearing his parka.  Well, I just drank my smoothie and it was chilly.  Oh, sweetie.  Like anyone gives a flying fuck.  Oh, I don't know.  Bob is texting.  What are you looking at, Bob?  I'm texting my masseuse slash trainer, Bill.  That's a masseuse, not masseuse.  No, it's a masseuse.  Bill?  Trust me.  Hello, Bill. 
[02:45:30]  It's a masseuse.  I hope your masseuse finds you like Heath Ledger.  Yes, exactly.  I was trying to think of it.  Isn't that your worst nightmare?  Somebody finds you unconscious and the first person they call is an Olsen twin?  Fucking Jesus Christ.  Take your jacket off, Anthony.  Let me call my security guards.  I think they know CPI.  Yeah.  How about 911?  Jesus.  The guy might have had a chance.  Take your jacket off.  You look like you're in a Stephen King novel.  What?  Take it off.  You're making me hot.  All right. 
[02:46:00]  I'll take it off in a few minutes.  I'm cold.  I drank a smoothie.  You're drinking coffee.  You're such a fucking yenta.  Listen.  I'm cold.  Phil did call back.  We started talking to Nick about his issues of attacking, like, you know, people coming  to see his show.  I've never attacked anybody.  I know.  And then Jimmy said, just save it for the air because this is too good.  But let's start with Phil in Atlanta.  Phil, what's up?  Hey, Nick. 
[02:46:30]  What's up, Billy?  Every time Jim brings you up occasionally, he says you have a slight temper problem.  Go.  What the fuck are you talking about, Jim?  No.  No.  I just can't tolerate, after 20 years, stand-up comedy's been around long enough in comedy  clubs where the audience should know you don't fucking keep, and I don't mind heckling,  that's one thing, but just to be fucking loud amongst yourselves and take out your fucking  cell phone and chat and just be, that fucking arrogant attitude. 
[02:47:00]  And these people, you know, they sit three feet from the stage and they talk at this  level like this.  How are the chicken fingers, honey?  And then when you call him on it, the rest of the audience goes, oh, he's a dick.  Fuck you.  And fuck the guy eating the chicken fingers.  Yeah, heckling's one thing.  You don't mind a heckling.  No, that's part of that.  But even this guy this weekend at the Stress Factory, he wasn't talking to me, he was talking  to his dumb friend the whole time and repeating my jokes.  It's like, dude, if you're not even going to engage me, and then I tried to engage him 
[02:47:30]  and he wouldn't.  Yeah.  Then they, yeah.  Yeah, he shuts down.  It's like, what'd you say?  And they don't answer you.  Now you're not even giving me a friggin' opportunity to make it funny, you fucking fat Italian piece  of shit.  Well, Nick was telling the story of going toe-to-toe with some guy in Boston, was it?  Giggles or something?  Well, yeah, Giggles.  I've had two physical altercations my whole life, and they've both been at clubs called  Giggles.  Totally unrelated.  One on the East Coast, one on the West Coast.  Gotta stay away from Giggles.  Yeah, apparently.  I should have fucking just the name alone. 
[02:48:00]  Put that on your resume.  But yeah, I was outside of Boston.  Lenny Clark's brother owns a place called Giggles.  And I get up there and I go, I live in New York now.  Yankees suck!  I go, okay, sir, anyways.  So yeah, I was living in New York.  Yankees suck!  And he keeps doing it.  Before I can even tell my first fucking joke.  So who's the asshole already?  Laughing probably.  Hey, look at me.  See, look, I'm disturbing the show.  I love those people that are with their friends or something. 
[02:48:30]  It's like, look at me.  I'm getting my line out.  Shut the fuck up.  And then this guy, he's with two fat broads.  And they start talking, giving me the finger during the show.  You know?  And there was no door, man.  It can be quelled in a second if they have security.  Yeah, yeah.  But nobody's around.  And it keeps going on.  And they're ruining the fucking...  Finally!  Somebody like the owner comes in or whatever.  He's making pizza in the back.  Again, not a gig you want to...  So...  It is a pizza place slash comedy club.  It's great, too, actually.  Great pizza. 
[02:49:00]  So anyways, he comes in finally and asks these people to leave.  And I'm fucking...  At this point, I'm fucking furious because it's ruined the set.  And the stage is at ground level.  It's not like you're up.  You're on the same level as the audience.  And they have to walk by me now to get out.  And I'm like, if these fucking guys...  Any of them, even the girls, look at me wrong.  I'm going to poke them in the fucking eyes.  Of course, they go by me, the girl.  And he's coming.  He's trailing.  The kid.  The guy's trailing about a few feet behind him.  And sure enough, he gets to like... 
[02:49:30]  He starts to point at me.  And I just fucking leapt off the stick.  Lenny Clark comes around the corner.  He sees me literally in...  I remember I was in mid-air.  Lenny goes, Nicky, no!  And Lenny tackles.  Lenny was about 350 at the time.  He tackles me and this kid.  It was like a hockey fight.  We had each other by the shirts.  And we're just exchanging shots.  And Lenny tackles us.  We knock over like three...  It was like a country and western.  The shelves are breaking.  Mugs are sliding off the shelves.  Like Hooper.  Other people are jumping in. 
[02:50:00]  Stupid Hooper.  And then we get back to our feet.  We got back to our feet.  And we're still going at it.  After everybody...  We're at the bottom of the pile hitting each other.  And it was just...  And next thing you know, you know, the cops pull into the parking lot.  I got to do another...  Lenny comes on the stage.  Here's Lenny.  Lenny comes on the stage after the fight, right?  The place is still buzzing.  Lenny goes, Nick DiPaolo!  You got a minute?  He puts on a hell of a shot.  And then the cops...  The guy in the kitchen, the cook came out and picked me up.  I was still...  Me and this guy was still trying to get it.  Big fucking Italian. 
[02:50:30]  Picks me up.  I like...  You know, carries me.  I'm kicking my feet like a little girl.  Carries me into the kitchen.  To top me down.  And these people follow him in the kitchen.  And he's still yelling at me.  What other form of entertainment does the audience actually trade fucking blows with the entertainer?  What other form of entertainment?  You don't see...  You don't see Wayne Newton fucking mix it up.  He's fucking...  Donka Shane.  Darling.  Hey, what the fuck?  Bam, bam.  And just duking it out.  But you know why that is?  But that's a good point, Andy. 
[02:51:00]  Because...  And I know...  Stand-up comedy...  I remember Seinfeld saying this in a book.  And he hit it right on the fucking head.  And everybody has made somebody laugh in their lifetime.  So they think they can do what we fucking do.  You know, you don't go to the opera and go, that guy, he sucks.  Because, you know, I sing...  Yeah, dude.  You don't heckle a band.  Because nobody's going to try to play guitar.  I mean...  So they think, you know, this guy's doing...  I could do this shit.  But I'd rather work at the mattress factory than slow-moxing off.  They tell me...  Everyone down there tells me I'm funny. 
[02:51:30]  That's the mentality.  Yeah.  So there's a lack of respect when they come in.  Especially for guys.  And you can pick the guys out who fucking...  And you can tell they just...  They stare at you like a psycho the whole show.  You can tell they want to be comics.  It's been eaten away at them.  They're miserable at whatever they're doing.  Yeah.  And that usually stems from it.  But, you know...  Oh, wow.  That's fucked up.  They talk over your joke.  They just keep talking.  So you'll say something funny.  They'll laugh.  But then they'll start talking to you like it's just you and him. 
[02:52:00]  And you're doing a show for him.  And he's talking over your next joke.  And you're like, dude, shut the fuck up.  And they laugh.  Because they think you're still kidding with them.  What about the people that are talking during your shit?  And then they don't fucking hear a word.  And then you suck.  That's right.  You're not funny.  You're not...  Maybe you weren't fucking listening.  And this is the worst part.  Is when it's one person you actually call them out.  They will try to pollute the rest of the table.  And everybody around them. 
[02:52:30]  They want to spread their fuck you.  This guy sucks to everybody.  Yeah.  By getting on their phone or just pouting.  And now her girlfriend or his girlfriend won't laugh.  Because he's not laughing.  Yeah.  And then the whole table is just like uncomfortable.  And then it's just this fucked up energy.  I don't know how you do it.  The fight I had in Seattle wasn't as much of a fight.  But this was really interesting.  Because now me and the kid are like friends.  Oh, really?  He fucking found me on the internet.  Oh, shit.  But he...  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  So we got into this whatever.  You know.  Same fucking thing.  And just like a little bit of a wrestling match.  But here's the thing.  They throw him out.  I go back on stage.  Right?  And the place is...  I'm embarrassed.  This is what stand-up...  It's embarrassing.  I got a fucking ripped shirt.  I got guacamole on my pants.  Yeah.  I'm fucking 40 years old.  This is what I'm...  I want to talk politics.  This is what...  It's just fucking horrible.  And the crowd's chanting.  Like, fuck, Nick, Nick.  Like, it's the Jerry Springer show.  Because that's what they fucking want.  They throw this kid out.  I go back on stage.  I go back into my act for about five minutes. 
[02:53:30]  All of a sudden, the side exit opens.  And this kid comes in the side exit that they had thrown out.  And he fucking picks two glasses up and throws them at my head.  Holy shit.  I get it at home on tape.  He was pissed.  Yeah, he threw two glasses at my fucking head.  So a table of guys gets up, young guys, and chases this kid out the fucking side exit.  About 10 minutes later, we hear an ambulance.  They busted his leg.  Holy shit.  They busted his leg.  And now I know the story.  I didn't hear from the kid for about eight months. 
[02:54:00]  So all of a sudden, I get an email on MySpace.  It says, Northwest Madman.  And I'm like, oh, I know who the fuck this is.  And he explains a whole story to me that they busted his, like, femur.  He went into shock in the ambulance and almost fucking died.  He's got a metal rod in his leg.  A little memory.  A year and a half of work.  You know?  And I'm like, I didn't want that thing.  Wow.  Not harsh enough as far as I'm concerned.  You're not one out.  That's what you get for talking during the show.  It should happen to all of them.  Fucking audience have pitchforks and torches. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, my God.  Chasing people down the street.  But he fucking, what did he say in his email?  Like, hey, man, that was, you know, he thought it wasn't your fault.  No, but he's still like, hey, yeah, you better not, you're lucky security broken up.  And I'm like, oh, you mean the fucking four-foot-eight guy that owns the place?  You know, literally.  I'm like, yeah.  But I just, I just, it's so weird.  This is why my wife's the best.  The week before I went out there, she goes, we have to incorporate you. 
[02:55:00]  And I'm like, why?  What the fuck?  Well, if you ever get sued or something, man.  And I go, what are you talking about?  Why would I get sued in a fucking comedy club?  And this is literally eight or nine days before I went to Seattle and getting the fucking,  getting the beef with this.  It was a big lawsuit, obviously.  Who would get sued?  Like, you know, your incorporation, sock them, cunt moms.  Well, they, yeah, they can't go after your home and your personal shit if you're a company  or whatever the fuck.  But he, so he, but this, yeah, so I don't have, this kid was on the radio, this kid, Jason. 
[02:55:30]  He's actually, I mean, you know, we email each other all the time now.  He won't let it go, you know.  It's like, fucking.  And I'm like, dude, let it fucking go.  He's got to come up every time you talk to him.  All right.  He's full.  Every time he goes to an airport security, he thinks of you.  Oh, he's got to.  So, uh, well, I just, a matter of fact, he sent me some video clip of him last week.  He's doing the radio out in Seattle with Voss.  Voss was out there last week or somewhere.  So it was rich and this kid, he's trying to do comedy now, this kid. 
[02:56:00]  See, that's exactly why he saw you.  But he's got, you know, he's got like a, he's got a little daughter and he's, he's like  a nice kid.  It was one of those things, fucking boo-fueled and, but he, he's not going to fucking let  it go.  I got, I told a story once with David Tell when I was down at the cellar and I, I know  how to act in a comedy club.  I've been around comics long enough.  I know.  You're very chatty.  I'm not.  I'm very chatty.  Yeah, right.  Extremely.  I, I would never, I would never.  You and your carafe of wine. 
[02:56:30]  I don't do that.  Sit there and the people at my table know not to fucking do that.  They just know.  So I'm sitting watching a, a tell and the table behind us were yapping like fucking crazy.  Bet, bet, bet.  Wouldn't shut the fuck up.  A tell turns around to my table and starts going, would you fucking shut up?  Why do you insist on talking during my act?  I'm trying to, and I'm sitting there fucking blindsided and then I'm trying to make an  excuse, I go, it wasn't me. 
[02:57:00]  He's like, bullshit, it wasn't fucking you, motherfucker.  And just unloaded on me.  And I'm like.  A tell?  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  A tell just fucking unloaded.  And then he finally comes on the show and I'm like, good, now I can address it.  Yeah.  So I tell him what happened.  He goes, fuck, collateral damage.  What are you going to do?  Collateral damage.  I've done that.  I've done that.  I did that to an ONA fan and his girl.  So he actually brought this girl, he was a big fan of me and the show, and he brought  this girl down to impress her, to the comedy cellar. 
[02:57:30]  Holy shit, she must have been a big fan.  She's actually a really hot blonde chick, which annoyed me.  She was something else.  She, I said some word, I was doing like this new joke and I said a word and I didn't get  it out correctly.  Oh, of course you didn't.  And I heard her, I heard her say the word correctly, like, you idiot.  And I fucking, I was like, you fucking cunt.  I didn't know that word.  Oh, just all my childhood fucking issues came out on this fucking dumb broad. 
[02:58:00]  And he's like.  That's the reaction he's used to.  That's what all the rehearsing is.  That's what.  Dang, you know.  The country's not ready for a word.  Just once.  He doesn't want to be corrected in a humiliating fashion.  Sorry, Bob, go.  Thanks.  Anyways, this poor guy was like, dude, I came to see you, bro.  I brought her to see you.  What the fuck?  She just corrected a word.  It wasn't even a big deal.  I fucking lost it.  I was like, go fuck yourself.  You and your fucking two parents, you fucking dumb cunt. 
[02:58:30]  You and your two parents.  You fucking liberal.  What do you do for work?  She was like, I, this kind of bugged me.  She goes, I help sick kids.  I go, what?  Like, there's a fucking badger on it, you fucking.  I was just calling her a cunt, cunt, cunt.  But that's unnecessary, Bob.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  But it's almost like sometimes you, you, you, you just, you, it's just built up waiting  to come out.  Well, yeah.  And it comes out.  Sometimes you fuck up and you slam, you go a little too far.  You slam the wrong person. 
[02:59:00]  And, you know.  My best line was, I said to a girl in Comedy Village while I used to be Boston Comedy.  I said, I hope you have a baby and it dies.  I hope you look, I go, the second day you have it, you look in the diaper and it's filled  with blood.  And even the other comedians get all quiet.  Even like Louis C.K. was like, holy shit.  You get Louis C.K. going, holy shit.  That's fucking great, man.  Norton does the best thing.  Love that.  Norton will, if, if a crowd goes against Norton or they don't like his act because 
[02:59:30]  they'll ooh and ah him, he will get as filthy and disgusting as he can possibly get and derail  the whole, with a fucking smirk on his face.  And spit on the stage.  Oh, yeah.  We've all seen that.  Yeah, I do spit on the stage.  It's really an annoying habit.  I should not do that.  And then he'll go, you guys have been great.  And then spits and walks off the stage.  Like Richie Aprile.  Esty saw me spit one time on the stage.  I can't help it.  I hate when they think that I was having fun when I wasn't. 
[03:00:00]  And Esty saw me spit on the stage.  Like as I'm walking off, I was like, and she looked, the look was like, what the fuck  did you just do?  It was like La Mata in the living room.  What, you want to fight in the rain?  He spits on his own stage.  Hey, Jim from somewhere, he says, Nick verbally smashed a very liberal crowd.  Okay, in D.C. last year, very uncomfortable, very racist, very funny.  Do you remember that one, Nick? 
[03:00:30]  Very racist.  You can't, see, if it was really racist, it wouldn't be funny.  You found it funny because deep down, you know, I was fucking kidding.  I hope, Jim.  But no, I don't remember doing anything, you know, extraordinary in D.C.  I thought it was kind of.  Probably just a regular night for you.  Just a regular night.  And, you know, if you're in D.C.  That's a good point, though.  When you're doing it long enough, we don't have the same barometer as somebody comes off  the street and watch a comedy.  Are you self-destructive?  On stage at the comedy cellar, I am. 
[03:01:00]  Because, like I said, I've been down there.  You're on the same stage every night for 15 years.  You feel like it's your living room.  And these fucking people are intruding on you.  On you.  Yeah, I mean.  I'm hosting you here, motherfuckers.  Yeah, and you get bored.  You might get bored, so you kind of dig a hole for yourself to make it interesting.  But I've been, like, doing it too often lately.  But you know what?  I got reprimanded, finally.  They sat down with me.  It was a two-second conversation.  And I went.  I didn't even argue with them.  I go, look, I leave here some nights not feeling good about what I said to people. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, wow.  And they love me.  I mean, come on.  They've been.  Manny loved me.  You know, Gnomes dead.  But he handled it perfectly.  He goes, look.  He goes, they're all afraid to talk to you.  Let me just talk to you.  You're making it very difficult on us.  And I know what he means.  He's probably getting emails of people calling going.  I got a letter.  Estee showed me a letter one time.  He said Jew.  I think Estee showed me a letter that they got about you one time.  And I howled reading it.  Uh-oh.  It was a long two years ago.  I'm afraid to read it.  No, it's very funny.  But Gnomes, I like these people. 
[03:02:00]  And I don't want to make it hard on them, you know?  You do forget, though.  You get so comfortable in a room you've been in so much.  Yeah.  But I just said to Gnomes, you know what?  I go, don't say another word.  Because, like I said, I know there's time when I leave here.  I'm like, I shouldn't have fucking done that.  Really?  Yeah.  But sometimes you get, you know, I have a few of those.  Beer balls.  It used to lighten you up.  It used to lighten my mood.  But sometimes it has a reversal.  You know what I mean?  It makes you a little angry.  Yeah.  If you're a little nasty before you have a cocktail.  Absolutely.  If I'm going out and I'm in a good mood and I have a couple of drinks, right away you're 
[03:02:30]  like in a real good mood.  Talkative.  Smiling.  If you're in a pissy mood, you'll have a couple of beers and just be like, you motherfucker.  Yeah.  A little more pissy.  It exacerbates it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right, Jimmy?  Very hard to turn a pissy mood into a good mood through drink.  It usually just stays pissy.  But it helps.  Dude, it exacerbates it.  It helps me.  It exacerbates it. 
[03:03:00]  Exacerbate.  Shut up, cunt.  I wish I remember the word.  But it helped me that Noam said that.  And then I did four sets down there this weekend.  You were all right.  Yeah, it was fine.  Maybe I needed to hear it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like a little kid.  Sometimes, yeah.  Right?  You've got to hear it.  We're going to change gears.  Pat Duffy found us.  How's your news clips?  We haven't done this in a while.  Oh, is this the retards doing the news?  Yeah.  Well, guys, let's just be careful with this one.  Oh, really?  This young gentleman, this young journalist, talks about Texas. 
[03:03:30]  They're not journalists.  He's not a real journalist.  They took...  This young go-getter talks about Texas in this clip.  Go get that chromosome.  How many times does he say Texas?  This is Sean Michael Castile again from Texas.  Texas is a wonderful place to go home.  There's a good place to have cowboys, boots, guns, and hats. 
[03:04:00]  What kind of news is that?  That's not news.  Who's that helping?  No one.  He's telling people about Texas.  Exactly.  You should wear boots and hats.  You should tell people.  Did they dress him up like that when you said howdy?  I bet they did.  Oh, sure they did.  With that mongoloid hairdo coming out from under that cowboy hat.  He should tell people how different coins taste. 
[03:04:30]  A quarter leaves more of an aftertaste than a nickel, which is a nice addition to a penny  spritzer.  Thank you, Dumbello.  Put that fucking pneumatic bolt against his head and let it fly.  Here's what the cows do.  Hey, why is...  Why is Edwards still in the race?  I don't know.  He's taking away votes from Hillary.  Yeah, he actually got excited, I guess, South Carolina, because he got a lot of the white 
[03:05:00]  whoever...  The white older vote.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  Barack Obama.  He's going to win Colorado?  See, I don't like the whole change thing.  You know, he's like, hey, it's time for change, because I know what that means.  Well, exactly.  Exactly.  That's the change that we aren't going to be privy to.  I liked when Whitey was in charge.  Yeah, what kind of fucking change now?  What kind of change?  Because this whole thing is based on this big change.  And the change is that there'll be a black guy in charge, and that he'll put other black 
[03:05:30]  guys in charge, and a black America will feel, I think they'll have this delusion.  Of empowerment.  When, you know, the impoverished is still going to have nothing, but there's going to be  this attitude that, hey, one of our guys is in the office now, so we can do whatever  we want.  Where'd you get that idea, huh?  I know.  Yeah.  They're not exactly shrinking violets right now.  You know what I mean?  No, I thought that in the car on the way here. 
[03:06:00]  I know.  I'm like, they watch TV like Springer, and they see black guys fucking white girls, and  they start buying it to their own press clipping.  I can imagine you put a guy in the fucking White House.  Guys in the White House, and then it's just going to become this whole thing where, hey,  all right, guys in the White House, you go fuck yourself.  Yeah, but who'd you rather have, a woman or a black guy?  I honestly don't know.  I've given that a lot of thought.  A woman, probably, but Hillary is a whole other story.  Well, there's no other women out there.  We're going to come close.  You're going to have a Clinton.  It'll be Clinton and Bush for the last 20 years. 
[03:06:30]  It'll be another fucking Republican.  Excellent point that I've already made that Bob just reiterated you're right.  What?  You didn't even talk in 10 minutes.  Oh, geez, don't do that.  When did you make it all?  Am I supposed to take notes on the show every day to make sure?  Dad, get it back in 19 days.  There's going to, what's going to happen is, and I really think this will happen, if it  comes down to a Hillary and Obama Democratic runoff there, it's going to go to one or the  other, and then the Republicans will win.  But maybe if it's...  Because I really think, no matter what, this country is not ready for a black or woman president. 
[03:07:00]  It just isn't.  You think like McCain or Giuliani can be president of the United States?  Whoever gets the Republican nod, that's going to be the next president.  Hillary's such a, fucking believe me, nothing will unite Republicans like a fucking thick  angst or something.  Yeah, but Obama is excited.  He's exciting because he's a media.  I just wanted to say that to get you mad.  No, I don't...  He fucking...  I don't hate...  It's like...  No, he's smart enough.  He's smart enough and shit. 
[03:07:30]  I'm just saying, he's not the most qualified.  Remember that?  We used to do shit through fucking merit.  He's been a senator for a couple fucking years.  He hasn't done anything.  What the fuck?  Think of me...  What if you're Joe McCain?  You've been a senator for how long?  For decades.  In his prison camp.  Fucking rats.  Yeah, you've done everything.  No, you wouldn't want him because he's old and white.  It's time for fucking change.  But if he's president, though, he's going to fuck...  I mean, dude, he's against the UFC.  He's against anything that's fucking cool.  UFC.  Oh, is that how you're going to vote? 
[03:08:00]  What's Hillary fucking blowing Chuck Liddell?  He's the cause of why the UFC almost went under.  Because he actually spoke out against it so much.  Well, God damn it, you changed my mind, Bob.  Do you think if he's president, he'll really push for the UFC to get...  I think he'll actually fucking really eliminate a lot of fun shit in life.  Yeah.  I'll be like...  Like what?  Legal?  No, he's actually...  The president doesn't have that kind of pull.  Yeah, but...  The Corleons don't have that kind of pull.  The King?  The King?  The King?  The King?  The King?  The King?  The King?  The King?  The King?  The King?  It does roll downhill. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah?  Because the FCC got much more conservative under Bush.  Not that shit wouldn't have happened under Clinton, but...  Clinton's the one that appointed all those motherfuckers.  But he got more conservative, way more conservative under Bush.  But that's not where the censorship's coming from.  No, and it's not.  Everyone's self-censoring now, going way beyond what the FCC would allow.  Because they're all scared of fucking Reverend Al, or an Asian group, or some other group  that's going to fucking protest, and say they're going to boycott, and then instead of the 
[03:09:00]  companies going, go ahead, fucking boycott, and watching that nothing comes of it, they  fucking buckle under.  FCC, though, has all been parents' television council, and they're a very religious, conservative  group.  I just want some kind of balance for entertainment, because I'm tired of that fucking, and no  one gives back.  I think Obama's dance card would be a little full to concentrate on, if we can say potty  words on the radio.  But he wouldn't pursue it.  He wouldn't pursue it on his morality ship.  No, so that wouldn't change. 
[03:09:30]  Obama did agree with Imus's firing, let's not forget.  Yeah, that's another thing, because it was race-based.  Most politicians.  Because it was race-based.  But that's where the censorship's coming.  And it's not always on, I know the far right, the evangelicals, yeah, they're a little hung  up on sex and shit.  But that's not where it's coming from.  You go to a college campus, nowhere will you find more, less free speech.  Oh, I know.  And that's liberal ideology.  Yep.  That's blocking your shit.  Absolutely.  I didn't know about that.  They don't want to offend anybody, any groups. 
[03:10:00]  I didn't know that until Jimmy brought it to my attention, that you guys have to deal  with this crap on college campuses.  Oh, are you kidding me?  That's the bastion.  I have no clue.  That's the bastion of political correctness.  That's when you guys...  That's where this shit is coming from.  I've had a signed document.  Oh, what is he saying?  Fuck you.  I had a signed...  I did a show with Tracy Morgan.  We had both signed documents to say that we wouldn't say or talk about a certain subject  or certain...  I got paid.  He didn't.  Just to let you know.  He was on stage for five minutes.  I fucked a chick in a kidney.  I'm Tracy Morgan. 
[03:10:30]  I'm hilarious.  I'm hilarious.  I finger fucked my wife because it reminds me of my son.  I'm Tracy Morgan.  I'm hilarious.  And I bet you he did get paid eventually.  Yeah.  Because somebody said, hey, you don't pay him.  No, he didn't get paid.  And it happened twice.  Well, that's the first time a black guy has ever been centered in a comedy club.  No, it was at a college.  At a college.  Where does that shit come from?  It was a college.  Whatever.  Where does that shit come from with the college campuses being so politically correct like  that?  Because all the professors are fucking hippies from the 60s. 
[03:11:00]  They have all the institutions.  You know, the best book I ever read.  It may turn me into the angry fucking white guy there.  But Robert Bork, Slouching Towards Gomorrah.  You ever read that book?  No.  Fellas.  I'm reading a book on Reddit right now.  That'll change it.  Good one.  That'll change it.  Who runs the media and why.  And, you know, they're socialists and how they hate the nuclear family.  That's why the dad's an asshole in every commercial.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he heads the nuclear family.  And if you're going to have a socialist revolution, you can't do it unless everybody's an individual. 
[03:11:30]  You can't have little pockets of family.  It makes so much friends.  Oh, that's pretty good.  I'm telling you.  Well, Nick fucked me on commercials.  I'll have to pick that one up.  He actually said something.  Slouching towards Gomorrah.  You actually say all the time about it.  Because I never.  I always watch commercials.  Yeah, now you do it, aren't you?  Now I watch commercials.  I'm like, wow, that guy really is fucking a pussy.  Oh, it's just every commercial.  The guy's a fucking idiot.  It's about emasculating white men.  That's all television has become.  I don't give a shit.  On the way in here, I listened to one of your ads.  It was a 30-second blurb.  It's a little girl saying, the father, well, if you're scared, I'll go down the ski slope for her. 
[03:12:00]  It's just fucking relentless.  And my wife is ready to leave me because I can't not point it out.  And my father's doing it now.  And my mother's ready to leave him.  Oh, fuck.  I gotta take notice now.  Just watch.  Oh, yeah.  When you watch a Super Bowl, you'll get it in and in.  If you watch football every Sunday, I can't fucking take it.  I can't.  I'm pretty observant usually.  I've never picked up.  Oh, my God.  I gotta check this shit out.  There's a yoga commercial.  She's on the phone talking. 
[03:12:30]  Well, I'm losing weight.  And he's just like an ape searching through them.  There's one for blinds.  And there's two women by the blinds.  And they're watching the husband out by the barbecue.  With the barbecue blowing himself up.  And he's blowing himself up because he's just a fucking retard.  Fucking idiot.  Idiot.  And they're with the blinds like, oh, there's my asshole.  There's my sperm donor so I can have kids.  Yeah.  And you can see right through them.  That's the fucking line for the blind thing.  And you can see right through.  Imagine saying that about a broad showing her fucking up in the kitchen.  They have a bunch of dykes in front of fucking CBS. 
[03:13:00]  Exactly.  And a bunch of guys are just laughing at her.  Look at my dumb bitch.  She can't do shit.  Oh, forget about it.  Now it would be everywhere.  Can you fucking imagine that?  Yep.  That does mean, though, that white guys are still doing well.  Because what happens is we're the only safe targets.  Meaning it's obviously so ludicrous.  It's getting smaller, though.  It is.  But I'm saying it's so ludicrous.  Like, everybody.  Like, if you do a woman in the kitchen, you're right.  You know what?  That is what that bitch does.  She cooks.  But if it's a guy, it's like, oh, pick on the strong one. 
[03:13:30]  That's the weak picking on the strong.  That's the way they see it.  That's why, in a way, it annoys me.  But that's where it comes from.  Oh, like, you make a great joke about the fucking, oh, the joke about the dad and the computer.  So he's even dad can figure it out.  And you're like, oh, who, the guy that bought the fucking computer?  It's a great joke.  I love that one, yeah.  But there's too much truth in it the other way.  Like, this is almost an exaggeration that's ridiculous.  And that's why this is so doing it.  But what it's doing is it's fucking, it has tainted the fucking subconscious of a whole generation of broads who, you get, like, my nieces wear a shirt, you know, boys are stupid. 
[03:14:00]  It says on the T-shirt.  Seriously, at what point do you like fucking, and then I read a whole article in the Post, you know, 91% of school teachers, middle school teachers are women.  All the curriculum, there's no, there's no kids don't, little boys don't get to read about adventurous shit and stuff they like to do.  It's all kind of been feminized.  Sure.  And the kids who, the boys who are hyperactive, they put them on Ritalin.  All just fucking male traits. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's all fucking true, man.  Aggressiveness and competitive nature.  Yeah.  I've heard 22-year-old girls, like, in nightclubs and shit.  I've heard this a hundred times in the last five years, yelling at some guys in a park, like, I'll kick your ass.  And they fucking believe it.  And that's a product of them being conditioned by fucking anti-mail messages over and over again.  It's fucking relentless.  They just need a nice fucking punch right in the face.  You gotta feel like that, like the opening scene of that movie with Sarah Silverman, where she just gets clocked right in the fucking face. 
[03:15:00]  She wakes up and her door, the cock door's open and she's just wedged in between it.  But it really, it's fucking, I mean, watch, when you watch the Super Bowl, any Sunday, but especially the Super Bowl, just watch the commercials, how people are portrayed.  It's always like a bank, it'll be a black boss with a nice suit on, and a white guy with a shitty tie, $4 shirt, fucking messy hair.  Every white guy has a receding hairline and is an ugly fuck and just unlikable.  I want to know who's casting this shit.  What's wrong with that?  Huh?  What's wrong with that?  You know, it gets me, there's a commercial now that gets me, and if it was the other way around, it would just be fucking unheard of. 
[03:15:30]  It's, I think for a bank.  WAMU, I think.  Yeah, yeah, and it's, this black guy seems to have corralled up a load of old white guys.  Yeah.  And he's leading them around with his cleverness and trickery.  He's tricking all these old business white guys into doing his bidding.  And I said, what if it's some old white guy and a corral of black guys? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, it would be believable.  Well, you know, it's, who's looking at this commercial, though?  I was watching it and going, you know, that, what the fuck?  How do you get away with that?  My buddy Joe Liss, this kid I have opened for me, he was telling me about it.  He went to a bank.  He went to his bank, and I don't know what bank it was, but there's a little thing that says,  78% of our employees are women.  What the fuck is that?  What does that mean?  Is that fucking good? 
[03:16:30]  Why is that fucking good?  Or is that...  Are they more qualified than a fucking guy?  Why is that fucking good?  If they're telling you, chances are all you tell is going to be a cunt.  You can pay yourself.  And don't expect a change to be counted properly.  Expect an error.  And she's probably on her fucking rag, so she's going to be irrational.  Exactly.  Don't put the money in your mouth.  They're going for the nurturing angle.  Did you start balancing a fucking toilet paper budget at home?  Give her a break.  It's somebody's agenda, man.  Did you ever hit a chick? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Did somebody's fucking...  What?  Did you ever hit a chick?  Never.  Ever in your life?  No.  Never shook her?  I tackled a girl over a couch.  Like a fucking harmless thing.  What'd you do?  I said I tackled a girl.  It was a girl, Michelle, that I dated.  She was like 12 years older than me.  She put me through the wringer.  Fucking...  No, it was no fucking...  I've never ever even slapped a girl.  You've never slapped a chick?  No.  You goon arm a girl if you have to.  Goon hand.  Goon hand.  There's better ways of hurting them emotionally. 
[03:17:30]  Absolutely.  Than fucking...  You don't need to hit them.  No, you can just fuck them up with words.  That's all.  Just come in and put your middle finger on the nose and go,  Hey, that's your best friend's answer.  That'll fucking cripple her for life.  Everyone's a Hannibal Lecter when it comes to the...  You can just, with words, make them fucking kill themselves like multiple meeks.  You fuck another girl, and then you fuck your girl before you clean your dick off.  Just really straight and fix...  It's called fixing her wagon.  If there's like this agenda, whose is it? 
[03:18:00]  I'm not going to say.  You heard Bobby Fischer.  It's a conspiracy.  I know, but where...  Yeah, right?  Where did it...  Like, how does everyone know it's just a wink and a nod that this is what we're going to do?  This is the course we're going to pursue.  Without some secret society meeting at this huge 100 million person arena.  Well, Colin Quinn is a great theory on that, because I do say it's a conspiracy, but it's so...  He says it's not.  They're so ingrained, and they have people believing it doesn't have to be a conspiracy. 
[03:18:30]  It's just accepted.  It just grew into it.  Yes.  It evolved somehow from...  Well, I think it's still six guys making phone calls.  Let's make the Gentile guy look like the asshole.  I'm not saying anything.  It went from, you know, the 50s, leave it to beaver kind of Ward Cleaver was the fucking man in charge.  Father knows best.  Would they ever say that today in a fucking million years?  Father knows best.  No way.  That would be sexist fucking...  Yeah.  Misogynist.  You're saying the father knows better than the wife? 
[03:19:00]  How do you know?  How dare you?  She's college educated, and there's...  All right.  Sorry.  When's the last time...  I ask this on stage a lot.  I always...  I go, when's the last time a fictional character, woman, was portrayed as angry, stupid, mean,  or just unlikable?  Fucking all the family?  No, no, she was likable.  Yeah, exactly.  Somebody always goes, Suzanne Somers was...  I go, thank you for proving my fucking point.  1975.  75.  A ditzy blonde.  Thank you.  When's the last time you had a bride who was unlikable, a fictional character, just had 
[03:19:30]  negative qualities?  And just not empowered kind of a thing?  Yes.  Because you could say, like, Roseanne was very negative, but she had the...  But she had the balls.  But she had the juice in the family, you know?  And she was funny.  Yeah.  But, seriously, it's fucking...  Yeah, it's like Suzanne Somers, all the little fucking titty things from the 70s, and then  you're just...  Nah.  It's all empowered, strong...  I mean, if I see one more fucking movie where, like, Meg Ryan's beating up six Navy SEALs,  I'm gonna...  Yeah, who needs that?  What the fuck?  Seriously, I can't get past... 
[03:20:00]  There's no reality in it.  I can't...  Remember when there used to be sex objects in films?  Yeah.  They don't have any of that?  No gratuitous shots of boobs and ass anymore?  There's another thing that gets to me, and I've talked about this on the air.  I watch Discovery Channel, I like the Military Channel, and when they do interviews with  pilots, love it.  Yeah.  Black, white, the same thing.  Right.  These guys are by the fucking book, and I love...  You watch a movie with a black guy as a fighter pilot, and it's like, yeah, missile  away, motherfucker! 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah!  I'm bringing that guy down and shit!  It's like, that doesn't sound like any pilot I've heard interviewed on any fucking channel.  310 to Yuma?  Did you see 310 to Yuma?  Yeah.  The Western?  Yep.  Right at the beginning, Russell Crowe...  Not Russell Crowe.  Who's the fucking other guy?  The other guy, yeah.  His name's Christian Bale.  Who's the other?  Christian Bale.  Yeah, Christian Bale.  His wife...  We make decisions together.  That's not how fucking women talked in 1850 with a husband.  Really?  And I'm not saying... 
[03:21:00]  I know you're going...  He's a reactionary.  That's how he wants it.  Fucking maybe.  But the fucking little kid is being real snotty to his father, Christian Bale.  You know...  Shit wouldn't happen.  Not back then.  Fucking kids didn't talk to them.  No.  They take painstaking detail to get the fucking outfits right from 1850.  But they have the kid talking like he was born in 1986.  And I can't get past it.  Yeah.  I want to enjoy this fucking movie.  But there's a liberal streak.  It's...  I just saw that one, Into the Wild, that Sean Penn directed. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, Christ.  And just fucking...  Anything he does.  I mean, I would have loved it, but I can't get past the fucking message behind it.  That capitalism's fucking bad.  It's fucking...  It had the mother and father who didn't treat the kid good.  They were all about money and material things.  Yeah.  I mean, there's some too...  But I can't get fucking past it.  It's just...  It's like watching propaganda.  And I still enjoyed...  As bad as the message was, I still enjoyed some of the fucking movie.  It was that good a story.  But I can't... 
[03:22:00]  I can't...  That's a great observation.  There are things...  There are just things going on.  There are things going on.  I like the six guys on the phone theory.  Hey.  But I can't...  You know, it's fine.  And people don't have time.  And I...  Because people are working.  They have families.  Yeah.  It's 50 hours.  You know, comics.  We have time to fucking...  You know...  You have to mull this over.  Yes.  And...  Like, my sisters think I'm crazy and shit.  But now they're coming around.  You finally got them.  You know, I call up and I go, 
[03:22:30]  Look at the fucking white guy in this commercial.  Seriously.  If you point it out enough,  like you said,  you'll either...  They'll leave you.  Yeah.  Or they'll start coming around.  Yeah.  You got a...  You know, a criticism I got from my girlfriend.  She's like,  It's really hard to be around someone  who's raging all the time at people.  And I'm like,  I guess I am.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's like...  It's always that...  Just that...  It won't go.  It's like that...  I hope he gets fucking...  And she's like,  I get it.  We're eating.  We're trying to enjoy ourselves.  She should hang out with my wife. 
[03:23:00]  He broke his car horn one day.  He was just in New York.  Like, that never happens.  There's never traffic in New York.  And he's just smashing his horn  with his little fist.  Fucking move!  And it just broke.  Gets so pissed.  He had nothing.  He had to yell his head out the window.  What?  Why?  Adam, why?  Over to that microphone.  Why are you wearing a...  Hold on.  ...bunny ears?  Interesting story coming up,  ladies and gentlemen.  Adam's one of our new interns  that is trying to get attention, 
[03:23:30]  I guess.  No, Sam said,  Go wear this  because I was cleaning out the office.  And Sam said,  Wear this  when you give the feedback  to Fan.  To Fan?  Fan?  No, yeah, it's Fan.  It's a fan of Sam.  Yeah, Fan.  Crazy.  No, uh...  I kind of feel like  I'm a Christian.  Oh, holy shit.  I feel like I'm  pledging a fraternity right now.  Yeah.  That's fine.  What the hell's going on?  Five beta douche-a.  E-Rack has him  cleaning out the office. 
[03:24:00]  So instead of  actually cleaning out the office,  he's peeking through everything  and looking at all the fun stuff.  So he sees his bunny rabbit thing.  Fun stuff like the ears.  And he's like,  Oh, I should put this on my head.  No.  Shut up.  And he was like,  and so he put it on his head.  And then he was like,  I like this kid.  And he said,  Hey, should I go in  and give feedback like this?  I said, yeah, sure.  Oh, so it was your idea.  No, you said go in  and give feedback.  Oh, shut up, Adam.  Why'd you think,  let me ask you, Adam,  why'd you think  that you should go in there?  I mean, like,  we're all gonna look at him  and go,  Who is this nut?  Let's get to know this kid. 
[03:24:30]  No, I just thought,  I think it's funny.  He's a star on  the Fan and Sam show.  Not anymore, he's not.  How are bunny ears funny  unless you're blowing someone  at the end of The Shining?  True, very true.  How is he on your show  and doesn't know your name?  Why not?  Fan.  He gets it right every time.  No.  They make him sing karaoke.  What did you sing  this Saturday night?  This past Saturday?  I sang REO Speedwagon,  Keep on Loving You.  Would you mind if we'd do your bit?  Not at all.  It'll help the Fan and Sam show. 
[03:25:00]  How do you do that?  Well, you just play the song  and then he sings.  Not even a karaoke version?  No.  I came in to watch  the Fan and Sam show  and they actually,  sorry I said it that way,  but they did a really good show.  It was very entertaining.  They actually did a good show.  I stopped myself.  But Adam came in  to do like karaoke  and it was just awful.  We have his version.  Oh, you want to just hear that?  Oh, yeah.  Where's the wrestling  you had in, by the way?  Oh, no, we have the song ready  so we can recreate it.  Those rabbit ears  look like a couple  of cunt lips  like Tommy Lee  get hold of them.  Entire nuts. 
[03:25:30]  Are you going to do this  for us?  Whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Wow, he sounds a little pissed.  Really?  It doesn't matter.  We're ripping off  Fan and Sam,  hoo, hoo, hoo,  but this is what  Adam did for the  Fan and Sam show  this past Saturday.  So he listens to the song  on the headphones  and he sings along.  Right?  Right on.  All right.  Go ahead.  Hit the song.  You guys film it.  It's a good one.  You're going to get  the douche chills.  Bring back some memories.  All the ladies out there.  The douche chills.  Ladies. 
[03:26:00]  Uh-oh, it's going to be  nutty, folks.  You should have seen  by the look in my eyes, baby  There was something missing  Wow, that was  perfect pitch.  You should have known  by the tone of my voice, baby  That's up.  You didn't listen  Here comes  Big part  And I exist  But you never bled  Instead you lay 
[03:26:30]  Still in the grass  All caught up in his sound  Here it comes  Big chorus  No?  Not yet.  That's right.  Okay.  What do I know?  And though I know  All about those men  Sure you do.  I don't remember  Cause it was us, baby  Way before then  And we're still together 
[03:27:00]  And I meant  Every word I said  When I said that  I love you  I meant  That I love you forever  And I'm gonna keep  On loving you  Cause it's the only thing  I wanna do  We got Jerry in West Palm Beach 
[03:27:30]  On the phone.  Jerry, what's up?  Hopefully it's Blair's cousin.  Hey, Jerry.  Hey, I just want to say  That I completely agree  With Nick DiPaolo  And I do the same exact thing.  I watch these movies  And I can't  I can't pass the fact  That these liberals  Trying to get their measures by  But I also want to say  If you notice  On these comedian shows  These comic series  You always notice  That the guy  Is just a stupid dad  And that the mom  Is just the smart cunt  In every single comedian show 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, like  Comedian show  Everybody loves Raymond  King of Queens  Yeah  He invented the comedy show  I love that  Whereas one of the greatest ever  The guys were strong and awful  Like in all the family  Archie  I mean, he loved Edith  It was obvious  But she was a fucking dope  I mean, Louie was a brutal guy  Even when she wasn't married  In Taxi  So it's like  Where the fucking shows  Have been the greatest  Even though  The Honeymooners  Used that formula  Of her being the strong bright one  But they didn't do it 
[03:28:30]  To be fashionable  They did it because  That was the funny way  To go in that show  Yeah, but he was gonna punch her  In every episode  Yeah, yeah  Threatening physical violence  On her  The fucking mother-in-law  How he just used a rag  On the mother-in-law  But people would go back  Then go  Obviously he's not gonna  Hit his wife  Wait, today  It's been drilled into the head  That every guy's a potential  Rapist  Yeah, yeah  Watching this  Type of violence  Only makes people  Beat their  What does it  You don't just laugh  In the Honeymooners movie  That they remade  The Black Honeymooners  He didn't threaten to hit her  Because it wasn't  Because that's not good  Of course not 
[03:29:00]  Why would they  I'd like to think  That after  You know  The Honeymooners episode  Is over  That there's a lot of  Beating going on  Behind closed doors  Yeah  She's pounding her  In the face  That's how I like  To look at it  They just didn't want  To show that part  Of the sitcom  Her change  To the sink  In the bathroom  When he would just  Wave his fist  And go  You dirty old  It was great  He's gonna punch her  This is great  Yeah  But I got a fucking guy  All right yeah  I do my radio show  And we're talking  About sitcom  And the guy goes  The guy actually said  One of my listeners

Field  What W.C. Field said 
[03:31:00]  That's the difference  Between a comedian  And just a regular person  To make a regular person  Laugh  You know  You dress a person up  Like an old lady  Push them down the stairs  To make a comedian laugh  You actually push  Your old lady  That's good  Hey I gotta take a leak  Quick break  We'll finish up  With Nick DiPaolo  Do line of the day  We got a couple more  The young gentleman  Who wants to be a journalist  Talking about Texas  That's where this whole thing started  That was funny by the way  The karaoke  Good job man
