<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a rapid-fire, controversial self-description, immediately establishing its tone.  Big A joined Opie and Anthony in studio.  A major segment featured "Jimmy Shirt Day," showcasing oversized, ill-fitting shirts provided by guest Jimmy Norton's mother, generating crude jokes about their appearance.  Anthony recounted a humiliating corporate event for CBS Radio, detailing his intentionally sloppy attire and using highly offensive language towards CBS President Dan Mason. He briefly introduced a musical artist onstage.  The show included vulgar "F.U. Line" calls, a discussion about a Long Island radio station's cheap gas promotion, and Scorch's planned stunt of living in a Great Dane cage for charity.  Political commentary covered the Indiana and North Carolina primaries, mocking Hillary Clinton's "Reasons I Love America" list with their own crude, listener-contributed version.  They also discussed a horrific child abuse case and Roger Clemens' Yankee return, punctuated by further crude jokes and listener feedback.

The show continued with a caller detailing graphic extramarital affairs, mentioning country singers, waitresses, and John Daly's ex-girlfriend. This transitioned into a discussion of a Yankee fan murdering a Red Sox fan, including detailed descriptions and legal ramifications. A caller grieving his brother's death in the incident shared his desire for the perpetrator to live with the guilt.  The hosts discussed the caller's reaction to a coma documentary, with Jim Norton revealing his emotional struggles processing these intense topics.  A segment focused on a substitute teacher fired for performing a simple magic trick, followed by news stories about a body found in a New Jersey canal (gnawed on by turtles) and a man punching a baby camel at Six Flags.  Penn Jillette then appeared as a guest.

Penn Jillette discussed his experience watching Jim Norton's HBO special, his time on *Dancing with the Stars*, and the erosion of liberties post-9/11, touching on freedom, security, and personal anecdotes involving travel and security screenings. He discussed his online content ("Penn Says"), his Showtime series, and his approach to interviewing guests with differing viewpoints.  He expressed skepticism towards psychics, particularly regarding 9/11's post-hoc interpretations, and debated global warming with Anthony, criticizing exaggeration in promoting both global warming and AIDS awareness.  He shared his political humor, including a joke about Hillary Clinton. The conversation included opinions on Obama and McCain’s campaigns and further promotion of Penn's work.  The latter part of Jillette’s appearance shifted to Opie and Anthony's frustrations with their show's division between CBS and XM radio, detailing conflict with Rover and internal tensions between production teams, highlighting communication issues and the perceived devaluation of the XM segment.

The show further explored the Sirius/XM merger, the hosts' perceived lack of accountability to XM, and communication issues with staff, including Logan and Steve.  They mocked the new executive producer, "Stunt Brain," and engaged in a phone call with Randy Spears, teasing him about a gas giveaway.  Actor Michael Madsen called in, discussing his dogs, "Vice," independent film distribution, Sam Peckinpah, Quentin Tarantino, and his acting career.  A listener's UFO story, a caller claiming a connection to the President's housekeeper, and listener feedback were briefly included.  They addressed a listener’s complaint about Opie's movie recommendation ("Baby Mama") and ended with a training video skit and more speculation about Stunt Brain.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about a sick co-worker, Bob, followed by the announcement of their show's expansion on SiriusXM.  The main focus became a news story about a Sacramento home filled with hundreds of frozen dead cats, with highly offensive commentary on the son's motives and mental state.  The graphic details were described alongside vulgar jokes.  A news story about a man using his toes to dial 911 after a machinery accident followed, again discussed with crude humor and interruptions. Jokes about cell phones and further offensive banter ensued.  The final part addressed the show's ratings, internal SiriusXM conflicts, and frustrations with the rating system, concluding with more offensive jokes and sexually explicit comments focusing on bodily functions and a graphic prank involving foreskin.

[00:25:00]  To the first  Hundred and six  Hundred and six  Four one oh six  That's good  So  So that's what they were doing  Do we get  The reaction  To the first  One hundred and six  Drivers who showed up  Many of those people  Waited hours  To buy that cheap gas  As a mom  It's just been insane  Trying to live on Long Island  And the price of gas  It just keeps going up  And up and up  I don't know how long  People are going to be able  To handle the gas  Being this price  And it just goes up  Every other day  Really 
[00:25:30]  Every other day  Every other day  Every other day  They wait in line for hours  What are they bringing  Like tubs and stuff  To fill up  Get a hold of yourself  Saving like  Thirty bucks  Oh there's not much  To do  To be sure  This was a  This was a day out  For a lot of those  Soccer moms  Cost a lot on Long Island  Going up every day  Every day  And half  Half these dummies  They wait in line  And their car's just idling  Just burning fuel  Yeah 
[00:26:00]  They just don't even know  How to do it right  Yeah so that's  That's pretty much  A staple  Of radio hackdom  I want to do  The ultimate  Gas promotion  I want to do  A penny a gallon  How do we get that done  Now that  Is never done  How do we get  A penny a gallon done  With four dollar  A gallon gas  How do we get that done  Go to  Go to one  On the FM dial  Leave this station  Yeah  Nothing  We could do it 
[00:26:30]  For an hour  Just like these hacks did  How about  One penny gas  For the first  One person  I like that  And then  You have to drink it  He shoved the pump  Down their throat  And then  We're finding out  That our  Our dear friend  Scorch  Is also doing  Some  Some hack radio  This is  Who's got the story  On Scorch  This is Scorch  The ultimate Scorch  This is what Scorch  Is all about  Used to work with him 
[00:27:00]  Back in the day  At AF  In Worcester Massachusetts  Kingdom of Nakedness  Totally nude radio  Totally nude  I think most of the listeners  Understand what Scorch  Is all about  Well he's  He's got a great  A great thing  He's doing in the very near future  Are we looking for Sam  Who's going to do this one  Sam  Sam is the spokesman  For Scorch  Does Travis have it  Oh look at that shirt  I don't know anymore  Jesus  Jimmy's shirt day  Alright what do we got  What is Scorch doing  He posted a MySpace bulletin  Oh wait  It's so important  He had to do a bulletin  Oh yeah  All of his friends 
[00:27:30]  He asked me to be his friend  That's how important Scorch is  Hey be my friend  But uh  Starting on Monday  A week from yesterday  He'll be living  In a cage  A Great Dane cage  Outside the Verizon  Wireless Arena  In uh  I assume  Manchester New Hampshire  Yes  To raise $10,000  For uh  For homeless animals  I believe  For the Animal Rescue League  Animal Rescue League  And other animal groups  In the area  And he'll be living there  24-7 
[00:28:00]  Yeah he writes  24-7  He writes in his uh  What would  Um uh  His Bolton  Yeah  In huge capital letters  This is 100% legit  I'm sure it is  I'm legit  Oh of course  Why even ask  And then he writes  Animals have no say  In what happens to them  I'm just doing something  Very near and dear  To me  Near and dear  So that said  Listen to Rock 101  Rock101fm.com  And find out exactly  How you can make a donation  Thanks so much Scorch  So he's gonna be in  How big is the cage  Is there any picture of it 
[00:28:30]  Or  Well it hasn't started yet  So  Oh  Well I would assume  He has the cage  I would hope so  I would think that  He would put a picture  Of the cage up  Like this is the cage  I'm gonna be in  Is he gonna live  Among the animals  That's a good question  Yeah  No  Huh  I don't think so  Me  I'm sure he'll just  Set up his cage  Outside the shelter  Or whatever  And take some pictures  In it  Hey I'm Scorch  Oh you don't think  He's gonna stay in there  He'll just take some pictures  And then  I gotta go 
[00:29:00]  Scorch  That's a cage  Alright  A Great Dane cage  That's not much room  No  That's  Scorch has a very short  Attention span  And used to go to  Very minimal  Listener gatherings  And stuff like that  So I don't see him  I think he's gonna  Try to meet his goal  Within 15 minutes  Or so  He's gonna go to the  Bathroom in that thing  Can we get Scorch  On the phone  Of course  Now we have to  Talk to Scorch  I gotta know  About this promotion 
[00:29:30]  Sure  Tony in Huntington  What's up  Boys  As a Long Island man  20 years old  I'm very ashamed  Of that hack promotion  Going on  On the South Shore  Well every radio station  Yeah every radio station  In America  Has done that  Dumb gas promotion  Mark Jersey  What's up  Yeah  Opie and Anthony  Should do the  $9.23 gallon gas  That is our frequency  Here in New York City  We can do  $9.23 
[00:30:00]  A gallon gas  How many people  Pull up for it  Yeah  Oh really  They are  That's not a bad idea  We'll do it for an hour  And you got our  And someone else  Blue Heeler  Is suggesting  Baby diaper gas blowout  What is that  Do you want to do  The baby diaper gas blowout  How is that done  Well Blue Heeler  Writes  Idiots can get gas  For $1 a gallon  But they have to show up  In nothing but a diaper  In diapers  Yeah  The baby diaper gas blowout  I think a little  Embarrassment 
[00:30:30]  Should be tied  To the contest  Sure  Of the promotion  Alright Mark  Thank you  You're welcome  And also today's  Primary day in Indiana  And North Carolina  Yes  Obama's got North Carolina  Right  I hope so  Does he  And he lost his lead  In Indiana  But I mean he's still leading  But he lost a lot of his leads  Jeremiah Wright really hurt him  Really hurt him  Sure  He's leveled off  He's not losing  Like he was  And it depends on  What station you watch  And what poll  They were paying attention to  But yeah  That did hurt Obama 
[00:31:00]  But I'll tell you one thing  He was  He gave a little  Little speech there  On CNN  An interview  On CNN  And I was watching  A little bit of that  He does sound good  And  But the thing is  He kind of  Caters  What he says  To who he's talking to  Which I don't like  But it's  Like a politician  But  Boy he really gets  You thinking about  Politics and business as usual  And how he wants to change things 
[00:31:30]  And  You kind of watch and go  Wow that would kind of be cool  Then you realize  Eh it's probably a bunch of crap  I don't think anything's going to change  It's the same effect  Ross Perot had  It's like  You just want something different  Yeah  Except he's a democrat  And not so nutty independent  But I also don't like  When he talks about  Giving so much tax credit  And tax back  To lower class  And middle class  And stuff like that  It's like  Well that's got to be made up somewhere  And unfortunately  It's made up by the people  That have used this country 
[00:32:00]  To attain a certain  American dream  Me  You're the American dream  I don't want to be  Taxed any more  Than I am  I'm taxed enough  Who does  But then you can't sell that  Because the majority of people  They're not as fortunate  I understand  But it kind of  You know  Kind of hurts  I want to sit there  And pay more than half  You know what Obama  Has brought to this election  This time around  Oh I better not say that  What  3.5 million new voters 
[00:32:30]  Registered  Really  3.5 million  That is a movement  My friend  Oh boy  People are motivated  This time around  To vote  Oh jeez  It's interesting right  Oh yeah  And then you got  Hillary  She had to do her top 10  Last night  Oh she did  Well you know  I bet the delivery  Is fantastic  The top 10 reasons  She looks like 8 bells  8 bells  Poor 8 bells  Similar ankles 
[00:33:00]  That horrific story  From the Kentucky Derby  Showed the poor horse  With his front legs  Just curled under  Oh man  Can't stand on him  This hurts  Yeah  Are you going to put me  In a cast or something  No  What are you going to do  To help me out  No we decided  A long time ago  That we need to kill  Every horse  That breaks an ankle  Yeah  Just break a little leg  You think in this day and age  They can figure out  Something else  For the poor horses  The poor horse is just there  Going like  Hey you know  Kind of hurts  I broke both legs here  They're folded under  But oh here comes a truck  Yeah 
[00:33:30]  That's good  I'm sure he'll  He's going to wrap my legs up  Make me feel a little better  Maybe put me on a nice  Comfy horse bed  Hi guy  Are you going to  That's what they do  Maybe we should ask the horse  What he wants done  Yeah  Maybe the horse would go  You know what  This is going to be very painful  And it's  And the odds are against me  But I  I'm going to  I'm going to try to survive this  They don't even get the choice 
[00:34:00]  Yeah  Just  I guess  A lot of people don't know  When they break their legs  It's not so much the broken leg  They can put them in a cast  But when they  Can't walk around  Is when horses get screwed up  Like it screws up their  Their hooves  And gives them infections  And stuff  So  That usually winds up  Killing them anyway  Yeah  It's not just the broken legs  If you can put them in a cast  And have them walk around  The other horses can sign the cast  You know  It's not like that 
[00:34:30]  It's not like people  Do you think the horse panics  When the tent comes out  Oh  They kind of put the tent around  No  Here comes the tent  You're looking for sleeping bags  And marshmallows  And when you don't see them  You know you're a dead thing  The blood splattered tent  Yeah  They don't even watch  The blood off of it  From the last  Poor bastard horse  Here comes a guy  With a chainsaw  Yeah  Oh boy  Looks like Jack Waltz's bed  Well getting back to Hillary  She did her top ten 
[00:35:00]  Top ten reasons  She loves America  On Letterman  This should be  Why she loves America  And why did Letterman  Have to do it with Hillary  He did it with Obama  What is it  That's why  Is it an equal time thing  Or  They don't have to do that  Equal time anymore  But I guess because  You know  Leading Democratic candidates  You want to get them in there  I was  I thought like Obama  Would be more hip  Because you know  The new thing is  For these candidates  To do the pop culture thing  Clinton started that 
[00:35:30]  By playing the saxophone  Exactly  Arsenio  We all knew Hillary  Wouldn't be hip  Doing the whole pop culture thing  But I thought Obama  Would have a little more to him  And he just doesn't  You saw the bowling thing  He was awkward  When he was on WWE  You know  Raw  Whatever show he was on  He just  He's  He's a nerd  He's kind of a nerd  Jimmy  You're right  He's a nerd  Kind of a nerd  We're not just a black nerd  We don't know how to handle them  We expect all black people  To be very cool  We only know one  Urkel  We haven't seen many black nerds  In our  In our lives  That's true

[00:45:30]  And it's very rare  Anthony goes to the bathroom  He runs off to another bathroom  I don't know  I guess there's another bathroom  On this floor  Anthony  Anthony found it  A long time ago  Because he's just  He's just ashamed  Of his  Not ashamed of anything  I just don't want  To go in there  If it smells like  A monkey cage  I think you  You kind of got  Weird bathroom habits  Though  We've kind of  Talked about that  Over the years  Why  Because I won't  Stand at the urinal  Next to you and Jimmy  Well that's kind of a bummer  Three in a row  Why would I want to do that 
[00:46:00]  We don't go  Jimmy is a touchy feely  Peaky guy  We don't go  Side by side  You don't have to take a peek  We don't go side by side  We have the buffer  In between us  No you lean out  A little far from  The urinal  We do play a little chicken  We see how far we could  We could back off  From the urinal  Before the other person  Gets uncomfortable  Sure  But that's just  That's just  That's wholesome fun  Yeah  Sure  Good clean fun  You go in the stall  To just do number one  Which I don't understand  And when you do number two 
[00:46:30]  You're flushing the whole time  Because you're just ashamed  Of what is going on  That is  It's called a courtesy flush  On the rare occasion  Don't you know  That I do use the bathroom  Don't you want to know  What you have accomplished  In there though  No  Because I see  What you guys accomplished  I walked into the bathroom  Hoping that nobody  Had used it  For that reason  And what was in the bottom  Of that toilet  I can't even describe  Who left that by the way  Was that you  It was me  I had like  A leftover sandwich 
[00:47:00]  From  From  From when I had  35 women  In my  My apartment  The other day  I thought you were  Going to say  From 1973  Well  I get a little  Upset  Ready bar for breakfast  Yeah  I get an upset tummy  When I  When I have mayo  Oh is that it  Jimmy's all  Disgusting  Trying to scoop  Egg white  Into my mouth  It's lovely  My tummy's a little upset  I think the mayo  Might be a little bad  Yeah  Because we got the  Sandwiches Friday  What day 
[00:47:30]  Are we up to Tuesday  Oh yeah  That's not good  Tuesday so  And why would you ask  At this point  Why do any of us ask  Because someone leaves  The bathroom  And the first question  Is did you flush  Yeah of course I did  What do you think  I'm an animal  I didn't even ask  If you flushed  I was like  Did you use that  For you know  Yeah the big one  Did you take a dump  Yeah  And I said  Of course not  Of course not  And I walk in  And there it is  Toilet lid open  Just  With pride  He's showing  What he had done  What he had left  Not only do I not 
[00:48:00]  Give courtesy flushes  But I always wipe  The seat down first  I'll wipe the seat down first  And then throw the paper in  And flush before I even sit down  So the view isn't spoiled  Yeah  Yeah  Jimmy knows  It's so bad  What was in the bottom  Looked like it belonged  On a pottery wheel  It was really  Not a good thing  And it smelled awful  The beauty though  Anthony  I don't understand  The flushing  Because every day  It's a surprise  You don't know  What you're going to see  When you're done  I really don't need  To be surprised  Sometimes you're  Completely amazed 
[00:48:30]  And go  Wow  Like  How can I say this  Without getting  Dumped  Where all of a sudden  You're like  Wow  I didn't expect  One of those  Different shapes  And sizes  And twists  And turns  Sure  Things like that  Thank you  No  Looks like a big stole  You throw over your shoulder  Lovely  Electric eel  A giant piece of sushi  So the listeners

[00:59:00]  This segues in  Nicely to this  Story that is  Pretty outrageous  You got a Yankee  Fan charged with  Murder after running  Over a Red Sox fan  Charged with  What?  Murder  Murder  It was a car  Sam  It was a car  Sam  They found a Yankee  Cap  In the front seat  Sam  And a bloody  Red Sox cap  And a hole  In the windshield  What do you think  Happened  Quince  What do you think  Stupid 
[00:59:30]  It was murder  Yeah  Jim C  Sam  Sometimes it's bad  To yell out  Your catchphrase  After only one joke  Because then you  Run out of steam  My girlfriend has an ass  Like the green monster  Sam  That's flat  Wow is that flat 
[01:00:00]  That's awfully flat  Yeah  Does it have scores  On it too  The media making a big deal  About this story  But I think this lady  Had quite a bit  Of problems  Yeah  The least of her problems  Were that she was  A Yankee fan  I'm thinking  Yeah she seemed  A little wacky  Yeah absolutely  Here's the story  Witnesses say  An argument at this  Nashua bar  Over the Yankees  And Red Sox  May have triggered  A Friday night incident  That killed 29 year old  Matthew Bodewin 
[01:00:30]  Police believe  He was run over  By an angry  Drunk driver  After an altercation  Earlier at the bar  When she turned around  She just  Gunned it  Straight for him  He didn't even  Have a chance  To even  Jump out of the way  Or nothing  Matthew Bodewin  Was struck and killed  By the car  In a Nashua parking lot  After he and others  Yelled obscenities  About the Yankees  To 43 year old driver  Yvonne Hernandez  Who had a Yankees  Bumper sticker  On her car  Well  You know 
[01:01:00]  There you go  You have that  Bumper sticker  Up there  You gotta watch out  Who you yell at  I love the Red Sox  I'm not a fan  Of the Yankees  But I'm not  Oh no  What do we got  We got  We got  Man on the street  Stuff now  Incidentally  Can I just point out  I think we got  Man on the street  Stuff  How long you're  Going to lose  Your license  When you intentionally  Drunk drive  And kill someone  In a parking lot  Over a baseball  Argument  I don't know  If that privilege  Will ever be returned  Ah that's six months  A couple grand  And fines easily  Ah perhaps  More than that Jim 
[01:01:30]  Charged  Oh that was  The sign actually  Yes of the crash  Why not  I like turtles  Of course you do  A little kid  Loves turtles  I love the Red Sox  I'm not a fan  Of the Yankees  But I'm not  Going to sit there  And run someone  Over over  A super comet  People who knew  Matthew Boast  You're not a fan then  Yeah you're certainly not  Did that need to be said  No  I'm a fan but  You know  But hey  That's taking it 
[01:02:00]  A little too far  Other fans  That just run people over  Almost like  Well I'll take  The reasonable stance  In the midst of  All this silliness  Like people are debating  Well what's that appropriate  We don't know  Yeah  Should I run people over  I think we better  Debate this  Dummy  I love the Red Sox  I'm not a fan  Of the Yankees  But I'm not going to  Sit there and run  Someone over  Over a stupid comet  Not a fan then  Who knew Matthew  Bodwin are horrified  Someone would run him  Over after such a  Silly argument  But they say  His actions speak  Louder than  Who isn't going to  Be  A couple of people  Who knew him  Said they always 
[01:02:30]  Expected him to be  Mowed down intentionally  By a drunk driver  They just say  Words just come out  It really is nonsense  Nonsense  They say his actions  Speak louder than words  As he tried to shield  His friends  From that speeding car  Matt would be  The type of person  To be a hero  And save his friends  Not thinking that  You know  It would take his life  But knowing that  He saved his friends  Is that's how  Impressed he was  He was always there  For everybody  Screaming obscenities 
[01:03:00]  At the woman  With a group of guys  Sounds like a terrific fella  What a guy  Noxious drunk  Some lady  Just trying to leave the bar  To go home and pass out  He sucks  Oh yeah  Watch this  Yvonne Hernandez  Was initially arrested  For aggravated drunk driving  And reckless conduct  But since Matthew  Bodewin has died  Charges against her  Are expected to be  Updated to include murder  I want her to be alive  Every day  So that she can remember  My brother's face 
[01:03:30]  Hitting her windshield  And that she  What the  Wow  Probably looks like  Freddy Krueger  Coming through the wall  Dumb head  I bet you the head  Went through intact  With the hat still on it  Oh god  Oh that's awful  There was matted glass  And blood  In the hat  Sam  Oh good for him  You know what  That you know  I want her to be alive  Every day  Stuff just doesn't work 
[01:04:00]  It doesn't work  Maybe for the first month  Then you're like  Wow man  I'm alive  Yeah hey  This is great  I'm alive  Yeah it's prison  But it's life  But I get to watch  Gossip Girls  They got it on the  Prison TV  Prison they get TV  Yeah  Three squares  You learn that  You're  You learn that  You were a lesbian  Your whole life  Oh this is great  Three hops in a cot  Right  Shut up  That living  That living every day  Yeah  I'm not a big fan  I don't agree with it 
[01:04:30]  There's gonna be  Plenty of days  Where you're just  Not thinking about  The face coming  Through the windshield  No  You're just  You're doing your job  In prison  You're hanging out  Watching TV  You're reading  You're talking  With people  You're looking forward  To prison movie night  On Wednesdays  Or whatever day  It would be  Not every day  Is like Oz  No of course not  You don't have to worry  Schillinger's gonna  Have some kind of  Inappropriate sex  With you  And then brand a  Swastik on your butt  Tattoo it on there  On a lucky day 
[01:05:00]  I'm sure when that's  Happening you're not  Thinking about the  Face in the windshield  No not at all  Murder  I want her to be  Alive every day  So that she can  Remember my brother's  Face hitting her  Windshield  And that she should  Be happy to even  Be alive in a jail  Cell and have her  Life because I'll  Never be able to  Get my brother's  Life back  It sucks for her  And her family  Obviously  It does well  Your brother shouldn't  Have just screamed  At a stranger in a  Parking lot  People are obnoxious  That is like  Yeah people are  Psychopaths out there 
[01:05:30]  You gotta watch  What you do  Being alive isn't  Enough  I mean I was  Watching you know  As this further  More movement in  The saga of Jim  The menopausal woman  I spent yesterday  Afternoon while you  Were off gallivanting  With the bigwigs  Weeping openly in  My apartment watching  Another HBO documentary  On comas  On comas  What's going on  So so far you  Cried over the one  With the  Peter right  The raping  The rape one 
[01:06:00]  In the Congo  Peter  Peter really got me  Has one with the  Animals being abused  And now you're  Weeping openly  At a coma  I literally wanted  Just a stranger  To walk in  And slap my face  They should have  It was about  Four people  And they follow  Them all coming  Out of comas  And what happens  To them  They stay in the  Vegetative state  Like Shivo is  Vegetative  Or partially unconscious  And about their  Kind of healing  What happens to each  One there's a black  Guy there's a white  Guy there's a  A white teenage girl 
[01:06:30]  And some other  20 year old white dude  Who was beaten up  In Europe  Was the teenage girl  Hot  No I mean the  Vulnerability  I kind of liked  I was just wondering  Well you know  Well that's gotta be  Awful to be in a coma  With those creeps  Walking around the  Hospital probably  You know  Doing those horrible  Things  Well they came out  Of it  But it was like  They'd all come out  Of comas  And it was just  Awful to watch  The families  I swear to god  At one point  I'm like  Come on man  Just say something  I should have  My  I should have 
[01:07:00]  My front legs  Broken  And be just  Shot  Shot in a tent  Your front legs  Because you got  Four  Jimmy  You're a little  Woman these days  What's going on  With you  Is it therapy  Is therapy  Like bringing  Your feelings out  I think so  It's depressing  I'm trying to  Cut the sex stuff  Out  It's very hard  Yeah Jimmy's  Trying to avoid  Like the sex thing  And maybe  Maybe start  Watching comedies  Or something  Yeah watch  Something else  Don't watch  These depressing  Go get Tommy Boy  Comedies will  Depress me more  Because most of  Them aren't good  And the ones 
[01:07:30]  That aren't good  I'm not in  Yeah  Why are I  Not in this  So it kind of  Teared you up  A little bit  Oh there's one  Awful scene  The kid's 20 years old  And he's vegetative  And his parents  Are there  And his older brother  Was there talking to him  And the older brother  Didn't  I guess the cameras  It's a little awkward  But the guy  The guy can't say a word  And his lips  Are just kind of quivering  And he's just like  Staring straight  And then he's just  A tear  Comes down  It's like he knows  Oh my god  In his vegetative 
[01:08:00]  Awful body  And he knows  Something  You're just stuck  In a non-working body  It just  Sucked  You should be able  To take your own life  At that point  How  Yeah how do you do it  Here hold this  Blink  Blink out Morse code  Blink  Kill me  Now  God that's horrid  Who would want to live that way  But they  Brain injuries  You recover very slowly from  Like a year minimum  But you can recover from them  You know they just don't know  Yeah  But they say after a year 
[01:08:30]  If you're still vegetative  You're probably going to stay that way  Like you don't really come out of it  After like a year or two  Your brain's like screwy  It can't regenerate  But it kind of rewires itself  When something's screwed up  Like one part of your brain  It can kind of rewire itself  So it'll use another part of the brain  To do the job that  The other part was doing  Before it got damaged  But it doesn't do it quite as well  And in some cases  It doesn't do it at all  So  You come back like Pet Sematary  Man tries to escape police 
[01:09:00]  Using a golf cart  All right  That's a great story  And they got footage  Where is that guy  What a tool  What a tool  That's like GTA  Well  Were you able to grab a golf cart  In the last one  And drive around  All right  We got to take  An idiot  We got to take a quick break  We'll talk more about this coma thing  Oh Jimmy  You can be okay during the breaks  I hope we don't do something  That gets you a little upset  Believe me  I'm falling apart completely  I'm a mess  It is fun to watch all of us 
[01:09:30]  Go into these different directions  Horrendous  Don't you  I'm saying like  That was a yeah  I completely agree with you  What the hell's happening to us  And it is all of us  I'm in there too  Like the golden girls  We're all losing our minds  We are  I love it  All right  Listen  So a year ago today  The Susan Waldman  That's how we started here  So I think going into break  I want to play one of our favorite things  Roger Clemens admitting using steroids 
[01:10:00]  Or at least it sounds like it  Yeah  I mean you be the judge  Of course  Wink wink  Is that enough of a disclaimer  I hope so  Listen to this as we go to break  I want to say thanks to this Mitchell report  I've been getting emails and questions on this subject  And now the whole world knows  The answer is that I use steroids  Over the last 15 days or so  When I played in Toronto for the Blue Jays  Brian Mack made me use steroids  To inject into my body  And I'm very thankful for those steroids 
[01:10:30]  And it's been extremely difficult  To do this  I'm almost numb to steroids  And human growth hormones  I'm angry about it  To be honest with you  It's hurtful to have thousands of people  To inject human growth hormone  Into my body  My friends  To inject steroids  Into my body  The New York Yankees  To inject human growth hormone  Into my body  My children  Use drugs  And it means a lot to me  In my family  To inject steroids 
[01:11:00]  Again  It's amazing to me  That I have to  Even use steroids  And  I want to say thanks  To Brian McNamee  The New York Yankees  After Christmas  I'm going to sit down  With Mike Wallace  Of 60 Minutes  And I'll inject drugs  Into my body  Right there in front of him  And we'll do all this again  And let me be clear  That I'm very thankful  For those steroids  And  Mike Wallace  Used drugs  Now that that's come out  My children  To inject steroids  Into Mike Wallace  Of 60 Minutes  But we're coming upon 
[01:11:30]  Christmas now  And I have been blessed  In my life  I've been blessed  In my career  And the answer is  That I use steroids  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Waiting for Jim Norton  To join the program  But I think he's having  A good cry  In the bathroom right now  Oh Izzy  Are you alright Jimmy  I'm just assuming  You're having a  A good cry  In the bathroom  Have you weeping  In there  No  Oh he's weeping now  It's part of his craft  And awfulness  Phone number  877-212-018

[01:15:00]  30 seconds  But a substitute teacher  In Pasco County  Says it may have  Cost him his career  So what's the charge  From the school district  Wizardry  Wait a minute  What  Is the teacher  Ripping off Jim Norton  I think so  With his wizardry  I wanna hear  Why was he charged  Why was this man  Charged with wizardry  What'd he do  Well he's a  He's a sorcerer  Wizardry 
[01:15:30]  It's a 30 second magic trick  Watch  Watch  Watch  Watch  Watch  Go  Where a toothpick  Okay  That's a clip  I need  I just need  To have that  Watch  Watch  Watch  Go  That's any creep  That's on the phone  Wow is that a creepy guy  Yeah and that was  That really weird audio  Was him actually showing  The news people  His  Great trick  His wizardry  Oh is that the one  Where he's standing 
[01:16:00]  Behind the kid  And then he goes  With his thumbs  Ta da  What is the trick  Where he holds  A toothpick  With like  His forefinger  Like covering his thumb  And the toothpick  I guess would be like  Wedged in between  His forefinger and thumb  Kind of like if you  Made a fist with it  And you kind of  Tucked your thumb in  So that way the toothpick  Will stick  To your thumb  Because you have it  Pressed in there so hard  And then you  Go like that  And open your hand up  And because the toothpick 
[01:16:30]  Is stuck to the back  Of your thumb  It looks like it disappears  To anybody looking forward  It looks like it's gone  And then you go like that  And it comes back again  I got a great trick  With two toothpicks  I need two toothpicks  For it  What is it  A real one  Yeah  You'll be amazed  I can make a toothpick  Just jump  Really  Jump on another toothpick  You give me a wine cork  I'll do a little trick  Yeah  Everyone knows a little magic  You know  I did the toothpick thing  One time at a party  Where I kept all the little  The meat in the deli sandwich  From tipping over 
[01:17:00]  Let me tell you something  Toothpick tricks  Wow  So do toothpick trick jokes  Yes  Granted  That's not  That's not necessarily a winner  I didn't quite anticipate  It being the dud that it was  Like how you tried to  Pawn it off on the trick itself  Well yeah  Yeah  Like it wasn't  The trick had the lack of talent  Why did he get fired  For this dumb toothpick trick  We're gonna find out now  Yeah  All right  Where a toothpick 
[01:17:30]  Disappears  Then reappears  But after performing it  In front of a classroom  At rushy middle school  Substitute teacher  Jim Piculous  Says  His job  Did a disappearing act  Of its own  I see  Were they regular kids?  They weren't like  Retarded kids or anything  Were they?  No no  They were regular  Just regular kids  That could be understandable  Fritham jumped out the window  I get a call  Toothpick 
[01:18:00]  Came in  One was eating his own shoe  Like you can't do magic  For these kids  They don't get it  The disappearing act  Of its own  I get a call  In the middle of the day  From the head of the supervisor  Of substitute teachers  And Jim  We have a huge issue  You can't take any more assignments  You need to come in right away  When Piculous went in  He learned his little magic trick 
[01:18:30]  Cast a spell  That went much farther  Than he'd hoped  I said  Well Pat  Can you explain to me  What this is?  Can you say anything at all?  You've been accused  Of wizardry  Of wizardry  Wizardry  We're on wizardry  Charged with wizardry  Got accused  Of wizardry?  What the hell's going on?  By who?  I don't know what's going on  With this story  By who?  And how dumb are we?  We're doing a story on this  We have one of the 
[01:19:00]  Most famous magicians  In the world  Is he here yet?  He's not here yet  Oh is he not here yet?  I don't think so  Oh I thought he was in the green room  No no no  I spoke with the assistant superintendent  Of the Pasco County School District  Who said it wasn't just the wizardry  And that Piculous  Had other performance issues  Including not following lesson plans  ED  That's what the toothpicks were for  He'd take two of them around it  Like a splint  Show the children  Ta-da  Salvages a toothpick moment 
[01:19:30]  I like turtles  Yeah  The little kid loves them  Including not following lesson plans  And allowing students to play  On unapproved computers  Accusations Piculous says  He knew nothing about  I think Piculous  I think was embellished  After the fact  To try to cover  What initially  What they were  Saying to me  After the magic trick  Rushy's principal  Requested Piculous  Be dismissed  Now the incident  May have bewitched 
[01:20:00]  His ability  To get a job  Anywhere  Right  We get it  It's a magic story  Get the whole magic thing  We understand  Every word  Has to be some kind of tie in  He's got kind of like  A Harry Potter name too  There  Piculous  I am Piculous  Piculous  I'm Piculous  From Hogwarts  That is a lame ass name  It sounds like  You should be  Fighting in the Coliseum  Yes Piculous  Send out Piculous  He doesn't have a sword  He just has like  One of the little toothpicks 
[01:20:30]  He gets his head  Chopped off immediately  Immediately  Everyone laughs  He attempts to poke  His opponent in the eye  He has a giant  Metal hat on  Metal hat  He tries jousting  With a toothpick  Piculous  It goes all in one  There it goes  Piculous  Piculous  Decapitated  Look at Piculous's head  I still have no idea  What my  Discipline  Involves  Because I have never 
[01:21:00]  Received anything  From the school district  Actually saying  What entails  Leading him to wish  He knew a little more  Abracadabra  Oh alright  Because it's a magic story  Every word  Piculous has pulled out  His toothpick  He is trying to  Hit his opponent with it  Piculous is down  That's how fast  It would be over  Like the big  Talked about magic  Piculous has a  Secret weapon  And it's that  Everybody's like  Piculous sucks 
[01:21:30]  Tooth  He holds it between  His thumb and  Pointer finger  And glad he's got  A huge mace  He's spinning around  He doesn't even  Kill Piculous  Right away though  He just  He bludgeons  Every limb separately  Oh dear lord  Indeed  Stupid Piculous  Let's get back  To Piculous  He knew a little  More abracadabra  At least enough  To get his job 
[01:22:00]  Back  Basically I'm limbo  I'm in limbo  Right now  In Pasco County  Janie Porter  Tampa Bay's  10 News  Now the Pasco County  School District  Also says  As a substitute  Teacher  Piculous was considered  An at will  Employee  That means  The district  Does not need  To have cause  For not bringing  Him back  At all  So why did  The magic trick  Get him  I still don't  Understand the story  Charged with wizardry  It's 2008  It almost sounds like 
[01:22:30]  He had performance  Problems in the past  That were undocumented  And they were trying  To figure out a way  To get rid of this guy  And so they tried  To use this  As an excuse  To get rid of him  For past performance  Problems  But what is this  Just a magic trick  Charged in the 1700s  He was also seen  Consorting with a negro  We'd like him out  Idiots  A giant mound of toothpicks  In Tesla's backyard  That's a prestige joke  If you watch the prestige  You'll get it  If not 
[01:23:00]  Go screw  Well  We could do one more  Before we get  Pendulet in here  The news didn't do  Enough puns  I would have  Preferred a few more  Yeah  Just a couple more  Right Jimmy  Oh they were really  Yeah  Body floats in  New Jersey Canal  Gnawed by turtles  For nearly 24 hours  After police got the call  Gnawed by what  Turtles  By what  Oh no  Like no one knows  What's coming  Hold on to your hats  What did you say Anthony

[01:24:00]  Did not turn it up  After a second call  Searchers found the male body  Floating in the water  On Sunday  Neighbors said a dog  And turtles  Were gnawing on it  Oh god  Do you ever expect  That's how you're gonna  Just be there  When you're dead  Being gnawed by turtles  You're invincible  When you're a teenager  Yeah  And nothing will stop me  And it ends with  A bunch of nips  Nip nip nip nip  They're just nipping at you  Yeah yeah  Because they just nip at you  Nip  They can't really take  Huge great white shark bites  Out of you  Just nipping away

[01:26:30]  Is fine  Oh okay  Yeah  Not gonna bust  That shell open  And watch that  Little Kitner boy's  Pinky  Spill out all over  The dock  See cause it's just  Like a shark  But it's little  And it's a turtle  And it really  Doesn't hurt  A little bit  Of that exaggerated  Humor  Sure it is  We're comparing  A turtle  With a great  White shark  I like turtles  Yeah we know  Shut up  One more animal story 
[01:27:00]  We're on a roll here  Yeah I love it  I think this  A lot of good stories  Today but I think  This could be  My favorite one  Of the day  My favorite one  Of the day  Listen to this  This guy  The dare  To hit a camel  And police say  One guy did  Yeah tonight  He's behind bars  He's accused of  Smacking a camel  At Six Flags  Discovery Kingdom  And then taking off  Six Flags  Six Flags  More Flags  More Fun  Punch Camel  That's a lot of fun 
[01:27:30]  Right there  How do you  Camels are pretty tall  Right how do you  How do you get up  How do you motivate  Yourself to get angry  Enough to swing at  Its jaw  Just a dumb thing  Just stands there  Why would you  Punch a camel  What would the camel  Do to you  The camel probably  Didn't even know  How to react  He'd never been punched  What do you do  Is that affectionate  He's petting me  It's a little hard  But  Yeah  Does it hurt a camel  To punch him  I don't know  I don't think a human  Could really  Where would you  Punch a camel  And that stupid face 
[01:28:00]  You can't really reach up  Look at this  Look at what this  Oh my god  Camels should be punched  Camels are dopey looking  Look at that  Wow  Look at  Google camel  And Google  And get the side view  And get a good side view  Weird stuff going on  That's great  It's not a tumor  It's just a lumpy animal  It spits at you too  Yeah  They're awful  Yeah  And taking off  Yeah  Kind of bizarre  Kind of weird  And kind of sad 
[01:28:30]  You know  We've been saying  Kind of  I think  You can just take  Kind of  Out of that statement  This is the news  Kind of weird  Kind of bizarre  Kind of sad  No it is weird  It is bizarre  And it is sad  Arrested was  A 32 year old  Mongo  Oh wow  Baby  Yes of course  We've been saying  Hit  Slap  Even  Punch  The little baby camel  Those are words  All being used 
[01:29:00]  To describe what  Happened here  Yesterday at the park  And police say  It of course  Scared  The little camel  And the suspects  Didn't even stop  From the hitting  They actually tried  To get away with it  Vallejo police say  This baby camel  Oh if you're going to  Hit a camel  Of course you're not  Going to stand there  And wait to be arrested  Yeah what are you  Going to turn yourself in  It was a baby camel  Yeah  Alright  Now I'm  Now I'm upset  Yeah baby animals  Adorable  That's terrible  They grow up to  Look like  Monsters  But  How big was it  Bastard  It was a baby camel  So it was probably 
[01:29:30]  Like 10 feet tall  Just wait for the cops  I like turtles  Oh my god  We're talking about camels now  Stop it  Vallejo police say  This baby camel  Is the innocent victim  Of a crime  That led to  An unusual arrest  For slapping a camel  On the rear  Hindquarters  You heard right  What  For slapping a camel  What  Vallejo police arrested  24 year old  Christopher Allen  For hitting this baby camel  On Sunday 
[01:30:00]  As part of a dare  At Six Flags  Discovery Kingdom  Why  Was he arrested for that  Because I'm thinking  And I was  Thinking he would  Punch them right in the face  You gotta arrest  A guy for punching a camel  But he hit him  On the ass  One flag  Yeah  It goes down to one flag  You hit camels  When people ride camels  They kind of hit them  On the ass  They give them a little whip  A little whipping  You know  I don't think the camel  Want to be  Part of being a camel  It doesn't want to be 
[01:30:30]  Hit in the ass  I thought he punched him  In the face  Look at that little baby camel  We're looking at a lot of  Images of camels right now  And E-Rock has the observation  That camels look like  The monster from Cloverfield  Yeah  Those legs are a little odd  Cloverfield monster  I love their feet camels  Yeah  Yes  Especially their  Knuckles  And toes 
[01:31:00]  Under bikinis  Let's say hi to Nate  In Maryland  Nate  Yeah what's going on  Hey man  Hey Anthony  You're worried about  A baby camel  But you laugh  When an old lady  Gets punched  The camel wasn't  Wearing a hat  He didn't deserve  To be pummeled  The camel was  Minding its manners  Not like that old  Bitty  With her stupid hat on  The stupid  Mary Tyler Moore hat  She's 101  Well now she knows better  It took her that long  To learn to 
[01:31:30]  Take your hat off  At the hat removal contest  She didn't deserve  To get punched  By that black man  In the vestibule  I'm so glad she did  Oh god  Alright sorry  Hey let's go to Jersey  John you're on the  Opie and Anthony show  What's up  Hey John  Hey  Hey  I'm thinking the guy  Wouldn't  The camel wouldn't  Stop offering the guy's  Cigarette  The camel joe joke  You should call  Z100 at that 
[01:32:00]  They would love that one  Thank you John  Second half of the story  Here  Police say the guy  Enter an area  Off limits to visitors  And parking officials  Say he most likely  Jumped the fence  And then slapped the camel  Police say he and his friends  Were then detained  By park security  For a short while  They then decided  To just take off  And run away from the park  They got into a car  And then let police  On a very short chase  Before finally being taken  Into custody  Vets checked out  The baby camel  And while he was scared 
[01:32:30]  The car was not hurt  And should be fine  Meanwhile police arrested  Alan of Santa Rosa  And the driver of the car  22 year old  Chrissy Thatcher  Who is from the Bay Area  Both of them have had  Run ins with the law before  And now face  Animal cruelty charges  He could possibly  Get jail time  Yes  So Alan  The guy who is accused  Of hitting that baby camel  Is still in the  Soano County Jail tonight  Because police say  He was in violation  Of parole  He is scheduled 
[01:33:00]  To be arraigned  Tomorrow  Back to you  Incredible  What do you have to say  A certain amount of feet away  Did he rape a camel  Yeah  You know  People have had sex  With animals  And they don't get  Into that much trouble  Yeah  I don't think  A little swat  On the ass  Of a camel  Is that big a deal  I can tell you the truth  We got Penn Jillette  Joining the show next  That's going to be  Very very cool  We like this guy  Who is he promoting  Jimmy you know  I'm going to guess  It's the sixth season  Of the show  We can't say it on the air  But it's  Full ass  Full ass  Yeah 
[01:33:30]  It's a really good show  On Showtime  Showtime yes  And he's got  Crackle.com  He has these daily rants  It's a video website  So I'm assuming  It's video not blog  Oh my god  We should play some of those  For him  On XM or something  Give him a little  A little more exposure  Penn Jillette next  Coming to the  Opie and Anthony show  It's the first annual  Baby throwing contest  Stay tuned for details  Well that's you 
[01:34:00]  Yeah that's it  That's for our guest  Penn Jillette  In studio  On the Opie and Anthony show  What's going on man  I'm up too early  In the morning  That's what's going on  Yeah you gotta start  By saying what you said  To Jimmy off mic  Cause that's a huge compliment  And I think the listeners  Need to hear it  Well I didn't want  I didn't want to appear  Like a  But sure of course  I don't watch  Television as a rule  I mean I just  Don't get around to it  Cause I work at night  And stuff  And I don't  As a rule  Care for stand up on TV  I'll go see Gilbert Live  You know  And stuff like that  But I 
[01:34:30]  I just don't think  It's a good form for that  And I was flipping around  Really  Which I do  Maybe once every six months  Happen to see  Jim's show  And couldn't stop watching it  Could not even follow  My rule of clicking it off  I just thought it was  Really smart  And funny  And took me  Because I have  Very bad visual recognition  Took me about 15 minutes in  To realize  Hey oh yeah  I met that guy  I just thought  Where'd this guy come from  It was just so  So polished  And fast  And cool  And I  It was a great special  It really was good 
[01:35:00]  It really was good  And it's very hard  To be in any way  Surprising comedically  Especially with  Obscenity and sexual subjects  Because it's been so well mined  Since Lenny Bruce  That it's very surprising  You know  You got George Carlin  And Lenny Bruce  That completely did all of that  You know  By 1970  Right  And for someone to come in  And have a few different angles  Is a really surprising  Jimmy  Look at that  Huh  Thank you  And Jimmy's gonna be hosting  A show for HBO  Yeah we tape it 
[01:35:30]  In a couple weeks  It's a stand-up show  Four episodes  So hopefully  Oh cool cool  Well it was very very good  And I just liked  I liked the sound  And the texture  And everything  All the stuff  That I usually don't like  Is a rule  Right  There seemed to be  An honesty to it  That  I gotta tell you  Not a fan of  Dancing with the Stars  Well who is  And I wasn't  About 20 million people  I guess  But you  No it's a huge show  But you  Almost  Made me watch it  Oh thanks  Cause I'm  I'm a fan of yours  I don't know 
[01:36:00]  That's sort of a compliment  Sure  I'm like  I hate this show  But Penn Jillette's on it  He might make it interesting  I don't know  Well I was saying  Before we got on  You know  I never saw the show  Before I went on  And people would ask me  You know  How did you go on a show  You'd never seen  I just said  Well it's my job  My job  My job is to sell tickets  And try to get people  To come see  Our little magic show  You don't really need  Exposure  But it is really  Good exposure  It also got  An entirely  I mean we have been  Doing  I mean  Letterman  And Saturday Night Live  Since  I'll probably get the date wrong 
[01:36:30]  But like 1986  Right  Wow  But  Cause I wouldn't do TV  At all  Until I was 30  That was my  Absolute rule  So my 30th  The week of my 30th birthday  I did Letterman  And Saturday Night Live  And so that's  That's about how long  We've been  We've been doing this stuff  And the number of people  That come to see us  At the Rio  That say after the show  Cause you know  We hang out  And talk to folks  Say after the show  We never heard of you  Before Dancing with the Stars  I mean how  Wow  I mean I'm fully aware 
[01:37:00]  I'm not a psycho  I mean in this way  That sounds  I know there were  It's possible  I know there were  6 billion people  On the planet  Right  And if you round it off  6 billion have not heard  Of Penn and Tell  Right  I mean if you round it off  That's the number  If you round it off  Out of 6 billion  How many people  Have never heard of  Penn and Teller  Well  6 billion  6 billion  That's the answer  But if you add it  If you know  The population is actually  6.8 billion  So you say  How many of 6.8 billion  Have heard of them  The answer is still  6.8 
[01:37:30]  6.8  You know  And Elvis  Used to be really  Bothered by the fact  That they were  Aboriginal tribes  That had never heard of them  Never heard of them  Yeah  And the fact is  This is probably not  This is no longer true  It can't be  But 20 years ago  You know  It was still true  That half the people  On the planet  Had never heard of  The United States of America  Which is pretty cool  And of course  Elvis couldn't take that  I'm okay with it  I'm okay with it  So there are  So there are  You know  In the United States of America  Whatever you want to say  320 million people  There are more people 
[01:38:00]  Percentage wise  That have heard of  Penn and Teller  Than globally  But there are these people  And also  They don't even know  This is a whole new demographic  Of you know  Predominantly women  Who watch Dancing with the Stars  And who are predominantly grabby  I mean  I am an unattractive  Big ugly son of a bitch  With a square head  And now I have people  After Dancing with the Stars  Women  Grabbing me  Like grabbing my ass  They want a piece of it  I guess so  Because I was on the show 
[01:38:30]  That they like  Okay we can't grab Jason Taylor  So I have Penn Jillette's here  But it was a nutty nutty experience  And I've also never done a reality show  Where they try to get people to cry  You know  It's essentially  Producers with cameras  Yelling at naive Mormons  Trying to get them to cry  Over what a gay judge said  About their dancing  On television  And it's very weird  To be in a room  Where that kind of emotion  Did you almost break down?  Oh I certainly did  I was sobbing uncontrollably  Yeah sure  Sure you were 
[01:39:00]  But that's one of the things  They reprimand you for  You know  I practiced  Five to six hours a day  I lost 50 pounds  To do the show  I worked really really hard  But they kept saying  You know  You're not emotionally invested  And I said  Well if I became  Emotionally invested  In this show  I would dishonor  My mother and father  You know  Because there's this thing  That happens  That's nuts  Where you've heard people  That talk against pornography  And the completely valid argument 
[01:39:30]  Because it's aesthetic  And not moral or political  Is that somehow  Having sex  Is a very powerful  And personal emotional feeling  And watching people do it  In an environment  That's not true  Somehow cheapens that  And that argument  Is not one that I've ever felt  But it's a valid argument  Because it's aesthetic  You can't argue with it  But I've never felt that  But reality shows  Make me feel that  When I see someone crying  On a reality show  I go  You know  I was crying 
[01:40:00]  At my mom and dad's funeral  And that seemed valid  And this  Someone yelling  At someone in a room  And doing take after take  Until they break  Just seems not morally wrong  Right  It's just not my favorite thing to watch  Of course not  Of course not  When you're part of it  When you're sitting there  With the camera  The guys looking at you  And going  We're really supposed to  Get you to say this  And you go  But I don't want to say that  Okay  But we should have a script  I thought this was a reality show  And people also say  You know  Oh we were so upset  When you were off so early 
[01:40:30]  And I go  It's a god damn TV show  You know  It's kind of like someone saying  I was so upset  When you were shot  On Law and Order  You know  In the first ten minutes  Yeah  That's what the script says  That's what I'm supposed to do  Could you dance before that  Or you like start  No I've never  I've never  I went to  Ringling Brothers Barnum  The Greatest Show  On Earth Clown College  Which you can tell  Because I have to say  Ringling Brothers Barnum  The Greatest Show  On Earth Clown College  Because that was part  Of our media class  And during that  We had to do  Production numbers  Because you know  Virtually every clown is gay 
[01:41:00]  So why not  And so they made us  Take certain dance clubs  But I followed the rules  Were you a clown?  I was never in  Ringling Brothers Barnum  The Greatest Show  On Earth  I went to Clown College  And was extraordinarily bad  I mean it turns out  That I was a  Very good juggler  Unicyclist  Wire walker  And  But when it came  To being funny physically  If you've seen  The Big Ben and Teller Show  I do the whole time  My hands in my pockets 
[01:41:30]  Just talking  Teller  I don't even move  Or hold anything  So I don't know  Why I thought  I could be a visual  Comedian  Except for the fact  That I'm from  A small town  In Massachusetts  And never met  Anyone in show business  Or never even saw  A live show  As a child  Wow  So I just figured  Oh well there's this place  You can go  And learn to do stuff  And I'm a really good juggler  So maybe I can  You know  Cheat my way in  So you did  Wire walking  There's a documentary  On Philippe Petit  I think  Oh sure  I knew  Oh you know  I want to  I haven't 
[01:42:00]  I haven't  Knowing him would be  Probably too strong to say  But I met him  Way back  Right when he did  The Twin Tower  We're obsessed with  What he did  Yeah that was amazing  We brought that up  On our show  A few months back  And just  Much easier now  It's right on the ground  Very very bad test  Too soon  It's a wire walking joke  It's a wire walking joke  That's a great joke  But there was  You've got to be insane  To do that  There was a wonderful juggler  Who's dead now  Named Francis Brun  Who was a French juggler 
[01:42:30]  Which is I mean  Two words that nothing good  Could come up  Right  French juggler  You're over there going  Oh boy  Where can I see him  You mean a French guy  And he juggles  Oh damn  He's dead  Because that would be  Something I'd run out to see  It's like  It's on my bucket list  There was a movie  Called Jesus of Montreal  You know  Out a long time ago  And I went to see it  And afterwards  I went  What made me see that movie  Of  Is that the word  Of that movie  Of  I was just  Oh I gotta see a movie  With of in the title 
[01:43:00]  But Francis Brun  I was in New York City  And it was  I don't remember  The exact year of the WAP  But 73, 74  Around there  Maybe 75  I think it was 74  And I was just  Moving to New York  And just living here  And juggling all the time  You know the juggling scene  And I was out with  The greatest juggler  Of the time  Who was Francis Brun  And he said  I want you to meet  Philippe Petit  He's gonna walk  Between the Twin Towers  Oh you knew ahead of time  Yeah  And I went  What?  Yeah  I think he's gonna walk  But it was all  You know  Totally illegal 
[01:43:30]  And everything  And I kind of went  Yeah  You know  Because I just got to New York  And I thought  That's the kind of thing  That happens  People go up to you  And go  You know  Buddy  Guy's gonna walk  Across the Twin Towers  Come here  That didn't happen  In my hometown  You know  It wasn't like  It was one story  But you know  The highest building  But that kind of like  Excitement of  We know someone  Who's gonna do  Something illegal  Crazy  And so I didn't go down  And see it  Because I suppose  I don't know  I probably didn't know  How to get there  But I heard about it  It was really fascinating  He was a wonderful  He still is I suppose 
[01:44:00]  A wonderful street performer  He was just in the paper  Like doing some  Tightrope thing  In a park  Watching a square park  Yeah like six feet  Off the ground  No but the  See  What?  Six feet off the ground  What he  What  What Philippe did  Was a lot of  Slack wire walking  And slack wire  Is fascinating  Because there's  There's  Tight wire  And slack wire  And slack wire  Is much much  More difficult  But the second thing  That's more surprising  Is it's more dangerous  The six foot slack wire 
[01:44:30]  You're more apt to flip  And go around  And break your neck  Of course  Falling from the  World Trade Center  Yeah  It could be a problem  The people that have  Survived that  Is a very small number  I think actually  A smaller number  That have heard  Of Bennett  It's horrifying  About what he did  Between him and  Towers  Mind  And the moving  The swing  When he just decided  In the middle of it  To lay down  To lay down  On his back  And look at  I thought maybe  There was a bear  Too  A bear  On the other side  A wire walking  Bear after you  It's obvious  Obviously 
[01:45:00]  It's one thing  To walk with  But you got the  Big pull and stuff  And he sort of  Knows what he's doing  But to actually decide  I need to lay down  In the middle of this  That's what  Completely horrifies me  Just thinking about  Just to make this clear  To your listeners  He didn't just decide  To lie down  It was part of his act  Right  Yeah  How do you get down  With your foot hanging  And your holding  On your back  And like you're looking up  And how do you  Boost yourself back up  Well I mean  How do you boost 
[01:45:30]  Yourself back up  My palms are sweating  Right now  You have to have  You have to have  Good calf muscles  Yeah  You gotta work  On the calves  It was  What killed me  About that  Was that there was  So much sway  You know  There was so much sway  I wish there was video  You're walking  There's none  There's just  Still pictures  And going into the building  With crossbow equipment  Hidden on your body  I mean that's  Yeah right  Well it was before 9-11  There you know  You got away with murder  Before 9-11  You could just walk  Into any one of these buildings 
[01:46:00]  We used to check  We used to crossbow  If there was ever  If there was ever  Something you could prove  Was before 9-11  I think that's it  Right  We should  At our last gig  At NAW  You said it like  It was information  You know  That was before 9-11  But at our last gig  At NAW  We would be bored  Waiting to start  Our afternoon drive show  And we would like  Start exploring  Some of these buildings  Around you  And we would get  On the roofs  Like it was nothing  Yeah  And check out the view  Can't do that anymore  No  You're barely  Taken out by a helicopter  Yeah 
[01:46:30]  You mean most anyone  Not just you personally  Anyone can do it  Yes  I thought maybe you thought  They came down  On you personally  Harder after 9-11  And I was going to say  The complexion  They are  Probably not  Well we roll our eyes  Because you can't even  Get in a building  Without showing like  ID  It's like  What's that about  What are you stopping  Shut up  You go to LA  That's also  That's also just  The buildings  Thinking they're so important  Right  You know  Terrorist organizations  All over the world  Are trying to get  To the food network  You know  We'll hit them  Where it hurts  But terrorists  Will show their ID 
[01:47:00]  They use their own name  Of course they do  Had his own passport  Yes  Nothing that TSA does  Would have stopped  Anything on 9-11  It's just this eroding  Of the rights  Because of fear  It's nothing to do with  You know  Benjamin Franklin said  That you know  To paraphrase  Those that would  Sacrifice liberty  For safety  Deserve neither  And the fact of the matter  Is that we are  Sacrificing liberty  And not even getting  One scintilla  Of more safety  It's insane  People are so willing  To give up their rights 
[01:47:30]  Well it's important  Yeah  Under the guise of safety  And then they just  It just keeps happening  Like they don't  You don't just give up  One right  And then go  Okay well that's the only  Right we have to give up  But then another one  Goes away  And kind of act like  At the time of the  Founding of this country  Things weren't dangerous  You know  Like  Oh those guys  Could be for freedom  But we've got to be  More careful  Because now it's  Much more dangerous  Like all of us  Aren't covered with sores 
[01:48:00]  And dying in the mud  And being shot at  Every second of our lives  You know  We try to act like  We aren't cowardly  We are absolutely cowardly  Brave men and women  Founded this country  And we are pissing it away  It's like  They were willing to die  For our freedom  And we're going  Yeah but we get scared sometimes  Yeah let's throw that right away  They thought it out  They really put something behind it  Fought and died for it  Ah let's just toss that one out 
[01:48:30]  Well now things are different  Yeah  Now things are different  You know our founding fathers  Never expected  This to happen  Or this  I got to say  As devil's advocate  Though back then  The threat of losing  3,000 in a clip  Wasn't a real threat  I mean it's like  Back then it was like  You had individuals  You had problems  I'd have to see  I'd have to see the numbers  Of the revolutionary war  Revolutionary war  I think I'm going to find you wrong  Oh no that was a bad one  But I mean just like  In any one particular moment  Well I don't know  I mean you do have 
[01:49:00]  Even as late  As the early 20th century  You have simply the flu  That gave many many  Many more people than that  And we also do have  We don't have ever  A terrorist attack  On American soil  But we do have  I mean the Civil War  Losing 3,000 in a clip  Was pretty easy  Well yeah  But that was  It was really a rights violation  The North fight in the South  Was just the North fight in the South  I don't know  Have we lost any rights  Like I get annoyed  At TSA as well  I get very irritated 
[01:49:30]  But have we lost  Any real basic rights  Well that would be  That would be called  The Fourth Amendment  That would be called  Search and seizure  Now you're actually  Going onto an airplane  You don't have to be searched  Because you don't have to  Go onto an airplane  But that's for legal scholars  To argue  I  We mostly settled down  In Las Vegas  And stopped touring  I was on the road  For 30 years  And I loved it  I mean  Keith Richards  Billy Gibbons  Penn Jillette  The only three people  Who have ever enjoyed  Being on the road  And eventually  That will be the band  But 
[01:50:00]  We settled down  In Vegas  Not because I wanted  To have a family  And not because  We were getting too old  To be on the road  But just because  I couldn't stand  To see old ladies  Tossed  Because I was in China  You know  And I was over there  In China  In 99  You know  And I was smug  That we were Americans  Because at the airports  They had cats with Uzis  And all you know  People being searched  All over  And I would just  Kind of go  Well you know  It's good that we live  In a country  And I came back here 
[01:50:30]  In our crew  Which you know  They listen to your show  All the time  Nate and the boys  They're all freedom fighters  So every time  We went through security  One of us  Was getting cuffed  You'd never know  Who it was going to be  That was going to  That makes it exciting  You know  It would be like  You know  I'd be really cool  And really comfortable  Tell them to be cool  And comfortable  But all of a sudden  The light guy's going  Get your hands off  What are you doing  You know  And then you go  Another two weeks  We were flying like  Five times a week  Another two weeks  And all of a sudden 
[01:51:00]  For some reason  It's my turn  And all of a sudden  The guy goes  Show me under your belt  Okay see everything  And I drop my pants  And all of a sudden  They're going  You exposed yourself  To TSA  And they're taking me  To the back  And I'm going  I had underwear on  If I expose myself  You'd know it  And there's another thing  They're yelling  And so  We don't have a sense  Of humor  What's so hard  I don't want them  To have a sense of humor  I want them to go away  I think  I think if you want  To have freedom  You have to be willing  To take some chances  Not at 30,000 feet 
[01:51:30]  I'll take them here  But at 30,000 feet  I get very nervous  But you know  The give me liberty  Or give me death  If you were to even say that now  In an airport  You would be detained  True  And yet that is one of the important  I mean can you imagine  How heavy it is  To say give me liberty  Or give me death  I'm willing to die for freedom  I mean that is like  One of the heaviest things  Ever said in the world  And we are just  Pissing it away  I would love  To hear people say 
[01:52:00]  You know  I'm willing to die  If I can have more freedom  And I'm willing to die  For others to have freedom  And I know that's  A heavy thing to say  But man  Wouldn't it be great  To rise to that standard  That was set by the founding fathers  I do think protecting us  On a plane  Isn't a removal of freedom  But you're so much safer  On a plane  Than you are at Starbucks  I mean first  Get that out of the way  It's just your fear  You're safe on a plane  And it's fine  I mean  I've been in two crash landings  And they're just really cool  And exciting  Oh my god 
[01:52:30]  I've gone down  You know the rubber raft  That comes out  I've slid down  The god damn thing  What was the reason?  Nothing  It was a complete mistake  Some of the things went out  And the stewardess came over  Flight attendant  Oh flight attendant  I'm so sorry  I said stewardess  I wish I were dead  Flight attendant came over  And she woke me up  And she said  We're going to do  An emergency landing  And I said  Cool  And she said  You don't seem scared at all  I said I'm not scared  If we're going to crash  It'll be hip  And she comes over to me  And she's like trembling  Holding the book 
[01:53:00]  And I go  Well let me see that  I'll look at it  And I'm looking through  And I'm going  Well I can certainly  Get the door open  I can certainly do this for you  That'll be really cool  And this flight attendant  Who was very overtly gay  Was in the cabin with me  I was in first class  Of course  And he was there  And he said to the flight attendant  I'm not working on this flight  But I am a flight attendant  I know this stuff  And I said  Okay well we'll work together  Because the flight attendant  Was kind of freaking 
[01:53:30]  And it was like 10 minutes  We knew beforehand  We were coming into this  Closed airport in Texas  What was the problem  With the plane  Did they tell you  Nothing  Nothing  As a matter of fact  I talked to the pilot  We were stranded  Kind of a false alarm  We were stranded  And he said  If this instrument goes out  We have to do  An emergency landing  And he said  I knew that the instrument  Was out  And nothing was wrong  With the plane  But the rules say this  He was also a nom vet  And he could have landed  He could have landed  No wings  Wings  Wings are for pussies  He could have just landed  And 
[01:54:00]  But  I said to the  Of course  And I did say this  Because I just thought  It was really funny  I said to the  Flight attendant  The one that was off duty  The gay gentleman  I said  If there's a good chance  We're going to crash and die  I'm going to have sex with you  I said  If we see any fire  Or any smoke  I said  Let's start  Because I've always thought  That I wanted to have sex  Within 10 minutes of dying  And you're the one  You're the only one  And he said  I'm fine with it  And I said 
[01:54:30]  Okay  Well that'll be the plan  And then we got carried away  In all the emergency planning  But it's pretty cool  To take that seatbelt  And pull it as tight as you can  I mean  So it hurts  And you can't breathe  Take off your glasses  Your headphones  Take off all your jewelry  And just roll up in a ball  And then land normally  And you feel like a schmuck  You feel like an idiot  Right  But you know  It is pretty cool  To just say to yourself  Well you know  This could be it  This could be  This could be the end  It's nutty  But I had no more fear of flying  Why aren't you scared of flying? 
[01:55:00]  Because as my mom said  Know nothing, fear nothing  I think  I've never been a particularly  Timid person  It's uh  You know  It's a big cliche  But it is safer  Yeah  Than driving  They had zero fatalities  In the United States  On commercial airlines  Last year  Last year  For the first time in a while  Yeah but tell that to Buddy Hawley  Exactly  You know  You should mention  Penn Says  Because otherwise  Yeah we  Well you've been  You know  I know  I'm sorry  Maybe you should have  Promoted your own stuff 
[01:55:30]  This is Crackle.com  Because I certainly  Can't get a word in here  What is  Penn Says  Is daily rants  On Crackle.com  Yeah that's all it is  It's just  When I had a radio show  I miss your radio show  I told you last time  I used to listen here in New York  Well the best part  The best part of having a radio show  Is having something to say  And being in front of a mic  Right  The worst part is having nothing to say  And being in front of a mic  Which you guys have never experienced  But I certainly did  Ask our listeners  And uh  Hey  Can we take a quick break  Sure do whatever you want  How much more time you got  I don't know  I gotta go somewhere  But I like to talk to you  Regis or something 
[01:56:00]  No I'm not doing Regis  I'm doing something  I know you're doing Letterman  We're doing Letterman Friday  Which was actually yesterday  Magicians week  Yeah we do  Your appearance will be  We already  Friday show  Cool  Can he hang  I'll try  I'll do some at least  Alright a few more minutes  With Penn Jillette  After the break  Opie and Anthony  Hey it's the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:56:30]  We're having a good time  With Penn Jillette  Let's not forget  Penn Says  That's Daily Rants  On crackle.com  Also the website  Pennandteller.com  And also a brand new season  Of BS  Bull S  On Showtime  It's what  The 6th season Penn  Yes it's the 6th season  We're now the longest running show  In Showtime's history  We're big fans actually  What are you doing on this season  We're doing World Peace  We're doing Dolphins 
[01:57:00]  We're doing Sensitivity Training  We're doing  Sensitivity Training  Now you're talking about  We're all for it  Of course we're for it  Stupid Sensitivity  We got John Rocker on  Oh really  To talk about that  Nice  Which is pretty cool  You want to talk to a cat  Who's bitter  And you do  That's the guy  Sensitivity Training  Is the biggest joke  What are you really  But I was really happy  About doing Dolphins  Because Dolphins  You know  Everybody  Everybody talking about 
[01:57:30]  You know  They're these mystical creatures  Who are smarter than us  Yeah yeah  Smarter than us  They just happen to live in the water  And our point of view on this  Is technically mammals  Morally fish  That's our point  You know  A little fur around the blowhole  Does not make you a mammal to me  You know what I mean  I need more than little fur  Around your blowhole  To prove it to me  Do they really have a little fur  Around their blowhole  Sure  I'm so surprised  You don't know that  What's that about  Of all the people 
[01:58:00]  That would know that  And have video  We should know that one  Yeah you should know that  I prefer they shave it  Make some look younger  Put your lips a little  And the thing about the show  I like so much  And I haven't seen  The later ones  I was just telling  Tom Penn during the break  Is I love the fact  That it's a very  It's not an angry  Destruction of these people  Which makes it effective  It's like  It's just an accurate  Showing  Of what they're doing  That's crap  What I say very proudly  Is there's no ambushing 
[01:58:30]  You know  What I like to say  About our show  Is that we are  We are fair  And very biased  Which is what I think  People should be  I would love it  If newscasters came out  And said  I hate George Bush  And here's the news  Because that helps you  Get a point of reference  And if you're going  To be on the show  We tell you  The name of the show  We tell you  That we disagree with you  And we give you a DVD  Of us being as mean  As possible earlier  And then you decide  To go on the show  And we don't ever  Pull people out of context  And so you get 
[01:59:00]  To say your point  And then afterwards  I'll swear at you  And I'll attack you  And rip you to pieces  But you know  I went on a  Nostradamus show  As the skeptic  And I said to them  You know  As long as you don't  Quote me out of context  As long as you get  To say my piece  You can rip me apart  After that  If you believe  What you're saying  You're okay with that  Nostradamus  That stuff  What do you think  What do you think  What do you mean  What do I think  When you just said  The name of my show  What do you think  I think  A guy says 
[01:59:30]  A river will overflow  Its banks  And that's predicting Hitler  You need the name  Hitler in there somewhere  Did he call him  Hister or was that a myth  He called him Hister  Was it a myth  Or it's true  The translations  Get all confused  But once you know  Something  See the trick  Of prediction  Is you have to  Know it in advance  What you can do  With any sort  Of prediction  Is you can  Once it happens  Go back and say  Here's what they meant  With poetry  And that's the definition  Of poetry  I mean Bob Dylan  Doesn't know you 
[02:00:00]  And doesn't sing  About your personal life  And yet you listen  To his songs  He describes exactly  What happened to you  Because they're  Emotional cornerstones  It's the same thing  With Nostradamus  He's saying stuff  That poetically  Is true about  The human heart  And then after  The stuff happens  You go back  And look at it  But in order to be  A good prediction  You have to tell me  Ahead of time  And the real question  About anybody predicting  Is everybody who claims  To be psychic  All of you  All I will say to you  Is where were you  September 10th 2001 
[02:00:30]  Because if you are psychic  And you shut up that day  Then we need to put you  In prison  And if you didn't know  Then you aren't psychic  And those are your  Two choices Jack  There's not another one  Because all I care about  Is September 10th 2001  You would have been  The king of the psychics  That would have been  A hell of a story for you  If you would have  Came out and said  Hey  Tomorrow's the day  Just to pull you out  Of show business  For a second  Psychics doesn't matter  You would have saved  American life  He's going 
[02:01:00]  He's going back  What a great style  Like that would have been  How famous would you get  If you did that  I also love that  In your fantasy  It's not stopped  It's just like  A told you so  Not because you've been  Talking on the radio  With no one listening  To a word you say  For so many years  You just figure  Well you'd predict it  No one would do anything  Then imagine  The giant told you so  You'd have  That's your whole fantasy  That's what you're thinking about  Is it would just be  A told you so  There's no sort of 
[02:01:30]  Heroism in this room  Whatsoever  Like I would know this  And I would go and stop it  And save these lives  No  I'd come back on the 12th  And say  Nah nah nah nah nah  See  See  See this is the tape  I made on it  September 10th  I'm holding up the newspaper  To prove I said this  Alright good point  As I turn right in front of everybody  You're an awful human  That was just  An absolute  That was your character  Yeah  That proves what type of person  You are right there  You know I 
[02:02:00]  I want to say for the record  I had nothing to do with that  You did it all on your own  That's what I mean  But thanks for pointing it out  And really rubbing it in  I just want to tell you  What every single person  Listening to you was thinking  What is wrong with that guy  Sound bite  I didn't even catch that  But in your fantasy  It's not stopped  There  And then you were  You were talking about  Global warming with Anthony  Anthony doesn't believe  In the global warming  It's a tough one  I just don't know  That's what it is too  Every single part of it 
[02:02:30]  Seems jive to me  I don't believe Al Gore  I don't believe any of this  I don't believe the way  This stuff comes  But I can't say no  I can't say absolutely  Like who the hell am I  To say yes or no  At this point in history  I don't think  If we're sitting here  Underwater someday  I'll go wow  Maybe they were right  About those ice caps  There's many different points  That are all mushed together  First of all  Is the world getting hotter  Is that a bad thing  Right  Did humans cause it 
[02:03:00]  And if humans caused it  Can humans reverse it  Which is a big big thing  And can they do it  By conservation  You and I  Can take an 18 wheeler  On top of a hill  We can put it in neutral  And we can push  And start that down the hill  That doesn't mean  You and I can stop it  Right  So you know  Once you've said  We caused this  Even if you get that far  You're not necessarily saying  We can stop it  And do we have to  And if you can stop it  Do we want to  Do we have to  And also  If we can stop it  Is it by conservation 
[02:03:30]  Which has never worked  On anything ever  In the world  Wouldn't it be by  It's going to be by  Some smart guy  Who goes  Why don't we blow  This thing up  Because the solution  To everything  Is always  Why don't we blow  This thing up  You know  Maybe we'll do  Some sort  So there's a lot  Of questions  As far as global warming  Goes  Our favorite visual  Is where they show  Manhattan underwater  Like it's going to  Get to that point  Like we're not  We're going to start  Seeing puddles  No the best part  Of that though  Is they show it  With cars underwater  And things  Like it would happen 
[02:04:00]  So fast you'd be  Stuck in it  Like it doesn't happen  Over the course  Of many years  Like when the puddles  Start forming  We're not going to  Try to figure out  What to do  I think we got to leave  There are puddles  Yeah  It's like puddles  On 57th  We should probably  Leave Manhattan  Or build a wall  One guy would think  Of getting a boat  At least one guy  Is going to go  They show Manhattan  With 20 foot  Like you know  Lakes now  In the middle of  Manhattan  With cars floating  And the thing  That really disturbs me  Is that Al Gore  Said in an interview  That he did exaggerate 
[02:04:30]  Really  He says  I exaggerated  To make my point stronger  And once you say that  And you're not a comic  You know  If you're a comic  Fine  You know  As Otto and George  Always say  I exaggerate  In order to clarify  That's fine  But once someone  That's supposed to be  Giving me the truth  Says that  Once they say  Well of course  I exaggerated a little  And they knew it in advance  Not saying I was wrong  I made a mistake  But saying  I kind of knew  I was pushing it  A little bit  Like when the  We were involved 
[02:05:00]  In Broadway Cares  We do a lot of stuff  With AIDS  You know  Not helping AIDS  But helping people  With AIDS  Because helping AIDS  Would be  Terrible  Penn and Teller  Handing out dirty needles  But when that first hit  You know  And I was one of the people  Who was speaking out  And saying  We should do something  About this  I wasn't one of the first  But I mean  Saying that  A lot of people  Involved in that thing  Would say  Well we have to make it  Very clear  It's going to spread 
[02:05:30]  To the heterosexual community  You know  To scare people  And get their help  And I said  No  We have to have compassion  And if it's only killing  One segment of the population  You don't lie about it  You say  These are people  That need help  Let's help them  There's this sense  Of people  Trying to  Elicit help  From people  That says  That lying's okay  Because other people  Aren't as compassionate  As me  And the truth  Of the matter is  Everybody's as compassionate  As you  Just tell them the truth  And that's what's going to  That's what bothers  People like us 
[02:06:00]  Are getting off  The global warming thing  Just because of the style  That's used  By the people  Who believe it  And if they're right  We're wrong  To not believe them  But they're also wrong  For exaggerating  And pushing  And showing video  Of you know  Manhattan underwater  With cars still going  With cars there  They wouldn't pull them out  Ted Kennedy's still driving  We were told  We gotta get you out  By 850  Because you've got  Somewhere else to go there  Well actually  We're ending the show too  So it works out 
[02:06:30]  Okay  Yeah it would be silly  Yeah I know  For either one of us  To stay here  Yeah that's a good point  Show's done  You're leaving  Penn it's always a pleasure  Penn says  Daily rants  On crackle.com  I did not know about this  I'm gonna go there  Later on this afternoon  And check it out  What are some of your rants  That we can look forward to  On that website  Well the one that got me  The most interest I suppose  Was one I did about  Hillary Clinton  That Maureen Dodd  And the New York Times  Ended up doing a column about  Because I went out  And did a joke  Like an anti-Hillary joke 
[02:07:00]  That was a sucky joke  What was the joke?  It was a joke that said  You know this was a while ago  Obama did really well  In February  And Hillary said  That's not fair  Because February's  Black History Month  And she's right  She's doing a lot better  Now that it's  White Bitch Month  Which is not  You know that's just  By the numbers  That's nothing there  But what shocked me  About it was  I went out the first night  To do it  And I figured  I don't really do  This kind of political stuff  On our show  And it's during  A newspaper tear  It's during a magic trick  To throw away  A few people are gonna go like  A few people will laugh 
[02:07:30]  And then we'll just move on  It stopped the show  With people cheering  Like  He's a hero  Build a statue  And the crew was backstage  Going  What's going on?  And I went backstage  And went  Even the people  That support her  Hate her  It's astonishing  And I did this whole rant  Going  Listen I'm not proud  Of this joke  I'm not gonna do it  That much anymore  I don't care about the joke  It's not interesting  My input doesn't matter  It's the fact 
[02:08:00]  That people are going  Yeah  White bitch  Yeah  Right  Right  Like I  You know what I mean  I could all of a sudden  Hit this like nerve  And Dave Barry  You know  Who's a funny guy  He wrote me an email  After it was in the column  Going  I had the same experience  I have this Hillary joke  That's not great  It's just fine  And I do it  Like even  For democratic crowds  And they go crazy  So you've got someone  Wait was she attacking you  In the times or no?  Maureen Dodd was just saying  Her point was  Penn is shocked 
[02:08:30]  At doing a stupid joke  Like this  And having to get a reaction  Why is that?  I mean  How bad can you be doing?  She was essentially  My exact point of view  She certainly wasn't  Supporting the joke  Which neither was I  It was just like  You know  I need a joke  To put in here  Oh one of our crew guys  Says that  I go  That's funny  I'll throw it in  And I expected nothing  It really was  It was applause  You know  The woman running  For president is a bitch  Oh yeah  About time  That got said  Yeah  We never noticed that  Before  I mean it was amazing 
[02:09:00]  What do you like  For the presidency?  Do you care?  Do I get choices  Other than  Yeah good point  Yeah I think  What I like about Obama  I'm amazed that  These are the choices  What I like about Obama  Is he doesn't seem cynical  And that's the only thing  I liked about George W. Bush  Cynicism  You know  Really breaks my heart  And the Clintons  Have always seemed  Incredibly cynical to me  And Obama seems like  If not him  Then many of his supporters  Actually believe 
[02:09:30]  What he's saying  You know  You're pissing off Ant  Why?  I'm just  A little controversy  I liked Obama  A little more  Watching the CNN  Interview with him  Last night  But I don't know  How sincere he is  I don't know either  Because he's a politician  But you know  But you know  What I mean  Yeah  When  With the last election  You couldn't find  Anybody that liked  Kerry  They just hated Bush  You couldn't find  Anybody that liked Bush  They just hated Kerry  There are some people  I've met  That like Obama  And that's a beautiful thing  I disagree with him 
[02:10:00]  On everything  Yeah  That's it  But  Looking someone in the eye  And saying they like  A presidential candidate  Fills me with joy  If he's actually  Sincere  About really wanting  Change  In the country  Then I'm a blue nose  Gopher  Yeah  Yeah  It's just  I can't buy that  I really can't  The guy's  A politician  Is a politician  I'm sorry  You talk to people  Who were for Kerry  You know  Yeah  And they were always  For Kerry  With all these caveats  And all this  You've met somebody 
[02:10:30]  I'm sure in your life  That says they like Obama  Oh hell yeah  Isn't that beautiful  I mean  You don't mean anyone  That likes Hillary  No  Even people voting for him  Everyone hates Hillary  I like Obama  And I would never  I would never go Democrat  I like Obama  And you know something  Something about him I like  That's going to put him  Over the top  Yeah  That's what they've been  Waiting for  I agree  Because McCain  People look at him  And go  He seems like  He's probably a hero  Whatever  But he's too old  I don't want to see  An old white guy  I'm just kind of tired of it  You know  I want to see something different  There you go  We got to get Penn out  Yeah  And we got to go

Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell. 
[02:13:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  You've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator in all these problems?  Opie and Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off  so that bag shows through where icing was.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:13:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  It's showtime.  We, uh...  Wow, that was weird, huh, Ant?  Very, very strange.  We barely made it in time for the XM portion of the show  because we ran into an old PD.  An old friend.  An old friend.  An old friend.  I gotta say, in a weird way, it was nice to see him.  Really? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  We just ran into the ice cream PD for the people that linger longer.  On the streets of Manhattan.  In between here and K-Rock.  What was the ice cream PD?  Because I'm here and I don't even know what that is.  He was our first PD when we moved to New York ten years ago this summer.  And he's called the ice cream PD because during a very heated moment on the show  when he should have been there and paying attention and being involved and backing us up  and doing whatever, you know, a PD does for the popular show on the station. 
[02:14:30]  He came in oblivious to what was happening, licking an ice cream cone, going,  Hey, what's up, guys?  And we're like, what's up?  Where have you been the last two or three hours?  We're at war here.  Yeah.  We were taking on K-Rock, actually.  Yeah.  Hold on.  A little distraction.  We'll get back to that in a second.  Leo in Cleveland.  Leo.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, I'm in Cleveland driving to work.  When you guys go off, I turn on Rover. 
[02:15:00]  And he's on there talking bad about you fellas.  Oh, really?  Hold on.  Let's hear the audio.  What's he saying?  Yeah, what is he saying?  He's saying, you know, saying that when they kicked him off the air in Chicago, CBS was courting him to go to New York because they wanted to bounce you guys because you were doing so poorly.  He's saying that, you know, the stations you have listed on your Wikipedia page, you've been dropped from.  You know, he went through and making a laundry list of cities that you're no longer on the air. 
[02:15:30]  Is that what he's resorting to?  It's kind of sad because I really, we understand the radio game.  We understand it's filled with just, like, douchebags.  And, yeah, we've got to hear the audio.  But I swear to God, I was thinking to myself that Rover would probably be an exception to the rule and he would actually, like, just do his show and compete fairly and not go down that road.  Right.  Because we had a pretty good relationship with the guy.  Well, you guys share an agent, don't you? 
[02:16:00]  We share an agent, which just drives me nuts because half these guys got our agent because of the success Ant and I had here in New York.  And if he's going down that road, it's kind of sad because he knows we had a really good relationship.  He knows, like, when we came to Cleveland and broadcasted live from the same station as he was on, you know, we all got along.  He knows I took him out to lunch and he was asking all sorts of questions about Anthony and I's success.  I mean.  Yeah.  And I swear to God, I really thought, you know, for once, I think one of these radio guys is just going to, like, you know, not go down the road of trashing somebody just because we don't work for the same company anymore. 
[02:16:30]  And as far as, like, replacing us in New York, that is so, so not true.  Yeah, that's just a lie.  We need to hear some audio of that.  Can we get audio of that somehow?  Yeah, as long as we.  It's roverradio.com.  I think you can stream it.  Okay.  Well, he's done saying it.  I'd like to hear him actually saying that stuff.  And Jimmy, you know, he's a touring comic. 
[02:17:00]  He's been on Rover's show many, many times in the last couple of years.  I've never, not only have I been on a show, I've never bad-mouthed him, and we defended him vehemently against that scumbag Maxwell.  Right, yeah.  Who is an unfunny, no-talent scumbag who does afternoons in Cleveland.  And I've always said that since the day we heard him.  You guys have said it, and I mean it.  It's not even a radio bit.  He's an unfunny, no-talent scumbag.  Right.  Not funny.  But he was attacking Rover all the time, and we defended Rover. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  And now they're on the same station, Jimmy.  No, and I understand that, like you've got to make up, but I'm not saying that.  But now don't start trashing this show when we were defending you.  Yeah.  Not that you needed us to, but we were.  And Bill Kaye's right.  Hey, Opa, cool off champ, maybe you should wait for the audio.  We will, we will.  We will not attack him.  We'll wait.  But if this is true, it's, I'm going to say it, it's kind of surprising, because I really thought he would do differently than he is in this case.  And after they put us in warnings at Cleveland, because of whatever contract reasons he went across the street, we didn't say fuck him and he should drop, we didn't attack him at all. 
[02:18:00]  We didn't say one word.  There's plenty of people there.  You can be in the same market and not have to resort to that.  You know, that is the radio game.  It's the old, you're competing against this show or this guy, so you have to get on and trash him.  That's not necessarily true.  I mean, come on.  All right, fellas, punch it out.  Thanks for the heads up.  We'll, we'll see what that's all about. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, we'll wait.  But Maxwell, he's an unfunny scumbag.  Tim in Rochester, what's up?  Hey, I was just listening.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm trashing you guys.  Hold on.  They trash in CBS.  Okay.  Saying that they were fucking you guys on your contract, too, and that he didn't want  to work for them anymore, and he can't understand why you would have either.  He wasn't trashing you guys.  He was trashing CBS.  What do you got, Sam?  Well, we just turned it on back there and started listening, and he was saying that the stations  that you're on, you had bad ratings on all of them, and that Howard Stern needs to be 
[02:19:00]  thanked for all the stations, and that after Howard Stern left, nobody was listening to the  stations anymore.  Why another guy that has to kiss Howard's ass?  He's another guy that didn't like Howard.  Howard, oh my God.  These people are just ridiculous.  What's the tone of what he's saying, though?  Is he saying it like, yeah, Howard got the syndication deal, or is he shitting on the show?  I mean, you can hear the tone.  Yeah, no.  Well, the tone for the past five minutes that I've been listening is that this show underperformed.  That's not true.  That is so not true. 
[02:19:30]  The problem we're having is that we're competing against ourselves with satellite radio, and  anyone that's in the business and knows this more than some dopey message board poster knows  that's the problem we are having.  And not even a problem, the new regime that came in to CBS was for letting the stations choose  their local talent. 
[02:20:00]  We were put in by a guy that, when he was in charge, he decided that syndicated programming  was the way he wanted to go.  So he syndicated us all over.  Now, when Dan Mason came in, he decided that letting the stations get local talent and putting  them in there was the way to go.  Right.  So that's what happened.  And regular radio likes to downplay satellite radio in general and downplay our satellite  radio show.  They don't want to even acknowledge it exists. 
[02:20:30]  As we come over to XM every day and the phones are just lit with people that are listening  to just the XM portion of the show.  Now, according to Eric Logan, we're talking to over a million people on XM alone.  That will affect your regular radio ratings.  I'm not trying to make an excuse.  And I also know behind the scenes, probably shouldn't be playing this card, but CBS Radio  would really like our satellite radio deal to go away because they know that would greatly  increase our success on their radio stations. 
[02:21:00]  They know that for a fact.  Yeah.  Because they do research and marketing and all that.  But they know also that's going to be a tough thing to do because, you know, we're doing  both right now.  I hope we don't leave XM.  I love doing satellite, man.  It's fun to have the combination, but I love satellite, man.  It's fucking, it's just, you can just talk.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah, absolutely.  But to not acknowledge that that's one of the things that hurts us is, is kind of crazy.  It's ridiculous.  What do you got, Iraq?  He was just saying about how he was telling CBS when Howard left, dividing the network 
[02:21:30]  up into three regions wasn't going to work.  And then when he lost his station.  He didn't tell anyone that.  No one listens to what Rover has to say.  No offense.  He's a radio morning show.  And they thought he might be good enough for a few more markets.  When his portion kind of shrunk up, Adam isn't doing too well.  We aren't doing too well.  Adam actually is doing pretty well now.  I mean, you know, fair is fair.  Yeah.  He's doing all right.  They did a whole article on him in Wall Street Journal about, is he the next Howard Stern? 
[02:22:00]  He was also stating that, you know, CBS doesn't know what they're doing or how to do radio  anymore.  And he was also disappointed.  But he would have said that if they re-signed him.  He was disappointed that.  Do you know what happened with Rover?  They offered him a lot less money because they didn't think he was worth that money for  what he has done with his show.  Disappointed at what?  Yeah, I want to hear what he was disappointed.  So he was disappointed about the fact that it should have been a one-two punch to take 
[02:22:30]  CBS radio out, that they were dropping him.  And he was disappointed to hear that you guys re-signed with CBS.  Because if you had left and his show had left, CBS would have had pretty much Adam or nothing.  And that this would have really hurt them.  Well, it doesn't sound like it's...  Again, I can't hear the tone.  Like, one minute you hear, it sounds like you're shitting on the show.  And the next one minute it sounds like he's attacking...  I mean, he's not yelling or anything.  He's just speaking, I guess, in what is his normal voice.  Well, you can shit on the show without yelling. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  No one said he's fucking De Niro at the end of Mean Streets, but I'm just...  Hold yourself, Eric.  Just you around your mouth.  Ah, whatever, man.  You know.  Where's Carolla doing well?  He is doing better in LA.  He's in San Francisco.  The company's happy with him, you know?  And the company...  And I were just discussing...  Nah, this is too inside.  Who gets this?  What am I...  Well, they don't even acknowledge XM.  No, they're starting to get their act together.  CBS radio.  Their presentation last night was really, really interesting.  When you check out some of these porthole web things they're doing, I think... 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, a lot of shit going on.  They're finally figuring out how to compete, you know, with satellite radio and everything  else.  They're kind of...  Wow.  We really should just shut up.  I was kind of impressed last night, that's all.  Until I can say cunt and fuck on Terrestrial, I'll always love Split.  I love fucking XM.  Yeah.  And I love Sirius, too, believe me.  Fucking Jimmy the Whore will walk across the street and do fucking Brewer's Show with his  asshole open.  Can't wait to fucking do Brewer's Show.  Well, we could get... 
[02:24:00]  Why don't we get Rover on the phone?  We'll talk to him.  We know the guy well.  And, you know, we...  Yeah, call him.  Fuck it.  We took the...  We decided to take, you know, the high road on the whole thing.  When we moved into his slot, we didn't say one thing about him.  Didn't say one bad thing at all.  Didn't say anything.  You know?  Just didn't say a word.  A lot of these guys know why they have Robert Eatman.  Yeah.  It's directly because of us. 
[02:24:30]  Well, if that's the truth.  Anyway, so Gary Wall.  So we saw him on the street there.  And we had a nice little talk.  Living in Nashville.  He's doing business here in New York.  He won't tell us what kind of business he's doing.  No, no, no.  I don't think he wants us to, like, blow up his spot or something.  Some kind of business.  But he's in New York.  Yeah.  Doing something.  And I go...  Because he knows we've trashed him over the years.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure he hears it all the time.  I go, so, Gary.  Right to the space.  I go, Gary, so this is awkward. 
[02:25:00]  Do you hate us?  Do you hate us?  Do you love us?  Where are we at?  And what did he say?  I'm ambivalent.  Ambivalent.  He just goes, I'm ambivalent.  All right.  I got to be honest.  I kind of missed the guy.  It's an honest answer, I guess.  He had a way of just presenting himself that I kind of miss.  Ambivalent.  Ambivalent.  I'm ambivalent.  That's funny.  As honest as could be.  All right.  He was quite the character.  Yeah.  That's a little disappointing with the Rover thing. 
[02:25:30]  If, you know, it's got that nasty tone to it and everything.  It's a little disappointing.  Let's hear it first, though.  You never know.  Sam seemed to think one thing.  E-Rock, the other.  Sam.  One listener.  Sam.  What was he saying, Sam?  Sam.  What do we got for this side of the program?  Well.  Some good dirty stuff.  Some good dirty stuff.  Where's Steve?  Yeah, here.  I like dirty stuff.  He's talking to Stunt Brain over at the other joint. 
[02:26:00]  He is.  Why?  Just, I don't know, to get on the same page.  Meeting of the minds.  Right.  Hello, Mr. Stunt Brain.  I'm Steve C.  I'm Steve C.  Executive producer.  Oh.  And that's how you become the executive producer.  Wait a minute.  You're an executive producer, too?  Oh, no.  How's this going to work out?  Well, that's good to have two different ones.  That will never conflict.  That's good.  Two different executive producers. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, because they'll both be looking out for the interest of the entire show as a whole.  And it's good to have audio on one side that you can't play on the other or that you don't play on the other.  That's perfect.  Stunt Brain was a CBS hire to keep their interest.  Sure.  No one gives a fuck about anybody else.  Not one big show.  Two separate shows.  Fuck everybody.  I like my company.  Go fuck your company.  That's good.  That's the way you do business.  That's wonderful.  And we're in the middle like the fucking children of a horrid divorce.  It's where you want to be.  It's perfect.  The two companies, yeah, they don't want to acknowledge each other.  So who suffers? 
[02:27:00]  We do.  We have to walk from one studio to another.  You don't think it'd be, you know, it was kind of fun in the beginning, but now it's just a complete hassle.  Yeah, big pain in the ass.  Like, why can't we just at nine o'clock say, see you later, do a quick break and just continue.  We have to pack up our shit every day, walk, wait, wait in line at an elevator bank in this building.  Come upstairs.  They're still like setting up.  I like it actually, dude.  Can you give us a little bit of air and stuff? 
[02:27:30]  Give us time to reset.  It was fun at first, but now it's just, it's just stupid.  Yeah.  It really is stupid.  We're the ones that have to suffer because they don't want to, because neither one wants to budge.  Well, we need them to broadcast from our facility.  No, we need them to broadcast from ours.  Yeah.  The listeners don't know the difference.  You know, I listened to the replay.  I can't even tell when we left one, you know, studio and went to the other.  The bottom line is this.  There's going to be certain things on XM that are, that are like perfect.  Like, cause you know, sometimes on morning radio, you replay things, you know, like the next morning or whatever. 
[02:28:00]  And like, you might hear someone on XM that goes, wow, that would, that would be good for CBS at the seven o'clock hour.  People didn't hear that at seven o'clock.  Let's put that on.  That's kind of why I like having one guy, unless, unless he's involved with this show too, or listening to it.  Yeah.  But you know, apparently companies are like, uh, you know, at nine o'clock, they die at nine o'clock.  They die.  But don't they walk across the street?  Yes, they do.  They sit in the cafe and drink coffee.  They don't do anything else.  Okay, good.  That's good.  That's healthy.  Oh, God, it's so fucking true. 
[02:28:30]  XM is not, not much better.  We, there hasn't, and I were talking about this last night too.  There hasn't been anything that has happened with XM in the last year because of this damn merger.  Look, I'm not saying.  No new hardware, no new marketing, no new nothing.  Except new studio.  Yeah.  They did give new studio.  And I'm not saying they're not blithering idiots.  Yeah, but they owed us that years ago.  And they had been planning that well before.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is, the fact of the matter is, yeah, the excitement factor in satellite radio is 
[02:29:00]  very important.  You need that excitement that it's something new.  The technology is cutting edge.  And the fact of the matter is, there's no new technology coming out because if a merger  goes through, they're going to need technology that can work on both platforms somehow.  I don't know.  I don't know how they're going to do this.  I'm just thinking, what a waste of time the last, what, what are they up to, like 14  months?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What a waste of time.  Because what was cool about coming to satellite in the beginning, it was new. 
[02:29:30]  It was exciting.  Yeah.  It was passion.  There were people like, all right, this is the new hardware.  They really were into what they were doing.  The press releases that, well, we're announcing this new piece of hardware.  Don't say anything yet.  You guys are flying out to Vegas.  I'm like, flying out to Vegas?  The regular radio doesn't just fly out to Vegas or do this or that.  It was really cool.  And then 14 months ago, just, you know, the big hand on the brake.  The big sweaty hand on the rusty brake handle.  Sparks flying off the wheels.  It's a step back to take a bunch of steps forward. 
[02:30:00]  Well, hopefully.  That's what you hope for.  Yeah.  But the thing is, 14 months of just being in limbo, being in complete limbo.  I'm starting to think conspiracy.  I told Anthony last night, too.  We had a lot of discussions about radio on our walk after our big corporate event we had  last night.  And I'm thinking the NAB has so much pull.  They were able to slow down the merger, allowing, this is my new conspiracy, allowing regular  radio to catch up.  Because now it's all about the internet and they're finally figuring out how to make that 
[02:30:30]  work for them.  And I think that's all it is about, that the NAB had enough power to just slow the whole  fucking thing down and go to regular radio.  Look, this thing is going through.  So we're going to buy you some time, but you got to get your shit together.  Yeah.  I'm very suspicious.  Yeah.  Get on the cutting edge of the internet technology.  Right.  Because that seems to be what CBS is doing.  Well, that's what CBS wants to do now.  They want to make shows like this internationally popular through the internet. 
[02:31:00]  You know, obviously you got the problem with the internet in the car still, but not problems  with like a website where your show could be available, then you download it and listen  in your car whenever you want.  Yeah.  But, you know, but they're at least, you know, they're at least realizing that they got to  they got to figure out their, their shit.  Yeah.  Cool.  It's five to nine.  Get in the coffin.  Can we make, it went up, it's already passed on instant feedback, but it's a great suggestion. 
[02:31:30]  Now that we have another executive producer named a stunt brain that, that only cares about  the CBS portion of the show.  I think it's great.  Can we make Steve super duper executive producer?  Just so he has a different title.  Super duper executive producer, Steve C.  I think he'd like that.  Yeah.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Well, you know how I feel.  Yeah.  I like, I like, I like. 
[02:32:00]  And again, I met the guy today.  He seems like a nice dude, but I, and he may be very qualified.  I just, the, the, the, the, uh, well, bring the E-Rock in.  E-Rock has some stunt brain stories.  Yeah.  He's got stories already?  Oh yeah.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Just the pomposity of splitting it like XM is shit and doesn't matter.  Drives me crazy because we do do things over here.  And what if there's a guest, this is my bug to me.  What if there's a guest that say is on at nine o'clock or scheduled for 815 and goes, ah, 
[02:32:30]  God damn it, I got something else to do.  Hey, can he come in at 915?  Like, even though that's more Roland's gig, it's almost like anything that would have to  bleed into this side, which would be beneficial for the show overall, won't happen.  And that drives me nuts.  And it doesn't have to be that way because you care about XM does not, it's not mutually  exclusive.  I'm, I'm in full agreement.  I think if I care about CBS too, these two companies really got together and said, look,  this is, you know, let's just work on the Opie and Anthony show as a whole.  They would both benefit, but they don't understand that concept for some reason.  They just don't understand it. 
[02:33:00]  I haven't noticed XM being as, as exclusionary to be honest with you.  I have, but again, they run the whole show.  So maybe it's different.  Maybe I'd feel the same way if I ran, if I was in CBS.  Well, CBS is very, uh, you know, open about how they are with the, the situation we're  in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dead.  We hate him and you only work for three hours.  Iraq, what do you know on Stunt Brain?  You were telling me a good story that we got to bring up tomorrow on the show.  But, um, in the early nineties, I, I saw, I saw Stunt Brain, um, at an event with, uh, 
[02:33:30]  Gordon Elliott, who used to do Good Day New York.  Sure.  With the English accent.  Yeah.  Um, him and Gordon were at a supermarket doing turkey bowling live on the radio and on Good  Day New York.  Turkey bowling.  Yeah.  That's where you take the frozen turkey and you have bowling pins and, and you slide  it across the floor.  They, they had canned goods set up at the end of a, of an aisle. 
[02:34:00]  Canned goods.  And was this for a, um, uh, giveaway for like the poor?  I don't remember what.  Turkey bowling for the poor?  I don't remember what it was for, but I, during the CBS show, it dawned on me that I,  this, I remembered seeing this.  Um, but they had, uh, a whole box of turkeys that they were, they were just throwing out  and then inviting people in off the street to come in and also bowl in the supermarket.  Of course.  Um, you know, who knows?  Look, early nineties, it might be, you know, again, you do something 15 years ago. 
[02:34:30]  No, no, no.  But you do something X amount of years ago.  You know?  Well, yeah, I think we did bra, uh, the bra bombing like 12 years ago.  So.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So maybe that's not that big of a deal.  People move on.  And yeah, he seemed nice enough.  So, uh, the police have a major announcement at times square today with mayor Bloomberg at  one Keith Williamson from Delaware.  What's that about?  Is that real?  What is that?  What would be the major announcement at times square?  Leave the city tomorrow? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  They're, they're, they're closing the city down.  Well, Reverend Al's doing his, uh, praying tomorrow and he's, and, uh, and he's hinting that  a lot of people are going to get arrested.  So maybe, uh, Bloomberg is like, you know what?  Maybe there'll be some violence.  Yeah.  Can I say those three faces out there say it all?  Why?  Why?  They're laughing now.  I've seen happier people in that coma documentary.  Don't blame them.  Don't start looking at the audience out there and crying, Jimmy.  I can't help it.  Just say something.  They look happy.  They look fun. 
[02:35:30]  They just look bad.  We, we just need this merger to go through.  Do we have anything planned for today?  Let's, let's fucking get something planned here.  Well, we, I, I, I, I, I, oh, we don't.  Yes.  Super duper executive producer.  Super duper executive per duper.  Is meeting with Stunt Brain right now.  That's cool.  Super duper.  Loves it in the pooper.  Rhymed.  Steve, Steve goes, uh, after the CBS show, I'm going to, I'm going to leg behind and,  uh, and talk to Stunt Brain.  I'm like, okay, you do that.  How about you talk to Stunt Brain at 11?  Yeah.  Well, no, but you know, he's already been brainwashed that the CBS is more important. 
[02:36:00]  Of course.  The guys, they went home.  It's nine o'clock.  Don't you know?  They die at nine o'clock.  They go to bed and they wake up and come here.  That's why, that's why they're, that's why I'm here.  I could spend time with you because the XM portion of the show is not important when  you're the executive producer of the O.P.  Anthony show.  I just want to kill myself.  Jimmy, I used to be like you, but now I just, I, some, some, some, some,  somewhere along the line, along the, along the way, I, I just drank the Kool-Aid. 
[02:36:30]  I just said, you know what?  I can't, I'm going to have an aneurysm if I, I, I continue to be a pissed off at all  the crap that happens.  I'm not even angry.  It's a little laughable to me.  I don't get it.  It is laughable.  I don't get it.  And that's how you executive produce.  Yes.  What's what you get, Jimmy?  Let's get into this for another second.  I don't get the thinking.  That's, well, I don't get, I don't, I'll, I'll start.  I don't get that Steve C decided it was more important to go talk to Stunt Brain than continue  producing the show.  Yeah, stupid thing.  What happened? 
[02:37:00]  I had a Steve Clip and it just says hot key, not, yeah, well, hot key, not assigned.  I lost my Steve Clip.  Yeah.  People don't, Bill Kay, who's a regular, doesn't know who Stunt Brain is.  He's the latest producer that has been hired for the show.  For CBS.  I've lost track.  Yeah.  For the first three hours, for the first 60% of the show, we have one guy.  And for the second, the 40% of the show, we have Steve.  But Steve's supposed to be the other side, too.  Oh, is he? 
[02:37:30]  So Steve's like 100%.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  Steve's still 100%.  I didn't know that.  In name or title only?  But now he has to compete against Stunt Brain now.  Okay, I don't know.  No one's told me, because nobody over there would ever tell me anything.  So I have no idea what's going to hate my guts.  I don't know that.  I don't know what's going on.  Oh, God.  They don't hate your guts.  They do.  It's okay.  I don't take it personally.  They don't hate your guts.  The people that I think didn't like you or whatever are long gone.  I think they're gone.  But then some of those guys that didn't like you then decided that they didn't like me 
[02:38:00]  now, but they now like you.  It's just ridiculous, this whole business.  It's just silly.  This makes me laugh now.  It's just silly.  Cockmeat.  Nothing but cockmeat.  That's our executive producer.  Can we get Steve on the phone?  I want to see how his Stunt Brain meeting's going.  Well, no, I'm just explaining to him that while he's trying to say something, I'll be scrolling  and going, okay, let me check.  What could they possibly be discussing right now?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't want to interrupt. 
[02:38:30]  Please interrupt him.  Please get him on the phone immediately.  Interrupt him.  Call him on the hotline so we can get him right on.  Hello?  Yeah, no, I'm coming soon.  Travis, what's going on?  Well, I'm just trying my damnedest to call Steve, but he hung up on me the first time  and now he's not answering his phone.  How about we tell, oh, okay, that would actually help the show.  Why would he do it?  Yeah.  Right.  At the very least, he's got to think, all right, they're calling me.  They're trying to make good radio.  Get him on the fucking phone.  I'm doing my best. 
[02:39:00]  That's how you executive produce.  I love the shirt, by the way, Travis.  It's Jimmy's shirt day.  You know, shirts that Jim's mom gave Jim that Jim decided not to wear.  Oh, I wore it.  The staff is wearing today.  They're wearing them proudly.  I wore it.  We've got to get a group photo of the guys in your shirts today.  We should have had them take those shirts off at 9 o'clock.  Leave those shirts here.  Where's Steve?  You know what, Jimmy?  You nailed it, though. 
[02:39:30]  In their minds, the show just ends at 9 o'clock.  It completely ends at 9.  They don't even care what we do here.  What's up, Sam?  But it drives me nuts.  We didn't even get suspended over there when we screwed up over here.  Which I do love them for that.  I do love the fact they stuck with us during that shit.  Or you guys.  No, I just think it's because they didn't care.  Like, they just don't care that we, you know, that we were on the air.  Yeah.  Because they don't acknowledge it.  Like you said, 9 o'clock, we're dead, so it doesn't matter what we do here. 
[02:40:00]  We could kill someone in here and still have a show over there.  I just called Steve on my cell phone, and he did pick up,  but he said he's outside walking with Stunt Brain,  so he won't come on the air, but he'll be here in a little while.  Why can't he talk outside on the air?  And he's walking over with Stunt Brain?  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, I can't wait.  When are they going to be here?  We've got to get them on the air immediately.  You said he's walking now, so.  Well, no, we were just discussing why a man of my size wears a medium shirt. 
[02:40:30]  Dude, the beauty of this.  We have probably 15 people that now work for us.  At 940, the main guy is still not over here for the XM Porsche for the show.  Because he had to talk to Stunt Brain.  It's going to be funny when Steve comes up.  Stunt Brain.  And Stunt Brain can't walk in the building.  It's like a vampire trying to enter a church.  He'll keep trying to walk in and keep bouncing backwards.  You're not allowed in here.  I can't.  What's happening in that?  He won't even know the building's here.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It goes 113, 109.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  Should we take a break?  I have to tinkle big time, GH.  Okay.  Jimmy, I...  But no, you have some go-to stuff.  I can't help myself.  But I see Jimmy's annoyed.  I try to break his funds.  Because it's so much fun for me.  Because I lived it for so long, and I can't be bothered anymore.  I just can't.  And God bless that you are, Jimmy, because we do need someone that's going to fight the  good fight.  But I honestly...  It just makes me laugh how ridiculous it is.  The companies work together.  Like, I want the companies to work together. 
[02:41:30]  I'm happy to be doing both.  I really am.  You talk to a lot more people on regular...  See, what they don't understand either is, like, let's say CBS has guests and maybe ideas  that we can't do on CBS, but they help us here on XM.  Now, like you said earlier, you don't think now the next CBS portion of the show, we're  not going to discuss what happened on XM.  Like, we just did...  We did a pretty good first break today just talking about our dumb corporate event.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So, some of that other stuff that happens over here that CBS helped us with, we would  bring over there and make good radio. 
[02:42:00]  Well, let's say we...  But they don't understand that concept.  No.  It's a five-hour show.  And I would like to have it viewed as a five-hour show.  Not two separate ones.  Well, except for the 20-minute walk and the times we do leave a little early.  But yeah, in general, it's a five-hour show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those times.  Yeah, but with commercials, we're not talking then either.  So, I mean, it's...  You know what I mean?  It's like on CBS, the commercials, you don't talk.  And here, we're walking and leave together.  You know what's funny, too?  Like, a lot of these listeners that, you know, bitch and complain because we leave early  or we do this or that, they don't even understand. 
[02:42:30]  And this is what makes me laugh, and it really does.  We have no bosses at XM officially.  We don't.  We could probably blow off the XM portion of the show.  And I'm not even kidding.  No, I'm not even kidding.  We could probably go two weeks before someone would even notice and go, guys, what's up?  You haven't done an XM show in a while.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, I'm sorry.  We're just going through some stuff.  We'll do one tomorrow.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  We're showing extreme discipline that we even show up here anymore. 
[02:43:00]  Extreme discipline.  Dude, am I wrong?  No, you're not.  I can't get Logan on the phone for the life of me anymore.  I want the merger to go through.  I didn't at first.  I was nervous about it, but I wanted to have it.  In the end, I think it's a great thing.  I really do.  Absolutely a great thing.  What I'm frustrated about is the fact that it's taken so goddamn long, and I just imagine  all the great things that could have been accomplished instead of just stopping business  and waiting for the merger to go through.  I'm host of the HBO thing. 
[02:43:30]  It's like younger comics, kind of, and then one headliner on each show.  Headliner's only doing like 8, 10 minutes, a 30-minute show.  The fucking first comic to call me back that I called, fucking Artie Lang.  Nice.  I want the merger to go through.  I'm tired of the fucking fighting with Sirius and the bullshit.  I'm tired of it.  Fucking, my friends work there.  Their friends work here.  It's fucking, you think I don't want to hang out with Jim Brewer or Corey Alley?  I know, yeah.  Fucking have Florentine on.  It drives me nuts, fart.  I got to tell you too, the other day I ran into Fred Norris at a supermarket, and it was 
[02:44:00]  like, all the years of infighting between the two shows, I look, I'm like, I think that's  Fred Norris.  I was with my girl, and all of a sudden, he looks up, he goes, hey!  And he goes, congratulations on the engagement, and congratulations on the new deal you guys  signed with CPS.  I'm like, thanks, man.  Thanks.  And I go, don't you live, and I kind of mention where he might be living, and he's  like, yeah, I'm like, all right, I'll see you around.  It was like, it couldn't have been nicer. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  I've seen him around there, too.  I think the listeners expect that, like, it doesn't all happen.  A brawl all the time.  Like, we just start strangling each other in the supermarket.  It was the same thing with the poker game.  Yeah.  With Howard.  With Howard.  Like, people expect that I was just going to...  E-Rock's got something.  All right, E-Rock.  He just called, and he won't come on the phone, but he said he'll be there in a minute.  He's almost at the building.  What is he fucking looking at?  How did he go?  I'm almost there.  How did he loop?  Down 7th Avenue, and he fucking made a right on 42nd and came back up 8th?  I don't know.  But he called to tell me, he's like, I'm not coming on the air, but I'm almost at the 
[02:45:00]  building.  Why won't he come on the air?  Because I'm not here yet.  I'm not the executive producer till I walk through the door.  And you know how we just explained how we have extreme discipline?  Steve doesn't.  He knows he can get away with this, so he does.  And God bless him, because we're all like that.  Eric knows.  Off the subject.  No, I'm not making fun of Eric, but I have to say, in that shirt, you look like a fucking  saran wrap over mashed potatoes on the place, sideways. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, come on.  He's trying.  He's trying, Jimmy.  What does Eric know, by the way?  Oh, he just knew Jim was gearing up for a smash.  Oh, okay, okay.  Off the subject.  What could it possibly have been?  If only that was a saran wrap shirt, that would have been a home run.  Yeah.  Fuck, unfortunately.  Hey, is this really Randy Spears, one of the guys from the BLI Morning Show?  Randy.  Yes.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  How are you, Randy?  Fine.  I heard you were talking about us today. 
[02:46:00]  That's not a real voice.  Yes, it is.  Opie and Anthony.  Why did you say that?  Last time you said that, too.  We didn't believe that we were actually talking about, talking with you last time.  Yeah, that was me.  Are you guys still on the air?  Yeah.  Is this Fezzy?  I don't know if this is the real Randy Spears.  What did you say, Matt?  Do I got to come down there and show myself?  So how was the big gas giveaway?  Yeah, $1.06 for gas.  Wow.  That was a success. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Did you come down and get some gas for $1.06?  Wait, if you're still doing your morning show out there on Long Island, play a sweeper  or something from BLI.  Yeah.  Can I play one, Drew?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  It really is him.  Jesus.  Why don't you do your own fucking show?  Okay.  Wait.  Here it is.  1-6.1 BLI.  BLI in the morning.  All right.  You doing all right?  All right.  Wow.  Okay. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  We just wanted to check in with you.  Hold on.  Randy Spears, we talked a lot about you because you got suspended for talking bad about Mastic,  just to bring everyone up to speed.  Yeah.  And then we talked about you guys this morning because you're doing $1.06 gas, which is,  you guys got to admit, that's a very, very hacky radio bit.  Yeah.  Oh, dear, Anthony, that wasn't hacky.  I ran out of gas the week before.  Randy, we get it. 
[02:47:30]  You're over-the-top gay guy.  He's gay?  And what are you, straight?  Hell, yeah.  I'll take it for my dick.  Oh.  Oh.  A little blue there.  A little blue.  A little saucy.  A little saucy.  A little saucy there, Randy.  A little saucy little thing.  Oh, cool.  Steve, I can stuff right here.  I'll smell you.  Of course.  All right.  Thank you, Randy.  Bye, boys.  Randy Spears.  Bye-bye, Randy.  I guess that's really him.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Fez is going to be jealous, man.  Hey, Steve.  Hi, boys.  Hi, I'm the executive producer now.  So how come the boss didn't come up?  Hold on.  We got you.  Wait, what?  Why didn't you both come up?  Is Stunt Brain here?  No.  No, I wouldn't.  Let's go to the shows.  How come he didn't come up and say hello?  Did you guys want him to come up?  Nobody told me this.  Wait, because you wouldn't answer the phone.  We were trying to get you on the phone.  I was talking to him.  So what?  What's more important?  On the air, we're talking to him.  Actually, right now, talking to him is very important.  Why is it very important, Steve?  Because I've got to find out exactly what his role is in this whole thing,  and he doesn't even know.  The alpha male who fucking puts on the glasses and walks away. 
[02:48:30]  Why did he come up and say hello?  Yeah.  Did you?  I didn't know you.  No, unless you want to acknowledge that there's another portion of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a whole fucking thing.  It's a clusterfuck.  The whole thing is a clusterfuck.  Yeah, no, he does.  He does, actually, and I'm sure he would have.  And I actually would have liked the response to one of my text messages  when I asked somebody, what's going on?  What's the problem?  Well, Travis called you, and he said you hung up on him.  He wouldn't come on the air.  No, I said you wouldn't come on the air.  Excuse me!  I didn't hang up on anybody.  Why wouldn't you talk to Stunt Brain after the Opie and Anthony show officially ends, 
[02:49:00]  not when CBS thinks the show ends?  Wait a minute.  That's not what you said in your email last night when I told you I was doing it.  I said, yeah, whatever.  I did say whatever.  That is a good point.  Yeah, thank you.  But, Steve, one of the listeners, I can't give him credit because I don't know which  feedback it was anymore, but you're now the super-duper executive producer.  Super-duper executive producer. 
[02:49:30]  It's a brand new title.  Because I hear they're giving him an executive producer title.  Yeah, he's got an executive producer title now.  Oh, good.  So now we're making you the super-duper executive producer.  How can I get that on a business card?  At least Jimmy's happy with the situation.  Yeah, Jimmy has no problem with it.  Jimmy seems very frustrated right now.  No, no, that's happiness.  It's not with you, but in general.  It's a fucking clusterfuck.  Drives me nuts.  And that's how you executive producer.  I have a feeling that they brought him, or one of the reasons they brought him on. 
[02:50:00]  No, I don't, not even knocking him.  I only met him once, and I liked him.  He's a nice guy.  He's a nice guy.  He's got a lot of time in this business.  Yeah, I'm not saying he's not qualified, but he's not the right guy.  Why are you thinking they brought him on?  No accountability, because we all work for XM.  So they can tell us to do something, but...  Yeah, but we've been pretty good.  No, I think we've been...  But with him, because he works for them.  Right.  I have a feeling that's one of the reasons.  But who is...  No one's told CBS to go fuck them.  We listen to them.  Of course we don't.  We're pitch-sloppers.  We listen.  You guys listen. 
[02:50:30]  It's our job.  Yeah.  So what did you guys discuss?  I asked him if he got a good idea of what goes on around here.  He was asking me if we did certain things, if we cut up the audio before the show, if  you guys listened to the audio clips before you played them, or you just relied on the  rest of the crew to tell you what the certain stories were about.  He's already questioning the rest of the crew?  Yeah, we don't listen to most of those clips ahead of time.  These guys have honed their skills. 
[02:51:00]  And it means less time that we have to worry and put in.  We talked about a few ways to streamline turkey bowling.  Ooh, yes.  Turkey bowling.  Eric made sure that he let Stunt Brain know that turkey bowling was in his past.  Oh, really?  We have audio of that.  Let's try YouTube.  Maybe you can find Gordon Elliott turkey bowling.  You know what the Stunt Brain means?  Did we ever explain where Stunt Brain came from? 
[02:51:30]  Please tell me it was from Dallas in 1962.  That's the right year.  See, Anthony's a sick fuck, too, because the only reason he's going to explain this is to  get under Jimmy's skin.  You have joined me.  I don't know if it'll bother me.  It probably won't.  I don't know.  I don't think it will, Jimmy.  See, he's got this whole thing that he is the Stunt Brain.  Now, when do you call in the Stunt Man?  When the talent, the actor, is doing something and then has to do something like above and 
[02:52:00]  beyond.  Sure.  Now, you pull the actor and put in the Stunt Man.  Right.  He considers himself like when we're doing our show and we need something, you know,  that we can't really come up with in our brains, he acts like the Stunt Brain.  The Stunt Brain can jump in at a moment's notice and take over and, you know, just kind of  get the ideas and, you know, he's like...  The listeners are shaking their heads.  It's the Stunt Brain.  I don't believe you. 
[02:52:30]  It couldn't be that.  And, Jimmy, it's copywritten and he does have a hat that I guess he wasn't brave enough  to wear today that says Stunt Brain.  Stunt Brain and his cards say Stunt Brain and he's got StuntBrain.com, I believe.  Yeah.  And he's like building a whole thing.  Thank you.  Why would you protect something?  Again, he's got a whole thing with Stunt Brain.  He's protecting something that nobody would steal.  Who would take Stunt Brain? 
[02:53:00]  What would you use it for?  It's got to be...  It means something else.  No, it's...  No, I'd like to say it does.  The explanation you just gave me.  Yeah.  It made my stomach hurt.  I don't believe it.  I love telling Jimmy things like that.  I think he also likes to be called Coach Mike.  Coach Mike.  Really?  When he's riding around the school in his van?  Who calls him Coach Mike?  I don't know if he likes to be called Coach Mike.  I think at one point, Frankie Blue used to call him Coach Mike. 
[02:53:30]  You mean the guy that was drunk on the air, Frankie Blue?  Yeah.  Yeah, that one.  Wow.  Dan is laughing at Stunt Brain's website.  Yes, Dan.  Well, no.  It is his official website.  No, I'm just getting into it right now.  Let's see what the photos have.  All right.  Why didn't Stunt Brain come up today?  He still has paper.  He...  Come up to watch.  Why would he come up here?  Doesn't make sense.  That's what I say.  Why don't you walk into thin air?  Doesn't make sense.  Come up to where?  Where are they?  Playing the piano in the Steinway building? 
[02:54:00]  I don't know where they are.  I don't know where they are.  That's a good take on things, Jimmy.  That's for sure.  But it's just, you know...  And then, like, then the two companies won't even work with us, so we have to leave there  to come here because they don't want to acknowledge each other.  And then after we're done here, we have to go back there for meetings.  Like, they can't even bring their people over here to meet, so we don't have to walk  now back to where we just were and wait on another elevator bank, go upstairs, to meet 
[02:54:30]  in a conference room.  Sorry, just looking for a USB port.  What are you doing?  Oh, your iPhone?  My phone is dead.  It's totally dead.  Yeah, and you can't survive without your iPhone.  No!  I can't.  Can I...  Sam, make sure those USB ports are in the box.  Can I tinkle?  I don't know where USB is.  Why, Jimmy?  I have to pee.  He's looking for a fucking USB port.  He's walking in the room.  I gotta piss.  You're enjoying all of it with a cold egg sandwich in front of you wrapped in tinfoil. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, we were gonna take a break, that's right.  All right, we'll take a break.  And we're gonna do some radio after that.  Yes.  Right?  That's right.  We start right at the fucking crack of 958.  Now that Steve has decided to join us.  Yes.  Exactly.  Footer, what's up, Footer?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Y'all, I'm listening to Anthony describe to Jimmy about this fucking where he came up with  his name.  Yeah.  I legitimately am getting physically ill.  I'm shaking.  I'm fucking shaking in my car. 
[02:55:30]  I don't even know this guy.  I want to strangle him.  I was more comfortable when, like, when he was describing Hillary's fucking stay in the  kitchen speech.  It was easier to listen to.  I'm gonna talk to Stuntbrand.  I guarantee you that that's not what I mean.  It's a joke.  Because he seems like a good dude.  He came over and introduced himself, and I liked him.  I just don't believe that that's the truth.  And he does not have a hat that says Stuntbrain.  Well, why don't we get him on the phone?  Yeah.  Can we call him up and get him on?  Why?  It'd be like Stuntbrain. 
[02:56:00]  Why don't you just call no one?  Why would he want to talk to us?  I like to make him physically ill.  He's just gonna think he's talking to us at home.  That's all.  Of course he is.  9 o'clock?  How are you, boys?  What are you doing?  Kicking your feet up at home?  XM?  What's that?  A shirt size?  Jimmy, you're 100% right, but, you know.  This is under the clips I like section.  No, it's not.  What is this?  That is the thing me and Than have goofed on for months. 
[02:56:30]  The skateboarding dog.  That's my boy Tillman.  Who's Tillman?  Tillman's the skateboarding dog.  The skateboarding dog.  Look at him chew it.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  Who's size is this?  No, he's crazy.  That's Stuntbrain.  This is his size?  And he lights the fucking bulldog on the skateboard?  Yes.  It's adorable, though.  Look.  It's not adorable.  He's doing it all himself.  I don't want to see it unless it's from Michael Vick's house.  Then I want to see dog footage.  Look, it's adorable.  Look, Jimmy.  He pushes himself and everything.  He's skateboarding.  No fucking deal.  He gets on it.  Look, he pushes the skateboard, jumps on, and there he goes. 
[02:57:00]  You know what else he'll do?  Lick peanut butter off your balls and asshole.  That's what I want to see him doing.  Let's see Dexter do this fucking thing.  Yeah, really.  Dexter is shit.  I mean, of course he is.  Of course he is.  But just because Dexter is fucking pointy-eared, bat-eared shit doesn't mean that this is fucking  entertaining.  What other clips are there under clips I like?  I don't know.  There better be a...  Brian Collins from Jersey.  Horse gag.  The only one.  Horse gag.  That's the only clip under clips I like?  Take off that S.  It's clip I like.  Yeah, what the fuck? 
[02:57:30]  How about clips I like?  That's something I could get into.  The fucking...  He'll fit in perfect with his show if he only has one clip in the clip section.  Because...  Yeah.  Thank you.  Stuntbrain.com has clips.  I like the amazing...  Oh, he's talking to Sharpton.  I like that.  What?  Go down a little bit.  Let's see what he said to Sharpton.  What?  Well, that's 2007.  That's what he...  A few samples of some of the improvised voice work that I've done. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, he does impressions?  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Let's hear it.  Now I might be screwed out of a job.  Hold on.  Why would we have Stuntbrain audio for the first day he's working with us?  That would be crazy.  Yeah, and who would want that?  Yeah, who would want to do that on XM?  Get that stat.  Yeah, get his audio.  Let's go.  Let's fry this fucker.  He's doing really good now.  Is that what he did?  Yeah, I don't...  I think it's just an audio file.  Can we play it?  Play it, my love. 
[02:58:30]  Once you notice one...  ...president's birthday.  How old is the president, Rochelle?  He is 52 years old today.  And the president?  52 years old.  Hmm.  Oh, my girlfriend is friends with the housekeeper of Martha's Vineyard, the house where he stays.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  The presidential vacation house?  Right.  He's got four housekeepers.  He's got four housekeepers that take care of him.  And, of course, a load full of security.  But one of the housekeepers, her name is Ruth Goldway, and a good friend of my girlfriend's.  You're kidding.  Call her up.  You want me to call her?  Yeah, come on.  Oh, come on.  All right, hold on. 
[02:59:00]  Come on, you're crazy.  If she says no, because all the wire, it's all tapped.  Uh-huh.  This is tapped.  Yeah, when she says no, why you can't...  She's going to know why I'm calling, first of all.  Hold on, don't say anything.  Good morning.  Hi, Ruth?  Yes?  It's Sean, honey.  Hi, Sean.  How are you?  Good, good, good, good, good, good.  Great.  You got the man out there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Is it busy?  Yes, it is pretty busy.  Yeah, a lot of security, a lot of, I guess, secret service everywhere?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:59:30]  So how's everything going with you?  Everything's okay.  Hey, listen, you're on the radio right now.  No, I don't think so.  Well, it's...  Come on, Ruth.  Go get the president.  Come on.  I'm sorry, Sean, but I can't.  It's his birthday.  It's his birthday today.  I'm sorry, Sean.  I can't do that.  We've talked about this before.  Ruth, Ruth, I need the phone.  Would you please clear the line?  Give it to him right there.  There he is.  Let me talk to the president.  Sean, I'm sorry.  What is this?  Unlistenable.  Ruth, hang up that phone. 
[03:00:00]  I need the phone now.  Let me talk to him, Ruth.  Mr. President, it's Hollywood and Goomba.  They're a couple of DJs.  I know who they are.  Tell them thank you very much for the birthday gift.  A box of condoms.  Very funny.  Ha ha.  Could you clear the line, please?  Sean, I'm sorry, but the president wants me to clear the line.  Can I ask you gentlemen to please clear this line?  It's of national security interest.  Why?  I need to talk to my brother. 
[03:00:30]  We're playing golf this morning.  Hi, good morning, KTO.  Hello.  Yes, you're on the air.  I had an experience with a UFO.  Hold on.  Don't go anywhere.  I'll be right with you, okay?  All right.  This guy's a nut.  Sounds like a nut.  Oh, no, this guy.  We're going to have fun with this guy.  Sounds like a nut.  It's with a bottle of Johnny Walker.  Hi, good morning.  You're on the air.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  Yes.  That was the spoon feed the audience. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  You're going to hear a nut.  This guy's going to be great.  I love this guy already.  You there?  Nine years ago off Montauk, I'm in a shark fishing tournament.  It's four o'clock in the morning, and we're about a mile off Montauk Point, and a bright  light comes out of nowhere.  Sounds like Goomba.  I thought it was a lighthouse.  No, this is Stump Crane.  Next thing I know, I'm getting sucked up off the boat.  Stump Crane.  Stump Crane's playing crazy quality.  I got three hours. 
[03:01:30]  And he was also cooking.  Stump Crane, John.  Yeah.  Stop laughing, John.  You can't expect a listener to call when you're going to laugh at him on the air.  All right.  So you're a fisherman, sir, and you're off Montauk, and you were sucked.  You were actually in the...  Do you want me to scan forward a little bit?  How?  No.  I missed the finality?  Yeah.  That's exactly it.  Yes.  He does a Hank Hill.  I'm going to try to find that.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just scrolling here, so I don't know.  Scroll, scroll.  It's my job.  And can I say this?  And you're calling from where? 
[03:02:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  Goomba, Johnny, I have to say this.  You wrote a book, and I fucking love it.  What was it about?  So you want to be in the mafia.  Something like that.  It's about mafia families.  You're like, yeah, it's going to be hokey.  It's funny, and it's really interesting about the mafia.  It's fucking great.  He's crazy to write about that.  He's using real names.  It's insane.  But he goofs on it, too.  But he also...  Then there's stuff where he just really talks about the mob.  Right.  Fucking...  I can't stop reading this.  Oh, that's great.  Goddamn book.  I'm really happy for it.  I'm going to have to check that out.  Yeah, it's great. 
[03:02:30]  Proving your point, Jimmy.  I got an email from Chris Oliveira, who we love.  We do love this guy.  Yeah.  Of course, he waited to email me because he assumes, like Jimmy was saying all morning,  that the show is now officially over, so I have time to read my email.  Sure, 9 o'clock.  Yeah, yeah.  Just email you.  He said this at 9.30, so it's like, okay, well, I'll give the boys a half hour after the  show to kind of wind down.  Wind down, and then I'll...  And I'll email him.  He writes, ONA, thanks again for taking time out last night to join us for the debut of 
[03:03:00]  the CBS Radio Digital Network.  We all appreciate it greatly.  Hopefully, just as important, it gave us a chance to showcase you both to an elite group  of advertisers and buyers and drive home the fact that CBS is thrilled to be continuing  in the ONA business.  Hope you guys enjoy it as well.  Chris, give me a call.  Yeah, we'll give him a little time to wind down from the show.  Show's over.  I didn't recommend Baby Mama. 
[03:03:30]  What?  Joe in Vegas.  Opie, I just would like some acknowledgement today.  I just want to say fuck you for the movie recommendation, Baby Mama.  Faggot.  I had a choice between Iron Man and that piece of shit.  I'd tell my girl, oh, Opie said it was good.  What did you say that day?  I said I went and I said it's one of those, I think I said pretty much it was one of those  movies, no harm really.  You said best movie of the year.  No.  Oh, my God.  Something like that.  Best movie of the year.  Best movie of the year.  Oscar worthy.  You said I laughed, I cried, it had everything. 
[03:04:00]  I put a tampon in.  That's right.  I laughed, I cried, I shat in the mouth of an invalid.  And Joe, come on.  The hype from Iron Man, you ignored all that because of a throwaway comment I said about  Baby Mama.  Get your own life.  I said it was funny, but it's just there.  You know, I went with my chick.  Yeah, bathroom.  Yeah, let's do that.  Yeah, take a little break.  Okay. 
[03:04:30]  Go.  Let's go to break, I guess.  Break.  Thank you for coming to the retarded fast food service industry.  Please watch this training video to help acclimate you with your new position.  Now, you got to do your work and you got to do it good.  You should have been left in the dumpster behind grandparents.  When you're done with work, you can go home, even though you're lacking a chromosome.  And you got to work fast and you got to work hard because after all, you're just a big  tongue, green tongue, green tongue, black in the, black in the, black in the, black in  the chromosome. 
[03:05:00]  Welcome to the team.  Opie and Anthony continuing.  We got Michael Madsen checking in today.  Yes.  God, we love this effing guy.  This fucking guy.  Michael, what's up, buddy?  Fuck you.  There he is.  How are you, sir?  We woke you up.  Aren't you in LA?  Yeah, I'm in LA for sure.  Can't you tell?  Yeah.  You had to get up just to do this, this war shit, huh? 
[03:05:30]  No, I actually had to get up to clean up dog shit.  Well.  And they're both sitting here staring at me like they didn't do it.  What kind of dogs you got?  I got a German Shepherd and a kind of a Rottweiler, Doberman mix that I brought back from Romania.  Yeah, see, you got real dogs.  We got a guy on staff, he has a French Bulldog.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Same guy.  I like the English Bulldogs.  They're cool.  They are.  The French ones are.  This one isn't even, it's like a little faggy dog. 
[03:06:00]  They got funny looking heads.  They look like they're shrunken, they look like some kind of creatures from a movie or something.  Yeah, big stupid ears.  Like hobbits.  Yeah, they had to try to make the Bulldog look cute.  Yeah, let's take a bulldog and shrink it.  Yeah, great idea.  Yeah, it's a damn thing.  Sounds like it has asthma.  Who said it that it sounds like it has sleep apnea while it's awake?  Yeah.  Or something like that?  That was a great line.  They're pretty frisky, those little ones.  No. 
[03:06:30]  Hey, dude, we've been talking about you ever since your appearance on our show.  We wish you lived in New York so we could have you on more often.  Listen, if I did, I'd come up and hang with you guys every day.  That'd be, you guys got a great job talking on the radio.  I had a lot of fun that day.  That was a blast.  That was a terrible spot for me, too.  Thanks for having me back.  I figured it was either that or you'd never speak to me again.  No, hell no.  Like you said, you know, I won't be in New York anytime soon.  I hate, I fucking hate New York.  Well, you know, it was a fun holiday for me. 
[03:07:00]  You ever get rid of that car?  You know what, man?  I never, I didn't get as much action on that thing as I thought I would.  Really?  I just, I took it off.  I'm going to give it to the Hollywood Museum.  They're going to rent it from me for a while, I guess.  Oh, that's cool.  That works.  You know, I figured it would go real fast and I'd get a lot of money for it, but nobody  really, maybe I put it in the wrong, I don't know, maybe I didn't advertise it right,  I don't know.  I don't remember, but do you have the ear from Reservoir Dogs, the fake ear? 
[03:07:30]  No, no, I don't have it.  I think Quentin does.  See, that would be something that would sell on eBay.  He has the razor.  The razor.  Oh, he's got the razor, huh?  Yeah, he has the razor.  That's the one he gave to Uma Thurman.  She used that razor and killed Bill when she was inside the box.  Oh, no shit.  The same one.  No shit.  There you go.  Yeah.  I got to say, your dance at that moment was the highlight of the film for me.  Well, I obviously can't dance.  I thought you were terrific.  Just that little slow shuffle. 
[03:08:00]  I didn't know what the hell to do because we never rehearsed it, and so when we finally  shot it, I just really didn't know what to do.  It just came on me in a moment.  Oh, you just kind of decided to dance a little bit before you sliced his ear off?  Well, in the screenplay it said, Mr. Blonde maniacally moves around the manacled cop.  And so that was my screen direction, so I had to figure something out on my own.  It was maniacally, I'd say.  Absolutely.  What could be more maniacal than bad dancing? 
[03:08:30]  What could be more irritating than somebody who's duct taped to a chair of someone bad  dancing around you?  But you did make matters worse when you were speaking.  Add to the torture, right?  Guess what?  Listen, I'm going to cut you up, and you know what else?  I can't dance.  And it makes me angry.  But I'm going to try, and you're going to watch me, man. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, shit.  What are you working on now?  Well, the movie's Vice, and now I don't know what to think because you put all your movies  on your website and then openly trash some of them.  So I don't even know.  Do you believe in this movie?  Where are we at with this one?  No, Vice I like a lot.  Okay.  It's one of the better efforts I think I've made.  It's a really dark cop drama.  It's myself with Daryl Hannah and Michael T. Williamson, and I got to be an executive 
[03:09:30]  producer on it, so I got a lot to say about the way it was made and who's in it.  And Andre Sikula shot the picture for me.  He was the DP on Reservoir Dogs.  Oh, wow.  You know, he kind of came out of retirement to shoot it for me.  And I just, you know, for me, it's not going to be everybody's.  It's not going to be for everybody, but I put it up in the top five pictures I think I've  ever made.  Oh, my God.  That's cool. 
[03:10:00]  It's pretty tough.  You know, we didn't have a lot of money for distribution, so it's only going to be in  about 25 or 35 theaters.  It might be kind of hard for people to find where it's playing, but I'm hoping that it'll  get, it'll do good enough where it is that it'll, you know, can go out and expand to more  theaters because we didn't have a lot of money for advertisement.  So that's how that gets done.  If it does well in the 25 theaters, then they'll just expand the release.  Somebody pick it up, yeah.  If you don't have a couple million dollars for P&A nowadays, you can forget about having 
[03:10:30]  a picture released theatrically.  Where's it actually going at?  Going out in New York, L.A., Chicago?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And only in a couple theaters.  They got trailers playing in about 100 theaters, but it's only coming out in about 25 or 30  times.  Oh, okay.  They got the spots on TV.  I'm just kind of hoping it's going to be one of those things that maybe if, you know,  enough folks, you know, dig it, they'll tell each other.  You can see, it's visethemovie.com and you can see where it's playing.  There's a whole bunch of theaters.  There's actually more theaters than I thought listed, so you can go see it if you want. 
[03:11:00]  It's a good picture.  It really is.  It's different.  It's kind of mysterious and has a very strange ending.  Why don't you think it will be for everybody?  Do you think certain people are going to be turned up by the violence?  Well, you know, I mean, it's not family-oriented entertainment.  Um, it's not, uh, Iron Man.  It's, it's, uh, I mean, it's, there's a lot of bad language in it.  There's a lot of gunfire. 
[03:11:30]  And it's, uh, I mean, I think that, I mean, it's one of those films that, uh, remember when  The Bad Lieutenant came out with How You Can Tell?  Yeah.  Well, it was the kids, it's sort of like that, except without the jerk-off scene.  I hear, uh, I got distracted.  I hear, like, birds in the background or something.  Well, I'm standing outside because my, my son, uh, is, uh, well, there's several reasons  why I'm outside. 
[03:12:00]  All right.  One of them was to clean up the dog shit, like I said.  Yeah.  And, um, my family tends to argue in the morning, which means that I usually go outside.  You don't want to deal with it.  Especially if I have to go on the radio, you guys don't want to hear that in the background.  Actually, that would be kind of fun to listen to.  You'd make that interesting.  Some folks approached me to do a reality show called Meet the Madsons.  And, uh, they actually wanted to send, like, a camera crew into my house with my wife  and I and six boys, and, uh, I told them that it would be a catastrophe, but they seemed 
[03:12:30]  to think that it would be very popular.  Would you do that?  Well, I, you know, I guess it would depend on the payday, but, uh.  That sounds like a big enough thing.  I don't know if I want to bring my kids into, I don't want to put my kids in show business,  you know.  Right, right.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, you know.  Right, right.  I don't think I'd come downstairs and face cameras.  Well, you could always pick and choose.  Like, the Osbournes didn't have, uh, they had, like, Kelly and Jack, but they didn't 
[03:13:00]  have Amy, the oldest daughter, in it at all.  So, if a couple of them didn't want to be in it, they could probably be left out.  Well, I'll have to wait and see what kind of terms they come up with, but, uh, I think  I'm happy making movies right now for a while.  Hey, did you hold off on the release of this because you were afraid to, a couple weeks  ago, compete with Al Pacino's 88 Minutes?  No, I, I, I really, honestly, it just took a really long time to get independent distribution.  And it took a lot to get, uh, took a long time to get all the money in for the, the 
[03:13:30]  P&A to get the one she's done, the trailers done, and all that's just, you know, I just  got involved in the production end of things, and I had no idea how complicated it was, and  it just took a really long time to get the fucking thing out there.  You know, uh, I think the point Jimmy was making is that, uh, everyone knew that this  Al Pacino movie was dog shit.  And that it was on the shelves for a couple of years, and a movie like that got, uh, major  distribution, and a movie like Your Vice, maybe, maybe they should have, uh, you know,  uh, got that all over the place instead of 88 Minutes. 
[03:14:00]  We've just been teasing that movie, because, like, as much as you, I gotta, you gotta love  Pacino, it's just, it's just one of those ones you're doing, you're like, ugh, and it  just looks fucking god-awful.  Well, you know, a lot of, a lot of people get behind some of these big movies, and there's  a lot of studios that will spend, you know, 10 or 15 million dollars on prints and ads,  and, you know, a guy like me, I got a little independent picture, and I can't get anybody  to look at it, you know, because they automatically, you know, I mean, there's a lot of political  reasons why they don't want to get involved with getting behind a smaller film, unless, 
[03:14:30]  unless, of course, it does really well, then I'll probably be able to make a good, uh, DVD  deal, but I didn't want it to go straight to DVD and just disappear into oblivion, but  it's pretty hard, I mean, it's a very, very, very, uh, you'd be surprised, uh, independent  distribution is, is a very, very tough thing to find, getting people to put up, you know,  10 million bucks on a movie that only cost 3 million dollars to make.  When is, when is the internet gonna help, uh, the film industry, because you got a lot 
[03:15:00]  of bands that couldn't get exposure on, uh, radio stations, and then the internet really  opened up the doors for a lot of bands that would have never been played on, on, uh, radio.  I think that's probably, that's probably coming big time.  Because, like, a movie like Vice, you're saying, you know, you're proud of it, you like it,  you're saying it's one of the top five movies you ever did, but, uh, there's a good chance  a lot of people aren't gonna even know it's out there.  It's too bad that, uh, there's not a place you can go on the internet to kind of discover  some of these movies that don't get the attention.  Well, it's got a, it's got its own website, it's got a Vice website, and it's got a link to 
[03:15:30]  my site, and you can watch the trailer on the internet, and it's got information about  all the cast and everything like that.  You know, the only way that this picture's ever gonna make it is if people start talking  about it, if people like it, and people go to see it.  Yeah.  Because no matter what a studio tries to do to kill something, you know, you can't  stop the people.  Right.  And if the people come in to see the picture, you know, sooner or later they're gonna have  to accept reality that it's gonna do well. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, that's a good point.  What exactly did, you didn't actually go, what it's about, so you play a detective, and  you were respected, and you lost your wife, and it's, it's, like, kind of like a, what  is it, like a mental unraveling?  It's, uh, yeah, it kind of starts out that way, and I got Daryl Hannah to come in and  play my partner, and then Michael T is, uh, on the, you know, Michael T and I are  partners, and she's part of the team, and it's about a bunch of cops, and they betray  each other, and it's really kind of, it's really hard to figure out who's, who, who  did what, and it's a quiet kind of, you remember that movie Bullet that McQueen did? 
[03:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's, it, it has a kind of a quiet kind of a mood to it, like Bullet, it's, uh, it's  a very mysterious thing.  Cliff Martinez did the soundtrack for me, he used to be a drummer of the Chili Peppers,  and he's doing soundtracks for movies now, and he came in and put some tracks on it,  and it's just kind of, it's hard to describe, it's a very moody kind of film, and I dedicated  the picture to Chris Penn. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, cool, very cool.  Yeah.  Very cool.  It's, uh, you said the distribution is kind of political, do you mean like that people  aren't sure how it's going to make the money, or are you disliked, or have you burned bridges?  No, I think it all has to do with money, I think it has to do with decisions being made  by companies that are used to dumping, you know, huge amounts of money into big projects,  and when you have a small independent film that, uh, they weren't involved in the making  of, you know, people get, people get scared of it, and they think, oh, well, you know, 
[03:17:30]  there's things, you know, it's a great DVD movie, but we can't theatrically release this,  because they don't want to make the investment, because they know that the producer has to  get back his original money before they turn a profit, and they get afraid because they  know that you need at least 10 million to pump a picture like that, and they don't want  to wait and hope that they don't get their investment back if the movie doesn't work.  Right.  And they send people from acquisitions to look at it, and acquisitions people will sit there  and fall asleep in the screening, and, you know, how can you trust their opinion? 
[03:18:00]  You know, I tried to get it in front of, Dennis Hopper was a real, uh, he stood up for the  picture a lot for me. He took it over to Lionsgate and had them look at it and try to convince  them to distribute it, but at the end of the day, I went with a company called 41 Inc.,  and they're brand new, brand new independent distribution. If it wasn't for them, it wouldn't  be out right now.  Right on. Okay. Hey, what's your favorite scene you've ever done in movies? 
[03:18:30]  Well, it's a big biker thing for Tarantino called Hell Ride.  Right.  It's coming out in August.  Okay.  August 8th, it comes out, and I'd say that riding Harley-Davidson's up and down the freeway  out in Barstow, uh, for most of the day was probably the best day I ever had shooting a  picture.  Really?  We're getting paid to ride a motorcycle down the freeway. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, that's kind of cool.  I mean, I don't think it gets better than that. I really don't. I mean, I had a big  red chopper. It was great. I mean, it was, I kept laughing, you know, while they were  rolling, and I had to remember that my character was grim, so I had to wipe that smile off my  face, and, uh, it was kind of hard, though. I was really having fun.  My favorite scene is the, how do you say that word, Jimmy? Cuckold?  Oh, cuckold.  Oh, good cuckolding.  That's the famous, uh, cuckold scene you did, where you're banging that dude's wife 
[03:19:30]  and he's, he's tied up in the bathroom.  That was terrible.  That was hilarious.  That was pretty horrendous, yeah.  I, uh...  That was fun, though. I like Roger Donaldson. That was, he's a great director.  Yeah.  It's, uh, it's Jim Norton. I used to, uh...  I knew it. I used to open for Dice a lot, and, uh, your name came up all the time. He would  always talk about you and the days...  Is it true that he used to do a Michael Manton imitation in his act?  I don't remember. I'm sure he did a lot of the weird stuff offstage, too. 
[03:20:00]  But, yeah, I'm sure he did.  Here it is. I'm Michael Manton. Listen to me over here. I'll cut your ear off. Look, I'm  dancing.  Look, I can't dance.  I'm terrible.  Oh, he really loves you, man. He spoke very hard with you.  We had some fun. We, we, uh, hung around a couple times, and, uh, we had some laughs. He's,  uh, I haven't seen him in a long time.  Did you ever watch him beg for things from, uh, store employees? Like, if they say I'm  a fan, he'll start begging for free shit? 
[03:20:30]  No, I witnessed that one.  Yeah, it's great. I was, I used to tour with him. We were in Vegas one time in the airport,  and he actually got on his knees and started to basically, like, please just give me something  for free. Give me a cigarette lighter. He's a fun dude to hang out with.  People just give me stuff. I don't have to go that far.  Yeah. Hey, before we let you go, uh, you have any more Sam Peckinpah stories for us? 
[03:21:00]  Uh, you mean, I guess you probably remember the one I told you about the chickens, huh?  Oh, my God.  No, that's a great one.  We've replayed that a few times.  Well, I heard he liked to take a tumbler of vodka with him up on a crane for the crane shot.  Oh, yeah?  Which, no problem with that, right?  Nah, that's not good.  What's wrong with that?  Exactly.  That's easy.  He just wanted to enter his house justified.  At the end of the day, that's what we all want, right?  Yes, it is.  Now, did he clean up the crap yet, or what? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, yeah, he hosed it down.  Oh, that's it?  Did you find the guilty culprit, or no?  Hey, get it, hey.  No, they're both just still staring at me, trying to, because they know I don't know  which one of them did it.  It's funny.  They got that look on their face, like, what?  What's wrong?  We didn't do that.  You and the animals fucking know just to blame each other, you know?  There's a lot.  He'll never figure it out.  What's he going to do, taste test it?  Fuck him.  It's pretty funny.  My house is in a sane asylum. 
[03:22:00]  Inglourious Bastards, Brad W. from Kings Park is asking.  And that's Tarantino's flick.  Are you in that?  Well, according to Quentin, I'm in it, but we haven't started shooting it yet, and I  haven't seen him since Sundance.  We were up there for Hell Ride, and I haven't talked to him since then, so I'm not sure what  he's doing.  I know that he's writing, and I know I'm supposedly in it, but I think he's supposed to come to  the vice premiere.  I invited him to come tomorrow night, but I don't know if he's going to... 
[03:22:30]  He hasn't RSVP'd.  Yeah, I guess our invites got lost in the mail, but...  Yeah.  If you're in Los Angeles, you know, all you got to do is walk in the door.  That would be sweet.  It's at the Hollywood Man's Chinese Theater.  Oh, nice.  Well, it's called visethemovie.com, and, you know, we really love your work, man.  You're always good.  Even in films that you've said that you didn't like or whatever, you're always fucking just  a great actor.  You've got some clinkers out there.  Well, the website just made us laugh how he explained why he did certain movies, like 
[03:23:00]  paying the mortgage.  I will.  Oh, my God.  That would be exactly the reason.  You don't get that type of honesty from Hollywood types.  No, you're not.  Very, very funny.  It's not likely to happen in his lifetime.  Yeah.  I just quote Robert Mitchum, who said that making movies is an embarrassing and humiliating  acting is an embarrassing and humiliating profession.  Jesus.  They pay you to do nothing, and in the end, it all means nothing. 
[03:23:30]  Thanks for the encouragement, Bob.  Right on.  Thanks.  Yeah.  It comes out May 9th in select theaters, but go to visethemovie.com, and you can check  out.  There's actually more theaters than I thought.  It's obviously New York, Los Angeles, all the major.  And even in Arkansas, there's some weird places it's coming out, so it's not just major  cities, so check the site.  You're kind of downplaying it.  There's a lot of big cities on that list there, Michael.  I'm not downplaying it.  I'm just trying to ... I don't want to ring my bell too loud.  I'm just hoping that folks will pick up on the film and they'll like it, and they'll  play for a while, you know? 
[03:24:00]  It's in Canada, too, because we're hurting Canada, so ...  Hey, you got a free copy, man.  I'll get you one.  I don't really like going to movie theaters anymore.  I'll get you one.  Okay, I'll get you one for Dice Club, too.  Hey, thank you.  You're welcome.  All right, it's Michael Madsen, everyone.  You know, you're never coming back to New York, but if you do, please come by and say  hi.  You guys are good friends.  I really appreciate the time.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Take care, man.  Thanks, Michael.  Thank you.  Michael Madsen, live from L.A., cleaning up dog poo in his backyard, right? 
[03:24:30]  He's just a funny dude, man.  Yeah.  He's just a fucking naturally funny dude.  He's genuinely funny.  I don't know.  Does he know he's this funny?  Like, as funny as he is?  Is he one of those guys that knows, or he's just ...  I don't know.  I can't figure it out.  He's just himself, and it's funny.  I don't know.  I'm afraid to talk to him, because everything I said, I just ... I could picture his eyebrow  raised, and just going, shut up, you little piece of shit.  He's great.  I was hoping he'd recognize me.  No. 
[03:25:00]  This is Jim Norton, and then the pause.  The pause.  I love the pause.  Yes.  Michael, this is Jim Norton.  I didn't think so.  I didn't think so.  Jim Norton, the comedian?  That's what you expect to hear.  Jim Norton, wait, wait.  You had that show, Lucky Louie, you were on that.  Yeah.  Jim Norton, the HBO special.  I saw that.  We got to ask Jimmy about the Penn Jillette compliment.  That was nice.  That was really nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it came out of nowhere.  Yeah, it was surprising.  He came over to me, because even after we argued on the first show, I mean, I still, I like 
[03:25:30]  the guy's work, and I like what he does, so it wasn't like, oh, Penn sucks, but he  came over before we went on the air, and he's like, I really just happened to catch your  thing, and he's like, it was really smart, it was really good.  I mean, he was very ... It was nice to hear, obviously.  Jimmy, I don't know who to believe.  Do I believe Penn Jillette or Maxwell?  I don't know.  Matt Finn.  Maxwell says your HBO thing was not funny, and Penn Jillette's saying it was  brilliant, and it's right up there with, like, George Carlin and stuff.  Mean, mean.  I don't know which one to believe, but ...  Mean, mean.  He did like it. 
[03:26:00]  You're paraphrasing.  I'm happy you are, but ... Yeah, well, Maxwell ... Look, Maxwell's a fucking ... Come on.  He's just ... He's shit.  For real.  I mean, I'm not even saying ... He's just ... He's shit, Maxwell.  I can't even really do a bit with him.  It's just like, ugh, go away.  Penn was gushing over you.  Yeah, he really was.  He was giving you a good compliment.  He was very nice.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  It was nice to hear.  I'll be lying if I said that.  What did make me feel great?  Of course I did.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Guy's fucking been around for many years.  He's seen every comic.  And then how he talks about ... Yeah, he's probably so blown out and sick of seeing comics that 
[03:26:30]  he doesn't watch them on TV.  He sees Jimmy, and couldn't turn it off.  That was funny.  Oh, y'all, he didn't say this on the air, but he goes off the air.  He goes, but then again, I haven't seen a lot of comics, so you could just be really  average in a lot of ... Yeah, there's a lot of better ones that I just haven't seen.  All right, quick break.  Saddam was scared of getting AIDS while he was in what?  Jail.  Jail.  Jail.  From what?  We'll do that, Lime of the Day, and some more mopping up after this.  It's an Opie and Anthony show entertainment news minute with Hollywood actor Michael Madsen.  What was the biggest piece of shit you were involved with? 
[03:27:00]  This show.  Oh, damn.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Good morning.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  This is the Saddam story.  And some new revelations this morning into Saddam Hussein's final days in prison. 
[03:27:30]  A leading Arab newspaper reports the former Iraqi president feared catching AIDS or other  diseases while he was in captivity.  The newspaper says the comments were written down in a diary that Saddam kept while he was  in prison.  The contents of the diary were obtained and released by U.S. authorities.  Saddam was captured by U.S. soldiers in 2003 and hanged in 2006.  Hanged.  Maybe he should have been worried about that.  Exactly.  The AIDS thing.  Yeah, the AIDS thing didn't get him. 
[03:28:00]  At least the AIDS thing takes a while to finally get you.  Yeah.  A hanging is pretty instant.  You could get a little doggy.  Yeah.  A little Saddam robe for a while.  Whatever.  He was scared of AIDS.  Scared of AIDS.  What the hell are we supposed to do with that?  Delusional?  Hey, I forgot to mention that I think Bob Kelly's coming in tomorrow.  Bobby.  He was going to come in today, but he got sick in Guatemala.  Good.  No shit.  What did he get?  I'm happy to report that Bob Kelly made it back to the United States in one piece, except 
[03:28:30]  that he's shitting water or something at this point.  I hope he fucking shit the whole flight.  He's so sick, we can't even get him on the phone.  He said he got really sick in Guatemala.  Of course.  Of course he did.  He didn't get it.  I don't think he got any shots or nothing.  He just went down there cold.  Probably drank the water, the dummy.  Yeah.  Dude!  You know what?  It's so overrated, dude.  Your body adjust, dude.  Sure it does, after emptying 300 gallons of pudding.  Oh, I hope he has some kind of parasitic bacteria that has to be removed with a hammer claw. 
[03:29:00]  Like, it's in his asshole and it has to be fucking yanked out with a hammer claw along  with the soft pink skin of his ass lining.  Fucking asshole.  Dude.  I hope his first class trip was ruined.  That's great.  Your body adjusts.  The bottled water is just as bad.  Yeah, dude.  What do you think?  They bottle it in Europe and ship it?  No, dude.  They bottle it right there. 
[03:29:30]  It's the same stuff, dude.  Just drinking fucking water.  The sewage.  It's got fucking spiders in it.  Bob's a horse's patoot.  He certainly is.  Oh, is he puking too, the poor bastard?  I don't know.  We just can't even get him on the phone.  He's so sick.  But he's going to come in no matter what tomorrow.  To talk about Guatemala as he was relic hunting.  I bet his toilet.  I bet if you looked at the side of his toilet, you'd see tears coming down the side of it.  The toilet's tears.  Wow, I was just hoping that one was a clarity issue. 
[03:30:00]  Nope.  Oh, good golly.  Fucking Jimmy is killing me today.  At 9 o'clock, they just think the show disappears into thin air.  They're on from 6 to 9, and then they sleep.  But they're adding two more hours over there, I just heard.  That is good news.  Yeah, they're doing a 5 to 6 warm-up hour, and then a 9 to 10 best of over there.  Absolutely.  So they got some faith in what we're doing. 
[03:30:30]  Okay.  Does XM?  I hope so.  I think so.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  All right, one more story before we get to line of the day.  Line of the day.  This is just terrific.  Well, a disturbing scene in a Sacramento home.  Hundreds of dead cats have been found inside.  And that's only the beginning of this story.  The beginning?  That's only the beginning of this story.  And that's only the beginning of this story.  You saw Jodie Foster going into that thing.  I don't know I'm here. 
[03:31:00]  How is that the beginning of the story?  The beginning.  300 dead cats, and that's the beginning?  That's the beginning.  All right, let's see.  What happens?  Well, a disturbing scene in a Sacramento home.  Hundreds of dead cats have been found inside.  Why?  I know we do this all the time.  Same shit every different day, whatever.  But why can't they just be human beings?  Yeah.  Instead of the news voice and everything.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Wouldn't you be like...  Just a little bit glimmery.  You're not going to believe this one.  Oh, my God.  Just be human.  Right. 
[03:31:30]  And that's only the beginning of this story.  Laura Cole.  I can't get past that part.  That's...  There's a dipsy doodle in that word there, Ann.  The beginning of this story.  Laura Cole is at Eking Street near Meadowview  to explain how they were discovered this morning.  Bizarre story here, Laura.  Long story here, Ron.  But, Ron and Chris, I can still smell the stench of feces and urine  coming from the home that no one's living in now.  That's not part of the story.  What?  What you smell is not part of the story.  Get to the story, whore. 
[03:32:00]  Our previous cunt is not much better.  That no one's living in now.  Now, this all started as a 911 checkup call.  Someone called 911 from this residence, hung up the phone,  officers came out, and a 46-year-old man, Michael Parnell, answered the door.  They asked, can we come in and check around?  He said no.  They pushed their way in, saw his 84-year-old mother sitting on the couch, appeared to be  just fine.  This stupid mother just sitting there, has no clue.  No clue.  She's living in a house of horror.  Her house of shit, dead cats. 
[03:32:30]  Her fucking serial killer wannabe is killing cats in the neighborhood and freezing them  in fucking freezers.  What the hell?  And she's watching Jeopardy as all this is going on around her.  With her feet popped up in two cat slippers.  Right.  Oh, fucking best.  She's wearing a cat hat.  She doesn't even know.  My hat has a tail.  My hat has maggots in it.  I wish a Negro would punch it off.  She's got a comforter made of cat furges, no clue.  No, it's just actually a bunch of cats that piled on her when she sleeps. 
[03:33:00]  Right.  She sleeps and he throws them on like fucking hard discs of pizza.  And they land on her.  Thank you.  One side looks like a cat, the other side's just perfectly flat.  It's been laying on the floor for so long.  Coagulated blood on the side of its little fat face.  Probably just petting dead cats, just assuming they're taking a little nap.  The cat's just staring at it with those glazed over dead eyes.  And she just keeps asking over and over again,  What do you want?  What do you want?  What do you want?  Are you hungry? 
[03:33:30]  Why won't you answer me?  This one loves me.  He never leaves my lap.  Look, the skeletal one in my lap loves me.  He just sits here in dry rots.  Fucking old bag.  Hung up the phone.  Officers came out.  And a 46-year-old man, Michael Parnell, answered the door.  They asked, can we come in and check around?  He said no.  They pushed their way in, saw his 84-year-old mother sitting on the couch.  Appeared to be just fine.  But when they got inside, that smell of urine and stench just got worse. 
[03:34:00]  They found 30 cats inside the home, alive.  That's when they called animal control in.  And when animal control got out here, they found three freezers full of dead cats.  We're talking 300 dead cats right now.  And animal control says this is going to be a lengthy investigation.  Jimmy, I'm a little confused.  Do you think, I don't know, you think this 46-year-old likes cats?  I don't think this guy likes cats.  I think he loves them! 
[03:34:30]  Whoa!  He does, does he?  I say, yes.  I didn't see that coming.  No way.  I'm old Curveball Norton.  That's my new nickname.  That's all Curveball Norton.  Curveball Norton.  It's Swish.  It's Jim Norton Catch Phrase Day.  That's right.  He did Wizardry.  Wizardry.  Wizardry.  Merd.  He's in merd.  That's a Jim C.  You'll love it.  That's what these cats are.  They're implemented in a wizardry.  You just swing a dead cat over your head.  It will rain.  I just find the black humor in this. 
[03:35:00]  The fucking mother is just living among this clueless.  There was probably a time she was baking the birthday cake for her son and everything.  And everything was relatively normal in the house.  And fast forward a few decades and she's living in a house of horror.  House of horrors.  Because her stupid son hasn't gotten laid yet.  He's lost his mind.  He's a serial killer in training.  Yeah, son's a shitbag.  He puts him in the freezer.  What are you going to do with him?  What do you do after that, Jimmy?  Why wouldn't you just bury him or something? 
[03:35:30]  What is he saving him for?  When do you thaw them out?  When do you go, time to thaw out number 216.  When does that happen?  What occasion calls for thawing one of the animals out?  Yeah, why freeze him if you're never going to thaw him out?  He just doesn't want to throw them out.  He means he loves them.  You don't have a cat lovers.  You know, like older women, like kind of soccer moms.  They have like their collections.  Like, I don't know.  They might collect pigs or penguins.  And the whole house is filled with, yeah, unicorns.  You think he like plays with the cats.  He breaks them out of the freezer and lines them up and stuff.  Yeah.  And admires his collection. 
[03:36:00]  It's like rubbing a hamburger with freezer burn on it.  He gets a little white stuff under his fingernail.  It's like from a freezer.  And he puts them back.  Do you know how many fleas they must have in that fucking house?  Oh, yeah.  They must be infested with fleas.  Do you think he like has to push a lot of dead cats away just to get to the milk or the frozen food?  Yeah.  Let me see what's in here.  Dead cats.  Dead cats.  I imagine he didn't save freezer for regular food.  It's all probably in this.  Look at him.  He's like starving.  I don't know.  Why would he do this?  Let's see if we can find out more. 
[03:36:30]  There was an excessive amount of animals in this one particular house.  He was not in the best of shapes.  He was in pretty bad shape.  There was a strong stench of a strong odor of feces in urine.  Now, Michael Parnell is charged with resisting arrest at this point.  Animal cruelty charges could be coming once this investigation concludes.  At this point, he doesn't face charges.  But they've got to determine how these 300 cats died, whether or not he killed them, whether or not someone else killed them, or whether or not they just died of natural causes, and he froze them in the freezer. 
[03:37:00]  So a very disturbing and weird story.  Yeah, that is very bizarre.  Also, where did they come from?  We have to thaw the bodies out, Sam.  Oh, Jim C.  I want to do a full autopsy.  An autopsy?  Why would you want to do that?  On a cat?  Yeah.  The cause of death.  They were drinking the water.  It was contaminated, Sam.  I could only talk to her, old Colonel of Quarantine.  He has teeth, shit dick. 
[03:37:30]  So he's going to go to the live stage show of Cats and try to get up on stage so he could talk to the crowd.  There's a young girl.  I understand she wants to sleep with an older man in a members-only jacket.  On a boat?  On a boat, I have an Asian friend whose face is as flat as these cats.  Sam, the fat, flat...  Sometimes I don't talk too good when I'm trying to make fun of Sam's fat face. 
[03:38:00]  Flat?  Yes.  What's flatter, the bottom of the dead cat, Sam's face, or your girlfriend's ass?  I don't want to feed into that type of talk.  There's a girl.  There's a girl.  I just want to talk to her.  If I could only talk to them.  There's a girl.  A beautiful girl.  We're going to help her.  She's innocent, but she's in danger.  Is she?  Hey, we're just an escape, though. 
[03:38:30]  That was very well written.  Very organic teenage dialogue.  Keep waiting out there for the catchphrase.  The fucking giant crowd outside wants fucking the catchphrase.  It's not going to happen.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Sorry, folks.  I'm not predictable.  He was made!  Whoa!  Never say no to your people.  Never say no to your people.  Nothing makes you feel good about your radio show than seeing that three people showed up for the show. 
[03:39:00]  That's true.  Could be worse.  By three.  Oh, shit.  Check a text.  Let's go to Mark in Tennessee.  Mark.  Hey, guys.  When is Foundry going to have the video uploaded of Remove Your Cat?  Remove Your Cat?  Oh, boy.  Oh, crap.  You'll never be able to find it.  It's behind Cam Girl number 1406.  That's right.  Win a Foundry logo pair of underpants. 
[03:39:30]  Let's not forget, his new name is, well, his new title is Super Duper Executive Producer.  That's cool.  Yes, we like that.  That's right.  Because we don't want him to feel like someone might be trying to take over his job.  Of course not.  Why would he?  The guy's got his job.  There's only a three-hour show.  Yeah.  It's easy.  Two-hour shit dick doesn't look good on a business card.  No, dude.  You don't need to stand.  This fucking whole thing's a mess.  Fucking car.  We're actually broadcasting from a bus that's crashing. 
[03:40:00]  Fucking mind-bending.  I enjoyed the ride as we head toward the fucking cliff.  Towards a fucking brick wall.  Right.  With a cliff on the other side of it in case we happen to pass through.  Fucking Jim, man.  All right.  You want to do one more or you want to do Line of the Day?  What time is it?  I don't look at the clock.  Me neither.  I'm having so much fun, I never look at the clock. 
[03:40:30]  I don't...  It's 1054.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  This is how you know you're anxious to get out.  If someone's talking about something.  And then someone just asks you what time it is.  Like, yeah, I thought it was a good movie.  Yeah, it was a good movie.  What time is it?  1054!  Only five minutes to go!  Six.  Oh, yeah.  I round it off because it's like 1054 in 40 seconds.  I have 1053 on the old iPhone and the iPhone don't lie.  That means we got seven more minutes to go.  Just like Shakira's hips. 
[03:41:00]  Actually, this is a really good story.  Ah, shit.  White Clef.  No, that shit don't lie.  Man, I'm going to fucking win with the Fugees and shit.  Ah, shit.  Ah, shit.  Ah, shit.  Is this insomniac, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm tired.  I only got a couple hours.  I mean, especially depression, I only got a couple hours.  I'm going to go home and just flick my dick.  Right now, it's so small.  It looks like the fucking tail of a piglet.  But dirtier. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, look at that fucking Hillary.  What, she just go three rounds in the gym sparring?  That fucking towel around her neck?  That's a scar for something, Jimmy.  Oh, I hope he gets caught in a fucking helicopter.  Omar's okay.  She's fucking hanging like Omar from a fucking...  Fucking...  I go, Omar.  Stupid mullet blown in the breeze.  Omar.  You expect me to believe that Hillary was a lesbian because everyone says so?  I like how after Omar was long gone and they're talking about him, Tony just kind of points 
[03:42:00]  at the sky when he was talking about him.  All right, Omar.  And he kind of points up.  Like, you remember the last time you saw him bloody and hanging out of the copter a couple  of seconds ago?  I love it.  He says, Omar's okay.  He hates him.  Yeah, yeah.  Five grand.  All right, we got another cute news story and then we're going to...  Tony.  We'll make this quick and painless.  Here we go.  A man's arms were pinned in machinery.  Amazingly, he managed to dial 911 on his cell phone with his toes. 
[03:42:30]  Why is that amazing?  Because most people have on shoes and would dial nine pound, one, two, three, one, two,  three.  Why is that amazing?  It might not have been the first attempt either.  Absolutely.  He might have called a few other people first, checked his messages.  That would be amazing.  Yeah, that's amazing.  And the motherfucker sent a text message. 
[03:43:00]  CokeLogic is promoting onaradio.com.  Is that a good site?  I see, like, fan sites popping up that are just want to talk about the show.  Oh, and then they'll eventually go bad.  Yeah, eventually turn to shit and go bad.  Oh, I don't know.  CokeLogic.  This golf cart chase is really hysterical.  I know.  What happened, Dan?  I don't know.  It's in Vegas.  That's all I know.  Suspect makes off in golf cart.  Oh, boy.  He didn't get too far on the floor, did he?  Then he just fell over.  There he is laying in rocks. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's never good.  He should have hidden a tree.  Police never would have found him in a tree.  In a good old tree.  Hang up on a tree.  Pretend you're an apple.  Here we go.  With his toes, NBC 15's Jenna Susco is live in Pensacola, where the man is recovering  at a local hospital.  And, Jenna, rescue workers say it may have ended much differently if he didn't think on  his feet.  Yeah, that's right.  See?  Oh, God.  This guy's a heel.  He's thinking on his feet. 
[03:44:00]  See?  This guy's a heel.  Oh, I see.  But he had to arch from one part of the story.  Oh, this little piggy went to market.  Get it?  If he didn't think on his feet.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right, Greg.  He would have been stuck for at least several more hours.  An ambulance or a tow truck.  Oh, wow.  That's in debate footage.  Oh, hey.  Hey, hey, Paula.  I'm so sorry, Greg.  Oh, thank God we got a delay.  They can't figure it out if they start flipping channels.  Not at least several more hours waiting for the morning cruise to arrive. 
[03:44:30]  What?  Am I tired?  Onaradio.com is K-Rock, Opie.  Home of the show rundown.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you kind of said it.  Wow.  You don't know.  That was a shit-talking site?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, fuck them.  All right, listen.  We had a corporate event last night we had to deal with.  Wow.  Waiting for the morning cruise to arrive.  Now, officials can't release his name to us, but they do tell us doctors were able to save both of his arms,  all because he was able to dial his cell phone using his feet. 
[03:45:00]  What kind of machine was it?  Yeah, they don't even go into the detail.  The call came from inside DRS Technologies at 2 a.m. Thursday morning.  I'm calling from my cell phone.  I'm stuck in a piece of machinery.  I'm the only one in the building.  I would have said, what's a cell phone?  Yes.  Just really fucking the guy.  What?  You're calling from your cell phone?  I'm stuck in a piece of machinery.  But he got the message out quick.  He didn't bullshit.  No. 
[03:45:30]  Good thing he doesn't have a fucking iPhone.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Call failed.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, look.  Little finger.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Move your finger lightly along the glass.  Ha!  Fucking asshole Steve Jobs.  Can I take a picture of my cock and send it?  No!  Send it to a little website, and it comes up the size of a postage stamp.  Thank God.  I made this guy at Verizon.  Wait, you can't email pictures with the iPhone right there? 
[03:46:00]  No, you can email them, but you can't just, like, text them.  Yeah.  Let's say I took a picture.  Oh, that's what I meant.  Like, you can't send me a picture that way right now?  I didn't know that.  No, I get a thing that says...  Not through text.  No, it says, you have a message.  I thought you got the BlackBerry.  Oh, you have to go to the fucking web.  Viewmymessage.com.  It fucking stinks.  And you can see it the size of a postage stamp.  Yeah, it's awful.  And then what happens?  And then what happens?  Then you click on it, and then you have to see it.  No, it doesn't get bigger when you click on it.  No.  All right.  Back to the story.  It's shit.  I got to hear cell phone again.  Morning.  I'm calling for my cell phone.  I'm stuck in a piece of machinery. 
[03:46:30]  I'm the only one in the building.  Okay, what are you stuck in?  What type of machinery?  Like it matters.  I broke my arm, so I can't get out.  How about the address?  How are you calling me?  How are you calling me?  Oh, my God.  This guy is just like, look, just send someone.  Maybe someone was there and dialed the phone for him, you idiot.  How are you calling me?  You're full of shit.  How are you calling me?  I'm calling you on my cell phone.  Okay, but you're pinned? 
[03:47:00]  I am pinned, right.  He had to move his hip to knock his phone off of his belt  and then remove his shoes with his feet  and dial 911 with his toes.  Very smart.  Yeah.  Good luck with the iPhone.  You'd have to fucking put your big toe on that little arrow  and try to scoop it to the left.  Scoop it with your toe.  Your toes have to dance lightfully along the glass.  We got more of the 911 call. 
[03:47:30]  It was his only option.  His arms were being crushed by a press-like machine  and no one would be in until the morning.  Are we going to be able to get in the building?  I don't know.  They're on the way right now, okay?  With his arms pinned, he was able to tell Cruz how to find him.  Here!  I'm over here!  This is great.  That's a good plan.  That's all your fucking larynx was pinned.  I'm over here!  How would that have helped if his arms weren't pinned?  He would have waved and they would have heard it? 
[03:48:00]  Well, that would have been funny if one of the rescue workers said,  Where?  Where?  Wave your hand.  I can't see you.  I can't.  They're in the machine.  Stop ironing your arms, sir.  There's a problem here.  What kind of fucking pressure this asshole caught in?  I don't know.  Here!  I'm over here!  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm here!  They were able to go outside of the facility and shut down a compressor that controlled  the unit. 
[03:48:30]  And by doing that, they could take a halogen pry bar that we have on the trucks, lift the  press unit up to free his arms, secure it in place, and extricate the patient.  It's amazing.  He's a lucky man.  Smart man.  We did contact DRS Technologies for a comment about how the accident happened.  They told me it's still under investigation.  But guys, you know what?  This really is truly an amazing story.  I was looking at my phone, and I'm guessing that it probably wasn't a flip phone.  But if it was, I'm sure he probably could have figured that out also. 
[03:49:00]  Why don't you just look at his phone, stupid?  Do I speculate?  He's not in the ocean, dead.  Why are you speculating?  Fucking asshole.  How did he get his hands caught in the fucking...  They're the same in every city, in every town.  He said, you're a terminated fucker, and the machine came out of his arms.  You're trying to clip his nails with a fucking meat grinder.  What a douche.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, rumor has it the guy was actually trapped in the foundrymusic.com  website. 
[03:49:30]  That's right.  I was shaving my arms and a machine fell on them because they're very hairy.  Get it?  Yes.  And that's how you dial a phone with your feet.  I have another meeting with Stunt Brain.  Yes, let me call Stunt Brain.  I'm trying to help him.  Let's see what he would do in this situation.  Would I rather talk to Stunt Brain or stick both arms in this machine?  I'm over here.  I'm over here.  It's Stunt Arms.  I got my arms stuck in a press. 
[03:50:00]  I said I'm tired in a fucking, where they get the fucking honey.  Oh.  I'm stuck in a fucking bear.  In a beehive.  In a beehive.  In a beehive.  What the fuck's wrong with me?  Help me.  I'm stuck in a beehive.  Right.  I'm dying with my rear claws and I just shit on my phone.  Yes.  And it's caught in my ass hair.  It's old printer press arms.  I was trying to print a newspaper on my hands and arms. 
[03:50:30]  Distribution one.  Fucking.  Thank you.  Fucking Dickie Punchcock.  He had another one that I didn't get to use, but this one from Wackbag.  He writes, smart man.  If he was smart, he wouldn't have tried to get a manicure from a meat grinder.  That's what I said.  He's clipping his nails with a meat grinder.  I didn't hear you, Dan.  That happens.  If he was fucking smart, he wouldn't have tried to paint his nails with a meat grinder. 
[03:51:00]  Jesus.  That's funny.  Why does it all go back to Steve?  I don't know why.  Yes.  We're obsessed with him.  What the hell is that?  Sorry.  You fart?  I've had male farts all morning.  Just disgusting.  He's getting heavy.  What happened?  He's getting what?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Stop it.  Oh.  Someone's got therapy today. 
[03:51:30]  Here comes line of the day.  Yeah.  It's brought to you by AshleyMadison.com, Anthony.  If you're looking for a little something on the side, and you don't have an extremely popular  radio show, you might want to go to AshleyMadison.com.  Do yourself a favor and check out AshleyMadison.com for a little tail.  A little tail, right?  Tail?  Is that what you're getting?  John from Virginia.  I got to work on my Steve voice, because I really want to be part of this movie, you 
[03:52:00]  guys.  He writes them.  Just sound like an ass.  My arms are stuck in my Prius, and it's flying away.  Help me.  I'm over here.  Yes.  I didn't realize it said press.  I thought it said Prius.  A printing Prius.  I was going to take a photo of the car.  Please, just look where nobody's working.  I was trying to upload something, and my arms got crouched. 
[03:52:30]  Get me, stunt brain.  Get me, stunt brain, on the phone.  I was catnapping, and the machine turned on.  What a fool.  I was trying to fax myself to XM to get there quicker.  No, I suck. 
[03:53:00]  Danny, do the voice.  Let's go.  Yes, have fun.  What the fuck?  My arms were stuck in the Goat Sea Man.  You know the picture of that guy with his asshole open, ridiculously large?  That's the Goat Sea Man.  That's the Goat Sea Man.  I didn't know his name.  I didn't know this guy had a name.  Goat Sea Man.  Help.  I'm stuck.  Bob Kelly rolled over on my arms.  He's got the shits, and I can't get him off of me.  That's right. 
[03:53:30]  It looks like the waterfall in Willy Wonka's factory.  I'm really queer.  I'm really queer.  I mean, I'm over here.  What's, sir, sir, sir, what is trapping you?  What's on your arms?  Cock meat.  Nothing but cock meat.  That much cock meat will send people right away, sir.  Let's do the runner-up line of the day. 
[03:54:00]  Yes.  New Matthew Bodewin are horrified someone would run him over after such a silly argument.  What they say is actions speak louder than...  Who isn't going to be...  A couple of people who knew him said they always expected him to be mowed down intentionally by a drunk driver.  That seems like yesterday's show at this point.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Did you know I did the toothpick thing one time at a party where I kept all the little meat in the deli sandwich from tipping over. 
[03:54:30]  Let me tell you something.  Toothpick tricks.  Wow.  So do toothpick trick jokes.  You weren't whistling Dixie on that one.  Oh, boy.  Swing in this.  The final runner-up line of the day.  They weren't like retarded kids or anything, weren't they?  No, no.  They were regular.  Just regular kids.  That could be understandable.  I could fucking tell.  Ratham jumped out the window.  I got a call. 
[03:55:00]  Toothpick.  The wizardry story was a hit today.  Wizardry story.  Oh, the Q West commercial is so cute.  Look at that.  Then he makes a tree.  How did he do that?  I like that.  He's doing it as some kind of sand.  How did he do that, Jimmy?  I don't know.  It was sand.  And what is Q West?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's like Quest with a Q. 
[03:55:30]  All right.  We can all do Casey and the Sunshine Band beats  so we can fucking do line of the day  and I can get out of here and take a nice piss and shit.  Let's go.  Let's have a jam session.  All right.  Nah.  Jimmy.  They told me bad news and good news.  The good news is you get to sleep later. 
[03:56:00]  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I spoke with the assistant superintendent of the Pasco County School District  who said it wasn't just the wizardry  and that Piculous had other performance issues, 
[03:56:30]  including not following lesson plans.  What, what, what, what, what, go.  Ew.  That is creepy, that guy.  That's good.  I think I was molested by him.  Back of the day.  That was a joke.  Yeah.  Don't look at me like this.  I don't know.  All right.  I guess that's it. 
[03:57:00]  Yep.  Come on, Jimmy.  No.  I got the beat going.  Let's go.  I don't have any songs.  No?  Maybe.  What's the beat?  I don't know.  All right.  Oh, stunt brain.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  Likes to bowl a turkey or two.  Yeah, this bus is heading toward the cliff.  It's.  And no one can stop it. 
[03:57:30]  The brakes have failed.  Right.  There's a brick wall with a cliff behind it.  And fucking, it's on fire.  Yeah.  We're headed towards it with our fucking dumb chins out.  We're hoping.  It'll all work out.  We're hoping that someone's going to paint like a, like a tunnel entrance, like in the  cartoons, and we're going to be okay.  Two different companies emerging when we last year.  Two different shows.  Best of, competing against ourselves.  It's a fucking abomination.  There's no way to spin it.  They don't want to work with each other.  We're everywhere and nowhere at the same time. 
[03:58:00]  They love you in the U.S. and Canada.  But not Philadelphia.  Not Los Angeles.  All right, good.  We'll take you off here.  We're leaving you here.  We don't like you here.  But you're killing the arbitrage ratings here.  But all the PPM is really good here.  Not particularly good there.  Well, internal, internal stuff says he did really good.  And then once that on exam, arbitrage said no one's listening to you.  They're all listening to Howard.  It's a fucking nightmare.  It's so complicated.  Dude, just in New York alone, one day I called up corporate.  I go, so how are the ratings? 
[03:58:30]  And they're like, oh, you don't want to know.  I'm like, well, I kind of do.  I mean, we do this show.  Yeah.  Kind of do.  Well, they weren't that good.  And so then Ant and I were depressed for a day.  And then the PPMs came out.  And all of a sudden, they're calling our phones.  They're ringing off the hook.  We have great news.  Great news.  Ratings ruled.  What the fuck does that mean?  Help me out here and tell me.  The rating system that, thank God, is going away in, I think, three months, not so good  in New York.  But the new ratings that don't start until November, real good.  Yeah.  With the same shitty rating system going away here, says, hey, you guys are terrific in 
[03:59:00]  Boston.  So we buy it.  No good here.  Good there.  That's a fucking whole life just sucks.  We got two executive producers now that are now going to have like a chemistry problem.  They're going to be fighting it out, wondering who the top dog is.  It's fucking all.  That's smart.  There's going to be a fucking red line and like stunt brands going to hand papers over  it to Steve.  No one's going to cross that red line.  It's like fucking North Korea, South Korea.  They got to kind of communicate in some sort of way. 
[03:59:30]  In some capacity.  Barely.  I understand.  That's why I picked Korea.  Not stupid.  Here's the phone call we're going to get sometime next week.  Hello.  My CBS ID is not working.  I can't seem to get in the building.  I'm over here.  Open the door.  The beauty of this whole thing is Steve has no idea that the writing's on the wall.  No.  It's not that I don't know.  I'm just.  Get all my ducks in a row. 
[04:00:00]  There you go.  By the way, because I don't want to deal with the phone call after the show.  That was purely for joke purposes, Steve.  Exactly.  The writing's in blood.  Oh, my fucking God.  What?  Yeah, and then the company says, yeah, you're not good in this city, but you're really good  in this city.  How does that work?  You can't feel comfortable anywhere.  And then the shows they replaced us in in some of these markets are doing way, way worse 
[04:00:30]  than we ever did.  But I'll tell you what it is.  They're paying them way less.  I know.  That's the problem.  And also, they can get them to go do the local shit.  We all know that.  I mean, it's like, you know.  Right.  They're probably still saving money because they're paying them nothing.  And people will still advertise.  Shit, whatever.  So, we'll just enjoy this until they say, you know what?  How's Lopweiser's show doing on West Palm?  Awful.  Good.  The show in Dallas that took over our hours.  Awful.  Is it bad?  I thought they were like a local show.  The Philly station in general, because I don't know how well Kid Chris is doing. 
[04:01:00]  I really don't.  Yeah.  But I know the station lost 40% of their cume since we left Philly.  40%.  40%.  40 fucking percent.  Nice.  And especially with Philly.  Philly, man, that was a slow one, man.  I'm not going to lie to you.  We killed the first time in Philly, and it was a tough sell.  But we were turning it around when they got rid of us, and that's why that one is so fucking frustrating.  It's because of fucking XM's competition at times makes it difficult. 
[04:01:30]  I mean, there had to be a way to work those two things.  Because, look, XM is...  I did Minneapolis.  I did 1,000 people in Minneapolis.  We've never been on there.  And we've never been on regular radio.  Never.  That's all XM, man.  I just did a...  They're HBO fans, though, Jimmy.  Nah, it's mostly opening up.  When stupid Kenny walks out of the stage, they all cheer.  Really?  They all saw the special, but it's from the show.  I'd say 75% to 80% of people that come to see me know me specifically from this show.  A couple know me from fucking...  Whether it's Tough Crowd or this... 
[04:02:00]  But it's almost...  Maybe even 85% know me from the O&A show.  Right.  I mean...  Ooh.  Dude, you might have to check...  You might have to check that one.  No, but that was a fucking warm, bubbly one.  Oh, isn't that nice?  And it goes down your leg a little bit, but just the warmness, nothing else?  No, nothing came out.  I like when you get a little shot of warm air and you know there's nothing else going  on.  Just a little shot of...  I hope right now...  Warm air.  I hope Bob is on the toilet.  His feet are black because he's been leaning on his legs so long. 
[04:02:30]  I hope his feet are like two of those frozen cats.  He's got to put him down.  How bad?  People have got to come up and put a tent around him and shoot him.  I'm over here, dude!  How bad do you guys want to talk to Bob Kelly?  Like, I...  Oh, in person.  Unbelievable.  Let's go over to his house and just, like, fucking bother him.  I want to push him off the toilet.  Yeah.  And just watch him tumble onto his side with shit coming out.  Yeah.  We came here to see...  We came here to see your relics.  Where are they?  I hope it's fucking...  I hope it's like the fucking taboo from fucking the Brady Bunch. 
[04:03:00]  I hope he wipes out on his surfboard.  Right.  Fucking a thing falls off a bed and almost hits him.  Dude!  Dude!  Relics.  What relics he brought back in his intestines?  Fucking mud.  Yeah, no kidding.  He brought back some mud.  What an ass.  I hope whatever he was was confiscated at the airport and they broke it.  Dude!  It's a little plastic lizard!  Can't bring that into the country, idiot.  Yeah.  They might have fleas.  I gotta piss again.  Well, guys, I guess we'll see you tomorrow morning. 
[04:03:30]  I mean, you know.  Fuck, man.  We have...  The last ten minutes would have been good on the radio.  Oh, I thought we were on the radio.  Oh, look at that.  I'm off the air.  We're not on the radio, Jimmy.  We haven't been in a long time.  All right.  Somebody's got a wee-wee.  I gotta go see my spiritual advisor today. 
[04:04:00]  Oh.  Where are you going, Jimmy?  What?  Where are you going?  I have to piss again.  Yeah, what's wrong?  I always piss a lot.  So do I.  I got a great joke.  Yeah.  If I was at night, my name would be Sir Piss-a-Lot.  That's funny.  See, right there.  That's funny.  Yeah.  That's humor.  That's humor.  Well, um...  Bye, guys.  You're not going anywhere without me.  Oh, I get what you say.  All right.  Goodbye, Ant. 
[04:04:30]  Goodbye, Oak.  Goodbye, Thanikins.  Out and Z.  All right.  Let's go take leeks.  We'll all just go and take leeks.  Swing that big boy cock out here, kid.  You got it.  Look out.  Oh, you'll suck.  Is it tempting?  Jimmy.  Jimmy's shirt day is officially over.  It was a fucking hit.  It was a hit.  It was a hit.  Goofy gags to play on your uncircumcised pals.  Funny things to do with foreskin.  One was you put fucking a little crazy glue around the rim, and you put it around an exhaust 
[04:05:00]  pipe, the foreskin, and then you drive away.  Fucking pull the skin aside and dump rock salt in there.  Clean that out, you fucking baboon cock.  One was itching powder in the fucking thing, and then you staple it shut on top.  Dirty fucking European dick.  You stand a fucking uncut guy against the wall, and you lay on your back, you put your feet  on his thighs, and you grab his foreskin with both hands, and you pull it up to your  chest, and you let it snap like a window shade.  And it will actually make the noise.  I have to fill that skinny fucking fleshy pouch with crushed glass, and then fucking smash 
[04:05:30]  my fist out.  Goofy gags to play on your uncircumcised pals.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hit the bricks, crusader dick. </pre>
