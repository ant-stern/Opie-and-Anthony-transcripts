<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a surprisingly conciliatory message from William Donahue of the Catholic League, wishing the hosts well.  This is immediately followed by the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and highly offensive humor, referring to themselves and their crew by a barrage of vulgar nicknames.  Listener calls follow, with "Rude Dog" criticizing their failure to correct Frank Vincent's mispronunciation of Joaquin Phoenix's name, and Mike from Boston offering his passionate opinions on the Red Sox/Yankees game, prompting a discussion of "Sandman" and Mike and the Mad Dog's sports radio show.  Frank Vincent's age and musical knowledge are also debated. A Tool ticket contest winner is announced, sparking conversation about creating women-only contests.  Doug, another caller, insults the hosts, leading to a playful but aggressive exchange.  The hosts then advertise an upcoming "walk" and reveal the contents of Howard Stern's mail they plan to distribute – pornography and comics.

Opie recounts a humorous anecdote about Kurt Russell and a rude woman in an IMAX theater, leading to a wider discussion on movie theater etiquette and tall people obstructing views.  *American Idol*, *Poseidon*, and other pop culture events are discussed.  Jesse (Jasmine), a caller attempting to win Tool tickets, struggles to provide her MySpace details and answer basic questions, resulting in her missing out.  The show plays audio of Howard Stern complaining about his inability to book the same A-list guests (like Richard Dreyfuss and Kurt Russell) as Opie and Anthony, followed by a short clip of their interview with Dreyfuss. The show concludes this segment with a discussion of Britney Spears’ pregnancy, *American Idol*, and Taylor Hicks.

The next segment opens with a discussion of Taylor Hicks’ "In the Ghetto" performance on *American Idol*, comparing it to other contestants' Elvis covers.  Tommy Mottola's *American Idol* appearance and his omission of Mariah Carey’s name are analyzed, with callers speculating about a possible divorce clause.  The conversation then shifts to Britney Spears and Kevin Federline ("K-Fed"), involving vulgar jokes about K-Fed’s perceived opportunism. Listener feedback, including comments about a host’s appearance and another’s pregnancy, is addressed. A significant portion focuses on a New Jersey bear on the loose, featuring news reports and various listener reactions, from amusement to outrage at the decision to kill it. A caller recounts a terrifying personal encounter with a large bear.  A New York City subway flasher caught by a victim using her cellphone is discussed, prompting debate on the hosts' views on public indecency. David Blaine’s poorly-rated underwater stunt and a news story about a rise in oral and anal sex among young people are also covered, leading to more vulgar commentary.

A made-for-TV movie about bird flu, "Fatal Contact," becomes the central topic of another segment. The hosts, possibly with a guest, mercilessly mock the film's plot, acting, and dialogue with graphic descriptions of death by bird flu, focusing on the "Connellys" family.  The conversation branches out to Ebola, Hurricane Katrina, airport security, and the hosts' merchandise ("Wow stickers").  A substantial portion details Big A’s PalTalk phone sex with an Australian woman, playing clips from the video chat and heavily criticizing the audio quality and Big A’s appearance. A caller from Massachusetts discusses the show’s presence in Boston.  A live segment from their walk outside the studio, featuring interactions with various people, is included. E-Rock's absence is repeatedly noted.  The "dump report" is discussed, and Zagman calls in to promote his restaurant.  The segment concludes with further discussion of the bird flu movie and the Big A PalTalk video.

A segment heavily features a recurring bit about Big A's penis size, shown in a video, with relentless and graphic jokes from the hosts and callers. James Carville calls in, discussing his new sports radio show, his past criticisms of Opie and Anthony, and current political events.  Howard Stern's purported denial of a return to terrestrial radio is discussed, along with speculation on his motivations.  The segment concludes with a short discussion of video game consoles and technology. Blaze Angel's reaction to the video of Big A's penis is also played.

The final segment begins with a discussion of in-car computers and internet radio, followed by joking regrets about past rejections of internet radio opportunities.  A news story about concentrating sex offenders in one area leads to sexually explicit jokes.  The hosts discuss sex robots, blow-up dolls, and the state of sex toy technology, criticizing Phillips' DVR technology and its impact on advertising. Anecdotes about accidentally hitting the "live" button on their DVRs are shared. The conversation shifts to drones, law enforcement surveillance, privacy concerns, the NSA's alleged access to AT&T communications, and the balance between national security and civil liberties.  The show concludes with a sexually explicit "Guess What's in My Pants" game with a female Paltalk caller, ending with the caller hanging up.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue, president of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounced back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambaste Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people. You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well. I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well. 
[00:00:30]  Push the button! Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No! Shut up!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow.  We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You stare like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up! 
[00:01:30]  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax. Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian S.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony program. 
[00:02:00]  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Thanks for joining us this morning.  This wonderful morning.  We've got to be on our game because Whoopi Goldberg will be doing morning radio soon.  Uh-oh.  There's some trouble.  Another Hollywood douche trying radio. 
[00:02:30]  Good luck, Whoopi.  Have fun.  It's easy.  Everyone's found that out.  A lot of celebrities that have taken to the airwaves have found out how easy it is to just get on and do a show.  For, I don't know, four hours.  Didn't that used to be the way you did radio?  You just did a four-hour shift?  Yeah, right.  What did we do?  Six hours yesterday?  We did six hours of radio yesterday.  We might do four today.  No, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  We might reach four.  I'm looking for three and change.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  We've got to talk about Big A this morning.  God.  This side of our show hasn't heard about Big A yet.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We'll get into that a little later because we should get him on the phone and everything.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Right to the phones we go.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Rude Dog.  Rude Dog, what's up? 
[00:03:30]  Man, um.  Hi, sir.  I want to make a point about yesterday's show.  Okay, sir.  Welcome to the program, Rude Dog.  Hey, big slot, man.  I was just pretty pissed off about it yesterday.  Like, you guys had the balls to get to Stern, which was really cool.  I would buy that on Superview.  But Frank Vincent called Leonard Skinner.  Oh, I don't listen to him.  And then later on, he called Joaquin Phoenix, um, Jockin.  Yeah, you know. 
[00:04:00]  Like, I said, have the balls to, like, hey, dude, you know, that would have been great radio.  Dude, I can't hear a word you're saying.  Dude, I can't hear a word you're talking.  I have no idea what he said.  I think I know what he said.  Wait, let's, uh, what did he say?  He was talking about Frank Vincent mispronouncing Joaquin Phoenix's name and us not calling him out on it.  I heard that in the replay.  Uh, but, but it's like, you know, dude, the, the, the, the guy's an older, respected gentleman.  And plus the bottom line is, he's a celebrity, sir. 
[00:04:30]  You don't question celebrities.  The second one of us trip up, we go for the throat.  That's right.  I honestly didn't even notice.  I didn't notice until the replay.  Yeah, I didn't even notice there.  Okay, I, I, I understand that, dude.  But it's just like, I thought that would have been great radio to confront that dude.  Then go get a radio show.  Nah, he, right, dude.  I, I, look, hey, you're preaching to the choir.  Uh, no one, to say to the guy, hey, it's not Joaquin, it's Joaquin.  I mean, we probably could have got an hour out of that.  But we dropped the ball. 
[00:05:00]  We dropped the ball on that one, sir.  All right, all right, dude.  We're not perfect broadcasters, sir.  Let's take it easy.  All right, thank you, Root Dog.  Let me just say that.  You guys kick ass for saying that.  Root Dog is just, uh, breaking my balls and, uh, right away he's getting fresh.  Getting fresh.  Right off the bat.  Joaquin, Joaquin.  Hey, Joaquin, dog.  Hey, man, you guys rule.  All right, Root Dog.  Thank you, my friend, Root Dog.  Let's go to Mike in Boston.  Mikey, what's up?  Of course, here comes the Boston call.  Let's rock.  All right.  Let's rock. 
[00:05:30]  Go ahead.  We'll take it.  We'll take it, Mike.  Go ahead.  Hey, listen.  Hey, Norton.  How did it feel to lose big time last night?  It was like the past week.  Oh, that score wasn't two.  New York.  We came into New York.  I actually didn't.  We took no prisoners.  You know your team is back with Alex Gonzalez.  It's a home run off, you guys.  14-3.  A few errors.  And the big unit stunk up the joint.  The big unit only went four innings. 
[00:06:00]  He's a piece of garbage.  You guys got nothing.  It's going to be Boston all the way, guys.  Come on.  Stunk up the joint.  They're all Psycho Mark clones up there.  I love it.  I don't care about the Yankees.  I don't like this team.  I don't want a team that's built like this.  Someone told me that the Yankees, since 2000, have spent a billion dollars in salary and have  gotten nothing out of it because they did so well in the 80s getting the older gentleman  throwing a baseball at age 56. 
[00:06:30]  Nobody wants Randy Johnson, sir.  I'm rooting for David Ortiz to drive a line drive into his chest.  I hope so.  The next time he faces him, I really do.  Unfortunately, he tends to hit the balls over everybody's head and into the stands.  You know what, though?  I mean, I don't hate Giambi anymore, but I don't want him.  I wanted Nick Johnson, who was a Yankee Farm System guy who had a Down Syndrome face, and  he wore high white socks.  That's who I wanted on first base.  I didn't want Giambi.  The Giambi?  No.  We know, John.  We know.  We know. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Boston out, guys.  All right.  I think more importantly there, Mike, is the fact that they're bringing out Rivera to  and the Sandman, and other people are taking his song.  This is outrageous, Mikey.  They shouldn't be taking a song.  Obviously, everybody knows that's a song, and it comes out to every time.  He's in a Sandman, and then you've got other pitches that want to use the same power song.  That's an hour of age, Mikey.  A dog?  Yeah, for the rest of the country, Mike and the Mad Dog, a sports show here in New York  City, had a whole, what, hour discussion?  Dude, if it was an hour, it wouldn't have been as bad. 
[00:07:30]  It was two hours.  It was two hours?  Going off the bat, however, is the only one in the Major League Baseball that ought to  be pulling out the Sandman when he takes the field.  Other pitches, you know, they notice.  He's been doing it for years.  There shouldn't be anybody else coming out there in the Sandman.  They're making.  Tell them, Fred.  Tell them, Fred.  Who, who?  I love sports radio.  They could go off for hours on the littlest thing. 
[00:08:00]  The littlest thing.  Hours.  Plus, they don't ever get a chance to talk about music, so anytime they get a chance to  talk about something interesting, like a song, they're not going to let it go.  Yeah.  Oh, and Mike had no clue what it even was.  I don't know what band that is, dog.  What is that, Sinatra?  No, you adult.  Pick something from, you know, the last 50 decades.  I was surprised yesterday that Frank Vincent didn't know Freebird by Leonard Skinner.  That didn't surprise me.  He's not that old. 
[00:08:30]  He's, how old is he?  He's got to be.  How old is, I'm punching it up.  He was playing music for 25 years at one point.  I will go with, um...  Let's look.  Oh, maybe he is a little old.  I'm going to go with, say, 65.  I was going to say, like, 62, 63.  When did Goodfellas come out?  92, I believe.  92?  Yeah.  Frank Vincent was born on the 4th of August, 1939.  So, 60...  I was off by a year. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, yeah, 67.  He'll be 67 this year.  67.  It's called pushing 70.  Leonard Skinner, they go back 30 years easy.  I put him back, how old was he in 76?  He was 40 when he did Goodfellas?  I'm sorry, Raging Bull.  Wow, okay.  No.  Yeah.  No.  That's 26 years ago.  Oh, 26 years ago, okay.  26 years ago is 39...  He's 80.  That's Raging Bull. 
[00:09:30]  Wow.  So, he was 40 when he did Raging Bull.  So, here's what we do in the business, is you find anyone who's, like, big beginning  was older than you are now.  Right.  And then you use that to feel better?  I have a couple of years left.  Like, you still got a shot.  Sure.  I, too, can do classes.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're running out of people like that, though, every day.  Yeah, usually they're eight by the time they have their first nomination.  Really fast.  We've got to go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, man?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, it's pretty funny.  If you listen to that Mike and the Mad Dog rant about Sandman, Mike says, trying to 
[00:10:00]  sound like he does know what he's talking about, he says, yeah, dog, he goes, he should  be the only one coming in to enter Rain Man.  Enter Rain Man?  Enter Rain Man.  That's Mikey's music prowess.  Enter Rain Man.  Oh, that's very funny.  Hey, you don't have any tool tickets for me, man, do you?  Yeah, we still have those tool tickets to give away.  We overestimated our ability to draw women into this studio this early in our tenure. 
[00:10:30]  We've got to be honest.  We failed miserably with our tool ticket contest.  I was hoping I could be like a random bastard, you know?  You know what?  You are a random bastard today.  You made it.  Yes, you are, Mike, in New Jersey.  You're going to go see Tool this weekend.  No.  You know what?  Well.  Well.  You know something?  We should take away bonus points for cursing like that on regular radio, my friend.  What?  I can't say Rain Man?  No.  Mike in Jersey, congratulations. 
[00:11:00]  You have won tickets to see Tool perform live at City Center in New York on May 19th,  plus a copy of their new CD, 10,000 Days.  Hold on the line.  Travis is going to get your info.  You guys rule.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  How was Tool live?  I never saw him live.  Tool live is just amazing.  The rock?  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Very, very, very, very strange group to see live.  Because Maynard just likes to kind of like have his back to the audience.  Sometimes he's way off to the left and to the back of the stage. 
[00:11:30]  They don't do traditional stuff.  Like the singer has to be front and center.  They sound good, though.  Unbelievable.  I want him to sound like the record.  One of my favorite concerts of all time, Tool, a few years back at that joint near Madison Square Garden.  What?  Hammerstein.  Hammerstein, right.  There you go.  Yeah, but they change the name of that place all the time, don't they?  Manhattan Plaza.  Manhattan Plaza, whatever.  All right, we'll have more Tool tickets to give away.  We should have some kind of contest for the Tool tickets. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, please.  We are pathetic, man.  We were feeling so good about ourselves.  We set up this great contest, and every single person that told us they were going to show up did not show up.  We got amnesia.  We forgot that girls, very difficult to get down to the program for a thing like Tool tickets.  How about this?  If you're a woman and you show up, you get to go.  See?  That's a nice, easy way to...  All right, let's say hi to Doug in New York City.  Doug, what's up?  Nothing.  And I just wanted to say, you two half of fags need to leave Howard alone. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, okay.  Welcome to the program, Doug.  Thank you, Doug.  Thank you, Doug.  But why are you listening if we suck, Doug?  That never makes sense.  Why don't you have serious...  Like, there's radio shows out there that I know suck and I hate them, and guess what?  I just don't listen to them.  Listen, I'm only calling to bust your chops.  I can't stand the prick.  He's busting balls.  Right away, getting fresh.  Right away, you're getting fresh, Doug.  Yeah, while we're hugging and kissing over here.  Right away, he's getting fresh. 
[00:13:00]  You see us go right into defense mode?  There you go.  Rawr, the claws come out.  Hey, you know what we're doing today, by the way?  As people are learning about the program, you know, we do two shows a day.  The first half of the Opie and Anthony show, part of it is heard on terrestrial radio,  and then the second half is on XM satellite radio.  And right after this show ends, we broadcast all the way to XM, exclusively on XM.  Yes.  Today, for the walk, we give out Howard Mail. 
[00:13:30]  We have discovered.  See, we're still getting comfortable in our environment here.  We discovered today that Howard Stern still gets mail here.  And so we will be handing out Howard Mail to the fans that join us for the walk today.  There's a little giveaway.  Every morning around 8.50, we're right outside the studio, and we broadcast all the way to XM.  And we do silly things every day.  Yesterday, signs appeared for the first time.  Kind of like the Today Show.  Like that.  Yeah, just like the Today Show. 
[00:14:00]  But today, we're going to be handing out Howard Mail.  Ben, do we have Howard's Mail?  Well, what is in it?  I think today it's...  I just picture manila envelopes full of cash.  Is that it?  Today, we'll be giving out a few copies of Gent magazine.  What is Gent?  Ooh.  Is that a gay pornography?  It's a fine porn magazine.  Is it?  Looks like Howie's into the big boobed women. 
[00:14:30]  Is that what Gent is?  I think they lean toward the bigger busts.  The big boobs.  So we got three copies of Gent magazine that came to Howard Stern.  That we'll be handing out on the sidewalk today.  All right.  And also, is it the same Gent magazine, or is it three different copies?  No, it's the latest issue of Gent magazine.  The biggest boobs on the planet.  On the planet. 
[00:15:00]  So it looks like Howard loves the big boobs.  Yeah.  And also today, we have lots and lots of comic books.  He gets comic books?  He gets comic books.  Previews.  May 2006.  Hannah Barbara, new from McFarlane Toy.  Hannah Barbara.  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.  I know, I know.  I just know because I'm a cartoon retard.  So we got that.  We got a catalog for...  Joe Walken.  ...cartoon stuff and other things. 
[00:15:30]  Leonard Skinnered.  So every day, we'll be handing out Howard mail.  It's going to be our new bit.  Yeah.  It's going to take over the world.  Take over the world.  Hey, last night.  Yeah.  I went and saw Poseidon.  You went out.  Yeah, I went out.  Well, I slept like three hours during the day.  So I was able to go check out Poseidon on the iMac.  Is that the only way you can do things?  Because I know I called Opie and he was in the theater.  So he was trying to be quiet for a little while. 
[00:16:00]  Like, hello.  But I was already showered and in my jammies.  And he's out.  Out on the town.  Yeah, Anthony goes, where are you?  I'm like, I'm at the iMac.  I'm just a fag.  I'm at the iMac.  Poseidon's about to begin.  Poseidon's about to begin.  They're going to stop.  Yeah, they're telling us to turn off the cell phones.  And it was the big, like, premiere or something?  Because there are celebrities there?  No, it wasn't like a red carpet thing.  No?  No, they just had a showing of Poseidon on the iMac.  But some of the people in the movie were there, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty cool. 
[00:16:30]  I got a good story about Kurt Russell, who's one of the big stars in Poseidon.  Kurt Russell, of course.  And he did an unbelievable job.  You like the movie?  I loved Poseidon, yeah.  I thought it was great.  And just like you said, with all the latest effects and stuff, they really updated the movie.  Yeah, but all I've seen in the trailer is them having a good time cruising on the ship.  Don't ruin it for me.  I don't know what happened.  You don't know what happened?  I have no idea.  And you know me.  We've talked about this in the past.  I get bored with action movies in general.  The movies where it's one action scene after another, after another, after another, after another. 
[00:17:00]  Mission Impossible 3.  And car chases and car crashes.  I like a little of that in my movies.  But when the whole movie's like that, I can't be bothered.  I get bored really easily.  Brokeback Mountain 10th scene.  You watched Brokeback Mountain.  I haven't seen that dumb movie yet.  There's some action in there.  All right.  A little spitting on the hand, and then away they go.  I got to tell you, Poseidon is just one action scene after another.  Yeah.  Like, they do the obvious setup in the beginning, and then it's one action scene after another.  And I was completely into it from beginning to end. 
[00:17:30]  But the weird thing is, the movie started at 7, 7.05, and I turned on my phone right after the movie to see what time it was.  8.40.  I'm like, what?  It was no more than an hour and a half, this movie.  It felt like a little short.  That's a short movie.  A little short.  But besides that, I really, really enjoyed it.  But a quick funny story, or slightly funny story.  They're about to start the movie, and Kurt Russell comes walking in, and it's iMac. 
[00:18:00]  And if you go to an iMac theater, you really want the seats that are way in the back so you can take in the massive screen, right?  A full screen.  Feel like you're in the picture.  He had to kind of sit up front because he came in late because he didn't want to be bothered by all us schmucks, regular folk, just sitting there watching the movie.  So he's going down an aisle like we've all done, going to the movies.  Oh, you mean Kurt Russell's going, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me?  So Kurt Russell, he's with an older gentleman, and they decide to sit next to this black lady. 
[00:18:30]  And he starts to sit down, and the black lady actually goes, these seats are taken to Kurt Russell, right?  He's in the movie.  So Kurt Russell very politely says, oh, I'm sorry, and continues to move to find another seat, which is even a worse seat than the one he was going to take.  Why so polite?  I'd have gone, hey, Rosa Parks, get your ass up off this seat.  I'm in the movie, idiot.  It gets better.  So he moves on. 
[00:19:00]  Lady leans into the black lady from the row behind her and goes, but that was Kurt Russell.  Kurt Russell, as in, you know, he's in the movie.  Yeah.  We're fortunate enough to have Kurt Russell, the star of the movie, watching the movie with us.  And all of a sudden, her blackness came out, and she goes, I don't care who that was.  Uh-oh.  All of a sudden, she became black, like blacker.  Did she go into battle mode?  She was like, I don't know.  Did Kurt Russell have to leave his own movie like I did?  Kind of leave a movie? 
[00:19:30]  Look, Mike.  Because I was being threatened.  Look, Mike and Richman, it's early, okay?  It's IMAX.  I know that.  I said IMAX.  I'm sorry.  I'm trying to wake up.  I stayed out late last night.  Isn't that odd?  And you called a homeless guy, Mac, Max.  Yeah.  Well, so all of a sudden, you know, she goes, I don't care who that is.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I couldn't believe it.  If the guy's in the movie, you can't give him this.  If the guy's in the movie and he wants your seat, I think you're obligated to move. 
[00:20:00]  If the guy's in the movie, how about the fact that he's white?  Yeah.  She chose that.  Give him up your seat.  She chose that moment to be Rosa Parks.  Great.  Which water fountain did she decide to use out in the lobby?  That's what I want to know.  And then it was really weird because the opening scene is pretty much Kurt Russell.  So I'm watching Kurt Russell watch himself on a massive, massive IMAX screen.  Oh.  A little surreal and a little strange to me.  Yeah.  But then I was thinking, you know, it doesn't matter who you are. 
[00:20:30]  You know, he's a big Hollywood star.  He's been in a million movies, right?  Mm-hmm.  He's trying to watch himself on the IMAX opening scene and people are still getting their seats.  So they're going by him and stuff.  They're in his way.  They're in his way.  And he's trying to look around the people as they, you know, usher by him.  And I just thought that was so strange.  People suck.  I thought it was just really strange.  That's why I just cannot bring myself to go to movies anymore.  I, it's such a chore for me.  And there are certain movies like Poseidon I want to see on the big screen. 
[00:21:00]  But, uh, Mission Impossible 3 is another one.  Big action movie I'd like to see in the movie theater.  But the people just suck.  There's no sense of courtesy anymore.  There's just nothing.  There's people yapping.  Cell phones are going off.  And then just, just tall people.  I understand you're tall.  And it's, it's, it's an issue everywhere you go.  But can you just look to see if there is another seat? 
[00:21:30]  I understand if it's packed and there's nowhere else to go.  Can you sit where there's no one behind you?  Can you just look?  Because there have been situations where I've been in the movie theater and someone just sits right in front of you and they're 18 feet tall and block your view.  And if he just moved over one seat, you'd be fine.  Right.  But they just don't even think about it.  They just sit down and then you go.  And you got to get up and move and make a point that he knows you're moving because he got in your way. 
[00:22:00]  Big head.  Sorry.  Sorry I was in your way.  I have a hormone problem.  It was a pituitary gland thing ever since I was a kid.  Yeah, I understand.  All right, Lurch.  Got that big Lurch head.  Excuse me, you mind if I sit here?  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Jaws from the Bond movies.  Wasn't that Lurch too?  They're all Lurch. 
[00:22:30]  Richard Keel.  Richard Keel.  Mr. Keel, could you move over one seat?  I apologize.  You know, my parents didn't even know I had this until I was eight years old.  And then I shot up.  My seventh, here's my picture at seven.  I fit in with everybody.  And then I was eight years old.  And here's my class picture.  I'm bigger than the teacher.  I had what they call a growth spurt.  I hit six foot at eight years old.  Eight years old, I was six foot three.  But, you know, I still tried to do things normal kids did. 
[00:23:00]  I had to go to the, I was the only eight-year-old in the big and tall shop.  Yeah, we understand the trials and tribulations of being the Lurch guy.  Could you get out of my way?  I'm trying to watch a movie.  Too funny.  I'm getting killed, by the way.  Dave and Phoenix.  The iMac, Opie, you effing idiot.  You watched it on a computer.  Can you get a goddamn word right for a change, Grandpa?  Grandpa!  With your iBook. 
[00:23:30]  I'm really tired, man.  I decided it would be good for the show if I checked out Poseidon.  We had a couple of the actors on recently.  Yeah.  Including Richard Dreyfuss.  Richard Dreyfuss.  How was Richard Dreyfuss' performance?  He didn't talk much.  No?  I didn't really talk in the movie.  Hmm.  Interesting.  I don't want to give stuff away, so let's just put it at that for now, okay?  All right.  And then I went home, because I'm trying to prepare for the radio show, and I'm really tired,  and I decide, well, I got an American Idol on DVR. 
[00:24:00]  I'll check that out as well.  So I'll be well prepared for the American Idol chatter that we do every once in a while.  Chatter.  And we'll do that after a little break.  How's that sound?  Okay, tease, Meister.  It doesn't matter.  No, I mean, the American Idol stuff will be quick.  Yeah.  Also, we got some audio on David Blaine.  Tyra Banks was down at the Cafe Waugh last night, right next door to the cellar.  Did you see her?  Nah, Keith Robinson knew her dumb friend.  I really wanted to go over and get a picture, but she had security, and I knew she'd probably 
[00:24:30]  shoo me away.  And I couldn't say Opie and Anthony show.  Big fan.  Yeah, after we'd beaten her up.  Yeah, oh, really fast.  A lot of people from post offices are calling for some reason.  Jeff, from the post office.  Yes, Jeff.  Oh, about the crime you're about to commit today?  Yes, Jeff.  The federal offense with tampering with the mail?  Yes, Jeff.  Yeah, it's up to CBS to forward Howard's mail, and if it's already opened, you might be able  to get away with it, but I just check with legal before you start handing out the mail. 
[00:25:00]  Ben Sparks opened it.  Yeah, Ben did.  Ben does that a lot.  He'll actually go in the mailboxes and open stuff.  Ben, there's a crime going on, and Ben's just pointing at last night's Red Sox Yankees  clips laughing.  Right.  He doesn't care if he's committing a felony.  Ah, Sox.  Ah, 14-3.  Hey, Manny Ramirez.  So we shouldn't hand out Howie mail?  No, I wouldn't if I were you, but check with legal.  You might be able to get away with it.  Yeah, let's do it and see what happens.  There you go.  Yeah, by the way, Stephen from Bayshore, thanks for kind of saving me. 
[00:25:30]  IMAC is the theater in Huntington right near F.H.  Riley's, my brother's restaurant.  Oh!  That I'm part owner of and there all the time.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  Come by and say hi.  That's where you see dying rock stars.  That's where they go.  It's like the tar pit for the Mastodon.  Dying rock bands end up in the IMAC or IMACs.  Huh?  Which one is it in Huntington?  It's IMAC.  It's IMAC in Huntington.  And I've seen that for, who knows, 25 years. 
[00:26:00]  It used to be the 25-cent theater where you used to go see, like...  Laser light shows.  Laser light shows and stuff like that.  And then they turned it into this theater where now, like, you could go see Blue Oyster  Cult play.  And as they're playing, you could carry on a civil conversation in the front row with your  friend, because it's just like, you know, don't fear the reaper, nor do the winner and  the sum.  And it's that volume.  You used to see these guys rocking, and now they're in this small theater where you might 
[00:26:30]  as well be a dinner theater.  Yeah, well.  I went there for the laser light shows.  Oh, those are entertaining for five minutes.  I know, after the first, uh...  Wow, Laser Floyd.  Yeah.  This is great, man.  After the first Floyd song, you're like, uh, uh, are you going to do it all day?  What, are they going to do that laser in the shape of a daisy again?  All right.  It looks just like an Etch-a-Sketch.  God, people are killing me because I'm mispronouncing. 
[00:27:00]  A spirograph.  That's what I meant.  Damn it.  I stink.  Dan from New Hampshire.  In parentheses, it says, the gay state.  Yeah, thanks to Vito.  Vito's really giving New Hampshire a really bad day.  New Hampshire got gay, uh, eating Johnny Cakes.  You can't eat Johnny Cakes if they're gay.  You want a tall or a short stack?  I'll take the...  Oh!  Yeah.  Yeah.  When the chef is pulling the back of your head toward the stack of Johnny Cakes, perhaps 
[00:27:30]  it's time to leave.  You don't eat Johnny Cakes if they're served by a man wearing nothing but a leather vest.  Mustachioed gentleman.  You know, we got some audio of, um...  Johnny Cakes.  We got some audio of David Blaine.  Yeah.  We might play after the break.  And, uh, Dan from New Hampshire, the gay state.  He writes, hopefully the audio of David Blaine is just a gurgling noise.  But he's claiming that his, uh, dumb stunt was a success.  Complete success.  Shower. 
[00:28:00]  All right, we're just getting warmed up.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I love showing my boots to introverted fat guys.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony mornings.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:28:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Godsmack and I Stand Alone.  I, uh, there's an article on Godsmack and, uh, I think it's the news today.  Godsmack takes flack after Navy ads enlist bands songs.  I had no idea, first of all, they're the number one album in the country right now.  It shows you how out of touch I am.  Yeah, we were talking about last week.  Their, uh, their fourth album sold 214,000 copies in the first week.  I, uh, I love these guys and, uh, apparently a couple of their songs are being used by Navy recruiter, uh, ads.  Yeah, there was a campaign going on about a year ago where they would just, uh, start playing a Godsmack song and it was Navy. 
[00:29:00]  See the ships going and shooting things.  Wonderful.  Of course, Sully had to be confronted by this jackass editor of, uh, Billboard magazine, uh, Jay Babcock.  Jay Babcock?  Yes.  Okay.  Jay Babcock, uh.  They certainly must have, uh, teased him in school.  Yeah, well, of course.  Probably just spoke the truth. 
[00:29:30]  Uh, and he, he's like, uh, you don't think, uh, using the power of your music has an effect on people?  He's like, you're proud of recruiting your fans into the military?  Just another liberal douche in music.  Shut your face.  And, of course, uh, Sully said something about the fact that, uh, you're one of these guys that agrees that every time some kid puts a noose around his neck because Judas Priest lyrics told him to.  So, Jay Babcock is dying of fire.  That's all I want to say.  It annoys me.  Jay Babcock, shame, shame on you. 
[00:30:00]  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Of course, you have to confront him.  Yeah, man.  By the way, it's also Whip Him Out Wednesday today.  We got to get that, uh, rolling again.  Yes.  Uh, the brand new WOW stickers for New Yorker, and I don't know if the other cities have their WOW stickers yet.  Mm.  And, of course, uh, the XM Nation, we got the Whip Him Out Wednesday stickers, and every day you see more and more WOW stickers, uh, on cars, on the highways and the streets, all over the joint. 
[00:30:30]  Basically, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  You get the WOW on the car.  Especially on the walk, uh, from here to XM.  Yeah, I know.  They are everywhere.  We're handing out the, uh, brand new WOW stickers that Free FM here in New York, uh, made.  Yeah.  On our walk every morning, so.  Uh, but basically, you throw that on your car, and, uh, it supports the show.  It tells everybody you like Gopi and Anthony, and also, a little extra bonus, there are women out there that will flash you if they see the WOW stickers, the Whip Him Out Wednesday stickers.  Right.  And if you don't have a WOW sticker yet, uh, the homemade WOW signs work very well also, okay? 
[00:31:00]  Scratch it in the dirt on the back of your truck.  There you go.  And we have a WOW, like, uh, WOW sighting hotline and all that stuff that we'll get into in, in coming weeks.  But, uh, just know it's Whip Him Out Wednesday, and your first job is to get a WOW sticker on your car, okay?  Right.  Hey, front page of the New York papers, did you read about the model?  I don't know what this is about.  You, you were sort of telling me, uh.  I was chuckling.  In the office, but it's on the front page of the Daily News, front page of the New York Post. 
[00:31:30]  I guess it was a slow news day, because this is their headline.  Yes.  Stupid model.  Models 40 mile per hour fall from bus, and, uh, the New York Post has models potty plunge.  She's really, uh, busting apart those, uh, stereotypes of models being stupid.  She's on a tour bus.  I guess they're doing some kind of photo shoot, and she's pretty hot and everything.  Uh, she had to go.  She had to go to the bathroom, and, uh, she's on the tour bus, and I guess they're rolling down the, uh, Gowanus Expressway here in New York. 
[00:32:00]  Um, and she went to the bathroom, she gets out, and you either make a left or a right once you step out of the bathroom.  And there's two doors, I guess, to separate the bathroom from the rest of the tour bus, just in case Jim Norton ever has to use that bus.  Uh, so she opened the door and stepped out, and it was the door leaving the bus.  It was the door to the highway.  So she stepped out at 40 miles an hour. 
[00:32:30]  Oh.  For anyone that lives in New York, the most miraculous part of the story is that the bus was able to do 40 on the Gowanus.  You do, like, five miles an hour on that godforsaken road.  Is that what happened to this dummy?  She stepped out.  She stepped out.  She thought she was walking back into the bus, and she stepped onto the highway.  What a dummy.  What a dummy.  A beautiful high-fashion model apparently took a wrong turn inside her trailer's bathroom as the RV rumbled along a Brooklyn highway yesterday and opened up a door that dumped her onto the highway. 
[00:33:00]  Yikes.  Leggy Russian head-turner, name I can't pronounce, 21, suffered a possible broken shoulder and wrist, as well as cuts and bruises when she took the terrifying tumble from the motor.  I don't know what happened.  I opened door, I fall out on street.  Stupid.  Didn't it tip you off that there were other cars and a curb in the middle of the bus aisle?  Idiot.  Just the road rushing by and not a nice carpet. 
[00:33:30]  Dude, did you read the whole story?  No, I was laughing.  The frantic driver of the vehicle spotted the model in his side view mirror as she fell out and really pulled over.  You don't see that every day.  Imagine you're just staring at your side view to see how traffic is rolling along in there.  She's a model rolling down the road.  She's holding a paper with her pants around the ankles.  The Russian model landed in the left lane, which the RV had been traveling in and miraculously wasn't hit by another vehicle. 
[00:34:00]  Lucky her.  Oh, wow.  She wasn't picked up and sexually assaulted.  Yeah, but do you imagine driving along and the next thing you know, there's a Russian girl falling out of a toilet.  Oh, wonderful scene.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  That is a great story, man.  Yeah, dopey model.  Oh, wow.  Let's say hi to Jessie.  She's a girl from Queens.  Jessie, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, Jessie, what are you doing? 
[00:34:30]  Hi.  Hey, I'm getting ready for work.  All right.  Another day, another dollar.  And?  And I wanted to get the tool tickets, so what's up with that?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  See where we started?  We just gave away a pair.  And now?  Now we got a lady and she wants a pair.  You know, where were you last week when we had mousetraps?  I called and, you know, you guys were always busy and I... 
[00:35:00]  What?  Well, what do you look like?  That's what that matters, but I'm just kind of curious.  Are you serious?  No, I'm curious because there's something we're doing.  That's why I'm asking you.  Yeah.  What do you look like, Jessie?  Let's get into this a little bit.  Come on.  Let's start with the height.  5'3".  5'3", okay.  All right.  And, well, I have black hair.  All right.  Black hair.  What color eyes?  Green eyes.  Ooh. 
[00:35:30]  Nice combination.  What nationality?  Indian.  Indian?  Yeah.  What type of Indian?  That's very confusing.  Punjabi.  Punjabi.  Okay.  From India.  Yeah.  Okay.  Basically.  All right.  Really?  All right.  I thought she was American Indian.  No, you said Punjabi, right?  Mm-hmm.  That sounds like American Indian to me.  Yeah, it does.  The Punjabi tribe.  No, no, no.  Punjabi is like...  North Indian.  From the country of India.  Yeah.  Right.  Okay. 
[00:36:00]  You didn't know that.  I did know that.  Of course I did.  My friend Ragu was Indian, and he was the one that said Northern and Kurdans.  Ragu?  Yes.  Some more important questions.  What do you have to wax on your body on a regular basis?  Wax?  Yeah.  As an Indian woman.  Wow.  Mustache?  No.  Oh, you're lucky.  You sure?  Yeah.  I'm not hairy.  Oh, you're not?  A lot of Indian women, we got a lot of hair.  All right.  What do you have to wax on your body? 
[00:36:30]  What's that to wax?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  That's really nice.  Basically wax my legs, if that's the truth.  That's about it?  Yeah, not really well.  All right.  Got a MySpace?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  Everyone does.  How much do you weigh?  125.  125?  5'3"?  Yeah.  Everyone lies by a couple of pounds.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  So does 125 mean 130?  No, it means 125.  Closer to 128.  Well, do you have...  Why don't you get ready to punch it in there?  Maybe we can take a look at the MySpace.  Okay.  How long you been...  What's the MySpace address?  The MySpace address?  Yes.  The MySpace address.  I don't even know.  Hold on.  What the fuck?  Oh, she's going to find a hot girl.  Yeah.  You don't have time to find a hot girl. 
[00:37:30]  Find a hot Indian girl.  That's a little rough.  Right, Jesse.  I don't think that's part of this search engine feature.  Is Jesse...  That's not really a traditional Indian name.  Huh?  Jesse's not a traditional Indian name.  That's just my nickname.  I figured it was.  What's your real name?  Jasmine.  What's that?  Jasmine.  Jasmine.  That's nice.  That's beautiful.  All right.  So are we going to look at our MySpace?  Yeah.  What is it?  MySpace.com slash what?  Hold on.  I'm checking it out.  I don't even know.  You don't even know.  You don't even know her MySpace address? 
[00:38:00]  Because she doesn't have friends.  It's just part of her...  Oh, you got no friends?  You don't have any MySpace.  On your MySpace address?  You're going to.  You're going to.  Why don't you have any friends, Jesse?  I do have friends.  Okay.  All right.  Hurry up.  How old is she?  I'm 18.  18?  You'll have...  Oh, that's going to help.  That helps bring all the numbers that Opie's writing down.  It helps the average.  Yeah.  We're doing the equation.  It helps the 125, which is a little shaky.  Oh.  Where are you looking for this MySpace thing? 
[00:38:30]  Are you just looking through every MySpace account until you hit yours?  Because I'll be honest.  That could take some time.  Get into the J's.  Right.  Well, my name on the MySpace thing is Jesse, so I don't know.  Well, there's probably only one Jesse on MySpace.  Yeah, I'm sure.  You don't know what your MySpace name is.  Oh, I know the URL, if that's what you wanted.  Well, that's what we want.  That's what we want, you dummy.  Don't call her a dummy yet.  Don't call me a dummy.  You don't call her a dummy, y'all.  We're just wasting 10 minutes with you. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  What's the URL?  What is it?  What is it?  www.myspace.com slash 1637-8468.  All right.  We're checking out your MySpace account.  All right.  All tight, Jesse.  Punch this up.  All right.  Anthony is checking out the MySpace page.  And there she is.  Go to more pics.  18.  We'll go to more pics.  Oh, I hate that you've got to log in. 
[00:39:30]  Is that you with the over-the-shoulder look there?  Yeah.  Cool.  The over-the-shoulder look?  Well, no, no, no.  She's kind of standing, like, looking back.  And it goes to my page, which is just wonderful.  I love when that happens.  Unnavigatable.  The over-the-shoulder shot?  Well, no, no, no.  Let's see.  That is used to cover up a world of hurt.  No, no, no.  All right.  Well, there she is.  Wow.  You really seem to stick to your own, huh?  Are there any...  Do you live in India?  No, I don't. 
[00:40:00]  I'm from Queens, man.  Do you have any white friends?  White friends?  Yes.  You do?  Well, how about this?  You don't get to see Tool, and you can bring...  And you bring in a Caucasian, maybe.  What do you think, Jimmy?  I can't see the picture.  Nah, she's cute.  She's all right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I say...  Come on, please.  I say...  What do you think, Jimmy? 
[00:40:30]  How many do we have?  How many do we have, Ben?  Four pairs.  Four pairs.  We gave away one, right?  Yeah.  And we gave away...  What would you be willing to do for Tool tickets?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What do you want me to do?  Ugh.  Hey, why is your headline on there?  I think I'm going to throw up.  Oh, when I wrote my...  When I made my account, I was, like, completely drunk.  So, I don't know.  I guess that's the first thing that came up to me.  So, I don't know.  Oh. 
[00:41:00]  I was hoping you were bulimic.  I like that in a girl.  Is there anything interesting on our MySpace account?  No, there's just all Indian people.  You're 18...  Are you divorced, by the way?  Is that incorrect?  No, it's just supposed to be a joke.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  That was really...  Yeah, yeah.  It's worth a laugh.  What am I going to have to do for the Tool tickets, man?  That's a good question.  We probably should have been prepared for this.  We weren't...  Hold on. 
[00:41:30]  Teresa's going to talk to Jesse.  Teresa.  You cannot give this girl Tool tickets.  You can't.  Why?  I can't listen to her five more seconds.  She sounds like a retard.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I cannot listen to her.  Please.  Jesse, comment.  Well...  Hmm.  You didn't really impress us, I've got to be honest with you.  And you really slowed down the show drastically.  Like, my pressure's going up.  Just listen to her.  You're pissing everybody off.  Yo, listen.  First of all...  Oh, come on.  Let's start an argument. 
[00:42:00]  Hang up the phone.  You don't even know your MySpace address.  If you don't want to listen to my voice, you can just turn off the radio.  Okay, go buy the tool ticket.  No one's forcing you.  Wait, what?  Wait, Jesse, what'd you say?  What was the last sentence?  Huh?  I didn't hear what you said.  What was the last thing you said?  I said if she doesn't want to listen to my voice, you could just turn off the radio.  Okay.  No, because I want to listen to O&A, not your ass.  So you're encouraging our listeners to turn off the show.  That's really going to help.  See, guys?  See, guys?  And you want to give a girl from the tool ticket?  All right.  Thank you, Teresa.  Thank you.  Teresa, obviously from the south shore of Long Island. 
[00:42:30]  Mike, you can't give her those tickets.  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.  I'm from Bayshore.  I think, Jesse, we're going to have to pass.  Why not?  Come on.  Yeah, you really didn't do anything but bring the show to a screeching halt.  Well, what do you want me to do?  I'll do anything.  You will.  How long have you been a tool fan?  Actually, just recently.  Oh, brand new.  What do you say your five favorite tool songs?  Yeah, that's a good question.  Okay, let me see. 
[00:43:00]  Sober, Anima, 42 and 6.  Let me see.  Jerk Off.  And then one more, right?  Yeah, how about some songs that are a little more current?  Although those songs are very fine tool songs.  Very good songs.  I know they're old songs.  I'm not more of these are current songs.  Oh.  So you want to go see Tool as they perform all their new stuff  that you don't know?  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Thank you for nothing. 
[00:43:30]  Hey, really fast.  Wait, wait, thanks for nothing.  You're kidding, man.  Wow.  She's a fun killer.  All right.  That's funny.  Jesse.  Name's Jasmine.  A little short, almost fatso.  Jesse.  That's what they do with the customer service at Dell  or any of the places that you call  and they send you to India now.  And it's like, hello, my name is Robert.  No.  No, it's not.  Your name is not Robert.  Hello, I'm Don.  How may I help you?  You're not Don.  You're not Don.  Stop it.  If I threw my hamburger at you, you'd worship it. 
[00:44:00]  Here we go.  We got some funny audio here.  Howard bitching yesterday.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  I'm pissed that Casino Cinema's got better guests than us.  All of a sudden.  Yeah.  I mean, that show now has Richard Dreyfuss and Kurt Russell.  Kurt Russell and he lost them and Josh Lucas on today.  We can't get those people.  Michael Imperioli this afternoon.  Yeah.  That's great.  From the Sopranos?  From the Sopranos, yeah.  She's got good people.  Bitching that he couldn't get Richard Dreyfuss. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Can't get good guests.  Well, we got Richard Dreyfuss.  Yes, we did.  Because we have many, many, many, many, many more listeners right now than good old Howie.  That must suck.  So he's bitching and complaining because he can't get the good guests because he's not  talking to enough people to get the good guests.  And he pointed out that he can't get Dreyfuss on his show.  Because all of a sudden, it's not about friendship or wanting to be on someone's show like he might  have thought.  It's all business.  It's about numbers.  It's about how many people you have listening to you. 
[00:45:00]  There you go.  So, as we go to break, a little clip, a little taste of our interview with Richard Dreyfuss  yesterday.  Well, now, a couple of popular movies that you've been in, sir.  Yes.  Just a couple I can like.  Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind.  Right, right.  Debbie does Dallas.  You look very good for your age.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  He's got the radio voice again.  Yeah, he's doing that radio voice.  And, of course, my favorite, your appearance on Bewitched, which every so often turns out. 
[00:45:30]  I mean, you missed the Jewish gun smoke that I did?  Now, that I didn't see.  Yes, I said the prayer for the dead on the prairie.  Really?  Really?  Yes, I was a Yiddish immigrant.  How old were you in that?  Because that had to be...  I don't know.  It was about 18, 17.  Really?  I was doing all that stuff.  Mod Squad.  I was a mother killer on Mod Squad.  All those old great shows.  Mannix.  Did you ever do a Mannix?  I didn't do a Mannix. 
[00:46:00]  I played Yossarian in the TV pilot of Catch-22.  Really?  Yeah.  That was amazing.  And I also did a pre-runner to All in the Family called Peace in the Family, which was crap.  Didn't quite take off like the other one.  I will do you with Mount Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekday mornings.  Weekday mornings.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:46:30]  1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Make sure you get your WOW stickers.  We'll have some system in place for all the new listeners.  Hopefully we'll have that info in the near future, okay?  Yes.  I know we hand out the WOW stickers here in New York every day when we walk from here to there.  Hand them out.  Slap them on moving vehicles.  Whatever works.  Whatever works.  Right.  Guerrilla tactics.  We got to get the energy back in the show. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, no more calls from Indian girls.  Jesse, man, come on.  If you call the show, you got to get right into it.  This show moves by really, really fast.  We only do like three hours of radio the first half here.  Yeah.  And then the second half we do another two and a half, but we got to get right into things.  No dilly-dallying.  That's right.  What else is going on?  I guess you heard the news.  Britney Spears pregnant again.  Really?  You got to ask why.  She really wants to ravage that body. 
[00:47:30]  Why, why, why?  She just wants to ravage it.  Her relationship stinks.  It's pretty obvious.  Yeah.  I don't think she's very happy.  Disagree.  That guy's good, man.  I love his music.  Yeah, you like his tunes?  Really good.  Kevin Federline, yeah.  They're all talking about how it's just a horrible relationship and stuff, and if you  believe half of what you read, you know, that relationship's going to end in divorce, and  what does she do?  She'll have a couple of kids.  She F's up the moneymaker.  It's all about her body. 
[00:48:00]  About that ace.  And then she'll...  Just giving Jessica Simpson the title.  Yeah.  Jessica Simpson, you know, she's not getting pregnant anytime soon, because she knows her  body is what's selling her music.  That's what they're coming to see, going to the movies for, her concerts, and then what's  Britney going to get out there with that ass and the gut?  And her lasagna belly.  Oh, stretch marks.  Hit me, baby, one more time.  Uh, no thank you. 
[00:48:30]  Um, no.  No, I don't think so.  Stretchy pants with her bunt.  But she's pregnant, and she's very excited about that, so good luck to good old Britney  Spears.  Come out and sing with that thing that holds the baby in front of her, and one on her back.  Papoose.  That's sexy.  Kevin doing any gigs, man?  I want to get some Kevin Federline tickets to go check out that music.  You're a liar.  That guy's good.  You can't be that ill.  I like him.  And Britney thinks it's all about, you know, her voice and stuff.  Yeah.  You know, she's delusional. 
[00:49:00]  There's a lot of people that were into Britney Spears, including men in their 30s.  Scandalous.  Yeah, she used to do a show, because her voice stinks.  So she would just pretty much do a show in some skin-colored leotard, so she'd look naked  in a bathtub, and then simulate sex with a black guy on a bed.  It was like a big production number.  Yeah.  And, you know, her singing was secondary, because it was pretty much all recorded. 
[00:49:30]  She'd have a headset mic on that probably wasn't on.  And she would jump around on the stage and do, like, sexual moves.  And that was it.  With a black fellow?  Yeah, yeah.  Good thing she didn't get pregnant.  He'd, like, faux, do some faux hump thing.  And it was really, well, it was kind of hot to watch.  It was on HBO a while ago.  So, and then now, she's not going to be able to do that.  She can't sing.  So, yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Good luck to you.  Good luck.  Second pregnancy in, what, 13 months or something crazy like that?  God spade, Britney.  God spade.  Whatever.  American Idol last night, really fast.  Catherine McPhee going home.  Bye-bye.  She's done-ski.  Because, I don't know, Paul Abdul just put that Elliot kid over.  Elliot's got no personality.  Everyone forgets he's even on the show.  But he's going to go to the top three now.  Yeah.  He's going to the semifinals.  Catherine McPhee effed it up last night. 
[00:50:30]  And it looks like she's going home.  And everyone loves Taylor.  Taylor Hicks.  What's wrong with Taylor Hicks?  I don't know.  I'm pretty done with him.  Soul Patrol, bro.  Soul Patrol.  The gimmick.  It's done.  It's done.  Did you hear him sing In the Ghetto?  Yes, I did.  You didn't like it?  In the Ghetto.  Oh, how was it?  That's a good song by Elvis.  They did Elvis songs last night.  Oh.  All Elvis songs.  Tommy Mottola helping him out at Graceland, putting the songs together.  And then they came out and sang them.  By the way, Tommy Mottola definitely holding a grudge. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Because they introduced Tommy Mottola on American Idol last night and all the artists that he helped and made huge.  Yeah.  And they did not mention Mariah Carey.  His hug is fined.  Oops.  Talked about Destiny's Child and the rest of them that he discovered.  Yeah.  But no Mariah Carey mentioned last night.  No.  No, a little bit of a problem there.  I think he's a little bitter.  But yeah, he helped him with the arrangements of the songs and stuff.  And then he went out and sang.  Here's a taste of Taylor Hicks last night on American Idol. 
[00:51:30]  As the snow flies  On a cold and gray Chicago moor  Another little baby child is born in a ghetto  Not bad.  It's a good version.  Yeah.  And his mama cries  Cause if there's one thing that she don't need 
[00:52:00]  It's another little hungry mouth  Stop having kids  Social commentary  Down near the head  Help in the head  Oh, he'll run to be a very old man someday  Well, take a look at you and me  Oh, we should burn and see  Simply do we turn our heads  And move the other way 
[00:52:30]  As the world  Turned  Well, you get the idea.  Taylor Hicks doing a great job with In the Ghetto.  At least it wasn't one of his, you know, over-the-top  kind of wacky dancing and twitching songs.  Come on, man.  He makes it fun.  Yeah, but the guy, you kind of underestimate his voice.  He does have a very good voice  When he's jumping around like that  Being a retard  What were the other Elvis songs that they sang? 
[00:53:00]  Chris Daughtry did  Suspicious Minds  Catherine McPhee  Just did a horrendous job with Hound Dog  Butchered Hound Dog  Why would you do Hound Dog?  Do you want to hear just a quick piece?  All right.  By the way, Captain Obvious on the phone  F-Sauce  F-Sauce, what do you got for the show?  Hey, the reason Tommy Mottola didn't mention Mariah there  Was because it was a stipulation up there about divorce  Oh, really?  Yeah  Oh  I also want to say that  All right, then I apologize  Because I thought you were just going to say 
[00:53:30]  He didn't mention Mariah Carey because he divorced her  But if it was a stipulation in the divorce  Then that would be  That's totally different  That would be some info that we did not know  Hey, Jimmy, what time are you going on Friday night?  I want to get a picture in the men's room with you  I think it's an 8 o'clock show  Friday night in Boston, right?  At the Orpheum  At the Orpheum  With David Tell  And now Keith Robinson is part of that show  That's a great show  Multicultural  So what time are you going on, Jim?  I want a picture in the men's room  I know  We got it  It's an 8 o'clock show, sir  That's why I was saying that probably 
[00:54:00]  I'm going on second on that show  Third, actually  And then  Right  All right  Hey, uh  I'm in the men's room, Jim  Well, I'm not sure what you mean  The picture in the men's room  I want a picture before you go on stage  We get it  With the show's at 8 o'clock  Where should we take the picture?  Out  Thank you  The listeners get one more chance today  One more chance  One more chance  They really have  They stink today  Elliot looks like a monkey 
[00:54:30]  Someone is saying  On the instant feedback  That's not nice  And then someone writes  Why is Britt pregnant again?  Because K-Fed is a genius  Find a bitch with $125 million  And lock that pussy up  Jesus  Can you say that?  I don't even know  I don't think so  K-Fed  K-Fed is a genius  K-Fed  Find a bitch with $125 million  And then, you know  Wait  And then wreck that 
[00:55:00]  You know what  Did he call himself K-Fed?  Yes  Yeah, he made up his own little name  No, I don't believe that  Yes, he did  Yeah, and he's got music on everything  For Papa Zola  That's kind of catchy  He's got to be  Yeah, it is  He needs street cred  So you come up with those names  K-Fed  Who says K-Fed?  He does  And he tells everyone that's his name  How about this?  K-Fed  Another man who's junk  I'm going to call you J-Nor  Well, I'm  No, J-Rock is my nickname 
[00:55:30]  But what about E-Rock?  I don't care  He's like a  He's a wannabe  Jesus  K-Fed  I hope Soda County has finally laughed this morning  I guess we're doing well now  Everyone digs me  So I want to be a-hole  No?  That's not cool?  That kind of works  Yeah  Catherine McPhee  Butchering Hound Dog  Just a taste  You ain't nothing but a hound dog 
[00:56:00]  Crying all the time  You ain't nothing but a hound dog  Crying all the time  You ain't never caught a rabbit  And you ain't no friend of mine  Well, you said you want hot cats  That was just a lie  Yeah, you said you want hot cats  That was just a lie  It's like a high school musical  Oh  You ain't never caught a rabbit  Feel to it, right?  It sounds okay, but it's just like, who cares? 
[00:56:30]  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had  And I've had them all over the world  I'm eating like a girl on a fuzzy tree  My friends say I'm acting  What is a bug?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Boring  It's over, Jenny  It's over, Jenny  It's over, Jenny  Boring  That's too bad  Because Tommy Mottola said that he was very, very impressed by her 
[00:57:00]  Do you use your tongue prettier and a $20 whore?  Tommy Mottola was just ranting and raving about Catherine McPhee  And I couldn't help but think  He just wants to do her  Of course  He just wants to do her  Then again, he's Tommy Mottola  I mean, all he probably does is bang hot chicks  Yeah  All the time  All right  You know any dumb strippers he has to deal with?  I sing too  Really, do you?  Singing to the microphone, honey  Just jiggle those while you sing 
[00:57:30]  That a girl  And finally, just a taste of Chris Daughtry doing Suspicious Minds  Yes  I don't know this song  The guy that's going to win the whole thing, by the way  We've known that he's going to win this thing for, what?  Months now  Yeah  Months  Obvious  No one has beaten this kid  It's a great song  Lord and a child  I can't walk out  Because I love you too much, baby 
[00:58:00]  Why can't you see  What you're doing to me  Well, you don't believe a word I say  Bring it on home  We can go on together  With suspicious minds  With suspicious minds  And we can build our dreams 
[00:58:30]  With suspicious minds  Oh, let our love survive  Watch my tears from your eyes  Let's don't let a good thing die  Because, honey, you know I'll never lie to you  Well, you got the feel for it  Not his best performance on American Idol 
[00:59:00]  No  He's got great range  Good control  He's got personality  You think Elvis wrote suspicious minds  After he realized it was a third degree black belt  Leaving a map of Hawaii  And Priscilla's hair  Oh  By the way, what's going on with Priscilla?  A little too much plastic surgery  Botox  A little too much  Ah, yeah, the Botox  Yeah  She got the duck bill lips going  Her face is kind of frozen in time  A little swollen and frozen, yeah  She was really, really creepy  Oof  You know  It worked for many, many years 
[00:59:30]  I mean, because Elvis has been dead, what, 30 years now?  Yeah, she's no kid  And I know she was young when they were going out  But how old is  She's got to be, what, now?  In her 60s?  Early 60s?  Really?  That old?  I don't know  You gotta think  55 at least  Was she still in her 20s when Elvis died?  Oh, I forgot  When did they get married?  In the 60s?  I don't know  Let's see  We don't know her  None of us know anything  Born in 1945  45, so she was  61  61  61  61 
[01:00:00]  Looking like she's  I don't know  30  35  With a frozen face  Yeah  Just  It was all like  Big and bloated  Yeah  And her lips were  Yeah  She had  These duck bill lips going  No, no  Was she at American Idol?  Like  Yeah, at Graceland  They all went to Graceland  To practice their songs  And that whole collagen thing  In the lips, girls  Ladies, women 
[01:00:30]  Cougars  Whatever you want to call you  It's not working  Doesn't look natural  Just face it  Your lips are getting thinner  I like it, though  Do you really?  Compared to thin old lady lips  Yeah  Well, there's a middle ground  There somewhere  Probably right  I'll take collagen  Over that stupid  What genetics  And then time  Does to your face  So the lipstick  Wicks up in little lines  I like the fact that  After they get all that  Botox  You can't see any expressions  It's exactly what I want 
[01:01:00]  Just a blank  Dumb look on your face  I got a communique  From Club Soda Kenny  I'm turning  Turning on the mic  Uh oh  He has a lot of confidence  In this  Yes, Club Soda Kenny  Our lips are good  Soup coolers  How's that?  Horrid  And you know what's  Even more revolting  Than his delivery on that 
[01:01:30]  Was the fact that  Like a Zoo Crew jack-off  I went, uh oh  Yeah  Like when he's walking over  Like, here comes  Some trouble, folks  Watch out  Uh oh  Like, you know how  On Zoo Crews  Always has to be  That little noise  And snappy patter  Oh no  Here he comes again  Thinking he's gonna be funny  Uh oh  That was what I just did  Instead of just  Shutting my mouth  Until he got there  Oh man  Fill that  Fill that silence  Uh oh  Pull over, folks  Here it comes  Can't be any dead air  This is the  Trouble Bruin section 
[01:02:00]  Ugh  Really fast  Before we take another break  We gotta talk about  The bear in Jersey  There's a bear loose in Jersey  Have we found the bear yet?  No, they have aerial shots of him  And I don't know  I saw some cops  Out with guns  Apparently they're gonna shoot him  Well that's what you gotta do  If he  Cause he's entered the no bear zone  Right  Like he's supposed to know  Right  That he's not supposed to be there  At this point  Bears have an area of what  A couple acres to live in  A couple acres of woods  And if they wander out of that  Couple of acres 
[01:02:30]  It's his fault  And he has to die  I just love the mentality  And I'm not one of these  Animal rights activists  By any means  But I always find how  Find it ridiculous  That a bear wanders  Into someone's backyard  And nine out of ten times  They gotta shoot the bear  Yeah  Sometimes they tranquilize  The little fella  Drag him off somewhere  And let him loose  Somewhere else  But in general  They gotta kill the animal  Yellowstone  I love the animals  That get killed  Because they're in a zoo  Yeah  Behind bars  Uh huh 
[01:03:00]  And then some stupid  Person will reach  Through the bars  Or get too close  With their coat  Remember the famous  The polar bear  I think it was  That grabbed the lady's coat  And she couldn't move  Hung on to her  Right  So then  Finally the bear  Let's loose  Most of the time  And then they have to  Kill the animal  Like it doesn't make  Any sense to me  Whatsoever  They're just doing  What they're supposed to do  Yeah  They make nice drugs  Anyway  Some interesting audio  From the news last night 
[01:03:30]  Right now  Police are on the lookout  For this guy  This bear  That paid a visit  To the backyards  Of some New Jersey homes  Today  Hello  The black bear  Managed to escape  Into the woods  And that has some  Families in Livingston  Very nervous  I was to support  Jeff Pegase  Is in Livingston now  With the latest  On the search  Jeff  Any luck  Do they find him  Well they still  Haven't found that  Backyard bear  As you call him  He was last seen  We're told by police  Here in Livingston  In this neighborhood  We're in the  Bel Air section  And so this morning  After hearing reports 
[01:04:00]  Of this bear  Being in this area  Police  Animal control  Officials descended  On this neighborhood  With their tranquilizer guns  But through the day  This backyard bear  Proved to be elusive  And officials were never  Able to get close enough  To subdue the animal  Uh oh  That could be a problem  They should just  Let the bear  Live amongst the people  Well I'm sure  They don't like  To shoot the animal  But in fairness  To them  I mean  It's like the bear  Understands reason  It's like they could say  Hey get out of the yard 
[01:04:30]  And he'll go  Oh alright  Don't come back you  All he does is roar  But we just keep  Building building  Closer to their habitat  You know  And then these people  Decide they want to live  You know in these areas  But then the bear  Wanders into their yard  And  And now they want it  Taken care of  No no no no  Do you see grizzly man  They don't exactly  Show a lot of gratitude  For conservationist efforts  Yeah  For people being kind to them  But how nice you are to them  They'll still eat you  If there's no berries  I am concerned  I have a young child

[01:05:30]  In the fence  This guy was really  Trying to get  From here to there  A visit from the bear  And he went right  To our friends  I told my wife  I said all he had to do  Is just lift the latch up  And walk in  Residents first spotted a bear  At around 5.30 this morning  No one knows  Just pressing the alarm code  And he's in my house  The path he took  Brought him dangerously  Close to Livingston's  Business district  And the high school  Kids are getting a little  Antsy  There's like emergency around  It's kind of the feeling  Shut up  200 pound bear  Does it have AIDS?

She's an old broad  Unless she said something else  That's a tough one to see  Right  She's a little desperate  And at her home  What are you gonna do 
[01:07:30]  What are you gonna do  If the bear  Comes after you, Al?  You gotta throw your diapers  At us  A lot of folks here  Taking this situation  In stride  In fact  Police tell us  They don't really believe  That this backyard bear  Poses any serious threat  To the residents  Who live in these areas  What they're hoping for  Police  Is that  Someone will see  The bear  Stay away  And call the professionals  In  What they think happened  Shut up  Is that the bear

I'm so upset about the bear situation 
[01:16:30]  With those idiots in New Jersey  Why are you upset?  Why?  It's a baby bear  What would these idiots do  If they were living in Vermont  When the bears are sitting on the porch with them?  They're probably gonna wind up killing it  Yeah  Yeah, there was a news report  That they're closing in on the bear  And they've decided they just gotta kill it  Oh man  They're actually, there's live coverage  You can see him scampering through a backyard  And um  It's kinda weird 
[01:17:00]  Cause it looks like he's crying for uh  For his mama  His mommy  He's, well they did say he is a cub  He's a baby  Oh yeah  Yeah, but uh  The footage I'm seeing  It doesn't look good for the bear  There's a  Close up on his face  You can just see his eyes  They're all watery  There's three or four really fat guys  With big beer bellies and guns  They got uniforms on  So they gotta be official  Yeah  And they're chasing the little bear  Into a backyard as we speak  Oh this is sad  And the reporter's saying that  The bear is crying  Or or or uh 
[01:17:30]  Or you know  Sounding like it's crying  So why don't they just bring it to a refuge?  They think it's gonna cost too much money  So they think the cheapest way to do it  Is just to shoot it  Yeah, they don't have time  Because uh  I guess uh  They're building a lot of uh  New homes in that area  So they build new homes in New York?  Oh my god  Oh god  They're cornering it right now  Oh  And it looks like he's injured already  Yeah, he's limping  He's limping  Um  What Ben?  Yeah  Are you kidding? 
[01:18:00]  Uh  I guess the bear  Got caught in like a  A bear trap that they uh  Set down  And uh  Yes  It's true Anthony  The left uh  Back leg  Yeah  Is uh  Very injured  So now the bear is kinda  Looks like he chewed it off  To get out of the trap  Kind of uh  Limping along with the uh  With the uh  The guys uh  Following with the  The shotguns  That's sad  Aw  That's really sad  Isn't it?  I'm telling you  I mean  I go to Vermont a lot  And we see  Six foot bears  Sitting on the porches with people 
[01:18:30]  Johnny Kicks  These bears walk into people's houses  Oh my god  Oh  There it is  There it is  There it is  Oh my god  I'm gonna puke  Aw  Aw  Aw  That isn't right  They should do that to the illegal immigrants  That isn't right  That's no good  That's sad  Yeah it is  He's laying there  He's been shot  Aw  The bear's been uh  The bear's been shot  Um  He's trying to get up  That's sad  He's struggling  He's struggling to his  Oh god  Oh the second shot  It's uh  Holy crap 
[01:19:00]  Wow  Wow  You ever see your head  Come apart like that  Yeah  That's kind of cruel  Yeah it is kind of cruel  Oh my god  Denise  What?  They shot the bear once  The bear was limping along right  They shot it once  And uh  And it went down  And then it was trying to struggle  Struggle to his feet  Struggle to his feet  Like he's struggling  All he wanted to do was live  He just wanted to live  And then uh  And then the head shot  Yeah  Aw  That pretty much ended it 
[01:19:30]  But why are they so afraid of a baby bear  It's not being afraid of it  No no it's not being afraid of it  It's just the bottom line  Is to bring it back where it had to be  There was like a whole bunch of like  Charges that they would have to incur  And it's just cheaper to kill it  Yeah  It's cheaper to kill it  But you know what  I mean  Now the mother bear's gonna come looking  And  Well they're dragging it out of the backyard  Yeah  Some Sicilian vendetta  They're dragging it out  They're just dragging it out of the backyard now  With some chains or something  It looks like  Aw  By its feet  So  Alright well  So much for the bear in Jersey  It's over 
[01:20:00]  I'm not here  Whatever  Alright guys  Thanks a lot  Alright good  Sorry well  But there  It's so weird that you called  Just as  They're showing us on live TV  You know  It's so sad  Now they're gonna need a knife  Cause his  What do they call that  His paw  Hoof  Hoof  It's caught in a grill  It's a sin  Aw  Well I just wanna say  I listen to you guys all the time  And use the funny anyway  Thank you  What do you like about the show Denise  What do I like  Dolt  In other news 
[01:20:30]  Is that true by the way  What  Our own Master Poe was eagerly looking for the TV coverage  Are you kidding me  No he wasn't  Are you kidding me  Yeah  Let's see if he found it  Yeah  You're kidding right  No  No  Well no no maybe he found it  Another person you dicks  He actually had me scanning TV channels  Master Poe  What channel  Did you find it  Yeah what channel was it on 
[01:21:00]  No I didn't find it  I don't know  How to use that television  Yeah  You didn't see what we just saw  No  I didn't  Wow  It was disgusting  I know they're not gonna replay it  Because it was too graphic  I'm glad I didn't see it  It was awful dude  I love animals  I'm glad I didn't see it  I'm not like a vegetarian  But I like them too  It really annoyed me  Well they went to commercial  What channel could he watch the rest of the coverage  They'll never replay that  It was too graphic  No  Yeah  It's a stupid animal  They don't do it on replay  Usually there's a delay  As they were going to commercial  They were dragging it out of the backyard 
[01:21:30]  Oh my god  With some kind of apparatus  That looked like chains  Chains yeah  He got  Well he got  Originally he was caught  It's kind of a stupid trap  And then  It was like kind of cornered  They could have done something  They could have darted it  But they just shot it  Which was unnecessary  So  First shot didn't really hit the mark  It kind of suffered a little  And then the money shot  Right in the head  It's a cub  It was so stupid  It's apparently expensive  To bring it somewhere  I don't understand it  But that's what they did  What was sick is when they injured it  And the damn thing was trying to stand up 
[01:22:00]  And all it wanted was  It's mommy  It's mommy  All you gotta do there is dart it  You don't have to kill it  Just wanted mommy  Shot at the side  And then the face  Which is completely unnecessary  So close to Mother's Day  Alright  Just wanted it's mommy  You're alright Master Poe  I'm good  Alright  Thanks guys  Alright  There it goes  Alright  Master Poe everybody  Hey back in a flash  My dear sweet Jesus  Oh my dear sweet Jesus  Oh man 
[01:22:30]  I'm amazed on a daily basis  Back in a flash Anthony  From the New York Post today  The subway flasher  Who harassed a teenage girl in March  Has been caught with his pants down again  And his second victim  Like the first  Exposed the perv  By snapping a picture of him  With her cell phone camera  Everyone's got the camera phones  You can't  You can't get away with this anymore  You can't be flashing your junk out there  Believe me  It's tough  These are tech  This is technology used for a good thing  Like perverted justice  The computer  Where they're getting these pedophiles 
[01:23:00]  And these creeps  This is what you should use technology  I call them buddinskis  If I may use the term  Bunch of goody two shoes  Killjoy  You know  Can't even wave your hog at a stranger  Why?  What's wrong with being friendly?  I  You know  But then again  Women have backed me up on this point  I think it's just silly  You know  I don't think women are actually  And some think I'm crazy  But others did come to my defense 
[01:23:30]  You know  When a guy flashes you  Like on a subway  And he obviously isn't threatening  And he's not going after you  Yeah  Like how many would lead  To an actual sexual assault?  A lot of women have called  And said  Yes  It just looks ridiculous  And silly  Silly  Silly  I know this is something that  It's kind of touchy  As far as women goes  I understand that  But  You know  A guy whips out his hog  On the subway  And he's just doing what he's doing  Yeah  Most women say 
[01:24:00]  They just kind of laugh at him  They laugh  A lot of women  Especially in New York City  Here on the subways  It's a daily  Weekly event  Unless you're alone  It's probably creepy  If you're alone  Yeah  Then it's scary  By the way  David Blaine is on  Good Morning America  And he's trying to show  That his hands are all damaged  But they're not damaged  The report goes  That he was in the hospital  For like  Maybe an hour  After that dumb stunt  He got waterlogged  Look  Now they're fine  And now they're completely fine  Wow  A miracle cure  Yeah  Those big fingernails too  It's called being out of the water 
[01:24:30]  For a couple of hours  It's a new cure  It's called a towel  The ratings were awful  For the show  So hopefully that's the end  Of David Blaine  And his dumb ideas  Were they bad?  No one watched it?  It was  Because the payoff wasn't that good  It's like one of those  Geraldo things he used to do  The Al Capone's vault  That's what he did  He did an Al Capone's vault  Kind of thing  Where now everybody  For any future thing  Is going to be like  Right right  Was it ABC?  Yeah  They stink  Yeah ABC  Steven in New Jersey  Steven  Hey 
[01:25:00]  What do you say Steve?  I was wondering  If we could dedicate  Steven Lynch's  Special Ed  To Master Poe  Today  All right  Thank you  Brian of Brooklyn  Brian  You should have set him free  Hey  How you doing now  I worked in  The precinct  That covered  Prospect Park  Down in 1988  When the police  Had to shoot a polar bear  At the Prospect Park Zoo  And they must have received  Thousands of death threats  To the officers  Who wound up having to kill 
[01:25:30]  That polar bear  I can only imagine  What's going to go on  In New Jersey  Well  Why?  Because they just killed  That bear?  Well I know  They didn't kill that bear  All right  I was sure  But they have to kill that bear  I was like  Do we have another sucker  On the line  To have fun with?  Another one on the line  A polar bear is actually  A brutal bear though  I mean polar bears are vicious  They're so pretty  They are  They're white  That's why  Pretty and white  They're white and well behaved  Friendly  All right  Back to the flash  On the subway  Police believe that  The Hispanic 30-something man  Is targeting young Asian women 
[01:26:00]  Both of his victims  Have reacted quickly  And fought back  Providing cops  With snapshots  Of the 5 foot 9  170 pound perv  I was shocked  And then I got disgusted  The first victim  Oh oops  15  Told the post  Now there's a problem  Now there's a problem  Yeah  Now my theory is out the window  He doesn't have a cell phone  If you're going to  Explose yourself  Yeah  You know  Keep the girls of age  The latest victim  A 22 year old woman  Was traveling on the number 7 train  At 9.45pm Friday 
[01:26:30]  With her mom and a friend  When the sicko struck  At the Junction Boulevard station  My mother suggested  I take a picture of him  The victim said  Adding that  As she held up the phone camera  She confronted the perv  I said  Sir  Your penis is out  Is that a direct quote?  Yes  Wow  And I continue to say that  Louder and louder  I think he knew  I wanted everyone  On the train to hear  I told him  I was sending the picture  To cops and the media  You know how many times 
[01:27:00]  Do you have to yell that  At Jimmy  Every day  Here in the studio  Sir  In the bathroom  Everywhere  Horrible  How embarrassing though  Are you just trying to  Show your hog  To somebody with their mother  And all of a sudden  They're going to call you out loudly  He's probably putting your leg  Oh no no it's not anymore  No no hey  It's not your mom  It looks like your sister  To compliment everybody  To make everything better  Well there's the latest  Nice ball haircut  All three of you have  There's the latest subway perv  And finally 
[01:27:30]  Gotta watch with your cell phones  Yeah  Everything that happens now  Is on camera  Don't  Don't think you could do  Anything out there  And there won't be  A camera showing it  Hey this is a story  In the New York Post  I hope I can read this  Probably  Sex on the rise  For young adults  Yeah this is a survey  That's come out  Every so often  They survey  Women  Between various ages 
[01:28:00]  And determine  How much sexual activity  Is going on  Whether it's increased  Or decreased  Different types  Of sexual activities  Whether it's increased  Or decreased  And apparently  There's been an increase  In a certain type of sex  And some fine sexual activities  There has been an increase  In the past decade  There has been  A significant increase  Significant  Significant increase  Increase  In the proportion of teens 
[01:28:30]  And young adults  Having  Oral  And  Well there's only  One other one  That isn't just  The normal type of sex  Figure it out  See  It doesn't have to be  It's in the post  It doesn't matter  It's a news story  I don't think you can  You can  Let's try  Let's try  Give it a try  I'm reading word for word  Here from the New York Post  In the past decade  There has been  A significant increase 
[01:29:00]  In the proportion of teens  And young adults  Having oral  And  Anal  Sex  Researchers said  Researchers said  Researchers said  Right  Yeah  And  It rose  From 3%  To 5.5%  When it gets to 10  Cell  That's a significant increase  Well that's because  What's happening  Is there's probably  A way to avoid pregnancy  And the church said  Look  Probably  You know anything about biology 
[01:29:30]  It's probably  You know I'm going out on a limb here  But I think  That method  I don't think a girl could get pregnant that way  You'd be surprised  No  You'd be surprised  Well maybe certain  Like  Position afterwards  Yeah exactly  And then some type of  Okay  Well  Don't do a headstand yet  Right  Don't  Don't roll around on the bed  No  Stop  How many people  Have gotten pregnant  That way  One 
[01:30:00]  Because of  One dope  Some type of  Migration  That is being made  By the vital seed  Of  Around the corner  I'll  See you guys later  I'm just headed  Around the corner  I'm going to go this way  The egg runs  It's all dirty  Get out of here  Yeah that's like a bum  Showing up  It's the mac of seed  Hey man  What's up  Oh no  Where have you been  Are you  Get that out of your mouth  You don't know where it's been  Please tell me 
[01:30:30]  You were just tanning  That is horrible  But what a great stat  And I guess  Yeah  That  That's gone up  That was always  Such a taboo  When I was  Growing up  When I was  Going to high school  That was like  Both of those  Activities  Were  You know  You would get  Regular sex  Before you ever  Dreamed  Of getting  Of getting  Those two  Activities  That's for sure 
[01:31:00]  Right  Jimmy  I got nothing  You don't know  No  Yeah you're kind of a  Sick pervert anyway  I was more the normal  Kind of  Get the girlfriend  Guy  Thing like that  You know  Have some type of  Relationship going  Very rare  That there was  Those  One night stand  Things  But  Usually if you  Were  You know  You're a teen  You're going to  High school  You'd go to  The parents house  Pick up the girl  Things like that  You were 
[01:31:30]  You could get  Some regular action  But anything like that  Was going to take  Some Bacardi 151  Or something  I just had  It was very rare  But now  Girls  Apparently  Giving it away  By the way  Chris from Queens  Nope  The effers dumped  Oh  Did they  I thought they would  Why  They dumped  It's just  The way of the world  This day  You're reading  The effing newspaper  If it's okay  For the goddamn post  That S-rag 
[01:32:00]  How can it  How can it  Be okay for you  Because that's the news  They are allowed  A certain  Certain liberties  I think people  Know what we're talking about  They know what we're talking about  Where else  Alright  The ear  Before we go to break  Between the toes  Yeah we're talking about  The asshole  Jimmy  Oh my god  Well  You know what  Oh yes we are Jimmy  I  I shake  When I think  How alert  Al Dukes 
[01:32:30]  Has to be  My god man  Yes  That's what we were  Talking about Jimmy  Yes we were Jimmy  And you're that  As well  Oh my goodness  Can we just  Hold on to this gig  For a week  Or two  Or three  Just a little  While longer  Alright let's  Move on to something  Slightly safer  David Blaine  Before we  Put this dumb thing  To rest  Or to bed  Or whatever  What does David Blaine  Prefer  They 
[01:33:00]  They  They think it was  A success  Well they're  They're calling it  A success  Yes  Although it ended  In a blackout  A loss of motor control  And us performing  A rescue on him  I'd still say  It was a success  David Blaine's  Week long adventure  In that larger than life  Fistball  Was captivating  It was also taxing  He experienced  Liver and kidney damage  He was dehydrated  He was rescued  From the tank  And whisked off 
[01:33:30]  To St. Luke's  Roosevelt Hospital  After being given  An IV  David checked himself  Out of the hospital  At about 3 this morning  And is now home  He's still weak  But he's able  To tolerate food  And he's eating  And he's in a stable condition  And his skin  Which had looked like this  Nearly back to normal now  Of course  He was playing with cards today  A good sign  That the magic is back  Can we remind everybody  Also that on the same day  He did this  Miners were rescued 
[01:34:00]  After 14 days  Caught under rocks  Under like 300 yards  Of rock  They lived through that  And were brought up  And rescued  Yeah where's their  Hyped up special  Yeah where's their  Special  Where's their  Hyped up special  David Blaine  Caught in a mine  No  He'll probably  Try that next  But by the way  All that stuff  They said happened to him  He didn't have any  Irreversible damage  Of course not  You know his liver numbers 
[01:34:30]  And all that went down  Dehydration you could cure  The pruny hands  Just stay out of the water  For a few hours  Today's show sucks  Good morning America  Sucks  The miners  That's an interesting story  14 days  Not just  14 days under rock  How does that happen  Like even though  You're getting supplies  Because they did tunnel  A little hole  That they could put food  Through and water  So they knew  They were going to have  The essentials  And it was just a matter  Of time before  They were able to tunnel in  And get them  But the claustrophobia 
[01:35:00]  You must feel  In a cage  I saw a computer graphic  Of the dimensions  Of what they were in  They were in a cage  That was crushed  By falling rock  They happened to be  In this cage  Very small  They had to be  Crouched down  In this thing  14 days like that  Oof  Now that's  A survival  Instinct  Kicking in  That's not a trick  Or some gag  Those guys  That's some set 
[01:35:30]  Yeah that's the real deal  Not just lose your mind  Down there  And come out  Just going  Cuckoo  Cuckoo  Totally lose it  Here's every  Every conversation  How you doing  Cramped  Ow  Just need to stretch  How could I be doing  You asked me that  Three minutes ago  Yeah  Today's news conference  Was held at the  New York Public Library  For Performing Arts  Which features  A mini exhibit of David  Also known as  Baby Houdini  David is also  The spokesperson 
[01:36:00]  For the library's  Summer reading program  For kids  Perhaps he'll take  A little time off  To read and rest  But don't hold your breath  The medical community  Has plans for David  What we are planning  To do  If he recovers  Completely  Is to bring him  To a controlled  Scientific environment  And that may involve  Holding his breath  But without trying  To pull off an escape  Those shackles  May have been  What held David  Back from his goal  Of a nine minute  Breath hold  But he still managed  More than seven minutes 
[01:36:30]  A feat on its own  What you saw yesterday  I would characterize  As a great success  No it wasn't  And finally  The newscasters  Improvise  It's a short clip  And in case you're wondering  Whether David  After spending all that time  Underwater  If he's bathed  Well  He has  No word on whether  Or when  He will be doing  His next big  Endurance  Stunt  Or what it's gonna be  Right  Or what it will be  How do you top that  And everything else  He's done  I don't know 
[01:37:00]  Maybe a vacation  For now  Thank you lord  It stinks  And I don't like it  All water  How about this  Shut up you hens  Just stick to the reading  David Blaine  Water  Hands  He's so dreamy  Just no personality  On any of them  He took his bath  I see  Hey they dumped out  Of both words  By the way 
[01:37:30]  Oh wow yeah  Of course  Yeah the survey's saying  That sex acts among teens  You know way up  Yeah  It's just figure out  Which two  Which two  There are three possibilities  One is the normal way  That's right  Do some math  The other two are way up  Way up statistically  Alright we'll take a break  It's the Opie and Anthony show  The ONA virus  Spreading across America  Prepare to be wow  What?  Mockers  Live them out 
[01:38:00]  Wednesday  Okay okay fine  Wow  Opie and Anthony  Mornings  Looks like dopey Howard Stern  Got himself in trouble  What happened  You know he's really pissed off  That we made this deal  Because this is the deal to do  Do both terrestrial radio  And satellite radio  So then he said something like  Something like  If those guys don't behave  I'm going to go back 
[01:38:30]  On terrestrial  Just to kick their ass  And we said bring it on  Because we know  You're full of ass  Come on  So then the dumb media  Picks up on it  And says  Is Howard going back  To terrestrial radio  Because he was hinting  About that on his show  Well  Serious stock  Just dropped drastically  Because that would be  Really bad for that company  Because they put all their eggs  In one basket  With Howard Stern  And they don't like  When people change their minds  Really quickly  And Mel  Have just recently come out  With a statement  Saying that  He's not looking to license 
[01:39:00]  Any of his talent  Out to anybody else  Right  So the Post wrote about it yesterday  Will Howard be making a return  To terrestrial radio  Blah blah blah  He's hinting at it  Blah blah blah  And then all the media  Picked up on it  We got a quick clip here  Well satellite  The next generation for radio  But Howard Stern  May well be coming back to earth  The shock jock  Saying he's offered  A major deal  To go back  To terrestrial radio  And at the same time  Stay on satellite  Our insiders now 
[01:39:30]  On whether it's a serious possibility  For Mr. Stern  Mike Boyle  Senior editor  And rock editor  At Billboard Radio  And Steve Strick  Rock editor  At Radio and Records  Stephen  Why do you believe  There's any credibility to this  Why is it because  Howard is talking  Well I think  There is some credibility to it  I don't think it's the first time  This offer has come in  I think it was probably  There on the table  When he was moving  From broadcast  To satellite radio  But his relationship  Toward the end  Of his career  At CBS  Was so strained 
[01:40:00]  With the management there  That I don't think  A deal like that  Could have been made  At that time  I think it's different now  I think he's seeing  Like the Opie and Anthony deal  That just got struck  Between XM and CBS  So that it's become  Opie and Anthony  Become sort of an advertisement  Their radio show  In the morning on CBS  Becomes an advertisement  For their XM show  It also offers them  A lot more  Of an audience  Right  This is the way  To deal with the deal  Dummy  So now we're hearing  Howard had to go 
[01:40:30]  On his dumb show  And say that  He's not going back  To terrestrial radio  Because it affected  The serious stock  And Mel's not happy  Over there  That's what it looked like  Anyway  In my humble opinion  Well yeah  It kind of looked like  You know  Well anyway  Wall Street never likes  When CEOs  Kind of flip flop  Right  It makes him look weak  And we got  Like when they cry  At their daughter's wedding  When the feds pull up  You know  They look weak  We got people  All over the joint  And everyone's saying  No  No one has offered him  A major deal 
[01:41:00]  To come back  To terrestrial radio  Just lying through his teeth  Once again  It's driving him nuts  That we're doing it  And he's not  Alright  I want us to be on  In England  England?  Why England?  I like England  How early we'd have to get up?  No  They would just  Play us later there  What?  It's a six hour difference  They would just  Play us whenever  Yes  Hey we should get  Nathaniel in here  Than they call him  Yeah Nathaniel  To the new listeners  Nathaniel 
[01:41:30]  You would think  It would be  Nathan  Nate  Nat  Well  Nathaniel  But his parents  In their infinite wisdom  Have decided  Than  Is better  And he is  Not even  Near  An Asian gentleman  And what annoys me  Is when he first  Started saying  That people called him  Than  I swore I would never  Because it's atrocious  As a nickname  It is  And there I am  Right along with the rest of us  Not even thinking about it  Just hey Than  He's Than to me  He talked us into it  Are you open  Are you open to a new nickname? 
[01:42:00]  What for this  Say no  It's safer  Yeah it's not going to be a good one  Yeah it's not going to be  Better than Than  It's either Than  Or hey Queer  That's Steve's already  Don't give up my nickname  Stop it  It's mine  You're going to love it  Last night  Than  Decided to watch  The ABC  Bird Flu movie  Fatal Contact  Bird Flu in America  You work hard for this show  Because I couldn't sit through  That crap 
[01:42:30]  It was  As good as you'd think  It would be  TV movie  Obviously  Yep  Who were the stars?  The biggest one  I believe was  Stacey Keech  Stacey Keech  Good old  Twinkle Twinkle  Killer Kane  Right  Old Joaquin Phoenix lip  Yeah  Does the Bird Flu  Give you a first symptom  Hair lip  He got  He got bitten  By a pelican  On his lip  When he was a baby  Bird Flu 
[01:43:00]  Off with his lip  He played the  Secretary of State  Yeah  I bet you that was  Very believable  Well  Yeah  Also he represented  The government  They clearly didn't want  To get too many actors  They didn't want to  Get up higher  And have the president  Involved  Yeah  He like makes references  To last night's  President's news conference  Uh huh  But then  But he actually  Does all the speaking  I like when they don't  Want to commit  Yeah  Disaster films 
[01:43:30]  Are coming back  Yeah  Poseidon  In movie theaters  The Bird Flu movie  On TV  You're going to be  Seeing a lot of  Tributes to Erwin Allen  Towering Inferno  Earthquake  They'll start remaking those  Yeah  With all the new  Special effects  You would think  That would be a no brainer  Towering Inferno  They won't do  That's a little too  Close to home  Yeah  Right  Alright  Earthquake movies  So the Bird Flu movie  Thumbs up  Thumbs down  Thumbs way down  Open  How many times 
[01:44:00]  Did you curse  The Opinant Anthony  Show during this  Oh you mean like  At 11 when I was  Finishing up editing  I had to be awake  At 4  Oh  Yeah well  Here's the  I loved way down  I love Thad's writing  Melodramatic intro  Okay  The H5N1 flu virus  Is currently infecting  Wild birds and poultry  In 48 countries  In Asia, Europe, the Middle East  And Africa  Human cases have been  Very limited  And have resulted  In approximately  125 deaths 
[01:44:30]  According to experts  The avian flu  Cannot be contracted  By eating properly  Cooked poultry  So far  There has not been  A known transmission  Of the disease  In the form  Which could fuel  A pandemic  However  Scientists continue  To debate the potential  For this or another  Influenza virus  To mutate  And then be easily  Passed among human beings  This film is a fictional  Examination of the question  What if  Why do they start with that?  What if  Why would you talk like that? 
[01:45:00]  It's almost a  Disclaimer  Yep  It's almost a disclaimer  Very tricky  They said that the avian flu  Hasn't been passed  They try to make it sound like  It could be passed  Human to human  Or they don't avoid it  In that statement  He didn't say  It's never been passed  Human to human  They say it's never been passed  In such a way  That might start a pandemic  Oh that's human to human  Yeah  But if they say that 
[01:45:30]  It sounds less threatening  Than if they just say  In a certain way  It will never be a pandemic  And these scientists  Have got to come out  And say that  Enough with the fear  We have enough fear  In our lives  You got a kook over there  In Iran  Yeah we got all sorts of  Crazy  Just one  Yeah well the one  Just one kook over there  Well it only takes one  The leader  Building atom bombs  The leader is a kook  Yes I say there's one kook  In Iran  There's enough fear  In this world  We don't need  Disaster movies  About the bird flu  Getting us 
[01:46:00]  The bird flu  The only way to really get it  Is to share a needle  With a bird  How many times  Do you do that  Alright here we go  What is the next track  The spread sound effect  What's that  Oh so first of all  They this American guy  Goes over to do business  In Hong Kong or something  And picks up this new  Airborne bird flu  Which doesn't exist  And comes back  And then they do this  Cheesy thing  Where they zoom in  With the CG  To show that germs  On his napkin 
[01:46:30]  Or whatever  Being spread  To different things  And then they show  I think they ran out  Of CG budget  Because then they  Just every time  He kisses his wife  Or shakes somebody's hand  They just have this  Sort of string swell  Oh like a certain sound  That tells that  It's being transmitted  Yeah  Alright let's  Let's hear that now  That sounds familiar  Mr. Hanalee  Can fix everything  I did nothing wrong  Where are the children  Mr. Hanalee 
[01:47:00]  But I did nothing wrong  We heard you  Now it plays  That's another virus  Being spread  Bobby  That's killing  A lot more people  Bobby  Could you get my  Robe and broth  What is Mrs. Brady  Getting  Oops  Oops  Love  Hey good 
[01:47:30]  What the hell's going on  Hey Dan told me  You got the promotion  Oh okay  Okay  Sorry  This is where  Marsha walked in  Right at the  Right at the moment  Of passion  With Mr. and Mrs. Brady  And inadvertently  Something bad happened  Hey you guys  I don't know  Caught it right in the nose  So without further ado  Here's the spread  Sound effect  From the  Bird flu movie  Fatal con 
[01:48:00]  Attack  Go  Tony  Go  Good job son  Hey Ed  How's it going  Hey good  Good  Hey Dental  There it is  There it is  We know what happened  They're lucky to have you  What did they shake hands  Yeah  They shook hands  That's it  They shook hands  With birds  Every time he high fives  A stork  Dramatic music plays  Alright here's the next clip 
[01:48:30]  Are you okay  I messed up  I'm coming down with something  No way  Connelly's don't get sick right  Think what's in the store  I'm just sinking  In your little face  Of course the Connelly's never get sick  Guess what happens  To the Connelly's  The Connelly's dead  Yes 
[01:49:00]  All of them from the bird flu  Any father that refers to his family  By their last name  Like as a team  Deserves to die  The Connelly's  Team Connelly  T-shirts that say  The Connelly  Team Connelly  Exactly  Five minutes later  He's passing on the floor  With blood issuing  Out of his nose  Because that happens  With the bird flu  I guess so  I guess that's the part  Where you grow a beak  And it starts coming out  It's not like  American werewolf  In London  The Connelly's  Never fly around  And defecate  On your car windshield 
[01:49:30]  What happened to the Ebola virus  That was the one  That was very scary  For a while  And they had their movies  About the Ebola  Ebola is I think  So fast  That it's easier to control  Because it ruins you  So quickly  Ebola's a rough one  In days  Yeah but they didn't tell us  That at the time  It can't really leave Africa  Like that's where  It's really contained  Because the second  It spreads  And someone gets it  They run 20 yards  And they're gone  Yeah  You know  It spreads pretty quickly  You sneeze  And your intestines  Are in your socks  And it's not like 
[01:50:00]  Thank God for airport security  Thank God for airport security  Because you're waiting online  To get on a plane  From Africa to the United States  And you're just  You know  Apparently you don't even  Make to the airport  You're just melting  In front of everybody  I hear that mass transit  Really stinks over there  Yeah  Your elephant's late  You can't get a flight  What is track four all about?  Oh  Just to make sure  That people are sufficiently scared  They have to use the analogy  It's like  They have to bring 
[01:50:30]  Hurricane Katrina  Into the analogy  Oh well of course  The damage  What?  The flu would do  We believe that the  Ultimate global loss of lives  Could reach as high as  150  Or 350 million  And what if we close our borders  Now  Today  Shut down all the airports  Seal ourselves off  I'm afraid it's too late for that  Well since 9-11  And Hurricane Katrina  We've upgraded our emergency response plans  This is much worse than Katrina 
[01:51:00]  This is like a Hurricane Katrina  Hitting every city and every state  At the same time  Oh  Please  Tell it to every convenience store owner  In Houston  It's like a Hurricane Katrina  Hitting every city  At the same time  What?  What?  Who sponsored this movie?  Am I getting a flu  Or is my basement flooding?  This movie stinks  Alright we gotta take a quick break  And we'll continue with  ABC bird flu movie  Fatal contact

[01:56:30]  The president wants to beat the press  And address the nation  He needs to do it quickly  The avian flu is in America  He's asking you to wake up  Who am I?  How dramatic  How overly dramatic drivel  The Connellys don't surf  Team Connelly  Dead  The Connellys dead  The whole family  What did they have?  How many kids? 
[01:57:00]  Actually only the dad died  See they didn't even commit  No guess what happened  What?  The little boy got sick  Yeah  But he got better  Of course  Because it's gotta work that way  Make the commitment  Who cured him?  House  On an all new house  House  The avian flu hits house  House takes on the world  He thought it was a case of the sniffles  When she was brought in  But she started convulsing in the ER  Turned out to be avian flu 
[01:57:30]  How will house cure it?  Oh I don't know  But he will  He will by the end of the hour  He'll figure out a way  He'll watch something  He'll look at his toaster  And figure out  Ah  That's how I can fix it  He's the MacGyver of the ER  He is  He stinks  House  It's always  Last night I'm watching something  American Idol  And of course  The house promo comes on  And it's about some woman  And she's convulsing  Of course  And then she has a baby  And the baby disappears  What? 
[01:58:00]  I don't know  The baby disappeared  On an all new house  By the way  Here's how you cure the avian flu  Get an immune system  Faggot  Hudson from South Carolina  Doc  Hudson you gotta get in fast  Let's go  Hudson  You also have audio  Of someone dying  From the bird flu  You got audio  Of someone dying on the phone  Oh sorry about that  That's alright  You're sleepy  He has a great idea 
[01:58:30]  That would be  Ben Sparks snoring  Also  He's gonna make a  Ben Sparks snoring  Bird flu reference  A Ben Sparks snoring joke  And I was pointing out  Can we find Ben Sparks  Snoring for me please  I was pointing out to Anthony  That Ben has his t-shirt  Tucked in  Yeah  Which is the first true sign  Of complete mental illness  Yeah  When you're in a morning radio show  And you tuck your t-shirt in  He's tucked in his t-shirt  You know what that is  That's an attempt at straightening things out  That's like 
[01:59:00]  Today is gonna be a fresh  Different start  Tuck in my shirt  Yeah that to him is a good start  Yeah  I tucked in my shirt  I'm getting organized  He turned over a new leaf  Unfortunately  There was a bag of white stuff under it  Let's get back to the  The bird flu movie from last night  Fatal contact  Bird flu in America  How about these  This next clip  What happens to Bonnie  Yeah they're doing the autopsy  On Team Connolly  Oh wow  Okay  Team Connolly  Team Connolly needs a new quarterback 
[01:59:30]  Mommy better get working  Look mommy's introducing a black friend  To Team Connolly  Oh god  Mommy the cougar  Better find a new quarterback  Yeah mom's a cougar  Out there hunting  My husband died of the bird flu  Where are you going?  Not all patients with H5 get odds  For those that do  Like 40 to 60% of them will die  An hour prior to his death  He complained of body aches so intense 
[02:00:00]  He thought his bones were breaking  Oh I think I got that  So violently  That he tore apart his abdominal muscles  And his rib cartilage  Basically he drowned in his own blood  What kind of  Is that the woman doing the autopsy  Or a doctor or something  Why does she sound so  She has the most wooden delivery  For the entire movie  He's Dr. Melfi's scalpel  I love the squishy sound effects 
[02:00:30]  In the background  And he ripped apart his abdominal  He ripped apart his abdominal muscles  And he drowned in his own blood  And then he threw me out of the car  He said I had the sniffles  I said I didn't  Karen  Where's the medicine?  They were going to find it Henry  They were and we need that  Robitussin for the bird flu  They were going to find it 
[02:01:00]  Never not a moment for a Goodfellas reference  It's always  Here's the rule of thumb for Goodfellas references  Always appropriate  Every single time  The next clip here  It mutates  Dramatic drum hit  What's this about?  Uh just  Every time something happens  They do  Dun dun dun dun  With the tom toms  And now the flu mutates  The flu mutates  Warrants  Because now it makes it 
[02:01:30]  That much harder to cure  Yes  Yes  She's in Angola  Following up on some rumors  What rumors?  That the virus may have mutated again  Evidently several remote villages  Have been entirely wiped out  Has she got anything?  She's just emailed me  She says the body count is staggering  Like nothing she's ever seen before  This is some of the worst acting ever 
[02:02:00]  Yeah it stinks  Gosh  The writing's good though  Yeah  I mean we barely started to get distribution lines back up  The entire economy is on the brink of falling apart  In 1918 when the Spanish flu hit  There was a relatively mild first wave in the spring  Boring  Now in the fall  The devastating second wave came  Which resulted in masses of casualties  We have gone from 7 million dead  To nearly 20 million  In just the past few weeks 
[02:02:30]  To we  You're telling me that's mild?  Compared to 300 million  It's the tip of the iceberg  Stunt  Dun dun dun dun  That's awful  Not a crutch about  That's horrible  Now I wish I saw this  Wait was that Stacey Keach?  Yeah  Yeah  Poor Stacey Keach  Alright we gotta  When he said the body count  Most people would have been horrified  I have to admit  It kinda turned me on  What type of people are these 
[02:03:00]  Sneezing and coughing with pelicans  This  Yeah  This last one is the end  Where the governor  That made some wrong decisions  Meets up with the  The lady of the family that died  And they have a moment  Oh is it a Jaws moment?  Oh how many Jaws moments  Have you seen with a kitten or mom  In every movie?  The slap in the face?  No  There was one on TV recently 
[02:03:30]  Where a mom was in a graveyard  And had to slap somebody in the face  You knew  And you did nothing  Smack the face  Blah blah blah  We've seen it  Kitten her boy's mom  And now that person has to try harder  I was very impressed to hear about the work you and your community were doing  Helping each other out  Mrs. Connolly I'd like to ask you a favor  Of you and your family  We've started a fund  To help the families of the flu victims 
[02:04:00]  Survivors like you  With your permission of course  We'd like to name it  The Edward Connolly Relief Fund  We'd be honored  That's terrific  That moment  That's terrific  We can move on  But we won't ever forget  Look fellas  Let's be reasonable  This is not the time or place  To perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy  On the Connolly family  And I for one 
[02:04:30]  Won't stand here  While you cut him open  And watch his bleeding liver  Pour it out all over the dock  This is the peak season  We're not closing that nest  Fourth of July  Those nests will stay open  I want those birds  Hung up by their beaks  And by the way  We'll never forget  I already forgot his name  The Connolly man  Oh yeah  He's just a Connolly man  Alright we got two really  We got two really fast clips 
[02:05:00]  And then we gotta get the hell out of here  To start the second half of the show  On XM  Just quickly  So this is right before the end  Yeah  And they spent five minutes  Showing everybody that you've met  Like being happy  There are couples dancing  People watching TV  And then they go to Africa  Where this new mutation is happening  Oh so we think everything's cool  Yes  And fine but then new mutation  Kind of like Jaws  Was it Jaws 2  Where they kill Jaws again  And then at the last second  They show like a baby shark  Yeah 
[02:05:30]  They're like oh no  They didn't kill it  Don't you know there's a problem  It's coming back again  Because of the time  Length of time  It's a 9 to 11 movie  And if all of a sudden  They're showing celebrating  At like 10.06  Yeah  You're like wow  54 more minutes of cheering  Or something else is gonna happen  God you make a great point  You know what show does that  It's stupid deal or no deal  The guy's got the million dollars  Still on the board  And it's 858  And I'm like ah  He's gotta take the deal 
[02:06:00]  It's obvious  They gotta end the freaking show  That's what I hate  About watching poker also  You gotta cover up the clock  Sometimes when you watch TV  You know if there's five minutes left  And one guy's got this huge stack  Right  And the other guy is pretty much broke  You know who's winning  Right  So you gotta DVR it  And then play it at some wacky time  I'm starting this show  At 8.43  That's when you start it  And then you have no clue  There you go  Alright two more clips  And then we gotta get out of here  Really fast  It's not possible is it  All of them 
[02:06:30]  Dead  It's not only possible  It's already out there  They're here  Birds flying  And this sort of death count  At the bottom of the screen  Yeah  25 million  Skyrocketing up  Janice Rossi has the bird flu  Janice Rossi has the bird flu 
[02:07:00]  In your apartment  There's a pigeon living in your building  Get your own Connolly  And then after that  The movie ends  Yes  Go ahead  After that terrifying ending  With the rock skyrocketing  Head count  Yeah  Death count  They have one of the actors  You know  Out of character  Steps out of character  Oh wow  I love when they do this  Tears down the fifth wall  I'm this idiot  Who is it 
[02:07:30]  Big bird from Sesame Street  Today there have been no cases  Of the H5N1 virus  In the United States  Nor has there been  A human transmission  Of the disease  In a form that could fuel a pandemic  Nor has there been  A good movie made about it  However experts around the world  Are monitoring the avian flu situation  Closely  And are preparing for the possibility  That the virus could begin to spread  From person to person  For more information on the virus  Log on to pandemicflu.gov  Oh  Stop it  Okay

[02:25:00]  Show studios  The daily dump report  Thank you Steve  Thank you  Yes the first half  Of the Opie and Anthony  Show is over  And it's time to  See what they  Dumped out of  On regular radio  I think we have  A record here  For the day  Uh not as far  As number of dumps  But how quickly  Something was dumped  Yeah  One minute into the show  6-0-1  A caller  Talk shit to Stern  That's what he said  Right  And then it's 6-0-8  We also have a caller  Violating our program 
[02:25:30]  With the uh  Phrase  No shit  Uh  7-10 a.m  This is Opie  Talking about  K-Fed and  Britney Spears  Of course we learned  That she's pregnant  With her second child  Opie actually said  Find a bitch  Worth 125 million  And lock that pussy up  Yeah I didn't think 
[02:26:00]  That was gonna make it  When you said it  That's also number one  On the R&B charts  It's one of K-Fed's tunes  Yeah  7-53  Teens having oral  And anal sex  Opie talking about  Teen sex survey  That one's not fair  Because that's how  It was uh  Printed in the paper  This morning  There are no rules  That state  You can just  Say things  Because they're in the paper  That's not the way  It works  But we were  The paper has certain 
[02:26:30]  Is given certain latitude  That we are not given  And that is one of them  You can't say  Teens having oral  And anal sex  Until you get here  Then you could say  Teens getting  Cocks rammed up  Their assholes  And no one really cares  That's why you have  The XM people  That's why  7-57 AM  Here it is  We're talking  About the asshole  That's Norton  Talking about  Teen sex survey  And wondering  What type of sex  They were talking about 
[02:27:00]  Well that's  That's basically  A gray area  Yeah  It's double entendre  We were trying  To get around  The touchy situation  And Jimmy  Out of nowhere  He just blurts out  We're talking about  The asshole  And 8-26 AM  At opieandanthony.com  During wow bumper  We will edit it out  On our end  So we don't have  To dump out of it  That shit has to be fixed  With the website mentioned  That has to be fixed  Being worked on  All right 
[02:27:30]  It's a slow process  Why can't you mention  Your website  Because there are  Certain links  Porn  On our website  That they are  Uncomfortable with  Having three clicks  Being three clicks  Away from smut  Seems to be a problem  But you know  I could go from  Disney to smut  In three clicks  You can type  Any word into  A search engine  Yeah  And one of the  First hits  Will be porn  Porn  Yeah  You can type in  Christian prayer  And you will get  Christian prayer porn  Yeah  You don't even have  To click off  Of the site  It's like right there  On the Christian 
[02:28:00]  Porn site  The lad is kneeling  Christian  Yeah well  All right  Here we are  For today  That's your dump report  That is what  They missed  Why don't you do  A sanitized version  Of your website  You know like  You can't advertise  Poker  In the United States  So you have like  Oh we'll train you  To do poker  Oh we should have  Opie and Anthony  Dot net  And that's true  Make the mistake  And go to dot com  That old gag  Go to dot com  We'll figure it out  We'll figure it out  People are figuring it out 
[02:28:30]  Yeah  So we got Laszlo  In the studio  To talk some tech stuff  Today  Also big A phone sex  Oh gosh  You want to get right  To the big A stuff  Because we did tease that  At the end of the show  Left off yesterday  Left off yesterday  Big A  On pal talk  Everyone knows  What pal talk is now  Right  It's a little camera  Video conferencing thing  That people get on  And  As they're  As they're chatting  In the old days  You just used to chat  With text  Now you got a camera 
[02:29:00]  And you can do that  Video conferencing  With people  I don't see any cams  Are there any girls  In the room  And then if you hook up  Well I just got here  Oh okay  If you hook up  Then you go private  You could take  You could take your conversation  To a private room  And get a little sexy  A little dirty  Saucy  Saucy  Get a little saucy  Saucy  And apparently  Big A got a little saucy  On himself  From what I hear  Can I interrupt for a second  You certainly can  E-Rock decided to put in 
[02:29:30]  The phrase  Christian prayer  Into Google  Yeah  And to see  And then see what website  Would come up  I'm glad he's working  The first one  Is  Free info  About porn  And sexual addictions  What'd I tell you  Wow  The first one  Yeah  There it is  See  So what's this  What's this whole thing  About  That's like  And then number two  Is help for Christian spouses  Of sex addicts  Oh my god 
[02:30:00]  It's all about the sex  As porn  Strongly appeals  To our  Natural  Dot dot dot  Whatever so  There are people  Complaining to the FCC now  Because when you're stuck  In traffic  And you've got one of these  Mi-Fi's  That has the FM transmitter  In it  And you're listening  To Opie and Anthony  Well the cars next to you  That are listening to  Like a Christian station  Or NPR  They're usually at the  Weird end of the spectrum  Yeah it's like  88.1  88.5  Or whatever  If a car is in the proximity  Then somebody listening  To Opie and Anthony  It's going to override  That Christian station 
[02:30:30]  And these knuckleheads  Give them good radio  Right  Are actually writing  Complaint letters  To the FCC  Because they think  Their Christian stations  Have gone like  Guy talk  Oh they turn in  Their own station  Yeah  They're like  I can't believe  They switched  And some of the  Complaints are like  I can't believe  You guys switched to  Hip hop  Hip hop  Hip hop  Yeah because  Everybody's listening  To hip hop  On their iPod  Alright so we go  Right back into  The big A thing  Where were you  I'm sorry  Yeah well  Big A was on  Pal Talk  He's been on there 
[02:31:00]  For a while now  A lot of people  Have been doing it  To ONA fans  Here for months  And he hooked up  With some girl  From Australia  Blaze Angel  Blaze Angel  That's her MySpace  Blaze Angel  One word  B-L-A-I-Z-E  Angel  Blaze Angel  And he hooked up  They went into  This private room  And started getting  A little saucy  With each other  And Big A  He pulled it out 
[02:31:30]  And started jacking  Exactly  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  And he  Yeah started jacking  And she's talking  Dirty to him  And he's trying  To talk dirty  To her  Which is just  Hysterical  What did he say  At one point  Hot cum  Yeah I want my  Hot cum  On you  Does the accent  Does her accent  Add anything to it  Because chicks  With British and Australian accents  Always sound hotter 
[02:32:00]  Than they are  Yeah  She sounds pretty hot  She doesn't have that  Heavy an accent  Right  Which is a little odd  And Steve has seen the video  Now you have the video  Yeah  Can we play it in here  Can we play it in here  We all want to see the video  At the same time  No one has seen  The actual video  In this room right  No  Because I want to get  The natural reaction  When we see Big A  Whacking it for the first time  I think what I can do  Is put it on a thing  Upload it somewhere  And then give us  The secret URL  Oh there it is  Stupid volume  Yeah I think  I'll put it somewhere 
[02:32:30]  And just give Eric  Where it is  Alright that'll work  You can actually see it  Myspace.com  Slash Jim Norton  No Jimmy  No you can't  You can't  It's not Big A  Jerk off material  You can't  Whoring ass  No I wouldn't lie  Alright here  You would  You do  So here we go  We got to play  Just the first part  Of the first clip  Because it's one  Of the funniest moments  In Opie and Anthony history  Yeah  I don't know if it'll  Do it justice  To hear it for the second time  But just listen to this  This is when we discover  That Big A  Is about to have  Phone slash video 
[02:33:00]  Pal talk sex  With a girl  From Australia  So you want to play  Birdie with you  Here in the room  With me  You want to  Take a  Big talk  For me  So if I can  My feel  And make you come  Is that it  Is that what you want  I'm scared  I'm scared  I'm scared  I'm scared  I'm scared  I'm scared  I'm scared  I'm scared  I'm scared  I'm scared  I'm scared  Yeah  Have fun  To me  Why don't you come up

[02:36:30]  Communism  Happens every time  One of those dancers  Start poontanging around  With those show folk facts  Here's a word of advice  If you're ever  Cammed up  And jerking off  For someone  Who you can't see  And they're laughing  Like they're watching  A Marx Brothers marathon  They're not about to come  Yeah  He didn't even acknowledge  The fact that she  Busted out laughing  He just kept on going  Like the thought  That it was  Not real  And that he would have to  You know  Tuck it away  In shame and disgrace

[03:07:30]  got james carville james carville that's right right got a bone of contention to pick with james carville  you do yes those back four years james mr how are you sir mr carville how are you sir i'm great  james has a uh a show on xm 60 20 sports yes sir on uh xm live xm 202 200 xm 200 200 we're  on 202 we're on 202 i'm plugging myself change all of that in in june or july or something is that 
[03:08:00]  what they're gonna do i don't know that that that that's what's the room with that that's  xm headquarters at the corner of north of uh what is it new york and florida the center of the world  yeah down there in dc now this is you and uh a younger guy talking sports and other things  it's tim russert's son right that's correct yeah that's correct and they do a sports show  kind of a generation gap thing right right and uh how's that working out i i never had more fun 
[03:08:30]  doing anything i envy you i mean that you guys get i mean it's it's an hour a week which is fine  because it works my schedule really really good but look what's better work than sitting around  shooting the bull about sports yeah i mean i i you know that there's some so much better than  politics so much more fun so much more interesting you know it just and it just the sports world just  keeps reloading on you i mean yeah you never there's you never out of stuff it's always something new uh  every game but do you got you guys ever get into uh other subject matter every so often kind of 
[03:09:00]  well weak on it a little bit because we'll be like talking about this uh you know billy pain and the  guster and should women be in there and we talk about steroids drugs that kind of stuff but it's  all it all has a sports origin to it like if you're talking about baseball will you ever say something  like uh the rangers lost tonight and speaking of texas bush is an imperialist pig back to you  bill bill yeah it could happen yeah uh you know sandals is you know dallas and and san antonio are 
[03:09:30]  playing and you know that whole like you know iq of the two teams you know is you know five million  or something yeah it could happen what is uh what is luke's uh political affiliation uh you have to ask  kim you don't even know i don't like it's never you know it's just all about sport never brought up  yeah it doesn't we don't what's what's your take i mean you wouldn't know what my political affiliation 
[03:10:00]  was if you listen to the sports show right no we probably not we probably would you would because  you knew going in yeah i'm sure you don't want barry bonds breaking baby roots records  i uh yeah i have a little bone to pick with you about four about four years ago or so was it five i  don't even remember uh the opie and anthony show was uh removed from the airwaves for a little  incident at saint patrick's cathedral yeah um i watched a program i watched a lot of programs a 
[03:10:30]  lot of anchors and stuff uh people doing commentary talking about how we will never do radio again  blackballed forever um how this was an awful horrible thing which you know we did a kind of agree  uh to that part of it but you kept calling us opie and andy and it bugged the crap out of me  all you kept saying was uh it is a horrible thing that opie and andy are doing horrible thing uh  uh these these two shouldn't be on the air anymore i don't i don't i don't think they should be giving 
[03:11:00]  the job that opie and andy and i'm sitting there going he's not only lambasting us saying we should  be blackballed but he's not even getting my name right you sounded like a dope i sound like you're  wearing blackface well the truth of the matter is i'm dyslexic and learning disabled and everything  else i would i wouldn't feel too bad you know i don't think you're the first name i ever butchered  in my life yeah that's true you killed a few you killed us from the south and opium andy is a kind  of natural thing to say oh yeah you know five years ago you know you killed us though let it go five 
[03:11:30]  years you killed us on cnn you killed us you got it and you became you you became an expert on uh  talk radio all of a sudden shock jocks guess what you got you you in the end you won because you're  still on the and crossfire is not that is victory and survival five years we should let it go so in  uh in two more years are you going to say let the war go can it that is that i wouldn't quite say  if if if saying opie and anthony is the equivalent of the war then okay now there's more bloodshed 
[03:12:00]  in here i think especially lately what are the uh off the just a quick question politics what what  are the democrats doing uh so why are they seem like such horrible candidates like why does john  carrey because bush was so beatable and such a blunderer it seemed and yet carrie just couldn't  do it what's wrong i think bro wrote a whole book about it uh so if you got a week i'll be glad to sit  you're right democrats are we've not done politics very well and at the presidential level and sometimes 
[03:12:30]  and i think that what we tend to do is say too many things and not go after at at you know go  more for try to go to people's heads and not their guts and more more appropriately not try to rip their  hearts out what happened poor carrie sitting up there trying to have a positive convention in boston and  they swift bolting him to death and going at him from which way every way you can and that's what  happens and these guys you know one could hope that they were one-tenth as good in in in in 
[03:13:00]  governing his politics but unfortunately they're not but we got to get better at politics we got  we got pretty tough guys out there now we got ron emmanuel the congressional committee we got chuck  schumer you guys know him in new york yeah but do you think hillary clinton a lot of people are  saying she's going to be like a nomination should be a viable candidate do you really think that she  can beat uh you know i mean obviously mccain or anyone else yeah i can't imagine that hey she  wouldn't carry a state that carried it so it puts a one shot so i mean you kind of start out  at 260 and you got to get to 269 i don't know i think uh i think i hope there's a whole bunch of 
[03:13:30]  states out there that she could carry and you know what when you came in who would have thought that  she'd become like the most popular politician in history in new york state i don't know if she's  well known i don't know if she's well liked everywhere in new york a lot of go home hillary stickers  i'd say ed koch was a little better liked than her and uh i mean rudy kind of let's see what let you  know what yeah have me on on uh after the november election well i know that's what i want to ask  about also we'll see i think at this point if the democrats can't just run away with uh the midterm 
[03:14:00]  elections here uh then you guys are really in trouble because you guys are pretty much getting  it handed to you i think what the democrats have to do though is is focus a little more the the republicans  always seem to have their core and they you know they have uh they have extremists at both  end of their core but at least it's a core you guys are all over the place really it's like trying  to satisfy everybody oh i see oh yeah yeah let's see what their core is you think you think that you 
[03:14:30]  ought to ban uh birth control pills no it's wrong of course not well that's what i'm not saying it's  right what i'm saying here's a problem the problem is is do you know everybody has got again i wrote  a book i think that that it is legit the problem with the democrats is to act like a group of interest  groups so they get up there and they say something to please the teachers or the trial lawyers the  unions or whatever i think that's that's absolutely valid observation however having said all of that 
[03:15:00]  i think that a they're getting a little better and there's nothing that could be worse than what  we're watching right now well that's why if you look and if the democrats are so bad why does two  thirds of the country say the country was better off i'm not i'm not saying so bad i'm just saying  they're so bad at getting elected especially when uh i agree with you again what can i do i wrote a  whole book criticizing the way that we run campaigns i got i'm i'm in your corner on this one you need uh 
[03:15:30]  what what what was it that clinton had and at what time that really put him over the top  that we just can't i think a he had he he liked politics a lot of these guys don't  they they they they want to they want to govern without having that they want to have kids without  having sex all right that he liked he liked that he liked the campaign and he didn't let you know if  he made a mistake he only made it once and you can't you can't let this stuff fester around on you and 
[03:16:00]  i think what would happen here what would carry is is that they left they they left the floodgates  open the bush came to bush people came in on them from every side by the time they came in it was too  late do you think clinton ran a great campaign or is it that bush senior just ran an awful campaign  because he's like he was in a pretty electable position at that point yeah i think i think that  the the the reality is is that the primaries were sort of tougher than the general election 
[03:16:30]  you know but it did you know what if he's the only democrat that's been elected since 1976  and we're coming up on 2008 so well i think i think we're looking at an american public now that kind of  wants to see the pendulum swing the other way just to balance things out whether you're you know a  democrat or a republican you're kind of looking like we need to balance this out again uh and i think  the democrats will do good unless they completely screw the pooch again uh i think you guys are going to do 
[03:17:00]  very well in the midterms i'm i'm i'm less i i think that a it's it's possible we could we could  really screw the pooch together and i think that they're going to fight pretty hard before they  they give up power bush's approval rating today's down at 31 by the way yeah i saw that in the paper  but um i'm i you know what wait till wait till you see all the stuff that's going to happen between  now and election day i mean they're not guys are not going to give up power easily and  do we'll see i'm i'm i'm cautiously optimistic but you know i never i'm i'm too too i've been 
[03:17:30]  around too long to get overly optimistic bro the country is really in a sour mood and can you blame  them i mean just look around giuliani do you think he's gonna run for anything i mean he's a really uh  i mean obviously i think a very well-liked guy well-respected i don't see how he has to change  his position on abortion and gays to have any chance in a republican party wait is he is oh  he's pretty moderate that's what i'm saying with the country though they may be uh the country doesn't 
[03:18:00]  seem like they'd mind a moderate republican yeah but the republicans don't you you gotta you gotta  get the republicans vote for you before you can get to the country it might be doing do fine if you  get to the country without the republicans that's true so what a few a few abortion clinic bombings and  then he kind of eases off yeah who knows but i i mean i think what you guys say unfortunately i  agree with most of the things that you say yeah now i think that i think i but i think yeah i think 
[03:18:30]  the democrats would do some evidence that they're getting better and they get better people and  then you know we'll see they come off as very and i'm not saying they are but my impression of them  is like a lot of times they come off as is rather condescending and smug and maybe look the  conservatives come off that way to a lot of people too but that to me is my main problem  with the democrats some some some you know particularly in in in in some parts of the  country it's like you stupid people you don't know what's good for you you know right we tell  you to do or or they they don't think that's i think again not of all democrats not of most democrats 
[03:19:00]  but i think it's fair to say that there's some democrats that come across as condescending  know-it-alls nothing again but i don't i mean i know most of them here and i don't think that  i mean that certainly was not in any way shape or form the way that clinton was  but you know yeah quite to the contrary he came off kind of conservative for uh a democrat as far as 
[03:19:30]  he didn't come off like a bleeding heart he didn't come off like he was against the  i mean he's before the death penalty right he was yeah i didn't yeah he probably was on some  things he was he was fairly moderate but i don't think the country is like out there screaming for  a liberal democrat either but do you do you think they would elect uh and again i know this is the  old will woman ever be elected but i always felt that they were going to elect a woman you'd have to  get both sides kind of going on it and i and i felt it would have to be a uh a republican woman if you're  going to get a woman elected or the first woman elected with the first minority elected because you want to 
[03:20:00]  get conservative votes if she has conservative policy and there are a lot of liberals that would  go over and do it just because they see the bigger picture or they see it as an important thing to do  to elect a woman or to elect a black i see your point i'm not sure i agree with it okay but i see your  point i actually think that for a lot of reasons i think he would be pretty electable but it would have  to yeah i mean because you really have you have an intervening campaign and she's a hell of a smart  person and she's a hell of a good campaigner and so you just can't take the political events are not 
[03:20:30]  static you don't look at them where they are today you try to figure where they're going to be  and if she goes through and beats seven eight people in the primaries well kerry came out the  primaries he was in pretty good shape just what he let happen to him over the summer that croaked  him yeah well more important there was no i'm sorry go ahead i'm sorry i was going to say i didn't  mean interrupt you i was going to say but more importantly uh why does randy johnson suck so badly in 
[03:21:00]  the yankee uniform there you go why is mike the scene of pitching so well he lost a game last  night what are you one game out of first place i'm a randy johnson disliker they got slaughtered  last night well i know but but i mean i look the great thing about baseball is well i went to some  game in yankee stadium during the republican convention is what cleveland won 23 to nothing or  something i mean the great thing about your football big gloss wipes you out right and  baseball next next night you know if you get good start in pitching and you're back in you come back 
[03:21:30]  and win i mean yankee fans y'all try how about being the washington nationals and then having the  orioles as your second team i mean you guys are man y'all can complain about everything in the world  randy johnson you know try having you know the pitching we don't even have a left-hander we'll take  anything you got i'll take you can you are you left-handed what uh jim's no left no what what made 
[03:22:00]  you go which is odd you you know is obviously a you know brilliant political guy what made you go how  did it come about that you're doing a sports radio show it's a very odd switch all of my life i've always  wanted to sports radio so i get a car and it has this xm radio and i said this is the best thing  i've ever heard it's like not even close to anything else and i started thinking and uh  him and our friends and luke and i at the game i was thinking you know what we would like have all 
[03:22:30]  of these big discussions and so from 61 and so i kind of made some calls called some friends i had  called xm people went by i see them and said look i got this idea and they said let's do it  that is that's pretty cool you know it's like one hour day i have no desire to do anything else it's  we got we've actually gonna you know we take the show it runs and they give us we run friday morning  saturday morning and it just is a to be up to always want and i was a kid i like practice you know 
[03:23:00]  like calling of you know the baseball games being a color guy in the box and you know what i mean that  kind of stuff it was just always something i've always wanted to do and i said well let's try to  do it and get it done and it's worked out and turned out to be more fun than anything that i've  done and it's so much more fun and then dealing with politics on on a daily basis and and like i  say and the good thing about sports is if you into sports commentary or whatever you call it is 
[03:23:30]  they just keep they just keep giving you stuff right yeah something you know i mean there's always a  score and there's always a steroid there's always a dui and there's always a trade uh you just name  it well it seems the bush administration keeps giving you something new every day also yeah but  i you know what you just get tired of i mean it's just it's just dead bodies and deficits and flooded  houses and it's too much work it's too much work you're retiring to be with their family yeah yeah  exactly this is like you know people running in the walls you know randy johnson getting sued by you 
[03:24:00]  you know what i mean that the kid or something like that that's that's that's more fun what's  your take on barry bonds he's a horrible guy i mean they didn't sign the autograph for the soldiers  yeah yeah we haven't even talked about that yet which homer was it 712 was it 713 or 713  713 yeah and what a jerk i mean it's and you know it's it's not like barry bonds didn't have a pretty  good pretty good handout to him in life yeah and the guy was on track if barry bonds would have never 
[03:24:30]  heard of a steroid he'd probably been one of the ten best baseball players in history all right  it's all and now it's all in it but i'm not for the asterisk just everybody knows all right put it  in their head and people know what went on they're not stupid don't need an asterisk to tell them that  yeah that's going to follow you know put an asterisk it'll never ever he'll never get away from it  because you don't you never know what was going on look every every era in baseball has problems  whether it's the blacks didn't play or yeah bae bruce didn't have to hit you know hispanic or 
[03:25:00]  black pitches right hispanic black pitchers have never really made a tremendous impact but hispanic  pitchers have yeah but that everybody might get in the past it made incredible if she could go you  know try one metal hispanic you know bob gibson you know i agree but i'm just saying and he didn't play  night ball right i mean you know something he was he was a little busy at night little booze and women  it doesn't you just don't you don't need when they moved the mound up you didn't put an asterisk 
[03:25:30]  that made a huge i mean it moved it down that when they should you know that made a huge difference  remember carl yastrzemski like won the american league batting tower with 301 bat now that's the  year of the pitcher right right but what happened is right after that they dropped the mound  and that made a huge difference well you don't have an asterisk that says he hit this many home  runs before with the mound at so many feet and then he hit this many home runs with the mound at  some less feet but it made a difference i think that the art and i agree with you although the 
[03:26:00]  argument for that would be yeah but a that was something that was uh equal for everybody in the  league and there was no nothing illegal or against league policy being done i i agree and  you bet you also if you put the asterisk about barry bonds how do you know what we don't know  what pitches we take everybody knows barry bonds took steroids you don't need an asterisk because then  you get into an argument about this asterisk or that asterisk and i just think you just let you know 
[03:26:30]  just let just put the record out there let the public digest it and they and they have digested it  it's not a lack of knowledge about what's going on do you think anybody out there doesn't know he took  steroids now you could put a footnote in the record book to say that the period from 1998 to 2005  is known by many with considerable justification as a steroid era and numbers posted during you know  that should be taken into account when the reader observes numbers during this period in baseball 
[03:27:00]  okay i i could go with that there you go we've also discussed there's a lot stronger pitching now  at one because again these guys babe ruth as much as i wanted him to have the record  or at least over bonds uh he didn't have to face lefty specialists in the uh seventh or eighth or  ninth inning you know he had one guy pitching a double header i agree but when you look at bay i  mean the only thing that you can do about these things is look look at him compared to the rest of  the league yeah all right you look at him like in 23 he had more home runs than like four other teams 
[03:27:30]  in the league yeah that's just right yeah i mean i mean if you you're right you could you could take  these things and you could pass them out and you could do this but you know i always like to look at  league era versus the guys era because that way you can see way obviously a pitch in 1965 is going to  have a better er you know era than a pitcher in 1931 right but go look at you know look at like  a guy like lefty grove and look look what his era was and stack it up with everything if you look at 
[03:28:00]  what babe ruth did in his time and compared it to what other baseball players did in the same in the  comparable time it's unbelievable unbelievable i mean i think he's the best baseball player ever  plus we forget how good a baseball player barry bonds was before you have a soft steroid let's go  to mark in baton rouge uh mark you got a question baton rouge mark that's it yeah hi james hey what's  going on um i'm pretty good uh even though i lean to the right a little bit uh i'm a fan of yours 
[03:28:30]  because we're uh i'm a fellow lsu graduate all right but uh i got a question i'm gonna hang up and  listen uh you're talking about the asterix and uh about barry bonds and everybody knows he did  steroids what about patrick kennedy everybody knows he knew what he was doing he got drunk he  got doped up and all this stuff but yet he says he doesn't remember anything so just kind of want  to get your comments on that i mean i don't know why we got from i don't know how does that tie in 
[03:29:00]  no and i was thinking about barry bonds you know i was you know that i the guy freaked out when he  started talking to you it said on the screen that he he want to ask you if there should be asterix in  politics too yeah that could have we could have a little fun with that but then he went somewhere  else on us he went in the rehab to mayo clinic okay i'll buy that mr carville uh good luck with the  show all right man with luke russert uh tim russert's son of course you do the sports show on xm 200 
[03:29:30]  friday's from 8 a.m to 9 a.m and then it uh encores uh all morning friday and all morning  saturday channel 200 right you get channel 200 that's exactly right you guys have a blast i envy you  every day y'all to have this kind of fun and get paid for it is something remarkable oh thank you  take care guys take care appreciate it opie and andy or anthony anthony anthony anthony all right james  carvel bye mr cavalli i like that fudgy the whale huh yeah i got a leak man oh i'll see you take a leak 
[03:30:00]  it is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze squeeze the breasts squeeze the bread no  shit real real soft almost like pudding almost like pudding yes a hot piece of air quite a handful  yeah the nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result  that's right anthony that's right you're checking out the opian anthony program on this fine whip them out 
[03:30:30]  wednesday if you don't have a wow sticker yet go to opian anthony.com i don't know are we getting more  wow stickers in i think we are finally right so you can start sending your self-addressed stamped  envelopes to hear to us here in new york city and we'll uh we'll send out the wow stickers okay so  you can participate and whip them out wednesday i couldn't stand the censorship all right here we go 
[03:31:00]  asshole we were talking about this on the first half of the opian anthony show today uh stern babbling  about how uh he had an offer to go back to terrestrial radio our spies all over the business  uh said to us that this is just not true whatsoever bullshit it's complete bullshit we did the move and  all of a sudden he comes up and said can can you people please use your head and see through this  transparent douchebag we make the move it's a smart move all the trade magazines in the business have 
[03:31:30]  been saying this is a smart move yeah and and he has to then come out after the fact of course and  say oh i already was offered uh uh the same deal he was a major deal off you didn't you did not so  now that you're not going to terrestrial radio why don't you tell us about the deal yeah who is it with  we would we we would we almost blew this deal talking about the deal that's right that's how 
[03:32:00]  stupid we are my friend he can't stand the fact that we're getting so much attention right now it's  driving him nuts and so i guess he figured he would piggyback our little story and get his uh you  know his uh his name in print and his face on the news it isn't even just this story it's other things  that you notice slowly things turn and and he notices because he's in the business we notice but  the people start noticing after a while there was a little blurb in the paper about a bit we were talking  about uh uh the uh uh fear mongering that the news does with their news teasers and just us discussing 
[03:32:30]  it made the paper now that even though we've been doing that same bit yeah 18 months on xm we've been  doing it it's just a fact of life we love xm we love the freedom we get here but right now at this  point there aren't as many listeners on satellite as there are on free terrestrial radio it's just the  way it is it's a fact of life so we we broadcast to more people and the industry people are still so  you know radio centric uh broadcast radio that that's what they listen to we talk about stuff 
[03:33:00]  it gets printed in the paper a lot more people are paying attention because we went back to uh  terrestrial right we went back it was a huge radio story right they're still debating it on on websites  and uh trade papers and magazines they want to do interviews with us and howard in the meantime  is talking about how he can't get guests like richard dreyfuss on his show the reason is richard  dreyfuss was never a friend uh arnold schwarzenegger never a friend these people came to his show because 
[03:33:30]  he had an audience now that he doesn't have that audience they are not coming to his show like they  were he's getting pissed no matter what he says he's getting jealous the fact that we're sitting in his  old studio doing a show uh to a majority of his old audience has got to annoy you hey it would annoy  the shit out of me stop one of our fans pointed out something that was pretty interesting the uh i  think it was on one of the message boards i do read them even though i'm pissed off at you guys 
[03:34:00]  uh one of the one of the guys mentioned that how weird is it that opie and anthony were playing audio  of howard stern talking about how he put a gag order on on them and they were playing the audio  from howard's old seat yeah and the and from the studio where he had the guy used to broadcast from  and from where he made that gag order i gotta tell you it was very strange yesterday to play that audio  as we were sitting in his studio in his seat sweet victory but uh i hear it was citadel it wasn't  fucking citadel no it wasn't fucking citadel you're buying the hype you're buying the hype machine you're 
[03:34:30]  buying the speculation that that these uh uh news people come up with they look at everything else  and through process of elimination they say well it couldn't be this it couldn't be this one it couldn't  be this there were so many major companies that it couldn't be right that they had to pick a company  right that didn't have some kind of major problem and meanwhile farid does have a major problem with  howard it's the reason he left infinity right oh where did i hear this did i read in the paper did i 
[03:35:00]  did i hear a gossip did i i heard it from farid's mouth the guy couldn't stand howard howard was bad  mouthing him and calling it uh bad mouthing his children right to the point where he was getting uh uh  upset that they might be threatened that's the kind of shit howard would pull and that's why farid  said fuck this and free was talking to us just a couple days ago he wants to throw us on uh  one maybe more of his stations in the very near future so yeah you know howard's just full of 
[03:35:30]  shit once again a little uh request to the ona pest just a little mission could you please blast  howard with phone calls email you guys know what to do a couple of cruise missiles you know the  websites the stern fan network all that shit and and and just ask uh honestly just ask uh well  howard if you had this huge deal with some radio company out there now that you're not going to take  the deal could you at least tell us uh who it was uh with what was it who is it what's what's there  to lose at this point he said tuesday he had been offered quote a major deal yeah let me read this 
[03:36:00]  for everybody hell is that this just hit the ap and we're all over this story uh stern says no to  terrestrial radio is the headline and the reason why he had to say no see he was fucking around and  he was he's trying to keep his name in the papers and god bless him for that he's really good at that  okay but he was teasing the fact that he had a major deal to go back to terrestrial radio  everyone that has serious stock went what what the fuck the stock is almost at a 52-week low paying you 
[03:36:30]  half a billion dollars and you're you're going to go to a terrestrial right so the stock got all uh  all shaky and then uh what's the term thanks anthony uh all uh shaky volatile volatile unsteady  unstable and all that moving so back and forthly broke its hip so we know that uh we know how mel  works mel said howard down said what the fuck are you doing you go on your fucking radio show and this  is how mel talks by the way he goes no he goes he goes he asks you a question first right yes the mel  question it's the same question that the guy at the bridge gives you in order to cross and if you 
[03:37:00]  don't answer it you're flung into the uh chasm to the abyss yeah into the abyss he says uh howard  how is it good for the stockholders to have a rumor out there that you're leaving  uh well no i i i i i i i i can't be looking looking like a fool  like an idiot that's right mel he can't look like an idiot that's right robin agrees robin agrees 
[03:37:30]  to everything right fred robin uh shoot yourself okay howard yeah so but yeah what the fuck are you  doing get on your fucking show and tell them you're not going to terrestrial radio so the stock  stabilizes a little bit here yeah you're around here and i i can't have this right now i'm paying  you a half a billion dollars and the rumor that that he he was considering it or going if you look 
[03:38:00]  at the original line that he said it's he would like to go back and kick our ass like oh wouldn't  it be nice to go back to terrestrial radio and kick our ass not that he had a deal or something  was on the table he was just fantasizing about coming back and kicking cbs's ass and making it hard  for joel and less and us and everybody else that screwed him over oh yeah nice bank account screwed  him over uh that's where it started it didn't start with a deal and then all of a sudden out of nowhere 
[03:38:30]  he comes out with oh i had a major deal that i turned down no you didn't the station of poughkeepsie  yeah there it is he didn't have any deal no deal does he'll the or no deal uh no deal no deal you  you know no deal the the fact is it's driving him nuts that we're doing uh doing both and we  love it he wasn't smart enough he wasn't smart uh smart enough to think this through the one line  figure it out here let me read it because then we can comment because there's a lot of lines in here 
[03:39:00]  jimmy stern says no to terrestrial radio so you know he had to do this and i guarantee mel told him  to do this new york forget the various rumors and rumblings howard stern made it clear made it clear  by the way that's that is such a mel thing oh you go on and not only you say you're not going  you make it clear uh howard stern made it clear wednesday morning he's staying put on satellite  radio uh a howard quote i'm very flattered terrestrial radio can't let go of me stern  said on his morning radio show but i would throw up if i had to go back i'm never going back the 
[03:39:30]  self-proclaimed uh king of all media said that three companies have made overtures through his agent  but there was no interest from his end he did not name the companies and he will not name the companies  because there are no companies stern is just five months into a five-year 500 million dollar  satellite radio contract i've never been happier stern said we're flying high and doing great you look  at every day every photo you see i have stern he looks so happy that's all that botox in his face 
[03:40:00]  looks miserable he looks miserable stern told the new york post in a story published tuesday that he had  been offered a major deal to return to regular radio what paper would cover like like that have  like the post is so biased he must have photos of those guys just blowing each other while reading  the daily news any way to get an email i'd certainly love a copy uh let's see it moves on the post  identified one of the prospective bidders as citadel broadcasting whose chief executive for reed 
[03:40:30]  solomon worked with stern for several years at infinity broadcasting until his departure for citadel in  march 2002 calls to citadel for comment were not immediately returned and they're not going to be  returned because uh you know citadel's enjoying the news it'll help their stock for a little while  press stern made his comments during an on-air interview wednesday with the ap the eternally  audacious shock jock insisted on speaking with the ap about the reports that he might consider a 
[03:41:00]  simulcasting deal where he split time between serious satellite satellite radio and a traditional  outlet hence the opian anthony deal yep it for it will be known for for uh for now on as the opie  and anthony deal that's right and in the record books and he insisted on uh talking to the ap because  mel karmazin said you make it perfectly clear today howard uh stern uh competitors greg opie hughes  and anthony kumia recently made such an agreement with cbs radio stern worked for cbs before making his 
[03:41:30]  move to satellite in january stern said this is great that opie and anthony's return to traditional  radio signified their failure on satellite that's it we are failing so badly here on satellite that cbs  decided to put us on seven stations right now you know that's how badly we're doing we we have already  uh called uh one of the top ten stations on the platform right uh we're doing huge the phones are 
[03:42:00]  constantly lit uh we go out and do appearances and there's uh loads of people like everything we're  doing here on xm signifies we're doing well i don't know how much of it we can get into but um we we have  uh a contract obviously we signed a contract and uh that contract was recently extended extended  extended so bob and everybody else that was saying that we were going to be fired he promised by 
[03:42:30]  that we would be fired by xm by october yeah um why would they then sign us to an extension on the deal  if we were going to be fired you fat howard kiss ass uh here it is uh the story is i wouldn't do it  terrestrial radio for any reason stern said not for money i left because i couldn't stand the  censorship i couldn't stand the fcc but see you know what we've been on uh regular radio for what  almost two weeks now we're having a lot of fun and we're getting a lot of laughs out there because 
[03:43:00]  and because we know how to do it we have this outlet too when we're done right there are things  that we would like to do on terrestrial that because of the circumstances and fcc you just can't  do them it's not the battle to go in and try to fight for but then you come here and we can do  whatever we want but pretty much but most of what we want to do and this is what xm guys have to  understand like it's not like we have four hours of filth being put into two hours a lot of what  we would have done we would have done the same on commercial anyway yeah except maybe it's a little  less dragged out there because we have a commercial break so instead of a 45 minute uh edmund fitzgerald 
[03:43:30]  thing we do you know 18 minutes we still got a lot of things to figure out but what i like about the  the new deal the first half of the opian anthony show we're getting right to things i like that i  like the pace and the rhythm we get in and get out of things and which is something that  strangely enough some of the same people that are bitching were uh praising about our old show  on new and that was the problem they had with the satellite show right remember that right oh they 
[03:44:00]  don't get to things fast enough they used to do this that and then they get used to the satellite  show and then get mad at the other show it's just a matter of wait enjoy right and relax scott louisiana  what's up hey guys how are y'all all right man uh yeah y'all are such failures directly you have  to put y'all back on right yeah there's another there's another one of our long list of failures  that we've had hey hey well jimmy when you coming south to louisiana man i want to get down to new 
[03:44:30]  orleans man i've never done the gig we were on there before so that's a goal for me is to get down there  to new orleans all right uh i will drive four hours to go see you if you come to new orleans all right  thank you thank you scott he really had to put out a statement here saying that he got in trouble  entertaining this he got in trouble with the stockholders and lost his mind behind the behind  uh closed doors i i really hope people because we're kind of on the inside can understand what  this means reading between the lines uh i love how you pointed that out howard stern made it clear 
[03:45:00]  wednesday morning that is something that is a press release type statement that's something you don't  want to say he said or he commented that made it clear is your boss saying you make it clear i hate  to tear down the third wall but uh wait a minute we there's two left you tear a lot of walls is it a  corner or front and back and you can run right through the middle there's gonna be a teepee because  they're gonna tip into each other only two all right well i teared down the fifth wall earlier now i'm 
[03:45:30]  tearing down the third wall so you know when you're in this position like we are and also there's rumors  out there yeah you play with it a little bit because you get as much press it gets people  chatting chatting and then it gets people talking and then you get a few articles in the paper and  and they're calling you like crazy and you you just like don't answer your phone that yeah milk it  you milk it and let a few articles come out and then at the last possible moment then guess what bam  you tell everybody the truth but howard would have loved to milk this a lot longer he couldn't because 
[03:46:00]  milk armazen told them to shut the fuck up you're getting the shareholders nervous you're  fucking with the shareholders and the stock price you go on the air wednesday morning and this is  what you're going to do we've had these conversations with milk armazen that's what happened it is so  obvious if you read this stupid article did you see the uh serious prospectus that came out who reads  those things i i had to open it up it's hysterical because i have like some some shares of the stuff 
[03:46:30]  and who doesn't well it's funny just when you get the thing to vote against mel karmazen when  you get the little proxy voting thing oh you get the proxy yeah i haven't got one of those yet just  nothing i own enough no to mel and then you mail it in uh stern said it ends here with stern said he  wanted to reiterate his commitment to satellite yeah because of the growing number of reports that  it could go back to terrestrial radio he's not being a good guy here he's he's doing what he was told  you know what the word reiterate is used in a lot when um brokerage firms reiterate their position 
[03:47:00]  on a stock you've heard that before they're reiterating a buy rating that's what they do  uh so there's words in this statement that just reek of hey idiot making half a billion dollars  get out there and push the company that's paying you i guess tomorrow on the uh cbs part of the show  the first half of the show we get to have fun with uh howard's old listeners yeah we'll do this  this exact same break tomorrow why not i have an idea i want to start a rumor what we're doing a tv 
[03:47:30]  show the tv show deal has been signed lifetime the lifetime network i'm i'm breaking the 11th wall  the lifetime network it doesn't go up jimmy norton trading what my wall thing doesn't go past nine  i have a lot of jimmy norton plays the perfect closet but he's got the only one secret  i'm not in it though i just i might when i go in to get a jacket i'll just hang out there for a 
[03:48:00]  little while that closet's barely standing who are you kidding no it's on one lousy hand  it's not just me holding a door just kick the door off no i don't want to god you look good  all right here's uh here i'll i'll tell you this some guy from i like pussy good all right  no all right here's uh here i'll tell you this because i just spoke to some guy from  the newspaper ap ap or one of them i just spoke with the philly inquirer 
[03:48:30]  there you go howard guess what what you're uh i'm just printing it out now but it's already  over the ap wire your story's already out oh good okay so let me tell booker this  uh i've been offered by three different broadcast companies to come back to terrestrial radio and i  told my audience that here on satellite radio on sirius you don't need to do it well of course not  i told the audience isn't it interesting how they need me radio does need you they do  radio always this just i'm sorry i try not to but i it does infuriate me yeah the lying sack of 
[03:49:00]  shit that he is now it was a major deal and now it's three companies what companies it ain't cbs we  know that for sure it ain't clear channel we know that for sure it what what it can't possibly be  citadel we're talking to farid now what other companies if as you go down the food chain are  gonna offer so much money to make it worth serious is wild to rent him out and here's the reality the top 
[03:49:30]  three ownership yeah chains when you go below that i mean because you've got like 1200 stations 400  stations when you get to like company number four five and six they have like 10 stations in georgia  yeah that it is that's a uh hello savannah uh i i told you i'd make it i'm on a terrestrial and  satellite uh savannah georgia i want to say hello why would you call until 104.3 though i don't understand 
[03:50:00]  that it's a what he didn't isn't a call-in done to a uh terrestrial radio show no it's booker was on  the phone yeah it's philly show it's terrestrial left free fm but isn't isn't isn't doing his own  show because he wanted people to hear it he knows better than anybody that he has so few listeners  that he's got to call terrestrial stations or uh get us which we don't care to uh talk about him to  to to get his name out there well we don't we don't give it the nice spin that he's hoping no 
[03:50:30]  it's done it's it's just they don't have the listeners they just listen we've been successful  they said we needed a million people to come with us in order for this deal to pay for itself we have  three and a half million people who are now part of our community here on satellite wouldn't it be  a tremendous step backwards to then say to those people well now we're going to be  you're not enough yeah flop in the face the reason we're valuable to serious satellite radio  is because we are exclusive to serious satellite radio right the the the fact that the terrestrial 
[03:51:00]  radio keeps offering me jobs is a very big compliment but i never go read read daddy's note read daddy's  note howie read read read read it howie read it like a good boy good boy here's your check good  boy fetch fetch your check boy yeah ass lying asshole who's sending you a private message and 
[03:51:30]  blocking baby girl's ass while i'm trying to look at it are you insane uh laser len how about by my laser  len i'm trying to stare at baby girl's anus she's wearing uh underpants under underpants and he was  blocking that exactly all right stupid instant message why don't we do some techno file before  we get out of here for the day roy laszlo's been waiting all morning long yeah you know we've been 
[03:52:00]  on one one uh tangent after another ben always tells me to show up like two hours before i even  come on there's a reason for that yeah ben is an ass usually i'm out at the electronic entertainment  expo this time of year but i decided to skip it because you pretty much know the story with uh  the playstation 3 and and then nintendo renamed their uh their console to the wii did you see that  the wii wii and the two i's stand for we all come together play a video game i did this whole press 
[03:52:30]  conference was ridiculous because it was named like the the nintendo revolution was going to be their new  platform we now it's called we call it wawa penis wii wii penis why would they change the name  because it wasn't gonna sell nintendo yeah what no one buys it i like in television myself yeah those  that coleco vision's good jimmy oh wow good games so should we be buying the uh the uh the playstation 3 
[03:53:00]  well i got my playstation 2 i've been waiting for playstation 3 what do i do well you do i go  xbox you don't what do i do well i would hold off on getting an xbox until they come out with the  version that's got the hd dvd drive in it because basically xbox can be a while though yeah it's  going to be either the xbox that's out right now or should i go playstation 3 well you have to wait  till november 17th is when playstation 3 comes oh my god when it's going to have the blu-ray 
[03:53:30]  here's my here's my issue with the gaming systems they they've crossed the point where they're  becoming too close to being computers so you might as well get a computer to play these games until  they start now and you're getting a computer that you can't upgrade to the point that you can a  computer because they want you to they don't want you upgrading a ps3 they want you buying the ps4 when  that comes out and the 5 after that so they're never going to make where you can put a bigger hard 
[03:54:00]  drive in there more memory uh uh any of the other cards that you want to put in like you can a  computer so what they're passing the point of being that convenient console game and turning into  computers yes i mean it's a fucking computer it's basically just is a computer yeah it's a computer  probably to drive sales they'll probably just release hot selling games you know on the consoles  exclusive exclusive well that's what they did um with uh one of the games that i a far cry which i 
[03:54:30]  thought was a great game when it came out uh and they released it just exclusively on one of the  consoles and i'm sitting there with my pc and my dick in my hand going i want to play far cry i can't  play it what are you playing now nothing i am in search of a game for the past like three months i've  been looking for something good if i get one world of warcraft fucking email i'm gonna punch you in the  face the game sucks on it sucks it's not fun i'm playing a great game what are you playing defender 
[03:55:00]  defender i like that one you pick up those hostages that's a good one it's one of the newer games  gentlemen godfather i haven't picked up yet but chess chess you love chess you homosexual i don't pick up  the pieces with my asshole i just like to play it oh you should oh where's my queen ha ha gotta find it  oh goody i gotta move the bishop oh they're making a big deal about the new controller for the ps3 is  gonna have like uh motion sensing technology so that when you twist the thing in the air if you're 
[03:55:30]  flying a plane and the plane will roll that trick never works all those things that came out i remember  years ago for my sega system my sega video gaming system i had this thing where you're unfolding it  it looked like two two two little laptops it looked like but they were supposed to sense the  motion of your hands and you did a boxing game and it just never worked right it stunk what we that's 
[03:56:00]  why mouse keyboard the ultimate control mouse and keyboard every time i go into an arcade and see  somebody doing that dance dance revolution i just want to throw a grenade at them do you just want to  shoot them i dance dance revolution how the fat kids uh do so they do so well how does the fat  kid overloads the sensors it's always the fat kids that are just romping on that thing stomping and  and slamming their hands down and wars and the and they get the most upset when they screw up 
[03:56:30]  right throw a big fat hissy fit at chucky cheese can i interrupt for one second indy mike if you will  indy mike is on i wonder what he wants hi guys uh i just wanted to uh looking at the clock it looks  like it's bonus time and um i want to say i'm a what they call a brainwashed uber fan and as a  brainwashed uber fan i just want you to know that you can do no wrong and so if you decide to cut out  a little bit early today because you know you went so long yesterday i'll be perfectly fine with it and  just appreciate whatever little bit of time you want to get uh indy mike well i've i'd feel bad if you 
[03:57:00]  were fine with it would you be happy with it i would be i would be so full of joy if if you  decided to cut out because you deserve that break after working so hard yesterday who are we to not  make indy mike happy he doesn't sound like an uber fan he sounds like a well-informed customer that's  true when we start using the word uber uh it's to combat the ones that are miserable with our latest move  yeah we're german uber yeah our fans are genius i think in germany they're going 
[03:57:30]  out run from super we like traded or something uber uber just sounds so much more powerful because  it's german and look at me i didn't know what you were getting at i explained the actual concept  what an ass i know all right indy mike thank you gentlemen there you go way to go mike good call  so um yeah what else we got here in the techno file as well i was checking out uh you know a lot of car  manufacturers are now looking at putting pcs in cars rather than your normal stereo and this is 
[03:58:00]  already going on in like korea and i i checked one out korea they're like hey say what you will about  the koreans but uh they love they're like unfortunately the pc always also runs the engine  it is the engine silly me i fucked that whole lineup excuse me speaking of engine  i didn't i didn't catch that there was a fuck up oh thank you i'm so not computer  the big thing over there now is you know the high speed wireless networks and you're starting to see 
[03:58:30]  it here now with that evdo and stuff like that from yeah you could drive around we see a lot of people  on pal talk driving and uh they have their camera on and what really worries me is typing yeah they're  actually contributing to the show and uh watching us and talking about what they're watching how about the  road idiot a lot of things end in mid-sentence and that's uh yeah and the screen goes fuzzy hey  looks like there's icy row i interviewed this guy and he's like yeah in car pc have uh microsoft office  on it i'm like what are you doing looking at a spreadsheet where you're going down the road 
[03:59:00]  very busy very dishonorable not to work all the time all the time let's look at powerpoint presentation  while sit in traffic they uh yeah they're they're putting the but that opens up your your listening  pleasure to mp3s and anything else that you can drop down onto your computer uh streaming could stream  uh uh internet radio stations which is one of the things a lot of people are saying that is kind of  stupid about internet radio is a lot of people listen in their cars and that takes it out because not 
[03:59:30]  a lot of people have a laptop to sit on there and get a wireless connection but as things move along and  they incorporate the computers into the cars and have the wi-fi you can then stream and we will be  part of that starting next week i'm just putting rumors out there wow that's a great rumor man remember  when uh our careers got so bad that uh we were considering doing an internet radio show at that  that stupid company in jersey internet radio we woke up and said uh uh well i i don't see computers in 
[04:00:00]  the cars so yeah we're gonna have to pass we had more listeners when we used to call each other and  just goof around when we weren't on the air than we would have with uh e yada or one of those click  radio things i'm so glad all that horse shit died down and then podcasting came back and the number of  times i get asked like hey you want to be on my radio show i'm like oh you know tell me we know where  are you because i get that like you know i'll be on a station minneapolis do an interview or whatever  and like oh yeah i got a podcast we got a couple hundred people listening that's great great that's 
[04:00:30]  like going over someone's house for a cable access show it's the same thing people got there everyone's  got a podcast what else we got on the uh technophile here um well you know you guys are always talking  about the that sex offender bit where the the news tease where they're talking about putting all the  sex offenders in one part of town one part of town could it be near you i don't know why all parents  assume that their kids are beautiful enough to be sex offender material but some parents have to 
[04:01:00]  just face the plane nobody wants to suck your little kid's cock oh my jesus why would they when there's  big a's available one city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three block area problem is it  could be right next to your house could it they're branding these mobile phones for kids with tracking  services that cross-reference the location of the kid's phone with a database of registered sex 
[04:01:30]  offenders so if your kid gets within a hundred yards of a sex offenders residence assuming that all sex  offenders just sit at home you know like a lizard waiting for a fly to go by or something we were  talking about this uh yesterday what was jimmy saying somehow in new york there's so many people  in the apartments you fucking phone me buzzing every three seconds they'll be calling you every  all right look you're walking by now cover your asshole run run run run oh you're all right 
[04:02:00]  cover your asshole run run run run run run you're all right you're right it would be like a video  game the parent having to navigate his child through the streets turn left turn left avoiding the  waka waka waka eat the pill it'll turn him into the blue ghost  how a twist on the predator law could shut down religion  i gotta believe it that's our new one that we're starting to like a lot all right pedophilia in god  out yeah right god so five minutes ago what's with the sexy female robot it's there's this uh place 
[04:02:30]  called uh kyoto's robot garage they're one of those uh robot development houses and they've decided that  robots are too masculine yeah so they have uh a feminine robot that it you know it's bipedal  which means you know walks on two legs and it's sort of sleek and stylish and walks like a fashion  model so i was kind of getting a little excited at this so i found out it's a foot and a half tall  ah can't even fuck it that's all i'm thinking is prototype is the prototype ft cunt 
[04:03:00]  you can't fuck it but if you punch it it walks back over and its little robot head dips  i the day is coming with the fuckable robot absolutely it is definitely coming women you're  on your way out i don't understand why there is still the blow-up doll that just looks like the  same one that was in any goof movie of the 70s and it's the same beloved all the technology 
[04:03:30]  real dolls still just more latex over the years what is it real doll.com yeah they've got the guy  real doll now i played a few clips of that when i did that oh jesus three weeks that guy did finish  that sentence what yeah no homo no homo not that i was interested in the but i mean you would think  by this point 2006 we'd have the ones that roam around uh you can have sex with it yeah and then 
[04:04:00]  it cooks and then it comes something oh we got our vacuum cleaners it mouths off you hit it you come  back you you want the female robots crying there's five little dead robots floating in the tub  oh my god enough about that enough about the the yates children i get them mixed up  it's all a little tweaky dbd bd why are we going backwards dbd bd bd bd hated tweaky it's not bath 
[04:04:30]  day bd bd bd bd oh and uh one last thing the uh you know i've checked out some of those those drones  that they have in afghanistan no no no before you get to that not one more last thing okay a big  fuck you to phillips yes yeah it's kind of weak i was enjoying my dvr last night matter of fact i went to  see poseidon which i i thought was a fantastic movie um and then i came home and it was like uh  i don't know like 8 45 and bedtime is like nine when we're getting up like 4 4 15. but i'm thinking 
[04:05:00]  with my dvr i think i could sneak american idol in it it was 38 minutes that i had to waste on american  idol last night thanks to dvr fast forwarding through the commercials uh lazio comes in here  with the techno file and i see that phillips has patented dvr that prevents you from skipping  commercials pieces of shit why would you buy this then why would they patent it well i can i guess  i'm gonna take certain cable companies will probably only allow their thing to be compatible with this  so why is that don't decide to be the cock blockers well the unfortunate thing that's occurring with with 
[04:05:30]  dvrs you used to be able to call your cable company or your satellite television company and get  a dvr from them you gave them two three hundred bucks you used it no problem right now they're a little  less about selling you the equipment they want to just sort of lease it to you and the other thing  that they're trying to do now is they're talking about stopping the sales of dvrs entirely and  recording it all on hard drives at their central office for you and then you'll have access to it 
[04:06:00]  so they will be able to control they've got more control over the content at that point enough here's  the thing the technology also would have a system where you can pay extra if you want to skip through  commercials this is where where they would like to go i mean patents aren't indicative of exactly  what the technology is going to be out there but you can see where they want to take it they want  more control over the content so that you're not able to record lucky louis and you got to buy the  fucking box set well what's going to happen also is they're going to start losing commercial money 
[04:06:30]  uh because of uh people fast-forwarding they're going to people to stop advertising and uh that extra money  i'd be a piece that goes to networks or how or the however the fuck it works there is nothing better  though that like opus saying when uh you want to watch a show american idol or anything and you see  that it is now you have it recording it is now 8 30 and you know that you have enough time built up  to watch the whole thing isn't it horrifying when you're watching the show and you're fast-forwarding 
[04:07:00]  through a commercial like it's live oh my god i'm not going to have enough time i'm going to have to  sit through one commercial break now you got to sit through one break and it pisses you off  or the horror the horror nightmare you roll over and hit the live button on your remote  no that's what happened with the sopranos i told the story yeah the classic story when uh  uncle junior shot uh tony there yeah oh i i hit the live button i adjust myself in bed hit the live  button to see tony on the floor and i thought i swear to god because they were cooking i thought it was 
[04:07:30]  just spaghetti sauce all over the floor and then he had a panic attack i had no idea that uh junior  shot him until the next day when we came in here can you hit reverse like in there like a 30 second  back button i don't know what i did to be honest with you i could not get it back once you hit live  you're just screw i had no i honestly have no idea what i did i get i guess i could have i think because  i changed the channel maybe but also to send up the scene and i adjust myself next thing i know i  see tony on the floor and and it's red stuff all over the place i'm thinking oh panic attack grab the 
[04:08:00]  pot of sauce as he's falling and and and that's that no no and that happens too when you change the  channel you have a lot of time built up and you change the channel and change back to the channel  you're at uh-oh oh man oh boy i missed everything you got one with two tuners you gotta get one with two  tuners yeah i have that you can switch channels yeah all right two tuners right there's one  tuner hollow why don't i have that i don't know you're gay i'm fucking two tuner jimmy but now it's 
[04:08:30]  like you know when you get that panic because your show's starting at nine now i'm like i'll start  watching at 9 20. yeah then you can watch something else let's watch something else for 20 minutes i i  watched like uh some of the you know the playoffs the nba playoffs then you don't have to watch the  whole thing then i started my show yeah you imagine having to fucking sit through commercials with a  dvr that would blow a bunch of pieces of shit i guess if they because i understand the point  you're making with commercials and people won't advertise as much and all that it's kind of like  why the music industry was fighting back because you know they were losing so much money and why 
[04:09:00]  would people put out put out albums if no one was going to buy them so i kind of got that argument  but i want the at least the choice with the dvr thing i would i would spend more money to have  the option to fast forward to commercials at least give us that option but wouldn't make us sit  through the fucking things won't people start going now now if satellite this will be a thing  too like direct tv or the other ones because you can get those uh those boxes they're not dvrs they're  tvos they may offer the option of just zipping through commercials without it so then all of a 
[04:09:30]  sudden if cable is trying to fuck you with this a lot of people just go to satellite and go you know  what go fuck yourself i'm getting a tv on a satellite system right and that could really come back to  hurt cable which would be great the xm units are great because you can fast forward through all the  garbage and they're talking about you know legislation that would restrict how much content  you can record from satellite radio yeah you've seen that stay in that pop up a few times uh over  the years they don't want you recording the whole net neutrality thing have you been following i i think  it's not so much they don't want you recording they want you can record they don't want it transferable 
[04:10:00]  to any other medium fair enough like if you have uh one of the units and you're listening and recording  something you want to listen to later you can't then plug it into your computer download it burn it  things like that and on the commercial thing did you see that episode of the sopranos like two or three  weeks ago the entire thing was like a commercial when they're walking around all those free products  a lot of product placement like 30 45 second like commercials hbo's full of product placement all of 
[04:10:30]  their original programming and it's ridiculous because yeah how do you put a buick ad in deadwood  they did it i have no and at the end of that episode they're like you know they might as well  just put something up on the end of the screen like after you shoot somebody make sure you buy  something from your airline stewardess and duty-free yeah do you see that they were like buying montblanc  pens and stuff it's like that scene really didn't make any sense it was just to get product placement  in there but where was that what scene was it sopranos when they were buying sunday not buying they 
[04:11:00]  were kind of taking sunglasses why don't we uh so the other one that i interrupted you with uh lazuli  his penmanship sucks don't even try to read it nestle quick hold on he wrote what the  far let me see what does it say nestle quick on the train set close up that was the first scene  yeah we had kind of gone through the uh yeah i think we had made a point that they did do a lot of  product uh placements hold on let me get that delay going from the international calls ladies and 
[04:11:30]  gentlemen uh it was a nestle quick uh close-up during the season premiere oh i'm not even gonna  look but i'm gonna guess what they're doing in the booth right now tell me if i'm right laughing  no they're just tired they are like they're just tuckered out they want to go home derrick just wants  to go home and put on his socks and saddles together and wonder why he looks like a hindu tourist  all right one more uh one more thing the um you you know uh in afghanistan iraq we've got those  remote control planes and those autonomous drones they just set a path and it goes in circles i sat in 
[04:12:00]  the cockpit of one of those the uh the control panel actually when i was over in iraq while you guys  were cockpit i mean there's a control there's a major a central control thing yeah i got to see the  actual drone and and sit in the uh control thing and uh yeah you know when you're over there serving  your country entertaining the troops serving your country all you boys were enjoying your  millions jet setting i was over there uh helping the boys out that's good how do you think that  predator gets paid for my friend right by um oh tax dollars right i think these two guys own 
[04:12:30]  several predators i well maybe a rivet yeah really price of those things actually they're not that  expensive and so now the companies that manufacture them are pitching the department of homeland security  and local police departments to use these and police departments are buying them and using them for  surveillance uh i think it was in north carolina they used one to do surveillance on a group of  bikers take pictures at a biker rally wow that's that's what's coming a little eerie very twilight 
[04:13:00]  zone outer limits little orb floating around with a lens on it that you gotta oh wait look out the orb is  here we are that cool we're gonna lose we really are gonna lose a lot of the privacy yeah i don't  care i'll be done by the time it happens just keep it out of my house like i don't want to see in my  house anything outside i could care well eventually they'll see infrared they'll see right to your roof  you know about the nsa uh at&t thing right that the nsa went to at&t and built a special room that 
[04:13:30]  basically has these huge computers that tap into the major communications pipes because at&t owns a lot  of the backbone where communications email stuff goes through yeah the nsa was basically had this  vacuum cleaner that was sucking millions and millions of emails a day and going right yeah  they're they're being sued by the uh some civil liberties yeah of course they're also trying to  get uh more power over this um phone over internet that's going on they need they need these people 
[04:14:00]  that are putting uh these products out to be able to let the authorities access uh their clientele and  and the calls that are being placed back and forth through these uh uh services what if they're  trying to get again there's a this is the argument people have the civil liberty i know but people are  going to use this technology the threat is no longer some guy's going to walk in and pick up a machine  gun the threat is what if there is a suitcase nuke being smuggled in right which can kill 30 or 40 
[04:14:30]  thousand people how do you combat that if not the nsa rifle they're not looking through emails for  gambling or drugs even but if they find things they've been known to yeah like drugs they have  used anti-terrorism laws to get drug dealers because uh they run it you know five degrees of separation  right they say the money goes to this guy goes to this guy goes to this guy and before you know it  it's in the hands of the terrorists three months after the same thing happens down at the deli when you 
[04:15:00]  buy a bagel three yeah you're fucked drug dealers too three months after 9 11 they were running  commercials during the super bowl saying if you smoke pot you support terrorism support terrorism  three months to to start tying that in and they've they've said that the majority of uses of the  patriot act have been for non-terrorism related all i know is when i smoked pot i couldn't support myself  so how i'm supporting terrorism all right do we uh do a game of uh i guess what's in my pants before  we leave yeah we do a quick one try to play some gets what's in my pants right away getting

[04:20:00]  We rarely go to that one.  We normally don't have to unless it's a tie.  Give me some water, quick.  All right.  Dynamite.  Okay.  If you would.  Now, I see you're sitting.  Right?  Now, don't stand up.  I stand, you'll say.  Okay.  Yeah, for God's sake, don't let us see on the camera what you're sporting, or that would ruin the whole thing.  And don't tell us until we ask you.  So, now, are your pants down?  What were you wearing?  A skirt or pants?  Why?  I was wearing shorts and panties, but both are off. 
[04:20:30]  Both are off right now, so you're sitting on that chair completely naked.  Nice.  Okay.  Now, if you would, take the phone that you are holding and rub it in an up and down fashion.  Okay.  You're good.  Let's hear.  Okay.  That's a hell of a delay, huh?  No kidding.  I, I, we, it was up by your head the whole time. 
[04:21:00]  There she goes.  Yeah, my camera kind of stinks.  Yeah.  Boy, wow, that's a, where the hell are you, Venus?  All right.  That up and down was kind of telling.  Now, let's do a side to side.  Take the phone and rub it side to side.  Got a little big A delay there going on.  One more time, side to side.  Yeah, one more time.  Quickly.  Okay.  Side to side again?  Yes, please. 
[04:21:30]  Hmm.  Okay.  All right.  Now we need the circular motion.  Just take it and, in a, over the whole area, rub it in a circle.  A few times.  Okay.  Do it a few times.  Okay.  Okay.  All right, I got it.  I got it.  I always go first, though, god damn it.  I'll go first. 
[04:22:00]  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'll say that you got, uh, just a trimmed, natural, uh, natural patch of, uh, thick, unsightly hair.  Don't, uh, don't tell him or, uh, anybody else before, um, we all guess.  So, I'm saying you got a triangle.  But I'm saying it's not like, uh, yeah.  All right.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, you're saying it's not a triangle. 
[04:22:30]  I think it's, uh, a natural, um, triangle.  So, um, let me see.  And what did, what did Opie say?  I, uh, um.  Opie.  Uh, Hitler mustache.  He's saying Hitler mustache.  Laszlo?  I'm going to go cancer pussy.  You're going, uh, completely bald.  You said, Jimmy?  I said just a lot of hair, but a cunt, but trimmed.  A lot of hair, but trimmed. 
[04:23:00]  I'm saying the natural triangle.  Um, okay, let's see.  Dynamite, if you would please tell us what is in your pants.  Show us.  Go fuck yourselves.  You and your complaints that we don't do enough show.  That's right.  Punish you, you motherfucking assholes.  She's hung up on and bounced from the room.  27 minutes is the bonus time, shit dicks.  You're welcome. 
[04:23:30]  I'm going home.  See you tomorrow, assholes.  Let's go count the money. </pre>
