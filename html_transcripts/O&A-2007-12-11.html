<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts' usual irreverent banter, including jokes about their controversial style and upcoming sick days.  Robert Kelly, filling in for Jim Norton, joins them.  A substantial portion of the show is dedicated to a heated, humorous debate between Opie and Kelly about Call of Duty 4, their online gaming personas ("General" Opie), and the game's addictive qualities.  Callers share their own experiences with the game's addictive nature and its impact on their lives, including one caller confessing a lack of sex due to his excessive gaming.

The show then pivots to a discussion of a Led Zeppelin reunion concert, featuring emotional audio clips from Bruce Kelly and a listener's review.  This sparks a debate about Robert Plant's current vocal abilities, compared to his younger self and other Zeppelin covers.  Various audio clips of Plant's performances are played and critiqued, fueling more humorous arguments and banter.  The hosts briefly touch on Michael Vick's sentencing, the potential repeal of the death penalty in New Jersey, and Kevin DuBrow's death before returning to the Led Zeppelin discussion.

The next segment begins with a discussion about the safety (or lack thereof) of the area around the Prudential Center in Newark, sparked by a comment mistakenly attributed to the New Jersey Devils' coach but later corrected to be Barry Melrose.  The conversation transitions back to the Led Zeppelin concert review, with further audio clips and debates on Plant's performance.  A caller, Pat from New Jersey, describes Newark's dangerous reputation while contrasting it with the pleasant experience near the arena.  The hosts share their own concert experiences (Anthony's attendance at Gwen Stefani and Madonna concerts), leading to jokes about masculinity and concert etiquette.  A call with a 12-year-old listener, Seth, adds to the humorous chaos.  A prank call from their Worcester days, informing a woman of her friend's death, is played.  Opie's recent marriage is briefly discussed with humorous exchanges between the hosts and a caller.  Jim Norton's arrival in the studio is noted.  More Led Zeppelin audio is played, along with "Steve Sounds"â€”listener-submitted audio clips creatively altered and incorporated into popular songs.  The segment ends with a news story about women streaking on the subway.  The segment is filled with ribald humor and sexually suggestive language.


The following segment opens with a humorous discussion of a YouTube video showing women pole dancing on a subway train, leading to speculation about similar stunts in other locations.  The hosts discuss the dancers' $10,000 prize and the MTA's understated reaction.  This is followed by a discussion of a 63-year-old woman ("Pistol Packin' Granny") arrested at Disney World with a loaded handgun, knife, and scissors.  The hosts joke about the absurdity of the situation.  Vince McMahon's apparent imitation of Anthony's "Angry Vince" style is discussed, leading to much amusement. The use of the Nintendo Wii in physical therapy is briefly mentioned.  A graphic and detailed account of one host's large bowel movement is recounted, sparking humorous descriptions and reactions. This leads to tangents about Jim Norton's upcoming appearance, an upcoming iTunes release, a staff member's accidental appearance in a TMZ video with Madonna, the Led Zeppelin reunion concert, a caller's experience at a Bob Dylan concert where the audience left early, a picture comparison of Led Zeppelin members versus Fiona Apple, and the "Cinnamon Challenge," prompting speculation about its effects and a discussion about Johnny Carson's alleged wig.  The segment is filled with off-color jokes, vulgar language, and sexually suggestive humor.


A subsequent segment features banter between the hosts and an unidentified male guest about the guest's appearance and tax bracket.  This transitions into a planned "cinnamon challenge," with concerns raised about its potential dangers and the lack of on-site CPR.  E-Rock, a studio guest, attempts the challenge and suffers a severe adverse reaction, coughing violently, experiencing breathing difficulties, and seemingly producing blood.  The hosts' reactions range from concern to amusement, with ongoing crude jokes and commentary. A caller, identified as a doctor, explains the potentially life-threatening nature of the challenge.  The hosts then play audio from a documentary on anal sex, with graphic descriptions and crude humor. The segment concludes with further discussion about E-Rock's condition, the cinnamon challenge video, caller interactions, and mentions of upcoming segments and guests, including John C. Reilly.

The final segment discussed includes calls from listeners Dan in Albany (discussing pot, abuse, and Activision stock), Courtney in Connecticut (mentioning a drug arrest), and Bob in Jersey (recommending a Tim McGraw tribute video).  A listener's complaint about Activision stealing a guitar hero song is discussed. A significant portion focuses on "Eroc," who is very ill after the cinnamon challenge, with the hosts joking about his condition, symptoms (including vomiting), and need for medical attention.  A phone call with Elo concerning the incident and Eroc's possible firing is mentioned, followed by a Grammy moment featuring Gwen Stefani and Akon.  Numerous "runner-up lines of the day" are read, and Bodog Fantasy.net is mentioned as a sponsor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infinis, DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that.  Opie and Anthony.  Catch up a baseball.  Oh, nice!  Oh, that was fast. 
[00:01:00]  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Didn't we just do this? 
[00:01:30]  Certainly feels like it.  Yeah.  I will give you that one.  Feels like I was just sitting here.  I think I was.  Hey, come on in.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Featuring Robert Kelly from robertkellylive.com.  In for the vacationing Jim Norton.  I don't know where he is.  Jimmy's going to make it.  He's landing in like 20, 25 minutes. 
[00:02:00]  At Newark, if you want to go say hi to him.  I don't give a crap.  He'll enjoy it.  And he's such an obsessed freak.  He called me yesterday.  He's like, I'll be in.  I'll be in.  I'll be in by 735, 745.  I know you got Bob Kelly coming in, but I want to come in.  I'm like, dude, why don't you just take the day off?  It's cool.  He's got the greatest schedule ever.  He comes and goes whenever he wants.  I'm like, you don't have to be here.  He goes, no, I really need to be there.  I got a guy.  I got shows.  I got a guy.  I got a guy.  I got a guy.  Amazing. 
[00:02:30]  He's a workaholic, that Jim Norton.  I guess he was in L.A. doing some business, and I'm like, just take the day off.  He's been flying all night long, and he lands, and he's coming right to the studio.  Yeah.  That's what he does.  Any other normal person would go, you know what?  I'm really tired.  I'll just take the day off.  I think that every day.  And it's nothing about how much I like this job.  I like being here.  It's fun. 
[00:03:00]  It beats working for a living.  But there's just something ingrained in me that when the alarm goes off, I start thinking  of ways to stay in bed.  Like, I think of making the phone call and going, no, I can't come in today.  I'm sick.  Lying about being sick or something.  But then I know I'd hang the phone up, lay down, not get back to sleep, and be like,  I should have went.  Stupid.  You and I are due for a sick day, wink, wink. 
[00:03:30]  Yes.  The old sick out.  When we're in cahoots together, who's going to be sick?  Is it going to be you or me this time?  And then I...  Steve, you better call Tom.  I got strep throat.  Yeah.  We're not going to be in tomorrow.  No, no.  I think I'll be in by Thursday.  Get a best of.  Just get a best of.  And we'll be, you know, I'll do the show.  Wait a minute.  Can't forget the cough. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  We're due for one, Ant.  You know that.  Oh, of course.  Because I know I'm going to jinx it now, but between Ant and I, we don't get sick that  often.  We need to get sick a little more often.  So we get a day or two here.  Yeah.  Right?  Would be nice.  Right?  It just happens.  I got...  It feels like I was arc welding with no goggles on last night.  Anybody who's done that knows that you get this feeling.  It feels like you have sand in your eyes.  That's what I have going.  Oh, you two were watching the 15th anniversary of Raw last night. 
[00:04:30]  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was playing Call of Duty 4, my new favoritest game ever.  Much to Bob Kelly's chagrin, because it is his favoritest game ever, and we can't play  together.  We can't get online and play together, because he is on the Xbox, I am on PC.  I don't understand why you would play PC. 
[00:05:00]  You're in your 40s.  It's a nice interface.  No, it's not.  It's an awful interface.  It's wonderful.  No, it's not.  Someone actually made a remote control that scientifically fits in your hand to actually  be the best way to play a video game, and you still have to hit A and W to move.  No, I remap my keys, so everything is the way it's been for the 12-plus years I've been 
[00:05:30]  playing first-person shooters.  So, it's second nature.  It becomes second nature.  Don't think it's like sitting here, and I'm going, I gotta move forward.  Let me hit this key.  It's completely second nature.  You have more options on a keyboard than you do a controller.  And secondly, let me riddle me this, Mr. Kelly.  Riddle me this.  You call me General, because you're still a private.  General Kelly.  I know.  He's a general.  Wait.  He's a general?  I'm not a private.  I'm a sergeant.  Well, you're still underneath me, so you address me.  I'm working on it.  You address me as you should. 
[00:06:00]  I'm working on it, General, sir.  You online freaks.  You don't even have a scope or a red dot scope.  You're still looking through the...  You're a stupid Robert Kelly to me.  Sometimes I pick up a gun, and I get the red dot scope.  You have to pick up someone's gun off the ground.  You have to pick up a dead, a good person.  And then I go, I hope I use this before I...  And I'm dead.  It sucks.  So, you're a general online, and Anthony's only a sergeant.  I'm actually, like, a two-star master general supremo or something. 
[00:06:30]  I'm getting there.  No, you're not.  Now, the reason...  Let me ask you this.  You have a problem with the mouse-keyboard interface with a first-person shooter game.  Why is it that they don't give you a controller to move your mouse on a regular computer?  Like, why to click on things?  Why don't you use the little controller if it's a better, more accurate movement that you get?  Okay, genius boy.  Yes.  It's because on a computer, you're basically clicking, pointing and clicking. 
[00:07:00]  You're opening files, and you're clicking X's.  On a video game, I am hunting people down.  I am crawling through grass with a sniper rifle.  You can sight in better with a mouse than you can with a controller.  This is an argument that just will never end.  Console players say they like the controller better.  PC players like the mouse better.  You get a more accurate movement of your gun than you do trying to hit those goddamn left, right, up, down buttons. 
[00:07:30]  No, you don't.  Yes, you do.  No, it's ergonomically correct.  Ergonomically.  What?  I will give you that people do get used to any interface and play to the best of their ability with it.  But I will get on Xbox with a controller.  I'm going to buy the game for Xbox so I can play with the general.  They really could put it on a banana, and we'd get used to it.  Yeah, after a while, you'd be like, no, I play with the banana.  What do you use?  Oh, a keyboard?  Wait, what are you, stupid?  Use the regular controller? 
[00:08:00]  What do you need?  Wait, no, the banana is the best interface.  Banana.  You really would get used to that.  You would.  You'd just be kicking ass with a banana.  And, Robert, what you've got to understand, too, Anthony has the Mac Daddy system.  He's got, like, he's got ridiculous, massive fans that have to, like, you know, cool down his system.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  And I got a huge monitor and just it's a graphics card.  I turn everything on full.  I just, I want shadows.  I want ripples in water.  I want lighting effects. 
[00:08:30]  I get all that crap on there, and it works really, really nicely.  It makes it for a good gaming experience.  Basically, what Anthony's trying to say, he has cancers in his body that they haven't even discovered yet.  No, God forbid.  That's how much power is shooting out of his system.  I want an immersive game.  Walmart.  You could run Walmart with your computer.  Yeah, I like an immersive game like that.  I just can't, you can't even, do you play on a big screen or do you play on, like, a 17-inch monitor?  On a big screen.  17-inch?  What do you play on? 
[00:09:00]  I play on my Mac 30-inch monitor.  What's the matter with you?  I just can't, I just can't picture you just sitting there.  And I'm five inches away from it, so I'm getting a tan and my eyes are turning into prunes.  And when you're five inches away from a 30-inch monitor, that's like looking at a wall TV.  No, I play on PC, but I use the Mac monitor.  I use the big Mac monitor that I have.  But I was, me and Bobby, I'm like, I'm loading it up. 
[00:09:30]  This is cool.  I'm doing the training mission.  Wait a minute, stop.  This is over, like, a four-day period.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're texting back and forth.  I'm real excited about playing.  Very excited.  So, finally, he goes, Jan, I go, I'm on the server.  I'm, like, ready to roll.  Me and Bobby, finally, General Bob.  I'm going to be in there kicking ass with the general, and we're going to play together.  He goes, I go, what server are you on?  How do we hook up?  He goes, okay, hit the big red, like, Xbox button on the controller, and I just sat there 
[00:10:00]  looking at the text going, oh, no, oh, no, he's on Xbox.  I'm on a PC.  I don't think we can play.  So, I type it in.  I'm going, you're going to think I'm an ass, but I'm playing on PC, and just a string of  curses and insults from General Bob as he just lambasts me and calls me, questions my  sexuality, he just, he calls everything into question.  Why do you always have to question someone's sexuality when they do something wrong? 
[00:10:30]  Because buddies do that.  I know.  They use the big F word that we can't use, the F word for your sexual preference if you're,  you know, you call off kilter with the norms of society.  You call up your friend, dude, I can't find this bar.  These directions are wrong.  Oh, you're such a fan.  Oh, you must enjoy the company of men.  Right.  What happened?  I just got lost.  Yeah, chill out, dude.  I'll be there in a few minutes, man.  Don't need to go down that road. 
[00:11:00]  You made me sick.  I came home from being away.  I haven't seen my girl.  I come in.  I push her face.  I just pushed her face.  You mushed her aside?  She walked in.  She goes, can you?  And I just pushed it.  And I ran over to the couch.  I turned my 42-inch plasma on.  Nice.  I hit my Xbox button.  And I'm sitting there in front.  My bags are right next to me.  The dogs are looking at my face.  I'm shooing them off.  And I'm like, I'm going to play Anthony online right now.  We're doing this right now. 
[00:11:30]  And I was excited.  I am picking up the game today.  And I, because I have Xbox.  I got the big screen TV.  Good.  And I am picking up the game.  Let it be known that some intern will have to go out and get me the Xbox version today.  Because I need to play Bobby Kelly tonight.  But you're going to suck.  Because you're not going to be able to figure out the Xbox.  I'm going to suck.  I'm going to be back to a private again.  Just listen to me.  You better listen.  When we're in there, you listen to me.  I listen to you. 
[00:12:00]  I'll listen.  You know my clan name.  What's your clan name?  It's G.  Everybody on the thing has clan names.  Yeah.  And the three or four letters in front of their name.  Right.  And they all join the room.  And you can tell they all play together all the time.  So there's a bunch of O&A fans.  And we play together all the time.  And our clan name is G-A-A-Y.  We're very supportive of the other team.  I bet they are.  I swear to God.  When we win, we're like, listen, Red Dragon, you did good.  You're very, you know, you tried your hardest. 
[00:12:30]  And that's all you can do.  That's great.  You know, you're very nice.  You might be a general online, but you're still a private as far as the O&A show goes.  He's somebody online.  He's a general.  For God's sake.  Look at him.  General Robert Kelly.  I didn't know we were hanging with a general guy.  I know.  That's what Anthony said.  He goes, at least you're a somebody online.  Amen.  People don't give a crap about their regular lives anymore.  This is a, who knows how many, but there's millions of people out there that have given 
[00:13:00]  up on their regular lives.  Yeah.  They'd rather be a general online than a loser in real life.  I, uh, I've, and I've been, I've been going for the objectives.  Like, I'm not one of these guys hanging out doing stuff.  I run for the objective, you know, and I, I get killed a lot, but I'm going for the objective.  And a lot of times I've gotten my, um, three kills in a row.  I haven't done more than that.  I know you're probably on a five body bender, 10, whatever, 10, without getting killed. 
[00:13:30]  The fifth, this is the worst.  Get out of here.  Listen to me.  Dane was over my house for Thanksgiving.  We switched to his.  Dane, let's see.  How long did it take?  15 minutes.  Okay.  Just, just wondering.  He's the only friend I have.  What are you going to do?  So like, Patrice, it's not like my doorbell rings ever.  You know what?  I can actually take my doorbell off.  If you're, if you're only going to have one friend, Dane Cook, that's pretty impressive.  Yeah, he's a good friend.  That's probably equal to at least 20 or 30 regular friends.  That's pretty good, Bob. 
[00:14:00]  He actually came over to my house and we switched over his name because I ranked up  and we wanted to rank him up a little bit.  I got a 15 kill spree in a row, but it went on his game of cards.  So if you look at his ID, it says highest kill in a row, 15.  15.  What did you find a good spot?  You must have found a good spot.  You couldn't have been running around.  Listen, I was, I was actually in the hardest map of the game.  It's basically, you know, a 20 by 20 cube and you have to go in the middle to, to capture 
[00:14:30]  the base.  I sat there with a saw with a red dot scope and just took out everybody.  Jesus Christ.  Just took out 15 in a row.  I got three.  I felt all good about myself.  My door knocked and an Asian lady came over and gave me a back rub.  I had 15 kills.  Let's go to Keith in Jersey city.  Keith, what's up?  Oh my God.  This game is the most addictive thing that's ever been created.  Yeah, it really is.  Why is it addicting? 
[00:15:00]  Why this game?  Let me, let me, let me explain why.  And I know, I know this cause I played so many goddamn games before.  First of all, it just looks great.  The play is great.  Uh, the weapons, fantastic.  Uh, but here's where they get you.  That most first person shooters don't get you.  It's a leveling system.  Now, a lot of the, uh, uh, role playing games, the, um, uh, fantasy games like EverQuest  and World of Warcraft, they have levels that you step up and that's what keeps you there  going.  I just need to make the next level. 
[00:15:30]  This, I've never seen a first person shooter that has this leveling system where, like I  said, I'm Sergeant now, but I don't want to be a Sergeant.  I want to be the next level up because it unlocks other weapons for you and other accessories  for your weapons and, and goodies that you, that you can get makes you a better fighter.  And you get a little emblem.  You get a little emblem.  Yeah, a little emblem.  I want the ruby inside of an eagle with a star.  See?  And that's what gets you.  The stupid leveling system is addicting.  It's what keeps you there going. 
[00:16:00]  It keeps you from going to bed and you, you look and you go, all right, I can, one more,  one more round.  I'll do one more room here and, and I, I think it'd give me enough points to level up.  But the leveling system actually goes on, you, you get ranked up as, as far as your,  who you are in the game, what type of symbol you have when you go into a room, but you  also don't get this gun until you get to that level.  Yeah.  And then you got to play that gun.  You got to level up on that gun.  So you have to play that crappy gun and get 25 kills to get a scope and then to get a silencer 
[00:16:30]  to make that gun good.  So there's, there's levels on levels on levels.  And then some of you need like 200 headshots to like get this one gun.  So it takes a while, you know, but so if in the beginning, you're just running around  with this crappy gun, just getting shot up by these guys with these leet guns, it's just  a mess.  I pick up one.  It's got a red dot.  I'm like, Oh, I got a red dot.  This is fantastic.  I take three steps.  I'm just exploded by a grenade.  No more red dot gun.  But the best, one of the best features of the game is called martyrism, which, uh, 
[00:17:00]  Oh yeah.  Martyrism.  If you get killed, if someone shoots you, uh, you drop a grenade, dude, I hate it.  I hate it.  Best ever, dude.  I hate the martyr.  Uh, wait, wait, wait.  So you die system.  Hate it.  And you drop a grenade as you're dead.  A grenade drops when you're dead.  Right.  Most guys usually just run by the guy.  You can't just run by a guy after cause he'll drop a grenade and you, you can see him cause  you're dead and you see the guy running, just boom.  And then you get five points.  Just shoots up on you. 
[00:17:30]  It sucks.  I get taken out so many times.  I get a great kill on somebody.  And because they just happen to, you know, have this thing turned on where they drop a  grenade.  Oh, it sucks.  I've gotten as much as a 19 kill streak.  19 kill streak.  20, real close to 20, but never quite.  Uh, yeah.  That's hard.  Hey Keith, are you a general, uh, online?  I've actually, uh, I've gone through, uh, three times already.  All right.  You get all the way to the end and then you start over again and you get a different 
[00:18:00]  emblem.  Yeah.  But what job are you getting ready to go to work to?  I have to wake up worse than y'all.  I wake up at three in the morning.  To do what?  Uh, I cover the Europe, uh, MTV.  So.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, wow.  We're on there at night.  We're on there at night.  Look at me being an idiot.  See?  Wait a minute.  It's not a crappy job.  No kidding.  I thought, well, I, uh, you were hoping for the worst, weren't you?  I got to pick up garbage in Jersey city later today.  I have an export, import, export business for, for France and most of them. 
[00:18:30]  I'm trading diamonds in, in, in Shanghai.  I don't know.  Look at me.  I'm in a Shanghai.  Shanghai.  That's where you go to do your deals.  Yeah.  Your gem deal.  Indiana Jones.  In a wooden boat with a weird sail.  I want to talk to this Jason guy in Jersey.  He says he has Xbox and he plays against PC.  Really?  I've, I've heard of this, but I couldn't figure it out.  Hi, sir.  What's up, Jason?  Hey, boys.  What's going on, boys?  Now, uh, what are you doing there playing? 
[00:19:00]  Well, I play like, you know, I play, uh, like Team Fortress 2 against people on Vista or  whatever, and anybody I encounter with a mouse and keyboard dude gets owned.  There's no, there's no way around that, bro.  Oh, stop.  Thank you.  Just stop.  You know, you could say that.  You could say whatever, but just stop.  It's serious.  No, it's not.  All right.  Also, I'm a seventh prestige on Call of Duty 4.  I want to give a shout out to my clan, the Dome Rapers.  Yeah, well, you come and play the G-A-A-Ys, and we'll see what happens.  And I'm actually, I'm actually lowercase, because I'm just, I'm actually bi. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, okay.  As long as that's, I didn't know that was settled by lowercase letters.  Let's go to Ricky in Pennsylvania.  Ricky.  What up, guys?  Hey.  Dude, this game is like crack.  It's horrible.  I cannot stop playing it.  And, Bob Kelly, I whooped you so hard last night, dude.  Did you really?  Oh, yeah.  You played against the, my clan?  The gays.  I played against the gays.  The gays. 
[00:20:00]  But when you did, didn't you, you whipped us.  We were very polite and gracious.  We were like, you know, you guys are really good.  No, you guys, no, you guys ended up leaving the game early.  That's what you did.  Well, we had to go dancing.  Does your clan look good in their uniforms?  Oh, we're fed-tastic.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Ricky.  We got to take our first break.  It's Call of Duty 4.  A lot of people are just tuning in and going, what game are you talking about?  It sounds cool.  Call of Duty 4.  All right.  It's great.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A. 
[00:20:30]  How many hours a day?  The longest I've played, I played from 4 in the afternoon to 5.30 in the morning.  Oh, my God.  And the look of disgust on my girl's face when she heard the TV going off at 5.30 in the  morning.  The look of disgust on her face.  She's probably going to leave me because of this game.  I'm not even joking.  Because she doesn't mind if I play for a few hours.  Yeah.  But, like, I'm literally talking about this in therapy. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, you're just completely engrossed.  You're there for hours, days.  I haven't had sex in two and a half weeks.  I swear to God.  The time we're supposed to be having sex.  I actually went to bed and my girl was in, you know, that sexy outfit.  Yeah.  She actually went downstairs, took a shower, got into an outfit, went to bed because I  told her I'd be down in an hour.  Went to bed thinking I was going to put the game off, go down, and I was going to have  a little present.  And I went down, she was, like, she was all fresh, and by the time you came to bed, she 
[00:21:30]  already had morning breath.  She just looked so sad in this cute little outfit, lying in bed with the covers off.  She was probably cold for, like, two hours.  She's just snoring away and drooling.  She came up on you hours ago.  You come to bed, you're blinking, you're just seeing soldiers rushing at you.  Does that happen to you?  Yeah.  When you're out in the world, do you, like, oh, this is what I do if this happened right  here's what I would do.  I'd take cover over there and start shooting.  We've discussed that over the years. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  I guess that's how we start today.  Fine.  We've got lots to do, man.  We've got lots of stuff.  We've got more Martini Steve remixes that the fans sent in.  We've got some interesting things happening in the world.  We're going to organize and continue in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, this is perfect.  Last night was the Led Zeppelin reunion concert in front of 20,000 fans. 
[00:22:30]  It finally happened.  Who's playing drums?  Jason.  He is?  Jason Bonham.  Yeah.  John's kid.  John's kid's probably 50, though.  He's not a kid anymore.  He probably is older than John Bonham was.  Oh, easily.  I got a communique from our pal Lou Brutus, who was over there. 
[00:23:00]  Where was it?  London?  It was across the pond somewhere.  He didn't tear up like our buddy.  Bruce Kelly.  Bruce Kelly.  At the Hoosie.  Absolutely crying over here.  All right.  Now I've got to play the Bruce Kelly.  See what you did?  He's great.  For the people that don't linger longer now, I've got to bring him on board.  Absolutely crying over here.  This is Bruce Kelly.  He works, or did work for XM.  And what was it?  What show was it?  Live Aid?  I think it was Live Aid and The Who got back together for the 20th time in the last 20 years. 
[00:23:30]  No real big surprise there.  It's not like a Led Zeppelin reunion.  The first time these guys played in how many years?  20-some odd years.  How many years has it been?  Was it 20-something?  At least 25 years, right?  At least.  When did John Bonham die?  1980?  81?  Travis, help me out.  How many years?  What?  28 years.  28 years!  Anyway, so Bruce Kelly from XM, he goes over to Live Aid and Big Huge, you know, concert 
[00:24:00]  or whatever, and The Who performs.  And then he has to go on the radio and kind of, you know, help the broadcast.  And this is what he does.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under the phone logs.  You know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey perform these songs after  all these years and still have the full spirit of what they do under control. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video.  Yeah, the video was very powerful.  Yeah, yeah, that was...  This is very awkward.  I'm sorry, but it was just...  I mean, you know, it's just The Who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with The Who.  And that's it. 
[00:25:00]  I'm sorry.  You were seeing them live, I guess.  That was in color?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were live on stage, but the black and white was happening on the big screen, too.  So there's two more to go here at Hyde Park.  I'm like an idiot.  I'm sorry, really.  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  That's what this...  You know, that really is what this is all about.  There are certain moments that touch everybody.  Yeah.  The other voice in there is a great broadcaster, George Taylor Morris.  And he was like, oh, jeez. 
[00:25:30]  Well, anyway, there's more to come here.  He's like, what is wrong with this guy?  You're still crying in radio.  Get off of the cry, baby.  Right.  Just kind of tries to move on.  Well, anyway.  So Lou Brutus was over there.  And great reviews coming in for this reunion concert.  First time in 28 years.  Set list really fast.  Good times, bad times.  Started the show.  Went into Ramblin, Black Dog, In My Time of Dying.  These are like the songs I have on my iPod to represent Zeppelin, by the way. 
[00:26:00]  They did a good job at the set list.  For Your Life.  Trampled Underfoot.  Nobody's fault but mine.  No quarter.  Since I've Been Loving You.  Dazed and Confused.  Stairway to Heaven.  Song Remains the Same.  Misty Mountain Hop.  And the set ends with Cashmere.  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  I heard a little bit in the background of them playing from 1010 Winds on my way. 
[00:26:30]  I was listening to the news.  And three octaves lower, he's singing it.  It's just, I'm sorry.  It's not Zeppelin.  Robert Plant just, and they were saying, oh my God, it was amazing.  I don't think people understand that.  And you decided because you heard Zeppelin in the background on a news channel for what?  10, 15 seconds?  Yeah.  And you're making all these assumptions.  All I was listening for was Robert Plant and seeing if he's hitting those notes, and he's not. 
[00:27:00]  I got to agree with Anthony, man.  Did you see the show, Bob?  No, but I saw...  You're going to get caught up in the moment if you're there.  I saw them.  They got back together before this for like a second.  No, they didn't.  Yeah, they did.  Back in the day.  Well, Page and Plant maybe doing something, but this is the whole band, technically.  Well, not really.  What do you need a...  Who cares about a bass player?  Well, that's a good point.  What is he adding? 
[00:27:30]  The bass?  Yeah.  You're insulting a lot of bass players out there.  Yeah, well, come on.  Well, it's just that his voice...  And then he adds extra stuff that isn't in the original song.  Oh, that's all the...  I got a communique from a guy that was there.  You didn't even see the show.  I saw him perform a long time.  Her set ends with Cashmere.  Then the first encore was Whole Lotta Love.  Second encore was Rock and Roll Showover. 
[00:28:00]  After a little over two hours.  And this is what he writes.  Uh-huh.  Overall, an incredible show.  The first three numbers suffered very slightly from some microphone feedback.  A less than stellar house PA mix and what appeared to be the band taking a bit of time  to find their footing.  For the fourth song on, it was full steam ahead, and they continued to pick up momentum until  the end.  Once they found their groove, it was obvious that they were enjoying themselves immensely.  Well, that doesn't mean anything.  The crowd was riveted from the moment the lights went out. 
[00:28:30]  Because it's sapling.  As the show opened, the air seemed to go out of the arena, and it almost seemed like  the 20,000 attending were in a slight state of shock at the sight of the band finally  playing.  A simply breathtaking night.  Very well played.  Absolutely crying over here.  With exciting, musical, and emotional moments.  Wow.  That's Lou Brutus who was there.  Didn't say anything about them sounding amazing.  I didn't hear one thing in that review.  I heard they seemed happy to be there. 
[00:29:00]  It was amazing.  They get part of history.  The crowd was amazed to see them.  I didn't hear they sounded amazing.  It was Led Zeppelin.  No.  I would have loved to have been there.  And Plant always adds that extra.  You know, when you hear nobody's fault but mine, it's like, you want to hear that the  way it was done, nobody's fault but mine, you know, and then he'll always add, nobody's  fault but mine.  Shut up.  I know.  You just messed it up. 
[00:29:30]  I'm singing along, and you made me stink.  I just want to hear what I know.  He's guilty of going off track more than most bands.  Yeah.  He's like the Dave Matthews band.  They just go off on their own little thing for an hour and a half.  He, you know, he can't hit the notes anymore.  I know that.  But, you know, don't sell it like he can.  That's what they do.  And then he goes on, been a long time, been a long time, been a lonely, lonely, lonely,  lonely, lonely, lonely time.  Sounds like Harry Connick Jr.  Yeah.  Boop-a-da-bow. 
[00:30:00]  Swing low, sweet chariot.  I think Anthony was going more for a Herman Munster there.  Lily, Lily, it's been a long time, Lily.  Hey, where's Grandpa?  Robert Plant.  I'm now singing for Zeppelin, Lily.  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  Eddie.  Maybe, maybe. 
[00:30:30]  Maybe he's a little lower than he used to be.  Yeah.  He's a crooner now.  He's not Herman Munster low.  He is.  No, he's not.  He really is.  I want to hear those high notes.  Hey, I'm not a big fan of reviewers in general, but the reviews have been really good for this.  Because it's Zeppelin.  That's all.  Just to sit there and see them.  Yeah.  They don't have to play.  They could stand there like when you go to the Museum of Natural History, you see the Mastodon. 
[00:31:00]  It doesn't have to move.  It doesn't have to go.  It's just got to stand there and you're in awe.  Yeah.  They're like looking at a Mastodon.  You're going to be amazed regardless.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, what's up?  First of all, I wanted to say how ironic it is that men with the last name of Kelly cry very easily at things.  Why don't you come down to the Lakewood Theater on Friday night and say it to my face? 
[00:31:30]  I would, but I live way here in Dallas.  Why don't you come to Dallas, Bobby?  We love you down here.  Friday night, baby.  Lakewood Theater.  Go to Ticketmaster.com.  I really don't want you to fight.  I just want to get a plug in there.  He said he's going crazy down by the Lakewood Theater.  Anyhow, I think the guy from Great White did a better job hitting him high notes like on Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:32:00]  I can't remember his name.  There are so many singers that do Zeppelin better than Robert Plant does.  Yeah, and he's also a better mass murderer than Robert Plant, too.  I don't think he started the fire.  I don't acknowledge Great White.  Why don't you like Great White?  Ah, they took out a couple hundred people.  That's why.  David Coverdale did a better Robert Plant than Robert Plant did.  Great White, the club show up there in Rhode Island.  Oh, yeah.  He's a singer from Tesla.  He did a pretty good Robert Plant.  I think David Coverdale actually did a great Robert Plant. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, why don't we get some of these great Robert Plants?  I don't like his Tommy Lee Jones scenes.  It's so easy to say David Coverdale does a great Robert Plant.  Give me an example.  Give me an example of Great White doing great Zeppelin.  What?  We'll give you a little taste.  All right.  Get some Great White doing Zeppelin.  It's amazing.  Don't mess with Robert Plant.  I met the man.  Robert Plant.  I met the man.  He's got a massive head.  Biggest head I've ever seen in my life.  And it's true.  Frank from Long Island says it. 
[00:33:00]  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Hey there, Frank.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Anthony.  Yeah.  It's difficult for you to criticize Robert Plant when he lost his voice during the beginning  of a 73 tour.  Yeah, I know.  If you go back and listen to the old bootlegs, the first few days, he can nail over the hills  and far away.  After that, he can never do it.  Yeah.  Hey, the guy had a very special voice.  Special.  You know what?  Any artist that goes into the studio these days, and I'm using the term artist very loosely, 
[00:33:30]  but they go into the studio and everybody criticizes, and well, they should, and they  go, wow, that's all studio tricks.  She sucks.  She can't sing.  He can't sing.  But they put out an album.  That's what happened with Led Zeppelin.  He gets in the studio.  He can sing one line, sit down, drink honey and warm water for three hours, and then  sing the next line.  And then he goes out on tour, and it doesn't sound right.  No, he, I actually.  Am I so angry? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, why are you so angry?  I'm so angry about this.  He could sing good back in the day.  He was great.  He still is great.  It's Robert Plant.  It's Zeppelin.  He is the mastodon.  What if Opie's going to cry if he goes to the concert?  Oh, send them to the photogs.  Shut up.  Hey, there's Kelly.  Anthony, there's not a, put the game down for a second.  I've got to talk.  Oh, my God.  I don't acknowledge emo bands, but there's not a band alive that doesn't say that Zeppelin  was an influence. 
[00:34:30]  It's also, guys should know that they tuned everything down at half.  Exactly.  Jones went out and had special bass and built, so he'd have a deeper fret.  Tune everything down.  That way, he can sing the song.  And how would that sound?  And how would that sound, Anthony?  Uh, uh, been a long time since I rock and roll.  Been a long time since I rock and roll.  Oh, my God.  Don't even start, Ed.  You need...  You need... 
[00:35:00]  No, he doesn't do that.  He doesn't do that.  Hope he does it better.  Oh, I can hit a high Zeppelin.  I can hit a high Zeppelin.  Ah, let's go to Ed.  Ed on Long Island. 
[00:35:30]  Let's go, Ed.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I used to have to play Kingdom Come back in the day.  Where are some of the goddamn songs?  I say F Kingdom Come.  Thank you.  Play Get It On.  Play Get It On.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I love the garlic butter saw.  I was saying that last night. 
[00:36:00]  I couldn't get it out of my head.  I just kept saying it over and over and laughing every time.  Silly E-Rock.  I love the garlic butter saw.  Here's Grey White doing Zeppelin.  All right.  Give me a little taste.  Grey White.  Right away.  This is what you want to hear when you see Zeppelin. 
[00:36:30]  Holy Jesus.  Listen to this.  Let's hear it when he kicks it in.  This kicks ass.  See, that would rule.  That was Zeppelin.  Hey, man.  God damn, that kicks ass. 
[00:37:00]  Holy Jesus.  Why don't we wait until we get some audio from the big reunion concert?  Yeah, let's put this on back to back.  And is this live?  Or is this studio?  This is live.  This is studio.  Great White doing someone else's music.  Listen to it.  It sounds live.  Dude, that sounds live.  This is live.  Tribute CD.  Yeah, whatever.  Let me hear this one more time.  I got...  Robert Plant wishes he could sound like this. 
[00:37:30]  Come on.  Tonight, you've been Scott.  So we're real on your ruins.  This is trust and we're the biggest fan of our movie.  That's Robert Plant.  Turn this off. 
[00:38:00]  Turn this crap off.  Turn this crap off.  Always sleeping.  Stretching out, Lily.  Oh, I want one piece of this live show.  Was there one idiot there with a cell phone?  Anything.  I want a piece of this live show.  I want to hear what he sounded like.  What do you got there, E-Rock?  Oh, photos.  Well, I can't really hear a photo.  We're doing a radio show, yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Pop up a picture of some garlic butter saw.  He's got his jeans pulled up to his nipple line.  He's got a camel tie.  That's great.  Let's go to Chris in Bayside.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Actually, this is the second coming of this arrangement because they did the same thing  with Jason Bottom at the 40th anniversary of Atlantic Records.  Thank you.  They did three songs on that one.  Oh, my God.  And they followed.  Jason Bottom was following Jimmy Page. 
[00:39:00]  What is this bit of trivia?  This who gives a flying F trivia.  Hey, I'm looking at photos.  John Paul Jones looks like your father.  You see how normal he looks?  He looks like a normal old guy.  Yeah.  All the old rock bands, guys look like that.  It's hysterical.  You see the picture in the paper.  Hey, Westbury. 
[00:39:30]  The Moody Blues are playing.  And you look at the guys.  It's like, these are those acid guys?  They all look like old vicars.  Let's say, hey, wait.  We have an example of Robert Plant doing some Zeppelin.  He did Zeppelin for XM about a year ago.  So it's not that old.  Yeah, but that's different.  Why?  Because it's not.  It's his voice.  It's not up there on stage doing Zeppelin with the rest of the band.  Why don't we listen to it?  Let's listen to a piece and then decide.  All right. 
[00:40:00]  Billy on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Billy.  All the flags up and putting me in the mood for a little rock scream.  It is Rock Scream Tuesday.  What do you got?  In honor of Zeppelin, let's go.  Zeppelin rock screams today.  Nice.  That's what it sounded like.  I liked it.  Screeching tires. 
[00:40:30]  He sounds better than Robert Plant.  I got an example of Robert Plant singing.  This is not even a year old.  Maybe around a year old.  Go ahead.  I want a whole lot of love.  I want a whole lot of love.  I want a whole lot of love.  What is wrong with this?  All right.  If you heard this. 
[00:41:00]  That's wrong.  Where's the high part?  Oh, good job.  Where's that?  No.  Way down.  Where's the high part?  Way down inside.  Gonna give you my love.  Robert.  Yeah.  Yeah, he can do this.  And this isn't even.  Where's the high part?  I want a whole lot of love. 
[00:41:30]  Oh.  Well, here, now comes 800 minutes of...  Why? This blows. 
[00:42:00]  Just to hate live Led Zeppelin, actually.  No one likes it.  You ever watch The Song Remains the Same?  Oh, God. It certainly does.  Over and over and over.  Oh, God.  What are they?  Yeah, they're making some coffee.  They got a cauldron on stage. 
[00:42:30]  All right. Way down inside.  You need...  All right.  All right.  You still need more of that.  He's riffing.  Wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel.  They're still mixing their brew.  Come on already.  Bongo action? Come on.  Self-absorbed.  Oh, crap. 
[00:43:00]  Sitting in the...  What are you doing?  You're sitting there going, yeah!  Yeah!  No, no, no.  You were really...  I don't think you were ever a Zeppelin guy is the problem.  No, I like old studio Zeppelin.  Were you a Zeppelin guy?  Nothing ever live.  Nothing ever live.  Right.  Randy Jackson from Zebra does better Zeppelin.  I'd probably give him that, too.  All right, listen. 
[00:43:30]  What's going on and on?  Sounds like someone spilled something in the board.  That's exactly the sound it makes when somebody spills coffee in the board here at the radio station.  Oh, my God.  Enough of this.  You're losing me now.  It's just self-gratifying.  A few.  It doesn't...  A few.  Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.  It's cool.  This is just awful now.  It's Spinal Tap.  They've gone into Spinal Tap where he takes the violin out and tunes it and plays it with his foot. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  Plays the guitar with it.  What is this now?  Playing a who song?  What happened?  I'm crying over here.  Know what the beauty of this is?  These are just studio musicians that are helping out Robert Plant for this performance.  Yeah.  They don't get the gig.  No, so why give them all this time?  All right.  To catch his breath.  Do we give up on this or what?  Yes.  We just want to hear the...  Because he's not going to go way down inside. 
[00:44:30]  We just want to hear the...  Way down inside.  You ain't going to hear that.  Or you're going to hear him, like, squeaking it out.  But then he won't do the hype.  Yell.  Where are we?  Hello?  Dell customer service?  Oh, boy.  You lost me, too, now.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's Yoko. 
[00:45:00]  Sounds like Yoko.  Oh, finally back to the song.  All right.  Should we give up on this or what?  Well, now he's keep a coolie, baby.  Keep a coolie, baby.  All right. 
[00:45:30]  We're losing our audio.  Yeah, of course.  No one wants to hear this.  I'd hear this.  I would love this part in concert, absolutely.  Would you?  The mixing of the brew and the cauldron, though, has got to go.  Is he going to do it now?  I hate this.  Can we just cue it up to that part?  Here he goes.  All right.  Here we go.  Finally.  Hold on.  All right.  Sounds like James Brown. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, get off.  Just.  What was that?  Sounds like his Mexican lunch is starting to come off. 
[00:46:30]  There it is.  There it is.  Oh, but that's probably old.  I don't know when that is.  When is it?  Is it last night?  Is there audio?  Yeah, we'll get audio.  Get that audio.  I need a one note.  There's a bunch of clips on YouTube already.  All right.  Well, get us.  Quick.  Oh, God.  Do I need to hear that?  All right.  Listen.  Oh, he stinks on ice.  We got to take a quick break and continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:47:00]  Robert Kelly.  Robertkellylive.com.  Sitting in with us today.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  Lots to do.  Let's go to the phone.  Say hi to Dennis in Boston listening on BCN.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  I got a rock stream for you.  Okay.  I'm Robert Plant style.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear it.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I didn't realize. 
[00:47:30]  Ah.  Let's go to Toronto.  Todd, what's up?  He wants to do the same thing.  A Robert Plant rock scream.  Go ahead, Todd.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  You ready?  Yep.  Oh, that's funny.  He just does one stupid low note.  I thought he was going to say, let's get ready to rumble.  Oh, that's good.  Hey, uh, before we go back into the Zeppelin thing, we have a, uh, a Grammy moment for everybody. 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  Grammys, uh, what?  Around the corner at this point?  When are the Grammys?  February.  Okay.  A couple months.  We're doing our own little Grammy thing here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't they need writers for that?  Does that fall into some different thing?  I guess.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  They'll figure it out.  I don't care.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Record of the year.  Beyonce.  Irreplaceable.  You must not know about me.  You must not know about me. 
[00:48:30]  I could have another you in a minute.  Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute.  Baby.  You must not know about me.  You must not know about me.  I could have another you by tomorrow.  So don't ever for a second get to think.  In your irreplaceable.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  The Grammy Awards, February 10th at 8 p.m. on CBS. 
[00:49:00]  Why are we turning it into a commercial at the end of that?  Of course.  It's a radio bit.  Commercial for the company.  Yeah, commercial for the company.  This is our little bit.  You don't have to tag it with commercial crap.  People are going to watch the Grammys.  Don't worry.  That's funny, though.  The company.  We got a new one today, by the way.  We played that yesterday.  We got Roland doing some Gwen Stefani.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, we'll do that later.  That's a good one.  All right.  Well, we were going to try to move on. 
[00:49:30]  By the way, just so you're kind of informed, I think you know by now, Michael Vick sentenced  to 23 months in jail.  Oh, yeah.  It's a little doggy thing.  It's a little doggy fighting.  He didn't get to play this year.  He's not going to be able to play next year.  He's only going to do, what, half the sentence, probably?  Yeah, that's usually what they do.  Time off.  So he'll be back in the NFL, not next year, but the year after.  And he'll be back playing.  Yeah.  But it's pretty creepy that he's getting 23 months. 
[00:50:00]  They are dogs.  People do horrific things and don't get 23 months in jail.  Yeah.  I don't have an example right now, but I just know.  I don't either, but we know.  Just common knowledge.  We have microphones in front of us.  Yeah, we're actually...  We've all heard the stories of the people that kill, rape, pillage.  Yeah.  Is there any pillaging going on these days?  Yeah.  I never really see much pillaging.  Well, there's a lot of mayhem.  Or mayhem.  I'm sorry.  I don't see it.  There's a lot of mayhem.  I see pillaging.  You've got to look around a little bit more.  There's a lot of mayhem going on.  Is it called looting and rioting now? 
[00:50:30]  Pillaging.  Pillaging has been changed?  Yes.  Or marauding.  Marauding.  Not many marauders marauding anymore.  There's a little marauding going on out there if you look around.  It might be going on, but no one's reporting it as marauding.  I haven't seen a news person go,  a house was marauded today.  Yeah.  Or pillaged.  Yeah.  Plundered.  There's no plundering going on.  I don't know. 
[00:51:00]  If you don't use a Citibank Visa card, a lot of...  Oh, that's when they come and plunder you.  They come and plunder you.  Hey, also, stupid Jersey.  And we love Jersey.  A lot of our listeners come from Jersey, but it's stupid Jersey.  They're going to get rid of the death penalty, I guess.  But they haven't used it since the 60s, so whatever.  It doesn't matter.  Whatever.  It's like throwing that old dried-up condom out of your wallet.  Right.  Does it really make a difference?  Yeah, but they're making it a big deal today,  but they haven't even used the thing in 40-some-odd years, so whatever. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of the death penalty, but it's going away.  I guess we're turning into some kind of weird civilized society or something.  How do they kill people in Jersey?  They don't.  That's the problem.  If they were going to, how would they do it?  Well, they had a special way.  They would run your head over with a tractor trailer.  Privateering.  What?  It just doesn't go on anymore.  What the hell is privateering?  It's like what started pirating.  Well. 
[00:52:00]  That's all.  All right.  What's wrong with you?  Just the things that slip into my mind.  I've got to get them out.  I'm thinking the bit might be over, eh?  It was fun for a while, but.  The bit ain't over.  It ain't over until I say it's over.  Until I say it's over.  When you go to that, I think we might want to move on to something else.  I don't know.  Look at your prep sheet.  We've got other things to goof on.  What?  Where is it?  I haven't seen a prep sheet in years.  It was fun when we were talking about mayhem and marauding, but. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know.  You might have taken it a little too far there.  Arr, arr.  What was the other thing?  Who gives a crap about Monday Night Football?  If you had money on the game, it was the Saints over the Falcons, 34-14.  Scott Baio gets married.  Who cares?  Steve's friend and Quiet Riot singer.  Steve's friend and Quiet Riot singer.  That's top billing is Steve's friend.  Quiet Riot, the dude died, right?  Kevin DeBrow.  Yeah.  Really nice guy. 
[00:53:00]  He died of its official cocaine overdose.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  How old was he?  He could have been more than, what, 40, late 40s, maybe?  That's what I mean.  Like, no, you shouldn't be doing coke at that age.  Late 40s?  Like, the coke should be, you should realize by the time you're.  Leave the coke to the young.  By the time you're 25, you should realize you should never, ever do coke anymore.  Before that, hey, who am I to say?  Take your chances on, you know, dropping dead.  But.  25?  By 25, you should realize, okay, this stuff will kill you. 
[00:53:30]  Let me think.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Oh, yeah.  That's about right.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  That's about right.  Yeah.  Let's just put it that way.  That's about right.  52 he was.  Okay, thank you.  52.  52.  All right.  Now, finally, we go back to the Zeppelin thing.  We got actual audio of the big reunion concert.  I want to hear from Rick from Monroe.  No!  I want to hear from him before we play this.  Is this Monroe in Rochester? 
[00:54:00]  Monroe.  Rick, is this Monroe in Rochester?  This is Monroe in Louisiana.  Oh, Louisiana.  How you doing, my friend?  What's up there, Rick?  Doing fine, boys.  Hey.  Now, what's up with Robert Plant?  Leave Robert Plant around.  I mean, I love you.  Do you?  Okay, you ass.  I thought he really wanted to back him up.  Hey, Mike from Long Island makes a very good point.  Mike from Long Island, what's up?  What's up, O&A?  Hey.  Listen, Jersey stopped at the death penalty. 
[00:54:30]  They're not going to use that anymore.  Instead, they're just going to send you to Newark from now on.  I love Newark jokes because they're trying so hard to clean up Newark.  But come on.  Come on.  At the new arena.  You know, some hockey announcer.  I don't have all the details.  I forgot his name and all that because it was one of these stories I read and that was it.  I didn't have to memorize the details.  But he had to apologize to Newark.  And he had to walk around with the politicians and the local dudes. 
[00:55:00]  What did he say?  He made fun of Newark and how the devil's playing this awesome stadium, awesome arena in Newark.  Brand new, right?  Yeah.  What's it called there, E-Rock?  The Rock.  The Rock, right.  The Rock.  But he said, but it's still in Newark.  And as soon as you leave the place, it's a bit scary.  It was more of a joke than anything.  It is scary.  But then he had to go there and he had to apologize.  And they had to like, they gave him a, Barry Melrose, thank you.  They had to give him a tour of the area.  And then he had to kind of grovel and apologize for saying that. 
[00:55:30]  I'm sorry.  Look, man.  Around the Rock.  I went to an Islanders-Devils game recently.  And yes, around the Rock, it's quite enjoyable.  It's quite nice.  And there's a path from the train station right to the Rock, so there's no confusion.  It's named after Alcatraz.  I mean, you know, could you have maybe named it something else?  It's five blocks.  And there's so many cops where even if you wanted to kind of stray, you're not going to.  Because the cops are going to be like, ah! 
[00:56:00]  No, they keep being like cowboys with cattle.  They're swinging ropes.  You're just like cows getting into a train.  Smacking you.  All I'm saying is what I saw, yeah, very nice.  And the Rock, very, very nice.  But I want to go four or five blocks away from the Rock.  Going to venture a little further?  I want to see what that's all about.  Good luck to you.  Anyway.  Good luck.  Where were we?  Okay, Robert Plant and Zeppelin reunion last night.  First time in 28 years.  We finally got audio.  Finally got audio.  From the BBC. 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  And this is how it sounded last night.  This is them doing a little black song.  This is it.  This is everyone's raving about Led Zeppelin back together.  The reviews are in.  It was fantastic.  Amazing.  These people were hypnotized.  They were hypnotized.  Jimmy Page came out with his Gandalf hair and cast a spell on him because he is a wizard.  He practices, what's your dream?  Where's Jimmy?  What's your dream?  And he mesmerized the audience. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  And this is what they were actually hearing.  Look, man.  We'll take what we can.  Us Zeppelin fans, we'll take what we can.  First time in 28 years.  Personally, I would have liked it after eight years.  But what are you going to do?  Even after eight years?  I guess they had a way for Jason Bonham to grow up.  Yeah.  Robert Plant was on his love song, Little Twist.  Oh, his honey dripper face.  The honey drippers. 
[00:57:30]  What was that song he sang?  Big Log.  That one.  He did sing Big Log.  Big Log.  I had to play that when I was at CMF, the home of rock and roll.  Big Log.  If you remember when we met.  Big Log wasn't as bad as the honey drippers.  And then they did that other song where they actually sampled some Zeppelin.  And then he tried to sing along with it.  Dude.  Lighten up. 
[00:58:00]  It's called Long Cool One.  Oh, okay.  You're talking to a rock child.  Of course.  I just know, lighten up baby.  I would play that as a twofer.  A twofer.  That would be considered a twofer?  On Twofer Tuesday.  You wouldn't be able to call up and say, you guys made a mistake, you owe me $50,000?  No, because it was a Robert Plant twofer.  Oh, okay.  A thematic twofer.  We had it all figured out.  Was that that song?  It was like a rap, just really fast, high-paced song.  You'd hear like...  That was a cool plant song. 
[00:58:30]  You'd hear this sampled like, ha ha mama.  And then you'd hear, hey, hey mama.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  He sucked in that.  Find tall, cool one.  You'd hear the original sampled, hey, hey mama.  Hey, hey mama.  You're crazy.  I'm not.  I know it because I laughed at that.  I can't get there.  Yes.  He hit his life call and it made feedback on the guitar.  It's obvious you were never a Zeppelin fan.  I was. 
[00:59:00]  That's why I'm so upset by this.  Just listen to me.  I'm yelling again.  This is tall, cool one.  Yeah, but you're going to have to get to the end where the sample is.  Put on the brake and one on the gas.  Hey, Dan.  Dan.  Sorry.  I'm like a strange cat running in the heat of the night.  Studio.  Relax.  Every line is taken separately.  That song is, I got to think, when I was in Rochester, late 80s, early 90s. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  He still had his voice.  A little bit.  You can't make fun of Robert Plant from that.  Dude, get to the end of it where he's singing directly with the samples of his old studio  stuff.  All right.  We'll find it.  Hey, hey mama.  Hey, hey mama.  Well, they did a great sample at the end of that song.  Yeah.  I'm going to say one of the first samples used in another song, by the way.  Really?  I think so.  And then the rap guy.  I don't know about that.  Oh, what?  You got it?  You got it?  E-Rock. 
[01:00:00]  Let's see.  It's right near the end of the song, by the way.  Hold on.  Says it again.  It's not that bad. 
[01:00:30]  You're getting picky.  I am not.  Blows.  How much time left?  Ten seconds.  Sorry.  Lighten up.  There you go.  Getting some mileage out of your old tunes. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Here we go.  We got Zeppelin from last night doing their reunion concert.  First one in 28 years.  Give a listen.  Enjoy.  Yes, absolutely.  And here we go.  There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold. 
[01:01:30]  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  Huh.  And when she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed.  With a word, she can get what she came for.  He sounds better than I thought he would.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:02:00]  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  I can't get enough of those guys singing.  Hey, here's a guy that works in Newark.  It's Pat in New Jersey.  Pat.  Pat.  Pat.  Guys, how you doing?  You're kidding.  For the people that linger longer.  What's up there, Pat?  Linger.  How you guys doing?  You're kidding. 
[01:02:30]  I work.  Yeah, I love them.  Can we play?  I love them.  Can we go?  Can we play that going into break?  We'll bring a few more people aboard as far as the linger longerers go.  Go ahead, Pat.  All right.  You guys don't know about this, but last week, three banks were robbed right in downtown Newark.  Yeah.  There was a guy that was stabbed to death a couple weeks ago that you don't hear about.  Yeah.  And there was also at a check cashing place a guy shot in the head about a month ago.  Yeah.  You don't hear about that kind of stuff.  Right around the Prudential pumping, by the way.  Look, I know what they're doing.  They're revitalizing the city. 
[01:03:00]  They're doing well so far, but they've got a ways to go.  Oh, yeah.  So you should be able to make fun of Newark being a hellhole still.  It's a crap hole.  Give it a few more years, and then we'll be on board with you.  But it's got a ways to go here.  Yeah.  Don't start making it sound like it's a real safe city.  Paradise.  And then we go, let's go to Newark and go Christmas shopping.  And then we're horrified by what we're seeing four or five blocks away from the rock.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  It's insane.  This is Iraq in the U.S.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Take care, guys.  All right.  It's Pat.  Well, it's not Iraq in the U.S.  That's West Philly is that.  Let's go to Ray in Westchester.  Ray.  Yeah, you guys are not right.  I thought I was going to hear plant like a shadow like crap.  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  And by the way, that was the head coach of the Devils that said that.  It wasn't an announcer.  It was the head coach.  Ah.  The head coach?  Yeah.  Huh. 
[01:04:00]  That's one thing bad about hockey and the Devils.  No one really cares about the Devils.  It's the oddest thing.  We win championships and there's no big parades.  And that's why they moved the arena and everything, trying to get that team rolling.  All right.  Here's the deal.  When we get back, we really do.  At this point, our listeners don't believe us, and I understand that.  We're just idiots.  We really do.  We really do have some audio of Zeppelin from last night.  We really do.  It's about a minute.  That's all we got so far.  It's fantastic. 
[01:04:30]  What is it?  Black Dog?  We got a little taste of Black Dog.  Was that what it was?  I couldn't really tell.  And we even got the original song, So You Can Goof a Little More.  Ah.  Good.  Good.  You're not a Zeppelin.  What?  What, Tom?  We got to take a break.  No, no.  It wasn't the head coach who said it.  Oh.  I didn't think it was either.  Thank you.  Go back.  See, the listeners are silly.  Sometimes they get silly.  He was the announcer, right?  For ESPN or something?  Yeah.  Barry Melrose.  Barry Melrose.  Who's not the...  Right.  Right.  Wasn't he a former Islander coach? 
[01:05:00]  Wow.  I don't know.  Those might be the years when they changed their uniform and I wasn't paying attention.  Well, they went to the Gordons of Gloucester Fisherman.  I don't acknowledge that they weren't even a team in the NHL at that point.  But it was definitely Barry Melrose from ESPN.  Yeah.  Okay.  Very good.  Yeah.  Because this show needs to be accurate.  Yes.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  It was the head coach.  You don't want somebody saying it was the head coach.  No, you're right.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  But I would assume the head coach would say the same thing.  That's why I let that guy say what he wanted.  He ain't walking around.  Right.  I've been there. 
[01:05:30]  It's actually really nice around the area.  No, I've been there, too.  The whole area?  How far?  Is Newark advertising with the station, is that...  Where have they set up the perimeter?  Where are the claymores?  So I don't trip over them.  No, no.  What's going on...  It's a level on Call of Duty 4.  It's actually a level.  I'll tell you.  It's like Jurassic Park.  Yeah.  No, I'll tell you.  I've been to the Rock for an Islander Devils game.  The place is beautiful.  And the walk from the train station to the Rock is awesome.  That's all I know. 
[01:06:00]  They're doing the same thing they do in the Bronx.  Yeah, with Yankee Stadium.  It's like a stadium where you park your car and all of a sudden you got like a...  It's like you're in a cornfield.  They keep you on the cow path.  I mean, a corn maze.  Yeah, they keep you on the cow path so you don't...  They keep you...  And it's all fenced in.  Stray.  And there's no way of straying off track.  And you get to the stadium and you watch the Yankees.  You know what happens when a zebra gets away from the whole herd on the way to the watering  hole.  If you shined a flat like one of those flashlights, you'd see all these little eyes just blowing 
[01:06:30]  into the woods.  Through the fences, you'd just see a bunch of eyes looking back at you.  They're just hoping.  The hell is that?  They're just hoping you want to go exploring.  They got people in yellow jackets to make sure you don't stray from the path.  Yes.  They understand.  They know they got a ways to go down there.  When you walk away, they ask you where you're going.  Yeah.  Where are you going?  Do you know you're going this way towards the rock?  Right.  Okay, sorry.  Do you know where you're going?  We got people that won't let you get off the path.  That's nice.  But it's like cattle. 
[01:07:00]  You just go from the train to the...  Yeah, cattle that's going to be slaughtered.  All right, listen.  Listen.  We got some real Zeppelin when we come back.  All right.  We definitely want to hear it.  There was something else.  Oh, the bill call.  Yes.  Bill's dead.  This is a quick phone call we got back in the day when we were living and working up  there in Worcester, Massachusetts.  This lady called our radio station looking for her friend Bill.  And well, this is what happened.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi. 
[01:07:30]  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Yeah, kid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's tragic.  Who is this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  It's John. 
[01:08:00]  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did this happen?  This afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God.  Love him.  Yeah.  Big, big, big pile up. 
[01:08:30]  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I got to go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Hi.  Welcome back.  It's the Anthony show.  Glad you're joining us today.  Are you?  I am. 
[01:09:00]  Why wouldn't I be?  Bam.  Bam.  We were chatting about chatting about the Led Zeppelin reunion.  Big, big story.  Everybody's crowing about it.  Everybody's crowing about it, saying how great it was.  The reviews are very good, Anthony.  They did one show over there in jolly old England, and it got raves.  Yeah.  But everything I heard, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:09:30]  How did it sound?  That's all I care about.  How did it sound?  How did it sound?  How did it sound?  Why are you so against Led Zeppelin?  I just don't like a band that can't sound like they recorded themselves.  Why would you?  If you see Britney Spears, and she puts out her album, and you realize it's all studio 
[01:10:00]  effects, and she could never pull it off live, why would you give her any respect?  That's what she does.  That's what she does.  Well, it's like Journey.  Led Zeppelin went in the studio.  They put out albums.  The guy can't do that.  Yeah.  Like Journey, Journey, I would never want them to come back, because he could never sing.  You don't think he could?  Steve Perry?  I heard his voice.  Can't do it.  Really?  Can't do it.  Steve Perry?  Can't do it.  Really?  Can't do it.  Can't do it?  Yeah.  Steve Perry? 
[01:10:30]  Are you sure?  Can't do it?  Nope.  When did you see him?  Last Tuesday.  What did he sing for you?  He was taking an entry downtown.  We were talking.  Hey.  How are we going?  Well, Ant, so when you see Gwen Stefani, does she sound just like her record?  Yes, Gwen Stefani.  No, actually, Gwen Stefani sings down lower than her records, and they usually double her voice.  Did he really see Gwen Stefani live?  Yeah.  You did?  Yes, I did. 
[01:11:00]  I'm not even going to make an excuse.  Why are you getting mad at me?  Why are you getting mad at me?  You're the one who's sorry.  You see the look he gave you?  Like, okay, yes, I did.  Like, you've never taken a girl to a show.  Never.  Never.  Never taken a girl to a show.  Never.  Never.  Never.  Never.  Wait, you used to say you enjoyed it, though, too.  I didn't hate it.  I didn't think it was awful.  Were you dancing?  She was...  No.  No.  Come on.  You didn't move your hips a little?  No.  No.  Come on, right there.  You didn't clap your hands? 
[01:11:30]  It was kind of before this, Gwen.  Come on.  You weren't clapping?  No, I was no hollaback girl.  Did you hollaback?  No, I didn't hollaback.  Did you throw your panties on the stage?  Shut up.  Were you part of the crowd going,  ain't no hollaback girl?  No, I wasn't hollering back or nothing.  You got both your hands over your head,  moving with, like, opposite of your hips.  When your girlfriend wants to see Gwen Stefani,  wants to see No Doubt,  you go and you see No Doubt. 
[01:12:00]  Why wouldn't you?  You do go.  You do go.  Why wouldn't you?  You do go.  Yeah, you better say you do go,  you son of a bitch.  You better say that.  She would never want to go see Gwen Stefani,  and your girl would never let...  She would never go,  you have to come with me.  Dude, I went and saw Madonna with my chick.  I got to go.  What?  All right, mister.  Every concert you've been to has been manly.  There had to be one at some point.  No, I don't.  The only thing I'll do...  Christopher Cross.  The only thing I've done... 
[01:12:30]  Kind of saying Journey is a little, you know...  Yeah, yeah, Journey in itself,  but Journey, look, I like some Journey songs.  Back in the day, I think that was...  There's a lot of guys that like some Journey songs,  but I think in general they were known as a chick band.  No, they were.  Yeah, they were.  I don't think so.  A little bit.  Flying beside me here.  Oh, wow, you know the words.  Listen.  Open arms.  Yeah, it was a great song.  Yeah.  You don't... 
[01:13:00]  I would never go see Gwen Stefani.  Madonna, I could take...  She's kind of iconic.  You know what I mean?  She's pretty...  She's pretty...  Not only did I go to the Madonna show,  it wasn't that bad.  Yeah, she's pretty iconic.  Except for the 30,000 homosexuals that were at the show, huh?  Let's just put it this way.  As a party.  It was good people watching.  It was a good people watching night.  But it would be so easy to go,  yeah, I went to Madonna, I got dragged along,  and it sucked, dude.  Dude, it sucked.  It wasn't bad. 
[01:13:30]  I went to go see Jackson Brown because of a girl.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Did you punch her in the face?  Later on, I should have.  But I'm a gentleman.  I saw Wicked.  I'll go to a Broadway play.  Yeah.  I've done that.  There's your feminine side.  I've seen The Lion King.  I saw Wicked.  You saw Wicked?  Yeah.  Did you like it?  Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool.  There's a little unique back,  kind of behind-the-scenes storyline going on  from The Wizard of Oz.  No.  The Wicked Witch. 
[01:14:00]  Don't ruin it for everybody, you fruit.  Who cares?  I think Broadway was off for a while.  And I'm going to go see The Little Mermaid.  You're not.  I won't allow it.  Yes, I am.  I won't allow it.  I'm going to go see Drowsy Chaperone starring Bob Saget.  And I think the Philly crew's coming up to see Wicked,  and I think I might be dragged along to that.  Maybe not, though,  because it seems like it's going to be a chick day,  which is good.  Why the hell is 12-year-old Seth saying I suck right now?  I don't know.  Let's say hi to 12-year-old Seth.  We're all over the place. 
[01:14:30]  12-year-old Seth.  Seth?  Yeah.  Why do I suck?  What's the matter?  What did you call for?  Seth, what's up?  Nothing.  What, are you on the dope, son?  Anthony sucks.  Why does Anthony suck?  He sucks right now.  I love Anthony, but he sucks right now.  Why?  He needs to come up with an excuse.  Oh, for what?  For going to see No Doubt? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  I took my girlfriend.  She wanted to go, so I took her.  No, no, you took...  Well, you know what you should have done?  What?  You should have hired a guy and made a mold of your face.  So that guy can go instead of you.  So you can stay home.  And be a man.  Seth, you rule like Mission Impossible or something.  Seth's dad's not yelling at Seth's mom going, he's playing with dolls, Ro! 
[01:15:30]  No.  No.  Seth's a good kid.  Why aren't you in school?  Seth.  Seth, pay attention.  What do you got, that ADD or something?  What do you got?  What do they got you on?  He's listening to himself on the radio.  Seth, what are you on?  What do you mean?  Seth, why aren't you at school?  Well, because I'm driving, I'm like three or four blocks away.  You're driving?  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Who's driving, your dad or your mom?  My mom.  Oh.  When did dad leave?  All right, they're listening to himself.  Seth, we got to hang up.  You broke the rule.  As soon as you start listening to yourself, we got to move on.  Stupid little kid.  I was going to tell...  If his father left him, I was going to tell him it's his fault.  Seth, your father left you and it was your fault.  Yeah.  All right, finally.  I'm glad Seth was on my side.  You should have got a mask of your own face.  And sent someone else.  Only a 12-year-old kid could come up with that. 
[01:16:30]  I know you danced.  There's no way...  Because I know how you get.  When you get something a little drunk, a little wine in them, all of a sudden you get a little  happy, you and your girl.  He doesn't dance.  There was no dancing.  I would love to help you out, Bob.  Let me tell you where it was.  It was at Roseland.  The place was packed.  I was up on the balcony like in a VIP section.  Looking down on pretty much 11 through 16-year-old girls just dancing on the dance floor. 
[01:17:00]  Did you throw your big boy underpants down onto the stage?  That's what I did.  That's what I did.  How funny would that be just to throw your big boy underpants onto the stage?  It was a Chris Hansen special in the making.  Is what it was.  Because all the little girls wanted to dress like slutty Gwen.  And by the way...  When Stefani put it on her head through the pee hole slice.  No, you dummy.  And Robert, we can take phone calls for the next 20 minutes.  They're lit with people that have gone to kind of wimpy shows with their girl. 
[01:17:30]  And then someone's saying...  And it wasn't even that bad in the end.  So let's get into this Zeppelin thing that happened last night.  28 years.  They finally played again.  And we got some audio, Anthony.  You ready for this?  Yes, I am.  You're the one that wants to hear this.  You're a traitor.  You're a Led Zeppelin traitor.  I'm not a traitor.  I just want to hear Zeppelin like it sounded on the album.  Zeppelin was a big part of all our youth.  And you're turning your back on Zeppelin.  This concert was in England then. 
[01:18:00]  It wasn't here.  It was across the pond somewhere.  But didn't we make them famous?  They got famous here, right?  Whatever.  Well, I was just asking.  I don't know.  I was just thinking a little backstory.  I don't really know, actually.  I want to move on that quick.  Go ahead.  All right.  Push a button.  Jesus.  Here we go.  Zeppelin from last night.  Now, I've got a role.  I can't stand still.  I've got a flame in the heart.  I can't get myself.  What? 
[01:18:30]  All right.  This is Black Dog, right?  What is it?  It sounds like bluegrass music.  It's just...  He's playing the bass, like on one of those Washingtons.  Like a mouth tick.  How about we do this?  This is the original Black Dog from the album.  All right.  Good.  So, we have a little comparison here.  Go ahead there, E-Rod.  I've got a role.  Can't stand still.  Got a flame in the heart.  Can't get my fill. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  All right.  And now this is from last night.  I've got a role.  Can't stand still.  Got a flame in the heart.  Can't get my fill.  Oh, God.  All right.  Let me hear a...  All right.  Now the next part of this song.  No.  Why would you be prepared for that?  Listen to how much higher that is.  Here's the second part.  Oh, my God.  I've been shy, burning red.  Dreams of you all flew my head. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  Let that linger a minute.  All right.  That was amazing.  Yes.  This is last night.  I've been shy, burning red.  Dreams of you all flew my head.  Oh, God.  What's he doing?  It's a butchering.  If a cover band went up and did that Zeppelin song like that, they would be booed off the  state.  Boo.  Boo.  We got the next part. 
[01:20:00]  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right.  And from last night.  Oh, you cop-out. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  All right.  See, I'm done.  I'm done.  Do you rest your case?  I rest my case.  That follows me.  That part where the...  Don't.  First of all...  He sounded like Scooby-Doo.  All you got to do is...  Ah, ah, ah.  And he gives it off to the audience.  He gives it off to the audience.  Wait.  I...  And then he goes...  Scooby-Star. 
[01:21:00]  You're right, Robert.  God, I think anyone can hit that...  Not hit that note, but at least make it sound closer.  Here it is again.  Ah.  Here comes the...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[01:21:30]  Dreams of you all through my head.  It did sound like Buffalo Bill doing the song.  Would you?  Would you?  Dreams of you all through my head. 
[01:22:00]  Great big fat person.  Going back to yesterday's show, it sounds like Robert Plant is now 8 foot 2 inches tall.  He's got that giantism thing.  Yeah, giantism.  That changes voice.  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  I was in a band called Blood Zipplin.  With his giant head.  A lot of hits you may have heard.  But since then, I've been...  My pituitary gland kind of went crazy, and I'm now 9 foot 2 and have this voice. 
[01:22:30]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Hey, baby.  Whoa, baby.  Pretty baby.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm now 8 foot 2.  Singing for lunch.  Ah, well...  Hey, speaking of Gwen Stefani, you know, going back to that, Ant,  we do have another Grammy moment, a special Opie and Anthony Grammy moment. 
[01:23:00]  Love him.  Grammy's going to be happening soon.  The nominations were announced a couple days ago, right?  Mm-hmm.  And this is what we're doing with the announcement.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Best pop collaboration with vocals.  The Sweet Escape, Gwen Stefani and Acon.  If I could escape and recreate a place I love in the world,  and I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together, 
[01:23:30]  tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?  If I could be sweet, I know I've been a real bad girl.  I didn't mean for you to get hurt forever.  We can make it better.  Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?  The Sweet Escape.  Woo-hoo-hoo!  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  The Grammy Awards, February 10th at 8 p.m. on CBS.  All right, we've got to get rid of the last part of that.  It sounds like it's a commercial, man.  It is.  But it's a bit.  They're trying to sneak a commercial in there.  We are trying to sneak a commercial in there.  It's our bit.  It's our bit!  It's our bit!  All right.  I think I might have lost the Zeppelin argument.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, let's go to JR in Philly.  I proved it.  JR, what's up, buddy? 
[01:24:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Love you.  Love the show.  I am.  I wanted to do a rock stream, and also wanted to thank you guys.  When you guys had Carlin on last month, I went out and got more of his stuff.  He came through Philly.  Yeah.  He was an animal.  He killed.  And luckily, it was an early show, so we could get out of the city before all the balloons  come out.  Linger longer!  Jesus.  So, anyway, let me give you my rock stream.  I'm in first.  I'm about to leave.  Okay.  Ready?  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Hang on.  Oh!  Wow!  Nice transition.  Very nice.  Hey, Ope.  Yeah?  Since you work with Anthony, who's so Mr. Divorce, what made you decide to get married?  Because we're different people.  Because he's not marrying my ex. 
[01:25:30]  Jesus.  Yeah, exactly.  I figured I'd give it a shot.  Why not?  Unbelievable.  I found someone that I'm very happy with.  So, why not?  Right, Bob Kelly's married?  That's right.  You're above you.  At least, I'm in my pay scale.  You're not, but...  You're in pay scale.  You're really out of your own tax bracket on that one.  I'm not talking about money, right?  Are you basically saying I'm the short end of the stick?  Oh, my God.  Woozy, doozy.  Are you basically saying that if people were playing short end of the stick, I would lose?  Well, what are you going to do, dudes? 
[01:26:00]  I mean, yeah.  It should be noted that Robert Kelly's in love with my fiancÃ©e.  Yeah, your fiancÃ©e's a hottie.  You're in love with her, though.  When you go to the beach with her and she's in a bikini, do you take your shirt off, too?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why do you think I work out six, seven days a week?  No, that's why I'm glad.  I'm trying to keep up.  My chick's hot.  Or at least be in the same game.  My chick's hot, but she's not like that, where I'd have to do sit-ups.  Jesus.  That's a backhanded insult to your wife. 
[01:26:30]  You kind of marry what you are.  You meet what you are in life.  And Opie decided to break that rule and use his fame and his money.  Was it your personality?  Yes.  Really?  You just met at a mall?  She had no idea who she was?  Actually, she did not know who I was.  Oh, are you out of your mind?  I swear to God.  She didn't know who you were.  How'd you meet?  That's what Yoko said, too, about John Lennon.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Some chick from Philly didn't know who you were.  How'd you meet?  At an O&A gig.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  Exactly.  She was there picking up her brother.  She was picking up her brother?  Who was a fan of the show?  Really?  She swears.  I believe her.  And then she saw you from a distance and was like, wow.  You ever meet that guy?  Yeah.  I actually turned around thinking she was looking at somebody else.  That old gag.  But I really, really did.  And there was no one behind me.  I'm like, you gotta be effing kidding me.  And then you walked up to her?  Like two hours later.  Really? 
[01:27:30]  It took me two hours.  And then what'd you say?  Hey.  You said, hey?  I said, hey.  Hey?  And what'd she say?  Hey.  Yeah.  Do you have a towel?  Well, good luck with that, though.  I mean, for me, I get to, you know, I get to be me.  You have to.  I'm me?  Well, you have to keep it together, dude.  You better keep it together.  You know, there are times I'm at the gym and I don't feel like really putting in the effort.  And then I do think about it a little bit. 
[01:28:00]  And I pump out a few extra.  So you look over and she's actually talking to some young guy.  He's 21 with just shredded.  All right.  A towel.  You need a towel?  Oh, yeah.  That'd be great.  Thank you.  Who are you here with?  Oh, that's my fiancee over on the treadmill on stage two.  Yeah.  It's called walk running.  Oh, Jesus.  It's low impact on the knees.  He's got a heart monitor wrapped around his chest.  I don't do low impact.  He's got a neon little iPod. 
[01:28:30]  Are you crazy?  Wow.  You want me to pump out 50 right now and show you low impact?  Yes.  50 pushups?  Yes.  I did it on the street in front of a Marine who challenged me.  Really?  A Marine.  Go to YouTube if you don't believe me.  I'm not humoring you today.  No.  You know what, dude?  I believe.  There was a Marine that came up to us.  He was jogging when we were doing the walk over and he was being tough guy.  I go, all right.  I'll do some pushups with you.  Then again, he was like a retired Marine and he was about 50 something. 
[01:29:00]  I'm saying it was an Army guy, not a Marine.  Oh, Army.  Okay.  He had a WW2 hat on.  Veterans of Foreign War.  It's a little VFW hat.  And I pushed out 50 in front of him.  That's good.  50's good.  50's real.  Say, there he is.  Army guy right there.  50's good.  But let me tell you something.  Your fiance's 150 pushups.  Bob could, first of all, Bob can do 80 pushups.  Who, me? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  On Call of Duty.  Your character.  Not your general.  I forgot.  Not in real life.  Maybe one.  And if you talk out of line again, I'll maybe have you do 80 in front of me.  So keep it together.  We forgot.  You're a superstar on line.  That's right.  Great.  I'm a superstar in real life.  What color is your girl's eyes?  Blue.  Baby blues.  Jesus.  Will you stop with my chick?  I mean, her eyes are almost magical.  Yeah, but when Robert Kelly sees my girl, he actually leaves the room. 
[01:30:00]  He says he can't be in the same room with her.  Yeah.  You're weird.  No, that's not weird.  That's just I'm a good friend.  I'm a real good friend.  We got to take a break.  Jim Norton's here.  Is he?  Yes, he just flew in from L.A.  And we made him wait like a guest before he can come in.  I didn't make him wait.  I just got a note that says Jim is here.  Okay.  Is he in the green room?  He's probably in the green room.  Get Jim what he needs and we'll bring him in if we got time.  So Chubby, move over to this mic.  Oh! 
[01:30:30]  That had to hurt.  He's not moving.  He's not acknowledging that you call him Chubby.  Look at E-Rock instantly got up out of reflex to move.  Going after my girl like that.  It was a compliment.  It's been nothing but nice to you.  What bad?  I said nothing bad about her.  She's gorgeous.  We were this close to starting to hang out.  Her eyes are greener than bluer?  She's gorgeous.  What?  Her eyes are greener than bluer too.  That's my point.  And this is Captain Sensitive over here.  Her eyes aren't green or blue.  They're this mix of magic. 
[01:31:00]  This mix of magic.  That's why I can't look at her in the eyes because they're almost liquid.  They're moving as you look.  They're changing.  They're shape-shifting.  She's an alien?  Is that what you're saying?  Let me tell you something.  I would never, ever, ever in my life say anything bad about your fiancee.  I think she's beautiful and I love her to death.  I'm actually saying good luck to you keeping up with somebody that good.  You're right.  I get to be chunky.  If I was at Lindsay, I'd have to keep my stuff together. 
[01:31:30]  But I don't want to be chunky.  All right.  Good for you.  I'm doing this for myself first, working out and taking care of myself.  Really?  Oh, wow.  Now we got to fight.  Anyone that knows me knows this is me.  Okay.  All right.  I agree.  I've never stopped working out.  Even through my...  Fight Bobby, you're going to get your ass kicked.  Even through my...  Online.  Yeah, I know.  I was an athlete my whole life.  Even through my drug days, I was still working out.  Finding time for the gym and stuff.  Yeah.  This is me. 
[01:32:00]  I just got to step in.  Oh, my God.  What the eff...  Because I am also included in this.  What happened right before we got fired at N.E.W.?  Have you seen those pictures?  We're messes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We're miserable.  The both of us are messes.  Right before we got fired, we were going through hell and back back in the day.  And yeah, that was probably where I looked my worst.  And certainly...  Yeah.  Certainly Anthony.  All bloated. 
[01:32:30]  I did see pictures of Anthony back then.  It's like...  Just big, fat.  Anthony was probably, what, 40 pounds heavier?  40.  More?  Yeah.  Wow.  Anthony did it.  Because Anthony's a small guy to begin with.  Yeah.  Now, we both were kind of a mess.  Just a little guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you look good now.  Thank God for your...  Go after yourself.  You do.  You look good.  Go after yourself.  Don't be so sensitive, redhead.  Go play Call of Duty 4.  Norton's back from L.A.  We don't need you anymore.  Oh! 
[01:33:00]  He really...  No, but he really does.  No, he really does.  That's how Opie rolls.  That's right, I roll.  Baby, shut your face.  You shut up.  Shut up and bring Norton in.  You shut up.  You little baby.  Can't even give you a comment.  You get all messed up.  I'm a sergeant online.  Who gives a crap?  General.  You're a private at the home.  Let's go to your gay concerts with your chick and shut your face.  It was one.  It was Madonna.  Oh, well, I'm yelling that.  Gee, pretty much top of the pyramid of gay concerts there.  And I do live in a nice place, and I already realize it's her place, really. 
[01:33:30]  So, here you go.  This is yours.  I actually...  I yelled at my girl.  I was like, look, I'll hang something on...  That's my wall, too.  I want to hang an Aussie poster.  I'll hang an Aussie poster.  And then I was like, is that okay?  Dude.  Doesn't go with the tapestry.  You know what's going on in my place?  I went the designer route, and I'm very happy,  because I don't know crap.  Right.  Right?  But he's making me throw all my stuff away.  I'm like, I don't want to hang my... 
[01:34:00]  I want to hang my path picture up in this room.  Bye-bye.  He's like, well, maybe in the third guest room that no one's going to see or use.  I'm like, no, I want it in my master bedroom.  Tacky.  Doesn't go with the colors.  I want it up on the wall.  All my stuff is in storage.  All my frame little things.  Never to come out.  It's in storage.  Now I have, like, lips.  I bought myself, back in the day, a nice leather-like chair from Pottery Barn.  Gone.  He doesn't like the color of that. 
[01:34:30]  I'm like, I...  So now he's redoing the color there, so it fits in the apartment.  I'm like, but I like it how it is!  I'm losing...  Ooh.  Is that you?  Wow.  Is that Anthony?  No.  Wow.  Wow, that's how it looks to have hair.  You look like you solved mysteries.  Wow, that's some long hair I got going.  Wow.  Pop that up on onaradio.com today.  Went through quite a few phases.  Whoa.  There's Anthony.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:35:00]  Wow.  Oh, me.  Oh, Christ.  That's Andrew WK, right?  God, how old are these pictures?  Yeah, where did he go?  That's what I was getting at.  Ah, we got to take a break.  I'm like this.  All right.  We'll continue?  Yes.  After these messages.  Are we good?  We're good, baby.  You sure?  Yeah, we're good.  Of course.  I love you, Hope.  Why are you laughing?  I'm not.  I'm smiling.  Why are you smiling?  Because I love you.  Yeah?  Yeah, and Lindsay.  Lindsay and my girl will get along. 
[01:35:30]  I know.  But I don't know if we can do that.  Why don't you two hug it out?  Come on.  Hug it out.  Don't talk it a lot.  Can I go to your girl for a massage?  Yeah.  She doesn't do massage, but if you want to get freaky like that, sure.  Yeah.  I thought she did massages.  No.  She does facials and vacuchies.  You can do that, but Bob Kelly may come to you someday and ask you for a favor.  Oh, come on.  Can I get my...  You know, I have that.  Can she, uh...  What, wax your...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give you a nice... 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  If you went to...  You'd allow that?  What, her to do your thing?  Yeah.  Your bush fat?  I don't have...  What?  That's what they call it.  No, they call it on you.  Guys in shape don't have bush fat.  That's why they call it bush fat.  It doesn't matter how skinny you get.  You can lose all the weight.  Africans, starving Africans have that inch of bush fat.  Go in the bathroom.  I'll show you I don't have any.  Ugh.  Together?  The last thing I want to do is see red pubes. 
[01:36:30]  Red pubes make me puke.  I don't know why.  You see the little veins connecting them.  All right.  Let's get out of this break.  All right.  Let's go.  We're trying to.  It's a little late.  It's a little late.  Uh, O.P. and Anthony.  All is right with the world.  Jim Norton in studio.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Just flew in from L.A.  I guess your arms are very tired.  Waka waka.  When I walked in, the chair actually had flooded. 
[01:37:00]  And Robert Kelly had to run outside to have a smoke.  Is he coming back?  RobertKellyLive.com.  He knows I love him.  Who couldn't?  Well.  Okay.  Probably a few people.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  Having a good one so far.  Kenny singing Red Zeppelin really made me laugh.  You like that?  Yeah.  Is it worth another play?  I just blew what it was. 
[01:37:30]  That's all right.  It completely caught me off guard.  We like catching people off guard.  They thought they were hearing Zeppelin from last night.  And, uh, no.  They got to hear Kenny at first.  Here it is.  Just in case you missed it from earlier.  There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold. 
[01:38:00]  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  And when she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed.  With a word, she can get what she came for.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  What a fool.  He really is.  Robert Kelly's back in studio.  How was your, uh...  There he is.  How was your smoke?  It was good.  It's just a long way down.  Oh, yeah, well...  It's a long way down to get a butt.  Why are you breathing heavy?  It's an elevator.  It's an elevator to the street.  Yeah, it's an elevator.  Why are you breathing heavy from an elevator? 
[01:39:00]  I do jumping jacks in the elevator.  You're breathing like you took the stairs.  Yeah, well, I did.  I took two down.  Guess how many stairs, how many flights of stairs I've taken in the last six days?  The week's not even over yet.  How many?  112.  Keep it up.  112 stories.  You better keep it up.  I'm trying to get Jimmy into this.  What, taking the stairs?  I live very, uh...  I live up high, and I stop the elevator before my floor.  I do some stairs.  I would, too, if I had her.  Will you stop?  What?  You're obsessed with my chick. 
[01:39:30]  You're married.  I'm just saying.  You better keep her away from...  You're obsessed.  I'd build a bubble if I lived with her.  I wouldn't let her out of it.  Like John Travolta.  You have built a bubble under your shirt.  Yeah, what...  Who's living is not there?  Whose girlfriend is not there?  John Travolta.  Right.  I don't like how you took my thing and actually reversed it on me.  That's right.  I had to.  That's right, we did.  General.  Biodome stomach.  Hey, Steve Sounds.  We got a whole bunch of new ones, Jimmy. 
[01:40:00]  You didn't even hear the good one from yesterday.  That's so good.  Obviously, I know we set it up every time, but unfortunately there aren't people that linger  longer with this show.  We're trying to get them to linger longer.  But Steve, he makes weird sounds when he's ready to produce something for the show.  That's a new one, by the way.  What?  These get progressively worse. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  I know.  And then you got this one.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, it's like nails on a chalkboard to me.  I lift my shoulders up.  That last one is really bothering me.  I can't describe how awful that is.  Oh, I didn't realize.  How great would a shovel look hitting his face as soon as he finished that?  I love the garlic butter saw. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, the garlic butter saw.  So people are taking the Steve sounds.  Steve, you're a big star.  You know that, right?  No, I'm not.  Yeah, you are.  No, I'm not.  Yes.  Yeah, you are.  I'm a big star.  You're a big star.  Loaded and gassy.  You beat me to it.  I'm on my way to the microphone trying to think of how horrible I could make that sound,  but you really know.  Shut up.  So Austin sent this one in, and then we go to the Drew Boogie one, and then we go to the  new ones for the people that do linger longer. 
[01:41:30]  This is the world we live in.  And these are the hands we give up.  You then, let's start trying to make it a place worth living in.  So there's where we start today.  Although we should do Immigrant Song in honor of Zeppelin doing their reunion.  Sure.  Let me do this one before we get Drew Boogie's masterpiece on again. 
[01:42:00]  This was, oh, Than and Danny.  That's right.  Our own Than and Danny came up with this one, using the Steve sounds.  That's the beauty of the bit, by the way.  It's very short and quick to the point.  All right. 
[01:42:30]  And then Drew Boogie sent his in yesterday.  This is truly a masterpiece.  Listen to this.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Oh, oh, oh. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, I didn't realize, oh. 
[01:43:30]  That's fantastic.  I found my new ringtone.  That's a good one.  Danny will be hooking me up at the other joint in about an hour.  When that kicks into that Munsters theme.  That's great.  I need that as my ringtone.  Okay, so now we are up to date.  We got brand new ones to check out.  We haven't heard these yet.  We got John in Maine came up with this one.  Using the Steve sound. 
[01:44:00]  It's our Rage Music.  Rage Machine doing Street Fighting, man.  Does he do it all day, though?  I'll figure that one out. 
[01:44:30]  Then we got this one from Hirsch in New Jersey.  Metallica.  Metallica.  We'll be right back. 
[01:45:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:45:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:46:00]  This is Tom in Philly, I believe.  Let's listen to this.  It takes me away to that special place, and if I care to the world, I'd probably break down and cry. 
[01:46:30]  Here comes the...  I didn't realize!  Oh, that's a good one. 
[01:47:00]  You know it's coming.  I don't know, man.  It fits so well.  Yeah.  And finally, the last one for today, it's Chris D. here in New York City.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[01:47:30]  People love in the Metallica one, by the way.  We should end it with that one.  I don't know.  I like the Guns N' Roses one better than the Metallica.  Really?  Yeah, that hit me.  Let me hear that again.  Only because I saw it.  As soon as I heard the opening note, I knew it was coming.  I couldn't wait.  It takes me away to that special place, and if I stare too long, I'd probably break down 
[01:48:00]  and cry.  I didn't realize!  It's short and awful. 
[01:48:30]  We really thought this bit was done two weeks ago, but...  Oh, that stuff is brilliant.  I think it's still game on.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We got lots we could go to after the break.  We could talk about the Subway Strippers.  That was a pretty cool story.  Yeah.  Another home invasion.  Oh, right there on Long Island.  We got a...  They called it a rash of home invasions.  A rash.  A rash.  Yes.  It means a lot.  All right, we'll get into that next.  Also, a woman tries to sneak into Disney World with a gun, a knife, and scissors. 
[01:49:00]  She's a dope.  She's a dumb old broad.  We got Jesus in a chest X-ray.  All on the way.  Right.  There's another thing.  Oh, the Wii is being used for physical therapy.  Jesus in a chest X-ray.  Why would you...  Yeah.  I hope he's shaped like a tumor.  It's the Lord.  Is he eating me?  I'm inside out.  And we also have sex myths from the Today Show that we haven't done yet.  So we got some choices after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:49:30]  Jim Norton.  And RobertKelleyLive.com.  Opie and Anthony with ya.  On this two for Tuesday.  Twice the laughs.  Already are.  Got a full house.  We got Jim Norton.  We got Bob Kelly.  And we got brand new production that just came in.  Hot.  And this is?  Hot off the presses. 
[01:50:00]  I don't know what it is.  We started listening to it.  I don't know what it is.  We'll find out together, I guess.  You want to listen to this?  Yeah, why not?  All right.  Steve just handed this in.  Ooh.  Ooh.  The Cultural Committee of Bratislava present latest government-approved compilation of super-sexy sounds of modern music,  presenting American superstar Club Saw the Canny, singing the fabulous music like Human League. 
[01:50:30]  Don't you want me, baby?  Don't you want me?  Oh.  Don't let genocide make you unhappy.  We're all dancing stage with men without hats.  We can dance if we want to.  You can leave your friends behind.  Because if your friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, well, they're no friends of mine.  We are all selling our sisters to wealthy Americans and turning Japanese.  Turning Japanese.  I think I'm turning Japanese.  I really think so. 
[01:51:00]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Hold now, extra bonus disc from American superstar Roland.  She drives me crazy like no one else.  She drives me crazy and I can't help myself.  Roland sings fabulous songs like Talking Heads and She Is. 
[01:51:30]  And we run so far away from the Serbians like the flock of seagulls.  And I run, I run so far away.  I just run, I run both night and day.  I couldn't get away?  It's super-sexy sounds from America now in Bratislava.  Call 888-888-888-888-888. 
[01:52:00]  Why is Steve ripping off Borat?  Yeah, but what was with the Borat thing?  I liked this when it was called Borat.  I don't get why you did the Borat thing.  Why are you ripping off Borat?  Doing one of those, maybe an old K-Tel kind of commercial or, you know, super sounds of the 70s type commercial.  But you did the Borat.  Well, at least the first syllable.  That's how we usually go with these things is the, you know, the old K-Tel type version. 
[01:52:30]  But we wanted to go, like, something else.  We wanted to fight.  We wanted to go as if, like, these two were, like, icons.  These guys were cultural icons in some part of the world.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Retooling.  Retooling.  No, it was good.  Too much tool was in there.  You.  No, it was good.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, so what do you guys want to do?  You want to do the Jesus in the chest x-ray or the girls stripteasing on the subway? 
[01:53:00]  Actually, this is pretty funny.  They're playing the video right there.  They are?  Yeah.  The stripping girls on the subway.  This was a dare, I guess, right?  It's some website.  Some website dared.  It's on both news channels right now.  That's the news.  Fox 5 and Channel 11 here in New York both have the same story.  All right.  So we should play the audio here.  It was some kind of dare.  That's all we know so far.  And some of the subway riders are a bit outraged. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's outrageous.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's the story.  The subway is not the appropriate place for that.  There's clubs for that.  What do you think about girls stripping on the subway?  Well, this is for transportation.  It's okay.  Not for some lewd show.  It's okay for a guy to smell like crap and playing on a bucket.  But, you know, if we get a hot chick, it's terrible for some reason.  Now everyone's outraged.  You know, you make a good point.  Well, you know, what if you got your kids on the train?  You don't want them seeing that. 
[01:54:00]  I think they're kind of cute.  Kind of cute indeed.  Back to you in the studio.  They got to finish up with somebody that agrees with it.  They can show them on the A train doing that at like 3 in the morning.  Like 150th Street.  You'll get a different type of video out of that one.  Of course you will.  Slap happy.  You'll get a little of that mayhem.  Yes, mayhem.  And marauding.  Marauding.  Pillaging.  Pillage.  And what was the other one? 
[01:54:30]  Privateering.  Privateering.  Yes.  I heard you guys talk about that on the way in.  Rape and pillage.  I swear to God, I said that one time and my friend's like, who is that?  He wasn't kidding.  He thought the guy's name was Ray Pinpillage.  Ray Pinpillage.  That's a funny name.  Call a bar with that one.  Is Rape and pillage there?  Rape and pillage?  Hold on.  Rape and pillage?  No, he's not here.  Can we do a little red today?  Red.  There's too many curses on the red stuff. 
[01:55:00]  Why, I'll cut Z's in your cheeks, you yellow bastard.  Why don't you have a little moxie and come down here?  Moxie.  Love that old bastard.  Two bar, right?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Stripping on the subway.  It was a subway strip show.  Strap hangers will probably never forget.  The pole dancing, acrobatics, even a lap dance.  Looking at riders' faces, you can tell plenty of them got their $2.  You know what I was thinking when I saw this story, by the way? 
[01:55:30]  I'm like, why didn't we think of this?  It's one of those things someone else does.  If you're going to do that, say, why didn't we think of the airplane?  But this is an obvious one.  Until plenty of them got their $2 worth.  What would you have done if you would have been on that train car?  It depends if it was with my girlfriend or not.  The show was part of a dare.  Marissa Loop, Laura Lee Anderson, and Jessica Wu submitted to darejunkies.com, winning the $10,000 prize. 
[01:56:00]  Then the video hit YouTube and now has become all the rage online.  All the rage.  All the rage online.  Mm.  Good for them.  Pole dancers stir up a bit more for Chris Vornos.  They can do whatever they want, but try not to offend people.  Steve?  Because many people might be offended.  Steve.  With their daughter.  That's Steve's bitch.  Steve's bitch.  Hey, Steve.  That guy's ripping off.  You ripping off Boras.  They can do whatever they want. 
[01:56:30]  Come on.  What do you talk about?  What a country.  What a country.  Are they going to get Yakov Smirnoff next?  Oh, here's the music.  What do you think of this, sir?  Uh-huh.  Hmm?  Where is he?  But try not to offend people, because many people might be offended.  They'd be with their daughters, with their wives, with their mothers or grandmothers.  And it's not the proper thing.  And he's not the only one fuming.  An MTA spokesman telling the news at 10. 
[01:57:00]  Well, that was far from fuming.  He wasn't.  That wasn't fuming in the least.  That was the beginning of a boil, when you see maybe one or two bubbles.  It wasn't even that.  He said, yeah, no problem.  Just don't offend, you know.  It was a bit of a simmer.  You can't even put the paschetti in yet.  Fuming?  Not even close, Bob.  You're right.  When you're fuming, you could tell.  It's like, wow, that guy is fuming.  Yeah.  He wasn't fuming.  He was just winning the name the most female relatives in a row contest.  Oh, my. 
[01:57:30]  We get it.  It could be mother or grandmother or just an aunt or cousin by marriage.  There we go.  Oh, yeah.  We did do this bit.  Chester's liver is lingering, longering.  Or linger longer.  He said, we did this with the voyeur bus.  You're right.  Hey, they're ripping us off.  Hoo-hoo.  You should have a guy do it.  One of the ONA fans strip off the subway.  Hey, let's go back to the audio.  And this is all the proper thing.  And he's not the only one fuming.  An MTA spokesman telling the news at 10 that pole dancing on city subways violates the rules. 
[01:58:00]  Violates the rules.  What?  You know what that is?  They call the MTA.  Like, what do you think of this?  Oh, it violates the rules.  It's a real final rule.  Final rule that this violates.  Violates the rules.  Of what?  Trying to stir up a little outrage.  The news is amazing.  They're just trying to get everybody outraged.  Who cares?  They're trying to get us fuming.  I'm not, though. 
[01:58:30]  No.  No one cared.  I don't even think they got completely naked.  It was like they were in bathing suits.  Yeah.  Gives a crap.  I mean, on a given day, you could watch a homeless guy take a crap on a corner.  Yeah.  That's kind of offensive.  As people are waiting to cross the street, so what's the deal with this?  And that'll be fuming, too.  Believe me.  Past a few.  And steaming.  And steaming.  Boy, that's really steamed.  All right.  We're going to attempt to do all the stuff we teased for once.  Wow.  Now we got the woman in Disney sneaking in with weapons. 
[01:59:00]  This dumb old broad.  She's from, like, Pennsylvania.  What was she thinking?  She gets down there.  I guess they drove.  I hope they drove.  Right.  I hate to think she's able to get from Pennsylvania somewhere to Orlando with a gun on a plane,  but it was in her bag.  And she tried to get into the Magic Kingdom.  And that crack security down there at Disney nailed her.  Well, Pistol Pack and Granny heads to the happiest place on Earth.  A pistol.  Pistol Pack and Granny. 
[01:59:30]  La, la, la.  A pistol Pack and Granny tops your news this hour.  Really the happiest place on Earth?  Yes, it is the happiest place on Earth.  Well, she pulled it because it was closed.  And then it's like, well, the park is closed.  The Moose out front should have told you.  Wally world.  Orange whip.  God, I love that seat.  Sorry.  He comes just walking out like that.  He's just an awful.  Moose out front should have told you.  I'm telling.  When he's on the roller coaster, I'm telling.  This is a big thing. 
[02:00:00]  Who's going to tell?  He's got a gun.  Oh, my God.  He was just so uncomfortable in his own skin.  That's what I loved about John Candy.  You could just tell he was uncomfortable with himself.  They're trying to arrest the Blues Brothers.  Orange whip.  Orange whip.  Yep, yep.  Three orange whips.  Yeah.  Sarah, we're in a truck.  Funny Batman.  Planes, trains, and automobiles, though.  It doesn't get much better than that as far as John Candy films go.  So, all right, here we go. 
[02:00:30]  Back to the, what is this?  Oh, yeah, the pistol-packing granny.  Well, a pistol-packing granny heads to the happiest place on Earth and gets busted.  63-year-old Mary Ann Richardson was arrested after trying to take a loaded handgun into Walt Disney World.  The Pennsylvania woman was going into Magic Kingdom with her daughter and three grandchildren.  That's when security screeners found a .32-caliber handgun, a knife, and a pair of scissors at the bottom of her bag.  Now, Richardson says she simply forgot the weapon was in there.  So, you think, all right, gun, knife. 
[02:01:00]  What are you going to do with the scissors?  Nah.  What, you're not allowed to have scissors in the Magic Kingdom?  Yeah, they just name things.  And a nail file.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Doesn't really matter.  Once you get past the gun, everything else pretty much drops off pretty drastically after that.  She also had a PBA card.  A pack of gum.  You're kidding me.  Loose shade.  A compact with some eye makeup.  Wow, she could do some damage.  A gun and a piece of Friedan.  She had an open B.O. 
[02:01:30]  That thing, if she put down the bag a certain way, it's a loaded gun, you know?  Well, I don't know if it was cocked or not, but I mean, that's pretty dangerous.  That's the type of person that should not have a firearm.  Oh.  An old bitty like that.  She's 63.  Yeah, she's got no clue.  I saw her in the news.  63 is not that old.  She's old 63.  She's old 63? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  All right.  She's a dopey old bitty.  There are 63-year-olds that are very young.  Well, Ric Flair was wrestling last night, and he's got to be what?  How old is Ric Flair?  He was doing his woo!  He probably knows down to the minute.  He was part of that 15th anniversary of Raw last night.  For the woo.  And by the way, maybe we could get the audio.  Did Sam cut the audio of Vince McMahon in the beginning?  I'm convinced.  I was watching.  I took a peek last night because we're friends with the WWE, and Vince did his thing at the 
[02:02:30]  beginning of the 15th anniversary of Raw last night.  Yeah.  I think Vince McMahon listens to this show because now he's doing...  Vince is doing your version...  Of Angry Vince.  Of Angry Vince.  That's great.  You know how you're completely like...  What?  Vince requested copies.  Uh-oh.  No, I'm telling you.  It's changed, and I think he listens to this show.  You know when you really get... 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  He did that last time.  That's what he does.  That.  Right there.  That.  Really?  He over-exaggerated that last time.  Oh, that's funny.  I think Vince is listening to this show.  I love Angry Vince.  And adjusting his whole persona because it sounded more like you than Vince last night.  Can we get that real fast before we get out of here?  Keep looking.  All right.  It's right at the beginning if we take that dumb thing.  Okay.  The Wii is being used for physical therapy.  Nintendo's Wii isn't just popular with gamers. 
[02:03:30]  Some physical therapists are incorporating it into their rehabilitation programs.  Therapists at Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus are using the video games  to help patients recovering from strokes, spinal cord, or traumatic brain injuries.  They say the system can help improve patients' balance, coordination, endurance, and strength.  What kind of fun game is the stroke one?  This is don't dribble your milk.  He has to drool on the X-key. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, God.  What the hell?  If you lift yourself onto the higher toilet seat, you're an extra man.  Hemorrhoids.  He uses his cheek.  Oh, Jesus.  Donkey burden.  Donkey burden.  Oh, Stan's got the Wii. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, Stan loves it.  That's great.  Gaming system.  You know it's going to be fun when it's also used as medical equipment for stroke victims.  That's wonderful.  Yuck.  You know it's going to be a fun game.  Hey, you may mock, but the Wii console is the top toy.  Yeah, because they're buying it for not just people playing games on it.  They're buying it for little kids buy it and stroke victims.  Apparently, you have to get it.  So what's the ultimate goal? 
[02:05:00]  You get to the finish line and you get to countdown New Year's Rockin' Eve?  See, yes.  Yes, I've got to go backwards a little bit.  Flounder in Jersey.  Flounder.  I'm not the only one.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Last night, watching Raw, when Vince McMahon over-exaggerated it, all I could do was think  Anthony doing Vince.  It was not Vince doing Vince.  No, I'm telling you.  I've got to hear that now.  This was a little weird last night.  Did you hear it?  Yeah.  It was without a doubt. 
[02:05:30]  I screamed it at the TV that it was Anthony, not Vince.  Yeah, we're trying to rush it onto the show before we get out of here.  Oh, that's great.  I've got to hear that.  Have a good one, man.  Thank you.  I wish I remembered that earlier because it was so obvious, Anthony, that he was doing  your version of himself.  It was really bizarre.  Oh, cool.  This is a little leftover stuff.  The Jesus in the chest x-ray.  Now I've heard it all.  We've seen Jesus in what?  Cinnamon buns.  Piece of toast.  Piece of toast.  Grilled cheese, I believe, was one.  I saw him.  In window panes, if you're from the Boston area. 
[02:06:00]  Stomach hurt a little last night.  So he appeared before I got rid of him.  What?  You were puking last night?  No, no, no.  I was talking about the normal, you know.  Okay.  Maybe I was.  Oh, oh, oh.  I didn't want to say it.  I want to keep it a little vague.  I lost you, but now I'm with you.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  A little streak on the side of the bowl.  Yeah.  Do you hate that one?  It's like, ah, I got to get in there with the brush. 
[02:06:30]  It's almost like it was yelling, help me, help me, and trying to close it.  It would be almost like if you left and came back and it was halfway out of the bowl.  It was like a prison break.  Well, if we're going to talk about this.  Oh, no.  This is a good one.  I crossed the line yesterday, man, with my chick and my beautiful girl.  Oh, no.  You had one of those bad milestones.  And I realized afterwards, but none of you guys were around, and someone needed, I needed  documentation.  Don't tell me. 
[02:07:00]  Let's just put it this way.  On Saturday, before I went to my sister's lovely holiday party, I had some of that spicy  spaghetti.  What is it called?  Arbriata?  What is the sauce called?  Arbriata?  It has one of those names.  I don't know.  And my stomach was awful, so I just chugged Pepto way more than you should.  And that does things to me.  Let's just put it that way.  And finally, yesterday was the release. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, no.  Something.  Wow.  Something.  The word I want to use is way funnier, but I think it messes up everything.  Something kind of, let's just say your kid is at the playground, and he wants to go on  the slide, and he...  And he slides down the slide.  All right.  So just picture that.  Something.  Okay.  It can only be described as sliding.  Right.  Was he sliding it like on a peanut butter jelly sandwich down the slide? 
[02:08:00]  And I did an impromptu measurement with using my hands and stuff, not touching anything.  And it was close to two feet, one piece.  Are you sure a black mamba didn't come up through the toilet?  A black mamba.  That's what it looked like.  Bites you in the face.  That's what it looked like.  A neighbor's pet.  What's the milestone, though?  Well, I didn't have any guys around, so I...  Oh, no. 
[02:08:30]  You did not.  I didn't tell...  You didn't.  I didn't tell her to look, but I said, you're not going to believe what just happened in  there.  But you left it in there.  No.  But I had to kind of describe it.  But you wanted to...  I needed documentation.  And then...  You're so close to showing her, then.  Let me explain something to you.  My God.  You're dating a 10.  Yes.  You don't say, you got to see this dude.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Yeah, you don't do that, Al.  Do you understand what childhood stuff that is?  I had no choice.  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:00]  You can't do this.  What was her reaction?  She was not happy.  Yeah, I didn't figure.  Oh, no.  I don't want to hear this.  Oh, my goodness.  Norton did one in my room when we did one of those virus gigs with his girl.  Him and his girl were in my room.  I was in the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy laughing.  Jimmy's enjoying this.  All I heard was giggling.  I was in there doing what I have to do.  And I just heard them giggling.  And I'm like, what could they possibly do?  I thought they were stealing my stuff.  You know, doing something dumb in the room.  I come out. 
[02:09:30]  Nothing.  They're gone.  I see them laughing down the hallway.  And I'm just sitting there.  Five minutes goes by.  I'm like, oh, God.  And then I looked in the barrel.  Oh, yeah.  This wasn't even in the bathroom.  This was in the barrel.  In the garbage can.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it wasn't like I had a suite.  It was a regular room.  So he had to be in front of her doing whatever he did.  Briefly.  To make that happen.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't like a roll of toilet paper out there, either.  It looked like a giant U.  I was so proud of myself. 
[02:10:00]  I forgot that I put it back onto the desk.  The letter or the animal.  Oh, my God.  Hey, uh...  We're running out of show, and we got the angry events from last night.  Oh, goody.  Our own Sam was there, and his afro was prominently displayed.  Wow, look at that.  During the broadcast.  Sam was in the front row.  We're going to put the pictures up on onaradio.com.  There he is in that picture.  But all I saw on my TV was one afro popping out from the bottom of the screen the entire 
[02:10:30]  time that they did the 15th anniversary of Raw last night.  The world's strongest man, Mark Henry, actually complimented me on it when he walked past me.  Really?  Yes.  He did.  Yes, he did.  We're in the middle of afro wars, and we're just kicking Ryan and Fez's ass.  I mean, let's be honest.  I know.  Dave can't even...  Dave looks like he just got a haircut.  Yeah.  It's not even resembling an afro.  But Vince came out, and Vince McMahon did Angry Vince, but he did Anthony's version  of Angry Vince.  I'm honored.  Even though he's Angry Vince. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Listen to this.  I just thought of Anthony.  That's it.  It was like, what is Vince doing?  He's listening to this show, obviously.  I hate you.  And all the rest of you people can go straight to hell.  That's how you do it.  Wait a minute.  That's your impression.  That's hysterical.  Because we picked up on the Angry Vince, and obviously does a great Angry Vince, but 
[02:11:30]  Ant's little take on it is to completely exaggerate at the end like that.  Wow.  He is now doing you.  He absolutely did that impression.  You started doing him, but now he's doing you.  He's diffused my impression, that bastard.  That genius.  Please get a seasoned assist.  Yeah.  We can't do it anymore.  Right.  Go to hell.  That's how Ant does it, right?  I mean, they get all the clips.  We send them all the clips, and then they tell us that Vince McMahon loves them. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  How about Vince calls our show and tells us himself?  I love to talk to Vince.  He used to be on our show all the time.  I hate you.  I hate you.  And all the rest of you people can go straight to hell.  That's Anthony.  I'm telling you.  What is he doing?  Isn't that weird?  Oh, that is funny.  Yeah, that's flattering.  It certainly is. 
[02:12:30]  You guys must have had a blast, huh?  Hold on really fast.  I don't care.  Because Fancy Man is drunk.  I wasn't even going to talk to him about it.  Who cares?  From XM Radio Gold, he writes, Vince is doing Anthony doing Vince the same way Christopher  Walken is now doing Jay Moore doing Christopher Walken.  Yeah, somewhere along the line, Christopher Walken got confused how he sounds and started  doing the exaggerated version.  Doing the Jay Moore version of himself.  Yep.  And I think that's what's happening with Vince.  All right.  That's funny.  Oh, there's the musical little note.  Hey, Bobby, what are we promoting today? 
[02:13:00]  This week, December 14th, I'm doing the Playboy Comedy Tour at Lakewood Theater in Dallas.  Go to Ticketmaster.com for tickets.  There's going to be Playboy Girls there.  What do they call them?  Playmates?  Funny.  Yeah, Playmates.  There's a bunch of girls.  What do they call the young girls there?  Playmates.  Tomatoes.  Tomatoes.  Tomatoes.  So it's going to be a hot show.  Come down.  Lakewood Theater.  With fine stems.  Gams.  And robertkellylive.com for all your days, right?  Robertkellylive.com.  And you stink, too, if you want to play the general. 
[02:13:30]  Ah, yes.  Call of Duty 4.  And his clan name is G-A-A-Y.  Mine is Ku Klux.  Is it really?  No.  Oh, okay.  Come on.  Let me ring.  There we go.  You never know when you know.  Ring-a-ding-ding.  You do know with him, actually.  Yes, my name is Noodle.  My name is Noodles on there.  But I don't belong to a clan.  You do?  I'll be in your clan.  You're going to be lowercase.  G-A-A-Y-S. 
[02:14:00]  Gays.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  By the way, Jimmy, you're talking to a general.  Yes, he's a general.  Bob Kelly's a general online.  Two-star.  A two-star general.  Yeah.  He had a brag about that right out of the box today.  I made sergeant last night.  What do you think, Jimmy?  You didn't make sergeant.  You didn't make sergeant.  What, the nerd army?  Jimmy's a two-star general down in the meatpacking district.  Oh.  No, I'm not.  Should have said rear admiral, stupid.

[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Dark, dark black.  Oh.  Ah, right.  Okay.  The Pepto does that to me.  And it did look like a fucking black snake.  And it was massive.  And it slid out of my anus.  See, when you said slide down, I always thought you were saying like the mudslides.  Oh, no, I know, I know, but you can't describe shit over there sometimes.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Literally.  Sometimes.  Ever.  But no, I went into the bathroom and I thought I was just having just a regular movement. 
[02:19:00]  A baby?  Right, right.  No, it wasn't even that.  Yeah.  Like a regular movement.  Maybe, maybe like, let's talk about maybe a four or five incher.  Normal size.  Just a quick little.  It's kind of small.  Just like a, actually.  That's what.  A log.  Let's put it this way.  That's what I thought was going on.  And then when I looked, I was like, what?  This thing must have just slid out.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Can I tell you the joy of, of, when Bob Kelly was in his bathroom of shitting into his 
[02:19:30]  waste paper basket in Vegas?  Because she's encouraging me.  She's like, you got to do it.  Um, and so I, I, I, it was a perfect, he had just checked into the room, pristine white,  like the baggie was still like, you know how like when you go to a hotel.  It still smelled like, uh, like, uh, lemon or whatever.  Cause it was probably one of those scented, you know, plastic bags.  It also hadn't been pushed all the way down into the bucket because it hadn't even been,  nothing had been thrown in yet.  And my fucking log fell in there. 
[02:20:00]  It was, it was like a fucking severed arm, like a lightsaber had cut off a fucking brown  arm and it just fell into there.  And then I put it back under his thing.  I'm like, oh, I know dummy will be smelling that soon.  That's awesome.  It was wonderful.  Uh, we got some XM news.  Oh, really?  The one I know I could talk about, I, I was, I just got to communicate Jim Norton's  unmasked this Saturday on one 50.  Oh, cool.  Oh, that just, uh, hit the old XM wire.  Jim Norton unmasked with, uh, Ronnie B, uh, this Saturday on one 50. 
[02:20:30]  Let's spread the word on that one, people.  Excellent.  And then there's something, um, with, uh, how do I, uh, should I even say iTunes?  Uh, well, there's something going on with iTunes, but I don't know if it's official yet.  And, uh, maybe someone could call, someone call Elo and, and see if we, if he wants to  talk about it yet.  Maybe he could, how about he jumps on the freaking phone and tells the peeps? 
[02:21:00]  That's what we do today.  Come on.  Elo.  Uh, yeah.  Someone get Logan on the phone.  Let him, uh, break the news if it's official yet.  It's a pretty cool thing they're doing.  And I want to give props to our own, uh, uh, uh, uh, Mike there.  Uh, uh, the, uh, what do we call him?  Madonna Mike?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  He was all over TMZ, uh, last night.  Really?  Oh, really?  Well, they did a story on Madonna, like walking through the airport and there was our boy right 
[02:21:30]  next to Madonna.  I mean, a lot of coverage of Mike last night on TMZ.  And I, uh, I, I sent him a email and he's like, God, that you're like the fifth or sixth  person that emailed me on this, but it was obvious.  It was, it was, it was Mike Cole.  I was hoping he got busted in a, in a toilet with George Michael with something really scandalous.  I want to talk about that thing, but we need Logan.  We need Logan to give the details on that thing.  All right.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  We don't know what we can say or not say about that.  Is that what it is?  Well, it's going to be, Ooh, it's going to be something.  What's going on working on it.  Okay.  In the meantime, we got more audio of Zeppelin from last night.  Oh, for the new one.  Yes.  Good.  Thank God.  Jimmy missed this whole, this whole thing.  I don't want to hear any more old Zeppelin, uh, tainting people, making them think that  they actually sound like this because here's what's going to happen.  They're going to go on tour because it was a big success and everybody's crowing about 
[02:22:30]  this and they're going to come here to the U S and the tickets will sell out in immediately.  We won't even be able to get tickets because people think they're going to go see Zeppelin.  They're not.  Why are you such a party pooper?  Because I, it's like I said before, you're making everybody sad.  It's, it's like when you go to a museum and you see the, the woolly mammoth.  Yeah.  It's still cool.  Yeah.  But you don't, you could look at it and you're like, wow, that's cool.  It's a woolly mammoth, but you don't have to see him like, like do the thing. 
[02:23:00]  You just know it's a woolly mammoth.  Wow.  Are you feeling all right today?  I'm fine.  Okay.  Uh, that's what people are getting all infatuated with is the fact that they're just seeing Led  Zeppelin on stage.  Infatuated with the, yes, but, but now it sounds like, I know I'm going to lose this  because I know I'm Jimmy's a huge Sabbath fan. 
[02:23:30]  So I'm screwed today.  But what's the argument?  I can't fight both of you.  I think it's still cool to see Zeppelin.  I wouldn't disagree.  To finally see Zeppelin after 28 years.  I think it's cool as hell.  I wouldn't disagree with that.  Uh, there, uh, why, why though?  It's like, it's not, you're not hearing it like it was, it's, it's supposed to sound.  See, you won't lose this argument with me because I, Ozzy hasn't sounded like the record since  1968.  So I love that.  I kind of like a live element to it as long as you can tell what song it is. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  I know.  I live element is fine.  No, we got a fine, not, not as badly as, as they're pulling this off.  He doesn't sound like Robert Plant.  You know what bit we got to do?  I don't know if it's, I don't know if it'll, it'll work, but it sounds good on paper.  I talk about it every once in a while.  I saw Dylan back in 19, uh, it's called 90, 91 probably.  And, uh, he was, he was singing very famous Bob Dylan songs, but you had no fucking idea.  Oh yeah.  No clue what they were.  I don't know if we can find live Bob Dylan to the point where we can play, guess what 
[02:24:30]  Bob Dylan song he's singing.  Cause he completely, cause how you were joking about Zeppelin changing it around a little  bit today.  He is the king of changing around his songs to the point.  You're like, this is like a rolling stone.  What?  You don't even know until you, you hear like the chorus.  That's nothing but annoying.  The whole beat and the whole arrangement is completely different.  It's so annoying.  The lyrics, he's calling it a rock with wheels. 
[02:25:00]  Right.  That's that thing.  All right.  But from last night, the first time in 28 years, uh, pretty much the entire band, more  or less.  Except for, you know, the dead Bonham.  And John Bonham's drumming was just amazing.  And Jason Bonham is an asshole.  Is he a good drummer though?  I've met him over the years.  He's an asshole.  Yeah, sure he is.  What band was he in for a while?  Calm the fuck down.  We get it.  You're John Bonham's son.  Huh?  I was like, what band was he in for a while?  Didn't they have a hit?  Oh, it was called Bonham.  Yeah.  Well, here we go.  Here's a little taste of cashmere. 
[02:25:30]  Here.  That actually wasn't that bad. 
[02:26:00]  This is, this is from someone's cell phone, by the way.  That wasn't that bad.  This is from someone's cell phone.  Yeah, I don't mind that.  A live, cause you gotta get-  Fucking Bobby.  What happened, Bobby?  He had 60.  Bobby.  I was trying to drink my smoothie and Bobby just, he just casually turned his iPhone toward  me and he had taken a picture of his dump.  Oh, is that what that was?  Is this a brand new dump?  No, it's cute.  Ew.  Let me see it.  It's disgusting.  I like it that has the rust.  Let me see it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got one of those, uh, it's a, it's, you got rust in your shit. 
[02:26:30]  It's not.  It's rust.  It's shiny.  It has shit rust.  It's shiny.  I have rusty shit.  What is that from?  Is that from Lodes?  By the way, by the way, someone's like, uh, we just did this.  Where are, where have you been?  Justin from Hoboken.  You guys need to get the audio from raw last night.  I've been saying, I hate you.  And the rest of you can go straight there.  What the hell's wrong with you?  We just did that.  Where were you?  Listen to the replay. 
[02:27:00]  We did the whole thing.  Uh, here's another part of the, um, uh, of cashmere.  This is from a cell phone.  And I think Danny was pointing it out to us, uh, when we were in break that, uh, the guy  wants to sing high with, uh, plant and realizes plant decided not to sing the high note.  And then this guy, cause you could, I guess you could hear him on this recording.  Just stop singing and you could hear sort of a disappointment, uh, going on here.  Uh, whatever. 
[02:27:30]  So, ah, that would have been cool. 
[02:28:00]  I still think it would be very cool to see them live.  Yeah.  I would go see them live.  Absolutely.  You have to.  But we got our picture, though.  Yeah, that's right.  The only one I don't have is John Paul Jones, by the way.  Well, I don't have John Bottom, honestly.  You got a page?  No.  I got a page from back in the day.  Go to his tombstone.  When I was working for the home of rock and roll of Rochester, New York.  That home of rock and roll?  Rock and roll moves a lot.  I worked for three homes of rock and roll.  I worked for the Buffalo version.  I worked for the Rochester version. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  And I worked for the Long Island version.  Ah.  Three homes of rock and roll under my belt.  Here's a question about pictures.  What's cooler?  A picture with plant and page together or Fiona Apple?  Let's see.  Fiona from years ago when she was singing.  Criminal, yes.  Criminal.  She was crawling like a junkie.  I was all prepared to really start thinking it over and kind of figuring it out in my own brain. 
[02:29:00]  And then you went the other way.  Hey, let's go to Anthony in Connecticut.  Anthony!  Hi!  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  My dad paid $90 a ticket to see Dylan about two weeks ago.  And he said five songs in, half the crowd left.  Like, it was a baseball game and it was 9-0 in the third inning.  Because people just gave up.  They couldn't understand one word he was saying.  Yeah, can we find some live Dylan?  I love Dylan, but I don't know.  There's something going on.  He has to be too cool for the room or something. 
[02:29:30]  They said it's like hit and miss.  Sometimes you go and you see him and it's the greatest show you've ever seen.  And then other times you can't understand one word.  Dude, I swear to God.  Some of these songs, he was three quarters done.  And then I went, oh my God, that's subterranean homesick blues.  Okay.  See you later, guys.  Bye.  We need examples, though, to help the bit.  I'm so not familiar with Dylan.  I can only explain it, you know, enough before people don't give a shit.  I love that Manny kicked him out of the wah.  Yes, yes.  What?  The old owner of the comedy cellar. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, Cafe Fiend John.  He wouldn't let him play.  He said he stunk.  Manny Dwarman in the 60s owned, he was the seller.  He owned Cafe Fiend John, which is the original comedy cellar.  And the artist would come in and play like, like in the, in, they would just kind of play  in the fucking 60s.  But he would never let Bob Dylan in.  He goes, I thought he was a kind of a pretentious, like rich kid.  He kind of had him pegged in a way.  Like he thought he was like, he didn't realize how talented he was.  And Dylan actually mentioned Manny in his fucking biography twice.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty cool. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Fucking Manny.  It's funny.  He lets me and Bob Kelly play this joint, but not Bob Dylan.  It looks like a bad move, Manny.  Dope.  Let's go to Arthur in New Hampshire.  Arthur.  Morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Arthur.  How are you?  Fine.  I don't know if you can find it, but Dylan was on a David Letterman best of show.  I want to say when he was back on NBC.  Okay.  He did like a Rolling Stone live.  Okay. 
[02:31:00]  And if you can understand one word, you're lucky.  But if you can get a copy of it, it's the most horrendous recording I've ever heard.  Really?  All right.  We'll try to find that, too.  Thank you, Arthur.  I like those awful recordings.  Huh?  I like those awful recordings that you catch people doing.  Like the Linda McCartney thing.  Oh, yeah.  Led Zeppelin.  I think E-Rock's got it.  Led Zeppelin.  We got Like a Rolling Stone from Bob Dylan live.  All right.  Now you don't talk so loud. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, this was a man.  It's not that bad.  Now you don't seem so proud.  Yeah.  But I haven't the best ground in your life.  Yeah, yeah.  For your name's to me.  How does it feel?  How does it feel?  It was aim bad.  Yeah, it's fine.  Thanks for proving my point, E-Rock.  You're a true soldier of the show.  Good job, E-Rock.  Way to go.  Why not listen to it first instead of just humiliating? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, way to debunk everything I just said for the last 20 minutes.  That sounded nothing like Dylan.  I would never like to go see a historic guy like that singing and sounding like that.  Wait, E-Rock's going to what?  Oh.  What did you say?  You understood that?  I understood.  Oh, my God.  The point I was making, you could tell it's Like a Rolling Stone.  I went to a show.  You didn't even know he was doing Like a Rolling Stone.  That, you know, it was like a Rolling Stone, but he was mumbling.  Everyone knows that he mumbles. 
[02:32:30]  That's not what I'm getting at.  I'm talking about how he rearranges his songs to a point you don't even know what song he's playing.  Hold on.  Eric wanted to correct you in front of two countries again.  Go ahead, Eric.  I didn't want to correct him.  I was just saying a lot of the live stuff that's in here all sounds like the recorded stuff.  It's just his vocals are horrible.  So, basically, he's saying I was wrong today?  How about the Eric and Anthony show?  Is that what you think it should be?  Why don't you just spit on Oak?  I would never take that, Oak.  Matter, E-Rock?  Not in my room. 
[02:33:00]  Try to do a bit, and all of a sudden, he's fucking coming and just wrecking it on purpose.  Yeah.  He probably had a clip where he sounded nothing like it, and he goes, no, that will just help him.  By the way, E-Rock, I was going to do 20 minutes on this today, so maybe you should do the next 20 minutes of radio, because now I have nothing.  Yeah.  What do you want to talk about?  Eric, what do you want to talk about?  E-Rock?  The Millennium Hulk Hogan?  Why didn't you go to the Raw last night with Sam?  It was a big shoe.  Exactly.  Front row.  I know.  Too far. 
[02:33:30]  It's not too far.  It was an hour and a half each way.  I wasn't going to do it.  Not too busy.  What were you doing, writing down ways you could embarrass Hulk?  You know that Hulk was there, too.  I know.  You would have been able to meet Hulk?  You know, one of your heroes.  Yeah?  We're live, Eric.  Nothing, Eric.  Can you contribute to a...  No, I can't.  Mm-hmm.  All right, maybe I can try doing my bit. 
[02:34:00]  Do we have the David Letterman?  Yeah, I don't know how it sounds, though.  Oh, great.  I'll watch it be a pristine recording.  I know.  Why don't I just go home?  What button do I push?  The PC sound?  I think so, yeah.  All right, hit it.  Here's the Letterman thing that God is just talking about.  What is this? 
[02:34:30]  Oh, hurricane.  I heard him say hurricane, but it doesn't sound like.  Do they know what I'll talk?  I don't know what song this is. 
[02:35:00]  Junkerman.  What is it?  Is this?  This sounds okay.  Oh, well, that's not a Dylan classic.  Oh, forget it.  Just forget it.  I had to bring something to the show finally and I failed.  Measurably.  No, he didn't.  Iraq let you down.  He sabotaged what you're doing.  Just forget it.  Why don't you just play the studio version and applaud behind it?  Derek actually had to go in there and school him.  Derek hasn't been in that room in a year and a half. 
[02:35:30]  We have another live cut of Dylan.  Oh, boy.  Oh, good.  Here's another pristine gem.  So you felt like you didn't do a good enough job and you really want to hammer the point  home that I was wrong.  Okay, good.  This is where I was told the point first.  Oh, no, no problem.  Go ahead, Iraq.  Now you're not even playing music.  You're just playing De Niro babbling at the end of Cape Fear. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, this is kind of more in the line I was talking.  I was talking.  Oof.  There's many here in the world.  I feel that life is but a joke.  I can't have you do that. 
[02:36:30]  Today is not my day.  Let us knock the faucet and I didn't know that I was in the land.  This is all along the watchtower.  Is that what this was?  Yeah.  Should it be Hendrix's song?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:37:00]  There it is.  I swear, until you said it and then he just said that, I had no clue.  Yeah.  This is what I'm getting at.  This is more like it.  Listen for a little more.  As had in his hands.  What?  Huh?  See what I mean? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  You now know it's all along the watchtower but...  And I'll be honest.  I like when one artist does another artist's song.  Yeah, sure.  Like when Elvis does like Sweet Caroline or certain...  I like that.  But this is too weird.  Yeah.  Hey, what was that Elvis thing we played?  I wrote it down in my book that we needed to replay it.  Laughing Elvis.  Do we got Laughing Elvis? 
[02:38:00]  Oh, God, yeah.  Where he's laughing through the whole song.  Dude, that made me just laugh my ass off.  Yeah.  I wrote it once.  Yep.  If you watch...  I forgot why.  I think Stephen S. from Bayshore...  What were we doing that we found laughing Elvis?  I think it was Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Yeah.  Well, he's the Elvis expert.  Yeah.  When you watch Elvis...  Elvis was so great because his jokes were fucking awful.  He would...  Like, these are people that would have eaten his shit and he was bombing in front of them.  I know.  It was...  Once in a while, he'd have a good one.  He's like, I'd like to introduce my band. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh, John, this is Ronnie.  Ronnie, this is John.  Like, you know, just...  And that got like a nice chuckle.  But he would fucking throw some...  You've never heard a fucking icon throw duds.  He had no writer at all.  He was just winging it on pills and shit.  They really did...  There was one movie they did on HBO where he actually went out and walks through the crowd  during every show when he used to do the international casino.  Yeah.  He would make out with every chick.  Not kiss. 
[02:39:00]  He would tongue kiss.  Really?  And guys would be pushing their wives.  Go, go, get a tongue kiss.  And then he'd grab them and just open mouth kiss every woman he walked by.  Wow.  Hey, we're really dumb here on the show.  What happened?  All right.  We'll admit when we're wrong.  What happened?  Dylan actually wrote all along the Watchtower.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know that.  I don't think I knew that.  But we know Hendrix's version better.  Hendrix made it a massive song.  I did not know that.  Did you know that?  Yeah, I did know that. 
[02:39:30]  I swear.  All right.  I did know that.  But I didn't recognize it at all.  Okay.  Here's Laughing Elves.  Maybe.  Hendrix changed it.  I don't know what the...  Okay, just...  Here we go.  So many drugs.  Yeah.  So many drugs.  Yeah.  I wonder how...  And the band just keeps going...  Oooh!  So many drugs.  Yeah.  I wonder...  You know, someone said...  The world's a stage.  You need to play a part.  So...  so many drugs 
[02:40:00]  and the band just keeps going  the world's a stage and he's supposed to play a part  oh god 
[02:40:30]  I had no cause to die  thank you baby 
[02:41:00]  shall I come back  again  tell me dear  are you lost  is your heart  still with pain  shall I come back  again  tell me dear  are you lost 
[02:41:30]  that's great  sing it baby  he's so much fun to watch  cause like  here's the ultimate sex symbol  and he's like  almost like  not taking himself seriously  like  he's clowning all the time  like that  like he's  like  there's a version of  suspicious minds  which is a great song  where it's like  and if an old friend I know  and it's supposed to be  he stops by to say hello  but he throws in  if an old friend I know 
[02:42:00]  shove it up your nose  and just fucking  no one laughs  he maybe gets a one  or a two  from somebody in the back  cause they want to hear the song  but he didn't care  he would just clown around  he was great  just a guy having that much fun  and not taking that whole  fucking shit seriously  plus he probably had a  four week fucking  like a fried banana sandwich  along to this colon  let's go to  Mongo the trucker  what are you hauling Mongo  oversize air ducts 
[02:42:30]  I'm hauling propane  I'm hauling Jimmy Dean sausage  are you hauling over ice  or ground  sausage  sausage  I think we should have  Iraq do the  cinnamon challenge  you ever heard of it  what's the cinnamon challenge  I hope it involves an axe  take one tablespoon

[03:08:30]  down there  on top of your vocal cords  your vocal cords  actually will close  completely shut  and it's called laryngospasm  and yeah  you can  you can freaking die from that  if you get too much shit down there  so then why  why is cinnamon legal  cause you're not supposed to take  a tablespoon of it  I'm not even joking  like I  I remember as a kid  like  like  I would like to eat cinnamon  no  I swear to god  you never ate cinnamon like that  maybe cinnamon sugar I guess  cinnamon sugar you can eat  what's going on boys  alright  wait sir 
[03:09:00]  what other powders will do that  any kind of powders like that  as soon as you put it in your mouth  and you take a breath  it just goes right down  into your lungs  and then it causes  bronchospasms  down in your lungs  now E-Rock's gonna feel like shit  the rest of the day  cause that stuff is down  still in his lungs  he's gonna be coughing that crap up  the rest of the day  is he gonna be alright though  yeah he'll be fine  what about sperm  is that okay  sperm  I don't know  alright boys  punch you now  have a good day  oh it'll be on the website

[03:13:30]  it was uncalled for  I felt a smidge  would be acceptable  just to make E-Rock's tongue  go tingle  tingle  you had it filled  to the tippy top  you knew the risks  you knew the risks  hang on one second  no I didn't  first of all  yes you did  he said heaping  you would be the one  you would be doing  the most jail time  let's just put it that way  let me tell you something  I wouldn't do any  you actually  gave him the spoon of cinnamon  yep  we wouldn't do any  you said open his mouth  yep  you said open your mouth  E-Rock  yes you're right about that  you did say that  but you said heaping  Opie  Opie 
[03:14:00]  did you  did you  or did you not say heaping  I've seen stable boys  Opie  what  did you  or did you not say heaping  prove it  it's recording  yeah  prove it  yeah  listen to the replay  prove it  prove it  prove it  you know what  the fuck thing  you cocksucker  you would throw me  out of the bus  you would  just for the show  to keep going  prove it  you'd do interviews  from jail with me 
[03:14:30]  this is what  you're going to hear  later today  what happens to that  cinnamon challenge thing  they did this morning  hey can we see the video  I want to see the  yeah  yeah  let's  let's  let's see that  fucking video  let's go to the videotape  oh you're right there  hopefully the  grim reaper  oh  no  you feel better now  he really did look like  those old school  Asian wrestlers  that used to use  the smoke  here's what  we need somebody  to do  take E-Rock  into the bathroom  and splash some 
[03:15:00]  water on your face  you know  that'll cool you down  a little bit  and not for the sake  and  always laughing  because your eyes  are like  oh look  you're coughing  though right  yeah  why are you out of breath  because I just  coughed up another  chunk of cinnamon  oh  he's got black  long  how could cinnamon  be so delicious  on like  french toast  or ice cream  because it's  they put sugar in it  yeah but then  it's so deadly  it's not  it's not whole cinnamon  you gotta go put  water on your eyes 
[03:15:30]  to cool that stuff down  so you don't get  the capillaries broke  by the way  tall babies  helping me out  when Opie said  heaping  he was referring  to Bob Kelly  oh  that's a good one  I'm not gonna  I'm not gonna fight it  I mean  it was a little  mean spirited  Jim I think  should we take a break  imagine doing that  to your girlfriend  just to get a laugh  and she chokes  to death  how stupid you feel  I could even comprehend that  we do our  we do our research 
[03:16:00]  we saw a hot chick  on YouTube do it  she was fine in the end  seemed like she was fine  if a girl could do it  she did a bigger teaspoon  she did a teaspoon of it  yeah  and they always  we did a teaspoon  always  you could watch  every single one  of those tapes  the first thing is  poof  and this big cloud  of brown smoke  comes out of their mouth  Vinny from Brooklyn  Vinny  hey what's going on guys  hey  that is some of the  funniest shit  I've ever heard  on the radio  and I've been listening  to you guys forever  you know the reason  why I bought XM  and that's it 
[03:16:30]  I think you should  throw some robot  tussling on E-Rock's face  it might help him out  a little bit  alright thank you  his eyes are really red  E-Rock  go cool you down  your capital eyes  yes  you want to see  the video Ant  oh yeah  Jimmy  hell yeah  show those guys  oh I gotta see it  and we gotta replay  the audio after the break  E-Rock where you going  we gotta watch you  yeah  could someone follow E-Rock  okay that's good  ah where  alright 
[03:17:00]  here it is  oh  there's a cinnamon  going in  it's  instantly  causing  out  there's a big cloud  you can see the cloud  in the video  yeah  big cloud  and just  he's not looking good  at all  with the sound  it really makes it too  he is  he's clutching his chest  another huge cloud  this is after he inhaled  and exhaled  a couple of times  so it wasn't just 
[03:17:30]  what was in his mouth  he coughed  and another huge cloud  of cinnamon came out  and now  now the  the puking part  the  just fluid  dripping from his mouth  it's not even like  puking  it's just this  viscous  ugh  dripping out of his mouth  now he tries to  he's trying to take  a swig of water  but his body  will not allow it  his body's not having  he's trying to talk  people are saying  he's gotta rinse out  his eyes  why  the cinnamon could  like irritate 
[03:18:00]  the tear ducts  and stuff  his eyes are tearing  like crazy  he's fine  he's frying cinnamon  he's the gingerbread man  do you realize  who you hired  he's a disruptive  influence  anthony  he happens to be  a dwarf  what horrible  people  our new bosses  said you guys  can get as crazy  as you want  they keep creating  new ways to celebrate  mediocrity  opi and anthony show  it's psychotic

[03:20:00]  dave out  i don't want to  see east side  dave get hurt  because you'd  never know  because he's red  he'd look normal  we'll uh  play uh  iraq doing the  cinnamon challenge  uh before we get  out of here  in a little bit  but first uh  sexual pleasure  the buttocks  and the anus  the buttocks  and the anus  sexual pleasure  not sure what year  this is from  but the narrator  reminds me  that would be  danny rightness  of alan funt  talking about the  buttocks and the  anus  sexual pleasure 
[03:20:30]  pleasure  pleasure  candid camera  buttocks are one  of the major  erogenous zones  of women  and it is a  known fact that  man's greatest  pleasure is in the  natural parts of a  woman and second  only to the female  breast the buttocks  are a visual turn on  not too many years  ago the buttocks  were taboo as a  sex object  this is don  kirschner  for don kirschner's  rock concert  and now casey and  the sunshine band  will play as  i fondle his 
[03:21:00]  buttocks  could there have  been a worse  less charismatic  host than don  kirschner  yeah  oh boy was he a  dull fella  he started videos  though  oh he was great  he started mtv  he was  i mean not mtv  but the fact that  what am i trying  to say  i don't know  fuck it  i need to pick  out a tv for  christmas  flat screen  go with the  40  all right let's  go back to this  the buttocks  who as a sex  object  now with 
[03:21:30]  permissive sex  attitudes  penetration from  the rear  and anal lingus  are considered  perfectly normal  anal sexual  practices  play as much  a part in  heterosexual  relationships  as in  homosexual  ones  many men  as well as  women  are stimulated  by the  contemplation  of the  posterior  they also  like to  include this  part of the  body  in their  sexual  practices  the buttocks  the anus  and the  ridge between  the actual  sex organs  perineum  are among 
[03:22:00]  the most  erogenous zones  in both men  and women  in spite of  this  anal eroticism  is still  subjected  to many  taboos  however  with today's  more permissive  sexual attitudes  heterosexual  anal intercourse  is being  more widely  practiced  by young  people  hmm  all right  that guy  by the way  that guy talking  he's the worst  person alive  why this is  fantastic way  to talk about  anal lingus  anal lingus 
[03:22:30]  he's wonderful  wonderful  wonderful  i like to call it  the car wash  the prostate massage  inside your  asshole  and the posterior  and when she's  rubbing the back  of your leg  if her finger  brushes where the  shit comes out  it's going to be  a sexual massage  can you dig it  i knew that you  could  tony will you  dance with me  if she drapes you  and her finger  does not go near  the posterior  you're probably  going to be  ripped off  for eighty dollars  but if her  fingernail  comes out 
[03:23:00]  and there's a  little bit of  shit underneath  the nail  be prepared to  hand over  another hundred  now let's view  two girls  one cup  this one  topping the charts  this week  this is how  the posterior  is emptied  before anal lingus  or anal stimulation  is  noticed  that her  asshole  opens  like a  dolphin's  pee hole  let's talk  about gaping  huge gaping  assholes  can be fun  i said 
[03:23:30]  pee hole  i suck  that doesn't  pee hole  whatever  let's learn  more  you should  know  you have  one  chubsy  unsweatier  girls  this area  will smell  like an  armpit  rub your  hand under  your own  armpit  to get  the odor  in on it  put it  in her  vagina  if she  screams  bloody  murder  her pussy  is tainted 
[03:24:00]  ask her  what she's  eaten  first  at times  you will  go to  stimulate  the  posterior  and feel  like you  fell into  a sink  hole  over a  septic  tank  make sure  she has  not eaten  ethnic  food  if she  has  pomegranate  seeds  hanging from  her  asshole  those are  hemorrhoids  stay away  she should  be well  groomed in  the rear  area  it should  not look  like a  sea urchin  eating a  guppy  be careful  while having 
[03:24:30]  anal sex  that you  do not  pull out  too quickly  and get  the pink  sock  where it  looks like  the pool  lining of  the asshole  is gripping  your cock  and pulling  it back  in  pink sock  is always  funny  it looks  like the  asshole  has a  proboscis  you want  to learn  more or  what  if you  can't  get your  pink sock  back in  just get  on all  fours  walk  backwards  and make  elephant  noises  try to 
[03:25:00]  pick up  peanuts  until your  asshole  has receded  you'll know  she's pink  socking  if her  asshole  looks like  an odd  vark  that's the  first word  in the  dictionary  because it  starts  with two  a's  like  asshole  which is  what I  am  can we  learn more  about the  buttocks  and the  anus  police  the latest  survey shows  that nearly  one quarter  of all  females  and more  than one  quarter  of all  males  and more  than one 
[03:25:30]  quarter  of married  couples  under 35  had performed  anal intercourse  at least once  in the last  year  now what this  means is that  at least three  quarters have  said if you  touch my  asshole I'm  divorcing you  if you stick  your dick in  her asshole  and pull it  out and squeeze  the tip of  your dick  and shit  comes out  like a  plate of  spaghetti maker  jesus  christ  you want  to perform  an enema  on your  dirty  wife's  asshole  I don't  mind people  doing an  impression of  me but  when Robert  does it he 
[03:26:00]  makes me  sound like  blair's  cousin  jerry  this guy  rules  the act  itself is  relatively safe  and sanitary  if proper  precautions  and good  hygiene  are exercised  many couples  find anal  intercourse  exciting  pleasurable  and different 
[03:26:30]  and if both  partners consent  they should feel  free to participate  naturally  thorough washing  is appropriate  and lubricants  should be applied  to the penis  and to the anal  opening  this is most  important to  facilitate entry  if vaginal  intercourse  is contemplated  directly after  anal intercourse  the penis  should be  thoroughly washed  to prevent  feckle bacteria  in the rectum  from contaminating  the vagina  and causing  possible infection 
[03:27:00]  infection  then please  call me  your accountant  and I'll get  you poppy bonds  no double  dipping in  the vagina  and the asshole  it's very much  like eating  chips  at a dinner  party  it really is  all of a sudden  it's going to  look like you're  gardening  and then put  your hands  in the mayonnaise  jar  this last clip  this was a 
[03:27:30]  video documentary  but Danny  can't find  the actual  video  what I'd find  is the audio  but apparently  this was a  video documentary  and this track  kind of  would probably  be better  with the  accompanying video  but I think  it works quite well  on its own  does he have a mustache  because what you're  going to hear  is him describing  what he's watching  one quarter  of all married  couples engage  in anal sex  which means  that the other  75% need  a Vicodin 
[03:28:00]  crushed up  and put in  their supper  when they fall asleep  straddle them  like the horses  that they are  and put it  where the duty  comes out  deny it  in the morning  tell us  you had a bad  dream  get gauze  and put it  on the asshole  you're lucky  that was funny  fall asleep  did I say that  and then you  fucked some other  word up  well I don't  know  I don't talk  too good  fall asleep  and when I  said see  I was thinking  what her asshole  will do  with your semen 
[03:28:30]  clicky  pudding and  cream  parfait  feed her  chili  the night  before  see if you  can find  the kidney  bean skins  the next  day  when she  sneezes  her asshole  will look  like  E-Rock  coughing up  cinnamon  poor E-Rock  as you can  see  there are  anatomical  differences  in the shape  and size  of the various  models  buttocks  and the  camera's  sharp eye  gives you 
[03:29:00]  an unbelievable  close up  of the  positioning  between the  anal canal  and the  vaginal canal  see the  very important  this one  right here  the small  pink one  belongs to  a healthy  married woman  and this  larger one  with the  donkey's  taking tourists  into the  middle of  it  belongs to  a gay  man  in new  york city  if you  want to  know about  anal sex  talk to  dr  zeidberg  he will  teach you  that's right  i am actually 
[03:29:30]  the only doctor  who is less  pleasant than  dr zell  this guy's  a creep  what is he  looking at  fucking video  of assholes  he loves  the butt  that's great  and the  anus  close up  of the  positioning  between the  anal canal  and the  vaginal canal  see the  very important  anatomical  and racial  differences  assholes  of the  female  buttocks  and vaginas  as these  attractive models  kneel  squat  bend over 
[03:30:00]  and assume  many other  rear entry  intercourse  positions  especially note  the camera shot  of the model  as she contracts  her sphincter muscle  and see her anal  opening contracting  at the same time  you are witnessing  the most revealing  cinematography  close up shots  shots revealing  the feminine  mystique  of the female  buttocks  yes  attractive buttocks  are a visual  turn on  and the buttocks  of both sexes  very often  favorably respond 
[03:30:30]  to erotic  caresses  massage  and other  forms of  stimulation  pay more  attention to the  buttocks  during lovemaking  and see what  happens  if your partner's  reaction is favorable  it's another  plus  that's wonderful  that is  I'd love to see  that footage  you're the most  amazing cinematography  ever  and now brought to you
