<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with their “F.U. Friday” segment, where listeners aired their grievances, ranging from workplace annoyances to sports team frustrations.  Anthony’s brother, Joe, was a guest in the studio throughout the show, providing musical interludes – often satirical song parodies riffing on current events like the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal, Hurricane Georges, and the O.J. Simpson trial.  

The show featured a lengthy discussion about Mike from Elmont, who claimed to have distributed 300 flyers promoting the show in Midtown Manhattan. Opie and Anthony debated the validity of this claim, taking calls to verify the story.  They also read a bizarre news item about a man injuring himself during sex with a vacuum cleaner, followed by humorous recollections of their childhoods, including anecdotes involving Joe’s early experimentation with marijuana.

Later in the broadcast, the hosts shared more listener “F.U.s” and further musical interludes from Joe, including a memorable parody titled "Frank Sinatra in the Morgue."  The show continued to weave together listener calls, humorous anecdotes, and commentary on current events and local news.

The final segment included thank-yous to producer Rick and to Mike from Elmont, who was invited to the studio for his promotional efforts.  Opie and Anthony challenged listeners to develop creative promotional ideas for a chance to be studio guests.  The show concluded with a repetitive song chanting "Give us a Lewinsky," a sexually suggestive reference to Monica Lewinsky.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York with Lonesome George Thorogood.  Good afternoon, it's F.U. Friday.  F.U.  Made it through another week here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  How you doing?  Pretty good, we got a little guest in the studio today.  A little guest?  Not a guest, he's my brother Joe.  Not little.  My brother Joe, he's not a guest.  He's a guest.  It's brother Joe.  He's the music behind all the wacky song parodies here.  I think he's the official music director of the Opie and Anthony Show.  We don't have much of a budget on the show, but Joe's the music director. 
[00:00:30]  He's the head of the Opie and Anthony Orchestra, which consists of him.  I'll do it for 10 bucks a week.  We'll give you a case of beer a week to be the music director.  You can sleep right here in the studio.  Yeah, that's good.  There you go.  I'll take it.  But Joe stopped by with his guitar, and we're going to sing some ditties today.  We're going to do some wacky tunes.  A lot of the faithful listeners enjoy all the song parodies that we've had on the show,  and between Joe and Anthony, they've pretty much done most of them.  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  So if you want to request one of the goofy songs you've heard on our show, you can do that today.  And it's FU Friday.  Yes.  It's your time to event.  You've been in hell all week.  Mm-hmm.  There's traffic this week.  Oof.  Yeah, I want to set a big F you out to the world leaders.  Can you guys go home?  We don't want you in our city anymore.  Why does the United Nations have to be here?  Because it's not like they walk here.  Yeah.  They all have to fly in.  No, no.  So put it somewhere in the Midwest where nobody's working.  Yeah.  And has to conduct business.  I don't mind that the U.N. is in New York City. 
[00:01:30]  I mind that these leaders go from the U.N. uptown to where we're at to go shopping.  Oh, because we're not working or anything, right?  Yeah, let's close down three or four blocks because Haji needs a South Park t-shirt to bring home with him.  I got the bloomies.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, they have to shut ten streets around where they're shopping.  Mm-hmm.  So no bombs go off, I guess, or whatever.  And you know the overtime these cops have got to be getting?  I know.  Oh.  And they're not catching any of the crack dealers this week because they're too busy, you know, on the corners around 57th, 56th Street. 
[00:02:00]  Escorting a world leader around.  Yeah.  Great.  Great.  Thank you.  Joe, you have any FUs to start the show today?  No, no FUs at all.  No.  Not this week.  Wow, you've had a pretty good week.  You had a good one.  I would like to give a shout-out to my peeps back at the crib in the hood.  The peeps.  My peeps.  Oh, my peeps.  Your flip-mo squad?  Actually, I want a shout-out to my flip-mo squad. 
[00:02:30]  And Joe, you got a flip-mo squad?  I got me a flip-mo squad.  All right, we're ready to rock, Brad.  The FUs can be sent in through the fax line is the easiest way because then it's right in front of us on a piece of paper.  We can read them real fast.  The fax line is 212-957-WNEW.  Phone line's going like crazy, so we don't have to give out that number.  Also, instant feedback is probably the easiest way because you don't even have to go to the fax machine.  You're at your computer.  You click on WNEW.com, which you should have bookmarked.  Yeah.  And click on our pictures, and you can instantly email us. 
[00:03:00]  Okay, very good.  Let me see if I can do that.  How do you do that so fast?  I don't know.  Anthony's quick.  The heroine.  Anthony's a professional now, Joe.  I know.  Isn't that funny?  You should email us at WNEW.com.  I can't.  No.  I just can't.  That's why you're still knocking 10.  I was knocking 10 four years ago.  I have an F-U.  He's F-U to my brother, Anthony.  Yeah, most of you guys used to knock 10, and now Anthony is a smooth operator on the radio. 
[00:03:30]  We're trying to get Joe out of that.  Yeah, we'll get Joe out of that.  If any band needs a guitar.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I need that.  I'll stay in 10, thank you.  Joe's up to two F-Us today.  Opie's on the list.  All right.  I was going to play the pipe song here, but we'll tease that.  We'll play that next, okay?  All right.  One of the songs that Joe came up with.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, yeah.  I'd like to make a dedication to the pipe song.  All right.  My dad's getting it today.  Your dad's getting the pipe?  As we speak. 
[00:04:00]  Why?  What's the matter with him?  No, it's that time, and he has to go get the pipe.  How old is he?  51.  Oh.  Wasn't this still?  I have no idea.  All I know is he ain't looking forward to it.  What's your dad's name?  Robert.  Robert, this one's for you.  That's what I want.  Good luck with the pipe!  Well, if you turn 53 and you find it hard to pee, you need the pipe.  You're having trouble with erection, got to shove it up your rectum, it's the pipe. 
[00:04:30]  Or if your pod stayed as well, we're going to photograph your home with the pipe.  Let's go!  Let's go catch the pipe.  Let's go catch the pipe.  Let's go catch the pipe.  Let's go catch the pipe.  Let's go catch the pipe.  Oh, God.  Let's go catch the pipe.  It's big, big and mean, there's a lot of Vaseline with the pipe.  And you'll know when it's rotten, so you feel your bugs part with the pipe.  You'll be barking like robo when the doctor bends you over with the pipe. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, let's go!  Let's go catch the pipe.  Let's go catch the pipe.  In your own hole, let's go get the bike.  In your own hole, let's go get the bike.  Bike, let's go get the bike.  Bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, bike.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  It's F.U. Friday with Everclear. 
[00:05:30]  I will buy you a new life.  And, Anthony, the faxes are coming in like crazy with F.U.'s.  I know.  Al writes, a big F.U. to the Cubs and Giants.  Let's go, Mets.  Very good.  I can't believe the Mets have to play the Braves for the final three games.  That's killing us.  It's not looking good for the Mets, Opie.  I'm sorry.  Don't say that, you Yankee skanky fan.  Yanks.  They've already clenched and saddened.  Now they're sitting out the rest of the season like hanging.  Boy, it doesn't matter.  Give me a fact.  Give me a fact about sports. 
[00:06:00]  Just give me like a joke.  No, no, you don't want to get us going.  We're better than Mike and the Mad Dog.  Joe is sports retarded.  My sports challenge.  You're even worse than Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Anthony is a genius compared to me.  Really?  Joe knows nothing.  I have nothing.  All right.  How many players?  I don't know.  How many players on the field?  I still don't know.  I get you, man.  But all I know is how bad.  Oh, this I do know.  McGuire.  Some bat, huh? 
[00:06:30]  Everyone knows that.  How's that?  You look pathetic.  I'm going to turn your mic off in a minute.  Who doesn't know Sosa, though, right?  Racer.  Sosa?  You're a racer.  You're a tie.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  He is good.  I'm getting better.  That's very good.  Yeah, but he thinks he's talking about football right now.  Actually, I know this home run race is a big deal because your wife knows, Anthony.  Jen doesn't know.  Jen is following the home run race, which is pretty interesting.  What do you got?  I got another FU from Desiree and Amy.  A big FU to our co-worker, Marion, who doesn't let us listen to WNEW while she's working because 
[00:07:00]  it's too much noise for her.  And another FU to her because she stinks up the bathroom.  She's gone today, so we're listening.  Keep it up.  You guys rock.  Girls don't do that, do they?  Do they stink up the bathroom?  Yeah, they do.  They're just nice about it, actually.  They spray something afterwards.  Yeah.  We got hundreds of...  All right.  Let's try this one real fast from Lynn.  Guys, please give a huge FU to Gary, owner of Alapurdi's restaurant in Clark, New Jersey. 
[00:07:30]  Can you tell him that I've always hated him, but now I can finally tell the world what  a jerk he is?  You bite, Gary.  That's from Lynn.  That's very nice, huh?  He's angry.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  Thanks.  Guess where I am.  Where?  56 and 7, handing out a bunch of flyers.  What do the flyers say?  It says, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah?  It says, check it out on the top.  It says, Opie and Anthony, a talk show that's fun. 
[00:08:00]  Give them a chance.  It's worth the last.  Monday through Friday, 3 to 7 p.m.  And you're handing these out in Midtown right now?  I'm right downstairs for you guys.  I'm on 56 and 7, man.  Right on!  I told you, I came through.  The moment of truth is here now, fellas.  All right, here's the deal.  As soon as you hand out all those flyers, we'll let you come on up and check out the show today.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm totally serious.  All right, man.  And the next batch you make up, you have to put Opie and Anthony and his brother, Joe.  Yeah, I know, because you got Joe up there today, right?  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, let's give you a party today, man.  I hear you, bro.  I want to be in on it.  Make sure you don't give those flyers to all the cab drivers, though.  Screw them.  No, I'm giving them to all the Chinese guys on scooters.  Wait, the river pool!  Or I get flyers, but I have to go.  I get every time I get my pool.  This is sick.  All right, man.  Call us back when you hand out all the flyers.  We got about 50 left.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, brother.  Later, fellas.  Here's someone doing the job.  That is so cool.  Yes.  He's part of phase two where he's spreading the word of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:09:00]  What the hell's going on down on the streets today?  There's sirens blaring behind him.  That's all the world leaders getting their shopping done before they head back to their country.  I like the fact that he brought up the scooter guys.  Yeah.  In Manhattan.  We saw a lot of scooter guys on the way in today.  That's the only way to get into Manhattan these days is on those little Vietnam-looking scooters  that they're driving around out on the streets.  It looks like downtown Hanoi in Midtown.  Oh, yo.  Get out of the way.  I'm very late for my delivery of Chang Wang's pork.  Oh, yo.  Get out of the way. 
[00:09:30]  Look out.  The pork gets cold.  Chang Fang pork.  Wait, no.  You ordered Chang Wang's pork.  Now you can return the Chang Fang pork, but you have to take Wa Chang pork.  Very nice.  But I'm happy that guy is spreading the word of the opening.  Yes.  We need that.  We totally need that.  And if you come up with a very good idea how to spread the word of the show, we'll listen  to you guys.  And we'll allow you to come in and hang out on the show.  So, yeah, like a guy like that with an airplane would be good. 
[00:10:00]  Leaflets.  Drop leaflets.  Just drop them.  Drop leaflets from the sky?  Yeah.  I like that.  I want a big banner in between the Twin Towers.  That'd work.  Why not?  That'd work.  Actually, everyone's got to rent Turk 182 this weekend.  So then you'll come up with some real good ideas for how to spread the word of the show.  You can't drive on the Queensborough Bridge.  You might as well hang a sign from it.  Yeah.  Why not?  Very nice.  1027 WNW, the rock of New York with the latest from the Goo Goo Dolls. 
[00:10:30]  That slide off their new CD, Dizzy Up the Girl.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  And it's Anthony's brother, Joe, warming up the guitar.  That would be me.  All right.  These guys are going to play a few ditties today on the show.  Yeah, we're going to do some of our wacky, goofy song parodies, Opie, that we've done  over the years.  Actually, we're getting a lot of requests for the goofy songs.  And if you want to send in a request for the song parodies that you've heard on our show,  you can do that today.  It's a parody of your choice.  A lot of people are calling in for the Frank Sinatra song that we did yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  We'll do that a little later in the show because that's an unbelievable song, actually.  Yeah.  And it's also FU Friday, so if you want to send an FU out to someone, give us a call.  Hi, Annie W.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to somebody.  Who?  This lady, Fran, in my office had nothing better to do today than to notice that I took  my high heels off for about five minutes, and she ran and told my boss, and he proceeded  to come in and yell at me instead of everybody for not having my shoes on.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:11:30]  I'd like for her to have a big, fat fuck you, Friday.  Your company has an unreasonable fear of feet.  You know what I'm saying?  What's the problem?  Like, why can't you have your feet showing?  I don't know.  My toenails are painted all different colors.  They look pretty cool.  It's not like they're all gross and stuff.  And your feet aren't stinky?  No, not stinky.  Huh.  Well, give her a big FU.  Say her name and let it fly.  Fuck you, Fran.  All right.  Have a great weekend.  Thanks.  There you go.  The concept of FU Friday. 
[00:12:00]  It's a very easy concept.  Someone has ticked you off this week, and we want to hear from you.  Normally, she just would have been able to say FU.  Right.  Right to the woman's face.  Yeah.  Now she can tell everybody.  I like that, actually.  For at least the 12 people listening.  Now, let me get this out of the way.  This will be the only one we do to the whore today.  All right?  Let's get it out of the way.  Please give a big FU to that slut, Monica Bluwinski, and that fat beast, Linda Tripp.  Okay.  Okay.  That's the only mention we give to that hooah.  We're trying to run Clinton free. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, we are trying, and we did pretty good yesterday.  We had one mention, and already we have a mention today.  It's hard not to talk about.  Quite a bit of energy over the past couple of weeks.  Yeah.  Yeah, but we've got to move on.  So, Joe's got his guitar.  He's ready, and you guys going to start up with a little warm-up here?  Yes, but before we get going, Opie, I'd just like to say, for all of your heating,  air conditioning, and sheet metal needs, it's true mechanical.  Oh, my God.  What a hack.  You're a hack.  Bohemia, New York.  I wouldn't even do that.  516-563-1950.  Oh, I wouldn't even do that. 
[00:13:00]  They're going to make you work harder now, you idiot.  I'm getting a raise, dude.  Oh, okay.  That's all I had to do.  All right.  Very good.  Oh, wow.  All right.  What a hack.  You hear that, Zippy?  Okay.  I wouldn't even have done that.  And I was as desperate as you are before I got into radio.  All right.  We're going to, yeah, I guess since Hurricane Georges is down there in the Caribbean.  Yeah.  Now it's in Florida.  Yeah.  But we're going to get like a little Caribbean feel.  Oh, very good.  It's a song you don't normally hear. 
[00:13:30]  Don Raga.  Isn't it pronounced Jorge Jorge?  Well, now they're just saying Hurricane Georges.  Georges.  I like the weatherman now.  They're coming out with the beret on and the little pencil mustache.  The Hurricane Georges is wreaking havoc on their keys.  La Crabble.  Oui, oui.  Yeah, this is a little ditty you don't normally hear done with a Raga feel.  Okay.  It's a story of a lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely girls, lovely girls. 
[00:14:00]  They were such lovely girls.  All of them had hair of black, just like their mamas, the youngest one in dreadlocks.  It's a story of a man named Radek, who was busy with three boys of his own.  Three boys, three boys. 
[00:14:30]  There were four men living all together.  Rata men.  And they all get stoned.  The Brady Blunts.  The Brady Blunts.  That's the way we became the Brady Blunts.  Yeah, man.  Bravo.  From Jamaica.  Just getting warmed up here on the Opie and Anthony show and Anthony's brother Joe today sitting in with us. 
[00:15:00]  Pass me a split, man.  All right.  We got more great tunes on the way as well.  Give me a blunt.  Shut up!  No more plugs, Joe, or we're kicking you out of here.  I will never again miss.  Plugging.  True mechanical.  Oh, please.  Shut the mic off.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  T-Rex on FU Friday.  Want to send one in?  You can do so through the fax line.  212-957-WNEW.  Or you can give us a quick ring at 212-757-1027.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony. 
[00:15:30]  It's Anthony's brother Joe.  Yeah.  And a stranger has entered the WNEW studios.  It's Mike from Elmont.  Hi, Mike.  This is Mike.  Been handing out flyers.  Well, I got to make sure he actually handed these out.  And if he didn't, then we're going to kick him out of the studio.  Call up, man.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Mike from Elmont is part of phase two of the Opie and Anthony campaign.  And that is to get, you know, listeners to this show.  New listeners.  There were some old NEW listeners.  Some of them didn't have open minds. 
[00:16:00]  We came on the air.  And they phased out.  Right.  They turned the radios off.  Yeah.  And left.  They couldn't understand humor.  I hope what we're doing is humor.  Well, whatever.  Whatever we do.  Yeah.  So phase two now is bringing in new listeners.  Yes.  And this gentleman here has allegedly handed out flyers.  Now, how many flyers did he hand out today, Mike?  I made up 300 and I brought four for you guys.  Four.  All right.  So where were you out there?  I was right on 56 and 7th, right across from the Red Eye.  Wasn't there a daycare center there or something? 
[00:16:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, it's the old age home.  Well, I'm scared to say this, but...  Those are some brand new listeners, Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm scared to say this, but if you got a flyer from Mike, I would appreciate it if you called  in.  That would confirm it.  So we could confirm that you actually got one of these flyers that Mike was handing  out on the streets today.  I want to know...  You crafty devil, you.  What does Mike do that he has time to hand out flyers for us all day?  I actually had to take the day off of work and I hope my boss isn't listening.  Oh!  All for the show, huh, Mike?  Actually, I drive old people around. 
[00:17:00]  You know, I transfer them to doctor's appointments and stuff like that.  Oh, and those like ambulance type of thing?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  So you see like the walker brigades and the...  Do you see the walker with wheels that me and Anthony talked about?  And the handbrakes.  And the handbrakes?  And how about the little rascal scooters?  You see a lot of those?  I see the headlight and the flashing light in the back.  Yeah.  I don't know if they're coming down the street.  Those are tricked out.  Right on.  Okay.  Well, Mike handed out flyers.  If you got one of these today, please give us a call because we want to confirm that  they actually hit the street, these flyers. 
[00:17:30]  And Mike, you know, you can plug the company you work with.  Oh, man.  I just turned Joe's mic off.  Mike.  There you go.  You're out.  Now you're out for the rest of the break.  You're out.  Because Mike was handing out flyers.  Some poor old guy's laying there.  I have bed shorts.  He was supposed to pick me up.  And the deal with Mike, I said if he handed out the flyers, he could come and hang out  on the show for a little while to check out what we do here, which is not much, actually.  Huh, Mike?  You noticed that already, right?  That's awesome.  I always wanted to see what it was on the other side of the room.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  Right on.  And if you come up with an idea to spread the word of the Opie and Anthony show, you  too could be sitting where Mike is.  Wow.  I know.  What a treat.  I know, but...  Nothing like being the first, though.  All right.  Hey, you want to sit in the chair that the skank hoe sat in completely naked?  No?  We have it over here in quarantine.  Actually, you're sitting in the chair that Mindy, the model from Big Butt Magazine, sat  in for four hours.  I think we have left over.  She fit on this seat here?  Barely, but you're sitting in that same exact seat right now, Mike.  Yeah, so...  All right.  It's an honor.  We'll go to the phones next, see if we can confirm that Mike actually handed out the 
[00:18:30]  flyers today for our show.  Cool.  And we got a lot to do.  Joe's here, Anthony's brother.  We're going to play some more Goop songs for you.  Yeah.  Put my mic back.  When he's not plugging things.  Well, we'll turn you up when you refuse to plug things.  I'll stop plugging.  Nope.  As soon as you plug, the mic goes off.  You're all invited here each week by Olsen Anthony to shout a hearty F.U.  at those Fs over here.  F.U.  Friday, that is.  Raise some hell. 
[00:19:00]  Blow the steam on.  Y'all come back now.  Yeah?  Wow.  That's right.  I like that.  Thank you.  F.U.  Friday.  You have that building up all week?  You're pissed?  Your boss wrong you?  Hmm?  Give us a call and let us know.  And Joe whipped that little theme song up.  I think we should send out a challenge to all the bands that listen to us to send in  their F.U.  Friday theme songs.  Yeah.  All right.  You could get a nice real polished one.  May I be on the judging panel?  Yeah, Joe, you could judge them, actually. 
[00:19:30]  You're listening to N.E.W., by the way.  Got a good fax here for F.U.  Friday.  Olsen Anthony, I need to send a big F.U.  to my wife for getting her period on my first day of vacation.  Oh!  No!  That balloons.  Oh!  Oh!  Red Tide.  Oh!  That's from J.D. in Edison, New Jersey.  J.D., I feel for you.  How long is vacation?  About a week.  Yeah!  Oh, that is the worst.  It all depends on how long you're married and where you're going, though.  That's true.  You know, if you're taking the kids to Disney, it doesn't really matter much. 
[00:20:00]  No.  If you're, you know, going up to that Mount Airy Lodge to sit in a champagne glass on your  first anniversary or something, then it might matter.  Hey, look, it's a Shirley Temple now.  What happened, honey?  All right.  Also in the studio today, Mike from Elmont, who supposedly passed out flyers on 56th and  7th.  We reward the people that help us.  It's, uh, we're like the mafia.  You do something for us, you do us a favor, we will return the favor. 
[00:20:30]  You come on up, Mikey.  We'll take good care of you.  We'll take care of you, Mikey.  I feel bad for you guys.  You guys are crying about not having listeners.  So, let me help him out, you know?  Well, I appreciate it.  He passed out flyers.  He passed out 300 flyers, but I'm convinced that he passed them out to blind people because  nobody's called in.  No one's called in.  If you've got a flyer that Mike handed out today on 56th and what, 7th you were at?  Right on the corner.  Right on the corner.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, he passed them out, and these are the guys.  Hey, thank you. 
[00:21:00]  Here's to make a nice pillow.  Here for my box.  Mommy, what does that say?  He passed them out, though.  That's all the count.  Who did you pass them out?  Did you pass them out to the guys that are selling the sunglasses out there?  Actually, I tried to pass them out to a bunch of chicks.  Did you?  Very nice.  There you go.  You're smart.  He was just using it to try to pick up girls.  Hoping that it sparks conversation.  Actually, I'm kind of, you know, an item with someone else right now.  Oh, are you?  Which is Christina.  Say hello to my husband.  Another guy plugging.  Everyone's plugging.  All right, now Mike. 
[00:21:30]  Turn his mic off now.  Mike has his mic off now.  I just got this fax from the gang at Town Square Deli in Chatham, New Jersey.  A big F you to this guy.  They faxed the news story.  Which one?  This is the story of the day.  Let me just read a little part of this.  The man called Long Branch Police to report that someone had stabbed him in the crotch as he slept.  But officers who responded quickly saw what had really happened.  The man had been having sex with a vacuum cleaner which severed part of his penis. 
[00:22:00]  Every guy out there is holding his crotch right now.  I remember reading that.  I remember reading that.  The 51-year-old man nearly died as a result of his injury Monday afternoon.  The man had expected the device's suction to provide him with some satisfaction.  But what he didn't realize is that there's a blade in the vacuum cleaner right under where the hose attaches.  Oh!  That pushes the dust into the collection bag.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my Lord.  Oh, so he was actually humping the machine, not the hose. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, where it chops up before it goes into the bag.  Oh!  Oh!  When he turned the vacuum on, the blade severed about a half inch, causing severe bleeding.  Wow.  I would think.  Oh, that would leave you with what?  Like a half inch.  Oh, you got me!  Oh, that's right!  I'm hung like an acorn, Anthony.  Oh, you got me!  Too quick for me!  The doctors were unable to reattach the, uh... 
[00:23:00]  I love that reaction.  I love that particular reaction to when Anthony nailed you or something.  You know that didn't change.  It didn't change from junior high.  I know.  Oh, my God.  All right.  More to do.  All right, man.  We got the Rolling Stones on the way, some REM, and a couple more goop songs from Anthony and  his brother, Joe.  Right.  Which one are you guys going to do in a little while?  I don't know.  We're going to do the morgue.  Okay.  The Frank Sinatra morgue song.  All right.  Maybe we'll just do, like, a couple of ditties from, uh, you know, the past, maybe.  Oh, I know. 
[00:23:30]  A little retrospective.  I should dredge some up.  Yeah, what?  I think you guys got...  I got a copy of the Cuban Refugee song.  Oh, we can't do that live.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York with the Rolling Stones.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  And, uh, now the WNEW Weekend Weather Check, sponsored by Hush Homebook.  All right.  We don't usually do weather.  They don't get it.  We don't do weather on our show.  All right.  Go do the weather, Anthony.  I'm going to go to the, uh, WNEW Weather Center.  Hold on.  All right.  He's going.  He's going. 
[00:24:00]  Take off my headphones.  He's going to the...  Hold on.  He's going to the window.  Hold on.  I got to open it.  Okay.  This is the weather.  Oh.  All right.  Be careful, Anthony.  Jesus.  It's kind of cloudy and overcast.  All right.  I see the sidewalk's a little wet.  It looked to be a little rain.  Hey, Joe.  Hold his legs.  He's going to fall out the window.  All right.  Well.  Easy.  Easy.  It's just a little breezy.  Not really that windy.  And I would say a high temperature. 
[00:24:30]  That's about 65 to 70.  Somewhere.  Okay.  Good.  Let me get back in here.  Let me swing around the corner.  All right.  All right.  He's back in.  I almost touched the skanko chair.  I know.  We've had it in the corner ever since she sat in it.  Her thing's crawling.  Yeah.  That is so funny because it has just sat there for the last week.  It's growing cultures.  We're making yogurt in the corner. 
[00:25:00]  And everyone is paranoid to touch the chair.  Okay.  So that was the weather.  This weekend, Rent Hush, a wicked suspense thriller starring Jessica Lange and Gwyneth Paltrow  from Columbia TriStar.  I've got to read it like that because I didn't see the movie.  Let me read some of that.  I can't.  I want to try reading one.  Next one.  Next one.  All right.  All right.  It is FU Friday, 212-757-1027 if you want in on the fun.  I've got a good fact here from Jessica from Rockville Center.  It says, Opie and Anthony, FU to all the New York Ranger fans for calling us nomads. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, I've been hearing this all week.  Oh, I'm an Islander fan, and it's tough times for us right now.  Islanders, we have no homeland.  White men, take away our home.  Put us on reservation in Lake Placid.  So they left the Coliseum because they say it's dangerous.  Well, the fact goes on.  The Islanders may not have a home, but they still have a dynasty.  Now, listen to me, Islanders.  I would stay in the Coliseum for this fact. 
[00:26:00]  They kind of play like crap, you know?  And to sell more tickets, if there's a chance to scoreboard my fall on the team, I'd go.  I would.  I think people are looking at me like, shut up.  There's Islander fans out there.  No, I don't.  I don't see things happening over there.  I'll be honest.  They say the scoreboard might fall.  Yeah.  I'll be honest.  I'm just depressed.  The team has stunk for many years.  A guy a few years ago tries to buy the team, and he didn't even have enough money in his bank account. 
[00:26:30]  That's shy stuff.  That was fun.  And now we don't have a place to play, but Gary Bettman was in town.  He's not satisfied that the place is strong enough to play.  See, I don't have a clue as to why don't they just fix it?  Replace the bolts.  Yeah.  New bolts on the scoreboard.  New bolts, and the scoreboard will stay up.  I think it's a little more than that.  Of course.  Well, I'm sure the story will come out soon.  They want a nice, big arena.  Yes, they do.  And they don't deserve it.  And they're using this fear tactic that it's not a safe place to try to get a better place. 
[00:27:00]  Very intelligent conversation, Ant.  Thank you, Opie.  You might be on to something, though.  Correspondent Anthony on the scene in Nassau County.  Okay, everyone's requesting the Morgue song by Anthony and his brother Joe.  That's why Joe is in here.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Pearl Jam from Yield Wish List.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And Anthony's brother Joe sitting in on the show today.  We're going to do a little retrospective of some of our little song parodies that we've done. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Opie.  Because if anybody doesn't know, that's how me and Opie hooked up in the radio biz.  That's right.  Yeah, I was working on Long Island doing a night show.  I came banging on a door one night.  Yeah, you did.  Actually, Joe hooked me and Anthony up.  Yeah, that's true.  Joe stopped by with this unbelievable song that Anthony and Joe did.  The O.J. song.  The O.J. song.  Yeah.  When the O.J. thing was hot.  When O.J. was as hot as Clinton is now, I asked all the local bands on Long Island to come up with song parodies. 
[00:28:00]  I think O.J. was even hotter than Clinton is now.  Yeah.  All Clinton did was splooge and, well, you know, we all know it.  O.J. made a bigger mess over a lot more clothing.  That's right.  That's true.  That's true.  So, you know, I encouraged all the bands to come up with wacky songs about the O.J. trial.  And Anthony and his brother came up with the best one by far.  And that's how me and Anthony hooked up.  Then we started doing radio together.  Yeah.  What was that, like five years ago now? 
[00:28:30]  That's right, you bandwrecker.  Yeah.  That's right.  Actually, I broke up the band.  Broke up the band.  You were the Yoko Ono of Rotgut.  That's right.  I hope he was.  But since then, one of the things that me and Anthony have had on our show is a lot of these song parodies and goop songs.  And just about all of them are produced by, you know, Anthony and his brother Joe.  Yeah.  We don't need a service to do that.  No.  Honestly, a lot of radio stations in town, you know, they get services and stuff. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  To give them their good songs.  But...  We like doing them ourselves.  Exactly.  I mean, like Red Peter's How's Your Whole Family, you know, of course.  But at least we give credit where credit is due.  Exactly.  A lot of these songs have been played in the New York area before me and Anthony came back home.  And...  Yeah.  Well, now we're back and now they can't play those songs anymore and make believe it was there.  So...  Now, this little ditty.  Unfortunately, we were between jobs when we wrote this one.  Wrote it about a year ago. 
[00:29:30]  Waiting for Frank Sinatra to die to play it.  Yeah.  Me and Anthony were sitting on this song for, what?  About a year?  About a year.  Because it looked like Frank had these false alarms every couple of months where he'd be...  Yeah.  Ready to die.  When we sat down.  When we sat down to write this, he was on...  He was on his deathbed.  Death's door, baby.  We figured we'd get it within like a week.  Yeah.  We figured we'd get it on the end.  And he hung on until...  Me and Opie got the boot from Boston.  We got fired and then, to add insult to injury, then Frank Sinatra died.  He has the nerve to drop dead while we're in between jobs. 
[00:30:00]  But that doesn't stop us.  We'll do it anyway.  So, yeah, let's do the Frank Sinatra song.  This is a little ditty for Frank.  This is a little ditty for Frank Sinatra song. 
[00:30:30]  I've got a tag around my toe.  The morgue, the morgue.  And soon they'll put me in a hole that's six feet deep.  My blue eyes shut very tight in eternal sleep. 
[00:31:00]  I have passed away wearing my toupee.  I've got a death certificate.  The morgue, the morgue.  And please pardon me, cause they're, yeah, they're embalming me. 
[00:31:30]  Old blue eyes in the morgue.  The morgue.  The morgue.  Old blue eyes, chairman of the morgue, baby.  Woo!  Thank you.  Oh, I think people are driving off the road right now.  Oh, poor Frank.  We had to die when we were off the air, so we have to do it now. 
[00:32:00]  What do you mean, man?  This is back with me.  And if you think that song is tasteless, stick around for the Cuban refugee song.  Don't conk, conk, conk, chonk.  Also, there's some 12-year-old kid on the line that, um, he made a song parody about, uh, Bill and Monica, and he wants to see what you guys think of it.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  The latest from Kenny Wayne Shepherd on FU Friday.  That's somehow, somewhere, someway.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Anthony's brother Joe hanging with us today.  And, uh, we got, uh, something on the phone lines. 
[00:32:30]  You never know what you're going to hear when you're tuning us in.  That's for sure, right?  Well, we got a 12-year-old kid that has a song parody about, uh, Bill and Monica.  All right, now, we're not doing many song parodies about Bill and Monica today.  No.  Or talking about them.  Yeah.  Yeah, he gets sick of it.  Well, he's 12.  It scares me that a 12-year-old kid would even attempt to make a song parody out of the Bill and Monica mess, so.  I gotta hear it.  You wanna give this kid a chance?  I don't even think I'd try to tackle that one.  Hey, kid, let's hear your song. 
[00:33:00]  Okay, here it is.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lion and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's capers and she calls him a hushy-loving man.  And she'd like to have a little explanation about what I heard during the latest conversation.  I will say without the moment of hesitation, a mama didn't want to shout, Bill, get out, get out. 
[00:33:30]  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lion and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  His Christian values have gone to hell these days.  Now, he's a God-faring, hushy-loving man.  If he'd like to have a little explanation about what I heard during the latest conversation.  I will say without the moment of hesitation, a mama didn't want to shout, Bill, get out, get out. 
[00:34:00]  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lion and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's capers and she calls him a hushy-loving man.  What's your name?  My name is Skidmark.  Skidmark.  And I'm 12 years old. 
[00:34:30]  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, yeah, you'll be hearing from me more.  All right, Skidmark.  Cool.  Very good.  Thanks.  There you go, Skidmark, the 12-year-old kid.  Skidmark's got to get off the helium.  That was pretty good.  Skidmark, alias Alfalfa Schweitzer.  Yeah, that's Alfalfa.  That's what it was.  It sounded like from the Little Rascals.  Yeah.  Alfalfa.  Friends, Romans, and countrymen. 
[00:35:00]  Hey, we're spanking.  Know when Alfalfa used to sing all those songs?  Yeah.  I'm the viber of the field.  Mama keeps on crying.  It sounded like the Little Rascals.  Get a hold of Hal Roach.  Have him sign that kid up.  We should ask Skidmark if he had personality.  He's got his little hair poking up.  Skidmark, you have personality?  Skidmark can't come to school today.  Mother, cut off her finger. 
[00:35:30]  Skidmark can't come to school today.  Mama shot Papa.  Hey, Skidmark, can I have your pocket knife if you get killed?  I just got to hear, like, just a tiny bit more of this.  Okay, here it is.  Mama keeps crying all about my daddy.  Lying and the way he cheated on her with.  That could shatter glass.  It's catchy, though, isn't it?  Oh, it's catchy.  It could be in my head all night. 
[00:36:00]  I'll remember that song.  Oh, very good, Skidmark.  Call back with any parodies you might have in your brain, right?  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy.  Lying and the way he cheated on her with.  Mama, Dad.  Mama.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy.  Mama reads the papers.  She calls him a hushy-loving man.  A hushy-loving man.  Skidmark is the king of the show today, without a doubt.  No one's going to top that one today.  I'll tell you one thing.  Whether you like it or not, you're going to be hearing that at 2 in the morning if you wake up. 
[00:36:30]  It's just going to get it out of my head.  Why did I have to look dopey and antsy today?  All right.  Thank you, Skidmark.  Sheryl Crowe, my favorite mistake on the Rock of New York, 102.7 WNEW.  It's dope.  It's Ant.  It's Ant's Brothers Joe.  Ant's Brothers Joe.  Ant's Brother Joe.  Yes, okay.  Ant's Brother Joe.  Hey, we've got to do the weather again, Ant.  We do?  Already?  And now the WNEW Weekend Weather Check, sponsored by Hush Home Video.  Oh, should I pull up the WNEW Doppler 5000? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, why don't you do that?  It's 1,000 better than the Doppler 4000.  Okay.  That they have.  Well, we've got to give some type of forecast here, so why don't you give it to us, Ant?  Okay.  As I look at the Doppler 5000, which is out our window, actually.  Okay.  It looks kind of cooler than it has been lately.  All right.  I'm saying about, what, 65 degrees?  Sounds good.  It's a little hazy, overcast, damp.  All right.  It's been a little drizzle.  Yeah.  I would say gradual darkening toward evening. 
[00:37:30]  Darkening of the sky toward evening, yes.  Okay, very good.  That's enough.  This weekend, Red Hush, a wicked suspense thriller starring Jessica Lange and Gwyneth Paltrow from Columbia TriStar.  There you go.  All right?  All right, Mom.  Well, I don't know.  I think it's time to play the Cuban Drown Thought.  Ah, yes.  When was this one originally?  This one was originally for the flotilla, right?  Yeah, they had the...  Both people?  Yeah, both people.  They were coming over on everything.  Scraps of wood.  And we were pissed. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Scraps of wood.  Whatever.  Pizza boxes.  Pick up out of the garbage.  And float over.  So you guys came up with a song.  A little ditty.  And our guitar player in this is actually a Cuban.  Cuban, dude.  And he had to sit through us doing this.  Rexie.  All right, so...  All right, it's a song about Cubans finding stuff to float to America on.  He helped.  He helped on the vocals.  Yeah.  He was in there doing this.  So this is the disclaimer.  So when we get all the Cubans in there, we'll be okay?  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Tell your complaints to Rex.  He's Cuban.  That's right.  All right, well, this is...  That makes me want to do the swing.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  I kind of forgot how that song went.  Oh, I can smell the complaint letters coming in.  I guess shove a motor up her ass, use her as a bug.  Oh, what's that?  I guess my chances of running for any political officer pretty well next time after that one. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, man.  Well, that's a great little song you guys came up with.  That's great.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's Rotgut in the Cuban Drown song.  I have no idea who did that song.  But Rex, your guitar player, is Cuban.  Yeah, he's Cuban.  He wrote the whole thing.  He did.  Oh, okay.  It's all on him.  It's in his biography.  It's a true story.  That's right.  Actually, he co-wrote it with Fidel Castro.  Yeah.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York. 
[00:39:30]  We've got to teach Joe radio etiquette there.  With the little lights on.  With the little lights on.  Don't talk and definitely don't curse.  On the air.  See, then you don't talk until...  That's why I was pointing to that, because when I was talking,  the light wasn't on.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I'm not going to acknowledge Joe this break.  I'm serious.  All right.  All right.  Jesus.  All right.  I have to deal with it so many years of my life.  Say hi to the people at www.mybosssucks.com. 
[00:40:00]  They put a little banner up on their site featuring us.  Really?  Yes, they did.  They said, we just created a banner ad and placed it on a webpage.  Check it out.  It's at mybosssucks.com.  Now, are they part of Phase 2 and the Opie and Anthony program to get more listeners?  Yes.  I think they like us.  They said, Howard blew us off a year ago, the dick.  We'd love to come over and talk about doing something on the site about you guys and your bosses.  Thanks, James.  Thanks, James.  We appreciate that.  Yes.  Yes, we do.  By the way, Mike is still hanging out in the studio. 
[00:40:30]  Mike from Illinois.  Oh, yeah.  It's awesome.  It's awesome.  You having a good time, Mike?  Yeah, man.  I really know what it's like from on the other side.  All right.  See what goes on.  Whatever you want.  Now, tell the listeners that we're actually nice guys when we're, you know, not talking on the air and stuff.  I'm going to lie.  All right.  They're real cool guys, man.  They're making me feel comfortable, you know.  And it's, you know.  All right.  The reason Mike is in here, because he decided to take Phase 2 into his hands.  And he passed out 300 flyers today all over Midtown that said, check it out. 
[00:41:00]  Opie and Anthony, a talk show that's fun.  Give them a chance.  It's worth the laugh.  Monday through Friday, 3 to 7 on 1027 WNEW-FM.  Problem is, not one person called that got the flyers today.  Jeez.  Now, do we believe he really did that?  Yeah.  I'm responsible for the effort, not the outcome.  All right.  Well, you made the effort, and we appreciate that.  That's right.  We're looking for other people to come up with creative ways on how to spread the word of the show here.  Get more in our flip-mo squad.  We need more homes in our flip-mo squad. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we do need that.  Hey, I want to do a tune, man.  You want to do another song?  Yeah, it's a quickie.  Is it as brutal as the Cuban song we just heard a little while ago?  It might be.  I don't know.  All right.  What is this one about?  Well, this one on, we wrote this one a while ago when, who was it?  David Crosby.  David Crosby was getting his liver transplanted.  Getting his liver.  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  Okay, great.  All right. 
[00:42:00]  You, who's a bloated load that had to go for a liver transplant.  Drink, drink like a fish.  Your bile duct has turned to cement.  It's dense, it's black and blue and gray.  Turn your liver to pate. 
[00:42:30]  A useless lump of clay.  You've got cirrhosis.  It's a fun little ditty, right?  About cirrhosis of the liver, Opie?  Yeah, that's right.  That's a cute number.  What a mess we got going on today.  It's fun, right?  Yes, it is.  Sure it is.  Hey, don't forget, Monday morning during the Dave Herman Rock and Roll Morning Show, we 
[00:43:00]  will auction off field box seat tickets to the first two Yankee playoff games.  Wow.  That's cool.  All proceeds go to the Children's Health Fund.  Games are Tuesday and Wednesday.  All right.  So make sure you listen to Dave Herman Monday.  All right.  Hey, speaking of baseball, real fast, did you see the clip of Ted Kennedy on the news last  night?  What a moron.  He was talking about the home run race with Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa, and he called  Mark McGuire Mike.  So he goes, I want to congratulate Mike McGuire.  Mike McGuire.  And Sammy Sassa. 
[00:43:30]  Sammy Sassa and Mike McGuire.  Sammy Sassy.  Two fine football players.  Is this guy lost?  What a boy.  What a bloated mess.  What does Ted Kennedy have that Bill Clinton wishes he had?  A dead girlfriend.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Marcy Playground, Sex and Candy.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Let me try that.  And Anthony's on the job.  The Rock of New York, WNEW, it's Marcy Playground, Sex and Candy.  Wow, look at him. 
[00:44:00]  That's great.  He's trying out for your job, Opie.  Thank you.  Did you actually have to live with this guy for how many years?  Many years.  He's out of your house?  Many years.  Many years.  And this wasn't anything, because quite frankly, I had a hard time to do it.  Hard time in Elwood Junior High, because he had the distinction of being the first guy  ever caught with pot in Elwood Junior High.  I got busted, dude.  He did.  I got busted.  It was such a dopey story, too.  Mr. Geig.  Mr. Geig.  Mr. Geig.  Remember, he ran out onto the playground.  I was sitting out there with all my friends shelling off my nickel bag. 
[00:44:30]  And Mr. Geig ran out and snatched it from my hands, but not before I could eat the contents  of the bag.  So I had all kinds of green stuff swimming around my teeth, and Mr. Geig asked me, what's  that in your mouth?  I said, it's oregano for my pizza pie, because it was right outside the lunchroom.  Oh, man.  It was on my toes, man.  Thank you.  Elwood Junior High.  Wait, Anthony, you've got to tell the pot story. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, because I was a goody two-shoes.  Anthony played with microscopes, and Joe played with bongs, and Joe was smoking weed and stuff.  And I remember the teachers all after this happened, because it was a huge deal.  Like, oh, my God, pot in Elwood Junior High.  Suburbia.  Anthony made a microscope out of a bong.  Yeah.  So the teachers were coming up to me and saying, taking me aside, you know, is there anything  you need, any help?  Like, they thought I was going to automatically become this big pothead because of Joe. 
[00:45:30]  But I had many years of being a nerd.  I went home one day.  We went across the street in the woods from our house.  It was a lot.  Yeah, a little lot.  And I find pot plants.  And I'm talking, oh, I'm talking about Kona bud that had been, that had been, like, cared  for and nurtured for months and months and months.  It was getting close to harvest time.  But the Suffolk County Police Department came to the school, like, a week before and showed 
[00:46:00]  us what pot looked like.  So I'm walking through the woods, and I see pot, and I'm like, oh, it's pot.  This is marijuana.  Okay, now, you have to remember that this pot was not mine.  It wasn't Anthony's.  It was the big kids that lived next door.  And I'm talking about guys that had been in and out of the joint, bikers.  There were all kinds of, like, really nasty dudes living next door.  Go on, Anthony.  So I uproot the plant.  Oh!  Oh, no!  I grab, take them home. 
[00:46:30]  Now, in the meantime, I'm in the kitchen, stoned to the bejesus belt.  I'm sitting down at the kitchen table, sucking on a bowl of Froot Loops or something, and  Anthony comes walking through the door.  My mom is washing the dishes.  Anthony comes walking through the door with two lovely bouquets of nearly mature Kona bud.  Look, Mom!  Marijuana!  Yeah, like, I'm going to, like, affect the drugs that are killing our country.  The spoon fell from my mouth with several Froot Loops. 
[00:47:00]  He knew where they came from.  My mother turned around.  She looked at it.  She goes, take it out in the back and crush it up.  So there I was in the backyard on the cement patio, grinding every single leaf into oblivion.  Just grinding it with my shoe as Joe looked on like one of those...  In horror.  One of those dogs with the big eyes and the velvet paintings.  Absolutely.  Out the window.  He's just looking like, no, no.  And then, like, a half hour later, I looked out of the backyard, and I just see him on 
[00:47:30]  his knees trying to find anything, a stem, anything.  Picking up seeds.  Picking up his stem.  And somebody got the living crap kicked out of him because, obviously, they were accused  of stealing the plants.  Well, no.  What happened was the big guys came to me.  Where's our pot, Joe?  Where did our plants go, Joe?  Joe, uh...  My brother took him.  Kill him.  No, no, no.  I covered your ass.  Thank you, Joe.  I said, I said, I was... 
[00:48:00]  I was...  In his honest voice as I could muster, I said, Ralph Fascianelli.  Who was Ralph?  He took it.  He's some guy that...  He's since died.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  That was a direct result of that.  All right.  Paper trails ended.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  Loose ends, though.  You'll never get caught.  That's a good pot story.  Your whole family was a mess, though.  What about your uncle?  My uncle, Joe, had pot plants that were...  They were like redwood trees. 
[00:48:30]  From the second story bathroom, we lived in a cape, and from the second story bathroom,  you could see the buds peeking up from, like, the window sill.  It was in East Islip, and we had a cop living next door.  Yeah.  A police sergeant living next door.  My uncle, who is my mother's brother, had my mother bamboozled into thinking,  No, Ro, it's a basil-oregano hybrid I'm developing, like he's working for the Department of Agriculture.  And there I was, spreading it on the pizza pie and throwing it in the family's sundae sauce. 
[00:49:00]  But they were huge.  And my father showed up.  Yeah, he didn't live with you back then.  No, no, no.  Horrible story of divorce and heartbreak for the children.  But he shows up, and he's like, What the hell?  They're 10 feet tall pot plants doing in the backyard.  We're talking 20 of them.  There had to be 20 of them.  Like, what are you doing?  They're going to take the kids away if police find you with plants in the backyard.  And the police are living next door at this point.  And my mother, misknowledgeable about everything.  Oh, Joe, you stupid ass. 
[00:49:30]  It's basil-oregano hybrid.  Don't you know anything?  Basil-oregano.  Let me call the cops and tell them about this basil-oregano hybrid.  There were a whole lot of people coming in to see Uncle Joe about copping some of that basil-oregano hybrid.  Walking out with a huge plastic bag.  I never understood why people would trade perfectly good Fender Stratocaster guitars and Marshall amps for basil-oregano.  Something you could get for nothing at the supermarket.  But for some reason, they were very interested in Uncle Joe's basil-oregano. 
[00:50:00]  Maybe they were just shopping for Bertucci's or something.  Yeah.  A lot of it.  Uncle Joe had the best basil-oregano.  Oh, that's classic.  A lot of pot.  All right, stick around.  On the way, we've got the latest from Hole and Led Zeppelin next.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  As you cruise around town, that's Hole Celebrity Skin.  Title track from Courtney Love's new CD.  Joe was jamming to that, huh?  Rock.  The acoustic version without the boobs. 
[00:50:30]  All right, don't try to sing it, though.  I'm not going to.  We're just about out of here, I guess, huh?  Yeah, we just got one more little ditty for, you know, the ladies.  All right, well, let me thank everyone before we leave people with this song, okay?  We've got to thank Rick for producing the show today.  Of course.  We've got to thank Mike for stopping by from Elmont.  Have you had a good time, Mike?  I've had a ball, fellas.  Thanks a lot.  The only reason Mike was in the studio is because he's helping spread the word about the Opie  and Anthony show.  We didn't know him from a hole in the wall until he started passing out flyers about our show. 
[00:51:00]  So, Michael, nobody called.  They got the flyers.  The next time, we'll just have to make a thousand of them.  Oh, thank you very much.  There you go.  And a little challenge to the rest of the faithful listeners out there.  If you come up with a very creative way to spread the word about the Opie and Anthony show,  you, too, could sit where Mike is sitting.  And watch the operation.  Watch where the tragic happens.  Yeah, exactly.  And Mike didn't have to sit in the skank whore chair, so.  No, we have that firmly entrenched in the back of the console.  There are things crawling on that chair.  It is.  Yes, we also got to thank Joe, Anthony's brother, for stopping by. 
[00:51:30]  You guys never have to thank me.  I know.  We're all hanging out for the next few hours.  Yeah, we're going to hang out.  All right.  And Matt Devote is up next.  We'll see you guys on the radio Monday at 3, and go Mets, go.  Anthony and Joe will end the show.  This is for the ladies.  You know, what all us guys like for the weekend.  All right.  Here we go.  One, two, three.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us.  Give us a Lewinsky. 
[00:52:00]  Give us.  Last night you fell asleep.  But I want to sink it deep.  It feels so cool when you start to drool.  But please just watch the teeth.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us a Lewinsky. 
[00:52:30]  Give us a Lewinsky. </pre>
