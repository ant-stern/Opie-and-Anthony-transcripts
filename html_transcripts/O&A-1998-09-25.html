<pre> 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York with Lonesome George Thurow.  Good afternoon, it's FU Friday.  FU.  Made it through another week here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey man, how you doing?  Pretty good.  We got a little guest in the studio today.  A little guest?  It's not a guest, he's my brother Joe.  Not little.  It's my brother Joe, he's not a guest.  He's a guest.  It's brother Joe.  He's the music behind all the wacky song parodies here.  I think he's the official music director of the Opie and Anthony show.  We don't have much of a budget on the show, but Joe is the music director. 
[00:30]
 He's the head of the Opie and Anthony orchestra which consists of him.  I'll do it for 10 bucks a week.  We'll give you a case of beer a week to be the music director.  You can sleep right here in the studio.  That's a bet.  Yeah, that's good.  I'll take it.  But Joe stopped by with his guitar and we're going to sing some ditties today.  We're going to do some wacky tunes.  Just a lot of the faithful listeners enjoy all the song parodies that we've had on the  show.  Between Joe and Anthony, they've pretty much done most of them.  Yes, thank you. 
[01:00]
 If you want to request one of the goofy songs you've heard on our show, you can do that  today.  It's FU Friday.  Yes.  It's your time to event.  You've been in hell all week.  There's traffic this week.  I want to send a big FU out to the world leaders.  Can you guys go home?  We don't want you in our city anymore.  Why do the United Nations have to be here?  It's not like they walk here.  They all have to fly in.  Put it somewhere in the Midwest where nobody's working and has to conduct business.  I don't mind that the UN is in New York City. 
[01:30]
 I mind that these leaders go from the UN uptown to where we're at to go shopping.  Because we're not working or anything, right?  Let's close down three or four blocks because Haji needs a South Park t-shirt to bring home  with him.  I got the boomy's.  Meanwhile, they have to shut 10 streets around where they're shopping so no bombs go off,  I guess, or whatever.  Do you know the overtime these cops have got to be getting?  I know.  They're not catching any of the crack dealers this week because they're too busy on the 
[02:00]
 corner around 57th, 56th Street escorting a world leader around.  Great.  Thank you.  Joe, do you have any FUs to start the show today?  No, no FUs at all.  Not this week.  Wow, you've had a good week.  You had a good week. 
[02:30]

[03:00]
 I hope you're still knocking tin.  I was knocking tin four years ago.  I have an FU.  He's FU to my brother, Anthony.  Yeah, most of you guys used to knock tin and now Anthony has a smooth operator on the radio. 
[03:30]
 We're trying to get Joe out of that.  Yeah, we'll get Joe out of that.  If any band needs a guitar.  Thank you.  I need that.  I'll stay in tin.  Thank you.  Joe's up to two FUs today.  I hope he's on the list.  All right.  I was going to play the pipe song here, but we'll tease that.  We'll play that next.  Okay?  One of the songs that Joe came up with.  Hi, N.A.W.  Yeah, I'd like to make a dedication to the pipe song.  All right.  My dad's getting it today.  Your dad's getting the pipe?  As we speak.  Why?  What's the matter with him? 
[04:00]
 No, it's that time and he has to go get the pipe.  How old is he?  51.  Wasn't this cool?  I have no idea.  All I know is he ain't looking forward to it.  What's your dad's name?  Robert.  Robert.  Robert.  Robert.  This one's for you.  That's what I want.  Good luck with the pipe!  Well, if you turn 53 and you find it hard to breathe, you need the pipe.  You're having trouble with erection, gotta shove it up your record, it's the pipe.  Or if your prostate is born with an autophotographic hole, it's the pipe.  Let's go!  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Where you going?  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.

 Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  It's big, big and mean, there's a lot of Vaseline with the pipe.  And you'll know when it's strong, you'll just feel your bums part with the pipe.  You'll be bopped and like Robo when the doctor bends you open with the pipe.  Hey, let's go!  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.  Let's go get the pipe.

They're just nice about it actually.  They spray something afterwards.  We got hundreds of...  All right let's try this one real fast from Lynn.  Guys please give a huge FU to Gary owner of Al Aperti's restaurant in Clark New Jersey. 
[07:30]
 Can you tell him that I've always hated him but now I can finally tell the world what  a jerk he is.  You bite Gary.  That's from one of our...  That's very nice huh?  He's angry.  Hi N.A.W.  Hey Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  What's up fellas?  Thanks.  Guess where I am?  Where?  56 to 7 handing out a bunch of flyers.  What do the flyers say?  It says uh Opie and Anthony.  Yeah?  First it says check it out on the top.  It says Opie and Anthony a talk show that's fun.  Give them a chance it's worth the laugh.  Monday through Friday 3 to 7 pm on 127 WNDW. 
[08:00]
 And you're handing these out in midtown right now?  Yeah.  I'm right downstairs for you guys.  I'm on 56 to 7 man.  Right on.  I told you I came through.  The moment of truth is here now fellas.  Alright here's the deal.  As soon as you hand out all those flyers we'll let you come on up and check out the show  today.  Yeah?  Yeah I'm totally serious.  Alright man uh.  The next batch you make up you have to put Opie Anthony and his brother Joe.  Yeah I know because you got Joe up there today right?  Yeah.  Yeah let's give you a party today man.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that. 
[08:30]
 Alright man call us back when you hand out all the flyers.  Alright.  Alright.  Thank you brother.  Alright.  Here's someone doing the job.  That is so cool.  Yes.  He's part of phase two where he's spreading the word of Opie Anthony.  Yeah.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.

Yes, we need that. We totally need that. If you come up with a very good idea how to spread  the word to the show, we'll listen to you guys and we'll allow you to come in and hang  out on the show.  Yes, a guy like that with an airplane would be good. 
[10:00]
 Leaflets from the sky.  Drop leaflets from the sky?  Yes.  I like that. I want a big banner in between the Twin Towers.  That'd work.  Why not?  Sure.  Actually, everyone's got to rent Turk 182 this weekend. Then you'll come up with some  real good ideas for how to spread the word of the show.  You can't drive on the Queensboro Bridge. You might as well hang a sign from it.  Why not?  Very nice.  1027 WNNW, the Rock of New York with the latest from the Goo Goo Dolls. That slide off there. 
[10:30]
 New CD Dizzy Up the Girl. It's Opie. It's Anthony. It's Anthony's brother Joe warming  up the guitar.  That would be me.  All right. These guys are going to play a few ditties today on the show.  We're going to do some of our wacky, goofy song parodies, Opie, that we've done over  the years.  Actually, we're getting a lot of requests for the goofy songs. If you want to send in  a request for the song parodies that you've heard on our show, you can do that today.  Song parody of your choice.  A lot of people are calling in for the Frank Sinatra song that we did yesterday. We'll 
[11:00]
 do that a little later in the show because that's an unbelievable song, actually. It's  also FU Friday. If you want to send an FU out to someone, give us a call.  Hi, NW.  I'd like to give a big f**k you to somebody.  Who?  This lady Fran in my office had nothing better to do today than to notice that I took my  high heels off for about five minutes and she ran and told my boss and he proceeded  to come in and yell at me instead of everybody for not having my shoes on.  Are you kidding me? 
[11:30]
 I'd like for her to have a big fat f**k you Friday.  Your company has an unreasonable fear of feet.  You know what I'm saying?  What's the problem? Why can't you have your feet showered?  I don't know. My toenails are painted all different colors. They look pretty cool. It's  not like they're all gross and stuff.  And your feet aren't stinky?  No, not stinky.  Well, give her a big FU. Say her name and let it fly.  F**k you, Fran.  Alright, have a great weekend. There you go. The concept of FU Friday. It's a very easy 
[12:00]
 concept. Someone has ticked you off this week and we want to hear from you. Normally, she  just would have been able to say FU right to the woman's face. Now she can tell everybody.  I like that, actually.  Or at least the 12 people listening.  Now let me get this out of the way. This will be the only one we do to the whore today.  Let's get it out of the way. Please give a big FU to that slut Monica Bluinski and that  fat beast Linda Tripp. That's the only mention we give to that ooo-ah.  We're trying to run Clinton free. 
[12:30]
 We are trying and we did pretty good yesterday. We had one mention and already we have a mention  today. It's hard not to talk about them.  We've supplied quite a bit of energy over the past couple of weeks.  Yeah, but we've got to move on.  So Joe's got his guitar. He's ready. You guys going to start up with a little warm-up here?  Yes, but before we get going, Opie, I'd just like to say for all of your heating, air conditioning  and sheet metal needs, it's true mechanical.  Oh my God, what a hack. You're a hack.  Bohemia, New York.  I wouldn't even do that.  I wouldn't even do that.  I wouldn't even do that.  They're going to make you work harder now, you idiot. 
[13:00]
 I'm getting a raise, dude.  Oh, okay.  That's all I had to do.  All right, very good.  Wow.  All right.  What a hack.  Can you hear that zippy?  Okay.  I wouldn't even have done that. I was as desperate as you are before I got into radio.  All right, we're going to... Yeah, I guess since Hurricane George, George's is down there  in the Caribbean.  Yeah.  Now it's in Florida.  Yeah.  But we're going to get like a Caribbean feel.  Oh, very good.  It's a song you don't normally hear. It's done at Raaga. 
[13:30]
 Isn't it pronounced?  Jorge?  Jorge.  Well, now they're just saying Hurricane George.  George.  I like the weatherman now.  They're coming out with the beret on and the little pencil mustache.  The Hurricane George is leaking havoc on the keys.  Yeah, this is a little ditty you don't normally hear done with a Raaga feel.  Okay.  It's a story of a lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely girls. 
[14:00]
 Lovely girls.  They were such lovely girls.  All of them had hair of black just like their mamas, the youngest one in dreadlocks.  It's a story of a man named Brady who was busy with three boys of his own.  Three boys, three boys. 
[14:30]
 They were four men living all together, Rasta men.  And they all get stoned.  The Brady Blondes.  The Brady Blondes.  The Brady Blondes.  That's the way we became the Brady Blondes.  Yeah, man.  Bravo.  From Jamaica.  Just getting warmed up here on the Opian Anthony Show and Anthony's brother Joe today sitting 
[15:00]
 with us.  Pass me a spleep, man.  All right, we got more great tunes on the way as well.  Give me a blonde.  Shut up!  No more plugs, Joe, or we're kicking you out of here.  I will never again miss plugging.  True mechanical.  Please shut the mic off.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York T-Rex on FU Friday.  Want to send one in?  You can do so through the fax line 212-957-WNEW or you can give us a quick ring at 212-757-1027.  It's Opian Anthony and it's Anthony's brother Joe. 
[15:30]
 And a stranger has entered the WNEW studios.  It's Mike from Elmont.  Hi, Mike.  This is Mike.  I've been handing out flyers.  Well, I've got to make sure he actually handed these out and if he didn't then we're going  to kick him out of the studio.  All right, here's the deal.  Mike from Elmont is part of phase two of the Opian Anthony campaign and that is to get  listeners to the show.  New listeners.  There were some old N.E.W. listeners.  Some of them didn't have open minds. 
[16:00]
 We came on the air and they phased out.  They turned the radios off.  They left.  They couldn't understand humor.  I hope what we're doing is humor.  Whatever.  Whatever we do.  So phase two now is bringing in new listeners.  Yes.  And this gentleman here has allegedly handed out flyers.  Now how many flyers did you hand out today, Mike?  I made up 300 and I brought four for you guys.  Four.  All right.  So where were you out there?  I was right on 56 and 7, right across from the red eye.  Wasn't there a daycare center there or something? 
[16:30]
 Oh, no.  The old age home.  Well, I'm scared to say this but...  Those are some brand new listeners, I hope.  Yeah.  I'm scared to say this but if you got a flyer from Mike, I would appreciate it if you called  in.  That would confirm it.  So we could confirm that you actually got one of these flyers that Mike was handing  out on the streets today.  I want to know...  You crafty devil, you.  What does Mike do that he has time to hand out flyers for us all next?  I actually have to take the day off of work and I hope my boss isn't listening.  All for the show, huh, Mike?  Actually, I drive old people around. 
[17:00]
 I transfer them to doctor's appointments and stuff like that.  Oh, and those like ambulance type things?  Oh, no.  So you see like the walker brigades and the...  Do you see the walker with wheels that me and Anthony talked about?  And the handbrakes?  And the handbrakes?  And how about the little rachical scooters?  You see a lot of those?  I see the headlight and the flash light in the back.  They're coming down the street.  Those are tricked down.  Right on.  Okay.  Well, Mike handed out flyers.  If you got one of these today, please give us a call because we want to confirm that  they actually hit the street, these flyers. 
[17:30]
 And Mike, you know you can plug the company.  You work for them.  Hey, no.  I just turned Joe's mic off.  Mike.  There you go.  You're out.  Now you're out for the rest of the break.  You're out.  Because Mike was handing out flyers.  Some poor old guys laying there.  I have bedshorts.  Who is supposed to pick me up?  And the deal with Mike, I said if he handed out the flyers, he could come and hang out  on the show for a little while to check out what we do here, which is not much actually,  huh, Mike?  You noticed that already, right?  I always wanted to see what it was on the other side of the room. 
[18:00]
 All right.  Right on.  So, Mike, I wanted to spread the word of the Opium Anthony show.  You two could be sitting where Mike is.  Wow.  I know.  What a treat.  I know, but.  Nothing like being the first though.  All right.  Hey, you want to sit in the chair that the skank hoe sat in completely naked?  No.  We have it over here in quarantine.  Actually, you're sitting in the chair that Mindy, the model from Big Butt Magazine, sat  in for four hours.  I think we have left over.  Does she fit on this seat here?  Barely, but you're sitting in that same exact seat right now, Mike.  Yeah.  So. 
[18:30]
 All right.  We can confirm that Mike actually handed out the flyers today for our show.  Cool.  And we got a lot to do.  Joe's here, Anthony's brother.  We're going to play some more Goop songs for you.  Yeah.  Give my mic back.  When he's not plugging.  Well, we'll turn you up when you refuse to plug things.  I'll stop plugging.  Nope.  As soon as you plug, the mic goes off.  You're all invited here each week by Opium Anthony to shout a hearty F-U at those Fs.  No, Rudy.  F-U Friday, that is.  Raise some hell. 
[19:00]
 Blow the steam off.  Y'all come back down.  Yeah.  Wow.  I like that.  Thank you.  F-U Friday.  You have that building up all week?  You're pissed?  Your boss wrong you?  Hmm.  Give us a call and let us know.  And Joe whipped that little theme song up.  I think we should send out a challenge for all the bands that listen to us to send in  their F-U Friday theme songs.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  You can get a nice real polished one.  May I be on the judging panel?  Yeah, Joe, you can judge them actually. 
[19:30]
 You're listening to the NAW by the way.  Got a good fax here for F-U Friday.  Opium Anthony, I need to send a big F-U to my wife for getting her period on my first  day of vacation.  Oh no.  That blew.  Red tide.  That's from JD in Edison, New Jersey.  JD, I feel for you.  How long is vacation?  About a week.  Yeah.  That is the worst.  It all depends on how long you're married and where you're going though.  That's true.  If you're taking the kids to Disney, it doesn't really matter much. 
[20:00]
 If you're going up to that Mount Airy Lodge to sit in a champagne glass on your first  anniversary or something, then it might matter.  Hey look, it's a Shirley Temple now.  What happened, honey?  Also in the studio today, Mike from Elmont who supposedly passed out flyers on 56th and  7th.  We reward the people that help us.  We're like the mafia.  You do something for us. 
[20:30]
 You do us a favor.  We will return the favor.  You come on up, Mikey.  We'll take good care of you.  We'll take care of you, Mikey.  I felt bad for you guys.  You guys are crying about not having listeners.  So let me help them out.  Well, I appreciate it.  He passed out flyers.  He passed out 300 flyers, but I'm convinced that he passed them out to blind people because  nobody's called in.  No one's called in.  If you've got a flyer that Mike handed out today on 56th and what, 7th you're at?  Right on the corner.  Yeah, meanwhile he passed them out and these are the guys.  Hey, thank you.  Here's a mega nice pillow. 
[21:00]
 Here for my box.  Mommy, what does that say?  He passed them out though.  Did you pass them out to the guys that are selling the sunglasses out there?  Actually, I tried to pass them out to a bunch of chicks.  Did you?  Very nice.  There you go.  You're smart.  He was just using it to try to pick up girls.  Hoping it sparks conversation.  Actually, I'm kind of an item with someone else right now.  How are you?  Which is Christina.  Say hello to Mike.  Another guy plugging.  Everyone's plugging.  All right, now Mike has his mic off now. 
[21:30]
 I just got this fax from the gang at Town Square Deli in Chatham, New Jersey.  A big FU to this guy.  They faxed the news story.  Which one?  This is the story of the day.  Let me just read a little part of this.  The man called Long Branch police to report that someone had stabbed him in the crotch  as he slept.  But officers who responded quickly saw what had really happened.  The man had been having sex with a vacuum cleaner which severed part of his penis. 
[22:00]
 Every guy out there is holding his crotch right now.  I remember reading that.  The 51-year-old man nearly died as a result of his injury Monday afternoon.  The man had expected the device's suction to provide him with some satisfaction.  But what he didn't realize is that there's a blade in the vacuum cleaner right under  where the hose attaches that pushes the dust into the collected bag.  Oh my goodness.  Oh my lord.  So he was actually humping the machine, not the hose. 
[22:30]
 Oh right, yeah.  Where it chops up before it goes into the bag.  When he turned the vacuum on, the blade severed about a half inch causing severe bleeding.  Really?  I would think.  Oh, that would leave you with what?  Like a half inch.  You got me.  That's right.  I'm hung like an acorn, Anthony.  You got me.  Too quick for me.  The doctors were unable to reattach the... 
[23:00]
 I love that reaction.  I love that particular reaction to what Anthony nailed you with something.  You know that didn't change.  It didn't change from junior high.  I know.  Oh my god.  Alright, more to do.  Alright, man.  We got the Rolling Stones on the way, some R.E.M. and a couple more Goop songs from Anthony  and his brother Joe.  Which one are you guys going to do in a little while?  I don't know, we're going to do the morgue.  The Frank Sinatra morgue song.  We'll just do a couple of ditties from the past maybe.  A little retrospect. 
[23:30]
 I should try to sum up.  I think you guys got...  I got a copy of the Cuban Refugee song.  Oh, we can't do that live.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York with the Rolling Stones and Sophie and Anthony.  And now the WNEW Weekend Weather Check sponsored by Hush Home Video.  Alright, we don't usually do weather.  They don't get it.  We don't do weather on our show.  Alright, go do the weather.  I'm going to go to the WNEW Weather Center.  Hold on.  He's going to...  He's going to... 
[24:00]
 He's going to the window.  Hold on, I got to open it.  Okay, this is the weather.  Be careful, Anthony.  Jesus.  It's kind of cloudy and overcast.  Alright.  I see the sidewalks a little wet.  It looked to be a little rain.  Hey, Joe, hold his legs.  He's going to fall out the window.  Alright.  Easy.  It's just a little breezy.  Not really that windy.  I would say a high temperature. 
[24:30]
 About 65 to 70.  Okay, good.  Let me swing you around the corner.  Alright.  He's back in.  I almost touched the Skanko chair.  I know.  We've had it in the corner ever since he sat in it.  The thing's crawling on the chair.  That is so funny because it has just sat there for the last week.  It's growing cultures.  We're making yogurt in the corner.  Everyone is paranoid to touch the chair. 
[25:00]
 Okay, so that was the weather.  This weekend, Rent Hush, a wicked suspense thriller starring Jessica Lange and Gwyneth  Paltrow, for the first time in a while.  I got to read it like that because I didn't see the movie.  Let me read some of that.  I want to try reading one.  Next one.  Alright.  It is FU Friday, 212-757-1027 if you want in on the fun.  I got a good fact here from Jessica from Rockville Center.  It says, Opie and Anthony, FU tall the New York Ranger fans for calling us nomads.  I've been hearing this all week. 
[25:30]
 I'm an Islander fan and it's tough times for us right now.  Islanders, we have no homeland.  White men take away our home.  Put us on reservation in Lake Placid.  So they left the Coliseum because they say it's dangerous.  Well, the fact goes on, the Islanders may not have a home but they still have a dynasty.  Now listen to me, Islanders.  I would stay in the Coliseum for this fact.  They kind of play like crap. 
[26:00]
 And to sell more tickets, if there's a chance to scoreboard my fall on the team, I'd go.  I would.  I haven't been to Gorilla Go.  People are looking at me like, shut up, there's Islander fans out there.  I'll be honest.  They say to scoreboard my fall.  I'll be honest.  I'm just depressed.  The team has stunk for many years.  A guy a few years ago tries to buy the team and he didn't even have enough money in his  bank account.  That's shite stuff. 
[26:30]
 That was fun.  And now we don't have a place to play but Gary Bettman was in town and he's not satisfied  that the place is strong enough to play.  See, I don't have a clue as to why don't they just fix it.  Replace the bolts.  Yeah, new bolts on the scoreboard.  I think it's a little more than that.  Of course.  I'm sure the story will come out soon.  They want a nice big arena.  Yes, they do.  And they don't deserve it.  They're using this fear tactic that it's not a safe place to try to get a better place. 
[27:00]
 Very intelligent conversation.  Thank you, Opie.  You might be onto something.  Correspondent Anthony on the scene in Nashville County.  Okay, everyone's requesting the morgue song by Anthony and his brother Joe.  That's why Joe is in here.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York Pearl Jam from Yield Wishlist.  It's Opie and Anthony and Anthony's brother Joe sitting in on the morgue.  Brother Joe sitting in on the show today.  We're going to do a little retrospective of some of our little song parodies that we've done. 
[27:30]
 Opie.  Because if anybody doesn't know, that's how me and Opie hooked up in the radio biz.  That's right.  Yeah, I was working on Long Island doing a night show.  I came banging on a door one night.  Yeah, you did.  Actually, Joe hooked me and Anthony up.  Yeah, that's true.  Joe stopped by with this unbelievable song that Anthony and Joe did.  The OJ song.  When the OJ thing was hot.  When OJ was as hot as Clinton is now, I asked all the local bands on Long Island to come up with song parodies. 
[28:00]
 I think OJ was even hotter than Clinton is now.  All Clinton did was splooge and we all know it.  OJ made a bigger mess over a lot more clothing.  That's true.  So I encouraged all the bands to come up with wacky songs about the OJ trial.  Anthony and his brother came up with the best one by far.  That's how me and Anthony hooked up.  Then we started doing radio together.  What was that, like five years ago now? 
[28:30]
 That's right, you band wrecker.  Actually, I broke up the band.  You broke up the band.  You were the Yoko Ono of rock-cut.  That's right.  I hope he was.  Since then, one of the things that me and Anthony have had on our show is a lot of these song parodies and group songs.  Just about all of them are produced by Anthony and his brother Joe.  We don't need a service to do these.  No, honestly, a lot of radio stations in town get services and stuff to give them their group songs. 
[29:00]
 I like doing them myself.  Exactly.  Like Red Peters, How's Your Whole Family, of course.  But at least we give credit where credit is due.  Exactly.  A lot of these songs have been played in the New York area before me and Anthony came back home.  Now we're back and now they can't play those songs anymore and make believe it was there.  Now this little ditty, unfortunately, we were between jobs when we wrote this one.  Wrote it about a year ago, waiting for Frank Sinatra to die to play it. 
[29:30]
 Yeah, me and Anthony were sitting on this song for what, about a year?  About a year, because it looked like Frank had these false alarms every couple of months.  In fact, when we sat down to write this, he was on his deathbed.  We figured it would be a death story within like a week.  We figured we'd get it on the air.  And he hung on until me and Opie got the boot from Boston.  We got fired and then, at insult to injury, then Frank Sinatra died.  He has the nerve to drop dead while we're in between jobs. 
[30:00]
 But that doesn't stop us.  We'll do it anyway.  So yeah, let's do that Frank Sinatra song.  This is a little ditty for Frank.  Start digging the dirt, start grieving today.  They're pulling a sheet over my face, the morgue, the morgue. 
[30:30]
 This little cold room, my skin's turning gray.  I've got a tag around my toe, the morgue, the morgue.  And soon they'll put me in a hole that's six feet deep.  My blue eyes shut very tight in eternal sleep. 
[31:00]
 I have passed a way wearing my toupee.  I've got a death certificate, the morgue, the morgue.  And please pardon me, because they're, yeah, they're embalming me. 
[31:30]
 Old blue eyes in the morgue, the morgue, the morgue.  Old blue eyes, chairman of the morgue, baby.  Thank you.  I think people are driving off the road right now.  Poor Frank.  He had to die when we were off the air, so we have to do it now.  What do you mean, man?  It was me. 
[32:00]
 And if you think that song is tasteless, stick around for the Cuban refugee song.  Don't conk, conk, a chong.  Also, there's some 12-year-old kid on the line that you made a song parody about Bill and Monica,  and he wants to see what you guys think of it.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, the latest from Kenny Wayne Shepard on FU Friday.  That's somehow, somewhere, someway.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Anthony's brother John.  It's something on the phone lines.  You never know what you're going to hear when you tune us in, that's for sure. 
[32:30]
 We've got a 12-year-old kid that has a song parody about Bill and Monica.  We're not doing many song parodies about Bill and Monica today.  We're talking about them.  He gets sick of it.  He's 12.  It scares me that a 12-year-old kid would even attempt to make a song parody out of  the Bill and Monica thing.  I've got to hear it.  You want to give this kid a chance?  I don't even think I'd try to tackle that one.  Hey, kid, let's hear your song.  Okay, here it is. 
[33:00]
 Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's papers and she calls him a hushy lovin' man.  And she likes to have the licks to explain his pain.  And she'll have the licks to explain his shit.  About what I heard during the latest conversation.  I will say without the moment of hesitation.  Oh, mama did what I shout. 
[33:30]
 Bill, get out!  Get out!  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  His Christian valuations have gone to hell these days.  Oh, he's a God-fearing hushy lovin' man.  And she likes to have the licks to explain his shit.  About what I heard during the latest conversation.  I will say without the moment of hesitation. 
[34:00]
 Oh, mama did what I shout.  Bill, get out!  Get out!  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's capers and she calls him a hushy lovin' man.  That's good.  What's your name?  My name is Skidmark.  Skidmark?  And I'm 12 years old. 
[34:30]
 That's pretty funny.  Yeah, yeah, you'll be hearing from me more.  Alright Skidmark, cool.  Very good.  Thanks.  There you go Skidmark, the 12 year old kid.  Skidmark's gotta go off the helium.  That was pretty good.  Skidmark alias Alfalfa Schweitzer.  That's what it was.  It sounded like from The Little Rascals.  Alfalfa.  Friends, Romans, and country shimmies.  Hey, we're spanking.  That one Alfalfa used to sing all those songs? 
[35:00]
 Yep.  I'm the barber of Seville.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  It sounded like The Little Rascals.  Get a hold of Hal Roach.  Have him sign that kid up.  We should ask Skidmark if he had personality.  He's got the little hair poking out.  Skidmark, you have personality?  Skidmark can't come to school today.  Mother cut off her finger. 
[35:30]
 Skidmark can't come to school today.  Mama shot Papa.  Hey Skidmark, can I have your pocket knife?  You get killed?  I just got to hear just a tiny bit more of this.  Okay, here it is.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  That could shatter glass.  It's catchy though, isn't it?  Oh, catchy.  It'll be in my head all night. 
[36:00]
 I'll remember that song.  Oh, very good Skidmark.  Hold back with any parodies you might have in your brain, right?  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's paper and she calls him a hushy loving man.  A hushy loving man?  Skidmark is the king of the show today without a doubt.  No one's going to top that one today.  I'll tell you one thing, whether you're liking it or not, you're going to be hearing that at 2 in the morning if you wake up. 
[36:30]
 I just can't get it out of my head.  Why did I have to look dope in Anthony today?  Yeah.  Skidmark.  Cheryl Crow, my favorite mistake on the Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  It's dope.  It's Ant.  It's Ant's brother Joe.  Ant's brother Joe.  Ant's brother Joe, yes.  Okay.  Ant's brother Joe.  Hey, we got to do the weather again, Ant.  We do already?  And now the WNEW Weekend Weather Check sponsored by Hush Home Video.  Should I pull up the Doppler WNEW Doppler 5000? 
[37:00]
 Yeah, why don't you do that?  It's 1000 better than the Doppler 4000.  Okay.  That they have.  Well, we've got to give some type of forecast here, so why don't you give it to us, Ant?  Okay, as I look at the Doppler 5000, which is out our window actually.  Okay.  It looks kind of cooler than it has been lately.  All right.  I'm saying about what, 65 degrees?  Sounds good.  It's a little hazy, overcast, damp.  All right.  And a little drizzle.  Yeah.  I would say gradual darkening. 
[37:30]
 Darkening of the sky toward evening.  Yes.  Okay, very good.  That's enough.  This weekend, Red Hush, a wicked suspense thriller starring Jessica Lange and Gwyneth  Paltrow from Columbia TriStar.  There you go.  All right.  All right, man.  Well, I don't know.  I think it's time to play the Cuban drama.  Ah, yes.  When was this one originally?  This one was originally for the flotilla, right?  Yeah, they had the-  Boat people?  Yeah, boat people.  They were coming over on everything, scraps of wood.  And we were pissed.  Yeah. 
[38:00]
 Scraps of wood, whatever they could-  Kick the boxes.  Pick up out of the garbage and float over.  So you guys came up with a song, a little ditty.  And our guitar player in this is actually a Cuban.  Cuban dude.  And he had to sit through us doing this.  Trexy.  All right, so, all right, it's a song about Cubans finding stuff to float to America.  He helped on the vocals.  Yeah.  He was in there doing the-  So this is the disclaimer, so when we get all the Cubans mad at us-  We actually had a Cuban.  We'll be okay? 
[38:30]
 I'll tell you complaints to Rex.  He's Cuban.  That's right.  All right, well this is-  That makes you want to do the swing.  Wow.  Oh my goodness.  I kind of forgot how that song went.  I can smell the complaint letters coming in.  I guess shove a motor up her ass, use her as a bug.  How was that?  I guess my chances of running for any political office are pretty well. 
[39:00]
 Nick's down after that one.  Oh man.  Well that's a great little song you guys came up with.  That's great.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's Rock God in the Cuban Drown song.  I have no idea who did that song actually.  But Rex, your guitar player is Cuban.  Yeah, he's Cuban.  Is that the disclaimer?  He wrote the whole thing.  He did.  Oh, okay.  He played it all on him.  It's in his biography.  It's a true story.  That's right.  Actually, he co-wrote it with Fidel Castro.  Yeah.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York. 
[39:30]
 We've got to teach Joe radio etiquette there.  When the little light's on, don't talk and definitely don't curse.  On the air.  See, then you don't talk until the time is up.  That's why I was pointing to that because when I was talking, the light wasn't on.  Soapy and Anthony, we're not going to acknowledge Joe's break.  I'm serious.  All right.  All right.  I had to deal with it so many years in my life.  Say hi to the people at www.mybosssucks.com. 
[40:00]
 They put a little banner up on their site featuring us.  Really?  Yes, they did.  They said, we just created a banner ad and placed it on a web page.  Check it out.  It's at mybosssucks.com.  Now, are they part of Phase 2 in the Opie and Anthony program to get more listeners?  Yes, I think they like us.  They said, Howard blew us off a year ago, the dick.  We'd love to come over and talk about doing something on the side about you guys and your  bosses.  Thanks, James.  We appreciate that.  Yes.  Yes, we do.  By the way, Mike is still hanging out in the studio. 
[40:30]
 Mike from Illinois.  Oh, yeah.  It's awesome.  You're having a good time, Mike?  Yeah, man.  I really know what it's like for him on the other side.  All right.  Do what goes on.  Whatever you want.  Now, tell the listeners that we're actually nice guys when we're not talking on the air  and stuff.  I'm not going to lie.  All right.  They're a real cool guy.  They're making me feel comfortable.  The reason Mike is in here because he decided to take phase two into his hands and he passed  out 300 flyers today all over Midtown that said, check it out, Opie and Anthony, a talk 
[41:00]
 show that's fun.  Give them a chance.  It's worth the laugh.  Monday through Friday, 3 to 7 on 1027 WNEW FM.  The problem is not one person called that got the flyers today.  Geez.  Now, do we believe he really did that?  Yeah.  I'm not responsible for the effort, not the outcome.  All right.  Well, he made the effort and we appreciate that.  That's right.  I'm not responsible to come up with creative ways on how to spread the word of the show  here.  Get more in our Flip Mo Squad.  We need more homes in our Flip Mo Squad. 
[41:30]
 Yeah, we do need that.  Hey, I want to do a tune, man.  You want to do another song?  Yeah, it's a quickie.  Is it as brutal as the Cuban song we just heard a little while ago?  It might be.  I don't know.  All right.  What is this one about?  Well, this one on, we wrote this one a while ago when, who was it?  David Crosby.  David Crosby was getting his liver transplanted.  Getting his liver.  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  Okay, great.  Hey. 
[42:00]
 You, who's a bloated load that had to go for a liver transplant.  Drink, drink like a fish.  Your bile duct has turned to cement.  It's dented black and blue and gray.  Turn your liver to pate.  A useless lump of clay. 
[42:30]
 You've got cirrhosis.  That's a fun little ditty, right?  About cirrhosis of the liver, Opie?  That's right.  That's a cute number.  What a mess we got going on today.  It's fun, right?  Yes, it is.  Sure it is.  Hey, don't forget, Monday morning during the Dave Herman Rock and Roll Morning Show, 
[43:00]
 we will auction off a field box seat tickets to the first two Yankee Playoff games.  Wow.  That's cool.  All proceeds go to the Children's Health Fund.  The games are Tuesday and Wednesday.  So make sure you listen to Dave Herman Monday.  All right.  Hey, speaking of baseball, real fast, did you see the clip of Ted Kennedy on the news  last night?  What a moron.  He was talking about the home run race with Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa.  And he called Mark McGuire Mike.  So he goes, I want to congratulate Mike McGuire.  Mike McGuire.  And Sammy Sassa. 
[43:30]
 Sammy Sassa and Mike McGuire.  Sammy Sassy.  Two fine football players.  Is this guy lost or what?  What a bloated mess.  What does Ted Kennedy have that Bill Clinton wishes he had?  A dead girlfriend.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW, Marcy Playground, Sex and Candy.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Let me try that.  The Rock of New York WNEW, it's Marcy Playground, Sex and Candy.  Wow, look at him. 
[44:00]
 That's great.  Trying it out for your job, Opie.  Did you actually have to live with this guy for how many years?  Many years.  He's out of your house?  Many years.  And this wasn't anything because quite frankly I had a hard time in Elwood Jr. High because  he had the distinction of being the first guy ever caught with pot in Elwood Jr. High.  I got busted, dude.  He did.  I got busted.  It was such a dopey story too.  Mr. Guy.  Mr. Guy.  Remember he ran out onto the playground.  I was sitting out there with all my friends showing off my nickel bag. 
[44:30]
 Mr. Guy ran out and snatched it from my hands but not before I could eat it.  He ate it.  He ate the contents of the bag.  So I had all kinds of green stuff swimming around my teeth and Mr. Guy asked me, what's  that in your mouth?  I said, it's oregano from my pizza pie because it was right outside the lunchroom.  It was on my toes, man.  Thank you.  You and your high.  Wait, Anthony, you've got to tell the pot story. 
[45:00]
 Oh, because I was a goodie.  Two shoes.  Anthony played with microscopes and Joe played with bongs.  Joe was smoking weed and stuff.  I remember the teachers all after this happened because it was a huge deal.  Like, oh my God, pot in Elwood Jr. High.  That's the Burbian.  Anthony made a microscope out of a bong.  So the teachers were coming up to me and saying, taking me aside, is there anything you need?  Any help?  I thought I was going to automatically become this big pothead because of Joe, but I had 
[45:30]
 many years of being a nerd.  I went home one day across the street in the woods from our house.  There was a lot.  Yeah, a little lot.  And I find pot plants.  And I'm talking about Kona Budd that had been cared for and nurtured for months and months  and months.  It was getting close to harvest time.  The County Police Department came to the school like a week before and showed us what pot 
[46:00]
 looked like.  So I'm walking through the woods and I see pot.  I'm like, oh, it's pot.  This is marijuana.  OK, now you have to remember that this pot was not mine.  It wasn't Anthony.  It was the big kids that live next door.  And I'm talking about guys that have been in and out of the joint, bikers.  There were all kinds of like really nasty dudes living next door.  Go on, Ann.  So I uproot the plant.  I grab them, take them home. 
[46:30]
 Now, in the meantime, I'm in the kitchen, stone to the bejesus belt.  I'm sitting down at the kitchen table, sucking on a bowl of fruit loops or something.  And Anthony comes walking through the door.  My mom is washing the dishes.  Anthony comes walking through the door with two lovely bouquets of nearly mature Kona Budd.  Look, mom, marijuana.  Yeah, like I'm going to affect the drugs that are killing our country.  The spoon fell from my mouth with several fruit loops. 
[47:00]
 He knew where they came from.  My mother turned around.  She looked at it.  She goes, take it out in the back and crush it up.  So there I was in the backyard on a cement patio, grinding every single leaf into oblivion,  just grinding it with my shoe.  As Joe looked on like one of those in horror, one of those dogs with the big eyes and the  paintings out the window.  He's just looking like, no, no.  And then like a half hour later, I looked out the backyard and I just see him on his 
[47:30]
 knees trying to find anything, a stem.  Taking up a seed.  Taking up a stem.  And somebody got the living crap kicked out of him because obviously they were accused  of stealing the plants.  Well, no.  What happened was the big guys came to me.  Where's our pot, Joe?  Where did our plants go, Joe?  My brother took them.  You killed him.  No, no, no.  I covered your ass.  Thank you, Joe.  I was as honest a voice as I could muster. 
[48:00]
 I said, Ralph Bastianelli.  Who was Ralph?  He took it.  He was some guy that, he's since died.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  That was the direct result of that.  All right.  Paper trails ended.  Yeah, that's it.  Loose ends, loose ends soda.  You'll never get caught.  That's a good pot story.  Your whole family was a mess though.  What about your uncle?  My uncle, Joe, had pot plants that were like redwood trees. 
[48:30]
 From the second story bathroom, we lived in a cape.  And from the second story bathroom, you could see the buds peeking up from the window sill.  There was an east ice lift and we had a cop living next door.  A police sergeant living next door.  My uncle, who is my mother's brother, had my mother bamboozled into thinking, no, Roe,  it's a basal oregano hybrid I'm developing.  Like he's working for the Department of Agriculture.  And there I was spreading it on the pizza pie and throwing it in the family sundae sauce. 
[49:00]
 But they were huge.  And my father showed up.  Yeah, he didn't live with you guys.  No, no, no.  Horrible story of divorce and heartbreak for the children.  But he shows up and he's like, what the hell?  They're 10 feet tall pot plants doing in the backyard.  We're talking 20 of them.  There had to be 20 of them.  Like what are you doing?  They're going to take the kids away if police find you with plants in the backyard.  And the police are living next door at this point.  And my mother, misknowledgeable about everything.  Oh, Joe, you stupid ass, it's basal oregano hybrid. 
[49:30]
 Don't you know anything?  Basal oregano.  Let me call the cops and tell them about this basal oregano hybrid.  There were a whole lot of people coming in to see Uncle Joe about copping some of that  basal oregano hybrid.  Walking out with huge plastic bags.  I never understood why people would trade perfectly good Fender Stratocaster guitars  and Marshall amps for a basal oregano.  Something you could get for nothing at the supermarket.  But for some reason they were very interested in Uncle Joe's basal oregano. 
[50:00]
 Maybe they were just shopping for Bertucci's or something.  Yeah, Uncle Joe had the best basal oregano.  That's classic.  A lot of pot.  All right, stick around.  On the way we've got the latest from Hole and Led Zeppelin next.  It's 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, as you cruise around town.  That's Hole Celebrity Skin, title track from Courtney Love's new CD.  Joe was jamming to that, huh?  Rock.  The acoustic version without the boobs. 
[50:30]
 All right, don't try to sing about it.  We're just about out of here, I guess, huh?  Yeah, we just got one more little ditty for the ladies.  All right, well, let me thank everyone before we leave.  We've got to thank Rick for producing the show today.  We've got to thank Mike for stopping by from Elmont.  You had a good time, Mike?  I had a full, fellas.  Thanks a lot.  The only reason Mike was in the studio is because he's helping spread the word about  the Opium Anthony show.  We didn't know him from a hole in the wall until he started passing out flyers about  our show. 
[51:00]
 So, Mike, quiet that nobody called.  They caught the flyer.  So next time we'll just have to make a thousand of them.  Oh, yeah, see?  There you go.  And a little challenge to the rest of the faithful listeners out there.  If you come up with a very creative way to spread the word about the Opium Anthony show,  you too could sit where Mike is sitting and watch the operation, watch where the tragic  happens.  Yeah, exactly.  And Mike didn't have to sit in the Skank Whore chair.  So now we have that firmly entrenched in the back of the console.  We're at Dean's crawling on that chair.  It is.  Yes, we also got to thank Joe, Anthony's brother, for stopping by. 
[51:30]
 You guys don't have to thank me.  I know.  We're all hanging out for the next few hours.  Yeah, we're going to hang out.  All right.  And Matt Devotees, up next, we'll have a little bit of a chat with Mike.  We'll see you guys on the radio Monday at 3 and Go Mets Go.  Anthony and Joe will end the show here.  This is for the ladies, you know, what all us guys like for the weekend.  All right?  Here we go.  One, two, three.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us.  Last night you fell asleep, but I want to sink it deep.  Give us a Lewinsky.  Give us. 
[52:00]
 Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us. 
[52:30]
 Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us.  Give us. </pre>
