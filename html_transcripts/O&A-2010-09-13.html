<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts recounting their chaotic return from a two-week vacation in North Carolina, hampered by rain and beach house logistics.  They then discussed their vacation Twitter activity, including a funny story about encountering Chris Cornell, whose home studio work was constantly interrupted by his daughter announcing earthquakes and demanding "shark" in the pool.  A large portion of the show focused on a party guest who stole money from Anthony and a friend, caught on security cameras after triggering Anthony's gun safe alarm. This led to a discussion about the betrayal involved.  Jimmy Norton then joined the conversation, detailing his recent work experiences, including filming for Jay Leno in New Orleans (where he encountered friendly locals) and visiting the Brady Bunch and Back to the Future houses in Los Angeles, culminating in a luxurious stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  The discussion returned to Anthony's party, detailing further mishaps including multiple guest falls and a bowel incident involving a friend, Sal, requiring KY jelly.  Finally, the hosts addressed their impending contract end and the departure of long-time employee Steve, briefly mentioning a dispute with Al Roker about Hurricane Earl.

The next segment opened with a discussion of Steve's departure and his new music, "Foundry Retooled," available on iTunes, including songs like "Pendulum" (about AIDS), a Seattle farm song, and "Ain't Like You" (about straight men). They played both the original and retooled versions of "Pendulum," highlighting the improved production.  This transitioned into a bizarre local news story about a sexually assaulted horse in the Outer Banks, prompting graphic humor.  They then discussed a political candidate, Phil Davidson, whose campaign video resembled a wrestling promo, playing clips showcasing his over-the-top style.  Mark Hoppus (Blink-182) and Amy Schumer then appeared as guests, promoting their Fuse show, "A Different Spin."  Their conversation was filled with off-color jokes, including graphic descriptions of Amy Schumer's nipples and a story about flashing a substitute teacher.  They also discussed various musicians, including Lady Gaga, John Mayer, and Ozzy Osbourne. The segment concluded with "The Wrestler Death Clock," updating listeners on recent wrestler deaths (Lance Cade, Luna Vachon, Bastion Booger), prompting further morbid humor.

A subsequent segment featured continued conversation with Hoppus and Schumer, beginning with a child's surprising Blue Oyster Cult knowledge and moving on to the VMAs and Cher.  The conversation quickly became sexually explicit, with graphic descriptions of genitalia and sexual preferences.  They promoted their show and discussed Travis Barker's unusual post-European tour boat travel (11 days each way), leading to discussions of plane crashes and Barker's fear of flying.  Schumer's upcoming stand-up appearances and experiences in Sweden were also mentioned, along with further explicit discussions of pornography preferences, including a description of a disturbing online image ("blue waffle").  The hosts discussed Schumer's comedic style and its similarity to Nikki Glaser's. A caller, Jay from Jersey, asked about Blink-182's new album.  The segment later discussed a Koran burning incident, leading to commentary on religious tolerance, freedom of speech, and the reaction to 9/11, remaining largely irreverent and offensive.  Staff member Kenny shared details of a disappointing vacation before the guests left, followed by sexually suggestive remarks about Schumer from the hosts.

The show continued with a discussion about the emotional response to 9/11 and controversies surrounding a mosque, featuring strong and vulgar opinions about Islam and American tolerance.  One host referenced a George Carlin HBO special from after 9/11.  The conversation shifted to the hosts' upcoming television project and a co-hosting gig with Amy Schumer, described as having a "foul mouth."  They shared insider information from Chris Cornell about a Soundgarden reunion and then discussed the death of Robert Schimmel, sharing memories and cynical remarks about religious eulogies. A personal anecdote about meeting George Carlin was also shared.  A significant portion was dedicated to a critical and profane discussion of TLC's "Hoarders" and "Freaky Eaters," expressing anger at the participants and the perceived coddling from therapists.  The show concluded with anecdotes about defecating outdoors, escalating into increasingly vulgar and graphic detail. A caller discussed obesity and lack of insurance for weight loss, with the hosts suggesting Overeaters Anonymous.

The final segment focused on defecation in unconventional locations.  The hosts and callers shared various experiences, including one host's claims of repeatedly defecating in pools, another defecating on the Staten Island Expressway, and a caller's story about a friend defecating in her purse during a first meeting with her boyfriend's parents.  Another caller described their fear on a glass box structure high above the ground in Chicago.  The segment ended with a JÃ¤germeister music tour advertisement.

[00:21:30]  money laying around should be people that you talked to once back in 1986 why why did these  people need to be there well it was just uh you know hey people are hanging out right uh if if a  friend of mine wants to invite a couple of people over i assume he is being responsible and inviting  people uh that will not cause a problem sure you know it's how it works i know uh 
[00:22:00]  uh i got a friend uh zach uh from uh apple store zach zeffron no just hang with zach zeffron and  and and he's like yeah uh i'll come by he goes you mind if i bring a couple of people i'm like i don't  care because i know zach will be cool he'll bring a couple of dopey drunks and they'll just sing  karaoke and that'll be fine right but uh yeah so these these two people come by and it's a guy and  his uh his uh his um overweight ugly girlfriend and um here we go they're sitting they're sitting 
[00:22:30]  out back at the table were you suspicious ever not a hint of suspicion handshake looked you in the  eye thanks for having me beers laughing you know just another person at the party do you know when i  met him i again met the guy yes uh i got a weird feeling but it was there was no indication of 
[00:23:00]  it was just like and that was well he apparently was very excited about seeing jimmy norton was he  he was very excited i he told the person that invited him um that he was uh a little starstruck  i like this guy slightly starstruck i like how danny's typing things like he knows everything  that happened that night kind of weird that he knows yeah isn't it wanted a picture well he could  have taken one we could stand there yeah he could have taken a picture gone upstairs to my room and 
[00:23:30]  taken a piece of art off the wall take that home too can i take a picture sure which one  fucking thief so uh so here's how here's how it plays out we're all partying we're various parts  of the house i guess uh mr norton and uh some friends are in the jacuzzi yeah um i was downstairs  in the basement which i figure now uh that i need one of those giant bells like silence of the lambs 
[00:24:00]  to go off in the basement when the alarm goes off because i don't hear it oh you didn't hear shit  no the alarms went off though well yes so we're all you know where do you hear the alarm house i  didn't hear it in the jacuzzi no oh man what's up with you i know i got it now i know you gotta get  these alarms lit i was in the jacuzzi lounging around with uh with my gal yes and talking to uh let's  just say a friend's gal who was very nice right but we couldn't hear any noise until people ran over 
[00:24:30]  and go the alarm's going off yeah so jacuzzi was loud you know janine love janine makeup janine  that's psycho her and uh she had a gentleman friend there were uh luckily sitting on my couch  inside was she cutting herself at that moment no no cutting was going on she's she's do you think  she's a cutter i think she's a cutter she should be if she's not yeah i hope she just won across the  throat for the cutters out there do the neck stop with the silly wrist shit please go right 
[00:25:00]  for the jugular so uh when you mean business yeah she's sitting uh on the couch with a gentleman  friend and they're watching television the gentleman friend i find out later about this  but he sees upstairs because you could see part of my upstairs the balcony uh from the seat gotcha  that they were sitting in so the gentleman friend is looking and noticing there's somebody upstairs  and why is somebody up there well it's this guy and he's coming out of one of the rooms and now he's 
[00:25:30]  walking toward my bedroom but the alarm's blaring not yet the alarm hadn't gone off yet oh so they saw  before the alarms went off he's now walking toward my bedroom so within a few minutes did he not know  that they were seeing him go by i have no idea what he knew or thought or anything but uh as he uh walks  by a couple of minutes later all hell breaks loose the alarms going off so i get a call from central 
[00:26:00]  monitoring i i answer it i'm like uh all right i go to my keypad by my front door and i'm trying to key  in the code and it's not stopping so i go what i go this isn't even tripped what's going on she goes  no it's your upstairs closet and i'm like oh fuck that's my gun closet vault it's separate alarm and  it's got magnetic locks on it so you got to put in like it's a few steps you got to do you're pretty  much to disarm to disarm it you need two people turn your key sir right turn your key sir one of 
[00:26:30]  those the magnetic locks disengage and then the door can be opened so well he apparently went in  there and tugged on the door very hard setting the alarm off uh did he know it was a gun closet  i have no idea would you know it was a gun closet i wouldn't have known unless i listened to this  program and right you know but the average person wouldn't know wouldn't know would just probably  right it would be a true dummy that would tug on a door with an armed alarm keypad 
[00:27:00]  right next to the door jesus it says armed and red fucking light letters and uh he tugged on this  thing and the alarm goes off so now so now uh he kind of disappears well i got surveillance cameras  not in my house but all around my house uh we later go in to look at the replay of the surveillance 
[00:27:30]  cameras when the alarm goes off you could see a little commotion going on around the house you  could tell the alarm went off there's no sound but you could you could tell from the way people are  acting you see him come out my front door go out the driveway around the side of my house through the  back gate around the side and sits back down next to his chick instead of walking right out the back  door which was 20 feet away from him he went out the front door which is at the base of my stairs that 
[00:28:00]  go upstairs and went all the way around the house uh without anybody seeing him except for every camera  on my house right track this guy walking uh around the outside of the house so another great smart move  because i do have law officers at my house at the party so yeah this guy's just a genius so they take  him aside and you know give him a little interrogation and he cracks he tells the uh the officer on scene 
[00:28:30]  uh he goes um you know i was just taken by the whole thing and i've been down on my luck and uh i was i was  looking for money jesus yeah so now i'm like fucking fuming i'm ready to like really bodily throw this  motherfucker out of my house right well he slipped out him and his chick boom gone gone so now i'm like 
[00:29:00]  wait after the interrogation that they were able to slip out yeah yeah they they when when one of the  cop guys came to get me that guy fucking ran to his car and took off with his chick gone so uh i'm  like thinking now i gotta let me look around so i open up the closet i check i make sure all the  armaments are still there everything's there um and then i'm like fuck my wallet was up here shit  so i look at my wallet i don't keep cashing my wallet but uh my credit cards and they were all there 
[00:29:30]  and then um my uh uh my lovely female friend visitor from los angeles came back with me  how close of a friend very close friend uh her wait did you ever uh you know i could have  could have she had make out have you make i think there was there was heavy petting heavy petting  have you rubbed your genitals together through clothing dry humping 
[00:30:00]  the uh her pocketbook was hooked on one of the little posts on my bed right and uh she checked her  wallet like 1200 bucks she had 1200 on her she's out from la you know gone fucking gone and then i  noticed in my top drawer uh like 300 is gone out of my top drawer so this guy just grabbed money 
[00:30:30]  shoved it in his fucking pocket oh wow went down lied because we we didn't check him we well we  confronted him first right and then was like you know hey you were seen upstairs no i wasn't upstairs  no it's like no this guy i saw you and then the cop talked to him and he fessed up to it and he took  off um i was pissed that we didn't know he had taken anything until uh he was gone so the next day the 
[00:31:00]  police arrive call the uh police assort county detectives the whole deal why next day uh well  it was too good it was 2 30 in the morning or three o'clock by that point so you know next day  next day they get the call right and uh send everybody over uh take some pictures a lot of  statements and uh it's felony larceny felony grand larceny so as far as i know last i heard he's got 
[00:31:30]  a felony grand larceny warrant out for him and do they get him i don't know yet wow i don't know but uh  they don't just those those warrants don't just go away so you know if you're out and about they will  get you um yeah so the like the nerve and it's like i was thinking of it this way too look he don't  know me from a hole in the fucking wall i don't know him he could be the biggest scumbag he could  be down on his luck whatever he's ripping me off who uh but to fuck your friend over like that 
[00:32:00]  to be invited somewhere by a friend that's bad you know has a certain trust and everything  is such a fucking of of your supposed friend that that transcends like stealing shit the the  principle of of just fucking your friend over um and the jokes didn't start if i couldn't find my 
[00:32:30]  keys it was like hey um danny did anyone come over jokes didn't stop you mean oh they oh yeah  the jokes didn't start oh sorry they started the second that guy left the house how well did this  when was the last time you hung with that dude it wasn't too long it wasn't too long  before yeah like leading up to the to this like we had been trying like our schedules just didn't  line up like we had you know uh we was on fucking probation yeah yeah you wanted to meet somewhere 
[00:33:00]  and he was busy knocking over a house hey man you want to meet over at uh buster and dave i can't  we're gonna bash no lady in the head take her purse yeah we try to figure out a day to you know to ride  our motorcycles together danny was a good second story man wow yeah that's a hell of a buzz you don't  know your friend you know you're gonna go riding yeah it was just one of those things steal a bike  fucker and uh at the beginning of of of this party there really wasn't a lot of uh of of people 
[00:33:30]  that were known to to be coming right so it was like you know what this could be like four people  this could be 12 people who knows yeah we didn't know at that point so i was like oh screw it and  that's when i was like hey you mind if a buddy of mine comes by i'm like cool there was plenty of  food and everything we weren't sure how many grew up with the guy yeah yeah we i mean  you know there was a long stretch of of of time where like it was every every day it was like  that was the crew and then what i don't know where he went you know went away no no no it was 
[00:34:00]  went away went away you know i he would just see a girl steal a kiss  any thieving joke here it comes you know how you get but uh yeah what would you guys do  listen to rolling stone albums sticky fingers  i don't even have anything to say i can't even say oh no are you embarrassed he felt so bad dude 
[00:34:30]  i have never seen such a dejected danny oh and and danny just had a horrid week anyway a real good  week i was having a real bad week apparently a um a carpet cleaning machine was needed at my house  and what i so much shit on the rug i was that's a hell of a carpet cleaning machine oh yeah yeah yeah  for carpet for for the the the um persian rug in my living room what wait see well when i was in 
[00:35:00]  la uh i i had danny watch the house you know i like people over there making sure somebody's  there then not there except you know certain friends i guess good to have somebody you know  be watching the ceiling fan you know i guess someone had a case the joint got to make sure  the lights are on he didn't know this guy i mean it was thick as thieves at one point  but but um what happened on the rug what happened nothing that stains it wasn't bad it was just red 
[00:35:30]  wine i fell oh no red wine stains it oh oh does it yeah it fell on a rug that if if i hadn't bought  the rug i could have bought a car that it's just why why would you need a rug that expensive you don't  but it's a luxury item for what though well it goes with the rest of the motifs i've seen those  rugs they look like rugs mad no yeah there's a difference you could tell all right you could 
[00:36:00]  tell the difference all right it's like a off the rack thing or a tailored armani suit it's a  gentleman's rug right and uh yeah so that happened and then i i heard tell there was a uh rental of  a rug cleaner from a home depot and oh you tried to clean up before he got back well i said you're  like you're like the parent he was your son yeah no he was either uh not ferris bueller it was risky 
[00:36:30]  business business danny was risky business there was guido did you take that old wallet off the shelf  did you have guido the killer pimp over anthony's alley he did there's just a there was a moment of  sheer panic like you know when you when you just you you're frozen but you know that every second  counts at the same time you broke the egg the second the wine starts spilling you go into that  matrix freeze thing yeah and spin around knowing like you can't stop this wait now the why were you 
[00:37:00]  holding it when it spilled did you doze off or did you knock it off something i don't know what  happened you passed out on your face what i i think what i had done i love the i think what i done  that means there was a good buzz going on it wasn't like it wasn't like piecing this together  for a while i think i got it now it wasn't a super full glass or anything but this is tangerine  dream by the way for the people out there that don't know i was watching television and i leaned  forward and stupidly instead of putting the glass like on like the little the flat surface that would 
[00:37:30]  make sense for you to do so of course i just kind of put it on the floor for like two seconds just  as i was leaning forward and then i think i leaned back forgot oh and then i went to like i went to like  cross my leg and like the tip of my toe hit it and i was like what the hell was oh yeah  and did you panic and hope you just had water in it for a second i'm just looking going like i don't  i don't even know what to do like i don't even know what to do i don't know how to fix this like  i'm looking going you shouldn't even try because it's at the house on fire just danny then sets the 
[00:38:00]  house on fire to cover up a spill on the rug jesus so i tried uh i worked on it for probably like an  hour oh shit what'd you try and i'm trying to convince myself in his mouth and squeeze  just uh you know everything i could think i couldn't find like proper cleaning fluids  so i was just trying to like dilute and just move the piece of furniture over it well you know  at one point the thoughts had crossed my mind i was just like i could just pull the ottoman 
[00:38:30]  probably wouldn't know probably think he did it but then i had to make an emergency call i was just  like yeah something needs to happen here so i pick up a rug cleaner call another one of your  friends yeah exactly you should just call that guy would have stole you one right  i don't know what happened someone stole your persian rug so that that happened and then the  the thievery did it get cleaned up yeah yeah yeah you can't even tell you can't even tell 
[00:39:00]  look at that i came home to look and i was like i don't even know where it is you can tell  i didn't i didn't even know where it was i couldn't tell uh so so after that and then the  thievery danny's feeling a little low so we figure you know i get home and we're hanging out i figure  let's pop some sweet berry wine and just hang out by the bar and uh maybe you know danny's playing  some video game or some shit on the on the video game console did you tussle his head no i don't think 
[00:39:30]  we'd have had to tussle no tussling going on but he made you feel a little better he sure tussled  his wine glass because that fell right on the white carpet on my fucking floor in the basement  jesus at which point danny collapses onto his knees curses and throws a chair across the room  like a wrestler and what did he break doing that what did he break doing this to stay my fucking week  hurricane danny oh hurricane danny i was dealing with hurricane early you had hurricane danny 
[00:40:00]  i think hurricane danny was worse that came up uh very easy though and very quickly yeah luckily that  was a lot like scotch garden that was a lot easier we had some specialty cleaner for it and everything  so that came up easier but i was just like and keith was over uh we just started laughing we couldn't  stop laughing we're like this motherfucker is feeling like shit keith just came over like they're  laughing and they and keith just comes over and he just gives me a hug yeah yeah keith gave him a big  hug it was a wreck it had to happen like it couldn't have it couldn't have happened any other way like 
[00:40:30]  of course yeah of course it had to happen and then uh uh oh oh by the way uh the thief's uh uh chick  she had a full beer and completely fell down the stairs of the basement and doused her beer all over  her head i don't even think any got on the floor she was doused in beer and then i think janine took  a header did janine fall down again i don't know she does this would be the second time she would 
[00:41:00]  have fallen at my house really she bounces into the columns she fucking she she's wearing socks and  will just fall down the stairs it's it's unbelievable one of those scared goats yes she just falls down  she's she's she's hungry she skinned her knees that's what it was yeah she skinned both knees  falling down that's what she told you ah was that it of course she's probably sucking dick for gas 
[00:41:30]  money oh shit she had gravel on her knees  it means a psycho yeah she's behind a sunoco in a good way though man she's got some of that good  psycho in her oh yeah yeah she's uh she's always a good she was there last night when we had um  sal's birthday party last night which was i can't i can't keep up with this oh oh it lost me a long  time ago well it was all was all this one party i don't it it might as well all of blended together 
[00:42:00]  there were people coming and going and and uh but the the south did you have a i'm going back to work  party is that what happened yesterday no that was a i really do not like the idea that i got to wake  up early but people are over kind of party and i did curb uh the drinking that i had been doing  during the week it was just like but it's sunday i better cool it uh steven s from basher janine  walks like big a talks oh i like that yeah she uh she really just she falls down it's great 
[00:42:30]  muscular dystrophy just walking and collapsing uh but sal's uh birthday had had a moment  um sal as you know he went through some um uh heart heart surgery he had he had a valve put in  about a month or two months ago i didn't know that maybe maybe longer is he feeling better yeah yeah  he's feeling better he's doing good no no this is a valve they take like a cow valve and put it in 
[00:43:00]  my dad had one of those it's like a pig or cow yeah they take a valve in there and you're fine  throw it in the shit they can do with the heart oh it's pretty amazing hearted so uh so he's there  but you know they got him on certain kind of medication how's your mom's uh husband there  mom's a hubby that don't know um and uh yeah everyone knows sal  uh so so he uh he he takes him a medicine which i think um uh backs him up a little gets him a little 
[00:43:30]  constipated oh no so he's like uh can i use your bathroom over here so i sent him one of the you  know far off bathrooms where he could spend some time did you have to get another things out did  you have to get another carpet cleaner no no no no no thank god but um all right good he was in  there a while and then he comes out and he's like anthony do you have like an old towel i can put  making a circle and put on my chair so i could sit like i guess he was having a hard time you know 
[00:44:00]  straining pushing and whatnot an old towel did he pop out a hemorrhoid uh he you know yeah he wanted  to make it into like a hoop right you know so so like a child rape victim exactly  uh like edward norton in american history x he's just laying on his stomach crying through a black  man he had to make a little thing for his hiney yeah he wanted he wanted to make a little thing  for his hiney so i got one and uh that was bad enough does he want you talking about this it got 
[00:44:30]  worse i i don't i don't know but i said i go i can't not talk about this a little inner tube type  thing yeah so that works for a few minutes and then he's like i gotta go i gotta i'm gonna explode  so he's like do you have any vaseline  i know now i'm please tell me you had to apply it i'm mortified i'm just like he's got he's gotta 
[00:45:00]  go he needs a little vaseline to get things rolling at his own birthday party i know at  his own birthday party maybe danny could have called his friend and could have told him there's  some money up there some cash up there right so danny apply the vaseline well if i then you could  call it even if i had some vaseline yeah i would have you know now your police tell me you had tiger  bomb instead well i uh no not tiger bomb your parents are getting up there now yeah are you getting 
[00:45:30]  to the stage where you gotta do some things yet it's just no no are you there yet no no no i don't  have to do things but trust me the questions that like do you have this or that you're gonna have to  do things it happens to the best of us i thought i'm one of seven i thought i could i i wouldn't be  the guy that would have to do some things you're gonna have to do some things but you're getting  closer doing some things it was bad enough having to search my medicine cabinet for vaseline which i 
[00:46:00]  knew he was gonna you have to wipe up and shove up there to lube up a big fucking bowling ball worth  of shit so uh i look around i don't have vaseline but now i do remember i do have some ky jesus um  you applied ky but no no i didn't apply anything mom's fucking husband but it was ky extra with the  tingly heating sensation so i didn't tell him this i just went downstairs and went here you go 
[00:46:30]  this is all i have did you know it had the tingling sensation oh yeah what the fuck's wrong with you  i knew it had it but hey he needed it and it's lube you know what's going on with sal's ass you know  how much that's gonna burn so so he goes into another bathroom and um after a while comes back  out and he's like my ass is burning he goes but it worked and then he goes do you have a plunger 
[00:47:00]  like a fucking movie i know he clogged the toilet oh yeah i'm like there i guess there's one in  another bathroom i got the it's like yeah so he goes in there i guess with the plunger was he  embarrassed or he didn't give a fuck they are at the point where i don't think they care it's just  here's what's happening here's what's here's my day do you have a plunger it's that point it's like 
[00:47:30]  so uh he he comes back out now they're ready to leave and he goes uh i left the plunger in the sink  so there's a bathroom at my house that i never use with a plunger in the sink and then a shit  covered plunger and then he goes to hand me back the ky extra extreme and i just went sal you keep  that did you go get the plunger no it's still there in my sink i wasn't getting the plunger and it will 
[00:48:00]  will be until either his friend steals it or he throws it on the rug what's wrong when you fuck  the picture of the brady bunch house who gives a shit you tweet the fucking plunger or the dump  would have been great oh i can imagine what that looked like yeah holy shit like a fucking pot roast  someone put a goddamn uh meatloaf in my in my turlet how old sal now did he have a big birthday  in the 70s you know early 70s kind of thing yeah it was uh you know the the whole family came over

[00:51:30]  hurricane or all yeah i fucking hate al roker big fucking uh uh uh media blow up bullshit al roker and i  were going at it on twitter al roker yeah because i i fucking called him out for being a fear monger  and he goes you're watching aren't you i called him out too it ended in the same letter  right you misspelled monger  friends are all monger lovers because honestly you don't give a shit about this fear mongering crap 
[00:52:00]  until it affects you personally and i saw like people completely losing their minds because of this  hurricane earl stuff yeah when i had my brother who does way better weather than al roker because  he's kind of a scientist so he studies maps and goes we're fine where we are and in the end we were  fine where we were everyone knew but everyone panics and the and uh state of emergency everyone's got  to get the fuck out al roker's like yeah this is going to be another katrina blah blah blah he's a 
[00:52:30]  piece of shit so trina so i tweeted that al roker is basically a piece of shit so he writes back  you're watching aren't you not knowing that i watched these horseshit people on tv to kind of  kind of you know be up on the whole fear mongering and the culture of fear thing blowing it out of  proportion right by the way by saying you're watching aren't you gives away that they're doing  it to get people to watch yes thank you jimmy thank you exactly what it is so i wrote back al roker 
[00:53:00]  you're a dope you're a dope you're ruining people's vacations do you understand that my  vacation wasn't ruined because i i had two weeks so we did have to get out of there for a day which  i was so frustrated i'm like i want to stay in my fucking house i know it's gonna be oh i i tweeted  made videos everything i was the last thing you want i was in a horrible uh you know get off the  island you've seen a million times on fucking tv traffic how many i read i read you it was 20 miles 
[00:53:30]  but how long did that take you honestly what ended up happening because i didn't give the  update it turned out it was an accident it had nothing to do with uh volume and then finally  they they cleared the accident but it was one of those uh traffic jams where we all just got out  of our cars oh just hung out for i don't even know at least two hours at least a few of those  i've never at least two hours a car like that yeah so yeah i don't know and then we had to go to a  hotel 60 miles away and i'm like i just want to be in my awesome beach house that i rented 
[00:54:00]  for two weeks and we don't need to be in a stupid holiday inn express with a dumb pool oh god  i was so frustrated because i knew this hurricane was nothing as far as where we were why 60 miles  away do we was that the closest one i don't it's a whole thing you couldn't get a closer one i don't  know i guess what is that like kind of the mandatory distance i guess you figure let's get an hour away  i don't know i don't know hotel you're fine hotel well that's the problem when you're in a house 
[00:54:30]  with a lot of people you know there was it was kind of like the poseidon adventure my house we  wanted to go this way they wanted to go that way and it turned out my way was the good way let's stay  right the fuck where we are and have a hurricane party should have yeah should have and although and  that's what's great about twitter too there's a guy ecr news on twitter i want to thank him personally  on the show i now follow him just a local news guy i think down there he's giving me updates he's  like this is going to be nothing you should be fine i'll tell you exactly what's going to happen 
[00:55:00]  it's going to be heavy rain the wind's going to be whipping around a little bit but the houses will  be fine there will be no major flooding what i would highly recommend you you stay tight and then  a lot of other people on twitter saying the same shit that live in that area because they know  the outer banks but when you see on tv the outer banks is going to get hit by a hurricane  you think holy shit you personally going to be hit by a hurricane no hatteras was yeah hatteras was  way south of where we were we were pretty close to the virginia border we were a mile away from the 
[00:55:30]  virginia border you didn't have to leave we did not have to fucking leave in the end there was a  mandatory evacuation but even the fucking locals said mandatory evacuation doesn't mean shit hide your  car turn your lights off and have a hurricane party and let people think because that's what they do  evacuated because they do check to make sure everyone's out but they're like a car just behind  the house that you know let these guys don't want to fucking you know check that hard they drive by  the houses and see if there's lights on or or a car in front so they're like just hide your car you'll 
[00:56:00]  be fine but no we we all uh we lost you don't want to do that because what if the what if the news is  right and my brother there's a problem and then they drive by they go oh he checked everybody's gone and  then you have no electricity to call you're fucking in deep shit that's fun they said you might lose  the lights i don't care i'm in a beach house who gives a fuck you know that literally hours after  the hurricane passed it was one of the nicest fucking beach days ever ever so i would have driven 
[00:56:30]  a few miles to a nice hotel the closest hotel yeah i mean the hotel was nice but it's frustrating  when you know you're you got a beach house for two weeks you came back the next day oh yeah right away  like right away i'm like let's get the fuck back and then they had a height when they realized that  it didn't hit you you guys they had a hype the whole northeast thing and long island and new york  city could be in the path right i landed from los angeles when this thing was supposed to be at its peak  right and not even a rough landing right it was nothing right but getting back to the al roker thing 
[00:57:00]  thank you uh jimmy for pointing it out you're watching aren't you that's why they do what they do  they want to get a lot more viewers than they usually have and the problem is al you wrecked a  lot of people's vacations because they had to leave early they had to leave early and they got  money down and all this and a lot of people don't get hurricane insurance we happen to get it so  we'll be fine because you know that area does get hit with some shit but people had to leave early  al because you're fucking fear-mongering that's that's the problem i have with you you asshole 
[00:57:30]  everyone knew that this thing was gonna maybe scrape hatteras and it was gonna was gonna do  nothing to where we were at but all the people up and down the outer banks they left early i saw it  on twitter a bunch of people saying fuck man i lost three days of my vacation because this dumb  hurricane earl and the sad part is i'm trying to remember but i think it was friday morning it was  beautiful down there and all these people were already back in their house it couldn't have been  more appropriately named for what it no shit no really a lot of fucking noise a lot of noise a 
[00:58:00]  lot of noise no results a lot of spit yeah but there's al in the wind blowing around with the  fucking uh weather channel girl trying to make it into something that it wasn't and they always wear  loose fitting like trench coats so they they flap yeah you're right yeah yeah yeah they gotta have  a full sound it was just his stomach skin that's so i think of that what do you think of that fat 
[00:58:30]  head his bat wings under his arms i think this is how bad the hurricane was he's he he's uh he has to  like comment on what i'm tweeting on his twitter i'm like don't you have a fucking hurricane  he was angry he was angry it's very easy to get to al roker now very very he's a he's a clown  he's a al roker is a clown al's a fat turd he's a fucking clown whenever i think of al i think of a  big duty with a hat and bad weather advice duty but all the locals down there like just stay put 
[00:59:00]  and and sure enough when we were driving back you saw all the locals waving like assholes you  you left we stayed we knew the news and weather guys don't know we know we live down here right  you have a nice drive for no reason a few people were laughing going ah you fell for it sucks but  that's really it for the hurricane or all story i guess girl because there was nothing yeah there's  a there's a route 12 that a lot of people know down there there's a little flooding you got your 
[00:59:30]  fucking four by four vehicle you go through a few puddles we rode on the beach back to our house  with high tide way the fuck up but that was kind of cool to me yeah we didn't get stuck or nothing  you know dummies that would suck and my brother he just knows how to do weather he's studying the  maps he goes this is exactly what's going to happen weather is real easy to do you got to be  dramatic like that guy in a perfect storm and if these converge it's right oh my god right 
[01:00:00]  but he think that happens he nailed this fucking thing though yeah nailed it i never know how to look  what i'm watching on the news and then the weather map just keeps resetting i fucking hate the moving  weather map you don't like that right there like right you're showing a turn and it stops and goes  back it's like what's happening is it is it is it fucking gobbling up the fucking turf or is it just  stutter stepping it's the fucking big a of weather it's doing exactly what you're talking about you're  back into the left back into the left so for the most part see look at all these hurricanes 
[01:00:30]  hurricane igor they got a bunch of them uh doing sort of the earl thing what happens is  they all make that drastic right turn earl got a little too close absolutely but they they knew that  it might just scrape it wasn't coming inland because these hurricanes traditionally do not  do that but al didn't feel like telling anyone that no why would you you get people turning the  channel right al need them hanging in very scary you better oh 
[01:01:00]  you better tune in yeah i don't get it  let's eat let's eat let's do some meat hey if they named it after a boy they should have called it a  emicane so ready for a break so ready for a break hit that break  send this out to sal that is a good one it's a good pickup right there nice little 
[01:01:30]  song to commemorate the vaseline the time we needed the vaseline  can i address something really fast 
[01:02:00]  because you got assholes that uh think they know us think they know our situation  and then you you tweet fucking you tweet stuff that is the god's honest truth and then they have  to look into the tweets it's simple as this our contract ends october 1st and we'll see what  happens yeah after october 1st that's a situation we're in people people are talking our agent is 
[01:02:30]  talking to these guys yes but we're we're a bit uh we're a bit far away still we're just uh okay so it's  not a fucking bid or any of that shit our contract ends october 1st everyone as we sit here everyone  will think everything's a bit yeah like not everyone but some people you'll always get people i think  anything that goes on is a bit like if the show doesn't resign like november 11th they'll still be  going they're coming back it's a bit right like the east side dave thing it's such a bit i know 
[01:03:00]  you guys always do that enough already though you know i mean and we're we're really not even  being unreasonable that's you know that's that's as much as i'll say today we're not being  unreasonable but they got to kind of wake up a little bit down the hall they really do and the  fact that i personally am demanding my photo in that lobby i think is justifiable that's all you  want all i want that's all that's all jimmy wants is this photo in the lobby point yes it has  to be twice the size of the other photos and the other thing null's office i want a picture of me 
[01:03:30]  hanging oh we're hanging by the neck maybe they like that one well and the other thing we got to  address uh yeah steve is no longer with us yes after 10 or 11 years man yeah i remember the day he  sent in a demo tape to to to me yes it was pendulum and then we hired him to do some just basic shit and  then uh you know over the years he moved way the fuck up in the organization and and serious xm has 
[01:04:00]  decided to eliminate his position yes the hands and knees one what position it makes me sad to even do  that i can't even i can't even enjoy doing steve voice why why eliminate his position when that means  we have to eliminate all that material because now it's just sad to do i know i can't even feel good  doing that i think we just lost 20 of our show i know i always i loved the yes now it's just gonna  come out all like yeah yeah no no who the fuck hired this creep is he our new intern yeah i think

That one's rocking.  It is rocking.  Double time that one.  So what do they do for iTunes?  It's iTunes.  And then what, you put in Foundry?  Amazon or Rhapsody.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure if you can find Foundry, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y.  Four songs.  But that really fucking sounds good, man.  I like it, but you best get out of my way.  Got to sample one. 
[01:13:30]  They ought to just sample one and put them in there.  They got rid of that part of it.  So Steve, what does Steve have to do with this?  Is he doing anything musically with this?  Or is it just his songs?  He's now like a writer.  That's it?  Yeah.  He just passed his work on to somebody else.  Maybe someday we'll hear his music on a cat-like commercial.  Enough about Steve.  Not right enough.  Get on the fucking line and get your unemployment.  We've got a radio show to do.  Oh, shit. 
[01:14:00]  Way down in the rain with the rest of the sad fucks.  Just another one on the unemployment line.  Fuck.  Unemployment.  They're saying, what, 15% in the country?  Nah, it's just good.  The poverty level.  That means that number is higher, by the way.  Poverty levels at an all-time high, yeah.  15%?  Since like the 60s.  70s.  Whatever.  I'll just fucking.  It might have been 60s. 
[01:14:30]  LBJ.  60s, right?  LBJ.  Right?  It was the LBJ days.  Lyndon Baines.  Yeah.  We'll see what happens in November.  Democrats are starting to go like, hey, we didn't say that.  Hey, we're not for that.  Oh, Obama who?  I think they see it's time to start separating themselves from the administration.  You heard Phil Davidson by now, right?  Phil Davidson.  Phil Davidson fucking rules. 
[01:15:00]  He cut the promo trying to get nominated for treasurer in a county in Ohio.  Oh, God.  That's the video?  I saw a minute of it.  This guy fucking rules talking about politics.  This guy lost his fucking...  He basically did a wrestling promo.  Did he?  A wrestling promo.  This thing is everywhere.  I mean everywhere.  He looks like a lunatic.  Yeah, I got the highlights here because it is a little long.  But check out Phil Davidson.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Starr County Republican Party Executive Committee, good evening. 
[01:15:30]  And thank you not only for your attendance...  Brother.  ...but for allowing me the opportunity to speak.  These people watching?  My name is Phil Davidson.  And I am seeking our party's nomination for the position of Starr County Treasurer on November 10th.  Does he break through a wall and fall down?  November of 2010.  Excuse me.  In terms of my background, I am from the village of Minerva, where I am serving my 13th year of elected service as a Minerva Council member. 
[01:16:00]  And I got two radio shows.  In terms of education, I have a bachelor's degree in sociology, a bachelor's degree in history, a master's degree in public administration,  in a master's degree in communication, in terms of communications, in terms of elections across Starr County, I have represented our party twice on the county ballot. 
[01:16:30]  In both the primary and the general elections, when I ran for Starr County Clerk of Courts in 1996, and Starr County Commissioner in 2000, and I will not apologize for my tone tonight.  For his what?  His tone.  Oh.  This is my toad.  I know.  It sounded like it was toads and ice.  That was just a warm-up.  And then he really amps it up big time.  What a fucking fool.  Yeah, he's got a podium, and he didn't really... 
[01:17:00]  He's pacing.  He's pacing.  He didn't really memorize his speech.  He has to keep going back to the podium to see what his next line is.  What was I going to say?  It's amazing how there's a fine line between impassioned speaker and blithering idiot.  A lunatic.  Right.  I have been a Republican in times good.  Okay.  In times good.  Oh, no.  When people start reversing the order of words to sound poignant.  Yes, like Yoda.  And he messes up his own quote coming up here, too. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  I have been a Republican in times good, and I have been a Republican in times bad.  He's got to go back to his...  Albert Einstein issued one of my most favorite quotes in the history of the spoken word, and  it is as follows.  In the middle of opportunity...  Excuse me.  In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. 
[01:18:00]  I'm going to repeat that so I have clarity tonight.  In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.  This is the opportunity we've been waiting for.  The Stark County Treasurer's Office is a mess.  It is in dire need of structure and guidance.  And now is the time to seize this opportunity with an aggressive campaign and an even more aggressive  campaigner. 
[01:18:30]  If nominated tonight, I promise each and every person in this room, I will hit the ground running,  come out swinging, and end up winning.  I thought this was Bob during negotiations.  Wow.  What is wrong with him?  Why would you do this?  No.  He wants the gig.  And then he ends up... 
[01:19:00]  He ends real strong here.  Oh, he does?  Knowledge is power.  Let's step into this knowledge and use it as a tool to win the Treasurer's Office.  Let's use this knowledge not only as a tool, but as a weapon.  We must win this election.  If nominated tonight, I will win this election.  And I'm going to say that again so there's no miscommunication tonight.  If nominated tonight, I win.  Tell your friends.  Tell your neighbors. 
[01:19:30]  Tell Randy Gonzalez.  I'm coming.  Both barrels, guns loaded.  I believe in the entities and the principles of the National Republican Party, the State  of Ohio Republican Party, and the Stark County Republican Party.  And if nominated, I will not hide those beliefs on my march to victory on Election Day.  If nominated tonight, I can guarantee with 100% certainty that what you are seeing from  me tonight is what everyone outside those doors is going to get over the next eight weeks. 
[01:20:00]  I used to be an idealistic thinker.  I am now a pragmatic thinker.  Government may be about service.  Politics is about winning.  Oh, my God, King.  You hear that?  Phil Davidson's all revved up for WrestleMania.  You know what?  Chris nailed it on Instant Feedback.  Chris C in Virginia.  And I live in a van down by the river.  Got a little Farley in him, right?  Woo!  Wow. 
[01:20:30]  So, he's a little too revved up.  Yeah.  That is someone you watch and go, that's a crazy person.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Who's he running against?  I don't know.  It's all a joke.  And it sounds like some kind of, like, shitty office.  Like, who gives a shit office?  He's treasurer.  Treasurer of fucking Stark County?  What does that mean?  Gives a shit.  Make sure the politicians keep their Starbucks bill down or something.  Keep the fucking parking meter money coming in.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:21:00]  I'm going to win.  Right.  Do we have the horse story?  Yes, we do.  Horse story?  Oh, there was a horse story?  Yeah, my brother-in-law just texted the story to me.  Actually, look at the poor horse.  Suffolk investigators.  I hope that's the horse.  Searching for suspects that sexually abused a horse.  They can't show the entire horse's face.  Yeah.  Victim.  That fucking martling joke.  Horse walks into a bar.  The bartender goes, why the long face?  He says, I have cancer. 
[01:21:30]  Fucking martling.  That was a good one.  I added a line to that, too.  Oh, you did ya?  And then he goes to the bartender, I just, yeah, I better have a drink before I die today  or something.  Oh, Jim, good tag.  Hey, you.  Fucking, Jackie's like a friend of the show.  What world are we living in?  How did that happen, eh?  He had some great jokes, man.  I was thinking of that fucking cancer joke, actually.  What a funny line that was. 
[01:22:00]  It's great.  It's so despicable.  He's great, man.  He's quickly becoming a regular on the show.  Especially since the horse actually walked into a bar and answered the question.  Yeah.  And there's a real reason.  He shouldn't be in the bar.  Why is he in a barn?  He's taking care of himself.  Happy oats.  Yes.  Is there a news report on this, or we got to do some of that dumb reading?  Reading.  I don't want to fucking read today.  Oh, yeah.  I say we've...  I just like watching stuff on our radio show.  Makes it so much easier.  Everybody give me compliments on my windows.  Oh. 
[01:22:30]  And they'll walk past and say, your windows are beautiful.  I said, thank you.  I said, Wind World did it.  I left the town out there for a week.  Did you?  Window World.  Someone stole it.  This is like the best for less.  Who is this bitch?  It's tonight about an extreme case of animal abuse in Suffolk.  But we want to warn parents out there right now.  This will get you cocked hard.  So pull those fucking little cock walkers out of the room.  We pause this.  We're viciously violating a horse named Angel.  Going back to what Jimmy says a lot.  This isn't news. 
[01:23:00]  No.  Why are you putting this on your news and then you've got to warn the children and everything?  How about you just not do this story on your stupid news report?  They'll get the guy.  They don't want parents to have to sit there and discuss bestiality with their children.  You're putting parents in a bad situation.  They've got to sit little Johnny down and talk about how some men like horse cock up their  hineys.  And is there ever enough time to really explain to the child that he's got to leave the room  and why?  And they go, please have the children leave the room. 
[01:23:30]  Horse fucking.  Horse fucking.  Why not explain to the kids, Mama, why man put weenie and horse hiney?  Well, because sometimes the mother won't allow the husband to put the weenie and the hiney,  so he goes out to the barn and does it to the horse.  Explain to your kids.  You should have an open conversation about horse fucking with your children.  Mama, why woman put horse weenie in her?  Well, sometimes your father's, I mean, the woman might be not getting fucked properly. 
[01:24:00]  Yes.  She had an odd upbringing.  There was an uncle involved.  Go back to the politician, a lot of people coming up with the line, it's still real to  me, damn it.  Yeah, he sounded like him, too.  Yes.  Yelling idiot.  Yeah, did he go back a little bit?  Sweet.  All right, here we go.  Tonight investigators are searching for the person who viciously violated a horse named  Angel.  As New Channel 3's Jimmy Olobanji reports, the key question is, who would do such violent 
[01:24:30]  things, and could that person strike again?  Last night we told you the horrific story of this horse named Angel.  Angel's owner, Joy Jocko, came home on Labor Day to find her horse bleeding profusely.  When an emergency vet and police arrived to Joy's Suffolk home, they told her that someone  had sexually assaulted her horse, possibly with a blunt object like a baseball bat.  What does a person who would do this to a horse?  Dr. Louis Janda, a professor of psychology. 
[01:25:00]  Possibly with a baseball bat.  Police are either looking for a white man with a baseball bat or a nude black man.  Fucking baseball.  I'm out.  I thought this was a fun story.  This isn't fun.  It's hot.  I thought the guy was just hopping on board and getting a little.  Yeah.  Horse doesn't even know, continues eating its oats.  Baseball bat.  Can handle a man's penis, no problem.  But I don't think it can handle a fucking baseball bat.  Apparently not, rookie.  Of the shitter.  A rookie horse.  Fucking homophobic horse.  Yeah, there's no horse. 
[01:25:30]  Poor angel.  Just turn from fun to tragic.  ...at ODU says it's probably someone with dangerous tendencies.  You think?  Somebody who can harm an animal doesn't really have the sense of empathy that most of us have.  Pause that for a second.  Dr. Louis Janda really hit the nail on the head.  Somebody who fucks a horse in the ass with a baseball bat may have violent tendencies.  Either that or he just loves baseball, Doc.  You asshole.  Of course he does.  These dumb news experts always just stating the obvious. 
[01:26:00]  How about this?  Any person that rapes any creature with a stick used to hit a baseball has violent tendencies.  Problems.  You could be on the fucking news as an expert, Jimmy.  Sure could.  That should be your new character.  Expert Jimmy.  That's right.  Well, any man who uses a horse as asshole when he's supposed to be bunting probably has violent tendencies.  Right.  But you just throw it probably in there.  And you would be good.  This guy.  Reaches suffer.  So if they lack that empathy, they're likely to hurt other people as they get older. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  We could be talking about somebody who's walking around looking like you or me.  Oh, pause that.  Except for the fact they have a baseball bat with horse intestines hanging off the end of it.  Right.  They don't look like us there.  They look like you or me, meaning they walk on their hind legs.  But they have a bat over their shoulder, and it smells like shit.  And there are horse tears on the other end of it.  There's shit on one end, and horse tears.  Horse tears.  Big, salty, embarrassed horse tears. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, the poor guy.  What idiots these people are.  Of course he looks like you and me.  What do you think, it's a guy with eight legs?  It's not a giant centipede that raped a horse.  It's a guy.  Fucking idiot.  God bless you.  Oh, hey, Anthony, it's Angel.  You have any Vaseline?  Or a towel I could sit on?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Police are searching for a man named Wilbur. 
[01:27:30]  To someone who was capable of this type of act.  Dr. Darlene Coulson says the fact is, this horse abuser may be someone who functions quite well on the surface.  Except.  Except when he begins masturbating during certain scenes in The Godfather.  That's where he wouldn't be a normal person.  He thought Jack Waltz fucked that horse to death.  Changed his life.  He's stalking Sarah Jessica Parker.  He gets an erection whenever somebody says their throat is really, really sore. 
[01:28:00]  Horse.  Horse.  What is this dumbass saying?  He was not functioning well.  There's really just no way to say it.  Of course he's not functioning well.  He had to use a baseball bat and lobe his hard penis.  Both Dr. Janda and Dr. Coulson say even if this person is caught, this type of mental illness is hard to treat.  For people who lack empathy, attempts at treatment are fairly limited. 
[01:28:30]  If you just don't have that sense, it's hard to change someone so that they feel something.  How about speech impediments?  Can we fix that?  Yeah, thank you.  You fucking, you big-tongued zilch.  Lisping ass.  Horse asshole doctor.  Also, you hear the dog getting fucked in the background as he's talking?  You might want to check on your own dog.  That's not a winner in the fucking medical school fucking lottery. 
[01:29:00]  The guy that has to sell up the horse's asshole when it's bleeding and it's got fucking pieces of wood in it.  Splinters.  Yeah, splinters.  Little horse's rectum.  Oh, the horse angel.  Little angel.  Yeah.  Mental illness is hard to treat.  For people who lack empathy, attempts at treatment are very difficult.  Is this another prosper guy?  They feel something when they see people or animals suffer. 
[01:29:30]  Now, both doctors say they don't want to stereotype, but usually this type of offender is younger and sometimes adolescent males.  Some of the police say whoever did this was seen leaving the area.  How is that stereotyping?  Jesus, what a fucking politically correct idiot country.  It's a white guy with a fucking smelly bat.  That's who did it.  Fuck, I didn't know there was a bat involved.  I know.  It was probably the other handle.  It was like pine tar.  He didn't have any pine tar. 
[01:30:00]  The old George Prince.  You got shit on my baseball bat.  What's the guy's excuse going to be?  He was just warming up and the horse backed into him.  He was using the horse as a donut.  He was lying behind the horse.  The horse wouldn't move fast enough.  Come on, buddy.  Let's go.  That stuff happens.  He's just a javelin thrower with great aim. 
[01:30:30]  Could have been anything.  Maybe the horse dared him.  Or angel.  Why don't we take a break?  We got Mark Hoppus coming in.  And Amy Schumer in studio.  What's this about?  I didn't read any emails.  What's up?  I didn't read any emails.  I drove for 12 straight hours in the rain yesterday.  I'm a little behind.  Oh, a different spin?  Okay.  This is Amy Schumer's new show with Mark, right?  Yes.  And Mark's from Blink-182.  Yes.  Mark Hoppus and Amy Schumer promoting a different spin. 
[01:31:00]  Premieres this Thursday at 7 p.m. on Fuse.  And they're going to on the first...  What's the show about, Jimmy?  You know, it's a...  What is it?  Well, they deal a lot with horse rape.  And this whole thing was a publicity stunt by Amy and Mark.  Just to get people watching Fuse.  Focus on music news, fun panel discussions, and special reports from the show's correspondents.  The show will also feature musical performances by both mainstream and emerging bands. 
[01:31:30]  Ooh.  Hey, man.  Fucking hey.  Good for Amy Schumer, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She has a show on Fuse.  This Thursday at 7 p.m. the premiere with Mark Hoppus.  And we'll talk to them next.  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:32:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  And the crying that I knew is for you  Okay, Caggot, what's next? 
[01:32:30]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Ta-da! 
[01:33:00]  Do you get it?  Poor angel.  We got Sam in studio.  Wow, I don't even know what might...  This funny thing.  How long were we gone?  Did we take a whole season off?  Is it winter now?  Feels like it.  Sam's in studio because he's an aficionado  when it comes to wrestling.  And we started a little bit called the Wrestling  or the Wrestler Death Clock or whatever.  Dead Wrestler... 
[01:33:30]  What do we call it?  The Wrestler Death Clock.  The Wrestler Death Clock?  Okay.  And all we're trying to do on this show  is go 100 days without a dead wrestler.  I thought it was 90 days.  90 days?  90 days, 3 months, whatever.  We just want a week to go by.  But it's 90 days.  It was like a year ago at this point  when you guys said,  we just want to see 90 days go by 
[01:34:00]  without a wrestler dying.  How long have we been doing this bit?  It has to be about a year.  And we haven't gone 90 days?  We haven't come close.  We haven't come close.  This bit's really a year old?  I think so, yeah.  I thought we just started this.  I would have to go back and do a little research,  but I think it's about a year old.  Wow.  Coke Logic's writing another great edition  of Opie and Anthony Theater.  Yes.  Sound Clip Theater.  Ah.  All right, so it's been about a year.  Now, where were we? 
[01:34:30]  Because now I'm so confused by all these dead wrestlers.  I don't even know.  Well, when we last left...  When we last left you?  Lance Cade was the newest wrestler to die.  I think that had been like 20-something days.  And who was the guy before him?  I don't remember the guy before Lance...  I think maybe Trent Acid.  All right, so we'll go with Lance Cade.  Lance Cade, he was young and he died and he was in...  How young?  He was in his late 20s, early 30s.  Well, that's a nice life. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Well, that's a nice, healthy, long life.  But he was not with the company.  For a squirrel.  He wasn't with the company when he passed away.  Well, that's what makes Vince very happy.  Yeah, yeah.  That they're dying off property grounds.  That he just gets rid of them and they drop dead.  But so then...  So we reset that clock.  Right.  So now we're going to say, okay, now let's get to 90 days.  Right.  And we got to vacation without incident. 
[01:35:30]  But just about as soon as vacation started, 14 days after Lance Cade died, we lost Luna Vachon.  Luna?  Yes.  Now, what do we know about Luna Vachon?  About her life or about her death?  How old, first of all?  She was like the fabulous moolah?  No, she was the pioneers of lady wrestling?  No, it wasn't.  She was in that golden decade of pro wrestlers.  Ah.  She was in her 40s.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  I told you, the 40s is a very dangerous time. 
[01:36:00]  Where's a picture of Luna?  Let's get a picture of her so I can try to remember.  The fans used to chant, Luna Tick.  Luna Tick.  Oh, that's right.  Luna Tick.  Eee.  Heart don't tick.  Oh, wow.  No, dude.  Oh, I remember Luna.  Oh, yeah.  She kind of was doing the China thing.  Yeah.  She came out later in the WWE.  At first, she came out with like Bam Bam Bigelow.  But then, later on, you may remember her from her stint with the oddities.  Uh, no. 
[01:36:30]  Something tells me from looking at her that she might have done steroids.  Yeah.  Well, something's going on there, Sam.  She's got some wacky breast implants going.  I've often said that the wrestling-related deaths are normally not steroids, but the massive amount of pills.  Ah, right, right, right.  To control the pain from the bumps they take.  There was rumored to be, like, crushed up, I think, Vicodin, and a straw.  Oh, the straw does it every time.  Next to her lifeless body? 
[01:37:00]  Right.  Oh.  And apparently, I read somewhere that she was, that Andre the Giant was her godfather because she was in a wrestling family.  And her ashes were scattered over the grave of Andre.  Oh, that's kind of sick.  Yeah.  Until the leaf blower guy comes along.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not funny.  It sounds romantic until the guy has to clean up the shit on the grave sites.  It's the same guy that takes those flowers that you've picked out and knelt down by the grave and put them in and said a few words. 
[01:37:30]  And then the creep just comes and grabs him and throws him out.  Throws him in a dumpster.  Yeah.  He wants to keep everything tidy.  Tidy and neat.  The ghoul needs to keep everything tidy on the grave sites.  I'm coming for you, Barbara.  She has hair like Joe Dirt.  Yeah.  Really awful.  I thought she was related to somebody else, too, Sam.  Well, she was related to Butcher Vashon and Mad Dog Vashon.  Sure.  Part of the Vashon wrestling legacy.  Yes.  Are any of them dead?  Well, there are Vashons who are dead, but Butcher and Mad Dog, I think, are both still alive. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, thank God.  They're older.  So she died 14 days after the other guy.  Right.  And then I thought, okay, so that's it for vacation.  Right.  Now, this, I think, will not officially count on the wrestler clock, but very quickly after Luna,  A couple days, right?  an independent wrestler named J.C. Bailey passed away at the age of, I believe, 27.  27.  Now, this must have been a tragic car accident or something. 
[01:38:30]  How did you know him?  I didn't know him very well.  He was on the East Coast independent scene.  What type of accident befell him?  That's terrible.  That I don't even know, but I'm assuming it was, could have been, maybe the heart gave  out?  Oh!  Maybe something like that.  Oh, see, silly me.  I thought, perhaps, since he was so young, that it must have been a tragic accident.  But because he didn't make a, I don't think he made enough of an impact to make the wrestler 
[01:39:00]  death clock list.  Yeah.  Because he wasn't in any wrestling headlines before he died.  So we almost don't count him.  Well, I'd say we don't.  Okay.  Fine.  But.  Don't even have to.  Yeah, we don't because.  Not at this point.  We've got a lot of names in front of you.  What the fuck happened over vacation?  I'm just trying to keep track of everything.  All right.  Yeah.  Because, so Luna dies.  Right.  She reset the, uh, the, the, the death clock.  Because, uh.  The wrestler death clock.  15 days after the death of Luna Vachon was September 11th.  And, of course, September 11th will now always be remembered for the day that we lost, uh, 
[01:39:30]  Bastion Booger.  I don't know Bastion Booger.  That's going to be the, why we remember September 11th.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  So the wrestling.  Bastion Booger.  The wrestling death clock made it to 15 days after Luna before we lost Bastion Booger.  Now, what happened to Bastion Booger?  Well, he was, uh.  Oh, I remember that guy.  He was the Booger man.  Yeah.  He also wrestled as Friar Ferguson and Norman the Lunatic. 
[01:40:00]  So he had lots of.  A.K.A.  Yes.  He had a lot of A.K.A.'s.  I saw him at a convention not four months ago.  Oh, wow.  And he was actually doing photo ops with his Bastion Booger outfit on.  How did he look?  Um.  He was heavyset.  Uh.  You know, not great.  But he was never.  He shaved his eyebrows like little Hitler mustaches over his eyes.  Well, he wanted to look crazy.  Well, he certainly pulled it off. 
[01:40:30]  Well, looked.  How old was he?  Oh, that's him right there.  There he is.  Uh.  He.  Looks like a gym teacher there.  He died at the age of 53.  All right.  So he made it to old age.  He made it past the 40s.  Normally a safe time.  Not a bad record for this vicinity.  But yes, he made it to only, uh.  Quint.  Only 53.  53.  So we went Lance Cade.  Then we had 14 days.  Uh-huh.  Then Luna.  Uh-huh.  Then we had 15 days.  And now Bastion Booger.  And so now we're at two days. 
[01:41:00]  Two days.  Let's try to make it to 90.  Two days.  We gotta make it to 90.  We can make it to 90.  Someone said this started out as a bet that I started January.  Like early January.  So we're nine months into this.  Nine and a half months into this.  If we go 88 more days without a wrestler's death.  We can finally get rid of this stupid bit.  I think we can do it.  You think we can do it?  Oh, 88 days is nothing for wrestlers.  They'll hang in there.  That's a long time, man.  They die quickly.  Now what?  Our guests are here.  So we gotta finish up with Sam.  But really fast.  Hulk Hogan went to the hospital over break. 
[01:41:30]  He had back spasms.  So he's cool now?  He's fine, though.  He's not dead.  Okay.  Back spasms, brother.  He's not dead.  Not dead.  No.  Was it happening during one of the tapings of his Rent-A-Center commercials?  No, but he did have to miss his TNA dates because of his back spasms.  Back spasms.  He made a Twidio from the hospital to prove that he was in the hospital, on the hospital bed,  so he was missing his wrestling dates.  So it's part of a wrestling angle? 
[01:42:00]  I don't know.  But he's not dead.  And then Ant knows Jim the Anvil.  Jim the Anvil Nightheart.  You know him, right?  He's alive.  But he was arrested.  What happened?  I believe...  On paid parking tickets?  No.  It was either got to be domestic violence or a D-Week.  What about...  You got to go pills, too.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  These wrestlers love their pills.  In order to arrest somebody, though, they had to have gotten them on something first. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, I see.  They don't just search them and find pills.  Good point.  Good point.  What was the arrest?  I believe there were two charges.  One was drugs and the other, robbery.  Wow!  Jim the Anvil.  I didn't know you knew Jim the Anvil Nightheart.  Yes.  Now, Jim the Anvil is one that I'm very...  He's had a hell of a career.  What is he doing fucking robbing?  Well, I'm very worried about Jim the Anvil Nightheart because he was Bret Hart's tag team  partner for a while, and they did a convention together where they did a Q&A, and all the 
[01:43:00]  kids were asking Bret Hart questions because as the Q&A went on, Jim the Anvil Nightheart  was not maintaining consciousness.  Oh, wow.  He kept nodding off and putting sunglasses on to hide the fact that his eyes were shut.  He was asleep.  Yeah.  That would happen.  So, he may not...  The odds aren't in his favor right now.  Oh, boy.  So, you're thinking he might be next.  Hulk Hogan...  I mean, Jake the Snake is still around.  X-Pac is still around.  You never know.  Daryl says that Hulk Hogan hurt his back picking up seashells, according to ESPN. 
[01:43:30]  So...  I mean, maybe.  He loves the beach.  Or maybe picking up the change that his wife left.  Oh, wow.  Let's see, because...  Wow.  Hey, Amy, thanks, Sam.  Get the fuck out of here.  Amy Schumer and Mark Hoppus are outside the studio.  Yes.  Let's bring him in, man.  Let's talk about this new show they got going on.  A different spin.  Yay.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, Mark.  How are you, brother?  Good.  How are you?  Good, man.  Amy, what's up?  Hi. 
[01:44:00]  Sit next to Jimmy, Amy.  That way, I can look at you.  Oh, good.  Oh, boy.  Oh, good.  Good morning.  How are you?  Hi.  Are you wearing a bra?  A little bit.  Oh, one of those, like...  A little bit.  It's a strapless.  They're kind of useless.  Yeah, they just kind of...  They just kind of cover your nipples.  What are you for?  Yeah.  I'm Jewish, so it's a situation.  Hey.  Morning, Mark.  We're learning about each other.  Why did you drag me in here?  I told him.  Why did you drag me in here with these little texts?  I was trying to understand what the nipple thing was all about. 
[01:44:30]  You're Jewish, so you have an issue?  I don't understand.  Jewish girls have big nipples.  Oh, they do?  Yeah.  They also have, like...  You've never heard of a Jewish girl?  Yeah, I have.  Oh, all right.  Well, you should have, like, looked at her boobs.  Wait.  I skip right over that and go...  Nah.  You put them face...  Fucking face first in the pillow.  That's right.  That's what you get for doing that to Christ.  I've never read about that in Anne Frank's diary.  And I have big nipples.  Should have read the epilogue. 
[01:45:00]  Schindler's tits.  Let's keep going.  Wow.  Hey, somebody had a vacation.  Oh, hey.  We're wide awake.  This is different than last time.  No kidding.  It's good to be rested.  Yeah.  Some Jewish girls have non-existent nipples.  Really?  I mean, they're there, but they blend in with everything else, too.  Oh, they're, like, translucent?  Oh, the big fade.  Yes, that was my experience with a Jewish broad on Long Island.  Oh, wow.  Big ones, but you couldn't tell where the nipples start and the rest of the...  And what's the point?  It was weird, man. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, that's a weird fade.  That's upsetting.  I never knew that about Jewish...  I never knew, ethnically, that nipples had anything to do with it.  That's fucking great.  That's true.  I'm here to teach you about nipples.  Yeah, screw the show.  Let's talk about nipples.  Right, right.  What do you guys do on the show?  You interview bands?  We do.  We interview bands.  There's live performances.  We have field pieces.  And we talk about current musical topics.  Anything and everything having to do with music will kind of work into the show.  Basically, what MTV would have done if they had not been just doing all these fucking weird shows. 
[01:46:00]  Right, right.  If it hadn't just become an examination of, like, the saddest form of life.  Yeah.  What MTV is doing.  Yeah.  But it's fun, because they don't want us to be these cookie-cutter, you know, just,  we love every video.  Katy Perry, number five.  It's not like that.  We can be honest and have fun and really share our opinions.  Yeah, they had the VMAs last night, but they don't play videos anymore, so I'm really  confused.  Right.  It doesn't make any sense.  No, it doesn't make any sense at all.  Do you guys talk about Lady Gaga?  Uh, yeah, he comes up. 
[01:46:30]  For sure.  We can't avoid it.  Yeah, we do, actually.  We were doing test episodes the other day, and we were talking about how Lady Gaga did  a cover just in meat.  Yeah, well, she's trying to be outrageous.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  She's crazy.  Watch out for Lady Gaga.  She's crazy.  She's wearing meat.  A meat suit.  What's she saying, man?  What was the point of it?  Yeah, what was the point of it?  I don't know.  They're saying she's trying to parody herself.  I think it's, uh, that humans are wasteful.  I heard she was covering up her big Jew nipples with a couple of sirloins. 
[01:47:00]  She wishes.  That's true.  She's a gay.  Uh, is she?  Yeah.  No, you know the way I realized that I had big nipples was me and, uh, the rest of the  girls in my grade.  We were, like, 13.  And they would hang their coats on yours?  I'd pull their book bags.  The teachers would squeeze your attention to their coffee?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Jeez.  I'm sorry.  When he's awake.  Wow.  Yeah, he's dangerous when he's awake.  No.  You're very, very different than you are on The Tonight Show. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  I should have been close.  Oh, a bit of a potty mouth off the show.  Yeah, we get this version.  He gets away with the bare minimum.  I want to hear the 13-year-old story.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Everybody get your dicks out.  Get it.  So, uh, that's it?  Um, so, yeah, the guys convinced us that we were all going to flash them.  So, we're all, like, lined up.  Me and the other girls were 13.  We drank for the first time.  What little whores?  Oh, yeah.  That was just the beginning.  That was just the beginning.  Which one of your parents' great friends was this? 
[01:48:00]  No, it was.  It was.  It was our favorite substitute teacher.  And so, we all, like, lift up our shirts.  And, uh, and everyone looks at me.  And I'm like, why are they looking at me?  And it was because all the other girls just flashed their bras.  But I was like, boom.  I was like, I thought we were doing the whole nine yards here.  But, no.  And that's how you found out you had big nipples?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody just said that.  Everyone talked about it?  But, you know, I was a little, like, I had no idea.  I thought everybody's bodies were kind of the same.  And they were like, no, you, like, those look like. 
[01:48:30]  You mean big by, like, long?  Or do you mean, like, big areola?  Big areola.  Oh, okay.  That's sexy.  Big areola is sexy.  The nipple, though.  Oh, it's not?  The nipple is not the nipple.  The nipple is the nipple.  Well, that's like, oh, yeah.  But do you have a nice fade going on?  It's all the pisan, though.  Oh, my, I've got gray tits.  So it's a nice fade.  Yeah.  If we relive that moment, we'll get erocked in here.  Laying down, standing up.  They're always consistent.  Are they dark or are they light?  Medium.  Okay.  That's good.  Medium.  Why are we talking about this?  That's great.  Areola are part of the nipple, too.  They are?  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  It is.  What?  Areola is part of the nipple.  It's the whole thing you look at.  Well, I mean, yeah, if you want to split hairs.  I can say it like the brake pad and the drum.  They're both brakes.  That's true.  So it's like, it's one piece.  Yeah, but then so is the actual breast, and then so is the chest.  It's like, where do you stop?  It's a slippery slope.  Stop at the shoulder blade all the way around the back.  It's all one giant five-foot-nine place to put cum.  Oh, my dad's nickname. 
[01:49:30]  Weird.  You made me miss him.  But when you think nipples, you think the whole...  Yeah, yeah, of course.  The whole enchilada.  Yeah.  Well, that's kind of cool.  It's just what the size of mine is.  That's sexy.  That's like, you know...  You should talk about your nipples on this show.  Yeah?  You'll get people watched.  Tonight, on a very special edition.  A different nipple.  With Mark Hoppus.  That's great.  So who do you have coming on?  Way to take the sexy out of it.  No talent.  Join Fitz.  I ask a real question.  Well, the show starts Thursday. 
[01:50:00]  Thursday night.  On Fuse, by the way.  On Fuse TV.  On Fuse.  Yeah, 7 o'clock.  And, you know, John Mayer.  You might have heard of him.  John Mayer.  He used to do our show.  He's called in, but he's probably got real famous.  Yeah, he's been on tour.  He's been touring for like a year.  Yeah.  We got John Mayer.  We got Neon Trees.  On the second episode, we have Lincoln Park and The National.  We got some big names.  What happened to Lincoln Park?  They're coming back.  They played the VMAs last night.  They look like giant gods of rock.  Did you see it?  No. 
[01:50:30]  I was too tired.  It was amazing.  The show was held in L.A.  And Lincoln Park played at the Griffith Observatory out in front where they have the big obelisk.  And it was all lit, all weird and cool.  And yeah, I aspire to be them.  They went away for a while.  Did you ask them about that?  I'm going to.  Well, we haven't taped their show yet.  I don't ask them about that.  They went away.  I don't know if they meant to do that.  The music kind of changed a little bit.  You think that's what happened with those guys?  Yeah, they kind of regrouped.  They were fucking huge.  Did they perform?  I saw the beginning of the VMAs. 
[01:51:00]  I thought Chelsea was funny.  I just saw her opening, but she was fucking hilarious.  Chelsea Hamlin?  Yeah, she's fucking hilarious.  That was funny with their headpiece coming in.  Yeah, it was very funny.  And then I saw Justin Bieber, you know, wipe off my stomach.  You see him looking like a tough guy?  Is he actually tough?  I don't know.  I don't know if he's tough.  Wasn't he getting thrown around like he was at a beach party or something like that?  Was that the clip that I saw?  No, he was on stage.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's right.  Was he?  Yeah.  It was during his performance.  They started just throwing him around. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, a bunch of people threw him around.  I don't know what else to do with this kid.  He's 13 or whatever.  I don't get it on any level, but he's not for us.  He's too old.  Yeah, he's getting too old now for the little girls.  I think he is.  My chick never really watched him, and she was watching him.  It was just great to watch a woman hate him so much.  Really?  She would hate him.  Yeah, she really does.  What's her problem with him?  She's like, I don't know why I fucking hate his guts, but I just do.  He's very hateable.  He really is. 
[01:52:00]  And that's odd for your girl because he's white.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  By the way, incidentally, the best part of the fucking thievery incident at Anthony's  house was apparently this guy's girlfriend was of an ethnic origin and just trying to  fucking goad my girlfriend into saying racist shit, which was really easy.  She's the best.  She's like, twist my arm.  She's already screaming racial slurs.  She couldn't stop.  She is fantastic when it comes to racist talk.  Oh, boy.  Oh, we have these long conversations. 
[01:52:30]  It's fantastic.  It's like fucking Anthony with tits.  What a dream.  So, yeah, it's fucking, it's cool, man.  I'm happy to see Amy.  I don't know.  We don't know each other, Mark, but I'm happy to see Amy getting a fucking TV gig.  Yeah, it's great.  A job.  It's about time for Amy.  I have an ID badge.  I can get in that building whenever I want.  Really?  I've never had one of those.  Yeah, they take that away pretty fast.  Yeah, I bet.  I'm enjoying it all.  Yeah, that Viacom badge or whatever it is.  That goes away.  Another one goes away.  When they replace you with somebody who's like, you know, a little bit less abrasive on them. 
[01:53:00]  They all start complaining.  We like him, but she's just fucking nasty to everybody.  That's true.  No, it's true.  That's how I introduce myself, is the easily replaceable co-host.  What did you do?  You did something very, Amy is fucking really funny.  And what kind of a meeting did you have with the executives?  You were telling us.  Oh, and Mark and I hadn't been into Fuse for a couple weeks.  And they know me, but they don't know me that well.  So I text Mark in the morning, because I have a pregnancy suit from a fake belly that's from a photo shoot. 
[01:53:30]  And I was like, should I wear this into the office and just really fuck with all the executives?  And he was like, yes.  So I come in, and it just looks like I'm fully pregnant.  Ready to pop.  Not ready to pop, just at that point where if you saw her, you'd be like, I don't know if I should say congratulations, or I might be insulting you, calling you fat.  Yeah, just on the border.  Just that perfect amount where you think that she might be pregnant, but you're like, I don't want to get my ass kicked in case I'm wrong.  So I walk in, we had a huge meeting with all the executives. 
[01:54:00]  And I said, hi, Iraq.  Yeah.  Hi, Iraq.  I walk in, and they're just like, nobody says anything, but they're all just kind of looking at me and then looking at each other.  And later they showed me the text messages, just being like, she's fucking pregnant.  What are we going to do?  You know, like their new co-hosts, it's a situation.  They didn't want to make a thing of it, though, to your face, right?  No, nobody would say anything.  Were you acting pregnant, or were you not acknowledged?  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't.  Mark was totally, like, hamming it up to me.  He's like, do you want anything?  Are you nauseous yet? 
[01:54:30]  You want a glass of water?  Are you all right?  How do you feel?  Yeah.  Do you want the number of a clinic?  And I'm sitting down.  Those executives are taking their coats off the hangers.  Here you are, man.  That's right.  That's right.  They were so relieved, but they kind of pissed at me.  They were kind of pissed.  That's fucking funny, man.  How can they be pissed?  It's not even being taped.  It's just to annoy the people who are paying you.  Just scaring people who gave me a job.  That'll learn them.  Good for you.  Fucking awesome.  Thank you.  God damn, wearing that off-the-shoulder thing.  That t-shirt on.  Because then it's like, I could picture how you look kind of naked. 
[01:55:00]  It's great, right?  That's kind of good.  Yeah, it is.  It's a good look.  Like, I like when girls wear things like that, where the shit is just cut open.  Like, the t-shirt neck is cut open ridiculous.  So it goes down on, like, your bicep from your neck.  And you kind of can put the pieces together now.  Oh, here comes the camera phone.  You always see the most unflattering pictures of all time.  Someone's like, she looks like Nixon last time.  I was like, Pat Nixon, though.  At least it wasn't Richard.  The last picture I took did very well.  It did? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  We just can't do a side.  Pat had a big nipple.  Let's not do a side profile.  Let's find my better angle.  Here, I'll pull my pants down a bit.  Oh, Nancy.  Pull his pants down a bit later.  A few years later.  It sucks because there's nothing for dudes.  There's no parallel for dudes.  Like, a guy can't hang half a ball.  No, no, no.  Nobody wants that.  And then the girls would be like, I can picture what both of your balls would look like.  It's fantastic.  I turned the lights off so she looks better.  Oh, my God.  You're terrible.  Give me a pose for the tweeter.  That's a good...  The tweeter.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, now it's all blurry. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Yeah, we do this all the time.  Yeah, hang on.  Just take a picture.  We're going to take a picture.  It's dead air.  Everybody knows that everyone's just J-O-ing.  Are we supposed to do good radio?  No.  I thought we were just supposed to do radio.  What do we do?  Just be here.  Yeah, just show up.  Whatever.  I don't like that picture.  We're going to redo it.  How much...  Guys!  I'm going for the delete.  How much attention is Ozzy Osbourne going to get on your show?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, a good amount.  Oh, good.  Yeah, lots.  Yeah, totally.  A whole lot.  Fuse as a network is a total Ozzy fan. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, good.  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah.  It's weird because you walk through one time and they always have whatever's on the channel  up throughout the studios and you'll look up one time and it's like Justin Timberlake  and then you look up sometime and it's Ozzy Osbourne.  You look up another time and they play all different kinds of music, which is really cool.  Yeah.  It's not just up for them.  I like them as a network.  They're not shitty.  Yeah, absolutely.  You should come on.  Yeah, you should come on.  How do you guys do bands?  It's not like a band.  We do panels and we talk about music.  We do panels.  We talk about stuff. 
[01:57:00]  We talk about music.  I just want to know how awkward is this when I start emailing Amy after the segment's  over and she's like, yeah, we're going to pitch it to the producers.  They like you, but they're like, you know, not right now.  Yeah.  You're just not where they want you to be.  Show off the ground.  Give us some time.  Start bringing him on.  We have Bill Burr booked.  Yeah.  We just have a different demo.  Oh, my God.  She's ready.  Ozzy's coming around, by the way, in December.  You should try to get him on to help promote.  I'm going to keep plugging for Ozzy.  We should. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, of course.  We're going to.  Yeah.  I like that new video.  Yeah.  I haven't seen it.  Oh, it's really cool.  It's cool.  Jack, his son did that.  Oh, really?  It's for Life Won't Wait, which is a fucking great song on screen, but I haven't seen the  video.  His son directed it?  Jack directed it?  I think he did, yeah.  Oh, rad.  Wow.  It's really good?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's a cool song.  I really like the hook in it.  I like the chorus a lot.  And I'm not normally necessarily a huge fan.  Boo!  I have a lot of respect for him.  I'm just being straight.  I have immense respect for the man.  And I didn't expect to like new stuff from him after all these years. 
[01:58:00]  I didn't think a new song.  I was like, oh, great.  Another Ozzy Osbourne song.  But it turned out to be awesome.  Yeah.  It was great.  That's kind of a compliment.  It is, yeah.  A guy who was never a huge fan liked the new stuff.  That's good.  I didn't say I was never a huge fan.  I just...  You know, a guy that hates Ozzy.  A guy that thinks Ozzy equals cancer apparently likes a new song.  Good for him.  Another show on Fuse is the Top 20 Countdown.  And one of the hosts on that is a huge Ozzy fan.  Really?  She's like obsessed with Ozzy.  Is she?  Yeah.  All right.  Mistress Julia. 
[01:58:30]  You'd like her.  Is she attractive?  Oh.  She's beautiful.  Oh, good.  Wow, look at that.  Maybe I'll show her one of my many Ozzy photos.  Yeah.  Or he'd probably rather fuck her.  Amazing how fast I could lose.  But she had big nipples, though.  I haven't seen yet, but I'm predicting yes.  She's a big Ozzy fan?  Yes, she's a big Ozzy fan.  And when I was in Los Angeles, and I'm hanging out with a lovely young lady, and she has an  old school record player, like one of those sarcophagus-sized things that used to be in  your parents' house.  In the parlor. 
[01:59:00]  Lifts the top up, puts the fucking album on.  It's Blue Oyster Cult, Agent of Fortune.  I'm like, this is so fucking cool.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm like, how the hell does a 12-year-old know this album?  What's the big song off that album?  Oh, God.  There's a bunch of them on that fucking thing.  It's like some of the...  But it's not a lot of the well-known ones.  Okay.  Like, I like going a little deep with my BOC.  I don't know what the hit was.  I mean, if it's not Don't Fear the Reaper, then it's a deep cut, right? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, then it's a deep cut.  Exactly.  Reaper or deep cut.  Godzilla.  It's like astronomy and fucking flaming telepaths and VTI and shit like that.  You guys watched the VMAs last night?  I didn't watch the VMAs, but I watched a bunch of...  Some of it?  Yeah, some of it.  I watched some of it.  Did you see what Cher did?  I didn't see what she did.  Was that really Cher?  I thought that was like her wax.  Did she introduce her daughter as Chris Penn?  What did Cher do?  She surprised the audience. 
[02:00:00]  She came out in that leather jacket and the fishnet fucking outfit.  What, from her old video?  The one where she rides on the battleship?  Yeah, yeah.  The awkward one where she's naked in front of her young son who was playing the guitar.  I did see her in that outfit, but I thought that was just standard issue.  I didn't think it was a big thing for her to walk around like that.  I thought that was, you know...  That's a big deal considering it's...  She's 60, 25 years later or whatever.  How'd she look?  Yeah.  But she's still fucking attractive.  I mean, who would...  She's American Indian and she has giant genitals. 
[02:00:30]  Who wouldn't fucking say that?  Is that known?  Oh, yeah, of course it is.  Imagine half Jew, half Indian.  Giant nipples.  Big vagina.  High cheekbones.  I love how Amy just turned to Mark and goes,  Jim likes giant genitals.  She's got to explain this stuff to Mark.  Yeah, you know.  It's kind of a getting to know you.  It's not a clit unless it's the size of an apple.  That's right.  That's what he always says.  I want it to look like it was Photoshopped, my God. 
[02:01:00]  Jim likes clits that are dangerously big, Mark.  Everlasting gobstoppers.  I like how, because Amy's been here so much,  she's like, you know, trying to play the good host.  He loves big genitalia.  That's like the information I slip in.  Just trying to spoon feed you the stuff.  Amy's an inside joke.  Amy's in panic mode.  Yeah, no, and I haven't been here that much.  This is information they give you right away.  Yeah, right.  This is the talking point sheet.  Here's what they're going to talk to you about.  Giant genitalia.  Jewish nipples. 
[02:01:30]  That's it.  I have learned nothing about this new show.  Yeah, well, it's mostly interviews and talking about music.  I mean, it's kind of like a, it's probably like I'm more of a hang.  You guys show videos?  We don't show videos.  What are you talking about?  We show videos of the, we have live performances on the show.  Like the National is going to come on and perform this week.  And Neon Trees is taping today.  How long the show is it?  An hour.  Once a week.  Yeah, every Thursday for an hour.  Wow.  Now, do you have to do like research and stuff?  Do you know anything about like music? 
[02:02:00]  Amy doesn't know shit about it.  No, not a thing.  Are you going to research them or is that part of the thing where you're just going to talk to wing it?  I know about the music I know about.  I'm a huge music fan, but I don't know.  I was looking at like the top 10 billboards, like songs of the summer.  And half of them I had no idea.  No idea.  It was like these like kind of clubby hip hop.  Because in New York, we don't, I don't drive.  I just listen to my iPod.  So I don't hear what's on the radio.  I don't hear what, you know, the music.  Yeah, I'm on the radio every day.  Her own channel too.  So anytime you're in your car, you can hear us. 
[02:02:30]  I know, but that's when I want me time.  That's when I need me time.  What was the big summer song?  You know, every year there's a summer song.  California Girls.  You think it was Katy Perry?  What is that song?  As a matter of fact, this is something that we had to research because I guess we're talking  about it on one of the first shows.  Oh, really?  And I was the same way.  I was like, I don't know half these songs.  I had to research them.  I'm ridiculous right now into fucking CeeLo Green.  Fuck you.  Oh, yeah.  That's a great song.  That is like the best fucking song out there right now.  I heard the terrestrial radio version when I was in the car.  Oh, it's Forget You or something. 
[02:03:00]  No, it's F.U.  No way.  F.U.  F.U.  Oh, man.  F.U.  It's got to, it doesn't work unless he says fuck you.  We were discussing it yesterday.  Is it just a novelty song?  I don't think it's a, it's more than a novelty song.  It's more than a novelty song because it's done so well.  It sounds so old Motown.  Yeah, it does.  It's great.  You got that, Travis, for the people that haven't heard it yet.  His voice is great.  This song is huge right now.  Yeah, it's just, just to the heart.  It's a little better than you think it's going to be.  I'm driving around town with the girl I love and I'm like, fuck you. 
[02:03:30]  It's great.  I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough.  I'm like, fuck you and I fuck her too.  Said if I was greater, I'd still be with you.  I love that.  I love that.  There it is.  A little taste.  That's good.  And the video's fucking funny as shit. 
[02:04:00]  The original video, they just put the lyrics up there.  But then they did this whole like production number in a diner where he's a little kid  and then high school and a college age and a little kid just like mouthing, fuck you.  He's got his little fucking toy car.  And it's one of those songs you feel like you've heard it before.  You know what I mean?  It's almost like a Stevie Wonder-ish kind of Motown hit song.  But the words are great.  It's just fucking, it's funny as shit.  CeeLo has a new show on Fuse.  Motherfucker CeeLo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we went out to LA to do this convention where you talk about new shows. 
[02:04:30]  And he came down at like seven in the morning to be on this panel.  All these, you know, there's all this press there just wearing the robe from his hood  and nothing under it.  I was like, oh, man.  He crazy.  He's so crazy.  Where's that Ozzy video?  I can't find it.  How'd you see it?  Oh, shit.  It was on the Fuse top 20 countdown.  Oh, Jimmy's going to go nuts now.  Yeah, look at his eyes.  He's got his eyes.  I really want to see it.  Hey, we got a big fan of yours that definitely wants in. 
[02:05:00]  Jay in Jersey.  What's up, Jay?  What's up, Mark?  How you doing, man?  What's up, Jay?  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  All right.  I've been a huge fan for years, dude.  And I just saw you guys play at P&T with Blink.  And I was wondering, what's the deal with the new record, man?  You guys were supposed to come out the last summer and everything.  And it kind of just disappeared.  What's up with that?  I want to hopefully come out.  Yeah, absolutely.  Actually, right now, I'm out of New York taping for Fuse while Travis is on a boat coming 
[02:05:30]  back from our European tour that we just finished.  So when he gets back from...  Why is he on a boat?  He won't fly?  He doesn't fly anymore, no.  Would you?  What a pussy.  Just kidding.  I would never fly again.  Why?  Oh, well.  Jesus.  Wow.  Oh, Jimmy.  We're going to talk in just a second.  Oh, dude.  I didn't make the connection.  We're going to talk in a second.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  Now you're saying that I didn't make the connection.  I honestly didn't.  Okay.  Yeah, so Travis on a boat coming back to the U.S.  and when he gets back to L.A., we're all going to get in the studio.  He's taking a boat from Europe?  Yeah.  That's the dedication that Travis has to tour. 
[02:06:00]  How long is that ride these days?  Well, first of all, he lives in L.A., so he's got to take a bus from L.A. to New York,  get on a boat, and then go overseas.  So that took, like, nine days coming over, no, nine or ten days total, but we finished  our tour last week in Italy.  I flew out to New York, was here for a week, flew home over the weekend, flew back.  Travis isn't even halfway back yet.  I'm here for this whole week taping and then fly back to L.A., and he's still not back yet.  He's taking a Conestoga wagon, I think, from New York then to L.A. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, he's on a raft paddling himself across the ocean.  That's what I would do.  Wow.  How many days is that?  The boat trip alone is 11 days, and then it's another, you know, a few days back.  Do you think he'll ever, now I know why, do you think he'll ever fly again?  Because it's almost like once something like that happens, the odds of, like, you know  that's never in your life going to happen again.  Right.  It's almost like he's the safest guy to fly with, because the odds of that are almost,  astronomically, it's never going to happen again.  Yeah, but just having the horror in your fucking head. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  It's like, oh, yeah, you were gang raped on a pinball machine, but it doesn't mean you  want to lay on a pinball machine again.  Well, I mean, some of us do.  Amy.  Amy.  Would you like to field this one?  I still love it.  Oh, God bless you.  It's a fun game.  Oh, God bless you.  Wow, I did not know that.  Yeah, I don't know if he'll fly again or not.  I figured he wasn't flying anymore, but I didn't think he would be doing European gigs.  Yeah, that's, you know.  Wow.  11 days each way.  11 days each way.  Oh, God.  What the fuck is he doing for 11 days on a boat, you think?  It's, you know what? 
[02:07:30]  Honestly, Travis has it set up so rad.  He's got his drum kit on the boat.  He's got his family with him.  He's got a studio set.  I mean, they give him the run of the place.  In fact, he gets to set up his drum kit every day in, like, their little cabaret theater,  cafe, or whatever it's called, and just jam out by himself for an hour and a half, and  then he's got a studio on the boat and his whole family.  All right, right on, man.  It's like, God, a boat.  His boat better not ever hit an iceberg.  He'll be just, yeah, I'm swimming.  Yeah.  Swimming.  I'll be there in a month.  Fuck it. 
[02:08:00]  I didn't know it was that long of a fucking boat ride.  11.  It's amazing how flying saves you a lot of time.  Let's not forget, as soon as he, then he got it, he has to take the bus from New York  to LA.  What's that, three days?  I'll go home.  Is he going to be on it straight?  Probably.  Oh, it's a tour bus, though.  It's not going to be a great hound.  No, no, no.  It's not like a great hound or anything.  It's like a tour bus.  I swear to God, that's what white trash I am.  I was thinking of that.  That's the only is a tour bus.  We got to get these guys out of here?  Yeah, they have a hard out.  I heard a hard out.  Amy, you have to leave?  Do I have to leave?  She has TV.  Amy has to leave.  What's going on with you?  She's becoming like a star. 
[02:08:30]  She gets a gig, and all of a sudden, she's like, all right, guys, I'm out of here.  See you guys later.  Guys, 30 minutes at a time.  This is, I think, the last time we see you before you get to the point where you're like,  eh, I can't really make it here.  I don't know if I can make it here.  Oh, my gosh.  She was 10 minutes late this morning just getting here.  We saw it.  Didn't I talk about how excited I was to come here?  She was already big-timing you guys before she even got here today.  No way.  I want to live here.  Honestly, for real, when we found out last week that we were going to be doing the show,  she was super excited and was like, oh, you're going to love those guys.  We have so much fun every time I go in there. 
[02:09:00]  I wish I would have known that we just would have given a purposely horrible interview.  Made a really uncomfortable.  I would have just been shut up.  Mark, you're all right, by the way.  I'm going to join you.  I hope you come back and see us.  Absolutely.  Anytime.  Mark Hoppus and, of course, Amy Schumer.  The show is a different spin on Fuse TV going down this Thursday at 7 p.m., and it'll  be on every Thursday at 7, right?  Absolutely.  And Amy will be at the Improv in Chicago September 23rd at 7.30.  Oh, 24th, 25th.  All right.  The 23rd, 24th, 25th. 
[02:09:30]  They wrote the Times.  Yeah.  And at 7.30.  Who's looking at that?  I didn't write that.  Is it 8 o'clock or 8.30?  I can't make it at 7.30.  I can make it at 8.  All right.  We'll go to break, and I got to tweet that picture, because now they're begging for the  t-shirt picture.  The t-shirt.  Can you pull down the shirt a little more?  Yeah, sure.  Let's just take it off.  Why don't we just really make my parents proud I went to college?  Where are you guys going to be on TV quick, you know?  Yeah.  This Thursday we premiere.  What are you doing next?  Oh, we're going to Good Day, New York.  Okay.  Wow.  Good press.  Yes, we'll watch.  We'll watch. 
[02:10:00]  Make sure the nipples pop on TV.  I wouldn't have dressed like a newly homeless woman.  Oh, I hope so.  I mean, no offense to you guys.  Oh, no.  This is Mark and Dangerous Amy.  This is I Just Woke Up Amy, and she's going to be on TV now.  Oh, no.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Get these guys out of here.  She can stay if she wants.  Oh, yay.  Can I stay?  Oh, you don't want to go.  Now this is off.  You don't get to go.  Oh, this is kind of awkward.  She's got to be a fuse at 9.30.  No, you're not on the TV show.  You're not on the TV show.  Thank God. 
[02:10:30]  Thank God.  I hate doing morning shows.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  Can I stay?  No.  You've got to get to the TV.  All right.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Let's have a vote.  I won't vote.  I don't mind her being here.  She was going to blow us off, I think.  Hey.  What happened?  Well, I'm going to go do some big time TV show.  You guys enjoy yourselves.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll figure it out next to you there.  Travis Barker and how he is spending a month just to get back to L.A. 
[02:11:00]  Taking a boat.  Taking a boat from Europe.  Didn't you think it took less than 11 days by boat?  I thought they had that figured out a little bit.  I don't know.  Do they stop anywhere?  Do they go north?  Is it the Queen Mary 2?  Are they also exploring?  11 days doesn't...  We need for new territory to claim.  Are they getting some molasses?  Yes, they have been.  We have to stop off and get spices. 
[02:11:30]  I need to know, man.  I thought they had that figured out.  How long was the Titanic if it would have made it?  Oh, Christ.  If it would have made it.  That's fucking forever ago.  But how long was that?  A movie.  A couple of weeks.  I want to know...  The movie was real time, yeah.  I want to know how long it takes to go from New York to Europe.  Titanic time and now time.  Only a few ships can make the journey.  Best known being the Queen Elizabeth II, depending on the number of ports I call. 
[02:12:00]  The average trip is roughly 6 to 14 days.  Boy, that's kind of a big gap there.  6 or 14 days.  Yeah, what's going on?  Yeah.  All those trips are longer.  Ships traveling from North America to Park, several, blah, blah, blah, Boston, Virginia,  where they terminate their voyage, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, who cares, who cares, who cares?  So, anywhere from one to two weeks.  You know, I understand he doesn't want to fly anymore, but I would assume it's way more  dangerous to fucking take a boat across the ocean. 
[02:12:30]  Okay.  In this day and age?  Well, I was just trying to stay in the camp.  I don't know, man.  How many ships have sunk and killed, like, a lot of people?  Unless it's those, you know, Indian fucking...  Or, like, the guys on The Deadliest Catch.  Yeah, those guys.  It's like, they're not going to make him crab on the trip.  Yeah, yeah, they don't have to crab.  He's got to load up some crab pots.  We're also going to be filming Shark Week with you.  Yeah.  But he's not a fucking long-line fisherman off of Massachusetts.  Right.  Or anything like that.  And what about the pirates?  That's true. 
[02:13:00]  There's pirates out there.  There are pirates.  You're not going to Somalia.  There's pirates out there.  That's going from, like, fucking England, leaving on the Queen Elizabeth II.  What about the Nova Scotia pirates?  Oh, yeah.  I think they're dangerous.  They've been dead for a while.  Oh, how about the Pittsburgh ones?  Oh, come on, Chimby.  Oh, Chim.  Chim, the Pittsburgh pirates are a baseball team.  Is Italy farther?  Italy?  From the other parts of Europe?  From, like, England? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  England, I think it's a little further.  I think, yeah.  Look at some maps.  Look at some maps.  London to New York's closer than...  Italy's the boot, right?  Yeah, it's the boot.  All right, good.  It's the boot.  You got that, at least.  I just went to Europe for the first time.  Yeah?  I went to Sweden to do comedy.  You ever go to Sweden, Jimmy?  I have not, no.  It was...  I went to Stockholm, and everyone there was...  They were all the most beautiful people I've ever seen.  It was frustrating.  Like, I went into a Pizza Hut, and the guy behind the counter, I'm not... 
[02:14:00]  No bullshit, was, like, the most attractive man I've ever seen.  Really?  And I'm staring at him, and they speak perfect English, and he's looking at...  He's like, why are you looking at me?  I'm like, because if you work at a Pizza Hut in New York, you could be retarded.  And not just, like, a little retarded, like, so retarded, it looks like you're making  fun of retarded people.  You know, just the, like, the swaying and everything.  Profoundly.  But he was so hot.  He's, like, wearing a visor, and he had sauce all over his face.  And I was like, I'll leave my life in New York for you.  Like, everyone was gorgeous.  Wow.  Gorgeous.  Did you bang anybody? 
[02:14:30]  No, I came close, though.  Why didn't you?  Why didn't you?  I don't know.  They have different diseases.  Oh, yeah.  No, I came close.  Do they really have different diseases?  I don't know.  They have the same.  They hadn't heard of HPV yet.  I was like, let me bring that spice over here for you.  But, no, I hooked up with this guy, but we didn't have sex, because we didn't have  a condom, and he said no.  And he said no.  I was like, but it's so late.  He's like, no, this one doesn't really go down here. 
[02:15:00]  Did he at least finger pop you?  I finger popped him.  He loved it.  He loved it.  Finger pop.  That's funny.  No bag.  Hey, by the way, getting back to the plane crash thing, I thought that was, well, I'm  not sure.  It's an instant feedback guy.  DJ AM, who was on the Travis Barker plane crash.  He was supposed to be on the Buffalo plane crash, too.  So, it does strike twice.  That guy was like final destination.  I think that was in the news, that DJ AM was supposed to be on the plane that went  down in Buffalo.  God.  So, that would have been two for him. 
[02:15:30]  By the way, the Alaskan senator or the Alaskan guy who was killed in a plane crash, he had  been in another plane crash, too.  But, that was like, he flies like small planes in Alaska.  Yeah, that's about to happen.  You're just asking for trouble.  Yeah, I mean, the weather conditions are there.  Small planes in Alaska, really?  The planes probably get eroded by the weather.  Right.  What are you now?  Aviation expert?  Jimmy and aviation.  Yes, the rivets, the integrity of the rivets do degrade over time.  Ooh, rivets.  Did you say rivets at first?  Rivets.  Is Sweden a fun place? 
[02:16:00]  What do you do for fun?  Do you like meatballs?  Oh, come on.  Oh, shit.  Do you like the Swedish chef?  I liked it.  No, it really was.  Yeah?  It was cool.  Yeah, I've been places over there that I've been like, could take or leave, but it was  great.  How was the gig?  The people.  It was awesome.  Really?  I like won.  I didn't know that they gave awards.  I won the festival.  They gave me like a plaque on like a piece of wood, like a log, you know, and I go out  and I was already drunk.  I had no idea they were giving awards.  And so I made a speech.  You didn't shove up a horse's ass, did you? 
[02:16:30]  No.  Sorry.  That little angel.  Poor angel.  There's a video of me accepting it online and it's just me.  I'm like, thank you so much.  I blacked out here.  I had sex with strangers.  I'm like, this isn't the first time a guy's given me wood, but I'll never forget it.  And the crowd was just like, bleh.  What?  But yeah, no, it was a total blast.  Yeah, they got everything.  But it was like just little differences.  Like this girl I asked, I was like, are the guys here circumcised?  Because I don't want to run into that again.  And she was like, she's like, kind of. 
[02:17:00]  Uh-oh.  I was like, do you guys just take half of it away?  It looks like it's wanking at you.  Like wearing a hoodie.  But yeah, because I told you about that.  Oh, yeah.  That's got to be a nightmare for a girl not knowing.  Not being ready.  You know, you just want to be prepared at least for all the leg work you're going to have  to do.  It's different vaginas, obviously.  But you're never going to get such a drastic difference as a circumcised or uncircumcised 
[02:17:30]  penis with a vagina.  You're never going to have to get that much stuff out of the way.  No, no.  Well, hopefully not.  Please don't start pulling up pictures of fucked up.  No, Danny, no.  What?  Oh, God.  We're looking for you, Amy, so we're making sure we know what you're talking about here.  Thank you.  Ugly vagina.  I left here feeling so weak and fucked up.  I'm not looking.  I am not looking.  I have a long day ahead of me.  Oh, okay.  It's just some kind of a sewn together thing.  Did we show you the blue waffle last time?  Yes, you did.  Oh, God. 
[02:18:00]  Don't put that on.  Then we were doing our jobs that day.  We changed the name to the blue oyster cunt.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, the blue oyster cunt.  That's right.  No, I don't want to deal with that anymore.  How come you're not doing TV with Mark?  Yeah, what's that about?  He should have both of you.  I'm happy.  You're the eye candy.  Yeah, not this morning.  Not this morning.  Yeah, I'm just like, no, I'm happy for anything they include me in and I'm very happy when  they don't.  I think there's trouble between you two because you didn't know he was doing TV.  That's going to cause problems with you two.  No.  Press is, I'm happy to just, this is, I'm very happy to hear. 
[02:18:30]  No, you should be doing TV because you're a comic.  Yeah, you should be.  You're funny.  Yeah, no, but it's, you know, it's his show, I'm the co-host, so there, and I really do  feel like I'm easily replaceable.  Really?  What did he do in Blink-182?  Because I'm not, I wasn't.  He's the bassist.  Okay.  Who else was in that band?  The Travis?  I don't, I'm not familiar with that.  Yeah, Travis Barker.  And who else?  Another guy.  Another guy.  DJ AM used to.  Some other guy.  Was he in it too?  No.  DJ AM wasn't in.  Oh, no, he.  Side project?  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  Wow, I was just trying to, like, sound smart and I look like a complete asshole now. 
[02:19:00]  Trying to sound knowledgeable.  I really don't know Blink-182.  No?  I never really got into this stuff.  I bet you know more songs than you think.  Oh, I know the songs.  Oh, okay, okay.  If I heard them, absolutely.  What's a big song by them?  What's My Age Again?  Real catchy stuff.  Damn it.  That song, Damn It.  Okay.  Look at that.  Damn it.  Now he's just doing his own thing.  He's just, like, pulling up videos he likes.  Show Amy that one.  That's easy.  That's an easy one.  Amy, you could watch this one. 
[02:19:30]  What is it?  This is an easy one.  This is easy.  The calmer you sound, the more, I mean, you sound like any guy that was trying to bag me  in college.  It's easy.  You're going to, you know, the truth about the size always comes when they're trying to  get you to do anal.  Look, you can handle that, right?  Oh, God.  What?  Is he coming all the nightmares I've ever had?  She's puking on his hard arm.  Okay.  The number of times I've wanted to do that.  I realized, I was talking to one of my friends this weekend about, like, because she likes 
[02:20:00]  porn, too.  And just about the differences.  I don't know if it's like this for men, too.  Like, the porn I like, I would never want to actually happen to me.  Is that what it is for men, too?  No, I'm just the opposite.  They really would want it to happen.  Sure.  Amy, I've got to go serious for a second.  Sure.  I've been watching, I did watch Last Comic Standing, and I was yelling at my TV, and  you're here.  Okay.  You weren't on Last Comic Standing, but you might as well have been, because Will Lewis,  thank you, from Houston.  Is Amy pissed about Nikki Glaser?  No, she's a good friend of mine. 
[02:20:30]  She sounds like you.  I don't think so.  I thought so.  Really?  I didn't know you guys were friends, and I feel bad.  Oh, no, no.  She's, no, she's great.  I don't think so.  I don't think we sound like...  Oh, man, I thought so.  Really?  Because you've got a unique style.  You've got to protect your fucking stand-up, man.  But the thing is, it's like, you know, if you're both living your lives slutty and a  little racist, what are you going to do?  Switch that up, you know?  Like, I think Nikki and I are similar people.  I don't know her, so fuck her.  I mean, they're taking the high road, which is fine.  But I'm telling you, when I was watching, I thought, oh, my God, this one is doing Amy 
[02:21:00]  Schumer.  It's tough, though, for comics.  Like, you know, watching the VMAs last night, I was like, oh, Chelsea Handler.  You know, she, like, drops some racist shit, and she's slutty, too.  And, like, it's just how you're living your life.  It's the cadence you have when you do it, though.  Oh, yeah.  It's extremely similar.  All right, well, you can move on, but I'm just trying to protect you.  Thanks.  No, no.  I know.  Nikki's, she's great.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, I didn't know you were friends.  Amy right now is holding up a C with her hand. 
[02:21:30]  No, no.  Do I know Nikki?  I don't know.  She's great.  All right, your mic's off.  What do you really think?  Bitch.  No, no, no.  She's great.  I'm happy to badmouth people, but I think Nikki's great.  All right.  I noticed, and some other people noticed.  That's all I'm saying.  Awkward.  So.  Awkward.  I don't know.  What else?  They're best friends.  They're lesbian lovers.  I didn't even know.  Had I not experimented with her, this conversation would go a different way, but.  No, actually, she's who I was talking to about the porn. 
[02:22:00]  Huh?  She's who I was talking to.  Oh, really?  The one you were talking to about porn?  Yeah, because she likes porn, too.  Yeah.  So what kind of porn?  Yeah, kind of porn.  Like, I want this stuff to happen.  You want it to happen.  Yeah.  Have you ever?  I've spent a lot of money for it to happen, actually.  Sure.  Okay.  And you've been happy.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  It worked out.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  Like, I think I would just hate it.  Like, I like to watch a girl with a lot of guys.  Gangbang, yeah.  Yeah, but I would never, like, I don't even want to have, you know, it's hard to tell  one guy that you don't feel like doing it, you know?  Imagine, like, having to explain it to a whole room, like, hey, you guys, like, oh, so sorry. 
[02:22:30]  As they're doing that.  Somebody feels bloated.  This is super.  Like, group cuddle?  Who's in?  Who wants?  Rain check.  Like, you know, everybody clears their schedules, and then you're just like, oh, not in the mood.  As they're doing that awkward jerk thing.  Yeah, like, what do they talk about while they're waiting in the room before?  Like, so are you in sales?  You know?  Craigslist is great.  Like, what do they do? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I kind of like, I kind of like pretty standard porn.  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah.  How standard?  Like, all I need, really, is a naked, totally naked.  I don't want fucking sexy shoes or stockings.  Some, like, sock on.  Completely naked.  And, like, she's got to be looking at the camera.  Really?  I kind of like that.  Like, hi.  Hey, I'm doing this.  Hey, watch me.  Look what I'm doing.  Look at what filthy thing I'm doing. 
[02:23:30]  Interesting.  Yeah, that's good.  Did you go, like, did you go too far with looking at things that you went back to?  Oh, no, no, no.  I don't go too far.  Believe me, I'll look at anything.  Right, right, right.  I'll look at a horse getting a baseball bat up its ass.  I wonder that about guys.  Go back to that again.  You know, because you can see anything.  Like, if somebody just, then it's never enough to you go back to just wanting to see a girl's  foot, you know?  Yeah, right.  Oh, look at that ankle.  Do you kiss while you fuck?  It looks supple.  Well, it all depends.  At night.  It all depends.  Yeah, I was always asking Anthony about that. 
[02:24:00]  It depends on who you're with.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you kind of, you know, care about the person.  Oh, Grant Hill.  Grant Hill.  Grant Hill just walking on by.  Speaking of the porn I like.  I think he has a big cock.  Amy.  Let's find out.  I'll be right back.  Jesus, he's a tall fucker.  I think we found out that you have not been fouled.  I've never, I've never even made out with a black guy.  By the, you know, I'm young.  Interracial.  Oh, so there's still time.  There's still time.  Now, Patrice was here last time you were here. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Was he?  No, no.  Or the time before.  I think one, like the last time he was here, he, you guys talked about, but I wasn't here.  Oh, okay.  There was something going on because then me and Patrice left.  We go to the garage and stuff.  And I was like, I said, I go, you know, Amy's very cute.  Thanks.  And, um, and he kind of made the face like, enough about Amy.  Why?  Like, I don't think he's into you, your, like, type.  Um.  But he's, he likes Amy a lot.  Oh, he likes, oh no, he likes you as a comic and everything. 
[02:25:00]  But as far as just, you know.  He doesn't see me as, like, sexual, I don't think.  No, that's what he was getting at.  It was like, it was like.  Was he being serious?  You never know when Patrice was telling the truth.  No, no, I think he was being serious.  I don't know.  Sometimes I think it's like, you know, Patrice is definitely, there's a lot of product of what happened to him in high school.  It still is around.  So maybe I, I am just that girl to him that he, like, he's like, I would never, because, you know, I don't know.  Turned him down too many times in high school kind of a thing.  But, but I could be totally wrong.  But he always is saying, like, you're cute, but you're not, like, and I'm like, no. 
[02:25:30]  Like, I'll, I'll tear anyone apart.  Like, trust me, I'm a dirtbag, you know.  But he just doesn't, he just sees me as, like, his next door neighbor.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was, I found that odd.  You know, Patrice seems like.  Yeah.  Go for anybody.  Not that I'm saying, like, hey, he'd even go for you.  The gauntlet's been thrown.  Let's see.  My new reality show.  I'll get Patrice to fuck me.  No, I wouldn't mess with his chick.  I would not mess with his chick.  Oh, my God. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, yeah.  She's cool.  I'm not going to get in her.  She definitely looks like she could kick ass.  Yeah.  You, uh, you try to steer clear of, like, going out and having sex or dating comics or anything?  Uh, at first I was like, absolutely no thank you, you know.  And then you just run into them.  I've only slept with one comedian.  Oh, wow.  Ever.  Yeah.  And, uh, well, actually one comedian's bodyguard.  Uh.  He's tall.  He looks like Larch.  He's extremely stupid. 
[02:26:30]  He's got the mind of a five-year-old.  And a cop to match.  Where is Kenny?  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I think.  Amy.  Thank you, Amy.  Do you need anything?  Oh, God.  That felt fantastic.  Here comes, uh, Kenny.  Now.  Oh, there he is.  Uh-oh.  I just want to clear up.  Oh, here he is.  I'm a happily married man.  I love my wife, but I'm not happy.  Amy, I didn't like the fact that Fuse didn't have you in any of the comments. 
[02:27:00]  commercials.  Oh, thanks, Kenny.  Shit.  Yeah, I just happened to be watching the other day, and every commercial Blake had that guy.  Blake?  Yeah, blink.  Every commercial Blake?  Blake.  Yeah, break.  Oh, break.  Oh, break.  Had that guy.  That was crumb soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Kenny's Asian today.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And you weren't in one commercial.  No.  I don't go for that.  No, well, the truth is I haven't, I hadn't signed a contract yet when they did all this. 
[02:27:30]  Ah.  All right.  Well, I hope they do the right thing.  Thank you.  I think that pregnancy thing might have really pissed them off.  Kenny, how was your...  I was just like, this is how it's going to be.  Keep her out of commercials.  Let's ask Kenny about his break.  How was your vacation, Kenny?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you do anything fun?  I ate ice cream three times.  Okay.  Oh, great.  Your shifts must have been enchanting.  He has, like, burns on his hand from holding sparklers too long.  Kenny never allows himself to eat ice cream three times.  This is big news, Andy. 
[02:28:00]  He might eat a cookie or a little ice cream once every other week or something.  He sends food back a lot.  Yeah.  You're a bad man.  Wow.  What kind of ice cream was it, Kenny?  Um, one was a chocolate and vanilla twist.  Wow.  Even his ice cream's boring.  Really lame.  You know what they're doing with ice cream these days?  They're putting sprinkles on it, Kenny.  I know.  I know.  That's very extravagant.  Yeah.  He wouldn't allow himself that.  No, that's too crazy.  That's simple pleasure. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, boy.  I don't deserve luxury.  No.  He might not be completely miserable if he actually has something he enjoys for a second.  Yeah.  I wouldn't want to see a happy Kenny.  Can you imagine, like, a born-again happy?  Oh, gross.  You want to clear this up, Amy?  People think you slept with Yakov Smirnoff.  No, that is true.  That is true.  If you mean blacking out on Smirnoff ices and sleeping with strangers, then yes.  Then we're in.  They didn't get along at the end, though, because he would go, what a cunt.  No, I love that.  I love that. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, it's terrific.  Kenny, what other ice cream?  Tell us about your break.  What else did you do?  You ate ice cream three times?  Yeah.  Another time was just a scoop of vanilla I got by default because somebody, like, ordered  dessert and they made, like, a big presentation.  Yeah.  So they allowed me to have the ice cream.  They allowed you to have.  Yeah.  You're a grown man.  What, are you, a kid who just got his tonsils out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the third time, we got to ask for the third time now.  The third time I ate in my house, I had a chocolate, chocolate chip Weight Watchers ice cream. 
[02:29:30]  Whoa.  Now we're talking.  Yeah.  Nobody parties like you guys.  It's just crazy.  Yeah.  And this is your whole vacation.  Well, I didn't get invited to any parties.  Oh.  See, y'all.  Yes, you did.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Who's the party?  I invited Kenny.  Yes.  To what?  James did ask me if I was going.  Yeah.  To where?  To Anthony's.  Yeah.  And I invited Kenny to dinner a couple times. 
[02:30:00]  He wouldn't see me.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's true.  He was in seclusion.  Yeah.  James did invite me to a steak dinner.  That's very nice.  And you like steak.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So why didn't you go?  I blew him off.  He did.  Did you go away on vacation?  I was spending quality time with my wife.  Did she have any say in that?  No.  We're married.  Oh, right.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  What a lucky angel.  No, I did spend a few wonderful days in Ocean City, Maryland with my family. 
[02:30:30]  Did you do touristy things?  Oh.  Yeah.  We went to that Asperger's Island where they have wild horses.  That's a disorder.  That's a form of autism, Kenny.  Which you probably have, by the way.  You definitely have it.  Definitely.  Have you ever...  No, it's like a famous island.  It's like 75 miles long, like between Maryland and Virginia.  His wife was trying to take him to a leper colony.  You think Kenny's a grown-up autistic kid? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  I would put a lot of money on it.  So for the parents out there that have autistic kids, they're going to put a lot of money on it.  They'll turn out like Kenny.  That's right.  Well, I could drive a jet ski.  That's nice.  You drove a jet ski?  Nice.  Yeah.  Did you get on the bumper cars?  Yeah.  What about the wild horses?  Was that fun?  No, you just like look at them.  And then, you know, we were on like this boat trip.  And then I was seeing how far I could crack jokes about, you know, because he's explaining  how like the stallion has like the herd of mares. 
[02:31:30]  And I was seeing how I could work in like a fucking joke.  In like mixed company.  That's the tree.  A fucking joke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was your wife rolling her eyes?  She sits in the back.  She don't sit near me.  She doesn't sit near you?  No, no, no, no, no.  Wow.  You two.  Wow.  You two have to rekindle and get like a spark back.  No, it's all good.  I've got a hedonism.  It's good.  I'm sure it's hedonism. 
[02:32:00]  Imagine Kenny at hedonism.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Seeing him walk down the beach.  Kenny the cuck.  Go to Burning Man or something.  All naked in the desert.  Yeah.  No, but thank you for asking.  I had a nice vacation.  Sounded.  Oh, God.  Like a terrific vacation.  Yeah, no.  And GH invited me to go to where he was, too.  Yeah.  Oh, see, you got invited everywhere, but you didn't go.  Yeah.  Fucking nine hours in a car. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, it was a little much.  Why would you do that to hang out at a beach house for two weeks?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Yeah, no.  I don't know.  Ocean view.  Yeah, we had to deal with a hurricane.  I just.  And he's got to go now.  I'll just go.  Yeah, she had to line.  I'm going to ask Iraq how sad he is, because he's the go-to guy now, as far as all the big  jokes go.  Yeah, he is.  You want to be?  Without Steve.  That's literally the big jokes. 
[02:33:00]  You know, you know you're going to get.  What?  No.  Wait.  Where are you going?  Where are you going, though?  Now I have to go to Fuse.  Fuse.  Oh.  Yeah.  For real?  Thanks.  Thank you so much.  By the way, Mark Hoppus, who was on the show.  Did you say his last name?  Yeah, Hoppus.  Give us a nice Twitter mention.  He has a fucking a million seven Twitter followers.  He's a good boy.  What a sweet boy.  Yes, he is.  He's a good boy.  Well, thanks, guys.  You've got to be getting a lot, right?  I've got like five.  That's nice.  Five followers.  Oh, I've got like five.  No, I've got like. 
[02:33:30]  I think I have 9,000.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  A lot from the show.  So, thank you.  What's your name?  Amy.  Amy Schumer.  Amy.  Amy, if you give us a topless picture, I can get you a 10,000 today.  That's really sweet.  Thank you so much.  Because it's all about Twitter followers.  The offers.  That's what I need.  To just degrade yourself.  Titters.  Titter, yeah.  Guys, thank you so much.  Thank you, Amy.  Amy, the big plug.  Thursday on Fuse TV, 7 o'clock, a different spin with Mark Hoppus.  Sounds like it's going to be a good show. 
[02:34:00]  I hope so.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, Amy.  Bye.  Take it easy.  Bye, Amy.  Yeah, nice.  She's got to walk out awkwardly.  Pulls the little shirt over her shoulder.  Makes weird faces.  It's quite a T-shirt.  So, it's not as awkward.  She goes down the hall.  With that A's.  Yeah.  Ask for D's.  What would you do with that A's?  Yes.  Yes.  Something about that girl.  You like the Amy shirt, huh?  I like Amy.  I think she's very cute.  Yeah.  She scares me. 
[02:34:30]  Why is that?  She might be one of those girls that laughs at you during the sex act.  Because she likes the jokes.  Then you push it in fucking harder and deeper.  Hit cervix and make them go, ow.  Because she's all about the jokes.  Yeah.  All about the jokes.  All of a sudden, there's some kind of fucked up joke.  You don't want to have them laughing at your balls or something?  Right.  Make a joke about your nuts?  Something.  Then, you know, next time we have to ask her about that.  Does she take her sex seriously or is there jokes?  God damn.  Is she listening down the hall? 
[02:35:00]  I don't know.  Is she listening?  We might get the answer.  If Amy's still listening, we want to know when you're having sex, is it all about the  sex?  The jokes.  Or do you throw some jokes in there?  Look at that.  That's a nice slutty picture.  I heard Danny just pulled up a slutty picture.  She's wearing a little slinky dress.  She's got a cigarette in her mouth.  She's making kind of an err face.  I was, wow.  I didn't know they were friends.  But the last comic standing female comic had the whole Amy Schumer thing down.  Really?  Absolutely.  Here comes Amy. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, she's coming back down the hallway.  We're going to get an answer.  Yeah.  It's all about the jokes.  All about the jokes.  Sometimes guys don't take the jokes in bed too well.  I kind of like, I know Jimmy does a little.  Amy.  I know you got to go to Fuse TV.  Straight up filth.  Straight up filth.  For real?  Nice.  Look at her.  And she's serious about it.  Just walks out.  Straight face.  Just went, no, straight up filth.  No jokes.  And then that was it. 
[02:36:00]  How hot is that, Ant?  Bury your face in her ass.  Yeah.  That'd be great, right?  Right?  I never think of Amy like that.  And I'm not being.  Oh, shut up.  Dude, I'm a piece of shit.  I would tell you.  You think about us in that way.  Why not Amy?  I just think of jerking you both off onto a cracker and like accidentally bumping your dickheads.  And like that little string of clear stuff that would connect them.  Oh, God.  Damn.  No, no, no.  I don't think about anything dirty with you.  As a joke, like I think of you both standing there with your boners. 
[02:36:30]  And I fucking.  Oh, you haven't thought about this at all, right, Jimmy?  I spit in each hand and I just jerk them like this.  And pound the heads together.  And the heads bang together.  Yeah, yeah.  And my fucking.  And the back of my hands keep bumping each other.  And the fucking clear string that attaches.  It's just kind of going wah, wah back and forth.  And then the one comes all over the other one.  And then I'm fucking flogging the one and it's soft with cum on it.  Totally.  But you haven't thought about this?  No.  Not at all.  You're awful.  But people on Twitter are such fucking cunts, like such babies. 
[02:37:00]  What happened now?  I do a joke about the mosque.  Like, and the joke was, you know, I'm so sick of this fucking Ground Zero mosque.  I've had left to hear with this fucking thing.  And so I wrote, Islam also suffered terribly on 9-11.  The Ground Zero mosque is simply a tribute to the 19 lives that were lost.  All right.  It's a goof on the fucking intention of the mosque.  And, uh, one guy, there was a shitload of other Muslims that died that weren't on those planes. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, fucking, hey, jerk off.  How do you follow me and know the type of comic I am and get offended at that?  And not understand what you were doing.  God almighty.  By the way.  Fuck that guy who wants to put a mosque down there.  And fuck his affiliations.  Yes.  I don't believe him.  I think he's fucking, uh, he's moderate compared to some of them.  Yeah.  But, uh, God almighty.  What a bunch of babies.  Get the...  By that I mean people on Twitter.  Yes, of course.  Fucking assholes. 
[02:38:00]  Morons.  Yeah.  Ugh.  You know what?  You know what, Jim?  What?  Asshole.  Really?  I didn't realize any other Muslims died.  I literally only thought it was 19.  Yes.  Uh, did you see the guy burning the, uh, Koran and, in front of, uh, Ground Zero?  I was watching the video of it and I was just like, this is the absolute wrong guy to do this.  Cause I think he was just, he just looks like some fat hillbilly. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, I said don't.  And he's, he's burning a couple of pages.  And he didn't have anything to say.  Like, the news was asking him, why are you doing this?  And instead of saying something like, well, I'm exercising my freedom, uh, to protest.  Or something, he was just walking, I'm here, I'm tough.  Oh, like a shark jock.  Had nothing to say.  It was like a shark jock.  Yeah, yeah.  And he had, he had nothing to say.  He, they were like, why are you doing this?  At least have some kind of statement as to why you're doing it.  Right.  By the way, there was some Christian stab.  He's a hack. 
[02:39:00]  In like, Indonesia.  Oh, of course.  Which is a, I think 90% Muslim country.  Yes.  Which again, it happens.  But, all of a sudden this, you know what's interesting to me?  Nobody was talking about, and again, I Twittered this, I'm not trying to quote my own Twitter,  but nobody fucking is talking about tolerance of the pastor that wanted to burn those fucking  Korans.  Right.  Nobody was talking about, you know what, uh, we, we, we have to show sensitivity to his  right to express himself, even though we don't agree.  It was always, the president came out and everybody.  Oh, yeah.  And I understand it was bad to do because of troops getting hurt, and that's why I was 
[02:39:30]  against it, because you don't want to see fucking troops being injured.  That's the only reason.  Yeah.  But, uh, it's amazing the attitude of a guy like that.  Well, just the fact that they had to say, look, you can't burn this because these people  will commit horrid, violent acts against Americans all over the place and other people.  Doesn't that prove the point right there? 
[02:40:00]  If you're afraid to, uh, protest and, and show how you feel about something by burning  something in effigy or a flag or even a religious document or book, um, you shouldn't have to  worry that the repercussions are going to include horrid deaths of people, unless the  people that are perpetrating it are a horrible, savage, murderous people.  It's fucking, it is amazing.  It's just annoying, the attitude of the whole thing. 
[02:40:30]  It is.  The way the president, why is the president commenting on what some fucking hillbilly,  and this preacher, I think, is basically a shithead because he lines up sometimes with  the Westboro Baptist Church.  Yeah, yeah, he is an asshole.  And, uh, and they're just repulsive.  So it's not like I'm siding with them, but it's, why is the president commenting on some  jagoff that wants to fucking exercise his right to free speech?  You know what you do?  You get a big 55-gallon drum, you poke some holes in the side, you get the Koran, you 
[02:41:00]  get the Torah, you get the Bible, you get whatever, all the fucking religious pieces of shit you  can find, pile them all in there, douse it with gas, and light it on fire, and then, there!  Say, is everyone so offended now?  Everything's burning.  Who cares?  And by the way, it just came up with our next bit.  There you go.  Let's do this.  Let's burn every single religious book we can find.  How much trouble do you think you would be in?  None, really.  Legally, none.  I've always been into book burnings throughout history.  Well, the thing is, it's like, people say, well, how come you look at Muslims a certain 
[02:41:30]  way?  I want to know, where was one, and again, it may have existed and we didn't know it, where  was one Muslim voice saying, it's despicable, but they should absolutely, this guy should  have the right to burn that Koran because it's his freedom of speech.  People talk about, well, why aren't Americans embracing Muslims?  Where was one Muslim voice sticking up for that basic American right?  Well, one, I heard, I read comments on a lot of websites where they showed the video and 
[02:42:00]  it was all, well, if the American flag is not a religious article, it is different to  burn the American flag, because they just burned the American flag like crazy.  Of course, effigies of Bush, every president, yes.  It's a book, book burners, book burners, like Hitler fascist.  There's a guy in the background screaming shit out where this guy is burning a couple of  the pages of the Koran, and I want to fucking choke him.  He's just yelling, bloody, bloody, leave, just leave. 
[02:42:30]  Get back in your cab.  I hate him.  Not one, and again, if I'm wrong, correct me, but I didn't hear of any Muslims defending  that guy's right to do it because of free speech.  Nope.  Their religion, more important than his right to free speech.  Yeah.  So don't act like you're fucking crazy that Americans aren't, we're crazy for not embracing  Islam.  Yeah, sorry.  Sorry.  It's not our cup of tea.  We're not really into, you know, burying fucking rape victims up to their arms and stoning 
[02:43:00]  their faces.  Speak for yourself.  I know, you know, I said we.  I mean.  I collect them.  Yes.  I mean, that's always got to go horrible.  Of course it does.  I love it.  Obviously, 9-11 just passed, too.  What?  I just took, I was thinking about you, Ant, because, well, okay.  I did a 10-hour drive yesterday, right?  North Carolina, New York City, the day after 9-11. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Well, the anniversary of.  And I remember how you said people have forgotten.  Remember 9-12-2001, there were fucking American flags everywhere?  Everywhere, flying.  9-12-2010.  I can tell you after a 10-hour drive, I didn't see one fucking flag.  Not one flag flying off a car.  Remember?  Not one.  And I did.  I said that.  I said, fuck this.  Fuck Americans.  I don't want to go too deep into this.  I'm just going with the fact that we do just kind of move on and go back to how things were. 
[02:44:00]  And people were like, we didn't forget.  It's like, just shut up.  People forgot the, not the, you didn't forget what happened.  And I'm not delusional, but everyone, not everyone, a lot of people, it seems, forgot the emotion that came about with it.  They forgot the anger and the want for some type of retribution and the need to feel like they're protected against something like that happening again.  And you never would have thought we would have a president named Barack Hussein Obama. 
[02:44:30]  I'm sorry.  We never would have thought that would happen.  We never thought there'd be a mosque being built and that there would even be a controversy.  Right.  That fucking place, if there were plans a month after September 11, 2001, to build a mosque right down there, it wouldn't even be an issue.  Everyone would have come out against it. 
[02:45:00]  We would have had that fireman guy talking about Osama bin Laden.  Hey, kiss my ass.  Kiss my ass.  He would have been down there yelling that through a bullhorn.  But people forget, and then the fucking dumb, cunty college pukes that weren't even a fucking, didn't have a pube on them when it happened, are the ones where, of course, the conspiracy theories that we need tolerance and it's not all of Islam that's this or that.  It's just, I'm tired of this country making excuses for being this country. 
[02:45:30]  Right.  And by the way, I'll continue to say it, that's why we're hated by Islam, is because of who we are, how we live, the American way of life.  Unless we all change to fucking Islam, we will be hated by Islam.  It's in their fucking book.  It's in the book.  Yeah.  If you're not a fucking Muslim, you are a problem. 
[02:46:00]  And they have ways of dealing with their problems, and it's normally a violent way.  So, why am I going to, why do I have to be tolerant of some savage fucking religion?  I'm sorry, I'm not tolerant.  Oh, I had a great take on it.  Me!  I was driving home yesterday, and I happened to have the George Carlin box set of all the HBO specials in the ride.  So, I was just popping them in, man, popping them in.  It was a George Carlin fucking road trip.  That's great. 
[02:46:30]  And I just so happened to play the one that he did right after 9-11.  Oh, wow.  I was at that show, actually, in the front row, but I'm not on the HBO special because I was part of the safety show.  Oh.  I hate that.  Oh, one more for safety.  We were all excited.  I'm like, holy shit, I'm in the front row.  I'm going to be, you know, in the audience for this.  Yeah.  Because I was the safety show.  But his take on the whole thing was great.  How it takes a ridiculous tragedy to bring everyone together as Americans, but then, you know, the tragedy kind of goes away after time. 
[02:47:00]  And then, you just go back to being fucking assholes to each other.  Yeah, everyone goes back to whatever.  Just being assholes to each other.  Yeah, being assholes.  Remember letting people into traffic?  Ah, the whole thing.  Everyone was happy.  Not happy, but everyone was, you know, oh, look, we're all Americans.  How long did that feeling last, though?  Yeah, an hour.  A couple weeks?  An hour with me on the road.  Did we make it a couple weeks before we went back to hating each other?  Because the first week or so, it was just amazing.  Yeah.  You got a glimpse of what it could be out there.  People were all polite. 
[02:47:30]  Where everyone's working together and being nice to each other and helping each other out.  I remember stopping and waving people in and going, okay, go ahead.  All that shit.  Go ahead.  And you give a wave.  Not even that.  And someone nods to you like, yeah, I understand we're all in this together.  Not even that.  You're just acknowledging people.  You're talking to complete strangers.  Yeah.  You're bonding with people you would never bond with.  Not Muslims.  And then it all just fucking went away.  Now we have to be so tolerant.  I don't want to be tolerant.  I'm tired.  I have no tolerance for being tolerant.  I'd be a lot more tolerant if I heard one fucking reasonable voice coming from them. 
[02:48:00]  Like, again, this guy is the voice of reason and he wants to put a mosque right there and he doesn't want to hear it.  Although I'm afraid now if I move it, it will cause radicals to react violently.  Oh, really?  Yeah, really?  Is that what causes it?  Fucking asshole.  Isn't that what we're saying?  How come it's always the threat of them acting violently against anything we do?  And that's where this we have to be tolerant comes from. 
[02:48:30]  It's not that we have to be tolerant because we respect them or we're trying to get some kind of peace with them or let us each know what each other is about.  It's always based on we need to be tolerant or they'll blow some shit up or fucking stab a guy that's drawn a cartoon or fucking whatever else, whatever other savage way they're going to kill.  Or they'll bring down a plane or they'll bring down a plane and then give a hero's welcome to the guy when he's released from jail or they'll fucking kill more civilians and it will be excused as well. 
[02:49:00]  The end justifies the means.  Well, you know, you guys did this.  You burnt the Koran.  Cares.  It's always based on a threat of violence and it's fear that people don't want to express their freedom of expression in that way because they know that they're going to get their fucking head lopped off and get in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
[02:49:30]  Fuck them.  I say fuck them.  I'm not even trying to hide this shit anymore.  Fuck them.  I just wish that there was a fucking more reasonable voice and I know you hear, well, there's a lot of moderate, but it's like, where is there one moderate Muslim who will say, you know what?  That pastor should be allowed to do that because America has a free speech and I don't like it, but his right to free speech is very important.  Yeah.  I didn't hear that at all.  No, the moderate month.  I love that thing I read. 
[02:50:00]  I was like, what does the Easter bunny, a unicorn and a moderate Muslim have in common?  Um, um, the, the need for no punchline chip.  I was going to say that they all like, um, eating candy and going to clouds or something.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You can work on that one.  Yeah.  It's good though.  It's a good starter.  All right.  Let's take a break.  The phones are lit.  We don't have to. 
[02:50:30]  Let's just fucking move on to fun stuff.  Yeah.  What is that?  No, I mean, yeah, I got people.  We've done it.  Well, or we could take calls after break, whatever.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  All right.  Stay there.  I'm getting all giddy.  Chris Cornell, Soundgarden. 
[02:51:00]  Damn it.  What a voice.  And I did hear some inside information, by the way.  Yeah?  Yes.  What do you know?  I asked Chris Cornell.  Hey, we had that guy on our show a little while ago.  Look at him.  He's on Channel 5.  That guy.  Yeah, Chris Cornell called me and he said the Soundgarden's going to be doing some stuff.  It's all things music.  It's live performances, in-studio interviews, field pieces, some funny stuff here and there. 
[02:51:30]  And I have a co-host, Amy Schumer, who's out of her mind, probably has the foulest mouth  I've ever heard.  Oh, nice.  Even coming from Blink-182.  And, yeah, it's really fun.  All right.  Are you nervous about this?  I mean, this is something outside of your comfort zone, I think it's fair to say, right?  You haven't hosted a show before.  Are you ready?  You've been rehearsing?  We have been rehearsing.  I am not ready at all.  No way.  Come on.  Come on.  I mean, you guys know it's difficult to, like, you know, be in front of a camera and,  you know, as a band member talking about a band, it's easy. 
[02:52:00]  I can tell you anything you want to know about Blink-182, about music, about anything else,  but they don't have to move on to presenting something and reading from a teleprompter.  They had to, like, have an expert come in and teach me how to read a teleprompter.  But, you know, the right thing is that Fuse has really said, this is your guy's show.  Did you go ahead and teach them how to read a teleprompter?  I'm a good teleprompter.  I know you are.  They're amazing at it.  I saw you do it on Red Eye a couple of times.  They're just amazing.  Very good.  I did it on the Tonight Show the other night.  You wouldn't even know I was reading a fucking teleprompter the way I was.  Bang, bang, bang.  You're good at it. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, my fucking nickname is a teleprompter cube.  That was a little rough coming back from break because, I mean, he's live.  You're doing your Chris Cornell story.  We're all over the place.  What were you saying?  I talked to Chris.  You got inside info from Chris Cornell?  Yes.  I was in the Puel at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  What is he saying?  And I asked him, I go, what's going on with Soundgarden?  And he did say that they are together. 
[02:53:00]  They are kind of practicing.  And they're going to start playing some places locally in Seattle.  Not small clubs, but not big, huge places.  And then once they're done doing that, which he said they should start doing in about a month, they're going to tour nationally.  Told you.  That's what I heard from the horse's mouth.  Yes.  You know what I heard from the horse's mouth? 
[02:53:30]  Ow.  Could you get that bat out of my asshole?  I knew I was setting you up on that one.  You know what I heard from the horse's ass?  He had ice cream for vacation.  That bat hurt my hiney.  Probably didn't even blink.  You think Kenny would blink if you put a baseball bat in his ass?  That's all he would do.  Just one quick blink.  Just blank, blank.  Big blink.  And a little tear like fucking Denzel in Glory going down his cheek. 
[02:54:00]  Going down his dry cheek.  Oh, shit.  Fuck the Black Crows.  I need to see the Black Crows.  Anyway, sorry.  Hey, I just want to acknowledge that we lost a great comic there over the break.  Fuck yeah, Robert Schimmel.  Robert Schimmel was a great comic.  He did our show a few times.  Yeah, he was more of a Howard guy.  He did Howard on a regular basis.  But we certainly had Robert Schimmel on over the years.  And he died from injury, suffered in a car crash.  He beat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, I think. 
[02:54:30]  It's a brutal cancer.  He had a lot going on in his life, man.  Yeah.  There was a whole list of things he beat.  It's so fucked up that...  He lost a child to cancer, I believe.  His five-year-old son.  That happened.  Five-year-old son just...  And then he gets on a car wreck.  Yeah, so he...  Sight.  He was 60.  Are you shitting me, really?  Yeah, we're getting old, man.  We met a young Robert Schimmel when we flew down from Boston to New York for the...  I guess it was some kind of Grammys broadcast or something.  That was the first time we met him, hung out with him at the bar. 
[02:55:00]  He was just a great guy.  Really nice guy.  Real funny guy.  60.  60 years old, yep.  Jumping Jehoshaphat.  So...  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Shame.  Hmm.  I guess God just needed another comedian.  Who knows?  How many comics does God need?  Jesus Christ.  Really?  Enough already.  All the good ones, too.  Why does God need so many wrestlers?  Exactly. 
[02:55:30]  God has fucking really basic taste in entertainment.  Fucking dirty jokes in wrestling.  Kinnison's dead.  Fucking Carlin.  Pryor.  It's a perfect example of how much bullshit that is when you think...  When they have the eulogies and it's in church and the priest or whatever gets up there and  starts talking that shit.  And I guess the Lord needed a...  Yeah.  Did he need a fucking bricklayer?  What happened?  When Linda Lovelace died, I guess God needed a blowjob. 
[02:56:00]  It doesn't make any sense.  Whatever.  Oh.  Fuck it.  It was depressing to listen to Carlin knowing he's dead.  Yeah.  He was creeping me out.  Was it?  Yeah, because it's...  Not enough time gone by yet?  I just felt like he should still be alive.  He was 71, though.  Yeah.  He should have been alive, but, you know...  He survived a lot of heart shit over the years.  Yeah.  A lot.  But I heard a drop-off between his last special and the one before.  Still hilarious, all that, but you could hear there's a drop-off. 
[02:56:30]  His last one, the one where he was standing...  There was one that...  When was the last one?  When was the last one, 2006?  He did one after...  There was one where he looked really bad.  He looked heavy.  Yeah, yeah.  He was sluggish.  I think he had had some heart trouble then.  And there was one...  The last one, I thought, was better than the one next to the last one.  When did we meet him for the first time at NEW?  Right around the time we got fired.  I met him for the first time in 88.  You met him in 88?  Dude, I was at one of his HBO specials.  And you can see me.  I'm in the third row.  And there's brief cuts for me.  It's before I ever did stand-up. 
[02:57:00]  Are you rubbing it in?  Yes.  Because I was at the safety show?  But you can't really...  Son of a...  You can see every...  You can catch little glimpses of me.  And I was sober like a year and a half.  And I remember I went backstage.  I wanted to go backstage.  Suck as cock?  I would like...  I certainly would have.  Or maybe it was 89.  But I said to the guy...  37, I'm thinking.  Could I come back and meet George?  I'm a comedian.  And I had never been on stage.  But I lied.  And the guy's like...  All right.  Oh, wow.  He took me and this guy, Gary, I was with, back. 
[02:57:30]  And we stood backstage.  And fucking Carlin came back.  And he started talking.  He made fun of my name a little bit.  He talked to everybody in the dressing room.  And he signed my ticket.  I still have it somewhere.  Make fun of your name.  I told him my name was Jim Norton.  And he started shitting on me.  It's an easy name.  Yeah.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Who do you shit on that?  It's a basic name.  Yeah.  It's not like Jim Lipschitz.  You can do so much with that.  Yeah.  I can't think.  Oh, my God.  Wow. 
[02:58:00]  Wow.  All right.  Hey, we lost another hoarder.  Speaking of deaths.  Oh, God.  I was watching that fucking show last night.  Again.  I can't stop watching it.  Do you yell when you watch it?  I yell like a lunatic at the fucking TV.  Do you just yell, me, me, me, me, me?  Me, me.  Me, me.  All about me.  And then all I think is like how when the shrink comes over and they knock on the fucking  hovel door and then they're like, hi, I'm whatever. 
[02:58:30]  Mind if I come in?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just watch your step.  And the hoarder's laughing at his fucking disastrous house.  And the shrink is just coddling.  Let's take a look here.  Well, do they have to go through the maze to find the living room?  Yeah, yeah.  First of all.  That's what they're doing.  Go through the maze.  And it's like, oh, you certainly have a lot of stuff here.  Yeah.  Well, you know how it is.  Being a fucking psychopath.  That kid glove shit is horse shit. 
[02:59:00]  The door opens.  That's right.  I tweeted it last night.  Kid glove crap.  The door opens and they punch him right in the fucking face.  If this was last night.  It's all the same.  It is all the same.  The kitchen is always a disaster.  The bathrooms never work and they shit all over the floor.  They're disgusting pigs.  They're just, I mean, they are sick, but they are so self-centered in the extreme.  Yes.  And their self-centeredness is never addressed. 
[02:59:30]  Who gives a shit they're sick?  There was a guy on that night.  Cruz is no God.  Robert Schimmel's gone, but this hoarder continues to live.  If he was a hoarder.  Yes.  Oh, Robert Schimmel was?  I have no idea.  That's a weird twist.  He hoarded sickness.  He hoarded sickness.  Jesus.  There was a guy last night that he would hoard newspapers.  And he'd clip things out.  He opened up a paper from like the election.  The Bush fucking gore election. 
[03:00:00]  I was like, he says gore won.  He did.  And he's like, let me cut this out.  And he's telling his son that he collects like history.  It's like, I'm collecting history in newspapers.  And he's got stacks of fucking old newspapers in his house.  So get some gasoline, a match and end his fucking problem.  Um, the, the hoarder, uh, TLC is just getting the best shows hoarders and fucking, what's 
[03:00:30]  the other one with the other OCD?  This other woman.  And I think she was on hoarders too.  She feeds her cats.  Let's not talk about OCD.  And then it's too close to home.  I can't, yeah, we can't make jokes about OCD because that has affected my life drastically.  Okay.  Yeah.  You know, I'll play the part of one of these asshole listeners.  Shut up.  I thought it was hilarious that I had to fucking spend hours looking for the blue comb when  I was growing up.  Freaky eaters.  Hilarity for everybody.  Freaky eaters. 
[03:01:00]  How are you supposed to find a blue comb?  Oh my God.  I've told that story.  Why don't you just get another one?  When the blue comb went missing, man, all hell broke loose in my house.  Did everybody look for it?  Yeah, we did.  That and the tweezers.  Don't fucking lose the tweezers.  It's just little kids.  Now we have to fucking hunt down a fucking blue comb.  That's why I don't fucking comb my hair, by the way.  Really?  I haven't combed my hair in decades.  Why are we all suffering? 
[03:01:30]  With the dandruff?  Every once in a while, Kenny's got to brush off the dandruff off my...  Look, look.  Wearing a black shirt.  Dandruff.  Oh my God.  Because I haven't combed my hair in two fucking decades.  Dandruff.  Easy.  Two decades.  I haven't owned a comb since the blue comb days.  Trust me.  Yeah.  It's just too...  It's too much...  Too close to home.  But then everything will go back to normal after we found the blue comb, right?  No.  I don't think it does. 
[03:02:00]  Oh no.  It did.  Don't you hate the self-centeredness?  I fucking hated it growing up.  Enough.  Go get another fucking blue comb.  This show, Freaky Eaters...  Sorry.  Yeah.  What's that?  ...is an addiction show.  Nice.  These guys...  Like, this guy is addicted to eating cheeseburgers.  It's all he eats.  Good.  Fat fuck.  Let him eat them.  Oh yeah.  But he's...  Are they trying to save him?  But his wife...  Why do these shows have to have...  He lies to his wife about how many he has.  He's a food addict.  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  But why do these shows have to have the, we're going to try to save these people angle?  Fuck it.  We want to see this guy eat burgers until he drops dead of a murder attack.  We don't give a shit if he saves.  There was a woman last night that ate...  What's that?  ...French fries.  Those are all the boxes of cheeseburgers that he eats in, I think it was...  A year.  ...one year.  Wow.  He estimated...  How the fuck is the guy still alive?  He's like, oh, it's got to be five years.  And he's like, no, that's one year of your cheeseburger consumption.  Wow.  No kidding.  The woman last night with the fries, though, was hysterical.  She's just eats French fries.  And then they're trying to get her to eat carrots and other vegetables that are crinkle-cut 
[03:03:00]  like fries.  And she's eating it, crying her fucking eyes out.  She's just...  Like crying.  I was livid.  There's a weird thing with...  Like, compulsive overeaters...  But, like, Sam is a weird eater.  He really is.  I want to know what that's about.  There was something fucking...  It's texture.  Nah, but it's all baby food, though.  It's all baby food he eats. 
[03:03:30]  There's a texture thing that happens to people, though.  Yeah, they need the certain texture.  It doesn't even matter.  She couldn't even eat a baked potato.  Why talk to Sam?  You got Kenny right there.  Kenny and Sam are very similar.  Kenny doesn't eat much...  Kenny has a much more varied diet than Sam, though.  I don't know, man.  Much more.  I've always seen Kenny eat, like, steak and potatoes, right?  Yeah.  He doesn't eat anything...  Any vegetables.  You don't eat dessert.  Yeah, Kenny doesn't enjoy dessert.  I don't understand that.  It's some kind of self-punishment. 
[03:04:00]  I eat to live, not live to eat.  Do they have the psychologists on this show, Ant?  Yeah, they got the shrinks.  They come in.  I don't need that part in these shows.  One of the shrinks, their name is J.J. Virgin.  Maybe what?  Maybe we could get a lot of our old radio bits back  if we just try to help the people.  Fuck.  Let's do that.  Yeah.  That's what TV's doing?  Of course.  They don't give a shit if this guy... 
[03:04:30]  No.  ...drops dead of a heart attack.  Care less.  But they know the viewers would care,  so they make believe they're helping them.  Yeah.  Psychologist is long gone after they filmed that episode.  That cheeseburger guy, guess what?  I would assume he's still eating cheeseburgers.  Oh, he is.  Didn't they just find a hoarder dead,  like, under a pile of garbage?  That's what I'm leading to, Kenny.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  That's not a big surprise.  They always find these assholes dead.  Oh, that's how this started.  A pile of their own nonsense?  We found another hoarder dead.  Found dead in our home under a mountain of garbage. 
[03:05:00]  Like, a cadaver dog couldn't even find her at first.  That's how, like, smelly and fucking disgusting it was in there.  Yeah.  I have no mercy for them.  No.  I'm going to keep everything piled up.  Are you fucking asshole?  Cut the shit.  Clean up.  And then they have, like, fucking the crazy cat people that are hoarders,  and they got to have 50 cats roaming around.  Half of them are dead laying there.  Put a bunch of fucking wackos. 
[03:05:30]  Just cut the malarkey.  They are crazy.  Malarkey.  So, freaky eaters.  Any of these freaky eaters eating just nothing but salad?  Why'd they call it that?  Was pigs taken?  P-I-G-Z.  What are they dumping out?  Is this French fries lady?  That's all the French fries she's eating?  I thought that was incredibly lame.  You can show me all the fries in the world.  It doesn't make any difference.  This fry hill is 600 pounds of fries,  which is the amount that you eat in half a year.  When you extrapolate that out to your lifetime, 
[03:06:00]  44,000 pounds of French fries  puts you at risk for heart disease, diabetes,  but the one that scares me the most for you is cancer.  This is just words.  You're going to have to give me a little bit more than that.  Could you pause this for one second?  Here's how you respond to this fucking bitch.  God damn it.  I'm with you, Jimmy.  Go.  You're not going to have to...  Okay.  Go fuck yourself.  Keep eating fries, stupid.  Give her a French fry fist sandwich.  Just don't... 
[03:06:30]  Stop trying to...  Just punch her in the face  with a handful of fucking French fries  and say, here, eat until you die, bitch.  These are just words.  You know what?  You're right.  Eat yourself to death, bitch.  This was my life growing up.  Everyone else had to suffer  because of one fucking person.  Stop trying to save  these self-centered motherfuckers.  God bless you.  Especially when they present evidence like that  and that little brat goes,  well, you're going to have to... 
[03:07:00]  No, I'm not.  How about we don't make...  You don't make us pay your medical insurance...  Your medical bills then, fucking dummy.  As soon as you start going,  I don't give a shit what happens to you  and your stupid French fry addiction,  guess what?  Miraculously, a lot of these people  get a little better.  Yeah.  Figure that out.  You don't have to search  for the blue comb anymore.  Her crying is the best.  What a baby.  She's a brat.  Sweeping.  She's a brat.  Eat the fucking healthy food.  Play this.  It's broccoli.  Play this fucking thing.  I want a cunt.  ...seem to care 
[03:07:30]  because she doesn't believe  this is her fault  or that she has any choice  in changing the situation.  Look at her.  Your defensiveness tells me,  okay, here's another person,  here are another couple health professionals  telling me stuff  that I've already heard before  and it didn't work.  Is that how you're feeling?  I mean, like I said,  it's the same thing.  If you show Morphine Addict a dead body,  they're going to be like,  right,  I know my morphine addiction  is going to lead to death  and this is a waste of time.  I agree.  We agree on that.  That tells me just how fed up she is 
[03:08:00]  and how bad she is.  Can you pause this one more time, please?  This is why I hate these therapists.  None of them,  none of them will address  the self-centeredness.  None.  They're always acting like a person  is a victim fighting their way out  and not one of them will say,  this self-centered ass  will not respond to anything.  The coddling?  Fucking coddling.  The coddling drives me fucking nuts.  Tough love. 
[03:08:30]  Let's go with some tough love.  Yeah, don't give her any ketchup.  That tough love works.  You are tough.  There's no reason to be that harsh.  You think the whole world has to stop  so they can discuss her french fry addiction?  Yeah.  Oh, please.  You told her what you needed to say.  If a dump truck dumping fries on the lawn  doesn't move you,  fuck you.  Right.  Go eat fries till they fall to your cunt.  Well, that's how you talk to that lady.  You know what?  A, you're ugly.  B, keep eating fries 
[03:09:00]  until your pussy smells like fries  because you're so full.  The dramatic dumping the fries on the lawn  is stupid.  Exactly.  People starving.  There's people starving in Africa.  Right.  And we're wasting fries on this cunt.  Wasting fries.  How about you take those fries  and give them to homeless people  and say,  you see all these people eating?  This is how much you eat in your...  Oh, Jimmy, I saw the whole show.  They did.  At the end,  they just scooped them up off the lawn  and gave them to the homeless people.  They don't know the difference.  You know they had to do that. 
[03:09:30]  What?  They had to just scoop that up  and give it to fucking...  I would guarantee.  Or pigs ate it.  Something ate it.  They should.  Fuck her.  Fuck these hoarders.  Fuck everything else.  Oh, man, thank you.  I'm going to watch this show now, too.  Yeah, it's a good one.  What is it called?  Freaky Eaters?  Can we hear what she has to say?  The clip's almost over.  Yeah, I don't think they ever get back to her.  There's like four seconds left.  Oh, she's crying.  French fries.  You're doing exactly what she wants.  God, I hate her.  Everyone has to talk about 
[03:10:00]  the French fry addiction thing.  That's what she wants.  I can't eat broccoli.  I'm trying to get...  And then she puts it in her mouth  and she...  It's like a dick.  She's all...  Yeah.  You got to let people  kill themselves.  Wait.  Yeah.  Wow.  Used lad bag.  Are you mad at us, Rochester?  Going to play devil's advocate.  Oh, just let the bitch  eat whatever she wants.  Not everyone can be  one of the beautiful people.  Just let the miserable people  eat what they want 
[03:10:30]  and let them die alone.  Self-righteous do-gooders.  Oh, okay.  It's not even about  being a beautiful people.  It's about  people's fucking self-centeredness.  It's like,  let them make their own choices.  Especially when someone  is that belligerent  when you're reaching out to them.  Look, I...  Fuck her.  She might have a real problem,  whatever,  but the coddling,  because of how I was brought up,  drives me fucking insane.  Okay?  The coddling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what it is.  That's what I hate  about these shows. 
[03:11:00]  What about the mothers?  You've seen it on  some of these shows  where they help  the addiction alone  because they want  the love back from the kids,  so all of a sudden  she's the one  bringing the fries  to the woman.  Yep.  Or this girl,  whatever.  They're always fucking...  They have the enablers.  The enablers.  The families of the hoarders  are the worst,  especially the husbands.  Like, they live in this shit  because the wife  is going out  and buying crap  and stacking it up  and they're like,  you know,  we used to have a sofa  and, well, 
[03:11:30]  not anymore.  Fucking tell her.  Look, dummy.  How do you think that starts?  I'm hauling that out.  Because all relationships  start very well.  You think all of a sudden  she brought home something  and just put it in a drawer?  And just one thing?  Like one little thing  and you don't think  nothing of it?  I don't know.  There's different ways.  They always have this problem,  this one problem.  This one black guy  was talking to me.  He was a hoarder.  He had all shit  all over the place  and he's like,  well, you know,  my mama died 
[03:12:00]  and that's when everything  just fell apart for me.  I started collecting things  and I was like,  what are you doing?  Everyone's mom dies.  Pull yourself together,  you dumb fuck.  Everyone's dad dies.  It sucks,  but you get over it.  I enjoy a nice french fry.  Who doesn't, Kenny?  Right?  But you actually eat  the exact amount  every meal.  I'll have 17.3 fries, please.  Glide them up.  You're a hoarder  of uncomfortable moments. 
[03:12:30]  A hoarder of enemies.  Don't you have to eat your food  in a certain way?  Is that you  or is that somebody else I know?  Chick-fil-a has nice  waffle fries.  All right, that's fine.  By the way,  what I hate so much  about these people  is if they dump fries out  and she's like,  look, I'm trying,  but I'm struggling,  I'd have complete empathy.  Yeah, I agree with you.  But it's that cunt attitude  of these people.  Right.  It's like,  don't force them  to recover and get back.  Go fuck yourself.  Right.  I like Nathan's French fries. 
[03:13:00]  Do you?  Yeah.  I'm a big...  How about some freedom fries, bucko?  We're talking fries.  I'm a big steak fry guy.  Yeah, they're good.  I don't like the thin  little tiny little fries.  I need a fry  with a little meat on it.  Steak fries.  Gilly fries.  You like curly fries?  Yeah, I like curly fries.  I like worse French fries.  Guys, let me say,  I like all kinds of fries  except small fries.  I like...  Five guys cooks their fries 
[03:13:30]  in peanut oil.  Let's take a call  on French fries.  Five guys?  How come there's  so many guys  cooking together?  What, are they  living in one big apartment  or something?  I don't know, Chip.  It's weird, though.  Everybody's using oil.  Doesn't that...  They take it out  of the car or something?  Let's go to Alan  in North Carolina.  Alan?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  This is my wrench  calling up.  Hi, Alan Wrench. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, God damn.  That was bad.  I didn't miss you  during vacation break, Chip.  What's that?  I want to respond  to something  what Jimmy just said  about health care,  about how y'all  have to pay for  our slobbiness.  I work, I pay for my health care  and I am an obese person.  I'm close to 500 pounds.  And my insurance  will not pay  to help me lose weight.  I want to get the lap band,  not the gastrointestinal,  but the lap band 
[03:14:30]  to help me lose.  They won't pay it.  Well, they should.  That is ridiculous.  So where do we go  when we need help?  Honestly, I would suggest  that I've never been there.  Old Readers Anonymous.  That all costs money, though.  Old Readers Anonymous is free.  OA is free.  And I've never been there,  but it's a 12-step program  and it's free.  It costs absolutely nothing.  All I think you need  is just a desire  to probably eat better.  It's a free thing  to go to OA.  You should look it up.  If you really want to, 
[03:15:00]  you can, man.  Yeah, we...  Isn't that just calling  and talking about  when you...  Oh, he even sounds like that.  No, you go to...  You go...  Again, from what I understand  about it,  it's like you go to it  and you sit there  with other people  who are in the same  fucking boat,  strong-bottomed boat  as you are.  And you guys help each other.  It's free.  And to me,  it sounds like  it's the best way to do it.  Because I know people  who've had stomach surgery  and a lot of them  put the weight back on  because you're not changing...  Yes.  Yes.  You're not changing 
[03:15:30]  what the problem really is.  You're just changing  like the fucking...  The substance for...  You understand?  You're not changing  what caused you to eat  to begin with.  And by the way,  it's okay.  They pulled his radios  the second he was out the door.  He can't listen to the show.  Yes.  They cut off my service.  Did they really?  Before I even made it  down the elevator.  Okay, guys.  Try...  Look up OA, man.  Good luck to you, okay?  Thanks, Jimmy.  All right, buddy.  They marched Steve  out of this building  like he was a fucking convict,  by the way.  They always do that. 
[03:16:00]  Chill the fuck out.  They always do that.  You don't have to.  You should know  your employees.  Sorry.  I just remember that.  Mashed potatoes  ain't bad neither.  Love mashed potatoes.  Yeah.  With garlic, I stay with.  You like sweet potatoes?  I hate sweet potatoes.  Nah, not as good  as regular potatoes.  They're the healthiest  potatoes.  I don't like sweet potatoes.  And then you put  the marshmallows on them  or something? 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, my wife makes  a nice sweet potato.  Do you like it?  Yeah.  I hate it.  You ever have  cauliflower potatoes?  Or whatever cauliflower mash,  I guess it would be called?  No, I've never  eaten cauliflower.  It looks like delicious  mashed potatoes,  but it tastes like shit.  No.  Is it a healthy alternative  to mashed potatoes?  No.  Sorry.  This is going nowhere.  But I like  the hoarding shows.  Yeah, those are great. 
[03:17:00]  The hoarding shows,  the other thing.  And then I was also  watching I Survived.  Not a fan.  No.  Reenactments suck.  Yeah, but you know what?  Some of their amazing  stories, though.  Their stories are great.  Amazing stories.  Here's the problem  with the show.  The reenactments,  yeah, they suck,  but I guess they got  to do it.  And then they come back  from commercial  and recap everything  you've seen  every single time.  It's like, look,  I don't need the long  recap, but oh,  they got a shipwreck one  last night.  Oh, this woman 
[03:17:30]  and like four other  people, I guess,  were on a sailboat.  They hit a storm  and the boat sank.  They're in a little  plastic life raft.  And some of the guys  started drinking the  salt water and getting  crazy.  It makes you nuts.  Yeah.  And the guys like,  one guy's going,  hey, I see land over there.  I'm going to go to it  and get the pickup truck  and I'll drive  and we'll be OK.  And he just jumps  over the edge  and starts swimming.  Wow.  Fucking sharks 
[03:18:00]  pounded this guy.  No kidding.  They hear him  just start screaming  and he gets ripped apart.  Another guy did the  same thing, gets out,  just gets eaten right  under the boat they  were in.  She goes, this woman  is like, you can't  even imagine what it's  like to listen to  somebody being eaten  by sharks directly  underneath your plastic  little lifeboat.  Plastic lifeboats.  Yeah.  So they could have  poked through it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What would you do?  She felt the sharks  hitting the boat as  they were ripping this 
[03:18:30]  guy to pieces.  What would you do in  that situation?  Would you watch or  would you turn away  and plug up your ears?  You got to plug your  ears and not look.  I think you got to  watch.  So you don't remember  it forever and ever  and ever.  Wait, how many,  let me ask you a  question.  How many, how many,  how many people  were in the boat?  The two that went  for the pickup truck  obviously not included  them.  Yeah, well, two  survivors made it,  a woman and a guy.  Two men and a woman  died.  How long were they  at sea for?  Like four days. 
[03:19:00]  Wasn't even that  long when you think  about it, but it  was, yeah.  Yes.  Oh, similar story.  I had, I was on  boat on time that  turned over in the  ocean, but we was  out for, we was out  for a while before  we got rescued.  How long?  Five days.  It was, uh.  Oh, one more day  than this.  Yeah, but it was  like four people got  eaten by sharks  till same thing  happened.  Four people.  Yeah.  And how did you  get rescued?  I was just paddling  with my legs and  kicking the sharks and 
[03:19:30]  stuff.  and I grabbed  the fan and I  was like, homeward.  And the things  just swam back  there, you know?  It's amazing how  great Chip has  gotten at things  and Chip is,  Chip is a liar.  Chip has just  turned into a big  liar.  I was on my, my  yacht.  You had a yacht?  Yeah.  Nah.  My family did.  Oh, because you  probably came from  a wealthy family?  No.  Yeah?  How much money 
[03:20:00]  did your family  have?  Yeah, right.  Because these  people probably  had, I would say  probably a million  and a half.  Yeah, that's my  father said one  time we had  like, probably  like less,  somewhere between  like a million  and a half  and two million  dollars.  Oh, two million.  Okay, a little  more, a little  more.  That's always,  always seems to  be a little  more.  I hate Chip.  What happened  to the survivors?  Oh, yeah, yeah,  yeah.  Oh, they're  fine. 
[03:20:30]  They got rescued?  Yeah, they got  rescued by this  big freighter that  came by and one  woman actually died  from a leg  infection.  She got her leg  caught in the  rigging when they  were trying to get  to the lifeboat and  cut her leg up and  then it was just  because they were  all just laying in  piss and shit and  everything else in  the life raft.  Why can't you shit  over the side of the  life raft?  The shark's going  to bite your  ass?  Help everyone  out.  I guess after  watching those  fucking sharks do 
[03:21:00]  their business,  you're like,  yeah, let's just  leave the duty  here.  Yeah, fuck it.  I would have  fed it to the  sharks and they  wouldn't have  wanted to eat you.  And like she  couldn't, it was  her own shit because  she couldn't do  anything because her  leg was getting  infected.  And then she  just, she started  doing this thing  where she was like  doing some weird  hand motion things  and just gazing off  into the sky.  And then she  started speaking in  tongues and then  she just dropped  dead.  Saltwater?  No, she hadn't  drank saltwater.  In four days an  infection killed her?  Yeah.  I know.  I was watching this 
[03:21:30]  going, why does  fucking shit happen  fast?  That infection shit  could get you fast.  Why does the saltwater  make you crazy?  Is that worth a  Dr. Steve call?  It has something to  do with swelling of  your brain.  From the salt?  Yeah.  And it destroys your  kidneys.  Yeah, salt is, and I  don't want to move  past the life raft  shit.  You get some rules.  If you're going to  shit, you figure out  a system.  Yeah.  They were crazy  people.  Wait, were the  boats following the  sharks?  Why would you shit  and pee in the  life raft?  Because they had  drank saltwater and  they were going  crazy.  Well, that makes 
[03:22:00]  sense.  And they're just  pissing and shitting  all over infected  woman's leg.  Were the sharks  following them?  Yeah.  Yeah, the woman  was actually, she  said the temperature  was about 40  degrees, so they  were freezing, but  the water temperature  was 75.  So she just jumped  in the water and  was holding on to  the life raft just  to warm up a  little bit.  And she saw, she  looked down and  saw like these  tubes kind of  moving around, a  whole bunch of  them.  That's sharks.  And then she  looked out and  realized further 
[03:22:30]  away you could  see them in some  of the waves.  You know, as  sharks get in the  waves, you just  see like this  weird greenish  tinted.  And she was  like, fuck, got  back in the  life raft and  then they just  were circling.  And when the  first guy got  out, he's  like, I'm  swimming for  land, I see  land.  And she said  he started  swimming and  just heard this  horrible scream  when the sharks  grabbed him.  If I couldn't  believe it, the  asshole got out  of the boat.  Yeah, is it  really?  It's like, I  didn't ever get  out of this  thing.  Hey, look at  idiots.  A lot of people  saying the  shows, I  shouldn't be 
[03:23:00]  alive.  no, it  was called  I  Survived.  That's the  one I  watched.  All right,  because I  hear there's  two different  shows.  fucking  suck it.  They're saying  there's one  called I  Survived.  I was not  thinking death  ever.  I was  thinking life.  Do you  guys hear  that?  I'm just  thinking.  Give up  your fucking  asshole. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, they  had another  woman that  was her  husband put  a hit out  on her and  this hit man  comes to  kill her with  a hammer and  just bashes  her face in  with a hammer  and shit and  she's fighting  this guy off.  Finally, after  fighting for a  long time, she  got him in a  sleeper hold and  told him, look,  who the fuck  sent you for  me?  I'm going to  let you breathe  for a second and  let her arm go and 
[03:24:00]  the guy went to  grab the hammer and  nail her again.  Boom!  She put the  fucking sleeper  hold on him,  choked him out,  went back, went  over to the  neighbor's house,  they called the  cops, cops came  there, she had  killed him.  Wow.  He was fucking  dead.  I hope she  went to jail.  She should have  gone to prison.  She was so much  more upset that  she had killed  somebody than  anything that  happened to her.  He hit him with  a hammer.  Did her husband  want it to hit  done that way or  did he not  specify?  I guess he  wanted it done  with a hammer to 
[03:24:30]  her face.  Oh boy, maybe  she was cheating  on him or  something?  Who knows?  She didn't look  like the type that  could cheat.  She looked like  the type that  could give a  man, a hitman,  a chokehold and  kill him.  But how do  you fucking  kill, even if  you hate your  wife, how do  you hire someone  to fucking kill  her with a  hammer?  That's a brutal  way to kill  somebody.  Oh yeah.  A lot of  anger there.  Yeah, I know.  She must have  been a real  cunt.  Really?  What did she  do wrong?  What do you do  to inspire someone 
[03:25:00]  to want to pay  someone to murder  you with a  hammer?  A hammer.  Well, those  shows are, and  then there's a  fascination with  the midget.  Just a fascination  with midget on  TV.  Not anymore.  Now they got  my favorite show  Little People  Big World is  going away.  So whatever  there's done  with the  fucking midget  shows under  the radar.  There's all  kinds of  midget stuff. 
[03:25:30]  All right.  Now they got  that midget show  now with that  guy that's like  saves the dogs  pit boss.  And he's a  little midget  that goes around  with a bunch  of little midgets  and they make  sure dogs are  spayed and  neutered.  What do they  reach up and  grab the  testicles?  Rip them off.  He's actually  saving gerbils.  He doesn't even  know.  Because he's  small.  He's a little  guy.  Yeah, exactly.  And there's  another midget show.  Like, what's  this with the 
[03:26:00]  fucking midgets?  I didn't even  think there were  many left.  That's the  documentary that  Bynum McFarlane  and her  husband are  working on  it.  Hey, you  guys shit  outside?  I have.  I told you  when I was a  kid, me and  my friend Paul  McKay were going  to steal comic  books.  As an adult.  No, but that's  the only story I  have.  And I was  shitting.  I went to  shit outside and  I had satin  running shorts.  My dad satin  running shorts.  And I was  shitting outside and  yellow jackets were  flying between my  legs.  Oh, shit.  I had shit my  pants a little so I  had to wipe my 
[03:26:30]  ass with my  underwear and  then walk in my  satin shorts.  But bees were  flying by my  asshole.  Your aunt would  never shit outside.  Danny, you shit  outside?  I did.  I was in  construction.  I had to.  I shit outside  twice during  vacation.  Now people are  discussing if that's  weird or not in my  family.  Why did you shit  outside?  Well, we had the  beach house and  you know, you take  the car down to the  beach, get a nice  spot and I would  get up early.  There's no one on  the beach for real.  I would listen to 
[03:27:00]  some music, hanging  out, drinking coffee  and not have the  earth to shit.  So they're saying,  well, why don't you  just go back to the  house?  I'm like, that's a  big fucking hassle.  I'm already on the  beach.  How far was it to  walk back to the  house?  It's a honestly  five minute walk.  Jesus.  It's not that bad.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you're  right there and no  one's around.  I know that, but  what do you do with  the shit?  Well, this is the  story.  My hatch is up.  My brother could  even call and  vouch.  The hatch is up on  my vehicle. 
[03:27:30]  So I make believe  I'm doing triceps.  Oh, no.  You're doing like  dips?  Doing dips.  Make sure the ass  is spread nice.  Oh, no.  Because I want to  still hang out after  it's over.  Oh, no.  And I, you know,  I laid some pipe  into the sand.  Did you cover your  duty like a cat?  Did you cover it  like a cat?  With your feet?  Well, here's what.  I was going to do  that.  I really was.  There were tire tracks,  so it's perfect.  And I just brush over  that part of the tire  track.  No one's going to  know.  But then I start  looking around like,  oh, fuck, this is 
[03:28:00]  where we hang out on  the beach for the  entire day.  So this can't be  good.  It might start  smelling or someone  might step a little  deep in the sand.  Yeah, yeah.  So then I look in my  car and I see that I  got like a cardboard  box in the back.  So I take the two  like, and I make a  makeshift shovel and I  get the whole thing.  Nothing is left  behind.  Okay.  And I start  throw it in the  ocean.  And I start walking  toward the ocean.  And right at that  moment, my brother,  Scott, comes over the  dune.  He's enjoying his 
[03:28:30]  morning, too.  And he sees me throw  this into the ocean.  So now at this point,  what do you do?  It's my brother, so I  had to tell him.  Anyone else, I would  have came up with a  weird story.  He goes, oh, I  thought you were  throwing your egg  sandwich away.  I kind of was.  Yeah.  I've already used it.  What's wrong with  that?  Because what if  someone now has to  go swimming?  It's the ocean.  And it was Hurricane  Earl type ocean.  That shit was gone  within minutes.  You're right.  What's wrong with it?  What's wrong?  Like, as opposed to  the five-minute walk 
[03:29:00]  to the house, why  wouldn't you just  squat and shit into  a tire track and  then fucking make a  box and throw it  into the ocean?  Why wouldn't you  carry your own shit  on a box?  You've never camped?  What's wrong with  you guys?  Not five minutes  from my house.  It's a five-minute  walk.  I'm already set up  nice.  I got the music.  My car's there.  No one's going to  steal it.  I got the coffee.  You gotta take the  walk.  I got my very  very primitive  looking Kindle.  No, GH, what you  did is very commendable.  Do you shit  outside, Kenny?  I would shit 
[03:29:30]  anywhere.  I lived my life  through my asshole.  And someone goes,  I think you like  shitting outside.  I go, I guess,  but not in that  weird way.  What'd you wipe  with?  You gotta make  sure you spread  nice.  No, you didn't  wipe your hands?  There was some  damage back there,  but not enough to...  Oh, no.  You didn't wipe?  Well, usually what I  do next is I take  all my clothes off  and wipe in the  ocean.  With what?  Use your fucking  hand.  Oh, my God! 
[03:30:00]  Come on!  You go Middle  Eastern.  Yeah, that's  certainly easier  than going to the  house, shitting  and coming back  down ten minutes  later.  Why would you do  that?  Why?  Better to wipe  your ass with  your fucking  hand in the  ocean.  I'm so glad  you agree.  I can't.  That's not the  only one, though.  I did have  another one, and  I did do tire  track in another  area and just  fucking, you  know, put the  sand over the  tire track.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you  shit in the glove  compartment?  Get it later.  I had two.  Oh, I had two. 
[03:30:30]  You couldn't.  In a past  vacation, I, wow,  did anyone ask  for these stories?  No.  Oh.  Well, you're  delivering.  The mother-in-law  is going to hear  this for the  first time, fuck,  but there was  another vacation  where the mother-in-law  and her sister-in-law  went for a walk  down the beach,  and I was by  myself again, and  I just don't like  walking back to  the house when  I'm all set up  nice.  This time, I  decide I'm going  to do it in the  ocean.  Spread nice, 
[03:31:00]  squatted down,  and no problem,  and I was psyched.  I even was able  to do a little  washing of the  area.  How?  Well, you have  to take your  stuff off and  then go in real  fast, go for a  dip.  But the mother-in-law  and her assistant-in-law  come back from the  walk a little too  soon, and  unfortunately,  because the tides  were changing.  Oh, no.  Dude, it was  spread all over  the beach, and 
[03:31:30]  she's talking to  me, wondering  why there's so  many birds.  This is so  disgusting.  My shit was  spread along the  shoreline by the  big ocean waves,  and the birds  discovered it.  Were you in the gulf  recently?  And the birds  discovered it, and  they came a-common.  They came a-common,  whatever, and had a  little meal.  Let's see this  German bird. 
[03:32:00]  They were  feasting.  Feasting on your  shit.  Feast-easting.  And I'm trying to  kind of direct her  away from the  area.  Why?  You should have  pointed at it and  said, go see what  those birds are  eating.  That's what I  would have done.  I would have  sent somebody over  there.  Hey, what are  those birds eating?  Let's go take a  close look.  But I should have  looked at the  I should have  I should have  over there barefoot.  I should have  looked at the  tide charts, because 
[03:32:30]  I miscalculated.  The tide wasn't  coming in.  It was going out,  Anthony.  I could just  worst it up on  the shore.  You know what?  You need title  charts when you  take a dump.  Five minutes to  the house.  Oh, I love to  shit and have  seven birds eat  it and send  somebody right over  there.  with a camera.  Five minutes is  five minutes.  Come on.  Come on.  Space truck  comes in.  So, Kenny, you  really shit outside?  I shit in the  ocean once, but I 
[03:33:00]  swam out and was  treading water while  I was shitting.  We had another  incident with my  brother-in-law.  We were all hanging  out in the ocean,  Jersey Shore.  We're just kind of  hanging in the  way.  You had a  situation, Jersey  Shore.  Yeah.  Oh.  And I believe it  was Kenny, my  other Kenny in my  life.  He laid a log big  time and then it  started floating  toward us.  Oh, I didn't know  what happened to  mine.  I just had my  bathing suit around  my ankles and I  was kind of  treading water.  And shitting? 
[03:33:30]  And I shit.  I gotta try that  one.  Oh, God.  And then fucking  swam away.  I gotta try that  one.  Little cum bubbles  came up to the  fucking...  Can I try it in  your pool?  I'll make sure I  eat a lot of  fiber.  I would love to  shit in that  jacuzzi.  I wanna...  No!  No shitting in  my jacuzzi.  How bad do you  want to tread  water and try to  get a log out  now?  I couldn't shit  in the...  I pissed in  every fucking...  Every wet thing  in Anthony's  fucking yard I  pissed in.  Believe it,  that jacuzzi,  half of it is  me.  It's fucking... 
[03:34:00]  I just sit there...  You know I'm  pissing, can I  just stop talking?  I know when  at one point I  said, yeah, I'm  gonna go...  to the cabana  and take a leak.  And Jimmy goes,  you get out to  piss?  You don't even  piss in your own  shit?  If I had my own  pool and stuff,  absolutely.  I try to just  go, you know,  use the cabana  bathroom.  It's fucking  15 steps away.  I have peed in  every pool I've  ever been in.  Have you been in  a jacuzzi yet?  Have you been in  a jacuzzi?  No, it was still  being built.  It was still 
[03:34:30]  being built.  That's how long  it's been.  Thanks.  Really?  Why don't you  go into it?  Never been in  this pool.  After these  shit and piss  stories?  That is true.  Yeah, the pond,  the pool, the pond.  You see birds in  your yard?  Yeah.  Seagulls.  Tom and PA's  calling me a liar.  Whatever, douchebag  hater.  My brother will  back me up on  my shit story.  Trust me.  What did he say?  Is he kidding or  is he being serious?  He's probably being  serious.  I hope he's such  a liar.  Nope.  I shit twice on  vacation and I shit 
[03:35:00]  that other time down  in the Outer Banks.  At least.  At least three under  my belt.  At least.  Dude, I can think  of a couple, but  like none, like  camping is one  thing, but if you're  five minutes, I  couldn't do it if I  was five minutes  in the house.  It's about five, but  getting down to the  beach with all your  stuff and then you  look around, no one's  around.  You know you're  going to take a  shower when you get  home or go in the  ocean, so you know  you're going to be  all cleaned up nice.  I shit once behind a  bush on the Staten  Island Expressway.  There you go.  Jimmy was in the car. 
[03:35:30]  We were driving to  Kennedy Airport one  early morning.  I wasn't in the  car.  Was I really?  Yeah, Happy Face's  girlfriend was driving  us.  Me, you Happy Face.  She was driving  We became known as  the Lufthansa shit.  No, I think you just  told me about that.  I thought you were in  the car.  Oh, maybe I was.  That was before him  and she got married?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I think she was  driving us all to the  airport.  I could have sworn you  were in the car.  I remember hearing  that story.  I don't know if I was  there.  Maybe I was.  It's familiar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And early morning shit,  you know, comes with  urgency.  Behind a bush? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, it was like  they were like building  an on or off ramp or  something and it was a  bush that I just  squatted behind the  bush and I had some  napkins.  Are you embarrassed?  No.  Believe me, I would go  anywhere.  I got a spastic colon.  Nobody believes me.  Oh, we believe you.  Spastic colon.  Colon's learned to  react.  It's just punching  because there's so many  dicks.  All right.  Here we go.  I'm tired of it.  Here we go.  We got Carl in  Maryland. 
[03:36:30]  Carl.  Hey, I love the show  and Sirius better do  the right goddamn  thing, by the way.  However, your story  kind of made me laugh  because this weekend  I'm outside.  I'm getting ready to  paint my house and  it's pouring down  rain.  So I'm going around.  Why were you painting  the house?  Was Mr. Miyagi  training you to fight?  Shit depends.  I was going around  fixing some stuff up  around the house 
[03:37:00]  and I had to take a  shit.  Well, I'm soaking wet  and I didn't want to  track rain through the  house.  So I go in my garage.  I go around the side  of my house.  I break off about  four paper towels,  lay one down,  squat,  take a nice,  let's just say,  almost diary,  diarrhea shit  on these paper towels.  Probably the biggest  load I've ever  dumped  and have to 
[03:37:30]  pick it up now,  wipe my ass  with the paper towels,  pick it up  and put it  in a Ziploc bag  and it's now  sitting in my garbage.  There you go.  So you were five  minutes away?  Yeah.  I was about 50  steps away from my  toilet.  See, people understand  and they're confused  by the five minute  walk if you have a  beach house.  If you know the  Outer Banks,  I was second row in  unfortunately.  Didn't get the  official ocean front  although we could  see the ocean.  Well,  that's why the  five minute walk  because people are 
[03:38:00]  now calling me out  on the five minute  walk.  Jesus,  enough.  All right,  man.  Brother man,  brother man,  vodka.  Take care,  guys.  Coming soon.  Man,  you've never  shit outside.  Oh,  no,  you said you did.  I shit construction.  I'd have to,  but I used  spackle bucket  and I had  toilet paper  in the truck.  So you had no  choice?  I had no choice.  You had a five  minute walk.  No choice.  If I had a  five minute walk  to a toilet 
[03:38:30]  instead of a  spackle bucket  even though I  had toilet paper.  Let's go with  this then.  Ten minute walk.  No choice?  Spackle bucket  and toilet paper.  No,  no,  no,  no.  Beach,  five minute walk.  Beach,  ten minute walk.  No choice?  I would ten minute  walk,  not without.  Fifteen minute walk?  I'd hold it.  No,  it's a whole thing.  I'd hold it.  I gotta use  toilet paper  and fucking  have some kind  of sanitary  You gotta get  one with nature. 
[03:39:00]  One with nature?  You gotta shit  in a hole.  You haven't lived  until you shit  in a hole.  That's so  disgusting.  Oh,  good.  Yeah,  I can't.  Friend did a  meet.  Oh,  wait,  let me say  hi to Len in  Buffalo.  Hi,  Len.  Hey,  how you doing,  guys?  All right,  Len.  I'm thrilled to be  part of the  September shit show.  Yes.  A friend of mine  was on her  first meet 
[03:39:30]  the parents  date.  And she's  in the living room  of this house,  huge house  in Buffalo.  She hasn't  taken a shit  in three days.  She finally  has the urge  while she's  sitting there,  goes in a little  under the stairs  bathroom,  takes a shit  the size  of a small  baby.  Thing doesn't  want to go  anywhere.  She doesn't  know what to  do.  There's no  window,  nothing in  the bathroom.  So she  takes it  out of the  toilet,  uses the  entire roll  of toilet  paper to  wrap the  thing up  and mummify  it, 
[03:40:00]  and sticks  it in her  purse.  And waits  until they  get to the  movie theater  after the  meeting and  talks with  the waste  in her  bathroom.  Put it  in her  purse,  Ant.  Shit in  the purse.  Put it  in the  purse.  And then  for her  birthday that  year,  we bought  a purse  and filled  it with  fake dog  shit wrap  and toilet  paper.  Beautiful,  wonderful.  You like  shit stories?  They're  disgusting. 
[03:40:30]  Shit stories.  Let's say  hi to Lenny  in Chicago.  Lenny.  Hey,  guys.  You ever  shit outside  when you  were talking  to George  about  tending  rabbits?  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey,  Lenny.  Lenny,  have you  I saw  what was  it?  What's the  other show?  Not how  is it  made,  Danny.  What's  the other  one?  How do  they do  that?  Fuck,  I was  watching a  marathon.  I'm so  goddamn hooked  on that  show now.  Yeah,  that's a  good one.  How it's  made is  amazing,  but how 
[03:41:00]  they do  that's  even  better.  Learn how  shit works.  And they  were talking  about the  glass boxes  in Chicago.  It used  to be the  Sears Tower.  What is it  called now?  Willis.  Willis.  Willis.  And you  go,  what,  a hundred  something  stories up  and they  have glass  boxes now  that you  can walk  out onto?  So it's  like you're  just floating  out there.  And the  people can't  do it.  Their minds  get so  fucked up  they can't  walk out  into the  glass box.  Or they  could do  it for  like a  split  second  and run  back in.  And the  guys were  explaining  engineering  wise how  sturdy  these things 
[03:41:30]  are and  what it  would actually  take to  break through  either the  floor or the  walls of  these things.  But I want  to do this  now.  You've  done it?  Dude,  I got  photos.  I've sat  in it and  I'm a  terrified  guy.  Are you  freaked out?  Kenny,  hold on  Lenny,  I'm sorry  we're doing  a little  tangent.  I may  have the  pictures  here.  I went  up with  Kenny  and I  was doing  Chicago  one time  because I  wanted to  try to  conquer  it.  I'm still  afraid of  heights.  I think  it's called  the CN  tower I believe  in Toronto  has something  sort of 
[03:42:00]  like that.  It's just  a glass  floor.  You walk  across it  and you  watch people  all day  long just  running  across it.  They can't  handle it.  But to be  actually in  a box where  what three  out of the  four sides  are nothingness.  Yeah,  that's got to  be a little  got to be  unbelievable.  It goes  against  everything  your mind  instincts  tell you.  What were  you feeling  Jimmy?  Anything?  Mortal  terror.  Really?  It's  horrifying.  Why though?  Because you're 
[03:42:30]  a thousand  feet in the  air with  nothing.  It's  terrifying.  What if  they told  you could  run as  hard as  you can  into the  wall and  you wouldn't  go through  it?  I knew  you could.  I believed  it and  I knew  it but  it didn't  matter.  There's a  shot of  it.  Look at  that.  That's  unbelievable.  At  first,  dude,  at first  I couldn't  fucking  hold on,  I'm finding  it.  I have a  lot of  photos here.  But at  first I  couldn't  even do  it.  Kenny,  remember I  was just  hovering  against 
[03:43:00]  the  wall and  I wasn't  going to  go out?  He was  very squeamish  for like  five minutes.  Did you do  it,  Kenny?  No,  I was the  photographer.  You didn't  want to do  it.  Were you  scared?  I think I  did it.  Yeah,  you did  actually.  You took a  picture of  me out  there.  From one  box to  the other,  right?  Yep.  That's what  two women  say when  they're  talking.  Hold on.  Here's  a...  I got to  see the  picture.  Yeah.  The first  one...  Fuck,  I want to  do this  now.  I've never  been to  Chicago.  I want to  take a little 
[03:43:30]  fall trip to  Chicago.  Here's  me.  The first  one is me  just scared.  I couldn't  do it.  You got a  picture of  you just  being a  little scared,  Jimmy?  That's your  feet?  That's Kenny's  feet.  This way,  right?  No,  other way.  Okay,  hold on.  Oh,  my God.  Now,  keep going.  Oh,  my God.  That's how  high up you  are.  How high  is that?  You should  tweet these.  I have.  Okay.  What is  that?  Is that a  dude or 
[03:44:00]  a chick?  Oh.  Oh.  Get it?  Jimmy's  sitting there.  Are you  sitting?  Oh,  there's a  better shot  of it.  Are you  sitting in  there?  Yeah.  You look  like you're  in midair.  You don't  even see  the glass.  You look  petrified.  You look  really scared.  They explain  on the show  how they  like to  keep the  glass nice  and clean  too,  you know,  for the  full effect.  This is  how high  up we  were.  Yeah,  that's  unbelievable.  Wow.  I want to  do that so  bad.  There's a  thing,  like a  glass  bridge.  Grand Canyon 
[03:44:30]  and Niagara  Falls has  it.  Yeah,  that's  becoming the  new thing.  I would  love to do  the Grand  Canyon walk.  You have  to walk  around that.  Yeah,  it's like a  horseshoe  kind of thing  that sticks  out over  the rim.  Wow.  I love  that.  That's a  cool shot,  right?  But you  look so scared.  Look at your  hands.  You can see  that you're  bracing yourself  or something.  Dude,  I was  trying to  protect  yourself.  I was  mortified  being up  that high.  I'm afraid  of heights. 
[03:45:00]  And to  sit that  high,  like,  you're  basically...  Your whole  body...  How do you  explain it?  It tingles?  What's that  feeling?  You know  what I  mean?  It's a  horrible  fear.  Can you explain  that fear?  Horrible  fear,  dude.  It just  got the  goosebumps,  the  heebie-jeebies.  Because you  literally,  like,  stepping out  there was  horrifying,  but then I  just finally  just walked  out.  Oh,  my God.  And it  is fucking  scary.  I wish the  thing just  would have  cracked off  the side  of the  building.  Dude,  that would  have been 
[03:45:30]  awful.  Just to  fuck with  tourists,  they should  have,  like,  some kind  of sound  coming from  somewhere.  Oh,  yeah.  That would  be funny.  We used  to get  high in,  wow,  I'm telling  a lot of  stories today.  Geneseo.  What was the  fucking lake?  I lived on  the lake in  the middle of  winter.  That fucking  ice froze  nice.  Lake Minnetonka  in purple  rain?  We'd get  high walk  in the  middle of  it and  you could  hear the  ice cracking  in the  middle of  the night. 
[03:46:00]  It would  freak you  the hell  out.  You  weren't  walking on  it,  right?  Yeah,  yeah,  we were  in the  middle of  the lake.  That's  fucked up.  Well,  they said  the ice  was,  I don't  know how  many feet.  It  seemed like  it was  safe.  But you  would hear  the cracks  and then  it would  like,  or that  might be  the pod  talking.  Little  echoey  cracks  underwater.  boxes have  six sides,  not four.  I know,  I was  talking like  two  dimensions.  Oh,  please. 
[03:46:30]  So five  out of the  six sides  were glass.  Yes.  Two.  Okay,  so you know  what,  yeah,  you're right,  I guess.  Five out of  six.  You're  absolutely  right.  Scary.  Fuck that.  let's say  hi to  Jimmy  J.  Hey,  JJ.  Yeah.  We lose  to JJ.  Hello.  Hello.  If JJ's  not there,  I say  we go  home.  Hello.  Hi,  JJ.  Fuck.  You know  home  for you. 
[03:47:00]  What?  Ah,  say that.  Dude,  that's,  that's  fucking,  that's  telling  right there.  JJ was  calling  because he  wanted to  tell people  I'm going  to be  at Marco  Island  September  23rd  25th  and  off  the  hook  and  Foxwoods  in  Connecticut  October  14th  through  16th.  Thank  you,  JJ.  You're  thinking  all the  pools  down  there,  they play  Marco  Island.  Oh,  God,  I hope  not.  That's  their big  sport.  Oh,  God,  I hope  not.  I went 
[03:47:30]  for a  horrible  joke,  but I  bet you  they do  that.  I bet  there's  some  fucking  horse  shit  family  that  plays  Marco  Island  all  day  long.  All  day  long.  Canisius,  thank you,  Sarah.  Yes,  Canisius Lake.  I lived on  Canisius Lake  for a little  while.  Yeah,  I lived  there too.  Bought a  car with  my roommate  that broke  down a week  later,  so then we  were stranded  out there  because people  didn't really  feel like  picking us  up.  We probably 
[03:48:00]  had shit  on your  ass and  your hands  and the  tire tracks  and the  halfway  frozen to  the lake  like messy.  the  log  desk  monster.  I like  living on  the lake.  I like  taking those  long walks  into the  middle of  the lake.  Take a  big shit.  I love  walking on  frozen lakes.  Invite me  to walk on  your frozen  lake,  please.  Especially  when it's  black ice  and it  looks like  it's not  frozen.  Love it.  I gotta  pee.
