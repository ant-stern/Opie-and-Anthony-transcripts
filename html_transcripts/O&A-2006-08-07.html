<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, referring to themselves with derogatory terms like "dopes," "lewd," and "retards," while discussing their "O&A Traveling Virus" comedy tour.  They recount chaotic experiences, including unruly fans and staff misbehavior.  Their Worcester, Massachusetts show at the "crap hole" DCU Center is a major focus, detailing a free IHOP breakfast that attracted a large, unruly crowd.  Despite this, ticket sales were surprisingly good, even considering their recent return to Massachusetts radio.  They also discuss their strained relationship with the Boston mayor, whom they believe is hindering their preferred venue choices.

Numerous tour anecdotes follow: a contentious WBCN meeting where staff portrayed them negatively; a venue's refusal to sell James Norton's offensive "It's not rape if she blinks twice for yes" t-shirts; and a lengthy, vulgar comparison of venue merchandise cut percentages to "rape."  A significant portion covers a van accident caused by a very drunk staff member, Danny, exceeding a parking garage's height limit, resulting in damage and costly repairs to the van decorated with the hosts' faces.  They also recount a bartender at "The Irish Times" stealing money from their brother, causing a mass exodus of fans from the bar.  Listener calls detail embarrassing encounters with the hosts and comedians like Rich Voss, often involving awkward or inappropriate photos.  The hosts also discuss a backstage video featuring themselves and Rich Voss, culminating in James Norton's completely nude surprise appearance, and its upload to their website and YouTube.  The video's editing is discussed, notably a Foundry Music logo obscuring Jimmy's buttocks.

The show features performances by Patrice O'Neal, Bob Kelly, Bob Saget, and Tracy Morgan, all receiving praise.  Further anecdotes include Tracy Morgan's alleged hotel expulsion and other mishaps.  A significant portion is dedicated to Star, a recently fired and arrested radio DJ, who discusses his arrest, his unapologetic attitude, and his legal battle with councilman John Liu, accusing Liu of political opportunism. Star defends his controversial on-air comments as "hood talk," not inciting violence.  The conversation involves crude language and jokes, including discussions about "Stalker Patty," a hotel employee whose overly friendly behavior and alleged prostitution are detailed.  Stalker Patty herself calls in, corroborating and adding to the stories.

An in-studio interview with actress Kristen Bell follows.  While initially awkward, the conversation covers her career, kissing scenes (including one with a porn star), and her role in *Pulse*, detailing the differences between the American and Japanese versions and filming in Romania.  The hosts interject with tangents: a naked shower video, Anthony crying, Jimmy's encounter with Kate Beckinsale, and speculation about Opie's ancestry.  The show features interactions with fans outside the studio, a discussion about a listener named Jimmy and his Paltalk friends, and the possibility of impromptu studio tours.

Vulgar, sexually explicit banter follows, including jokes about sex, sexuality, and bodily functions.  John Valby's comedy performance is discussed, leading to further sexually charged jokes and a discussion about Breathe Right nasal strips.  A sexually explicit song is mentioned, alongside a humorous bit about a host's musical ineptitude.  A listener's critical review of a previous show is read, addressing various shortcomings, including a segment the host admits "sucked."  The review also criticizes a comedy show appearance featuring Patrice O'Neal, Bill Burr, and Tracy Morgan.  The conversation turns to the women photographed with Mel Gibson, escalating into sexually vulgar mockery.  The show ends with more offensive humor, listener interaction, a listener's anecdote about a car fire, and further vulgar jokes.

A later segment begins with a discussion about a Mel Gibson audio recording from a nightclub, leading to an unproductive interview with two women who were there, filled with insults directed at the women and Gibson. The conversation abruptly shifts to Joseph Blum's finger-biting incident, recounted by a caller.  The van accident is again discussed, with interviews of those involved, including "Happy Typing Girl," featuring conflicting accounts and accusations of intoxication.  A heated exchange ensues regarding the hosts' policy forbidding video recordings of the show and the subsequent deletion of attendee videos.  The show ends with a discussion of a bizarre watermelon-eating video by Petey Green and further offensive language and casual racism.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  In the country, creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's begin.  Everybody back?  Everybody back in New York?  Holy, holy crap. 
[00:01:30]  Holy crap.  Back from the road, man.  That's right, man.  Man, back from the road.  It's a tough old life on the road, man.  Did a little road trip, did we?  Back in New York City.  It has been a while since we've taken to the road.  Nice, man.  Nice, though.  Fun.  Exciting.  A lot of stories get conjured up when we take to the road. 
[00:02:00]  There's little factions.  And then we all get together and tell our little stories.  Little tribes come together under the wigwam and tell us stories of tragedy, stories of happiness, stories of a-holes.  And we got pictures.  Yeah, pictures.  And we have video.  Sound.  So the next few days are going to be very interesting for the Opie and Anthony show.  I cannot imagine a larger collection of jackasses than the people that travel around with us. 
[00:02:30]  The fans, some of the staff, us, just cannot conduct themselves like civilized human beings or just stay out of trouble or just not bother me.  All right.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:03:00]  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  For the new listeners out there that don't have a clue, we had our first O&A traveling virus.  Yes, we did.  The comedy event of 2006.  We played Worcester at the DCU Center up there in Massachusetts.  And it was just a huge success.  Huge success.  The reviews are in.  And I believe it's well over 90% positive.  Yeah.  Well over 90% positive.  And for the first one, we are very, very happy. 
[00:03:30]  The shakedown.  The test flight.  I really didn't think it would be as good as it was.  Through the whole thing, everybody was saying, oh, my God, this is going so well.  Yeah.  I can't believe this is going.  And I just kept saying, shut up.  You're going to jinx it.  Something's going to happen.  Well, we actually decided to organize something.  Yeah.  Over the years, we've been known for our road shows where we just show up somewhere, just  make sure there's enough beer, and then we just make up crap as we go along. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Just hop on the stage, drag people up from the show, and screw around.  Don't really have anything to say.  It's just pretty much, you know, hey, remember this guy?  You throw him up on stage kind of a thing.  Yeah.  We organized this one.  Yeah.  And we had a production team and everything.  A schedule.  We had a schedule we had to follow.  Schedule.  Yeah.  It was a lot of fun.  It was unbelievable.  E-Rock's working on the pictures from our Boston trip, including our day at BCN.  And after our BCN show up there in Boston on Friday, we decided to buy breakfast for 
[00:04:30]  about 100 or, I don't know, maybe a couple hundred listeners, I guess, at IHOP.  There were a lot less when we left the BCN parking lot than when we got there.  Yeah.  And it was only a few blocks away.  Yeah.  I think people just started following.  They heard they were going to get a free breakfast and started following us like the  Pied Piper.  Yeah.  It was a nice crowd.  We walked at IHOP, I'm looking at some of the pictures because E-Rock's working on  them right now to get up on opianthony.com. 
[00:05:00]  And there's a nice picture of us, me, you, and Jimmy around a round table broadcasted live  from IHOP as our listeners are enjoying a free breakfast.  Ah, yes.  So it was just...  Aren't we nice?  It was just crazy.  It's good to be back home.  My voice is kind of coming back.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  You just lose your voice.  A little beat.  Where the hell do we begin?  Listen, the O&H album Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  We got three or four more dates.  All the info is up on opianthony.com. 
[00:05:30]  Next stop, PNC Arts Center in Jersey.  Oh, yeah.  And ticket sales are crazy.  It turned out in Worcester at the DC Youth Center, we did about 6,000 people.  Yeah.  I'll be honest with you.  I thought we would do a lot better.  But it wasn't a bad showing considering we've only been back on regular radio in Massachusetts  for like 90 days.  We would have also if we were closer to Boston.  Yeah.  Well, we got kicked out of Boston.  The mayor's holding a grudge, so we couldn't play the Tweeter Center where we wanted to  play because this is definitely an outdoor show. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  This works much better as an outdoor show.  Maybe the mayor should worry about keeping the big dig from falling on people's heads  and stop holding a grudge against the radio show.  There you go.  How about that?  Big dig.  I was reading the Sunday papers on the way back to New York yesterday.  He doesn't even have a staff.  He doesn't even have like a chief of police and all those people you need.  Homeland Security doesn't have a top dog for that.  That's obvious.  He doesn't have a school, what is it called?  A super...  Chancellor.  A chancellor, whatever the biggest... 
[00:06:30]  Chancellor.  The biggest job in the school thing is.  He doesn't have any of those people?  Doesn't have any of those people?  No.  What, he's just been like walking around being the mayor without any staff?  The papers are pretty much saying he hasn't had a farm system for new talent and a lot  of these guys have moved on and he hasn't filled the positions.  He is really a bad mayor.  And then he's got this tunnel where now people are dying because it wasn't constructed right.  But he's going to make sure he keeps us out of Boston. 
[00:07:00]  Make sure it's very hard to get permits signed so we can do our stupid comedy show.  Because that's important.  And that's important.  If you're driving through one of these tunnels and a huge plate pancakes your car, that's  nothing big.  Right, right.  We're an ass.  So instead we moved it out to the DCU Center in Worcester and they were great at the DCU Center.  I mean, it's a crap hole.  Oh, yeah.  It is a crap hole.  DCU Center is a dump. 
[00:07:30]  Worcester in general, they're trying to revive.  Are they?  But, yeah, you saw some construction projects, but it's like, I don't know.  I don't know.  It's like duct taping an old car or something.  I don't know what I saw.  I think what I saw, Albany.  That's what Worcester is.  It's Albany.  I said like some parts of Buffalo that we had seen.  Yeah.  Like the impoverished parts.  Yeah.  That was pretty much it.  And then we get to the hotel in Worcester. 
[00:08:00]  The nicest hotel in Worcester.  The nicest hotel in Worcester was like just pretty much a crap hole.  It wasn't that bad, but it was just, you know, a basic.  Did you sleep in yesterday?  Lodging hotel.  I didn't leave until about one.  I was having the buffet with all the other listeners.  The whole hotel was filled with O&A listeners.  It was infested with pests.  Yeah.  Well, they all were, you know, they traveled to go to the show and they needed a place  to stay and they all decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza like we did. 
[00:08:30]  It was like a block away from the venue.  And so we're eating some buffet and you hear a rendition of the Lion King happening.  Just the Lion King was happening in one of the banquet rooms, I guess.  And then they had some kind of like Baptist ceremony going on.  Well, the Baptist church was across the street.  Across the street?  It was in our hotel.  Was it?  I heard them singing.  Because I heard the bells chime out over there. 
[00:09:00]  And they were awful.  That's what you get some nice singing out of a Baptist church.  Not in Worcester, man.  They were out of tune.  I noticed there were a lot of black people were in the hotel and around that area.  It seems to be a very urban part of Worcester that we were in.  And I just got to say, my girlfriend blurted out one of the funniest racist jokes I ever heard  when we walked out of the balcony and overlooked a lot of black people in the pool. 
[00:09:30]  I won't repeat it, but it was a very funny racist joke.  Jesus.  I think you could figure it out.  So the pictures are going up from our Boston trip, as we speak, opianthony.com.  And let's mention, when we get to the DCU Center,  remind me to talk about the shirt that I couldn't sell there.  Yeah, let's do it.  I mean, firebomb that dump.  The smorgasbord of what happened is what we're going to do.  For the first part of the show today.  Yeah, we got Boston trip highlights, starting with BCN after show. 
[00:10:00]  We had to meet the sales staff up there at BCN and clients and stuff.  So they threw a little lunch together for us.  And then Keith the Cop told everyone he went into the conference room  and made an announcement that you and I needed the head seats at the table.  It was one of these big meetings with a bunch of clients and everything.  And we're supposed to go in there and put on the happy face and shake hands.  And it was cool. 
[00:10:30]  We had a good time.  But Keith goes in beforehand and tells everybody, no, you can't sit there.  It's a huge, huge conference table.  One chair at one end, one at the other.  And he told everybody, make sure no one takes those seats,  because Opie and Anthony like sitting at the head of the table.  And they don't want anybody else taking these seats.  And everyone thought he was serious, because he put on the whole serious thing.  And then we walk in, and now we're instantly like prima donna idiots to these people.  You know we are.  It's like, oh, okay, they're these kind of guys. 
[00:11:00]  He also said, you like being that far apart because you like to yell at each other during meetings.  Yeah.  Yeah, so we need to be as far away as possible, or it could get a little touchy.  And they all bought into it.  Apparently one dude was sort of inching a little too close,  and he had to be like, no, no, no, you're getting too close.  We're so close.  We're kind of sitting like at the corner of a table.  Yeah.  Next to each other.  People shocked.  I'm hearing through the instant feedback here.  There are already pictures online at WBCN.com.  So those are the pictures they took. 
[00:11:30]  Our own people took pictures, and they're going up on OpieandAnthony.com.  There's going to be thousands of pictures from the weekend.  Lots of pictures.  Up on all the fan sites.  Lots of video, audio.  Right.  So then, I mean, well, Jimmy, talk about the shirts.  Of course we have merch.  We sell merch.  We got some merch, man.  Traveling virus shirts.  I have my own shirts I sell, my stupid expressions on them, like, you stink, I don't like you.  That type of crap.  One of the shirts I sell is from something I said a long time ago in the year, years ago. 
[00:12:00]  It's not rape if she blinks twice for yes.  Which is hilarious.  Granted, that's a little tasteless, but, you know, it's kind of true.  And, you know, it's good to give a shirt like that to your girl because she'll go, oh, you goose.  And you've said it in your act, I believe.  Probably, yeah.  I've seen you say that from the stage.  Oh, am I?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's part of, you know, it's part of you.  Yeah.  It's part of what you say.  It's part of your comedy.  And it's got my name under it.  And on the back, it's got my website.  And they were selling all the shirts, you know, and everything else.  But that's the one thing they wouldn't sell because they can't endorse rape. 
[00:12:30]  It's not endorsing.  Of course it's not.  It's a T-shirt with a, you know, saying on the front.  So to whoever...  Offensive, but...  Yeah, I don't...  Well, it's funny.  They don't have a problem serving alcohol, which is pretty much the thing that causes 90% of the rapes.  I mean, you know, you get loaded.  You get your face smashed into the passenger seat while your drunken date attacks you and you're trying to throw up out the passenger window.  They don't mind selling booze.  That's fine.  You get drunk.  You drive into a family.  Oh, sorry.  None of you can walk anymore.  Not our problem. 
[00:13:00]  Get everybody loaded and get them back into their cars.  That's fine.  But don't sell...  You want to talk about rape?  I'll tell you what rape is.  Rape is where the venue has to take 30% of the money you make on your merchandise.  That's rape.  That's the unions.  Huh?  It's the unions.  I understand.  But we're supposed to just sit here and go, oh, that's the unions?  Disgusting.  Someone explain to me why they get 30% to sell your stuff.  You show up with your stuff.  You can even sell your own stuff with your own people.  I'm going to lose my voice.  I have no voice left. 
[00:13:30]  You can't touch the money.  They won't let you behind the merch booth.  And they get mad if you get anywhere as close to the merch booth.  You know why?  Because they're greedy scumbags.  Yeah.  Who was that woman that was getting all uptight over the fact that we wanted to pull a couple  of tables aside.  So we can meet our listeners after the show.  People wanted us to sign stuff after they bought it.  So we needed a table set up and some kind of organization, a line being formed.  So we grab a table next to where they were selling shirts. 
[00:14:00]  And this woman just lost her mind.  You can't do this.  You can't be back here.  You can't.  We were like, shut up.  Shut up.  Just let us stand here.  These are people that paid money to come in here.  And we're going to sign their stuff.  Yeah.  You want to.  Why should you get a piece of my shirts?  You want to split the booze money?  Do I get a piece of the booze you're selling?  You dope.  Yeah.  We brought all those people there.  Of course.  So give us a little taste of the booze, man.  I've fought venues on that.  You get 30% of our stuff.  Why don't we get a little taste of the booze money?  I've fought venues on that. 
[00:14:30]  Because once in a while, it's common knowledge as a performer.  Like a lot of times, I'll do three-person shows where I'm closing.  I'll have two guys open or whatever.  And they want a liquor break.  They want you to take a break in between the two and then the headline act.  We took a liquor break for them.  I never would have.  I mean, they might have given us a better deal on merch.  I never do unless they give me a really good deal on the merch.  Oh, a little trade-off.  Always.  You want to split the booze money?  No?  Okay.  Well, then you know what?  You're not getting a liquor break.  You've got to let us wet our beaks.  Yes.  Like all those rape t-shirts you have in your pockets. 
[00:15:00]  Like so many nickels and dimes.  If you want to sell, how long was the liquor break?  20, 25 minutes?  How long was that break?  It was supposed to be 15, but it was closer to a half hour.  Almost a half hour.  The money they make on alcohol on that break, what makes you more money, that or a percentage  from the shirts?  I almost guarantee it's more money from the booze.  Right.  So it's like you want-  30% though.  And we like to sell our stuff as cheap as possible.  So we had to raise our price a little bit just to kind of make some shekels. 
[00:15:30]  And they only had the two tables on, small tables on complete opposite ends.  The main question I got was, where are the shirts?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of people had no clue.  I was reading the message boards and a few people said, you know, it would have made the  event better if the guys that performed and O&A would have been available to sign stuff  after the show.  We did.  Meanwhile, we were.  We were there at the table, one of the tables that was selling stuff.  Now, some people had no clue where we were. 
[00:16:00]  We signed stuff until we almost fell asleep.  Yeah, we stayed.  We stayed for a really long time.  Long time.  It was probably a couple hours after the show.  Yep.  I hate-  I have to apologize to the people at the end of the line.  They were trying to talk to us.  And at that point, my eyelids were so heavy.  I just wanted to crash so bad.  And speaking of merch, my brother's in studio because he's got to beg Ziggy for some forgiveness.  Here's another part.  Another faction that was off doing something that had an adventure. 
[00:16:30]  Well, my brother got into a couple situations that were-  A couple of situations.  That were really funny.  But if you want the merch from the show, my brother came up with a couple t-shirts for  the O&A Traveling Virus.  They're available on MyRadioStore.com.  MyRadioStore.com.  That'll pay for the van, hopefully.  Well, that's what we're getting at here.  And Jimmy's shirts, of course, EatABullet.com.  And all his merch, EatABullet.com. 
[00:17:00]  I don't want to owe anybody money, but if you want to just pay for some prostitutes for me.  Well, Ziggy from MyRadioStore.com brought the t-shirts up for the O&A Traveling Virus.  Actually, Danny drove the van, right?  Yeah, it was Danny driving it one way.  One way.  You know how the second way ended.  Danny couldn't drive.  I got video every shot Danny is in.  I was laughing because I was putting it from my camera onto my computer last night when I got home.  So I was watching the whole thing. 
[00:17:30]  And every shot Danny is in, he is drinking.  Danny is one of the many drunks who surrounds us.  We are surrounded by people who are going to die of cirrhosis.  We're drunks.  We're surrounded by alcoholics.  We really are.  Danny was so loaded.  I just wanted to say thank you for all this.  I'm getting ready to go on.  And he's literally sipping wine out of a plastic cup six inches from my face.  I just wanted to say thank you for that stuff you said on the air. 
[00:18:00]  It was the drunkest I've ever seen.  That was so cool.  Well.  So cool.  Really?  We were doing the final counts.  We're getting all this stuff settled.  And he's sticking his A into the pal talk cameras.  His hairy butt.  And I'm thinking this guy is driving us home in like five minutes.  Like no.  No he's not.  What's going on here?  Yeah.  He was a wreck.  So my brother had to drive the van back to the Crowne Plaza Hotel.  Back to the Crowne Plaza.  Which is, I swear to you, we can look at the building across the street from this studio 
[00:18:30]  that we're in right now.  It was two blocks away.  And that's how far it is.  400 feet.  400 feet away.  The van drive back to the hotel.  And my brother's, you know, you're drinking, right?  Very, very little.  Let everyone know out there.  Right.  I saw some of the message boards that booze had none a factor in it.  All right.  Just on Danny's end, of course, but not on my end.  Which, yeah.  It was either die at his hands or me drive this freaking van. 
[00:19:00]  And I felt like Captain E.J. Smith of the HMS Titanic for a 400-foot journey, which ended  very poorly.  I got to make it perfectly clear.  Ziggy, from MyRadioStore.com, buy a t-shirt.  He just got the van done with our faces.  Like the artwork on his van is unbelievable.  And it cost him thousands of dollars.  There's, you know, it's me, Anthony, and Jimmy, our faces on the side of the van. 
[00:19:30]  It says XM Satellite Radio.  It says all sorts of other things.  It's just, it's beautiful.  It really is.  He put a lot of work into his van.  So my brother's driving home from the DCU Center with the rest of the shirts and a drunk  Danny in the passenger seat, which is key to the story.  Did you mention that with the customization of this van, not only are our images all over  it and the logos and everything, but it's one of these extended top fiberglass on top  of the vans.  Jeez, that information could have come in handy a couple days ago. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, it's one of these things that gives you extended headroom inside the van.  Right.  So, you know, people make campers out of them sometimes.  It gives you a little headroom almost.  It's got a headroom for some merchandise or whatever the hell else you need.  Or you can walk around the back of the van a little bit without fucking down too low.  Yeah, a little bit without hunching over.  And it's just got our very professional wrap, they call it, around the van with our pictures  and logo and everything.  Very nice.  It's a nice van.  Nice, nice van. 
[00:20:30]  It was a nice van.  Well, you try to go into the parking garage.  All right, so, well, I drive a Jeep, a Laredo.  So, when I got in this van, it's the same exact thing.  I'm like, all right, fine.  Done this.  So, I drive the 400 feet, which takes, what, 17 seconds?  Yeah.  I start pulling into the garage or right close to it, and Danny starts yelling,  6-8, 6-8, 6-8.  I'm like, what the...  6-8.  What the hell?  Then...  Again, like the Titanic hitting a freaking iceberg. 
[00:21:00]  Danny, what the hell is 6-8?  What does that mean?  How many drinks he had?  Yeah, why would you start yelling, 6-8, 6-8?  I understand.  Yeah, in hindsight...  Yeah.  ...apparently, it's the clearance, and I'm supposed to know that this van is, in fact,  taller than 6-8.  Than 6-8.  Why doesn't he say, like, a...  Stop.  ...dead ahead or something?  How about just...  Stop!  Stop!  Yeah, the word would be stop.  Stop! 
[00:21:30]  Stop!  Because he obviously, in his own life, doesn't understand what that word means.  Yeah, Danny made quite an impression on everybody, I gotta tell ya.  Danny, what if you all stopped?  But the word has as much meaning to him as something else does to you or I in French.  So, to make a long story short...  How tall was the van?  About 7, I would say.  6'9, 6'10?  The whole top, man.  The whole top.  So you're looking probably about at least 6 inches higher than... 
[00:22:00]  It's gotta be.  Gotta be.  6'8, so it was like...  I found this thing made.  So you went under the...  You went down into the garage and you heard the awful screech.  How far...  Did you get the whole van in before you stopped it or did you like...  It was halfway through or more.  Halfway.  So now it has to back...  So what can I do?  We can't continue going forward.  No.  So I can find a way out of this pickle.  So we back up.  I'll tell you what...  With a certain happy person with us.  Oh, boy.  I know what you could have done. 
[00:22:30]  Look at the shredded fiberglass.  I can't see it.  Oh, this is up on foundrymusic.com, the picture?  It's kind of hard, the version of the picture we got.  But, yeah, there's the damage to Ziggy's van.  This is a beautiful...  Was is gonna be, again, based on my wallet, unfortunately.  It was a beautiful van.  Why do you have to pay for it?  Because I effed up, which I told...  We talked to Ziggy that night.  I mean, what can you do?  I took the keys.  I said, sure, I'll drive the 400 feet. 
[00:23:00]  Wait a minute.  Here's the thing, too.  When you backed out, you should have...  This is the genius of Boy Scouts, because it was a truck that stuck in a tunnel one time  and they couldn't get it out.  Oh, you shouldn't...  It was late to tires.  Yeah.  Oh, did you do that?  No, but it was already...  That's so crunch.  It wasn't...  Yeah, at that point, it doesn't matter.  How much is it gonna cost?  Who knows?  Probably all my brother's profits.  There were no profits.  Oh, boy.  Man, that 24 hours of Worcester was a rough time for the kid, man.  It took a big loss.  We'll get into the whole bar story and the... 
[00:23:30]  Got kicked out, got ripped off.  Yeah, we'll get into the bar story in just a bit.  We gotta take our first break, but we're just getting started.  You can see the damage to the van.  Ziggy's van.  MyRadioStore.com if you want to buy a concert t-shirt or some Opie and Anthony t-shirts.  No, go for the higher ticket items.  Ziggy has a whole wide range of stuff.  MyRadioStore.com.  MyRadioStore.com.  By the way, Ziggy, he's a good boy and he's been great to this show.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We gotta take our first break.  We'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:24:00]  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:24:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're back from our road trip back in New York City.  We did the first ONA traveling virus, the comedy event of 2006 up there in Worcester over the weekend.  Next stop, PNC Art Center.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is up on Opie and Anthony.com. 
[00:25:00]  All the comedians killed for us.  Oh, yeah.  We don't even know where to begin.  We have so many stories to tell.  Want to hit the phones really fast here.  Let's say hi to Jason in New Jersey.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How we doing?  All right, Jason.  It's good to see you guys are on live, considering the fact that you guys had a real big weekend.  We're kind of tired, to be honest with you.  We all got home late yesterday afternoon.  Wow.  Well, that's definitely surprising to see all that traffic on Long Island for Anthony.  Anyway, I wanted to thank you, Opie, because I was actually the last one online, and everybody 
[00:25:30]  was signing stuff.  Rich Voss is an idiot, but everybody was signing stuff, and you were just overly friendly with  me, shaking my hand, saying thank you for coming.  It was really cool.  It was really nice.  Real quick, I got a dumb picture with Jim Norton, and Rich Voss had decided to take a crotch  shot with me and Jimmy, but it was my last picture, so it kind of really disappointed  me, but no big deal, though.  Oh, that was your picture?  Yeah, that was my picture.  Rich Voss was trying to fool around with me, and he didn't realize I had one picture left, 
[00:26:00]  and he took a crotch shot with me and Jimmy, which is great.  You know, I could show my girlfriend.  She loves it.  That's going to suck.  I mean, yeah, dumb Voss.  We take a lot of pictures, so from time to time, we'll really try to screw up people's  pictures, just to keep it fun for us.  Yeah.  But then you get a story like this.  It was the guy's last picture on his camera.  He wanted a special shot, and he's looking at his pictures, and he sees a crotch shot.  You don't hand it to another comedian.  They're going to try to be funny.  If you want to make sure you get a really good shot of us or some of our comedy friends, 
[00:26:30]  whatever, make sure you have a friend there that you can trust.  That knows how to work the camera.  Because I hear Danny wrecked all the photos.  We're, like, posing and trying to be nice, and Danny's behind us just making drunken faces.  Just making Danny faces.  He didn't mean to make drunken faces.  He was just trying to peer in, like, what's going on?  Stupid.  Hey, real quick, got a quick question for you.  How come all the stuff you were signing was dumbrichvoss.com stuff?  I don't know.  It's funny. 
[00:27:00]  Like, you know, we had T-shirts.  Jimmy had merchandise.  Did Bill Burr have merchandise?  Billy had, I think, a CD or something.  And Voss is signing a dumb bumper sticker.  That's all he was...  No, he had his DVD.  Oh, I didn't sign one of those.  But he had, like, a load of these bumper stickers.  Yeah, we signed those.  I know the struggle stickers.  Yeah.  What?  He thought that was going to take off, like, the wow stickers.  Yeah, he thought that was the, uh, the, uh, I don't get no respect of the O's of the millennium.  What's that? 
[00:27:30]  He wants it to be as big as get her done.  Yeah, you think it's going to be get her done.  Yeah.  No one says, I know this.  Hey, I know the struggle.  Me too.  That's Voss' thing, right?  Rich Voss.  No one says it.  A few of our fans, uh, I was signing that thing, and he goes, what does that even mean?  I'm like, I don't know.  No, it's something to sign.  All right, let's go to James.  It's something nervous Voss used to say in front of black audiences.  He's like, you know, he'd kill in front of black crowds.  He'd go, I know the struggle, like, what it's like to be black.  Yeah.  And they would all laugh.  Yeah.  All right, James, what's up?  To a sticker.  Hey, guys. 
[00:28:00]  Hey.  Just wanted to thank you for a great time.  I was down there in Worcester.  Patrice and Bill set the bar unbelievably high.  I thought there had to be a letdown, but there wasn't.  Jimmy, once again, proved to be the funniest man alive.  Love you, kid.  Everybody had really, really good sets up there in Worcester, man.  Yeah, absolutely Jimmy killed.  I loved my set, but I'm very self-critical.  I was like, I wish a couple of things had gone better.  I don't like what I opened with, but aside from that, it was great. 
[00:28:30]  All right.  Oh, fantastic.  Let's go to Sonny Ferelli, one of the pests.  Pardon yourself.  That's right.  From the Boston area.  Sonny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  I tell you, you guys did a fantastic time job, man.  I tell you, I had myself one of the greatest times there, man.  Thank you.  I've lost my voice too, man.  I don't know why, but I mean, I wasn't even part of the show really, but geez, you don't  think it had something to do with the bar incident before the show started, do you?  Let me tell you how powerful the pests are, and you never know when they're going to just 
[00:29:00]  use their power.  I guess a lot of people were drinking before the show in one of the local gin mills up  there in Worcester, and my brother was at the bar.  Another story with my brother, hence the reason he's here today.  Worst 24 hours ever, but Sonny made it a little better by getting about 100 pests to leave  en masse out the door after the, how do I put this on Free FM, the cunt dripping... 
[00:29:30]  Oh, wow.  I don't think that'll make it through.  Mortender stole my money.  She was stealing other people's money.  Hold on.  I got to help you out, because you think it's cute to use that word, but then no one's  understanding what you're saying.  You won't.  Ass.  He's cute.  So everyone's drinking in this bar.  Before the show, my brother's at the bar, and what, a bartender was ripping you off or  something?  We were there for a while.  I had to go do the merch and all that, so just kind of sipping some beers there. 
[00:30:00]  And I was buying some drinks for pass.  We ate some food.  So I kept putting 20s down.  And I turned around.  Kara from MySpace was there with Eddie and JJ was there.  So a bunch of the pests.  And we're looking at the Miss Virus contestants on screen.  Oh, we'll get into that in a minute.  We're talking five feet behind me.  So I look at it.  I'm like, all right, cool.  I turn around, and my pile of money is like 40, 50 bucks easily.  Gone.  She just took it off the bar. 
[00:30:30]  Who was she?  The bartender?  The bartender.  Oh, boy.  That's a bartending trick, by the way.  When you leave money on the bar, like, you know, you throw your lot down.  Yeah, maybe a five or something like that.  And if you slip away for a while, you take the five.  You don't grab 50 bucks off the bar.  Well, it was a sleazy bitch.  It was a madhouse.  It was a zoo because everyone went to this one bar, especially the O&A Pest.  They all got together.  You know, they kind of travel in groups now.  And my brother's there enjoying himself and notices that all his money from the bar is gone. 
[00:31:00]  I'm five feet away.  I mean, a happy typing girl was hanging with me most of the time in his other past.  She's still there.  And this woman, this chick, this bitter.  Jimmy, if you could take what's in my head and express it as only you can do it.  This silly goose of a gal.  Oh, that's perfect.  I don't mean to get too salty this early.  Easy.  She takes the money, so all I do is I go back.  How about this typical woman?  Oh, there you go.  You know what it is?  It's one of these miserable bartenders that are working at this miserable bar. 
[00:31:30]  And her life is just miserable.  Probably the locals that go in there don't tip her crap.  The sad part, this was going to be a big afternoon for her.  Yeah, this would have been big.  You guys would have tipped her big.  I mean, how much action does a bar like this in Worcester get on a Saturday afternoon?  Please, the local yokels go in, down a few beers, and might leave loose change on the bar.  What's the name of the bar, do you want to say? 
[00:32:00]  Fair enough.  The Irish Times?  The Irish Times.  It got attacked, so that was good.  Did it?  All I did was I asked her.  I said, hey, carry my money back.  She starts cursing at me.  She draws this invisible line on the bar.  If it's here, it's mine.  Are you kidding me?  Dude, she started making a scene.  And as Opie and I know, we grew up in a freaking crazy household.  You think making a scene with me is going to deter me?  No, not at all.  You're screaming like a maniac?  If it's here, it's mine? 
[00:32:30]  Exactly.  How about like, it's my money, you dope?  Well, that was kind of my reply.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it got ugly very quickly.  She's screaming and yelling.  How do you fight with a girl?  What am I going to do?  Go over to the bar and swing at her?  She could scream and yell and do whatever she wants.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, she has bouncers coming, so I go to the front end.  Oh, you're instantly wrong now.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's screaming, get the F out, get the F out.  And also, the funniest thing, this guy shrieks somewhere.  Oh, my God.  They kicked Brother Elmo out. 
[00:33:00]  And it was kind of like something you would hear.  Wait, did they drag you out?  No.  I went right to these two guys.  Anybody there can attest.  I was right at them.  Like, you know, hey, take a fucking.  Sorry.  Here we go again.  Sorry.  Take a swing at me.  And Sonny Ferrelli started gathering everybody, just making an announcement.  And next thing you know, everybody just starts chanting and just yelling.  And we all leave.  This is the power of the One Pest, what he's getting at.  98% of the bar emptied out after my brother got kicked out. 
[00:33:30]  Sonny Ferrelli, you made, like, some huge announcement, like, we're out of here?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  And this is a funny thing.  The bartender was going to have a killer day.  So for the stupid 40 bucks or whatever she got off my brother, that was it for the day  because the whole place just left the bar.  Yeah, probably would have made a couple of hundred.  You know what I made it even worse?  I gave her a $10 tip for a $14 drink tab right before this whole crap happened.  You know?  So the Irish pub, maybe somebody knows the owner there and can call them and just let 
[00:34:00]  them know.  That your bartender's a thief.  The fact that, allegedly, your bartender, it looks like she took money from Elmo that  she shouldn't have.  And that cost his establishment thousands of dollars.  Easily.  Thousands of dollars.  Now, there's about 100 pests outside now after we're all gathered up.  Wait, I want to let that settle in, how beautiful this was.  Sonny Ferrelli makes the announcement and no one even questioned it.  They're like, all right, we're out of here.  And they all just left their beers half full. 
[00:34:30]  Well, they probably chugged them down.  Yeah, who am I kidding?  Who am I kidding?  You're right.  And whatever was left over, I'm sure Danny was running around and drinking as fast as  he could.  He emptied everyone, like a six-year-old at someone's adult party.  He sneaks out of his room.  Wrung out the bar rag in his mouth.  The beauty of Danny, too, because I saw that he was hammered backstage.  I'm like, wow, you seem really drunk.  He's, like, blaming his drinking on the fact that he stopped smoking.  Yeah, we're buying it, Danny. 
[00:35:00]  We're buying that one.  Yeah, no filter parlor even left his credit card there.  He left so fast.  Yeah, so they all just filed out.  Anyway, you're outside the establishment.  Go ahead, Sonny.  So anyways, there's about 100 of us outside the establishment, right?  All of a sudden, I start chanting, you effed up!  You effed up!  You effed up!  You effed up!  And the guy comes out.  You know, the provider, the establishment comes out and says, oh, sir, I dare you to say  that again while I'm out here.  So I turn around and says, all right, you effed up! 
[00:35:30]  You effed up!  And what did he do?  He's just, like, sitting there like a stupid dolt.  So the Irish pub, is that what they're called?  The Irish Times.  There you go.  Bunch of dopes.  Well, they already lost a lot of business.  They could have had a really nice Saturday afternoon.  Hit them in their pocket books.  There you go.  Sonny.  Got them by their purse strings now.  What was your favorite part of the O&A traveling virus?  I'll tell you, everything was so great.  You know, I'll tell you what.  My endorphins were kicking in all night.  You know, by the time the last Tracy Morgan came on, my endorphins were crashing. 
[00:36:00]  But the whole show was just fantastic, man.  It was just great.  Yeah, right on.  We were very, very happy with how it turned out.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Sonny.  Thank you, Angel.  All right.  Congratulations, boys.  And have Kenny give me a call as soon as possible, will you?  As soon as possible.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  What's up, Dan?  The show was, if I may steal a word, phenomenal.  Okay.  And then after the show, I got my autograph signed by Opie and got a quick little not-you line 
[00:36:30]  in.  And then I get up to Anthony, and I figured that if I was going to blow in front of my  radio hero for the past four years or so, it was going to be me messing up.  Except Anthony's girlfriend decides to take that moment to point out that I have fuzz on  my collared shirt.  Yes.  The one picture that I get is me, blurred, picking a fuzz off my shirt, embarrassed in  front of my idol.  He's picking fuzz off his shirt, and he's all blurry.  Why do you idolize Anthony's girlfriend? 
[00:37:00]  And why do you care about a fuzz on your shirt, you're a creep?  Click.  What does he call a creep in a clear?  He might call him a career.  Dan, what was your favorite part of the show?  My favorite part was when I walked over and asked Pat from Menaki to wipe my shirt on  his forehead, and Danny decided to one-up him by sticking it down the front of his pants  and caressing his junk.  Of course Danny did.  Where's Danny?  He's hiding today.  Where is Danny, man?  He always thinks it's a good idea, and then the next day he hides.  Let's go to Dan in Massachusetts. 
[00:37:30]  Denial.  Dan?  Hey, boys.  It's Phillip Eaton Cox.  That's with a hyphen.  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to thank you guys for the...  That joke was awful, and they dumped out.  What's up, Dan?  You guys are awesome, man.  I've been listening to this since 1995.  I've been hooked to the virus all these years.  Jimmy Norton, you are by far the funniest stand-up comic I've ever seen.  Thank you, mister.  And you are the best part of the Opie and Anthony show, the new part of the Opie and 
[00:38:00]  Anthony show, man.  Oh.  Oh.  Challenging words.  Challenging observation, Randall.  Yeah, a lot of people don't know the Opie and Anthony show back on WAF was a lot  different than any other show they've done in the past.  I want audio of that show.  I want audio.  I've heard three of Anthony's lines, and I'm obsessed with hearing them.  Oh, no.  That was BAB.  Yeah.  I got good at that, my friend.  Yeah, we did some good stuff on AF.  It was the BAB tapes you want. 
[00:38:30]  Because we were talking about that on the way home.  Oh, yeah.  I hear Anthony's older stuff.  Oh, it's horrific.  You were so happy.  Yeah, we'll get to it.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Really?  I know.  Just happy to be there.  Blubbering idiot.  Thank you, buddy.  Jimmy, I've got over 72 hours of the WAF stuff on tape, so if you want it, I'll send it to  you.  Thank you.  If you have any friends with Spock Buckley, please, have it immediately shipped here.  I wasn't listening at that time.  All right, Dan, what else do you want to say? 
[00:39:00]  We've got to move on.  We've got a lot of people trying to check in today.  Yeah, you guys are...  I just wanted to say, Jimmy was the best comic of the night.  I just wanted to thank them.  You guys are hilarious.  Your little video thing you did was absolutely hilarious.  Thank you for the good time, man.  All right.  This would be a good time to mention the video we decided to make backstage.  I got a copy of it, but it's clipping, so Steve's back at XM trying to fix it so we  could get it online immediately.  Clipping.  But I came up with this idea, and I didn't really have an ending to it, and then Jimmy came 
[00:39:30]  up with just an amazing ending for my little video.  Oh, he certainly did.  My little video comedy piece, because they didn't want us to appear until, like, halfway  through the show.  They wanted the show to build, and then eventually Ed and I made our appearance, and our bits  sucked, and we'll get into the reason why it sucked in a little while here.  It's more of a segment.  Our segment.  Yeah, well, we had a bunch of things we were doing during the show, but we were bored, 
[00:40:00]  so we're like, why don't we at least, like, you know, film a video piece, and we'll play  that.  A vignette.  Yeah, there you go.  A vignette.  And they could go, you know, a la WWE type thing where they take us back and show what's  going on in the dressing room.  Right.  That's what they did.  So we had a couple concepts, and we don't want to blow the other concepts, because we  might still film them.  Oh, we will.  We might film them, though.  There's a couple that are really, really funny, if we could pull them off.  So we go with this one concept that, you know, Voss goes on stage. 
[00:40:30]  This was one of the only production F-ups, by the way, in the whole show.  Voss was supposed to go on stage in between some of the comics and, you know, say that  there's something wrong, you know, backstage.  Something is going on.  There's a commotion.  Like Anthony said, like WWE style, right?  Yeah.  So Voss is like, he's supposed to go, let's go backstage and see what's going on.  And at that point, you see Anthony on a cell phone.  But it wasn't queued up right.  It didn't work. 
[00:41:00]  And then it was just audio and no video.  It's a little glitch.  A little glitch.  It was worth it just to see Voss's acting.  What?  What?  We got a problem?  What?  What?  And he actually pokes his head back and looks like he's a method actor?  Yeah.  Why?  How do I have?  What problem?  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Backstage, I'm trying to get him psyched up and tell him, this is all you need to do.  And he was in panic mode because he had to improvise.  I'm like, it's so easy.  Make believe like someone's talking in your ear like, what?  There's a problem? 
[00:41:30]  What?  What's going on?  I need a script.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm being on the phone with the promoter.  What?  Well, let's check it out.  What?  Right, right.  It was so awful over the top.  And all he was supposed to say was something like, yeah, there's a problem.  You know, obviously you haven't seen Opie and Anthony yet.  There seems to be a problem backstage.  Let's go backstage and see what the heck is going on.  That's all he really had to do.  Yeah.  And then the tape screwed up.  So that put him in panic mode where he's like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  But we finally get the tape on and we got two really, really over the top laughs. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And you guys didn't even really hear the dialogue because the laughing drowned out what was being said.  And incidentally, I have a quick suggestion for Steve.  If the dialogue is, if the sound is messed up, because apparently there's some kind of a ticking on our version of it, transcribe it and put subtitles on Foundry because people can read it because it's very easy to know exactly what we're saying.  And Kenny's going to make sure we get another copy because this videotape has to be seen.  Yeah.  So finally, the videotape is shown.  And if you weren't at the show, this is what you're going to see.  And we're going to do different ones for other shows, by the way. 
[00:42:30]  The shows can be a little different.  Every city we go to, by the way, the comedians get a little different.  Some of the things we do in between the comedians a little different.  So we're not really blowing anything.  This video will be up on opieandanthony.com for you to check out.  So Anthony's on the phone.  Why don't you take it from there, Anthony?  I'd just say that there's a problem with Opie.  Yeah.  There's a problem.  I don't know what it is.  He's never been like this before.  He's acting very unprofessionally.  And I can't seem to talk to him. 
[00:43:00]  And then we walk over to him.  And you were like, you know, I've had it.  Yeah.  He does this type of thing all the time.  And, you know, we have to go out there.  And you're obviously on the phone with the promoter.  Yeah, with somebody of importance.  Sure.  And go over to the...  Your acting was wonderful, by the way.  Thank you.  It really was.  Academy Award winner.  I really believed you were actually talking to somebody.  I am.  How do you have to get a promoter on the phone to play this off so quickly?  I am very good.  I imagine that they're on the other side.  In Hollywood, they usually have someone on the other side. 
[00:43:30]  So you can play along nice.  You don't even need it.  You don't even need it.  You don't need it.  I took a little pause where the guy was talking.  And I was listening.  I did a great job.  It was as good of fake phone conversations I've ever seen.  Like, if you didn't know, you'd think he was...  He talks on the phone.  You'd think it was the real person he was talking to.  Well, believe me.  I was just the straight man set up thing for this.  You're sitting on the couch.  You're doing wine.  You're talking to the promoter.  There's a problem.  He does this.  And it's just...  It's annoying.  Legs crossed.  Apparently, you're on the phone like Truman Capote when you're on the phone. 
[00:44:00]  Maybe he's sick.  Why won't he come out?  So then you're like, all right, I'll go see what's going on.  So you get up and the cameraman follows you.  Yeah.  Over to a big shower.  Right.  But there's a curtain in front of the shower.  Yeah.  A shower curtain.  You open up the huge curtain that leads you into this huge shower room.  Yes.  And?  And there we reveal Opie sort of curled up in the fetal position but standing on his feet  but curled up, grabbing your ankles, squatting.  It's kind of like, you know, the girl in the shower after she's been raped. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  Looking like that.  And you look at the camera kind of and then look away and look at it again shouting,  go away, go away.  No.  Go away.  Leave me alone.  No.  Putting his hand up defensively.  Shaking.  Shaking.  In his underpants.  And you're in your underpants, by the way.  And that's how the bit was going to end and I'm thinking, we need an ending.  It got that right there.  Got a huge laugh. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Got a huge laugh from the crowd watching it on the big screen.  But we're like, we really need an ending.  So then Jimmy came to the rescue.  So there's the shot.  And then from.  And then it was just going to go black and big laugh.  Next comedian.  But anyway, go ahead.  From off camera, walking into frame towards Opie is a completely, and I mean completely,  not a stitch of clothing, completely nude Jim Norton walking towards Opie. 
[00:45:30]  He stops.  My hands are on my hips.  I'm timbo.  Your hands on your hips, completely naked.  From the back, we see Jimmy.  You turn around a little bit and you're yelling something at Opie.  I forget.  I said something about stop your crying.  Stop your crying.  Take it like a man kind of a thing.  And then he turns, looks into the camera and says, no homo. 
[00:46:00]  And starts walking towards Opie as it goes, fades to black.  But it was such a, it got a really nice laugh and you couldn't hear the horn.  A nice laugh.  This is what I'm trying to say.  I got a pretty good laugh.  I got a really good laugh.  I was, I was pretty psyched.  And then when Jimmy appeared, any laugh I got, forget about it.  It was screams.  It was thrown away.  They screamed.  They started screaming, laughing at the same time.  And then the screen goes black.  And then there's Voss trying to improv his way to the next scene.  Oh, boy.  I guess they, I guess they, I hope they work that out. 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  Wow.  What's going to happen?  Wow.  Wow.  I, uh.  Does a spit take.  Right.  I know.  Gleason was better when Mr. Marshall walked into the office.  The boss was trying to act like it was a problem.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  We're trying to get the audio just so you could hear the audio portion of it.  And by the way, we had to do two takes.  Yeah, that's what I wanted to get into.  I was really hurt because I, I, I walked in and I got to be honest and I'm, I'm kind  of glad this happened, but I was nude and I wasn't going to show frontal nudity, 
[00:47:00]  obviously.  No.  Why get the whole crowd all lathered up?  Right.  Just from the back.  And then as you started turning toward the camera, the cameraman kind of comes up on  you a little bit.  Yeah.  So he cuts out all the nasty bits.  But you got to remember, I'm like, I'm, I'm on, you know, my knees and my elbows in  the corner and I have to look up towards Jimmy.  Yeah.  And you, because you know, this is supposed to be from your eyes, the videotape, right?  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  What?  I don't know.  It looked like cartoon us on channel five.  It's funny.  All right.  So, uh, we got distracted.  We get distracted very easy on the show.  Pretty colors.  So it was my time to, to turn toward Jimmy.  Yeah.  And as I turned toward Jimmy, because I'm so low and you're sitting, now you're seeing  the part the camera isn't seeing.  You're seeing frontal nudity of Jimmy.  I look up and I look at Jimmy completely nude and not a, well, let's make the air.  Not a hair on him.  Yeah.  All right.  Nothing going on. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Well.  In more ways than one.  Said that a few times.  Thank God.  Thank God, by the way.  Not, not a hint of a hair.  Yeah.  He looked like a, an overgrown baby.  I started laughing so hard.  And then I hear the cameraman and the director, cause they're panicking.  They want to get this on the show within minutes.  Yeah.  I started laughing my ass off.  The scene I saw was hilarious.  And, and all I hear is, ah, you laughed.  You wrecked the whole take.  You're getting all mad. 
[00:48:30]  I'm like, you, you have to see what I just saw.  Let me tell you something.  It was almost like ice water had been splashed on my back.  I looked like a fleshy colored inner tube.  You know, a little piece that sticks out for the air.  Right.  To be blown into.  Little thing you put the air in.  I was envious of that.  I have never been packing so little in my life.  And I obviously was grateful.  Had I known in advance, though, that that was going to happen, believe me, I would have  taken a pill just to make you uncomfortable.  Don't worry. 
[00:49:00]  I was already uncomfortable.  Yeah.  That was pretty uncomfortable.  That was my first nude scene.  Trust me.  Mine too.  And my, and my last.  Well, you were, you're under.  Hey, that's his new.  That's my nude scene right there.  That doesn't get any better than that.  Yeah.  The only nudity you'll ever have.  So.  My cheeks look pretty good, though.  I got to say.  We're trying to get the audio on before we take a break here.  Hey, the video is up on opianthony.com.  The video has made its way to opianthony.com.  Can someone make sure this video gets to YouTube as well, please?  And make sure that there's no full frontal for me, even a glimpse. 
[00:49:30]  Neither would it be without the Hubble.  Believe me.  I don't know.  I checked.  I thought when you turned around at one point before the camera came up, I was checking on  that.  And no, I think you're safe.  I think so, too.  Yeah.  I don't want people just thinking that's me.  Believe me.  If it was a little warmer in there and I was a little more comfortable, I would have  turned around and waved to the crowd.  Maybe if somebody else was in the corner.  Like you.  Well.  I'm not a blonde guy.  I go for brown-haired men.  Like the brunettes. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, it was awful.  All right.  They're cleaning up the audio because there's a few beeps.  But the video is up on opianthony.com.  And we need it to be added to YouTube.  I think this video is going to be seen by a lot of people.  Oh, yeah.  So it was one of the vignettes we did.  It was a lot of fun.  All right.  In the comics, I didn't see a lot of the sets.  I heard Patrice destroyed.  Yep.  Bob Kelly destroyed.  No, Bob always kills that big-  Everyone, though.  I mean, that's because I was asking Jimmy on the way home because, I mean, we were too  busy trying to get things going backstage.  So I tried to watch about five minutes of every guy. 
[00:50:30]  And what I saw was everyone was killing.  And I asked Jimmy on the way home, besides you, because I didn't want to put him in a  bad spot.  I'm like, who else killed?  And we honestly couldn't really- Everyone killed is what the answer is, I guess, what  I'm trying to say here.  Yeah.  And, yeah, it was- I saw part of Saget's set.  He was just murdering.  Oh, he completely had the crowd.  Yeah.  And, I mean, if one of my friends bombed, believe me, we're not being dishonest, there's  nothing I would like more than to throw one of these dopes under the bus and tell you 
[00:51:00]  how they died.  Boss killed as a host.  I mean, he always went, I'll host it.  But he is just the best host.  I mean, he just kills through the entire show.  It was great, man.  Right.  Tracy Morgan had a tough spot, too, going on last.  Yep.  And, you know, all the topics had been covered and stepped on and squashed, and he still  pulled it out and did a great job.  Well, Tracy supposedly got kicked out of the hotel.  We'll get into that story.  Why?  Into that story.  We got to get into the Twitchell story.  And there's Opie in the corner, and Jimmy-  You really- Your face, you really look pained, man. 
[00:51:30]  I told you.  I'm an ax shot.  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord.  Way to put the Foundry music logo over my cheeks, stupid.  Does the Foundry logo have to be over the punchline of the joke?  Take the Foundry music logo off if you could.  Oh, my God.  Could you put it in a corner somewhere like a-  Please.  Like a TV station does?  Why is the Foundry music logo-  Steve, you had nothing to do with this video.  Give us a break every once in a while.  It's completely over the punchline, which is Jimmy's butt.  Steve didn't film this. 
[00:52:00]  Steve wasn't even there.  He had a flat tire.  In fairness, I will say-  What, someone stepped on his shoe?  I will say this.  I will say, in fairness, it's probably just a standard thing they do with-  Why are you freaking-  You had nothing to do with this video.  Look at that.  The Foundry music-  Look at where the logo is.  You told me to put the traveling virus thing on there.  Yes, that is fine.  And maybe for once, write opianthony.com instead of Foundry music.  It had nothing to do with this.  Just put it on the side.  But look, it's covering up the joke, which is the fact that Jimmy-  I challenge you to have a laugh while everyone else is filling up looking at that. 
[00:52:30]  I didn't mean that.  I meant the punchline of the-  Jimmy, now that the video's paused-  Didn't yet.  What the F is going on at the top of your crack?  Let me see.  Where?  The top of the crack.  There seems to be a, you know, maybe you should have, you know-  Oh, that area.  No, no, no, never.  Please.  No?  I'm immaculate.  I shower.  All right.  Please.  All right, well-  Picture eating a fresh cantaloupe.  Oh. 
[00:53:00]  Cool and refreshing.  And delicious, if I may.  Well, the video's up.  Can we get it on YouTube as well?  While Eric eats cantaloupe out of his stupid fruit dish.  There's the foundrymusic.com website there.  Yeah, just, and whoever put together those foundry videos, I was not even in them at all.  Could I have been in them a little bit more?  I mean, I-  A little bit?  I know, right?  A little bit?  Well, we're gonna-  What the hell?  We're gonna definitely tweak.  Heck.  But you're right.  One of the things we're gonna have to tweak for the next one at the PNC Arts Center. 
[00:53:30]  Here's the audio of the bit, but the bit is now up on opianathlete.com.  You gotta see the video.  And that's just, like, they put in the website, this is a standard thing they do.  It all, you know, it just goes up there in the window, probably, so.  That annoys me, though, that the logo, it reminds me of television, especially now.  They put the logo of the station in the corner, and now they run promos that, like, are movies  on the bottom of the screen.  You're trying to watch a movie, and a car comes, or, brrm, brrm, brrm, there's sound  effects to it now.  All right, stop with the commercials for your shows. 
[00:54:00]  Trying to watch this.  Yeah, sometimes you gotta, and I've seen other websites, porn websites that do it.  It's just, it just probably, it's almost like a template, I guess.  You know, this is where it goes on the screen, and the template's shown.  And you have to make a concept of, oh my god, let's move the logo to the side.  Yeah.  So it's not.  Oh, annoying.  I'm not trying to brag.  Yes.  But when you see my, my, my ass, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's lovely.  It's lovely.  I talk to my call, I'm like, how fast would I be attacked in jail?  And I, and I knew, that's why I behaved.  That ass is the reason I pay my taxes. 
[00:54:30]  Oh my god.  That's why I pay taxes.  All right, listen, here's the audio.  Clips a little bit at the end, because we got a bad copy, but the video that you're now  looking at on opianthony.com is fine.  How's my acting?  Here's the audio.  People saying I was a little over the top with my acting.  It's good, you're supposed to be, you're cowering about to be raped.  Silly goose.  He won't come out.  It's completely unprofessional.  I've never seen him like this before.  That's not a great acting.  Three f***ing times I've tried.  One more, and this is it, because I can't f***ing go out there by myself. 
[00:55:00]  There's a problem.  I don't know.  Never seen him in a state like this.  Opie, we got a show to do.  We got to.  Go away!  I said go away, please!  Just go away!  Go away!  Something.  Go away!  I don't know what the f*** it is.  Go away!  Stop your crying.  No, homo. 
[00:55:30]  All right, well, you know what?  There was a curse in there.  Good job.  Who got the job of believing that?  We need, of course, to blame somebody.  It's what we do on this show.  It's a blame game.  Who did it?  Forget it.  Sam, did you?  Sam.  No, I'm not going to forget it.  I'm not going to forget it.  I'm not.  The only way these people learn is by discipline.  This has to be run like a pirate ship.  That's right.  I wasn't cursing.  I said pirate ship.  Here's your, get in here and get your mouth kissed.  Where is that girl?  Well, we got to take a break.  That's why I said we're gay. 
[00:56:00]  Can we beat him up after the break?  How do you miss it?  Sam, you missed an F.  It's an F word.  How do you miss an F word?  Which messed up the audio playback there.  You didn't listen to it.  The whole word in there?  The whole word.  No, just the F.  That's why we don't like the letter F.  The whole word comes through loud and clear.  Stop trying to grow a mustache.  It doesn't matter where it is.  Just take your beating.  You did not listen to the entire thing enough where you missed an F word. 
[00:56:30]  Yep.  Didn't realize.  I'm sorry.  Of course.  Shame on you.  Oh, that had a hurt.  Hey, there you go.  Kenny slapped Sam's hand and we can't tell.  It's almost like a purple now, not red.  Can you stop tucking in your creepy shirts?  Thank you.  All right.  We beat up Kenny pretty bad on the way home.  It was a lot of fun, actually.  What a maniac.  And I got it, by the way.  Nobody wants to hug Ob's brother, especially Ziggy, but more than I do.  Why?  Because Club Soda Kenny is normally extremely. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, we're so late.  Let's talk about when we get back.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Here's a big teaser.  Because that's another 10 minutes, I'm telling you.  Oh, here's a teaser.  And we got Star here.  Did you hear yet?  You got to tell Star.  You got to wait like 15 minutes because we got a couple more stories to get to and then  we'll get into what Star is all about.  Oh, I love him.  He got fired here in New York City.  Actually, he was syndicated to a bunch of places.  Yeah.  It's a very, very big radio story.  Actually, it's on page three of the post today.  In the post, they were showing it on Fox 5 News.  Yeah, we'll get into it in a little bit with Star.  But we still got to talk about Stalker Patty. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, I know.  Look, they're panicking with the break signs now.  All right.  Just break.  No, I want to tease a couple things.  We got Jimmy's Ozzy thing.  We got Kenny versus Twitchell's.  Twitchell's running away crying.  Crying to Ant.  And now we think he's insane.  Patty wowed by the hotel room coffee maker.  We also saw her in the dining hall at the hotel with a gentleman.  We want to know what that's about.  E-Rock dressed like a Boy Scout on his way to play kickball. 
[00:58:00]  Our horrible bit we had to do, the wow-less Miss Virus competition.  We'll get into that train wreck.  Andrew Dice gay killing.  We got lots of stories to come as far as the O&A traveling virus goes.  Speaking of which, do you want to go see the O&A traveling virus at PNC Bank Art Center on August 26th?  That's the next stop on this thing.  All info on opiananthony.com, by the way.  Text the word virus now to 69923.  Text the word virus now to 69923.

All right, we'll talk to Star in a little bit here.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show.  No!  Oh, God!  He spilled my chip.

It's on YouTube.  Check it out for yourself.  We'll have more stories from the O&A Traveling Virus  in just a bit, but we should get into the star thing, right?  Yeah, it's a very big story here in New York. 
[01:00:00]  I made the whole country up.  Yeah, it did.  Definitely.  At least as much as, you know, we did at some point.  Yeah, the star ran into some trouble.  Got on the air.  Said some things.  DJ here on, I think it's Power 105.  He was in some kind of a battle with another guy.  Now, who was the other guy?  I don't know.  DJ, I think it was DJ Envy at the Hot 97.  All right.  And he said some things about his wife and daughter.  Right.  And it was, like, blown out of proportion that he was, I don't know, 
[01:00:30]  trying to incite violence against the guy's kids and wife.  And it ended in an arrest and him getting fired.  There he is.  There he is.  What's up, man?  There's Star.  There's Buckwild.  How Buckwild exists?  We didn't know if you were real or not.  We didn't know you were real.  He's like, what's up?  What's up, Star?  Good morning.  What's happening?  You guys want to kiss the ring now or later? 
[01:01:00]  We ain't kissing the ring.  Look at the size of that thing.  Come on.  You've been outdone.  Come on.  You've been outdone.  We haven't been outdone.  Who are you kidding?  We haven't been outdone.  Well, we weren't arrested.  We absolutely have not been outdone.  We weren't arrested.  I'll give you that one.  Who's Buckwild?  All right.  He's been sober six days.  Round of applause.  Six days.  All right.  Why don't you sit over there?  He doesn't talk.  Go in the other room.  Go ahead.  See you later.  He's like a pet or something.  Kicks him right out.  He's just a pet.  What's going on, fellas?  He's just a pet.  I don't know.  Yeah, we didn't get arrested. 
[01:01:30]  I'll give you that.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  You've been outdone.  Come on.  Admit it.  I don't know.  I think we're on equal footing as far as the...  Absolutely not.  Hell no, we're not on equal.  No.  As far as...  Don't kiss his ass.  I'm not kissing his ass.  He did not outdo us.  I'm saying as far as...  If we want to get into this, he did not outdo us.  He got arrested.  How many arrests associated with your show?  What's that?  How many arrests associated with your show?  One arrest.  Exactly.  We've had 20.  Yeah, we got 20 people arrested.  But how about you guys?  Any arrests?  We hid.  No, no.  He's been arrested?  Never mind. 
[01:02:00]  Jimmy was arrested, yeah.  The fans and listeners.  Have you guys been arrested?  No.  I'm not a fan of arrest.  No, personally, I've never been arrested.  We're not equal.  Jimmy got arrested.  Huh?  Jimmy got arrested.  Jimmy got arrested.  He doesn't know that I'm a part of the show.  He thinks I'm like a listener who's just sitting there.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Our whole staff got...  No disrespect.  I've heard your show a few times.  The whole staff got arrested.  No, no, no.  I don't hate like that.  But I mean, I spent the night in jail for the show.  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's been in a joint.  And so did Steve and Ben, who's now not with us.  And after the Sex with Sam thing, they were looking for us, but we kind of... 
[01:02:30]  We hid.  We kind of hid until it blew over.  We hid out.  Wasn't going to turn myself in.  Screw that.  I can't handle the joint.  What's going on, fellas?  What's going on with you?  See your picture in the paper?  How about that?  And that's the Daily News, not the New York Post.  The Daily News.  Yeah.  This is why I love...  Well, the Post doesn't like writing about radio stories anymore.  He gave up.  He said things about Envy's wife that were, according to a lot of people, racially insensitive.  And I love the fact that you said this in the Daily News.  And this is like, how long did this happen? 
[01:03:00]  What's that?  The whole incident, yeah.  The beautiful quagmire back in May.  So it's only like a couple of months later, and you're very unapologetic about it, which  I love.  Here's the quote.  So what?  You're offended.  Get over it.  We're all offended by something.  I'm offended every day by people who wave the flag of Jesus, he said, referring to his  atheism.  That's right.  I'm not going to grovel to soothe the current climate of pressure groups.  He adds, I didn't just one day decide to go after someone's Asian kid.  I've made jokes about Italians, blacks, and Jews.  That's right.  That's what I do. 
[01:03:30]  Niggas, fics, godheads, and everybody.  Come on.  Let's talk about it.  Good.  Let's talk about it.  People get very offended.  They get pissed off.  I think what it was was the kid thing, though.  That's what, like, everybody jumped on you for.  Well, you know, I mean, I've never seen anybody's kid.  DJ Envy is probably a nice kid.  I haven't seen him in years.  I don't know his wife.  But, you know, they have actually helped in my career.  So God bless them.  There is no God, but God bless them.  You take it as just, you know, as a radio thing, and the guy shouldn't have taken it 
[01:04:00]  so seriously?  Well, you know, there's a difference between hood talk and mainstream talk.  And hood talk is something that people want to be in the mix with.  They want to try to understand it.  They want to peek into that world once in a while.  Who does Bill O'Reilly beef with?  The guy, Keith Oberman.  Now, could you imagine these guys, you know, getting at each other in a way that people think  is offensive? 
[01:04:30]  You know, it's what it is.  Now, the story you're referring to in the Daily News, that was actually the writer who  said unapologetic.  You know, a statement was issued, an apology, and that's it.  I mean, you know, what do you want?  You want me to give blood?  I mean, you know, when does it stop?  Right.  You know?  Yeah, well, some people would say, yeah, they want you to give blood.  They want you to never work again.  They want you to, you know, that's what happens.  Well, you know what?  This is a new day in America.  And if that's what we are, where, you know, everybody's got a gripe over something you  say, then this is a new day in America, and I'm ready to move on.  But it pretty much is, because I'll tell you something. 
[01:05:00]  You say something on the air, somebody doesn't like it, they're not going to want you to work  again.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean, you know, you have to just take a slap or a foot in the  ass and just go away and hide somewhere.  This is still America.  And, you know, our courts are not run by popular opinion.  We have a thing called due process of law.  And I'm 42 years of age.  I'm not 25 years old.  I'm not a rapper.  I'm not a goddamn former DJ.  I'm not a comedian.  So I have a right to make a living in this country.  Oh, and by the way, I own businesses. 
[01:05:30]  I'm not a, you know, unemployed as the paper, you know, referring to people saying, oh, well,  what do you want to do?  You want a new job?  I don't want a job.  I want a goddamn adventure.  All right?  It's for real, man.  It's amazing how political correctness, because John Liu, who's an Asian councilman here,  and he's pretty much, no one listens to him until there's a problem with an Asian slur.  No one acknowledges this guy until someone slurs an Asian, and all of a sudden, he's  at the forefront, and people are like, oh, I've got to listen to John Liu.  Oh, he's a cowboy.  He's a big-time cowboy.  Yeah.  Say anything bad about the Asians, John Liu's going to come after him. 
[01:06:00]  And he's the one that went after 97 for the Tsunami song, which sank Rick and my friend  Todd, all those guys, went down the drain for that.  Well, there's a line that you can cross as an aspiring politician, but what his office  is supposed to be doing has nothing to do with going after entertainers.  So that's something, you know, I don't want to speak about too much.  You know, I'll deal with him in court.  Actually, he'll deal with a process called discovery and depositions, which will dig and 
[01:06:30]  dig to see who's connected to what and how he handles or how he gets involved in certain  things.  So it's not just him out there on the front line, and that's what's important.  And people don't seem to realize this is not about me trying to get even with John Liu.  I don't know the guy.  I never met the guy.  I don't care about him.  But, you know, here in America, as I said, if there is a line that people cross, then we  all have to be held accountable.  You don't get immunity because you sit down at City Hall and you call press conferences 
[01:07:00]  and you think you're above the law.  So that process will be dealt with, as I said, by way of a deposition.  But what's the court case about?  If this whole thing is settled, it's a lawsuit.  Well, here's the thing.  If I cross the line or supposedly cross the line and everybody gets offended, if I tell  a joke about blacks, Jews or gays or something like that and an apology is issued, okay,  get over it.  Move on with your life.  This guy seems to be wanting to beat a drum about a pedophilia act. 
[01:07:30]  My charges were dropped.  My charges are not going to be dropped in six months.  They were dropped.  And to make some people feel better about themselves and the high-profile blunder, I  was given three days of community service.  Let me say I proudly picked up trash up on 98th and Amsterdam Avenue.  But, you know, making statements like I should be terminated from the face of the earth, is  that crossing the line?  I ask you. 
[01:08:00]  And he called you a pedophile.  And he said you're a pedophile.  And again, in the Daily News, I'm not a pedophile.  So he's going to have to slow it down, Starr said.  I said he's a cowboy.  You said he's too much of a cowboy right now.  He's trying to interfere with my business.  Because you fired a defamation lawsuit against him for calling you a pedophile.  Because I remember that quote.  He didn't say it to be funny.  He didn't say it in the context of humor, John Lue.  So he's not an entertainer who said something and said, hey, you know what, if I cross the  line, you know, I apologize and let's get past this. 
[01:08:30]  He seems to be trying to promote his own agenda.  So, you know, this is a case that was researched very well.  I didn't just wake up one day and say, oh, let's go after this guy.  No.  This was researched very well.  And I hope people take this very serious.  People like yourselves who host radio shows, journalists, writers, news anchors, this is  a different day in America, a totally different day.  And so we'll see how that process goes along. 
[01:09:00]  But let me just say again, not to harp on it too much, there are many people who need to  take notice of what's going to happen with this whole process with this guy, John Lue.  What do you think about you're a former employer?  Clay Channel.  Yeah.  Beautiful people.  I just deposited a check last week.  Let me upload this.  All right.  What do you think, though, about getting fired for not breaking FCC rules?  I mean, it was completely within FCC guidelines.  How about that?  How about that?  Yeah, I know.  Tell me about it. 
[01:09:30]  Well, we have that in common.  Yeah.  That's always fun.  But, you know, do you hold any grudge?  These are beautiful people.  And I'm sure we'll be talking down the road.  Yeah.  You know, I'll leave it at that.  But I have no gripes.  I'm a big boy.  And, you know.  Doesn't it piss you off, though, when they kind of buckle under because the groups come to their door or send some memo on a nice little letterhead saying we're going to boycott this or that?  Well, here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  You know, people like to believe what they read in the papers, and most of it's garbage. 
[01:10:00]  I was never fired from MS Communications.  MS was suing me toward the end of my contract.  And then they were also offering me a crap load of money to come back.  While I was sitting home in Pennsylvania, good morning, Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and begging me to come back, Clear Channel steps in at the height of the FCC, you know, whole quagmire when the little Negro girl pulled out her boobie.  And so they knew what they were getting.  They knew what they were getting.  And I knew what I was getting myself into to a small degree, to a small degree. 
[01:10:30]  So when people say, oh, you get fired, you get terminated, I look at it as I was freed from the machine.  I did a business deal with Clear Channel.  I'm like a modern-day Larry Davis.  I did a deal with the devil, plain and simple.  You think you're going to be looked at as somebody that's hard to work with?  In what capacity?  Radio?  You know, yeah, like you hire this guy.  It's just, you know, look at his track record.  It's going to be trouble.  Well, you know, people like to say that time heals all wounds and so on and so forth. 
[01:11:00]  You guys, I guess, this is where you wanted to be.  You wanted to do radio.  You wanted to come back to New York.  I'm not a radio guy.  I'm not an experienced guy who said, oh, I want to, you know, crack a mic one day and talk to people.  I'm here by way of business.  Yeah, but you've had success in the business.  I've been successful all my life.  I mean, in radio.  You've had some success there.  So, I mean, you know, you would think you would want to pursue that.  I've got some options on the table.  I've actually got a new deal right now, or actually a deal that I've had for a while with Music Choice.  You'll be able to see Star and Buckwild doing interviews and hosting a new show on Music Choice television. 
[01:11:30]  It's in 35 million homes.  So, I'm not starving for a job.  But radio is something that, you know, it's very different now.  It's very, very different.  And, you know, because of the pressure groups and the new affirmative action that's going on with the Arbitron system.  But we have the specs up the dial here.  The dial is being generated.  The dial is being generated in that direction.  You guys, no disrespect. 
[01:12:00]  You're going to have trouble beating the specs up the dial.  Well, there are a lot of Spanish language stations on the air, that's for sure.  About like John Lew saying what he said.  Never mind John Lew, man.  This is what bugs me about the whole perception of it.  Because when you say something, comics have been dealing with this forever.  When you say something in humor, it's held to a different standard.  Like, why is nobody coming out and accusing Gandolfini of being a murderer?  Yeah.  Or accusing somebody like De Niro of being a rapist because he attacked that girl in Cape Fear. 
[01:12:30]  That's understood to be under the context of their art.  And yet, when you say something, even if it's tasteless in humor, they come at you from a whole different angle.  Well, you know, it's like I said.  I mean, we can sit here and bang the drum all day about it's a new day in radio.  But it is what it is.  You have to, you know, get in, get your money while you can.  In my opinion, some folks want to get in and do it a little bit different.  Can I play the game of radio?  Absolutely.  As you just said, I've never had FCC fine and I wasn't fine over this thing.  But it's where we are now.  It's totally where we are now. 
[01:13:00]  Where are you on your own?  This is what I wanted to ask you.  Are you on your own dump button or is there somebody else on the dump button there?  That I can't speak about because I might have to speak to folks down the road one day.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  What, uh...  I got no gripes.  I'm not mad at nobody.  There isn't any real genuine hatred between you guys?  Between me and...  Uh, what's his name?  Envy.  Yeah.  D.J. Envy.  Yeah, D.J. Envy.  Envy is a nice guy who has helped my career.  And that's how you see it now?  Absolutely. 
[01:13:30]  But if he said something that you found so personally repulsive, would you want to just  kick his ass or...  Well, you know, I'm not a guy who needs to go settle things by way of violence.  I'm 42 years old.  I've passed that stage many, many years ago.  My mother was called a white, uh, lesbian prostitute on that station, uh, down the dial.  Did I get upset that I went to the police?  No.  My mother, is she white?  Yes.  Is she a lesbian?  No.  Prostitute?  No.  But it's, it's what it is.  It's hood talk.  It's chopping things up.  It's, it's getting at each other. 
[01:14:00]  You know, just like you guys, you sit here and you, uh, you get at the long-haired faggot.  You know what I'm saying?  You go back and forth and it's, it's what it is.  They bash each other.  Yeah.  That's it.  What do you say to the people that, uh, say that it was real easy to go after the guy's  kid, though?  His, uh, his four-year-old kid.  What do you say to the people who say it was easy to go after the guy's kid?  Good question, Jim.  No, you said what he said.  So I just phrased it like I kind of...  Well, I'm trying to find out where the kid is and all that.  I mean, it, it seemed pretty easy to do.  Hood talk, man.  Hood talk, you, I mean, you know, I mean, it, it, it's entertainment. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, if I were to sit here and say, uh, uh, you know, uh, why did Hitler commit suicide?  You would say, um, he took one look at the gas bill.  Come on, laugh it up.  You know?  It's entertainment.  Get over it.  Uh, when did you realize, like, you had that show that day.  When did you realize, like, all right, things are going really badly?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, when did that, uh-oh.  Because we know what that feels like when you go, oh, boy.  You want to talk?  Oh, boy.  You want to talk?  Yeah.  When did I realize things were getting bad?  When the long-haired faggot left and David Lee Roth came in and I said, hey, are we busting 
[01:15:00]  this cannon or what?  It's Thornbuck Wild time.  Are we busting this cannon or what?  Nothing happened.  We sat there.  We watched him, uh, do his, his nosedive.  O-P, O-N-A-O.  You guys call yourselves O-N-A now?  O-N-A.  That's, uh, O-N-A.  That's real gay.  I gotta tell you, by the way, it's real goddamn gay.  But anyway.  Wait, what is gay?  Yeah, O-N-A.  O-N-A.  It's better than O-P and Anthony.  You're trying to be tough.  You're really bothering me, to be honest with you.  I'm trying to be tough?  You really are.  I am tough blondie.  O-N-A's gay?  I am tough blondie. 
[01:15:30]  I heard you, matter of fact, a little while ago, since you want to talk about being tough,  this morning, I tuned into your show as I was coming in.  You started to tell a joke about your girlfriend who saw some, some blags, but you didn't want  to tell the joke.  Finish the joke.  I didn't.  I wasn't talking about my girlfriend this morning.  What was the joke?  That was you.  That was my girlfriend.  Finish the joke.  So figure out who's who, first of all.  We were looking out at the pool from the balcony.  Tell us the joke.  And it was a Baptist meeting in the hotel.  So the pool was, like, full of black people.  So it was the Cosby kids dropping the kids off at the pool joke. 
[01:16:00]  That's that.  Boom, boom.  Boom.  That made him laugh, so.  But what was the question you asked?  I forget.  What do you say to people?  You answered that question.  A lot of people said it was easy to go after the kid's four-year-old daughter.  Well, you know, there's a way in the world of rap music, hip-hop, where you go out.  Even Biggie Smalls went after people's kids, you know, shoot your daughter in the calf muscle, 
[01:16:30]  something, something, yada, yada, yada.  You know, but when you want to take something and magnify it, it can be seen as something  explosive.  And, again, not to go back into this, you know, I'm not into kids.  Never wanted to bother a guy's kid or even his Negro wife who was, you know, claiming  to be Asian or something like that, you know.  It still sounds like you got a beef.  It doesn't sound like the wounds have been healed.  No.  All right, let's say hi to Tony in Deer Park. 
[01:17:00]  Tony, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Tony.  Listen, Star.  Yeah, what's up, bro?  I think in Wine Dancer, the Chicken Delight, they're looking for some help.  Oh, yeah.  I could throw in a good application for you.  Good word.  No, thanks, buddy.  I actually own a property and buildings.  You can come work with me.  That's great, brother.  That's great.  I'll talk to you later.  Oh, man, who's out?  All right, let's say hi to Susanna in New York City.  Susanna.  Hello?  What's up, Susanna?  Star, listen, I reached out to you on the email.  Would you get back to me?  What's up, baby? 
[01:17:30]  No, I'm looking for, like, real estate investors.  You do more than just music, whatever, right?  I'm a developer.  Of course you are.  That's why I reached out to you.  Please get back to me.  I have money.  I have buildings.  Look for the email.  Savannah at ALO.com, all right?  Please get back to me.  What's your email address?  Oh, my God.  He didn't hear it.  What's your email address?  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  What's up?  We'll get to that one.  Hey, Star just said that he didn't go to the guys down the block because of that white prostitute comment.  What's that?  The white prostitute comment against his mother. 
[01:18:00]  The other guys down the block said that or whatever.  Down the dial.  Yeah.  But anyway, it was in the paper last week that his mother's suing for, like, $11 million for that comment.  Okay.  What's it got to do with me?  It's just crap.  It's just a comment, man.  You're saying to grow up and stuff like that.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, I just made a comment.  Exactly.  $11 million for a stupid comment.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  You know what it seems to me?  It's just a comment.  Anyway, hold on, hold on, hold on, man.  You know what it seems to me?  It seems like you're saying it's cool. 
[01:18:30]  It's just ghetto talk.  It's radio.  It's whatever it is.  It's street talk.  But then it seems like you do take certain things personally, but you're trying to blow them off.  Like, the pool crap bugged you enough where you came in and commented on it.  No, no, not at all.  It seems to me like it's cool unless it's coming back at you.  Where you can or where you can't go in terms of radio, where you're willing to go, where you're not willing to go.  But let me tell you something.  You've got to be willing to take some crap if you're going to dish it out.  Absolutely. 
[01:19:00]  I've been doing this since 2000.  I know.  I'm not new to this.  But, like, I see this underlying, you know, I'm going to throw this out, but when it comes back at me,  yeah, it does piss me off.  Like, I think you do get a little pissed off.  Well, you don't know me.  I don't know you.  If that's your interpretation, that's fine.  There are a lot of people who don't like the fact that I'm confident and aggressive.  You understand?  So let's be clear.  I'm not looking for a job.  And many people think that, oh, he's mad.  He's bitter.  That's not my grind right now.  I've got a book coming out.  My website's on buckwild.com. 
[01:19:30]  The people who have listened to my show, I've got listeners, not fans.  So people know, you know, my grind is a different grind.  Starring Buckwild is a cool name for a radio show, by the way.  That's a lot cooler than O&A.  Malik, what's up?  Got to give that one to you.  Malik, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Yo, Starr, what up?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Yo, listen, man.  I'm glad you got an envy because there's a lot of people at that other station that they do a lot of side talking.  You was the only real cat that got at that dude because that dude said a lot of fab things about you, too. 
[01:20:00]  Well, he's probably a nice kid.  Yeah, but he didn't want to take it, dude.  You know what I'm saying?  You gave him plenty of chances.  Like, yo, you don't want to see me on the radio and see me in the street.  And he didn't want to see you like that.  You know what I'm saying?  He know the game that he was playing.  He didn't want to play.  He chumped out.  He know what it's about.  Son, he kept it moving.  You played your cards right, son.  I thank you for listening, man.  All right, no problem.  See?  All right, let's say hi to Cigars and Scotch.  What's up, bro?  Hey, I just want to remind everyone that it's a new day in radio. 
[01:20:30]  So, thanks.  I need to say that another half a dozen times.  All right, let's go to Deanna in California.  What's up, Deanna?  Hi.  I just wanted to know, he thinks it's right that he offered money for someone to give the  name of the little girl's school.  It's just messed up.  You shouldn't do that.  You guys know that, okay, the pests, they go where they go with your stuff.  What if somebody really would have sent him the name of the school? 
[01:21:00]  Then what was he going to do?  I'm sorry, what'd she say?  The pest?  What'd she say?  The pest?  They're fans.  Was it a real...  I'll ask you what'd she say.  Was it a real offer that you wanted to end the school or just radio?  Come on, you're calling from California.  Knock it off.  First of all, I'm from Maryland.  I'm not from California.  Oh, okay.  I just live out here.  Oh, okay.  Second of all, it's just...  Why would you do...  You threatened this kid.  It's called entertainment, young lady.  No, it's not.  You listen to rap music?  Yeah.  It's all bang, bang, shoot him up, nigger, die slow.  Knock it off.  Knock it off.  You knock it off. 
[01:21:30]  Good comeback, miss.  I was terrific.  Way to straighten him out.  He's from Hazleton.  You're from Hazleton, Pennsylvania?  No, I'm not from Hazleton.  Yeah, you just said that.  I have a summer home there.  Come on, slow down.  A summer home there.  How old are you?  How old am I?  I'm 25.  Oh.  Thank you.  I think that...  I have a daughter and I just think that that...  I mean, your mom can defend herself.  Where's the father locked up?  She can go to.  Where's the father locked up?  Come on, slow down.  Who?  My daughter saw that?  Yeah.  He's not.  Oh. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Let's go to Tony.  You don't see that through like you talk about D-List and hip-hop and it's all bang,  bang, shoot him up and everything.  But at a couple of the radio stations, or which radio stations?  97 seems to be the one of the problems outside.  Yeah.  You don't see people kind of taking that to heart and maybe then, you know, what you said,  someone might have taken it seriously.  It's got nothing to do with me.  Yeah.  I've never seen anybody get shot over there, you know.  Because people are always telling us, look, you've got a responsibility on the air. 
[01:22:30]  And what you say, some people might take to heart and stuff.  So you say, you know, you're offering money up for this kid or to find this kid or something.  You don't think maybe one of your really desperate fans would maybe try to do that,  process that before you said it?  Here's the thing.  The district attorney's office, who was more than competent enough to determine what was  talk and what was real, made a ruling.  Right, because that's the direction it took. 
[01:23:00]  But did you ever think when you were saying that that it might have taken some other direction  where you get one of these listeners that are a little, you know, off their screw and  go off there and show up to the studio with a kid and go, here you go, here she is.  That was never the intention.  And people who know my show, you know, and the ratings, you know, spoke for themselves.  People know that there's times when we chop it up a little bit and there's times when  we have serious talk.  And I was just chopping it up.  Who started the whole thing between you two? 
[01:23:30]  What's that?  Who fired the first shot between you two?  Who started it?  I forget.  All right, let's go to Tony.  What's up, Tony?  Look, get this loser off the air.  Get this a little more interesting.  Don't give this guy any more time.  Say good morning to the bad guy.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  And the bad guy.  Well, I'll say one thing.  I like the fact that normally when stuff like this happens, you don't get to talk for a long  time and that he's out talking two and a half months or whatever it is after it happened  as opposed to not talking for a long time. 
[01:24:00]  Usually, you just got to sit quietly for a while.  I guess the clear channel checks stopped.  Actually, I just told you.  Just the positive one.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's usually they make you shut up, but they don't pay.  They say, you keep your mouth shut.  We'll keep the checks rolling.  Oh, and by the way, I don't have a non-compete clause.  The paper there, the Daily News.  What is that?  Page two or something like that?  Yeah.  They're talking about it.  Yeah.  Talking about I got a non-compete.  I can't go back.  I can go back on and I will be back on sooner than later.  Any hint where? 
[01:24:30]  I'd rather not say because I'm in this lawsuit with Fu Manchu, Councilman Liu, so I'm going  to play it safe until I actually sign off.  I'm sure that'll show up somewhere in that case.  All right.  Anything else there, Star?  I think we're good.  Star on buckwild.com.  I want to say good morning to everybody who has supported the journey of hate, and I'll  keep you posted.  Definitely.  Good to see you, guys.  The journey of hate.  The what?  The journey of hate. 
[01:25:00]  Objective hate.  Don't fool yourself.  All right, man.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for stopping in, bro.  All right.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Our duties do do do do do.  Our duties do do do do.  Our duties do do do have destructive power.  You think it stinks now.  You should have seen it a month ago.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:25:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's go to Rob in Boston.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, guys.  You know, that last 20 minutes of radio was pretty much useless.  I don't, you know, this guy comes in there acting like a tough guy.  You know, it looks like he sounded like he was auditioning for Radio Boise drive time.  Well, that's his shtick.  What are you going to do?  I'd much rather have listened to her about something about Starter's Taddy and some homo 
[01:26:00]  she was seeing in the lobby of a hotel.  Well, we'll get to that.  Yeah, we'll get to that, Rob.  There's still plenty of stories from our road trip.  Well, it's a big radio story, you know.  It was a great weekend up here, guys.  You know, you guys, all of those guys killed.  It was a great show.  I never laughed so hard.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  Let's go to Adam in New York.  What's up, Adam?  Hey, how you guys doing today?  Hey, man.  All right, Adam.  I got to tell you, I was let down.  The last guest you had there, if you can call him that.  I've been a long-time listener since Danny W days, and that guy was putting me to sleep. 
[01:26:30]  Well, it's a big story.  It wasn't a huge story.  He was arrested, dude.  It is a big radio story.  It's a big news story.  I mean, you have the guy on.  You don't know what to expect.  I don't know.  So when you have people like him on, you don't know what to expect.  Is it going to be like the radio guy, or is it going to be like the real guy?  I didn't like that he's trying to be tough and confrontational.  It's like, dude, you know, you're in the newspaper today.  It's a really big radio story. 
[01:27:00]  Let's discuss it.  And instead, he's like, you know, you guys have been outdone and kissed the ring.  I was like, ugh.  Yeah, he's throwing out like radio shtick kind of stuff.  And this is stuff I said to him, so I'm not trying to talk, you know, all tough now that  he's not here.  But that was just like...  No, no.  We'll only bring up what was brought up on the air.  He certainly did speak your mind.  That was it.  I actually probably was right.  I didn't take it like that.  I took it like he was trying to be funny.  But again, I think you were probably right.  And, you know, you said what you wanted to say, which was good, man.  I think he's got like a persona. 
[01:27:30]  You know, because seriously, I never listened.  It's completely out of my demo, you know.  So I don't know if his on-air persona is like a tough guy.  I would assume because of what he was fired for that it is, you know.  I don't know.  I just...  I thought we would get a little more out of him about, you know, his feelings on being  fired or clear channel or freedom of speech or something like that. 
[01:28:00]  But, I don't know, it seemed to be a little more about just what's going on with him.  So, whatever.  I always...  A lot of people come in here, I think, come into the show and expect it to be a certain  vibe.  They're not really that familiar with the show.  And they kind of feel like the best defense is a good offense.  Like, I'm not...  Yeah, yeah, right.  These idiots get the best of me and make fun of me.  Yeah, so come in like...  People don't want to come in here and be mistreated.  Yeah.  So they immediately think they have to launch the defensive.  Basically, we pushed back and he stopped because he really wanted to get something going.  He wanted to get real confrontational, you know, saying O&A's a gay name when your show's 
[01:28:30]  called Starn Buckwild, you know?  In the community.  And is O&A really that gay sounding?  I mean, Opie and Anthony stinks.  That's why, you know, a lot of the fans have adopted O&A.  Stinks.  Oh, the name stinks.  It's a name I...  Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?  Open him in the knee and have an amp on him in the knee.  We're the first ones to tell you it stinks.  I haven't called Opie since I was 12.  It's not even a radio name.  It's been my awful nickname my entire life.  And even the fans realize how bad it is, so they start calling us O&A. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  They like the O&A a lot better.  And to say that's gay, it's like, yeah, all right, I get what you're getting at.  But it's not going to happen here, so stop.  And let's talk about what's going on with you and what's happening in the newspaper.  Opie was actually a name that was given to him by an older gentleman in the neighborhood  who drove a van with no windows.  Anyway, so I don't know what we accomplished there.  Good luck to Star.  I'm sure his next radio job will be terrific. 
[01:29:30]  Can't wait.  We have more stories from the O&A traveling virus.  Yeah, that Patty one's pretty good.  Yeah, which one?  There's a couple of them.  Well, we had a, like...  Her whole damn weekend.  Well, the O&A Village was, uh, it was like a high school play, to be honest with you.  Yeah, it was like a high school production.  If anything was lacking during that, it wasn't the comics, it wasn't the production.  The show itself... 
[01:30:00]  The show itself...  ...was amazing.  Right, went off without a hitch.  Almost flawless.  The comics, very funny.  Every one of them, uh, people had a great time.  And I'll be honest, you know, the one thing we haven't said, we had, what, eight comedians  on the bill?  Yeah.  We didn't know if our listeners, our fans, whatever, would sit through eight comedians.  Yeah.  And, uh, what was it, like three and a half hours?  It started around 7.30, court eight, and it went to 11, 11.15.  We didn't think they would sit there, uh, for that long laughing, but they did all the  way to the end.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  All the way to the end.  And a couple adjustments, that's all we're thinking about as far as the PNC Arts Center show  goes, but, uh, the ONA, uh, Village...  Yeah, that was the only part of this whole thing that we're like, that needs a little  revamping, a little, uh, thought put to it.  You know, this was the first one.  We're trying to get something going.  And, uh, yeah, like Opie said, it was like a high school play.  High school production or something.  Production.  We got some work ahead of us as far as the ONA Village goes.  Who said it was a bad manger scene? 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Man.  Well, we just, we came up with this concept.  A big, fat, bald baby Jesus with nine toes.  We came up with this concept, uh, for a petting zoo.  And, uh, yeah, you know, we got to work on it.  But we had to, like, get the people up to Worcester.  Yeah.  And one of them was Stalker Patty.  We had to, we had to pay for her bus fare.  Bus fare up to Worcester is what?  How much?  $38 or something.  $38 one way, because nobody wanted to drive her.  I begged everybody to try to drive her up there.  Oh, who the hell wants to, uh, have her in your car? 
[01:31:30]  Because she, Bob Saget, I was talking to backstage, and she begged me.  She was like, I want to meet Bob Saget.  I'm just too scared to talk to him.  So I'm talking to Bob, and, uh, he was a very friendly dude.  Oh, yeah.  So I'm just, you know, I'm like, this is Patty.  And he just kind of got the creeps from her.  Because she was like a tall aunt.  And he's like, I'm like, could she have a picture with you?  And of course, she's like, you're one of my heroes from America.  Because, and Bob made me stand between him and her for the picture.  I took a picture with Patty, and I had to stand between the two of them. 
[01:32:00]  Patty, you stink, and you annoyed Bob Saget.  He hates you.  Yeah.  What was torture also is, like, I had a caller about a half dozen times to, like, set this  whole thing up.  And you know her phone's not ringing.  No.  So, like, whenever she gets a call, she's so happy to speak to somebody.  Oh, hi.  Yeah.  Kenny, how are you?  Yeah.  And the worst was, though, the morning after the show, like, you know, we had our big day,  big show, a lot of running around, very busy. 
[01:32:30]  You know, got...  Well, before you tell that, but Anthony said he ran as a star to Patty, and she was just  amazed by the hotel room.  You're going through the end of the story.  We have to, like, go through the whole thing.  Someone said, it sounded like she was in Hawaii, how excited she was.  She was so excited to be at the Worcester Crowne Plaza Hotel.  This thing, and believe me, the Crowne Plaza might sound fancy.  We couldn't wait to get the hell out of there.  It's like a Days Inn.  You know, it's like a Days Inn type of place.  It's not a fancy schmancy hotel. 
[01:33:00]  It's in Worcester.  And Patty, I see her when I walk in, and she's like, I love the accommodations.  It's like accommodations.  She goes, I couldn't believe it.  I went into my room, and they have a coffee maker right in the room.  Well, the first thing I did was make myself a cup of coffee.  Patty has...  I was stunned.  She has no filter in her head where she realizes people are looking at her going, no one cares. 
[01:33:30]  No one cares.  You're an idiot.  She doesn't understand that internally we're tolerating her because we're fighting the urge  to bite her face.  Oh, for someone to be so thrilled with a coffee maker in their hotel room, like...  Wait, what did she say about the coffee?  Like, I should have what?  She goes, she was amazed.  She goes, I right away made myself a cup of coffee.  Did you?  That's how that discussion should have went. 
[01:34:00]  I could see her in there with the pot.  Okay, fill up to here.  Just a big dopey smile on her face.  Oh, look, and the coffee's right here, right here, the packet, but look, a filter's supplied.  They give you shampoo right in the shower.  What, really, Patty?  Jesus, she is just an unknowing...  She's 52, I think now, a virgin, and has such little knowledge of the world and what  goes on on this planet, that hotels... 
[01:34:30]  Have you ever been to a hotel that didn't have at least a coffee maker in the room?  Or, if you step up a notch, you call downstairs and they'll bring you a cup of coffee if they  don't have it in the room.  Well, that's what I was going to get at, too, because no one makes the coffee in their  room.  I mean, you do out of necessity, like, oh, I'm tired, I need something to get me going.  Yeah.  The coffee in the room stinks.  But that's a lot of people that are going on vacation with their kids and stuff, staying  at the Days Inn, a businessman that's, you know, going all over the country.  You stay at these smaller hotels, the coffee maker's in the room. 
[01:35:00]  It's not this big, luxurious item, is what I was getting at.  You know who else loves a coffee maker in the room?  Loves...  Stupid Voss.  Really?  Loves a coffee maker in the room.  Well, that figures.  You gotta have coffee in the room.  I don't have to pay extra for it.  So, Kenny and I were having breakfast in the morning, and Kenny goes, Sturker Patty has  a gentleman friend.  Yeah.  A gentleman friend?  Now, this woman is afraid of men.  She's a virgin.  Never been with a man before.  Doesn't know how to meet men or anything. 
[01:35:30]  How does she meet some guy in Worcester?  For all we know, she could be fooling us since she was turning tricks there.  Patty's a prostitute.  That'd be great.  Well, the girl in the gift shop, we have no doubt in our mind.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That she was turning tricks.  Wait, the girl right there?  Huh?  No doubt in my mind.  No doubt in Kenny's mind.  We went in to get some papers, and I guess we found out later that she's not even the  regular girl.  Yeah.  So, she was taking advantage of working at the hotel for the day.  Black girl?  White girl? 
[01:36:00]  White trash.  White trash, basically.  With a little color.  White trash with a little color.  Jimmy's going back.  Affordable.  That turns you on, right?  That turns you on, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah, because we go in to get the papers, and she's like, where are you guys from?  And she's asking a lot of questions, and smiling, and when are you leaving, and all this stuff  that was kind of uncomfortable.  And we leave there, I go, Kenny, she's turning tricks.  When she charged you 50 bucks for the paper you knew.  Right, right.  Asked for your room number.  Putting up that stupid clock thing, like, I'll be back in, and it's always like 15, 20 minutes 
[01:36:30]  later, whatever.  Yeah.  And probably running into rooms and, you know, doing what she's got to do.  Oh, dude, I'm really happy.  I'm telling you, man.  You should have told me that.  I would have walked right in there.  What are you doing?  Just counting some money.  We should have called Jimmy, because he would have got to the bottom of it, right?  He certainly would have.  And then, sure enough, we're in the lobby, and all of a sudden, she puts the sign up,  just like we were joking, and she's off.  So we don't know what she's doing.  Yeah, maybe had an appointment.  But there was something going on, because she was way too friendly in the gift shop. 
[01:37:00]  But I was meeting Opie for breakfast, so I got down there before him.  And you know how, like, you're just groggy.  You just woke up.  You don't want to be bothered.  I'm hungry.  I just want to eat, all right?  And my big welcoming committee was Patty.  Great.  So I'm, like, happy.  And, you know, I got the biggest.  Hi, Kenny.  Good morning.  Rise and shine.  I see you're an early riser like me, you know.  And then she's going to have a beautiful buffet. 
[01:37:30]  Like, she's like the maitre d'.  Yeah, she's the hostess.  Yeah, yeah.  Inviting you over to the hotel's buffet.  And, you know, it was just a bunch of crap sausage links and, you know.  Yeah, the usual.  Yeah, you know.  And then she goes, oh, why don't you join us?  So I look at the dining room and it's, like, basically empty.  So I'm looking for the us because.  Well, the us lives in our head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But at this particular time, there was another person involved. 
[01:38:00]  Because I didn't recognize, like, one face.  I thought maybe, you know, somebody I would recognize, a familiar face.  Yeah, a pest or something.  And I go, us?  And she goes, I met the gentleman friend at the show last night.  Uh-oh.  So I look over there.  It's, like, an average, like, gray-haired looking guy, maybe in his 50s, you know.  And she's like, why don't you join us?  I go, Patty, you're on a date.  I don't want to C-block you.  Right.  She goes, oh, we just met.  I go, Patty, you got a hotel room. 
[01:38:30]  You got to do what you got to do, you know.  And then I notice she's wearing a man's polo shirt.  Really?  And I'm going, Patty, what are you doing?  And it's oversized.  It's too big.  It's the just slept with a guy, like, look.  Yeah.  And she goes, oh, it's nothing.  I was cold.  He lent it to me.  I'm like, yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Well.  Well, we got to get Patty on the phone now.  What's going on there?  Let's get Patty on the phone and see what that's all about.  And another annoying thing is, she must have had problems with her cell phone. 
[01:39:00]  Because, like, every half hour on the hour, I was getting phone calls from Stalker Patty  going, am I talking to a real person or is this my voicemail?  Oh, my God.  What a retard.  I was there.  That definitely happened.  She has to ask the voicemail if it's real.  Yeah.  She goes, am I talking to a real person or is this my voicemail?  Did you go, please press one for your voicemail?  You should have said, this is your voicemail.  I've never actually had someone speak to me before. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  It's the only reason I've never answered.  This is your first message.  Hi, voicemail.  All right.  We got to take a quick break to catch up.  Yeah.  We're really late today.  So one show down.  We got three or four to go.  Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  All the pictures are being added to opiananthony.com.

[01:41:00]  She only has a couple minutes.  Let's go to Stalker Patty.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Kristen Bell will be in studio in a couple minutes there.  But first, Stalker Patty.  What's up, Patty?  Hey, how are you?  I heard you were talking about the travel and virus.  I had a great time over the weekend.  And thank you for putting me there and everything.  We had no choice, Patty.  We had no choice, Patty.  Well, I really appreciate it.  You liked the hotel, huh? 
[01:41:30]  It was really nice.  I was fascinated by the coffee pot in the room.  And knowing me and coffee, I was so happy with that.  Oh, my God.  I never saw a coffee pot in a hotel room before.  Never.  But then again, I've not seen too many hotel rooms, either.  You know.  Love to break into a room and hit her over the head with a coffee pot.  Just bludgeoned.  She's found bludgeoned by a coffee pot.  Patty, everyone wants to know if you got some ass.  Yep.  On Saturday night. 
[01:42:00]  Get some action.  If I got the what?  Of course.  Why would she know?  Did you have sex?  Action.  Did you get any action with your male friend?  Yeah, you were having breakfast with this male friend of yours.  Oh, I just met him on the Sunday morning yesterday.  He was eating breakfast, and I was getting mine.  And he came over and says, hi, may I buy you breakfast, Patty?  I looked at him, and we just met.  I think his name is George.  You know, he's a retired guy, and he was traveling, and he's making two of the shows. 
[01:42:30]  Retired guy traveling.  Man, this guy was desperate.  This guy's just looking for tail.  He's like, all right, let me look around down here.  Oh, crap.  Well, it's worth a shot, I guess.  Well, it's her or a poached egg.  Right.  It was nice making a new friend, and I really enjoyed his company.  And when he comes to New York.  She just babbles and babbles and babbles.  Kenny and I were having, like I said, breakfast in one of the booths.  And by the time I got down, we could hear Patty across the entire restaurant. 
[01:43:00]  And there were a bunch of people now sitting, because everyone started coming down together, I guess.  And all you could hear is Patty's just voice that goes right through you.  And I didn't know he bought you breakfast.  I want my 20 bucks back.  Yeah, because Patty's sitting there enjoying the buffet.  Yeah.  And she's crying poverty to Kenny every chance she gets.  She needs money for the bus ride.  Yeah.  So, and the buffet was like.  I promised her the bus ride.  Yeah, yeah.  But she needed money for the bus ride. 
[01:43:30]  And then she said she only had $4.  No, $11 to her name.  I said, you got money to go home?  Oh, I did, yeah.  She goes, I only got $11 to my name.  So, how are you going to pay for the buffet, Patty?  Which was, I believe, $19?  Right.  $19, yeah.  So, how did you expect to pay for that?  Oh, I was, before I went inside, I was sitting in the chair, and Kenny came over to me, and, you know, he gave me back my car fare for the bus.  So, I was able to use that, but then I didn't have to, because he treated me. 
[01:44:00]  And then I used it for lunch instead, because I didn't have any food at home yet, so I figured I'd eat a meal.  Oh, there's always a story.  Shut up.  And don't have to worry about it.  Every time he talked to her, you know, I will, I refuse to feel sorry for you, Patty.  You're pathetic, and I love it.  I love it.  So, why were you wearing the guy's shirt?  Because I was cold and shivering, so he was nice enough to go out to his car and get his extra shirt. 
[01:44:30]  She was cold and shivering.  I gave her my shirt, placed him over her quaking shoulders.  It's air conditioning.  It's too cold sometimes.  All right, Patty, there's more to the story, but we've got to cut you off.  We've got a big Hollywood star.  Yeah.  I don't need you anymore.  Okay, I respect that.  What was your favorite?  Oh, you respect that?  Thanks, Patty.  I appreciate it.  You respect that.  Do you?  Yes, I do.  You dope.  I'm not a dope.  Okay, well, anyway. 
[01:45:00]  We're going to get into that maybe tomorrow.  I mean, some of these side characters getting a little too big for their britches.  Yeah.  I mean, we haven't even talked about Twitchell's breaking down and crying and spending the whole  night in his room instead of at the ONA traveling virus.  He lost his mind.  And was crying in front of Anthony.  And I saw it.  That's one of many stories we still have to tell.  But, Stalker Patty, you respect the fact that we have to go to a Hollywood star instead of talk to you some more, right?  Yes, that's awesome.  That's awesome.  All right, Patty.  All righty. 
[01:45:30]  What was your favorite part, by the way?  Oh, I had a great time, and I'm looking forward to it.  What was your favorite part of the ONA traveling virus in Worcester, Massachusetts?  Oh, being in the pet thing there and forgetting to throw a little hay back at Paul.  Die.  Back at Paul.  Well, let's get Kristen Bell in. 
[01:46:00]  Isn't she annoying?  That Patty is just...  There's more to that story, though.  How does she get the shirt on?  Yeah.  How does she get the...  Wow, wait.  Hi, Kristen.  Hi, how are you?  The PalTalk camera.  What a creepy.  Is he setting it up?  Look.  I know.  This is a camera for the website.  People watch us online.  That's a flight of the navigator.  Yeah.  Creepy.  Well, you got your hair done, so we figured we'd show you off a little bit.  Okay.  I heard you were getting your hair done for radio, huh?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, I do my hair every morning, no matter what I'm doing.  Very nice.  No.  Good rule of thumb to follow. 
[01:46:30]  Well, you're in the new movie.  Now we're just going to...  Wait, what happened?  Nothing.  There's going to be no talking to her.  We're very ineffective.  We're horrible interviewers when pretty girls are in here because we instantly turn into  junior high school boys that couldn't talk to pretty girls.  Every bit of low self-esteem kind of comes rushing forward, and it's just like three dummies  who can't make eye contact.  For example, Whoopi was on our show last Thursday.  No problem whatsoever.  I could still be talking to her.  It was like talking to a family member. 
[01:47:00]  It was like no distractions whatsoever.  And look, you sit Indian style on the couch, all cute.  I'm getting comfortable.  Is that it?  I'm getting ready.  I'm warming up.  You're warming up.  You were actually in...  I was just reading your bio.  You worked with one of my friends.  You were in Poodie Tang.  Not exactly critically acclaimed, but Louis directed as Louis C.K.  Louis directed that?  Yes, he did.  He's a director?  Well, yeah.  He was Chris Rock's head writer for a while, so I think Chris and Chris have a good relationship.  And he directed Poodie Tang, which a lot of people compared to Raging Bull. 
[01:47:30]  He was wonderful.  He kept me in the film, actually, because my part was cut.  I was like 19 at the time, and my part was cut, and he kept me in the credits.  Oh, nice.  Yes.  At least in the credits.  At least.  Why not?  You still got paid, right?  I think so.  Yes, you made $100.  I did.  I think I made about $100.  But you know what?  The funny thing is, more people have seen that movie than, I mean, I could even count.  I'm recognized more off of that, because it was printed repeatedly on HBO, and everyone  loves it.  Oh, yeah, one of those movies. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Let me ask you a question, because I do a little acting, and I don't say that to be humble.  I mean, I just do a very minimal amount.  What is your, like, when you act, what is the thing that, like, you think you suck out  the most, or that screws you up the most as, like, an actor?  Like, for me, it's all dialogue.  Thank you.  That hurts.  How did that bump?  Because it was serious?  That's true.  Because you were just being right?  I was actually thinking about it.  No, I'm actually decent at dialogue.  You know what? 
[01:48:30]  Actually, on Friday night, we shot a scene.  We started it at 3.30 in the morning, and it was because it was the end of our day that  involved me saying the alphabet backwards, and somehow I managed to do it in one take.  And that's the end of the day?  That was the end of the day.  We started at, like, 8 a.m.  Have you done, like, kissing scenes and stuff?  Because I had to do one kissing scene, and it was really, like, freaked me out and was  uncomfortable.  Because it was, what was his name?  Well, no, that was just to get the part.  I did a short independent comedy, and I had to kiss Nina Hartley, who was a very legendary 
[01:49:00]  porn star.  Did you see Boogie Nights?  Yeah.  She was the girl who William Macy shot.  Oh, the one that was playing the wife.  We were having sex with guys in the driveway.  Yeah.  She's a very legendary porn star, so I had to make out with her at the end of a short  comedy, which I kind of remembered her career.  I was like, oh, good.  A kiss.  Did you Purell your mouth?  No.  I think she did.  I was really insulted.  She was very nice, though, but I was like, have you ever kissed somebody on screen?  She is horrified.  Do you understand what she's getting at?  Of course.  That's why I mentioned it.  I mean, like, you've kissed people on screen.  Yes.  Do you use tongue when you kiss in a movie? 
[01:49:30]  No.  Well, one time, one movie I did, somebody used tongue on me, and it caught me completely  by surprise.  Whoa.  Because there's sort of like an unspoken rule that you kiss.  It was one of the grips.  Yeah.  And it was, like, in this alley, and it was weird.  But you don't use, you just don't use tongue, and you sort of, like, talk about it.  Like, there's always this awkward moment where you'd be like, hey, are you cool with everything  today?  And the guy would be like, yeah, are you?  Oh, boy.  Do you want to change anything?  And it's sort of, it's very strange.  And then everyone's looking at you, and everyone's sweating, and I'm sweating. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  I once kissed my grandma with my mouth open.  That's not right.  I was young.  I didn't know.  It's a true story.  It was horrible.  I was kissing her goodnight, and my mouth was wide open as I was moving in for the kiss.  And she yelled at me and told me to shut my mouth.  Whoa.  She wasn't into it.  That was embarrassing.  She shot at his first rejection.  And this is the thing.  This is where my instincts are great.  I figured I'd kiss my mom and dad like that. 
[01:50:30]  I mean, grandma's only once removed there.  Nothing.  This is horrible.  Terrible people in this room.  I walked into the dressing room, and I had never done a kissing scene.  I didn't know how to do it.  And I didn't want that moment that she's talking about.  So I walked in.  I said to Nina, like, look, I've never kissed a girl on screen.  I don't know how to do it.  But do we, like, use, do we kiss kiss or do we not?  And she said, well, we're supposed to be attracted to each other.  And she pushes me against the wall, and she makes out with me in the dressing room.  Just so we get.  She was like, let's practice.  Let's practice, which I imagine doesn't happen.  But she's a porn star, so it's not like, yeah. 
[01:51:00]  And we're kissing.  Well, she's method, so it's fine.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like you're going to get the same reaction from Meryl Streep.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, we have to kiss in the scene.  I would say that to her, and she'd just lean over and throw open a bucket.  And I'm like, all right, I'll see you on the set.  But Nina, actually, while we were kissing in front of the whole crew, she took my hand  and she put it on her chest, and she went, go ahead.  You know you want to.  Do it while you can.  And she put my hand on her and made me laugh, and then I was very relaxed.  It worked, yeah.  Well, maybe now you can take some of that advice away from this show. 
[01:51:30]  Sure.  I'll try that on Veronica Mars.  Yeah.  I haven't seen that, but I see ads for it all over the city.  Yeah, well, because the CW is the merger of Warner Brothers and UPN, and so they sort of  launched the new network, so there's ads everywhere.  That's what CW is.  See?  They're confusing people.  Yeah, because I saw that on a poster yesterday.  They're not explaining it.  And what does CW mean?  Who knows?  Nobody knows.  Oh, you don't know yet?  Nope.  Okay, I got it.  All right.  We're just going to make it up as we go.  Well, the new movie is Pulse.  Yes, it is.  And it's a horror movie. 
[01:52:00]  It's scary.  And it involves, like, technology.  Yeah.  It's sort of about a computer virus that starts affecting people.  It's sort of like the whole idea of Wi-Fi and how everything can travel through the air  and that it starts affecting people's minds and really messing.  That's why I wear tinfoil under my hat.  Like, you wear tinfoil, and it keeps the rays and waves from getting into your brain  because they'll control you.  He's kidding, but if you knew him, you'd understand how everyone in this room kind of can definitely  see him doing that. 
[01:52:30]  He's kidding slash really crazy.  Did you see most of us try to look under his cap real fast while he was saying that?  Because we know something's going on with him.  We just haven't figured it out yet.  No, I'm a normal guy.  I've been trying to figure it out for 12 years.  You know how embarrassing it is to talk to a beautiful girl and realize you have a  Breathe Right strip on your nose?  Oh, I was like, that's all, every word that was coming out of your mouth, I was looking  at the Breathe Right going, oh, do I feel like an ass?  And I'm just thinking, what is she thinking?  I was wondering if it was just like a nude Biore strip or something.  What she's probably thinking is, what is that mess under the Breathe Right strip? 
[01:53:00]  I'm really embarrassed.  I think we'd have like a chemistry, we're both actors.  We are terrible like that.  We've had very hard times.  That's right.  You guys are so hard on yourself.  Pretty girl.  Yeah.  It's just really hard to talk to pretty girls.  Most of our audience is not like you.  Most of our audience is, let's see, I'm going to look at Kenny.  On a beer belly.  Picture him a foot and a half shorter and 300 pounds wider.  That's what most of our audience is like.  And our female part of the audience, picture him. 
[01:53:30]  Excellent.  Pretty much, yeah.  But less feminine.  Hey, can we ask Kristen Bell, what do you think?  Does he have some black in him?  We're trying to figure it out.  He says he was Thomas Jefferson's...  This little white kid right here?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, let me explain.  Exactly, little white kid.  He's related to Thomas Jefferson, swear to God.  His family did the genealogy.  And Thomas Jefferson, it's known, has some black ancestors because he was...  A slave owner.  Yeah, a slave owner, and he fooled around with some of the slaves.  And we're thinking, perhaps, because of his hair... 
[01:54:00]  I don't know.  I'm not buying it.  I'm from Detroit.  Yeah.  Yeah, which is really...  I read that, and I'm like, wow.  I'm not buying that, yeah.  You don't look like you're from Detroit.  No.  Well, no, I don't, but I am.  Is there a good part of Detroit?  No.  Oh, no?  There's a few.  Yeah, there's a few okay parts.  Are you giving back to the community?  I'm trying.  I don't really know what I can do.  I go back a lot.  Do you wave when you fly over to L.A.?  Is that it?  Yeah.  I'm giving back.  I support the Red Wings.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  See? 
[01:54:30]  We're on in Detroit now.  You're being heard.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Say hi.  Oh, excellent.  Hi.  Hi, Detroit.  There you go.  Give some love.  But we haven't really discussed the movie that much.  So it's a horror movie.  It's technology.  It's the Wi-Fi.  Yeah.  And then, like, it seems like people from the other side are starting to communicate this  way, right?  Yeah, and they start coming through the Wi-Fi.  Because the preview looks great.  You know what?  It's pretty freaky.  There's no blood and guts, but it's definitely creepy and scary.  Doesn't need blood and guts anymore.  No.  Because I'll tell you something.  I didn't mind.  Things like the old slasher movies never got to me. 
[01:55:00]  This whole new genre of this thing that'll go and show up real quick flash on a video  screen.  Oh, that email is so creepy.  I just start like a girl.  I can't take that stuff.  It scares the crap out of me.  Well, you know what it is?  It's because, like, when, like, the beginning horror movies, like Alfred Hitchcock and the  whole idea of, like, the monster threatening normalcy, like, everybody, like, pushed the  envelope so much, like, show more blood and guts, show more blood and guts as Americans.  And now you can see people decapitated, and it's like, no big deal. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, you're totally immune to that.  Yeah, desensitized.  So now people are getting back to the psychological aspect of it, which this movie, there's definitely  some scary imagery in it, but it's just freaky because it proposes the idea about if  Wi-Fi is everywhere, then something that travels through Wi-Fi can get it.  It can get to you anywhere, and there's no safe spots.  You know what?  Creepiest scene ever, and I still can't watch it, and it has nothing to do with blood and  guts, is from The Shining, those two goddamn little girls in the hallway, when they just 
[01:56:00]  flash on them.  Can you say GD on the radio?  Yeah.  The GD word.  Can you say the S word?  No.  Good, because I almost said it when I came in.  Really?  And I realized it.  Say it.  That would have loosened us up.  That's a good word.  Could you say it, please?  In a half hour, we can even say the F word and the S word and whatever we want.  You lie.  And the C word.  We go to the one they use in England a lot.  Yeah.  We go to XM, satellite.  We can say whatever we want.  Yeah.  You can say whatever you want.  Whatever we want, about whoever we want.  Wait till you hear what we say about you. 
[01:56:30]  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I have satellite.  That was me trying to be charming and failing miserably.  She's got it in her, man.  She's got a potty mouth.  Yeah, she's definitely dead.  Potty mouth.  You can tell.  You can tell she's got a potty mouth.  Detroit.  You probably had to hang.  And she did a great decapitation reference.  How do you not love this girl?  I think she and I, like, I'm not going to put words in your mouth, but I think there's  like a chemistry.  Shut up.  What?  You ass.  It is.  It's pretty strong.  It's like your seat's just going to roll right over to my red couch here.  He's been on Leno a few times. 
[01:57:00]  You know, he's in the biz.  He's on HBO, Lucky Louie.  Oh, yeah, I'm on Louie.  Sunday nights, 1030.  You know, I just saw it, and I love it.  Cool.  Yeah.  He's the guy with that.  He's the creep.  He's the creepy guy.  The one that, like.  I haven't seen you on it yet, but I've only seen one episode.  Which one did you see?  Do you remember?  Where the little girl was screaming, and they made, she danced to some really sexy song.  Okay, that, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was when Louie, oh, yeah.  That was pretty funny.  And also with the mom got mugged.  That was pretty inappropriate.  Okay, yeah.  I was in those, but I wasn't a big player, apparently. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, that chemistry is really flowing, Jim.  Maybe I went and got some popcorn.  When you, when you, when I was on, this is the, this is who I am in the show.  I've lost a lot of weight since then.  Oh, I am loving this.  You know what?  I love this.  You have your breathe right strip on.  No, no.  That's why I didn't recognize you.  Yeah, take off the strip so she, maybe she can recognize you, Jimmy.  I'll tell you who I was.  Oh, I love seeing you put in your place.  Oh.  Oh.  When you were watching Lucky Louie, there's a time where you went internally, and you don't  know why, you went, ugh.  That's probably when I was on. 
[01:58:00]  I was wearing a brown sweater, and I delivered every line like this.  Ba-da-line.  Ba-da-line.  And I bugged my eyes out.  Ba-da-ba-line.  So, that's who I am.  If you looked at somebody and said, who is that vaudeville idiot, that was probably me.  Hey, we got a question from Bethlehem.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just had a question for Kristen about the movie itself.  It's actually, if I'm not wrong, it's a remake of a Japanese horror film with the same title. 
[01:58:30]  Japanese taking over the horror genre.  They really are.  Absolutely.  Wait, so this is a remake?  Well, it's based on the Japanese.  Well, it's based on Cairo, yeah.  Okay.  Right.  It's actually, you know, in the same vein as The Grudge.  And I was just going to ask her if she'd seen the original film and how she felt the two  compared.  I did see the original, actually.  And I think, I didn't see it until after I had read the American version.  I think what they did as far as, if you watch the other, Cairo, for an American audience, 
[01:59:00]  they would view it as more of a series of vignettes because there's more characters than  an American audience is used to.  There's like three different girls and two different guys.  And then there's all these sort of subplots that tangle that I think maybe the Japanese  are used to following more.  And so in order to sort of commercialize it a little bit more for the masses here, they  combined and they condensed a lot of it.  So it's still the same.  They use a lot of the same imagery, like that whole idea of the computer being in the computer,  being in the computer.  We replicated some of those shots, but we just basically condensed the characters. 
[01:59:30]  And it's, we speak English in it.  Does it have like a major difference?  Yeah.  Like Anthony Ruffridge, that, that, and something appears, that creepy, like shop camera stuff,  which is really hard.  Where it looks like somebody's walking and it's kind of in fast motion.  Like a spliced film.  Like what they did, does it have any of that?  Yeah, it has a lot of that.  Actually, well.  That scares the crap out of me.  Can't watch it.  You know what?  The cool thing, and I don't know if you, sir, who are online, what's his name? 
[02:00:00]  What's your name?  He's gone now.  Oh, he's gone.  Yeah, we didn't need him anymore.  Well, hopefully he's still listening.  And he hasn't.  Yeah, he's listening.  Yeah, okay, good.  There's nothing else to do.  In the original one, they really didn't use any CGI at all.  It was all just shadows, which I think is kind of cool, you know, because it's really  distracting.  Yeah, completely.  But here, we didn't use a ton of CGI, but basically we put, it was shot in Romania, so  actually all the phantoms we used were just Romanians painted white.  Romanians?  Head to toe.  White, really white Romanians. 
[02:00:30]  I guess that keeps the cost down, huh?  Yeah.  Sitting in Romania.  But you know what?  It was really freaky, but they harness this one girl, and they let her sort of fall to  the ground, and they slow the film down, so it's not really any sort of alteration to  the film.  She just falls, and her body moves really weird, and it's like one of the creepiest parts  of the movie.  I like the fact that you did Romanians.  That makes me really happy.  Like, they were having a meeting, and they're like, who will let us spray paint them white?  Someone said the Romanians.  You could do anything to these people.  Oh, these poor people.  I mean, it was actually a wonderful experience being over there, but the poor people, they got paid 
[02:01:00]  like $8 a day.  I mean, it was just awful.  Really?  It's hard to make a movie over there, because you know the standards that they're used to,  and you know the standards that we're used to, and it was just incomparable.  Are they bad?  Yeah, they're awful.  They didn't have craft service.  It was just peanuts.  Oh, my God.  But how do you pull manual labor as a crew without getting food during the day?  Well, did the actors have food?  No.  Wow.  Wow.  When we filmed our TV commercial recently, we had lots of food.  Yes.  Yes, we just did that. 
[02:01:30]  I wouldn't know about that.  We're in the biz, too.  But when I shot mine recently, I didn't have food.  I had to shoot my commercial like a week ago.  Just breathe right strips.  I didn't have any.  Yes, well, they were free.  They have like a little pool.  Breathe right strips.  Multicolored.  I was trying to figure out what to do with my hands during the commercial.  During the commercial?  During the commercial.  Yeah, because it's very hard to figure out.  Hand on hip?  This is what I do in pictures.  One hand on the hip.  That's good.  And you look really relaxed, but you kind of all start showing your waistline.  You're like a little teapot.  Short and stout?  But not short and stout.  I was trying to be charming again.  Every time you try to be charming, you insult her. 
[02:02:00]  I insult her.  I didn't know what you meant.  You're pretty in the face.  That's something I would say.  You have a great head.  Hey, we got a couple questions here.  BCH from Wack Bag.  BCH.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up?  You know, if the monster's coming to get me over Wi-Fi,  I got a great safe spot to hide.  It's about six feet away from my wireless router.  You'll never get me.  Good to know. 
[02:02:30]  Computer joke.  Yeah, there's a little loophole there.  Pat in Buffalo, what's up?  Hey, I just want Jimmy to be careful with Kristen Bell  because Kate Beckinsale is a little jealous after their stunning relationship.  Oh, yeah, she was so impressed.  Yeah, Jimmy, why don't you remind the listeners?  And why don't you tell Kristen here for the first time?  About Kate Beckinsale and your chemistry you had with her.  A little actress by the name of Kate Beckinsale.  It was, you know, it was like a whirlwind type thing.  Whirlwind, all right.  I did Leno with Kate. 
[02:03:00]  Jay Leno, by the way.  Just in case Leno, you know, the way he spits it out.  I did Leno.  She was the lead guest, and I was the second guest.  And she stayed on the couch.  So I do my, I do stand up.  I do my set, and I walk over.  And I sit down.  I say hi to Jay.  Kate and I address each other.  And we talked during the break.  And she's really funny.  She's still talking about a potty mouth, but a filthy mouth she has.  I loved Kate Beckinsale. 
[02:03:30]  So we're talking, and we're walking over.  Like what you do at the tonight show is after the band is done,  you walk over there, and you all like stand in the frame together.  Yeah, yeah.  And she tripped, and we almost fell into each other.  And then she told me she wasn't wearing underwear,  which she was kind of kidding slash, yeah, believe me,  that's exactly what I thought.  There was no humor in it.  I just went awesome, like angry.  And she's like, at the end, we were talking,  and she's like, hey, I'm going to be in New York next week.  Are you performing anywhere?  So I told her, yeah, the comedy seller.  She's like, all right, well, give my number.  Give me your number to my assistant.  I would love to see you when I come. 
[02:04:00]  So lo and behold, a week or so later, my phone rings.  Hi.  When he tells us this, though, we are just like, oh, my God,  you're going out with Kate Beckinsale.  This is the biggest thing ever.  You know, it's our little Jimmy on this Hollywood date.  Well, they called me when they got into town.  They're like, look, Kate wants to come see you tonight.  Are you performing?  So I said, yes, I'm performing at the comedy.  So I got a call back a little bit later from the assistant saying, look,  she has to do press really early in the morning.  Can she come tomorrow night?  And I'm like, yeah, no problem.  And I immediately knew, A, she'd never come. 
[02:04:30]  She would be very busy.  And they talked about it on the show.  And everybody thought I was going to have a date with Kate Beckinsale.  But it kind of worked out the way it normally does,  where I was at the comedy show, and I kept kind of running to the door,  peeking.  Oh, how sad.  Is that the saddest thing?  You ever wait for a package from UPS,  and you just keep pushing your dumb Breathe Right strip fat face  against the screen door going, is that my package?  And life just keeps saying, no, fat face, it's not your package. 
[02:05:00]  No, it's never coming.  Hey, we've got to take a break.  We've really got to take a break, or we're really screwed today.  You want to stick around through a break, or you've got to go?  What do you got to do?  I've got Regis in a couple minutes.  Oh, no, why don't you get out of here?  That's very important.  We get out of here.  Well, we'd like you to stay.  That's his way of being charming.  He was actually, he wasn't saying leave.  I'd love to stay, but what time is it?  It is 20.  It is 20.  What time do you got to be at Regis?  Ooh, nine.  Yeah.  Yeah, why don't you go?  You've got to go.  We love you, though.  Kristen Bell, the new movie's Pulse.  It's out in theaters this Friday, I guess, right? 
[02:05:30]  And also Veronica Mars premiered October 3rd on the new CW Network.  It's Tuesdays at 9, so good luck with Pulse.  And the preview for Pulse looks really good, so we'll see what happens.  Thanks.  All right, it's Kristen Bell, everyone.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:06:00]  I'll bring us back if you want.  Hey, you were listening before, and then we had some commercials, so apparently you're back with us here on the show.  Welcome, and appreciate it a lot.  Thanks.  Wow, I thought we were listening to a professional music jock bringing back the show.  This is the Opie and Anthony radio program, and it's also called The Virus by a lot of folks, because viruses spread. 
[02:06:30]  We do, too, across America.  But then again, it's in Canada, too, if you're looking at XM, because we're all over the country, and XM is in Canada.  Wow, this is a good bring back.  I'm bringing everybody back.  Good work.  That's right.  Job well done.  So I appreciate your listenership.  All right.  All right.  And thank you, Kristen Bell.  By the way, she's going to be on Regis today.  She is so fantastic looking.  You want to see her watch Regis.  She's so little. 
[02:07:00]  Anthony and I were talking.  Isn't she tiny?  She was playing with her skirt on the couch.  Oh, I couldn't look.  At one point, she went to sit Indian style on the couch, so she pulled her skirt up, and  yeah, we got a little view.  Oh, I'm so jealous.  Yeah.  What did you see?  What did you see?  I saw, like, whitish thong.  You saw London?  You saw France?  I saw your underpants. 
[02:07:30]  Underpants.  I know that one.  Kristen's underpants.  But it was like a quick flash as she brought her legs up, because she pulled, really, like,  pulled her skirt up high to get her knees crossed.  Pretty much.  Hello, boys.  Yeah, it was like, hi.  And I'm looking right at her, so I couldn't, I couldn't avert my eyes.  She just, here's what she does.  She's, like, you're like that beautiful, just wrecks you, like, ruins you.  Yeah, man, like, you're just like, ugh.  She could literally, if we went on a date, and we ate something, and at the end of dinner, 
[02:08:00]  she spit on me, I would still pick up the phone if she called me again.  Of course.  That's how fantastic she is.  She could throw up on you.  Well, Foxtrot Yankee.  And you'd be fine with it.  From Washington, D.C., if you thought she was hot, you should see her when they dress  her up in little high school outfits on Veronica Mars.  Yeah, she's 26.  I can't believe it.  Is that what they do?  It's the best show on TV.  Yeah, she plays, she plays young very well, you could see.  God, she's great.  I feel like Carson interviewing a kid.  She's just wonderful. 
[02:08:30]  All right, we gotta.  I feel like a little chemistry between us.  Oh.  We've been playing catch-up all morning.  We're pretty much, we pretty much have to go.  We just broke.  We thought we could do a few minutes, but now we have to go again.  Somewhere along the line, we lost.  What happened?  We lost the battle today?  We lost against time.  Yeah.  Time always wins, my friend.  Remember me and you were discussing that once?  Time beat us.  In the shower nude?  That's right.  Got it on video.  I'm starting to think that might not have been a good idea, that skit.  Yeah, it's not going to go around anyway. 
[02:09:00]  Oh my God.  I don't see anybody downloading it.  It's been downloaded a lot already.  It's on YouTube.  It's on opianthony.com.  It's on foundrymusic.com.  The fan sites have it.  They're commenting on it.  It's my first nude scene, and I'm sure.  Well, it's not a complete nude scene.  That's my nude scene.  That's it.  That's it.  That's as nude as you get.  Yeah, you got to, you know, when you're an actor, Anthony, you have to have a line that  you won't cross.  For me, nude scenes, I'll go down to my tighty-whities. 
[02:09:30]  That's it?  Although they were Calvin Klein's and like kind of a charcoal gray.  They had a nice hue against the pinkish beauty of your skin.  Like there was a contrast between the charcoal gray underpants and the soft, if I may, the  baby textured skin that you have.  It was like a wonderful contrast.  Jimmy, on the other hand, has no boundaries.  He will be completely nude.  I do, actually.  For me to do frontal nudity, it has to, A, I cannot have a cowering radio host in the  corner and B, the room has to be a certain. 
[02:10:00]  I saw your frontal nudity.  No, no, you didn't.  You saw.  You look like an adult baby.  There's no, there's no shrubbery.  I have no hair.  He's talked about this on the air about having no shrubbery.  Right.  And I saw it for myself and he ain't lying.  He has no shrubbery.  Not even a hint.  Sometimes you put just a little bush.  Nope.  All in all.  However, I will say, I mean, for me to do frontal nudity, if a friend sees you, who cares?  For me to have the camera see it, you cannot be in there and it has to, it has to be a 
[02:10:30]  certain temperature.  Clothes set.  Warm.  And it's got to be warm, yes.  Yeah, you should have seen Cole poking his head in there.  Everyone went, Keith the cop, everyone wanted a peek.  Everybody wanted a peek.  You think, I don't know, poking our little heads in, trying to catch a glimpse.  This video where I'm almost naked and Jimmy's completely naked, it's all the rage today.  Go to opianthony.com.  We're going to get a better copy of that because it's still clipping.  By the way, okay.  And we're going to also hopefully get the outtake where I just start laughing uncontrollably  because I see what Jimmy was packing and how he presents his area to the ladies out there. 
[02:11:00]  We're on in San Francisco now.  And look, not to be stereotypical, but there's a lot of gay people in San Francisco.  It's just a fact.  Right.  You men in San Francisco, you love other men.  Well, wait till you get a load of my hiney.  We are about to shoot to number one in San Francisco, my friends.  But they're debating on the fan sites what's going on with your hiney because there's like  there's a, see, you can't really say it. 
[02:11:30]  We'll say it over at XM.  Trust me, I'll explain that at XM today.  That's all it is.  It's a shadow.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to say it's a shadow.  All right.  Other people are saying it might be something else.  That's all I'm saying.  I think they can figure it out.  Oh, don't be a goose.  All right.  Well, that video is up on opianthony.com, getting downloaded like crazy.  I don't even know.  I understand.  We have to leave.  This sucks.  All right.  We have more stories from the ONA traveling virus tomorrow on this side of the show.  We got lots to do on the other side of the show today.  I hear some people are downstairs to welcome us back into New York because we've been away 
[02:12:00]  for a few days.  We're off to XM satellite radio.  Yeah.  If you're not joining us, thank you so much.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  We at the Opie and Anthony, y'all, appreciate that not everyone has access to a professional  recording studio.  So when listeners send us their own material, we know it might sound slightly less polished. 
[02:12:30]  Opie and Anthony, hardcore radio.  Oh, my smoothies are here.  I want a smoothie, but I want pineapple, strawberry.  I like blueberry.  I like soft fruit.  Were you in a beauty parlor two weeks ago?  What do you need, dolphins?  Do you like looking at me?  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Spread the virus. 
[02:13:00]  I got my back wax gesture.  What the hell is wrong with you?  If you think you have the chance to be a bargain bin broadcaster, send in your material.  And keep in mind the very likely possibility that you just might suck.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  XM to the kill.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Oh, my God. 
[02:13:30]  That's right.  Look how lovely.  What you're listening to is the sound.  That's the sound of Danny's liver since he stopped drinking.  That stupid sideways hat he has.  I want to spit my gum in his hair.  They decided to welcome us home.  Yes.  From our Boston road trip.  Isn't that wonderful?  It made us a little smile.  Look at that.  Pelt talks on us.  That's nice. 
[02:14:00]  And Opie called it right.  Opie said there's going to be some people.  Maybe they'll welcome us back when we get back.  And I'm like, no, there'll be two people outside.  So you were correct.  No.  That's wonderful.  No, you said there'd be people.  Yeah, you guys did all right.  A nice showing out here today.  I see our construction workers back.  Are you back to work with the hard hat?  Yeah, come on over here.  We got an update on the guy that fell.  What, 14 feet was it?  You can come on over here.  Anytime you want to limp over here.  He looks like Gandolfini in True Romance.  That or Fred Flintstone I was told, too.  Really?  I wouldn't insult you.  Thanks. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  Thanks for the update.  All right.  Let's walk.  Jesus.  Do you know when to talk?  Don't be shy.  So what happened?  Are you on Vicodin?  Yeah.  He's all smiling.  Oh, that's it.  He's re-breaking the arm and laughing.  That's why you look so pretty, Dalton.  You might want to drop a few out of your pocket as we walk.  What do you have in your pocket, sir?  Oh, pills.  He's wearing a hard hat.  All right.  That was a great update.  He's got a cast, so I don't know.  We'll walk.  He's a good boy.  We got pal talk out here.  Oh, yeah.  Happy typing girls here. 
[02:15:00]  Lots of video.  All the regulars.  The irregular regulars.  Oh, stop with the language.  Morning.  Hey, nice.  The relief from the heat, huh?  Right?  Am I right or wrong?  Hey, Henry Fondon on Golden Pond.  Hey.  I was picking blueberries.  I heard the loons.  Did you?  Did you?  That was the Grim Reaper going, psst.  Yeah, that fishing hat was awful.  Look at that.  Look at this hairdo.  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  That blonde lady had cryptkeeper hair.  Hey, look at Bob Kelly.  Watch your back.  Hi, sir.  Oh, he's got a bunch of CDs for you.  I don't know what those are.  What do you got for Jimmy?  I got all of his, um.  Stop, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ah, Jimmy's making deals on the street.  It's like a drug deal just went through.  No, this Dirty Ralph, his name is, on Paltalk.  And, uh, thank you, Kenny.  Yeah.  This guy, I love this guy.  He gives me, like, Sabbath CDs and DVDs.  Oh, he's got the greatest collection. 
[02:16:00]  Thanks a lot, man.  Very nice.  That's great.  Very nice.  Hey, how about it?  Nice relief from the heat, right?  Nice relief from the heat.  She's hiding from you.  She's hiding behind a bus sign.  She's trying to read.  People are horrified just from questions.  Hi, lovely lady.  Relief from the heat?  Good.  All right, good for you.  No one ever wants to talk to us.  Nobody does.  Why?  We're nice.  They just keep walking.  We smile.  We ask, like, not bad questions.  Hi, girls.  Hello.  Nice relief from the heat. 
[02:16:30]  Right now, you can sit outside and not bake.  Ha, ha.  You think you're pretty.  She doesn't care.  They still smell like fish.  Why?  What did Kenny say?  Kenny, what was that?  They still smell like fish.  Ha, ha, ha.  It's like my father used to say.  It smells like fish, a tasty dish.  It smells like cologne.  Leave it alone.  I said, good point, Dad.  And then he put fish on his dick and said, now suck.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I like that. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  And, uh...  How you doing?  Lumbering along.  All right.  Nice comb over.  Wow.  That was a good one.  Started from your ear.  That's always attractive.  There we go.  There we go.  There we go.  Oh, that's getting a reaction for the walkers today.  As he plows into some pedestrians.  Oh, God.  That would have been the greatest.  All I want in life is for one fan to beep and look at us and hit somebody.  That's all I want.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  Not kill him.  Just hit him a little bit.  I'm starting to think we might have lost our homeless friend for good. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's not around anymore.  I probably had his legs hacked off.  All right.  Well, he wasn't feeling too good the last time we talked to him.  And he shouldn't have been.  Nah.  Nah.  Not at all.  That got a good reaction at the ONA Traveling Virus when they showed his leg.  Oh, yeah.  It was disgusting.  One of those video clips had the homeless dude rolling up his pants leg.  I saw the videos.  Yeah.  Honestly, Jimmy, I'm with you.  I don't know what the hell was going on with that.  There's not much representation of little Jimmy Norton. 
[02:18:00]  No, I know.  Why would there be?  Well, why would there be?  That's going to change for the next show at the PNC.  I'm very angered.  Just leave it.  No.  Fuck it.  Whatever.  Go tussle that kid's head.  You might need a bra, lady.  You might need a bra.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Want to sign your one-night stand DVD for Al?  Yeah, of course, man.  Jimmy's signing autographs.  Hi, Al.  Thanks for supporting me.  We're almost there.  Wow.  I don't know where to get this.  People keep asking me where to get this.  I know you can get it on Amazon.com. 
[02:18:30]  Wow, big crowd around Jimmy.  He's signing the, I guess, his DVD.  Oh, you sure can.  Oh, Traveling Virus shirts.  Look at the awful body.  Come here, you guys.  I'm from Massachusetts.  What's interesting?  Thanks, bro.  Look at the awful body on this woman from behind.  Can I get a picture with you?  Yeah, he got my brother's shirt on.  Look with her ankles.  Holy shit.  By the way, you can get the Opian Anthony Traveling Virus t-shirt at MyRadioStore.com.  Get that.  What the fuck is that? 
[02:19:00]  You got it?  What the fuck is that?  No worries.  Thank you.  Thanks for listening.  How are you?  Don't be shy.  What's your name?  Oh, a picture?  Well, of course.  I would love to.  Come on in here, sir.  I'll just look high.  Smile.  You get that?  Very good.  All right.  Very good.  Are we going to go inside?  I mean, these guys came out.  I feel like we should dance for them.  Oh, I'm signing a hat.  Or juggle.  I don't know.  What should we do? 
[02:19:30]  Hey, did the kids cry when they got tattoos?  It's got to hurt, right?  Tender skin.  Did the needle hurt?  Oh, it comes off?  He won't talk at all.  No, huh?  Look at you pushing.  Pushing his kids into the mic.  They're shy, quiet.  They're adorable.  Don't be shy.  He's either nervous or that's really weird.  They are yours, right?  Or that's a really weird.  You didn't just pick them up?  Times Square?  That's what me and Jimmy do.  I was shy when I was that young.  Were you? 
[02:20:00]  I would never talk.  Then what happened?  You were sexually active when you were that young.  I know I was, but I was shy, too.  All right.  Not by his own means.  Or wants.  You missed a great observation because no one was listening to me.  Forget it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Forget it.  What was it?  I missed it.  I know.  I was two inches away trying to tell you.  Oh, tell me.  We can't hear sometimes.  Iron Maiden's got a new, what?  What do they got out there?  They're advertising something there.  Matter of life and death.  World tour.  06.  It's where Bruce Dickinson just insults Sabbath again.  That douche.  You don't like the Bruce Dickinson?  As his stuff, musically, I love them. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, what happened?  That guy's hair.  Bernie Getz.  I just, we see him every day.  What's that hair do?  Get a haircut.  Oh.  The toupee isn't working, sir.  We all can see.  Oh, boy.  That guy.  We all can see.  Had the worst hair piece.  All right.  It looked like, it was, it looked like a hay hat.  So what's the deal with Bruce Dickinson?  He just, he insulted Sabbath.  It was that whole thing back and forth.  And, uh, you know, on stage.  And that's when they threw stuff at him, like Sharon and those guys, apparently. 
[02:21:00]  Wow, look at the brawless Asian.  Very lovely.  Oh, gee.  Oh, no, she's wearing a braw, and the nips are still poking through.  I like that.  Well, yeah.  Like she's ducking down.  I like nipples.  Hey, uh, speaking of music, the big story today.  Jimmy?  Yes.  Kiss, still not inducted into the Hall of Fame, and they're making a big deal out of it.  I will say this.  I love Kiss.  Should they be in the Hall of Fame?  I mean, I don't know.  I'm biased towards Sabbath, but I think musically, Sabbath influenced.  But then again, Kiss did influence a lot of, I think, the 80s metal. 
[02:21:30]  But Sabbath, musically, really influenced a lot of people.  I would like to see a list of the bands that made it in, and then you could, it would be  obvious if Kiss belongs in there or not.  Of course they're going to throw Kiss into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Eventually, maybe.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame meets that controversy.  I don't know why.  It inducts everybody.  Right.  And after so many years go by, everyone gets in.  Well, then it picks a band that it ignores for a few years to get some talk going, controversy. 
[02:22:00]  Is this Pat from Menachie pulling up?  No.  Okay.  I saw the blue van.  I thought it might be Pat.  It's somebody else.  I don't have any real respect.  That guy looks healthy.  The Hall.  Anybody else?  Anyone have anything before we go inside?  So many people.  What do you got?  What do you got?  What do you want, sir?  Oh, autographs?  Oh, he wants us to sign stuff.  Oh, boy.  That might be a problem because we've got to do a radio show.  Yeah.  Is this someone here from Cincinnati or something?  Oh, is this Johnny Fever?  Thank you.  Hi.  Oh, hey, guys.  How are you? 
[02:22:30]  How do you know that?  Jason and Anthony.  They're friends of mine.  Yeah.  I didn't bring my fudgesicles.  Oh, no.  Is there a story there, Jimmy?  Is there a backstory here?  Yes.  Here's the story.  Yeah.  I want to bang her.  Her boyfriend's 6'3".  End of story.  No, they're just friends of mine from Pal Talk.  They're always on.  They're big fans of the show.  We met once.  They all came to the show.  Any Pal Talk action?  You guys do things on Pal Talk or just sit there and talk?  No.  You make it sound like no one's ever fucked on Pal Talk. 
[02:23:00]  That was an awful question.  Jesus, but no.  No.  I hold religious sermons.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  My goal is to fuck on Pal Talk.  Is it?  Eric.  My goal is to fuck Eric in his little bottom on Pal Talk.  Thank you.  While Danny uses his back as a fucking table to hold drinks on.  Where's that liquid-up idiot?  Right there.  Where is that?  Oh, there he is.  Duh.  Your hat's on, Crooked.  Atta boy.  And so is your liver. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Anyone else?  Anything?  Because we've got to go upstairs.  We want to thank you guys for walking with us today.  And welcome us.  Welcome.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Maybe we'll give tours today.  Can we get that to happen?  Well, I promised some people from Florida I would let them in.  How about they, like, have a line out here and you bring them up two at a time to look  at us like we're in the zoo and then get them out of there?  All right.  I'll charge admission.  This is a very rare thing. 
[02:24:00]  We don't do tours because they don't allow us to.  But today, can we make it happen?  Please line up single file size order down the sidewalk.  The studio won't allow it.  And if you want to give a donation for Danny's alcoholism, it would be greatly appreciated.  He'll drink it.  Tours on the Opie and Anthony show today.  That's right.  $50.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony XM202.  Messicans.  That sucks.  Lesbians.  I like that in a woman.  Read every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex. 
[02:24:30]  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The oncloth of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's pedophile humor.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here are cops.  Here are cops.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[02:25:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:26:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:26:30]  What was the first one in? 
[02:27:00]  I have an iron bladder.  No one else goes running to the bathroom to take a pit.  Can't you wait one goddamn break?  That was a nice crowd downstairs.  Apparently, they're coming up for a tour.  Two at a time.  Going to bring them up.  File them past the window.  They could look in like we're fish.  And then out they go.  Kick their ass out.  Who brought that up?  Was that your plan? 
[02:27:30]  What?  The tour?  Yeah.  I thought it was Jimmy's.  Because it's perfect for him.  It's like a perfect thing Jimmy would do to try to just get some of the weaker animals  away from the herd.  That's how Jimmy works.  What's that?  I thought the tour was your idea to get some of the like sick and weak antelope away from  the herd so you could pounce.  Not at all.  You said you were giving tours.  And they are actually a friend of mine from Cincinnati.  I knew them from Pal Talk. 
[02:28:00]  And a bunch of them came on a road trip to the Chicago show.  How did you get to know them on Pal Talk?  Chatting.  Chatting.  But you were obviously, you obviously thought you could get something going on.  Why don't you chat with a couple on Pal Talk?  Because they were nice.  I talked to a lot of people on Pal Talk that I'm not going to bang.  I mean, because they're from all over the country.  I like Pal Talk.  It's like when you're in the room and everybody's bullshitting and talking, you don't think  like, all right, I'm going to fuck this girl from Cincinnati.  It's just not realistic.  Was she wearing what she's wearing today?  Because that's a reason to talk to her.  She's got the low cut thing on.  Yeah.  You probably saw that on Pal Talk and went, eh, it's worth a shot. 
[02:28:30]  Of course.  I'm more likely to, but I knew she had a boyfriend immediately.  It wasn't like anything, no miscommunication.  When did you make believe you were just saying hi to them during the Pal Talk conversation?  You mean when I was not trying to get anything?  Yeah.  Probably like.  Because everything with you starts with, let's see what's going on here.  Probably a minute into it when he walked into frame.  And I'm like, who the fuck is that six foot three monster?  And then you're just covering yourself.  Like, no, no.  No, I'm just saying.  I'm just saying. 
[02:29:00]  I'm good.  Isn't it weird they've kind of set up stadium seating out there to watch?  There's a couch and then chairs behind it.  It's all staggered like a movie theater.  Well, I felt like we should do something today because they went out of their way to welcome  us back to New York.  That's true.  And we're a tired show today, so it was kind of nice to see.  Very nice.  Where's Club Soda Kenny?  How's the tours going to work?  How many minutes do they get?  I'm going to, let's just wing it. 
[02:29:30]  I'll give them, you know.  Well, how many people are outside?  There's like 20 more.  We wing you.  Okay.  You know, but I got to tend to your needs first.  You certainly do.  You guys take precedence.  Always top priority.  All right, so they're going to sit there.  Are you taking my DVDs, Kenny?  No, no.  Stop stealing my Sabbath stuff.  Oh, give me the John Valby stuff.  Oh, Valby.  We saw Valby.  I love him.  On Friday night.  At the Comedy Connection in Faneuil Hall.  And he was terrific. 
[02:30:00]  That fucker makes me laugh.  John Valby really makes me laugh, man.  He's potty mouth and he plays a hell of a piano.  And by the way, I got to ask the listeners for something.  I thought we were going to mention this before.  I forgot.  Anyone that has his old stuff, there's a song he did.  It's a serious song called Flying on one of his old cassette tapes.  I think it was off Dirt or Give Me Dirt or Give Me Dirt.  Oh, I know that one.  It goes, where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where?  Where's the fire?  No. 
[02:30:30]  It was a serious piano piece called Flying.  If anybody has it, please email it to me because I would love to hear it.  I'm sure now you'll get it.  I'm a big Valby fan.  All right.  Well, he did great.  And we're trying to get him for the ONA Traveling Virus for the Cleveland show.  How funny was he on the show, too?  He was hilarious on the show.  He was great on the radio show.  And then he was really, really good at the Comedy Connection.  And we want to get him when we do Cleveland.  When I was a kid, I would ride around.  I was like 14.  And someone gave me this Dr. Dirty tape. 
[02:31:00]  And it was Give Me Dirt or Give Me Death.  And it was some of the funniest shit I've ever heard.  And I used to pretend I was singing the songs.  I, you know.  And now I, what are you getting?  Oh, my God.  I want to know what this gift was from XM.  How funny is this?  Thank you, Don Wickman.  This is a little note he gives me.  Jimmy, this is what they sent from Breathe Right.  Told them you were a huge fan of their product.  I have been given a box of Breathe Right strips. 
[02:31:30]  And also...  Oh, look at this shirt.  I'm a stripper.  Oh, that shirt.  It says, I'm a stripper.  Please wear that tomorrow.  I'm a stripper.  You're goddamn right I'm going to wear it.  Yes.  So, thanks, Breathe Right.  I wish they would have sent me...  Oh, they did send me some of my favorite kind, which is the small, medium vapor strips.  That's the one I'm wearing now.  Do they give off, like, a little vapor?  Dude, you smell my nose.  No.  Why?  I don't...  I never smell a nose. 
[02:32:00]  It's, uh...  It's...  Yeah, they do have a vapor scent to them.  So, thank you guys for the Breathe Right.  I really do wear them.  And they have changed my life.  They certainly have.  No one can look at you now without going, what an idiot.  They never could before.  What do you think they thought when they saw me riding around the same prostitute block  40 times?  There's a decent boy.  There's a rocket scientist.  All right. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, Joe.  How many people...  This is the first time they've ever seen me play.  Tell the truth here.  Oh, you got a lot of new hits.  Let's start with this only.  Ain't no pussy when she's gone.  It's my hand when she's away.  And when my dick don't get no service, my dog gets really nervous. 
[02:33:00]  Ain't no pussy when she's gone.  It's my dick.  It's my ass.  It's my ass.  Ain't no beer till she's back.  I wrap my dick in my Big Mac.  I shared my burger with my boss.  He said he loved the secret sauce.  I'm a jerk, a jerk, a jerk, a jerk, a jerk, a jerk, a jerk, a jerk. 
[02:33:30]  I can't leave a little thing alone.  There ain't no pussy when she's gone.  Hey, Nathaniel, I want to ask Stan to isolate something.  There's one thing Valby does that I love so much.  It's when he does the Eat Bite song.  Like when he goes, like, Eat Bite, fuck's up.  And he'll, like, in between verses, he'll go, oh, fine, Eat Bite. 
[02:34:00]  That's the gang, man.  But it's in the Eat Bite song.  Remember when we were laughing?  Because Stan thought I made that up.  And then you just see Valby bellowing at the mic.  And then it goes up, like, half step.  And then it goes, ah, a little higher.  And by the way, I never knew this about our own gender bender, Stan.  A piano player.  You are?  He was admiring Valby's piano playing. 
[02:34:30]  I never knew that Stan, as Stan said, he tickled the ivories.  I heard this a while back.  Which ivories apparently mean balls.  I kept my mouth shut about it.  Are you really good?  Why?  That's great.  He's a virtuoso.  What?  Can we get a keyboard in here immediately?  Are you really good?  Yeah.  Do we have one?  Are you really good?  He goes, yeah.  Hold on.  Get out of the mic.  Get out of the mic.  You know, piano skills.  Most of the time when we discover someone's skills outside radio, they're like, yeah.  He's like, he's not denying it at all. 
[02:35:00]  How good were you?  Yeah, I'm obviously a little rusty.  But I started playing when I was like six.  How long?  Did you play until you were seven?  Or did it continue?  No, I still have a keyboard in my room.  What made you stop besides the piano teacher sitting you on his lap?  When did you realize it was really gay and you decide not to play anymore?  Piano isn't gay, is it?  I get mad.  I was in a rock and roll band playing the keyboards.  Ah, not the piano.  No.  I'm sure you were. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah?  What did you play in bands that, you know, like keyboard-oriented songs?  Like Doors.  Yeah.  Doors, stuff like that.  I know this won't go over well here, but lots of fish as well.  Fish.  Yeah.  Nice.  I like the fish.  You play any Elton?  No, we didn't break it down for Tiny Dancer.  He's a good piano player, right, Velby?  Yeah, he's awesome.  Yeah.  You see, he's a fucking, he's like, look, no offense, John, if you're listening, but you  make Danny look like a teetotaler.  That motherfucker does belt after belt, double shots.  Oh, yeah.  What a drinker. 
[02:36:00]  And yet he still plays and he's just, he never looks at the piano, which I guess is standard  among you fuckers.  I don't know how you do it.  Yeah, you don't have to actually look at the cane.  Dude, I can't get my dick inside of a girl without like opening it up and turning the lights  on and going, all right, helmet hole.  Helmet hole.  I know.  How do you get your fingers on those little thin keys?  How do you, we got to get a keyboard.  Do we have any on here?  None.  How do we not have a keyboard here?  I know.  I mean, we all know we sucked out the organ, but I mean, I had to do it.  And I have to crash it.  Okay, terrific. 
[02:36:30]  That one's loud.  It's always been loud.  That was too loud and hurtful.  Yes.  Well, can we get a keyboard for tomorrow somehow?  Yes, I want to hear a little.  Yeah, give me a little time to just warm up the chops a little bit.  You got 24 hours.  All right.  24 hours to get the rust out because we got to hear you play now.  I played for three years and I stopped.  No, you didn't.  I did when I was 11 or 14.  I played.  No, you didn't.  Okay.  You were too busy being a wigger.  That's what I was a little older.  So if this keyboard comes in here tomorrow, you'll be able to give us something?  Yeah.  Like the drums?  Yeah.  No. 
[02:37:00]  No, really?  Yeah.  Really?  What can you play?  He's such a liar.  Minimal thing.  I know.  He's lying.  He's cracking.  No.  But we have to get him to crack.  He'll look and he'll start going, la, la, la, la, la.  I will laugh.  And I'll laugh my ass off.  No, I'm actually laughing because I'm laughing, but I know that when you hear it, you're going  to eat your words.  Oh, okay.  How many keys are on a piano, Jimmy?  Bunch.  I didn't hear it, I guess. 
[02:37:30]  I don't know if ass is supposed to smell like shit, but I do know I'm full of ghoul.  And if you'd let me swear at all, not you, but a wonderful world yesterday. 
[02:38:00]  Don't know much about menstrual cramps.  Don't know much about those titty clamps.  Don't know much about K-Y gel.  Wish I did.  I tore her ass to hell.  But I do know I got 50 bucks.  And if that girl in the front table sucks.  I want to put her on this way.  One of my favorite old Valby songs. 
[02:38:30]  Does anybody remember At the End of the Month?  The song about the periods?  Oh, yeah.  The periods.  Oh, it's just vile.  Yeah.  He's a great man.  Is it on this?  I don't know.  Here, here.  Because it's not labeled that way, but...  Probably not.  It's a really...  Dude, he's got 25 CDs.  I don't know how much fucking material this guy goes for.  And you guys went, and just the crowd, a bunch of animals, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kenny got some underage drinkers kicked out that were having a really, really good time.  A killjoy.  Yeah.  Kenny, a killjoy. 
[02:39:00]  I felt bad for these guys.  They were really into it, and they couldn't have been more than 19, 20 years old.  They were annoying, though.  Which is amazing, because Valby's been doing this for well over 30 years.  You could point out annoying people at a Valby show.  The whole crowd is annoying.  There was a table right next to us, and they were all standing up, high-fiving and bumping  into the show.  Having fun.  They were just having a really good time.  Yeah.  And they were really drunk.  But here's the key.  They were being annoying.  Like, it was open lens.  It was thin.  I didn't mind them.  Maybe because I was sitting on the other side of the table, so I wasn't getting bumped 
[02:39:30]  into them.  And his gal.  And it was a bunch of...  Every time they jumped up, they would bump into our table, and they were hitting Lindsay,  they were hitting the table.  Oh, okay.  And it was...  It was like, I didn't want to be the old guy dick, but they were, like, stomping and  hitting the thing.  And it was really annoying, but I kept saying to myself...  You shook your chest at him and went, hey, you kids.  I just went, ha!  That's what all people say.  Fah!  He called the staff and went, hey, they're meddling!  Yeah.  You asked.  We're trying to have fun, and they're laughing. 
[02:40:00]  You're...  Why you?  I didn't want to be a dick, because they were having fun.  I'm like, these are guys that have been coming to see them for years.  Yeah.  But they were being so over-the-top annoying.  And Keith was...  The guy kept bumping into my chair.  Keith finally leaned over and said to the kid, hey, don't...  Every time you jump up, you're bumping into my guy.  Be careful.  And the guy was like, oh, I'm sorry.  He was cool about it.  So finally, the owners came over, the bosses of the connection, because they didn't want  it to get too crazy.  And they nicely asked the guys, hey, guys, at one point, fucking, the kid turned around 
[02:40:30]  and started rapping with Lindsey.  Not trying to pick her up, but just trying to, like, hey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to  be so annoying, whatever, but he was being annoying.  Yeah.  And boy, I just saw a giant fucking galoot swoop between the two tables, and it was really  a pleasant talking to, he gave the young man.  Yeah.  What'd you say?  I felt bad for those guys.  I did up to a point.  They got a little life lesson, but, you know, you don't mess with the boss's lady.  All right.  Kenny basically told the kid, fucking, stop talking to my friends. 
[02:41:00]  And the kid turned around a little dejected, but they were being annoying.  Dejected, or was he even thinking about showing you that he was pissed off at you?  There was 10 of them, and you still could have, like, tied one hand behind my back.  Yeah.  They were just dumb college kids that were, like, very excited.  They've all been young and stupid, though.  They were just having a good time.  Yeah, they didn't know any better.  That was fine.  No one was, like, wanting to punch them.  But then when the bosses came over, they go, look, you keep bumping into these guys.  They were bumping into our table. 
[02:41:30]  So the guy from Magic Connection comes over, go, look, we're going to move you.  They weren't throwing the guys out.  Uh-huh.  They were just going to move them to a table where there was nobody else next to them  so they could have the time that they were looking to have.  And, um, fucking the guy that Kenny spoke to, just all of a sudden, tough guy,  goes, why don't you move them?  Oh, boy.  Okay, cocksucker.  And then they realized they were underage.  And they all got the boot.  The reason you guys got the boot, if any of you are listening,  is because your friend was a jerk-off when the manager said,  I'm going to move you to a table where there's nobody next to you. 
[02:42:00]  Why don't you move them?  Because you're not bumping into them.  Right, we weren't causing them a problem.  And they were underage drinking with their own booze.  Yeah, they had booze in a water bottle that they were passing around.  Oh, okay.  They brought their own stuff in and were getting away with a little something-something.  That's very smart.  We didn't want you thrown out.  You know, they have a good club there, and they got to take care of that.  Absolutely.  Don't fuck around with that.  Hey, how's the tour going?  It's not a tour much anymore.  There's a theater out there.  Yeah, it's standing room only at this point.  There's women and children out there.  The guy's a good parent, brought his little kids in. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I saw that.  It's not new today.  Isn't that nice?  Don't throw out my friends, though.  No, no.  It's all good.  They're nice people, I guess.  They're having fun out there.  Hey, Ralph.  They're all very nice people.  Just nod yes or no.  Are these all CDs?  Any DVDs?  When you get time.  We've got a lot of lovely listeners out there.  We certainly do.  Well, there's still a few more that are vying to get in. 
[02:43:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Like, how about, I want to know about old Robert Reed hair there in the light blue shirt.  Look at that fucking Robert out there.  Huh?  Yeah.  Well, you want to talk.  There's one retarded person out there.  You want to talk to them as well?  Don't say.  What?  I know who you mean.  Do I have to pick the retarded?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Mullet?  No, they all look kind of special to me.  Why? 
[02:43:30]  Why did I just do that?  Anyone want to volunteer to be the retarded?  Why?  You would think I would help myself once.  So, why don't you say hi to the guy in the light blue?  No?  Why did you signal?  Hello?  Hey.  What's up?  He signaled, though.  But he signaled like when you put your hand flat out and you're back and forth in front  of your throat like, cut, cut, cut.  Like, no, no, no, no, no.  Like, that was like the inside TV signal.  Yeah.  I tried.  Don't be so shy.  I failed.  Why are you shy?  I don't know.  All right.  A little shy.  All right. 
[02:44:00]  Are you mad?  No.  You don't like me?  Why don't you like me?  Are you getting in there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's coming.  Is that you, girl?  Did you get in there last night?  Yeah.  No.  No, not last night, actually.  No.  What did you do to her?  What was last night?  We got off the train about 9, 10, coming back from the Worcester.  Oh, a real one.  Great.  What's your story?  We're the hosts for Gendrya Weekend.  So, Jason and Andrea, who came all the way from Cincinnati, are staying with them.  Boy, we couldn't get a more interesting bunch of people out here. 
[02:44:30]  Wait, hold on, Kenny.  Back up a little bit.  You guys are staying with that fucking serial killer face?  Yes.  Holy shit.  They're brave.  They're brave in Cincinnati.  Did you wake up in the middle of the night and catch him jerking off into your shoes?  What is he doing?  I don't know.  Just go back to sleep.  We should play Short End of the Stick today.  You ever play Short End of the Stick?  Yes, with God, and I lost.  Oh, okay.  No, you sit, you know, and you watch people go by.  You watch couples go by, and it's like, who got the short end of the stick? 
[02:45:00]  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, it's called Short End of the Stick.  Like, you laugh and laugh uncomfortably in their faces and stuff as they walk by.  Have that guy's girl stand up.  Stand up.  Just give a quick stand.  For example, these two.  Okay.  Get up.  Give a little spin.  All right, who's got the short end of the stick?  He's holding a billy club.  Holy Jesus, yeah.  And she has perhaps a pretzel nugget.  Yeah.  She got the short end of the stick.  She completely got the short end.  No offense to you.  No disrespect. 
[02:45:30]  Anybody else?  Unless you're, like, an F-18 pilot that just won lotto.  No.  No?  Okay.  No.  What do you do?  I'm actually a manager for Best Buy.  Okay.  Wow.  Okay, so maybe you got a little discount on that.  You got the company discount on the television.  Exactly.  You can look at someone from free shit.  Do you live in, oh, you're from Boston?  No, from Florida.  Oh, cool.  Where?  Jacksonville.  Ooh.  Yeah.  All right.  And what does she do?  She works at another Best Buy.  How about she talks?  Yeah, how about letting her talk? 
[02:46:00]  How about letting the lady talk?  What do you do, Missy?  Hi.  I also work at Best Buy.  Best Buy.  Wow, do you combine your discounts?  That's wonderful.  What's your job there?  Supervisor, actually.  Oh, do you have a better job at Best Buy than he has at Best Buy?  He's your boss?  No, we work at different ones.  But you got pretty much the same job, or?  No, he's above me.  You're above?  What do you do, then?  The way it should be.  Then what is he?  What is his job there?  I'm an operations manager.  You're all middle fucking management.  Yeah.  That's what you are.  You both have bosses, right? 
[02:46:30]  You're not like your last name isn't Best or Buy.  No, neither.  Wait.  Is she hoping to trade up?  She better.  Oh, my God.  Oh, don't be that way.  You can't give up that.  Are you like the supervisor, like the electronics store, and the 40-year-old virgin when you have  fuck buddies?  No.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Don't make her uncomfortable.  She's trolling around for Circuit City, guys.  All right, Kenny.  Go talk to the retard.  All right.  So, um...  Yes. 
[02:47:00]  Best we say bye to them.  Oh, stop it.  All right.  Very nice.  Edited crash.  Retard from the...  Hold on.  Last evening, out by the pond, my fairy godmother went nuts with her wife.  She barked up the word, she was half in the bag.  Now the pumpkin's a sumo who dresses in drag.  Chim-chim-a-dee, chim-chim-a-dee, chim-chim-chir-ee.  I got the balls of a rhino, the dick of a flea. 
[02:47:30]  Chim-chim-a-dee, chim-chim-a-dee, chim-chim-chir-oo.  I can see by your face that she fucked you up, too.  Well, I may not have much, but it's enough to fuck you.  We gotta get him for Cleveland.  I fucking love John Velvet.  Is Pete working on that today?  I do not know him.  I hope so. 
[02:48:00]  People, Pete's not just getting in the office in a few minutes.  I'll follow up on it.  All right.  Oh.  Who's this sweet angel?  I'm Purse Warden from PalTalk.  Oh, okay.  That's well good to you.  What's up, man?  It's weird when you see people's screen names and you see them as people.  Yeah, they're not real people to me.  No, they're all just screen names.  They're little postage stamp-sized squares of friends that you can just click on the X and  they're not your friends.  They're gone.  Well, they're not postage-sized.  If they're men, they're postage-sized.  If they're women, their window's been dragged open a little bigger.  Oh, is that it? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  And ladies, get better cameras, please.  I'm sick of the shitty fuzzy things I'm trying to master.  Yeah, come on.  It's 2006.  Get some better cameras.  That's right.  I have a good camera, which I never hook up because I don't want people to see my face.  So, sugar ass.  Ooh.  That's it.  Ooh.  Some guy was getting on Opie a little bit for the video that has been put up on the website.  Why?  What happened?  It says, this is Just George from Denver.  Opie, you pussy, lose the panties.  I just didn't sense your commitment to the rape. 
[02:49:00]  But here's why that did work, actually.  I didn't want to look willing.  That shows like you're still fighting it.  You're still like hoping against hope.  Or maybe Jimmy has a fetish where he likes pulling them to the side.  I would pull them to the side like a pair of panties.  But here's the way it works in comedy.  You start and you build.  And that's why the underpants worked.  You see the pinkish skin and the charcoal, the beautiful contrast of his underpants and his skin. 
[02:49:30]  But then I'm naked.  You go boom, boom.  You build a little bit.  That's how comedy works.  That was a build, all right.  You can't have two climaxes.  You have to have...  I've got that one.  You understand?  That's the way it works.  Oh, what is that?  Do you want me to just...  I swear to God, this is the...  Don't swear to God.  We got our review in from the DCU show.  Excuse me.  I have not read this.  Anthony has not read this.  Jimmy has not read this.  Who is it from?  The paper?  It has been brought to my attention. 
[02:50:00]  I have no idea if it's a good or bad review.  I'm just going to read it.  Okay, read it.  Unless it says something bad about Norton than Ixnay on the review A.  This will be pure honesty right here.  Okay.  We're not going to hide this.  What paper?  The Worcester Telegram and Gazette.  No, not that one.  All right.  And a lovely picture of Anthony on stage, by the way.  Oh, is that what it is?  Opie and Anthony show plays hard on audience.  Uh-oh.  Comedy review.  Worcester.  The Opie and Anthony traveling virus comedy tour made its first stop Saturday night  and decided to have it be at the DCU center. 
[02:50:30]  Complete with a clown sitting in a drunk tank just outside the main entrance who mercilessly  made fun of people.  A dunk tank.  Danny was the clown in the drunk tank.  And a playpen, hay bales and all inside the lobby.  This was nothing short of a traveling virus.  The show was supposed to be a full house seating just north of 13,000 people, but lack of ticket  sales, only 5,000.  I heard about 6,000, whatever.  We could argue that.  But he says, only 5,000 had been sold just before Rich Voss came on stage, forced the 
[02:51:00]  show to become more intimate in some strange way and really, why not?  What?  In some strange way and really, why?  Why not?  Let me just correct him really there.  We actually didn't expect a full house.  Peter told me early on, he's like, we're set up for about 5,000 or 6,000 people.  Yeah, we set the stage for half the arena.  Once we found out, we couldn't get a tweeter, which would have made it easier.  But whatever.  We didn't sell it out.  We didn't sell it out.  It is Opie and Anthony.  We're talking about the half house show really, really worked. 
[02:51:30]  Ooh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I see what they're getting at here.  Outside of Dane Cook's tourgasm back in spring 2005, this marks the first time that a comedy  tour will be traveling like a rock band, hitting different cities with the same lineup.  Call it the Ozfest of comedy tours, minus the second stage.  Voss, who hosted the first half of the show, came on to start the festivities.  After a brief 10-minute set, he gave way to Roxbury native Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr,  Robert Kelly, Bob Saget, Ralphie May, Jim Norton, and Tracy Morgan. 
[02:52:00]  They all performed.  The first half of the show was tremendous, even though Voss, as host, was missing on all  cylinders.  I thought Voss did great.  He did do great.  The first half of the show was tremendous, even though Voss, as host, was missing on all  cylinders.  O'Neill, Burr, Saget, and Kelly, who wasn't even listed as a performer for the evening  on any of the Opie and Anthony websites, all killed.  Don't worry, in comedy, that's a good thing. 
[02:52:30]  Of the first half of the show, O'Neill, Kelly, and Saget, who closed the first half, received  the most reaction.  O'Neill seemed very comfortable on stage.  Kelly seemed right at home.  And really, why not?  He did grow up in Boston and has performed in front of crowds just as big while he was  on tourgasm.  And Saget, once he got past the fact that he played Danny Tanner on Full House, was a  riot.  After a 25-minute intermission came, the shock and awe that Opie and Anthony are known for.  In an attempt to poke fun at Andrew Dice Clay in the Hillman morning show, well, not really.  We just said all the way from Mantown.  That was the only jab we took of those guys. 
[02:53:00]  They're a top competitor in this market.  Anthony came out in a studded jacket, making light of Clay, calling himself Dice.  Well, just think of a word that rhymes with Clay.  He can't say gay?  He couldn't write gay in the paper?  Right.  Why couldn't he say gay?  Pretty much, you're not describing what it was.  Why couldn't he say gay?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Let's get him on the line, man.  Yeah, let's ask him.  All right, so Anthony came out in a studded jacket, making light of Clay, calling himself 
[02:53:30]  Dice.  Well, just think of a word that rhymes with Clay.  Oh, my God.  Just remember, they are shock jocks.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, keep that in mind.  In an attempt to make a mockery out of Greg Hill, host of the Hillman morning show, and  Clay, the skit was distasteful and anything but funny?  Well, I am insulted.  I don't think they got the joke.  No, he didn't get the joke.  He might have a relationship with the Hillman.  Sounds like there's a relationship with the Hillman and doesn't like anything about gay, 
[02:54:00]  maybe.  And we might have hit too close to home.  I have no idea.  Let's get him on the phone.  If you're not even writing the word gay in the fucking paper, I think there's an issue  with maybe somebody being gay.  Look, this is what I don't understand, okay?  We can tell you the parts of the show that sucked.  Andrew Dice gay, you know, Anthony doing that, that killed.  I could-  Look, you're getting a lot of nines for the people that came from Worcester today.  Look, I'm being honest with myself.  I know I could do it better.  I know I could do it better.  It was the first time I ever did that, like, live. 
[02:54:30]  I know I could do it better.  But you don't have to defend yourself.  You've gotten a great reaction.  I'm not defending myself.  I'm just saying, I know-  I'll tell you what sucked.  The ONA Village kind of sucked.  The Drunk Clown kind of sucked.  Our bit sucked.  Oh, we know that.  And we'll get into that maybe tomorrow, because we want a lot more people to listen to us when  we tell you that we sucked.  We don't want to hide behind half the audience today.  But our bits sucked, and we'll explain why.  We were put in a really bad position, and I had no problem saying our bits sucked. 
[02:55:00]  But to say that Andrew Dice gay sucked?  No, that's funny.  That's obviously, again-  It may have worked for them on paper in a production meeting, but the idea did not translate well.  What are you talking about?  Oh, you're going on?  It may have worked for them on paper in a pre-production meeting, but the idea did not translate well.  After the debacle-  After that debacle?  After that debacle, with Greg Opie Hughes and Anthony Cumia taking the reins as hosts came 
[02:55:30]  Ralphie May, Jimmy Norton, and, of course, Tracy Morgan.  Norton followed and blew the roof off.  He came out to a standing ovation and left the stage 25 minutes later to another standing ovation.  He should have headlined the show.  Well, we've got to make some adjustments is what I'm saying now.  This show's going to be even better at the piece.  And I will say this.  Let me throw in the asterisk here.  I was asked, did I want to go on last?  And I said no.  I think you need to go on last, Jimmy.  We'll have to figure it out. 
[02:56:00]  But you want them leaving on a way high note, and you gave them that way high note.  I'll tell you why, and this is my thinking on it, is that a lot of the people-  Don't forget, I was in Boston recently with Dave Attell.  I was in Philly recently, in the Abrogata with Dave Attell.  And I do have- I have some new material, but a lot of people have heard, like, if you went to one of those shows.  Some of you haven't heard, some of you have.  But to me, like, I didn't want to go up there and have people-  I mean, people are okay if they hear the same joke twice.  Nobody heckled her.  I mean, they were still great.  But I don't want to- I don't know. 
[02:56:30]  I want them to have something different to close with.  And, like, I'm going to tell you what's happened to the PNC.  Mencia's going on last.  You know what?  Mencia's a national headliner.  You believe you can follow anybody.  Mencia always goes, fine, it's going to be great.  All right.  Finally, Morgan followed Norton.  And what a mistake that was.  People were filling out- filing, excuse me.  People were filing out of the DCU Center five minutes into his 25-minute set.  They were also tired at that point.  They gave him over three hours of show.  Very hard to go on late.  And this affected all of us.  And this- everyone after Patrice, because I think he was on first at the end of the gig, 
[02:57:00]  is once subjects in drama get covered, it's okay.  But in comedy, man, once a subject gets hit, like, it's really tough to hit it again a  few minutes later, because there's something weird about that in humor, where, like, somebody  pointed out on the message board, and I was glad they did this, that Patrice, Tracy, and  myself all did jokes about a girl gagging on our cock.  We're all pigs.  I mean, I was lucky, because Patrice and I were separated by a bunch of people.  Yeah.  So it might have been a little bit more affected.  But then Tracy had to go on right after me and do it, and he's just going to do his 
[02:57:30]  act.  Right.  So it's like, that's what happens in comedy once in a while.  So you can't really fault Tracy for that.  You come off as the less believable one, because you're white.  Well, yeah.  And also, please, I got a bigger dick than Patrice, and I hope he's listening, and I  hope you debate it, because we could take our cocks out and sword fight.  And I'm not saying that in any type of a gay way at all.  No, homo.  Mine will be hard, and yours won't.  All right.  The review ends with, he, you know, speaking of Tracy Morgan, he admittedly was stiff after  all.  He was backstage for three and a half hours, waiting for all the other comics to finish 
[02:58:00]  before taking the stage.  By the time he finished, nearly half of the arena had emptied out.  So there you go.  That's the review from the ONA traveling virus in Worcester.  Well, I would like to, I'm kind of.  Overall, a great review.  You know who's going to be making an appearance then, I think, the next show?  Andrew Nice Clay.  Attaboy.  Why not?  Hey, when's a door, not a door? 
[02:58:30]  When?  When it's a jar.  Attaboy.  Oh, my God.  Attaboy.  Oh!  Andrew Nice Clay.  Yeah.  I thought we were going to have Ambien Dice Gay.  What is that?  Where I just fall asleep?  Yeah, and you're just groggy and...  A little groggy.  Slurring and...  And you can't give up on it.  I'll just tell nice jokes.  It was good.  No, because this guy here, he thought it was distasteful. 
[02:59:00]  So I'll just tell nice jokes.  Fuck you.  Tell a nice joke.  I like the Andrew Nice Clay.  I wish I could do it a bit more, but I don't know any nice jokes.  How about two Jews walking to a bar?  They were citizens who were thirsty.  Huh?  Hickory dickory, Doc.  Thank God we know the time.  We can help others.  So there you go. 
[02:59:30]  That's a good review, though.  Yeah.  I disagree with the Anthony part, though, because the Andrew Nice Gay got big laughs.  I think that person might have a little agenda as far as an alternative lifestyle thing,  and could perhaps have a relationship with Greg Hill, because that is a Worcester station.  Yes, it is.  He was obsessed that we made fun of Greg Hill.  Yeah, and that was like one throwaway line that was last minute thrown out there. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, I showed Anthony as Andrew Nice Gay, and I just said all the way from Mantown,  just because gay, Mantown.  That was it.  That was it.  Honestly, we could care less about the Hill Man.  It wasn't a thing at all.  It was more as a way to introduce the gayness of the whole fucking character.  That's it.  That's the only reference to the Hill Man show.  It's didn't get the joke guy.  Oh!  That's...  The Bell Be.  Ah!  Can we hear that again, please? 
[03:00:30]  Ah!  I love when he does that.  All right.  It's an eat bite.  Ah!  Ah!  And watch him do it from the side.  He's just bellowing up at the microphone.  Makes me like a fish looking for something.  I have not heard this.  Ah, that's funny.  We're pumping him up, man. 
[03:01:00]  He's got to do the Cleveland show, Pete.  We love him.  Is that the whole thing?  That whole line?  No, no, no.  There's a thousand down in trouble showing for grants.  But every kid he's had the pleasure to know.  He nearer but stops to say hello.  To our Kelly's home.  Michael Jackson's in the corner with a 12-year-old.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:01:30]  I fucking love him. 
[03:02:00]  The rankest songs ever. 
[03:02:30]  And he's a lot of this stuff.  And he gives credit to his co-written by his friend Ron, who is a fucking guy who works for him as a completely degeneration.  Ron, real most generous.  A psychopath.  Wow.  Ron is a silent part and writes just about everything, actually.  Always has been a very big part of LB's career.  And he helps sell stuff.  And they're just a great team, man.  What a creep.  Oh, he is a foul.  We're pumping him up because we want him for the Cleveland show.  Yeah.  That's an ending to the One Traveling virus, to have him come out if everyone's completely hammered and do a few shows. 
[03:03:00]  All I want is to hear flying.  All right.  We'll get flying for you.  No problem.  Please.  The listeners are that damn good.  I know they are.  You want to hear one about Iraq as we go to break?  As long as it's not offensive.  And I'd appreciate language, young man.  This is my home.  Let's go with this cut as we take a break.  John Valby, everyone.  I'm on Travis. 
[03:03:30]  Here we go.  It's beginning to what the lot likes of the world all around Iraq.  Our regimes have a lot of spinneries.  So now it's time to get something else to play.  It ain't for the lot like victory.  It's common any day. 
[03:04:00]  But the prettiest sight of all is when gas prices start to flow.  Three thousand perils who spurred bloody troops in perils of poisonous gas.  The Marines are killing the Fennie with precision guided blasts.  And France and Germany can kiss my fucking ass. 
[03:04:30]  It's beginning to look a lot like rubble around that bad camp town.  But the prettiest sight for me is when I got to see that statue hit.  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA! 
[03:05:00]  USA!  USA!  USA!  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  What's up?  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  What, what, what, what?  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Hey, what, what, what, what, what, what?  Hey, what the hell's going on here? 
[03:05:30]  Awful, awful, awful.  They're just, they're just awful.  Awful people.  All right, we're back.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:06:00]  How long was that break?  I don't know.  A couple of minutes?  Solve the world's oil problem.  Or at least ours.  Yes, we did.  I love how we just solved this country's oil problems.  To you, we're idiots, but to each other, we're problem solvers.  We're geniuses.  Problem solvers.  Problem solved.  All the oil we need.  I'll let you in on it one day.  Until then, you can all go fuck yourself.  The problem solvers.  I'm just going through my Blackberry.  I like my Blackberry.  Blackberry.  I have a Blackberry.  I don't have the type you have. 
[03:06:30]  I have a new Blackberry.  Elo writes, Howard's pathetic show is on replay again today.  Holy crap.  How did we get that deal?  What day is it?  Wait, it's Monday.  Oh, it's August.  Remember?  Oh, that's right.  He's taking off the month of August.  But the zombies will tell you, he's not taking the whole month off.  He's working eight days.  By the way, thank you, Elo, for that lovely text message, wishing us luck.  Wishing us?  Wishing us luck.  Yeah, he didn't wish it because that would be faggy and annoying.  He wished us luck at the traveling virus. 
[03:07:00]  I got a nice text from Elo.  That's nice.  How many bosses would wish the boys luck?  Well, one, Tom Chiasano, who called me personally, not a text, to wish me luck.  So that's what I got.  Well, I didn't get anything from Elo.  I didn't get anything from Elo.  I would not have any connection to any of the CBS people.  No?  So I deal with only Elo.  He's, as far as I'm concerned, my only boss.  This is cute.  It's such a divorced family with kids, and some of them like the other parents better than the other ones.  I acknowledge only Elo. 
[03:07:30]  Because they give a little more.  That's nice.  He's the only one.  All right.  Why don't we talk...  And I'm not just saying that sexually.  Oh, of course not.  Why don't we talk about the...  Is Paul making everyone fill out paperwork just because they're standing out?  They're sitting on a couch.  Why are they filling...  What are they filling out?  It was supposed to be a quick dumb thing.  Wait, wait, wait.  Stan's saying something.  I think it's because they talked.  Okay.  Because they talked?  Why does this carrot juice taste like shit?  Wow.  Because it's carrot juice.  No, carrot juice is yummy. 
[03:08:00]  Ugh.  You never saw a rabbit wearing glasses, did you?  Oh, traveling virus, August 26, motherfuckers.  We had a lot of people show up outside CBS to welcome us home.  Yes.  They walked to Xan.  We said, well, fuck, we'll throw him a bone.  Have him come up and check out the show from behind the glass.  And they're too busy, like, filling out paperwork to enjoy the show.  So what was the...  Do they need to?  So what...  Paul looks like he lost weight. 
[03:08:30]  I don't think they need to.  I say they don't need to.  It was supposed to be a quick, spontaneous thing.  Yeah, just come up.  Spontaneity.  Now they're filling out paperwork.  That's wonderful.  All right.  The girls who partied with Mel Gibson.  They were on the good TV show, Good Morning America.  Oh, they were?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Those whores that were on the cover?  Hey, whoa.  Yeah.  Ah, okay.  The two blondes?  Yeah, the bimbos that looked like they were saying something so profound.  You know, Mel once said that everyone would have their... 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Anyway.  AIDS?  You know what he said?  Everyone would have their fucking...  Their life drain away.  Why are you playing with your penis?  I'm not playing with it.  I'm actually holding in a circle my cock and balls.  It's completely soft.  Why are you doing that?  Why wouldn't you?  It feels great.  Yeah, but we're trying to broadcast.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  I'm not like I'm smacking against the mic going and yummy.  But you're distracting everyone else.  No one's distracted.  And are you distracted by that?  No.  Why would it be?  Who cares?  Jimmy's a cock?  I was just reading something. 
[03:09:30]  Why would it bother him?  Elmo doesn't care.  Ah, don't be shy.  He's moving away from you.  Yeah, he is.  Patrick Swayze.  Defending Mel Gibson, by the way.  Oh, is he?  Patrick Swayze.  Because people actually wonder what he thinks.  Yeah.  Said he's a wonderful human being.  Cool.  Glad Pat spoke up.  Looks like he's not anti-Semitic.  Looks like no one has been paying attention to Patrick Swayze lately.  They fucking crawled to the woodwork, don't they?  I have a little trivia question for you guys.  Who's older?  Mel Gibson, Patrick Swayze. 
[03:10:00]  Um, Patrick Swayze.  I don't know.  Who gives a fuck?  Because you wanted us to say...  Right, correct, Jimmy.  You wanted us to say Mel Gibson.  I know.  By how much?  Patrick by 14 years.  No.  Uh, Patrick by eight weeks.  I'd say five years.  Patrick by fucking two years.  Wow, you're going five years.  You're a little over.  Patrick by three years.  Three years.  I said that on my eighth guess.  Patrick by who?  Patrick by, uh...  Yeah.  What are you reading, man?  I'll kiss you.  Uh, Mike sends me little things.  59th Street Bridge, lower level closed due to two-car fire. 
[03:10:30]  He knows.  He knows how to help me out.  Tell Mike to put it out.  On my way out of the city.  All right, here's, uh, the girls that party with Mel Gibson.  They're all over.  They're all over TV today.  Of course they are.  Because they'd party with me just as fast as Mel.  Fast as Mel.  Fast as Mel.  Fast as Mel.  The first clip...  You've been breathing around Danny?  First clip, how did you approach Mel?  Huh?  Pussy first.  I let my cunt do the talking. 
[03:11:00]  You don't think Mel approached them?  It couldn't be.  He might not have to.  He's Mel.  I know.  He's Mel.  Could you tell he was at all tipsy?  I know we've heard...  Tipsy.  It all happened there.  That's an extract.  I know we've heard rumors.  And joining us, as we mentioned, in the morning exclusive, Kimberly Sack and Julie Smith.  They talked with Gibson extensively, and of course the picture's first published in InTouch Weekly.  Kimberly Sack?  Thanks for being here, both of you.  What?  Is that what they said?  Oh, that's a great name for a whore.  Hope it's S-A-C-H.  They talked with Gibson extensively, and of course the picture's first published in InTouch Weekly. 
[03:11:30]  Thanks for being here, both of you.  You were in Malibu or in L.A. on a vacation weekend, long weekend, and many people go there  hoping to at least see a celebrity.  Tell me how the night transpired.  When you saw him, how did you approach him?  Well, we just went up there to get some drinks and get some L.A. dinner.  And someone came up to us and said that he was at the bar, the back bar on the deck.  And we went up there to see if it in fact was him, and it was.  Busy bodies. 
[03:12:00]  And then I think at that point, I just said, let's go say hello to him.  So we did.  And he was very approachable.  He was very approachable.  Yeah, sure he was.  If it was any one of these motherfuckers that are watching us out this window, he'd call  the bouncers and security.  They'd be kicked out like Elmo was over the weekend.  Oh, you know.  Nothing.  No, it's kind of true.  Very approachable.  Well, look in the mirror.  Of course he is.  Look at your pretty eyes and stuff.  I'm sure he would have reacted the same way with a fatty. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  So we did.  And he was very approachable.  He was very approachable.  Very approachable.  And how did you approach?  You just said, hello, I'm a fan.  I have to meet you.  I don't know if I, I think I just said hello.  And he just responded back.  And it was kind of like from the end of the conversation.  You want me to suck your cock, I think is the quote.  Hi, Mel.  Would you like to come in my face by the toilet?  All right.  Of course he responded.  Yeah.  You didn't even finish hello when he was like, hey, want a drink? 
[03:13:00]  Drunk bros.  Want a drink?  Want a drink?  Want a drink?  Want a shot?  Want a shot?  Orange whip?  Orange whip?  Orange whip?  Exactly.  Three orange whips.  Approachable.  Very approachable.  And how did you approach?  You just said, hello, I'm a fan.  I have to meet you.  I don't know if I, I think I just said hello.  And he just responded back.  And it was just kind of like from there, the conversation just flew.  Congratulations.  You are hot.  That's what that is.  Now go home.  Could you tell he was at all tipsy?  I know we've heard reports he was mostly drinking water. 
[03:13:30]  I mean, you could tell that he, you know, was a bit tipsy, but not, you know, he was walking  straight and talking straight and, you know, didn't seem any more tipsy than anybody else.  And was he somewhat of a social butterfly?  I know he left you, talked to others, came back to you.  A fucking social butterfly?  Butterfly.  He's a fucking movie star.  Oh, dude.  Was he a social butterfly?  That's what you asked? 
[03:14:00]  Oh, was he the cock of the walk?  God damn rich cunt.  I get scared.  Wow.  That's a good fart there.  You smell?  I honestly cannot smell it.  I can't smell it at all.  Something wicked.  Wait, you know what it is?  My stomach hurts.  This way.  You smell that?  I can't smell it.  I swear to God.  Yeah, it's happening today, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  My stomach is bothering me because I have too much fruit.  Fruit makes my stomach antsy.  My stomach is antsy. 
[03:14:30]  Anty.  All right, can we go back to this clip?  Here we go.  Butterfly, I know he left you, talked to others, came back to you.  Definitely.  Yeah, he was definitely working the crowd.  Yeah.  But it was more of a very comfortable...  He was working the chicks.  Yeah.  He was trying to figure out how easy you were.  He was a social butterfly.  He was running around going,  Passion of the Christ.  Tee-hee-hee.  Hey, Tee-hee.  They whipped him and put a...  Tee-hee.  Jews are awful.  Tee-hee. 
[03:15:00]  Got the only Mel Gibson audio from the club.  Yeah.  That night.  Yeah.  A couple of very beautiful girls, you know that?  Who are you tonight?  Kid Cat Club?  You ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  Wow.  He is a social butterfly.  He certainly is.  You know, running around.  Oh, it was a big mess.  Tee-hee-hee.  Such a man in the ass tray.  Tee-hee-hee, because they own it.  Tee-hee-hee-hee. 
[03:15:30]  Fluttering around daintily.  Working the crowd.  But it was more of a very comfortable setting.  It was very quiet.  It was not a big crowd.  It was not a loud place.  There wasn't music.  It was kind of like we were right on the beach.  And it was just kind of a very casual atmosphere.  And everyone was relaxed.  There was couches and booths.  People were just, you know, enjoying themselves.  Wow.  She just described a Saturday night out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there was alcohol and tables for people to put their drinks on and chairs for them 
[03:16:00]  in case they didn't want to.  Fucking whore.  Get to the point.  Were you concerned for his safety?  Did he seem inebriated enough that you were concerned for his safety leaving the bar?  Insofar as, you know, California laws being so strict with drunk driving.  I mean, there were a group of people who are.  There are.  You know, in a way that there are laws against drunk driving, I think, yes.  They're trying to sound like experts.  I know.  Did the blonde whore say, insofar, I thought I heard, insofar. 
[03:16:30]  Insofar.  And if I did, I'm going to hunt her down and fuck her throat.  They were visiting California.  They didn't know anything about California.  Oh, but no, no, no.  Apparently, fucking Barry Sheck knows all about it, insofar as the statute stays.  No, no.  You would know.  I guess she's a good reader, you know, reading all the articles in the newspaper, and now  she's just reciting what she read.  She's apparently a lawyer who makes a lot of money.  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism.  This happens every time one of those dancers start poom-tanging around with those show-folk 
[03:17:00]  facts.  See?  He knows.  He certainly does, insofar, really.  Did he seem inebriated enough that you were concerned for his safety leaving the bar?  Insofar as, you know, California laws being so strict.  Wait, let me ask you.  This is how that should go when a woman says that.  Insofar.  She shouldn't be able to get it out.  She should go.  Insofar.  Insofar.  You grab her hair so forcefully it hurts her. 
[03:17:30]  You know, California laws being so strict with drunk driving.  Right.  I mean, there were a group of people who offered him a ride home.  Of course there were.  Really?  And you think that's the result of the California law?  Or was he that obviously tipsy?  Well, I mean, I'm sure it would just be cool to give Mel Gibson a ride home.  Mel Gibson's stupid.  Let's be honest.  Steve is an alcoholic.  If that fucking yammering bear was fucking bumbling around, hold off for a ride.  No one.  Not even me. 
[03:18:00]  Wouldn't care.  Go ahead.  Kill yourself when you're hybrid.  But no, I've just been drinking.  Even better at the O&H Halloween virus is everyone knows Danny was completely hammered.  Oh, that fucking lunch.  No one's offering him a ride anywhere.  No, I did.  Well, yeah.  Exactly.  That obviously tipsy.  It would just be cool to give Mel Gibson a ride home.  Okay.  And it would be cool also to buy him a cocktail, but you think he resisted those offers.  Well, he resisted our offer.  Because he might put something in it, stupid.  Well, this is what he said.  No. 
[03:18:30]  My health doesn't allow this.  God, these girls are on TV for this?  Victor, what are you doing?  They were in a dumb freaking bar with Mel Gibson.  That's this.  They don't know shit about the incident.  And when you woke up the next day and found, or days later, found out the headlines as they  were and what he had said, your reaction to that?  We found out during lunch.  Friday afternoon.  Or Friday.  What were you eating, cunt?  He had been arrested for and charged with the DUI. 
[03:19:00]  And at that point, we were just kind of shocked.  Very unfortunate.  I would be unfortunate to hear that about anyone.  This is the fucking biggest non-information piece of shit interview I've ever heard.  There is nothing these girls can offer to move the story along.  This makes my Zach Wild on the bus interview look like a fucking 60 minutes expose.  You fucking soul.  Was he drinking?  Well, yeah, he said hi to...  Shut up! 
[03:19:30]  Girls, what are you going to be doing now?  Me and Mech are going to wing on over London and jam with the stones.  Really?  Are you?  Holy shit, did he get nothing out of them.  Nothing.  I didn't hear that about anyone.  Hopefully I don't know.  And I guess just kind of disbelief.  And that was just kind of like, oh, wow.  And then as the story unveiled and some of the accounts came out from the arrest, that was very shocking.  And how did that change your perception of him? 
[03:20:00]  Or did it?  It didn't change my perception of him.  It actually seems...  It just didn't seem right.  He was in a very good mood, very outgoing, very friendly.  And to hear the accounts of the arrest, it just doesn't seem right.  It is right.  He was not belligerent.  Yes, he was.  He didn't seem out of line at all.  You're a dumb chick.  So it just kind of makes you wonder what happened in those ten minutes.  He got pulled over and he got belligerent.  Stupid cunt.  What do you think happened? 
[03:20:30]  You fucking...  Stop trying to get on Mel's good graces.  He doesn't remember you.  He could care less about you.  Yeah.  That's just...  You know how many times that happens to that guy?  The girls...  Oh, look.  Mel, I hear he's out at the bar at the back.  Let's go meet him.  Oh, well, this is the first time this has ever happened to me.  Hi, Mel.  Being Mel Gibson.  Oh.  That guy's dreamy.  Hope they liked being in the spotlight for a couple of minutes.  Exactly.  Beat it.  It was great.  I have to cut her hair off against her will, and we'll see.  Scram. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, take this.  In other news...  All right.  I'd like to have her help me load a piece of furniture in the back of a van.  Would you?  I have some movie I actually need done.  I'd like her to help me fucking move the seed out of the bottom of my bag into a throat and hair.  Thanks.  That's the help.  In other news...  Joseph Blum's life will never be the same.  He says he's going through the mental and physical anguish of getting his finger bitten off by his brother-in-law, Michael Tabor.  This after, he says, he witnessed Tabor physically abusing his sister on the corner of Villa Avenue and Crescent Place in Yonkers. 
[03:21:30]  He says they were arguing about their pending divorce and custody of their two children.  I see him smack her and then put his hand on her throat.  At that point, Joseph says he ran to her aid.  Grabbed my left hand, put my index finger in his mouth, and bit it off.  He would not let it go.  The only way out, he wouldn't let it go.  When he let it go, I saw my whole bone exposed.  I wrapped it in my shirt, and I just called an ambulance, and he had my finger in his mouth. 
[03:22:00]  And I'm telling him, give me my finger so I can please have my finger to give to the doctors.  He's like, you want your finger?  He threw it back in his mouth, went in his car, and he locked the doors.  Holy Jesus.  What a great story.  He hit the sister and bit the finger off the brother.  This guy's a wrecking ball to this family.  And then he wouldn't give the finger back.  He's like, give me the finger. 
[03:22:30]  Runs in, locks the door.  And then what did he do?  Take it out of his mouth and dangle it?  So what happened?  Did he get the finger?  What a maniac.  I say we just go home now.  I got to know if he got it back.  I'm getting so angry at this guy for biting the finger off.  Yeah.  The guy grabbed him by the mouth, I guess.  Excuse me.  We got to back up a second.  Oh, wow.  Brett in Florida.  Brett.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Welcome aboard, Brett.  Hey, bravo Sierra on you boys.  Why?  They both had mics in front of them. 
[03:23:00]  They are experts at everything.  Wow.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, boys.  All right.  He is right.  He is right.  Then he says Yonkers police arrived on the scene.  Cops came.  I told them, they said, where's your finger, chap?  I say, he's got my finger.  They saw him where he had the finger.  Instantly, they took the cops out and arrested him.  They said, you're under arrest.  He's had my finger in his mouth for like three minutes, chewing on it, whatever he was doing.  Joseph says he went to the hospital. 
[03:23:30]  The doctors at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx couldn't reattach his finger because it was a human bite.  He's born with 10 fingers, man.  I got nine and a half for doing what most people in the world would say was the right thing.  Now, Joseph has hired a lawyer and plans to strike this out.  In court.  I'm hoping he knows what it's like to visit a jail cell.  Stop whining.  I'm hoping that he all knows you can't go around biting people.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  If I was in that situation, I would have swallowed a finger right in front of him. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, my God.  Because it was a human bite?  Probably such a sloppy bite.  Wait a minute.  I want to know, is there some kind of fucking protocol I never heard of?  No, no, no.  If you get a human bite, if something bites your finger?  I think it was because he was gnawing at it.  Gnawing.  There's no way to reattach the thing.  It's sloppy.  It's not a clean cut.  Like, for instance, if you're a piece of machinery, and the tip of your finger went through the knuckle.  Like, you know, like a buzzsaw went through your finger and cut it off. 
[03:24:30]  It's different.  It's a very clean cut.  But a human finger, put your finger in your mouth.  What about a dado head?  What is that?  It's on a saw.  It's a type of saw blade.  Takes a big swath out of something.  I just wanted to see Jimmy look puzzled when I said it.  That's all.  I don't know what a dado head is.  Yeah, because only Jimmy was puzzled.  I don't know what dado means.  I learned it in Woodshop.  But I'm willing to learn.  Back in the old days.  I want to learn.  I want to learn new things.  You don't want to learn. 
[03:25:00]  He's got intelligence.  Settle down, Charles.  How great is that story?  Amazing.  And uncomfortable.  Yeah, that was really sad when he started going,  You're both born with nine fingers.  I mean, ten fingers.  He ate my finger, Charlie.  He took my finger, Charlie.  It's not like the guy was a pianist.  Like, our own fan here.  Didn't need all ten.  Oh, he just did the old piano player knuckle bend.  That's right, boys.  Maestro. 
[03:25:30]  I will be showing you my talent soon.  God will be the maestro.  Yeah, I would have swallowed it and make him, like, fish through my shit to try to find his stupid finger.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Idaho.  Jeff.  I was going to ask you if you'd play the clip on how to eat a watermelon that you talked about Friday.  Oh, God.  I told you guys to remind us.  You wait until the end of the show.  What the fuck?  All right.  How to eat a watermelon.  I just remembered.  Yeah, sure.  How to eat a watermelon.  You know what?  Thank you.  It just insults people. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, we're going to do this after the break.  All right.  We've got a big break coming up.  Then we're going to do this.  We're going to do this.  Am I right or wrong?  Maybe this as well.  But definitely we're going to do this.  Sam.  The Radio Con Queso Grande presents Senor Opie and I'm...  Dude, what happened?  It's the end of the show.  It'll knock you on your goddamn ex.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was.

[03:27:00]  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Wow.  I'm going to ruin that for people because they're enjoying it.  Do we know where this came from?  I don't know.  No clue.  I don't know.  What do I know?  I'm not on the end on any of it.  I just show up  I'm a regular Joe  Look it's stiff  We're getting Steve in here to tell us what this is all about 
[03:27:30]  I guess it's a video that's been out there for a while  Steve what's this about  How to eat a watermelon  Do you have the write up on you?  Because I was just about to look it up  Oh you were going to look it up  Hey nice to see you sober  Thank you  It's a rarity so pay close attention  Soak it in  We haven't heard your side of the  The old van store  Oh okay  We can do that  My brother's blaming you because you were speaking in code  He also blames you for getting shit faced 
[03:28:00]  And for being gay  Well I can't help that  I don't know about that  But  As we were entering the garage structure  You know how they have  Like there's a big plastic piece that has the clearance written on it  Uh huh  So  Darren we hit that  And the van  I remember the van either slowing down  Or coming to an actual full stop  And I remember you said  Oh no we're okay  Because we hadn't actually hit the ceiling yet  Conflicting stories  Conflicting stories 
[03:28:30]  First of all I didn't blame you so  You fell into the trap  All I heard was  Six eight  Six eight  Six eight  Because you were saying  That you fit perfectly underneath  The thing that said what the height was  No we definitely  We definitely hit that  We definitely hit that  Oh boy  Because it's deceiving  Because you know  That thing comes down  And you think that's where the clearance is  So then you know  You look  And you see that you still have some more height  Before the ceiling is there  So  He thought that he would be able to  Skate right in 
[03:29:00]  Even though we clipped that plastic piece  But we would avoid the ceiling  So that just  Didn't work out like that  Oh boy  I don't remember  Clipping that at all  I just remember us  Coming to a grinding  Halt  No you have to hit that  No no Danny  Yeah I thought that was weird  When you did  Then  He's driving  You're in there  Who was supposed to drive that day  Danny  When it did clip  Did you say  Hey wait a minute  We hit the thing that says what the height is  Or did you just go

[03:34:00]  If there's a 30 second video  Of this shithole  What's it going to do?  Where's it going to end up?  Your tube?  I don't  I don't  Yeah  What?  The excitement of us  Sitting here talking  The internet  That internet  It's just a fad  What are they protecting against?  What could possibly happen?  There probably is a company policy  I mean that's  There is a company policy  And I'm just following the rules  Policy sounds a lot like police  By the way  Just noticing  Alright  Just want you to notice that  Great  Okay so now 
[03:34:30]  Happy typing girl  Alright the 400 feet  Yes they load the van  Yeah  I want to get into a couple other things here  So they load the van  You want to sit?  You're looking for the club seven  You never know  That we went to for like 15 minutes  Because it sucked  And the guy at the door by the way  At club seven  Just a typical door guy  I know  Douchebag  Anthony walks in  The guy goes up  You might want to take your hat off  They're very strict about that  He didn't say you might  He goes  Take the hat off  We don't allow hats in here 
[03:35:00]  There's going to be problems  Yeah  And especially after  Because when I did Andrew Dice Gay  Remember that unfunny little sketch that I did?  Terrible  When I did that  I had a  I couldn't wear the hat  Because you know  Dice man doesn't wear the hat  So I went in the shower  I believe Danny was there  And Keith the cop  We were all in the shower together  And I wet my head down  And like slipped it back  Well you and Keith  Trying to sober him up  Like Martin Sheen  In Apocalypse Now  Very good 
[03:35:30]  So I had to slick my hair back  And when I was done  I just threw the hat on  So now if you want  You cannot get worse hat head  Than when you wet your hair  And then put the hat on top of it  Nope  So I was not fucking taking my hat off  In that club  And the guy said that  And we were like  Yeah sure  Yeah okay whatever dude  He was just a jerk off  And then Ope's girlfriend  Walks in  And the guy says  Stop for ID  Which is understandable  Because she looks at her  She could be 20 
[03:36:00]  She could be 21  But then Mike Hall  Goes no no no  It's okay  It's okay  I don't know if he knew  Mike was a cop  In fairness to the door guy  He goes  No I say what's okay  I'm a cop you idiot  So the guy was just a dick  Yeah  A very unwelcoming atmosphere  We are at 7  So if you want to waste your time  And go there  And fucking whatever  Go  I hated it  We were out in 10 minutes  If that  10 minutes  No they didn't get a bartender for us  No no  That's right yeah  Their VIP area stinks  It fucking stinks 
[03:36:30]  If there was a bartender or something  Or a waitress that came over  Ask for something  Or how about something with a tits and a tray  Something  That's all we wanted  Tits and a tray  All right  So that was a disaster  Shit hole  So  Fucking awful music  So  Which is a club  All right  Shut up  I want to see what was going on  So you guys are ready to drive the van  And Danny was supposed to drive the van right 
[03:37:00]  Right  Yeah  And what happened  Danny was supposed to be  Danny had a little show on Pal Talk right before that  So we knew he wasn't probably in the best of sorts  Oh boy  What shot what happened  Nah I was just showing my ass  His ass  But  Well so we went to drive  And Danny actually was the one who said it  He said  I really shouldn't be driving  Are either you guys sober  Can one of you guys drive  Hey nice  At least you said it  Yeah I said it before  He did right there  Yeah I know  Yeah well  They looked at me  And I'm not going to drive 
[03:37:30]  I don't want the responsibility  For the XM van  Very good  You should work for this show  Truth is  The same exact thing would have happened  If I had been driving  Yeah  I would obviously leave  Being a fan of the show forever  What I want to know  The line of questioning here  When  Allegedly  You hit  Now you have a different story than that  But allegedly  The van did hit  The guard  That shows the height  Well I couldn't see  What they could see  Because they were in the front  I was sitting on a box of shirts in the back 
[03:38:00]  So I would  If there was something to see  I didn't see it  But I never felt it  Or heard it  Did you hear or feel  That little  No  Because usually there is  A guard first  Right  That you'll hit  And it's hanging on chains  Right  And it lets you know  Whoa I'm not going to fit here  I don't know if it's because  What the roof was made from  Run up  From  Oh that's good  You stink  What is that music  Oh my lord  Was there music playing or no  No  Okay  No well actually  There was music playing  But it wasn't loud  Okay  And you were in the back of the van  Yeah 
[03:38:30]  So you didn't hear  Where it would have hit up front  I was leaning in between the two seats  You know  And the person in the back  Is feeling stupid in the back  Right in the back all lonely  Right  Exactly  So you're kind of leaning forward  But you didn't hear  Any contact with the guard  I heard no contact  It was a total  When we hit  Like someone described  The iceberg  And the Titanic  Just a complete surprise  That's the first thing  That said anything was wrong  You just heard awful scraping  It was  Well  I also was thrown  Completely forward  It was  We came to a dead  I mean dead stop  Just 
[03:39:00]  We weren't going fast  We were going in the garage  But we just stopped  Wow  What was more jarring to your body  Flying forward after hitting something in a van  Or Steve coming through the door  And pushing him out of the way  The big bear that he is  It's pretty close  He doesn't know his own strength  He needs a muzzle  Just stay here  I'll take care of it  I'll run right over her  I'll barrel over her  How did your feet get bruised?  No it was just complete shock  Jesus Christ 
[03:39:30]  And how pissed off is Ziggy?  Well when I initially had called him  Right after it had happened  He thought I was just fucking with him  Because that's something I would probably do  Is just call him and say  Oh yeah by the way  Your van's wrecked  So he didn't even believe it  Until he called me back  About 20 minutes later  And he's like  That's terrible  I'm sorry  He's like  Dude  He's like  Are you fucking with me?  I'm like  No  This has happened  And he was kind of pissed  And then he realized  Screw it  It'll just be a story for the air tomorrow  So  No  Nothing's wrong  Just stay in the living room  I'll handle it  You're in my fucking studio 
[03:40:00]  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house  So Ziggy's alright?  I think he's a lot calmer than he was  Yeah  MyRadioStore.com  Absolutely  A lot of fantastic XM radios  And merchandise  And things of that ilk  Steve is video allowed  No no no no no no  Oh  Even just the phone  No no no no no no  They just got a cell phone  With a camera  No no no no no no  Alright  Will you make any intimidating sounds 
[03:40:30]  If you see one?  Oh  Grr  Whoa he's pissed  Grr  Put those phones away  Grr  Alright  Why not?  Oh now they can?  Why not?  So then you guys backed up?  If that's what you call it  Yeah we uh  I tried to extricate  Extricate  The van  Because what else can you do?  You can't keep going forward  Yeah you gotta back out  This is see my first experience  With this kind of  Accident 
[03:41:00]  Were you able  Incident  Now you're sitting in the driver's seat  Yeah  Were you able to look up  And see cement?  It was close to it  But no  It was shredded  Dan got out right away  And he was like  Holy shit  Trying to like  Figure out what to do  How we got  And suddenly he's sober  And up there like  Telling us where to go  I would have just  Ditched the van in the river  And said someone stole it  Well you should have fucking  Like put rocks  Through the windshield  And stuff  And then blamed it  On the opposing football team  Yeah  Disturbed feds  Decatur  Write some radio station logo 
[03:41:30]  On the side  And spray paint  That was an impression  Yeah what were you doing?  Danny  What was a Sean impression?  We actually have  I guess that was an impression  Of myself being drunk  Let's hear it  No I  Do it again  No I can't  I have to be in the moment  Just pretend you're  At any other time  When you're not at this show  That was a Sean impression  Yeah  Right on the money  It was good  It was wonderful  We have audio of Danny  Right after the accident  He looked at the damage  And here's what he said  Relax  Alright 
[03:42:00]  My old man  Is a television repairman  Got the ultimate set of tools  I can fix it  Well  Alright  Who's she?  Happy screening girl  Like a flesh  You know what he is?  He comes in like a pixie  Travis  Like a little pixie  Traipses in  Whispers  And leaves  Now when Danny realized 
[03:42:30]  He should have been driving the van  I got a little upset  I'm a fucking idiot  I'm a fucking idiot  I'm a fucking idiot  I'm a fucking idiot  Oh  It's so hard  Let's see  Yeah  A lot of people  Are a little shocked  Oh dear lord  Jesus  This ain't happening man  This can't be happening man  This ain't happening  That's it man 
[03:43:00]  Game over man  Game over  Poor Danny  Well that's great  This is fucking great man  Now what the fuck  Are we supposed to do?  We're some real pretty shit  Now man  Just walk away  Stupid  You're so stupid  You know what the saddest thing is  It could have all been prevented 
[03:43:30]  If they just would have  Looked under the seat  And saw it was sitting there  Hey you guys  Oh my no  Happy typing girl  Flies into the windshield  Hey you guys  Oh my no  Alright that's the end of that  I guess  No because no Brady thing  Could end  Without Robert Reed's ribs  Absolutely  Where are they?  Every time he coughs  Wait  Hold on 
[03:44:00]  He's gonna have a coughing fit  A little piece of phlegm  Going between his ribs  He just bounced off  Like a fucking  Like a pinball  He had AIDS  Asshole  Yeah  Alright let's go to the phone  Uh Kenny what's up?

[03:49:30]  That he was a small penis  Dude you want to take credit  For a big one  So why can't I  I didn't say I had a big one  No no no  Let me clarify here  No no no no no  I never said I had a big dick  I just said my dick  Is bigger than Patrice's  Yeah and I'm calling  To defend him  He didn't call in  There's no chance  No no no no no  No no no no no  No no no no no  So you wanted to call me out  And say that you think  His dick is bigger than mine  How about this  Yeah it is  You suck both of them  And then file a report  I love you anyhow  Take it easy

[03:51:00]  Right  I just can't understand how we as black people  Start eating watermelon in the closet  Lord have me  This is called a heart  You know  It makes me feel  So bad sometime when  I see black  My black brothers and sisters  And they'll see me eating a piece of watermelon like this  Yeah  And they'll go 
[03:51:30]  When they're going to frown their faces  That's despicable  But it's good  Okay  Wait do me a favor  Do you want us to do it in five minutes  Or do you want us to spend an hour on this  Oh boy  What is that from  We need a little time  What is that from  Where did that come from  And is there a video  Yeah where's  Who was explaining this  When all hell broke loose with the show  Was it meant to be a joke  Or is it serious  I think it's serious  Isn't that why  Danny came in originally  I think this guy really is 
[03:52:00]  Petey Green's  Let's see here  Oh the video  Look  We can tease this  The video's up on  OpianAnthony.com  Or FoundryMusic.com  In this clip from  Civil rights activist  Petey Green's  Washington D.C. television program  In the 70s  Green explains how to eat watermelon  Utterly bizarre  Also pointers on eating corn  And fried chicken  Ah  Well he certainly seems to be an expert  Yeah and now everyone's pounding the website 
[03:52:30]  So I don't think you're going to be able to see it  I want to see him eating woadie melon  Uh Danny  The guy's name is Petey Green  Petey Green  He was like a black power advocate  Down in Washington D.C. in the 70s  Are you reading my mind?  You said that already actually  I don't know  No no no it's cool  Why don't you come on in and repeat some more  Oh god  Now Danny's dead 
[03:53:00]  Danny's dead  He's really dead  Why?  He kind of looked at you like  Did he?  Well how about this  He should be sitting on fucking Beretta's shoulder  Going  Oh my god  It's just  We're a tired show today  Opie said that  And then Danny came in like  Folks sit down  It's Petey Green again  Yeah he's hiding now  Is he?  Yeah  I've never seen Danny mad in two years  The only thing he knows about Green 
[03:53:30]  Is it's the color of his face  After a bender  When he's fucking  When he's up chucking  Alright Deanna from California  Deanna  Hey  That last caller  The guy who called in to say  To talk about  The thing with Jim and Patrice's cock  Yeah  I don't know about the size of theirs  But for the most part  Normally little skinny guys  Have bigger ones  The size of your body  Doesn't have anything to do with it  Of course  Thank you  But I wouldn't know about being a little skinny guy either 
[03:54:00]  How about a mediocre  No no no  I'm not saying  I'm just saying little  Like a little guy  Alright  Like the most big guys are not  It doesn't have anything to do with that  Nothing  Your body size  You could be the littlest  So Deanna  Where do you do your cock talking?  What?  No I don't  It's not that  I mean just  I used to dance  And I'm  A what?  She used to dance  I used to dance  And don't talk all the time  And it doesn't have anything to do with that  Well how about this  I mean  Are you ever in New York?  To me  No no no no

Scott  Two cherses  Scott in New York  Scott  Hey guys 
[03:55:00]  Is the PNC show over 21, over 18  Or is it open?  I don't know  I don't know  Than would know  Than?  Please  Than comment  That's a crooked drop  Like the answer with a drop?  Wait we had one of these already  We don't know  Well I got to say that  Every venue may be different  Right  I'm going to think that it's 18 plus  Because most concerts are 
[03:55:30]  Maybe not even 18 plus  I have no idea  I wouldn't know  That info might be up on Ticketmaster.com's website  Or opnrg.com  Or on myspace.com slash Jim Norton  There's a lot of information and free tickets  But you have to sign up  Alright  Alright Scott  Thanks a lot guys  Thank you  Now tomorrow we'll have to get into the Lewis Twitchell Santani soap opera  Lewis Twitchell Santani  We wanted to get into that  Can we get him in?  We need reminders  How to eat a watermelon 
[03:56:00]  Why Twitchell's was crying  And balling  It had something to do with Kenny and Anthony saw him crying  Not just saw  Yeah  And then Patrick Minocchi  Had to drive Twitchell's back to New Jersey or whatever  So we were  We were talking about how uncomfortable that ride back to New Jersey must have been  Besides having no air conditioning  Shows are all ages  Okay shows are all ages  I told you  No one wants to listen to fucking Jim Norton  1A Charlie Cyrus 
[03:56:30]  What Jim?  All ages  Wasn't listening  Me neither  And what else?  Oh we got to talk about our bit from the first show  Oh  BCN you know  We love those guys  But they put us in a bad spot  Thank God  They put us in a bad position  Jesus  How could a contest where you have hot girls go on stage  Yeah  And then you have to decide who's the hottest girl  Yeah  Go wrong  How could that tank  In front of 5,000 to 6,000 people  How does that bit tank  Well we'll explain tomorrow 
[03:57:00]  When it's worked for a dozen years for us  We'll explain tomorrow  And they failed to mention a couple little things  About what we could and couldn't do on that stage  Exactly  Holy shit  So we'll get into that as well  And some other things  We're out of here for today I guess  Yup  Burr  I had a thought starter  Oh okay  For tomorrow?  No  But there's just been a lot of displaced indigenous people  And I wanted to talk about them  Alright 
[03:57:30]  You find a show to do that on?  I think that we tell a lot of jokes here  But the indigenous people of South America don't have homes  South America?  Yeah  Maybe we can have Norton Hour  You mean the ones that wear the funny looking derbies?  Norton, you want to do another hour?  Yeah  I'm going to be discussing  The plight of the indigenous  The indigenous  I like that word  The art of the  That's a good word  The art of the indigenous 
[03:58:00]  With Pat Barrington  The lovely vivacious Pat Barrington  I like to grab Pat Barrington's hair  And make her eat my ass until she suffocates  She would love it  No she wouldn't  She's all talk, no action  When I'm doing the erotic  It's more of a freestyle movement  Than when I'm doing the topless  That's more of a  What are you babbling about you friggin idiot  I don't think that was Pat Barrington  That wasn't Pat Barrington? 
[03:58:30]  I think that was  No that was the other one  The Swedish  No  Fuck  Reving up on runway number one  Is punctuous Pat Barrington  Pat Barrington  A minuscently configured female  Skill in the art of the topless  The topless  I beg you to try to listen to what she has to say  All that you're doing is a dance  It has no meaning whatsoever  There are gyrations and so on  Suggestive movements  But still it is entertainment  And there is no other meaning 
[03:59:00]  Other than a dance  Other than a dance  How many times did you say that name over the weekend?  I probably said it wrong too  I've been saying Pat Barrington  It's Pat Barrington  Barrington  Barrington  Relax and enjoy exciting Donna X  Cuno-esque of proportion  Listen closely to what she has to say about topless  Oh I think everybody goes by moods  You might make it every night  A steady thing for a month  And then you might lay off for a whole complete reason 
[03:59:30]  You're not even needed at all  It depends on your mental attitude  Holy shit  Listen to this idiot babble  She says mental  I like that  She's addicted to the art of the topless  The topless  And away we go with Luchess and Lanae  Svelte and lidesome  Give us a word, Sim  I can be around anything green  And have a feeling of sensation run through my body  Only because it is a feeling of nature  It is a feeling of freedom 
[04:00:00]  Is it?  I was trying to find out what you were talking about  I know, I love that one  The topless  Maybe this is it  Hang on men and zero in on bouncy babbitts  Bardot  French and Swedish  50-50 where it counts  Speak to us babbitts, baby  I try to project a childlike to a woman quality  That ain't her  Because I do believe that men don't like so much odd sex  They like softness also  So I try to project both 
[04:00:30]  Sexuality and also gentleness  So I do  With a muff like a Wookie  In a very gentle way  Hold on  Her cunt smells like the sweaty ankles of a homeless person  Good impersonation  It's the type of audience that finds more enjoyment from a dancer  Than you give them dancing  If they find more enjoyment from slower movements  And more suggestive movements than you give them that 
[04:01:00]  Where's the dope talking about the erotica  Or the exotic  Well I feel that personality has a lot to do with it  And I think that I have been able to present a personality  That is a little different than a lot of girls have  I can't find it  I love her  The topless is quite different from the exotic field  Because there I am vivacious and alive and full of the devil  Don't get me wrong  I am sometimes vivacious in my exotic work also 
[04:01:30]  But there are two different types of moods entirely  Where in the exotic field  Everything is done with slow enticing movements  And a teasing type form  Where in my topless  I am just vivacious  And full of warmth  And like  We'd like to have some fun  So when she's naked  Or something  Or doing her exotic  That's the one?
