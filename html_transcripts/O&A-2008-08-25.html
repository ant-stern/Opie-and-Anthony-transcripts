<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the Beijing Olympics, marked by the hosts' low personal interest despite high viewership numbers.  They commented on the physical changes in female gymnasts after the games and the absence of Led Zeppelin (only Jimmy Page appeared) at the closing ceremony, speculating about Robert Plant's reasons. This segued into a discussion of a Cuban Taekwondo athlete banned for life for kicking a referee, with the hosts expressing surprise at the lack of online video footage.

The conversation then shifted to the upcoming US presidential election.  The hosts accurately predicted Barack Obama's choice of Joe Biden as his running mate, and subsequently discussed the political conventions, including allegations of increased prostitution during these events and Ted Kennedy's health.  They also commented on a perceived misstatement during Obama and Biden's first joint appearance, and discussed Biden's age and net worth, along with speculation about McCain's potential running mate (Mitt Romney).  Other news items discussed included a Bentley driver suing the NYPD after a hit-and-run, high gas prices, Michael Bloomberg's proposed windmills for NYC buildings, and a listener's sighting of Opie driving a Ford GT.  The segment included listener calls relating to plane crashes, a deceased one-legged prostitute, and various personal frustrations. David Blaine's upcoming stunt in Central Park was also mentioned and compared to older radio bits.  A comedically enhanced news soundbite about Cindy McCain's wrist injury was played, and the hosts discussed a male school custodian transitioning to female, focusing on the impact on their son.

A substantial portion focused on a 54-year-old school janitor in Oxford, Massachusetts, who was transitioning genders. The hosts and callers discussed the potential for teasing, the janitor's appearance, and the appropriateness of his actions given his age. Comparisons were drawn to other gender transitions, including that of a mailman.  Callers shared their own anecdotes regarding gender transitions in their communities.

The show then delved into videos from a previous Friday's show. These featured K-Rock girls, including one punching a show staffer (Iraq) in the stomach; and Pat Duffy and his new Russian girlfriend engaged in violent sexual activity, including slapping, biting, and a groin kick by the Russian woman. The hosts described the videos in detail, emphasizing the violence.  A call from the Russian girlfriend detailed her experiences with Pat Duffy, her exposure to cannibalism in Russia, and her preference for violent sexual encounters.  The show also referenced a previous segment involving Chuck Farnham, repeatedly punched in the breast by a woman, and mentioned that a video of the groin kick was being re-edited to focus solely on that action.


The show also covered the Opie and Anthony show's removal from BCN, the upcoming MTV Video Music Awards (hosted by Russell Brand), a remake of *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*, a suspended Texas police officer who had sex with prostitutes during an undercover operation, and a caller's encounter with a pre-op transgender person at a *Rocky Horror Picture Show* performance.  *Family Feud* and its new host, John O'Hurley, were also discussed.

Another segment discussed inaccurate Florida weather forecasts, the surprising number of library users, and a Pennsylvania man who listed Jim Norton and several serial killers (including Edmund Kemper, Robert Hansen, and Ted Bundy) as "heroes" on his MySpace page.  Callers provided details about the killers' crimes.  The show also covered a nine-year-old girl banned from a junior tennis competition for grunting too loudly, transitioning into commentary on the grunting habits of professional female tennis players.  M. Night Shyamalan's films and personality were briefly discussed.  The segment concluded with a discussion of golf video games, Anthony's broken computer, his jacuzzi's malfunctioning temperature control, an anecdote involving a guest and an overflowing jacuzzi, listener calls about saltwater fish tanks, and audio clips of a couple slapping each other during sex.

The final segment featured the mocking of stand-up comedy bits,  an email from "Carol Fergal" criticizing Jimmy's appearance on Fox's Red Eye, resulting in a heated exchange. A listener's request for self-pleasure advice led to a graphic description of a suggested method.  A video of a woman repeatedly kicking a man in the groin was shown, followed by an email from Pamela Paul of the New York Times book review, prompting highly vulgar and misogynistic responses from the hosts.  A Fox News reporter's encounter with anti-war protesters was shown, followed by a discussion of a 911 operator's mistake leading to a woman's death, and complaints about digital cable.  The show then devolved into a lengthy, vulgar, and sexually suggestive discussion of *Gilligan's Island*, followed by discussions of Vice President Biden's appearance, a public access debate between an atheist and a religious person, and an extended and highly detailed, offensive dissection of the movie *Mask* and its portrayal of Rocky Dennis.  The show concluded with listener calls about Rocky Dennis and further discussion of *Mask*, punctuated by vulgar and offensive remarks.

[00:02:00]  two points two points then before you know it the score goes into the hundreds  yeah it's like what yeah yeah yeah and what happened with uh uh jimmy page at the closing  ceremonies i had to go to bed why didn't they get all of zeppelin were they supposed to get all of  zeppelin and then robert plant had one of his attitude attacks and decided that he can't do this  because there weren't enough people watching or something i didn't hear that story i just heard 
[00:02:30]  it was page and that leona lewis yeah but think it out man yeah yeah you're the beijing olympics you're  in charge of the closing ceremonies you don't want page you want zeppelin so obviously they  tried for zeppelin they got page so what's the story well there's some controversy too about  whole lot of love being too uh too heated a little too racy that's why the olympics are like irrelevant  because they think that this is too dirty yeah saying a whole lot of love a whole lot of love is  very dirty every inch it's all about an orgasm i mean that the whole mid yeah the whole midsection 
[00:03:00]  of that song is an orgasm it's robert plant moaning and groaning with juice running down his leg  well why just why just page that doesn't sound right and why uh why isn't zeppelin touring  they had that nice concert and uh everyone was getting excited for like zeppelin coming back and  then robert plant what he decided he wanted to play the cello or something  these guys just stick with what you know what are you doing we want to see zeppelin 
[00:03:30]  yeah we don't want to see jimmy page playing a guitar i mean we do but you know you want the  robert plant accompaniment maybe even they know how disappointing plant is live  yeah mass grow it people just go like oh he doesn't sound like zeppelin  my god jimmy jimmy's got his oatmeal with with his uh maple syrup on it and i swear i thought  electronics were burning in here it smells like a burning uh like printed circuit board like a pc 
[00:04:00]  board burning it's it's awful and i love oatmeal but that one is just awful good and good for you  yeah is it really sticks to your ribs it sure does and everything else so we say goodbye to the  olympics yeah thunder was number one at the box office wait taekwondo in the olympics how great was  act the cuban they banned for life i know i for life yes anthony yes well i don't know a lot of  people probably were driving going for life the same time i did i'm the voice of people that didn't 
[00:04:30]  watch at this point i think you're not even like going to news sites anymore what that that that  cuban taekwondo thing was huge that was on the front page of every news website because i don't know  what happened in the olympics doesn't mean i don't go to news sites this transcended everything  my friend not it didn't transcend uh joseph biden being uh uh obama's pick well that that i know  about i don't know about some crappy uh olympic uh cuban band for life guy well you know about the 
[00:05:00]  biden thing because he texted you personally to tell you that he picked uh you know joseph biden yes no  the taekwondo guy what was the story he didn't win the medal or he swept the leg right i knew it  no he got uh listen to sensei and he went down for his little uh like a timeout right right right  exceeded the a lot of time and the referee dq'd him called him out so he got up and and knocked  out the ref basically with a kick kicked him in the face he's banned for life oh jeez it's a 
[00:05:30]  enyo enyo valoria mejos kicked the referee right in the face his name is mel  because sosa says so i think it's a good move on his part because now i think everybody wants to  see this guy do a little taekwondo no one knew who he was before the big kick to the referee's skull  oh he'll probably end up in uh yeah he'll be mma he'll be in a basement or something fighting  is there a clip of that huh no because the nbc in this day and age pretty amazing you can't get 
[00:06:00]  an olympic clip on youtube it's impossible they they must have someone just watching that yeah  they must have a team of people watching just exclusively watching youtube because i've only  seen the still photo of the the cuban kick knocking out the ref so i went to youtube and there's a  million versions of it five stars so you know it's the video you click on it nothing they're they're  able to get rid of everything as soon as it goes up there because they want you to buy the dvd now  i actually got i got it i saw a version google try try cuban kicks referee again maybe you saw it 
[00:06:30]  yeah once you know one of them came up gone and one of them the next one googled came up  and on youtube and i was gonna still picture of it yes holy mother of god how high his leg is yeah  this guy was not happy wow this guy was not happy you see it from a little farther away though and  the video clip you can't see it's not that close um and you just all of a sudden he just kicks the  guy in the face because he was disqualified and then he pushed another official um wow he's in  trouble not quite uh the discipline you're supposed to have with uh no it's not on youtube daniel those are 
[00:07:00]  the ones i checked and they they're already gone see they are not on youtube man all right whatever  so that's going on but yeah the joseph biden thing we said it on this show i mean a lot of people think  we're just goofy shock jocks but we all said obama needs old white guy even stunt brain who studies  this stuff uh we beat him too because he's like no way is it going to be biden we're like it's going to  be uh old white guy so it most likely could be biden yeah you thought it was going to be some  chick yeah i thought well after biden said no and i even said if he took biden he gets the foreign 
[00:07:30]  policy experience but biden kept saying i'm not the guy i'm not the guy he's he lied he's a liar he  lied to the american people big fat liar he was asked and uh he said no no one's talked to me about it i  don't know no it's not going to be me yeah and then there he is yeah hello hugging mrs obama on  stage how uncomfortable did that look well it looks like stage it looked like a swingers convention 
[00:08:00]  because they were both hugging the other one's wife the other one's wives yeah that was pretty hot  let's get to know each other a little bit yeah before denver come on a little cream in your coffee  there baby oh they were really like it was this fake love fest on stage why it's so forced he picked  me what what what what what uh by the way we got a second fiddle to it the hell is that what we have 
[00:08:30]  to go back in time this was a mere week or so ago at the delorean our own stunt brain this is what he  had to say about who obama was going to pick all right remember about a week ago that obama will  announce before saturday and mccain said he's going to do it on his birthday stunt brain is such a bore  that he studies this stuff i love it who do you think i think obama is going to go with i still think  it's katherine sebelius the governor of kansas that is what um obama's gonna what katherine sebelius 
[00:09:00]  the governor of kansas you're insane stump brain i know you're a smart man but if you're gonna go broad  you gotta go hillary i was taking a chance hey punditry does not pay and that's proof you went  for the uh long shot i did and uh by the way yeah she was on uh tv for maybe two seconds as a  possibility yeah they're like and maybe this broad and that was it was like quick boom and then they  went back to biden and the real like favorites you bet on the horse that ended up with the tent over it  yeah and then uh stump brain continued with this when is barack announcing his vp uh today 
[00:09:30]  they're saying it might be biden it wouldn't know biden seems to have dropped out of the running  biden scares me biden would have been a good pick for his foreign policy experience but he's too far  out there for the rest of it yeah well good call kreskin right on that one you said sebelius you're  like yeah because he wants the midwest yeah that'll win the heartland over a black guy and a white  woman yeah black guy and a white woman's always done good down south you looking at her boy 
[00:10:00]  obama made a good choice who else was out there who else was out there in the in the old white guy  category true hillary and they're saying ted kennedy's checking out could be weeks at this point what do  you mean checking out checking out checking out from the planet and checking out from the planet  that's it that bad huh they should they should make him talk at the uh the convention oh god  this dumb convention that uh stunt brain was teaching me this morning that we don't need to 
[00:10:30]  do conventions anymore this is a gigantic waste of time we could do this in an afternoon on the  internet not heat up the planet for four days but then how are all these guys going to get their  prostitutes no that's true we last time they had a convention we did all the stories and the  prostitution was way up yeah in that city the last whatever city they had it in last time i don't  remember for the conventions are very big so denver is uh denver's like a big prostitute gathering too  well a lot of these guys will be getting prostitutes yes yeah yeah i don't want to name names i don't 
[00:11:00]  feel like getting sued today but uh it's a known fact that the business goes up wow yeah sure all those  guys in town forget about it 50 000 people waste the time and every network's going to cover it for  the next five days and and that's the dumb thing where they go and the great state of blah blah blah  known for textiles known for its multi-grain pasta what we cast our vote oh god we cast all 22 of our 
[00:11:30]  delegates to barack obama and joseph biden yeah the great state that's like they should be wearing  those big stovepipe hat stuffs of stuff that's how that's how old that custom is yeah yeah it's just a  rah rah let's kiss each other's uh yeah what's and let's uh you know what each other and let's give  each other a rusty trombone let's let's just like really just have a good time they're talking about 
[00:12:00]  flying ted kennedy in for his like farewell convention oh oh my god so he was okay you got  the thing removed no no it's growing and growing fast and that's huge that national choir that  usually gets those stories is the national choir what's on my desk oh there was the globe they're  saying a couple weeks to live and those papers like the national choir and the globe they're pretty  accurate pretty good yeah all right and then you got this obama and biden uh misspeak during their  first speech oh so they're they're not on the they're they're not on the same page and i didn't 
[00:12:30]  they're a little rusty this is what barack uh barack announces biden as the next president  we will restore that fair shot at your dreams that is at the core of who joe biden is and i am  and what america is as a nation so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president  of the united states of america joe biden i'm sure i'm sure according to some guy in the south 
[00:13:00]  right now cleaning certain pieces of hardware he is the next president wow yikes and then biden calls  obama much he pretty much uh put himself in a very very uh awkward position because uh i think there  are some extremists in this country that might enjoy a white guy in there an old white older  white guy in there than uh obama and uh you know as far as some some lunatics and uh extremists see 
[00:13:30]  it there's only one way to do that so i don't know i think the secret service is going to have to  be on their toes with this one oh this guy is going to be the most protected president in the history  yeah because if you think uh a police beating caught on tape riles people up  hoofa oh man that would cause some problems yeah and then uh biden calls obama barack america 
[00:14:00]  my friends i don't have to tell you this election year the choice is clear  one man stands ready to deliver change we desperately need a man i'm proud to call my  friend a man who will be the next president of the united states barack america  oh he's misspeaking and everything barack america what's his name i can't even say it 
[00:14:30]  what how old is this biden barack america barack america he's only 62 i think he's a little older  doesn't he come on he's got to be older than 62 he have a brain tumor he's he had an aneurysm he's  been in office for 30 years in delaware he was sworn in right after his wife and and kid were in a  horrible car wreck he was actually at his kid's hospital bed after the wife died and actually  so he's been a senator forever for 30 some years in delaware and they say uh part of the pick is he'll 
[00:15:00]  bring in uh the keystone state yes pennsylvania to and uh the working class yeah sure apparently  his net worth is uh like between 100 and 150 000 so he's like not one of these rich guys and yeah  he's just pretty much dedicated himself to uh civil service helping people  did he do a savings account 30 years as a senator if you're like going on speaking engagements i  mean you don't pocket a little something for yourself i'm sure i don't think he's been doing 
[00:15:30]  that hidden somewhere that's just it he hasn't been doing speaking engagements or books or anything  like that he just kind of goes to his job draws his salary and uh that's it wow maybe he's stupid  you know cash in oh of course he's stupid barack america barack america  well we'll see who mccain picks it's probably gonna be mitt romney i'm thinking yeah oh wait  is that official no this is the curse of deathy i believe it's mitt romney joe biden is 65 no it's 
[00:16:00]  weird it's like when you run for the presidency it's it's at a time in your life when everyone  else starts thinking of retiring and moving to florida and that and that's when they go for  their biggest gig you notice they're starting to get a little dodgy it just doesn't seem right  yeah that these guys in their 60s and what's mccain now 70 yeah 72 and now he's going for the  biggest gig of his life at 72 years old that just seemed really just bizarre we really need just a

[00:24:00]  hello it'd be funny if that was like if bloomberg or some politician was so out of touch this is their  answer for like the rising gas prices if they have no concept of like what other americans made  just buy a ford gt yes you can drive faster you'll get there quicker that's what i say  speaking of bloomberg uh being out of touch i we i don't even think we talked about this it was last  week early last week he decided that we needed windmills on all the buildings here in new york  city yeah and the bridges and uh it i think it's it's it's a it's a noble idea but it looks like a lot 
[00:24:30]  of hardcore like politicians and stuff kind of laughed at him and he kind of dropped his whole  windmill platform immediately that thing was in and out of the paper within like 24 hours yeah  and then uh john montone was on the streets of new york and everyone's like but new york's not the  windy city chicago is chicago's the windy city not new york it doesn't have to be the windy city it  could be a windy city i know there's certain times of the year that the you get quite gusty winds 
[00:25:00]  it's actually a great idea but but you know this city's so old school like we don't like change  no this mills this city changes very very very slowly very slowly and i like how we had to go  back to a technology they used like uh i don't know thousands of years ago windmills the hell is  this water world come on what the solution for the energy crisis a bunch of amish women like churning 
[00:25:30]  churn your own butter go green he started to annoy me bloomberg he did this thing i was in a cab going  downtown and there's a lot of lane herald square here in manhattan which is where macy's is uh that's  where the thanksgiving day parade uh ends for the people around the country sure it's a very famous  like 34th street and i went broadway right around there it's a very famous little corner it stinks  it's all pedestrians and what bloomberg has done is going downtown he has removed southbound lanes and 
[00:26:00]  put in bike lanes which is fine because a lot of people are on bikes now but then he's taking another  lane out and he's putting these giant potted plants in and then you see like cafe uh people sitting  there sipping their cappuccinos around little tables that are set up where the street used to be that  is just you you we're trying to drive in this city could you leave the lanes there they don't  want you driving in this city he's choking off uh lanes his little traffic plan didn't go through 
[00:26:30]  where he wanted to uh you know charge people to come into midtown so now he's doing the next best  thing uh he thinks is to take a bunch of lanes away so people go screw it i'm taking the bus  or the subway or the long island railroad or path or something he's making traffic worse on purpose  and it's really irritating it's stupid you don't have to do that to make a living  you know everyone's not a billionaire and he's like i take the subway so yeah well you happen to  have state troopers with you a lot of people aren't comfortable taking the subway at all hours of the  night yeah and if he needed to get through traffic he would be able to have an escort take him through 
[00:27:00]  traffic yeah it's really irritating he's got a motorcade they're talking uh of changing the rules so he  could have a third term my friends here in new york city i tried doing that with rudy and louis ck not louis ck  louis black said that he should be our next president this bloomberg really he thinks  bloomberg would be a great choice for the presidency they're both jewish yeah let's say hi to matt on  long island he i think he saw you yeah matt what's up hey guys how's it going yeah i saw that ticket

[00:29:00]  thinking sucks to be you yeah unlucky lottery things have to happen that are really rare like  unlucky lottery i always say if there's a boulder sitting on top of a a hill with a road next to it  and you know that boulder has been there for a million million million years and dinosaurs dinosaurs  saw that rock yeah and the second your car drives past it somehow it picks that time to roll down 
[00:29:30]  the hill and crush your car that is unlucky lottery sucks to be you is when something happens it doesn't  necessarily have to be out of the ordinary it just sucks that it happened to you so uh i don't know  planes crash all the time they crash into houses but i don't think it's so much unlucky lottery it sucks  to be you there were a lot of little plane crashes over the weekend you had the one uh crashing into  the little league field right he was trying to find an airport and found a field instead yeah  found a little league field that's a short runway i think the guy survived the crash though right yeah

[00:35:30]  yellow sir yeah i was wondering uh any chance you're gonna get the uh opportunity to drive the  one thousand horsepower 16 cylinder bugatti veyron oh yes i own one no you don't own one but uh  of course i don't what what are those they're very fast cars it pops out at 253 mile an hour but  you'll never get the second key to do that and it's very ugly it's not a pretty looking car the bugatti 
[00:36:00]  have you ever seen a vehicle if you do the youtube search and you can watch them and i've never seen  a vehicle where the speedometer constantly goes fast i mean it just keeps going up and up and up  and it's quite uh quite impressive do they have bugattis in your car club and no no bugatti or they  would have probably just one right uh yeah and i don't know who they'd give that out to a bugatti 
[00:36:30]  is that what they call it when when a bunch of those cars are driven onto a girl's face no okay  something else  uh stephen s from basher getting back to that hooker story did the headline read stomp clump thump  so there you have it there you have it indeed the bugatti who makes that bugatti  yeah all right that's a dumb looking little car million dollars it looks like a little car 
[00:37:00]  kind of half in the shell of another car yeah yeah it's not a nice looking car but uh i guess if you  want to drive a real fast that's the car it's a car that looks like it's in the middle of shedding  yeah shedding its skin and the new car is about to pop out right speaking of uh prius steve is sick  again what this guy is sick a lot oh boy that's not good this steve guy is sick a lot he wearing a

[00:41:00]  know we're not fans of david blaine he's quite a tool his street magic stuff is really cool it  really is although i think a lot of that stuff is set up too it's fake but um he just announces uh  his next stunt for everybody yeah because he's great and we need someone like him in our lives to  entertain us what were some of the stunts he did in the past that was oh my goodness when he was uh  frozen in a block of ice yeah he was uh in the globe full of water yeah um uh 
[00:41:30]  he stood on a stand in bryant park for like five days yes just on a platform yeah a little  platform he stood there let's not forget the glass box over where was it london well he was in trump  buried alive remember ah yeah but let's see we suck in america in london he does the glass box above  what the thames rivers the thames right right and uh the london people were not going to have this 
[00:42:00]  and they started throwing all sort of throwing things at him and shooting balls at it and paint  balls they're like they see they they acknowledge that this guy's a hack but in america we're like  oh my god you hear what david blaine's gonna do next and i was uh walking with roland after the  show friday and we were talking about david blaine because i think he's trying to get him for the show  and i'm like this guy all he's doing and maybe stump brain could help me is uh morning zoo bits  like any intern no no no not even a joke like in the late 80s maybe early 90s mid to late 80s 
[00:42:30]  definitely these bits were offered to morning zoos oh yeah buried alive you're gonna there was a  company that would come in and they would bury your morning show for a week at a car dealership and it  was the big i can't believe we're gonna be buried alive uh friday and then uh uh frozen in a block  of ice that used to be an old morning zoo bit i'm telling you all he's doing is recycling old  morning zoo bits great it's kind of scary but you're absolutely right i would love to uh find that 
[00:43:00]  company i forgot their name but they would come in and do the big morning zoo bit for you for for uh for  your town and and they were burying morning shows and putting them in blocks of ice and all this  stuff and that's all david blaine's doing but now his latest start what ready for this gotta be a biggie  this is a biggie absolutely he's gonna hang upside down at central park not one not two but three days 
[00:43:30]  why doesn't he just do it in his house why does he have to do it in the park so we could all watch  and go wow look how great he is so we can admire him because he does stuff we can't do jimmy people uh  do like to gather around uh his events for some reason yeah and i think he knows that yeah and uh you  know pumps it up and does it in public places well we say this every time he announces his uh his next  stunt how does he get the permits like jimmy was saying during the break but we say this every 
[00:44:00]  time how does he get the permits to do this crap we can't get permits for anything we can't get a  venue in boston to perform the traveling virus show at within 40 miles of the city yeah he's hanging  naked by his scrotum all over how yeah oh it'd be something if he did it naked yeah you know and what uh  what is this supposed to do hanging upside down what do i mean it sounds like it sucks what what do any of  his stunts have it like remember when he was in the big fishbowl yeah but that was in uh was he in 
[00:44:30]  water he was in water with a breathing apparatus and then at the end of it he tries to set the  record for like holding his breath holding his breath okay see at least that's something it was  a complete failure that sucks too well i guess it's something like and then the block of ice is a block  of ice so it's cold but it's not really i guess hanging upside down though like the blood flow to your  brain blah blah blah could cause blah blah blah they'll have the medical experts blah blah blah  you should have it uh where he's hanging upside down but if he just hangs there his head is 
[00:45:00]  underwater so he's got to constantly keep like up at an angle and keep his head up above the water now  that's a trick oh and then he's gonna need a chiropractor yeah he's gonna be a little bent up  hunchback there he is in a fishbowl with scuba gear on that's just wonderful i mean it looks nice and  all but what is he doing what does that accomplish yeah people walk by i think uh like the mayor 
[00:45:30]  constantly is blurting out how much money is being brought into the city by events stupid things like  this like the stupid waterfalls that they set up and it's like this will bring in 600 million dollars  to the city like how does that happen how could you figure that out the waterfall thing was such a  bust too because one we said it looks like a uh uh uh a what a sewage treatment plant yeah that's  what it looked like it's just awful and the the one under the brooklyn bridge is is like uh wrecking 
[00:46:00]  trees yeah on the brooklyn side yeah the salt water was blowing in the breeze and hitting the trees and  killing them didn't work out too well but how does david blaine being in the city get revenue to the city  are people just going like gotta go to new york honey david blaine's gonna be in a hanging upside  dan like what i can't imagine anyone would come to new york specifically for that i there's such 
[00:46:30]  boring tricks i don't i don't get it i don't get why he's allowed to do it i don't get why uh we  you know we'll march by and go oh we got to check him out he's hanging upside down this time  yeah i don't i just don't get it me and voss years ago did go back by trump a little his little  complex like in the 60s on the west side and we did see him when he was down under under the uh  water underground just to look at it yeah but wasn't that like a glass top and you could just see him  under that's easy it's like you look that's morning show stuff i'm telling you looking through a glass 
[00:47:00]  top and you're like looking it's almost like looking into a well right and he's he's laying down  there but it was like well what is that i don't know it's silly it's just it's dumb there's a guy down  there anyone could do that look at that he's sleeping and uh we're looking at him like idiots  smoking just drop a deuce on top of him how great would that be because then the security guy would  have to kick it off smear yeah it's a windex and it's hanky all right uh we got we got uh obama 
[00:47:30]  picking biden and mccain's already running the political ads oh yeah making oh yeah making fun of  the fact uh because everyone thought a lot of people thought he should have picked hillary  and mccain is saying well he didn't pick hillary for for a couple reasons here and now they got  ads running listen to this she won millions of votes but isn't on his ticket why for speaking the  truth on his plans you never hear the specifics on the resco scandal we still don't have a lot of  answers about senator obama on his attacks senator obama's campaign has become increasingly negative 
[00:48:00]  the truth hurt and obama didn't like it i'm john mccain and i approve this message i'm john mccain  and boy did i approve this message it you could tell it was taken every one of those clips was taken  so out of context even if she did mean it yeah like i'm sure there was some kind of preface and then  i love you know some kind of thing after she said that that that doesn't make it sound as bad 
[00:48:30]  they just clip them out put them in i approve this attack them and that whole john i approve  this message he he record that uh he you know barack obama months ago if not a year ago  i approve this message i'm john mccain and i certainly approve this message and i believe he's a  why doesn't obama just do the exact same thing when mccain announces just pick someone  he will on the ticket he will silly yeah they just go after each other it's a joke this whole 
[00:49:00]  process yeah the democrats all had to sit there and debate each other so of course they're not going  to agree they're going to bash the other guy and then you use those in an ad and then we got this one  what does barack obama's running mate say about barack obama you were asked is he ready you said i think  he can be ready but right now i don't believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself 
[00:49:30]  to on-the-job training i think that i stand by the statement and what does he say about john mccain  i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off  well i'm john mccain and i approve this message of course you do that's what biden said biden oh  yikes biden is a guy is a guy who's out for biden oh wow they just wow what a joke the primaries 
[00:50:00]  are like what a bunch of liars they are yeah that they just attack each other and then side with each  other and they're like i forget i said that it's like i didn't say it so did you say it just because  you were trying to get the job so it's a lie or is it the truth do you think that he's not  experienced enough and uh the presidency isn't an on-the-job training job uh or were you just saying  this because you wanted to win so you made some stuff up both sides it's one or the other both sides 
[00:50:30]  do it though it's still Obama's gonna have some fine ads to counter this one yeah well they're also  calling uh biden obama's little uh lap dog so he's the guy that could go out and do the attacks  on mccain he's known mccain for years worked with him so he can actually attack him and  then uh obama will be playing good cop so it'd be good cop bad cop kind of a thing by the way biden  got some fine hair plugs yes he did you just know that was yeah they they had old school biden when he 
[00:51:00]  he had the dark jet black hair and he he barely had anything happening up top and now he's got a  full head of gray hair really hey they're figuring out that hair transplant man put in that barbie doll  stuff or just it didn't look too barbie dollish no no but so that's uh what biden said about obama  wow you know what's funny you watch what hillary does this week what she's gonna do the biggest  kiss ass act ever oh yeah is she uh scheduled to speak of course she is tomorrow at the convention 
[00:51:30]  she is going to kiss some obama ass we gotta get sounds of that oh my god is she gonna change  her tune tomorrow we need a man like barack obama to be the next president of the year  i have to listen to her again and then what obama's wife tonight tonight yeah she's michelle 
[00:52:00]  obama's kicking off the convention tonight and hillary's tomorrow she's kicking it why is the wife  of this guy uh getting up there and and babbling she's finally proud of america well because they're  trying so hard because just like your ex-wife she's responsible for his success my friend apparently  so i just think it's um she's gonna be a lot more self-serving you think yeah she'll be a lot more  polished she can't be though they've had it's very hard she she has a very difficult time taking direction 
[00:52:30]  she doesn't uh she doesn't she doesn't really she's not likable she gets up there and talks like  obama is a likable guy he gets something you got to give him that he gives his speeches people like  him she gets up there and talks and people are just like oh boy i don't think i like this broad i like  the older footage meaning like a year ago when uh you know michelle and barack sit down for the 
[00:53:00]  interviews and you can see barack is like oh okay honey all right honey i'll take it from here  why don't you keep your mouth shut on this subject he's trying to get on he's trying to get control  of the situation he's very nervous okay so um what do you think of whitey well let me tell you about  oh well now i don't i think that's a derogatory term that we should should not use i'll talk about 
[00:53:30]  whitey oh she's ready to roll yeah so she's gonna get up there and i guess try to appear likable  by reading a speech written by people that um wrote something that maybe might make her likable  she's uh i doubt it we've all had the girlfriend where uh you know the girlfriend gets you in  trouble michelle obama's that type of girlfriend oh yeah where she's like you know there's a hell's  angel guy that just cuts you off and you know she has to reach over and beep the horn like whoa what  are you doing call him a douche out the window yeah giving the finger like whoa whoa i'll take 
[00:54:00]  care of this oh dude feel free to punch her right throwing drinks in the face of some six foot five  monster in a bar like yeah great now i gotta fight and i gotta fight the six five monster now thank you  sweetie he's bothering me yeah take care of it we've all had that girl in our lives it's like chill the  f out please i don't feel like losing my teeth so what uh any indication on what she's going to 
[00:54:30]  talk about or is this just a rah-rah is she introducing barack uh no she's just kicking  off the convention it's kind of a meeting her deal but the big news is tomorrow hillary's thing there's  two two big issues coming up the people who made the movie about bill the man from hope uh-huh have  made one allegedly that will be shown tomorrow and hillary is supposed to dispatch her delegates and  tell them to go to barack of course yeah go and they gave michigan and florida full voting rights 
[00:55:00]  after all the screaming and hollering oh really yeah so everybody's back in  is it worth watching no i remember though i watched the convention i guess it was four years  ago and barack obama talked and i went wow could that guy talk keynote speaker yeah there's always  very impressive there's always one great speech remember cuomo's speech in like 80 that was a killer  speech but then the rest of it is just a waste of time it's stuff we already know it's one big party  it's a big kiss ass party where they just say rah rah look we're all united behind obama and then we 
[00:55:30]  got this old clip of biden calling obama the first mainstream african-american who's clean and bright  okay we go back a little bit this is what biden had to say before he was uh picked to be the vice  president i mean you got the first sort of mainstream african america who was articulate and bright and  clean and nice looking guy i mean it's that's a storybook man he sounds drunk yeah you ever go to 
[00:56:00]  a drunk guy and tell him well what do you think oh let me tell what i think i think what what's wrong  with him saying that someone's asking me what i think kind of is as far as he's he's accepted by  white people is what you're saying and those attributes that he brought up are things that  white people want to see in a minority or ethnic uh uh candidate you don't you don't want to see a guy  like uh 50 cent getting up there it's not really gonna gonna help he meant he's articulate he looks 
[00:56:30]  good he looks the part i think that it just comes off like whenever whenever you say that it almost  sounds even though those things are technically correct it sounds too paternalistic it's it's almost  like uh if a jewish guy was running and uh and a guy's like well you know he's he's the first uh  viable jewish candidate he's very generous uh even if that was the truth he's very generous  is he yeah i've seen him tip it still sounds like yeah well technically that's true but it's it's 
[00:57:00]  almost like clean cut and articulate has typically sounded like a snotty elitist white person surprised  that the black guy's not robbing them thing to say you know what i i don't think it's that extreme  though i don't think he meant it that extreme i think he means you know when you look at people like  uh uh black leaders farrakhan reverend al things like that uh yeah and completely  insane i like glasses good smile great speaker nice ties like uh it's it's just 
[00:57:30]  you know i think what he meant is he's more universally accepted because of those attributes  than uh uh many of the former black leaders have been so but he didn't come out and just go look i  think he's the most viable black candidate this country's ever had like that to me is  whatever you start saying he's clean cut he's our ticket it sounds like two adults right  discussing a child a child he's so smart yeah oh my god and look how cute coochie coochie coo 
[00:58:00]  yeah you're yeah i see your point on that one he's not talking about other white candidates  being articulate of course if you get that far chances are you you you're fairly articulate  you're not a blithering retard if you're running for well president well  well you know put myself get in there you can still get in yeah hey uh before we take a break  i i want to do this one more time we played the beep game with the uh mccain uh hurting her wrist 
[00:58:30]  thing all right hurting her wrist cindy mccain sure who's very very wealthy yeah apparently extremely wealthy  yeah um we got the original story so bear with us it's like a minute and then we uh threw some beeps  and it made it very in my opinion very very funny a little racy yeah here's the original story some  politicians say it's an injury waiting to happen and it happened to cindy mccain wednesday when one 
[00:59:00]  supporter took things a little too far i'm absolutely fine just we had a great lunch and fundraiser and i  i shook hands and it was still a very enthusiastic supporter mrs mccain had surgery for a wrist injury  several years ago wednesday's firm handshake aggravated the injury and left her in a sling  how firm was the handshake yeah that was a good one  while some believe good handshaking could be considered an art form experts say the action 
[00:59:30]  should be taken seriously because injuries on the campaign trail are actually quite common  so much so that the american occupational therapy association  devoted a whole campaign to helping people stay safe while meeting and greeting on the trail keeping  your you know your elbow at a 90 degree angle is actually optimal um protecting the you know shoulder  and back by not reaching forward and over things and into crowds yeah so whatever it's a whatever story 
[01:00:00]  i understand but then uh sam took that and put some beeps into it some politicians say it's an injury  waiting to happen and it happened to cindy mccain wednesday when one supporter took things a little  too far i'm absolutely fine just we had a great lunch and fundraiser and i i very enthusiastic  supporter mrs mccain had surgery for a injury several years ago wednesday's aggravated the injury 
[01:00:30]  while some believe good could be considered an art form experts say the action should be taken  seriously because injuries on the are actually quite common so much so that the american association  devoted a whole campaign to helping people stay safe while being and being on the keeping your you  know your at a 90 degree angle is actually optimal um protecting the by not reaching forward and over

[01:02:00]  decided to become uh i think a girl  some custodian what it's a janitor it's a janitor what yeah um really awful looking  size i think i'm gonna i haven't read the story in a week i think he's 54  from memory uh and he didn't have the money or something to get the operation so he just kind of  looks goofy he looks like peter chris that's the guy i talked about right right right he looks like 
[01:02:30]  peter chris that's very good here here's uh the story of kids will be heading back to class at  clara barton elementary school in oxford next week they'll have new classrooms new teachers and a  new custodian well not exactly 54 year old brian bonin will be back for his ninth year on the job  as brianna of course why do they always do that brian is now brianna why can't they just pick a new  name exactly yeah because you can't possibly like because your whole family's like brian what are you

[01:03:30]  fact that he's gonna get chopped yes we'll be back for his ninth year on the job as brianna bonin he  will be living and working as a woman every person has a right to you know live how they want to live  bonin told a local paper that he was terrified he'd lose his job when he revealed plans to change his  gender but he says the school has been very supportive administrators sent a letter home to  parents about what to say to their children reading in part the best thing to tell them 
[01:04:00]  is that our custodian used to be a man she has changed her gender role and is now a woman i had  to demonstrate on with a banana and a knife in case the kid is really confused about how that happens  stupid but he looks like a dude still he's awful he just grew his hair like jimmy said to look like  peter chris doesn't even look like he's taking hormones he looks like a burn victim look at his  face that he's got the fake right right right yeah he's not a good and you're 54 years old first of 
[01:04:30]  all oh why don't you just live out your life yeah guy you screwed up you should have done it earlier  in life that's for the young yeah it really is getting your schlong cut off uh is for the young you  see these things walking around uh manhattan every once in a while and they have to wear like old  school dresses and they they wear old school pocket books and old school glasses like what  are you doing if you're gonna do this why why don't you like try to sex it up at least yeah  do when you're younger no nothing worse than a new vagina on an old man 
[01:05:00]  just creepy  and is now a woman i agree that they should still have their job i don't have a problem with that  but the situation is causing some controversy in this town not everyone thinks the students will  adjust well to the change i think he he she or whatever should have compassion for the children  because most children aren't brought up like that what just it was irrelevant what are you saying you 
[01:05:30]  muttering old fool he's gonna be a major distraction at school yeah they won't tease him i'm sure no  no not at all no kids don't uh not all that won't be fun funny for them no to look and see the  janitor with the stupid wig and the fake bosoms looking like looking like john lithgow from uh  garp garp i just wait until you're sweeping the floor and then go around the corner and throw a big  dildo on the floor yeah like a lifelike one and hey you drop this yeah that's exactly what the 
[01:06:00]  kids are gonna be doing gonna make his life a living hell yeah so uh signs they'll draw little  things on the walls in the locker room can he go in the girls locker now or does he have to go in  the boys locker where's he go i i don't know jimmy which one's he allowed in i i don't know  it's in oxford uh massachusetts so you ever have one of these things in school or in your in your town  or any of that i've seen them but i mean again we're older i'm being 40 it's it's you know you 
[01:06:30]  didn't see as many in the 70s or early 80s it's not as acceptable then as it is now god he's terrible  i just got a better look what look at look at he has man forearms i'm painting a brianna and i'm  painting with a mullet you gotta soften out your body right he's awful you gotta get rid of the the  shoulders the big man shoulders that's the first thing you gotta try to do his shirt's all tucked 
[01:07:00]  in like a guy yeah yeah his dumb man's belt and jeans oh god look at that shot on his knees get  these shots on onaradio.com they're going up now stunt brain all right good some kind of painting and  and it just looks like meatloaf from uh fight club is his last name really bonin yeah  and he has a man shorts like there's almost down to your knees shorts and kneeling and he's painting 
[01:07:30]  a wall and you can see he has like a bit of a gut and his breast yeah fake breasts just looks  ridiculous it's not offensive it's just silly why would you do that great karnak bonin bonin  what he won't be doing anymore yeah that's good stuff bonin is this uh supposed to make you  ever boni uh sorry yeah hold on 
[01:08:00]  isn't this supposed to make your life better uh yeah i think it is you're supposed to uh to  fulfilling your lifelong dream of uh uh becoming a woman because you've been a man um or a woman  trapped in a man's body yeah let's go to jared and that woman's fighting to get out through the  gut jared hey guys are you gonna go they're gonna give me a 54 year old hatchet own to match  yeah that's what they should do is give him an old one to match uh how old he is oh that's a good 
[01:08:30]  idea one that's just been you know ravaged poor son has to deal with this i don't care what you say  it's embarrassing of course it is dad he wants to be a girl go around painting the school up  just like a lady why don't you stop it it's bad enough that you got to tell everyone that your  dad's a janitor at the school seriously and now you have to say well my dad's now a chick janitor  uh mike no let's go to john in jersey john hey what's happening hey 
[01:09:00]  uh i'm growing up man we had this guy he was a mailman his name was jerry and like a couple  months went by next thing you know we've seen him dressing up in girls mailman clothes and stuff  we call him gerald g gerald dean gerald dean had the sex change and everything and me and my mom  were at the shop right one day i mean this person looked like a woman from behind with a with a wig  my mom's like yeah by chance this coffee you know was on sale and he he she turned around 
[01:09:30]  and says no i'm not quite sure i've been devastated ever since i don't know what to go what to think of  that stuff yeah i don't know man i mean it brings a lot of attention to you yeah a lot of pointing  and laughing and chuckling when you're that young man when you're that young you see something like  that and it sounds like a guy i don't know kids in school that's kind of scary i think this is you  got to leave this to the young like i think aunt was saying you get up into middle age it's not the 
[01:10:00]  best time to do that you do you pass the opportunity right you know the opportunity is when you're in  your uh 20s i think if you want to be a broad regular that's when you can gussy yourself up  regular girls look awful when they hit their 50s and now you're going to be a guy and decide to be a  50 some odd year old woman i think that you should have to get 10 other people to agree that other that  you could look like a woman like there's nothing like there are certain people like uh asians 
[01:10:30]  typically are the most passable because they're not hairy they're very they're not asian guys not  hairy so when they become like a lot of times you'd be like oh that's a that's a guy or uh  will you yeah i'm saying that we won't look we've watched as much porn as i have some other  some stuff falls to the crust um but it's it's always people who are younger it's never older  people who look past yeah and you should just not be able to do that to your family i don't know how  that i just don't know how that makes your life better maybe we could have a serious discussion  about this if we got some people out there that know but how does that make your life better 
[01:11:00]  you're already confused inside but as you walk around society no one knows that you're confused  inside and now all sudden you go for this thing and you're wearing old school dresses like i said and  weird old school hairdos and how does that make your life better now everyone's just pointing and  laughing at you well they knew his they knew there was something wrong with him because all  the paint brushes he would just angrily chop the handles off yeah get it guys yeah of course all  right as uh as travis screens the calls because now they're lit we'll get a few on the on the phone

[01:20:00]  Hmm likes uh bringing knives out threatening with knives  He said he equates sex with violence  Yeah  Very odd character that uh, Pat Duffy  Absolutely, but he gave us another great video  Certainly did  Opie and Anthony in the YouTube search  Latest videos, you'll see that  Mark, Boston, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey  You know, I was just wondering like  BCN, what's the deal with it?  You guys are like, you know, best friends with them  And they ain't playing your show?  What? 
[01:20:30]  I'm upset about that  You know, I'm like, you beat Santa on Friday  Oh  Well, it was a last minute thing  So maybe they just weren't prepared for us to go late  I don't know  I was, I was very upset  I'm sitting there, you know, listening to the show  Great show going down  And bam  They toss on some rock  I'm like, what?  You know, uh  We had to like pick, you know, really hot girls  From like a lot of girls  And we thought it was going to be a hack  Who gives a crap type of bit  It turned out to be really, really good  And it got even better  Because next thing you know 
[01:21:00]  Like E-Rock's getting punched in the gut  And there was other things happening with the girls  And they all had personality too  The girls were great  They were great, man  We really hated that we had to do that  Because we thought, oh my god  We can't get the girls naked or nothing  And this is going to suck  But it really turned out to be good  Yeah  It really turned out to be good  You just never know  Yeah  You know, right now  I'm going to cry  Because I missed all of that  Well, you got some good videos up online  Thanks, Mark  We got to move on  The Russian Broad's checking in  Russian Broad  Hey, Oakster 
[01:21:30]  What's up?  How are you?  So you were the one that was kicking Pat Duffy  In the old groin on Friday  Oh, yeah  Like he goes to me afterwards  He's like, actually, that was really fun  I would love to try that again  So we decided to maybe do that a few more times  Maybe later on  In a privacy of his own apartment  And you guys mentioned punching me in the boobies  And he did that as well  Didn't really feel like much, though  Wasn't that interesting  Well, one of the greatest stories ever told on our show  Was this Chuck Farnham 
[01:22:00]  Who lives in the San Francisco area  And he got into some weird stuff  And he met this girl that insisted that he punch her in the boob  Really, really hard  Until  And she wasn't satisfied until the boobs would get bruised up  And she would keep yelling at Chuck to punch harder and harder  And Chuck was so disturbed by it  But he still did it  So I kind of mentioned it on Friday  I never really understood it  I never really understood it  Because it's all fat  There's nothing there  It's not going to hurt  Well, it depends on what time of the month  You know, you girls get a little sore 
[01:22:30]  Did he slap you at all?  Did you guys have, like, really hardcore sex this week  For the weekend?  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  I reached my peak a few times  And I usually don't  I'm very hard to please in that area  And he definitely made me reach my height  All right, we got it  So were you guys doing anything crazy?  Like, there was, all right, the punching of the boob  What else?  We did the rough street trombone a few more times 
[01:23:00]  Nice  And we started talking about  We started talking about, like, how we became so freaky  And, you know, he told me he had some psychological issues when he was a kid  And then I realized that I knew it when I was, like, maybe five  And I used to live in Russia  In the city where I lived, St. Petersburg  They had a lot of cannibals in the city  From, like, World War II  What?  Yeah, yeah  Because all the roads were cut off 
[01:23:30]  But there would be no food during the war  Going into the city  Because it was all frozen over  So people really had to resort to eating each other  And some of these people, you know  They had kids  And their kids also got into the same stuff  Come on  Put that up there, stunt brain  Cannibalism in Russia  Look it up  I would believe it  Yeah  All right  So what does that have to do with you?  Well, it has to do with  Because I saw this special  Like, on the news when I was maybe five or six  About how there were a lot of cannibals in the city 
[01:24:00]  And I got really into it  I thought it was just the most amazing thing ever  And I think that was when I lost my innocence  When I realized that I thought cannibalism was awesome  So  What?  From there on it was just a downward spiral for me  Well, when was your first time, like, in bed  Something like hardcore like that  Like slapping or breast punching  I mean, that's like hardcore activity  When did that happen?  Or when did you try that?  Well, actually, I tried that very recently 
[01:24:30]  I never really liked violence in bed  I tried it maybe earlier on this year  And I didn't think I was going to like it  But I really, really got into it  So I guess, you know, when me and Pat met  At first I was being kind of  Like I was just toying with him  We didn't have sex for a while, actually  And then when we started to  I was like, you know, slap me  You know, hit me, all that stuff  And he was a little surprised by it 
[01:25:00]  But then afterwards he's like  Yeah, you know, finally someone  That understands what I want and like  So from there on it just went more violent  In the progression  Well, I got to ask Russian Broad  Do you feel threatened  When you're with Pat Duffy ever?  Do you feel what?  Do you feel like scared or  Do you feel like  Not at all  Okay  Not at all  You should  Yeah, I kind of noticed that  When they were hanging out on Friday  That she had not a fear  And there's a lot of people that fear of Pat Duffy  Because he doesn't seem quite right  Seems a little unstable  Yeah, he seems a lot of times  Well, he definitely is 
[01:25:30]  He's crazy, but I mean  And that doesn't bother you?  That doesn't scare you?  That he's crazy?  No, it doesn't bother me at all  And actually my mother also knows  What went on  Like she asked me what happened on the show  I was reluctant to tell her  But then she heard me listening to the replay  And then she's like  Oh my God  Oh my God  She never knew that I was this violent before  Yeah, we're going to recut the video  Because, you know, the face slapping and all that  At the beginning of the video  Who cares?  We've got to get right to the groin shot  Because it's unbelievable 
[01:26:00]  That's your money right there  It's really unbelievable how sick that is  But Rush Abroad  So the cannibalism thing, right?  You said you got into it  Now, about 10, 11 years ago  I got into sushi  So I started eating sushi  So what happens with the cannibalism?  If you got  Well, I never  I think I realized  That if I was presented the chance  To eat human flesh  I would  Oh my God  No, I realized in the recent years  That I really am much scarier 
[01:26:30]  Than I ever thought I would be  When I was growing up  Wonderful  We're not going to have you around anymore  Do you like regular porn?  Or do you need it to be hardcore?  Or can you enjoy regular stuff too?  Oh no, I prefer hardcore all the way  I don't mean hardcore  I mean like really like bizarre fetish type stuff  Oh no, no, no, no  I'm not into fetishes  I don't even like to watch it be that violent  I like group  I like Q1-1 
[01:27:00]  That I love  Really?  In what way?  Yeah  No, two guys and one girl  Oh, okay  So you like being put on the rotisserie  As they call it  Yeah  Of course  Really?  And I like just  You know, just nasty things  But I'm not into fetishes  Would you like to have two guys  And you be tied up  Or restrained  Or cuffed or whatever  And then have two guys?  I thought about it  And I think that yes  I'm not a big fan of the buck play 
[01:27:30]  But I think I would be a good little girl  And actually try it out  So with Pat Duffy  Are you guys searching out another dude?  No, we're not  We're not really thinking about that quite yet  Actively seeking  Another dude  Are you searching out another dude?  Pat's a cuckold  Hey, Stumper  What do we got on the cannibalism?  Yeah, this is  This is more than just World War II  Apparently it also started well earlier than that  And in 1920 to 21  They had a famine  Which caused some of the people in the Soviet Union 
[01:28:00]  To resort to eating human flesh  They said prisoners would break out of prison  And take along a weak inmate with them  As a food supply  Oh, that's wonderful  And there were parents killing children  And eating children  And so there's a history of this  In your rich culture  Now we know why the Russian attitude  Yeah  I had to eat people  Yeah  In my country we ate people  In Russia  Yakov Shmironov  What a country  What a country 
[01:28:30]  You don't eat each other  Shut up  Apparently the gulags were considered a food source as well  So some of the  It sounds like a tasty dish  Gulag  Oh, the Russian gulag  Gulag, gulag  There you go over there  Oh, I want some of that gulag  All right  Tasty  I'll get a side of armed robber, please  Oh, my grandfather was in one of those  He was sent to a mining camp by Stalin  And I can only wonder what happened there 
[01:29:00]  He's dead  Yeah, he never came back  I know, no, I know he's dead  But he actually developed cancer after that  From the radiation  Not very fun  No  Oh, I think also my freakiness  My freakiness might also come from the fact that  I used to live less than like 100 miles away from Chernobyl  And I'm surprised I didn't develop any sort of abnormalities  Yeah, I think you developed something  Hopefully it was great for like the Chernobyl caused hair loss  We're exactly what we needed  How perfect is that? 
[01:29:30]  I think it caused you to become very hungry all the time  Yeah  All right, Russian Broad  Thank you  No problem  Sure  Bye, guys  Bye  She's a star on YouTube today  Her and Pat Duffy  It's pretty impressive, the video  Sexy, very busty girl  Nice rump  And a good right leg  Not a hit of fear  She wasn't acting on Friday  No  She doesn't fear  Pat Duffy  Wasn't feeling that whole ass thing that she was showing 
[01:30:00]  What was she doing?  I forgot  She showed her ass  Oh, yeah  I like that  It's a spankable one  It looked a little  Nice boobies, though  But the ass  For somebody who's, you know  Supposedly, how old is she?  She's 21, 27  Yeah  I mean, you shouldn't have the old  Been sitting in the gravel driveway  And, you know, stood up and brushed it off look  That's all I'm saying  A couple little dimples are okay  You know, a little  Couple  A little thick  A little spankable  I don't know  It's nice 
[01:30:30]  You put a good handprint in that  Laugh about it later  Look at the butt Danny found  Yeah, that was similar  Yeah  No, come on  How are you killing the broad?

[01:31:30]  What?  Christine Jorgensen was like the first real transsexual  I believe  Opie and Anthony, by the way  Quite groundbreaking  Well, the show continues during the breaks  Unfortunately, we gotta squeeze some commercials in there  So you don't get to hear the stuff we do during the breaks  But we still talk  We talk about trannies  Trannies and stuff  And we  I mean, my memory goes back to Dr. Richards  Dr. Richards 
[01:32:00]  Renee Richards  Right  The first  In my world  The first high-profile  Thing  I just remember the other one  The only reason I say thing  Because they're trannies  They're transsexuals  They're  Yeah, what are they?  I get all confused  Transgender  Trans  I just call them things  The first thing that I  I remember  Was this Dr. Richards  Who was a tennis player  And then decided to get the operation  And then  He continued playing tennis against the females  With his big, huge, manly biceps 
[01:32:30]  How did he do?  He looked like Frankenstein out there  He didn't do too well, right?  No  I don't throw you off  It's like cutting off a Tyrannosaurus's tail  Your balance is all off  I think all the  I think all the crying got in the way  I don't know  But it was a horror show  Because I think back then  This is what we were saying during the break  Like  They didn't have it all figured out  So they  Nah  They pumped some hormones in you  They did a little 
[01:33:00]  Something with your body  And said  I don't know  Try this  See if this changes how you feel  You know they didn't have those  Microsurgery techniques  That they have now  To keep all the nerves intact  And  How they do it  Where they  Actually take the male  Part  And turn it inside out  Yeah  To craft a female part  Mm-hmm  But  They probably didn't have that figured out  No, not back then  Like, alright  What do we do after we just cut things off here?  How do we  How do we fix this? 
[01:33:30]  And who was the one you were talking about?  Christine Jorgensen  Was  Is that Christine Jorgensen?  That's a  That's a man's nose  That's a guy  Looking like  Some kind of  30's broad  Oh, she was  Way back  She was old school?  I don't know how old school  When did Christine Jorgensen  Have the operation  Their stunt brain?  It's like 50 or 52  Who the hell is she?  And this is a  Former World War II GI  Ah, that's nice  Who the joke was  She went abroad  And came back abroad  I get it 
[01:34:00]  Yay, whoa  Wah, wah  Didn't she have to go to  Like  Den  Sweden  Sweden  Yeah, somewhere to get that surgery done  Yeah  And came back  A lovely woman  Was she in Hollywood or something?  She has like Hollywood pictures  Hmm  She has like those old school Hollywood pictures  I know he, she, whatever  Was very famous at the time  For being like  Hey, it's the first guy  That got his thing  You know  This is literally the first one?  Pretty sure  Pretty sure  Len Marquise 
[01:34:30]  Jesus  Very high profile  Very high profile back  In the day  52  Let's go to Chris  Chris, you're on Opie and Anthony  Christian  Hey, Christian  What's up?  Whatever  How you going up, y'all?  Didn't know if it was me  That's all  Huge fan  Little Jimmy  Happy birthday  Thank you, sir  And I don't know if you remember  But I'm the unprepared douchebag  That you met outside of the PNC  Non-traveling virus store  As you are for this call  Scott in New York  What's up?  You took way too long, buddy  It's a great show 
[01:35:00]  Thank you, Scott  That Dr. Renee Richards  Yeah  She, he  Is a really well-known  Jim  She's a really well-known eye doctor, though  I mean  Really?  She's done magazines  Not that well-known  Has she ever looked in the mirror before?  Oh, my God  I mean, yeah  My son actually had a eye problem  We actually got referred to him  And to sit there in the office  And, you know  Just look at it  It's not pretty  Where does she practice? 
[01:35:30]  Why am I saying she?  We're in New York City somewhere  I'm in New York  Really?  Yeah  Yeah  All right, guys  I gotta go  All right, thank you  All right  Let's go to Michael in Georgia  Michael  Yeah, man  How's the war going?  Pretty good  All right, good  The trucking company that I used to work for  Had a guy  His wife wanted to be a lesbian  So he had a sex change for her  And then she decided after a fact  That she wanted to go with a man  So she left him for a man 
[01:36:00]  Well, probably because he looked so silly  Yeah, he looked really, really ridiculous  He was a real manly type man  And then he'd become a really ugly woman  And he committed suicide after that  She probably wanted to go with a lesbian  Like, but a hot one  Like, you know, maybe  Even Ellen's not bad looking for  You know, an old girl  In a mullet and pantsuit  How could you say that?  Ellen's not an ugly woman  She's just  Well  She's  Yeah, she's not ugly, I guess  But as a guy 
[01:36:30]  You wouldn't even  You wouldn't even think of  Like  No, not even a second glance  Not even as  Right  Well, because you know  You think that's why?  Yeah, you know  She wouldn't be  And she dresses so  Just, let's be honest  Terribly  She's a terrible dresser  Even if she dressed nice  And she was in a  Place, whatever  You'd  You'd kind of  Make a move there  She doesn't have an ugly face  Or she's not fat  I mean, she probably has a nice little rump on her  They've got to come up with lesbian wear  She doesn't look like  She's got a nice rump on her  I'll tell you that  It's called men's clothes  That's what I mean, though  They'd screw the men's clothes  And come up with a new thing 
[01:37:00]  Lesbian wear  Whatever that would be  Yeah  Like a sweater vest  Because Ellen dresses like  Kind of like a gay guy  Yeah, she has terrible taste  She dresses like a white guy  Who doesn't really know how to dress  But who kind of wants to look younger  She wants to be the guy  And she is in the relationship  With Portia De Rossi  They got married  And Portia was wearing the wedding gown  And Ellen was wearing the suit  Yeah  Yeah  A little white suit  I would think she would wear something  A little different for a man  She looks like she should be 
[01:37:30]  Like in an emo band  Yeah  Or  I don't know  Look  They've got to come up with lesbian wear  Yeah, stop dressing like men  Let's say hi to Mike  Hey, Mike  Mike  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  So, I used to do Rocky Horror  Back in the day  I heard Jimmy talk about it before  And one of these pre-op trannies  Used to come to the show all the time  And hit on me  All the time  Would the pre-op tranny dress like Frankenfurter? 
[01:38:00]  No, no, no  She didn't  But she literally looked like  John Lithgow with glasses  Hmm  Hot  From Garp  I mean, dressed like him and everything  I mean, scary  With a Georgia accent  It was  I still get nightmares about it  He's trying  I know  I went to the Rocky Horror Show  We've heard it all, sir  You've really got to  You know  A couple times when I was like 13  Yeah  And I remember one time  Some teenagers  Hit me in the face with an egg 
[01:38:30]  Right in my glasses  Aww  Because the Rocky Horror Show  Is kind of a fun experience  And people bring eggs  They're not supposed to  But they like hollow out the bread  And then put eggs in them  Right  And I got an egg whipped  Right in my  Right in my fat little face  Well, they've come up with so many fun  Cute little things to do  At the midnight showings  Yeah  Is there still one in the city?  Like if there's rain  If there's rain  They'll all hold up umbrellas  And like little squirt guns  And squirt guns  And then they'll throw a toast  And they say, you know 
[01:39:00]  A toast  A toast  And they'll throw a toast  I've never gone to one of these  And oh  I'm proud to say  It's not bad  I went to one  Yeah?  And?  Yeah  Was it fun?  It was kind of funny  You know  Was it fun hanging with nerds?  I just didn't like  I don't like getting involved with anything  So I don't like anyone involving me  But I'll watch  You know  It's kind of  It was kind of lame  I mean some of these people  It was their entire lives  They must just spend putting costumes together  And going every night  And it was kind of  There are people that have seen it like 400 times 
[01:39:30]  There's got to be a midnight show in New York somewhere  Yeah  There has to be  On a Friday night sometime  Why don't we all go?  We should want time  Yeah  Bring your toast  No  Why not?  Give us something to talk about on Monday  Sex with Hooker  Wasn't fun  It was work  Says Cop  Oh  Who's believing this guy?  Says Tommy  Who's believing this guy?  You know  We could talk about jobs that aren't fun  This sounds like it would be kind of a fun job  Sure  Did he get a male escort?  Like I could see that was true 
[01:40:00]  The cop was just doing his duty  If he was straight  And he let a gay diesel male escort  Rail him  Just to bust the guy  That's a guy  All right  You're busted  Then we would believe his story  But in this case  Write up the report  A suspended Texas police officer  Testified Thursday  That he was forced  To have sex  With two prostitutes  During an undercover  Sting operation  Saying he was paid to do it  Hmm  Officer Keith Breener  Oh  Scared me  That was the first name  Breener  Oh no kidding  Testified in Texas 
[01:40:30]  During a hearing  To be reinstated  After he was suspended  Along with another officer  After it came to light  That the men  Engaged in sex acts  With prostitutes  While on the job  Hmm  This is like a  Storyline right out of The Wire  Yep  What's his name in The Wire  Had this happen to him  Yep  Speaking of The Wire  Snoop  Yeah she got busted  Jimmy and I were talking about this  Over the weekend  You didn't watch The Wire  No  Snoop was this  Barely looked like a female  Yeah  One of the scariest  Oh right  I remember you talking about Snoop  One of the scariest characters  On The Wire 
[01:41:00]  And what did Stephen King call her  She was like the  I think the scariest  Female villain ever on television  Wow  She was so realistic  Because you know  She was a real gangbanger  Yeah well  The cops came a knocking  Because they want her  Because she was a witness  To a murder  And this Snoop  When she was 14  She killed somebody  And spent four years  In the joint  And now she was this  Big star on The Wire  Which is just an amazing  Turn around  Yeah  They went to her house  Because they want her  To testify on another  Like a murder  That she had nothing to do with  She just witnessed  Yeah  And what did they find 
[01:41:30]  Pot in her house  Or something  A little bit of poops  So she's in a bit of trouble  A little violation  This morning  Yeah  She saw a stabbing  Outside a chicken joint  In Baltimore  Yeah  The real deal  She's the real deal  Absolutely  You know how violent  And outside the chicken joint  Stabbing must be  In Baltimore  Wow  Do you know what an unpleasant  Event that is to be involved in  It's not just a quick little poke  And oh I'm sorry  I remember when I was working  At Pergament years ago  I was probably 19  Pergament?  It was a bunch of black dudes 
[01:42:00]  And me that worked  In the receiving area  In the shipping area  And we would  A lot of times  I'd go to New Brunswick  This guy  I think his nickname was Hook  He was a bald dude  And he was like loud  And we were in some chicken place  On George Street  In New Brunswick  It's in the middle of the afternoon  And of course  He gets into an altercation  With the guy  Because the guy  Didn't give enough chicken  And he just starts  Screaming back in  At the guy  And you better have a pistol  And I'm like  Why am I here?  Wow  I just want to go back  To Pergament  And eat my chicken  Oh that's bad  This is kind of ugly 
[01:42:30]  She's not threatening  With guns  How does an extra  Drumstick  Like related to it  Like you better have  A pistol  And he meant it  Now you're just involved  Like oh  I just want my dumb chicken  And go back to my awful job  But I wasn't even involved  I was so obviously  Just the guy  That drove him from work  Right  I didn't say anything  I just held the chicken for him  And like held the ketchup thing up  So it didn't spill out  Of the little thing  Because then he might have hurt me  What does Pergament sell?  I don't even know  They sold  Rubs?  I think they're gone now  Aren't they?  Probably  It was like a Home Depot type place 
[01:43:00]  Well Home Depot  Pretty much put them under  Did they?  Yeah  Pergament  Was Pergament Paints  I don't remember  And you go in there  There's lighting fixtures  It was always the place  That your parents took you  That was just the most boring place  As a kid to walk into  Aside from when mom  Took you shopping  I used to like to go  To the local lumber yard  Yeah they used to have  The local lumber yard  Before that  That Home Depot  You know  Took out the little man  I hate when the little man  Is taken out  Hate it  Yeah  But yeah  Shopping at Pergament  Was just so dull 
[01:43:30]  It's like  Hey come on  We're gonna need  Some light fixtures  And as a kid  Light fixtures  Try working there  Try working there  Yeah that must have sucked  I worked there when I was drinking  Did you work at the paint can shaker  Look I need a raise  No thank you  Thank you very much  I used to  I worked at the one  In the Brunswick shopping mall  In North Brunswick  And then I was drinking  And doing drugs and stuff  And then I got sober  And they moved to a bigger facility  And I called in sick  My third day  My psychology was 
[01:44:00]  I just got hired here  No one would call in sick  The third day  Unless they were really sick  Really sick  Yeah  And you were really fired  No I didn't get fired  Oh  But they were not happy  Of course not  The fact that I called in sick  But they had no one else to hire  That'll go on your permanent record  Yeah  Yeah  Want to get back  Slacker  Let's get back to this cop  So he had sex with a couple hookers  And he said it wasn't fun  It was work  If you're asking if I had an orgasm  Yes  It was a job sir 
[01:44:30]  Bringing a report  That he said  During testimony  That's it  I didn't have pleasure doing this  I was paid to do it  He's such a liar  They do have to report  Whenever they fire their gun  I know that  There it is  End of competition for today  Yeah  Very funny  Yeah that's very good  Breener admitted to being manually  Can we say this crap  It's a news story  I think  I think you could stop right there  I know exactly what you're going to say  Okay  Admitted to being manually blank  As well as engaging in blank 
[01:45:00]  And blank sex  Whoa  Wow  With two women at two spas  During an undercover sting operation  Police Chief Frank  How did this guy get caught?  Police Chief Frank Coffin contends that  Breener and fellow officer David Kiker  K-I-K-E-R too  Were suspended indefinitely after the sex acts came to light  The paper said  Breener is trying to stop Texas from suspending him  Saying that he was asked to have sex as part of the job  Yeah  Is that true?  Are some of these cops having  I don't think you could ask an officer to have sexual intercourse with a hooker 
[01:45:30]  And have him do it  And everything's hunky-dory  He thought he could get away with one  Yeah  He probably, you know, thought  You're in that situation  And, uh  You know, it's right there  You're ready to roll  Hmm  I don't know  It's a tricky situation for a cop  A lot of discipline  Why confess it?  Why would you  Unless it's on tape  And they had  He probably got caught  And then, you know, fessed up  Well, how do you get caught once it's done?  I mean, what do you not 
[01:46:00]  You wash up, it's finished  Hmm  I don't know  Maybe you gotta account for  Why you went in there?  What happened?  What'd you do?  What that is on your shirt?  Yeah  On your shoes?  On your hand and weapon?  And belt?  It was a good one  Wow  She ruled  You ever have sex with your pants on?  Like, your jeans or black pants  And, like, you don't take your pants off  You just open the fly  And then afterwards, you're like  Oh my god, what happened to the front of my pants?  This is a disaster  What's in there?

[02:01:00]  How these local news stations  Made us so scared  Of big tropical storm space  And here in Pensacola  Yesterday was probably  The most beautiful day  Of the year  You got the libraries  Are closed  Everything's closed  You got around the clock  News coverage  It was so sunny and beautiful  They kept going back  To showing like  Central Florida flooding  And like for three days  We were on the morning  And don't go out  We're gonna get  10 inches of rain  There's gonna be  55 mile an hour winds  And yesterday I went  For a beautiful  Mile and a half walk  With my kids  In 75 degree sunny weather 
[02:01:30]  Yeah  It was sunny blue skies  And they're still trying  The fear tactics  Awesome day of the year  Yeah  It was great  And we're like  Three days of warnings  And driving humidity  They decided to leave  Florida alone finally  After  What were you  You described it perfectly  On Friday  The hurricane  Or whatever it was  Tropical storm  After a while  Started becoming  One of those little  Balls on the paddle  With the elastic string  It just wouldn't  It wouldn't leave them alone  No  More importantly  So you said  The libraries were closed  Let's get to the bottom  Of that 
[02:02:00]  Who's really even  Going to the library anymore  Who goes there  I took my kids  To the library  Not to interrupt you sir  But I thought  When I said  Who's going to the library anymore  I looked across the room  And it looked like  Stunt brain  Mouthed  Could I  What did he say  No he doesn't  To the library  I like to peruse  The microfilm  What do you do  Besides  Maybe you know  Wear like  Tight sweatpants  Hang on the children's section  No I go  I go almost every week  For what  For what  You can  I don't have a lot  Of magazine subscriptions 
[02:02:30]  And you can get  Tons of magazine subscriptions  You get every magazine  You can get  It's called  The computer  You can get  Any information online  That you can get  Anywhere in the library  I don't understand  He's old school  What do you do  I do  People  No I read  I read a lot of  You know  Financial magazines  Car mags  When I'm home  Reading the  Encyclopedia Britannica  But you know  It's comfortable  It's free  My time life books  And I'm cheap  Are you a chesler  Yeah I am  But you can also get  All the new books 
[02:03:00]  When they come out  Right at the library too  And it's a great place  To meet the ladies  I got Jimmy's book  At the library  By the way  Did you really  Not in Mississippi  And certainly  The Jackson system  Isn't  They banned  It's a reference book  Why would you think  They would allow that book  Why wouldn't they  They have books  They have Mein Kampf  Pile it up and burn it  They like that one  Oh man  Thank you Ronnie  Hey we didn't mention  We meant to last week  But we had too much material  That guy who listed you  As a hero 
[02:03:30]  That's in a bit of trouble  Yeah we don't have that  I mean it was a guy  He was in Pennsylvania  We had it last week  But he did some horrific crime  And then they checked out  His MySpace  Because that's what they do now  Yeah  You do something wrong  And they used to go  To your yearbook  Now they go to your MySpace  All they had was  Your yearbook photo  Now yeah they got  Your whole MySpace page  Profile everything  He kidnapped  Apparently kidnapped  And raped  Or allegedly raped  A 14 year old girl  That's what they're  Just a horrible  Horrible crime  And they checked out  His MySpace 
[02:04:00]  And in his favorite section  Or Heroes  Heroes  It had all these  He's got it right there  All these rapists  Oh here  See we had it from last week  Excerpts from Derek  Whatever his last name is  MySpace page  Heroes  This is his Heroes  Child molesters  And deadbeat dads  I mean really  How much of a stripper  And prostitute shortage  Would there be  Without these guys  And then right after that  His next hero  Is Jim Norton  Comedian  Wow  And then right after that  Is Scott Peterson  Edmund Kemper  Mary Bell 
[02:04:30]  I don't know Mary Bell  Carl  Hansram  You don't know  Lawrence Bitteker  Lawrence  Oh he was a brutal one  A bad boy  What did Lawrence do  Lawrence Bitteker  From what I know  Was with  He was released for something  And him and another convict  Tortured a couple of girls  With like pliers and stuff  In a van for a couple of days  And I think there's actually  Audio of it that the FBI had  Wow  It's a bad guy  What about Roy Norris  Don't know Roy Norris  What about  Well Ted Bundy of course  Oh he was a naughty one 
[02:05:00]  How about Robert Hansen  I don't know  Hopefully  Cute little one  In parentheses  It says all infamous killers  That's the media  The media put comedian  And all infamous killers  He didn't have that on his page  Oh okay  To name just a few  But Jim Norton  Made this guy's heroes list  Alright  Grats  Edmund Kemper too  Yeah  The co-ed killer  From California  Big six foot  Six foot six monster  The naughty boy  Yeah  There's a great story  Robert Ressler told  He was like one of the FBI  Pioneering profilers 
[02:05:30]  About being in a cell  With Kemper  Interviewing him  And then Kemper said  Something like  You know  What's to prevent me  Right now  From just killing you  Because he's six six  He's a big boy  Oh  And he's like  I'd be a hero in here  If I killed an FBI agent  And Ressler kind of  Was like  Well you think  I'd come in here  Without my weapon  And uh  I should have known  Weapons aren't allowed  He's like  Let me see it  And he's like  I'm not going to show it to you  But he psyched him out  He psyched out the guy  Wow  Yeah  And then the guy's like  You know I was just kidding right 
[02:06:00]  But he said it was really scary  Yeah  I'm only joking  In April 1973  Kemper  Kemper battered his mother to death  With a pick hammer  While she slept  He used her decapitated head  That's right  For uh  Blank sex  Before using it  As a dart board  He also cut out her vocal cords  And put them in the garbage disposal  Wow  But the machine  Could not break the tough tissue down  And regurgitate it back into the sink  That seemed appropriate  He said after his arrest  As much as she  Bitched and screamed 
[02:06:30]  And yelled at me  Over so many years  You know it's funny  I read Kemper's account  Of what he did  And he  There's one account  Where he was talking  About what he did  He killed his mother  Uh  And he killed her friend  And uh  He said that he humiliated  His mother's corpse  Oh  Humiliated it  That's  But that's why  Obviously cutting the head off  And then getting some kind of sex  Yeah  It's awful  Wow  And this guy knows  Who uh  Robert Hanson is  Joe Jersey  What's up  What's going on guys  Hey man  Hey  Happy birthday Jimmy  Thank you mister  Yeah 
[02:07:00]  Well Robert Hanson  He was like a serial killer  Up in Alaska  And what he would do  Is he would like  Capture prostitutes  And then he would  Release them into the wild  And then hunt them down  No way  Oh my  That's exactly what he would do  How much  How much  Head start would he give him  I don't know  Um  I have a book about it  But I forgot what it was  Exactly  And how much land  Did he own  I don't think  I don't think it was land  That he owned  He just was out  Wilderness or whatever  Yeah  Yeah  It'd be kind of weird  If it was uh  Land of his own 
[02:07:30]  You know  That is creepy huh  Yeah  Did any get away bro  Uh no  They eventually caught him  No no no  Did any of the prostitutes  Actually get away  Um  I don't know  Probably would release him  Without shoes  And you know  I'm sure he wasn't  It wasn't a fair fight  Probably not a winter coat  To be had  Yeah  Or just  One hat but it's orange  And it makes a noise  Beeps  And they're just  You know  Screaming  Trying to get away 
[02:08:00]  Cold feet  In the Alaskan  That's terrible  It's nice  Alright we're gonna try  To find out more  On Robert Hanson  Alright later guys  Thank you  No one cares about  Prostitutes it seems  Like they're really  Fair game  For just  Sick guys  That uh  Want to do  Horrid things  Well they're expected  To be missing too  It's like they're not  Gonna look for them  Right away  Yeah yeah  Nobody really goes  To the cops right away  And reports them missing  And then when they do  They go  Oh yeah  She was a hooker  Who knows  She could run off  To another city  Or  You know  But uh 
[02:08:30]  Yeah they're fair game  Wow  He would then  Oh here it is  He began killing  Prostitutes around 1980  He would pay them  Have sex and everything  And then he would  Kidnap and rape them  And uh  He'd fly them  Actually out to his cabin  So it was his cabin  Uh  In his private plane  And then he would  Stalk and kill them  With a hunting knife  And a  Do you know what  A .223 caliber rifle is?  Uh yes  I own one  Oh it's a ruger  I should have known  Probably for the same purposes  Um  After  He would release them  Into his basement  And then his small 
[02:09:00]  Long Island yard  And shoot them  In his cold jacuzzi  They would hop in the pool  And freeze to death  Not anymore my friend  Oh did you fix it?  You're cordially invited  Over to the  Probably the hottest jacuzzi  On the face of the earth  It pumps lava out of it  I may go this weekend  Okay  I mean for the entire weekend  Just me alone  Just to see  If you're trying to get late  I'll just keep popping up  And talking show stuff  Dude  You gotta do  Tell her about the time  You did the voice 
[02:09:30]  Alright shut up  Turn the heat off  So he leaves  Oh okay  There was uh  I guess on June of 83  Which is three years  After he started  This one hooker  Went to the police  And identified Hanson  As the guy who had  Raped and kidnapped her  Uh  I'm not sure if it's uh  If she got away  I'm gonna say that  She must have gotten away  Why don't we know more  About this guy  Like he  When you talk  He was a hack  When you talk serial killers  His name doesn't come up  That often  But wow  This is a  This is a pretty  Pretty good one  Yeah  Maybe he didn't  With the private plane 
[02:10:00]  And you know  And hunting him  Yeah  Could you go down a little  Danny  I wanna see how many people  He killed  Maybe he didn't kill  Enough people  Ah true  Yeah turn over  His baseball card  What's the stats  In his rookie year  He did 15  That's not bad  15  In three years  That's not bad  Wow  Five wins a year  It's better than  Carl Pavano  Carl Pavano joke  In the middle of this  Nice  Uh  Oh star brain  Has some facts  I hate to take  The wikipedia down  But uh  Bob eventually 
[02:10:30]  Confessed to  17 killings  Which he referred to  As his  Summertime project  Hmm  And he uh  Turned over a map  To the authorities  Of where he had  Buried all the people  I love the serial killers  That are just so sick  They're like  I'm not gonna tell you  Where they are  Yeah  Nah  Not gonna tell you  Sorry  He said he hopes  To eventually  Become a writer  And write his own story  Aw  That's cool  That's very nice  That's a nice goal  He profits well off of it  A lot of times  Serial killers will use  Like the bodies  Where they're hidden  To avoid the death penalty  Or to try to get something 
[02:11:00]  They'll kind of  Dangle that  Yeah  And they'll tease that  For years  For years  It's like  I might give it to you  If you  You know  Give me immunity  From the death penalty  Alright well  Alright then  I'm not gonna tell you  Where the hundred bodies are  And then there's some  That won't  Because I think  Certain ones  They just don't want  To confess to  For whatever reason  Well  Don't touch that  That's part of the psychological  That's part of the psychological thing  And their heads  They're just sick  Yeah  Hey a quick story  Before we get out of here  Listen to this  Some sexiness  Why do you think we're playing that?

[02:24:30]  the family would disown me jimmy jimmy jimmy norton is on the list somewhere ice cubes for the jacuzzi  you won't let that jacuzzi thing go i have got it so blazing hot now i finally figured it out  and it gets ridiculous hot where you could cook in that fucking can i ask you uh uh jimmy something  though so that his uh jacuzzi was a little cold jimmy freezing really yeah it wasn't freezing it 
[02:25:00]  just wasn't hot why wouldn't you make sure the jacuzzi's ready to go if you're having this big  uh shindig over at your pad picture it like xm when you put a mic out or cbs even when you put a  mic out yeah because we're having a guest and they walk up to it and the mic doesn't work yeah true  that's exactly what it was like why would it be hot why would it be why exactly and then later on  you figure it out when it's too late yeah that's all right i mean now but you might have it too hot 
[02:25:30]  there's got to be a way uh to balance it so it's warm and it's hot and yet not uncomfortable well  the trick is to not have because i got a little waterfall and it spills out of the jacuzzi into  the pool the trick is to turn that off so you're not uh circulating the hot water into the pool it  stays in the jacuzzi now uh there was a point where i was trying to figure this out i had the waterfall  on and big kev came into the um the hot tub the night of the party actually into the hot tub yes  actually into the uh hot tub he's trying to rub his feet on my bag it's creepy 
[02:26:00]  took on my bag with his big toes but i'm i i'm noticing that the uh level of the hot tub  is going up up up now i'm not saying when he got in this happened but after a while i'm noticing it  got to the point where the water is now bubbling over the top of the jacuzzi so look around go what  the fuck is going on big kev it seems had leaned uh against the opening that the waterfall comes out 
[02:26:30]  of and completely blocked the waterfall it's the same reason he's blocked from going to niagara new york  they asked him never to return oh jesus  so yeah so he uh moved and it looked like a log flume ride coming out of the uh god out of the  jacuzzi that was a nice that was a nice that was a fun party though man yes great night just uh yes  oh you know i'll have uh uh uh more and and the jacuzzi's fixed i look forward to coming back over 
[02:27:00]  you'll like yeah but i i will uh appreciate if you don't urinate in the jacuzzi did you oh here's  40 times perhaps he's the water relaxing like crazy and i would just be talking all of a sudden  i'm like and it would just trickle out my it was so wonderful it was like being in the womb  thank god it circulates the water circulates so fast right everyone makes a tinkle in there  we're kidding let's all open up here the worst is a hot jacuzzi though you gotta grab your cock  and then slowly fucking steep your bag in there a little bit because that's exactly what happened 
[02:27:30]  last night i could not fucking get to the point where i could get my bag into the fucking pool it  was into the jacuzzi it was that hot really how to cool it down that's awesome crazy i'd like to  i like to look like a lobster when i get out oh yeah just cooked just i want to have some sexual  interaction in a jacuzzi i know i had that well i'd love some sexual interaction find someone else's  jacuzzi gonna be cleaning out that filter oh it needs to backwash you backwash and just slime 
[02:28:00]  comes out fucking comes easy yeah it'll look like the fucking pond and pot white pond scum  washes off god what else what else does anthony like oh my god i like uh where are we at so far  the show yeah my fam your family of course your house i guess my house i like that my my my cars  very materialistic anthony likes cars cars and pussy guns my guns yes love my guns 
[02:28:30]  my brand new colt okay oh it's great and uh i guess um i guess that's it that's it i don't have  animals which is good because they rip up everything else i've mentioned on the list  yep and uh animals are faggots you gotta get baby turtles why because uh they stink somebody 
[02:29:00]  from the philly crew has baby turtles that they rock don't they smell they rock you get them in  the salt water i think they're salt water big tank and they rock around yeah what could they possibly  do that's fun they swim their asses off like a sea monkey and they bother any any fish you buy  really can you pick them up and hold them or fucking if you yell hey come here to the turtle  come here it's just just rocking and rolling in the freaking uh whatnot i'm gonna go get some fish  i decided fish yeah too much work they die i'll get somebody to do all that you can't get the 
[02:29:30]  the gunk you can't get let the fish get the gunk or the fin rot oh my fish has fin rot it was the  ick or the ick oh my fish has the ick guppies used to get ick and fin rot because i didn't take  care of the tank too much algae i didn't scrape it with that razor blade thing and my dad like uh  wouldn't clean the fish tank properly and we'd have guppies galore and we'd be excited we'd come  running down every morning see the baby guppies and the little the little baby tank that's inside 
[02:30:00]  the big tank and and then when they get big enough they go into the big tank all right the baby tank i  remember those and then the ick would take over and everything would die within two days  from the ick how often do you got to change like if we want to get like a really big salt every hour  that's not bad i actually thought it was every three minutes  it's very hard to sleep you gotta keep waking up i'm getting the tank and re-salting salt water um  tanks are very difficult yeah i think very difficult to maintain how do you do it you just 
[02:30:30]  figure it out how do you get salt in there but i think that's just it is it table salt regular  salt no i think it's some kind of um special exotic salt is it i think so you gotta buy it at  the pet store when i put a fish tank in my dumb apartment you just go down the local beach and get  a few uh few gallons a few gallons of salt water and just throw it in there and then temperature  is like crazy you gotta keep up on the temperature with those tropical saltwater fish for fish that  are used to living in nature they are very pain in the ass to take in your house very particular man 
[02:31:00]  i had a fish die when i had it i took it out and put on the sofa and watch television  no you didn't we did we watch we watch the worm channel  the worm channel  i mean my fish died i walked them  so and your uh what you like list is complete right we were we were um we were transferring some  fish uh from a one tank uh into a temporary tank while we cleaned the uh fish tank sure and uh dawn's 
[02:31:30]  little angel fish she had an angel fish of course because it's little dawn impossible to keep alive  angel fish well we tried well this was a good idea taking it from one tank which was in the living room  uh in through the kitchen where the other tank was in one of the sinks so you know fill it up and stuff  and uh in the other sink was scalding water where plates uh were soaking  come on guess where the angel fish jumped out of the little net 
[02:32:00]  oopsie right over the scalding water and dawn's like get it quick is it okay  it was it was a black angel fish it was white when it came out of the water and totally dead  it had cooked it had cooked a little bit yes oh hello damn it oh that oh  thank you oh okay yes how did i miss it let's say hi to john and i don't have a mouse so i  can't say hi to anyone where's the other mousy oh is that uh this one oh phone you i want to get 
[02:32:30]  my fucking stitches out of my nose i want them out too oops stitches in my nose uh john in rochester  john what's up hey a saltwater tank is the hardest part about it is setting it up it's actually pretty  easy to maintain it maintains itself it's just when you first set one up it takes like four weeks  before you can even put a fish in because it's got a game of bacteria and all that wait four weeks 
[02:33:00]  really well it has to get those levels up what is that the uh the p uh the ph the ph levels have  to be perfect and you have to do it's a ph level it's a nitrous and anoxic level it's a acid level  it's like everything has to be fuck that because we tried this when we were growing up we went from  like just raising guppies and we're like we're ready for the saltwater tank oh no they don't tell  you that all of a sudden you have to be a chemist yeah all of a sudden you have to be like a junior 
[02:33:30]  chemist to figure it out every day it's a nightmare if you're going to get a saltwater tank you got to  get someone that comes in like a like a maid or something once every couple weeks they come in  make sure everything's balanced yeah my tank cost me two thousand dollars just to set up with no fish  in it yet right crazy person of money every fish i put in their diet because everything was point one  off right point one right threw a rock through it in my living room and just gave up right by the  way booger couch from arkansas he he's on to what i'm uh getting at all i'm saying in big news on the

[02:36:00]  to set it up and what you do is you put your first fish in how important is the salt how what  this isn't a class on on setting up fish tank you yeah you just say it's easy here's what you do  you get your tank you throw some water in there and you pull a little sprinkle of salt and you throw  a little shark in there and you go get used to it put some salt sugar some sausage little wine 
[02:36:30]  swim faggot swim imagine that screaming at a fish that just lay there swim faggot we got fish tank  phone calls did you notice also that that guy worked in a fish store yeah so of course it's  fucking easy for him yeah it's like a an astronaut calling go flying the shuttle's easy guess what's  easy i've done it guess what's easy to us doing radio yeah piece of cake you come in you yap into a  mic how hard could it be right fishball your fish tank your fish store yeah he's an expert in the

[02:44:30]  these these things that uh  yes these commercials for tbs yeah it's like we get comedians to do like little jokes about this what is it like the sponsors it's like if if if a show is brought to you by let's just hypothetically say geico or whatever they'll have some stand up comics make like a 30 second like little funny bit and like it's all set up where they're in front of a crowd like they're at a gig like it's part of their set oh my god  Like, it's part of their set.  Oh, my God.  Because TBS is Slugline.  It's like, TBS, really funny, or that's funny, or very funny. 
[02:45:00]  So they try to make some kind of funny joke out of a sponsor.  And it's always just awful and terrible.  And I feel so terribly for these comics.  What comics?  Any ones we know?  Or just some hack open mic?  I'm trying to think.  I mean, it's people I've heard of.  You might have cunt smells like Quiznos.  Cunt?  Can we find some of these?  Let's find some of these and get them on the air.  I don't think I've ever heard these.  I want to see how bad it is.  I have a lot of Quiznos jokes. 
[02:45:30]  I bet.  They should have gone to you.  Sure should have.  They call me the Quiznos.  It should have been them on the road.  Is Jeffrey Ross really doing Dancing with the Stars?  I hope.  That'd be great.  What?  He's got a bum hip.  Yeah, Dan the Trucker, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Mike.  Yeah, I'm not heading out until tonight.  I was watching Fox News, and they had a breaking story.  You were the first black Republican ad against Obama, man.  It was great.  It was great. 
[02:46:00]  It was great.  He basically wants to say, it's about time.  So you're an Obama fan.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, about as much as I am for Karl Marx.  I don't think so.  Oh, easy.  See, here you go.  You're a prime example of why I do think Obama is going to have a lot more trouble winning  than a lot of people think.  You are middle America, my friend.  You are the working class Joe.  Be proud.  You're middle America.  Yep.  And I think those are the ones who vote for that. 
[02:46:30]  We hang with the liberal douches here in New York.  On the coast.  Giving away all of Anthony's money.  Yeah, god damn right.  Money.  Back yet.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  We'll search that out.  I don't think we've seen that commercial yet.  Yeah.  And it's not by McCain either.  It's by a pack of black Americans, probably middle class, who are about taxes, getting overtaxed  and stuff like that.  I hear you.  What does this have to do with Fish or Barney Miller?  That's true. 
[02:47:00]  I don't know.  I've called from home, so I haven't been wanting to show, man.  Sorry.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  I'll catch y'all tonight on the, I guess, when y'all air tonight or something.  Well, I guess.  Well, you won't be catching us.  No.  You'll be catching some digital recording.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I mean.  I'll see y'all tomorrow.  I'll be playing hot.  I'll catch y'all tomorrow live, though.  When you hear this later, I'll be playing Hot Shots.  Oh.  Patiently waiting for Tiger Woods 09, which comes out tomorrow, my friend.  Well.  Nothing but golf games for the Opster. 
[02:47:30]  What's the difference between 08 and 09?  You know what?  I'll be cruising down the highway somewhere.  I'm not heading out until later tonight, anyway.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  There's no difference.  I know you're lonely, but we've got to go.  We've got to go.  We've got 18 holes.  Find someone else to talk to.  A guy with a fucking club and a ball.  Anthony's kind of right.  Same interface.  Anthony's kind of right.  You get excited because the new game comes out, and you're like, what really is different  about this game?  New courses?  Yeah.  Is that what you can?  Five?  Five new courses.  Five new courses.  Oh, wow.  They're all going to have green and a sand trap and a hole at the end. 
[02:48:00]  This is the one with the sand trap on 11, but the other one got the sand trap on 2.  Jimmy, you're showing you don't know much about golf, my friend.  Oh, I certainly do.  You don't know much about golf.  I played more golf than most people.  Yeah?  What's your handicap?  Minus 60.  Wow.  And can you have a minus 60?  I don't think so.  How many birdies have you had?  Dude, I fucking birdie more than most people.  That's what I've been told by the experts. 
[02:48:30]  They're like, we are going to nickname you the birdie kid.  What kind of loft wedge do you have?  What the fuck?  Loft wedge is for fucking pussies, man.  I don't loft wedge ever.  I fucking slug it off.  If I don't get a hole in one, I go home.  Do you know who invented the game?  Of course I do.  The Knights of the Links of St. Andrews.  They called it Garth, though, without the L.  No.  It was a fucking old guy.  It's a laugh every time.  Guy in Scotland.  Yes.  What about putting?  Do you stand?  Ted golf.  Do you stand?  Ted golf.  Ted golf.  That's right.  I like to hit a ball into a hole.  I don't know why. 
[02:49:00]  It's just fun to do.  I'd love to do this 17 more times.  Ted golf.  I need a bigger area to do it in.  My yard is only three feet by two feet.  I'm always winning.  Ween Jihuahua.  Ween Jihuahua.  Ween Jihuahua.  If I don't turn that stupid music off, I'm going to slap the fat pelican neck in that room.  Tiger has a limp in 2009. 
[02:49:30]  So, in the 2009 version, you get to play.  Oh, he has his bum hip.  Yeah, sure.  He fucks a hot blonde in the middle of the fucking tee.  He dog fucks her behind an oak tree.  While fucking that other cunt is blowing it again.  Who's the one that blows it every year?  Greg Norman?  Who's that shit stain that always ruins it?  Phil Mickelson.  Phil Mickelson.  The fucking clit.  He's the biggest choker in golf history.  What a choking clit.  Hey, we got the Tiger Woods 09 commercial.  Can I see that?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Wait, but now we're talking about golf.  Only fish stories and golf.  But we will talk about the band fish.  A little stretch, but they are fish.  Wow, that is dull.  That's what you got to do in the fucking golf hole.  You got to fish your ball out.  So it ties in nicely.  Fish your ball out of the hole.  See, I didn't invent it right.  I didn't have a hole in the ground.  I put a giant stick with a cup on top of it and tried to hit it way up in the air.  And they said, Ted, this is not feasible.  You'll never get anybody to do this. 
[02:50:30]  And I wanted acres of land.  Nice.  All right.  The Pat Duffy stuff's worth playing again.  I'm Pat Duffer.  Well, we're running out of fish material and Barney Miller material.  So now we got that.  Yeah, give me something on Barney Miller there, Jimmy.  Oh, that fucking, what a show, huh?  Hey.  When they did that thing.  Remember the episode where Woj got caught liquid shitting into the coffee pot because 
[02:51:00]  he thought Barney Miller fingered his grandmother?  But then it was just a big mistake.  It turned out it was Abe Vigoda dancing with a little girl on his feet because he got his  rolls mixed up.  And they said, this is the Godfather.  And he says, can you shit in my cup wounds for old time's sake?  He said, can't do it, fishy.  This is network television.  I'd love to liquid shit in your coffee for old time's sake.  And then Barney Miller was fucking, was arresting gay guys in the men's room because they were  blowing each other through holes in the wall. 
[02:51:30]  And he bumped into Serpico who was accused of a homosexual encounter.  It was a big mess.  At the precinct.  Barney Miller was a fucking, was a corrupt fuck.  Barney Miller would actually, would actually take $4 a week to allow kiddie porn to be smuggled.  He was not a good fucking cop.  $4 and a ham sandwich between two diapers.  That's all fucking, that's all he wanted.  I like the other guy.  Why is Kathy Lee Gifford trying to look like she's young? 
[02:52:00]  What is that on the back of her head?  A big fall.  Hopefully a hand.  That's all fake hair.  What's she doing?  I don't know.  Piling up fake hair on her head.  It's cool.  It's fucking Jeff Conaway's wig from Taxi Season 3.  Like to fuck her face.  Oof.  Oh, is that her?  Which one is she?  On the one, the right with that huge rat tail.  Oh, who's the bitch on the left?  That's who I meant.  That's a fake.  Oh, the one on the right is awful.  All right, listen.  Why don't we do the Pat Duffy thing?  Now, do we want to hear Pat slapping the Russian broad or you want to go right to the kicks? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Let me have some slapping.  The video's good, but I told Sam to re-edit it and just have crotch shots.  Crotch shots, it could be a big video, I'm thinking.  Because I've never seen anyone get kicked harder in my life.  Take a shot like that.  In video or in person.  Yeah, here's from Friday's show.  You've got Pat Duffy and he's seen this Russian broad.  Looks like they're an item.  Who was the guy, quickly to go reverse into Barney Miller again?  Who was the guy that used to come in? 
[02:53:00]  Hey there, Barney.  Hey, he was the lieutenant, was he?  Oh, that was Merv the ass rapist.  No, not Merv the ass rapist.  Wasn't he like a character actor?  He was in a lot of stuff?  Yeah, but he'd always talk about, you know, in the old days, we used to tone him up.  You wouldn't get lipped like that.  And he'd talk about beating the shit out of the skells that they bring in.  Club soda Barney?  Yeah, so it was.  It might as well have been Kenny.  I don't know.  I don't remember the show.  Now, in the early 80s, they would say, in the early 80s, the police were getting away 
[02:53:30]  with a lot of good stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And I say a lot of good stuff because I think they should be able to do whatever the fuck  they want.  Sure.  But you know, when they were around the precinct, people were going, oh, in the old days.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Just talking about that.  When the 80s, looking back, were unbelievable what they were doing.  But you know they had some old schoolers in the joint sand.  Oh, back in like the 50s and stuff.  Going, oh, in the old days.  They must have really done some damage.  Yeah.  All right, well.  What a time to be a police officer.  I don't know who that guy is, though, Ant. 
[02:54:00]  Before you could just bash people.  Who are you talking about?  I'm not sure what his name is.  Lieutenant Dan?  Lieutenant Dan?  No.  Eh, we'll figure it out.  Somebody will say it on that.  All right, here we go.  Frank Luger.  That was it.  Frank Luger.  Look him up.  It was Luger.  Look up Frank Luger as we play the first clip.  Pat Duffy seeing this Russian broad, and this is definitely not going to end well.  This is like a recipe for disaster.  Oh, yeah.  That's a nice relationship.  This is how it started on Friday.  This came out of nowhere, by the way. 
[02:54:30]  Don't worry.  I'll console you afterwards.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure you will.  Oh.  You're going to get fucking slapped later really hard.  Holy shit.  Except for you.  All right.  Oh, is that...  We really beat the shit out of each other.  Oh, yeah.  I got bruises like all up and down my thighs.  You're like a healthy couple.  I can't believe you're not more involved.  Mickey and Mallory.  What does he do?  Yes.  He slap you as he's having sex with you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where?  All over?  Yeah, everywhere.  Face?  Mostly the face.  Mostly the face.  Do you like it?  Oh, yeah.  You like getting slapped in the face while he fucks you?  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  I like it even when he's not fucking me. 
[02:55:00]  Really?  All right.  Give her a slap.  Let's give her a little slap.  Wait, wait, wait.  Holy shit.  Did he nail her?  Nice.  God damn is that good.  She's a trooper.  Crazy.  We had a lot of bad timing on Friday's show.  I fucked that one up.  Vinny Brand fucked up one of the kicks of the groin.  Because I think we get all excited and we want everything perfect and the people aren't  reading our minds so they're like, all right, slap, poof, as we're still talking.  Yeah, it's very hard to get people to do things when they're supposed to. 
[02:55:30]  Right.  So you go, okay, we want you to slap her in the face.  Wham!  Yeah.  It's like, no, like after we set it all up and get everybody quiet.  Well, because we're trying to get the audio just right so everyone can really enjoy it  out there.  But they're not thinking that.  They're like, oh, you want to slap her in the face?  No, you're stupid.  Wow.  And you slap him back?  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Give him one.  All right.  Can we get the head out of the bag?  Higher.  Higher.  All right, listen.  And Ant messed that one up.  Yeah, I messed that one up.  I messed the first one up.  You messed the second one. 
[02:56:00]  God damn.  I'm the only one apparently that knows how to not mess things up.  Thank God for me.  Let's see if we get this one right.  All right.  You want to slap me again?  Sure.  All right.  All right, please.  Same side?  All right.  She swings hard, man.  Being slapped with her shit-stained fingers.  I'm not as good with my left.  You backhand me with that.  You've got to get a solid.  That was my jaw.  That's fucked up.  Oh!  What the hell?  Oh, dude.  Look how pissed he is.  He's not pissed. 
[02:56:30]  He's getting really horny.  Ew.  No.  It's a combination of both.  More rage.  Pat, will you have a black eye for that?  That's a big hit.  No.  Do you want to punch me?  No.  Who's that?  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right, then.  Is Pat Duffy in today?  I want to see what...  No?  We'll get the Pat Duffy update hopefully Thursday.  Somebody.  Mike and Fresno.  I want to talk to him.  Serious Playboy Channel has wow.  What's that about?  Hey, Mike.  What's up? 
[02:57:00]  Hey, is this Jimmy?  Yes, we're here.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  I felt it was forgotten today.  I borrowed my wife's car the other day and had Serious in there, and the Playboy girls  have a new thing called Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Oh, yeah?  Come on.  Where I guess you're supposed to mail in pictures of your tits.  How about that?  That's wonderful.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  You bet.  All right.  Some people are actually going, cam it up. 
[02:57:30]  They heard the clips, and they're going, put the cam on it.  We said this is from Friday.  Hey, you dummy.  We're going to get back to the kicking audio in a second, but we found the TBS thing.  So what is this again?  So it's like, let's say you're watching Family Guy, and Family Guy is brought to you  by, in this particular instance, Coors Light.  So then all of a sudden, it cuts to like there's like a stand-up doing his act, and now he's  doing a funny, quote, funny joke about Coors Light, or Geico, or Quiznos, or whoever the  sponsor is.  Whatever the sponsor is.  So this is the only one I could find. 
[02:58:00]  There's much more worse ones than this, but this is the only one I could find.  I'm going to try and get more.  Are they good?  Ugh.  No.  Jimmy, would you do one of these?  Love to.  I'm sure they'd find my material to be apropos for the occasion.  All right.  Let's try it out here.  Let's think of a sponsor that hopefully doesn't sponsor our show.  Let's pick a sponsor that they're using.  Let's pick a sponsor that they use, and then before we hear the comedians' material.  What's this for?  This one is Coors Light.  Coors Light.  All right, Jimmy, your stand-up and Coors Light.  Coors Light.  What a good drink, because whenever I have Budweiser or Miller, I punch my wife right 
[02:58:30]  in the cunt.  Not with Coors Light.  See?  I tuck the kids in, and I go to bed early and get up for work.  Hey, that's good.  I like that.  See, you can do these.  That's funny.  Here's an actual one from TBS.  I like Coors Light.  That's the best.  They always try to fix the bottle.  They're like, ooh, we have a wide mouth can, we have a vent can.  They're going to have a bottle that turns blue when it's cold.  Listen, Coors Light, the can's fine.  Find a way to put more beer inside. 
[02:59:00]  That's what I want.  Yeah, how about a Coors Light bucket or like a Coors Light IV for my dad?  I want to be able to snorkel in Coors Light.  Dan's got a drink, all right?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  How bad do you need TV time?  Well, there's a chick comic.  I forget exactly who it is, but she's talking about how hard it is to shop for cars because 
[02:59:30]  they all make her ass look fat.  Oh, God, of course.  Fucking chick comic using that.  That's the Lisa Landry one.  Can I address somebody, please, who emailed me this?  Carol Fergal.  Who's Carol Fergal?  Carol.  Hi, I'm Carol.  Here's the email address.  O-C-A.  O-C-A.  R-R-U-I-L.  R-R-U-I-L.  At Yahoo.com.  At Yahoo.com.  Who's trashing me for doing Fox Red Eye. 
[03:00:00]  And it's fine if you don't like the show.  You don't like Fox Red Eye.  Apparently it isn't.  No, but this is what annoys me.  Red Eye is...  This is part of the email.  Red Eye is normally the show that you rip the piss out of.  And on this one, hey, the money must be good, but your credibility is in the septic tank.  Thanks, Jimmy, for being a Fox News credit.  You suck.  Hey, go fuck yourself.  I like doing the show.  I'll continue doing the show.  And I don't get paid at all for it.  You stupid cunt. 
[03:00:30]  And Red Eye is the furthest thing from everything else they do on Fox.  And it's not the fucking type of show I've been...  It's not even close to what the rest of Fox is about.  Chill.  They actually get really edgy and get some pretty crazy stuff done.  The shows I rip on are the ones that are the talking head shows that have, like, fucking three-second clips, like on MTV and VH1, because they don't let you be mean.  They don't let you do what you want to do.  Right.  Fox Red Eye, you can get away with a lot.  So, go fuck yourself.  Carol. 
[03:01:00]  Whatever your name is, go fuck yourself.  Is it a guy Carol, like Carol O'Connor?  Carol?  I don't know.  Exactly.  Well, that's not a name commonly heard on a man.  Woman.  Whatever it is.  I'm raising my hand to me.  How does a girl fuck herself, though?  Let her use a stick.  Let her pick up a fucking stick.  A stick.  One that you'd probably pick up, like, white-hardened dog shit off the lawn with.  Flick the dog shit over the fence and then fuck yourself with the stick.  All right.  There's the answer.  Pat Duffy, Russian broad. 
[03:01:30]  No money I'm not getting for that, you non-show business idiot.  Friday show.  The video's up on YouTube.  Just put Opie and Anthony in the search.  A better video of this is coming pronto.  But here's Pat getting kicked in the groin.  Harder than I've ever heard anyone get kicked.  Listen to this sound.  Well, the first one sucks because Vinny talks over it.  But after that, it gets good.  All right.  Tell me when.  I'd like to say them at the Trump arena.  Holy shit.  Worst timing ever.  He's plugging.  Like today, I'm going to be at the Trump arena. 
[03:02:00]  Worst time ever.  All right.  Tell me when.  I'd like to say them at the Trump arena.  Oh!  Holy shit.  This poor kid is getting kicked in the nuts.  And we ain't getting the audio.  And the first two times, we missed it.  We missed it.  So now, you know, we're professionals.  We know we still got to get the big hit with no one talking.  He's down. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, he's down.  He's punching the floor.  He's down.  Did you like it?  Oh, that was awesome.  You really liked it, Pat?  Yeah.  We're going to do that later.  We didn't get good audio on that because Vinny was talking.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah, Vinny, shut your fucking mouth.  Hold on.  Everybody.  All right.  Shh.  Okay.  When you're ready.  Shh.  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit.  All right.  She fucking wailed.  All right.  Holy shit. 
[03:03:00]  There's no effing way.  There's no effing way anyone can take a shot like that.  There's no effing way anyone can take a shot like that.  He's sweating.  He's sweating.  Dominatrix is...  Pat, you all right?  Kick guys in the balls.  There are guys that will get kicked in the balls like that for an hour.  Yeah.  No fucking way.  Holy shit.  That was fucked up.  Pat, you all right?  Yeah, I'm great.  Great.  Why am I bouncing up and down?  I should be jumping up and down.  Why?  Because it hurts.  Wow. 
[03:03:30]  Unbelievable, right?  Jesus.  That sound.  It doesn't even sound like someone getting kicked in the nuts.  It sounds like you're kicking like a football.  Sure.  Give me one more.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  One more.  You're crazy.  Wait.  Good audio.  All right, guys.  Here she goes.  Go.  Go.  Holy crap.  I'm leaving.  You're, like, feeling his pain. 
[03:04:00]  Holy shit.  Dude, I'm dizzy.  And I didn't even get hit.  Wow.  How the fuck can you take a shot like that?  They are fucked up.  Because I deserve it.  We're back live.  He is a weird motherfucker, man.  Yeah, he scares me a little bit.  Hey, who's Pamela Paul?  We got an email and she took a shot at us on the show in the New York Times book review.  Oh, yeah.  Can we get that?  I don't know.  Did we have it?  Yeah, I saw it on a Google or something.  What was the shot?  I don't know.  I got to see it now.  We've been good boys. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, I got to see it now.  I got to see it now.  I just had enough of people.  I really have.  Haven't you?  I'm fucking enough with the New York Times book review.  The snotty twat.  Can we have that?  Can we find that?  Please?  We'll get that.  I've had it.  She was describing a book and said something like it's as funny as trying to listen to Opie and Anthony.  Okay, let's give her email out again and show her what funny is.  Wait, wait.  I'm not sure.  Let's find her.  Fucking cunt. 
[03:05:00]  Shut up.  Fucking cunt.  You're irrelevant.  Fucking biased paper.  How about Jason Blair?  Why don't you have him write the book reviews?  Fucking hiring quotas.  Liar he turned out to be.  Yeah.  Fucking shitbird brood.  All right, this is what she said, Jimmy.  All right, what'd she say?  Wow, she looks like someone that would be listening to our show, first of all.  Oh, really?  Like one of the guys?  The art of M-O-M-O-I-R.  What's that?  I don't know.  So she's talking about some book, and then somewhere in there she says,  For 16 bewildering pages as I was subjected to capricious, all caps, 
[03:05:30]  rallying against convection, oven-baked, and left-wing mass emailers,  I feared I was in for an over-joking, under-funny mess of a book,  like being stuck on the freeway with Opie and Anthony for 300 pages.  Hmm, stuck on the freeway with Opie and Anthony for 300 pages.  I guess the snotty twat that writes for the Times book reviews is not a fan of the show. 
[03:06:00]  Too bad, you're the target audience we were going for.  Women that haven't been fucked properly in six years.  That's the ones we're going for.  We're part of pop culture, my friends.  What's wrong with this woman?  Who is she?  Pamela Paul from the New York Times.  Of course she works for the Times.  Beautiful Pamelio.  Pamelio.  Fucking hate that shit-rag paper.  What, um, I get that she doesn't like us, but what was the problem?  And why wouldn't you change the dial?  How does one get stuck? 
[03:06:30]  I was stuck listening to Opie and Anthony for 300 pages.  First of all, you can't listen and read.  You have to do one or the other, right?  She was equating the book to our show.  Yeah, and just didn't know how to do it right.  And being stuck.  And probably, probably, we get to tackle the left-wing shit she probably loves.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking biased.  Oh, shut up.  Those misogynistic right-wing.  Yeah, exactly.  Shit it.  If anybody would like to get in touch with Pamela Paul.  No, no, Danny.  That wouldn't be right. 
[03:07:00]  They could contact her.  No, I can't allow this.  And voice their own opinions about the Opie and Anthony show at Pamela, at PamelaPaul.com.  PamelaPaul.com?  She's the author of Parenting Ink.  Why would you parent ink?  Parenting Ink.  Seems like it's fine by itself.  You hold the ink jar in your asshole and dip your quill into it.  Fucking bitch.  Can we see your website?  And, uh, wait, there's also another book called Pornified and also a book called The Starter Marriage. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, she sounds like a fucking ball of shit, this one.  Ugh.  What a ball of shit this Pamela Paul sounds like.  Here, the Pornified.  How pornography is damaging our lives.  I love this woman.  Yeah, you know why?  I guaranteed one of her husbands was just in front of that computer all the time.  Cranking.  Just spewing a mess all over the place.  And she was like, why?  What happened?  Well, there are girls on the internet I'd rather jerk off to. 
[03:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right, here we go.  I want to see her website.  Yeah, let's go to...  Yeah.  Pop her up on the, uh, screen up there.  Oh, this fucking...  I want to see what this fucking...  Wow, she's obsessed with us, huh?  We don't know who she is, but she knows who we are, guys.  There she is, Pamela Paul.  I wouldn't mind fucking her face, though.  I might, uh, no.  She's like a fuckable little face.  Yeah.  I would give her a poop shoot fucking myself.  Parenting Ink.  She's probably an uptight, one of these uptight fucking moms that blames everybody else for 
[03:08:30]  the fact that kids suck, other than fucking, like, overworked people like herself who are  probably not doing their jobs.  You used the word swarmy in there.  What's that?  Swarmy.  Swarmy would never fit.  No.  I don't know that's the word.  Smarmy?  I don't know what swarmy is.  Uh, she's just a douche.  She's fucking...  You know what, though?  She's not bad-looking.  She's fucking...  She's bent over, like, on this counter, and that little fucking ass is poking back.  You might want to, yeah, give her one.  I wouldn't mind grabbing her hips and fucking her from the back. 
[03:09:00]  Look at the picture of her.  You'll definitely want to fuck her.  Like, she probably...  You know what?  A woman like that uptight probably would love a good, deep fuck.  You think?  I absolutely do.  Because I think that most people who tend to go in one direction so far are probably  overcompensating for something.  And how does she know about us?  She probably listens.  She probably listens.  Who knows?  She probably shams her pussy and listens to the show.  That's my guess.  Oh, look at that sexy picture she has up there.  Danny, find some good stuff about Pamela Paul.  Thank you.  Why don't we just get her on?  Yeah, that's a good idea. 
[03:09:30]  That'd be nice.  The Greg and Tony Show.  I want to review her.  I want to talk about her book.  I think she'll know.  No, she won't.  She'll be stuck on the freeway listening to the Greg and Tony Show.  Let's give it a try.  All right.  Hey, a Fox News reporter goes into a group of any war protesters.  Have you seen this yet?  Outside Democratic Convention, and they curse at him.  Of course they do.  Oh.  This is good.  I'm not going to talk to you.  Do you believe in f***ing speech?  Andy War!  Right here.  What's your name?  Come here.  What's your name?  What's your name?  My name is me. 
[03:10:00]  My name is Junior Melendez.  It's f***ing war!  Oh, come on.  That's not necessary.  Do you have a message?  F***ing!  Do you have an actual message with that?  F***ing!  Do you have an actual message without cursing?  What's your message?  Stop the torture.  Stop the war.  Stop the torture.  Stop the war.  Do you not believe in freedom?  Do you not believe in...  F***ing!  F***ing!  Well, I've got to let it go with that, Jamie.  It's a little bit out of control here.  That's just not necessary.  F***ing!  F***ing!  F***ing!  F***ing!  All right.  Well, we're going to go then because it is out of control. 
[03:10:30]  I love how angry I am.  That's really out of control.  Shut the f*** up.  Exactly.  You got caught.  Take it.  The f***ing f***ing news chat was pretty loud.  Do you not believe in freedom?  Do you not believe in...  All right.  F***ing!  Well, I've got to let it go with that, Jamie.  It's a little bit out of control here.  That's just not necessary.  F***ing!  F***ing!  All right.  Well, we're going to go then because it is out of control. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, shit.  It is out of control.  He is a little angry.  There you can see Griff Jenkins, our own Griff Jenkins, in the midst of the crowd, giving  them a chance to speak out, to tell what their message is, and they're not even talking.  All they're doing is screaming and yelling at him.  We'll make sure he's okay.  We'll check back with him when he can get himself sort of away from that really raucous  crowd.  Yeah, well...  Raucous.  He's fine.  Exactly.  He's fine.  Don't worry about him.  Griff Jenkins. 
[03:11:30]  I have issues with him.  I am Griff Jenkins.  Linga-longa.  Griff Jenkins.  Griff Jenkins.  All-American Griff Jenkins.  Oh, Griff Jenkins is a tool.  What a dumb name.  Griff!  Authorities in suburban Atlanta say Darlene Dukes did not have to die.  Officials say the 39-year-old woman called 911 because she was having difficulty breathing, 
[03:12:00]  but a 911 operator misheard the address and sent the ambulance to the wrong place.  The mistake caused a 25-minute delay in response, and it's not the first mistake.  In 2007, Grady EMS pulled our medical call-taking out of that communication center because it  was taking in an inordinately long period of time to dispatch critical, life-threatening  calls.  So this is not one employee.  This is a systemic issue.  There's problems here.  We need to fix this.  People are suffering and people are dying. 
[03:12:30]  And quite honestly, this situation, which is sad and tragic, could have been prevented.  Well, maybe it was how she was saying her address.  It was hard to understand.  Aren't they supposed to just be able to pop that up?  With the caller ID, right?  Yeah, maybe she had one of those, you know, phones that are going over the Internet that  can't get 911 or something.  Duke's parents say she eventually died from a pulmonary embolism.  Officials say the operator should have noticed that the call came from a cell tower in North  Fulton County, 30 miles from the mistaken address. 
[03:13:00]  City officials say the 911 operator was fired, but local doctors say this is a systemic problem  and that the call center director should be fired.  They're calling for an independent investigation into the 911 center and its practices.  So the guy got fired, though.  Yes.  He made a mistake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little mistake.  Fire him.  Yeah.  Just fire him.  It's like, by the way, is anybody else's cable doing this?  When you watch digital cable, it's kind of like, and it squeezes up, and then it blocks 
[03:13:30]  up.  Yes.  I'm fucking sick and tired of digital cable.  It gets all cubed up.  I'm fucking cubing up every time I watch a show.  Fix it.  Yeah.  It looks like a Pablo Picasso painting all of a sudden.  Dude, it's enraging.  And then he goes.  Especially when it changes from dark to light, or light to dark, or fast movement, changing  that.  The compression just can't handle it.  And you get this pixelated mess that freezes. 
[03:14:00]  Or your screen just goes black, and then comes back on.  Like, what the fuck happened?  I think us and you have different cable companies, because you're on Long Island.  Same problem, though.  Because I know, because Verizon Fios is supposed to come to the area soon, and I want to switch  to that, but who knows if it's going to be any better.  I don't know.  It's got great reviews, but who knows if it's going to have the same problems as Time Warner  and Optimus.  Are they digital?  It's all digital.  Why is Verizon better than Time Warner?  I don't know.  I just remember reading some reviews, and it was like the customer service. 
[03:14:30]  There's an ultra-fast fiber optic that they're using, and it goes right to your house.  See, the fiber optic cables that everybody uses, it's really fast, but then when they  bring it into your house, it goes back to regular cable, which slows it all down.  But they have a way now of bringing the fiber optic directly into your house, and hook it  directly up to your router.  Oh, for internet?  Yeah.  For both.  Internet's around now, and I think the cable's coming later in the year.  But so far, from what I've read, it's the fastest. 
[03:15:00]  So it's the fastest internet you can even get.  It's ridiculous fast.  Okay.  But again, it's like anything else.  It depends on how many people are using it at one time, how many people are on your  node.  That sucks.  Yeah, you watch some of the high-def channels, and you're like, yeah, this is good, until  something moves, and then it gets pixelated and ruins the whole experience.  I never had that.  Some of them aren't even high-def.  For instance, like TBS, a lot of the shows that they present in what they call HD is just  a stretched-out standard-def.  I know, that's so funny. 
[03:15:30]  It's like, upscale, it's stretched out.  It's like, don't fucking-  It's like, TBS HD, unnecessary fucking channel.  It's like, why am I paying for this?  You're playing- I don't think they filmed Gilligan's Island in HD.  I don't think you fucking-  They're just stretching out old Seinfeld episodes.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, it's widescreen, but when they go to the edge, everyone gets fat.  Gilligan's Island, there was not one laugh to be had on that show.  Not a one.  That fucking show.  Except, all right, when the professor raped Lovey.  That was funny.  That was funny.  Because he used his fist, and he was so angry while he did it. 
[03:16:00]  Yes, he was fucking- finally lost it, being shipwrecked for so long.  Thurston was a cuckold, and he used to like how the natives would fucking- would deep-dick  Lovey in a big pot of Berlin water?  Berlin water.  Berlin water.  And he'd have to be a- he liked what a bunch of-  I like when the bulls come, Lovey, when the bulls rape you.  No.  That big fucking- their big ethnic penises poking through their grass skirts.  Lovey, Lovey, here come the natives again, Lovey.  Yes.  Oh, Thurston. 
[03:16:30]  They'd fucking choke her with her own scarf.  Give her-  Throat yogurt.  They used to like to make throat yogurt.  I'll give you millions if you just come in a face while I watch.  Just fucking ravaged by natives.  And the professor used to like Gilligan to take marmalade and rub it into his buttocks  because it was sore.  Gilligan would rub scented marmalades into the buttocks of the skipper.  And like when Gilligan's finger would strain, he would tickle bag. 
[03:17:00]  No one said nothing.  No one said nothing.  No.  Because it was all those years of smelling the skipper's big ass in his face in the hammock.  Oh, in the hammock?  Fucking bunk bed hammock?  Gilligan would always turn around at night and put his face the other way where his feet  were by the professor's head.  This way his nose was under his big Alan Hale asshole.  Could you imagine the fucking ass smell that the skipper would have on a daily basis?  Yeah.  Just ass-crack sweat from being on a tropical island with no laundry? 
[03:17:30]  Wearing a pair of Dockers afraid because he can't get off.  Fucking big, dirty fucking bunion feet.  Skipper's a creep.  Fucking despise the skipper.  So glad when Bob Denver died.  You didn't do anything, dude.  The fucking show is horrendous.  I like the full pod way late in his life.  They'd jump up in the air and make them run fast.  Oh, I love when they go in fast motion.  Oh, how funny is that?  Oh, it's not. 
[03:18:00]  If Gilligan prevented you from getting off that island so many times, wouldn't you just  fucking kill him and get him out of the way?  I'd cut his throat like a Chechnian.  I'd bleed him out like a fucking Chechnian rebel.  Yeah, where's that episode where they bleed out Gilligan?  Like his throat is wide open and he's blinking slowly, but he can't move his head?  Now we'll finally get off this island.  That's all he hears.  Will they just bleed him out?  We get it.  Gilligan's going to mess it up again.  They have a plan.  They're going to go. 
[03:18:30]  It's the same fucking show.  I guess you guys are right.  And then they'll just go, oh, Gilligan.  I remember when the professor hollowed out a coconut and then mashed warm coconut pulp  and then used it as a pocket pussy.  Oh, shit.  Instead of a radio, he made a pulpy pocket pussy.  And he would fuck it while staring at Mrs. Howell through a hole in the tent.  And he fucking blasted with a cannonball.  He would always, he fucking, he hooked up a toilet cam so he could watch Mrs. Howell shit. 
[03:19:00]  Take our old lady corn shits.  Yeah, her fucking three-hour dumps with her polyester pants around her fucking feet.  Coconut dumps they're all taking.  Chris Rabb wants to know if Mr. Howell had anal beads made from coconuts.  And little seashells.  He liked the seashells because they would tear the lining on the way out.  Oh, look, they're talking about the plugs of Mr. Biden.  Are they?  Look at us.  We're on top of everything on this show.  Where is it?  Fox News Channel, the VP plugs. 
[03:19:30]  Where's the ones now?  I guess they're all gray ones, huh?  Look at the bottom right-hand corner.  What a wispy head of fucking hair that is.  What a wispy do.  All right, let's do woman argues with atheists on public access.  This is some good stuff.  Okay.  She makes a very good argument here.  God's everything.  So if you don't believe in him, then you believe in nothing.  Oh, okay.  So you're defining God as everything.  Well, God made everything.  Like, how can you walk outside and look at the trees in the sky and be like, there's no God. 
[03:20:00]  The Big Bang didn't make the trees.  And can we turn that up a little bit?  I'm having a problem hearing it.  Okay.  So I'm kind of confused because you've said God made everything, and then you've said God is everything,  and now you want us to look at trees, and that's evidence of God.  Well, yeah.  The Big Bang didn't make the trees.  How did the trees get here?  Acorns.  Oh, what a dummy.  Well, what about those?  And what about before that and before that?  Right.  There was a Big Bang, dummy. 
[03:20:30]  And if you look at the genetic code for life on this planet, the evidence points to the fact that there is sometime way back in our history,  a common ancestor, that life is this divergent pattern, a self-replicating divergent pattern that has evolved over time through natural selection.  That's where the evidence points.  Good answer.  She thinks the Big Bang just happens and then, like, trees flew out of it and just landed and rooted.  Like, she has no idea that the Big Bang happens.  And then millions, like, they have no concept of millions upon millions upon millions of years that this happens and a planet is formed. 
[03:21:00]  It's molten.  She thinks the Big Bang was like a piñata that somebody hit.  Yeah.  Like, the shit was already inside.  Animals and shit and everything just banged off onto Earth.  What a dummy.  Like, it takes millions of years of cosmic goo mixing together in the perfect situation, the perfect distance from the sun, rotation, everything. 
[03:21:30]  And then before you know it, some organism, and that is debatable, where that came from.  Well, the Big Bang is like blowing a dandelion.  Yeah.  Where is it going?  And then all the seeds go and do their thing.  Do their thing.  Why would God, if there was, why would he make a Big Bang?  Like, if he was going to start the whole world, why not just go, all right, there it is?  Well, that's what they assume he did.  That's like what the Bible says.  He, you know, made it in seven days or six days.  How long were those days, though, my friend?  Six days, and then he rested on the other one.  How long were those days?  24 hours. 
[03:22:00]  Nope.  Some of those days could have been a lot longer because it was before he took care of the sun.  Are you using Rathacon rules?  Yeah.  By the book, it would take three days.  By the book.  Here's Khan.  He's supposed to be this fucking genius.  I was just watching Rathacon the other day and laughing my balls off.  He's a superior race, Khan.  He takes a starship.  He's, you know, brilliant.  And he can't get past the code that, you know, by the book, we'll be ready in three days. 
[03:22:30]  Get it?  And then three hours later, he goes, bleep.  All right, beam us up.  He goes, but I thought it was three days.  Coded message.  It's like, what the fuck?  Khan can't figure that out?  This is geek stuff, Jimmy.  Oh, no, it was great.  Because I watched that.  I also watched, which I haven't seen in a long time, and we only goof on the part where he pulls the tacks out of the map.  I watched Mask.  Oh, very good.  Rocky Dennis. 
[03:23:00]  Very good.  Movie.  Yeah.  Holy hilarity.  Oh, my God.  When she touches, the blind girl touches his face, and she thinks she's touching, like, the fucking mountain area of a train set, of a Lionel train set.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Stupid Laura Dern.  My favorite part is when Laura Dern's parents come to get her, and she's going, Rocky, Rocky, looking around.  And he walks over, and the parents, the way they look at him, oh, my God.  Oh, are they horrified.  Oh, her. 
[03:23:30]  Halal  And when the camp counselor comes over  He goes, alright, show me those pearly whites  It's like, no  Show me those fucking chiseled up  Looks like he's been chewing on lock washers  A lock  With a big chin he has  With his big dumb chin  And what were the fucking motorcycle gang  The Turks  They hang out with some big headed fucking freak  Some stuttering asshole  Mother had too much crank in her womb  Yeah, mother's all fucking drugged out 
[03:24:00]  They wouldn't have sympathy for Rocky  They stunk  Take him to the carnival, go on carnival rides  And bumper cars, they're a biker gang  Should be racking head and selling meth  They would have played soccer with his head  Yeah, his big head  Oh, we have another clip from this  Especially since he wrecked her pussy coming out  They can't even fuck her anymore  Thanks to old Mount Rushmore  That fucking head  Old Matt pinpuller  Why didn't Ben want to go to Europe?  Was it something about that he was tired of Rocky  Sewing four hats together and wearing them? 
[03:24:30]  Dude, that was another thing I saw  When his grandfather  Took him to the baseball game  The Dodger game  And he comes home all happy  And Cher is just fucking all drugged out on the couch  But he comes in all happy  He goes, look for my god  And he throws a baseball  And he's got a little Dodger cap on that giant head  Really?  It is the funniest fucking thing  It's a tiny little Dodger baseball cap  On his giant disgusting head  On his giant Mr. Met head  Oh, that giant misshapen thing 
[03:25:00]  So why didn't Ben want to go to fucking  Ben, as it turns out, was living with his mom  And not very happy  He was going to school  They had just graduated junior high  And he decided to live with his father  In another state  Because his father hooked him up with a job  So instead of going to school  He quit school and got a job to make money  Oh, but what?  And Rocky Dennis got all mad  And had to pull the pins out of the work  And said, you know  You're just  You're stupid  You're stupid 
[03:25:30]  Called him stupid  Where were they going to go in Europe again?  Oh, everywhere  Italy  England  It was the whole fucking thing  Was full of pins  Where he would take his huge head on tour  Around fucking Europe  Exactly  Jesus Christ  You could have called Ringling Brothers  They would have flown him for free  Giving him first class airfare on Virgin  Fucking freak  Giant head  Should be in a tent with gypsies dancing around it  I gotta see that movie again  And then the people that just go 
[03:26:00]  Hey you  Over there  Take that mask off  So we can see who you are  He's like  Well, if I could  And he's like  Oh, I'm sorry  Take that mask off  What's wrong?  My mom says I look like a lion  Did she really say that?  Yeah  That's what he told Laura Dern  Because she was a lion  She looked like  When mom said I look like a red-headed bag of shit  Would have been more accurate  Mom said I'm an embarrassment  And a cunt wrecker  Mom said I'm a pussy ruiner  Because the size of my head 
[03:26:30]  It was like shitting a red-headed bowling ball  I look like a lion  Do you really?  You Burt Lars sack of puke  Shut up  The blind girl-assess  Touch my face-assess  Yeah, she goes in for the touch  And he just grabs her hand  Like, no, no  This is going quite well  Exactly  How could she tell though  Fucking after she kissed him  With those filed down teeth  Holy shit  Yeah, that kissing scene 
[03:27:00]  Was really disturbing  Oh, Rocky  Rocky, come meet my parents  And they were like  Oh  Well, it's time to go  We want to beat traffic  The father says  And then every time he called  The mother's like  No, she's not here  She's having her  She's having her haircut for three days  Wait, I mean  I think you're kissing him  It was like kissing a hot air balloon  With like a gorilla's asshole taped to it  That's probably what it felt like  Picture a fucking hot air balloon 
[03:27:30]  With a gorilla asshole  In the middle of it  And then his mother  Gets a fucking prostitute for him  Because he was like  It's about girls, Mom  And storms off  So she gets all tanked at a bar  And goes up to a hooker  And sends the hooker  Into the room with him  And he doesn't even  You know, fuck her  He sits there and talks  The first thing she goes  Says is  What's wrong with your face?  Did she say it to him?  Yeah  I think Mom would have warned her  Yeah, right?  Look, he's a nice guy  You ever  How much to fuck a monster? 
[03:28:00]  What do they talk about?  They talk about the school  And what she wants to do  Like, she was a real person to him  So, you know, they had a great time  They were both monsters  And then he talks about Mount Rushmore  How he can't wait to be a part of the team  Fucking lunk-headed zelch  That is the definition of lunk-head  His head is a lunk 
[03:28:30]  Was the rest of his body normal?  Yeah  The rest of his body was all normal  But he had that giant fucking head  And the bridge of his nose was fucked up  Yeah, that disease we just talked about  Last week on the show  Oh, and then they  Mark giantis  Hilari-itis  Hilari-itis  And then they were at the fair or carnival  And they went into the hall of mirrors  And one of the mirrors  You know how the mirrors make you look tall or short or something?  So he went into one that squished everything  And he looked at his face  And saw, like, what he would look like, kind of  If he didn't have that disease 
[03:29:00]  And that was a sad moment for him, right?  And he's like, oh, he's looking in like  Oh, look, this would have been me  And you could tell  They, like, took some of the makeup off of him  And shit, it just wasn't the mirror  If I could just pass  Don't bullshit me  If I could pass these mirrors around to everybody else on Earth  They could hold them up when I walk by  Hey, can we see a picture of him, Danny?  Where is he?  Where's stupid Rocky Dennis?  Put on his big fucking head  Rocky! Rocky!  I just  It was so fucking great, though, watching it yesterday  Because I know we always goof on the map  But there's so many gem moments in there 
[03:29:30]  His big stupid head  I can't wait to see him  Oh, God, look at that  Eric Stoltz  Wasn't that his first role?  And you couldn't even see him  Oh, that's Eric Stoltz?  Yeah  Holy shit  Yeah  I just realized that  What did you think he was, Robert Plant?  That's how Robert Plant looks now  Holy shit, you're right  That's a good one, Jimmy  Got a whole lot of love  Ah, look at him 
[03:30:00]  Oh, what a dumbest smile  A dumb fucking smile on his face  Big dimples  He's got the eye man in him a little bit, too  Oh, yeah  Yeah  That was, I wish the picture of him with the Dodger hat was there  It is so tiny on his head  I gotta see it  Oh  He's freckled, too, with red hair  And he fucking, he got a baseball, too  He caught a baseball at the game  Probably because the hitters were just aiming for that giant head  It was a good target for him  They thought it was that giant thing in Milwaukee that pours a beer 
[03:30:30]  And one of the brewers gets a home run  Or the apple that comes up at Shea Stadium  Because it's red and giant  It's red and huge and ugly  And an eyesore  His head was an eyesore  Disgrace  They had to build a barn around it because neighbors complained  Zoning ordinances  Let's go to Scott in New York  Scott  Oh, shit  Hey, Anthony  Hey  How about the scene where he tries to get on the ride  And the guy's like, I can't take responsibility 
[03:31:00]  What happens to the retard?  Yeah  He goes, I'll take all your  Yeah, he goes, I'll take all your tickets  But we can't take the retard  And then, what's his name?  I always forget his name  The guy with the deep voice  He was in Roadhouse  Oh, Sam  Sam Ilyon  Yeah  He's like, you take all the tickets  He's ready to kick some ass  Because he was a Turk  One of the biker gang  The Turk  He was the lead Turk  And they did nothing  They hung out, drank beer with a big-headed dolt  Exactly  And a fucking stuttering, fat member of the biker club 
[03:31:30]  Put the one with the tie  Oh  Which really does make it look like a fucking balloon  That's when  That's when he had to go to the graduation  And he was mad because he didn't want to go in jeans  So they told him to grab them another beer  And when he opened up the fridge  A nice suit was in there  In the fridge?  In the fridge?  Yeah, in the fridge  Where his feet should have been in a formaldehyde jar  Fucking asshole  How is he going to graduate?  Giant jar  Have to build him a new hat out of gravel  They, yeah, he went up there and won all kinds of awards

It was very close  Drew Barrymore  Yeah  Looks like Rocky Dennis  I could see that  Is that a true story?  Kind of think  Mask?  Yeah  Yeah  Supposed to be  And then he died at like 16  Yep  Went to bed  And then Cher is like  Cher takes the phone call  And goes, hello  And it's the school saying 
[03:33:00]  Rocky isn't in  And she goes, yes he is  He would never miss a day  And then she goes, oh  And then hangs up and looks at the bedroom door  And it's still closed  And she's like  And then she walks in  And just starts to open up the shades  And she goes, well, how do you expect to get a scholarship  If you're not going to get out of bed?  And then she looks over and he isn't moving  Oh boy  And then she touches him and goes  Oh, you're cold  You don't have your blanket on  Touches his big head  It's like, no  No  Fucking  God finally realized the severe error he made 
[03:33:30]  And took it back  It's raining  Let me get you the tarp  So you can put it over your head on a stick  And go to school  He has to cover his head with the same thing  They used the infield for  Fucking Dodger Stadium  He has a grounds crew  Fucking head  Forrest Gump cuts his hair on the riding mower  Anthony in San Francisco  Yes, Anthony  Yeah, what about the part  When they get him the suit for graduation  Because he's got nothing to wear 
[03:34:00]  They killed two birds with one stone  Because they buried him in it six months later  All right  Jesus  What the hell, Anthony  Holy shit  Now that's some thinking right there  Oh, they buried him in a bass cello case  His legs and body were in the part where the neck goes  And his head filled up  It's like one of those  He looks like an upside down stupid Mexican bass guitar  Rocky Den ass

[03:35:00]  Hey, we got one more clip  From this atheist and woman arguing  Horrid  On public access TV  The atheist wins  The only thing he's gonna say is Rocky Dennis  Rocky Dennis  No God  I do recommend you watching that movie for the laughs again  It's hysterical  Stephen S for Basher found the real Rocky Dennis picture  Where?  Have you ever seen what he really looks like?  Is there a real one?  Oh  Get the real Rocky Dennis  Go to Wikipedia, my friend  Wow  Look under Nagel  And then you go image  Nothing  Image 
[03:35:30]  Image  Oh, there it is  Oh  Oh, what did you do?  Oh, fuck  God damn, Danny  By the way, for the listeners  Tomorrow, I apologize  We'll get back to fish talk  And Barney Miller talk  Oh, yeah  It's a must  It's a must  Why can't you grab both lines?  It doesn't let you do it  Mother fucking cock  Let's go to Wikipedia  There it is  Oh  Wow  That's the real Rocky Dennis?  He's actually a better looking young fucking person  He looks like  There's a  Wow 
[03:36:00]  What were those things in Star Wars?  Oh, shit  The  Mon Calamari or something  Bubba Fett  He looks like those big fucking eyed  Wow  Those eyes are wide apart  Wow  He certainly does have some wide apart eyeballs  Giant glasses bridge he must need  Wow, right?  That's what the bridge over River Kwai was  The thing that held his glasses on his stupid nose  Fucking  Wow  What's it say about him?  That must have been  He must not have seen properly 
[03:36:30]  Of course not  That perspective is like  Everything he looks at is a 3D movie  Rob in New York  Rob  Hey, guys  Which one of you can recite that poem that Rocky had to read to the class?  Something like  These things are good  There's sun shining on my face  Things I like  What the fuck was it?  Rain on my tongue  Did he really say that?  Yeah  Because the shower won't reach  Like this fucking face blocks all the shower water  So you need clouds and nature to get rain onto his tongue 
[03:37:00]  And then, yeah  And it was the sun shining on my face  And then the things that are a drag  Which happens even when he's on the other side of the moon  That was a lame-ass poem  When the sun's on his face  Something is being eclipsed  I have the full poem if you want it  Oh, okay  Yes, let's hear it, Danny  These things are good  Ice cream and cake  A ride on a Harley  Seeing monkeys on a tree  The rain on my tongue  And the sun shining on my face  These things are a drag  Wait, let me guess 
[03:37:30]  Mirrors  Social interactions with women  The sound of laughter  See number one again  Okay, what  Girls' tits I know I'll never touch  What things are a drag  Proms  Dates  Happy occasions  My chin on the ground  Light bulbs at work  Family photos  The click of a camera  The sound of a blind date scarf 
[03:38:00]  Peeling out  Holy shit  Cars in front of his house  Leaving in fast motion  Like the dates that came to the Munsters house  Oh shit 
[03:38:30]  Things that are a drag  Oh what else is a drag  Please  Mom's womb  Halloween masks  That only come up  From the top of my nose  Oh boy  What are some of the things 
[03:39:00]  Things that are a drag  The real things that were a drag  Is dust on my hair  Holes  Holes in my shoes  No money in my pocket  And the sun shining on my face  Why is that a drag?  I guess because he has so much face  It makes him really hot  See the first one was good  Because he likes the feeling  Of the sun shining on his face  But the last one was bad  Because he doesn't like the sun on his face  Because it's light  And then people can see him  And that's the beauty of the poem  Right  When he goes to get on the bus  To go see his chick  And the guy getting off the bus 
[03:39:30]  At the same time  Gives him a great look  It's just like  Oh my god  There are laughing creatures  On this fucking bus  The sun shines on his face  It probably tans in sections  Like the top is really good  And the chin area  Is fucking peely  And flecky  He used to get like sunblock  15 through 58  And apply them appropriately  On the fucking paint roller  Ope mentioned that  There was a little bit of the Iman  Going on in Rocky Dennis  I just  Travis told me 
[03:40:00]  If you google image Rocky Dennis  It's a full page of just Rocky Dennis  And then one Imus picture  Oh look there's Imus  Nice  There you go  Alright here  Let's get this other clip out of the way  The real Rocky Dennis  Was better looking actually  Than the movie one  He looks  It's different  He looks like something  That lands and puts an anal probe  In you and leaves  No kidding man  Wow when he was a kid  Let me see the top picture  When he was a kid  There it is  Aww  He was born with the rare  It's a form of giant  It looks like  Hedda Nussbaum 
[03:40:30]  He died in 78  He was 17  Yeah  Roy Dennis  Here we go  78  I thought it was like 80 or something  That's where the real Rocky Dennis died  Not the movie  Yeah 78 is close to 80  I just take movies as fact  Oh no  Yeah  Alright  Here's that lady arguing about religion  God and stuff  Okay so all those chemicals just got together  And randomly created life  So if we get a whole bunch of chemicals together  No  Then it's going to create life again 
[03:41:00]  No  Which they've never done  No that's not what anybody's actually saying  If your objection is that life can't come from non-life  Now you're talking about abogenesis  Which some people do and don't include in evolution  But it wasn't  We're not just talking about simple happen  Who cares about this at this point  Mongo go ahead  Listen to this  If you visit the Rocky's grave  Does it look like a pitcher's mound by the head storm?  And he punches out nice 
[03:41:30]  It wasn't  We're not just talking about simple happenstance  The original creation  The formation of life  May have been the wrong  That's great  Mike Pittsburgh  What's up?  I bet you his graduation camp  Had to be like a big shitty pizza box  Pizza box  With a tassel  I love that 
[03:42:00]  May have been the rough equivalent of happenstance  But that doesn't mean  Just in Ohio  Another thing Rocky hates is a stretched out t-shirt neck  And you can just throw a bunch of chemicals together and get life  Okay  Well so you don't see God in anything  You don't see God out in the world  Everything's designed for us  Like the banana's designed for us  It fits in the head  It fits in your mouth  It fits in your  Not in mine 
[03:42:30]  Maybe in yours  Do you think that was the intended purpose?  Do you realize that the bananas that you eat  The bananas that you're looking at  Are actually cultivated plants  Created by humans  That don't exist in the wild  They can't reproduce on their own  What?  Do you realize that?  God didn't make the bananas you eat  We did  Whatever  So you can make a banana appear in your hand right this minute?  No  See you're just atheist because y'all want to see it all the time 
[03:43:00]  That's it  You got it  Wow  And the guy made some good points  Sure  I don't know about the banana thing  Hope they don't like that one  It's alright  You missed the lines from our listeners  One of which is  Does it look like a pitcher's mound at the headstone of Rocky Dennis' grave?  The graduation one  Yeah  For his graduation cap 
[03:43:30]  Did they use a pizza box?  And Jim I think the best one was also under things that are a drag  Stretched out t-shirt necks  Let's go to Bob in Alabama  Alabama  He walked over Anthony's best line  Things that are a drag  My chin on the ground  Implying he had a big chin  Alright very nice  Let's get to the line of the day  As the Rocky Dennis lines continue to come in  To me I was just giggling on the way in because 
[03:44:00]  He died 30 years ago  We just did a half hour of making fun of Rocky Dennis  Because he just saw the movie  Who died yet 30 years ago  I think that's funny though  Oh yeah  Let's say hi to Mike in Chicago  Hey guys how's it going man  The Windy City checking in  Is your book photo just one page?  Yeah  Oh my god  Jason in Carolina  Jason  Hey  Hey man  Hey  I got something that Rocky hated  Yeah  He hated the helmet laws 
[03:44:30]  He had to holl on a Volkswagen Beetle  Put it on his head  Things that are a drag  Being an archery target  He would have to put a kiddie pool on his head  If he wanted to go for a bike ride  What a big headed creep  Let's get to the Lord  Boo  His head is just 
[03:45:00]  Hours of joy  For the real Rocky Dennis  Things that are drag binoculars  That's a good one  Steven asked for Bayshore  Not only was Rocky never able to visit Europe  But he couldn't get into New York City either  His head kept getting stuck in the Holland Tunnel  They wouldn't even have binoculars for him  It would be two telescopes 
[03:45:30]  With a 2x4 between them  Here he is this  Look between these  Dummy  Let's go to Rich in Philly  Rich  Hey guys  Rocky went to the Dodger game  With his grandfather  And he came back with the Dodger cap  Yeah  Really?
