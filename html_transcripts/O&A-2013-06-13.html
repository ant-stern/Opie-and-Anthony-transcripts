<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in their characteristically crude and sexually explicit banter.  They reviewed the previous day's guests, including Seth Rogen and a "teen mom" who, they suspected, deceptively presented a pornographic video as homemade.  The hosts debated the ethics of confronting her about this, ultimately deciding against it due to exhaustion.  This segued into a discussion about women using sex tapes to achieve fame, citing Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton as examples, and a porn star's attempt to sell the teen mom's unwashed bikini.

The conversation then shifted to Jim Norton's recent experiences, including a visit to a new sushi restaurant and a viral video clip of him behaving oddly during an interview with Ozzy Osbourne.  The hosts played and analyzed this clip, generating considerable laughter.  This led to reminiscing about past encounters with Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons, emphasizing Norton's nervousness in those situations.  A substantial portion of the show focused on sushi, comparing Japanese and American practices, specifically concerning soy sauce, wasabi, and rice preparation.  A caller, Don, contributed further insights into authentic Japanese rice preparation and wasabi.  The discussion also touched on the prevalence of fake tuna in many sushi restaurants.

Next, the hosts transitioned to a discussion of a New York City window washer scaffolding incident, which sparked a conversation about Philippe Petit's tightrope walk between the Twin Towers, highlighting the inherent risk and lack of safety precautions. They analyzed photos of the event.  Opie then shared a Vine he made of Alec Baldwin and a woman near the New York Public Library, prompting a discussion about the changing role of public libraries and the decline of physical bookstores.

The show's middle section began with a discussion about the surprisingly high number of AOL dial-up users and the frustration of canceling AOL accounts.  This transitioned to a discussion of their recent podcast featuring Doc Gooden and David Lee Roth, noting varied listener reactions.  A significant portion was devoted to an in-studio interview with Scott Thorson, Liberace's former lover, recently released from jail with the assistance of Dennis Hof.  Thorson detailed his relationship with Liberace (including graphic descriptions of Liberace's penis), his subsequent drug use, involvement with Michael Jackson, being shot multiple times, his involvement in the Wonderland murders, and his testimony against Eddie Nash.  A brief humorous excerpt from Amy Schumer's "Inside Amy Schumer," featuring Club Soda Kenny, Jim Norton's bodyguard, was also included.  Nick DiPaolo was mentioned as a guest, though not present during this segment. The overall tone was highly informal, with frequent profanity and sexually explicit content.

The interview with Scott Thorson continued, focusing on his relationship with Liberace, his plastic surgery, allegations of abuse, subsequent legal troubles, incarceration, health issues (including anal cancer), his role in creating Liberace's museum, and his potential reality show with Dennis Hof at the Bunny Ranch.  Thorson recounted encounters with Merv Griffin, Michael Jackson, and Zsa Zsa Gabor, shared his opinion on *Behind the Candelabra*, and discussed his time in prison.  Dennis Hof was present in the studio.  The conversation contained graphic descriptions of sexual acts and drug use, maintaining an irreverent and humorous tone despite the seriousness of some topics.  The discussion later shifted to sports (NHL and NBA playoffs) and a news anchor's on-air gaffe, also mentioning the movie *Vice Squad* and its memorable dialogue.

The final segment covered the George Zimmerman trial, focusing on its racial aspects, complaints about New York City's mayor and his policies (bike lanes and climate change), a recounting of a Black Sabbath interview, and a humorous video of a drunken friend entering the wrong car.  A phone call with YouTube personality Max Koch, featuring his impressions, was included, along with a discussion about the selective editing of news coverage surrounding the Trayvon Martin case, the hosts' Twitter battles following a Robert Zimmerman interview, and a neighbor dispute.  Nick DiPaolo was a guest in studio, and a pre-recorded "Primetime Sam Roberts" bit was featured.  Highly offensive language was prevalent.

The show concluded with Jim Norton fielding listener calls. He gave away a signed Black Sabbath box set.  The calls primarily centered on relationship and addiction issues, with Norton offering candid advice.  Callers discussed issues such as alcoholism relapse, heroin addiction, infidelity, strained father-son relationships, sexual dissatisfaction, and concerns about a spouse's trustworthiness. Norton's advice was often blunt and laced with profanity. The show ended with commercials for Dollar Shave Club and Steven Singer Jewelers, with Norton's characteristic humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd, and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, the last you did.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Tying to these people.  Up my ass all the time, trying to get me to help.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gun, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  No soy.  No soy.  Isn't that Spanish? 
[00:02:00]  No soy.  Oh.  Yeah, it might be.  Literally.  Literally no soy sauce.  No soy sauce.  Hi, everyone.  Good morning, everyone.  I don't remember being here yesterday, I gotta admit.  Were you snoozy?  I was extremely fucking tired.  Yeah?  Yes.  Got a good night's sleep.  Yeah?  What did I miss yesterday?  Uh, well, we had, uh, Seth Rogen was good. 
[00:02:30]  I, I was engaged in that.  Yeah, yeah.  I asked a few questions.  We had some, uh, teen mom girl that took it in the ass on video and insisted that it  was just a, uh, you know, just a video they were making instead of a porno.  I gotta, I gotta admit, and I was, uh, telling you before the show, she was lying through  her teeth, in my humble opinion, and I guess you gotta say that so you don't get sued, but  I didn't have the energy to fucking go after her.  Yeah.  I didn't like her at all. 
[00:03:00]  And, and it's not fair to say it now because she's not here, but I just didn't, I just didn't,  I just wasn't on my game.  She fucking, she filmed the porno.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, I did a little more research after the fact, which is stupid, but like I  said, I was, I was just really tired yesterday.  Sleepy.  And the guy she did the scene with when, when on TMZ and everything said, what is she  talking about?  This, we set this up and it's obvious to everyone it was set up.  It looks very professional.  Right. 
[00:03:30]  But in some weird, I don't know, I guess we just felt, we, we all just kind of felt like  just leaving her alone.  You get into these situations where it's like, why am I going to bother getting into an  argument with the guest when it really doesn't matter?  It's like, who gives a shit?  What do you mean?  I love that shit.  I just wasn't, uh, you know, willing to do it yesterday.  Sometimes it's fine.  Right.  But in that case, I'm just like, let her talk about taking it in the ass and fucking, you  know, shit like that.  And then she's on her merry way. 
[00:04:00]  And then she's another one who thinks that this is going to like, uh, you know, send  her into the stratosphere of fame.  Well, I guess they're giving her a show.  I told Anthony we get one a year, one of these broads a year that think they're, uh, you  know, they're going to be massive stars because of some weird sex thing.  Yeah.  It just doesn't happen ever.  Except for Kim Kardashian, obviously.  Paris or for Paris.  Did Paris start with a sex thing?  Sucking a dick.  She was blowing that shit.  She wasn't famous before that?  No.  Okay.  Maybe well, maybe well known, but not like, but yeah, so I guess this is what, uh, you 
[00:04:30]  know, the, the girls are thinking that this is, you know, what happens next, but yeah,  but I mean, we all saw the scene.  That's a, that's a porn scene.  We all know it.  With the acting and I'll be right back.  And she walks downstairs and, and then I, uh, I asked about the bikini because supposedly  what some guy wanted $40,000 online for the bikini unwashed.  And I asked about the bikini and she goes, I wasn't in charge of that.  And that only hit me after the fucking show as well. 
[00:05:00]  I'm like, what do you mean?  If it wasn't a, if it wasn't a set up thing, what do you mean you weren't in charge of your  own bikini?  Wouldn't it be your bikini if it was just a thing that happened?  Yeah.  You'd think how the fuck did they get it?  Yeah.  And he's a, yeah, he's a, uh, a well-known porn star.  Of course.  Yeah.  The guy.  What's his name?  Jesse, uh, or Dean or something.  James Dean, right?  Dean spelled a little differently, probably.  D-E-E-N, I think.  No, not D-E-N, right?  They always have wacky names that sound like celebrities and things like that. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Yeah, she, uh, eh.  And then she, she couldn't even describe her new show that is or isn't on television or  coming.  It's like, oh, what's your show about?  Oh, it's me, you know, finding myself.  I'll get back to the asshole banging clip.  She's a youngster.  She's a youngster.  I know, that is true.  She's going to feel like an idiot when she gets a little older, I think.  I guess I'd bring it up because, uh, I don't know.  It was bothersome. 
[00:06:00]  There was something about it that was bothersome.  And maybe, maybe we shouldn't have just, maybe we shouldn't have went after her.  I don't know.  But if she was older, I'd say, yeah, kill her.  She was just lying.  Don't you want to?  She was just lying.  It's just, you know, and she's got her little publicist and, you know, they're putting her  in her little, her little career.  What are you going to do?  Good luck to you.  I know.  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  We'll, we'll check in with you in a year.  What are you going to do?  Let's see what you're doing.  Yeah, it may be amazing.  We've seen a million of these broads.  It may be amazing or it may be terrible.  It may go nowhere or something, you know. 
[00:06:30]  I'll acknowledge it's not fair because she's not here now, but whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was telling Jimmy before the show, I was telling Jimmy before the show, I found a new  sushi joint because me and Jimmy share the love of sushi.  Jimmy turned me on to a place in L.A.  Jimmy calls it sushi.  Sushi.  Sushi.  I like to have a little sushi.  A little sushi.  A little soy sauce maybe.  Is that the gym?  That's the gym.  Is it eating better?  Starting the show?  I'm sorry. 
[00:07:00]  I downloaded the clip.  Somebody posted it.  I put it on my phone.  Last night, I just, for no reason at all, I just kept clicking play and listening to that  clip.  It fucking is my new favoritest thing to listen to.  Hopefully you've heard the new one.  The new one?  What do you mean the new one?  Oh, is there a vine that I missed?  No.  Oh?  No.  But I perhaps caught myself.  I tweeted it last night.  Oh, no.  I tweeted it last night.  Aye.  Perhaps I did it again when I sat down with Ozzy and Geezer in person. 
[00:07:30]  No.  For the first line only.  Again.  Perhaps.  It's only the first line and then you turn it back into yourself.  And video.  Oh, is it from the town hall?  Oh, my God.  It's from the opening of the town hall.  I was having an intern go through the whole thing just to maybe get some stuff.  Oh, God.  It's only that opening moment.  Oh, I want to hear it.  So, it's on your Twitter?  Yeah, yeah.  Hang on.  The rest of the night, that doesn't happen.  Yeah, but I heard you might have said a word a lot. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, yeah, I did.  Okay.  Let's see.  I did say a word.  Was it awesome?  Did you say a lot?  Was it awesome?  Oh, you're putting it together?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Hey, buddy.  It's Jim Norton.  We are serialized.  Oh.  Go a little bit.  No, way back.  Oh, way back.  All right.  Now, go to when I walk in.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  More fast forward.  Right there.  I'm scared.  How are you?  Good to see you.  Ozzy, how are you guys?  Where have you been?  I was outside.  It's doing the opening.  Let's see.  Hey. 
[00:08:30]  How are you doing?  A lot of other people here.  How are you?  What are you doing?  I don't know.  It's creepy.  Dude, it's creepy.  Do the opening?  It's creepy.  What is this about?  It's not about sounding British.  It's creepy.  I know.  It's a weird...  Just settling in for a second.  I don't know what it is.  Do you want to hear it again?  Yes.  Do you want to hear it again?  Yes.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good to see you.  Ozzy, how are you guys?  Where have you been?  I was outside.  It's doing the opening. 
[00:09:00]  He's fucking Ringo.  I was outside.  But then it goes right back to normal.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah, there are a lot of people here.  How are you?  All right.  How are you?  That was it a little bit.  Yeah, but that's more...  Right, right.  That's more like...  That was a little bit.  Yeah.  Oh, I love it.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Ozzy, you saw us?  Ozzy, how are you guys?  Where have you been?  I was outside.  It's doing the opening.  Ozzy, how are you? 
[00:09:30]  Wow.  I thought you saw that.  No, no, no.  I tweeted that last night.  I was so happy when I saw that.  I'm like, oh.  Oh, no.  I crashed.  Oh, my God.  Because I haven't watched this since...  Outside?  I was too busy watching...  In the opening?  Dancing and singing vaginas last night.  Oh.  Yes.  Oh.  We're not talking about that right now, but a little tease for later, I guess.  Nice.  No, I have not seen this yet, Jimmy.  You will, though.  I certainly will.  Yeah, no, no.  I mean, just that moment.  I watched that. 
[00:10:00]  But then the rest of it is normal.  I watched it.  That's fine.  What?  To the opening?  Then I went to the gym?  Teaching batter?  Wow.  Oh, I'm a true ass.  And then, of course, from our show...  Ozzy Osbourne.  How you doing, Ozzy?  Take a seat, my friend.  Hello.  Hi, guys.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Take a seat.  How are you?  You've got so much fun.  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot.  Just going to the gym.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  That's it. 
[00:10:30]  What's wrong with me?  I have mental problems.  I love it.  Going to the gym?  Just going to the gym and eating better.  It's just a little weird, though.  You fucking wanker.  What do you think I'm doing?  You fucking wanker.  I don't know what happens to me.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, bravo.  It's fucking great.  I love it.  Yeah, I haven't seen it.  I watched that.  I'm like, oof.  Oh, God.  I might as well bring it up before anybody else.  Yeah, someone would have.  Right.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  They're fucking fixated on it. 
[00:11:00]  No, they'll leave you alone.  Oh, yeah.  Sure they will.  Our guys will leave you alone.  They're cool.  But Twitterverse.  No, they're cool, right?  You guys are cool out there.  Oh, sure.  Sure they are.  Sure they are.  Every fucking...  They'll pick apart every photo that's on there.  And I just don't know what it is.  It happens to me.  I love it.  It's great.  Have I ever done that anywhere?  If anyone knows any other instances, please.  There has to be a few more.  I think we have to look at every Ozzy interview that was done. 
[00:11:30]  And shit.  I remember the first time Ozzy came into the XM Studios to do an interview with us.  And I'm wondering if you would...  No, I didn't speak.  We were all so flustered.  I didn't speak.  You talked.  Oh, God.  You were barely saying anything.  You didn't talk the first time Ozzy came in.  No, I did after like 10 minutes.  We started looking at you like...  We started looking at you like, wait, we're doing this for you.  This is Jimmy's guy. 
[00:12:00]  But I was so fucking...  That was like 2005.  Wow.  And I had...  Is that the first time you met him?  No, I met him once or twice before, but never in a sit-down with him to talk to him.  Right, yeah.  First sit-down.  I was fucking speechless.  And I loved Anthony that day because you were doing all the talking.  And you were doing a really good interview.  Oh, that was so funny.  And he was having fun.  And I finally just started talking.  We talked about trannies and girls.  And he said something about...  He said something about like... 
[00:12:30]  But you can't...  I don't suck dicks, Jimmy.  Or something.  He did something that he made fun of me for.  It was really funny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that was...  God.  You were staring a lot, I remember.  That was that.  And when Gene came to NAW the first time, I was so nervous.  He was like, ask him a question.  And I asked him about the person who he knew who had died.  Oh, God.  Because you guys thought I was joking.  You're like, ask your hero a question.  And I'm like, so how is...  This is like 2001.  I'm like, how's Star Stowe?  And that was a Playboy, beautiful Playboy bunny that Gene used to do photo shoots with. 
[00:13:00]  And he used to date her.  And she was fucking really hot.  And I figured he'd be impressed because I knew who she was.  But he goes...  And then you guys laughed because you didn't know what I was saying.  Star Stowe.  You're like, who's that?  Yeah, why?  So it was this weird thing.  And he goes, she died.  Oh.  That's not funny.  She died.  I wasn't making fun of it.  I didn't know.  Oh, God.  That was awkward.  You always have a problem with Gene.  But yeah, that Ozzy, I was very, very nervous.  Gene Simmons. 
[00:13:30]  Enough.  I know you love him, but...  I do.  I was very scared.  Enough with him.  I saw him last time at the roast.  He was...  I went to meet Jerry Lewis.  Really?  He was very pleasant, yeah.  Meaning you got to hear him talk about himself for 20 minutes.  No, he just said hello on the way out.  We talked for like a...  Oh, that's why he was pleasant.  Yeah, we just talked and he was...  The shorter time you're with him, the better.  Yeah, he was very...  He's like, you should have been up there today.  The better is for everyone.  Yeah, he was very nice.  I'm always happy when they're nice to me.  So you got to go to Yasuda. 
[00:14:00]  Anthony Bourdain recommended this place.  I asked him one day, the best sushi joint in New York.  He said, Yasuda.  And I went, finally.  It was great.  You got to go.  Yasuda, what makes this so much better than any other sushi place?  Sushi.  Sushi.  Sushi.  I don't know.  People start talking about the rice.  They say it's all about the rice.  Anthony Bourdain says it's all about the rice.  And then you got these guys that all they're allowed to do is handle the rice for like 10 years before they can even touch the fish. 
[00:14:30]  Fucking culture is amazing.  The Japanese culture seems exhausting.  Not the rice.  It seems a bit tedious.  Yeah.  Wasn't it 10 years?  You said there's a guy in Japan and he's learning how to be a sushi chef, but he can only fucking work on the rice.  And he's been working on the rice for 10 years.  He's never touched a fish.  And eventually he will touch the fish, but he has to perfect the rice.  In Japan, the hand can be used as a knife, but it doesn't work with this tomato. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I would love for someone to explain the rice thing.  Yeah.  We all make rice.  They're all about hierarchy.  I'm sure you can make rice better than how I make it, but I mean, to what point?  They're all about hierarchy over there.  Their whole fucking culture is based on a hierarchical system of, you know, you do this, you do this, you do this.  And you're very proud of whatever you do, no matter how menial it is, and that's how you work your way, you know, up the old pagoda. 
[00:15:30]  But rice?  I know.  It's amazing.  And the pride in that rice is insane.  Well, the rice in your suit was good.  I'll go there because I need a new sushi place.  You got to check it out and let me know what you think.  I loved it.  We sat at the sushi bar and the fish was room temperature.  And that's supposedly a thing, too.  More flavorful?  More flavorful?  Oh, I can't go back to a regular sushi joint now.  I won't.  I won't.  I won't.  I won't do it. 
[00:16:00]  And they had real wasabi.  Real wasabi.  That's the green stuff.  I like going, wasabi to people.  It's hilarious.  They laugh.  Where was that from again?  Right, Chip?  Fuck you.  Sounds like what's up, but you're putting in the knobby.  That's the old what's up Budweiser commercials.  Did they do wasabi, though?  Yeah, yeah.  They did that.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Wasabi.  No, because most sushi joints, Jesus Christ, that's got to fucking still wake up.  Sashay.  Sashay.  They don't use the real wasabi, either. 
[00:16:30]  No?  What's the difference?  It's horseradish that they dye.  Really?  Yeah, they dye it green for the most part.  Oh, yeah?  Real wasabi.  I think Anthony Bourdain was explaining it.  It's really, really kind of rare.  Really?  They're bamboozling us with fucking...  Oh, yeah.  That shit's fake, supposedly.  Fake wasabi?  Or maybe they have a little of the real shit in there, and then they fucking mix it with  the horseradish.  It's all cut.  Like fucking...  Yeah, I think they cut it.  Or...  Coke and baby left.  You know when you're having real wasabi.  It's not as hot, and it kind of falls apart.  I ordered delicious sushi yesterday from... 
[00:17:00]  There's a place on Grubhub.  There's an iPad app.  Right.  And it's fucking amazing, because you can get the...  You can order...  You can organize your restaurants in order that they are, like, highest rated.  Yeah, and it's not that expensive, this place.  I order from fucking three days a week.  It's very rare you can get out...  Like, out...  Out-call.  It's just a hooker's impression.  Out-call.  Out-call sushi.  Delivery.  Sushi that you trust.  But this place I eat at all the time, and I fucking settled down.  I was watching...  Was it Gary Sushi? 
[00:17:30]  No, which I do love.  I know you don't love it, but I love that place.  I'm not a fan of the Gary Sushi.  I don't know why.  But I sat down...  The bald-headed guy, Servian?  Yeah, bald.  That's always wrong.  And so I sit down, and I'm watching The Scarlet Letter with Gary Oldman and Demi Moore,  which was atrocious, and Robert Duvall.  It was atrocious.  Yeah, the pussy Hollywood adaptation that they make the ending happy.  Oh, God.  Just shit. 
[00:18:00]  Not that I wanted to be...  So I'm all settled in, and I really...  I mix up the wasabi and the fucking soy sauce, and I'm, like, ready to do some fucking  sushi dipping.  And I have my Diet Kirk, and I have an Ottoman's Diet Coke.  I said, give me a Diet Kirk.  Sometimes I go, you want a Diet Coke?  I'll be like, what?  He'll go, Diet Kirk.  I say that just to annoy the witches.  Kind of Diet Kirk.  I bet it works.  I hate it.  I hate it, and I do it.  So I have my fucking Ottoman, and I have a square glass... 
[00:18:30]  What do you put here, you know, a thing for my glass.  A coaster.  But a big, thick, like you'd murder somebody with this.  Right.  And I have a giant napkin, which goes longer than the coaster.  And I'm like, wow, the way I'm balancing the wasabi and the fucking soda, I should probably  be careful with this.  Oh, no.  Let me just move it over a smidge, and as I did, I looked down, and my full cup of fucking  dark, delicious wasabi soy tipped over, and I'm watching it leak off onto my floor, and 
[00:19:00]  I'm like, that looks like it's spilling.  Like, I couldn't react to it.  Why?  I don't know.  I just looked at it like I was watching a movie about an asshole who spilled his wasabi  and soy sauce.  I just panicked, and I couldn't react, and I'm like, you fucking dummy.  Like, I couldn't believe I had just done it in the middle of my fucking, about to settle  down for a meal.  Oh, how annoying is that?  It was enraging.  Well, that leads to the whole soy sauce thing at the restaurant yesterday, because a lot 
[00:19:30]  of people say that's American sushi, where we dunk it and fucking drown our sushi and  soy sauce and wasabi.  Real sushi, you're not supposed to do that.  I like it like that, even good sushi.  And at this place, we sat at the sushi bar, and I kept going to the guy, he's giving me fish  I've never had before, and I'm like, you know, soy sauce?  He goes, no, soy sauce.  Oh, see?  No, soy sauce.  Never ask.  No, then it was just a stupid bit I was doing with the guy.  I knew that I probably shouldn't ask.  But every time he'd put a new fish in front of me, I'm like, soy sauce? 
[00:20:00]  He goes, no, soy sauce.  Wasabi?  And then he shows me, he takes a smidge, like a little dot, and puts it on top.  I'm like, do you know what I could do with wasabi?  Oh, man.  I fucking butter it.  I butter my sushi with wasabi, usually.  And then have that fucking burning feeling and all that shit?  Yeah, yeah.  That's all American sushi crap.  And we think we're eating like they do in Japan.  No.  And he's like, no, soy sauce.  So then I was hoping that he would turn around to get more rice so I could do a quick dip. 
[00:20:30]  I was trying to get a quick dip.  Oh, you're trying to sneak one in?  A little bit.  I would dip it in front of his fucking face.  Why?  Because when I eat something, I want to eat it the way I want to eat it.  I don't want some fucking rules and regulations giving me shit.  Well, I guess, I don't know.  It was the experience.  And I'm glad I didn't do the soy sauce because I got to enjoy the fish without all that crap.  It was good. 
[00:21:00]  I like soy sauce.  But a little dip would have been nice.  Just a little.  Of course.  A little taste.  A little taste.  And this was a foodie joint.  You know when you're in a foodie joint.  Everyone at the sushi bar, we were just fooling around and having a good time with it.  These people were serious.  They all fucking knew the deal.  They were serious.  They were talking about how beautiful the fish looks.  They're staring at it.  They're like, oh, the color's just divine.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, look how fresh the eel looks today.  Oh, my God.  How do they keep fish at room temperature?  I don't know.  I don't know.  How do they do that and not have it rot? 
[00:21:30]  I don't know.  I don't know either.  I don't know.  I don't know how it all works.  They must know how much they're going to serve and then use the...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Guys, they just know.  They just know how much they're going to use it today.  You want somebody to explain the rice thing?  Yeah.  We have a guy that was in Japan.  Okay.  This guy, Don in Texas.  Don.  Yes.  That was Harry Truman.  I know it's going to be one of those.  Some assholes are going to call up in a minute and go, we're going to flip the idiot.  Well, we fully expect that, sir, but give it a good try. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Before that happens.  So what it is, it's not a matter of hierarchy as far as the rice.  There's one certain rice they use for, you know, making the rice balls and sushi and shit.  What it is, it's an honor thing.  You don't want to fuck it up.  You don't want to get it too sticky or too dry.  It's just what it is.  You know, you can go down to your local, I don't know, whatever stores you got there and buy the same shit.  Now, with the wasabi, the difference is that a lot of these places now, you know, there's... 
[00:22:30]  You've got the upper echelon restaurants there in New York, so it's a little bit different.  But the real stuff is in, like, these metal tubes.  It's like a squeeze tube, like toothpaste.  That's the real shit.  But most of these, like, probably 99% of the restaurants use this powdered shit.  And that's why you're talking about it so fucking hot is because they don't know how to measure it out.  They just sit there and dump it in and turn the fucking spigot on and stir it up until it's a paste. 
[00:23:00]  Well, I've also heard they cut it with horseradish.  Yeah, I mean, there's all that.  I mean, you know, it's whatever to save a little bit of money because the shit is expensive as fuck.  Yeah, I heard that.  You go down to, like, your local Asian market and you order it or you buy it.  Local Asian market.  Wow.  Yeah, who has a local Asian market?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  It's right next door.  We got them in Texas because we've got a big Asian population down here.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You know the fish is fresh in Texas.  Oh, yeah.  Aren't you scared of sushi in Texas? 
[00:23:30]  It always frightens me.  Not anymore.  In Vegas, I got food poisoning.  No, no, no.  No, you did.  I mean, you can find some decent, you know, like Little Tokyos or something like that.  And, I mean, it's really, really good shit.  And a lot of it's Americanized anyway.  So, you know, I mean, it's like eating pizza or something.  I've got to ask you one more question.  The fake tuna thing.  Do you know about it?  Because I'm obsessed with it now.  The fake tuna.  A lot of sushi joints and a lot of, like, supermarkets and stuff, they serve. 
[00:24:00]  They say it's tuna, but it's another fish.  I don't know the name of the fish.  What is it, like Pollock or something like that?  I don't know, but it looks.  And hates sushi, so this is, like, me and Sushi guy.  But most of the, they said in New York alone, 65% of the places you get sushi, they're not serving real tuna.  They're serving this other fish that looks like tuna, and they save a shitload of money doing so.  Albacore?  Yeah, maybe Albacore.  No, Albacore's harder to get, I think. 
[00:24:30]  Is it?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Albacore, we caught that shit off of California toast.  They got trips you can go out there.  Oh, you know, because Nizawa used to have it, but a lot of places didn't, because I guess it's only in season, like the real shit.  Maybe I'm wrong.  As soon as I learned that it's, because I would go to these places, and I would look at the tuna as my thing.  And I would look at the tuna and go, it looks terrific, but then you eat it, and it's just not as tasty.  And then I started getting suspicious, so I started doing some research myself. 
[00:25:00]  A regular detective doing your research.  So now I know all the sushi joints in my area that serve the fake shit, and I don't go there anymore.  I just ask any mermaid you happen to see, what's the best tuna?  Chicken of the sea.  What would you recommend tuna-wise?  Some tuna.  And I guess they get away with it, because technically it's in the tuna family, or it's not regulated, or something.  So they can say it's tuna when it's not the tuna that sushi people really, really enjoy.  Yeah, albacore is, we used to catch it off of the coast of California to go on these day trips. 
[00:25:30]  But albacore is like...  Day trips?  Day trips.  Day trips.  Yeah, well, you're looking at Peckin's guy.  That's a good one.  But it's a little bit better than what you're going to get in, like, the can, but it's not as good as they sit, they catch up like Australians.  All right.  Is it good if I'm trying to eat better?  Yeah.  Yeah, what if, can I have it before the gym?  Yeah, if I'm starting a show.  You know, I'm just doing things that the average Brit does. 
[00:26:00]  All right, brother.  Or the average Irishman.  Or whatever the fuck I am.  I don't know what happens to me, brain.  Spaniard, whatever the fuck you were doing.  Exactly.  I don't know who I am anymore.  Falling apart.  Perfect.  Fran, what's up, Fran?  Oh, Fran.  Boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's a rough name, Fran.  Hey, what a girl name.  Why didn't your parents give you the K?  Why didn't they just give you the K?  Okay.  Fran was better?  Fran.  Come, Fran.  They couldn't afford a K for you, buddy. 
[00:26:30]  What's the matter?  They gave it to my father so my little bitchy Italian mother would know who we were yelling at.  Oh, wait.  So there's a Frank and a Fran in the family?  Yeah, right.  Oh, my God.  Is your name Francis?  It is.  Oh.  I know.  How did you, did you grow up sucking, sucking cake?  What's that?  Are you gay?  No.  All right, just asking.  Calm down.  But there's nothing to matter with that, right?  We have Scott Thorson coming in later.  Yes. 
[00:27:00]  I failed, Scott.  Scott.  If you guys want to see something really fucking scary, get a blacklight and go into a sushi  bar.  A small one.  Why?  Run it over the sushi and you will not believe the amount of parasites and worms in the sushi.  Worms.  I think it's healthy shit, though.  Oh, man.  It is to a point.  I worked for a grocery distribution center.  We had...  Stop bragging.  A lot of people are saying you've got to do the blacklight over the sushi thing.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What does that do? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  What is it?  It shows all the shit that's on the sushi.  It shows how much cum is on it.  It's usually the blacklight gag.  Oh, my God.  I can't even imagine.  I'd make a sprooge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess it depends on what kind of fish you're eating.  But, yeah, you just roll it over the fish and you'll just see the worms that are in  it and the parasites.  All right.  I'm going to jinx myself.  I've never had food poisoning from sushi.  I've eaten a lot of it over the years.  Will that give you food poisoning?  No, it won't.  What do you mean?  Give you food poisoning? 
[00:28:00]  The worms and stuff.  Oh, that's on the fish.  I don't like the worm thing.  I don't mind a few, you know.  In raw fish, yeah.  Things that, you know, are going to be on there.  But worms.  I don't want to be wormy.  I don't want a wormy thing.  Wormy?  It's a little wormy.  Yeah, it's a little worm.  All right.  I'm not blacklighting my sushi.  Let's say hi to Graham in New Jersey.  How would you convince everybody in the restaurant to not do anything while you're blacklighting their  food?  Right.  You know how bummed they'd be?  Right?  I know how bummed they'd be.  You were doing a show and you had, like, shirts on called Parasites and Worms? 
[00:28:30]  That was your show.  Can you imagine walking in with a blacklight?  Yeah.  Before I eat, I got a blacklight of your fish.  Every piece.  Holy fuck.  Break it eight.  You would be a fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Graham in Jersey.  Yes.  Those crackers.  Yes.  Hey, who's your friend?  Ounce, pound, kilo, and liter.  Nice.  Fuck, fucker.  What's up, Graham?  Hey, you want enough measure?  Right.  What did I do?  Tell us s'mores.  Yeah, go ahead. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, Billy.  Sorry, Jim.  Yeah, buddy.  I don't want to violate tradition because Francis kind of did.  That first caller, Don, was a casual.  Very good.  Mind how it works?  All right.  It was good, but let's go now.  Yeah.  Don't make a bit of it.  Oh, shit.  When you're in sushi school, obviously there's always...  Sushi school.  Sushi school.  Sushi school.  Yeah.  I went there.  Oh.  But they told me my behavior was too fishy. 
[00:29:30]  That's good.  I know.  Oh, shit.  I stepped on Jim's bacon.  Oh, God.  No, you didn't.  I got it.  You didn't step on anything.  You didn't step on anything.  That school stinks.  Yeah, exactly.  Fishes are always in schools.  Oh, that's true.  That's a good one.  My mother said that's why they're smart, Chippa.  They go to schools.  That kind of school.  Yeah.  So what happens in sushi school?  Yeah, what do you do? 
[00:30:00]  Basically, the guys that really suck, they tell them that they have to cultivate rice for  10 years just to keep them off the streets.  And whenever a Japanese member has some foreign dignitaries show up, they pull them up to big  leagues for a minute just so they can poison somebody that they really don't like.  But basically, it's just a measure to get the incompetent assholes off the sushi line.  Really?  Yeah, because I can't imagine you would have to work with rice for 10 years.  I get rice in a bag.  I love it.  So, okay, you can make it a little better than that. 
[00:30:30]  But 10 years later, you're finally perfecting rice?  That sticky rice is pretty fucking good.  It's good, right?  Oh, God damn.  All right, Graham.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  One other thing, and certainly we can move on.  They don't allow tips at this place, which I found extremely strange.  It was a thing that went a little viral the other day.  I forgot what website I saw it on, and they're announcing they're not accepting tips at this  Yasuda sushi joint, which is on 43rd Avenue for the people in the area. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, and they said that's Japanese tradition.  So is it sushi joints in Japan that don't allow tipping, or all restaurants in Japan?  I don't know.  But I felt bad for the sushi guy when I was at the sushi bar.  Excuse me.  They don't care.  Your satisfaction is enough tip for them.  It's an honor thing.  He was great.  I wanted to just throw him extra on top of the bill.  You leave a restaurant. 
[00:31:30]  Very pleased.  That good enough tip for me.  Very good.  Your smiley face is better than any amount of money.  They say they're well compensated.  Yeah?  And I'm looking at these guys, and I'm like, they don't look like they're well compensated.  They could use a little extra fucking tip money.  No?  Because lunch wasn't that expensive.  We were all in, and it was only a little over $100. 
[00:32:00]  Maybe they get a bigger...  I thought it'd be way more, considering it's one of the better places in all of New York.  There's no tipping anywhere in Japan.  Anywhere?  Cabs, movers, whatever.  It's just not a cultural thing.  Not at all.  Very good to give people a good, very satisfying service.  And we don't need it here.  That's all well and good if you're living in Japan, but you're in New York City.  I think these guys need some tip money to pay a few bills. 
[00:32:30]  Wait, I got one.  Oh, fuck one.  Yeah.  The karate kid or something.  Anyway, enough about Yasuda.  Yeah, apparently.  Enough of...  You're right.  Enough about us.  Give us a fuck.  Give us a fuck about it.  Well, I may go there this weekend.  How about we go together?  How about me and you go and check it out, Jim Norton?  I may not be able to.  I may be preoccupied. 
[00:33:00]  Oh!  Whoa!  Well, that's mysterious.  I'm writing about it in my new book called Do Tell.  Preoccupied with what?  Perhaps a lady friend.  I'd like to meet a Rupert.  Well, we could double date then.  Ooh.  Are you ready for double dating yet?  Are you at that stage?  No.  No.  She wants to double date.  She wants to bring friends with her.  Oh, that's not good.  That's the worst.  It's the worst when a girl wants to come see her. 
[00:33:30]  Shall I bring some of my friends?  Will ya?  No.  That's good, because why would I want to get blown after?  Yay.  And then the worst thing, they bring, like, guy friends.  Ugh.  Like, if she brings another chick, and you're like, you know, okay, he's just fucking cock  blockers around.  But if it's like, oh, and this is my friend fucking Pete, or something, you're just like,  ah.  Yeah.  Why?  Get him out of here.  Yeah, exactly.  Tell your friend Pete to fucking hit the bricks and drop his...  Fucking shove.  Yeah.  Beat it, Pete.  Hit the streets, Pete. 
[00:34:00]  So we had some window washers, or was that just a scaffold collapse?  Was it...  Were they washing windows when that happened?  I think they were.  That was close to here.  That's a national story today.  It was very windy.  What were they, dangling 44 stories above ground?  Yeah, they were dangling in the wind, and I guess they had a little malfunction on that  scaffolding, and they had to get the emergency workers up there, pull them through a window.  They took out a couple window panes over there at the... 
[00:34:30]  They got them?  Yeah, yeah, at the Hearst building.  But I guess they weren't very scared or anything.  When the news helicopter flew by, one of the guys in the scaffolding just kind of very calmly waved to the copter guy.  Those guys are lot of ticks.  Yeah.  They set up outside our building, and they go on their merry way and go up that damn thing to clean the windows.  I can't imagine.  Yeah.  I would love to take a ride in one of those things, but no way.  And they seem to fuck up quite often. 
[00:35:00]  I would be scared.  I'd be scared.  Well...  It's always a little story.  I'm sure with the amount of scaffolding and window washers in the city, the amount that  have a malfunction is, like, very small.  But you're always hearing about it.  They got that down to a science, though.  The area they hang out in, it looks pretty secure.  They're tied to something else.  Like, they're okay.  Right, yeah.  Those things a lot of times come down unevenly.  Right.  And fucking, man, when they collapse and the guy falls out.  But the problem isn't really them falling anymore, because, first of all, a lot of these 
[00:35:30]  window washer platforms, the scaffolding, is connected to the building.  The new buildings have it built right into the building itself.  Yeah, they're on tracks at the top of the roof line, and they just swing them over, and  they're very high-tech and very stable.  Not like they're just kind of fucking hanging by some hooks that are on the side of the  building like the old days.  And they're clipped in also with safety harnesses.  But the trouble is, on windy days, when it's smacking around like that, they could be 
[00:36:00]  crushed.  They could be thrown against the building.  Jesus.  So it's not so much falling, but getting knocked around pretty bad.  Wouldn't you just keep the windows dirty at that point?  But it's a business for somebody.  It's a big business, apparently.  Look, we don't give a fuck.  It's windy today.  You've got to get up there and make money for the company.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Oh, we said, Sam, that's a good picture.  Damn.  That's crazy.  It looks like it failed in the middle and kind of, like, buckled in the middle of the  support.  That's crazy. 
[00:36:30]  They're just standing there waiting.  Oh, wow.  You've just got to wait.  Hey, help!  Right.  Help!  Oh, that would be fucking awful.  I was looking at old school pictures of New York last night.  Mm.  It relates to this, and they showed pictures of that asshole, Philippe Petit.  Yeah.  And I was having anxiety attacks.  That's crazy.  Ever since I did that stupid Chrysler building thing, I have anxiety attacks when I see these  fucking people doing these crazy fucking height things.  Crazy, right? 
[00:37:00]  Dude, I'm looking.  He's tightroping across the Twin Towers.  Like, it's no big deal.  And there's pictures of it.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Yeah.  They have a historical site on Twitter.  They have, like, historical pics.  Right.  Oh, I love it.  I follow that.  It's great.  Yeah, I love looking at old pictures, especially of New York City.  They show guys, like, working, construction workers, and we've talked about it before,  just no safety harnesses, nothing.  Just hanging out.  Just walking on I-beams.  Nuts.  Oh, it just gives me this anxiety thing.  Like, I know Philippe Petit didn't fall, obviously, but as I'm looking at the pictures, 
[00:37:30]  I'm like, you're going to fall.  Oh, it's nerve-wracking.  It really is.  It's pretty amazing, though.  Yeah.  That whole story, it's too bad he's an asshole.  We didn't really like him, right?  No, not really.  But his story and how he accomplished that is just amazing.  How he shot an arrow from one tower to the next.  Yeah, to pull it.  With a line, and then they used that line to get a thicker line.  Yeah.  And then finally getting the tightrope across, and they had to secure it somewhere. 
[00:38:00]  They just had to figure out where they could secure it.  That's fucking good.  Imagine trying to get that done in this day and age.  Yeah, right.  You climb up to a building with a bow and arrow, and some sniper that's somewhere in  the city constantly will dispatch you.  I know it was a different time, but no one is questioning a guy coming into a building  with a lot of equipment.  Yeah.  Because that's a lot of equipment in the end.  Back then, no.  They just walked in with, they had to walk in with the tightrope.  Back then, no one gave a fucking shit.  I'm sure that was heavy.  Holy fuck. 
[00:38:30]  That's what I was seeing, and it gave me anxiety, and it's happening right now.  Oh, my God.  You have to just step out and go, all right, here I go.  Yeah, that's a frightening...  You know what scares me?  As much as his feet being on that wire is right behind him, the end of the building.  It's almost like...  Oh, my God.  You're not meant to be that close to where, like, this corner is.  There's a corner up there.  You're not meant to be there.  And then it's the bell bottoms he's wearing. 
[00:39:00]  Wouldn't that trip you?  Sporty bell bottoms.  I know they're kind of flutty.  Maybe they act like parachutes if he falls.  Like a cartoon.  But what bothers me about this picture is the bell bottoms, you can't see your fucking foot  as you're placing it on the tightrope.  At that point, if you're going between what was the World Trade Center, if you're going  between there, you're not at the point where you have to look at your feet anymore.  Yeah.  I think it's like a guitar player looking at his fingers the way he's putting them on the  fret.  Look at me.  I think at that point, he ain't looking at his feet anymore. 
[00:39:30]  Good point.  You imagine...  Very good point.  I'm sitting there like, well, he can't see his feet!  I would have to make sure I place my feet perfectly.  Yeah, you're right.  Can you imagine fucking being there, like, crawling across that wire, like hanging on  to it?  You couldn't do.  And then...  You couldn't even fucking get to the top there and peek over the edge, Jimmy.  And what sucks is they don't really have any real good video of this.  They have some video from the ground.  I know, right?  And at one point, he lays down... 
[00:40:00]  I know we've done this break, but it's worth repeating.  Iraq, have we?  Thumbs up from Iraq.  Iraq, he lays down in between the towers.  Oh, that's great.  On his back.  Fucking...  On his fucking back!  How do you get up from that?  Why doesn't he have video?  The camera broke or something?  It wasn't...  This is 77, I think, right?  Oh, it's 77, which, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you forget.  We now all have cameras.  You pull out your big black bell telephone.  Right.  Yeah.  Somebody's like, what are you doing with your phone?  He goes, I don't know, but years from now, it's going to mean something. 
[00:40:30]  No kidding.  If we see more pictures of that, this is a good color shot taken from...  He had just...  He's just starting out.  On the...  On the...  Oh, right.  Look at that one right there.  That one scares me.  Top right.  No, no, Sam, you had...  I'm sorry.  To the left there.  Uh-oh.  It's where he's sitting.  Where?  He's sitting.  Yeah.  Ah.  He is sitting...  Okay.  That one scares me.  Can you sit like that?  No.  Well, he's standing.  I'm sorry.  He's not sitting.  He's standing.  He's got his foot on the edge of the building, and he's on the very outside. 
[00:41:00]  Like, there's no safety harnesses or anything.  And he has hair like Alex in Clockwork Orange.  Yeah, he does.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I can't look at any of those pictures now, because I just think, oh my God, somebody did  see that and had to fucking jump.  And had to jump.  Off.  You can't look at World Trade Center pictures anymore without thinking, holy fuck, someone  had to see that.  Right.  They saw exactly that sight, and fucking jumped.  Right.  Yikes.  And they were looking across at the other building like that and seeing that perspective 
[00:41:30]  on it.  Yeah.  I think that's true.  Yeah.  Look at them in between.  Oh, boy.  There are a lot of pictures, though.  A lot of photos from up there.  What the fuck?  Do you know looking down how fucking crazy that would be?  That's just nuts.  He's just not scared of heights.  I mean.  And shit's just nuts.  He loved it.  Seeing the plane above him, too, must have been pretty.  Right.  Look at how tiny he is from the ground. 
[00:42:00]  He's just a dot in the middle of the towers.  That's odd.  They showed everyone in that picture, too.  See the jet flying over that?  Yeah.  That's kind of creepy.  Imagine if it fucking went right by him or something.  Yeah, Chip.  Was that a bad picture?  No.  Here.  I don't know.  It's old Bill Burr doing it.  It's old Bill Burr.  I don't think that's a real photo.  I think it's a painting.  No.  How would he get that?  Yeah, I don't think he...  He's got a GoPro on him. 
[00:42:30]  They didn't exist back then.  Oh, look at this.  Look at this.  I'm just going to kind of...  He's dangling.  He's standing one foot balanced on the edge of the building, on the very top corner,  with one foot sticking out, and he's just frolicking, playing.  No big deal for him.  That's crazy.  Wow.  I could just look at photos of this all day.  What an asshole.  There it is.  There's the one where he's laying down, Sam.  Oh.  To the right.  Yeah.  Oh, Sam.  He can't fucking...  That's not him.  Oh, it's not him?  He can't.  No.  Oh, no.  We saw a picture of him laying down, didn't we? 
[00:43:00]  I'm pretty sure, yeah.  It's out there somewhere.  Yeah, I did something similar.  No, you didn't.  I just wasn't high up.  I didn't fall.  I was in my yard.  But I'm like, I could have done that, but it was just be higher.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's very good, Chip.  I know.  Somebody said on Twitter, Chip is a bombing cunt today.  Today?  Yeah, but he's really bombing.  Tweet.  Fucking Twitter.  And then I walked around Brian Park yesterday because I had to wait for my wife. 
[00:43:30]  You should have went in.  Walked around Brian Park?  Oh.  Hey.  Nice.  That would suck.  Should have walked through it.  It's a lot of the park.  People always ask me for suggestions when they come to New York.  There you go.  Brian Park is pretty cool to check out.  Fuck.  And it's really close to here.  I had like an hour and a half to kill, so I was wandering around.  Mm-hmm.  And someone snapped me on Twitter wandering around from a distance.  That's always creepy.  From a distance.  Come up and say hi.  I don't fucking bite.  Yeah, he probably just was like, oh, there's Opie. 
[00:44:00]  Click.  And then I went to the public library, which is kind of in front of Brian Park on the other  side, and then I snapped Alec Baldwin with a tit monster.  Oh, my God.  You snapped him?  Huh?  You said you snapped him?  You vined him.  I vined him.  Oh.  So you did the same thing to Alec Baldwin that someone did to you?  You should have went up and said hello.  Oh, no.  No, it was pretty obvious he wasn't welcoming any visitors.  No?  But should be very funny. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, no.  It was very obvious you're not saying hi to Alec Baldwin.  He had a security guard very close.  Yeah.  And I was just sitting out front of the library, just killing time, looking at people.  One of my favorite things to do, just people watching.  All of a sudden, he strolls up, and everyone's looking like, what the fuck?  That's Alec Baldwin.  Is he laying down on the stairs?  Yes.  Yeah, he's doing something.  Why is that?  Well, the girl's laying down.  You see how he adjusted?  I think his scrotum was stuck to the side of his fucking leg.  He did a little adjustment in my six-second video. 
[00:45:00]  A little Baldwin ball bag.  Yes.  And there they are walking.  Yeah, there's people kind of taking pictures.  Yeah, those were all people going, holy fuck, that's Alec Baldwin.  That's his wife.  I got to get it.  Huh?  That's his wife.  Are you positive?  Because some people aren't sure.  I'm not saying that he was cheating on his wife.  It was obviously, they were obviously doing something there.  Yeah.  But I wasn't sure that was his wife or a model for something.  At the New York Public Library.  Is that where it was?  Yeah.  What are they doing?  I don't know.  They were just strolling around out front, and they had, it was very low-key. 
[00:45:30]  They had like two photographers and one security guard, and they walked around a little bit.  A lot of us idiots were fucking trying to snap pictures of him, and then he wandered off.  What goes on?  And then they just walked off into the city.  What goes on in public libraries these days?  It's just got to be fucking...  I don't know.  Is it empty?  Is it fucking...  I didn't even feel like going in.  Who the fuck is going to a library?  Are you allowed to even walk in these days?  I think you can during regular business hours.  Do you have to have one of those library cards, though, to get through the security, or can you just walk in? 
[00:46:00]  I think you could just walk right the fuck in.  I guess I should have walked in, just to see what the fuck's going on in there.  Yeah, what is going on in a...  In the great reading room.  I've not been in a library in Decades.  Right.  And I don't see any reason to need to go into a library.  No.  Who hangs out in the library?  What's that about?  Homeless people, I think.  Just people that are into old school shit?  Oh, certainly homeless and crazy people.  Yeah.  That's a given. 
[00:46:30]  But who else?  I guess historical libraries and stuff like that, where you could actually read a genuine fucking classic old book or something, if you're into that.  Right.  But your neighborhood library, what the fuck do they have that you can't access online?  I don't know.  That's a great question.  Some people just like the book.  I mean, there's still a whole generation of people that grew up reading books.  But the libraries are hanging in there way more than the actual bookstores, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know...  What have they got in there, fucking old people then? 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  Old people in the homeless?  How are they able to stay in business?  I don't know.  There's still a lot of people that go there to use the internet, too.  How does anyone...  Look, and I know...  Well, some people can't afford the...  Dude, when...  At this point, like, a computer's 20 bucks.  Even when I had no money, I was able to afford a good TV.  And definitely some kind of internet.  Yup.  Old people, though, I think, don't have computers.  So if they're like, my son, he told me to go on the computer to get my life called pendant. 
[00:47:30]  And then they gotta, like, go to the fucking...  Somewhere where there's a computer.  Right.  What is this Kinko's?  I need to print something to something.  I don't even know what it is.  I don't know.  Old people are fucking lost.  There's still people with dial-up, though, internet.  No, there's not.  There's not one person left with dial-up.  I assure you.  I assure you there is.  No, the last person moved over.  That's the thing.  That was it. 
[00:48:00]  Mom, did you just pick up the...  Put the phone.  It kicked me off.  Put the phone down there.  Goodbye.  Why?  That was the worst.  That goodbye when someone picked the extension up.  Yeah.  Who picked up the extension?  It was always the worst.  Always the worst.  I have to find a new number in my area.  This one sucks.  Oh, right.  The new number.  Meh, meh.  It's busy.  You have to go to...  They update all the numbers in different areas.  Then you have to scroll through that list and click.  Well, I'm done with this. 
[00:48:30]  I don't want to use up all my minutes.  So what I'm going to do is log off of AOL.  Well, goodbye.  Oh, AOL's updating for the next three hours.  It's going to update over my dial-up connection.  You need to pay per hour that you used AOL.  Yeah.  I don't remember that.  Yes.  You paid per hour.  How much was it?  There it is.  Good sound.  Remember that?  We're launching a fucking rocket ship.  And then when it finally went quiet, you're like, oh, I'm connected.  Right.  I'm in.  I'm in. 
[00:49:00]  I want to play those games.  All right.  Let's go look at the new pictures now.  Travis looked it up.  Three million AOL users still have dial-up.  No.  Three million.  No.  No.  I don't believe that.  There are areas.  People in rural areas might not have the fucking physical capability.  Satellite.  Fuck.  Three million people.  Come on.  No way.  You could just put a dish on your fucking roof and you're swinging the internet.  It's amazing.  A lot of people that don't have money.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't understand that.  I know.  I can't conceive of that.  Well, for them, the internet's just a place to shop or to go and talk to your friends. 
[00:49:30]  They're not looking at it like, I would know what Facebook's like on a dial-up.  Oh, my God.  Everything is so fucking content-oriented.  There's so much information.  How do they go over your phone line?  Are they still 56?  56.  Yeah.  Travis said it's listed in the last AOL earnings report about how many people are still using  their dial-up.  How many customers do they have, though?  That I'm not sure.  Can we check that?  Because I'm wondering how many percent that is.  I haven't checked AOL in... 
[00:50:00]  It has to be eight or nine years.  Years?  Has to be.  I still have an AOL account.  Do you check it?  I didn't duke it out to try to cancel it.  Huh?  I had to duke it out with the person to cancel it.  Why?  You call them on the phone, and they just will not cancel your fucking AOL account.  And I'm telling them, cancel it.  They're like, well, here's what we're going to do.  We'll let you keep it for three more months for free.  And I'm like, no!  Because then, after three months, they'll just start charging you again and keep it.  They didn't want to lose.  And they just kept going. 
[00:50:30]  And then they got to the point where they told me they can't cancel it.  Like, what?  Get the fuck out of here.  I think I wound up just canceling the credit card that I had it on and getting a new credit card so they couldn't...  That was the only way you could do it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Crazy.  It's crazy.  You know where there's evidence of that AOL thing?  What?  This week's podcast.  The Nugget.  Whoa.  It's the AOL customer service call.  Wow, that is a...  Where the guy couldn't cancel, right?  Yes.  Couldn't cancel.  We didn't even talk about this week's podcast that was uploaded yesterday. 
[00:51:00]  I'm trying to remember, we have the Jimmy, Ozzy, 18 pounds of books, birthday present, saga.  We did the whole thing.  And I'm trying to remember, we have Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer versus Anthony.  Versus Anthony.  There were a lot of...  Oh, yeah.  People liked that one.  It was a bit intense, but there were a lot of fucking jokes in there as well.  Yes.  And I know, Doc Gooden and David Lee Roth.  Yeah.  And some people love that David Lee Roth was a part of that interview. 
[00:51:30]  And certainly, there's a lot of people that hated it.  Right.  I'm in the camp of, I loved it.  Well, it was a very difficult time I went through.  I was...  I missed a lot of magic moments in my career and life due to drug abuse.  I was taking drugs when I...  We were taking drugs on the bus.  It was back in 84.  Did you love it?  It was some of the greatest moments we ever had.  Shoot me, dab a doob.  What the fuck, Dave? 
[00:52:00]  Did you love it or hate it?  I loved it.  You did, right?  Loved it.  In a weird way, I love it when the listeners get frustrated by stuff, too.  Especially Dave.  Right.  You know, Dave's...  The way he frustrates people is fantastic.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is, but...  First of all...  It would have been nice to have Doc Gooden without David Lee Roth, but...  Yeah, but...  Doc Gooden was a last second booking.  I've been there.  Booking.  Because he was sort of scheduled, and he wasn't, and then all of a sudden, Roland comes running  in some days and goes, look, we got blah, blah, and he's coming down the hall, and you 
[00:52:30]  just take him, obviously.  And we already had David Lee Roth booked, so what were we going to do, you know?  Here's another thing.  We made it work.  I don't care what year it is, what David Lee Roth has done or hasn't done of late, and  his successes and failures throughout his career and stuff like that.  That's fucking David Lee Roth, lead singer of Van Halen.  And if I ever thought, back in the day, that I would be sitting here...  Hanging with him.  Hanging out with the fucking guy as he's asking questions to Dwight Gooden. 
[00:53:00]  I know.  I'm just like, I'm not gonna...  What, am I gonna get mad?  Because some guy on Twitter's like, he wouldn't shut up!  Fuck you, it's David Lee Roth!  Yeah.  David Lee Roth and Doc Gooden.  They could do whatever the fuck they want.  Dude, come on.  Holy fuck.  That was an insane moment.  I never grew up from Long Island.  Yeah.  Fast forward a couple decades, and David Lee Roth is hanging and now says, look, anytime  you need me, I'm there for you guys.  I'll even fucking come in if you guys are on vacation.  I'll do your show for you. 
[00:53:30]  I saw him as a speck under a spotlight at the Nassau Coliseum.  Back in the day.  And it was an amazing show, and fucking the...  He was the fucking rock star.  I remember being in high school, you know, Van Halen albums, drinking, and then you fast  forward and he's hanging.  Big dopey headphones plugged in with the big quarter-inch jack into the record player.  Ah, at least I loved that shit.  Were you a Van Halen fan growing up at all? 
[00:54:00]  No, I was not.  I mean...  That first album was ridiculous.  Yeah, I know.  I've teased them a lot, in all honesty, and more than was genuinely my feelings.  Yeah, yeah.  I enjoyed them.  I was never a huge fan.  Believe me, I love teasing fucking David Lee Roth, too, and making jokes and everything.  We've made fun of them over the years.  But when you think about it, you know, grew up listening to that fucking guy as a rock  god.  And then there he is, sitting right there, asking dumb questions to Dwight Gooden.  But you know what's funny?  I think of this sometimes, too, like how much fun this gig is.  It's like...  Yeah.  I ask people, and I raise the issue of Ben Kingsley to somebody, and I'm like... 
[00:54:30]  It amazes me that I'm sitting there and I'm talking to him.  And in the real world, in entertainment, I have zero credibility with this guy.  Right.  There's nothing for him to say to me.  Other than yes, no, and walk away.  Right, right.  But in this moment, I ask questions, we ask questions.  They answer you.  I know.  It's the weirdest thing.  I know.  They have to.  It's the weirdest thing.  They have to answer you.  Dude, they have to.  Like, we did that with fucking Harvey Weinstein when he was in.  You weren't here that day, I think. 
[00:55:00]  Remember when Harvey Weinstein came in?  He's the fucking head of Miramax.  In...  I don't get in the room with Harvey Weinstein alone.  No.  Never.  Ever.  But in this situation, you see them in a weird way where they want you to  be nice to them.  Yes.  And they're a little nervous.  And they're like, yeah, yeah.  They're happy.  You're having fun to get...  It's like, anywhere outside of this room, and you ask them even close to what you ask  them here, security takes you away.  Or they just dominate you somehow.  Right, right.  They give you one quick answer. 
[00:55:30]  And then blow you off.  Or they're in charge.  Oh, that's the way.  Whatever.  What I find fascinating is, you know, a lot of these guys, as soon as the mics go off,  they're out of here.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's all business.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But when you get the guy that all of a sudden the mics are off, and you're like, okay, that's  it.  The interview's over.  And the commercials start.  And they just hang out.  They hang out.  And ask, like, personal questions.  Hang out, yeah.  What?  Like, Ron Howard did that.  Remember the day?  They're like, he's got to go.  He's got to go.  So we wrap up the interview.  And all of a sudden, he hung out during the whole commercial break. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  And he's interested in what we've been up to, and he's very aware of our show and satellite  radio in general, and he was talking about the channels he likes here, and I'm sitting  here going, he doesn't have to do this.  He's a big A-lister.  Yeah.  And he's still hanging.  People get this weird impression that, like, we must know what we're doing if we're interviewing  these people.  And it's like, no, this week, I find it as odd as anyone else would that we're getting  actual, you know, having an audience with these people. 
[00:56:30]  I said to Sharon, because Florentine came to the Sabbath town hall, and at the end of  it, Sharon was so fucking nice.  And I'm talking to her and Jim and Jim's brother.  And we were just talking, because Jim's brother had introduced Jim to Sabbath back in the 70s.  So they were talking about that.  And I said, I remember, I used to call England, and I said this to Sharon, I used to call Jet  Records in England and tell them I wanted to meet Ozzy.  This is 1981.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  We know who you are.  You'd call them?  But I would call this record label in England and go, like, what can I do to meet Ozzy? 
[00:57:00]  It was like this weird...  Wow.  Oh, wow.  That is fucking...  Yeah, man.  This is, I was 13, living with my parents.  Aw.  That's adorable.  And you needed to talk to Ozzy.  Yeah, I just wanted to meet him.  And now you talk to Ozzy.  But I mean, that's...  How weird is that?  But they answer you, and they come in, and they see you.  It's such a weird thing when you're set up to interview people, and they have to answer  you.  You have to answer me.  You think there's a bigger Ozzy fan than you out there somewhere?  There might be.  I mean...  I don't know.  You're on the short list, though.  There might be some of that might be bigger than you.  Yeah, there's guys with tattoos and stuff. 
[00:57:30]  But there's a lot of people that love them as much as I do, sure.  But I'm just in a very lucky position where I've gotten to know them a little bit, especially  Sharon.  And they know you're going to be good to them, and they trust you.  And that's where the very lucky part comes in.  They do like loyalty.  She wrote me a very nice email afterwards.  The band was thrilled with it.  Please leave my husband alone.  I'm confused when I hear you talk.  Who's you and who's Ozzy?  You sound just like him.  Talk like yourself, will you, you little worm?  You little sushi worm. 
[00:58:00]  So, yeah.  Ah, shit.  Very cool.  Why don't we take a break?  So, Scott Thorson's coming in here.  Yeah, he's out with Dennis.  Dennis on the Bunny Ranch knows how to fucking...  He's a genius, man.  And he's one of those guys who just understands how to be fucking relevant and in the spotlight.  And he's got Scott Thorson out doing interviews.  So, he's taking them around?  Yeah.  Well, he dropped like 15 grand to get him out of jail.  Is that what he did?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Why was he in jail?  I don't remember.  We'll have to get into that with him. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  I want to say...  So, he needed someone to bail him out.  And here comes Dennis Hoff.  Dennis Hoff comes.  But he's like, I'll bail you out.  But then we're going to fucking do some interviews.  I'm putting you on the road, motherfucker.  We're going to do some things.  Yep.  He paid $15,000.  No kidding.  Got him out of jail.  And now he's got him on the whole press tour.  And he's walking around.  He's also got one of his Bunny Ranch girls with him the whole time.  I dress him in one of those...  In that chauffeur outfit from the movie.  And have him drive me around.  Here's Scott.  Isn't he great?  And ladies and gentlemen, this is Scott.  My friend Scott.  Isn't he wonderful? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Isn't he wonderful?  He's from a small town.  Yes.  Do you like the car?  Do you like...  Oh, God.  You need acceptance, douche.  Yeah, I have a long, long stole.  Yeah.  It's great, isn't it?  It's just something I put on this morning.  Isn't it wonderful, though?  It's great, isn't it?  Here's my penis pump.  Isn't it wonderful?  Oh, my God.  You got him down.  It's fucking great. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh, Liberace.  Yeah.  Hey, Liberace, why don't you go over there and jiggle a few piano keys or something?  We know what you're doing.  So, Club Soda Kenny was on Inside Amy.  Yeah.  Amy Schumer's show for Comedy Central.  Inside Amy Schumer.  Huh?  Inside Amy Schumer.  Oh, yeah.  And, obviously, the show's great, and a lot of the guys that we know and love, including  people in this room, are on the show.  Everybody was on the one episode.  It was amazing.  They got rid of us all in one. 
[01:00:00]  It was a star-studded episode with Bob Kelly and Jim Norton playing massage therapist, and  you had Florentine in there, and Kurt Mesker, who's done our show, and Joe DeRosa.  You know what?  Joe DeRosa was fucking really good.  He played, and he's always angry in everything he does, but he was playing an angry cop that  was looking through the mirror at somebody that was being interrogated.  He does that so well, because I think he's just pissed naturally, so it really comes across.  So, he wasn't really acting.  Yeah.  He pulled it off, though.  It was very funny. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  And Club Soda Kenny had a big moment on Inside Amy Schumer, and it works as an audio  a bit, too, so we're going to play it here.  Oh, good.  I haven't seen this.  Huh?  I haven't seen it.  Oh, it's great.  Amy Schumer interviews Club Soda Kenny as we go to break.  So, Kenny, you are an ex-cop, and you're now a bodyguard.  Correct.  I know you because I used to open for Jim Norton, and you are right now his bodyguard.  Yeah.  How long were you in the force? 
[01:01:00]  I was a cop for 25 years.  I was a correctional officer before that in a state prison.  What prison?  The same prison where Stallone filmed Lockup.  Why are you saying that?  Like, it's so cool.  Like, who cares?  Do you have a gun right away?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You go to the police academy, graduate.  They give you a gun and a badge.  I mean, are there some just, like, straight-up retards in the academy that you can't even  believe they have a gun?  Um, there's an interesting group of people.  Okay.  I'm going to name three races.  You tell me who did it. 
[01:01:30]  Okay?  Okay.  If it's like a Jewish guy, half, he's half Jewish, half Latino.  Then one guy is half Irish, half Puerto Rican.  And then the other guy is black.  Who did it?  The guilty person.  It was the Jewish guy.  I don't, you know, I need to know the facts before I act.  I just gave you the facts.  Okay.  It was a Jew.  Okay.  Um, if I were to want to become a cop, how long would it take me from today to when I 
[01:02:00]  got a gun?  What?  You got to pass the background investigation.  Do you know my priors?  Shoplifting, right?  Yeah.  Can I have a felony?  No.  No, no crimes and moral turpitude.  Crime and moral turpitude?  Yeah.  What's something that people should know about cops that they don't?  Well, I don't know.  It's a thankless job.  A lot of people don't realize that.  Everybody loves firemen.  They hate cops.  What about you?  Do you love firemen?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't do fire.  I'm scared of fire.  What are you scared of?  I don't like scary movies.  I mean, I remember one time, you know that movie Seven? 
[01:02:30]  I do know that movie.  That's not a scary movie.  That's just like an action movie.  And I remember I watched it, you know, on my night off by myself one night.  And afterwards, I had to take my dog out for a walk.  And I had to bring my gun and a flashlight.  And then once I was out there walking my dog, I was mad at myself.  I didn't bring my big gun.  So on your night off, do you usually just watch a Brad Pitt movie by yourself?  That was back in 1995.  He was hot then.  He was hot then.  You know who would play a great fireman? 
[01:03:00]  Who?  Brad Pitt.  Brad Pitt.  That's right.  How many Asian guys have you ever arrested?  You never kept track of the Asians?  No.  I like their food.  How often do you say the N-word?  I've used it on occasion.  Oh my God, Kenny.  Denzel.  What about Denzel?  Got an Academy Award in Training Day for using that word.  Okay.  But you were not in that movie.  And you are not Denzel. 
[01:03:30]  Exactly.  Kenny.  What?  If you were trapped on a desert island with one actor, who would it be?  You.  No, it has to be a guy.  If you were a guy.  Why?  Why a guy?  That's the game.  I don't play games.  Oh my God.  Have you ever seen Benjamin Button?  That movie with Brad Pitt?  Oh, I didn't remember if Brad Pitt was in it, but you obviously did.  Yeah, isn't that when he's like, goes from old to young? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Did you, at the end of the movie, was that your favorite part?  I've seen it.  But I've seen The Tree of Life.  What are your main jobs as a bodyguard?  Well, I got a couple main clients now.  I work for the Opie and Anthony radio show every morning.  And I travel with a comedian now, Jim Norton.  What happens if, as a bodyguard, you call in sick?  Are you just like, sorry, good luck out there?  Luckily, I never get incapacitated. 
[01:04:30]  You know, and if I get the sniffles, I just deal with it.  You get the sniffles?  Yeah.  And even when I was a cop, like, I had a very good attendance record.  If you're not early, you're not on time.  You're so awful.  All right.  Thank you so much for coming in.  It was an honor.  Thank you.  If you're on time, you're late.  Thank you.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:05:00]  Mysterious XM.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers.  Because we're as cold as the ice road truckers.  And when we come to your town, the shit goes down.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies. 
[01:05:30]  Bucket up your tree.  See, told you we had sponsors.  And now, back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Just ran into our old pal Dennis Hoff in the hallway.  He said, this Scott Thorson's ready to go. 
[01:06:00]  Is he here yet, Scott, or no?  Is it just Dennis?  I don't know.  Maybe they're waiting for him, because I didn't see...  I just heard Roland say he's here.  He is, okay.  So they'll be in in a few minutes.  And then a little later, Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo is on his way in.  Probably trying to beat the storm.  What is it?  El...  El...  El...  El Chippo.  El Chippo is on its way.  Yeah.  Hey, trees.  How many millibars are we talking here? 
[01:06:30]  Chad.  How many millibars is this storm?  Chad, just get to the...  I'm trying.  If you will, let me talk, Harold.  And then he just goes into this long-winded fucking bullshit.  Right.  Of fucking millibars.  El Doracho.  I've been around for a while.  I've never heard of El Doracho, as far as a weather thing goes.  And, you know...  What is it?  A bunch of cells getting together?  Super cells.  I'll take the soup.  A lot of lightning. 
[01:07:00]  A lot of rain.  What's going on?  Yeah.  I don't know what an El Doracho is.  Here comes Dennis.  El Doracho.  Crazy.  Oh, my God.  That's going to get great.  How are you?  Well, look what we got here.  He just said, here comes Dennis Hoff.  I'm like, Dennis, you look great.  Well, I really have figured out that operation, Dennis.  How you doing?  Hey, Dennis Hoff.  Take a seat right there.  Scott Thorson.  How are you?  Scott, how you doing?  You kind of look like Liberace.  That's creepy.  Hello. 
[01:07:30]  That's kind of creepy.  What's up, Dennis?  What do you want the young lady?  You want her on the couch for now?  What do you want?  Phone's off.  Chrissy, come on.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  Hello.  She's the reason he got out of jail.  What do you mean?  Oh, yeah?  She saw the show and had some compassion.  Oh, yeah?  I had a little compassion.  Wait, I'm very confused.  So Scott Thorson was in jail recently for what?  For being a bad boy.  Oh, boy.  Basically drugs, messing around with some credit cards and stuff. 
[01:08:00]  Your credit card thing's going on.  Eh, what are you going to do?  Eh, you know.  It happens.  Right, Scott?  Good, man.  It happens every day.  Yeah, have fun.  She's a University of Michigan cheerleader.  Yeah, huh?  Just joined us.  Yeah, I graduated a year ago.  You graduated a year ago from the University of Michigan?  Yes.  Hi, Scott.  We got to get a mic on.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  We need a mic on.  We need to get a mic on there.  Huh?  The reason why you put parental controls on your TV.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, if you have a daughter and you don't want to work on for Dennis, just block HBO. 
[01:08:30]  Block HBO.  Oh, so you saw the HBO show?  Yes.  At 15.  At 15?  At 15 years old.  You know what?  It had a lot of sex in it, but I was a fan of the storyline.  Oh, yeah.  It had a good storyline.  I read the magazine for the articles.  No, it really did have a good storyline.  Like, the Menage a Trois episode was a really good episode.  It's a hell of a storyline, right?  Could someone get Scott's mic done here?  It's like Liberace's dick. 
[01:09:00]  It needs a pump up.  Exactly.  It keeps going lip in front of your face there.  Well, Scott, this is uncensored, so you can say whatever you will find, and you can say  what you want.  Feel free.  I mean, you can say...  Wait, I need to know.  So, Scott Dorsen's in jail, and then you were the one that got to Dennis Hoff to get  him, to bail him out?  Yeah, Suzanne and I saw the movie, and we felt bad for him.  Let's go rescue this guy.  And then they came to me the next morning and said, we've got to play Captain Save Liberace's 
[01:09:30]  Lover.  Right, right.  And I'm like, no.  And then, next thing you know, she's blowing me.  Oh!  And I'm saying yes.  He's like, okay, I'll save him.  I'll save him.  That's a great way to convince the guy.  I'll look into it.  He said yes, sorry to the way.  It wasn't too hard to convince him.  So, I hire David Houston, who keeps Joe Francis out of jail.  He's not doing a good job right now.  No, not right now.  So, we checked into it and said, you know what, if it was anybody else, he probably wouldn't  have been in jail. 
[01:10:00]  And the bottom line is, he's a guy that's been hooked up with Liberace.  Liberace and him were fucking for years and years, and he got into a lot of drugs, and  I mean, like a pound of cocaine at a time, I mean, that kind of stuff.  Wow.  So, we Skyped him, and we decided to take the risk, and it's a wise investment.  Yeah.  I think you owe all the money.  He had the money.  Yeah, we loved it.  The movie's amazing, isn't it?  Yeah, what did you think?  Did you think of Matt Damon playing you?  I thought he was fantastic. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, you're happy?  Yeah.  Very happy.  The movie's number one.  It's the number one movie since 2004.  It's the...  Freight Spiel.  Yeah.  Freight Spiel.  Oh, that's a crazy number.  What do you think about Matt Damon pounding Mike Douglas?  Wow.  I'm a fan of both.  I like them more now.  I thought that was great.  Is that how you gave him a pounding, huh?  Catherine's got to be jealous.  Was there anything like what you did in Liberace?  Well, I didn't do it quite that hard.  He was a little older, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Half the time. 
[01:11:00]  Was that true, though?  Was he really like...  Because that might have saved your life.  Like, the fact that he wanted...  You wanted to fuck him, and you didn't want him to fuck...  Yeah.  I didn't.  He didn't fuck me, and I didn't fuck him.  Oh, you didn't fuck him.  He blew you, though, right?  He blew me.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  What?  Oh, man.  You weren't having anal sex with him?  I thought you were.  You were the giver.  I think just once.  Oh, they copped her once.  No, just once.  But it was always protective sex, and I think that's the reason why I was alive.  But he blew me. 
[01:11:30]  I never blew him, though.  You never blew him?  Oh, man.  You never blew Liberace?  No.  Come on.  What kind of a friend are you?  He had an ugly cock.  It was full of recalled silicone.  Was it?  He silicone-ed his dick up?  Yeah.  And it was all lumpy, and he was uncut, and it was ugly.  Wow.  Uncut, lumpy, silicone cock, and he couldn't get it hard.  Oh, damn.  Because of all the silicone.  Wow.  Wait a minute. 
[01:12:00]  How big was it lengthwise?  Oh, my gosh.  About that long.  No.  Was he really that long?  Yeah, he was big.  Are you serious?  But he was Italian.  You know what they used to do?  And the heck, they did this to Jabba, I think, when Ron put him in that movie.  But he wasn't bigger than me, though.  They cut that muscle.  They cut the muscle so it just kind of hangs.  Under the vein.  It gets a lot longer.  Well, don't they pull it out a little bit more, too?  You got a little extra in there?  It makes it longer.  Then they shoot it up with silicone.  You cut the ten, and then you can pull it actually out to make it longer.  Yeah, like John Baba.  But when they shot him up with all the stuff, it looked like a lumpy Red Bull cam. 
[01:12:30]  Man.  Now it's easier.  You can use the cot pumps.  They work great.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they do work.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Dick pump works.  But his dick was long and silicone and lumpy, which meant that it wasn't silicone properly.  Yeah, and uncut.  Oh, you don't like uncut?  No, no.  He is ugly.  Lee's ugly dick.  When you can't pull the skin away from the head, yuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, GMI, Scott.  No, no.  That's phenomenal information. 
[01:13:00]  Just enough information.  That's J-E-I, yeah.  Just enough information.  Perfect.  I hope Weintraub isn't listening to this.  So you and Christy can compare cock stories.  I hope Weintraub's eating breakfast right now while I'm listening to this.  So he would suck your dick.  And what would you do while you're sucking your dick?  Just think of somebody else?  Or would you just close and fantasize?  Would you really not?  You never fucked him?  Come on.  Never once?  Just once?  I think once I started to, and I didn't like it.  What did you like about it?  Oh, he was only 16 years old.  Come on.  Oh, you were that young? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I was young.  How did he get off then?  Like, what was in it for him?  I guess he just jerked.  Yeah.  He had one of those bags that he would use.  One day I caught him using it, you know, when he came in.  What's the bag?  And he quick pulled it up and threw it in the drawer.  I didn't know it was a pump bag, and he was sitting there pumping it.  And I was watching.  He didn't know I came in.  I was watching.  That's when he had his wig off, and he threw it over the shower.  Imagine getting picked up by Liberace with your 16. 
[01:14:00]  I've got to tell you a funny story.  Please.  He flushed an ounce of my cocaine, right?  And I got so fucking pissed off that I chased him down.  Now, this house is 17,000 square feet.  Anyway, he was running for, and I really didn't mean to, but I grabbed him by the back of the  hair, and I pulled the wig off.  And he said, oh, Scott, you're such a bad boy.  There he is.  You've got this wig in your hand, and he's just bald.  But why did he flush your cocaine? 
[01:14:30]  Because he didn't want me to have it.  He said that he created the monster.  And there's a great story in the film, too, where you guys did.  Would he really go into, like, buddy booths and stuff like that, and these peep shows when  he had all this fame?  Yeah, he would.  And you would think he wouldn't do that, you know, and do these gay things.  Because he was always, one day we were sitting in the dressing room, he goes, Scott, you  really think I'm gay?  Or do you think the people think I'm gay?  And I said, how many guys walk out on stage with 115 pounds of pink ostrich? 
[01:15:00]  He was just too busy to find the right girl.  Yeah, that was it.  It was always odd when he went on, like, the talk shows and stuff, and they're just like,  well, Lee, you know, you find the right lady yet?  Now I'm still looking.  And it's like, anybody in their right mind would be, all right, you know.  The women of America believed it.  Like, my mom believed it.  Yeah, a lot of ladies did.  A lot of ladies did, yeah.  Yeah, they believed that.  I busted their bubble, didn't I?  Yeah, you certainly did. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, with a fucking hammer.  Hammer him, hammer, pound him.  What did you say?  You used to what?  You used to what?  You used to do something with him?  An impression?  What was I going to say?  Oh, you used to sound like a...  Something impression.  Yeah, well, you know, when he cut me off.  And threw me out.  Which was after how long?  Four years?  No, it was longer than that.  Oh, yeah.  It was longer than that.  I don't know where they get that five years from.  I don't understand that.  Well, how many years was it?  Well, we lived together for about eight, and then there was a relationship on and off for 17 years. 
[01:16:00]  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Okay, yeah.  But anyway, he cut me off of the credit cards, so, you know, he took all the credit cards away.  They stopped everything, my checks, the whole works.  So, the only thing I could do was I could imitate his voice perfectly.  And I knew all the stores where he had accounts, and I'd say, hi, this is Lee.  Would you please send Scott something?  And I'd load up with furniture and plants, liquor stores, you name it. 
[01:16:30]  You know, and it worked.  Why did he cut you off after 17 years?  Well, because, well, you know, let's face it.  Okay, I was 16 years old.  You were getting too old for him.  No, I think what happened was he ordered the doctor to put me on the drugs, and the doctor did it.  Cocaine, pharmaceutical cocaine.  And then when it got out of control, he said that he created a monster.  So, he just threw all my things that he had his manager, Seymour Heller of the Hatchet Man, I call him that.  Dan Aykroyd plays him. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was good.  Throws myself off the balcony and discards me like I was some piece of trick.  He didn't even offer me rehab.  Wow, yeah.  So, you, then the film was fairly accurate.  Oh, yeah, then I sued him for palimony.  I'm the grad Danny of palimony.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  This guy's, think of this, he's a master.  He grabs a 16-year-old kid, and to clean up his homosexuality, he has him go get an operation on his face to look like Liberace, and he adopted him. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, yeah, that is a weird fucking storyline there.  To throw the press off.  So, he wanted, then, to assume that perhaps you were his son in some way, shape, or form?  Well, yeah.  That's the whole idea.  It's to throw, you know, this is my son.  You know, here I'm wearing, you know, $2 million worth of jewelry.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, have 32 cars and all these furs, you know, so what he did was, he threw the press off, and he says, this is my son, Scott. 
[01:18:00]  Jesus.  And, uh, were you sleeping with other people at the time, and was he, or were you?  No, just Michael Jackson, you know.  Now, did you really sleep with Michael Jackson?  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Well, uh, I met Michael in the mid-70s, and, uh, I was introduced to him by Liberace, and, uh, we just had a great relationship.  Lee and I broke up in 82.  So, I, Michael asked if I would come and work for him. 
[01:18:30]  Huh.  So, this is when he was breaking up with the Jacksons, you know, his brothers, and he went solo.  And this is when Thriller came in, and then we went to Europe, and we did Say Say with Paul McCartney, Big Hat, Hit, and all that.  And we just hit it off.  Michael fell in love with me.  I was a pretty boy back then.  Were you the giver or the getter there?  No, he was the giver.  Michael was?  Michael was, yeah.  He was the giver?  Yeah.  I was very, you know something, and I'm glad that I was that way because of the AIDS epidemic back then. 
[01:19:00]  I mean, it was bad.  You know, Rock Hudson, and, you know, I saw Rock a week before he died.  Lee and I went over to see him.  Because Rock and him used to fool around years ago.  Oh, boy.  And then they'd have all the sex parties over there.  Boy.  Boy, boy, boys.  How long did you know Michael before it became sexual or became apparent that he wanted to be sexual with you?  Well, it wasn't until 82, and then we were together until about 85. 
[01:19:30]  And then when he started getting really big, he decided that, well, we better cool this.  And then I went my way.  Did you guys do a family road trip with plastic surgery or something?  Oh, yeah.  I've got to tell you the funny story.  LaVarache had a full facelift.  I had my cheek implants and the chin.  Michael wants to get his nose done.  No, excuse me.  I'll back up.  I had gotten my nose done, and Michael loved it. 
[01:20:00]  And he hated his nose because it was white and looked like Joseph.  He reminded him of his father.  And Michael didn't have a good relationship with Joseph.  So all three of us are bandaged up in the backseat of the limo Rolls Royce that Lee drives on stage,  going to Palm Springs, and then that crazy doctor, which Rob Lowe calls.  Right, right.  That was great.  We're shooting us up full of Demerong and pharmaceutical cocaine and bifetamines.  And this is how Michael starts his plastic surgery and starts the drug addiction by pharmaceutical drugs. 
[01:20:30]  Wait, can I ask about the Michael Jackson thing?  Did the family ever try to sue you or anything?  Because obviously...  Well, let me tell you.  When I released this article in 2004, Alan Butterfield, the editor of the National Enquirer,  flew in two experts, ex-FBI agents, and did polygraph tests. 
[01:21:00]  I mean, I passed two polygraph tests.  One was offered to Michael because they were protesting on it.  Michael refused to do it.  The Jacksons have never come after me.  Now, of course, they say, well, oh, no, it's not true.  But, I mean, I've never been sued.  I did hear from the attorneys in the beginning, and then they backed off once, you know, the lie detectors came in.  And then when Michael refused, they told Michael not to do it, obviously, because Michael, it was true. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  And this goes way back.  You know, Liberace called me a fucking liar, a disgruntled employee.  I was a hustler.  I was a porn star.  I walked off the streets of Hollywood.  And I had, you know, I was nothing but a liar.  They even paid my brother, Wayne, who passed away, my half-brother, over $20,000 to testify and make up stories about me.  And, you know, they were just a piece of shit back then. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  I got one more question.  What do you think of Michael and the kid thing?  Your opinion.  Yeah, it's not.  Those aren't Michael's kids.  No, no, no.  No, no, Michael with the allegations.  Oh, no, no.  Michael didn't do that.  See, a lot of people say that it was just that he never really grew up and just felt more comfortable hanging out with younger people.  Michael would never do that.  He was acquitted for it.  And it was this kid, the kid, I forget the kid's name, but the uncle is the one that, you know, got the $20 million from Michael. 
[01:22:30]  And so Michael decided, and this came right from Michael, he was afraid, so he paid this guy $20 million because he was going to expose him.  Expose him as?  As a child molester.  So Michael paid him off.  But if Michael wasn't a molester, what was he scared of?  Well, he didn't want the bad publicity. 
[01:23:00]  Because that's just like Liberace didn't want the bad publicity about me being 16 years old.  And, you know, we settled out of court and all that.  Oh, you did settle?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm surprised he didn't.  Today you go to prison.  I mean, cocaine, bang on a 16-year-old.  How about you go to jail for a while?  Well, you know, here's the funny thing about, you know, I go to trial or I go to sentencing July 3rd.  And David Houston, my attorney, thankful to Mr. Huff here, the best criminal attorney there is, had a two-and-a-half-hour meeting with the prosecutors. 
[01:23:30]  And that was the time when I had Entertainment Tonight come into the jail and they interviewed me.  And we talked about, and then I broke up.  I got very emotional about it.  But they feel that I'm a victim, too.  And they said to Mr. Houston that, you know, Scott doesn't deserve to go to prison.  What was it that scared you or got you emotional? 
[01:24:00]  Like, what would they just...  Well, I think part of, you know, when you...  I don't think anybody sets out to be an addict in life.  You know, and then you normally do things that you would not do.  And, again, I apologize for what happened in Reno.  And I apologize to the courts and the prosecutors.  And whatever the expenses are, the court fees I will pay.  And make my apology to Judge...  You know what?  I'm having a hard time getting my head around Michael being a giver.  Yeah, that was. 
[01:24:30]  That really did sound a little...  You know, give me this again.  Michael was the giver.  Yeah, he was.  Seriously.  He wasn't...  He was more of a top than a bottom.  That is an odd thing.  That struck me as odd, too.  I figured he'd be a wimpy little...  I know.  I have to change everything I think of now when I jerk off.  But, I mean, he got into oral sex and all that.  But, I mean, he had a crush on me.  I mean, I was young.  And then I got all the pictures to back it up when Michael and I were at Lord Montague's 
[01:25:00]  and, you know, at Buckingham Palace.  And I'll tell you a funny thing that Michael and I did.  You know, outside the Queens, you know, in the castle, these guards stand straight.  They're not supposed to move.  Yeah.  So what we did was we kept putting a...  Well, we put about five grand on the bayonets and we kept loading it up with money and pounds  and all that.  And we said, now, you can keep this, but we need a picture.  And sure enough, he moved and he grabbed the money.  You're not supposed to do that.  And I sold it to the National Enquirer for ten grand, too. 
[01:25:30]  So I got back the money.  Were you guys like gay swingers?  Were you partying with other people?  Yeah, Ziegfrey and Roy.  Big sex parties.  Rock Hudson.  Yeah.  Larry Gatlin.  Loretta Lynn.  Larry Gatlin.  I had a fling with Loretta Lynn, too.  Really?  She loved to smoke pot back then.  Yeah.  And she got me so fucked up in the...  She was playing the Riviera. 
[01:26:00]  I think it was 79 or 80.  I forget what year it was.  But I like Loretta.  You know, the queen of country.  Well, was she good?  Yeah, I liked it.  Was Michael good?  No, he had a small dick.  Did he really?  So Liberace and Michael were both bad in bed.  Liberace and Michael were both bad in bed.  Yeah, well, I wasn't really into it then.  You know, I was, you know...  Which one was more of a kisser?  Liberace or Michael?  Well, I wouldn't let them kiss me.  You guys had a pretty good make-out scene in the movie, though. 
[01:26:30]  Huh?  You guys had a pretty good make-out scene in the movie.  Oh, there was...  Yeah.  Come on.  You never made out with Liberace?  You had to have it in 17 years.  And if so, was he a good kisser?  No, I wouldn't.  No, I didn't.  He didn't tongue me.  No, huh?  Jesus.  Not even text every now and then?  You know, I was more straight-laced, you know.  I said, well, figure out.  You know, he can blow me.  And then, you know, all those and these and Rolls Royces and all that.  God.  You know, I've got a $10 million cock. 
[01:27:00]  It's been a lot of places.  Hey, listen.  Listen.  It's made me a good living.  Apparently so.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a...  But, so, no kissing.  When you guys would go out, would he take you out?  And would you be, like, a couple in public?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How would that explain?  Well, he dressed me.  I mean, he was really weird.  Oh, the sun thing again.  The guy before me, Vince Cardell.  Right.  Same costume.  He designed piano ring, candelabra ring. 
[01:27:30]  The same thing.  I mean, he...  And then the same thing with me.  What about cock rings?  With the furs.  Oh, yeah.  Rhinestone cock rings.  Can you imagine trying to get on swallowing one of those?  Boy, I said he took you out as a son.  Or as a couple.  No, it was...  He wanted me strictly for a lover.  But, again, the reason why he said son... 
[01:28:00]  Well, he did say...  He says, well, you're always the son that I've always wanted.  But we...  You know, there were good times.  There were bad times.  For the most part, you know, he was so fucked up because he grew up in the age where, you  know, homosexuality would have ruined his career.  You know, let's face it, from 50 to 59, he had the number one show.  He beat I Love Lucy was the number one.  She had the best ratings and he beat her.  Wow.  So you're talking he came up in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. 
[01:28:30]  Big star over 40 years.  You know, being this huge, huge legend, Mr. Showmanship.  It would have ruined his career.  The same thing...  Look what rock went through.  You know, that was a very well-kept secret in Hollywood.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that would have...  I mean, can you imagine...  They just didn't talk back then.  No, they didn't.  No.  That's the answer to your question.  The media, they had to have known, but they...  Well, they did.  It was a different time.  It was a different time.  Don't forget, sued the press in London and won a big judgment.  And now, here's the funny thing. 
[01:29:00]  I think it was the Daily Mirror or something.  Right.  I forget what it was.  They want to sue the estate now because they found out that he was gay and AIDS and all that,  and he lied, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  These guys were poster boys for NAMBLA.  Yeah.  With a mention.  I mean, think about it, right?  Yeah, I mean, that is a little bit...  Now, if you fucked a 16-year-old...  Oh, God.  You're gone.  You're finished.  Right.  You're gone. 
[01:29:30]  It's amazing how...  And that's what the district attorney, she says, you know, Mr. Thorson doesn't deserve prison.  And she really was upset when she saw and what I went through and all that.  Hmm.  You know, because Liberace is very well-respected in Nevada.  Everybody loved him.  And now...  A lot of money.  A lot.  Yeah.  Now, well, he brought in all the high rollers.  Sure.  And now, you know, it's funny how...  I'm a strong believer in karma, how everything is coming around, because back then I was 
[01:30:00]  this liar, this disgruntled employee, and now the whole world has taken my side on this.  The movie is number one.  Yeah, it's true.  My book is number five on the New York Times bestseller list.  Every European country has picked it up now, including Hong Kong and Japan.  They predict it to win the best foreign film, which is equivalent to the Oscar here.  And they expect it to win the Emmy here, and then Douglas. 
[01:30:30]  And in the makeup, look at Debbie Reynolds.  You never recognized her playing Frances Liberace.  Right.  I mean, it was...  This is the highest-rated movie.  HBO's done since 2004.  It was very anticipated.  People...  When it came out, people wanted to see it.  The movie theaters in America didn't have the balls to do this.  They all said, we're not buying this.  And now it comes out, and now it's going to be in the movie theaters around the world.  Oh, it will.  Yeah, yeah.  So is that going to change the mentality in America?  Sure. 
[01:31:00]  I bet you got us a gift.  Hey, Scott.  You got us a gift?  Yeah.  What did you bring us?  Well, you have a gift, Opie.  Ooh.  Scott, about your book, as you open that up, did you write about Michael Jackson in the book?  No, I'm saving it for...  We're having...  The next book is going to be called Beyond the Candelabra.  It'll be out in about six to eight weeks.  It'll be all the stuff that happened to you.  You can tell whether Larry Gatler was a top or a bottom.  I didn't want to know that.  It is amazing how that...  I really wanted to know about Michael Jackson's penis.  Oh, thanks, man. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you.  It looks like he'd be small, though.  Yeah, absolutely.  Take one and pass it down.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  I only bought three guys, so you guys got to fight over it.  The book is called Behind the Candelabra, My Life with Liberace, and it's by Scott, and  there's a new afterword written by Scott.  Wow, that's just great, man.  Man, they really did.  Here's stuff that's not in there, though, that's going to make the new book.  Scott was involved in the Wonderland murders.  Right, right, yeah. 
[01:32:00]  That's the John Holmes thing.  Yeah, and then I got gunned down and shot, the contract placed.  I mean, I was shot five times.  Let's go with Wonderland.  You knew John Holmes, or you were there with John?  I knew him all.  Well, here's what happened.  In 81, I took some of my money and I invested it with Nash, because he owned a bunch of nightclubs.  Eddie Nash.  Yeah, so he owned like 15 Kit Kat clubs, you know where the girls would come down in the  cage, the strippers.  And then the Club Hollywood stars, Starwood, Seven Seas Club Hollywood, The Odyssey. 
[01:32:30]  Anyway, to make a long story short, is that Holmes, we would party with Holmes up there  at Nash's place.  Nash hooks Holmes on crack cocaine.  The plastic surgeon, my plastic surgeon, or Liberace's plastic surgeon, shoots himself in the head.  Wait, the Rob Lowe character shot himself?  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  So I needed a new drug supplier. 
[01:33:00]  Well, Nash brought in all the heroin, cocaine, plus he had Mayor Bradley, Tom Bradley, on his  payroll.  A couple of DEA agents.  Anyway, Holmes sets up the robbery, leaves the back door open, they come in there and  they stick a gun down Eddie Nash's throat and make him beg, and they took over a million  dollars worth of drugs, cash, and jewelry.  Well, I'm in Tahoe, we're performing at the Sahara Tahoe. 
[01:33:30]  I take a Learjet back to pick up a pound of cocaine and some cash, because I was collecting  from the clubs.  Well, in walks, he just had the robbery, maybe a couple hours before I got there.  Well, when I come there, Gregory Diles, his black bodyguard, brings in Holmes, and they  find out that Holmes set up the robbery, and they beat the shit out of Holmes, and they  ordered, and I was there when Nash gave the orders to have these people killed, and they 
[01:34:00]  used Liberace's Bill Blass Lincoln to drive Holmes up there, and he participated in some  of the killings up there, John did.  Oh, wow.  Now, what was the killing?  There was the robbery, and then what happened, and can you walk us through that, because Eddie  Nash's house was robbed.  Yeah, it was Holmes set up.  And then, so what they did was they found out who was responsible.  Oh, the actual burglar.  And then they were called the Wonderling Gang.  Okay, up in Laurel Canyon, there's a street called the Wonderland Avenue, so that's why 
[01:34:30]  it's called the Wonderling Killings, Laurel Canyon.  And so they ordered, Nash ordered these people executed, and they actually killed the wrong  people.  One guy was there, but they killed all the girlfriends.  You know, so they killed four girls and one guy, or was it three girls and one guy, and  then there was a count of attempted murder, so there was four counts of first-degree murder 
[01:35:00]  and one count of attempted murder.  Well, you know, the famous homicide detective that handled this case, that handled O.J., that  fucked up O.J.'s case, Tom Lang.  Oh, wow, that was him?  Yeah.  And so anyway, to make a long story, I testified, Nash puts a contract on me, because he starts  smoking that crack and gets all paranoid, and the next thing you know, I have a contract  placed on me.  I go to Florida, and I get gunned down and shot, so I testified. 
[01:35:30]  Nash gets a hold of one of the members of the jury.  Eleven of them came back with guilty plea, found them guilty.  One was not guilty.  Then back in 99, the feds then decided, well, we're going to go after him for money laundering,  racketeering.  So they brought the murders back, because normally you can't double jeopardy, you can't do that.  But anyway, he testified, or he, they did a deal with him. 
[01:36:00]  He pled guilty to conspiracy to commit murder on the Laurel Canyon, and also for jury tampering,  the one lady that I told Dale Davidson and all the other district attorney and the U.S.  attorneys, that he got to me, and so there was a jury fraud, and then a $250,000 fine.  He only spent 33 months in prison.  That's it, huh?  Can I ask where you were when you got shot? 
[01:36:30]  You said you were in Florida.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened there?  What was that moment like?  Well, what happened was, I went on the Federal Witness Protection Program, and I was so fucking  bored.  I mean, these guys, they take you, they take you to the loony bin.  I mean, way out in the sticks.  I mean, come on with my life.  So what I started doing was running cocaine, and the perfect thing I could do was running  it with the federal marshals in their car, and going through the airport.  They never checked me.  And then I became a preacher.  I did the Billy Graham. 
[01:37:00]  I did the Pat Robertson.  I became, yeah, I said, oh, the, you know, the horrible sins of Hollywood, and, and, uh,  and they, and they ate it up, and they loved it.  Were you being sincere?  Huh?  Were you being sincere?  I, for a while, then after I found out how the politics in those fucking churches, I  mean, I mean, they were horrible, especially some of this now.  He, he goes to the Witness Protection Program, right?  So nobody can find you and kill you.  Well, he gets five bullets in them, right?  And then he decides, well, you know, I kind of like the celebrity thing of Liberace, so 
[01:37:30]  I'll just be a minister.  Yeah, but I want to know about the day you got shot.  Yeah, what were you doing in that moment?  What were you doing where you were surprised, like, oh, fuck, they found me?  You know, I was in a hotel in Jacksonville, Florida, and they come in, they shoot me in  the head, the hand here, because I put my hand up, and it went through here and came  out there.  Yeah, there you go, wow.  And then right above the left nipple, they shot me, penetrated the heart, and then I took  three bullets through the abdomen.  Wow.  With a .38, up close, right from where Dennis, but, you know, I kept getting up. 
[01:38:00]  You know, I was pretty big back then, and I managed to break one of them, you know, kept  fighting, and then finally I said, I better lay down.  You know, I was running out of blood then.  Oh, fuck.  So you got shot in the head, the heart, and three times in the stomach.  Yeah.  And what kind of abdomen damage did it do?  Because the stomach seems like, you know, the motherfucker.  Well, the big thing was, is I was paralyzed, and went into my spine, and then I became paralyzed,  and then they, the doctors only gave me about 2% chance to live that day. 
[01:38:30]  And then I became, I died, and they brought me back.  After, like, almost 15 minutes, I was pronounced dead.  Wow.  What did you see, anything?  Did you see the light?  No.  I saw the devil.  I saw Liberace a big cock.  The big lumpy.  No, but I had to learn how to talk and walk and eat again, because I went into a coma.  And then they couldn't, when they were cutting me open, they only paralyzed me, so I went 
[01:39:00]  and moved, because my blood pressure was so low.  So I felt all that cutting through the bones, and pulling, and ripping.  So, I mean, this is what, you know, makes movies and books.  So did Liberace blow John Holmes?  Come on.  I don't know, but I mean, God.  How the fuck could you fit 12 inches down your throat?  Could you do that, Chrissy?  Can you fit 12 inches? 
[01:39:30]  I don't know.  I've never had 12 inches inside my mouth.  That's really big.  I know.  Don't make me sound inadequate, okay?  You are far from inadequate.  12 inches is just too big, though, and that's scary looking.  Is that how big it is?  That's how much of a good thing is.  Wonderful.  Anything over 9 is too big, I think.  9's good.  9's a good length, Dennis.  Isn't it, Dennis?  Dennis, 9's a great length, isn't it? 
[01:40:00]  Thumbs up from Dennis.  Anything over 9 is just too big.  Hey, Scott, we noticed that you're wearing a lot of jewelry.  Yeah.  Whose is that?  That's some of the gifts that Liberace gave me.  That's why I was wondering.  It looks like it was.  These are some of the ones that I didn't pawn.  Yeah, yeah.  And they threw me out.  So you were worth a lot of money at one point after Liberace, right?  Oh, yeah.  But you see, the NASH got it all.  Well, no, the federal government got it all because when NASH, the killings, they cracked  down.  They closed every fucking club. 
[01:40:30]  They took the property for income tax, IRS.  Yeah, there was no way you were getting your money from them.  And you went through a lot of your money.  Oh, well, yeah.  Did you behave fiscally irresponsibly?  I was irresponsibly.  Well, come on.  You've got to realize, you know, all those years with Lee, and Lee, I mean, he'd spend a  million dollars a week on me.  I mean, buying me homes and furniture and we were in Buffalo, New York and Lee comes 
[01:41:00]  out or no, the manager that owns the theater there, he had a beautiful 1962 Silver Cloud  Rolls Royce, all gold and with black tinted.  I love that.  Well, my 21st birthday was the following week.  Well, Liberace brought, Baron Hilton had designed, you know, he took the garage out and made  a big casino out of there.  But anyway, before he took the doors off, you know, he had that car in there with a 
[01:41:30]  big box and ribbon on there and then a little box that had the gold Rolls Royce key in there.  I mean, he was a very generous man.  Oh, man.  He was loaded, man.  How much money did Liberace have?  $250 million, $250 million estate, counting cash in real estate.  Wow.  Was it true that Hilton put a casino in your house and tried to get some of his money back?  Yeah.  Huh?  Well, they brought the casino.  Well, the main reason why Baron supplied it with the slot machines and the roulette tables 
[01:42:00]  was because of Frances Liberace.  She had a horrible habit of hitting people with a cane and they were afraid of lawsuits.  So, what they did was, Baron loaded the casino, all the slots and the roulette tables and all  that.  So, we had a private casino.  It was a beautiful home.  Actually, he built that house for me. 
[01:42:30]  It was five-track.  He bought the whole block.  And it was a 17,000 square foot palace.  That's crazy.  Nothing but glass and mirror.  It was absolutely gorgeous.  You know, where they filmed all this was at Zsa Zsa Kavar's house.  Oh, wow.  Oh, it was Zsa Zsa's house?  Yeah, because that was pretty impressive, too.  Did he get to see her?  She's, what, down to her head?  Yeah.  No, they cut her leg off.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  They're taking a body part every other year.  I think her husband's just waiting for that day to go. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  He's going to load up on everything.  He's amazed that she's lasted this long.  I don't doubt it.  Well, she's 93, 94 years old.  Yeah.  But, you know, I don't, I mean, you know, I mean, she, and Zsa Zsa was the bitch.  You know who was the nicest one was Ava.  Ava.  Ava was so nice.  She'd come in with Mer Griffin.  What another queen.  That guy was.  Mer was.  Oh, my God.  Well, you know, she loved Ava Kabor.  And that was his front.  You know, she made all the public appearances. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he was, you know, at home sucking cock.  But, I mean, Mer.  Did you guys ever party with him?  Yeah.  Well, Mer was one.  Oh, yeah.  He'd bring his little boy in and do their thing.  Did you guys do sloppies and all that?  No.  Did Mer ever suck your penis?  Ava Kabor.  Did Mer ever suck your penis?  No, but he could have.  I mean, he was low.  He was more loaded than Liberace.  Was he?  What happened to Liberace's house?  Is it still there?  Yeah.  They have it up for sale.  They're trying to sell it for $375,000 now. 
[01:44:00]  He put over $2 million in the house.  That's it?  $375,000.  Yeah, but he built it in the $50,000 neighborhood.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  And now it's a drug-ridden area.  Oh, wow.  The museum.  Now, here's a great idea that I have.  Wait, wait.  Liberace's house is in a bad.  I never knew that.  It was always in a bad neighborhood?  Well, this was.  4982 Shirley Street.  It's right off of Tropicana, across the street from the university there.  All bad area now.  Wow.  And then the museum is on Tropicana, right below Maryland Parkway. 
[01:44:30]  I'm the one that put that museum together in 78.  I took everything out of the houses and put it together.  We bought the shopping center.  Of course, when I got in, when we broke up, he took all the pictures of me out of the museum.  Can I ask you an odd question?  But now, excuse me, but now the museum is bankrupt.  See, the economy goes around.  Now it's bankrupt.  Now, they were hoping that this movie would be successful. 
[01:45:00]  So what I would like to do is, Dennis and I are talking about this, is, boy, what a great idea that would be.  He was putting, Dennis has got 22 acres out there, horse stables.  He's got a gym, you know, $2 million gym out there.  He's got this beautiful bunny ranch.  Put the Liberace, now that he's got a history with me, put the museum out there.  I could tell the stories.  Then we can get a reality show.  Scott Thorson at the bunny ranch with a, I'll put on a pink outfit. 
[01:45:30]  I want to be in your pool boy outfit.  I'm going to make you a bunny boy.  I want to make him a pool boy.  Or either, he can start pimping me out.  I mean, come to the bunny ranch and spend the night with Chrissy and a couple of the other girls.  And maybe he can get $100,000.  And I'll give him 50% of it.  I mean, come on.  Scott Thorson is available.  If it's good enough for Liberace, it's good enough for you.  All you people out there, if you want me, I'm available at the bunny ranch. 
[01:46:00]  He's hot and ready.  Yeah, where are you living right now?  Are you living out there with Dennis?  I'm living with Dennis, yeah.  Yeah, we're keeping kind of a short leash on him because I got him out without any restrictions, which is unheard of.  Right.  And no travel restrictions, no drug testing, anything.  So we're doing it all ourselves.  Right.  How long has he been out?  He's been out two weeks.  And what a difference.  I mean, everybody, now I go out to, you know, when I get to the hotel, there's paparazzi people with pictures, autographs. 
[01:46:30]  Everybody knows me.  We've been, you know, we did the Today Show.  We did the Barbara Walters Show.  We did E! Entertainment.  Everything.  Showbiz Tonight.  Joy Behar.  Showbiz Tonight, Special or Inside Edition.  Uh-huh.  And, I mean, it's just been going, going, going, going.  Set your TiVo for The View.  Oh, yeah.  See, Barbara Walters dealing with Scott Thorson.  Yeah.  And the homosexual issue.  Yeah.  It was a trip.  Oh, man. 
[01:47:00]  An 8,000-year-old chick trying to deal with homosexuality.  No kidding.  She called Dennis his benevolence.  Yeah.  Did she believe you?  Was Barbara Walters convocational?  No, no, no, no.  She felt that I was the victim.  Oh, okay.  She did.  So did Whoopi Goldberg.  They were both, they both pulled me aside and they said, look, we really hope you stay  clean this time and congratulations and especially Whoopi. 
[01:47:30]  She was wonderful.  She's really nice.  What would you say the nicest thing Liberace did for you was?  Because you said he was generous.  Now, there hadn't you, there was good times.  Well, you know, well, I mean, giving me this life.  I mean, I've made a, I made a pretty, I've made a good living and now, you know, I own  a percentage of that film and pretty soon, once we count all these box, that's if, you  know, they don't pad the bills.  Well, they will.  Huh?  Yeah.  You know they will.  Well, they can't, they really can't do, the movie was 20, the movie was 20, the cost 
[01:48:00]  of the movie was 23 million.  Okay.  Now, it's in every foreign country.  Originally, it was only going to be in England and France.  Now, it's in every foreign country, including Hong Kong and Japan.  And they expect, I mean, Italy, they love it because, you know, Liberace was, his father  was Salvador Liberace and he was from Sicily.  So, I mean, Italy is going, I just did a big spread with Vanity Fair Italy and they must 
[01:48:30]  have spent $20,000 on this photo spread.  I mean, they did it at Jack Studios.  It was wonderful.  And they catered, they sat in limousines and they really spent a lot of money on this.  What do you think, sorry, what do you think, I was watching the movie, what do you think  Liberace would think if he saw, if he knew that all this information was now out there?  Well, I think he's probably smiling, not right now.  I mean, because, you know. 
[01:49:00]  I kind of hope there's an afterlife so I can video, let's see TMZ video the two of them  and hook it up again.  Yeah, or just getting together and explaining yourself, like, well, you know, it's broken.  Well, I'm supposed to, when I die, I'm supposed to be buried in the tomb with him.  You know, he's out at Forest Lawn there in Burbank.  Big, beautiful, I guess they call it Mausoleum.  Yeah, Mausoleum.  Wow.  You still got that deal where that's where you'll be buried, do you think, or?  I don't think so.  I know.  Not so fast, Scott.  How long were you in jail? 
[01:49:30]  I was in jail 99 days.  Okay.  And, you know, here's the thing that really pissed me off the most about this, is, you  know, my business manager, Oliver, contacted Weintraub and he says, yeah, he says, find me  all the bail information, do this and do that.  And then he called my manager up and said, well, we're really not going to do this because  we don't want to get involved with Scott and let everybody know that he's a part of this 
[01:50:00]  film.  I said, what a dumb fuck.  It's my, I says, how can he say that when I wrote the book, I wrote the percentage of  the film, it's my life story, it isn't his fucking life story.  Yeah, he bought the motion picture rights, but I mean, it pissed me off a little bit.  Well, and Hollywood turned their back on me, Damon and Doug, all of them did.  And if it wasn't for me, they wouldn't have this fantastic movie and probably going to  be winning Oscars and all this.  And then on top of it, you know, being paid all these millions because Damon and Douglas, 
[01:50:30]  they're not cheap.  But all my gratitude goes to Dennis, you know, and you know, everybody says, well, why did  you do this?  You know, Dennis is a businessman.  You know, he's, I says, I'll scratch your back.  You scratch mine.  We do the PR.  He got me out.  Hey, wait, did you, did you, you never met Matt Damon?  Hey, listen, this, come on.  Look at, I got him trained already.  He's dressing like pink. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you meet Matt or no?  I haven't met any of us.  Why wouldn't Matt Damon want to talk to you?  They didn't even let me on the set.  They wouldn't let me.  I would think he would want to talk to you or spend some time with you.  So he's got it right.  Weintraub told me when I called, he says, no.  He says, I says, can you hire me as an advisor?  Because you would think if you're playing someone's life.  Yeah.  You would want to meet that. 
[01:51:30]  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Weintraub says, I don't want you near the set.  And he says, you cannot meet Michael Douglas or Matt Damon.  So what I did was I called Alan Butterfield and I blasted him.  Well, about a month later, who calls Jerry Weintraub?  He says, no more bad publicity.  He says, I'm going to fly you into Hollywood and you're going to go at HBO and see a private screening of this.  Was Michael Douglas and Matt Damon a little too comfortable in those roles for you?  I have to question these guys. 
[01:52:00]  I think they did good because they made it look very believable.  They certainly did.  They're either really good actors or, you know, I might have a touch.  It only took them one shot to do that scene.  Well, you know, what a Daring Roe, when you stop and think about it, the nude scenes, and then pounding Michael Douglas.  I bet she Catherine says, I wonder what she's thinking, you know?  I bet she's saying, I wish Michael Douglas would pound me that hard.  Next time I see Catherine Cedar Jones, I'm going to ask her if I can pound Michael that hard. 
[01:52:30]  I bet she should let me because since he came out and saying that, you know, she gave him, I guess, because he got cancer from oral sex.  Right, right.  Oral sex.  Boy, I've divorced that son of a bitch.  He backed off that whole thing immediately because I'm sure she gave him a talking to him.  I've got to ask you about Liberace.  There's rumors that he tried to have you killed after he left.  Well, let me just say this.  I was beat up pretty bad in the penthouse. 
[01:53:00]  This was done by Seymour Heller.  I was also threatened that if I went to the press, that I would disappear in Las Vegas.  But, you know, I had balls back then.  I mean, I took him.  Here's a big, powerful man.  Around Michael's chin.  And, you know, Baron Hilton of the Hilton Hotels and all that.  Right.  You know, they threatened.  They told me to stay out of Vegas. 
[01:53:30]  And that's one of the reasons why he even took my house back that he got me out there.  He says, well, I'll give you $75,000 for it.  Wow.  But you're not coming out here.  I went out there anyway.  I terrorized.  I used to throw eggs at his house.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  But you got beat up in the penthouse.  Yeah.  Whose penthouse?  Well, on Beverly Boulevard, you know, right down.  It's right before Fairfax.  It used to be Red Skeleton's building.  It's a big office building.  And then on the fifth floor is the penthouse. 
[01:54:00]  And that's where we lived after we sold.  He gave me the Herald Way mansion that used to belong to Rudy Valley.  15-room mansion up there.  He just gave to you.  Yeah.  And I had my grandfather sell it for a million dollars back in 81.  What a fucking fool I was.  Because it's probably worth $5 million.  But it was gorgeous.  It's on the top.  It's right above Sunset.  Right.  And the view on it.  And the bar just wrapped around.  And you can see downtown L.A.  You can see Catalina. 
[01:54:30]  Gorgeous house.  Dennis would love that.  It's take two, Dennis.  When he got out of jail, we spoke by Skype.  Right.  That's the only thing we did.  We got out of jail.  We got out with a bunch of the girls there, Chrissy's friends.  And he gave me a big hug.  And he says, thank you so much.  You don't need to thank me.  I'm going to have plastic surgery done.  You're going to look like me now.  But I want to know about the beating in the penthouse.  Who beat you up?  And that was that.  Well, what they did was, I wouldn't leave.  What they did was, they, Heller. 
[01:55:00]  That was the lawyer, right?  No, the manager.  Oh, yeah.  Liberace's longtime manager.  It was, funny thing, it was Seymour Heller, Lux, and Gabby.  And they had Lawrence Welk, and then Seymour, they split up.  And so the other guys took Lawrence Welk, and Seymour Heller kept Liberace.  So he was his hatchet man.  He hired the private detectives. 
[01:55:30]  And they, this is really funny, too.  We're in the deposition, right?  And his attorney says, oh, my, what is this?  Oh, it's a scale, and it's got traces of cocaine, and we have your fingerprints.  I says, have you ever thought of whoever put me on that fucking drug?  I says, you moron.  Well, he stuck his foot in his arm.  I mean, we won.  Oh, man.  How long after you got together did you go in for the surgery, for the plastic surgery? 
[01:56:00]  Well, I was pretty young.  I was about 17, 18.  So you were together maybe a year or so?  Now, obviously, that's a pretty big step.  What were you thinking?  Well, you've got to realize, you know, I came from a broken home.  I was in a lot of foster homes, a poor family, and then all of a sudden thrown into this wealth,  and this man is showing you all the attention, the glamour, the wealth, you know, I mean, the homes. 
[01:56:30]  I did everything possible to please this guy.  Wow.  Because I didn't want to be thrown out.  So, I mean, if it was, you know, letting them suck my cock or, you know, getting plastic surgery, I did it.  It seems to be pretty extreme.  That's even more than like a, you know, tat.  Right.  That's pretty extreme.  I was just, you know, it seems like something, especially after only a year of being with him.  Yeah.  Yeah, being with him.  Were you insulted?  No, no, no.  What did he ask you?  No. 
[01:57:00]  Mm-mm.  If he said you weren't plastic.  He took, you know, like what Rob Lowe did.  Uh-huh.  I mean, what he did, he took that portrait off the wall, and he said, now I want you to create him like me.  Yeah, but you didn't feel like, what, am I too ugly for you?  No, no.  I was flattered, actually, because you wanted him.  I was up to the good, bad, and ugly.  They're saying they have to go, but before they do, we got to plug properly.  Oh, my God.  What an amazing 45 minutes. 
[01:57:30]  Holy fuck.  And also, thanks, Dennis, man.  Really, Scott.  You fucking really came through.  I'm just like you.  I want to go to the Bunny Ranch.  This is a bestseller.  You need to come to the Bunny Ranch.  As sick as you are.  I've never been out there.  As sick as you are.  You know why?  Because Dennis is my friend, and he's offered me so many times, and it's like, I just don't like  to, it's like, I'm weird with friends.  I heard him say that on Penn's show, and I emailed Penn and said, fuck him.  He needs to get out.  You've got no reason to come, not come now.  I know.  I'm single too.  What about you guys?  At least come out and have a drink.  Do you guys need a permission slip, Randy?  Come out and have a drink, exactly. 
[01:58:00]  Yes, I'm good.  I'm good.  You think you'd get in trouble if you went out there for a live event?  Oh, for a live event or something.  If you'd like that final decision, just go to BunnyRanch.com, and it's the finest online shopping  in the world.  BunnyRanch.com.  All the girls up there and everything.  No, I'm good.  I'd go out there and broadcast and all that shit, though.  What the fuck is that?  500 girls.  What if we do some type of a contest and bring some listeners out?  I would love that so much.  Remember the one guy?  Yes. 
[01:58:30]  Oh.  Remember the guy back in the day?  Yeah.  He was in a miserable marriage, and oh my God, we got into some shit with Dennis.  Yeah.  And he ended up staying out there for a while.  How much fun was that?  It was awesome.  And his wife, we got the wife on the phone, and she's like, I don't give a fuck what he  does.  You know what we want to do?  I'm going to get Scott back on with you guys before the sentence or after the sentencing.  Sure.  Because it's going to get pretty heated up.  I hope the judges aren't listening to this.  Scott.  Well, they are.  I want them to.  You know, look, if I got the drug test that you're clean, then guess what? 
[01:59:00]  You're going to skate on this thing.  If you fuck up.  Yeah.  Where are you at with the drugs these days?  I mean, you're in jail, so it made it tougher, obviously.  Well, yeah.  Six months clean on the drugs.  Good.  What was your poison recently?  Pardon me?  What was your main poison recently?  It was, well, let me tell you, in August 2012, I was diagnosed with anal cancer.  Ow.  That killed Farrah Fawcett, so I nearly lost my life. 
[01:59:30]  They put me on heavy doses of chemo and radiations, and I had second and third degree burns all  over my ass and balls.  It was one of the most painful things.  Oh, fuck.  You've lived a life, sir.  And so what happened was, because of the chemo, it made me so sick that I almost died because  your white count goes down, and you get every kind of disease in there because your white  blood cells are destroyed, and that's what fights your infections off. 
[02:00:00]  So I had these sores in my mouth, sores all over my head, and so it triggered.  They were giving me Oxycontin, 80 milligrams, and they were giving me synthetic heroin, which  was the morphine.  So it triggered my drug addiction.  And then all the money that, the upfront money that I got on the movie all went for my radiation  because I only had partial insurance.  So I had a $97,000 bill for radiation. 
[02:00:30]  So, I mean, you know, I was very depressed.  I did some stupid things.  You know, when, like I said earlier, you know, when you're under the influence, you know...  What a buzzkill this story is.  Tell me, tell us one good story to go out on.  Fuck you.  Wait, we're crying now.  Well, there's a couple.  It leads to more questions.  Yeah.  How's the ass cancer?  You're beating it?  Well, you know, in jail, they weren't treating me, so Dennis is in the process of right now.  No, Dennis doesn't check my ass, you know. 
[02:01:00]  He's got a doctor that...  Dennis, you've got to check for the sores.  You know that.  You're responsible now, sir.  Yeah, be a friend.  Be a friend.  What are you doing?  Give me a latex glove.  You want to see my ass, Dennis?  We'll give you a latex glove, Dennis.  Tell me about Larry Gatlin, because I don't get that one.  Oh, yeah, I get Larry.  And still, after all this, he's got a great head of hair on him.  Look at him.  You really do.  Yeah.  But are you okay, healthy-wise?  Health-wise, are you getting...  Well, we don't know yet.  I'm in the process.  When we get back, I've got to have...  It's time now that I have a PET scan, and they check it every three to six months.  And then once I get a PET scan, and then it'll... 
[02:01:30]  Well, right now, they've found a...  It's either a cyst or possible mask.  It's very small.  So I just hope to God that it hasn't gone to my liver, because then I might as well...  Look at you too late.  Oh, my God.  I haven't been late in six months.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  That's going to change soon, though.  This has been crazy.  Let's put it in the book, because this is a fascinating dude, man.  Behind the Candle Labrador.  It's the same title as the film, but it's My Life with Liberace. 
[02:02:00]  And you're a really, really very forthcoming person.  It's nice when you interview somebody, and there's not one time that you said,  well, I don't want to, or gee, we shouldn't.  It's nice to have somebody who just talks about everything.  Well, you know how I got that idea was that, you know, I was sitting there...  Doing Liberace with a candelabra.  Well, he always had a candelabra on that piano, and I says, hey, that's going to be my title,  Behind the Candelabra.  These people...  He was a very private man.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  Nobody dared to go against him.  Right.  I want to get Chrissy on sometime.  She's starting to do a thing.  She's getting lots of letters from penitentiaries.  Oh, yeah.  I want her to come on and read some of the letters.  We'll do a call-in or something.  That'd be cool.  They're just funny letters.  We thought we want to...  I guess they like you, huh?  They love her.  What's not to love?  Yeah.  Oh, hey, and I went to prison, too.  I forgot to tell you guys.  Wow.  The prison story.  I went to work for the Mexican Mafia cartel and got caught with five pounds of meth, 
[02:03:00]  and I ended up in Corcoran State Prison.  But that was right at the time when I signed the deal with Weintraub,  so I went to prison with $50,000 on my trust account, inmate trust account,  and I had a ball in prison.  The best-looking guys.  And talk about crooked is the Department of Corrections,  because I bought all the drugs that I wanted. 
[02:03:30]  So you had no problem getting drugs.  No, and they kept me...  I kept Charlie Manson company.  I can tell you stories about Charlie.  I heard he's crazy.  What do you mean he's got to go?  He's got a Charlie Manson story.  You know, we're going to have him call in,  because there's a ton of stories with Fox.  Are you doing Fox News?  Fox News is in a studio.  Okay, man.  They have to roll over there.  Yeah, hey, thanks so much for coming in.  When I come back for book two, we'll share Manson.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to get some pictures.  We're going to take a quick break. 
[02:04:00]  Dennis Hoff, you're the fucking man.  You already know that.  Good to see you.  He made this happen.  Scott Thorpe said it.  The book behind the candelabra.  My Life with Liberace.  Holy fuck, what an hour.  We'll be back with Nick DiPaolo.  Stay there.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XMZ.  That was amazing. 
[02:04:30]  Fucking amazing.  Scott Thorson, as Jimmy said right after the mics went off, that fucking guy delivered. 
[02:05:00]  Yes, he did.  Scott Thorson delivered Liberace's ex in studio.  Holy fuck.  Did you see the movie Nick DiPaolo?  Oh, did I ever?  Did I ever?  It's funny.  I'm watching it at some parts.  I'm like, this is a good movie.  And then other parts, it felt like an SNL sketch.  Michael Douglas and Matt Damon making fun of Liberace.  Right.  I mean, Michael Douglas is my favorite actor of all time.  Is he really?  Oh, from Streets of San Francisco, fucking Gordon Gekko. 
[02:05:30]  But it was kind of creepy.  That hour was amazing.  Yeah.  He should be the new Dos Equis guy that's got the most interesting man in the world.  Right.  You think there were some exaggerations there?  That's what we were trying to figure out afterwards.  Hard to say because some of it might have been with the time frames or whatever, but...  Pumped it up a little bit.  There's so much that you know is true.  Yeah, you can document it.  Yeah.  Like, I mean, once Liberace has been sucking your cock and buying you Rolls Royces...  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  How do you not?  I'm sure there's some receipts.  Cum Stain receipts lying around.  Right.  It's almost like he doesn't really need to exaggerate.  And it's all Rock Hudson, Merv Griffin.  Yeah, it's all believable stuff.  I'm trying to tweet a picture as you talk.  What I was going to say, you think he's addicted to adrenaline?  Is he an adrenaline junkie?  Because he seems like he gets involved with some crazy stuff over and over again.  I'd say 80-20.  80-20?  Truth to maybe exaggeration.  Look, because if you'll suck Liberace's cock for money and fame, I'm sure you wouldn't think 
[02:06:30]  twice about making up a few stories to keep it going.  And then he has throwaway...  There's kind of a soullessness there.  But then he has throwaway stories like, yeah, me and Michael Jackson.  And, you know, Michael Jackson pounded him.  They kept that quiet.  Yeah, because there was an article that came out.  That's why I asked him if the Jackson family ever came after him, because they seem to really  come after people that make those accusations.  They never came after Scott Thorson after that article came out.  Can we look up pictures of Michael Jackson and Scott Thorson?  I want to see if there's any photos of them. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  And the Merv Griffin...  And I want to know more about, you know, there's strong rumors that Liberace was trying  to get Scott Thorson killed after that whole thing fucking fell apart.  But then he had four other stories that we had to get into.  I know, near the end, he goes, by the way, I did five years in a Mexican prison.  Did I mention it?  But then he goes, yeah, and I hung out with Charlie Manson.  And then Dennis Hoff, who we love and we can't fucking, you know, kill here, he says,  he's got to go.  I'm like, what do you mean he's got to go?  He's got Charlie Manson stories now.  It's not every day you have someone in studio that has Charlie Manson stories. 
[02:07:30]  Jesus.  Where was he going?  Uh, Fox.  What, Fox and Friends?  I guess.  They'll have the same interview, right?  There they are right there.  There's, um...  There's pictures.  And he's behind Michael.  Right.  They might not have pants on in that picture.  When Scott Thorson came in, me and Ant kind of, like, saw the same thing.  He put his stuff down and he looked right at us and it was creepy because you felt like  you were looking at Liberace. 
[02:08:00]  That is the creepiest part of the whole story, to have the fucking plastic surgery to look  like Liberace.  And I was telling, me and you kind of looked at the same time and then looked at each  other like, how creepy is this?  So freaky.  It was...  If you put a Liberace wig on him...  Is that right?  Holy...  Dude, it was fucked up.  I stayed in the...  I was afraid to shake it.  I was going to have to touch his hand.  I swear to God.  I stayed in the green.  Hey.  And he had the voice and everything and he looked...  Like, his mouth was...  It looked exactly like fucking Liberace. 
[02:08:30]  He's just like, hey, hey, hey.  And then he had the chin and the eyes and then when he smiled, he smiled like Liberace used  to know.  How funny is that he said he did his voice perfectly and he goes, I would call the stores  where he had accounts and go, hey, it's Lee.  Send Scott.  And he would have, like, furniture and shit.  Send Scott some gifts.  Holy fuck, man.  What was the name of the girl?  Christy?  Christy.  Christy.  Huh?  Christy, probably?  The girl with the tits. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  Because I'm so...  Was she from the ranch, you mean?  Of course.  You could go down there, pay money and fuck her, apparently.  Well...  I guess that's the gimmick he's got going down there.  You pay some money, you get to fuck these girls.  That flies in America.  She watched the bunny ranch on HBO.  When she was 15.  15.  And that's why she's now with Dennis Loss.  And she's like, oh, I gotta do that.  She couldn't have been watching the fucking, like, Smithsonian channel.  Exactly.  Fucking Riverdance.  She saw that and said, I gotta be a part of that. 
[02:09:30]  It's good that the media doesn't influence behavior in kids, right?  No.  There you go.  Give me a fucking break.  Sent her right to the bunny ranch.  And he's all proud of the fact that she was with one guy before she came to the bunny ranch.  Yeah, Dennis.  She was only with one guy before the bunny ranch.  Like, well, I guess you made up for that.  Hey, you're on the clock, sweetheart.  Gotta make up the lost time.  And then just, like, taking pictures.  Taking pictures with the fucking guy here. 
[02:10:00]  And Dennis is just going, hey, get behind him.  Show your tits.  He's the best.  How does a guy...  He's just the best.  You know, I'm not gonna judge anybody in this life.  But, wow.  I'd like to know his childhood.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck is...  Where you could just be a guy that's like, yeah, take your clothes off.  Yeah, suck his dick.  Go ahead.  Yeah, and nobody thinks badly.  I think about it like that.  I treat women like that.  You're an asshole.  Yeah, yeah, you're an asshole. 
[02:10:30]  This guy's a genius.  Because he's making money on it.  It was...  It's fucked up, man.  What a country.  A lot of country.  You know, it's nice to see, though, that he's doing something good and nice and taking  care of Scott like this.  No self-serving fucking...  Holy fuck.  Self-promoting fucking...  Holy fuck.  He's a marketing whiz, man.  He really is smart, man.  Well, you...  It's his elephant...  It's like you cling on to the hottest story in the world.  That's what it is.  It's his elephant man.  He's bringing him down the fucking bunny ranch. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Hi.  I will suck your car.  But Scott's grateful, though.  Scott doesn't feel it.  Scott's like, this guy got me out of jail.  I fucking paid for my lawyer.  Like, he's actually doing something for him.  The rear end justifies the means.  Yeah, he seems to have a pattern where guys take care of him.  Come on, Scott.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bail him out of tough situations.  Right.  He definitely needs a sugar daddy.  A male figure in his life.  Right, right.  We could have easily done another hour.  Oh, my God.  I wonder what other names he's got.  Oh, yeah.  I want to hear more about Liberace's fucking silicone-injected lumpy uncut cock. 
[02:11:30]  Who doesn't want to hear that, though?  I don't know.  I threw away my egg sandwich in the fucking drink.  I was like, oh, what the fuck?  I'm eating lumpy fucking oatmeal right now.  Jesus.  I know.  I love that Liberace has a big fucking dick and it's all lumpy.  That makes me happy.  Oh, lumpy.  Why is it lumpy?  What's that?  Because he has silicone injected into his dick.  Didn't affect me like that.  That's some...  Jesus.  How about Liberace in that scene the first time Scott sees him with his wig off? 
[02:12:00]  Oh, that's great.  I was fucking laughing.  I paused it.  It was like Larry from the Stooges.  Jesus Christ was I laughing.  Hey, I'm going to play the piano.  Oh, boy.  Look at this tune.  Hey, Scott.  Come here and suck my cock.  Oh, boy.  He did look like Larry.  I'm fine.  He did.  I paused it.  I called my wife downstairs.  I go, look at this. 
[02:12:30]  Liberace fuck Larry Fine.  Hey, Mo.  Look at Mo.  Why?  Oh, shit.  He's doing some gardening.  Hey, where'd you get that hoe, Mo?  Oh, you got it?  See?  Because I see what he's done there.  What a fucking pisser.  He looked like Larry Fine.  I think that movie enters the realm of like Mommy Dearest.  It's kind of a goofy, you laugh at it more than you're like, oh my goodness, what's happening  here?  I mean, there's a scene. 
[02:13:00]  It cuts from something, just some inane little scene to Liberace, Michael Douglas, with his  head over the headboard of the bed, just getting pounded in the ass by Matt Damon.  And I'm just like, oh, holy fuck.  Well, that's what I said to Jimmy.  I'm watching it.  Some parts, I'm like, this is a good movie.  And then other parts, I felt like it was an SNL sketch.  Matt Damon.  Yes.  Making fun of Liberace.  Right.  And then me watching with my cock in my hand going, what happened?  Why am I pulling this thing so rigorously? 
[02:13:30]  Fuck.  Yeah, it is.  What a fucking story.  I like, Opie has something that was pretty interesting in that, it's like, what would  he think Liberace would think with all of his dirty laundry?  I said that.  Jimmy said that one.  That was you?  Someone else credit for my question.  I didn't hear it in English accent, so I thought that was Opie.  You minding the thing?  What would Lee be saying?  What would Lee say?  You know, did you work out a lot at the gym?  Were you eating better? 
[02:14:00]  Oh, fucking fantastic.  I think Liberace wouldn't mind it, because he'd be about 106, right?  Well, that's true.  And he'd be in a wheelchair with a bag on his hip, and just fucking...  A fur-lined, a mink fur, a colostomy.  Yeah.  Filled with half shit and cum.  Scott said he never fucked him, though.  He didn't kiss him.  That I didn't believe.  And he never kissed him?  Yeah, I didn't believe that.  Bullshit.  I did believe that Lee would probably just suck his dick, and that was the main thing,  but I don't believe that he never fucked him or whatever.  You won't admit to suck his dick, but you'll wear that chauffeur's outfit? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, that chauffeur's outfit was great.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, yes.  Oh, look at that.  Liberace and Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  Right there.  I remember Lee on the Merv Griffin Show.  Oh, you too, right?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Right?  And the...  Lee.  I just called him Lee.  I know.  Just say Lee.  What does that mean, Lee?  I don't know.  I guess...  Where are they getting that?  Lee Baraci.  Yeah.  I guess.  Short for Lee Baraci.  It was fucking Lib.  Yeah.  It was so fucked up, because they would talk to him like he was a hetero guy. 
[02:15:00]  Lee, did you...  You got a guy...  A guy?  You got a girl in your life?  What's happening?  Lee, any women?  Well, I'm still looking, Merv.  You know, it's...  Can we look at Liberace and Merv Griffin?  Is there any clips of that?  It has to be.  I hope so.  It's not the fact, but it's Merv Griffin asking that question.  Yeah, yeah.  Mr. Fucking...  Mr., you know.  Well, yeah, he was...  Another one everybody thought was married to, you know.  He started banging one of the Gabor sisters.  Yeah.  Scott alluded to that. 
[02:15:30]  He said, uh, oh, Merv, oh, that queen.  Yeah.  Yeah, he alluded to...  Yeah.  Alluded.  Two guys pretending they like pussy on the couch.  Yeah.  It's like us in the studio.  Jesus.  We just want to get out of here and tug each other's puns until the cows come home.  Oh, E-Rock, come home.  Oh, Liberace.  Nick, you're at, uh, what are you doing, Carolina?  It doesn't matter.  Let's talk about Liberace.  Come on.  I'm coming out tonight dressed like Liberace chauffeur.  You should do that. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, my God.  The chauffeur outfit.  I'm going to have two, like, bodybuilders carry me out on my shoulders.  Hold on.  Do you like this?  Isn't this wonderful?  It's always trying for that approval.  The word wonderful to me is a tip-off.  Yeah.  What do you think of this?  Fabulous.  I've never used one.  I know fabulous is the...  Wonderful's the one.  Wonderful's right there.  Let's say hi to Brother Joe.  Oh.  Anthony's brother.  I was all good with that movie.  I was looking forward to that movie, and I was all good with it.  Even, like, you know, the serious gay scenes and when, you know...  But he said, oh, look who else is up this morning. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  I was fine.  I was fine with all that.  I was fine with all of that until the funeral scene at the end when Liberace fucking flies  away.  That was the gayest...  How funny was that?  That was the gayest...  You were fine with all the ass play and the fucking making out.  But the second Liberace took off...  That really was a metaphor, though.  Him floating up to the ceiling.  Oh, it was really, like, yeah.  He was lighting his loafers, I guess. 
[02:17:00]  That's when I needed a shower.  That's when I felt like I needed a shower.  It is the best place to jerk off.  Pause it.  Pause it.  He's halfway to the ceiling.  Fucking dick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, boys.  All right, Joe.  Thank you, man.  Joe.  That is true, though.  It's like, at the end, it was very odd.  He was having this vision of Lee on stage and flying.  Floating up to the ceiling.  Floating.  That was fucking hilarious.  He had this big, dumb smile on his face, imagining it. 
[02:17:30]  And how did they make a movie without Matt Damon talking to Scott Thorson?  Yeah, I guess they really didn't want to involve him.  They're like, here, there's your story.  Take a hike.  Go take a fucking hike.  But usually those guys, they hang with the real person.  Yeah, you follow them around.  You follow them around for a while.  I think it's Damon a method actor.  But, I mean, he played him so well.  Like, the voice.  And, like, you...  Yeah.  I mean, although Matt just kind of played himself.  But, like, you know, he did a great job.  And Scott was happy.  Yeah, he's fucking great.  Both of them. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like I said, though, it kind of has that mommy dearest thing.  I think in years to come, it will only be a comedy.  I agree.  It would have been more believable with two less-known people, don't you think?  Yeah.  That's true, too.  You know what I mean?  Because you're just like...  You know, it's Michael Douglas.  It was good because you're saying, like, wow, Michael Douglas is doing a great job as Liberace.  But if it was just some unknown guy, you'd be like, all right, that guy's doing a good Liberace.  But, yeah, I'm not distracted by the fact that it's Michael Douglas.  I kept having to remind myself this is not good in the get-go. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Straight to San Francisco.  I mean, he's like my favorite fucking assholes.  Tear their fucking assholes out, Ollie.  Get him, Ollie.  I thought I was watching the Bourne Sodomy.  Time to wake up, Bud Fox.  Tell me something I don't know, pal.  It's probably get-go at night, right?  Yeah.  Fuck, after all the deals are made, huh?  It was... 
[02:19:00]  Nick DiPaolo, Caroline's, let's do this, people.  Eight o'clock tonight.  So, there's going to be torrential floods, I heard.  Yeah, it's supposed to be fucking nasty.  That might be here for me.  Why wouldn't it be, right?  What is it, El Doracho or something?  Yeah, I don't get it.  What do they call this one?  Yeah, El Doracho is the weather system.  The fuck is that?  A new snack?  I know.  You have an El Doracho.  Cool Ranch Doracho.  I love those.  It comes in a vagina-shaped bag.  I heard it. 
[02:19:30]  They're throwing it around today like everyone's heard this now.  You know, like El Nino and stuff, the weather system out west and shit like that.  Yeah.  And now they're throwing it around like, well, El Doracho's moving in with thunderstorms and stuff.  It's like, don't fucking bring that up like I've heard this.  I've been around for a few years.  I watch the Weather Channel every so often.  But I would have heard El Doracho before.  No, exactly right.  They pulled this one out of their fucking ass.  How bad is it, you think?  I mean, they've got to tell us if it's going to take our house or not.  Those flood warnings last night. 
[02:20:00]  I'm coming home from Caroline's.  They're warning about floods in the morning.  About floods today from El Doracho.  I go, yeah.  That was going to be great.  You know what, though?  It's like they say, Nick.  When it rains, it pours.  Oh, good one.  You brought that to me.  Rock with it.  How about your Bruins, brother?  Dude.  How about your Bruins?  You're a hockey fan.  Boston guys are all into it right now.  I know you're a hockey fan.  Hockey, absolutely.  I don't know how basketball is as popular as it is.  I mean, if you're a sports fan and you watched one minute of playoff hockey, you're like, 
[02:20:30]  if just a sports fan, not a hockey fan, you'd be like, this is unbelievable.  I love hockey.  Actually, I love playoff hockey, but I couldn't stay up.  Oh, I get home last.  It's three overtimes.  I know.  Triple overtimes.  I get home and I sit in the kitchen and chat with the wife for an hour before I get  out and sit.  Now it's about 11.  I literally say to her, I've got to get up to do Opie and Anthony.  I hope this isn't an overtime game.  Oh, correct.  Cut to me.  It's quarter of two.  The guy goes, it's the sixth longest game in the history of the NBA.  Ten minutes later, he goes, it's the fourth longest game of the NBA.  I'm fucking sitting there holding my eyes. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Went to bed at like, I don't know, 2.30.  The alarm went off at six.  Oh, shit.  So did you watch the game from the beginning?  I watched the whole, yeah, the whole fucking thing.  I recorded it.  You recorded it and no one fucked it up for you, telling you what the score was at that  point.  That's the beauty of New York.  Everybody's a basketball fan.  Nobody really gives a shit.  Who won the game?  The Blackhawks.  Blackhawks.  They got two fluky goals.  It was a soft goal in the end, but what a game.  Unbelievable.  How late in the third overtime did they score?  Probably, I don't know, six, seven minutes in? 
[02:21:30]  Is this the finals that they're playing?  Yeah, for the cup.  This is it.  And it's a big deal, the NHL, because it's two original six teams, you know?  That's a great season.  Chicago and the Bruins, and they haven't played each other forever.  And what's the game score?  That was it.  First game.  It's first game.  Oh, just one of them.  First game goes three overtime.  That's pretty sick.  And they said it was going to be a classic series.  It's already building up to be fucking legendary.  Were you bummed out they lost, or you were like, ah, it's one game, they'll be okay?  It didn't really bother me, because the Bruins, to me, had the edge in play the whole game, 
[02:22:00]  you know?  I still think they're going to win this year.  It was such good fucking hockey that, honest to God, I was a little disappointed, you know?  I'm not a fucking 12-year-old kid that's Bobby O's picture.  I'm like, I told you that about a month ago.  But, you know what I mean?  But I was a little bummed, but it was such a goddamn good hockey game.  Do you hate the fights in hockey?  It's not that many, Jimmy, anymore.  They're not going it up like they used to.  No, they don't.  They're taking it out, and they basically say, okay, each team gets one guy.  Yeah.  They play rough, though, man. 
[02:22:30]  They do.  Their hits are ridiculous.  The Phillies were flying all night.  They were fucking brutal.  I think you can really understand it.  If you really think about it, this guy's fucking flying into another guy on ice skates.  You've got to go to a game.  At about 25 miles an hour.  Yeah, yeah, they're moving.  And they're big now.  And pinning them against the boards, it's how they just keep skating, it amazes me.  No, people take it for granted, you know?  If you've ever played and been on skates, you know, it's amazing.  Imagine being able to just wail into any baseball player out on the field like you can in hockey, 
[02:23:00]  and then he's got to get up and put the ball into play.  Fucking guy would be crying.  When they show, like, old hockey, not even that old, like 80s, even early 90s,  there seems to be so much fucking room out there.  Yeah.  It is crowded now because they're so much faster and they're a bit bigger.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  But you see some of those old highlights, like, man, they had a lot of room to fucking try to figure some shit out.  Not anymore, man.  No, they're huge.  It's all split-second shit.  You've got to get the right bounce.  Every time they put the camera on anybody on the bench during the playoff, 
[02:23:30]  everybody has at least 11 stitches that were put in, like, four minutes ago.  No one looks relaxed.  No.  They're all, like, chomping at the bit, looking, when are they going to get out there?  Exactly.  Yeah, it really is an amazing score playoff.  Nobody shaves.  Then you get fucking basketball where a guy, like, gets near another guy  and he'll fling himself on the floor and, oh!  I can't imagine.  I believe that basketball playoffs are still going up.  Yeah, they're, what is it, two games to one at this point? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  It's not playoff.  It's like the, this is it.  No, this is it for basketball.  I can't watch it after hockey.  I can't watch it.  I can't watch it.  There's a whistle every three seconds.  Yeah.  It can be a two-point game with a minute left, and it takes 45 minutes.  45 minutes.  Each team gets 11 timeouts.  And you didn't need to watch the whole game at that point.  I don't like it as much as I used to.  I used to be a big basketball fan, but I just want to see LeBron lose.  I'm just, like, hoping.  You don't like LeBron?  I like him.  I've never heard him be really cocky. 
[02:24:30]  No?  No.  I mean, people just hate him because he's successful.  I like seeing him lose.  I'm all about the Spurs.  Taking the Spurs and your Bruins.  Got to go Bruins.  Take the Spurs because they're underdogs, aren't they?  Well, they kicked their ass last game.  They destroyed them.  But anyway, we got a news guy that kind of fucked up.  Did you hear this yet?  I don't even want to explain.  Just play it.  Man, no one gets a break anymore.  Please tell me it's Brian Williams.  Yeah.  What a comedian.  It goes with today's theme. 
[02:25:00]  I'll say that much.  Yeah.  All right.  I pledge allegiance to the flag.  That meant the start of the school day for most of us growing up.  Tonight, one city debates whether they should end the practice at their council meetings.  And here in the Twin Cities, many people celebrate the Twin Cities Pride Festival.  That's gay parade?  Yeah.  And he said, I pledge allegiance to the flag.  Yeah, that's not an accident.  We're talking about him, right?  Everybody's probably talking about him.  Uh-huh.  This is the new...  It's plausible deniability, too.  Yeah.  That's like, hey, I fucking made a mistake. 
[02:25:30]  Exactly.  All right.  That's this.  Is he the one that came out by accident?  What?  There's another clip, supposedly, where a news guy comes out by accident.  And he's not a weatherman?  How do you do...  Yeah, that was a weatherman.  What the hell is that little fraternity?  Wow.  That was what I was thinking of.  My boyfriend, El Doracho.  El Doracho.  Hey.  Nice.  500 don't get you no El Doracho.  You ever see Vice Squad with Season Hubbly and Wingshauser?  Jimmy loves that movie.  Vice Squad.  I don't think so.  It's so quotable. 
[02:26:00]  But there's a beat-up Nina Blackwood.  He kills her in one of the opening scenes.  He beats her with a pimp stick.  Nina Blackwood was in a movie?  Yeah.  She played...  It was done in like 82, and she plays a fucking hooker.  Ramrod, you ain't gonna hit me.  I promise, Ginger.  I'm just gonna make you feel so good.  And she opens the door, and then he...  Because she held out on her, he grabs her hair, and he goes,  I cannot believe how stupid you are.  And then he fucking beats her to death.  And so the rest of the movie, her hooker friend, Season Hubbly,  goes after Ramrod, like the Texas white pimp. 
[02:26:30]  Uh-huh.  And he gets...  And he reruns in it from what's happening.  He plays a sugar...  I can't believe I haven't seen it.  I know, right?  He plays a sugar pimp named Dorsey, and Ramrod, he goes,  You know what the problem with you sugar pimps is?  You ain't got no balls, boy.  And he sticks a fucking swish blade into the guy's...  And he stabs Rerun the dick.  Is that the one Rerun won the Academy Award for?  No, he's nominated for a Daytime Emmy.  But he wouldn't do the dance.  What's happening?  The lockers? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  There's that one scene where he goes...  He's handcuffed, and he, I think, escapes from the cop car.  You're quoting this like, it's good, fellas.  It's a good movie.  But he goes to this fucking...  This black guy, Roscoe.  Roscoe's gonna cut the fucking handcuffs off him in this garage.  Yeah.  And he goes...  That's great.  He goes, come on, Roscoe, move it, move your black ass.  And then Roscoe holds a fucking, like a saw blade, a sawzall against his neck and threatens him.  And then he goes, get the cuffs off it. 
[02:27:30]  He goes, how much are you doing?  He goes, I want an Eldorado.  And he goes, 500 don't get you, no Eldorado.  That's my favorite movie quote ever.  Ever.  That's great.  And then go home and get your fucking shine box?  No, it's not that good.  All right.  It's a cheesy movie.  Yeah, of course it is.  It's a close rule.  It's like Q&A.  The quotes in that, you never saw Q&A.  No, where do I find it?  I can't even find it on Netflix.  The fucking quotes in Q&A are fucking...  Are I going to go on the internet?  Nick Nolte?  That's Nick Nolte?  Yeah, and Timothy Hutton and Armand Asante and fucking Lament directed it. 
[02:28:00]  I got to see that one, too.  He's been telling me that for years.  I know, for years.  He's calling, too.  We want him to see the quotes.  I get on compel that racial talk.  You know me.  No, I know.  The few lines you told me were pretty racial.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Look out.  Trying to fucking watch myself.  I had a great little racial discussion with Keith Robinson yesterday about the Trayvon.  Oh, come on.  You fucked me, man.  About the Trayvon thing.  It was pretty fun.  Oh, Jesus.  We're going to have to go through that now?  Well, I'll let you guess who was on whose side there.  You actually won't believe it.  You will not believe who took what side.  It's amazing. 
[02:28:30]  It was great.  Oh, so there's a reversal of roles?  No, Keith was fully entrenched on the Trayvon side, no matter what.  Don't be crazy.  George Zimmerman was an asshole, and my side is, let's look at the facts and see what the  jury is going to have to digest.  Why do that?  Yeah.  Why not just throw rampant racial emotion into it, and we'll decide that way.  Reflexive political correctness is the way to handle those.  Keith is a good common sense guy.  Oh, it's funny.  Until it comes to that shit.  But he has a good street common sense for human behavior. 
[02:29:00]  And a lot of what he said made sense about, like, you know, if you behave this way, this  is how someone's going to react.  And, you know, Keith, he's a very fucking hair-trigger temper guy.  The thing is, a lot of people have such misconceptions about that case.  Oh, I know.  Oh, he was following him.  He was chasing him.  He was, you know.  Well, you had NBC Nightly News editing their fucking bits for the first half.  You think that might have fucking swayed some people?  Editing.  Of course.  Of course.  Guys using Final Cut for fucking two hours.  Yeah.  Freeing that story up.  So, uh, I was on Twitter after we had, uh, Robert Zimmerman was in. 
[02:29:30]  And we talked to him for a while.  And then, uh, I was on Twitter for hours, uh, after the show, just going at people, fucking  debating, debating.  And then yesterday, I get home, I look, and the first fucking tweet I see is someone,  well, you know, stand your ground law, this, that.  I just fucking, I took a, I took a picture of where I was, it was like, my knee in my  shorts, on my lounge chair, with the pool in the background, beautiful blue sky, I just  snapped the picture and put, not today. 
[02:30:00]  That was it.  Good for you.  Fuck that.  I'm not falling into your little trap today.  You'll be back at it.  It's a chore.  But you're going to be back at it today, because the weather's going to be shitty.  Shitty weather means I got nothing to do.  It's a guarantee that you'll be back at it.  The weather's going to be good around Carolines tonight, folks.  That's true.  I sure hope so.  There's a high, right over that building.  Right, right.  A high pressure system.  I feel bad for you.  I'm going to drive home and then drive back into the city.  I feel bad for you.  And you live in that area where all the fucking roads flood. 
[02:30:30]  Soft mill.  Oh my God.  A homeless guy pisses in Yonkers and it backs up to my house.  There's rivers that just overflow onto the highways.  We only pay, only pay 25 grand in property taxes and state and county taxes, you know.  Every time it rains, you guys are shut off from the city.  It's un-fucking-real.  You're just shut off from the city.  They can't figure it out still, huh?  What the fuck, man?  Hilarious trip.  Well, the mayor is enacting this new thing about climate change.  And apparently, he can't just say, look, we got hit with some shit with these storms 
[02:31:00]  and the city really took a beating.  The tunnels, some of the coastline and whatnot.  We got to fix these things.  He had to put in this thing where now it's costing billions and billions of dollars because  he wants to prepare New York for climate change.  For like global warming.  He has to politicize it, make it a thing.  Instead of saying, you know, having some fucking public works job where it's like, well, water  comes in here, all right, we'll fix it. 
[02:31:30]  It's got to be this philosophical, lib, fucking hoity-toity, you know, the global warming.  So, along with making barriers so the water doesn't come up, we need cleaner energy and  this and that.  You shut the fuck up.  China's belching out factories with goddamn coal that we were using in the 1800s.  Yeah, you mind fucking, I'm not going to be alive in 50 years when all your plans kick  in.  How about me tonight driving a Caroline, you cocksucker?  How about fucking eight hours from now? 
[02:32:00]  Can you get a plan for that?  You know, dinkweed.  When your plans kick in.  And you know it's going to take that long.  Mayor Liberace.  That guy likes peppers.  I thought we ran out of money in this city.  What the fuck is he talking about?  Spending it on bike racks.  I hate those fucking things.  Why wouldn't you?  Why the fuck?  What are we, Beijing?  Fucking.  I know.  I stink.  And you know what?  It's another fuck you to drivers.  It's another place you can't park your car.  I took a lot of cabs yesterday. 
[02:32:30]  I didn't realize how many they had.  I thought it was just a bunch.  They're all over the place.  They're, fuck yeah, they're all over the place.  And nobody's riding them.  I see three people on bikes delivering pizzas.  You see three empty racks.  You know, there's 50 bikes and three empties.  And he could put them on the sidewalk with this cocksucker, middle finger with average  people driving cars.  That's right.  He's a fucking pussy boy.  I really hate him.  Yes.  I think bicycles are great in this city.  Yeah.  Don't you think it's fabulous?  Yeah.  Isn't this wonderful?  Do you like the bikes a lot?  Do you like the bikes?  Do I make you happy, Scott, as a mayor? 
[02:33:00]  They're blue.  I blew Scott.  It's just all ties in.  City bank bikes.  What the fuck?  What the fuck is that?  Yeah.  Half of them don't work, right?  They don't have seats on them.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You see the garbage guys?  The pictures on the paper.  The transportation guys.  What are they doing?  Throwing trash right on top of the bike.  They can't reach the fucking garbage.  Oh my gosh.  I mean, what the fuck is going on in this world, man?  It's crazy.  It's just beyond me.  That's right.  Leftist douchebags are running it. 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  Yes.  It really is a very silly thing that he's doing.  They just had a picture of a lightning hitting Willis Tower in Chicago.  That was pretty impressive.  I know, right?  We don't know that lightning hits buildings at this point.  They love pictures of lightning hitting buildings.  Things we see all the time, but it's not a big story.  Well, this is a little interesting.  It came from a drone.  Another thing they're doing in the city, I guess, good old Attorney General Holder is talking 
[02:34:00]  about overseeing the NYPD over this stop and frisk stuff.  Because you know how into preserving constitutional rights they are.  So they're saying, you know, this infringes on people's rights.  Illegal search, I guess.  They're against that.  Yeah, and there's no history of it working, right, Anthony?  I mean, it's not like murder has gone down 3,000%.  If you look at big cities, New York is really an anomaly. 
[02:34:30]  It's an amazing thing that's being done, and I think it's a direct result of how the NYPD  deals with criminals in this city.  A lot of people don't like it.  A lot of people say they're racist.  And it does touch on you as somebody that really kind of likes the Constitution that there  is this kind of, we can stop you and frisk you, it does kind of stop.  It's a weird area. 
[02:35:00]  It's a dicey area.  Very dicey.  But boy, they sure know who the fuck they're stopping.  Well, they've been trained.  Stopping and frisking.  And you have people of color defending it.  That's all I need to hear is one person of color defending it.  Right, right.  I know I'm on the fucking right side.  You're on the right side right there.  That's all I need to hear, sir.  But it's true.  A lot of people are defending it.  It has cut down on a lot of crime.  I mean, these are, this is what, it's not legal gun owners that are fucking going out  there shooting up, trying to shoot their target and hitting grandma and fucking three kids 
[02:35:30]  in strollers.  Exactly.  It's fucking, Larry the Cable guy is on Lenox Avenue.  Yeah, look out.  Yeah, so, I mean, just more and more, this administration just poking their fucking face and everything.  Yeah, it seems like they're taking the Constitution and dancing all over it.  Exactly.  Exactly, Jim.  Sorry, it's not like you're Magna Carta over there in England.  I don't really know what you're talking about. 
[02:36:00]  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Dan.  You want to hear it?  What?  What?  Just go to the gym.  Just go to the gym and eating better.  That's Jimmy.  That's Jimmy.  Who are you talking to when you saw Ozzy?  I panic a little bit.  He instantly came up with an English fucking ass.  It was like fucking Madonna.  He's like, Ozzy's like, you lost a little weight, Jim.  How'd you lose the weight?  He has Jim.  Just go to the gym.  Just go to the gym and eating better.  And eating better?  Don't keep fucking...  Just go to the gym.  Just go to the gym and eating better.  Just go to the gym. 
[02:36:30]  But then it went away.  Immediately.  Thank God.  It went away immediately.  I'm at the fucking Jimmy Unwanker.  What part of Shastire are you from?  I don't know what happened.  Shastire.  We got it.  I love it.  It's hilarious, but it's a little creepy, too.  A little creepy.  It was kind of cool, though.  You guys do good fucking...  Oh, he's fucking...  Both of you do great fucking Aussies.  Oh, yeah.  He's spot on.  Jimmy's spot on with his accents.  Well, he's been listening to him since he was four. 
[02:37:00]  Everything he says, I'm interested in.  It doesn't matter what it is.  And you wanted to talk like him.  Like, you'd think Aussie would be like,  Oh, look, he's a bloke from my hometown.  No, it was more...  It's weird.  It was like a...  I don't know why.  It wasn't like I wanted to sound like him,  because I try to sound like me no matter who I talk.  I never do that when I'm talking to black guys or anything.  Yeah, yeah.  Never.  Sam does a little with black guys.  Yes, because he's got the DNA.  He was interviewing some rappers and stuff on his show,  and he's like,  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was like,  Oh, what's Sam doing? 
[02:37:30]  I don't do that.  I want to hear evidence of that.  Oh, it's out there.  I heard it on the way home.  I laughed like a black guy.  I heard it.  When I'm talking to black guys, I laugh different.  Really?  Like, say something like,  if you're a black guy, say something funny.  All right.  I just punched that white motherfucker right in the face.  You see him go down, motherfucker.  We got more Black Sabbath, by the way.  Oh, we've been holding back on this.  Oh, good.  I guess someone around here noticed that Jimmy might have said a word a lot. 
[02:38:00]  I think I did quite a bit.  Oh.  What word is that?  Jimmy gets nervous during interviews with people that he really loves.  Well, this was not an interview.  This was hosting the town hall.  Right, right.  Which, by the way, has to be said, he did a great job with.  Yeah.  He did a great job.  But he did say one word a lot.  It was in front of a live audience for anyone that didn't see it.  We had Tony Iommi on a thing called...  I'm doing one of those, you know, for a band.  A man without hats.  So, safety dance.  There's two guys left, and I'm going to...  It was corralling, you know, it's all those years of doing stand-up 
[02:38:30]  where you learn how to just fucking keep the audience, keep everybody engaged.  Yeah, crowd control.  Yeah, they were great.  They were having fun.  But, like, you know, with Ozzy and Gizzi and Tony and Brad,  everyone's trying to talk, it's hard to be in this fucking place.  You just get used to all these voices.  And jumping in, knowing you're going to pick a spot.  Sharon was happy.  That's all I care about.  Well, you said one word a lot.  I know I did.  A word that fit to the game.  Sharon Stone, here we go.  Here's the word.  Thank you guys so much for being here.  We have an amazing fucking night in store for you. 
[02:39:00]  It's going to be a fucking amazing night.  We have an amazing night because all of you people are here,  and the band wanted to do this in front of you guys.  We're going to show you the God is Dead video,  which some of you have seen.  It's amazing.  The system kind of pushed against Black Sabbath,  and now the system is going,  wow, we were wrong.  You guys are fucking amazing.  What an amazing job by Peter Joseph, right?  Brad, I want to ask you because you did such an amazing job.  Did you do anything to avoid rehashing stuff 
[02:39:30]  because you did an amazing job of not falling into that trap?  Because you were determined, and now here you are,  all these years later with the number one album  in fucking 50 countries.  It's just an amazing thing for a Black Sabbath fan.  We just finished the Australian tour,  and we did four lives.  That's Jim talking now.  Fantastic doing them.  Yeah, I was watching them,  and the people were reacting to them so amazingly well.  We are really, really happy for your success,  and for how fucking amazing this album is.  Look, I keep saying it, but you did an amazing job. 
[02:40:00]  You stayed true to the Sabbath sound.  Thank you.  Amazing fucking job.  Jesus!  That was, by the way, that was a 10-minute interview.  Amazing!  Yeah, I said that a lot.  That was a 90-minute span, though.  I was going to defend you, as funny as that is, of course.  When you don't bring you 90 minutes,  you string them together, though.  It makes for a fun little fucking minute.  But when the band has asked you to be a part of this,  it's the biggest thing they've done in years, 
[02:40:30]  and they trusted me not to fuck it up.  Oh, yeah.  It's just amazing.  Imagine if you were saying fabulous and say it.  Oh, my God.  Fabulous.  Ozzy Jim's amazed by you.  Scrumptious.  The album is scrumptious.  Oh, that would have been great.  If you had any other word, you would have been fucking...  Yeah, scrumptious would have been bad.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  I've never said that in my life.  No, no.  Not once, if I use the word wonderful ever to describe it.  Good for you.  It's wonderful.  It's a you-know-what life. 
[02:41:00]  I like that, though, that you were like,  amazing.  You really put it over the top.  I'll defend myself in one point.  In the intros, I did it...  The original intro I did was directly into camera,  and I thought I really fucked it up,  because I was kind of off script,  but I actually did pretty well with it,  considering I was nervous for the first couple seconds,  and I just relaxed and got into it.  So I had to do the same opening kind of for the YouTube live stream hangout,  and then I had to go up and do it in front of the audience,  which is what it went out. 
[02:41:30]  I had to do three different intros.  Yeah, yeah.  So I stood amazing in your life.  It was fun.  We should take a break.  Nick DePaulo's at Caroline's.  He's amazing.  He's amazing.  Bring your fucking umbrellas.  Come on out.  The rain's going to be amazing.  It's going to be great.  I'm going to be in a fucking wet fucking t-shirt.  Nick's wonderful.  He's going to have an amazing show.  That's so fucking lovely.  Do you do that?  Yeah, you tell the fucking emcee,  hey, when you bring me up, tell him I'm wonderful.  I hate that fucking thing.  Wonderful, Nick. 
[02:42:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get.  On the O.P. and Anthony Show.

[02:43:00]  It's too late now because here comes Uncle Paul.  We'll show you how to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul remembers playing Lost in Space.  I used to call you Will Robinson.  I'd go, danger, danger.  We'd hide under the covers together.  Because he had like really pale buttocks that pinch him so hard that my fingerprints would be in him.  Like little hunks of dough. 
[02:43:30]  Let me get in there and make the fudge soft.  We put some earl where the fudge comes out.  Make it come out smoother.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy standing there.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now because here comes Uncle Paul.  O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:44:00]  Continues.  Nick DiPaolo in studio playing Caroline's this weekend right here in the Times Square area.  Right on Broadway next to Nathan Lane.  On Broadway.  Yeah.  Nick is a fucking great stand-up comic.  Are you working on an album?  Is that what you're doing?  No, that's what I am.  I'm putting another hour together.  That's what we do, right, Jimmy?  That's great.  Hour after hour. 
[02:44:30]  I got a few new minutes.  It's all dirty, though.  So is mine.  Filthy.  Ooh, look at you.  What did we listen to there?  That was, you know, Kevin Bacon's band.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, Kevin Bacon's band.  Yeah, it's hard, man, because I'm working on a new material now, but I just keep starting  with the same 15.  I have like 15, 20 new minutes, but it's not...  Already?  Yeah, I mean, a lot of it's fuck jokes, and...  Yeah?  I mean, that counts, but...  Mine's definitely... 
[02:45:00]  This is a lot dirtier than I work.  Yeah.  Not intentionally, and it's still smart, but...  I mean, Jesus Christ, between the Michael Douglas throat cancer pussy-eating shit, and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  ...vaginal rejuvenation, I'm reading about that online, and...  Oh, that's good one.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all dark.  Do you want to see the singing vaginas?  What's that about?  You want to see the singing vaginas?  Who's that?  The Beach Boys?  It was one of my last...  I retweeted somebody.  They'd fucking...  You gotta see the singing vaginas, man. 
[02:45:30]  What the fuck are you, people?  This is what the internet was made for.  Says the guy with an eighth-month-old baby.  There you go.  Hours to retweet.  Oh.  Well, Sam's at the helm at the computer.  This should take hours.  How dare you?  Yes, Sam, you really are an incompetent.  Damn.  What are you looking for?  You should see me on the computer.  Yeah?  Useless.  Are you really?  Oh.  Do you...  Do you...  You got, like, a phone and stuff? 
[02:46:00]  All that shit.  I'm on, you know, iCloud.  Fucking wife's not explain that to me.  I'm like a two-year-old retarded.  So the computer's the boss of the phone, and they talk to a gentleman?  The boss.  The boss of the phone.  It's fucking horrendous.  Oh, like a child, yeah.  Yeah.  Sink this.  Steve Jobs.  Good fucking riddance.  It was a retweet from Keith from Philly.  It all gives you cancer, by the way.  Yeah.  Nothing?  My friends go, that's bullshit.  Really?  I had Steve Jobs die by a beer truck? 
[02:46:30]  I'm like an apple a day, my ass.  Oh, what the fuck?  Jesus.  Let me see.  What is that?  It looks like an ad for a deli.  What is it?  It's a singing vaginist.  What is it?  Thanks to Keith from Philly.  He won the internet last night.  What the...  That looks like Ed Asner's ear.  Yeah.  Ooh, child, things will get brighter.  Someone's got a bunch of strings hooked up to six points of vagina lips.  Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier.  And they're pulling them in.  That's disgusting. 
[02:47:00]  Ooh, child, things will get brighter.  What do you mean?  Disgusting.  You don't like that sound?  Did he show Scott, uh...  What's his name?  Oh, he don't like this.  Look, they're harmonized.  And they're hairy.  It's obviously a fetish sound.  The pussy's not really singing.  We'll walk together and we'll get it all done.  You know what's sad?  This is done for me.  What?  This is recorded in that basement in Cleveland.  You know what's amazing?  You know what's really amazing? 
[02:47:30]  It's very funny, man.  We spend 99% of our time trying to get that.  I was just thinking.  I was just thinking that.  That's some ugly vagina right there.  It looks like a fucking Ultimate Fighter's earloaf.  That just goes to show how good that shit feels.  Because it could just look like that and all we want is that.  I thought it was Chuck wetting his eye.  This is what you get if you follow me on Twitter.  There you go.  Singing vaginas. 
[02:48:00]  If you opened up a clamshell and saw that, you'd throw it away.  Holy fuck.  It's a little dry, that one.  Yeah.  It's a little dry.  Hey, this one doesn't open.  No amount of Tabasco and lemon is going to help that.  That's fucking gone.  Why all the hair on the side?  A lot of hair on these girls.  And it's on Vimeo.  Yeah, is this the Supreme?  Vimeo takes themselves very seriously and they allowed this.  There you go. 
[02:48:30]  What girls agreed to this and who's pulling the strings?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Obama.  He's pulling all the strings, people.  Very good.  Wow, that's something.  That is...  Thank you.  And it's got a great video we've got to talk about.  Well, it's a little documentation, video documentation of something that happened at my party last Saturday.  Which you brought up on Monday.  Yeah, yeah.  The Steve from Bayshore thing.  Wow.  You've got to tell Nick.  We saved this for Nick.  Yeah, I had a big party Saturday.  A lot of people came over and of course, you know, booze is flowing.  I didn't hear about it.  Go ahead. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, shit.  Next time.  Jesus Christ, Nick.  Please.  So, music was a little loud.  As I pointed out.  Yes, as Jim pointed out to the DJ and told him to turn it down like a fuddy-duddy, like  a curmudgeon.  I was trying to talk to my friends and I could feel it bouncing off my eardrum.  So, Jimmy told the DJ to turn it down a little bit and he did, but I guess not enough and  he turned it back up.  So, about close to 1 a.m., two Nassau County cop cars pull up to the house. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, shit, huh?  Good party.  And, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They called me first.  Now, this isn't Shirley?  And that wasn't your name?  Yeah, Shirley.  Yeah.  Well, they called me.  They called me on my phone, which was odd.  Yeah.  I guess he had been to my house before.  And I came outside.  I told them the music was off.  It's cool.  So, me and the two officers and another guy, NYPD guy, Mike, are talking.  There's two cars.  One's in the driveway right there with his lights on. 
[02:50:00]  The other one is off to the right of the screen.  You can't really see it.  It's kind of in front of that car that you see there.  Plus, it's a small screen.  Yes, yes, very small.  We see it bigger.  Yeah, yeah.  So, uh...  When I watch it, yeah.  But I mean when we do.  Yeah, yeah.  I promise when we do, you will.  So, we're on the lawn talking.  Two cops and me and another guy.  And, uh, Steve from Bayshore.  Comes staggering down the driveway.  He's a stumble body.  Now, who is this?  He's a regular guard?  Friend of mine.  Oh, friend?  Yeah, friend of mine.  All right.  Uh, staggering.  He had been drinking whiskey all night. 
[02:50:30]  He stops, um...  You can see in the video, he stops and just bumbling.  But he's trying to get his keys out.  At one...  Let me continue and then I'll tell you what...  Watch the video and then I'll tell you what happened after.  Out of frame.  I have another camera that covers that angle.  But here comes Steve.  Now, you can...  Oh, Jesus.  He's doing that goose step.  Whoa.  He's doing the goose step.  And that's a cop car he's walking right toward.  That's a cop car right there.  Whoa.  He stumbles to the left.  He's doing it.  He is.  Wow.  Now, you know what he's doing right here? 
[02:51:00]  Right.  Getting his car keys out.  Right, Chip.  He just took his car keys out of his pocket.  And that's what made him go to the left.  Oh.  That movement made him go to the left.  That's right.  Yeah.  Now he's going.  And now we noticed him.  And we're like, Steve, if you think you're going to drive, you probably picked the worst  fucking time to think you're going to drive.  So more staggering.  He goes to this car, which, by the way, isn't his car.  God.  Tries to get into that one.  Then he goes to the next car up in line and tries to put the key in that door.  But that was the Nassau County cop car.  You're fucking kidding, though. 
[02:51:30]  The cops are fucking laughing hilariously.  And we're just like, Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  He finally goes to his car, the passenger side, gets in the passenger side, just sits  there.  So after a few minutes more of talking to the cops, we, with the cops, went over.  They put the flashlight in his face and opened the door.  And there's just a puddle of puke outside the car door.  And we're like, Steve, get over.  Come on.  You're not going anywhere.  What's he, in high school? 
[02:52:00]  It was a hell of a party.  Let's just say.  Jesus.  I guess he was doing shots.  Nice party.  But I guess, you know, when you're that hammered, staggering, and you start seeing police cars,  probably go back to the house.  Turn around.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, I forgot my piece.  Back to your house.  Yeah.  Yeah, the staggering's great, though.  You can really see.  He's doing that leaning back too far goose step thing.  Yeah, here he goes.  And then, whoa.  Yeah, he looks like a football player that gets dinged. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  You fucking...  That's a great video.  Yeah, that's a fun one.  Security cam.  Steve.  You tweeted that shit yesterday.  Then I realized, holy fuck, I got security cam in everything.  The backyard, the pool.  You're like Tony Montana.  Roland, I know.  Scanners.  10% of our adjusted gross.  That ain't fucking peanuts, okay?  I got, you know, scanners.  You probably unintentionally got shit on everybody now.  Probably do.  Yeah.  Because of your cameras.  I know the backyard cam there with the pool. 
[02:53:00]  I probably got Roland in there in the pool getting harassed because he can't swim.  He didn't want to go in the deep end.  Did you get complaints from your neighbors about the music or anything?  Yeah.  That's why the cops show up.  It's one neighbor.  One fucking bitch.  The only one with ears.  This is true.  Okay?  In high school.  Some guy moves in next to us, right?  And he's a complete dick.  He's complaining about, the guy across the street is like a 78-year-old Italian rufa.  Still works like 80 hours a week.  This guy's complaining about his trucks being in the driveway. 
[02:53:30]  Just a fucking dick.  So my parents are having a cookout.  Listening to like Neil Diamond.  He comes over into our yard at the cookout and tells my father to turn on the music.  And I see my father being real nice.  And I go, uh-oh.  My mom's like being over nice.  I go, this ain't going to fucking...  Oh, no.  So that was on a Saturday.  Sunday morning, I hear I'm sleeping.  I wake up, Austin.  I hear fucking yelling and swearing.  I lift my shades. 
[02:54:00]  My father is in that guy's yard.  They're both on the ground.  My dad has them in a headlock.  Fucking, they were jarring at each other.  And I'm trying to put my fucking pants on and shit.  And I was just stunned.  And my, you know, my old man's like, get him in a headlock.  The guy's on top of my father.  My father's choking him.  I guess they had some words.  Yeah.  Just to fuck it.  Yeah, that escalated.  And then I'm walking to like, I don't know, CCD class on a Tuesday night.  This is like two weeks after it happened. 
[02:54:30]  And the guy's, you know, it was raining.  He slows up and asks me if he wanted to ride.  I go, fuck you, you jerk.  Oh.  Coming into my, coming, he was in the neighborhood about a year.  Yeah, yeah.  My dad's been there his whole life.  Comes into his, you know, on our property.  Tell us to turn down the bucket.  It was like Neil Diamond.  But why did he wait till the next day to put him in the headlock?  Because, I mean, he's entertaining friends and shit, you know.  Oh, I see.  We're not anymore.  Did he turn the music down? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, he turned it down for about four minutes.  But then he felt insulted, obviously.  And then he's like, I'll take care of this tomorrow, is what he was thinking.  No, exactly.  That's for a way.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, yeah, the slow Sicilian revenge.  Wow.  You know, that rowdy, hot August night music was really fucking...  That's what it is.  I got one neighbor that just doesn't like parties.  Doesn't like music.  No, no, no.  You got one neighbor that's not scared of you.  That's what it comes down to.  I would assume the other ones aren't digging the music either. 
[02:55:30]  Well.  Because you don't invite him over.  He doesn't give the fake invite.  They're old Jewish people.  Like, I'm having a party if you want to come over.  They're old Jewish people in my neighborhood.  Maybe they don't hear the music.  Get some fucking belly meat.  Some brisket.  Yeah, I'll get some fucking kugel and fucking matzah.  You should send it over the next day.  Like, ah, sorry, it's a little loud.  Here's a little something.  Yeah, exactly.  No.  That's a picture of you.  You got to do a kugel search.  I don't know.  It goes no.  Why?  I don't have time for that.  No.  You got people for that.  I don't have time for that. 
[02:56:00]  People for that.  And then when I wanted to see what the neighbor looked like, because the bushes are a little  too high for me to peek over the fence, I sent my fucking little hexicopter over  with the camera over the house during a party and had the camera fucking...  You got drones enough?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy, do I ever.  Yes, he does.  And a dinosaur.  That's on the site there.  Where do you get this shit?  Which one?  Sharper Image?  Yeah, go to the one...  He started at Sharper Image.  Did he?  That's what got him hooked.  No, the next one over there.  Like a good drug.  You started with the little pod, and now he's... 
[02:56:30]  It's a gateway?  Oh, he's got heroin now, man.  You don't need the music, right?  Oh, no, we do need the music.  Oh, it's very epic.  This is my driveway.  This is popping up in the air.  I want one of these.  They're great.  That's it.  A driveway?  That's what it looks like.  What the fuck?  I fucking pull up the landing gear.  That's a drone.  It's hilarious.  Look how high up this is.  Nice snowy day.  It's got a camera gimbal that stabilizes the shot.  It's just fucking amazing.  All right, how much?  Thousands.  How much? 
[02:57:00]  It's a lot.  You're talking bottom-of-the-line thing.  You could probably fuck around a couple of thousand, but if you want, like...  That's it?  But if you want the autopilot and fucking all the bells and whistles, it's going to get  up there.  Yeah.  Ten?  You could hit ten.  Yeah, definitely.  I'm making 75,000 to sell it.  Put ten thousand to do what?  See the tops of the trees in the neighborhood?  You can't do anything with it. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, yes, I can.  I see my neighbor over her fucking trees.  This is fucking fabulous.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah, he's only going to...  That's my neighborhood.  He's only going to post a safe video.  That's my neighborhood after it.  It's amazing.  Snowstorm.  Nice.  After snowstorm, yeah.  You can see the parkway over there.  And, uh...  You motherfucker.  Yeah, there's Northern State Parkway.  And then some neighbors and whatnot.  Do you use this for traffic in the morning?  Yeah, I do a little traffic report. 
[02:58:00]  It's a lot of fun.  Let's go to Anthony.  I had it go down on me.  I had it crash on me once, though.  And it landed, like, in between the expressway and parkway.  And I had to find it.  Oh, it's horrifying.  You almost hit traffic.  Really?  This is sick.  What's the range?  It could go pretty fucking far if I send it out autonomously.  I don't even need to control it.  I'm fascinated by this.  I could program waypoints on my computer.  It'll just fly there and come back.  If it has any difficulties with the radio signal,  it automatically comes back and lands from where it took off from. 
[02:58:30]  There it is.  There it is up in the...  Why don't you just get a job at the fucking CIA?  It's fucking good.  Who says I don't?  That's the camera angle.  That's the view I see from the ground.  So I could see where it's going.  I could fly it without having to look at it.  You just fly it first person.  Right out the camera view.  This is a toy.  This is an adult toy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's better than a dildo.  It's great.  That's like...  This is what I do.  I figured, I'll buy some toys and have a little fun.  Isn't it amazing?  You should tape a couple of your guns to it.  You won't get any more complaints about the music. 
[02:59:00]  Exactly.  Imagine that.  You'll lob a few shots in into the neighbor's house on this thing.  That's unbelievable.  It's just coming back in.  And then just come back in for your little...  Amazing.  ...for a nice, easy, gentle landing.  Look, that's Bobby Collins' house.  I got the retractable landing gear because it got in the way of the camera.  So you got to...  I had to upgrade.  All right.  This is something I want.  I have to...  You want it, right?  This is a repeat oven.  I can't...  It's so...  There it is.  Now the gear come down.  And, uh...  That's kind of creepy.  It comes in for a landing.  It is. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  People don't know what the fuck it is.  I had those in my pubic care when I was a teenager.  That's so...  There you go.  And a little soft landing in the driveway and everything's fine.  How big is that?  What are the...  What's the wingspan?  It's about this big around.  It's like about three feet.  Yeah.  Anthony put his arms out like he was hugging E-Rock.  Yeah.  Well, no.  I'm sorry, Rock.  Is there a assembly required, Anthony?  That's why I have a jumbo jet at home.  Assembly required.  Yeah, yeah.  Battery's not included.  You kind of learn a few things along the way.  Is it a little more complicated than my pillow?  A little more. 
[03:00:00]  It's adjustable, too.  But it's a little more complicated.  I've, uh...  Yeah, I've flown that thing all over the fucking neighborhood.  It's...  People...  I want that.  I got a clip of the pizza delivery.  We've got to go to other locations, though.  Yeah, yeah.  It's been too windy for months.  Take it to all locations.  It's been too windy for months.  I want to see that in the city.  Well, I'm going to fly it with a banner saying Nick at Caroline.  Please do.  That'll work.  That's fantastic.  Competing against the biggest rainstorm in the last 10 years.  Jesus, Nick.  Horrible luck. 
[03:00:30]  I think you'll do all right, though.  I'm hoping that Sunwell gets closed and I can't get there.  But it's not going to be the whole weekend, though.  No, just from 8 to fucking 9.30.  Tonight, right?  In Times Square.  Tomorrow should be much better.  It'll clear up right around quarter of 10.  Yeah.  It's about to hit Washington, they're saying on the news.  Is it?  El Doritos?  I don't see any footage.  I'm not seeing any footage.  I don't see anything, either.  I think they're fucking fibbing us.  Yeah, what the heck is this?  That's just much to do about nothing.  I've got to go back to work. 
[03:01:00]  What the hell do I know?  Much ado.  Much ado about nothing.  What's that, Sam?  Much ado about nothing.  Really?  That's right.  No, it's much to do about nothing.  He's regular Joe.  You're wrong.  Much ado.  No.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's not much ado, you fucking boob.  Much ado.  Now that you say it, I think you're right.  Much ado.  It's not looking up.  If there was the only way we could figure that out.  Yeah.  If you say it with an English accent, like Jimmy.  I bet you it's both.  It might be both.  But much to do about nothing. 
[03:01:30]  In West Orange, they say much to do.  In East Orange, it's much to do about nothing.  Yeah, but no one says that.  Everyone says much to do about nothing.  It's a play that it's all based on.  It's based on a play.  Much ado about nothing.  Shakespeare's much ado.  That's right.  Much ado about nothing.  Yeah.  Into the breach, you motherfuckers.  Much ado.  Much ado about nothing.  Uh, you know.  All right, with these fucking Dr. Oz tweets.  What is that about?  I didn't want to bring it up on the air.  It's just spam.  It's spam.  I'm getting that, too.  No, everyone's getting it. 
[03:02:00]  It is.  They're fucking up Twitter with that shit.  Whatever this product is, diet.com slash, like, dash, extract, dash, article.net, whatever  that product is, people should fucking really let their website and Facebook know how sick  and tired you are of fucking, uh, dealing.  They don't care.  You just helped them out.  They don't care.  You just got, you just put the website out there.  It doesn't matter.  They don't give a fuck.  If everyone airs.  They will get sales.  I tried the product and I got very sick on it.  That's right.  It will, uh, it will give you, uh, rectal cancer. 
[03:02:30]  That's, uh, that's where Scott got it from.  No, but, you know, it's seriously, it's, uh, if they have nothing but hate stuff on their  thing, believe me, companies pay attention to that.  They may get some traffic, but if everyone's tweeting and going, you suck, fuck you, stop  with Twitter, your product, believe me, they're not going to be happy with that.  Their whole fucking sales gimmick is made up of spamming places.  Right.  You're going to make them stop doing that?  Yeah, no.  It would never work.  You're playing into their hands.  They love it.  Unfortunately.  And if you go and voice your complaint on their site, you're probably going to get cookies 
[03:03:00]  on your computer.  Right.  They're just going to ravage it with more.  Well, those would be delicious.  Cookies on your computer.  What the fuck?  Cookies.  I know.  I don't know what cookies are yet.  It's a small little fucking.  You don't want cookies on your computer.  They can listen to your shit.  Cookies are dangerous.  I know that from the Sopranos.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, what are these fucking cookies?  Speaking of listening to our shit.  It's a very difficult situation.  With these fucking cookies.  Hey, Syl.  Hey, cookies.  How you doing, hon? 
[03:03:30]  I love that.  What did you want to do?  I, you know, T, I, what did I do?  You could stop fucking off.  I love when he does that.  How the fuck did he turn into fucking...  I was trying to think of the black impressionist.  It's just thievery.  George Kirby.  I know, the guy on the internet that does him.  That guy is fantastic.  What's his name?  I want to give him a plug again.  He fucking plugged us.  He made a video for us. 
[03:04:00]  He is so good.  When he was doing fucking...  We've got to get him in here.  I don't know where he's from.  Christopher, too.  Hey, T, what's the matter, T?  He's so fucking good.  He nailed all of them.  Vince Vaughn wasn't down there.  Yeah.  Hey.  But we're going to whack you on something.  Oh, Chip.  We've got someone that wants to explain a do.  What's his name again?  I'm sorry.  Mark in Ohio.  Mark.  Oh, Max Koch.  Hey, guys.  It's been an awesome week.  Yeah, I read an article about that shit. 
[03:04:30]  I can't...  I can't remember what it's called or how to pronounce it.  El Doche or whatever the fuck it is.  Anyway, the article I read explained it as basically...  Oh, E-Roc's yelling in my ear because there's a problem here.  Basically, in a hurricane...  But hold on.  Hold on, Mark.  There's something else going on here because the guys behind the scenes are yelling and  screaming in my ear right now because it said that you called because you wanted to  explain the whole much ado about nothing. 
[03:05:00]  And now you're talking about the El Dorito store.  Yeah, he wasn't saying El Doche or whatever it is.  He was saying El Doche.  Oh, they must have...  I don't know, man.  Now you don't.  I don't know.  I've been talking about it.  Oh, boy.  Enjoy Cincinnati.  Another stellar call.  Another amazing...  Holy shit.  I love it.  Gotta defend the guys in that one.  I know I'm gonna get my bike in.  That's his name?  The guy that does...  Max?  Yeah.  Yeah, Max Koch, I guess. 
[03:05:30]  Isn't it pronounced something weird, though?  K-O-C...  Coke?  Coke, maybe.  Max Koch?  I think it does say cook.  Cook.  Yeah, whatever the fuck.  You got one we can play?  Whatever the fuck.  The original one's the...  Fucking deadly, man.  Do you remember which one was the really good one over the top there?  Not the Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you think I'm gonna be nice?  We could play the Opie and Anthony one.  Fuck it.  You think I'm gonna be fucking calm?  We never played this.  He was happy we gave him...  This combination.  Hand your fucking ass to you, I guess. 
[03:06:00]  Get up!  Right.  He looks like him, too.  Get the fuck up!  Tony, why are you in my bedroom?  Don't you fucking Tony me.  Come on.  Get up!  Why are you in my bedroom?  You never mind that.  You was on the Opie and Anthony show this morning.  They talked about your sorry, sticking ass for 20 fucking minutes.  They played a lot of clips.  So what the fuck are you gonna do about it?  It's not how I think.  It plays a lot of clips. 
[03:06:30]  You gotta make a response for your son.  You gotta let him know you appreciate it.  Ow!  Where'd you come from?  You better do something on the Twitter thing, too, you know?  Tweet, tweet.  Do you hear what I said?  Tweet, tweet.  Bob?  Twitter?  No.  No.  I don't Twitter.  You don't do Twitter?  Why not?  Easy, Phil Spector.  Okay?  I don't have to explain myself to you.  Would you three get out of here? 
[03:07:00]  I'm exhausted.  I was on a bender last night.  I'm hungover.  Please, get out!  All you fucking do is sleep and drink.  He's right.  You hear me?  That is true.  And yank on your dog!  My God, man.  Get a hold of yourself.  Fucking waste of space.  Just like AJ.  You remind me more of him every fucking day.  It's not true.  It's so dead on.  That's funny. 
[03:07:30]  I may not make YouTube videos much anymore, but I work on cartoons now.  That means something.  Oh, Max.  You got any peanuts?  Uh, suddenly I'm in the mood for peanuts.  Ooh!  Bob wants peanuts.  Okay.  So, according to YouTube, Max, you haven't made a video since November 2012.  You hit a cowboy hat, dancing in your panties.  1,258 views.  Terrible.  Exactly. 
[03:08:00]  It's not my fault.  My YouTube videos went to shit.  I don't get respect on YouTube anymore.  I really never did.  He's no Brock Barker, this kid, I'll tell you that much.  Well, now you're finally getting a boost from Ogre and Anthony.  Okay.  OB!  OB!  Whatever, you stupid shithead!  Somebody shoot me in the throat, please.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Max.  You've been doing this YouTube bullshit since 2008. 
[03:08:30]  Opportunity is knocking on your fat fucking head.  What are you doing about it?  It's good.  Nothing.  I love it.  He's right in me, buddy.  He's fucking perfect, Tony, man.  You're gonna make a response video, or I'll fucking kill you.  Tony!  Don't put me to the test.  I'm leaving on vacation with my wife.  I need a break.  I'm burnt out.  I'm leaving on vacation with my wife.  I'm leaving on vacation with my wife.  Jesus.  Christ, you're a fucking pussy.  He's right. 
[03:09:00]  You hear me?  That is true.  Dead on Tony's surprise.  I can't believe this is happening.  Well, you better stop believing.  Don't stop believing.  Huh?  All right, fuck Twitter.  Just make the fucking video.  Do you tweet?  Anthony.  You should.  Oh, you want me to tweet now?  No!  Tweet this!  Ah!  You got me!  Oh, by the way, Max.  Obi and Anthony hated your fucking Pauly Walnuts. 
[03:09:30]  I thought it sucked.  Frankly, I couldn't agree more.  Work on that one.  Holy fuck.  Great writing, man.  It's good.  It's funny.  Is he getting work?  Does someone please tweet this video to them?  Ah, that's fucking great.  So put that on our Facebook page.  His videos are great.  Is he getting work?  I guess he does cartoon work.  We don't know much about him.  There's some shit, which is, you know, for voice guys, pretty fucking good.  So let's get the word out.  He should call the show at least.  Yeah.  I don't know where he lives or any of that shit.  His Sill is great, too. 
[03:10:00]  He does a good Sill.  I was going to say.  Great Christopher.  I like to see Pauly.  Yeah, and his Christopher is good.  Can we see him do Sill for a second, Sam, instead of fucks around over there?  Yeah.  Sam was right, by the way.  It's much ado about nothing.  I was wrong.  Much to do is said, but it's an incorrect thing, I'm sure.  It's said by dumb Americans?  Yes.  Like myself.  What's that, a brand new one he put up six days ago?  Yeah.  Oh, it's Nicholson.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Let's see.  Let's see.  It's either going to be good or awful.  All right.  I do a good Jack, but.  Vroomtang.  Vroomtang. 
[03:10:30]  Hey.  Hi, Jaws.  A little slow tonight, isn't it?  I'm glad you asked me that, Jaws, because I just so happen to have three fives and four  singles right here in my wallet.  He's doing a new Jack.  I'm going to be here until next October.  So here's what.  You're going to slip me a nice, tall, frosty fruit shake in a glass with some milk and a 
[03:11:00]  lot of ice blended berries.  Now, you think you can handle that, Jaws?  You're not too busy, are you?  Why is he the Jaws character from 40 years ago?  Yeah, from 40 years ago.  Hey, Jaws, it seems I'm temporarily light. 
[03:11:30]  How's my credit in this joint anyway?  No charge?  Orders from the house.  I'm the kind of man who likes to know who's buying their fruit shakes for him, Jaws.  Anything you say, Jaws, anything you say, or don't say.  Jesus.  Who's that? 
[03:12:00]  He's supposed to be Jaws from James Bond 40 years ago.  What a fire truck just drive by in the back and he had an improv.  He had to work it in?  Yeah.  All right.  We get it.  We get it.  It goes on for a while.  It's a long video.  Where's the... 
[03:12:30]  It's a good Nicholson one.  Where's the one with fucking...  Silver and Christopher.  He doesn't do well much?  Not well, no.  He does.  This is the one with...  Let's see, part two.  Christopher.  Christopher.  He does a good Christopher.  So what the fuck's this now, T?  Another fucking fever dream?  Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, Christopher.  Give me a fucking break, you camel nose prick.  I practically lost my whole fucking crew. 
[03:13:00]  You didn't lose me, Tone.  Not by a long shot.  You kissed my so-called fucking camel nose and put me to permanent sleep after that accident.  He does a great job.  You were a fucking menace to yourself, Christopher.  To your wife, to your daughter, and especially to fucking me.  Fucking menace to society, right?  I'm the fucking problem?  All right, take it easy.  Jesus fucking Christ, Christopher.  What the fuck?  I mean, what if it wasn't me in the passenger seat when you was driving on age or whatever the fuck? 
[03:13:30]  We can't watch all these full lengths.  He could do fucking loping.  It's fucking great.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, if somebody was sick or...  Holy fuck, that's dead on.  That Christopher is as good as his Tone.  That's unbelievable.  Holy shit.  No.  Jimmy, you're doing your show today?  Yeah.  Oh, you are?  You're doing the advice show.  I had to, yeah.  That's the one with Melfi, which is kind of funny, but...  All right.  We should...  We've got to step aside from Jimmy's show.  Yeah, Jimmy's show.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, do it a little bit of stuff. 
[03:14:00]  Selvie.  Yeah, see, here goes on my list.  Fuck.  Girls need new songs.  Toiless need clean.  Fuck, that's what I...  Fuck.  Motherfucker futuristic fuckbox. 
[03:14:30]  Fucking good.  Selvie.  What the fuck are you doing over there?  It's his fucking computer.  What about it?  Ever since the coma, my brain's been a little foggy, so I got the computer, so maybe you  would help me with the books. 
[03:15:00]  Alas, the motherfucker's out to fuck me.  Better not be anything incriminating on there, my friend.  It's funny.  Like a tongue.  Oh!  All right.  All right, take it easy.  Jesus.  Wow.  You think he watched the show much?  Right.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  His mannerisms are dead on, too.  Yeah, you turn into the fucking burner.  Holy fuck.  He looks like Tony when he makes the face.  I love when he does that, like, makes his eyes, he makes small, looks his side, does  that thing.  Yeah, it's fucking great. 
[03:15:30]  We'll put that on the Facebook page there, E-Rock, Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  It'll be up there for you.  Max Cook, it looks like, right?  Cook.  Cook.  Cook.  Cook.  Cook.  Cook.  Cook.  Cook.  I think he says cook, though.  What's that cook?  What is his YouTube...  Bowler hat.  Doesn't Jim Cook spell it like that?  Bowler hat.  Sammy Adams.  Bowler hat on YouTube.  Yeah.  All right.  Nick DePaulo's at Caroline's, man.  Eight o'clock tonight.  Bring your rank outs.  You fucking canoes.  Yeah.  Whatever the fuck. 
[03:16:00]  And clement weather.  You heavy pads.  It's good seeing you, buddy.  Thank you for having me, kids.  Absolutely, Nick.  Always a pleasure.  Fucking laughing.  You guys are...  And stay tuned for Jim Norton.  Yes.  Yes, I'm saving lives here, people.  He does.  I listen on the way home.  It's fucking amazing.  It's very intense.  It's amazing.  It's very intense with Jim Norton.  Amazing.  All right.  Later.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  But Jim Norton is not going anywhere.  If you have problems at a phone, it's your lucky day. 
[03:16:30]  The Jim Norton Show is next.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor.  And your chance to speak directly with him has a life.  Call 866-969-1969.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now. 
[03:17:00]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  Is there anything better than this theme song?  The answer is no.  There's not.  Hi, everybody.  Yeah, I was not able to do it yesterday.  I was shooting promotions for my epic special, which airs at the end of August.  And they're a very good company to work for.  They take really good care of comedians.  And they really give me a lot of creative leeway.  Like, they did virtually no interference with the material or suggestions of the special. 
[03:17:30]  And for the promotion, they paid for the promotions.  And they pretty much let me do what I want to do.  So that's why I did not do this yesterday.  Because I was there until about 7 o'clock at night filming.  So we have some callers already.  Now, I'm just going to go to this guy, Ken in Fairfax, really quick.  Now, what are you saying?  Why apathy wasn't considered for the Sabbath album?  Yeah, because Vinny Apathy was what happened.  Oh, apathy.  I'm sorry.  It says apathy here. 
[03:18:00]  You didn't understand.  It's Vinny Apathy?  Yeah.  To be honest with you, what the guys have said, and I've asked them about that, was it was totally a Rick Rubin call.  I think, you know, Ozzy works with Tommy Klufotos.  I always say his name wrong.  But I think Rick wanted, because Tommy, I'm guessing, is more of a metal drummer.  I think Rick Rubin wanted the old school sound, which is like a blues jazz influence, much heavier blues.  And I think that's why he wanted to go with someone like, you know, Brad Wolk from Rage. 
[03:18:30]  Now, are you a big Sabbath fan?  Love them, dude.  I have, you know, the Black Sabbath, like, demon logo.  I have that tattooed on my back.  Okay, good enough.  Now, we had Ozzy and Geezer in the other day.  And Best Buy, I think this is from Best Buy, and I didn't do, that's why I'm mentioning it now, had this great box set with the DVD and the shirt.  There's a shirt in here.  It's like a limited edition thing. 
[03:19:00]  And so I'm going to give it to a fan, and I actually got Ozzy and Geezer to sign it.  So if you just stay on the line and give Sal or somebody your address, I'll make sure this gets sent out to you, okay?  Oh, man.  Thanks so much, Jim.  All right, brother.  Enjoy it.  It's a great, great CD.  All right, man.  Take care.  I hail Black Sabbath.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  Okay, let's see.  Wow, Tim in New Jersey.  Let's just say your father was sober.  I don't like to, you know, mention program names, but your father was sober in a 12-step program and started drinking again.  Yeah, he was sober for three years, and he just quit cold turkey. 
[03:19:30]  He just decided, they told me I had fatty liver.  He was going to basically die if he didn't stop drinking, and he stopped.  And recently he's retired within the last two weeks from work.  He's raising my sister's kid who's now a teenager, and they just sold her house and are moving, and they went to Italy with some friends.  And he said when he went to Italy, he was going to drink wine and just be okay with drinking wine.  And I told him, I said, I don't think that's a good idea.  And since he came back, it was just wine, and then now he's started drinking booze again. 
[03:20:00]  Of course.  He called me, you know.  Let me ask you, let's just say, was he going to a 12-step program, or was he doing a totally cold turkey?  He did a cold turkey, and then he was just going to alcoholics and anonymous meetings.  Okay.  I told him, once he started drinking again, I said, did you tell your sponsor?  And he said no, and then he said he's starting to have health issues again, because it's been for, I don't know, the past eight months, I would say, he started doing it.  And, you know, he says, well, I can stop any time I want kind of thing, and he's not. 
[03:20:30]  I know he's not.  He's in denial, obviously.  Now, do you go to any programs that are, like, Al-Anon is a program for people who are closely related or deal with alcoholics.  There are programs you can go to that are for people who are living with the addicted people or love the addicted people, and their addiction is affecting your life.  Yeah.  You can go to one of those Anon programs, whether it's Naranon, Al-Anon.  And there's a whole bunch of them, because you're not going to stop him from doing what he wants to do. 
[03:21:00]  But it will teach you how to not be a part of the cycle that you're a part of.  Not that it's your fault, but, you know.  Oh, no, I don't live at home anymore.  You know, I've been moved out for years.  I've got my own kid.  I just, you know, I can see it happening, and I try and approach him, and then he'll shut down and he won't talk to me.  And I understand what's going on, and I try and rationalize with him, you know, but I just don't know.  He's got a month where he just retired, like I said, and he's trying to get his stuff together.  He said, I'm going to have fun for a month, and then I'm going to quit. 
[03:21:30]  So, but I don't know if that's just, you know.  It's bullshit.  It's obviously, I'm going to have fun.  He's got a fatty liver, and he considers dumping more of that stuff into his system and disappointing his family as fun.  Like, that's the insanity of it.  So, my only suggestion would be you've already spoken to him.  You're not going to be able to make him do anything.  Either do an intervention with somebody if there's enough people in your family or his friends that feel it's a major problem.  And really, try a 12-step program that's something anon, maybe Al-Anon. 
[03:22:00]  Even though you don't live there, it will help you more than you know.  Yeah.  Okay, buddy?  All right, cool, man.  Thanks.  All right, I hope your dad turns out okay.  Now, do we get off this guy that works with his dad, is afraid to go to ask for help?  No.  Is he still there?  Yeah, he's there.  Where's his name?  Hello, sir.  Mike.  Yeah, I'm here.  Hi, Mike.  What's going on?  First off, big fan, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thanks for taking my call.  Thanks, man.  I'm a closet addict, pretty much high-functioning.  Okay. 
[03:22:30]  And I've been using heroin for, God, like three years now.  And I had a hard time finding a job out of college, and I ended up going to work with my dad.  And he's an executive at a pretty big auto lending company.  And the problem is right now, I want to get help.  I'm so sick of this lifestyle.  I'm so sick of spending all my money and just living horribly.  And I just am so afraid that if I, because I'm going to use the insurance for work, I'm just 
[03:23:00]  so afraid that word will get out, and it's just going to, like, ruin my dad's reputation.  And just, I mean, I don't know what it would do, but it wouldn't be good.  And I just want to know what you think about that.  Jimmy Carter's wife, Jimmy Carter, who is the president of our country, his wife has a place called the Betty Ford Clinic.  It's, you know, embarrassing your father by eventually overdosing or by getting arrested for heroin possession. 
[03:23:30]  One of these things will happen.  You've been lucky.  You're a high-functioning guy.  So you haven't had those immediate effects, so you've been able to keep it a secret.  But something devastating is going to happen.  Better your father is embarrassed, or what you think he'd be embarrassed, by his son going for help,  realizing you have a problem and going for help, than by something else happening, because something else will happen. 
[03:24:00]  When it comes to this, if you had cancer, you wouldn't be embarrassed to go for chemo.  You would do it.  So this is a sickness that you can arrest if you do the right thing.  You can do something about it, and you don't need to worry about your father, because he's not the one, ultimately, who you have to worry about.  You're an adult.  If you're going to use his insurance, use his insurance.  If he's mad at you and he disowns you as his son, which, of course, I don't think that will happen, well then, you know, fuck him. 
[03:24:30]  How much does he love you anyway if he's going to do that?  You know, but the important thing is that you get help.  That's just something your sick part of you is telling yourself, here's why I can't.  The crazy part of you thinks it's less of a risk to do heroin than it is to tell your dad and use his insurance.  Think of how crazy that is.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's good advice, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Fuck the embarrassment.  That's my advice.  Fuck the embarrassment.  Go and get help and get sober, and anybody that judges you or judges him, fuck them, too. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Fuck them.  Cool.  Okay?  Do the right thing for yourself.  Appreciate it.  You know, you're not going to, what, are you going to be proud and dead?  Silly.  Humble yourself and go get some help.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Okay, buddy.  Okay, let's see.  How about Joey in Georgia?  What do I think about breaking traditions in, let's just say, the 12-step program that I go to?  Yeah, Jim.  Well, I've been sober for about five years, and I have the opportunity to listen to the radio a lot, 
[03:25:30]  and I hear a lot of these celebrities, you know, breaking the traditions and breaking the anonymity.  Yeah.  Sounds like to me you do a very good job at trying to stay away from that,  and how do you sit there and listen to some of these guys when they do that?  Well, it's their prerogative to do so.  Let's let, you know, when you go to programs or anything you do, some places love you to talk about them,  and other places request that you maintain personal anonymity,  and I respect that request.  Now, it's not breaking tradition to say I'm sober or I go to a 12-step program. 
[03:26:00]  That's perfectly acceptable.  I just choose not to name certain ones, and maybe some people know what it is, and maybe you don't,  but I honor the tradition because the tradition is for a reason.  So these fucking asshole celebrities that run around breaking their tradition are just,  or regular people that do publicly need to read the traditions and realize,  hey, motherfucker, you're not special.  The anonymity is requested for a reason, you egomaniac douche.  So respect it, and stop using the fucking name of the program when it asks that you don't. 
[03:26:30]  So what do I think?  I don't hate them for it.  I just think they're fucking shitheads, and, you know, they're just pompous assholes,  and they think that they know.  So personally, I respect the question.  All right?  I mean, the request for anonymity, I respect that.  Yeah, thank you so much, man, because I get a little resentful,  and I sound like you've got a strong opinion about the program, too, and you care about it,  and you make me feel a little bit better by showing your ass.  Appreciate it. 
[03:27:00]  Okay, buddy.  Thank you very much.  All right, man.  A lot of the same call, a lot of this theme coming in today.  Matt from Boston, having a tough time in life, recovering alcoholic.  A lot of recovery questions today.  Yes, Matt?  Hey, Jimmy.  It's really good to talk to you.  I am.  Hi, buddy.  I've been having a tough time.  I, you know, the last couple weeks, I've been kind of unraveling, you know, emotionally,  and, you know, my loneliness is really high.  You know, um...  How long are you sober?  I've been sober three years.  Okay.  And, you know, I got sober at 19.  Um, you know, kind of like you, you know, you're a young guy when it happens, that's 
[03:27:30]  why I come to you with this question.  18, yeah.  And, uh, you know, I, I, I kind of feel like, you know, uh, I'm a pussy nowadays, you know,  that, like, I'm not as, you know, tough, and, um, I can't deal with life.  You know, this, this last couple weeks, I've been, you know, pretty, um, you know, beside  myself.  Uh, and so yesterday was kind of the icing on the cake.  Like, you know, I, I, uh, I got fired from my job that I started maybe a month ago.  Okay.  Like, um, you know, my life's totally unmanageable, sober. 
[03:28:00]  Um, uh, you know, I, I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm, I'm still active in my fellowship.  You know, I, I still hang out with my sober friends.  Okay.  You know, and the thought of the drink just comes back.  And, um...  Sure.  It's crazy.  It's kind of insane.  You know what I mean?  Do you work, let me ask you, do you work any suggested steps, let's just say?  Uh, to some extent, you know, I, um, I recently, you know, I, I, I had a guy I was working with,  um, and, you know, that didn't work out so well.  That happens. 
[03:28:30]  I've been, I've been trying with that.  You know, we got our own little, uh, private, um, you know, blue book group that we go to  and, you know, we, we do that and it's, it's kind of cool.  Well, let me jump in for a second.  You know, I, I, cause they, they say that, uh, a lot of times you'll notice that, uh, you  know, there, there comes a point where, and I was told this earlier when I started getting  sober, you're going to hit a wall and you're going to think, is this all there is?  Is this it?  And what that means is there's, it's time to do something else.  Meaning there's some kind of, uh, uh, thing to grow that I need to do. 
[03:29:00]  I'm, I'm not, I've kind of, it's like when you work out, your body adjusts to the workouts.  If you just do the elliptical every day, that works for a while.  Then all of a sudden you hit a wall and your body just stops losing weight.  So you have to switch up the workout.  Well, that's kind of how it is with being sober.  It, you get to a point where, all right, maybe, maybe, you know, sometimes you need to help  somebody else, uh, maybe do something for somebody else and getting fired sucks.  First time I ever got fired, dude, I was five years sober or two years sober or two years 
[03:29:30]  I was, um, working in a lamp company and I'd never been fired drinking or drugging, but I  started doing standup and I wasn't coming into work and I got fired sober.  It happens.  You're 22.  You got a lot of years ahead of you.  It's one of those things that like, we talk about life on life's terms.  Sometimes you just have like a little rough patch or a shitty patch.  It's okay.  But you know, the thought of a drink is crazy because the insanity is this will, this will  turn around of course.  And then when things are going great, you're going to realize, Oh fuck, the thought of a 
[03:30:00]  drink just hit like, that's how it works.  It does.  It's circumstances don't matter.  It hits us when we're weak and we're weak when we're not doing the right thing sober,  which might be going to certain meetings or helping people or talking to people.  And, uh, whatever it is, dude, it will pass.  Just don't give up and give into that silly thought because it really is crazy.  You've got three years.  Just, you know, sometimes they say just put one foot in front of the other and act as  if, and, uh, you know, bring the body and the mind will fall.  Just do the right thing.  Even if it's just the next right thing, you know what the next right thing is? 
[03:30:30]  Maybe go out, look for the job, just go out, you'll, whatever is going to happen, you'll  find it, but it ain't going to be like this forever.  Right.  Okay.  But just don't give up.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  I love you.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Good luck to you.  Okay.  Let's see.  Uh, uh, uh, oh, let's see.  Uh, I'm sorry.  I'm marital problems.  Mike in Colorado.  I just want to get away from recovery just for a second, just to talk about something else.  Uh, hi, Mike.  Hey, Jim.  I love you.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, um, I've been, uh, I had, uh, Oxycontin. 
[03:31:00]  And, uh, Percocet, um, addiction.  I got through that and, uh, then, um, had a, had a, uh, Barrett O'Farrell on my wife.  You had an affair on your wife?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  And she doesn't know about it.  And, uh, since then, um, you know, I've been clean for, for over four months now.  But I, I, every day I get the what ifs.  What if you're doing this?  What if you're doing that?  What if, what, what if you're, you're taking it and I don't know? 
[03:31:30]  What if, you know, what if you're seeing somebody?  You know, just go with her.  You know, and, and, and, and it's, it's really dragging me down.  Well, are you obsessed over her cheating because you did?  No, she didn't cheat.  I cheated.  No, no, no.  But aren't you saying what, what if, what if?  Are you saying that about her or is she saying it to you?  No, she's saying it to me.  Oh, I'm sorry, but I misunderstood you.  She keeps questioning you.  Yeah, she questions me and, and just, is, just what if you're taking it and writing it? 
[03:32:00]  So you're sober, you're sober four months.  How long ago did you cheat?  That was three years ago.  And how long ago did she find out and how'd she find out?  She found three, she found out three years ago.  Okay, and how'd she find out?  She saw the picture of the girl on my phone.  Okay, so it wasn't like you just came and confessed her.  She peeked around or poked around and found something.  Right.  So, you know, don't forget you've only got four months clean, so it might take you a while. 
[03:32:30]  Now that you're clean and sober, you will probably regain her trust, but give it some time.  It's a lot easier to trust somebody who's totally sober and, and, and coming clean about things.  But don't, don't, it's annoying for a while, but realize, you know, sometimes they say the  shit hits the fan when we're drinking and we got to clean it up when we're sober.  So maybe the shit hit the fan and now the shit's laying all over and you got to just keep scooping  it up and cleaning it.  And they say clean up the wreckage of the past and, uh, we do a lot of damage to people 
[03:33:00]  when we're being deceitful and deceptive.  So sometimes, I mean, it will come a point where it's being ridiculous for her to do  that, but I would say give her a break if you're just getting sober and she has stuck  with you through all this and, uh, you know, give it some time.  And then if it doesn't change at all in time, maybe you address it, but you're still  newly sober.  Well, yeah, uh, I mean, I've been sober for three years now.  Oh, I thought you just said four months.  Well, uh, well, um, that, that's how long it's been going on.  She's just been going on and on about it. 
[03:33:30]  It seems like it's getting worse.  Oh, wait.  So you're sober three years.  You have not regained her trust.  And, uh, for the last four months, she's going on about you cheating, cheating and doing  drugs.  And do you think she's doing anything deceptive?  No, I don't.  Huh?  Well, have you sat down and talked to her?  Maybe she never worked out the resentment.  Oh, yeah.  I kind of think that that's the issue and I've been telling her about it.  And she's, you know, well, we, we constantly have arguments and hang up on each other. 
[03:34:00]  And then she says, she's sorry.  She won't do it again.  And then the next time we talk, she does it again.  Do you think that she's not comfortable that things are going good?  Sometimes people don't know how to handle things when, but it's good.  People sometimes need conflict and need controversy.  That's why they hook up with us to begin with.  People who need that emotional rollercoaster a lot of times seek out, you know, subconsciously  alcoholics, drug addicts, because they need this fucking craziness.  And a lot of times we get sober and we stop doing the fucked up things and they don't know 
[03:34:30]  how to handle it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, I was a quiet guy when, when we got married and, and, and now ever, ever since that  affair happened, I'm a little bit more outspoken because I get sick and tired of the, of the  comments that she says I've changed ever since then.  And, um, and, uh, it's just because of the comments, I get sick of the comments, sick of  the, oh, just go back to her or, or, you know, um, you know, it, it, it, it's really dragging 
[03:35:00]  me down and I'm trying to keep myself lifted up and doing the right thing.  And, um, you know, she has stuck with me, but, uh, I, I'm just kind of wondering, I mean,  how long do, do I put up with this where it, you know, I mean, we've been married almost  25 years now.  Have you tried going again?  I suggest therapy a lot because sometimes getting both people in the same room when you're 
[03:35:30]  married and I've never had that experience, but maybe there are things you could both  talk out in front of somebody where maybe whatever's bothering her or that secret resentment,  she, maybe she doesn't know she still really resents you and maybe she never totally forgave  you for it.  So if you try couples therapy, that could help, or maybe, maybe you'll decide not to be together,  but it beats going at it the way you are.  Like if you're both just kind of going at it alone and bouncing off each other angrily, maybe  you go to a therapist and you talk it out together. 
[03:36:00]  And sometimes the therapists, what they do is they just help me or you or whoever it  is, raise the right questions for ourselves.  Sometimes they just say, well, what do you think it is?  And they really force you just to think about things and to talk things through properly  without shouting at each other and without being accusing and slamming the bedroom door.  Possibly that would help.  That would be my suggestion because maybe it's just going to keep getting worse.  So I would suggest trying therapy together and seeing if that works for you.  I will do that because, you know, we did go to therapy right at the beginning, but then 
[03:36:30]  we stopped.  Yeah, maybe you should try it again.  And it has gotten worse.  So I think maybe we need to go back and try that.  All right, buddy.  Give it another shot, my friend.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I love you.  Thank you so much.  Ryan in the Bronx has a daughter, has not talked to his father in 15 years.  Ryan, I'm a little out clear here.  Jimmy, what's up, buddy?  Hello, sir.  Yeah, I have a three-year-old daughter, and I haven't talked to my dad in going on like 
[03:37:00]  17 years, 15, 17 years.  And he's just a bad dude, you know, like not really abusive, just like he's a drunk and  a pain in the ass, you know what I mean?  Okay.  And so he kind of, you know, he just was like, we used to be afraid of him when we were kids,  just like, you know, the harassment.  But as we got older, I was just kind of like stepped, I just forced him to the background.  And I'm happy with like not having him involved in my life.  But I still, you know, I keep in contact with his side of the family, my aunt and uncles and 
[03:37:30]  stuff, because they're great people.  And so I had my daughter up there at my aunt's house, and she was like, kind of hinting to  me about like, you know, your father's been asking about you and stuff.  And I kind of like told her, like, I prefer that you don't mention anything about me.  Just say that I'm fine.  I don't want you to even tell him that I have a daughter or anything, you know, just because  he's like, whatever.  But then I started to think, like, if he passed away, I don't know.  Like, I mean, am I doing a disservice to my daughter? 
[03:38:00]  Like, I think, does she deserve to meet her grandfather?  But on the flip side of that, I feel like, I don't know.  Well, let me ask you, let me ask you, now, is he still drinking and doing what he was  doing?  Yeah, I would say so.  Yeah, I mean, I think he still, you know, drinks a few beers and gets on the phone and  call.  He lives out of state, so he'll call in the middle of the night and, you know, but people  just, he's getting old now and he doesn't have to, he's not as scary as he used to be.  So people just kind of just, you know, ignore him now. 
[03:38:30]  But have you thought of me, again, and that this is, again, sometimes it's better to not  be in touch with people that you don't want to.  If you're, if maybe your resentment is totally justified and your lack of interest in him is  totally justified, or maybe, you know, now that he's older and changed a bit, maybe  you, because if you're thinking already, what would happen if he died, maybe a little  resolution would help.  And maybe you don't have to involve your daughter in it.  Maybe, you know, if he has a number, maybe you can just give him a cell phone instead  of your home phone so he can't wake you. 
[03:39:00]  And maybe you could meet with him and have lunch or have dinner and just see what his  personality is like.  And if it's the same old shit, then you can go, you know what?  I can close the book on this now.  I gave him a chance and he's the same guy.  And now if he passed away, I won't have to wonder what if, what if, what if?  I mean, if you're, if you're questioning that, you might want to meet with him by  yourself.  Yeah.  Cause like we, him and, you know, me and him were, we were buds.  Like, you know, it wasn't, we never really had like a father son relationship, but for  a long stretch there from like 14 till when I was about 20 or something like that, like 
[03:39:30]  we would hang a lot, you know what I mean?  And we'd go, you know, have a couple of beers and smoke a joint and it was more of a  friend's relationship thing.  But what finally pushed you away from him?  Uh, he, um, Mike, my, my grandmother had passed away.  My mother's mother.  And, um, it was the night of the funeral and he, he didn't know, but he was just doing his  regular, you know, he, he would, uh, not talk to us for a few weeks or whatever, but  then he would call and he called and like, we had just got back from the funeral and  we were, everybody was settling down. 
[03:40:00]  We had some family in and I called and my mother was like, you know, making kind of the  gesture, like it's your father.  So this is when I, years ago, like I said, I was still living at home, uh, so I got on  the phone and I just kind of respectfully told him, like, listen, you know, this is what  happened.  And, uh, you know, it's not really the best time to do this.  You know what I mean?  And he was just like, oh, you know, am I supposed to cry for your fucking family?  Nobody cares about me.  And yeah.  He's a self-centered ass.  He's a narcissist or self-centered ass.  Yeah.  And I was just like, you know what?  Like, I didn't even get angry.  I was just like, I've just had enough of this dude, you know, at this point. 
[03:40:30]  So.  Well, maybe, you know, again, it's not like he was punching you in the face.  And I'm not saying that you should get back with him, but maybe if you, if you have,  if you're questioning yourself and it's been this many years, maybe you just, um, you know,  have lunch with him and see how it is and make the decision there and don't commit to anything.  Right.  Yeah.  Cause my, I, my sister, I have an older sister that has two kids and I know for a fact, like  she would never, ever give him the opportunity, you know, cause she just didn't, I think she  was old enough to remember when he was living home and he was, how bad he was.  Right.  So, uh, so, uh, you know, I, I, I don't know. 
[03:41:00]  I guess I always had like a little soft spot for him cause he was like, he was like kind  of like a straight dog, you know?  So, but, uh, I guess, I guess you're right, man.  I guess I would definitely feel it out with him before I even involved my kid.  Yeah.  You don't have to have him out of the house for a weekend.  Just go meet him somewhere and then have lunch or dinner and you don't have to tell him  anything you don't want to tell him.  Yeah.  The thing is, is that he, you know, he's out of state, you know what I mean?  He's in the Midwest.  So it'd be kind of, yeah, it'd be kind of like a, like I would consciously have to make  like a, a trip like on the weekend and be like, I'm just going to either get an open 
[03:41:30]  ended ticket.  It can either go three hours or three days.  Yeah.  Or maybe, yeah.  Or maybe you just, uh, maybe you just talk on the phone once or twice and see how it  feels.  And if it feels bad, then you don't do it again.  Yeah.  Right on.  I, Hey, you do a great job at this, man.  You read, this is really like a, you know, you found your niche here, man.  I mean, you're a funny dude.  And then, you know, there's a real sincerity when you talk to people and shit like that.  So I, I, I think you help a lot more people than you realize, you know, thank you, brother.  Good luck to you.  Take care.  All right.  Whatever with that guy. 
[03:42:00]  Thanks.  Um, and what a perfect time to do this read.  And, uh, father's day is here.  Perfect segue.

He's actually going to use a dollar shave club.com gift card, dollar shave.com ships amazing razors  right to dad for a couple of bucks a month.  It saves him from schlepping to the store to buy stupid overpriced razors.  He'd rather be calling and annoying his family. 
[03:42:30]  They don't want to talk to him.  Dad hates wasting time.  And you know how dad hates wasting money.  How many times has dad told you that?  I hate wasting time and money.  I heard you, dad.  This father's day show.  Don't you actually listen?  Seriously, dollarshaveclub.com's razors are excellent.

[03:43:00]  from all their great products.  Because, you know, your father shaves.  Maybe he doesn't shave his face, but maybe he shaves his arm because he's a swimmer.  Or his chest because he's a closet homosexual.  Or his pubic hair because he's trying to recapture his youth.  Or maybe he shaves his hiney because he likes to go to peep shows and show his hiney off.  Whatever your father does with razors is his fucking business.  It's a perfect gift.

Dollarshaveclub.com really is a great gift.  Now let's talk to Wayne in Georgia.  Your mom is going to leave your dad and your father has no idea what should you do.  Hello, Wayne.  Hey, buddy.  Hi.  Well, I mean, I'm sure he probably has an inkling of what's going on.  But they've been married about 27 or 28 years. 
[03:44:00]  I'm grown.  I have a daughter of my own.  I kind of live my own life.  How do you know she's leaving him?  She told me.  And why did she tell you before him?  Well, that's why I was confused.  And I asked, you know, why would you tell me something?  It was like a family kind of get-together thing, which made it even more awkward.  She had a couple of drinks.  Okay.  And her family lives down in the southern part of Florida.  And she's going to go visit in the next week or so.  But in actuality, she's going to go look for a place and all that other kind of stuff. 
[03:44:30]  So she told me, and my dad thinks they're kind of going through somewhat of a little rough patch just because my brother and I are out of the house.  They're, you know, they're just by themselves and whatnot.  But anyway, she told me that.  My dad has no clue.  And it's kind of weighing on me a little bit because when they've been over since, they've, you know, they kind of act like they get along.  But it's kind of just a false, you know, to see their grandchild.  I wouldn't personally do that.  You're wondering if you should tell your father or not, right?  Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I mean. 
[03:45:00]  I feel like if he knew, if he finds out that I knew a week, I just don't want to have to jeopardize our relationship because we get along great.  Well, look, you're in a weird position.  She put you in a very awkward position.  Do you betray your mother or let your dad personally, and again, venturing a guess, I would say stay out of it simply because I think it was inappropriate of her to tell you first.  But the fact that she did, who knows what's going to happen. 
[03:45:30]  Let's just say she goes to Florida and let's say she looks around for a place and doesn't find one.  And then all of a sudden he makes the right phone call and she goes, you know what?  Fuck it.  I want to stay.  I don't want to leave.  Then all of a sudden they stay together.  He never needs to know that she was contemplating this because she didn't do it.  But let's just say that you tell your father and then she's having second thoughts.  That might fuck the marriage up.  I think that even though you want to be loyal to both people, she made a judgment error by telling you. 
[03:46:00]  But I don't think that you should get involved because they are two adults who are in a marriage, even though they're both your parents.  And it's not like you caught her, you know, blowing a gentleman in the car.  She told you she, you know, so it's not like you've discovered her being deceptive.  I would let it play out the way it has to between those two because you're not being a liar by not telling him.  You're just not breaking the word of your mother.  And if your father ever goes, how could you not have told me? 
[03:46:30]  Dad, what if all of a sudden she changed her mind?  I was afraid that you would jump the gun and I would wreck the marriage.  I didn't know what to do, I think is a very fair response.  Okay.  Yeah, I guess that's what I appreciate that because I was just kind of wondering what my line will be when I get accused of that.  And that's what I'll, that's what I'll.  Yeah, that's what I, because I think that's the truth.  And I think that's the right thing to do, you know, is, you know, let, let, let them play it out because it might not work out the way you think, good or bad, you know?  Yeah.  Good luck, buddy.  Thanks, man.  Sure. 
[03:47:00]  Hey, Dean in Alabama, relationship with two girls, one love and the other sex.  Hey.  What's happening, Jim?  What's up, buddy?  Man, I'm dating two girls, one of which is like the great partner.  I mean, we have great conversations.  We kind of have similar career paths and we're just, you know, pretty successful and have great time with her.  But the other girl, it is purely sexual, but the sex is amazing.  And, man, it's gotten to the point where the girl that I love and I want to marry, man, I can't even function with her anymore because it's just so, or the sex with her is so boring. 
[03:47:30]  And I've tried to do different things to get it more.  Yeah.  But the other one is just, I mean, it's the sex is on a different, you know, plane, you know?  Dude, I'm telling you, fucking the kooks always works.  Kooks are great ladies because their inhibitions are down.  Let me tell you, I've dated women.  I personally, I need to have good sex before I can even love somebody.  I do not, this is my advice, do not marry the girl until the sex is right. 
[03:48:00]  Because you love her, but you also love your buddies.  And I know men have this Madonna whore thing.  So either break it off with the great fuck and try to make your good girl the really dirty partner.  Because you might not be trying as hard as you think because you know you have that one in reserve.  Because I have the safety net to fall back on.  Yeah, man.  It's almost like you might not, deep down, you might not want to corrupt her or push her or have those talks.  Because, hey, if I want my ass eaten, I'll go to Betsy or whatever the girl's name is. 
[03:48:30]  But let's just say your girl's names are Edna and Gertrude, to keep it legitimate and believable.  Edna fucks you really good, fingers your ass, calls you, tells you she'd rather be fucking a Puerto Rican and you'd get turned on because you're a cuckold.  And then Gertrude is loving and looks you in the eye and is a good partner.  I would not marry Gertrude until she fucks like Edna.  Or until you can dump Edna and then be happy with the sex with Gertrude.  Man, the difference between the two is amazing.  I've never been in a situation where, man, one, honestly, I will, like, fuck her four times in a night. 
[03:49:00]  The other one, I can be around all weekend and maybe get one erection all the time I'm around her.  Yeah, dude, I certainly know that.  But part of the erection thing, dude, might be because you know you have that other one.  So that might be remedied if you dump the great fuck.  But again, it might not, and then you lose a great fuck.  Yeah.  It's hard.  It's really hard because a great fuck, is the great fuck a maniac or you just love the other one more?  The, you're going to laugh at this, but the great fuck is actually a preacher's daughter. 
[03:49:30]  And she's so judgmental and hypocritical about her, she's all judgmental about her Christian views.  And I can't stand talking to her about politics or about anything else.  But, dude, she fucks like a beast.  But then when we're not in the bed, she keeps telling me what a sinner I am and fucking how I'm not living right.  And she's just a bitch about her little uppity views.  Well, you may be able to get the fucking, the psychotic preacher whore daughter.  You might be able to get her to lighten up as she gets old. 
[03:50:00]  How old is she?  She's 23.  Yeah, maybe you can get her to loosen up a little bit and point out, look, you're letting me eat your ass.  You're not exactly fucking godlike.  You're not, you know.  Or maybe you can get the other one to fuck back.  But you have the Madonna whore.  That's what men want.  And you don't have it in one woman.  You have it in two women.  So it's a difficult decision to make.  You have to decide what's more important to you in the moment.  But personally, if you're talking about I want to marry this one, I would never marry anyone.  I'm not saying she has to be a savage in bed. 
[03:50:30]  But if you can't get hard with her, that is going to cause problems because you will cheat.  Yeah.  All right?  Yeah, that's true, man.  Thank you so much, Jim.  I'm a big fan, man.  You do great at this advice just because you're so nonjudgmental, man.  And it really means a lot to us.  All right.  Well, you're going to hell either way.  So God bless.  That is true.  And I've been told that in bed.  Good, buddy.  Take care.  Good luck, my friend.  Biggie in California.  Now, plays with his girlfriend's ass into anal, but she won't get into penetration.  Ooh.  Maybe it's your name, Biggie.  Maybe she's afraid you're going to rip her asshole into quarters. 
[03:51:00]  Biggie, hello.  Good morning.  Hi, buddy.  Yeah, so she lets me eat her ass.  Of course.  And I play with the ring while we have sex.  Sure.  And she's interested in getting into insertion.  And I've looked at the training anal kits.  Do you recommend those or do you have your own personal recommendation, Jimmy?  I've never used a training anal kit.  The way I do it is I'm like, hey, let's try a little bit of bondage.  And then you tie her hands and you tie her feet. 
[03:51:30]  And then you say, now you know what you're going to do?  You're going to get a shitter full of discipline.  And I climb on and I give her the fucking, the Liberace-ing.  I fuck her like, like Thorsen fucked Liberace.  That's what I do.  I give it to her deep and hard in her butthole.  And then I roll off and we laugh.  No.  I would suggest you eat the ass, you work the finger in, and maybe you work another finger in.  Don't push her.  You know, that's a big step for a girl to take a dick in her ass.  You know, give it a little bit of, if she's willing to let you eat the ass and finger it, 
[03:52:00]  she'll probably take dick eventually.  But you don't want to push her and make her all gunshot.  You don't want her, like now when you finger her ass, you don't want her to go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You know, you want her to enjoy it.  How about you slap the ass a little bit with your dick?  Fuck her doggy style.  Pull your dick out and then just rub it between the cheeks and let her know.  Go, I'm not going to put it in.  I'm just pressuring.  I'm just rubbing.  And then let her feel that like head pressing against her asshole.  And then be true to your word.  Push a little bit in, maybe an eighth of an inch, and then just go into her pussy. 
[03:52:30]  Don't lie.  Don't say, I'm only going to slap it on your ass and then try jamming it in up to your bag because then she won't trust you.  Maybe while you're fucking her doggy style, I would say take it out, rub it between the cheeks.  Maybe let her feel that pressure, that nice, dull, thick pressure against the ass a little bit.  And she may want a little bit more.  And maybe she'll relax with your cock against her ass because you do it a couple of different times.  So when you begin to gently push in, she trusts you and she knows you're not going to hurt her.  Oh, that is great advice. 
[03:53:00]  Thank you, Jimmy.  Good luck, my friend.  And make sure you suck out the cum after you fucker because that's the sign of a good man.  Just made that up.  All right.  Good luck, my friend.  Now, let's see.  18-year-old going.  I'm sorry.  Not you.  In love.  I want to talk to deploying soon.  What should he do?  Mehdi?  Is that it?  Mehdi in Baltimore?  Yeah, it's Mehdi.  Hello, Mehdi.  Hi, Jim Lorton.  I'm a big fan of yours.  Thank you so much. 
[03:53:30]  Thanks for taking my call.  Sure.  Yeah, I'm deploying two months with the Navy and I have batshit crazy in-laws.  How long are you with her?  I'm sorry?  How long are you with the girl?  Well, it's at least four months, but it could extend.  And, well, my wife's great-grandmother had Alzheimer's.  Her grandmother, she's showing early signs of Alzheimer's, but she's definitely the craziest  one. 
[03:54:00]  Sure.  And her mom, you know, she's kind of like the same way.  And I don't know if in the future my wife is going to become the same way because it's  obviously...  Sure, it's hereditary, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's hereditary.  So her uncles are like that.  They're crazy rednecks.  And I don't know...  What are you not sure of?  I'm not sure you're not sure of.  You're going to deploy.  You love this girl.  Her family has Alzheimer's.  Now, you're saying what should you do?  How long will you be gone for? 
[03:54:30]  Well, I'm going to be gone for at least four months, but should I trust her?  Because this is the first time that since we've been together, we've been married for  a year.  This is the first time that I'm going to be gone for more than two months.  Well, look...  Should I trust her with my finances?  Should I trust her with, you know, not cheating, first of all?  She's your wife, right?  She's your wife.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're married.  We got married about a year and a half ago.  Well, I don't know this woman, but I'm going to say that if you're in the military... 
[03:55:00]  Military relationships do very well.  Sometimes they break up, but so do marriage as a year.  I would say if you're going to trust her...  Do you have any children?  No.  Okay.  Well, then maybe you should try to trust her, and then if she fucks you and she does not  prove to be trustworthy, at least you don't have kids involved.  But I don't think you can go through a marriage wondering, can I go away?  If you were going away for five years, like, you know, Midnight Express, you have to jerk 
[03:55:30]  off on her tits into a window, I'd say maybe.  But if you're going away for some basic training and then some duty, I mean, shouldn't you be  able to trust your wife with your stuff while you're going into the military?  I mean, if you're married, you're supposed to be together for a long time, so if you can't  trust her, there's a major problem.  If you can...  God.  Yeah, I do agree.  I did trust her.  I do still trust her.  But her family, like, when we got married, and then we moved into this house that's, like, 
[03:56:00]  right next to her grandmother's house, and I got to see them outside of, you know, the  one once-a-week visit when they behave, you know?  I got to see them when they're in their normal environment, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Well, you live with this woman.  They're not important, dude.  The family's not important.  Whether she's going to cheat on you or steal from you, you live with her, you marry her,  so you know her.  Now, if something inside of you is saying, don't trust her, then you shouldn't have married 
[03:56:30]  her.  You might have made an error.  Just make sure that you're saying that because of her and not her family.  Because a lot of people are great people that come from fucking dogshit families, and  there's a lot of pieces of garbage that come from great families.  So the family's an indicator, and it can help, but it's not going to decide whether  she fucks somebody while you're in the military, dude.  I don't believe that at all.  Her grandmother having Alzheimer's and fucking going, who are you, is not going to determine  whether this girl steals your money.  Yeah, that's true.  So good luck, man.  And you're always right.  I'm not always right, but I say sometimes you got to, you know, I wouldn't judge her by 
[03:57:00]  her family.  You can learn a little bit from that, but believe me, if you rely too heavily on the family,  you're going to make mistakes because she's not going to be as predictable as you think.  Yeah, thanks, Patrick.  All right, buddy.  59 years old, involved with a 33-year-old.  Is she really into you, or are you crazy?  Dave, up in Boston.  Jimmy, how are you?  Hi, buddy.  Congratulations.  26-year difference.  I like that a lot, my friend.  Relax, relax.  I'm 51, not 59. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  I fucking phone screener has fat thumbs.  All right.  That's still 18 years.  Good luck, my friend.  So what is your question?  Is she into you or are you crazy?  Uh, you know, the problem is that she's a freak, okay?  And so am I.  I mean, I'm really into, like, the BSDM thing and, uh, she, and it's really cool.  Uh, but I just, you know, I'm like, I get to points where I'm like, oh, fuck, why is  this girl with me?  I mean, it's not like I'm fat and I'm overweight.  I'm actually in pretty good shape, but I just, I don't get it. 
[03:58:00]  And, and I've said it to her before.  I'm like, you know, and she's like, that is really unattractive and you need to stop.  Yeah, I was just going to say, stop saying that shit.  Do you dominate her or does she dominate you?  No, I dominate her.  There you go.  Okay.  You're dirty.  She's dirty.  You're older.  Um, you probably hit that button in her.  That's, uh, she likes an older guy who's going to control her and dominate her sexually.  You're doing what she wants.  Take your dumb self-esteem, which I have to keep it to yourself because what she likes 
[03:58:30]  about you is there's something maybe daddy-ish about you, or maybe she just likes the way  you fuck or the way you control her or the way you fucking spank her, whatever she likes.  Don't blow it.  Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't be yourself.  Like you don't always have to be, you know, hi, I'm master cock walking around with a leather  vest and a leather hat, but don't, but don't destroy the wall by going, oh, gee, what  are you seeing me?  Yeah.  Don't blow, let her enjoy you.  You'll figure it out, but just keep fucking her, have fun with her, keep dominating her, 
[03:59:00]  and take that low self-esteem shit and keep it to yourself because...  Let me ask you something, though.  Sure.  Okay, so there's another issue in here, too.  We've been going out for probably about, uh, maybe two months.  Okay.  And, uh, I've been together or gotten together with her probably about six times, and I have  only gotten half a rod every time.  Yeah, because you're not, you don't feel like you deserve her.  This is what I'm, the fucking thing is, you're thinking too much.  Are you going to please her? 
[03:59:30]  Are you going to be enough for her?  Uh, does she turn you on?  Oh, yeah.  Get out of your head.  You're in your head too much.  Maybe take a Cialis or a Viagra if your health allows for that.  But, uh, dude, you're in your health, your head too much.  Nothing will kill an erection like your brain.  A fucking, believe me, barbed wire doesn't wreck my dick the way me going,  I'm not going to be able to please her.  I've got to have my nipples played with.  I'm not going to be good enough.  She doesn't like me.  She's going to see that I'm a fraud.  Blah, blah, blah.  My fucking head can kill my dick. 
[04:00:00]  Stay out of your head.  You're listening to an idiot.  Listen to her.  Her and her wet vagina are going, you're okay with us.  And you're going, oh, gee, no, I'm not.  Don't listen to that, dude.  If she didn't want to fuck you, she'd leave you.  Yeah, you're the man.  Enjoy.  Thank you, my friend.  And I apologize to the people we didn't get to.  We have sleep apnea.  We have a shell and an attic back in my life.  There's too many of you.  The show is just not long enough.  So I apologize.  It's not that I didn't want to get to you guys.  But I have to wrap up.  But please call back next week because I hate leaving people on the phones. 
[04:00:30]  Simply because the gift of advice is a nice gift to give.  That's not necessarily the best gift to give a woman in your life.  Now, this 51-year-old who just called in, he gives her his cock.  And he spanks her and he slaps her clit.  That's a good gift.  The best gift, though, for any occasion or no occasion at all, just to say, hey, what  the heck, is an I love you gift.  Now, what is an I love you gift?  You're all saying that, Jim.  What's an I love you gift?  It's a gift that says, without words, how much she truly means to you. 
[04:01:00]  It says how much you love and appreciate her.  And more importantly, how much you value her.  It's something she can keep forever and look at every day to remind her of how much you  love her.  She can look at it and go, oh my God, am I a lucky gal?  He loves me.
