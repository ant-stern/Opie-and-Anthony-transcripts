<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The June 24th, 2011, Opie and Anthony Show began with a brief introduction by Larry King before Opie and Anthony took over.  The show heavily featured the film "Horrible Bosses," with Opie praising it as superior to "The Hangover" and "The Hangover 2." He detailed the plot and performances, specifically highlighting Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston (with numerous sexually explicit comments), Jason Bateman, Charlie Day (predicted for future movie stardom), an unusually unattractive Colin Farrell, and Donald Sutherland. Opie recounted a screening he attended with E-Rock and Roland, noting Roland's unusually focused viewing.

A caller, Mike from Vegas, offered Jim Norton a helicopter ride over the Hoover Dam. Another caller sparked a discussion about FX shows "Wilfred" and "Louie," leading to Opie sharing stories about photos with Elijah Wood, which were photobombed by E-Rock. The conversation then turned to Justin Bieber, including an incident with an off-duty NYPD officer and his fragrance "Someday." Opie described an attempt to get Bieber's attention, encountering enthusiastic fans in the process.  They briefly discussed the upcoming Bill Tetley Christmas special.

The show then played a voicemail compilation of profane messages directed at Bill Tetley.  The hosts further discussed the upcoming Bill Tetley Christmas special – a 40-minute stand-up interview with Cheap Trick (without instruments) filmed in an empty warehouse.  A phone call with Tetley himself followed, discussing the "Merry Tetley Christmas" jingle and his opinion of Whitey Bulger.  They then discussed a news story about a man hiding in a porta-potty tank at a yoga festival to evade police, offering crude commentary.  A lengthy call with Bobo ensued. Bobo was distraught about being excluded from "Couch of Zilches," crying on the air due to his perceived exclusion. The hosts teased him about his poor Mets game seats and goaded him into yelling at his mother over the phone about failing to submit an email for "Couch of Zilches."  The segment concluded with discussion of Bobo's potential future on "Couch of Zilches" and the scheduling difficulties due to his commitments and family (sister and dogs).

A "Chair of Honor" segment followed, initially involving a dispute over whether Bobo had refused the honor.  The hosts compared a fulfilled listener request to a scene from *Platoon*.  They discussed tweeting a photo of a host in the chair and then engaged in vulgar and sexually explicit conversation, including a detailed discussion about defecation and Avril Lavigne's bikini photos.  They discussed the upcoming appearance of Seth Gordon, director of *Horrible Bosses*, and introduced the "Couch of Zilches" segment, featuring studio audience members ("zilches").  Several "zilches" were interviewed about their jobs (hedge fund manager, novelty sales, technology project manager, legal software lawyer), personal lives, and tattoos.  One shared a story about a foul ball hitting the Phillie Phanatic; another discussed tattoos commemorating deceased parents.  Further discussion involved comparisons between Hispanic groups and a sexually suggestive anecdote about an uncle's behavior toward children. The "zilch" needing to use the restroom was voted into the Chair of Honor, receiving blueberries, a tissue, and iced tea.

A further "Chair of Honor" segment began by discussing the selection of the listener who needed to defecate. While waiting for Seth Gordon, the hosts engaged in banter, a sugary beverage presentation for Kenny, and another call with the upset Bobo.  A soundbite of Elijah Wood repeatedly saying "Yeah" was played.  Seth Gordon finally arrived, discussing "Horrible Bosses," its plot, actors (Jennifer Aniston, Charlie Day, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Ron White), comedic writing, deleted scenes with offensive language, and the pushback against edgy humor. He also discussed his previous work, "King of Kong," and Billy Mitchell, followed by a conversation about documentaries like "Hands on a Hard Body," "Catfish," and "Whites of West Virginia." The show concluded with promotion of "Horrible Bosses."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Hi, good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show for this Friday.  Hi.  June 24th.  Hi, all you people.  2011.  People out there, just out there listening.  Hi.  Hi to you. 
[00:01:00]  Hi yourself.  Live programming.  Yes.  On a Friday.  That's how we do it.  Oh, wow.  My God, man.  Yes.  Another swing around the loop of the week.  Here it is.  And then you know what happens?  What happens?  You get a couple of days, you hang around, you get together with friends, maybe familiar.  And then you start on shit Monday again. 
[00:01:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's how we operate.  It's called life.  It is called life.  There's a movie out that just spoke to my soul last night.  Spoke to your soul.  Literally spoke to my soul.  This movie, Horrible Bosses, I'm going to go on record and say that a lot of people are  going to be able to relate to.  Well, now, just the title alone leads me to believe.  This thing spoke to my free spirit, my soul, deep within my body. 
[00:02:00]  Is it an abstract title or is it kind of a literal title?  It is what it is, as people like to say.  I got to go on record and say, and you never know before these movies hit, I fucking loved  this movie.  Wow.  I love this movie more than Hangover 2, to give it a reference point.  It's one of the better comedies I've seen, if not the best comedy I've seen in a couple 
[00:02:30]  of years now.  Did you like Hangover 2?  I didn't mind it.  I didn't really, I didn't really, it was just there.  Okay.  It was there.  There was a few, there was a few good scenes, but they just redid the first movie in Thailand.  I mean, it's pretty much it.  But this Horrible Bosses, what do we have, the director coming in, Seth Gordon, who talked  before the film and he seemed like a really, really cool guy.  And Charlie Day from Always Sunny in Philadelphia. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And finally is going to be a movie star.  Oh yeah?  You're calling it?  Yes.  You're making the call?  Oh yeah.  And he's going to come in and do our show, because a lot of people were wondering after  I tweeted.  I don't know if he's going to be doing our show for this movie, because he's still filming  Always Sunny down there in Philly, but he's going to get in here soon.  And this fucking guy is going to be finally a movie star this Charlie Day.  Funny in every scene.  Funny in every scene.  Even scenes when he wasn't supposed to be funny. 
[00:03:30]  Really?  Yeah, he's the type of guy that, as soon as he pops on the screen at any moment, you  think it's going to just be hilarious.  He's just, it's effortless for this guy.  And what's the gist of this motion picture?  Oh, well, three guys who fucking hate their bosses.  Really?  Wow.  Yes.  That's interesting.  You want to ask more questions, Anthony?  I'm ready to answer some questions.  Wow.  About horrible bosses.  Three guys hate their bosses.  You got one boss who I could just, well, I'm not even going to say relate, that I really, 
[00:04:00]  really hate in this movie was a boss that just promises a lot of things.  Really?  And guess what?  It never happens.  I've got to see this movie.  Which drives Jason Bateman's character insane.  Really?  Yes.  I've got to see this.  And boy, Kevin Spacey playing that boss was just terrific.  Wow.  I could totally see that. 
[00:04:30]  Yes.  That's fantastic.  I almost wanted to, I almost thought I saw this logo on the side of the building.  He played a great, lousy boss in Swimming with Sharks.  Oh, yeah.  Kevin Spacey.  What a prick.  He's good in that role.  Kevin Spacey is the biggest prick in this movie.  And some of the things he says, a lot of people are going to be able to relate to.  Yeah?  The boss that is a bullshitter. 
[00:05:00]  They're going to resonate with people?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  There's three different bosses, too, man.  Really?  Yeah.  You've got kind of the corporate boss, which is the Kevin Spacey.  Then you've got the down and dirty, blue-collar type boss.  Yeah.  Who, well, I don't want to give away some spoilers, but I'll just say, that boss is played by Donald  Sutherland.  Donald Sutherland?  Yes.  There's a lot of cameos in this movie.  Wow.  And then the third boss is Jennifer Aniston as a dentist. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  So they're kind of like a bunch of professions are being represented.  Oh, okay.  So you can pick the boss that you can relate to.  What is that Colin Farrell picture?  That Colin Farrell is really almost unrecognizable in this movie.  He's got a stringy comb over in this movie.  And he sticks his belly out.  Because I guess, you know, the guy's in good shape.  Yeah.  I actually hung out with him, not a lot, but a little bit on my honeymoon. 
[00:06:00]  He happened to be at the same place I was at.  Oh, really?  And around the bar area, there was like five people every night.  And he was one of them.  Yeah.  He's a drinker.  So we had a little chit-chat.  Nothing too heavy.  But he seems like a really nice guy.  But he's in this movie with stringy comb over hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That comb over.  Look at him.  Uh-huh.  He looks awful.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think they've ever made anyone look uglier in a movie.  That's great.  Knowing what he looks like when he's just walking around normally. 
[00:06:30]  Damn, that is great.  Yeah.  In every scene, I think he was trying to stick out his belly to kind of look a little like  in shape, out of shape type of guy, which kind of worked with his character.  And he likes the whole karate kung fu thing.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  And you know, some of those guys could be douches.  I've got to see this.  And then Jennifer Aniston, I don't give a fuck how bad her pussy smells anymore.  This chick is so goddamn hot.  Really?  That I've got to think there's something wrong with Brad Pitt. 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  Now you're going that it was Brad Pitt's problem.  He has to have some kind of problem.  Or she maybe didn't want to have kids and he wanted to have kids.  Well, he wanted to have kids.  He just wanted to have, you know, assortment.  Look, Angelique Jolie is very sexy, yes.  But I'm team Jennifer all the fucking way.  Who knows who's a better bang, though?  Yeah.  Jennifer may be the eye contact, annoying kind of bang where she says, I love you.  And you're like, I don't know.  She's been playing some roles where she's showing off her body.  And I think she's 41, 42 years old. 
[00:07:30]  This body on Jennifer Aniston is ridiculous.  Yeah.  And you've got to see some of the outfits she wears in this fucking movie.  It's unbelievable.  And her character, she's the boss of Charlie Day, the guy from Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  He's kind of the dental assistant.  And the entire movie, Jennifer Aniston wants to have sex with Charlie Day.  But he has a fiance.  Okay.  So that's the storyline there.  I'm not giving anything away.  You see that immediately when this film starts.  And their scenes together are hilarious because Charlie doesn't want to bang Jennifer Aniston, 
[00:08:00]  the dentist, his boss.  She makes a fuckload of movies.  Yeah.  She really makes a lot of movies.  She never stopped working after Friends.  No.  You know?  My God.  I think Lisa Kudrow is way funnier.  But Jennifer Aniston has the look.  And she's funny in her own right.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  She's perfect for movies.  But the thing is, she makes all those dumb rom-coms.  Well, this isn't a rom-com, sir.  No, that's what I'm saying.  That's good. 
[00:08:30]  And the Adam Sandler movie was sort of rom-com.  Rom-com.  It was rom-com-ish, I guess.  Yeah.  And I know this is going to be a good movie because I went with E-Rock.  Oh.  And Roland.  Date night.  For E-Rock.  It was a free screening for everyone.  Yeah.  We were the ones that made it down there.  And it was the first movie I've been to with Roland.  And I've been to a bunch lately where he didn't fall asleep.  Wow.  So I think we're talking about a hit here.  That has to be massive.  And I finally said to myself, fuck it. 
[00:09:00]  If they throw me out, I've got to get video of him sleeping.  He didn't sleep at all.  He didn't sleep.  Not one snore.  Not one pissed off person because he's loudly snoring while people are trying to enjoy the movie.  But yeah, Horrible Bosses.  I liked it a lot.  Two thumbs up.  Two thumbs up.  How many people in the screening?  Almost packed.  If not packed.  Was it a laughing crowd? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They were laughing the whole way through.  That's good.  When you go see a comedy in a theater and people are laughing.  Yeah.  I liked it.  It kind of gets you into it a little more.  And a couple of the Wire guys are in it.  Oh.  Cuddy owns a bar.  I wish I knew when Cuddy was in here that he was going to be in this movie.  And Bunk.  Bunk plays a detective in this movie.  Bunk.  He plays Bunk, basically, in this movie.  So.  Sounds good. 
[00:10:00]  What is the?  No reviews yet?  What's the 85% part?  People who are wanting to see it.  That's it?  Yeah.  They should start having reviews now that a bunch of people saw the movie last night.  I guess they're writing them up today.  Oh, you guess.  One would assume.  Are they or are they not?  I don't know.  I've been watching too much trial.  Now just cross-examine everybody.  Everybody.  Let me say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, Opie, Anthony, Jimmy. 
[00:10:30]  Opie, I'm curious.  Pleasant.  How did Horrible Bosses compare to Office Space, which also featured Jennifer Aniston?  Jennifer Aniston, that is true.  I think, to be fair, Horrible Bosses is more of a mainstream movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Office Space is what it is.  I don't think you could compare the two, really.  Office Space is a little more underground, a little more indie-looking.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Honestly, that's how I would answer that question. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, Horrible Bosses mean definitely more for a mainstream audience.  And I don't mind a mainstream movie every once in a while.  As long as it's good.  Yeah.  There's definitely laughs in there.  We're going to go.  Let me say hi to Mike in Vegas.  Mike.  Hey, good morning.  In Vegas?  Hey, Mike!  The dancers will kick your tongue out?  That's for you to find out.  Draw a chip for everybody.  Everyone plays on the house.  I'm Mike in Vegas.  Mike, you don't call the Opie and Anthony show with bad jokes like that! 
[00:11:30]  I think I'm out of him.  Mike in Vegas?  We've never had that before.  We have not.  We'll be having that again.  really fast before Mike  I was just thinking about this  the only thing that didn't really make sense in this movie  was Charlie Day not wanting to fuck Jennifer Aniston  because she's so hot and sexy  but if he was engaged  you'll get guys that won't do that  absolutely that could be realistic  I know it's amazing 
[00:12:00]  but guys would be dedicated  to you know  and then regret it later in life  believe me  she's grabbing at his balls the whole movie  and you know the little water shooty thing  at the dentist's office  he's sitting there while there's a patient  passed out  and she just grabs it and starts squirting his crotch  to see what his cock looks like  and the language is pretty fucking salty  salty? is it a little blue?  and at one point Jennifer Aniston actually calls him  a faggot for not having sex with her 
[00:12:30]  and I went  and I'm wondering because these are  previews right now  I wonder if they're going to get a little scared  right before this is released July 8th  and take that line out  I wonder  who called the guy a faggot?  Jennifer Aniston called Charlie Day a faggot  for not having sex with her  that's why it's allowed  because Nick DiPaolo would go ballistic  right now with emasculating  I'm not saying it's not funny  but I mean that's why it's  I'm just surprised anyone is allowed  I'm surprised anyone is allowed  to say that  with the climate in Hollywood 
[00:13:00]  you know  oh good  good for them  yeah absolutely  go ahead Mike  alrighty  Jimmy I'm calling for you  my girlfriend and I  went out to see you in Hollywood  a couple years ago  when you were at the Viper Room  and we went to see you  a couple months ago  when you were here in Vegas  you're welcome twice  yes  thank you indeed  but anyway  we got tickets to your show  here in Vegas  and when you come out here  I wanted to tell you  I'm a helicopter pilot  here in Vegas  there's a guy from yesterday  I'm one of the news organizations  and I've got access to a helicopter

[00:14:00]  if you want  we can do the strip  and I'm also a flight instructor too  so we can make it a  you know I can let you  take the controls  and actually try out  flying the thing a little bit  if you want to  I'd be afraid  that I would just do  the one wrong thing  that is unrecoverable  I've got over 600 hours  of instruction  and believe me  I've been put into  all kinds of  precarious situations  got not every one of them  and believe me  I'm not just going to  throw you the whole thing  and say here  take it  you know fly it  it's just going to be  a little bit at a time  and it makes it  a lot more interesting  let Jimmy auto rotate  let Jimmy auto rotate 
[00:14:30]  it down  what's that mean  that's when you lose power  oh I don't want to do it  yeah like Jack Warden  in uh  in injustice for all  oh no  we're not going to  make it back  maybe  maybe not  hey thanks man  that'd be fun  but make sure Eric  gets your number  sounds good  thanks brother  alright hold on there Mikey  appreciate it  thanks guys  I want to see Hoover Dam  I've never seen Hoover Dam  every time I'm in Vegas  it's like  it's just a ride  it's a little ride  over there  couple hours maybe 
[00:15:00]  sure  I may actually  I got invited  to the premiere of that  too I didn't go  I think  of this  of Horrible Bosses  I believe so  yeah man I liked it  probably should have went  but I just was working  I fucking liked it man  I get a little scared  whenever  I see Jennifer Aniston  in something  I instantly think  a rom-com  that's uh you know  that's not a good thing  no this is more edgy  finally  finally  thank god  oh yeah Jamie Foxx 
[00:15:30]  is in there  and you know what  the movie  he's not even close  to the funniest guy  in this movie  not even close  we're watching the preview  in the background here  uh let's say hi  to Garth in Indiana  Garth  good morning fellas  hello Garth  hey uh while I cannot  offer you a helicopter ride  I gotta say  I gotta switch gears  and say that uh  last night between  Wilfred and Louie  best hour of fucking TV  I've ever watched  oh well you liked it  good good  yeah I got a lot of  good tweets about Wilfred  yeah so did I

[00:17:00]  in the background  that kind of  wrecked it  ah  shit  it's not that good  I could photoshop  it out and put  an O&A logo  behind it  it would be great  yeah  very average  to below average  I'm just gonna  cut both of us out  and put us on  a Caribbean beach  that's what I should do  my picture with Elijah Wood  looks like we're both singing  yeah I saw that one  and it does look like  you're singing  yeah so I tweeted that  were you just talking  to each other  or going like  oh  I said we were singing  Justin Bieber baby  yeah  and then uh  that was preceded by 
[00:17:30]  oh I don't know  maybe a hundred tweets  call me a faggot  and a queer  oh okay  and uh  what else  a bear and a twink singing  it does look like  you're singing together  the fact is  if you want to know  the truth  I just got photobombed  by E-Rock  and went  oh you got me  and Elijah Wood  thought it was pretty funny  but I mean  if you look at the shot  it looks like  we're just singing  E-Rock just has to  take one step  in the room  and he's photobombing  get it  because he's so big  he gotta go  with him  because his hand

[00:19:30]  a bunch of guys  that have some shit  they gotta take care of  sort of an ensemble  cast  and they're running  all over the place  trying to figure shit out  shit going on  shenanigans  chicanery  I think cause of  Hangover  and Hangover 2  we're gonna have a bunch  of movies like that  a bunch of those  are gonna come out  a few guys  that have to run around  a lot and get things  done  get things done  and fall into  some weird situations  that's right  but definitely  on an edge  Jennifer Aniston  thumbs up  very hot  I'm telling you man  in the Adam Sandler movie 
[00:20:00]  when she stripped  out of that bikini  and jumped in that  dumb water  that's when I was like  what is going on  with this girl  she's 41  42 years old  the scene where  she's just wearing  the lab coat  is amazing  oh wow  and what is it  like flapping open  a little bit  oh yeah  well she calls  Charlie Day  into her office  and as soon as  Charlie Day  comes in  she has a buzzer  that locks him in  and she's looking  out the window  and all you see  is her like  dentist-y lab coat  oh I gotcha  and she turns around 
[00:20:30]  and you're  pretty much  looking at her tits  wow  pretty much  looking at them  what is  I wonder what she does  some kind of  what's her regimen  I'm sure  she must work at it  nah I'm sure  she's one of those  genetics  she eats like a bird  yeah  I'm sure she just  eats like a bird  suffers through  the whole fucking thing  she used to be  a little fatty  when she was a kid  a little fatty  that's from a few years ago  the GQ cover  anyway  maybe it is

[00:23:30]  and then  yeah  yeah  and I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan  and now movie posters  are like  I'm falling into this movie poster thing  and I gotta blame Danny a little bit  he was the one that kind of started this thing  cause he  he emails me  these movie posters  that I know he wants to see  and he knows  and he knows I kind of have the resources  so I see him  and I'm just like  fuck  I just got the alien one  delivered yesterday  it's an original  1979  alien 
[00:24:00]  movie poster  what kind of shape  and it's fucking  it's in  it's like  it's the one right below  pristine  you could tell  it had been folded  at some point  but they worked  the fold out  they put it on a  a um  a linen backing  they put on it  it's like a painting  and I'm putting in nice big frames  I'm getting them all framed  and I  he showed me one yesterday now  this fucking Jaws one  really  original  rolled 
[00:24:30]  no fucking folds  unused  at the theater  just an original  rolled  Jaws  fucking movie poster  this guy Jerry I know  has been emailing me  he's the one that gets everything  he got me a Midnight Cowboy  signed by Voight and Hoffman  he has a  John Voight  he has an Aliens poster  or an Alien poster for you  signed by uh  no he doesn't  I'll show you the email  signed by  James Cameron  what does he have to do with Alien  uh Aliens  the second one  maybe that's what it is  signed by James Cameron  I got no problem with that either  yeah  believe me 
[00:25:00]  and there's one  and he's gonna get some other people on it  oh this is great  Aliens signed by Cameron  that's amazing  that's huge  that is huge  huge  and you know  I was listening to the back  it's not that  that I want to see these things  it's that  you have a theater  that is nice  with no decoration  I know  with zero  and it's just  it's time that you do something about that  well the theater itself  inside is decorated  in art deco fashion  but  but all along the outside  you need theatery things  well I need theatery things  theatery things  mean movie posters 
[00:25:30]  so I  I got a few in mind  that I really want to get  and uh  hang those up  I mean real classic ones  and then uh  and then we were laughing  to get like a light box one  that they use  at movie theaters now  and then get an assortment  of ones that are cheap  and just put up like  shitty movie ones  like all those stupid  hey with the girl  oh  that'd be funny  Matthew McConaughey  movie posters  oh god  she's at it again  oh look at him  he's  he's trying  he's a  flandering  but uh 
[00:26:00]  I'm so psyched  to get this uh  get this shit up there  and done  I think Andrew's uh  getting the framing done  and uh  yeah  I'll have that theater  fucking movie posters  just cranking  I'm looking for  Close Encounters  that's the one I want too  Close Encounters  all original people  don't give me reproductions  Close Encounters  Close Encounters  word is out  I like that one  that's the one with a  the kids opening the door  and you see  no Uncle Paul  and you see like  kind of a silhouette  through that red  fucking light 
[00:26:30]  coming through the door  Close Encounters  nice  how many movie posters  can you put down there  I counted  I can put about  seven down there  yeah I can put about  seven  so those are three  seven  Alien Jaws  so you gotta be very selective  yeah  posters  yeah  oh look  yeah  well that's a  that's the day bill  yeah yeah  it's kind of like that  because I know  what you're talking about  but I think  what you're thinking of  is just a still  from the movie  that might be a still  and it's not actually  a poster  it's the ship  and uh  the original poster  is the ship  and Devil's Tower 
[00:27:00]  exactly  there's a couple of them  I think the main one  is just like the road  you know where  oh right right  with the light  coming out  that's great  look at that  that is a great poster  but what you're talking about  is just  it's just a scene  from the  that was never  an original poster  wow I thought that  well oh you know  it might have been  a DVD  um  shit too  yeah could be  I put it on the DVD  oh well  well I'm  I'm looking anyway  fuck me running  uh you'll  you'll absolutely  you should try to get one  for the new Arthur  oh the new Arthur  yes that I want  that's good for the light box 
[00:27:30]  yeah  yeah another one  just only shitty movies  go in there  new Arthur  Jesus  oh um  please  and Roland  was the only one yesterday  that had an empty seat  two empty seats  to his right  two empty seats  to his right  he takes the whole  this seat has taken  to the highest level possible  like to just get more room  for yourself  well I can see them  people are coming  they go  ah there's two seats  and I wait  so they're all excited  running out there 
[00:28:00]  but I'm sorry  he's out getting the food  the lights go down  and two people come  like  the movie's about to start  and he still pulled it off  wow  and then quickly  jumped on his phone  because they're looking at him  like obviously  these seats aren't taken  so he picks up his phone  really fast  and goes  hey man where are you  the movie's about to start  clever  clever man  so these two seats  stayed empty  the entire movie  and then like  the last couple  that you know  were trying to get the seats  had to like  split up  because he didn't want 
[00:28:30]  to get the seats  he's such a dick  I understand  doing that a little bit  oh that's great  right until the  opening credits  good  it gives you a buffer zone  yeah I could put  a popcorn there  yeah yeah  Roland you didn't fall asleep  first movie I've gone to  with you where you  didn't fall asleep  I loved it though  that's why  yeah that's what I said  I think that's why  it's going to be good  horrible bosses  yeah right on  when is that out  two weeks from today  July 8th  and now Roland  what do you have there 
[00:29:00]  the next two episodes  of Breaking Bad  from the fourth season  for me  yeah because you're  the only one caught up  I am totally caught up  I want to see what it looks  like in a second  you can throw it  I'm ahead of everybody  there's only two episodes here  oh that's cool  the first three  he saw the first one  I saw the first one  that's cool  of the new season  and these are the next two  I couldn't be happy  that's cool  that's fantastic  that's awesome  I have to try to get  into that show  right  I was completely  engrossed 
[00:29:30]  so uh  I'm all caught up  look at this  oh  I could have this signed  yeah  when we get some people  coming in  yeah maybe you could do that  and get a little  brief case for it  yes  JJ from New Hampshire  how are you brother  this is great  good morning gentlemen  I want to know  what JJ is doing  this weekend  because you call  the show a lot  what does  what does a JJ  do on the weekends  JJ sits at home 
[00:30:00]  and dreams of  having more money  so he can do  other things  oh poor JJ  JJ should brush his teeth  with a shotgun  I remember those days  wishing for that  hey I just wanted  to comment on FX  last night  that was the best  hour of TV  I've seen  in a long time  FX is really  stepping up  Louis was fantastic  I mean it was  a half hour build up  to a fart joke  and I laughed  my balls off  and then 
[00:30:30]  I couldn't believe  the ass eating  the stand up  at the end  where he just  talked about  ass eating  on TV  it is amazing  and I loved it  FX is really  stepping up man  they're putting on  the best television  right now  you can't  no debate about it  I think FX  has balls  you know  they're showing  their balls  they're saying  look  there is an audience  for some edgy shit  and we're gonna  do just that  FX has a million  good shows now  it amazes me  why the networks  can't see that  they can't look  and go  wow we're losing 
[00:31:00]  viewers to this  oh but it's awful  no one wants  to see that  it's a  no people want  to see real shit  they want to  hear real language  candy coated  crap  on network  television  and they can't  compete because  of the FCC  that's one thing  the networks  can't get around  they could never  do half the things  they do on the shows  but just like radio  they stop way  before regulations  yeah yeah  they should fight back  with their network TV  with politically correct  stuff they stop with 
[00:31:30]  which isn't FCC  right  it's not an FCC issue  dummies  alright JJ  I'm glad  and you liked  Wilfred?  oh Wilfred was great  it was just bizarre  but it had that  awkwardness  that  it was almost like  the beginning of  Louis  the first season  it was just that  awkwardness at the  beginning  that you can just see  it's building up  into something  a lot better  and I'm actually  excited for it  and I think  it's really turning 
[00:32:00]  into a stand-ups  network  you know  people that have  a sense of humor  want to watch  what's on there  as opposed to  the you know  milquetoast  network nonsense  people that don't  get it  don't go elsewhere  good for you JJ  have a good weekend  alright  you too buddy  thank you a lot  alright  let's say hi  to Joe in Tennessee  Joe  hey what's up boys  what's up  hey  I gotta say  first of all  man  your photo  your Uncle Fester  photobomb  was the best  dude  and uh  Jimmy  you should be 
[00:32:30]  on there  with uh  Brooke Shields  and that  oh the uh  Jimmy poking  through your  Brooke Shields  picture  yeah  but uh  my real question  is for Anthony  I was just  making sure  everything went  right at the  doctor yesterday  oh yes  two fingers  and a knuckle  or one  no no  no no  no fingers  you didn't get  any fingers  no fingers  I got a  clean bill  of health  I'm not  knocking wood  because uh  you know  you never want  to take that  for granted  because you know  without your health

[00:35:00]  that's  it's a vagina  opening rose petals  which represents  a vagina  so he's like  someday I'll get  some pussy  and that's  to try to hold  on to his  young fans  because once he  slips his dick  in some chick  all those young  girls are gonna  go  eeeew  eeeew  and run away  are you sure  that's  yeah they will  are you sure  the top of  someday is a  young vagina  or is that a  pink sock  it does look like  a fucking  prolapsed asshole

[00:36:30]  know he  was a uh  he's a cop  and he saw  a barricade  come down  so he knew  like if the  barricade's down  there's gonna be  this influx of  young chippies  that would you  know overrun  the Biebs  and uh he  went to go get  in the in the  way and he  was uh uh  off duty and  out of uniform  and the security  guards for  Justin Bieber  just thought he  was some guy  and ran at  him  yeah  listen to that  oh my god 
[00:37:00]  oh my god  it's like  Cloverfield  holy shit  look at how  many people  are there  oh no  it's like the  start of the  anti-social comedy  tour  yes  it's a girl  screaming  holy shit  that's a lot  of fucking  people  screaming  listen to  that sound  ugh  look oh  he's coming  Adam  gosh gosh  gosh gosh  oh gosh gosh  young pussy  juice  gosh gosh

[00:38:30]  keeping  your fingers  go like  how far  down would  you push  them  you know  just the  top of  the waistband  yeah  so you  could feel  like what  the small  of the  back  or something  sure  the front  oh the  front  you put  the cd  in there  don't  fall  out  oh okay  that makes  sense  i thought  you were  putting it  in where  their  i wanted  to meet  him  see  justin  bieber  why  he's  wonderful  little  solid  head of  hair  but he

[00:42:30]  smoking in  line  just girls  turning around  as a creepy  guy smoking  yelling for  the Biebs  I kept  saying  do you  got a  light  you got  a light  Justin  now they're  all trying to  move away  from you  but the  crowd is  I kept  trying to  get the  girls to  sing  mbop  no  that's  handsome  yeah  feels like  he's singing  to you  don't it  it really  does  sure  this is  baby baby 
[00:43:00]  this stupid  song is  catchy  oh  yeah  I misunderstood  what it was  about  oh you  did  sure  baby baby  oh  thought it  was a  coming of  age  story  is this  his only  song  really  nah  he's got  some hits  but I mean  it's a  it's a  whopper  of a big  song  I'm dancing  this has the  most views  on YouTube  right  it's gotta  be 
[00:43:30]  it's gotta  be  what's this  got  it's probably  got like  300,000  views  what a  weak voice  like it  just has a  weak sounding  voice  it's airy  and  and  high  falsetto  we  no balls  to it  little auto  tuning  little auto  tuning  all right  we should  take a  break  here  I was  enjoying  that  why'd you  turn that 
[00:44:00]  off  I was  bopping  around  we don't  want to  lose  every  listener  our  listeners  love this  this  translates  well  oh yeah  that's  right  in our  demo  oh I  thought he  was saying  maybe  maybe  got my  hopes up  beep  yelling  for the  beep  they kept  telling me  to put  my  ciggies  out  a lot  of young  girls got  some second  hand smoke  yeah  going home  smelling like  cigarette smoke  I was talking  close to their  faces they kept  pulling back 
[00:44:30]  yeah  I kept  saying when  do you think  the  beams will  be here  they'll do  that  when do  you think  the  the  beams  video  this video  has  571  million  it's got  a half  a billion  hits  I'm gonna tell you  something  views  you don't  it's hard to go  away for a guy  like this  because  fame is different  now than it was  it's ingrained  and all accessible  so more people  are famous  Leif Garrett 
[00:45:00]  never had a  half a billion  views  on a video  he did  can I ask you  something about that  so this video  has a half  billion views  why isn't MTV  doing  music videos  obviously all  the kids  are going  to YouTube  and watching  these videos  why would you  sit and wait  for that video  to come up  when you  could just  go to YouTube  and fucking  pop it  oh you think  that's what  the problem  is  it's instant  gratification  now  what if you  have 10  I don't know  maybe just  20 videos  that you  just roll  through  it's not a  bad idea 
[00:45:30]  well  I don't know  I think they  would get an  audience  I think  because  the demo  they're going  for is so  computer savvy  they just go  oh I want to  see this  Justin Bieber  baby song  and bam  it's right on  he's a good  dancer this guy  571 million views  what's he doing  in the bowling alley  these cheesy  fucking  pseudo Michael  Jackson moves  he is really  a horrid  dancer  what rapper's  in this  Luda  oh Luda Chris  that's Luda Chris  wow  and some

[00:46:30]  well Usher  discovered him  so I guess  yeah  so Usher gets  a piece of  all that right  I'm imagining  Usher was the  first one to see  that rosebud  pop out  and what a  fucking  what a train  Usher jumped on  by discovering  it's like who  is it  I think Lady Gaga  was on M&M's  was she on  Interscope  and Akon  no Akon  discovered  Lady Gaga  how did he  find Lady Gaga  she was a  songwriter for  him  really  yeah she was  a songwriter  on his label 
[00:47:00]  wow  so he gets  a piece of  her and  maybe not  yeah he said  she retired  him  like that's  why he doesn't  really put  records out  anymore  because he  just makes  Lady Gaga  money now  who's Akon  Akon  he was popular  for a little  while  no he wasn't  like Lady Gaga  popular  he had a good  song called  what was the  song called  it's an  apology song  because he got  in trouble  for some  but it's good  really  some Verizon  chick  there was an  underage girl  in a club  and Verizon  dropped him  from an 
[00:47:30]  endorsement  deal  oh my god  what's this  called  Akon  looks more  like  K-Con  hey uh  we discovered  Sam  which  yes  which might  get us a  dinner someday  isn't it amazing  we might get a  dinner out of it  the levels of  discovery you can  have and what we  stumbled on  which is shite  and a hat  I'm sorry  I might get  I might get a  free dinner at  Applebee's one  day  for helping  discover Sam  not yet  yuck 
[00:48:00]  why couldn't we  be discovering  Justin Bieber  instead of this  client  they're making  millions  and we can get  a song played  on hits one  at 3am  god did we  step in shit  and I mean that  literally  not metaphorically  how did this  guy discover  Lady Gaga  and he's left  in the wake  no he's not  though  he's just making  money now  he gets a piece  of the action  he's well known  I mean to this  day her albums  are on whatever  slash convict  music  all convict  music  K-O-N  A-Con

[00:58:30]  really bad  breath  really yeah  that's what  the word is  on the street  right isn't  that in the  headline today  word on the  street  yeah  yeah guys  said he had  bad breath  at all  just to embarrass  him  B  I  O  and  Y  oh god  Bill Tetley  one story of the  day  what is story of the  day  well  feces stained  man 
[00:59:00]  that's good enough  right there  sure  we have another  one of these guys  he hid in a  portable toilet tank  oh  and he escaped  chase  this creep  Boulder police  out there in  Denver  are looking for  a man who hid  in the tank  of a portable  toilet  at a yoga  festival  before running  off  because guys  and girls are  shitting in that  right  I like a good  yoga  I bet a yoga  girl would take  a good long  tapered shit 
[00:59:30]  yeah it's been  worked up like  clay  oh yeah  they don't have  runny shits  no  nice yoga shit  so if you're  going to hide  in a porta potty  at a yoga  festival  that makes sense  because you  could dodge  those logs  yeah yeah  it's not going  to be spraying  down at you  dodge the logs  what kind of  fucking  perv switch  is this about  when you need  to crawl into  a fucking  toilet  to look up  and see  what  vag  little s  who goes  to a fucking  yoga festival  yeah  never heard of 
[01:00:00]  one  a woman  at the  dirty  stinky  hippies  yeah  boo  yeah  a woman  at the  Hanuman  festival  went into  the portable  toilet  friday  and noticed  something  moving in  the tank  when she  lifted the  lid  wow  the woman  exited  and asked  the man  nearby  to look  inside  the tank  that is  a computer  generated  image  of what  the guy  looks like  he's kind  of in  the tank  he's in  the tank  and he's 
[01:00:30]  he's kind  of to the  side  his body  but his  face  is directly  under  the seat  I guess  he hides  right  he pulls  himself over  all the way  to the side  she sits  down  and then he  peeks his  head over  so he could  look up at her  vagina and see  her shit  falling onto  his face  but the thing  isn't there  water in those  things  yeah there's  like a blue  kind of a  liquid  but it's not  full  yeah it depends  on it  so he was just  kind of floating  in there  like a sensory 
[01:01:00]  deprivation tank  with shit  he's a big  Rogan fan  yes  I thought  it was more  like an  outhouse  where your  log drops  about six  feet  it's like  a port-a-potty  no this is  a port-a-potty  yeah it's  much different  I mean  what they're  showing us  here is  his face  is right  there  when you  open the  lid  you'll see  his entire  face  I think  he was  hiding  while they  open the  lid  and then he  slides over  to look at  the goodness  yeah yeah  the goodness  of the shit 
[01:01:30]  just falling  on his face  could you imagine  how excited  he gets  when he's  looking  no one's  on to him  and he sees  the asshole  going  and then it  just opens  up  and it's like  oh here it  comes falling  on my face  but especially  when he sees  when he sees  the asshole  opening  and he sees  it it's almost  birthing a snake  and he goes  oh it's going  to be a long  big boy  because he  probably hates  when he hears  like 
[01:02:00]  he probably  moved his head  out of the way  so he doesn't  get squirted  I smelled  a few ripe  shites in there  the woman  exited  asked the man  nearby  to look inside  the tank  the man  told police  he saw  something  moving under  a tarp  and when  he left  the toilet  he heard  it locked  from the inside  oh wow  a security  survivor  then  supervisor  then waited  outside for  the person  to emerge  so what  he climbed  out of the  tank  he climbed  out  yeah  when he did 
[01:02:30]  the supervisor  tried to get him  to sit down  but he ran  off covered in feces  covered in feces  this guy's  between 6 foot 5  to 6 foot 8  wow  holy shit  how'd he get in there  wow 6 foot 8  uh oh  hi  I was at the  yoga festival  looking at duty  yeah that's  that's desperate  they're not sure  how he was able  to squeeze into 
[01:03:00]  the tank  or what he was  doing there  we all know  what he was doing  there  covered in shit  that's his thing  man  wow that's  disgusting  I think we have  an update  people are saying  they caught the guy  we don't care  if they caught the guy  we just think  it's hilarious  this hilarious  doesn't affect us  it's way over there  good he's gone  bug him  goodbye  good ridden  stinky  man  why is Bobo calling  well  he uh 
[01:03:30]  oh god  what fucking  all I've heard  is the tragedy  of Bobo  his phone calls  have been  uh  just  heart wrenching  about what  he's getting pissed off  at the guys in the office  he feels like  he's not being included  like he used to  because  he wasn't asked  to be a part  of Couch of Zilches  yes  we'll explain  Couch of Zilches  in a moment  but uh  Bobo wasn't asked  to be part of it  right  he had the same  opportunity that  everybody else did  when we put the  Facebook message up  yesterday  yeah  but he wasn't  specifically asked 
[01:04:00]  so he didn't have  time to get his  entry in on time  so obviously  he's not going to  be here for it  um  and he insists  that uh  specifically  Danny and Travis  are purposely  forbidding him  from getting to  Opie  because he has  a Mets ticket  for Opie  that he is sure  Opie will accept  and go to the  Mets game  with him  right  where are  the seats  that I don't know  we haven't checked  the seating trick  you're going to go  to a ball game  with the Bobo  you really should  I used to take  Brewers tickets  every once in a while 
[01:04:30]  but he had good seats  and it wasn't Bobo  one ticket  you and Bobo would go  yeah you'd go with Bobo  it's not like he's  selling you tickets  he has a ticket for you  but he and you  would go together  like pals  which would be accurate  like pals  I think you should do it  did he start crying  on the phone yesterday  yes he did  he was crying  because he wasn't  being invited in  well he wanted to know  quote  to Danny and Travis 
[01:05:00]  why did you guys  become assholes  was the quote  why did you guys  become assholes  and then  I guess  we didn't cater  this contest to him  he brought up  his stand up  to Danny  brought up like  his stand up  and Danny just goes  you know  Bobo  you're not going to  be a stand up  well I disagree  with that  I think  and Bobo  then turned into  angry Bobo  and said  you don't believe  in me  Danny's not a 
[01:05:30]  supportive guy  on the phone  sometimes  with Bobo  Danny why are you  more supportive  to Bobo  he was crying  and he said  you don't believe  in me  I was wondering  because Bobo  puts a lot of  time and effort  into his stand up  career  and I was just  curious as to  why he has so  much passion for  that but he  doesn't have  that time and  energy to put  into something  like oh I  don't know  getting some  kind of  pseudo job  to pay for  things around  the house  and stuff  he's perfectly  capable of  sweeping a floor 
[01:06:00]  at McDonald's  of course  I've seen  plenty of them  and I'm like  Bobo  you're not  going to be  a stand up  and that's  when he kind  of lost his  mind  he starts  crying  oh Bobo  let's talk  to him  should we  talk to him  but why do  I attract  the weirdos  why does  he want  to take  me  you're a  fun guy  you're the  Mets fan  and you  are open  I haven't  been to  Shea Stadium  in five 
[01:06:30]  years  probably  or City  Field  whatever  I haven't  been to  the new  City Field  that's been  open a couple  seasons now  right  Danny and I  have discussed  Danny's a huge  Mets fan  oh that is  true  so Danny  goes  yeah I think  that would be  fun to go to  a Mets game  with Bobo  me and Travis  would absolutely  go to a Mets  game with Bobo  let me say  hi to Bobo  Bobo  yeah hi  hi guys  oh what's the  Maddie  this is down  Bobo  why are you  called  first of all  why don't we  start there 
[01:07:00]  I didn't even  say I'm  going yet  when's the  game Bobo  it's the  16th of  July  is that a  weekend  yes it is  it's on a  Saturday  oh fuck  weekends are  tough  yeah no  weekend would be  good for you  you'd be off  you and Bobo  can make a night  of it  I got a kid  we've got  parties every  weekend  nah but you know  what you go to  the game  you and Bobo  go out to eat  afterwards you have  plenty of time  where are the  seats  the next seats  right there  they're average 
[01:07:30]  at best  average at best  you're really  selling this  thing  I don't mean to  laugh but I  want to see what  average at best is  in Bobo's mind  what's the number  what would you say  average at best is  for city field  Danny  you've been to  enough games  not city field  though I've only  been to like  actually  but in general  at a baseball game  average at best  would be about  where  I don't know  maybe like  sort of down the  first baseline  first or third  baseline  the loge  but you're past 
[01:08:00]  the base  past the base  just a little bit  that's average at best  yeah that's average  and how high up  you think  yeah I would say  I would say  well what used to  be called the loge  I don't know  what they call it  now look at city  field and give me  a section about  where average at  best would be  in the orange  section  I would say  orange yeah  let's call it  the 300s there  the 300s is  two levels above  average at best  and somewhere down  the first baseline  past the base  that's average at best  alright Bobo  what's your seats  the reason they 
[01:08:30]  call them average  seats is because  they're up in the  500s  alright let's  let's see where  that is  see I knew  this would work  out perfect  oh my god  I knew this would  work out  look at where  they are  you see where  the stadium  stops going up  you're gonna have  to duck when  the planes go by  Bobo  LaGuardia is great  at that point  you can write  your initials on  the bottom of the  planes when they  fly over  alright I'm still in  they go too fast  oh literal  chip  I'm still in  it's the highest  section possible  yeah  and  I'll read you 
[01:09:00]  the seat  where it is  okay what's the  number  alright  I'm reading this  off of my ticket  it's a  hold on  hold on  don't say it  don't say it  don't say it  wait wait wait  I'm gonna predict  it could possibly  be the worst  seat you can get  I'm going with  either  hold on  don't say anything  no matter what  we say yet  okay  it's gonna be  way in the  fucking corner  it's gonna be  501-502-503  it's either  501-502-503  or 538-537-536  put those down  Bobo  Bobo  yeah  what is it 
[01:09:30]  what is the ticket  number  it's a  526  a 526  okay  it's not  it's not  way out there  but it is  you're in foul  territory  it's yeah  526 is equal  to  first of all  about  mid outfield  no man  it's the corner  it's the corner  yeah  it's the  it's the  the foul pole  it's the corner  but you're so  far  I would have to  tilt all the way  to the right  to see anything  and you're so 
[01:10:00]  high up  526  where'd you get  these tickets  I just won  these in a  bar contest  don't they just  give away these  wait how did  you win a  bar contest  no it was  a trivia  question  I wanted  what was the  trivia question  oh no  the trivia  question was  who was  the starting  pitcher for  game 7  of the 86  world series  Bob O'Hita  uh  Franco  Steve 
[01:10:30]  Apodaca  no it was  Ron  Rod  Rod  Rod  Darling  oh  hey um  wow  so you  knew that  and you  won the  tickets  you realize  we're gonna  have to sit  with the  Puerto Ricans  right  what horrid  place  what horrid  place is  giving out  these shitty  tickets  oh my god  that's awful  you know  I gotta go  now  you gotta go  but who  are they  playing  wait what 
[01:11:00]  row are  they  what row  it's a  row 14  you're in  the middle  of shit  that's the  worst bar  contest  horrid  bar  how many  rows  how many  rows in  section 5  26  is there  any way  to find  that out  who did  you say  was  between 20  and 30  Bobo what  was the  trivia question  again  it was  who was  the starting  pitcher  for game  7  of the  1986  oh  I answered  game 6  you said  game 6  before 
[01:11:30]  I said  game 7  it sounded  like  it was  Bob Yojita  yeah  oh fuck  Bobo  fucking oil  can nigga  are you gonna  go with Bobo  because Bobo  was really upset  when I said  that you probably  would not be  going with him  because that's  kind of when  angry  not angry  Bobo  but like  really  really upset  Bobo  came out  and really  upset  Bobo  said  I just  want to  go to  a game  with one  of my  heroes  did you 
[01:12:00]  say that  Bobo  yeah  I did  yeah  I did  okay  so what's  the matter  Bobo  do you feel  Danny's not  being supportive  of you  fucking  creep magnet  always  it's always  me  fuck  July 16th  oh you already  invited  L.P  damn it  why  what's  July 16th  what's going on  cool Saturday  I've never  been to  the city  field  oh that  would be  nice  Bobo  maybe  Jimmy  will  go  with  you  would  you  want  to  go  with  Jimmy  Norton  yeah 
[01:12:30]  I'll  take  that  nah  what about  me  I don't like  being I'll take  that guy  I'll take that  it depends first  does Opie want to go  nah I can't be second  yeah I can't be second  banana thanks for nothing  you just threw Opie  he was one of your heroes  and then you just basically threw him in the garbage  and then threw Jim in the garbage  as being second fiddle  yeah like well if Opie's not busy  maybe Jim Norton will do  suffice  and who are they playing that day  they're playing against Philly that day  oh wow  that ain't bad 
[01:13:00]  that ain't bad  do we know who's pitching yet  probably not right  no that's too early to know  Ron Darlig  Bobo can you  can you give both the tickets to Opie  so you can go with his family  if I do that  I'd give out my ticket  yeah  but that's  that's true sacrifice  no getting it past you there  how many games do you go to a year Bobo  depends what I get tickets to  roughly  on average  depends how many 
[01:13:30]  how many did you last year  oh last year  I think I went to  five games last year  do you watch most of them  yeah  no  I know you wear glasses  but can you even see the field from that far  yeah  yeah you could  actually these seats  are more like  the  more like the green seats  which were below  red seats  which were the highest up seats  you're 14 rows back  in the upper deck  yeah what are you talking about  they're terrible tickets  Bobo  walk me through this 
[01:14:00]  we can't spend too much time  but walk me through this  do I have to pick you up  what goes down  oh right  transportation  do I have to buy the hot dogs  the beers  what am I doing  come on how's it work  walk me through this  fast  you don't have to do anything  all you need to do is just  just show up  alright  alright  if anything  maybe I'll buy you  a Shake Shack Burger  a Shake Shack Burger  I like Shake Shack Burger  what's a Shake Shack Burger  Bobo  I would love one  we got a Shake Shack  in our neighborhood  Jimmy  you should go  I don't know what that is  good burgers  I'm trying to watch my tummy 
[01:14:30]  and you get a little milkshake  with it  ooh  a Shake Shack Burger  they're good  sounds delicious  you don't have to wait  on the line  because I'll go get it  for you  yeah the lines are long  for the Shake Shack Burgers  yeah if you  anybody who's gone  to Medscape  can tell you  that place  that place generates  some of the longest lines  out of any of the food stores  let's hear about the lines  slowly though  wait it's my first experience  at Citi Field  it's going to be  in section 526  in the fucking clouds 
[01:15:00]  sitting by myself  because he's going to be  online for an hour  to get me a Shake Shack Burger  getting a sunburn  from the stadium lighting  Bobo what about  cold beverages  yeah  oh yeah  can you afford  the cold beverages too  some beers  that's the fucking view  from that seat  that's the seat view  that's the seat view  that's not bad  well they  I think they really take  like a nice zoomed in picture  they really do  they're taking liberties  with that shot  stop with it  it's not that bad  because  you see  there's like one row  of people in front of you

[01:44:30]  kick another  person out  to get you  in there  yeah  all right  so i guess  i'll just  have to be  next to  the what  they go  the back  of the line  yeah  yeah  back in a  line  kind of like  the met  seats  yep  yep  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  and how  the heck  am i  supposed to  get this  language  to begin  with  we don't  know  all i know  is you  you know  you should  have told  danny  you wanted  to do  it  right

[01:45:30]  the couch  is zilches  we can't  tell other  people that  are traveling  from around  the country  that they  can't have  a seat  on the  couch  so that's  gonna be  tough as  well  even though  i'm bothered  you passed  up the  seat of  honor  right  and i think  my niece's  birthday is  on the 16th  but maybe  she would  understand  sure  so we'll  see  all right  all right  i'll sign up  maybe the couch  of honor  hopefully you'll  get booked  the next  in line  well there's  no reason  again it's  booked until  december  and if you  don't want  to be on  the honor  throne  that's up  to you 
[01:46:00]  no i want  to and if  i have to  wait that  long damn  it i'll wait  that long  well we might  discontinue it  so uh whatever  then you'll never  be on the show  yeah then there'll  be no shot  of you getting  on  all right  i want  i want  i want  it  we wanted  this all right  well you know  you should have  told danny  they didn't tell  me soon  soon enough  all right  well tell  danny  just whatever  you want  what message  should we give  danny  i don't i 
[01:46:30]  don't know what  you could give  because there's  not much that  could help me  get this sooner  to you what  do you want  to get  i don't know  that that  that couch  of honor  the chair  of honor  it's the couch  of zilches  and the chair  of honor  and the chair  of honor  is it going  to bother you  when someone  sits in the  chair of honor  today at nine  o'clock  it's going to  bother me  until i get  that honor  yeah  wow  jimmy is there  a chance  that he'll  get that  honor  uh we don't  we're looking  at this  continuing  we don't  know there's  been too  much of a  demand  and and i 
[01:47:00]  wanted bobo  in this seat  and all the  guys did  but uh for  some reason  just danny  and travis  felt you  didn't want  to do it  yeah the  company's  worried that  people are  going to be  fighting over  the chair  of honor  so they're  not even  sure they're  going to let  us do it  after uh  yeah  you know  next week  even  you said  you wanted  me  you could  tell me  told me  told me  early enough  well we  tried but  danny said  you don't  want to do  that we  assumed danny  would get  the message  to you  i don't  know what  to tell  you  he just  they never  tell me  on the phone  they just  tell me  call us  back  and they  would tell  tell me 
[01:47:30]  why  and sometimes  they're never  sure if it's  the best  with me  or to actually  legitimately tell  me that they  are  yeah i would  assume every  time that they  have something  for you  yeah  it was the  seat of honor  this time  yep  sometimes  they were  being available  to pick up  they couldn't  leave a message  specifically say  that  no but the  chair of honor  is a secret  we couldn't  just give that  away because  you might  tell everybody  we might  have the  seat at  at jim's  feet  feet  well that  the under  the console 
[01:48:00]  seat but you  don't want to  sit under  the console  well we  we do have  that for  for special  people  yeah under  the console  is kind  of  would you  consider the  under the  console seat  consider whatever  it's left  it is the  place of shame  they do call  it the  yeah that is  the place of shame  whatever's left  you're not  gonna be able  to see the  show though  it's really  under the  console  it's where we  have a listener  lay at our  feet like a  small animal  right  you'll have a  good view of  the chair of  honor though

What would Tyler Durden do?  What?  What did he do now?  I don't know  Just posted a great bunch, like 15 pictures of Avril Lavigne in a bikini on a boat 
[01:54:00]  She's still doing alright?  Dude, yeah  Look at, well, look  Oh, Jesus  Like, she's got her bikini on and she's poking her ass out  And, I mean, I know people are like, fuck her  I mean, come on  No, you gotta see these pictures  The pictures are fucking hot as fuck  Because I've never been a huge fan of her  I just like her music  But, wow  She's showing everyone where it goes  Yeah, she's  That's where you put it  She perches her shitter up real nice 
[01:54:30]  Look, this is where you put it  Yeah  Right here  Right here, when there's no doo-doo coming out  Your pee maker should be going in  No doo-doo coming out  Preferably after I've been up a couple hours  Yeah  To allow everything to exit before you enter it  Yeah, there's been a nice settle  There's nothing worse than an asshole right after you shit  You gotta give it time to settle  To settle?  Your asshole has to simmer down  Yeah, kind of like a building  You want it to all just settle  Yeah, it's gotta settle  Before you paint  It takes a while to settle  Don't worry, it's still settling

[01:55:30]  It's like, no, that's just my vagina  Sorry, sorry  Just my vagina  Nothing to worry about, sir  Yeah, those pictures  Somebody tipped me off to those this morning  And I've just had them up as a little inspiration  Look, you can see some butt crack right there  Some butt crack  More importantly, I'm wondering if I'm still allowed to sit in the chair of honor  When I get in here early and read the newspapers  Yeah, because you do move the chair of honor over  Am I allowed to sit in the chair of honor now, Jimmy?  Now that you've dubbed that chair the chair of honor? 
[01:56:00]  That's part of what makes it the chair of honor  Is that the host of the show  Reads his morning paper  And begins the show from the chair of honor  I kind of lounge for about a half hour  Read the papers  Have a little coffee  Look at the TV  In what is now known as the chair of honor  That chair of honor actually feels  The first indication that OPS to shit  In the morning  That's right  It's the chair of honor that feels that  That's right  There's actually a little dent  Where a lot of his logs have first tried to poke him out  Yeah, it's like when Foreman hits the heavy bag 
[01:56:30]  Ant just brought up something  I want to bring it out in the open  We're all gay  It's not you that's making me shit every morning  As soon as Anthony arrives, I get up with my newspaper  Get up and takes a shit  It's just a timing issue  Yeah, the perfect timing  I get here just slightly before you  And everything just, you know, comes about as you open the door  Yeah  I say good morning to Ant and I grab my newspaper and I'm out of here  It has nothing to do with you 
[01:57:00]  So  It's a timing thing  I assumed  I usually come in the same time  And, you know, your sphincter is on a  It's like a punch clock  I'm having an old man shit in the afternoons now  What do you mean?  I'm just telling my wife  I don't know  I used to be two or three in the morning and I'm done for the day  Now I got this old man shit in the afternoon thing happening  Yeah  You guys get one of those?  Um  I don't think so  Like my schedule completely changing  No  No, I'm on a pretty good schedule 
[01:57:30]  When do you shit?  Not here  We've never seen you  I don't have to here  Do you shit in the morning when you get up?  No  No  When the fuck do you shit?  Like right when I get home  But you got all that food from yesterday still in you?  No, no  It's like maybe a  A night time one  You have a night time shit?  Yeah  Before you go to bed  Yeah, something like that  Yeah, it works  It all works out  I shit in the afternoon usually  Like it was  Like  Jim Wise  My friend from 
[01:58:00]  One of Jay's writers  Said it best when he said  The telltale heaviness  In the back  That telltale heaviness  That you have to shit  Telltale  It's like a thick  Heavy feeling  And you just know  That you're not gonna make it  Oh boy  I had that on a plane recently  It was awful  And all you can think about  Is the fact that you gotta go  Yeah  Like what it would feel like  To sit there  And almost get that like  Tingle up your back  What's better  I understand why people  Would want to have their assholes 
[01:58:30]  Fuck brutally  Like what is better  Jesus  Than the feeling you get  From a good shit  Two of our zilches  Oh our zilches  Who are they  You wanna start bringing them in  Yeah might as well  We talked to them a little bit  What time  What time is the motherfucking  We're starting something called  The couch of zilches  Couch of zilches  Unfortunately we can't have  The live audience  Like we used to  We just  No  This place is way too  Fucking small  Yeah  Unfortunately  We would get a lot of 
[01:59:00]  New kind of characters  Bobo himself  Was a studio audience member  Back at the old studio  When we had a big audience  And that's how we got Bobo  You just reminded me  Of the live audience  In our bigger studio  Yeah  Bad mood for an hour and a half  Oh shit  Hour and a half  Hour and a half bad mood  Mark it  Mark the clock  This is an hour and a half  Bad mood  That I just  Suck into  Because now I'm reminded  Of what it used to be  And by the way Anthony  Yeah  I gotta leave right at  10 o'clock today  I'm sorry  So do I 
[01:59:30]  Sorry to do this to you  But you're gonna have to  Meet with him by yourself  No I have to leave at 10  Exactly at 10  You too  Yeah  I do  I even said it in a phone call  A recent phone call  That I received  That was a preamble  To this meeting  This alleged tentative meeting  And I said that  Friday's not good  Got stuff to do  And I said  I'll gladly meet Monday  I can't do Monday  You can't do Monday?

[02:00:30]  As in you know  It's cute  You know  And there was dead silence  As me and Sam  Continued leaking  And then he slowly  Cleaned his hands  And dried them  How much silence  And awkwardness  Was there in the bathroom  Just now Sam  You're allowed to talk  Because I'm asking  It was a quiet  Trip to the bathroom  It was  Usually there's some chatting  I would think  No chit chat  I thought he would say  Something like  Hey the show sounds good  So far  Or hey how's your morning  Going  Yeah  Jim and I had an exchange  When Jim was leaving 
[02:01:00]  Talking about intern David  Of jizz  Yeah  Exactly  We passed it quietly  From my balls to his mouth  Like thanks a million  Smuggle this out of here kid  Shit it out when you get home  How far am I gonna go with this  That's funny  And then after that  It was quiet  Yeah  Really quiet  Like  Is he mad  A little too quiet  I mean I don't know  If he's mad  I don't care if he's mad  I'm just wondering  You don't  Well now he probably is  Why  I would be  I'm just  Out of curiosity  I'm wondering  But I don't care if he is

[02:25:00]  To kind of switch over to you guys  It took a little bit  To get into the show  It does  It does  It does  It took me a while  To get into it  I'm still not fully sold  Exactly  I'm still half and half  On the fucking shows  I walk in here every morning  Thinking this show stinks  I gotta be honest  With this gentleman  They really don't like us  Talking about the fact  That he's only working  Six days in July  In nine days in August  No  No no no  They really don't want us  Talking about that  They don't  They don't  So  Yeah Jimmy  So steer clear of that  I know  Thank you Kenny  We might want to show you  A schedule that we came upon  Somebody leaked something

[02:26:30]  That could be an issue  You know  I think Sam got a big  A big interview  Coming up at 10 o'clock  This morning  Oh really?  Sister Hazel  There's another band  Yeah I know  You are aren't you  Who's Sister Hazel  They're playing over at Fox  That's that fucking band  That was keeping everyone awake  When we drove up  What song did they play?  I don't remember  I think they had one hit  But I  I have a strong feeling  That Sam's going to be interviewing them  Just like he did Loverboy  Because it's the same stage 
[02:27:00]  Yeah  The Fox stage  They do every morning  Or Friday mornings  If I get Weird Al and Sister Hazel  In the same week  Weird Al is legit  Dare to dream  Oh alright  I know this tone  Do I?  Or does it sound like  500 other ones  I'm talking over it  That sounds like  Yeah  Blues Traveler  Blues Traveler  Without the fat guys  Oh it sounds like  Mr  Jones?  Yeah  A little bit of that too  So I thought it was 
[02:27:30]  Alright let's turn that down  Or off  Alright so that guy  Used to listen to Stern  He's given us a shot  Or has for a while now  And we definitely appreciate that  So is he in the lead Jimmy?

Fabian  Fabian  Fabian  How'd you get that name?  By the way  I was originally going to be called  Fernando  But my uncle  My uncle was like  You know  That sounds too Hispanic 
[02:28:00]  So  Wanted to just randomly  Change it to Fabian  So  Not Fabian  But Fabian  And  That's it  So that's cool  You don't want to sound too Hispanic  You might as well sound like  A 50's teen idol  Exactly  So  My whole grammar school year  Really  Way to keep it under the radar  Yeah  That's the way  You know  Turn it off  Turn it off  That's the way to kind of keep it  You know quiet  And blend right in  Yeah  Right  Alright so  Sorry  Yeah no  I just  For like the first  20 years of my life  Oh your mom must have named you  After the singer  I have no idea who the singer is 
[02:28:30]  You don't know who that Fabian guy is  I don't know what he does  I gotta ask you a controversial question  That came up recently on our show  Oh yes  Thanks to Mars  Maybe Mars could come in and ask the question  That's right  Mars  You want Mars to do it or should we do it  Let Mars ask  I think  Is Mars close by  Mars is his  Oh man look at him  He's a Johnny on the spot  He's Hispanic  Jesus Christ  And he made some crazy allegations  I don't know if you were listening that day  Mars is listening  Mars is listening  Is he dead or  What the hell is it 
[02:29:00]  From West Side Story  Andre  Andre  Yeah  Yeah  Que fue  Mars  Fabian  Hola  What about Fabian  Fabian what kind of Hispanic are you  Ecuadorian  You know about the Ecuadorians there Mars  Yeah  Do you guys like each other  Because I know different Hispanic people don't like other ones  Mars you're Puerto Rican  Like the Puerto Ricans  Yes  And Colombians hate each other  Right  Right  Really why  Only when they're in their respective groups  Puerto Ricans and Mexicans don't like each other 
[02:29:30]  But I don't understand why you hate someone that looks like you  Oh boy  We don't look the same  Oh boy  Oh boy  We're better looking  Absolutely  Now  Hi Mars  How do you feel about those short Peruvian women with those bowler hats  They're sexy  I fucked a hat right off her  You ever see them  They all look like they're just  Coming down mountains with tobacco on their back  So Colombians and Puerto Ricans don't typically get along  I didn't know that  Yeah 
[02:30:00]  Did I know that  Do your Puerto Rican friends look at you and go like  Hey look you're not Colombian  You shouldn't have a torso like Pablo Escobar  Sorry  A long way to go for kind of a fat joke  For guys in much better shape than I am  My apologies  I didn't mean that  It's for the radio  I think honestly that the hatred comes from us not needing paperwork  To stay in this country  Ah see  And you're like  Hey motherfucker  Yeah  I'm an American  This is how you do it  Well why don't you ask Fabian about what you told us 
[02:30:30]  Los niños  Oh yeah  Okay  I was telling these cats  Wait  I do it in Spanish  Oh really  Does he know Spanish  Yes  Speak Spanish  Yes  Yes  I was telling these people  Uncle Paul  Sorry kids  In the Hispanic family  There are many cases  That  Ties  To play  On their family  Uncles  I always hear that  Uncle's touching it  I always hear that  Not in my family 
[02:31:00]  Not in my family  No  I always heard that  Thank you  What the hell  We would get fired if we said this  Wow  But because Mars is  We're alright  But it's  Mars basically  If you weren't listening  I think it was last week  Last Friday or something  No it was recent  I've heard it  Oh you didn't hear  Mars swears that fucking uncles  Are touching kids  In Hispanic families  Left and right  Hey  Habla Espanol  Oh no  Those  Trace  Those are the only ages  Now also with that 
[02:31:30]  I want to also add  Like I started  Saying yesterday  That  As a father  We love our kids  Okay  And this doesn't go  A little too much  No no no  Oh sorry  It's the uncles  With the nieces  And the nephews  Really  But also  It's not tolerated  It just gets  They get away with it  They don't do it  For some  Forcibly  I'm Tio Pablo  Tio Pablo's very nice  To the kids 
[02:32:00]  Yeah  Yeah  He gives a lot of  You know  Love and affection  And gifts  So the kids  He's bamboozling them  Into  Doing something  Instead of just  Physically pinning them down  Right  And what happens  If you get caught  If you don't tolerate it  Then you got the  Latino hot temper  The father  Oh shit  Cut your balls off  What do we do?  Matar  Stabia maybe?  Sticking is good  Really  Sticking is a good thing  Bats are very good  Oh wow  Sure  Bats are good

I don't know  Like I guess recently  I had to spend like $3,000  Just to go to Chile  Which is very expensive 
[02:35:00]  For some reason  Why did you have to go to Chile?  My girlfriend's from Chile  And she wants to visit her family  Oh  And she was there last year  During the earthquake  She was there  Love the sea bass  Yeah  For some reason  She wants to go back  And  Chile is right down the street  No  Not that  That's  Good ones  Alright well  You had to go to Chile  So you needed $3,000 to go to Chile?  Yeah  How'd you get it?  It's pretty expensive  I mean 
[02:35:30]  I had a travel agent  It's like  Yeah  It costs about $1,500 a person  Just for flight  For a coach?  Yeah I mean  I've had the money  It's just the fact that I just wish  You had to spend it on that  Yeah  $3,000  I mean  I just wish she was from Florida or something  Right  God  Why should it be down there?  I mean  Even Ecuador costs like $500  Everywhere else in South America  Costs like $500, $600  Except for Chile  You have rolled up pant legs  And brown shoes  And light blue socks  Could be the worst lower half of a person  I've seen in 20 years  Does that get me the truth? 
[02:36:00]  Maybe  No so far  Who's in the lead?  I would have to say the guy from Connecticut  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  Because he's  What about the guy that has to shit?  Look how he's sitting now  Yeah  Is that why you're sitting?

[02:40:30]  This is Brian Cox  Hey, this is Chaz Palmaturi  Hey, this is Danny McFry  Hey, this is David DeCover  Hey, this is Michael Madsen  You're listening  to Opie and Anthony.  I don't know why,  but I'm still trying to figure out  what the hell the show's about. 
[02:41:00]  Thanks, Michael.  Well, Jimmy, the time has come.  We have the Couch of Zilches.  Four fine listeners of the show.  We're going to do this every Friday, by the way.  Facebook is where they go?  When the contest is open,  we'll post an update on Facebook  slash Opie and Anthony,  and then you'll email in after that.  Probably the first four, random four.  Yeah, you'll figure it out after that.  Four that aren't Bobo.  I don't know what we'll do. 
[02:41:30]  I wish I had Bobo on the phone  because right now we're about to pick the person  that gets to sit basically in Bobo's chair.  Let's do this.  The chair of honor.  The one word, chair of honor, sit off.  How about this?  Because Bobo refused the chair of honor,  he just didn't want it.  Which one?  We would like to do a quick word association.  Um, every one of you,  I would like you just to come up with one word for Bobo.  Go.  Numbskull. 
[02:42:00]  Retarded.  Creepy.  Smock.  All accurate.  So nobody would lose points for that.  But I'm going to have to go with, uh,  my instinct said the guy from Connecticut.  Yeah, because he's got his shit.  And, uh, no, no, no.  I like him.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The guy from Connecticut who was a converted fan.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I would have went with the guy that has to shit.  Oh, well, could let Anthony be the deciding factor? 
[02:42:30]  Look at him slouching.  It's getting bad.  It really is.  It's getting bad.  Anthony, just whatever, whatever you say,  guy that has to shit,  uh, guy who was Howard fan from Connecticut.  Yeah.  Or he might have, uh...  Oh, you know what?  Yes, we have a, we have a real couch of...  It could be a three-way tie.  Chair of honor.  Who do you want in the chair of honor, Anthony?  Me and Jimmy have made our decisions.  Wow.  Were you a, uh, was there a tie?  Was there...  No, we got, we picked a different guy.  We picked two different guys.  So who do you want? 
[02:43:00]  So you can either break the tie or make it a three-way tie.  I'm going to go with, um...  I think I'm going to go with poor, I have to shit guy.  Oh!  You are the winner.  It was a tough fought battle.  Sir, you...  No, no, let Kenny do the honors.  Kenny, sir, please.  Give him the royal treatment.  Sir, allow me to help you into the chair of honor.  Easy, easy.  Careful.  Careful.  This way.  Careful.  Watch the wire.  Watch the wire.  It's a six-foot block.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold it, hold it. 
[02:43:30]  Let me brush it off for you.  Oh, Kenny's brushing the chair of honor off.  There.  And he's taking a seat.  Ah, how does that feel?  Would you like to recline, sir?  I'm very comfortable, thanks.  Would you like a nice sugary beverage from the kitchen?  Sugar.  Sugar.  Sugar.  You don't want a sugary beverage?  We have everything.  It's the one good thing about this place.  They have a wonderful sugar beverage.  Sugary beverage.  Take a tissue and some blueberries.  Wow, what an honor.  What was his sugary beverage of choice? 
[02:44:00]  He picked an iced tea.  Ooh.  Ah, good choice.  Would you like your straw?  Yes, please.  Oh.  An ice?  A cup of ice?  No, I'm all good.  Thank you.  Okay.  Wow.  Can he put his feet up?  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Look at that.  Look, see?  He's got a little stick shift recliner.  Sure does.  An old grandpa chair.  Yeah.  He's got a lovely recliner.  Oh, look at the other people.  We have another nice parting gift for him. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah?  A box of Trojans.  Oh, a lot of boxes of Trojans.  That's a lot of condoms right there.  That sure is.  Do you use condoms, my friend?  I do not.  No.  Got a boy.  Yeah, yeah.  Good man.  Good man.  Good man.  Good man.  That's my own heart.  What are these?  Finger protectors?  Yeah, I don't like those things at all.  Please don't fart in the chair of honor.  We're going to need the chair for next Friday.  Are we?  Are they bummed out they didn't get the chair of honor?  How do you feel?  A little bummed? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, pretty bummed.  You opened yourself up?  That's all right.  Oh, Jimmy voted for you.  Oh, okay.  That's all right.  I'm sorry.  I'm comfortable with our choice, too.  You know what?  I had to go with this gentleman here because he inspired me.  To shit?  Yeah, I actually was like, you know something?  I feel a little percolating.  I feel some rumbling.  On the morning we talked about how you never shit.  I know.  I felt like I had to go in there and do something.  I just felt I had to.  And I think I was inspired.  So that is why you, sir, are sitting in there, that chair, and not this gentleman there. 
[02:45:30]  I apologize.  You think of the better story later.  That's how it works.  Yeah, I hear you.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  You know what?  I hear Seth Gordon's here.  We're just kind of stalling.  What?  Is he?  He's the director of Horrible Bosses.  Jesus.  What does he want?  A solid eight minutes of fucking airtime?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Today's not to be.  9 to 41?  Yeah.  Yes.  I have to be somewhere, so we can't stay late tonight.  I know.  So does Anthony.  I hope they know that.  I hope they know that.  Oh, but then again, you could always end the show a few minutes early.  Nope! 
[02:46:00]  You don't want to do that?  I don't want my weekend wrecked with a bad mood.  The bad mood maker.  Right.  You don't want to do that, huh?  How would I feel for the next two days if we had a meeting today?  Yes.  No, the bad mood would go to Monday.  I'm not even exaggerating.  Wait, so first it would be till Monday.  Yeah.  Saturday it would be.  And then you'd wake up on Sunday?  Sunday it would be kind of like it would come back.  Oh, so you'd wake up.  It would subside Sunday, but I'd still be in a slightly bad mood. 
[02:46:30]  And then as I know, I have to now come back after the bad meeting.  Yes, then Sunday night's going to be bad.  So as you realize Sunday was coming to an end, tomorrow is Monday.  Yeah, then it would subside Monday when I see the guys and we start having the laughs.  But not until the show starts.  Then you're back here again.  Huh?  Then you're back here again.  Oh, I like being here.  Yeah, but you know, you're in fucking...  I like this part of this.  You got that view of...  No, I like being here.  I don't want people to be confused.  This I like.  Yeah.  Everything else associated with this I fucking hate. 
[02:47:00]  That hallway looks like you're looking down a throat.  Yeah.  Just into where a yawn would begin.  Oh, Kenny's back with a sugary beverage of choice.  We're ready for the presentation.  You'll get the special treatment, sir.  Of the sugary beverage.  This is very, very special.  You need a mic, Kenny?  Yes.  Okay.  Careful.  Careful.  Sir, as you...  Careful.  Here is your sugary beverage.  This is the presentation.  He really did open that up very elegantly. 
[02:47:30]  By the way, enjoy yourself.  We're going to be doing this every Friday.  We're going to be doing this every fucking Friday.  Every Friday.  There will be a new Lucky Stiff.  Whether you like it or not.  In the chair of honor.  Can we hear from Bobo really fast before the director comes in?  Now that we officially have someone in the Bobo chair?  We've been calling him.  He hasn't picked up.  His mother probably broke the phone across his teeth.  Okay.  Yeah, she was none too happy.  No.  So you'd wake up on Saturday and still be in a bad mood. 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  You wouldn't sleep it off.  I guess it's about time I admit to all this.  Yeah.  My moods are horrible.  And they last way longer than the average person.  Wow.  That would...  Especially on a Friday night because you'd think you have a nice sleep.  You could wake up whenever you want on Saturday.  What kind of chemical is released into my body?  While you sleep?  When I get in a bad mood and then it takes a while.  And you can't sleep it off?  Like you wake up and you're...  No.  No.  I just can't fathom.  No.  If I meet with him today, my weekend will be ruined. 
[02:48:30]  Maybe you'll feel better.  Maybe things will get accomplished.  No!  What if he's got the answers you're looking for?  Oh, really?  After two years of promises?  Oh.  Get the fuck out of here.  Horrible Boss is a terrific movie.  Nice seg.  Anthony, what else can we talk about as we wait for this guy?  I don't know what else is in the news or the snooze, as I like to call it.  We could throw it to the couch of zilches.  Anything in the news you guys found fascinating? 
[02:49:00]  Boy, the name is appropriate.  Oh, we got Bobo.  Never mind.  We'll make it quick, I promise.  Bobo?  Yeah, I'm here.  Well, it's official.  We got a fine young gentleman that has to shit sitting in the chair of honor.  Yeah, true fan.  You should have been the first to be in the chair of honor, but for some reason you just  didn't want it.  You told Danny that you didn't want to be here.  Right. 
[02:49:30]  And this is where we are right now.  How do you feel that you know someone else is in the chair of honor?  And his name will always be on the plaque as the first one.  Yeah.  Well, congratulations on being the first one.  I might not be the first one, but I'll get my turn.  Where?  How are you going to get your turn?  We explained that we're sold out for a long time like the Book of Mormon.  It's hard to get tickets for this.  Yeah.  Well, if you're going to treat it like season tickets to the New York Giants, then I'll  put my name on that waiting list. 
[02:50:00]  Where do you want to sit?  No, it's in the chair of honor.  The chair of honor.  But that's booked solid, and the couch of Zilchers is booked solid.  The seat at Jimmy's feet is maybe available.  Run to the console where you can look at the relaxed feet of whoever is reclining in  the chair of honor.  Yes.  You're not going to be able to see the show, but at least you'll be in the studio at 
[02:50:30]  Jimmy's feet.  Yes.  That might be available.  We're not sure.  All right.  I'll take tickets available.  All right.  I'll take it.  That's hilarious.  Bobo's voice sounds like his face is always, what is it, packed with snot.  What?  Face packed with snot.  Holy shit, it does.  Gah.  Hey, hey, is that my pal Travis?  Who's that?  Is that my pal Travis? 
[02:51:00]  Hey, Travis, how are you?  Who's this?  I'm good, Mrs. Bobo.  How are you?  Oh, hi, Opie and Anthony.  You're on the air.  You're on the air.  Okay.  I'm actually on the air.  Yeah.  I just want to give a shout out to my pal Travis.  I actually like talking to him.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  Oh, you talk to Travis a lot?  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Once in a while.  He's a cool guy.  I know he means well.  We mean well.  How's Bobo doing?  He's doing fine.  Yeah.  I'll go back on the line. 
[02:51:30]  I didn't know I was on the air.  No, he's a little bummed that he didn't get the chair of honor today, and he's blaming  you.  He what?  He wanted the chair of honor today, but he's blaming you because you didn't get the email  in in time.  What do kids do best?  What do kids do best?  They blame the mother.  If it's a serial killer, they blame the parents.  Sure.  There you go.  Ready?  Bye-bye.  Jesus.  Which one is crazier?  Bobo, we got to move on.  All right.  Thanks.  Anyway, I guess I'll put myself on the waiting list. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, well.  You're going to have to email.  There's no other chairs we could give him, Jimmy?  No.  No, no, no.  The shamed fan chair he might get.  Yeah.  Which is in the hallway facing away from the studio.  Will you take that one, Bobo?  Uh, it's nowhere near anything.  Just like your Mets tickets, you fuck.  Ah, get it?  No, the Mets tickets are actually in the ballpark.  Oh, he's quick.  They're in the ballpark. 
[02:52:30]  He's quick.  Not there, but in the ballpark.  They actually are in the stands.  Right, you know.  Yeah, yes.  I was stalling.  You'd be a terrific comedian.  I don't know where this Seth Gordon is.  What's your dog's name?  I don't want to mention this.  My dog's name, Mr. Maloonigan.  And what kind of dog is he?  He's a schnoodle.  I'm actually going to start a Twitter campaign to see if any fans could offer me better seats.  And if I can get maybe at least the 300, you go. 
[02:53:00]  No.  This segment is dying a slow death.  Yeah, we got to acknowledge that this is really bad and cut our losses.  Death.  But why don't you congratulate the guy that's sitting in your chair, the chair of honor.  All right, congratulations.  Why don't you sing the Bill Tetley song for your mother?  All right, Mom.  This is for you.  B-I-L-O-T-E-A-Y.  Bill Tetley.  B-I-L-O-T-E-A-Y. 
[02:53:30]  Bill T-E.  We got to play the Bill Tetley F.U.'s one more time before we get out of here today.  Classic.  We got him, Travis?  He's still babbling.  What the hell is going on?  I thought he was here.  Yeah, I thought he was here.  Huh?  Huh.  E-Rock, why did you say he was downstairs?  Eric did.  I got a call.  I thought he said they were waiting for the guest that he was here.  He's got cake in his ears again.  Oh.  You have cake in your ears?  Yeah.  Why do you have cake in your ears?  Why were you pointing, Eric, you just railed the whole segment because you pointed down 
[02:54:00]  towards that big stomach and you said that he's here, he's here.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  So we're stalling for a couple minutes.  What happened?  Again, I got a call saying they were waiting for the guest.  I thought he was here.  Waiting for him?  So I told you, I was like, he's here.  But he's not here.  I didn't know that.  So why would we just...  They wouldn't be waiting for him if he was.  I'm going to have to change my like to dislike about this movie if he doesn't come in.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  It's fine either way.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to have to do that.  Roland said he was in a cab and the cabbie took like a completely long loop around way. 
[02:54:30]  Where was he coming from?  I don't know where he was from.  How about Roland give some info?  Exactly.  This is the wrong day, though, because I really have to be somewhere by 1015.  Will you be?  I have things to do.  That's why we can't do the meeting today.  Hey, Elijah Wood was in yesterday.  Bobo, we got to let you go.  Chair of Honor.  Maybe someday.  Thank God.  You can dream, okay?  I want to hear Bobo, we got to let you go when we're holding him up in the edge of a canyon by his hand.  We would never travel to a canyon with him.  Well, I sort of, ah, you got to suspend disbelief. 
[02:55:00]  Give T.O. Pablo a kiss.  Kiss.  Crazy Hispanics.  Yeah.  Travis just handed me something that's definitely worth playing before Seth Gordon.  Yeah.  What happened?  We noticed something about Elijah Wood?  Is that what's going on here?  Oh.  Should I just play it?  Yeah, just play it.  All right.  Elijah Wood was in yesterday, and we noticed something.  And now, Hollywood actor, A-list celebrity, and Frodo Baggins himself. 
[02:55:30]  Elijah Wood says yeah 80 times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Totally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's been a pleasure. Yeah, you guys are awesome.  That was Frodo Baggins himself saying yeah. Yeah, I know, right? 80 times. 
[02:56:30]  Like, I don't even know how I could process that. It's so awesome. Oh, my God. Wow. I didn't even notice. It's amazing.  Didn't even notice.  Yeah.  Good job on that.  Really good job on that.  Sounds like those space monsters on Sesame Street that eat the phones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Guys, a big time.  You don't remember that.  Big time director coming in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  Seth Gordon.  He did King of Kong, I heard.  Yes, he did.  Yes.  We're very big fans of that.  Seth Gordon made it. 
[02:57:00]  Hey, you made all that New York traffic.  What are you going to do?  Yes.  Yeah.  Seth, Opie, Anthony.  Hey, how you doing?  Jim Norton.  Hi.  How are you?  The couch of zilchers behind you?  We're trying a new concept.  We're just bringing people in off the streets.  Okay.  And trying to see if there's any personality there.  Sure.  Just something.  So on Friday, we bring in, we call it the couch of zilchers.  But we forgot about the chair of honor, too.  And then we pick one of the zilchers to sit in the chair of honor.  The chair of honor.  Nice.  He got it because he had to take his shit. 
[02:57:30]  That's the only reason he's there.  He had to take his shit, so we gave him the chair of honor.  Seth, I went to the movie last night.  Yeah.  And you stood up and you talked to the crowd, which I thought was awesome.  You didn't have to be there.  And then the movie started.  And I got to tell you, I love this fucking movie.  Thank you so much.  I said it was better than Hangover 2 just because I haven't seen a lot of comedies lately.  And I know that's kind of a barometer because a lot of people love the Hangover movies.  Your movie's way the fuck better.  Wow.  Who wrote it?  Originally, it was Mike Markowitz who came up with the idea and wrote the first pass. 
[02:58:00]  And then these two great writers, Goldstein and Daly, did the recent pass, the one I read.  Right.  And I was crying laughing when I read it.  Yeah, the writing is great.  Just so funny.  It's really funny.  It's edgy.  Yeah.  You guys definitely don't hold back.  And you got Charlie Day, which is, he's now a movie star officially.  You think?  Because of you and horrible bosses.  Yeah, he's incredible.  I mean, I'm surprised that he's not better known already, honestly.  Right.  But I was thrilled that he could be in this. 
[02:58:30]  Well, there's a lot of fans of Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  We're all just sitting around waiting for Charlie Day to finally get his moment.  Yeah.  And I think he's got it now.  I sure hope so.  He deserves to be recognized for the talent that he is.  Right.  And he was so amazing to have on set because he's a writer and a showrunner from Sunny.  Right.  So every day we were, you know, kicking the tires on the scenes and making sure they were  shaping up with the characters as they were evolving as we were putting the movie on its  feet.  And you need someone with real chops to be able to shape a movie with you as you go. 
[02:59:00]  Right.  As opposed to saying, hey, I learned my lines.  That's it.  That's not Charlie.  As you can see, he's constantly finding nooks and crannies to put little pieces  of funny.  Did he give you a lot of improv?  There's some improv.  I would say improv is this a bit of a misnomer for how we do it because the scenes always  stay the same point of view and the same story.  But then there's different ways to find ways to say lines. 
[02:59:30]  You know what I mean?  And that's what a great writer can do, is discover new ways of phrasing stuff.  And you saw the way their chemistry was, was just incredible, the three of them.  And so the idea behind the scene was on the page, but we would find a new way to do it  every day.  And for the people that don't know yet, we're seeing the trailers.  What is Horrible Bosses about in your words?  It's about three guys stuck in their jobs.  They just hate their jobs and they especially hate their bosses for different reasons. 
[03:00:00]  And, and it seems like their only way out because they can't get a new job for, you  know, one reason or another is to try to kill their bosses.  Right.  And, uh, it's, it's, uh, Jamie Foxx who becomes their murder consultant.  I, can I say his name on this show?  Oh, I don't care.  Motherfucker Jones.  Oh, you mean his name in the movie?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, of course.  We could curse here.  Yeah.  All right, good.  Motherfucker Jones, uh, they go to is their, you know, they think he'll be a hit man. 
[03:00:30]  And he turns and he says, I'm, I'll be your murder consultant.  Right.  But I will tell you guys are the best plan is to try to kill each other's bosses.  And they go into a really scary, uh, black bar because they went into the hood.  It's a little scary for these guys.  Yeah.  And you have, you have Cuddy as the bar owner from The Wire.  Yeah.  Isn't that awesome?  It's really awesome.  Chad Coleman.  Yeah, he's great.  Because we're, we're all Wire fans.  Yeah.  That was, uh, we were so happy he could join us that day.  Yeah.  Did I, what made you want to get him and Wendell Pierce?  Was it because they were in The Wire?  I love The Wire.  Oh, you do? 
[03:01:00]  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  We could, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to get along.  And actually, Charlie knew Chad and the, the guy we thought was going to be that bartender.  All of a sudden, another movie wouldn't let him out of his obligations.  So we had to scramble and Chad said yes and was available.  And I mean, it was a great, he did great.  And he got bunk to be bunk.  I know.  He was, he was being bunk for you.  He was being bunk.  Yeah.  There's no way, no other way to, you know, spin that.  Man, who better to play that guy, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I know diehard Wire fans will just appreciate that he's in there. 
[03:01:30]  Absolutely, I did.  And I think everyone else will just see what a great actor he is.  And speaking of that, a lot of cameos.  Yeah.  A lot of, a lot of people, you know, popping up in this movie.  Yeah.  I tell you, Ron White was there just for a moment, right?  Yeah.  I wasn't sure if you want to like give away that.  All right.  That's fine.  Whatever you want to give away.  Yeah.  Ron White's in the movie.  I didn't see it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that's, he was there for that same brief period of time.  His, he, you know how funny he is.  He did that one line that is in every single trailer because he nailed that, you know, 
[03:02:00]  he was with us just for a second and just delivered gold.  I didn't see it.  I know.  I feel left out.  Yeah.  It's, I, you're going to love it.  I got to see this now.  The only flaw I have with horrible bosses, and it's a good flaw.  Yeah.  Who wouldn't fuck Jennifer Aniston?  Well, that we, I mean, I know you explain it in the movie, but she looks, I came in here  like dying over how hot she is in this movie.  I know.  It's crazy, isn't it?  And there was no body doubles, right?  Because I was looking for that shit. 
[03:02:30]  Not at all.  And I, there's people who say things like, oh, they do Photoshop or whatever.  Not a thing.  Not a thing.  I mean, that's just photography.  She's ridiculous.  It's a, yep.  And she's 41-ish.  Somewhere around there.  I don't even know exactly.  Did you do extra takes on those just like to keep her clothes a little off?  Some of those more slinky shots.  There's DVD extras.  Yeah.  See?  See?  I'll wait for those.  I can't wait to talk about this movie in depth after a lot of people see it because 
[03:03:00]  I can't even say what I want to say.  Fuck.  I ran home to tell my wife about one scene and she was howling.  Which one?  It was in the dentist's office.  Oh, yeah.  A little blackmailing going on.  Yeah.  And she picked up her up.  My wife shot those photos.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Okay.  That was fun.  Picked up her, you know.  The blackmail.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I might have put Charlie Day in some positions that he didn't know about for some black men.  I don't want to give away some of those.  Oh, I actually think that's...  Do you want to give it away? 
[03:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's fine.  I'll just give it away.  So Jennifer Aniston is a real bitch.  She wants to sleep with Charlie Day and Charlie's like, no, I'm married.  I mean, I got a fiance.  We're getting married.  And somehow Jennifer Aniston gets his wife in the chair and knocks her out with gas for  some free dental procedure or whatever.  And all of a sudden, she goes, all right, fuck me on her body.  Now, while she's passed out, Charlie's like, I'm not going to do this.  And then Jennifer Aniston goes, well, I'll just tell her that you fucked me. 
[03:04:00]  And Charlie Day's like, she's never going to believe that.  And then all of a sudden, she pulls out her iPad and goes, oh, really?  But she might believe this.  Remember when you first started with me and I put you under for a little procedure?  Well, guess what happened?  And there's pictures of Charlie Day completely out of it, like Weekend at Bernie's, being  put in all sorts of weird sexual positions, like he was having sex with Jennifer Aniston.  Yeah, she just was blackmailing him.  And that's where Charlie's character snaps.  And he's fully into this plan now, because he's the one guy that isn't quite ready to go 
[03:04:30]  along with it.  But if the kids see that, is that a good one?  Do not take your children.  You get like 15 youngest.  An odd thing Opie mentioned, I didn't see it, but there was something he mentioned, which  was kind of cool.  It's a silly thing now, but the Jennifer Aniston calls a faggot, which is like, which is great  because that's real language.  That's where people talk.  That's the way they insult each other.  We grew up just saying that, not thinking how deep the word is and all that crap. 
[03:05:00]  Not meaning the greater implication of it.  And has there been any flack for any of the language at all or no?  Well, truly, we removed a lot of that from the movie in post.  But we'd shot the movie, and there were certain other things, like Colin Farrell's character  goes there because he's, in a way, closeted.  It's revealed very subtly later in the movie.  But he always calls people names, and it turns out it's really part of his fetishes.  And we just eliminated that for the simple reason that we want to steer away from the 
[03:05:30]  politics around that, because that's really not what the movie's about.  But that particular one.  So he was calling everybody a fag?  Yeah.  And then it turns out he's gay?  And then you see this male prostitute leave his house who's, like, in drag.  Oh, yeah.  That would have been a great statement, though.  That didn't make the movie.  That's a great statement.  Unfortunately, because that would have so worked for his character.  It's in there.  It just was in there a lot before.  Like, it was very obvious.  Yeah.  Okay.  But I'm glad you left the Jennifer Aniston. 
[03:06:00]  I told these guys I'm a little worried that maybe they'll take that line out before  July 8th.  But you're all in.  Oh, we're all in.  Good for you, man.  What you saw was final, final.  Funny's funny, man.  Yeah, we can't.  I mean, at some point, it is the way people talk to each other.  And as long as you're, you know, she's a crazy person in this movie.  And that's part of her attempt to try to seduce him is to kind of bully him.  Right.  As a director, because you guys are creative guys.  The actors are creative. 
[03:06:30]  But those type of decisions, they come from above.  I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like usually somebody, what happens?  You get a note and they go, look.  Not even with this, but with anything.  You know, it's interesting.  Because Hangover is so successful and really paved the way, I think, in recent years for  hard R comedy, the kind of policing of those things is left up much more to the creative  team than you would expect, given, you know, the multi-national corporation stuff.  Yeah, there's a pushback going on a little bit.  Yeah.  We always bitch and complain on the show. 
[03:07:00]  But you got to acknowledge at this point that there is a pushback going on with comedies.  Finally.  Yeah.  Oh, you mean people are going for it again?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  And I think there's a fine line where you don't want to dabble at, like, outright prejudice  or whatever.  Oh, yeah, no.  But at the same time, it just, relax, everybody.  This is comedy.  And this character's bananas.  Right.  And, you know, you got to let, you got to, it's a story.  Now, you were there before the movie started.  Did you kind of just hang around and see what the crowd reaction was?  Oh, yeah.  Or have you already checked out crowds? 
[03:07:30]  A few times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's so fun to watch with the crowd.  They were howling last night.  Yeah.  They were howling.  You were at the AMC.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I was sitting with this guy, Roland, who goes to every single movie.  And I go to a lot of the previews with him.  He sleeps during every fucking movie.  And then he'll come in here and say how amazing the movie is.  It's like, how can you even do that?  But he didn't sleep last night.  That's good.  That's why I know this is going to be really good.  Nice.  So, I was going to ask a question, too, but I forgot.  Oh, King of Kong. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Are you still in touch with Billy Mitchell?  Occasionally, yeah.  He's actually, he, you know, it's through the many tentacles of his, like, existence.  But we have, he has now founded an arcade at the Orlando Airport called the King of Kong  Arcade.  He took all the posters and all the artwork and just is using it.  I'm just going to see how long that'll last.  And he actually has a King of Kong hot sauce with him on it.  And never surrender, never, and everything. 
[03:08:30]  Now, we are huge fans of King of Kong.  Oh, great.  Is that your first movie?  Yeah, it's first feature.  Wow.  First feature.  It's amazing.  Thank you.  We quote it all the time.  Oh, my God.  And we reference it all the time.  It's, you know, it's just one of those crazy stories, you know?  Did you think you had something when you started filming that?  Absolutely not.  I mean, I had gone to that arcade fun spot in New Hampshire since I was a kid.  And it's like my favorite place in the world.  I grew up in Chicago, but our family would have reunions up in New Hampshire. 
[03:09:00]  And that arcade, it was just a pilgrimage.  And then they had the Wall of Fame.  And then Billy's all over the Wall of Fame.  And then a friend of mine met Steve Wiebe right after they went to his garage.  And we went and met Billy.  And we were like, I don't know what this is or what it's going to become.  But this guy's interesting, especially compared to Steve.  And then, obviously, all his shenanigans couldn't have been predicted.  And then, eventually, we had a movie.  But I thought it was such a niche, bizarre, weird subculture that no one would possibly care about. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, no one knew that was going on.  Yeah.  But these guys still gave a shit about their video game scores.  Yeah.  And that it had to be this perfect way in a certain kind of machine.  It's just so extreme.  Yeah.  I didn't think anybody could possibly connect with it.  The videotape stuff where it's like, this isn't legit.  Yeah.  Because it was on video, but it wasn't sanctioned or watched by a guy.  Exactly.  What?  What?  Really?  There's also so many things I couldn't fit in the feature. 
[03:10:00]  Just because there's so much gold.  But Billy's first tape that he sent up there for everyone to watch was accidentally just a tape of WWE.  They put it in to watch it like, this is going to be the big Donkey Kong performance.  And it's just, you know, pile drivers and whatever.  That shit, if there's extra footage of that, have you thought of putting out an extended DVD?  I think you should do an extended DVD.  There is definitely an audience for that.  It's a cult following that.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  There are some extras, but there's even more.  Yeah.  Go in, find some of the shit that was cut out and pop that on there.  People would love every bit of that.  Extra, like Lemmy's Blu-ray has like an extra five hours on the Blu-ray.  You could do that now.  You could put extra hours.  That's true.  You just watch as much as you want or don't want to watch.  You know, it's not a matter of room anymore on the disc.  Yeah, we should.  And Weeby's actually in Horrible Bosses, the third shot in.  Oh, really?  Try to have him in everything.  Wait, he's in the movie? 
[03:11:00]  Weeby is in that.  I didn't see him in the movie.  You know in space he says he's going to fire the security guard?  Yes.  Well, the guy that he runs by is Weeby at the beginning of the movie.  You just put him in there.  I just liked him playing the role of an unexpected victim.  Right.  It's just, you know.  How was it working with Kevin Spacey?  He's just amazing, right?  Yeah.  I think he had a lot of fun just getting to be in a comedy and getting to be just a devilish  bastard.  Just a prick.  I mean, he would just cackle between takes.  Well, did you say, you obviously had seen him in that other movie. 
[03:11:30]  What was that?  Some of the sharks.  Some of the sharks, yeah.  And he just plays a prick.  Yeah.  I think that's the funnest place for him.  Yeah.  You know, where I certainly like watching him most.  And we were very straightforward about that.  Like, that's the exact guy updated, you know, a couple decades and, you know, with all the  more power.  And because he was really playing his bullseye because, you know, Aniston's doing something  different than she's done.  And Colin is doing something really different than he's done. 
[03:12:00]  So, you know, having one guy that's really right in the zone, I thought was a good plan.  Colin Farrell's character is great.  Isn't he?  Just a bastard.  He's into the karate thing.  The bad comb over.  The horrible stringy comb over.  And he hadn't seen Kong when he signed on to Bosses.  So I gave him Kong.  And seeing Billy was like...  It really informed how he did his stuff.  Oh, shit.  That's great.  You know, it was like...  I could kind of see the connection now. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  And that, you know, obviously, Billy's hair is really like a remarkable work of art.  An entity unto itself.  We kind of wanted Colin's hair to be...  To want to be like Billy's, but just he doesn't have, right?  Yeah.  You know what it takes to the perfect coif.  So you're saying Colin kind of emulated him in being an ass?  A little bit.  A little bit.  I can see it now that he's...  Like just the posturing and like...  Sticking out his belly.  Being stuck in the 80s and...  No clue that he's a douche to everyone around him. 
[03:13:00]  You know what this means?  Oh.  Yeah.  What, the USA part?  That was the best.  Yeah.  You know how I would put my name up on there when I would get a high score?  Guess.  It's like, we don't want to guess.  We don't want to guess.  Three last combinations.  A computer couldn't figure that out.  No one wants to guess.  USA.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  The rest of that quote, too, is so good.  He's like, yeah, I'm not one of those 9-11 guys.  I've been patriotic for a long time. 
[03:13:30]  He's the real deal.  Oh, my God.  He's not a poser.  Yeah, exactly.  What did you do between Kong and Horrible Bosses?  I did a film with Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, Four Christmases.  I didn't see that.  That was in between.  And then a couple different docs.  I've continued to do documentary and actually try to help young filmmakers get started and  do some, too.  What's your favorite documentary you've ever seen that you didn't do?  Oh, man.  There's so many. 
[03:14:00]  I mean, I love, there's a small one I love called Hands on a Hard Body, which is about  a Nissan.  It's at a Nissan dealership every summer.  And the rules are last person with their hand on the truck.  Oh, right.  It's an old radio pitch.  It wins it.  And it's just an incredible movie about the characters who choose to do this crazy thing.  Oh, wow.  Great film.  An American movie, if you know that one.  No.  It's just a classic.  Oh, it's about two guys in, I think it's Minnesota, working on their film masterpiece. 
[03:14:30]  And they're, you know, raising money.  And it's just really good.  You like the quirky ones, the little, small.  Oh, for sure.  Like that subculture kind of a thing.  Much more so than, you know, the Michael Moore stuff.  I respect that.  Yeah.  But I love the documentaries.  I think the greatest form.  And, you know, the real stories are so compelling.  It is cool.  I find myself all the time going to, like, HBO, because they have a lot of documentaries on there. 
[03:15:00]  And I just find myself popping something on that I would never dream that I'd be interested in.  And then I'm, like, telling friends, yeah, you want to see this?  It's about, you know, this little mosquito that's brewing this.  And it came from a country that now it's ravaging this country.  That's good.  I watch horrid documentaries.  HBO documentaries are always very good.  Yeah.  Their documentary department is very respected.  They did a good one on Bobby Fischer.  Did you see that?  I'm trying to see that, actually.  Great.  I started, and I wasn't able to finish it the other day. 
[03:15:30]  But I really, that one's supposed to be great.  Do you like Bobby Fischer?  Yeah.  Me too.  As a character.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Amazing.  Yeah.  I also love the 30 for 30s.  What's that?  The ESPN series.  Oh, I haven't seen those.  Oh, they're really good.  It's just all, it's sports docs about, you know, the first 30 years of ESPN.  So it's one on, like, a Jordan one on.  Right.  It is really good.  It's hard to find, isn't it?  Like, what makes you want to do a documentary on something, like, all of a sudden, because  there's a million interesting things, but how do you go, like, goddammit, that should 
[03:16:00]  be documented?  Like, that's interesting enough.  For me, it's got to have crazy characters and an event that it's building towards, you  know, like some sort of showdown.  Oh, okay.  Whatever.  But...  Did you see Whites of West Virginia?  I've heard that's great.  That was really good.  If you like documentaries, we'll turn you on to one.  That thing is amazing.  I almost got to write that down.  That's one of the better ones.  Absolutely.  Whites of West Virginia.  I think that's the...  Is that the official name?  Yes.  Didn't they have two?  They had two.  They had a follow-up.  Well, there's the original one who...  I don't know. 
[03:16:30]  I don't know.  I need someone to help me out here.  Based on the one character, and then fast forward, like, 15 years, they did another one.  And that's the one we're talking about.  Yeah, we're just spitting out.  They're all batshit crazy.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about...  What's the one Kevin Smith recommended to us that we liked?  Oh, Catfish.  Catfish.  Oh, yeah.  You've seen that?  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  What's your take on that?  We've given people enough time.  We think that...  We think it started out as real, and then they realized they had something, and then they  kind of built around that concept. 
[03:17:00]  I think that's right.  For me, there's that one scene in the hotel room in Aspen, or wherever.  I want to admit, it's some mountain town where it all unfolds, supposedly.  That felt staged to me.  Where he had his toothbrush?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, he had his toothbrush, like, no, I'm just hanging out.  And, oh, as I'm hanging out here, look what we're discovering in front of us.  I think the end, most of the end was the real deal.  Oh, I believe the end was real.  And then when they looked at that, they probably went, damn, I wish we had documented what led 
[03:17:30]  up to this, so they did some kind of reenactment of that, documenting up to that point.  That's how it felt.  But, you know, I didn't know anything at the time when I watched that, and I found it one  of the most compelling in recent years.  I still liked it a lot.  What an odd story that is.  Yeah.  You have a great radio voice.  Eric.  Has anybody else noticed how good his fucking radio voice is?  Yes, they have.  It's the way your natural speaking voice is great.  Oh, thanks.  They have, right?  Oh, yeah.  That's like a really cool, that sounds good in headphones. 
[03:18:00]  You like that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You want him to lull you to sleep with his nice...  No, it's not boring.  No, no, I mean his nice pipes.  The minute he started talking.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, Coke Logic, who we love, he says, catfish sucks dick.  The whole thing is scripted beginning to end.  I don't think so.  Beginning to end, I don't think so.  Yeah.  Oh, and the first documentary was, thank you, Jesco White, the dancing hillbilly.  Oh, yeah.  The dancing hillbilly.  Which I haven't seen.  I think I have seen that.  Jesco White, the dancing hillbilly.  The one we're talking about is the follow-up, which is... 
[03:18:30]  White's of West Virginia.  Yes.  But I hear the Jesco White one is just as good.  Jesco.  I don't know why...  And then get back to us after you watch these films, and we'll discuss.  Yeah, we'll discuss.  Exactly.  That's what you should do when somebody says...  He's promoting a project, or do we talk about other projects?  What a terrible radio show.  He's a big-time movie maker, and we're telling him what he should see.  Yeah, exactly.  Horrible Bosses.  It's in theaters July 8th, which is...  What day is that?  Friday?  Two weeks from today.  Oh, Friday.  Okay.  At this point, you can't wait for people to see this, right?  You really can't.  Yeah, I just love watching it with a crowd. 
[03:19:00]  It is a fun one.  And they were laughing.  I think everybody can relate to that idea, right?  Everybody's had some terrible boss at some point.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes.  Fucking Donald Sutherland's in this?  Yes.  Yeah.  Fuck, I love it.  You ever see Little Murders with him?  No.  Oh, it's a fucking really weird comedy.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Elliot Gould and Vincent Gardena and him.  It's from like 73.  You're not going to be making any films in this?  Yeah, I'm going to be catching up.  You're going to have to catch up for a while.  Donald Sutherland is fucking great.  Does he play a funny role in this? 
[03:19:30]  He's great.  He's a plot.  You won't see what happened.  You won't see it coming.  Let me say that.  Does he show up on a bench and talk to Kevin Costner?  Truth's on your side, Bubba.  He's fucking tremendous, Sutherland.  No matter what he does, he's enjoyable.  He's amazing.  He's never been nominated for an Oscar.  Boring fact.  Really?  I don't know.  I felt like he really did an interview with a boring fact.  What else can we say about Horrible Bosses?  Yeah, please go see it.  Yeah, I liked it a lot.  Yeah, I'm sold.  I haven't seen it.  I'm going to go.  Jason Bateman. 
[03:20:00]  I'm sorry.  I never go to the movies.  Definitely.  I'll go, go.  I'll just give the cast.  Jason Bateman.  Jason.  How do you say his name?  Sudeikis.  Sudeikis.  Jennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Sutherland, and Charlie Day.  And I actually, I would see that.  Ron White, The Wire Guys.  Oh, fucking White.  Weeby.  Yeah.  I love Ron White.  Yeah.  He's a funny dude, man.  Yeah.  He's talking about being overweight.  He's like, the only way I'm going to see my toes is if somebody cuts them off and hands  them to me.  Like, what a fucking funny line that is.  Pat from Onaki doesn't find that funny. 
[03:20:30]  Well, yeah, because he's had one cut off.  Yes.  Roland also said your movie was better than Bridesmaids.  Oh, wow.  So, yeah.  Thanks.  And then that got a nice buzz.  I didn't see that one, so I can't really comment.  But definitely better than The Hangover.  Roland just says this.  Yeah, it's a good summer for comedy.  You know, they got it off to a great start, that movie.  Right.  Well, I'm going to say congratulations on a hit movie.  Thanks a lot.  That's what I'm saying right now.  I think you'll do just fine with this one.  All right.  Got some points on the back end?  I like just saying that. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  Got some points on the back end?  I don't even know what it means.  I have no idea what it means.  Are you rich yet?  No.  You're not rich yet?  No.  This one will do it.  Holy shit.  Let's fill out a form or something.  Yeah.  You should be rolling.  We got to make Seth Gordon rich.  Everyone go see Horrible Bosses in theaters July 8th.  All right, Seth.  Did you hear what happened today?  That was just my acting.  I was just letting you know that if you need a guy for a role, I can do it.  Nothing happens, Seth.  Nothing happens. 
[03:21:30]  Write it down.  Write it down.  That was nice.  Write down Jim Norton's name.  That's good.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  We also want to thank the couch.  Definitely.  Thanks, man.  Thanks to the couch of Zilches and, of course, the chair of honor guy.  Yes.  And I guess we're done today, right?  Chair of honor.  Oh, fuck yeah.  All right.  I got to get out of here.  Let's get out of here.  All right.  Very late.  All right.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Yeah.  This is the Obedien TV Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.
