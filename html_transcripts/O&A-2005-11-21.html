<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a conversation with a band who recounted their experiences, including a stint touring with Ozzy Osbourne in Japan, complete with tales of groupies.  The band’s performance included “Merry Fucking Christmas” and another “happy” song filled with insults.  The hosts and band members engaged in vulgar banter about their personal lives and careers, contrasting their easy jobs with the hard work of Jim Norton, whose potential appearance on a Louis C.K. show was discussed.  Dennis Leary's "Merry Fucking Christmas" Comedy Central special was heavily promoted, leading to a caller requesting the title track, which the band then played.  Discussion also touched upon Leary's *Rescue Me*, sparking debate with a caller regarding the show's portrayal of firefighters.  The musical discussion ranged from Led Zeppelin and Genesis to Gary Glitter, culminating in a bizarre dream one guest had about Roger Daltrey.  The segment was rife with profanity and sexually suggestive content, with frequent use of the word "cunt" by one host.

The show then featured Dennis Leary, who discussed his mother's tough love and his experiences with *Rescue Me*.  Opie and Anthony discussed their show's success (or lack thereof) relative to critical acclaim and Nielsen ratings.  Several callers phoned in, offering praise and anecdotes. A recurring segment involving intern Bill and a homeless woman took a central role; the hosts recounted making Bill smell the woman’s unwashed genitals, and their unsuccessful attempts to make him vomit with foul odors led to the creation of a new segment, "Make Bill Puke," with a cash prize offered for successfully inducing vomiting. Callers suggested various methods, including skunk spray and baby diapers. Other topics included their planned return to a more "cringe and edge" style, opinions of other shows and networks, and an awkward moment involving a comment about Dave Chappelle, particularly uncomfortable due to the presence of guest Bill Burr and Francine’s accidental mention of the Dave Chappelle show.  The upcoming appearance of Jimmy Norton and the “assault on the media” segments were also mentioned, along with a caller pitching a new show idea.

Next, the show delved into a discussion of the Body Worlds exhibit, detailing graphic descriptions of the plastinated human bodies on display, including a pose described as a horse "fucking a guy in the ass."  Callers shared their diverse reactions. The hosts also discussed the plastination process and the exhibit's controversial history.  This segment transitioned into a recounting of a disastrous radio show hosted by Earl Douglas for the Black Rock Coalition, playing audio clips highlighting the extreme intoxication of guests, including Opie and Anthony's own staff. The clips showcased drunken ramblings, inappropriate comments, and technical difficulties, contrasting with the intended focus on black artists. The segment included humorous interjections, such as audio clips of Martha Stewart and a bizarre clip from the Tony Danza Show featuring "sweet potato poon". A call from voice actor Billy West concluded this portion.

The Billy West interview focused on his career, particularly his experiences on the Howard Stern show, including the reasons for his departure (contract disputes). He discussed his work on *Ren & Stimpy*, *Doug*, *Futurama*, and Looney Tunes, highlighting the creative process and the contrast between the acceptance of his original character work and the lack of appreciation for impressionists.  He also discussed the differences between radio and television audiences and the challenges of salary negotiations.  A heated exchange occurred with a caller, Peter, who disapproved of the hosts' criticism of Howard Stern.  The “Assault on the Media” contest, its prizes, and snippets from other segments were also mentioned, along with an impersonation of a confrontational *Apprentice* contestant.  The segment ended with further criticism of Howard Stern's management style.

The show concluded with a discussion of Anthony's alleged purchase of "Lean on Me" cereal, followed by a series of offensive cereal jokes.  The bulk of this final segment reviewed entries for the "Assault on the Media" contest, playing audio and describing videos from opiananthony.com.  These included pranks on various news reporters, notably No Filter Paul's successful interruption of a CNN report in Times Square. Paul called in to discuss the incident and his chances of winning. The segment ended with planning for a potential weekend show featuring No Filter Paul, Big A, and Denise, outlining numerous crude and sexually suggestive planned segments.

[00:09:30]  THE END  THE END  THE END  Exactly.  Why are you saying ex-wife?  She can just cunt.  And it gets...  Yeah, I said that about the cunt once.  Come on.  Why are you saying ex-wife?  That's a...  What's the...  A prefix and a word.  It's six letters.  Go to cunt.  It's shorter.  I knew it was coming out too loud when it was still, like, at the base of my throat.  I knew the volume was up too loud, but I just had to, and it was like, you fucking cunt. 
[00:10:00]  What?  What?  What?  And she was one of those that if she heard it in a bar, she'd be like, you know, why do people have to use that?  I mean, hated the fucking word.  Now, see, here's the thing.  I grew up in an Irish household with Irish immigrant parents, and that word was everything.  Well, over there, it's used to, like, once.  Yeah, it's everything.  It's like the cunt car, the cunt weather, that stupid cunt of a priest, that...  So we grew up throwing that word around.  So I had a Polish girlfriend, Lauren, when I was, like, 18 years old.  And she, I, the second day I knew her, second hour, whatever it was, I said, eh, that fucking cunt thing. 
[00:10:30]  And she was like, did you say cunt?  And I said, I said, cunt thing fucking payphone.  That's what I, what?  The word cunt threw her off for, like, six months.  Oh, yeah.  And that's the first time I went, oh, girls don't like the word cunt.  Yeah, there's a word, I love the word.  Yeah, it's got power to it.  It's a great word, cunt.  You got the band here today.  Have you?  I do.  I have my band.  Have you guys known each other your whole lives, pretty much, or? 
[00:11:00]  20?  Almost, almost 30 years.  Jesus.  Almost 30 years.  Wow.  Same core band.  Holy shit.  For 29 years.  What do they do when you're, like, a movie star and a TV star?  They go and do their own thing, or what?  Well, Charlie played with Ozzy Osbourne.  Yeah?  Where did you play for Ozzy?  I played keyboards back at the end of the 80s with Zach Wilde and Geezer Butler and Randy  Castillo, the No Rest for the Wicked Bates.  Randy died, too.  Yeah, he's a great guy.  You watch now how Jimmy looks at you.  Jimmy's going to love you now.  You're in a whole different life. 
[00:11:30]  And Charlie was also in the Blessed Union of Souls.  Wow.  Oh, hey.  Wow, look at that.  You got a gig with Ozzy, you got a mic.  What's your last name?  Roth.  Oh, cool, man.  That's great.  Adam was in the Jim Carroll band.  Remember that band?  Oh, hell yeah.  Those are people who died.  Those are people who died.  Yeah.  Yes, I was.  And there were plenty of horror stories about that band.  We won't get into those now, I guess, right?  Well, the one thing about that band is there is no drugs.  I bet.  We rehearsed.  I was a last-minute replacement. 
[00:12:00]  We rehearsed for three days.  The first day I showed up, they didn't.  Second day they showed up, I didn't.  The third day we rehearsed, and then we went on the road for four months.  What is Carol doing nowadays?  Is he dead?  No, he's not dead.  He's around.  I haven't seen him, though.  I haven't seen him talk for years.  That's a ballsy question, if you don't know if he's dead or not.  Wow.  I just got to share, like, I couldn't have gone really bad.  Ask that question again.  How would you know?  How would you know?  What's Jim Carroll up to these days?  Probably about 20 milligrams of methadone. 
[00:12:30]  He's got his problem still.  They have great stories about that band.  That's not a problem.  Well, give us a good story.  He gets it.  Can't tell him on the air, but, man.  Why not?  Give us one story.  I can't.  It's Adam's.  It's Adam's.  It's all.  What?  You're hoping that he's going to call you soon?  No, I'm not.  Not me.  It's Adam.  Just tell the story.  Yeah, cool.  Give me a minute to mull.  I'll try to think it over.  It's satellite radio.  How long did you play with Ozzy for, dude?  Oh, he's obsessed now.  Oh, now it's over.  I'm just curious.  Jim Norton is now obsessed.  I was with him for about six months.  Now, the whole fucking Merry fucking Christmas, the special, the pushing, goes out the window. 
[00:13:00]  Jim Norton wants to talk about Ozzy for the next Wednesday.  All about Ozzy.  I had a gig for about six months.  I was really brought in as a ringer.  His regular keyboard player was going through a miserable divorce of, like, I mean, this was  like something off of Jerry Springer, what this guy was going through.  It was nice enough to stick around for three days and teach me all the parts.  Then I did America and Japan with him, and this guy had gone after Ozzy for.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  You know what?  You've got to tell the story, or Adam has to tell the story, but the two chicks in Japan  when you called them.  Oh, okay.  All right, all right.  Great story.  So here's the thing.  So we go to Japan.  All right, let me finish the end. 
[00:13:30]  Okay?  All right, okay.  You start it.  Let Adam finish.  All right, yeah.  Move over there.  All right.  Charlie's on tour with Ozzy in Japan.  In Japan.  And Ozzy keeps telling me, are you going to love his country?  And he says, wait till we get to Osaka, because Osaka, they're insane, right?  So we go to Osaka, and the way the groupies work in Japan is they're like in gangs, and  they're all wearing like designer clothing.  Like here, they're like skanks, and you know, they pass out in the parking lot.  In Japan, it's a different thing, and it's like they assign girls to guys. 
[00:14:00]  It's so out.  Somehow, I ended up with two girls in a taxi cab going out to play like video games  with the rest of the guys.  One girl wanted to do Zach.  One girl wanted to do Randy.  By the time we get to the place, they both want to do me.  And I'm trying to play this really cool, like, yeah, back in America, man, every  night, two girls.  And they go, no, not to go.  Not to go.  I go, yeah, every night, every night, two girls.  I get them back to the hotel, right?  And I guess now I should hand the mic off to my brother. 
[00:14:30]  He's screwing the two girls.  So he calls.  I got the microphone, too.  I love these guys, man.  So he calls me up.  I'm in New York.  It's like four in the morning.  He wakes me up, and he goes, hey, I'm in Japan.  I got these two girls in the hotel room.  I go, good.  And he goes, yeah, they're uckin' singing my ick prey.  I go, what?  I'm asleep anyway.  He goes, uckin' singing my ick prey.  I'm like, dude, they don't fucking understand you. 
[00:15:00]  You're not going to, if you, they find out you're calling your brother because they're  blowing you, they're not going to go, oh, we're leaving.  Don't call your brother.  Hey, Japanese insult.  You disgrace us.  Uckin' sing my ick prey.  Pig Latin.  I said, I'm e-sleep-a-pig-ing.  Did you come in their face and they say, get out, ope-slay?  Actually, the one girl, the pretty one, I kept around for a couple of days. 
[00:15:30]  It's always that story, any story with two chicks fucking you always has that.  The pretty one, at that point, the pretty one compared to whatever the other one is  could be, you know, Rosie O'Donnell.  I kept her around for a couple of days and she was like, could get a little noisy, not  that I'm any great shakes.  But in these Japanese hotel rooms, like, the walls are really paper thin.  Literally.  So on the other side of the wall, you know, where I'm banging this broad, on the other  side of the wall, that's where Geezer's sleeping.  Geezer Butler from...  He was playing this off. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, he was the bass player, but he's the ritual bass player from Sabbath.  He had the best stories, of course.  So, like, you know, it's three in the morning, you know, we're going at it, she's yelling,  and all of a sudden I hear this knock on the door, oi, oi, shut the band up!  And I realize, I'm actually keeping Geezer Butler awake, because I'm screwing this Japanese  chick.  Right now, for like the next ten seconds, I rule.  And then I get all over there.  You have to be.  I know, right.  Yeah, exactly.  Goddamn, now that's a rock and roll story. 
[00:16:30]  And what about the rest of the band?  Any other stories there?  I've seen you, like, forever.  Yeah, I'm around the circuit.  King of the voiceovers.  Hi there.  King of the voiceovers, really?  Yeah, I do a lot of voiceovers.  Any we would know?  Yeah, could be.  Let's see, I'm on a bunch of radio spots right now.  Santa Claus for an MTA spot.  That's you?  Yeah, that's me.  I'm usually non-people, non-humans, but I do a lot of Nickelodeon.  He's Grand Theft Auto.  Oh, really?  I was in the original Grand Theft Auto, various voices. 
[00:17:00]  I used to be the voice of Comedy Central.  You need to hear it.  Coming up next, The Man Show.  Followed by...  Hey, that's you.  All right.  Or the Nickelodeon thing.  There was a character called Face on Nickelodeon.  That went...  Oh, that fucking thing.  Hey.  Smoke a lot of weed.  Hey, kids love that.  No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  I can tell you're going to denigrate that fucking thing.  You know why?  And you know what?  That was great for kids.  This was before...  You fucking whore.  Don't you denigrate that.  No.  Here we go. 
[00:17:30]  What the fuck were you doing watching that?  Because this was before Nickelodeon was total kids.  At night, when it was Nick at night, you turn on and watch the Jeffersons and shit like  that.  You leave it on.  Six in the fucking morning.  Hi, kid.  What the fuck are you doing up at six o'clock in the morning?  It woke me up.  That fucking face woke me up.  The voice.  That's the job of face.  Well, you should thank him because you shut up to work on time.  Nah.  The hangover cure.  I just shut up and went back to sleep shortly to my kid-knocking job.  So I try to do a lot of things that annoy people.  Yeah, I got that. 
[00:18:00]  I do stuff for work.  Oh, I hated that one.  Tell him about the face episode where you fucked those two Japanese sisters.  It was the shit face episode.  He ends up in Japan and the next thing you know.  I'd like to just say for the public record that I think at this point,  Opie and Anthony have the easiest fucking gig in the world.  These guys aren't even wearing pants.  I thought they came here at four o'clock in the morning,  went on the air at five.  No.  What the fuck is that?  I'm so easy. 
[00:18:30]  My agent calling.  Because I'm letting the world know how easy you fucking do have it.  These guys go on the air at seven.  What time did you come here?  At six?  Six, six, fifteen.  Yeah, you fucking horse.  Do you have a meeting after the show's over to talk about tomorrow?  We are out the door by 11 o'clock.  The meeting last, the elevator ride down, then we had a meeting.  Anything?  No.  Dennis Leary's in the day.  We could get an hour out of you today.  But some newspapers are out there.  Somehow we just have to worry about three hours after that.  Yeah, we have newspapers laying around.  We have the easiest gig. 
[00:19:00]  Like we prepped for the day.  And then we'll look at the front page of the newspapers and we'll make shit up.  Really?  Yeah.  That's pretty much a day.  How do we do this?  I'm exhausted.  You know, you can't get it.  They were gone for two years because of the St. Patrick's thing.  It's a slow build.  They're going to deal with Satan and they're back.  Now they work fucking four hours a day.  It's a slow build.  You start out as a regular jock like Opie did.  He was feeling us, though, earlier, though.  He was feeling bad for us.  I felt bad.  I thought you were on the air already.  I thought you guys were on a coffee break.  I didn't realize you just came in before I did. 
[00:19:30]  He's like, what time do you guys go on?  You guys are like sitting around drinking coffee like, yeah, fucking, it's tough.  Like we're on a commercial break that lasted 20 minutes.  You fucking whores.  I saw your girlfriend.  Yeah.  What's she, like 22?  23.  What's wrong with that?  How old's your girlfriend?  26.  How old are you guys?  We're only like 30.  Well, it was definitely, I left a 40 line back a couple of years back. 
[00:20:00]  It's unbelievable.  It doesn't even have to look like anything.  I'm going to call the Catholic church and say, you should have crushed these two.  Fucking assholes.  We get that.  We're all for ourselves.  Anyways.  I love that when the UPS guy comes to the door and my girlfriend answers and the guy is like,  can I speak with your father?  I got to come to the door.  Shut up.  You know, I want to pour so much hot coffee onto your face right now.  You know, it's not even funny.  Yeah, right.  Like Leary isn't getting some choice.  Yeah, like he's had a tough life. 
[00:20:30]  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  Hang on.  Hang on.  You know, I have a great life.  Of course you do.  We're nitpicking now.  Okay?  We all have a great life.  Jim Norton has a great life.  Of course he does.  My band has a great life.  We're nitpicking.  Okay?  And I can speak for Charlie and Adam when I say that we've been with the same women for  a very long time.  And so success is like, oh, shoes.  Fucking skirts and hating you more.  You guys both have 24, 25, 26-year-old girlfriends who have no idea how fucking incredible it 
[00:21:00]  is that you guys show up here at, what, 47 and do this job for all this money?  Jim Norton does more than you fucking assholes do.  That is correct.  He does.  You guys do nothing.  Shh.  Don't blow up our spot.  We converse for four hours a day and entertain our listeners.  That's it.  And that's it.  Four hours here and that's it.  Four hours.  All right.  Maybe we've got to leave. 
[00:21:30]  Maybe another half hour during the day.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Bullshit.  Maybe.  I said maybe.  No, I walked in maybe.  Yeah, I walked in.  You weren't even talking to each other.  You were both reading the paper separately.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  We don't want to ruin the spot.  I thought you wanted to have some pressure to come up with a bit before we came on.  The fucking show doesn't start until 7 o'clock in the morning.  We knew we had you today.  You guys are going to entertain for an hour.  Fucking whores.  You guys got to like promote the Comedy Central special.  Fucking Norton's flying around doing desk shots on Louis C.K.'s fucking possible show  on HBO.  He's one of the guys. 
[00:22:00]  He's barely here.  He's working the fucking guys memorizing lines.  He flies back to do our show for a week.  I know.  He's flying back to do this fucking show.  And then he goes back to LA for two weeks.  Fucking whores.  But he's going to be a big star.  What is your girlfriend doing?  He's going to be leaving us soon.  I'm not leaving.  Yeah, you are.  I'm not.  Right now, she's in between jobs.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  Nothing.  No.  I love you guys.  It's democracy.  You know what it is?  You've got to keep watching my life.  It's why the troops are fighting.  So you two can show up at 7 and fuck around for four hours. 
[00:22:30]  Why do you want to take my happiness away?  I'm finally happy.  No, I'm not taking your happiness away.  The girlfriends have to stay on your schedule.  Because if they're going to get a regular job, they can't listen to the show's shenanigans.  And then by 11 o'clock, we're off work and they're supposed to be out until 4?  Let's be honest.  You hate these two fucking assholes.  You have to do it because it's your career.  You have to be back here.  But you fucking hate them, right?  No, not yet.  I mean, I still...  He still needs us.  He's not going to say that.  It's a growing old fucking coattail hopper over here. 
[00:23:00]  Believe me.  This son of a bitch.  When we were off for two years, it was Colin Quinn going, what the fuck's behind me?  Yeah, I know.  Jimmy Norton clinging to his French collar until that fucking thing got thrown off.  And then we're back on.  And he's like, hi, I'm back in your life.  I didn't talk to that fuck for time.  You know what?  I'm a poor kid train jumper.  I go from rooftop to rooftop.  Can we say one thing?  Yeah.  Funny prick.  Of course he didn't know that.  Funny prick.  It's a good thing for him.  What do you mean?  Good thing for you.  They have a funny prick.  The way he jumps around clinging to people's careers. 
[00:23:30]  But at least he fucking writes.  You show up at 7 o'clock with him.  He writes.  Right?  For his own act.  Dude.  He doesn't use that shit here.  He doesn't have to.  Real life is good enough when Jimmy opens his mouth.  I'm not going to dedicate him.  Because it's usually about some fucking tall guy with a wig knocking on his Saturn window.  A girl with a dick is much different than a guy with a wig.  Please.  Please.  Don't let a few bad apples spoil the bunch.  That's a big back you got there, lady. 
[00:24:00]  New hairs on it, too.  You might want to wax that.  Yeah, Jimmy's real life is better than anything you could possibly write down for this program.  Yeah, it's true.  You know, it's kind of freaky.  So what are we promoting today?  We're promoting the Dennis Leary's Merry Fucking Christmas, which is a Christmas special,  which is on Comedy Central Sunday night at 10.  November 27th.  It's the anti-Christmas special for all those people out there who love to celebrate Christmas  but hate the whole happy thing.  Oh, there's so many of those on YouTube.  And we'll get you a copy of the video so you can watch it. 
[00:24:30]  But it's really out there.  We like it.  You happy with it?  We're very happy.  We have...  You get some freedom from Comedy Central to do what you want?  We have the Peanuts Gang animated doing a special four-minute thing called...  It's your Jihad, Charlie Brown.  It's Jihad, Charlie Brown.  Charlie Brown becomes a Muslim terrorist and blows up the whole Peanuts Gang.  Oh, my God.  Finally, retributes it.  So in animation.  So it's out there. 
[00:25:00]  Lots of guest stars on it.  Wait, did they see the script before they gave you the rights for that?  Did the Schultz family approve that?  Very careful.  We're waiting for the lawsuit.  Graphics and music.  Very cool.  Oh, shit.  So we're pushing that and the single, which is Merry Fucking Christmas.  I think you guys have that, right?  Yes.  It's an EP.  Yeah.  It's out in the stores now.  It's Merry Fucking Christmas and a couple of other choice bits and stand-up and stuff.  But mostly, we're pushing the special right now. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  So.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys want to play a song or what?  Do you want to play the studio version or do you want us to sing it live?  I'd love a live version.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think we've got to go live.  You're telling us that we're not working.  Yeah.  You guys work a little bit.  You got all the fucking musicians.  All right.  We have another song we'll sing for you.  You've got the whole band plug.  We want to lip-sync to it.  I thought you might want to play the studio version of that and then we play the other  song live.  We can do that then.  You want to do that?  You're just like us. 
[00:26:00]  You don't want to work hard either.  There's another band member that we didn't introduce.  Play the studio version of that.  We have one more band member that we didn't introduce, Alec Morton over here.  Yeah.  What's he about?  You know, bass player.  I keep my mouth shut.  I'm just punching the clock.  That's what they usually do.  You know the band Raging Slab?  Raging Slab.  You can file them into a where were they then file.  Yeah.  Thanks for that Raging Slab.  Fuck you.  So play the studio version of Merry Fucking Christmas and we'll play a live version.  I don't know because then we have a lot to live up to if they hear the studio version.  No, we'll play it live or something else. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, alright.  A new song.  Well, that would be silly to play the studio version and then do it again live.  No, play the studio version.  We want to try to get like two songs out of you today.  We have two.  We have two.  Yeah, we do?  Alright.  Yeah, we do.  Because I saw you guys at Avery Fisher Hall.  I mean, the whole band, what, play two songs?  No, four.  The show is like three.  Four?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a tough gig.  Hey, we had a memorized shit-ass call.  No, we didn't.  I was sitting in the audience.  We had teleprompter.  I'm sorry.  We have the words right here, for Christ's sake. 
[00:27:00]  I was thinking, I was sitting in the audience, the Avery Fisher Hall, Dennis Leary hosted.  It was great.  All the guys that do our show were there, right?  And the band was set up and I'm thinking, wow, we're going to get a nice set from the  band.  You guys got, I was thinking, you guys got the easiest gig.  Every 20 minutes they would come out and play one song and then walk off the stage.  Wait, you guys have the easiest gig.  And then you had a guy that had to, like, place the mics on the stage.  You guys weren't even allowed to touch your own mics.  I know, not allowed.  You didn't move the mics.  Yeah.  Lincoln Center rules, yeah.  Yeah.

I take it all back  You can't  This woman came in  And just 
[00:40:30]  Stunk to high health  And  She didn't have a shower  For months  And we got her  It cost us 11 bucks  To have her take her clothes off  Spread her ass cheeks  And this guy put his nose  One inch from her ass  What guy?

Serial killer  21  He has no fucking job  No fucking house  No car  No credit cards  You're fucking using him  You guys should have  Smelt the fucking homeless ass  For the money you're getting paid 
[00:41:00]  You make this poor fucking kid do it  And scar him for life  Go pay in your dues  He must have been a pretty bad hooker  If she was homeless  Oh, really bad  They make money  It wasn't even  Hooker for her  No, it was like  It was $5 for a blowjob  She was more like  If you got a 40  Five bucks  Where is she now?  You're like  It was $5 for a blowjob  And $10 for the ass  I think  What did it smell like?  Uh, it smelled like fucking, uh, hell  Like something out of, like, a Marquis de Sade book  Jesus  Thank you, Dennis Miller 
[00:41:30]  Jesus  Scratching snippers  De Sade  You pronounced the E  Yeah  It's de Sade  Who cares?  Okay  I like Sade  I liked his, uh, rotting dumpster behind McDonald's analogy  It was a little better  Um, sorry  It was that kind of, the rancid meat thing that you said  Hey, let's go to John in Jersey  John?  Hey, morning, boys  Happy birthday, little Jeff  Oh, thanks, John  What's up, John?  Happy birthday  Hey, I just wanted to know if Leary's the one that's got  If he wants to see what that homeless hooker smelled like

Uh, no  Uh-oh  And one other thing, boys  Oh, you have the homeless headphones  What am I supposed to be doing with them?  You're washing your hands  Not holding them  Yeah  Don't wake up and be the answer  It was nothing like a home perm, huh?  That was the homeless hooker's headphones that day, yes 
[00:42:30]  And she had some kind of itchy thing  That's nice  You can take a few friends home with you  Nice  Why did you smell her?  John, I was saying, boys  Uh, yes, John  Uh, you're ripping off Howard  Hoo-hoo-hoo with the acoustics  Oh, right  Oh, yeah, we forgot about that  Yeah, there was a thing, uh, I guess Howard got on the air and said he invented  Well, he invented everything, we know that  The cotton gin  Yeah  Peanut oil  Breathing  The acoustic guitar  He actually said, this is no shit  He actually said on his show that MTV Unplugged was ripping him off 
[00:43:00]  Because no one ever had musicians come in and play acoustically on radio before him  Actually said that  Yeah, that whole folk movement  Yeah  Yeah  That grand old arm  I see  Damn  Rip off  I seem to remember a decade called  Well, we worked at WNEW, a legendary rock station here  And they have a whole room dedicated to live performances  Scott Muni would have Lennon come in 
[00:43:30]  Lennon  I love Howard, but Howard needs to get out of the house more  Yeah  You know, he's got to wake up a little bit  I think  And BCN was doing the same thing  They had a bunch of artists coming through over the years  You've got to realize  And every other rock station in America  By the way, who gives a fuck?  All right  Let's file it under who gives a fuck  It was just very funny, though, for us  Now we're going to go to Niagara Falls  Yeah  Jump!  Jump!  Hey, Mr. Harry  Yeah  Are you guys making a third season to rescue me?  Yes, we are  Of course  It's coming on the air in April 
[00:44:00]  Hey, you got a little roll for us, maybe?  No  What about  Damn it!  Yeah, we have a great roll  We show up at 7 o'clock  Don't memorize any lines  Walk through where the cameras are  Say whatever the fuck you want  And then go home  Can't we just, like, walk on a sidewalk or something?  Sure you could  Give us something  Yeah  I don't need a long background  Just walk around New York  And we'll show up with cameras and film you  Eventually  I don't want you guys to have to exert yourselves  Eventually they'll be filming  Let Norton go home and write fucking 20 minutes of new material 
[00:44:30]  And we'll show up outside your apartment  And just shoot you without you knowing about it  I'd like a part on that show  While you're fucking your 22-year-old girlfriend  Pretty ballsy killing off your kid on the show  This prick  Whose idea was that?  By the way, he's  One thing I'll say  What?  In this argument  At least he's miserable  When I see him out in public  He's kind of like, how you doing?  You're always so fucking happy  Last time I started  I was with the girlfriend  You were like, hey, it's my girlfriend  She's 22  I was like  I'm going to say how old she was  But I'm very happy  I used to be the prick  You're too happy 
[00:45:00]  I like being happy  I spent many years being miserable  I'm not miserable  Unless I'm being blown off by celebrities  When the fuck are you miserable?  Jimmy?  Like Dennis Leary  What?  I'm not miserable  Unless I'm being blown off by celebrities  Like Dennis Leary at events in Boston  When was he miserable?  I'll tell you when he was miserable  Thanks, Jimmy  Help me out  It was back in 2003  It was a Tuesday  And he actually  He looked at his bank account  And threw up  And then realized  It was mine he saw  By accident 
[00:45:30]  Thank you, Jim  Thanks for the help, Jim  Let's say hi to Dave  In Oceanside  Dave  Hey, guys  What's up?  Hey  What's up, Dave?  Hey, Dave  Did Dennis even realize  That you guys are going to go out  Like Andy Kaufman  You're just going to be  Sitting back at home  Yeah  And you're going to have  Your doppelgangers  Sitting on the air  We know it  We know it's going to happen  We're going to get  Tony Clifton to do our show  Exactly  All right, Dave  Have a good one, guys  See you later  That was awful  But it killed 30 seconds  Thanks  Let's say hi to Ryan in Florida 
[00:46:00]  Hey, good morning, Dennis, man  How are you?  Oh, great  I'm going to go out  And buy three of those CDs, man  Glad to have you back  Don't ever go politically correct, man  Yeah, that one happened  Good rally cry, sir  He actually liked that you guys  Played asshole  He thought it was great  Hockey  What do you think?  What do you think of the new rules, Dennis?  I don't like it  Why?  Because there's not enough hitting  There's not enough fighting  There's no fighting  And I'm sick and tired of seeing five on three 
[00:46:30]  With three minutes left in the game  Right  You know  But I understand they're trying to establish the rules  To a certain point  And then they'll lay off  And  I don't understand why there's not  There's no more fighting  Well, because  What was the rule change there  That is preventing people  From beating the shit out of each other  Well, the rule change is  You can't hit a guy in front of the net right now  Which leads to a lot of fighting  Yeah, of course  Okay  You can start, you know, hitting a guy  And whatever  So it'll even out, I think, as the season goes on  Right now, it's pretty boring  So  What happens if you hit a guy?  You hit a guy, you get a penalty right now  Which is not hockey  And there are a lot  It's basketball  There are a lot of five on threes 
[00:47:00]  A lot of five on threes  A lot of five on threes  So right now, it's kind of gay hockey  Are the Bruins doing well?  I don't even know  No, they suck  Thanks for asking  Okay  That's great  Rangers just beat them, right?  Rangers are doing great  You know  And the Islanders  Yeah  Yeah  And then, well  You still put the skates on, though, right?  Yep  It's amazing  Why?  Why?  I like to hit people  In hockey, you can hit them without getting, you know, arrested  So I like to hit people 
[00:47:30]  The hockey scenes between the fire department and the police department on the show are fucking hysterical  Yeah, they are  They're based in reality  When you were being nice guy  And they couldn't understand it  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  You were insulting them by not coming back  Right  Very funny show  I like to hit people  And I love that fucking TiVo, man  Because I don't know how the people that do the show, make the show, sell the show  I don't know what they feel about it  But I, every series is now a film festival to me  It's a marathon  Right  I can sit there and watch back-to-back Rescue Me from the first episode of the season to the last 
[00:48:00]  And that's it  Commercials  Bye-bye  Right  Bye-bye  What happened  What's going to happen next week?  What's going to happen in a minute?  Because that's all I got  That's the future of TV  I love it  On Demand  The DVR  24, The Sopranos  Whatever you watch  Family Guy  Whatever you watch  You know  And what?  Your new season's coming out in March, you said?  Yeah, the third season starts in April  The second season DVD comes out in March  You know, it's unique to see a show that's actually putting out a new season within a five-year period 
[00:48:30]  Isn't that fantastic?  I know  Now we've got to wait  Fucking HBO  Hey, God bless you, Jimmy  I hope it works out for you  You're going to be like 60 for season two  Yeah, I don't get that  The way they work their fucking series there  I don't get that  Now, The Sopranos takes three years off  Yeah, it's crazy  Then you get a show with Deadwood  Which we kind of get into  Instead of making new shows  Second and third seasons  They just put new shows out there to try to entertain you  Deadwood, I got caught up in that  All of a sudden  Ah, year  We'll wait  And now Rome  I got all caught up in Rome  Last night was the season finale of Rome 
[00:49:00]  And I'm hearing  That next year  It's in real time of Rome  You're going to have to actually live through a few hundred fucking years  To see what Rome's all about  Your kids will know  Your kids will tell you what happened  Pain in the ass  Fucking HBO  I know, I know  Once you knock them into shape  You've got to park in space  With your name stenciled on the fucking  I don't know  I just agree with all programming decisions we make  Of course  There's no problem with that  Faggot  So you guys going to play something from Led Zeppelin 3 or what?  Led Zeppelin 3  I was never a Led Zeppelin fan 
[00:49:30]  You didn't like Led Zeppelin?  No, I liked him  But I was not a big fan  Do you prefer Sabbath?  Nope  What was the band growing up for you?

Roundabout  Was fucking awful  Yes, very niche-y  But it had its place back in the time  You could clean your pot off of their album covers  I've never heard anybody say that  They're great album covers for a pot  I've never heard anybody say that  Who sucks?  He's the only one  Except Roger Daltrey  When he was high  And with Pete Townsend  In a bar  And Pete doesn't want it  Numerous times over the course  I had a fucking dream  That I met Roger Daltrey the other night 
[00:51:00]  We were walking down the street  That's a gay dream  No, no, no  This is really creepy  I followed him down the street  Because he wanted to fuck him  I had to go get my camera  Let's be honest  Dude, I had to go get my camera  And I came back to the place  And he was in the bathroom  Taking a shit  See?  That's my fucking dream  That is the most homoerotic dream  Those are dreams you keep to yourself  No, but it wasn't a gay thing  It was just a weird thing  No, that's a gay thing  It wasn't a gay thing  It was a scatological shit gay thing  Yeah  Well, when you put it like that  Roger Daltrey flinging shit  You hate the who  Because you want to fuck Roger Daltrey  Right  That's what we've surmised 
[00:51:30]  Yes, you want to fuck him  You don't want him fucking you  I'll get blood all over my shit  That was him taking the shit signified  The shit fucked that  The shit was your dick  If he's screwing you in the ass  You'll start going  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo  Rock opera  All of a sudden that song will make sense  Speaking of music  You hear they caught Gary Glitter, right?

Hey Danny  Hey John  I just want to talk to Dennis a minute  Yeah  I'm a New York City firefighter  And I love his work  I mean he's a great  I think everything he does is funny  He makes me laugh  He's hysterical  But I have to say that  A lot of firemen  Are upset over the portrayal 
[00:54:30]  Of them being drunks  And totally dysfunctional on the show  Just want to let you know  Yeah  No I know  No okay  Just want to let you know  Because it is a funny show  I know it's  I know it's  Well this comes up from time to time  How many times do you hear this?  Either guys love it  It's such an accurate portrayal  Or  Dude you're kind of making us look bad  Yeah  I know  That's what they say  You know  Unfortunately my  My subject matter might be  Whatever it is  But I've always been true  The best comedy  The best drama  Comes from reality  So if there's a guy 
[00:55:00]  Or two on the show  Who might be flawed  In terms of how people  You know  Watch the show  And take the characters in  You know  I'm not making this shit up  Right  And this is what makes  We're not making  Ladder 49 or backdraft here  We're making a real fire show  So the guys are flawed  But the forgiving factor  Is the fact that they go to work  Every day  And they  They love the job  And they save lives  And that's what they're about 
[00:55:30]  And you know  I mean  I don't know what to tell you  I got firefighters in my family  I have some of my best friends  One of my best friends  From the last 20 years  Is a firefighter in New York  Still working right now  You know  Nobody's perfect  That's what makes the show interesting  And I'm sorry  I'm sorry if you look in the mirror  And it  It hurts  But you know  If it wasn't for the dirt  There'd be no show  There'd be no show  Yeah that's what he wants  He wants the show  Where it's the firefighter  With the family  Who does his job  Goes home  That's not my show  That's not my show  Jeez this show sucks 
[00:56:00]  It's so boring  This guy just goes home  To his family  One of the best things  One of the best things  I can say  To solve that problem  For guys  Is a friend of mine  Whose father  Is  Was a 40 year veteran  Of the FDNY  Retired now  He had three sons  All three became  New York City firefighters  Two still work  And one died  9-11  He loves the show  And he watches it  Every week  And he loves  Every aspect of it  And he was a great  Firefighter  And he's almost  70 years old now  So if he loves the show 
[00:56:30]  I know I'm doing  The right thing  So if you have a problem  I understand  But I'm not out  To make a fake show  I'm out to make a real show  And you've got a much  Nicer portrayal of firemen  Than that Peter Braunstein  Did on Halloween  Did they catch that guy  By the love  How can they not  Have that guy  How can they not  Have him  I have no idea  He's still on the lam  As they say  Little Jewish guy  Running around  And they can't find him  He studied  David Berkowitz 
[00:57:00]  Oh did he really  Yeah  Now here's the latest  On this guy  Apparently he  Got some explosives  Off the internet  He's running around  And he's got that  In his possession  And he apparently  Has this scripted  He kind of scripted out  This whole scenario  Of the rape  And him running  From the law  That's because  He's a Jewish serial killer  And you know  We plan  We go to work  In the morning  You know  This is his pitch  Wait you're singing  Christmas songs  And you're Jewish  Nobody does Christmas 
[00:57:30]  On the Jews my friend  What the Jews  Can't do Christmas  No they can't  That's no prejudice  Two words for you  Irving Berlin  Yes  Thank you  If it wasn't for the Jews  It probably wouldn't be a Christmas  It wouldn't be a Christmas  Alright getting back to this  I'm sorry  I was just shocked  That there's a Jew  In the band  He's just running around  And they can't get him  And apparently it's scripted  Like he has scripted  The mother is now  The father is embarrassed  All hell  And he's saying  Please don't shoot him  When you get him  But get him  You know he's obviously  Got problems  The mother just spoke up 
[00:58:00]  The other day  And said  He did nothing wrong  Leave my boy alone  And stop  Stop trying to catch him  My son  Here's the thing  He's a poet  My son the rapist  I don't understand this  Because my mom  God love her  Who's you know  80 and  Irish immigrant  And a saint  But my mom  If you walked in the house  And said  We think Dennis killed 15 people  She'd go  I knew it  My mom  Would never back me up that way  I knew he was burying bodies  That son of a bitch  Where do they get these moms 
[00:58:30]  Who go  Oh my son did nothing wrong  I didn't have that  Stop chasing him  He did everything  He killed the Jews  Yeah  Same thing  I know  My mother  She put the fear in me  When I was a kid  To like stay out of jail  She goes  You can go  You know go to school  If you want to do drugs  If you want to hang out  With bad people  And do illegal things  And go to jail  Fine  She goes  Don't think I'm coming there  To get you out  And that stuck with me  Through like my teen years  I'm driving around  Maybe doing a few things  I shouldn't do  And before I really 
[00:59:00]  Went over the edge  You'd go like  That would pop back  Into my head  And go  I'm going to be  Standing there in jail  I ain't got to  Pot the piss in a window  To throw it out  And bail me out  I'd make that call  To my mother  And she'd go  No I told you  You were eight  When I told you  And I'm sticking to it  Nothing  Just believe me  They're a rot  I just can't believe  They don't got this guy yet  How did she feel  About the St. Patrick's thing  Yeah  We don't have to talk about it  That was  I knew you were  Going to get in trouble  With the church  You son of a bitch  She was more concerned  About like my job 
[00:59:30]  And whether I'd be  Moving back in with her  Or something  Like no mom  I'm fine  I had to make the call  From Opie's house  I'm like  No everything's fine  Before you read about  Shit in the news  I told her what happened  My version of it  A little  It was something  We were passing by  Some church  These assholes  Went out  Went to the church  And had sex  And nothing to do about it  But we'll be fine  We're getting jobs back  Don't worry about that  And I hung up  And just looked it up  Five years later  Yeah  I remember telling my parents  Yeah  It really wasn't ass sex 
[01:00:00]  Yeah  It wasn't ass sex  It was front to front  Vaginal intercourse  They're saying it was ass sex  But it really wasn't  Loose papers are reporting anal  We would never do that  We would never do that  Just rub a little clear stuff  On the sheets  We would never have people  Have anal sex in the church  Let's say hi to G-Man  You're not priests  Yeah exactly  G-Man on Long Island  Yeah how you doing boy  Alright  Hey man  Good morning  Good morning Dennis  Hi sweetie  Hi fella  Listen  I wanted to ask  Dennis a few questions  Regarding the new episode 
[01:00:30]  To rescue me man  I just love that show  I think it's so great  That somebody's doing something  And you know what  Give it a light  On the case of 9-11  You know  It's not all negative stuff  And you know  The newspapers  All that shit portrays it  As being horrible  But what's coming for us man  What's going on  Basically  Alright I'll help G-Man out  Any like teases  For season 3 Dennis  That's right  I don't want to give anything away  So I'll just say  It's going to be  Outrageous and insane 
[01:01:00]  Oh they haven't written anything yet  Okay  There you go  Ah we got a hit  These motherfuckers  Have to watch anything  Don't worry about it  He knows exactly  He knows exactly  That shit works  The same way as they should  He knows exactly  What we're about  Dennis knows  He's seeing himself right now  We can coast  What's amazing is  The job  Which everyone loves  Yeah  Wasn't a success technically  Well I mean  That's  Critically acclaimed  Critically acclaimed  What's funny is that  It was critically acclaimed  It had an average of 7 
[01:01:30]  Between 7 and 9 million viewers a week  Wow  Right  And that's not a hit  Now I have a hit show  That's critically acclaimed  And based on the original viewing  Per week on Tuesday night  This past season  It averages 4 or 5 million viewers  And it's a huge hit  Yeah  So it's like  That's amazing  Crazy Nielsen  You know  Network thing too  I'm glad the job got cancelled though  Because we wouldn't have done  Rescue me without the show being cancelled  Was that ABC?  That was ABC  Yeah Adam Ferrara feels the same way  Yeah  He's so happy 
[01:02:00]  He's glad it's cancelled  The job is cancelled  So that  Rescue me  Wait you don't need a little  Italian firefighter in there  Adam's going  Adam's going through a tough time right now  Someone that needs help  Carrying the hose up  I love him  He just did comics  Come home up in Boston with us  Yeah I just saw him Saturday  Funny guy  Went to a show  Funny guy  Alright let's go to Utah  John  Utah  Yeah  John from Utah  I like toast  But you guys  You guys are killing me  I was getting ready to go to bed  I've been driving all night  And I figured

[01:03:00]  That guy  We finally got a good guest on the show  We don't even promote  He complimented Dennis  But he insulted us  He put our show on  To fall asleep  Yes he did  And then when Dennis came on  He realized he had to stay awake  Thanks you fuck you hump  I hope you crash  That's our secret marketing strategy  Yeah  Watch this to fall asleep  Lee in Arizona  Lee  Hey Dennis  I just want to tell you  Great fucking show  I mean  Me and my dad  Watch it all the time  I'm a volunteer fireman  From New Jersey  We both are  My dad's been a fireman

[01:10:00]  We've got Francine in studio. 
[01:10:30]  You ready for the news, Francine?  Yeah.  Hi, Francine.  Hello, Anthony.  You don't like Anthony better than me.  What about Bill?  I said hi to Bill.  Hey, how are you?  I love your show.  The Chappelle sounds great.  Oh, a way to bring it up.  What do you mean?  If Chappelle didn't, like, decide to go away for a while, we'd still be doing that show.  Yeah, I wouldn't be hanging out doing this shit. 
[01:11:00]  It's a soft subject with him.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I really liked it, though.  I just want to say I liked it.  It's worth it.  It's worth it.  Yeah, I mean, it was just like...  It's worth it.  It's a great moment of my life, and now it's over, and I was just, you know, starting to  not, like, think about it every day.  Didn't he back tell you?  Good job.  No, he didn't tell me.  Everyone has been told around here not to mention that.  You ever heard us bring it up?  No, I haven't.  We haven't even asked Bill the question everyone asked Bill.  What's Chappelle up to?  We don't even ask, because we know it bothers him. 
[01:11:30]  And you had to just casually say that to him.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I didn't know.  I didn't know what's happening.  I still liked it, though.  It was great.  Oh, bring it up again.  There it is again.  Wow.  This is not a bit.  He doesn't want to hear that.  Okay.  All right.  I apologize to him.  I'm sorry, Bill.  A little late.  A little fucking late.  Oh, this is a little uncomfortable.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I told you to not fucking bring it up. 
[01:12:00]  They're testing you.  Oh.  Don't ever bring it up again.  Okay.  Don't even make eye contact with me for the rest of this week, okay?  Yeah.  Fucking after the floor.  What aren't you supposed to bring up as far as Bill Burgo?  From now on, so we know for next time.  Because some people are saying you're dumb.  I want them to know you're not dumb.  That you know and won't be bringing this up anymore.  Right.  I believe it's just to help them.  Jesus fucking Christ.  How many fucking times? 
[01:12:30]  I was just getting past this fucking shit.  Don't bring it up.  Un-fucking-believable.  Don't.  Okay.  And you know, finally, you do know that this is off-limits.  Okay.  But Borden never again be brought up.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we get this out of the way?  Repeat that for me, Francine.  Yep.  I, Francine. 
[01:13:00]  Hi, Francine.  Will never.  Will never.  While Bill Burr is in studio.  While Bill Burr is in studio.  Bring up the Dave Chappelle Show.  Bring up the Chappelle Show.  Oh, my God.  Get her out of here.  Oh, my God.  XM to a play.  The Opie and Anthony Show is celebrating the best bits since arriving at XM Satellite Radio in 2004.  These memorable moments shaped our year, brightened our spirits, and warmed our cockles. 
[01:13:30]  And there's nothing quite like hot cockles.  You are an ass.  There's too many men, too many people, making too many problems, and there's not a lot of blood to go around.  And to me, this is a land of confusion.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is the world we live in. 
[01:14:00]  And these are my everywhere ever.  Land of Confusion by Disturbed.  I bought the CD.  I had to.  Did you really?  How's the rest of the CD?  Very good.  Very cool.  I think they're going to stop in when they're in the New York area and do the show.  I would love for them to just plug in and just rock. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  They could play the game three inches from my face and I'd enjoy it.  I don't even want to hear the, I don't want to hear this stuff acoustically.  Let Howard have the acoustic thing.  He invented that.  I want Disturbed to plug the fuck in and just rock.  Yeah.  Rock.  I want to piss off some people.  Open up the windows, piss off the janitor across the street, and have a good old time  with Disturbed when they're in the New York area.  We'll try to make that happen.  Dennis Leary's still here.  He's in a back office.  He's in Ron Efez's office doing, like, regular radio interviews.  He's got to be having a blast with that. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy Norton back in town.  He drops the C-bomb on some of those stations by accident.  Oh, that'd be great.  Jimmy's here for two weeks.  He's doing Caroline's...  This Wednesday through Saturday.  Including Thanksgiving night?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, why not?  That's kind of cool.  That one won't sell out.  The rest of them are going to sell out, I think.  That one won't, because Thanksgiving's everyone's home.  Jimmy, I will be going Saturday.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yes, I think I'm going Saturday also.  I will need my own table for six people. 
[01:15:30]  You'll have it.  All right.  There's some tickets available, but they're going to go fast.  Well, Saturday's sold, but whatever you need, we got bled.  Saturday's sold.  Saturday's sold.  Oh.  Saturday's sold.  Would you like me to go Wednesday instead?  No, whatever you want, man.  Jimmy's one of those.  They have to open up the curtain, fill the whole place up, guys.  There's a curtain?  Ask Voss.  I've seen that show.  Voss actually didn't know there was seats behind it.  He just thought it was, like, a bunch of people, then an empty section, and then a curtain.  What's that?  Yeah, Caroline has this curtain. 
[01:16:00]  I've been there for some shows.  What's the name of the club back there?  Yeah.  And they open up the curtain for the big act, so.  Yep.  Yeah.  Very, very good.  Hey, really fast, because we were talking about it during the Dennis Leary segment, and  it was just unbelievable last week.  We're bringing a little of the cringe and the edge back into the show.  We're going to be honest.  Anthony and I, we think the show's going great.  We love being here at XM, and we felt like we needed to bring a little more of the cringe  and edge back to the show.  Well, let me tell you something else.  Some people don't understand how this works. 
[01:16:30]  I'm not saying that we need to go crazy, but.  Some of the listeners don't understand how it works.  We've heard them bitch and complain that this type of stuff isn't being done enough on the  program.  We hear you.  But you've got to wait a little.  This isn't something you come on day one and do.  We have a plan.  Again, it might look like we're just running, skipping with our shoelaces untied here, but  we've got a plan.  A year in, now you start cultivating some of that other stuff. 
[01:17:00]  How to get things in place.  Right.  How to build up what they call trust.  Right.  How to get the equipment working properly.  Get the right people in place.  And then you start.  That's what we do.  That's what we did every other job we've gotten.  We're just getting started.  It's the one year in, now we can start the show.  Ellen DeGeneres is in New York, so I guess she's going to be on the show.  Is she going to dance?  She just did, actually.  Are you kidding me?  I swear to God.  I missed it.  Yeah, you missed it.  It was a moment. 
[01:17:30]  Is she going to be coming to the studio?  No, we won't have Ellen.  Why?  Now, being on XM, Ellen is on XM.  She's on the commercial, for God's sake.  Yeah.  Must be a big part of XM.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't we then get her on this program?  Our reputation.  They're probably scared.  Our reputation as what?  As assholes.  We would have, I bet we would have a fine time.  I like DeGeneres.  I think she's a good comic.  I think she's very funny, man.  The dancing stinks, but she's a very good stand-up.  We would have to call her out on the dancing.  Yeah, stop dancing. 
[01:18:00]  Which I have heard she is tired of doing and wants to stop doing.  She tried to stop it.  And they keep pushing.  She actually tried to stop it a while back.  You know how TV people are.  You've got to do it, Ellen.  Yeah.  These fat slobs from the Midwest really need to see you dance, so you've got to keep dancing.  I love when she dances.  See, she's dancing down there in Wall Street.  Oh, no.  On Wall Street.  Why does she have to do it?  She is a brilliant, and I will use the word brilliant.  She's a brilliant lesbian.  But I'm going to throw her in that category, a brilliant female comic. 
[01:18:30]  Wow, you just brought that brilliant way down, didn't you?  Wow.  Yeah.  And, you know, she's like, that is a fantastic piece of shit.  And she's on the Today Show, you know, taking a tour of New York, and she's dancing wherever  she goes.  I mean, on the subway.  You've got to feel bad for her in a way.  She doesn't want to do that shit.  She doesn't have to.  She's Ellen has to.  She really doesn't have to do that.  She can stop it.  She's got to stop it.  She doesn't have to.  They can say, hey, would you want a date?  No, I don't.  Well, she does a fine job for Take 5, the new channel on XM. 
[01:19:00]  That channel's for ladies.  Oh, is it on already?  Is she on?  I guess.  It's the Chick channel.  There would be no reason for us to tune in.  What other dames, what other broads are on that channel?  I couldn't tell you what to show.  Well, we know Tyra is on that.  Cool.  Another one?  We have her coming in?  No.  We beat her up bad the last couple weeks, Jimmy.  Good.  She's never coming on our show.  She wore the fat suit.  We did that audio.  That I was in for.  Then she did a stuttering special.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  We love the Tyra audio.  That's our new thing.  We should have her in.  We promote her pretty good there.  Anyway, the edge is coming back to the show.  That's where I was getting at.  The eggnog drinking contest, number two, is going to be happening in the next couple of weeks.  Pat from Minaki is going to see if he can keep his title.  Very exciting.  We're starting to get some guys from all over the country that are going to drive their big rigs  to take on Pat from Minaki.  And you know that Koi magazine, by the way, that we were in?  Yeah.  The last issue, they did a really job with us. 
[01:20:00]  A one-page interview that was like nothing.  Do we have that?  Do we have a copy?  No, the actual magazine.  But I was going through the magazine, finally.  Yeah.  And they had a little piece on this guy, Crazy Legs or something like that, another competitive eater.  Not Crazy Legs.  Crazy Legs was a breakdancer.  Well, there was Crazy something.  I don't know.  Different Crazy Legs, Jimmy.  But they have a picture of him at the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.  Right next to him is a picture of Pat from Minaki.  Pat made it in?  Pat has no idea he's in a magazine. 
[01:20:30]  He's in the same issue of Koi magazine that interviewed us.  I'm a diabetic monthly.  A magazine I really don't know where you go to get it.  I have no idea.  No clue.  Not on newsstands?  Not really.  They say newsstands?  Not really.  It reminds me of a very funny shirt I have.  It says, Co-Ed Naked Volleyball.  Well, we wouldn't want to see that.  Funny, right?  Because we're playing volleyball together naked.  Like the guys-like.  Conjures up quite an image.  Sure does.  All right.  When Jimmy comes back, we like to play a couple highlights here and there. 
[01:21:00]  Not a lot.  Don't worry.  We'll do new material for you.  But Bill, the intern, smells homeless Donna's ass.  You've got to hear this.  You have to hear this.  What a moment this was.  Homeless woman brought in.  I guess she's going to be one of the lucky few homeless that join us for the homeless shopping spree.  Yes.  We take a bunch of homeless.  See, we're charitable.  We get homeless people.  The dregs of society.  They're shat upon all year long. 
[01:21:30]  And then during the holiday season, the merriest of all times of the year, we pick them up, load them into a bus, and drag them to a very posh mall.  I mean, one of these malls.  Not your normal run-of-the-mill trash mall.  We're talking...  Short Hills Mall.  Short Hills Mall.  We're talking very upper crusty stores in there and everything.  And speaking of crusty, we bring the homeless in to do some shopping for the holidays.  That's right. 
[01:22:00]  I believe we're going to give them $202 to shop with.  That's right.  Which somebody on the message board, I think, commented how hack radio that was.  That we were giving them $202 that we're hacks for doing it.  Not even getting the joke.  The whole point of it is to be like that hack.  We're giving away, you know, $102.30 kind of a thing.  To attach that type of hack radio thing to something as heinous as the homeless shopping spree is, again, the joke. 
[01:22:30]  The word is irony.  Sir.  It's irony.  It's sarcasm.  It's a little bit of...  It's something you don't get.  So, please, please, take your XM, flush it down the toilet, buy Sirius, and go fuck your mother.  If I may steal that phrase from a genius comic.  Can I say that that's not the type of talk we need on this channel, Ant?  Is that it?  You can't encourage people to do that.  Take five.  I heard Hedda Nussbaum has a new show, too. 
[01:23:00]  On Take Five?  Yes, called the Mind Your Matters program.  All right.  Where's Bill the intern?  Bill was the star of the radio show last week while Jim was being a big Hollywood star for HBO.  Hey, Bill.  Hi, fella.  Boy, that nose was all over her face, wasn't it?  Our nose.  Big black eye, curly hair.  What a wreck. 
[01:23:30]  She looks like Bozo the bad housekeeper.  Bill?  Yo.  What's going on?  You all right?  Yeah.  Are you a happy person?  Oh, yes.  You sure?  With the proper medication?  Of course he is.  Yeah, I'm always happy.  I'm good.  You like being here?  Oh, yes.  All right, we're trying to figure out how to, you know, keep you and stuff.  Wow, is he the latest on the list of...  I don't think we can pay you or anything.  Got him, got him, need him, got him, need him, need him, got him, need him.  Yeah, we're going to try to figure out how to keep you around because you're a good egg.  Oh, thanks.  You don't too happy, though.  Do you have a job?  You don't too happy.  Over the summer, I did. 
[01:24:00]  You did?  He's got a job, Ixnay on the job, A.  I just wanted to know if he, like, had something that he did previously.  No, previously I did sheet metal.  Sheet metal work?  Hey, my brother.  Yeah, on Long Island.  Oh, Long Island.  So did I.  What company did you work for?  Um, I think it was called Best Sheet Metal or something like that.  Best Temp?  It was at Amityville.  Hmm.  Yeah.  You worked with the brothers?  No, I just worked for this guy who... 
[01:24:30]  I don't...  He just paid me to work for him.  Yeah.  Were you a ductwork installer?  Yeah.  That's what I did.  Look at him working his way into radio the same way I did.  And he's doing it a little differently.  He has to smell homeless hooker ass.  I never had to do that.  I always drew a line in the sand.  You sure did, Anthony.  Homeless hooker ass.  But it's starting a new bit, and that's why I have you in the studio.  I want to see if you're game for this, because I can't read you.  I'm pretty good at reading people, and I still can't read Bill. 
[01:25:00]  We want to start a new bit called Make Bill Puke.  Okay.  Because we've noticed, like, we're making him smell horrific shit.  The Rich Voss ear thing, I watched people puke doing that.  Didn't faze him.  And I dry heaved, actually.  It was so horrific, the tumor juice that Voss has behind his ear.  Just even saying it makes me, like, a little nauseous.  And it's legendary, and people have puked smelling what's behind his ear.  And then we also had you smell Big A's breath, which was horrific. 
[01:25:30]  Patty's armpits.  Patty's smelly, hairy armpits.  He put his face in there like it was the pages of a new book.  And we think this is a good bit, because you're making someone do horrific things, but we're not getting the reaction out of them.  Have you ever puked from anything aside from drinking too much?  Not in years.  Maybe after doing Oxycontin or something.  Yeah, a little too much. 
[01:26:00]  It's always been because you put something in your body that it wasn't a reaction to something disgusting that you saw or smelled or anything like that.  Not anthetic.  That's rough.  It is rough to get someone to really vomit from just a scent.  I don't know.  A scent, a visual is hard to get them to vomit from.  The visual is harder.  Yeah, the smell.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  There are people that puke on their shoes when they see somebody get their head blown off.  You ever smell a bloated, dead cat?  Yeah.  Like, I'll be walking around.  You can just walk around and smell dead animal. 
[01:26:30]  That was in a basement?  Next to the water heater?  No, like as a kid, you go into the woods and you're...  What's that?  You get closer and it's just...  Yeah, but it's in the outdoors.  A horrid smell of dead animal.  It's in the outdoors.  Are you game for this bit?  Uh, sure.  Because people have started a thread on the message boards.  Well, as long as it's not smelling another hooker ass, uh...  Oh, that was it.  No, you can't say what you will and will not smell.  Yeah, Bill.  I mean, we won't get you like...  I don't want to just do the same thing twice.  No, see, that's kind of silly. 
[01:27:00]  But we wouldn't have you do anything like, you know, faggy or anything.  Okay, as long as...  If that's what you're worried about.  Yeah, we'll keep the fag out of it.  Are you?  No.  We'll keep the fag out of it.  How's that?  Sounds good.  All right.  All right.  Well, last week, Bill, uh...  He smelled Donna's, uh, vag.  Her unwashed, homeless vag.  That's really awful.  Jimmy's saying that's awful.  It smelled so bad.  When she took her pants off...  We said, take your pants and your panties off.  She goes, I ain't wearing no panties. 
[01:27:30]  And, uh, she wasn't.  She took her jeans off and the smell just started wafting out.  And then when she started really getting both ends, I told her it'd spread him.  Yeah, the smell that wafted around this studio.  The worst ass smell you can imagine.  Horrid.  And he got an inch away from her asshole.  That's just awful, dude.  Inhaled.  It was amazing.  With gusto.  But we didn't get the reaction we wanted.  No.  So we were kind of bummed. 
[01:28:00]  It was a great bit.  A little bit.  So now we, uh...  We're puking on our ass.  Well, now we're obsessed with seeing him puke.  Mm-hmm.  And the listeners are obsessed.  They're starting to try to figure out what will make you puke.  It'll probably be something really awful, like a photo of a happy family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here's the audio from last week.  It's a short clip, but Bill was the star.  Listen in.  Donna, what we need you to do.  See how that thing's round?  We need you to just lay over it like you were going to be taken in the air. 
[01:28:30]  I think she knows that position very well, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep your feet on the ground.  You're explaining that position to her?  Now, now, now, slide down a little, a little more.  Hawk.  Have her go back more.  Have her go back more.  Just to help along with the visual.  She's, yeah, completely naked.  Yeah.  Completely.  She had no problems with this.  Completely.  We were negotiating a price, too, before this even happened.  When she came in, I assumed it was going to be, you know, that I was going to have to 
[01:29:00]  pull out a 20, Opie pull out a 20, something like that.  She did this for $11.  $11.  And I know we could have done it for maybe $6.  Yeah, but she didn't really have to do anything.  You're making it sound like she had to do something horrific.  Whenever you get a hooker.  All she had to do was get naked.  Or a homeless person to do something.  It's always going to cost money.  Tippi Tom cost more to get him down to the gray, brown, green underwear. 
[01:29:30]  I think it's funny that she did it for $11.  Like somebody said $10.  Absolutely not.  $11.  Got it.  Got it.  Well, it was $10.  And then Opie said he'd double it.  So, $11 is doubled to $10.  In the homeless woman math.  By the way, the dollar, also, I pulled that out.  All right, but listen.  Because I do get a bad reputation on the show for being cheap.  A bad rap.  When the mics were off and no one was looking, I gave her $10. 
[01:30:00]  You did?  Swear to God.  Why?  Just because I felt like I had to.  Ah, your own guilt.  Did you mean to give her a $10 or you thought it was a buck and as she took it, you saw the extra zero and went, ah.  Didn't want to touch it again.  I can't take that back.  Yeah.  It'll crush her.  Putting that in my pocket.  It's a true story, though.  Sometimes.  True story.  Got to do things when the mics are not on.  And that's what I decided to do last week.  Pretty hurtable.  All right.  Good job.  How are we going back more?  Go back.  Go back.  Keep going.  Right there.  Right there. 
[01:30:30]  Right there.  There you go.  Now, now.  Yeah, there you are.  Holy shit.  All right.  Bill, what's the problem?  Now, Bill.  Bill Burr.  Do you see your target?  How can you miss it?  Now, he's not going to touch.  He's not going to touch you, Donna.  All right.  And you're not going to touch him.  He's just going to kind of put his face in there and give a few.  A few sniffs.  Oh, my God.  And could you spread your cheeks apart, though, Donna?  Like, spread them.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Now, hold like that.  Whoa. 
[01:31:00]  You always have to look for some reason.  You just have to look.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  Donna.  Yeah.  Once again, when was the last time you had a shower?  The shower was like months, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know, when was the last time you really took care of the back door?  I don't care about the back door.  I always do.  You always take care of it.  I always do.  Bill, does it look like she takes care of the back door?  I always take care of the back door.  Bill.  Help, you asshole. 
[01:31:30]  I'll never be letting it go back.  You asshole.  Bill.  I don't know.  Rick.  Does it look like.  Hold on.  Bill needs a mic.  Does it look like she takes care of the back door?  No.  He's saying no.  What seems to be.  Oh, God.  Damn.  But the back door looks fully operational.  Right.  Bill.  I'm still in use.  Back to the mic.  I'm a big joe ass.  Because I refuse to take a glance at that.  What is the problem back there?  Nothing really that I can see through the tears in my eyes.  But she has a lot. 
[01:32:00]  Well, you have a lot of ass sex, though, back there.  Yeah.  So it might be a little, like, stretched.  Does it look like an exploding cigar back there?  Or an exploding cigar?  No.  Okay.  I'm going to make this smell.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's get this over.  Look like Mount St. Helens.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Now, lean over like that.  Yeah.  Spread them apart.  But don't fall off.  Yeah.  Spread them cheeks.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Now, hey, could you turn your hat backwards?  Could you turn your hat backwards a little bit, Bill?  Because so the bill of your hat doesn't.  Yeah.  There you go.  And let's get that nose right real. 
[01:32:30]  As close as you can get.  Oh, my God.  Closer.  Oh, my God.  Closer.  Closer.  Closer.  Closer.  Closer.  You're almost there.  You're almost there.  We need you one inch away, Bill.  One more time.  One more time.  One inch away.  One inch away.  One inch.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Woo. 
[01:33:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  He likes that.  Wow.  All right.  Bill.  Bill.  Step up to the mic.  That's five.  Wow.  Back here.  I swear to you.  Back here.  Oh, God.  Okay.  We'll be back tomorrow with another Opie and Anthony show.  This is the worst.  Holy Jesus Christ.  It's like ass.  And there you go.  From last week.  I think it's funny. 
[01:33:30]  He said, I can smell your cunt.  I think it's funny he had to turn his hat around like Earl Weaver yelling at an umpire.  So, umpire that just ate a rotting burrito.  So, we were losing our minds just watching that and Bill did not puke.  So, now we're obsessed with making Bill puke.  Yes.  So, the bit's called Make Bill Puke.  We'll see what happens.  I don't know what we could do to top that, tell you the truth.  Well, there's people coming up with suggestions already.  John in Levittown. 
[01:34:00]  John?  Yes, hey.  Hey.  I was just thinking that maybe some lucky hunter would shoot a deer and throw the gut  pile in a box and bring that in for Bill to smell.  Let that rot a little bit.  All right.  There's an idea.  Tom?  Also, things I don't think we're going to be doing it in the studio.  We should do it, like, downstairs.  Well...  Because it's not, let's make the staff puke.  I think we should be doing it maybe in the production studio. 
[01:34:30]  Uh, no.  I have to be in there doing things I can't.  That'd be a perfect place for it.  I say we do it in the studio.  Oof.  What happened to our balls?  How about Ron and Fez's office?  There's nothing wrong with my balls.  It's the nose.  I say we do it in the studio.  How about that little room?  A lot of people are suggesting stuff.  Like, we got Tom from the Adirondacks.  Tom?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Listen, uh, one thing that will make anybody puke is the fluid that a skunk sprays at you.  Okay.  Um, it, you know, when you drive by, when you're driving... 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  How do you get that, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  Get us a jar.  I used to work, volunteer, and work with Animal Control up here, and we probably could get our hands on some.  Yeah?  Because it's a completely...  Once you get within five feet, the smell completely changed, and if you get within a foot of it, anybody will puke.  I mean, that's what they say.  Because isn't it kind of pleasant when you're driving down a country highway...  Well, that's the first time I...  And you get that light little scent of skunk.  Yeah, the first time I experienced it up close, I was like, wait, this can't be the same thing I've smelled driving through the country. 
[01:35:30]  But it is a completely horrid, horrid...  It's a smell that is meant to keep every animal in nature away from it.  Like, even shit has flies flocking to it.  And, like, other things eat logs.  Yeah.  But this is...  This makes all...  Yes, the Jim Norton.  No, that's not true.  I don't consume.  This will actually have a bear.  A hungry bear will turn around and leave.  That's a bad...  Ramone, Ramone, bring me a clothespin. 
[01:36:00]  Mike from Jersey.  Guys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I just had a baby three weeks ago.  And the baby's having digestive problems.  I had to change the formula like four times already.  Yeah.  And this baby takes fucking thumps that smell like death.  I can't believe they come out of a fucking baby.  They're, like, green and yellow and they're fucking horrid.  Babies are disgusting.  They're awful.  I'll save a fucking couple of diapers from the weekend. 
[01:36:30]  I guarantee it'll fucking...  It'll put them out.  Use diaper.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We should get a cash prize.  I'll throw $100 down.  $100 down.  Mm-hmm.  And maybe others will throw some money down.  And then the person that makes a puke gets the cash.  Maybe some of your friends in the business.  And then maybe some of...  Well, maybe some of the friends of the radio show will just keep adding to the pot until Bill finally pukes.  I'll start it.  I'll throw $100 in.  Sure.  Throw $100 in the hat, okay?  I'd do anything to see him puke. 
[01:37:00]  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  You have to have it in a cooler.  Yeah.  You drive up to the station, knock on the door and say, hey, I want to try to make Bill puke.  And then we'll send Ben or Steve or somebody down there to see what you got.  And then we'll bring the cooler up to the studio.  Or maybe do it on the sidewalk.  We'll figure all that out.  If we're going to do in-studio stuff, I'm going to procure a gas mask.  Well, we're working on your plastic bubble.  That I can strap on.  We're working on your plastic bubble already.  My plastic bubble?  Yeah.  Almost ready? 
[01:37:30]  Or we could get you the bad boy Bubby gas mask.  No, that didn't work.  It was just a hose.  I want some old World War II fucking...  You know what might get you?  How about you scrape a fingernail on Big A's tongue on the back?  The breath is bad enough.  I'm not saying, but scrape the tongue, your fingernail, on the back of the tongue and sniff  like the little white stuff that comes on.  I was out at a bar.  It was a party for Paul, no filter Paul's wife.  Her birthday.  Denise. 
[01:38:00]  Where was it?  In Washington Heights?  It was downtown.  So, we were at this bar and Big A was there.  And what this bartender did to Big A, it's one of those where the chick bartender's real  hot and they dance on the bar and do all that shit and do hula hoops on the top of the  bar and stomp around.  Yeah, that's Big A.  After this friggin...  You hit brightness again.  You tool.  This...  Now he turned the monitor off. 
[01:38:30]  You are the worst.  She took his shirt off, took a belt, put it around his neck and then started whipping  his back and then put a shot in her mouth and spit it into his mouth.  And he was in heaven.  I would be too.  Just in heaven.  And we...  I was horrified that the bartender did this to Big A because she was putting her mouth  pretty much on his mouth.  What? 
[01:39:00]  She didn't know.  You look at him.  She had alcohol in her mouth.  You just got to look at him and know.  He's cute.  What a mess.  He's a big fella.  And then Patty gets up on the bar and starts dancing.  Everyone's chanting Patty, Patty.  And she's up there doing this horrible Demori Povich robot dance.  And there's just this hottest chick with the fucking thong coming out of the back of her  jeans dancing on the bar.  What bar is this?  Sounds like a great night.  Yeah.  It was a scream.  Oh, it was a panic. 
[01:39:30]  A panic.  Are we done with Bill?  Bill, just leave it.  You put a few beers in you.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Yeah, good.  Well, happy birthday to Denise.  All right.  So are we going to make this happen?  Make Bill puke?  Yeah, sure.  I'm done.  All right.  There may be some money in it for you, too.  We'll figure out the whole concept off air.  I think it's impossible.  You think it's impossible?  Yeah, I would bet against it.  Well, someone is suggesting we call Joe Rogan up and get some of that shit from Fear Factor.  Well, then you're talking he'd have to consume that shit.  Because that's when they start puking. 
[01:40:00]  The smell that comes off some of that crap, man.  Remember the smell from the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Yeah.  I didn't puke.  No one puked.  And believe me, shit gets me disgusted like that.  Yeah, we had stuff on our nose.  Oh, but that didn't do anything.  Smell, it's very hard, I think.  If you're consuming the smelly shit, now you've got an issue.  If you're just smelling it, I'm betting against it.  I don't think he'll puke.  I'm definitely interested to see where this will go.  All right.  Well, the pot has started.  I got $100 in.  And you got $100 in? 
[01:40:30]  Of course.  So we got $200 in the pot so far.  And as other friends of the show come by to say hi, they'll donate a little money.  And basically just show up with whatever it is in a cooler.  If it's not in a cooler, forget it.  Just get a cheap cooler.  Let's say hi to Mike in Kentucky.  Mike?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, how about having him smell the chum from the eggnog contest?  That's not a bad idea.  The eggnog drinking contest is coming soon.  After the people puke into the bucket, he's got to smell that? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Sometimes maybe with puke being involved, that might...  Well, everyone is calling with suggestions.  Look, just show up with what you got in the cooler and we'll go from there, okay?  Make Bill puke.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony program.  Thanks, Bill.  We should take another break.  Before we do, can I answer one question that I've been getting a lot of emails on?  Ooh.  It's just a MySpace question.  There's a few Jim Norton sites, which I'm honored, but the one that's mine is myspace.com slash Jim Norton. 
[01:41:30]  That one is mine.  I get a lot of, is that you?  It's me.  Why?  People thought other sites were you?  There's a couple other ones, apparently, and I had an old one, which I don't use anymore, but that one's mine.  Not a big deal, but people ask me, so I tell.  How many people have been killed from MySpace so far?  Any pedophiles luring away small children?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm sure.  You know that Match.com is in trouble?  Why?  Because to keep the site going, they had some ringers, some chicks, some hot chicks that were going on dates.  Are you kidding? Stuff in the ballot box kind of thing? 
[01:42:00]  Can you get the story?  It was over the weekend or something.  That is what a great idea.  Because Match.com, a lot of people are using it now.  You know, this online dating thing is really, really taking off, and supposedly Match.com had some ringers in there that were going out on some dates.  So you get these guys, and they say, uh, lonely.  Well, it's great advertising, because then you're telling your friends, like, look what I went out on a date.  Dude, this hottest chick came over.  And then all of a sudden, they're signing up for Match.com.  I've got to get the whole story before I say something wrong.  Dude, I went out with her, and she never called me again. 
[01:42:30]  I don't know what happened.  It was great.  We were in love, and she wouldn't kiss me, and she left.  And Alt.com, I think, stinks.  That's like one of those alternative lifestyle things, like for BDSM, all that type of shit, like the perverted chicks are supposed to be there.  I've never gotten a response from anybody the times I've sent.  That site stinks.  Lying sacks of shit?  Yes, and I think that all the pics of the hot chicks are ringers, like he's saying.  All from Match.com.  Well, this whole Match.com is taking off.  We just Googled it over here, and a lot of stories popping up for today. 
[01:43:00]  Is this a quick version?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Match.com accused of faking romance.  Match.com has been sued by a man who says the online dating agency wrote him romantic emails and even sent him on a sham date with an attractive employee to encourage him to renew his subscription, according to Reuters.  California resident Matthew Evans filed the suit in the Los Angeles District Court, blah, blah, blah, and believes the actions represent a pattern of behavior by the U.S. company.  His lawsuit is seeking class action status.  Match.com denied that the firm pays staff to go on dates with subscribers or send them bogus emails. 
[01:43:30]  In a separate lawsuit, Yahoo is accused of posting fictitious profiles of singles to its rival dating service.  Why don't these people fucking sue their parents for not instilling real self-esteem into them?  How do you not think that those are ringers, you dummies?  How do you not?  When you see these gorgeous chicks, how do you not know that?  Yeah, they're on Match.com.  This guy's asking them out all the time.  Yeah.  But they're on Match, and you're the perfect match. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, Chris from Kentucky.  Yeah, what's going on, gentlemen?  What's up, Chris?  Uh, I hope you said something the other day, you know, right before Black Earl's radio show,  said you wanted to give Mike the Pest a radio show if you had an idea.  Yeah, we're going to give the Pest, because they've done such a great job promoting this radio show.  We're going to give them some time on the weekends.  We just haven't figured out how to do it yet.  No, I'm just, I just want to throw my hat in the ring, man.  I would love to do that.  Well, come up with a concept, and we'll go with it.  Actually, we're looking for a show that we can throw on this Saturday at midnight. 
[01:44:30]  I've got one.  I mean, I've got an idea written up already.  What is it?  I've got me and a buddy, well, two friends, actually.  You know, me and my friend Ben doing the show, like, and then my friend Ariel,  who is a Southern Kentucky-raised half-Jewish, which ought to be enough right there.  And, you know, we kind of want to do something, you know, based on your program,  I mean, we've got a good rapport.  You know, we've got good chemistry going.  And, you know, we kind of, you know, based on your show, you know,  with a free-flowing conversation, hitting all the angles, different subjects, 
[01:45:00]  but from, you know, a different point of view.  Is the show going to be called Never Get to the Point Guy?  Can I, sir, sir, not to derail your little train, I'm 37.  That's the worst explanation of anything I've ever heard.  Of anything.  Yeah, you've got to explain it.  Yeah, pitch it.  Is it like Mythbusters meets Jackass?  It's a three-way oxymoron.  What do we put on the...  Liberal, logical, hillbillies. 
[01:45:30]  I've been doing so well with that.  What do we put on the side of the bus?  It's like Melatonin meets Ambien.  Liberal, logical, hillbillies.  All right, listen.  We're going to give you another hour.  Call back.  We're not going to blow you off.  But you've got to, like, summarize and get it to a point where we're going to be interested.  All right, 10-4.  All right.  10-4.  I like that.  Well, he'll call back.  He can talk in CB talk the whole time.  He'll call back in an hour, and we'll hopefully figure that out.  But we gave Earl two hours on Saturday night to do his Black Rock Coalition. 
[01:46:00]  We got some audio.  We could do that next.  We also have, God, three or four assaults on the media that went down over the weekend.  Oh, yeah.  I saw a couple of those.  Very funny.  Holy crap.  No Filter Paul is just a huge star for this radio show.  A huge star.  He's in the background of one of them just getting in a little shouting match with somebody after  he gets dragged out of the frame by his collar.  Yeah.  Well, the videos are up on opianthony.com.  They have behind-the-scenes footage that Big A, I guess, shot. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  And it's great, because you get to see the assault on the media that went on, that everyone  saw on TV, and then the video spins, and then it goes to the behind-the-scenes footage.  That's great.  These guys are getting better and better with the stuff they're coming up with for the show  and sending it in to Steve.  Paul is actually, he's just an animal.  You're welcome.  And he just does a good job for the show.  You're welcome.  All right.  Very good.  And he runs wowfans.com.  He's a good boy.  All right, Derek.  Get us out of here.  We'll play the audio from the latest assaults on the media. 
[01:47:00]  Anthony.  That's the problem, though.  You don't know what he's saying, because of that stupid accent of his.  Yeah.  Ophany and Anthony.  What?  Opie and Anthony.  Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What?  What?  What?  What?  But check out the videos, and we'll continue in a bit there.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Opie and Anthony.  So sit back.  Relax.  Have yourself some herbal tea.  Close your eyes.  And drift away with O&A.  Big-ass cock. 
[01:47:30]  Hi.  This is great.  Ah!  You dick.  No, no, no.  Bye, aye, aye.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The holiday season is a special time for family, love, togetherness, giving, and puking out your nose. 
[01:48:00]  It's the second annual Eggnog Challenge.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Last year, Pat Ramunaki drank 70 double shots of Eggnog to become reigning Eggnog champion.  Will he be dethroned by one of you thirsty psychopaths?  Stay tuned.  It's all coming up on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:48:30]  Let's go to Wisconsin.  Blake, what's going on today?  How are you doing, guys?  All right, Blake.  Well, I heard the show Saturday night.  I actually didn't think it was that bad, Earl.  I didn't think Earl was that bad Saturday night.  The music concept, I didn't think he did that bad of a job.  You're talking about the Black Rock Coalition with Black Earl Douglas.  Exactly what I'm talking about.  The executive producer of the Ron and Fez Show.  Right.  His dream came true, and he did a national music show for everybody. 
[01:49:00]  His idea, the Black Rock Coalition.  Right.  All right, we have some audio.  We want to listen to it a little bit.  Okay, touch it up.  All right, thanks, Blake.  But it's starting a new thing.  We want to, like, start jazzing up the weekends with some crap.  So if you've got a show idea, you may get a couple hours on this fine channel on XM, okay?  Right.  You want to listen to some of this audio, Ant?  Yeah, I want to see what he did.  I didn't get to listen.  I was too busy looking at Dead Bodies on Saturday, so I didn't get to tune in to Black Rock Coalition. 
[01:49:30]  Have you heard about this Body Works yet?  Yes.  Oh, my.  I haven't seen it.  Or Body Worlds, I guess it's called.  Body Worlds.  Dead Body Art.  Oh, the website is ridiculous, but it's www.fi.edu slash bodyworlds.  And I think they got some examples on the website.  Yeah.  Can you pop that up there real fast?  Ugh.  And they're also showing this in New York at the South Street Seaport. 
[01:50:00]  Oh.  But basically, it's real dead bodies in all sorts of poses.  They rip the skin off the bodies, and then you get to see the muscles and the organs.  You don't remember?  Dot edu.  Dot edu.  It's the edu part.  Why are you yelling at me?  Slash bodyworks.  Body Worlds.  That's what I meant.  I forget.  I'm so used to eatabullet.com.  I don't know nothing else. 
[01:50:30]  The plug.  Oh, there you go.  I'm at the gallery.  We'll go to the gallery.  Yeah, go to the gallery right away.  This one's doing karate.  I like that one.  That's wonderful.  Well, and that's the weird thing.  They have this process where...  Tastes like chicken.  They take the smell out, and they take the fluids out of the body.  It's a process called plastination.  Some creepy German-like scientist came up with this.  Of course, he did.  Back in the 40s.  1977. 
[01:51:00]  They're passed on from relatives from the 40s.  Yes.  Where's the gallery?  It's called Preserve a Jew.  Go to the gallery.  From a Dr. Mengele.  We just came up with it.  Go down.  What an awful group.  All right.  I can't get to the gallery, but this was at a museum in Philadelphia over the weekend.  We went for a couple hours, and it was absolutely amazing.  When did it in New York?  Now, they got some of these bodies down at the South Street Seaport, I believe, because  I was reading an article in the New York Papers about it. 
[01:51:30]  It's a filleted head.  That's nice.  It's just very artistic.  Creepy, artistic, very interesting.  You get to see the muscles and the organs, and I don't know.  They show you healthy lungs and cancer lungs and all that stuff, but mostly they got these  bodies pretty much intact, except that it's missing the skin, so you get a real look at  what the body's all about.  Is that head and face real?  Yeah, it's real. 
[01:52:00]  Look at that.  Got a good chin.  It's absolutely real.  Too bad they don't have some good pictures on the website.  I'm noticing they don't have much there.  But then they pull back the skin and stuff, and then you see the spinal cord and see what  that's all about, and then they dissect them in some ways.  They put the bodies in some crazy poses, like they had a basketball player.  And you could donate your body for this thing.  They had, on the wall, as you're going through the exhibit, they have a number and an email 
[01:52:30]  address and how to contact them, so you could write all the paperwork, and when you die,  they could do something crazy with your body like this.  You could see the world.  And they had an archer.  A lady has an archer.  It was unbelievable.  Did you see her vag?  Oh, yeah.  They had vages and nutsacks.  What the hell was penises on everybody?  What does the vag look like with no skin on it?  It, uh, exactly the same.  Kind of very similar, man. 
[01:53:00]  It was just a swallowing hole, fear-inducing.  It was pretty similar, actually.  Yeah.  What was really disturbing on the guy models, whatever you want to call these things, the  guy exhibits, your bullies, they hang from, like, strings.  Who knew?  So they had the bullies hanging from strings on these dead bodies.  Click-clacks.  Kind of like click-clacks.  Yeah.  And then, it was really interesting, but there was one, um, one exhibit that really got to 
[01:53:30]  me.  It was a mom.  She was eight months pregnant.  She was on her side.  The skin was completely removed, and they cut her belly open so you could see the baby.  Oh, nice.  Head first, ready to come out of the vag, getting ready, you know, eight months into the pregnancy.  And then you're sitting there like, wow, this lady obviously had to die to be in this  position.  And then that's, that one, you know, got me all creeped out.  Did they have a motorboat ten feet over her?  That's a good display. 
[01:54:00]  Let's go to Ryan in Ohio.  Ryan, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Um, I think that, that exhibit was in, uh, Cleveland a few months ago, and I think that's  the second one that's touring the country.  Okay.  The first one, um, that was in Europe a few years ago, it was real controversial because  he came up with this plastination or whatever it's called.  Yeah.  And, um, nobody knows where he got the bodies from. 
[01:54:30]  So, it was real controversial.  A lot of people didn't want it coming, did not want it to come to the United States.  And, uh, and it's controversial because you were just talking about the mom and the babies  and whatever, because nobody knew where the original one, uh, came from.  Yeah.  It was, it was, uh, it was kind of creepy.  It was unbelievable.  The line to get into this museum down in Philly, the Franklin Institute Science Museum, it was,  it was crazy.  It was just crazy.  How long did you have to wait?  Uh, about an hour.  And then you got in and we walked around for like an hour and a half. 
[01:55:00]  You know, they show, they show, uh, embryos like after like a couple of weeks, four weeks,  six weeks, eight weeks.  And it was crazy.  Like after five or six weeks, uh, you know, it's like the size of a, like a lima bean.  Dr. Gunther Von Hagens.  Yeah, that's the guy.  Yeah.  That's the guy.  Jeez.  That just sounds evil.  That's the guy.  And then the, uh, the grand finale, there was two in the last room.  They had a guy holding his own skin, the body, obviously a dead body standing there. 
[01:55:30]  They removed all his skin to show you how heavy and how much of it you have.  And it, and then had it draped over one of his arms that was extended.  Really creepy shit.  So it's muscle guy, like just muscle and, and bone and ligament and tendon guy holding  his own skin.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  I thought I'd get sick or something, but in a weird way, it was very artistic too, how  they, uh, how they display these bodies, you know?  And then the grand finale, they had a horse that they did this process to. 
[01:56:00]  And it was fucking a guy in the ass.  I heard about the very controversial, uh, they had, uh, a horse that went through the  same, uh, procedure with a guy on top of the horse riding the horse.  And he was like, no skin, just bones and muscles and, and some of his organs, uh, you  know, exposed.  That was pretty cool.  I was able to see that.  It was unbelievable.  Fuck you and the horse you rode in on display.  It was unbelievable.  You see that one?  So what they do is, uh, suck out all the, um, the juices in a vacuum. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  And then, and then, uh, uh, put acetone in and that like, I guess, um, uh, clears out  all the fluid.  Then they suck the acetone out and inject in this polymer.  Yeah.  That gets into every single cell.  Yeah.  So bacteria can't get to any of it.  But they don't do that until they, it's like plastic.  They don't do that until they pose the body in a position they want to stay in.  Yeah, because it's going to be, uh, uh, hardened.  It was kind of creepy because you had archer lady. 
[01:57:00]  She, like, had a, you know, an archer's bow or whatever.  Yeah.  And in the position.  But she's dead and has no skin.  And, and a lot of these bodies, they, they take the brain out and, and pop it up on the  skull.  Like, it was a little up, uh, off the head.  Oh, it was bizarre.  Some of the things they did.  Was, uh, was, uh, archer lady all muscle?  Yeah.  What did her tits look like?  That was really creepy because, like, uh, the skin was removed except for, like, the nipple.  Like, the nipple was still intact.  Get the fuck out of here.  It was bizarre, man.  So what, what, what, what was behind the nipple? 
[01:57:30]  Uh, you can't see because the nipple was still there.  Just, discolored.  Like, now a yellowish color.  Yellowish tan color.  Yeah, but, like, was it just muscle?  Yeah.  And then a nipple?  Yeah, breast muscle.  And then a nipple.  Did you see, like, uh, bulbous tits or was it just, like, a guy chest?  No, no, no.  No, pretty much you could tell it was a woman, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It was really creepy but very fascinating at the same time.  Perfect mannequins for a store.  When was a store going to finally have the balls? 
[01:58:00]  Can you imagine?  I'd shop there.  Can you imagine?  And some of the, some of, like, the, uh, the bodies had their own brain in their hand.  You know, the way they displayed this stuff was just like, you know, it was like an art project.  It was more art than science is what I was thinking.  But they're trying to say it's a science thing so they could get this, uh, thing into these cities, you know.  But a lot of controversy over the exhibit.  That's great.  Let's go to Adam in Michigan.  Adam?  Uh, yeah.  I saw this thing a couple months ago in Cleveland.  And, uh, it didn't take me an hour to get in there because Cleveland sucks and nobody wants to go there. 
[01:58:30]  But, um, it reminded me, if you've seen the movie Saw.  Okay.  It reminded me of some sick, twisted art thing that this guy just had out to, I don't know, prove that he could do this.  And it was just raw, nasty, nasty.  Hmm.  Yeah.  It was bizarre because then they had the year of the bodies, when they got these bodies, I guess.  Yeah.  And one said 2005.  I'm like, man, that is like someone that died relatively recently.  You've got to think within the last year.  Yeah.  And there's a guy sliced, like, wafer thin or something. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah, I've got to explain that one.  So then they had an older guy.  Thanks, sir.  Yep.  They had an older guy.  Uh, he still had his skin on him.  I think he was one of the only ones that had all of his skin on him.  And then he was sliced from head to toe, uh, like, um, trying to think.  Like, I think it was five cuts, five cuts.  So the first cut was just past the eyes and the nose.  So you see the face all the way down and his junk and his chest.  And then there was another slice, you know, deeper, deeper.  And then the last slice, obviously you could see his, uh, his back, his ass and all that shit. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  And he, and he's sitting, well, he's standing there with all the slices right in a row.  One, two, three, four, five.  And they separated them by a few inches or just a few inches.  Yeah.  So you could kind of get a peek at, wow, look at the heart, you know, cut in half or whatever.  And this and that.  But what creeped me out about that one, which made it way too human for me, was the older  guy had tattoos on his body.  Oh, yeah.  He had a tattoo of a, like, a really nice, uh, woman's face on his forearm. 
[02:00:00]  And you're sitting there like, man, this is, this guy is now on display in a museum.  But there was a time he would really thought about that tattoo and what he wanted on his  forearm, you know?  Yeah.  And then he had other tattoos on his, uh, shoulder and stuff.  And that's what made it a little creepy for me.  Like, oh my God.  His hair was still intact on his skull.  That is, uh, creepy.  It even sliced up like that.  It was still neater than Ben's.  Let's go to Cindy in New Jersey.  Cindy!  Hi.  Hi.  Hi!  Hi!  Um, you eppers. 
[02:00:30]  Um, I was there in London for the protest when this was back in 2002.  And it was hardcore over there.  Like, they were so freaked out by it.  But the lines were like three hours long.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was great, though.  I mean, but the weird thing was, it wasn't really about religious, I thought there'd be  a lot more religious protesters out there, but it wasn't.  It was just because it was so grotesque.  It was awesome.  But the one on the horse was amazing for me.  It was absolutely amazing. 
[02:01:00]  Because the horse completely skinned and some of the organs removed.  But you could kind of see what, you know.  Go ahead.  Did you see the guy that was like his best friend?  No.  What was that?  Um, I'm not sure exactly which one it was, but he actually did his best friend.  I don't know if it's still in the world.  Oh, how do you do that?  I don't know.  It was on Discovery, too.  There's a show about it where they did a whole entire thing.  Dude, this guy's a weirdo.  This guy did his best friend.  And he said it was the most, like, therapeutic, artistic way to grieve his loss. 
[02:01:30]  It was amazing.  Yeah, that's what it is.  This exhibit was so hot in Philly, you walk through the gift shop.  They have a gift shop afterwards that has something to do with the exhibit.  And there's a video.  I'm like, fuck.  No brainer.  Give me the video.  Sold out.  They can't make the videos fast enough.  Because they actually show...  Hold on, hold on.  God damn it.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  No, that's right.  Go ahead, Cindy.  Forget it.  I love you, Jimmy.  I love you.  Go ahead.  Opie's trying to say something.  Hold on a second, Cindy. 
[02:02:00]  Stop breathing heavily.  Cindy.  So you liked it, Cindy?  Yeah, I loved it.  And I love you guys, too.  All right.  Thank you, Cindy.  Thank you.  Opie, keep her on.  You say something now.  What I was going to say is that in this video, they actually show you how they do it.  Yeah.  They take you through.  I saw some clips of the video, and they have the dead bodies in the body bag still.  And then they take them out, and they got them on the gurney.  And they start slicing and dicing.  They should have the interviews with some of the people that gave their permission first.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  Before they die.  Well, that's what I'd love to know.  And then after they die, then show them running them through the process so you could actually  see the person alive.  Well, like Archer Lady, I want to know what her story was in life.  You know?  But they make sure you don't know her name, when she died, what were the circumstances  of her death.  Nothing.  Nothing.  And some of these people, like basketball guys, he was a very healthy-looking guy.  You wonder, holy shit, how did this guy die?  It could have been an accident.  Yeah.  And now he's part of this thing.  They had a runner in a running position, right?  Mm-hmm.  Looked like a typical runner's body. 
[02:03:00]  And then they took the muscles, and they cut them, and made them go horizontal to show  motion.  Oh, so it looked like he had a kind of like zoom.  Yeah, yeah.  Something coming off the back of him.  Yeah.  Like zoom.  Yeah, like that old commercial for the tape.  Yeah.  What the hell was that?  Maxell.  Maxell or whatever, with the guy's hair flowing.  Yeah.  But it was like that, with all his muscles flowing toward the back, like he was in the  middle of running.  So they took the muscles, cut, and went horizontal with a bunch of them. 
[02:03:30]  Pretty twisted.  The one I want to see, though, I heard there's a really cool one, like a really skinny one  with a robot in front of an architecture desk.  No names, though.  No, no names.  And then MB, just engraved somewhere.  They had full bodies, but then they had almost every body part in glass cases, like a healthy  stomach and all that.  Really?  Just beyond creepy.  Let's say hi to Steve in California.  Steve.  What's up, bro?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey.  Did you see that vein thing, where they took all the veins out, and they just had the body 
[02:04:00]  standing there with just the veins, nothing else?  Yeah, I can't even really explain that.  They had the veins and the capillaries, Anthony.  Yeah.  And they have a process.  They had it for a baby, and the capillaries and the veins and all took the shape of the  baby, but that's all they had, were the capillaries and the veins and stuff.  Yeah, that's how it is inside you.  And the nerve endings, I guess, and all that.  How many bodies are there?  I don't know how the fuck they figured that one out, because it was in the perfect shape  of the hand and whatnot. 
[02:04:30]  Huh.  About 20 bodies, maybe, or more?  There was, God, at least 20, probably, yeah.  It was just one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.  They'd probably leave it in the hand, the veins, and then suck the juice out of just the veins,  harden up just the veins, and then they could just peel away all the rest of the crap, and  then you'd have the...  Because that was amazing.  I'm guessing, but I would assume you would need it.  I don't think you'd be able to take soft, pliable veins, pull them out of a hand, and  then harden them up and mold them back the way they're supposed to be. 
[02:05:00]  That'd be rough.  And I try it, though, when I get home.  There was about 10 of us that went, and I freaked everyone out, because I'm like, wow,  oh, man.  Started making out with one of the...  Yeah, I didn't want to touch them, but all of a sudden, I look at the group of people  I'm with, and I go, man, you know, my dad donated his body to science.  I hope he's not in here somewhere.  Oh, man.  And then they all just, like, their faces just drop, like, uh, uncomfortable moment  for everybody, uh, and I'm like, ah, just kidding, and then everyone, like, breathed 
[02:05:30]  a sigh of relief, like, oh.  That's like that Planet of the Apes moment, where Taylor's running around the museum of  natural history, and his buddy is in one of the displays, all stuffed, and the black  guy's out there, and he gets shot.  Uh, it was the Daily News yesterday here in New York, New York Daily News, Sunday edition.  They have the same display at the, uh, South Street Seaport, and they got much better examples  than, uh, the website. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, they don't?  Well, look at this.  Explain this to the people, Anthony, before we move on.  There's a basketball player.  That's a different basketball player, by the way.  And look at this guy with his brain completely exposed.  They kept the brain in the skull, but just cut the whole skull apart.  Oh, he looks like a monkey.  They cut the skull apart right above, I guess, the eyebrow, so his eyes are intact.  His nose is intact, his lips are intact, and that's it for the skin on his face, pretty  much.  And then his brain is completely exposed from above, and they put him in, like, kind of  a thinking pose.  Yeah, he's like in the pose of the thinker. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Like every hack comic headshot.  Yeah.  Little hand on the chin.  I think this, um, I think this exhibit is gonna just explode now, man.  Like, I guess it did start in Europe, and, uh, Philly is really doing a big, uh, a big thing  with this, and some of the bodies are down at the South Street Seaport.  I think this is just gonna be massive.  Can I see it, Tweetie?  Absolutely massive.  It's disgusting, but after you get through, uh, past the initial shock of what you're  seeing, it's really, really interesting.  I'd love to walk through.  Wouldn't it be great to have somebody walk through it with a recorder and just laugh 
[02:07:00]  at every display and point and spoil it for everyone?  Just really laugh loudly?  Like, like, De Niro?  Can't fear?  Everyone was taking a, everyone was taking a peek at the back doors of these exhibits.  Really?  The anus?  The anus?  Because they had everything gone, but the anus tube.  The sphincter muscle?  It was just kinda, it was, and a couple of them still had little hair.  Ew.  Are you kidding me?  It was just outrageous.  So, without, like, your butthawks, like, the, um, the fat and the skin? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, because they, yeah, because then they, uh, for some of these bodies, they, they did  different things for each body, so in that case, they actually took all the muscle and  everything away, so you see the, yeah, the anus and the tube or whatever, without the  muscle around it, so it's...  Get a picture of you sucking on it.  Taking a hit.  Humming dynamo, won't you blow your horn?  Pete from Miami.  Hey, yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, Pete.  My sister saw this, and she said it was crazy, with her teenage son, and they loved it, but 
[02:08:00]  you ever stop to think about the families of these people?  Do they go visit them in the museums, or do they know they're there?  What's up with that?  I want to know all that now.  I would love to get this guy on the phone and talk about it further.  This crazy German scientist or doctor.  He probably can't come to the phone.  He's actually looking at the videos on the, on the front page of the PETA website and just  jerking off.  It's pretty bizarre.  I saw pictures.  It looks like from Hellraiser, when a guy's got no skin.  That's what it looks like.  You see how the muscle is. 
[02:08:30]  It's really bizarre.  Yeah, it's a trip.  And then you see hearts with heart damage, and it's just amazing.  Hearts after...  Oh, gnarly!  Hearts after they do the bypass surgeries and stuff.  It's just really, really...  Yeah, something tells me there are probably a lot of, maybe homeless people.  Maybe people down on their luck.  I don't know.  You think?  They got a few bucks beforehand?  I don't know.  That's a good question, you know?  I'm amazed they're able to display this stuff.  I'd love to know more about it. 
[02:09:00]  But there you go.  That's what I did on Saturday.  How much is it to get in?  It was like $25 a per...  It was so worth it.  Yeah.  It was just...  $25, huh?  It's something I'll be talking about for, God, probably the rest of my life.  Can you take pictures in there?  Yeah, people were taking pictures, sure.  Smile.  Yeah.  You know, then they have all sorts of slices of the body.  It just went on and on and on.  It's been taking a lab sticker on one of those little dead hands.  Look at cancer lungs.  Yeah, the cancer lungs and...  Can I see cancer lungs?  They're dirty. 
[02:09:30]  See?  Aren't you happy you stopped smoking?  Yes.  Here you go.  A black lung and a nice white pinkish lung.  That's RV.  That's the initials of that person.  RV?  Oh.  I was like, how do they know that?  Oh.  This is a big black lung and two massive sets of choppers.  Yeah.  Little tiny fingers.  Yes.  How come there's no knuckle?  Oh, that's the whole hand.  I thought that was just a half a baby hand.  Oh, look.  They removed the brain from this one.  No, we didn't. 
[02:10:00]  And they did have...  They had a room that might as well have been a sideshow because they had like pickled punks,  basically, with all the birth defects completely intact.  They didn't mess with those.  They had Siamese twins and all that.  So you got the nice sideshow angle as well.  Dustin in Philly.  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  Hey.  You know what really bothered me at the end of that was the guest book and all those nut  cases that were upset about the exhibit because they were upset for religious reasons, and 
[02:10:30]  I didn't quite understand that.  Yeah.  Why did they even bother going?  Yeah, exactly.  There's no shock of what that was about.  It's bodies.  Right.  All right.  Well, there's a lot of people protesting this for many, many different reasons.  Yeah.  I forgot to mention, it's Louis from South Jersey.  Did Opie mention the mom, dad, and kid in veins?  Kid had the thumbs up.  Thumbs up.  It was a mom and dad.  All it was was the veins and capillaries, like I was explaining, which forms your body 
[02:11:00]  when there's nothing else there.  And the kid was in the dad's arms, and he had a thumb, he was just in his dad's arms  with thumbs up.  How old of a kid would you say the veins were?  Could you tell?  Probably like a year, maybe tops.  Yeah, a year old.  Tops, probably less.  They removed the vein from this one.  No, he didn't.  The boss is a mox. 
[02:11:30]  All right.  Well, enough of that.  That's something I would never go to.  Really?  Why?  Yeah, it's too creepy.  Why?  Too creepy.  Because I have to sleep at some point.  I have to leave that exhibit, and at some point, whether it be days later or something,  I would have to shut my eyes and sleep, and the nightmares of those faces, because the  faces look like some of that of a monster movie.  Yeah, definitely.  A little stripped of the skin.  Absolutely. 
[02:12:00]  I wouldn't give you a nightmare?  Nah, because...  That they're chasing you around?  Not that, because that's not that bad, no.  I've seen other things that have given me nightmares, but that's not one.  Like what?  Beheading videos.  And those that have given you nightmares?  Yes.  Yeah, I can't watch those.  That's the worst.  I don't watch those either.  Can't watch them.  I'll watch them.  Thank you.  I watch the U.S. military videos.  There's a shitload of those up on the web now.  You go to the right sites, you can see all the military footage of our snipers, and  airstrikes on people and stuff, and that's fine.  Like, I could watch some Iraqi come apart in the street, seeing that. 
[02:12:30]  Helicopter, or some kind of airplane coming around and opening up big guns that are meant  to take out tanks and trucks, opened up on a person, and you see it in the night vision?  Yeah.  The guy just instantly becomes chopped meat.  Oh, that I could watch.  Because it's more American.  It's further away.  It's video game-ish.  And it's from a distance, too.  Yeah.  A little bit, so.  Did you see the video?  It's either Ogre-ish or one of those, like, uh... 
[02:13:00]  Fuck that.  No, no, no.  This is not that bad.  This is not that bad.  I don't go to Ogre-ish.  This is a video of a guy whose face was torn off by a bear.  I don't know if that's the guy that you're talking about on the Today Show.  Oh, I think I saw that.  And he's going to have his face replaced.  Face transplant.  But his face, it looks like a half a moon.  Like, his whole fucking face is gone.  He was eaten at, was clawed out or something.  How did the bear do that?  Ask.  He's doing production.  Oh, okay.  We'll ask him later how that might have happened.  There was the coolest fucking video I saw on U.S. military. 
[02:13:30]  I think it was one of the security firms that are over there, and they own these black helicopters.  And they show this helicopter flying over Baghdad.  And the guys in there just seem like they're having a good time.  Like, one guy's hanging out the side with a camcorder in his hand,  and he points it at the pilot from the outside of the helicopter.  The pilot looks over and just sticks his tongue out at the guy.  Like, they're fucking around.  You go down to street level.  The helicopter, you know those big crossed swords?  Oh, of course.  Over the highways?  Yeah.  Flies underneath this fucking thing. 
[02:14:00]  Wow.  At street level.  All to, like, hardcore metal music.  They're making music videos out of their home videos.  They send them back here, and people put them to the music.  And you're watching guys being blown up and shit, you know, the firefights going on.  And it's all done like a music video.  It's amazing what the hell is going on these days where years ago it was just Dan Rather in Vietnam or something.  And you'd get the films months later, and they'd put together a thing.  Now, right after shit happens, there they are. 
[02:14:30]  Marines, Fallujah.  You download it, watch the music video.  Right on the internet.  Right on the internet.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to get back on track here.  So, Earl did the Black Rock Coalition on Saturday at midnight, this past Saturday night at midnight.  This is a new thing we want to really try.  We really want to fill the weekends up with a bunch of shit.  A bunch of shit.  And we started with the Black Rock Coalition.  And I'm hearing that he did a very, very good job.  Will this change the mind of Elo?  Because I know Elo heard the pitch at one of the soirees Opie was throwing at his house one day. 
[02:15:00]  Ooh.  Yeah.  And Earl was there and pitched it to Elo.  And Elo, when he came in last week, said it was the worst pitch he'd ever gotten.  Yep.  This piece of shit will never see the light of day.  Like, he really tore Earl apart.  Well.  But we gave Earl a chance to do the show live because maybe Earl couldn't communicate it to Elo.  So we had him do the show, and now he's got a demo tape.  Well, we need a show for this Saturday at midnight. 
[02:15:30]  Mm-hmm.  We need something.  Yeah.  Maybe it's Big A and no filter Paul and his wife Denise just shooting the shit.  Oh.  I don't know.  Well, we've got to do something, though.  We've just got to throw some shit.  We're calling it shit.  Shit.  We're throwing shit on this channel every Saturday night at midnight for a little while.  All right?  Nice.  Shit.  And then we'll develop some other shit.  Because I'm sick of hearing the reruns all weekend long.  Would you ever have these guys that won golden tickets come in and do some sort of auditions? 
[02:16:00]  It's a way to get them on a little bit.  No.  We're done with the golden ticket idea.  All right.  We're not going to be hiring radio shows.  We've decided.  Oh, really?  It's a stupid, stupid idea.  Yeah.  Everyone.  It's a stupid idea.  It's now on the fuck-o list.  Okay.  Let the little doggy company do it.  It's the dumbest idea ever to take other shows from commercial radio and throw it up on  satellite radio.  Dude, it's that type of an attitude that cost us Martha Stewart.  Oh, I got Martha Stewart audio for you?  There are only certain radio shows that can really make the transition to a satellite and 
[02:16:30]  make it worthwhile.  See, I believe XM eventually is going to be an entertainment company.  XM Entertainment.  Satellite Entertainment.  XM Satellite Radio and Entertainment.  I'd take the radio out.  Eventually take the radio out.  Okay.  Like WWF, WWE.  That's right.  That's where we see this going.  So to hire dumb radio shows that are like, eh, most people listen to these dumb radio  shows because there's nothing else.  Right.  And one of the big arguments that people have, regular radio people, it's always, why are 
[02:17:00]  people going to pay for something they could get for free?  When you take a regular radio show and put it on satellite, it is pretty much like every  other radio show you could get for free.  Right.  Things like us, I like to think of as unique.  That's right.  And you cannot get something like that.  I don't even, you can't even hear this on satellite.  Satellite.  There's really nothing like this going on right now.  Right.  Whether there will be more in the future, I don't know.  But there's nothing really like this program on satellite or regular radio.  Anthony and I are officially leaving the radio world behind. 
[02:17:30]  Yes.  But we'll still do radio.  But it'll be more satellite entertainment.  We're going to get, we're going to have a lot more respect.  We're branching out.  That's right.  And I want to be an astronaut.  Yeah, so do I.  All right.  So Black Girl did.  Wait, I'm sorry.  What, what, what, what, Martha Stewart audio?  Now you have to play it now.  I'm just curious as to what it was.  No, it's really quick.  Well, I'm sure it's cuntly, whatever it is.  It's really quick.  Awful woman.  Martha Stewart, her Apprentice show was canceled.  Why?  It was horrible. 
[02:18:00]  No one cared.  It got shit ratings.  She was huge because of her going to jail and all that.  So stupid, the little doggy company spent millions and millions on her to do a dumb radio show.  She doesn't even know how to do radio.  And then they threw her on TV too, NBC or whoever it was.  And that show failed miserably.  Absolutely awful.  Because she stinks.  She stinks.  Well, it would have been great if we could have gotten her here at XM.  Did Trump call in or come in? 
[02:18:30]  I called in.  He was great.  That's great.  We had a lot of fun with Trump when he called in last week.  The Donald.  But we got a clip of Martha Stewart's TV show.  Listen to this.  Listen to how awful this is.  Which show is this?  The Apprentice thing or?  The Apprentice.  Because she's got like three shows.  This is why her Apprentice show failed miserably and it's no longer on TV.  Listen closely.  Can I have a piece of your sugar bun, please?  Oh, Marcella.  Martha asked me for a piece of my sugar bun.  This is unbelievable.  It's such an intimate experience to be sharing with her. 
[02:19:00]  I need to pinch myself right now.  I just can't believe this is happening.  Weren't those sugar buns delicious?  She gets a show on NBC with that shit.  All these shows, too.  That shit.  I'm sorry.  They edit and talk to these people and it's always the same.  Just like that.  It's like, hey, how you doing this morning?  You know, when she asked me how I was doing, it was just one of the most wonderful points 
[02:19:30]  in my life, they take the most who gives a shit moment and just try to blow it up into  something.  I don't like the fact that they were talking about sugar buns, but everyone knows that's  my nickname for Hawk.  But that's why the show was canceled.  It was babble like that.  I didn't get the ratings.  Who could enjoy that?  It's unbelievable.  Hey, sugar buns.  Asked me for my sugar buns, did you?  Yeah, right here up on the stage. 
[02:20:00]  Teddy Tom.  Hey, Martha, you want to see it?  I'll get up on the stage with my sugar buns.  What did he call his buns?  Golden buns.  Golden buns.  Tippi Tom.  See, I try some of your golden buns.  You can have a golden bun.  I'll take my underwear off.  The return of Tippi Tom, I think, this week, Anthony.  I don't want to throw it on the stage.  Fucking drunk animal.  He's got something on him that'll make Bill puke, by the way.  His smell. 
[02:20:30]  Just his scent.  Keith is going to try to get Tippi Tom on the radio this week as we get closer to the  homeless shopping.  Those underwear, right?  Oh, yeah.  The green, brown underwear.  Another dumb clip from TV for you.  Imagine when it rains what he's like.  He's going to share two of his recipes from Al Roker's hassle-free holiday cookbook.  Al, what are we here to make?  Well, we are here to make my mother's world-famous sweet potato poon, which is basically...  Poon?  Yes, that's what she calls it. 
[02:21:00]  Wow.  Sweet potato poon?  Jesus.  Just in case you missed it from the Tony Danza show.  He's here.  Imagine when it rains what he's like.  He's going to share two of his recipes from Al Roker's hassle-free holiday cookbook.  Al, what are we here to make?  Well, we are here to make my mother's world-famous sweet potato poon, which is basically...  Poon?  Yes, that's what she calls it.  My mother made an eggplant coon.  You'd be an Italian and old. 
[02:21:30]  Wow.  Sweet potato poon.  What a lovely childhood he must have had.  That's what she called it.  Come here.  Now, you come here and eat your mama's sweet potato poon.  Yes, mom.  Why do I have to do this?  Because your daddy left.  Sweet potato poon.  I hope Al didn't talk like that on the set of that Peter Jackson film.  Is the poon tangy? 
[02:22:00]  Horrid.  How amazing is that?  But, anyway.  What was sweet potato poon?  Did we find out?  No.  Because we couldn't watch the rest of the Tony Danza show.  A little chopper crash.  Couldn't watch the rest of it.  Where?  I don't know.  They showed a helicopter on the ground.  Oh, okay.  No big deal.  Those things go down every week now.  Good point.  All right.  Black Rock College.  We've got to get some of this out of the way.  So, Earl got the channel this past Saturday night for a couple hours, and he was playing 
[02:22:30]  music from a black artist, I guess.  Of course.  That's the whole gist of the show, isn't it?  And here's the first words from Black Earl.  Here it is.  Thank you, sweet Jesus.  The wait is over.  I'm your host, Earl Douglas.  I want to dedicate this show to our dear friend, Mr. Fez Watley.  Feel better, my friends.  I also want to send it out to my friend and mentor, Mr. Scott Muni.  I don't think he was listening. 
[02:23:00]  Loving the death.  Two hours of the best Black Rock.  Here he is.  Scott Muni's being, he's on exhibit at Body Worlds.  They got him behind a microphone and a couple of turntables in front of him.  And a bottle of whiskey.  A bottle of whiskey and a Who record in his hand.  And he's interviewing a corpse with glasses and a bullet through his head.  Earl. 
[02:23:30]  Ew.  Hey, buddy.  Way to go on the Black Rock thing dedicated to two white people.  Yeah.  Fez and Muni.  Yeah, two white brothers.  Two white devils.  Oh, hey.  They're my friends.  What am I going to say?  I must say, just from listening to that quick clip, Earl with more energy than I've ever heard.  Of course.  Out of Earl.  Very high energy.  Let's finish the first break here.  Period.  I'm going to start it off with...  I didn't know what I was going to play until about ten seconds ago. 
[02:24:00]  But I figured, why not start with the best?  Bad Brains.  Black Rock Coalition Radio.  Oof.  Bad Brains.  Bad Brains.  Earl.  Oh, go ahead.  Earl.  Yeah.  Who's Bad Brains?  That's the band.  Yeah.  Who are they?  Four guys from D.C.  Best hardcore band of all time.  Of all time.  Are they still playing, Earl?  Yes.  I'll give $100 to anyone in the studio that can name one Bad Brains song. 
[02:24:30]  Back to Tomorrow.  Shut up.  I'm not buying it.  I thought I was a better actor.  I was like...  I can finally read you.  I thought you would...  Back to Tomorrow.  Back to Tomorrow.  Back to Tomorrow.  All right.  Let's play more audio from the Black Rock Coalition with Black Earl Douglas.  Black Rock Coalition Radio on XM 202.  The phone number again is 866-766-0339.  You can also email us at info at blackrockcoalition.org. 
[02:25:00]  I want to thank everyone for all the kind words, all the great support.  And let's just keep it rolling here.  Classic Finn Lizzy.  The Rocker.  Black Rock Coalition Radio, XM 202.  Thin Lizzy had a black guy in it?  Yeah, Phil Leiter, the front man.  The lead singer of Thin Lizzy was black?  Black?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  I never knew that.  I didn't either.  Looks like my record collection is going to get a little smaller after today. 
[02:25:30]  I didn't have that in my house.  Thin Kizzy.  Who knew?  Really?  Phil Leiter.  Look what you get to learn from listening to the Black Rock Coalition.  That's right.  Nothing.  Earl, halfway through, is it true you gave out the recipe for sweet potato poons?  No.  No?  I was getting reports.  Maybe that happened.  I am jumping ahead a little bit, but I was mooned by Danny.  Yeah?  The monitors got completely knocked over. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  It was just a show within a show going on.  And Earl was doing coon twofers.  No, I was not doing coon twofers.  That's funny.  I was doing twofers.  Jesus.  I heard that the boys, they came in Saturday night, they were hammered.  All drunk.  And just made your life a living hell.  Danny's like mooning you.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  They were trying to lick your ear, and they were just making it a miserable experience  for you.  Drunk white guys were his posse for the Black Rock Coalition.  It was supposed to be a very, very big day for Earl, and these guys made it a nightmare. 
[02:26:30]  There were like two chicks there, and one of the other guys just talking, just drunken  babble that he's two chicks.  Yeah.  It was just, like I said, it was a show within a show going on.  Yes, yes.  Well, we got some audio of, this next clip is of Danny drunk?  Probably.  I don't really remember much.  Let's take a listen to this.  More audio from the Black Rock Coalition.  Oh, my God.  We got jammed phone lines, which I never expected.  And we're going to try an experiment in terror here. 
[02:27:00]  I'm going to take a call here, and let's just, I'm just going to take a call, and let's  see what happens.  Hello.  You're on Black Rock Coalition Radio.  Who is this?  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  You're on the air.  Hey, Robert.  Hello.  Hello.  Yes.  You're on the air.  What can we do for you?  Yeah, you're kicking ass, man.  I just wish the XM would tell me who's the artist and the name of the song.  Well, I was going to get to that, but I had to thank a few people, and we're still getting 
[02:27:30]  a few people.  God, how many people are you going to thank during this show?  You're only on for two hours, bro.  You're not accepting an Oscar.  Jesus.  Well, there was so much going on.  So much done really last minute.  I want to thank the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King.  I want to thank Abraham Lincoln.  Mike Mars worked his ass off, and then the phones kept blowing out, and I just wanted to  thank those guys for all the help.  Right.  Stop with the thank yous.  You've had enough already.  Fuck them all, man.  Just do your show. 
[02:28:00]  And take all the credits.  That's what we do every day.  And we're still getting it all together here.  The last artist we heard was Pillow Theory.  And the song's called Drama Fiction Fiend.  Fucking...  Who the fuck is Pillow Theory?  Do they do Drama Fiction Fiend?  Yeah.  Ah, I know.  I know it.  That's one of the songs they do.  Shut up, Anthony.  What?  How did you get that answer?  Because Earl just said it.  Oh, he did?  No, I didn't even listen.  Pillow Theory. 
[02:28:30]  Actually, Opie, you would love this band.  No, I wouldn't.  Yes, you would.  I swear to God, you would love this band.  Found any Pillow Theory in the Dillette there, Hawk?  Nope.  There's one of these bands in Dillette.  What a shame.  All right, back to the audio.  Drama Fiction Fiend off of the Black Rock Coalition's latest CD, Rock and Roll Reparations.  If you want to find out more about that CD, you can go to blackrockcoalition.org.  Why the militant attitude?  Why can't we just enjoy music from black artists, rock music from black artists, 
[02:29:00]  without feeling like I've got to dig into my pocket and give reparations  for something my great-great-great-great-grandpappy might have done?  Exactly.  That's right.  And we still profit from it.  Well, Anthony, everybody knows Italians are half black anyway.  Well, you know, the Moors.  When Sicily was invaded, your great-great-great-great-grandmother hosted the Black Rock Coalition.  Oh!  Get Earl back in the phone.  I love this guy.  I hung up on him by accident. 
[02:29:30]  Max in Ohio.  Max.  Hey there.  Hey, man.  I hate to call him out on this, but Phil Lenat, the lead singer of Thin Lizzy, he isn't black.  He's Welsh.  What?  Is he a black Welsh?  No, no, no.  He's like Welsh, like Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Earl's not even playing black artists?  No, he's not black.  He's Welsh.  He's Welsh?  He's Welsh.  Let me see.  I'm punching up a picture here.  All right.  Hold on there, man.  Thin Lizzy.  Do we have an album cover? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, we, uh...  All right, let's play the rest of this audio as you find out.  I don't see a black guy in there.  You can go to blackrockcoalition.org, and thanks for the call.  As you can hear, I'm just trying to catch my breath here, trying to get it all together.  Having a lot of fun, and you know what?  We're going to take another call here.  Let's see.  Hello?  Hi, you're on Black Rock Coalition Radio.  What's your name?  Oh, my name is Billy, and the show sounds really great.  Nice bands playing.  How's the show going on?  Is it going all right?  And I wonder if you could play a song for me. 
[02:30:30]  I love the black rock, man.  It's like the best rock I could even imagine.  It's black.  It's black.  It's black.  You can hear Danny.  It's rock.  It's...  What else do you need?  It's black, and it's rock, and rules.  Danny, don't get out, you drunk.  They are so annihilated right now.  Can you hear me?  I want to make a request.  Oh, what would you like to hear?  I want to hear Funky Town.  Wait, help.  Thank you.  I'm then inflated over the phone.  I knew this was going to happen.  What did I expect?  I mean, the O&A guys, it's always fun. 
[02:31:00]  It's always a good time.  You know what?  I'm not going to babble anymore.  We're going to get right back into some music, and Black Rock Coalition Radio on XM 202.  Oh, Earl was flustered at the end of that.  And Danny, you just came in all hammered and just decided to fuck up a show?  Yeah, we all met up here, went out for a few cocktails, and figured we'd just wreck Earl's...  A few?  Huh?  Yeah, a few.  A few?  A couple.  Just wreck every break that Earl did.  And Earl, that Thin Lizzy guy is not black. 
[02:31:30]  He's not black enough.  What, Phil line it?  Not even not black enough.  He is not black.  He is half black.  Half black?  Black father, Irish mother.  Hell no.  He would be a little darker if he was half black.  He fits into the Black Rock Coalition.  Thin Lizzy fits in because one of the guys in the band is half black.  He's a mean singer-songwriter?  He's...  What does that guy say he is?  Max in Ohio.  Max, go ahead.  You're on with black Earl.  Hey, Earl.  Sorry, man.  He's Welsh.  He's not black. 
[02:32:00]  His mother is Welsh.  Huh?  That's right.  His mother.  Right.  His mother's Welsh.  His father is black.  Nah.  Wow, that's a reach there, Earl.  Yeah, Earl, you can't...  I think you're reaching for artists.  He had a black friend in high school, so he fits in?  That's awful.  All right, here's Earl, more audio from his Black Rock Coalition this past Saturday night.  Black Rock Coalition Radio, XM 202, and we're just going to keep right on moving here with...  You fucked up!  You fucked up!  You fucked up!  You fucked up! 
[02:32:30]  You fucked up!  As you can see, we're having a nice little party here, and thank you, ONA, for sending  me the most drunken crew you can get your hands on.  And we're going to keep it right moving.  Keep things moving right along.  Wow.  Earl, they had you so fucked up, man.  For moving and keeping moving and moving things right along.  You weren't moving.  Yeah.  Between nerves and being flustered, it was...  The more I think about the show, it's like, oh, God.  So, Danny, as soon as he fucked up, you guys just decided to just pounce on him? 
[02:33:00]  Well, I guess.  I really don't remember, but apparently he fucked up.  So, we decided to do the old school E.C. dub chant.  Yeah.  No, you just did it randomly.  I did fuck up later.  Yeah.  Eric wants in?  Yeah.  What happened was, it was during that song, he kept turning the CD button off.  So, twice throughout the song, the music went off and it was dead air.  Yeah.  I have no recollection of doing it, but I guess that's what happened.  All right.  We got more audio.  Danny, drunk in the background here again.  Black Rock Coalition Radio on XM 202. 
[02:33:30]  Jean-Paul Borelli out of Chicago with Got to Be Able to Know off of his album Saints and Sinners.  Before that, we heard some Betty Davis with Steppin' Out in Her iMiller Shoes from her self-titled  debut album from 1973.  And Danny is here from the ONA show just staring right through me.  I mean, say hello, Danny.  Wow.  Oh, Earl, you're gulping. 
[02:34:00]  You were gulping, Earl.  You got the dry mouth and you're gulping.  Who was that first band?  Oh, the first guy?  Yeah.  Jean-Paul Borelli.  Jean-Paul Borelli.  He sounds French.  Yeah, that's not a black.  Now, Earl, is it true that this guy isn't black, but he likes Cheetos and grape soda?  Comment?  Earl?  As I was saying, Jean-Paul Borelli, he's a guitarist out of Chicago.  Oh, all right.  Oh, my God.  That's wonderful. 
[02:34:30]  Back to the audio.  Hello.  Why do you keep calling?  Oh, wait.  Who's this?  Uh, maybe.  Uh-huh.  I know, Geico Insurance.  I do a radio show.  I'm on the air right now and my phone keeps ringing into the microphone.  And right now, millions of people are listening to my side of this conversation.  Do you understand? 
[02:35:00]  Do you understand?  Call me later.  Wait, wait.  Can you ask them a question about Geico?  Is that the Geico Insurance?  That's the Geico guy, Jimmy.  I heard that the Geico lizard has AIDS.  The Geico lizard has AIDS.  No.  No, they don't.  So, you got that?  Call me later.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Good day, sir.  All right, back to the Black Rock Coalition audio.  Really?  I mean, say hello, Danny.  Hello, everybody. 
[02:35:30]  It's the Black Rock Coalition, Negroes.  Oh, my God.  Danny.  Wow.  You don't remember any of this, Danny?  Oh, little bits and pieces.  Holy shit.  You know, this is probably what it feels like to be at your own intervention.  Contrary to popular opinion, I'm the head nigger in charge.  Nathaniel?  Anything to add to this?  No, I think Danny's audio speaks for itself. 
[02:36:00]  I didn't know Black Rock Coalition was one word, but apparently, when you're hammered, it is.  This turned into the Danny show.  Let's listen in here some more.  It's the Black Rock Coalition, Negroes.  Danny.  What?  Behave, Danny.  I'm behaving.  You're so drunk.  Ow.  It's Earl's moment.  Oh, God.  Let me see here.  Who is on line five?  Kyle. 
[02:36:30]  Kyle, you're on Black Rock Coalition radio.  Hello.  How's it going, Earl?  How are you?  I'm doing great.  You're doing an awesome show.  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  You know, he's listening.  He's going to have to sign you up after this.  Yeah, you know what?  That's Eric Logan's calling.  I've got to thank Eric.  He, despite the fact that he didn't really like the demo that I did for him, he still  gave me a shot.  So, I've got to thank Eric.  Another thank you.  Kyle, you're still there.  Yeah, we lost Kyle.  Oh, God.  Danny is mooning the... 
[02:37:00]  Oh, God.  We've got a bunch of people in here, and I just...  Yeah.  What a mess.  What a mess.  The white man ruined it.  Anyway.  We're going to get right back to the music right now.  We're going to play some Cypress Hill.  We're going to do some Rock Superstar here on Black Rock Coalition radio.  XM 202.  Flippin' sweet.  Got a lot of...  Wow, Earl.  Danny was just fucking up your world, huh?  Poor Earl.  The white man coming in and keeping you down. 
[02:37:30]  I mean, he had his...  Basically had his pants around his ankles.  Ugh.  Bare-ass naked.  Oh.  Why were you naked?  I was not.  I just wanted to mess Earl up.  I just wanted to fluster him.  You fluster...  I mean, the whole room was horrified.  Danny, you know, it's not always about you, sir.  Yes.  It certainly is.  This was Earl's moment to shine.  Yeah.  Shine.  Earl's moment to shine.  And, uh...  Boy, you were stepping on him. 
[02:38:00]  Like, right now, it's Earl's moment.  And I'm sitting here.  I kind of pissed my pants, uh, for real.  And I have, like, fucking urine in my underwear right now.  Because I was whizzing into a cup to make Danny laugh under the table.  And I fucking put my mule away.  Is that your urine?  It sure is.  Why is it that color?  Yeah, what is wrong with it?  You have a problem.  It's cloudy.  It's because Starbucks was in there.  That's the end of my latte.  Oh, God.  And I was whizzing into a cup under the console.  And when I put my mule away, between, like, the bladder, like, I didn't get to shake. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  So it all fucking dribbled out into my underwear.  You're at yourself.  I'm fucking...  I got a big spot.  In front of your pants are all wet, you animal.  I'm not going to show my mule.  Look, this is my underwear.  Oh, God.  All right.  Earl, we got to get back...  Jesus, what is...  Earl, hold on a minute.  We got to get back to Earl in a second.  Uh...  That's unbelievable, man.  That's why I had to run out, because I felt like...  I was like, ah, this is not cool.  No, it's not. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  We'll get back into the Black Rock Coalition audio in a second, but we have a big star on  hold that wants to say hi to Kay.  Yes, we do.  Waiting for them to get him back on hold so we can pick him up.  Ladies and gentlemen, how do you know if he's on hold?  Huh?  Ben's got him.  Ben's got him.  Oh, cool.  Oh.  It's Billy West, everyone.  Yes, it is.  Billy.  Yabbo.  There he is.  It's Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton, big fans of Billy West.  How are you, sir?  I know who you guys are.  I know everything about you.  Is that good or bad? 
[02:39:30]  Men.  Men.  Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  I made it with a woman.  Alert the men.  Billy West.  The voice of everything.  Not everything.  You have...  No, you jumped into just about everything.  I'm amazed.  Didn't you do...  Wind up getting like Bugs Bunny's gig?  Yeah.  I did that for 10 years.  Christ.  And...  The Warner Brothers gig.  Yeah, the Warner Brothers gig.  I did Space Jam and I did...  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  You know, Bugs and Elmer Fudd.  And then Ren and Stimpy?  Yeah.  You, of course, were doing Stimpy.  But I guess who...  John K. was doing Ren.  Yeah.  And then he gets fired.  And then he got fired from his own show.  But I was the original guy who was supposed to do both.  I was given a tape with what they wanted for both voices.  Uh-huh.  And I did the original demo.  And that's what sold the show over at Nickelodeon.  So, I mean, everybody likes to fantasize, you know, that I just flew in there and, you know, 
[02:40:30]  grabbed up everything.  And it's like, I didn't give a fat frog's ass who did the other voice.  I really didn't.  Yeah, because the Stimpy voice is great, of course.  So, hey, Ren, will you button me?  Oh, I'm just going to kill you.  And then you ended up all over Nickelodeon.  Yeah.  Man, the Honey Nuts Cheerio guy.  How did you get so much work so fast?  I think I kind of had, from being on the radio in Manhattan, I think I had kind of an electronic 
[02:41:00]  business card, you know, because everybody on Madison Avenue listens to everybody who's  on the radio.  Howie.  You know, and I was one of those guys.  I was in that mindset.  Think about it, you know.  Like, when you were starting out, you just wanted to be flavor of the month 12 times a  year.  Right.  You know what I mean?  That's how I went in there, like a Terminator.  Yeah.  I mean, you pretty much changed Howard's show.  It took on a whole other direction.  Yeah.  You were a talent on there that brought it up to another level. 
[02:41:30]  Well, I was facilitated in different ways.  You know, like, they'd get me going on a certain premise, or they'd say, hey, try this  tomorrow.  And then, you know, of course, Jackie was the million dollar man.  I mean, he used to, you know, he'd hand me something that was like worth a million dollars  in comedy dollars.  You know what I mean?  It was, uh, that was like the golden age of Stern's show, uh, with Jackie and you there.  Some of the stuff.  Some of the stuff.  I, you know, it's like, I haven't listened in an awful long time. 
[02:42:00]  And, um, I'm, I'm a big fan of, like, AM radio.  Right.  And I listen to, uh, you know, the liberal talk shows that are starting to flourish in  the face of all that other right-wing crap, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, both sides can be pretty entertaining, though, when they, they really go off.  Yeah.  But there's, um, there's this thing that, you know, over the years, everybody was trying  to, you know, conjure up, like, what must have happened over there when I left. 
[02:42:30]  And I used to read the posts and I used to go, I don't remember this asshole being in  the room when I said these things and did them.  Really?  You know, and everybody's an expert.  Here's what happened.  Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of...  It really went in there one day and he's ungrateful and, you know, he, he, he, he, he, he, he.  Yeah, there was a lot of controversy as to why you left, because, uh, you definitely were  a shining star on that show.  I, uh, some of the, the most memorable things that came out of Howard's show was, uh, Billy  West, the, the Marge shot stuff.  The Marge shot thing.  I, I used to listen every morning when I was working.  And, uh, uh, when I was actually working for a living in, in, in, in, in, 
[02:43:00]  construction and the Marge shot thing, the fucking Woodstock thing was, uh, probably  one of the funniest things that was ever done.  Allison Steele doing the voiceover.  Allison Steele, God damn it.  And, uh, you doing Larry Fine.  Well, Larry was the basis for, uh, Stimpy's voice.  Yeah.  Stimpy.  And no one did Larry fucking...  That's an old Jewish guy, so we had to catch him up, you know.  No one did Larry Fine.  It was, and it was a dead-on Larry Fine. 
[02:43:30]  It's like, God damn.  I thought that was so sublim, I don't know, so sublime, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's like, uh...  And then putting him totally out of context into Woodstock was, that, that bit was fantastic.  Everything out of context with the Stooges is funny.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like, hey, Moe, I broke your Pesach dishes.  Oh, I think nothing of it, kid.  Why are you, Emerson?  This is the meat and this is the dairy.  Ow!  Hey, you missed one.  No, I didn't.  God damn it. 
[02:44:00]  He's talking about them, yeah.  Wait a minute.  Is that Yiddish for go take a shit in the ocean?  Like, hur, hur, hur, hur, hur.  Oh, a wandering Jew, eh?  Well, get wandering.  You must have just grown up sitting in front of the television forever.  Oh, yeah.  But you know what?  I was right.  My mother thought that they were idiots.  Yeah.  Stooges, he said, how can you watch those awful men?  And look, I thought Moe was a genius, but I didn't know why.  And then, believe it or not, he and Albert Einstein had a lot and had something in common.  I know you won't believe this, but it's true. 
[02:44:30]  Moe actually explained E equals MC squared, the theory of relativity.  Yeah.  When he said, we ain't getting no place fast.  And I said, oh, my God, it's true.  He has a link to Albert Einstein.  Except Moe said it where I could understand it, you know.  Did you grow up on that, though, watching a lot of cartoons, Mel Blanc?  Oh, sure, sure.  I watched it all and wondered, how the hell can someone do this? 
[02:45:00]  Because he wasn't just a collection of witty little voices.  That guy was the best damn actor.  Yeah.  You know, and I know, I think Anthony does voices, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony does amazing voices.  It's just, you know, it's a lifetime of watching a lot of television and being a minor bird.  Yeah, create your own characters, though.  Because Impressionist, it is my feeling on it.  It's like, you know, we all wanted to be like Rich Little or Frank Gorshin or the other guy there, David Fry. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  And one day we woke up in an America that didn't give a fuck about Impressionists.  Yeah, true.  You know what I mean?  So as soon as I started doing, like, original characters, all of a sudden it was like, wow, look at that.  You know, and I felt like none of my things that I could ever come up with could measure up to what Mel Blanc did and that.  But that's not the point.  You've got to be, you can't be the next, you can't be the next Mel Blanc by doing Mel Blanc's voices.  No.  You know, you've got to be like the best you.  Yeah, that was amazing.  He came up with all of them and so many of them, you know, and they were so different. 
[02:46:00]  It wasn't like, oh, you could tell this is the same guy doing this voice or that voice.  Yeah.  Well, he inspired me to try to be as diverse as possible, you know, like, gosh, like on Futurama.  Yeah.  I tried to split it up, you know, to be like Zap Brannigan, you know, this is Zap Brannigan, master of time and space and everything in between.  And, oh, yeah, winner of this year's Modesty Award.  Yeah.  He was based on all the big dumb announcers I came up with who love far and away above everything else, the sound of their own voice. 
[02:46:30]  They keep their balls in the wheelbarrow.  Well, you know, it's like trying to make eight-syllable words out of one.  Yeah.  Coming to the Worcester Centrum, meh.  Back to the Howard thing, though.  What actually did happen, because you guys were just riding a rocket ship, and then to have what I see, I don't know how modest you are,  but what I see was a huge part of that show just disappear from it. 
[02:47:00]  I wasn't really aware of that until years later I started reading posts, you know, and it was like, hey, I'm saying it's almost 10 years and people are still going back and forth about this.  Like, what the heck?  And, you know, I mean, I've always said that I thought Howard was the greatest, and I never blamed him for my problems with management at K-Rock when I wanted a raise.  You know what I mean?  I mean, they just stopped returning my solicitor's phone call, so I said to my son.  How could they not give you a raise? 
[02:47:30]  I don't know.  Look, you know, I mean.  This business is filled with guys that are doing radio that just stink, and then.  They don't get it.  Every once in a while there's a talent that comes along like a Billy West.  You got it.  You got it.  Take care of them.  Well, I mean, they used to have these guys propped up there like Scott and Todd and this and Franny and Zooey and Ricky and Vicky.  Yeah.  You know, and I say, these guys got that certain nothing, don't they?  No shit.  You know, and I'm going, how good do you have to frickin' be, you know, to get some money?  And it's like, not everybody wants to live in a sewer. 
[02:48:00]  Right.  I'm not calling New York a sewer, but you've got to have money to live there and stay away from the sewer.  And it's ridiculous there.  And they just stopped returning my lawyer's phone call, so I said to myself,  Hey, you know what?  I'm not a victim.  I just went into Howard to say I'm leaving, and that I respected him, and I loved him, and I thanked him for the time there.  And, you know, for the first time in 12 years, I didn't know where I was going, because I worked in Boston.  Yeah.  I'm not trying to make any, you know, battle here or anything. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  Did he go to bat for you?  I mean, that's...  See, I have no idea, but I never expected anything from anybody.  I just said...  Yeah, I know you don't expect anything, but Jesus Christ.  He backed me with a clear sign that said, you know, well, you're not that valuable.  So I didn't blame anybody or get mad or bitter.  I just said, well, the chance of making real big money here will never happen if I can't get a raise.  That's just amazing.  Well, as far as the money goes, I'm sure you showed them, but, you know, I mean...  You know what it is? 
[02:49:00]  I'm, like, the nicest guy.  I'm the most, like, you know, like, I don't know what do you call it, sort of a reticent guy when it comes to asking for money.  Mm-hmm.  And I realized, you've got to be, like, fucking Tony Soprano or something nowadays.  God damn, I used to be the same fucking way.  No shit, I was just...  I was in there.  It was...  You fucking shut the rule.  I want a fucking raise.  You understand how fucking hard it is to live in New Jersey with no fucking money?  This is the last fucking Sunday dinner I ever have at this house. 
[02:49:30]  There's a time you go through.  It always sounds like he's ready to cry.  You know, Tony, Tony, you were never very good at athletics.  What the fuck are you going to say that for, Uncle Jones?  What's the matter with you?  There's a time you go through where you're just kind of happy to be there.  Yeah, I know.  And the money thing, it definitely is not even an issue.  But then when you realize, you know, your car is falling apart and you've got to make your bills,  you kind of want to at least be compensated for what you're doing and the capacity that you're doing. 
[02:50:00]  Can I tell you this?  Billy West is a very inspirational phone call.  I hope you all realize that.  Absolutely.  Absolutely, Jimmy.  Listen, you know what?  This is coming soon.  No, no, I guess I'm here to teach lessons and whatever.  Yeah.  You know, for aspiring radio people, it's, you know, just, like, eat the shit sandwich for a while,  but don't leave that as your precedent, you know?  You're not going to say it, but it's pretty obvious that someone's ego got in the way and it's too bad because...  I really don't know. 
[02:50:30]  All I know is...  Because you were doing some great, great things.  And we're in radio, like, if someone like you came along, holy shit, we'd make sure you were taken care of.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, there were guys, sidekicks, that just did so much better than I did.  But I didn't think of myself as a sidekick.  I just thought of myself as a utility infielder.  But I was good at it.  And, you know, this weird soap opera kicked off about two months ago when some shitfuck took a quote of mine off my website and injected his own editorial. 
[02:51:00]  What was that quote?  What was the quote?  I was bitter about Stern.  And then he lobbed it into the New York Post as if he had talked to me.  And he put that I was bitter in there and it went to Richard Johnson.  And because of one scavenger, I wound up looking like a bag of dumb remarks.  Yeah, that same asshole has printed a lot of bullshit.  But, I mean, how can you get away with that, like, taking something that you read somewhere and saying that they told it to you and that he sounded this or that?  You're talking about Tracy Hayden?  Yeah.  Who just makes shit up? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  I'm a decent guy.  You know, I gave everything my all.  Yeah.  Millions of people happy for over a decade.  And still, no matter what the fuck you do, there will always be, like, 13 and a half people who hate you for some reason.  And, Billy, like I said, that was the golden age of that show.  And, you know, that was the you can't miss a day because you guys had something there and it was amazing.  I listened to the old tapes and I'm, like, going, oh, my God.  I don't even remember saying that.  All I knew was that I'd come out of there just kind of, like, questioning myself. 
[02:52:00]  Like, what the fuck did you just say?  You know?  Yeah.  Sometimes you listen to...  Most people got it.  People are smart.  They got it.  Yeah.  Would you ever go back to radio?  No.  I think for guys like you, you know, you're probably an anomaly.  You probably get a lot of money because you hung in there and, you know, you made it, you know?  Yeah, we're one of the lucky shows.  They're not going to bring a lot of radio shows to satellite, so we're lucky.  Not high profile, anyway, besides, you know, Howard. 
[02:52:30]  I mean...  I want a show.  You want a show?  That's right.  We got Saturday night here for you.  Oh, yeah?  It's 12 midnight.  We should talk.  Yeah, I know.  We could give you some time.  No problem.  I'd have a fun time, you know?  The great thing is you disappeared off of Howard's show, but then you just popped up everywhere  doing voiceover work.  Well, actually, I guess in this weird zen way, I have them to thank for just, you know,  refusing to up the ante because, you know, I really, I went to nothing.  I left and went to nothing. 
[02:53:00]  And that's against all what your uncles told you, you know?  Right.  Were you stupid?  Have something to back it up before you leave your asshole.  You got to make sure you got something lined up.  Yep.  You know, and then I have that work ethic because it was installed in me, you know, because  the immigrant mentality, you know?  Yeah.  You had a chance to work 18 hours a day and you didn't do it?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Yeah, and then all of a sudden you start hearing the Honey Nut Cheerio be, and I'm like, I think  that's Billy West.  Oh, yeah.  Honey Nut Cheerios, it's irresistible. 
[02:53:30]  There you go.  I'm a recycler.  I believe in recycling, you know, because I'm big on that with garbage and stuff.  Yeah.  But I used that voice on that show, Doug.  Right.  That was Nickelodeon Doug, and Doug was a painfully shy 11-and-a-half-year-old.  And this is my dog, Porkchop.  And this is the cash rolls in.  Hey, microphone, loser.  Hey, this is Roger Klotz, and I'm telling you, I'm the coolest guy on radio, and I got  to roll your radio to. 
[02:54:00]  What do you think about that?  He has the same voice.  And the cash rolls in.  That's great.  Well, you know what?  I got to tell you, radio is like kind of, you're a buyout, basically.  I know I always was because you don't really own anything, you know, that you did, and  you can't get residuals on it.  So it's kind of a license to print money.  And I think I was one of these guys that just said, wow, you know, residuals is what 
[02:54:30]  keeps people alive out here.  Yep.  You know, you don't hear from Terry Hatcher for years, and all of a sudden, you know,  bang, but she had to live somehow, and she got all those Superman residuals.  Oh, I do a Terry Hatcher impression.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Do these bones make me look fat?  You know, I just, I don't know, I love the residual thing, and I explained it to my mom's 
[02:55:00]  boyfriend.  He's an ex-firefighter, retired firefighter in Boston.  And one day I came over there, and he said, I want to know about show business.  He wants to know about everything about show business.  He thinks I'm like the president of show business.  Show business, yeah.  Not as close as anybody will ever get in that block.  But he would say, you know, I've got to ask you, Bill, what do you think is the best part  of your job?  Is it the people you work with?  Is it the hours?  You know, what is the best part of your job?  And I said, well, Walter, imagine you got on your robe and your slippers, and you got 
[02:55:30]  on the mailbox, and, you know, in it there's a check for a fire you fought in 1973.  And he just looked at me, and he goes, gotcha.  I said, I mean, it's still out.  It's still out.  It didn't come back.  He did a really good job.  You should be getting residuals for it.  That's a great way to put it.  Do you get really, really small paychecks in there as well, like for like $2.50, some  dumb little obscure thing you did? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, it's not like savings bonds, you know.  The more time goes on, the less they, you know, are valued.  And like the residuals just kind of wear down to nothing.  But that's okay, because, I mean, I get a work ethic.  I go out every single day, and if I'm not doing a gig, I'll be auditioning, because if  you want to work, you've got to audition.  What's the latest thing you've done, or that is coming out?  I recorded a pilot for television for George of the Jungle, kind of a different take on 
[02:56:30]  it.  I've done a million pilots.  See, they don't make cartoon shows anymore.  They just make a whole mess of pilots, and if one of them or two of them has emotional  resonance, then they'll make a show out of it.  Really?  Yeah, there's a whole part of this trying to ensure success thing that they don't have  quite down out here in stupid wood.  So you're also, well, Futurama, is that still going?  Yes, every place in the world, if you don't mind me telling you. 
[02:57:00]  I've got all this cool meat hanging out of my face.  Don't worry, get me a sandwich from the dumpster, and leave my maggots on it.  And I did, Professor Farnsworth, yeah.  Oh, good news, everyone, bad news.  That's so fantastic, man.  I think there was one more in there, but I can't remember.  That was my favorite show.  That was so hysterical, yeah. 
[02:57:30]  You've got to do bugs before you leave, man.  Well, let's see.  What did I get from Warner Brothers for doing that picture?  Oh, I got a million, and I got it out of them one carat at a time, Doc.  That must have been something, though.  All of a sudden, you're the voice of Bugs Bunny and Warner Brothers characters.  Yeah, it was great when every idiot that walked down the hallway pops their head in the door  while you're doing it and go, he's too much of a wise guy. 
[02:58:00]  And then another person will swing by 20 minutes later and pop their head in the door,  and he goes, he's too Jewish.  Oh, shit.  And then another idiot would come in and go, where's the tough guy, you know?  Yeah, that's got to be rough, because everybody is so familiar with that voice.  But, I mean, we're in radio.  We came from radio.  And our world was a sonic world more than visual.  Yeah.  Theater of the mind.  These people don't think like that.  They just have their own little perception of which ones they saw.  I mean, Bugs had a million incarnations, depending on the director. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  Which is, they're putting that out, too, Warner Brothers home video.  Oh, really?  Triple Threat of classic animation.  Yeah, it's the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, and I did some commentary on it.  It's got, like, all the best stuff on it and beautiful, pristine.  You know, because it's so funny.  We think that the Warner Brothers cartoons are playing constantly like when we were kids.  Yeah.  But they're not, and I think there's a whole mess of kids that are, like, six and up now  that don't really know who they are.  Yeah, not a clue. 
[02:59:00]  No, and you know what?  Cartoons were better then.  Then, I mean, it never occurred to me to burn down my own house.  No, I know.  When I was seven.  Yeah, for some reason they decided that some character, some animated animal hitting another  one with a frying pan was going to get kids to do that.  Oh, man, it got so bad in the 70s that there was this woman, Peggy Chair, in action for  children's television, and she had scenes deleted from Josie and the Pussycat because 
[02:59:30]  one of the girls threw her cat in a bowl of spaghetti.  And it was deemed very aggressive and very needless, so they cut out the scene because  they thought kids would throw their cat in a bowl of spaghetti.  I remember watching edited Wabbit Season, Duck Season, where they wouldn't show Elmer  shooting Daffy in the face with the gun.  They cut to some freeze frame of bugs looking out of his hole and then would cut back to  Daffy with his bill on his head.  It's like, what the fuck?  I remember that.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, you know, that's the worst thing you can do.  I mean, it's not even like colorizing a movie.  That, you've got a color and black and white button on your TV set.  Yeah, let's tap the joke right out of the cartoon.  At that point, don't...  Watch these politically correct surgeries of that joke.  Yeah, at that point, you should just not air it anymore.  Yeah, if you're going to butcher it like that, don't air it.  You know what it is?  Research and focus groups and all that other crap doesn't work.  It's a formula that was created by the business so that no one person is responsible for the 
[03:00:30]  decision to do something.  You know, they can say, hey, we did our research, we did the focus groups, and it just, you know,  it failed.  And then they invent new words for failure like deferred success.  Deferred success.  Yeah, that's the new one I heard out of Washington.  That's a great one.  I love that one.  I was a deferred success for quite a while.  I used to play music and I was kind of a bum, really.  So many years went by where cartoons and animation just sucked.  And then, like, and were just made for the smallest of children, you know, no more adults 
[03:01:00]  really watching it like we did growing up.  I still, you know, watched Bugs Bunny through my 20s and 30s and everything.  I doubt if you ever did anything like what was going on in those things.  You realize that this is, there are real live people that are responsible for the silly  stuff that's going on.  And you're more fascinated by that than the idea of how to find a new way to torture somebody.  Yeah, it had nothing to do with that.  You didn't do it.  It was just entertaining. 
[03:01:30]  It was funny.  You know, when kids started doing stuff, after we cut the good stuff out of cartoons and  we banished, you know, characters that had cigars and all of that crap, it started going  into Sesame Street, which I kind of loved.  I thought it was great whenever I got to see it.  But I didn't, I wasn't around in the 70s watching TV.  I was playing music.  Yeah.  So, um...  Goddamn hippie.  As soon as they started showing this Rainbow Brite and My Little Pony...  Oh, it was all that crap.  ...and Hammer Man and all that other shit. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Um, and you know what happened?  It's like that generation wound up to do drive-by shootings.  Yeah.  And killing their own kids.  I mean, the phenomena swept the country.  And I'm going, yeah, because you've got to get your rocks off on something that's just  out of your mind crazy on television.  Because then out of nowhere came, like, Beavis and Butthead and Ren and Stimpy, and all  of a sudden adults could watch cartoons again and laugh their asses off.  Well, you know what I liked so much about that time is that Ren and Stimpy, in no way, 
[03:02:30]  felt like The Simpsons, or looked like it.  And Beavis and Butthead, in no way, took any dynamic from Ren and Stimpy or The Simpsons.  No, and it was...  Really beautiful, stand-alone cartoon.  It had a 50s look to it, almost.  Yeah, kind of beat-nicky.  Yeah, yeah, Ren and Stimpy.  Well, I remember beat-nicks, because I'm 54 years old.  And it just had a great look and feel to it.  And the shock value out of a cartoon was, every episode was amazing like that. 
[03:03:00]  A lot of fun to watch.  Yeah, you know, there's more stuff coming, but I think computer is going to be the place  to go.  And I think, well, satellite radio is like the Wild West, ain't it, for you guys?  Yeah, that is.  So fucking lootly.  Every day we're trying to figure this thing out.  There's no law here.  That's right.  Yeah, you know what it is, you guys, I know you bounced around and you did the drill and  everything, but there's, like, I talk to a lot of these young, young disc jockeys, you  know, that are like, their voices crack when they're talking. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  You know, this is Booger with you.  You know, and I talk to these guys and say, we did everything because of you.  And I'm going, wow, you know, this is weird.  Like, Private Parts was a training film for these guys.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, you know, I always thought of Howard as, like, the first guy that ever  went to Acapulco, you know?  The first guy to ever go to Acapulco didn't have a good time.  You know what I mean?  He was like, you know, the bugs and the cracking the bushes open with a machete and, you know, 
[03:04:00]  getting bit by snakes and stuff.  And then 200 years later, there's a bunch of these young guys sitting on a beach in a  lounge chair going, hi, I'm Booger, you know.  I invented Acapulco, Robert.  And all the walls were broken down until now, which is this new frontier, which I'm totally  fascinated by.  I think it's great.  Yeah, it's a blast.  Here's a question, because I can't do any impressions at all.  Of all the, like, ones you do, like, what's the one that's, like, the one that you're like, 
[03:04:30]  fucking, I'm glad I can do that one?  Like, the most obscure or, like, hardest one?  Um, it depends on, you could take any voice and put it in the most absurd situation.  And I don't mean, like, the 80s stand-up comedy routine, like, you know, Jack Nicholson's  dog.  It might sound something like this.  Or, you know, that kind of stuff.  I mean, I liked when you took somebody and put them in, it's like, the comedians, the  old comedians used to hate the young comedians because they claimed these guys needed to 
[03:05:00]  work blue to be funny.  Meanwhile, those old guys were the dirtiest bastards in the world, if you ever hear outtakes  and roasts and stuff.  You know, and I used to say, man, it would be just so funny, I'd give anything to go back  and see, like, George Dice burns, you know?  So I'm standing in the bank line with my tongue up this chick's ass.  What else is that to do?  I'm George.  Never mind, Gracie.  Or, uh, you know, I came from the old days. 
[03:05:30]  I loved Bob Hope.  Yeah.  Hey, hi.  Hey, this is Bob Big Up from Heaven Hope.  Hey, how about that death?  Hey, this is Bob.  Who?  You know, they say that death is just a new beginning, and, hey, it might be a new beginning,  but I still look like the old ending.  I still carry my medical alert bracelet in case I fall down a flight of clouds.  Hey, how about that glaucoma? 
[03:06:00]  Cream in your coffee?  Squeeze it right in there, yeah.  Keep the motor running, boys.  These jokes are, uh, kind of ballin'.  Hey, speaking of radio, a lot of people are going to be a little bit of a little bit of a  radio, a lot of people are calling in saying you do a great Grishman.  Oh, well, yeah.  You know, he was one of those guys that, that kind of had that voice that Zap Brannigan wound  up doing.  Yeah.  And the thing is, is I knew Phil Hartman before he died.  He was, he was really cool.  When I was still in New York and I was up to nothing, you know, I just left, um, radio and 
[03:06:30]  I get this phone call.  My wife got the call, and I'm on my way home out of the belly of the beast, and I hear the  gates clang shut behind me.  And my wife calls me and says, you won't believe who I was talking to for like an hour.  I said, who?  She said, Phil Hartman.  He went on and on about how much he liked your stuff and how much he loved, you know.  And I said, hey, honey, you know, I know so many people that are capable of pulling an  elaborate joke like that. 
[03:07:00]  And then I got the phone number, I called him back, and it was him.  Wow.  And he says, you know, when are you going to come out to Hollywood?  You know?  Yeah.  So I'm like, geez, I don't know.  I, I, I really don't.  I, I had no, nothing planned to tell you the truth.  Um, but he was the nicest guy, the most generous guy as an actor and, you know, as a person  who would like talk to you and, you know, you didn't get that weird vibe from him.  It's so odd to have, because that's all I've heard about him are good things.  You never heard, you got like I was a prick and, uh, to have him have to fucking go out 
[03:07:30]  like that was awful.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  And the thing was, is Philip J. Fry on Futurama was named after Phil Hartman.  Really?  Yeah, and Zap Brannigan was going to be done by Phil Hartman.  So when people hear that, they go, oh, that's Billy doing Phil Hartman.  But you know what?  We talked about all that stuff before Futurama, and we both had that love of the big dumb announcers,  you know?  Yeah.  25, 30, 35 years ago. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, he used to do that.  You know, now kids hear those voices and they assume they're being lied to.  You know, hey, everybody.  One of the, one of the best, uh, SNL bits he was ever in was the one where he played the  doctor back in the fifties, where they were all smoking cigarettes.  Oh, yeah.  He tells the woman, uh, you have lung fever.  Yeah, smoke these.  You have lung fever.  Oh, my God.  Lung disease.  It reminded me of the avian flu pandemic.  You know, which I don't believe.  Of course not. 
[03:08:30]  A crock, you know.  60-something people.  I'm going to come along and turn your lungs into chip dip.  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  You know?  Yeah, 60-some-odd people have died worldwide and, uh, we're supposed to start panicking  now.  Yeah, really.  It hasn't killed anybody in Europe.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, the terror helicopters are flying around all night here in L.A.  Terror.  There's, there's a lot of terror.  There's just nothing but terror.  And I believe in an America where a man can, uh, come home after a hard day's work and 
[03:09:00]  be able to put food on his family.  And Rumsfeld's just as much of a dummy.  He's like, you know, things are more like they are now than they've ever been before.  What?  And Karl Rove, you can't see, but I've got both hands in front of my face and I'm mimicking  a blowjob, Karl Rove.  Oh, Billy, man, thanks for, uh, thanks for checking in. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, it's my pleasure.  I got a website.  I don't know if you guys ever went on it, but.  Plug away, my friend.  It's billywest.com.  It's real easy.  Oh, you were able to get that one?  Did you have to steal it?  Did you have to wrangle it from somebody?  Somebody tried to buy it and they were offering something and they were a carpet company.  You know, what?  I don't get that.  What is this, a new claim jumping, you know?  That's exactly what it is.  It's like, I, you know, my claim. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Someone comes up with a mule and a pickaxe and sits on your fucking name.  Yeah.  One day I was trying my 40 acres and a mule.  And I didn't get nothing.  So I'm going over to 7-Eleven and I'm going to get me a pussy book.  And then I'm going to get me a slurpee.  Hey, Billy.  And the pussy book is hot and the slurpee is cold.  Together they form weather.  Hey, Billy, you still do Marge shot or what?  Um, yeah, but that thing polarizes people, you know. 
[03:10:30]  It certainly does.  That's a good way to put it, polarizes.  I mean, even people who think it's funny in a certain situation try to act like, oh my  God, did you hear that?  Yeah.  And everybody pretty much got it, you know.  I mean, this is a grotesque send-up of a totally racist woman.  Right.  I'm not racist.  I mean, you know, I'm really not.  Who didn't get that, though, you know?  And we're doing this grotesque send-up of this woman, you know, like, who would barge  into the show and go, 80% of U.S. crime is committed by colored. 
[03:11:00]  All right, all right, Mrs. Shot, sit down.  I'm sorry, I meant niggas.  And then some white guy would call in and go, I think what you're doing is just really  terrible, and you're cutting away at the beautiful mosaic, which is New York, and it's people  like you.  I mean, your parents must be really proud of you, and I'd be like, ah, shit.  You know, and then a black guy would call in and go, I know that's Billy West. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  I know that's Billy West.  You know, laughing his bajongas off.  Yeah, some people just didn't understand.  You know, that's it.  Well, he's like a white guy, a sensitive white guy that thinks he's going to represent, like,  the African-American community.  Yeah.  I love that.  And they're laughing their asses off.  They can't say anything on their own.  Yeah, some people don't understand that it's, you know, a joke of, you know, you're doing  an impersonation, over-the-top impersonation of this woman who is known for saying some pretty 
[03:12:00]  awful things.  She did say really rank things.  I was, like, blown away by the stuff that she said.  I don't know what it is about radio.  When you're on TV or you're an actor in a movie, you could play the most heinous character  and it's fine.  They never say, like, wow, you're some racist when you were playing that part, you know.  But then on the radio, if you do some kind of character, people call up and it's like  you were just standing on a soapbox outside in the street blurting this shit out.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, they attack soap opera characters because people are fanatics. 
[03:12:30]  You know, they really believe that this guy on the show is like, you know, a double indemnity  murderer or something.  And they go up to them in the stores and go, how could you?  You know, it's just weird.  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah, but I mean, it's all to be fun, you know.  I mean, we don't, we're not like the government, you know, we're not promoting a culture of  death and destruction and torture.  You know, we represent, like, love and laughter and, you know, joy of some type. 
[03:13:00]  And I know that things get rough, but, I mean, it's the modern age.  We're not saying anything that anybody on the street everywhere USA or the world, you know,  isn't saying.  Right.  Never.  Yeah.  I mean, it's hard to reinvent language as much as they try, though, with that deferred success  shit.  Uh, Billy, I would have given you more money, but I'm out in the Hamptons.  You're what?  Tell him, tell him, Robin.  Oh, yeah.  I, uh, no, you know what? 
[03:13:30]  I wanted to pay you more, but, uh, I got to buy a house on the Hamptons.  I don't know.  He didn't, you know, I had no idea, like, where he was on all that stuff.  But out here, it's really bad.  It's so snobby.  And when I first got here, I'd go to my first Hollywood party, and I figured, I'm going  to make sure I have some $100 bills on me.  Yeah.  You know, so when I go to buy a Red Bull.  Pull that out.  I was like, oh, hey, look at this guy.  And I hand the guy $100, and he goes, ooh, do you have anything bigger? 
[03:14:00]  So you've got to have money, somehow.  Absolutely.  All right, Billy.  BillyWest.com.  Billy, uh.  I really appreciate it, you guys.  Great, man.  I've followed your career, and, uh, and I, I'm glad I got to talk to you.  And if you're in New York, uh, pop in.  Yes, I do.  Love to have you on here live.  How about that?  All right.  Cool, man.  All right.  Take it easy.  All right.  Yeah, bit with the air, bit with the air.  That's all for air, folks.  There he goes, Billy West.  Thanks, Billy.  Bye.  That was great.  All right, we're going to take a break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[03:14:30]  We got audio from the latest assaults on the media.  We got more audio from, uh, the Black Rock Coalition.  We didn't get to half the show we wanted to today, but, uh, I think that's a sign we  had a pretty good show, right?  Dude, that was a great Tony Soprano.  No one does Tony Soprano.  I know.  I know.  That was a lot of fun.  A lot of insight, too.  And Jim Norton is back in town for the next two weeks.  He's, uh, playing Caroline's Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Wednesday through Saturday.  Uh, one or a couple of the shows already sold out, so you should, uh, 212-757-4100 is the  Caroline's number. 
[03:15:00]  Call.  We have a loser from The Apprentice on the show.  We found out that she, uh, had a kid at 16 years old.  We got pregnant at 16 years old, and, uh, the interview was, uh, kind of boring.  So, uh, so I popped in and played Mr. Asshole today, and it got very, very, very uncomfortable.  They didn't send you off to some, uh, place to have the baby and tell all the neighbors that  she's just at boarding school.  They, they whited out her part of the will. 
[03:15:30]  No, they really didn't.  And I was a great example to my community.  I mean, I stood up, and I took a-  You're a kid, and I did.  Yeah.  Yep.  I hear ya.  All right.  Well, that's, uh, I, that's actually a pretty good way the story could have ended up.  Because it could have ended, uh, uh, worse.  Right, Opie?  That's my partner, uh, Opie.  Opie.  We call him Opie the Asshole sometimes here on, uh, on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:16:00]  Works out very well.  You, you, you, you gonna watch the show?  Do you think you know who's gonna win?  No, I'm gonna continue to watch.  I have a lot of great friends on there.  All right.  Uh, here's Donald Trump with his, uh, famous catchphrase.  All right.  Let's hear what he said.  The red button, Opie.  Oh, okay, this one.  Christy, you really got a tough edge, and you can cause a lot of problems.  This is not a popularity contest, but you're just too difficult to work with. 
[03:16:30]  You're a distraction to the team.  Christy, you're fired.  Wow, that's just gotta suck to hear, huh?  Yeah, it does.  You were one of the strong players.  You were a threat, so they had to boot you.  I like it that, I like it said that way.  That's good.  Yay!  There you go.  Well, why don't we leave on that high note?  All right.  Okay, great.  Hey, Christy, thanks for being on the show today.  Continued success to you.  Thank you.  And, uh, good luck.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Thank you. 
[03:17:00]  You are ass.  Did you hear the slam?  Oh, I know.  She is pissed.  That was most...  I could hear it in her voice.  She did not want to be on that phone when she picked up the phone.  Just because of what we were talking about with Patty, and she overheard it when she was  on hold.  And then it just went downhill.  And you...  Oh, my God.  Have you ever played the You're a Filthy Whore clip while I'm trying to conduct an interview?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's just...  You're a Filthy Whore!  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[03:17:30]  That was very cool to have Billy West on the program today.  He was being very diplomatic, by the way.  Very obvious. 
[03:18:00]  Well, you gotta keep, uh...  I noticed the L.A. people, they like keeping all their doors open.  Yeah.  All the, uh, windows of opportunity.  Always left open.  They never bash anyone anymore.  Right, Jim?  Hey, I don't know what they do.  Howard screwed them.  It's very obvious.  Because someone is becoming a little too big on his radio show.  If it's about money, and you have someone like Billy West on your show, just killing, 
[03:18:30]  making your show unbelievably funny, and he asks management for money, and they don't give  it to him, and you have the power to...  You have Mel's ear, you have his home phone number, you call him up and go, this guy is  making my show great.  Pay him what he wants.  You know what they do?  They pay him.  That's how it works.  He doesn't go to bat for anyone.  Jackie, same thing.  Boyd Gary, the, uh, you know, executive producer of the show there, he still has to do bar gigs.  Fucking bar gigs that guy is doing. 
[03:19:00]  He still has to do bar gigs.  He still has to go out there and deal with pests putting WOW stickers on his back during  photo ops.  That's right.  Which is just hysterical.  He still has to deal with that shit because Howard won't pay him.  You see what they do to him now at these bar gigs?  All these fucking pests go out.  They get around him for a photo op and he's smiling, and right when the guy snaps the picture,  they pull out WOW signs and WOW stickers and shit.  Yeah.  And snap.  There you go, Howard.  A guy that made your show really, really good over the years.  You still don't pay him.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  The guy that organizes everything.  Jackie Martling, same thing.  The guy was there from the, from just about the start on the old NBC days.  And the guy helped build that show into what it became.  And what does he get?  I'd like a little more money.  Eh, it's management's problem, Jackie.  Go to, go to management.  Yeah.  You're the guy that could go to management and absolutely get Jackie the money he wanted.  But where was Howard in that fucking negotiation?  The only one he pays is the one that shouldn't get anything.  And believe me, that isn't speculation. 
[03:20:00]  The only one he pays is Robin, who's the most useless part of the show.  The hole?  Yeah.  Because she's never going to, you know, outshine Howie.  Oh.  She's just going to sit there.  Oh, stop.  And giggle from her dunking booth.  You guys have always gone about for me with money.  Seriously.  Oh, we know that, actually.  I mean, I have to make that public record.  Whether we should or not.  I'm not saying it was a bright move.  Believe me, that could have been better spent, dumbasses.  But she had fun paper.  You know, a lot of people picked up on the fact that when Billy West was on the phone, 
[03:20:30]  I go, man, when a guy like you comes along, you've got to hire him immediately.  Do you think they picked up and I said, Billy, this phone call is inspirational?  Yeah.  Of course.  But no, but you know what?  You have.  You guys have taken great care of me.  I've never had a financial complaint.  All right.  You need to be cared for.  Oh, you.  Like a little lost lamb.  I'm not.  Let's get some stuff done.  The assault on the media contest.  Yes.  It's really, really heating up for the month of November.  Every month we do this contest.  You want to explain it really fast, Anthony?  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  You got them live shots on the news.  You watch the news.  You're always going now to our reporter in blah, blah, and they're standing there in front  of some building where there was a fire or a street where there was an accident or whatever.  They do a stand-up, they call it, and the reporter's right out there live.  But your job is to assault the media.  It's to get behind the reporter during that live shot.  In front of the reporter.  Just getting on camera.  Still, there's a lot of pests out there not brave enough to go in front of the reporter.  In front of the reporter.  I guess that would be a real big move.  That's the big move.  You think it is?  That's the move.  And to just stay there. 
[03:21:30]  Just block the reporter completely and just talk into the camera.  Yeah.  O&A, Party Rock, whatever you want to say.  But they get behind the reporter with a sign, stickers, if it's very quickly thrown together.  But we love the big signs.  And yell, Opie and Anthony, XM202.  That's your assault on the media.  That's how it works.  There have been quite a few.  Every month we get more and more.  Yep.  What are we up to now?  We've got a lot for this month.  Three more came in over the weekend.  Yeah, three more came in over the weekend. 
[03:22:00]  And basically, one rule, do not touch the reporter.  Yeah, just don't touch the reporter.  Use air horns, use costumes, do whatever you have to.  That's all you've got to do.  Jump up and down, get our attention, and every month we declare a winner.  This month the prizes are great, and we're adding to it every day.  It's unbelievable.  I didn't even know this.  The prizes for the Assault on the Media Contest for November.  One Nintendo DS handheld gaming system with Mario Kart DS.  Ooh.  Very cool.  Jaeger has given us just a million prizes. 
[03:22:30]  Jaegermeister.  You get a guitar.  You get amps.  You get guitar cases, and you get four pairs of tickets and VIP passes to be in the Jaegermeister  VIP area and meet the bands Disturbed and Corrosion of Conformity when they come to your town.  Mm-hmm.  And then you get a portable MiFi radio with a free subscription.  You get dinner with E-Rock at Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  E-Rock optional.  And of course, finally, admission to the Opie and Anthony Show Studios to watch the show 
[03:23:00]  of your choice.  Unbelievable how many prizes there are for November's contest.  I remember when we had none prizes.  And the Paisano still did it.  Yes.  Still did it.  Has anyone turned you down yet, Eric?  Or no?  They've all accepted E-Rock?  Have you gone to dinner with any of the Assault on the Media winners?  No, not yet.  No.  Not yet.  Okay.  They have not opted for the Hawk joining them for dinner.  Jesus.  One did?  You undercarriage wash.  You want to go for the undercoat.  Can I have more cereal, Hawk? 
[03:23:30]  What kind of cereal's up there?  Let's say...  Oh, the True Coat's pretty good on those cars.  Let's say hi to Peter on Long Island.  Hey, listen, guys.  I'm telling you.  I love you guys.  You guys are so talented.  It's unbelievable.  Hello, sweet cheek.  Hello, angel.  But I got to tell you, the knocking of Howard is driving me crazy.  You guys have more class than that.  No, we don't.  No, they don't.  No, we don't.  Let me get my piece out.  I'll listen to you guys.  Go ahead.  You can kill me when I get done.  Get your piece out.  We were going to move on from the Howard thing, but now you're calling in to talk about it.  See, you're prolonging it, sir.  So now we have to talk about it.  We talked about it for three seconds. 
[03:24:00]  I go to your shows.  I go everywhere.  You guys know me, even.  We'll talk about that later.  Listen, Peter.  No, we will not talk about that later.  There will be no discussion.  You guys are that good.  The reality is we do a four-hour talk show every day.  Today, we might have spent five minutes on it.  Right.  You knock him every single session.  And we'll knock him every single day until he retires, that scumbag who treated us like shit.  And who has never helped anyone in this business except himself.  It's all about fucking him.  He had talent like Billy West that he let go because Billy was becoming funnier than him. 
[03:24:30]  And we want to expose him for the fraud he really is.  Hey, Pete.  Guys, if you love Jimmy, he's the greatest.  If Jimmy wanted $3 million, there'd be a decision to make there.  It wasn't no $3 million.  I'm not saying that's a number.  We just need to give Jimmy a $5,000 raise and he was happy.  And let me tell you something.  For the fucking four or five years of bullshit that we ought to put up with behind the scenes because of that fucking cocksucker,  if we take three minutes every day to bash him, it's going to take a million years to cover the same amount of time. 
[03:25:00]  So you fucking deal with it, Peter.  But I love your show, but when you start...  Peter.  Get up.  Peter, there's so many channels on XM.  When we do that, you go somewhere else for a while.  I go somewhere else for three minutes.  There's other stuff we do.  Like, you know, I got email from people like, hey, I love the show, but when Billy was smelling the homeless hooker's ass,  I couldn't listen, so I went to another channel for a while.  That's what happens.  If you guys didn't have the...  More people want to hear us talk about Howard and what a fraud and a hypocrite he is...  Three minutes.  ...than don't. 
[03:25:30]  Three minutes we talked about it.  We had Billy West on the fucking show.  We had Billy West on the show, who was on Howard's show for fucking years when it was actually entertaining to listen to.  We're not supposed to bring it up?  Just shut up.  Shut your yip.  Shut your yip.  Shut your yip.  Shut your yip.  Shut your yip.  Shut your yip.  Okay, listen.  Shut your yip.  Shut your yip.  Shut your yip.  I sell.  Shut up.  I'm Dr. Compton.  Shut up.  It looks bad.  What are you people, on dope?  You dick. 
[03:26:00]  You dick.  You dick.  I'm a dick.  I'm a dick?  You dick.  You dick.  Listen, I don't care what you say.  I love you guys.  All right, Peter.  Shut up.  All right, listen.  Peter made his point.  There you go.  Watch you.  There you go.  I love you.  Goodbye.  All right.  Could he please instant feedback me so I can ban him?  No, I like Peter, actually.  I hate him.  He's just giving his opinion.  It's fine.  His opinion stinks.  You know, we think it's the right thing to do. 
[03:26:30]  Howard was such a complete cock behind the scenes and a crybaby that we have to expose him for that shit.  No one knows.  That's what it is.  You don't understand, asshole.  You don't understand what it was like to sit there for four years and on a daily basis, yes, daily basis, get harassed by that motherfucker behind the scenes.  And we're going to expose him and we're going to slowly but slowly...  At every turn.  He erode his credibility.  Chip, chip, chip.  At every turn, you'll hear us chip, chip, chip away at that asshole. 
[03:27:00]  And wherever he is in public, we will be there.  No problem.  Speaking of which, Doug Outdog, I got something for you.  Oh.  Mission?  Well, you know what?  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  We got to smuggle some weapons to the pests.  Ah, okay.  And the special ops.  I got some ideas for the next few Howie appearances.  We're on tear.  Yes.  If you want to join the O&A Army, go to whackbag.com. 
[03:27:30]  I'm eating a lot of cereal today, guys.  I apologize for the noise.  I don't give a fuck, Jimmy.  How many bowls?  I don't know how to control.  You are a mad person.  This is a bowl of cereal.  I see that.  There's three cereal boxes in front of him.  Three.  There's a bowl, a paper bowl that's now soggy because he's refilled it five times.  All right, listen.  I'm trying this cereal with the fucking interracial couple on a stick.  You're eating the good friends?  We were joking about that awful cereal.  That's the only reason it's here. 
[03:28:00]  It was a joke.  You're eating a prop.  That's a prop we had from a goofing the other day.  This cereal should be called fucking emaciated race pair.  Good friends.  One side of the cereal is darker than the other.  I love how you're hosing down the black side of the cereal with the milk right now.  Jesus.  It should be called good friends who take care of your dog on your bad days.  It looks like Florence Henderson and some fucking Hawaiian. 
[03:28:30]  I don't like this Hawaiian.  No, that guy is a little of everything.  He's black.  He's Hawaiian.  He's some Asian in there, which is, I guess, Hawaiian, too.  Who knows?  A little of everything.  It should be called my good friends.  Don't talk to me anymore since I went out with this guy.  Too bad.  I love that cereal.  Too bad you don't see the gun right outside that shot that was taken to make her smile like that.  This fucking cereal is so bad.  It's making me angry.  Oh, you're eating it.  See?  Any of that Kashi shit. 
[03:29:00]  No.  No, it's awful and shut up.  It's good.  No.  I like it.  It's not sugar-frosted flakes.  The puffed wheat rip-off cereal is good from Kashi?  Or Kashi?  Kashi or Kashi?  This is fucking the worst thing I've ever heard.  Can I have a bottle of water from somebody and kiss?  No.  Jimmy, he brought in a cereal called Lean on Me the other day, and it had a picture of  a woman on a scale in a leotard on her tippy toes.  Oh, he bought that cereal.  All right, listen. 
[03:29:30]  That is a woman's estrogen-filled cereal.  It should have had a cock on it, and it should have been called Kneel in Front of Me.  Don't make me break down the ninth wall here.  The ninth wall?  I took a beating because of that stupid cereal last week, but there's a picture of Anthony  leaning on the box, not me.  Because I wanted to show what a guy eating that would look like.  People don't listen closely enough.  Now they think you're eating the Lean on Me cereal.  No, no, no.  And I'm going to now, you know, tear down the ninth wall.  That is me in character.  I did not officially buy that cereal. 
[03:30:00]  Oh.  Didn't matter.  See, I'm starting to tear down the wall every day now.  Opie.  Because last week, everyone thought I didn't pay the homeless woman.  I did when the mics were off.  Opie.  Tear down the wall and say you did not buy that cereal.  That's fine.  I swear to God.  I honestly believe it.  I will go on record and say I know for a fact Opie did not buy Lean on Me.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you.  The problem is, you had no problem bringing it here into the studio in front of everybody.  Which means you saw no problem with it. 
[03:30:30]  Even though you didn't buy it.  After 11 years, you're starting to figure out that I don't really give a shit what people think of me.  Well, I know that.  I don't give a crap.  And I didn't bring it in for a prop because I was throwing it.  I know you didn't.  I was throwing it.  That would have been funny.  I was throwing the box away thinking I was getting, you know, not even getting away with it.  No.  The box was empty.  I'm like throwing it away just before the show.  And Bill Burr noticed I was throwing it away.  Is there a gayer cereal?  Bill Burr.  No.  Jesus. 
[03:31:00]  All right.  Can we go back to the audio of this?  How about a box of Robert Reed Flakes?  Robert Reedios.  They kind of look like Cheerios, but they're actually an ass chase on either side of the hole.  A little blood.  Why?  I apologize.  Why do I have to do that?  All right.  I had a gag the other day you weren't here, but now I've got to tell you.  It's the Robert Reed cereal.  It's like alphabets, but only H, I's, and V's.  Did you say that?  Did you say Robert Reed cereal?  I swear to God, I didn't hear you say that. 
[03:31:30]  I believe so.  I did not hear you say that.  Wow.  No, of course you didn't.  That's what I'm saying.  But the H, I's, and V's.  That would be a fun cereal, right?  What is this spelling?  Vi-ha.  No.  I-h-h-v.  No.  Oh, I get it.  All right.  We got the audio from the Assault on the Media contest.  Deus.  Said.  What is this?  I don't understand.  All right.  Back to the Assault on the Media. 
[03:32:00]  So three more came in over, uh, over the weekend.  We'll start with the, uh, Fox 5.  Fox 5 reporter James Ford in Belmar, New Jersey.  Uh, and it was John from New Jersey, a fat kid.  Uh-huh.  Who had a, uh, a very casual conversation with the reporter as he's trying to do a live report.  He got angry.  Uh, listen to this.  Well, we'll just show it to you.  We're here on Ocean Avenue in Belmar.  And you may notice there's a lot of sand here on Ocean Avenue.  Yeah, and look over here. 
[03:32:30]  You got small drifts here on Ocean Avenue.  Again, this is a street.  Ocean Avenue, that is the actual ocean.  And what's happened here is we've had such strong winds all day long that the sand from the beach is all blown into town.  And that's just the beginning of things.  On top of that, we've had very low temperatures and very heavy rain.  Is that like radio?  Well, they cut him off right at that point.  Wow.  He just looked at them.  It's a visual. 
[03:33:00]  You got to go to the, uh, website and look.  Go to the website and check out the latest videos from the Assault on the Media Contest because that one is definitely a better video.  Some of them are much better, uh, video-wise than they are audio-wise.  Because you see the fat kid in the background kind of just milling about.  Yeah, and then he just walks up to him and goes,  Do you listen to Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio?  The guy's doing a report.  Yeah, here he is, the little, little fat gentleman.  Hey, uh, Tim and PA, what's up?  Hey, uh, I wanted to ask Opie, uh, what he thought about Fez's, uh, little rant there Friday. 
[03:33:30]  And by the way, I love you guys, I love your show.  He's got my XM this year, and awesome, awesome show.  Uh, thanks.  We're gonna, we're gonna do an end-of-the-year special that's gonna be just absolutely terrific.  Can I be on it?  I've had it all year, but I just want to know what you thought about Fez's little rant there Friday.  You know what, a lot of people are asking me about that.  I still haven't officially heard the audio, so, uh, how about we do that tomorrow on the show?  Oh, you gotta hear it, man.  I guess Fez is blaming me for his heart attack.  No, he's got, he's got a list.  He's thanking you for his heart attack. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, okay.  And he didn't thank Anthony, because he thinks he's an adopted cumulus.  He's got a, uh, he's got a list.  And, uh, you seem to be on the list.  Along with people like, uh, Harry, and, uh, Paul, and a bunch of other people.  He's thanking him for the heart attack.  Alright, Tim, can you call the show tomorrow and remind us so we can play that, because we're gonna forget overnight.  Uh, I'll definitely remind you.  Alright, cool.  Tim?  Bye.  Tim.  Fuck.  Click.  What happened?  I don't know, Opie.  Did he get scared?  You wanted him to keep talking. 
[03:34:30]  You were gonna go, Tim, but what about...  I get scared.  Alright, the second assault of the media that, uh, came in over the weekend.  CBS 4 here in New York.  Oh, no, this was Massachusetts getting involved.  Okay.  Sorry.  CBS 4 in, uh, Massachusetts.  Pauline Chow.  Or Chow.  C-H-I-O-U.  D-I-N-Y.  C-H-I-O-U.  Chow.  Chow.  Chow.  Chow.  Chow.  Chow.  Chow. 
[03:35:00]  Chow.  Chow.  Chow.  Chow.  Chow.  Yeah, she really should be throwing a, a fucking exploding hat into a helicopter.  Pointy hat.  Uh, Mike from, uh, Drakeit, Massachusetts, uses a spotter as indicated by cell phone in  Mike's hand.  Uh-huh.  Videos are up on opiananthony.com.  Here's the audio of this assault on the media.  He is not charged with manslaughter.  He is charged with drunk driving, not vehicular manslaughter just yet.  Sources tell CBS4 the prosecution is having a hard time right now placing this person behind 
[03:35:30]  the wheel at the time of the...  Yeah, the sticker, that was a very good impromptu assault.  Did they cut away too before she finished?  Because the audio just ends there.  It moves to the side.  It moves to the side.  That was pretty good too, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  And then finally, getting to the big one, uh, No Filter Paul, who's on the line.  Again.  Again.  No Filter Paul.  Good morning, boys.  This is your fourth assault on the media for the month of November alone, right? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Sonny's not beating me.  Well, Sonny Ferrelli has the title right now.  He won for September and October, I believe.  Yes.  So the, uh, the title's up there in, uh, Massachusetts, and, uh, No Filter Paul is trying to bring  it home to New York.  Yep.  Playing for the New York team.  Gotta do it.  Or Jersey, officially, right?  Yeah.  They're one market, pretty much, for the radio, so that's one team.  Well, No Filter Paul's definitely in the lead with the one where he made the report, just  give up on the report and walk away.  And No Filter Paul, and, uh, who else was with you? 
[03:36:30]  Uh, this one was Chester's Ashes and XM Era.  No, no, I mean the, uh, the one I was just explaining.  Oh, that was Mike, Assault on the Media guy from the Hollywood.  Yeah, Mike.  So they're left there on live TV just jumping up and down like lunatics because the reporter  gave up her post.  That video's up on opianathony.com as well.  There's a whole, uh, Assault on the Media section now on opianathony.com to make it easy.  So you guys hit, uh, CNN, another national hit.  Yep.  CNN, uh, headline news, actually, yep.  Yeah, and, uh, you guys come running into the shot with the big opianathony, uh, signs. 
[03:37:00]  It was a great assault on the Media, and then you got, uh, yanked out of the, uh, the shot,  right?  Oh, yeah.  The, uh, first of all, the sound guy yanked my sign out of my hand, and then right after  that, the guy from the truck just grabbed my collar and pulled me back.  Yeah.  Yeah, and we have behind-the-scenes video of that, the film by Big A.  Yeah, what's great about this video, when you see it online, you see the actual assault  that everyone saw on TV, and then it, uh, it segs into the behind-the-scenes footage  that you guys shot.  Right.  And it's, uh, it's well, well done.  Big A was, uh, holding the camera. 
[03:37:30]  What happened, Paul?  Hey, he hung up on you.  Oh, he's right now panicking.  I swear to God.  Oh, no, what happened?  There's an accident.  All right, well, we'll play the audio as he calls back.  So it's, uh, no filter Paul hitting CNN with a bunch of guys.  David is live in New York City's Times Square.  David, are the fans that side themselves with excitement?  You know, Brooke, the, uh, Harry Potter fans are very much like Star Trek fans.  They will do just about anything for the film itself. 
[03:38:00]  Another dishonest fucking reporter.  He's trying to make believe these were, uh, Harry Potter fans.  Harry Potter fans?  Stop it.  He couldn't even, uh, uh, continue.  He, he kind of stopped, turned around, looked.  Yeah.  And that's when somebody from the truck, I guess, came out and pulled Paul by the collar.  Another great, uh, video.  More, a better video than audio, obviously.  But, uh, Paul, walk us through it.  What else happened there? 
[03:38:30]  Well, actually, the guy went live one time before, and we made the mistake of having Big  A on the phone.  Yeah.  With, with Doug at Doug.  Yeah.  And he stumbled so badly trying to tell us it was live.  It was already over before.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  He's like, live.  We'll, live, live Times Square.  And we're like, yeah, we're in Times Square.  Meanwhile, we just missed a shot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All he had to say was go, and he couldn't get it out.  No.  Not at all.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[03:39:00]  Nelly.  For sure.  And we wanted him to come over to us when the truck guy was shouting at us, but he walked  further away because he was scared the cops were getting caught or something.  Further away.  How do you walk further?  Further.  It's the opposite of nearer.  He walked further away.  Yeah.  It was a lot of fun, though.  A lot of fun.  Paul, there's only about a week or two, what, ten days left in, not even, whatever, a 
[03:39:30]  little over a week left in the contest, and I don't think anyone's going to beat  you this month.  I'm not counting Sonny out.  Sonny always comes, actually, Sonny pulls it out of the list.  Late.  Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.  I think he did that last month.  He pulled it out late, so.  Yeah.  It was the last day, like 7 p.m.  Yeah, there you have it.  All right.  Well, Paul, thanks again.  Right, and if you guys are serious about us doing a weekend show, we've got a whole  list of things we want to try.  Well, you guys come up with your best show idea.  I already said, Antony, the list a couple of minutes ago, so I don't know if you saw  it yet.  Oh, great. 
[03:40:00]  Who did you send it to?  I sent it to Antony.  I didn't send it to Steve until I wanted to hear from you guys that you were serious.  Let me see.  Here is the prep sheet.  Do not read the whole thing on the air, please.  Why?  Why?  Well, it's good, but I'd like to surprise a little bit, you know?  Surprise.  Yeah, all right, whatever.  Hour one.  You know what?  You're live on the show right now.  What do you want to do on this channel on the weekend?  Well, we've got a bunch of ideas.  You know, we're going to have Ask the Hall.  People can ask Denise questions.  Okay.  Yeah, wonderful.  The BET Minute, where I just turn on BET and comment on what's on the screen. 
[03:40:30]  Okay.  Oh, Paul watches BET and comments on what he sees.  All right.  It doesn't matter what time.  The Mystery Science Theater with racism thrown in.  Have people call up that maybe want to have sex with Big A. We just want, you know, care  if it's a guy or a girl.  Okay.  Spot the fake orgasm.  Play some dirty Christmas songs.  Yep, there you go.  I know, I know.  Have people call up and say why they should, you know, do the next weekend.  Cutting a golden ticket type thing.  No, you don't need to do that. 
[03:41:00]  We'll figure that shit out.  All right.  Gossip from the message boards.  I have all of other message boards.  Chemistry said he's going to do the intros and sweepers for us, and he's going to let  us play a song from his new CD that he's working on.  So who does the show?  Me, Denise, and Big A. And then we have guests.  Whoever.  Whoever wants to call him.  What do you guys think?  At least he planned something out.  Yeah, he planned something out.  If he blows one week, then, you know, whatever.  What do you guys think?  Give him two hours Saturday at midnight?  I would say, if not November 23rd through 26th, the Carolines, definitely give him two 
[03:41:30]  hours.  I'll give him two hours this weekend.  All right.  What else are we doing on the weekend?  Two hours.  We'll chat about it next week.  Pretty hard to fill.  Yeah, we'll have to get all the audio so we can goof on it on our show.  For sure.  For sure.  So Saturday night at midnight, I got to check with good old Elo, but it'll be Big A, me  and Filter Paul, and Denise.  Yep.  Just shooting the shit.  And Jimmy, we'll have to come to your show Friday because you're still going to be on 
[03:42:00]  when we're on.  We're going to have people call in from your show as well.  Oh, yeah.  Come Friday, man.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right.  Let's think it over, and we'll have an answer tomorrow for you.  That sounds positive.  It is good, actually.  No, it's not a bad idea.  Elo don't tell us nothing.  We tell him.  To be honest, we just want very raw shit on the weekend.  That's what we're looking for.  We're not looking for polished shows because...  I just didn't want to call up and say, okay, we're going to do two hours and have nothing.  These are just some ideas.  I want some stuff where you're listening going, this is a fucking train wreck. 
[03:42:30]  Right.  Well, you know, another thing we have here is have Big A keep drinking and see if he speaks  normally after X number of beers.  So that might be a train wreck.  Maybe you might want to not do that.  Okay.  Well, I don't know the rules.  You guys have to pretty much put them up.  All right.  Thank you.  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  Big A keep drinking show. </pre>
