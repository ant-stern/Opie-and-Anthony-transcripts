<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie recounting his frustrating search for his missing phone, which he’d left in the SiriusXM bathroom and later found exactly where he'd left it.  The conversation then shifted to Jim Norton’s appearance on Hannity, featuring anecdotes about Norton’s phone disrupting the broadcast and Greta Van Susteren's interview with Blagojevich.  Norton's dismissive comment about Rush Limbaugh was discussed, leading into a tease of Anthony’s new nickname for President Obama and a mention of an Obama rap song created from one of Anthony's rants.  A lengthy segment followed, debating the IMDb Top 250 movies, with *Shawshank Redemption*, *Pulp Fiction*, *The Dark Knight*, *Raging Bull*, and *Slumdog Millionaire*  receiving particular attention, including a discussion of *Slumdog Millionaire*'s portrayal of Indian poverty.  The contrast between the continued success of figures like Sean Penn and Roman Polanski versus those who faced downfall for offensive language was also explored. A caller briefly mentioned E-Rock's hot wings, prompting a digression on a disastrous Super Bowl party and a discussion of the upcoming Super Bowl and Andy Pettitte's Yankee contract, along with the hosts' perceived lack of enthusiasm for the game.  The segment concluded with a musical teaser and further promotion of the Obama rap song.

The next segment began with another humorous anecdote about a disastrous Super Bowl party, specifically the hosts' clandestine disposal of E-Rock's chicken wings.  The conversation quickly turned to nicknames for President Obama, with one host suggesting “Barack Hussein,” followed by the airing of a listener-submitted, explicit rap song, "Barack's Gonna Take Ant's Money," satirizing the hosts' anxieties about Obama's policies.  Studio guest Louis C.K. then joined the show, discussing his GM stock investments, an upcoming benefit show, and his negative experiences with insensitive female callers on other radio shows, who derailed his comedic bits with irrelevant comments.  Louis C.K.'s upcoming stand-up special was promoted, along with his views on *Slumdog Millionaire* and *The Wrestler*.  The segment concluded with Jim Norton mentioning an email from Ann Coulter and discussing their relationship, incorporating sexually explicit statements and offensive jokes.

The following segment, also with Louis C.K. present, began with a discussion on free speech and criticism of figures like Rush Limbaugh and Don Imus.  The hosts then transitioned to promoting Louis C.K.'s show at Caroline's and discussed the perceived slow news day and their cynical view of the Super Bowl. The conversation turned to New York City's homeless population, with one host recounting a bizarre encounter with a homeless man.  The segment continued with anecdotes about interactions with celebrities, including Martin Sheen, Rip Torn, and Eve, focusing on the challenges and absurdities of working with difficult personalities.  The hosts then criticized Citibank's purchase of a private jet after receiving a government bailout, sparking a broader discussion on corporate greed, socialism, and corporate irresponsibility.  The conversation shifted to the anxieties of parenthood, particularly concerning daughters' safety, with Louis C.K. contributing his perspective.  The segment concluded with a review of Paul O's film "Gap," including discussions of his personal life and past appearances on the Ron and Fez show.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a detailed, chaotic review of Paulo's low-budget horror film, "Gap," with Louis C.K. providing commentary.  The hosts discussed Paulo's past legal troubles (vaguely referencing a conviction involving minors without specifics), his ex-wife's death (which he attributed to a drug overdose following an accident, a claim the hosts questioned), and his current relationship. The film itself was described as experimental and unconventional, featuring shaky camera work, changing aspect ratios, low-quality visuals, non-professional actors, nudity, and implied violence.  The hosts and Louis C.K. criticized the film's technical aspects and coherence, interspersed with playing clips from the film and numerous interruptions.  The film's marketing strategy, potentially involving a pyramid scheme, was also discussed.  An AshleyMadison.com commercial break occurred during this segment.

The final segment featured "No Filter Paul," another filmmaker, presenting his low-budget horror film.  The hosts and Louis C.K. provided a merciless critique of the film's poor production quality, acting, and plot. Specific examples of poor execution were highlighted, including inadequate duct tape, incorrect use of a prop knife, and an actor seemingly falling asleep during a murder scene.  No Filter Paul explained the low budget was intentional and described a marketing strategy involving self-harm stunts tied to sales milestones, culminating in an intern defecating on his head, as outlined by his "life coach," Dr. Machine Gun. The segment, filled with vulgar language and sexually explicit humor, featured frequent mention of the film's website, GabTheMovie.com, with promo code RonFez, and concluded with promotional plugs for DirecTV and ProFlowers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  And it starts with a good morning.  There it is. The wake the hell up music.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  Oh my god. 
[00:00:30]  I want to finish one storyline.  We start a lot of stories on this radio show.  Yeah.  And you've got to give updates and you've got to finish stories, storylines.  And then you start new ones and other ones just kind of float out there for a while.  But in the end everything gets answered, right?  Yeah, if you listen long enough on this show.  I hold in my hand my missing phone.  There it is.  I hold in my hand my missing phone.  If you were listening yesterday, I went off just a little bit on the fact that someone stole my phone when I went off over to Sirius XM on Friday. 
[00:01:00]  It was quick.  If you weren't listening for the whole show, you might have missed it.  You didn't catch it if you were listening between 7 and 7 or 8.  But any other time you were listening, you may have caught it.  You may have caught it.  Yeah.  You handled it well, though.  I think you handled it well.  You weren't too over the top of it.  I was a mental patient.  Well, you were fine.  I lost my effing mind.  A lot of people threaten to burn down a 45-story building when your phone is missing. 
[00:01:30]  Of course.  And if you weren't listening yesterday, I went into the bathroom, I put my phone down, I did my business, and I left the bathroom.  Less than two minutes later, I went, oh, my God, I left my phone in the bathroom.  I walked back.  It was gone.  The phone was gone.  Just gone.  Tell your brother you left it out back last night, and when you woke up, it was gone.  The insurance company buys you a new phone.  Yeah.  What's the definition of crazy, by the way? 
[00:02:00]  Doing the same thing, expecting...  Insanity is doing the same things over and over again and expecting a different result.  And that's what I did.  We do every day here.  Yeah, I know.  We expect it to not suck, yet we wake up.  No, in some cases, insanity.  In our case, it's boring.  So I did exactly that on Friday.  I was walking around like a mental patient, checking the bathroom over and over and over again,  and even checking the same spots over and over again, hoping for a different result. 
[00:02:30]  The definition of insanity, right?  So we tore the bathroom apart.  Bruce, he's a great security guy over there.  So you, the security guy?  And one of his workers.  One of his workers.  So there were two security guards.  So there's two security guards in the bathroom, searching for this phone.  Yes.  Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer also.  A lackey.  This is like a reality show. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  It's turned into...  All looking for your phone.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And then I'm digging in the garbage.  Now, Ant really freaks out about germs, but in the end, I'm a human being, and that doesn't  excite me whatsoever.  But I'll dig in if I have to, to find a phone especially.  So I dug in.  It was disgusting.  It was like snot rags.  Of course.  It was just disgusting.  But I'm like, I'll just go in, and I'll just get it done, and I'm like...  And then I...  Was that the first place you checked? 
[00:03:30]  What?  The garbage?  No.  Of course.  No, of course.  Why would it be?  Why would I throw my phone in the garbage?  I'm just assuming, if you're digging through the garbage...  Oh, yeah.  It's a last resort.  You pretty much looked at all the other flat surfaces in the bathroom.  Yeah.  You don't want...  All right.  You're hoping for the best.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to go for the disgusting garbage right off the bat.  No.  So, after the show yesterday, coincidentally, after a massive rant and a lot of threatening...  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  I got a call from Steve, our Steve, saying, they found your phone.  Holy Jesus.  And, of course, Anthony...  And a scour a building of that size...  Yeah.  ...must have taken them...  You know, that kind of makes me feel a little better that they would do something like that  for someone involved in the show.  Not only did they find the phone, they found it literally a minute after we got off the air  yesterday.  So, they were waiting.  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.  And know what's weird, Ant?  It was right where I left it, according to SiriusXM. 
[00:04:30]  Wait, it was in the bathroom?  So, you're the idiot that didn't look good enough.  I got an email that says, they found the phone right where you left it.  See?  Now, look.  Obviously, you didn't look...  I didn't look good enough, right?  Yeah.  Or, do you have this...  Because I've been meaning to get this.  It's called a Predator app.  You put it on your phone, and it acts like Predator.  Yeah.  Where it just sinks into its surroundings.  I think I have that app. 
[00:05:00]  So, you can't see it.  Sure, yeah.  See that?  You probably had that on, and then it automatically shut off, and they were able to find it right  where you left it.  Yeah.  Now, let me get this right.  You, two security guys...  Brewer.  Jim Brewer.  Who is not trustworthy, let's be honest.  He's a little...  Well, he's a little...  He's a bit of shady.  Yeah, and he's a little out of it.  Yeah.  You know, we all do that.  Yeah, but we see it, Jim.  Two security guys right there.  Yeah.  In a...  Of course, this bathroom must have looked like the Taj Mahal.  Oh, yeah.  Was it a giant bathroom? 
[00:05:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  No.  So, it's like an oversized closet.  It has like three stalls, two urinals, and a sink.  I hope you were reprimanded for not looking good enough for your phone, because if it was  right where you left it, it's your fault, and you went off for no reason now yesterday.  I figured I took it a little too far yesterday, so I actually said to somebody on the phone,  I went, I'm sorry for... 
[00:06:00]  And I paused, and the guy jumped in and goes, for being an a-hole on the radio yesterday  or this morning, because it was yesterday.  Did he watch?  Yeah.  No, he didn't.  I swear to God.  Like, way to get the radio show.  Way to get it.  But see, in the end, Ann, it's my fault.  It was right there the whole time.  Of course, look, I'm not even disputing the fact that it's your fault.  Why don't you look there?  Jimmy, exactly.  Honestly, you know, I feel bad kind of sitting here taunting you that you didn't look good 
[00:06:30]  enough.  Stupid me.  We're all stupid.  All the people that were ripping the bathroom apart.  Blaming other people for taking your phone when it was right there where you left it.  The whole time.  The whole time.  All I had to do was click my heels.  And you called it.  Called it.  But didn't hear it ringing.  Why would I?  I'm stupid.  Holy Jesus, you're kidding me. 
[00:07:00]  No.  You are kidding me.  They did not tell you that it was right where you left it.  I'm extremely.  That is an effing insult.  I'm extremely happy I got my phone back.  Of course.  But, you know, who do you think you're dealing with?  You think I was born yesterday?  That old saying.  I wasn't born yesterday.  I always say I was born at night.  That is according to medical records.  Didn't try Becca.  The old I wasn't born yesterday. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  No S, Sherlock.  You would have ripped your mom's you-know-what if you were born yesterday.  Unbelievable that they came up with that story.  They couldn't have come up with a better story than it was right where you left it.  I got to communicate.  Like, hey, we found it.  Good news.  Your phone was found in the bathroom right where you left it.  They should have said, like, outside the bathroom or in a hallway.  Like, someone must have saw the heat was on and dropped it.  Look, you know, I would have, like, kicked it under something and made believe. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Oh, look what I found outside the bathroom.  Oh, wow.  Here it is.  This is weird to actually say that it was right where I left it is insulting.  Yeah.  Absolutely insulting.  Oh.  I guess this little radio show of ours has a little power, huh?  Just a tad.  Well, apparently not.  No.  Because you left it in the bathroom.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I left it in the bathroom.  That's right. 
[00:08:30]  What a set of balls.  But, dude, he's got to look where he left it.  I know.  I know.  Yeah.  Why don't you look there?  I thought it was gone, so I'm happy to have it back.  It's always the last place you look.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  They say.  You're right.  Let's say hi to Dan in Albany.  Dan?  Yo, Alfie.  What's going on, buddy?  Hey, Dan.  You know, in the words of the famous Ronnie Bates, if you found your own phone, let me 
[00:09:00]  do a hero.  You're a hero.  You're the hero of this story.  I didn't find the phone, so I can't be the hero.  No.  You left it where it was.  No.  Well, then whatever Chuggerhead did find it, that's the hero.  Yeah, they're officially the hero.  You're right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Speaking of phones, Jimmy did a great job on Hannity last night.  Oh, my God, yes.  Oh, thank you.  Yes, I was watching with great anticipation.  I haven't seen it.  I watched, and of course, I was joined by a bunch of people on Pal Talk, so we all watched 
[00:09:30]  together.  Oh, embarrassing.  And commented.  No, it was fun.  I was very shy.  Oh, it was so fun.  No, we were watching and just laughing and everything.  It was great.  Your first line got Mr. Hannity very nervous.  He's like, oh, obviously, he's a comedian.  Yeah, comedian.  You know, they'll do this and say crazy things.  He's actually great.  He came into the dressing room and we were talking.  First he asked, he's like, where's the boys?  He's like, why won't they come on?  He really like, he really wants to.  Come on a show in a second.  But he wants you guys to come on very much.  Oh, my God.  How about the invite, you dummy? 
[00:10:00]  No, he's been inviting you, but not through.  He actually has.  He goes, wow, you guys are hiding, huh?  I'm like, we're not stupid.  This was around the Imus thing.  I'd love to come on.  And he wanted us on a million times.  Like, hell no.  That ain't happening.  But yeah, he was there.  You know, and Greta stopped in.  She said, oh, I didn't talk to Greta very much.  No?  No, I wasn't going to say.  Chit chat.  But she, by the way, quickly, right after you, right after Hannity, Greta's show comes  on.  And she is a pit bull.  She went after that frigging, what's his name? 
[00:10:30]  Blagozovich.  Blagozovich.  Who can say his name?  He was getting into his car from a hotel, it looked like.  And from the hotel front door to the waiting car, she asked him about 50 questions.  He couldn't get away from her.  And he had people.  He had people.  She stood in the door of his car and would not let them shut the door.  You know what?  It's a really awkward thing because they can't just grab Greta Van Susteren by the hair and  throw her out of the way.  And she knows this.  She went in there and just asked him whatever the hell she wanted. 
[00:11:00]  And he wouldn't stop talking.  Like, no comment.  No, you don't hear that from him.  He's just like, what?  We were talking inside about how he's just one big distraction from the whole thing.  So, he says that he actually considered Oprah for the Senate seat.  Meanwhile, he never did, but he knows the press.  He knows the press is going to go, Oprah, Oprah, let's run with that story instead of  the fact that this guy was trying to sell a Senate seat.  And the press, the moronic press runs with the Oprah story. 
[00:11:30]  I was expecting him to go, and I saw the Loch Ness Monster.  The Loch Ness Monster.  Send someone to Loch Ness.  Send him there.  We'll get a backdrop of the Loch and talk about how he saw the Loch.  He's playing the press.  He knows how to get a little distraction.  Oh, the distractions he throws out there.  You were telling me that Greta grabbed his arm at one point.  At one point, Greta grabbed his arm.  And then one of the guy's security men stepped in front of a camera.  You see the cameraman's arm go, whoop, and push him out of the way. 
[00:12:00]  And then the camera gets down.  Greta knelt down by the doorway so they couldn't shut the car door.  They would have closed their head in.  They would have looked like a raging bull.  Salve Van Susser.  But getting back to Jimmy on Hannity, did you have a phone on you?  No, they were asking.  They came in.  It was Sean's Blackberry.  It was his?  It was Sean's.  Oh, see, my people were like, oh, my God, Jimmy and his stupid phone. 
[00:12:30]  No, if it rang, it wasn't mine.  Everyone had pegged you.  Yeah.  That it was your phone on, like, silent or something.  No, everybody.  And it was making that.  Well, we got it.  We got it.  You know when you have a phone too close to electronics?  They came over and said to Sean, is your phone on?  He goes, well, it's down here.  He's like, what's interfering with the guest mics?  It's a Blackberry, but it's not mine.  And I found it in a bathroom.  You can hear it?  My girl's like, is your Blackberry near the TV?  I'm like, how am I affecting the Hannity broadcast? 
[00:13:00]  I thought it was me, too.  Yeah.  I'm looking at my computer monitors.  You know, it's this sound.  Everyone knows that sound.  Oh, yeah.  Not too distracting.  Actually, we've done it to the people out there by accident.  But this is actually how it sounded on Hannity.  He's guilty.  Everybody knows.  He's unraveling.  He's going to be walking naked like Peter Fox.  That's a psychopath.  Right over Jimmy's line was, oh, no.  You heard the line loud and clear, though.  Let them eat static. 
[00:13:30]  That's funny.  And it happened another time, but let me see this real fast.  Come on.  Who cares what Rush Limbaugh says or any other political pundit?  They're just people.  I care what I say.  I care what you're going to say.  Because I'm here.  I'm saying that.  No, but Obama should.  This is an owl.  And I realized as I was saying that, that I was on Hannity's show.  Who cares what a political pundit says?  Yeah, I know.  It's like, well, you know, it's my job.  I didn't mean it like that, though.  Just go downstairs and just be like, hey, garbage man. 
[00:14:00]  Don't you hate people that pick up the garbage?  I didn't mean that.  I just figured that, you know, President Obama's probably watching.  And I wanted to throw out.  Oh, right.  That is true.  I didn't go with him because I'm sure you definitely want a picture with Obama.  Don't criticize these gates.  Like, you know, you're going up to easy targets, not real issues.  Obama has been calling out Hannity and Rush by name.  Yeah.  By name.  So apparently he is watching or at least getting reports.  So Jimmy Norton now on the president's radar? 
[00:14:30]  Perhaps.  I don't know.  And by the way, that's the last time you're going to hear me call him President Obama.  Jimmy Norton.  Just want to let you know.  You didn't hear this.  Can you?  Well, that's a good tease.  Because what we'll do is, after the break, Anthony's new name for President Obama.  Yep.  And I think we can play it over here.  There's an Obama rap song that someone did using Ant's rant that's really good.  Well, apparently.  I don't know rap songs, but it had me kind of like moving a little bit this morning. 
[00:15:00]  Maybe we can get Malik and the rest of our brothers to maybe comment about the song because it's damn good.  Well, I like the fact that we were listening to it to screen it.  Yeah.  And we were like, this is safe.  I heard there were curses in it.  This is safe.  We listened to it just for the explicit purpose.  Well, to see if it was good or not, but also to hear if there were curses in it.  And I yelled at Steve.  I'm like, Steve, this is perfect for this side.  There's no curses.  It's clean.  And the song, I go, cut, print it.  Here you go.  I threw it to him.  I'm like, we'll play the first break.  It's like, well, let's give it to Jiven, who does the dump button for us because he's got an ear for picking up on curses and stuff like that. 
[00:15:30]  Give it to Jiven.  And he comes back and he's like, yeah, there's three F's and two S's in it.  We missed three F's and two S's.  We missed them.  We hired them.  And only one.  Very good.  And only one of those would get us fired.  And we missed five of them.  All right.  People are starting to speculate what my new name for Obama is.  Of course. 
[00:16:00]  And this is just how I can't even say these.  Yeah, of course.  After the break, you'll you'll reveal that.  But I want to get an odd name.  It's not to the Z.  I mean, Jimmy had a great.  Someone from the medical profession.  Oh, my God.  That's going to be my new thing to get us out of trouble.  That's great.  What are you trying to say?  What?  What?  What?  Hold on. 
[00:16:30]  You got to turn off your phone before you continue.  That's fine.  I want to play another clip from Norton's appearance on Hannity instead of the phone interference.  Yeah, it's not fair.  The guy the guy killed for Hannity.  So we go to break with Jim commenting on Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  How do you say his name?  Governor of Illinois.  Does anyone have the real pronunciation?  Black.  Black.  Black.  Yes.  Stunt brain.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  Black. 
[00:17:00]  You know, just trying to say that name, more hair fell out of your head.  I think so.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Extra dose of the old Rogaine this morning.  The old Rogaine foam will take care of everything, right?  Yes.  All right.  Here's Jimmy on Hannity as we go to break.  Listen, the fact that they didn't let this play out, I think, helps them probably tremendously.  He put a Senate sale up for sale on eBay.  He's guilty.  Everybody knows.  He's unraveling.  He's going to be walking naked like Peter Fox.  That's a psychopath.  I like the fact that he's a governor. 
[00:17:30]  He's a megalomaniac with hair like a Lego person.  How do you not love watching this guy fall apart?  Well, obviously, he's a comedian, Jim, in case you don't know if you ever watched him  on HBO.  All right.  It's Opiate Anthony, starring Jim Norton, 877-212-O-N-A.  I have a big show announcer.  No.  I'm not making another.  Do you want to make it now?  No, I'm left.  It's your show.  No, I'm left.  A little after seven.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  A little after seven.  Big show announcement for Jimmy.  So you saw Slumdog?  He loves it, too.  Yeah.  I want to say Slimdog.  Slumdog Millionaire.  I saw it last night, too.  We all got our screener copies officially.  Ah, yeah.  It is Oscar season.  You know, you get the screeners this time of year.  Yep.  We've got to be up on all these movies.  And you should have popped it in last night, man.  Ah.  You should have popped it in.  Yeah, I should have popped it in all right. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  How good was that movie?  I really liked it, man.  I loved it.  I really liked it a lot.  I thought it was great.  It was really well acted.  I didn't see any of it coming.  It was not predictable.  It was just different.  Yeah, they messed up marketing this movie.  Anthony said it perfect in the office.  When you read the synopsis for Slumdog Millionaire, you go to yourself, why would I see this?  Let me tell you something.  Some kid in India is on, you know, who wants to be a millionaire?  Who cares?  When I was in Atlantic City, I was scrolling through the movies on demand over there at 
[00:19:00]  the lovely Borgata.  And that movie, I was like, oh, everybody's talking about this.  Let me rent this one.  Yeah.  And then I look at the synopsis and go, ew.  This just sounds like a...  Why would I want to see this?  Yeah.  So they missed out on getting my moolah.  Well, we got an artsy theater in our neighborhood, and we go there from time to time. 
[00:19:30]  Sometimes we'll just go, ah, let's try this movie.  And I saw that Slumdog over and over again when I went there to see The Wrestler and a  few other movies.  And I'm like, well, I don't want to see this.  But then the buzz, you start hearing the chatter out there.  The chatter, a little chatter.  You know, the people in your world are talking about the movie, and the movie reviewers,  and this and that.  And also, I'm like, all right, I got it.  All right, I'll see it.  Yeah.  And I'm so happy I finally checked it out.  It was great.  It really was great.  I feel like I should have watched it.  It's a great name for a movie, too. 
[00:20:00]  It's like Slumdog Millionaire.  It just sounds like a really cool movie.  You think people really live like that in India?  Of course they do.  They absolutely do.  That depressed the hell out of me, man.  They show the Indian slums, but they're just living in garbage.  I mean, it's literally, they live in a dump.  Yeah.  And I'm saying to my chick, like, why don't they just clean the garbage up?  Because that's where the good people were dumping their garbage, though.  You know, they were basically living in a, yeah.  And they're called.  A dump.  A dump.  Thank you.  And they're called Slumdogs. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  And it's chilling how filthy they live.  And they do live that dirty.  And the kids beg, and it's just horrendous.  A horrendous life.  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  I don't disagree.  You know, they made their bed.  They have to lie in it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was.  A little garbage pickers.  It was so good, though.  I was sitting in my amazing apartment with my amazing wife, and I was like, God, do you  think people really live like this? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, horrid.  Oh, well.  Anyway, you want some ice cream?  High above the streets of Manhattan.  Yes.  No, I was depressed by the depiction of how these people live over here.  Terrible.  It was terrible, man.  But the movie was amazing.  Man, stop having kids.  You overpopulated, crappy country.  Well, it's a caste system.  What?  It's a caste system.  What?  It's a caste system.  Yes, that is.  They're all actors.  Oh.  No one made it okay for me.  At the end, they did a Bollywood moment. 
[00:21:30]  That was so cool, actually.  I loved it.  And they were all dancing and stuff.  A little dance like Bollywood.  And I'm like, oh, okay.  They're all actors.  Because sometimes after these movies, you're like, oh, you almost forget you just saw a  movie, and you think it's all real.  And then a bunch of colorful dancers.  Oh, yeah.  They're all, like, dancing and happy, and the bad guys are dancing with the good guys.  Oh, it's like the end of a Broadway show.  It was just a fun little movie.  Oh, Christ.  But I did like that.  It didn't make me sick to my stomach.  It was different.  Yeah.  And the music was pretty catchy in Slumdog. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, but with a little rap beat to it.  Oh, yeah?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  But what was the name of the song?  I can't.  Dude, I was on my head.  What, the M.I.A. song that we played a little while?  No, no, no.  The very last song that they played.  During the credits?  Yeah.  And the dancing, the Bollywood thing?  Yeah.  God.  I don't know.  Do we have that, Danny?  We'll find it.  I got some stuff.  Oh, what do you got?  Let me hear a little.  Wow.  It was almost right on the nosy with that one. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, I've got to get this for my iPod.  The good, the bad, and the Slumdog.  Oh, this is the last song.  This is what they dance to?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Would not be out of my head.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  What is this?  P. Dottie?  Oh, the confidence of Kong in that one. 
[00:23:00]  This is amazing music from around the world that we just are never exposed to here in America.  There's a channel on the satellite that does, like, world music, and you're like, wow, man,  they're doing some really cool stuff around the world musically, but they'll never play  it on radio here.  No.  You know, regular terrestrial radio.  Very busy playing other garbage.  Yeah.  I jumped on my Twitter right after the movie, Opie Radio, and I said, game over.  This thing wins everything. 
[00:23:30]  It was better than Frost next year.  Game over.  This movie, trust me, will win every Oscar possible.  I want to see Mulk.  Mulk.  Mulk.  I haven't seen Mulk.  I can't say it because it makes me flubby.  Mulk.  Yeah, but Sean Pellett's supposed to be great in Mulk.  I saw Mulk.  It was good.  It was really good, actually.  People accepting for their SAG Award, I gather.  The SAG Award.  The other night.  Sunday?  Yeah.  And I heard a bunch of the actors coming up, and they were having fun. 
[00:24:00]  Even Meryl Streep.  You know, great actress, Meryl Streep.  She came up and had some fun with her speech.  A couple other people came up and had fun.  And then Sean Penn's got to get up there and just talk like, I think this really opens  the eyes to people, that diversity and things.  It's like, can this guy ever have fun?  Can he ever have a good time in public?  He better be one funny son of a bitch at home because he is nothing but a depressing, 
[00:24:30]  serious douche.  He's a downer.  Whenever he shows up, a downer.  He's a downer.  He's a guy desperately trying to find meaning in the fact that he pretends to be other people  for a living.  Yeah.  He's desperately trying to have a social impact or a meaning.  All you do is pretend.  Sean, Sean, Sean, you made it past the Spicoli character.  It's okay now. 
[00:25:00]  You're not typecast as that guy.  So you can lighten up a little bit.  Can we get that clip?  Is it worth playing on the air?  Yeah.  In perspective with some of the other people that accepted and got up there and had fun  with it.  Yeah.  It's just him being a serious douche.  Yeah.  That he always is.  Danny found something that's pretty cool on IMDB.  They have the top 250 movies of all time, right?  Movies of all time.  Slumdog Millionaire is currently 34th, which is amazing. 
[00:25:30]  Beating out so far, Apocalypse Now, WALL-E, American History X, Forrest Gump, A Clockwork  Orange, Alien, The Shining, Raging Bull, et cetera.  Slow down.  Just silly.  Well, you haven't seen the movie yet, so.  Raging Bull's an amazing movie.  It's new and probably getting a lot of votes right now.  It shouldn't beat Clockwork.  It shouldn't beat Apocalypse.  It shouldn't beat Alien, for the love of God.  Yeah.  Alien.  I love Alien.  Alien.  It stinks.  It still holds up.  It's great.  What's number one?  It's every night. 
[00:26:00]  What's the top ten on there?  If you tell me it's Citizen Kane, I'll kick the screen in.  No.  Number one is typically always Shawshank Redemption.  And it is.  Why?  It's just the best movie ever made.  Wow.  Really?  It's the worst movie at best.  Wow.  Shawshank.  I disagree heavily.  Shawshank, Godfather, Godfather 2.  Danny, wait.  Haven't you learned anything from us?  Why would you just pop the number one movie?  Oh, yeah.  I'm a douche, aren't I?  We could tease this for three days.  Three days.  I had to defend my favorite, though.  Who votes for this?  What dummies?  Well, go with the top ten. 
[00:26:30]  Ten is 12 Angry Men.  I saw that in film class.  That's old.  Which one?  Doring.  1957.  It was great.  Star Wars Episode 5.  Empire Strikes Back.  Nine.  One Flew.  Over.  The Cuckoo's Nest.  Not quite Shawshank.  Shawshank was a great movie.  It was an average movie at best.  Turn me around, because that is probably one of my top three movies of all time.  And turn me around like you turned Patrice. 
[00:27:00]  It's not that I can say the movie sucked, but when you compare it with a work of art,  like Raging Bull or Clockwork or Cuckoo's Nest, it's a good movie, but nothing like those.  Nothing as good as those.  Because Tim Robbins is boring.  I just didn't care as much about it.  It reminded me of Escape from Alcatraz in a weird way.  Sex was in it?  It's fabulous.  I didn't say that I didn't scrap and rewind.  I think I dare tell you, Jimmy, you have to watch it again. 
[00:27:30]  Many people, they disagree.  That's fine.  Stupid Morgan Freeman narrating the whole thing.  He's playing his Morgan Freeman character.  Hold on, hold on.  But it's not fair enough.  Yeah, it's not fair enough.  Morgan Freeman, when he did that, it was original.  But the problem is, he's done the same exact thing for the next 20 movies he was in.  I mean, that's kind of where it started with the whole Morgan narration bit.  And unfortunately, he's just been kind of typecast in that kind of a narration role. 
[00:28:00]  And a Dufresne.  For the next 25 years.  Boo.  Boo.  You will not ruin this movie for me.  It's one of my favorites.  It doesn't suck at all, do you?  I'm not saying it's not a good movie.  I say average at best when you're looking at it compared to Cuckoo's Nest and The Godfather.  What, are they nuts?  Well, let's go with the top ten.  So then you've got Schindler's List in seven.  Pulp Fiction, six.  Here's where I got a major.  It's not belong in the top ten either. 
[00:28:30]  Well, this is an overrated movie.  Wow, why was that overrated?  Again, better than Cuckoo's Nest?  Pulp Fiction was amazing.  Raging Bull is not in the top 250?  Pulp Fiction was amazing.  Let's go into a holding pattern here for a second.  Yeah, let's calm down a little bit.  Pulp Fiction was an amazing movie.  Pulp Fiction was a great, perfect time that it came out.  It was done amazingly the way it didn't get tied up until the end.  You really didn't know what was going on.  Yeah.  I thought the acting was really good.  I agree.  The storyline was fantastic. 
[00:29:00]  I loved it.  Yeah, but loved it.  And it was filmed very well.  Great.  Quentin hasn't had something like that in quite a while.  I got to say, I think Jimmy might have a point as far as this list goes, because number  five, The Dark Knight.  What?  Yeah.  These are people that are voting on new movies.  Like, those movies will fall to the wayside in years.  The Dark Knight is the fifth greatest movie of all time.  Well, here's the thing, though.  I saw that recently again, and Jimmy ruined that movie for me. 
[00:29:30]  I'm like, you know, you take Heath Ledger on that movie, that's stunk.  It's horrible.  You know what I saw recently, and I know I'm going to get killed on this, but it was a  good movie, and I don't want to hear it.  Pink Panther 2.  The new one?  Yeah.  I was laughing my ass off at the...  Okay, I can't even hold it any longer.  Jimmy was picking up a sharp object to stab me.  I stopped breathing, because I thought Jimmy was going to take a shot at you, for real. 
[00:30:00]  I literally stopped breathing.  Jimmy was going to punch me.  I would have looked at him less incredulously if he said, my girlfriend's pregnant, and  I'm happy about it.  Wow.  You had a look on your face.  We were about to say, it finally happened, Jimmy.  I was actually...  He lost his mind.  I was trying to judge the heat in my coffee, and could I get the lid off discreetly and  throw it at you?  Oh, God.  What movie?  Are you just kidding? 
[00:30:30]  I'm kidding, of course.  I just wanted to see your reaction, and I got exactly what I wanted.  Number four.  Which looked great.  Number four.  I want you to do that when you're acting.  No one's ever given me motivation like that before.  You just need Anthony to go on your casting calls with you.  Number four movie of all time, according to IMDb.  Buono il Bruto il Cativo 2.  I think I said that right.  I don't even know. 
[00:31:00]  What the hell is that?  I did six years of Spanish, and I can't even pronounce this movie.  1966.  Is it French?  Some foreign film.  Is it French?  Who knows?  Oh, it's Italian.  That's why.  All right.  What did Jimmy say?  I thought he said it.  Oh.  It took four years of Spanish, but it's French.  Yeah.  It's actually Italian.  It's Italian.  That's how lame I am.  Third, Godfather 2.  Two is Godfather, and then Shawshank Redemption.  Number one movie.  That's why these lists suck.  Face.  When you see the current movies in there, you're like, all right, this list is a waste of time. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, but these lists, though, it's compiled by users of the IMDb, and they only count votes  from regular voters and users.  So what is the IMDb kind of like filtered list?  And it'll change.  And have better criteria.  Over time, the newer movies that are popular now are going to drop out.  But the classics will always be it.  Right, when Dark Knight first came out, it shot up to number one, and there was a lot  of argument about it, because obviously it doesn't belong there or anywhere close to  it.  So it's slowly moving its way down the list. 
[00:32:00]  Neither does 12 Angry Men.  Sidney Lumet directed it.  It was a good movie, but it's not in the top 20 movies ever made.  Boring.  A little boring.  No, I liked it.  I mean, it was well acted.  They were angry.  And there's 12 of them.  Let's say hi to them.  Let's say hi to David in Kansas City.  David.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, David.  Hey, Jimmy, I just want to ask you something.  If it's not Ozzy or Black Sabbath or Clockwork Orange or Godfather, everything else in the  entire world stinks.  Not at all stupid.  I said I love Raging Bull. 
[00:32:30]  I said I love Slumdog Millionaire.  I just don't like to take something new and overrate it.  How could you not like Taken?  Don't be an idiot, sir.  Taken was terrible.  It was a terrible movie.  Everything's terrible, Jimmy.  Dude, I've probably seen more films than you have, and I probably like more movies than  you do.  Taken was a bad movie.  I'm sorry.  I don't go for the big action one.  Oh, God, he's got to get his daughter back.  It sucked.  I like it.  It was a weak story.  It was corny and predictable. 
[00:33:00]  It did nothing for me.  The action was amazing, though.  You know what?  It was great and pretty, too.  It was amazing.  The storyline was a little weak.  It was very weak.  And his hair was a little weak.  It was very unrealistic.  The daughter was a terrible actress.  You thought she was a good actress, dude?  Who, the girl?  No, the girl was terrible, but the action was good.  Who cares?  The action was good.  The daughter stunk.  The one he chased, he ran like a retard.  It was corny.  Oh, the rich father buys her a horse. 
[00:33:30]  How did you not want to see that horse's head come off and get thrown into Walter's bed?  You boob.  All right.  Get out of here.  David from Kansas City.  I feel like an idiot.  You know that movie I said, Buono, El Bruto.  Oh, no.  Wait till you hear this.  It's coming in from all directions.  Rich, Philly.  Yo, if you would have one of your guys click on that movie, it would have turned out that  that movie was The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, some piece of crap.  I'm like, some dumb movie, Buono, El Bruto, El Cativo.  I wouldn't have known that either, though.  No.  No, of course not.  Thank you, sir.  What number's Clockwork?  Everyone else can hang up.  They're calling a lot on that one.  Huh?  I'll ask you what number Clockwork and Raging Bull are.  What's right there?  I can't see.  I'm asking what.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's not right there.  Yeah, it's further down on the left.  Raging Bull should definitely be way out there.  Raging Bull was amazing.  I just recently watched it, and wow.  Clockwork.  You just forget how great of a movie that is.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  Clockwork comes in at number 52. 
[00:34:30]  Okay.  And Raging Bull, 74.  74.  74.  Behind 12 Angry Men.  Well, behind L.A. Confidential, my friend.  What?  Oh, as it should.  That was a really good one.  And behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Oh, of course.  And Chinatown.  Again, good movie.  I mean, you'd have to love the director's lifestyle.  But it was, you know, that was also a little slow. 
[00:35:00]  You know, she wants the charges dropped.  Really?  The girl that Roman Polanski had a little sex with.  Once the charges dropped, she doesn't want to file a complaint.  She's done with it because she's just sick of it.  She's sick of the whole frigging, you know, years and years of this.  So she'd rather just forget about the whole thing.  He'd come back, do whatever he wants.  But isn't it amazing how willing people are to work?  And, look, I love Woody.  I love Woody Allen.  But they're willing to work with Woody.  They're willing to work with Roman Polanski.  And yet, Michael Richards is ruined because he dropped an N-bomb. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Or these other guys that have said racially insensitive things were ruined.  And this is a guy who drugged and had sex with a 13-year-old.  And then, look, you know, Woody had nude pictures of his stepdaughter.  He might not marry him.  But they can't line up fast enough to work with people.  I kind of respect all of them.  Hey.  It runs the gamut as far as Anthony's concerned.  Isn't it amazing, though?  Yeah, it really is.  Yeah.  People are really attacking you because you don't like Shawshank.  I didn't say I didn't like Shawshank. 
[00:36:00]  Yes, you did.  You said you hated it.  It was an awful movie.  No, I said it was an average movie.  I liked it.  I thought it was enjoyable, and I'd watch it if it was on.  It's not.  Mike and Jersey, Step Brothers is the funniest movie ever.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Number one movie is Gap by Paul O.  I think we might have him on the show today.  Oh, what a treat.  Now we're talking about a fine director.  All right, let's go home.  Ray.  Yo.  What's up?  Oh, you doesn't have to call me Ray. 
[00:36:30]  You can call me Jay.  You can call me Johnny.  You can call me Ray J.  Die.  You can call me Tool.  You can call me Douche.  You can call me Bag.  But you doesn't have to call me Johnson.  You guys are out of your mind.  Hey, listen, Jimmy.  What are you talking about with Shawshank Redemption, man?  You honestly did not like that movie.  But I never said that.  Sorry, I liked it.  No, you really did say that.  I thought it was an average movie.  It was enjoyable. 
[00:37:00]  But I think it's very overrated.  I did like it.  I didn't say I didn't like it.  If I didn't like it, I'd tell you I didn't like it.  The original story is a Stephen King short story.  Paul Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.  I did like it.  Did not love it.  I agree with you guys with the whole fact that this list is a little off-keel here.  Yeah.  I want a legitimate list.  That would be fun to kind of take a look at.  Not these lists where they have to throw the new movies in or the new songs or the new albums.  Yeah, because they're new.  They do it with every list that we go on. 
[00:37:30]  They're popular now.  How would you do the list, though?  You know, like who would vote on it?  You know what?  That's a very good question.  But you could do a better job than this.  Maybe our listeners come up with, like, the top 25 movies of all time.  Let's see if in 20 years, you know, The Dark Knight is still up on that list.  It's not even one of the best five movies of the year.  No.  No, not at all.  I thought it was great.  No.  The legend was.  I mean, he was phenomenal.  He's the only reason I kept watching the movies.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah, Jimmy's right. 
[00:38:00]  Iron Man this past year was better.  Milk was way better.  Slumdog Millionaire was way better.  The Wrestler was way better.  And I would throw, like, Tropic Thunder in there as a better movie than this.  Tropic Thunder, I thought Robert Downey Jr., I thought he was phenomenal.  And everyone's talking about Jack Black.  I'm like, you guys are out of your mind.  No, we're talking about how Jack Black, I didn't like Jack Black in that movie.  I didn't see Mulk.  Did you say Mulk?  Mulk.  All right, guys, I don't want to hold you up.  I'm punching up. 
[00:38:30]  All right, good job, Ray.  Someone wants to know where.  You don't have to call him Ray.  All right.  I hate that bitch.  People are talking about Scarface.  Well, Scarface, that movie just doesn't hold up.  No, it doesn't hold up.  I'm sorry for the people out there that live and die by that movie, but.  What movie?  Scarface.  The blood is.  It doesn't hold up.  It looks like, yeah.  The story's great.  Alcino's great in the movie.  Yeah.  The blood looks fake.  They had to remaster the sound of the gunshots to make it even tolerable.  Right.  If you watch the original version before they remastered the audio, every gunshot sounds the 
[00:39:00]  same, and it's an old-style gunshot sound.  Oh, really?  They finally added some bass to it, made some of the machine gun sounds different than the  pistols, so it sounds better, and it puts you a little in the mood.  That was one of my biggest complaints about Scarface was the sound was horrid.  Yeah.  But there's no way to fix, I guess not no way, but if they want to get in there and fix  the way the blood looked.  The blood was awful.  Like tempera paint.  It was horrible.  People are taking, like, hundreds of rounds and there's no holes in them or anything. 
[00:39:30]  It's just like, come on.  Yeah.  They need to take their sunglasses and members-only jacket off the assassin.  Yeah, they do.  Update that.  It was so long.  Walking slowly with the shades.  All right, we know it was 83, but he was cool.  Come on.  There's no reason for that.  Yeah.  And the phone starts to hang up angrily in his robe.  You're not dying, sonny.  You're killing everyone around you.  He's dressed like Leon Schermer.  Tony, I told you, Tony.  I told you a long time ago. 
[00:40:00]  We got organized.  We got organized.  All he does is hang up the phone.  Hang up the phone.  Yeah.  That's his idea of getting organized as a yard full of assassins are coming to murder his  awful non-Spanish sister.  The old dandelion head.  And he's worried about the...  He's right.  Don't touch me, Tony.  Do you want me, Tony?  You want to f*** me, Tony?  The mother was good, too.  You know, you give to me two days ago.  Go fight. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Putting the words all backwards.  Yeah, that one just doesn't hold up.  I like the, uh, the, uh, what was the, uh, the musical montage, they call it?  Oh, yeah, with the...  Oh, take it to the limit.  Take it to the limit.  It's an 80s montage.  A montage.  A montage.  A montage.  A montage.  That was the unbelievable 80s montage that worked its way into every movie.  Look, he's getting successful over time.  Yeah.  At the time, it worked, but when you look back now, it's, it's...  He gives you the chills of the douche variety. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  She's opening her own, like, uh, he's opening her, like, salon.  A salon.  Take it to the limit.  And, uh, the tiger across the thing.  And he's walking, like, oh, that stupid walk.  Before I got my lips.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, here it is.  Look.  Ooh, taking it to the limit by cutting a ribbon.  Yeah.  In front of the salon.  Dan, dan, dan.  Money counters.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Frrrr.  Did they show them carrying big things of, uh, cash in the bank? 
[00:41:30]  Yes, yeah.  Yeah, the big, uh, things.  And the bankers looking like, uh-oh, how are we going to launder this much money?  Yeah.  There's a clock with no 12.  That's why I couldn't fall over when they were shooting me.  Because my lips were holding me up.  There you go.  She had a lot of shots to my wig.  It's not fatal, you know.  They gave my wig to my sister.  That's why she looks so good.  Gina wore my wig.  My curly one.  Little shoes. 
[00:42:00]  They tried to hang me like they hung Omar out the helicopter.  But my lips kept me from hitting the ground and dying.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I got to get organized.  Let me straighten out my wig.  Straighten out my wig and hang up the phone.  Oh, I hung up my wig and straightened out my phone.  Oh, that's funny.  God damn.  Push it!  Without my wig, I look like Joe Pantaleon.  Oh, God. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right, we got to take a break.  It rocks.  Oh, we haven't even told everybody.  Louis C.K. is coming in today in about a half hour, 40 minutes.  Yes.  That's a big whoop.  Louis.  Good.  I wonder what other technology he's going to find me that I have to run out and get  that damn.  Every time, right?  Every time he comes in, he's got some cool camera or a gadget.  He was the flip camera guy, right?  Yep.  Flip cam guy.  He came in.  He goes, look at this.  Now we all have him.  Must buy.  Let's hope he comes in with something called the red hair changer.  Oh, God. 
[00:43:00]  I'm going to throw hot coffee on Louis as soon as he walks in.  All right.  After the break, Ant's new name for Obama.  Ah, right.  And the Obama rap song that was made using one of Anthony's rants.  Oh, no.  We're going to play that next, hopefully.  Huh?  Hope so.  They got the beefs in place.  Yeah, what's going on with that song?  You should have had it, Mike.  Listen very carefully.  What happened?  E-Rock's beeping it.  E-Rock's beeping it.  Oh, great.  We'll have it Thursday.  And there'll still be two Fs in it.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, Pete, Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  Good morning.  What was this?  A little dance music.  I almost forgot it's two for Tuesday.  Thank God.  Thank God it's two for Tuesday.  How about that?  Oh, God.  What is this?  I feel like I'm driving in my Firebird on Babylon Speedway. 
[00:44:00]  877-212-018.  Oh, I got arrested for that Ponzi scheme.  It's hitting everybody.  Hey, Andy Pettit.  Oh, my God.  Where's my last track?  Wow.  What a faux pas this is.  Yeah, no kidding.  Andy Pettit signed a one-year deal with the Yankees.  Yep.  We don't do a lot of sports. 
[00:44:30]  We try to give you a few of the headlines here.  We don't go deep.  We let the sports talk shows do that.  Who can listen to half that crap?  Discussing stats before straight hours.  Just give me the headlines and move on.  Well, this is a headline, all right.  Andy Pettit signs a one-year deal with the Yankees.  Ready for this, Jimmy?  I don't know if you've heard of this one yet.  I've not heard it at all.  He signed for $5.5 million for one year.  Nice, right?  Sounds good.  Nice.  Sounds good.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  Well, it's $4.5 million less than what he was offered two months ago. 
[00:45:00]  Two months ago, they offered him about $10 million.  For a year, and he turned it down?  Someone did.  What a jerk.  He was waiting for a better offer, and something is going on with Major League Baseball, like  the economy.  Yeah, the economy, I guess.  It's hitting baseball, too, because a mere two months later, they're like, well, look,  that is now off the table, and if you want to play with us next year, it's now for $5.5 million, 
[00:45:30]  which obviously is a great living, no matter how you look at it.  But still, he just lost $4.5 million by waiting two months.  What agent, fired agent?  I was saying inside, he should be able to just throw fastballs at his agent's face, just  as hard and fast as he can whip a ball right into his face until it's caved in.  What agent do you have that screws up that badly? 
[00:46:00]  Super Agent Bob Eatman, obviously.  No.  His agent is Ted Burroughs.  Ted.  Agent's emporium?  Yeah, I think that $10 million is not enough, Andrew.  I could get you $72 million.  Just sit tight, bub.  Bum.  Bad news, Andrew.  Bad news.  The offer for $10 million is off the table.  There's been a miscommunication.  $32,000, will you take it?  $32,000, will you take it? 
[00:46:30]  Puss on travel expenses.  Wow.  And, well, we got three major free agents that still haven't been picked up by anybody, right?  Manny Ramirez.  Yeah, Manny.  Ben Sheets, pitcher.  And, uh...  Ben what?  Ben Sheets.  I'm not the poor guy.  We all do.  But, uh, Pettit.  Pettit's actually taking a $10 million cut this year because he was making $16 million last  year.  Wow.  Good.  Good. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, well.  It sucks.  Sucks to be you.  And while we're talking about sports, Super Bowl's this Sunday, right?  Mm-hmm.  I think this is the first year we are barely talking about the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  And when I say we, I think collectively.  Collectively.  No one really cares.  I'm sorry.  Why don't we care about the Super Bowl as much this year?  Well, the commercial, they say it's like the Super Bowl for advertising, too.  So I need to get a kick out of them.  Is it because it's the Steelers and the Cardinals, you think?  I think so, yeah. 
[00:47:30]  It's like, I don't really, nobody expected the Cardinals to do anything, so.  They're saying it's an easy ticket.  You could get a ticket to the Super Bowl this year.  Really?  Yeah, it's a lot cheaper than it used to be.  Just because of the economy.  Will they change the teams after you buy a ticket?  No, I don't think so.  They don't do that.  Well, then.  No.  Why get a ticket?  Teams are already set.  I can't get, uh, I can't get up for this game, man.  I don't know.  I'll be watching like anyone else, but.  I bet you the ratings will be down, though.  You're going to go see Metallica instead?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the hay. 
[00:48:00]  What the hay is right.  I got something that, well, I'll tease this.  Let me go to Anthony.  Because Anthony's got a new name for Obama.  Well, I was just looking at our brand new New York senator and how the governor appointed her.  Yeah.  And it was his second choice.  The first was a toaster.  He's standing so proudly next to her.  Doesn't even know what he's standing next to.  No, he does not.  I love him.  A coat rack.  His new senator.  Funny. 
[00:48:30]  He gestured to an open field.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to a door.  Your new senator.  Governor.  Governor.  You're talking to a pencil.  This way.  Governor.  Still home.  Ah.  This is from a movie.  Jimmy, this is for you.  I want you to try to figure out what this is.  I didn't think Jimmy was a big fan of this type of music. 
[00:49:00]  There's a reason I picked Jimmy, though.  Usually I go with Anthony.  I go, Anthony, figure this out.  You've got to figure out what this is.  Daddy played the banjo beneath the yellow tree.  It rang across the backyard, an old-time melody.  The melody.  I loved to hear the music.  I was only five.  Uh-oh.  I listened as his fingers made the banjo come on.  Oh, the banjo. 
[00:49:30]  Do you know what that is, Jimmy?  I do, yes.  All right.  What is it?  It's a man singing about his youth and how somebody made the banjo really resonate to him.  I'm going to reveal that in a few minutes, and it might get Jimmy going just a little bit today.  That's all I'm going to say, yes.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Hey, Ope, are you looking forward to E-Rock's great Hot Wings this Super Bowl Sunday?  Why?  Hold on.  Why?  Can I hear that again, please?  No, not yet, Jimmy.  No, no, no, not yet. 
[00:50:00]  I think you might be on to what I'm getting at here, though.  Really?  Yep.  You're going to have to wait.  You're going to have to wait to come.  Yep.  Steven S. reminds me of the E-Rock Hot Wings story that my lovely wife told the other day to some new people.  Really?  Yeah, I had a Super Bowl party, and E-Rock came over.  I think Danny was there.  Sure.  Danny, you were there, right?  Absolutely.  And E-Rock, kind of trying to be a brown nose, shows up with his plate of wings. 
[00:50:30]  I remember there being also no seats there.  Well, that's my old place.  I remember it was described to me.  I wasn't there.  Yeah.  But I did hear eyewitness accounts.  Yeah.  As one of the worst Super Bowl parties ever.  Yeah, probably.  We even watched the Super Bowl.  Jimmy fell asleep.  That's how exciting my Super Bowl party.  I remember Jimmy fell asleep, right, Jimmy?  There were no Snick Snacks.  No.  I was standing like a horse, and it goes off.  You guys had to, like, dodge mice all day long.  Yeah, this is a mouse-infested apartment with no furniture.  Yeah.  And E-Rock brought wings for everybody. 
[00:51:00]  And my girl, because she's a lovely person, unlike myself, who cares about people, she  noticed that no one was eating the E-Rock wings.  Uh-huh.  So, uh, one of the guys distracted E-Rock while I dumped a lot of the hot wings into the garbage  pail.  Now, you might say to yourself, why would you do that?  That is so cruel.  But I was actually doing it so it looked like people were enjoying his wings. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  But then I had to call him out on it on Monday when I said to E-Rock, wow, the wings were  ahead.  And he's like, yeah, I know, man.  Yeah, they were all gone.  They were all gone.  And then I had to tell him live on the radio that we, uh, dumped the wings to make them  feel good.  He wasn't onto it when mice were running around looking for water.  Nothing.  That was, uh...  Well, there you go.  But anyway, thank you for reminding me of that.  I'm Stephen S. 
[00:52:00]  God, do I love it.  Well, just of all the ways...  I didn't want to look at Jimmy, and then I look at him and just say, yeah.  It wasn't awful, but it was funny.  He was like, of all the ways that you could have pointed out that he didn't pick up on  it, that the mice were asking for water.  Why?  I could have them with little, like, hot sauce around their little whiskers or...  Yeah.  How about, uh, you know, he didn't realize when mice were running around with things  with blue cheese.  Right.  See?  That's good.  Gee.  You know, but, you know, you got a little too, uh, a little too weird with it. 
[00:52:30]  He didn't realize when all of a sudden the mouse had on a Pluck You Chicken shirt.  What?  I just...  You know, things like that, moments like that slow you down a bit.  It's like you got to take that and kind of pull back on the reins a little.  I was feeling a little too cocky this morning.  Anthony was putting his lid on his tea through the entire joke, and he didn't miss a beat.  Yeah, let me tell you how those mice come out looking for a drink.  Oof.  He cleared his throat.  Yeah, I need this tea now. 
[00:53:00]  Uh, what's your name for Obama?  My whole body's hot.  What's your name for Obama?  Everyone wants to know.  No, all right.  All right.  Besides that.  Joke.  I, uh, want to call Obama.  Your logic is a little twisted, by the way.  It's a little twisted.  Well, a lot of people were calling, uh, George Bush, especially his detractors, people that  just wanted to make fun of him, I think.  Yeah.  Uh, W.  Uh-huh.  George W.  Because, you know, he's got that southern drawl, so they'd add his middle initial in there. 
[00:53:30]  Without saying his last name.  No.  It wasn't George W. Bush.  It was just, hey, W. Hey, George W.  Uh-huh.  Uh, I am, from now on, referring to, uh, President Obama.  Oh, no.  As Barack Hussein.  Barack Hussein.  Obama.  No.  No Obama.  But using the Bush logic, why don't you just say Obama H?  I mean, Barack H.  Because it's not like, um, trying to distinguish him from another, uh, uh, Obama or Barack. 
[00:54:00]  Um, it's just one of those things where it's like, it, it suits me.  It fits.  And it's his middle name.  And, uh, what put it over the top was the fact that he did give, um, his first televised  presidential interview to a Middle Eastern television station.  Well, he wants the world to like us.  You know something?  Screw that.  He went over to some goddamn, uh, Arab, uh, station as his first official, as the president, 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Uh, uh, uh, interview was given to some Arab, uh, uh, Middle Eastern television station.  Um, so to me, he's earning his middle name, which is very common in the Middle East, Hussein.  So I will call him Barack Hussein.  Your new friends enjoyed that one?  That is, I don't have new friends.  Did your new friends enjoy that one? 
[00:55:00]  I don't have new friends.  I don't have any friends that I haven't had.  How many people went, ah, that's brilliant.  He is now officially Barack Hussein.  Obama.  No, just Barack Hussein.  Oh.  Now back to, uh, banjo music.  Not yet, Jimmy.  Not yet.  What?  I wanted to hear for a second.  Not yet.  I was quite enjoying that.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Are you on to it, though? 
[00:55:30]  I don't know.  I think I might know.  Because I'm very worldly.  Yes.  Yeah.  I have to play the rap song first, because we're talking about Barack.  Sure.  Uh, this guy, Nate S.  Yes.  A.K.A.  Farrow in Buffalo.  Farrow?  Wow.  Took Anthony's rant about Obama.  One of my...  Probably took a bunch of rants.  One of my many, or a few of my many.  And, uh, made a rap song, which is... 
[00:56:00]  I gotta tell you, it's catchy.  There's a bunch of beeps in it, unfortunately, because we're on the wrong side right now.  For this, anyway.  Yeah, you know.  So bear with the beeps.  Yeah.  It's a much better song without the beeps.  Maybe...  Are we allowed to do the uncensored version on our website, or is this...  No, I can't have the language, right?  Oh, my God.  The internet.  It's good to keep it clean.  Way to go.  We'll put it up somewhere.  We'll pop it on somewhere.  Yeah.  Way to go.  I'm drinking more water than a thirsty mouse.  God, I hate when you get a laugh with it. 
[00:56:30]  All right, here's...  Barack's Gonna Take Ant's Money, it's called.  Barack's Gonna Take Ant's Money.  By Nate S., a.k.a. Farrow in Buffalo.  Check this out.  Hopefully it plays well with the beeps.  And about me sounding like a white supremacist over the past week or so,  since Obama was elected.  I'm seeing things that are happening outside.  I'm experiencing things myself.  This isn't my imagination. 
[00:57:00]  I am being bullied.  That is just what's happening.  Come on.  I've been listening on the radio to what's going down on the O&H show.  Obama's got Anthony's tickets and a twist.  Yeah.  Something about the tax.  And the guns in his fist.  Wow.  I'm guessing in fact they're going to take Ant's guns away.  Robbing the rich or the black man's better day.  Wow.  That's just crazy if you think for a sec.  What?  Yeah.  Now why the f*** would I want Anthony's check unless I'm getting to show me?  But you get to smell me.  Wow.  Radio show, yeah, that would sell me. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  But am I getting paid?  And how?  Obama's offended at night.  That's right.  Barack's Gonna Take Ant's Money.  And give it all up to me.  Barack's Gonna Take Ant's Money.  Barack's Gonna Take Ant's Money.  And give it all up to me.  Because I'm moving on up.  Barack's Gonna Take Ant's Money.  We're moving on up to me.  We're moving on up to me.  We're moving on up to me.  That's what you do.  You're a high profile radio coach.  Dude, I can't take this anymore. 
[00:58:00]  I can't take it.  It's the United Negro.  Call me a bun.  A drink in every bed in under 21.  So turn in your guns for the common dreams.  And the Starbucks for the great soda machines.  Gonna get me fired at the p***ing.  And Anthony's gonna have to take it on the chin.  I'm bumping in the crackers that don't stick clear.  It's the black man's time for terror and fear.  Don't worry about the mortgage.  Don't pay in your rent.  Obama's got your back.  Because he's having sex.  And when he's done improving my life. 
[00:58:30]  I'm gonna have more money than his sex life.  I'm not joking.  Give it on up to me.  We're moving on up to me.  Give it on up to me.  We're moving on up to me.  In this country, you've been allowed to voice that opinion.  And then have dialogue with other people who disagree with that opinion.  That's great.  It's a great thing.  But we've got to this point where you just can't do that anymore.  It's, um, it's, no. 
[00:59:00]  Hey, Obama president.  That's what the president's gonna do for you?  Now you can walk in front of white people's cars.  I'm sick of it.  You need a baby aspirin or something?  Shut the F up.  I was blind, but now I see.  Obama president, nah.  Barack gonna take in money.  Give it on up to me.  We're moving on.  We're moving on up, my b****.  Give it on up to me. 
[00:59:30]  Because we're moving on up.  Barack gonna take in money.  And give it on up to me.  We're moving on.  We're moving on up, my b****.  Give it on up to me.  We're moving on up.  That's why they make front page news.  Because they rarely happen.  What does happen is groups of b**** thugs will beat the crap out of white people and rob them.  That's the crap that makes page 17.  Anthony.  What?  Why don't you use the power of the media that you have to try to bring to you? 
[01:00:00]  I am.  I am.  Thank God I'm here.  Thank Jesus effing Christ.  I am here to spread my word.  You really gotta listen to Mary Ann.  She's making a very good point.  I sound crazy.  That's not bad, man.  Dude, you're painting yourself like you're this oasis in a desert of just fluidless mice.  I am fluidless mice. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, boo.  It's gotta...  What do you think, man?  Farrow and Buffalo came up with that.  That's great.  I like it.  Sounds old school.  That's a nice, catchy little, you know, Barack's gonna take Anne's money.  Unfortunately, it's true.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Barack's gonna take Anne's money.  House next door.  House next door.  Someone at 1598 Penciling Avenue. 
[01:01:00]  Daddy played the banjo underneath the yellow tree.  Neat.  It rang across the backyard, an old-time melody.  I loved to hear the music, I was only five.  I listened as his fingers made the banjo come alive. 
[01:01:30]  That's for you, Jimmy.  Any ideas?  Well, I was thinking it was Steve Martin, because he's a banjo player.  It's probably a very good one, actually.  That's a relevant instrument, by the way.  You nailed it.  Did I really?  Yes, Steve Martin's got a banjo CD that's coming out today that they're protecting.  It was very hard to find that track.  Why are they protecting? 
[01:02:00]  I don't know.  It's called Daddy Played the Banjo.  Who's singing?  Not Steve Martin.  It's not Steve Martin?  I think that's him.  I don't know if he's singing.  I heard it's not him singing.  Tim O'Brien sings lead vocals.  Cool.  What I ought to do, then, is steal those lyrics and just sing them in a French accent and see how he likes it.  That's a tribute.  Yeah, it's a tribute.  You're biting your lip. 
[01:02:30]  You all right?  Yeah.  I don't hate Steve Martin.  I just wish he'd leave the Pink Panther.  Leave Peter Sellers' body alone.  That's all Peter Sellers.  He's raping his dead body.  Yeah.  Was known for being the Pink Panther, and now you're making everyone forget.  And you've destroyed the franchise.  Yeah, you're making everyone forget about the great Peter Sellers.  It's going to be on SNL, by the way, this Steve Martin.  He's going to play some banjo songs for everybody.  God, if there's nothing worse than listening to than a goddamn banjo. 
[01:03:00]  I could deal with maybe one banjo song, maybe.  Once every decade.  You'll sit through them if you're at a theme park or something.  I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool.  All right, let's go on to something else.  You would never buy banjo music, would you?  No.  Jimmy's got a big announcement.  I've got a big announcement.  It's just a gig I'm doing.  It's Saturday, February.  He's got a big partner.  Saturday, February 21st, at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia.  I'm doing a gig with Artie Lang.  We might start up a tour, but we're starting with, it's Friday, January. 
[01:03:30]  Tickets go on sale Friday, January 20th.  The gig is Saturday, February 21st, at the Tower Theater in Philly.  It's me and Artie, and I think that Florentine may be on the show, but me and Artie are probably  going to just do some gigs together, which I've been wanting to do for a long time.  That's going to get some chatter going.  Well, yeah.  Very starting in the Philadelphia papers, like, oh, the two shows don't get along, but  Jim Norton and Artie Lang are friends.  You didn't mention that, did you?  Oh, yeah.  That's exactly what they said in the Philly paper.  I didn't even know it was in the paper. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, do the, uh.  Day late, a dollar's short.  God almighty.  It's going to get a little chatter going between the two shows.  Oh, my God.  But good for Jimmy.  There you go.  Tower Theater with Artie Lang.  When was it again?  It's Saturday, February 21st, and tickets go on sale this Friday, January 30th.  You can go to livenation.com, and, um, yeah, we've only done one gig together.  That was about six years ago as a benefit, so, uh.  Those tickets are going to sell fast, so.  Yeah, Tower Theater is about 2,300 seats. 
[01:04:30]  I think it should sell.  There you go.  Well, Malik is not enjoying the banjo music.  We're running it.  All right.  We can grab, holy Jesus.  Malik, you get a little wordy at times, so you got to kind of make it quick this time  around, because we got to take a break and get Louis C.K. in here.  What do you got, Malik?  Yeah, what's good, boy, boy?  Hey, yo, um, hey, listen, I want to bite your face playing that hip-hop song, yo.  Oh, I thought it was the banjo music.  Nah, man.  I would rather listen to that than that song that you played from that guy from Buffalo. 
[01:05:00]  I like his concept, but, yo, that's just the most typical hack rap song I've ever heard.  How can you tell, though?  It did sound like, you know, old school.  How can you tell?  How can I tell?  Come on, and you know what?  How can you tell one good rap song from a bad rap song?  Let's be honest with each other.  It's kind of like country music.  What makes a country song good, and what makes a country song bad?  Same concept with rap music.  Well, Blondie started rap.  Yeah, everyone knows that. 
[01:05:30]  Nah, because it was just, the way, the production, it was just, yo, it was bad all the way around.  You know what?  I say it was fat.  See, because I thought it was the banjo music, because I think banjo music to black people  is like a Slim Whitman to the aliens in Mars Attacks.  They hear it, and their heads just explode.  That's right, because if we can't move to it, then it ain't no music.  Yeah, holla.  I hear that.  All right, so all right, my brother.  All right, Malik.  All right, punch it out, though.  As a matter of fact, a movie you guys should watch, Fralty. 
[01:06:00]  That's a good movie.  I've heard it, but I've never seen it.  Okay, I saw that one.  We'll check it out.  Thanks, Malik.  I'm sure I saw that one.  All right, punch it out, please.  We'll have more time for you next time, but we've got Louis C.K. standing by.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  We're very happy.  It's Opie and Anthony.  People were asking me just recently, where the hell has Louis C.K. been?  And here he is.  What a coincidence.  On the television.  He doesn't have time for us. 
[01:06:30]  He's becoming a big star all over the place.  Right beyond you.  All I hear are raves about your special, too.  Oh, thank you.  Everybody's like, oh, my God, I saw Louis special and chewed up.  It was amazing.  Unbelievable.  Still available on demand, too.  Yes, sir.  How you been, Lou?  I'm real good.  How are you?  You were just talking about cars and how amazing it is that you can pretty much just steal a car.  I think it's called stealing at this point.  The ad was, like I said, $500.  Yeah, we just had an ad. 
[01:07:00]  You get a car for, like, $5.99 or something.  Yeah, why not?  $500.  Go ahead.  Please just buy something off my lot.  I'm starving.  My kids are dying.  No way.  We're doing real well.  No, and GM stock is down to what it was in, like, World War II now or something?  Or World War whatever?  I've bought.  I've been buying that one.  Really?  Yep.  Is that a good idea?  Buy, buy, buy.  Who knows?  It's a stock market.  It's a dollar.  You own the company.  It's like going down the track.  Who cares? 
[01:07:30]  Bet on a horse.  A little bit of a long shot.  Buy a GM vehicle for $500.  Or better, yeah, just buy GM.  Yeah.  For $700.  That's what I do.  I think I'm a 51% shareholder now.  Yeah.  Everyone else dumped.  I bought it.  And I'm running the company.  You're back to day trading, I noticed.  Why?  You're getting some nice little deals there or what?  No, I'm keeping things longer than I have.  And when are you going to pass the savings on to your pal?  Because you're in the know a little bit, it looks like.  I'm not really in the know.  It's a lot of, you know, use the force, Luke, kind of things I do. 
[01:08:00]  Back and forth.  You know, only use risk capital.  Yeah.  You're like those Arabs in the beginning of the movie Patton, just looking through the  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Looking through the pockets of dead soldiers.  Yeah, you might find something.  That's why I'm going to make a little money at other people's expense.  I don't care.  Find a pair of dice and an old cult.  What you do is, you know, the stock goes down, you buy some call options, and you wait for  it to go up.  You buy some put options, you wait for it to go down.  It's very volatile right now.  There are stocks that, if you look, move up and down big swings on weekly, at least 
[01:08:30]  weekly basis.  Sure.  You look at a stock like Google, on a weekly basis, that thing is swinging sometimes 16  bucks a day back and forth.  Yeah.  So if you buy puts and call options on it, you're not paying the full price for the stock, and  then you wait for the thing to tank, and then you cash in.  So it's that easy.  We should all be doing it then.  The stock's making money, it's losing money, I'm making money, I don't care either way. 
[01:09:00]  It's like the guys that work in a morgue and they have a death pool.  Right.  Like every day, amongst the cancer patients.  That's how many dead people they're bringing in today.  Why should I care?  By the terminal ward, I guess.  Why should I care?  Make money.  It's actually smart.  You're doing a benefit tomorrow at Caroline's?  Caroline's, yeah.  In New York.  For PlayStation 3?  That's crazy.  It's a benefit for PS3.  PS3 is smart.  I love PS3.  I gotta go there and come out. 
[01:09:30]  I need one.  Yeah.  It's a kid's school.  It's my daughter's school, public school 3.  What the hell is wrong with your school?  You're giving back.  What's wrong with your kid's school?  All the money's going away.  Really?  Yeah.  No, the city's cutting all the budgets.  That's true.  Wow, that's a nice thing of you.  Well, it's my kid's school.  All right, it's always a little selfish.  If I had no child in the school, I would throw rocks at it.  Yeah.  Just to be mean because it's funny.  I didn't care less about someone else's stupid, ugly child and his education. 
[01:10:00]  See their awful drawings knocked out of the window?  Yeah, exactly.  No, and I've earmarked the money for just my daughter's care.  No other child is allowed to access a penny of it.  She has a brand-new computer.  They're eating dust mites.  Yeah, exactly.  She's being taught by a Harvard professor just one-on-one in the classroom.  And do you go to, like, your daughter's stuff at school, like recitals?  Because Anthony ruined it for every parent out there.  We were just talking about this yesterday, how you go there and you think your kid's special 
[01:10:30]  and the reality is they just suck.  No standout talent at a friggin' fifth-grade recital or anything like that.  There's no standout talent.  It's horrible.  You go to a school play, none of them can sing or dance.  They just suck.  Once in a million, you're going to get a talented kid.  Yeah.  Well, it's not, you don't go to enjoy the show.  I mean, it's really narcissistic, stupid parents that shouldn't have had kids that hope their 
[01:11:00]  kids are good at something.  That's not why you go, you don't go because, like, oh, my kid has maybe gifted at singing.  No, your kid stinks.  Well, can I?  But you're making your kid feel good by going.  That's why you go.  Yeah, that's why you go, so they can look out and go, where?  They're all looking and gawking.  Do the show.  Don't look for your parents.  It's like, that's another thing that just wrecks everything.  You know way too much about this.  It's Elwood Junior High's production of Grease.  Fantastic.  Got to listen to a musical of people that can't sing. 
[01:11:30]  Little fifth-grade kids singing about getting laid.  Yeah, yeah, things like that.  Sexy dancers in the Chick Shack.  Is it bad if the children don't sing well to hit them in the dressing room?  I think that would probably straighten out those vocals.  They come back out, their face is all pink.  They've got water in their eyes.  Yeah, beat them.  Being slapped.  The costumes suck.  The sets suck.  Yep.  Because they're all made by, you know, the kids.  They put them, all right, well, you're not in the play, but we'll make you in charge of the sets. 
[01:12:00]  And it's just that horrible paint on construction paper.  And the lighting kid is some dope up in the top.  And he can't even keep the spot on the star.  There's horrible productions.  And non-union.  Non-union.  That must have been it.  That's the problem with that.  That's the thing.  Yeah, but then people, like, got all mad at me because, like, they go to their kids' shows  and then realize, oh, my God, this does suck.  Yeah.  Like, you take out the fact that you're a kid.  I don't know why they're bringing you.  I don't know.  If you don't have, if it's not your kid, you shouldn't bring other grown-ups and make them go. 
[01:12:30]  Because it's a support thing.  It's not, it's not for the, but I go, I might, I go with my daughter on trips with the school.  Oh, the field trip.  Oh, okay.  On field trips, all chaperone.  And I go sometimes and I volunteer for lunch recess because that's a mess.  There's nobody there doing it.  Right.  So the kids, kids don't get to, they get 10 minutes to eat and 20 minutes to play and that's it.  They're back every day.  It's too crowded.  Back into their cells.  Yeah, it really is like a prison cafeteria. 
[01:13:00]  But I went on a trip once to the Botanical Gardens in the Bronx with my kids.  Oh, Bore Fest.  Yeah.  Holy plants.  Holy plants.  That's going to hold a bunch of first graders' attention.  But so we go up there and we're on a bus, on a school bus.  And it kind of gave me an insight into how the system works because the school bus, I think of it as like it's the school's bus company.  These people drive school buses for the school.  It's just a bus that the teacher called in, a yellow bus driven by some idiot. 
[01:13:30]  I mean, it's like, so we get on the bus and the guy turns to me.  I'm the first parent behind him and he goes, do you know how to get there?  What?  Yeah.  He asked me, do you know how to get there?  I'm like, no.  And he goes, can you find out how to get there?  So we're in the West Village.  Dude, I never remember stuff like this when I was there.  Yeah.  So I call up on my phone.  I say, just go to the Bronx.  We're going to the Bronx.  So we're on the West Side Highway and I call the lady, I call the Bronx Botanical Gardens and I go, hi, I'm in a school bus full of children on the West Side Highway. 
[01:14:00]  I need to know how to get to you.  And the lady says, you can't take a school bus on the West Side Highway.  That's illegal.  And I say this, this is a true story.  I say this to the parent next to me and she goes, yeah, this is not okay.  This is really bad.  And it occurs to me, I've never seen any large vehicle on the West Side Highway.  Oh, now that you mentioned it.  And when it gets up into the Bronx, it's twisty and turny and it's not okay.  And you're forced into a high speed of traffic because it's crazy. 
[01:14:30]  And so we go under an underpass and I swear to God, we scrape the top of the bus.  The whole bus goes grrrr and shake.  And I swear to God, the bus driver yells, oh, shh, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, crap.  What you yell when that happens.  Yeah.  And then the rest of the underpasses, he kind of ducks his own head down, really.  Like he kind of crouches.  And so the arch in the middle, it's a little higher.  But we got up there and nobody, you know, I brought waters. 
[01:15:00]  I asked the teacher, like, should I get a bunch of bottles of water?  She's like, I guess.  And I thought, well, that's because I'm like over-parenting.  No, it's because she just didn't care if people are in water.  And nobody brought sunblock.  A lot of kids died.  It really was like.  That just sounds like abuse.  Yeah.  What the hell?  It was a disaster.  But you know what?  The kids, we packed these kids, these heated, it was like summertime, these sweltering hot  kids unfed into a little tiny classroom. 
[01:15:30]  They take you to these beautiful places and they pack you into a classroom and you have  to listen to somebody.  Oh, gosh.  But the woman showed them how a seed becomes a plant.  Yeah.  Totally riveted audience.  Oh, really?  Totally fascinated.  She was killing.  Yeah, she was killing.  I learned a lot.  Yeah.  About how plants are.  Well, I didn't know that an apple is food for the seeds inside of it.  I thought it was.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  I didn't either, nor do I care now that I do.  I hate apples even more now. 
[01:16:00]  I remember field trips when I was a kid going out on a field trip and you'd have to get your  permission slip and your parent would sign.  But I used to like having my mommy go on there because I was such a mommy, boy, crybaby, little  wimpy girl.  I was.  And I used to like my mommy to go.  Yeah.  But the really bad thing is I used to make her dress up like a whore.  What?  Like I really used to make her dress up like a whore.  What do you mean you made her dress up? 
[01:16:30]  Wear those pumps, mom.  Like you'd make her.  No, worse.  Because it was like the early 70s and stuff.  And my mother was, she worked in like nightclubs.  She was a go-go dancer and stuff like that.  Like my mom had it going on.  There was a whore there.  Back in those early days.  Yeah.  So I'd go like, could you wear those, the knee-high boots and the red patent leather mini skirt?  And could you put your hair in pigtails?  And I swear, and she would do all this.  Wow.  She'd put her hair in pigtails and all the like kids would be like, your mom is so pretty. 
[01:17:00]  And I felt like good.  Like I felt all good.  And we went to go see, you're a good man, Charlie Brown.  At Radio City Music Hall.  And mom is a field mother.  And she wakes up that morning.  We're supposed to leave.  And she goes, Anthony, I'm so sick.  I'm so sorry.  I can't go.  I start crying.  And she's like, all right, all right.  I'll do something. 
[01:17:30]  So she's swigging Pepto-Bismol.  She was hung over to the point where she's puking.  She got a horrible hangover.  Now she's got to get whopped.  Bah, bah, on some decely bus dressed like a slut.  With her daughter's son.  Yeah, with her crying daughter's son.  Her boy girl is in the passenger seat.  And we get there, and I'm making her, you know.  I thought you meant her daughter's son.  Like Sarah Palin. 
[01:18:00]  Like her daughter had a kid, and she was covering her.  No, Palin's kid had more dignity than this.  I was just like, drop of a hat.  And I was whimpering and weeping as a child.  So when she said she couldn't make it, I was just, ehhh.  I lost my mind.  She had to go and get her hair in pigtails and get the friggin' patent leather miniskirt  with fishnets on.  Pigtails for mom, huh?  I made her put in, I go, put in the pigtails.  Oh, this explains a lot, doesn't it?  No kidding.  No.  What's going on in your head? 
[01:18:30]  God.  Oh my God, I didn't even make that connection to you who said that.  Oh boy.  It's so weird, backwards.  How do you think?  Well, most people end up screwed up because they were molested by their parents, but you  are screwed up because you molested your parents.  I was trying to molest my parents.  It's totally opposite.  Yeah.  I was trying to molest my mom at the time, I guess.  Wow.  Dressing her up.  Did you like kids' music growing up?  What?  Did you like kids' music growing up, like little children's songs?  Yeah, I think I did.  Like for a certain portion of my life. 
[01:19:00]  Not like in a 12.  Three Thirsty Mouse.  Shut up!  You set up bastard.  Set up his own joke.  You set me up ass.  I bombed before with a Thirsty Mouse joke.  Jimmy's really letting me forget it.  Work it the rest of the day.  Yeah, I was wondering why you were as like, that's not really that pertinent.  Oh no, believe me.  It was Nagasaki all over.  No, I started going to the trips.  I started going to the trips with my kid because the teacher asked me to because they'd go 
[01:19:30]  to a show.  And my daughter can't take a show.  She gets really upset.  Why?  Drama.  Really?  She gets really, really upset.  Where does that come from, you think?  I don't know.  She takes things really to heart.  She's very sensitive.  How old?  She's seven now.  But it's been like that her whole life.  Like when she was three, I showed her a Charlie Chaplin movie, Hard Times.  And she loved watching him fall down.  It was fun.  Yeah.  And then there's this scene where him and this other, he's poor in the movie. 
[01:20:00]  A little violin music starts.  Yeah.  It's really sad.  And him and this poor girl.  It's not like he had an expressive face.  No.  He and this poor girl break into a department store and start playing husband and wife in  the department store.  And she says, are they married?  And I'm like, well, they're pretending they're married.  She thinks that's so cool.  And then the cops come and they arrest him.  Oh, no.  And she just starts bawling. 
[01:20:30]  She was so sad.  I find that hysterical.  Kids are stupid.  She's so sad for their lives being broken up.  He's going to jail.  And also, she's also sad for America in the Depression.  Like, that's the.  Wow.  Like, she just felt all of that.  That kid's too perceptive.  Yeah, she knows too many.  Maybe she said her dad didn't bring home some cartoons and instead indulging his own  whimsy with a Chaplin film.  That's absolutely right, Jim.  That's absolutely right.  She's picking on the world's problems at an early age.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:21:00]  But so we, the teacher asked me to go to trips because she would always scream and run  out of the room when stuff happened in these shows.  People are saying she cried less than me, though.  Yeah.  Well, I used to try to talk her out.  Like, we went to a show once with these little puppets, and it was a moment that was really  a little over the top, like they overdid it.  Some puppet goes, those look like rubies.  Oh, no.  It's a dragon's eyes.  The reason the puppet starts screaming and gets eaten, and my daughter, the scream that 
[01:21:30]  she let out with her, like, hands over her ears is something I'll never forget.  I'll never forget it.  Jesus.  It is the most frightening sound.  It was the sound of somebody being killed.  Ugh.  Really?  And so I dragged her out.  Beat the crap out of her.  Where else I just started hitting her.  I don't know.  I just wasn't thinking.  I was just hitting her.  Who thought it was okay that a kid could see something like that?  I don't know.  I mean, the other kids are, like, bored because they play, you know, PlayStation.  Yeah.  So they kill hookers on their TV all day. 
[01:22:00]  So they can handle something like that.  Yeah, dragon, right.  Of course, it makes Anthony cry.  He's an almost-  You're hurting my mommy.  Leave my mommy alone.  Why are you hitting my mommy with a crowbar?  Grand Theft Auto.  Who's a good father?  Oh, Marari.  So wait, what happened?  Oh, so I took her outside, and I'm trying to...  I feel like I felt at the time that my job as a father is to break her of these fears.  And I'm saying, look, if you're going to be able to enjoy some things, you got to... 
[01:22:30]  This isn't fear.  This is about being thrilled.  And she goes...  But she argued forcibly and just said, no, I don't like being scared.  When somebody scares me, I get mad.  I don't like it.  I don't like when they do something scary without telling you it's going to be scary.  And I don't see why anybody would want to feel that way.  Like, she made such a case that I was like, I got to respect this, you know?  And it just went, no, no!  Don't look behind you. 
[01:23:00]  All right, listen, we got to take a quick break.  Louis C.K.  Yeah, that's something.  What a perceptive kid, though.  Yeah.  She's really smart.  It's been a long time, Lou.  Tomorrow night, you got the benefit for the PS3.  It's a kid's school.  It's Louis C.K.  But it's just me doing my hour and plus comedy.  I'm not...  Nobody's educated.  I hate when you do a benefit and they have to educate you, too.  No, we got...  We're here.  We paid the money already.  It's just a show.  It's just me doing a show at Caroline's.  That's good to hear.  And now we're going to hear why Louis is here.  We are here today to get... 
[01:23:30]  Please donate.  We did.  Yeah, shut up.  Tomorrow night, Caroline's, this is going to be huge and it's going to sell out.  So get your tickets now.  212-757-4100 for Louis C.K. tomorrow night.  And then Saturday, March 14th, down the road a little bit.  They're not going to remember this, so they should just go to louisck.net for all your  tour dates.  But he's playing in the Orpheum Theater in Boston on March 14th.  That's a huge show and I'm probably taping it for my next special.  Really?  Yeah.  Another special you're in? 
[01:24:00]  Ow.  You guys are crazy.  I'm really happy for you.  What's the...  Do you have a name for you?  I don't know.  Hilarious, which is the tour I've been...  That's the name of the tour I've been doing.  Cool.  So I'm done with it.  I'm going to shoot it probably in Boston, 99% sure.  If not, then one city down the road.  And then I'm done with that material.  We've been talking about how we ruin things for listeners.  You ruin the word hilarious for me.  Yep.  Yeah.  Because I saw you do your hilarious bit.  Right.  And I'm not going to attempt to do it here.  Right.  And I'm like, God, he is... 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  That observation is great.  It's hilarious.  Just the overuse of the word that people...  Yeah.  I'll say that much.  Yeah.  How people just use that word.  No, all the words amazing and genius.  Yeah.  You know.  When it's not amazing.  No.  It's not hilarious.  Yeah.  Just wait.  It's like that.  Dude, the chicken wings are amazing.  Really?  You were amazed?  Were you actually amazed?  Or you want to maybe like take it down and describe what they tasted like?  You got any descriptive words?  Jackass?  Amazing.  And if you can't remember what the chicken wings tasted like, ask the mice. 
[01:25:00]  What are you going to do when you see a ghost, you know, lifting a mountain?  What are you going to say about that?  That was exactly like the chicken wing I had.  Jackass.  Piece of crap.  Hateful people.  Sorry.  Jumped in the middle of your line.  It was stupid.  No.  It's all right.  The mouse thing was hilarious.  Yeah.  That was amazing.  You're a genius.  You're a genius. 
[01:25:30]  I'm going to cry.  More with Louis C.K. in just a bit.  Stay there.  We got Louis C.K. in studio today.  He's playing Caroline's tomorrow night.  212-757-4100.  I got to be honest, Lou.  No one cares that it's a benefit for your kids' school.  It doesn't matter.  They just want to laugh, and they're going to go there and laugh because you're great.  That's all that matters.  In the end, the school will do well, though.  It's fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm raising a lot of money.  I'm actually kind of bummed because now that the tickets are selling, I'm like, 
[01:26:00]  I could have kept that and given them, like, half.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I already, you know, said I'd give them a little off the top.  You know, Caroline's is being cool, too.  They're taking, like, five bucks a person, and that's it.  So it's all going to the school.  Good.  It's all good.  And, Louie, what were you going to say?  I was just going to say, I wish Louie would have brought something in today for me to  buy.  Every time you come in, like, last time, it was that goddamn flip camera.  Yeah, flip camera's awesome.  I ran out and got that thing and love it.  Yeah.  And I was like, God, and I have to tell everyone, I'm like, you know, Louis C.K.  was onto this a lot because then it became, like, everybody got one for Christmas and 
[01:26:30]  everything.  Like, Louis C.K. was onto this one.  A while ago.  Turned me onto it.  Yeah.  And the bastard turned me onto it before they came out with the next model, so I had two.  Yeah, so do I.  I have the HD and the non-HD.  The regular one, the non-HD one, I use, I put, I roll it out on my targets at the range  and shoot real close to it so you get the front view of what it's like at a range to  be down at the other end, the business end of the range.  That's awesome.  So if I hit it one day, you know, who cares? 
[01:27:00]  Where's that video?  Oh, there's one.  It's on YouTube.  Very cool.  It occurred to me that the success of those devices, it must make it easier for people  who, like, murder people and then tape it.  Yeah.  Like, they used to, that's what Polaroid film was created for those people.  Just a horrified woman's face half naked in that awful Polaroid.  In HD.  Yeah.  Now you get it like in HD.  Hear her scream.  Yeah, exactly.  And it's not with a clumsy camera on his shoulder. 
[01:27:30]  No.  Just holding it with one hand, holding her mouth closed with the other.  You know, if only Hogan had lived long enough, he would have been so amazed at the technology  of the day for pornography and being clubbed over the head with a tripod.  Whatever the hell.  He was motivated.  Hogan!  He was motivated.  He had to set up that tripod and get everything just right, get the lighting right.  Oh, was he fantastic.  He was a bad boy.  Dirty, dirty boy he was.  Because Louie was saying that he's had a few radio interviews he wants to talk about 
[01:28:00]  really quickly.  Because he goes around the country and he's on a lot of radio shows.  Yeah, everywhere.  Are we one of the better ones, Lou?  Oh, yeah, the best.  I mean, isn't it?  Well, you have to say that because you're here now.  No, I wouldn't do that.  If he doesn't, I wouldn't do that.  Oh.  And then someone else is going to call you out like, oh, come on.  I was just saying it because, you know.  Yeah, who am I offending that I care about right now?  Neil Bortz.  Neil Bortz.  I don't know who that is.  But no.  Well, both of these things happen on shows that I like, actually. 
[01:28:30]  But I don't even remember.  The first one was, just see if you can guess who the person was in the room that did this  in each show.  You don't know the names, but the type of person it was.  Yeah.  I'm talking about, once I was talking about my ankle being worn out, it's a bit that  I did.  Heather Mills.  And I go, I don't even understand that.  Septic model.  Exactly.  Just talking about people with no legs.  Oh, okay. 
[01:29:00]  No legs?  You said ankle, so I was assuming.  Oh, ankle.  Oh, my God.  Really?  I didn't say it was a home run, though.  But I didn't realize it.  Better than a thirsty mouth.  What?  Thirsty mouth?  Thirsty mouth.  No.  I think it's a thirsty mouth.  That's what I thought he said, too.  No, it's a thirsty mouth.  Maybe I ought to leave the mice jokes to Jimmy today.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  They're in his wheelhouse, I think.  Yeah.  No, I was talking about being 40, and now I'm 41, and how when you go to the doctor, 
[01:29:30]  they don't try to fix anything anymore.  I go to the doctor because my ankle hurt for three months, and the doctor just says, yeah,  your ankle's worn out.  That's all.  Wear a tear.  Take lots of a leave.  Yeah, that's what he said.  And I'm like, well, what if I was an athlete?  And he says, well, you're not an athlete, so no.  So we don't have to worry about it.  We keep those options off the table.  And so I'm grousing about that and getting some laughs, and so a person in that studio,  this was on the radio, on the phone, goes, really?  Because I would think at 40, you would still be getting some solutions from the doctor. 
[01:30:00]  The hole.  Yeah.  Yeah, isn't that weird that it was?  The hole.  The chick.  I mean, and all the laughter stops.  Yeah.  That's, I would think that at 40, the doctor would still come up with some options for you there.  Thank you.  Why did you fun cut tonight?  And so there's a pause, and then I go, yeah, he didn't is what I'm saying.  Where I'm going with this is that he didn't.  That's the engine of this piece of comedy.  That's how it functions is that it didn't. 
[01:30:30]  Get it?  Dummy.  What are you helping by correcting the piece of comedy?  You would think.  The whole point of any piece of comedy is that you're inflating and exaggerating to a comedic effect,  so it's the easiest thing to cut the legs out from under it.  It's the easiest, stupidest, most worthless thing to do.  I hope you gave her this speech.  No, I didn't.  I packed all of that into, he didn't is what I'm saying. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  And I just sat there so mad, and then the rest of the interview, I'm just like, yeah, uh-huh,  and just answering questions, yes or no, and I just want to get off the phone.  Well, she doesn't understand because, again, we've said before that when certain holes just leak brains and humor out of them.  And that's why when they're on a radio show, they just get up and their seat has funny on it, but the mic has none in it.  No, it's like the fun of the show is a balloon, and she literally put a vagina on the side of the balloon and let the fun out. 
[01:31:30]  They insist on having the women part of these orange shows.  And then there was, that was somewhere in Pennsylvania, and I don't remember where.  And then there was a show in Albany, and it's a show I really like doing, but we're talking about my kids.  And I go, yeah, I've got two kids, and I'm divorced now, so I have my kids with me by myself all the time because we share custody.  And it's hard.  I have to have, like I had to take a dump the other day, and I had to do it.  Can I say that?  They're not going to.  Oh, yeah.  I had to do it with the door open because I got two kids to watch and nobody else is home, so I can't, unless I'm going to gather them into the bathroom to watch Daddy take a poop, I've got to have the door open while I'm watching the kids. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  And she goes, same person, basically, just keeps moving out of the cities within the same morning somehow.  Same genitals, different show.  Yeah.  She goes, really, because your daughter's seven, I would think that she could take care of herself while you're doing that.  Oh, my God, that's not the point, you idiot.  Oh, my God. 
[01:32:30]  That's not the point.  And I was so, I was like, well, yeah, and I went the other way with that one.  I'm like, okay, that's how you want to do your show?  Yeah.  I was like, yeah, no, I guess that's true.  I guess she could have.  You're right.  Just clothesline your jokes.  Why would the Jews go into the bar?  If they owned it, wouldn't they have been there already going over the books and the deliveries?  Yes.  Yeah, the guy who goes into a bar with a duck on his head and the bartender says, what do you want or something, and it's always the duck says something. 
[01:33:00]  Really, because I didn't think the ducks had the power of speech.  And why wouldn't the bartender comment on the duck as opposed to just speaking?  Really, just usually when I go to a bar, they don't even talk to me.  They just seem real busy.  They're an easier way to keep them from jumping on the bed.  Yeah.  Wouldn't a duck fall off?  They are horrendous when it comes to radio shows.  Oh, my God.  They're like Andy Rooney with breasts.  No, but here's the thing is that I know many, many funny women, and I don't think it's a female trait, but no man has or will ever do that. 
[01:33:30]  No.  In the history of my life.  You kind of know what's going on.  Because only a hole would be that dumb.  But as a sex, I don't believe that it's a trait.  On radio.  There's an improv, which is a boring art, but there's an art to it, which is called yes and.  That's the rule of improv.  It means that if somebody posits an idea, you don't say, no, because you've just destroyed the whole show. 
[01:34:00]  You say yes and.  You add something.  You accept their premise and you add to it and you keep building that way.  You don't just go, no.  I did improv once, and I just, just because I was, it made me look good and made them all look bad.  I was the no guy.  And I shut down every scene that started.  They're like, oh, sir, sir, where's, isn't this the restaurant where everybody's crazy?  I'm like, no, it's a fine restaurant.  There's nothing going on.  Oh, okay.  Could you please tell me where the silly restaurant is? 
[01:34:30]  I never heard of any place like that.  Why would anyone go to a place like that when they want us to eat something?  And everybody just, ugh.  But I got huge laughs.  I'll have the steak then.  That's hilarious.  Oh, is that great?  Screw them.  You think improv is a little bit, it is a little bit boring, isn't it, most times?  Yeah.  A lot of times I've seen improv, it's very good.  No.  All right.  Stupid holes.  They just wreck.  Why are they such a staple?  Oh, now it's in my eyes. 
[01:35:00]  But really, even more than that noise, it's that thing of questioning, what is the value  of that?  What do you think?  Are you, is this like the 60 minutes of my bits?  Yeah.  Is this like you're exposing my bits so that they won't work and your show will be boring?  I went to Louis C.K.'s bit and found he wasn't being completely accurate.  We visited this doctor that has done much work on 40-year-olds.  It turns out he offered many solutions to Mr. C.K., which he did not bring up during the 
[01:35:30]  comedic bit.  I went in with a hidden camera and said I have a problem ankle.  Stop it.  He offered me a lot of solutions.  No, no.  It's not funny.  Yeah, there it is.  The hole.  You know, you're right.  Oh, Anthony.  Oh, you know you're going to go to hell for this.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  Yeah, that's the one.  I don't get it.  Oh, God.  Uh-huh.  That's the best one. 
[01:36:00]  It's like, oh, guys, like, stop the craziness now.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Now, guys, let's not make fun of people.  Yeah, that's the number one rule.  Let's just not make fun.  Yeah.  Anyway, yeah.  The devoid of humor, and if there are people that are funny in the room, it's just over. 
[01:36:30]  And I don't know why program directors or shows think it's a good thing to have that.  We were told so many times, you guys, I think maybe a girl in there, a woman, her side, her  point of, no.  Why do we want that on this show?  Well, if you stumbled upon a woman who is really funny and added things, then maybe you'd put  her on the show.  But to have somebody for, because that's the way they get put in is, okay, and you're here  to be on the give the women a side of the show, which has to be contrary, has to be just 
[01:37:00]  worthless and shutdown-y.  Because the women will look at you like you're keeping them.  Yeah.  The guys think they're in charge, but we all know.  Oh, we all know.  We're really in charge here.  Gang rape on the console.  Show her who's boss.  We just like doing horrific things to women on our show.  Not having them as an equal to what we're trying to do every morning.  We're doing here.  Yeah.  All right.  What else is going on, Lou? 
[01:37:30]  We were talking about movies earlier.  A lot of good movies as the Oscars are right around the corner.  Jimmy and I separately saw Slumdog Millionaire last night.  I hadn't seen that yet.  Didn't you see?  No.  I saw The Wrestler, and I loved that.  The Wrestler was awesome.  That was the scene where he's with the guy with the staple guns and all that.  That was like the...  I mean, and they even mention it in the movie The Passion of the Christ.  It really was that horrifically, but really good.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, and Mickey allowed them to abuse his body for that movie. 
[01:38:00]  That's obvious.  I saw an interview with him where he said he didn't want to do any of it.  He had to train for three months, and he's like, I hate wrestling, and I just thought  it was stupid.  He didn't like the script.  Really?  They told me I had to go...  Darren wanted me to go away for three months to this camp, and I was like, no, I'm not  doing this.  But I love that he admits that now, because it shows that he was dead wrong.  It was worth it.  Yeah, yeah.  It was the best thing he ever did in his whole life.  Yeah.  Better than Rumblefish, Lou? 
[01:38:30]  Comment.  That's the weirdest movie I ever saw, Rumblefish.  I know.  It's very strange.  What's that?  It's the sound of Anthony.  No, I'm like...  I'm reading Pal Talk, people.  All right.  It's racist.  We can take a break and continue here.  Can I say a big...  With some other things?  Yes, Jimmy.  Big thanks to my friend, Ann Coulter, for sending me such a nice email about my hand  in the appearance.  It was very sweet.  That's all.  How? 
[01:39:00]  I don't like the friends you have.  You're friends with Ann Coulter?  I am.  Really?  Like, how are you friends?  You go out and you hang out together?  No, we hung at the Comedy Cellar, and we emailed sometimes, and we interviewed her here,  and...  It's me.  Yeah.  It's Ann's girlfriend.  Why am I...  No, no, no.  It's the female version of Anthony.  She's not my type.  I'll tell you the truth.  I just like her mindset too old.  She's just not funny.  She tries to be funny.  She's not funny.  I just...  I'm attracted to her.  Oh, you are?  Oh, yeah.  Big time. 
[01:39:30]  I am.  Any chance?  No.  No.  I'm attracted to her in the way that I'm just...  I'll have sex with anybody in the world, including a dead child that I found.  That's how I'm attracted to her.  You say you're not sure why that makes you feel...  Well, Ann wants emails from Ann Coulter.  Yeah, I'm not sure why I get so upset when...  That's all.  If Ann gets an email from Ann Coulter, he'll be very happy.  Important famous people know Jimmy.  I'll tell you what. 
[01:40:00]  It's because you're awed by my humility.  Sometimes when you realize, like, oh, my God, I'm sitting next to this special person,  and I didn't know it, and he never acts special.  Is that what it is?  I don't know.  That's just what my guess is.  I agree.  It could be nothing of the kind.  I agree.  It could just be that Ann thinks that I'm a no-talent pile of feces and shouldn't get  any accolades.  Oh, Jimmy, I would never think that.  You're on our show.  You have been for years.  Why would I think that you're not funny? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, my God.  My mouth is...  My mouth is dry.  All right, let's go to break.  More with Louis C.K.  As we go to break, we'll play a little clip from Hannity last night.  Norton did a great job for Sean.  Opie and Anthony.  Why is that?  Hold on, hold on.  You work on Opie and Anthony's show on their radio program.  Look, there are people that did shut them down, want to shut them down.  They want to go after Imus.  They want to go after Rush.  They want me dead.  And it's like you can't tolerate an alternative. 
[01:41:00]  You put whatever happened to free speech liberals.  Liberals have become such whinging babies about anybody who calls them out publicly.  Obama has used tougher language on Rush than he has on Hamas.  Who cares what Rush Limbaugh says or any other political pundit?  They're just people...  I care what I say.  I care what you're the exception of the rule.  Oh, yeah, no, all right.  Because I'm here, I'm saying that.  No, but Obama shouldn't.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:41:30]  Louis C.K. in studio today.  Caroline's tomorrow night.  It's a benefit, but you don't have to worry about that.  Who cares?  Go there to laugh.  And it will help Louis' kids' school.  But there's going to be no preaching.  Just some fine comedy from Louis C.K. tomorrow night at Caroline's.  212-757-4100.  What song is this?  This is rap.  Day Tripper, yeah.  It's round and round.  Right? 
[01:42:00]  Yep.  877-212-0&A.  Day Tripper, I always thought it was Date Ripper.  Date Ripper.  Date Ripper, yeah.  You're stupid.  Let's play that up.  Why?  Because I figured I wanted to say something that had no comedic value whatsoever.  And mission accomplished.  Round and round.  What else is going on in the world today?  It's kind of a slow news day.  We were going to try to talk about the Super Bowl, but I don't think it doesn't have the 
[01:42:30]  buzz this year, really.  It's probably going to be one of the lowest rated ever.  It's going to be one of those things.  No one cares.  Everyone's broke.  Yeah.  Worried about their own jobs than a stupid football game.  We're still having the Super Bowl.  I think it's a sign we're okay.  We're okay.  We're okay.  All right.  There's a lot of fat we could trim that we haven't yet.  Yeah.  Like, we're not doing that.  People are panicking.  Like, emotional fat?  I mean, like, we still have huge mountains of stuff we could lose before we're even close 
[01:43:00]  to being like Canada, even, before we're anywhere near a normal country, before we stop being  the gilded city on the hill.  Right.  I mean, we have hot dog eating contests and funny car races.  We're fine.  Yeah.  Until that stuff starts going away.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  No.  The Super Bowl with fireworks and some idiot's going to play in the halftime. 
[01:43:30]  And we're going to make believe we love the commercials.  Yeah.  And all the girls are going to spell something out with their vaginas.  We're fine.  We've got to stop panicking when those things go away.  Yeah.  That's a lot between that and everybody having a donkey with pots clanging on the sides  and a blanket.  You notice the homeless out there, though?  There are a lot.  Well, you know, and their population's grown a little bit in the last couple of months.  They're quick.  They're overnight homeless.  I figured out who some of these guys are, seriously.  Because I was on 14th Street, and I was actually high on marijuana pot, which I never do. 
[01:44:00]  Were you really, though?  I was really high.  Are you back on the dope?  I never, never get high.  If I go drinking, I'll have half a beer, and everybody makes fun of me, and then I hide  it somewhere.  Crazy.  I can't do any of that stuff.  But I went to see my friend Doug Benson, a comedian, who just is a giant joint.  He loves his pot, that guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I went and hung out with him, and I got high, and I need to get away from people  right away, because I'm high, and I can't cope with people. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  I just don't like the way my mouth and hands feel or look.  Or look.  Yeah.  People are looking at my mouth and hands.  So I go, and I...  Such a pot thing.  Yeah.  But so I go to the meatpacking 14th Street, you know, all the...  I just want to look at people, but I don't, because I also don't want to be alone, because  I don't want to kill myself.  You don't want to interact, though.  Yeah, I don't want to interact, exactly.  You go to the meatpacking district, then you don't like how your mouth and hands look  just around the hog of a tranny.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:45:00]  I hear you.  But that's now a big teeming nightclub scene.  It's crazy now.  Yeah, huge.  So I'm watching people walking around, and the fight's starting, and it's kind of interesting,  and there's a homeless guy perched on a mailbox like a crow, literally, like, you know, crouched.  Really?  Yeah, and he says, can I have some...  And he asked me for money.  And I looked at him, because he didn't look that...  He looked like a few...  Like, fresh homeless.  Looked a little too clean.  Yeah, he didn't have that many layers on him.  Like, you know, he hadn't slept that many nights out or anything, and so I asked him about 
[01:45:30]  his life and stuff, and he was Pakistani, and he worked for the city as a janitor,  and he said, just a matter of fact, he says, I have a problem where I see snails on my  hands and arms, and I need to cut them, and then I start to scream, and I can't really  keep a job when I'm like that, but I've got medication that keeps that from happening.  Like, he didn't say there are arms, there are snails on my arms.  He says, I see that sometimes. 
[01:46:00]  He knows it's not there.  That would have freaked me out.  But he really believes it when he sees it, so he takes pills that stave it off.  Did he work in a French restaurant, Lou?  It was like, those were snails.  So, that was horrible.  So, he, the city cut prescription drug benefits.  They just cut them, because, you know, Bloomberg's slashing.  And here come the snails.  And so, here come the snails, and it takes him two days to get fired. 
[01:46:30]  Two days with the screaming and slashing his own arms, and he's gone.  That'll do it.  That's it.  So, and, but he was otherwise, and he had it, like, in his bag.  He had a lot of these, you know, all his toiletries and clothes.  Like, he was trying to take care of himself.  He just was, you know.  Anyway, and then I kept running into homeless guys who looked okay and seemed the same kind  of borderline.  One guy stopped, and I had a Red Sox hat on, and he goes, ah, Red Sox.  And he knew everything about the trades and stuff.  I'm like, this guy's watching television somewhere.  You know, when you're, like, a homeless guy who's chatting with you about Lost, and you're 
[01:47:00]  like, this guy's going to be okay.  He's all right.  But then as he's talking to me about the Red Sox, then he starts twitching and going,  ugh, ugh, fine, bitch.  And then he ran away.  And I'm like, oh, poor guy.  He's just, he's two pills away from being fine.  Fine, but.  But those pills cost, like, $1,000 each, because this is the cruelest country in the world.  So, those are overnight.  Like, one day of prescription drugs going down in the city, and then 50,000 homeless  people with the exact same problem.  I'm with you. 
[01:47:30]  I love talking to homeless guys.  I love it.  Who's more fascinating?  It's like watching a movie.  Yep.  You don't know what you're going to get.  Their stories.  You've got to watch their hands, so they don't stab you or anything.  Yep.  But besides that.  Their stories are definitely going to be more interesting than most of the idiots that  you love in life.  People that, like, I literally feel love for.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to hear it.  Yeah.  But that guy, oh, really?  Snails in your hand?  Then he's from Pakistan.  He also had a really interesting story, because he came over here when he was 12 years old. 
[01:48:00]  He was, this is how a lot of immigration, this is how legal immigration works.  His family is, Pakistani family owns, like, 10 gas stations in Queens.  And his, like, distant uncle paid for him to come, like, sponsored him to come to the United  States, took care of all of his legal work, got him a green card.  And to pay for that, he works in the gas station from 12 years old to, like, 18.  Right, right.  Lives in the basement of the gas station. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Like, literally.  I'm like, gas stations have basements?  Yeah, wait a minute.  I lived in the basement.  It's just a bed and a lamp.  And he just sleeps, pumps gas.  Sleeps, pump gas.  Slave labor for, like, six years.  Like, maximum overdrive.  Yeah.  And then when he gets to 18, screw, go hit the streets.  And that's the life of a lot of these guys.  Why such a soil animal on them?  Why couldn't he have had a faster animal?  I mean, can't you get away from snails, you idiot?  Just walk away from them.  That was bugging me.  The fact that it's snails. 
[01:49:00]  That story, that's the one thing that bothered me.  It might have been worms.  I don't remember.  You should have thrown warm butter on them.  Snails.  They can't even really stay attached to you.  It's kind of creepy.  You just push them over.  Like, ew.  Exactly.  But it's not even leeching me.  You know?  Well, you get that feeling in your body, I guess, without those pills.  You just want to get mad at this.  Yeah.  You're right on it.  Wow.  Ugh.  Yeah, gross.  I need a pill.  Why don't they be homeless then where there's health care?  Like Canada. 
[01:49:30]  Well, because they had health care for a minute.  They had the pills here, and then they didn't.  Like, the second you get laid off then.  The second you get laid off, you look at your bottle.  You look at your little amber bottle.  You go, that's how much time I got left before.  Zero refills.  Worthless.  And then run up to Canada.  Yeah.  And get it there.  That's got to suck.  If subconsciously you know, all right, I'm sane as long as this.  Exactly.  As long as I got the pills in this bottle.  Here's my sanity.  And what happens?  You take that last pill and go, here they come. 
[01:50:00]  Here come the scales.  The scales.  That's got to.  I'd rather be crazy and not know it.  That's exactly it.  Because there are people out there that are crazy, and they understand it.  Well, because they're underwater.  The guys who don't know it are guys who just never got diagnosed or never got.  Right, right.  This guy took care of himself.  Yeah.  And then he just knows.  He goes, yeah, imagine that.  Going like, I know they're not real, but I'm not going to know they're not real.  Yeah, it's like flowers.  In an hour.  You know, it's one of those. 
[01:50:30]  Exactly.  My dad was one of these guys that had to help everybody, and he took in a lot of people,  and a lot of these people were exactly what you just described.  And there would just be crazy crap happening in the house, and we'd have to call their family.  Oh, I guess he's off his medication again.  Yeah.  Go in his room, find whatever the medication was, force it down his throat, and he'll be okay.  Yes, you're trying to kill me with poison.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, dude.  It's like, why are we dealing with this guy's problem?  In half an hour, you'll be like, hey, what's up? 
[01:51:00]  He's like, hey, thanks for giving me that poison.  I feel better.  I really needed that.  But we would be, you know, in a path.  You're with the CIA, and you're.  We had one of those.  Really?  We had one where he was convinced we worked for the government and that we were following him,  and he would go at it with my brother all the time.  I'm like, I know you're with the FBI or CIA.  You're following me.  I don't want you to follow me anymore.  My brother loses it.  Like, look, you know, I'm their son.  This is my house.  I grew up here. 
[01:51:30]  I'm doing some work around the house.  I'm not following you.  So fast forward about a week.  My brother's up in the attic, and he's doing some stuff.  I forgot.  He's doing some repair work, and he puts his foot through the ceiling, and he looks through  the hole, and there's the guy looking up like, see, I told you.  Oh, no.  True story.  Oh, no.  I told you.  You're following me.  I've always wanted to do that to those people.  Like, when I worked at Conan, I worked at 30 Rock, and there was, my window looked out  over this little plaza, and there was this crazy, wild, bearded man who would stand there 
[01:52:00]  with a Bible all day.  He smelled like you could smell him for a long time.  Yeah, yeah.  And he'd go, God said, this is the day.  You know, I'm here to tell everybody.  And we started fantasizing about getting, like, painting a car certain colors or something  and, like, pulling up and saying, you're right, get in.  Let's go.  We've got to get going.  Just totally fulfilling all of these crazies.  Wear some, like, officialoma badge and go, you're right, the president needs to see 
[01:52:30]  you right now.  I knew it.  Oh, okay, I'm ready.  Yeah, how would they react to that?  Like a crazy person?  Oh, well, I got my stuff in a cart around the corner, though.  Just throw them on Conan like that to tell a story.  Hey, didn't you, you had a cool, did you ever tell a Martin Sheen story?  I love that one.  Martin Sheen.  Oh, yeah, he was on Conan, and we did a bit with him, and I wrote a bit for Martin Sheen  to do on the show, Apocalypse Now, throwback bit. 
[01:53:00]  And so the publicist actually said he wants to hear the idea before he commits to it.  Makes sense.  So I called him on the set of Gettysburg or some movie he was making, and he was talking  to me as Robert E. Lee in character.  But here's the thing.  I've had guys do that before.  The thing is that he's talking to me as Robert E. Lee, the general, but he's discussing,  like, what time his flight gets in, like, you know, 20th century stuff.  Like, what's the...  Well, sir, I fly into LaGuardia, I believe. 
[01:53:30]  I'll have to leave my sweet Magnolia as I catch a connecting flight.  Catch a connecting flight through DFW and get a town call, sir.  Atlanta's burning.  Why, I gotta get down there.  I gotta go and take the space shuttle to...  That's hysterical.  But so then we get it.  He's in the dressing room, and I'm trying to talk him into the bit, because he said he  was going to think about it.  I'm trying to talk him into the bit, and he's... 
[01:54:00]  Me and the two producers are talking to him, and then this little kid walks by the door  of his dressing room, and he goes, that was one of God's little miracles that just walked  by our door, gentlemen.  And he's being, like, the president or something.  I don't know what the point of that was.  The West Wing kind of thing.  Yeah, it was one of God's little miracles.  Just walk by our door, gentlemen.  Without any sarcasm.  No.  And we're like...  Just with sarcasm, that's funny.  Yeah, exactly.  It's really funny.  And I'm still just trying to talk him into doing my bits. 
[01:54:30]  I'm like, oh, yeah, I know.  I love the children.  Well, does a kid have a hanger on his head?  Then maybe he's right.  A hanger-hooked lip, like, all jerked up.  I have two children, and I still think that that was a lot of crap.  Is that awful?  I still hate him for it.  That makes my head itch when I hear that story.  Oh, God.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Miracle?  Terrible.  Really?  Yuck. 
[01:55:00]  What's the miracle?  Both of your drug-taking miracles.  I aimed, I hit it, she came out.  Wow.  Ever did the bit?  What?  He did the bit.  He actually nailed it.  Yeah.  It was great.  It was just a bit we did called a two-way mirror in the dressing room.  We pretend that we had two-way mirrors.  Oh, okay.  So we'd catch them doing weird things.  And he was shaving, and he cuts himself shaving, and then he goes into the spiral,  you know, apocalypse now, Saigon dressing room thing.  Yeah.  Where he's just smashing himself against walls. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, it was good.  That was pretty cool.  John Grisham is on Good Morning America.  We did a book called The Associate.  And I love it.  What was that one he wrote about the young lawyer conflict?  I'd like to spit warm tea in his face.  Shut up with lawyers.  How about another concept?  There's a young lawyer, and he's up against it.  Something.  Yeah.  And, yeah, he's got to win this case.  Well, because he was, yeah, because to prove his father was, wasn't there a time where Tom 
[01:56:00]  Cruz, every movie he did was a guy who had something to prove because his dad was a maverick?  Of course, because his dad was something like that.  Every single one, the car racing, the lawyer, and the pilot.  But all three were a guy who, a lot of talent, but real self-destructive because his dad was  a real...  I flew at you, dad.  Let me tell you what happened.  Let me tell you what really happened.  It's classified.  Now let's go play homosexual volleyball with no shirts. 
[01:56:30]  Few good men, too.  What?  Few good men, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the one I said because he's a lawyer.  He's a good idiot.  Oh, okay.  He's a stupid idiot.  I didn't catch him.  Yeah, that's the one I meant.  I'm sorry.  I meant cocktail, where he played a lawyer in cocktail, didn't he?  His father was the best bartender there was.  Wow, all right.  Right there is one.  He's like bottles like crazy.  One of God's little flubs, gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  Oh, how did you react to that? 
[01:57:00]  Did you make a noise?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, totally.  Yeah.  Because I just really wanted to do my little dumb little bit.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Which I can't imagine, I can't fathom the motivation I had to do that job.  Now that I'm 41 and I do as little as possible.  Amazing.  Just waiting to die.  Talk Martin Sheen into doing your bit.  Mm-hmm.  You got to not only write the frigging bit and everything, but then sell it to the guy.  Mm-hmm.  That's good.  Oh, that's too much work.  That's horrible.  And then you got to listen to dribble like God's little miracle.  There were guys who I tried to, like, what's his name? 
[01:57:30]  Rip Torn, is that his name?  No, there's a Rip Taylor.  Rip Taylor, I don't know which one he is.  One's a shit, one's a queer.  Literally confetti-throwing queer.  Literally.  With no hyperbole.  No other way to look at him, right?  It's literally on his business card.  Oh, I see what's going on here.  Confetti-throwing queer.  That's funny.  He'd say that without the slightest malice.  He would answer to it without flinching. 
[01:58:00]  I think it's Rip Torn that was on the Larry Sanders show.  Oh, yeah, that's Rip Torn.  He loves his drink.  Yes, and he showed up to do a bit that we had, and he had funny teeth.  He wanted to put in funny teeth.  He wanted to.  Yeah, he said, I want to just put the funny teeth in and make funny noises.  I'm like, well, we have a bit written.  What?  Yeah.  And he was hammered.  He smelled like booze.  Oh, really?  And I'm talking to him.  I'm all 24 years old.  I don't even understand what he is.  And I just know he's famous.  I didn't even watch the show at the time.  And I'm like, will you do this bit? 
[01:58:30]  And he goes, well, I want to put in the funny teeth.  I got these funny teeth.  I'm like, well, this bit, we really prepared it.  It's probably going to be really good if you do that instead.  Well, I think my teeth are funny.  Oh, no.  I'm like, well, I'm not sure how the teeth.  And he goes, they never give me this kind of trouble on the Larry Sanders show.  I get to do what I want there.  And I go, yeah, go ahead and put the teeth and do whatever you want.  Just we'll cut to you, and you do whatever you want with those teeth, buddy.  And I thought, I'm letting this guy just hang out to dry on his own, because I don't care anymore. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  And then he did it, and it killed, and it was really funny.  I don't even remember what it was.  He knew what he was doing?  Yeah, he did.  You gave him the rope to hang him somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he did.  And he lassoed a red-headed punk with me.  Yeah, exactly.  I was so hoping for a good ending there.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, wow.  I thought that's happened before with Eve, the R&B artist.  I don't even have a sense of what she does exactly.  Eve, black woman who's famous.  Yeah.  Right.  I was working on the MTV Movie Awards, and I had to do patter with people. 
[01:59:30]  Like, I had to give people funny things to say off a teleprompter.  And the thing on awards shows, those stupid jokes are the best you can do.  That's why they're like that.  I've worked for those shows a few times.  The reason those jokes are so bad is because that's the highest you can possibly reach.  There's always good comedy writers on those shows that write really clever stuff.  It doesn't function on those shows.  And you can't do no jokes because it's just dead.  But if you've ever presented in an awards show, people are milling around. 
[02:00:00]  Nobody's listening to you.  Like, everyone's walking around and talking at other tables.  It's a mess.  Terrible.  There's no focus.  So, all you can do is squint.  And you should.  And I used to tell these stars this who look a little lost.  Look at the teleprompter more than you even have to.  Make it clear that this is our bad joke and not yours.  Oh, okay.  Don't look like you mean it because you're going to go down hard.  You're going to eat it.  This is really going to suck.  Squint. 
[02:00:30]  Put glasses on even if you don't wear glasses.  Yeah, exactly.  Put your hand over your eyes.  And do with your finger.  Like, can you roll that back again?  Yeah, roll it back.  But Eve was presenting with Vin Diesel.  That guy's good.  Wow.  He's terrific.  Vin Diesel wanted to do a bit.  He, like, showed up early to rehearse and said, I want to make sure.  I don't like ever to look like a fool.  I want to make this right.  And I know this is a comedy-based show.  Why do we make movies?  Why does he use that stupid name? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, exactly.  But we wrote a bit for him where he's up with Eve.  And she says, hey, Vin, is that your real voice?  And he goes, no, it's actually a fake voice.  And she goes, really?  Can I hear your real voice?  And he goes, okay.  And then he goes, even way lower.  And says, this is my real voice.  And I asked him, can you do that?  And he did it.  And he can go lower than he really is.  It's crazy.  So we're going to do it.  It's kind of a funny bit.  So he goes, they're coming from separate wings.  Nobody, Eve didn't talk to anybody until the second it's about to happen. 
[02:01:30]  And she's looking at it with me.  We're about to happen.  And she goes, I don't like, this is stupid.  I'm not going to do this stupid thing.  And I go, but Vin is expecting this.  He came to rehearsal.  No, I'm not going to.  I'm going to just go out there and say, how's everybody feeling?  Are we feeling the love?  And I'm like, yeah, go ahead.  I don't care.  Okay.  I like how Lou just gives people.  No, I don't care. 
[02:02:00]  Like, whatever.  Go.  Good.  Go, go.  Go look.  Kill yourself.  So she went out there.  And Vin, she said whatever she wanted.  And he kept reading the cards.  Oh, no.  I really wish there was a tape of it somewhere.  Oh, no.  So it's two completely different things.  Yeah, she goes, how's everybody feeling?  And he goes, yes.  Like, he answers.  He's doing his part.  And she goes, does everyone feel in the love?  And he goes, this is my real voice.  Holy shit.  And then they both look around like, what just happened? 
[02:02:30]  And then they go to a package of, you know, the clips.  Yeah.  The awards for, you know.  Yeah.  Wow.  And TV stuff.  And he was really upset.  He must have been.  He was almost crying.  That's how much he wanted that to go well.  Really?  Yeah.  He took it as a personal failure.  Was he mad at her?  No, he wasn't.  He was too dumb to be mad at her.  He's too dumb to realize she's the one.  He thought he screwed it up.  Screwed it up.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  So I hate her.  I really hate her.  Every time I see her, I hope she dies while I'm watching.  This is stupid. 
[02:03:00]  This is stupid.  Really?  Maybe you're stupid and ugly.  Wow.  Good God.  Do whatever you want.  Yeah.  Right on.  All right, listen.  We got a break.  That's so funny.  We'll do a little mopping up next.  We got Louis C.K.  He's doing Caroline's tomorrow night.  This is great.  212-757-4100 for tickets to see Louis C.K.  tomorrow.  All right?  That's exactly right, sir.  We'll finish up next.  We got to get out of here.  Got to move over to the other joint with Louis C.K., who's playing Caroline's tomorrow night. 
[02:03:30]  It's so funny.  You're playing that tomorrow.  I'm there February 5th through 8th.  That's so funny.  It's such a weird coincidence, because we're both comedians.  Yeah, I know.  It's a comedy club.  Right.  That's kind of what I was saying.  Really?  Because it seems counterintuitive that you'd want to...  I'm with you.  Yeah.  That's stupid old crap.  Most shows have them there, though.  Yes.  All right.  Anything else before we move on?  I think we're good.  Let me think. 
[02:04:00]  Nothing I had planned.  We did our job for the people out there.  Well, now we get to say, you know...  They're lucky we showed up.  That's right, Jimmy.  That's how I feel on a daily basis.  Hey, boy.  Lucky we're here.  Enough out of you.  Shut it.  Well, guys, I mean, we didn't get to the Obama...  The Congress of last in the city, because the jet got bought...  Well, the jet thing is pretty funny.  Barack Hussein.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, the jet thing, because Ann had a good observation how, like... 
[02:04:30]  Citibank, apparently, you know, part of the bailout.  Yeah.  The government gave them a lot of money, and they decided to buy a...  How much was that?  $50 million jet.  $50 million private jet for their executives.  That's what they do with the money?  Yeah, yeah.  What do people think these guys are doing?  Well, I think they think they're doling it out door to door.  We screw you out of some cash here.  So, they decided to get the $50 million private jet. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Scumbag.  A French jet, too.  It wasn't...  They didn't even buy an American jet.  But see, it's not even embarrassing.  It's just that's the way it is.  Yeah.  You know, like they gave the $350 billion so far to the banks, and they just said thanks,  and they just kept it, and they're not doling out loans.  They're not helping.  No, they're not fixing it.  They're buying jets.  They own everything.  They don't care.  They're raping the country.  They have never cared.  Apparently.  They have all the...  Like, there was that story once how an ATM machine got loaded wrong, so somebody put the  hundreds in the tens drawer. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And so, idiot moron Americans lined up around the block to get, you know, ten times their  money out.  Yeah.  As if the bank isn't just going to go and say, well, we know how much you took.  Give it back.  Jag on.  And Monopoly, who says bank are in your favor.  I get to keep that.  Exactly.  But that's...  And like the guys in the car companies that showed up in jets.  That's what those people do.  They're fat pigs.  They don't care about other people.  It wasn't... 
[02:06:00]  They didn't care before.  Why do you think they...  And then they show up in cars like, oh, great.  That means that they always just drove cars.  Yeah.  I think it's because...  That fixes it.  We never saw this, really.  Yeah, well, that's because we're stupid.  But we never really saw it.  We're seeing it now.  And now we're seeing it.  What's up with the corporate jet, though?  Obama's jumping on this thing?  Yeah, I think he's...  Basically saying, give the jet back.  What are you doing?  We gave you a bailout and stuff.  It's like...  But it is.  It's like your friend coming to you crying, going, I'm going to lose my house.  My kids are starving and stuff. 
[02:06:30]  I have no car.  I got to think...  You know, I need some money.  And then you give him some cash, and there he is, you know, in the brand-new caddy.  In the brand-new caddy.  Or loading...  Hey, how you doing?  Loading up his car with his brand-new golf clubs.  It's like, where are you going?  We're heading to the airport, man.  We're going to Disney.  But that's what those people were just...  Like, what?  Pure money-for-blood people.  They're not...  They really are disgusting.  Well, but that's...  If you're going to attack it and say that they should take a car to the Capitol and all that  kind of stuff, then you're a communist.  Which is... 
[02:07:00]  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  I think we should be more socialist, but you've got to be honest about it.  If you're saying that those guys should be, like, pinching pennies because their workers  are suffering, oh, I laid off eight guys today.  I guess I'd better, you know, trade in my gold toilet seat for something else.  That's socialism.  But if we give them money, I think that temporarily, at least, the government has the right to go,  all right, you know what?  If you want this money, you're going to spend it this way so we don't have to come and bail 
[02:07:30]  your ass out again.  That's socialism.  But if it's temporary, if it's temporary, I don't know, I don't think it is.  Temporary socialism.  I don't think it is because they're asking you for something.  Yeah, but you're replacing the Darwinist, Ayn Rand, capitalism model.  I don't know what Darwinist means.  You have to rephrase that.  I've got to go back, though, to Christchurch.  You're replacing that with responsibility to the people by those who, like, wield the most  power, which is corporations.  They have to suddenly be responsible to the people and act in a way that takes everyone's 
[02:08:00]  needs into consideration.  That's socialism.  Instead of just saying, get whatever you can and have that jet be incentive for their, you  know, just grab and grab and grab.  That's what this country is based on.  If they're back on their feet, then they can do what they want.  Like, in socialism, right, it doesn't work that way.  Like, once you get the money from the government, and once you're bailed out, now the economy's  better, you do what you want again.  Well, it's like Hong Kong socialism, how the Chinese maintain Hong Kong as this whorish  capitalism system, and they let it be there because they need the money.  Now they're doing it in Shanghai also, and they're doing it in every big city. 
[02:08:30]  Well, because now the communism doesn't work very well.  No, but they're blending it.  They're blending communism with capitalism, which is what we're going in the other direction.  And they've got a class system that's horrific.  They've got the extremely rich and the extremely poor.  Just like you, though.  Welcome to here.  That's what I mean.  It's like, so it doesn't really work that way.  I wanted to bring up, like, Chrysler was bailed out years ago under Lee Iacocca. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  What's the difference between then and now?  They were bailed out.  They actually wound up turning a profit and paying back the government with interest.  Like, why?  When was the last time you bought a Chrysler?  Well, I know.  I'm just saying, exactly.  Or a Dodge.  It's like, I'm just saying, like, why wasn't, why can't that model work today where you lend them money and they pay you back with interest?  I don't know a single thing about what I'm talking about so I can't answer you.  I know.  I don't know that either.  I actually don't know the answer to that. 
[02:09:30]  Yes, Jimmy?  Because the economy is so much worse now that the anticipation of getting their profits up in order to be able to pay back is definitely not good.  I don't know.  It was pretty bad back then.  Just made that up.  Was hoping it sounded right.  Yeah.  Also, GM is down to literally what it was in the 40s.  Yeah.  I mean, that's crazy.  Fantastic, isn't it?  I'm excited for it.  The new General Motors car.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Tour of America.  See the USA in your Chevrolet.  It's music marathon time, so we've got to get out of here.  We're going to fly windows. 
[02:10:00]  We're going over to Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Louie's going to be joining us over there.  Hydromatic transmission.  And if you're not going to join us, you have yourselves a fine, fine day.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Is this us?  Yeah, it's us.  Fucking Louie.  I could listen to you all day, Louie.  Louie C.K. made the walk over to Sirius XM Satellite Radio as we continue with the program. 
[02:10:30]  Talking about wear and tear injuries and whatever.  Maybe it was just a good conversation for four instead of a million.  Sometimes we do that.  Oh, let's do that again.  It doesn't have the same feel.  Nah.  Everyone feels uncomfortable.  It was just conversation.  Yeah, you're asking me to sign you.  Sure.  Yeah.  Who's Susan?  Some fan has everybody signing something for Susan on a piece of paper.  We're like, what is she going to do with that?  Yeah, what is that?  I can understand a picture or something. 
[02:11:00]  It looks a little nice.  Scroll it up and cram it in her.  Just a piece of paper with all the photographs on it.  Nice.  When I was in Bonnaroo, Jim, you and I were in Bonnaroo.  Bonnaroo.  And in Bonnaroo, there's always these hippie girls.  Yeah, man.  Nice, right?  The attire, common attire is a bikini top and cut off shorts.  Uh-huh.  And they're just laying in the middle of the grass, like 19-year-old girls, just stoned and  usually passed out with their legs spread open. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  And they're bush showing through their shorts.  How about that?  But I'm a father and I look at that and I'm like, fucking irresponsible cunt.  What are you doing?  Like, this country has got two wars in an economy.  You know, splash some water on your face, go back to school.  But every time I saw a girl like that, I wanted to write a little note that says, like, roll  up a note and put it in her vagina.  She pulls it out and says, this could have been a penis, you idiot.  I could have raped you, you wouldn't have woken up, you moron. 
[02:12:00]  You love being a father, but does it bother you to have daughters?  Not in the same way it does most guys.  I mean, I feel a more heavy responsibility to raise them well.  Right, you want to make sure you really do a good job.  Yeah.  Well, the running gag is always, you know, that's why she's got the daddy issues, that's  why she's up on the pole.  Yeah.  Well, I don't look at it that way.  Like, to me, that's what every guy, a lot of fathers think that failure means  that she ever touched a penis.  Yeah.  And she's a whore, and, you know, so they run, you know, any child or person in the 
[02:12:30]  world is going to run to sex.  It's just an instinct.  It's how you survive.  So if you get between a child and sex, they're going to find an end run around you through  shame and disgrace.  The quickest line from a person to sex is, you know, happiness and pride and joy and,  you know, and if you get in between that, you're going to make them take that end run. 
[02:13:00]  Go to shame and disgust and self-hate and Jimmy getting shit on.  What happens as a stripper is my failure as a father.  You're a success.  Even though it's bringing in a nice coin right now, even though it's paying for my retirement.  Yes.  Do you fast?  So I don't have this thing of, like, you know, I mean, a lot of fathers have that thing  of, like, I don't want her ever, you know, I knew a guy who didn't buy, he bought his  daughter a BMW because he didn't want her, he wanted her to have a nicer car than the 
[02:13:30]  guys in her school.  Oh, I see what he's going for.  Yeah, because he just doesn't want him because he's got this fantasy.  I'm not going to be a piece of shit.  But now the dude is driving the nice car.  He's driving her nice car while she's blowing him.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to say.  You just made it even easier for the guy.  Yeah, exactly.  So, but the way I look at it is if you, no, I mean, and also you're, you're, you're  doing the opposite.  You're making the girl have a high threshold of what she needs. 
[02:14:00]  She's going to need a guy with a BMW.  If you raise a girl with some confidence and some, you know, and you give her some bedrock,  you know, do you send her out of the world like she's feeling like she can do whatever  she wants and give her some sense of...  She's still going to get her face and ass fucks?  Yes, she is.  She is, Jimmy.  She's going to, but she's going to do it on her terms.  She's going to grab that dick by the base and go, I want to suck this right now.  That should be your goal as a father.  That your daughter only sucks a dick that she thinks is delicious.  And she sees the smelly, shriveled dick of a rich guy like you and says, I could take 
[02:14:30]  it or leave it.  I got, I got my own, I've set myself up.  Yeah.  I know I can get myself a job and take care of myself.  I'm only going to viciously suck dicks that I want to.  I'm only going to let guys who are quality guys fuck me hard in the ass while pulling  my hair and choking me.  What's your worst fear of having daughters, though, as they get older?  Yo, man, I'm a fan of your shit.  Your daughter's my girl. 
[02:15:00]  Yes.  My biggest fear, just that there's like, you know, nuclear apocalypse and they're just  on a pile of debris.  Ah, just lost in the sauce.  I get, just, no, I have horrible fears as a father.  Horrible.  I mean, I'm plaguing.  Not the horrific stuff.  I'm just saying, like.  Well, those are the ones you have.  Yeah.  Those are the ones you have is there's horrible things that can happen to them in this world.  I can't believe that. 
[02:15:30]  But you better not see the movie Taken.  Yeah, you know, I would never.  That kind of shit is just so manipulative to me.  Really?  It's just so easy, it's easy button to push with a parent.  But I, to me, if the kid is, if, you know, the idea that my kids are going to go to school  by themselves, even, that I'm going to open the door and say, see you later, have a good  walk to school.  I, that to me, it's unconscionable, unconscionable.  I don't see that day.  I don't, I can't live it in my head.  Wow, that's fucked up.  A day that they leave without.  And I did it every day from second grade. 
[02:16:00]  I used to walk to school alone.  Walk to school alone, just like, hey, I'm going out.  You hop on your bicycle and just fucking tear out somewhere.  And you wouldn't even come home for hours.  And then you come home and your mom's just like, oh, yeah, bad.  Like, we weren't even thinking about where you were or anything.  But I think you're lucky because nowadays everyone has a cell phone.  Like, you know, when we grew up, you just were out that front door on your own until  you came back.  Now you can at least, you know, check on them a little bit.  I guess so.  I don't know.  Maybe they don't want that, though.  So you got to figure out how that's, that's kind of cool without being overbearing, I guess. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  And I think, I don't know.  I think the whole cell phone thing of people being always accessible, it's all just very  weird.  I don't know how to be a parent in that environment.  I don't know how to be one without it.  I wasn't a parent in the 70s.  Sure, no.  But I was a kid in the 70s, so I had the relationship that way.  A lot of freedom.  I don't know how this shit's going to work out as a kid.  I am scared of it.  Tim from Columbus.  What's Louie's biggest fear as his daughters grow older?  One word.  Anthony.  No. 
[02:17:00]  Jesus.  My daughters grow up, and again, they have a whole life that they can sustain on their  own, and they meet a guy like Anthony, and they find it might be fun to roll in the hay  with that pig.  I think that I hope they get what they want out of this situation.  Wow.  Nice.  His rich, skinny fingers.  His little bizarre mustache up against their cooch.  Yes.  Exactly.  Leaving the house alone, though.  Wow.  Yeah, that's what scares me. 
[02:17:30]  But then I don't think about them in the other term.  They're going to be grown.  They're going to be adults.  It's no longer going to be any of my business what they do with that.  Right, right.  Wow.  But until then, it's got to be just a nightmare.  The only thing that I think about, yeah, is just them, yeah, I worry about that, and  I think about it sometimes irrationally.  You can't help it.  I mean, about them getting hurt or something.  Too much fucking turmoil.  It's a dangerous world.  Too much worry.  Too much fucking this.  I don't even know how or why you have kids.  I don't know.  Not you personally.  I'm talking to everybody in the world, plus you. 
[02:18:00]  No, it's a lot of fear.  It's like, why the fuck, you know?  And then your whole life is like, ah, now I've got to worry about it.  I'd rather just worry about me.  Like, and make sure I fucking make it through life.  It's a lot easier just to worry about yourself.  Yeah.  Now that, you know.  Well, you know what?  Now that I'm married, it's like, holy shit, I've got to, like, this is weird.  I actually really have to worry about someone now.  Not the fake worry, like, oh, that sucks, but then you move on with your life.  It's like, wow, I really have more worry in my life.  Well, and in a way, though, it's like.  And then you had kids to that.  That's crazy. 
[02:18:30]  Wow.  When you have kids, too, that kind of does a give and take, though, because I don't worry about  myself anymore.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  I don't care about what happens to me.  It's not important.  Only in terms of them.  Like, every time I have thoughts of suicide, don't worry, I'm fine.  But every time it happens to everybody, I go, oh, I'd like to just fucking cash out  right now.  I don't need this anymore.  But my first thought is I can't do it.  I got the kids.  I can't do it.  So I don't think in terms of my own happiness anymore.  I just think about their happiness.  Like, there's some parents, and I think it is actually good that my only worry is the 
[02:19:00]  ghoulish fears of, like, the random things that could happen.  Yeah.  Because I don't.  Some parents are like, like, they answer that question, what's your biggest fear?  That they'll forget who I am and not love me when I'm, fuck you, you know?  Fuck you.  Give us a shit.  Most parents are very narcissistic about their, that they'll know that I love them.  Oh, please.  Like in The Wrestler, which I really love, but when he says to his daughter, I just don't  want you to hate me.  Fuck you.  She's a, let her hate you.  If that's going to make her healthy, who gives a shit? 
[02:19:30]  Right.  It's not about you.  Stop with the guilt.  Yeah, you fucked somebody and had a child.  Right.  Now your responsibility has shifted to them.  Yeah.  You don't longer have a right to be selfish.  Oh, wow.  That was a good movie.  Did you see The Wrestler?  Yeah.  Yeah, I liked it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was good.  Speaking of movies, we got Polo out there.  Oh, that's right.  He's going to do a movie.  He's a Rana Fez guy, though.  He is a Rana Fez guy.  Are we acknowledging that it's a Rana Fez guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, obviously.  How'd this come about?  Well, because he has a motion picture. 
[02:20:00]  But wouldn't he just go on Rana Fez and promote his motion picture?  I believe he is doing that, too.  But see, I went on to Rana Fez.  Yeah.  And I started talking about Polo and his film.  Yeah.  And I had, you know, I guess a review of it.  Did you see the film?  Uh, some of it.  Okay.  I've not seen it.  All right.  I saw some of it.  Okay.  I heard you.  Um, and, um, you did.  Yeah, I heard you.  All right.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:20:30]  And, uh, so it got to the point where, you know, we had seen it.  Um, Sam has seen it, I believe, some of it.  Sam, you like the movie?  Sam, you saw it?  Let's see what Sam thinks of this movie.  Louis is a filmmaker.  He could appreciate a good film.  Yes.  Sam?  I was able to see the whole film last night.  It was terrifying.  It's a horror movie.  Oh, terrifying.  Terrifying.  Oh, gotcha.  Terrifying.  Fying.  Gotcha.  Yes.  It was long at parts, but... 
[02:21:00]  Long in parts, huh?  Yeah.  One part would be longer than another part.  It was.  The first hour was a lot longer than the second ten minutes.  I, um, I assumed that it was going to be one of those so bad that it's good movies, especially  since most of the cast, uh, I know.  Oh, really?  You've seen them walking around these very hallways and, um, you know.  That must be amazing.  You just know them.  Not as actors, but as just interns and people and fucking friends of the show and fat little 
[02:21:30]  English people that sell fucking t-shirts.  With tiny heads.  Little heads and no brains.  Stalkers.  Uh, yeah.  Stalkers.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, so I figured, yeah, at least I, I'm in on that.  It'll kind of be funny.  It didn't catch me like that.  He's right there, listen.  Yeah.  I, I didn't get it.  I didn't get the point.  Oh, boy.  You may want to. 
[02:22:00]  I, I didn't, um, I, I thought it was horrible.  Well, should we, dude, I want, I, I don't know.  I think we asked him a question.  Oh, sure.  Come on in, Paul.  This is Paul.  Come on in there, Paul O.  The, uh, the writer, director, star of.  The Orson Welles of Gap.  Yes.  The Gap.  Of Gap.  The movie's called Gap.  Wait, I want to start by saying, Paul O.  Now, it's been obviously many years.  I said, they replaced the G with a C-R and you might have a movie. 
[02:22:30]  Paul, Paul O.  It's a spelling joke.  Yeah, we like that.  Yeah.  It's been many years.  It's been many years ago in my head.  Gap.  Gap.  Gap.  Gap.  Gap.  Oh, crap.  Just to bring everyone up to speed, the last time you were on our show, what was it?  Was it the Sandy Kane kissing of the, uh, Twato?  What happened, yeah, what happened is over the years we've had encounters with the Sucky  Bed event and then, of course, the Enema show and the Twato show, various things over  the year, but I've always respected the, uh, fourth wall, the imaginary fourth wall between  Ron and Fez and Hopi and Anthony.  I, I just figured there was one. 
[02:23:00]  I don't know if there is one or not.  That there, uh, that there, uh, I don't think that's a good use of fourth wall.  The tween shall never meet.  I, I, I don't think, I think it's a terrible use of fourth wall.  Well, it's maybe the mind thing that I'm thinking.  No, that doesn't matter.  Is that like, you mean.  Fourth wall is where you're watching the thing and you imagine there's three walls to the,  uh, to the show and that the fourth wall is the audience.  It's torn down.  So some sort of, uh, you know, some sort of a barrier between Ron and Fez and this show  would not be any kind of a fourth wall.  No.  That would be one wall. 
[02:23:30]  It would be a fourth distinct.  Well, unless they were the audience.  No.  If Ron and Fez were the audience, then the fourth wall would be Ron and Fez.  It could be the fourth wall.  In any case, I've been with.  You saw a separate kind of thing.  I thought I should honor something.  I don't know what I would call it.  Well, you know what it was.  That's what, well, we would, we wouldn't have you on to do your, you know, let's have  Paulo do movie reviews or things like that because that's your Ron and Fez guy.  Right.  But since you put out.  Yeah, and there's a fourth wall between the two shows.  And there's a fourth wall and there's no door.  That's what I thought.  So you got to go through the ductwork.  Maybe it's just a bay window or something. 
[02:24:00]  That's what I'm thinking.  So, but in any case, I was doing Ron and Fez since the 90s.  Yeah, just keep trotting ahead with this.  As a movie reviewer.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  And so people expect me to know movies in and out and then they have an expectation that  this should be like Citizen Kane, Gap.  Well, no.  Why would they expect that as a movie reviewer?  Why would anyone expect a movie reviewer to make anything that is like Citizen Kane?  Well, I think they would expect that I would have a full knowledge of movies and a full  understanding of what a movie should be. 
[02:24:30]  Not really.  No.  Oh.  Well, how long did it take you to make the movie?  Okay.  First of all, this was an experimental movie and it took three days to make.  Experimental movie.  Three days.  Louie's a filmmaker.  Three days?  Yes.  What do you think of a movie that only took three days?  It would be a tenth of the amount of time it usually takes.  And how long is the movie?  It's an hour and 23 minutes.  So it's not like it's a short, like a five-minute short that you throw together.  We cut it down for three hours.  What?  So there's three hours.  Shot an hour a day and then edited it out, half of it. 
[02:25:00]  They edited it out Tuesday.  Yeah.  Hey, is there a director's cut that's going to ever be available?  Well, here's the problem.  There's actually, before we start promoting this movie, I have to honor the Ron and Fez,  Opie, and Anthony community.  So because essentially this movie should only be released with no knowledge of what this  is.  So we put out the director's cut collector's edition now.  Well, don't worry.  If you see it, you won't know what it is either.  And then we're going to put out the basic edition later.  Do you want to market this to the movie theaters?  No. 
[02:25:30]  I don't think we can because I have no money.  But, you know, I would...  This is just something.  He burns you a copy on his map.  No, we have...  And he writes the name of it in Sharpie on the actual disc.  All right.  First thing I'd like to say is please go to gapthemovie.com because my life is completely  fucked up.  It's horribly fucked.  So we need you to buy this.  No, I heard you on Ron and Fez recently.  It sounds like you're getting your life together.  You got a new girl.  Is the new girl thing over already?  No, that's actually the one good thing in my life.  Because you married...  I think I was at one of your weddings. 
[02:26:00]  And you married somebody who left you to go to England to be with somebody else, right?  Lovely girl, Mellie.  Yeah, Mellie.  Right, sure.  But she was obsessed with this guy who was in prison for years.  So why would you marry someone like that?  Because I thought we worked through it.  It takes three days to shoot a movie.  You can't work through it.  Apparently not.  Well, he got out of prison.  How long did it take for her?  Oh, he got out.  And then he says, I need you.  I'm drinking myself to death.  So I bought her a ticket over there.  She was going to help him out.  Holy shit. 
[02:26:30]  You bought her a ticket?  You didn't think she'd fuck him or anything, right?  Anybody whose name is Mellie.  We kind of talked that through.  We worked it out.  I thought we worked it out.  What did she say?  Because she wouldn't fuck it.  She said, no, no way.  I'm going to help him.  That has to be the worst name I ever heard, Mellie.  Mellie.  Mellie.  It's just even if you're trying to be nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You go, hey, who's on the phone?  It's Smellie.  It's going to be Smellie.  It's Smellie.  Even if you're not trying to call her Smellie.  Actually.  She wasn't going to fuck him.  She was definitely fucking you, though.  Oh, and that's not it.  Wait, Paul, hold on. 
[02:27:00]  How long did you, as an open-ended ticket, or how long were you sending her for?  I said two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  So she didn't need to return a ticket, apparently.  Oh, boy.  Was he someone she had fucked before?  No.  They had this thing.  Oh, God.  It's so freaking complicated.  I can't even go into it.  It's platonic.  It's platonic.  You know, it was extremely obsessive love, and there was a lot of spooning involved.  Hold on.  Why is it spooning?  Why did she get obsessed with the prison guy to begin with?  Did she know him ahead of time?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was a filmmaker in England. 
[02:27:30]  A filmmaker.  A filmmaker.  What kind of films?  I'm a filmmaker.  It's not films.  No.  No.  And he actually worked with kids.  Oh, wow.  Filmmaker.  I don't know why he was working with kids.  August Productions.  No.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Oh, that's...  And whatever happened to put him in prison, I believe it was completely innocent, in all  honest...  Gagan Pictures.  Oh, no.  What did they say?  Yeah, what did they say?  It was an offense of that nature.  Of pedo shit?  No, but it was not.  There was no physical contact at any point. 
[02:28:00]  He jerked off in front of them, right?  No, no.  He was helping, but you...  He shit their mouths while they jerked themselves off.  Yeah, what was the charge?  Wait, he spent time in prison.  It's similar to fraternizing.  He made cummy on a cracker in the baby.  It would be as similar to fraternizing.  He was helping.  He was helping to film...  He was helping a person who was abused.  ...who were inappropriately being filmed.  He was holding the boom while somebody fucking kissed his face.  Boom, Alfred.  Boom, Alfred.  There was no...  Boom with a cock.  Wait, wait, wait.  I swear to God.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm not trying to... 
[02:28:30]  He would meet them at restaurants.  Hold on.  What?  He would meet them at restaurants to counsel because they were being abused at home.  Sure.  And that's against the rules when you are working with kids, and so that's what he went to jail  for.  So how long did he go to jail for?  So he's obviously...  Eight months.  Because he was fucking them.  He's obviously a kid toucher.  Why can't you admit that?  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  I mean, they got him on something.  So the kid goes, I want to...  My dad's touching me.  I don't know how to get through this.  And he goes, why don't you meet me at the Olive Garden time?  Right.  Yeah.  Let's talk about it there.  Won't that be easier?  Yeah.  It's a table you can jack me off under. 
[02:29:00]  Let's get back to Captain...  No, no, no, no, no.  What's wrong with you that you would allow your wife to go to England to be with this  dude?  Far more interesting.  I'm too nice.  I'm too fucking nice.  I'm a fucking idiot.  What do you want from this?  Wait, your wife wanted to go chit-chat with a pedophile she had spooned with, and you  bought her a plane ticket.  Yeah.  I'm an idiot.  And you wonder...  She's in the movie anyway.  My ex-wife is in the movie.  That's one of Dawn's also.  One of Dawn's failure.  Marriages.  Oh, great.  We had a great relationship, but there was always this daughter.  My sister actually did the ceremony. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, Paulo and Mellie.  Oh, wow.  She is...  Do you miss Mellie?  I do.  I love her, and I love this person I'm with, so I'm very happy with that.  Smellie.  Would you take Smellie back?  Smellie.  This is the point.  I have moved on, and I do know she's fucked up.  Oh, Mellie?  Yeah, Mellie.  So there's no point.  I have a much better person now, much...  For now.  A widow woman.  You're going to mess that up.  Yeah.  It was perfect.  Perfect for you.  Did you kill your wife, or how did I heat it up?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:30:00]  Now, Gail, we know the...  I want to know some answers today.  The late Gail O.  Are you passionate about that?  She's in the movie as well.  She is in the movie.  It was a little...  He has a wife who dies, too?  Yeah.  Did you drive her to kill herself?  She had a lot of mental problems.  What?  I'm crazy.  She had a lot of mental problems.  She was on a lot of medication.  Did she kill herself, really?  And Arana Fez would have her on the air every so often, and she just would be manic.  Yeah.  Manic.  She would be...  Screaming and yelling and stuff.  Some days, she would be okay. 
[02:30:30]  Other days, she's screaming and yelling, and Polo's in the background, just, you know, taking  all kinds of abuse.  I can't do movie reviews.  And doing movie reviews.  And then to see her in the movie was a little distressing.  And it had nothing to...  It was like the Bela Lugosi scene in fucking...  In Plan 9 from Outer Space.  Did she die during the filming?  When he's in front of the house and just kind of...  Right.  Did she die during the filming?  The three-day filming?  I was with her for...  She came.  And as a matter of fact, we segregated her in another hotel when we were doing the film. 
[02:31:00]  All right, but you're fast-forwarding.  I need answers.  No, this was much later.  How did she kill herself?  I've known this guy for four minutes.  I want to kill myself.  I'm going to guess he had something to do with it.  But, Polo, how did she kill herself?  I don't know.  She had had an accident where she leaped off a ladder.  Leaped?  That's not an accident.  Not Paul.  Leap.  There's no accident involved if you're leaping.  Well, I had put the drugs on the top rung of some...  No, I'm just kidding.  And I swear to God... 
[02:31:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  There's no kidding here.  I didn't ask for these.  I swear to God, she...  Oh, as long as you got them.  I was...  I mean, I didn't want them, really.  Donuts are pretty good, right?  Donuts, that's weird.  I never would have asked for these.  Thanks, Ken.  As long as I don't want to be rude.  Those donuts look so great.  What are you doing?  I want a donut so bad.  He's got a rod.  Donuts and sushi is a great combination.  Oh, God.  That's not, Lou.  That's wonderful.  No, it isn't, though, is it? 
[02:32:00]  Because they have very contrasting tastes.  Oh, you hole.  All right, listen, listen.  This story is too good, so let's focus back here.  All right.  Just one side.  Jell-O died.  So you put her drugs, her medication, or these were illegals?  No, they're all legal.  Well, they're all legal because they all came from pharmacies.  But she was over-medicating herself?  Oh, yeah.  All right, so you put the drugs up on the top rung of a ladder?  And where was this ladder?  Let's say about...  Oh, she used a ladder.  Yeah, she used a ladder.  All right, where were the drugs?  I'm sorry. 
[02:32:30]  They're way on top of, like, a bookshelf that may be nine feet high.  What kind of drugs were there?  How tall is your house?  You mean they put bookcases?  Yeah, it was tall.  Fucking bookcases are there.  I was a double stacker.  How did she know they were there?  Because you told her?  Or she was searching until she found them?  No, she's searching.  She's crazed.  And she needs the drugs.  Yeah.  And I decided at that point she doesn't need the drugs.  You know, she needs to stop.  So she gets up on the ladder, and I find her.  I went to the store.  I came back.  I find her on the floor. 
[02:33:00]  She broke her shoulder.  So she had to go to the hospital and everything else.  Then, later, the screws...  She died of a broken shoulder?  No.  In a chance.  She broke it on a train.  In a chance.  Right, right.  She thought the screw would hurt.  There was a screw in the shoulder that was starting to poke out.  Oh, boy.  So it needed to be redone.  Yeah.  Wow, you just bend it over with a hammer.  That's what I told her.  I used to do it over the tip.  So when she went in, the day she came out of the hospital for the one-day surgery for 
[02:33:30]  that, they gave her more drugs.  Oh, boy.  And all extra drugs that night.  So she had too much drug.  It was a drug overdose.  It was a drug overdose.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'll be entirely honest with you.  Is that...  What happened?  Yeah.  Her crazy life.  I mean, I spent 30 years with this woman.  Crazy.  Especially the last few years, because she had all these medications. 
[02:34:00]  The best...  She really got to a point of being close to God and then...  Boring.  A lot closer after the OD.  Yeah.  All right.  And anyway, she's in GapTheMovie.com.  So who wants to see a dead girl in your movie?  That was a little...  Creepy.  Like, creepy.  Yeah.  I just had integrity after it.  Exactly.  And the thing is, her part made no sense.  Not that I'm saying that most of the movie made sense.  I'm just saying that that part especially... 
[02:34:30]  And Dave screaming, too.  Dave from the Runa Fez show, screaming.  I didn't understand what that was all about.  All right.  Let me just very briefly explain the movie.  Number one, it is meant to go for the horror audience, which is, of course, this crazy  fucked up shit.  The more crazy fucked up it is, that better.  Right, right.  It's also...  So like a slasher movie kind of thing?  It is also intended for the arthouse audience, which also is into crazy fucked up.  You know, if you're going to talk John Locke Goddard...  Arthouse, shithouse.  No, arthouse, okay. 
[02:35:00]  So it's kind of a message movie as well.  So all of these...  See, that's what I was missing, was the message.  Yes.  And it is...  The message is this movie is horror.  So it is what it is.  It is a specific thing that was done as an experiment.  And it is about a video diary of a madman.  And of course, part of the problem is a lot of people seem to think, I'm a little bit  of a fucking lunatic as well.  And I don't think so.  Well, come on.  They do certainly say that.  So I've been listening to the Gap explanation for how many years, and a half, something 
[02:35:30]  like that.  I still have no effing idea what this movie is about.  Saw it, or most of it anyway, and I have no idea what it's about.  All I see in scene 15 is Paolo with some type of a knife, some victim poorly tied up in  the background, very loosely tied up in the background, trying not to laugh as they're 
[02:36:00]  squirming and not really trying, or the fear isn't really getting there.  And then a bloodless murder scene for a horror movie.  Anthony, maybe he didn't tie them up tightly because the fear, the intimidation of who he  was, was keeping them there, and that's part of the mistake of him as a killer.  Or maybe he didn't tie them tightly because it made them uncomfortable.  They weren't actors, they were just friends of his.  Well, the fear and intimidation would have been a good thing to keep the viewer there, 
[02:36:30]  because it didn't work for me.  All right, first of all, to defend the movie, I honestly believe that, you know, there has  been an, it's a specific type of movie that you haven't seen before, and it kind of taps  into that audience, hopefully, down the road, once I finish marketing to my core audience,  which is, of course, Rod Fez, Opie, and Anthony.  I want it to be four people.  You don't have to put Opie and Anthony in there.  Okay.  No problem.  Rod Fez and Pedophile.  That's your audience.  Pedophile, fucking wife stealers.  You know, the Blair Witch Project is obviously a lot of shaky cabin things. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, right.  Okay, okay.  So you're kind of, we're going for some kind of a, this is not professional, professionally  shot.  It's supposed to be some lunatic setting up a tripod with a camera before he kills people.  Right.  Why don't you just cut your losses and just not promote this movie and make another one?  Well, first of all, here's the problem, as apparently people know my life, you know, 
[02:37:30]  a lot of problems.  You know, my life's a movie.  So I have $145,000 in debt and then I have two houses I can't unload.  So I'm not able to make another movie until I, besides I have.  How much did that cost?  Oh, not a lot.  How much?  How much?  Technically $10,000.  Why so much?  Well, because I had to go to New York and we had to get people together and get hotels  and stuff because, you know, I had to sort of gather people. 
[02:38:00]  So your logistics cost more than the actual taping.  Yeah, exactly.  The editing was a little bit, but the editing was a little bit, what, you actually had an  editor?  Yeah, I actually had an editor.  Who was the editor you hired?  The governor of New York?  This fucking thing goes on forever.  I cut it down for three hours.  From three hours.  The scene with No Filter Paul.  Yes.  Who's a genius.  He genius does great work.  Genius.  I'm using that word again.  I want to see that. 
[02:38:30]  He, that scene goes on and on and on to the, it's maddening.  And I don't mean in a good way.  It's not like I was, I was saying, I don't mean like watching this and going, holy shit,  this is great.  I was like, holy shit, they're still fucking doing this.  I left, usually when I'm watching a movie I haven't seen before and I have to go take  a piss, grab a beer, whatever, I pause it.  Sure.  I didn't pause this.  I just went.  I took a piss.  I grabbed a beer.  I washed my car.  Whatever. 
[02:39:00]  I come back.  Fucking No Filter Paul is still in the chair, loosely tied, with no shirt on.  Everybody's in their underwear.  That's true.  Yeah, everyone's in their underwear.  And there's some nudity as well, because, you know, they say the foreign markets, you  need the nudity.  Foreign markets?  What are you looking for foreign?  Jersey?  Over here, we like clothes.  It's Japanese.  I need.  Japanese.  The Japanese.  The Japs, please.  Gapthemovie.com.  Get on there.  I actually have a.  Just change the G to a J then.  I don't think it's about them. 
[02:39:30]  Well, he go over fourth wall.  He went over fourth wall.  I don't like it.  Fourth wall.  No, you can never go over fourth wall.  Between a Roy Fizzer or the Anthony.  It's a fourth wall.  Hey, rough the gap.  Are you familiar with a movie called Peeping Tom?  Yes, of course.  Oh.  Well, Louie might be on to something.  Louie thinks that your movie sounds very much like Peeping Tom.  It is.  It's the same movie.  It's a famous British director who did a lot of very classy.  Who fucked a wife of some guy and shipped her over. 
[02:40:00]  That's right.  Oh.  He was in prison.  He did a famous ballet movie called The Red Shoes, but he did the Peeping Tom.  Real famous.  Oh.  No clue.  I also just, I want to touch on something.  The way it was shot and edited.  Yes.  Do you or the editor or anybody, who was in charge of the aspect ratio of the movie?  All right, there were, the whole point is to be as experimental as possible.  Right.  I understand. 
[02:40:30]  So you change aspect ratios for time.  I understand.  So it would go from widescreen.  Here's the thing.  With experimental film, the idea is that you have an idea that you're burning to do as a  filmmaker.  Nobody's really done it before, but you're willing to try it as an experiment to see if  it'll work.  The thing isn't to go, I want to make an experimental movie.  So what kinds of things are experimental?  You're supposed to start with an idea of a movie, that this is a movie I really want  to make.  I think this would be cool.  And even though it hasn't been done, I'm willing to do the experiment.  You're starting with, I want to do something weird. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  How about changing the aspect ratio that will hurt people's eyes?  That will just, like, the thing is, I'm thinking, if you were going to go widescreen,  right, then you shoot the whole thing widescreen.  And then, in editing, you make it look like the regular old style TV.  What ratio is that?  Three, four?  Yeah.  Something like that.  Going that.  That gets it to fractions.  Right.  What?  It gets it to fractions.  Well, whatever it is.  You could have laid the whole thing out so that my television wouldn't snap back and 
[02:41:30]  forth.  It was stretching and snapping.  Like, your TV knows.  Your TV, your DVD players these days, it knows when to do certain things to certain aspect  ratios.  So, if you would have just kept it all widescreen and then made it look, it wouldn't have been.  It was so distracting.  Every time it switched, my TV went click, click, and then numbers came up on the side,  a code, the fucking stretch.  It said wide. 
[02:42:00]  It went, like, my TV was freaking out.  My TV hated your movie.  It's, you're, it's, the movie is actually supposed to generate hate in every possible  way.  Oh, right.  It's supposed to force people, confront people, push people to the edge in a lot of ways.  In a different way, I think, was the intent.  It forces people to turn off their TV.  Well, I figured every way I could do it, of course.  It forces people to rent Peeping Tom, which is the one you stole it from, which is better.  I didn't steal.  See, this was better.  We all steal. 
[02:42:30]  See, what you're saying is.  Wait, I didn't steal.  Yeah, we all steal.  You and the thieves all steal, yeah.  Hey, Paul, what I'm saying is there's a difference between, let's see, you're watching a movie  about a bank robbery.  Right.  And you're, like, immersed in it and going, holy shit, I'm afraid, I'm concerned for these  characters.  There's a bank robbery going on.  And then actually being involved in a bank robbery.  Right.  You're going to feel an emotion.  Right.  Like you said, to bring out hatred, it's supposed to.  But it's the wrong thing. 
[02:43:00]  In the movie version, it's great if you could bring that out.  The physical act of watching it made me hate you.  Okay, well, at first of all.  It was not the movie.  It's essentially an anti-film.  It goes against all the film jargon and the film logistics that you're used to.  So, you see, in a way, that's...  The groaning you're hearing is Louis C.K., who knows a little bit about film, right?  A filmmaker.  No, we should do...  I like what you're saying.  Shut it, James.  I do. 
[02:43:30]  No, we should do, because Louis is here.  Jimmy is an insufferable prick.  Can we get the first scene of the movie and we can watch it, because I've never seen  any...  Get the first scene up there.  Would you mind if we broadcast the first scene of this movie?  Paul, hold on.  You really want to go to the North Coast?  Can I say something about Louis here?  No, we don't.  And Louis is a brilliant filmmaker.  Yes.  But...  He's a brilliant guy.  He's a brilliant filmmaker.  But...  Fantastic.  You're a genius.  There's an idea here that maybe you pushed that he didn't think of. 
[02:44:00]  And it's almost like he's trying to cut off your legs, because what if your idea is  all of a sudden better?  I am Bernie Michelle K.  Right.  But let me just say to Louis C.K.  It's killing me.  Let me just say to Louis C.K.  I went the wrong way with my career.  As I say, what this is intended for...  First of all, this has been developed on air for a year and a half, so everybody's aware  of it.  Not by anyone's choice, by the way.  I understand that.  That's understandable.  But here, it's really supposed to leap out of the shadows, and you don't know what the 
[02:44:30]  fuck this is.  It makes you want to leap from a ladder.  You know, when you find it and have no knowledge of it, then you'll be real and say, what the  fuck is this?  Polo, I can understand what you're saying about it, but it's not...  I understand the aspect ratio is a problem.  And I did have a camera problem, because I had two different cameramen, so there was a  problem.  All right, listen.  Two different cameramen.  Holy shit, Desi Arnaz.  Now you're getting a little crazy.  Listen, we've got to take a break. 
[02:45:00]  We've got Polo.  He's promoting, I guess, Gap.  Are you doing something crazy on Ron and Fez today?  I'm always available.  You said something about your last stunt.  Yeah, and we sent out a crazy...  It's your suicide.  ...some life coach guy sent out a crazy memo to you guys that I was going to be horrible.  What does the title mean?  The Gap.  Oh, it's actually, here's the message.  The divisions of society.  The generation gap was the core issue.  Right, yeah.  But, I mean, we're always divided from each other on every level. 
[02:45:30]  What does that have to do with some guy in his underwear killing another guy?  He's torturing people, sacrificing people, so we will love each other more.  So we'll learn.  It's like a lesson.  So you'll love each other more?  Yeah, it's like...  I think you guys are prejudging it.  I mean, it's honestly...  All right.  ...social message.  After the break...  Maybe I was too stoned when I watched it.  Maybe.  I don't know.  After the break...  After the break, we'll do the opening scene, because you've got a filmmaker in studio,  and you'll get an honest review, okay? 
[02:46:00]  Thank you.  I want to see some of this film.  And also, you've got to show off your horrendous tattoos sometime today.  Yeah.  Sometime today.  I'll be able to stay there.  Nice.  Yeah, let's talk about AshleyMadison.com for a second.  There's a service out there, Lou, for people that are unhappily married.  And instead of going through a divorce, because some people feel like, holy fuck, I can't afford a divorce,  so they stay married, and they're doing some of that fucking on the side.  Yeah, get divorced.  And AshleyMadison.com is there to help those people. 
[02:46:30]  Get divorced.  Just get divorced, right?  No.  I'm sorry if you're trying to make some money.  Too expensive.  Too expensive.  So, and let's say the marriage is fine, but you just not get any sex, but she's taking care of the house, the kids, whatever.  You just want to go out and fuck.  You know what?  I'm with Lou.  AshleyMadison.com.  What are you doing?  No, you get a, it's 100% discreet.  Totally.  It's discreet, so she's not going to find out.  Be a man.  You're going to hook up with some chick, and she's in the same boat.  What are you doing?  Maybe she's, maybe she's in a marriage, a loveless marriage. 
[02:47:00]  You're unhappy.  And then the two of you hook up.  Don't be a pussy.  Get a divorce and deal with what happens.  She's not touching her dick.  Fucking let her touch the street.  Everything's fine except the sex.  She's a perfect little, little woman at home.  Is she?  Then you need some sex on the side.  Louie makes a good point.  Just the fuck out of the thing.  Just leave your physical marriage.  Well, regardless, if you leave or not, I think you should go to AshleyMadison.com.  Look, if you can get laid by calling that place, do it. 
[02:47:30]  But if you're in a shitty marriage, get out of it.  AshleyMadison.com.  No, a lot of people don't want to.  They can't.  What?  Yes, they can.  You're a lot stronger than a lot of people, Louie.  Yes, we can.  You are a lot stronger than a lot of people.  I'm not strong.  Some people can't.  I'm not strong.  I'm saying this in retrospect.  I couldn't do it.  I'm exactly like these people.  Let me tell you, if I had used this service, I'd be married today, probably.  You know what?  Thank God I didn't hear this commercial before.  100% secure, completely anonymous, and free to join.  Go to AshleyMadison.com. 
[02:48:00]  It's absolutely free.  Join now.  What the hell?  Find your lovers here at AshleyMadison.com.  And we're back.  Louie C.K. in studio today, playing Caroline tomorrow night.  212-757-4100.  Those tickets are going to go real fast.  And, wow, boy, we're lucky.  Paulo in studio.  Oh, yeah.  Promoting gap on our show.  Yep.  I don't know what we did to Ron and Fez to deserve this. 
[02:48:30]  Well, it's the fourth wall.  Payback's going to be a bitch.  Huh?  The fourth wall is finally broken.  Yeah, that fourth wall he's still going with, Louie.  What is the incorrect use of fourth wall?  I was fucking wrong.  Sorry, I was corrected.  Thank you, Louie C.K.  Louie already explained that that just doesn't work.  Gapthemovie.com.  And I even got a promotional called Ron Fez.  If you go there, he'll send you the film, baby.  I need to sell him.  Some people are saying that they send money, you don't send the movie.  Oh, that was...  That's great.  That's great service.  That's busting balls.  You send money, we don't send the movie.  In this case, that is actually the proper thing. 
[02:49:00]  It's the easiest transaction you'll ever take part in.  There's some accusations out there, Paulo.  You're not sending out the movie.  Because that's what people do on those message boards.  They bust balls.  Why would anybody take the time to make a complaint that's totally unbased in fact?  Because there's a lot of hate things.  Obviously, you've been slow on the shipping.  Also, Paul, is it true that one of the backers of this movie was XM Satellite Radio?  What?  It's not true, because it was a $10,000 movie. 
[02:49:30]  If I could have gotten XM involved, we could have spent $20,000.  Really?  You think?  That's what I was.  Because Sam was just explaining to me that perhaps...  Sam, what do you know on this?  XM was involved.  I wasn't sure.  Yeah, Sam?  So I just threw it out there.  Oh, I don't know if XM was involved or not.  Oh, okay.  Allegations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Frankly, I would love for somebody to become involved.  Now, don't you have some kind of a Ponzi scheme going where, because I know people are involved  in this, you give them, they sell your DVD, and they almost work up in levels like Amway? 
[02:50:00]  Yes.  I'm not even kidding.  I've heard him, he's doing something like this.  It's a Ponzi scheme.  It's Bernie made shit.  All I've tried, I'm trying to get people in on the ground floor.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because this is a movement, hopefully, down the road, when people are not aware of what's  happening.  Because, you know, let's face it, there are people in Japan and stuff that don't really 
[02:50:30]  know what's going on.  So eventually...  That don't know what's going on?  I just don't know what...  Why do we have to face it?  Why do we have to face that?  Is that a hard truth?  And eventually...  That people in Japan don't know...  Let's face it, folks.  Let's really say what's really going on here to everyone's...  The elephant in the room.  Paul, explain...  Is that no one in Japan knows about this movie.  No one.  No one in Japan.  Look, I have a hard time saying it, personally, but let's face it.  People in Japan don't know about this yet.  Eventually, I may have to die first, but the movement will eventually take home. 
[02:51:00]  The whole movement.  Paul, Paul, just explain to me the business model of people selling your discs and getting  money back, and then there's, like, levels.  How does that work?  I have various people who love me and want to do things for me, and so I say, well, sure,  if you sell some of the movies, I'll give you a little extra.  A little extra.  Yeah.  So they then go out and sell online, and then they get a cut of the money. 
[02:51:30]  They get a cut.  Right now, I've got to see...  My life is fucked up, so I'm looking for all the help I can get.  I'm not...  I'm taking a blind eye to anything that's going on behind my back or on the side, but by all  means, I appreciate it.  I wish I was taking a blind eye to your movie and a deaf ear.  You take a long time to answer questions.  That's true.  Yeah, none of that made any sense.  I'm evasive.  What are you saying?  Anthony, what are you hearing?  You sell, like, the movie and then...  Yeah, I'm hearing, like, he's got some kind of...  Do you know anything about this, Sam? 
[02:52:00]  Why are we asking?  Because he can't...  Well, Sam knows a lot about this.  I don't have to investigate.  I fucking hate this guy.  You know the guy's right in front of you.  I hate you.  No, he doesn't say anything.  Some kind of scheme where he'll give you...  Right, it's one of those things, like, if you sell the movie, you get, like, $2 back.  Movies to sell?  Yeah.  But then if you sell 10, you get, like, three per...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So if you sell more movies, you make more money.  How many copies have been bought?  I have no...  I know nothing about this.  How many copies have been bought?  Twelve?  I need to...  That's a quick answer, Paul.  How many sold?  Okay, at this point, since we really haven't properly promoted, that's why I'm here today, 
[02:52:30]  we sold, like, 120.  That's not bad.  Who are those saps?  How much have popped?  120?  Right now, we have them at $17.99.  $17.99?  We're dropping the price $2 today with the Rock Faire.  Dark Knight?  Look, I'm a sole proprietor here.  I have big bills that I have to pay, and I'm just saying, I'm willing...  We can probably even work out a deal with Photoshop Mike, where people in the New York area can get a real deal.  Have you made your money back yet? 
[02:53:00]  No.  Of course not.  Let's look at the old...  Do the math.  120 times 18.  Uh, Louie, this is for you.  $1,200.  This is for you, Lou.  It ain't $10,000.  No, it ain't.  It's $21,60.  We're going to look at the first scene of...  $21,60.  ...of Gap.  That word is there?  It's...  The first word was there.  The second word is...  This is the playful font choice.  It is.  It is.  Playful font!  There's a lot of music going on.  Play school font.  Yeah, play school.  Yeah, it is the...  Wait, where's our audio? 
[02:53:30]  And then he changes to...  There is rock music.  That's actually the...  Wait, we need the rock music.  He writes Gap twice.  And that's the shaky Friends opening...  Yeah, the Friends opening font.  Friends opening font.  The music's got it.  These are all default choices on Final Cut Pro.  I'm a monster.  Oh, this is the movie?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  And that's me as a young, toe-headed child.  Now, I'm a monster.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:54:00]  War.  Life is a war.  We hate each other.  It's hopeless.  It'll never get any better.  I wish I could do something about it.  So I am.  This is an art film.  I want to do something that matters.  I'm watching your movie.  Have an impact.  For fuck's sake.  Stop.  We're in a theater, I agree.  I get it.  I get it.  Babe.  Did somebody change the channel, or is this still the movie?  It's still the movie.  I'm not really in favor of...  That's my late life.  That's the dead life. 
[02:54:30]  That doesn't make me necessarily a nice person, but it just means you don't have to give back  what they did to you.  Unfortunately, the life they chose.  Oh.  And it does lead to that.  It's hard to make a choice.  Make a choice about what?  Well, she made her.  Hit stop.  You couldn't wait for the truck to fucking pass by?  I wish there was a boy.  You couldn't fucking just cut.  There's a truck in the fucking...  Let's take that again.  This is a video. 
[02:55:00]  No.  No, that's not an anti-virus.  Have you examined it?  Yes, I have.  And I don't find any true evil in myself.  I find a lot of horrible mistakes.  I think you need to take it closer, though.  Is this a toll booth on the Jersey Turnpike you shot this in?  No.  No, I've made a lot of horrible mistakes, but they were never evil.  I think you need to take it closer.  She's good.  Well, if that's what she was saying, but I don't know.  She was good before she fell off the ladder with a shoulder infection. 
[02:55:30]  And she wears lots of wacky clothes over the years.  If it would save your soul, would you sacrifice your life?  Not anymore.  Did it save my soul or my body?  Your soul.  Yes.  Would you die?  Yes.  Okay.  I would.  All right.  That's all.  Okay.  She should have killed her suicide.  This is the first one I lived with forever and lived through tragedy after tragedy with  in what seemed like forever, but it had to end.  Cops in traffic court read into the record better than that. 
[02:56:00]  Her crazy hat.  A cop reading into the record what he saw you do on the highway when you were speeding  reads better than that.  She couldn't get James Earl Jones.  Wait, wait, wait.  She found the right balance of medication.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to pause this.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, you've got to pause her.  I want to know why, if this is some kind of a video diary of some fictitious thing, 
[02:56:30]  why did you put realism in there?  Like, you talk about her.  It's really her.  She really did do that.  She's dead now.  And you recite.  It's not part of a movie.  It's like the fucking director having his little home movie and a little comment at the  beginning of a movie.  They always say that you write what you know.  You didn't write what you know.  You put down.  It's a whole movie.  It's a whole movie.  Also, she talks like she talks like he does. 
[02:57:00]  Every day in the movie is just this rambling never sentences that literally don't begin.  Some people have sentences that don't end.  He has sentences that don't begin.  It just come in the middle.  One moment you're not listening to him, the other moment you are, you go, how did I get,  where am I, where am I?  It's a quasi-pseudo-documentary.  Oh, quasi-pseudo.  Yep, it is.  Throwing a few words together makes it a little better.  Quasi-pseudo-documentary.  Okay, now I'm looking at you and you're screaming at Pat.  Yeah, it's obviously something's going on. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, yeah, now something's going on.  Okay, let's listen.  I'm always trying to clarify my thoughts, make sure I'm right, make sure I'm not making mistakes.  I mean, there are so many gaps.  Gaps.  Gaps.  Gaps.  Gaps.  Now, look at this in the context.  I want to start using music in this presentation.  We're not going to use this.  So dead, so arrogant, distasteful, contemptuous, with no heart.  No wonder the record industry is being destroyed.  If they even call it the record industry anymore, it's not something like that would make me mad. 
[02:58:00]  Ooh, commentary.  Can you stop for a second?  So what's happening there is he's going to start putting some score, some music in it.  So he tells the audience, I'm going to play some music now during this movie.  It'll be like you're watching Jaws and you hear, hey, here comes a shark, listen to this piece of music.  That makes it sound scary.  Do these go together well to you folks?  Write me a letter and let me know.  Why did you do that? 
[02:58:30]  Because exactly.  He is commenting on the fact that he's putting in music that he hates.  You know, this modern, you know, type of...  Record industry.  Give me a break.  So he's commenting on the destruction of society.  God, record industry.  Why do they call it that anymore?  They don't.  You're the only one calling it that.  It's the music industry.  It's the guy who's obsessed with the Generation Gap.  Is he?  Oh, it's a character.  I'm sorry.  It's a character.  It's a character.  So exactly.  And he's obsessed with the records.  Records don't exist anymore.  I know.  It's crazy. 
[02:59:00]  It's just insane, right?  It's just...  Yeah.  Wow.  I keep playing it with that.  All right.  Let's see.  ...sale for two millions.  It's being a high point.  That's because civilization is dying.  It's killing music.  You know, civilization.  Civilization.  Things can't go on like this.  So I'm just going to place the music in.  Everybody's coming.  Can't hear you.  Can't hear you.  Can't understand what I'm saying.  That requires repeated viewings. 
[02:59:30]  You see, this is the film.  It requires repeated throwing into the garbage and never watching it once.  And the deeper you get in, you can't...  It requires repeated attention to the sound mix.  Let's hear that again.  Make sure we can hear what he's saying.  Because otherwise, why are you saying it if you're not going to turn it up?  Oh, my God.  Go, Paul.  For that first time, you listen to me.  You say, I've got to see.  I didn't hear.  I've got to hear.  No, you're just saying, why the fuck can't I hear what he's saying? 
[03:00:00]  No, but you're saying that it makes people intrigued.  Do they want to come back and hear what they're saying?  I don't even disagree.  I agree.  I don't disagree at all.  Should we go a little more?  All right.  A little more.  Let's go.  Let's go.  The camera's really rocking back and forth.  It's doing it on purpose.  It's doing it on purpose.  There was some leaves in the tree.  Well, the music getting louder is better.  That's good.  Now I can't hear me. 
[03:00:30]  Why did the music get really loud?  And why are they branching?  What are you doing?  Is this supposed to be your view?  Yeah, but he wasn't here before.  I know.  He's got a different angle.  Are you hiding from these people?  Yes, he is.  He's hiding on your lust-filled assignations.  The idea with handheld camera, it's supposed to be that it's kind of rough shot.  It's a chaotic feeling.  Yeah.  You have the feeling that the camera's not in a stable ground.  It's not sitting there.  But if you actually shake the camera back and forth on purpose, it's just fucking retarded. 
[03:01:00]  It wasn't shaking.  It was a gentle rock.  No, there's no gentle anything.  No, that was a fucking, like, earth seizure.  It looked like you were having a seizure.  That was you saying, I want this to look like a handheld camera.  But you would have if you just held it in your hands.  Cameraman Michael J. Fox.  Yeah, exactly.  It was rock above.  It was kind of a rock-a-bye.  No.  Family spills.  That's a new show.  You just shook a baby to death.  That's the type of shaking you were doing with a camera. 
[03:01:30]  Guest cameraman Ted Kennedy on the inauguration day.  Yes.  Yeah.  So you're saying that basically you were kind of shaking to give the feeling of realism  like the person's actually there.  Exactly.  It doesn't work.  I didn't have a tripod, so I used a paint shaker to put the camera on.  I didn't have a tripod, so I used Katharine Hepburn.  I mounted it in her cunt.  Paul, I think so far you're doing well with the review with Louis C.K.  He's...  Yeah, so far it's really good.  I think after I'm dead, this will become a huge thing. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah?  I mean, hopefully tomorrow it turns off the artist.  Because I'm going to murder you when they're going to find out it's because of this piece  of shit.  All right, let's go back.  We're almost done with our review.  It's going to be Exhibit A.  All right, let's see what happens.  And neither can I.  If you're not blind, I wish I was blind right now.  Some of the nudity coming right up.  Oh, wow, wow.  Forced abduction of people.  I hope not you.  A couple who appeared to meet up. 
[03:02:30]  Typical couplings in the night.  I mean, pointlessness of the common sexual behavior of modern society, human species.  Why is she laughing in the background?  She's not laughing.  Why is she screaming?  She's scared.  It's like, she's crying.  It's crying.  There's a naked girl on the couch in the background.  She's frightened.  How did she not really think you were going to kill her?  Like, you're that nuts. 
[03:03:00]  I would think you were making a snuff film.  Is that supposed to be a blood stain on the back wall there?  See, that's the kind of little details in the reviewing.  Yeah, little details.  Oh, my God.  People will pick it up.  You're right.  Going back and forth on the message board.  Is that supposed to be a blood stain?  Yeah, no, exactly.  You're supposed to be thinking, is that a blood stain?  You're not supposed to be going, did that idiot really think that I was going to think that's a blood stain?  Did they think for a second that I was going to buy that fucking red paint? 
[03:03:30]  What did you do?  You know, Jesus.  It looks like it was done with, like, a thin brush.  That's kind of thematic reinforcement, in a way.  No, it's not.  It's subliminal.  It's just a mistake on your part to have done such a shoddy job.  There's nothing subliminal about it.  It couldn't be more obvious.  It's in the back.  Oh, my God.  You don't want to be very obvious with it.  You just wanted to kind of put it there and let people think about it.  It's like subliminal.  Right, Jim.  It's something not subliminal, but like it. 
[03:04:00]  Do we at least get to see this girl's tits?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Who is the girl?  She's actually very good.  I don't care.  You can tell she's naked.  She's actually very good.  It's my brother-in-law's ex-wife.  Okay, good, good, good.  All right, let's go.  My ex-wife.  We got it.  Hey, the brother-in-law's ex-wife.  You mean your sister?  That doesn't make any sense.  To make it understood that this can be happening.  Weapon race.  Weapon race.  Yeah, thank you.  There's shears and a knife. 
[03:04:30]  And there's also some warm metal.  All right, let me just point something out.  There's a girl, a naked girl, over on the bed.  We look on her face like, come over any time, guys.  Instead, we're listening to a fat guy in an orange shirt.  With a horrendous mustache.  Say things that mean nothing.  Exactly.  This is good camera work, though, because...  And there's a light behind you, which is the most annoying thing in the world.  No, the light is from the camera.  It doesn't matter what the source of the light is. 
[03:05:00]  It's behind your stupid fucking head.  You can see the camera, man, and you're fucking painting on the wall.  It is really fucked up.  Is that the light from the camera in a reflection?  Yeah, then take that picture down.  If you remember Clockwork Arts, there was a lot of that kind of stuff.  Well, this is just like that.  Exactly.  How dare you.  How dare you.  It's one of the most carefully made beautiful films ever.  Fucking Cobra.  It deliberately looked like a porno film.  Yeah, it is.  This doesn't...  A porno director, you wouldn't get hired as a porno director.  I swear to God... 
[03:05:30]  If you gave this to a fucking porno company, they'd go, fuck you.  I swear to God...  They wouldn't hire you to swab the cum off the floor.  Jesus said he wanted Clockwork Arts to look like.  They wouldn't let you fluff the biggest, the ugliest fag on the set.  Your instincts are so poor that we don't even want you around here.  You're going to put something up.  We're talking about the camera work.  There's no fluff in it.  Good God.  Louie.  All right, go ahead.  All right.  That was intentional. 
[03:06:00]  It was absolutely intentional.  We want to see the naked chick, at least.  It's going to be a Zoom song.  She's really trying to get out of those ties.  She's frightened.  She's really moving.  I'm a big guy.  She kind of looks hot, though.  Yeah, she looks very hot.  She's very hot.  She reminded me of Angel Tompkins from the 70s.  She doesn't remind me of anybody because I can't see her because I'm looking at you.  If you remember, Angel Tompkins was a gorgeous actress in the 70s.  Right.  Good reference.  Thank you.  I'm letting anything else.  But soon my rambling will be over, and we'll do the Zoom. 
[03:06:30]  The rambling is good enough because it shows the state of mind.  Thank you.  He's getting up.  All right.  He's getting up.  He's getting up with the shears.  I will now do the sacrifice for the benefit of the viewers.  For the benefit of the viewers.  Who's...  Oh, your turn on the count.  I'm telling them that I'm doing this.  This is...  Oh, man.  She's scared.  She's acting.  Dude, what the fuck is she doing there?  How do you get a hot girl in the movie?  Oh, no.  She's acting.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  She looks frightened, though. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, turn up that music again.  There's a nipple.  What are you...  Are you...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, this is...  Oh, really?  The back of your leg?  As I say, I just killed her.  Oh, now it's...  How's the naked guy?  What the fuck?  All right.  We could talk about this.  All right.  Let's pause.  He killed her.  Okay.  Let's go to Louie, because Louie's...  Louie's moaning over there.  He's moaning. 
[03:07:30]  Wait.  Louie had a problem with the murder scene, Paul.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Louie.  The back of his leg.  We're hearing you going, eh.  And we had a very good opportunity to see a nice set of tits, and you wouldn't even give  us that in this crappy movie.  And you don't even throw, like, just a little jar of blood in the shot or something.  Yeah.  Why was there not a bloodless...  Would you use all the paint on the wall?  There was no more red paint.  Sorry.  There was a lot of blood later.  We brought in a guy who was actually good in a lot of...  Brought in a guy.  Brought in a guy.  Benjamin Moore.  And we used a lot of the old school... 
[03:08:00]  You know, where we mixed things in the kitchen.  You must have cut all that out.  It was late.  Because I just saw the back of your leg and heard you flinting.  Yeah, where's the murder?  In fact, that wasn't horrifying.  It's implied.  Was she dead?  Implied.  At the end of that?  Because her tits were still moving up and down like she was still breathing.  I thought you said it's a slasher movie.  People don't die right away.  They even did...  Oh, wow.  When people were guillotined, they even did a study back in the old days about how long  the heads would respond.  Can we try that now?  Sometimes 10 seconds. 
[03:08:30]  Who did the study?  Who funded it?  Guys who were interested in guillotines back then.  Yeah, you know what?  You're right.  That's the best murder scene I ever saw.  You just talked me into enjoying it.  Taking him over.  You just debated it into a good scene.  Holy shit.  Instead of actually shooting anything that matters.  I think with repeat viewing.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Not with repeat viewing.  Especially in this day.  Yeah, repeat viewing.  No one has time for repeat viewing.  Well, repeat viewing.  Come on.  Cut him some slack.  Is that no filter Paul now on your couch? 
[03:09:00]  No, it's not.  Couldn't even take the shit off the coffee table.  The shit on the coffee table, it's just somebody had to walk over there and just take that off  the coffee table and you can see 90% more of the person's face.  You didn't have a set dresser there?  The production designer decided that this was good because the obscuring of the food.  Oh yeah, blame your production designer.  And why is your couch covered with a blanket or something?  You didn't want to get the fake blood on your house?  There's no fake blood.  There wasn't any.  No.  It's because he's at somebody's house where they're like, don't let the naked person on  my couch. 
[03:09:30]  It's disgusting.  Right.  For your stupid movie.  No, it's not going to make any money, you idiot.  You'll see.  All right.  Should we move on?  All right.  Let's move on a little bit.  Why did you paint on my wall?  Now, I think we should fast forward to the no filter Paul scene, especially because-  This is good, though.  By the way, this scene right here is exactly the same.  The same camera, the same babble, and the same bad murder, only instead of the hot chick,  now you have some fucking guy on the couch. 
[03:10:00]  Same thing.  Yes.  There was no difference.  This is not a filmmaker.  This is a guy with a message that he's trying to inform.  Don't just do it in the third person like it's not you sitting here with the shitty movie.  Paulo, do you kill people for real?  We just haven't found the bodies yet.  You know, like he was talking about-  He can't answer a question.  No.  The answer to that question would be no.  You were in Caddyshack, weren't you?  Yes, I was. 
[03:10:30]  Who'd you play in Caddyshack?  I was, uh, the main scenes I'm in are in the swimming pool scene, I'm the waiter who  gets knocked into the pool, and in the dining room scene, I'm the waiter acting up a storm  in the, right behind the main actors.  How, uh, how'd you, you had to audition for that?  I was in, uh, I was in, uh, Little Mary Sunshine in, uh, in college down in Boca Raton, and then-  That's not an answer to that question.  That's how-  And they auditioned the people from that play, and I was the only one who got a-  You're the one that gets knocked into the pool?  Yeah.  I'm kind of impressed. 
[03:11:00]  You still get residuals for that, or is it not like this?  They, uh, you know-  The answer to Jim's question was yes, you auditioned, though.  Yes.  Oh, it wasn't the, uh, yes.  Did you audition for that movie?  I, I drove to-  But yes.  No, we need an answer.  I was in the C lot, and I took the ticket to see-  But did you audition?  Excuse me.  I went to the office, I told them I was there-  All right.  To see, uh, Ellen Janssen's cast-  Because she was the one that was casting it, so did you audition?  And please let me finish.  So then I took the sides-  Did you fucking audition? 
[03:11:30]  I'm going to choke you.  Excuse me, I took the sides off the table, and I-  Yes, I-  When I read for the camera, then I auditioned.  Oh, shit.  And I actually went back for a second audition, which I blew.  Oh, my God.  Who'd you blow?  Oh, my God.  It was in a hotel room, and they said, no, I cut it off.  Why don't we, uh, continue with this murder?  Because I, I got to see this murder now, because it's just like-  It's also, like, low resolution.  Yeah, why is-  It's, like, hard to look at.  It's low contrast, low resolution.  I know damn well.  It's all digi, it's like-  You weren't trying for this look. 
[03:12:00]  You wanted something cleaner.  Did you want a grainy look?  You wanted a grainy look?  No, I wanted a grainy look.  No, you didn't.  Why?  I swear to God, I love the grainy look.  That's not grainy.  That's not grainy.  It's called noise.  That's not knowing what fucking kind of file you're putting on your computer.  Don't look at Clockwork Orange.  That's what happens.  I edit video all day, and when it comes out like that, I go, ah, shit.  There's a lot of grainy.  Yeah, try again, but you don't do things twice.  What were you saying about Clockwork Orange?  Use the wrong compression on it or some shit.  There's a lot of graininess because you do it in Lola.  Barry Lyndon has a lot of graininess because they do it with candlelight. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, you should fucking shoot yourself in the face for comparing those two things.  Oh my God, he's comparing.  You know what he did to make-  Barry Lyndon is a movie that's shot entirely with natural light.  Right.  There's no electricity used in the movie.  Right.  Stop saying right like it has anything to do with it.  And the way he did that was Stanley Kubrick found lenses that were built back like the  first lenses ever made back when they only had that kind of like he went and did all  this research in historical archaeology and dug up these equipment. 
[03:13:00]  He didn't have to, though.  All he had to do was turn on a fucking flip cam and edit it on iMovie with some unlicensed  music that you're going to get sued for using and refusing.  And somebody probably said, hey, don't you want to move that light that's glaring in  the light?  No, it's okay because I have a heart on it.  I want to keep doing this right now.  I'm just saying there are similarities to Barry Lyndon.  There isn't a single one.  Similarities.  Wow.  Louis Field's getting mad. 
[03:13:30]  All right, let's get this murder out of the way.  Yes, let's keep going.  Sure.  ...experience at this point in that the idea of-  Now, here, I had him, who I-  I always feel the male is the guiltier of the species.  The more vile, the more evil, the real predator, the real source of all that is wrong with  society.  Did somebody off camera just cough?  Yeah.  I did hear that.  Can you please roll it back?  You really did hear that.  It just never happened.  And again, we need to sacrifice- 
[03:14:00]  Nobody's respecting the set like they're sitting-  They're walking-  You can hear them walking around.  No, there's-  There was a cough in the studio here.  How did the-  That is wrong with society.  If somehow women could take control and take over, it might be-  There is somebody cough!  I thought it would have been him.  He's choking in the background.  Yes, that wasn't him.  It's the same way.  All right.  Oh, there's that boring knife again.  Would you just use the cam mic? 
[03:14:30]  Whatever.  We'll see-  No, it was a good music camera.  For what?  Oh, he's acting.  Oh, he's acting.  It's really not personal.  It's just that-  It's just to-  This film will hopefully be seen by everyone.  No, it won't.  And yeah, you're going to die-  Everybody have a shitty day!  Everybody have a shitty day!  You're going to die soon.  I'm having a shitty day right now.  You don't even know her name.  No!  I wish I was him really living that moment.  I'd rather be that guy really tied up on a couch.  Getting shears in you.  Let me go.  Yeah.  Than watching it happen. 
[03:15:00]  That was convincing.  Let me go.  Let me go.  I don't know her name.  I don't know your name!  Yeah, you don't know her name.  You don't know my name.  I'll get somebody out.  Okay.  I can meet another guy!  Was there a script?  It's really not about-  The way this was done.  Yes or no question.  It's a yes or no question.  It was for Larry David.  It's a yes or no question.  That's right.  Was there a script?  Well, I bought a computer.  No.  I got final draft, which is a script writing program.  I bought some paper with three holes in the sides. 
[03:15:30]  And some brats.  I then proceeded to write some-  So there wasn't a script.  We had extensive interviews with everyone involved in the film.  So there would be a common ground.  When I interacted with them, I would know everything.  Kind of like everybody working towards the same goal in their own way.  Right, right.  Of course.  I interviewed everyone.  I want to fucking choke, Jimmy.  Why?  I want to choke you out. 
[03:16:00]  I actually understand where he's going with this.  I want to Vince McMahon your head.  I'm not saying there aren't certain things that could probably be fixed in post, but I do  think that it's a lot better.  Everybody's just kind of razzling you.  Yeah.  They're right.  I think Busty Balls is what I'm used to on the message crew.  That's part of it.  That's what makes us funny.  Sure.  I know what's going on here, by the way.  You're going to turn into a real serial killer, and then this movie's going to be like,  holy fuck, you know that serial killer?  That probably would be the best way to sell it.  Right.  It'd be all over the news.  You're going to have to kill people, Paula.  Well, let's just say we're at the beginning of our marketing strategy.  Oh, so murder isn't out of the question as far as the marketing strategy goes. 
[03:16:30]  We are at the beginning of it.  If they pick you up for being a serial killer, then this thing is going to have some legs,  my friend.  Some legs.  Let's get to them.  Just don't kill me.  Soon enough, you're going to be dead, and it's moments away.  Moments away, and the pain will be bad for the first few seconds, but trust me, it won't  be that long before you are lost in oblivion.  If this was, let me say something about what you just said.  If this was a filming, if he murdered this person, and then tried to sell it, like as 
[03:17:00]  a ghoulish, you got to see this, even the, he wouldn't be convicted of the murder, if  this was the evidence, because the fucking cops and the jury would start watching it and  go, just turn it, let him go, turn it off.  I don't want to watch this.  I don't want to watch this.  I don't want to watch it until the point where I witness the murder and put him in jail.  All right.  The dialogue was kind of chilling, though.  Pause for a second.  Because I want to comment on his dialogue, where you're walking this guy through the 
[03:17:30]  fact that you're going to kill him, and he's pretty much helpless, and he has to hear  what's in your pocket?  What is in your pocket there?  I believe, that's my wallet.  It's kind of a big wallet.  Yeah.  So why did you have your wallet while you're filming?  Can you leave that on your dresser or something?  No, that's cool.  Cappy.  Oh my God.  Let's get to the murder.  I mean, maybe.  Stop this.  Is it a short thing?  I was going to say, Cappy, copies of your DVD in there.  Let's look at the back of his leg again.  There's a lot more blood later in the movie. 
[03:18:00]  Sure.  And, you know, most of these murder movies don't have a lot of blood, and you actually  do get a lot of implied violence, and a lot of things that are pretty terrifying.  Where are you stabbing him?  You're showing his chest and head.  Where are you stabbing him?  He's marking the lower torso.  I don't see.  No, no, no.  There's nothing there.  I don't see.  It's below the camera.  Yeah.  Out of view of camera.  Jesus.  Oh my God.  Where are you stabbing him in the ass?  Where are you just stabbing him?  Ass and balls?  Ass and balls.  There's no blood.  Yeah, he looks as though he's being stabbed in the balls right now. 
[03:18:30]  Look at the look on his face.  Look how bored that guy is.  You just lay there.  You can roll onto the floor.  He's like, oh, let me know.  You didn't have much of a budget, so why wouldn't you use all your blood early in the movie to  really get people hooked?  Yeah.  Why waste all the blood later on when no one is still there watching?  Louis' groans are the best, like, review you could ever have.  It's just, uh, you know.  All right, let's see how this guy does.  Paul, were you trying to purposely avoid the violence on camera because it's like a 
[03:19:00]  Hitchcock vibe all the time?  And that's, believe me, you'd be surprised if we listed the amount of films where the  violence happens off the camera and it's in the floor.  Like what?  Name one movie.  Yeah, but you're not implying violence in this scene.  You're showing that it's definitely not happening.  Because you're showing the vital organs of the person.  And there's nothing wrong?  So you are proving that there's definitely, you're making it very clear that the person  is yelling for no reason.  We're not seeing his penis.  We don't see his penis.  If you cut off somebody's dick and ate it, they wouldn't die for three days. 
[03:19:30]  Right.  Thank you, Louis.  I had a long metal thing that could have gone up his ass.  Oh, sure.  All right, it's implied up the ass.  Sure.  You could have made a better movie if you cared at all.  It was $5,000 in this scene.  It's not even lack of skill.  It's just not giving a shit.  Three days.  Remember that, too.  All was experimental.  And, of course, experimental, three days, right.  That's not how you get reviews.  Well, we've got to give him a break.  It only took, you know, a month instead of two months to film the movie.  Yeah, you look at the, what was the desperado that Robert Rodriguez did. 
[03:20:00]  That was the big way.  There you go.  Now he's Rodriguez.  No, no, no, no moment.  Are you comparing yourself to Robert?  You look at Evil Dead 1, very shoddy looking.  But this is supposed to look shoddy looking.  And this is what's not being acknowledged.  The original Evil Dead did kind of have, like, a very low-grade quality to it, but the horror was there.  Right.  Exactly.  Now, let's get to the murder.  What's happening here?  Oh, that's it?  That's it for the murder?  Yeah, that's it.  We have a lot of murders in this film, so you need to... 
[03:20:30]  Now we're down some little lane.  The tree's on his side with some chick from the back.  Now she's tied up.  Look at the ropes.  You're right.  They're loose.  Oh, the bad loose rope.  She's already tied the ropes right.  Don't move, honey, because it'll be so clear how loosely her tied up.  Yeah, that's what else is happening here.  She's clearly drugged.  That's like how they used to tie up the people on Gilligan's Island. 
[03:21:00]  Like when some bad guy would get on the island and tie him up.  There's just no realism to that tie up.  And they had lots of money on Gilligan's Island.  Oh, yes.  Let me...  You know, the great Sherwood Schwartz.  Yeah, he would.  If you looked at some of his works.  His budgets were so high.  The Brady Bunch.  Gilligan's Island.  How'd you get the hot girl in your film, though?  That's actually no filter balls.  Is that...  Oh, fuck, yeah.  She is hot as shit. 
[03:21:30]  That's his daughter?  Yeah.  She's got hot daughters.  I want to date no filter Paul's daughter.  If you look at the side of her face, you can also see the duct tape clearly coming up and off the face.  Yeah.  I would have that duct tape off my cock in a second.  Just plow no filter Paul's daughter's mouth.  I have to get back to the fact that, all things aside, this was an experiment.  Sure.  All things aside.  Movies, though?  I tried to do something.  It is what it is.  And my life is fucked up, so I need people to buy this movie so we can start the movement.  I can move on to the second thing. 
[03:22:00]  The movement.  The movement.  So the gastrointestinal.com...  Wait, what's the second phase?  Well, the second phase would be to go out and start promoting harmony and love through fear and death.  Yep.  That is actually a...  He's going to start killing people.  I don't know.  No, but he's making a social statement, though.  Play this tape back, so...  Polo's going to start telling people...  5,000...  Wait, how much did you spend on this?  5,000.  That's crazy.  What did you do with the money?  I know, where did the money go?  I didn't think a penny of it on the screen.  Where the fuck did the money go?  You must have ate well in those three days. 
[03:22:30]  Where's this film?  The St. Regis?  Where the fuck are you staying?  This was up near Woodstock.  $5,000 for what?  How much is a hotel up in fucking Woodstock?  It's like 10 bucks.  $5,000 for what?  Well, we had a...  Somebody, you got...  Where'd you get the money?  Where'd you get the $5,000?  There was a couple of people, and then...  Oh, fuck.  And then I had to wind up buying out one guy, because there was...  All right.  ...conflicts.  Oh, God.  Sure.  So you went to somebody here, so you went to somebody and said, hey, if you give me  $5,000, I'll make a movie, and they said, you know what, you're a pain in the ass, but 
[03:23:00]  you know, I want to give you this.  All right.  So they gave you the money.  Listen, I know what happened.  Let me tell you.  And you took the money.  I don't know what your vice is, but you blew all of it, and then you made this piece of  shit with nothing.  We know that the worst piece of crap movie out there cost $200,000, $500,000.  $500,000.  You could have made a lovely movie for $5,000.  That's plenty of money.  No.  Who makes a movie for $5,000?  Exactly.  You could make a much better movie.  Well, you didn't. 
[03:23:30]  You spent the money on whatever it is you do.  I don't know what it is.  I need $145,000 right now to pay off my credit card.  Well, yeah.  So I'm glad that's where the $5,000 then ends.  I've got two houses I can't unload.  I've got a horrible life.  I've got one good woman.  Listen, I'm sorry, but I still hate the movie.  So, Paul, who's the girl on the scene?  What's her thing?  She was, again, an example of a young member of society who doesn't care and needs to be sacrificed for the greater good. 
[03:24:00]  Sure.  The greater good.  Okay.  Of what?  I don't know.  All right, let's push play.  It won't matter.  So in a minute, I'll slice your wrist, we'll empty your blood into a bucket.  It's a matter of...  Now, I'm putting that shirt on eBay because you can tell that that's from the...  But it's the ramblings of a man.  You're putting the shirt...  You were serious right there.  I was.  I haven't done it yet. 
[03:24:30]  I don't know.  I couldn't even come in with the duct tape.  You're right.  She's on drugs.  I really don't even know what...  She's obviously drugged.  You know, he just feels that the duct tape was necessary.  You figure where you don't go to heaven because you just...  To reinforce in her mind that it was coming soon.  The point is that at one point, when it could be a million years, which is nothing.  I mean, she's like breathing through her mouth with duct tape over it.  She's like, hurry up and...  Yeah, it's like, oh my God, is this scene over yet? 
[03:25:00]  How long am I supposed to heave my breasts like this?  Right now, you're going to cease to exist.  And there is no consciousness.  I wish I had no consciousness.  I do.  Oh, they wait.  They cut in for a second.  Go back to that.  Yeah, I know.  Isn't that amazing?  There was another shot.  There was a different shot.  You're actually deciding to do a cut in.  I agree.  There was a little insert cut in there.  You actually called me on a good point, that there really should not be any visible editing  in this movie.  What did you do that for?  Did you do that to put together two shitty takes of you? 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  My editor loved the shot.  Or did you want really to be really clear to everyone that that duct tape is not doing  anything to restrain her mouth?  My editor loved the shot, so he stuck it in there.  Loved the shot, but if it's...  My editor.  If it's one...  My editor.  If it's one guy that's working the camera, what did you...  Your psychopath that fucking, you know, used his final cut pro?  Yeah.  So you had other shots.  You took in...  You went in, you got other shots.  Right.  But the point was, that was an abnormality in the film.  It shouldn't have happened, but it did. 
[03:26:00]  And it's a nice show.  The tape is up on both sides.  The tape is...  If she licks her lips, the tape falls off.  Yes.  You can see she's practically sleeping now.  She's on drunk.  She's bored of this shitty movie that she's in.  She's drugged.  She's drugged.  You're putting her to sleep with the...  Literally, a person who's about to get murdered is falling asleep because the murderer is so boring.  It'll be like when you see those beheading videos, and the guy with the hood is reading the Arabic,  and the guy, you know, the fucking tied-up guy turns back and goes, 
[03:26:30]  could you fucking just cut my head off?  All right.  This is boring.  Towards the...  One of the final scenes is when I'm carrying a drugged person...  We're never going to get there.  I'm sorry, Paul.  ...physically into the scene and then I'm dressing them.  Yeah.  All right.  Push play.  Consciousness.  So I'm going to cut you now.  And, um, you're going to be scared.  It's going to be painful.  It's going to hurt.  Okay, so don't move.  Don't move. 
[03:27:00]  Don't move because I don't want to cut myself.  Okay.  See?  Oh, you're missing the fake blood.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Is it still moving?  We will be cutting to a dripping scene, actually.  Wait, can you go back?  Wait, was that he was supposed to be stabbing her just now?  I think he's cutting with the wrong side of the knife.  Dude, you're cutting with the...  Go back.  Were you cutting with the back end of the knife?  This is actually a prop knife.  He's supposed to, uh...  He's supposed to cut a wrist.  All right.  A prop knife?  Which has, you know, where it's cut out.  Watch this.  Move.  Move.  Move because I don't want to cut myself. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, careful.  Yeah.  Watch.  Look at this.  All the side of the knife.  You're using a prop knife when you're using the wrong end of it?  No.  I couldn't possibly use the wrong side of the phone.  The point of a prop knife is you can cut with the blade and it won't hurt anybody because  it's made of plastic.  Then how come it looks like it's on the back of the knife?  It looks like it's on the back of the knife.  I couldn't have...  It was like...  It's fucked up.  It's like paint by numbers.  There's a hole in the knife where you stick the wrist in.  That fucking knife was a $5,000 knife right there.  It was a $5,000 prop knife. 
[03:28:00]  That was also the most clumsy...  Hey, let's lift this up into the shot.  Yeah, let's see everybody.  Yeah, yeah.  Look, everybody.  Don't be fooled just by her amazing acting in mine.  I'm really doing this, see?  Look at this thing I bought at the Funny Costume Store.  Look at my niece's Halloween costume that we're using in this movie.  This is...  It's a nice rope, too.  It's a nice thick rope.  I thought it looked good.  Yeah, why don't you make it tight so it's more believable? 
[03:28:30]  Let's go.  This is worse than like an Ed Wood movie.  It is worse.  It's not worse than an Ed Wood movie.  Oh, not at all.  It is much worse.  These are real locations.  So much worse.  It is much worse.  Ed Wood movies had, like, bullshit.  Slots?  No, they had sets where the walls were shaking.  Oh, that's crazy, right?  Yeah, and you have people coughing in the background.  Somebody may cough in the middle of a murder, serial killing.  Cut, print, perfect.  It's three days.  Yeah, it's a bucket. 
[03:29:00]  Take a fourth.  If you're going to feel less and less.  Defending it, like, we only had three days.  Take another day.  Four days.  It's scary.  You must be feeling pretty bad about it.  I'm feeling pretty bad right now.  This is like your last minute on Earth.  I wish it was my last minute on Earth.  I wish it was the last minute of the movie.  Man, you're gone.  I mean, in the context of eternity...  How did fucking No Filter Paul conjure up that chick?  The fuck is that?  He's probably a stepdaughter. 
[03:29:30]  Huh?  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're right.  Okay.  Now, truthfully...  Oh, boy, truthfully, yes.  If you...  Hopefully, at some point, when this movie is out, and people don't know about it...  It is out.  No, but I know.  I know.  At this point, I haven't really promoted...  Yeah.  I haven't really fully promoted it.  All right.  And I'm going to continue to promote it.  We're going to call Ron and Fez.  And in years from now...  Years from now, right.  They're going to say...  People are going to find this movie, and they're going to say, what the fuck is this?  And believe me, that's the reaction that's going to happen with people. 
[03:30:00]  They're going to be confused because they won't know the backstory.  Let me say it now.  We all know some of the backstory.  I'm saying, what the fuck is this now?  But it's because...  Also because you know the backstory.  Yes.  But those that don't know the backstory will be more...  No, they'll just say, some guy grabbed a camera and some friends and made a shitty movie.  I think.  I think.  You see, you think.  But you're looking at it...  I don't know.  You're right.  You're perspective.  You know something?  You're absolutely right.  Fucking Mall Cop was the number one movie for two weeks in a row. 
[03:30:30]  Who am I to say?  Yeah, like Mall Cop.  And you notice I lost a lot of weight.  You look good.  I lost 60 pounds in six months.  Mostly from stress from the divorce.  That's good for you.  It's a healthy way to lose weight.  And then Magic Johnson died.  It's the only hope.  Yeah.  Oh.  All righty.  Here we go.  Just savor this moment.  Just be calm.  Mm-hmm.  Just enjoy it.  Just breathe in.  Breathe out.  Lift the air. 
[03:31:00]  Fill your lungs.  That's what breathing is.  Two times.  Now, truth will let these out.  Oh, let's just go ahead and cue that right there.  As good as any place.  Drop that right in there.  It's as good as any place.  It's fine.  Holy fuck.  Just fucking drop some unestablished music right in there.  Holy fucking killing me.  Just put that anywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Just drop that anywhere.  Wherever.  Subliminally, you have to use some standard horror of this. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, but you put them in a fucking place where you had a thought.  You know, just drop it randomly.  And you least expected it.  Oh, you dropped in there.  I fully expected it.  Nothing to do with expectations.  Right.  Fucking.  Really?  You weren't expecting that?  Honestly, you weren't expecting that?  No.  No.  Mm-hmm.  No, I wasn't expecting to have my day ruined. 
[03:32:00]  All right.  And, you know.  Wait a minute.  Is this still going on?  When you can't tell if it's.  Hold on a second.  This is a freeze frame on a moment that doesn't matter.  We're listening to the music.  I thought we paused so we can talk about it.  Live in the music.  And then it just dawned on me.  Wait a minute.  I'm still hearing that shit music.  But it's pause.  You freeze frame.  I was watching her die.  Making people fucking check their.  People are going to have two remotes in each hand. 
[03:32:30]  Okay, my TV's fucked up.  My video.  Wait a minute.  Did I press pause by mistake?  How am I hearing the music when I press pause?  If you experience the movie in the proper setting.  I mean, here we are commenting on the movie.  Actually, we're not allowed to experience.  Here, I'm actually watching her die.  And there is that chilling moment where I'm just watching her die.  And that's all.  It's nothing else but silence and the music.  Silence and the music.  Watching her die.  And you may have thought it was paused. 
[03:33:00]  And that's interesting because that's how still this moment is.  Oh, it's not paused.  You guys just aren't moving.  It's still.  The movie's still playing too, right?  I think we've had push play.  Oh, okay.  Now it's playing.  What happens up top there?  Something to keep it clear.  It's a fucking window dressing that I...  Oh.  Oh, he moved.  Oh, some of the blood.  Oh, no.  She's bleeding down her hands.  Oh, you decided to use some of your blood, huh? 
[03:33:30]  No, she certainly isn't.  No.  Now we get to the local divorce.  Oh, just a wow sticker.  Oh, great.  All I need to say is...  Great.  Great.  We got our fucking wow sticker in there.  Thanks for putting a wow sticker in this shitty film.  Can we sue?  Great, thanks.  Can we sue that he now has to digitize that out on every copy?  That would rule.  Please.  Let's do that.  Gabthemovie.com.  You can use the promo code RonFez.  I need you to buy this movie.  Trust me.  It will.  And I would be happy to autograph them down the road.  Oh. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  Well, no, that's...  All right.  I do start killing people.  It will be something worth it.  At least it'll...  Yeah, you'll have a signature on there.  That's...  Can you do some kind of stunt for us today?  Well, I...  Obviously, I had sent a memo out about all kinds of horrible things.  The first thing you can do is have all your interns come and punch me in the stomach  as hard as they want to.  That'd be fun.  I hope it ends like Houdini.  You can get 70 people.  Didn't he die from that?  Danny's got an email, uh...  Punching the stomach?  ...from Paul O.  An email from Paul O.  Well, it's not actually from Paul O. 
[03:34:30]  Ah, okay.  It's from, according to this, it's from his manager and life coach.  Let me get his name here for you guys.  Dr. Machine Gun.  Do you know a Dr. Machine Gun?  Yeah, he's sort of a manifesto.  What medical school do your Dr. Machine Guns go to?  And if you read this thing, which is fairly long, it details what could happen to me today  under these circumstances.  And I was trying to avoid it, but I mean, I'm not going to argue with my life coach.  And so... 
[03:35:00]  What?  Who is Dr. Machine Gun?  That doesn't sound like a reputable doctor.  I hope an actual Machine Gun is your life coach.  That's good.  So, he suggested I do all these things that are detailed in this.  Oh, it's horrible.  Like what?  It's horrible.  Like piercings and stabbings and all kinds of things.  As we get up to a certain sales level, I would have more and more horrible things happen to me.  But obviously, I was telling him, that was crazy stuff.  That sounds crazy.  Well, I have a list here, so let's see. 
[03:35:30]  It says here that if Paul sold 10 DVDs, he would get three needle piercings through his arm skin.  Another 10 is another three.  Another 10, he goes for the legs.  So, that's one level.  And then up to 50, then you could slap...  We could shave his body and slap him with rubbing alcohol.  75 copies of Gap sold will pierce his bottom lip.  And then, I mean, then the levels get kind of retarded, because then there's 100, 400,  like he really thinks he's going to sell 400 of these things.  400. 
[03:36:00]  What's 400?  What do you do for 400?  Oh, 400.  There will be a...  This is according...  This is not me.  These are not my ideas.  This is courtesy of Dr. Machine Gun.  Yes.  There will be a staff challenge where an intern can poop on his head.  I didn't come up with...  Did you pay this guy?  I didn't come up with...  Paul, did you pay this guy?  I paid him.  But he's a very cool guy who wants to make horror movies, and I like him a lot.  And we have long conversations at night.  And he said, yeah, I'm going to...  Hang on.  I wasn't finished.  Let's see. 
[03:36:30]  At 425 copies, he'll drink fresh, hot intern piss with a blob of Big A cum in it.  Wait.  Really?  How many copies?  425.  All right.  Let's pull on these sources.  You might want to hang around for 450.  People are raising their hands out there.  At 450, they'll pierce Paul's nutsack in four places with a hammer and small nails.  And I never really...  He said he researched all this, but I never got the feeling that I was sure that I was 
[03:37:00]  safe under these things.  Are we done with this?  No.  The similarities to Kubrick just keep piling up.  Yeah.  That's what Kubrick did.  All right.  And just so you know that this very long email...  Yes.  It's like Jerry Maguire.  Yeah.  Just like it.  It ends with Dr. Machine Gun saying, Paul is a complete lunatic and cannot handle the  pressure of even the most simple of tasks.  Yours truly, Dr. Machine Gun.  He's a doctor, so he does know well.  Yeah.  He's got a doctor in his name. 
[03:37:30]  And Machine Gun.  All right.  Louie, obviously you're my biggest critic right now.  Because I'm one of three people that have seen the movie.  Give me an honest benefit of the doubt.  If we're not sitting here, you know, busting balls, it's truthfully.  We haven't even seen the No Filtered Pulse.  We've seen a few minutes of the movie.  Clearly, if you're sitting down to see a movie, we haven't looked at the whole movie.  It's just in hysterics laughing right now, by the way.  Or the trajectory of what's happening.  Right, right, right.  The fact that it's an anti-film and all these things.  Give me the benefit of the doubt. 
[03:38:00]  All right.  He'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  You earn the benefit of the doubt.  All right.  This is loose.  With a movie.  When you make a movie, you earn the benefit of the doubt by people watching it.  And they go, okay, I'll give this the benefit of the doubt.  But whatever the opposite of the benefit of the doubt is, instead is what you establish.  Which is in a way.  Is that you don't give a shit what this movie looks like.  That's the main thing.  If somebody here...  Look, I've sat through a lot of fucked up movies. 
[03:38:30]  I've made some fucked up movies.  I've taken part in some fucked up production.  Before I was in film, even.  I was trying to get him to look it up, but he couldn't find it.  There was this guy, when I was a kid, his name was David Van Vactor.  And I worked for Cablevision in Marblehead, Massachusetts.  Like, covering hockey games and stuff.  And I met this guy through my friend who said, I want to make an avant-garde film.  So we brought home some of the video packages from work and shot this guy's movie, which  was just him blathering like that.  And he would make a long speech and read a poem. 
[03:39:00]  And then he holds up this jar and he says, look, it's my piss.  And he had his piss in a jar.  And then he'd go back to reading poems.  That's what the movie was.  So I've been down this road.  Yeah, it's a fucking epic compared to this dog shit.  I'd like to see this film.  But it's everybody.  Hold on, let him finish, Paula.  Jesus.  And I went, I was once in Harvard, in San Francisco, at the Castro Movie Theater.  And I saw a movie that was, it was called Father and Mother.  It was a Russian film. 
[03:39:30]  And here's, I'm going to describe to you 15 minutes of the film.  There's a woman dying.  And her young son, who's like in his 20s, is sitting next to her.  And she's wheezing, and he's watching her wheeze.  And then he says, do you want anything?  And she says, yeah, I want you to take me out to sit in the garden.  So he carries her out, puts her on a bench, and then watches her there.  That's 40 minutes of the movie.  I'm not kidding.  Nothing happens.  I sat through the whole thing, because I gave it the benefit of the doubt.  I'm like, this is least interesting.  I've never seen anything like this. 
[03:40:00]  Don't mind, Jimmy.  He'll snap up and say something every so often.  There you go.  Jimmy got all scared.  I actually did those.  You were frightened.  All right, so the context is that I don't like mainstream movies.  I am the fucking target audience for this kind of film.  This is shit.  I am the closest you're ever going to get to someone who would give a shit. 
[03:40:30]  And the reason is because that crazy David Van Vector with his piss palms and the fucking  retarded Russian, who I am one of eight people who saw that movie, they really cared about  how they made it.  It didn't mean that they shot it professionally or slickly.  It means that they gave a shit.  They didn't just fuck up and not try again.  They fucking mixed it so you could hear what the guy was saying.  This is just shit.  First of all, number one, we know that this is experimental film. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, God, no, okay, that's it.  We know that it's supposed to look like this.  This has got to defend his heart, I guess.  You ever seen the early films, the short films of David Lynch, for instance?  Again, David Lynch now.  How dare you drag him into this?  He has brought up names of legendary directors, artsy directors, and then I look up and just  see that.  A wow sticker on a car. 
[03:41:30]  Did you do any second takes?  Not with the no filter pulse stuff, because it's all gold.  It really is.  What?  How bad is the no filter pulse stuff?  It's so, it goes on forever.  Can we see maybe a tiny bit of that?  Yeah, just get to that part.  It's right now.  Is there a chapter?  It's coming up?  This is it?  20 minutes?  Oh, the music.  That's in there.  I still feel the fall in this car.  Trying not to laugh.  Lay it across his car seat. 
[03:42:00]  He fell asleep in his car.  Yeah, I'm picking off the easy trick.  Now it's just him, shirtless, badly tied up to a chair.  Bouncing around like a cartoon character.  So what?  Did you kill him and then put his shirt back on?  No.  I got him.  He was drugged out from a night of...  Oh, God.  I had no potency that day. 
[03:42:30]  I wasn't getting my message across, but that pig was so...  Well, wait a minute.  Now you're both talking.  Now you're talking on screen and off screen.  Right.  Now you're fucking narrating and talking at the same time.  As a...  Not on purpose.  No, it's because you just fucked that you were like...  As a psycho, I did edit and I did look at my...  And prepare it.  And he rips off like clerks or something.  I was about to say, why are you ripping off Kevin Smith with the dramatic title cards  with the words on there and then going to different scenes like Kevin Smith? 
[03:43:00]  Well, he ripped off people way before that.  I mean, like...  Wow.  Well, Kevin Smith...  We're not arguing Kevin Smith's, you know, filmatic integrity.  We're talking about your piece of garbage.  I'm saying that these are things that are not used that often, and they need to be brought  back from time to time.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Throw it in there.  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And what am I saying?  Interesting things, you know, musical terms, which comment on the action. 
[03:43:30]  What comment?  There's no comment being made.  Agitated.  With excitement.  Agitated.  Oh, you mean the word comment?  The words you actually wrote upon the screen?  Yes.  Ah.  No.  Right.  Well, let her up.  Cross anyhow.  I don't give any credence to any of you worthless scum, but I will appreciate you enough to  avoid the moral bankruptcy of obscenity.  I'm telling you, tough sucker!  I'm bleeping out anything that he has to say, because that's not exactly part of my message. 
[03:44:00]  This, by the way, goes on for how long?  Oh, it's probably a 15-minute scene.  15 minutes.  15 minutes of just what you're seeing right here.  Oh, my God.  It's Paul trying to get out of the shitty tie job.  He jiggles and curses for 14 and a half minutes.  Yeah, just jiggling and saying, fuck you.  Let me out of here, you fucking cocksucker.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  And then, uh, Polo is just rambling through the whole thing. 
[03:44:30]  Uh, I think we're pretty well engaged in this thing, back and forth.  You have to make some sort of a statement.  Look how bored he gets between strugglings.  Yeah.  He kind of looks around like, are we done now?  Shit!  Hello, I'm timey, you cunt!  Okay, so then he does that.  He looks at people off camera.  Yeah, he looks at the cameraman.  Oh, there's another special shot, a little insert there.  What's your problem, Dick?  I went to the camera, adjusted the camera, and we're still on that shot. 
[03:45:00]  We're still sitting on this insert shot of his legs.  Why are we looking at this?  Because this is clearly something that would not be in a normal film.  You won't see a shot completely ill-framed like that.  Am I correct or not?  What the fuck is happening here, Louis C.K.?  That's what's happening in this movie.  What the fuck is happening?  Do you understand?  No, no, you can't.  You didn't try.  You didn't try.  You didn't try.  That's exactly it.  There wasn't any effort to...  No, you didn't try.  I swear...  You got sleepy.  I swear... 
[03:45:30]  You felt sleepy.  Look, it happens all the time.  You're making a movie, and you go, oh, fuck, could I just get out of here?  And then you go, wait a minute.  I got to at least try to...  Even if I'm trying to do something shoddy, I got to try to do the best version of it.  I need everybody out there.  I took somebody's $5,000.  He spent it on some weird clothes that I bought.  He's the Ron and Fez promo code.  Holy shit.  I think we're finally even with Ron and Fez.  Wow.  For the Earl thing.  Holy shit. 
[03:46:00]  It is exactly what Louis said.  It's not like, yeah, you're looking going, holy shit, what is this?  No, you would do that if the movie was done well, and someone gave a shit about it.  And then you would look and say, wow, what is this?  This is kind of weird.  This is like you just didn't put effort into it.  You said you wanted to make a movie.  That's the problem.  There was more effort in you saying, I want to make a movie than making the movie.  This is an anti-film.  It is meant to... 
[03:46:30]  Just keep saying this.  What is an anti-film?  What I need you to understand is that it means it doesn't use the editing process.  No, that's not the case.  Yes.  But here, you see, when you see a film, most people are willing to put the suspension of  belief into a film.  They know the process of making a film that has all these edits.  Here, we take the editing out.  No, you don't, because you edit a lot in this scene.  Yeah, you edit it.  You do just enough to show that you didn't give a shit.  We walk to the camera. 
[03:47:00]  Just enough.  Turn it off.  Turn it back on with a different shot.  Spike Lee made a movie called Get on the Bus about all the guys, black guys going to the  Million Man March.  It's about as simple a movie as you could ask for.  Cheap, cheap video camera, and it's just single shots of dialogues.  It's fucking great, because it's low in scope, and it's not trying to do much.  Right.  It's just some dialogue, and there's no lighting, and some scenes are hard to look at, because  they're so dark.  I was on a bus that went to the Million Man March.  So that must mean this movie's good, because you took a bus once. 
[03:47:30]  But he cared about the movie.  I went to the Million Man March on a bus.  Louie was making a great.  Okay, so then you're right.  It's a good movie.  You're right.  It's a good movie.  Your point being?  The point is that there are many, many movies that do what he says he's doing, which is  let's do away with editing.  Let's say editing is a pretense.  Editing is a trick.  Let's take the school, the tricks out.  You know, let's not have, a lot of people do that.  That's not what this is. 
[03:48:00]  The caring.  The caring about it.  Let's take that out.  This is just no effort.  The effort.  Let's just remove any effort and work that goes behind it.  The dogma people that you just mentioned.  Exactly.  And it's even more offensive that you have the education and know better.  The dogma people.  Because sometimes you see a movie like Out of the Mouth of Babes, you know, you see a movie  made by some people who didn't know what the fuck they were doing, and there's a beauty  to looking at it because of how tragically fucked up it was because they didn't know how to  do it.  That's even better.  See, that I thought.  This isn't even that. 
[03:48:30]  I thought I was going to get a little of that when I watched this.  I was going like, wow, maybe this will be fucked up enough where it's hysterical.  But it just was fucked up.  And it went on and on.  Steve.  Wow.  I think he's reming.  Poor guy.  I love how Jimmy jumps when you wake him up.  He's my right-hand man right now.  I'm just doing this.  It's just like, I don't want to wreck the movie, man.  You're doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing when you watch this movie. 
[03:49:00]  Jimmy, I just touched your lips twice with my hand.  You didn't do it.  Did you?  I was in his tiny hole, too.  Gap in consciousness seems to be with you.  I need a little bit of sugar.  I'm a piece of a knife.  Louie, and I.  This guy can't even defend you ironically without falling asleep.  Truthfully, you're busting my balls.  Truthfully, you're busting my balls.  You're right.  You're not really giving me the benefit of that.  Absolutely.  It's like if you walked in out of the rain into a theater and saw this movie.  I go back out into the rain.  Jesus honest.  If it was raining AIDS, I'd go back out and open my mouth. 
[03:49:30]  I'd look up at it like a turkey and drown in AIDS rain.  After watching three frames of this shit, I'd run back out into the acid rain and let  it eat my body.  That's busting balls.  I'm sorry.  Thank God Louie was here for this today.  We didn't know how to handle this horse shit.  Paolo, I think we're going to wrap up.  Yes, sir.  Paolo, where can people get the movie? 
[03:50:00]  GapTheMovie.com.  I need you to buy this movie because my life is fucked up.  There's a Ron Fez.  Not because it's a good movie.  No.  It is.  Exactly what Steven Spielberg and the rest of them say.  Time will prove you all wrong.  Please buy this movie because I need to pay bills.  Except, of course, by one supporter.  But I'm just saying.  I'll give you $100 right now if you promise never to do this again.  I'll take $145,000 right now.  Again, GapTheMovie.com.  Maybe I can't.  Ron Fez is the promo code. 
[03:50:30]  I do thank you for the opportunity.  Yeah, I feel that if enough people buy this movie, there will be a swell, a groundswell  movement from this.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I mean, we're both trying to do grassroots effort is what you need.  Exactly.  You know, this is how a lot of the movement started.  They started small.  Like, you know, Hitler back in the 30s.  Right.  You've got to take the bad with the good.  Right.  Again, bad analogy.  Hitler was, love or hate him, that man could work a beer hall. 
[03:51:00]  He knew what he was doing.  Yes.  I haven't had some passion.  He designed his own clothes.  I mean, the guy was a fucking, he had a knack.  I haven't gotten.  He did have a passion for what he did.  He knew what he was good at.  He knew what he wasn't good at.  I haven't gotten to the beer school, uh, beer hall, uh, stage of the marketing.  No, you know, you had it.  Just a World War I Hitler.  All right.  With a funny hat.  So you're going to do something.  You're going to stick around and do a run of Fez today.  Yes, sir.  So hopefully, I can't wait to go back to doing stunts for run of Fez. 
[03:51:30]  Thank you, sir.  And, um, let's go around the room and get the fuck out of here.  Um, by the way, oh no, he farted again.  Or is that just the stench coming off of the movie?  Smell-O-Vision.  They finally perfected it.  First, let me throw DirecTV in.  We got a few plugs.  Uh, the, the, the horseshit review for Gap was brought to you by DirecTV.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  DirecTV.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  Paulo, uh, I don't know what to tell you, but it was good radio. 
[03:52:00]  I can tell you that much.  Well, I, I appreciate it, and believe me, the movement, uh, this will be the, the, the,  the, the.  There's gonna be no more.  Day one.  This is day one.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's a great movie.  Um.  I think your glacier's gonna move faster than your movement.  I think.  For this movie.  It starts small, and then mushrooms.  Yeah.  And then snowballs.  Sure.  Okay.  Right.  Uh, what do we got, Jimmy?  Well, Louie's gonna get Caroline's tomorrow night.  He's doing a benefit for his school, but it's just Louie doing his act. 
[03:52:30]  I'm also in March 14th at the Orpheum.  Yeah.  And I have, um.  Austin.  I'm doing a show with Artie Lang in, uh, February 21st, uh, at Tower Theater in Philadelphia.  Tickets go on sale this Friday morning, uh, at, uh, I guess livenation.com or whatever.  Take it, master.  Cool.  Well, because we're leaving, we gotta do a Pro Flowers read.  Oh!  We like Pro Flowers.  It's gonna just sound a little weird just shoving it in here, but.  Hey!  What the hell?  It's not even a read.  We're just bringing it up.
