<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show opened with a fiery debate about Club Soda Kenny, a New Jersey police sergeant and stand-up comedian whose jokes about rape, pedophilia, and bestiality were anonymously reported, potentially costing him his job and pension.  The hosts vehemently defended Kenny's right to free speech, sparking a lengthy discussion with numerous callers weighing in on the conflict between freedom of expression and the conduct expected of a police officer.  Listeners also called to discuss the show's popularity and their investment in XM stock based on its success.  One caller even claimed Howard Stern told him to call and apologize, adding a bizarre twist to the already contentious situation.  Kenny's past association with Andrew Dice Clay was also mentioned.

The show then shifted to a furious confrontation with Earl, a producer from the Ron and Fez show, who had accidentally erased the Opie and Anthony Grammy recordings by changing the television channel in their office the previous night.  This resulted in a lengthy, expletive-filled argument involving other staff members, ending with Earl's apology.  Other news items discussed included a New York City clerical worker fired for playing Solitaire, a 45-year-old therapist who had sex with a 17-year-old boy (with the teen showing little distress), and a Florida sheriff's deputy fired for using his dashcam to film women in bikinis.  The upcoming Grammy Awards, the loss of their recordings, and the impending launch of Oprah Winfrey's XM radio channel were also discussed, contrasting the press releases for both shows.  

Sean Hannity called in, discussing his busy schedule, political views (mentioning a recent interview with Bob Grant and his switch from Republican to Conservative registration), and the McCain-Feingold campaign finance laws.  Comedian Judah Friedlander made a brief in-studio appearance, promoting *Date Movie*.  Bubba the Love Sponge's comments about Opie and Anthony were also mentioned. The hosts also touched upon libertarianism, referencing Reaganâ€™s tax cuts and their economic effects.


A significant portion of the show featured in-studio guest Laura Korn, a sex expert and author of "101 Nights of Great Sex," along with Judah Friedlander.  The conversation veered into explicit territory, with graphic descriptions of sexual acts and techniques from Korn's book, including a game involving sealed envelopes with instructions.  Jimmy, a recurring character or co-host, contributed numerous personal sexual anecdotes, often using offensive language.  The hosts, Korn, and Friedlander engaged in detailed and explicit discussions of sex, preferences, and positions, using vulgar language and sexual innuendo throughout. Lee Abrams also called in to discuss the Grammy Awards, but the conversation quickly returned to sexually explicit topics.  The show concluded with further discussion of Club Soda Kenny, Oprah's XM channel, and a listener recounting a personal experience with one of Korn's sexual techniques.  The entire show maintained a highly informal and vulgar tone, punctuated by numerous expletives and comedic interjections.

That was me  Oh  Very good 
[00:09:00]  This is Tom  He wrote a letter to Entertainment Weekly  Defending the fine Opie and Anthony show  Oh, hey man  And we talked about it yesterday, actually  For like a half hour  And I wanted to thank the past  I got some really nice emails  Well, we told them to be kind  Yeah, they were  It was the Stern fans that were a little unkind  Tough shit  They're frustrated  Because they know we're speaking the truth over here  Right  You know, and Opie, you hit the nail right on the head  How can you relate to a guy who makes that much money? 
[00:09:30]  What relevance does this guy have to anybody who's listening to him?  Our goal is to make just as much money and then we'll fade away  Yeah  But until then, enjoy the passion that we still have  Yeah, but you're not forgetting your roots, you know?  Want to make enough money so we can be hypocrites?  Yeah, exactly  My roots, I still rent, I don't own a place  Yeah  I just opened up a restaurant with my two brothers in Huntington  You know, I got bills to pay  Absolutely  We better get more successful 
[00:10:00]  You know, I work for a living  You know, I don't have every Friday off  Right  And a half billion dollar contract  Right  It just doesn't happen for most people  Well, he hasn't made that announcement yet  Because he knows his fans are going to rip him apart  But Howard's going to work only four days a week eventually  You know  Probably sooner than later, by the way  But I want to thank you, dude  The latest issue of Entertainment Weekly in the mail section  I've got to cut you off because Jimmy is losing his mind over there  Yeah  All right  We've got to get down to some business  Maybe we'll have you on the show a little later 
[00:10:30]  But thank you  Thank you  I know the pests are out there fighting battles that we don't even know about  They come to our attention every once in a while  And Tom wrote this letter to Entertainment Weekly  They printed it and it makes us look really, really good  Thanks, Tom  Thank you, Tom  Thanks, guys  All right  Bye  Let's go to John in Jersey  John, what's up?  Hello  Hey, John  Hey, what's up?  I was on the way to work this morning listening to AM News  And they talked about a New Jersey cop that has a second life as a comic in New York City 
[00:11:00]  That's under fire by his boss  He might lose his job  And he goes by the name of Club Soda Kenny in New York in the comic scene  Yeah, yeah  Club Soda Kenny is in the paper today  Sounds like so, Jay  And now it's in, what, now the radio, the news stations are talking about it down there in Jersey?  Yeah, WABC in New York, the AMC  Oh, boy  Wait, ABC in New York's talking about it?  Oh, boy, this story has some legs  Oh, boy  That's better for him  This story has legs 
[00:11:30]  Strap in, kids  All right, thanks, John  We'll get into it right now  That's why Jimmy is beyond pissed  He's reading the article right now  It's unbelievable, right?  It's really a freedom of speech issue  It's sickening  Yeah, really, of course it is  It's like one of those textbook freedom of speech issues  Kenny went on and did some stand-up at a cringe humor show  Oddly enough, there's a cringe humor show tonight  Oh  And he just did it because he just loves it, I guess 
[00:12:00]  And someone, probably some copy went after  Just someone who doesn't like him  Sent an anonymous copy of the videotape of his act to his superiors  Yeah  And they suspended him because of what he said  And it's a reprehensible act that he does  Of course it is, as an act, sure  But that's an act  It's him playing a character on stage  That isn't him, that isn't the person he is when he's on the job 
[00:12:30]  That's why people don't  They've gotten so politically correct that they put the two together  If you play a character, a role  And it's an offensive role you're playing  And then you have a job  Why should the two be connected?  Well, it's going to be an interesting story, to say the least  I don't think, to be honest with you, I don't know the details  But I don't think he was getting paid, which I think is better  I don't think he was getting paid, because he's not moonlighting 
[00:13:00]  He was just doing it, I think he just loves to do it  Yeah  And look what the police chief said  Without question, he has no authorization under policy to do this as employment  Police Chief James Abbott said  We would never allow anybody to make racial jokes or anything like that  Allow, well, I could see if he was, you know, on the job  And in front of people  Representing the police department  And saying the things he says  That's one thing  Then the guy could say  That that's a problem 
[00:13:30]  When you're off duty  And you're doing stand-up comedy  That's a freedom of speech issue  He is doing it on his own time  And you can pretty much say whatever you want in this country  Especially in that context  As stand-up comedy  How many cops drink  Or beat their wives  Or do all this other shit to blow off steam  Because it's a brutal job  And what he does is he lifts weights  And he does stand-up  He doesn't drink  He doesn't do anything 
[00:14:00]  Any type of substances  Anything like that  This is how he blows off steam  A major family man  A major family man  This makes me want to fucking throw up  22 year veteran  Well, we should just read this whole thing  Because there's so much in this  Yeah, I agree  In this  And there's a lot to comment about  He's one of our bestest pals  Yes, we love Kenny  Club Soda Kenny has helped us out like you wouldn't believe  And we're going to do all we can to help him out  And he's fucking Larry law-abiding citizen  Dude, that's what really annoys me about this 
[00:14:30]  Is the guy does nothing illegal  Nothing  And it's scary because he's very close to  You know, retiring and getting his pension and stuff  And, you know, it's going to be interesting  As we move forward from here  But it's the Star-Ledger in New Jersey  By the way, the Star-Ledger called all of us  Called Ben  I mean, they're trying to get comments from us  Go fuck yourselves  Go fuck yourselves  Oh, we're just writing a story  We're on your side  Shut up  Yeah, sure  No, you don't  A stand-up gig could cost West Orange 
[00:15:00]  Cop his job  Club Soda Kenny  Routine gets sergeant suspended without pay  Around West Orange  John Fetter is known as a no-nonsense police sergeant  A 22-year veteran with an $88,000 salary  And a plum assignment in the department's internal affairs division  But on the local comedy circuit  The towering cop goes by another name  Club Soda Kenny  A crass stand-up comic whose routine pokes fun at such taboo topics  As rape, pedophilia, and bestiality  The act has landed Club Soda Kenny 
[00:15:30]  On the popular Opie and Anthony radio program  And gotten him gigs at top New York comedy clubs  Wrong!  Jonathan Cassiano  Wrong!  You're a horrible reporter  You're a horrible writer  That you don't know shit  He did do it  He did get it wrong  It hasn't landed him spots at the top  A couple things  Club Soda Kenny's been our friend for years  Yeah  And it wasn't because of his act  He's just a friend of the show  Helps out whenever he can  He helps us as a bodyguard 
[00:16:00]  And a personal assistant  And all this fine stuff  And he's so happy to start doing stand-up comedy  It wasn't his act that brought attention from us  You ass  For years, Sergeant Fetter and Club Soda Kenny have coexisted peacefully  But this week, the two personas collided  When several West Orange officials were anonymously mailed  The CD of Fetter's act  An eight-minute profanity-laced tirade  Performed at a December comedy show in Manhattan 
[00:16:30]  And later posted online  Fetter does not wear his uniform  Or identify himself as a police officer in the act  Right  The routine in which Club Soda Kenny jokes about raping a bride at knife point  And molesting his own five-year-old son  Has at least temporarily cost Fetter his gun, badge, and paycheck  That's where we've gone in this society  A guy doing a stand-up comedy routine  Is now possibly going to lose his job and his pension  Because what he joked about is politically incorrect  Right  It's almost my 
[00:17:00]  This is like a bad parody  Of what an asinine society would do to a guy  For doing unpopular jokes  It's sickening  Right  And he's less than a year away from getting his pension  Yeah  That's what makes this whole thing a little scary  He was suspended without pay Monday  Pending an investigation into his act  West Orange officials said  Though no administrative charges have been filed  The 48-year-old Fetter  Could be charged with conduct  Unbecoming of an officer  An administrative offense  That could strip Fetter of his job  And possibly even his pension 
[00:17:30]  Officials said  Township officials would not comment on the investigation  Because it is an internal personal matter  However, they said that if Fetter was paid for his performance  It would be a violation of the department's policy  That prohibits officers from moonlighting  Without departmental approval  Without question, he has no authorization on a policy  To do this as employment  Police Chief James Abbott said  We would never allow anybody to make racial jokes  Or anything like that  Has James Abbott ever talked to cops? 
[00:18:00]  I mean, they have a very, very  I don't think any cop would deny that  In general, there's a gallows humor  It's a brutal job  You're a fucking target  They have a really, really  Brutal sense of humor  It's a survival mechanism  And so he takes it onto a stage  And this guy, it's just  I wish I could express better  How irritating this is  Well, I think you will  As we move forward here  When visited at his home in Springfield yesterday  Fetter declined to comment 
[00:18:30]  This fucking reporter was hanging outside  Kenny's place for a couple days straight  The suspension places West Orange  Squarely inside a legal gray area  Pitting First Amendment advocates  Against defenders of decency  Here we go again, ladies and gentlemen  Mayor John McKeon said  The town has zero tolerance  For any law enforcement officer  Or other township employee  That isn't racially sensitive  Or isn't sensitive to victims  Of criminal activity  Sensitive  That's  Sensitive  That's not what 
[00:19:00]  They're making it sound like  Stan's comedy and freedom of speech is about  They're making it sound like  He was on the job  In uniform  And in the middle of  Arresting some perp  He's telling all these crazy jokes  Which would be inappropriate  Of course  That's the difference  This was on his own time  Yeah  He wasn't getting paid  No  In a club  But Frank Askin  Director of the  Constitutional litigation clinic  At Rutgers Law School  In Newark  Said the U.S. Constitution  Should protect Federer  From repercussions at work 
[00:19:30]  No matter how outlandish  His routine  If he's off duty  The First Amendment  Protects him  And they can't punish him  By taking his job away  For exercising his right  To free speech  Askin said  The courts have upheld  That view in the past  And then it goes on  To another case  In 1985  The Fourth Circuit  Court of Appeals  Ruled that the  Baltimore Police Department  Could not punish an officer  For performing  A blackface routine  While off duty  Even though the performance  Sparked outrage  And demonstrations  Throughout the city  Page two 
[00:20:00]  However  Alan Goobel  Assistant Director  Of the New Jersey  Coalition  Alana  That's a chick  Huh?  I'm sorry  However  Alana Goobel  Assistant Director  Of the New Jersey  Coalition Against Sexual Assault  Said police departments  Should not tolerate  Officers who joke about rape  Regardless of their right  To speak freely  I bet she looks like  An Alan though  I'm sure she's awful  But do you see  How frightening that is?  The word right here  Regardless of their right  No  Stupid  Not regardless of their right  No  You can't brush that off 
[00:20:30]  Like yeah  They have freedom of speech  But not about this subject  They don't  Yeah regardless of their right  That's the right  In that sentence  Lies the problem  With every special interest group  In this country  Yeah  Every special interest group  Yeah you have a freedom of speech  And here's the asterisk  As long as it goes  Hand in hand  With what I consider  Decent in my ideology  Yeah  No stupid  He has the right to do it  On his own time  In a comedy club setting  It's a bunch of adults  There were no kids there  He wasn't doing it in public  As far as like 
[00:21:00]  You know  In the middle of a mall  People have a complete lack  Of understanding  About the freedom of speech  And what it is  Of course they do  They absolutely  There are too many people  Out there that believe  It's the freedom of speech  As long as it doesn't  Offend me  Or someone else  Or a group  No  It's freedom of speech  To offend people  You're allowed  If you're offended by it  That doesn't mean  They don't have the right  To say it  But a lot of people  Really think  That it's illegal  Or something  To say things 
[00:21:30]  That are offensive  To certain groups  Or people  No it's not  It's what the whole thing  Is based on  Idiot  And look  She's the director  Of a rape  Crisis center  I mean obviously  They're going to take rape  Really  Like you can't joke  I understand all that  But I want to know  How  If he was an actor  And he played a rapist  Would they have gone after him  No  They wouldn't have  It's just a politically correct response  And she goes on  In the next sentence  The coalition thinks  It was absolutely  An appropriate decision 
[00:22:00]  By this officer's superiors  No no no  The coalition thinks  It was absolutely  Inappropriate  Inappropriate  I thought you said inappropriate  Oh no no  Inappropriate  Inappropriate decision  They agree  Yeah of course  By this officer's superiors  Goble said  Rape isn't a joke  I would love to get Alana  On the show  To talk about free speech  I would love to get her  On the phone right now  Regardless of their  Rights to speak freely  No  I understand  Her and her group  Very very sensitive  To any jokes or humor 
[00:22:30]  Dark humor  Gallows humor  About rape  We understand that  She isn't going to like it  She's going to want  You know  Kenny thrown off  And that's the end of it  But she doesn't understand  That there is a right  To say those things  It's a legal right  You're  It's an entitlement  It's a right  Of the constitution  To talk about it  You will be offended  By it  You might even sit there  And curl up in the fetal position 
[00:23:00]  And cry in the shower again  When you hear it  But it's allowed  You can do that  In this country  Without suffering  Any kind of  Repercussions like this  You know  They said that  When John Wayne Gacy's  Victims were being  Carted out  By the cops  They were digging up bodies  I read an account on it  They said the cops  Were joking around  As they're pulling bodies out  It's not that they think  That it's funny  It's because that's  A gallows humor  That's what you do  When you're in that kind of a job  It's the way you survive  You're giving 
[00:23:30]  Soldiers do  That's how you cope  You cope  I mean look  He was in internal affairs  But he spent how many years  Pulling guys over  And chasing down suspects  It's a brutal job man  And for a cop  To get called out  Doing something like that  In his private life  Not for money  But just as a venting thing  Or for whatever reason  He does it  His private life  It's frightening  It's really frightening  He's not acting out  The things he's talking about  On a stage  You idiots  It's not like he's committing  These crimes  That he talks about on stage 
[00:24:00]  He's talking about it  In the context  Of a comedy act  At a club  Because what would happen  If that was a speech  He was giving  And he had  Let's say he  Not that he can't agree  With rape in a speech  I mean that was sociopathic  But let's say  It was a serious speech  Where he just had  Very politically incorrect views  Right  And it was off his own time  I mean are they going to fire him  Or wreck his pension  Because he had views  That didn't agree  I think the Jersey trooper  That got in trouble  For saying that blacks 
[00:24:30]  Got arrested more  Because they committed  More of the crimes  Whitman of course crucified him  Yeah  I think he probably  Said it on duty  And got fired  But the key here  It was in a comedy club  People are going to a comedy club  To hear some crazy shit  Some crazy stuff  It's completely in the proper context  To be saying those awful things  No matter who you are  I feel really bad for Kenny  He's freaking out  We've been talking to him  Every day  This thing has been  Developing for a few days now  And man 
[00:25:00]  Kenny  I know you listen every day  You gotta hang in there  Just hang in there  We'll get through this  Continuing with the article  And he is hanging in there  And he is  He's gonna be alright  Local comics and booking agents  Said Federer entered the comedy world  Almost 20 years ago  When he befriended  Up and coming shock comic  Andrew Dice Clay  At Rascals Comedy Club  Which has since moved  From West Orange to Montclair  Clay offered Federer a job  On a security team  And would often incorporate him  Into his act  When Clay hit his peak 
[00:25:30]  In the late 80's  Federer took a leave of absence  From the police department  To tour with him  Said Tony Camacho  A New York agent  Who used to book Clay  For Rascals  That's where he got his name  Club Soda Kenny  From Dice saying  Get me a Club Soda Kenny  Camacho said  He was like a sounding board  For Dice  He was like a sounding board  For Dice  While he was on stage  When Clay stopped touring  Federer turned to the police force  But his stage name  Still carried weight  On the comedy circuit  He has a certain reputation  As a funny tough guy character  You know  The whole Dice entourage 
[00:26:00]  Kind of thing  Said Ed Cavanaugh  The entertainment director  At Rascals  That reputation  Has landed Club Soda Kenny  Regular features  On Opie and Anthony  Oh my god  A program on XM  Satellite Radio  Known for its lowball humor  And adolescent pranks  He's also appeared  In the hidden camera DVD  Meet the Creeps  The CD sent to  West Orange officials  Was from a December 8th  Performance at the  Laugh Factory Comedy Club  In Times Square  For 8 minutes  Club Soda Kenny  Rants about everything  From pistol whipping  His wife 
[00:26:30]  To having sex  With his dog  The segment later  Was posted online  With a picture of Federer  And a brief description  Of his act  Both have since  Been taken off  www.cringehumor.net  Though the site  Still offers  An Opie and Anthony  Segment featuring  Audio and photos  Of Federer  Bob Levy  A South Jersey comic  Who performed with Federer  About a year ago  At Caroline's  Comedy Club  In Manhattan  Said Club Soda Kenny  Is more of a cult character  Than an aspiring comic  He admitted Federer's act  Was pushing it a little  But said comedy routines  Do not always reflect  A person's true feelings 
[00:27:00]  If it doesn't affect  Your day job  What does it mean?  It doesn't mean anything  It's like telling someone  Who's a cop  You can't go out  And sing karaoke  You know what  If Levy said that  That's a genius point  What if it was a karaoke song  With offensive lyrics in it?  Yeah  What if it was a karaoke song  That for whatever reason  Offended people's sensibilities  Or ideologies  Would that be illegal  Or would that be a problem  For him as far as  The department's concerned?  Mm-hmm  Oh that is sickening  So  This story 
[00:27:30]  This story has  Lots and lots of legs  That's for sure  Let's go to Dave  On Long Island  Dave what's up?  Yo  The biggest thing  They're shooting for  Is they see his pensions  Coming up  And they're gonna save  That much friggin money  Just by offering this guy  I don't know man  I'm not gonna say  It's a money issue  I think it's more  Of a politically correct  I'm sure it's politically driven  But I mean  Think of how much  His pension's gonna weigh out to be  The police chief's not thinking  Of that dude  You know  They nail guys  With drug stuff 
[00:28:00]  You know  They'll double test them  For you know  Drug testing and stuff  Just to off the pension  And send a guy on his way  Just you know  They don't give a shit about him  I know they don't  But drug testing  Or whatever is one thing  But a guy doing  I don't think anybody's  Gonna stand up comedy  I just don't think  They're going after his pension  I think this is a PC issue  They saw this as being  Embarrassing to the department  And they're just gonna  Investigate it  They're gonna find nothing  Because he didn't do anything wrong  Well club store to Kenny  He's got a great case  On his hands  He does  That's for sure  I don't know what's gonna happen  I have  You know  Cause Kenny's not giving me 
[00:28:30]  The details  But you know  I'm sure he's gonna fight this  All the way  Let's see what the ACLU does  All they do is  Hold on dude  All they do is defend people  Who are barbarians  In their behavior  Yeah  Let's see if the ACLU  Steps up  And defends a guy's right  To free speech  They're too busy defending  Every Muslim  That wants to kill Americans  That's who they're  Defending nowadays  How about Ron Cooby  I mean let's see if he  Pipes up and says  Anything about it  I mean he's a big  Defender of people's right  To say what they want  Jimmy of all people 
[00:29:00]  You should know  Since when did they  Start taking fucking  Comics seriously  Well dude they've always  Done it  They've always done it  Look Lenny Bruce  Lenny Bruce  Was arrested prior  Oh god shit  Dice  The women's movement  Ruined Dice's career  That's why  They paid him off  For three films  And the gay guys  Yeah the special interest  Groups of course  Special interest groups  Because they were  Too scared to go after  Black guys  Saying  Colin raised his point  Actually it was a  Brilliant point  That when Dice was  Doing what he was doing  They couldn't go after  Rappers  Because again  White special interest  Groups will never  Go after groups like that 
[00:29:30]  Because it's misconstrued  As racist  Right  So they went after  Who they thought was safe  Which was a shock  Shock comic  Or a shock value comic  They would never go after  Look at Dice's band  From MTV  For saying dirty words  Right  Meanwhile 50 Cent  Is on there  Calling other people  A punk motherfucker  And threatening to shoot  Them and they have to  Beep  But you know what  They're never going to  Ban 50 Cent  Or any rapper  Snoop Dogg is a gang member  He was a gang member  And I know now he's not  And everybody loves him  And he's great  But you know what  Why has his past behavior  Not been judged  Why is he not been  Bad from MTV  A he's black  And B he's a musician 
[00:30:00]  So you can do  Whatever you want  But if you're a comic  You're fucking  They're going to come after you  Yeah they've been  Crucifying comics forever  Like Jimmy said  I mean I just saw  The Lenny Bruce play  And they wrecked  Lenny Bruce's career  Yeah  They wrecked his career  They ruined him  He got arrested  For saying cocksucker  And it never got better  From that day on  Two handfuls  It got to a point  Where he was broke  And he couldn't  No one was going to  Hire him across America  Not one club would hire him  Only because they were  Afraid to get arrested  Or yanked out  And they were going to  Lose money  Or their club 
[00:30:30]  And they were going to  Get shut down  Either way  It boils down to  Two handfuls  Of irrelevant douchebags  Deciding what we can  And can't do  Every fucking day  Well you know what  This is an issue  Right here  This seems to be an issue  Where the far right  And the far left  Come handed  I mean the far right  Let's be honest  Has been much worse  For free speech  I mean as much as  I trash liberals  It's been the conservatives  With this family values  Shit that have been  The major problem  But then you look  At somebody in a far left  Or they always  They come out  And well  He shouldn't say that  Because it's dangerous  Free speech  It's hate speech 
[00:31:00]  That's how the left  Will do it  The right will say  It's family values  Endangerment  And the left  Will come out  And say it's hate speech  Everyone has their own  Reason as to why  You can't say  What they don't want you  To say  Alright fellas  I got a boat man  I got shit to do at work  Have a good one  Alright thanks  Let's go to Michelle  In New York  Michelle  You guys came to XM  And I've been a fan  Of Kenny's  And I didn't have  Any idea he was a cop  I mean it just blows my mind  He's never used that  As part of his spot 
[00:31:30]  On the show  Never  Never  Never  Never  I mean I'm just in shock  I did not even know  He was a cop  He doesn't talk about it  He doesn't come on  You know  Even in his personal life  I've hung out with him  He doesn't try  He doesn't tell people  I'm a cop  Let me do this  The guy is like  It's so annoying  Because I know him  And despite the act  Having barbaric lines in it  He's the most law-abiding guy  I know  And then to see him  Vilified for some dumb shit  He said on stage  Under the context  Of being a comic  With adults  It's frightening 
[00:32:00]  That that can happen today  It is  You know  I heard his spot there  In December  When he did it at the club  And it is real cringe humor  But how does that have  Anything to do  With the fact  That he's a police officer  It absolutely doesn't  You're right  It has nothing to do with it  Nothing  I just can't even believe  That this would even  Have anything to do  With his job  Could affect his pension  Blows my mind  Yeah it shouldn't  At all  Blows my mind  Well again  Thanks  Well let's get some people in  They're calling from 
[00:32:30]  All over the country  Robert Missouri  What's up  Hey guys  Hey  I just want to say  You're awesome  This is the reason why  Switch to XM  Politically correct  It's just getting out of hand  I'd pay 50 bucks a month  To listen to you guys  That's all  Punch it out  Why sir  They're overcharging you  312 something I think  No filter Paul  Hey good morning guys  Good morning  Well I've been on hold  For like 20 minutes  Just to plug the show  But I guess I don't need to now  For tonight's show 
[00:33:00]  With Jim Norton  And Bill Burr  And I just wanted to give out  The phone number  For anyone who wanted to go  If that's okay  It's 212-586  Don what's going on  Hey what's going on  You have horrendous timing  No filter Paul  We'll plug the  Cringe Humor show  A little later  Don what's up  Oh I just wanted to say  Yeah I totally agree  With you guys  Y'all are right on the point  But some same stuff  Happens to some  Close friends of mine  They'd be working  For Budweiser 
[00:33:30]  And they go into a bar  At night  And they're not on duty  They're not in their uniform  They're not  And they drink a  Courage beer  Their boss walks in  And fires their ass  And he says  And I said  What?  That's bullshit  And he said  Well it's ethical  I'm not  You know  I'm not doing  I'm not supporting  My company  Or whatever  Yeah I did hear about that  You know  I don't know  That's not enough  It's a freedom of speech  Or whatever it is  Yeah  You know  I guess it ties in somehow  Yeah but you know  It sucks  I totally agree with you guys  But I mean 
[00:34:00]  I don't know  If it starts falling  Under that ethical BS  Or what  But I just thought  I'd give y'all  Play devil's advocate here  And give you a different view  Maybe  Well they are kind of creepy  I mean there's a lot of companies  Now that won't hire you  If you smoke  Which they say is health insurance reasons  Or you know whatever  But it's amazing how they really are creeping  You know  I mean I guess they've always been in your personal business  But it's like they still refuse to get out of it  Exactly  People still refuse to get out of your business  Exactly  Exactly Jimmy  I totally agree with you  And how long has Kenny been doing comedy now?  I honestly don't know  I don't  When I first met him  We were like  I knew him with Dice 
[00:34:30]  I never knew he had done stand up or tried  I think it was more of like a thing he would do occasionally  When the time was right  When he would just go up  You know what I mean?  I don't think it was ever something he said I'm going to do  I know he doesn't want to do it professionally  He loves what he does  He's a cop  He loves being a cop  He doesn't want to leave that and do stand up professionally  It's like a hobby  Alright let's go to Dugout Doug  Doug what's up today?  What's going on guys?  Good morning  And to the guy three calls ago  You can email an extra $40 to dugoutdoug at gmail.com  If you want to pay $50 a month  But the unfortunate problem is with Kenny 
[00:35:00]  And I am a huge Club Soda Kenny fan  So don't get me wrong here  I'm not taking you guys on  But what they're going to do is they're going to use the  Taking a police officer  And holding him to a higher standard routine  And they're going to go after him with that  Which is really unfortunate  Because they take the badge and the duty  From the second you walk into an academy  Well Doug let me cut you off and ask you a question  I know what you're saying about  They have to like give you a higher standard of behavior and stuff 
[00:35:30]  But in a freedom of speech argument  Like when it comes down to like a legal argument like that  What can they do?  Well the problem is you're not talking legal  You're talking what a police department is going to do  With Kenny's career right now  And what they're going to do is they're going to look at it  From an ethical standpoint  Almost as if  You know  You're held to a higher standard  If you have the badge 
[00:36:00]  Somewhere  In that paperwork  That he signed when he got that job  They can now go back and find something  And whether or not  He  Is going to get shit for what he's actually doing here  Which as you're saying  And I agree with  Is legally nothing  He's not breaking any laws by doing what he's doing  But they're going to go back  And they're going to look for something now  To ride his ass on  You're saying like a non-legal clause in his contract 
[00:36:30]  Like they're not going after him legally  They're just saying as far as this job is concerned  We can fire you for behaving this way  Not necessarily for behaving that way  I don't know if they can actually fire him for this  As far as the situation is concerned  Who knows  They can't fire him for being a stand-up comic  Unless they're going to go to  What you mentioned earlier  I'm sorry  What the article mentioned earlier  As far as working part-time  Without permission of the department  They can turn around and fire him for that 
[00:37:00]  But he wasn't working  So that's the beauty of it  And I would  If Patrick  First of all  I'm doing that show tonight  If I found out Patrick was paying Club Soda Kenny  And not me  I'd fucking set his house on fire  And another beautiful thing is too  Which Kenny definitely has going for him  I've listened to every second of this show  Since you guys have been on XM  No idea until I saw that article this morning  That Kenny was a cop  Oh, he kept it separate  He always kept it separate  Yeah, everybody  None of us said anything  A good thing he has going for him 
[00:37:30]  As far as this whole situation is concerned  Is that he wasn't using that position  To gain notoriety  Or wasn't using the position in his act  Right, right  To ridicule a police department  Or anything like that  All right, Doug  I've got to move on  Thanks, buddy  Everybody wants to in here  Debbie in the area  And he's right, too  Debbie  Hey, how you doing, guys?  You're a cop?  Yes, I am  Hey, Jimmy  It's Debbie  Oh, hey, Debbie  How are you?  Good  You know  Doug's right on the fact that  You know  When you become a cop  There's orders 
[00:38:00]  And you're supposed to know the orders  Inside and out  Whether you read them or not  And you have to follow them  In those orders  Is things  Unbecoming of a police officer  Which you can lose your job  Your pension  And everything for  But  How often is  Unbecoming of a police officer  Challenged legally  As a freedom of speech issue?  Because, like, again  A lot of times  They said the courts  Have upheld the cops' right  To do a certain thing  In their private time  You know  Conduct on becoming a police officer 
[00:38:30]  Could be  When you're dressed as a cop  When you're on duty  Say  Seeing a pregnant woman  And, I mean  Saying something about  Punching her  Or if you see a black guy  Saying something racist  Technically, I don't think  That's illegal  But that, to me  Is conduct on becoming  A police officer  Right  What the order says  Is on and off duty  All those orders  Say on and off duty  So now it will come down to  Is this  Unbecoming of a police officer  Or is it not?  Like, what's more important?  Will that clause in his contract  Or his right  To speak freely 
[00:39:00]  Which will weigh heavier  And I think the freedom of speech issue will  Because he wasn't doing it as a cop  And he wasn't being paid to do it  I think the freedom of speech issue  Will weigh heavier  They're probably going to offer him  Some sort of deal  But he's probably going to  Lose his job  It's just the way that  This job is  This job stinks  And if somebody has it out for you  They're going to throw you under the bus  And they're going to take  Everything from you  If they can  I will say  I hope you're wrong  I mean, I  I don't know  Especially if there's a lot of people  Talking about it  I'm glad actually 
[00:39:30]  That Star-Ledger article  Was written  For Kenny's sake  Because now they can't just do it  And brush him under the rug  And go beat it  I would love to know  Who was the coward  That anonymously  Mailed this in too  Of course  What do you expect  Of course  Unbelievable  It might be a cop that hates him  Or it could just be  A person who was offended by it  And who recognized him from West  It could be anything  It could be anything  It could be somebody  That just happened to have heard it  Or saw it on the internet  That he arrested in the past  Called the chief  And was like  Hey, you know  He did this, this, and this  That happens to us  All the time  I know there's no real 
[00:40:00]  Friends in the  When you're with the IAD too  No  Yes, absolutely not  There are a couple of people  That probably would like  To see you  Taken down a couple of natches  Right  Alright, Debbie  We're going to move on  Let's go to Sarge in Jersey  Sarge  Hey, what's up guys  What's up  Hey, listen man  This is all politics  For Kenny, man  Yep  It's the mayor  If you read the paper  The police department  Didn't comment on it  The mayor did  It's just Jersey politics  Playing at its best  The mayor didn't like  What he did  And he's getting humped 
[00:40:30]  This story has legs, man  He's going to have  He's going to have  A big fight on his hand  But Jimmy, you're right  With the constitutional issues  The Supreme Court  Has already ruled on that  Yeah  We don't give up our rights  When we become a cop  Absolutely not  And again  If he was standing there  In his city police officer uniform  With a badge and a fake gun  On a stand  I mean, to me  That's alright  I can understand  That's conduct  I'm becoming an officer  But he  No one who doesn't know Kenny  Knows he's a cop  He never says it  I didn't even know it until today  What's that?  I didn't even know it until today 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, he doesn't  It's not the way he carries himself  He doesn't run around  I'm a cop  Give me this  Give me that  He's just him  Yeah, New Jersey  If I'm a New Jersey cop  And the politics there  Are horrible  If he needs a good labor lawyer  I got the best  Yeah, well hopefully  There'll be somebody  Or the ACLU  If the ACLU  It's not going to be the ACLU  Why?  Because they're not going to help a cop  No, no, no  Dude, they defend the  I'll say one thing to the ACLU  As much as they annoy me  They've defended the Klan's right to march  They've defended a lot of  Like groups that, believe me  Go completely against their ideology  The ACLU is annoying  But they're not completely obsessed 
[00:41:30]  He needs a specialized attorney  Of labor law  That deals with just police departments  And the rights of police officers  That's the only one  That's going to get him off  Well, Sarge  Hold on the line  Alright  Alright  Let's get some info from Sarge  Let's go to Buffalo  John, what's up?  Hey, it's Sean, man  What's going on, guys?  Hey  Hey, just wanted to say  Bullshit, what happened to Kenny  If he did  Yeah, Jimmy's right  If he's not standing up there  In his police uniform  With a gun  He's allowed to do whatever he wants  Constitutional rights  And I've seen it  And I've seen it around here  In the Buffalo 
[00:42:00]  Syracuse  Niagara Falls area  Not that anyone's gotten  In trouble for it yet  But just the standards  Of the comedy clubs  Because of what these people  Can and can't say anymore  And what they're scared to do  It's bringing it way down  And it sucks  It really does  I just wanted to say  TNA with ONA in Buffalo  Was one of the funniest things  I've ever seen  And thank you  One of the greatest things ever  Those video clips  Still being downloaded  All over the place  It's the best fucking day  Of my life  We'll never be back  Unfortunately  Because of that  I know, man  I wish you guys  Still be  But thank you for coming 
[00:42:30]  Fist her ass  I'm punching out, guys  All right  I think there's some  Warrants out for us  In Buffalo  Yeah  Enough for a loud back  Now, David in Atlanta  What's up?  Hey, guys  I love the show  All right  I just want to say  I think it's pretty obvious  Who it was that ratted on Kenny  Yeah  I think it was Rich Voss  Because he was upset  That Kenny's act  Was so much better than his  Hello  I'm making an anonymous  Phone call  Yeah  That's how they knew  It was somebody  Because he said  Hi, this is Rich Voss 
[00:43:00]  And I'm calling it anonymity  An anonymity  That's funny  Let's go to Rob in New York  Rob  Hey, how are you guys  Doing this morning?  We're doing all right  Our buddy's in trouble  And we're not happy about it  Yeah  I feel really bad for Kenny  Here's what's going on  I'm an English teacher  And I also teach  A little bit of ethics  In the classroom  I just wanted to talk about  The ethics of the situation  Now, legally  They really can't  Don't have a case  Against Kenny  It's all going to come down  To ethics  And whether or not  You know  He violated any ethics 
[00:43:30]  As a cop  Now, he's never mentioned  Being a cop in his act  He's never mentioned  You know  Any kind of that  He even goes under  A different name  So, legally  They have nothing on him  Now, the problem is  That somebody  Brought this attention  To the cops  To his department  Chances are  They probably already  Knew that he was doing this  And so  They have to respond  To a complaint  So, when they get  A complaint like this 
[00:44:00]  And when they have  They have to investigate it  So, they're probably  Going to blow it up  As big as possible  But, if I were Kenny  And Kenny  If you're listening right now  You know  Breathe easy on this  Because this is all  Going to blow over eventually  And what's going to happen  Is they're going to  Eventually  You know  They have to look into it  After they look into it  They're going to find  Pretty much nothing  And they're going to run  Like, you know  A little three-line  Article in the Star-Ledger  And, you know  You'll be alright  Here's what you said  Like about  As far as 
[00:44:30]  What did you say  About being a cop  And, like  Sort of ethics  Like, this is where  The freedom of speech  Comes in  Because if you're  Like, that's like  Saying the ethics  They say he went up  And did a Brian Regan  Type of an act  There would be no issue  So, the behavior  Wasn't unethical  It was just  What he was saying  You understand what I mean  It's like  It's not like  He was behaving inappropriately  No police department  Would say  You couldn't go up there  And do a Brian Regan  Type of an act  For free  They would never  Try to tell you that  So, the fact that 
[00:45:00]  He's doing an  Un-Regan-like act  Is to me the problem  It wasn't  Unethical behavior  It was just unpopular  What he was saying  In the context of something  That's a  Completely allowed thing to do  Now, if he's going up there  And he's saying  You know  Hey, I'm a local  New Jersey cop  And this is my name  That would be  A violation of his ethics  Because he's bringing  The  He's pretty much  Bringing the shield  Into the comedy club  Right  He is representing himself  As a cop  But he's not  You know  He is totally  A different name  And so therefore 
[00:45:30]  It's not a violation  There was  There was a woman  That  A woman cop  She posed nude  In one of the nudie magazines  And they couldn't get her on that  What they got her on  Is that she  Used part of her uniform  During the shoot  Like she had her hat on  Or something else  That goes way back  And they said  It wasn't the fact  That she was nude  It was the fact  That she was  Using part of her uniform  And then  It brought the whole  Cop aspect into it  And Kenny just  Never let on 
[00:46:00]  That he was a cop  Never identified himself  As a cop  When he was on stage  Had a different  Character name  I think that  That really  Is important in this  Right  Yeah  Alright Rob  Thank you  Alright  Brian in San Diego  I'm a cop out here  In San Diego  I'm on the job  Right now  We actually had  An incident  With a guy  Who did  Put some of his  Uniform and badge  And stuff  On a picture  He was selling  Photos on an internet  Masturbating  Taking nude pictures  And selling his 
[00:46:30]  Semen stained underwear  He got fired  Went  Fought it through the courts  And we had to give him  His job back  But what got him  And what hopefully  Kenny didn't do  Is that he had been  Caught earlier  And given a direct  Order to knock it off  So he ended up  Getting fired  For disobeying  A direct order  So they couldn't  Get him on any  First amendment stuff  That's how he got  His job back  But because he  Had violated an order  They went ahead  And booted him out  And the thing is  Like what you're saying  Like a guy  Masturbating in his  Uniform and selling  Photos and then  Selling his load  Stained underwear 
[00:47:00]  I mean can anybody  Not see the difference  Between that type  Of sociopathic behavior  And a guy  Blowing off steam  Telling some dumb jokes  In a proper  And appropriate setting  I agree  And I don't think  He's going to have  Too much to worry about  Based on court decisions  In the past  As long as  He hadn't been told  In the past  Knock this off  And from everything  I'm hearing from you guys  It doesn't sound like  That's the case  And to be honest with you  Would they even be able  To tell him to knock it off  I mean  Would they be able  To tell a guy  In your private life  Don't go out  And do stand up comedy  To blow off steam  I mean would they be able 
[00:47:30]  To if it's not moonlighting  I mean I don't even know  If they could do that  Well yeah  Getting paid for  It's a different issue  And stuff  His act  If it is  You know like you guys  Are saying it  Yeah they could  We do sign  Like the other cop  From Debbie or whatever  Said  We are aware  That anything we do  Off duty  Could get you in trouble  If it brings  Negative light  On the department  And that's what  The department's  Looking at  And the teacher  Or the cop  That was just on  Is saying  They are going to  Suspend them  While they do  The interview  Or the investigation  And then  I think he'll be 
[00:48:00]  Reinstated  But yeah  They could tell you  Don't do this  Don't do that  And you have  To get  An agreement  For outside  Employment  Whether it's  Coaching high school  Baseball  Or comedy  Or whatever  So they could  Say not to do it  Right  And then if you  Did it  It's a violation  Of an order  And that could  Get you fired  But not what  You  Excuse me  Not what you  Said  Right  Alright thanks  Brian  Thank you  We're going to  Try to move  On here  Dave in West  Virginia  Dave  Yeah  Hey  I just started  Listening to you  Guys on the  On XM  Love a show  Thanks  Hey I got  Two good words 
[00:48:30]  For you  Sean Hannity  If you're looking  For a story  This is a story  Man  Well Sean  Listen to our  Show every morning  If he's listening  I would love to  Get him on the  Show and see  What he thinks  Of this  Yeah we're  Trying to get  Him  We're trying  To get him  Actually  Thank you  David  Alright  Fun chat  We'll send  The bat signal  Out to  Sean Hannity  Give us a call  Sean  Or if someone  Knows Sean  Call him at home  And tell him  Opie and Anthony  Needs him for a  Second or two  John in Miami  What's up  Hey let's be honest  You guys are just  Radio whores  You know 11 o'clock  Comes and you're 
[00:49:00]  Going to go to  Lunch  And not give a shit  About club soda  Kenny  Wow  You sure don't know  What goes on  Behind the scenes  Yeah no we're  Actually really good  Friends off the air  That's a  That's a strong  Statement there  John  Howard Stern  Told me to call  And say that  I'm sorry  Did I screw up  Something  Oh dude  Oh god dude  You're an embarrassment  To yourself  You think so  Yeah  Go ahead  Your phone call  Was awful  No it wasn't  Pretty bad  Howard Stern  Told me to call  Yeah  Come on  Come on  This was probably  The best call  Of the morning 
[00:49:30]  Oh god  Thanks John  You're embarrassing  What a cornball  Dan in Connecticut  Dan  Hey I was just  Going to say  The same kind of  Thing happened  To that wrestler  John Bradshaw  Layfield  He was doing  Like an anti-Hispanic  Thing on the WWE  And then the next  Thing he got fired  From CNBC  Because it was  Too offensive  Oh yeah  That's right  He's the guy  The wrestler  Bradshaw  I knew him as  Bradshaw  When I was watching  When I was watching  Wrestling  I haven't watched  In a few years now 
[00:50:00]  But he was all  Hip on stocks  Turns out  He's pretty brilliant  With his finances  There  And CNBC  Gave him a little spot  On the show  Then he did some  Offensive material  For WWE  And the ring  Total character  Total character  And then  Next thing you know  CNBC  Fires his ass  Yep  It's amazing  What happens out there  It's amazing  When you're saying  Things that are  Just politically  Incorrect  How the reaction is  No one gives a shit  About your right 
[00:50:30]  To free speech  When it comes to  Something like that  Well  Should not tolerate  Officers who joke  About rape  Comma  Regardless of  Their right  To speak freely  Wrong lady  That's a very  Dangerous statement  That is completely  Included in the right  To free speech  Not regardless  It's unpopular speech  Has to be protected  That's the  That's exactly  What it's about  Stupid  There's too many  Americans that have  No concept  Of what  The freedom of speech  Is  They just don't know 
[00:51:00]  Look I'm not a lawyer  But I remember  In high school  I believe  And I know  Someone will correct me  Free speech  Covers most free speech  Except for  They call it  TPM  Time  Place  And manner  Like you can't yell  Fire in a movie theater  I'd say it's free speech  We knew that one  You can't incite a riot  Always hear that one  That's the best example  Where you can't incite a riot  Sometimes free speech  Means you're gonna hear  Some terrible awful things  Yes  And that's what people  Don't understand  How about don't yell  Anything in a movie theater  I'm trying to watch the movie  Absolutely  If you're black  You can't go into a movie theater 
[00:51:30]  Oh no  I hope they don't fire me for that  Sorry guys  Just kidding  LOL  Let's see  Well a couple more  And then we'll try to move on here  Mike in Pennsylvania  Mike  Hey guys  I don't want to rain on anybody's parade  But the problem is  This isn't a First Amendment issue  Now bear with me here  Alright  I'm in the adult entertainment industry  As a producer  And we're dealing with a big  First Amendment issue right now  With this thing called 2257  It's these regulations 
[00:52:00]  Which are really restricting  Speech and everything  Because it's the threat of prosecution  What's going on with Kenny is  Is it's an employment issue  He's not being threatened  With prosecution  And going to jail  And stuff like that  The First Amendment  Protects against  You know  The government coming after you  Taking your stuff  And throwing you in jail  As an employment issue  I don't know if New Jersey  Is a right to work state  But in Pennsylvania  If you walk in one day  And the boss decides  He doesn't like the way  You dyed your hair  Because he likes blondes 
[00:52:30]  As opposed to brunettes  He can get rid of you  Yeah but you know what  I know what you're saying  No one is saying  That he's being legally  They're not threatening him  With jail  But freedom of speech  Still covers you at work  It most certainly does not  You're completely wrong  In a lot of cases it does  Well it  Then you're saying  That after that happens  The boss just kind of  You know  Rings his hands of you  And shuts the door  And there's no repercussions  For him or his  Place of employment  Exactly  But as it comes to  Down to a first amendment issue  And believe me 
[00:53:00]  I wish it was the other way  Because it's a big pain  In the ass  So wait  Let me ask you a question  Let's say you're there  With your boss  And you're talking to somebody  And he overhears you  Saying I voted for Bush  You're saying that  He could fire you for that  And you wouldn't have  A legal case in court  Where you could sue for millions  Here's the thing  He doesn't have to tell you  Why he's firing you  I don't know  Where is that  Like when you're a cop  I know  First of all  You work for the government  When you're a cop  It's not a privately owned  Family business  He's a cop 
[00:53:30]  He's paid by the government  I know  But the difference is  Is that he's collecting  A paycheck  And he's an employee  As opposed to them  Coming to his house  Knocking on his door  And arresting him  Because he was on stage  Saying something  You know  That they didn't like  It's different  That's unfortunate  But it is  I don't think it is  I know what you're saying  About civil  And his case  Maybe civil  And they're not  Threatening to put him in jail  But they can't  I don't think  Just throw away  Your freedom of speech 
[00:54:00]  You're saying basically  That an employer  Can just fire you  With no cause whatsoever  If he doesn't like  Something you say  They can't stop him  From doing that  They can't say to him  Okay  You can't go back  To the comedy club  And do that  They can just say  If you want to keep  Your job  You can't  I disagree  I don't think  They can say that  They certainly can  Well then why  Have the courts  Overturned it  Why have the courts  Sided with cops  You'll have to look  In the difference  Between civil  And criminal  The First Amendment 
[00:54:30]  Will only fall  On the criminal side  Not the civil side  I don't think  That's true  I'm not a lawyer  But I don't think  That's true  Look into  Look into everything  That's going on  With  You can't compare  Porn dude  I know what you're saying  I'm a big porn fan  But porn  They're basically  Attacking the idea  Of porn  No one's attacking  You understand  Doing stand up comedy  Is a complete  No one's attacking  That idea  They're only saying  The way he did it  We don't like  With porn  It's a totally  Different issue  That's a religious issue  It's sickening  But come on  It's a totally 
[00:55:00]  Different thing  Alright Mike  Thank you  Uncle Sam  Off instant feedback  From whackbag.com  Is this MSNBC  Or is it the ONA show  Stop the legal  Calling people  They all suck  Boring  What a douche bag  Shut the fuck up  Uncle Sam go fuck yourself  Go fuck yourself  I like the rest  Of his posts there  Go fuck yourself  Let me quickly  Explain here  One of our boys  Is in trouble  I don't give a fuck  About doing an  Entertaining radio show  Today  We talk about  What's on our minds  One of our guys  Is in deep trouble  And we're going

Bloomberg  It's Mayor Bloomberg  Perhaps when the mayor  Drops in on your fucking office  You could clear your screen  Of the solitaire game  You fucking  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  He was away from the computer  He didn't know he was coming in 
[01:01:30]  I am such an ass  Wait so Mayor Bloomberg  The mayor of New York City  Yeah  Walked in  And saw this guy  Playing solitaire  Not playing  Yeah Jimmy's right  He was away from his computer  But stupid  Left the solitaire game  Up on his computer  As he's walking around  Doing things or whatever  Right  And Bloomberg  Is walking around the office  He looks over  And sees a screen  With solitaire on it  And then I'm sure  He's read all the articles  About how many man hours  Are lost every year  To computer  People gaming  And being online 
[01:02:00]  And he loses his mind  Just goes  Whose desk is that?  Whose desk was that?  Boop  Fired  Ah the mayor is delusional  Yeah he's a fucking billionaire  It's like the guy makes  30,000 a year  Why?  I mean war numbers  Just spent him for a week  But why do you get a shit  There's no  That's front page on the post  By the way  That cop died  Who was shot  By the other cop  And had his leg cut off  After being attacked  By those fucking chimps  Outside White Castle  Yeah he's dead  And that's kind of  Like a little corner  And here's the big things  On the cover of the post  The page 6 magazine advertisement

[01:03:00]  He only makes  30,000 a year  Do you think he  Even talked to him  Or just went to someone else  And said  No  The story says  Well we can do it now  This was a tease  But Mayor Bloomberg  Had a city clerical worker fired  So he saw it  And then went to  This guy's boss  He should have walked  Right up to the guy  And really berated him  In front of  The rest of the employees  That would have gotten him  After visiting his office  And getting enraged  When he saw a solitaire  Card game on his computer  Poor guy 
[01:03:30]  I can almost say  He was making 30,000 a year  At work  But a solitaire game  Of all the computer things  You could do  That's the  Fucking  The guy should be fired  For just being a bore  And he was on the job  For six years  Only making 30,000 a year  You know what though  Bloomberg  Every time you see him  He's just working  He's biking to work  And then he gets there  And he rolls up  His shirt sleeves  Hangs out in the bullpen  With all the  The rest of the people  He doesn't have  His separate little office  Somewhere away  He's constantly working  And he walks in 
[01:04:00]  And sees this guy  His computer's got solitaire on it  It's not gonna  It's not gonna go over too well  With that guy  With Bloomberg  Alright  That's pretty sad though  I don't know  Should he have been fired?  No  But should he have been  So fucking stupid?  No  And on the way  Dummy of the day  Dummy of the day  On the way  And we're hearing things

[01:08:00]  Did you watch the Grammys  Bits and pieces  Why bits and pieces  Kind of boring  Were you changing the channels a lot  No  Where did you watch the Grammys  We were working on some stuff  And we watched part of it  When we could  In the producer's studio  Also known as our big office  No  The producer's room  Next door to the studio  Earl  Everyone crowded into that tiny room  To watch the Grammys 
[01:08:30]  Instead of on the nice couches  In our big office  With a huge flat screen  Big flat screen  Plasma TV  Oh  It was just like  Earl let's ask straight out  Was anybody  From  Your staff  In the Opie and Anthony office  At any time  Last night  Um  No  No  I mean outside of  We were working on a  Couple of production pieces

[01:10:30]  Don't fucking change  The channel  The channel  On the big screen TV  Cannot be changed  Because the remote  Not only changes that  It changes every one  Of the boxes on there  That are recording  Separate channels  And all of a sudden  We have nothing  Uh that we were recording  The night before  Now I've seen three  On three different occasions  The same emails go out  Because this has happened before  And your staff  Is supposed to be  Completely aware of this  I've gotten emails  Where it says  Your staff 
[01:11:00]  Is completely aware  Of this  And yet again  It happened  What is Danny showing me  Danny's got a  Danny just tell  Some type of evidence  Danny what is that  Well basically I wanted to see  What was going on  On the PC  Uh last night  So I just did a search  For last modified files  And everything that's coming up  Is Ron and Fez production  Between the hours  Of 8 and 11  8 and 11 at night  So not only  Was someone in the office  They were in there  From 8 o'clock  Till 11 o'clock  For three hours  I was working on  Eric's computer 
[01:11:30]  We were there pretty late  So you're telling me  So what they did was  You watched part of the Grammys  Not all of them  But they didn't watch them  On the computers  And the TVs in the office  The big flat screen  They ran in  To this little shitty  Peep booth  And watched them here  Next to the studio  That's what we're supposed to  Even though you were  In our office  For three straight hours  Doing Ron and Fez production  He wouldn't  You guys are fucking lying  You're lying  Earl you are lying now  Why would you watch the Grammys  In this tiny little studio  When you were  In our huge office  With a huge flat screen 
[01:12:00]  For the entire Grammy broadcast  For the entire  What?  I will tell you the segment  That we happened to catch  I don't give a shit  What you watched  Of the Grammys  The fact is  You watched it in our office  And someone changed the channel  On the TV  And they fucked us bad today  Was the channel changed  On the TV  During the time  You were in there  For three hours  Um  I don't  Oh god  Yes you do know  Just answer  You do know  You know 
[01:12:30]  For the sake of  Guilt  Yes  Who changed the channel  It was probably me  I was  Now Warren you told  Earl  In three different times  That that channel  Is not to be changed  Because it interferes  With the other boxes  I fucked up  I'm sorry  You fucked up  What again  This is the third time  That I can count  And I pay no attention  To what goes on  In this fucking place  Third time  Third time  Third time  But this time 
[01:13:00]  For the sake of everything  I did it  Well one time  I didn't do it  Earl  One time is too many  We're a very popular talk show  That broadcasts  In two fucking countries  And you're sitting there  With the remote  Fucking us up  Oh god  We love Ron and Fez  But you guys are ridiculous  Behind the scenes  You cost us a lot  Of fucking audio today  How about you help the show  And you sing all the performances  Because we don't have them  Do your impression of Bono  Because we really need it now 
[01:13:30]  Yeah  What did you see  I mean I didn't even see  You know what I saw  We saw the  I don't care what you saw  We care that you changed the channel  When people have told you  Don't change the channel  Because it fucks up our recordings  And then you denied it  Yeah  And then you denied it  You lied  You lied  And then I asked you  If anyone was in the office  And your first response  To that was no  And then it turns out  We were working on production  All night last night  Earl  I don't give a shit  But when you were initially asked 
[01:14:00]  You said no  Which was a lie  You lied  And now  What?  E-Rock  You got something  No you said did anyone  Touch the  No we said we were in the office  And you said no  I just asked if anyone  Was in the office at all  And at first you said no  We were working on production  Last night  Right  E-Rock  What do you got?  Earl  Didn't you call me last night  In a panic  Around 7.35  Asking how to reset  The television recording program  On the computer  Yes  Oh  And did I not walk you through it  Saying do you see this  Do you see that  Are you watching TV  Yes  You were watching TV 
[01:14:30]  Is everything back online  Yes  And what did I tell you  I said  Is everything set now  Was the television set  On the monitor  And why did you get in that situation  To begin with  Yeah you knew you fucked up then  Because instead of minimizing it  I hit the other button  By accident  He disconnected the actual  He turned the program off  That is set to record the television  I walked through him with it  And you told me  Everything was fine  Earl you were in the office  I'm asking you to tell me  What was on the screen  I'm like  Do you see this  Yes  Do these little red dots

[01:15:30]  And then fucked up  Eight minutes later  Exactly  So we could play Madonna  You know  Trying to look like  Farrah Fawcett  In a leotard  That's our Grammy coverage  So like  So Earl may have actually fixed it  And then completely fucked it up again  By turning it off  Eight minutes later  By changing the channel  Or something else  Yeah  Why are these guys allowed in our office  That's what I need to know  Because  I love Ron and Fez  They do an unbelievable show  I listen every day  But I gotta tell you  Their people behind the scenes 
[01:16:00]  Are incompetent  And have no business  Being in our office  Where the big boys play  Well wait  Get the fucking guys  A little Commodore computer  And you know  And let them hang out  Somewhere else  You guys  Don't deserve  To be in our office  How else  Don't deserve  They don't  Anything done  Because it's shit like this  You do stuff that you've been told  Not to do with the TV  And you fucked us  You cost us audio  A lot of it 
[01:16:30]  You don't understand though  I do understand  You cost us audio  And lie about it  Why  What  There you go  Yeah jump up and down on luggage  Great  Way to go  Way to go  Way to go  Stop sucking  You fucked up  Who put the grilled cheese sandwich  In the VCR  Which one of the infants  That work for Ron and Fez  Did that  When you break Earl  This time  And he hung up 
[01:17:00]  Earl  He just jumped up and down  Like a lunatic  You know let me tell you something  Who fucking cares  For anybody that listens  Sorry go ahead  For anyone that listens  To the Ron and Fez show  And hears Earl  Bantering with Ron and Fez  That's the new Earl  By the way  That is the new Earl  We don't know that Earl  The Earl you just heard  Is the Earl we have known  For six  Seven years  Has it been  I don't even know  At this point  But that is the Earl  We know  That is the Earl  We have had contact with  For seven fucking years 
[01:17:30]  He just had a flashback  He had a flashback  What he did  Was he took the  Receiver of his phone  And smashed it  That's the sound  You were hearing  He was smashing it  On the table  It either broke  Or after that  He hung up  He definitely broke  His phone  He broke his phone  And the anger  That came out  In that  Was directed  He acted at no one  But himself  Because he knows  He fucked up  I gotta communique  To Don Wicklund  We don't want them  In our office  You guys  Love Ron and Fez  But don't want  Their people 
[01:18:00]  In our office  You gotta wire  Their office  With a computer  That the production  Whatever they need  Can be done  Can't be trusted  We've had emails  We've had notes posted  We've told people  Personally  And still  Our recordings  Get fucked up  And this is a huge day  Where we really needed  The TVs  Because we wanted to  You know  Play some of the shit  From the Grammys  It's the Grammys  Yeah  It's  They need their own stuff  Whatever they need  To record  Whatever they need  To record  They need in  Their office

[01:25:00]  Last night  So what  I don't care  Just stay off the TV  Don't work on the computer  Big deal  All kidding aside  Don Wicklund  You gotta take care of this  Because we've had it  We can't have guys  Changing the channel  And fucking up all our recordings  I don't have to get  Streamed at  At 8.15 in the morning  Hey Errol  Thanks  Now we get to play  Our Black Earl song  I love this song  After the song  What happened  Oh Derek is yelling and screaming  Derek turn your mic on 
[01:25:30]  Everyone is pissed off today  I've never seen  A crankier fucking show  I love it  Than the Opie and Anthony show  This day  Everyone is fucking  In a crank  Even E-Rock  Who's the most timid member  Of the show  Went off  E-Rock unloaded on Earl  I bow to E-  Look I'll do it on  Pal Talk and everything  I bow  Please don't  Yes  That's right  Good boy  Nice bow  Do we got the Black Earl song  Oh now it's over here  Alright we're gonna play this  When we get back  We got Judah coming in

[01:26:30]  Laura Korn  Looking more like Barbara Eden  Every day  She's outside the studio  Nice cheeks  Jesus  To give us some  Some sex advice I guess  Ben anything  I screwed up  I read wrong  Wow  All right  No problem  Ah you read nope  Dave from Florida  What's up  Hey I was just wondering  If you caught the Bubba show  Last night  And heard what he had to say  About you  No that guy is hilarious  And what did he say  What did Todd say today  He called Opie a pussy  And he called Anthony a pussy 
[01:27:00]  And he called the pest  A big bunch of pussy  And I saw Opie he was going to kick his little redheaded ass  And that he was a zit face motherfucker  Todd yeah  Todd Todd  I was before Accutane  I gotta say Accutane is a great thing  I was a little zit face motherfucker  But Accutane I endorse it  Wait what else did this edgy morning show guy say  This guy's crazy don't get on his bad side  He just called me a bunch of pussies  Over and over and over  Oh wow see 
[01:27:30]  How little money you make  And how important  How little money  You only knew what kind of apartment  I was looking at the other day  Yeah you're right Todd  You're right Todd  What can I tell you  This is banter from a guy that has no intelligence  So he's going to bring it down to street level  I'm scared  You have no idea who you're fucking with Todd  Dude don't tag with that guy  He's got his own  He's an edgy morning guy  He's dangerous  He also kept saying to Howard 
[01:28:00]  To please beg  He was begging Howard never to hire you  Because he was  Blah blah blah  I don't think we have to worry about that  Blah  Thanks Dave  Alright man  Bye sweetie  Tell Bubba that you called us  And we got so scared  I think we'll be here at XM  Longer than Bubba's going to be over there at Sirius  Dude that guy's dangerous  Don't fucking tangle with him man  He says some edgy stuff  He's got like you know  A real scream of consciousness  Watch it  Watch it  Alright we gotta go right to Elo  We were going to do this after a break  But we got  Elo  Hey guys 
[01:28:30]  Hi Eric  Were you on hold during that conversation with Earl?  Oh yeah  Oh good you heard that  Black Earl my man  Can we please have Ron and Fez's office set up so that they can do their work in there?  I hear an ugly rumor that boxes arrived yesterday  Yeah why didn't you tell us that?  Because I wanted it to be one of those surprises for you  Because the bosses love hearing this yelling between the shows  Dissension  It's that fodder that we like  And then all of a sudden the boxes show up  And you're like the boxes show up  It's great  See if the captain of a ship has the crew going at each other 
[01:29:00]  They have less time to go at the captain  That's right  You gotta keep them at each other  Or else  Arr you get a mutiny  Arr  This is Captain Cleeg  And he wants Fred McMurray and Jose Ferrer  Arguing with each other  Arguing  As opposed to  So they don't notice that he's trying to keep count of how many strawberries are in a can  Exactly  That's right  Who's gopher?  Who's gopher in?  There are moving boxes all over the joint  Everyone's leaving except for us and Ron and Fez right?  Yeah  And we get the whole floor  Elo?  We're still working on a few details 
[01:29:30]  Oh my god  Why?  Help  Oh it's  It's all  You know when you live in D.C.  Everything's political  There is a certain someone that doesn't want to leave  For what reason?  I'm not sure  But I am investigating  I hope he's going to be comfortable with the situation here  Well I'm sure that the environment will change slightly  And there might be a different point of view at that point in time  Perhaps a wall can be built  Look I'm hearing rumors  I will talk for myself that there's someone that lives very close to this facility 
[01:30:00]  And doesn't want to walk a lousy two blocks to a brand new state of the art facility  I don't know  Because his commute would be a little longer  And it's not about that  It's about I don't want to be told what to do because I know so and so  That's what it is  But logically it doesn't make sense  We're doing our own thing here and he does his thing which is a lot different than ours  Are we going to still have to put the shades down when we're doing crazy stuff in here?  I think we're going to do what we do and just deal with it from there  You know there's a story in the New York paper today  They're building this building and some dude owns a tree 
[01:30:30]  Yeah  And he doesn't want his tree cut down  So the construction company said  Alright fuck you  And built the entire house or building around this tree  Yeah I saw that  The wall itself is right where the tree was  So they actually had to make a break in the cinder blocks  Where they're building this wall  And put the wall right  The tree right inside of a wall  Wow  And that's what they're doing  Did you notice they didn't leave enough room for the tree to grow?  No  I think it's just going to come through the walls in a few years  It's going to be a nightmare  But I guess we're going to have to do the same thing around here 
[01:31:00]  I think it's  We're going to have to build around this certain person's space  What kind of an asshole  Why don't they just chop the tree down and say  Sew us or here's your tree  Go report  Why would you fucking do that?  Then you've got Greenpeace  And you've got a lot of other things  See the sad part is  We just want our own space  We would go to the brand new state of the art facility  We don't give a shit  We just want our own space  If everyone leaves it  Well that's what I mean  If we had our own area  We just want our own area  Without holdouts  We've got holdouts  This place can be a paradise for this show 
[01:31:30]  I have an image in my mind of that entire out there space  Set up where any other studio would look silly  Silly compared to it  But now there's going to be like an albatross as they call it  How many holdouts?  What's that?  One or two holdouts  One and a half  One and a half holdouts  One lousy guy doesn't want to leave?  But I think we have a  I was meeting this morning actually with Tony  And I think we've got a very interesting solution that will solve that 
[01:32:00]  Hopefully it involves fucking cement shoes and a trip to the Hudson River  Oh man  All right  Great  Anyway Elo  Congratulations  Did you get a piece of paper from me?  Yeah congratulations  This is huge for XM  Why don't you go ahead and read it?  I don't even have it in front of me  Oprah and Fran's exclusive radio channel to launch on XM Satellite Radio  How about that?  We live in Oprah's world and now she's part of XM  Jesus 
[01:32:30]  New channel to feature diverse daily programming from popular Oprah personalities  Oprah personalities as well as original weekly reality radio program with Oprah Winfrey and Gail King  Now here's how smart XM Satellite Radio is  You know  As far as our listeners go  A few of them yes  But for the most part let's be honest here  Probably not as excited about this announcement as they would be maybe other announcements or something  But the variety that is XM 
[01:33:00]  Well they're building a  We're a media company  Yeah  We're just a one person company  Right  We're building an entertainment company  That's right  So the reason that Oprah is huge around the country and gets huge ratings and the women love her  The Midwest housewives  That whole crowd  They love her  And these are the people now you bring on board  Hey  They got 12 bucks right?  Absolutely  Well I tell you know  What's exciting about the channel is that you know it's an extension of Oprah and a lot of her friends 
[01:33:30]  Like Nate Berkus and Dr. Oz and Gail King and Bob Green and Marianne Williamson  And you know those are people who if you're an Oprah fan  You know who all those people are  If you're not an Oprah fan you'll probably discover them  And they're actually they're very interesting and very compelling and have a lot to say  And it's going to be a great self-help channel  How far away from 202 is it?  Uh far enough  How's that?  Don't want anyone tripping up 
[01:34:00]  Are we going to do any crossover shows together?  Yeah  It's doubtful  No?  Doubtful  Oh come on  Hey Oprah  I see that bat in the case  I see Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert do a little crossover at the end of the Daily Show for the Colbert Show  And I think us and Oprah would have that same rapport  Hell I'm just trying to get you guys dialed in with the damn Grammys for God's sakes  Get that done  Oh well it would be nice if we had some audio of it at least  That would have been nice  Yeah well you got Lee Abrams coming up so that's a ratings getter 
[01:34:30]  Well yeah no kidding  What a great show we have today  Woohoo  By the way just so you know  The big boss called me about Lee's behavior at the party  Yeah  And the term lug grabbing hugging and kissing was used several times  Yeah  Several people  What party?  It was the Clive Davis party  What was it held in LA?  Yeah  Yeah it was in LA  It was Tuesday night  Great party  Yeah  Was Lee in a pig mask  No it was just his normal face  Sitting on the edge of a bed in a hotel room 
[01:35:00]  And he was just hugging people  Hey there's a quote from Oprah Winfrey in this press release  We got to get Lee Abrams to talk about his behavior  Yeah so when he calls I mean who cares about the Grammys asking about his behavior at the party  And how you've heard from high executives higher than me  There's a couple things that are very interesting in this press release  Before we let you go  Sure buddy  A quote from Oprah Winfrey  Together with my friends 
[01:35:30]  We look forward to creating programming that will entertain, inform, and inspire our listening audience on XM  Is she going to talk about this on her show?  Absolutely  And I think that show will air Friday  I don't know the exact time  But I think the show is going to air on Friday  Tomorrow?  Yes  Tomorrow  I will confirm that with you guys today  But you can talk about it tomorrow more  But I think the show is going to air tomorrow  This is a huge announcement for XM  And then I noticed Hugh Pinero's quote  I want to get to the press release when we got signed to XM 
[01:36:00]  Because I think his quote was a little different than what he's saying about Oprah  Anthony would you like to read the Hugh Pinero quote?  Gee let me see  Right down here  It's that paragraph?  Yeah  The one that starts Oprah Winfrey  Yeah  Is a prolific force in our culture  Whose unprecedented achievements in television, film, publishing, and philanthropy  Will bring an amazing radio experience to the XM nation of subscribers  We are proud to welcome Oprah and her talented team to the XM family  Said Hugh Pinero, President and Chief Executive Officer, XM Satellite Radio 
[01:36:30]  Oprah and Friends, is a testament to XM's unwavering commitment to provide our diverse subscriber base  With the kind of smart, high quality programming that makes a difference in their lives  Actually guys, I mean that's fairly close to yours  You could pretty much just take out Oprah Winfrey and put in Oprah and Anthony  I think it was your quote actually  Oh no, we got the press release from when we were hired  Alright, let's compare  A little different  XM has been called the HBO of Satellite Radio 
[01:37:00]  And like HBO, we can provide O&A fans with a unique way to enjoy their edgy humor  Said Hugh Pinero  That's it, President and CEO of XM Satellite Radio  The O&A show is the latest example of the incredible range of programming available on XM  What happens to an amazing radio experience?  The safest statement ever  A subscriber base with smart, high quality  I mean, Jimmy, that sounds the same to me  Yeah, what about making a difference in their lives?  He might as well come out and say, well, you'll enjoy Opie and Anthony  If you enjoy eating dog shit sandwiches  What about our achievements in philanthropy? 
[01:37:30]  We had a woman naked crawling on the floor for $2,000 in a big mess of mousetraps  Well, no, I think the homeless shopping spree was a very philanthropic  Endeavor  Yes  We raised about $100,000 for the victims of Hurricane Katrina  We are proud to welcome Opie and Anthony and their talented team to the XM family  No, he didn't say that  We have a new press release come out  And then we have a new quote come in 
[01:38:00]  And that should really be the quote you should focus on  We'll have a new one  A new one?  Yeah, I'm sure we will  All right, congratulations  It's a big day down there in D.C.  It's a big day for all of our subscribers  And I think everybody should be really excited  And again, it's part of why we're the leader in the space and doing what we do  And Elo worked on this one very, very hard  Yes, I did  Congratulations to you, my friend  All right, guys, and good luck with Lee 
[01:38:30]  Bye, Eric  Thank you  Do we really have to have him on?  Jimmy, by the way, don't let Opie hang up on me  But I have the number for your car, so call me when you get done  Okay, thanks, man  Oh!  Thank you  You're welcome, buddy  Uh, what do you, Kenny?  I don't know yet  I'm gonna call somebody from GM, I'm not sure  Yeah  I don't know  I'm debating that, though  Something big  Gas guzzler  Hopefully  Yeah, keep the economy going  Okay, here's the deal  Grammy talk when we get back  And we'll say hi to Judah  And we got Laura Korn outside to talk about sex 
[01:39:00]  Laura Korn's back  You wanna talk about sex today, Judah?  Yeah, that could happen, sure  That could happen  That could happen  Yeah  Could happen  Where do you get glasses like that, man?  Uh, I got these from a dude in L.A.  Yeah  Freddie Laker  Yeah  Remember Freddie Laker?  No, I got this from this  These I got  It's from one of two guys  There's this one guy who does glasses for movies  He's one of the top glasses guys  Yeah  All the glasses and boogie nights he provided him  Ooh, those are great  And he's got like, uh, he's got a store and then he's got a house 
[01:39:30]  And it's, uh, but he uses it like a warehouse  It's literally floor to ceiling  Yeah  It's just glasses all over the place  And you can just rummage through them  Just, it's really cool  And you chose those  Yeah  This is what I came up with  Do you know what a nut you just sounded like, too?  This glasses guy does glasses  Yeah  The fucking randings of a lunatic  Glasses  Lots of glasses  That's probably a good way to summarize  I was looking at glasses  Kill a child  I bought some glasses  And I'd say he's probably got like, you know, 100,000 glasses in there 
[01:40:00]  Yeah  It's great  All right, we're gonna back up a little bit  We're gonna play the Black Earl song  As we go to break  Yes  And then we'll, uh, we'll reorganize here  Right  Check out this song  From Brother Joe, right?  Yes  Brother Joe did this one  I was born and raised in New York City  In a housing project way up in the hood  I dressed in dark clothing  So folks started calling me black girl  Oh, and they used to laugh about it  Cause deep down they knew they'd call me that  Cause I was as black as sud 
[01:40:30]  I've always been a lazy man  A cast potato with a clicker in my hand  See  Motivation I never had  Hit in the shadows when the boss got mad  But 20 years I never got a raise  I'm 33 and I've never been late  I look busy but I'm not  I'm just walking around  I pick up some papers and I put them back down  I'm damn gonna stop paying my rent  Live in a refrigerator box  Never get out of bed

I was in Tampa last night  I had a thing to do with the Cox Radio Group  So I did that  Then I did Hannity and Combs  And then we got on a plane and flew home  We were just laughing about you  Judah and I  Because he's like  This guy's an animal  He does a radio show  He's got like seven shows  TV  Living in Long Island, commuting  I'm like, he's awake?  I'm like, how does he do it?  I don't know how you do it  Listen, they've got me on the air at 6, what?  7 in the morning 
[01:46:30]  When you guys start, I've been on with you  Yeah, yeah  That's true  That's a really slow news day  They call Hannity at 7 a.m.  And you got kids and everything, right, Sean?  I got two kids  I got a studio out here on Long Island, though  And so it makes my life really easy  Wow  So you're not commuting anymore?  No, I do commute  I have to go do Hannity and Combs in the city  Oh, that's right, duh  But the commute will kill you  I mean, I would love to get out to Long Island more often  But I can't  That commute is brutal  No, you know what?  You've just got to go in off hours 
[01:47:00]  And if you do it that way, it's not bad  If you go in the middle of rush hour, you're out of your mind  I'm in in about 25 minutes  At 5 in the morning, 5.30 in the morning  I'd ask where you live  Yeah, but you live in Long Island  I'm in North Shore, Nassau County  Yeah, well, I'm in the North Shore  Just on the Suffolk border there  Hey, we'll get together  You come over to my house  I come over to your house  Hey, listen  I think I have more fun over at your house  I don't know why  It's probably a little livelier  Than changing diapers and having fun  Same thing goes on at my house  And I'm not even married with kids  Mine, too, because I live with my parents 
[01:47:30]  By the way, do you see your producer  What's his screen name here?  Sex Bagel?  Yeah  That's Iraq  You've got to change that, Eric  Yeah, isn't it not professional for a producer to be sending out that email address?  It's funny because I figured it was one of those things  Hi, my name is Sally and I live in your town  So I wasn't going to hit it and I just accidentally hit it  And then it's Eric and I'm like, Eric  I love how Sean has to be very careful 
[01:48:00]  I accidentally hit it  My mouse just clicked on it  Oops  Get out of here  Accidentally  He's got a screen name that should be part of that Dateline special  On the Predators?  Yeah, that was a good one  Anyway, but Judah thinks you're an animal  And you make us all look bad  Because I'm like, you know, Judah, you're right  I have a 12-block commute and I bitch every day to do a 5-hour radio show  Man, that's pretty cold  And you've got a radio show, a TV show, a family, a commute  You're flying to gigs all over the country 
[01:48:30]  You're going to Tampa to meetings with the brass  Back and forth to Tampa  Yeah  Look, we do the Hanatization of America tour  We'll have to make it the Hanatization of 0-8 tour  Listen, Anthony's already here  Opie, you know what we've got to work on  I agree with a lot of what Sean says  There are a few things I don't agree on  But I think politically we're pretty close  We're pretty in sync  Look, you probably would be happy to hear  I'm giving up my Republican registration  I'm re-registering as a conservative  I've never really considered myself a Republican 
[01:49:00]  But sort of like a Reagan conservative  Right  I believe in a strong, kick-ass national defense  I want to track down these people that want to knock down towers in America  And blow up American cities  And get nuclear bombs and bring them over these cities  Yep  I love the music, guys  And I believe cutting taxes  And because I think Opie and Anthony pay way too much every year in taxes  You ought to be able to keep all your money  Very simple  I agree  I like the way you think  See, who has a problem with that? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, I mean, if you're a liberal  You still have to wake up in the morning  And hit yourself with a head and say  You know what?  I don't pay enough in taxes  See, I don't have a problem with that  Now, obviously, if you're switching from Republican  Now, that kind of sounds like what the Republicans want  The perception of them to be  It is, but you know what?  Like a lot of people that get in power  They get a little bit arrogant  They become a lot like Democrats  I'll tell you what did it for me  When they had that transportation bill in Washington  And they snuck in 6,000 separate pork-barrel spending projects 
[01:50:00]  To the tune of $25 extra billion  I said, you know what?  You're acting like little Democrats  And I had been registered a conservative for a long time  And I just had to re-register in New York  I had wanted to vote in the primary  So that's why I had switched over for a day or two  Isn't that great how they do that?  And it's just  And no one really gets what that's all about  They come out with a bill  And it sounds like  It sounds like something that would be very good for the country 
[01:50:30]  And they load it with these little  Like you said, pork-barrel agendas  And the bill doesn't pass  And then when election time rolls around  They go, Mr. Smith didn't sign a bill on education  You know, it's the one time you get Democrats and Republicans to work together  Because they all pat each other on the back  And they say, okay, if you support my $10 billion of taxpayer waste  I'll support your $10 of taxpayer waste  And it's like this scheme that these guys have devised 
[01:51:00]  So what they do is then they go back to their districts  And they tell their constituents  Oh, I got money for a bridge  I got money to rebuild a school  I got money for a basketball court  I got money for a tennis court  I got money for a spa for Opie and Anthony  And then, you know what, they say, oh, great  Now everybody wants to vote them back into office  And it happens, you know, every two years they start doing this  Because they view that as the mechanism by which they get to stay in power  And the whole system is corrupt  I don't want that for my government 
[01:51:30]  Frankly, you know what, there's a libertarian side of me  I am a moral conservative also  But there's a libertarian side  I want less government in my life  I want less government restriction  Just give me a kick-ass Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines  And we're all set  Don't we want to just know that we're protected  And want to be able to achieve  To the best of our ability  We want to be able to keep as much of what we make as we can  And still support the country and the government 
[01:52:00]  But not have all your tax money getting wasted  You know, I love when it says, oh, we need to tax the rich  And then you look, and the rich now is, what, $100,000 a year and more?  That's surviving  The top 10%, Anthony, pays 70% of the federal tax bill  Yeah  You know, Reagan did something pretty amazing  And John Kennedy had done the same thing  When Reagan came into office, he dropped the top marginal tax rates from 90% to 28% 
[01:52:30]  And all the liberals at the time said Reagan was going to lead us into the next depression  And this is, it's not economically feasible  And what happened is, and remember, he was building up the military at the same time  He was pursuing strategic defense  He was confronting the Soviets at the time  But he cut those taxes  And in eight years, revenues didn't go down  But the people who got the money back started spending it  And as a result, it kick-started the economy that was in a malaise 
[01:53:00]  And revenues went up from over $500 billion to over a trillion dollars  They doubled in eight years  And, you know, if you believe in free market capitalism  You want the rich people in this country  The ones that have the wealth  I never got a job from a poor guy  You want these guys to spend money  You want them to create jobs  Because that creates opportunities for all the rest of us  Now that makes sense  So I read  Absolutely  We got you on the phone today, Sean  We want your take on Club Soda Canning  Did you read the article yet?  Yeah, I've been reading the article 
[01:53:30]  I have one question that's not answered in the article, though  Okay  Did...  I don't really care what he was joking about  That's not really relevant to the topic  Was he aware of any rules in place?  Did he agree to any rules when he signed up in this public service position  That he wouldn't do stuff like this when he became a cop?  Don't know, to be honest with you  Yeah, we really don't know  I'm not sure  He said, for example, sometimes in public service jobs  They say, okay, you can do the job 
[01:54:00]  But there's a set of rules and standards that apply to you as a cop  Because of what you do  Like a cop is sort of on duty 24 hours  And if he had signed an agreement that he wouldn't do something like that  That would be the only thing I'd say  Well, he agreed to that  Otherwise, what he does in his off time, I see, is his off time  Yeah  How much of a freedom of speech issue is it like  Especially since he wasn't being paid for it  And it was in a place where there was all adults  And it wasn't anything obscene as far as behavior is concerned  It was just stand-up  You know, look, you run into a problem when you do really over-the-line stand-up 
[01:54:30]  And you also have a public service job  Because there's always going to be somebody that's not going to like what you say  He's going to be offended by it  And you guys know better than anybody else  You know, the reaction that you're going to get out of some people  You know, my attitude would be  He's got an alter ego here  He's got another identity in this position  It's humor  Whether you like it or dislike it  There's nothing true about what he's saying  He's just joking around  It may not be the topics people like  Apparently it was pretty risque 
[01:55:00]  Yeah  It was pretty brutal  But it was in a comedy club, you know  Yeah  It was in context  It wasn't like he was on a street corner  Yelling at like a madman  You know, he's in a comedy club  Where people go in and expect to hear this kind of stuff  Yeah, well, exactly  I mean, it was the type of comedy club  Where you'd expect it to be over-the-top  Yes  Yeah  Yeah  It was a cringe humor show  It was called Cringe Humor  And it was also  He didn't identify himself as a cop  He doesn't even use the same name  His real name  I think Sean brought up a good point, too  It's not  Sometimes it isn't even about the free speech issue 
[01:55:30]  And what it technically, on paper  If it was a math problem  Should work out to be  It's like  This is just the way it is  Because this is the society we live in today  People get offended  People can lose their jobs over it  And maybe they shouldn't  But that just happens these days  You know, look  You guys know  From all your years on the radio  And for most days that you were on terrestrial radio  You guys went into work  Not knowing if you'd have a job by the end of the day 
[01:56:00]  Yeah  You knew what you were doing  You lived on the edge  It's what has brought you to the dance  It made you popular  And that's what got you a big contract  And that's what gets so many people to tune into you every day  When you bring up topics  Any time  And I don't care what the scenario is  If you start talking about rape  Pedophilia  And bestiality  Mm-hmm  As apparently this guy was talking about  In this comedy club  You're going to get people to notice you  Yeah  And there are going to be people right off the top 
[01:56:30]  Naturally, I think  Offended  Now, I believe in free speech  I make my living with the First Amendment  He has the right to do it  But if he has another job  Where he's working in public service somewhere  He's probably going to raise eyebrows  And draw attention to himself  And risk getting in trouble  Right  What was the quote from that lady?  Jimmy, again?  Do you have the article?  It was about  This infuriated us  It's at the top of the page there  It was  Listen to this, Sean  It was a woman who's  Here's this 
[01:57:00]  However, Alana Goble  Assistant Director of the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault  Said police departments should not tolerate officers who joke about rape  Regardless of their right to speak freely  And it's regardless of their right to speak freely  Which really annoys me  Because that is the argument in there  That every special interest group uses  To justify they're trying to restrict other people saying what they want to say  But you know something  Think back, Opie and Anthony  When you guys signed contracts with terrestrial radio stations  Right  You know, they have a whole bunch of moral clauses in there 
[01:57:30]  You know, if you bring any disrepute to the station  It doesn't meet societal standards  You know, regardless of whatever the standards were  With the FCC  I mean, basically they would write in these writers  That would allow them to find some sneaky way to fire you  Yeah, we understand all that  We have a problem with this lady that's, you know  Talking about freedom of speech, though  The First Amendment  How did she even find out about it?  Someone probably sent it to her  It's probably someone gunning for him to send it to her 
[01:58:00]  Well, somebody apparently has a DVD that he sent out  No, he didn't  Somebody else took it off the website and sent it  He didn't  Do you know what he said?  Because she says he's joking about rape  What did he say?  Because he's sort of like Andrew Dice Clay, this guy?  Yeah, it was just sort of a rape joke  But it was a joke joke  It wasn't talking about a real thing  It was just  It was jokes  Yeah  Don't get us so wrong  It is some heinous material  I mean  But  But  You know  If he was doing something  Where's the line there?  If he was doing something that was slightly risque 
[01:58:30]  Would  Would they have come down on him a little bit?  If he was doing a completely clean act  Would they have ignored it?  I mean  Then it is just what is coming out of his mouth  Not the fact that he's doing stand-up  On his off time  It's  He's in a cop uniform on the corner  Yeah  He would joke with his own little mic on the corner  If he signs some additional moral clause  Or if there's a moral clause in his contract  Because  He's a public service officer 
[01:59:00]  He's probably in real trouble  But how come the courts have sided with cops?  Didn't they  What did they do about the  I think it was the fireman of the cops  That Giuliani fired for blackface  There was a case in Baltimore in 85  Of a guy who was in blackface  The Baltimore case  Yeah  Even though it sparked outrage  The  The court of appeals there  Ruled that they couldn't punish him  For performing that way  Yeah  Okay so  How about  In New York we had a different result  Didn't we?  Yeah what finally happened with that?  Didn't the cops  Didn't they get reinstated  After Giuliani had them fired? 
[01:59:30]  I'm not sure if they got reinstated  I'll google it later  Yeah I gotta look at that  Okay  Look at Hannity's gonna do some research for us  And is off time  You know what  It may be a really good question  And maybe we need to do a Hannity and Combs on this  And maybe we can bring ONA and this guy on  And then maybe see if the police department would respond to it  The bottom line is  It's like doing stand-up comedy in an adult situation  Where it's called a cringe humor show  And doing stand-up comedy  I mean moral clauses can go so far  But I don't think they can infringe on your right to do that 
[02:00:00]  He can do whatever he wants  And he can keep doing it  But if he signed an agreement with the police department  Prior to that  He's not gonna have a lot of legal ground to stand on  If he wants to go back and get his job  That is sort of a tricky  You know the other thing he could have done is  You know you can make your  You know remember a cop is a cop 24 hours a day  Most cops carry weapons 24 hours a day  So he's gotta conduct himself  Off the job a lot differently than say Opie and Anthony do  Because we know what they did the whole time they were in Vegas  Which was really totally and completely out of control 
[02:00:30]  That's according to me listening to your show  A lot of lattes and a lot of lost money  These two are sissies  They're just nice faithful guys  Sissy Marys  Yeah we were pretty boring in Vegas actually  But I just want to know what happened in those missing hours of Anthony  Nah I don't know  They're called blackouts  They're called that for a reason  But you know what I think it's an interesting topic  It's a free speech topic  You know is there another standard for a cop  I think it's a pretty interesting issue  It's gonna be  I want to hear what happens on the other side 
[02:01:00]  And whether or not they say  Hey wait a minute this guy agreed when he became a cop  To conduct himself this way  They're trying to take his pension  I mean you think a guy should lose 22  Well I think they should just let him retire  Look if the cops union is worth anything  They'll get him his pension  And he could just move on and hit the comedy circuit  I guess if he wants  Yeah  Well this story has legs  Everyone's gonna find out what happens on this one  They're already talking about it on other radio  And he wasn't moonlighting by the way  He wasn't moonlighting  He wasn't making money from it 
[02:01:30]  So that they can't get him there  I'll tell you why he's not gonna be a sympathetic figure  Because anybody that jokes about rape or pedophilia  Is not gonna be liked  You're right but you know what  It shouldn't  Even though I know you're right  That shouldn't come into play  Because again as an actor  You can play any role you want  I don't remember anybody vilifying Pacino  For picking up a machine gun  And murdering people in Scarface  I know but people will look at it this way  Off-duty cop  Joking about pedophilia and rape  Now look I haven't heard it  So I can't judge it  And I think  You know I want to hear it 
[02:02:00]  Before I come to a conclusion on it  But off the top of my head  What's funny about rape and pedophilia  Doesn't matter  True but should the content of a stand-up act  Have a different set of standards  Than uh  My answer is yeah  I absolutely believe  You know  Look I think Opie and Anthony  Should be able to say  Basically whatever they want  On terrestrial radio  Never mind  Never mind satellite  With the exception of  Maybe you don't say the F word  Or maybe you don't say  You know a couple of words  I think for the most part  You guys ought to be able to say 
[02:02:30]  What you're saying on XM  Pretty much on terrestrial radio  Now a lot of my conservative friends  Don't agree with that  Right  But I ultimately believe  If they can silence you  Because they find your speech offensive  Then there's going to be a lot of people out there  That don't like the fact that  Sean Hannity's a conservative  Right  And Sean Hannity  You know speaks out in favor of candidates  During election cycles  Hey Sean this is nothing that  Isn't already happening  Oh it's happening  I mean  You're  You got a target on you  I got a big bullseye on my back  Yeah  Yes sir  Do you know with McCain-Feingold 
[02:03:00]  Most people don't know this  McCain-Feingold  Literally prohibits  American citizens  From uniting together  And creating ads  60 days outside of an election  For a primary  Or 30 days outside a general election  Let's say you get  Opie and Anthony and friends  And they want to run an ad  Against John Kerry in an election  You cannot now legally do it  Because the government said  Nope we're not going to let you  Because that's a donation  And that would impact the election  So in other words 
[02:03:30]  A group of American citizens  We're supposed to have free speech  You want to speak out with your friends  Against a particular political candidate  Legally now you're prohibited  From doing it  The next step is  They're going to look at  For example  Conservatives like Sean Hannity  Or Rush Limbaugh  Or local conservative hosts  And they're going to want to  Silence them next  Well is that a response  To the move on shenanigans  Of the last election  You know I actually think  It's a response to  The fact they think  We're effective  And that bothers them  And most politicians 
[02:04:00]  Desperately want their power  And that's why  They'll spend your money  To sort of buy your vote  Because that's what it is  If they build you a bridge  That you really want  And they bring bacon home  To your district  You're going to vote for them  You're going to buy your vote  Right  They say alright  Well he's giving me what I want  I'll give him what he wants  Wow we just want to be able  To run ads against Howard Stern  That's all  Is that still legal?  I don't know  Are you guys still fighting  You and Stern?  Holy shit  There's always stuff going on  It makes it fun every day  I gotta tell you 
[02:04:30]  Yeah  It's a lot of fun  To go down that road  Carve out our little niche  There's a lot of resentment there  Yeah just a tad  Well he had a gag order  Put on us  And he's  And then on his own show  He's yelling and screaming  About freedom of speech  And I should be able  To say whatever I want  I'm like oh my  Really?  Behind the scenes  Just shut us up  And we had no choice  You know what I never understood  And this was probably good for me  Because even though  We really weren't competitors  In New York  Yeah  You know you guys did siphon away  25% of all young men  Which were unavailable 
[02:05:00]  For anyone else  So I guess that's competition  Sean we kicked your ass  In the younger demos  You know that  I think Sean did  Just fine for himself  I had all the old people  You had the old people  We had the young people  And then the people in between  Were up for grabs  They were up for grabs  You've done just fine  Since we messed up our careers  You know what  I would like  I watch those numbers  You don't think I get frustrated  Don't come back  I watch those numbers  You don't think I get frustrated  I look at the Arbitron ratings  Every quarter 
[02:05:30]  And I go look where Sean is  We would have been right above him  You know  Actually at the end though  We really were fighting it out  It was like  We would win  And you would win  It was just going back and forth  But now no one's challenging you  And we've had some interesting calls lately  I think we might have to give you  A run for your money again Sean  Listen  You know what  You're  Beg us to stay on satellite  I'm not your ass  I lost you there  You don't want to get up in the afternoon 
[02:06:00]  Morning  You want to see the sunrise  Who needs this getting up at 5 every morning  What do you think of this new FM talker in town  Do you like it?  It's horrendous  I haven't listened to it  Well you know something  I love how Infinity decided to go with an FM talker  After losing two of their most high profile talk shows  Howard and ONA  Could you imagine if they would have put  Literally you guys on in the afternoon  And Howard on in the morning  What a force that would have been  K-Rock in New York would have been a powerhouse 
[02:06:30]  For some reason Howard didn't want that happening  Howard's ego got in the way  That's exactly what the company  How do you know it was him?  Huh?  How do you know it was him?  We had meetings about this Sean  They put us on the same stations as Howard in other markets  Because it wasn't in Howard's backyard  But when it came  They wanted to just throw us together  And Howard said absolutely not  His ego got in the way  Did not want us at the afternoon  That's exactly what they wanted  They didn't want to start a young talk station at WNEW  Without Howard being the morning show 
[02:07:00]  Everyone knew that was ridiculous  But they said we have no choice  We'll still try it this way  Do you know how many rumors there are  That one day XM and Sirius are going to unite?  Yeah but the government regulations  Won't allow it right now at least  You don't think?  No there has to be two satellite companies  In order to keep them from being a monopoly  Yeah I think someone's going to have to buy Sirius  And try to figure out that mess  And that is a mess over there  Yeah well anyway  You guys are doing pretty well  So I wouldn't complain 
[02:07:30]  What did you get your 7 million or 8 million sign up?  We're over 6 now  Over 6 mil  Yeah that's pretty good  When we started only 16 months ago  XM had like 2  A little over 2 million  Look I have it in my car  So that's how I knew you were in Vegas  And that's how I knew you had Danny Bonaduce on  And you didn't invite me on anymore  We love you Sean  Sean's on XM  Sean's got an open invite man  Yeah Sean's on XM 124  This story has legs with Club Soda Kenny  A couple things  You guys  You work in following up on the story

I have an E-Trade account  So every so often I hear  Like a jibber jabber  Nothing about XM  I'm not talking insider shit  I'm just talking you know  Eh I'll buy some American Airlines or something  And I'll buy that  And wait for it to go up a little  And then I'll off it  Nothing I hold on to long term  With the E-Trade account  That's like just kind of  Like a gambling account for me 
[02:12:30]  We hear things  And that's why I will never buy XM stock  And trade it  Because it's going to get you in trouble  That's too scary  It's too scary  It's too risky  You got to inform people I guess  If we wanted to buy stock  We would have to talk to people  And say you know  Our intentions are to buy so many shares  Blah blah blah  You can't just get on E-Trade  And go hey  I heard Oprah's signing on  Let me buy a few thousand shares  Hey all right  It's been announced  Hey look it's up two bucks  Sell sell sell 
[02:13:00]  And then you walk away and go  What?  What'd I do?  Yeah exactly  Wait that'd be wrong  That'd be wrong  Ask Martha Stewart  She'll tell you  I talked to a bunch of my friends  And sold them the information  All of a sudden  The bat phone is going off  In Spitzer's office  That's it  And you will be fucked  Yeah let's get Laura Corrin here  She's pacing  And we got Judah in studio as well  Do you own any stock there Judah?  No I'm pretty dumb  So I just 
[02:13:30]  You're one of it  Yeah  I don't know anything about stocks  I'm like up two bucks  I don't  I'm up like two bucks  But when you say up two bucks  I don't even know what that means  I guess that means it's good  Per share  Yeah  No one knows about the stock market  Even the experts don't know about the stock market  I just try to hold on to my money  Hello how have you been?  It's just another way to gamble with your money  Laura Corrin everyone in studio  It's so cool to see you guys  It's been a while  Oh my god  The Oprah thing is huge  Yes

[02:14:30]  I mean I know it's kind of annoying  It's still annoying  And the people would scream  Yeah  They'd go stop it with her laugh  Wait for the first laugh  Ladies and gentlemen  But that just was just some great times  So you've been watching our career  I have  And you know what though  Who made phone calls for you?  You don't even remember this do you?  No I don't know  You don't remember when I used to  I used to leave your station  And this is when I was doing a thousand  I mean I did a thousand radio shows  Right  I'd pick up the phone  And start calling management  And talk about these guys 
[02:15:00]  In Worcester, Mass  I mean you know  Are you trying to take credit  For our huge success?  Yes  Are you insane?  Just a little bit  Are you crazy?

Yeah we're in Canada too  Not counting the internet  Yes  Not counting the internet  Which is you know  A bunch of countries  Right  Yeah it's something about  Coming in here after  Listening to Sean Hannity  And wanting to talk about 
[02:15:30]  You know  Popping her clutch  And  We're actually very popular  And the three eyed turtle position  I'm just like  Wait a minute  That's the beauty of the show  We go from politics to sex  And we got Judah  You didn't even say hi to Judah  We did  Very famous comedian  Yeah  I asked him if he knew  My ex-husband  Barry Marder  Who's Seinfeld's best friend  Yeah I don't know Barry  Do you know Barry Norton?

He's a good writer  But he stinks under the sheets  You helped him  Right  Well you know  In all honesty  He couldn't get me off  But I  You know  I knew how to get myself off  But  Of course  I failed to tell him how to do it  So who's the fault?  Who was the idiot?  It was me  What do you think was wrong?  You think when he was going down on you  He was thinking  What would Jerry do? 
[02:16:30]  And there's the laugh  You know  You ever notice  You ever notice  That's just funny  Who are these  Well you know  He  He probably is pretty good and bad  But you know  I didn't tell him how to get myself off  Which by the way  A lot of women don't tell  Laura's about you know  Being open and honest  And if something feels good  You should tell the person  And that way they'll do it  Absolutely  Show them the right way  To get around those  Little areas 
[02:17:00]  So how are you guys doing  In the love department?  We're doing good  You know I got  Come on  Come on  What's going on?  Good socks?  You got a nice squeeze?  What's going on?

[02:17:30]  That's so funny  And you?  We're doing just fine  When I saw you last  You were with  You're not with the same chick  Sorry  I'm with the same girl  Yeah  Same girl  But not the girl  That you were with  For years and years  No not my ex-wife  Oh that's right  He'll talk about his ex-wife  It's been a long time  Don't even bring up the ex  Leave  But didn't she have my book?  Didn't she  You know  Didn't one of the girls  Have your book?  Yeah  Yeah the ex  I think  The ex  Hit him over the head  Yeah  Hit me over the head with it 
[02:18:00]  It took half his money  And then used it as a coaster  For a Jack Daniels and Coke  Right  Yeah thanks Laura  Well you know  It is a pretty big book  Yeah  I'm still talking about this book  Come One Night's a Great Sex  That was the one where  You know  It was that book  You got her  It was the one where you  Peel out the pages  I just happened to have one with me  And she actually  It gave her a good training  For the photo album  Because she did the same thing with that  Through every page in the fireplace  Well I got to tell you  The book is a publishing phenomenon 
[02:18:30]  Yes  It still is  I have the 2006 edition  Because basically chicks dig it  I mean I just keep getting  More ideas  More sex tricks  And putting them in the book  But 101 Nights of Great Sex  Is what they call  A publishing phenomenon  Or millions  I know a good sex trick  Yeah by the way  I know a good sex trick  Millions of books sold  Jimmy  This is a sex trick  What I do is  While she's not looking  I slip something into her beverage  And when she passes out  Face first in the pillow  I stick it in  And when she wakes up  I go  Ta da 
[02:19:00]  It's a magician  You know  I thought  What should I  There you go  What is that  No the book is really unusual  For your audience  They've never heard of the book  Are any of the books  On like audio  The pages are sealed  Are any of them audio books  Yeah  Actually  Because I can't read  No the pages are sealed  There are 101 secret sealed envelopes  Are there horny pictures in there  Or anything  Actually no  No pictures  See what you do is 
[02:19:30]  Yeah  See the pages are sealed  Yeah  How do you  They will be  I'm done reading it  LOL  Re-seal it up  And the concept is  There's 50 sealed envelopes  For his eyes only  And 50 for her eyes only  Yeah  And one for the end  Can I tell you something  Missions  I'd probably be naughty  And peek at the ones  I shouldn't  Yes  And the concept is  It's not a book you read  Which you guys  Would probably like that  Yeah  It's a book you do  Yeah  And chicks just really dig it  Because once you rip out  A sealed envelope 
[02:20:00]  And each sealed envelope  Has a title  And I thought it would be  Kind of fun to have  To play what's inside  The sealed envelope  Oh  Like I throw out  The name of the seduction  I give you a couple of hints  And then you try to  And you try to guess  What the technique is  Because there's  Little scenarios  That take place  In these things  Right  Something the girl  Would have to do  Exactly  To entice the guy  In  Something the guy  Would have to do  Items involved  Yeah  Yeah there's a technique  In every sealed envelope  A technique  But the cool thing 
[02:20:30]  About why this is  A great gift  For Valentine's Day  Because you know  I am here  For Valentine's Day  Of course  Right around the corner  It's because you might  As well give her a gift  That keeps on giving  That you get something  In return right  Yes  Which is sex  Exactly  And more sex  Right  So I want to teach  Our audience some techniques  Ooh  And do you  There's a sealed envelope  For his eyes only  Called popping her clutch  Popping her clutch  That is the name  And this actually  I think I'm going to  Learn how to read 
[02:21:00]  I'm going to take a class  This book sounds great  All right  Popping her clutch  It's a for his eyes only page  And here's your hint  Okay  It extends her orgasm  Hers  Her orgasm  All right  Who cares  Now  What's the next chapter  Really  You want one for her  To do for him  Popping her clutch  No it's a really cool thing  That you can do  Okay  It extends her orgasm  It extends her orgasm  And it involves batteries  Batteries 
[02:21:30]  Yeah  Okay  If she doesn't listen  Hit her  Popping the bitch  Oh she said batteries  All right  And this actually works  All right  Opie  You had your hands up  I already know this one  Oh you do  I'm a cheater  I know this one  Okay well what is it  Is this to keep  All right  Well you use a vibrator  Right  Yeah  Right  And just like  When she's getting close  To having the big O  Yeah  God he's so good  You either 
[02:22:00]  Slow down the speed  Or turn off the vibrator  Completely  Make her wait  Make her wait a little bit  The anticipation  Will drive her nuts  And then you turn it back on  Back on  And she can't handle it anymore  Which is like  Dumping the clutch there  Popping the clutch  That's right  All sounds like  And the car goes like  Kind of lunges forward  Yeah  That's good  And then she stalls  And you gotta push her  The rest of the way  And then you look back  Over the owner's manual  And the history  And you realize  Some black guy  Was driving your car  No wonder the seat 
[02:22:30]  Is so big  Yeah  Well you know  Opie  When she's right  At the top of her orgasm  What you do  Is you  When she's right at  When she  First goes over  Right  You stop  Then you put it back on  Then you stop  Then you put it back on  And you can actually  You know  Make her come for about  20 seconds that way  So yeah  Is this kind of the same thing  I do the same thing  Where I'll kind of stop  When they're getting close  But I just use my mouth  I don't use equipment  And then like  As she's going over  I just burst into tears 
[02:23:00]  You're strange  Aren't you  Can you tell  I hate setting up Jimmy  I will write down  I like the car  I like the car motif thing  Though that you have there  You do  Yeah  I like one in the tailpipe  Is that one of the techniques  Is that in my book  Give her one in the tailpipe  How about blown gasket  And my name is gasket  Can we do that  If we're sticking with  A car oriented  Theme here  That's pretty good 
[02:23:30]  That's pretty good  All right  Jimmy has something  For you on that though  Okay  There's also this  Really cool thing  But she didn't listen to me  Wait wait wait  Yes Jimmy  Really really cool thing  That  She's still  Nothing  All right  We'll work it in  Later on  Go ahead  Laura Korn everyone  That's bad body language  You're giving me  That's not very loving  She's looking away from me  Oh oh oh  I wasn't staring at your breasts  Oh  No it's odd  Because Laura sits  In a chair  She can't just sit in the chair  Which is fine  You sit in the chair  The same way this girl

[02:47:30]  That will actually stimulate  About 3,000 of her nerve endings  Because the clitoris has about 4,000  And most guys aren't in this position  And most of these nerve endings  Never get any stimulation  Probably on top of her facing down  So your chin is hitting her clit  Uh uh  Okay  How about while she's on her stomach  Licking her kind of a clit  And her lips from the back  While she's on her stomach  Yes  Licking her lips from the back  Absolutely  Fantastic  And you get the ass in your face  Really  And you get the ass in your face  Yeah that's called bonus

[03:13:00]  Scene in that movie  Describe it  It could be  It might be even  Taboo with Kay Parker  It's about incest  Favorite scene  I don't know  There's so many  So many  It might be  There's a moment  Where it's like  The original movie  The lady fucks her son  And in the second movie  The lady works  It's hotter and hotter  Doesn't it  No the lady works  The lady works  In a card shop  So the son's ex-girlfriend  Comes in with her brother  And he's  Oh where's Paul  We haven't seen him 
[03:13:30]  And if you've seen  The first one  You know that  She was fucking her son  So he moved away  So the girl goes  To buy a card  And the mother  Who was  Let's see  The mother  Who used  The boyfriend  That this girl used to date  Is looking at  This girl's brother  And she glances down  At his cock  And she kind of  Subtly remarks on it  And that's probably  My favorite scene  It's that fast  It's not an incest moment  It's her looking  At a guy's  Right  But it's like  Which we all do  By the way  That to me  Was my favorite 
[03:14:00]  No  To me it was  The sexiest  There's a porno movie  And the part where  Everyone's clothes are on  And they're in a card store  Is the hottest part  Of the fucking movie  No because then he goes  He was friends with her son  He goes  Look I was friends with Paul  Maybe I could bring  Some tools by  I borrowed something  Can I return it to you  And to watch her  Giving in and realizing  This guy's gonna come over  And fuck me  And then she gives her a dress  That was the sexiest part  That scene  Is he hard?

[03:23:30]  I have bounced people for IMing me  Which I do all the time  That's one issue  But this one  Anytime we have a woman as a guest on here  Some of the idiot ass wipes  Immediately just say  Oh hole  Oh they got a hole on today  The hole  A hole is a co-host of a radio show  That comes in on a daily basis  And interrupts what the guys are talking about  In a way that takes away from the conversation 
[03:24:00]  Like oh guys  Enough of that  We've described it in the past  If you can't pick up that concept  Stop listening  And Laura was great  I mean she didn't get offended at anything  She's exactly the type of female guest you want  Because now you want to go out and buy her book  Because you're like  Alright she's cool about sex  She's not a baby  She was great  Some of these sex experts  Take themselves so seriously  And she's fun about it  Yeah she's a great straight man  She's hot  Yeah yeah  She's a great set up person man  Yeah  I'll give you the cackle laugh people  I'll give you the cackle laugh  We acknowledge it's a little rough  But we've acknowledged that for you know 10 years now 
[03:24:30]  Ever since we met her  But you should see her breast implants  So  Lovely  What a body  I wouldn't mind taking her out for a malted  You know maybe a beverage with two straws  Nice way to get the romance going  Absolutely  Hey there's a story about a cop that got fired  For peeping with his dash cam  This is a great story  And this is the difference between  What we talked about with Kenny  Right  But this is a guy who's on duty  Doing something with the dash cam  I wonder what the dash cam story was 
[03:25:00]  I thought it was just a guy with a cam on his dash  But it's the cop  The ones you see on cops all the time  Yeah  They use that dash cam  And they record chases and that shit  Yeah he was real smart  What was he doing with the cam?  Here it is  Dashboard cameras  They let us see high speed chases  And the dramatic and dangerous world of daily policing  On fire sir  And now this  These images were shot from a patrol car in Martin County, Florida  By a sheriff's deputy while he was on duty patrolling Jensen Beach  The video shot last year of women in bikinis 
[03:25:30]  Some who likely thought they were out of view while taking a beachside shower  Led to an internal investigation and departmental charges of intentional abuse of authority  And willful neglect of duties  This week the deputy Jack Muncy was fired  Although police said his actions were not illegal  There's nothing criminal about looking at girls, no  However, there's ethical and moral issues here that the sheriff would not allow  When asked why he taped the women  Munson reportedly told investigators  They were pretty  Still the incident has proven ugly for the sheriff's office 
[03:26:00]  And it's not over  Munson has just filed for a hearing to contest his dismissal  This guy  I'm Jack Munson  Right  What does he expect?  You can't do that  Like you're on duty filming chicks' tits  Dude, that's stupid  Through the cop camera  What do you think?  No one's gonna see that?  Yeah  Outdoor showers at the beach  He just turns his couch  Nice  At least he had an intellectual answer  They're pretty  They're pretty 
[03:26:30]  They're pretty  You're pretty  I'll take a picture with you  What an ass  That is stupid  That is pretty cool though  I mean, you gotta admit it  Oh yeah, it's fantastic to do it  I'm all for Mr. Munson  Girls Gone Wild  On cop cam  What a nerd too  He films them showering  Like with clothes on  Can't you fucking  You know, you have access to all these windows and stuff, man  Peep in someone's window  It's like an 80s movie, man  The shower scene 
[03:27:00]  There's no shower scenes in movies anymore  No  Porky's  Every 80s movie had it  Every single one  Yeah  They took all that away from us  It's done  They took it all away from us  Bullshit  I saw Porky's recently  In that scene where they're looking in  Yeah  And you can see the big  I didn't think that  The big hairy muffs carried over into the 80s like they did  Oh, they did, yeah  But my God, didn't they?  There's all those girls standing there  And you're just seeing big hairy muffs  I think it was like late 80s, early 90s when that  Yeah, they started shaving  Shaving it out 
[03:27:30]  Yeah  Jeez  What magazine had Bush  Hustler  Hustler, yeah  Hustler, Bush over the  Over the years  Over the years or whatever  Went from the 60s, I think  Oh, really?
