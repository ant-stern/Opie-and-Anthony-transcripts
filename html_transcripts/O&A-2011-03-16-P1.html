<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a self-deprecating introduction acknowledging their controversial reputation.  The hosts then speculated about a possible month-long delay in New York City's seasonal weather patterns.  Opie recounted his experience at an Allman Brothers Band concert, detailing the band's age, lengthy jam sessions, and the presence of notable figures like Steve Leitz and Danny Goldberg. This led to a broader discussion about the longevity of bands and whether a band's name should change after all original members depart.

The conversation abruptly shifted to critical commentary on the media's coverage of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, contrasting what they perceived as sensationalized reporting with the technical expertise needed for accurate discussion.  They compared this to the Chernobyl disaster and watched a documentary about Chernobyl concurrently with live news coverage of Fukushima.  A caller, a licensed nuclear reactor operator, offered a more technical perspective, countering the media's portrayal of the events.  The hosts continued to criticize the media's prioritization of ratings over accuracy, citing Gilbert Gottfried's firing for jokes about the tsunami as an example of the media’s hypocrisy.  They also criticized Obama's perceived lack of leadership in the Libyan crisis.  The segment ended with a caller whose audio cut out, leaving only screaming sounds.

The next segment started with a discussion of March Madness brackets, transitioning into a profane rant about Charlie Sheen’s internship program and the show's own frustrating intern application process, blaming "Scar Greenstein" and other higher-ups.  This segued back to the Fukushima disaster, with a caller, JR (a former Navy reactor operator), providing expert commentary and comparing it to Chernobyl, including graphic details and inappropriate humor.  The hosts discussed various news personalities' coverage (Wolf Blitzer, Shepard Smith, Soledad O'Brien), speculated on the disaster's long-term effects, and compared societal responses to disasters in Japan, Haiti, and after Hurricane Katrina, again using graphic descriptions. A heated exchange with a caller followed regarding Anthony's past statements about letting "savages kill themselves" in Libya.  The segment concluded with further criticism of television news anchors and a lengthy, highly offensive rant about city ordinances and revenue-generating schemes (speed cameras, red-light cameras, bike lane tickets, a Nassau County "leisure pass").  Don Henley's "Dirty Laundry" was played, and Nate Dogg's death was briefly mentioned.

The following segment began with cynical commentary on city practices, including allegations about shortened yellow lights and parking meters sold to a company possibly connected to the Russian mafia. A caller from Boston recounted a story about six months' worth of revoked parking tickets due to the death of the person reviewing camera footage.  The discussion shifted to documentaries, specifically the Bill Hicks documentary and the Ken Burns effect.  A George Carlin bit about enjoying excess and natural disasters was played, followed by a segment on NYC's red-light cameras featuring Kenny, a former law enforcement officer, who provided statistics on its profitability but expressed concern about the lack of transparency regarding revenue usage.  The hosts then lamented their lack of interns, attributing it to a past incident.  Other topics included the "Harry Balls" municipal building naming controversy, Charlie Sheen's tweets and relationship with Brie Olson (including a discussion of "coke dick" and "whiskey dick"), a debunked story about paying a credit card bill with pennies, and a detailed analysis of Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino's disastrous performance at the Donald Trump roast, with clips played.  The segment concluded with a discussion about the end of the US Space Shuttle program and reliance on Russia for space travel.

A phone call with Ian Halperin and two women he called his "goddesses" dominated the next segment.  The conversation began with space exploration skepticism, then transitioned to Halperin promoting his movie.  The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive and offensive banter with the women, focusing on their appearances, sexual experiences with Halperin, and their professions, frequently commenting on their accents. The conversation became confrontational, with insults and name-calling on both sides. Halperin promised pictures with himself, the women, and Geraldo Rivera, but technical difficulties ensued.  The segment concluded with the hosts examining the pictures and continuing their sexually charged and insulting commentary, persistently attempting to elicit sexually explicit details from the women.

The final segment featured another phone call with two women, opening with Opie making crude comments about their appearances and initiating a "good cop/bad cop" routine with Anthony.  Opie continued with sexually suggestive and insulting remarks, referencing a picture they sent.  The hosts complained about the women's talking and lack of airtime for other segments, criticizing their breath and perceived lack of attractiveness. The segment ended abruptly with the hosts expressing frustration and discussing future segments, including a Nate Dogg tribute and a "racist rant," and the need to make up 20 minutes of airtime owed to listeners.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee.  There we go.  Nice rainy day in New York City.  Good morning to everybody.  Yeah, but it's going to warm up later.  Thank God.  That's nice.  Hopefully we've gone through this whole winter thing.  I guess spring is, what, next week? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Don't I hear?  And the winter thing went away weeks ago.  Yeah.  We had a horrible start to winter and then nothing.  And it just kind of went away.  Kind of went away about a month, month and a half ago.  Yeah.  Snow went away.  But, man, from Christmas to what?  Valentine's Day, maybe?  Yeah, yeah.  I think even before that, it was horrible around here.  It was brutality.  It just went away.  Cold snow.  And now it's, you know, you get the rain.  The rain.  These are the April showers that bring May flowers, but it's not April yet. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, but I noticed a while ago, that whole thing has shifted a whole month.  Yeah, yeah.  Shipped it back.  April showers is now May showers in our area.  March.  March showers?  March, April, May.  It was always April showers bring May flowers, but now it's May flowers bring June.  Wait.  Now it's May showers bring June flowers.  I'm telling you.  Oh, it shifted that way.  It shifted a whole month, but no one's paying attention to that.  I am.  It doesn't really rain in April anymore.  The rain starts in May. 
[00:02:30]  There's been a shift of a complete month somewhere.  Like forward or back?  Because, like, I thought it was March it starts raining a lot.  Yeah, but March.  March showers bring April flowers.  You're right.  March.  The March rain, though, is supposed to be snow.  Snow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then it's too warm for snow, so it is raining.  You're right.  And then for some weird reason, the April month doesn't rain anymore.  No.  And then the rain starts in May, I'm telling you.  In May.  And then.  So we got to adjust that rhyme.  And then you get the flowers in early June. 
[00:03:00]  What about in like a lion, out like a lamb?  No, that's not happening.  Is that July now?  Um, how does that work now?  I don't know.  All that weather stuff is getting like magazine deliveries.  March starts like a lamb now.  Yeah, March.  In the New York area.  March is a lamb.  Or just slightly into March.  I'm telling you, there's been a whole shift.  Yeah.  But no one's paying attention.  Something's happened.  Yeah, what do you think?  It's harp.  It's harp.  The harp unit. 
[00:03:30]  It's a conspiracy.  Yeah, I spent most of the night just watching the news.  Yeah.  See what's going on with the Japan and the nukes and that.  And at the same time, though, I had, because you hear so much and then they just start repeating  themselves.  Sure.  So I have the news on, but with the volume turned down.  So just in case you see a special new alert.  And then while that was on, I had on my computer a documentary of Chernobyl. 
[00:04:00]  Well, what's wrong with you?  So I was just nuking out last night.  I'm nuking out.  We did the complete opposite.  Really?  Yeah.  I became a hippie last night.  A hippie man.  You turn off the news and go to an Allman Brothers show.  Oh, the world is fine?  There's nothing wrong with the world.  Matter of fact, you feel like you're still in the 70s.  Really?  Yeah.  Where were the Allmans playing?  Oh, my God.  You know.  Beacon Theater.  Oh, Beacon?  Every year.  Eight billion nights at the Beacon?  Yeah, every year they camp out at the Beacon Theater for the whole bunch of March. 
[00:04:30]  Jesus.  They just camp out and play night after night.  And is it fucking sold out like every night?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I tweeted a picture and everyone beat the shit out of me, which is fine.  I guess you have to because it's the Allman Brothers.  They're like, are you sitting in one of the wheelchairs they provide for the old people?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But honestly, the crowd is a mix.  There's definitely some old guys, but there's definitely a lot of young people checking out 
[00:05:00]  the Allman Brothers.  Some young bucks.  Well, because they're in that jam band category.  Yeah, yeah.  And Greg Allman, I was telling you before the show, he just sits at his ancient keyboard.  Someone way better than me could tell me exactly what he's playing.  Hasn't upgraded.  But he hasn't changed shit.  Yeah.  And he sits in like an antique chair that doesn't even look comfortable.  Really?  Something you would see in your grandma's house.  Is it wood?  Yeah.  It's an old wood chair.  Everything is just wood. 
[00:05:30]  You're right.  And then he just jams.  He's been doing this for, what, 40 years?  Yeah, that makes sense.  The Hammond B3.  Thank you.  Thank you, yes.  Probably with the Leslie cabinets.  That's what I was telling you.  The spinny things.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the spinny things?  That gives you that sound of the Allman Brothers, that kind of weird sound.  When the speakers spin, it gives you the Doppler effect.  My seats were on the stage, so I was looking at the spinny things.  The spinny things?  Behind Greg Allman.  Yeah, really. 
[00:06:00]  That's the classic old sound that they have a hard time actually really digitizing.  Really?  Because it's so mechanical.  Yeah.  And he drinks out of a red cup, whatever he's drinking these days.  I don't even know.  It could just be tea with honey.  I don't know.  Damn, man.  He could still sing.  He hasn't lost shit.  Really?  I'm telling you.  He hasn't lost shit in his voice.  And then he's got a bunch of young bucks that do all the heavy lifting, as we like to say a lot on this show.  They bring in the young guys to do that, the heavy lifting. 
[00:06:30]  The old guys just kind of sit back.  Well, I believe there's three original members.  You've got Greg Allman, and then you've got two guys on percussion.  There's three percussionists.  Oh, really?  And the main one now is, I didn't realize how short he was until the first set was over, and he walked by me, and I had to look way the fuck down at him.  Oh, really?  And I'm not that tall.  A real short guy that could beat the shit out of the skins.  And then you've got the two older guys that have been around forever that's still one black guy.  He's so old, he's starting to look white. 
[00:07:00]  He's one of those black guys.  Oh, right, right, yeah.  They lose their racial identity.  And he's such a big, meaty guy that his drumsticks look like baseball bats.  Oh, really?  The really big, thick ones?  The thick fucking drumsticks?  But, man, they don't miss a fucking beat.  Really?  Does Greg look old?  Does he still have the long hair?  Is it gray?  You know, I've been going to the Allman Brothers off and on for years, and he hasn't aged in probably the last ten. 
[00:07:30]  Really?  He got to where he was, and then the last ten years, he's pretty much staying the same, which is kind of creepy.  Yeah.  I don't know if he had some face work done or what, but I saw him up close because he kept walking off the stage when they went into, like, a 15-minute jam.  Oh, okay.  So he took a break at the side of the stage, you know.  A 15-minute jam, though?  Look, I love the Allmans, but oh, boy.  I only got to the first set, which started around 8.15, 8.20, and ended at 10.15.  So the first set was about two hours long, maybe a little less. 
[00:08:00]  First set.  And then I'm like, I tweeted.  Wait a minute.  I tweeted, I got to go home, and then I had to read how much of a pussy I am, and blah, blah, blah.  I'd kill for those seeds.  I can't believe you're fucking leaving.  And I'm like, look, man, 5 a.m. comes very fucking quickly.  Yeah, and God knows how long they'll go.  Well, the problem is they, because I know from past years, they take a nice long break.  Oh, do they?  Let everyone get their beers and stuff, and these guys go backstage for a solid half hour, I think.  Easy.  Oh, God.  And then I'm thinking, well, now that's going to be close to 11. 
[00:08:30]  I can't do what Ant does.  I can't do the stay up all night and come in here.  It's impossible for me.  The early nap.  Yeah.  And then he's got Derek Trucks, who's an amazing guitarist.  Warren Haynes, an amazing guitarist and vocalist who sings a lot of the songs now.  And then another guy up there, I don't know his name.  And they just fucking three guys, you know, just jamming.  What do you think?  Do you think Dickie Betts is just beating his fucking chick in the face when this is all going on? 
[00:09:00]  Like, damn it, I could still be part of this if I wasn't beating my chick in the face.  He still could do it, so he must be a real asshole that they don't want to work with him.  Yeah.  He's legendary.  But Warren Haynes is just ridiculous.  Absolutely ridiculous.  Vocals sounded good, though, and everything.  Amazing.  You know, I know the Allman Brothers isn't for everyone, but I've always liked them, and they're still doing it.  And they're going to do it for a real long time to come.  Well, I mean, when Greg Allman moves on, whether he finally stops or whatever, they're going to continue somehow. 
[00:09:30]  Don't you need an Allman in the Allman Brothers?  Well, it goes with what we've been saying for years.  Eventually, these bands become franchises, and you don't need the original guys anymore.  But it's one thing to have the original guys in a band that isn't named after them.  If you go to see the Allman Brothers, by the way, it's just one Allman now.  Right.  Well, it's been one Allman for a very long time.  Yeah, for a long time.  We lost Dwayne in that motorcycle accident how long ago? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Somewhere in the 70s, right?  So it's like, if there's no Allmans, are you really going to see the Allman Brothers?  Well, there's other bands out there.  You could ask the same question.  Like Van Halen, without a Van Halen, would be very odd.  Right.  But Van Halen...  Name-wise, I mean, it seems like you'd have to change the name.  But Van Halen continued being huge after the main fucking vocalist was gone.  Yeah, but it was still Van Halen. 
[00:10:30]  Like, I'm trying to think if there was a name band where the name is no longer with the band.  I think it doesn't matter anymore to the people out there.  Yeah?  Yeah, I really do.  I mean, maybe a change to where it's like, I don't know, the Allman Brothers band, but  you had a word, so everyone knows there's no Allman Brothers anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Or no original members.  But see, Warren Haynes has been singing the Dickie Bette songs and other songs for so  long, he's kind of becoming the voice of the Allman Brothers, between Greg Allman trading 
[00:11:00]  off on songs.  He should legally change his last name to Allman.  There you go.  See, that's what the young bucks got to do that are in the band.  See, we've done this bit a lot, but here you go.  Kevin from Connecticut.  The Temptations have no original members.  Right, we know that.  And they're still touring.  But it wasn't like a guy named Bob Temptation.  I see what you're saying.  Yeah, it's just weird.  It's weirder to have the name of the guy as the band.  But I think it's easier for kind of a jam band to slowly but surely replace players and 
[00:11:30]  continue.  Yeah.  Like, I heard Jessica for, they did Jessica for 20 minutes, and most of the guys, here  you go, and most of the guys that were playing on that stage had nothing to do with this  song when it first came out.  But it sounded exactly like this.  So, I don't know.  So, it doesn't matter.  I don't know.  I think.  Was this like, woo, when this started off?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Woo, yeah, Allman Brothers. 
[00:12:00]  Fuck yeah.  I think the replacement guys have been around so long that it's starting to not matter.  Doesn't matter.  That's what it comes down to.  They're becoming the Allman Brothers.  Yeah.  There you go.  How about if Greg moves on, retires, whatever happens to him.  You just call him the New Allman Brothers.  The New Allman Brothers.  And then everyone knows, okay, there's no Allman Brothers in this band.  They're the New Allman Brothers.  All right.  Keeping the tradition and the music alive, man.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, only time will tell, but we've been talking about this for a very long time. 
[00:12:30]  These bands are just going to be franchises.  And the original members that go, look, I don't want to fucking play anymore.  All right.  You go fucking enjoy your retirement.  We'll give you a piece of the action.  And we're going to continue out there as the New Allman Brothers.  Look at Leonard Skinner.  They're saying no original members of Leonard Skinner at this point.  Yeah.  But their name wasn't Leonard Skinner.  But they got the brother of the main guy singing.  They got the brother.  So that helps that, right? 
[00:13:00]  That would be like, okay, say you got a wacky morning show and it's called like Morning Coffee.  You could throw anyone in that, you know?  But then you got the Opie and Anthony show.  Now, like we leave, but the show continues with like Sam Roberts or something.  Hey, man.  I'll take a piece of that.  But then it's like the Opie and Anthony show, but it would seem weirder than having a morning show without a name in it.  And then like our names and it just keeps going.  But we have nothing to do with it. 
[00:13:30]  And the tradition of what we built, we get people to replace our voices.  We go enjoy our retirement.  We get a piece of the action.  Why not?  Let's franchise.  All right.  Franchise.  Sam Roberts.  When you're eating a McDonald's burger, you're not eating a McDonald's burger from the original guy that invented the whole thing.  No.  Ray Kroc.  But it sure is tasty still, right?  That's right.  Someone's saying Foreigner has one original band member left.  And that's not the vocalist. 
[00:14:00]  I don't think it's the lead guy either.  And I talked to someone that saw Foreigner recently and said they were amazing.  And I brought that up.  I'm like, but Luke Graham's not singing for Foreigner anymore.  They're cover bands.  They're cover bands.  They're tribute bands, cover bands.  But they got the name legally.  But they were able to get the name.  I'm telling you, these bands move on without any original members.  You're going to see more and more of this as time goes on.  Well, good for them.  Was it a lot of jamming?  A lot of like... 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, I know you hate that.  That's why I'm trying to not talk about it.  No, no, it's cool.  I mean, I like the Allman Brothers.  I like their hits.  You know, I'm a hits guy.  Right.  So I like their hits and stuff.  But if this shit...  And I like this song.  This song was about 20 minutes long last night.  See, if this goes on for 20 minutes, I start getting a little jittery in my seat.  I'm guessing.  But it builds.  Come on.  It just keeps building and building and building and building.  I'm just like, come on.  Whipping Post.  Where are you doing?  You're wasting Whipping Post time.  You could... 
[00:15:00]  You could...  The problem with Whipping Post, that song could be up to 40 minutes long.  Oh, I know.  But I just want to hear Radio Whipping Post and then go to Radio Other Songs.  They don't do radio songs.  Oh, you're a radio song.  No, they do extended fucking mixes.  Any solo stuff?  Did you hear I'm No Angel?  Any solo stuff?  Did you hear I'm No Angel?  Oh, Greg Allman's solo stuff.  No.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I didn't mean like solo.  Those must have just gone on for hours.  It's like, no, it's your turn.  No, you take this one for a while.  Oh, God. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  And then they just walk up to the edge of the stage and it's like, goes forever?  Dude, effortless.  But if you appreciate guitar playing, between Warren Haynes and Dirk Trucks, ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  I can understand that.  Ridiculous.  Just sit there.  Did I smoke any pot?  No, but I think I got a contact buzz last night.  You got to.  In that place?  I believe they're just openly allowing pot smoking at the Beacon Theater this month.  I want to thank the guy that gave us actual seats on the stage.  Because I get to sneak back there because I asked for tickets last minute, so I always 
[00:16:00]  get kind of side stage shit.  Yeah.  But I went with Steve Leitz.  Oh, yeah.  Who basically came up with Zeppelin.  We talk about him every once in a while.  He's a legendary record guy that now works at SiriusXM.  Yeah.  So he calls me, goes, you want to go?  I'm like, fuck yeah.  Holy shit.  The whole world knows this guy.  Oh, yeah.  We're sitting in the front row of these seats that they just put on the side of the stage.  Wow, that's cool.  And there's only like maybe 12 seats, tops. 
[00:16:30]  So you like sitting right there watching them at stage level and shit?  Yeah, sitting next to Danny Goldberg.  Really?  The Danny Goldberg.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Damn.  And then one of the Hilfigers was behind me.  A Hilfiger?  Not the main Hilfiger, but...  There was a Hilfiger.  A Hilfiger that also does a little of that fashion stuff.  Look at that.  Good seats.  Yeah, it was a good time.  I like doing that every year.  I want to go to a couple more shows, though, because every show is different.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  They have musical guests. 
[00:17:00]  Yesterday, they had Steve Earle.  Steve Earle?  I don't know much about Steve Earle, but I hear he works here at SiriusXM.  Really?  Yeah.  What does he do?  I don't know.  They appreciated him when they announced him, so I guess he does something.  I guess he does something.  No, I've heard the name, but I couldn't tell you one Steve Earle song.  But he sang Knocking on Heaven's Door with the guys.  Oh, okay.  Which was kind of cool.  That's pretty cool, definitely.  So, boom, boom, boom.  Sounds fun.  We just talked for ten minutes, and this song is only half over. 
[00:17:30]  I know, right?  Holy shit.  We get it.  You play long songs.  See, I can't.  That's why I was never into the dead and things like that.  It just goes on.  Kevin from Connecticut.  In Skinner, only Gary Rossington remains with the band as of 2011.  Wow.  So, they're down to one guy.  One guy.  And they're touring and selling out everywhere.  Right.  And sounding more like Skinner than ever.  And now you lose Rossington.  What?  You think the band's going to shut down?  Hell fucking no.  No, keep going.  They'll just put new in front of the name, I'm telling you. 
[00:18:00]  Or some other word like that.  Amazing.  Because I guess legally they would have to do something like that, right?  I don't know.  Unless there's some kind of estate that allows them to buy it or something.  I like The Grateful Dead as well, but not as much as Skinner.  Yeah.  The Skinner, this stuff I always was into.  I don't know.  This is too jammy for me.  Yeah.  Too jammy.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  So, anyway, I did that.  And it was a good time.  Talking about the Japanese coverage, the one observation I have today is how everyone's  becoming an expert on nuclear power plants.  Yes, everybody.  And once again, I hate to use the word, but I really don't want to give them any respect  whatsoever, but it's the broads are now nuclear power plant experts.  They're all experts in nuclear power.  And I'm looking at them like, you had a curl iron in your hair a mere 10 minutes ago, and 
[00:19:00]  now you're an expert on nuclear power plants?  Curling iron gets hot.  When did you learn about this?  I don't know.  It is ridiculous.  Because you know they have no clue and barely know more than the average person watching.  Yeah.  But because they're on TV, now they have to make it look like they're experts on it.  Yeah.  And it drives me nuts.  Like I said, I want the guy with the, with the, with the, you know, the bed head and  the holy shit look on his face. 
[00:19:30]  Like, this is some bad shit I got to talk to you about.  Suits all askew.  Right.  It's just a wreck.  And now CNN's doing something at the top of the hour where they have, I hate to say it,  but I'll say it again.  The broad walking sideways looking at the camera, talking about all the stuff that's happening  in the world.  They're doing this weird.  You haven't seen it yet at the top of the hour?  No, I haven't seen that.  She walks sideways as she's, as she's, as she's looking at the camera and gives a whole  list of holy shit things that are happening in the world.  Why does she have to be walking? 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  And she's in the newsroom and then they like flash on to screen CNN and breaking news and  this, but it's actually looking at like a monitors.  Yeah.  It was the weirdest thing I saw yesterday.  So I, I mean, when they're talking about the nuclear power plant, I want the fucking weirdos  that they do bring on these nuclear physicists with the gray hair.  And you can tell they, they are just weirdos.  Well, they're not talking about a nuclear shit.  Kaku has been on a lot of shows and mostly GMA.  I think GMA fucking, they got him. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Cause I don't see him on CNN or Fox or anywhere else.  He was like yelling.  Well, you have to do the Chernobyl, what they did in Chernobyl, dropping sandbags on top of  this, we have to do like, he's all mad.  Really?  Yeah.  He's very angry because he doesn't understand why no one's doing anything.  Why are they pulling the people out of the power plant?  Sacrifice those fuckers.  Oh, you think they should be sacrificial lambs?  Yeah.  Someone pointed gun at him and go, look, you can't leave this power plant.  We need you. 
[00:21:00]  You have to sacrifice for your countrymen.  We'll take care of your families.  Don't worry about it.  But you guys have, have been chosen to fucking take care of this situation for everyone.  That's exactly what Chernobyl did, by the way.  I was watching that documentary.  They just sent people in and it's like, sorry, let her rip.  You're in, you're up, go.  No kidding.  And they just sent him in.  They were dying, dropping like flies.  No kidding.  They, they were so scared that the, uh, the molten core and it was molten at that point 
[00:21:30]  was starting to bust through the concrete and then there was water underneath the concrete.  And if it hit that, it would have been over, John, just fucking would have, they said  it pretty much would have contaminated Europe.  So, uh, they had to get people in there to drain the water out from underneath the,  the reactor.  They got these guys, miners, they brought in miners to dig tunnels underneath the reactor  core where it was melting and just kept digging.  Yeah.  They just keep digging.  And then they like filled that up with concrete and it was, uh, it was just amazing. 
[00:22:00]  And they didn't tell people shit.  They were just like, yeah, go ahead.  Get in there.  Can I, can I ask you a dumb question?  But you seem to know a little bit about everything.  I try.  Now, you know, this radiation, you said it has a half-life of thousands of years.  Yeah.  So like Chernobyl could still affect shit.  That's still hot underneath all that shit.  It's still hot and eventually could what?  Go through the cement?  Uh, yeah.  Well, they, they have a pretty well encased now.  Okay.  Is there, have you ever seen a show where scientists are trying to figure out how to knock down the 
[00:22:30]  half-life of this shit?  Or is that just a ridiculous statement on my part?  I, I don't think it could really be done.  Yeah.  As of now though.  As of right now.  Yeah.  You think there's, there's just that one, that, that fucking nuclear reaction that happens  is, uh, it's, it's just the law of nature and physics.  And it's very hard to, uh, right.  I think they ought to just put it in a rocket and ship it out into Spain.  Just imagine that though.  And then the rocket explodes.  It just seems like. 
[00:23:00]  Just send it into the sun.  It seems like that technology is just, uh, too powerful for humans.  It's very powerful.  For human beings.  It really is.  It's very, very powerful.  I don't, I don't like it.  Uh, very, very creepy.  I don't like this one.  It's, uh.  I was looking at the map of Long Island, where we're from, obviously.  And, um, all the power plants that were supposed to be on Long Island.  Oh my God.  I don't know who the fuck was able to figure that out, how to shut that shit down.  But I thank you.  That was the big no nukes campaign.  But they had shore.  Jackson Brown, man. 
[00:23:30]  Oh really?  He was in there.  And Martin Sheen.  Did you see the map?  They wanted one in Queens?  In Queens.  Queens.  Which would have just trapped everybody on Long Island.  For the people elsewhere that don't know much about Queens.  It's a massive city in itself.  I don't know, a city officially, but.  Giant borough.  Basically everyone gets about, uh, a ten, ten foot by ten foot, uh, space to live in.  Piece of property.  That's about it.  And everybody that, uh, lives on Long Island, the only way to get off Long Island is to 
[00:24:00]  go through Queens.  So you'd be fine.  And then take the bridges to, you know, various places in New York.  Right.  Uh, but, but that would have blocked it if there was an accident there.  And everybody on Long Island would have just been killed because you, even Montauk Point  wouldn't have been far enough away to get away from the radiation.  So it just would have killed everyone on Long Island.  Holy shit.  What a dumb idea.  I don't know what they were thinking.  That was the old Lilco.  Yeah.  Lilco, the Long Island lighting company.  They were like, yeah, let's just build nuclear power plants. 
[00:24:30]  Fuck it.  Unbelievable.  So.  Beethoven and Mozart still get played.  Yeah.  Cause then it becomes, that's a good point.  That's fucking funny.  Were they doing concerts?  I, I, yeah, concertos.  Were they, were they?  You gotta go back that far?  Yeah.  But that's a really good point.  You know, you're watching other people do, uh, their music perfectly.  Yeah.  I guess so.  I mean, I don't think they were singing much, but.  No, but it's not a, I'll miss dance.  Great line.  Fuck. 
[00:25:00]  What did we miss?  Uh, Doug, go ahead.  Yeah.  Anthony, you had a fucking great line.  I always say something about somebody walking sideways on CNN and you go, like a crab.  Oh, I, I, they're 90% just throwaways, sir.  No, that's actually a good line.  I heard that.  Um.  Crab.  Yeah, I would watch for it.  Yeah.  I haven't seen that one.  Did you see the news guy on CNN who, who, who's used to talking about cold fronts and,  and, uh, hurricanes and stuff. 
[00:25:30]  And now.  Is he a nuclear expert?  He's a nuclear expert, but it gets really over the top excited about it.  Oh, I, I've seen that guy and he's like, and then the water is supposed to be.  Yeah.  That guy gets really psyched.  Cause sometimes I notice shit and I'm like, eh, it's probably not worth bringing to the  show.  But if you're noticing it too, maybe Sam could pull one of his really exciting soliloquies  on fucking nuclear power plants and, and then you got the steam over here.  Yeah.  You saw that, right?  Oh, I saw that guy.  He was very excited.  And, uh, Glenn Beck also gets very excited and he has props. 
[00:26:00]  He's like Gallagher.  He's like the Gallagher of, uh, nuclear, uh, power.  Was it, was it professor, uh, Glenn Beck?  Professor Glenn Beck.  Which version was it?  It was professor Glenn Beck.  Or was it the robe wearing, uh, Glenn Beck?  It wasn't panicky Pete, uh, Glenn Beck either, because he was saying that, uh, this is not  anything to worry about, uh, but he had various pots and pans, pots and pans, pots and pans,  actual pots and pans, actual pots and pans.  Oh boy.  He had a pressure cooker, which was the, um, you know, the, the core containment unit. 
[00:26:30]  And then he had that in another big pot and pan with a lid on it.  Okay.  And he goes, and that's what exploded.  The lid came off that, but he still, we still got the pressure cooker.  Okay.  So he just brought in like some pots and pans from his house.  What does the frying pan represent?  Uh, I think the frying pan was the thing that's underneath the, uh, the action.  Well, core unit, uh, no teapot, which would have been good for the release of steam.  I would have brought a teapot, a little kettle, a little tea kettle.  That might've worked pretty well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, so he had that and he was saying that, um, you know, the news is pretty much getting 
[00:27:00]  very panicky Pete about the whole thing, but he's one that's, you know, well, panicky.  Um, I don't know when they're going to tell everyone, but this is the worst case scenario.  I don't know why they're slowly telling people.  They're still saying it's a six.  It's a seven.  They're saying it's a six.  Chernobyl was a seven.  It's a seven.  This is a seven.  Did you see the explosions in Chernobyl like we're seeing on TV?  Uh, the, that's causing something they're not talking about.  The explosions here, they say are in the containment buildings and not in the actual containers. 
[00:27:30]  And, uh, it hasn't really damaged them this thing, or it's damaged them a little bit.  The Chernobyl one blew the top off of the actual reactor container.  And they said a, a, a plume of multicolored, brilliant blues, yellows, reds came shooting  out of the top, like a Roman candle, a continuous fountain of nuclear material, right?  Uh, just like a volcano of nuclear material. 
[00:28:00]  And, and, and still people were just like, well, we'll just leave, let everybody just  hang out.  How did you sleep last night?  Very well.  Really?  I really did.  You have Chernobyl on one screen and then you got the Japanese thing on live TV and you  slept like a baby.  I wasn't even really able to nap yesterday when I got home because I had, uh, uh, some,  uh, uh, Fios work being done at my house.  And then, um, I, I, I was up for the remainder of the time.  So I, I got very sleepy.  So I was able to go to sleep, but I was, I was watching, you know, nuclear stuff all over. 
[00:28:30]  It's like, and I was kind of looking up at the TV and looking down at the Chernobyl documentary  going, all right, that's very similar.  Really?  Okay.  That's good.  Uh, yeah, the radius they're putting around that.  That's similar to the radius.  You were comparing.  Yeah.  A little comparing, seeing how bad it is.  But the Chernobyl one was just completely fucked up.  Unbelievably bad.  I don't need to know knowledge that much.  Nah, I kind of like that shit.  I like to turn it off.  Yeah.  I kind of like that shit.  Replay Trouble No More in my head by the, the Allman brothers. 
[00:29:00]  By the Allman's while you're snooze, going to snooze.  There's Trouble No More.  See, Trouble No More.  Just turn that shit off.  There's Trouble No More.  Oh, there you go.  There's a theme today.  The Allman brothers could get you through tragedy.  I don't know.  All right.  We'll play a little of this.  Yeah, man.  This was about 17 minutes last night.  17 minutes.  That's great.  So you saw like three songs.  They started with this.  So, you know, you got to start long to get everyone in the groove.  I'd be going like, when do the words come in? 
[00:29:30]  Because I'm sure the words didn't come in this soon.  Last night?  No, no.  Oh, I bet the intro was, oh, I bet it was long.  It was a while.  Yes, I bet it was long.  And you're, you're probably right.  I probably saw about an hour and a half.  Yeah.  And I probably saw maybe six songs.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Six songs in an hour and a half.  That's about what I would guess.  Holy shit.  I fucking cut my throat.  Really?  Sorry.  You need the hits.  I need the hits.  I need the catchy fucking hook.  Steve Earle was on The Wire. 
[00:30:00]  That's right.  He was.  But you don't watch The Wire.  When are you going to watch that show?  No, I fucking gave up.  I want to.  It's good.  It's a great series.  But there's so much shit going on now.  I don't have the time.  Oh, I see.  To watch anything.  Did you get caught up in season two, which slows a lot of people down?  It slowed down, yeah.  Get through season two.  That's where I left off.  Although you start appreciating season two, and then it gets season three, four, and five.  Forget it.  I got nothing against it.  It's a great, great series.  From what I was seeing, I loved it. 
[00:30:30]  But I just got so much to fuck with.  And I had just gotten out of Lost.  They were a rebound for me.  They were a rebound after a long-term Lost relationship.  So I got into The Wire, and I just couldn't.  I had to break up with The Wire.  I understand.  Let me go to Rob in Jersey, because I'm telling you, when I said April showers bring May flowers,  now it's May flowers bring June flowers.  Wait.  May showers.  May showers bring June flowers.  June flowers.  Go ahead, Rob.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  A couple years ago, when we had that major tsunami,  I just predicted that it actually shifted the Earth's axis by a single degree or a half a degree.  Access?  Which is changing weather patterns all over the world.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I believe it.  They say all these earthquakes shift the axis, though, for at least a little while.  If not, I don't think it's permanent.  I think it swings back where it belongs.  Yeah.  I believe it, man.  Hey, you know, thank you, Rob.  The other thing I want to bring up, Gilbert Gottfried getting fired for those jokes. 
[00:31:30]  I think it's ridiculous that a comedian gets fired for doing what a comedian does.  I really do.  I think Gilbert Gottfried's an asshole, and I'm sure he was trying to be as outrageous as possible, by the way.  That's what he does.  He tries to be outraged.  You've got to add that to the equation.  It's outraged.  And I was really thinking about it, and everyone's outraged.  But no one's outraged when CNN or the rest of these news outlets stick cameras in people's faces that lost their wife, their wife or their kids. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're just bawling and bawling, and I'm thinking to myself, how is that okay, but a comedian making jokes about the whole thing isn't?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  I would say that sticking a camera in a mourner's face is way worse than some asshole making a joke about it.  Way the fuck worse.  There was one guy, this is where my sick side is going to come in. 
[00:32:30]  I apologize.  I shouldn't laugh.  But he's telling this horrible, you know, wrenching story about how his wife was too heavy to pull up on the hill.  Did you see that one on CNN?  Where he had her hand.  Oh, no.  And he was able to get to higher ground, and he needed to pull her up onto higher ground, and I think his daughter was involved, too.  And they had to let go because she was too heavy.  Oh, man.  But the guy is bawling, and now he's sitting in the spot where he let go, assuming that that's where she is somewhere. 
[00:33:00]  He let go, and she just got swept away?  Yeah.  Oh, that's fucked up right there.  It was CNN.  I thought nothing of having a camera in this guy's face as he's telling his heart-wrenching story, and the tears are pouring from his face.  That's pretty awful.  And then the next story is about how Gilbert Godfrey is the worst human being on the planet for telling a few jokes about the thing.  A few jokes.  It doesn't make sense to me.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  Yeah, that's pretty bad right there.  Holy shit.  As far as news goes, I understand showing the waves, showing the destruction, showing people even running for safety. 
[00:33:30]  But then when it comes to throwing the camera, you know what happened.  You don't need CNN or Fox or MSNBC to now, to really, you know, shove the point home by having, you know, people just pouring out raw emotion because their loved ones are gone.  Yeah.  They had another couple looking for their kids that were in a kindergarten class.  Gone.  Of course they're gone.  Dead.  You don't need to tell us that, you know, that they're gone. 
[00:34:00]  I don't get it.  That's fucked up, man.  I think that's way worse.  Yeah.  They really do.  Oh, it absolutely is.  It might don't mind the world.  Than a joke?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, but you.  That's way worse than a joke.  Yeah.  I was only joking.  You know, words hurt, they say.  Words don't hurt.  Tsunamis hurt.  Earthquakes hurt.  Tsunamis really hurt. 
[00:34:30]  Wow, that's fucked up.  Where are you at with that?  Yeah, I think the news is a lot more despicable than they ever want to let on to be.  By the way, if you want to show them, fine.  But then don't go after Gilbert Godfrey because you're kind of doing the same fucking thing, man.  But they're exploiting the situation in the way they know how.  Gilbert does it with, you know, his comedy.  And they do it with shoving cameras in people's faces and getting them to get a soundbite or some misery or destruction. 
[00:35:00]  And there was a twat.  I've got to remember her name.  I've got to look up the cast of CNN.  It's a cast.  Yeah.  You know, they cast roles.  The show.  She was so outraged by Gilbert Godfrey.  And I hate when people go, so-called jokes.  Oh, yeah.  They are jokes.  It's dark humor.  And unfortunately, there were a lot of people that found those jokes funny and will always find that type of thing funny. 
[00:35:30]  So, I mean, she's editorializing, like, so-called jokes.  So-called.  And there was another woman saying, it might have been the same one, who knows.  Saying, I just don't understand how people think it's funny when there's such devastation.  It's like, no, they don't.  See, the difference is, you're not just making ha-ha about people dying, death, and destruction.  Comedians take the situation and you're separate from it. 
[00:36:00]  You're not literally, you're not being literal.  That's what jokes are.  It's taking a hard situation and putting a twist to it that's uncomfortable, fucking funny, whatever it is.  And makes people laugh or go like, oh, jeez.  It's a coping mechanism.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  It's been that way forever.  So don't fucking-  And they're on their high horse, I'd like to say.  Yeah.  Their high horse.  And the people that are going to be offended by a tsunami joke by Gilbert Gottfried, they're too busy trying to see if their loved ones are alive. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  They don't even have time to fucking see the jokes.  It's ridiculous.  It's just all fucked up, man.  Just ridiculous.  So hopefully we can get the guy that became an expert, the weather guy, who's now a nuclear power plant expert.  Yeah.  I've watched this guy for many years, and I'd never heard him talk about nuclear power before.  But you know there's a news guy, the leader of CNN, going, okay, you're now going to be a nuclear power plant expert.  Yeah.  Do a little Wikipedia there. 
[00:37:00]  Be ready in 15 minutes.  You've got to know this shit.  Right.  Why?  Right.  Why?  You study up on tsunami waves.  I'm serious.  Oh, I know.  I love it, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I love watching how the media goes about this shit.  I love it from every angle.  Everybody is becoming very educated as far as nuclear reactors go.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  You know way more than what they're saying on TV. 
[00:37:30]  And then I get crucified by some people.  But you know way more.  They're like, you know what?  Why don't you do some reading on it?  It's like, I don't know everything, but I know the basics.  I know enough to know what's happening when they talk about this shit.  That's all.  I used to play a video game.  It was about a nuclear power plant.  And they'd shove emergencies in and you'd have to keep the pumps running.  Brian is saying I'm way off base.  Go ahead, Brian.  You're a little off base.  Well, first and foremost, the fact that Godfrey deleted those tweets and then issued some 
[00:38:00]  sort of half-assed apology on Twitter.  If you have the ball to put it up there in the first place, keep it up there.  Stand by your words.  He's just trying to save himself.  Brian, hold on.  Hold on.  Let's slow down here.  To your first point, I completely agree.  Yeah.  But he was just trying to save his...  Save his ass.  Save his ass.  But if you're brave enough to do that, then you really should stick by it.  Yep.  And there's enough people that could defend you.  And you can defend yourself even if you have the intelligence.  Right.  But he knew what he was doing when he wrote that. 
[00:38:30]  You don't write that and think no one's not going to be offended by this.  Well, we...  And we said that earlier, too, to be honest.  To be fair, we know that...  We know Gilbert Godfrey enough that he's one of these guys that wants to get as outrageous  as possible.  Right.  I mean, history shows he was one of the first, if not the first guy, to do a 9-11 joke.  Right.  But he knew what he was doing.  But anyway, as far as the news is concerned...  Yeah.  I see what you're saying, and the news definitely are scumbags from time to time. 
[00:39:00]  But they're just showing that human side of it.  It's not...  It's definitely not the same.  It's not even close to the same thing.  It's like putting those people in a room with Gilbert and having him tell those shitty  jokes in front of him.  That's bad.  But the news just to interview people who love, you know, loved ones is a completely different  thing.  It's showing that human toll.  No, the human toll.  No, there's intent there.  There's intent on the news's part to get ratings.  And they know that that's the ratings grabber.  That's the outrageous shit people want to see.  They could have just quoted... 
[00:39:30]  They could have just said, and a gentleman lost his wife, and blah, blah.  And he was quoted as saying, holy shit, this sucks, or whatever.  But they got to get the fucking shot.  They got to show the devastation.  They got to show the tsunami hitting eight million times.  What does that do?  And why do you think they're doing that?  They want people staying on their channel, watching the commercials for fucking cars and  whatever else they're selling.  Yeah.  It's heart-wrenching enough.  When you see a tsunami taking out a whole village, and you see these houses just fucking 
[00:40:00]  being ripped from their foundation and floating down streets and back into the ocean, you  can fill in the blanks and realize, wow, a lot of people just fucking died.  Yeah.  I agree with you in that respect.  Yeah, they're doing it for ratings, blah, blah, blah.  You know, to compare what the news is doing to what Gilbert Gottfried...  Why?  He's doing his job.  He's doing what he does.  Is that his job?  Yeah.  Yeah, his job is to make jokes.  His job is to make jokes.  All right.  I don't see...  I don't think a guy should be fired for making jokes ever. 
[00:40:30]  I mean, ever.  If there's some kind of...  I'm trying to think the intent thing, even.  But a lot of times, you're not even thinking that.  You're just trying to get a laugh going.  Yeah, you get a laugh.  His intent wasn't going, what could I do to upset Japanese people?  He wasn't thinking that.  It's like, you get a joke and you just blow it out.  I think in general, the news is way more despicable than a comedian telling the jokes.  I mean, you've seen this.  They have the montages now, and they got someone to compose some really sad music to make sure 
[00:41:00]  you realize how sad it is.  I don't need that.  I can figure that shit out in my own brain.  Well, it's production value.  They got to put some production with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they have the totally do, but the low level...  Toot, toot, toot, toot.  I don't know, Brian.  I guess we look at it differently, which is fine.  Well, at least you agree on the fact that he shouldn't have deleted them and issued some  sort of F-S apology.  Yeah.  We've been in that apology world.  Sometimes your hand is forced because you realize you're going to lose your entire livelihood. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I mean, we're guilty of doing the fake apology, but at least we're finally admitting  that to everybody.  Right.  We were so guilty of that.  It's a fake apology.  If he already lost the gig, what's the apology doing at this point?  Yeah, I don't know.  Is it your job?  I don't get it.  Yeah, because he's going to be...  Well, he probably wants another gig.  Yeah.  Down the road.  That's so down the road, maybe he gets another mainstream gig like that, right? 
[00:42:00]  Of course.  So we got nuclear experts.  I don't want to know, man.  Nuclear experts.  You want one?  They all have different opinions of what is going to happen because no one knows exactly  what's going to happen yet, but let's talk to one and see what he says.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tim in Ohio.  Tim.  Hey, how are you guys doing this morning?  Hello, Tim.  Hey, it is not like a river, first of all.  It is like a river of molten magma.  You guys are going to put me on after racist Aflac duck and Japanese Gilbert Grape.  Great. 
[00:42:30]  So I'm licensed on this type of reactor in the United States.  I've been working on them for 17 years.  You could drive one?  Yes.  Ah, good.  I keep it in my backyard for convenience.  Yes.  It's Homer Simpson on the front.  I'm a real-life Homer Simpson, and I train homers for a living.  This is the first time I've listened to the mainstream media and want to just bang my head  against the wall.  Yeah?  What's your take on this?  Well, first of all, it's nowhere near as bad as it looks, and you can tell that if  you look because now they attach all the refinery fire pictures and stuff. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They kind of do that to make it look worse.  You're right.  Oh, is that what?  See?  All right.  That helps our point.  So the media is not explaining what each one of these individual fires is.  Yeah.  Yeah, they show the fires, and they're like, oh.  And they make it look like it's right where the fucking reaction is happening.  Yeah, yeah.  Literally right at ground zero of the reaction.  Oh, that's a very interesting point.  Thanks, Tim.  Keep going.  Right.  So if you look at this, these reactors are designed for a 9.0 earthquake in Japan, if 
[00:43:30]  you look at the licensing documents.  So that's what happened.  It's the worst possible scenario.  So yeah, they're damaged.  They're broken.  They're not going to be used again.  But this, you know, I can't tell whether it's going to be an atomic twister or a China  syndrome thing.  It's way out of proportion.  The first three are flooded with seawater.  That's going to shield them and cool them.  You're not going to hear anything else about those three, maybe an occasional venting.  And that fire in Unit 4 was not in the fuel pool.  It was below the fuel pool in a lube oil system.  Yeah.  I heard, now what about the rods? 
[00:44:00]  What about the used rods that are in that pool above the containment building?  Right.  That's the biggest danger right now for release.  What it is, it's a 40-foot deep swimming pool.  Yeah.  And you put used rods in the bottom.  Well, the used rods will still melt if they get uncovered.  Rods.  Wow.  Yeah.  So that's just sitting in water.  And what are they, just trying to keep that thing full of water?  Right.  And they were going to airdrop water in, but they figured out that the hole in the roof  isn't close enough to the swimming pool, so they've just got to find a different way.  Getting water in there, huh? 
[00:44:30]  Big hose.  Get a big hose.  Siphon it.  Drop a hose in there.  Siphon from the ocean.  Mm-hmm.  So I know I'll be yelling about release.  The stuff they've ended the first couple days is short-lived gases.  It's not, if you don't stand up in the air in the plume, you're going to be okay.  Yeah.  They've never really gotten it to the point where they're like, wow, okay, this radiation is immediately lethal.  We must evacuate.  They keep getting these radioactive spikes, I guess, and pulling people out, and then it calms down, and they go back in. 
[00:45:00]  I've never seen a group of people want a meltdown more than I've seen it.  Oh, my God.  You are absolutely right.  And that's another despicable thing with the news.  They want a meltdown.  They're talking about it like, oh, is the core uncovered?  We could get, you know, if the core is uncovered, we could get a meltdown, and this.  They want it.  They want the worst-case scenario always.  Yep.  Because that helps their business.  Right.  Well, if you look at credible sources, there was some damage in Unit 1, some in Unit 3, but they're covered now. 
[00:45:30]  And when the fuel in these reactors are covered, they stay cool.  That's their nature.  Yeah.  Boiling water reactor.  So, you know, that part's over.  You worry about the spent fuel in Unit 4.  Once they get that one covered up and filled, they're going to take precautionary measures with the other two.  This is all pretty much proceduralized, and we train for it.  So it's not like they're just making it up as they go along.  And the Japanese are the best at this in the world.  Yeah, they are pretty good at that stuff.  They're crafty.  They know they're nukes, huh?  I'd say they're crafty. 
[00:46:00]  They are crafty.  Well, they know they're nukes, that's for sure.  All right, Tim.  All right, well, thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  There's a little bit of a voice of reason, Opie.  We heard a little voice of reason, something to say, hey, calm down, people.  The news gets off on this stuff.  Yeah.  In the end, it goes back to what we say about Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and all that.  But they want Obama in office because it's good for business.  And you could say, I'm crazy all you want, but that is a fact. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  That is a fact.  They want it.  In the end, they want Obama, and they probably want him for a second term because it's good for business.  He's another one.  Yeah.  He's another fucking one.  And the news, the same thing.  They want the worst-case scenario because it's good for their business.  We have a nuclear expert, somebody that works in a nuclear power plant on line four.  He's got another voice of reason.  Hello.  Oh, my God.  Ah! 
[00:47:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, that's better.  Ah!  Oh.  Ah!  Ah!  That doesn't sound good.  Sir?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  So you work in the plant?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  He's God.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, well, that was...  Yeah, he's trying to save his own life.  Screaming Homer rules.  Funny every time. 
[00:47:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Yeah, go ahead.  Another part of this story is...  Now, you know, one of my favorite presidents of the United States ever is Barack Hussein Obama.  um but even i even i have to say i think he's dropping the ball on a lot of things these days  holy shit first of all the only news i've heard out of the white house is that fucking obama has 
[00:48:00]  chosen his brackets oh really yeah that's very exciting that's it there's fucking japan's  melting yeah uh the middle east is coming apart at the scenes uh seems bahrain is is now just  fucking firing on people and i think the saudis are in there now too uh cleaning up but he picked  his bracket but he picked his bracket that's the only news this motherfucker can't seem to say uh  what he wants over there in libya he was saying uh yeah you know we ought to we ought to get rid of um 
[00:48:30]  uh qaddafi yeah that would be good if the rebels uh you know and that that situation that's old  news i know so that's taken care of and it's like america won't even take the lead as far as saying  yeah no fly zone let's get this together let's get a strong uh voice in the u.n and maybe um figure  something out because either either look you can have it both ways either you want libya with or  without a qaddafi either one pick one pick one pick one and go with it uh if you want uh one 
[00:49:00]  without qaddafi then you gotta fucking give a little aid to the rebels which i don't mean necessarily  mean direct military aid but um have uh the u.n enforce a no-fly zone this guy and and and hillary  have not done anything they are not taking any lead in this situation people do look to america for 
[00:49:30]  to take a lead and i don't mean being world police i mean um some type of ideas just know that there's  involvement there um he got his prayers for japan uh but but there's no he hasn't there's no like  speech there's no uh no no help about about uh the economic like what he's going to do to help  what's happening economically because of the japan situation the guy has done nothing yeah but who did 
[00:50:00]  he pick who did he pick for what the brackets oh oh the brackets yeah that's very very uh exciting  news that is true that is true you got your brackets um i could care less about march madness  i don't even pay attention to march madness what's wrong with you you're not an american the brackets  i pick are in my e-trade account those are my brackets holy shit i need apple to go up today bad 
[00:50:30]  holy fuckaroni yeah the uh oh so obama that's what i'd word out of the white house obama has  picked his brackets is he taking charlie sheen over georgetown because i am charlie sheen yeah  charlie sheen's so great he made the brackets oh did he yeah i'm taking uh him over georgetown  charlie sheen talk about old news stupid charlie sheen and if you're one of those dummies that want  a ticket for his stupid fucking his dumb show his dumb tour you're you're just a dope his dumb show 
[00:51:00]  and then this one also that he's pulling with this internship thing yeah and and you read a million  tweets from people that go oh my god i made it to the second uh round like uh he picked me sent me  an email right do you idiots understand he sent everyone an email everyone that applied to be an  intern for charlie sheen right is has made the second round what can i and it's reading the  twitters it's like dude i got an email i mean i i made the the second round pick anything on this sam 
[00:51:30]  yeah you remember our old intern love buzz yes i got a an email a very excited email from him last  night out of the blue letting me know that he had made it to the second round wow charlie sheen  i've never read so many tweets from idiots that think they made this second round they sent out  an email to everybody saying they're trying to get the excitement going oh my god is that what's 
[00:52:00]  happening yeah that's what's happening well i'm not watching um documentaries on uh nuclear holocaust  i'm watching charlie sheen well this brings up a good point i i i heard that yesterday we were denied  interns again for the upcoming semester is that true does someone want to like is that true let me look  around they denied us interns again which is basically affecting our radio show so i don't  understand what the fuck they're doing down the hall but try to make it harder to do to do this radio 
[00:52:30]  show what's the reasoning by the way they're gonna read is it the old reason still they're gonna they're  gonna revisit it in the fall you're fucking hurting our show because we need people around that could do  like mundane shit for us this doesn't make sense and charlie sheen has an internship program do you  understand do you understand yeah where yeah you're basically saying we're worse than charlie sheen  yeah why is some event i'll just say some event why is that prohibiting us from having an intern 
[00:53:00]  why don't don't you think it's it's a punishment we're being this isn't this isn't a well we just want  to lay back and make sure like things but they're punishing their own company right because they're  weakening the show a little bit no we need we need we need interns can we just fucking stop with  this nonsense this baby shit nonsense and and get us some fucking interns oh god interns are really 
[00:53:30]  important to a high profile radio show they really are you can't we kind of need this is a lot of like  a lot of busy work that now busy work now the main guys that work for the show have to do a lot of the  busy work so now they're not doing other stuff they could be doing it doesn't make sense what the  fuck is scar greenstein doing to us get us fucking interns do something for once unbelievable stop  asking me personally what could i do to make you you know make it easier for you around here and then 
[00:54:00]  you tell them like well besides that oh besides that turn besides that besides that get us fucking  interns i'm not acknowledging the gary and the rob those dopes  i talked to scott greenstein about it get us fucking interns every time you see us in the hall what can i  do what can everything no everything's not all right get us fucking interns start there  stop fucking holding something over the show you're holding something over the show there was 
[00:54:30]  an issue it was dealt with let's fucking move on the issue was dealt with absolutely yeah it was dealt  with and we've been punished for uh at least four months yeah enough of the punishment shit you're  you're hurting the company you're hurting our show which hurts the company we're a high profile show  that you're making it harder for us to do our jobs right it doesn't make sense get us fucking interns  darry and rob you don't have to listen to this because i know you're useless as far as 
[00:55:00]  just about everything goes make a fucking maniac at us greenstein get us fucking interns thank you  that's what you could do don't look at me in the hall until you get us interns that's what i say  they need interns i don't care what happened to the dow futures why they're down 30 now  jr in indiana see now the bursts are nice and short and we go back to the show right so relax  everybody go ahead jr hey what's going on guys hey hello hey i'm just uh uh well i'm pretty much 
[00:55:30]  back up with everything that tim said earlier uh but the whole speculation thing that these  honking anchors are doing just makes me crazy yeah you know it's like this morning they're  saying well there's a radioactive cloud hanging over the plant bullshit yeah yeah they have no  fucking idea i'm a just you know i'm an ex-reactor operator uh from the navy and i did civilian  uh or work in the uh civilian industry were you on a submarine or were you on a a nuclear uh ship 
[00:56:00]  a nuclear uh a carrier i was uh i was doing training for both uh i trained the officers  and the elicits for both oh you do that fun stuff where you got to put on a fire suit and get in there  with your hoses your big man hose your big man hose your big fat thick man hose big man hose  your turgent man hose turgent turgent sorry yes turgent right well we learned that word recently 
[00:56:30]  from jimmy i gotta say proper turgid turgid man hose how did this go to turgid man hose i don't know  you called this show that's how exactly anyway i just called a backup op on that by the way  opie it's not quite chernobyl chernobyl was uh i don't know if you actually know what happened with  that but it was uh some dumbass engineer that decided he wanted to test the plant and see what  happens see what happens when you jerk a control rod out of the top of the core yeah he they were 
[00:57:00]  testing it was funny it's like yeah let's test we'll fucking pull a control rod out out and the  thing just fucking lit up like a roman candle is that what happened yeah oh what an idiot in the  middle of the night it's like oh really really kablammo and there goes radiation everywhere  they defeated every safety uh every safety backup in order to do this little test that they did and  uh it didn't work out for good all right you know what else i noticed about that watching the  chernobyl thing last night um it was 1986 that that happened and uh the soviet union really just 
[00:57:30]  sucked because you watch um the the films from then i swear you would think you were watching world  war ii footage it is this old grainy like shit and the vehicles that are driving around and the  people it's i swear to you it looked like at the very least it looked like the 50s and it was 86  that's unbelievable they fucking stunk glad they're gone 25 years so how many years left before that 
[00:58:00]  thing is i think 9 975 years about that 9 975 yeah and then it ought to be it ought to be all right  to dig back up oh my god uh it's a little warm yeah there's that famous picture of uh the uh core  completely exposed completely melted down inside the reactor chamber and you just see the debris 
[00:58:30]  everything exploded around it all the the beams and everything and then right in the middle is this  just bright red fucking bubbling melting molten uh nuclear material is that why um eastern europeans  have moles uh maybe maybe that's it the moles from the radiation uh no i understand the radiation  affects the film i'm not talking about just the film around uh chernobyl i'm talking films of people 
[00:59:00]  from then that were in moscow doing shit and it was 1986 and it still looked like the 50s  the old vehicles and everything radiation doesn't turn vehicles old they just old army vehicles and  refugees and shit they just had old vehicles to begin with yeah uh someone wrote that wolf blitzer  is uh juggling his balls wait let me see wolf blitzer is loving this of course uh oh jordan thanks  jordan's a regular uh from scranity writes dude i saw wolf blitzer discreetly juggling his balls when 
[00:59:30]  he was talking about a meltdown it turned him on so much oh where in the uh situation room well at least  he finally has a situation yeah this is a situation every monitor can be filled up yeah  he's called his show the situation room for years when uh on most days there's not a situation there's  nothing going on every day you can't have a situation every day he finally has a situation  for his situation room he's been preparing for this for years oh we'd love this now it's a situation  he's he's living for this and he's one of those important guys that has to be over there oh oh he  left the situation room to go over there is he going to be okay is anderson cooper safe i don't care 
[01:00:00]  people are worried about anderson cooper is he going to be safe uh you could tell the guys that are like  get me over to japan right now get me over there i'm a big name and then they all got to go over  there wolf blitzer yeah yeah who else is over there from uh like fox news solid solid dad is  solid dad shepherd smith shepherd shepherd shep's over there i kind of like shep as a newsman he is 
[01:00:30]  i kind of like him i hated him at first i kind of like turn into like one of the funniest he don't  give a shit kind of guys right uh iraq shepherd lately has he gets so mad at the people in new york  when his equipment's not working so he'll be doing a report and he goes hang on a second for those in  new york i can't hear anything in my headphones and he just stares at the camera he doesn't care  and then goes back to his news oh that's classic shepherd smith or he'll say something and fuck  up and i'm like oops did i just say content oh well yeah it's cable it's cable i could do that 
[01:01:00]  every once in a while he said the blowjob jenny on the block blowjob line he's just like he's laughing  he survived that yeah whatever i like the shep i i don't know if i agree with him at times but i like  i like watching him i like watching him and soledad she's she's over there but she's got her  hair pulled back and she's wearing like a north face jacket she's soledad she's dressed for the  role of uh walking around these destroyed villages showing you good for her yachts on top of houses 
[01:01:30]  and whatever yeah i don't know how they're gonna clean that up you've seen they've kind of plowed  through some of the debris to make these makeshift roads and um you look around just go how the fuck  what are they gonna do i i how they're cleaning that up honestly i think uh what they need to do  is keep some of these areas exactly how they are now and and make it a tourist trap just make it a  tourist attraction of hey look at this tsunami fill if you knew there was no radiation in the air i i  would go tomorrow to check that out to check it out yeah man that's crazy shit we saw i don't think 
[01:02:00]  they want to do that with the amount of people that died crazy shit also uh jack cafferty i watched  him last night and that old curmudgeon like jack cafferty i don't know if i agree with him at times  either but i love how he presents shit he jumped right on the big hot topic subject of this whole  thing the um uh why aren't we seeing any uh looting and um beatings and things like that and uh illegal  activity over there in japan uh and he went off and just blatantly said you know they have a much better 
[01:02:30]  society as far as that they they work for the collective for their country they are very uh  proud of their their country and don't want it to look bad and because they know the whole world is  looking as opposed to and then he brought up things like haiti and katrina and uh and then he was  reading letters from people that were saying um you know we're we're despicable we're americans that  love our country but love ourselves more and um and japan is a country that loves its country and 
[01:03:00]  will sacrifice themselves not maybe literally but uh for the greater good of their country  and uh he was jumping all over that there's definitely a cultural difference there is a huge  cultural difference uh the the japanese have always been that way they've always been i mean during  world war ii the whole kamikaze thing uh all for the emperor all for the country that's that sounds  all well and good but it makes for a very boring society uh does it i think so i don't know they're 
[01:03:30]  selling uh teen panties and vending machines oh yeah there is that side of it you're right how's  that industry going did they have to shut that down for any length of time i know i think they're  reopening like the toyota plant yeah they're they're reopening reopening the uh teen panty vending  machine yeah teen girls industry teen girls are getting moist all over japan filling up those uh  vending machines yeah what a sick society that's hey uh speaking of that when 9-11 hit i don't  remember was there a lot of uh looting and stuff um no no we didn't get any looting that was that 
[01:04:00]  was uh all uh pride and nation again that kind of brought everybody together and also when we had  that uh was it a brownout or a blackout remember a couple of years ago well it all depends on the  what but that was about six or seven years ago maybe yeah yeah now how bad was that as far as  polluting goes uh not bad at all when you take everyone's electricity away in manhattan you would  assume that some crazy shit would go not bad i'll tell you what the economy was a lot better back  then uh and the police protection has been unbelievable in new york it's one thing giuliani 
[01:04:30]  decided uh to do is just put a fuckload of cops and clean up the shit right and uh i think that helped  okay but um yeah it but you get things like like i said haiti two days after the earthquake machete  wielding uh gangs raping and and looting uh i saw something that was this was actually taken off of  youtube uh when i clicked on the link and it said um taken off for policy reasons because youtube does not 
[01:05:00]  support hate speech and i was like wow and it's just this guy talking about haiti's history  the history of haiti and why it is like it is now and how it was when it was a french colony  haiti was one of like the richest uh caribbean nations one of the richest really france a bunch  of frenchies were over there the french it was a french colony and they built all those wonderful  mansions and palaces that uh you see are all busted apart now but uh built all that it was a great place 
[01:05:30]  to go and vacation and work and live and then there was a slave uprising and the slaves went around  and just killed all the fucking french just slit their fucking throats killed them all and took over  haiti and from that point on what year was that it went that was the uh seven 17s i think somewhere in  the 17s right uh it went down to what it ended up being which was just impoverished and uh crime-ridden 
[01:06:00]  corrupt and three and three different occasions the united states army went in to try to build an  infrastructure and set the people straight and say look we'll build the infrastructure we'll give you  uh factories and jobs because we didn't want commies moving in there did that and the second we left  every time it reverted back to shit and crumbling buildings no one taking care of shit and then this  last earthquake just completely decimated the place and uh we send donations and and nothing's been done 
[01:06:30]  no one knows where the fuck this money is hey sean penn how about instead of going down there and  bitching about america not helping with all the fucking money that was sent there why don't you  why don't you point a finger at one of the corrupt motherfuckers down there that's pocketing the cash  uh because they have a history of corruption and robbing their people and not contributing to  the country how about that how about you look into that but it just goes to show there are different 
[01:07:00]  societies and different cultures and different way people's people react to uh um devastation and  and uh i don't think haiti did such a good job of it to tell you the truth i think japan amazing  doing much better amazing what they've done uh this guy's really mad at you hey fuck you we gotta get  the other side on a little bit and then you argue with i don't care rob in cleveland rob hey guys  oh big fan anthony big fan but you're being a cunt all right how how sir is that with a k or a c sir 
[01:07:30]  a hard c what's uh what's the problem sir go ahead uh you're you're you got the mic  every time dude i just want to let me just say i am a republican i hate obama however you give us a  bad name dude every fucking time you're like stay the fuck out you're you're with us you're like stay  the fuck out of their business stay out i'm tired of being worried please let the savages kill  themselves is actually your direct quotes let the savages kill themselves yes yes but now you want to  fucking jump because obama didn't say shit now you want to attack him because he's fucking just letting 
[01:08:00]  the savages kill themselves you're just a bad fucking queer jesus christ first of all as far  as japan is concerned i don't i've never considered them savages are you talking about the middle east  no he's talking about the libyan situation okay i'm talking about qaddafi he's the one that said  qaddafi needs to go he said that yes and and and these these these the rebels need some type of 
[01:08:30]  protection from qaddafi's uh air air air support and i'm not saying i said i said this i'm not saying  direct american military intervention but how about a united nations no fly zone uh or working with the  united nations or do or saying something how about how about this how about obama gives an impassioned  speech like he did when he was fucking campaigning for his own ass how about that he gives any speech  that sounds like he has passion about holding this fucking job he had passion when he was running 
[01:09:00]  for the job the second he got it we get obama reading a teleprompter with other people writing  shit listen i can yell he stinks i'm not going to okay if he if he does that you're going to sit there  and say here's another shit speech that does nothing he's doing exactly what you want to do he's  saying the fuck out of it he's not doing shit let them kill themselves remember they're fucking  savages let them kill themselves that's what you say and how about how how about yes let them kill 
[01:09:30]  themselves right right then then what happens to the country and what happens to the middle east over  there and the stability of our oil that we do need you have your fucking guns who cares oh well good  point good point i could take oil yes dirt shit all right i'm not all right sir that's all right  all right all right all right i like being a cunt to some people all right all right that man was  infuriated i think that means we got to take a break uh yeah brooklyn i think we might go to break

Ah  He's dead  He's dead  He's got  I know  No I know  But that's saying  He was on the down low  Like was he on the down low  Not the down low  White people version 
[01:17:30]  The down low  Black people version  Where you're  You act straight  But you know  You're with your homies  And you might suck a dick  I don't know  I don't know  I guess  I wasn't sure what you were asking  I thought for a second  You were wondering  If E-Z-E was still alive  It's like  Where's E-Z?  I'm pretty sure  He's dead  No one's pulling that shit  Like he's still alive  Or he's gonna come back  Or anything  Yeah we know that  He's no Tupac  Oh yeah  Yeah  It's kind of funny 
[01:18:00]  You bring up E-Z-E  Because it was  It was  Well geez  Let's see  1995  Someone do some quick math  15  16 years ago  Today  That it was  Public knowledge  I suppose  That he had AIDS  Wow  Yeah March 16  It came out  Fuck  And that's when  March 1695  And that was a death sentence  Oh yeah  And he had AIDS  He didn't even have HIV  When he announced  It was like  He has the AIDS  Yeah it has moved on  This guy  Joey in  S-O-M-D  On Twitter 
[01:18:30]  You guys realize  That Carlin lives on  Japan equals  His bid on people  Wanting the fire to burn  Just a bit more  Or longer  Yeah we should find that  Because Carlin  Carlin just had a great take  On everything always  A couple things happening  In New York  That just affects  Everybody in the end  It really does  First of all  There's people trying  To get a law passed  I think it's a law  Well it's co-ops though  So I don't know  They have their own  Laws right  Or rules 
[01:19:00]  Rules and regulations  I try to get into a co-op  But because I do this radio show  With my pal Anthony  They said no  They didn't want me man  Show business people  They're not allowed  To deny you by the way  Yeah  They're not allowed to  So I guess you could  Technically fight it  But it would be a pain in the ass  Then you're living in a building  Where everyone hates you  But these co-ops  Are  They're just  You want to talk about cunts  Why yeah  Why even  Especially in New York  Trying to get in that  Shit fucking  Bunch of twats  Political crap  But 
[01:19:30]  They want  They want to pass  Some kind of law  Or co-op law  I don't know  Where  You're not allowed  To smoke in your own apartment  That's  That's bizarre  That's fucked up  Smoking will be  Completely banned  In our lifetime  Yeah  But it's just fucked up  That now they're trying to  Control what you do  In your own fucking home  Yeah  I was listening to  A little conversation  With the gentleman  That owns Zippo  The company Zippo  That makes the lighters 
[01:20:00]  And shit  And they're gonna have to  Like start  Diversifying into  A whole new area  Same thing  You hear that shit  Well cause  I was reading something  The other day  A pack a day smokers  Has come down tremendously  Yeah  And I guess as a result  That people aren't smoking  So much anymore  The lighter market  Yeah  They don't need  The lighters  Is crumbling now  So Zippo apparently bought  There was a company  In  I almost said Italia  In Italia  There was a company  In Italy  That held the trademark  On Zippo 
[01:20:30]  The name Zippo  And they manufactured  Glasses  And handbags  And wallets  And shit like that  So they just bought  Them out  And figured  Fuck it  Well we gotta do  Something else  Yeah cause it's  The name recognition  Is great  You know  Even though I don't smoke  A good Zippo lighter  Is just a cool  Fucking thing  Yeah  It's a cool thing  To have  But mostly  Smokers  Yeah smokers  Are the ones  Why wouldn't they  Diversify by now  And how are they  Gonna diversify  They wanna get into  Other things like  Even like knives 
[01:21:00]  I think  Some  Just the Zippo name  Can go on other  Yeah they wanna put it  On like watches  They wanna become like  They wanna be like  Fossil  Yeah fossil  They wanna have like  Little hats and bags  Swiss Army's another one  That diversified into  Other things  I got Zippo stock  You're telling me  This isn't gonna be good  You got Zippo stock  I got Zippo stock  Well that's good  Cause they bought  They bought Ronson  Alright  Ronson  Bought their competition  Good old Ronson  Ronson  Ronson  So you got that  Going on with  They're trying to  Make it illegal 
[01:21:30]  For you to smoke  In your own apartment  If you're in a co-op  Damn  And then this is  Something that  Certainly affects me  I've seen this  They're doing a ticket  Blitz on Central Park  Bikers  This is  This is where  Our world is going  Because the economy  Is so bad  You got this  Twat that runs  This city  Mayor Bloomberg  We've made it  Very clear  We don't like  This guy  At all  His approval rating  Is down lowest  It's been since  He's been mayor  What I don't  Understand is  I live in New York City 
[01:22:00]  So I have to pay  An extra tax  I got federal  State  And city  I am paying  My taxes  A lot  At least once you pay  That though  You're done  And the money you have  Is all yours  Right  Until you go to  Buy something  And there's nothing  We can do about this  So they're getting  A shitload of money  From everybody  And because they  Don't know how to  Spend it properly  They need to figure  Out other ways  To make money  Off us  Yeah  So they're coming up  With just silly  Dumb laws  And surcharges  And new taxes 
[01:22:30]  And all  It drives me insane  And it's gotten  This bad  Where Central Park  Is pretty much  A six mile loop  On the outside  And then you got  All the park area  In the middle  Obviously  And the six mile loop  Is used by  Bikers  Joggers  Inline skaters  What have you  Oh  I thought you were  Going to mention  Another thing  And it's used  For exercise  Where you get  You go on this loop  And you try to  Bike as hard as you can  Run as hard as you can 
[01:23:00]  Inline skate  As hard as you can  So this  This twat of a mayor  I don't blame the NYPD  Because they're doing  They  You know  They got  Tell them what to do  They got their orders  But the NYPD  Is putting the brakes  On cyclists  Who not wanting  To spoil their fun  In quotes  This asshole writes  Recklessly blow through  Red lights in Central Park  Oh my god  That sounds very dangerous  Hopi  So the cops are out  In force giving tickets  Left and right  To bikers  But I would assume 
[01:23:30]  They're going to do it  To the joggers  And everybody else  If you're not obeying  The red lights  Now the red lights  Are in Central Park  Because it is a  Six mile loop  Of a road  The problem is  Most of the time  Central Park  Most of the park  Is closed to traffic  Yeah  So these lights  Are going red  Green  Yellow  Da da da da da  But there's no one  On the road  For nothing  For no reason  Now the thought  Is that  Bikes are flying  Through these lights  And they can be  Hitting pedestrians  And stuff  The problem is 
[01:24:00]  The pedestrians  Cross wherever  The fuck they want  Anyway  Because there's no cars  Right  So they're just  Crossing willy nilly  Wherever the fuck  They want  To begin with  And secondly  In most cases  The bike guys  Know exactly  What they're doing  And they're blowing  Through red lights  Because the cars  Are on the road  And there's no  Pedestrians crossing  The street  But that's not good  Enough  There's cops  Waiting there  And giving a lot  Of tickets  To guys  Blowing through  These lights  And the only reason  Is to make  More fucking money  For the city  It's under the guise  Of being safe  Like we're making 
[01:24:30]  People safer  And no they're not  They're just  Collecting money  It's a bicycle tax  Right  And if you're trying  If you're like  A workout guy  Or gal  And you're trying  To get some exercise  There's not many places  You could do that  Outdoors in New York City  Do you understand  So that's why  They have tried  To make Central Park  The place to go  To get some exercise  On your bike  Jogging  Whatever  And now they're  Going to like  Force people  To stop at these lights  That have no business  Turning red to green 
[01:25:00]  Half the time  Yeah they shut it down  In traffic  And then they  Give tickets  To the bicycles  It's unbelievable  It doesn't make sense  It's unbelievable  What you do is  You make a judgment call  You're flying on your bike  You're trying to get  A workout in  And you see the light  Turning red  There's no cars  On the road  And you see no pedestrians  What are you going to do  Of course you're going to  Fly by the light  But they got the cop  Waiting by  And they're pulling you over  And going nope  That's not good  At all for anybody  You went through that red light  Yeah I'm on a bicycle 
[01:25:30]  Shut up  And if it was for true safety  Then maybe I would understand  But it's not  Like you said  It's a way to make more money  For the fucking city  Because they don't know  How to spend our tax money  Whatsoever  Properly  So they're ticket blitzing  The hell out of the bike guys  We're city scams  And I'm sure they'll do it  With the joggers  If you're jogging  You know how much of a pain in the ass  I don't know if you were ever a runner  You know how much of a pain in the ass  It is if you start your run  And now you've got to stop  At every fucking red light  You see the people running  Where they have to stop at a light 
[01:26:00]  And they keep running in place  And look real silly  Yeah  They look silly  Get your legs going  $270 ticket for running a red light  Enforcing red lights at crosswalks  Is meaningless  Pedestrians cross wherever they want  That's the truth  If they want to make money  You know get those guys  Leave us alone man  Because we use that  As a good six mile track  To get a good you know  Good workout in  Then they would be bitching  About the fact that they  Get tickets for crossing the street 
[01:26:30]  When no one's coming  A bike is a vehicle  And the traffic law applies  You said Captain Phillip  Wishnia  Commanding officer  Of the Central Park Precinct  He doesn't believe that  He's doing  There's dirty work  Company line  Company line  I'm a fan of the NYPD  I don't fuck with those guys  But this is just  This is just ridiculous  That they're enforcing this  It's completely ridiculous  Yeah  Eventually you're not going to be able  To do fucking anything  How much longer is  Bloomberg in there?  I don't know  He might make a new law  Where he gets a fourth term 
[01:27:00]  I don't know  He seems to be one of these guys  That makes his own  That'd be interesting  His own rules  He already repealed that one  Right  Where you know  It was just long enough  For him to get a third term  Right  And then he made sure  You know  That no one else will have that  What a fuck  No one sees this guy  For what he is  And they haven't given up  On the license plate  For bikes yet  You know  No?  There's other towns  Trying it  Really?  Yeah  They haven't given up on that  And eventually  You mean the little ones  With your names on them  That you buy in the station  I remember that  You can never find Anthony 
[01:27:30]  No, Greg with two G's  Was a tough one  Tough one to find  Really tough  They had the Greg  With the one G at the end  That's not good enough for me  My mom wanted it  To be a little different  I guess  It's like they never  Everything that had a name on it  It was  Anthony  It popped up occasionally  But you always felt bad  For kids with names  That just were never there  Why occasionally?  Anthony probably sold out  Was your problem  That was my problem  Yeah  It would sell out  That's a popular name  So I'm sure they had  Anthony on everything  And Disney and stuff  And those  Always sold out  Yeah, and those gift shops 
[01:28:00]  So  Yes  That shit drives me  Fucking insane though  The crap they're doing  Just to make a little more money  That has nothing  To do with safety  You know  I told you about  The asshole that gave me a ticket  Because I had my bike on a pier  On the west side of Manhattan  Yeah  Because I was probably doing  Three miles an hour  On my bike  I was  I was literally  The bike was literally  Going forward slightly  But I was sitting on the bike  Because it's easier  Than fucking walking  Yeah  And people that were jogging 
[01:28:30]  That day  Jogged past my bike  And the little kids  Ran past my bike  But I was the fucking problem  You're the bad guy  Because I'm still sitting  On my bike  And this asshole  Gave me a fucking ticket  Because it was just  Another way to get some money  Into the  You know  For the city  Unbelievable  Had nothing to do with safety  If I was like  Flying down the pier  Then maybe  Even at that point  I would say no  But at least  At least  It looks like maybe  I was dangering people  Yeah  There are some intersections now 
[01:29:00]  Where  You start pulling up to them  And the lights turning red  And it looks like  Strobe lights are going  It looks like a disco  From the  The traffic cams  Yeah  That are going off  Yeah  Constantly just  Blap blap blap  Blap flashing  People's plates  Supposedly New York  Only has 50 of those  Right now  Really  I was talking to someone  About that  Two days ago  Because there's one  In my neighborhood  And someone was  Getting ready to blow  Through that  I'm like  Stop  Right now  You're going to get it  You know  The cameras are right 
[01:29:30]  The fuck there  Yep  And then someone  Was telling me  There's only 50 right now  That's  They're only allowing 50  I forget exactly  Oh they only allow 50  They're only allowing 50  But then I said to the guy  Well when they say  We're only going to allow 50  A year or two goes by  And then they're going to allow 100  Then they're going to allow 150  It's too late now  Oh yeah  Those things will be flashing  All over the place  And if they had it their way  They would have one of those  On every fucking corner  Because it's a great money maker  For the city  It really is  And half the time  You know you're not  Fucking with anyone  If you go through a light 
[01:30:00]  At the last second  And you pay it  Because you feel like  You feel like you won  Because you don't get points  On your license  Right  You just get the ticket  You got to pay money  Right  If you get pulled over for it  And get a ticket  Then you get points  On your license  Right  But that one  So you're like  I'll just pay it  Fuck it  Yeah  I was going to fight that  And they know that  They certainly do  Illegal to smoke in your car  In Minnesota  That's impossible 
[01:30:30]  That can't be possible  Let me say  How to show on Georgia  And I hate cigarette smoke  I'm not a fan of it  But I see  I see what it does  To this country  You should be allowed  To smoke outside still  That doesn't affect us  In your house  In your car  I know they want to  Take it away from  People smoking in cars  With kids in the car  Now that  Again  I just hate  The government  Stepping in  Mad  When it comes to  People's health  And this guy's just  Going to whistle for a while 
[01:31:00]  People's health  And the health  Of their children  And stuff  You could say  Look we're helping people out  But on the other hand  You could say  You know  People do have the freedom  To fuck up  And just be  The shitheads  And parent badly  And they do have  The freedom to do that  Let's say hi to  Yeah it's Sean  Go ahead Sean  Hey guys  And some of the larger  Counties in Minnesota  They've made it illegal  To be smoking  On county ground  Which just means  In general  Anywhere in the county  It's illegal to smoke  Even if you're in your car 
[01:31:30]  On the street  With your windows up  Wow  So then  You know  We follow this logic  Because obviously  This is a health thing  With cigarettes  They should start  Banning soda  And all that too  Right  Everything is deadly  Everything's deadly  They should ban  Fucking  Casino buses  Holy shit  Ban those things  Especially from Chinatown  Yeah  Wow  They don't want you  I know you're a fan  Of the casino  But just bear with me 
[01:32:00]  They don't want you  Smoking in casinos  But they think  Casinos are okay  Yeah  And in a lot of cases  The casino itself  Is way more damaging  Than the cigarette smoke  You're fucking  Inhaling into your lungs  My friend  Devastating your life  It devastates  A lot of people's lives  That's the shit  That drives me nuts  Let's ban smoking  In casinos  And not acknowledge  That casinos  Could be bad  For a lot of people  Yeah  It's just  It's the hypocrisy  That drives me nuts 
[01:32:30]  Whatever  I don't care  If there are casinos  Around  I really don't  How to that  But then to like  Ban smoking  You see how ridiculous  That is  How booze is legal  Is beyond me too  You know  Well because it makes  A lot of money  For the country  That's all  I know  And they tried  To make it illegal  Once and all it did  Was make organized crime  Right  A huge force  To be reckoned with  But if your whole  Take on it  Is we're making  Things illegal  Or keeping things  Legal 
[01:33:00]  Based on  Health concerns  Alcohol should be  The first thing  On the list  That you take off  It's worse than weed  It's a lot worse  Than weed for you  Yeah but weed's illegal  That argument  Makes no sense  Yeah it doesn't make sense  Of course it doesn't  Make sense  It's just  It's just bizarre  So I'm going to say  There's more than 50 cameras  So my knowledge on that  Is way off  George what do you got  On that  Hey Opie  I drive a truck  Around the city  And there's cameras  Are all over the place 
[01:33:30]  It's not 50 cameras  The fines are only $50  That's just for now  You know they're going  To jack them up  In a little while  How do you know  There's more than 50  I see them all over the place  And that's just in Queens  As many as I see in Queens  And Manhattan  There's got to be  A lot more than 50  My thought on that is  You know  Now that the technology  Is getting cheaper  It's going to be on every  Every corner  I think that was the only reason  That was preventing it  From being on every corner  Yeah the first ones  With these giant boxes  Yeah the technology  Was way too complicated 
[01:34:00]  And too expensive  But as the costs come down  You're going to see that  On every fucking corner  Yeah  Why wouldn't they  What about the  You know the guys  That are driving off hours  When you know you can blow  Through a million lights  To get to work  Or wherever you're going  Sooner  Because there's no one around  I do that  You do it in the morning  All the time  Of course you do  All the time  There's no one on the road  Why am I waiting  Right  You look around  Make sure no one's coming  Yeah  Hey Hopi  Yeah  Can I tell you something  About the bike thing  In Central Park  Yeah go ahead  It's not just Central Park 
[01:34:30]  It's a whole citywide crackdown  And it's more about  Making money  It's like a backlash  Because of all those  Bike lanes they put in  They give people  On bicycle tickets  For not having a bell  Not having reflectors  Not signaling  When they change lanes  All sorts of bullshit  That's probably why  They made the bike lanes  In the actual roads  Of Manhattan  Just so they could  Catch more people  You'd think they did  A good thing  For certain people  Like hey use your bike  Instead of your car  Save a little money  Oh thanks  They probably made  The bike lanes  Now that I think about it  I like this thought George 
[01:35:00]  Just to get fucking  Some tickets written  More cash  Yeah cause just like  We were talking about  If you're on a bike  In Manhattan  On the actual streets  Not inside Central Park  You're gonna blow by  A bunch of those lights  If no one's around  Fuck yeah  And that's why  You need the license plates  Cause then when the cameras  Take a picture of your bike  They wanna know who's  They know where to send the ticket  Wow  How much money  Do they need from us  That's exactly what it is too  How much money  Do they need  I didn't even think of that  Just tell me how much money  You need  And then just take it now 
[01:35:30]  They do  It's called taxes  No they don't  They need more  Yeah  They would be like  Okay really  You wanna know  We need it all  We just need it all  Could you just give us  All your money  And then just try your best  To deal with your life  Thank you  There's no way  There's speed cameras  And we're still gonna be broke  Do we have speed cameras yet  Speed cameras  I haven't heard of that  In Tennessee  We got speed cameras  Cody  Yeah you know  Just a couple things  You know here in Tennessee  The red light cameras  Become such a big business 
[01:36:00]  That now  Now the counties  Don't actually have to pay for it  What happens is  These third party companies  Actually come in  And install the cameras for free  And they actually monitor  And then the county  Actually gets a  Proceeds of the  Of the  The ticket sales  So there's no  Out of pocket expense  For  For  Wow  Cameras  And  Now at least  In my county  They've started putting up  These speed cameras  I know back in the 90's  When I started to drive  It used to be vans  Sitting on the side of the road  But now they actually  Have these cameras  That if you exceed over 
[01:36:30]  Five or six miles  Over the speed limit  They'll actually take your picture  And you'll get a nice little  Ticket in the mail  Oh my god  At a $120 ticket  What's the speed limit?  Bad varies  You know  Between 35 and 40 miles per hour  We have a big race coming up  So we have about  100,000 people coming up  Bristol here in a little bit  So  So they're gonna get  Bristol, Tennessee  Imagine they start  Giving you speed tickets  On like the New Jersey  Turnpike and stuff  When you know  You could be going 80  No problem  Well that's why  Everybody thought  The easy pass 
[01:37:00]  Would be one of those things  Where they would time you  From point A to point B  And see if you  Yeah  But  Man we'll see  I would have gotten  One of these speeding tickets  If it was around now  So I know the roads  It's not on  Right  Northern State Parkway  The Grand Central  And the Expressway  Alright bro  Thank you  Such a piss off  The constant pickpocketing  By the fucking government  Yeah the Central Park thing  It's ridiculous  Because I mean  Rotsy bastards 
[01:37:30]  Most people  Most people get on their bike  Not to like sightsee  You're trying to work out  Instead of being in a fucking sweaty gym  You know  There are the occasional fucking  Oh there's assholes on this  Slowly going around  Hey it's the park  We'll take a yellow ride  Well they rent bikes  To the tourists  And you see them  Because they do have  Some weird license plate on it  I forget what it says  Asshole  Big ridiculous  You know  Handlebars way up here  What about the tricycle  Can you rent the tricycle  But those 
[01:38:00]  You know  Come on  The big crazy person  The big crazy person  In town tricycle  Yeah  That's every nut guy  That you know  From the town  Oh that's crazy John  You know  Yeah he goes  Behind the dumpster  He goes by the dumpsters  And pigs  That's anybody  That rides that big tricycle  Is crazy  Yeah  Why can't they figure out  Two wheels  Why do they have to go with three  Because they're crazy  Someone figured out  Wait I could bounce on this 
[01:38:30]  This is good  I could stop  And fill up my dumpster  Uh huh  Newark made three million dollars  Off traffic cams last year  And that's all  Really  That's all they need to hear  And go wow  This is working  Let's get more traffic cameras  Out there  Yeah  What the fuck  Mike in Jersey  Oh what the Christ  Hey buddy  I actually watched the news yesterday  And they did a story  On how the traffic  The red light cams  In Newark New Jersey  Made three million dollars  In revenue  So now they're gonna add 
[01:39:00]  More cameras  And uh  I mean that's just ridiculous  And Ope you said  About the traffic cameras  On the turnpike  Yeah  On 95  I got a ticket  About three weeks ago  For doing 60  In a construction zone  Because now those  Construction zones  Have little cameras  Set up on cones  To catch you speeding by them  Holy  No  Yep  That's some new  Fucking news  Sneaky  Yep and then  They told me that  If I didn't pay the fine  They'd uh  Give me three points  On my license  Wow  That is sneaky shit 
[01:39:30]  Damn  Cause now what you're gonna see  If they are able to do that  They're gonna have  Almost fake  Construction areas  That's bullshit  Wow  You gotta take the power back  Well  Uh  Good luck  What I ask  What I would love to ask  The uh  The officials in Newark  So you made  Three million dollars  On traffic camera  Tickets last year  How many accidents  Does that uh  Prevent  I wonder  It would be very easy  To see the stats  Before the cameras  And afterwards  Yeah  I bet you  I bet you  It's minimal at best 
[01:40:00]  At best  Uh  Nassau County  That's where Ann lives  Uh  Mark in Long Island  What do you got  I run uh  Northern Boulevard  Every morning  And there's one  At 107  There's one at  Glencove Road  And I  My office is in  Lakeville Road  There's one at  Union Carpike  There's one  Fucking Market Avenue  They're all over  Nassau County now  Yeah the uh  There's one at  Glencove Road  Uh  If you're heading north  Right before the expressway  That's a bad one  That's a bad one  I see that one  Flicking all the time

[01:41:30]  Alright sir  Thank you  One more  This guy's  Basically saying  You don't seem  To understand taxes  Go ahead  Buck in  The Bronx  Yeah what's up guys  How you doing  Hey  Love you guys  But uh  Every time you guys  Talk about this situation  Where we're paying  More and more for things  Nobody likes it  But it's the fact  Of a recession  When you have a recession  What happens is  Revenue  Fucking lemming  No choice  But to  But to raise  You have no choice  But to raise prices  On things  To make up that money  Oh you're just a lemming 
[01:42:00]  Right  You're a lemming  Why is that  We  It should be  That we pay enough taxes  No matter what the fuck  The economy's doing  Do you understand  How much fucking money  They have been getting  Off us forever  Why is that  Why do you think  That what we  It should be recession proof  To be completely honest  With you  With the amount of money  We fucking give the government  It's waste  Your taxes would be higher  Oh you're  You're a lemming  To believe  It's waste  What you're saying  We paid 50% tax  Income tax 
[01:42:30]  In this country  Up until the last 20 years  We're paying the lowest taxes  We've ever paid  Oh  Wow  That's  Well  Give yourself a fucking bell  Well I'm just saying  Look at you  Rah rah  For the government  Yay  Government  Good  Yay  Yay  Let them rape you up the ass  Yay  Yay  Let them rape you up the ass  Yeah  If we're paying the lowest income tax  We've ever paid  Then they're tacking it on everything else  Estate taxes  Property taxes 
[01:43:00]  All that other shit  Believe me  They're not just saying  Hey look  We're being nice guys  And cutting your fucking taxes  And plus  Just in our lifetime  The amount of surcharges  And surtax  Or whatever the fuck  Yeah  Syntax  Whatever the fuck they call it  Leisure passes  That I gotta buy  To go to fucking parks  That I pay taxes  To maintain  And now I gotta buy  A leisure pass  Just to go to it  Right  What the fuck is that about  Right  You just  Yeah  All that is added on  To this low level of taxes  We're paying  Stop being a lemming  It's the shitty reality 
[01:43:30]  It's the shitty reality  That's all it is  The shitty reality  Is the misappropriation  And waste  And fucking pocket  Filling  Of these  Crooked  Fuck politicians  Of course  That don't do the right thing  And actually change stuff  And spend the money wisely  What's this leisure pass about?  Oh that's Nassau County  To get  To use any of your parks  Like name some of the parks  In Nassau County  Everything  How about the beaches  Down the  On the south shore 
[01:44:00]  North shore beaches  Yeah  Shooting range  Ball fields  If you want to use them  You need to buy a leisure pass  Now to use these things  And by the way  You pay fucking taxes  To use the fucking things  But now you gotta buy  A leisure pass  See Buck  So keep  Buck you're bothersome  I don't feel like  Getting all fucking uptight today  But you're bothersome  That you're just buying  The fucking company line  I'm not buying  They're fucking raping us 
[01:44:30]  Don't you understand that?  Okay  This is way better  Than telling dick jokes  What they're fucking doing to us  Thanks Buck  Are you serious?  Yeah  Is what?  I have no idea  Isn't it the regular price?  No  So now they're adding on  To the regular price  Because you don't have  The leisure license?  I think the range  You can't even use the range  Without a leisure pass  If you're  Or you gotta pay the  Non-resident fee  Non-resident fee  It's twice as much  Yeah twice as much  Not like these are  Exorbitant fees 
[01:45:00]  But I mean  The point  It adds up  It adds up  Here and there  And everywhere else  It's all the fucking  Just  The way they rape you  One we bring up all the time  The taxis  Surcharge  When gas was through the roof  A few years ago  That thing will never go away  Then it just doesn't go away  No  No  Sometimes it goes away  Sometimes it don't go away  I used to have this dumb little  When you live in New York  There's cab rides you do  Just to get into  You know  Certain areas quickly  Instead of walking  Yeah  And in my case  It was 
[01:45:30]  It was a four dollar cab ride  So I give the guy five  And he's like  Yeah whatever  It's just a quick cab ride  Here's five bucks  Thank you for getting me  Up the hill basically  Right  That same ride is  Close to ten dollars now  It's ridiculous  Fucking amazing  Because of the surcharges  And everything else  They tacked on  Unbelievable  But the leisure pass  Are you  The leisure pass  I'm getting a leisure pass  Yeah I was like  Oh leisure pass  And your taxes  You're supposed to pay  For that to begin with  It's called a tax  Yeah  Where's the logic there  And how do they get that through  Everything goes through 
[01:46:00]  Because it's the will  Of the people right  You're representing the people  So it must be  What everyone wants  And how that fucking changed  Is beyond me  And the beauty of the leisure pass  Of course if you don't have  The leisure pass on you  As you're playing a dumb game  Of softball on a Sunday morning  Now you're going to get fined  For not having the leisure pass  You need a leisure pass  And that fine will be way more  Than the actual pass itself  Right  Yeah to pay to get in there  You'd have to pay a non-resident fee  Because it'll be a  What do they call it  Administration fee  Yes 
[01:46:30]  Administration fee  Your fine was 50 cents  For not paying the toll  On the Garden State Parkway  But the administration fee  Is $200  Oh really  So you owe $200 and 50 cents  Who's getting that  The fucking  The scrub that processes it  No one's outraged  But I think people are outraged  But we just don't know  What the fuck to do  How do you change anything  Yeah  How do you change that  The administration fee  Unbelievable  They're shortening yellow lights 
[01:47:00]  In Chicago to catch you  Who comes up with these  I don't doubt it  Mark in Chicago  Go ahead  I don't doubt it  Yeah they're shortening  The yellow lights  Because they can get  More red light tickets  Brilliant  Also our city  Sold our parking meters  To the Russian mafia  LAZ parking  I think you guys got them  In New York  I don't know  I know now  A quarter is maybe  Two minutes in New York  I think  I think a quarter is like 
[01:47:30]  Two and a half minutes  I think  Two and a half minutes  I'm not  Yeah  It gives you enough time  To get another quarter  Yeah basically  They're shortening yellow lights  You know what  Whoever came up with that  Brilliant  Brilliant idea  Because we're all used to  What a yellow light is  A certain amount  And you're a dumb head  You're like  You can figure this  I got it  You're 200 feet  From that fucking light  It's going yellow  You know you got it  Yeah  And now they shorten it  Without even telling you  Hey wait a minute  Fucking everybody over 
[01:48:00]  You fucked my rhythm up here  Right  Oh what a bunch of assholes  They have speed traps  Set off on the  Bronx River Parkway now  Really  I didn't know  Half this shit  City gives camera  Companies a cut  From tickets  Yeah it's  We're just fucked  Oh here's  Here's a good one  Coming out of Boston  Alex in Boston  Go ahead  Hey guys  A few months ago  There was a news story  About a city  That had to give back  Like six months  Worth of tickets  Because the guy  That reviews the pictures 
[01:48:30]  On the cameras  Been dead for six months  But his signature  Was on the bottom  Of every ticket  A victory for the common man  That's right  Very good  Thank you sir  How did it happen  Alright  Hey did we  Did we find that  George Carlin bit  How long is it  Oh four months  It's nice  This is  This is very timely  Even though  Yeah  Mr. Carlin is dead  But he's still  Talking for the world  He spoke well beyond 
[01:49:00]  His years  He sure did  Yes yes  Still pertinent  So did Bill Hicks  I saw the Bill Hicks  Documentary  Yeah  It's not going to be  For everyone  But fans of Bill Hicks  Will certainly like it  Yeah I got to see that one  And comedy fans in general  Will like it  But they don't have  A lot of video  Of Bill Hicks  When he's not on stage  So they filled it in  With this  This great new technology  They use with the photographs  Yeah  More than Ken Burns  Yeah  It's like Ken Burns  Ramped up a little bit  Yeah 
[01:49:30]  They're able to make it  Put it on different 3D levels  Yeah they make them  Look like 3D  Yeah it kind of looks like  Because they blur the background  And they put something  In the foreground  In focus  And they could pass by  Each other real slow  So it looks like  It's moving in a different direction  You got it  You got it  Yeah yeah  You got it  That's a great little technique  It really is  Well they certainly love  That technique  In the Bill Hicks documentary  Yeah they use it a lot  You see a lot of that  Yeah  They could do this weird  Even though they're not film  They could do like  A depth of field thing  Where you know 
[01:50:00]  They put the front  Out of focus  And then the background  Is in focus  Again so it almost looks like  Cameras moving through  Real space  We're so used to it now  Because if you have iMovie  Everyone has used  The Ken Burns effect  Yeah yeah  You don't realize  That guy was brilliant  For just figuring that out  Just coming out of a way  He's going to make a documentary  Just using still pictures  And moving the pictures around  When we were growing up  And they had these documentaries  Where they just had pictures  Civil war or whatever  Yeah yeah  They just showed the picture  That was it  And then he figured out  Like no just focus on  A little bit of the picture  A little bit of the picture  And move out 
[01:50:30]  Showing the rest of it  As you talk about it  Well then like  There's a picture of a battle sequence  Yeah  And it'll show one side  Use some sound effects  And then quickly go over  To the other side of the picture  And it's like  Oh they're fighting  It's a war  Yeah  It's a still picture  But before that  It would have just been  The whole picture  It would have just shown the whole picture  Like how did he figure that out  It's a slow reveal now  You get like  Oh they're fighting  It works perfectly  So I love it  Alright  That's cool shit  And it's all available  To people now  That's just  You used to have nothing  Available to you  Now every bit of 
[01:51:00]  Hollywood technology  Is like  Here you go  Take it away  Showing that  They had nothing special  No  Everyone could do it now  It's great  Steven Spielberg  Wasn't special  Yeah  George Lucas  Wasn't special  Who doesn't have a green screen  In their house  Come on  Exactly  Stupid little models  Yeah  How would you spend your time  With little models  Blowing over to firecrackers  Right  Was it firecrackers?  Yeah  They would like  Throw fireworks  On top of the  The mock-up of the Death Star 
[01:51:30]  To make just explosions  Oh that's classic  While they flew the camera through  I forgot all that stuff  I remember watching  The making of Star Wars  That's great  When I was a child  George Carlin to break  I think it is certainly  Apparent by now  That one of the things  I enjoy in life  Is excess  I like things  That are excessive  I like excessive behavior  Excessive language  Excessive violence  It's fun  It's interesting  It's exciting  I like it when  Nature is excessive 
[01:52:00]  That's why I like  Natural disasters  All these natural disasters  Have been going on  I fucking love them  I can't get enough of them  Oh when nature is going crazy  Throwing things around  Scaring people  And destroying property  I'm a happy fucking guy  I'm a happy fucking guy  I look at it this way  For centuries now  Man has done everything he can  To destroy  Defile  And interfere with nature  Clear cutting forests 
[01:52:30]  Strip mining mountains  Poisoning the atmosphere  Overfishing the oceans  Polluting rivers and lakes  Destroying wetlands  And aquifers  So when nature strikes back  And smacks man in the head  And kicks him in the nuts  I enjoy that  I have absolutely no sympathy  For human beings whatsoever  None  And no matter what kind of problem  Humans are facing  Whether it's natural  Or man made  I always hope it gets worse  Don't you? 
[01:53:00]  Don't you?  Don't you have a part of you  A part of you  That secretly hopes  Everything gets worse  When you see a big fire on TV  Don't you hope it spreads?  Don't you hope it gets  Completely out of control  And burns down six counties?  You don't root for the firemen  Do you?  I mean I don't want them  To get hurt or nothing  But I don't want them  Putting out my fire  That's my fire  That's nature 
[01:53:30]  Showing off  And having fun  I like fires  You know something else I like?  Those spring floods  In the Midwest  Aren't they great?  Like clockwork  Spring floods  In the Midwest  But I'm starting to notice  I'm starting to catch on  That every year  It's the same story  Another flood  In the same place  With the same people  On the same river  Same fucking people  And these people do not move  They will not fucking move  They repaint  Put down new carpeting 
[01:54:00]  And wallpaper  And they move right back  Into the same fucking house  On the flood plain  Next to the river  And then they wonder  Why grandma's floating downstream  With the parakeet on her head  Fourth time  Again  Fourth fucking time  There's no learning curve  With these people  It's very hard  To feel sorry for them  Every year  Same people  Same rowboats  Out there paddling around  Rescuing a chicken  What the fuck  Kind of a life is that? 
[01:54:30]  Well our kids love it here  Oh really?  What do they got?  Gills?  And while they're showing  All that shit on the screen  The announcer is saying  To me  It's been raining steadily  For three months now  The ground can't hold  Any more water  The river is cresting  Higher than it has  In two centuries  The levees have washed away  And I just hope  It keeps raining  And raining  And raining  And raining  And raining  And raining  And raining  And raining  And raining  And raining  And raining 
[01:55:00]  And raining  And raining  And it rains steadily  For five years  And then after that  For ten years  It's cloudy  With occasional showers  And the river  Never returns  To its natural banks  It becomes  A completely new river  And the borders  Of three states  Have to be changed  And all the maps  And atlases  Have to be redrawn  And reprinted  And no one's couch  Ever completely dries out  For years and years 
[01:55:30]  Every time they sit down  There's always a little  Squish  Dan, Linda  Come on in you guys  Have a seat  Squish  Squish  I like that  The virus  Get in touch  With the Opie and Anthony  Show  866-WOW  1-WOW  Send your feedback  To feedback  At Opie and Anthony  Dot com  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  We got an update  On the red light cameras  Anthony  Yeah  Club Soda 
[01:56:00]  Kenny  Who was law enforcement  For many many years  Decided to take  This little project on  Did a little research online  Read a New York Times article  And decided  They're pretty  They're pretty  Yes  I was a victim  Of a red light camera ticket  Were you?  Yes I was  Did you fight it?  I tried to yes  I guess you lost  I did  Yeah  Because they have the picture  Well  Can't you just say  Someone else was driving my car?  It doesn't matter  Find that person  The registered owner  Is responsible for 
[01:56:30]  Yeah I know  It's a no point violation  That's why you don't get points  Because it's like  Well we don't care  If it's you or not you  It's your car  Driving through there  It's just to find  To make money for the city  Yeah  Because if they really cared  About making you drive better  They would make sure  You get points  Because when you get points  That's what really  Scares the fuck out of you  To slow the fuck  Yes  Well according to  New York City Department  Of Transportation website  Their frequently asked questions  Studies have shown  A 40% decrease  In the total number  Of incidents 
[01:57:00]  Of motorists  Going through  Red lights  At the locations  Where cameras  Have been installed  Oh no  So uh  That means fewer accidents  Making New York City  A safer place  For pedestrians  And motorists  Pedestrians  Most of them  Deserve to be hit  Pedestrians  Should take cars  But they don't tell you  What happens to the  Millions of dollars  That the city gets  Yeah where is it going  Yeah  Where does that go  How do you know 
[01:57:30]  It's millions of dollars  What do you got on that  Kenny  Well it's  This continues  And you can get it  Right on the website  Right  Since the red light  Camera program  Has been instituted  In December 1993  More than 4 million  Summonses  Have been issued  And this is just  Through 2007  Wow  That's 14 years  Yeah  Alright so  And that's  $50 a ticket  Times 4 million  So I'm not good  At math  That's 200 million  That's a lot of money  So the city's made  $200 million  On red light cameras 
[01:58:00]  So where's that money  Yeah  Why do we have to hear  That the city's broke  Why do we have to  Continue to hear  That the city  And the state  Is broke  Where's that  200 million  That's money coming in  That's one little thing  Where is it  Where's that  200 million  Let's start there  And GH  You are absolutely  Correct in saying  That there was  50 cameras  Alright  But then  They've increased it  Like 2006  They had another 50  Now they want to 
[01:58:30]  April 2009  Another 50  And now there's  Current legislation  They want to make it  Unlimited cameras  See  It's just a money making  Ploy  Which I would almost  Accept if I knew  Where the fuck  The money was going  Yeah because  And if they would  Stop saying  The city's broke  And I would almost  Accept it  The red light cameras  Through the  Department of Finance  It's not like  You know  A law or nothing  Like that  It's a financial  Ordinance  No Kevin 
[01:59:00]  It is 14 years  93 to 2007  That's 14 years  14 years  Their stats go up  To 2007  So  They've made  They've made  200 million dollars  Up to 2007  Since 93  Yeah  In that 14 year period  So then they've made  From 2007  Now we're in 2011  That's safe to say  At least another  100 million  And that's low balling  I'm sure  That's low balling  I'm sure the money  Is being used  For something  Really good though  Tell me  Tell me what 
[01:59:30]  It's being used  I'm sure it's being  Used for something  Very very good  Kenny thanks  For giving us  More info on that  You're welcome  You guys are having  A terrific show  Today by the way  Oh thank you  Did anybody tell you that  No  No they just like to  Bitch  No matter what we do  They take for granted  How terrific you guys are  Well they certainly do  Yeah  That's how I feel  You know you gotta get up  In the middle of the night  Yeah  To get here  Yeah

[02:01:00]  Increased workload  Increased workload  So Sam had to go  And answer phones today  And there's a couple things  We really want on our show  Today  Yeah  We can't get it done  Because we are  Kind of shorthanded now  Yeah  If we had interns  We wouldn't be shorthanded  So today  The show is absolutely  Being affected  Because we don't have interns  Scott Greenstein  What are you gonna do  About this  Come on  Not dopey Gary  And dopey Rob  We're like  We need interns  That's all we're saying 
[02:01:30]  Oh believe me  I'm on your side  With this one  That's all we're saying  We could just use  Some interns  Because it definitely  Is hurting the show today  We have an example  Of that  Remember that thing  Where I said  The weather guy  Is now the expert  On nuclear power plants  Yeah  We need that audio today  And we can't do that  Because Sam's  Answering some phones  So now  Tomorrow  It's not gonna matter  We wanna play it today  Today

Unless you're with them  Unless you know  They're with us  They could say everything  But actions  Actions speak louder than  Words  Words  Actions are showing  Not totally with us  Actions  Screw actions  Screw meaning well  What the fuck does that mean?  But despite all the adversity 
[02:02:30]  You guys know how to take lemons  And make lemonade  Because you give them  A terrific show regardless  Someone wants me to say  Skill set so bad  But I don't really  I like the praise  Yeah  I like how he's praising  Skill set doesn't really  Fit here  Sorry  So I can't say skill set  For you  Like the skill set  Virginia Tech  Hey Anthony  Fort Wayne  We got an update on  Good old Harry Balls  Thank you  Club Soda Kenny  Harry Balls  Remember Harry Balls

[02:03:30]  Whatever it is  Center  Right  But then they said  No that's kind of silly  Yeah Fort Wayne  Scratches Harry Balls  Scratches Harry Balls  They are really making  The Harry Balls joke  Hey man  Those guys that  Get paid well  To write the headlines  Fort Wayne  Scratches Harry Balls  Out for name  Of government building  Right  See then the rest  Of the fucking sentence  Doesn't make sense  Because they were so excited  They've worked the word  Scratches in there  Scratches Harry Balls

[02:07:30]  Of that building  The people of Fort Wayne  Indiana have spoken  And were  Ignored Anthony  Why?  Because they don't listen  To the people anymore  What year did they stop  Listening to the people  Governments in general  1776  You know what  You know what  That's when they stopped  The second a piece of paper  Was that when  Drawn up  Was that when the  Yeah yeah yeah  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  Yeah we wrote it down  Here are the rules  Here are the rules  The forefathers 
[02:08:00]  Went right with  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  Don't worry about it  Here here here  I love the line  But I think there's some truth  To what you just said  My friend  I think that's when it started  The overwhelming result  Of an online poll  To name a new building  The Harry Balls Government Center  Was thrown out  Because officials thought  It would be ridiculed  Really?  Why?  It's going to be ridiculed  The people said  That's what they want  So how is it now  Being ridiculed  If the majority of the people  Said no  Name it Harry Balls  So don't put it to a vote  Or Bales 
[02:08:30]  It's B-A-A-L-S  It's Balls  That's Balls  Instead they decided  To call the new building  Citizen Square  The real Harry Balls  Who indeed pronounced  His name Balls  Of course  It's right here  Was Fort Wayne's mayor  From 1934 through 47  And again through 51  To 54  His descendants changed  The pronunciation to Bales  Bales  City officials initially said  They would ignore  The results of the poll  Christian Bulls  Yeah  In which 24,000 
[02:09:00]  Of 30,000 voters  Chose Harry Balls  So this is what  The people wanted  And they said  Fuck you  We don't care  What you want  The people want  Harry Balls  The people get  Harry Balls  Don't make a  Fucking maniac  Out of me  The people wanted  Harry Balls  They certainly  Wanted Harry Balls  Because they thought  People would make  Fun of it  So  And who cares  Could have been  Worse  The poll's  Second place choice  Was Thunderdome 
[02:09:30]  Thunderdome  Citizen Square  Only received  Five votes in the poll  They went with  Five  They went with the name  That only five people  Voted for  Five  So keep thinking  That the politicians  Are doing right by you  They represent you  You can't even name a building  Without them getting  Their greasy little hands in it  Harry Balls  Would have been great  Harry Balls would rock  I gotta go to the Balls Center  Right  I'm sure  Yeah  I'm sure  Anytime you have to go  Into that shithole  Of a building  It's for something bad anyway  Yeah  So it should be called

[02:20:30]  You know  Pop figure these days  But they fucking  Left most of his shit  In there  Even though he bombed  Horribly  Now I know a lot of you people  Are here tonight  To watch everyone  Shit on the dumb guy  That all the Italians  Are ashamed of  And disgusted by  You know  Lisa Lampanelli  Backstage she took my hand  And shoved it down her pants  And I pulled out  Larry King's teeth  And Snoop's  Two source awards

Maybe she was caught up  In the moment  No  Look at Larry King  Who are you?  Who is this young  Whippersnapper?  You see how Larry King's head  Is getting giant above  Like a lightbulb  And then really  Really small down below  Lightbulb head  Like uh  His head is looking like

[02:23:00]  I told one of your  Super funny jokes  To a supermodel  And she was laughing  While I was banging her brains out  With a pile of money  On the floor  Of my motherfucking mansion  Oh  Oh  Oh wow  None of the Jersey Shore guys  Have mansions  That was bad  That was  Painfully bad  That one  So I got nothing against you man 
[02:23:30]  I got nothing against you  Because she's like  The fifth model this week  To do that  So  You know what I'm saying right?  Maybe not  Alright  Oh  They're booing him  Now let's get to the real situation  My man Donald Trump  Booing him  I mean  Look at him  He's pimping  Not a lot of guys  Can pull off  Wearing a hat like that  Oh his hair  People are hating on him 
[02:24:00]  Because Trump is always  Fireing people  But  It's kind of okay  Because he'd completely  Let himself go anyway  Donald  Oh wow  What happened?  Nothing  That's just  Hey chill  You know what Donald  You got the tan  You got the laundry  Down  But you gotta hit the gym porch out  But Donald  I like how you roll  I've seen kisses in your house  Everything in your house is gold  Who the f***

Hey  He's lost the crowd  Come on  Let him do his thing  Come on  Let him do it  Look  Read it  Read it  Read it  Alright  Donald Trump  You're a baller  You're a shot caller  You run the game 
[02:25:00]  You give the buildings your name  You're the real deal  And I hope someday  I can roll Trump style  You called him Chump  Not Trump  It's Trump  You said Donald Trump  Really?  Well maybe comedy  At my game right now  But  It's alright  Why don't you finish it up  Can I just show them something?  Can I just show them  Can I just show them?  Show them  You know the situation?  Wash on his belly  That  That definitely is the situation right there  They call me the saturation 
[02:25:30]  Or  You know what?  Actually  Catastrophe  But thanks for letting me here tonight  Well we tried to tag it with  And before I go real quick  I gotta say one more thing  No you don't  Mr. Trump  I think you should vote for president  I probably really mean  That's a stupid idea  Alright  Oh man I heard it was bad  But wow  Wow  Wow  Wow  That is a bombing and a half 
[02:26:00]  And I talked to Joe DeRosa  Because the guys in the comedy community  They're really mad at this  Really?  They're mad because  He doesn't  He's so full of himself  Which we didn't really see much of  When he came in  He was cool to us  To be fair  But he's so full of himself  That he didn't  He doesn't really realize  Or care that he was bombing  And that's what bothers the comics  That's what bothers them  Like that is 
[02:26:30]  That's a bombing  That he should have been  Covered in flop sweat  Cut his set short  And walked away  And not even sat back on the dais  Just leave  And cry  On a shower floor  Yeah  But he's just like  Hey whatever  Right right  And the comics look at that  And go no  No you don't understand  You look like a fool  You bombed  And after you bomb like that  You don't just sit down  And like everything's fine  Wow 
[02:27:00]  Uncomfortable huh  When DeRosa was talking about it  He said it was so uncomfortable to watch  But that is beyond uncomfortable  Yeah absolutely  And some of the jokes  Some of the jokes weren't  At the beginning there  Especially weren't bad  It's his delivery was awful  And then he went on these long winded  Like  I don't know what that was  I  And Snoop  They went to Snoop  Yeah  And he wasn't playing  He was lighting up a joint or something 
[02:27:30]  No I ain't playing with that  What was he lighting up  A blunt  Just decided fuck this  Yeah he said fuck it  I'm bored  He maybe felt like if he was high  It would be funny  Yeah you know  Shit gets funny when you're high  Not that  That would make me paranoid  And wish I wasn't stoned anymore  Why am I here  What's going on  I thought I was at a roast  With comedians  How come no one's laughing  Maybe he's really funny  But I lost like my whole thought  Of what funny is  No it's you  Fuck  You would be convinced 
[02:28:00]  That you're the reason  No one's laughing  They can't concentrate  On situations  Funny comedy  Because they all know I'm high  They all know I'm high  And I'm not funny  And shit  Someone says that  Well let him say it  I'm sorry  Let's go to Frankie in New York  Frankie what's up  Frankie  Hey guys  Hey  What should we call it  At the beginning of the roast  The situation was sitting  Right next to Snoop Dogg  And anytime anybody  Was saying something funny  He was like shoving him  Touching him  You know 
[02:28:30]  Kept touching Snoop  At the end of the roast  He was all the way  At the other end of the dance  At least Lampanelli  Was sitting next to Snoop  Snoop had enough of that  No one wanted to  You don't want  Bomb to rub off on you  Is what happens too  And I can't believe  I shot through  And listened to that  Freaking performance  On the radio  Pretty bad  I'm going to acknowledge  That Charlie wrote this  Unfortunately in Connecticut  And obviously he's angry  Because there's a lot of  A lot of 
[02:29:00]  A lot of capital letters  And exclamation points  Oh yeah  He just writes  DeRosa doesn't have cable  Like we're telling  Some fucking lie here  DeRosa was at the roast  In the audience asshole  Yes  And he said that  You dummy  So he got to see  The whole set  Before they even edited it  Yeah  Because it was probably  Even longer than  What you just heard  And more painful  Let's  Footer  Why are you on hold  Just to listen  What happened to  Your satellite radio  He doesn't have any  He can't hear  Well I'm hanging up on him 
[02:29:30]  Then fuck you  Joe in Tennessee  What's going on  Hey guys  Hey  I was going to watch that roast  But after hearing that  I don't want to now  But  Anyway  I was wondering  How many  2,000 pounds in a car  What kind of car  Is that guy driving  With all them pennies  There's a van  Did we have our math right  A van  I got a one ton truck  And I put one ton in it  It dropped that thing down  Well Danny said  4,000 pounds  4,400 pounds I think  Maybe a van means  Like a box truck  Or something like that  Yeah  That is a good question  How the fuck  Did he get the pennies 
[02:30:00]  To the bank  And both the cost of fuel  He's riding around  Trying to get somebody  To take this money  You're right dude  Totally fake story  Yeah  It's got to be  Fake fake  Totally fake  Alright guys  I'm punching out  Alright brother  Thank you  I think it's real  And the guy tried it  And it didn't work  He could have had a box truck  Like a van  A box truck type of thing  And then someone's  Trying to figure out  Why is he talking black  This situation  Look at all those fake pennies  Oh that's the pennies huh  That's the guy 
[02:30:30]  They're in a bunch of milk crates  Does it say how they  How he got them to the bank  You can see how they  Shopped the same penny  600,000 times  Yes  Fake fake  Totally fake  If you look close  You see they're all 1974 D's  Now that we got the actual story  With the pictures on the screen  The guy did it properly  Look  They're all neat  And they're all wrapped up nice  Even in the nice shrink wrapped ones  Not even the paper  Not the paper wraps  I would have just thrown them all in a box  I wouldn't have wrapped shit up 
[02:31:00]  I don't even dress for the occasion  Look at him  Got a nice tie on  He's got one of those  Like chauffeur type hats on  You helped me put these pennies in my van  Wouldn't you  I don't know  It's from the Daily Mirror though  Or something  Daily Mail  Probably smelled like period  For weeks  Oh the coppery penny  His hands are probably black  From the pennies  His little pennies  He's attracting horny guys  From all over the place  Do they say  Coppery  They don't say what 
[02:31:30]  What the vehicle was  Oh hang on  That's actually why I clicked it  Oh okay  The vehicle  I know because you get caught up in the picture  His vehicle  I need to know  Donna wants to know  Was an MG  No I don't know  Not in this article  Is he English  Is that from England  Well this particular story  No I think this guy was from  From the US of A  He was definitely from the US  Yeah it's California  California was it  Okay  That makes sense  Anthony after the break  Ian Halpern wants to call in badly today 
[02:32:00]  And it's because he's got  And we're not letting him  Well  You actually agreed this time  I was on the fence today  No I know  I agree  We haven't talked to him in a while  I don't care  You said yes  Let's do this  It's like screw it  He's got  I guess he has goddesses too  Like Charlie Sheen  Does he have goddesses  Stop  He should have made this call  About a week ago  Two weeks maybe  Is it up to two weeks ago  Yes  Why is he calling about goddesses today  We could have used them a week  Two weeks ago  He's saying his goddesses  Way hotter than Charlie's 
[02:32:30]  I look at a headline up here  And it says  Risking lives to avert meltdown  Maybe  Maybe you know  That's  More important than goddesses  And Charlie Sheen-isms  And  Yeah  Ian Halperin  It's a gnarly situation over there  Gnarles Gnarlington  Is going on over there  They need Gnarles Gnarlington  Why doesn't he  Tweak that shit  Get real brave  Yeah yeah  Get brave  You wacky guy  He's saying Gnarles Gnarlington  Over there  Come on  He's so crazy  And off the cuff  Why didn't he make any  Japanese jokes  And then we'll be winning 
[02:33:00]  Winning  We're going to throw a fastball  To Japan  Fastball  Gnarles Gnarlington  Is on a flight  Hashtag fastball  Here it comes  In your face people  That's awful  Nah  We'll talk to Ian  Yeah  Alright  He insists that he gets on the show today  So please  Oh well  You remember  We saw one of Ian's  Girlies that he had with him  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah we did  Yeah  We didn't see her in person though  No  She was  She was one that showed up 
[02:33:30]  At his bed in  And she was a little chunky  Oh  She was a disaster  We killed her  We killed her  She was a disaster  We killed her remember  And by the way  That guy took all his pennies  In a delivery van  Oh okay  Oh okay  So I guess whatever  He's the owner of a  Of a dessert company  So he has  I guess access to delivery trucks  And pennies  And pennies  The fuck uses pennies  What do you do when you get pennies  I throw them  I just throw them on the ground  Outside the store  Every single time  If they don't have that dumb penny thing  I do it with nickels and dimes too 
[02:34:00]  Really  I only keep quarters  And I put them in my ashtray  So if I gotta pay a parking meter  Nickels and dimes are worthless  I just figure if I throw them on the ground  In a parking lot  Some kid will pick them up  And enjoy it  Who else do you keep in the ashtray  That's a joke  Let me think  Wow you do it with nickels and dimes  Yeah cause you know why  They end up in your pocket  And then you put your iPhone in there  And it fucks up your iPhone  So I don't like any change whatsoever  Except quarters  Except quarters  I put in my  Alright I'm gonna start doing that now 
[02:34:30]  Cause it's always pennies  I just need to throw  As soon as I leave the store  Or if they have that dumb penny thing  Cause you're never a lot  And if you have a lot of change  There's quarters in there  Which I keep  Right  But you usually only have maybe  Two dimes  Or a dime and a nickel  Or something like that  And a couple of pennies  And you just take them and go  Fling  And then you remember when you were a kid  And you got out of the car  In the parking lot  And you're like  Oh boy look  And you see something shiny  And it's a dime or something  And I also  I hate that these days  I leave a lot of the change behind too  Just as a tip 
[02:35:00]  Even though it's like  I guess people  You're not supposed to tip  Drop kick it  I just  I go look  It's 12 cents here  Just throw it to the cause  It's 37 cents here  Throw it away  Oh we got a guy that knows  How to fix the meltdown  For $10,000  He just needs $10,000  Oh he just needs $10,000  He could fix it  How weird is it  The day before  All that shit went down  We had a guy that was trying  To build his own  Fucking nuclear reaction thing  Some kind of reactor

[02:36:30]  With Snoop Dogg  Right  Yeah  That a family  Was once property  Yeah  It was a no go  Why is that a no go  But the rest of the  Bombs were  I mean  Roasts are supposed  To get really ugly  Yeah  We've been to a few  Of these  They're unbelievable  How ugly they get  Very uncomfortable  I was trying to  Figure out where  They actually cut it out  And I'm thinking  It's probably where  Snoop took out the cigar  And started smoking on stage  Oh yeah  Because that's probably  Was his reaction  To that joke  Yeah  Fuck you  To stay smooth  That's when they  Started showing  All the facial comments 
[02:37:00]  Of everyone in the crowd  But they  Started a new joke  Yeah that's a little  B-roll  So you can edit your shit  Alright guys  Thanks for punching out  All us filmmakers  Do that  The B-roll  I could make a whole feature  With this stock footage  Right  Kingston Pete writes  On Twitter  Lisa Lampanelli  Had the best line  Of the roast  And this is a pretty good line  Yeah  Trump builds more  Useless hotels  Than an autistic kid  Playing Monopoly  Okay  That's pretty good  They kept that in 
[02:37:30]  Right  That's pretty good  But the slavery joke  Is a no go  Alright Ian Halper next  Sirius XM  The virus  This  Is the O.B. Anthony Show  The O.B. and Anthony Show  Coming up  Shuttle situation  I don't know  What that's about  Ah it's probably  You know  Always takes them forever  To get that thing going  Why are we still  There's only like  Two more left  I think  Two more launches  Why are they still  Using the parachute  I gotta slow that bitch down 
[02:38:00]  I understood in the 80s  But they couldn't figure out  Another way to slow that shit down  I think something cool  Like rockets on the front  I don't know  Something  Something cool  And modern  That parachute  Shit's like  Leonardo da Vinci  And shit  Yeah  That's old school  Holla  There's only two more  Shuttle launches  Left  I'm pretty sure  That's it  And that's it  And then  Yeah  Then they  Then we're at the mercy  Of the fucking Russians  Or something  To get into space  I don't know  It's just  It sucks 
[02:38:30]  Does that make sense to you  No  It's fucking depressing  It doesn't make sense  During my  My entire life  I remember  The United States  Being like  At the forefront  Of the space program  Right  You know  Fucking  Just being able  To do a thing  Get her done  Kind of a thing  Get her done  Where are we going  I'm really good  At dumb questions  And here's today's  Dumb question  So  We are not doing  The NASA thing anymore  Right  Well it's still NASA  But it's like  Not  I mean  But we're 
[02:39:00]  We don't have  A working spacecraft  Right  Okay  So we don't have  A working spacecraft  But Russia will  Yeah  So they're in  Better shape  Than us  To keep their program  Going  But we can't  Keep our program  Going  That's because  They've been using  The same shit  Spacecraft  For years  So why don't we  Just continue  Using the same shit  With some modifications  Yeah  Well we  We could use  Something like  You know  A capsule again  And a  A rocket  With a capsule on it  But we kind of  Liked the shuttle  That was working 
[02:39:30]  Do you think  Do you think  Those guys were scared  Every time  I bet  Every time  Yeah  There's not a human  Alive that  Would not feel  Just pure  Fear  How you can sit  On top of  The biggest  All that power  Bomb  Right  Just wonder  Like hmm  Is today  Going to be  The day  It had to be  Scared shitless  Explodes  Yeah  But now  No shuttle  No real way  To get into  A man  Into space 
[02:40:00]  You know  We could send  Satellites up  And shit  But  You know  It sucks  That if  People want to  Go to the  Space station  Which we  Pretty much  Fucking  Brought everything  Up there  To build  We gotta  Hitch a ride  With the Russians  Man if  If JFK  Was alive  Today  Oh he would  Be  Ah my  Head  Look at it  And it hurts  It's all  Peeled back  That's what he  Would be  Saying  It's benign  Hole in the  Head  That's exactly

And she's hanging out with one of the world's best pole smokers.  I mean, they're smoking hot, man.  You know, these are the...  And you.  Where's the picture of you and her and Geraldo, Ian?  Fake boobs, fake boobs.  See, look, she keeps coming back on the phone.  She's so mad.  You're so mad.  We got you.  We fucking destroyed your soul. 
[03:09:00]  She's really anguished.  She's so upset.  Ian.  I know.  It's because you're so mean to her.  Well, she said she could play.  We decided to play.  Come on.  Did we not warn her that we would get to her soul?  Oh, well, I know you can try and get...  No, we got her bad.  I know.  Because she knows she's pretty much useless.  But I know.  Hey, where's the picture of you, Geraldo, and Ian Halperin?  Have you not found it yet?  Because no one's telling us where to go.  Oh, right.  That left me wide open, but I'm not going to rise to it. 
[03:09:30]  No.  Well, if you're hot, then you should have nothing to hide.  Well, no, I haven't got anything to hide.  It's not a problem.  I'm quietly confident.  All right, then let's see the picture.  Ian, they want to see this picture of you and I and Geraldo.  He'll email it to you, but it's not my wonderful friend.  It's just me and Ian and...  It's not on his website? 
[03:10:00]  I think it was on his website.  Have a little look.  Can he post it on his Twitter account?  Yeah.  Twitter?  Twitter.  You guys love a bit of Twitter, don't you?  Yes.  Yeah, we like Twitter.  She sounds like an actress.  Oh, really?  What's your email address?  Well, it's an English accent.  So that we can...  Oh, I think we're going to send some pictures of last night.  Golly.  What's your email address, sweetheart?  If we give it out, then we're going to get 10,000 emails and we're never going to be able 
[03:10:30]  to find your picture.  Oh, really, Freddie?  She sounds like from the Prestige.  You sound like the wife from the Prestige.  Can you tell me that you love me?  I just want to know if it's true today.  I love you.  No, that's not you.  That's not you.  Not today.  How can I love you, Freddie?  Not today.  It's ridiculous.  Not today, no.  You'll love anyone.  Not today, no.  You'll love anyone for the right price, right?  I wish this call would end, like, her life. 
[03:11:00]  No, I wouldn't let anybody...  Like the marriage ended.  Or swinging from a beam.  Hey.  Boys are a little too...  Hold on a minute.  I don't think you have enough...  Hold on.  I got something.  Are you guys at a Best Western?  Best Western?  No, we're in the set.  There's no set.  Dave, what's up?  From South Beach.  Hey, this is Dave.  Hey, I'm the night manager here at the Best Western, and these three have been carrying  on all night long. 
[03:11:30]  What a night manager at the Best Western.  You're at a Best Western in South Beach.  Dave, we've made at least five trips to the ice machine.  Are you serious, Dave?  Are you just trying to...  Oh, he's...  I hope he's serious.  I believe him.  I believe him, too.  Are you at a Best Western, ma'am?  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  Nay.  You girls talk funny.  That's not the worst English accent I've had.  I don't think I sound like Bora. 
[03:12:00]  No, actually, English accents are pretty fucking hot on girls, I've got to be honest.  Yeah, we should have got along with you, but...  I know.  ...we got frustrated because you wouldn't answer any questions, so...  Well, I'm talking to you.  What would you like to know?  Well, I don't know.  We want to see a picture of you.  We want to see if you would lez out a little bit.  But where's his brother?  His brother?  What?  Ah, come on, I'm just quoting lines from a movie, don't worry about it.  Which movie?  I love quoting lines from movies.  Do you like The Prestige?  No, I don't know what that is.  I'll see. 
[03:12:30]  What movie do you like?  Yeah, what movies do you like?  Oh, The Tankerman.  What?  Do you like Your Highnesses movies?  Oh, those things?  I don't know, I haven't seen one yet.  If you know, you should get your eyes around it.  Get my eyes around it.  I don't do straight-to-DVD movies, sorry.  Me glazies.  I don't know about this one, though.  Yeah?  Oh, dear.  I think we, um...  You need a good...  I think you need a good tooling. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We still need a little email address, boys, because we've got the pictures all ready to send.  Okay, I'll tell you what.  Sweetheart, shush.  Shut up.  Okay.  Send it to...  Now, listen very closely.  I know it's difficult for you guys.  Yeah.  You want me to do this off-air real fast?  Nay.  Nah, we can get it done.  All right, go.  You ready?  Yeah.  Opie?  You got that?  Opie?  She's not going to know any of this.  Okay.  Anthony at...  And I'll spell this for you because you're retarded. 
[03:13:30]  S-I-R-I-U-S-X-M dot com.  That ain't happening.  I'm not retarded.  How dare you?  All right, what did he say?  What did he just say?  What did he just say?  Yeah.  Please read that back.  And if you get it perfectly, we will not be mean anymore.  I know who you're hanging out with.  You're retarded.  Anthony at Sirius at something.  Yeah, so you got it wrong.  Anthony at Sirius at something.  At Sirius something.  Are you serious?  At Sirius at something dot com. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, my God.  That's such a fucking bad idea.  That's my job.  That's my job.  Yeah.  All right.  Is the other girl still really mad?  Yeah, she's just quietly brewing in the corner.  Quietly brewing.  Let's get her back on the phone.  I think we can smooth things over.  I really do.  Would you like to smooth things over, my wonderful, lovely, beautiful friend?  Yes, yes, yes.  Please.  Okay, right.  But listen, I'm only going to put you on if you are actually nice to her.  Yeah, we'll be nice. 
[03:14:30]  Absolutely.  Can you apologize for talking about all the raping and pillaging and murdering and horrific  We can be gentlemen.  We'll apologize.  We can be gentlemen.  You can, you?  Yes, we can.  Okay, right.  Well, I'm going to hold you to the smell, please.  Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.  See?  She's still stealing.  Yes.  We did warn her.  We said we would destroy her soul.  I hope she holds her breath and dies.  Oh.  Are you back?  Possibly. 
[03:15:00]  Are you all right now?  Hello.  What comment got you?  The rape thing?  No, not even that.  I suppose it was just a...  No, there was one word before it that he used.  I mean, I can't even remember what it was.  Bitch, twat, cunt.  No, no.  It was a little bit more on the deeper level of being, like, retired.  I can't remember what it was.  It'll come to me later, maybe.  Mongoloid?  And I thought that was bad.  And then he hit me with the rape and murdered.  And I just thought, oh, my golly gosh, I've never heard such, like... 
[03:15:30]  Oh, my golly gosh.  Golly gosh, yeah.  You never want a golly gosh.  How old a bird are you?  Sorry?  A bird?  Oh, I love it.  They know a few...  Yeah, you're right.  They do know a few English word things.  How old are you?  I'm 26.  And I'm not lying, either.  I'm fascinated with the English.  Can we see a picture of you?  We could turn this around if we see a nice picture of you.  Yeah.  I know we can.  Well...  I have an open mind here.  We need to see a picture of you.  Where do we go?  As you're probably going to be horrible anyway. 
[03:16:00]  No, no, no.  It'd be better to send, like, a minging photo of myself.  And then, like, kind of upgrade myself and send an all right photo.  How about one picture?  Where do we go to see you?  Well, they ripped me to pieces.  And no more space magic.  We don't want any Facebook magic.  What does that mean?  See?  That means you're hot.  All right.  Where can we...  Did you talk about midgets?  I've got a thing about midgets.  I always...  My midget...  This is so funny. 
[03:16:30]  Anybody else?  I know.  I'd rather have my teeth pulled.  Wait, listen.  Can I ask?  What aren't I allowed to say on here?  You could say anything.  Yeah.  You're just not allowed to wish...  You know, rape on somebody.  Yeah.  You could say anything, though.  Yeah.  Good question.  Listening to the conversation already and why I got the unparlier.  Definitely can say anything.  Can we see a picture of you, please?  I watched midget porn for the first time about three weeks ago.  How'd you like it?  It was very weird.  Did you like it?  Did it get you, like, hot? 
[03:17:00]  Were you...  You know what was funny?  Was when I was asked about it, I was asked, did he have a big dick?  And I was like, the man was normal size.  So he had a normal size dick on a midget body.  No, no, no.  I mean, it was a normal size man.  Oh.  And a midget woman.  It wasn't...  Oh, a midget woman.  And I just find it funny that that person thought that.  That's all.  Oh.  Did she have a regular size vagina?  Did it fit the penis fit?  I suppose so.  I suppose... 
[03:17:30]  Weird, if you think about it.  Yeah.  This is weird.  Yeah, I suppose.  I mean, mine's a little and her's a little, so yeah, I think it looked normal.  Do you girls in England shave your vaginas?  Do we shave?  No, yeah.  Girls shave, wax, immac.  I don't like girls that take it all off.  I think it's a little bit weird.  It kind of makes guys into kind of little girls, you know?  Right.  Yeah.  You shouldn't do that.  That's a bit of a naughty one.  I don't like it when they do that on porn videos.  They take it...  I know.  I like a little bit down there.  Just a little bit. 
[03:18:00]  She's turning...  You're turning the listeners around.  Just Brian from Providence writes,  I want to mouthfuck English chick number two.  I bet it's just because you've stopped...  I bet it's just because you've stopped wearing these so bloody awful.  I'm listening.  I want to mouthfuck.  That's turning them around.  You're turning around the audience, Sam.  Yes.  Bing.  Bing.  Bing.  Yay.  You've got mail.  Look what time it is.  Yeah, I know.  It's 10 o'clock.  I know.  How did that happen?  We might have to do 20 extra minutes for the listeners tomorrow.  I apologize.  Can you say...  We can't even spin this one. 
[03:18:30]  What?  Can you say what?  Can you say vitamin water for me, please?  Vitamin water.  Vitamin water.  No, I want to hear you say it in your American accent.  Oh, like vitamin water?  Yeah, but can you really go all out and really make it sound really cheesy, dirty American  for me?  Oh, vitamin water?  Vitamin water.  Fucking vitamin water, you fucking cunt.  See, you don't mind that word over there.  Okay, then say aluminium. 
[03:19:00]  Let me hear you say aluminium.  What for you, my office?  We're working, we're talking.  Say aluminium.  Aluminium foil.  It's aluminium, you silly.  Listen, you know what?  Just for the record, it's not the garbage, it's the rubbish.  It's not the trash can, it's the bin.  The bin.  It's not an open...  No, it's not an...  It's not an elevator, it's a lift.  It's not a room, it's a flat.  So you're rubbish and belong in the garbage.  Yeah.  So you're rubbish and you should be taken to the bin. 
[03:19:30]  Correct.  After you've been raped.  Oh, God.  I don't mind them now, they make me smile a little bit more because they're funnier.  You're much funnier when you're not horrible and swearing, do you know?  Yes.  Exactly, exactly.  You know what?  You probably are making a good point right now.  You're probably making a good point.  She is.  We are lovable.  God, we know we're lovable.  We're lovable ass.  We just don't like to show that side.  Okay.  Golly gee.  You got us.  Hey, can we see a picture of you?  I want to see a picture.  We want to see pictures of you before you lezz out for everyone. 
[03:20:00]  Lezz out is the most immature thing I've ever heard anyone say.  Lezz out.  Who's lezzing out?  Ian, we got to wrap this show up.  All right.  This was great.  I want to say hi to all the fans out there.  Did you get the pics?  Just let's say in there.  Did you really hear the email address?  Did you get the pics?  Did you hear the email address we gave out?  How were you supposed to get the pics?  Where did you send them to, Ian? 
[03:20:30]  Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  That isn't it.  Oh, my God.  That's so not it.  It was Opie Anthony.  Okay.  Hold on.  Opie Anthony.  You'll get it in 30 seconds.  I just want you to...  Not with our servers.  No, and then you have to do the SiriusXM.com.  You know that part, right?  All right.  Opie Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  Dude, I'm a number one New York Times bestselling author. 
[03:21:00]  I think I know how to spell by now.  But...  I will fuck you up.  Yeah, there you go.  Here, it's going to be there in 30 seconds.  It's all loading.  You know, I just want to...  Google that one.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  I hear you.  We like your goddesses.  I think we turned it around with them.  Yeah, yeah.  I was kind of digging them.  We learned as long as you don't talk about raping them, they're kind of nice.  Yeah.  You know... 
[03:21:30]  I'm an aversion to the rape thing, though.  They don't really like it.  I understand.  Can I bring them in the studio?  Only if they lezz out.  Once we see the pictures, and if they lezz out...  We have a lezz out rule with these two.  They're not welcome unless they lezz out.  One of them wore a hot bra, right?  Now, where did you get that, bro?  I hope you mean on fire.  You hear him go, where did you get that bra?  Because he wants one for himself.  Where did you get that?  Where did I buy it?  I've never heard a guy go, where did you get that?  You just go, wow, that's fucking hot.  I'm shopping this morning. 
[03:22:00]  Shopping.  You send me Anthony's credit card number?  Of course.  You know, for all the time, at least you guys could foot the bill.  Did you blow through all that governator money?  You know what, it's...  The meetings have gone through the roof.  You know what, Ant?  It's official.  Yeah.  I'm going to credit the audience 20 minutes of listening.  Yeah, they should be refunded a few minutes.  We're going to credit the listeners 20 minutes.  Actually, we have to make it a half hour.  We're giving the listeners a half hour credit.  We owe you a half hour radio.  Yes, we apologize. 
[03:22:30]  Thanks to Ian Halperin.  Hey, we're looking at our email, Ian, and we don't see no pictures coming.  I do.  I sent it.  You know, why isn't it there?  Why isn't it there?  I am here.  Do you have a more simple email address?  You said you knew how to spell, remember?  God, he had a great secret weapon, too.  I know.  They would have saved his ass.  Norton?  They would have saved his bill.  Norton is away for now.  Yeah.  He's gigging somewhere. 
[03:23:00]  Cancer treatment.  Oh, God.  I want to bring the goddesses in.  Yeah, we'd love that.  Do that.  Do that.  Yeah, we'd love that.  And the cameras, because this new movie, His Highness and His Goddesses, it's going to be fantastic.  Did you receive it?  What's wrong with Gmail this morning?  I don't know.  I don't know, Ian.  We're not getting the pictures of the goddesses.  That's saying it, Ian.  Where could it, here?  Let me just post it on my website.  The pictures have arrived.  Oh, they have?  Oh, okay.  What's the problem? 
[03:23:30]  Is that they're being forwarded to me, and this, you know, when different servers need  to talk to each other.  Yeah.  You know, sometimes it takes long.  Who has them?  Well, they're sent.  It's the XM server trying to get it out to my email.  Oh, okay.  So, hang on.  All right.  We might have the pictures here, Ian.  It'll be here.  It's just coming.  Yes.  I want to see if the goddesses are in apology or not.  Well, they're smoking.  No matter how they look, it doesn't make them any less obnoxious. 
[03:24:00]  That's true.  Got to agree with you there.  Let's not be too cheeky here.  I mean, they are.  Oh, he gets a little nervous.  Yeah, let's not be too cheeky.  No, dude.  Really, I challenge you to tell me that anyone has better calls.  He feels like he got the best for his $200.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that it?  All right, let's see.  Oh, that one's definitely English. 
[03:24:30]  Which goddess do you prefer?  They're both smoking.  The one without the horsey teeth?  Yeah, there's one with horsey teeth.  Oh, boy.  I guarantee that's the one that really is mad at us.  And what's on her knee?  Yeah, what is that?  She's got like...  It's like antifungal.  Oh, antifungal?  She's got MRSA or something on her knee.  What's that?  It's all white on her knee.  She's got into neck.  She's got nice legs, Ian.  But...  Hold on. 
[03:25:00]  Here's one of the goddesses.  All right.  All right.  Hello.  Hello, boys.  Hi.  Are you the one in the red dress or the blonde?  I'm the blonde.  Okay, you got horse teeth.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  I like horses.  That's cool.  Oh, boy.  The teeth are a little big.  We could be honest with each other, right?  Oh, why?  And you look a little thick around the midsection.  Oh, boy.  Oh, really?  A little bit.  A little thick around the midsection.  And you might need breast implants at this point in your life.  Oh, really?  You think so?  Golly. 
[03:25:30]  I think so.  Yeah, there's like tit fat on the side.  Tit fat?  Are you seeing tit fat?  A little bit.  Tit fat on the side.  You see that, Danny?  I don't know what you call that.  Yeah, there's like a, like it's, it's, yeah, it's like, it's like a, yeah, it's like you're  baking a muffin and it's almost like you've got to start a back tits.  No, I think she's wearing a bra that's way too small for her to try and mush more tits  into the front.  Oh, I see.  Oh, right.  I've seen that.  I've seen that.  Let me see the rest of her, though.  Let's, let's be fair here.  Your eyes are nice. 
[03:26:00]  Your knee, what's on your knee?  Is that MRSA?  Um, I'll tell you what that is.  I went out in Cardiff and got really drunk and fell over and it's just some crazy.  And if you're into feet, she's got the, she's got nice feet.  Oh, thank you.  I'm not, I'm not into feet, but I know the feet guys are out there wondering.  So, so what are, where, what are you guys doing in that picture?  You're just chilling?  And in all fairness, wait, you're the one that's not pissed off, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  You're, you're way better looking than the one that's really pissed off. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, shit.  Say that.  Dude, she's stunning, man.  Stunning, man.  Which one?  Both.  You got it.  His Highness.  Stunning.  Nah, the brunette's, uh, she's, she's got horrible fucking, like, uh, thinning hair.  Oh, God damn.  Now here they are, they're all made up and they all got their makeup on and dresses.  Which one would you do?  Go ahead, Danny.  Nah, I'm just, like, they look, they're passable in this picture, but think about what they 
[03:27:00]  look like when, like, you just wake up and then it's just like, right, right, they're  all gussied up.  And then you roll over to the one in the red dress.  With that, when she's all, all no made up and she's drinking the night before.  Ian, this is your, Ian, this is your problem.  Give me the full shot again.  And I'm going to be honest with you, Ian.  The two girls are, I want you to be honest.  The two girls are nice, but as far as South Beach goes, you got a bunch of pigs.  You know that, right?  Because, I mean, the grading, the only pig in South Beach is LeBron. 
[03:27:30]  No, the grading scale in Miami is much different, okay?  These girls would be maybe a seven, six and a half, seven in New York.  But in Miami, South Beach, they're about a three, let's be honest, right?  Now, go to the full shot, Danny.  First of all, these chicks don't have any Adam's apples.  Most of the chicks...  I hear you.  All right, listen.  Here it is.  You don't know what you're getting.  Here it is.  If you put the two girls together...  Hold on, let me finish.  Let His Highness finish here.  Second, they have intellect up the walls.  Why try to make something out of this fucking mud pile? 
[03:28:00]  They're extremely sensual, and they're...  All right, you talk.  They're for it.  It gives the exotic flavor.  Have you ever banged a British broad, either of you?  What I would have said, Ant?  Yeah.  Is, see, the blonde's legs are nice.  Yeah.  Except for the scab, okay?  Right, right.  The girl in the red dress has thick fucking Hillary Clinton-type legs, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you take the blonde's legs, but the red dress girl has a fine ass.  You can see that, right? 
[03:28:30]  I don't know if I can see.  And the blonde girl is a little thick around the midsection.  So I would take the red dress's ass.  Is that just an anomaly in the dress?  And then I would move on to the blonde's face, but I would remove her teeth and replace it with the red dress's teeth.  Yeah.  And then you're looking at a pretty good-looking broad.  I'm going to tell you about my bum.  Oh, hi.  Do you have a nice ass?  It looks like you have a nice ass.  You're the one in the red dress, right?  Hold up, hold up.  Did you send a picture of me?  Yeah, we did.  Got it.  Yeah, we see a picture. 
[03:29:00]  Are you kidding?  What a shitty hotel room, too, by the way.  Yeah, that is a shitty room.  Whose shitty room is this?  Your mom's room.  When you're talking about your bum, are you talking about Ian?  Oh, hilarious.  Because it's a bad room.  Whose apartment is this?  In South Beach.  I don't know.  What picture are you looking at?  The three of you.  You're all looking at a camera.  Oh, obviously.  God. 
[03:29:30]  Wow.  Your voice is much hotter than your picture.  Just saying.  Do you know what's the matter?  But you do have a nice ass.  But you're like, your calves are a little thick.  What's going on there?  Yeah, what's going on?  My calves are a little thick.  They're a bit thick.  And your face is very plain looking.  And your hair is kind of thinning.  Like you might be going through chemo or something.  Oh, okay.  So, okay.  I understand.  You don't have a photo in front of you.  And you're pretending to have one for your listeners.  Lame.  Okay, cool.  Whatever.  Lying.  Okay.  She's so mad again. 
[03:30:00]  I'm looking at you.  She's playing that game.  Okay.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  But you're definitely a goer.  Because, you know, you're not getting a lot of opportunities out there.  So, you probably give up the ass after just having a cup of coffee.  You're not good looking enough to have morals.  So, you got that going for you.  Yeah, that's good.  Look how vicious. 
[03:30:30]  You know I get off on this?  I'm pretty much getting a hard on because I know I got to you.  She is a little angry.  A little angry.  It's funny.  All right.  Look, you know, I mean, I would get something.  I don't know.  I think.  Maybe I would add some hair.  That would help.  I think we got off on the wrong foot.  Picking up the hair.  Make sure you're always wearing pants because the calves are a little rough.  I'm not lying to you.  But the ass is nice.  You get a nice pair of jeans going.  I thought, you know what?  I do hate girls that always say.  I do hate girls that always say, oh, I'm a model. 
[03:31:00]  And I think, okay, you're stupid, not stupid, but you don't really do much.  I don't need a model.  I just need a girl that I can certainly walk outside with and be a little proud of.  I get put forward for castings for my legs.  It's the only thing I do get put forward for castings for.  So I know you're not looking for it.  And you're giving the P sign the picture, which means you're very uncomfortable in your  own skin.  Is that what that means?  Oh, yeah, it is.  Oh, that's a shame.  All right.  I think we got off on the wrong foot again.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:31:30]  That's what happened.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  There's one of you that bounced.  Okay.  So you two are like a little tag team.  One of you that's nice.  One of you that's horrible.  The one that's nice.  Yeah, that's me.  Can you pipe up a little bit?  Excuse me, excuse me.  The nice one.  Can you pipe up?  Because it always, you know, like when you go, like I've just been in Dubai recently.  You know, when you haggle with something, one of you's got to play good cop, bad cop.  Can I speak to good cop for five minutes?  Because obviously you get overpowered by bad cop, but I reckon you're much better to talk  to.  You know what?  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  You know what?  Hold on.  Hold on.  You called this out on that and you're absolutely correct. 
[03:32:00]  Hold on.  If you listen for a second, you're going to get what you want.  You're going to get what you want.  Listen, I am the bad cop.  I'm going to now give you my friend, Anthony, who is certainly the good cop in this situation.  Okay?  I saw the picture.  I'm out.  See?  I saw the picture.  You girls look lovely in the picture, by the way.  I'm the bad one, right?  Your picture.  I don't want to speak to that one.  You're...  Come back, go B.  Oh, there you go.  She wants bad cop.  You want to talk to the bad guy?  She wants bad cop.  I'm the bad guy.  I'm the bad guy. 
[03:32:30]  I'm the bad guy.  Do you know what?  I actually drove through that neighborhood today.  What?  I drove through that neighborhood today like a complete...  I didn't know there were trains in South Beach.  Wait, what were you saying?  You're waking...  You're waking up...  Is that a train? 
[03:33:00]  End of story.  aye  aye  you darn tootin  alright look I think we gave you about  10 minutes back so  let's do this  let's make a deal with each other we owe the listeners
