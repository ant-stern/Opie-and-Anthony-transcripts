<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with E-Rock filling in for Sam Roberts.  A wheel-spinning segment, devised with input from Ron Bennington, determined the temporary host: Mars.  Mars took over hosting duties, playing pre-recorded bits from Opie and Anthony and fielding listener calls.

The pre-recorded bits included Opie receiving a bike ticket, and Anthony recounting childhood spankings and encounters with adults he perceived as potentially predatory, including a Mexican man and a Native American woman, along with experiences at a California ranch,  detailing his father's disciplinary methods and further encounters with potentially predatory adults. Another bit featured Jimmy Jackson, a man who ran a horse stable and was involved in various scams.

Mars also discussed a UFC fight, focusing on a fighter's surprising knockout. The listener calls were varied and often raunchy.  Callers complimented Mars, requested his phone number, discussed Puerto Rican culture, made accusations of child molestation within the Latino community and referenced homosexuality, shouted out motorcycle clubs, and made sexually suggestive comments towards Mars. One caller mistakenly identified Mars as "The Situation" from the Jersey Shore.

Following this segment, the show transitioned into a discussion of the Spanish words "puta" and "puto," exploring their varying meanings and connotations depending on context and regional slang.  The hosts also discussed their perceptions of different Hispanic groups and their working habits in New York City, particularly contrasting Central Americans' work ethic with others.  This conversation devolved into jokes and non sequiturs, concluding with a prolonged repetition of the sound "Oos."

The broadcast ended with a call from Ron Bennington, who offered enthusiastic praise for Mars's hosting performance and speculated on the show's success.  No guests were in studio besides Mars and E-Rock, although Ron Bennington was mentioned throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Well, it looks like Sam's not here today.  I think he's got something with his stomach or something like that.  But I'm taking over. I'm E-Rock. It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Opie and Anthony and Jim are all gone.  And it just sucks that Sam's not here because today is a big day. 
[00:00:30]  This is something that Opie and Ron Bennington came up with.  They wanted to do spin the wheel to see who was going to host this week after Opie and Anthony Live.  Now, I'm not on this list of people who have been selected to host the show.  I'm just going to help out.  But some of the names that we have are like Travis, Danny, D-Boy, Troy, Mars is on it.  Rob Cross, who's one of the cute bosses, as Opie and Anthony call it.  He's on the list and a few others.  So, I guess we'll just spin this wheel here and see who it comes up with. 
[00:01:00]  This is a long wheel.  And it's Troy.  No, it's Mars.  Mars, come in here.  Mars.  Where is Mars?  There he is.  He's coming up to the studio. 
[00:01:30]  Yo, yo, yo.  What's up, man?  I should have rigged, man.  I am the first person.  Come on.  Well, that's what the wheel landed on.  It was almost Troy, but now it's you.  All right.  Hi, people.  How are you doing out there?  Man, is Opie death?  His headphones are extremely loud.  Yeah, he does keep that a bit loud.  So, I guess, people, I'm supposed to go ahead and play some bits that...  Well, you can do whatever you want.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live, hosted by Mars today.  You can talk about the show. 
[00:02:00]  You can talk about what's going on with you.  We can play some material.  Why don't you give out the phone number so people can call you?  That is 866-969-1969.  That's 866-969-1969.  If you guys want to give me a call, give me some topics to talk about, or ask me any questions,  or tell me how great I'm doing.  Well, you could give some topics out, too, to discuss with the listeners.  Absolutely.  What do you got?  Over the weekend.  I know you guys know that I'm into the MMA stuff. 
[00:02:30]  Over the weekend, yesterday, as a matter of fact, we had a pretty interesting fight for the UFC.  It was Ultimate Fighter 4, I believe it was.  What was so interesting about it was the...  First of all, the main event didn't become so because there was a medical suspension for the fighter that was on the main event, Marquette.  So they moved the main event...  The second fight that was supposed to be before the main event, they moved that up as the main event.  That was Chet Congo and Pat Berry. 
[00:03:00]  And what was so interesting about that fight was that Chet Congo, man, he was getting...  He got floored twice.  It was out of there.  But the ref was a good ref.  He paid attention.  Saw that he was still fighting back.  And at the last second, the last hooray, he throws a right hook and knocks Pat Berry out.  So when this guy...  But the thing is also, when this guy gets knocked out, his eyes stay open.  They look...  He looks so freaky. 
[00:03:30]  That was kind of fun.  So, but how does that segue into my next bit that I want to play for ONA?  I don't know.  I'll see what we have here.  The phones are blowing up.  I want to go to one of them.  I see.  Is anybody screening the phones?  Nope.  It's just going blind.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  All right, caller.  Call, you there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's up?  How you doing?  How are you?  How you doing, buddy?  Good.  I wanted to know, where are you from in Puerto Rico?  What part of the island?  Actually, I'm not from the island. 
[00:04:00]  I'm from Manhattan.  Okay.  I'm a New York Rican.  Is your family from there?  I'm sorry?  Is your family from there?  No.  They're from Puerto Rico.  Oh, well.  I love Puerto Rico.  It's all islands.  Kind of fun.  Yeah.  They're from...  My mother's from Ponce.  My father's from Nahuatl, I believe.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's all I got.  All right.  Thank you very much.  You bet.  Next caller.  Hey, caller.  How you doing?  Hello?  Hey, hi.  Hi.  Why do you have an accent if you're not from Puerto Rico? 
[00:04:30]  I guess because New York Ricans have accents.  Nigger speak, nigger speak, nigger speak, nigger speak.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  What is that supposed to do?  Throw you off.  Really?  Great.  Let me try one more call and then we'll talk about some bits that I'm going to play here.  Caller, you're on the air.  How can I help you?  Hi.  I think Mr. Malonegan should host the show.  Thank you.  Sure thing.  No problem.  You got his name up there, Eric?  We'll add him to the list.  There you go.  Hey, Eric, there's this bit here about Opie gets tickets while riding his bike. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  What's that about?  Um, it's from, well, it's from this day in history.  In 2007, it happened on this day.  Uh, Opie was, uh, talking about how he likes to go bike riding up and down, uh, the west  side of Manhattan.  And he was at, uh, one of the areas that has the piers there.  And he started to go off the path and ride on the piers.  And one of those, uh, wannabe cops, the ticket people.  Right.  Uh, decided to block him and give him a ticket for riding on the pier. 
[00:05:30]  Cool.  We're going to play that next.  But, uh, first, uh, um, Ron and Fez interns.  Where the fuck are my headphones?  I got three headphones missing in this room.  Turn the mics on.  Let's hear them.  Come on.  Let's let, you got any excuses for me?  Uh, go to, uh, Jim's mic.  Jim's.  You got Jim's mic.  You're on Jim's mic right there.  You have three headphones missing, you said?  Yes.  They always, uh, live behind the, uh, TVs back there.  And when I came in today and there were, uh, there were quite a few missing, but I found 
[00:06:00]  one in your bin.  Do you guys know, uh, where the others are?  No idea.  All right.  No idea.  I have no idea.  The ones that say studio 11, please leave them here.  If you find them, please leave them here.  Cause that's for the guests and anybody else that needs a pair of headphones.  Yeah.  We have three for them that we keep in the bin.  Three.  You should have two.  Or two.  I don't know.  Was there one extra?  We might've been.  Is there two?  Okay.  We have two then.  Okay.  Yeah.  So don't take any more than two, please.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  No problem.  All right.  The phones are blowing up again.  Blowing up again.  All right.  Do you want me to go to the phones? 
[00:06:30]  Sure.  If you want.  Call her.  How can I help you?  Hey Mars.  I really want to have sex with you.  God damn.  You're fucking hot.  You know, that's.  You know.  Take it for me.  Send me some pictures.  Thank you very much.  That's very.  Man.  That's cool, man.  Anybody else with some compliments like that?  I wrote his number down for him.  Okay.  Cool.  Call her.  You're on the line.  You're on the air.  Yes.  Hey Mars.  Sir.  How you doing, buddy?  How you doing?  Good.  Good.  First, I want to ask you.  When are you going to jump the shit out of Sam Roberts? 
[00:07:00]  Number one.  And number two.  How far are you going with your career in the MMA?  All right.  Number one with Sam.  You know, I love Sam.  We all love Sam.  He is a ball buster.  He does get on people's nerves.  I know.  I'm not the only one that feels that way.  I'm just the only one that would speak up.  But he's a cool guy overall.  You know, no need to choke him out because it would be an abuse.  I'm only kidding.  No, I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know you guys fuck around. 
[00:07:30]  I mean, you know, the other day I thought you were going to choke the shit out of him  when he started talking about Puerto Rican relatives touching their, you know.  Their kids.  Their nieces and nephews.  And then, of course, you got put right in the middle of that shit.  Right.  No, no.  It's all fun and it's fun, but sometimes, you know, we have to admit, sometimes it does  get a little out of hand and you do want to pop somebody in the head, but you can't  do that.  So that'll never happen.  Yeah.  What, I know you talk about the MMA. 
[00:08:00]  Are you going to eventually try to get into some series like UFC or?  No, unfortunately, I'm too old.  I'm 46.  I started too late.  You're 46?  Yes.  No shit, 46.  The sound of your voice is always taking you for, you know, late 20s, early 30s.  Oh, and you should look at me.  I look like 20.  No shit.  Yeah, man.  Good for you.  Good for you.  But honestly, I started a little too late.  I just like doing it.  It's good exercise.  Keeps me in shape. 
[00:08:30]  Don't believe what Jim tells you about me being so fat.  I got a little bit of fat, but it keeps me in shape and I like to teach kids as well.  Yeah, just one more thing.  When I was in the Marine Corps, I was on the USS Ponce.  Yeah.  And I was in Ponce, Puerto Rico, shit, 35 years ago.  It was a beautiful town.  Really?  You like it?  Good.  Beautiful town.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you think about the girls?  Huh?  What do you think about the girls?  Well, it's funny because that was the home port for the ship. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  It was originally christened.  They had a big ball on this Navy ship, the USS Ponce.  We had to dress up in our tress blues and the guys in their Navy whites.  And we escorted all the single females in town that were in gowns.  Nice.  It was a big ball.  Oh, man.  They were drop-dead gorgeous.  Nice, man.  Nice.  Drop-dead gorgeous.  They had a great time there.  Listen, man.  Keep kicking it, man.  You're doing a good job there.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Take it easy, man.  Thank you.  All right, man. 
[00:09:30]  Next caller.  How can I help you, sir?  Or ma'am?  It's got me from New York.  You know, the situation.  I love the show.  Did you ever fucking lick Snooki's an asshole?  You think I'm the situation, huh?  You're the fucking situation, yeah.  You think I sound like a Jersey Shore...  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Because I'll tell you the truth.  Jersey Shore and my type are like oil and water.  We don't mix.  Are you sure? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  You're wearing that tight T-shirt right now.  I can tell.  All right.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Talk to you later.  You are wearing that shirt.  Oh, yes.  Don't tell them.  Come on.  They can't see that.  Hey, caller.  How you doing?  Yeah, you.  The one that's confused.  I'm talking to you.  All right.  I guess you're not there.  You should give out the phone number again.  No, they...  What?  Our number?  Yeah.  Hello?  Caller?  You there?  Yeah.  What's up?  Nominate Pips.  What'd you say? 
[00:10:30]  Nominate Pips.  Nominate Pips?  Yeah, for Ron and Fez.  All right.  I'll take a note of that.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Eric.  Listen.  The call's been great.  We'll go back to the calls in a second.  I just want to play that bit with Opie getting a ticket while riding a bike.  Is that cool?  You sure you want to do that?  The phones just keep blowing up.  Every time you hang up, they fill up again.  All right.  So you want me to keep answering these guys?  They love you.  Go for it.  I love them, too.  Caller, how can I help you?  You're on the air.  Hey, Maz. 
[00:11:00]  What's your favorite UFC fighter?  My favorite UFC fighter...  Somebody get this speck of burrito!  Nice.  You see how I let you finish?  Shut the fuck up.  Next caller.  How can I help you?  Hello.  Hello.  Talk to me.  Hey, Marsh.  Sir.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm doing okay.  How you doing?  Hey, hey.  I'm great.  My name's John Kane.  I just want to let you know...  John Kane?  I love you.  You love me. 
[00:11:30]  I'm from Lanzo, Pennsylvania.  Right.  Why do you love me, John Kane?  I just want to find out what color boxers you're wearing.  Let me check.  Hold on.  They're gray.  Oh, thank you so much.  I'm just jizzing my pants.  All right.  Next caller.  How can I help you?  Hey, Mars.  Sir.  Yeah, another story with your men from the Latino Persuasion.  Touching little girls.  South Park Mexican, a rapper in Houston,  got locked up for, I don't know, 
[00:12:00]  close to life for touching a little 13-year-old girl.  So, just another story.  Look them up.  SPM.  Thanks a lot.  You know, the thing is this,  people think I'm just, like, making shit up.  And I don't have statistics for you.  I'm trying to find them,  but it's kind of hard to get statistics  just for racial or a specific group,  I guess, people frown on that.  But it's there.  It happens.  It happens in our culture quite a bit.  Not that it's tolerated. 
[00:12:30]  Like I've said before,  if the father does catch you,  we love our kids so much  that we will probably wind up doing life for our kids.  So, these kid touches out there,  watch yourselves, motherfuckers.  Anyhow, next caller.  Caller 973.  Hey, what's up, Mars?  That's you.  Hey, man.  On the flip side of things,  there's a lot of homosexuality,  also, in the Latin community.  For instance,  my brother-in-law is gay,  and also,  I went out with a girl  whose son was gay, 
[00:13:00]  and he used to check me out all the time.  Like, any time,  to the point where, like,  when I moved in with her,  I had to stop wearing boxers around the house  because he would check me out.  And then,  the Puerto Rican mothers  are in so much denial  about their children being gay, too.  Dude, you have no idea  about the denial stuff.  Reference,  yeah, reference to the uncles  touching the nieces  when you, like,  inform people of that shit.  They don't believe you.  They think that you're making the shit up. 
[00:13:30]  And you're like,  no, I actually see this.  No, and then,  no, that's my brother.  He can't do that.  So, why?  Because he's your brother,  he can't fucking touch a kid?  So, yeah,  I would,  I don't think it's any more,  any,  any,  Puerto Ricans have any more homosexuals  than any other race,  but there are quite a lot,  and I must admit  that they're pretty flamboyant.  But, you know,  I'm married now,  but before I was married,  the more,  the merrier.  The more gays,  the better.  That way,  I have no competition.  Because, you know,  I have no problem with it, 
[00:14:00]  but my ex broke up with me  because I was,  I was,  I was telling her,  look,  your son is gay  and she didn't want to believe me.  Right.  He was 15 at the time  and then,  you know,  now a few years later,  look,  he's been up on Facebook  or MySpace  and he's got some  Fabio-type name  and he's gone to,  to fucking,  the,  the film,  the,  whatever gay school  that there is for arts.  He's totally,  totally gay.  But anyway,  thanks for your input. 
[00:14:30]  Thanks for the call, man.  Thank you.  Next caller.  Caller from 903 Area Code.  Mark.  Yes, sir.  That's you.  Look,  I just want to shout out  to the Black Pistons MC.  Big shout out to Jake and Del Rey.  That's it.  Thank you.  Hey, Eric,  we're allowed to do that, right?  They could do shout outs?  It's your show.  If you want to do shout outs,  go ahead.  Well,  I don't want to get in trouble  with the company.  It's your hour.  Do whatever the fuck you want.  No,  that's not true.  Thank you, Eric.  Next caller from the 661 Area Code. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah,  Mars.  Yo,  what's up?  Hey,  do you need to change your name  to Uranus?  This show is  boring.  But you held on all that time  to talk to me.  What's up with that?  I thought so.  Hey,  704 Area Code,  how can I help you?  Hey,  I want to send them back.  All right,  you'll get them  next week.  Bye.  337 Area Code,  how can I help you?  Yeah,  this is Bruce  and I've got a washer 
[00:15:30]  and dryer for sale.  I'm asking $50 a piece.  I've also got a shortage.  484,  how can I help you?  What's going on,  Mars?  How you doing,  buddy?  Not bad.  Hey,  so are you just doing  jiu-jitsu  or all around MMA?  Well,  my main focus  is judo and jiu-jitsu.  Actually,  judo,  but,  you know,  not as good  as I want to be.  And boxing?  Yes,  we do all that,  but you know what  the thing is  with this MMA stuff,  everybody's doing MMA, 
[00:16:00]  which is great  and you need to be  all around,  but you should always  fall back on some discipline,  I believe.  That's my belief.  There should be  some foundation.  Let it be boxing,  karate,  kung fu,  whatever the hell it is.  But from there,  you'll grow  and span out  and learn all the other  techniques that you need to know.  But you have to have fundamentals.  How much are you weighing?  180,  185 right now.  180.  And I'm 5'7",  so I'm a little thicker than you.  Like,  5'7", 
[00:16:30]  people normally fight,  you know,  160,  150.  But,  you know,  I don't do it like,  I'm not going to compete.  I do it to protect myself.  So at 180,  if I punch you in the head,  you're going to feel it.  Yeah.  Well,  I'm about 275.  I do boxing.  I was going to see  if we could get some sparring going,  but I'm afraid  I might knock you out  or something,  you know what I mean?  Yeah,  you're a pretty big guy,  but you know,  I have guys like you  in the dojo,  so it's not something  that I'm afraid of.  I got to get,  you know,  you got to be used  to that kind of shit.  As long as you don't 
[00:17:00]  take me down  and,  you know,  break my leg or nothing.  Yeah,  you big guys  don't like being taken down  and you have a problem  with getting up  is what it is.  Exactly.  Yeah.  All right,  Mark.  Thanks a lot,  buddy.  You're doing a good job.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Next caller from 267.  How can I help you?  Hey,  good morning,  Mars.  How you doing?  How you doing,  buddy?  Hey,  okay.  I just wanted to tell you  that you're sounding  pretty good there.  It's not easy  coming in cold  and doing a show,  but you sound great,  so I just wanted  to support.  Thank you,  man.  I appreciate that,  man.  You know,  people,  let me tell you,  this is not planned. 
[00:17:30]  No one told me  I was going to do this today.  I had a pretty,  how can I say,  recreational weekend,  so I'm not,  you know,  I'm here  and I'm doing this.  It's,  let me tell you,  the guys,  ONA and Jimmy  talking for four hours.  Yes,  I'm brown nosing,  whatever the hell  you want to call it,  but those guys  have a lot,  I give them a lot  of credit,  man.  They have a lot  of skill and talent  to just be able  to talk and to be funny  and to talk about a topic 
[00:18:00]  and to sound like,  you know what the hell  you're talking about,  even though when you  don't know what  you're talking about,  not saying that ONA  and Jim don't know  what they're talking about,  but just you need  to act like you know  what you're talking about  and entertain people.  That's so hard.  So,  I'm trying my best.  Might be my first  and last time doing this,  who knows.  Why don't you tell people  about your weekend?  You said you had  a very recreational weekend.  What'd you do?  Well,  what I did though  was on Saturday  I went to the Bronx Zoo.  Let me tell you people  out there, 
[00:18:30]  they hate to be local,  but New York City  has one of the best  zoos in the country.  I went to the Bronx Zoo  with my kids  and my family  and I'm telling you  I had a blast.  I could have spent  more time there.  As a matter of fact,  I will.  I went ahead  and bought the membership,  annual membership  to the Bronx Zoo,  which gives me admission  to the New York Aquarium  and the Queen Zoo,  Central Park Zoo  and Prospect,  something or the other.  But great,  great stuff.  Did that. 
[00:19:00]  So I did a lot  of family-oriented stuff  and I didn't prepare  for anything like this.  So I was just coming in,  doing my regular day job  and then I hear  that I'm called.  But I still think  that shit was fixed.  I don't think  that there was  an actual spinning wheel  because I didn't see it  and I don't think  that everybody's name  was on it.  I think it was just  my name pulled out  of a hat.  But anyhow,  here I am.  Love ya.  Next caller from 574.  How can I help you? 
[00:19:30]  Hey, Marth.  How you doing today, buddy?  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  You sound great.  Checking in from  South Bend, Indiana.  Robbie T.  and Rob Huey  both want to suck your dick.  Wow, but those guys  sound like guys.  Well,  they've heard about you.  Really?  But I'm not into that, man.  I don't, you know,  swing that way.  Maybe Sam does.  I'll ask him.  Thank you, buddy.  Next caller.  This is a caller  from 630.  How can I help you?  Hey.  Yeah,  this is Mr. 
[00:20:00]  Jones with the  Immigration Department.  I'm sorry.  I had someone else  talking to me  at the same time.  What did you say?  This is Mr.  Jones with the  Immigration Department.  All right.  Don't need to talk to him  because I am legally  in the country.  Anyway,  next caller from 978.  How can I help you?  Hey, Marth.  Yes.  Marth, how are you, buddy?  How you doing?

Where did you do  TV in Germany?  Uh, Frankfurt.

[00:22:30]  Why do you like that?  Because you could be  very brave over a phone.  You know?  I can't.  It's very,  it's very, uh,  okay.  Well, I got it.  Um, line two, three, nine.  How can I help you?  Area code two, three, nine.  Hey, Mars.  Hey, how you doing?  How's it going, buddy?  Be nice,  because I have the power  to hang up on you.  Okay, well,  I just have one question.  Tell me.  What does cum taste like?  See, I wouldn't know.  But I,  that's not being mean.  You're asking a valid question.  You tell me.  Do you, have you tasted it?  I don't know.  I just wanted to know, 
[00:23:00]  because they always ask  that Rana Fez  from 11 to 3,  so I figured you would know.  Right, right, right.  Area code 870,  how can I help you?  Yeah, I made it live  on national radio,  and I would like to know  if you ever tasted  a bloody pussy.  No, I have not,  and I believe I answered  that about a couple  of weeks ago,  but no, I have not.  Do the Spanish guys  have the thing  like the black guys do  about not admitting  going down on a girl?  No, that's absolutely  not true.  They eat pussy all the time.  They even eat it,  you know, 
[00:23:30]  when it's, you know,  bleeding,  but I don't.  I don't like that  copper taste.  Anyway, line,  area code 917,  how can I help you?  Eso sí que es.  ¿Qué estás haciendo ahí, Mars?  Sí, sigue hablando.  I like potato soup.  Do you like potato soup?  Maybe.  I like Steve Wilkos.  What about Steve?  Would you like  Steve Wilkos?  I don't really get  what the fuck you're saying, man.  What about baseball fuzz?  Do you like baseball fuzz?  See, this, 
[00:24:00]  hey, Eric,  I think he's getting off  on your voice.  Oh, is that what's going on there?  I think so.  That was kind of weird.  I thought it was like  something racial.  It wasn't racial.  Oh, man,  we're getting like,  uh,  the phones just keep blowing up.  You really want me  not to play the bit  and continue talking to you?  Well, it's up to you.  I mean,  everybody wants to talk to you.  Um,  but I don't want to,  this is not like an audition  for me,  trust me,  okay?  I'm done,  if I get a job like this  and make millions of dollars  like my boys,  hell yeah,  you know,  if I could be part of that clan,  that's great. 
[00:24:30]  But I do have to play,  well, you know,  group.  No,  I don't mean like  that type of clan.  Like group,  boys,  homies.  Um,  but I do have to play these bits  because I know I don't want to,  I don't want to upset the boys.  Well,  if you want to play a bit,  may I make a suggestion?  Yes.  Um,  we can save the Opie bit,  but maybe go into the Anthony bit  that I have on the list there for you.  The spankings?  Yeah.  Oh,  because of the Mexicans?  Yeah,  we'll read the description.  Uh-huh.  Okay,  this bit that we're going to play next,  it's,  uh, 
[00:25:00]  Anthony talking about spankings,  the Mexicans,  um,  and talks about getting spanked by his dad  while living in California.  He shares other stories about his life out there  along with the Mexican  who tried to molest him.  Wow,  what a surprise.  Topical.  Okay,  so,  hit it.  After O&A Live.  There was never any thought  to my spankings,  never in love,  out of love.  My spankings came out of anger  from one or two of my parents 
[00:25:30]  for something I did  that pissed them off.  Spankings?  And it wasn't a spanking,  and it was a fucking,  spanking is like,  like,  oh,  naughty,  naughty.  These were like,  well,  with a fucking belt,  with a leather belt on my ass  laying down on the bed  with like,  as he spoke what I did.  And every syllable,  it was like,  what did you do  with that clock?  You broke it  and should make sure 
[00:26:00]  it is fixed  the correct way.  I'm like,  what the fuck?  I could stop.  He got the syllables.  Yeah,  it was like every word  he would hit me with  and every syllable.  See,  my father was always out of anger.  He'd always go,  now go in there  and put that dress on,  and then he'd make me  traipse out,  and every time  he'd smack me,  I'd have to say,  I'm a pretty girl,  but I don't behave.  Norton wearing a dress  and Doc Martens. 
[00:26:30]  You know the song  Celebrate,  Celebrate.  Yeah,  I love that song.  Celebrate,  dance to the music.  I think it's,  no,  not that one.  Slide in a Family Stone.  Yeah,  is that them?  Yeah.  Good Times?  I was singing that.  Celebrate Good Times?  No,  no,  not that one.  The Electric Slide?  Yeah.  No,  it was the one,  I thought it was,  Celebrate,  dance to the music.  Dance to the music.  I thought it was  Three Dog Night.  Nah,  maybe.  Is it Sly?  Yeah,  Three Dog Night.  Whatever.  That one.  Okay.  I was singing that  early one Saturday morning. 
[00:27:00]  I was singing that  early one Saturday morning,  and I was a kid,  very young,  but I didn't know,  and then I started singing  Celebrate,  celebrate,  dance to the music,  and then I'd go,  masturbate,  masturbate,  dance to the music,  just because it was  a word I heard,  and not knowing why  or anything.  My father comes out  hungover,  all groggy,  out of the room,  like rubbing his eye,  and just walks up to me,  and goes,  whack,  right across the face.  I fell off the table  because I was singing  on the table,  like I had a microphone, 
[00:27:30]  and I'm like,  celebrate,  celebrate,  dance to the music,  masturbate,  masturbate,  dance to the music,  and wham,  he smacks me,  I fly off the table  not knowing why  he just fucking did it.  But the best part  is he was still  rubbing his eye.  Oh,  he's still like,  he's tired,  because he's laying  in bed in his underwear  probably going,  what the fuck  is that kid saying?  Actually,  my cousin had a similar  situation when  my grandmother  was sitting here  and she was on  the back of the couch.  She's on the back  of the couch  and she goes,  I got cum on Eileen 
[00:28:00]  and my grandmother  smacked her  over the back of the couch.  Over the back of the couch.  I got cum on Eileen.  All right.  Masturbate.  Masturbate.  Masturbate.  Maybe they didn't want you  to become a hack  some power to you guys.  Yeah,  that was it.  Jesus,  my career.  It would have been worse  if he came out in chaps  like swinging a belt  like a lasso  and doing it.  And actually showing me  what I was singing about.  Sing, boy.  Celebrate and masturbate.  There's a theme  to all your dad's stories.  He was very worried  that you were going 
[00:28:30]  to become a little  light in the loafers  or something.  Gay?  Any father,  I think,  has that in the back  of the head,  but that was like  where the forefront  of my dad was like,  you know,  you're in man training.  When I went out  to California,  I was like,  you're in man training.  What do I got to do today?  All right,  look,  you want to drink a beer?  Yeah,  that'd be great.  I'd love to drink a beer  with the guys,  you know,  drink a nice cold Coors.  You're 12 years old,  drinking with the guys.  Okay,  sit on this bull  for eight seconds 
[00:29:00]  and I'll let you have a beer.  Are you kidding?  And it was a Brahma bull,  but it wasn't one of those  you see at the rodeo,  the giant ones.  It was a baby,  but it wasn't a little tiny one.  Big enough for a 12-year-old.  It was a scale for my size.  Who did it look like  in this room right now?  Ah,  Bob.  Like Bobby.  Oh,  Bobby.  It's all right.  And I got on the thing  and they strap your hand in  and let it out of the gate  and I fell right off  on my ass.  But you know something?  They gave me the beer anyway. 
[00:29:30]  But they laughed.  They were all laughing  and then they're going,  now get out of there,  get out of the arena  because the thing turns around  to kill you.  You were there  when you'd fall off.  Yeah,  it was like fun.  It was your dad  and his friends  getting drunk  and making you do silly things.  I would do that  and then they'd have parties  over this guy  Jimmy Jackson's house.  Jimmy Jackson is a guy,  he was crazy  and he had this  rent string of horses  and he used to weld things.  So he welded together  a chariot  and hooked it up to a horse  and rode through town.  Central Iceland?  No,  this was out in California. 
[00:30:00]  And the horse got spooked  and ran between  two parked cars  and just ran,  the chariot hit these cars  and just destroyed.  It's amazing the damage  a chariot can do  to a couple of cars.  But these are the people  we're dealing with.  So they would party  and drink  and get all drunk.  So I went around back  to take a leak  and there was this Indian woman,  you know,  the like out west,  Indian women  and her husband.  That's not politically correct,  they're wild Indian.  Wild Indian,  right,  right,  red skin.  Out there.  Wild Indians, yeah.  And she was married 
[00:30:30]  to this guy  that just got out of prison  and she was laying there  and she had like her top  almost off,  it was a halter top  kind of thing  and she goes,  you want to take a roll  in the hay?  And I'm just kind of  standing there like,  oh boy,  oh mixed signals  because you know  my hormones are gone  and I kind of want it.  Smoke signals?  But her husband  reminded me of,  who was Gans' partner?  Billy Bear.  Billy Bear.  I'm Billy Bear  with a big knife  for 48 hours? 
[00:31:00]  He wanted no part of that.  So I like ran away all scared  but it was nothing  but like sexual attraction  by older women  or sometimes  old Mexican men.  What was,  yeah,  the Mexican man.  Mexican man tried to pick me up  when I was out in California.  Yeah,  I'm just sitting there  and again,  everybody's drunk  and this Mexican guy  comes up and goes,  hey,  you wanna go in the bushes?  Over there.  I was like,  excuse me?  He goes,  me and you,  we go in the bushes 
[00:31:30]  and my father heard it.  That's how fun.  I know.  Me,  Mexican guy in the bushes,  nice unclipped.  And your father heard it?  Oh,  my father heard it  and beat the piss  out of this guy  in front of his relatives  because he was like  a relative of Mexican guys  that had a stable  right next to ours  and that was where  the party was  and just like  bounced this guy  off of this car.  He was like,  what the fuck  did you say  to my son,  you motherfucker?  Just pounded him  and then the Mexicans  were like,  Joey,  Joey,  calm down,  it's okay.  He's a fucking asshole 
[00:32:00]  and they kicked him  out of there,  you know?  It was some good times.  Oh,  good times.  What about the story  where they set you up?  Yeah,  that was Jimmy Jackson's  house too.  Jimmy Jackson was leaving  to go to the auction  to pick up more  fucking dog meat horses  for his rent string.  His rent string was pathetic.  It was horses  that were diseased.  Yeah,  I got two stories.  You got to tell  the one you're telling  and then you got to  tell the horse story.  Oh yeah,  that one too.  That was another  Jimmy Jackson one.  Jimmy Jackson is like  quite the character  out in California  and he's always 
[00:32:30]  scamming stuff  and so he was going  to Chino  to buy some horses  so I was left  to run the rent string  with his wife Patty  who was this young  blonde woman.  So Patty was,  he goes,  Patty's sleeping.  He goes,  don't worry about it.  Just take care  of the rent string  and I saw his truck  pull away.  Well,  apparently he,  well,  he pulls away.  I see that.  I go into the house  to get something to eat  and I hear Patty go,  Anthony.  I was like,  okay,  I look in the room  and she's sitting there 
[00:33:00]  with the sheet  just pulled up  above her breasts  and she taps on the bed.  She goes,  why don't you come on in here?  I go,  I don't think so.  She goes,  Jimmy's gone.  She goes,  come on in here.  Let's have some fun  and I just kept saying,  I go,  no,  I can't.  How old were you?  Now 12?  I was probably 12 or 13  around there somewhere.  They just fucked with him,  man.  And I just kept insisting no  and the joke was over  at that point  because Jimmy had pulled around back,  gone in the back door  and he was hiding in the closet  and he came out 
[00:33:30]  with a shotgun going,  you son of a bitch,  what are you doing  in this room with my wife?  But it didn't pan out as well  because they were,  they were actually hoping  I would have taken my clothes off  and jumped into bed  with his wife  so the gag  would have really been funny.  Well,  the gag probably wouldn't have happened.  He would have watched you  fuck her and whacked her.  He could have jerked off.  Nice peyote.  And done that.  A lot of peyote  in that freaking ranch.  Jumped in the bed  with your fingers in his wife.  Oh,  would have been great.  Patty was pretty cute,  actually.  I was very tempted.  You sound like you were  grinning it,  yeah.  You said I knew better. 
[00:34:00]  I could have.  I could have actually shot Jimmy  and fucked his wife anyway  and killed her  and then left.  They'd have thought  it was a murder-suicide.  Horse story.  Horse story.  Jimmy Jackson also used  to haul away dead horses.  These stables were all over the place.  A lot of kids had horses  and people had horses  and sometimes the horse would die  and the kid would be,  and Jimmy would go there  and go,  don't worry,  we're taking a nice grave site  and everything  and what Jimmy would do  was take these horses  to a gully on his property  and just dump it  to where the rent string, 
[00:34:30]  when I used to take  the rent horses up,  they would start rearing up  and going,  when you got close to this area  because there's nothing  but these decomposing horse carcasses  like three layers deep.  And you're paying...  There's a holocaust of horses.  And you're paying top dollar  to have Jimmy Jackson  take care of your dead horse.  Take your horse away.  It's going to be a nice grave  on the top of a hill  with a little cross.  A pile of rocks or something.  Instead of just throwing it up  in a gully.  Anthony grew up on Spahn Ranch.  It was just an awful place. 
[00:35:00]  I had a blast though.  So Jimmy was hauling away  a dead horse  and he pulls it in front  of his trailer  to go in to take a piss  or something like that.  And there was a guy there  that wanted to buy a horse.  And Jimmy starts telling him,  he goes,  I got this great horse  that's in the trailer.  He goes,  but it is so out of control,  it's like an unbroken,  that we had to give it  some kind of sedative.  He goes,  it's in the trailer right here.  And the guy's like,  wow,  it's a nice looking horse.  He goes,  but it's really crazy.  So my father got in the trailer 
[00:35:30]  and started kicking the trailer  and Jimmy's like,  oh shit,  he's waking up,  he's waking up.  So he had this needle  and he like pokes the needle  in the horse's nose  and he's like,  all right,  calm down.  And the guy's like,  wow,  that horse is really dead.  Like it was dead,  stone fucking dead.  And this guy was ready  to buy a dead fucking horse  from Jimmy Jackson  because he just loved  the way it looked  because he looked over  the top of the trailer  and Jimmy's petting it,  kind of holding its head down  and putting his hand  over that crusty,  glazed over dead horse eye 
[00:36:00]  and going,  yeah,  because if you hide his eyesight,  he doesn't get as jumpy.  And he stuck a needle in him  and he's like,  all right,  calm down,  boy,  calm down.  And the guy goes,  that's a pretty horse.  How much you want for him?  I don't want to go out  on a limb here,  but I think Jimmy Jackson  was a dick.  Jimmy Jackson  was one of the funniest  motherfuckers  and best character.  He was also,  I swear to you,  one of the most racist guys  I've ever known in my life.  We don't believe that.  He fucking hated black people, 
[00:36:30]  hated them.  And he used to,  he had a kid named Rusty  and a daughter named Shiloh.  And Shiloh had to be  maybe two years old.  And when he wanted  to discipline her,  he would say,  uh-oh, Shiloh,  I see it.  You're turning into a,  and he would say  the N word,  of course.  And she would start crying  and with a little girl voice  go,  I don't want to be a Nigu.  I don't want to be, 
[00:37:00]  and that's how he would,  he would.  And you made that  your ringtone.  But here's the thing.  It was,  you say he was racist.  Yeah.  Her natural instinct  as a two-year-old  was to cry and say,  don't let me be this.  She did not want to be one.  Jesus, Colin.  It was,  maybe being raised  for two years  around this guy,  any time,  like,  we had a lot of Marines  from Camp Pendleton  would come up  to rent horses  on the weekend.  They would want to,  you know,  be cowboys for the weekend.  And I would take them  up into the hills. 
[00:37:30]  Oh,  thank God.  Thank God,  this,  uh,  new,  permanent host  of the show.  Mars,  you've been unbelievable today.  Hi, Ron.  How you doing, sir?  It's,  it's phenomenal.  And I can't wait  to hear,  uh,  you and Dave  on Saturday night.  I think it's going  to be fantastic.  I don't think Sam  will like that very much,  Ron.  Who's Sam? 
[00:38:00]  I don't remember  yesterday's news.  Explain to me again,  who's Sam?  I don't have an answer  for you there.  You know,  I'm not even sure  if you need Dave.  I think if you  and Master Poe  got back together  and did that  martial arts show,  what was that word  that he always said  when there was some,  party rock?  No,  there was some kind  of like,  Oose,  yes,  Oose.  And I really want  to get the Oose  t-shirts going.  Mars,  how have you liked  it so far?  I like it very much.  It's fun.  The feedback  is phenomenal 
[00:38:30]  and I just talked  to Blatter  and he said  that the ratings  are going through  the roof.  I don't know  how he can find  this out this fast.  I guess it's  a people meter,  but it's phenomenal.  Well,  you know,  I have to thank you,  Ron,  for putting this idea  in their heads.  Oh,  good.  Well,  I'm a shit star.  Jay Moore has  already put it  that way.  But I hope  you do the show  again tomorrow,  the following day.  I mean,  finally,  we've got something  that works.  Yeah,  I don't think  that's going  to happen,  Ron.  No,  and I was actually  even,  I talked to Iraq  and he's so much  more relaxed 
[00:39:00]  and having fun.  He said he finally  has a host  that he can work  with.  It's a very nice  vibe around here.  It's a nice thing  that he says there.  No,  you need to do  more of the show  in Spanish  because we have  a lot of  Spanish-speaking  listeners out there.  Well,  I don't want to get  the boys all upset  either.  I have to see  what they like,  you know,  O&A and Jimmy.  First of all,  here's the thing  that you've got  to learn in radio.  You've got to take  on the man  first fucking day,  all right?  You have got to  worry about the Mars show 
[00:39:30]  and whatever the  program director says,  that's bullshit.  You and your listeners  know how to make  a good show, Mars.  Well,  yeah,  I was told that  it's my show  and I can do  whatever I want,  but I highly doubt that.  Really?  Yes.  You've got,  first of all,  it's all about confidence.  Okay.  This business  is all about confidence.  You're in your listeners' head.  You understand  what they need,  what they want.  If the show  needs to be in Spanish,  the show needs  to be in Spanish,  there's no getting  around that Mars.  Okay, 
[00:40:00]  I'll look into it.  And if those guys  sit up there  in their ivory tower  and tell you  something different,  you know,  I mean,  first of all,  sales is going  crazy today.  This is finally  a show  in between  ONA  and Ron and Fez  that they can sell.  I'm told Bacardi's  right on board now.  Perfect.  We should do  very,  very well with them.  Telemundo  should be buying spots.  Let me tell you  that Latin market  is a large market. 
[00:40:30]  Don't I know it?  I watched that  fucking Mexican-US  soccer game  the other night  and they did  the award ceremony  and this is  in Los Angeles  on Fox Sports  and the whole thing  was done in Spanish.  There was no English  at all.  Of course,  Los Angeles is Mexico.  I didn't know that.  Now I'm learning everything.  Los Angeles,  the Angels.  That's what that is?  Lost Angels.  Los.  Yeah,  so it's the city  of the Lost Angels.  No,  the Angels.  Lost.  I always thought  they were lost.  No, 
[00:41:00]  they're not lost.  The T's not there.  Well,  that fucking makes it  a lot less romantic  that I've given a credit.  I thought they were  Lost Angels,  which I love the idea of.  You said that you used  to ride with the Hells Angels  for a couple years.  How did that work out?  What would that be  in Spanish?  The Hells Angels,  este,  Ángeles,  the demon,  MC,  Ángeles,  del carajo,  I guess.  Carajo is bad.  That's a bad word.  I wouldn't know  how to translate that.  You don't say  any bad words.  Oh,  a lot of bad words.  Very bad words.  Now,  I also noticed this. 
[00:41:30]  The Spanish audience,  the Mexican audience,  they would yell  every time our goalie  kicked the ball.  It was,  I can't think of the word.  It's like puta  or something like this.  It means male prostitute  or...  Puto.  Puto.  They yell puto?  Yeah,  they yell puto  every time you  kick the ball.  That's so nice.  Which is like  saying a gay prostitute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or can you be  a puto  who also 
[00:42:00]  sleeps with women?  See,  the thing,  okay,  Mexicans use  certain words  differently.  For Puerto Rican,  a puto  means a pimp.  I see.  See,  now,  but the Mexicans  might use it differently.  Like,  they use cabrón.  Uh-huh.  Cabrón,  actually,  they use it a lot.  Right.  And that means  that you  are letting your wife  sleep around  and you know it  among the Puerto Ricans.  So,  if you want  to start  a real  violent fist fight,  you call  a Puerto Rican  a cabrón. 
[00:42:30]  Isn't it interesting  that white people  don't even have a phrase  that you let your wife  sleep around?  It never even occurs  to have that phrase.  Now,  I've always thought  of Puerto Ricans  as Mexicans  who can swim.  Is that  going to  far?  Has that almost  come across?  actually,  we could fly  because we fly over.  We don't swim over.  You don't swim over.  But I mean,  just swim  yourselves.  You never see  Mexicans in the water.  Puerto Ricans  do swim,  though.  Do you swim?  Yes, sir.  Do you scuba?  No.  It always gets me.  Puerto Rico  has those beautiful reefs 
[00:43:00]  and then when you go out  to them,  you only see white people.  Yeah.  They couldn't afford  to go out there.  Really?  Yes.  It's a fucking snorkel.  Pair of flippers.  It's not that big a deal.  Well,  first of all,  Marge,  you are  doing fantastic  and for one day,  this crossover  is fun to do.  No shit stirring,  no baby talk.  I don't have to hear  about Jess constantly.  You know,  you hit the nail  on the head, man.  There's no Sam around me  to fuck with me. 
[00:43:30]  That's true.  And he drives you crazy, right?  does he ever, man?  Does he ever?  So,  how many people  were on the  Spin the Wheel today?  Well,  I think I was bamboozled.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  I don't think  there was a fucking wheel.  I don't think  there was other names  on it.  I think my name  just got pulled out  of a hat and said,  you will do it today.  Now,  I remember the other day  Opie told Sam  that absolutely  cannot happen.  He wants a real wheel.  He wants to make  that deal.  I don't understand this.  Yeah.  Well,  if Opie said it,  then it's true. 
[00:44:00]  Then there was a wheel.  But Sam,  you know,  promised Opie  and then go,  as you say,  goes right back  into another one  of his works,  as he says,  in his wrestling background.  Absolutely.  I believe this is a work.  Oh,  unbelievable.  What do you have  planned the rest of the day?  Do you got to do  voiceover work?  Are you doing some tracking?  What's happening  for you today?  Not much, man.  After this,  I'll do some more engineering  and then go home.  How are you doing, Ron?  Well,  thanks for asking, Mars.  I'm doing fantastic.  We've got, 
[00:44:30]  I've got a new co-host  today myself,  Frank Watson.  So we're all  very, very excited.  Frank Watson.  I don't even know much  about Frank Watson,  but we're all  very, very excited  that he's here.  So today's his debut?  Today's his debut.  And the way it's been going,  it's a debut  plus farewell.  That's how it's happened  so far.  Okay.  But today,  you know,  Bladder's running a bunch  of these guys through here.  See how you get along  with this guy.  See how you get along  with that guy.  We don't know  what's happening right now 
[00:45:00]  why Fez takes time off.  So the guys last week,  I presume they didn't work out.  No.  Even though I was a big fan  of the D-man,  I thought he was fantastic.  But no.  So far,  every single one of them  has frozen up  during the show  and not been able  to finish the program.  I see.  They all start strong, though.  They're very, very strong starters.  Right.  But they don't have  what you have,  the ability to take it  from A to Z  and hit every letter  along the way. 
[00:45:30]  Well, you know what?  I think it probably  has to do with intimidation.  The boss is in the room.  I don't see myself  as the boss.  Yeah, but everybody else  sees you as the boss.  See, that's wrong, though.  That's what I tried  to tell you before.  When you grab that mic,  you've got to be the guy.  All right?  Now, in here,  you're Rico Suave.  I'm going to say it in terms  that you...  Rico Suave.  Oh, that's rude.  See, this is why  fucking women love you.  No, actually,  I had a lot of gay guys  telling me that they wanted  to suck my dick.  I don't know if they were gay,  but they were guys.  Well, if they wanted 
[00:46:00]  to suck your dick,  I would assume  that they're gay.  But, you know,  it's a whole new time  in New York City.  We're very gay friendly now.  Someone wanted to marry me.  See, that happens.  This is what happens  when you're the guy  with the microphone.  Suddenly, people see you  completely different.  In my case,  it's always been women,  but for you,  it's going to be dudes.  I don't think  I'm going to like that so much.  It's, uh,  you're a fucking puta.  There's nothing  you can do about it. 
[00:46:30]  Now, is that a good thing  or a bad thing for you?  Puta.  Puta is a female version  of a prostitute.  All right, so...  Puto.  Puto.  Puto.  So the O and the A,  gigantic fucking difference.  Well, it's the gender difference,  but again,  it's the...  depending on who  you're talking to,  if it's Mexicans,  Puto's not good.  If it's Puerto Ricans  and he's a thug,  Puto's good  because he wants  to be a pimp daddy  and all that good stuff.  Right, I see.  You don't even get along  with Mexicans.  Oh, no, I do.  I do.  Well, who is it  that you don't get along  with, Colombians?  No, I get along  with everyone. 
[00:47:00]  Me, personally,  I get along with everyone.  My actual, like,  New York Ricans,  yeah, they have a problem  with Colombians.  And I never heard  too much of the Mexicans,  though.  Well, there's not a lot  of them on the East Coast.  You can't mess with Mexicans.  You gotta be careful.  Mexicans, you gotta be careful.  Mexicans are angry people.  They get the job done.  Well, who are the little  Spanish people  that bicycle their food  to us here in the city?  Who are those?  A lot of them are  from Guatemala  or El Salvador.  Uh-huh.  They're from Central America.  Those are also people 
[00:47:30]  that get the job done  when it needs to get done.  They get every job done.  They are the most  fantastic people  in this town.  There's no doubt about it.  They are the only people  in New York  that can say,  hey, that guy's working.  Because I don't see  a lot of other people working.  They do work a lot.  They have a lot of  dominio tasks  that we need done  in the city.  Well, I don't want  to stop you  from the wrap-up.  You have a special wrap-up  that you're doing here today.  You have a way to get out.  You have that signature phrase  that you say goodbye 
[00:48:00]  to your audience with.  You know, I was doing fine, man,  until you just asked me  that question.  No, dude.  You should always...  I would do something  in Spanish.  You know?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I would go out in Spanish.  Go out in Spanish.  How about if we  go back to your boy  Master Poe?  Okay.  And maybe play something  like with the us.  Okay.  Eric?  Okay.  We'll say goodbye.  And then I'll do it.  All right, guys.  This has been fun.  It's been great, man.  Hope to do it again.  I doubt I will. 
[00:48:30]  But in any event,  God bless.  Take care.  Peace.  And Ron and Fez  are coming up next.  And Ron and Fez  are coming up next.  Oos.  Can I have an oos?  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  He was in a white.  Oos.  Oos. 
[00:49:00]  Oos.  That was fantastic. </pre>
