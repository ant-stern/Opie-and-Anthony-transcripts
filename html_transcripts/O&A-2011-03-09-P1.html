<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton introducing themselves and acknowledging the show's history of controversy and FCC run-ins.  They immediately launched into a discussion about a brutal hockey hit by Zdeno Chara on Max Pacioretty, followed by Anthony's furious rant about the New York Islanders organization, specifically his fired ticket rep and alleged deceptive season ticket pricing.  A caller, Joe from Philly, contributed his own experience with dangerous rink designs.  The conversation then took a bizarre turn, discussing Charo's age and appearance, before pivoting to the troubled Broadway production of *Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark* and the involvement of their friend Rob Bartlett.  This led to a brief discussion of the Harry Potter cast's post-franchise careers.  The hosts then addressed the death of Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr, focusing on his addiction struggles and his ironic portrayal as a success story on *Celebrity Rehab* before his passing. The first hour concluded with a detailed analysis of Charlie Sheen's evolving online broadcasts, particularly his improved production quality using a TriCaster system (which Anthony helped promote), and Sheen's calculated attacks on former colleagues, prompting reflection on the hosts' own experiences with powerful figures in the media.  They also briefly touched on 9/11 helicopter footage and Peter King's proposed hearings on radical Islam.

The second segment opened with the hosts criticizing politically correct crime investigation methods, arguing for ethnicity- and religion-based targeting, citing examples from Germany and Israel. This transitioned into a discussion of the firings of Helen Thomas and Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder for expressing unpopular opinions.  The majority of this segment was dedicated to a review of Charlie Sheen's "Sheen's Corner," specifically episode four, detailing his erratic behavior, profanity-laced rants, the "Malibu Messiah" persona, and his attacks on Chuck Lorre.  The hosts mimicked Sheen’s style and speculated on his relationship with his father, Martin Sheen. The segment ended with comments on Avril Lavigne's recent SiriusXM visit, her reluctance to take photos with fans, and a humorous anecdote about one host's girlfriend's reaction to his failed attempt at a photo with Lavigne. The hosts also discussed their celebrity photo collections and the commercial viability of celebrity coffee table books.  This section was rife with homophobic and racist slurs.

The third segment started with a caller's humorous story about farting on a coworker.  The hosts then shifted to promoting Jimmy Norton's "Most Embarrassing Tapes," his new comedy CD "Despicable," and a comparison (with vulgar language) to Daniel Tosh's sales.  A "mystery band" segment followed, revealing the band to be Don Wiki Wicklin's project, a surprise to the hosts despite their prior acquaintance. Wicklin's music and website were discussed.  The conversation then moved to Camden, New Jersey's high crime rate and police force reduction, coupled with the rise in aggravated assaults.  The hosts expressed frustration with city mismanagement using strong language,  and discussed a satirical news website reporting on the situation with highly offensive racial slurs in its headline. They then discussed a news story about a father's vow for revenge on his murdered child's killer if released from prison, expressing outrage at the justice system.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the Catholic Church's handling of sex abuse allegations, expressed with strong language and disgust, followed by the playing of Jimmy Norton's embarrassing tape—a humorous sketch involving false accusations against him.

The final segment began with discussion of Uncle Paul's age and a bizarre anecdote about urine sample collection for sugar testing.  This transitioned into a racially charged comment about MTV Cribs, followed by Bill Burr's views on church and religion, including a humorous debate on Jesus's skin color.  Fat Tuesday and Ash Wednesday were briefly mentioned before a discussion of Tiki Barber's return to football, attributed to his impending divorce.  The main focus then shifted to airing and analyzing Jimmy Norton's embarrassing 1996 Friday Night Videos appearance. Norton discussed his anxieties, difficult relationship with his father, and comedic style at the time.  The segment continued with discussion of Norton’s upcoming appearances, Bobby Kelly's verified Twitter account, a lengthy bit about a "Lady Trucker," and concluded with a reaction to a video comparing the sizes of celestial bodies, followed by promotional talk about the upcoming hour and further jokes.  Only Jimmy Norton was a guest in studio during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable. Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck. I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, morning.  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  I guess we start out with a little hockey.  Travis is showing us the big hit in the Bruins-Canadians game last night.  That looked painful.  Yeah, I don't know this one, Travis.  You gotta help us out.  Where are you, man?  I was too busy watching a Bill Hicks documentary and the Islanders beat the Maple Leafs. 
[00:01:30]  Oh.  You guys just hung on to win that one, right?  Yeah, overtime.  53 seconds left in overtime.  Making it very painful for us Islanders fans.  Because they have a very outside shot at the playoffs.  Best team in hockey since the second half of the season or something.  Who's that?  The Islanders.  Who are the best in the division?  What was I reading?  I gotta get the stat correct.  How'd they manage that?  I know the Devils are like...  The Devils and the Islanders.  The Devils are ridiculous now. 
[00:02:00]  Which were two shitty teams.  Are playing unbelievable hockey.  Where the fuck was it?  It doesn't matter.  Most people don't give a fuck.  It's fine.  But the Islanders are doing really well, Anthony.  But after losing 16, 17 games in a row, it's kind of dumb.  It just decided out of nowhere to come to the table?  Or is it the luck factor?  They're way over 500 in the last 40 games.  But before that 40 game stretch... 
[00:02:30]  You're only 10 points out of the last spot.  Yeah, I know.  And we're gonna make it really close in the end.  You just gotta pass Florida, New Jersey, Atlanta, Toronto, Carolina, and Buffalo.  And then you're right in it.  There's nothing I can say of that.  But man, did I give somebody in the Islanders organization an earful yesterday.  A talking to?  Well, what happened was...  We'll get to that hit.  I couldn't go to the game yesterday.  I'm not really going to hockey games anymore. 
[00:03:00]  I've only gone to a few games in the last three or four months.  You're not boycotting anymore, though, since they're better?  I'm just there.  I don't even know how to explain it.  I'm just kind of there.  Because I've been a fan since I was a little kid.  So I'm just kind of there.  But I told the guy on the phone yesterday, you lost me.  I'm not getting tickets next year.  Because what happened was, I couldn't go to the game, so I wanted my tickets in my brother's name.  Because he's got young kids and stuff.  And they don't care.  They don't care the team is not going to make the playoffs most likely. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, just happy to be out.  They're just happy to be checking out an NHL game.  And a lot of people are just happy to check out an NHL game.  That's fine.  Yeah, it's a night out.  So I call my ticket guy and say, hey, could you leave my tickets at Will Call for my brother?  The guy goes, I would love to do that, but the Islanders fired me.  I'm like, what?  And then he gave me an earful.  Supposedly, the Islanders, this is how terrific this organization is.  There were a bunch of sales guys that were about to hit bonus. 
[00:04:00]  So instead of paying the bonus, they fired all the guys to save that money.  That's how desperate this fucking organization is.  Well, I guess it worked if they're winning, huh?  I guess this guy was fucking the team up.  And then the guy, this is when you get the real info, is when a guy that's kind of close to you leaves.  He goes, I got to be honest with you.  The Islanders are ripping you off.  And they're ripping off a lot of people.  I go, why don't you tell me what that's about?  He goes, you know your seats that are relatively expensive and all?  I go, yeah.  He goes, well, they're now selling the seats in your area for $50 a game. 
[00:04:30]  $50 a game.  Safe to say I was paying a lot more than that.  So why doesn't the Islanders organization come to me, a season ticket holder, and go, look, here's some money back because we're now selling these seats a lot cheaper.  You never had to be a season ticket holder.  You could have got seats in that area for $50 a game.  Oh, I don't think giving money back is in there.  Never will they do that.  Of course, of course.  But they're hoping we don't find this shit out.  So then I call the new guy, and he's like, hi, I'm your new rep. 
[00:05:00]  I'm like, well, go fuck yourself.  That was my opening line.  I'm like, no offense to you.  You're just kind of a messenger.  But I'm done with this fucking organization.  I'm done.  Well, what can we do to keep you?  Nothing.  Nothing is what you could do.  I understand when your team is shitty.  It happens.  It's the chance you take as a season ticket holder.  I go, but there's no desire to go to the Coliseum and watch the games because the presentation sucks.  The arena sucks.  The plastic seats suck. 
[00:05:30]  Very old school.  The concessions suck.  I don't feel like waiting on line for a half hour to just take a leak because you don't have enough bathrooms.  I don't feel like sitting in my seat the entire game because if you do go out into the concourse,  you can't move because the hallways are too narrow.  There's no difference in that place since I was going to concerts in high school.  And you know what?  You're absolutely correct.  Not one thing has changed.  I go to Rangers games. 
[00:06:00]  I go to the Devils games.  I go to the Flyers games.  I hit all those arenas every season.  Not a lot.  One or two here and there, right?  I didn't make a Flyers game yet this year, but I certainly will.  And their presentation is so good.  So if the team sucks, you still kind of go because it's a nice place to be.  You know what I mean?  Did they build new stadiums or is it just improvements?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah, there's new stadiums all over the fucking place.  Arenas because it's hockey.  But, you know.  There you go.  Second row seats for 69 bucks. 
[00:06:30]  Wow.  69 bucks.  But the organization doesn't tell you that because you're locked in.  You're locked in as a faithful fan.  That's your reward.  And the guy goes, look, I hate to tell you this, but you're being ripped off.  And we were told to sell your seats, you know, or around you for $50 a game now.  And my face value is up there.  I mean, but if you're a season ticket holder, it drops down.  50 bucks.  But safe to say it's at least twice that.  Yeah.  Fucking scumbags. 
[00:07:00]  I'm so fucking pissed off.  Guy goes, what show you work for?  I go, don't worry about it.  I said, if we talk a few more times, maybe I'll tell you someday.  But I'm fucking pissed.  And who do I talk to?  Because I know talking to you is going to mean nothing in the end.  Because we were just talking about this yesterday, the customer service, right?  It's horrible.  It's unbelievable.  Horrible.  Unbelievable.  They got your money already.  They don't care.  Yeah, exactly.  Remember that football?  We talked about the Giants saying where they put the seat behind the pole.  Oh, the pole.  The pole.  It's like that's how those organizations, all of them, look at the fans.  They don't give a fuck. 
[00:07:30]  They don't care.  You can't see.  It's a seat.  You can sell it.  Sell it.  Fuck it.  But anyway, we're starting the show with hockey because Travis came in and said, did you see  the hit last night in the Bruins-Canadians game?  So what happened?  Where are you now?  You're over here.  Yeah, I'm over here.  This was in the third, second period.  This is the end of the second period.  I guess this video will be everywhere today, huh?  Yeah.  Certainly on all the sports.  It's on Deadspin if anybody wants to see it.  Okay.  But yeah, it was Chara on the Bruins and he pretty much smashed Max Pacioretty's face 
[00:08:00]  into the glass and now he's in the hospital.  He is out.  It's a pretty brutal hit, though.  I was explaining this to the guys.  The NHL has to do something about that.  There's no glass, obviously, where the guys sit that aren't on the ice, okay?  The benches.  The benches.  So you got the Canadiens bench, I think, was the first bench.  Yeah.  And then there's glass up.  And then, and the glass is only, what, maybe eight feet of glass wide, tops? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, about that.  Yeah, not nice.  And then it's wide open again where the Bruins sit.  Yeah.  And they're wondering if this was a cheap hit and if Chara knew what he was doing.  But that piece of glass, the NHL has to get rid of that during the offseason.  It's stupid to have it there.  Because the guys come up the side like that and you literally could have your face off the  ice, out of the arena or out of the playing surface.  That's what he did.  And if you don't know exactly where you are, you could smash the side of your head into 
[00:09:00]  that, you know, that glass.  I'm trying to see.  Because all glass, isn't it all surrounded by...  No, see where...  No, we'll see how it's open.  Oh, it's open.  It's open by the players' bench.  See, it's open by the bench right there.  It's the Bruins' bench first.  Okay.  And then there's a...  See, there's just one panel of glass that is now up, extending up from the boards.  Between the two benches.  And then it goes where there's no glass again, where the Canadians are sitting in this particular  game.  That piece of glass has got to go.  That's usually where they'll throw, like, TV reporters to do, you know, like, on the 
[00:09:30]  ice.  But when they show, like, nasty hits, when they show the montage of bad hits, you always  see a bunch of really good hits right in that area because you're stopped in your tracks.  Oh, guys have hit that before?  Oh, many times.  That's just a bad design.  Doesn't take away from the fact that Char might have knew what he was doing.  Right?  Yeah, I mean, an argument could be made either way, but I think...  No, I'm just saying, in general, they have to take the glass out.  In this situation, it looks like Char might have knew that glass was coming up and, look, 
[00:10:00]  I'm going to hurt this fucking guy a little bit.  Do you think he did it on purpose?  They've got a history.  And Travis is a Canadians fan, so of course he's going to say it's on purpose.  Is he a dirty player, this guy?  He's a physical player, yeah.  Char is a monster, man.  Hockey players are animals.  Yeah, they really are.  Char is like, I think Char is something like 6'7 before he gets on skates.  Oh, wow, really?  He's a monster.  He used to play for the Islanders, by the way.  6'7 before skates?  Something like that.  I don't know the exact type, but I think he's the tallest player in the NHL. 
[00:10:30]  Like, bent his head back when he hit that thing.  But if that glass isn't there, that guy is fine.  Yeah.  I don't know why they need that glass like that.  It just looks like it's going to be a problem over and over again.  It's like having a highway with a bridge abutment without a guardrail.  Yeah.  So if you're over the line even a little bit, you're just smashing into it full speed.  Correct.  With nothing to deflect you away.  Correct.  So. 
[00:11:00]  Wow.  Yeah, those two teams are having a hell of a year.  Well, we just hope he's all right and hope everything's good with him.  Hey, how about that weather?  Let's talk about that.  That's what every sport's got to be.  You know, our thoughts and prayers are with him.  And speaking of prayers, we're praying for good weather this weekend, aren't we?  Oh, man, let me tell you.  Yeah, forget about him.  Chara is over 7 feet tall on skates.  Ah, ah, skate. 
[00:11:30]  What's his height, though?  Because the skates are only maybe, give you maybe two extra inches, maybe.  I don't know.  Let me say hi to Joe in Philly.  Joe.  Yeah, boy, how are you?  Hey, buddy.  Just wanted to tell you, I played hockey growing up, and pretty much every rink you're going to run into is like that.  And guys, definitely do that on purpose.  You want to try to slam somebody in that glass or that side glass.  It just seems like it's a bad design.  And then eventually someone's going to have their head knocked off.  Yeah, that's nasty. 
[00:12:00]  They've got to separate the teams.  Huh?  They've got to separate the teams somehow.  Yeah, I understand that.  But we've got a lot of great engineers in this country.  Maybe they could throw it to them so they could get a better design.  Yeah.  Because, man, you could lose your head.  You could break your fucking neck.  Has anyone ever been killed?  In hockey?  No.  What's his name?  Almost bled out in front of everybody, though.  Oh, yeah.  Throat hit you.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Is he playing again?  Did he play after that?  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  He's long gone, though.  I mean, that's many years ago.  It's a Charo's.  Charo?  Charo.  6'9".  Danny clicked something and Charo came up.  He's 6'9", but I just wanted to see how tall Charo was.  Coochie, coochie player.  Yeah.  He comes out with a basket of fruit on his head.  Is that Charo, I hope?  No.  No, that's...  What the fuck was that?  With the fruit on the head.  That was Charo, no?  No.  No.  She was really old.  Oldie time. 
[00:13:00]  Would you do Charo?  Yeah.  I would, too.  Absolutely.  Would you do Charo?  Yeah, I would do Charo.  Big old lady text.  She made the rounds.  Carmen Miranda.  She made the rounds last week, and she was looking kind of good on TV.  She's a fucking mess with my kids.  How old is she?  She was around in the 70s, and she was like no kid.  She was around when we were just crawling around in front of our parents' feet.  Come on.  She's...  How old is she?  70?  Hang on.  She has to be at least 70. 
[00:13:30]  Born on 5th January, 51.  51, that's it?  She'll be 70 this year.  Oh, she'll be 70 this year.  All right.  Well, she is 70.  60.  She's 60.  Oh, 60.  Sorry.  What?  She's 60.  Oh, she'll only be 60?  No way.  Get the fuck out.  Fucking way.  She's petting her age.  That's something that you might not know, all right?  Wikipedia does not lie.  That's true.  All right?  Wiki says that she's 60.  You're right.  She's 60.  You're right.  Wow, she's shaving a few.  She has to be.  A few decades.  You think that's what she does every morning? 
[00:14:00]  She just goes and edits her own Wiki.  Edits her own Wiki.  I'm making my birthday very much later than it is.  A coochie coochie.  Oh, boy.  The coochie coochie thing.  Hey, we got Charo on.  Yeah, Bob Hope specials, and she was old.  And he's been dead for years.  He's been dead for a long time.  Jimmy's, to answer Jimmy's question, yeah, Clint Malarchuk, and someone's arguing that  it doesn't matter if they take that piece of glass away because there's glass that starts  up after the bench.  But then there'll be another glass. 
[00:14:30]  But this is an extra bit of glass it seems like you don't really need.  That's all.  They should, what they've got to do is curve it in a little or something.  Or two edges that you could fuck yourself up with is four.  Again, like a guardrail, they've got to curve it in or something.  But that'll probably fuck up the view.  I don't know.  Then the puck will hit that ricochet and hit someone in the crowd.  Maybe they should make the whole thing around.  You know how mad people would be if they'd put foam rubber all the way around and they  couldn't see through?  Foam rubber.  They had to peek over? 
[00:15:00]  Or a blurry bubble wrap everywhere.  You could barely see it.  I don't know who's playing.  And they all wore little badges that said safety first.  You know how mad people would be?  How about SeaWorld glass?  So the players look really distorted and large as they're skating by you.  Fish eye looking.  Oh, God.  Is that Charo?  That's the latest Charo picture?  Oh, is she a disaster?  As long as her pussy didn't smell, I'd go there.  Oh, I'm sure it does.  You think it does?  It smells like menopause.  That is a little rough.  Smells like an abandoned warehouse. 
[00:15:30]  She kept herself together for 60.  She's older than 60.  She's padding.  Definitely.  But, I mean, considering?  Come on.  I'd go there.  What the hell?  Why not?  We'd pick it up.  Oh, well.  We're going to say we're not.  We're going to go without the makeup.  What, you don't like zombie movies?  Oh, I know.  Wow.  That plastic surgery looks rough when you can't put the makeup around the scars.  She loves putting the makeup on and hanging her big old lady tits out.  That's not a bad picture.  Yeah.  Yeah, she cleans up nice.  Where's the bad one? 
[00:16:00]  Do you have, like, a no-  Yeah.  Danny just had one.  You can find that.  The one you just had was bad, where they say, guess who this is.  You never want that.  Guess who this is.  No.  Ugh.  Yeah, Clint.  Clint, uh, Milarchuk, or check, whatever, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good luck to you.  So?  Good luck to you.  Anyway, that was, uh, a big hit last night in hockey that people are going to be talking  about today.  Yeah, he's in the hospital.  He's in the hospital.  What are they saying so far? 
[00:16:30]  Uh, nothing really.  He's-  He was out cold, huh?  Yeah, he was out cold, and he stayed in the hospital all the night.  Literally.  He stayed in the hospital all the night.  On the ice.  And they, uh, they, they, they stopped a period, you were telling me.  Yeah, they ended it with, like, 16 seconds left.  Like Charo did, fucking, 30 years ago.  Oh, look at her.  Yeah, that's not good.  No.  No, it's going to happen.  A hockey player will die somewhere, and then they're going to redesign the rink.  That's how it always happens.  Yeah.  You've got to wait for someone to die.  Someone's got to get killed.  Remember that stupid girl that wasn't paying attention, and then the- 
[00:17:00]  Oh, got the puck in the head.  And the puck got her in the head, and then she died.  Sorry.  If you know her, whatever.  I don't know her.  It just pissed off a lot of people, because it kind of messed up their view a little bit,  because then they had to put the nets up.  Yep.  But they didn't need nets until, uh, somebody got killed.  And then when you take into consideration how many people have seen hockey games,  to how many people are killed watching hockey games, uh, you know, you really don't  have to knee-jerk like that.  You really don't need that.  You don't really need that net.  But they don't want the lawsuits, so. 
[00:17:30]  You just gotta, you always knew when you sat in those seats.  Even now, if you're sitting a little above the glass, you're on high alert, man.  Oh, you better be.  You can't be looking down at your phone the whole game.  No.  There was a puck, when we went to the game a couple months ago, there was a puck like  four or five rows back from us.  Yeah, my seats have been hot this year for pucks.  We've gotten two so far.  And the nephew's very happy.  And they could put as many signs up as they want.  They could literally put a sign up that says, if you get hit by a puck, you cannot fucking 
[00:18:00]  sue us.  It's your fault.  And they could still sue.  Yeah.  Uh.  Negligence.  Spider-Man delayed again.  Yeah, this is just, uh, abominable clusterfuck.  Broadway Spider-Man.  Yes.  Delayed again.  For another three months.  Another three months while they retool.  And they're getting, uh, you two together and I think the director.  And someone's gotta go.  Yeah.  And they're hinting the director's going.  Director.  They've already, uh, blasted out some writers.  Gotten a new writer, uh, new writers in there. 
[00:18:30]  It's just, uh, the technical glitches.  Now, you think it's a disaster because of all these delays?  They were saying on the news on the way in today, the damn thing's making millions of  dollars in just previews.  In previews.  It hasn't officially opened and they're making, they're making money.  It's like, uh, one of those things where, well, people could, someone could die.  I'm gonna go see this.  Wait.  Could you go see it if you want to now in a preview?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Then it's open.  It's basically open.  But they're, they want to have the big.  I know.  That is dumb.  They want to have the big over-the-top opening when they got all the bugs figured out. 
[00:19:00]  But in the meantime, you could, you could see Spider-Man and it's bringing in money.  It's gotta, it's gotta continue to bring money in for them to break even.  Yeah.  It's already made millions, they said.  But they're delaying it again.  Yeah, that, uh, you too, of course, involved in that show.  Maybe that's their thing, to keep, keep, uh.  Just keep postponing it.  Well, it makes it a hot show.  And it gives you an excuse if something fucks up.  It's like, hey, we're in previews.  Yeah, man.  You can't have your money back.  It says right on the ticket.  Previews.  We're, we're in previews.  We're trying to fucking figure this shit out. 
[00:19:30]  For its fifth straight year in previews, Spider-Man.  Yeah, can you imagine?  Catch it now on Broadway.  In previews, though.  I think, I think I gotta do a little Broadway soon.  Really?  Our pal's in a play again.  What play?  Rob Bartlett.  Yeah?  What's he in?  I don't know.  What's he in?  I don't know what it's called.  A regular Broadway star.  How to succeed in business.  He's, he's doing it with the Harry Potter kid, right?  Oh, really?  Is it on yet or are they still rehearsing? 
[00:20:00]  It's on.  Oh, let's go see that.  Yeah, we gotta, we gotta go see Rob Bartlett.  I'm sure, uh, Radcliffe there loves being called the Harry Potter kid.  He's the Harry Potter kid.  Trying to, trying to break out and show his cock in Equus.  And now he's in this.  He loves Broadway.  You think he's, uh.  Dude, he had to show his cock.  You think he's half a fig?  No, I don't think so.  No?  I think he had to show his cock because Harry Potter was so huge.  What do you do after Harry Potter?  You gotta show your cock.  You gotta show your cock.  Yeah.  Put him in a bad spot.  And Hermione's gotta show her bush to get out of that whole Hermione thing. 
[00:20:30]  That's what I think.  Is she looking hot?  Just saying.  Eh, she's alright.  Am I behind in Harry Potter movies?  Did one come out recently that I didn't see?  Yeah.  I've seen him.  It's called Harry Potter Gets a Prostate Exam.  Yeah, they're getting a little old.  See?  Getting the fact that it's been so long that they've been doing this, Jimmy.  That's not a bad one.  Oh.  True, he is getting older.  She got her dykey haircut.  The short hair.  But, uh, let me see.  Eh, there's something. 
[00:21:00]  There's something going on there that ain't too bad.  Right?  Eh, she looks too much like a boy.  Well, she's got the, uh...  Anything wrong with that?  She looks too much like a boy.  Some girls could pull off the short hair and you don't mind, but she looks like a boy, man.  And the other one that's looking way too boyish that they all said looked great at the Oscars  was, uh, Michelle, uh, Williams with the blonde hair real short.  She looked like a fucking boy.  And they're like, look how beautiful she looks. 
[00:21:30]  Only a few people could pull off that short hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh...  What do you think, Ant?  I don't like the short hair on, uh...  On anyone, right?  On the girls.  Yeah, but she has, like, a weird face.  Does she?  Yeah, like, I'm not saying that she's...  She's not ugly, but to me, Emma Watson from, uh, you know, Hermione from, uh, Potter.  Right, right.  I don't know.  Something about her face bugs me.  I don't like it.  Yeah, even when she has long hair, I wasn't really into her so much.  I don't know.  What about, uh...  I think she looks all right.  Show us, uh, Michelle Williams, too.  Yeah, Michelle Williams.  I used to think she was fucking sexy, man. 
[00:22:00]  But then she got the really short hair at the Oscars and blonde.  Was she on the Dawson?  I don't know.  What show was she on?  Um...  I don't even remember.  I'm trying to...  I'll wait.  I'll just wait and see when a name pops up.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  Yeah, she was on Dawson's Creek.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  The Dawson.  Yeah, let me see.  She got short hair there.  She was also on Heath Ledger.  Yeah, her, uh, yeah.  Her, uh, yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Her face don't fit that short hair.  No, man, they said how beautiful she looked.  And it creeped me out, because I'm thinking she looks more like a boy now.  Yeah, everyone that says they're beautiful is either a woman, so they can't really judge  very well.  She's fucking hot, but...  Or a gay guy.  But the short hair is a little rough.  If she grew it out a little bit, then fine, man.  I love those fucking gay guys doing the red carpet shit.  She looks fabulous with this gown that evokes the 30s, and, uh, it's just so beautiful.  And you're like, no.  No. 
[00:23:00]  Just get a guy to go, you can look instantly and just go, nah, nah, she's not really pulling  it off.  Her hair is, uh, dykey, and, uh, the dress not really showing enough.  It's kind of fucked up, and her ass looks stupid in it.  And we're trying to see if we can see the, uh, the panties, or, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, a panty line, or a little camel toe.  Anything.  Or something.  What's that about, you think?  You think the gay guys want to wear that dress?  That's why they're so into it?  No, they're very into the whole fashion thing of it.  But they look, they look beyond, like, what the guy, we can't look that. 
[00:23:30]  It's like, uh, having, uh, infrared vision.  We, we can look to a certain thing with a girl, but they can look past the attractiveness  and wanting to fuck it-ness of a girl, and, uh, see, like, the fashion of it.  Right.  It's like, wow, you really like cock.  You can't see what we're seeing.  I'm trying to delay the Charlie Sheen thing, because we did it in the first hour yesterday.  Oh, I know.  Just to spread it out. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Because it's Charlie Sheen overkill at this point.  Charlie Sheen.  Did you hear about Mike Starr?  Mike Starr.  Lost another one to addiction.  Alice in Chains.  The basis, the original basis of Alice in Chains.  Loodle, loodle, loodle, loodle, loodle, loodle, loodle, loodle, loodle.  He was, yes.  There's some great bass lines in Alice in Chains.  There's very distinct bass lines to open up some songs.  Yeah, it had that heavy, heavy bottom sound on Alice in Chains.  And then he became, um, pretty famous for Celebrity Rehab. 
[00:24:30]  He was out of his fucking mind.  Does that work, uh, well for him, huh?  Season three, I believe, on, uh, Celebrity Rehab.  He was, he was in a bad place.  And then, uh, Dr. Drew brings him back, the last Celebrity Rehab that just ended.  Uh, he, he brings Mike Starr back with a few others to show the current Celebrity Rehab  people, look, these are, these are past clients and look how well they're doing.  And Mike Starr came out and they're like, oh my God.  And he, he had clear eyes and they're all, we're hugging him.  Like, oh wow. 
[00:25:00]  Fast forward a mere few months and, uh, he's dead in a house in Utah.  That's, yeah.  I heard Mike Starr at first.  I thought it was the actor.  A lot of people thought that when I tweeted yesterday.  I'm like, no, I did say from Alice in Chains.  No, I, I forget how I heard it.  I heard it was Mike Starr.  Yeah.  It's some reference to the, the death.  What didn't say who he was.  Here's, uh, really fast.  Dr. Drew introduces Mike as a success story.  This, this was on TV, uh, only a couple months ago.  So do you guys want to say anything? 
[00:25:30]  Start with Mike, anything to the patients?  Um.  About your experience or what it feels like to be out or what it feels like to be in?  Just stick with it.  That's all.  Mike is a different person.  Drew, I can't believe it.  Right?  He's a different person.  He's a different person.  A whole different affect.  Yeah.  Everything.  Yeah.  Different guy.  Different person.  Altogether, different person.  Yeah.  Six months.  Appreciate that.  Yeah.  Six months, seven days, I think.  That's amazing.  Wow.  Wow.  I mean, you're not the guy I met last August either.  He was, right.  You were a wreck in August.  Yeah.  That was after everything.  He struggled a little bit, but he's always stayed with the program, taken recommendations, 
[00:26:00]  come back.  It's rarely a straight line to success, Jason W.  I mean, you're in, you're out, you're in, you're out, and then suddenly you kind of  get some time together, and here he is.  Pretty sad.  Just shows you how bad that addiction is, because Dr. Drew was very happy with where  he was at, Mike Starr.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he's a different person now.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  And then Dr. Drew explains his motivation for having Mike and the others there. 
[00:26:30]  One experience begets another.  My hope is that the stories these alumni have shared here today will be a source of inspiration  for the patients as they prepare for life outside the safety of treatment.  It'll get better.  It'll get better.  These alumni success stories are a shining example that sorority is possible, even for  the most serious of addicts, and that a healthy, flourishing life is ahead.  Is Dr. Drew talking today?  I don't know.  It can't be good for business. 
[00:27:00]  When one of your stars drops.  He's like, see, I don't think people understand.  If he fucks things up, like, people die.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well, it just seems a little, really, very sensitive subject for a reality show.  Starr appeared on the third season of Celebrity Rehab back in 2009, was arrested last month  for felony possession of a controlled substance.  Salt Lake City cops say he had six Xanax pills and six Opana. 
[00:27:30]  It's a painkiller?  Is that how you say that?  I've never seen it.  I've never heard of Opana before.  Anyone?  Anyone?  When he was busted, Starr was 44 years old.  Let's see.  Mike's dad tells TMZ it's a terrible shock and tragedy.  That's ridiculous.  Shock?  Wow.  Because if you know anything about Mike Starr, he used to get high with his own dad.  Yeah.  And there's nothing shocking about this. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And it wasn't overdose.  Huh?  It was an overdose.  And it was an overdose, right?  I guess.  The update is police tell us Starr's body was found in a Salt Lake City home.  Cops say they were called to the house.  It went 42 p.m.  All right.  Have they confirmed it was an overdose?  I haven't heard overdose yet.  I'm more asking.  Oh, I haven't heard that yet.  I don't know.  Yeah, I didn't mean to say that definitively.  It was more like, so it wasn't overdosed?  Yeah.  Who knows?  Well, if the father's saying a tragedy and stuff, you know, it wasn't...  It seems like it wouldn't be a heart attack or anything, right? 
[00:28:30]  It seems like a...  You would have to bet it's an OD situation.  Well, heart attacks can be, you know, like Mike, and sometimes they're surprising, but  they're not.  Right.  You can never be 100% surprised when there's a heart attack, because it can happen to  any person.  You're always a little shocked at the suddenness of it.  I just said something that didn't need to be said.  We all got it.  I said fucking a lot yesterday.  I listened to some of the replay.  I was going to the cellar.  Yeah?  I just heard when I was talking about Mike, I was like, any fucking...  I'm like, what am I doing?  I said I was very overtired, but I hate listening to myself. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, I don't like listening.  Really?  No, every once in a while.  Yeah, occasionally there'll be a bit that I want to hear.  Yeah, yeah.  I crack myself up.  Hopefully you will on the way home.  You just can't get enough of you, huh?  I know.  I listen.  I'm like, this guy's hysterical.  I'm like, ah, throw it out there.  Let it just be out there for people.  Whatever.  If they love it, great.  If they hate it, whatever.  What am I going to do?  Can't change it.  Dude, I was so...  Just listening to myself going, yeah, shut up.  Oh, no. 
[00:29:30]  Because I kept saying fucking, and I knew I was tired.  I was sniffling.  I was like, what are you doing?  You're so super critical of you.  Yeah, but I have ears.  I need a cough button.  Was it because it was tough to talk about Mike yesterday?  No, maybe because it was...  I don't know why.  I just kept saying it.  Talking about Mike DiStefano, obviously.  Yeah, his wakes today.  We were just talking about Mike's star.  The wakes today, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  I just caught myself doing it.  I think part of it was I was bummed, but I was also overtired.  What you said about Mike yesterday was really good, by the way. 
[00:30:00]  I was thinking about that after the show.  You had a nice take on that.  Oh, thanks.  Where, you know, he would have taken that contract 11 years ago if someone said, look, we'll give  you another solid 11 years, because he had a rough, rough life.  Yeah.  Because it's so easy just to go, wow, he went before his time, and it's such a tragedy.  And sometimes, man, you know.  You never know what would have happened if you hadn't.  Like, it's like a lot of times things look shitty, but it's like, let's just say that  you can watch how the movie would have unfolded. 
[00:30:30]  I always look at it like that, or I try to.  And let's say he went the other direction.  He might have been dead three weeks into the 11th.  You know, it's like, right.  It still sucks.  Oh, it blows.  But, I mean, the guy started heroin at 15, got clean, was HIV positive, was in prison.  There was, he was.  There was some positivity in his life.  Oh, boo.  I know.  He's really awful.  I know.  He was on the streets with his brother committing crimes.  So at any moment, he could have fucking died. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, just gotten shot or paralyzed or.  Right.  So many people end up just, you know, it's like most people who just die.  They don't get shots at comedy careers, you know.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Did he do comedy when he was using it?  I don't think he did.  I could be wrong.  I think he did that when he was.  Yeah.  I know he cracked them up in prison to kind of keep his ass clean.  Keep the people away.  Yeah, to keep them away.  Player said that in the 70s.  He said about going to jail.  He said, I make niggers laugh all day to keep their mind off the booty. 
[00:31:30]  Because you don't want to get fucked.  Oh, no, you wouldn't.  That could probably take your sense of humor away real quickly.  Really quickly.  You know how fast all the blues and yellows would become gray with a dick in your ass?  All the pretty colors just turned gray.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be a great folk song?  All the pretty colors turn gray.  And then you realize at the end of the song you start like he's getting fucked in the ass.  Yeah.  That's good.  Hey, learning that Opon is a mix of Oxycontin and morphine. 
[00:32:00]  Oh.  That's a nice combination, huh?  That sounds good if you can't sleep.  If you're tossing and turning, I would think that would probably put you to sleep pretty readily.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah, I know.  Because all I did last night was sit in anticipation of watching the latest Charlie Sheen thing.  I don't care what he says anymore.  I really don't care.  I really am waiting to just push the button and not follow him on Twitter and shit like that. 
[00:32:30]  But I haven't hit that point yet.  I'm not, you know, I'm not texting and tweeting winning and catchphrases.  But I just, I want to see where this is going.  Yeah.  Like, you know.  And he could thank me any time for hooking him up with the fucking TriCaster guy that gave him a great fucking look for the broadcast.  Wait, you're connected to Charlie Sheen now?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The guy that, the guy on Twitter. 
[00:33:00]  Was this a dream?  Or is this real?  No, no, no.  This is real.  This is real.  Because I, I.  It's not an Obama situation where you think you're now friends with Charlie Sheen.  No, I'm not.  Charlie Sheen doesn't know who the fuck I am.  How did this work out?  But the guy that hooked him up with the TriCaster.  That's what you use on your show?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I use.  And I'm always extolling its greatness.  And it was like, hey, get Charlie Sheen to, you know, start using it.  He's using one of these things.  And a bunch of people, you know, I started retweeting him.  And a bunch of people retweeting me and sending Charlie Sheen, like, the fact that his broadcast looks like shit. 
[00:33:30]  And it's got to look good.  And he's got to use this system.  And then, lo and behold, last night, he's using the TriCaster.  And it's, they sent them over, one of the TriCasters.  And he's using it.  It's pretty much a TV studio in a box.  And it's got, it's great for video.  It's good for Ustream, too, bro.  I'm broadcasting.  Oh, yeah.  That'll help everyone on Ustream that.  People becoming aware of it.  Jeez, I can't talk. 
[00:34:00]  It looks great.  It just, everything looks great off of this fucking unit.  And you can see last night's Sheen's Corner, even though he's still babbling.  But at least he was reading and he looked cleaned up.  It looked like he was wearing some makeup.  Maybe some lighting was on him.  And he's just sitting there.  And it wasn't a shaky Blair Witch camera.  It looked really good.  I mean, the look of the video and everything was really good.  Good camera, you could tell.  And, yeah.  I don't know.  I think I'm going to get a nice control panel out of it, though. 
[00:34:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, nice.  A little plug-over.  No problem with that.  Yeah, whatever, you know?  Hey, do you think that, it's funny.  I thought of you guys when he was saying just how David Lee Rothman did.  But he's going, I don't need any guests.  I got me.  And I said, you know how fast you're going to need guests?  Oh, boy.  This guy, Charles Sheen's going to go down quick.  He's a famous guy to begin with.  But as far as this fame arc, he is going to drop fast.  So I hope he makes his money in the next couple weeks.  Couple weeks, that's it. 
[00:35:00]  Last night was very scripted.  It was completely scripted.  I saw his eyes moving back and forth.  Yeah, yeah.  He was reading.  Obviously, he was doing a lot of reading.  He was reading either a teleprompter or cue cards or something.  And it looked great.  It looked good.  And he, now for somebody that's like, he doesn't care what the trolls are doing or saying or  this, that, and the other thing, he sure reacts to everything that's said about him.  Because people said he looked like utter shit in the previous video.  His hair was wild. 
[00:35:30]  He was making faces.  He was crazy, Charlie Sheen.  Now, the first one was talk show Charlie Sheen with his hipster hat and his people.  Glasses, his hipster glasses.  And he's just like, you know, off the cuff kind of thing.  Failed miserably.  Looked like Joe Rogan's podcast without the talent.  Right.  Without the interesting dialogue.  With his friends and everyone's looking good.  Just kind of, you know.  Confident.  Yeah, yeah.  But that didn't work.  No.  People said they wanted the crazy Charlie.  So, the next one was crazy insane Charlie. 
[00:36:00]  Blair Witch, cheesy video camera, shaking, looking like a nut, looking pale gaunt, they  said.  And he reacted to that.  And he got professional broadcast equipment and was sitting at the desk.  A nice close-up just on him at the desk with the background.  There was some subtle lighting on him.  He was wearing makeup.  He had some facial makeup on to kind of make a, put some color in his face.  I like to put some color in his face. 
[00:36:30]  King of Comet.  Very good.  And he was wearing his glasses.  His hair was, you know, greased but in place a la Charlie Sheen.  And he was talking about things that people want to hear.  His bosses.  He was talking about his bosses, two and a half men.  Talking about his co-star.  Talking about, you know, whatever.  Talking about him and being, like, really nasty.  Using names that were very similar to the names of the real people.  So, maybe he would stay out of trouble. 
[00:37:00]  Les Goon.  He went after, um...  Oh, yeah.  He went after Les.  He went after Les Moves?  We got fired now.  Pretty much calling him impotent and saying that his wife has a parade of, like, gardeners  waiting to have sex with her in front of the house.  Oh, my God.  What an idiot.  He went off like a lunatic to everybody that was involved with two and a half men.  Man, what an idiot.  But, you know what?  At least it was a little more interesting than him just rambling. 
[00:37:30]  Because it was done in Charlie Sheen fashion, but it was written out.  You could tell it was very calculated and written out, and he was reading it.  And he was the actor Charlie Sheen last night.  We weren't seeing a guy that was trying to just go, hey, look, I'm out of control.  He was using the cigarette as a prop and leaning into the camera and talking with his hands  and doing that Charlie Sheen actor guy that you're like, oh, this is the guy from Platoon  and this is the guy from Two and a Half Men and Wall Street. 
[00:38:00]  You know, this is the guy who's acting.  Do you think, though, when people try to protect it that much, everybody would know you meant Les Moonves?  That doesn't shield you.  It's not going to shield you.  Like, if you go on and you say, uh, Dumbner Medstone, everyone knows who you meet.  Right.  God.  Yes.  That doesn't shield you from libel laws.  Or whatever slander.  And you know what?  We, I hate to, but we have experience, so I apologize because some people get frustrated 
[00:38:30]  when we make it about ourselves, but we do have experience in this.  And when we took on people, when we got fired or this and that, you knew how high to hit.  Right.  There was a level of management that you never touched because you wanted to work again.  And going after Les Moonves means Les will never hire him.  Yeah.  And the problem is those guys are all a little fraternity, man.  Yeah.  Even though they compete with each other, they're kind of a fraternity.  And they don't want to.  And it gets around.  It's like, well, if you're going, if you're saying that about Les Moonves because it went  bad, you're going to say that about us if it goes bad with us if we hire you. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  So fuck you.  They don't want that.  It's not worth it.  They don't want that.  That's why we always fucking hit just below those guys always.  Well, there is a guy here.  I'll just call him Steve Kidney.  Let's call him that.  You know, sometimes things happen.  Steve Urethra.  You know.  Like, did we ever go after Mel?  Rob X.  Did we ever go after Mel then? 
[00:39:30]  No.  That's what I'm talking about.  It's crazy.  And guess what?  And it was smart not to because he's hired us twice since then.  We went after Fell Harmesen, but never Mel.  You got to know, you know, which guys to leave alone if you want to work again.  And this was a real reason to go after them.  And it was like, what did you want Les to do?  No.  What did Charlie expect?  Right.  And Les made a move, if you believe what Charlie said.  Charlie said it where Les came to his kitchen and said, look, we know what you're about. 
[00:40:00]  We understand that to a point, but you got to back off a little.  I don't know what the exact words were, but they said reel it in a little.  You know, you're making everyone crazy.  Reel it in a little, please.  Yeah.  So even Les was willing to work with the crazy Charlie Sheen.  Sorry, but continue.  No, no, I was saying, so we didn't really get the crazy Charlie Sheen.  We got the Charlie Sheen that thought he was being eloquent and giving out some Charlie Sheen-isms  as he rambled about his bosses, ex-bosses.  And another thing he had was he had a little lav mic on his collar, so the sound was very good. 
[00:40:30]  He had a little roll, start the show with Charlie Sheen kind of a song going and some movie clips  from Apocalypse and some of his movies and some news footage.  So he started with that, a nice graphic splash.  So he was making it look a little more polished, a little more polished. 
[00:41:00]  I must say, like a certain show you might see from Anthony's basement.  Jealous?  Ah, no, because mine still looks...  He's doing your act.  You know that, right?  Mine looks fantastically better.  He's doing the crazy guy act.  Crazy guy, yelling guy?  You're jealous.  I could see it.  I yell a lot!  And you give the impression you might be a little nuts.  Might be a little nuts.  When you're doing your podcast.  Exactly.  Because I'm home.  I'm comfortable.  I'm just there.  He's taking your act.  Whatever.  I think he's taking my act.  I invented the podcast.  If he does gun karaoke, then you know he's ripping you off.  Then it's over. 
[00:41:30]  Then it is over.  Then it's on, right?  But it was just him.  And he's doing only like 10 minutes.  10 minutes, he's out.  Because that's all he's got.  Yeah.  That's all he's got.  It's not easy to do.  Yeah.  Can I tell the guys down the hall?  Huh?  We have to get a visual element to the Opie and Anthony show immediately.  Because, you know, the days are flying by.  And that's what is happening out there. 
[00:42:00]  Like, the people listening to our voices right now, they're also watching a lot of podcasts now.  They're watching Joe Rogan on a regular basis and others.  Does Bill and those guys do audio only?  I've never seen it.  Are they a visual podcast, too?  I'm not really sure.  To be honest.  Yeah.  I think that's just audio.  Marin's is just audio.  But you're right.  A lot of them are audio.  But they're all moving to a visual element.  And as the weeks and the months go by, it's going to make this show seem out of date.  Yeah.  Out of place.  We have to get on it now. 
[00:42:30]  Mark my word.  This is where the whole business is heading.  Where it's podcasts, where you see and, well, obviously you hear it.  You know.  Just listening to audio is not good enough for people.  Maybe now it is.  But in the very near future, it's not going to be good enough.  I'm telling you.  I know.  And they want them looking better than just a webcam these days.  It's kind of, you know, you can do that and everything.  But it doesn't give you the opportunity to really use that visual element like that.  People expect a visual element now. 
[00:43:00]  More and more.  When I'm wandering around with podcasts, you know, just fooling around.  If I go to Ustream and I want to check, whatever.  Yeah.  If they don't have a visual element, I don't care.  Yeah.  You're kind of like, I want to see now.  I want to see what they're doing.  I want to see as well.  Yeah.  And it's happening everywhere except for this place, of course.  And we had the visual element a few years back.  And they took it away from us because it didn't make sense to them.  We had, what, really nice cameras?  Three or four really nice cameras set up.  You forget.  Yeah, there were more than that.  Oh, how many did we have?  I think it was like six. 
[00:43:30]  Was it?  Six cameras shoot going on.  And it wasn't just shitty webcams.  They were really nice cameras for the time.  I'm sure they're outdated now.  You know how you realize times have changed?  I was watching this police video released on 9-11 from the helicopter.  And it was a videotape.  Oh, the tracking?  But it's amazing how even on, like, when you look at 10 years ago, the video now, I was  like, nobody had HD flips back then.  It was all video cameras.  No.  Yeah.  That even looks kind of primitive now.  It was on tape.  And that's only 10 years ago.  Only 10 years ago.  Yeah.  I chose not to watch that video.  I don't know why. 
[00:44:00]  It just bothered me.  And I get that same fucking sick feeling watching it.  I know it went viral this week.  I just couldn't fucking do it.  I watched it.  I got, and I did.  I got, like, that sick, ugh, oh, God.  All, like, just, ugh, depressing fucking, I can't watch it.  Yeah.  I chose not to.  I know how this is going to end.  I'm sure I will watch it, but I didn't think there was much new stuff in it.  It was interesting just to watch from the angle.  A different angle, huh?  The close shot of the roof was creepy. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Like, that's, like, just the big antenna, the smoke just pouring over the top of the roof.  They showed people on the roof?  And just no one where it's going to happen.  No, there was no one on the roof.  They couldn't get up there.  They couldn't get up.  Yeah, they couldn't get up to the roof.  I thought the guys were getting on the roof to hope that a helicopter would pluck a few.  No, I imagine they would have tried if they could have.  If there was people on the roof, I think they would have tried.  Maybe there were, but there wasn't any video of them.  I never saw.  I heard the doors were locked going up.  There was so much smoke up there.  All those people who were trapped would have tried to get up to the roof to just get  the air, you know, the fresh air. 
[00:45:00]  And smoke was just blowing over the top of the roof.  That probably wouldn't have helped that much.  No.  Yeah, it was kind of just like, oh, God, depressing to watch.  Yeah, there's the shot of the roof, just the smoke billowing over it.  And you just know it's going to fall, so you're like, ah, I don't want to watch this shit.  Now you do watch it.  No, now you do watch it.  Well, now you do, right.  So it's like...  But at the time, you're like, there's no way they're going to...  No.  It's going to be a horrible fire.  A lot of people are going to die, but you never thought they actually would come out.  And they're like, oh, partial collapse.  Some floors have fallen. 
[00:45:30]  And they didn't realize.  It's like, no, that building is gone.  Yeah, wait till the smoke clears, right?  Because of the thermite.  You still thought there was a building behind the smoke.  Yeah, yeah.  And then the smoke started clearing.  You're like, wait a minute.  Oh, my God.  That's gone.  I'll watch this later.  I'll have to check it out.  It's just...  You got to check it out, right?  Oh, shit.  Fuck it.  And then you just watch that, and then you hear about the Muslims getting all angry at  Peter King that he wants to start some hearings on radical Islam and its effect on this country 
[00:46:00]  and terrorism, and the Islamic community is all up in arms about, you know, oh, it's a witch hunt.  Go fuck yourself.  It's affecting it.  Every time there's a terrorist fucking plot in the world, it seems, it's Islamic.  So believe me, it's a credible investigation. 
[00:46:30]  And it's not a witch hunt.  It's like, why can't Muslims, and maybe some do, for once, stand with the rest of us and  not think of how it's going to affect their image?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you know, this will just make all Muslims look bad and more prejudiced.  And they go, and in a veiled threat, thinly veiled threat, it's like, this is just going  to make more terrorism because it's going to make, it's going to alienate Muslims.  And oh, is that what happens when Muslims feel alienated?  Yeah, they blow you up.  They pick up fucking bombs and guns and shit. 
[00:47:00]  You're proving the point, dummy, that this radical Islam has to be looked into.  And I love when they go, it's not just Islam.  Oh, you're going to bring up McVeigh, are you?  How many fucking years ago was that?  And he was executed.  Yeah.  And believe me, yeah, he was taken care of.  He was executed.  When's the last time an Islamic radical was executed in this country?  Let's fucking execute some Islamic radicals.  Ah, I'm fucking tired of it.  But it annoys you, just thinking of themselves, of course, how it's going to affect them. 
[00:47:30]  And it's, why don't you help?  Yeah.  Why don't you realize that if we, if you have to look, and Peter King said what I've said  a hundred times, and I definitely think he stole it from me because he's a big fan.  Yes.  In my mind.  He is.  When you're going for the mafia, you look at Italians.  When you want the Westies, you go for the Irish.  When you're looking for Islamic radicals, you go to the fucking Muslim.  What, what's the, what is the issue?  The Russian mafia.  You don't.  Where do you go?  You go to Spain.  You don't be polite and try to, to, to look at the Irish or the Jews or. 
[00:48:00]  No.  You don't look at gays when you're going after the Russian mob.  You go to fucking, you know, Brooklyn and you go after the Russian mob with the Russians.  It's the American PC mentality that slips in.  You don't see fucking Israel doing that.  Thank God the Germans and even the British have gotten a little fed up with this shit.  And now dummies that we are are finally, it's finally, oh, 10 years later, we should look  to the Muslim community for radical Islamic people.  Okay.  There was a shooting in Germany just a few days ago.  They had enough.  And that was, that wasn't, uh, Islamic fucking asshole tied of it. 
[00:48:30]  And I started getting like, uh, a few tweets from some guy that was like, Peter King is,  uh, a terrorist, uh, supporting the IRA years ago.  It's like, you know something, shut the fuck up.  I, I, I, I, I'm not, I'm not even going to put that in the same category.  Stop.  People trying to kick England out of their fucking, uh, you know, out of their country. 
[00:49:00]  And, uh, yeah, they use terrorist tactics, bombs, shit like that.  A lot of innocent people were killed.  Yeah, sure.  But, uh, you know what?  It ain't in my fucking house.  And now it is.  And it's Islam.  So, deal with it.  Fucking hate that shit.  God bless Nick DiPaolo.  God damn.  Some of his tweets are great about that.  Really?  Him and Gutfeld, too.  Greg Gutfeld, uh, was tweeting some good stuff. 
[00:49:30]  It's just fucking, people are still oversensitive in this country.  We just, we just have to stop trying to be polite.  Polite, yes.  Peter King just, and you're punished here for, like, Helen Thomas, this 90-year-old woman who worked  in the white, flaming left-wing liberal.  Flaming.  And I didn't agree with her views, but somebody asked her on video what she thought of Israel  and the Palestinians, and she thinks Israel should get out, and she was against it, and  she said she was, she was fired, or she had to leave her post.  And her speaker dropped, the fucking vulture scumbag agent that represented her, dropped 
[00:50:00]  her, because she gave an impolite answer.  And it's like, someone asked her.  Yeah, they asked.  She broke all these boundaries for women, and she was sitting, she was asking the first  question in the White House, she, with Kennedy on, and she has to fucking leave because she  gives an unpopular answer when asked something.  But the last six presidents were annoyed they had to go to her first.  Oh, they hated her.  Oh, my God.  They really did.  Oh, come on, really?  We got to go to the woman in the red dress because it's tradition.  They hated that monster.  Get it.  They hated that tradition.  Enough already. 
[00:50:30]  But you're right.  I mean, she shouldn't have been fired for giving her opinion.  She'd never be fired for giving your opinion, especially if you work in the media.  Yeah, when you're asked by the media.  When you're asked, right.  You know.  And if you don't answer properly.  You don't answer properly, you're out.  You're out?  That's hysterical.  That's crazy.  That's what happened to Jimmy the Greek, too.  I mean, you know, Jimmy's viewpoint was a little odd.  A little crazy.  But, you know, I'm sure some of it was based in fact, regardless of how many people want  to hear it or not.  But when the cameras are rolling and you ask people these things and then you report it 
[00:51:00]  and then the person is fired for his ideas and beliefs and shit, it's amazing.  All right.  We should take our first break.  Charlie Sheen.  So we got episode four, a couple highlights.  I couldn't be bothered.  You'll hear a more controlled Charlie.  Yeah.  A not as crazy yet.  Still catchphrase-y and trying to be poetic as he's just slamming his ex-bosses.  Okay. 
[00:51:30]  So we'll do some Sheen next.  And we got to talk about Ticky Barber.  The hell's he doing?  You know what he's doing and you're an expert on this shit.  That's stupid.  We'll get your take.  I know what this is about.  I'll tell you next.  It's very obvious.  Okay.  And other things.  Oh, we got to talk about Camden too.  Yeah.  We got an update on Camden.  Oh, yeah.  Congrats.  Remember they got rid of their whole police force or half their police force?  Yes.  And remember to talk about the photo that I saw.  Maybe you guys mentioned that already of crime in Camden.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I saw that one.  I tweeted about that.  Okay.  Yeah.  We'll talk about Camden. 
[00:52:00]  If you don't know where it is, just Google it during the break and have fun reading about  Camden.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  We'll be right back. 
[00:52:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:53:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:53:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:54:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:54:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:55:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:55:30]  He's dead.  Original basis of Alice in Chains.  How great is that?  We were discussing if that's dated or not.  We don't know.  We're too close to it because I still love Alice in Chains just as much as I did when I first heard them.  I still put Alice in Chains on and I still put Alice in Chains on and I don't know if it feels dated or not. 
[00:56:00]  I'm told all the time, you know, your musical taste just fucking stopped in the 90s and this.  It's like, you know what, not really it didn't.  I still like some music and shit, but I just can't take the faggotness that is being passed off as rock.  It just sucks.  It's not really a rock genre anymore, is there?  Faggotness, no.  And don't tell me, here's a good band and this one's good and you just don't know where to look. 
[00:56:30]  You've got to look at the fucking indie under the college radar thing and it's like, you know what, then they're not, I'm talking about mainstream rock.  Because modern rock is so good now that there's not even a station to listen to it in New York City.  Right.  That's how good modern rock is these days.  It wouldn't be a station.  Oh, Jimmy, there would not.  So what do you listen to?  You've never given us a band or a song. 
[00:57:00]  That I listen to what, now?  Like, I'll throw, I like MGMT and I do like Muse, some of their songs.  Yeah, I can't take it.  There's two bands anyway.  That whole affected fucking singer thing and the...  Silver Sun pickups I like.  Just the fucking...  It looks like I just woke up hairdo, but it's every fucking little out of place hair is in its place.  That shit to me is just like, fuck.  No, faggots.  It's still just like, ugh. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  What do you like, then?  Emo.  You say you like new stuff.  Is it more pop?  I couldn't even tell you.  Like, when I hear it, I go, oh, that's cool.  I don't know who it is, but...  You listen to All Nation on the way home?  That's good.  Yeah, occasionally.  I'm more, you know, talk radio guy.  What about the new Foo Fighters?  News, thing like that.  I haven't heard the new Foo Fighters.  New Foo Fighters.  I'm embarrassed to say.  The problem with All Nation is, you know, you go away for six months, you go back, they're playing the same fucking songs. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  I don't know what they could do differently, because I guess they, you know, you need a list of songs to play, but I don't know, man.  I can't find anything.  I just can't find anything that doesn't sound so gay.  This new Foo Fighters song is actually really good.  Oh, okay.  It's called White Limo.  The video's pretty sweet, too.  It's got Lemmy.  Oh, it does?  Yeah.  They're just riding around the limo.  Lemmy.  It's the best video ever.  Is it? 
[00:58:30]  Does that have him driving?  Lemmy's the limo driver.  That rule is...  There's Lemmy.  Lemmy.  Lemmy.  The sugar pops on his face are getting bigger.  Yeah.  Oh, it's in the video. 
[00:59:00]  Lemmy's drinking and driving.  Runs over the rollerblader.  Ha, ha.  Let me love, like, Nazi memorabilia.  You can tell that's as close to Nazi boots as anyone could get without saying, hey, those 
[00:59:30]  are Nazi boots.  This is good.  This is the Foo Fighters, huh?  Wow.  Sounds like Queens of the Stone Age.  I think Dave Grohl had something to do with that band.  I can't remember what his influence was there.  He was actually drumming.  He could drum on the first album.  Drumming on the video on the first album. 
[01:00:00]  Oh.  That's Dave Grohl?  I think Dave Grohl's the best songwriter of the last ten years.  He's put out some hits that aren't, like, they've been considered rock, you know?  He's very consistent, and, you know, I really would love to know how much influence he really 
[01:00:30]  had in making Nirvana.  I mean, obviously, he was a part of the band, but, I mean, I think he was a lot more than  a lot of people give him credit for.  More than Chris Novosile.  Is he singing this?  Yeah.  Dave Grohl.  Oh, yeah.  He's screaming this.  I mean, Jimmy, the first Foo Fighter album, he didn't have a band.  That was Dave Grohl playing every instrument and everything.  Everything was him on his first album.  Yeah.  And then he had to get a band to support the album. 
[01:01:00]  That's a talented guy.  Did he sing in Queens of the Stone Age?  I don't think he sang in it.  No?  Grohl singing in Queens of the Stone Age?  No, he just didn't drum.  That's a cool sound.  I like this a lot.  This isn't even the single, like, off the new record.  They just made this.  And I'm not even sure it's going to be on the album.  His screamy face is hysterical. 
[01:01:30]  It's like a wolf, man.  Let me drink it and drive it.  You'd never see that anymore.  Awesome.  Some stock footage of a car going over.  It was like a red sports car.  It was a red sports car.  It wasn't even the limo.  That's all right.  That's great.  What message is that going to send, though?  I know.  The children.  I thought it was like, let me should drive for you.  I'm downloading that right now. 
[01:02:00]  That's awesome.  White limo.  Foo Fighters.  That's a good one.  Sounds like a number one hit tune.  Number one hit tune.  All right.  Well, I reckon.  Why don't we get into Sheen's Corner, episode four?  Yeah, yeah.  So we had watched.  It looked a lot better, like you said.  Visually, really good.  And he has you to thank because...  One of my pals over there at New Tech, that put out the TriCaster, it was his goal to get 
[01:02:30]  Charlie Sheen to use the TriCaster.  So we relentlessly pounded him about it.  I've been just saying the best things about New Tech and the TriCaster.  They're great.  And I own one.  I bought it myself.  I didn't get it for free.  So, you know, fuck you that think I'm doing this for any kind of favors.  Language.  Ah, yes.  I use it.  The foul language.  But it's great.  It is fucking great, man.  Well, your quality is so good. 
[01:03:00]  I mean, visually on your thing is excellent, man.  Yeah, that's what I want.  I want it to look great and to have the shittiest fucking unprofessionalism going on.  Well, can I say home run?  Exactly.  I'm hitting the sauce.  The whole time.  Last night, I was, you know, it's fun to work with and shit.  Last night, I'm able to watch TV and I got my laptop with me and I'm just making little  kind of little visual production pieces to throw in in between shit. 
[01:03:30]  And you don't have to concentrate that much because, you know, once you know the programs,  you could watch a TV show and just kind of click, click, click and push it in and then  drop them in visually.  It gives you that whole visual and you're able to move things around, put graphics behind  you on these virtual TVs that like just look exactly like the news.  So you could when you're doing parodies of the news and goofing on it, it looks like the  news.  Right.  So it's kind of fun to fucking fuck with.  I like it.  Once again, we got to look into a visual element for the show. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  We're going to start looking out of place here in this new world of media.  New world.  So this is official to the guys down the hall.  Look into it, please.  Thank you.  Sheen's Corner, episode four.  We got a couple highlights for everybody.  A couple highlights.  He ripped on his bosses.  He was doing that, you know, profound, poetic, evil Charlie Sheen, but very organized this  time.  How many different versions of Charlie Sheen have we seen now? 
[01:04:30]  Because you said this is actor Charlie Sheen.  This is the actor Charlie Sheen.  Every time he's done one of his shows, his Sheen's Corner shows, he's been a different  Sheen.  The first one, he was trying to do a kind of a Howard Stern show.  A lot of people, he's, you know, doing that kind of thing.  And then the second one was it was crazy, insane Charlie with his hair messy.  And that's the one that they're using to pull all the pictures from.  Which is acting Charlie Sheen.  That's acting, too.  But this one was Charlie Sheen, the actor, the actor, really acting, using his hands, 
[01:05:00]  using his cigarette as a prop, doing those dramatic pauses, looking up into the camera.  Like you could tell he was using his acting chops in this one because it looked good.  It was very professional looking.  Now that I have your lazy fucking intention, world, sit back and rejoice for the Malibu  Messiah, the condor of Calabasas, the fucking warlock of your jealous face sits before you.  Undigested.  I'm embarrassed.  Yeah.  I saw Jimmy's face.  I had to stop. 
[01:05:30]  I'm embarrassed.  It's embarrassing.  This continues with what we said yesterday.  It's embarrassing with him trying to come up with a catchphrase every five minutes.  Oh, well.  He's now the Malibu Messiah.  Malibu Messiah.  Did that trend?  Malibu Messiah.  Was that a successful catchphrase or did that fail miserably, too?  Less and less every day.  Really?  Less and less hashtags that are trending every day.  She's starting to remind me of Chris Jericho in WCW.  He really is.  He sounds like Jericho rocking the mic. 
[01:06:00]  I mean, it's going to date me a little bit, I guess.  But when Jericho was feuding with Goldberg and he was always just like he was being a  dick, but on purpose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it's just that's what he's doing.  Well, we also said yesterday.  It's the Fonzie thing.  I'm waiting for Charlie Sheen to crack some skulls.  Yeah.  He's threatening everybody.  A lot of threats.  Let's see something.  A lot of threats.  Now that I have your lazy fucking intention, world, sit back and rejoice.  For the Malibu Messiah, the condor of Calabasas, the fucking warlock of your jealous face sits  before you.  Undigested hummus trading real estate for this fire dance. 
[01:06:30]  What?  Undigested hummus trading real estate for this fire dance.  You're not smart enough to understand it.  I can't.  Sorry.  He's right.  I can't wrap my mind around it.  That's a profound way to look at the world.  Yes.  Yes.  It's only Sheen can understand.  Sounded like Jim Morrison.  Yeah.  We might need some fucking Doors music behind this.  Very deep.  Man.  That was like a Jim Morrison thing.  You're trying to sound deep, but he didn't even know what he was fucking right. 
[01:07:00]  Hummus into undigested.  What?  What?  Yeah.  Huh?  Do you know what that equals?  Huh?  I blew a $2 million a week job.  No way around it, right?  I don't care how many things you...  This is the Warlock of Wizard.  The Hat of Tourette.  This is the guy who blew a $2 million a week job.  Do you understand?  That means that there was only eight episodes left. 
[01:07:30]  Even if you left in...  That's $16 million more dollars worth of blowjobs.  That he's not getting.  That's a lot.  And he's going to brag that his t-shirt business is doing well and his tiger blood business.  Whatever fucking thing he does.  It's not going to equal what he had.  No, it's a Reggie bar.  What he was going to make.  No.  Right.  Reggie bars were great for a month and no one cared about it.  Now he has to sell t-shirts hoping to get some of that money back.  Great.  How is he winning?  Somebody explain this to me.  Winning.  I beg you all to stay glued to this raven-wise Gibson shredding napalm poet before you. 
[01:08:00]  Alone and unshackled as the desperate cries of the soon-  I'm stopping every time Jimmy gives that look.  I have to.  Jimmy just put his head in his hand looking down and there was definitely reason for that.  It's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  And you said this is the actor, Charlie Sheen?  We have to call it the Jim Morrison, Charlie Sheen.  Yeah?  You think this is the Jim Morrison?  This is Charlie Morrison right here. 
[01:08:30]  An American poet?  Yes.  He's an American poet.  Thank God because it's been way too long.  We need a new American poet.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  What Charlie needs to do is stop looking for an angle.  He's Edgar Allen Schmo.  He's a fool.  He really is.  Just get on and talk, man.  Yeah.  But you know, it's almost like how many times can he pound this thing?  Like, we know he's pissed off.  I don't.  All right, fine.  But stop looking for the next.  Yeah.  Stop looking for the magic. 
[01:09:00]  I want to go back because there's some deep, deep poetry happening here, Jimmy.  Take glue to this raven-wise, Gibson-shredding napalm poet before you, alone and unshackled,  as the desperate cries of the soon forgotten echo freely in my lair, directing your gaze  to their silly and sad, legless and dying heartbeats.  Beware, I told all, yet beware clearly.  Jim Borison.  Canned slabs of jaundiced gorilla pelts.  Good one.  Fill the plates of those fools and clowns and nabobs. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, how they once begged to attend my perfect banquet in the nude.  Now they just beg for the keys to my gold.  Oh.  I'm embarrassed.  Stop trying to be Colonel Kurtz, like when he was reading poetry.  Ah, yes.  You blew a $2 million a week job.  Maya Angelou.  I knew where you were going with that one, Danny.  I saw that before Danny even typed it out. 
[01:10:00]  It's too bad we don't know exactly where he was going.  It's too bad we don't know poets or poetry, because this could really be fun.  Fuck, I don't know any of these fucking people.  I had to Google famous poets.  And I don't even recognize a name in there.  Holy shit.  He's embarrassing.  He's a fool.  So that's how he started it.  Walt Whitless.  There you go.  That's a good one.  Yeah, that's how he started, man. 
[01:10:30]  Hunter S. Dumpson.  He's the Malibu Messiah.  Malibu Messiah.  All right.  The Malibu Messiah.  Sheen starts his unwanted guest list.  Yes.  Yes.  This is where he starts railing.  I'm corporate, man.  Here is my unwanted guest list.  The names slightly altered to keep their stench from polluting my magic daiquiri.  Or even worse, stealing my favorite pony. 
[01:11:00]  A pony named Steve.  His orange mane painted blue.  Blue like the evening sky.  Yes.  As he gallops into their basement to acquire the ancient flatware.  And a rotting cheese board covered in the mold of their moral dysentery.  But of course, a serving tray for the pungent snacks they must now choke down.  Again, the unwanted guest list.  Number one.  Less than Goon Vess.  Part scoundrel.  Part...  What a pussy.  He doesn't want to name him by name, huh?  Less than Goon Vess. 
[01:11:30]  What?  Where's the brave Charlie Sheen?  Well, he's, uh...  This is how he's winning.  I have no idea.  He's winning by, uh, changing their names, because he certainly doesn't want them to come  after him.  Well, of course not.  What a fucking pussy.  You're telling everyone how brave you are.  You're the Malibu Messiah.  Yeah.  Less than Goon Vess.  Part scoundrel.  Part...  My hair to the side.  Screw less, I proclaimed.  Or better yet, screw more.  You gave me your words, so in turn you gave me nothing. 
[01:12:00]  It must really suck being your missus.  The promise of getting something, yet receiving nothing.  In vitro side, all shiny pool boys rejoice.  And line the block around your house.  Sizzle.  Losing.  Bye.  That's his name for this.  Peter Roth.  Sizzle.  Losing.  Bye.  I will not call sloth.  I spare you this revelatory maelstrom of pure exposure, as your heart was always rooted  in fairness and hug-bonding good tidings.  Trust not your evil overlords. 
[01:12:30]  They will discard you, and then abandon your precious family.  Liars and fools.  All of them.  Get out while you can, good sir.  Sheen's Corner could use the bright and sterling presence you led with from day one.  You have my digits.  Use them.  Show your courage, Peter.  Come dance in my gold.  You're trying so fucking hard.  Disgusted Jimmy is just, I'm loving it.  Because he's, I like the guy, and I backed him, because I don't care what he does in his 
[01:13:00]  personal life, and I like the fact that he was telling the truth and just being belligerent  about what he liked, but you fucking admit what happened.  Ah, yes.  He sounds like a seashell slither along silent seafloor.  That's Colonel Kurtz, or whatever it was.  I saw a snail slithering on the edge of a straight razor, and he also blew a $2 million a week job.  I overplayed my hand, as someone in cards will do.  I thought I had blackjack, but apparently I didn't. 
[01:13:30]  I had 16.  And now I want to come off like I meant to have 16 all along.  Right.  But I really didn't, because I thought I had blackjack, but I had 16.  I'm angry that John Cryer didn't call me and come rushing to my defense while I was screaming  and begging for attention, having been raised in show business, and never really having had  to work very hard my entire life.  Hit me.  Five, please.  Five, please.  Blackjack.  Oh, bust.  And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt 
[01:14:00]  to poison and destroy my brothers.  I don't need any guess.  I have me.  That's been interesting for exactly one minute and 48 seconds.  The other 58 minutes, you're on your own.  Let's continue with the unwanted guess list.  Number three, Bruce.  Bruce, Daisy and Wilt.  Shame on you, you much shorter than average fool.  And shame on your invalid attempts to shell game this grand magician. 
[01:14:30]  My crew now knows the truth.  And yes, that is all of their fists pounding on your paper-thin chamber door.  They now lead with solid proof of your sordid hypocrisy and yellow-spined tactics.  Wait.  Is that an angry mob right in your muck hole?  It's over, tiny man.  Grab ankles and accept your fate.  Wow.  Must really suck being you right now.  The pulp of fiction suits you well.  What?  Since childhood short, weak, thick glasses.  Never seen by a goddess. 
[01:15:00]  Only owned by the bully.  Like a bitch.  Sizzle.  Sizzle losing, bye.  Sizzle losing, bye.  Charlie Morrison.  Sizzle losing, bye.  Thank you, Charlie Morrison.  That bye thing.  Bye.  It was cool at first.  I thought from the moment I heard it was a snotty child thing to say.  Duh.  Bye, duh.  Yeah.  No, and it's not charming to me to rush back to the 80s in terminology.  It's not unique and charming.  It's just silly. 
[01:15:30]  Blue Sniffer writes on Twitter, Sheen sounds like someone writing a high school graduation  speech.  That's pretty good.  Sheen gets to Chuck Lorre, or Lorre, or Lorre.  Chuck Lorre, I think it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's, uh...  I wouldn't know because no one's ever put me on a network show.  I have to guess at the big players' names.  Going after the guy that has four hit shows on TV right now.  Number four.  Figure it out.  Hiya, Chuck E. Cheese Ball. 
[01:16:00]  Where you hiding, silly clown?  Behind your narcissism?  Your greed?  Your hatred of yourself?  Or women?  Which personality are you cowering beneath for transparent cover?  I see you, you little worm.  I see you, behind your plastic smile, your bitchy pout, and your desperate need to be  liked.  Forget love.  That ship sailed when you were born.  He is one of your stupid and unfunny jokes. 
[01:16:30]  Good luck with those tin cans, shit brain, and the mush mouth of some pathetic carcass you  so arrogantly attempted to trade out for this warlock.  Think of me often, loser.  Is that a warlock?  You're not a warlock.  Warlocks...  They're magical.  He's not a warlock.  Warlocks are magical.  Actually, yes, he is.  I thought he was a warlock.  He took $2 million a week and made it disappear.  He's making it sound like this guy has nothing without Charlie.  He still has, what, three shows on TV? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, I think he'll be fine.  How I Met Your Mother is doing really well.  Big Bang Theory is doing really well.  And what's the third one?  I think he'll be fine.  What was the other one?  Mike and Molly.  Mike and Molly, I don't know much about.  It's new, but it's doing all right.  He's a comedian, big fat guy from Pittsburgh.  Okay.  I saw him on the Kevin Smith set.  Zach Amiri is a really nice guy, man.  Billy Gardell.  Happy for him, Jimmy.  Very.  Yeah.  He's one of those guys, been at it for fucking years, and he's a veteran.  So it's always good to see a guy like that getting what he worked for.  But you're crying inside?  Nah, because it's not... 
[01:17:30]  Certain times you do, but that's not a role I would...  You know what I mean?  Like him and Molly, it's just about a big fat couple, and I would never have been in that position.  Yeah, you wouldn't do that.  And I'd rather see a guy who's a fucking road veteran, who knows how to be a...  You know what I mean?  Like those guys, you're happy because they encourage you.  Like, hey man, it's not just some fucking 21-year-old with a good jawline and Adam's apple.  It's, you know, it's encouraging.  All right, let's get back to the Warlock.  Hey, Warlock, why don't you come into the squared circle, and we'll decide this thing. 
[01:18:00]  It just does sound like bad fucking mic drivel.  Arrogantly attempted to trade out for this Warlock.  Think of me often, loser, during your most quiet moments.  All alone in the world, staring into the mirror, your least favorite activity.  Think of me as you pray to the silly god of AA,  while begging refuge from the contaminated image of hatred and dismay 
[01:18:30]  that so painfully glares back.  Can you smell your soul?  Can you smell the rotting dog shit?  The fermented puke that is your viscera?  Can you smell the lies?  Can you smell the carnage you've created?  Can you smell the imposter living within?  Can you smell the whimpering, scared child you'll never have the courage to embrace?  Can you smell your mother's tears from some distant memory  as she stared at her pathetic creation, asking all around her 
[01:19:00]  why this feeble abortion survived?  Can you smell it, Chuck?  It smells like malaria, in case you were wondering.  If sad and stupid had a foul odor attached to it.  That's almost right from Apocalypse Now.  Yeah, yeah.  The place smelled like death and malaria.  Well.  I'm pretty sure.  Yeah, well, he absolutely quotes Apocalypse.  He enjoys that movie.  He's made that perfectly clear.  That's great, but it's like your dad did it.  You shouldn't quote it that much.  I know.  It's kind of creepy. 
[01:19:30]  It's a little, really, a little, like, wanting.  And, and.  What are you doing?  Where's Marty?  Love me, Daddy.  I think Marty reached out to him and he's just, he's with Emilio somewhere.  And look, his statement has been, look, my son is very sick and he needs help.  And you think they talk?  No.  I think Marty reached out to him and.  But they don't have a relationship, really?  Seems like they don't have a close relationship.  I don't think so.  I don't know.  They might actually, but when, you know, it's like, like the way I looked at my dad when  I was 15, he's just doing it 30 years later. 
[01:20:00]  Like, all right, I know.  Leave me alone.  Like, that's how I, you know, you don't want to talk to people.  His father knows he's full of shit.  Like, the last thing you want to do when you're beat, when you're, when you're in  this weird character is be around people who can look at you and go, really?  Really?  Really?  That's true.  He needs yes men around him.  He doesn't need, really?  Is that what you're doing?  You see, you see, he sees that his dad's calling and he gets that feeling.  It's not like, oh.  His father is, A, sober a long time.  B, he's Martin Sheen.  Right.  He's unimpressed.  Like, he loves him as his father, but he's unimpressed. 
[01:20:30]  He's not nervous around Charlie.  No.  He's unimpressed with Charlie.  He knows Charlie's full of shit right now.  Yeah, he's not impressed with this at all, right?  No.  He's not believing in the warlock thing?  Yeah.  No.  The warlock thing.  Come on, kid.  Look, warlock.  Yeah.  Come on, warlock.  In case you were wondering, if sad and stupid had a foul odor attached, it would be you,  fuck, bory.  Wow.  You gotta hate that your stage name rhymes with suck.  Personally, I'd find it perfect. 
[01:21:00]  Suck and muck.  Well, he showed him.  He sure did.  I know.  Nyany, nyany, nyany.  Because all he's done is sucked in Hollywood.  That Laurie.  Two and a half men really wasn't that successful.  He did create that, right?  Oh, of course he did.  God, and we love going after those type of people, but Charlie makes it hard.  He really does.  And I don't even like Chuck Lorre, or I have no knowledge of the guy, and I don't care  that Charlie trashes him, but it's like, you sabotaged the entire thing. 
[01:21:30]  You could have just waited a couple of more months.  He hasn't gotten into what was so horrible to make people understand why this is a relief  that you fucked everybody out of the fucking gig, and now...  Yeah.  I'm starting to go with what you're thinking, Jimmy.  He's a spoiled brat.  Hollywood spoiled brat.  And he didn't get his way on this one, and he doesn't know how to handle it.  He's always been this guy.  Right.  But he took it too far.  Yeah.  He thought he knew how far he could take it. 
[01:22:00]  He took it too far.  He got spanked for it, and now the spoiled brat in him is coming out.  Yeah, he's just yelling and screaming and kicking.  What are you doing, man?  Because in the end, he did this to himself.  Now he has burned the CBS bridge, and now he can't go back.  That's not a big bridge.  Don't worry about it.  It's not connected to a lot of stuff or anything.  Warner Brothers isn't a big company.  It's tempting, I'm sure, when everybody's listening.  Like, when basically he thought, oh my God, the whole country wants to hear from me. 
[01:22:30]  And then you start throwing out things.  You're like, fuck everybody.  I got the whole country on my side.  But what he doesn't seem to realize is that that's going to fade away quickly,  because it's going to be very boring for people, as it already is.  Mm-hmm.  Then what?  Yeah, this is a spike.  It and I were talking about before the show.  It's a spike.  Like, he's obviously a famous guy to begin with, but this fame arc that he's on is really a spike.  It's going up very quickly, and then it's just going to go down very quickly on the other side.  Yep.  59,000 tuned in. 
[01:23:00]  How many of the first night?  90.  It was 110,000.  Yeah, that's the audience now.  Yeah, and it's going to drop from there.  She continues to talk about Laura.  You picked a fight with a warlock, you little worm.  Remember this.  After that first drink back.  The drinks you know you want.  The drink you can't avoid any longer.  How's it taste?  How's it feel?  Are you whole again?  At peace?  In love?  You are no match for this warlock. 
[01:23:30]  My power will consume you every losing day.  Ugly whore.  Let's do a scene, maggot.  I speak first.  Me.  Are you an assailant?  Fuck, boy.  I'm a showrunner.  Me.  You'll never.  You're an ugly clown sent by corporate fools to collect your fill.  Chew-heartedly, loser.  More apocalyptic.  Maybe less.  Nothing left.  Nothing. 
[01:24:00]  How's last night's 2.8 in the demo feel?  Ouch.  How about last night's 2.6 as well to follow it?  Should have gone up.  Instead it went down like you on some $4 trollop.  Sizzle losing by.  Sizzle losing by.  Sizzle losing by is going to be the next big.  Nothing.  No, nothing happened with that one either?  It's going to be the next big.  Nothing.  Bill Shuloff, it looks like, on Twitter.  This sounds like Son of Sam ladders.  Just ramblings.  One for the older demo right there.  Yeah.  One for you guys. 
[01:24:30]  Got to talk like Charlie.  Really?  Although he does remind me of how he spoke in Wall Street.  The art of Son.  He did actually talk like that in the original Wall Street.  Yeah.  That's not that far.  Well, I was saying he's acting.  Yeah.  He's doing, he's acting Charlie in this one.  What about?  He's got lines to read.  He's got, uh, he's got gestures.  He's acting.  What about the Morrison angle?  Well, it, we're playing the doors and everything.  Well, for, for the, for the, I know, for trying to be that ironic and fucking poet thing. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  But he's, he's acting to do that.  But we're doing the doors.  Yeah.  I hear the doors.  I hear the doors playing.  We committed to this.  Yeah.  Is it the actor or is it, uh, Charlie Morrison?  He's acting like Charlie Morrison.  Okay.  There you go.  That's what he's doing.  We brought it together.  He's, he's, he's Colonel, he's Colonel Curtains.  One more clip from, uh,  Drapes jokes.  She's corner.  He ends with tiger blood. 
[01:25:30]  What was this about it?  Needs a setup or not really?  Does any of it.  Moving along now to our next item in hand.  There's been global speak regarding my tiger blood.  And yes, it's real.  It's as real as me.  To avoid any speculation, I will now allow my precious tiger blood to be extracted.  He blinks his eyes.  There you go.  Those who deserve it now possess it. 
[01:26:00]  Use it wisely.  I trust that you will.  As I stated earlier, a high treason has occurred.  The scales of justice are in a state of radical disarray.  Wow.  Together we must right this infantile wrong.  Infantile?  One final note.  Sheen's Corner is now for sale as a sports bar.  You know where to find me, so I bid you adieu.  Stay tuned, good soldiers.  I'll see you all very soon on the battlefield. 
[01:26:30]  Dogspeed.  That was, uh, that was it.  That was, uh.  How long was it?  Where did he attack Sean and Crier?  About ten minutes.  He did that in another interview.  Yeah.  Crier said that he reached out to him, so who knows?  Yeah, Crier may be like, hey, why didn't he call his friend?  But maybe he's like sick of it.  Maybe he's like, this guy's self-destructing.  Fuck him.  Yeah, he might have done that.  Or maybe he's just annoyed.  Sheen said he didn't reach out to him.  And he's just, uh, scared and won't be on his side. 
[01:27:00]  And when, uh, Sheen is making multi-million dollar movies, John Crier will be calling him,  begging for a walk-on role.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would be me who'll be doing that.  What did you write on Twitter?  Good soldier.  I'm just kidding, Charlie.  Good soldier.  I'm a good soldier.  Yes.  But Crier claims he did reach out to him.  Mm.  Who knows?  Who knows?  I'm sure he was, uh, he was probably making a good dime.  How's this gonna end, man? 
[01:27:30]  Uh, just in a fizzle.  You think it just fizzles?  This isn't gonna be some big, you know, it's not gonna be Charlie pulling a fucking Arba Dwyer  on his, uh, Sheen's Corner thing.  It's gonna just fizzle out.  Once there's a big news story, once something else clicks, uh, America's interest, uh, very fickle.  We go somewhere else.  It will go away.  Yep.  And then we never go back to the big story.  No.  We'll get breaking news about something else, and that takes our attention away from Charlie,  and then it's too late to go back there. 
[01:28:00]  Where's the golden voice bum?  Yeah.  Where is he?  Oh my god.  I forgot about him already.  The golden voice bum!  He left rehab, and then I think they're doing a reality show, I think.  Mm.  Last I heard.  And, uh, I think the lawyers are gonna get involved with this.  If he, if he's gonna go into this big, huge lawsuit against, um, you know, CBS or Warner  Brothers, whatever.  He's already fucked himself as far as that goes.  Yeah, but the lawyers, if they're gonna have a real lawsuit, they're gonna say, all right,  if you really want us to do this, you gotta shut the fuck up, because you're only gonna 
[01:28:30]  hurt our case here.  And that's how it goes away.  He's gonna kind of get, get the money he was getting for that show by selling t-shirts  and coffee mugs.  Hell no.  With, with winning on it, and.  Hell no.  It's, because, because it's a fickle, people are very fickle with their taste, unless it's  something that's really, like, what he doesn't seem to realize is, you want to capture people  just by being you, but you had them the right way.  Yeah.  You had 20 million a week, or whatever it was.  Oh my god.  People watching you when you were doing what you do. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Like, you were an actor, you were on the number one comedy, and they were fucking all paying  attention to you.  It's like, what are you doing now?  It's like, everybody's watching you for the wrong reasons, because they think you're  just making an asshole out of yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what they're watching for.  And they're certainly, uh, he's getting big numbers, but, you know, he can't sustain  this.  No.  Unless he goes back on the drugs, but then how long can you sustain it if you're on the  drugs?  Even that, it's like, good.  Then you'd be like, oh, there's Charlie on drugs, and, like, it's.  And, and like we discussed, it's a fraternity out there. 
[01:29:30]  They're all talking.  They're like, yeah, someone will hire him for something, of course, but, you know.  I think, like, NBC.  They're really big, nice gigs.  They're, they're like, fuck that.  He'll get movies, because you don't have to be in bed with someone for a movie for fucking  10 years.  He'll probably get some movies, like, I'm sure he could do it if he wants to.  Like, what movies?  Whatever he wants to do.  Really?  Yeah, I'm sure he's.  He's a good actor, so.  He's got insurance issues and all that.  He is.  So someone has to take a chance.  Christian Bale punched his mother, and they still hired him for films. 
[01:30:00]  You know, Christian Bale had a meltdown on, they all are fucking nuts out there.  As long as you're good, I guess.  And maybe a reality show.  Maybe League 3.  But I don't think a reality show would be that interesting after the first one or two.  I mean, we're seeing the reality show now.  So?  This is like, eh, who cares?  Who's the real Charlie Sheen?  Yeah, that is a good question, because we've seen so many.  Because we were the first to say, look, you know, this is, you know, he's playing. 
[01:30:30]  Here's who I think the real Charlie Sheen is.  Which one is it?  The first one he did, where he's hanging out with his laughing yes-men buddies, just being  that too cool for the room, because everyone's laughing at everything I say, hipster, hat guy,  L.A. douchebag.  So he's not that interesting when he does it.  No, no, no.  That's the guy I think it is.  Or a script.  Yeah, yeah.  So he had a script this time.  He had a nice tight shot on himself. 
[01:31:00]  What about the TMZ interview in the backyard?  Was that closest of the real Charlie Sheen?  Yeah, because that was another, like, too cool for the room, spoiled Hollywood brat.  Which, you know, he grew up Martin Sheen's son.  Got right into show biz.  Had a big hit movie, a couple of them, when he was pretty young.  So, Ferris Bueller.  Ferris Bueller.  Red Dawn.  How long was he in Ferris Bueller?  I remember Red Dawn.  Two minutes. 
[01:31:30]  Charlie was in that?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was in the police station.  In the police station.  Playing the drug.  Made out with what's her name there.  Drug fiend.  Do you think that was just a gig, like, look, Martin's kid wants to do this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a star show.  Yeah, yeah.  Just throw him in there, and yeah, that's him right there.  Let me see.  There's the young Charlie Sheen.  Oh, right.  But he's a good actor, too.  It's like, you can't say he stinks or anything.  He was great in Platoon, and Platoon was fucking fantastic.  And then, what was that other movie he was in with Swayze and all the young...  Oh, The Outsiders was great, man. 
[01:32:00]  The Outsiders.  Wait, Charlie was in The Outsiders?  Yeah.  No, he wasn't.  Yeah, I think he was.  No, he wasn't.  No?  No.  Was he in Rumblefish?  I don't know.  I don't do either.  Wait, Charlie wasn't in...  Of course he wasn't.  I was thinking of...  Wasn't Tom Cruise in The Outsiders?  Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio.  Oh, I thought he was in that.  No, no.  As he hit and wrote it.  Fucking C. Thomas Howell, Rob Lowe.  Oh, Emilio was in it.  Emilio, yeah.  Oh, okay.  My mistake.  Jerry Ferdinand. 
[01:32:30]  Look at you.  I just made up Jerry Ferdinand.  Jerry Ferdinand.  Leif Garrett was in it.  Oh, he was the so-sh.  Yeah, he was the so-sh.  Matt Dillon was great.  Yeah.  Do it for Johnny.  Yeah.  He was really good.  Yeah.  You think Vince McMahon's going to be the Malibu Messiah now?  You've got to think that Vince is going to steal some of Charlie's lines.  Vince wants to start stealing his lines as characters.  Yeah.  And now the warlock. 
[01:33:00]  He probably will, though.  He probably will.  He likes feeding off pop culture, right?  Let's goon mess.  He's acting so nutty, he's like a bunch of fruitcakes.  Oh, God.  Chip.  I almost waited, by the way.  Avril Lavigne was here yesterday. 
[01:33:30]  I know.  I saw Opie's video, and I'm like, fucking Avril Lavigne?  Yeah, you like Avril.  That's your type.  I love Avril.  That's kind of your type.  It's kind of.  I know your type.  That's perfect.  That is your type, right?  That is.  I heard she didn't take pictures with anybody.  I would have had to wait an hour, and I was like, you know what?  I opened Kenny in the car.  I just can't do it.  Like, I can't wait an hour.  Why do you have to wait an hour to get a picture with her?  What was so important?  I saw that she had 20, 25 guys around her. 
[01:34:00]  It's not our people, either, because our guys, like Leeds and Annabella, they all asked.  Oh.  It's simply.  Info?  News?  What?  It would have been tough to get a picture with Avril.  Why?  She wasn't.  She had, like, literally 15 people here with her, and a camera crew that was hers with  her, and, like, I was stalking in the lobby when she was gone.  You were?  Oh, yeah.  For a picture?  Yes.  But I didn't get one.  But nobody got one.  What's the problem with taking a few pictures at a place that is helping you, that is helping 
[01:34:30]  push your career forward?  I guess it's because, well, she didn't want to take pictures with everyone.  What is the problem?  What's the problem?  Really?  One person gets one, and another person comes, and another person comes.  Because that's a tough life to take a lot of pictures every day.  It's these shitty, spoiled celebrities, and their shitty, fucking overprotective hangers  on.  Now?  And she's a...  Perhaps she's just shy.  She signs stuff.  I got a signed CD.  Oh, wow. 
[01:35:00]  Did she?  Why wouldn't she take a picture?  Did she have a pimple on her face or something?  Did you ask her?  No, she was just proactive.  She was like, well, her feet are on the commercial.  She was literally just pushing her out.  She didn't even take a picture by herself next to the...  In the logo?  Yeah.  She didn't take any...  But that might have been because there were 15 people kind of saying, okay, you're going  this way, you're going that way.  Maybe that wasn't her thing.  That's people around her.  SiriusXM has to say, look, if you're going to come up here, you're going to take a few  pictures.  Period.  This place will survive without Avril Lavigne.  Didn't she perform?  She did.  She performed like five songs. 
[01:35:30]  Really?  She probably took a couple pictures with the people who interviewed her, maybe.  I made the mistake of on the way home last night mentioning to my girlfriend that I  almost waited an hour for an Avril Lavigne photo.  And she ripped you to pieces.  She said, and I quote, you fucking faggot.  I don't...  Exact words.  Sorry.  You're not pumping it up.  No.  You fucking faggot.  I would have had to dump you if you waited an hour for a picture with me.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would have been rough. 
[01:36:00]  And then I got caught because it was some fucking...  We were on 23rd and 7th, and it was dark, and there was flashing cameras.  So I rolled out my window, and I looked out, and it was just a bunch of drunks taking  pictures.  Oh, no.  But it was humiliating because she caught me.  She's like, you thought that was a fucking celebrity, didn't you?  Oh, shit.  I was like, no.  Well, she's got you down, man.  I was actually embarrassed because I had rolled the thing and pulled my head out to the left.  What's going on there?  Yeah, she brutalized, and justifiably so.  You do have an obsession. 
[01:36:30]  No, but I didn't do it, though.  We talked about it all the way home yesterday.  I filmed only a minute of it, but we talked about it all the way home.  But then I fucking...  We were trying to justify that it was okay you were going home without the picture.  Well, because then Hanson was here, and I had a picture with Hanson I wanted to get signed,  which also didn't go over well last night.  You're going to put that next to your Sabbath picture?  It's amazing why I care.  I don't know why.  Michelle Rodriguez will be in the building Friday, so I have to get my picture with her  side.  But we've talked about it a million times.  I get caring about getting pictures with celebrities, but you need a picture with everybody that's 
[01:37:00]  famous that walks by you.  But I don't do it anymore like I used to.  I've actually passed a lot of ones.  Like her, I just left yesterday thinking I probably could have.  I didn't...  I'm not as crazy as I used to be, because I've met enough of them in proper work circumstances,  and I get annoyed at having to...  It's like, eh.  You make me fucking work for it.  Go fuck yourself.  It starts to annoy me.  Unless it's De Niro or somebody like that.  Then I would work for it.  I don't know where my...  Did we put my video up on Facebook? 
[01:37:30]  I filmed on the way home yesterday about the Aro Levine picture, and Jimmy's pink lips.  How did she love it?  And then everyone had a comment, once again, they turned gay, because I made fun of your  pink lips.  So you never know if you're going to get a good story out of it.  Like, there's ones I've taken that were cool.  Sometimes you don't.  Most times you don't.  But other times, it's just you have it, and again, will I ever do anything with it  at a one-man show?  Maybe not.  Maybe nothing.  Maybe nothing.  But there's just something about it, like, eh.  It would make for a great picture book. 
[01:38:00]  It would, but they don't sell.  I almost did that.  A coffee table book.  Book agents said Metallica's didn't even do as well as they wanted.  And what, they had some like that?  Yeah.  Eddie Trunk actually has a book coming out with a lot...  You know, he's all into metal and shit.  And I saw a copy of it, and it's all photos that you have not seen of these bands, because  his friend was a photographer, of, like, Kiss, and all these cool fucking shots.  That's one that will sell, because it's a small book.  It's not overly expensive.  But a fucking coffee table book, dude, they're hard to sell. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, because they're just expensive, and you're lucky you can go out and get people  to spend 15 bucks on a book.  A coffee table book that turns into a coffee table.  It's...  It's hysterical.  It worked funny.  I can't believe it's a genius.  It was Regis, right?  Yeah, it was on Regis.  Oh, Black Rock Coalition by Black Rock.  Oh, God, that's right, his coffee table book.  Don't make fun of his baby, man.  That's great.  Earl tweets about this damn book at least once a day.  What is that, a book of mug shots? 
[01:39:00]  It's pretty cool.  I thought it was a really great idea, because basically what Earl did was he took a Facebook  page and turned it into a book.  And I thought that's really cool.  No one's doing that.  Yeah.  You know, why just go to Facebook and look at all sorts of pictures when you could just  pay $40?  I mean, that's awesome.  Are there any words in that book?  I don't know.  There's not many.  I mean, it's Earl.  I'm seeing a lot of pictures.  Oh, okay.  Did he write that?  What?  You mean the two run-on sentences?  Yeah, probably.  Or did someone ghostwrite it? 
[01:39:30]  Oh, man.  What?  You set up your own joke.  No, somebody...  Sometimes...  You really did.  You really set up your own joke.  I know.  And you didn't even wait for us to...  I was playing with myself in the yard.  I was throwing the ball up and hitting it with the bat, and then getting the ball and coming  back.  You didn't even wait for us to give you an answer that you didn't care about anyway, because  you wanted to get to your line.  I had to get to my...  There wasn't even a space between...  My line.  You're like the ethnic comic that purposely says something wrong just to correct yourself  on stage.  You know what I mean?  What is he saying? 
[01:40:00]  You know?  How do you say it?  The guy that purposely says things wrong.  Yeah.  B with a bunch of motherfucking O's.  Too good.  Yeah.  Too fucking good.  I agree with you there.  All right.  Well...  Do you know how annoyed I would have been if I was so tired yesterday and I waited an  hour for a picture and didn't get it?  And didn't get one?  Oh, boy.  Fuck her.  Enough already.  I wish.  I like that, Avril.  She was in the green room just waiting around.  That's when you take a few pictures with people that work at the place that is helping 
[01:40:30]  you in your career.  It would have been worth it for Avril.  Fuck her.  Who cares?  You don't need to say rude things.  Huh?  You don't need to say rude things.  And then you do get a picture and they're grumpy as shit.  I was a big Genesis fan growing up and Phil Collins was a douchebag.  It really was.  And we were trying to be cool and he just was like, are you ready?  Yeah.  Are you ready?  The picture I have with him is just terrible.  I guess he has to retire because if he plays drums he could die or something now. 
[01:41:00]  What?  Why?  But then they're saying that's not true.  Is that what the story is?  There's also rumors he's really depressed, which makes sense because he did not want  to take the pictures with us.  No.  And I even said, hey, man, I've been a huge fan.  Piss off.  I know he's heard this shit a million times, but still, how tough is your life?  Just fucking smile and make believe you're hearing it for the first time.  I fucked up, though.  You could be in a factory somewhere, asshole.  Exactly.  That's exactly it.  It's like that's why I say when me and Patrice were talking yesterday about cakewalk 
[01:41:30]  jobs, like, yeah, there's a lot of pressure here or every job, but it's not exactly like  when I see guys outside in the winter doing fucking construction or like, you know, holding  a flag and waving people over one lane, they're making okay money and decent.  It's like, I don't want to fucking do that.  Talk to those guys.  If you ask them, would you like to blow off this job and then just have people wanting  your picture all day long?  Would you trade jobs?  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Hey.  Would you want to hang with friends and just talk shit for four hours a day and make fun  of whoever you want?  It's the greatest gig ever.  Working sucked.  I could attest to it.  It was awful.  Working was terrible.  Fucking the highlight of me working at Christophe Silver was when I would fart and my two Haitian  co-workers, Philippe and Lionel.  One of my fun.  Lionel.  Philippe was a funny fucking dude, man.  This Haitian guy was a funny guy, but he would always get milk farts, which were horrible.  Milk fart. 
[01:42:30]  You said it like that?  Yeah, they had very heavy Haitian.  But Lionel was a Haitian guy, very quiet.  One of my greatest memories, and I mean as a person, is I was on the packing line at  Christophe, and I cut a fucking gasser.  It was heinous.  And Lionel was walking.  It was the end of the packing line.  And then you had probably from where I am to where the TVs are beyond Opie, probably about  10 feet to the office.  And Lionel walked between me and the office, and it hit him, and he actually ducked. 
[01:43:00]  I'll never forget that.  He ducked out, and he went, oh my God!  And he ducked as if I had thrown a fucking cinder block at him.  It's one of my fondest memories as a man.  I was just starting comedy.  It was 1990 sometime, and I've never been happier with myself.  Wow.  That's good.  You got your most embarrassing tape today?  Oh, God, please.  It's here, Danny's got it.  Can we finally finish up that bit? 
[01:43:30]  Oh, please, let's start it over a month ago.  When do you want to do that?  After, uh...  Today?  Sooner, better than later.  Because we lose Jimmy tomorrow and Friday, so...  Yeah, let's do it today.  We got it.  I'll be in Sanny Franny doing Cobbs.  Nice.  Sometime after the break, we'll do that.  And don't forget about your CD, Jimmy.  Oh, Despicable is now out.  It's number two behind Daniel Taj.  Let's be honest.  There's no way I'm passing Daniel, that handsome bastard.  Fuck him.  He's a good dude.  I would love...  Believe me, I'd love to hate him, but he's a nice guy.  You should get him on the show. 
[01:44:00]  Maybe he would do it.  I mean, is he ever in town or is he in LA?  I don't know.  It seems like he would like this show.  We've never had him on.  I don't know.  He interviewed me once on a Comedy Central thing.  He was great.  I see the tweets.  People want us to get him.  I would like to have him on.  That would be nice.  Oh, that son of a bitch is good looking and successful.  I hope he falls into a fucking glass pit.  Where's there a glass pit?  There isn't one, but if there is one, I hope he trips and falls into it and then looks like  me and sees how hard it is.  You want to build one just in case?  Just in case he's around.  Just in case he's around it.  Yeah, we should get him.  We'll do Jimmy's Most Embarrassing Tapes sometime after the break. 
[01:44:30]  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  24 years ago today, U2's Joshua Tree was released.  That's why a little U2 for everybody.  Ah.  You want to feel old, though.  Forget about that Joshua Tree. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Emmanuel Lewis is 40 years old today.  Wow.  Yeah.  40?  40.  Fuck.  I'd still fuck him.  What does he look like these days?  And what's he doing?  Still looks like a little kid.  Does he look like a kid still?  He looks like a fat little kid now.  That's gotta suck, man.  He looks maybe like he's 16 years old.  That really has to blow.  I hold in my hand.  I know we're going to do the Jimmy tape. 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  But this is too good not to do.  Whatever you gotta do first, I'm all for it.  I hold in my hand a mystery band.  A mystery band.  A mystery band.  Right.  I got samples of the mystery band.  That's interesting.  And I want you to try to figure out who this is.  Who it is.  Yes.  Mystery band on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Okay.  Here's a...  Okay.  Mystery band.  Okay.  Okay.  Here's a sample of their first song. 
[01:46:00]  Whoa.  There's nowhere to run.  No one is sleeping.  The damage is done.  Shot to the heart.  And you're too bland.  You give love a bad name.  Bad name.  I play my pawn.  And you play your game.  You give love a bad name.  Bad name.  Will you give love a bad name?  Is Chris Jericho?  Sounds like Vince Neil.  Bad name.  Not bad, by the way. 
[01:46:30]  That's not bad, right?  No, it's okay.  A little affected on the voice, but...  Whatever it is.  Mystery band.  Sounds like Vince Neil.  Yeah, but I don't think Vince Neil would do that.  A cover?  You both would know.  When I say the name.  Can we hear it again?  Well, we'll go with another...  It's not Forgi.  Is it Troy Kwan?  It's not Troy Kwan.  Oh.  Okay.  It's not Forgi.  Try this one.  Forgi?  It's bothering you, right? 
[01:47:00]  Because you're sort of...  Something about that fucking voice is familiar. 
[01:47:30]  Another guess?  By anyone?  Singing sticks and fucking...  And Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi.  Is it Jared Breck?  Holy shit.  No.  Jared Breck.  This might help.  I love your names.  This might help.  Okay.  A slow one.  When the lights go down in the city... 
[01:48:00]  Is this Steve Perry?  And the sunshine...  It's a woman.  I would answer that with sort of.  Oh, okay.  That's a good...  That's a good clue.  Sorry, right now.  I was getting really mad, but I'll answer that with sort of. 
[01:48:30]  That's a clue, right?  So we're looking at somebody that may be a little...  Anyone?  Is this anybody?  Fezzy.  Someone you know.  Both of you guys know.  And sort of a woman.  Have they ever been in this building?  Yes.  One more.  We know them on a personal level? 
[01:49:00]  Or just strictly professional?  Like...  Ooh.  Like is it somebody...  I don't mean personal level like, you know...  We hang out, but...  I would say...  Like do I know this person like I know fucking Tom Cruise?  You know, like I just know of them.  Do you know anyone on a personal level, Anthony?  Not really.  I try to avoid that at all costs.  Not even Anthony.  I know.  Thank God.  I would answer that with a combination of both.  Oh. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  I'll give you your last sample.  They don't work here?  We're playing mystery band.  They don't work here, right?  Uh, they work here.  Oh, boy.  It's not, uh...  One more sample?  It's not Travis.  It's not Jeremy, is it?  No, no, no.  Jesus.  Come on, it's a joke.  One more sample.  Okay.  Playing mystery band.  We didn't have no internet, but man, I never will forget. 
[01:50:00]  The way the moonlight shined above her hair.  And we were trying different things.  We were smoking funny things.  Thinking of our body, like you were a favorite song.  Sipping whiskey out the bottle.  Not thinking about tomorrow.  Singing sweet home Alabama.  All summer long.  It's not bad.  What do you think of the performance, Ant?  You know something about bands.  It's not bad, right?  Well, it's, yeah, there's a lot of covers going on there, and I, um... 
[01:50:30]  You're right around it, man.  You've asked the right questions.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just...  You're right around it.  No, it's not Derek.  Sort of a woman.  Well, that's...  Is it one of our, um, our, uh, upper echelon supervisors?  Oh, no.  Hell no.  That would be funny.  Yeah, I can't picture Rob Cross belting those songs out.  God, I didn't think we were going to go this deep into it. 
[01:51:00]  Another sample.  Yeah, yeah, please.  Please.  Me and some guys from school  Had a band, we tried real hard  Jimmy Quinn, surely got married  Should have known, you never get far  But when I move back now  Is someone on our, in our circle?  Someone that works here in our circle?  There's no choice  And I'll always be there 
[01:51:30]  Those were the best days of my life  Um...  Ah, man.  Wait.  I would...  How would you answer that?  Is it Roland?  Oh, I don't know who it is.  Iraq's saying I would say yes.  I would say...  It's not Lil Nicky.  I would say...  Ah, this will give it away, but fuck it.  Yeah.  Who cares in the end?  Uh, I would say was.  Oh, okay.  Is it Steve? 
[01:52:00]  No, it's not Steve.  It's not Steve.  Yes.  The answer would have to be was on that.  Was.  Okay.  Was it an intern?  No.  And they still work here?  I'm running out of songs.  Do they still work here?  Yes.  Okay.  Was.  We treated this person like an intern.  It's not stinky.  No.  Still works here.  Treated the person like an intern.  Treated the person like an intern.  Butcher?  Was part of the circle.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Butcher?  No.  Was part of the circle.  Was part of the circle.  But was ostracized for being queer.  Meaning no heaven for you.  No heaven for you and a big boo from the guy on the cross.  Wait a minute.  Don't give it away.  Is it David?  My David.  My David.  Imagine if it was David.  I have found all that shimmers in this world.  It's short to fade. 
[01:53:00]  I can't believe you're not going to get this.  Works here.  Was part of the inner circle.  Works.  That's right.  Strawberry supply.  I don't even know anyone that works here that was part of the inner circle.  I can't name everyone on our staff.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Voice isn't bad.  It really isn't bad.  Wait a minute.  Don't give it away.  In all fairness to the people who are going to go, who gives a fuck? 
[01:53:30]  I didn't expect it to go this long.  This was a throwaway.  We're six songs into the sample.  Don Wiki Wicklin?  Don Wiki Wicklin.  That's Don Wiki Wicklin?  That's Don Wiki Wicklin.  Wow.  And his band.  Don Wiki Wicklin?  That's Don Wiki Wicklin.  Wow.  He's belting it out.  You know what?  Sounds good.  Who was a big part of our channel for a while.  And then he moved on when the merger happened, unfortunately.  Is he back in D.C.?  And I say, unfortunately.  Yes, I did say that, Don. 
[01:54:00]  Where?  That's Don Wiki Wicklin's band.  Oh, look at Don Wiki Wicklin.  Rocking it.  He fucking could sing.  Yeah.  And that's him on the vocals.  He's got a high voice.  Yeah.  Range.  Yeah.  Is there a little more?  Any more samples?  That was actually good.  We pretty much ran out.  What about the Brian Adams one?  I want to hear that again.  I want to love somebody like you, Keith Urban.  I don't really know that song.  No.  That's the only one we've got left, if you want to hear that.  I like the Brian Adams.  That was great.  I guess for the country people out there, we can do this.  I'm letting go of all my lonely yesterdays.  I forgive myself for all the things I've made. 
[01:54:30]  Put a twang into it for us.  That was just one thing, the only thing I want to do.  I want to love somebody, love somebody like you.  It's no Dara.  It's good.  I feel bad I never saw him, because he always would talk about his band.  He would do this on the weekends.  We've got the invites over the years.  We're like, eh.  I never knew that.  I would check that out.  That's not bad. 
[01:55:00]  Fuck yeah.  It's not bad at all.  He's playing a lot of gigs.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  He's gigging.  And he's got the pigs coming out to see him.  Oh, no.  Is he really playing Faggers Island?  Done.  Not bad, right, eh?  Yeah.  So, yeah, he's...  I'll give it to him.  Yeah, we found that overnight, so I figured we'd...  Wow, that's...  Him and Angie do a little karaoke together.  Ah, you know? 
[01:55:30]  No.  That would entail him coming over my house.  Huh?  That would entail him coming over my house.  You're a nice guy.  No, I'm kidding, of course.  I always liked the Don, Donnie Wicklund.  He loves you, bro.  Don, Don.  He loves you.  I know.  He loves all of us.  We just treated him shitty.  I didn't.  I don't think Jimmy treated him shitty.  No, we got along great.  I treated him shitty.  I know him.  His wife is very nice.  They're nice people.  Some of that stunt brain up there is an option.  Stunt brain. 
[01:56:00]  Stunt brain.  You missed the stunt brain?  Ah, who wouldn't?  I do like him.  The stunt brain.  He'll IM me sometimes.  I have to pretend I'm not there.  See, I'm getting killed.  That wasn't supposed to be a long bit that I was milking.  I thought these guys would get it right away.  That's a big one, though.  That was a good one, because fucking Wiki we know well.  Wiki was a big part of what we're doing on satellite.  Absolutely.  You haven't heard about him in a while, and we do have newer listeners,  but a big part of the crowd knows who Don Wicklund is. 
[01:56:30]  So, yeah, he does that on the side.  Pretty good.  That's something.  You want to play Jimmy's tape?  Yes, please.  Can we wait until next break?  Because there's other things.  No, I want to hear those.  Oh, there's other things?  Like watching me?  No, no.  I bet it's good.  Jimmy says there's other things.  Camden?  Anthony wanted to discuss Camden.  Oh, you know, we can discuss Camden.  You know.  We should give the Camden update, Ant.  Give a shout-out to the people in Camden.  Jimmy's not getting away today.  Look what time it is.  I know.  He's got a stall till 10.  That ain't happening.  Like the photo of Camden crime, and they just throw these three white kids. 
[01:57:00]  It's like, what the fuck are you pussies doing in the media?  Oh, God, yes.  What are you doing?  Is that what they did?  They showed three white kids.  It's like, you, but they weren't even like tough like biker guys.  They were like these fucking like these skater kids.  And that's a safe one to do.  Everyone knows most of the crime in Camden is not done by white guys.  It's not white guys.  Just stop it.  If you want to do it in, I don't know, somewhere else.  But that's a safe one. 
[01:57:30]  No one's going to call you out on that.  It's so fucking ridiculous.  Yeah.  Oh, Camden crime.  And they showed a bunch of white guys hanging out.  The crime, the majority of the crime done in Camden is black.  Black on black.  By the way, because we're going to definitely get into this, we should promote Don Wicklund's band.  Where can they go to see more of that?  They're actually going to be at Cobbs in San Francisco this Thursday through Saturday.  Damn, that's a great gig for them.  It sure is.  Not for me, apparently, but for them.  Is there a website or something at least? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, you can look at all the awesome pictures and tour dates at broadcastrocks.com.  That's the name of their band?  That's the name of their website.  I think the name of their band is Broadcast.  Broadcast is the name of their band.  Oh, I get it.  Because he's in radio.  Right.  It's broadcastrocks.com.  Okay.  Because, you know, there are people that will check them out.  They've got a bunch of tour dates coming up.  Okay.  Sorry.  Back to Camden.  Yes.  So they got rid of what?  Half the police force?  Yeah, that's good.  Just when they were trying to clean it up. 
[01:58:30]  And there was this whole push to really kind of clean up Camden.  Then they decided, you know what?  Let's take away half the police force.  Was it half?  Yeah.  And see if they could do that.  Yeah.  They laid off 160 police officers.  Yeah.  Let's take half the cops in Camden and just get rid of them.  And crime shouldn't go up.  And it might have gone up, but it's really inconsequential.  It's a city of 80,000 residents.  Yeah.  Aggravated assaults with firearms since they took the police officers away. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  What was that?  Two months ago.  That's like, I would say, 2%.  Assaults with firearms aggravated?  Yeah.  259%.  259%.  Oh.  259%.  It's the most...  200%.  That's great.  What does that mean?  If there were 100, that now means it was... 
[01:59:30]  How do you do that?  That was 259.  259, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a horrible city.  And it's almost like the library is closed.  Not that it was being used.  All libraries are eventually going to go, I think.  Yeah.  Just the cops and the firemen.  It's like, of all the people you have to...  Fuck, who cares if there's a budget debt?  What does that mean?  How about this, Christy?  How about you fucking stop allowing the Turnpike and Parkway to fuck people,  and you do something with that money that's good?  Yeah.  You got to provide the basic needs for the people. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  And the basic needs, you know, hopefully the teachers are all right,  and the school systems are all right.  Camden?  Well, no, I know.  Teachers?  They're called correctional officers in Camden.  And I'm not even going to argue with you, you know?  But, I mean, I'm talking in general for all the cities and stuff,  and then you can't take away firehouses,  and you can't take police off the street.  That's basic needs.  Find it somewhere else.  Yeah.  Find it the fuck somewhere else.  It really isn't going to help the economy of Camden.  If you're paying taxes, you should be able to get basic needs. 
[02:00:30]  Mm-hmm.  You know, I don't give a fuck about Camden,  but this is happening everywhere.  I don't have to go there.  I don't care.  But it's just a state of priorities in the way we think.  Which is happening in every city.  Is that Camden?  Every fucking town.  I swear to you, that looks like Iraq.  Yeah.  That looks like one of those streets in Iraq.  With the bad sweaters that they get to wear?  Yeah.  And the fucking, like, snipers.  Always makes me laugh.  RPGs they're walking around with.  You think the residents of Camden have Steeler Super Bowl championship shirts? 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  It's a third world country.  When I was watching that whole Egypt thing, and now Libya, all I could, all I, I get distracted  by all the bad sweaters, you see.  They love bad sweaters.  Where are they getting their bad sweaters from?  Van Gusen.  You really thought that was Iraq, huh?  Yeah.  It looked like Iraq.  It doesn't look like America.  No.  It looks worse than Baltimore.  Yep.  Or the projects of Baltimore.  Camden's just a fucking film.  Yes.  It looks just a wreck.  Wow, look at how bad that is. 
[02:01:30]  And I know it's radio and you can't see, but if we had a visual element, then we would  show you.  It's horrible.  Deteriorating streets of Camden.  They're showing just rows of apartments.  Who's that guy?  Just horrid fucking places.  That's one of the cops that got to keep his job.  Is that the lone cop?  Is that the lone cop?  Poor bastards.  Look at these.  You know how overworked these guys must be?  You got to be crazy to be a remaining cop in that area.  That looks good.  I didn't do nothing. 
[02:02:00]  I didn't do nothing.  They've just given up on that city.  I just was participating in some gives me debt.  I love the gives me debt.  Where did you find that?  I saw a website.  Is there a website?  There's a website.  The gives me debt?  And it says, yeah.  It's like, oh boy, another case of gives me debt.  It's gives me debt.  And then there's my dickin.  When someone's trying to get into some my dickin.  That's rape.  This can't be a news article. 
[02:02:30]  Is that the headline?  My dickin?  Hordes of gives me debt.  Uh-oh.  And then a word.  Line up for housing vouchers.  Riot police called.  Gibbs me debt.  When I first read gives me debt.  And it was used as one word.  Like, this is purely a case of gives me debt.  This is what it says.  It says, hordes of gives me debt niggers line up for housing vouchers.  Riot police called.  I love the fact that they made the entire headline legit. 
[02:03:00]  Except by throwing that in.  I know.  But do you know how fast that ruins your credibility in the media?  Did you read the site, though?  Irate Irishman.  It's the Irate Irishman.  Oh, it's a, okay.  Yeah.  But even that looks like it could be a legitimate publication because of the way the font is.  Yeah, it looked very professional.  We're being called dumbasses.  And I think, yeah, I think it is 359 crimes from 100.  Yeah.  259% would make it 359. 
[02:03:30]  You've got to double it.  Yeah.  And then add.  You have to double.  Yeah.  And then the other thing.  Yeah, and then the other thing.  So it's 359.  All right.  I'm sorry.  30,000 Gibbs mid-tad niggers showed up to receive Section 8 housing applications in East Point Wednesday,  suffering through hours in the hot sun, angry flare-ups, and, oh, God.  No.  Come on.  All right.  Is this guy just a racist with a site?  Yeah, this guy's a racist.  Obviously, he's a racist.  You thought it was a real news story?  No, no, no, no.  You thought you were reading Huffington Post or something? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, my God.  I didn't know if it was just one guy posting something or if it was part of a bigger, you know.  No, this is a racist site, and that's why the racist language in the articles.  But any, you know, violent crime in Canada overall is up 19%.  Yeah.  Murders and robberies, however, were down for the period.  There's not many people left to kill.  Yeah, they're not getting reported.  And half the cops are gone, so they were the ones usually being assaulted. 
[02:04:30]  Jiminy Cricket.  Cam, the police chief, Scott Thompson, has cut his salary by $15,000 and demoted many of his remaining senior police officers to patrol positions after the massive layoffs, according to the New York Times.  So the remaining police force of 200 officers is middle-aged.  200 officers for 80,000 residents.  Wow.  Amazing.  And they all can't work at the same time, obviously.  No.  It's just...  Isn't Camden the place that they were making the T-shirts and wearing them? 
[02:05:00]  What would the shirt say?  It's our town now or something?  It's our town.  It's a Gibbs mid-air.  What does it say?  Gibbs mid-air.  Our turn now.  Thank you, Bill of Jersey.  Wow.  Oh, God.  That's really fucking horrendous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Camden's just a nightmare.  Yeah, I don't really care about Camden.  I don't have to go there.  I never will.  I feel bad for anybody that has to live there.  That stinks.  Yeah, but...  Fucking move.  But they're doing it in New York City and cities across America.  If you're paying a ridiculous amount of taxes, you deserve the basic needs. 
[02:05:30]  Basic shit.  I bet the taxes aren't all that high in Camden.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good point.  I bet they're pretty low.  Yeah, but it's a whole Jersey thing.  Jersey!  So, like, all right, which city can we sacrifice?  Because we're not spending the money properly.  Eh, there's a whole cultural thing going on that, um...  What do we got there?  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Wow.  Oh, we did this already. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  The racial makeup of Camden is, um...  Wow.  There's a lot of white people.  There's...  No, there's not.  There's 4,000 white people in Camden.  Out of 80,000?  All huddled in one room, terrified.  And between...  Between blacks and Hispanics, there are 70,000, uh, people.  And 4,000...  That's like the Alamo.  Wow. 
[02:06:30]  If you're white, what are you doing?  You're sticking around for what?  I don't know.  Does grandma still live there?  Yeah.  Get out!  Gotta leave.  That must just...  Why would you stay there?  It's gotta be like I Am Legend when you go home at night.  Just pour bleach on the stairs and lock your doors, man.  Wow.  Yeah.  There are plenty of places like this around the country, though.  Yeah.  It's, um...  Did we...  I don't know. 
[02:07:00]  Did we talk about the roads, too, that hit the papers yesterday?  Hmm.  Something we bitch about a lot, there's a part of the Long Island Expressway and the Cross  Bronx Expressway in the New York area.  Oh, yeah.  They're saying, uh, some of the worst bottlenecks in the entire country.  And it's two roads, if you live in this area, you're well aware of.  And it will cause heart attacks.  Yeah, you just...  Your stress level goes up.  People are dying because of these roads.  Yeah.  And, you know...  How do they do it every day?  I can't...  I don't know.  And this is...  You know, we bitch about these dumb politicians that take on the soft shit. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Violent video games.  People are playing so many violent video games now, and you're not seeing anybody doing  anything crazy.  But you get the politicians every once in a while, they gotta get their face on the news  about the violent video games.  And then you got these roadways that everyone is aware are just a complete nightmare, causing  such stress that I guarantee people are having heart attacks and dying.  And politicians, they know it's so complicated, they don't want to touch it. 
[02:08:00]  They just want to leave it the fuck alone.  And what do you do about that, though?  There's some places you can't even expand the road.  But it's not an easy solution, but you owe it to the people paying taxes to make it a  little easier.  But they're not going to even try to make it easier for those people.  Because that, to me, is just beyond fixing.  I think there's a 13-mile stretch on the LIE there.  The average is 52 minutes to get through it.  I blame the drivers, too, to a certain extent. 
[02:08:30]  People are so bad at wanting to get from point A to point B at a reasonable time.  And they'll bitch about it, but they drive like fuck dick.  I got in such an...  How do you drive like a fuck dick?  Oh, God.  Anyone who's in front of me is a fuck dick.  I got in an argument with some idiot in that Volkswagen Rabbit.  He wouldn't get out of my way.  And I whip around him.  And then I'm driving around cabs and everything.  And finally...  Two different issues, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, because these roadways are like... 
[02:09:00]  It's bumper to bumper, no matter when you go.  There's someone at the beginning of the line that ain't fucking doing what they're supposed  to be doing.  You think?  That's what I think.  So there's less room for error on those roads?  Yeah.  Here's the other day.  Here's what happened.  I'm going across town.  And I'm behind this guy in a Volkswagen Rabbit or whatever.  Fuck Jetta he's in.  And I'm on his ass because I'm trying to make it through the next light.  And he's fucking la-dee-dying.  Like when I come up to a light, I'm looking at the fucking don't walk sign if it's flashing. 
[02:09:30]  It's ready to turn red.  I'm like, fuck, I got to get through this light.  All that shit.  And I want to make it through.  And this guy's like, there's space in front of him.  So I whip around him because he jammed on his brakes and pulled over.  So I whip around him.  I'm zigzagging through cabs and everything.  I finally get to the Midtown Tunnel, kind of to the Midtown Tunnel.  And this idiot pulls up next to me and rolls his window down and looks at me.  So I roll my window down.  I go, problem?  I go, problem what?  He goes, you made it real far driving like that. 
[02:10:00]  And I go, you know why?  I go, because I kept encountering assholes just like you in front of me.  I go, they're all driving like you.  Like an asshole.  And he's like, you're on my ass.  He goes, if you would have hit me.  I go, what have?  I go, I didn't.  I don't start getting into this.  I go, if a media would have hit you, what would you do?  Shut up.  And he goes, oh, I'm going to tailgate you.  I go, fine.  I don't care.  I'll step on my brakes.  Like you did yours.  Was the finger itching? 
[02:10:30]  A little bit, right?  Are you kidding?  A little bit.  What did he look like?  He was actually some fucking Guido asshole.  Yeah, sounds like it.  Some Guido douchebag.  And the thing that got me was when he rolled his window down, he just was looking at me  with no expression on his face, with like a stare, like he's staring me down through  my passenger window, like he was expecting me to just turn my head and not look at him.  And I rolled my window down.  I was like, what?  What?  You're driving like a fucking cunt, is what he was doing. 
[02:11:00]  Go through the fucking intersection when it's green.  How did it end?  Maybe they got behind you.  I called him an asshole.  And then he tried to, he revs his engine and takes off and goes into the right lane of  the eastbound Midtown Tunnel, which made me laugh because you never go in the right  lane of the eastbound tube.  No.  So I went in the left lane and he's stuck behind a garbage truck.  And I just, I slowly pull up next to him and I went, ha, ha, ha, gave him a little wave  and took off.  Did he wave back? 
[02:11:30]  No.  He was so pissed.  He's behind, brah, moh, brah, moh, brah, with nothing but smoke coming out of me.  Smoked garbage.  Garbage smell.  Oh, it was horrible.  Little pieces of cement.  And I'm just fucking 50 miles an hour.  The tunnel to me looks like the launch tube from Battlestar Galactica.  Just flying out of me.  I'm out of there.  Fuck him.  You bring up something really good, by the way, especially when you live in New York. 
[02:12:00]  You ever have the 10 second over the top someone could die argument at a light?  Yeah.  And then it's over and then you both awkwardly just wait for the light to change for the  last 50 seconds?  You don't know what to do.  We got our little argument.  You get this blast of, I'm going to fucking kill you.  He's yelling, you're yelling, oh yeah, oh yeah.  And then it just ends.  Yeah.  And now you're awkwardly just waiting for the light to change.  Because you can't really commit.  You can't really just get out and what, are you going to have a fist fight now? 
[02:12:30]  I was trying to get around a tractor trailer once to get through a light.  Tractor trailers in Manhattan are just fucking insane.  So I'm trying to get around them and I'm making my moves.  I'm squeezing.  I couldn't quite do it.  I get stuck at a light.  Now I'm next to him.  He rolls his window down.  I roll mine down.  He goes, what are you doing?  I go, I go, look, I just want to, I said, I got to get out of this fucking city.  I was just trying to get around you so I could fucking zoom through the lights.  A cop?  No, a truck. 
[02:13:00]  Big 18 wheeler.  But he called you out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I go, I'm just, and he goes, he goes, uh, he just went, I, I hear you.  Like he just knew.  Driving him in, it just sucks.  It does.  It sucks.  And I know it's local, but I, one more thing I was, I wanted to address the, uh, stretch  of, um, the Grand Central Parkway, it goes eastbound, um, uh, but the westbound side  from, uh, Jackie Robinson to the expressway is probably the worst stretch of road for people  that won't get out of the fucking way in any lane. 
[02:13:30]  Every lane, there's someone doing 20 and you're like, what about, and that's a complicated  roadway too.  Cause every lane means something.  Yeah.  Right.  And people can't figure it out after years and years of driving.  Yup.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like you think you're online for the long, we're going real long.  Expressway, right.  You think you're online for the Long Island Expressway and realizes, no, it's just a bunch  of dummies.  And then you, you switch lanes and realize you got a clear shot right up to the fucking ramp.  Clear shot right to the fucking ramp.  I know.  I've done that so many times. 
[02:14:00]  The right lane people think they got to be in the right lane for that ramp and do like  five miles an hour.  Right.  And then the next two lanes over, they're doing 10 miles an hour.  And then you got the far left lane.  That's for the people just, you know, continuing.  But they are too.  That lane too is like, stop this fucking idiot.  They don't know what lane to be in.  I know.  And that I think is a cause of major traffic in this city.  People that just can't drive.  But you do know the cross parks, that thing.  Oh, it's constantly fucking clogged.  And that's worse than the other one I said.  At any hour too.  I think it's 15 miles and it's over an hour average commute time. 
[02:14:30]  That means during, obviously, rush hour, it's way, way fucking hard.  How do you do that?  Every day.  I was behind one guy one time and we're driving and I pull up next to him.  I'm like, where did you get your license out of a Crackin' Jack's box?  What did he say?  What could he say?  What did he say?  Well, you had him there.  What did you expect him to say?  Oh, sorry, Chip.  Chip's getting mad at me. 
[02:15:00]  I get scared when Chip gets mad.  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy's tape next.  I'm still looking at Avril Lavigne pictures.  I'm looking at this.  I'm such a creep.  This story about this, fuck, dad, I'll kill my son's murderer if he's released.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you fucking hear that?  It's fucking, it just, the fact, like, I'm kind of against the death penalty just because  of the way it's set up.  And I think poor people get it.  Can you explain the story, though?  Obviously, the headline says a lot.  Like, you hope this father does it. 
[02:15:30]  It's like this fucking, the father of a five-year-old boy, the kid was killed in 1975, and he has  vowed to murder the guy who did it as aggressively and painfully as he killed my son if he's released.  The guy told the radio, he said he blames himself because he accepted a plea deal.  Like, a plea deal, it was intended to spare the kid's family the horrific details of his death.  Like, I guess the, uh, they, this guy ate the kid, like he fucking ate his flesh. 
[02:16:00]  I don't know if he did it while he was alive or if he killed him.  I don't know.  I haven't read all the details.  But the father said I was a coward about himself for accepting that deal, which would allow him  to get out on early release with good behavior.  So he's given 40 years.  Which, why are you given 40 years when you kill a fucking five-year-old?  It makes no fucking sense.  Disgusting.  And he tried to kill, the reason they caught him for killing a five-year-old is he tried  to kill a 14-year-old, tried to strangle him.  The 14-year-old got away and told his father. 
[02:16:30]  His father called the cops, and cops were investigating that crime, and they both turned  each other and looked and went, holy shit, this could be the guy that killed that kid  years ago.  How are you not just thrown in jail forever?  What the fuck is wrong with the judicious stuff?  Forever.  40 years you can get out after killing a five-year-old?  40 years, by the way.  He wound up, he's getting 12 years shaved off that sentence for good behavior.  And he wouldn't have, though, if they had not accepted that deal.  So they could accept the deal.  But why is it, how about this?  It's forever. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Or if it's going to be 40 years, it's 40 years.  Fuck the good behavior.  Yeah.  And he was 16 at the time.  So you're talking...  He wasn't showing good behavior when he was trying to eat the kid after he killed him.  It's disgusting what happens with that.  Yeah, good behavior in prison.  Wow.  You're supposed to be.  Right.  And there's things in place to kind of keep you...  The guy was 16 when he did it.  Yeah.  The guy was 16 years old.  He lured the kid into his house and stabbed him in the heart and then hid the small body 
[02:17:30]  in a trunk.  And who cares if there's bad behavior in prison?  Yeah.  Who care?  Yeah.  That's infuriating.  Just fucking infuriating.  It's disgusting, dude.  They looked for this kid for eight years.  Eight years.  Shellacked the kid's bones?  Yeah.  Yeah, the kid's bones, like, on his dresser.  What a ghoul.  What a piece of fucking garbage. 
[02:18:00]  Is the father in trouble for saying he'll kill?  No, I don't think the father cares.  Yeah, of course not.  And that's fine.  I don't think he's concerned.  But then all of a sudden...  And I love what he's saying.  Yeah.  I love it.  And I hope no jury would convict him.  I hope they'd give him some kind of an emotional distress.  Yeah.  I love it.  Here's the quote.  I do intend, if this man is released anywhere in my vicinity, or if I can find him after  the fact, I do intend to kill this man.  That's great.  Oh, I love this guy.  I cannot think.  I cannot sleep.  All I think about is trying to find a way to get this man to kill him. 
[02:18:30]  Let me tell you something.  If you're in that scumbag's position in jail, that's really the last thing you want to hear.  Is that a guy is that...  Anyone who is that bent on murdering somebody...  Because you know, and also you know, as a child murderer, this guy's no badass.  He's a coward.  He's a fucking faggot.  Yeah.  Pussy motherfucker.  It's like, if you're willing to say that publicly, and all you think about is murdering  this guy, and you don't care, you're going to kill him. 
[02:19:00]  In the line of fire, where Malkovich was stalking the president, he said, I'm willing to trade  my life for his.  Even a guy on the president's level, or a politician, if you're willing to trade your  life, you could get it done.  And if you're willing to publicly say, I'm giving everything up to get this guy, you're  fucking going to get him.  If history has shown us anything.  Right.  Exactly.  How many years would the father get?  I don't know.  I know he doesn't care.  Yeah.  It would be absolute premeditated murder.  Oh, he might go away forever.  Forever, really.  But you know what?  The hell he's going through, right now, prison would probably be like, oh, at least I got 
[02:19:30]  to kill that motherfucker.  Right.  To know that this fat fucking twat who killed his son was dead would probably be enough for  him.  Yeah.  And that he killed him.  It's like, I'm in prison, so what?  He'll probably get some mad fucking props in prison, too.  Yeah, he's a guy in jail, and I've never been there, but anybody who's been to prison  maybe, but he seems like a guy that nobody in prison would bother.  Yeah, it's like, hey, look at that.  If they knew why he was there.  Good job.  Good job, motherfucker.  But they say that the guy, you know, the kid killers don't do well in prison, man. 
[02:20:00]  No.  No, he probably hasn't.  Because even the rest of the guys in there all have families, so they understand it on  that level.  Rapists don't even do that well, supposedly, but these guys do worse.  Yeah, I hear the child murderers do.  They have a tough fucking time in prison.  They should put them right in general populations.  Absolutely.  Fuck protecting them.  That'd be great.  Why?  We protect.  We give them good behavior.  It's all lawyers.  It's all lawsuits.  It really is.  At least if you could go, all right, at least the guy got 40 years, it's some kind of victory.  But that's not even good, because now, like you said, it's down to 28 years, 29 years. 
[02:20:30]  He should never get out of jail, especially for attempting to murder the other one.  Like, why isn't he going to jail?  Maybe he should stay in jail for that.  Yeah.  It's fucking despicable.  But then again, you know what?  If these guys did so badly in jail, how did he survive 28 years?  Yeah.  Is there not one guy doing life plus 200 that could fucking take care of this problem?  Maybe he was unprotective.  Of course he was. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  How about some of you guys who are never getting out?  A lot of you are very naughty men.  Yeah.  I mean, that happened one time in jail.  Some guy who knew he was never getting out fucking killed the murderer of a five-year-old  girl, and the father thanked him and put money in his account.  But it wasn't that they didn't know each other.  He just rewarded him by putting money in his fucking...  That's what this guy should do.  Go, look, whoever kills this fucker, I'll take care of your family as much as I can on the  outside, whoever you got left on the outside.  Liza?  What about Liza? 
[02:21:30]  Wow.  Liza's skin green.  They just showed a video of her.  I swear they were filming her through a cinder block.  It was...  You could barely see her.  It was really overexposed and very blurry.  She doesn't look good.  No.  She looks old.  Yeah.  Well, she is, I think.  The problem is...  It gets to a point you can't dye her hair anymore.  That's a wig, isn't it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  She's too dark for her face.  She still has those pointy bang things that she had in Arthur. 
[02:22:00]  She's kind of royalty, though, isn't she?  Royalty.  Is she like Liza?  Gay guys love her, right?  Yeah, that's it.  She was older.  She's got her gays.  Gay guys love her, yeah.  The geek.  And who's that chick up top there?  Is that a New Yorker that's in Idol or some shit?  Yeah.  The girl.  She looks like the chick from Welcome to the Dollhouse.  She really does.  God, this story annoyed me so much.  Oh, look.  This is a shock, too.  Good, good.  You got the one?  Archdiocese of Philadelphia?  I was ready to go with it, man. 
[02:22:30]  It's...  I know this area, man.  There's a new lawsuit that just popped in Philadelphia.  Ooh.  And the Archdiocese of Philadelphia suspends 21 priests over sex abuse allegations.  20 more.  21 more.  Uh, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia suspended 21 priests on Tuesday after they were named  in a grand jury report released last month that alleged sexual abuse.  So these fuckers have been working for a really long time.  Of course.  21 more.  And how about what... 
[02:23:00]  Why?  21 more.  How about what you do is, if it's revealed that anybody in this shitty Catholic church  organization, knowingly in a position of power, kept someone who was a pedophile on, how about  they lose their tax-exempt status?  Oh, that's a good one.  How about that?  How about we have been...  Enough with the fucking church protecting these fucking people and moving them around  just because they don't want to lose their clout.  You might as well tax child molestation.  I couldn't agree more. 
[02:23:30]  Raise some money.  But you know what I mean?  It's like...  Yes.  I'm sick and fucking tired of the church just paying because they have the money.  And they just keep moving these guys.  I'm sick of my own outright...  My indignation, too.  Shut up.  No.  I don't have a gym.  It's good.  But what big risk I'm taking?  Molesters are banned.  News at six.  Yeah, bye-bye.  It's gotten to the point...  I brought up Catholic.  Every time I see a priest, I'm convinced they had to have touched a kid somewhere in the 
[02:24:00]  career.  Don't you think that?  That's how bad this has gotten.  Yeah.  I have no respect for any of them when I see them.  I don't trust...  Not a one.  A clergy.  Not a one at this point.  But you know...  And it's too bad because I'm sure there were guys that did the right thing.  But you'd see them and you'd always go, hello, Father.  I took them to dinner first or something.  Yeah.  Took them out for ice cream.  Right.  You're helping old altar boy, Father.  Father.  The exorcist, that was horrifying.  Here's the story.  Cardinal Justin Regali, the Archbishop of Philly, said the priests have been removed from ministry  while their cases are reviewed. 
[02:24:30]  These have been difficult weeks since the release of the grand jury report.  They're difficult, most of all, for victims of sexual abuse, but also for all the Catholics  and for everyone in our community.  The grand jury investigation spanned two years and resulted in charges against two priests,  a former priest and a Catholic school teacher.  They stand accused of raping young boys, reported the AP.  A former high-ranking church official was also accused of transferring problem priests to new parishes  without warning anyone of prior sex abuse complaints. 
[02:25:00]  There you go.  At the very least, you can't tell the people in the new area that this guy was touching kids?  Are you kidding me?  That is what they have been doing.  That's disgusting.  Forever.  Forever.  I'm so...  I fucking...  As much as I'm annoyed with radical Islam for their shit,  I am fucking completely fed up with the Catholic church.  The protection they have given these people over the years.  Like a sickening.  It's amazing.  When they find out they've been molesting children,  they just, yeah, yeah, we'll switch your location.  And the story ends with a blah-de-blah.  That's what I like to call these. 
[02:25:30]  Here's the blah-de-blah in this story.  Blah-de-blah.  I wish to express again my sorrow for the sexual abuse of minors committed by any members of the church,  especially clergy, said Regali.  I am truly sorry for the harm done to the victims of sexual abuse  as well as to the members of our community who suffer as a result of this great evil crime.  And that's why blah-de-blah.  Because that's all you hear.  Blah-blah.  Blah-de-blah.  How about some harsh words?  And how about the Pope comes out wearing whatever red slippers he's wearing for the day?  And instead of, you know, giving the apology,  how about he comes out continually talking about this and really harshly, 
[02:26:00]  how about he does that instead of sticking his fucking face in everybody's world affair business?  Yep.  How about he takes, instead of watching those wonderful Cirque du Soleil-like male dancers with no shirt,  he removes his red slippers or whatever slippers he has on  and begins really harshly and aggressively demanding fucking harsh and horrible punishments to these people?  Yeah.  I don't think you're going to see that. 
[02:26:30]  Look at his red slippers.  How about he takes off his red shoes?  How about his fucking Wizard of Oz?  Hey, Dorothy.  Hey, fucking Dorothy.  How about you address this instead of just riding around,  sticking your face in everybody's business?  His shoes, he looks like he should be saying,  Why didn't you call me, Tony?  You didn't call me.  I wasn't sure how far I wanted to go with this,  but my wife's checking in.  I know this story very well, by the way. 
[02:27:00]  It was her church, her family's church.  Ah, geez.  The priest was sent to our church, this is her words,  after he was caught diddling and then diddled at our church.  Oh, boy.  It's fucking disgusting.  Yeah.  So the priest ended her church, and no one knew, obviously.  But he was diddling somewhere else, that's why he ended up in their church.  Needle, needle, needle.  Yeah, it's well-known. 
[02:27:30]  This story is well-known in the community I hang out in Philly.  Well-known.  What a ghoul.  I bet he held penises and balls in his mouth and just made that noise.  Fucking creep.  Just creeps.  What is that?  Fucking organization of creeps.  The whole church, they're fucking creeps.  Look, they're showing a priest on TV right now.  I'm thinking, ah, he had to touch somebody.  You look at him, you're like, ah.  That's what I think now.  Every fucking time.  Big fat red face.  Fat red face.  Bloated alcohol face. 
[02:28:00]  I'm just tired of the whole organization.  That, how fucking, the Pope, with his arms up, it looks like he's fucking doing the Macarena.  Yeah.  And his white robe dress and his fucking red shoes.  I've had enough of him.  And I don't even know how to describe the guy next to him.  Gayer looking.  I don't even like talking to priests at all.  I can't stomach them.  I cannot stomach them.  Because to me, even if they're not molesters, they're just like gang members who didn't happen to shoot anybody. 
[02:28:30]  I had a christening recently.  I was two feet away from a priest or, I don't know, a clergyman, whatever he was.  And I didn't want to talk to the guy.  I'm like, no, we'll keep our distance.  And he might even be a really nice guy.  But you know what?  Sorry.  Not going to take the chance.  I think to enter the church, there's got to be something going on.  Right.  Because you've still got the poison inside you.  Sorry. 
[02:29:00]  There's got to just be something going on in there.  You are so troubled that you are looking for something else.  Whether it's denial of what you're liking, the guilt.  Is there some major problem that makes you want to sacrifice so much?  I don't get it.  And this doesn't really apply to nuns.  Because I just don't think that women are the sexual predators that men are. 
[02:29:30]  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  They're just not.  I think the nuns are just fucking, from what I heard, every time you hear nuns from school and stuff,  they're just nasty, fucking power-hungry, crazy bitches.  The whole organization.  I cannot look at anybody in the hierarchy of the church and have any respect for them.  None.  None.  And I mean all the way up to the Pope.  No respect for any of them or their morality or what they're doing.  Black their own.  Just how they handled it.  I mean, they, you know, to move these guys around. 
[02:30:00]  Well, what were they thinking?  That they were going to be cured if they moved them to another fucking church?  Yeah.  No, they were thinking they didn't care that kids were being fucked in the ass.  Like, how about, instead of them trying to make Pope John Paul II a saint, how about they fucking vilify his memory for not addressing this?  We're not doing anything about it.  That's a real saintly guy.  What miracles did he perform?  He made a kid's memories disappear by allowing a priest to be transferred to his district?  Yeah.  All right, enough of my self-righteous shit. 
[02:30:30]  Boring myself.  Forget it, Jim.  They're bad.  Fucking dullard.  And a Don Wicklin update.  How is she?  How is she?  Speaking of awful outfits like the Pope.  You know who Wiki reminds me before you read that?  The guy in Apocalypse Now who brought the dancers to the, when they were all dancing, and he just clapped his hands and he gave the thumbs up and dropped the flares.  Yeah, dropped the flares.  That's who he reminds me of.  Getting out of here.  That awful pleather jacket.  He writes, ain't that some shit?  I'm on my way to New York today, and I get hit with a shitload of emails and texts all of a sudden. 
[02:31:00]  Thanks for the props.  That's awesome of you guys.  Hopefully, we'll see you in a few.  Let's not hope so.  He's in Washington.  We're up here, though.  But he was good.  I couldn't believe that was Wicklin singing that one.  I'll step out of character.  That motherfucker was a soldier for us.  He was a good guy.  We love making fun of him because it's so fucking easy, but he was a soldier.  Piece of cake.  All right, Jimmy's tape next.  Please.  Jimmy has to tinkle.  That fucking pretty story, though.  It's just going to annoy me all day.  Because it's just innocent fucking kids that are pushed into the church. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, I thought you meant the blabbermouth.  Yeah.  Just innocents.  Yeah.  Taken away from them.  Well, someone's got to do it.  I know.  If it's not him, it'll be him in five years.  Five.  Well, they're almost legal, right?  Depending on the state.  That's right.  You know, I think everybody needs to relax and take a deep breath.  Stop judging everybody.  Good suggestion there, Uncle Paul. 
[02:32:00]  You don't know all the facts until they come out.  Why the anger?  Because I've been accused falsely.  Falsely?  How many times?  37.  37 false times?  They're a bunch of liars.  Oh, he was cupping my private area, putting saliva in his hand and going,  Sliver?  Shugger, shugger, shugger.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  I was not.  My hands are naturally clammy due to my diabetes medication. 
[02:32:30]  He stole something.  I was checking him.  You check a lot of people that you believe are thieves.  Yes, I do.  You ever find any stolen goods?  No, they're all so clever.  I hate thievery.  I don't like when people steal.  Yeah, because you keep checking these young children for stolen goods and they never steal anything.  Yeah, a bunch of, they're always hiding stuff, telling tall tales out of class. 
[02:33:00]  Whatever happened to keeping you, keep it quiet.  They can't keep secrets, those kids.  Nobody keeps secrets no more.  37?  No, I'm 57 years old.  No, I mean 37.  False accusations.  False accusations.  False ones, yeah.  There's been some other times the damn judge has had it out for me.  Oh, really?  Mr. Hargis, we found things on your computer. 
[02:33:30]  Who put them there?  I didn't.  I deleted everything.  Oh.  I didn't know you had to empty your trash.  Just pulls them to the trash.  Leaves his illegal pornography in the trash.  I would name them weird things, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like?  Hoppity Scotch.  That was the name of the folder.  No one's going to find that one.  That's what I thought. 
[02:34:00]  It's the first one they went to.  Hoppity Scotch.  What a bad folder name.  I didn't think they would know.  I would put the number five and then Y slash O after it.  Them cops are good.  They really did some investing.  I would use code words.  Not very good, though. 
[02:34:30]  I didn't know.  Not very good code.  I don't understand computers.  Fire, Y O.  Oh, shit.  What happened to a man's right to privacy?  Yeah.  I was doing research.  It worked for Pete Townsend.  I don't think it works for Paul Hargis.  Yeah, I told him.  I wanted to see how much of my own cum I could pull out in one afternoon.  Jesus.  With your normally clammy hands from your diabetes medicine.  The answer was a lot. 
[02:35:00]  The one, holy mackerel, that jump rope video got me crazy.  Did you label the folder jumpy ropey?  No, I put it J-R and in parentheses 2-8-Y-O.  2-8-Y-O.  That wasn't how many.  That was the age range. 
[02:35:30]  Ah, fuck, man.  Fucking great.  Jimmy.  You're so awful.  Oh, Paul.  I mean, yeah, Uncle Paul's going to make an appearance at Cobb's, I believe.  Yeah, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  San Francisco, they're much more understanding.  Yeah, they are.  Not about that, though.  Did you name Jimmy Cee-Dee, too?  Despicable?  I don't like that name.  I've been yelled at that.  People yelled at me when I was walking into the courtroom.  Despicable?  You're despicable. 
[02:36:00]  They would have yelled at me one time in the park.  Wow, really?  I was in the restroom collecting urine samples.  For what?  For what?  To see if anybody was eating too much candy.  Dr. Steve, my file trade partner, told me you can check for sugar that way.  Take that, stupid.  Yeah.  He's always talking about seepage.  He said, ah, Paul, we've got to get some seepage. 
[02:36:30]  I said, shut up.  I'll punch your glasses off.  Shut up and send that zip file.  Yeah, quiet and zip it up.  He would always check everybody's prostate.  That's what he does.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's good at that.  Got to make sure you're safe.  Yeah, yeah.  I kept trying to get me a job in your office.  He said, it's a goldmine in there.  He's not a pediatrician. 
[02:37:00]  Who's pediatrician?  He's lucky, that guy.  He gets the best gig.  Uncle Paul, a lot of people say you haven't had a birthday in a while.  That you've been 57.  Yeah, tell them they're lying.  They don't know nothing.  I'll be 58 in March.  Oh, we're in March.  I know.  What day?  In March the 18th.  57 years young.  Age is only a number.  That's right.  You're as young as you feel. 
[02:37:30]  That's right.  Or whoever you're feeling.  That's young, right?  Yeah, it sure is.  Oh, that Uncle Paul.  Cribs.  I saw MTV Cribs.  I was so disappointed.  I thought it was pornography.  Who are all these blacks with fancy cars?  I don't know who this is. 
[02:38:00]  Snooping doggies.  All I got the guns.  What are they doing?  Wouldn't have happened when I was young.  No, huh?  Yeah.  I got to go to the bathroom.  Yeah, why don't you go pee-pee?  We'll play Jim Norton's embarrassing tape next.  Yes, I want to hear that.  And going to break, I think Bill Burr does a little something on going to church.  Oh.  Want to hear this? 
[02:38:30]  Sure.  All right.  I realize, man, I've been real empty lately.  I never go to church, man.  I'll get to be honest.  I hate church.  I always couldn't stand it when I was growing up.  Yeah, there's a couple other people going to hell with me.  Yeah, there you go.  No.  You know what it is?  I grew up Catholic.  I used to sit there in the crowd, you know, listening to the priest.  The priest, they were like preaching.  They didn't even sound like they believed it.  They'd just be up there.  This is the gospel, according to Luke.  All right?  I'm not saying it happened.  I'm not saying it didn't happen, all right?  I'm just saying what Luke said. 
[02:39:00]  Now, according to Luke, the dude got out of the boat.  He started walking across the water.  Ah, sounded crazy to me.  I don't know if he was a drinker.  You know, don't get mad at me.  I'm just repeating what Luke said.  No, I definitely, I believe in a higher power.  But I think when people just get too under religion, they get crazy.  Like, I like people that get so into it that they actually, like, argue, like, what color Jesus is.  You know what I mean?  Which is hilarious.  It's like one of the most unholy things you could ever do, right? 
[02:39:30]  They'll sit down and be like, you know, Jesus, he's for everybody.  Rich people, poor people.  He doesn't care.  He's just, he's just a great spirit.  Everything's great.  Oh, yeah?  What color is he?  He's white.  He looks like me.  We're unchosen people.  You know?  Or some of my, uh, some of my black friends try to convince me that Jesus was black. 
[02:40:00]  You know, he had that nappy head, all this stuff, you know?  It's the dumbest thing to argue about.  I really don't give a shit what color Jesus is.  I just don't want him to be mad at me when he comes back.  That's my deal.  I don't care what he is when he comes back on that seven-headed horse, chopping people's heads off, whatever the hell it is.  I just want when he rides by me, you know, just give me one of these.  Make me feel good about my life, you know?  The opening of the show of The Virus, Sirius XM. 
[02:40:30]  What song is this?  It's good.  Hey?  This is, uh, Doomsday Check by Smashing Pumpkins.  I hate the pumpkins.  Hey, did you have a good, uh, Fat Tuesday?  Oh, Jesus.  I did not celebrate it, no.  Oh, Eric.  Oh.  Oh.  It's Fat Tuesday.  What's today?  Today we put the ashes on our head. 
[02:41:00]  Ash Wednesday.  Is that today?  A bunch of people walk around, you go like, what the fuck?  Oh, that's right.  You never know it's Ash Wednesday until you see a few people with the ashes.  At first you're just like, what the fuck is going on?  Has he got the Gorbachev thing going?  And then you realize, ah, Ash Wednesday.  Ah.  Before we get to Jimmy's tape.  Oh, my God.  The listeners just heard that and went, what the fuck?  No, really, just really fast, because it's a big sports story.  Tiki Barber is coming back to play football.  Is he crazy?  He will not play for the Giants.  He's 36 years old.  I think he retired four years ago. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  People that know sports better than I, which is most of you.  Retired about four years ago?  Is it four years ago?  He's coming back, and everyone is thinking, what the fuck?  And I tweeted yesterday, it's alimony.  This guy's getting fucked in his divorce.  Slammed.  He left his pregnant wife, which makes the wife even more angry if you're going to be divorced.  So she's not going to let you off lightly to begin with.  And then she knows that you left for an intern while she was pregnant. 
[02:42:00]  She's going to make it really hurt.  Yeah.  Wow.  And that's why he's coming back to football.  The guy's broke.  And he's hoping that maybe a team out there will go, ah, what the hell.  We'll take a chance on Tiki Barber.  Poor son of a bitch.  And they'll get a few million out of it.  Poor bastard.  That's why he's doing this.  It's obvious.  Are the sports stations saying this?  I don't think so.  23-year-old intern.  Which ended up blowing up his gig, right? 
[02:42:30]  He had a nice cushy gig.  Nice cush gig.  Cush gig.  Yeah.  Do that.  He's got a divorce going on if it's not finalized.  I don't know.  And now he has to come back because he's broke.  36.  That's...  Not many 36-year-old running backs in the NFL.  He's got to go back on the battlefield.  Mm-hmm.  Just to make a few bucks.  Damn.  Everyone's saying a sequel will be a disaster.  Of course it will.  So just a quickie because that's a big story today, too. 
[02:43:00]  Good luck to you.  Tiki.  Good luck, bro.  Oh.  Jimmy, what's this tape about?  We're about to listen to it.  Oh, yes.  It's good.  I hear it's really good.  It's my first...  It probably is.  ...TV appearance.  Oh.  First TV appearance.  And what was the show?  Featuring Cunts.  Starring me.  It was Friday Night Videos.  Friday Night Videos.  I remember that show. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, it's fucking embarrassing.  I might have watched this.  I'll put the video up.  I just haven't done it yet.  Oh.  You're rubbing your face.  That can only mean that you're really proud of your work.  I wish I had a gun to rub it with.  This is truly embarrassing.  Why?  It just is.  It was good enough for TV.  That's where I get confused.  I know, but a lot of things are good enough.  Charlie Sheen is good enough for TV.  You've seen some stand-ups on TV.  Yeah, dude.  I'm so...  Yeah, but you see that they're polished and doing something.  Yeah?  It might not be your...  Cup of Joe? 
[02:44:00]  I was going to say that, but I know I say that a lot.  It might not be your taste or whatever.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  All right, let's listen to this from Friday Night Videos.  Friday Night Videos.  Friday Night Videos.  Jimmy.  What year is this, Jimmy?  1996.  Anything we should be looking for?  Yes.  Thank you.  Bad jokes.  Pause the place.  Oh, good.  How are you?  How are you?  What are you doing?  Wait a minute.  Your legs are very close and tight together, like you're almost clenching your butt cheeks. 
[02:44:30]  Yes, I am.  And you're rocking on your heels a little and arching backwards and forwards.  Yes, I am.  And clapping your hands like, well, yeah, yeah.  Yes, I am.  All right.  I'm doing all of those things.  I just wanted to make sure I had it correct.  Excellent confirmation job.  I'm doing all of those things.  All right.  I was trying to be likable and comfortable.  Oh, well, it's coming across fine.  I like you.  A quirky character.  A little quirky.  But I was, by this point, like you heard the 93 tape, which is worse. 
[02:45:00]  By this point, three years later, I was getting out of it, but I wasn't out yet.  Yeah, yeah.  It takes you a while to find out.  We're still trying to find your voice.  It really is that.  A little character thing.  Not comfortable in your own skin up on stage, was it?  You had to put on a little.  There's got to be a better way to say that.  I hear that so many times, especially with stand-up comics.  I actually was watching a documentary on Bill Hicks last night, and they were explaining  when he finally found his voice.  Do you like when they say that?  I don't like the expression, but I get what it means. 
[02:45:30]  But you understand what it means.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It just seems like there's a better way to say that, but whatever.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  I feel good, man.  I'm in a great mood.  I feel sexy.  I feel sexy.  Wasn't a joke, but thank you for laughing.  I want it to look sexy, because it's my first TV taping, and there'd be some hot women here,  and I want it to look good, you know, so I ran out and spent $15 on a haircut that I could  have gotten for free in a mental institution.  This is horrifying, isn't it?  This is awful.  I grew up with a...  She can't even look at it. 
[02:46:00]  Look at this.  Why can't anybody is the question.  She fucked me up when she went, woo!  Oh, that got you?  Yeah, because the joke would kill.  The opening joke would kill.  $15 on a haircut that I could have gotten for freedom of mental stuff.  Yeah.  And she went, woo!  And just...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was Conan's old studio in New York.  Well, she did.  Was Woody Allen an influence?  Yeah, very much so.  Can you see it in this?  I never saw that, but you might be right. 
[02:46:30]  Slightly, I think.  Maybe.  Might be misreading it.  I love Woody.  Not copying, but...  Right.  Oh, yeah, it's very possible, dude.  A bit of his cadence.  Oh, I never even noticed.  Hmm.  My father, which is why I got this.  And I hated that, because my father was a drunk, and he was a very embarrassing...  What happened there?  ...man to be around, because he would take me and my mother out and introduce us to people.  It was like, this is my wife, and this is my son, and this is for fighting, this is for fun.  And he was scary. 
[02:47:00]  My father was very scary, because he would have Vietnam flashbacks, which was horrifying,  because he was never there.  Could you pause for a minute?  One time, he threw me up again.  What's with the little snicker laugh thing?  I like it.  It lets you know that you're kind of like, this is new to me, too, people.  I don't know what I'm saying.  You know, if he wasn't there, I just heard this myself. 
[02:47:30]  You know what would be great?  I wish cum would just shoot out of your mic and into your face, as do you.  I think that's the Woody Allen thing, though.  Woody Allen would...  Yeah, a little snicker.  Maybe.  It's a nervous energy.  He would trail off after his punchlines, didn't he?  Woody?  Woody.  Woody?  Woody?  Woody?  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  Let's play the tape.  The wall.  He said, do you know what I went through in 1967? 
[02:48:00]  Canadian customs?  Take your time with that.  Thank you for laughing.  Those that didn't, you know, did we fight Canada?  I love the high voice thing.  And the problem, let's get back to my head.  The problem with it is it doesn't look good on me.  My father looks great.  He has a crew cut, the handsome, sturdy, military face.  Women love my dad.  But they don't.  That's why I screwed up.  I don't have a handsome, sturdy, military type of face. 
[02:48:30]  No?  I have a little fat baby face.  You do.  It sucks.  I am not sexy.  A little crew cut, a little fat baby face.  A little crew cut.  Look at the bastard son of Sinead O'Connor and Uncle Fester.  Pause a minute.  It killed my god.  I love the son of, and then you add two people together.  The combo?  Yeah.  It killed, though.  It killed.  It killed.  It did.  At the time, that was.  It's 15 years ago, so I'll forgive myself for that. 
[02:49:00]  Yes, yes.  I was waiting for an on steroids punchline.  On steroids.  On crack.  Well, my baby face and my hair.  The material, I don't mind as much as the voice and the behavior.  Yeah, yeah, that's what it is.  Primitive material is whatever.  Right.  It was for the, you know, for the time, it was, you know, fine.  But, yeah, that high voice thing, it's cute.  I know. 
[02:49:30]  I look young, too, don't I?  I hate that.  I'm 27 years old.  I look like a little boy.  It's just the last woman that took me to bed tucked me in.  That's funny.  That's not good.  That's funny.  I just want to stay home and watch films.  You want to see good movies?  Forget the stuff that's out now.  Watch the stuff from, like, the 1940s.  Best movies ever done.  Why?  Because they couldn't curse on camera.  They couldn't.  So they had to show, like, their anger and annoyance by overacting.  They were great movies.  Watch one of them.  Every time they get aggravated, they wouldn't curse. 
[02:50:00]  They would just go, that's in the 40s.  It's the 1990s.  That is still the best thing to do in a bar.  If a woman rejects you, it throws her right off track.  Hey, baby, can I buy you a drink?  Oh, hey, baby.  Is that what you do in a bar, by the way?  Is that what you did, Jimmy?  Hey, baby, can I buy you a drink?  Baby, can I buy you a drink?  Good line.  Hey, baby. 
[02:50:30]  Believe it or not, I have had a lot of practice dealing with rejection.  Oh.  No, I have.  You know why?  And don't pretend you didn't notice.  You're a nice, polite crowd.  I have a tiny little chin, don't I?  Look at this.  I hate it.  I have the profile of a frog.  I had a commercial audition today.  One line.  Bud.  I just hate my head.  I tried to grow a goatee.  It slid off.  It's not fair, man. 
[02:51:00]  Even the elephant man had a chin.  All right, granted, it was on the back of his head.  I'm proud of that one.  That's funny.  You guys are good.  It's okay to laugh.  He's not here.  And I'm sorry.  But when your head is that big and fat, you deserve to stand in a cage while British children  throw pebbles at you.  British kids were great.  They were ruthless.  Look at him.  He's got a big egg.  Pow.  Pow.  You're doing characters.  I am not an animal.  Yeah, well, you're not Mel Gibson either.  Pow. 
[02:51:30]  Oh.  You sounded like Catherine Hepburn.  Can you tell me I am so hyper right now.  I drank like six cups of coffee backstage.  I feel like I'm talking like a Donald's hamburger tonight.  You're not Mel Gibson either.  Have the loans.  Oh, Jimmy.  I like the accent, which you have lost.  Yeah, what is that?  The accent is creeping me out.  Was it?  Yeah, no, Mel Gibson either.  Oh, that was, I was doing it in a British children's voice.  No, no, no.  I know.  Just overall, I could hear more of an accent that you don't have anymore.  Oh.  I thought you were from England. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  That's what I tried to do.  I tried to make it an organic experience for everybody.  Jimmy is like cringing here.  It's not that bad.  The voice is a little high.  It's not the material that bothers me.  Yeah, yeah.  It's literally, I actually like the fact that I was talking about making fun of the elephant  man.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the, the voice is very odd.  Yeah.  I can't help you get to me.  Your speaking voice wasn't that, you should put this out on.  It was despicable.  I'm going to.  No, I'm going to put it on the line or something. 
[02:52:30]  Okay, like a, like a, like a hidden track or something.  Do you like my belt?  Well, it's the outfit of the times.  No, you were just.  A tucked in mock turtle neck.  That's how people dressed.  Look like Steve Jobs.  Look like Steve Jobs.  Yeah.  He's got the same gene.  I wish I would have born Apple back then.  No wonder women don't like me.  It is not sexy to be this hyper on a date.  You know, hi, how are you?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Get away from me.  I look like Cousin Inn after chemotherapy.  You know.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, God. 
[02:53:00]  I would love to make love to a woman who is just as hyper as I am.  That would be worth filming.  You know, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I can't sleep.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I am so lonely.  Any hookers here?  No, I don't get hookers.  I don't understand in this day and age why is prostitution illegal.  What is prostitution?  It's paying somebody for sex. 
[02:53:30]  That's against the law.  Now, pornography is totally legal, and what is that?  It's paying somebody for sex and then showing it to the world.  What the hell is the difference?  So if you're going to get hookers, take my advice, bring a video camera.  This way if the police kick in your door and yell,  What the hell is going on in there?  You can just jump back and yell,  Cut!  I want to talk about something that's important.  I was almost killed today.  This is true.  I was cut off. 
[02:54:00]  Thank you for laughing at that.  I almost killed my ribs.  I was cut off by a tractor trailer.  Now, I have an airbag in my car.  A driver's side airbag.  And you are a windbag.  It is such a hazard to have it.  Because when you have an airbag, your horn is not where it's supposed to be, is it?  Right?  It's not in the middle of the steering wheel where it's been for 80 years.  And that's where you need it when there's a truck coming.  You want the horn right there.  You know, you drive it.  Truck!  Bonk, bonk!  You don't have that with an airbag. 
[02:54:30]  You have these little crappy rectangular horns up in the corner.  What the hell is that?  It's not a horn.  It's a chiclet.  And it's not the same when there's a truck coming.  It's like, truck!  That's funny.  It's so true.  In two seconds, my car has a G-spot and I can't find the damn thing.  Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jim Norton.  Thank you very much.  Is it?  Ladies and gentlemen.  Ladies and gentlemen.  If you enjoyed being here half as much as I've enjoyed performing, you've enjoyed this twice as much as me. 
[02:55:00]  Thank you.  I liked it.  Do you get an interview after that?  Why is there more time on this tape?  There is an interview.  But I think we've played that already at one point.  But that's true.  One app.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I remember this.  Yeah, it felt good.  It was just, it takes a little bit to get used to, like, looking up at the audience as opposed to looking straight ahead like in a comedy club.  It's kind of sounds smart.  I had a hard time.  They were great.  Good.  It wasn't too hard, huh?  No, no.  It was good.  You just can't curse.  You've got to, like, edit yourself.  You're so baby-faced. 
[02:55:30]  Well, how long have you been doing stand-up?  About five years.  You're trying to be very likable.  That's not very long then?  No, I started when I was 21.  I was working in a warehouse, and I just, I always wanted to do comedy.  You know, Richard Pryor, 1980, I wanted to do, I have a plug, Pryor, if he's watching.  Which I know he is.  I wanted to do comedy since I saw him.  Oh, even Danny had a look down on that one.  Failing at school, getting thrown out, and winning Class Clown, and the whole nine years.  Oh, well, did you win? 
[02:56:00]  Overwhelming.  Other than scholastics to work for.  Okay.  Well, what do you like most about doing stand-up?  What are you doing?  Why are you, why are you?  Quick fix, John.  You know immediately if you're doing well.  I'm being a cunt.  Yeah, why are you being like this?  Because I'm an asshole.  And it was my first interview, I think.  Was it?  That might be the first interview I've ever heard.  Because you could be, like, um, saying funny things.  Allegedly, that happens during interviews.  But I felt it was time to really be smart and likable. 
[02:56:30]  I was thin back then, too.  You are very thin.  And we're looking at a very thin Jim Norton.  And, uh, you're very, uh, fresh-faced.  Yeah.  Who's interviewing you?  Young little whippersnapper.  One of the co-hosts.  Mm-hmm.  And they showed the interviews from the other guys on the show, but they never showed mine.  Yeah.  Oh, why?  Oh.  No, I...  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  You were taking...  It was like you're on fucking, uh, a political talk show. 
[02:57:00]  It's called being a bore.  Barry was my manager when I did this.  Barry Katz.  Oh, was it?  Barry.  Someone's saying that that exact hooker with Cameron versus porno, uh, bit was just on Family Guy.  Really?  Which, obviously, you did it a long time ago.  Or the Cleveland show.  This guy forgot.  I'm wondering if it was close.  We've actually done that joke recently, but obviously much more subdued. 
[02:57:30]  Ripping you off.  And without all the, uh, you know...  Hoo-hoo, ripping you off.  This sounds more like the Jimmy we know, by the way.  This interview.  Just your voice and stuff.  Well, the voice is, yeah.  Put on voice, so...  Let's see the end of this.  Immediately if you're bombing.  Whereas, I guess, with acting or anything else, uh, which is another type of a skill, you don't know until it's released.  I like that because I want to know now how I'm doing.  So, fuck acting.  Um, being judged by an audience. 
[02:58:00]  I don't even mind bombing.  I mean, I don't mind that, but I hate when, like, you tell a joke and a crack goes, uh...  The heckling and that kind of...  Yeah, or if they're judging a joke.  It's like, if you don't think it's funny, don't laugh, but don't groan at me because you know you're going to go home and write Scarface anyway.  And it's a tough thing to do, so they shouldn't be judging you.  Well, yeah, I mean, if you don't like something, I can accept that.  I just don't like being, uh, you know...  You got it.  I got what you say.  Say it again.  She goes, I got what you say.  Yeah, right.  Try to get it from my own experience.  If not, I'll just watch Comedy Central and steal.  Don't do that. 
[02:58:30]  I'm kidding.  Now, if you weren't a stand-up comedian, what do you think you'd be doing for a living?  I was in a warehouse before, and, uh, probably that.  I'm very lucky.  You know, I'm very grateful to, uh, to be where I am right now.  Where are you?  I don't know what I'd be doing, to be honest with you.  I don't know what I wanted to do since I was a kid, so it's either this or nothing.  Right.  Well, you're on the right track.  Thank you.  Good luck to you.  Thanks.  Thanks for being here.  Appreciate it.  Okay.  The smile.  Very good, Jim.  Thanks.  Okay.  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Can you hear the little, little sniffle after you?  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Very good, Jim. 
[02:59:00]  Good.  Thank you.  Let's do it.  Both of you are under arrest for prostitution.  It's not prostitution.  You paid her to have sex.  No, I paid her to have sex, and we're filming it.  So, technically, it's not prostitution.  It's a porno.  Oh.  Well, as long as you're filming and selling it, it's legal.  Well, enjoy your day.  Remember, kids, she's not a whore if she's an...  Well, that's the end of the clip.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to thank the other Lizzie on Twitter.  That's great.  Same bitch.  That's the same fucking joke, Jimmy.  Yeah, 15 years earlier. 
[02:59:30]  Which you did 15 years earlier.  So, you're on to something.  I love the little voice.  Yeah.  It's just hideous.  Kind of sound like a progeria kid.  Yeah, I sound like...  My name should be Seashell Boy.  Seashell Boy.  Why Seashell?  I don't know, because I'm talking like a little seashell.  Do you have my...  Wow, that's the same fucking bit, though, huh?  It is, yeah.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, that is the same bit. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, God.  That's funny.  We should do one more break and then finish the show.  What do you say?  Make love?  Sure, sure.  Jimmy's going to be at Cobb's.  He leaves tomorrow, I guess.  I'll be on...  I won't be here tomorrow or Friday.  Boo!  Oh, Jimmy.  My CD is out today.  I'll be on Red Eye tonight.  I'm doing Red Eye.  Ooh.  Yeah, it's been a while, so hopefully it'll go well.  It will go well.  I hope...  From your lips to God's.  I'll be doing Red Eye on the 18th.  Really?  After Hannity on the 17th. 
[03:00:30]  So it's an Anthony kind of Thursday and Friday.  It's a ratings wash for the network.  Really?  Who couldn't they get?  Somebody apparently canceled two nights in a row.  Two nights in a row.  Maybe 40 nights or something.  Ouch.  The phone's not being answered.  What the fuck is she doing?  Lady Trucker just sucks.  Why?  I don't know what the problem is today.  What's the problem?  What is she saying?  What phones aren't being answered? 
[03:01:00]  I have no idea.  Just by calling fucking McDonald's.  McDonald's.  I just couldn't think of a food place.  I went with McDonald's.  I could have done better.  No, it's fine.  McDonald's.  Gets the point across.  Fat fucking slob.  McDonald's.  Sure not drinking milkshakes down there at McDonald's.  I could assure you.  Yeah.  How do I get a verified badge for my Twitter stat? 
[03:01:30]  I was listening and going like, I want to be verified.  It's tough now for some reason.  It used to be easy and now it's tough to do.  It can't be that tough.  No, I'm serious.  They stopped doing it for a while or made it harder or something.  Yeah, I know because there's a lot of people that weren't able to do it.  But I tried recently.  There was some weird thing you had to do.  Oh, Travis is telling me Bobby Kelly is verified.  Yeah, but that was before they put in new rules or something.  I don't know how you do it is the answer, Jimmy. 
[03:02:00]  Verified fat.  Bobby knows I love him.  I know, but it was just, you could have went with something meaner even.  Verified hippopotamus.  I was going to say verified retard, but he's smart.  He's not a dummy.  He's not smart.  He is dumb.  No, he knows a lot of things about technical stuff.  I like that.  Bobby's on the cutting edge with the technology.  Attention-seeking fatso, are you there? 
[03:02:30]  Please, I want to hear truck tires skidding.  I want to hear that, that deep sound, that, and then just hear like the carnage of metal  twisting, hitting concrete.  Oh, those jumping tires and the fucking pneumatic thing going. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, where the cops have to come out with that wheel measuring thing to see how long the  fucking skid marks are, and they're like, wow, right into an abutment.  Oh.  Hi, lady trucker.  This tire is skidding.  That's skipping tire skid.  Would you like that?  Oh, the last thing she sees is her taillights on the trailer passing her on the fucking 
[03:03:30]  side of the cab.  And it's because they built a big wall right on Route 80 for no reason.  Don't you have an icy highway to get to?  Please.  Yeah.  Increasing the odds.  Why aren't you on icing road trucker?  See, because she's fat.  Icing.  They don't make a cake big enough. 
[03:04:00]  They can hold me.  Oh, that's right.  Just more attention.  Oh, boy.  I blew it.  Hey, do you go through shocks on the left side of your truck faster?  Just want to know.  Got to get new tires for the left side.  Constantly.  Do the mudflap scrape on the driver's side?  Hey, do you put all, like, candy and stuff in your truck? 
[03:04:30]  Is it full, like, of marmalades?  Shit.  Oh, shit.  Marmalades.  Chip, guess what my favorite shop...  Oh, damn it.  I fucked it up.  That's okay.  I'm sure I would have if you didn't.  You said, damn it, I fucked it up.  You fucked it up as soon as we said hello.  Oh, I just want to ask Chip, what do you think my favorite cookies are?  Your favorite cookies?  Um, I don't know, but I hope you're eating them when you're paralyzed. 
[03:05:00]  That's just mean, Chip.  I hope the nurse has to feed them to you when you're shitting into a bag and your family  won't come to talk to you or something.  Oh, something.  Yeah.  I hope you're eating cookies after your whole body is burned in a fire and you have to eat  them through thin, burned lips.  Or something.  Something like that.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Fire.  Lips.  When you, um, when you pull up to the truck scales, do they think you're hauling the sun?  Yeah, or the moon. 
[03:05:30]  Chip.  Say, I do want to fly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is the sun heavy?  I would think the sun's pretty heavy.  No, that could be misinterpreted because the sun is also hot.  Oh, that's right.  No, they wouldn't.  How about this?  When you pull up to a truck stop, do they think you're hauling Jupiter's weight but in shit?  I'm sorry, Lady Trucker.  That's perfect.  She's nice to me.  Is she?  Yeah, I fucked her.  Jesus.  Oh! 
[03:06:00]  Are we done with this, Lady Trucker?  Yes, we're done.  All right.  Did you guys see the...  Oh, they stopped verifying Twitter?  You're right, Ope.  I don't...  They're not doing it anymore?  But why do they stop verifying?  It's because people know it's you.  Now they do it for just special, special people.  Like when Charlie Sheen hit the Twitter, they said, yeah, all right, we'll verify you.  Well, we're special.  I thought so.  I thought so, too.  Hey, did you see the video Rogan tweeted about how insignificant and small we actually are?  Danny would...  You saw that video, right, Danny? 
[03:06:30]  He means us as a show.  Humans and Earth and how small Earth really is.  Yeah, I've seen size comparison.  Like where it goes down from an atom all the way to like a huge...  But the planet where they said if a plane was flying 744 miles, it would take thousands and  thousands of years to make one circle.  Did you see this video?  It will fucking creep you out.  Wait, wait.  If a plane was flying where?  I need the video because now I'm just making it up.  Planes fly at about 500 miles an hour. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, but...  544.  For this example, they said 700 miles an hour or something.  If it flew to where, though?  Just made one circle around this big, huge fucking mast.  Oh, it would take like two hours.  Oh, Joe tweeted this a while ago, so we might have luck on YouTube just kind of doing a general  search.  As soon as I see the video...  I'm not sure what to search for.  I know, I know.  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  Someone tweeted to us real fast, one of us, or on PalTalk.  The PalTalk guys saw it, eh? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  We need help.  Meh.  Meh.  Starts with Earth, and it just shows you all the other big shit.  Looking, searching, scanning.  And they did it in such a way it was pretty impressive.  I'm not gay.  What happened?  Talking to myself.  These people have no clue.  Is that the inner fight you have?  No.  No one has a clue.  They all follow Rogan. 
[03:08:00]  They saw this video.  Yeah, but...  Another dead end.  I'm sorry, boys.  Kevin Nelson.  I'm sorry.  Well, what happened?  Oh, they're saying if a plane flew around Bob Kelly, it would take...  Well, that's what I was thinking.  We could get some jokes.  Oh, God.  Kevin Nelson.  We've got to find the video.  Those comparisons are very...  No, no, no.  Go, go.  I'm sorry.  It's just funny.  It made me laugh.  I'm sorry.  On Jupiter, when Comet Shoemaker-Levy hit, they said that there's a  big mark where it hit, a black spot, and they said that's the size of the Earth. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How small the Earth is.  You could fit 1,000 Earths in Jupiter and 1,000 Jupiters in the Sun.  Yeah, Jupiter's part of this thing, but it gets way bigger than Jupiter.  Oh, that's why I want to show the people, and no one could fucking help me out.  Our Sun is even small.  And I'll tweet it.  I'll give Rogan the credit, but it's an amazing video to check out.  I'm going to guess it's a star, by the way, that the thing would fly around.  Probably not a planet, a star.  And I do know Danny would appreciate it.  I'm sure I've seen things like this before.  Is it Bethelgis?  That's the star's name or whatever it is? 
[03:09:00]  Size of the universe.  Bethelgis.  I mean, there's a bunch of these things floating around.  Some are like our animations.  Some are like Flash animations.  Nah, it's not that one.  I want a guy with a ruler.  It was really filmed great.  Let me go to Glenn, who wants to bust your balls at.  Glenn.  Oh, what happened?  Hey, Crash.  Hey, Crash.  How's that Mustang of yours?  Wishing my fat lady trucker friend to be crashing her truck.  It's something like yours did when you wiped that fucking $100,000 fucking little pup boy of yours up. 
[03:09:30]  Why are you mad at that, man?  No one likes Lady Trucker.  I know, but I do.  She's a fellow truck driver.  Dude.  Your phone's breaking up.  What?  You heard me.  Fucking, if we haven't had an update on your car, what's up with the car?  I can't hear this guy.  No.  Can anyone hear him?  No.  Yes.  You said we haven't had an update on your car.  We'd like an update on your car.  Dang.  Being fixed, asshole. 
[03:10:00]  Shut up.  Star size comparison on YouTube.  It's the title.  Star size?  I give it to Willem Dafoe first.  And then fucking Jet Li last.  I got it right here.  Yeah.  I can't play it on this thing.  Sweetie, why?  I don't know.  Is it flesh?  I just don't know why.  It's the flesh.  Is it the motherfucking flesh?  I think it's the flesh.  I read about a star so big one time, they said if a snail was skipping, it would take  2,437,000 parsecs to get around it. 
[03:10:30]  Parsecs.  It's definitely star size comparison is the title.  Yeah.  Can we find it?  Star size comparison.  Now I'm curious.  Star size comparison.  Yeah.  It's worth tweeting later because the visuals just will creep you out.  I think that's the one.  Let's talk about size.  A little very spacey kind of music.  How big are the objects floating in our universe and how big can they get? 
[03:11:00]  I don't know.  Enjoy the following comparison starting with quite a big object, our own moon.  It starts with the moon.  There's the moon.  Then it goes to Mercury.  Mercury is a very small planet.  Yes.  But bigger than the moon.  Mars.  Venus.  And then our own blue marble, Earth.  Yes.  We're here.  Yay.  So we're thinking, all right, that's a good size.  Oh, my God.  Neptune's giant.  Neptune just kicks our ass.  Saturn?  Then it goes to Saturn.  So big. 
[03:11:30]  Without rings.  And then Jupiter's just a ridiculous fucking...  Oh, my God.  And look at our sun.  It's giant.  And then we get to Sirius A, which is way bigger than the sun.  And then this Pollux orange giant just dwarfs everything until you get to the red giant,  which is way fucking bigger.  Arcturus.  And then you get to the other red giant, Altamaran, which is crazy.  There's other ones that are way bigger than these.  Yeah.  And then the blue super giant. 
[03:12:00]  And then the pistol star just kicks its ass.  And Terry's there, right?  The red super giant.  I'm getting afraid.  Yeah.  It'll bring it back to the size of Earth in a second.  Because they just get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.  The largest known star.  It's a little hyper giant.  It's all active.  So then you move on from the largest star.  Yeah.  And then it'll show.  That's the size of Earth.  You can't see it.  That's a speck.  Here it is. 
[03:12:30]  This star is a diameter of about what?  2,800,000, 2,000, 2,800,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers.  Can you imagine?  Think of a passenger airplane flying along the surface of this star at 900 kilometers per hour.  It would take 1,100 years to circle it one time.  Oh, wow.  I hope I'd be in first class.  I'd hate to do that flight in coach.  Imagine being stuck between two fat people on that flight.  Yet it is only a tiny dot among several hundred billion stars forming our galaxy. 
[03:13:00]  Forming the galaxy.  Yeah.  And then, of course, 100 billion galaxies out there.  There's 100 billion galaxies?  Wow.  So stop thinking that we're the only life form, please.  Wow.  Isn't that fucked up?  That's scary.  Dude, I didn't realize there was a hundred billion.  Huh?  I didn't know there was a hundred fucking billion galaxies.  Like, I knew there was a couple billion.  I thought there were a few. 
[03:13:30]  A few?  Like five or six?  I would say several.  Yeah, a few or several.  I didn't know it went into the billions.  Didn't you always hate several?  Yeah.  Well, how many is it?  Depends.  If it was blowjobs, no.  If it was rectal cancer polyps, yes.  Didn't we all agree a few was three because it was a couple and then you went from a couple  to a few?  A few.  So you're like, it's three.  And they're like, no, it's not. 
[03:14:00]  It's a few.  I hate vagaries when it comes to numbers.  Me too.  Several.  Vagaries make me feel just vague.  Kind of like, I don't know.  Because it sounds almost like vagaries, which are delicious.  I was going to tweet that, but fuck it.  Here's how evil Dr. Steve is.  Oh, real fast.  That video that obviously is a much better visual than an audio thing is on our Facebook  page, Opie and Anthony.  So go there now if you want to see what we just played for ourselves. 
[03:14:30]  I like the music.  It was frightening.  It was from that guy.  That guy that does that type of music.  Oh, Mickey Tetlefortz.  That's right.  Tetlefortz.  Yes, Anne.  Dr. Steve writes, goddamn lady trucker death jokes never get old.  That shit is laugh out loud funny.  So why is the other trucker getting involved?  Dr. Steve doesn't like lady trucker.  Well, that trucker had to stick up for a fellow trucker.  Come on, man.  You guys make fun of yourselves, too.  You could jump in on the fun there. 
[03:15:00]  No.  Well, the guy was actually making a legitimate point.  What was the point?  About the car.  You know, I'm bitching at lady trucker making jokes, but I'm the one that smashed my  car into a car.  Yeah, there you are.  You live in a glass house, and when you're over there doing what?  Throwing Windex.  Throwing Mustangs or something.  Yes.  You shouldn't throw Mustangs if you live in a glass car housing place.  Wow.  Wow.  Garage?  What's that?  What's that?  Oh, garages are cool, yeah. 
[03:15:30]  My band plays in them.  Burning embers.  Burning embers, right.  Burning.  Not burning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it on the drums?  Do you have it written on the drums?  The marker.  It's just in Sharpie.  You got my love, and I got your love, we got each other's love.  That's a great song.  You got my love, I got your love, we got each other's love. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  I like it.  It's got a good melody.  Yeah, that's good.  That's the title, too.  I got your love?  I got your love, you got my love, we got each other's love.  Any other words?  There's other lyrics.  Let me hear them.  What are you going to do, sing for free?  How about you pay me?  Sorry, Chip.  What, you fucking broke all of a sudden buying booze?  Yeah.  I got a new keg.  I got a new keg.  I don't sing for you for free. 
[03:16:30]  New keg of what?  Piss cum?  Piss cum.  That's what it was.  Piss cum.  Holy shit.  We tried doing one, it was like a fun one for weddings and stuff.  We're going to do chip, chip, chip to maloo, but nobody ever...  Chip, chip, chip to maloo?  Just for weddings, to get people dancing.  Yeah, that would get them dancing, all right.  We played one wedding, it was really bad, they started heckling and stuff.  At a wedding?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I kept joking around, like when I was doing the bride cut the cake and stuff. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, I was getting a mic, I just kept going, I hope she don't cut the cheese, too.  No one laughed at that?  Yeah.  I would be howling if a DJ did that at a wedding.  While I was in the band, I grabbed the mic from the DJ, and when the father and her were  dancing, and they were playing daddy's little girl, I kept going, yeah, she ain't so little,  hope you ain't got a big heart on her, something.  Okay, now I can see how they might have started, you know, getting a little mad at you, chip. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, the mother was in a wheelchair, I was making all kinds of jokes about tipping her  over.  I was like, who wants to tip her over and just start fucking her?  They made us pack up our equipment.  Oh, shit.  It's very frightening.  It looks like nine... 
[03:18:00]  Thanks.  This was just...  I just got a tweet.  It looks like Total Pro Sports is a fan of the show.  Oh, really?  They have an article that says nine worst types of people to watch a game with, and they got  a picture of...  Oh, they're all women.  They got a picture of Jimmy and Kenny.  Oh, God.  With Jimmy making his...  Ted Sheckler face.  Ted Sheckler face.  I shouldn't make that face.  I look silly. 
[03:18:30]  You're the example of horrible people to watch games with.  I am not.  I'm fun to watch a game with.  You certainly are.  You certainly...  I get, like, a chance going and stuff among my friends.  Fucking...  Give us one of those, please.  Go.  Go!  Team go!  You know how much other guys hate that?  Go, team go.  When you clap and you're really happy.  That one, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Let's go home so they can start the 10 o'clock hour.  We're doing something new with the 10 o'clock hour.  Yeah, let's do that.  So far, the reviews are really good, but people are mad that we're not replaying the 10 o'clock  hour somewhere.  It's a one-shot deal.  Oh, one-shot deal.  Well, hey, some people get some special things.  Maybe we'll get it on Audible.  I won't see you guys tomorrow, so I'll see you Monday.  I know, Jimmy.  But we'll see you Monday?  Yes.  We're seeing less and less of you, Jimmy.  What's going on?  Where are you going?  Are you becoming a big star out there?  No, it's a temporary thing where a lot of the gigs I booked, the airlines are so hard. 
[03:19:30]  I didn't want to answer.  I know.  Oh, no.  But it's hard to get certain flights.  You know on that star chart, what star are you?  We saw some pretty big stars just now.  On that star chart?  Yeah.  Art Carney.  Audrey Meadow.  I'm trying to think.  It started with the moon.  Yeah.  I think I'm...  Jupiter?  No.  Planet Jupiter.  No.  Are you as big as Jupiter?  No. 
[03:20:00]  As far as stars go?  No.  You're bigger than the moon.  I'm not.  I'm a brick in Camden.  Are you?  Yeah.  Are you a little dust on the moon?  But it slows down soon.  I'm doing a Tonight Show shoot in a couple weeks.  I got a whole bunch of shit away.  Yeah, but it's all...  But then I'm back for good.  It's all good and it helps our show because all these famous people out there mention Opie  and Anthony, which is so nice.  That's your new plug.  Yeah, I always get plugs on terrestrial radio.  And you get the SiriusXM plugs, so they should just leave. 
[03:20:30]  No, they haven't...  Fuck alone!  Honestly, they've been fine.  They haven't...  Honestly, they've not blown my balls.  No, no, they've been cool.  They've been very cool.  They understand.  We're honest people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you fuck up, we're going to tell you, but we'll also tell you when you're doing good.  They've been...  Unfortunately, you don't do enough good stuff for us to say you're doing good.  Oh.  See how I spun that?  Oh.  That was spun out of control.  Why is Wendy Williams on Dancing with the Stars?  She's despicable!  Oh, can we watch that?  Oh, no.  We've got to get out of here today.  Yeah.  I want to watch the Cassie Lee Gifford thing.  It's my new obsession.  What is it? 
[03:21:00]  You weren't here.  Her segment.  It could be the worst fucking thing on TV.  I was here one day and we trashed her.  It's a Huda...  What's her name again?  Huda?  Hoda?  Hoda.  Hoda and Kathy Lee.  Hoda.  It's the worst fucking thing to watch on TV, and there's some bad TV out there.  Hoda.  Oh, I've got to talk to Sam on the way out, don't I, Sam?  About?  Yes.  I don't know, but they always grab us when we're leaving.  Oh, I know, right.  It's never after we piss it on our way back up the hallway.  It's always when we're leaving.  Yeah, to pump up the 10 o'clock hour.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Try to get me on my way out the door, Sam.  I, uh...  What are you doing? 
[03:21:30]  I pumped a little up.  I pumped, too?  I did a little pumping.  I pumped.  What are they going to hear in the 10 o'clock hour today?  And what's the show called?  It's called After Opie and Anthony Live.  Meaning we're still live.  What fucking words are you going to have in it?  Well, I think that's...  I know, it really whips off the tongue.  We're still trying to find a name that makes sense, but it's the  working title.  How about, uh...  All right, what are you doing in the 10 o'clock hour?  Good stuff hosted by a shithead.  That can be good.  Self-deprecating.  Yeah.  Well, if not really, it's you deprecating. 
[03:22:00]  Ah!  We will have...  We'll be featuring some material from Jim Norton off his brand-new CD.  Oh, my God.  That's a get.  And today's the anniversary of something, so we'll be doing this day in O&A history.  I don't want to spoil it yet.  Ow.  Did you talk?  Anniversary of...  No, I spoke.  You just talked?  I did.  I'm putting my coat on.  And, uh...  This is terrible.  Roland has a new obsession.  Yeah.  Food? 
[03:22:30]  Hopefully it's quitting.  Hopefully it's quitting.  It is food-related, but we'll get into all that on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, yeah.  What a tease.  That's a great tease.  So, what are you doing at 10 o'clock?  I just said it.  I wasn't listening.  Well, then you'd have to listen to the replay of this.  Could you start over?  Well, no, because I don't...  Just start over, please.  I wasn't listening, and we've got to sell it properly.  Yeah.  Well, we'll be doing some material for...  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show, damn it. 
[03:23:00]  Or the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
