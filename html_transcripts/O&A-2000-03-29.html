<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts introducing themselves and their phone number.  The show kicked off with a discussion about the Mets' season opener, where Spaz recounted his experience watching the game at 5:05 a.m. in Japan and posited a theory linking losing the first game to missing the World Series.  This segued into Ben promoting a new Black Crows album featuring Jimmy Page, noting its limited availability and unique purchase method, followed by a song from the album being played.  The hosts then hyped their "Whip Em Out Wednesday" event, soliciting self-addressed, stamped envelopes for bumper stickers.

The conversation then veered into a discussion of Britney Spears' recent head injury, devolving into crude and sexually suggestive comparisons between Spears, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore, and Jessica Simpson, filled with offensive comments about their perceived virginity and physical attributes.  Opie and Anthony then delved into a lengthy negotiation over Opie's $600 debt to Anthony, proposing a plan where Anthony invests the money in the stock market. A caller discussed Kathleen Turner's nude scene in a London production of *The Graduate*, prompting further commentary from the hosts.  A WWF/WWE promotional message from Vince McMahon was aired, followed by the hosts discussing current storylines.  Andrew Dice Clay's voice was also briefly heard during this segment.

The show continued with a discussion of top 10 sports films and a listener contest offering Mets tickets. This transitioned into a rambling anecdote about a disastrous trip to an NHL All-Star game, where the hosts got extremely drunk with the Hanson Brothers, scalped their tickets, and ended up at a topless bar.  The story detailed excessive alcohol consumption, public vomiting, and subsequent trouble with their employer.  Comedian Jay Moore called in, and the conversation shifted to the show's "most offensive song contest," with several deeply disturbing song entries played, including songs about child sexual abuse and the Ku Klux Klan.  Moore discussed his upcoming shows and shared an anecdote about a listener recognizing him.  The segment ended with further discussion of the contest, the hosts' upcoming trip to Los Angeles, and more listener calls.

Next, the hosts recounted stealing panties from Veruca Salt after a concert, leading to a discussion of the band's internal conflicts and breakup.  They then played a listener-created song about the "King Gimp" from the Oscars. A heated phone call with Billy ("Fat Guy") from airsick.net ensued, expressing intense dislike for Jay Moore, citing perceived slights and unprofessional behavior. This sparked a debate among callers about Moore, with some defending him and others agreeing with Billy’s criticisms. Dan and Celeste, with their newborn and toddler, then appeared in studio, creating an awkward contrast when a song about child molestation was mistakenly played.

The final segment centered on the farewell of Dan and Celeste, who were moving to South Florida.  However, the segment was largely dominated by increasingly outrageous and offensive antics from Opie, including playing songs that deeply offended Celeste, leading to heated exchanges.  The conversation became incredibly crude, touching on nudity, pregnancy, and sexually suggestive topics.  Numerous callers phoned in to express their disapproval. Opie repeatedly played inappropriate songs, including one described as a “baby rape” song.  Dan and Celeste's departure involved giving the hosts a Rosie O'Donnell doll for them to "torture."  The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, where callers expressed disgust and outrage at the hosts' actions, interspersed with calls of amused agreement. The hosts acknowledged the disastrous nature of the final portion of the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Hopefully you got them today.  What a couple of ass wipes.  1027.  WNEW.  Yeah!  Hey.  Hey.  It's the ONA Show.  How are ya?  Hey.  Oh, you need that?  There you go.  There we go.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027. 
[00:00:30]  Hey!  If you want to work, if you are working, you want to send us a fax, I should say.  Fax us, 212-957-9639.  We have another fine radio show for you today.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  More Mets tickets to give away to opening day?  Fabulous.  I was talking to Spaz in the back office about the Mets.  Yeah.  Everyone knows the Mets started their season in Japan.  Yeah.  The game started at 5 a.m. 
[00:01:00]  Spaz had to watch the whole thing.  Did he?  Is that why he's all tired and everything?  The only people that watched the Mets game this morning were the people that had to get  up early for work.  Yeah.  So they got up maybe a little earlier to, you know, catch the end of the game.  You pop it on, right, as you're getting ready for work.  I heard the ESPN Sports Zone was packed before work today because everyone went in there  to check out a few innings of the game.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But Spaz, set his alarm.  Get Spaz in here real fast. 
[00:01:30]  I set my alarm.  You're going to laugh at this one.  So, Spaz.  Spaz O.D.  I know.  Well, if we go through stage, you would Spaz.  Spaz.  Okay.  So, what time did the Mets game start this morning?  5.05 a.m.  5.05.  5.05 a.m.  Yes.  You set your clock for what time?  Five on the button, so I have five minutes to wake up.  Five minutes to wake up.  And up to TV.  And what was the end of the game?  What was the score?  Final score of the Mets game?  Five to three.  Five to three.  Mets lost, obviously.  Yeah.  And your theory on the Mets loss that you were telling me in the back office? 
[00:02:00]  It's a combination of jet lag.  What?  Jet lag.  Both teams had jet lag.  Yeah, but it's...  I don't know.  It's...  It's a whole thing against the Mets in Major League Baseball.  All right, listen.  No, no, no.  Against the Mets.  It's a conspiracy.  Tell me what you told me in the back office.  In terms of the Japs?  Well, you have this theory about the opening game of a season. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, yes.  My theory...  Man, listen to this.  Okay.  Well, see, last year the Mets lost their first game of the season last year as well.  I believe it gets the Florida Marlins.  Okay.  And they made the playoffs.  So it doesn't matter that they lost the first game because they'll make the playoffs again  because it's back-to-back, you know.  Spaz has this theory, Anthony.  Let me speak for Spaz.  You have to tell me Spaz's theory.  I'm the Spaz translator today.  Spaz has this theory.  If you lose the first game of the Major League season... 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  ...you will not win the World Series.  No, it's because the first game sets the tone for the rest of the season.  There haven't been teams that had a crappy, even first half of the season that just went  on.  Now, if we were Mike and the Mad Dog at the van, we'd be able to get on our computer...  Pull up stats.  ...and we would be able to pull up stats how many teams ended up winning the World Series  even though they lost the first game of the season.  I know...  He is...  I know the Yankees, yeah.  Like eight in a row two years ago.  Right, right. 
[00:03:30]  The Yankees lost, what, eight in a row to start the season?  Right.  Yeah, something ridiculous.  It was like, oh no, it's all over.  Everybody's spelling gloom and doom for the Yankees and...  That's your theory.  That's my theory.  Well, it's a good theory.  You gotta go with it.  The guy's got a melon between his shoulders.  But even though the Mets lost the first game of the season, you're still predicting them  to win the World Series this year, right, Spaz?  I'm predicting them to come very close.  My dream World Series is Mets versus Indians.  That's a dream World Series?  That's a dream World Series. 
[00:04:00]  Why?  Most New Yorkers' dream World Series would be Yankees Mets.  The Subway Series.  The Subway Series.  I don't like the Yankees anymore.  Mm-hmm.  But...  Why the Indians?  Why the Indians?  Because both the Mets and the Indians were underdogs at one point in their careers,  and they both made a surgence.  Oh, a surgence, yeah.  And so two...  Surgeons?  Yeah.  Resurgence.  So what do they do, like open-heart surgery and be surgeons?  No, it's like a surge.  Okay.  Energy.  Yes.  Re...  Resurgence.  And because they're watching the dogs, and now they're not underdogs. 
[00:04:30]  Underdogs said they want to be a good series.  Underdog, but I never liked that cartoon.  Because the sweet polypure, but I was always in trouble.  Spaz, do you realize every team in the league was an underdog at one point in their careers?  Mm-hmm.  Yes, but the Indians were an underdog in the late 80s, early 90s.  Okay, listen.  We'll save all this for Friday.  Someone wants to know if your brain has jet lag.  I'm sitting there in the office getting ready for the show, and he's like, you know, it's 
[00:05:00]  usually a bad sign if the team loses the first game.  It means they're not going to win the World Series.  He completely...  You really believe that?  Yeah.  They'll come close, but...  All right.  Thanks, Spaz.  You can go answer the phone.  Thank you, Spaz.  That was great.  Jesus.  All right, Ant.  We're getting ready for another radio show today?  Yes.  Where's Ben?  I got a copy of the Jimmy Page Black Crows Live at the Greek CD, Anthony.  Yeah.  He's jamming it on the subway on the way into work every day. 
[00:05:30]  And what's the deal with this album, Ben?  You can go to musicmaker.com to purchase it, and you can even design your own, like, compilation.  You can pick the songs in what order, and there's some different tracks on there to pick.  And then they're touring this summer, supposedly coming back around town.  Ant, this is an amazing CD because you cannot buy it in record stores.  Right.  And the reason why you can't buy it in record stores is the reason because Columbia dropped  the Black Crows?  Something to do with that.  Something like that.  Huh.  And they can't put any of their own songs on there. 
[00:06:00]  There's all kinds of red tape.  Wow.  What a clusterf.  But I've been jamming this for the last few days, and I figured, you know, off and on  today, we should feature a few tracks from this damn disc.  Mm-hmm.  I want to start with one that is just making me play air guitar like crazy.  I see.  You look like King Gimp walking around playing air guitar.  Yeah.  That's okay.  You'll recognize the song, though, all right?  It's the Black Crows with Jimmy Page.  Nobody's fault but mine. 
[00:06:30]  We'll go to the phones next.  212-757-1027.  It's WNEW.  Check this out.  All right.  Here it comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie's worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Cruel and Inhuman show.  7-WNEW.  All right.  Yeah.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday, Anthony.  I'll be a little, uh, yeah.  It is.  I forgot about that. 
[00:07:00]  I will give you 10 bucks if you know who's doing this version of the Hoesong.  Hold on.  I hear any vocals?  No.  That's what makes it tough.  I don't know who.  That voice.  Oh, I was going to say that, of course.  I was going to say that.  But I thought I was, you know, look like an ass if I was wrong. 
[00:07:30]  I wasn't sure.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  My music, uh...  It's pretty good.  My music taste is changing.  I'm really into Fat Boy Slim.  I never thought I'd see the day that I'd see him to...  It's like I'm not calling you a fag, okay.  Oh, yeah.  That's me.  It's pretty cool.  You like that?  Yeah.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Well, it's, you know, we're still a little early, Anthony.  Yeah, it's kind of breezy, a little overcast.  It really isn't... 
[00:08:00]  We're holding back.  I mean, we're going to start the whole Whip Em Out Wednesday promotion in the very, very near future.  Boy, but there's no problem with putting the sign on your car now for an early start.  Yeah, you definitely should get an early start.  I guess what I should tell people is we got a brand new WOW logo.  Yeah.  We got about 120,000 WOW bumper stickers that are being printed as we speak.  Uh-huh.  It's going to be all over the tri-state area by the middle of summer.  Trust me on that one, okay?  Huge.  I know a lot of the faithful listeners want one of these new WOW stickers. 
[00:08:30]  So I would suggest you start sending in your self-addressed stamped envelopes.  Yes.  All right.  Immediately.  What address could they send that to, Ben?  Do we have a P.O. box or the 888 7th Avenue?  888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York, 10106.  And just put WOW sticker on there somewhere, okay?  WOW sticker.  WOW sticker, Opie and Anthony, whatever.  888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York, 10106.  And as soon as we get those stickers, we'll mail them back to you, okay? 
[00:09:00]  Right.  But as far as WOW goes, we're still a few weeks away.  Yeah.  But we're all getting excited about that, all right?  Right.  Okay.  And what do you got over there?  You wanted to make a confession today?  What?  Not a confession.  It was tied in with a story we were laughing at in the office about Britney Spears.  Yesterday we were talking about this, but because of a spaz, we didn't get to it.  Yeah.  Yeah, the pop princess Britney Spears suffered head injury after a heavy camera fell on her head during a video shoot. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Which just cracks me up.  All right, all right.  Yeah.  All right, all right.  All right, all right.  All right, all right.  How was I supposed to?  Something wasn't right.  All right.  Yeah.  So what, she was filming her latest video? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, her new video for Oops, I Did It Again.  Yeah.  And she needed four stitches on her head because a camera or something fell on her head.  A heavy camera.  God, that's great.  Boy, is her 15 minutes up yet?  No, not at all.  Nah.  No, there's a ton of people looking just like Britney Spears out there.  Yeah.  I've seen them in that Christina Aguilera hose bag.  No, there's more than that, Anne.  And then there's another one that's like 15. 
[00:10:30]  There's Mandy Smith.  Yeah.  I got it down here.  Oh, do you?  You've been studying all day?  I've been studying the new Britney Spears.  There's like, there's a total of four, I believe.  Four.  You got Aguilera.  Yeah.  She's very slutty.  Yeah.  Who gives it up?  She wants to be Britney very bad, but she's like the second rate Britney.  Remember the battle between Debbie Gibson and Tiffany?  Yeah.  And Debbie Gibson almost had a legitimate recording career going.  And Tiffany was just like completely out of the picture.  She was a mall whore.  She wanted to be. 
[00:11:00]  Well, that's the level she's on.  Yeah.  Just like the whore.  But she won the Grammy over Britney.  So now they're starting to say.  They almost pulled it out of a hat.  They're starting to say Aguilera's a little higher than Britney Spears now, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  But in my opinion, like Christina Aguilera is like the slutty version of Britney.  Right.  Although Britney, I don't know, she's pretty slutty in her videos.  Oh, you don't want to think that way, though, Anthony.  No?  Why?  No, you want to think that she's like the sweet, innocent girl at school, and then you  take her to the prom, you get her in the backseat, and then you slam it home. 
[00:11:30]  Well, uh...  But, all right, so there's Christina Aguilera.  Okay.  The slutty Britney Spears.  Right.  Then there's Mandy Smith, right?  Mandy Smith.  Mandy Smith, I believe.  And Jennifer Simpson.  No, Jessica.  Jessica Simpson.  Oh, Jessica Simpson.  Okay.  And some weird one, Haku or something like that?  Haku.  Haku.  I'm serious.  Wait.  Kunu Wagyu or something.  What do you got in your bag that has this written down, dude? 
[00:12:00]  I am really scared.  No, it was in the latest issue of Entertainment Weekly.  Oh, okay.  All right.  It had the whole rundown.  Yeah, I was studying it.  I was studying it on the train today.  Damn it.  Well, that's, um...  That's great.  But the problem is that Britney Spears is the only one with the breast implants.  All the other ones?  Hey, those aren't implants.  Those are natural.  Ah, come on.  She says that they were smaller in other shots because she was going through puberty.  All right.  Let's go to the phones here. 
[00:12:30]  Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  How are you?  You guys suck, man.  Hey, thanks.  Hey, I just wanted to say, man, you guys ragging on all four or five of these breasts.  Well, yeah, they would deserve a sound pounding from any guy.  Any guy that sees them.  Anthony, I'm very close to stalking Britney Spears.  Are you?  Oh, my God.  You know what, though?  Send me an email.  I'm taking a look.  All right.  I don't know.  There's a couple of real good shots of her and a couple of ones that kind of...  I don't know.  I would definitely do Britney Spears. 
[00:13:00]  A little wacky.  Aguilera doesn't do anything for me.  Every one of them, man.  Every single one of them?  Well, you'd throw them one.  Plants or not.  Let me see that picture on the back of that.  Well, we're guys.  15-year-old, you take to Vegas.  Well, we're guys.  We've got to, like, bang them all.  But, I mean, the one I would enjoy the most would be Britney Spears.  Yeah, I hear you.  She's like the prom date that got away.  She is definitely going to be in penthouse at some point in her life.  Yeah.  Smoking, man.  Like when the whole recording career goes down the tubes next year. 
[00:13:30]  Anthony, nothing but sticky pages, bro.  I bet.  All right, Anthony.  Thank you.  You guys suck, man.  Later.  All right, bye.  Well, Opa, I got to admit, I was going through the magazine rack over at CBS.  And there was a magazine just called Britney.  It was put out by, I don't know, 16 or Team Beat or something like that.  It just said Britney? 
[00:14:00]  It was just Britney with a big picture of Britney Spears.  Oh, baby, baby, how was I?  You were thumbing through the Britney Spears magazine.  Sorry, I'm distracted.  I'm trying to write you a note.  The big Britney magazine.  And looking at all the pictures, there are like 600 pictures of Britney magazine. 
[00:14:30]  And now you're out of sight.  I saw a lot of pictures of her.  And like I said, some of them look really good.  Some of them look really bad.  And she's, a lot of pictures, she had that big, wide, open mouth thing.  And what's the first thing you think when you see her with a big, wide, open mouth?  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe I could feed her a Twinkie?  Virgin. 
[00:15:00]  Virgin.  Virgin.  Is that what you think?  Hey!  Virgin.  Hey!  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Hey!  Virgin.  Oh, yeah.  So I was, you know, I was thumbing through that a little bit.  A little embarrassing.  I went there for my computer magazine, so.  Now, were people walking by going, why the hell is this guy looking at the Britney magazine? 
[00:15:30]  Well, you got to kind of, you got to kind of hide it.  You don't want to be caught doing that, you know?  Especially if you look like you're ready to toss a bat.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Hey!  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Virgin.  You've got to keep going, I'm dying  I'm dying over here  I'm dying over here  I don't think I can finish the show  Virgin  Virgin  Hey  Virgin  Hey

I don't know  Yeah  Because it's hard  To be a Texas  Baptist virgin  Virgin  Right, Scottsdale  And sing those songs  Like Britney sings  And you're just like  Okay, she's singing  About effing  Same thing with that  Aguilera  I don't know  I don't know what  The other's saying  I don't either

[00:27:30]  But I think  I think we're accomplishing  Something when we accomplish  Nothing  I know one thing  It's our job  You're getting as good  As Fat Boy Slim  As far as that mixing goes  Ah  Wow  Come on  That's Scottsdale  You can't go wrong  With the  Virgin  Right  It's Ant Boy Slim  Over there  Making his own mixes  I like it  Hey  All right  Yeah  Well  That was a wonderful break  Is that  Oh, come on

I'm running for Steve's website  Oh, cool  To Alex  Hey, Alex  Do a good job for us 
[00:28:30]  I'll see you guys later  All right, man  Bye  Deal  You can retire when you grow a pube  Who the hell was that?  I don't know  Hey, I'm writing for the website  Just so I can see the naked pictures  Before I'm 18  Let's go to Joe  Joe, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up, fellas?  How are you?  Listen, I was just wondering  Anthony, you were flipping through that magazine  Were you looking for upcoming concert day  So you can get tickets?  Yeah, that's what I was doing  I'm looking for Britney Spears tics  Mandy Moore tics  Whatever I could get  Smartass  Take it easy  All right, bye 
[00:29:00]  Imagine the women that  Hang out at a Britney Spears show, though  Oh, huh?  All dressed like Britney  Remember the old days?  Like Madonna and stuff?  All the girls would dress like  Like a virgin thing?  Like a what, Scotcho?  Virgin  Yes  They'd dress like that  And you'd be like  Huh, girl can't be any more than 12  And she's showing her ass  Yeah, but worse than that  Is the fat girls  That get into like the Madonna outfits  Oh, yeah  That's classic  They always show that footage  On MTV or something  When they're doing  Yeah  Madonna special or whatever 
[00:29:30]  And they have all the girls online  At a concert waiting to get into  The Madonna show  Yeah  And they all dress like  She used to dress in the early 80s  Like a virgin  And there was always that one fat girl  That didn't quite pull off the outfit  Trying to squeak into that little outfit  I think she just ate  Some of the skinnier kids  In front of her  To get a little closer online  You think it's the same way  With the Britney Spears shows?  Yeah, I'm sure  All the girls were wearing  Little belly shirts  And you got the big fat girl  With the belly shirt on  Yeah  Yeah 
[00:30:00]  Showing some of that big belly  Probably  I don't know  I've never been to a Britney Spears concert  Let me again say  Never been to a Britney Spears concert  I say  I'll tell you how the No Doubt show is though  I say we go just as a goof  You want to go to a Britney Spears show?  When's she coming around?  You and I  Jones Beach  Jones Beach?  Yeah  Let's go  Where's she go?  Can we get tickets to that?  It's probably harder to get there  No doubt  We can bang the moms  Oh God  The moms are probably younger than us  And we're not even that old but 
[00:30:30]  I don't know  Britney  Yeah, let's do that  Let's try to get tickets to the Britney Spears show  We'll take a bunch of listeners  Would that be a horror show?  A bunch of our listeners  At the Britney Spears show us your  Skin to win you bitch  And I think it's a brilliant idea  Yeah  We'll get like 20 listeners  Yep  You and I will go  We'll chaperone everyone  We'll get drunk  Oh yeah  We're the chaperones  We'll get drunk and high  And go to the Britney Spears show  A bunch of 30 year old guys  Horrifying the 15 year old girls 
[00:31:00]  That are there for Britney  I like it  I like that too man  Set that up  Alright  Well everyone's calling about the chick singers  Yeah  I think we need to move on  I think we're done with them  And maybe try to start a real radio show now  So if you're calling about that  Please hang up  If you have anything else though  Give us a call  212-757-1027  How you doing  This is Andrew Dice Clay  I got a lot of personality  I mean you've got to get a piece 
[00:31:30]  You've got personnel  Try that one Anthony  You're listening to Anthony and Opie  On WNEW 102.7 Farmer  The Opie and Anthony show  Grown men jumping all over each other  Okay terrific  Alright let's try to accomplish something today  You sent your girlfriend over to our accountant  To have the taxes done 
[00:32:00]  Yeah  Are you insane?  Why?  Do you know Ben?  Ben?  He is perhaps the horniest horn dog on the face of the earth  I wouldn't leave a girl alone with him for more than two seconds  You want to get him back on the line?  I'm sure he's listening to us  No I don't want to go phone too bad  He's got to do my taxes tonight  Tax season upon us  He's got to be nice and stuff  You know  But oh my god  You let Sandy sit in an office alone with him?  Yeah why not  Oh no  See if he has any luck 
[00:32:30]  God damn  I always wait until the last minute  So  This is early for me  Usually like April 14th  I'm running around trying to find a tax guy  I remember the good old days  Grab the easy form  Fill it out  Mail it in  I get my little refund  Have fun  And it is a little refund  I found out  Well now it's like  You've got to fill out 8 billion things  Thank god I lost money on the market last year 
[00:33:00]  That'll help you out  And if today's any indication  I won't have to pay next year either  Jesus am I taking a beating  Man there's a few things I should have dumped out of today  I know it  Yeah  I know it  I should have went with my instinct  Yeah  Got to go with your instincts with this damn market  You certainly do  Instincts and maybe something that's written in the paper  Yeah that too  That too  Oops  Very surprised my guy didn't call me today  As I watch one of my stocks plummet  Oops 
[00:33:30]  They'll be back  NASDAQ's down like 120 points today  Everybody's selling off on the techs  I don't know why  NASDAQ is just whacked out  It's taking a beating  Yeah but it goes  Yeah  Then it goes back up to 5,000  And then it drops another few hundred points  I don't know  This is a great buy  Great buying opportunity right now  If you play it the Anthony way  Unfortunately I bought this time before it went down  So I'm just waiting for it to come back  What a great radio show we have 
[00:34:00]  Talking about fouling underage girls  And now we're talking about stocks  Yeah  This is great  The American dream isn't it  Alright let's go to the folks  Make a little money on the market  Bang a rock chick  Let's see what Joel wants to say today  Joel what's up  I want to talk about Kathleen Turner  And her playing Mrs. Robinson over in England  In the graduate play  It's going to make you puke  She looks like a fat sow  Well there's a problem with that  I guess she's getting naked during the play too 
[00:34:30]  Yeah  Yeah that's what I heard  Yeah Kathleen Turner  She's doing the graduate on stage over there in London  Here's another example of things we talk about  And she's taking off her clothes  Now Kathleen  You had to wait until you're  She says 45  She does say she's 45  Yeah  Give her a take 10  Then they have a picture of her from Body Heat 
[00:35:00]  The movie Body Heat  Yeah  Which I believe was 1981  1981  Which let's do a little math  Would make her  28  Very doable  No not even  Well  She's not 45 first of all  She's got to be pushing 50  1981 was 19 years ago  She's like  Let's say 31  30-31 back in 81  Yeah  Doable  Why didn't she take it off then 
[00:35:30]  Exactly  That's what I'm saying  You know  Take it off live on stage then  These women all wait until  They're in their 50s  Before they decide to take their clothes off  Another good example of that was Farrah Fawcett  That's another one  Everyone  Who didn't want to see Farrah naked in Playboy  In the 70s during the Charlie's Angels years  Instead we got the Farrah Fawcett picture  With the red bathing suit  With the nips popping out  Yeah  Remember that  Why didn't she go all new then  Uh uh  She uh  She waited  Until  Time ravaged 
[00:36:00]  Time did its  Evilness on her  I mean  And obviously yes  She still looks pretty good for her age  You know  You don't see a lot of women walking around her age  That look that good  But it's not the Farrah Fawcett  That we all wanted to see  When we were young  And this Kathleen Turner  Now naked  Why  Why the hell is she doing that  Okay  Horrific  Yeah  Well  I don't know  Alright 
[00:36:30]  Did you have something on this Joel  Or you just wanted to bring it to our attention  No I just wanted to  Kind of see what you guys  I wanted to  I thought you guys would  Kind of be the same page I'd be  And uh  And you know  Like you guys were saying  You know  Back  Back in the  Body heat  Days  She could have probably pulled it off  Now she  You know  Joel  She used to be so  Freaking hot  I know  I know  And just like Anthony said  You know  Why didn't she take it off  Back in 81  During body heat  Simple as that  You know 
[00:37:00]  Kathleen Turner  She's one of those affected people  One of those voices  I'm on the stage  In the London theater  In the stage version of the movie Graduate  And I  Am nude  In this production  I've got a man voice now  Thank you Joel  Thanks guys  Later  With those thunder thighs of hers  I don't think she could do the famous scene that Anne Bancroft did  With the leg  With the leg up  And the camera  You know  Zooming in on Dustin Hoffman's face 
[00:37:30]  This is Robinson  I think you're trying to  Excuse me  That one  Right  Just see this big  Cellulite thigh  Flapping  I don't believe they'd be able to do that  No  Anthony Robert from Long Island  Writes on the instant feedback  Hey Opie  Weren't you supposed to write Anthony a check about an hour ago  Hey yeah  Hey  Right you were  Hey  Hey  And I'm embarrassed to say that I forgot my checkbook 
[00:38:00]  You forgot your checkbook  Well the market  Who struggles  Right  Hope he find his checkbook  I'm very embarrassed but I mean the market's not doing well today  But that's when I would have put the money in  Like now  Yeah  You put it in when the market's down  What am I going to do  Buy when it's up  On the highs  If you weren't listening yesterday  I'm finally going to pay Anthony his money  I was supposed to do it today  But Anthony being a pal of mine  Came up with a great idea 
[00:38:30]  He's going to take my 600 bucks that I owe him  From the cruise that my girlfriend took with  With someone Anthony used to know  How do we refer to her?  Yeah because it's not finalized yet  Let's just say  Someone you used to know  The complainant  So Anthony is going to take the 600 bucks I owe  And he's going to attempt to double the money  I will  Double it in the market  And then pay you the money that you paid me 
[00:39:00]  That way I get my money  And you're not totally out the money  Because you really didn't know what was going on  You didn't know that your girlfriend was getting a vacation paid for  On my American Express card  Right  I really didn't know at the time  From the complainant  Right okay  Right  So now  But today would have been a good time  Now I'm willing  If you do say that you are going to give me this money  I have to  I am willing to  Our friendship depends on it  Front  You know  You do like a fronting thing  Yeah  So I will now buy 
[00:39:30]  You're going to buy now?  Something  And then  I will  Are you going to buy right this minute?  Yes I think so  Okay  I promise you  The 600 dollars comes tomorrow then  Now there's a couple of issues here I think  Okay  What if the 600 dollars I give you  Yeah  You completely lose  I'm off the hook?  That's my problem  Okay  That's not your problem  The other thing  Because I know some days  Some days you do really well  What if you like quadruple my 600 bucks?  Then you will be very happy with the money that you owed me 
[00:40:00]  Damn it  That's it  What do you think?  Would you throw me just a little extra?  No  Not at all  Are you buying right now?  I am ready to buy  Absolutely  Alright you're going to push send  Here we go  I'm punching up what I'm getting  Alright push okay  Please hold  I will give you the money tomorrow  Okay  There it is  And  Let's look down the list 
[00:40:30]  Oh yeah  That's what I need  Can you tell people what you're buying?  It's probably not ethical too  But I'll tell you one thing  Yeah  It ain't yippy  I know that much  It ain't yippy  It ain't yippy  Okay  Alright  Let's see what it's  Okay  Let me go down the list  180  80  Okay  Alright 
[00:41:00]  I can do that  I'll pop in  I'll pop in right  There  Okay  Are you setting a buy price  Or are you just going in?  I'm in  You're in  I'm in  My $600 that I owe you  Is invested officially  It is duly invested  And not in yippy  Alright  Is there a possibility  That you will sell this  Before the end of the show today?  Ooh  Looking at the NAS today?  No  Probably not  It would take a miracle  In the next 20 minutes  Alright  But  Oh that's right 
[00:41:30]  It closes in 20 minutes  Yeah  Another hour or so  Tomorrow  We should see a very nice bounce  On this issue  I'll be  Okay  I wouldn't worry about it  Now  If you make my  If you make my money back  Before tomorrow  I don't even have to  Write the check  I'm just asking right?  Hey wait a minute  If you really get off  The hook here  Don't ya  So  No  No  You know something?  No  No  No  Wait officially 
[00:42:00]  Right  If you make my $600  Back by showtime tomorrow  Uh huh  I don't have to cut you a check  No you do  Why?  Because I want you to  Write that god damn check  And then I will pay you back  Okay  But if you make the money  I don't care  Then I don't owe you anything  Officially  I don't care  Just consider it margin  No  What if  What if I don't pull it out?  What if I let it ride?  No see  Come on  That's not fair to me  No see  You have to pay me the money 
[00:42:30]  But what if  You make my $600  Back before  I see you tomorrow  Then you give me the check  I don't owe you nothing  At that point  You  Then  God is going to force you  To sell it  At that point  To get me off the hook  And give you a little money  Then you write me the check  No  And I will write you a check  I think we have a problem  It's a symbolic exchange of funds  To keep the records straight  Will you symbolically rip it up in front of me  After I give it to you?  No I will cash it  And you will cash the check I give you 
[00:43:00]  No I don't trust you  Oh come on  See you can trust me  But I don't trust you  Oh my god  You're  You're insane  You're too much man  You're insane  The deal is  I have to give you the $600  That you just invested  Right  On  This stock that's not yippee  Right  Right  Okay  I think we need to go to the phones  So logically  If you make my $600 back  Before I see you tomorrow  Why do I owe you anything?  I understand what you're saying 
[00:43:30]  Yeah  Realistically speaking  You would have never invested that money  If it wasn't for me  Oh man  I probably would have  But realistically speaking  You're right  Okay  But  Symbolically  I want that check  I want you to write a check to me  For the amount of money  That that cruise cost  And how come it's $600 now  Not $600 and change  Like it was  Was it $600 and change?  I don't even know  I've got to pull up my statement 
[00:44:00]  Lewis what's up?  Dude  Dude  Anthony  Yeah  Are you Italian?  Yeah  Because  What kind of  Pussy Italian guy  Can't collect money  From a wuss  Irish  First of all  I'm not Irish  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  White guy  White guy  I mean  Any Italian guy  Worth his weight  In  Provolone  Yeah  Has got to be able  To collect money  From a puss  Like oh 
[00:44:30]  Oh easy  I mean come on  All right  Thank you  Bye  Bye  Jeez  Let's go to Paul  Paul what's up?  Hey what's up  Paul  How are you?  Listen it's just like  If you work  Or deal with a brokerage firm  You could buy a stock  And on the same day  Sell it  It's a quadruple  But you still got to  Send a payment in  Send the check  Send the check  Anthony's right  I'm sorry  I got to take  I love you both  Am I right Anthony?  You got to send  The check in 
[00:45:00]  You are absolutely right  You're killing me  Thank you  You're killing me  Come on  You're trying to get out of this  And it's not fair  You're killing me  I'm washed up  I know my stuff baby  All right Paul  I love you both  You're the great  Send the case  You like yesterday  All right bye  Yup  You're killing me  That's just not fair  Mike what's up?  Yeah  I don't understand  You owe him six and change  Yeah  And now  He's going to  He's send  And you're going to owe him  Another six and change  And he won't get the first check  No no no no 
[00:45:30]  He already  He already put the order in  First of all  Yeah  Right  All he's doing is  Taking the money that I owe him  And he just invested it  To try to make  You know my money back  I'm doing Opie  A little bit of a favor here  Yeah but you don't put it in a hole  And you haven't seen the first six hundred  By letting him off the hook  Yeah technically  It's just  It's twelve hundred down right now  No I'm not  No no  Because that's six hundred dollars  Of your money  You just punched in  Right  But you have to pay me  The money  You have to give me the check  Like I said technically  You're twelve hundred in the hole  He better give me that god damn check 
[00:46:00]  All right Mike  Thank you  No problem  Why is everyone saying  That you're getting screwed  Joe  Yeah  Hey  Dude  Anthony  You're getting screwed  How  What is the thing  You owe him  He owes you a six hundred and change  Right  Yeah  Right  So basically you're investing  As a favor to him  Yes  Would you have invested the money  If you weren't doing a favor for him  Yes you would have  Yeah probably  Yeah  Oh you would have  Okay  Oh come on  This stock is down this much today  I'm in 
[00:46:30]  All right  So he should give you that six hundred dollars then  Because what's happening is  You're putting in your own money  Mm-hmm  And  But Joe  Joe  Joe  Listen to me  And then tell me what I should do  All right  All right  Ant  Mm-hmm  Just invest the money  I owe him  Okay  Right  He's trying to make  But it's his own money  All right  I understand that  But he's trying to make my money back  Right  Right  Okay  If by the time  I see him  This thing doubles  Shouldn't he sell  And then we call it even  And then I don't have to pay him anything 
[00:47:00]  Symbolically  You must write me the check  In good faith  I think he should have  To give you the money regardless  All I'm saying is  Yeah you should  You know why  Because you should have written  The goddamn thing today  I know  Right now  I did screw up  I did forget  Another thing guys  Yeah  I work with the Special Olympics  And  You need to be our shortstop  Yeah  And he left to pursue his singing career  And I was wondering if  Spaz wants to fill his spot  Spaz  We'll have to ask Spaz 
[00:47:30]  He might want to  Thank you Joe  All right thanks  Bye  All I'm saying is like  Logically  Because this is getting boring  Yeah  If I see you tomorrow  And the money's still invested  And you haven't made anything back yet  You're even maybe a little down  A little up  Uh huh  Then obviously  I have to give you the money  At that point  Yeah  But if I see you tomorrow  And you've already sold the stock  And you made my money back  Plus you made some for yourself  I still want your check  Ugh  I want it run through the bank  I want it cashed 
[00:48:00]  I want  I want you to get the returns check  I don't have enough funds there  Come on  Yeah right  Oh it doesn't have 600 bucks  In his account  Yeah give me his wallet  No  There you go  Give me that thing Ben  That's not going to do you any good  I was going to say  I'll like you  Look at that  He never carries cash  Look at that pathetic condom  It's been sitting there for years  Look at it  It's worn a hole right through the back of the wallet  No I want that 
[00:48:30]  Yeah see I want that  All right  As a symbolic gesture  All right  Then that's what I'll do  By the way  The stock that's not yippee  Yeah  Just dropped two points  So how much have you lost  On my money  Don't worry about it  Nothing realized  But so don't you worry about it  Oh my god  All right  We got to take a break  Yeah  Oh wait  Let's talk to Karen real fast  Move on to something else here  Karen what's up  Hey

[00:54:00]  The McMahon's just battling it out  Lately on WWF  Yeah  A lot of fun to watch  You had Stephanie McMahon slapping her mom  She gave it a little stupid slap  It was still good though  Yeah  And then Shane McMahon  Pretty much knocks Vince out  From behind  Yeah  And then they're pummeling him  With the Triple H and everything  Very entertaining though  I don't know  What is Stephanie  Because at some point  Stephanie's going to have to  Turn back again  To being a good girl  And what's she going to do  Go back to being the shy little thing 
[00:54:30]  And she's in the leather pants  And the shirts that show her cans  I mean what's she going to do  It must be tough for like her dad  Vince  I know  To hear like 15,000 people  Just you know  Chanting slut  Slut  Slut  Every time he walks out  I know  Gag or no gag  That's got to kill a father  Just a little bit  Stephanie  Now remember  You're in a character  This is not you  And us as a family  This is a character  That you're portraying 
[00:55:00]  When they yell  Slut  Whore  And what not  I think they're going to  Ride this one  For a long time though  Yeah  We're all four members  Of the family  Are against each other  Yeah  So I mean  They're not going to  They're not going to  Come together  For a long time  I believe  No  Because they got  A great storyline there  Well you know  At Wrestlemania  They usually do something  Kind of wacky  And twisted  The storylines  Usually take a turn  So I don't know  What we're going to see  Well maybe  Out of the four  They'll pair up  Yeah  It'll be the girls  Against the guys  I don't know 
[00:55:30]  Shane's got to be  Against Vince  Yeah  So maybe the  Kids against the  Pairs  Maybe that  Yeah  That's a good one  But I'm hoping to get  Someone from the WWF  On the show  Before the end of the week  To promote Wrestlemania  That'd be cool  Yeah  I know they listened to us  Up there in Connecticut  Rick's on vacation  So if you're trying  To get a hold of us  Just ask for  For my extension  Yeah  And we'll  We'll work something out  Okay  Right  Hey Anthony  All this week  We got tickets  To opening day  At Shea Stadium

[01:02:30]  Alrighty  Sorry about that  Thank you  But if I was  You know making this list  Slapshot would have been  At the top  Best sports film of all time  Yeah coach  Remember we got drunk  With the brothers  With the Hanson brothers  Yeah  They were doing some kind  Of an appearance  Up in Boston  At the all star game  Up there  When we went  And they were all tanked  Well first of all  We never went to the game  Yeah we just hung out  In the bar  We never made it  The bar was in the same building  As that  Well it was in Boston 
[01:03:00]  You know we got to  Stop the contest for a second  I mean keep calling  With your guesses  But we have a good story  To tell right here  We got so loaded  With the Hanson brothers  That we didn't make it  Into the game  No because  The all star game  The last radio station  We worked with  They came up  With a pretty good idea  Yeah  We get a lot of  Wacky ideas thrown at us  This idea was  Go to the NHL  All star game  With Opie and Anthony  In the limo  Right  I like the idea  Sure  Okay 
[01:03:30]  It's nice we get to see  The all star game  Sure  Couple listeners get to see it  Oh yeah  Yeah  There was a few problems  With this plan  Game started at 8  We picked up our listeners  At 2  Yeah  You do the math  Ho ho ho  Ho ho Danny  By 2  By 2.05  Because one of  One of our friends  Who's a bar owner  Went with us as well  Yeah  By 2.05  We are already slamming down  Our first  Long Island iced tea  I believe  Yeah  Or something very similar  To a Long Island iced tea 
[01:04:00]  And one of the listeners  Was chugging tequila  Straight out of the bottle  In the limo  He was wrecked  Before we even got  2 miles down the road  I think  He was drinking so much tequila  That at the stop lights  He was getting out  And puking  Puking  On the double yellow line  Remember that  We stop at one point  And he goes  Where are you going  Right  He's like  One minute  I'll  He just whoops  Gets back in  He's like  Woo  Ready to party again man  And he keeps drinking  See the problem was  We went with  An ex-marine 
[01:04:30]  And I believe  A frat guy  From this college  We were so  Freaking snotty  Yeah  By the time we made it  To the fleet center  Yeah we get to the fleet center  There's a bar right in the  Same building  So you don't even have to  Get this  You didn't even have to  Go outside from the bar  Into the arena  To see the all star game  Just had to go upstairs  Upstairs through a hallway  We're in  We're in the building  We never made it  Out of the bar  We watched the all star game  With the Hanson brothers  On TV  Drinking  It gets better than that though 
[01:05:00]  I'm not sure  What's wrong with you  Drink you fag  Don't quote me on this  But I think  One of these huge  Beer companies  Was the sponsor  Of the NHL all star game  That year in Boston  Oh yeah  Yeah  Okay  Oh I forgot about this  They gave us the tickets  Yeah we had like  Really good tickets  For the NHL all star game  Everyone in Boston  Wanted to go  We had two for  Ant and I  And two for these  Two listeners  We had four  Primo seats  Big promotion 
[01:05:30]  Promoted on the radio station  This beer company  And all right  Yeah  And what did we do  With our tickets  We were drunk in the bar  And then we went outside  And scalped them  We didn't give them  To someone to scalp  Your pals Opie and Anthony  Went on the street  And scalped the tickets  And taped the whole thing  Hey man you need tickets  Who needs tickets  Who needs tickets  It was like  We walked out of the fleet center  And when we announced  We had tickets to the NHL  All star game  It was like throwing chum  In the middle of the ocean 
[01:06:00]  And watching the sharks attack  It was amazing  We almost got killed  We taped the whole damn thing  And we're trying to be cool  So we don't get arrested  Right  So it's like  Okay well  Meet me behind this pole  And give me the money  But don't  No don't give me the money  You give him the money  Like Opie would get the money  For my tickets  And I'd get the money  For his tickets  And then you'd have to go  To Opie to get the tickets  Right  It had a big scheme plan  We made a bloody fortune  And we're all  Give tickets  We were hammered  We taped the whole thing 
[01:06:30]  With a little mini recorder  And then we put it on our radio show  The next day  Yeah we implicated ourselves  Oh we got in so much trouble  Yeah  Because they're like  Oh my god  You know  We go through to get tickets  For you guys  On these things  And if the sponsors think  You're just going to go out  And scalp them  They're never going to give you  Tickets again  Yeah  So then we're in the bar  Because now we don't have tickets  And the game's right upstairs  We're just snotted  Next thing you know  We run into our listeners  Yeah  We're like  Dude  You guys should be upstairs  Watching the game  Oh man  We scalped our tickets  They scalped them 
[01:07:00]  So we hopped in the limo  And went to a  Topless joint  With the money we got  From the tickets  We were so hammered  We got home that night  Drunk off our ass  Smelling like whore  Right  We got in so much trouble  We were supposed to be home by  Honestly I think  We said like  Ah yeah  It's a stupid  You know  Promotion with the listeners  We'll probably leave by  You know  We'll leave after the second period  We'll get home by 
[01:07:30]  You know  10.30  We'll go out for late dinner  Blah blah blah  Yeah  And what time did we show up  It was somewhere between  Four and five  Something like that  Probably closer to five  Oh  Just drunk  The whore perfume  From the booby dancers  All over you  Cause we had  I mean we blew all the money  We made scalped the tickets  On topless dancers  How was the game?  Oh  It was good man  It was good  My girlfriend got me back 
[01:08:00]  So bad  Cause I was so  Hungover  Not only Saturday  Cause I think it was on a Friday night  Not only Saturday  But Sunday as well  And she wouldn't help me out at all  Well  It sucked so bad  The all star game was what  In like February  I think it's the beginning of February  Somewhere around there  Yeah  And I  I still had Christmas lights up  Yeah  At the apartment  I had to take the Christmas lights down  As punishment  Like I'm hungover  I'm ready to woof  It was still  There's still snow on the ground  It's cold  It's Boston 
[01:08:30]  And I'm just like  Oh my god  I'm gonna puke  I don't feel very good  Get up  Take that Christmas  My dad  Tomorrow in the morning  You were at least able to function  I was dry heaving  From my butt  That's how bad it was  Between the food and the booze  No it wasn't even that  It was just  Dry heaving from the butt  There was contractions  There was contractions  But nothing was going on  Really  Oh my god  What a day 
[01:09:00]  What a day for sport  And then we  Then we get back to the station  On Monday  And everyone's like  Hey how was the game  And stuff  And the promotion  We're like  I'm good  We'll be talking about it  On the radio  In about two hours  Yeah  You might want to listen  Remember the one listener  Got out on the way  Back home  At a convenience store  He gets out of the limo  He's like  Pull over  I want to get something  We figured  You know  Cause everyone's  They've just been puking  And stuff  We figure he's getting  A slurpy or an iced tea  Or something  He gets out  Pukes all over the parking lot

[01:49:00]  You whore!  Double whore!  You whore!  You whore!  Open it up and jump on me!  Come on!  I just tried this!  Get out of here!  Ah!  Ah!  Look out!  Okay.  Yeah, Squatting join now. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  Okay.  You never know where this cluster F has gotten at any given moment, do you?  Remember, kids, fart equals funny.  Okay.  Where were we?  Oh, we were at number four.  This has been such a mess of a radio show today, man.  Why not? I'm having fun.  What the hell?  We don't care.  So I guess we're at the top five.  Top five sports films of all time, according to USA.  Well, I said five Bulldorm. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, but that was about 20 minutes ago.  All right, it was Bulldorm in fifth place.  Fourth place, Rocky.  Third place, The Natural.  Yeah, give it to me.  Third place, The Natural.  It's The Natural Movement.  I like it natural.  Adrian always does it natural.  She don't need no cow pique or none of that stuff.  It just comes out.  I think it's her diet.  Yeah, Adrian!  I like it natural. 
[01:50:30]  Okay.  Virgin.  Okay.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, okay, terrific to you, too.  All right, in second place, Field of Dreams.  Yeah.  And first place, top sports film of all time, according to USA.  Hoosiers.  Hoosiers.  Hoosiers.  Yeah, believe it or not, we're in our 30s. 
[01:51:00]  You got that right.  You have that to look forward to.  All the guys I went to high school with, they got real jobs.  They have to wear suits every day, and we make fart jokes every day.  John, what's going on?  Oh, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just basically crapped myself in the car with Don Rocky episodes.  Unbelievable.  I've never, oh, I just, you guys are stooped to an all-time high.  Hi.  An all-time high. 
[01:51:30]  That was just great.  Okay.  All right.  Just keep up the good work.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  I guess.  Very good.  John enjoyed that, so.  Oh, do I need a drink?  Yeah, let's take a break, Anthony.  All righty.  We have no clue what we're doing next, but if you want to stick around, by all means do  so, okay?  Opie and Anthony.  How often do you get to listen to somebody's cell phone to somebody's uterus?  More stupidity on the way. 
[01:52:00]  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, I can finally breathe again.  That was damn funny, man.  Hey, do we have the Filter tickets to give away?  Yeah.  Filter, one of the many great shows coming to town.  Anthony.  Yes.  I know that.  I'm looking at the concert list here.  Yeah, let me look. 
[01:52:30]  And let's see who I want to see.  All right.  Corn this weekend at the Continental Arena.  I'd be there if you weren't in L.A.  Right.  Let's see who else I'd go see.  Well, Ann would go see No Doubt.  Do we have Anthony's No Doubt tickets yet?  We're good.  Oh, good.  Cool.  We want a full report, Anthony.  Oh, I'll give you one.  Filter played April 20th at the Hammerstein Ballroom. 
[01:53:00]  We have tickets to give away all this week on our show.  Filter's a great band, so if you're not into Filter, please don't call to try to win these  tickets because...  Yeah, don't be a prized whore.  I hate the people.  There are so many people that win stuff on our show and never pick it up because they just  want to win to win.  That's bogus.  I thought Veruca Salt broke up.  Well, Veruca Salt is warming up for Filter, Anthony.  Yeah.  What's up with that?  We've got to get them back in here.  Yeah, like they'll even talk to us anymore. 
[01:53:30]  We stole their panties.  We were such a mess.  Yeah.  We stole Veruca Salt's panties and they were so freaking pissed at us.  They were really pissed.  How did that story go again, Ann?  I bet you on the air, because we were going to go to Veruca Salt and Bush up in Boston.  Yeah.  And I made you a bet on the air that I would steal one of their panties.  Nina or Luis?  Nina.  Nina?  Yeah.  Yeah, Nina's panties.  Yeah, I would grab Nina's panties.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  And, you know, we're hanging with them because we were kind of friends with them and stuff.  They were on our show a bunch at our last radio job.  We would get drunk with them and, like, really get very close to screwing them.  What?  Come on.  It was kind of funny.  Stay on the screw thing.  Come on.  You know what I mean.  I told Sam we were just friends.  I said very close.  Don't worry about it.  And it was very close.  The blonde one liked me.  So I was going to steal the panties.  Swear. 
[01:54:30]  I was going to steal the panties.  I could have had some rock star.  Veruca Gay.  Veruca.  We would get drunk with them and stuff.  Check this out.  We got so close with Veruca Salt before we pulled this little stunt that Ant's about to tell.  They used to, like, dedicate songs to us.  It would be a sold-out show at the Fleet Center up there.  It would be, like, what, 18,000, 19,000 people there because they were warming up for Bush? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  And they would send out songs to Ant and I.  It would rock.  It was really getting close.  And our girls would look at us like, what's that all about?  Ah, nothing.  Ah, now you mention why it didn't happen.  Anyway.  Yeah, so you made this bet on it.  Yeah, I said, I'll get a panty.  Because we were flirting back and forth a little bit.  So I'm like, Ant, okay.  All right, let's see how good you are.  I want you to bring Nina, I think it was Nina's, Nina's panties back to our show. 
[01:55:30]  I'm like, sure, no problem.  Right.  So I'm hanging out backstage and stuff.  And I said, can I keep these panties?  You know, just grabbing at them.  And she said, yeah.  No, I know what it was.  But you got to give them back.  Yeah.  I want them back at some point.  I don't know what it was because we were pushing it so much on our radio show.  And everyone knew we were going to the show and we were going to be on stage.  Yeah.  So you go, look, man, everyone is counting on me to bring your panties out on stage.  I need the panties.  And you're like, come on, I just need them for like five seconds. 
[01:56:00]  I show the crowd, they'll go crazy.  And then I'll give them back to you, right?  Yeah.  So Ant gets her panties, she takes them off.  Yeah.  Shows the crowd.  The crowd goes ballistic because all our listeners were there.  And then you proceeded to keep them.  Because I was going to give them away.  We were going to do like a giveaway, win Veruca's old panties.  I thought we were going to make tea out of them.  So I get a phone call.  Get home that night.  It's like three in the morning.  It's the guy that used to do the TV show. 
[01:56:30]  The Real Rock TV.  That we were part of, yeah.  You have to give back those panties.  Like what?  Ian, what's the problem?  You got to give them back.  She is so pissed off that you just hit those panties.  Like, oh.  He goes, you got to drive back here and get them.  I'm like, look.  I'm like 20 miles out of Boston.  I'm not driving back.  Okay.  I'll drive and pick them up.  All right.  They'll be hanging on the doorknob.  So that's where they were in the apartment. 
[01:57:00]  They were hanging on the doorknob.  And that was the last time we talked to Veruca Salt.  They were pissed.  We really, they were extremely pissed.  And we really need to get them on the phone to see if they're still pissed at you and I, Anthony.  It's been a couple of years now.  It's okay.  Nothing a little modest that 7 doesn't clear up.  You don't have to be embarrassed about it.  So, can we try to make that happen?  We'll get Veruca Salt in.  They'll play some songs.  We'll see if they're pissed at us still.  I think they're pissed at each other.  Weren't they all like, didn't they break up?  Supposedly they broke up because one of them was going out with the other one's boyfriend or something behind their back. 
[01:57:30]  That's the rumor I heard.  One of them was banging Dave Grohl for a while.  Right.  And then, yeah, there was something that went on with each of their respective dudes.  Yeah.  I don't know.  So I guess they figured they weren't selling any albums alone, so they hooked back up again.  So they're warming up for Filter, to make a long story short.  And with that, we have a pair of tickets to see Filter.  I'm telling you, Filter's great.  We'll give them to the 10th caller right now at 212.  To 757-1027, okay? 
[01:58:00]  Okay.  Anthony, we need to take a quick musical break.  Yeah.  I promised today that we would be featuring tracks from the Jimmy Page Black Crow CD.  Yeah.  There's a problem, though.  What?  I've been jamming this damn disc for the last three days on the subway.  Yeah.  What do you got over there?  What?  Go ahead.  This one doesn't work.  Oh, it doesn't work?  No.  The key not assigned. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, I wanted that one.  I don't care.  You had something good?  Anyway, Ant.  Yeah.  We were going to feature tracks from the Jimmy Page Black Crow CD.  Mm-hmm.  Because I've been jamming it.  I think it's cool.  Wanted to turn some people on to it.  You can't even get this disc in the record stores.  You've got to go to where, Ben?  It's musicmaker.com.  Musicmaker.com.  I'm amazed that this thing is not available in record stores because it completely rocks.  Jimmy Page and the Black Crows getting together to do a lot of Led Zeppelin classics. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  So I wanted to feature some of the tracks, right?  Good idea.  I told Jay Moore about the disc on the air about, what, 40 minutes ago, Ant?  Yeah.  Jay was so excited.  He said, send me a copy.  Mm-hmm.  So I go, Ben, no problem.  Send Jay Moore a copy of the Jimmy Page Black Crow CD.  How fast did that thing leave the studio?  Not only did he send Jay Moore a copy, he sent my copy that I've been jamming for the last three days.  Now I have nothing to listen to on the subway tonight.  We don't have another copy laying around?  Don't have any more copies. 
[01:59:30]  And I promised everyone we would, you know, feature tracks off this damn thing today.  So we do have the single.  But, like, all the other stations are playing the single.  I want to, like, play, like, In My Time of Dying or something.  All right.  Well, Jay Moore's got my disc, and we'll play the single.  We'll let a few stations are jamming.  What is and what should never be.  What up, yay.  Quick musical break.  We're going to regroup, and we'll be back.  But check this out.  We really like this right now.  It's WNEW.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:00:00]  1027 WNEW.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  All our affiliates back from their commercial breaks.  All our affiliates.  You joke.  It certainly is.  That's why you always hear that delay in music.  Yeah.  Got to wait for all the affiliates to come back from their local commercial breaks.  And we'd like to welcome to the network WXYZ.  Right. 
[02:00:30]  Living Georgia.  We're just getting ready for syndication, so.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Wow.  Yeah.  We don't really carry the way one of these days.  All right.  Well, we're here.  It's a radio show.  And it's a complete clusterf today, but we're having fun.  Our phone line is 212-757-1027.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  Hey, a lot of people are telling us that King Gimp is going to be on HBO next month. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah?  The dude from the Oscars that was flailing all over the floor.  The movie itself?  Yeah.  Is going to be shown on HBO.  HBO next month.  I'd like to see that.  I hear there's an unbelievable scene where he makes popcorn.  What?  Yeah.  What is he just like?  I mean, hold the Jiffy Pop handle and let him go, tell him he won the Oscar.  That's all he'd need to do.  I think it was the Post had a big, huge article on King Gimp. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  The Gimp there.  And there's a scene that's going to be on HBO where he makes popcorn.  It takes him, like, forever.  And then I was laughing again on the train.  This guy is hilarious.  I don't know if he's...  Oh, yeah, a load of laughs.  I don't know if he's trying to be hilarious, but he's funny.  So he makes the popcorn.  It takes him, like, a really, really long time.  And then half of it falls on the floor.  So he falls on the floor and starts eating the popcorn right off the floor.  Off the floor.  It's part of this documentary, yes.  Holy smoke.  I've got to say this. 
[02:02:00]  King Gimp.  King Gimp.  Looking forward to it.  King Gimpster.  How many times have you seen the King Gimp clip from the Oscars, Anthony?  Probably as many times as I've seen the Hindenburg explode and Kennedy get shot in the head.  I keep rewinding the tape.  And just watching him fall on the floor from the Oscars.  It's great.  The one guy is trying to hold him.  And he slides and falls on the floor and starts convulsing.  Well, we have a new song about the Gimp.  Oh, really?  About King Gimp.  And who do we have to thank for this? 
[02:02:30]  Well, we've got to thank Billy and Paul from airsick.net.  Ah.  The guys that hate Jay more.  From the people that hate Jay more.  From the people that hate Jay more, they've got a great King Gimp song, Anthony.  Let me tell you something.  But when Jay is here next week, I have a prediction to make.  Can I make a little prediction?  Yeah.  This is going to get so effing ugly that you're not going to believe it.  See, the interesting thing, Billy.  Yeah.  He doesn't beat around the bush ever. 
[02:03:00]  Right.  Paul.  We had Paul on the air a little while ago.  And it's kind of obvious that both the guys do not like Jay more.  They have some problem with Jay.  Yeah.  Which is fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't care.  Because the last time we had Billy and Paul in here from airsick, and we had Jay just having  a call in from L.A.  And I don't know if the guys were all pissed because, you know, Jay was taking some time  away from them or what, but there was some major tension.  Yeah.  Jay's making us laugh like crazy because, flat out, we think he's really funny. 
[02:03:30]  Uh-huh.  And Billy and Paul were sitting right over there with their arms folded.  Yeah.  Not even moving.  Not smiling.  Actually, uh, grimacing, basically, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Frowning.  Sort of annoyed.  Annoyed.  But like you said, um, Paul might beat around the bush a little, but Billy, oh my God.  Billy tells it how it is.  He just goes all out.  So we had Paul on the phone, and we brought it up with him, and Paul kind of wouldn't  really tell us what the problem was. 
[02:04:00]  Remember when, uh, Billy was in here with the, uh, black guys when we were having the  racial get-together?  Oh, that was great, yes.  And, uh, one of the black guys called him, uh, called him fat guy.  And he just turned around and laid into this guy.  We were roaring, laughing.  I was proud of Billy that day.  Billy does not pull punches.  So if, if, I don't know.  I don't know.  I just predict something might unwind.  We just, we just know that, we just know there's a story there, and if it, if it's worth  telling on the radio.  Yeah, we're not getting the full, uh, gist of what's going on between these, uh, parts. 
[02:04:30]  So I know Billy listens a lot if he wants to call in.  The outspoken Billy.  The outspoken Billy.  We'll see if he calls in.  Yeah.  He doesn't have to, Billy.  You don't have to.  But we just felt, we just saw the tension and want to get to the bottom of it.  That's all.  Uh, but with that said, uh, the, the guys from Air Sick came up with a really funny song  about, uh, King Gimp at the Oscars.  You know the story.  Uh, they announced, uh, the winner of the short documentary.  Mm-hmm.  And it was, uh, and it was, uh, a movie called King Gimp.  That's going to be on HBO next month. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, King Gimp himself was there in his wheelchair, and he was so excited that he,  uh, he fell out of his wheelchair, and it took forever.  Yeah.  For them to get him back in his wheelchair.  And it was all on TV.  Uh, over a billion people watching the Oscars.  Everyone was in shock.  In shock that he was on the floor like a flounder.  Right.  We personally have seen the clip at least 20 times in our back office.  With that said, uh, here's Billy and Paul from AirSick.net. 
[02:05:30]  King Gimp keeps falling on his head.  It happens every time the Oscar winner's red.  Throws a spastic fit.  Oh, King Gimp keeps falling on his head.  He keeps falling.  So one minute, he's just sitting in his chair.  The next thing you know, he's on the floor, flopping everywhere. 
[02:06:00]  Drooling from his mouth.  Oh, King Gimp keeps falling on his head.  He keeps falling.  Oh, let's watch the Gimp go.  They tried so hard to get him.  Oh, forget him.  It's Oscar time.  Just leave him there and don't mention him. 
[02:06:30]  King Gimp keeps falling on his head.  The next time you see him, I bet he'll have a helmet on his head.  King Gimp is the one.  Cause I'm never gonna stop laughing at his flopping.  Because he won.  God damn, that was fun. 
[02:07:00]  I like that one.  Very good.  Could it be one of the most offensive songs?  No.  They're working on one for the most offensive songs.  Are they?  Another one.  A follow-up to Kill a Fetus.  But there you have it.  Billy Hine and Paul Bond from airsick.net.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  There's a little email here about King Gimp.  Yeah.  His name is Dan Keplinger.  And in Dan's own words, he dreams of doing things. 
[02:07:30]  He wants to skydive.  He wants to skydive?  What would that look like?  I think it would just look like somebody falling without a parachute.  Floppen wants to skydive, loves to paint, and dreams of finding love.  And he loves to make popcorn, too.  And we'll see that on the HBO viewing of that.  All right.  King Gimp.  Tom from Hofstra has an early FU, Anthony, on the instant feedback. 
[02:08:00]  A big FU to Cablevision for switching all the goddamn channels on my TV.  I went to put on The Daily Show last night, and the effing Golden Girls was on.  They screwed up all the channels.  I hate that.  I don't know why they have to do that.  They switched.  They swapped channels for some reason.  And I was, like, trying to find the Nick game, and now MSG is lifetime.  It's just a cluster F.  It sucks.  And they say it's for some FCC reason, but I think it's just a F with us.  Yeah.  What's the big deal?  Why would you have to swap Comedy Central and whatever? 
[02:08:30]  UPN.  Like, why?  Because when you're flipping around the channels like that, right?  Yeah.  I mean, you know where to go.  Nick game, channel 15.  Yeah.  E, behind the music.  No, behind the music, 30.  VH1.  MTV, 29.  E, 35.  MTV has been 29 for as long as I can remember.  Oh, now it's 50, Anthony.  Yeah.  I believe.  Right.  Comedy Central, it was 45 forever.  Cartoon Network, 46.  I go to the Cartoon Network.  Now it's like the Discovery Channel. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  A mess.  Fat guy's on the line.  All right.  All right.  Fat guy.  Hello, boy.  How are you?  Hello, Billy.  Well, thank you for playing our song.  That was very kind of you.  Okay.  Now listen.  Now listen.  Is there something else going on that lets you know him out?  Now, you don't have to say your piece, but we just figured we'd get the real story from you  because Paul was being polite and Billy doesn't care.  He'll say anything.  You don't really care.  No, mama. 
[02:09:30]  How do you like?  Oh, what?  I'm sorry.  Oh, man.  By the way, I know I've only written one or two songs in my life, but you know, Mike DiNicoli,  now that's a real lyricist.  You know, we can write one friggin' NBA tune, but he's a real lyricist.  You know what?  Kiss my friggin' fat ass.  How much we gonna blow our own friggin' horns on the radio, guys?  Okay.  If you can bend down, don't give me this crap.  You guys sound so funny.  Hey, Billy, what? 
[02:10:00]  Tell me what?  Tell you what.  No, I'm sorry.  Like Paul said, I hope you should hear your voice.  Oh, a whole week of Jay Moore.  That was sarcasm.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, it is our show.  We have on who we want.  You know what, guys?  No, that's correct.  It is.  It is your show.  It's just like when you guys come in, you know, you guys come in because we want you here.  That's all.  If we didn't want Jay Moore in, we would tell him so.  Hey, look.  Okay.  No problem.  And all the people associated with the show, they don't have to get along with each other, 
[02:10:30]  but we just know there's tension between the Jay Moore.  Look, the guy doesn't even know I exist, so it's not even fair.  Okay.  But why do you guys dislike him so?  Well, would you rather do this now, or do you want to do it, like, maybe next week when  he's there?  Oh, wow.  Was it something that happened?  It's just we don't, I can't say we.  Let me speak for myself.  Okay.  You know, not only do, you know, we guys, you know, have the relationship on the air, but,  you know, off the air, we appreciate everything you do, and we like you guys. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, sure.  And I just don't personally appreciate some of the crap that goes on, and maybe you guys  don't say nothing about it or aren't aware of it, but, you know, it's a lot of BS.  Like?  A lot of stuff going on the air and off the air.  It's like, you know, let's, oh, let's show how everyone, how wonderful I am in Rascals  Monday, Rascals Monday, Rascals Monday.  You know, so, you know, like, you know, it's like a whore.  You guys are like his bitch.  Whoa.  Let me, oh, I'm in town.  Let me go to Bobby and Andy and sell out a room. 
[02:11:30]  He's called just to hang with us, too.  Look, guys, no problem.  I don't know the guy, personally.  I couldn't, I wouldn't know if I tripped over one of his bad movies.  But you guys really don't like him.  Yeah, because I think on the other hand, regardless of how many times he does plug the shows he's  doing, he has given us some really good radio.  Hey, guys, no problem.  Look, look, look.  I'm just saying, you know, from my personal standpoint.  All right.  I'm just taking his side because he's not here.  That's all.  Oh, look.  I personally would love to see a fight club between you and Jay. 
[02:12:00]  I wish one of his little minions would call up and get him on the phone.  His little boys are probably hanging around him somewhere.  See, because I don't get the, I can understand what you're saying because, you know, looking  in on it and you see what was going on and how you interpret it or how it really is.  Whatever.  No, I'm just saying, but why does that get you so angry about him?  Yeah, because we support you guys and we promote you guys as much as we can, right?  Of course.  I have no problem with you guys.  It's almost like.  Oh, okay.  Not a big problem. 
[02:12:30]  No.  I don't know.  It just seems like.  Wow.  This is fun.  This is great.  Yeah.  Well, we'll have him on next week.  You know, just ask Stephen Lynch the next time he goes into a hotel room, who's bent  over with their big brown spot looking at him.  Oh, yeah, that's normal behavior.  When somebody comes in that I only met in a radio room, I'll sit there and show my butthole  to them.  Well, you're referring to the time Stephen Lynch went to Jay's hotel room in Boston and 
[02:13:00]  Jay opened the door, well, Stephen Lynch opened the door and had a look at Jay's brown  eye.  On all fours, Brendan.  I thought all guys did that when they first meet.  Yeah, I'm sure Anthony did that when you first went up to Boston.  But why does that bother you?  It doesn't bother me.  It's just very strange behavior, don't you think?  Yeah, but it makes for good radio.  Okay.  You know, you guys.  Strange behavior.  Now you're making me sound like a little, like the zilted boyfriend here, for Christ's  sake.  No, no, no. 
[02:13:30]  I am just taking the other side.  That's all.  Okay.  Because he's not here.  I just wanted to know if there was an issue that we didn't know about.  Yeah.  Well, there might be.  There is.  What is it?  I think I'd rather do it face-to-face.  And let's have Rick pull some tape on certain things, and we'll bring our little weapons.  Wow.  You know, and like I said, it's not fair that Jay's not here.  All right.  You know, let him sell out rascals, and then we'll talk on Tuesday.  You know, and bring all his, you know, everything, I'm sure everything will be wonderful, and 
[02:14:00]  it'll be God's gift or whatever.  Okay.  And I think it'll be fun.  Let's set a date, and let's have a little love fest.  So you definitely have an issue.  You definitely have some ammunition, and you want to take on Jay face-to-face, or on the  phone, or whatever.  Well, whatever.  You know, I think it would be better that way.  It's only fair.  Like you said, it's not fair that he's not here.  All right.  He'll defend himself.  Okay.  You know, he can call, get Buddy Hackett on the phone.  All right.  What's wrong with that?  No, I'm kidding.  Now I'm just throwing crap at you guys.  Now you're pissing me off.  Oh, stop it.  Buddy Hackett's giving us some fun right now. 
[02:14:30]  Buddy Hackett is a legend.  I have nothing, no problem with Buddy Hackett.  Don't even start that.  All right.  Buddy Hackett was a pisser with you guys.  Okay.  Now I'm sitting there going like, oh, look at Fankett.  He's a little crying little bitch.  No, the listeners aren't saying that.  No, Fat Guy, I will be honest with you.  We try to be honest as much as we can on the show here.  Okay.  Line seven, Joe, I agree with Fat Guy.  Dave, line nine, I am with Billy.  No more Jay Moore.  Line one, Will wants to defend Jay. 
[02:15:00]  Okay.  Another guy's picking up for Jay.  So it's like 50-50 right now as far as just looking at the phones.  Hey, look, guys, you know how we feel about you personally, professionally.  I just knew there was a problem last time you guys were here,  and we had Jay on the phone.  It was so uncomfortable, and I was pissed at myself that I didn't bring it up while Jay was on the phone  because you guys were just staring right through me.  Oh, but I didn't even realize.  And you guys both had your arms folded like, you know, oh, we have to deal with this guy again.  At that point, it wasn't the O.B. and Anthony show anymore. 
[02:15:30]  It was the Jay Moore show, and we wouldn't know if we were guests.  Well, we allow people to take a little control of the show from time to time.  You know, it's not easy to do five hours of talk every day,  so when we get someone like Jay or you guys coming in or Stephen Lynch,  it's kind of a pleasure to, you know, rest a little bit and let you guys shine a little bit.  Look, I think it will be very interesting.  I think, like Paul said before, there are two faces to a lot of people.  All right.  Would you like to take on a few of the Jay supporters?  I would love to talk to them, sure.  Really?  Okay, hold on. 
[02:16:00]  Let's go to Will.  Hey, Will.  Hey, what's up?  You're on with Fat Guy, and you want to defend Jay Moore.  Yeah, Jay Moore is God, okay?  So, you know what?  So, you know, he does the gay thing, so what?  You know, forget about it, you know?  But he got two cousins to kiss.  He's got many lesbians on that couch.  And what has Billy from Air Sticks done?  He's taken a crunch and a freaking toilet, and that's about it.  That was pretty funny, too, though, man.  I got to stick up for Fat Guy.  When he took a crunch on Spaz's paycheck, that was very funny. 
[02:16:30]  You know, what's your name, dude?  Will.  Will.  You know, Will, you're making it like, you know, like, who's done more for the show?  And that's not what it comes down to.  You know, what it comes down to is, like, we respect Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  We respect, you know, what they do, what we do for them, what they do for us.  It's like, you know, and it's like, yeah, you guys can think he's funny.  We have no problem with that.  He probably is very funny.  But, like, before you're like.  You don't even want to admit it, huh, Billy?  What?  He's come up with some funny stuff.  I have never seen his act.  His act is really good.  Yeah, I'm sure the guys who we got it from are a little hot, very happy for us. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, okay.  All right, now we're getting to the issue.  Jeff from River Edge, New Jersey.  Jay Moore is a spotlight hog.  He really does monopolize airtime.  The incessant kissing ass of Buddy Hackett is annoying.  I agree with Fat Guy.  Wow.  That's one coming in.  Rock from Woodside sounds like someone is jealous that his spotlight is threatened.  All right, I guess that's coming in for a. . .  I guess I was going to do a Jay Moore plug.  Yes. 
[02:17:30]  It's right down the middle, though, Billy.  That's cool.  It's like 50-50.  Fat Guy's right.  For one thing, Jay steps on Ant's voices all the time.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, Jay Moore rules.  This guy is just jealous.  I mean, it's totally down the middle.  Well, then this sounds like fun, doesn't it?  It could be a good time.  You know what?  Jeff from River Edge, New Jersey.  Jay Moore should visit Camp Concentration.  Oh, my goodness.  But then the next one. . .  Next one says, Jay is the man.  I really like when Jay comes in the studio.  Just don't have him in every day for a week. 
[02:18:00]  Fat Guy.  Fat Guy is the man, too.  But with the most important email, Joe from North Arlington.  Spaz is a retard.  We've got to keep focused here.  All right, hold on.  I want to get you on with Jeff who wants to defend Jay.  Okay.  Let's go with Jeff.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  The way I see it, I think there's a lot of shell space to go around.  And it's almost like Fat Boy.  You're kind of being like the jealous girlfriend, almost.  No, I'm coming across as the bitch who got left out, you know, didn't go to the prom. 
[02:18:30]  That's what it seems like.  I mean, Jay's hilarious, man.  There have been shows where, you know, he's made the show almost.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, you know, I was kind of on hold there for a second hearing all those instant feedbacks.  And a lot of them make sense.  Let me ask you a question.  We're hoping it'd be funny before Jay showed up.  Hell, yeah.  Oh, okay.  But, hey, he adds to the show.  I'm not saying he makes the show.  I think your stuff is funny, too.  We have no problem letting other people shine on the show, which is very different than other high-profile shows in this town. 
[02:19:00]  I don't know.  You know what?  Maybe there's more to it that we don't get on the outside here.  But, you know, you kind of sound like angry about something that we're not seeing.  Jay's funny.  He's like that out-of-control guy that, like, just let him do his thing and it's worthwhile.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  So, Billy, will you be representing Billy and Paul?  I can't speak for Paul, but if the invitations are, I know for a fact Paul had an issue or two that might want to be brought up.  Yeah, I could feel that on the phone today.  And I know for a fact that Paul actually has people to back up some of his things, and they might be calling in. 
[02:19:30]  And we need to hear some issues.  Yeah, you promise, Fat Guy, you'll let it out, and we'll get right down to what's in the room.  Well, you know, that would be a little different for me.  I'm not usually very open to how I feel.  Okay.  Yeah, Billy, a lot of people saying that you have some kind of a gay love thing for Jay.  And it sounds to me like the fact I wanted to hob Jay's knob, but Jay said no from Larry and Yonk.  Well, I understand that would never happen. 
[02:20:00]  I don't think Jay would ever say no.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, but that's different from him chasing Haley Jo Osmond around the hotel room, right, Ant?  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Now, you let me know.  When is Rick getting back?  Monday.  All right, because it's a week.  No, Tuesday, Tuesday.  Tuesday, okay, cool.  Hey, Fat Boy, one other thing.  You got it?  Fat Guy, by the way.  Fat Guy.  One other thing, man.  I think if you're going to take Jay on, you've got to polish it a little bit, because he's quick and witty, you know what I mean? 
[02:20:30]  Of course.  So what should I do?  Should I, like, go into, like, Rocky training over there again?  I don't know.  I mean, you said you're going to pull out some weapons.  You've got some ideas.  I'd bring some strong ideas, you know what I mean?  Okay.  It could make for some interesting radio next week.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  See you.  You know, I think, you know, something like this would be better done in person, boys.  Hey!  So you want to be in studio?  Yeah, sure.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I mean, you know me.  I certainly don't have a problem with it. 
[02:21:00]  That guy, I do bow to you.  You have balls.  It seems like something like this, it would be easier to do on the phone.  That would be the easy way out, wouldn't it?  You want to be face-to-face.  Yeah.  As if whether Jay wants to, that's another story.  Well, like I said, he doesn't even know who the...  He probably doesn't even know who he knows, Paul.  They work together and stuff.  Yeah.  But from what the hell I know, I'm just a fleck on his ass.  Well, I know, you know.  All right.  He probably doesn't know me from a hole in the wall, so he probably wouldn't even know  where the hell it's coming from.  All right, we'll see if we can set this up for like two...  Just remember, my only thing with you, with him, comes from our relationship and his 
[02:21:30]  relationship with how it deals with you.  Okay.  And, I mean, other things I have heard, some things that I know from the comedy community.  We have no problem...  I know you guys don't back away from conflict.  Are you kidding me?  No, but we have no problem with Jay.  You know?  No, not at all.  Well, we would have said something a long time ago.  Mm-hmm.  No, that's the truth.  Okay.  All right.  I just wonder if you had your nuts today, that's all.  What are you talking about?  Are you going to bring your balls next week or what? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, my God.  That guy, what are you getting at?  No, I'm teasing with you.  No, what are you...  But what are you getting at?  No, I don't know.  You know, if there's something you wanted to be free...  Would you...  If you had a problem with somebody, would you actually come out and say it?  I believe I have in the past, sure.  Oh, okay.  As I sit here, I don't have a problem with Jay Moore.  Okay.  I don't have a problem when he, you know, takes over the show a little bit here and there.  I have no problem with it.  Oh, that's cool.  All right.  Now, I am really feeling like a dick, no?  No, you're not, because it's right down the middle.  It'll be interesting.  But I'm serious.  I have no problem with it. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, cool, cool.  Anyway, this should make...  It'll make definitely for some interesting afternoon gossip.  And I have no problem with you either, so...  Of course.  I'm so lovable.  Sue from Jersey, checking in real quick.  I'll tell Billy to go get another pipe.  Who opened for Jay during his stint at Rascals?  Wasn't it Paul?  Yeah.  Oh, well.  And Paul did very, very, very well.  Yeah.  I'm kind of pissed that I didn't see his whole set.  So...  What does that have to do with anything?  I don't know.  That's just Sue speaking her... 
[02:23:00]  A lot of people...  Her pace.  ...like Paul.  Yeah, I mean, it's not a question.  You know, look.  You know, a lot of...  A lot of people want to see who likes Sue and who likes what.  You know, comedy is as diverse as anything.  Right.  Right.  Some people like others.  Some people won't, you know.  And I think what Paul was hearing earlier was me just throwing around some sarcasm.  Oh, okay.  Because, I mean, the show does get a little gayer when Jay's here.  So I was like, oh, boy, you know, can't wait to get back into the gay zone.  You know, I'm just throwing the sarcasm around.  Well, you did exercise the demons there for a while. 
[02:23:30]  No, but when it comes right down, I definitely enjoy when Jay's on the show.  Okay, cool.  All right.  It's a pleasure, and I look forward to next week.  This could be great.  Oh, yeah.  I'll have to go into the studio now.  All right, Bill.  Bye, guys.  Have a great weekend.  All right.  Later, man.  Bye.  There he goes.  Interesting.  All right.  Let's get ready to rumble.  That would be interesting.  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  Hey, dude.  How are you, Joe? 
[02:24:00]  Show rules, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  You know, being an Italian guy from Brooklyn like me, you wouldn't know anything about this,  of course.  But when they change the channel, they call it that silver bullet thing.  Yeah.  And they do that to zap the boxes that people have that get all the premium channels without  paying for them.  We know the bullet.  But, of course, we don't know anything about that.  I don't think that's what they're doing, though. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  That's exactly what they're doing, and they do it regularly, and that's the reason.  Beautiful.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Hey, one more thing.  The fan?  Okay.  Terrific.  Hope you got demoted, and you answered the phone.  And she's, Joe.  Ooh.  Nice hint.  Thank you.  All right, Joe.  Okay, dude.  We've got to get back to the game here.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Game point.  Oh, petered out over the net.  That was interesting, though. 
[02:25:00]  I knew there was a little tension there, and it's nice that it'll all come out in the  wash next week.  Should be good.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  We'll regroup more of your phone calls in just a bit.  We're moving on from the Jay Moore fat guy issue.  We'll let those guys, you know, deal with that next week, okay?  Hash it out.  Anything else, give us a call.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, can we get these illiterates off the air, please? 
[02:25:30]  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Wham.  Oops, that was the end of that one.  Ah.  We want to rock after commercials.  There we go.  We got to acknowledge the huge wow sign outside the Midtown Tunnel. 
[02:26:00]  A lot of people calling in about that.  Thank you, guys.  Nice.  I guess this is a big construction site, and you guys have a huge wow sign outside the Tunnel.  How about that?  As we get prepared for Wickham out Wednesday, another season of Wickham out Wednesday right  around the corner, Anthony.  We can smell it in the air.  We got the brand new wow stickers.  Smell the boobs.  We have over 100,000 that are going to hit the tri-state area.  They're much cooler than last year.  We're very excited about the new wow stickers.  Yes. 
[02:26:30]  You'll be proud to display these on your rides, and we're encouraging you, if you want one,  to send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  They're still being printed.  You know, it's going to take a couple weeks, but you might as well, you know, get your self-addressed  stamped envelope in immediately.  Just put, you know, wow on the envelope, all right, and send it to 888 7th Avenue.  10th floor.  10th floor or something.  10th floor, and address it to your bunghole. 
[02:27:00]  New York, New York, 10106, I believe.  I got that right?  Self-addressed stamped envelope would be greatly appreciated, okay?  Oh, yeah.  Self-addressed, yeah.  Those guys are still funny, man.  Been off the air, like, they haven't made new ones in how long?  And I still, like, occasionally.  I can watch the repeats 24 hours a day.  Great. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Let's go to the phones and see what Brian wants to say.  Brian, what's going on today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  I'm all right.  Good.  Heading west on Sunrise Highway.  Yeah.  I'm on my way to band practice, and some girl, a Camaro next to me.  Now, this is like an 80s Camaro.  Okay.  You know, the 80s chick, like the Bon Jovi.  Well, it is Long Island, you know?  Yeah.  It's like another land out there with the 80s.  They still are racing 80s.  I'm out over by Amityville now. 
[02:28:00]  Obviously on the South Shore, too, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, South Shore.  The LIE is like the Mason-Dixon line on Long Island.  You go down South Shore, oh, my God, the South Shore chicks.  And, ladies, don't get mad.  We love you South Shore girls.  Yeah, if it wasn't for you, we never would have gotten laid back in high school.  Oh, you big-haired whores.  Yeah, so I'm on my way to high school to pick up some chicks.  All right.  So, but anyway, I'm driving down the road, and I look over to my right, and boom, she 
[02:28:30]  lifts up her shirt.  You can't say that word.  You can't say it.  Ugliest boobs you've ever seen in your life?  Ugliest boobs I've ever seen.  Ugliest boobs.  But wasn't it still cool?  Yeah, it was cool.  Okay.  So I figured I'd give you guys a call.  All right.  Well, thank you.  It's a bust of the field's rules.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Bye.  Bye.  Okay.  Come in.  Okay.  Come in.  Come in.  Come in. 
[02:29:00]  Come in.  Virgin.  Come in.  Virgin.  Come in.  Come in.  Okay.  Come in.  Virgin.  Come in.  I hope someone else finds that stuff, buddy.  I love Scott, though, man.  Hilarious.  Let's go to Ron.  Ron, you're next on WNAW.  How are you?  Hey, what's up, dude?  How you doing?  Good.  I don't know if you got my story.  No.  I'm not too sure.  This is totally off the topic. 
[02:29:30]  Okay.  That's all right.  But I had just gotten a recent bill in the mail, only because I apparently have a problem  with talking on the phone to the girls who like to charge me for it.  Wait.  It says here you got a $15,000 phone sex bill?  Yeah.  It was over three credit cards.  Whoa.  Why are you calling the phone sex numbers?  Oh, who the hell?  Well, you know what?  I just got divorced.  You know?  And you know what? 
[02:30:00]  I moved into an apartment.  Everything was great.  Everything was nice.  Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron.  Let me stop you.  Do you realize what you can get for $15,000 if you just got divorced?  Well, I don't know.  Maybe I could take some of the Anthony's stock tips or something and make some money off of it.  I don't know.  Not today.  Did you spend $15,000 or somebody else, like, rooked your cards?  No.  No.  I actually went through every single bit of it.  Yeah.  You, yourself?  Yeah.  I did it in four months.  I don't get the phone sex lines. 
[02:30:30]  You know, I just sit down there and I talk and I...  I hear all those party lines are all gay guys, though.  No.  They're not gay guys.  I'm serious.  Hello.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Hello.  Hello.  Ding dong.  Hello.  Anyone else in here?  Hello.  Remember that time with the scanner?  Hello.  Hello, Ron.  You there?  Ding.  I have this scanner and you can pick up all kinds of fun stuff on it.  Illegally.  But, you know, whatever.  Whatever.  And occasionally, inadvertently, I might pick up a cell phone call, you know?  Oops. 
[02:31:00]  Oops.  And you hear something.  And then you can hear, you hear this guy talking to one of these phone sex things.  Yeah.  It's like a room that a bunch of guys get in and there's a...  I guess you push a key on your phone and it goes ding dong.  Yeah.  To tell other people you're there.  Other people that you're there.  In all fairness, we didn't know it was a gay sex.  Yeah, yeah.  It could have been, you know, one of these party rooms that were supposed to have girls.  Yeah, yeah.  But it was all guys.  I'm hoping to hear some girls in there.  It was a gay. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, dear.  All you hear was ding dong, ding dong, ding dong.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Ding dong.  Hello.  Hello.  So that's how you chalked up 15 grand?  Yeah, yeah.  I did that in four months, dude.  I can't...  And it's not like, you know, I had my pants around my ankles, you know, singing, you know,  Judy Garland songs doing this.  You know, I just, you know, it just happened.  So I need 15 grand.  Well, good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  You're not going to help me.  Well, Joe said he'll help you on line one.  Joe, what's going on? 
[02:32:00]  You're on with Ron.  Oh, Ron.  Yeah.  What the hell's wrong with you, man?  Dude, I don't know.  15 grand?  Yeah, 15 grand.  You are a loser, bro.  No, no.  It's $14,875.  Oh, boy.  Let's just cut it short a little.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I don't know.  I guess I'm somewhat redone.  Joe, have you ever called a phone sex line?  No.  No.  I'll rent a movie.  It's a lot cheaper.  No, dude.  It's not like phone sex.  It's like you get on a line with a bunch of people.  You've got to pay 15 grand to get a friend, man. 
[02:32:30]  You've got a lot more problems than being divorced.  Yeah, did any of these girls get you off in the party room there, Ron?  No, no.  Oh, what a waste.  Dude, dude.  Go rent a whore.  You can get a whore a lot cheaper.  All right, Joe.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  All right.  Well, sorry, Ron.  So you're not going to give me 15 grand?  Yeah.  Yeah, let me just pull it out of my butt.  Kat, what's going on?  Oh, nothing, man.  I'm just going to tell you that this guy's a total loser.  You can get anything for free on the computer. 
[02:33:00]  What's wrong with him?  You don't have a computer?  You could have bought a few of them.  You could have bought a kick-ass computer for 15 grand.  I probably could have bought my wife back for 15 grand.  No, you know what you do?  You get on the phone with the company or whatever it is, and you just tell them it wasn't you.  You say it was somebody else, and then they put a block on your phone for those calls,  and you're not liable for the money.  Okay.  All right.  So you're telling me to lie.  Well, there's one more guy that wants to talk to you. 
[02:33:30]  TJ?  Yeah, how are you doing, guys?  You work for an escort agency?  Yes, I do.  All right.  You got some advice for Ron?  Yeah.  You know what, Ron?  Ron, this is ridiculous.  15 grand, you didn't get anything out of it.  You know, for 150 bucks, I could deliver a fine-looking broad.  In all honesty, I did get some of it.  I did get something out of it.  I'm not believing Ron's story, to tell you the truth.  Oh, my God.  I think Ron is faking this.  Ron, hang up the phone and shoot yourself.  Shoot myself? 
[02:34:00]  Yes, you should shoot yourself.  All right.  I got a rubber band.  All right, TJ.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Ron, I'm going to cut you off before you say Bob-a-boo here.  I'm not believing Ron Stone.  No, no.  All right.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're next on NEW.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  What's this joker's name?  Ron.  Ron, you're not alone, my friend.  I mean, not that I charged that 15 grand.  I'll tell you, I used to be nice.  I used to go away on company business trips, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, the bill all gets expensed, and, you know, he's sliding up the phone calls 
[02:34:30]  on, you're all set.  So you've done the phone sex, too, while you're away?  Oh, all the time.  We used to call him from the job trailers, like the Supers trailer, outside the job sites.  When he wasn't in there, you'd pick up his phone and dial, like, sex lines.  Really?  It's pretty funny.  But, like, nothing that would ever come of it.  I would talk, be on the phone, and be like, hey, what's up?  Hi.  All right.  What are you going to do for me?  I got, like, five minutes here. 
[02:35:00]  Well, what are you into?  What do you like?  What are your hobbies?  I'm like, hobbies?  Start talking about knob-hobbing or something.  It's time is money here.  But nothing ever came of it.  And then, you know, an electrician would grab the phone, give me some, like a phone whore.  They asked you to describe yourself at the beginning.  They just tried to drag it out.  Well, they want to make as much money as possible.  Sure.  So, okay, Chris, thank you.  Yeah.  Hey, brother, you're not alone.  All right.  Brother being Ron there.  Ron.  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  You're next on WNAW. 
[02:35:30]  Joe?  Hello.  Hey.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Joe?  You guys are the coolest, man.  Hey, I've seen Wow on Channel 7.  On Channel 7?  Channel 7, it's all Wow.  This sounds like a phony tip.  Yeah?  And, uh...  Yeah?  Yeah?  Hey, you guys got to play more of that spaz radio.  That's the funniest crap I've ever heard.  Spaz radio rocks.  Well, spaz radio...  Spaz radio rocks, especially that rerun of today when he walked out.  The spaz radio will be back Friday. 
[02:36:00]  He's doing his week in review.  The spaz week in review Friday on the radio show.  All right.  One more thing.  Oh, here it comes.  Uh, what was I going to say now?  I forgot.  Okay.  Okay.  How you doing?  Joey.  Okay.  You're wasting valuable radio time.  Please.  I'm so butthead.  All right.  Okay, good.  Let's go to, uh...  Dan and Celeste are upstairs?  Dan.  Celeste.  Hello?  All right.  Bring them down.  Remember Celeste, Dan? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  The girl that, uh, we got to see naked when she was, uh...  She was pregnant.  When she was pregnant.  She's not pregnant now.  And we, uh, try to induce labor.  Yeah.  Remember they were banging in another studio.  Uh-huh.  She was over nine months pregnant.  Yes.  She was making her do jumping jacks and walking...  Right.  ...up and down stairs.  Sure.  ...and doing deep squats and all sorts of stuff.  Yeah.  All naked.  Well, uh, they're upstairs and she's no longer pregnant.  No?  No.  Well, yeah, she was pregnant for like a year.  Did they go away? 
[02:37:00]  They're up here?  All right.  Let's, uh, you want to take a break or are they going to be down real fast?  Are they coming right in?  They come right in and we don't have to take it.  Remember the thunder of like when he took off right there?  It was like...  That's amazing.  We ought to mic the floor.  You know, a lot of you guys, a lot of you guys hate spaz, you know?  I'm a big fan of spaz.  Sometimes, you know, we'll be running around, you know, we're busy in the office and we ask  spaz to go to McDonald's or something.  The guy doesn't walk to McDonald's.  He sprints.  Ben and I were coming back from lunch and, and all of a sudden this, this guy comes running 
[02:37:30]  by us where it's like, he was running so fast.  It was a blur.  Like Clark Kent looking for a phone booth.  So out of the corner of my eye, I go, Ben, I think that's spaz.  I go, spaz.  And he turns around and I go, where are you going?  He goes, I got to go to McDonald's real fast.  The guy takes his job serious.  He works his ass off.  Oh, yeah.  He hustles.  He's the best.  I mean, he's got a brain in his head.  I mean, he's a retard and all that.  Yeah, don't get us wrong.  But the damn guy, you know, he's passionate about what he does around here. 
[02:38:00]  What?  She's got the care with him?  The kids, they have kids.  They have kids.  I'm seeing this girl naked.  I guess they're not going to see her naked.  Yeah, we'll get her naked in front of the kids.  Oh, that's wrong.  There's Dan.  Look at this.  What a straw in there.  That's the kid that was in Celeste when she was dancing naked for us?  Wow, look at the little bugger.  Let's see.  All right.  Yeah, that's a baby, all right.  Let me see.  Wow, that kid, you got shaken up.  Boy, we saw you when you were inside there. 
[02:38:30]  How old's the kid now, Celeste?  Three months.  Three months on the first.  Three months on the first?  It was three months ago we were trying to induce labor?  Yep.  Wow.  I had him exactly January 1st.  You did have him January 1st?  Yep.  How close to being, you know, right before midnight?  6.35 p.m.  P.m.?  Oh, for you, I don't work. 
[02:39:00]  What?  What happened?  What?  We're just hanging out with Dan and Celeste.  They brought in their two little kids.  The newborn's three months old.  How old's the other one?  Friend makes me think I'm not sick.  Three years old.  Three years old.  At the end of April.  At the end of April.  How cute.  Because of where I like to dip my stick.  That's wrong.  And I always talk about the day.  Oh, come on. 
[02:39:30]  You're the worst, man.  What?  I thought we were all just having fun.  I thought we were all just having fun.  I wish that thing could somehow understand.  What, guys?  They're in here with their young children.  Yes?  And you're playing this, uh, one of the most defensive songs ever written.  I don't know what you're talking about, Anthony.  Somehow they just can't see you again.  Hey, where are you guys going? 
[02:40:00]  Don't leave us.  You're the worst, man.  Oh, come on.  It's Simpson's nose, make me wet.  Baby raper.  I'm a baby raper.  So sweet and yum.  They're good enough to eat.  You're the worst, man.  Baby raper.  Oh, come on.  Get this off. 
[02:40:30]  I'm a baby raper.  There's babies in the studio.  Come on, man.  What?  It takes on a whole new life.  Mike, what's up?  You just put this song over the top.  I thought the KKK song had it, but this live war.  I'm sure my stomach is hurting when that song came out.  No, this is horrible, man.  Sing them songs.  What? 
[02:41:00]  What did you do?  What?  I thought we were all just having fun.  This is the radio show, right?  Booties on their feet.  Oh, come on.  Baby raper.  I'm a baby raper.  So sweet and yum.  They're good enough to eat.  Danny.  What's up?  What's up, Danny?  Now you come in there and just reel you in the head. 
[02:41:30]  That's so wrong.  He is the worst.  I mean, come on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you hung up on him.  What?  No, I didn't.  The phone does.  You have got to be the most disturbed individual.  Mike, what's up?  This piece of tape makes it number one.  Baby raper.  Sweet and yum.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  God damn.  What?  Jesus.  That is just wrong, man.  So, hi, Dan. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, it's good to see you, too, man.  It's good to see you.  Okay.  Terrific.  God damn.  Okay.  Horrific.  You are awful.  They come in here with a newborn.  They want to share with us.  And you play that song.  I didn't play nothing.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  It was good to see you guys, too.  Here's a gift for you to torture.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Each time I see a little girl, eight or nine or ten, 
[02:42:30]  I think this year is to stick my tongue in sound.  I'm all in.  For little girls, for little girls, have hairless limits.  Come on, man.  Why?  You are so friggin' wrong.  I get my hat on alcohol and pot.  Dennis from Brooklyn, Satan is coming for you, Opie. 
[02:43:00]  And John from Queens, Opie, you are the Antichrist.  What's the name of the newborn?  Patrick Aaron.  Yeah, what's, what's, what's, what's, I don't even know.  Is it a girl or a boy?  It's a boy.  Patrick Aaron.  There you go.  Okay.  Jeez, man.  You have a problem.  What?  You have issues.  What?  Hi, James.  What's up?  Nothing much, guys. 
[02:43:30]  Okay.  Oh, that was perfect timing, man.  Okay.  Perfect timing.  And it gets Joe there to play a good cop, man.  Oh, my God.  And the kid's talking and stuff.  How you doing?  Jesus Christ.  For little girls, I bite them, and I make them lick my bones.  They're little nips.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  I'm going to give you a doll to torture, but you won't even...  Well, get on the mic.  It was nice that you guys stopped by before your vacation. 
[02:44:00]  You got to get on the mic.  No, it's in the mirror, Celeste.  Yeah, get on the mic.  Steve, what's up?  I was on the mic.  Steve.  Opie, you are going to hell.  What?  It's Rosie.  Hello?  Yeah.  You're going to hell, man.  Why?  That is the sickest stuff I've ever heard in my life.  I almost threw up in the car.  Well, I don't know.  You know what?  I've lost all respect to you, man, after doing that.  I thought you were really cool and funny.  Now I think you're really sick in the head.  I don't know who started that song right when she was walking in the studio with her baby. 
[02:44:30]  It was you, man.  No, it wasn't.  It was you.  Uh-oh.  What?  I think the kid's going to start crying.  She's over.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh.  That's great.  You are so bad.  How could you look at those kids and...  Oh, man. 
[02:45:00]  You are so bad.  I did nothing, man.  I was always wondering who was worse, Hitler or Opie.  Well, it's clear now.  Opie.  I did nothing.  Ellen, what's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  Hey, Ellen.  This is Ellen.  Ellen, what's up?  Yo.  Ellen?  You got a lot of balls, man.  That song, I'm giving it a vote.  It came in perfect timing. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  Thank you, Ellen.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  No wonder they wrote Ellen.  Ellen is about 10.  Okay.  So, we have Celeste and Dan in the studio.  So, very good.  I see everything went well.  We have a healthy, cute little baby right there.  When was you born?  January 1st.  January 1st.  How overdue?  Way over.  A few weeks.  A few weeks.  Yeah.  Well, we remember because we were trying to induce that labor before Christmas. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Anthony, Roman Polanski.  Roman Polanski checking in?  Yeah, Roman Polanski checking in.  And I'm the one who had to leave the country.  Before you guys hang me, there's no way the little ones were able to hear that song.  Oh, really?  And why?  At least stick up for me with that.  I'm not sticking up for you for anything.  You are so bad, man.  There was no way they could hear it.  Right, Dan?  That's, uh, yeah. 
[02:46:30]  That's true.  Thank you.  Hope he is heartless.  Anyhow, we stopped by to thank you guys for your hospitality all this time.  And I hope he gets syndicated because we're going to be living in South Florida now.  Oh, when you're moving.  When you're moving.  Uh, we leave Saturday.  Really?  That quick?  Yeah.  I thought you guys were just going on vacation.  Nah.  I didn't know you were leaving us.  I'm afraid so, man.  What are you doing down there?  Yeah, what are you going to do down there?  Uh, computer technician.  Really?  Yeah.  Meaning you're going to be running the website.  Uh, pretty much anybody from Dell or, uh, Compaq or anybody that has problems, they call 
[02:47:00]  people and I'll be one of those people.  Oh.  Well, so I...  Are you, uh, hanging up your, uh, career as, uh...  As a, uh, as a nude...  Magazine?  As a nude pregnant model?  Kind of put it on hold.  Yeah.  The milk production wasn't all there, so, uh, couldn't do nothing with that.  Yeah, let me, let me stick up for myself.  These two are sick ass and sons.  Come on.  They're obviously good parents.  I could see that just looking at them, but they are sick ass when the kids aren't around.  Well, there's a lot of, uh, call for it out there, so we, uh... 
[02:47:30]  I mean, Celeste has some pictures on a website that will just...  Virgin.  I don't think so.  Oh, people want to hang you up.  I had nothing to do with that answer.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So.  Well, you guys are leaving Saturday.  That's great.  Yeah, man.  So, when's the syndication start?  I want to be able to hear you down there without having to call and be on hold.  Um, good question. 
[02:48:00]  You'll have to keep track through the, uh, the website for a while.  What else?  Somebody emailing in.  Opie, Opie, Opie.  Hang them from a tree.  Look at that.  And, uh, is it Miami or...  Uh, actually Fort Lauderdale.  Fort Lauderdale.  Very nice town.  Yep.  Yeah, there you go.  You won't have to listen to, uh, horrible songs that Opie's playing in front of your children.  I'm going to miss not listening to you guys every...  Ah, well, hopefully we'll be syndicated.  And I thought it was the Black Crow CD in the CD player.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, my God.  Uh, Dave, what's going on?  Uh, yeah.  Dude, that was worse than when you pulled that old lady that her friend was dead.  Oh, man.  You're the devil.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Anthony on line five.  Anthony.  Opie, you know you're going to do it.  What?  You might as well do it.  Give him a send-off song.  You know you're going to do it.  No, no, no, no, no.  I think we ran out of songs. 
[02:49:00]  Come on, Opie.  You know you're going to do it.  I don't have any more.  Send something for them.  Give him a send-off gift.  Opie, you know he's going to do it.  Yeah, I know.  I have nothing left in my arsenal.  You know who?  All the balls.  All the balls.  Opie, it's Ruben.  You can't say that.  You can't say that.  All right, man.  I'll see you tomorrow.  All right.  Bye.  Bye, boy.  Opie, I could have turned the song off.  Don't even give people that.  They know what this studio looks like. 
[02:49:30]  They've seen it in pictures.  You're right there.  The board is across the whole console from me.  You've got a table.  I'm so far away from you.  It's almost as big as your desk in the office.  How am I supposed to crawl over it?  Patty from Babylon.  What did we learn on the show today?  Surprisingly, Anthony is the sensitive one today.  What happened?  Where's the kid?  He's running around the studio.  All right.  See, if you were a real man, you'd show the kid how the board works and make him hit the 
[02:50:00]  button that starts to sound off.  No, no, no, no, no.  Joe, what's going on?  Nothing.  You did absolutely nothing wrong.  I mean, it sounds perfectly normal to me.  The only thing I worry about is you play a baby raping with a little baby boy.  That scares me.  Oh.  Now, the fact is the kids didn't hear the songs.  And that's the truth.  Oh, that's right.  I believe you 100%.  That was just for the entertainment of our fans at home.  That's right.  Yes.  We believe you.  Thank you, Joe. 
[02:50:30]  Let's go to Kathy.  Kathy, you're next on NAW.  Hi.  Hi.  I guess it's a good thing that Robin Celeste are not black.  Wow, Kathy.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Uh-oh.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to Scott.  Scott, you're next on NAW.  Scott.  Hello.  Hi, what's up?  Yeah.  Opie, that was bad.  Yeah.  That was no good.  Yeah, you got it.  I got it.  You know, you have little kids crying in the background. 
[02:51:00]  That's no good.  Wait.  All right.  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait.  The crying was on tape.  Yeah.  But then after the tape stopped.  Right.  You know, you hear the kids in the background.  Yeah, I know.  All right, Scott.  You guys are going to be playing radio in Iraq.  You got to stop.  All right.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  You boys can't be doing it.  All right.  Oh, he's going back behind there again.  He's going to pull out all the plugs.  All right.  So, this is the G portion of our radio show.  Yeah.  So, the kid's out.  We'll get back to the R version. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, let's see.  How are you doing?  Hey, just try getting rid of us.  How's the belly?  It's better.  Let's see.  Oh, yeah.  Can we see your stuff?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah.  She'll show us.  Now, how long is the cake for?  It's not in front of the kid.  Get rid of the belly.  Get rid of the belly.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  All right.  This is so long.  She just whipped them out.  Okay.  And I'm the sick one.  She just whipped them out.  Well, let's whip them out Wednesday.  But your kid is right over there. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  This is wrong.  There's so many levels.  It's not like they haven't seen them before.  Okay.  We've got to take a break.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Coming.  Yeah.  Virgin.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, guys, thanks for stopping by.  Yeah, thanks, man.  And best of luck in Florida.  Thank you, guys.  Best of luck with the syndication. 
[02:52:30]  Hopefully.  Send us an email every once in a while.  We like to keep track of the listeners that move out of the area.  Hope you like the doll.  Yeah, yeah.  She gave us the Rosie O'Donnell doll.  We hate her as much as about everyone else in the world.  If you could torture it on your next road show, maybe.  That'd be nice.  Okay.  Dreams come true with Rosie.  What a cutie patootie.  Go on.  Give me a kiss.  Look.  It was an unwelcome gift.  Let's put it down.  Rock on, little one. 
[02:53:00]  Dreams come true with Rosie.  All right.  So let's say goodbye to Dan.  Yeah, we'll torture this appropriately.  Thanks.  Rebecca.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Hey, just curious if you were going to tell the kids that there's no Santa Claus now.  Nope.  Sorry.  Already been done.  Hope you already did that.  I didn't.  On a previous show up in Boston.  I never did that.  Much to the horror of many parents listening. 
[02:53:30]  I never did that.  Oh, no.  Not him.  All right.  Thank you, Rebecca.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, so many emails coming in.  Not many in favor of you right now, I'll think.  I had nothing to do with it.  You had everything to do.  I did not.  All right, let's take a break.  Yeah.  We'll take a break, and we'll be back. 
[02:54:00]  We want to thank Dan and Celeste for stopping by, and we wish them luck.  Thank you.  In South Florida.  Talk to you soon.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Hey, I'm John Stewart, and I listen to Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  These guys have problems, but you know that.  Again?  Yes.  I don't know.  We just had a dump out.  Oh, is John in?  I'm not there, and I eat.  We just had a dump out?  Yes.  What almost got through?  F.  Oh, F word.  All right.  Let's start over.  I'm sorry.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the Heart of Little Little.  Yes. 
[02:54:30]  Dreams come true.  Yes.  Rosie.  Rosie's dreaming of going to Paisano and loading up.  Loading up on the wonderful pasta and great huge portions.  What a cutie patootie.  Yes.  She says that veal chop is a cutie patootie.  Come on.  Give me a kiss.  Give.  Yeah.  She just sucked in a whole plate of pasta right there from Paisano.  And she wanted to kiss Pete for bringing it over to her.  Yeah.  And Pete ran away.  We love Paisano. 
[02:55:00]  We're down there all the time.  It's a great place to take a date.  Mm-hmm.  The family.  Mm-hmm.  Like I said, huge portions and really good food, you know?  Reasonable prices, too.  I was surprised when I finally looked at the menu and saw the prices that you could get a huge meal,  and it's not that expensive at all.  And you ask Joey, you say, hey, Joey, let me see the picture of Opie and Anthony.  Did he get the new one up there yet?  I'm not sure.  Oh.  I haven't been there in a few weeks. 
[02:55:30]  Might still be a swan flip one?  Probably.  Well, you just say Opie and Anthony saying you get a free glass of wine.  Dreams come true.  That's right.  That's right, Rosie.  You're an Irish bitch.  You probably get drunk all the time on the wine and stuff, right?  Come on.  Give me a kiss.  Allegedly.  Okay.  I want to shoot this doll.  Already.  It's annoying as hell.  You're a cutie, Patoon.  Okay. 
[02:56:00]  Rock on, little ones.  Ugh.  Dreams come true.  Wait, Ann, Ann.  What?  I'm slamming her big fat head against the console.  All right, Ann.  It's Paisano, Moe Berger.  Yeah.  Yeah, yes, Joey.  The owner.  Moe asked.  Does the kid want to talk?  He's going to do an ad for Paisano.  You want to talk about Paisano, little one?  No, he's just playing.  All right, turn the mic around.  All right.  If you see Joey, just tell him Opie and Anthony sent you.  And Joey.  No.  No.  No. 
[02:56:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  It's some kind of a secret language.  What is he trying to say?  I don't know.  You still don't know?  He's saying Opie is the sickest SOP I've ever seen in my life.  All right.  As for Joey, tell him, hey Joey, Opie and Anthony sent me to your fine restaurant here, Paisano,  and he'll give you a glass of wine on the house, okay? 
[02:57:00]  It's Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart.  Come on.  Give me a kiss.  Of Little Italy.  Give them a call.  9-6-5-1-1-8-8.  That's 9-6-5-1-1-8-8.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2 of it.  You guys won't make it.  Baby, this is a part of it.  Who's that?  1-0-2-7-W-N-W.  All right, Anthony, we only have a few more minutes left here. 
[02:57:30]  For today, anyway.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I believe we can play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Certainly can.  Let's go right to the fellowship and get a few of these people on.  We haven't played this in a while.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  It's Joe Soprano.  What's up?  What's up?  I had a bow with you guys at the bat on past day.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Today I learned that you guys have revived Scott Muni's career. 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  I also learned a sweet name.  Virgin.  I think the full-free number is easier, remember, than any W's.  All right.  Well, thank you, Joe.  Then again, eventually, and long live King Gimp.  All right.  Okay.  Scott, so.  All right, let's go to Bob.  Bob, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up, guys?  How are you, Bob?  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  I learned over the last couple days that there's a new radio station in town.  It's going to be W-O-N-A.  Yeah.  Hell, yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Listen, guys, Monday is my birthday.  Anybody can hang out with Psycho Mark?  We gave all the med tickets away.  If you call tomorrow, we might have some more.  You the man.  We just got to see how many we got.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Have a good one.  Thank you.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, O&A, listen, the quick thing I learned today is that OB will do anything to get out of  paying the $600, even play a baby rape a song for two little kids in the studio.  You sick F.  I didn't do it for the little kids.  I did it for our listeners.  And listen, one more thing I learned is that J-Mo is getting beat up by a fat guy Wednesday. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Take care.  Bye.  Vinny.  Yo, what's up, guys?  How's it going?  Yo, what's up?  I learned today, you are horrible, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, Anthony.  That was cold.  Hey.  Yeah, Anthony's a little out there.  Come on.  There was no need to do it, but on the other hand, it was kind of funny.  All right.  No way.  Thank you, Vinny.  All right.  Take it in the rear, guys.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:59:30]  Take it in the rear, guys.  Yeah, that's the take it in the rear, guys.  Hey, Frank, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  I learned today on the O&A show that you guys suck, and I will not listen to you again until tomorrow.  Thank you.  Peace out.  All right.  Bye.  Shout out to Jesse.  All right.  You just did.  All right.  Thank you.  Shout out.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Opie isn't going to hell, but he is from hell.  I'm from hell?  Yeah.  I didn't see anyone else, you know, jumping in trying to stop the train wreck that was happening. 
[03:00:00]  I couldn't do anything.  I'm on this side of the board.  Yeah, I know.  You're not supposed to do.  Can't do nothing.  But if a skank hoe is chasing you, and she's naked trying to read poetry, you didn't do anything.  You moved pretty damn quick.  You didn't do anything that time.  You didn't help me out.  What am I supposed to do?  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Bye.  Joe, what's up?  Hey.  How are you, Joe?  Wah-ha.  What's up? 
[03:00:30]  What did I learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Yeah.  Everything, because you guys are gods from two to seven.  You're my work of that.  And also, Jay Moore, I feel very bad for the unfortunate skinny bastard, because I think  that guy's going to sit on him.  Uh-huh.  And let's see what else.  So many things I learned from you guys.  I learned that pregnant chicks can't give birth in radio studios.  I don't know.  I drew a blank.  You guys put me on the air so quick, I'm like blanking out. 
[03:01:00]  That's right.  Ooh.  Nice one, huh?  How are you guys taking this?  I'm getting that shot.  I'm getting that shot down.  Yeah, we are, Joe.  Oh, I learned one more thing.  Yeah.  Diamond does pose Dallas.  All right.  Thank you.  Wow.  You know, remember the old rules?  We used to give up after the bad call?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Let's go, Dan.  Hey, I learned that Anthony's Jesus compared to Opie.  Yeah.  Hold the phone.  I got to agree with him now. 
[03:01:30]  Ant was talking about doing 15-year-olds the first break of the show today.  Did we all forget?  I did not.  Did I?  15 is a little bit different than two.  I didn't say I was doing two-year-olds.  It appears that you didn't want to.  No, it did not appear that way.  Did I say that?  Let's try to remember what Ant was doing in the beginning of the show today.  Why?  About fouling 15-year-olds and stuff.  No, I was talking about that singer.  The one that looks like Britney Spears and all the rest of them.  That happens to be 15.  So, thank you, Dan. 
[03:02:00]  Okay, see you.  All right.  That's her name.  Mandy Moore.  Alex, what's up?  Yeah.  I learned that Professor Stallone must have taken too many punches to the head.  Yeah.  That was pretty good today.  I'd like seeing him.  All right, Alex.  Thank you.  No problem.  Thank you.  No problem.  All right.  Let's go to Steve.  No problem.  All right, Steve, you're next on NAW.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned on the show today, Ant wants to do a 15-year-old.  There you go.  Oh. 
[03:02:30]  Come on.  Let's not forget.  All right.  Take it hard and heavy in the rear, guys.  You ass.  Okay, terrific.  The phones are just brutal.  Yeah, they are.  Absolutely brutal.  Let's just see what Anthony has.  Anthony, what's up?  Actually, it's Chris.  I know he put me through it.  I said my name was Anthony.  Oh, all right.  I learned that the Mets are going to lose the World Series and that Brittany is going  to be wearing a hockey helmet. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, yeah, well, okay.  And that Brittany needs a hockey helmet.  She had a light fall on her, Opie.  I didn't remember it.  Thank you, Anthony.  Jeez.  Peace out.  All right.  Holy smoke.  God damn, this is going nowhere.  This is so painful.  Oh, my God.  Maverick.  Punch out.  This is so painful.  Where's my Black Crow CD?  Why the hell did you guys get my Black Crow CD and Jay Moore?  We can use it right now.  Oh, my God. 
[03:03:30]  This is so painful.  Oh, my God.  Help us out.  I can't believe this.  We're in radio hell right now.  We've got to stall for five more minutes and we have nothing.  We have absolutely nothing.  We always play What Did We Learn Today on the show, and today it was just a disaster.  Yeah.  What is wrong with you people?  I don't know, but...  They're like on some kind of dope.  Vince, what's up?  Hey, I learned that Anthony's motto is old enough to bleed, old enough to butcher.  See, and they're not changing at all. 
[03:04:00]  Wait, I don't even get that one, Vince.  I know.  Did it have something to do with today's show?  Yeah, his little girls.  Let them bleed.  Butcher them.  Oh, my God.  What?  Or is it giving them the curb test?  Put them on the curb and if their feet touch the road, they're old enough.  Galambine stuff.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  Help us out.  What did you learn on the show today? 
[03:04:30]  What did I learn on the show today?  Yeah.  That Opie is the only person in New York City with a goddamn sense of humor.  All right.  I can accept that.  Anthony, you know you're just playing good cop.  You guys had this thing all set up.  I think it was beautiful, though.  Opie, keep it up.  You're the best.  Wow.  I finally got a compliment.  Yeah, you deserve a compliment.  It only took almost two years, but thanks.  Absolutely, Opie.  You ruled.  And syndication yesterday.  You guys suck.  Thanks, Joe.  Goodbye.  All right.  All right, Ant.  Maybe we can play some extra commercials or something. 
[03:05:00]  What is this?  Please come true.  With Rosie.  I can't play that again.  They already want to kill me.  All right, Ant.  Like, stall for a minute.  I'll find something.  Okay.  What a cutie patootie.  Okay.  Rosie and Scott.  Rosie.  Scott's doing an interview with Rosie.  All right, you guys. 
[03:05:30]  Virgin.  Rock on, little one.  Yeah, right.  Virgin.  Come on, give me a kiss.  Yeah.  Whoa!  Rock on.  What a mess.  Wow.  All right.  You know what that was like?  Hmm.  That was like, you know, you go to vacation, right?  And you're driving.  And you're driving home from vacation.  And you drove a real long time.  And you're getting a car wreck right outside your driveway.  We were almost there.  Yeah, because Chris from Jersey writes,  I learned that the show came to a complete screech and stop today.  But thank God it came to a complete stop at 6.40 instead of like 4.05. 
[03:06:00]  Right.  We hate ending this way, too.  Yeah.  Because then we have to think about it all night.  Like, oh, the last 20 minutes, it blew.  20 minutes?  No, it was like the last 10 minutes.  Yeah, it was just what did we learn.  Yeah.  That was it.  We might have to give up on the what did we learn segment of the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't know.  It might be.  We might have run out of steam on that little segment.  What did we learn today?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:06:30]  I mean, there's so many good ones to choose from today.  Sometimes they just don't pan out.  All right.  We still had fun today.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  This little kid is running around like crazy out there.  Why?  I don't know.  He's like...  Shut up the rosy doll.  I just threw it.  Opie is a...  Opie is Satan. 
[03:07:00]  There you go.  Okay, great.  All right, guys.  We've got to bail.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Punch out, Maverick.  We'll punch you now.  We'll leave you with our pal, Red Peters.  We'll leave you.  We haven't played him in a little while, Anthony, okay?  All right, Opie.  And we'll be back stronger than ever tomorrow.  Yes.  Starting at 2.  Yeah, man.  All right.  Thanks for listening.  It's NAW.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. </pre>
