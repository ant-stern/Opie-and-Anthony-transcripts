<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with an interview with actor Danny McBride, promoting his HBO show *Eastbound & Down*.  McBride discussed the show's premise, his experiences as a substitute teacher, and anecdotes from his past, including the low-budget production of *Foot Fist Way*. The conversation, peppered with crude humor and vulgar language, also covered his roles in *Pineapple Express* and *Tropic Thunder*, referencing specific scenes and co-stars like Will Ferrell and Nick Nolte.

Following McBride's departure, Paul O, a movie reviewer from *The Ron and Fez Show*, joined the studio to discuss his experimental film, *Gap*.  Clips were shown, highlighting its bizarre aspects, rapidly shifting aspect ratios, and inclusion of home movie footage.  Louis C.K.'s commentary on the film was mentioned.  The discussion included descriptions of the film's perceived flaws, its intentionally jarring style, and unusual production, all within a context of vulgar language and off-color humor.  The review continued with further discussion of *Gap*'s intentionally shoddy production quality, nudity, implied violence, and bizarre editing, with frequent interruptions to play back sections of the film.  Jimmy Norton also participated, contributing to the criticism alongside the hosts and Paul O, who defended the film's experimental nature.  Numerous instances of crude language, references to pornography, and sexually explicit content within the film were discussed.

Next, the show featured a recurring bit with Club Soda Kenny (Club Zodakini), who submitted a disco music demo to Sirius XM's "The Strobe" channel.  The hosts played and critiqued Kenny's demo, joking about the music and his persona, referencing Joe Causey, described as "the king of the strobe."  The segment included humorous, often vulgar commentary and sexual innuendo.  A backstage segment followed, featuring Primetime Sam Roberts and Geronimo, the program director of "The Strobe," who gave a scathing review of Kenny's demo, ultimately rejecting it. Kenny's subsequent decision to pursue country music was discussed.

This was followed by a conversation with Jim Norton about a recent visit to Anthony Cumia's large house, described as "Playboy Mansion-esque." Norton recounted a surprisingly uneventful evening, with Anthony passed out, an empty pantry, and a lack of a party atmosphere.  The conversation included descriptions of the house and Anthony's behavior, peppered with humorous anecdotes and comparisons to *The Shining*.  The conversation also touched on Anthony's home theater and the difficulties of hosting.

UFC President Dana White then appeared, discussing the new UFC video game, which the hosts played live on air.  Dana White provided commentary and answered listener questions about the UFC, covering various aspects of the game, the UFC's growth, upcoming fights, and the challenges of expanding into new territories.  White also discussed his frustration with negative media portrayals, specifically an ESPN E60 piece, and his use of the word "faggot" in a video blog response, the subsequent backlash from GLAAD, and his refusal to apologize to everyone except those he unintentionally offended within the LGBTQ+ community.

The show continued with a prolonged, bizarre, and often sexually suggestive "cotton ball bit" involving intern Jill's phobia of cotton balls.  The hosts, Dana White, and several unnamed individuals participated, engaging in various challenges to overcome Jill's fear, culminating in her blindfoldedly navigating a floor strewn with cotton balls. This involved audience participation and monetary incentives.

The broadcast concluded with a discussion about the Little People of America (LPA) convention and the controversy surrounding the term "midget." The hosts, along with caller Sam who attended the convention, discussed the LPA's objection to the term, comparing its offensiveness to that of the n-word.  They speculated on the etymology of "midget" and brainstormed alternative terms, generating many offensive and humorous suggestions.  Sam recounted his experience outside the convention, describing the atmosphere as surreal and the LPA's strict control over media access.  The hosts imagined scenarios to provoke attendees, and several callers contributed, including Charles, who vehemently equated the use of "midget" to the use of the n-word, and Frank, who reiterated the LPA's stance. The segment included numerous other callers contributing humorous tangents, discussions about imagined midget wrestling matches, inappropriate questions, and a brief mention of a child molester story. The segment ended with continued jokes and speculation about the LPA and their views.

[00:04:00]  It's, uh, E-Rock and Prime Time, Sam Roberts  Look at my picture with Juliette Lewis  I know, it's amazing  Sorry, what were you saying?  Um, I was just doing Worst of Stuff here  Oh, cool  Danny McBride's in studio  Danny McBride is one of the funniest goddamn people in anything  Kenny Powers  I've ever seen  Whether, I mean, but Kenny Powers is late to the party  If you want to talk about funny Danny McBride stuff  First of all, you spout it down  I don't mean to take that away from you, E-Rock  It's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen on HBO or any television station 
[00:04:30]  But then you talk about Foot Fist Way  You talk about the, he was the funniest part of Pineapple Express  Yes, he was  Did you see that movie?  Yes, I did  Hilarious  On a very ironic note, my mom loves Pineapple Express  You met my mom, right?  Yeah  Very strange  But she makes great coconut chicken fingers  They're sesame chicken  Oh, sesame chicken fingers  Whatever they were, they were delicious  But irregardless  Here is  You love your food, E-Rock  You just get distracted  Here's Danny McBride  Just killing it 
[00:05:00]  On the Worst of the Opie and Anthony Show  You're listening to the worst, worst of Opie and Anthony  Sorry about that  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show?  A lot of people excited that Danny McBride is on the show  I gotta read what Blaine in South Carolina just wrote  Danny McBride was hilarious in Hot Rod as Rico  He's funnier than Will Ferrell by far  Well  And Danny's not gonna comment on that because they're pals  But I don't know, I'm a big fan 
[00:05:30]  I appreciate it  And your latest project is called Eastbound and Down  I got a copy and I threw it in last night  And I loved it  What's the show about for the people out there that haven't heard yet?  Well, it's about a disgraced Major League pitcher  Who loses fastball  And he resorts to steroids  This kind of stuff never happens, of course  Major Leaguers using steroids  But he kind of finds himself down on his luck  And back in the town he grew up in  And he has no money, nowhere to turn 
[00:06:00]  And he's teaching gym  And living with his brother, who has a family  So, you know, the wife's like, what the F, dude  I think it really happens a lot  You get those failed athletes that just become the bitter gym teachers  Yeah, I'm sure  I knew the guy, Mr. Lilienthal, over at John Glenn  When I went to school there  And he had played  And you always hear, yeah, he played like one half a season  For the Denver Broncos  And then his leg blew out  And he had to teach gym  So now he just treats everybody like crap 
[00:06:30]  You know, Anthony's right  Because we had one at Oldfield's junior high school  And the rumor was that the gym teacher had a tryout  With the New Jersey Nets  And boy, did he take it out with us  Because he blew out his knee  So he never got the real shot at playing  For the New Jersey Nets  It's just enough exposure for him  To feel like he's better than everyone else  There's no more despicable person than the male gym teacher  It really is  Other than the female gym teacher  She likes her girls 
[00:07:00]  Anthony does a fine bit on the female gym teacher  Oh, where you get this one  Alright, girls  Today we're just going to take our clothes off  What's we're going to do?  Just take the clothes off  And teach how to shower today  Get out of the shower, girls  With that mullet haircut they got  Oh, I love it  You get older and you realize  Of course she was a lesbian  Yep  And she was teaching gym  With these young little, you know, barely legals 
[00:07:30]  And the gym teacher  Having the time of her life  Whenever they opened that accordion door  And the girls and guys could like see each other  The guy gym teacher would go over  And he's like chit-chatting with some 15-year-old girl  They're all despicable human beings  I love it  Well, that's pretty much what Eastbound and Down is about  For the most part  The montage of you losing your fastball was really funny  Because he was throwing it over 100 miles an hour  And then all of a sudden  You know, he's starting to get into some crap 
[00:08:00]  And now he's throwing it 95  But you're like, okay, you can still survive  In the big leagues with a 95-mile-an-hour fastball  Fast forward a little more  Now it's in the 80s  It's not looking good  And then all of a sudden he's out of baseball  And he has to move back to the small town  And live with his brother  What team were you supposed to play for?  Or could they not get Major League Baseball rights for a team?  No, I don't think the Major League  Was going to have anything to do with this show  But he played for Atlanta when he first started out  And then he goes to New York 
[00:08:30]  And he goes to San Francisco  And then Seattle  Do they just name the cities?  They don't name the teams?  We just named the cities  And then we just stole different fonts  From different teams  And used them on the different  So it would look familiar  But it's not  Right  It was very clever  They got around it  But what I thought was funny  Was that his career was ending  With a team like Seattle  Like everyone's like  You don't want to be in Seattle  But yeah, I loved it, man  I think it's going to do very, very well  It's very, very vulgar  My parents have been telling  All their friends at work about it 
[00:09:00]  And I'm kind of like  You guys should maybe tell them  It's on another network  You don't want them to see this  Why not, man?  I'd be proud of this one  It's clever, too  I mean, it's dark  And it's filthy  But it's also pretty clever  It's always the way, though  Because I'll be doing something  And some friend of my mom's  Will be like  Oh, yes, you're on the radio  What's the name?  And they pull out a pencil and paper  And go  What's the number of the station  To tune it?  And I just  You better not  Ooh, you better not listen 
[00:09:30]  I always give the raw frequency  Yeah  I really do  It's on a  It's on 93.2  I just mix it up a little bit  Yeah  Ooh, you got a show  On the home box office?  Yeah  Look for us on Cinema 100  Yeah  Or those old  Wemetka Home Theater  Telemundo  They give you a nice plug-in  The latest issue of Rolling Stone  And the one line  I gotta say it here  He's the kind of guy  Danny McBride  His character, anyway 
[00:10:00]  Who walks up to his fellow teachers  Eating lunch  And says  I don't mean to break up  A good time here  But I just saw two boys  Raping a sixth grader  That's comedy, right?  Well, then there's the shock  Of all the teachers  And you're like  Ah, just kidding  Yeah, that's comedy  Of course it is  It's not comedy  When you're reading it  Or when you see  You deliver the line  Yes, it's comedy, my friend  Just nasty to the kids  Bitter  He's very bitter  You know  Some of the inspiration  For it came  At one point 
[00:10:30]  And I moved back  To Virginia  Where I grew up  When things weren't  Really happening for me  In Los Angeles  And I was just trying  To write  I was living  At my parents' house  And I remember  The first day  I started substitute  Teaching there  To make cash  I introduce myself  To the kids  And I'm like  Yeah, I'm Mr. McBride  And I just start  Kind of justifying myself  Like, this is just  A stop for me  I'm not really  This isn't my real deal  Kids  Oh, no  It's that sort of arrogance  That kind of led  To the inspiration  Of this 
[00:11:00]  You did substitute teaching?  I did  I subbed everything  From like German  To math  I would just let  The kids watch cops  And just make sure  They didn't interrupt me  While I was chilling  Was there anything better  When you went to class  And the substitute teacher  Was at the front of the room  I know, you just knew  It was day off  It was day off  From that class  You didn't have to do anything  Every once in a while  You got one that was really  Trying to become a real teacher  But the rest of them  Were just kind of like you  Yeah, guys who had  Taken a detour in life  Yeah, just wanted  To get through it  Biden their time  Just sitting there  Hoping no kid 
[00:11:30]  Cracks his skull open  No lawsuits  Just get through the day  Yeah  It was always  It sucked when a sub  Used to give out homework  Yeah  That's not your responsibility  Yeah, he's taking it  Way too seriously  Yeah, stop it  Yeah, and I gave the kids  Homework when you were out  Just wanted you to know  I was going to pay attention  To you  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut  He writes  This guy, Danny McBride  You're going to know his name  I mean, dude  This is the last time  You're going to be on our show  We see this  We see this all the time 
[00:12:00]  And your part in this  Is to go  No, guys  You've been good to me  I'll be back  Yeah  No, you've been good to me  I'll be back  No  You'll be back  And about  No, God forbid  When, you know  The career starts  Going the other way  That's what happens  With us here  But Kevin writes  This guy stole  Pineapple Express  And I've got to tell you  I still haven't seen that movie  Because they won't put it  On demand  I don't know what that's about  I didn't see it in the theaters  And I can't get a copy  Of that movie  Do you know why?  It's on DVD  It, oh  Yeah, got to go out  Yeah, but I'm an 
[00:12:30]  On demand guy  Netflix it or something  Yeah, I've got to Netflix it  Because it's, you know  Has HBO been good to you?  HBO has been good to us  They let us do our own thing  Down there  Let us shoot in North Carolina  Where, you know  This thing is set  And that was  It was nice  Yeah, it's been a pretty fun ride  So far  Very cool  North Carolina  That's not usually a  Place where  Where people are dying  To go shoot  Yeah  Yeah  It doesn't sound like  One of those places  Where people are like  Yeah, we've got to get down there 
[00:13:00]  You would be surprised  We just wanted to use  Like real southern kids  We didn't want to have kids  From Van Nuys and Burbank  Putting southern accents on  Yeah  It's a lot of  A lot of local talent down there  Yeah  Also, they got the little  Southern accent thing going  Oh, yeah  Yeah  Plus, I think it's like  Pittsburgh where  It's probably cheaper  To shoot there  It definitely is  I imagine, you know  You can just buy the property  For what it costs to rent it  In L.A. or New York  Yeah, right  Exactly  How many episodes  You got to shoot?  We wanted to keep it small  Kind of like how the British model is  Of their TV shows  We kept it like six episodes  So we could just write  The whole thing 
[00:13:30]  And not have to hire  Writing staff  And not turn into  Some sort of formula  Wow, that's cool  Yeah, it's like  Each episode picks up  Where the last one left off  So it's kind of like  A three hour movie  In essence  Nice  Very good, yeah  And if you get season two  You put a few more hours together  There you go  We'll throw a few more hours in there  That's kind of smart, right?  Well, they usually  Yeah, that's what HBO usually does  It's usually like six episodes  And they say  You know, it's  It's a perfect amount  You see people are digging it  And you know  Yeah, and if people don't dig it  Then it's not on for too long  They can't make fun of you for too long  What's off? 
[00:14:00]  What's worse?  The only show got canceled  Which I love  Do you remember the comeback  With Lisa Kudrow?  Oh, great  How uncomfortable was that show?  Because the stupid critics  Of course probably didn't like it  I thought that was  A really funny show, man  Yeah, she was great  Yeah, yeah, yeah  There's a lot of  Deuce chill moments  Really good  Yeah, definitely  That's my contribution  Do you get  You get recognized  For Foot Fist Way?  I'm obsessed with that dumb movie  You know  Every once in a while  I do  You were a lot thinner in that  Yeah  You had to lose a lot of weight  To play the role, I guess  Of course, huh?  But yeah  You can always kind of judge 
[00:14:30]  People's movie taste  By what they recognize you from  You know  Right  You know  Foot Fist Way  People are really digging deep  If they're recognizing me from that  Your wife in that movie  What does she do for a real living?  Yeah  I don't think anything at this point  I think she's waiting for a big chance  That might have hurt  That might have hurt the movie a little bit  Is what I'm saying  Because you were great in it  She was pretty much  Reading her lines off  Cue cards or something  Her lines written on my forehead  Right  It was like a John Waters movie with her  Oh  I didn't see it  She took you out a little bit 
[00:15:00]  But Danny  Danny carried this  It's a really good film  And as far as  Every scene you're in  You just destroy  Destroy  What are you doing  You're working with  Because I've never done  I've never done more than  A couple lines in a scene  So I wouldn't know  I'm probably usually the problem  What are you doing  You're working with someone  And they just suck  I don't really know  I've been lucky enough  Besides this one instance  To not really work with  I love that he's not denying it  Most guys would be like  God come on man  She was out  That's funny  I gotta see that now  Dude  Foot Fistwear I think you would like 
[00:15:30]  Yeah  He's kind of like a  Master Poe type character  Ah gentleman  So  Yeah  I think you would appreciate it  Yeah  So wait  So this  She was a terrible  Was she an actress  Or no  Was she like a  She was a friend of ours  Which she probably won't be  After today  Oh  I'm sorry about that  Oops  It's just a friend  Doing a movie  It's nice to look at though  Yeah  She has some nice curves  Yeah  Did you make some promises  During the heat of something  I normally don't  I'm telling you 
[00:16:00]  I'm telling you  I gotta lead for you  I'm not really  Just be yourself  That was the audition process  Yes  Great  Sometimes that happens  You're gonna know  Yeah  And she  She performed  Yes  How'd you get into  The whole  Acting thing  It was by accident  It was honestly  Just through this  You know  Through Foot Fist Away  You know  Me and Jody  The guy who directed it  We went to film school together 
[00:16:30]  And kind of  Okay so film school  Film school  That kind of starts it  That's where it begins  A lot of people say  That's a big waste of time  Yeah  It wasn't in our case  No  Yeah okay  And yeah  We just made this movie  Went to Sundance  And you know  Didn't really have any aspirations  Of being an actor or anything  Just you know  Helped my buddy out  And yeah  And then next thing you know  I'm sitting here with you guys  Talking about  How  That's amazing  Yeah  Terrible my friend was  Sorry  How long were your friends with her for?  It was a long friendship  No 
[00:17:00]  It's fine  She'll be totally cool  Wow  I feel bad now  I really thought  You just like found somebody  You made the movie  While you were in film school?  No we didn't  It looks like we did  But  No we made it  After several years  Of kind of being in L.A.  And not really  Kind of getting what we wanted  To get going  We just went back  How'd you scrape up the cash?  Credit cards  Really?  Yeah  That does seem to be the way  These filmmakers initially do it  And just like  Come on  Yeah  Like rolling the dice  Come on  I mean it could have gone very bad 
[00:17:30]  Yeah  No crap man  Max out the credit cards  And hope for the best  That's exactly what Kevin Smith  Was talking about  With clerks  He you know  Just maxed out  Every credit card  He already had  Got the equipment  Put the movie together  And you know  Kind of lucked out  There's that kind of weird thing  Where you start spending the money  Like alright we're doing this  We're doing this  And then about  Halfway through the movie  You're like  Oh my god  We've done this  What is going to happen  If this doesn't do anything?  Were you  Were you  Like I've seen  I've seen a lot of  People's movies  That they put out 
[00:18:00]  And were you afraid  That it was going to be  Cheesy looking  And just  We knew we didn't have  A lot of money for that movie  I mean we had like  70 grand  And we didn't have  Any money to pay  A crew or anything  We just like  The film school we went to  We knew that you had  To have an internship credit  To graduate from there  So we went back  To the film school  And we're like  Hey anybody want to get  That internship credit  And come work for us  So you got some free guys  We got some full school kids  And holding booms  And things like that  Exactly  And you know  We were like  Let's not try to make this  Look like a big Hollywood movie  We obviously don't have  The money for that  So we just kind of 
[00:18:30]  Embraced the grittiness  And real large value  What did you film it on?  16  Super 16  16  We did rent the equipment  We rented the equipment  And yeah  Jesus  That was that  Do you know  Those projects normally  Like that's a  That's a great success story  Right yeah  For 70 grand  Normally the way they work  Is I had a part in one  Which apparently cost  The guy 60 grand  Which he recouped  11 dollars of  Oh Jesus  It was starring  Jim Florentine  And a comic from Jersey  Marty Fletcher 
[00:19:00]  And I was in  It was called  White Chicks Incorporated  Aha  That was the one  I told you  Where I play  Famous comedian  Jim  It's so bad  That's why  Because I've seen  So many bad  People's bad movies  And now with the  You know  Everybody  Can buy equipment  For so cheap  Yeah  And there's programs  And everything  So people  Everyone's a filmmaker  The bar is lowered  Definitely  Yeah  The bar has definitely  Been lowered  So to actually 
[00:19:30]  Put out a movie like that  And have it  Get as successful  As it did  Had it been  A big surprise  It definitely was  I mean we didn't  We really  A buddy of ours  Had done an independent film  And had gone around  On the festival circuit  So we were literally  Looking at that  Like well maybe we'll get  A few free trips  You know  Yeah  Yeah  To some cool countries  And take it there  And when did you realize  Like oh my god  People are taking notice  When it got into Sundance  We were pretty surprised  I mean we had worked  On the film  I guess for like  Three weeks  We had three weeks  To get the cut in  To Sundance  And we got in 
[00:20:00]  This like two hour  Version of the movie  Which was terrible  There was no sound mix  And we kind of were like  Well we tried  We'll come back next year  And we'll work harder on it  And so we stopped  Working on the film  We get this call  From Sundance  That it got in  And we're like  Oh man  Well how long do we have  To get this thing together  Before it shows  And so we had to just  Kind of hump it  And get it done  How much did it wind up making  I mean roughly  I'm going to show you  I don't know the exact  I think maybe  Like $16,000  I don't know  I don't think  It didn't do too great  In the box office  They you know  Paramount Vantage  Picked the film up  And their idea 
[00:20:30]  Was to hold on to the film  For like three years  And then release it  The weekend after  Indiana Jones comes out  Oh nice  Which is a perfect plan  Yeah sure  For a $70,000 movie  You know what  Well actually no  That's not a good plan  No literal Jim  You know what though  It's finding it's audiences  Put it this way  It really is  Did you sit there  And watch some of the people  Watching it there  And were you happy  With the reactions  It was getting  We were  You know  We were definitely  Happy with it  I mean it's not  You know  It's our sense of humor 
[00:21:00]  It's definitely  Not made for everyone  But yeah  I mean people who dig it  Then we dig them a little more  Because that is kind of cool  I can only imagine  Sitting there  And seeing what you put together  And having people  Actually appreciate it  And you know  Yeah it's a great feeling  And dig it and stuff  Definitely  And Will Ferrell got involved  Right  He did  Will and Adam saw the film  After Sundance  And yeah we didn't know  Those guys before that  And they just gave us a call  And said they liked the film  And wanted to kind of  Put it underneath their company  So  How cool is that  Everything just kind of  Took off from there  And now he's helping you out  Now he's helping me out 
[00:21:30]  I'm going to go see his show tonight  Looking forward to it  Should have brought him over here  Yeah  We like the guy  We can get him on the phone  Every once in a while  He's elusive  He pops up in Eastbound and down as well  Oh he does  He's a character  He appears in the next episode  Yeah we haven't mentioned it a lot  In the last 15 minutes  But Eastbound and down  Is Danny McBride's latest project  And I saw the premiere episode yesterday  It's great  And everyone else will be seeing it  Sunday at 10.30 on HBO  I highly recommend you check it out  And give it a chance  You know  I think that's it  I'm trying to think  What else  Oh uh  Tropic Thunder 
[00:22:00]  You were great in that too  Oh I appreciate it  I love you  I kind of want to see more of you  In the movie  Yeah  You know  Me and Nick Nolte  Were too busy having fun  On the island  Partying  That was  Yeah working with Nick Nolte  Must have been fun  It was incredible yeah  That was a great part  Because it was so  I don't know  It was a little inside  As far as the industry goes  But it made it that much funnier  To watch  Yeah  Because you know  The technical end of it  And you know  Getting mad at some of the  Things that were working 
[00:22:30]  And weren't working  And stuff  It's such an inside thing  If you've ever even  Lightly been on any kind of a set  You get that  That vibe yeah  That what goes on like that  But the Tom Cruise thing  Wow  Pretty wild wasn't it  I didn't know he had it in him man  Yeah  The dancing was his idea  When he did his camera test  He told Ben  He's like I want to dance  I want to dance in this movie  I think we asked you last time  You didn't even get to meet him right  I didn't get to meet him no  You were in the same film  I always think wow  You're in a film with Tom Cruise  You guys get to hang out  Yeah  No it doesn't work that way  But just how it's all put together 
[00:23:00]  You don't even see the guy  You mean they put it together different  Yeah  I thought they just  Filmed it all with everybody  Laughing together  Did you talk to Nick Nolte  You should have only talked about  Prince of Tides  That's all we talked about  And asked him  Like did he  I don't know where I'm going with that  I just keep thinking of him  Going oh Lowenstein  Crying  Crying in his stupid  Stupid  Artmark face  Barbra Streisand's chest  Oh Lowenstein  Oh we got it  You're sensitive  He won Sexiest Man Alive 
[00:23:30]  After that  In People Magazine  Wow  Because women like this  Because he's a rugged guy  Well of course  And he should have won it  After Q&A by the way  Oh god  When he was strangling transsexuals  That he had just had sex with  That's when he should have won  Sexiest Man Alive  I'm looking for Gans  One of my favorites  Him in 48 hours  Is fantastic  Gans  Let's get Brad on the air here  With Danny McBride  Brad Atlanta  What's up  Danny  You rock man  I just wanted to bring up  All the real girls  And how that's one of the best  Dramas ever  And you totally steal that movie

[00:25:00]  That's when you got to  Start answering a lot of questions  Yeah  And they watered down  Your crap right  They tried to  That too  So if you do it all yourself  I mean you're  Working like a dog  You got no one to answer to  At least it's fun  Well you know  You always look at something  Like the Pink Panther 2  It's kind of like  The benchmark  In comedy  That's what we get  All esteemed to  We've been killing  Steve Martin  For doing that movie  Killing him  I just keep thinking  Because people keep saying  You stole Tropic Thunder  And I keep thinking  Well funny  Let's talk about Steve  Stealing  Stealing a corpse

[00:28:00]  That Ford was in  What do I know  Ah whatever  Close enough  Yeah  What do you want from us  Isn't it history class  Yeah I don't know  I should have said Carter  Always Carter  It's a C word  It's funnier  It certainly is  Alright let's get Danny  Out of here  Hey thank you guys  For having me on  I appreciate it  Thanks Danny  Thanks  The very funny  Danny McBride  Hey this is Danny McBride  You're listening to  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  It's the worst  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:28:30]  And E-Rock  When we come back  Gap the movie  Never heard of it  Paul O  From the Ron and Fez show  Made it  Never heard of him  He does movie reviews  He worked on this movie  For a long time  Big Kev  No not Big Kev  And not Kent the movie guy  Either  I'm leaving that in  Well stay tuned  Because Paul O  Is coming up next  Here  Worst of Opie and Anthony  It's E-Rock and Sam  Sam  Paul O  Legend from the Ron and Fez show  Is in studio  He's got a movie 
[00:29:00]  Of course he  Well I don't know  If you'd call it a movie  It's motion picture  I guess  So uh  It's a horror movie  It's called Gap  And I watched it  As part of my show homework  Yes  And it was unwatchable  One of the worst movies  I've ever seen in my life  Really  Yes  Hmm  Well you're gonna have to  Suffer through it now  Because Paul O's in studio  And we're playing clips  Of crap  Well it's Gap  And thank god  Louis C.K. was there with us  Yes  To rate this movie  As he saw fit 
[00:29:30]  Here on the worst of Opie and Anthony  You're listening to the worst  It sucks a pile of cock  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Oh shit  Speaking of movies  We got Paul O out there  Oh that's right  That's when he did a movie  He's a Ron Fez guy though  He is a Ron Fez guy  Are we acknowledging  That it's a Ron Fez guy  Yeah yeah yeah  Obviously  How did this come about  Well because he has  A motion picture  But wouldn't he just  Go on Ron Fez  And promote his motion picture  I believe he is  Doing that too  But I  See I went on to  Ron Fez 
[00:30:00]  Yeah  And I started talking  About Paulo  And his  His film  Yeah  And I had  You know  I guess a review  Of it  Did you see the film  Some of it  I've not seen it  I saw some of it  Okay  I heard it's good  And  You did  Yeah I heard it's actually  Really good  And so  It got to the point  Where you know  We had  Seen it  Sam has seen it 
[00:30:30]  I believe  Some of it  Sam you like the movie  Sam you saw it  Let's see what Sam  Thinks of this movie  Louie's a filmmaker  He could appreciate  A good film  Sam  I was able to see  The whole film  Last night  It was  Terrifying  It's a horror movie  Oh terrifying  Terrifying  Gotcha  Terrifying  Fying  Gotcha  Yes  It was  Long at parts  But  Long in parts  Yeah  One part would be  Longer than another part  It was  The first hour  Was a lot longer 
[00:31:00]  Than the second  Ten minutes  I assumed  That it was  Going to be  One of those  So bad  That it's good  Movies  Especially since  Most of the cast  I know  Oh really  You've seen them  Walking around  These very hallways  And you know  That must be amazing  You just know them  Not as actors  But as just  Interns and people  And fucking  Friends of the show  And fat little  English people  That sell  Fucking t-shirts 
[00:31:30]  With tiny heads  Little heads  And no brains  Stalkers  Yeah  Stalkers  So I figured  Yeah at least  I'm in on that  It'll kind of be funny  It didn't catch me like that  He's right there  Listen  Yeah  I  I  Didn't  Get it  I didn't get the point  Oh boy  You may want to  I  I didn't  I thought it was  Horrible  Well should we 
[00:32:00]  Dude I don't  Can we ask him  Questions  Polo  Sure  Come on in  Polo  This is  Polo  Come on in there  Polo  The writer  Director  Star of  The Orson Welles  Of Gap  Yes  Gap  Of Gap  The movie's called  Gap  Wait I want to start  By saying Polo  Now it's been  Obviously many years  They replaced the G  With a C-R  And you might have  A movie  Paul  It's a spelling joke  Yeah we like  It's been many years  It's been many years  Gap  Oh crap 
[00:32:30]  Just to bring everyone  Up to speed  The last time you were  On our show  What was it  Was it the Sandy Cain  Kissing of the  Twato  Yeah what happened  Is over the years  We've had encounters  With the Sucky Bed event  And then of course  The Enema show  Right the Enema  The Enema show  Various things over the years  But I've always respected  The fourth wall  The imaginary fourth wall  Between Ron and Fez  And Hopi and Anthony  I just figured there was one  I don't know if there is one  Or not  I don't think that's a good use  The tween shall never meet  I don't think  I think it's a terrible use 
[00:33:00]  Of fourth one  Well it's maybe the mind thing  That I'm thinking  No that doesn't  Is that like  You mean  Fourth wall is where  You're watching the thing  And you imagine  There's three walls  To the show  And the fourth wall  Is the audience  Is torn down  So some sort of  You know  Some sort of a barrier  Between Ron and Fez  And this show  Would not be any kind  Of a fourth wall  No  That would be one wall  It would be a fourth mistake  Unless they were the audience  No  Ron and Fez were the audience  The fourth wall  Would be Ron and Fez  It could be the fourth wall  In any case 
[00:33:30]  I've been with  You saw a separate  Kind of thing  I thought I should  Honor something  I don't know what  I would call it  Well you know what it was  That's what  Well we wouldn't  We wouldn't have you on  To do  You know  Let's have Paulo  Do movie reviews  Or things like that  Because that's  You're Ron and Fez guy  Right  But since you put out  Yeah and there's a  Fourth wall  Between the two shows  And there's a fourth wall  And there's no door  That's what I think  So you gotta go through  The ductwork  Maybe it's just a bay window  Or something  That's what I'm thinking  So but in any case  I was doing Ron and Fez  Since the 90s  As a movie reviewer 
[00:34:00]  Yeah  And so people expect me  To know movies in and out  And then they have an expectation  That this should be like  Citizen Kane  Gap  Well no  Why would they expect that  As a movie reviewer  Why would anyone expect  A movie reviewer  To make anything that  Is like Citizen Kane  Well I think they would expect  That I would have  A full knowledge of movies  And a full understanding  Of what a movie should be  Oh  Not really  No  Well how long  Would it take you  To make the movie  Okay first of all  This was an experimental movie  And it took three days 
[00:34:30]  To make  Experimental movie  Three days  Three days  Louie's a filmmaker  Three days  What do you think of a movie  That only took three days  A tenth of the amount  Of time it usually takes  And how long is the movie  It's an hour and 23 minutes  So it's not like  It's a short  Like a five minute short  That you throw together  No  We cut it down  For three hours  What  So there's three hours  Shot an hour a day  And then edited it out  Half of it  They edited it out Tuesday  Is there a director's cut  That's going to ever be available  Well here's the problem 
[00:35:00]  There's actually  Before we start  Promoting this movie  I have to honor  The Ron and Fez  Opie and Anthony community  So because  Essentially this movie  Should only be released  With no knowledge  Of what this is  So we put out  The director's cut  Collector's edition  Well don't worry  If you see it  You won't know  What it is either  And then we're going to  Put out the basic edition  Do you want to market this  To the movie theaters  No I don't think we can  Because I have no money  But you know  Is it good  This is just something  He burns you a copy  On his map  And he writes you 
[00:35:30]  The name of it in sharpie  On the actual disc  So I've been  I've been listening  To the gap  Explanation for  How many years now  A year and a half  Something like that  I still have no  Effing idea  What this movie's about  I saw it  Or most of it anyway  And I have no idea  What it's about  All I see  Scene after scene  Is  Polo  With some type  Of a knife  Some victim  Poorly tied up  In the background 
[00:36:00]  Very loose  Very loosely tied up  In the background  Trying not to laugh  As they're squirming  And not really  Trying  Or the fear  Isn't really  Getting there  And then  A bloodless  Murder scene  For a horror movie  Wait Anthony  Maybe he didn't  Tie them up tightly  Because the fear  Or the intimidation  Of who he was  Was keeping them there  And that's part of  The mistake  Or maybe he didn't 
[00:36:30]  Tie them tightly  Because it made them  Uncomfortable  They weren't actors  They were just  Friends of his  Well the fear  Fear and intimidation  Would have been  A good thing  To keep the viewer there  Because it didn't  Work for me  Alright first of all  To defend the movie  I honestly believe  That you know  There has been  It's a specific  Type of movie  That you haven't  Seed before  And it kind of  Taps into that audience  Hopefully down the road  Once I finish  Marketing to my  Core audience  Which is of course  Ron Fez  Opie and Anthony  I want it to be  Four people  You don't have to  Put Opie and Anthony 
[00:37:00]  In there  No problem  Ron and Fez  And pedophile  That's your audience  Pedophile  Fucking wife stealers  You know  The Blair Witch Project  Is obviously  A lot of shaky  Canva things  Oh right  Okay okay  So you kind of  Were going for  Some kind of a  This is not  Professional  Exactly  A professional shot  It's supposed to be  Some lunatic  Setting up a tripod  With a camera  Before he kills people  Right  The scene  With no filter Paul  Yes  Who's a genius 
[00:37:30]  He genius  Does great work  Genius  Using that word again  I want to see that  He  That scene goes on  And on  And on  To  It's maddening  And I don't mean  In a good way  It's not like  I was saying  I don't mean  Like watching this  And going  Holy shit  This is great  I was like  Holy shit  They're still  Fucking doing this  I left  Usually when I'm  Watching a movie  I haven't seen before  And I have to go  Take a piss  Grab a beer  Whatever  I pause it  Sure  I didn't pause this  I just went 
[00:38:00]  I took a piss  I grabbed a beer  I washed my car  Whatever  I come back  Fucking no filter Paul  Is still in the chair  Loosely tied  With no shirt on  Everybody's in their underwear  That's true  Yeah everyone's in their underwear  And there's some nudity as well  Because you know  They say the foreign markets  You need the nudity  Foreign markets  What are you looking for  Foreign  Jersey  We're talking  It's Japanese  I need  Japanese  The Japanese  The Japs  Please  Just change the G 
[00:38:30]  To a J then  I think it's about them  Oh he goes  Oh  Fourth wall  He went over  Fourth wall  Fourth wall  No you can never  Go over fourth wall  Between the Roy Fizzy  Or the Anthony  There's a fourth wall  I love the gap  Are you familiar  With a movie  Called Peeping Tom  Yes of course  Oh  Well Louis might be  On to something  Louis thinks that  Your movie sounds  Very much like  Peeping Tom  It's the same movie  It is  It's the same movie  It's a famous British director  Who did a lot of 
[00:39:00]  Who fucked a wife  Of some guy  And shipped her over  That's right  Oh  He was in prison  He did a famous  Ballet movie  Called The Red Shoes  But he did the  Pretty big time  Real famous  Oh  No clue  I also just  I want to  I want to touch on something  The way it was  Shot and edited  Yes  Do you  Do you or the editor  Or anybody  Who was in charge  Of the aspect ratio  Of the movie  Alright  There were  The whole point  Is to be as experimental  As possible 
[00:39:30]  Right  I understand  So you change  Aspect ratios  I understand  So it would go  From widescreen  Experimental film  The idea is  That you have an idea  That you're burning  To do as a filmmaker  Nobody's really  Done it before  But you're willing  To try it as an experiment  To see if it'll work  The thing isn't to go  I want to make  An experimental movie  So what kinds of things  Are experimental  Yeah  You're supposed to start  With an idea  Of a movie  That this is a movie  I really want to make  I think this would be cool  And even though  It hasn't been done  I'm willing to do 
[00:40:00]  The experiment  You're starting with  I want to do something weird  Yeah  Yeah  How about changing  The aspect ratio  That will hurt people's eyes  That will just  Like the thing is  I'm thinking  If you were going to go  Widescreen  Right  Then you shoot  The whole thing  Widescreen  And then  In editing  You make it look like  The regular  Old style TV  What ratio is that  3-4  Yeah  Something like  Going that  That gets it to fractions  Right  What?  It gets it to fractions  Well whatever it is 
[00:40:30]  You could have laid  The whole thing out  So that my television  Wouldn't snap  Back and forth  It was stretching  And snapping  Like your TV knows  Your TV  Your DVD players  These days  It feels the black  Sides of the image  Everyone knows  When to do certain things  To certain aspect ratios  So if you would have just  Kept it all widescreen  And then made it look  It wouldn't have been  It was so distracting  Every time it switched  My TV went  Click click  And then numbers came up  On the side  A code  The fucking stretch 
[00:41:00]  It said wide  It went  Like my TV was freaking out  My TV hated your movie  It's  Your  It's  The movie is actually  Supposed to generate hate  In every possible way  It's supposed to  Force people  Confront people  Push people to the edge  In a lot of ways  In a different way  I think was the intent  It forces people  To turn off their TV  Well I figured every way  I could do  Of course  It forces people  To rent Peeping Tom  Which was the  One you stole it from  Which is better  I didn't steal  Which was better 
[00:41:30]  We all steal  See what you're saying  I didn't steal  Well we all steal  You and the thieves  All steal  Hey Paul  What I'm saying  Is there's a difference  Between let's see  You're watching a movie  About a bank robbery  And you're like  Immersed in it  And going  Holy shit  I'm afraid  I'm concerned  For these characters  There's a bank robbery  Going on  And then  Actually being involved  In a bank robbery  Right  You're gonna feel  An emotion  Right  Like you said  To bring out hatred  It's supposed to 
[00:42:00]  But it's the wrong thing  In the movie version  It's great  If you could bring that out  The physical act  Of watching it  Made me hate you  Okay well  First of all  Not the movie  It's essentially  An anti-film  It goes against  All the film jargon  And the film logistics  That you're used to  So you see  In a way  The groaning you're hearing  Is Louis C.K.  A filmmaker  A filmmaker  No we should do  What you're saying  Shut it James 
[00:42:30]  I do  No we should do  Because Louis is here  Jimmy is an insufferable prick  Can we get the first  No he does  Can we get the first scene  Of the movie  And we can watch it  Because I've never seen  Get the first scene  Up there  Would you mind  If we broadcast  The first scene  Of this movie  You really want to  Go to the  Can I say something  Hold on  Louis here  And Louis is a  Brilliant filmmaker  Yes  But  He's a brilliant guy  But  But  Fantastic  You're a genius  You're hilarious  That maybe you pushed 
[00:43:00]  That he didn't think of  And it's almost like  He's trying to cut off  Your legs  Because what if  Your idea  Is all of a sudden  I am burning  But let me just say  To Louis CK  It's killing me  Let me just say  To Louis CK  I went the wrong way  With my career  As I say  Yes  This is intended for  First of all  This has been  Developed on air  For a year and a half  So everybody's aware of it  Not by anyone's choice  By the way  I understand that  That's understandable  But here  It's really supposed 
[00:43:30]  To leap out  Of like the shadows  And you don't know  What the fuck this is  Makes you want to leap  From a ladder  And so you know  When you find it  And have no knowledge  Like your ex there  Then you'll be real  I  Say what the fuck is this  Paulo I can understand  I can  I understand what you're  Saying about it  But it's  I understand  The aspect ratio  Is a problem  And I did have  A camera problem  Because I had  Two different cameramen  So there was a problem  Well two different cameramen  Holy shit  Desi Arnaz  Now you're getting 
[00:44:00]  A little crazy  Listen we gotta take a break  We got Paulo  He's promoting  I guess gap  Are you doing  Something crazy  On Ron and Fez today  I'm always  You said something  About your last stunt  Yeah  And we sent out  A crazy  It's your suicide  Life coach guy  Sent out a crazy memo  To you guys  That I was gonna be  What does the title mean  The gap  Oh it's actually  Here's the message  The divisions in society  The generation gap  Was the core issue  Right  But I mean  We're always  We're always divided  From each other 
[00:44:30]  On every level  What does that have to do  With some guy  In his underwear  Killing another guy  In his underwear  He's torturing people  Sacrificing people  So we will love  Each other more  So we'll learn  It's like a lesson  So you'll love  Each other more  Boo  I think you guys  Are prejudging it  I mean  It's honestly  I have one  Social message  After the break  Maybe I was too stoned  When I watched it  Maybe  I don't know  After the break  After the break  We'll do the opening scene  Because you've got a  Filmmaker in studio 
[00:45:00]  And you'll get an  Honest review  Okay  Thank you  I want to see  Some of this film  Of course  Also you've got to  Show off your  Horrendous tattoos  Sometime today  Sometime today  I mean  I'm going to stay there  Nice  It's the worst  It's the worst  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Continuing on  With the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Now we have an interview  That we did with Paulo  Yes  That we will play  After this segment here  So you better stay tuned  Because that's a reason  For you to keep listening  Yes  Well this is part two  Of  Crap  Gap 
[00:45:30]  Is the name of the movie  But yes  No Ron told me  It's called crap  Ron sometimes plays  Tricks on you  Because you have  A weak mind  I'm so gullible  I know you are  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony  Show  Wow boy  We're lucky  Paulo in studio  Oh yeah  Promoting Gap  On our show  Yep  I don't know what we did  To Ron and Fez  To deserve this  Well it's the  The fourth wall  Payback's going to be a bitch  Huh  The fourth wall  Is finally broken  The fourth wall  He's still going with Louie  That is the incorrect  Use of the fourth wall  I'm fucking wrong  I'm sorry  I was corrected  Thank you 
[00:46:00]  Louis C.K.  Louie already explained  That that just doesn't work  Yeah  Themovie.com  And I even got a promotional  Called Ron Fez  If you go there  He'll send you the film baby  I need to sell him  Some people are saying  That they send money  You don't send the movie  Oh that was  That's great  That's great service  That's a great service  You send money  We don't send the movie  Comment  That is actually  The proper thing  It's the easiest transaction  You'll ever take part in  There's some accusations  Out there Paul  You're not sending out  The movie  Because that's what people  Do on those message boards  They bust balls  Why would anybody  Take the time  To make a complaint 
[00:46:30]  That's totally  Unbased  Of course  Obviously you have been  Slow on the shipping  This is for you Lou  We're going to look at  The first scene  Of Gap  That word is there  The first word was there  The second word is  This is the playful font choice  Playful font  Play school font  Play school  Yeah it is  Wait where's our audio  And then he changes  There is rock music  That's actually the  Wait we need the rock music  He writes Gap twice 
[00:47:00]  And that's the shaky  Friends opening  Yeah the friends opening  Font  Friends opening font  The music style  These are all default choices  On Final Cut Pro  I'm a monster  Oh this is the movie  Yeah  Oh fuck  I'm a monster  Now  And that's me  As a long toe headed child  Now I'm a monster  War  Life is a war  We hate each other  It's hopeless 
[00:47:30]  It'll never get any better  I wish I could do something  About it  So I am  This is an art film  I want to do something  That matters  Watching your movie  Have an impact  For fuck's sake  Stop  We're in a theater  I'd agree  I get it  I get it  Dave  Did somebody change the channel  Or is this still the movie  It's still the movie  That's my late one  That's the dead life  That doesn't make me  Necessarily a nice person  But it just means 
[00:48:00]  You don't have to give back  What they did to you  Unfortunately  The life they chose  And it does lead to that  It's hard to make a choice  Make a choice about what?  Well she made her  Hit stop  You couldn't wait  For the truck  To fucking pass by  I wish there was a way  There's a truck  In the fucking  Let's take that again  This is a video  No  No that's not  That's not an  Amtized  Have you examined it? 
[00:48:30]  Yes I have  And I don't find  Any true evil in myself  I find a lot  Of horrible mistakes  I think you need  To take it closer  Um  Is this a toll booth  On the Jersey turnpike  No  I've had a lot  Of horrible mistakes  But they were never evil  I think you need to take it  She's good  Well if that's what she's saying  But I don't have  An Audrey Hepburn  I'm not doing this  To save anybody too  She was good before  She fell off a ladder  With a shoulder infection  And she wears lots 
[00:49:00]  Of wacky clothes  Over the years  If it would save your soul  Would you sacrifice your life  To save my soul  And my body  Your soul  Would you die  Yes  Okay  I would  Alright  That's all  Okay  She should have filmed  Her suicide  This is the person  I lived with forever  And lived through tragedy  After tragedy with  In what seemed like forever  But it had to end  Cops in traffic court  Read the record  Read into the record  Better than that  With her crazy hat 
[00:49:30]  A cop reading into the record  What he saw you do  On the highway  When you were speeding  Reads better than that  He couldn't  Get germs  Save from Jones  Wait wait wait  She found the right  Balance of medication  Alright hold on  Hold on  Hold on  We gotta pause this  Alright okay  Oh you got to pause  I wanna know  Why  If this is some kind  Of a video  Diary  Of some  Fictitious  Thing  Why did you put  Realism in there 
[00:50:00]  Like you talk  About her  It's really her  She really did do that  She's dead now  And you  You recite  It's not part of a movie  It's like the fucking  Director  Having his little  Home movie  And a little comment  At the beginning  Of a movie  They always say  That you write  What you  Know  You didn't write  What you know  You put down  It's a documentary  It's a home movie  It's a home movie  Also she talks  Like she talks  Like he does  Everybody in the movie  Is just this rambling  Never 
[00:50:30]  Sentences that literally  Don't begin  It's a  Some people have  Sentences that don't end  He has sentences  That don't begin  They just come in  In the middle  Just in one moment  You're not listening to him  The other moment  You are  You go  How did I get  Where am I  Where am I  It's a quasi  Pseudo documentary  Quasi pseudo  Yeah it is  Throwing a few words  Together  Makes it a little better  Quasi pseudo documentary  Okay now I'm looking  At you and you're  Screaming  Yeah it's obviously  Something's going on  Oh yeah now  Something  Okay this  You're yelling  Okay 
[00:51:00]  I'm always trying  To clarify my thoughts  Make sure I'm right  Are you  Make sure I'm not  Making mistakes  I mean  There are so many gaps  Gaps  I see  Now look at this  In the content  I want to start using  Music in this presentation  We're not going to  Because music is so dead  So arrogant  Just tasteful  Contemptuous  With no heart  No wonder the record industry  Is being destroyed  If they even call it  The record industry anymore  It's not something 
[00:51:30]  Like that  Commentary  Can you stop  For a second  So what's happening  There is he's going  To start putting  Some score  Some music  So he tells the audience  I'm going to play  Some music now  During this movie  It might be like  You're watching Jaws  And you hear  Hey here comes a shark  Listen to this piece of music  That makes it sound scary  Do these go together  Well to you folks  Write me a letter  And let me know  Why did you do that  Because exactly  He is commenting 
[00:52:00]  On the fact  That he's putting in music  That he hates  You know  This modern  You know  Record industry  Give me a break  So he's commenting  On the destruction  Of society  God record industry  Why do they call it  That anymore  They don't  You're the only one  Calling it that  He's the guy  Who's obsessed  With the generation  Is he  Oh it's a character  I'm sorry  It's a character  It's a character  Exactly  And he's obsessed  With the records  Records don't exist anymore  I know  It's crazy  It's just insane  Right 
[00:52:30]  It's just  Yeah  Wow  I keep playing it  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  Can't hear you  Can't hear you  Can you understand  What I'm saying  That requires  That requires repeated  Viewings  You see this is the film  Yeah  It requires repeated 
[00:53:00]  Throwing into the garbage  And never watching  Who wants  And the deeper you get in  It requires repeated  Attention to the sound mix  Let's hear that again  Make sure we can hear  What he's saying  Because otherwise  Why say anything  If you're not going to  Turn it up  Oh my god  Go Paul  For that first time  You listen to  You say  I've got to see  I didn't hear  I've got to hear  No  You're just saying  Why the fuck  Can't I hear  What he's saying  Paul 
[00:53:30]  I think so far  You're doing well  With the review  With Louis C.K  He's  So far  It's really good  I think  After I'm dead  This will become  A huge thing  Yeah  Hopefully tomorrow  It kicks off  The artist  Because I'm going to  Murder you  And they're going to  Find out it's because  Of this piece of shit  Let's go back  We're almost done  It's going to be  Exhibit A  It's important  And that's  Neither can I  If you're not  Blind  I wish I was blind  Right now 
[00:54:00]  Some of the nudity  Coming right up  Oh wow  Force abduction  Of people  I hope it's not you  A couple who  Appeared to  Meet up  Typical  Typical couplings  In the night  I mean  Pointlessness  Of  Yeah pointlessness  Common sexual behavior  Of modern society  Human species  Why is she laughing  In the background  She's not laughing  Why isn't she  Screaming  She's scared  She's crying  She's crying  You know  There's a naked girl  On the couch  In the background  She's frightened 
[00:54:30]  How did she not  Really think  You were going to  Kill her  Like you're  That nuts  I would think  You were making  A snuff film  Is that supposed to be  A blood stain  On the back wall there  See that's the kind  Of little details  In the review  Yeah little details  Oh my god  You're right  Is that supposed to be  A blood stain  Yeah no exactly  You're supposed to be  Thinking  Is that a blood stain  You're not supposed to be  Going  Did that idiot 
[00:55:00]  Really think  That I was going to  Think that's a blood stain  Did they think  For a second  That I was going to  Buy that  Fucking red paint  What did you do  You know  Jesus  It looks like  It was done  With like a  Thin brush  That's kind of  Thematic reinforcement  In a way  No it's not  It's subliminal  It's just a mistake  On your part  To have done  Such a shoddy job  There's nothing  Subliminal about it  It couldn't be  More obvious  It's  It's in fact  Yeah 
[00:55:30]  Oh my god  You don't want to  Be very obvious  You just wanted to  Kind of put it there  And let people  Think about it  It's like subliminal  Right  It's something  Not subliminal  But like  Do we at least  Get to see  This girl's tits  Yes  Who is the girl  She's actually very good  I don't care  You can tell  She's naked  She's actually very good  It's my brother-in-law's  Ex-wife  Okay good  Good good  Alright let's go  My ex  We got it  Your brother-in-law's  Ex-wife  And making it  As a  You mean your sister  To make it understood 
[00:56:00]  That  All right  You're holding some  Weapon race  Weapon  Yeah thank you  Shears  And a knife  And there's also  Some long metal  All right  There's  Let me just point  Something out  There's a girl  A naked girl  Over on the bed  With a look on her face  Like come over  Anytime guys  Instead we're listening  To a fat guy  In an orange shirt  With a horrendous mustache  Say things that mean  Nothing  Exactly  This is good camera work  And there's a light 
[00:56:30]  Behind him  Which is the most  Annoying thing in the world  No the light is  From the camera  It doesn't matter  What's  It doesn't matter  What the source  Of the light is  It's behind your  Stupid fucking head  You can see the camera man  And you're fucking  Painting on the wall  It is really  Fuck up  Is that the light  From the camera  In a reflection  Yeah  Take that picture down  If you remember  Clockwork Arts  Yes  There was a lot  Of that kind of stuff  Well this is just like  How dare you  It's one of the most  Carefully made  Beautiful films ever 
[00:57:00]  Fucking Cobra  Deliberately look like  A porno  How dare you  It is  This doesn't  A porno director  You wouldn't get hired  As a porno director  I swear  If you gave this  To a fucking  Porn company  They'd go  Fuck you  I swear  They wouldn't hire you  To swab the cum  Off the floor  Cobra said  He wanted  Clockwork Arts  To look like  They wouldn't let you  Fluff the biggest  The ugliest fag  On the set  It's that your instincts  Are so poor  That we don't even 
[00:57:30]  Want you around here  You're going to  Fuck something up  We're talking about  The camera work  Oh  There's a little  Fluff  Oh good god  Louie  Go ahead  Alright  That was intentional  It was absolutely  We want to see  The naked chick  At least  It's going to be  A zoom  So far  She's really trying  To get out of those  Ties  She's frightened  I'm a big guy  She kind of looks  Hossa  She looks very hot  She reminded me  Of Angel  Angel Tompkins  She doesn't remind me  Of anybody  Because I can't see her  Because I'm looking at you  If you remember  Angel Tompkins 
[00:58:00]  Was a gorgeous actress  In the 70s  Right  Good reference  Thank you  But soon my rambling  Will be over  And we'll do the zoom  The rambling is good enough  Because it shows  The state of mind  Thank you  He's getting up  He's getting up  With the shears  Do the sacrifice  For the benefit  Of the viewers  For the benefit  Of the viewers  Who's  Oh your turn  I'm telling them  That I'm doing this  Yes  Oh man  She's scared  She's acting 
[00:58:30]  Dude what the fuck  Is she doing there  How'd you get a hot girl  Oh no  She's acting  It's a disaster  Oh no  Oh no  She was frightened though  Oh turn up that music again  There's a nipple  What are you  Are you cutting  Oh god  Oh god  Oh  Really  The back of your leg  Oh now  Now's the naked guy  What the fuck  Alright  We can talk about this 
[00:59:00]  Hold on  Let's pause  He killed her  Okay  Let's go to Louie  Louie's moaning  Over there  He's moaning  Wait  Louie had a problem  With the murder scene  Paul  Yeah  At the back of his leg  We're hearing you going  And we had a very good opportunity  To see a nice set of tits  And you  Yeah  Wouldn't even give us that  In this crappy movie  And you don't even throw  Like a  Just a little jar of blood  In the shot or something  Yeah  Why was there  That a bloodless  Would you use all the paint  On the wall  There was no more red paint  Sorry 
[00:59:30]  There was a lot of blood later  We brought in a guy  Who was actually good  In a lot of  Brought in a guy  Brought in a guy  Benjamin Moore  And we used a lot  Of the old school  You know  Where we  You must have cut all that out  It was late  Because I just saw the back  Of your leg  And heard you  Yeah  Where's the murder  In fact that wasn't horrifying  It's implied  Was she dead  Implying  At the end of that  Because her tits  Was still moving up and down  Like she was still breathing  I thought you said  It's a slasher movie  People don't die right away  They even did 
[01:00:00]  When people were guillotined  They even did a study  Back in the old days  About how long  The heads would respond  Can we try that now  Sometimes ten seconds  Who did the study  Who funded it  Guys who were interested  In guillotines  Yeah you know what  You're right  That's the best murder scene  I ever saw  You just talked me into  Enjoying it  I'm winning him over  You just debated it  Into a good scene  Holy shit  Instead of actually  Shooting anything  That matters  And I think with repeat viewing  I mean Jesus Christ  Enough with repeat viewing 
[01:00:30]  Especially in this day  Yeah repeat viewing  No one has time  For repeat viewing  Repeat viewing  Come on  Let's get to  This murder out of the way  Yes let's keep going  Sure  Experience at this point  And that  The idea of  Now here  I had  Him  Who I  I always feel the male  Is the guiltier of the species  The more vile  The more evil  The real predator  The real  Source of all  That is wrong with society  Did somebody off camera  Just cough  Yeah  I did hear that  Can you please roll it back  You really did hear that 
[01:01:00]  And again  We need to sacrifice  Nobody's respecting the set  Like they're sitting  They're walking  You can hear them walking around  There was a cough  In the studio here  That is wrong with society  If somehow women  Could take control  And take over  And it might be  There is somebody  Caught  Or sneezed  I thought it would have been him  He's choking in the background  That wasn't him  All right  Oh there's a boring knife again 
[01:01:30]  Would you just  Would you just use the cam mic  The ass or whatever  We'll see  No it was a good  For what  The most  For what  Oh he's acting  Oh he's acting  It's really not personal  It's just that  It's just to  This film will hopefully be seen by everyone  No it won't  Everybody have a shitty day  Everybody have a shitty day  I'm having a shitty day right now  You don't even know her name  No  I wish I was him  Really living that moment  I'd rather be that guy  Really tied up on a couch 
[01:02:00]  Getting shears in you  Yeah  Than watch it happen  That was convincing  Let me go  Let me go  I don't know her name  I don't know your name  Yeah you don't know her name  You don't know my name  I'll get somebody  I can meet another guy  Was there a script  It's really not about  The way this was done  It's a yes or no question  It's a yes or no question  It's a yes or no question  That's right  Was there a script  Well I bought a computer  No  I got final draft 
[01:02:30]  Which is a script writing program  I bought some paper  With three holes in the sides  And some brats  I then proceeded to write  To write some  So there wasn't a script  We had extensive interviews  Sure you did  With everyone involved in the film  So there would be a common ground  When I interacted with them  I would know everything  Kind of like everybody  Working towards the same goal  In their own way  Right  Of course  I interviewed everyone  I want to fucking choke Jimmy 
[01:03:00]  Why?  I want to choke you out  I actually understand  Where he's going with this  I want to Vince McMahon  In your head  I'm not saying  There aren't certain things  That could probably be fixed  In post  But I do think  That it's a lot better  Everybody's just kind of  Razzy  I think busting balls  Is what I'm used to  That's part of it  That's what makes it funny  Sure  Soon enough  You're going to be dead  And it's moments away  Moments away  And the pain will be bad  For the first few seconds  But trust me  It won't be that long  Before you are  Lost in oblivion 
[01:03:30]  If this was  Let me say something  About what you just said  If this was  A filming  If he murdered this person  Yeah  And then tried to sell it  Like as a ghoulish  You gotta see this  Even  He wouldn't be convicted  Of the murder  If this was the evidence  Because the fucking cops  And the jury  Would start watching  And go  Just turn it  Let him go  Turn it off  I don't want to watch this  I don't want to watch this  I don't want to watch it  Until the point  Where I witness the murder  And put him in jail  Alright  The dialogue was kind of  Chilling though  Pause for a second 
[01:04:00]  Because I want to  Comment on his dialogue  Where you're walking  This guy through the fact  That you're going to kill him  And he's pretty much helpless  And he has to  Hear what's going to happen to him  What is in your pocket there?  I believe  That's my wallet  It's kind of a big wallet  Yeah  So why did you have  Your wallet  While you were filming?  Couldn't you leave that  On your dresser or something?  That's cool  It can't be  Oh my god  Let's get to the murder  And maybe we can  Stop this  Let's look at the back  Let's look at the back 
[01:04:30]  Of his leg again  There's a lot more blood  Later in the world  And you know  Most of these murder movies  Don't have a lot of blood  And you actually do get  A lot of implied violence  And a lot of things  That are pretty terrifying  Where are you stabbing him?  You're showing his chest and head  Where are you stabbing him?  Why is he working the lower torso?  I don't see  No look  There's nothing there  I don't see  It's below the camera  Out of view of camera  You stab him in the ass? 
[01:05:00]  We just stab him  Ass and balls  Ass and balls  There's no blood  He looks like he's being stabbed  In the balls right now  Look at the look on his face  Look how bored that guy is  He just laid there  He could roll onto the floor  He's like  Oh let me out here  You didn't have much of a budget  So why wouldn't you use  All your blood early in the movie  To really get people hooked?  Yeah  Why waste all the blood later on  When no one is  I see  Is still there watching  Louie's groans  Are the best  Like review  You could ever have  It's  All right 
[01:05:30]  Let's see how this guy dies  Will you try to purposely avoid  The violence on camera  Because it's like  Yeah  It's got like a  Hitchcock vibe  Exactly  And that's  Believe me  You'd be surprised  If we listed the amount of films  Where the violence happens  Off the camera  And it's implied  Like what?  Name one movie  Yeah  If you're not implying  Violence in this scene  You're showing that  It's definitely not happening  Because you're showing  The vital organs  Of the person  And there's nothing wrong  So you are proving  That that's definitely  You're making it very clear  That the person is yelling  For no reason  We're not seeing his penis  We don't see his penis 
[01:06:00]  If you cut off somebody's dick  And ate it  They wouldn't die for three days  Right  Thank you Louie  I had a long metal thing  That could have gone up his ass  Oh  Sure  It's implied up the ass  Sure  You could have made  A better movie  If you cared at all  It was $5,000  It's not even lack of skill  It's just not giving a shit  Three days  Remember  That too  All was experimental  And of course  Experimental  Three days  Right  That's not how you get reviews  Well we gotta give him a break  Because it only took 
[01:06:30]  You know  A month instead of two months  To film the movie  You look at the  What was the desperado  That Robert Rodriguez did  That was the big way  There you go  Now he's Rodriguez  No more  No more  Are you comparing yourself  To Robert  You look at Evil Dead 1  Very shoddy looking  But this is supposed to look  Shoddy looking  And this is what's not  Being acknowledged  The original Evil Dead  Did kind of have  Like a very low grade  Quality to it  But the horror was there  Right  Exactly  Hopefully at some point  When this movie is out 
[01:07:00]  And people don't know  It is out  No but I know  I know  At this point  I haven't really promoted  Yeah  I haven't really  Fully promoted  And I'm going to continue  To promote it  We're going to call  Ron and Fez  And then years from now  Years from now  Right  They're going to say  People are going to find  This movie  And they're going to say  What the fuck is this  And believe me  That's the reaction  That's going to happen  With people  They're going to be confused  Because they won't know  The back story  I say it now  We all know  Some of the back story  I'm saying  What the fuck is this now  But it's because  Also because you know  The back story  Yes  Those that don't know 
[01:07:30]  The back story  Will be more  No they'll just say  Some guy grabbed a camera  And some friends  And made a shitty movie  I think  I think  You see  You think  But you're looking at it  I don't know  You're right  You know something  You're absolutely right  Fucking Mall Cop  Was the number one movie  For two weeks in a row  He looks like  He looks like  In this movie  And you notice  I lost a lot of weight  You look good  I lost 60 pounds  In six months  Mostly from stress  From the divorce  That's good 
[01:08:00]  It's a healthy way  To lose weight  On the Magic Johnson diet  Only hope  Yeah  Now we get to  The world  Oh  Just a wow  Great  All I need to say is  Great  Great  We got our fucking  Wow sticker in there  Thanks for putting  A wow sticker  In the city film  Can we sue  That he now has to  Digitize that out  On every copy  That would rule  Please  Alright so the context  Is that I don't like  Mainstream movies  I am the fucking 
[01:08:30]  Target audience  Right  For this kind of film  This is shit  I am the closest  You're ever going to get  To someone who would  Give a shit  It's literally  And the reason is  Because crazy  David Van Vector  With his piss palms  And the fucking  Retarded Russian  Who I am one of  Eight people  Who saw that movie  They really cared  About how they made  It didn't mean  That they shot it  Like professionally  Or slickly  It means that  They gave a shit  They didn't just 
[01:09:00]  Fuck up  And not try again  They put some  They fucking mixed it  So you could hear  What the guy was saying  This is just shit  First of all  Number one  We know that  This is experimental film  Oh god no  Okay that's it  We know that  We go in that circle  And we know  It's supposed to look like this  This guy defend his  Bart I guess  You ever seen  The early films  The short films  The David Lynch  For instance  How dare you  Drag him into this  He has brought up 
[01:09:30]  Names of legendary directors  Artsy directors  And like  And then I look up  And just see  That  A wow sticker  On a car  What the  Did you do  Any second takes  Not with the  No filter Paul stuff  Because it's all gold  It really is  What  How bad is the  No filter Paul stuff  It's so  It goes on  Forever  Can we see  Maybe  Yeah just  Get to that part  It's right now  It's right  Oh it's coming up  This is it  20 minutes 
[01:10:00]  Oh the music  That's him  I still feel  The ball  In his car  Trying not to laugh  Laying across  His car  She's asleep  He fell asleep  In his car  What happened  Yeah I'm picking  Yeah I'm picking off  Easy gray  Now it's just him  Shirtless  Badly tied up  To a chair  Bouncing around  Like a cartoon character  So what  You  Is this 
[01:10:30]  Did you kill him  And then put his  Shirt back on  And then  No  I got him  He was  Drugged out  From a night  I had no  Intensity  That day  I wasn't  Getting  My message across  But that pig  Well wait a minute  Now you're both  Now you're talking  On screen and off screen  Right  Now you're  Now you're  Fucking narrating  And talking at the same time  I  As a  Not on purpose  No it's cause you just  Fucked it  As a psycho  I did  Edit 
[01:11:00]  And I did look at my  This  And prepare it  And he rips off like clerks  I was about to say  Why are you ripping off  Kevin Smith  With the dramatic title cards  With the wording  Words on there  And then going to  Different scenes  Well he ripped off people  Way before that  I mean like  Well  Kevin Smith  We're not arguing  Kevin Smith's  You know  Filmatic integrity  We're talking about  Your piece of garbage  I'm saying  That these are things  That are not used that often  And they need to be  Brought back from time to time  Right 
[01:11:30]  Yeah  Yeah I'll throw it in there  Sure why not  Yeah  Uh huh  And what am I saying  Interesting things  You know  Musical terms  Which comment on the action  Not  What  How  What comment  There's no comment being made  Agitated  With excitement  Agitated  Oh you mean the word comment  The words you actually wrote  Upon the screen  Yes  Ah  No  Yeah right  The message  Illiterate  Cross anyhow  Any credence to  Any of you worthless scum  But I will appreciate 
[01:12:00]  You enough  To avoid  The moral  Bankruptcy  Of obscenity  I'm tired you  Cucksucker  I'm leaping out  Anything he has to say  Oh my god  Because that's not  Exactly part of my message  This by the way  Goes on for  How long  Oh it's probably  A 15 minute scene  15 minutes  Oh my god  15 minutes  Of just  What you're seeing  Right here  Oh my god  It's Paul  Trying to get out  Of the  Shitty tie job  He jiggles and curses 
[01:12:30]  For 14 and a half minutes  Yeah just jiggling  Saying fuck you  Let me out of here  You fucking cocksucker  Fuck you  Fuck you  And then  Paulo is just  Rambling through  The whole thing  I think we're  Pretty well engaged  Back and forth  Because  Oh it's terrible  Some sort of a statement  Look how bored  He gets between  Strugglings  Yeah  He kind of looks around  Like are we done now  Hello  I'm tiny you cunt  Okay so then he does that  He looks at people  Off camera  Yeah  He looks at the 
[01:13:00]  Camera man  Oh there's another  Special shot  A little insert there  What's the problem dick  Looking at  I went to the camera  Adjusted the camera  Fuck you  Fuck you  Because I'm not  And we're still on that shot  We're still sitting on this  Insert shot of his legs  Why are we looking at this  Because this is clearly  Something that would not be  In a normal film  You won't see a shot  Completely ill  Framed like that  Am I correct or not  What the fuck is happening  Here Louis CK  That's what's happening  In this movie  What the fuck is happening  You understand 
[01:13:30]  No  You didn't try  You didn't try  You didn't try  That's exactly it  There wasn't any effort  No you didn't try  I swear  You got sleepy  I swear  You felt sleepy  Look it happens all the time  You're making a movie  And you go  Oh fuck  Could I just get out of here  And then you go  Wait a minute  I gotta at least try to  Even if I'm trying to do  Something shoddy  I gotta try to do  The best version  I need everybody  I took somebody's  Five thousand dollars  And spent it on  That fucking  Some weird clothes  That I bought  Here's the Ron Fez promo code 
[01:14:00]  Holy shit  I think we're finally  Even with Ron and Fez  Wow  For the Earl thing  Holy shit  It is exactly  What Louis said  It's not like  Yeah you're looking  Going holy shit  What is this  No  You would do that  If the movie was done well  And someone gave a shit about it  And then you would look  And say  Wow what is this  This is kind of weird  This is like  You just  Didn't put effort into it 
[01:14:30]  You said you wanted  To make a movie  That's the problem  There was more effort  In you saying  I want to make a movie  Than making the movie  This is an anti-film  It is meant  No  Just keep saying this  What is an anti-film  By the way  What you need to understand  Is that it means  It doesn't  Use the editing process  No that's not the case  Yes  But here  You see  When you  When you see a film  Most people are willing  To put the suspension  Of belief  Into a film  They know the process  Of making a film  That has all these edits 
[01:15:00]  Here we take the editing out  No you don't  Because you edit a lot  In this scene  Yeah you edit  That's the thing  You do just enough  To show that you  Didn't give a shit  We walk to the camera  Just enough  Turn it off  Turn it back on  With a different shot  Spike Lee made a movie  Called Get on the bus  About all the guys  Black guys going  To the million man march  It's about as simple  A movie as you could ask for  Cheap cheap video camera  And it's just single shots  Of dialogues  It's fucking great  Because it's low in scope  And it's not trying  To do much  Right 
[01:15:30]  It's just some dialogue  And there's no lighting  And some scenes  Are hard to look at  Because they're so dark  I was on a bus  And it's  Oh jeez  Man march  So that must mean  This movie's good  Because you took a bus once  But he cared about the movie  I went to the million man march  On a bus  Louie was making a point  So then you're right  It's a good movie  You're right  It's a good movie  Your point being  The point is  That every  That's  There are many many movies  That do what he says  He's doing  Right  Which is  Let's do away with editing  Let's say 
[01:16:00]  Editing is a  Is a pretense  The dogma school  Editing is a trick  Let's take the school  The tricks out  You know  Let's not have  A lot of people do that  That's not what this is  The caring  The caring about it  Let's take that out  The effort  Let's just remove any effort  And work  That goes behind it  The dogma people  That you just mentioned  And it's even more offensive  That you have the education  And know better  The dogma people  Because sometimes  You see a movie  Like out of the mouth  Of babes  You know  You see a movie 
[01:16:30]  Made by some people  That didn't know  What the fuck they were doing  And there's a beauty  To looking at it  Because of how  Tragically fucked up it was  I didn't know how to do it  That's even better  See that I thought  This isn't even that  I thought I was going to  Get a little of that  When I watched this  I was going like  Wow  Maybe  This will be fucked up  Enough where  It's hysterical  But  It just was fucked up  And it went on and on  He's deep  Wow  I think he's rimming  Poor guy  I love how Jimmy jumps 
[01:17:00]  When you wake him up  He's my  He's my  Right hand man  Right now  It's just like  I don't want to  Wreck the movie man  You're doing exactly  What you're supposed  To be doing  When you watch this movie  Yes  Jimmy I just touched  Your lips twice  With my hand  You didn't feel it  Did you  That's how sleepy you were  I was in his hiney hole  Gap in consciousness  Seems to be with you  I need a little bit of  Sugar  I'm a piece of a gun  Louie  This guy can't even  Defend you ironically  Without falling asleep  Truthfully you're  Busting my breath  Truthfully you're 
[01:17:30]  Busting my breath  You're not really  Giving me the benefit  It's like if you  Walked in out of the  Rain into a theater  And saw this movie  He's being Jesus honest  If it was raining AIDS  I'd go back out  And open my mouth  I'd look up at it  Like a turkey  And drown in AIDS rain  After watching  Three frames of this shit  I'd run back out  Into the acid rain  And let it eat my body  That's  That's busting balls  I'm sorry  Thank God 
[01:18:00]  Louie was here for this  Today  Because we didn't know  How to handle this  This horse shit  Paulo  Fantastic  I think we're gonna  Wrap up  Yes sir  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony  Show  It's the worst of  Opie and Anthony  You just heard  A long ordeal  Of Paulo playing  His movie in studio  And Louis C.K.  Just destroying him  Which saved a bit  Yeah thank God  Louis C.K.  Was there  Because otherwise  It would have just been  A bunch of guys  Watching a terrible movie  And we have an interview  That we did with Paul  Right after this whole ordeal  I don't like how you  Call him Paul 
[01:18:30]  With Paul  What do I call him  Paulo  That's his character name  Here's the Paulo interview  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  I am E-Rock  And I'm Sam  From Opie and Anthony  Of course  Obviously  And we're here with Paulo  Hello Paulo  Your life's in the movie  How are you  How are you  The director  The creator  Did you write it too  Did you write Gap  There's a discussion  About whether it was written  Or whether it was conceived  You know  In a slapdash fashion 
[01:19:00]  That's true  As we learn in this segment  There was no writer  Because there was no script  That's right  But if anyone wrote it  He did  He also starred in it  And if you haven't  Figured out by now  We're featuring a bit here  With Paulo  About his movie Gap  And Louis C.K.  Is in studio  Giving his critique  Of the film  Yes  He had never seen it  He came in cold  And we put it on for him  And for opening it  To watch along with us  And Paul  How did you feel  Their review went  I was actually very happy  With the situation 
[01:19:30]  Because Louis C.K.  Took the devil's advocate position  Which of course he had to  Somebody had to  And then of course  Jimmy Norton  Took the defense of the film  I think he did an admirable job  Because I think  It is very defendable  The movie is defendable  That's its best quality  I think  What you have to understand  About this movie  Is that it's controversial  It is a fulcrum  For discussion  And so that's what we had there  Was discussion  Back and forth  Well I'm sure a lot of you  Own Gap  If you don't own Gap  By now  Don't bother  But here is 
[01:20:00]  Bullshit  Here is  We should at least be fair  And give him a way  To try to plug it  And make some  Means to this end  It's gapthefilm.com  There is no other movie  Like this  Swear to God  You will be happy  You own this  Gapthemovie.com  Gapthefilm.com  Gapthemovie.com  Gapthevideo.com  Gapthemovie  No spaces  Crapthemovie.com  Right you heard it  Gapthemovie.com  And here is  G-A-P  Gap  G-O-T  Is it that series  That they spoof  Other horror movies  And comedies  And stuff like that  Right right  That's exactly what it is 
[01:20:30]  Leslie Nielsen's in them  Yeah they're hilarious  My life is fucked up  You please  If you have any  Heart in your body  Please buy this movie  Now the movie's  Kind of cheap right  It's not expensive  Not expensive  No but that doesn't  That's how  That was the reason  We did this movie  I have dozens of movies  Swimming around in my head  The reason we did this  Is because it was a cheap  It was supposed to look cheap  How much is the movie  Going for right now  $17.99  Oh Jesus  You know  Is that a two disc set  There's a couple  Digital copy  This is actually  The collector's edition 
[01:21:00]  The director's cut  Whatever  But I mean  The point is  It was for the  Members of the O&A  R&F community  Paul one more question  About Garbage the movie here  Gap the movie  What are the  What are the  Special features  On the DVD  That you will get  Lots of people  You know  Members of the show  You've got Stalker Patty  You've got No Filter Paul  You've got  Lene from Ronna Fez  You've got Eastside Dave  You've got Galo  Of course  My ex-late wife  And my new  Soon to be  Ex-wife  Not late  Melissa  Mellie 
[01:21:30]  And me of course  In the movie  So there's all those  People behind the scenes  I thought Dave  Wasn't in the movie  I thought you cut him out  Well he's in the extras  But we had to shorten  So that's not in the movie  He was shortened  Of course  They had to shorten  Eastside Dave's scene  To make room for  75 minutes  Of Don't Filter Paul  Saying the C word  So Dave's hosting  The extras  I guess so  We included his entire scene  And believe me  I believe Dave  Has a future in film  He's an excellent  Just not in your film  Because you cut him out  It just happened that way 
[01:22:00]  Because it was almost  He mocked the film  The way he was acting  But I think he's got  His face reads on film  And go to  GapKidsTheMovie.com  GapTheMovie.com  But you can find  E-Rock or myself  On PalTalk  Or the message boards  And we'll just  Burn you a copy for free  Sure  You can't do that  Because it's got  That protection on it  Oh Steve's got software  That we can get around that  You can find it on  BitTorrent too  I'm sure  I'm sure it's on BitTorrent  Fuck yeah  You better not  Or if you buy  The GapTheMovie.com  If you want to order  GapTheMovie.com

[01:54:30]  Coming up next  Are my Harry Bush favorites  The Weather Girls  It's me  The Men y'all  He made a demo  And we decided  To take it to Geronimo  The PD  Of Sirius XM's  Disco channel  The Strobe  And get some feedback  What did you think  Of Club Zodakini's  Disco demo  Um  You know  It was a little bit rough  Did he say  Harry Bush favorites  Yes  That's exactly  What he said  I don't know  It's kind of  That would kind of  Scare the Strobe audience  A little bit  You know  Referring to 
[01:55:00]  Weather Girls  As having Harry Bushes  You know  The way he sees it  Maybe it'll bring in  A whole new audience  Hey very well  But you know  The audience we have  Will go  They'll just leave  We get ready  To hit the town  In our favorite  Pair of crotch huggers  And if you run out  Of moose  Just drop a load  In your hand  And slip back  Your hair with that  The one thing  We try not to do  Is step over the vocals  And he was all over  All over the vocals  And um  Goo and dropping loads  And stuff like that  I don't know  If that works  For the channel 
[01:55:30]  Do you have anything  Positive to say  About Club Zodakini?  The one thing  I can say about him  Is he's 100% honest  That he is  Yeah  After a scathing  Review from Geronimo  We found Club Zodakini  To give him  The bad news  I have some bad news  What?  Uh  Geronimo did not think  That your demo  Was something  He would put on the air  His loss  Are you giving up  On the dream?  Well  I'm going country  All right  Well good luck  With that  Yeehaw  Going country? 
[01:56:00]  As always  Kenny is full of surprises  I wonder if he'll be able  To work the first syllable  Of country  Into some kind  Of clever pun  I'm primetime Sam Roberts  And this has been  Backstage  With ONA  Series 197  XM 202  You're listening  To the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  It's the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  I am E-Rock  And I am primetime  Sam Roberts  And E-Rock  Anthony has what 
[01:56:30]  Some people would call  A party house  Yes  A Playboy Mansion-esque  The compound  Is what it's called  Compound  And he invited  Mr. Jim Norton  Over to it recently  And Norton actually  Took the invitation  And went  See Norton was expecting  A big party  A bunch of girls  Snacks  Drinks  Movies  And he arrived  At the house  And  Well they wound up  Watching a movie  Or TV  In Anthony's new theater  With an empty pantry  In the kitchen  And Anthony  Passed out  And fell asleep  Hear Jim Norton's 
[01:57:00]  Experience as only  He can tell it  Right here  On the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  I think he rates  That as a positive  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony  Show  Indeed  I heard Jimmy  Finally got to Anthony's  Yep  To see the new movie theater  I did  I've seen the theater  But I hadn't really  Watched a movie in it  Yeah  A full movie  And I also saw  Star Trek this weekend  I had a really big  Movie weekend  Yeah  Nice  Yeah 
[01:57:30]  Went and saw Star Trek  And he was over at my house  Watched the movie  In my theater  So it was just  A movie weekend  Yeah  How was the experience  It was good  I mean  When I saw Star Trek  It was really quiet  I mean  There was not many people there  It was a private  Little small theater  Out there on Long Island  Yeah  It's nice that place right  Really nice  Yeah  Really nice  Were you blown away  By Anthony's theater  By Anthony's I was too  Speaking of theater  Yes  Yes  Anthony's was also very nice 
[01:58:00]  How's the sound  How's the seats  How's the service  Well how's the popcorn  The service was great  I wound up  Something's up here  No the service was great  We get there  I went with my girl  To  I'm like let's go to a movie  And I didn't feel like  Spending any money  So I'm like  Were you doing like  A king of comedy thing  Bringing your girl out to answer  Yeah  Now  Jerry  Were you  Were you as welcome  As  As Rupert was  With his little dame  Oh he was  Very welcome 
[01:58:30]  Yeah  Yeah well there were more snacks  For Rupert  We get there  It's like 11 at night  I'm starving  Because I did spots  I hadn't eaten  And I figured I would go there  Maybe I'll have a snack  And watch a movie  Yeah  So we walk in  Because there's always people  At Anthony's  It's just  Anthony  Alone  In that massive house  With liquor in his hand  Really  I was drinking my beer  And I felt bad  I'm like do we wake you  He's like no  I'm just hanging out  He's like alone  Drinking with a gun  By himself 
[01:59:00]  In an 8,000 square foot home  So what  What's going on with you  It was a  It was a night  Where there wasn't  Like  No you had built up  This compound  To be like  One big party  All the time  It's not  Every night  I understand  During the week  It might be a little rough  But on a Saturday  The night before  You know  There was some  Big party  Action  At the house  But  Saturday night  Was kind of  Mellow  But Jimmy just described 
[01:59:30]  A very sad scene  You  Saturday night  Alone  I was lonely  A beer  And a gun  Well  Very excited  Probably to see Jimmy  Walking around  Toting a pistol  In one hand  And a beer  In the other  As you know  I do  You know  Have  A sidearm  And in my house  You know  I never know  Who's gonna  Kick through a door  It was so creepy  We pull up 
[02:00:00]  And there's  There's just no action  And we just look up  In the window  And we see his  Two little eyes  Looking out  It was like  The fucking  Amityville horror  When the girl  Was hanging out  With Jody the pig  Her friend  And we just  So we're up there  In this mansion  And we go downstairs  We're just talking  For a while  And we're downstairs  Let's see the bar  And we get out  Of the bar  And it was  You know  No patrons  Just Anthony  Swiping down the bar  It's already clean  It was just empty  I did the old  I did the old 
[02:00:30]  Take the rag  And go  What do you have  And then there were  Some shining jokes  Going back and forth  Was he excited to see you  I don't know  I felt like  I was bothering him  Not at all  See that's why  I don't go there  Thank you Jimmy  That's why I go there  Not at all  But look at Anthony's house  You're like  I don't think  I'm supposed to be here  But I don't think  Anthony was unwelcoming  I think he was happy  To see us  He's just shy  And he's not too sure  How to talk to two people  Like and just be like  You know  He's just a shy guy  You can't figure it out  No  It's very hard to talk  To people that aren't drinking  That's exactly  What I was getting at 
[02:01:00]  I was trying to be nice today  That's like a couple  Stopping by right  And then as I'm  Trying to be a friend  Craigslist  It was like you were  Watching somebody  Just kind of feed  Their own demon  And it was like  That's what that's like  If I was trying to be a host  And play with myself  Through sweats  But we just had waters  But it was still fun  Talking to Anthony  And showed me  The bass  Which looked even better  Than the last time  I was there  Yeah yeah  It's coming along  Very well  And so we decided  To just sit in the theater  And watch a movie  For a little while 
[02:01:30]  And watching it  For a while  It was a bit of a choppy  Copy  But a really  I don't remember  The name of the movie  But I will say  It was really good  Yeah  I really fucking liked it  And then we stopped  Chad DePay  Which is the beauty  Of that movie theater  And so we stopped  Yeah so you can just  Pause the movie  Pause the movie  And as we're walking out  I'm like  You had these snacks  You know I was a little hungry  I  I  It was terrible  I had assumed 
[02:02:00]  That since it was so late  That Jimmy had probably eaten  And then got there  But he was doing spots  And stuff  And I  I didn't  I didn't think of any  I had stuff upstairs  You know some chips  And pretzels  And whatnot  You're in a tough spot  Because when people  Go to your place  They expect  Some white glove service  And when there are  Not from you my friend  But from the compound  Yes from the staff  From the staff  Right and Jimmy  Can't even get a chip  In his mouth  There was no staff  It was just me  And I'm a horrible host  Oh boy  I would have felt more welcomed  If he had held up his glass 
[02:02:30]  With a mark on his head  And went  Great party isn't it  And fucking blood  Came out of the elevators  That's what it was like  It was like going to see  Jack Torrance  Of the Overlook  Fucking  Creepy Anthony  And his gun  That's what's creepy  About living in a  In a big house  When you don't have  The action going on  It's a lonely place  Right it  A little bit lonely  Yes  Yes  Yes  Sometimes it is  A bit lonely  You should set up  One of your bathrooms 
[02:03:00]  Like the bathroom  From The Shining  The Shining bathroom  You really should  A mini version of that  What was it  It was like red or something  I might need that  Without Grady in it  As a background  Oh there it is  Okay  Make a good background  Yeah that's  It's all red  It's a really great bathroom  You could do that  In one of your  Freaking bathrooms  That picture we're looking at  Right now is Jack going  You chopped your wife  Kids up into little pieces  Yeah he's like  He's got them  On a point  Point of contention  I think Grady's  Personality kind of changes  Right about there  But yeah it was 
[02:03:30]  It was so weird  I went to Anthony  How come there's no chips  I'm not supposed to  And I said  Who said you're not supposed to  Well Jimmy not chips  We got legs of lamb  And ham  Cans of peaches  He took me upstairs  And showed me all the things  That we couldn't eat  We don't have no ice cream  We don't have no chicken  We don't have no legs of lamb  You like ice cream Jim  Well too bad  We don't have any  I got it  Sorry  We know  The snacks that we had 
[02:04:00]  Was  Mr. Turkle brought out  Oh no that was  Cuckoo's Nest  Right guy  Wrong movie  Anthony brought out  We had some  Some chips  And some  Doritos  Or tostitos  And  Some fucking  The worst wheat pretzels  Which is not his fault  Wheat pretzels are horrible  The wheat pretzels  They're terrible  Angela if you're listening  Regular pretzels  Yeah if you're gonna eat pretzels  Just eat pretzels  Eat pretzels  Cause they're not that bad  For you to begin with  I know  I hate the wheat pretzels  How healthy do you need  Your stupid pretzel  Ate them  But it was fun  We stood at the kitchen 
[02:04:30]  At that  If you've been in  You've seen Anthony's kitchen  It's fucking unbelievable  Boy have I  No one has ever cooked in it  No it's  Cooked in  It's the perfect kitchen  To really get some cooking done  I have  The guys from  Once every six months  Caterers there  I actually pulled the price tag  Off the stove  Yeah  But we stood there  And ate chips  I literally shoved chips  Which was very  It was fun  We were just talking  And we were just  Eating chips  Until I actually felt like  Alright I could probably  Take one more bite 
[02:05:00]  And just start shitting my pants  I ate chips  I never eat chips  I literally ate  Until my stomach felt full  Of potato chips  Of potato chips  I wanted to ask  Do you have any  Wonder Bread baby  I could ball up and eat  And fucking dab in the chip bag  And pick up the  Isn't potato chips  The greatest treat  Of all time  Phenomenal  The greatest snack  Of all time  Phenomenal  You could talk about  Your snacks all day long  But potato chips  Number one  Always  Very good  Always  Very good  Especially the salt  Vinegar ones  Oh fuck 
[02:05:30]  Is there anything  No  Fucking salt  Vinegar chips  Anyway  So you're chipping away  At ants  Yeah we are  Just sitting up  To bullshit  And ant is a very  I'll say  You do feel  Not that I  When we first got there  I didn't feel like ant  Was not happy  To have us there  But ants like me  I'm an awkward guy  Sometimes too  Like if my friend  And his girl  Just came over  I would just be  A little bit weird  Cause you know  It's like you're  Trying to be a host  But hey you're a friend  You're just  You're just my pal  Yeah  So it's like  To come over  And then I feel like  I'm hosting 
[02:06:00]  Yeah  It's just  It's a weird  Position to be in  Cause usually  When people come over  Somebody else  Does all that  Yeah  Like I don't have to  Worry about that  It's like here's this  Here's where that is  Fucking get it yourself  Kind of a thing  And that's what it is  Like Danny comes over  Opens the fridge  Just opens up cabinets  He doesn't give a shit  You know  And neither do I  It's how it works  I did go grab myself  A Diet Pepsi  Out of the fridge  Yes  You actually found  Non-alcoholic beverages  Yeah  They're in there 
[02:06:30]  As mixers  You gotta mix the booze  With something  Good point  Good point  So yeah  We just had  We went back down  And finished watching  I don't remember the movie  It was  It was some  It's a newer movie  I don't remember  What it was called  But it was really  Fucking good  Yeah  You liked it huh  Well casted  I couldn't believe  How much the characters  In the new one  Were perfectly representing  The characters  In the original  Nice  Just a great movie  Really good  And if it's still  In the theaters  I may go see it 
[02:07:00]  I'm not sure if it is  I'm gonna go look around  But so we had a nice time  And then I looked over  And fucking  Well there's poor Anthony  Fast asleep  Like the sweetest boy  In his own movie theater  And I mean  When Anthony  When Anthony falls asleep  I'm being polite  He passed the fuck out  Anthony passed the fuck out  I was just out  How awkward is that  You're with your chick  And it's just Anthony  Or you got some  Just Anthony  Just Anthony  Yeah  That was it  Oh that's creepy 
[02:07:30]  And you'll look over  And he's out cold  Out  Unconscious  So I fucking  When Anthony wants to sleep  He sleeps  Those seats  I've been on flights  I'm much too comfortable  Fuck that  I've been on flights  With you  Where you're  Heads up against  The hard window  Oh yeah  There's turbulence  Guys doing barrel rolls  And I'm just  Snoring away  Plains bouncing  All over the sky  And you  You don't wake  I like my sleep  Amazing  So I walked around  And I went upstairs  And I knew I wasn't  Supposed to peek  Into room 237  But I did anyway  And somebody tore my sweater 
[02:08:00]  Yeah Jimmy came  Walking down the stairs  Jimmy  I'm okay  Danny chased my girl  Up the steps  With a bat  So Anthony's place  Is easier to get lost in  What a fucking  What a massive compound  And so he was asleep  And it was just  Kind of awkward  Because I'm like  I guess we should go  I'm like  Anthony  Literally that loud  You couldn't wake him  No  I didn't wake up  During the movie  And the movie gets loud  That's pretty loud  At certain points  Yeah 
[02:08:30]  How the fuck  Do you do that  I was sleepy  And I had a few beers  Weird  My girl puts the key  I've said this  In the keyhole  I hate light sleepers  And I wake up  And I'm a grump  I'm like  What are you doing  I'm just trying to like  You know  Come home  It's not cranking a stereo  Or nothing  You're a light sleeper  I gather  It sucks dude  It's the worst  I like a good medium  To heavy sleeper  That way I can walk  Around the house  And not worry about  You know  No it's the worst 
[02:09:00]  You used to be  With a light sleeper  Oh yeah  It's the worst right  Oh my god  Now you know  The chick now  She's not  Light sleeper  Which is good  Very good  She let you out right  Yeah yeah  Well we knew  At one point  I actually forgot to mention  That we had been  We were eating chips  Towards the end  She came in  And we were all talking  So I knew Anthony  Wasn't alone  And then we went  Back down stairs  And he was so unconscious  And she's like  What should we do  I'm like I guess 
[02:09:30]  We should just leave  You should have  You should have  Robbed him blind  I didn't know  What to take  It was all so big  What do you take  The fucking island  In the middle of the kitchen  Take the pool  To your chief  You should  Just rip it out  Of the floor  You should have  Taken the chandelier  See that would have  Been upsetting to me  Lower it down  With the key  And then just  Take it out  The front door  If I had an ounce  Of moral courage  I would have  Lowered his chandelier  And then just left  And raised it  Stupid  That would be funny 
[02:10:00]  I'd wake up  Just knock into it  But we left  And I didn't want  To grab him  And shake him  See you up  Without saying goodbye  I couldn't  That is really rude  Jimmy  You can't grab a guy  With a fucking  Nine millimeter  Strapped to him  That's what I was  Scared of  I'd grab him  And shake him  And he would  Wake up  And go  What  No  We're your friends  I don't wake up  Shooting  I don't even think  About grabbing  A sidearm  If somebody  Wakes me up  I don't know  What he dreams  That's what  Creep me  I'm sure  Anthony's dreams 
[02:10:30]  Aren't pleasant  They're not  Dreams of friendship  They're not  Dreams of good times  They're usually dreams  That I'm in some  Kind of trouble  That I need  To get out of  Constantly  Those are my dreams  You probably dream  Like a dog does  Either bad people  My paws move  When you see the dog  Like just getting  Getting all weird  You think he's just  Chasing rabbits  Yeah you probably  Move the same way  A dog does  When he's sleeping  I usually dream  About people  I'm in two bad  Situations  Either I've done  Something bad  Many years ago  And they're just 
[02:11:00]  On to me now  With forensics  I hate those dreams  Or bad people  Are after me  And I really  Don't have any  Good defenses  You never have  A happy dream  Just some dumb  Little thing  That doesn't make sense  But you know  It's a happy dream  Yeah yeah  There are times  I do have happy dreams  But they usually  Turn into some  Kind of fucking  Monster or something  Yeah ghoulish  Horrid thing  The only time  I'm having good dreams  Is when I know  I'm dreaming  And then I could  You know  Rape and pillage  With impunity  Knowing that I'm safe  To do whatever I want 
[02:11:30]  Because it's just a dream  Those are fun  Get away with murder  Get away with anything  Yeah that's  You talk about that  Where you can control  Your dream  At the end there  That's creepy  Yeah yeah  That's kind of fun  Because we all  Have like the sex dream  And you like  Try to control  And the next thing  You know  You woke up  And you're like  You woke up  Like you're being  Spit out of a womb  Somewhere into this  Whole fucking world  Of Mars  You come out of  The Matrix  It's like fuck  I was in a situation  Man  It was nice and warm  Yep  But Jimmy  Yes I did feel bad 
[02:12:00]  That I wasn't  The greatest host  Like that  Usually I  Like I said  There are other people  That host  I am just kind of  The  You know  Hugh Hefner  Doesn't walk around  The mansion  Getting people things  You're just the lord  Of the matter  But he's usually  Got a bunch of people  Around  I didn't that night  It was an off night  It was very comfortable though  It was like alright  Dumbbell fell asleep  Let's go  Yeah it doesn't matter  It's like your friend  Fell asleep  I didn't care  But that's what it is  You know  You let yourself out  Fine 
[02:12:30]  Have you ever  Bought anything  Involving a computer  That has to hook up  To your network  And had it work  Immediately  Like a router you mean  Anything  Anything  No  That you buy  That is a computer  Or a computer like device  That plugs into your home network  And then have it actually work  Plug and play 
[02:13:00]  Never in my life has this happened  Using windows  Last night  I was going  Bad shit  Trying to get something to work  Can I come over and tweak with it  I think I could get it to work for you  No I don't think you could  Why  I could try a few things  No I've seen how you fix things  It's usually with a hammer  Then I'd finally get the official invite  To come over to your house  You've got the official invite  The official invite  They were shaking their head 
[02:13:30]  I'm just trying to keep the bit going  That's all  I know  I understand  We try to do bits  I went by  It was really fun  I know  Yeah  Now the pool's open  Oh the cleaning guy coming today I think  Yeah  Yeah I know  It was just me  Jimmy  Just you with a gun and boots  In the kitchen  While we ate pretzels and fucking  Shitty wheat pretzels  And fucking  And fucking Christmasy potato chips  Out of a bag  What do you mean Christmasy?  Just that Christmasy  Like that's how old they were  No they weren't that old 
[02:14:00]  Fucking red and green bag  It was still  It was awful  It was still fresh  Is there anything  Hey can we have some water or something?  Lukewarm water  Out of the fucking faucet  While he stands there with a weapon  No  They were bottled water  Hey you want to come downstairs  And watch a cut off version  Of a hit movie?  You can see up to the knee  I'm fucking Kirk  Fucking shitty night that was  And I'll pass out  Go to acute alcoholism  While you and your broad  Fucking walk out  Awkwardly 
[02:14:30]  And hope you don't jostle me  In a wake  Where I shoot you in the back  Fucking you're an intruder  Fucking horrendous  I love it  That is exactly  How the evening went  By the way  I'm standing there  With a fucking plastic jug  Of wheat pretzel braids  Wheat pretzel braids  Fucking digging in  And looking for  Some kind of a beverage  Fucking hard to find  A non-alcoholic beverage  In his fridge  The only reason he has water  Is because of all the dehydration  He has to have water  Holy shit 
[02:15:00]  He could not have described better  How that evening went  It was just so awkward  He was just standing there  With a beer  In the middle of this  Fucking castle  By himself  Not a friend to be had  Just alone  That's just the other side  Of this whole thing  That not many people  Get to see  Oh it was fucking  Depressing  Wheat pretzels  I want to go  Wheat pretzels  How did you know  I was packing  Because I saw it on you  Oh  I saw it on you  In between just kind of  Standing there awkwardly  We went down  And looked at the bar  And it was just  Ant standing behind the bar 
[02:15:30]  I was like  Well here's another thing  With Ant standing next to it  Well wow  There's that thing  With Ant sitting at it  Holy shit  Oh man  You know  That I can't even  I can't even defend myself  Exactly how the night went  Wow  Fucking warm water  Legs  Yeah  Fuck you gotta kind of  Watch on the screen  And half on the ceiling  Fucking audio  The audio's a little off  It was like the lips were moving 
[02:16:00]  And then sound would come out  Forty seconds later  Fucking horrendous  Oh  I thought you had a nice night  Over there  I did  But a bootleg  I would rather watch it  Through a Viewmaster  I've never seen a giant movie screen  Show half a fucking film before  Couldn't hear half of it  Oh and then the choppiness  Everyone was walking  Like the robot  At the end of the first Terminator  It's true  Everything was a little choppy  And he goes  You get used to the choppiness 
[02:16:30]  Do you  Yeah  I didn't  I got used to it  After the movie ended  And I could fucking  Finally see regular  They were all walking  Like the woman  Crawling out of the well  In the ring  At the end of the ring  That's what the whole movie  Looked like  Yeah  What's happening here  Is that a planet explosion  Or is Spock kissing a black girl  Holy shit dude  That is fucking funny  All I hear about  Is these fucking amazing  Shindigs at Ant's house  Oh you should have been there  The fucking Danny was there  The Rockettes came by  They all took their panties off 
[02:17:00]  And rubbed their clits on me  It's hysterical  You show up  One night  No one's there  It's just you  In paramilitary gear  Alone  No  It's fucking awful  And you invite us over  At the worst times  Because I've been in that  Situation too  Where nothing's going on  I know  I don't know what it is  The fuck  All we hear about  And then we leave  Feeling really sorry for you  There's fucking naked chicks  Running around  There's loads being spilled  Guns are being fucking  Kicked around  And thrown around  In alcohol fueled frenzies  Keep the cops having a ball 
[02:17:30]  And we show up  And it's just him  And a bag of Doritos  Right  Because we don't drink  So he invites us  In the off hours  The fuck  Then we drive home  Feeling really depressed  For you  Holy shit  You bring us down  To a level  That we don't want to be at  He's showing me things  That will be fun someday  Like hey look at this  This will make popcorn someday  But not when you're here  I don't know how to make it  It's an empty  He makes it  It's an empty popcorn thing  Just staring at me  My stomach is like  Grrr  God Jimmy 
[02:18:00]  And it's like  Do you want some rug shavings  To eat  Oh god Jimmy  Holy shit  Oh man  You hit it on the head  Uh Ange  Could you pick up  Some Snick Snacks  For the cupboard  How about anything  Could you pick up  Anything  Some fucking  Some shoe insoles  Just anything  For friends to snack on  While they're watching  Half a film  No wheat pretzels  No wheat pretzels  I hate the wheat pretzels  Pretzels  Eat fucking pretzels  I didn't buy them 
[02:18:30]  How healthy do you need to be  I'm a healthy guy  But I don't eat wheat pretzels  No one does  I didn't buy the wheat pretzels  Wheat pretzels  They're pissing me off  They're terrible  I didn't buy them  A big plastic jug  Of wheat pretzels  Yeah they would  With a big  Screw off lid  You don't have  Plenty to go around  He doesn't have anything  In his fridge  No just  You got the fridge  Stocked at least  With stuff  No no  There's  Not really right  There's pretty much  What the cook  Brings over  And she throws  Half of it out  I bet  Do you eat  Half that stuff  Some weeks  I do 
[02:19:00]  Some weeks  Not so much  Not so much  I'm doing good  This week  Let's take a break  Dan I want you  To check out our website  Before we give it out  To everyone  It might be a doozy  Also we got  Backstage with O&A  Kenny loves  A certain channel here  We're going to tell  Everybody about it  I hear Tom Hanks  Is making a movie  About Anthony's house  It's called  Snackless in Seattle  About a fucking  Snickers bar  My fucking  It was lukewarm  Tap water  I wanted to cool it off  I had to get  Jacuzzi water into it  I think I forgot about that 
[02:19:30]  Cold jacuzzi  Cold jacuzzi  And a warm beverage  Coming up  Was your warm water  A bit cloudy  It was fucking awful  Long Island shitty water  I think he actually  Just went in the backyard  And kind of rested it  Against the mud  Whatever drained in the cup  I got to drink  Only the best for his pals  Right  It was fucking awful  Why don't you just  Come in a glass  And let me drink that  Oh my god  He probably has  Secret compartments  Where all the good stuff is  When his real friends  Come over  No  No  No  The ones that partake  In the booze  It's uh  Alright 
[02:20:00]  It's exactly as  Jimmy put it  It's the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  You've been listening  To this crap  For god knows how long now  I hope for 19 hours at least  It's E-Rock  And it's primetime  Sam Roberts  That's me  We have a special guest  After the break  Sam  Who is he  I believe he is  President of the UFC  Vince McMahon  No  Vince McMahon  Is the guy who owns WWE  We're talking of course  About Mr. Dana White  And don't let his 
[02:20:30]  Somewhat effeminate  First name fool you  He's a big deal  He's a force to be  Reckoned with  He would fuck me up  He would  But so could I  No you can't  I could  I'll earthquake you  Let's find out  After the break  Either me and E-Rock  Will fight  Or Dana White  Will be next  On the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  The worst of Opie and Anthony  It is E-Rock  And it is  Primetime  Sam Roberts  And I'm E-Rock  And in the studio  Is UFC's own  Dana White  Where?  Where?  In this bit  Oh not in this studio 
[02:21:00]  No  In our show studio  Well that was quite  An exciting day  We've had Dana White  On the phone numerous times  Of course we're all  Huge fans of the UFC  E-Rock pretends to be  No I'm learning  I'm actually becoming one  You watched the last one?  I watched 101  Nice  And Dana is a big  Opie and Anthony supporter  It goes back and forth  And he finally got the chance  To come in studio  And he wasn't disappointed  It was a great  It was a great performance  Both by Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  And Dana White  He was promoting UFC 100 
[02:21:30]  At the time  He was promoting  The new video game  That just came out  100  That's how they pronounce it?  Yes  I was so off  Yes  So Dana White's in studio  And everybody's all giddy  And he gave me a free video game  Me too  No he gave me two  I gave you one  Oh  Well he signed mine  Yeah but I asked him to  It's Dana White  On the worst of the  Opie and Anthony show  What the fuck is this?  You're listening to the worst  What the fuck is this?  The worst of Opie and Anthony  You're checking out 
[02:22:00]  The Opie and Anthony show  In studio  Dana White from the UFC  Yeah  What's up Dana?  What's up buddy?  How are you?  We realize we never met you  Face to face  Yeah I know  We've done a million phone calls with you  You've met Jimmy  Yeah  The guys who have been out  To the fight I've met  I'm looking at the graphics  For this UFC Undisputed  It's almost creepy  The graphics are so good  It's really good  Dude I have never been  A fighter game player  Right  I'm usually  First person shooter  Whatever  This  I gotta get this 
[02:22:30]  Yeah it's  This looks so cool  I mean when Mars is playing over here  And he's kicking these guys  In their side  And then you just see like  It starts as a slight bruise  On the guy's side  And turns into this  Hematoma  That just  The guys take the abuse  They get cut  Yeah  The game's amazing  What's cool about this game too  Is that  You know  You don't have to be  A psycho gamer  To play it  You know  I don't play a lot of video games  And I have fun  Playing this game  Yeah it's 
[02:23:00]  It looks great  I mean  The graphics  The Liddell  When Liddell  Is announced  They announce the fighters  And it's like  It's got Liddell's  It's like  It's his face  It's like  The eyes  And the attitude  And the way  He kind of just  Bobs his head a little  And looks around  Creepy  I think it was  Cro-Cop  Shook his hand  In between rounds  Like a fighter will do  Before they go back  It was like  Ugh  Marcelino's playing right now  And he's  Rampage  And he is  Beating the crap 
[02:23:30]  Out of Chuck Liddell  At the moment  I'd like to see you do that  In real life there Mars  But uh  Alright Chuck's  Getting some shots in  He's got  Yeah a few shots  He's got a shot in  So he's uh  Wow  Damn it  He's got that  He's got that Liddell  Overhand punch  Now  Do you know anything  About how this was made  Because uh  Did each fighter  Actually put the uh  Motion capture  Yeah they all got mapped  Every guy got mapped  And went in there  And it's literally like  Uh  Having a remote control 
[02:24:00]  And controlling Rampage  Or Chuck Liddell  It really is  You know what you notice  You actually notice  Their techniques  Right  It's not just like  One guy and the other guy  And here's a right hand  And there's a left  When they punch  You go yeah  That's the way Liddell punches  Right  Liddell  Because Liddell has that  Muscle stomach  It's like  It almost looks like  He's  It's a weird stomach  But it's all muscles  And uh  He's got it in the game  This is really  This is probably  The best gravage  I've ever seen  Amazing  On a fight game  Yeah that's great  And most of the fight games 
[02:24:30]  You know  Other than  Like the WWE  They're all just boxing  All you can do is punch  Yeah  With this thing  You can punch  Kick knee  Elbow  Grapple  Go to the ground  And uh  It's really  Uh  This game's amazing  Yeah we were watching  Mars was fighting  Lesnar against Mirko Krokop  And uh  It was just  You know  Krokop was kicking  Nothing was happening  And then uh  Lesnar just got to the ground  And took him down  That's exactly how  Those two were fighting  Liddell's cut over his eye now  And that doesn't just go away 
[02:25:00]  Like like  You know  After the round is finished  And they come back  It doesn't just go away  He comes back  He's still cut  Right  He's still got the damage  Jesus  Wow nice high kick  Amazing  And they do  In between rounds  They do like slow-mos  Of some of the highlights  Of the round you just did  Can we ask  Working on him in the corner  Can we ask the important question  How  You got the  The girls  And uh  Their  Their  Their  Fucking breast moves  Like real breast  Motion capture on tits  I like to see them do that  Did you motion capture  The tits  They put the ping pong balls 
[02:25:30]  On their nipples  Walk across the  Track it  Walk across  Yeah there you go  Bouncy  Bouncy  Bouncy  They're  Fantastic  No they did an amazing job  So you know  We had a  We had a  When we bought the company  We married into a deal  That was already done  And the game sucked  It was bad  And uh  You know in the video game world  You come out with a shitty game  You don't get a second chance  So we've been fortunate  That the UFC's  Grown the way it has  So when we  Got the second opportunity  To do a game  We looked for a partner 
[02:26:00]  That would do it right  And really make a great game  And this  This game is literally  Groundbreaking  It's a really good game  I'm not just saying that  Because it's my game either  Because we  We had a game that sucked  And this game is amazing  There's blood on the  On the mat  On the mat  It's fantastic man  It's like  Dane I gotta ask you  I gotta ask you something  Because we're watching  Obviously Mars  He's got Chuck Liddell  And Rampage Jackson fighting  Do you feel like the UFC  Is going through  A little bit of growing pains  Right now  Because a lot of the guys  We really 
[02:26:30]  You know  Kind of grew up watching  In the last few years  Are all pretty much  Out of the game  Nah  You know  That's part of the game  I mean it's no different  Than baseball or football  Or boxing  You know  Everybody turns 40 man  And  Who are some of the guys  Coming up  That we really should  Start paying attention to  There's a kid coming up  On this  You know  As far as heavyweights go  Our heavyweight division  Has never looked better  Than it does right now  It's funny  You know  You look a year and a half ago  And people were talking about  How weak the heavyweight division is  Now it's  It's one of the best divisions  And there's a kid named  Kane Velasquez  Yeah 
[02:27:00]  And right now  He's 5-0  And he's fighting  On this card in Germany  And this kid  Is going to be  A monster  We think this kid  Is probably going to be  The heavyweight champion  In the next few years  But it depends on how  How much Brock Lesnar  Continues to grow  As a fighter  You know  Obviously  A lot of the talent  That we pump out  On the ultimate fighter  You know  In the beginning  These guys didn't get  The respect they deserve  Well now they are  And I think this fight  Between Evans and Machida  The guy that wins this fight 
[02:27:30]  Is without a doubt  Either the best  Or one of the best  205 pounders  Whoever wins this fight  Fights Rampage Jackson  So we got some fun stuff  Coming up  This is how you know  UFC is going to be here  For a long time  Like my nephew is 14  And Keith Robinson's son  Is 15  And it's all they talk about  Is these guys  None of them  Watch boxing  None of them do  They all watch UFC  They all have their  Favorite UFC guys  There's no excitement  In the boxing world  It's not that boxing sucks  It doesn't  But it's hard to 
[02:28:00]  It's just hard to get into  When you know that  You know what the problem is  With boxing too  First of all  You know  There's not any stars  Like there were  In boxing  When we were growing up  And you know  The problem is too  Is that it's just  It's just not that exciting  When's the last time  You saw  Other than Pacquiao  When's the last time  You saw a great boxing match  You know  Yeah you know  These guys are making  20 million a fight  And it's just  It's going to be  They don't fight  20 million a fight  And they don't fight  Oh that was a hell of a  Hell of a punch there  A short little left 
[02:28:30]  Do you replace  Yeah  Replace on what you just did  Nice  Do they incorporate  Like fighters weaknesses  Against each other  Because Liddell has never  Beaten Rampage  Do they  I guess they kind of  Put that into their makeup  Yeah well  You know  You have the exact  Strengths and weaknesses  Of the actual fighters  They did such a good job  On this thing  You know what's funny  Since I've walked in here  You guys have not stopped  Staring at the television  Watching the thing  Well that's good for you right  It's amazing  It's like it's a real fight  Trust me we've had some  Shitty video games  Up on that screen  This is amazing  We pay attention to guests  I mean this is a good thing 
[02:29:00]  That we're really into  That really is something  Because the way  It's like little weird things  Like the way the feet move  Like when they're kind of  Like just kind of  Stepping back  It's like that's the way  A guy moves back  They don't just kind of  Float back like a lot  Of video games do  It looks like you're  Watching Chuck Liddell  Well what they do  You know what  You guys move  Let me see the controller  For a second  They actually just  Showed me this yesterday  Actually I just learned  Yesterday  Let me back up  Before I get knocked out  Here  Yeah really  You're Rampage  Oh Rampage  With a spinning back fist  Chuck's supposed to have 
[02:29:30]  Great takedown defense  In this thing  Let me see if I can  Pass his guard here  Alright you got  Chuck down  So you're Chuck right  Yeah there we go  I got the half guard  Now I'm going to try  To get the side control  Here  Too bad  Kneeing in the balls  Isn't illegal  Chuck Liddell  Would be in big trouble  Right now  Yeah really  Chuck's on his back  Rampage is kind of  Kneeling straddling him  Chuck's like doing  The old punches  To the side of his head  I got to stand  And the ref just  Kind of ran over  Yeah he stood us up  Hey get up  Now back to 
[02:30:00]  Can you mix weight classes  Chuck's supposed to have  Real great takedown defense  But Rampage  Rampage can take him down  Apparently every time  Apparently so  What did I do  Well you have to  Hit resume  Great great  He gives you the back  To Mars  Can you mix weight classes  That's a good question  I would love to do that  That I don't know  I don't know the answer  Beat up some little guy  I would just take Lesnar  And then bully some like  Lightweight 
[02:30:30]  Some guy's 108 pounds  Just throw him through the roof  Just be fun to do that  Does UFC have a private jet  Nice  We do  So you're going to  Pick this up right  Wear Teterboro  We'll never see it  Just be at Teterboro  With their bags packed  Ready to go  Absolutely  The little UFC hats  All ready for the ride  Could you make a stop  At Republic  Because I really got to  Pick me up there  It's closer  More convenient for me  Yeah we'll look like  Just complete idiots  With our UFC gear on  Getting ready for our  Big flight to Vegas  I want to go to that man 
[02:31:00]  I would love to go to that  That fight was delayed  When were they supposed  To fight  They were supposed to  Fight on this one  This weekend  This Saturday  Is Machida and Evans  And Matt Serra and Matt Hughes  Yeah we had  Matt Serra was in last week  He's great isn't he  Yeah he seems very ready  He's definitely not shy  About shit talking  I like that  Well you know what  This is one of those fights  It's very rare in the UFC  That we have guys  Who really hate each other  You know everybody  Respects each other  And these guys hate each other  Hate each other  That makes the fight  A little better  It does make it fun  Let's be honest with each other 
[02:31:30]  No I agree  I hate when they really  Get along  I absolutely agree  Yeah  Hey Blue Heeler  From Kentucky  Right UFC 2009  Best selling game  Right now on  GameStop.com  Excellent  Doing well so far  Yeah  Last night we went down  To  We were actually in  Times Square  At the GameStop  Down there  And at midnight  They opened it up  And started selling  Games to people  About 200 people  Showed up last night  Down at the GameStop  How many people  Didn't go to work  Or school or anything  It's like you're midnight  You're not getting home  And going I can't wait  To play this tomorrow  No that's what they were saying  And then at 5 in the morning

[02:33:00]  A couple articles  Excellent man  For a number of  Online sources  Cool  I wanted to ask you  A question  With the passing  Of the unified rules  Do you ever see  There being a  Set of systematized  Unified judging criteria  That are more thorough  Than say  You know  The NSAC  You know  Judging criteria  That they have  Right now  Yeah I mean  I'm the one  Who's always bitching  About judging  And reffing  And I think 
[02:33:30]  It can always get better  You know  It's going to take time  When you think about it  You know  The unified rules  That we've been fighting  Under in the sport  The way that it is now  Is about  Nine years old  So it's going to take time  And we're focused  On working with the commissions  To make sure  That we have  The best judges  And refs possible  But I mean  Even if you look  At something like  Football  Basketball  That's been around  For so long  There's still tons  Of mistakes made  In football  And basketball  And you know  We're going to have  Those problems  Sure  Do you see 
[02:34:00]  A more comprehensive  System coming down  The pipeline  For training judges  In the future  Yeah I don't  I don't know  You know  That's not up to us  It's up to the  Athletic commissions  The different state  Athletic commissions  Handle that  But we do  Obviously we've got  Mark Ratner on board  One of the most  Respected guys ever  In any athletic commission  In any combat sport  And he's very proactive  On getting out there  And working with  These commissions  And educating  You know 
[02:34:30]  The judges and refs  Sure  If  Who do you like  In the Evans-Mashida fight  It's a tough fight  Man  You know  Rashad has been  So explosive  And you know  You know  This is a guy  Who in the ultimate  Fighter was a straight  Wrestler  Now he's got  Knockout highlight reels  Of you know  That kick to the head  Of Sean Salmon  Knocking Chuck Liddell  Out the way that he did  The guy's a beast  I don't know  I think  Like I said earlier  I think the guy  That comes out of this  Fight with a win  Is possibly the best 
[02:35:00]  205 pounder in the world  We'll just have to see  If Rampage can beat  Either one of them  I absolutely agree  I got a question  For Dana White  You're in New York City  When the fuck is this thing  Coming to New York  Next year  We're working on  For real  We're getting close finally  We've been working on that hard  You know the two states  We had left  Were Massachusetts and New York  Amazing  We could do a fight  And mass this summer  But we don't want to do it  In Boston this summer  We're going to wait until  You know  The way that Boston works  There's 100,000 less people  There in the summer  In our demo 
[02:35:30]  You know  Because all the schools are out  And then we're going to do  New York next year  Well it's obvious  Why New York is a holdout  It's the boxing capital  Of the United States anyway  You know  But what about Boston  It's not that they've been  A holdout  We really haven't focused  You know  We had laid out  All the states  That we were going to  That we were going to hit  Over the last few years  And realistically  New York and Massachusetts  Were the last two  And then we're moving up  Into Toronto after this  You know  We've got to get it  Sanctioned in Toronto  We just got it done  In Germany  We're doing a fight 
[02:36:00]  In Germany in June  We're working on France  We're bigger than U.S. steel  We're constantly working  On opening up  All these new territories  Who was the resistance  In New York though  Because was it the garden  And there had to be  Some kind of pushback  No no  The garden was great  Actually the garden  Has been great  Working with us  It's not that there's  Ever been any pushback  What you guys got to understand  Is when you move  Into these states  You're actually changing laws  You know  And that doesn't get done  Overnight  That is true  You know what I mean 
[02:36:30]  It takes time  It takes time  And a lot of effort  And work  And yeah  It's not easy  That first time  When you're in the garden  You're going to be  Out of your mind  You'll be like  Holy shit  You ought to see  At the garden  I'm excited for both gardens  The Boston Garden  Sure  That'll be huge  It'll be fun  Even though it's named  After some bank  Or something now up there  How do you change  The name of the Boston Garden  Yeah it's true  And it keeps changing  Every couple years  Yeah when the banks  Fold or merge  Or something  Yeah  No you're right  Is it true Mark Cuban  Is keeping you out of Dallas  That's coming in 
[02:37:00]  No  Okay  Are you in Dallas  It actually couldn't be  Any further from the truth  Mark Cuban has  Has been trying to get us down there  Let's go to Jason in Maryland  Jason  Talking to Dana White  We're checking out  His new UFC video game  It looks amazing  Great  Go ahead Jason  No we lost Jason  Let's say hi to  Rich in Georgia  Rich  Hey Dana  I was wondering  Is that  The league kid  From  The minor league  Group  Is he the real deal 
[02:37:30]  Or is he still minor leagues  Was it Kung Lee  Kung Lee  Whatever  Kung Lee  Yeah actually  I like Kung Lee  Kung Lee  Recently beat the shit  Out of Frank Shamrock  Somebody that I'm not  Too fond of  And  I like Kung  He's a good kid  He's a tough fighter  He's been around  For a long time  And I've been trying  To get him in  And possibly  A fight with  Anderson Silva  But you know  The kid  Literally  You know  You always hear these guys  You know  Saying yeah  I'm thinking about  Getting into the movies 
[02:38:00]  And you know  None of them ever  Do any movies  That make any money  Or do anything  But Kung Lee  Is actually  Making money  Doing movies  Yeah he  He's a great  He's a popular guy  But I didn't know  The reason I missed him  Is he has the ground game  For y'all  Yeah you know  His ground game  Isn't the best  Out there  But you know  Like I said  He beat Frank Shamrock  That means something  He was the first one  To beat him  In a while  And you know  You can never  Answer these questions  The only way  To answer the questions  Is have these guys fight 
[02:38:30]  Could Kung Lee  Beat Anderson Silva  Who knows  I'd love to bring him  In and find out  But he's a good kid  I respect him  And yeah  I think he's  A great fighter  Alright I appreciate it  Y'all  Great great great  Great UFC man  We love it  Thank you  I appreciate the support  And you said  You and Ashley  Krokop is returning  In June  Which I'm kind of  Happy about that  Yeah  I'd like to see him  Fight live  He actually  Krokop  You know  He and I  Have always kept in contact  And he claims 
[02:39:00]  He wasn't in the right place  The last time he fought  Mentally and physically  And he took all this time off  He's 100% healed  And he says he's ready  To come in here  And win the heavyweight title  So I'm real interested  To have him back  Isn't he on the parliament  Or something  And he's got like  A real political position  Really  In Kroish I think  Yeah he does  Really  Yep  He's huge in Kroish  I mean  When he was fighting  You know  He came from Pride  In Japan  Right  And when he would  When he would have his fights  They'd beam him over to Croatia  It was like  Everybody who had a television 
[02:39:30]  In Croatia  Was watching  When this guy would fight  It's amazing  All three people  In Croatia  Are calling on the TV  Hey Danny  You do any fighting yourself?  No  Because you started  By training some of these guys  Right?  No  Actually I started out  Managing  I used to manage  Chuck Liddell and Tito  But I come from boxing  You know  I boxed  Can you box your ass off  Or what?  No not anymore  Back then maybe  You did alright?  Yeah  Yeah  I mean I'm a promoter now  So I wasn't  No I understand  Well you shit talk a lot 
[02:40:00]  So I'm wondering  You know  If you ever get in a situation  Where you might have to use  Some kind of  Some kind of skills  To get yourself out of a jam  Obviously this is a crazy job  I meant shit talk  In a very  I know what you mean  A positive way  I know  Okay  You better  I appreciate guys like him  I  You know  I wouldn't call it shit talking  As much as just telling the truth  When you tell the truth  You know  People  They get shit talking  You know  And I don't know if you guys saw  The shit show  They just did on me  On E60 
[02:40:30]  On ESPN  Oh really?  These guys  Yeah  Totally took some shots at me  And you know  It's almost like  They don't want anybody  That's honest  And tells the truth  You know  I could go out there  And be phony  I'm sure  I could have  The lawyers write everything  That I say  And you know  I could go out  And give these  Yeah  Speeches  And you know  That's just not what I want to do  What they say about you  I didn't  E60  We don't know  We don't know  To be honest with you  Yeah E60 did this story  On me  They followed me around  For months  And basically gave  One side  You know  They brought up  Tito Ortiz  I mean 
[02:41:00]  How much longer  Are we going to talk  About Tito Ortiz  Because Tito Ortiz  Has been with the UFC  In a couple years  This guy named  Pat Miletic  I don't know  If you guys know  Who Pat Miletic is  And they actually  Came out here  To New York  To talk  To the assemblyman  That doesn't like it  Out here in New York  And basically  I gave  You know  They interviewed me  About Tito  And this guy  I gave them  You know  Hours and hours  Of responses  And they didn't use  Any of it  You know  They gave their side  Of the story  And didn't give  The other responses  We know that 
[02:41:30]  It's just such  Bullshit reporting  I talk about  Our Bill O'Reilly  Appearance  Over and over again  You gotta learn  You gotta just go live  You gotta go live  You get so sick of it  I agree  You get so sick  Of doing it  It's just  Whatever  Because they tape  They tape you  For over an hour  And the piece  Is only gonna run  For 10-15 minutes  In our case  It was like  Maybe a 10 minute piece  And it was like  Holy fuck  They left out  A lot of stuff  Exactly  You gotta just go live  So you know man  It's just like  That's what I love  About the internet  Right now  The internet  We do these video blogs 
[02:42:00]  I'll talk directly  To the fans  Instead of having  A middle man  Go in there  And decide  What they're gonna  Put in there  And not put in there  Oh shit  Well it's made a lot  Of that reporting  Irrelevant  Because again  At least you can  Go out and respond  Now  And go online  Immediately  And have the same  Amount of people  Watch it  Or more  This is what I meant  More people  And you didn't  Leave this in the interview  And you didn't do this  Yeah it's perfect  It's a way to fight back  You had a thing  Where you went after  A reporter  You had a little bit  Of a thing recently 
[02:42:30]  You know you had  Kind of the gay and lesbians  Went after you  And wanted you to apologize  And you did pull the video  But you didn't apologize  To Loretta Hunt  What exactly was your  Issue with  There you go  I mean that's exactly  What I'm talking about  This website out there  Basically this girl  Wrote a story  Not one fucking word  Of it was true  It was all bullshit  The entire story  Was full of shit  Isn't that amazing  They can get away with that  Yeah exactly  And they can't  And that's what happened  I flipped out  And did a video blog 
[02:43:00]  And you know  What words did you use  A lot of them  I used a lot of them  Carpet monster  No no no  Did you get creative  No no no  On the mic  No  What happened was  The reality is  It's not 1987 anymore  You know you can't  Go out and  Write these things  That aren't true  And now we have a voice  We can actually  Come back and respond  Exactly  So that's what I did  And you know  It was  It was a little aggressive  And  Good for you  And people  You know  I ended up offending 
[02:43:30]  The gay and lesbian community  Because I used the F word  And  Yeah  And listen  It's now the F word  Yes  No you know what  Let me tell you  I went through some shit  With this thing  It's  I'm 39 years old  And as being a guy  It's a word I've used  Since I was a kid  You know what I mean  That's how we say it  All the time  And when I said  This word  It was in no way  Shape or form  You know  Geared toward anybody's  Sexual orientation  So  When  When  GLAD came out 
[02:44:00]  And put up on their website  Basically  You know  They wanted me to apologize  The thing that sucked  About this thing  All these  People that don't even  Cover us  You know  The CNN's  And I mean  You name it  Name every major  Media outlet  All ran with  Dana White UFC president  Gay bashing  Dana White UFC  Gay bashing  Yeah  Anti-gay slurs  And all this stuff  Didn't  Didn't put it in context  Didn't tell the story  Right  Makes it look like  You know  I'm this homophobe  And I'm out there  Gay bashing  Which  Was the furthest thing 
[02:44:30]  From the truth  You know what I mean  You're using the word  In the context  That guys use it  When we're annoyed  At each other  Yeah  Exactly  So I call someone  A douche bag  We call someone  A douche bag  You don't really think  That they're a vinegar  Filled bag  With a nozzle  We understand  The common usage  In our language  And they harp  On the word  Exactly  Gotcha  Gotcha  Like that's what  People like to do  These days  It's annoying  Yeah  You say  If your friend  Isn't going out  One night  You come over the house  You go to pick him up  To go out to the bar  Or something like that  And it's like  Oh you're not coming out  And then you'll call him that  Or even just say 
[02:45:00]  Come on  Don't be gay  Come on out  And then you know  It doesn't mean that  Exactly  It's completely different meaning  At that point  But you can't  So did you apologize to them  And say look  This wasn't directed at you guys  Exactly  Alright  Fair enough  So then  There was a laundry list  Of people who wanted  Apologies from me  And I wasn't apologizing  Listen I said that word  It offended the gay  And lesbian community  And I didn't mean it  In that sense  I said I'm sorry  There it is  You know  There's that word  All the rest of you 
[02:45:30]  Yeah  Kiss my ass  I'm not apologizing  Now the shitheads are mad  Jesus Christ  Exactly  Exactly  Apologize to them  And I'm definitely  Not apologizing to her  Yeah yeah  She goes out  And writes a story  That's full of lies  What's her issue with you  What's her problem  Why did she  I'll tell you exactly  What the deal is  The deal is  That website  That she works for  I've had a beef with  Since the day  We started this company  Okay  So these guys  Don't ever write  Any positive UFC stories  Or anything like that 
[02:46:00]  You know  Listen  I was just telling you  How great the internet is  You know  You can go on there  And rebuttal stuff like that  But  Everybody thinks  They're a fucking journalist now  Okay  Just because I have a website  It means you're credible  And I'm  You know  We should believe  Everything you write  Yeah  Everybody has a website  And everybody's a journalist now  You know  At least  It has its pros and cons  Back in the day  If you wrote for the LA Times  You actually had to be somebody  You know what I mean  Yeah  You had to be a journalist  Now fucking anybody  Can just go out and  Hey  And they quote them  And news 
[02:46:30]  Like you could go to  Drug Report  Exactly  And it's quoted as news  Exactly  And meanwhile  Some guy or girl  In their basement  Or something  Typing away  And then it's up  Before you know it  The news is grabbing it  As an actual  A piece of journalism  Exactly  That's just someone's  Half-assed  Unresearched opinion  Exactly  Yeah  Amazing  And now this chick's  Running around  Playing the martyr  You know what I mean  Oh yeah  He smashed me  But you're a guy  That's brutally honest  Like you really  You say like  The president of major  Organizations 
[02:47:00]  Never talk like you  So when you apologize  At least it's sincere  Because you're not known  For running around  Saying you're sorry  For everything  That's what I said  I said you know  Believe me  If I had a problem  With the gay and lesbian  Community  I'd let you know about it  And I'd take you on  Head on  I wouldn't you know  I'm not going to go out  And apologize for something  That if I didn't  You know  If that isn't really  How I felt  We've got to get  Dana out of here  He's supposed to leave  Like five minutes  Why  He's got a busy schedule  With this UFC video game  The game too  Honestly  The game is amazing  I was watching 
[02:47:30]  I'm looking at Gonzaga  And Lesnar  Well Lesnar's beating  The shit out of him  Right now  But there's blood  Dripping out of his mouth  This is just  The graphics are amazing  Yeah we're all  Thanks  Could you put my  Disc in there  When you're done  And I would love  If you could sign this  Sure I'd love to  I'm taking it  Here's the deal  Dana White  I've got some more  For you guys  Oh do you  Yeah  Dude  I'll take one  I want to see that  On the movie theater screen  Holy shit  So where's the vote  B and Anthony

Primetime Sam Roberts  Did they not see your  Media pass?

It's just little people  How about eensy weensy  Do they like that?  Teensy tiny people  Teensy weeny  Insignificant 
[03:33:30]  Let's start calling them  Eensy weensies  Eensy weensy  What happens if you talk to them  As regular  Eity bitty?  You always make this face  Hello  How are you?  You know how you got to address them  You bend your knees  And punch over at the lower back  Put your hands on your knees  And look right at them  Scrunch your nose  And go  Hi  And what's your name?  And they love having their hair tussled  Yeah  They do love that 
[03:34:00]  Only talk to them in baby voices  That's how it is from now on  Oh boobies  So are the little people conventions in town?  Yeah  Where are our midget sightings?  What the fuck's wrong with these people out there?  I don't know  You can't get pictures of these fuckers?  Are they running and hiding?  Yeah  Hanging at the Marriott by the Brooklyn Bridge  You got them?  They're all running around  Under the bridge?  Yes  I brought the Ozone midget sighting to Twitter by the way  I got one so far  Yeah?  Yeah  Yeah?  Send me your midget pictures 
[03:34:30]  I'll repost  And we'll have  We'll laugh  And laugh  That is good  But not like  Don't take them off the web  You gotta actually get them  Yeah  Cause some people have done that  I'm like  I know  It's like stop it  You're lying  Posted a really good one  Some kickable at the bank  Kickable  Stephen S. from Bayshore rules  Oh we beat him up every day  But that fucking guy rules  So you went Sam  What was the big thing there?  Well I guess they're all upset about the M word  Yeah because we started  The M word 
[03:35:00]  Yeah  Which is  Migger?  Nope  No no no  What?  It's M-I-D-G-E-T  Midget  Yeah  Oh  What's wrong with midget by the way?  Because  What are they saying?  The root of the word  It was started by P.T. Barnum  And when they were  You know  He was a genius  Well not for the little people  No he was a genius for the little people  Cause what else were they gonna do?  He gave them a good living  Yeah  And a feeling of self worth  What does it mean?  And P.T. Barnum rules  And it dehumanizes them 
[03:35:30]  And it makes them feel as though  They are an object  Not a person  Really?  Yes  Well the rest of us were  We're building America  If their shoes are size two  Yeah  While the rest of us were building  You know  America  What the fuck were they gonna do?  For real  They could do the floor  Entertain us  For a quarter  Or a nickel  What uh  But where  What is the root  Of the word  Midget  Where did that come from?  They said the midget  Was first used  By P.T. Barnum  In the sideshows  In the early 1900s 
[03:36:00]  He said  You wanna see a midget  Right  Where did he come up with it though?  He just made it up  He's a genius  Yeah  That's a great word  To just come up with  And invent  Midget  A little midget  But yeah  They look up midget  And you know  Definition  Root  Origin  Yeah  But they're very  Protective over what media  Gets to talk to this convention  Because  Technically  It's on private property  Because they're all  In the hotel  And getting on buses  And stuff  And they were all 
[03:36:30]  In the hotel  Courtyard  The hotel  Owns all the property  They weren't really leaving  Did the hotel  Make them wear  Gnome hats  A little curly shoes  Just decorations  And through the fucking  Loudspeakers  That they keep playing  Da do  Da do  Da do  Da do  Da do  Da do  Da do  Pop goes the weasel  Is playing  Through every fucking  Hotel speaker  How angry would they be?  They'd be so mad  Curious  Yes  In front of the front desk 
[03:37:00]  There's like a bunch of  Little mini stepladders  Just things to really  Degrade them  Around how small they are  Everything's in child's  Portions  They all get like  Fucking like  Children's covered blankets  Children's colored  They gotta sign their  Hotel bill with a crayon  Yeah crayons  Crayons everywhere  The whole restaurant  Every chair  Has a big phone book on it  Yeah  All the rides  Are obviously closed  Nothing but a  Kids menu for everyone  Fuck  That's fucking funny  Midget  I would think  The et part 
[03:37:30]  Is probably from  The French  E-T-T  E  Small  Tiny  Yeah  You know  They are so little  Like et  But what midge  What's a midge  Midge means shit  Little shit  Yeah  Oh we horror to the midget  But why are all these groups  Wasting their time with this  Because  We're all never gonna get along  And we're gonna come up with words  For other groups of people  They're very 
[03:38:00]  Like the n-word  Is now more powerful  Than the word itself  Because it allows more people  To say  Say what they're feeling  Right  Right  Yeah  Because when you had  The actual word  It took a special person  To be brave enough  To actually say it  Now anyone can say  The n-word  Right  Yeah  For real  You just say  The n-word  Right  You don't have to actually say it  So what do they really accomplish  You made it easy  For people to actually convey  Right  That same thing 
[03:38:30]  And feeling  Right  And a hatred  By saying the n-word  And if they take midget away from us  Then we'll do  We'll do kickable  Yeah  We'll just come up with another word  That's what's gonna happen  Yeah  They would prefer  So it's a waste of time  Little person  Or dwarf  Or short statured  Dwarf  They're good with dwarf  Short statured  Yes  Little person  I don't think they  Dude what's fucking assholes  Short statured  Is somebody who's  You're short  Under average a little bit  Why do you put statured 
[03:39:00]  How about a shorty  You're a fucking short  How about short stuff  You know what  If I was a midget  I wouldn't want  How about half a vote  If I was a midget  I would rather be called midget  Than little person  Yeah me too  You know  And if I was a midget  I'd rather be called  Cock looks bigger  Yeah  Call me cock looks bigger  Please  How about sausage legs  Do they mind that one  Oh god  Muffin hands  Those bent up arms and legs  What happens there  Jesus  Oh and I'm a fan 
[03:39:30]  Of that dump show  On fucking  What is it TLC  Little midgets  Big world  Little yeah whatever  Little people  Oh my man  Little people  Big world  Little people  And uh  Sam went to the  The  What is it  A midget convention  It's called  The little people  Association convention  It's not a midget convention  They don't like the word  So  Of course  So what would they call it  Exactly  The LPA right  LPA  Was uh  Was the roll offs there  I didn't see the roll offs  I'm a big fan of that show  Cause I didn't get to go  To the convention  I just waited outside 
[03:40:00]  The hotel  For little people  Cause they were all  Just running around  Running around  Did it feel like  You were in a dream sequence  Or an 80's rock video  God damn it  You're right  Yeah  Always midgets in those  Did it feel like Godzilla  Yeah  You crushed them  Yeah  I'm Gulliver Roberts  I didn't get a lot  Of interviews though  Because they were  Very protective  Over what media  Oh come on  Because I guess  A lot of people 
[03:40:30]  Go down to make fun  There's no MNN  It's like  What kind of media  Were they expecting  So like people  Were  Just regular sized people  I gotta raise my hand  Yes  Just the visual  Can you imagine  A little  Little short  Reverend Allen  For the rights  Of the midget  The right of the midget  Can we speed up  Your voice  Fuck  That's how we do  This bit  I am outraged  Little Reverend Allen  Tawana Smalley 
[03:41:00]  Reverend Allen  Shorten  Jesus  We got a million  Of them  I touch  I touch  The little midgets  Get caught in your hair  And stuff  While you're down there  No  I mean they stayed  Oh a jungle  Oh wow  Let's climb that mountain  There's a jungle up there  No I didn't let them  Climb me  No  I didn't let them  Climb me  No  I didn't allow them  Scary  Did you let them  Just kick in the shin  No they were  We were speaking  Like civilized people 
[03:41:30]  Yeah right  Well they were trying  Alright well  We're not going to  Get much out of this  But let's see  You never know  It'll at least  Start  Conversation  Yes  So Sam talks  To politically  Active tiny little people  Joe wants  Average sized people  To stop using the M word  Holy shit  Alright we're at the  Little people convention  With Joe  Joe what's the haps  What's the haps  Well you know  We have 2,500  It's funny every time  Before you laugh 
[03:42:00]  That voice  It's funny every time  Has a wife and children  Yeah  And works with computers  So he's just like  Anybody else  What is he a screen saver  He'll come over your house  And run across your computer  Until you get back  Well what's the haps  Let me tell you  What the haps is  I got a stupid voice  He walks between the keys  And picks out crumbs  He's a fucking helium tester  He lays on his belly  And you use him 
[03:42:30]  Like a mouse  That voice is  I'm sorry  Funny every fucking time  It really is  What do you want from me  I'm supposed to not laugh at this  I know  That's for real  You've got to laugh  No you're not supposed to  Well you know  We have 2,500 little people  From all over the world here  We're all here to learn  About how to  Help the outside world  The average size world  As we call it  Better understand us  Normal people  And better accept us  What do you think  Is one of the problems 
[03:43:00]  That's like plaguing  The little people community  The biggest problem  The average size community  Doesn't understand  Is the M word  The midget word  The midget word  Is considered derogatory  Within LPA  And it continues to be used  Within the average size population  Because people just aren't aware  How hurtful it is  We're dwarfs  Short statured people  Little people  Persons of short stature  Anything else but midget  Because the midget word  For us  Is like the N word  For African American  Ah  See 
[03:43:30]  We started this conversation  Months ago  We said this is  Where it was all going  Everyone's just going to  Pull some word out  That people are now  Going to equate  With the N word  How about twerp  Yeah  He didn't say anything  About midget  So  I'll go with kickable  You go with twerp  Twerp  Munchkin  Twerp  Munchkin  Munchkin  They must  Hate munchkin  How about oompa loompa  Oompa loompa  Munchkin  They must hate  Get me a bonbon accident  Isn't it great 
[03:44:00]  Do they play soccer  With bonbons  It's got to be great  To be something  That people now  Weed out  Through testing  During pregnancy  Like it's just  Got to suck  It's like yeah  No no it's cool  You're you know  All the dignity  And everything you need  By the way  We weed this shit out now  Because we really  Don't want anymore  There are parents  That don't want  Kids with brown eyes  What chance  Do you think you have  None  That's why you don't  That's why you don't  See as many as you used to 
[03:44:30]  Oh  I remember when I  Going to school  There was always a midget  Or two in school  Little person  Midget  And now you don't  See him because  The doctor goes  I got some news for you  You know what's cooking  In that womb of yours  A midget  And they go okay  The old hoover  Or a dust buster  It's a midget  You just got to  Get a little  Nine months into  Doing jumping jacks  Yeah that didn't feel right  Well you need  One of those little things  You clean your keyboards with  Lair shots 
[03:45:00]  Done  So now we meet  Boarding  It was also  Horrible  Unnecessary  It was also impossible  To tell how old  Any of them were  I started a conversation  And realized  After I started  That I was talking  To a bunch of like  14 and 15 year olds  That were not going  To help me at all  You thought they were like  In their 20s and 30s  I thought these were like  Young like 20 somethings  They don't get bigger  No they're just that size  They don't age  No  Just different wigs  Timeless  Remember that 
[03:45:30]  Timeless  Different wigs my friends  We meet Charles  Who starts talking right away  And thinks the M word  Is the same as the N word  He's mad at Donald Trump  For using it on us  On the celebrity apprentice  Charles is very upset  Alright  I'm Charles  The word midget  Hold on  That's still Joe  No that's Charles  How do you know  Because it's a different person  How do you know  They sound the same  Yeah they all sound  I mean similar  But not the exact same  Alright we'll just have  To take your word for this  This is a different guy  I'm Charles  The word midget  Does is like the N word 
[03:46:00]  For black people  And I think that  I hate you Sam  Why  I just do  Why  Come on  You just want to bring it up  Because you're actually  Giving the guy a  Mmhmm  Mmhmm  Like  Mmhmm  He's making points  I care about your  Your plight  I do  Mmhmm  I do  Yep  Like a good little reporter  I do care  I would have openly  Just laughed  See that's not good journalism  I'm getting a good question here  So what does one call 
[03:46:30]  A black midget  That is like  A little African American  Person  Person  Alright  Is it  I got about three names  Yeah me too  That could be fired  Sure  Well alright  I mean are we writing down  The answers  Or  Oh jeez  Or what  Is that wrong  What happened there  That's terrible  Well you asked the question  I figured I'd answer it  What  Let's see  Oh no 
[03:47:00]  Give me one  You did ask the question  I think I got one  Let me see  Uh  Can you let me  Let me do this  I'll just  I'll just  I'll just write this  That's nice  Death  Of course  See that's  Of course  You know it transcends everything  Yeah the only answer you would have  Jesus  At least we try to make it a little fun  What  I'm just being accurate  We try to make it fun with our racism  All of them would be offensive  Yes 
[03:47:30]  All of them would be offensive  Let's get into this Charles thing  People  And I think that  Um  The  The uh  General population  Doesn't understand that  And it's very offensive  When you use the word midget  And I think uh  You know  Donald Trump ought to be uh  Feathered and tarred  For his uh  Celebrity Apprentice show  Tired and feathered  You idiot  Right  No you put the feather  What are you gonna  How does that get  Yeah but how's that  Feathers and then tar  Yeah how's that could ever work  Yeah the tar 
[03:48:00]  The feathers won't stick to you at all  Because the silliness to the thing  Is walking around with the feathers on  And I like his ancient  Fucking punishments  That he has  Why not just do what  They did in Braveheart  Have a midget come out  Play a little bit with the rope  Like he's pulling his guts out  And that scene wasn't great  Being tarred and feathered  Must suck  Yeah  Why  It's not like the cartoons  Hot tar man  Yeah  It's not like the cartoons  You get used to it after a while  Eventually  But it's more  Just very painful  And then you have to  The feathers stick to you  You have to pluck them out  I think it's pretty much death 
[03:48:30]  Yeah  At that point  Yeah I think you're getting  Third degree burns on your body  And they weren't very well treated back then  They probably didn't have good health care  No  No you can't  They didn't have health care providers  I'm sorry  Tarn feathering isn't covered  Under your HMO  Exactly  Only being  Only if you drown  Because we think you're a witch  How many times  Insurance  How many times do you say  Ow before you lose your voice  It's one long one  It starts when you get there  And it finishes  When you're fucking  The last shovel of dirt  Is going on to you  Alright 
[03:49:00]  You know  Donald Trump ought to be  Feathered and tarred  For his  Celebrity Apprentice show  Talking about  Using the M word  You know  It's like  Hey man  Why don't we use the N word  For a black person  You're here  Of course they won't do that  Because  That's taboo  But  But I guess it's okay  To call us midgets  When it's a very offensive word  What makes it so offensive  Why is that word so offensive  Very good question 
[03:49:30]  Sure  There's a girl one  Because it's associated  With the freak shows  Back in like the 1940s  1950s  It was kind of  A very derogative  Demeaning  Derogatory  Dumped what  So I think  That's kind of  Carried on  And just  Very offensive to us  Who's that  That's some  Little girl one  Was she  Attractive  No she was  Older  Oh  You should have  Got in her  Well you can't  Really get in her face  I guess  Getting that ass  Maybe if you  Got on your knees  You should have 
[03:50:00]  Got in her face  With her  Yeah  With her  Say listen you  Did you feel  Weird like  Having to put the mic  Down there  And go whoa  You know  Without like  Looking like  You're being  Condescending  Or do you  Just pick her up  Yeah  Didn't they just hate  When you pick them up  To walk into the mic  And hold them like  In the crook of your arm  You support their head  So why don't you think  You're being taken seriously  And you rock him gently  And he goes  Well  He goes to sleep  You give him a binky  Of course he does 
[03:50:30]  This would have been  My interviewing technique  I would have asked a question  And then went like this  Oh with the mic by your cock  Yeah  And a big black heart on  Now talking to that  You wouldn't be taken seriously  As a journalist  Oh wow  You should have dressed up  With curly shoes  With bells on them  And a pointy little green hat  And just gone there  Like that  And seen if they would have  Given you interviews  I think it would have been  Harder to get people  To talk to you  You should do that  You should go back  In that outfit  With the pop goes  The weasel music  And then just put  Your hands over your head 
[03:51:00]  And then spin in a circle  Like you're one of those  Fucking hummels  That people buy  Were they in nice  Little suits  They were dressed  Like we dressed  Some of them had  How do they get  Those clothes  Well I guess  Gap kids  Gosh bagosh  You know  Some of them had  Jeans and t-shirts on  Yeah  The kids were all  Dressed very hip  Like young kids  Dress  You know  T-shirts and jeans  Let's go down there  With some yellow paint  And just make  A lot of yellow roads 
[03:51:30]  Around them  Were there anyone  With a t-shirt  That had an arrow  And I'm with human  I'm with child  Of non-drager  Alright we continue  With another midget here  No I think there's  Another Charles  Another Charles clip  I think that clip  Is Charles still  Alright  Is it a word  That you as a community  Are trying to take  Ownership of  The way some people  In the African American 
[03:52:00]  Community try to take  Ownership of the n-word  To turn it into  A slang term  No actually  I don't want to be  Even  I don't want to hear it  Oh I heard  You're out of here  No  Is that going to  Affect you  Coming up  Some woman  That little  Tiny little woman  Who was there  Said no  We want it  Eradicated  We want it  Eradicated  It's like  What a coincidence  We feel the same  Way about you  Alright  Stop having kids  Everything will  Take care of itself  While I was doing 
[03:52:30]  These interviews  People who were  In charge  Started talking  To big people  And you know  Hovering and talking  Trying to figure out  Who I was  If you're outside  The Marriott though  You're allowed  To be there  Aren't you  It's a public space  We were in the  Courtyard  So they still  Technically own it  And none of the  Little people were  Coming off the  Courtyard  Onto the sidewalk  Let's go back  There with an  Attitude  You think so  Who wants to go  Back there with an  Attitude  Start bullying  Everyone or  Knocking around  I would start  Asking them  Travelocity commercials  Like asking them

[04:00:30]  Did a bunch of them get in one  And then just pile out  Circus music playing  Yes  What is circus  That would be great  If you pulled up your car outside  And just  Ba ba ba da da da  Ba ba da da da  Ba da da da da  They would be so angry  They'd come out  There it goes  One  Two  Three  Wow look  They're all piling out of the car  Seven  Eight  Nine  How many are in there  That'd be so demeaning  And they just walk in like fast motion  Get round in circles 
[04:01:00]  I think  No apparent reason to live  If I was the head of the Marriott  I would only allow them  To take three steps forward  Before they have to spin gaily in a circle  For my amusement  And those curly shoes  Kind of almost goose stepping with them  And their hands moving funny  You have to dance everywhere in the hotel  They have very little knee mobility  Very little knee mobility  Yes  Yeah their knees don't bend very well  Their legs are so short  They don't need to  Yeah

[04:08:30]  Agents accused Elgert  Of stomach turning actions  Saying at one point  He asked an undercover  Detective to send him  Pictures of the detective  Having sex  With his two young children  And the family pet  The pet  Why  Wow  It's a full flood  It's a  It's a  It's a  The canopy is off  You look like that guy  In the paper today  Ejecting out of his harrier  Yeah I sort of  Got out in time  Yeah that's terrible 
[04:09:00]  Oh Uncle Paul  That's terrible  I bet you think  It's terrible  Yeah the way  They go in there  And they lie  And they  They pretend  To be who they're not  Those damn agents  Ought to be arrested  Yeah they're  Pulling shenanigans  Yeah that ain't legal  Getting somebody  All worked up like that  And then  Yeah  Ruining their day  They shouldn't judge  What kind of pet  Did he have  They didn't even say  I don't think it matters  Sure it does  Probably the dog  Labrador retriever 
[04:09:30]  Those dogs are good for that  I would say  It's probably a dog  Yeah  Yeah  As long as it ain't a fish  You can't fuck fish  Yeah  Cause cats aren't as cooperative  No they're not  They're pain in the ass  I bet they're scratching at your balls and stuff  You're just trying to have a little fun  Now when you declaw them  And then they do that little mushy thing on your balls  It feels good  The mushy thing  You know they dig their little paws in there  And you go  Yeah  Uncle Paul's disgusting  They got the rough tongues  We used to call it making biscuits

[04:10:30]  We've seen that  Thank you Danny  Danny just punched up a picture of a girl using a trout on another girl  My bad  Well you know  Yes the picture's just called redundancy  Yeah the uh  I'm sure there's probably been like  You know the blowfish let's say  Has been used for that purpose  A guy sticking his wiener 
[04:11:00]  In a fish  What fish would be the best fish  Um  Wide mouth bass  I remember  I'd play a tuna because you're big and fat  I remember from my fishing days  The bunker  They were  They had a big mouth  With no teeth  Big mouth  The teeth weren't uh  You're like a grouper  A problem  A big grouper  Yeah a grouper would be good fucking  Not really because they look sad  They would just look  Because you're constantly getting the fish eye from them  Right  No emotion  So you don't know if the fish is having a good time  Oh that'd be so effing creepy  I think a nurse shark 
[04:11:30]  I want to fuck a nurse shark  I don't think that would be wise  Just hold it down  They're so harmless  Oh that's true  They are just big and lumbering  Alright here's the second half of the grandfather story  Within a one mile radius of Elgert's home  There are at least two schools  And the neighborhood is full of young children  It's not unbelievable  It's frightening  It's really scary  Investigators took bags and boxes of evidence from Elgert's home  They believe he may have molested children as well  And are urging anyone who may have had close contact with him to come forward 
[04:12:00]  You know when you see the authorities coming out of a home with bags and boxes  There's never any good stuff in those bags or boxes  No no it's it's  Yeah they come out with the big paper bags sealed up with the red evidence tape on it  No it's like  No that isn't just something  That's not someone's lunch  Toaster oven  Unless of course it was used to bludgeon somebody  Hey you don't think they can track who he was emailing do you  Uh probably  Once they get the computers  I know  Look 
[04:12:30]  They give it a good look  I hope they don't figure nothing out  Ah there it is  Danny found it  He found it  As a gentleman fucking what looks to be a fluke  What the fuck  What do the fish do  The fish is just like  Aww  The fish is making him  Aww  Yeah  Oh here to get one of those catfish you get from noodling  Oh wow  Ow  That's balls  Yeah put your penis  That's a video that would get a lot of hits  And the girl behind him has an eel 
[04:13:00]  So apparently she's been using that  Do you know how awful a fish mouth must feel in your dick  Yeah it's too like bony  Little teeth in there  It's gotta feel the same way your grandmother would feel  Oh god  Just thin lips  I know  Thin gums  Dried up heart lips  Bony gums  Except it would smell better and have more interesting conversations  You ever look at an old lady's lips and go  Oh my god that's what her pussy looks like  Aww  Anybody  No  No  And that's the worst  The worst
