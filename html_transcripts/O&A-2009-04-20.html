<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie detailing a frustrating encounter with a remarkably incompetent building security guard who repeatedly misspelled his name.  This segued into a rant about the futility and annoyance of small talk, a sentiment shared vehemently by Anthony.  The conversation then took a dark turn, focusing on the recent murder of a woman in a Boston hotel, possibly linked to a Craigslist massage ad.  Graphic details of the crime and the killer's apparent easy escape were discussed. This was followed by a discussion of a viral video showing police officers engaging in inappropriate behavior with an intoxicated woman at a police station, including the graphic details of the video and the subsequent disciplinary action against the officers.

Listener calls followed, with one caller sharing a similar story of dealing with incompetent security.  The hosts then launched into a discussion of the types of women who associate themselves with various professions, comparing "buckle bunnies" in the bull-riding world to the often unattractive women seen in police sting operations targeting prostitution.  This led to a lengthy segment featuring a Google image search for "ugliest prostitutes," with the hosts commenting on the images.

The show then inexplicably jumped to the anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre, which was followed by a discussion of Adolf Hitler's birthday, including insensitive jokes about potential Hitler-themed cakes.  This transitioned into a complaint about the stereotypical portrayal of attractive, aspiring actresses in news reports covering tragic events.

The show concluded with a lengthy segment on male and female sex dolls, including the playing of a video depicting a man having sex with a male sex doll.  The hosts discussed the practicalities of cleaning the doll,  the potential psychological ramifications of using sex dolls, and the broader social implications of increasingly realistic sex dolls. Throughout the broadcast, Opie and Anthony, along with  frequent references to "Kenny" and "Jimmy Norton," used crude and offensive language extensively.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice. 
[00:03:30]  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  On TV, I think it's called Three Sheets.  Where Anthony is in relation to the wind when he's driving.  I have a red light in my bathroom.  Wow.  We're showering with a chick.  We have a red light.  You're always thinking of how you can look a little better. 
[00:04:30]  Exactly.  So I have a blindfolded.  I have a blindfolded.  I had to go and she comes in.  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Hello.  Oh, that was a hell of a way to end a week last week.  Wow.  That seems like days ago.  I know.  Because it was.  It was. 
[00:05:00]  Well, I was just telling these guys, don't forget your building pass.  Yeah, huh?  They frown on you losing your building pass or forgetting it.  Well, on Mondays, you know, you're a little.  A little groggy.  A little groggy.  Still living the weekend.  Yeah.  And I ran out of my apartment without my pass to get into this joint.  That's a no-no.  You think it was bad over at XM with that one guy.  Oh, yeah.  Now I love that guy. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  I love the guy from XM.  Now he seems like Mr. Tolerant.  Oh, yeah.  He's Ted Tolerant.  Tolerant.  All we want in this world is for somebody to give us a goddamn break.  A goddamn break.  I think if you break down life, that's all you want.  Yeah.  For someone to give you just a break.  And I needed that break this morning.  And this guy was like, no.  Sorry.  No, there's not even a sorry.  No.  No break for you.  No.  What's your name? 
[00:06:00]  What are you doing here?  What company do you work for?  And he left his post to go take care of my situation.  Because I don't have a pass.  And you just see like a Congo line of people walking into the building.  Just blowing past them?  Yeah.  Not showing any IDs or nothing.  It's the typical, the cop pulls you over for speeding.  And while you're sitting there, everyone else is speeding.  Pass the cop.  Yeah.  It's pretty much what happens.  He singled you out.  Right.  You didn't have your pass.  And then everybody else, pass or not, they're just blowing right past them.  You make a great point.  Everyone's going 80-85 right by you. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  As you're getting the ticket.  Because you're the bad guy.  Sitting there with the dumb look on your face.  As you're just going, I'm the guy.  So he goes, well, give me your name.  If you're in the system, I'll let you up.  Yeah.  So I tell him my real name.  You're not in the system.  I am in the system.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  I knew here.  Right.  And then Kenny, because Kenny gets frustrated.  So he starts leaning over and he goes to the guy. 
[00:07:00]  You're not even spelling his name right.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Oh, dummy.  So then he spells it.  You're not in the system.  Yes, I am.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  No, you're not.  It's just going back and forth like a cartoon.  All of a sudden, Kenny leans over again.  He's not a visitor.  Like, the guy can't even get the basics down.  That's his job.  Right.  His job isn't just going, you don't have your past.  It's what to do when someone doesn't have the past.  In an expedient fashion.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Not just sit there and then clusterfuck the whole thing up trying to key in the wrong information.  Yeah.  God, what idiots these security guys are in 99% of the buildings.  And I just wanted to get upstairs.  And I knew this was going to happen.  I'm trying to get up here before, you know, the stern people start heading into the building.  Because it's like the first week where both camps are in the building.  Sure enough, boy Gary walks in.  He sees me at the front desk.  He's pretty much laughing inside.  I know.  I'm not stupid.  And then finally, the guy lets me go. 
[00:08:00]  Perfect timing to take the elevator up with boy Gary.  Oh, yeah.  So now we get to do the old small talk.  Chit chat.  The old chit chat.  The old chit chat.  He was fine.  But, you know, there's no story to tell there.  But the guy downstairs, what an ass.  I ran in and went into the elevator.  Yeah.  And then I'm just, I hear other people.  Like, I hear, good morning, good morning.  And I'm like, door closed, door closed, door closed.  Like, I don't want to ride up with anybody.  I'm a single elevator guy. 
[00:08:30]  So, yeah, I'm just like.  And it's not that you're panicking over anything.  You don't want to do that with the people that work on our show.  No, I don't want small talk.  With anyone.  None small talk.  Small talk sucks a big black cock.  Yeah, it does.  I hate small talk.  Chit chat in the elevator.  Stop it.  Chit chat anywhere.  Stop it.  No small talk.  No.  If you want to talk a little politics, a little playoff hockey, a little golf, I'm right there with you. 
[00:09:00]  But this.  What about water cooler talk, Opie?  Do you like water cooler talk?  I would just talk about the water cooler.  Isn't this water warm?  Shouldn't it be cooler water?  Here at the cooler.  How did that come about?  Do you think guys were just hanging out by the water cooler with their nice, cool cup of water?  Yeah.  How's your water?  Great.  How's yours?  Mmm, delicious.  You know, it's better than tap water. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, it always is.  The bubbles are funny, aren't they?  No.  Just have barbaric water cooler chat.  Like, dip your finger in the cup and go, I think Susan Smith backed her van into water that was colder than this.  Yeah, and then, how's the wife?  How's the kids?  How was your weekend?  How's your weekend?  Hey, how about the game?  The big game.  They're like talking about the game.  Right.  Right.  Shop.  So, there you go.  I ain't forgetting my pass. 
[00:10:00]  Small talk sucks the big black cup.  Oh, like, I've never heard small talk attacks or harsh like this.  Screw small talk.  Am I right, though?  It's the war.  I don't care where you are.  When someone starts there with that small talk, you want to strangle them.  I've gotten to the point where I have to put everything I have to take to work on my keychain.  So, it's making my keychain very heavy.  And then I have to put, like, this, you know those little mountain climber clips that are all the rage?  I do that on my actual car keys so that when Kenny goes to get my vehicle, I can detach it from the multitude of crap that's now on my keychain. 
[00:10:30]  That's smart.  And one of those things, well, two of those things.  Do you know there's two passes?  Yeah.  Yeah, what's the other pass for?  I don't know!  It's upsetting!  Just to make it more of a hassle.  That's all it's about.  Oh, shut up!  That should be turned down to zero. 
[00:11:00]  There's a building pass, and then there's the, uh...  What's the other pass?  Go on, it's just for serious.  Like, the one says, um...  Once it gets you in the building, the other one's to get you into this, uh, facility.  Yeah, but the one that gets you in the building just says tenant ID.  And you hit that against the thing when you walk in.  But then before you get to the elevators, you have to turn your tube card pass system around  and dab the serious ID in the lobby before you get on the elevator.  Yeah.  So you take the elevator up, and then you have to keep the serious side of the two-pass system 
[00:11:30]  handy.  Because when you get off the elevator, there's normally a guard who you have to now hit your  pass against the door before you get in.  It's so stupid.  What?  I don't even understand that.  Can we put the code for the other one on the same card?  Yes, they certainly could.  So then it's a one-card system?  But why?  They have to justify their dopey jobs down there?  And, by the way, getting back to my dumb little story, uh, it was broken.  And we just went into panic mode. 
[00:12:00]  And said, oh, I don't have my pass!  I could have walked right through.  Yeah.  And it was obvious that it was broken.  But I had to be stupid.  That's why, you know, all the criticism you gave to that other guy over there at DXCM.  I hate that guy still.  And I've waved every morning.  He was very pleasant to me.  I don't think I showed a pass for years walking past there.  I don't think I had to sign in unless someone else was at the desk.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:12:30]  You've got to make friends with these people.  I hate to tell you, one day you're going to forget it.  And you're not going to be happy.  Oh, not downstairs.  No, no, I know.  I'll be very angry.  How are you a security guard?  And you can't even spell.  Yeah, well...  So if there's a problem...  Could he speaky?  Could he speaky-ingly?  I'll give him, like, 70%.  70?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little messed up in the English department.  A little accent going on there.  Yeah.  How bad was he spelling your name?  Did Kenny say how he spelled it?  I don't know.  Anthony Cumia. 
[00:13:00]  But Kenny was being professional but very frustrated.  That's not how you spell it.  He's not a visitor.  It's S-W-E-E-T-I-E-P-I-E.  It's long spelling for a joke, isn't it?  Well, it's all right.  Sometimes long spelling is what it takes.  Not this time, apparently.  I actually did.  I know.  I hate to cry wolf.  I didn't hear it because I just saw Craigslist Killer, Vic's handcuffed.  I just looked at that and I missed the spelling.  Oh, they got it?  No, I don't know.  But they said that Craigslist Killer is handcuffed all through Vic. 
[00:13:30]  They don't have that guy yet.  No, they don't.  There's a great video of him and everything in the lobby of that hotel.  I was reading about that.  Bring everyone up to speed, Jimmy, because you got the article in front of you.  It's just a guy.  He was killed.  He shot a girl in Boston, which I think was a robbery gone wrong.  Did he shoot her in the hotel room?  I believe he did.  Yeah, it was in a Marriott.  Yeah, I think they heard him screaming.  Screaming.  So that's what my guess is that he was robbing her.  Screaming and shooting her and no one next door is noticing that all hell's breaking loose?  Hotel, you think it's a pay-per-view or something. 
[00:14:00]  Watching the latest action flick.  Oh, my God, right?  That hot new movie, Don't Shoot Me, Sir.  I'm guessing it was 20th floor.  So I'm assuming that he went to rob her, maybe assault her or whatever.  But when she screamed, he probably shot her because you can't just run out of the room and leave the premises.  You're on the 20th floor.  Like in a motel, you can just get the fuck out of there.  You scream and the guy can leave.  But 20th floor, we're going to do a ding.  You know, she's fucking screaming, holy hell, in the room.  Can we wait for the hoiter? 
[00:14:30]  Was she an all-in prostitute, you think?  I don't know.  Because they're saying she was a model.  She was beautiful.  Yeah, pretty girl.  And she was doing some masseuses on the side or massaging on the side.  What do you think, though?  Come on.  Through the Craigslist.  She probably did something, yeah.  Yeah, she probably did a little of the, well, Jimmy's a pro on this, a little of the Yankee Cranky, you think?  I have to see her ad, but some of these girls fuck, and some of these girls just do a little  bit of a hand release, and it all depends on the girl and how much she's making.  Yeah, some of them won't bang you. 
[00:15:00]  I mean, there are girls that just won't sell the pussy.  They just won't do it.  Like, for them, it's the hand.  It goes no farther.  I think for the right price.  Most of them, I think you're right.  You can.  You know, say $10, and they're all over it.  Well, if you want to, you know, if you want a weekend, I mean, you know.  A girlfriend experience.  And they're saying there's three of these incidents?  Yeah, where he, uh.  This is the only one that's killed, though, right?  The only one that's dead.  They said this Craigslist killed.  He's used plastic handcuffs on all three of the women, and he's been on, like, a week-long 
[00:15:30]  spree, and they said it's the common link.  This one girl, her name was Julissa Brisbane.  It was, like, a bullet.  Her body was bullet-ridden, and, you know, she was, like, an aspiring actress who offered sensual massages.  What is an aspiring actress?  I'm so sick of hearing that, too.  It's probably what she told her family she was working on.  We're going to bitch and complain a little bit today.  It's what you're doing when you're in jobs that can get you riddled with bullets.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Aspiring actress, that means nothing.  Water cooler talk means nothing. 
[00:16:00]  I'm an aspiring astronaut, by the way.  I'm a radio host, but I'm an aspiring astronaut.  What are the odds?  I'm an aspiring golfer, so there you go.  There you go.  Still have a dream of making the, well, at this point, the senior tour.  You're going to?  Well, aspiring actress.  Here's the thing.  She may have wanted to act, but to live in New York and make New York money, make rent.  Yeah.  You have to have a job where you're making a decent amount of coin. 
[00:16:30]  Sure.  What kind of job can you do where, like, you can make enough money to live in New York City,  but still go on auditions and stuff like that?  Claw.  Claw.  Claw.  Yeah, it's fucking tough.  It's possible.  Hey, at least they got that.  You know?  It's like if you're a guy and you're an aspiring actor, you got to wait tables.  Yeah.  You can't go, you know, oh, male prostitute sounds fine if you think you're going to go  out banging girls, but that just doesn't happen with guys.  John Voight showed us what happened.  Yeah.  Exactatick attackily. 
[00:17:00]  But I think you guys are missing the point.  Aspiring actress means nothing.  It should be trying to be an actress.  Yeah.  Wants to be an actress.  Hoping to be an actress.  Aspiring actress means nothing.  And they use it in the paper all the time when somebody's tragically killed.  All the time.  If you have another one of these, give us a call because I want to bitch about all  of them.  Hey, the one thing, we're sort of saying it, and then we went for the facts of the story.  The guy just nonchalantly, after he killed her by shooting her a bunch of times, walks 
[00:17:30]  through the lobby like nothing.  Yeah.  Looks at the camera pretty much.  They got a pretty good view of this guy.  I don't care what the-  The white guy.  I don't care what the camera's saying.  I mean, if you're that guy walking through that lobby, you're like, all right, be cool,  be cool.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, be cool.  Ah, what are you doing?  Don't look over there.  Just walk.  Turn your head a little bit.  Right.  Just look at the front door.  Get to the front door.  Get to the front door.  It's like this place.  The camera's all over the place.  You just put my head down and walk out, just in case anybody's-  Just in case David's bullet-riddled body is found. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, you gotta make-  Inspiring douchebag.  He made it.  You gotta make-  You made it.  You gotta make believe there's not ten cameras on you at every time.  Yeah.  Every single moment.  What's that about?  Who's the paranoid guy around here?  They don't want any pilfering?  Is it for pilfering of paperclips?  I don't know.  Or is it for workplace violence and harassment?  Like, what is the-  What are the reasons for so many cameras in this joint?  I don't know.  The other place only had them out in the hallway, and that was because the building didn't trust us. 
[00:18:30]  There was always nude women running to the bathroom, getting us in trouble.  Sometimes covered in-  Or nude gentlemen.  Well, the nude women-  Tippy Tom.  Bloody running out of the building.  That was always a treat for the rest of the people that worked in that building, huh?  Ha, ha, ha.  Oops.  Yeah.  We should set that up today.  Bloody girl, fake blood running through the lobby of this building.  Yeah, that-  Give them a big how you do today.  That'll get us thrown out. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, I know.  Can't have fun anymore.  Nah, there's no real fun in the hallways.  We give it a shot, but, eh.  Speaking of harassment, I was watching cop videos last night on YouTube.  Yeah.  Because of what I was telling you, maybe I'll bring it up later.  Eh, whatever.  I was really fast.  I was down in Philly.  It was a story we covered last May.  A story you heard here first.  I think there were two or three guys that were beat up pretty good by cops. 
[00:19:30]  They were being kicked about, and they had helicopter footage of the guys.  It was a big, huge story in Philly.  Actually, it went national.  Busy body helicopter.  It went national.  I was at a party on Saturday with one of the guys that was part of that incident and  had to take the fall for the incident and lost his job.  Really, yeah.  And he even said, look, he explained who he was on the video, and I was able to see which  one he was, and he did exactly what everyone else was doing.  He's a YouTube sensation.  Oh, yeah, he is.  He goes, oh, you'll see me on the video. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to blow up his spot because there's a pretty big case going on about this  whole thing, but he lost his job, and they decided to have him take the fall and another  guy, and that was it, even though it was like 13 or 15 guys or something like that all doing  the same thing.  Uh-huh.  A bunch of horse shit, to be honest with you, but it's kind of like our situation.  Just fire everybody and cover your own ass.  Yeah.  He's like a huge fan of the show, which, you know, whatever.  But then I went and saw that video, which led me to more cop videos. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, yeah, they're so much fun.  Have you guys seen, and it has like 8 million views, the woman that's at the police station,  and maybe Danny can find it.  Is it the one that's sitting there and then gets up in the guy's face and falls over?  Well, basically the story goes, this girl has a very tiny, like, jean skirt on.  And really, it looks like she's put together nice.  It's hard on these, like, you know, these videos, obviously. 
[00:21:00]  And then they pixelate her face, but she looks really hot.  And the person she was with got pulled over for drunk driving.  But she was okay.  So they brought her to the station as well.  And now she needs a ride home.  So she's there for a couple hours.  It's like 4 in the morning.  And the cops are just like kind of doing a little squeezy-squeezy.  A little grab-ass.  A little grab-ass.  And then she's, like, getting up on the counter and stuff.  And I guess she doesn't have underwear on.  And the cops are coming out, and they're snapping pictures with their cell phones. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, I didn't see that one, no.  The perf switch must have went off because they all know there's cameras there.  And they got caught on the surveillance cameras.  And a bunch of guys got fired for this incident.  But the video, it's okay because it's surveillance footage.  A little grainy.  But you can see what they're doing.  She goes in the back room, and one of the guys, like, lifts her skirt up as she's going into the other room.  Dude, she was so â€“ that was such a sexy video.  Wow.  Because you can picture yourself â€“  You've seen it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The drunk â€“ the girl who was â€“ those cops got fired. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  It was â€“  I don't know how you find it, Danny.  The â€“ if you put drunk girl on â€“  Drunk.  Drunk girl stripping in police station or something, like, she was â€“ you'll find â€“ she's not hard to find.  But she was super sexy, man.  It was the idea that we've all seen a girl that drunk, and, like, you just know you can reach under her skirt and touch her ass, and you won't get yelled at.  It was really hot, man.  This might be it right here.  Oh, police tape released.  Yeah, it's some news footage, I guess.  Get the cops alone.  Yeah, it's a lot.  They're just having a little fun. 
[00:22:30]  You know what?  Yeah, this girl.  Wow.  She's got the big white boots on, tiny little skirt, white shirt, dark hair.  I'm in love with her.  Yeah, there's something really â€“ you've got to be honest.  There's something really hot about this.  What have we got here?  Her alcohol consumption.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think she was complaining about the attention she was getting.  Look at this Club Soda Kenny-looking guy.  Yeah.  With his beady eyes.  He has to be â€“ and she just puts on â€“  Oh, look at what she's doing.  Come on.  She's got her leg up on the counter.  One leg. 
[00:23:00]  One leg way up on the counter.  Watch when she goes in the back room, man.  We'll give you the link to this video.  She's asking for it.  Watch.  Look.  A little grab ass.  Oh, look.  She's backing up.  She's holding onto the door jam.  And backing her ass up.  A cop's behind her.  She's pressing on his dick.  Yeah, she's backing up, lifting the skirt up.  Yeah.  How do you not touch her?  She's so hot.  There's something really hot about this.  She's laying on the counter.  Yeah.  Oh, come on, dude.  As she leans over, her tiny little skirt pops up even more.  Oh, yeah.  Now she's on all fours on the top of the counter. 
[00:23:30]  A cop with a cell phone.  And then the cop with a cell phone camera just walks out.  He just walks out.  I needed a photographic evidence of â€“  Oh, you think that's what his â€“  Oh, it had to be.  Yeah.  I was just trying to get evidence.  Yeah.  Look at these other guys behind the counter.  They're taking pictures.  She's lifting her skirt up.  I guess it's inappropriate behavior for the station.  You have to fire them, though.  God, take a guy's fucking pension.  Fucking assholes.  Yeah.  It's obvious she wanted it. 
[00:24:00]  She's being a whore.  She did, though, but it's not like they attacked her.  It's like, what do you do?  You're a fucking bunch of guys.  Yeah.  We trust these guys to carry guns.  You need testosterone to do that.  You know, and a chick shows her ass.  They're not supposed to look at it.  Yeah.  Cops do have a â€“  What's the link to that, Danny, for the people that haven't seen it yet?  That's so much crap to put up with.  It's on our YouTube.  I know.  If you search police, take advantage of a drunk girl.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  But why do they always make those titles so vague? 
[00:24:30]  Can't really figure out what's going on in the video.  All right.  That's fantastic.  Mike T. in Jersey.  Opie, I work at New Jersey Transit, Rail Center, and Kearney.  Same idiots here.  Same S.  Oh, same shit.  I forget sometimes.  We're just on the satellite right now.  Yeah.  Open the trunk.  What's your pass number?  Same as yesterday.  You're not on the list.  Employee ID.  Why are you here?  And the security guards here are all ex-cons anyway. 
[00:25:00]  Ex-cons.  That's wonderful.  You've got to answer to that.  They have to power, and they have to make your life just miserable.  Wonderful.  Sounds like a badge bunny.  Mike T. in Jersey again.  Badge bunny?  Yeah.  Two for two for Mike T.  A lot of cop groupies.  Chicks.  Try to get out of tickets.  What was the bull riding?  Beautiful girls.  And there's a name for all of them.  Remember when I went to that bull riding and buckle bunnies?  What was it called again? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah, right?  Because the big belt buckles that the cowboys wear?  Are they buckle bunnies?  Yeah, there's a name for the girls that are hitting on the riders in the bull riding league.  Lot lizards or the trucker girls.  Those are probably the bottom of the barrel.  No, you've got to think.  Comedians groupies are fat men.  Probably buckle bunnies.  That sounds right.  I forget.  There was a name.  It must be.  Have you ever, not ever, but when you're watching Cops or one of those police shows where they're 
[00:26:00]  doing a sting operation on prostitution, you ever see attractive prostitutes on that show?  It's amazing how many old, cracked out, toothless bitches are on those shows.  It's like, oh, yeah, we've arrested you before.  Or, you're familiar.  Oh, I was just out here.  It's your friend.  I was talking in the window. 
[00:26:30]  And they got those, the big sunken in lips with the wrinkles around them.  How bad do you need a blowjob?  I know.  That's a little rough.  That's what I'm thinking.  Look at this.  That's a little rough.  These are prostitutes.  Yeah.  Danny's scrolling through the real prostitutes that you get.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  It looks like Opie.  Go up.  Let's go.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  You're not right, though.  They're all aspiring actresses, too. 
[00:27:00]  That is a hot one.  There's nothing there.  Oh, my God.  That's the disaster.  Right there is the typical one you see on Cops.  She's probably only in her 40s.  She looks 60 and has no teeth.  Wow.  Looks like Joe Dirt's mother.  Yeah.  Nice mullet.  Big mullet.  Soccer mom-looking thing.  Would you do any of these?  No.  No.  There was one white chick back that was maybe a five.  Back up a few. 
[00:27:30]  Danny, where are you looking for this, too?  Trying to keep everyone involved today.  Just Google ugliest prostitutes.  Oh, really?  Nice.  Can you imagine being told you made that list?  Yeah.  Congrats.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Look at the brows on her.  That is horrendous.  That one might have youth on her side.  Oh, yeah.  There's a little youth going on there.  She's also got a shanker on her chin.  Yeah.  She probably fell on a curb, though.  A rough ball bag hit her. 
[00:28:00]  Someone with some stubble coming in.  I hit the bottom of her chin.  They must have been a couple of low-hangers.  Ugliest prostitutes.  Hey, you made it.  Did you get congratulated on that because you made a list?  Yeah.  Oh, 400.  Ugliest prostitute.  Yeah.  You made it.  Amazing.  That's wonderful.  Hey, 10 years ago today.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Columbine.  Uh-huh.  Is that amazing?  How was that 10 years ago?  Yeah.  I heard that on the news coming in.  And I was like, for some reason, that one didn't get me as much as some other things where  it's like, well, because that does kind of seem like a while ago.  Columbine seems like a while ago?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It kind of seems like a while ago.  I don't know.  Not for me.  It seems like yesterday.  Which means it's Hitler's birthday, right?  Yes, it is.  Happy birthday to you. 
[00:29:00]  Jesus.  Would have been 110 years young today, I believe.  Isn't this a bad day to go to school?  4-20.  4-20 is a bad day to do stuff, right?  It's also the smoke pot day.  Right.  4-20 day, man.  So you smoke some weed.  A lot of stuff about 4-20.  Yeah.  It's a big day for white supremacists and the sort.  I got, later on, Steve from Bayshore is coming over the house.  We're going to go down in the theater and watch some old World War II footage, followed by Downfall, the movie Downfall, about Hitler in the bunker and the last days of him, his staff, and Ava and Goldie. 
[00:29:30]  That's nice.  Celebrate.  Well, it's not much a celebration as a look back in history.  It would be very inappropriate, Jimmy, to celebrate a man's birthday like Adolf Hitler.  Did you call Carvel and try to get a cake with six million candles?  Creep. 
[00:30:00]  No.  It's a look back to put in perspective where we were and where we are.  A look back would be if you did it on April 28th.  If you do it on the day that Hitler was born, you are embracing, you're celebrating, you're blowing out candles like Jimmy.  No, there will be no cake.  You're doing party hats with a fucking cider.  I get cake.  I never get the cake.  That's why I do a piece of cake.  A look back would be if you did this any other day of the year. 
[00:30:30]  You had to plan ahead and go, ooh, his birthday's coming up.  What should we do this year?  You pick a day in history that is relevant to what you're going to be watching and experiencing and thinking about and pondering, things like that.  So this day was a day where it's like, okay, we need to remember history so we do not repeat history, Opie. 
[00:31:00]  So what I like to do is, no, that cake, Danny, will not be at my house.  It's a giant, there are three people carrying out a giant swastika cake back in the 30s, I believe.  Why don't they make that type of cake on those dumb cake shows?  Yeah, where do you go?  You see on the Food Network.  For that cake.  They should have, that's a cake show I would watch.  Outrageous cakes.  But they just make horrible, tasteless cakes.  Yeah, horrific, tasteless cakes.  About miscarriages and stuff, just need a lot of Cherry's Jubilee on top of it. 
[00:31:30]  Where are we at with our most offensive song thing?  Never shall we ever do it again, what?  Can we play the ones we used to play?  Where are we at with that?  Nine.  You don't think so?  Yeah, I don't think so.  How the hell did we ever get away with that?  I don't know, and that was on regular radio.  Regular radio.  Quite amazing, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, there's another birthday cake.  That looks a little more modern.  That one doesn't look like it was done in the 30s. 
[00:32:00]  I can't see it from here.  It was from a few years ago.  It says, happy 116th birthday, Adolf Hitler.  116th?  I thought it would only be 110.  Oh.  Looks like 116th to me.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it was 120.  I hear 120 years ago today.  All right, then it's 120.  It's a big one, Ian.  It would have been 120 if he was still living.  He's probably dead.  Yeah, he probably is.  Because you know he didn't live healthy.  No, no, he didn't.  Probably ate sauerkraut, didn't sleep properly. 
[00:32:30]  He was a vegetarian, by the way, Adolf Hitler.  A vegetarian.  Yeah.  I guess he lost his flavor from meat.  He saw what his military was doing.  I guess that blows Bernie Getz's theory out of the water that vegetarians are more docile  and less violent of a person.  Either that or how big a prick would he have been if he ate burgers?  I picked the wrong day.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, well, actually, Opie, April 28th would be a celebration, too. 
[00:33:00]  That's the anniversary of Hitler's marriage to Eva, two days before they killed themselves  in the bunker.  Ah, yes.  Here's to the happy couple.  It seems to just be April is a big Hitler month, I do believe.  Great.  And my birthday falls in there, too, in between all the shenanigans.  Your birthday is Sunday.  I'm in there.  Happy birthday.  Yeah.  Sunday.  Sundy.  Sundy.  Sundy, Sundy, Sundy.  Cool.  Yeah, I just, you know, I don't like doing much on that. 
[00:33:30]  On your birthday?  No, I'm not one of those, like, make a big deal out of it kind of a thing.  I like just hanging out.  Well, Sunday.  One hour.  Sunday is your low-key day, so it's perfect for you.  Hopefully it'll be nice.  I'm so sick of New York and Northeast weather.  I don't know about the rest of the country, but we got a nice day Saturday.  It was 80.  It was, like, 80 degrees.  I was able to go out back and just hang out.  It was so nice.  What, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  It was 80 degrees, and I checked my iPhone, and my girlfriend's like, how cold is it? 
[00:34:00]  I'm, like, 45.  And so we went out to get coffee, and she had on a sweater and her scarf and a jacket.  I got her so good.  What a great gag.  She was fuming.  You are a tool.  It's blazing hot out.  That's a perfect gag for New York City because, you know, we don't have the luxury of the suburbs  where you can kind of feel that it might be warm outside.  Yeah.  You're stuck in your glass box here, Manhattan.  You don't know if it's 80 or 30 outside. 
[00:34:30]  And if you're going down, like, 50 floors in an elevator, by the time you get outside,  you're not going to go back up again.  That's great.  What a good gag.  Rules.  You're a prick.  You're literally short.  People like kids on their bikes in short sleeves, and she has an ascot.  A scarf.  That's great.  It was a beautiful day, you know, one of those days where you could just hang out, out  back, drink, whatever.  Have a good time.  And then today, 45 is the high rain.  We are getting no spring right here. 
[00:35:00]  This is cutting into valuable, like, springtime.  We haven't had spring in years.  It goes from that weird winter to summer.  Dude, it's so much worse this year.  It really is worse because I remember at least it getting into mid-April, and you'd start feeling  maybe two days, three days in a row where it's nice out.  But now it's just, you know, it's coming up on, like, middle to the end of April, and  it's still shit out. 
[00:35:30]  April showers.  May flowers.  Yuck.  I add that to my list.  April showers.  They bring May flowers.  Aspiring actress.  And what is the other one?  Oh, yeah.  Water cooler talk.  Water cooler talk.  Is there a water cooler here?  I just want to go near it and start talking.  Holy crap.  Let's have Sam hang out by the water cooler all day.  And do water cooler talk.  What is that?  A real doll or something on the news?  I'm seeing there.  People are probably outraged that there's a semi-clad, big-titted mannequin. 
[00:36:00]  Those things are starting to look real.  And it's on the side of the road.  Can we find out what that story is about?  Yeah, I'm sure that story is interesting.  It looks like the famous real dolls you've heard about over the years.  And she's a buxom, like, blonde.  Yeah.  That's ridiculous, though.  And her bikini's on and her boobies are, like, you know, popping out all over the place.  Her perfect real doll boobies.  Would you bang one of those things? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, in a second.  I don't have to think about it.  I wasn't even going to say, like, oh, you would?  Yeah.  I was like, I'd be inside.  It would be so creepy.  You'd be balls deep in it.  And then when you come, you'd feel like an idiot.  What is that?  What happens to your brain after you shoot?  It's just like, it really is just an on-off switch.  It's like your brain yells, cut!  And you're back to normal.  And you're back to normal going, what kind of a creep am I?  Like, who is he?  And everything just gets awkward immediately. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, it really is something.  The real doll?  Yeah, his men real doll.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Just put that in your living room.  It's some male doll with his shirt off.  He's got his shorts on, pulled down a little, and this real doll dick sticking out.  And not an impressive one, I might add.  No, that's your average male real doll.  It's not really a male.  What?  Just throwing the question out there.  That's actually funny.  Would you fucking, like, would you fuck a real male doll? 
[00:37:30]  That's a good question.  Like, flip it over and do it in the ass?  Yeah, and kiss it.  Because it would feel no different than the female real doll.  Would that be considered gay?  Wow, we are all just silent here thinking about it.  Because you...  All right, there you go.  When you do that, there it is.  There is a male real doll.  That looks like your bathroom, by the way.  His name is Charlie.  Hey, wait a minute.  That is my bathroom.  Hey, that's not a real doll.  Hey, get off that picture. 
[00:38:00]  It's a real doll, and it's bent over the edge of the tub.  It's kneeling in the bathtub.  A little bubble bath thing going on.  There's a few soapy suds on his glistening back.  And it is in perfect position to get in the tub and rail in the hiney hole.  But, again...  The soapy.  Would you do that?  Because it is exactly the same material as the female real doll.  So is in real life. 
[00:38:30]  Yes, it is.  An asshole is an asshole.  Oh, God.  Jesus, Danny.  Ah, no, it's sitting on the edge of the tub with a close-up to its schween.  What the hell?  What the hell?  You would go?  No, no, no.  I'm saying, what the hell would you?  I don't know.  That's a little rough, to be honest with you.  It's all you've had, except your hand.  All right.  I don't mind.  You lost your arms in a horrible accident.  You can't jack off. 
[00:39:00]  It's all there is laying around the house is a male doll, a real doll.  Nice, slippery asshole available.  I'm not playing this game.  How long do you think I've been around, you idiot?  What?  You don't want to hear the, you homo, after he's answered yes?  We started this game together.  That would be a little rough.  That's a little rough, yeah.  I used to build women when I was like, you know, just starting off my jerking off. 
[00:39:30]  Grave robbing?  How did you build them?  You used pillows and stuff.  Oh, things like that?  Nah.  That's why doing a real doll of the female variety would be very easy.  You didn't build a woman when you were growing up, Morris?  No, I did not.  I never called it building a woman.  I just like finding shit to...  Hispanic, right?  I didn't mean shit to...  Yes.  That's why.  Exactly.  Hispanics.  Plantains.  Hispanics were thrown into that sex world nice and early.  Did you shower with dad?  I just stepped out of something that could have got me in trouble, see? 
[00:40:00]  I want people to know when I use my mental filter.  It's like instead of making a fake woman, building a woman, he would just...  Them.  You know.  Well, you can think of whatever word you want.  But it's a horrible, horrible depiction of Hispanic people that I did not want on the air.  All right. 
[00:40:30]  How much are they, Danny?  Some of these are fucking amazing.  Oh, yeah.  We've talked to this guy over the years.  I think they're pretty pricey.  I think they're like six grand or something like that.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Six grand to fuck something that doesn't change shape?  You make your money back in a few prostitution deals you might have done.  A few dates you might have gone on.  There's a she-mail option.  You just sit home alone.  A she-mail option?  Well, punch that up.  Yeah, $6,500 plus, I guess, shipping.  Would you do the she-mail real doll? 
[00:41:00]  No.  In a pinch.  Nah, it's rough.  Let's see.  What do they look like?  I guess they're just the female ones with a dick.  Yeah, with a cock on them.  All right.  Then you've got to do it in the ass, right?  You're not giving it a reach around.  It's a doll.  You don't have to make it feel good.  Trannies, she-mails, no way.  But it's not a tranny.  It's a female real doll with a plastic-  Because it comes out of this.  You could smell mail.  Yeah, but not on the real doll.  Oh, that's a good point. 
[00:41:30]  I'm talking about the real doll.  All right, now let's stick this over.  Not real in real life?  Screw that.  I'm talking-  No, screw that, but forget that.  The real doll is nothing but a female real doll with an appendage.  And I guess authentic anal features.  Now, you're not giving it a handy, because you don't have to make it feel good.  To me, I would equate that to a woman who likes just putting a strap-on on, but doesn't want to do you with the strap-on. 
[00:42:00]  And then you bang her in the ass while she's wearing a strap-on.  Would your girlfriend get mad, though?  Like, what is that?  All right, look, it does have plastic balls.  That's a real doll?  That's a real doll tranny?  No, no, no, that's a chick.  It looked like it had a-  Oh, it looked like balls.  So it doesn't have a cock.  That's a chick.  Oh, okay.  I had that all mixed up for all these years?  Jesus, I better switch back.  Ow.  How do you look at that?  I wonder if it's so hard to sit down every day.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  Look how they can pose them in all kinds of various real-life positions.  The problem is they don't have the eyes right yet.  No, that's kind of creepy looking at those lifeless dead eyes like a doll's eyes.  Because the eyes makes it look like you're banging a corpse.  Yeah.  The problem is where do you put them when company comes over?  Yeah, they're a little big to just kind of stash somewhere.  And if you want to show people your house, put it under your bed.  That's kind of creepy.  I imagine.  Can you pose them, Danny?  Yeah, I think they're fully poseable. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, you move them around.  I've seen documentaries where guys are obsessed with these things.  Yeah, I saw that one on HBO.  Real Sex.  Real Sex.  It's an old documentary, but it's so creepy.  Remember the couple that wanted to have the threesome?  So they got the real doll and brought it in the pool with them.  And it just looked so silly.  She's licking box on a fucking, you know.  I remember that.  It's like you might as well get the wax lips, turn them sideways and start licking them.  I think I also remember there was like an English documentary where this guy, like he didn't  have any money.  He was, there might have, I mean, obviously there was something a little wrong with him,  but like he spent all his money on real dolls and he had like four or five of them. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, and a bunch of them.  And he'd like, his day was spent with the dolls and he'd like pretend that they were his friends  and stuff.  Very, very strange.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes, stick to your guns, Opie.  Don't fuck anything with a dick.  Well, he makes a point, regardless of if it's a rubber one on a rubber doll or a real one.  All right.  Gordon from Jersey.  How shameful would it, would you feel cleaning your load out of its ass after you're done? 
[00:44:00]  See, that's just it.  That's the switch in your head.  You'd be all revved up and frothing and grunting as you're just pounding away.  And the second you shot your load and you know you got to clean it up, there it is,  just like this rubber man ass.  How do you clean it out, though?  Like, what do you do?  I don't know if a garden hose.  I don't know what you're going to do.  In the mouth and it comes out the toes.  Yeah.  I guess you got to get in there with some kind of cleaning solution. 
[00:44:30]  And by the way, I like the fact you asked the question before, like, if you had no arms,  would you, like, if you had no arms, like, that's your big dilemma.  I can't dial 911.  I can't eat.  But do I want to stick my dick in this male rubber doll?  I'm a fake man.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I had to put the scenario out there.  If you had no arms.  If you had no arms and no feet.  Like if you went to pick up important documents in Platoon.  This is important. 
[00:45:00]  Get me a male real doll.  How silly would you feel trying to nudge it over on its stomach, its heart on, is keeping  it pressed up?  It's tipping over.  Dick falls out.  The Asian one, they bring an extra penis.  It comes in a mask box.  We got one story to do here.  On the phones, we got Ray in Philly.  Hello.  I'll be an Anthony's show.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Ray. 
[00:45:30]  My aunt was in a mall.  Oh, you can call me Ray.  You can call me Jay.  You can call me Ray J. Johnny.  But you doesn't have to call me Johnson.  That should have been killed years ago.  You didn't like that bit?  Oh, that bit was horrid.  It was all right.  Ray J. Johnson.  Every time you called him Ray, you would just jump.  Oh, you can call me.  We got it.  Well, what?  Mr. Johnson.  You doesn't have to call me Mr. Johnson.  You can call me Ray. 
[00:46:00]  Or you can call me.  Yes, we get it.  Can we try to figure out the worst comedy sketch ever?  That's it.  Not comedy sketch.  The worst stand-up comedy bit ever.  Like the one aunt just described, the Ray is right up there.  Horrific.  See, the only problem is we probably don't know it because it's probably so bad it never got famous.  No, it's one of those that is over-the-top famous for...  Jiffy Jeff's gym.  That's a Nelson bit.  I'm familiar with the character.  I don't know the bit.  Maybe we'll try to figure that out.  What the fuck are we looking at?  Is that a video of a man actually having sex with a real doll? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, he's face-fucking a real doll.  Let me see it, Dan.  Try a little bit.  He's face-fucking it.  What the fuck?  No money shot?  Why?  Where's this, Dan?  This is a website called realdollsex.com.  Why does he keep the shirt on it?  Yeah, right?  He's trying to be sexy.  How do you keep a rod for a real doll?  I guess friction.  There's the money shot you wanted.  Oh, there's the money shot all over the cans. 
[00:47:00]  All over the big plastic boobies.  See, now he's got to wipe it off.  That's called being in a hurry and not wanting to get in there with the fucking...  He doesn't want to wrap toilet paper around his finger and scoop it in.  And start wiping out, hoping he got it all.  Because you don't clean them out.  You got a bunch of potato flakes.  You got potato flakes on the real doll.  The real doll's got danger from between...  These fuckers are funny this morning, especially.  Hold on, Ray.  Blue Heeler in Kentucky writes,  horrify the neighbors.  Hose off your real doll on the front lawn. 
[00:47:30]  That's funny.  That is good.  What are you doing, Bob?  I'm just cleaning my cum out of this rubber doll.  Can I borrow your hose?  That's funny.  People say, worst comedy bit ever.  Kevin Meaney's We Are the World.  You know what, though?  That was relevant when it came out.  It was kind of funny because he would, you know...  It was good when he first started doing it.  He first started.  You see it now.  We didn't need to hear it 20 years later.  Oof.  Hey, Ray, go ahead.  Finally.  Sorry.  Sorry, Ray. 
[00:48:00]  Hey.  So, my aunt was sitting in a mall, I guess it was a couple months ago,  and she saw some guy standing in the front of the mall where the mannequins are.  He's groping and humping the back of the mannequin in front of all the people in the mall.  I guess he had Down syndrome or something.  He's sitting there going to town on this thing.  Yeah, they'll jerk off at the drop of a hat.  They really will.  Literally.  A big, giant hat.  A hat with a propeller on it. 
[00:48:30]  Some of those mannequins, though, growing up, you would kind of look at them a little odd when you were a kid.  Do you get sort of turned on when you see some of those mannequins without the clothes on?  When they first came out with the nipple ones.  No, the newer ones are, there's something going on there.  But as a kid, that's when they first came out with, like, using the nips,  and they'd have, like, very loose-fitting clothes,  but it would be just gently brushing the mannequin nipple,  and they were able to pose them differently.  Because at first, they were just creepy old-looking mannequins,  like at the nuclear test sites in Nevada, 
[00:49:00]  the ones that occupy the house that's going to blow up.  Crash test.  Yeah, yeah, crash test fucking dummies.  But you kind of started looking at them and going like,  ooh, it's kind of nice.  Not too shabby.  You combine the real doll with robotic technology,  as the Japanese are coming out, let's say within 50 years,  there will be absolutely realistic,  where you can program, say, 50 personalities into it,  and it won't be able to walk and talk, per se. 
[00:49:30]  Punching cunt.  Just not give you any sex and just be a bitch.  Just roll over.  But I guarantee you that there's realistic fuck dolls  within X amount of time,  and then the moral things will come up.  How old should you make them?  Can you make them as kids?  Can you hurt them?  All this weird shit's going to crop up.  I have heard about that, too,  about the controversy of real dolls being made into,  obviously, too young of a form, 
[00:50:00]  and whether that's some kind of a moral dilemma.  Well, who makes them?  You've got to think,  who's the guy that goes to the factory and makes that mold?  That's got to be a business that's probably targeted.  Yeah, they showed it in the documentary.  They showed how they were made and everything.  It's a fuckload of latex, man.  Yeah.  You have a latex allergy,  just coming to work the next day covered in hives.  Yeah.  Dick is falling off.  Can we take a break?  Because Sam went to the Chiller Theater.  Oh, did he? 
[00:50:30]  That was going on?  He interviewed our old pal, Iron Sheik.  The Iron Sheik.  So we got a couple minutes of audio from the Iron Sheik.  Fantastic.  Also, Chris in Auburn,  he's given us a heads up this morning.  He says,  you have to get some audio of Ralph Kiner from the Mets games.  Kiner's cornered.  Unbelievable.  He's not alive?  Kiner.  If you guys could get a couple clips from Ralph Kiner this year,  that'd be good.  It's a new show called Kiner's Coroner.  It's going to be...  No?  That was kind of funny.  He's getting old and he'll be dead soon. 
[00:51:00]  He got a double, Sam.  Position time says nine.  We've got to acknowledge that Harry Callis died.  Yes.  And I was down in Philly,  and it's all about Harry Callis.  Speaking of Callis,  now, Charlie Callis had a horrible bit, too.  That was the comedian that went...  What was his bit?  He would just talk and go like...  I did a movie with him,  and he was a very famous guy.  Hammer, hammer, hammer.  I don't know what he does.  He would make stupid faces and sounds. 
[00:51:30]  Look, Kenny's laughing.  Kenny looked like he was probably a Charlie Callis fan.  Who wasn't back in the town?  Who wasn't?  Everyone.  But he was always on these variety shows.  Him and the Ray J. Johnson guy,  they were always on these Dean Martin variety shows  and Bob Hope.  Hey, hey, we got Ray J. Johnson coming out with Cheryl.  Oof.  Would he come out and just do his bit?  Oh, of course.  Hey, Charlie Callis is coming out in a little while.  I need to see Charlie Callis now. 
[00:52:00]  Was it a funny bit?  No!  Stunk!  It's terrible.  Where's Charlie Callis?  That guy's fucking at Real Dahl Well.  Oh, yeah.  He's deep-dicking that fucking rubber woman.  Just like every woman I ever fuck.  She's just not moving, waiting for it to be over.  That is some weird shit.  How do these guys keep rods?  I could never keep a rod.  You know what it is?  It looks like it's very lubed. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  I mean, he's not having any resistance problems.  So it's probably just the physical sensation that this guy's into.  No emotional attachment there.  He's spanking.  He's spanking it, which is silly.  Well, we'll watch this guy fuck the Real Dahl.  We're going to take a break.  We've got to get Charlie Callis his picture up so we know who you're talking about.  You know what he should do?  He should spray that fucking shit spray in its asshole.  So at least he gets a realistic scent. 
[00:53:00]  Put sushi in the vagina?  Put some fucking tuna roll in there.  Oh, God damn.  All right.  That is weird.  Fantastic.  That's weird.  Weird stuff.  He's lubing up his...  He has the money shot.  Nah, there's still more video.  Oh, is there?  Oh, no.  He's just lubed it up and now he's going back in.  Where's...  I want to see Charlie Callis. 
[00:53:30]  We'll do that after the break.  How's that?  Charlie Callis stinks.  Hit me with a break.  We'll continue Opie and Anthony and a little Jimmy Norton. </pre>
