<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion sparked by a Buffalo, NY newspaper's description of their show as "the most offensive show in local radio history."  The hosts found this amusing, contrasting their programming with the seemingly inoffensive contests (a high school spirit contest and a coin-collecting contest, the latter's proceeds going to charity, according to a former employee caller) of a local KISS-branded station.  This led to tangents on the perceived lack of adult humor, the hosts' own perceived arrested development, a high school peephole incident, the woes of gym teachers, tedious radio promotions (including anecdotes about delivering subs and handing out roses), a recurring "6 o'clock queef" bit (with a new jingle introduced later), and listener calls describing various suggestive radio contests ("hide the salami," "what am I").  A caller offered a bribe for music, and the conversation ended with a discussion of "pickle punks" (deformed fetuses) and a Philadelphia museum housing them.  Throughout this segment, Ozzy Osbourne's pre-recorded promotional announcements repeatedly interrupted.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a purported Christina Aguilera sex tape, analyzing provided still images and a video clip.  Angie from Cleveland called in for help with a Grand Theft Auto 3 mission.  The hosts continued their feud with the producer of the Ron and Fez show, centering on a broken foosball table and a new Rolling Stones pinball machine.  The "Unlucky Lottery" segment highlighted improbable misfortunes, including a tree-related death and a jet-ski accident involving a duck.  Several poorly-made songs, particularly those dedicated to the New York Jets, were played.  Callers contributed to the discussion, with Brian providing a link to the alleged Aguilera tape, another sharing a colon specimen anecdote, and Steve submitting a picture of his taint for an age-guessing game. Professional wrestler Jim Brewer also called in.

The next segment featured a call from Triple H promoting his appearances on *Raw* and *SmackDown*.  Jim Brewer was in the studio.  Further calls came from Murphy, Gary (who discussed his 12-year-old girlfriend, resulting in a heated exchange with Anthony), and a heavily intoxicated Lady Di (whose past incidents on the show were recounted). New segments were introduced: "Dashboard DJ," "Miscarriage Monday," and "Celebrity Decapitations."  An attempt at Ozzy Osbourne's helicopter traffic report was made, and the "6 o'clock queef" segment featured a caller, Polly, making queefing sounds on air. A listener joke segment ("Stump the Joke") was included, along with news about Nick Carter's arrest.  Jim Brewer detailed his snowboarding accident, which resulted in a tailbone injury and soiling himself. Major Hips called to describe his plan to gift a Kiss fan.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Brewer's eyesight and suggestions for future segments from a caller named Adam.

A later segment revisited Jim Brewer, who graphically recounted his skiing accident and resulting broken coccyx, using vulgar language.  This was contrasted with Triple H's more serious quadriceps injury.  The conversation became sexually suggestive and offensive, incorporating homophobic and misogynistic slurs.  Listeners contributed their own "what I learned today" stories, often containing vulgar and offensive content. Brewer promoted an upcoming performance. The segment ended with a frantic search for Opie's missing parking ticket, accompanied by playful insults and accusations between the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And I'll see you at the 9th...  I forgot what year I was in there.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and I'll see you at...  Oh, I suppose she's going to be crazy.  Should I just say my name?  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  I don't have to know.  She's going to answer something.  W...  W-4.  Oh, f***ing nuts this morning.  Get me a f***ing book to read.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to...  What's that?  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  It'll be Opie and Anthony on the rock stage. 
[00:00:30]  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  I can't believe we're looking for a new senator. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, not that dog.  Oh, what?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  In the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Right.  Anywhere else, including...  Huh?  Got to give it to him again.  Buffalo, New York.  Two days in a row.  Oh, 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:02:00]  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Why does Buffalo deserve that honor?  Well, we just got the biggest compliment in the Buffalo newspaper today.  We did, did we?  Or a couple days ago, I believe.  All right.  They did a little year-in-review about the radio in Buffalo, New York.  Don't you love the year-in-reviews?  Well, there's not enough of those.  Top Honors went to the KISS station of Buffalo. 
[00:02:30]  There's one of those up there, too.  There's a KISS station in every city in America.  That makes your radio station special.  KISS.  When you're called K-Rock or KISS.  Isn't there a KISS here in New York?  Yes, there is a KISS here in New York.  Isn't the chef the morning guy?  Did they get rid of him finally?  Tom Joyner?  Oh, Joyner?  What happened to me?  No, he sits in and kind of babysits.  Join me every morning.  We'll be announcing happy birthdays.  He does that.  I swear. 
[00:03:00]  He does the fun happy birthday bit, huh?  Happy birthday.  And you could win a computer.  That's what he said.  I swear.  Well, Top Honors went to KISS in Buffalo.  Uh-huh.  As far as this tool, as he did his year in review, Anthony Violante.  Ah.  Anthony Violante.  When you're reporting the year in review, shouldn't it just be a report and not really editorializing?  I don't give a...  You're going to love what he said about our show.  I know.  But Top Honors went to KISS because they did something called the Annual High School Spirit Contest. 
[00:03:30]  Annual High School Spirit Contest.  Spirit Contest.  Yeah.  Who's got that school spirit?  Maybe someone in Buffalo can explain what that was all about.  And then, uh, except for a controversial X-rated song by Apple Man at the KISSmas Bash, before an all-ages crowd, everything about 2001 was just about perfect.  Let me tell you something.  For KISS and their program director.  Can I add something right now?  Yeah.  I could tell by that, this guy really enjoys our program. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, he hates us.  If he doesn't like the little risque song by Afro Man.  Right.  That ruined the perfect score that KISS would have had.  Uh, three years ago, they started the High School Spirit Contest.  High School Spirit?  What is the High School Spirit Contest?  I don't know.  I think we have a lot of fun.  We've got spirit.  Yes, we do.  We've got spirit.  How about you?  Yeah!  Yeah!  You know, it's not easy to get up here.  Fast High, there is one high.  Right?  Always funny. 
[00:04:30]  And we're going to kill Lincoln, right?  Right?  Right?  Okay, look.  It's not easy being spirit bunnies.  You want to know?  You know, Tina and me.  You want to know a little known fact about that movie?  Oh, hi.  And that scene?  Right.  The other cheerleader that doesn't say anything?  Yeah.  Bruce Springsteen's sister.  Really?  Yep.  How about that?  Those DVDs come in handy when you listen to the director talk through the whole movie.  A little Fast Times trivia.  And then it just goes on to talk about all the other fun radio stations, Anthony. 
[00:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Wow, it's all about KISS and their KISSmas bash.  KISSmas bash.  I want it, Anthony.  I guess we made such an impact, they had to add us in.  Who is this guy's name?  Anthony Violante.  So it finally gets to us at the end of his little year on the deal.  Talking about the radio station we're on in Buffalo, WBUF, Anthony.  Yeah.  BUF turned to raunchy programming.  Raunchy.  And it's battle for listeners with classic rocker 97 Rock.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:05:30]  And it says, uh, Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony took over afternoons with what may be the most  offensive show in local radio history.  Whoa!  Yeah!  Thank you.  What may be the most offensive show in local radio history.  History.  This is the second signal.  That's a winner.  That's right.  Came out of the radio.  In radio history. 
[00:06:00]  Radio history.  God, that's great.  Yes.  There you have it.  Thank you.  Thank you for that compliment.  Boy.  Gee, you must be a real...  God, loosen up, man.  Can we have promos made?  I want a promo.  I hope so.  Boy, they ought to run with that.  We'll listen to Opie and Anthony.  The most offensive show in local radio history.  There you go.  We need one of those immediately.  What happened to that guy?  Let me see his picture.  That is his picture?  Because he's got his picture on there.  No.  Oh, that's not him.  That's the PD of the Kiss Nation.  I should have known. 
[00:06:30]  He's got a PD.  Look.  Oh.  Hello.  Yeah.  Well, this guy, is he old?  Does anyone know about this guy?  The reporter?  Yeah.  Because most guys that write about radio are just geeks.  Yeah, but you know...  They never get it right.  They don't...  They don't...  They never write about what's...  About the interesting things going on in radio in your city.  It's always about how the local jazz station is doing this.  And this station is still, you know, hanging on to their roots and playing all the crappy 
[00:07:00]  rock that we've been listening to for the last 25 years.  And the little holiday things that no one cares about.  Right.  Guys, at some point, lose it.  If a guy like Anthony Violante likes our radio show, you know we're doomed.  Yeah.  So we know we're on the right track.  I know.  When someone says that Shock Shock's Opie and Anthony took over afternoons with what may  be the most offensive show in local radio history...  I love that.  We're on the right track, my friend.  You haven't noticed that, though? 
[00:07:30]  Guys lose it after a certain time in life.  Like, people goof on us sometimes.  Oh, I know that.  That we are pretty much in a state of arrested development.  I don't know how it happened, but, you know, I kind of enjoy it.  I like being able to laugh at stuff that the same fifth graders laugh at.  You know what I mean?  And at some point, some of these guys, you know they enjoyed stuff when they were younger.  You know they were able to have a good time.  And then, I don't know, maybe they got married and had kids or something and feel this responsibility 
[00:08:00]  to the world, and they just lose their sense of humor.  You know what I mean?  You don't have to think everything we do on the show is funny, that's for sure.  I sure don't.  But we fake it pretty well.  Yeah.  But it's like, to then get so upset about people having a good time and enjoying themselves  and knowing that other people out there listening are having a good time and enjoying themselves, 
[00:08:30]  and then to get so upset that you've got to, like, get mad that they're having fun and maybe  you're not, I think that has more to do with it than you're so offended by it.  Somewhere along the line, you lost it and you turned into your dad.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Yes.  That's right, Butters.  Was that funny or are we faking it?  I kind of like that.  I was kind of cute.  Butters.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Well, we've got a couple people from Buffalo.  They're going to tell us what the high school spirit contest was all about.  Eric?  All right.  All right. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  What's up, Eric?  Yeah, I'll tell you.  That high school spirit contest, KISS is one of those music stations that plays, you  know, Britney and Pink.  Well, Eric, you don't even have to explain what KISS plays because there's a KISS station  in every city in America.  And they play the same thing.  You're not going to get the, you know, the hard rock station isn't going to be a KISS  station, right?  Yeah, I guess you're right.  All right.  So that's going to be your K-Rock.  I'm sorry.  They would go to different schools, okay?  There would be a basketball game going on. 
[00:09:30]  And whoever would call in the most and have the biggest school spirit, you know, just  give them people to call.  That's pretty much all it was.  Oh, my God.  And that's why I guess they were so good.  But I've got to give you guys something.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  When you, uh...  Thank God this guy hates us.  When you come out of Buffalo.  We don't want to be lumped in with a radio station that does high school spirit contest.  Yeah, I mean, KISS is just one of those, uh, they've got a big billboard, uh, 
[00:10:00]  and what do they do?  Black America and all that stuff.  Do they, like, at least try to throw a little party for the high school?  Because that's what some of the stations do.  Yeah, that's what they did, too.  And they get some lame local band that stinks?  Or do they get real bands?  They'll get, uh, a local...  They'll get, uh, Backstreet Boys when they come through.  Or the winner.  Hi, KISS!  Hi, KISS!  We have spirit art school on spirit!  Can we leave you to spirit school?  All right!  All right!  And we're going to kill Lincoln!  All right!  You know, guys, I really got to give you props, though. 
[00:10:30]  I mean, I'll tell you, there is nothing in Buffalo until you guys have come along.  Well, it's kind of obvious with the ratings, so thank you.  Kind of a backhanded compliment, isn't it?  Oh, it's all right.  We rule in a pool of nothing.  Right.  Well, hey, there was a morning show, and I'm sure Oak knows about, because he used to  work for the Fox, and you might know who I'm talking about, but you guys blow them out  of the water.  I'll tell you, Louis Black used to go on their show.  Don't hear him anymore.  He's always on your show. 
[00:11:00]  But was that the Spuds Buckley, or was that when you were in Rochester?  I get that confused all the time.  I did a little Spuds Buckley when I was in Buffalo.  Was there a little Buffalo Spuds Buckley?  Norton's face, like, just smelled a bad fart.  Ah!  Spuds Buckley.  Norton, this is your first radio job, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Why don't you just be quiet?  Since reporters like that, what happened was this guy, when he would have thought the  show was funny, was when he had dreams of, like, breaking deep throat at Watergate or 
[00:11:30]  doing something like that, and instead, look where he is with his fat wife.  Shoveling seven feet of snow, and he is mad that anybody else is enjoying life.  I will bet money that most of the guys that write for radio or run message boards wanted  to be in the business so bad and failed miserably, and this is what they're left with, writing  about it.  You wouldn't tell them.  Kind of like high school coaches.  They wanted to play professional sports.  That was their dream.  Absolutely.  They failed miserably, so they're stuck teaching it. 
[00:12:00]  Not teaching it.  They're stuck, especially gym teachers, taking out all of their aggravation of where their  life has led them.  You know a gym teacher had dreams of football or baseball or something, and he ended up being  a goddamn gym teacher watching a bunch of kids, and they are always so angry.  I had the guy in John Glenn High School.  It was Gil Lilienthal was his name. 
[00:12:30]  Big, fat tub of crap.  And this guy played for the Denver Broncos for a very short time until his knee blew out.  And then all of a sudden, all right, your knee blew out.  Your sports career is over.  Here, take care of these kids now.  You wanted to be a football star, but now you're going to be a wet nurse in these children.  And he would smack the kids around, make them run until they drop.  Just a miserable, miserable man.  You got to love that, though. 
[00:13:00]  Good for him.  You know something, looking back, I'm like, good, you know, for all the crap that he gave  me and everybody else in our class, I look back now and realize, oh, my God, he was 20  billion times more miserable than he made any of us.  Yeah, he was always over talking to the girls.  Whenever that big partition in the gym would open, the big accordion doors that would stop  your pants from popping out in front of you, you'd see the girls in gym class.  You'd get all hot.  You're running through that period of time where your hormones are pumping. 
[00:13:30]  Dude, and then they shut the boner door.  Dude, we had the greatest scam going on at Harborfields High School.  This goes way back, so I think I'm safe.  We discovered in the coach's office a peephole right into the...  Was it like Porky's?  Were you like Porky's?  The peephole was up high.  And it showed the ladies' locker room. 
[00:14:00]  Really?  So I saw every girl I went to high school naked.  That's goddamn beautiful.  Naked.  Swear.  Every single one of you.  That's beautiful.  I will start naming names.  They all listened to this show.  I saw you all naked when you were 16 and 17 and 18 years old.  It was so hot.  We would close the coach's office door.  It was behind a cork board.  And there it was.  Isn't it a shame it was before really camcorders became popular and everyone had one? 
[00:14:30]  God, because you'd have video documentation.  Probably be a few arrests.  It was the greatest thing of my life.  There was another gym teacher at Coach Cirillo.  He was another one of our gym teachers at John Glenn.  And he would spend more time on the other side of that accordion door with the girls.  And the girls loved this guy.  You know, and they're little, supple little 16-year-old girls.  They're buds.  And he's chatting with them and everything. 
[00:15:00]  They're nice buds.  Yeah, hey, hey, you know, you know, I got into this a few years ago.  Keep running!  Keep running!  Yeah, oh, no, no, no problem.  And then we got the dyke gym teacher, the woman.  Oh, with the mullet head.  We got a gym teacher that wants to defend himself.  All right.  Rick.  Yes.  You want to defend yourself and other gym teachers?  Really, what I want to say is, I'm a gym teacher in New York City.  And most of my friends are jealous of me because of the job I have. 
[00:15:30]  And why is that, sir?  I have summers, holidays, weekends off.  And I got to tell you, I just pulled up to my apartment.  And what time is it?  3.15.  3.15.  You know something?  You are absolutely right.  I'll give you that.  And you get to look at all those young, supple...  Oh, sorry.  Boys.  Well, I do have to...  Hey, dude, what did you want to do with your life before you became a gym teacher?  Oh, I got to tell you, I started out in an accounting major.  Mm-hmm.  And then I went to business. 
[00:16:00]  I mean, did you want to be in sports?  Oh, we all did as little kids.  Come on.  You know you were a little kid dreaming of being in the big leagues?  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  Did you get even remotely close in college or anything?  No, I played baseball up until the age of 19, and then I played rugby in college.  Rugby.  Translation?  Yeah.  Boring.  I just want to know if he got close and then had to be a gym teacher.  Well, being a gym teacher is one of those fallback careers.  Yes.  No one dreams of being a gym teacher.  I'm going to be a gym teacher.  You dream about being a cop, a fireman, you know, a professional athlete. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  Radio DJ.  Not a gym teacher.  Actually, radio is a fallback career, too.  All right.  Thank you, Rick.  All right.  Thanks.  I don't mind teaching gym.  Gym teachers, the fallback career, if you were trying to get into sports and you got injured.  Radio, the fallback career, if you were too stoned or drunk to have any other career pan out,  you end up here on our forum.  You know, darn it, they hung up. 
[00:17:00]  Who?  This station at Buffalo Kiss, they also do a coin collecting contest.  No, they don't.  Oh, my God.  Not only is coin collecting probably the most boring hobby, but there's a contest involving  it.  I don't know what it is.  What?  Whatever school collects the most change gets a free concert or something?  Is that what they're getting at?  Maybe they go with a year.  Maybe it's a date on the...  Here's Kelly.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yes, we actually did do that.  I used to work for Kiss. 
[00:17:30]  I don't work there no more.  Were you on the air?  No, I was not.  I worked in the accounting department.  Ah, okay.  And we're the ones that had to count all the damn change that they would collect from these  high schools.  And what was done with the change?  Charity, right?  Kelly.  Was it charity?  Yes.  The change went to like the hospice.  Charity.  No, Kelly.  Yeah.  So how did the contest go?  All the high schools would collect their change and the one that had the most change  got what?  They got a free concert by like Kiss 90 or by 98 Degrees. 
[00:18:00]  Oh!  All right!  And we're going to collect the most change.  All right!  And they could only collect pennies.  Only pennies.  Oh, that makes it harder.  And then the year before that, it was whoever sent in the most three-by-five index cards.  More boring radio going on out there.  Three-by-five index cards.  I love when people report the bad radio to us.  I really, really enjoy it.  It's so much fun to hear that it's actually going on. 
[00:18:30]  It's worse than anything we could ever dream up.  Right.  Is the reality of some of these radio promotions.  Okay.  Thank you, Kelly.  Thanks, guys.  All right, bye.  I know.  I like Kelly there calling up with that.  That's great.  Yeah.  You know, I got to call out my old radio station, the AB on Long Island.  Yeah.  They're doing a New Year's resolution weekend.  New Year's resolution.  You would have been part of this.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Well, you know, from a guy that took heroes to the workplace hero of the day, I guess that wouldn't be it. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, who did that?  I had to take five-foot heroes to the work.  You had to go and bring a hoagie?  No, Norton, get this.  When I first hooked up with Oprah.  Wait, can I explain?  I just want to do this real quick.  But this is why I do what I do today with you and our friend Norton here.  Right.  You were able to move on and realize, all right.  Because I finally had it.  And now I want to expose all this crap to everybody.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I hung out at gas stations while people pumped their goddamn dollar two gas. 
[00:19:30]  I did the five-foot hero at the world.  I used to bring mugs to workplaces.  When I first, like, hooked up at OPI at BAB.  I'll show the picture if you're not nice.  No, that's fine.  I'm just, this is reality.  All right.  And look at what I was doing.  I was in my work van when I showed up, so.  Hey, you thought it was cool when we hung out at that mobile gas station.  That's what I was talking about.  While I handed out roses for Valentine's Day.  I pull up, goes, yeah, meet me. 
[00:20:00]  I'm going to be down at this gas station.  And he's doing, like, phoners.  It's great.  Hey, it's OPI.  I'm here at the mobile gas station on the old country road here in Hicksville.  And we're giving roses out to the ladies for Valentine's Day.  That was about it, man.  About it.  So, come on by.  Come on by.  We may have some ice scrapers still available.  Ice scrapers to give you.  And we're giving away free windshield washer fluid. 
[00:20:30]  So, it's OPI, mobile gas station.  I did it all.  That's why I like exposing it now, man.  I will write a book someday.  And I are writing a book together, and I'm going to write another book.  Man.  So, where were we at?  Oh, the five, uh, yeah, the five-foot hero.  Yeah, the hero.  Yeah, yeah.  Because the workplace hero of the day.  Of the day.  So, he would bring the big hero.  For the hero.  OPI would have to bring the hero.  Yeah.  Did anyone, bitch?  You forgot the mustard.  Shut up, you fat C. 
[00:21:00]  So, they're doing a New Year's resolution weekend.  I'll give them a quick plug.  All right.  And what does that involve?  I still hang out on Long Island.  It's my Long Island radio station.  Hey, look at that.  All weekend long, you get a chance to win, like, New Year's resolution things.  What would that be?  Non-alcoholic beer, because a lot of people are going to drink less.  I'm not drinking this year.  Uh, they're, they're, uh, gonna give, uh, in the same price pack, uh, let's see, the non-alcoholic beer.  The, uh, nicotine patches, because a lot of people are going to quit smoking. 
[00:21:30]  Very big resolution, the quit smoking.  Uh, uh, I'm trying to remember all the stuff.  Uh, uh, rice cakes.  Rice cakes.  Well, you know.  Oh, the diet.  The diet thing.  All right.  And, uh, calling cards, because we all said we'd call our mom more this year.  Wow. 
[00:22:00]  Sorry.  Uh, Al, what's going on?  Oh, man.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  Hey, New Haven, Connecticut, they have this thing called hide the salami, I heard before.  They, uh, I guess they hide a salami at a location, and the listeners call in and, uh, like, they guess where it is.  Where's the salami hidden?  Right.  They, like, narrow it down, like, you know, they'll say, oh, it's north of the river, east of here, you know.  Oh.  And what do you get, one guess?  Yeah, one guess.  And if, you know, if you can't, if you can't narrow it down, and you're out, and then the next guy calls and picks it up. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, so, so, so, if you're right, you get to guess again.  Oh, there you go.  Up until you're, up until you're wrong.  You got it.  Is it east of the river?  You're like, yeah, okay, is it north of, yeah, all right, uh, is it, uh, this street corner?  Eh, no, I'm sorry, but if you listen closely to everybody that calls in, you're going to narrow it down.  I think you win tickets to some washed-up country rock band or something.  I think that's called a, uh, a TSL contest, by the way.  Oh, is it? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, a time-spent listening contest.  It makes people listen longer.  Linger longer.  You linger longer because you get, you get.  Yeah, Ron, you guys suck.  You get the, you get the clues from the guy before you, and then, oh, I write them down,  and, oh, now I got my chance here, you know, it's a TSL contest, yeah.  And, oh, no, Opie didn't do the Friday morning crank call, and I did not do the Q and the D.  That's Bob.  The Q and the D.  What am I?  Q and the D.  Boy, I thought it was.  No, wait a minute. 
[00:23:30]  You can't say that.  I never heard that in the morning.  It's the, what am I contest.  What am I?  Yeah, you know, I'm, I'm firm yet soft.  I'm firm yet heavy yet light.  Right.  I'm big yet small.  I'm light yet dark.  What am I?  Call up as the trick Q and the D.  And you, and, and one of the clues was like, yeah, you know, and you can put me in your 
[00:24:00]  mouth.  Right.  It's a big heart.  Well, you said that already.  Right.  But it's a toothbrush.  It's a toothbrush.  See, they tricked you because it's the trick Q of the D.  He's so inside, Rick.  You ass.  Inside is fun, though.  Yeah.  Oh, gee.  Yeah.  A little lutz.  Wow.  Yeah, that is funny.  Wow.  Paulie, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Wanted to congratulate you on your first day back yesterday.  It was beautiful from three to seven. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Let's just put it this way.  If you're going to be interviewed on TV, you might want to turn the other way.  Okay.  Jesus.  Okay.  Ouch.  Paulie, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Just wanted to congratulate you on your first day back yesterday.  Oh, why?  We made it the...  It was the golden nugget from three to seven.  The whole thing.  Ah, look at that.  Well, it's part of our new format where we do more things on our show.  Hey, format.  We don't need no stinking format. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, that's our quote.  New format and less commercials.  Yes.  Less commercials and more good.  I did notice that the commercials were slightly shorter, yes.  We play the most variety of bits on our radio show.  The most variety.  Yeah, I just wanted to congratulate you guys, man.  You guys rock.  Norton rules and stinky rules.  We play the greatest bits from the 70s, 80s, and 90s, Anthony.  All your favorite bits.  All your favorite bits from the 80s, 90s, and today.  Of course you're playing the best records from the 80s, 90s, and today. 
[00:25:30]  All the best.  What station would purposely try to play the worst songs of the 90s and today?  Which cities out there that we're in have the Terry Garr commercial?  Like the Light FM here in New York?  They're the station that's on in every department store, every deli.  It's the safe station, and here there's a DJ that works there.  Valerie, right?  And she's sitting at the board. 
[00:26:00]  Here's the commercial.  Terry Garr is sitting in with her for some reason.  I have no idea what it is.  Well, because it's so hard to push the buttons.  Yeah.  Terry tells you which button to push next.  You need Terry Garr, the definition of long in the tooth.  You see that episode of Star Trek that she was in many years ago?  She's walking around in a little mini skirt and stuff, really hot.  Now it's like, oh my God, what happened?  But she's sitting there at the board with Valerie.  Valerie doesn't say a word.  She looks at Terry, smiles, and presses a button and goes into the song. 
[00:26:30]  And Terry Garr goes, less talk, or no talk, all music.  Like saying, hey, Valerie, a monkey can do your job.  It's the Terry Garr commercials.  But I'm sure every city has that station where Terry's doing the commercials.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break.  So there you go.  Two days in a row, Buffalo gets the acknowledgement at the beginning of the show.  Kote out.  All right. 
[00:27:00]  Anthony, we have to take a break.  We've got to do the virginity thing that I was talking about yesterday.  Uh-huh.  And you see that wall of carts over there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stinky and I were going through it before the show.  Blew the dust off of some of them?  Some of these carts haven't been played in two or three years now.  Wow.  And we're trying to, like, you know, clean up the show.  Uh-huh.  Out with the old, in with the new type thing.  Sure.  Right, Jim?  Yeah.  The old, was that your resolution? 
[00:27:30]  Just cleaning up.  Okay.  Goes along with the new format and the less commercials.  More cleaner, more gooder?  Yeah, doing a little early spring cleanup.  House cleaning.  House cleaning.  So some of those carts in that huge rack of carts over there, very old.  And very embarrassing.  Because now if we play some of this stuff out of context, it's going to make us look like complete tools.  Uh-huh.  Like there are bad Jets songs up there.  That I remember.  There's like a Vinny and the Jets song up there. 
[00:28:00]  You know what?  I remember three years ago or so, when Gary Wall was our PD here.  Oh, geez.  The dark years, we call them.  And he insisted that someone make a Jets song.  The Jets are big.  They're big.  This is, you know, the Jets year.  We need a Jets song.  So he made the production guy do a Jets song.  And it's awful.  I remember we played it and told everyone how awful it was. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, my God.  To defend ourselves.  Yeah.  So we're going to just grab the carts from the wall and play some of them.  They're really bad.  I'm warning you now.  Good.  It shouldn't make for some embarrassing cringe radio, okay?  We're going to do that today and other things.  Oh, yeah.  The 6 o'clock queef is coming up today.  Do we have our little theme song?  Yeah.  You thought we were kidding.  It's our new bit.  Yeah.  We like this bit.  Check this out.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart. 
[00:29:00]  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart.  But smells like fish at 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  Yeah.  There's the intro for the new bit.  See, we're working hard on our radio show in the new year.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just want to know if you realize that you're getting an endless amount of material from one call from one guy who didn't like the format of the show. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  And we like when you guys report the really bad radio out there.  Yeah, but he's happy about that call.  We can't keep track of all the cities, so you guys got to help us.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jesse.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, the guy's on the line, I think.  Tom.  Yeah.  You're the one from yesterday?  Yeah.  From Glenn Burney.  Yep.  That's me.  You gave us 45 minutes of show yesterday.  Thank you.  Oh, you're welcome.  I was still talking with a friend of mine in D.C., and they were saying, your show sucks, man. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, man.  D.C. likes your show.  Well, you're listening, though, dude.  Yes, stupid.  There's nothing else on it.  Oh, well, there you go.  We went by default.  You know how stupid you sound if you call our show to tell us how much we suck day after  day, but that means you're listening?  I'm trying to help you guys out.  You're not helping.  I'm trying to get you guys some listeners.  Tom, you know what?  They want structure.  I used to be a radio junkie, okay?  And I would listen to a lot of radio stations.  But you know what?  I would decide on my own which stations were good and which ones stunk, and the stations 
[00:30:30]  that stunk never knew because I just wouldn't listen to them anymore.  All you and your friends get together and talk over what you're going to listen to?  You bunch of dull suburban white bags of jism.  You know what?  This guy, Tom, is going to end up in a year or so.  We're going to hear him.  Yeah, like crazy Paul.  Like crazy Paul.  Tom, you will be, mark my words, one of our hugest fans ever from JFK.  I don't think so, man.  You will be.  You'll sound like bunch of teenage girls gossiping. 
[00:31:00]  You're going to be in the fan hall of fame, by the way.  You are going to be one of our hugest fans ever in Washington.  I swear to you.  Tom, it's going to happen.  I see it already.  You called yesterday.  You bitched about the show.  We got a great bunch of radio out of it.  And now you're calling today to comment on what you did yesterday and how it affected  the show.  Like you're part of the show now, Tom.  You're Dickie Tom from Maryland now.  You just talk about your personal lives, video games. 
[00:31:30]  Nothing.  It doesn't mean anything to any of your listeners.  Oh, yeah.  No one can relate to the things we talk about and playing video games and talking about  sports and talking about hot shit.  Yeah, but, you know, I could call them.  I don't even mind and just talk about that stuff.  Exactly.  Don't you talk to your friends like that?  You're describing our show to a T.  Perfect.  Thank you.  You call your buddies.  You talk about nonsense.  Take this.  It's all promo.  It's perfect.  You need to tell stories to where, you know, someone would stop at your station and say,  well, you know, that's a cool story going on there.  Oh, you want stories? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, all right.  You wanted format.  Now you want stories?  What a doodle-y.  You want the Greaseman show.  What don't we do?  Yes.  I tell her.  I spin an interesting yarn.  What a doodle to the Greaseman.  Slinging leg.  Slinging leg.  When I was working for the Washington Police Department.  What a doodle.  One day a bank was being broken into by some criminals.  Well, I pulled out my trusty six-shooter.  I went in alone.  I didn't need backup. 
[00:32:30]  I'm Greaseman Alley.  What a doodle.  Sling bone dry.  I had just finished a bone dry at the local bar.  When the alarm came in, it was time for Greaseman to jump into action.  What a doodle.  The only guy that could take a one-line joke from a joke book and turn it into a 20-minute  store.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, 20 minutes to go by and they go, so I walked out of the bank a hero.  What?  You guys need some help.  And then we'll be back with more of the Beastman show after these words.  Yeah, what a doodle-y. 
[00:33:00]  All right, thank you.  If you don't like the show, why don't you stick your face into a pail of stillborns?  It's awful.  I'm trying to get you guys from listening, so that's all I'm doing.  Well, thank you, Tom.  Okay.  Forever in general.  Hold on, hold on, Tom.  Jim, pickle punks would have been funnier.  Oh.  Pickle punks?  People might not have gotten it.  I don't know what that is.  What's a pickle punk?  Pickled punk.  That's when you go to the side show.  Yeah, when you used to do the side shows at the circus, that was a big, big feature.  They were fetuses of deformed children in formaldehyde. 
[00:33:30]  They would call them pickled punks.  Oh, wow.  And they lined the shelves with them.  I never heard that.  All shelves lined with appetizers.  I'll tell you right now, we want a pickled punk for our office.  We've been trying to get one for years.  You have one just calling you in.  I want the big frog-headed kid.  The one with the regular body and his head is big.  He's got the big bulging eyes on top of his head.  Were they real people?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they were real.  Back then, there were plenty of them.  Back then, the hospitals were just, I don't know, throw them in jars and give them to the circus. 
[00:34:00]  Swear to God, they were side show attractions.  Pickled punks.  Crazy Paul from New York, what's up?  You know, this is deja friggin' vul for the third time now.  Yeah.  All right.  I was the original prick, son-of-a-bitch, scumbag, low-life dick that used to call you.  What do you mean was?  Oh, god damn F yourself, you freak.  Look it up here.  You hated us, Paul.  Hated us?  What makes you think I'm proven to your existence now, Anthony? 
[00:34:30]  That's true.  But at least you enjoy the program.  Well, yeah.  The thing is, I mean, to that guy in Washington, hate wasn't the word.  You're calling up and being nice.  I threaten these people with violence.  I tried bribery to get them off the air.  Yeah.  I tried any human thing possible.  Hate!  Hate!  Lots of hate!  And then when Philly came on board, it was me all over again.  But it was a lot of them.  Not as nasty and not as mean and not as much of a scumbag as I was. 
[00:35:00]  And now Washington.  Let me tell you.  See?  You'll all fall into place.  You'll all get sucked in.  That's it.  You get sucked in like a vacuum.  You guys are a vacuum.  It's an annoying sound.  You can't take the sound of that friggin' vacuum.  And, well, hey, it works.  We're like the black hole of radio.  You just get sucked in and you don't even understand why.  Yeah.  It just happens.  It's like a soap opera.  You gotta catch hold of the virus and then enjoy the virus that you got and give it to everybody else.  That's funny.  How do you feel about that, Tom? 
[00:35:30]  Oh, I don't know.  We'll get you like the ninja.  There you go.  Thank you, Crazy Paul.  Like the hiv.  No, that's not gonna happen.  That's not gonna happen.  You know, you should play that stupid crappy tape for him.  The ones where Anthony gave me the runaround to show him how much I hated you.  All right, we'll play that as we go to break.  Thank you, Paul.  All right, later.  All right.  There goes Crazy Paul.  Unfortunately, he's a fan now.  Look at Crazy Paul programming our show.  But we already had it queued up in CD4.  So, Tom.  Thank you, Tom, you tool.  Bye-bye.  All right. 
[00:36:00]  Smothers Brothers fan.  So, thank you to Anthony Violante from the Buffalo News.  What was the quote again?  The quote.  Shock Jocks Opie and Anthony took over afternoons with what may be the most offensive show in local radio history.  Love that.  I'm putting that on a plaque.  Here's Crazy Paul when he hated us and we'll be back as we play some of the really, really bad cards from the world.  Yeah.  All right.  Hello, N.E.W. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yes.  Hi.  Is this the program director?  No.  Who's this?  Oh, okay.  No, I just have a little bit of a complaint.  All right.  Who's this?  Oh, no.  Hi.  My name's Paul.  The two gentlemen that are on the radio now.  Paul, I'm just an intern.  Let me get the program director you want?  Yeah, or somebody, please.  Okay.  Hold on a minute, please.  I just want you guys to...  Engineering.  Hi, Engineering.  How are you?  All right.  Could you guys do me a favor?  What's the problem?  I'll give you guys a hundred bucks cash under the table to pull a plug on them two blabbermouth.  Come to play some music.  Hold.  You want programming?  This is engineering, sir. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, programming, please.  Oh, please hold.  Yeah, hello.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, do me a favor.  I'll give somebody in programming, whoever it is, I'll give them like five hundred bucks under  the table to shut these guys up for a little while and play some music or something.  What are you talking about?  Just leave your giant lounge.  This is who's house?  Uh, the jock lounge.  Oh, the jock...  Oh.  Where the DJs hang before they go on the air.  Oh, no.  They keep transferring me around.  I want to talk to somebody.  I mean, these guys are a little bit ridiculous today.  You know, let them...  They call themselves disc jockeys.  Let them throw on some discs. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Something.  You want the PD or the general manager?  Uh, I guess the program director would be fine.  I'm not going to bother the general manager.  Maintenance.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yellow.  That's great.  You guys are great.  Okay.  Very funny.  That's pretty cool.  Maintenance.  But, yeah, you guys keep ping-ponging me around.  Is there any way to shut those two dudes up?  You want programming, sir?  Sure.  Why not?  I'll hang out and play the game.  Go for it.  Programming.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm trying to get...  I'm trying to talk to somebody to keep Tweedledum and Tweedledum and just a little bit quieter 
[00:38:00]  and play some more tunes.  Is that possible?  Who's Tweedledee and Tweedledum?  No, Tweedledum and Tweedledum.  Yeah, but them two yahoos you got blabbering on the radio.  That's why two old women from Long Island.  Is there any way to sit down for you to Tweedledum and just play a couple more tunes?  Is that possible?  Are you looking for programming?  I don't know who they got to be looking for now.  Where am I?  Where did I get now?  I apologize.  We're having a problem with the phone system.  Can you hold on one last second?  Hey, no problem.  I'm cold.  All right.  Hold on.  You've reached 1-900. 
[00:38:30]  Suck my...  On Game Mail 6.  If you like big fists of...  Stay on the line.  You'll get a hot...  Right in your mouth.  To blow...  All over that face of yours.  Wow.  It seems like every hole in my body  is exploding every liquid imaginable. 
[00:39:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  Hey, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sounds like one of the Diablos cars you're jacked.  Grand Theft Auto 3.  We were talking about Pickle Punks, Anthony?  Yeah.  Here's a picture of a two-headed... 
[00:39:30]  Ooh.  Pickle Punk.  Let me see the cute little guy.  We'll have to talk to Steve from foundrymusic.com, our underground website.  Maybe he could put up a few pictures of Pickle Punks.  Wow.  This isn't just two-headed.  This is like a cluster F of baby.  Picture you take two babies made out of silly putty and smash them together.  This is stem cell research gone bad.  Look at this.  Let me see.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, you got it?  Yeah.  Okay, same one.  And that little Pickle Punk.  Yeah.  You know what would be good?  Having the color picture of that or just the actual picture?  Put it in your wallet and when everybody's showing pictures of their kids, go, let me  show you the little fella and pull that one out.  Even better, take that picture to the mall and get a little t-shirt made.  Daddy's girl.  You know what?  I want one of those.  Really bad.  Come on, get me one.  The first person that gets us a t-shirt made, it's got to say Daddy's little princess or Daddy's 
[00:40:30]  girl and the most horrific, abnormal child, pickled punk on the front.  Remember the Christmas card that one of our listeners sent us one year in?  That would be the armless and legless woman on the bed with the Christmas hat on?  Or is it Quaalude and...  Quaalude and...  Fang.  And Fang.  Fang and Quaalude.  Wasn't that Chuck Farham, our friend from the left coast?  Yeah.  He would send out the really outrageous Christmas cards every year and he had the one of the 
[00:41:00]  woman naked with no arms and no legs on the bed with a Christmas hat on.  And then there was Fang and Quaalude, two little black kids sitting in front of a Christmas  tree or something.  One kid's eyes, I can't even describe them.  They were half shut and cockeyed.  And the other kid, Fang, his teeth were so messed up.  He had like two teeth in his head and they were all twisted and messed up.  It was horrendous.  Quaalude and Fang.  Yeah.  And it was a Christmas.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  We could call them Earl's kids.  You did.  Hey, Earl, is your kid?  I didn't do that.  You did.  You did.  I did not.  By the way, can I clarify real quick?  They add some mistake.  I am not doing this Rascals gig.  Jeff Norris and Mitch Wasser are on it and that's a great show.  I'm not on that show.  Just to clarify that.  All right.  John, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, you want to see a real pickle punk?  San Gennaro Festival.  They have one?  Yes, they do.  Every year they got it in a truck.  It's like two bucks to see it.  You go in there, it's a two-headed one.  The one that you're talking about.  Wait, wait, wait.  Down in Little Italy? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Right on Mulberry Street.  Get Joey on the phone.  We could have it up here today.  Leave it to the guineas.  They have it in a truck every year down there.  Hey, you want to see something?  Nah, you know something, though?  It's probably not real.  It looks pretty real.  It's probably not real.  Nah, it looked real.  I know, boy.  It's quite the little gimmick going on down there, San Gennaro.  I know I threw a few free darts the first year I went down there, and I was going to  get beat up unless I handed a 20 over at the end of it. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, chill out, dude.  They got the statue covered with, like, $1,000 stuck to the statue.  Where did the money go?  I went to one of the booths because I like shooting darts.  I consider myself pretty fair at it.  And I'm throwing the darts, and the guy goes, ah, try three more.  Try three more.  No, go ahead.  It's no problem.  No problem.  I'm like, I'll try three more.  This is many years ago.  I'm throwing.  He goes, ah, so close.  And he looks around.  He looks around like he's looking for his boss or something.  He goes, ah, come on.  Give it another shot.  So the way he presents it is like, ah, look at this. 
[00:43:00]  All right, I'll try again.  And then I get done.  I go, ah, I'm going to move on.  Hey, hey, hey, $20.  I'm like, wait a minute.  He goes, hey, you threw nine darts, $20.  I was like, but you gave him.  No, look, what am I giving?  I'm not giving.  Moose Rocco, help Anthony find his wallet.  So that was the last time.  Yeah, it was a cheap education, $20. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, all right.  That's for the rubes, the out-of-town, you know, rubes.  Well, uh, Joe.  There's a Long Island rube.  We're trying to find a pickled punk, so, uh.  Yeah, well, call Joey up.  Maybe he'll know.  Well, maybe Joey knows a little bit about the pickled punk from the fest.  It's in the town, man.  All right, take care.  From the feast, they can say.  In the truck.  You've got to go into the truck?  I don't know about that.  Leave the gun.  Take the cannolis.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, Scott.  Hey.  Hey, this is Matt's week, and I've seen that some of you parents are working. 
[00:44:00]  He started this radio campaign.  He got Scott and Todd in his party in the morning in a freaking doghouse.  He gazed and he was thinking.  They're, what?  They're in a commercial.  Scott and Todd, they're in a freaking doghouse.  And Scott's partner turns to him and says,  Hey, Scott, who says we're not the biggest dogs in New York?  Oh, my God.  At least it's a step up from their commercial where they dressed as women. 
[00:44:30]  I mean, who the heck gives them this idea that somebody's going to be turned on like a 16-year-old girl's going to...  Wow.  Stop with that cursing.  Oh, yeah, I know.  This isn't the Scott and Todd show, mister.  Yeah, we're not the biggest dogs.  Yeah, we can't be having that foul language on here.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  Family show.  What's the problem?  What happened?  Go ahead.  Talk about it.  What happened?  I just got a thing from Stinky. 
[00:45:00]  Really big letters.  I thought, like, some girl had given me her number to call.  Yeah, again.  Jeff Norris.  Oh.  I'm all ready to get spongy in the privates, and it's a judo black belt.  Oh, look at the...  Why are people sending me this now?  Someone thought it was funny to send me a granny, a real old lady, naked, just really showing everything, dressed in Christmas gear.  Oh, my God. 
[00:45:30]  Look at that.  Yay.  Let me go to Brent.  Brent, what's up?  Hey, what's up, brother?  Hey, Norton.  Hello, sir.  Yeah, sorry to...  It might not be on the same thing, but there's a whole museum of pickle punks.  Where?  It's in Philadelphia.  It's a medical museum.  They have all these little babies with their heads crushed from forceps and stuff, and these little jars.  Oh, yeah.  I've heard about this medical museum.  Oh, it's...  Why didn't Mr. Slackman, Tim Sabian, bring us to this medical museum?  That's something I would have wanted to see when I went to Philly.  Yeah, no, it's...  It's not where Benjamin Franklin used to live, and it's not even a house anymore. 
[00:46:00]  Ben Franklin's non-existent house frame.  That's great.  Hey, Tim Sabian, come on over here.  We'll show you where Ben Franklin's house is.  I'm like, oh, all right.  A little bit of history.  Maybe it'll be like one of the old villages you go in.  You go in the house, and it'll sort of...  Look, it was his glasses.  There's a wire of him, glasses on a table that he must have used.  We walk into this alleyway, and there's cement beams in the shape of a box house.  And it says, this is where his house was before it burnt down. 
[00:46:30]  And then explain where everything was in the house, right over there.  Oh, big bump.  Here's where the printing press would have been.  That really was an atrocious tour of Philadelphia.  The most interesting part of his...  We can go into the medical museum in Philly, and...  He's in the Pickled Punks.  Yeah, Pickled Punks, they got cats of Siamese twins.  They got people's heads cut in half, where you see the brain in the eye.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  Yeah.  It's pretty sick, too.  I smell Philly field trip. 
[00:47:00]  Well, I think we're going to be...  Get a cheesesteak before you go, too.  I think we're going to broadcast down there January 25th when Norton does his shows down  there on a fly.  Yeah, I think it's on 22nd and something.  It's like a medical museum in Philly.  So we'll get down there early, and we'll check out the medical museum.  Yeah.  Look at a few Pickled Punks.  I think there's a website that has some of those pictures on.  It's called MUTTER.  M-U-T-T-E-R.  Oh, you know the website?  No, I just...  I'm sure if you go to, like, MUTTERMuseum.com, I mean, how many people have a MUTTERMuseum website?  How do you spell it?  M-U-T-T-E-R. 
[00:47:30]  Wouldn't that be MUTTER?  MUTTER.  No, it's a German...  Is it a German doctor?  MUTTER!  MUTTER!  Das MUTTER!  Das MUTTER!  MUTTER!  Nice.  I hope we can go.  We might have to go see Thomas Jefferson's Old Fence.  If Tim Sabian takes us on another tour.  Here's George Washington's property marker.  Ooh!  Sucked.  I'm thrilled.  It was the worst.  Bad coffee.  What an awful 40-minute walk around the block. 
[00:48:00]  Here's the CBS I bought my 14-year-old boy's slacks in that I'm wearing now.  I know.  Thanks for putting in the effort.  We're going to walk around the block, and it's going to take 40 minutes.  It did.  It took 40 minutes.  We went around the block with Tim.  We finally get down to Philly, and that's what he gives us.  So at least he walked around the block.  That's embarrassing.  Then he takes us back upstairs, and here's a signed Black Sabbath poster you can't have.  All right.  That was horrible.  Use your imagination, Torf.  And now we find out that there's a... 
[00:48:30]  The medical museum.  The Pickle Punk Museum.  And a bunch of babies in jars.  A bunch of them.  And it's the Mütter Museum?  Das Mütter.  Das Mütter, ja!  That's the Mütter.  That's the Mütter.  Hey, hey.  You're a mad man.  Hey, ho.  It said schnitzel.  All right.  It's German.  Schnitzel.  Thank you, bro.  Das schnitzel.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right.  Bye.  Later.  What a coup that is.  Look at that.  Hey.  Thank you for the info. 
[00:49:00]  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  You tell us.  Yeah, that commercial I saw with Anthony's head on the sumo wrestler is hilarious.  And then you got that big jackhammer.  And he's, like, just jacking that.  And it says, like, 1027.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  Right.  Are you talking about one of those old radio commercials?  Oh, oh.  That isn't you guys?  No.  Oh, oh, oh.  That's right.  You guys are the ones where it's, like, Opie and Anthony, and you guys are, like, gymnasts?  No.  And you go over the horse.  That's you, right?  No, we're the one where we made believe we were fat, and we had the big boombox, and 
[00:49:30]  we were dancing in front of the brick wall.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  You're mistaken that.  I remember our commercial.  We chainsaw through a wall and bust through, and I go, if we weren't so bad, we wouldn't  be so good.  That's right.  That's it.  Wow.  Isn't it you guys that put the one shirt on, and you look right at each other, and you  pretend you're Siamese twin pickled punks?  Hey, you know what?  We'll do that. 
[00:50:00]  They wanted to put our faces on the wow billboards.  Yeah.  No way.  No thank you.  Two floating heads.  We could have had our faces in the middle of Times Square, and we said, no thank you.  Too queer.  You look like Voss's website.  You're right.  There's dumb howdy doody bouncing heads.  Creepy is.  No, we didn't get married, Rick.  We didn't do the fake marriage thing, where one of us dresses like a girl, and we make  the paper.  That's an old radio bitch.  I'm going to have to investigate this further. 
[00:50:30]  The link I just got to the...  The muta?  No, no.  Breaking news on the Christina Aguilera sex tape.  There's supposed to be...  You know, I am going to investigate this further.  I'm not giving this address out yet, but I am looking, and I'm looking at pictures.  I don't see anything from the front.  That's what it is.  I can't see her face or anything.  Turn it around.  I'm looking at her...  See, these are so far the only ones I got. 
[00:51:00]  This is supposedly her?  It's supposed to be Christina Aguilera having sex.  There's a whole video to it.  I'm just looking at still pictures.  I don't see anything from the front, but it certainly does look like her body.  I'll investigate the hands and some of her jewelry, and I will get back to you.  Yeah, it's...  Dude, if that's her, that's...  You're like...  You gotta be...  Weeks of spanking material.  You gotta be honest, though.  I mean, that could be any blonde.  It could be any blonde.  From those shots.  Let me look.  So you don't really know.  Oh, the shots by shots, you mean pictures, not this last picture. 
[00:51:30]  No, no.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to Angie.  Angie.  Yeah?  Angie.  Me?  Hey, Angie.  I'm not playing the Rolling Stones pinball machine, by the way.  What?  Angie from Cleveland, what's up?  Hey.  I got a question for you guys.  Yeah.  Me and my friends are playing GTA 3.  Nice.  Uh-huh.  And it's an early mission.  Mind you, we're girls, and we're playing video games, so bear with me. 
[00:52:00]  There's a mission where you have to shoot the people on the boat, and then 8-Ball is  supposed to go in and blow up the boat.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  How the hell do you pass that?  You know something?  You got to get up on that roof with the sniper rifle.  We did that.  And then the first guys you take out are the guys right by the ramp.  And then you've got to kill everyone from left to right.  From left to right?  One at a time.  So as 8-Ball's running, the guy he's running towards is already dead.  And take the pill that makes you slow down. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, that helps, too.  You have to take the slow-mo pill.  The slow-mo pill is in between the cart and the, what are they called, Ant?  The shipping, yeah, the shipping containers.  Containers.  I think they're shipping containers.  So if you take the slow-mo pill, then you'll be able to get through that.  Yeah, but like Ant said, you've got to shoot, you've got to snipe them left to right from  the roof of that building.  Mm-hmm.  Dude.  There you go.  Have fun.  Let us know if it works.  Okay.  All right.  Can I say one more thing?  Yeah.  I just want to tell you that since you guys came to Cleveland, you've been 
[00:53:00]  giving me a reason to listen to the radio again.  Oh, I thought you were going to go to live.  No, not to live.  That's what really made me feel better than just listen, live.  No, because, to tell you the truth, radio in Cleveland really sucked until you guys  came along, so.  Thank you, Angie.  Well, thanks, Angie.  Stop.  You want us to play the Stones for you?  The what?  Thanks.  I appreciate it.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Why aren't you going to play the Stones pinball machine?  We've got a Rolling Stones pinball machine, and it rocks, man. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, but I'm not going to play it.  It's like circa 1978, 79.  Things are your old-fashioned pinball machine.  It's the producer of the Ron and Fez show.  He's trying to buy my love, and I will not be playing the Rolling Stone pinball machine.  Maybe he just bought it, because Mick looks like he's packing 14 on the front of that thing.  You see the Mick picture on the front.  What a mule.  The producer of the show after us here in New York, I have, when was the last time I  said hi to him?  Six months ago, and we probably first came in, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  We have to pass him every day, and at this point, he's trying to, like, you know, buy  my love.  He's the type of guy that does crave the affection of everybody here, especially the people's  affection that he cannot get, which is yours.  That's right.  I had a run-in with the guy, had a problem with the foosball table.  You're a better man than me.  He knocked over your foosball table, completely destroyed it.  Yeah.  Unplayable, and you still talk to the guy.  An ordinary guy would have just turned around when I said, hey, you broke the foosball table. 
[00:54:30]  I want a new one.  So, you know something?  Go F yourself.  You put it in there.  It's a, you know, rowdy atmosphere.  Things happen.  But he so wants to be loved that he actually went out and got a new pinball machine.  The first one he got, not to my liking.  I made him get rid of it and get another one.  Foosball table.  Foosball table.  Foosball table.  Just to be a prick.  Yeah, foosball table.  And now he got a pinball machine, because, you know, I enjoy a game of pinball every once  in a while.  So now, trying to figure out a way to get Opie's love, he got this pinball machine. 
[00:55:00]  It's set up out there now.  People are enjoying it.  I won't play it.  You won't play it.  I told Ronnie, I said, Ron, if it was a Nirvana Kurt Cobain pinball machine, watch what  happens now.  It would have softened me up a little bit.  Dude, watch.  Watch.  We will.  Or if we could have got our Galaga slash Ms. Pac-Man game back.  Miss that one, don't you?  Yeah.  That got repossessed.  Not enough mentions on the air.  No, we didn't get enough mentions. 
[00:55:30]  It was repossessed.  So our arcade outside the studio is pretty lame right now.  A foosball table with a bent rod.  With bent rods.  Someone bent one of the back rods.  It's all wobbly.  And now a Rolling Stone pinball machine.  Yeah.  Can't have anything good around here.  All right.  Oh, here's the guy that sent in the Aguilera sex link.  Brian.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, man.  Did you guys check it out?  Well, I am downloading one of the movie clips right now. 
[00:56:00]  It's pretty busy.  I looked at it.  I don't know.  It seems too good to be true.  You know what?  Too good to be true and no face shot.  Yeah.  So far, as I can see, if you're going to be banging Christina Aguilera, I want a full close-up  on that face.  But the camera's still speedy.  I couldn't move it, though.  Well, is that it?  Turn her around.  Turn her around.  He looks like he could spin her around and dog it.  Maybe the guy didn't even know what was going on.  This is just a couple that, you know, made a sex tape and said, look, it's Christina Aguilera. 
[00:56:30]  My girlfriend looks like Christina Aguilera.  We'll film it from behind.  And we'll have radio guys all over America talk about it.  We'll get sick traffic.  Well, I think they might be right.  Well, I'm not giving out the website.  All right.  Let's see.  As Christina Aguilera has.  Did you see the thing above that talks about you?  My hidden camera.  Christina Aguilera filmed a steamy sex film with the star.  The videotape is being circulated around L.A., according to American Magazine, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:57:00]  A guy from Los Angeles is going around bragging about being with Christina and showing his friends the tape.  It was taken months ago of her getting hot and heavy with him.  It's pretty graphic.  That's not her butt.  Christina Aguilera didn't even know she had a starring role in the sex film.  Why isn't it her butt?  It's too meaty.  Too meaty?  Too big.  You think?  I don't know.  She's got the same kind of hips.  That nice butt.  But Christina Aguilera has like a smaller butt.  What is that?  Eatabullet.com?  Wow. 
[00:57:30]  You whore.  Oh, my God.  But what a great plug.  You whore.  Oh, my God.  That side's going to get pounded.  Wow.  Your server just crashed.  Believe me.  What?  Eatabullet.com.  Stink.  Dude, look at the hips.  If you look at her in the Moulin Rouge video, her hips kind of look the same.  It ain't her. 
[00:58:00]  Why would she still wear extensions in her hair?  Just have sex with a guy.  I don't know.  Her hair, you can't go by the hair.  It changes.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  All right, tools.  All right.  And we'll decide if it's fake or real by the end of the show.  I will say fake, real, or not sure.  I can't tell.  Okay.  Chris, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, at the Muni Museum, they got a lot of cool stuff in there.  If you go in there, they got a colon that's the size of a person.  It's like a six-foot colon.  It was impacted in somebody. 
[00:58:30]  And the guy, like, lived with it for, like, a long time.  And, like, they took it out of him.  It's the size of, like, another person, a colon.  We're going to the medical museum in Philly.  They got a head.  They got a real human head.  They slice like a ham out of a deli.  And, like, you can see, like, different parts of it.  It's like seven slices of it, like, just in a row.  I've seen what they did.  What they did, some prisoner gave his life, you know, after he was killed to science, his body.  They freeze-dry you.  And then they slice you in slices that are so thin. 
[00:59:00]  It's like nice, thinly sliced ham.  Like a jelly slicer?  Yeah.  It's exactly what it is.  And you can see, like, the different parts of, like, the brain.  Yeah.  They scan it into a computer.  And before you know it, you could look at any piece, any cross-section of any organ in the human body.  It's really kind of wild.  It's really hot, isn't it, Norton?  You're going to try that one at home with some poor, unsuspecting hooker?  Get in the fridge.  You guys are great.  Get in the freezer, you bitch.  Thank you.  Got to start this rolling. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  We better take a break, huh?  Mm-hmm.  On the way, Anthony, some of these bad carts from the back wall.  I want to hear these.  We have the Less Beans cart, But's So Low, Good Ship Titanic, The Fudge Pack, The Bad Jet Song.  Oh, my God.  The Fudge Pack.  Remember that one?  The Bad Prostate Song by Skidmark.  Remember Skidmark?  Little Skidmark.  What's he now?  I think he's 47 years old now. 
[01:00:00]  Got to be.  So we'll play some of these really bad carts as we try to clean house here for the new year, Anthony, for the new year.  Also, up next, another winner of the Unlucky Lottery.  Unlucky Lottery.  Coming next.  You guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  And EW.  And we're back with the O&A show. 
[01:00:30]  Oi.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  FU line is open as well.  If you need that phone number, go to opiananthony.com, okay?  Roy.  What are you laughing at, Jimmy?  I just checked my email, and it's just a few of the tools that went through to eat a bullet.  And they're like, where's the sex video, dude?  They leave the emails.  They were very displeased. 
[01:01:00]  Jackass.  I think if people knew.  Ant is going to give his, I'm giving my decision.  Give your decision on the Christina Aguilera sex tape.  That is authenticity.  Being floated around right now.  I'm still working on it, you know?  That one picture's...  Yeah, but now I'm looking at pictures of Christina Aguilera.  All right, wait.  Turn that around, please.  Hold on.  Let me pop up one that kind of...  I say that her boobs aren't that big.  Right, you say her boobs aren't that big, and you think her butt is too big for the... 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, there's a shot, well, a still picture on the internet.  Shows it from behind there, and one of her udders, it looks like a big udder.  Big cans.  It just looks too big.  I don't know, though.  She seems to have some chest in some of these.  You guys, I mean, I got to watch the tape.  No, no, it is so obvious that it's fake, because if this guy really had Christina Aguilera 
[01:02:00]  in this position, and he was taping her, wouldn't you make sure there's a camera that's going  to show her face?  Maybe it does at one point in the video.  Because then it's like, bingo.  Look at her hips in this.  All right?  Man, her boobs are...  Look at their tiny.  No, they look big.  She's not...  She's in a top that's a little...  Compared to the sex tape, they're tiny in that picture.  But it was a side view with her bent over, and the gravity's pulling them down on the  sex tape.  Man, I know you.  You're not that naive. 
[01:02:30]  Either way, she...  I want to believe, okay?  I want to believe.  All right!  You're like the little fellow that won't acknowledge you saw Dad biting the cookie on Christmas Eve.  And that's really a Santa bag, not a little shopping bag in a bathroom stall.  Crinkle, crinkle.  My confused little suit.  All right.  All right.  I'll come to a decision.  Soon?  I'm telling you, it's not real. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  It's really obvious that it's not real.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  If this is your shot at the big time, you got her.  And you're filming her.  You're going to set up a four-camera shoot.  Look at this, though, dude.  She's gorgeous.  Take a look at that.  Wow.  What's going on there?  But look at her boobs.  They're small.  Wow.  Those are barely Bs right there, Ann.  And in the sex video, they're full Cs, close to a D.  Well, now I'm going to have to go back to the sex video.  All right. 
[01:03:30]  A lot of people want to see this for themselves.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  You'll have to wait.  All right.  But we would be scumbags if we didn't, you know, at least tell them where they could...  We are scumbags.  Don't you realize?  But let them decide for themselves.  All right.  I'll take another look at that one picture.  You know what would be cool, Ann?  Yeah.  You've got to make your decision.  Then we give out the website.  Then we can take calls and people will help you.  Okay.  Here it is.  I'm popping up this picture.  And I'll do a side-by-side with Christina and this picture. 
[01:04:00]  All right, Norton, come here.  Okay.  Look at the...  Look at her bod here.  Okay?  That's some shot.  Oh, wow.  You like that?  Oh.  Turn it around.  Now, the breasts are way too big.  Yeah.  Way too big, right?  That's exactly the point.  That's D.  That looks like a little clam there.  All right.  That is...  Hold on.  That's a D.  Whoever this girl is, she's worth checking out. 
[01:04:30]  She is put together.  Yeah.  Boy, what a looker.  Quite a bit so.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  Now you've got the real picture of Christina Aguilar on the right side.  Then you've got the picture that supposedly could be her and the sex video on the  left.  There's no way, eh?  Okay.  That is a huge boob.  All right.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Yeah.  The boob.  That is huge.  One of the videos is hotter.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Look at this.  Oh.  What's going on there?  Can you imagine that with just yellow loveliness flying out of it? 
[01:05:00]  Look at what's poking out from behind here.  Oh, you eat a lot of asparagus, don't you, young lady?  Yeah.  Here comes Steve C.  All right, Steve.  This, I think, is the incriminating shot.  Because look here.  Right?  Yeah, Steve's a professional.  That's hanging down.  Steve.  That's a stripper.  Not even remotely real.  It's a stripper.  That's a stripper from behind.  It's a stripper.  Okay.  And that's my decision.  That hair looks fake. 
[01:05:30]  Like, you ever see Dressed to Kill Angie Dickinson's hair?  No.  You think that's Angie Dickinson?  No, not Angie Dickinson.  Michael Caine?  You think that's Michael Caine?  When he was slicing women?  Right.  Oh, wow.  Michael Caine.  Bobby, when he left the office as a woman?  I want you to give out the website and then let everyone else decide.  Even though, you know, this is what this guy wanted.  Here it is.  Notorious for putting up fakes.  For fakes?  Notorious for fakes?  You might as well say it on the air.  What?  That website that you're looking at right now, they're notorious for putting up fakes. 
[01:06:00]  They last for a day or two, then Christina's people are going to call and, you know, with  a cease and desist and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, you know what I think I'm seeing on the side of the boob, too?  Implant wrinkle.  Some of that implant wrinkle on the side.  Look.  Love that.  Look at this right here, right?  That's exactly what that is.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's always fakes on that one, that richvoss.com.  Nothing.  Why are you helping out your friend?  Here it is.  How about yourself?  Nah.  It's, of course, www.naked-celebs.com. 
[01:06:30]  Naked-celebs.com.  And then find the link from there and you'll...  All right.  And let us know what you think.  You sit down with one of your buddies, maybe on the couch and you download it and just the  two boys watch it together.  Here, get a blanket so no one's embarrassed.  All right.  I'll help you if you help me. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, God.  What is wrong with you, man?  All right.  Anthony, unlucky lottery.  Unlucky lottery.  We talk about this.  It's pretty much the same odds.  It takes the same odds for this unfortunate thing to happen to you than it would take to  win the lottery.  It's easier to win the lottery.  It's easier to win the lottery.  Than the unlucky lottery.  But did you win the lottery?  No.  You won horrid death. 
[01:07:30]  What was the last unlucky lottery we had on the show?  Was that the jet ski accident with the...  The duck.  The duck.  Yes, it was.  A guy, it seems, was a jet ski and having a little fun.  He was being videotaped by a friend on a boat.  The friend put the camera down.  By the time he looked up, his friend is off the jet ski.  Might have dumped it.  So he pulls the boat up to find his friend.  What does he see floating in the water?  A dead duck.  And a dead friend. 
[01:08:00]  A dead friend.  His friend hit the duck.  They collided.  Hit him in the head.  Jet ski was going about 50 miles an hour on the water.  He got nailed with a duck.  Duck dies.  Unlucky lottery.  What are the odds of that happening to you?  Yeah.  Right?  One in 20, maybe.  Check.  One in 20?  What are you saying?  Awful.  Sight's already crashed.  No one can get to it. 
[01:08:30]  Let me go to Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Steve.  Yo.  You're on the radio.  What's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Hey, we wanted to take a look at our taint.  See if you could guess our age.  And then maybe you could tell if it's really hard enough.  I don't have a perfect shot of the taint.  But I would definitely say the 20 to 22.  Oh.  There you go.  Nice to meet you, man.  Thank you, Steve.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  Stoner calling from his igloo in Buffalo.  If I was nailing Christina Aguilera, I'd have 10 cameras. 
[01:09:00]  Then I'd donkey punch the bitch and take a picture of me teabagging her.  Of course.  Yeah.  That's what I said.  Four camera shoots.  Not one from behind that's in the closet.  Old donkey punch.  You can't really tell if it's her or not.  Good boy.  My son.  All right.  I went to the site.  You said completely bogus, says John Grant from Brooklyn.  Everybody saying bogus.  That it's bogus.  All right.  Okay.  Anthony.  So here's the latest unlucky lottery winner. 
[01:09:30]  Four die as tree crushes car.  Ah.  Remember yesterday you were talking about your trip to Utah?  Uh-huh.  With that big rock on that little, little, little, little needle thing.  Balanced rock over there.  It's amazing.  Balancing rock in the middle of the desert.  It's just a, it looks like a huge boulder on a golf tee.  And it's gigantic.  Been there for forever.  And someday it'll fall.  Could be minutes from now.  Could be a million years from now.  We just don't know.  That's how it works.  It looks like nature's down syndrome. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  You just can't quite figure it out.  It's not quite right.  All right.  So.  Big head.  So this is very, very similar to that, I believe, Anthony.  Four die as tree crushes car.  This happened in Indiana.  A dead tree fell on top of a passing car.  Passing car.  Passing car.  Not even like you're parked there.  Right.  Crushing the passenger compartment and killing a minister, his wife.  A minister.  And two of their three children.  Guy's doing God's work and this is how God repays him. 
[01:10:30]  Tree falls on your family.  You're going to be the winner of the unlucky lottery.  Now, if you were parked under the tree, the odds are greater that this could happen.  Of course.  A stationary object.  You are driving by this tree.  What are the odds?  You are under that tree for how long?  I think if you hit the tree, the odds go up.  Way less than a second.  Way less than a second.  You're under that tree for, yeah, like that.  Split second.  Split second.  The timing would have to be.  Perfect.  Like a stuntman couldn't time it better. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  To have it happen.  Hooper couldn't time it better.  When the big smoke stack fell down.  There you go.  Yeah.  It says no wind, no storm.  The chances of that tree falling at the time they were directly underneath it are astronomical.  That means big.  That means big.  Killed in Monday's accident were Stan, Beth, Tyler, and Lauren Jones.  Little Tyler.  Emily Fore was in fair condition in the hospital. 
[01:11:30]  One person crossing the street ten blocks earlier.  Hold on, Ben's got a good site.  What is this?  Whoa, what's this now?  Comparison.  Where did that come from?  Someone sent it.  Oh, so there's a link to that?  Yeah.  All right, let me find that.  All right.  Well, what is it?  I'll find it on instant feedback.  Hold on.  What's it?  It may be proof.  There's some video, too.  Whoa, we got video.  All right.  Oh, yes.  That's not Christina Aguilera.  Let's see.  That's nice.  Now we got moving video. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  Oh, my God.  Let's take a look.  All right.  Well, no, huh?  No, that's not her.  Wow.  Oh, you're on that chick.  Girl is beautiful, but that's not her.  What color down there?  You like the shade?  Little brownish tinge just to show you what it's really used for.  Decide for yourself.  Oh, nice.  Where are the stats?  Oh, here it is.  Note fantastic symmetry. 
[01:12:30]  Note odd boob size and shape.  Yeah.  Proof.  That's, yeah, the boobs, that's where it, uh, interesting.  This website used the same picture we did to determine that it was a fake, Anthony.  Wow.  Way.  Yeah, that's, uh, what's her name?  Katie Holmes.  Katie Holmes.  If you scroll a little further down, you'll see a hot Katie Holmes in some water.  Holy crap.  Is it nice?  Norton, why are you poking me in the side with your thumb?  That's not my thumb. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  That's good.  Are there any naked pictures?  Yeah, okay.  Those aren't pillows.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  How about those bears?  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  I love them.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Jesus.  Hey, and if we don't start playing some of these bad cards.  I know.  Look at us.  We're so, uh...  Our listeners are going to kill us.  Let's go into this Christina Aguilera thing.  We, uh, we have taken over, uh, most of the space here in this studio, and there's one 
[01:13:30]  wall of carts.  Yeah.  There's got to be hundreds of them.  Mm-hmm.  Things we used to play for whatever reason.  Sometimes, uh, we wanted to play them.  Sometimes we didn't want to.  That's right.  And now to play them out of context will make us look really silly.  Good.  But that's okay.  Uh, well, we got a couple, uh, bad Jets songs.  We can start with this.  Yeah.  I don't even know the story of this.  Maybe some of the older listeners can help us.  Wow.  I think the Jets were having a fine playoff run a few years back.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, the, the PD decided that, uh, he was gonna, he was gonna, uh, have us do 
[01:14:00]  a Jets song.  Or have the production guy do a Jets song.  And I, I, it's safe to say that we did play these on the air, and, uh, we definitely goofed  on it.  We didn't play these on the air saying, wow, that's such a, such a great little song.  That's a great tune.  So you want to hear a little bit of this?  Yeah, let's, uh, let's hear this.  Well, one is titled, Perhaps the Worst Jets Song Ever.  And then, uh, the other one's called, uh, The Jets Song.  So.  All right. 
[01:14:30]  Well, we gotta save, perhaps, the Worst Jets Song Ever for the second.  We'll play this one first.  Okay.  In local radio history or ever.  Uh-oh.  This is the Macho.  No, YMCA?  The Macho.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, YMCA.  Oh.  And you'll see what I mean, team tune-up.  New York's new favorite team. 
[01:15:00]  And they go by the name, they dream.  It's all the time.  That we got all the breaks.  And we don't care.  Hey.  Do whatever we take.  Get the marino.  Hey.  We won't fall from their face.  Come on and sing this song with me now.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh.  Turn it off. 
[01:15:30]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  What do you say?  How about a nice bucket of A's? 
[01:16:00]  Ah.  Oh.  Finally.  Oh.  He's my favorite of all.  He's too big.  They said he was too small.  No!  No!  Shut up!  What is that?  This is so bad.  But it's the only same thing.  Come with me now.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[01:16:30]  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  The drag queen.  Oh, it's the worst.  God.  We'll see you, Nick, on line eight.  Let's go to Nick.  Nick, what's going on?  Yeah, boy.  I am a diehard Jet fan.  Listening to this song makes me feel like you should be getting railed by Norton.  This is the worst thing.  This is the gayest thing I've ever heard in my life. 
[01:17:00]  Is this so gay?  And now we've got to go beat Oakland.  You have to listen to this?  Yes.  Yes, boy.  Bye, Nick.  Bye.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Oh, I'll be watching Vinny's last game.  Somebody actually thought that was cool when they did it.  Yeah.  Because there's no funny lines.  And they're like, ah, it's a good giving to rally the team's fans.  Yeah, but that's what you do when you work in radio.  He's my favorite of all.  And they thought that he was too small.  Can I say for the record, whoever wrote that and sang it, I hope they were killed in a drunk 
[01:17:30]  driving accident on the way to a family member's wedding.  Wow.  Oh, man.  You reached deep for that.  That is the worst thing I've ever heard.  Now, that wasn't possibly the worst.  No.  Stop it.  No.  Tommy from Staten Island writes, the songs were back from the Jets' 1998-99 season.  I was hoping to get ear cancer since then so I wouldn't have to hear this crap again.  So that was the second worst.  Okay.  That was only the second worst. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, just some of the carts that were playing today from the back wall.  Trust me, we definitely goofed on these songs when we first played them a few years back.  Here's the worst Jets song ever made, it's called.  I hate it already.  Jets!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jets!  I can always remember long-suffering faces  With Waltz in and Countside and Nagle at 1 and 15 
[01:18:30]  And Jets  You brought the tuna  None too soon  Here comes gangrene  Just how you've been around in a couple of seasons  With me and T-Shot and Jumbo and Little Cribbets 
[01:19:00]  And Jets  I think the Broncos will turn to the wussies when they suffer the Jets!  Yes!  Oh, my God!  Uh-uh!  Yes!  You're speechless!  Oh, my God!  Uh-uh!  Denver!  Denver!  Brian Cox will be slapped still away!  Denver! 
[01:19:30]  Terrell Davis won't get his way!  Uh-uh!  Denver!  Dismember!  They've got Vinny from Elmont, the storybook hero  He hands off to Martin 
[01:20:00]  And Keyshawn  He gets the damn ball  Sweet, merciful crowd  And Jets  They won't stop in Denver  Or in Miami  Till they win it out!  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  All right, I'll turn it off then  It was more pleasant hearing about Jets on September 11th  Than that song  I thought I told you to shut up!  By the way, the Broncos kicked our ass 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah, exactly  They kicked our ass  No one showed Elway nothing  That's right  They ran all over us  There you have it  Hold it  You can't just say, there you have it  That takes some recovery time  Holy mackerel  Somebody wrote that  And then somebody else went, no, no, try this line  Oh, yeah  Wow  The only  Oh, my God  I feel like that  Only thing that that song's missing is a  How you doing 
[01:21:00]  How you doing?  How you doing?  For the Jets!  In the Keyshawn!  Oh, my God  The song of the Jets!  We got hundreds of these things from the back wall  I wonder if that guy could still talk after singing like that  That guy makes big chocolates sound like Valby  That is the worst thing I've ever heard  That is truly titled correctly  The worst Jets song ever made  There you go  Yeah  It just makes you angry that somebody wrote something that horrendous 
[01:21:30]  And then actually handed it in  Yeah  Yes, Anthony?  Another little note on the Christina Aguilera video  Yeah  I'm watching a clip of it  There is no way she would have sex in some kind of a situation like that  If you notice  The door is open  The wind is blowing the curtains  And there's a third person  This isn't a hidden camera  There's somebody holding a camcorder right outside the door 
[01:22:00]  She's not even looking that way  Like, hi, I'm Christina Aguilera  Maybe I better watch when I take my clothes off in front of an open window or door  And the guy is zooming in on her  And moving the camera  Look at this  Look at this, Norton  I certainly will, Ant  Take a look with me  Yeah  Won't you?  Yeah, a little closer if you will  See, look  There she is taking her clothes off  And there's just somebody by the sliding glass door  With the camera  She never turns around  There it is  Now zoom  Look  Handheld 
[01:22:30]  Closer to the door  Now zooming in  Get out of here  Can you make it bigger?  That is really hot  I mean, nothing against the video itself  Oh, jeez  Look at that  What's that, Norton?  The answer to your question  Just keep looking  Is that a ballpark Frank  Popping out of the side of that thong?  Dude, I got like five and a half going  Look at that  There you go  I love it, meaty  Love it, meaty  He's looking  He's got his  He always puts his hand in his pocket 
[01:23:00]  And walks around  Like he's jingling change  But there's no change  I love it  Just thick  And like Mitch Green's face  Big and meaty and lovable  Mitch Green  Jason from Saddlebrook, New Jersey  Wow  Saying that's the worst jet song ever  Is like saying Hitler was kind of a bad guy  I'd rather have a plunger jammed in my ears  Than ever hear that again  Hmm  Whew  By the way, speaking of the Jets 
[01:23:30]  And sports in general  I want to give our new morning show  A little plug here in New York, Anthony  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, Scott Farrell has joined the morning team  And he's rocking  Very cool  We will be supporting this morning show  How long are they going to be around?  This combo  Well, this is part of the sports guy formula  They're worse than Minuto  When it comes to members  You've got to explain it  Explain it for the rest of the cities  Because it is pretty hysterical at this point  It is 
[01:24:00]  I swear to you  They are the Spinal Tap  Of radio  Spinal Tap?  No, it's Minuto  No, Minuto  Spinal Tap  There's been 47 people in this band  Over the years  Stubby peeps  Jeremy, the program director here in New York  Chris McLaughlin decided on this concept called the sports guys  Sports guys  Sports guys  We have had about 14 combos now  At least there has been different combinations of sports guys  There will be guys  Because there's got to be more than one 
[01:24:30]  Because it's sports guys  So they'll throw one guy out  And bring a new guy in  And then maybe throw out the new guy  Bring another new guy in  And then throw out the original guy  Right  And bring  There's no original sports guy in there, is there?  I think  Wasn't John Riggins one of the sports guys for a few days?  John Riggins from Washington  Was a sports guy  Yeah  He was a sports guy  He was a sports guy  And you take that with you  Like a president  You don't  No one calls you the ex-president  So it was Mr. President  Yeah  Mr. Sports Guy 
[01:25:00]  That's what he is  Scott and Sid  Sid and Craig  Sid, Craig and Blaine  John Riggins  Scott  Then Scott  Sid  Then Scott  Craig  John  Then Scott  Craig  Blaine  Then Blaine and Craig  Then  What about they forgot Eddie?  Eddie  Sid and Eddie  Oh, Eddie  Eddie  Look, there were so many people  As sports guys  I don't even know  I don't  I swear to you  I see them in the hall  I don't know who they are  I don't know who the sports guys are 
[01:25:30]  We don't say hi to sports guys  Around here  Because we know they're not going to be around too long  It's like when you're in combat  You're in the NOM  They bring in the new fish  You don't want to make friends with them  They're green  You know they're going to get shot  And you never want to catch a sport  What a great line out of Platoon  That we ought to dump out of  ISU not  You're going to be in a world of hurt  But the point we're trying to make here 
[01:26:00]  Scott Pharrell is doing mornings here  In New York  Yeah  And we're going to try to get him on our show  For the other cities  He's in your face  And I'm enjoying the listen in the morning  He's a mad man  And Blaine is doing a great job with him  Blaine  For you Buffalo fans  Yeah, he used to be a  You know, Rocky sidekick  Rocky and Blaine  Blaine is still a sports guy?  Blaine survived  Okay, alright  You learned something new today  I cannot keep track of the sports guys 
[01:26:30]  I'm sorry  I put on my assistant PD hat  And I told them that they need to change the name of the show now  To what?  Something that doesn't say sports guys  Yeah, that sports guy franchise  The sports guys franchise is not happening  So are they changing it?  It's kind of like the Ninja Turtle franchise  It's over  Scott, Sid  Scott, Sid, Eddie  Sid, Eddie, Riggins  Sid, Eddie, Riggins  Blaine  Sid, Eddie, Blaine  Craig 
[01:27:00]  Sid, Blaine  Craig  Blaine, Craig  Scott  Blaine  They're all laughing outside the studio  Alright  That's good  I know there's more combos  How many combos are there up there?  I'm sure  There were other people thrown in there  Oh yeah  I know that  I know there were more names  For the other cities  We haven't had a morning show  Here in New York  Since then  I have been here  Our morning show  Gets beat by stations  That don't even come in  Yeah  In New York  That was before  The whole Scott Farrell hire 
[01:27:30]  And getting Scott and Blaine together  Scott Farrell  I used to enjoy him  He was on Late Night here  In New York  On 660  The show was syndicated man  I was listening to him  When he was in Boston  When I was in Boston  Francesca didn't like him in the days  You know  I like that  That bloated bag of vomit  That's right there  I don't appreciate the guy neither  I can't appreciate anybody  That can say appreciate  So there's something interesting 
[01:28:00]  Happening in the mornings  Here in New York  So give it a listen there  Okay  There you go  We like these guys so far  Trust me  Scott Farrell will blow himself up  Eventually  But enjoy the ride  Until he does so  Okay  Self-destruct  Oh he's unbelievable  Somehow  He makes you and I  Look like saints Anthony  But in the meantime  Enjoy it  While it lasts  There you go  We'll be back with more  Of these really bad carts  From the back wall  Oh Anthony  A little over an hour away  From the 6 o'clock queef  Oh I can't wait 
[01:28:30]  It's a goof fit  You idiots by the way  A lot of people  Discussing our new format  On message boards  And stuff  And going  I can't believe  They're doing the 6 o'clock queef  It's not as good as  What's in my pants  And we're goofing  It's not a real  Well it is a real bit  For a while  Okay  And also  Maybe  Ozzy traffic today  Another bit we're trying out  I wish you'd take us out  With a little bit of that  Jets song again  Yeah  God that was good  I like that first one though  Because that got me dancing 
[01:29:00]  Yeah  The second one  I don't know  I like that second one  The second one  A little  God that is great  Alright well  We'll get some of that  Vocal stylings there  You did have better production  Bases  Alright we'll play this  To the hook  Alright let's hear  And even though  John Minnelli doesn't like  That we say this  We'll be back  After these  I can always remember

[01:32:30]  Has a formula  That it must follow  You must include  Players names  Little things they do  And of course  Done to a  Catchy  Yeah  Done to a familiar song  Something the fans  Can just chant  To certain areas  So the boss  Got all the production  People together  We were not a part  Of this  I have to say that  Over and over again  And this is what  They came up with  Hello  Ah  I guess we were  Disgusting already  Jet

[01:40:30]  We just wanted to get some info out of her  And she wasn't budging whatsoever  Sure  And then we had  No we can't say China  No we had China on  And we went at her  We kind of talked to her about the situation  Boy  Boy that's gotta be tough man  Was she in the studio?  No she was on the phone  She wouldn't come in  Well lucky for you guys  She better whip ball your asses  Well AAA  I'll be completely honest with you  When we found out we were gonna have China  She wanted to come in studio  But we wanted to ask some of these questions  So we said 
[01:41:00]  Maybe we'd be better off  If she called from the hotel  Because we are a bunch of pussies  When it comes down to it  Yeah good thinking  Yeah  You know she kind of made it sound a little bit like  And I'm sure you know  She's a little bitter  She made it sound like  The reason she was let go  Kinda  Sorta  Part of it  Was that  Her ex-boyfriend  Was sleeping with the boss's daughter  Was sleeping with the boss's daughter  Listen have you ever  Have you ever heard a woman  Break up with somebody 
[01:41:30]  And then not have a disgruntled story afterwards  Uh no  Yeah you know  You were absolutely right there  Just kind of goes with the territory  You know what I'm saying  Yeah  That didn't come into play though  Yeah I mean you know  Business is business  I got nothing to do with that  Yeah  You just kick ass  Hey you traded up my friend  Hey what the hell happened man  We heard stories of your injury  That made me cringe  Yeah I was  It wasn't good necessarily  I was on  On raw against  Jericho and Benoit  I was stone cold 
[01:42:00]  And myself against Jericho and Benoit  And when I went to  I went to hit Jericho from behind  And when I did  I just  Planted my left foot  Just like I would  You know  A million times  And just  My left quad  Just completely tore off  Of its insertion  And rolled up my thigh  His  Quad  Rolled up his leg  Yeah  Picture  You ever do that  With the shade  In your window  Where you pull it  And it goes  Yeah that's pretty much  It made that sound  And everything  Hey is there  Is that  Is there a video  Of that Triple H  Yeah  And actually  It really doesn't 
[01:42:30]  Look like anything  Right  Like when you  They show it all the time  In this music video  That they put together  And they highlight it  And stuff  And you go like  What a fairy  Yeah right  Geez that didn't hurt at all  And then you know  From there we kept wrestling  I went like another  Six minutes or something like that  I kept wrestling on it  Damn  Which probably wasn't  A wise decision  If you ever tear your quad  It's probably best  To stop all  Stop whatever you're doing  Yeah at that point  And so I kept going  And then you know  Two days later  I was getting it reattached  In Birmingham 
[01:43:00]  How do they reattach it?  It's kind of a long process  But they use sutures  And they drill holes  In your kneecap  Oh man  And they fish it through there  And they just keep  Running it through  And then it forms scar tissue  Over the sutures  And makes like a new tendon  How does it look?  I mean on the outside  It looks like my leg  With a big scar down it  I mean it's not really  A whole lot different  It's a little bit  Shaped a little bit  Different than the other one  But you won't be able  To tell on TV  No  My knee pads on  And stuff  You'll never be able  To tell  But it feels good now  I mean it was pretty bad 
[01:43:30]  For a while  I was in the hospital  For seven days  And then I was in a wheelchair  For a couple weeks  And then I was on crutches  For like two months  How do you get back  Into shape man  You got to get a little  A little pudgy  Well you know what though  I've always been  Into bodybuilding  And stuff like that  It's like a hobby for me  You know  And that was one  Of the things  I you know  I was just  I was like the trainer  That went away  To train for a fight  To Siberia  Or something like that  You know  I just went down  To Birmingham  And I did nothing  But rehab  And work out  So I'd just go 
[01:44:00]  To the gym  When I'd get done rehab  I'd start at nine  In the morning  And go till six  At night  Every day  Rehab  And then after  I'd go to the gym  And train my upper body  You know  Yeah  Had nothing else to do  Yeah I guess not  Why Birmingham  I guess they got  A good facility there  Dr. Andrews  Jim Andrews  He's like the number one  Orthopedic in the country  He did like  You name it  In sports world  He's done them  You know  Yeah I'm going to  Jordan  Yeah Jordan  All these guys  And his rehab  Crew was head by  This guy Kevin Wilk  And he's like the best  In the country  He speaks all over the world
