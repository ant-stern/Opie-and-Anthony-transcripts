<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a scathing critique of the "Sex and the City" movie, focusing heavily on the actresses' perceived aging and unattractive appearances.  Sarah Jessica Parker was repeatedly compared to Ruth Buzzy, and the hosts used vulgar language to describe the actresses.  Cynthia Nixon's sexuality was also a subject of discussion.  Listener calls further fueled this segment, with some sharing their own opinions on the movie.  The discussion then pivoted to a woman who fell overboard from a cruise ship, with the hosts engaging in dark humor and speculation about potential foul play by her boyfriend.  A caller recounted a similar incident on an aircraft carrier.  The hosts contrasted public outrage over New York news anchor Sue Simmons' on-air profanity with the far more graphic content routinely shown in news reports of disasters. The double standard regarding content on radio versus other media was highlighted.

The show continued with a discussion of Sue Simmons' on-air apology for her profanity, which the hosts mocked.  They then moved on to Remy Ma's cancelled jailhouse wedding and Papoose's failed attempt to smuggle a handcuff key into Rikers Island, leading to a discussion about conjugal visits.  Suge Knight being knocked out was also covered, along with speculation about the attacker.  This was followed by a contrast between an NPR reporter's calm demeanor during a Chinese earthquake and her excited reaction to Roger Clemens' return to the Yankees.  Other news items discussed included a man suing JetBlue for being forced to sit on the airplane toilet, the upcoming iPhone release, old gas pumps unable to register prices above $3.99, and a Florida man suing for a Speedo ticket.  The hosts also prepared a "Sex and the City" skit with their staff, promoted their O&A Animation Festival and Traveling Virus Comedy Tour, including a listener poll for the comedian lineup, and discussed Scorch's dog cage fundraising stunt, encouraging listeners to throw paint at him.

The show further explored reality TV, comparing the Kardashians to the Osbournes.  Kim Kardashian's sex tape, father's death, and mother's marriage to Bruce Jenner were discussed, accompanied by explicit commentary about her physique and the sharing of her pictures.  A radio game involving adding "in my pants" to TV show names led to more discussion of Kim Kardashian's sex tape.  A studio guest, Steve, briefly joined the conversation, drawing attention to his short shirt.  A poorly executed prank involving listeners Justin and Scorch and yellow paint was recounted.

A significant portion of the show featured an interview with Michael Sheehan, author of *Crush the Cell*, about counterterrorism strategies.  Sheehan discussed terrorism, counterterrorism measures, the media's role in fueling fear, government spending inefficiencies, profiling, and the long-term challenges of combating terrorism. This interview continued into another segment, delving deeper into Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, the threat of terrorist attacks in the US,  challenges of combating terrorism, specific terrorist attacks (London and Madrid bombings), the role of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and US relations with other Middle Eastern countries. Sheehan shared anecdotes and discussed intelligence gathering and the political complexities of counterterrorism, with the hosts interjecting with lighthearted banter about speeding tickets and firearms.  The hosts also promoted Sheehan’s book.

The show concluded with a discussion of Anthony's speeding ticket and an email from a frustrated police officer, Keith.  Further discussion of Sheehan's book, a humorous interlude about Jimmy struggling to open a can of tuna, and the "thingsyoungerthanmccain.com" website followed, leading to a debate about the website's accuracy.  The hosts manipulated an instant feedback meter and revealed more items younger than John McCain, including Plutonium, Mickey D's, Dick Cheney, and Mount Rushmore.  This was followed by a discussion of Steve's weight gain and personal struggles, including alleged childhood molestation, recounted with graphic and offensive language.  Listener-submitted "lines of the day" were reviewed with further sexually explicit and offensive comments. The show ended with a discussion of Cardscan and a crudely produced video mocking fast-food restaurant employees.

How fast did you get it up to?  180 miles an hour.  What's the matter with you, you idiot?  Cut the s***.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Attention.  Attention.  Attention to all potential radio listeners.  If you're a fan of Sex and the City, this program is not for you.  Go away.  Nothing to see here.  Go away.  Nothing to see here.  Or if you're a cast member.  Yeah.  You might not want...  Or if you're a cast member's husband, who was in a real cool movie back in the 80s. 
[00:02:00]  Don't listen.  We think Sex and the City sucks.  A lot of coverage.  A lot of coverage.  We didn't even prepare for our radio show today.  And you know, we like to joke and say, we don't prepare.  We just come in and, you know, we just make it up as we go along.  Wing it.  But, you know, we really do prepare for this radio show.  We work our asses off.  But today in the office, for the whole hour, we were obsessed with finding pictures of the Sex and the City crew. 
[00:02:30]  The big premiere.  Happening in London.  Oh, it was London?  Yeah.  Why didn't they have it in New York?  I mean, the whole freaking movie's based on New York City.  We had to sit through traffic where they closed down streets to film this stupid show, a movie about the show.  Yeah.  And they had the premiere in London.  Not that I even care.  But apparently they're doing that. 
[00:03:00]  No, we do care.  And then it's going to be in Germany.  We care for different reasons.  No, we care.  Believe me.  Yes.  We do care.  So we've been collecting all the Sex and the City photographs from the newspapers today.  Can't get enough.  There's a bunch of doozies.  The first thing I said when I walked in, I opened up the newspaper and I said, is this a joke?  Is the Sex and the City movie a joke?  Because it's...  These are four hags. 
[00:03:30]  Hags that are trying to pull off this sexy image.  Well, I'd say three out of four of that.  Kristen Davis.  Oh, wow.  Wait a minute.  What?  I'm going to start talking about one of these broads.  You got your tickets yet?  Did you go to Fandango there, Opie, and order them in advance?  It's tough to say that Kristen Davis is a hag.  She's...  The dark-haired one?  Yeah, I think she's...  She's probably the best out of the lot.  I think she's a bit youthful. 
[00:04:00]  But this freaking Sarah Jessica Parker, she hasn't been a sex symbol since L.A. Story.  Will you stop?  Stop with the Sarah Jessica Parker being a sex symbol.  She hasn't been a sex symbol since that TV show she was on.  Which one was that?  Oh, wow.  You're going way back.  Was it Silver Spoons or something?  No, it was something like that.  Because that's the name that popped into my head.  I can't remember what the hell it was.  Well, Sarah Jessica Parker, she wore an acorn on her head for the premiere in London.  Yeah.  It can only be described as a green acorn cap. 
[00:04:30]  It's an acorn cap, and then it's got, like, branches and butterflies on it.  Yeah.  And, man, they caught her on a side view.  And this...  Wow.  She looks like Ruth Buzzy.  I know I've been saying that for years and years and years.  But look at that picture.  That's Ruth Buzzy from Laughing.  Yeah.  She looks like Ruth Buzzy.  In a dress.  In a nice dress.  And then she wears this dress, because she's supposed to look sexy and everything.  And there's back fat flab.  Or whatever it is. 
[00:05:00]  Because she's not fat.  It's loose skin.  Is it loose skin?  It's just loose skin.  Yeah, because she's not fat.  She's a tiny little thing.  But the skin is losing its bounce back.  It's snap back.  It's snapping.  It ain't snapping back.  No.  So, yeah.  She's all over the place.  Her pictures.  But none.  None as horrific as Samantha herself, Kim Cattrall. 
[00:05:30]  I'm pushing 60, but I'm on the hunt.  This song makes me mad.  I can't listen to this and not get angered.  I don't know anyone who watched this show.  I never watched it.  But you couldn't watch anything else on HBO without it just invading your privacy.  Right.  You want to watch Sopranos or something. 
[00:06:00]  And on the next Sex in the City, oh, Samantha's going to be banging 20 guys.  Right.  Wow.  Because they're all after her.  Because she's so hot.  Am I to believe that?  Well, no.  She is so past cougar.  She's a puma.  What's a puma?  I don't know.  It's like an old cougar.  It's just a mangy.  A mangy cougar.  Just a mangy, old, has-to-be-put-down cougar. 
[00:06:30]  There's pictures of her now.  How long?  When did Sex in the City first air on HBO?  Dude, we were at N.E.W., so.  Yeah, it had to be.  It had to be 10 years ago.  Like 10 years ago.  Yeah, because Gary Wall was a big fan back in the day.  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  He actually-  In one of our sessions with him, he said, you guys should watch Sex in the City, because  it gives you a nice little overview of what New York's all about.  No, it doesn't!  Because the girls are out and about. 
[00:07:00]  Are they?  They're hanging at all the hot spots in New York City.  Sure they are.  And all the landmarks.  It would be good for your show, because it would give you just a good variety of what  this city's all about.  And it's just guys are all over them all the time.  Right.  They don't know how to keep it away from them.  Kim Cattrall was what?  I guess 41 or something like that when the show first started?  And that's pushing it.  I'm sorry.  Well, as far as being-  Look, let's be realistic.  As far as a TV show- 
[00:07:30]  That's called Sex in the City.  That's Sex in the City, and it's supposed to be like, you know, attractive, hot women  that are out and about and whatever.  Yeah, that's pushing it on television.  Yeah.  It's 10 years later.  Yeah.  She's 51 years old.  Well, she's admitting to 51.  Admitting to 51.  She's 50-flur.  That means she was 10 in Porky's.  She's got a little 50-flurf going on.  It's 50-flurf.  It is Hollywood.  Come on.  She's going to admit to 51. 
[00:08:00]  Is that brave to admit that you're 51?  How short from 51 is 69?  Wait a minute.  I owe you 18.  Oh, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Shut up.  I had to do it.  So she's like 50-flurf.  And she looks terrible.  I mean, it's just not...  And look, I'm not saying she can't do movies or television  or that a certain gentleman don't find her attractive. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  But in this situation,  in this situation where it's supposed to be,  she's Samantha the Sex Crazed,  ooh, one of the foursome.  Boy, I wonder how many guys she's going to bang in the movie.  Do you honestly think this broad is going to be at some Manhattan hotspot  and have guys just fawning over her?  Yeah.  She's got wacky eye that they get from facelifts.  If it's an Ethiopian bar, sure. 
[00:09:00]  Oh.  And when was that from?  That was...  It was from like 1986?  No, that's 2003.  Well, she's got the small boobies.  You know, they don't have as many problems.  Nice rack, though.  No, there's not.  She looks square.  Her boobies are square.  Boobies, listen to me.  Speaking of square...  They're square.  See, look what you did.  I don't like her.  You shut down the show by showing us nudity.  We're on a rant about this Sex and the City movie that premiered in London. 
[00:09:30]  And then you got the other one that isn't...  She's a lesbian now, so you can't even look at her anymore.  She's like...  Her girlfriend or wife or whatever is more manly than Steve.  And she's in this Sex and the City movie making a movie she likes men.  And then they...  Which one's gay?  I don't know anything about these people.  Cynthia Nixon came out of that closet a few years back,  and she's got a very, very, very butchy... 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's the girl in that relationship.  Oh, absolutely.  Her significant other likes to wear those Nantucket sweatshirts,  if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  And she's got the safe hair.  The mullet.  Because it's easy to take care of, you know, in the morning  when you're out and about doing your thing.  Of course.  And then Vogue.  Dude, this is all we're obsessed with today.  We don't even know what's going on.  I think there's like 20,000 people dead in China, whatever.  Well, all we're looking for is Sex and the City.  Sex and the City. 
[00:10:30]  And then Vogue has Sarah Jessica Parker on the cover of their magazine.  And listen to what the Daily News writes.  It's carrying big like you've never seen them before.  Legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz steams up.  She's steaming up, all right.  Oh, steams up the June issue of Vogue magazine  with some of the most seductive shots ever seen of Sarah Jessica Parker.  Stop it.  You're not getting the most seductive shots ever of her. 
[00:11:00]  Not at all.  It's not, you know.  I don't get it.  This is like a joke.  They're not a representation of what guys in New York find attractive.  By the way, the picture where it says it's steaming up the June issue  and the most seductive shot is Sarah Jessica Parker.  It looks like she's in kind of a really nice hotel room.  And she's pretty much, she's got her hands on the floor behind her. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And her legs spread in front of her and they're on the floor as well.  Yeah.  So she's holding herself up.  And she's got some kind of like cocktail dress on.  And Mr. Big there is in a chair with a video camera.  And he's shooting Sarah Jessica Parker.  And it looks like he's shooting right for ground zero.  Yeah, he's got the camera pointed right there, doesn't he?  Wow, that's hot.  Hot and steamy.  When she got on the floor like that, a crew came in to build a tent around her 
[00:12:00]  to have her put down.  And then she had to tell them, no, no, I'm Sarah Jessica Parker.  I thought my wrists are fine.  I was going to go with a teamster scaffolding joke to rebuild what has been  obviously damaged by time.  Isn't it funny?  They call him Mr. Big.  They're talking about his cock.  Is that why they call him Mr. Big?  I don't know.  Probably.  Is it?  And then at the London premiere, you could be just like the Sex and the City girls. 
[00:12:30]  We got some.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Who farted?  Was that Jimmy?  Wow.  No.  No.  Nobody?  The cloud hasn't come over here yet.  It might be my food pocket acting.  All right.  Anyway, you can't tell a fart from your food pocket.  Here's a problem.  I'm just keeping the food pocket bit alive on our show.  I took care of that a while ago, just in case you're wondering. 
[00:13:00]  So then Sex Goes Global.  They had the premiere in London.  And then you got four Bettys, four British Bettys, like trying to imitate the Sex and the City girls.  They're all holding what looks to be Cosmopolitans.  Oh, yeah.  And they're all there just like the Sex and the City gals.  Look, we're just like the four birds from Sex and the City.  Oh, yeah.  And just when you think that the Sex and the City girls look bad, the fans are even worse. 
[00:13:30]  You know what Sex and the City does?  It gives hope to like old broads because they watch and go, oh, I could do that.  And then they wind up sitting in a bar getting hammered.  Yeah.  And not one guy is coming up to them.  Yeah.  And then some businessman from Des Moines, Iowa is picking you up and, you know, just using you as a you-know-what throw you on.  Right.  There's nothing sexy about it. 
[00:14:00]  He just has to get the poison out.  The poison out.  Oh, it's just.  What was the other thing?  Oh, and then the Daily News also writes, Sex and the City, 17 days to go.  The countdown has to go.  We have to go see this movie.  You know that, right?  Do we?  Oh, look.  Now they're showing it up on TV there.  Good.  We get some moving pictures.  Look what she's wearing.  She is wearing something on her head.  She's wearing a bush.  That should be taken off by Oswald.  It's a shooting target. 
[00:14:30]  Why is she wearing an acorn?  I don't care.  I don't know.  Because she's so wild.  No, because if you know anything about Sex and the City, she was all about the fashions  and she turned on a lot of people, a lot of women out there to the latest fashions.  Did she?  No one's going to be wearing an acorn on their head, you dope.  I just want to know.  How do you know that?  Huh?  How do you know that?  It's just pop culture.  Is it?  Yes.  You sure about that?  Yes.  Yes.  I'm very sure.  You watched a full episode of Sex and the City. 
[00:15:00]  That's a damn good point, by the way.  She always had on nutty outfits.  Oh, she was the gal that just would wear wild stuff.  Don't you remember the one where they were looking for a nut?  You know what, that episode where not one guy will call and back me up, I know, but they're  out there and they know this point is true.  Guys will back you up, all right, if you know that show.  She was all about.  As you bite a pillow.  She was all about just wearing ridiculous fashion statements.  Was she?  Statements.  Yeah.  Yes.  Big bows and big oversized flowers on her dresses. 
[00:15:30]  Really?  Yes.  Oh.  I didn't know that.  I would never know that.  Honestly, God.  Look, man.  You got to, like, pay attention to stuff out there if you do a radio show.  You got to be on top of pop culture.  Hi, I need one ticket to the Sex and the City movie?  No.  You look familiar.  No, no, I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not Opie.  Okay, one ticket. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, one ticket.  I say we go as a show.  Oh, is that it?  It would be the greatest radio show the day after.  We will be so angry that we had to sit through this crap.  And the mole.  If we get to ruin it for people.  Can I talk about the mole on Sarah Jessica Parker's face?  Where is it?  It's not sexy.  Maybe it was sexy, you know, 10, 15 years ago.  It's not sexy.  You go to a dermatologist, they burn that crap off in seconds.  Get rid of it.  Get rid of it.  Yeah, there's like the Cindy Crawford thing. 
[00:16:30]  And I guess once you get older and they start popping out, looking like a cocoa puff.  They start getting a little puffy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's time to maybe go to the dermatologist and get it removed.  Look, I had a few removed.  Because, you know, you could get them removed in this day and age.  Yeah.  Get them off your face.  But it's like, you're not Cindy Crawford back in the day.  Back in the day.  Because she's having her own issues these days.  You don't want to be...  Yikes.  It's too close to the mouth. 
[00:17:00]  You don't want to be making out there and getting a bit...  Your tongue, like, goes over the mole and you feel that...  You feel like three hairs?  Yeah, you feel that one or two.  What is that?  Look at that mole.  Look at the whole package.  That's supposed to be sexy?  What is that?  I don't know.  It's Sarah Jessica Parker.  She's getting married, man.  To Mr. Big.  To Mr. Big.  I wonder if they...  I get it.  I wonder if they really get married or something happens at the last second. 
[00:17:30]  He trips over it, walking down the aisle.  The mole?  Yeah.  The mole.  Where he caves her back in.  She has to be in the hospital.  Yeah.  Cracks her pelvis.  Mr. Big finally hits her.  Oh, God.  E-Roc.  Look at that mole.  It's like Google Map.  He's going up on her face really close.  That mole now looks like the face on Mars.  Yeah.  It's got that same look to it.  Maybe you could do a little split screen. 
[00:18:00]  It's got shadowing going on it and everything.  The Sarah Jessica Parker mole and the face on Mars.  Look at the wicking that is happening with her lipstick, too.  Yeah.  Like, that comes from those pruny lips.  When you get to pruny lips and the lipstick wicks down the little rivers that are coming off of her lips.  Oh, it's like a dried-out riverbed.  That's what happens to the ladies when they get older.  Why would they make a movie like that?  Why would they make a movie like this where it's supposed to be that they're the hot women about town? 
[00:18:30]  You know, they probably should have made this movie ten years ago.  Ugh.  Ten years ago.  These dopes were sitting around.  The show ended on HBO, what, two, three years ago?  And these dopes sat around, like, trying to negotiate movie contracts.  Idiots, you're getting old by the hour.  Sign the dumb contracts so maybe you look kind of the part.  Makeup people just kind of went, oh, no.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:19:00]  Let's say hi to Psycho Bob.  Psycho Bob.  Could you just please stop?  Just put out a word, stop.  Please, please.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Chris in Boston listening on BCN.  Chris, what's going on, buddy?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hope you're absolutely right.  Root Buzzy reincarnated.  I've been saying it for years.  My wife loves the show.  And all it is is four women whining.  I call it douches in the city is the name I have for it. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Out here it's on at, like, 10 o'clock at night, you know, on HBO.  And I'm laying in bed trying to go to sleep, and all I can hear is Sarah Jessica Parker's whiny voice.  About how she's never getting laid.  About how everything goes wrong for her.  And it's just the worst show ever created.  I guess this is how women act when we're not around.  Is it?  It's kind of scary.  I try to ask my wife if that's the case.  I mean, when you go out with your three girlfriends, is this what you guys sit around and do? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  No, and she says, yeah, we kind of relate to it.  They talk.  Oh, stop.  You've got to be kidding me.  I'm saying there's not better things to talk about than just whining about the BS that goes on in a woman's life day to day.  And that's why it's so big with the women.  They just seem to relate to what the crap they're talking about.  Well, the headline here is these bras are nowhere near hot enough for a show called Sex and the City.  No.  Simple as that.  Right.  And the time was a bitch.  And, yeah, they should have made the movie years ago if they were going to make it. 
[00:20:30]  And get us more pictures because we're obsessed with this today.  Wally, Long Island, what's up?  Hey, Wally.  Yeah.  Yeah, listen.  I'm hoping Sarah Jessica Parker is in our trailer listening to this right now.  Yeah, well, we kind of did this rant back in the day, and Sarah Jessica Parker actually called our show  because, what, the guy that was working the movie trailer that day was a huge fan of our show,  and he had it on in the background while she was getting makeup for Sex and the City. 
[00:21:00]  And next thing you know, she called up our show and bitched us out.  She was angry with us.  She was angry saying, you know, you know.  You guys don't understand that people listen.  People listen.  And the people that you talk about could be listening.  And we have feelings, you know.  And we folded.  Oh, of course we did.  We just folded.  Well, then she invited us down to the movie set or the HBO set,  and Ant and I were going to hire male models, GQ models to go down there.  And they're like, let's see what you guys look like. 
[00:21:30]  Go down there, and let's see what you come down here, and we'll see what you look like.  It's like, okay, get two GQ models sitting down there as us.  Yeah, but the point is we're not.  Yeah, this isn't Sex and the Opie and Anthony show.  Right, we're not on the radio acting like we're two sexy guys.  Sex symbols.  You should be.  Oh, thank you, James.  We're not acting like that.  When you're on a show called Sex and the City, you better be damn hot.  Right.  Let's say hi to Josh in Boston listening on BCN.  Josh. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, me.  Hi.  Yeah, I just wanted to say that I think Jessica Sarah Parker, whatever her name is,  is probably the most unattractive woman I've ever seen in my life.  My chick made me watch that show one time, and Kim Cattrall had cancer in that episode,  and the whole time I was hoping she was going to die.  Yeah, Kim Cattrall, I didn't see that episode, sir.  Did they do that?  But I'm assuming while she had cancer, she was still trying to search out some man.  Oh, well, let me tell you.  Some of the doctors giving me chemo are just the hottest. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah, because that's what a doctor wants.  Right.  Some middle-aged cancer patient.  Thanks.  Wow, this broad's beautiful.  I went to medical school.  I can't keep myself away from her.  Wow.  Oh, my God, man.  Jesus, did they go that route?  Stacy, North Carolina.  Hey, you guys got to get their head of Carolina pretty soon, right?  Your name is Stacy.  Absolutely.  All right, bro.  You watched Sex and the City back in the day? 
[00:23:00]  You know, in my seat of an ex-wife, dude, I was young and didn't know any better.  That was one of the concessions I made before I knew any better.  Everyone's got an excuse.  That was, yeah, exactly.  That was in the past.  And, man, I hadn't even thought of it for years.  Now, all the movie hype and everything, and now I'm hearing, I'm going under two chills now.  I'm hearing it again.  Was it a funny show?  I've never seen it.  Was it a funny show?  It was.  No. 
[00:23:30]  It was enraging.  Really?  Okay.  Because it was just so not believable on any level that these broads had their pick of men.  I used to like Mr. Big.  I used to like him when he was on Law and Order, but now I watch Law and Order reruns and think how much of a dick he was.  Yeah, that is, I guess, the woman's point of view.  It's like what women like to think things are like.  Yeah.  And it's unrealistic.  So, 17 days to go before the big movie is out for everybody. 
[00:24:00]  That's great.  I'd have sex with him if my uterus hadn't fallen out.  Let's play that music all day long.  Oh, God.  When did they play this music in the show?  It's a horrendous song.  At the beginning.  This was the intro, yeah.  That's when I knew to change HBO, because I guess this came out.  When did this come on?  It was after something.  That I used to watch.  I think. 
[00:24:30]  Was it Sopranos 98?  I don't think it was that long.  Maybe.  I don't know.  But then this song came out.  I couldn't get to the remote quickly enough.  Get this off.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take our first break, but pretty much obsessed with the pictures that are coming out from this dumb movie.  Yeah.  We got to talk about Sue Simmons here in New York.  Oh, what a potty mouth.  A little potty mouth on Sue Simmons.  We'll see if there's any repercussions.  Gives a crap.  A news girl here in New York.  She's been on TV since 1980 or something like that. 
[00:25:00]  Probably even before 1980.  1880.  What?  1880.  Ba-dum-bum.  And a lot of outrage because she's cursed.  Hey, he gets his first crash.  Sopran gets a crash.  Oh, hold on.  Stop it.  She couldn't be that.  That would make her too old.  Yeah.  So I'm going to say that they airbrush every frame in that movie.  Every frame?  Holy Jesus.  Who's got that job?  Airbrush.  Who's got it?  Like you're sitting there.  Pfft, pfft, pfft. 
[00:25:30]  Every frame.  Only 5.2 million frames to go.  Yeah.  To get these broads looking sexy.  I'm just going to say they called in industrial light and magic too.  Yeah.  Well, in the last X-Men, they did.  In the last X-Men, they had that one scene where they had Charles and what's his name there?  The other guy.  Bill.  No.  Magneto.  Yeah.  And they actually did do that. 
[00:26:00]  They made them look younger.  Oh.  Because they were supposed to be years earlier.  Nice.  So it can be done, but wow, for an entire movie?  That was for one scene, and I can only imagine how long it took for them to do that.  Imagine four of these broads for an entire movie.  They're just.  Frame by frame by frame.  Some poor bastards sitting in front of a computer just going, oh, God.  Another frame of Kim Cattrall.  You know, the hot one.  All the fans start up on the computers he's using. 
[00:26:30]  Taking up a lot of processor power.  Oh, there they are.  They're everywhere.  They're everywhere.  Look at her.  Oh, Kim Cattrall's got the mole, too.  Yeah.  They all.  Oh, yeah.  That's what happens.  She's got the mole.  You know, the older you get, whatever mole you got on your body starts taking on a life  of its own.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  And they can snip that crap in seconds at a dermatologist.  She looks good.  That's Kristen Bell.  That's her.  Whoa.  That's her girlfriend? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  It looks like Ellen DeGeneres with really bad red curly hair.  It's red curly hair guy.  That's a guy.  How could she be a lesbian if her chick is a guy?  How does that work?  Does anyone know how that works?  Yeah, that's so odd.  Like, if you're a lesbian, but...  Don't you want a girl?  But your girl looks more like a guy than most guys out there, then are you really a lesbian?  I get confused with that stuff.  Yeah.  Very confusing.  All right.  We got to take a break.  China. 
[00:27:30]  They're saying 10,000 dead.  I'm thinking that number's way, way low.  And, you know, they're not going to release numbers.  No, they'll never know.  They're doing their own thing over there.  We'll talk about the earthquake next.  Sue Simmons being a potty mouth.  And other things, of course.  Yeah, things.  Things.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  O.P. and Anthony.  Good morning, O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:28:00]  There's a lot of interesting stories in the paper today.  You got a woman falling off a cruise ship.  Oops.  Another one.  I laugh because she didn't fall off no cruise ship.  It's our humble opinion that there was an oopsie that occurred.  Oopsie.  It's the best way to get rid of someone you don't like.  I don't know if anyone's ever been convicted of murder for throwing someone off a cruise ship. 
[00:28:30]  God, it seems like the best way to kill somebody.  Like the food.  They never find them.  Yeah, that's what happens.  Now, the latest woman, she's with some guy.  I guess her boyfriend.  And it's 45 miles off of Atlantic City.  So, you're in the ocean.  You're in the Atlantic Ocean.  And, oopsie, she falls overboard.  And then the guy reports are missing. 
[00:29:00]  Anthony, you've been on a lot of these.  Not a lot.  A few.  Yeah, a lot of cruises.  Actually, a lot, I guess.  Okay.  Isn't it kind of hard to fall off a cruise ship?  It is so damn hard.  You have to, on purpose, you have to throw yourself over the rail.  And then hope you don't, like, hit maybe a lifeboat or the walkway around the ship that's wider than the part that you're jumping off of.  You can't just fall off of these things, really, especially since it's not heavy seas or anything.  You don't have waves crashing over the bow. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And you really would have to, on purpose, throw yourself off.  Well, here's the story.  What he told me on the phone was she fell over the railing and fell.  Oh, yeah, this is the mom.  You know, I feel bad for the family, obviously.  But, come on.  Something's going on here.  I guess the boyfriend had to call the mom.  Yeah.  This is what you're hearing.  How long after did he report her missing, though?  Like, if they wait a while.  Three days.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  He says she fell over the rail. 
[00:30:00]  Right then is, like, right there is she falling over the rail.  What are you reaching for?  What are you climbing up on the rail?  You've got to say you don't know.  You just were separated for a while.  You were on the bowl, and you thought she was running on the ship somewhere.  Yeah.  Buy yourself some time.  Yeah, no kidding.  This is so suspicious.  All of these are suspicious.  All of them are.  Yeah.  What he told me on the phone was she fell over the railing and fell to something down on  a lower deck, and that he ran to try to save her, but she lost her grip and fell. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, that doesn't sound good at all.  Nice line.  She fell.  She was holding on to something.  He tried to save her.  So I guess right away he said, oh, she just fell over.  Right.  Or that's so he says.  And then she's holding on, and you think he's taking his, like, his sneaker to her fingers?  Yeah.  Just pounding away at her face.  That's probably the best thing to do is you throw someone off, then you wait, you wait,  and you wait, and then you run and go, oh, my God, they just fell overboard. 
[00:31:00]  That way, they're only looking around the area right around the ship at that time.  Meanwhile, you left her in the dust.  Are there cameras on the ships at all, though?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there are cameras.  All right, so you might have to just, you have to know whether the cameras are not.  Yeah, that's true.  When you do it.  But you also.  Well, if you're going to kill your spouse, you got to do a little work.  You can't just, like, you know.  You got to do your homework.  You got to do your homework.  You got to look around and see where you can see cameras and all that.  Go to an area where it is less populated. 
[00:31:30]  Make sure it's later at night after you had a few.  Maybe, was it the balcony of a room, perhaps?  A railing on a walkway?  Like, they don't give you enough details.  Philadelphia area mother is devastated.  Digesting the news, her 46-year-old daughter was the victim of a cruel accident at sea.  Mindy Jordan was on board the Norwegian Dawn cruise ship on her way from Manhattan to Bermuda.  Around 8 p.m. Sunday night, 45 miles off the Atlantic City coast, she reportedly fell overboard. 
[00:32:00]  See, they're saying reportedly.  Reportedly.  Because everyone.  She ridiculously fell overboard.  You can't get convicted for murder for a push.  That's almost impossible.  A push.  It's hard to prove.  You're right.  How would you prove that if there's no camera around?  There's no evidence left behind.  Your teeth prints in her knuckles when they find her.  Right.  And, like, your shoe print on her forehead.  It was helping.  Well, that's just it.  They never find these people. 
[00:32:30]  No, I don't have sharks get them.  Yeah, you know, little sea animals.  First they come, they pluck your eyeballs out, and you're just floating around there with no eyeballs.  And then they eat your lips away.  Mom, mom, mom, mom.  Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom.  You remember the, we did the story back in the day.  Some guy fell off an aircraft carrier.  And it was legit.  He was fooling around, and I forgot exactly the details, but he fell.  And he's in the water.  And he watches the aircraft carrier just going on its merry way because no one saw him fall off the ship. 
[00:33:00]  Can you imagine the fear of being in the ocean?  And there's the boat just going in the distance.  And no one knows you're missing.  No one knows.  You can't yell loud enough to get anyone's attention.  I was like, when is somebody going to figure out I'm missing?  Well, this guy, because he was, you know, he was a Navy guy.  He was able to survive.  He figured out some stuff.  Got some survival skills.  And like a fisherman's boat picked him up days later, something like that.  Did he have a boat or anything with him, like a light boat or nothing? 
[00:33:30]  Hell no.  He was just floating around the ocean.  He took his pants off and tied up the legs and the waist.  How do you tie the waist?  I don't know.  He actually crumpled it, I think.  And then he would blow air into one leg and hold that and use that as a float.  Yeah, you wouldn't have to even tie up the waist area, actually.  Because all you have to do is get air in it.  You know what I mean?  And the air would be above the water.  Yeah, you'd kind of still float.  Holes in the knees.  That would suck. 
[00:34:00]  He should have taken care of that.  He had to keep blowing up the leg of his pants every five minutes or something ridiculous.  But he did it, and a fisherman's boat came around, and the guy survived.  It was on like 60 Minutes or one of those shows.  It was an amazing story.  How happy are you when you see that boat show up?  Oh, wow.  Toodle-oo.  Oh, wow.  So the next clip here, more to the story that's happening today.  If you think that your life means anything. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  It means something to your loved ones and some friends of yours, maybe one or two co-workers.  That's it.  Yeah.  Outside that circle of people, your life doesn't mean crap to the rest of the world.  Nope.  This is a perfect example of that.  Listen to this.  Coast Guard choppers were searching for her from 10 p.m. to 3 in the morning, but no sign of life.  So you told me they didn't even find her body.  We have, you know, we want them to find her. 
[00:35:00]  We're still hoping that they find her.  Julie, they're not even looking anymore.  Cruise managers initially dispatched a small rescue boat, but after the Coast Guard arrived, the captain resumed his course to Bermuda.  Of course.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Da-da-da-da.  That's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, they make it look good, but it's like, hey, we got to get some Bermuda.  These people want to do some parasailing.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're sorry for the inconvenience. 
[00:35:30]  We're back on course to Bermuda, and remember to sign up for that Contiki cruise that will be taking the booze cruise tomorrow.  It's going to be a lot of fun once we get to Bermuda.  Don't mind the person that fell on board and died a horrible death.  Also want to remind you, it's casino night.  Casino night.  Yeah, go down to the casino.  Check out the band, too.  Really, really.  Got a great reggae band down there tonight. 
[00:36:00]  Try not to fall overboard.  We really want to keep on schedule.  You might notice the music's going to be a little louder tonight on the cruise ship.  That's to muffle the sounds of horror.  We want to muffle the sounds of crying coming from cabin 24-03.  So don't mind the louder music today.  This is fun.  Can I have one other one?  Uh, yeah, you know, I had a lot of fun.  But I went with a hell of a lot of people. 
[00:36:30]  I went with, like, family and friends and everything.  A lot of fun.  First thing we're going to do when we get to Bermuda is get rid of old buzzkill.  Yeah.  The party must go on.  Yes, we'll be dropping the murderer off at the airport.  I mean the, uh...  Oh, the boyfriend.  The boyfriend, right, right, right.  The boyfriend.  Yeah, you do a bunch of...  It's like you're, um, kind of taking your hotel room with you to various beaches. 
[00:37:00]  That stuff.  It's fun.  You didn't say rock coat this time around.  The rock coat.  That was Patrice's, uh, bit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I bought her a rock coat, man.  The rock coat.  Feeling hot.  Right to the bottom.  Feeling hot, hot.  People, you know, there's a horrible death.  People are, uh, in mourning.  Uh, let's say, you know, the guy didn't do it.  He's got to be feeling horrid.  Yeah.  And there it is.  There's the conga line.  He looks out his window. 
[00:37:30]  You know what, though?  Just these people conga lining.  As human beings, we're all the same.  Yeah.  All they had to do is get a few distractions on board, and it's, it's, uh, you know, business  as usual.  Maybe a few, a few drinks laying around for free.  That's it, right?  Some kind of limbo contest all of a sudden appears.  You're like, just get a distraction.  Oh, look at that.  You forget about the chatter that someone might have fallen, fallen overboard.  Did you hear somebody?  Oh!  Dirty banana!  Hey, who wants a dirty banana?  A dirty banana man!  Let me have one. 
[00:38:00]  Dirty banana!  Can you top it off with an extra shot of rum, please?  Oh, yeah.  What were you saying?  I forgot!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah!  Woo!  Hey, you gonna go see that Sex and the City movie?  Um, ugh.  Did you hear what happened on, on board?  Uh, it seems a woman.  Midnight buffet!  Woo!  Oh, my God!  Ice sculptures!  All right, chocolate buffet at midnight.  Woo!  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  So what were you saying? 
[00:38:30]  I, I don't know.  Let's go to the buffet.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  A lot of people checking in.  I mean, we got our expert in studio.  Anthony's been on a bunch of cruises, but a lot of people checking in going, look, I took  a cruise on, on that particular ship.  Uh, there's, oh wait, Pete might have more info.  Uh, Pete, Long Island, what's up, buddy?  The boyfriend.  She was getting lippy.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Good.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  How are you?  Hey, good.  Good.  All right, right to the point.  I was on that ship.  I gave my kids free reign on that ship to run around it, and I said, just don't climb 
[00:39:00]  up, because you'll fall off.  There's no way you'll fall off that ship.  Yeah.  It's just like, uh, there are kids running around.  Yeah.  There's no place on, on the railing that you could just, oopsie, and topple over the thing.  Unless you're drunk, and, and climbing over for some ridiculous reason.  But.  Yep.  I was, that was the first cruise I took with my kids, and I told my kids, they had free  reign on the boat, and they came back, so you ain't falling off that ship. 
[00:39:30]  So, you know, I think, I think you get probably people that want to kill their significant other,  or, uh, crimes of passion, where there's a lot of drinking going on on those ships, there's  a lot of hanky-panky, things like that.  So maybe, if this guy sees her, you know, gets a little jealous that there's stuff going  on, get back to the room, you crack her in the head, you throw her overboard.  How do you lug her body with cameras and other, what do you, well, I don't think there's cameras 
[00:40:00]  everywhere, especially in the rooms, there's no cameras on your balcony or anything like  that.  Do you get balconies?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Very nice.  Well, I did.  It's nice.  It's wonderful.  You have her do the Titanic thing, and then you just give her a push while she's up there.  Oh, on top of the world.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, now, now, let go of the rail.  Go ahead.  Just like in the movies.  Oh, this is so romantic.  I feel the wind in my hair.  I can't believe how romantic you've gotten on this cruise.  Dammit.  Oh, there it is. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Why don't we go to the bow, sweetie?  We'll go to the bow, me and you, and remember that scene from Titanic?  Nick, me and you will reenact it.  Are you kidding?  No.  This is wonderful.  It's the middle of the night.  No one's out here.  It's just you and me.  I really want to do that.  I think, uh...  Okay, there you go.  Now, climb up front.  Be careful.  We'd want you to slip.  There we go. 
[00:41:00]  Oh.  No, go up one more.  Go up a little higher.  A little higher.  No, I'm right behind you.  I'm right behind you.  I'm right here, sweetie.  All right.  Now, shut your eyes and spread your arms like wings.  There you go, honey.  There you go.  It's a little wobbly up here.  There you go, you bitch.  Bye-bye.  Oh, God. 
[00:41:30]  You don't know how to relapse, do you?  What's the matter, Iraq?  I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, uh, lipping.  Now, feeling hot, hot, hot.  Oh, yeah.  Well, of course.  See, the, the juxtaposition in the bit.  Juxtaposition.  You go for the romance, right for the romantic music.  A little romance.  A little word reader, actually.  All right.  Food reader.  Let's go to Michigan.  Lauren.  Lauren, what's up?  Hey, there.  How are you, Lauren?  You were talking about that kid that fell off the aircraft carrier. 
[00:42:00]  That was the America back in 95.  Okay.  Yeah.  I was on that ship.  You were?  When he, when he fell off.  Yeah.  What was the, what was the details?  Why did he fall off?  Was, was, was he, I kind of remember.  Go ahead.  He claimed he got hit by a, a door that was swinging out on what they call a sponsor and  little balcony.  But those doors on those aircraft carriers are about six inches thick steel, about 300 pounds.  Yeah.  That would hurt.  Yeah.  Did he die?  It was like an Adriatic. 
[00:42:30]  It was like two days that went on and they were looking for him on the ship before they  finally announced that he was, you know.  He was, he was overboard.  Well, the water was pretty warm there, wasn't it?  It would have to be.  Well, for a guy that was on the ship, you don't have a lot of detail.  He's just keeping it all quiet.  Yeah.  Like military secrets.  He went out for a long pass on the deck and.  Oh, you mean he was on the military ship?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A big door swung and hit him?  Nah, that's not how I remember. 
[00:43:00]  That's pretty clean.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  They say aircraft carriers are so big that you could be.  How big are they?  They say.  They're so big.  You could be on there with your brother and you might not see him.  I heard that.  I did hear that.  I've been watching that show Carrier on Discovery.  It's a whole documentary on that.  No, it's not about you, Jimmy.  Carrier. 
[00:43:30]  Pretty interesting stuff, though.  You know, there's like a lot of girls on these ships now.  Yeah.  And there's relationships going on and they're not supposed to, but they do.  And there's about 5,000 people on a Carrier, 1,000 of which are women.  So there's 4,000 guys, 1,000 women.  What a nightmare.  Whoa.  What a nightmare for both parties.  There's 5,000 and none, though. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, it used to be all guys.  Well, also, think about it.  From watching the show, there's probably about 200 attractive girls.  That's what I was getting at, too.  And 800 are just like, I think, lesbians and very burly women.  And they hook up, though.  Even the ugly ones.  I think it's a good place for ugly girls to go because there's a 5 to 1 ratio there.  Yeah, why not?  Be somebody, you hug. 
[00:44:30]  You're a 1 in New York, but you're an 8 1⁄2 on the high seat.  Exactly.  All right, one more story, then we've got to move on.  Lauren in Greenlawn, the home of Harborfields High School.  My God, my high school.  What's up, Lauren?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good, thanks.  Great.  I was actually on the Norwegian Dawn last year.  And this guy, he must have been like 68 years old, died in the casino.  That's a death ship there. 
[00:45:00]  What is with the Norwegian Dawn?  Yeah, he died right in the casino.  And we were about two days away from Bermuda.  Oh.  Yeah.  They just put him with the turkeys?  Now, Lauren, be honest.  How long were you affected by this news?  Five minutes?  Ten minutes?  I was probably a little creeped out for the first day.  For the first day?  Yeah, once I noticed that they didn't get a helicopter to the boat, I was like, there's  a dead guy on the boat. 
[00:45:30]  A dead guy on the boat.  That's a good point.  I was not fond of that idea.  That is pretty creepy.  That is a good point.  You know, somewhere on this boat, it's a dead guy.  I bet you they have a morgue.  You would assume it's probably way away from people, but it's probably in some freaking  room that they just, someone had a last minute cancellation.  Oh, you think he's like laying in the bed?  Yeah, put dead guy in that room.  I bet Jimmy's right.  I bet there is a morgue on board.  You think?  Like in the-  Like a freezer or something?  In the sick bay or something.  There's like a single drawer. 
[00:46:00]  I just figure, ah, just need one.  It probably just puts you in the freezer with the shrimp.  Yeah.  With the chocolate for the midnight buffet.  The ice sculptures.  You're sitting there with the dolphin.  Right.  And the swan.  Enough about the shrimp.  We get it.  How many people want a cruise?  How big is a cruise?  About 200, 250 people.  Perhaps more than that.  What?  No, you'll get about 4,000 people.  Really?  That many?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're huge.  Their ships are gigantic.  You can't even tell that you're in the water for the most part. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Unless you're, you know, outside and you go, oh, water.  That's right.  Unless you're falling into it.  I'm more a Royal Caribbean guy myself than a Norwegian, but I took one Norwegian cruise and  that was pretty nice.  I wish I had gone on a while with my girlfriend.  I never did that.  And now you never will or what?  No.  With that, we got to take a break.  Opie and Anthony.  We got some good instant feedback coming in on the Opie and Anthony show.  Army guy from Charlotte, North Carolina writes, ha ha. 
[00:47:00]  The women are an 8.5 on the Navy ship.  He liked that line.  We in the Army call that Baghdad beautiful.  That's good.  And then you got Bukkake Joe from Fort Riley in Kansas.  He writes, dude, imagine Iraq in the combat zone.  The ratio of girls to guys is ridiculous.  And any female who is normally a two rises to an instant eight.  And you would lick her.  Then you would.  Whoa. 
[00:47:30]  You would lick her.  Well, I could figure it out.  Well, he uses the word Sandy.  Blank out of sheer desperation.  Yeah.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  Sue Simmons.  She's a legend here in New York.  And I guess she's in trouble.  Is she in trouble or are they leaving her alone?  What do you think?  She'd be in trouble.  We would be.  No, we would be in big trouble.  We would be fired.  We would be fired.  But radio guys, we're just a bunch of scums.  As far as broadcasters go, radio guys are just scums of the earth. 
[00:48:00]  You know, you make a joke as you try to entertain your audience.  You get fired.  Yeah, you slip.  You slip and say a naughty word.  One slip and you're fired.  And they're fining you hundreds of thousands and throwing you out the door.  I think I told you yesterday, I've been watching the George Carlin HBO specials because I got the box set.  And the other day I'm watching and I'm thinking to myself, brilliant, obviously. 
[00:48:30]  He's one of the best ever.  And I'm thinking to myself, if he did some of this material on a radio show and it's FCC friendly, he would get fired.  Yeah.  Why is it okay on HBO?  Because it's under the guise that he's trying to entertain and be funny?  If we did his material, first of all, people would call us ripoff artists.  But we would get in so much trouble for the material he was doing.  Because of race and things like that and politically incorrect. 
[00:49:00]  Politically incorrect.  You don't mean the profanity stuff either.  No, that's what I said.  FCC friendly.  Yeah.  We could run some of this on the air.  We wouldn't get fired because it's George Carlin.  But if we did it, it's some outrageous stuff about religion and politics and, yes, politically correct stuff.  I'm like, why is it that we would get fired for that?  Because we would be doing the same thing, just trying to make people laugh as they go to work.  He can't be fired from being George Carlin.  That's another thing.  Those, you comics.  Well, the rules are fired.  You can't be Jim Norton anymore. 
[00:49:30]  The rules of radio are just ridiculous.  We have some weird responsibility when all we're trying to do is make jokes, get a little edgy.  Yep.  Entertain people, but it's just different.  Like Sue Simmons, she said the F word last night.  She's not going to get fired.  Nothing's going to happen.  It's just a good thing to talk about today, but she's not going anywhere.  That should be an FCC fine, though.  This wasn't done.  Why should she all just scream it?  If we all didn't have went through it, we'd be done.  Yeah.  We would be done.  You can't do an Asian joke on this station.  Nope.  You can drop an F-bomb and get away with it? 
[00:50:00]  Not allowed to do an Asian joke, and Amy Poehler did a whole Asian thing on SNL.  If we play that, they would dump out of it today.  Really?  The rules of radio are so stupid.  I don't know why.  So stupid.  I don't know why we've got these standards we're supposed to uphold.  Did you hear Sue Simmons' audio?  Yeah, we're going to get to that, but Anthony had a really good observation about the Sue  Simmons thing.  A lot of outrage in the papers.  It's on page two, page three.  Oh my God, can you believe what Sue Simmons did?  She cursed.  And right on the front page of the Daily News, buried alive. 
[00:50:30]  There's a woman that is underneath rubble in China from the earthquake trying to pull  herself out as photographers snapping pictures of her.  How about the photographer puts down the camera?  Maybe put the camera down and help the young lady out.  Or maybe it's a little too heavy for one photographer.  Yeah.  Give the guy the benefit of the doubt, but he's thinking Pulitzer right here with this  picture.  Of course.  But between the newspaper and the news itself, the news is showing plenty of dead people. 
[00:51:00]  I've seen more dead people on the news lately with all these disasters happening around  the world.  But they showed the earthquake footage and showed some people underneath rubble dead.  And then there's big outrage over the F word.  Now, what's more offensive?  What is more damaging for a child to see?  Do you honestly think it's more damaging for them to hear the F word or see dead people  in horrific positions, bloodied, torn apart, bloated, drowned bodies? 
[00:51:30]  The cyclone footage is really, really bad.  Horrid.  They're showing just a montage of dead people.  Bloated, drowned people is what they're showing.  And you don't think a child watching that is going to be more affected than if they hear  a word that you know they've heard around the house, at school, wherever.  They don't walk into school and go, boy, I had to avoid so many bloated, dead, drowned  people today. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  No, but you're guaranteed every day you're hearing the F word.  I know I did.  Going to school every day you hear it.  Come here, Anthony.  I want to you.  Right from my teacher.  It was just that's why in a lot of ways this country is so effed up, man, because we're  I mean, you can't show boobs.  Who cares?  It's a dumb boob.  We're such a nation of like just this prudish jackasses that we'd much rather have our 
[00:52:30]  children seeing dead people than hearing a curse or seeing a breast.  For God's sake, that flash of the Janet Jackson thing years ago.  How much of a tizzy did that start?  Holy good God.  And meanwhile, bad dead people.  Who cares?  Montage dead people.  Not not a quick flash like they did with the Janet Jackson thing.  Yeah.  Montage dead people.  Uptightness over sex. 
[00:53:00]  We've become kind of a joke around the world.  It's like America for a long time was this this real up.  There's this front runner in free speech and free thought.  But and like we have become like the running joke with how sexually uptight we are.  You know, it's a Europe laughs at us and they should laugh at us.  And I think it leads to sexual problems later in life because, you know, it's so taboo.  The sex thing in other countries.  Sex is not taboo.  You're all wound up and they don't got as many freaks walking around.  Even the filthy French. 
[00:53:30]  They love nudity.  They work eight hours a week.  They have nothing else to do.  My work week is over.  It's Monday.  Lazy bum.  I think I will go to the beach in my speedo.  Awful.  What's your bread eating zilchers?  Take your baguette and get.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I've been wanting a pot of scalding water so badly. 
[00:54:00]  Never wanted to be on a ship with you.  Goodbye.  So here's the Sue Simmons.  This was, I don't even think this was on live TV, was it?  She was like, but it was, but she was recording a promo.  She didn't know she was live, right?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It was during a tease for an upcoming segment.  Oh, so she was live.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I thought she was like taping in the studio, but they just happened to still be live.  You know how during a show they'll pop on and go, later on tonight, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah.  See, stupid me. 
[00:54:30]  I thought they recorded those in advance.  So they just pop in live.  I know.  Wouldn't you think they record those?  Why wouldn't you?  You have two hours to kill in between.  Well, what?  I guess they want to keep very up to date.  You know, what's the lead story?  Because they're probably putting together what their big story is going to be right up  until showtime.  Okay.  Yeah, but I mean.  No, believe me.  I take the whole news and go home.  Here's Sue Simmons dropping the F-bomb.  This is just unbelievable today.  At 11, pay more at the grocer, but getting less.  We'll tell you how to get the most. 
[00:55:00]  The f*** are you doing?  Wow.  Yeah.  I said, what the f*** are you doing?  She lost her mind, though, because if that was live, she's got to think that they need  a second or two to, you know.  It's a, what's his name that dropped the F-bomb there, Chien?  Oh, Arthur Chien.  Arthur Chien.  Same thing.  There's no delay there.  There's no, like, breathe, take a breath, and then drop the F-bomb, because what do they  think?  The mics go off the second you stop with your little promo? 
[00:55:30]  Wait for the floor director guy to go, and we're out.  Yeah.  And then, of course, at 11 o'clock, she had to do this.  We need to acknowledge an unfortunate mistake.  I love how the voice has to get very serious.  Yeah, what happened to the screaming, blurting out the F-bomb woman?  Where's the shrew?  Yeah.  See, we heard earlier.  It's still you.  You know, don't try to cover it up.  Right.  Just go, all right, you heard me.  I said it.  You got to get very serious, drop the tone a little bit.  And she almost sounds like she's apologizing for someone else. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Listen to it.  It was you.  We need to acknowledge an unfortunate mistake.  We?  How about you?  What's this we crap?  I'm a cameraman.  Right.  How about I need to?  We, the network, are all responsible for my filthy mouth.  We?  Potty mouth.  We need to acknowledge an unfortunate mistake that I made, and one of the teases we bring  to you before this program.  While we were live just after 10 o'clock, I said a word that many people find offensive. 
[00:56:30]  I'm truly sorry.  It was a mistake on my part, and I sincerely apologize.  Can I tell you something?  We're done.  You shouldn't say many people.  Not many people.  No one really does.  It's not many people find that word.  Not many people.  Offensive.  I said a word.  We're like children.  Americans suck.  I said a word.  I said a word that was bad.  Right there.  It tells you it's nothing.  I said a word.  What if she just said, look, I use profanity.  I shouldn't have.  Like, speak like an adult. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  It's like they get into this child speak when they address a slip up.  I said a word that a lot of, I said, that's just like a five-year-old boy's voice.  It's naughty.  That's right.  I said a word that was very offensive, kind of the way penis is to me.  This word may be to you.  It's just offensive, and you don't want to hear it.  Get it?  Elbow to the ribs.  We got it right.  But they sit you down, too, and they're like, okay, you got to look and sound very serious  with this apology.  All right, Sue. 
[00:57:30]  We're going to have to take care of this.  Now, remember, put on the serious voice.  If you make light of this, it's going to make it worse.  Right.  Like, oh, okay.  Once again, though.  At 11, pay more at the grocer, but getting less.  We'll tell you how to get the most.  The f*** are you doing?  I wonder who she was bitching at, in my opinion.  Yeah.  She went a little ghetto there.  Yeah, yeah, she did.  She went a little ghetto.  She went back to her roots right there. 
[00:58:00]  What the f*** are you doing?  The f*** are you doing?  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  But that was the big news tease.  How to get more at the grocers.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Food prices are going up.  Maybe she caught a glimpse of a mirror and was just cursing at herself for doing that tease.  What the f*** are you doing?  That's what you went to school for?  Yeah.  You want to be Dan Rather?  How long have I been doing this, S?  You think you're a bad ass?  What?  Do you think you're a bad ass?  S? 
[00:58:30]  A bad, um...  A badass?  Oh, badass.  Mm-hmm.  No.  I've been a badass.  I'm just asking around the room.  Who thinks they're a bad ass?  I know I am.  You do, huh?  Listen to this story.  And listen...  I am when I'm armed.  Give you that.  Pick out...  Pick out in this story...  Mm-hmm.  ...what got our attention.  Okay.  It's a game.  It's a little bit of a game.  This is fun. 
[00:59:00]  A little bit of a game.  Here we go.  Right?  It's a quickie.  Rapper Remy Ma's jailhouse wedding is called off after her groom-to-be allegedly tried to sneak a handcuffed key into Rikers Island for the ceremony.  Cratchit officials say that the key could have easily opened the restraints that are used in the facility.  The hip-hop star's fiancee, Papoose, who is also a rapper, has now been banned from the jail for the next six months.  Remy Ma is set to be sentenced today on felony assault charges.  She faces up to 25 years in prison. 
[00:59:30]  What catches your attention in that story there, Jimmy?  What jumps out at you?  His name.  The Papoose?  Papoose.  I like Papoose.  Or the fact that he...  He's the whole thing.  The fact that he's banned from a jail.  Thank you.  That is it.  If you think you're a badass, try getting banned from a jail for six months.  You're not allowed in our jail.  That is a badass.  You can't come to our jail.  That's pretty impressive.  Try to sneak in a key.  Huh?  Try to sneak in a key.  Yeah, you could get those handcuffs off pretty easily. 
[01:00:00]  What was he doing?  I don't know.  What was he going to do?  I don't know.  Big jail break.  I don't know.  Maybe we should have done research on this.  I don't know.  I don't think jail...  Maybe he wanted some help getting the poison out.  Yeah, a little handy.  He needed to get her free to do that.  Block those.  Wait, how long is she going to do in jail?  She's facing...  What did she do?  I don't know.  She shot her friend.  Shot her friend?  She shot someone.  She's really going.  She shot a friend of hers after a night of drinking at a club.  All right.  What's the biggie?  You shot me. 
[01:00:30]  Go to jail.  The friend is after her.  Yeah, they've had the trial already.  She said she stole money from her friend.  They had an argument, and then there was a shooting.  That ain't good.  No.  She's probably going to get 10 years.  Could be.  I think she was convicted already.  They're waiting for sentencing.  Probably 10.  Could face 25 is the max.  There you go.  Wow.  But the guy's banned from jail.  That's amazing.  I'm sorry.  You can't come.  Why would he marry her?  Why does anyone marry people in jail? 
[01:01:00]  You can't bang them.  What's the use of that?  That might be a love thing.  They might have conjugal visits.  Yeah.  Some of these jails, you get to, you know.  They're allowed.  Sure.  They hook you up in a trailer.  Oh, yeah.  It's like a little hotel room, and then you do your stuff.  I don't know how long it is.  Sometimes.  Some places, I think, is a weekend.  You spend the weekend?  Sometimes, yeah, depending on the...  You know, our country is just ridiculous.  You've got to take care of everybody, Ant.  We are crazy.  How are we allowing people conjugal visits in prison? 
[01:01:30]  I think some of these places that aren't as, you know, filled with violent criminals,  they get a weekend in a trailer.  Violent criminals?  She shot someone!  Well, that's Rikers.  I'm talking about in general.  She's not getting a weekend in a trailer.  But other facilities, I believe I've read or seen that, yeah, it could be up to a weekend  with your loved one.  God, that's sick.  Also for the spouse, too.  It's not easy when you're married to someone and you can't have sex with them.  Those trailers must have stains on the ceiling. 
[01:02:00]  Jesus.  How long has it been?  Malik from Asbury Park says six or seven years she's getting.  Wow.  Malik, right?  Six or seven?  Yeah, what up?  Yeah, I think she got like six or seven years because it was a mistake.  She tried to say it was a mistake, but what happened was, yeah, she popped her friend.  I know I'm dry sneaking, but she popped her friend for like $2,000, $3,000, and my man  Pat tried to sneak the key on the aisle, and he just got banned from the aisle altogether.  Why did he sneak the key? 
[01:02:30]  To try to get her out of there?  Nah, you know what I'm saying?  No cognitive visits.  So I guess he's trying to get a little tongue.  Cognitive visits.  Very nice.  Cognitive visits.  I recognize you.  Thank you.  Your visit's over.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Hey, Malik, what does the community think of Suge Knight getting knocked out?  Yeah, I feel sorry for that, too.  You're going to hear about a body coming up in a future week. 
[01:03:00]  Malik knows.  I guess the guy that knocked out Suge Knight, he owns a barbershop in the L.A. area.  And how tall is Suge Knight?  Like 6'5", 6'6", easily?  He's a big dude.  Well over 300 pounds?  This guy was 5'10".  Oh.  I bet you he was like an amateur boxer or something.  And knocked him the F out.  And TMZ, they're stupid.  Why?  Because they're kind of mocking the fact that Suge Knight got knocked out.  You've got to be dumb to be touching that.  You're going to get yourself hung out over a balcony.  Yeah.  Like vanilla ice.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  You're going to say something bad about Suge?  No.  Is that what you were going to do, Jimmy?  No.  I'm like, no.  I'm teasing, of course.  Bottom line is, anybody is knockoutable.  I mean, I would love to see the guy who knocked him out.  They have a picture of him up on TMZ.  He looks like a badass, man.  Can we see him?  He's got what a reputation he's got.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  I don't know if it's a good one.  For the short time, he's going to be alive.  I don't know.  You're going to kill the guy, but everyone knows he knocked you out, and you had to go  and shoot him.  That guy right there.  There he is up there.  You can see it on TMZ. 
[01:04:00]  Suge's most wanted.  That's the headline.  Oh, yeah.  And, you know, it'll never get back that Suge had anything to do with it.  Nope.  There'll be some weird accident that just happens.  He'll have an alibi.  No, it wouldn't even be a weird accident.  They don't go with weird accidents.  They make statements.  Accidentally got shot 30 times.  Exactly, yeah.  It's not like, wow, all of a sudden, like, his car went off a cliff.  And then no one says anything.  Yeah, no, this is, you're right.  It's handled differently.  I didn't see nothing. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  It's a chill here.  Do we have time to do the NPR, lady?  So there's this huge 7.8 earthquake in China, right?  Mm-hmm.  And this NPR woman is on the air, live.  And if you know anything about NPR, they are just a bore fest.  It's horrendous.  A lot of the cabbies here in New York, they love their NPR for some reason.  It's just monotone.  Monotone.  I think SNL did a pretty good skit on it where they just have that very soft delivery and  talk about mundane stuff.  Well, here's an NPR lady.  She's interviewing somebody.  That's not important. 
[01:05:00]  Then all of a sudden, the earthquake happens.  And listen how she handles it.  My position is to help my college or my pastors to pastor the church or to grow in the church,  to plan the church.  What's going on?  And the whole building is shaking. 
[01:05:30]  The whole building is shaking.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  We're in the middle of an earthquake?  The earthquake?  Yeah.  The whole block is shaking.  Yes.  The top of the church is falling down.  The ground is shaking underneath her feet.  And all of the people are running out in the street.  As we're standing here, birds are flying.  The ground is undulating under my feet. 
[01:06:00]  The cross on the top of the church is waving wildly.  And bricks are falling off of the ceiling, falling off of the roof.  Let's make this perfectly clear.  What a hold-it-together kind of gal.  Let's make it perfectly clear.  This isn't a tremor in San Francisco where they're used to this crap.  This is a 7.8 earthquake.  The top of a church is falling.  Oh, yeah.  The ground is undulating under my feet.  Yeah.  Wow.  I believe we're in an earthquake.  I know NPR has their way of broadcasting. 
[01:06:30]  But, you know, how about a real moment?  A little excitement.  Holy mother of F.  Just something.  A little excitement.  A giant bunch of rocks has fallen on me.  I'm crushed.  I'm crushed.  Things are going dark.  I feel cold.  I see the Grim Reaper.  She's just like the coolest.  You know, that Hindenburg guy should take a lesson from this woman.  Jesus, did he lose his mind.  She sounds just like one of the broads in that SNL skit.  Yeah.  With Alec Baldwin.  Yeah, yeah.  What were they cooking? 
[01:07:00]  Like sweaty balls or something?  Sweaty.  Sweaty?  Yeah.  His name was Shwetty.  Shwetty.  Shwetty balls?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Oh, very good.  Is that her?  She looks like she talks like that.  Yeah.  She looks like the chick from Airplane.  Julie Haggerty?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  She'll probably be rewarded for that.  Miss cool.  Keep it together, gal.  What does it take, though, to get this?  You got to start thinking, because all I was thinking was sexually, how do you satisfy  her?  Yeah, that's good.  Uh-huh.  Well. 
[01:07:30]  I don't really feel the bed undulating under my butt.  I don't look for anything.  I was going to say, where else could he go with that?  Yeah, but you're right, though.  She seems like a real prude.  Yeah.  If a 7.8 on the Richter scale doesn't move this iceberg, you're not doing anything with  a little spanking.  You have to pull her hair.  You have to tie her head to a horse, and then head in, watch the horse take off.  Any kind of reaction out of her? 
[01:08:00]  It's jaded.  All right.  We got to take a break here.  I think we go to break with a sing-along.  Club Soda Kenny surprised everyone, especially me, I guess, yesterday, because it was Burt  Baccarat's 80th birthday.  So Kenny decided to sing a song that actually was penned by Burt Baccarat and made famous  by the Carpenters.  Yes.  And he surprised all of us.  We had no idea he was going to do this yesterday.  It was just an unbelievable moment on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:08:30]  So we go to break with this.  Why do birds suddenly appear?  Every time you are near, just like me, they look to be close to you.  Why do stars fall down from the sky? 
[01:09:00]  Second verse.  Every time you walk by, just like me, they want to be close to you.  On the day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to create a dream come  true.  So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair and starlight in your eyes of blue. 
[01:09:30]  That is why all the girls in town follow you all around.  Come on, everybody.  Joke like me.  They want to be close to you. 
[01:10:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning.  Opie and Anthony, we go right to the phones.  John and Jersey, we kind of thought this after we did the bit, but John's on the same page  as us this morning.  What's going on, John?  Hey, John.  John, I want to give you a little credit. 
[01:10:30]  John, you there?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, man, what's up?  Hey, I think you ought to get a chick from NPR out of take a lesson out of Susan Waldman's  book.  Exactly.  Like, yeah, Susan Waldman had the over-the-top reaction to Roger Clemens coming back to pitch  for the Yankees last year.  Which, compared to an earthquake, 7.8 earthquake.  And the 7.8 earthquake where buildings are falling down around you.  And, boy, I think they should have switched roles there.  They should have.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, there's Roger Clemens.  He's in George's box.  He's a Yankee.  He's now a Yankee.  Posada, in the dugout, as I look in the dugout, I see smiling faces.  Yeah.  And then you got Susan Waldman in China.  Goodness gracious, of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Oh, goodness gracious.  A 7.8 earthquake.  The church is coming apart at the seams. 
[01:11:30]  Sam from Quincy is smiling because he knows.  Buildings are falling down around me.  And the birds continue to fly.  NPR lady goes, and the birds are flying.  Birds are flying.  Birds are still flying.  Land?  Well, yeah, of course.  They can fly.  They don't have to.  Earthquakes don't bother them.  Yeah, that's the safe.  Birds are looting.  That's what we're reporting.  Yeah.  That's the safest place for birds to be in the air.  Goodness gracious. 
[01:12:00]  People are being trapped under rubble.  Oh, this is the most dramatic thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, we missed the obvious on that one.  We're trying to figure out what the JetBlue thing is all about.  You got a guy, he's suing JetBlue for $2 million, I believe.  Yes.  Is that the total?  Look at this picture.  Doesn't he look like Roland?  Jimmy.  Hey, hey.  He really does.  Yeah, wow.  Hey, he wants to stop by.  Is he a good guy from JetBlue on the box set? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  We'll put the picture of the guy on onaradio.com later today.  Great, great website that does all sorts of good things for our show.  Anyway, this guy, I don't know his name, he's on JetBlue, and I guess he had a buddy pass.  His name is, it's really easy, it's going to flow right off the tongue.  Uh-oh.  Gokhan Mutlu, G-O-K-H-A-N-M-U-T-L-U.  What is that?  Horrendous.  Okay.  And, um, that was a real, excuse me, that was a real, like, that was a real Vaudeville 
[01:13:00]  moment.  What was that?  Not good.  Now we go into singing Friendship.  Yeah.  With a cane and top hats.  We stink.  This guy, uh, I don't know.  I was outraged at first, but then I, no, I wasn't outraged.  Who gives a crap?  But then we learned that he had a buddy pass.  What's a buddy pass?  Uh, let's say somebody you know works for the airline.  and they will have some type of sodomy with you. 
[01:13:30]  It's a pass with a hole drilled in it.  Oh, God.  A buddy pass.  It does sound so ugh.  Yeah.  If somebody works for the airline,  they could get passes for people they know  and friends and relatives and stuff and give it to them.  And they fly for nothing.  So you give them this buddy pass,  and you're able to get on the plane.  And he was going, what, San Diego to New York nonstop? 
[01:14:00]  It was a red-eye flight.  Red-eye.  And he was sitting in his seat 90 minutes into the flight.  He's out cold sleeping, and what, the stewardess says,  excuse me, you're going to have to move.  See, apparently one of the flight attendants didn't like the jump seat.  The jump seat is one of those fold-down seats.  They don't like one of the – the flight attendant didn't like it.  It's uncomfortable.  It was a full flight.  So she wanted the guy's seat that had the buddy pass. 
[01:14:30]  So you would think the guy with the buddy pass could just get up  and take the jump seat.  He's got a buddy pass, suck it up, whatever.  I don't know.  I think it's pretty inappropriate anyway.  The flight attendant, you're at work.  Sit in the seat you're supposed to sit in.  And it makes you want to scream.  Yeah.  It's like sit in the seat you're supposed to sit in.  What do they do on JetBlue?  Do they serve meals even?  No.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  It's just like drinks.  Snacks.  Stupid broad snacks.  Snacks.  They give you the blue potato chips.  They hand out the bags of blue potato chips.  Oh.  I'm kind of a fan of JetBlue for the short flights. 
[01:15:00]  Never put me on the toilet.  Yeah, if you like a toilet for three hours.  Well, no.  Never shoved me on a toilet.  I'm fine.  Yeah, they do encourage you to bring your own snacks and meals on the flight.  No first class though, Jimmy.  No first class.  I wouldn't know.  Yeah.  So they forced the guy to sit on the toilet.  Yeah, so they said, look.  For the remainder of the flight.  They said, look, you sit on the toilet because you can't sit in the jump seat  because only employees can sit in the jump seat.  So you sit on the toilet. 
[01:15:30]  Something's wrong.  And they made him sit on the toilet.  Something doesn't make sense.  The captain came out, he said.  Yeah.  He called him to go hang out in the bathroom.  You're lucky I got you on this flight.  He goes, it's my plane.  I'm in charge of this.  You have to listen to me.  I don't get it.  Something is wrong.  No one gets you on a flight and then wakes you up and goes, look, she wants to sit here.  Go hang out in the can.  Yeah, was she sick or something?  It doesn't matter.  I don't know.  Maybe she had morning sickness.  Maybe she, I don't know.  We don't have all the details here. 
[01:16:00]  And what about people that need to use the toilet?  Yeah.  He's got to get out so they can go.  And then he goes back in after like Jimmy's been in there after some yogurt.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  How about no seatbelt?  No seatbelt.  Yeah, there's no seatbelt on the toilet.  Oh, just hit some heavy turbulence and you come out.  Oh, just looking like you got hit with a malted.  Oh, you know what?  I bet you that they didn't land with him in the bathroom.  I bet you they said for a while during the flight.  And I bet you he got to sit back in his seat when he landed. 
[01:16:30]  It was probably just during the flight.  They tell you that you have to stand or hang out in the galley.  But again, what if there's turbulence?  Oh, then they probably would have said sit during turbulence.  Yeah.  That's just an odd.  How lonely.  How lonely in that little bathroom.  That would be terrible.  No, it's really irritating that they would do that.  The arrogance of that employee.  I'm thinking the guy smelled.  It doesn't make sense.  Maybe he smelled.  You think he was just farting a lot?  I think there was something going on where maybe he just, he was not a likable man, maybe. 
[01:17:00]  On his face, he does belong on a toilet when you look at his, his last name is Mutlu.  There's two U's in your last name.  You belong on a can.  That's my opinion.  We're going to keep on this story because there's something else going on here  that will probably come out in the lawsuit, right?  Pat Rumunaki.  He was in stinky class.  That's a typical Pat.  Thank you.  A couple of quickies.  iPhones are completely sold out online.  New version imminent. 
[01:17:30]  Yep.  So you can't even get the iPhone online anymore?  Nope.  New ones as you and I heard, right?  And what's going to be on the new one?  Oh, man.  It's going to have, I have no idea.  What's going to be different?  But it better be better.  I think they're going to go with the 3G.  The web browser, they probably, they couldn't have done this before?  Or is this the first time they could have?  Of course they could have.  They could have done this back in the 70s.  I don't know.  But I'm sure they had this technology.  Come on.  Yeah, but they want, they want everyone, every company doesn't want to sell something that 
[01:18:00]  people don't have to replace because then you're done.  Right.  Everyone gets it and then you sit back and go, okay, close the doors.  We're out of business.  The version that's coming out, I would assume, could have been the original one that came  out.  But that doesn't do anyone any good.  You put this unbelievable technology out there and you hold back some of the advances.  Yeah.  Let this sell nicely and then you kick them with the new one.  That's what our country's all about.  That's what selling products is all about in this country. 
[01:18:30]  I wonder if you can MMS pictures now.  Like you take a picture of the iPhone, you can't send it.  I hate the fact that I cannot send a text picture.  And AT&T is so bad.  When you get an iPhone, if I send Anthony a picture, which I have.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, by the way.  It's huge.  I told you.  Well, it was a smaller hand wrapped around it.  I like turtles.  And you get a thing that says multimedia message.  You have to go online and go to viewmymessage.com. 
[01:19:00]  That's unbelievable.  And then you open it and it's a little bigger than a postage stamp and that's the actual.  You can't click on it.  You can't click on it and make it bigger.  You don't save it.  You don't do anything.  You're able to look at it for a second.  That doesn't make sense.  You can't save it.  Can you?  Sure you can.  To what?  An actual postage stamp?  Well, it stinks.  You really can?  Of course you can.  You hit on a Mac.  I mean, I'll go a little inside the old Mac-a-roo here.  But there's a couple of buttons you hit and you can capture whatever's right there.  Oh, you know, I could screen cap things and save it that way. 
[01:19:30]  But there's no, like, it's just a screen with a stupid postage stamp-sized picture in the middle.  It's enraging.  And Verizon at least had an account.  Like, you'd open up your account and all your old pictures would be there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But no, AT&T doesn't do that.  They're terrible.  Well, I would assume the new iPhone will update some of that crap, right?  I don't know if this one will.  This one, I think the big thing is just the fact that the browser speed is going to be faster.  Internet that doesn't suck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are they going to have?  Huh?  Oh, it's going to be a little thinner? 
[01:20:00]  Better battery in.  Some of the new applications they open up will be trickling out over the summer.  Mmm.  Trickling.  It's basically nothing.  The iPhone, no one's ever picked up an iPhone and went, my God, that's too thick.  There you go.  That's not the problem they should be addressing.  Yeah.  I don't want to be able to, I don't want to, like, have it blow, like, if it's windy, have  it bend back.  How thin do we need a phone?  We act like we're all, we're all like little teeny spider monkeys with small hands.  I weigh 165.  God almighty, what a bunch of babies we are. 
[01:20:30]  That is so true.  God damn it.  It's very small, the phone.  It's very easy to match.  I don't need it thinner.  Let me MMS pictures and put video on here and web access that doesn't suck.  I want video.  And, uh, I, actually, I want a better camera, too.  The thing, you can't hold that, you can't hold it steady.  The way you have to hit the button to, um, take a picture leaves the phone dangling precariously  out of your hand.  Uh, you can't really get a good steady picture with it.  Yeah.  And there's no, uh, there's no, uh, flash. 
[01:21:00]  No flash.  No video.  You can't, uh, text them the pictures.  Oh, what the hell it is?  Why am I going to get another one?  Because we're dummies and we will.  I know.  I'm an idiot.  So am I.  With, with, with technology, too, where, you know, as soon as you get something, we can't  have it for too long before, like, all right, what's next?  I need a new one.  We need something new.  We need something new.  And it's thinner.  What did they discover in the last year that will make this little thin thing?  Right.  What did they remove? 
[01:21:30]  The giant chip in there is now a thin chip, which we didn't have a year ago.  This is all brand new stuff.  Happened in December.  Yeah.  They've had everything.  Of course they did.  They got four or five, I bet you they have four or five different versions of this that  they just slowly will put out in the next, you know, two years.  Did you put the old fat battery in all those phones last year?  We weren't supposed to do that.  Steve Jobs' phone right now is folded up in his wallet next to his MasterCard, the one  he's using.  Yeah.  So thin you can swallow it and make calls from your stomach. 
[01:22:00]  I don't need a phone that thin.  I really don't.  I'm not going to roll it up and smoke pot out of it.  Something else going on today.  This is very interesting.  Old gas pumps can't register more than $3.99 a gallon on their dials.  Wow.  They never thought it was going to go up that high, huh?  Creating problems for some stations.  Yeah.  Those problems will be for about two days.  They'll figure out how to get that freaking dial working properly.  When gasoline went to a dollar a gallon, they had problems with gas pumps because they would 
[01:22:30]  just do cents.  It wasn't a dollar thing.  Sure.  On the old, ancient gas pumps.  Like you said, they figured it out real quick.  By the time we read that story, they figured it out.  Fixed.  Are you kidding me?  Problem solved.  If it means more money for somebody, they're going to figure it out immediately.  And then you got this story.  This is not a story you hear about all the time.  A Florida man is planning to sue after he was kicked off the beach for wearing a Speedo.  Bob Heslewood, better known as Beach Bob, says he has been sitting just south of Bonita 
[01:23:00]  Beach for years.  No one ever bothered him or complained.  But recently, a Lee County deputy gave Bob a ticket for trespassing, saying his bathing  suit crossed the line.  A judge tossed out the case, and now Heslewood is suing the Lee County Sheriff's Office.  What a creep.  What's his name?  Beach Bob?  Beach Bob.  Beach Bob stinks.  Speedo.  I don't really understand the Speedo thing.  I think, um...  I don't really care.  Oh, I'd wear one if I was a little skinnier?  You'd wear a Speedo?  In a second. 
[01:23:30]  Why?  Why?  Look what I got, girls.  Exactly why.  The guy probably got all...  He got all excited, I think.  Oh, really?  I think the cop probably got a little excited.  Wrote him a ticket.  That usually, you know...  Oh, look at him.  What a sexy guy.  Oh, Jesus.  Is he skin cancer waiting to happen?  Yeah, Beach Bob is really tan.  Beach Bob's an ass.  You think Beach Bob, um...  I don't know. 
[01:24:00]  Likes the sun.  How could he not?  I think Beach Bob...  I think Beach Bob lives to showcase his genitals.  Beach Bob is attempting to make Saran Wrap Speedo.  He's coming out with the newer version of the Speedo to show off more of what he's packing.  Look, even thinner.  Thinner and smaller.  That'll be Steve Jobs' next thing.  It'll be so thin Beach Bob can wear the new iPhone.  Yeah.  Covers his helmet. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know if this is going to work, but Susan Waldman covering the 7.8 earthquake in China.  Oh.  What, Travis?  Don't yell it over you.  What I just gave you?  Oh, what is it?  Something different?  Yeah, this is actually her covering the 1989 earthquake in San Francisco.  Really?  Yeah, she was at the World Series with the Giants.  Oh, she really was?  Yeah.  So, this is actually what she would sound like if she was covering an earthquake.  Oh.  Let's hear it.  All right.  I just pulled it.  Good boy.  This is Gary Cohen in the WFAN studio.  There's been a major earthquake in San Francisco. 
[01:25:00]  Let's go out to Susan Waldman at Candlestick Park.  Susan, what's the situation?  Goodness gracious!  I'll tell you, this is as scared as I've ever been in my life.  This is an earthquake here.  It's good.  It's good.  Oh, reacting ass.  It wasn't that scary, especially because the World Series wasn't that scary.  Mm-hmm.  If you were under that pancake, it was scary.  Well, yeah.  This is as scared as I've ever been in my life.  This is an earthquake here.  A 6.8 on the Richter scale.  This upper deck was absolutely shaking.  The light stanchions were blowing back and forth. 
[01:25:30]  Phones have gone off.  All the power is out in the city of San Francisco and in the city of Oakland.  Everyone is standing around here.  People in the upper deck absolutely terrified to move, not knowing what to do.  Oh, I thought she was describing more of Roger Clemens.  Roger Clemens!  How funny is it that there is actual audio of her during an earthquake?  Or reporting about an earthquake.  At least she acts like you should act during an earthquake.  Yeah.  Your heart is moving.  Yeah.  Not the birds are continuing to fly and the church steeple. 
[01:26:00]  Wow, it just missed me as it fell to the ground.  Coming apart.  Out of the cadaver.  Not knowing what to do, there's supposed to be an aftershock.  Everybody from the New York media wants me to say to everybody,  well, all right, so far, this is a very scary situation.  Everyone is just sitting here to wait and see what happens.  Everyone's just sitting here.  Yeah, well, that's more.  It's very exciting.  Everyone's just sitting here.  Boy, is she a dolt.  What should everyone be doing?  We're waiting for George Steinbrenner to tell us what to do. 
[01:26:30]  My gosh!  ... sitting here to wait and see what happens.  6.8, they tell me, is a bad one, and I'll tell you,  yeah, the guy from San Francisco was nodding his head, oh yeah.  And right now...  That's not why he was nodding his head.  There was a lap involved.  And right now, there definitely cannot be a game at this moment.  There is no power here at all.  People are just glued to their seats, not knowing where to go,  because 50,000 people are not going to get out of this place all at once. 
[01:27:00]  Really?  So they're not going to be playing the baseball game?  They're not getting out all at once?  Really?  Glued to their seats?  Is that what's going to happen?  Eh, she's something.  She certainly does have excitement.  I bet you that.  I bet you they didn't.  I don't remember, because that's a while ago now,  but I bet you they didn't allow you to run onto the field  where that would be the safest place.  They'd probably force you to sit in the bleacher space.  Stay under the overhangs, please, people.  Stay under the cement and steel beams. 
[01:27:30]  You know how these ball teams are with their ballparks.  Yeah.  Compus acid.  Don't go on the grass where there's nothing above you that could fall on you and kill you.  Right.  What?  Getting out of here.  Oh, damn well.  They forced everyone to just sit in their seats as there's cracks all around them.  Yeah, things start cracking.  You're just feeling crumbs of concrete falling on your head.  Yeah.  The beauty of the O.P. and Anthony show, it's always a work in progress.  I would hope so. 
[01:28:00]  And there's 17 days before the Sex and the City movie premieres for everybody.  And we know there's a bit there somewhere.  We started the show by railing on the broads that read Sex and the City.  So Tim down the hall, he got Steve, the other Steve, Wood Yee Steve from the old days,  to do the prologue for Sex and the City.  So we're kind of working out our Sex and the City bits live in front of you all today. 
[01:28:30]  I love the Sex and the City.  This is our first attempt.  So you got Steve doing Sarah Jessica Parker's part.  Uh-huh.  This is how every Sex and the City started off.  Did it?  Yes.  I wouldn't know.  I wouldn't either.  Well.  Welcome to the Age of Uninocence.  No one has breakfast at Tiffany's, and no one has fares to remember.  Instead, we have breakfast at 7 a.m. 
[01:29:00]  and a fares we try to forget as quickly as possible.  How the hell did we get into this mess?  There are thousands, maybe ten thousands of women like this in the city.  We all know them, and we all agree they're great.  They travel.  They pay taxes.  They spend $400 on a pair of Monolo Balonics snappy sandals, and they're alone.  It's like the riddle of the Sphinx.  Why are there so many great unmarried women and no great unmarried men? 
[01:29:30]  I explore these sorts of issues in my column, and I have terrific sources, my friends.  Just like the show, I guess.  Just like it.  Exactly.  Probably twice as sexy.  We're going to hone it, obviously, but I think we're working on getting some real Sex  in the City scripts from the HBO show, and we're going to have Steve Woody, Club Soda 
[01:30:00]  Kenny, Roland, and somebody else as the girls.  Big A.  And maybe, I want him to be Samantha, because I don't know anything about the show, but  I know she's the sassy, sexy one.  All right, you know the players.  Oh, boy.  Who should be the sassy, sexy one?  Big A.  Really?  What about Club Soda Kenny? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, that would be cute, too, wouldn't it?  No, Club Soda Kenny should be Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yeah.  Yeah, they both got that head.  Roland should be the one that is now a lesbian.  Roland, do you think, should be that one?  Big A.  Kristen Bell is the quote, the cute one on the show, so I'm thinking Big A.  Big A?  It's Kristen Bell, yeah.  Davis.  Oh, Kristen Davis.  Kristen Bell is our other friend, yeah.  And then who's going to be a Samantha? 
[01:31:00]  Well, we need a real hoo-ah.  Yeah, because she's the hot one.  I guess it would have to be Steve.  Actually, him delivering those lines would be pretty funny.  Steve C., right?  No, would ye?  Oh, I think Steve C. would be good.  It could be Steve C.  But the problem with Steve C. is he overacts everything.  These guys are natural.  He can't naturally deliver lines, Steve.  He can't be part of our Sex and the City bit.  I'm acting.  He can't be part of it.  Yes.  He can audition, and we'll decide. 
[01:31:30]  I know I'm supposed to sound like this.  Right, exactly.  Steve does a bad imitation of everyone's imitation of Steve.  No.  And he thinks...  No, because what I'm trying to say...  Oh.  He's doing that because he thinks that'll diffuse the situation.  Not happening.  No, it doesn't.  Dumbbell.  And it doesn't.  You're right.  All right, we got our promo for our cuddle party before we go to break.  It's the first annual Opie and Anthony cuddle party.  Hugs.  Lace teddies.  Leather.  Boy shorts.  Alcohol. 
[01:32:00]  Hot, scantily clad.  Legal.  Teen girls.  Where no means yes.  And touching is allowed.  Ah!  Followed by long, scalding showers and tears of shame.  It's the first annual Opie and Anthony cuddle party.  Stay tuned for more details.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, let's not forget about the ONA Animation Festival.  June 5th, Roseland Ballroom here in New York City. 
[01:32:30]  It's a sold-out event.  This is very exciting.  We got a lot of animators out there animating old bits from the fine radio show.  And newer bits, actually, as well.  You can pretty much animate anything.  We just want you to keep it on the short side.  No more than what?  Two minutes, two and a half minutes tops.  Yeah.  We're going to feature the top animations on June 5th at the Roseland Ballroom.  Submitted by the fans.  We got cash prizes.  $10,000 so far for first, second, and third place. 
[01:33:00]  I believe it's going to be $5,000 for first, $3,000 for second, $2,000 for third place.  Also working on two live comedians to break up the animations.  Details, examples, and audio clips are on onaradio.com.  And for all the animators out there, you've got to start wrapping up and getting these things completed, and you must send them in.  Through the snail mail.  Snail mail.  We don't want you to email the animations in because we want a nice, high-res copy. 
[01:33:30]  Send a DVD.  Opie and Anthony Animation Contest, 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019.  I believe that address is on onaradio.com as well.  But time is running out.  We really need you guys to start handing in your animations, okay?  So we could start looking at these in advance and figure out how we're going to put the whole show together, okay?  Yes.  All right.  And also we're going to have more info on the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Is it going to turn into a tour, or is it going to be one and done? 
[01:34:00]  A one-off or a tour?  Who knows?  I think we're doing a couple of dates only.  We weren't going to do any.  We were going to take the summer off, but the PNC Arts Center down there in Hoomdel, New Jersey, basically said,  no, you guys can take the summer off.  You're good business for us.  So those tickets went on sale already.  Still tweaking the lineup.  I think what we're going to do, and we should have had this online by now,  we want the listeners to vote on who they want to see this year on the comedy tour.  Oh!  That's the angle we were taking this year.  Leave it in their hands, huh? 
[01:34:30]  Well, I mean, it's going to be a lot of the guys, you know, a lot of the regulars that you definitely want to see.  But then maybe there's some other comedians out there.  I bet Jimmy Norton's on that list.  I don't know if I'm going to be on the list.  I'll be on the show.  I don't want to see it if they don't want me.  No.  You'd be like the number one guy.  No, not necessarily, man.  Oh, absolutely.  They've seen me a couple times.  Hey, when are we going online with that, and what's the holdup?  We came up with this great idea last week.  It should be already done and ready to go. 
[01:35:00]  It should be on all the websites.  Club Soda Kennedy, you got info on this?  Yes.  What do you got, buddy?  The list was sent to the powers to be yesterday for approval before it can be posted on the website.  What approval?  Well, it has to be approved.  I mean, we have to say yes to it.  Yeah, there's a chain of command here.  I wish you were wrapped in it and thrown in a river.  Yeah.  We want to take you on a cruise ship.  So you're saying that the email was sent out but not responded to? 
[01:35:30]  I have no knowledge of that.  I was sent the email yesterday.  He's testifying every time.  Every time you ask him a question, he's testifying.  It's awful.  Stop sending me so many emails.  How about you put a couple of thoughts into one?  I'll send him something on two different points, and I'll get back two different emails.  Okay.  And then the next one, on it.  What's wrong with you?  Hey, he's got his BlackBerry.  He's loving his BlackBerry.  He's got a BlackBerry now?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Technology in his hands?  Yeah.  Where's the super duper executive producer, Steve?  Steve, when is this going online?  As soon as I get that list of the comics to put on the voting page.  But it went out less?  Not to me, it didn't.  Fine, whatever.  You guys do whatever you want.  Well, we have to make these decisions.  Let's pick the comedians and see who we...  Just...  Yeah.  Because if they do it, here's what happens.  If they do it and they don't clear it first, they'll get yelled at for that. 
[01:36:30]  Why don't you clear it?  Oh, wow.  Okay.  And then they send it to clear it.  You're like, what are you doing clearing it?  They can't win.  No one can win around here.  I know.  But no one's on the same page.  Steve, it's all like...  We're like an ant colony, and somebody kicked the freaking anthill.  We're all just, like, scattering, trying to get stuff done.  Go ahead, Kenny, go.  Your turn, go.  Certain people can delegate their authority and give the responsibility to somebody else.  Oh.  And who's that certain person?  Well, you know, this way, these certain people can just focus on being handsome and talented. 
[01:37:00]  God damn.  Let's say how to scorch.  We'll figure it out.  But take a look at all the Opie and Anthony websites, especially onaradio.com.  Hopefully, we'll have a list of comedians.  You get to vote who you want to see this summer on the ONA Travel and Virus Comedy Tour.  But tickets are on sale for the PNC show.  When is that?  I've got to make sure I don't take vacation on that day.  Yeah, that'd be kind of tough to explain.  I think it's in July.  I'm thinking August. 
[01:37:30]  Why are you screaming at me?  I'm not.  You're probably right.  August, right?  August 2nd.  Okay.  August 2nd at the PNC Arts Center.  Take us through ticketmaster.com.  My apologies.  There you go.  Our buddy, Scorch, he's up there.  And where are you, Scorch?  New Hampshire?  I am in lovely Manchester, New Hampshire, yes.  Manchester.  All right.  And has the day come where you're in that dog cage?  Yeah, I came in here yesterday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  And I haven't left yet.  I won't leave, obviously, like I said, last week.  Until I get at least $10,000 for the animal register.  So you're calling us from a dog cage? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, and my cage, I'll tell you what, my cage is probably two feet smaller than I thought  it was going to be, which is very interesting.  Of course, the heaters that they gave me, the warm stuff up, didn't work because they  blew the fuse, so it's working, though.  You know what?  Scorch.  But if you're going to be doing a hack radio, you can't have the comforts of home.  You can't have warm air being poured on you and stuff.  Before you go any further, who says I have heat at my house? 
[01:38:30]  These living conditions are better than what I usually have.  That's why I'm glad to stay here as long as it takes.  Are you eating out of a doggy bowl?  At least say you're doing that.  I do have pictures of all that.  Yes, I was eating out of a doggy bowl, and I will continue to eat out of a doggy bowl.  Scorch, what position are you in?  How are you in this cage?  The only way I can be, really, is either in a bad fetal position or almost like an L-shape.  I have my back up against the cage. 
[01:39:00]  I'm obviously sticking out the end of the cage because I'm just such a tall guy.  Wait, wait.  The cage door isn't shut?  The cage door is shut, yes.  But how are your feet sticking out?  Like I said, if I wasn't curled up into a fetal position, my feet would have to stick out.  Oh, I got you.  But rock101fm.com is the website.  If anybody wants to donate anything for the cause, I mean, you know, it's not going to benefit the New York animal shelters.  Hey, Scorch, the support must be unbelievable, huh? 
[01:39:30]  What's that?  Is the support unbelievable?  Oh, I just got it.  Yesterday was a great day.  We had the first lady that called up a great pledge of a thousand bucks, which was nice.  And from there on, you know, my goal is 10 grand.  I bet you I'm going to make that by today, I'm hoping.  By today?  Yeah.  I mean, I only started late last night, so I late yesterday afternoon, so.  And then I'm hoping I'll stay in there through Friday.  And my ultimate goal is I want to raise, like I told you last week, I want to raise, like, points.  And you're not getting out for those breaks, are you? 
[01:40:00]  Nope.  Not at all.  Oh, we talked you out of that.  Good.  He's sticking to it.  Very nice.  Someone's suggesting he gets neutered or euthanized.  I have a big sign on the front of my cage that says, O&A recommend you pee on me.  Oh, well, that won't really go through.  I want people to throw crap on you.  Let people throw paint on you.  No, it's okay.  It's all good.  But I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  Well, Scorch, we're going to have one of our listeners come by with some yellow paint. 
[01:40:30]  And it just means they love you.  So don't mind what happens, okay?  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  What can we give the first listener that throws paint on Scorch as he's in that cold?  Something from the prize closet.  Yeah, we got a great.  Do we have anything in the prize closet these days?  Why would we?  Oh, here's the prize closet.  Is this really the prize closet?  It sure is.  Before I tell you what's in the O&A prize closet,  I do want to remind people that we are broadcasting from New York City, 
[01:41:00]  the number one radio market in the entire world.  And we're syndicated to many, many cities.  And we're also heard, thanks to XM, in all of Canada and the rest of the United States.  XM fills in all the areas that we don't have a regular radio station.  With that said, this is what's in the O&A prize closet.  We got three Canon PowerShot digital cameras.  That's pretty good.  We got two Panasonic digital video cameras. 
[01:41:30]  Wow.  Pretty good, too.  That's pretty good.  And we got four $100 gift certificates in the O&A prize closet.  All right.  Those are to the sports authority.  Sports authority?  Mm-hmm.  So in the O&A prize closet, we have five, nine things.  Nine things.  They're pretty good, though.  A couple of them.  Boy, we haven't given away anything.  Nine things.  Four of them are gift certificates for $100.  I didn't even know we had that.  Me neither.  We should give something away. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah?  What do you want to give away?  I would say a camera.  How many megapixels?  All right.  Megapixels.  All right.  Scorch, where are you located?  Right in front of the Verizon Wireless Arena on Elm Street in lovely Manchester.  And before I go into further, if I can, I heard you mention Canada.  I got an email from an O&A fan named Trevor who listened to the show.  I knew.  All right, listen.  I so knew he wasn't going to get that out. 
[01:42:30]  First listener that throws some paint on Scorch, it's got to be yellow paint,  Scorch will win either a Canon PowerShot digital camera or a Panasonic digital video camera.  Wow.  And go.  All right.  And Scorch will probably be angry.  He'll be angry, but he will.  But he's in a cage, so he can't get you.  He will let us know that it actually went down.  What determines which one of those prizes they get?  Who would pick a camera over a video camera? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe someone that already has a nice video camera.  That's true.  Bob Kelly got a new video camera.  Oh my gosh, he's such a devoid of anything non-electronic.  He really is an idiot.  What did he do?  He's just trying to tell me, he's just trying to tell you on a camera.  Dude, it's so great.  HD, dude.  You're going to film yourself in the pool and sell it to Discovery.  Don't be schlub.  Schlub.  And the aquatic adopted zero. 
[01:43:30]  Bob was adopted.  He had to rub that in.  Of course I did.  Dude, why are you going to say that, dude?  Dude.  Invented he's Irish, too.  Yeah.  He's not Irish.  No.  No?  No.  I think there's...  Why?  Because his adopted family was or something?  Yeah, he's very naive.  Oh, stop then.  He's got to have some Italian and some Hispanic in him, I think.  Something else in there, too.  Something greasy.  There's something, at least a six-hour flight from here.  I don't know where.  It's at least a six-hour flight. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, let's check out the F.U. line today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.

[01:45:00]  Next message.  This is Josh from Pittsburgh.  I want to send a big f*** you out to Lisa from Long Island, who didn't think the dead  horse jokes were funny.  Lee!  F*** you!  End of new messages.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  Still lots to do on the O.P. and Anthony show.  We got Gary Coleman in Divorce Court. 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  This made us laugh pretty hard.  We got that piece of ass Kim Kardashian.  The dope and her sisters.  They did a PSA.  What does she do?  I hear her name.  I've never...  I have no idea what she looks like.  Oh, what's she...  Yeah, why is she famous?  Keep me up with the Kardashians.  What is it?  Yeah, it's another reality show that's trying to be the next, you know, Osbournes. 
[01:46:00]  Well, from what I remember reading on some of the celebrity blogs and all that stuff,  was that she was a friend of Paris Hilton's, and she wanted to be famous desperately.  So, she realized that Paris got really huge after she put out that sex tape, so she kind  of put out her own sex tape with that rapper Ray J, and it kind of worked, because now  she's famous.  Now she's somebody.  She's revolting.  God.  It's just weird, because her father died of cancer, and then what? 
[01:46:30]  His wife turned around and married Bruce Jenner, the Olympic hero.  Who was her father?  Anybody?  Kim Kardashian's?  Kim Kardashian's?  Yeah.  Kardashian.  Robert Kardashian?  Yeah, from the OJ trial.  Yeah.  Okay, that's all I needed to know.  Oh, is that her father?  Yeah.  As long as I know, now I know why she's famous.  Okay.  He died of, what was it, esophagus cancer or something?  Something horrific.  He died of God, saying, look what you did, look who you defended. 
[01:47:00]  He went like that, too, man.  Yeah.  Diagnosed dead less than a year later.  And then, so his wife ends up marrying Bruce Jenner, I think.  Yeah.  Is that how this goes?  Or were they divorced already?  I don't know.  Bruce Jenner looks like an old lesbian.  He's one of those guys that is turning into an old lesbian the older he gets.  He's had a lot of work done.  And then he's got these stepdaughters, these Kardashian girls, like, walking around the  house just looking ridiculously hot.  Yeah.  It's worth watching just for that alone.  I mean, they don't, it's all scripted crap. 
[01:47:30]  It's not real reality.  The Osbournes did, like, a real reality show.  They never did a take two, Sharon said.  It was just, that was what they did in their lives.  They just, that's why that show was perfect.  You know, they just filmed them being themselves.  And as they try to get the next Osbournes hit, they realize these people don't have what  the Osbournes had.  So they're giving them things to do and stuff.  Because Ozzy was a rock star on tour with kids.  I mean, and he's a very interesting guy.  It was just an interesting life.  But these other people, it's like, you're not that interesting. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Except for Hulk Hogan, he's getting divorced, his kid's killing people.  How do you not love the Hogan's?  Want to bang his daughter?  His kid's killing people.  Driving up and down like a lunatic, banging into the poles.  Her ass kind of looks big.  Not according to Danny.  Danny thinks it's luscious.  Big and delicious.  What was it?  Danny, you like that, right?  It is fantastically delicious.  Let me see it.  Let's pop up a picture of Kim Kardashian's buttocks.  If Iraq doesn't open a picture then. 
[01:48:30]  I know, Iraq, you're about to get just laid out.  That's her sister.  Where's her ass?  That's the sister?  That's her?  Oh, that's her?  It looks like her sister.  You're about to get one from the other angle.  Yes, on her ass at the front.  The hips are a little J-Lo-ish.  Well, that's how you could always tell when a girl has a nice one because you could see  the hips from the front.  Yeah, I like that.  I like the full bosoms.  I love the full bosoms.  They look like they're balloons filled with sand.  How much movement there?  I'm more of a behind man.  Yeah, me too. 
[01:49:00]  I like the behinds.  Love a nice juicy one.  Hold on a second.  I'm sorry to do this in the middle of our fantastic Kardashian.  I'm a shoulder blade guy.  Attention.  Attention.  Radio hack alert.  Radio hack alert.  Radio hack alert.  Yeah, we got a radio hack alert.  It happens.  Puddle of AIDS from Jersey writes, holy ass balls.  KTU, which is a station here in New York City, they're doing a bit right now.  People name TV shows. 
[01:49:30]  So you call up and you name a TV show.  And then the host or the person on the line has to add, in my pants.  So an example of this would be, a half, what?  Oh, two and a half men.  In my pants.  All right.  I get it now.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty good.  Are they beating us in the ratings?  Probably.  Are they beating us in the ratings with crap like that? 
[01:50:00]  Great.  What the hell's wrong with us?  Okay, now everyone starts playing.  Well, of course.  We got to play it now.  We got to see how much fun it could be.  So TV show.  So, uh, three's company.  In my pants.  In my pants.  Lost.  In my pants.  Holy Jesus.  This gets not fun immediately.  I disagree.  I find the fun is mounting.  Well, we need a list of freaking TV shows. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, what?  You need a list?  Oh, yeah.  Mash in my pants.  Right.  Nice.  There you go.  It was frightened.  All in the family.  Wow, look at that ass.  Screw the dumb hack bit.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'm with you.  Danny, I'm on board.  I like that.  She looks like she's squatting, though.  Well, she's bending over a little bit, showing a little crack.  She's got kind of boy shorts on, polka-dotted number, red, with black polka dots. 
[01:51:00]  And that's not even like, because that's kind of like the three-quarters angle.  You want a dead-on ass shot.  You know what you got to do?  You got to pull up the trailer for her porno.  Yeah, but you can't really do that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because there's a few shots.  Yeah, she's on the bed.  Have you seen the porno?  You know, I haven't.  I heard it wasn't so good.  Actually, you know what?  That's wrong.  I have seen it.  I think it's posted on a few free websites.  She's too good-looking.  What do you mean?  There's no such thing.  Bad angles.  I see a rapper tearing her up. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Is he a black guy, white guy?  Yeah.  I think Brandy's little brother.  I think that's who the movie is.  Oh, yeah.  Steve's walking in.  He couldn't possibly have anything on this.  Yes.  It's fake.  It's a nice dickie you're wearing.  Jesus.  Thank you.  How short is that shirt?  I know.  I washed it.  It didn't matter with you.  I washed it once.  Where'd you dry it on, Venus?  Why are your shirts getting smaller?  It's ridiculous.  I'm getting big.  I'm getting big.  My shirts are the same size.  But they're shrinking.  What?  It's like they're getting high. 
[01:52:00]  They're too high.  I know.  Put your arms above your head.  It's like a mid-rib.  I know.  Why don't you just kick one heel up with your pinky in your mouth and go, teehee.  You're dressed coily.  Thank you, Jim.  Shirt's too short, Steve.  Okay.  I'll get a new shirt.  The Kim Kardashian video sucks.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yes.  There's not one shot of a nice big **** anywhere in it.  Actually, if that was true, I would tell you.  Really? 
[01:52:30]  But it's handheld and it's very jumpy.  It's not like there was a cameraman shooting the whole thing.  The guy came over the line.  Thank you.  But, you know, we're trying to do it in my pants right now.  Now we'll take a look.  I can tell you this one.  She's on her stomach being jiggled back and forth and it was very sexy.  Here we go, guys.  Will in Dubrox.  Will?  What's up?  Hey.  I got one.  Smallville in my pants.  Oh, I get it.  This game is ponderous.  Hey, let's have a little fun.  Come on.  Chris, what's up?  He's looking at Kim Kardashian. 
[01:53:00]  I know.  Right.  Chris.  Hey, little Jimmy.  How I met your mother in my pants.  What are they, get this from Prep Burger?  I'll tell you.  They got this bit from Prep Burger.  That was an awful game.  That Robert Kardashian.  Yeah.  Boy, did God not like him.  Why?  Why?  It gives him a slutty daughter and a cancer.  Not in that order.  I mean, I'd rather have the slutty daughter than, you know, the big C, the big casino, Tony. 
[01:53:30]  But, wow.  See?  He defends OJ and look what happened to him.  A lot of the guys went down, huh?  His daughter, well.  A lot of cancer in that.  A lot of cancer.  You know?  Please.  Please.  At least Paris had the dignity to.  Yeah, you know.  But her, she had to.  With her.  You know, at least Paris.  Yeah, well.  You know.  It's not that bad because it was a.  Was that an ass shot I was seeing there?  Wow, she looks like she's miserable.  Of course she is.  Look at what's on her.  Right, Steve. 
[01:54:00]  Crazy.  Help.  We're on the radio still.  I know.  I'm just saying.  Erica in Raleigh writes, Opie while looking at Kim Kardashian.  Well, it's updated.  Was she a white girl?  Oh, yeah.  That's kind of sexy, actually.  I'm into the cuckold stuff.  Oh, God.  I can't watch that.  Growing pains in my pants.  Different strokes in my pants.  Father knows best in my pants. 
[01:54:30]  Deadwood.  Deadwood in my pants.  Who's the boss?  In my pants.  Is there a sitcom called This Bit Stinks?  Well, Kevin from Connecticut's got the best one yet, though.  Match game 76.  In my pants.  Yeah, let's go old school TV shows.  McMillan and wife.  In my pants. 
[01:55:00]  In my pants.  This bit.  Old McMillan.  Old McMillan.  I dream of Jeannie.  Millen and beard.  In my pants.  In my pants.  McMillan and robe.  It was so much fun.  McMillan and broth.  Stupid McMillan.  McMillan and friend to take care of my dog.  McMillan and bad news. 
[01:55:30]  Anyway, Kim Kardashian.  So, Kim and her sisters, they did a PSA for what?  Oh, my God.  For Burma?  Look at that dumper.  Yeah.  She's amazing.  Oh.  She's absolutely amazing.  I'd kiss her buttocks.  You like that?  I would.  Just kiss it, Jimmy.  It's juicy.  She's tainted.  I wouldn't care.  No?  Why is she tainted?  She showered first or hit a bidet first.  I'm just saying.  She's probably tainted.  Why is she tainted, Ann?  No, I'm just saying. 
[01:56:00]  Why would she be tainted?  Kim Kardashian and her sisters put out a PSA about Burma.  They are obviously truly concerned and take it very seriously.  That's what's written down here.  Uh-huh.  Listen to Kim and her sisters.  They're just terrific.  Until they open their mouths.  Exactly.  That's what we're getting at.  Put something in it.  Yeah, exactly.  What a happy music.  Thousands dead.  Is this, like, way too conservative? 
[01:56:30]  No, it's perfect.  Besides, it's a black tie benefit.  What's this benefit for again?  Burping?  Not burping.  Burma.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Thousands.  Hundreds of thousands dead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, too soon?  What?  Not burping.  Burma.  Making little jokes?  I'm just kidding.  I wrote my whole thesis on Burma.  It's a terrible situation over there.  Burma.  I know.  It's awful.  The corrupt military regime has control. 
[01:57:00]  Burma.  Huh?  First of all, it's not called Burma anymore.  Who watches this?  Well, this is a PSA, because you've got to get some help over there, but...  Eh?  They had her...  It's like a black tie, but I'm hot.  They had them say Burma because they can't say the real name.  Yeah.  Which is, uh...  Myanmar.  Myanmar.  Myanmar.  Myanmar.  Is that the H1?  Myanmar.  Uh, yeah, I think it's on one of those freaking channels.  Oh, I know.  It's awful.  The corrupt military regime has control, even though Aung San Suu Kyi's National League 
[01:57:30]  of Democracy won over 82% of the seats in the 1990 national elections.  How do I look...  Sexy.  Ryan Seacrest production, too.  Good job.  Even more brilliant contributions from him.  Yeah.  This guy's terrific.  Uh, they mentioned the government-sponsored rape in Burma before a cute joke to leave  on a high note.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  The Kardashians.  The sisters, anyway.  Is it too short?  Oh, it's a little too conservative.  Really?  I'm so kidding. 
[01:58:00]  Are you joking?  You girls realize that free Burma would issue an end to child soldiers.  And an end to government-sponsored rape.  Burma.  We're not kidding.  It can't wait.  Kim, did you really write your college thesis on Burma?  What's a thesis?  Right after child soldiers and rape.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  She's off my list.  Oh, boy.  We didn't need to see that.  She's high on mine now. 
[01:58:30]  We didn't need to see that.  Wow.  I didn't know she enjoyed touchy rolls that much.  Wow.  But how come she's not biting it?  Wow.  We didn't need to see that.  Oh, my God.  That was kind of cool.  That was very uncomfortable for everybody.  It looks like a poster promoting racial harmony.  Like the two hands shaking.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's difficult.  Why?  She enjoyed a good touchy roll.  It's just, I just, it's difficult.  I tell you, when I watch these cuckold videos where the girl is just enjoying it and taunting  the husband who's sitting across the room.  Oh, gee, the girls are so dirty. 
[01:59:00]  You like that?  They're so dirty.  You can't even.  They make the popping sound like this.  They pop it.  Someone just called KTU, got in on that hack bit and said, Opie and Anthony in my pants.  Oh, congrats.  There you go.  Let's say hi.  So what did you guys think of the Kardashian PSA there?  Pretty awful, huh?  Oh, it was pretty funny.  They're great.  They're helping.  They're doing things.  They're moronic.  They're huge stars for doing absolutely nothing.  Not their fault.  They didn't make themselves stars. 
[01:59:30]  This dumb country did.  Oh, wow.  That was close.  I thought you weren't going to say country.  Oh, no, no.  I thought you were going to blame some woman.  Well, let's say hi to Justin in New Hampshire.  Justin.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  So I've got some yellow paint.  You got yellow paint.  I've got some yellow paint, and I'm walking up to the Verizon.  I see the Rock 101 truck. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Give me that price on the list.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Justin.  Yes.  All right.  We're going to get Scorch back on the line.  No one sees you yet, right?  No, not yet.  Well, we've got to get Scorch out immediately.  Immediately.  Don't let him see you yet.  Immediately.  Yeah.  Hide.  It's a wide open area, though, so it'll be tough for me to refer to him to see anything.  I'm going to try to do a little distraction.  I'm going to keep you on one.  Yeah.  I'm going to keep you on the phone.  We'll distract him for you. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  You can go in.  How much paint do you have?  Why am I whispering?  It's like he's going to hear.  Scorch is in a dog cage for a few days, raising money for a good cause, I guess.  A quarter of a what?  Coffee cup.  Small coffee cup.  A coffee cup?  All right.  Yeah.  That goes a long way.  Yeah.  Just don't get it in his eyes.  Oh.  No.  Of course not.  All right.  Are we getting him on the line?  Very impressive.  As soon as I got Scorch, it's go time, okay? 
[02:01:00]  Okay.  But we're going to keep you on the line, so don't say anything.  I think we got him.  I think we got him.  Here we go.  Scorch.  What's up, man?  I felt bad, man.  I mean, we hung up a lot.  I don't feel bad about Scorch.  You don't feel bad.  That's okay.  I kind of feel bad.  We hung up.  We really want to know about that Canadian listener.  No, you don't.  Don't do it.  What?  Hang on one second.  Don't do it.  What's the matter?  What's wrong? 
[02:01:30]  So, what do you want to know about?  What are you saying don't do?  I'm talking to some people here from the station.  What are they?  I think I'm busted.  Yeah, is that sorry?  Scorch.  What's up?  We got a guy that's going to throw yellow paint on you.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, well, we got a prize in the prize closet we have to give away.  Give him a prize.  He said, can you tell him I did it?  Yeah, he did it.  Oh, we don't know.  That's what you do.  We actually do these things.  He did it. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, he did it.  So, anyway, what do you need to know?  No.  We got a little spot on this jacket now.  No, we don't need to know anything.  We wanted you to be live as we threw yellow paint on you.  Okay, I get it.  Okay, I get it.  Keep donating at rock101fm.com.  How's that?  Thanks for the plugs, guys.  All right.  Bye, Scorch.  That failed me.  And the winner is Scorch.  Yeah.  Yes, Scorch definitely won.  Justin, hold on a line.  We'll give you something. 
[02:02:30]  It ain't going to be a camera.  All right.  You're going to get crap.  Huh?  I said it ain't going to be a camera, though.  No.  Damn Scorch.  I think he must have people there looking out for him.  What could have happened there, Sam?  Do you think people are guarding Scorch?  Well, as I called, he already had gotten yellow paint thrown on him.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  As I called him, he was texting me saying, some guy just came up and threw yellow paint all  over me.  That's not true. 
[02:03:00]  But he said it before we said anything, unless he's listening there in his dog cage.  So he said he thought he was going to come on and talk about getting yellow paint.  Oh.  Hmm.  Well, maybe we have a winner somewhere.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I want documented evidence.  All right.  Well.  Whatever it is, the excitement is mounting.  Yeah.  It's just too much to bear.  We went with it.  It failed miserably.  What can I tell you?  Can I tell you watching that Kardashian with both hands full?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  What a good girl.  Wow. 
[02:03:30]  Well, what a surprise.  You're liking the Kim Kardashian?  Absolutely.  I am hating it.  She's a rich, spoiled rich girl.  It's great to see.  I can't watch that.  Give her a dose.  Jesus.  Look at that.  Two-handed.  You got to respect him.  I don't even know what his music is, but I'm a fan.  All you're thinking is the way her father looked when they said not guilty.  And now look.  Exactly.  He would be making that same face.  Oh, my God.  He'd be making that horrified look.  Like, what?  What? 
[02:04:00]  She's what?  With who?  It doesn't look like he's at full capacity, though.  It looks like there's a struggle going on.  Camera shy, maybe.  Really?  Either camera shy or maybe he's not turned on so much.  That's camera shy.  Wow.  She is.  You're right.  That's two hands.  She's a wonderful girl.  I'm now a fan.  A Louisville slugger grip.  Yeah.  Everybody loves Raymond.  Choke up.  No.  She's like Rod Carew.  Just slap single the way she's holding on. 
[02:04:30]  Jimmy, you like that right there?  That overhead view.  It's all right.  I mean, it's not a fetish of mine, but I got so bored with most porn that I just kind  of went into the interracial stuff because it was something I never liked.  It's almost like, where do you go from here?  Well, it's either this or goats and tall men and short women.  I mean, you know.  So I went into the cuckolding stuff, and I kind of like it.  But that will get boring.  Yeah.  Well, I kind of quit porn, but I'm trying.  Yeah, yeah.  You would get bored with stuff pretty quickly?  Dude, it's just.  Looking?  Yeah.  Picture yourself just naked diving into a cake and eating the cake until you're vomiting 
[02:05:00]  and still eating the cake.  You'd go, wow, I want something other than cake.  That's the way it was with pornography.  Wow.  Yeah.  It was, you know, I've stopped all that stuff.  You did.  Trying real hard.  Yeah.  It's difficult.  Trying real hard.  That's going to be a nightmare.  It's got to be a nightmare.  Good luck.  No, you've got to start feeling things, you know?  Yeah.  No, you don't.  You have to.  That's why we're going to go see Sex and the City, Jimmy.  Sex and the City.  We're going to go see that movie.  No, I'm not going to see it. 
[02:05:30]  For the show, we're going to see it.  That's about 88 minutes for the show.  I'm not seeing Sex and the City.  It's someone else's turn, right?  Yeah.  Did your therapist tell you that you had to start feeling real things instead of, like,  computer screen things?  No, I know that, though.  Oh, you do?  You figured that out?  Oh, yeah.  I'm awful.  I'm numb all the time.  Are you now feeling things?  A little better.  I'm very depressed.  See?  That's great.  So you're feeling depression.  Wow.  Wonderful.  That doesn't sound very healthy.  Well, I'm going through a breakup.  You know, you're supposed to be depressed.  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  You know.  Yeah.  Supposed to be.  Yeah?  And he's depressed, you know, because you've got to get it all out there.  What is it called?  It's emotional vomiting?  Emotionally vomiting, yeah.  Yeah, he's emotionally vomiting right now.  Let him be.  Yeah, it's depressed.  You get lonely a little bit.  It's a lot of regret.  A lot of regret?  Yeah.  Oh, that's something we don't want.  What's the regret, Jimmy?  You want to share or no?  No, I can't.  Just, I should have been better.  I don't think I had any regret.  Do you have regret, Ant?  I don't think I do.  Are you?  I don't know.  I don't deal with things.  I push everything down.  Let me tamp it down.  Really? 
[02:06:30]  Like a tamping rod.  Your emotions are like a musket.  Is that a musket?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Like a musket.  Just got to pack it down and make sure nothing comes out until it finally does explode.  It's not really, you're not really mad at that slow, older man crossing the street.  That's, you're yelling at the old man across the street because he's dad and he's drunk again.  Is that it?  Of course.  I don't think any of my stuff goes back that far.  Like, I really don't think that that much damage was done that long ago. 
[02:07:00]  That's the problem.  I just think it's like, everyone thinks that.  But it all goes back to our childhood.  I don't know.  I'm just thinking like.  The stuff you buried way, way inside, man.  I'm telling you.  Like, as far as a breakup goes.  Because I guess, look at this.  Me and Jimmy, we're commiserating through a breakup.  You know.  At first, it doesn't bother you.  Like, I wasn't bothered.  And I'm not bothered in a way that like, I have regrets or anything.  But it's like this whole, you just kind of. 
[02:07:30]  Well, that is a real big change of lifestyle.  You know?  So now you just kind of hang around going, eh, eh.  What do I do now?  Are you lonely?  I guess sometimes it gets lonely.  Sometimes Anthony's lonely.  Don't play this song.  It's sad.  I might start pulling a Jimmy and crying.  Fast forward like two weeks.  Me and Anthony are just nude under the sheets. 
[02:08:00]  Comforting each other in quotes.  Having our own cuddle party.  You got a wild imagination there, Jimmy.  That's a big step forward right there.  Yeah, we have an announcement to make.  We're ruling this show.  Come on.  Why can't it just be you're lonely and you go to a ball game together?  Why does it have to be naked?  It's got to be right into bed.  We don't even go out first.  Why does it go right to naked under the sheets?  How about a Yankee game together?  You know how good we would be?  What's up, Matt?  We're trying to yellow paint a thing. 
[02:08:30]  Matt, right?  Yeah, what's up, Matt?  Oh, all right.  We're on the roof of the Verizon building.  We have a ladder we got lined up there.  We have yellow paint and balloons, like water balloons.  We fill them up.  Yellow paint and a little bit of water.  We're about ready to throw them on Scorch.  Can anyone see you?  No way.  No one's seen me.  All right, get Scorch back on the phone.  I'm not even believing this.  I don't either.  Matt, are you lying?  No, I'm not lying.  I'm with my friend, Matt.  First of all, how do you get on the roof?  We have a ladder. 
[02:09:00]  We brought a ladder.  A ladder up on the roof of a what?  A Verizon building.  A Verizon building.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No one questioned you taking ladders and going up on the roof of the building.  No one saw us.  No one saw us.  Put it up there.  How did you get the water and paint in the balloons?  We filled a little bit of water first, then we mixed the paint in.  All right, let's see if it's real.  I don't believe it.  We're getting Scorch back on the line.  All right, when we start talking to Scorch, Matt, it's go time, okay?  All right.  All right, hold on a second. 
[02:09:30]  And we were in the middle of a real moment on the show, too.  I'm done with it.  All right, here.  Sergei here has talked to Scorch there, Matt.  You need the big ending today.  This could be it.  Why is Sam still talking to Scorch? 
[02:10:00]  Scorch.  What's up, guys?  We kind of feel bad that we're trying to get our listeners to throw paint on you.  No, that's okay.  You know what?  Like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  The worst part is that they didn't donate any money afterwards, which is all I care about.  See, I knew they were full of crap.  It's just...  A complete bust? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, there's no one.  All right, Scorch.  Next time, if you could, have them donate money next time.  All right, Scorch.  Thanks.  Enjoy your time in the dog cage.  Thanks, man.  Can we never go back to Scorch again?  Just never go back to Scorch ever, ever again.  I thought I was going to get a little therapy there.  Huh?  I thought I was going to get a little therapy there with the all-by-myself plan. 
[02:11:00]  All right, we got a couple more minutes.  No, no, I'm kind of, you know, I'm out of the moment.  You were brave?  You were ready to share?  I was ready to share a little, I think.  But you said now that the breakup is a little more difficult, even though you don't want  to go back there?  No, no, it was just that, and I think work on the...  Like, I'm having a lot of work done at the house, so it's not like I could have people  over like that, so it's not like I'm kind of in a limbo phase here, which kind of sucks. 
[02:11:30]  What do you mean you can't have people over?  Like, it's hard to have people over.  I know once, you know, the pool gets put in...  What do you mean, like, family, friends, couples, what?  Yeah, like anybody.  Why is that hard?  Something like, you know, chicks and stuff.  It's just something like that.  It's just one of, you know, this scaffolding in my living room.  It's just some kind of a weird situation where I feel like I'm not settled in, and then it  kind of gets to the point where you're like, you know, eh, and you got to deal with like  a breakup thing, which is a total change of lifestyle, because, you know, we're going 
[02:12:00]  out for a long time.  Yeah.  So you kind of get used to certain things, and then it's like, eh, well, so sometimes  I'll just shuffle downstairs to my refrigerator and open it up and look in, and then shut  it, because I'm not even hungry, and then just walk around, because I don't know what  else to do.  That's got it.  And I can't go out, because it's stupid.  You got to get up for work.  I think the big house doesn't help.  No, it'll help when it's done.  I know that.  You think?  Like, do you know what my summer's going to be? 
[02:12:30]  Just hanging out at the pool.  Hanging out by the pool.  But you got a big house that is perfect if you're, I hate to say it, but if you're like  either married or with someone serious, I know, or in a serious relationship.  It's very homey.  It's very homey.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you should probably, like, sell the house and, like-  No!  Get a big place here in Manhattan.  No!  It would be way more manageable, though.  I like a nice house out in the suburbs with a big pool.  Once it's done, it'll be great.  Get my fence up today, and then put the pool in, and then all the inside will be done, 
[02:13:00]  and then I'll feel like I got a people over.  And then it won't be so lonely.  Is it getting better?  Yeah.  It's just, you know, it's a change of lifestyle that you got to get used to.  So some days, most days, I would say, are like, fine.  But then there's an occasional day where you're like, eh, this kind of sucks.  Would you get serious again? 
[02:13:30]  Not in the near future.  But you're open to that possibility?  Eventually.  I'm not going to be, you know, 60-flurf, 70-flurf years old, just sitting there without anybody.  You just need some time right now.  Yeah.  I need time.  That's what I need.  I need time.  You need to feel.  No, I don't like feeling.  But Jimmy was right about that.  Feeling sucks.  You need to feel.  I don't know. 
[02:14:00]  Feeling is a little overrated.  Because I know Jimmy's just depressed.  He was saying that.  And I know what that feels like.  You just feel like, meh.  Meh.  What are you going to do?  Well, how do you get out of it?  You just let it run its course?  Time kicks away, and then you're out of it.  It's happened in the past, you know.  Is there any way to get out of it sooner?  Girls.  But like therapy or...  No, no, no.  Mother's little helper. 
[02:14:30]  No, no, no, no.  Little pill or something, nothing?  Eh, a glass of wine or eight.  You just got to let it run its course, I guess.  Yeah.  You just got to, you know, you get through it.  Move on.  Do you think the Sympathy Act will work with any of the girls?  Do you think anyone will be like, oh, poor Anthony.  I think you're doing just fine.  I don't know for sure, but I think you're doing...  Well, sometimes.  A-okay, my friend.  A lot of people would... 
[02:15:00]  A lot of people out there would love to be in your position.  You know that?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I know.  They would love to be single with a big, huge house and...  I'm happy to be me.  ...and race cars in the driveway and guns in the basement.  They would love to be you.  You make me sound a lot crazy when you describe me that way.  Having your pick of the litter, I would imagine.  Pick of the litter?  They would love to be in your position.  Oh, well.  I don't know.  What's the end game?  That's just it.  That's it, too.  What's the end game?  I don't know what the end game is.  Like, I was so used to being in a relationship that I don't know what the end game is. 
[02:15:30]  Is the end game another relationship?  And then you wind up going through that and like, eh, eh.  After a while, you're just like, eh.  Does it scare you to be alone, though?  It doesn't scare me to be alone.  I mean, right now, no.  But, I mean, as you get older?  No, it's not a scare thing.  It's a, you're not going to be happy thing.  You just kind of...  You don't think you can be happy by yourself?  I don't think so long term.  I don't think I can be happy by myself long term.  Wow.  I don't think I can. 
[02:16:00]  I'm learning something today.  Really?  I absolutely am.  Am I sharing?  I think it gives people around you hope for you.  Ooh.  Hope?  Yeah.  What the hell am I?  Some kind of goddamn psychotic ass?  There might be some...  Ass?  There may be some chattering going on around you.  Nah.  Oh, really?  That I'm crazy?  Nah, nah.  Who's saying I'm crazy?  I'll show you.  I'll show you crazy.  No, because I know you'll think about that all day.  No.  No, long term.  No, long term.  It's good to know that you have hope to get back into a relationship someday. 
[02:16:30]  I've been in one my whole life.  I know.  Not one, but a few, but they've all been pretty long term, steady relationships.  That's the kind of guy I've always been.  The last two have been very long.  Extremely long.  Between the two, it's what?  15 years somewhere around there.  Jesus Christ.  15 years.  What the hell is that?  In a relationship, right?  I want my new girlfriend to have just been born when I first got into that relationship.  So she has to be 15 years old.  Oh, boy.  I want a girl that was born on my wedding day. 
[02:17:00]  You want them to be younger than the Playboy Centerfold.  I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ.  Go with the Playboy Centerfold cutoff.  If they're younger than the Playboy Centerfold.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I haven't looked at the Playboy in a while.  Don't look at the ages.  It'll freak you the F out.  I don't even know.  Why would you look at Playboy?  You could punch up stuff so much better.  Right, Jim?  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  Oh, why did I just curse?  Because we're comfortable. 
[02:17:30]  Because it's after nine.  We're finally talking about what's going on in your head there.  So I'm thinking you're going to ride out the depression.  It's not a depression.  It's this occasional feeling of just not being a happy guy.  Okay.  I'm not going to start phezzing out over here.  Ronnie!  A little depression.  Ronnie!  A little depression.  You'll get through that.  I don't like calling it that.  It upsets me.  But that's probably what it is.  Can't you just be unhappy in this day and age? 
[02:18:00]  Everything's got to be depression or ADD or obsessive-compulsive.  You're not unhappy, though.  I've seen you.  You're enjoying your life.  It's just very different than what you're used to.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  For the most part, it's very enjoyable.  But then occasionally, you get those moments of just like kind of...  Maybe sadness.  You're thinking like, yeah, where is this going?  Where am I going to end up here?  What's the end game?  And that's what it is.  There is no end game.  So I'm kind of an end game guy.  I kind of like the security of... 
[02:18:30]  But you can't think that way.  It's easy to say, I guess.  Yeah, I can.  You just got to ride it out.  Wait until whatever happens, you know, end game happens.  That'll freak you out thinking about what's the end game.  The end game, you shouldn't even be worrying about.  You should just be living day to day and enjoying the hell out of the fact that you're single  and that there's an interest there.  Doggone it.  That's what I'm doing.  All right.  And invite me to your pool when it's done.  Oh, the pool should be done a couple of weeks.  Nice.  Yeah, very happy.  All right. 
[02:19:00]  What a cluster F at the end of the show.  I got obsessed with Scorch getting yellow paint on him and it just didn't work.  Stupid Scorch.  All right, guys.  We're off to XM.  You guys have a great day.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Why not?  In the world of Radio Shots, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice. 
[02:19:30]  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw.  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shots, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:20:00]  I want to be called the A-man.  Like you're the I-man.  I want to be the A-man.  How about I call you the A-H-man?  Don't get started again now.  Opie and Anthony.  In the middle of the night, I get an email from Eric that I read this morning when I got up.  That he's very, very depressed because his refrigerator door fell off.  It made a break for Opie and Anthony.  Stupid Australians.  This national hero got killed by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst, the worst show I've, this is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[02:20:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  XM Satellite.  Mike's on?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  XM Satellite Radio.  Where XM announced they have 9.3 million subscribers.  Really?  Yeah.  Ooh.  That's almost 10, I would say.  Well, when we started at XM, how many years ago now? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, God.  Three and a half years ago?  What?  Three and a half years?  Thank you.  Oh, there we go.  It was 2.2 million subscribers.  2.2 and now there's 9.  So we've added about 7 million, 7.1 million.  16 million?  We're responsible for 7.1 million subscribers.  Yes.  Yes.  Because that's how many more came aboard since we've been here.  Absolutely.  Obviously, we're responsible for all of them. 
[02:21:30]  We have a fine author.  Actually, I think this is your first book, right?  First one.  First one.  Congratulations.  Look at this.  How do you get one of these published?  What a book?  Come on in.  It's Michael Sheehan.  He wrote a book on terrorism called Crush the Cell.  How are you, sir?  How to defeat terrorism without terrorizing ourselves.  That's the key.  Yeah, that certainly is.  Because we're all a bunch of, you know, scaredy cats. 
[02:22:00]  Everyone gets very scared with terrorism.  The fact of the matter is, I mean, not to underplay any event, but the fact of the matter  is, relatively speaking, not many people, Americans, have died from terrorism.  No, that's right.  Terrorism is actually an instrument of the weak.  They kill innocents and civilians, and they want us to overreact.  And the fact of the matter is, now it's almost seven years since 9-11.  Al-Qaeda has had difficulty. 
[02:22:30]  And unfortunately, there's a terrorism industry out there that wants to keep hyping this.  And unfortunately, even though they sound like they're tough guys, they actually are emboldening,  emboldening, they're making Al-Qaeda stronger by encouraging that psychological reaction to  a next attack.  And so in the book, I talk about what the threat is, what it's not, what's a lot of  bullshit, what works and what doesn't work, and how to react if they do slip through.  They may attack us here in New York City tomorrow, but we shouldn't overreact.  And give them a victory they don't deserve. 
[02:23:00]  Well, Mike, didn't people say that after the 93 bombing, that it was like, you can't get  crazy, you can't start profiling, you can't do all this.  And then, you know, meanwhile, they were back to work, and they figured out a way to pull  it off.  But 93, and again, I go through this in the book, the 93 attack, we didn't get what  was happening in 93, that this was actually a movement.  Al-Qaeda attacked us three times in three years.  They blew up our embassies in 98, they blew up the USS Cole in 2000, and of course 9-11.  That's three attacks in 37 months, and it started, like you said, back in 93 with the 
[02:23:30]  first World Trade Center attack, and we just didn't get it.  Once we turned on them after 9-11, we've been able to really marginalize them, to keep them  under pressure.  If we back off on that pressure, they'll come back and kill us again in pretty substantial  numbers.  But if we keep the pressure on them with intelligence operations from the mountains of Afghanistan  to the streets of New York City, if we keep the heat on them, we're going to marginalize  them, but we have to stay focused.  And then, if they do slip through, to take it in context, don't overreact, come back 
[02:24:00]  at them, clean it up, arrest them, prosecute them, kill them if you have to, and then get  on with life.  So it's a balance.  The overreaction, though, usually comes from, unfortunately, our own media, who love scaring  us.  Boy, do they love to scare us.  The culture of fear.  We talk about it all the time on this show.  So how do you...  It's good press, you know, and I remember the Virginia Tech killing with this guy Cho.  He killed 30 people in about an hour. 
[02:24:30]  And the press just kept showing this guy's picture with his nine millimeters and his poses.  And the guy was a deranged little punk.  But he had these visions, and it was great theater.  And we played into it for a while.  And I was working with NBC News at the time.  And I told him, you know, you've got to take this guy's picture off of the grade.  And they did.  And they were actually...  They actually got a little bit more responsible.  Too late, though.  A little too late.  And I think they...  And they watermarked it.  Like, they claimed ownership of it.  They put...  Like, everywhere else you saw Cho's pictures, because it had been mailed to NBC, they had 
[02:25:00]  their watermark on it.  Yeah.  And I think they understood that was a bit problematic.  They had that mailed to them.  And I think they...  Right.  Again, as their credit, I think they understood later that, you know, they've got to be careful  about how you manage that.  They understood after they took advantage of it and got their ratings.  I mean, let's be honest.  Well, everybody else ran it, too.  Everyone else ran it.  Well, they're all guilty of the same exact thing.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's...  Ever since news became business, I mean, not so much information as it is business these 
[02:25:30]  days.  I mean, that's what you're going to get.  Sensationalism and...  Yeah.  And it's inevitable.  But what I try to say in my book is, there will be another attack.  And there will be great footage of it for news, because there'll be carnage and people  dying and buildings knocked down.  But I just ask that the terrorism experts, my friends and colleagues, get out there and  put it in a little context.  And remind people, it's been almost seven years now.  They have not been back here in the United States.  Why haven't they been back? 
[02:26:00]  Because we've turned our focus on to them.  I believe, by the way, again, in my book I talk about, that I believe that we have defeated  al-Qaeda or marginalized them.  They're not completely gone away.  With the assets we had in place on 10th of September, we have spent tens of billions  of dollars since then, in my view, on a complete waste of time and money.  We had enough assets at the time.  We didn't need any more of this spending.  In New York City, where I worked at NYPD, NYPD has a shrinking police force.  And Ray Kelly, the commissioner of NYPD, built a counterterrorism apparatus in New York 
[02:26:30]  City with less resources, you just make priorities and you get focused and you make it happen.  But the federal government is drunk on spending.  They need tens of billions of dollars, new bureaucracies, new buildings, and a bunch of  bureaucrats and contractors running around in Washington writing memos to each other when  the real work is done with CIA operatives in Afghanistan, with intelligence operatives in  the U.S., penetrating these cells with the undercovers and formats, just like you would 
[02:27:00]  a mafia operation.  That's how it works.  That's what people don't understand.  Like Hillary Clinton, she'll go in there and start yelling that we need more money now  for security here in New York.  And it's such crap because it looks good on the outside because, hey, she's our representative  and she's asking for money.  This is great.  We'll be safer.  When the truth of the matter is, no, like you said, the resources are there.  They just weren't being used properly, weren't in communication with each other properly. 
[02:27:30]  Uh, so yeah, that whole, the political end of it is never really, uh, even with what we  need, um, militarily, whether it's a covert, uh...  Exactly right.  I think if you measure someone's toughness on terrorism by how many billion dollar programs  they ask for, then you're really...  Why weren't the resources used, uh, properly on 9-11 then?  Because you said the system was in place and what went wrong? 
[02:28:00]  I just didn't get it.  You know, I write in my book about, in October, on October 17th, 2000, you had the third presidential  debate between Vice President Al Gore and Governor George Bush.  This is when they're running for President 2000.  It was five days after the USS Cole blew up.  Forty-foot hole in a billion dollar warship.  Seventeen sailors are dead.  They're not, their bodies aren't even brought back to, to Andrews Air Force Base yet.  And five days later, we're having a national debate on TV for the presidential debate, and 
[02:28:30]  the issue wasn't even raised by either candidate.  So this isn't something I'm, I'm not partisan.  I'm fiercely independent.  Bush didn't raise it.  Gore didn't raise it.  The press didn't raise it.  And neither did the audience didn't raise it.  And so we just didn't get it.  It was terrorism.  It was military, you think?  It was overseas.  It was something far away.  We didn't understand that these people were gonna, were gonna come to the U.S.  And the, actually, in 93, going back to what you brought earlier, the signals were there  that they were gonna come back to the U.S. 
[02:29:00]  So we were just asleep at the switch.  And on September 12th, we woke up and put the heat on them.  And with the assets we had in place, we've, we've done a good job.  You said, at one point, it says that there are many terrorist cells in America, and talk  about what that motivates them.  Suicide bombers, like in Jerusalem and all that stuff, I mean, it seems like that's a very  effective tool to really make a society uncomfortable.  And I'm wondering, why haven't, I mean, these 19 were suicide bombers, but why haven't  we had more of them, like, uh, like Christmas Rush Hour and Macy's?  Why haven't two of them stood at the entrances during a rush? 
[02:29:30]  It's, yeah, I know, yeah, it seems like a few dead people, a few dead suicide bombers,  you could do a lot of psychological damage.  It's the most frequently asked question and the best question.  And the answer is, is because there aren't that many of them.  Most, the suicide bombing phenomena normally exists only where there's a war.  Like in Palestine, where, where a group of people feel oppressed, uh, in this case by  the Israeli army in Gaza, or in Chechnya, where the Russian army is in Chechnya, or, or in 
[02:30:00]  Afghanistan, or in Iraq, where there's a war going.  In a peaceful place like the U.S., Western Europe, people just aren't really willing to  strap a bomb around themselves and blow themselves up.  And they don't have the infrastructure to help them get there.  It's harder to foster that type of stuff here.  Right, because you need the cells there to bring a guy who may be thinking about doing  it, but then you gotta, you gotta give him the psychological preparation, and you gotta  have the logistical sport to actually give him a bomb.  So, it's the conditions, uh, you need a certain perfect storm to get a young kid to put a bomb 
[02:30:30]  around him.  You need that wartime environment, you need the logistical sport to give him the bomb, and  you need that, that's, well, final psychological preparation.  Uh, they normally make a tape, they put the headband on, they stand there posed with a weapon,  and, and that kind of crosses the psychological Rubicon, now I'm ready, now I'm committed, and  now I'm gonna take a bomb into a bus.  And that infrastructure doesn't exist here. 
[02:31:00]  And that's why we haven't had many of these.  And, and that and just, just pure luck.  Yeah.  What about, uh, the, the end game?  What about defeating terrorism?  If we always have to be on guard, and we're always leery of it, then they're in fact working  because they are terrorizing us.  Uh, how does it end where we get back to those good old days of it just happens over there, 
[02:31:30]  and we don't walk around?  I remember, I remember walking around airports, uh, no armed, uh, uh, military personnel.  I mean, it was, uh, because it could never happen here.  Mommy goes right to the gate.  Yeah.  Do we, do you, uh, ever see us getting back to a point like that?  Not for a long time at our airports.  No, not for a long time.  And unfortunately, Al-Qaeda.  Well, the media's gotta change too, don't you think?  I think everybody has to, and Al-Qaeda is still a threat, and there's still a threat  to aviation, so it's gonna be a long time before we can-  You really think so?  Yes.  They would like to get back at us, so we have to protect aviation. 
[02:32:00]  I'm not sure we have to toss grandma upside down every time she goes through, but, and  so I think over time that'll loosen up a little bit, but not much.  I think that Al-Qaeda will be around a long time, and I hope that the American people, the  common person, kind of relaxes and lets this thing go off in the back burner.  But we can never, as counter-terrorism officials, ever lose focus on these guys.  A lot has been talked about with profiling.  There's a line, I think, with profiling. 
[02:32:30]  It's like, it's not 100% guaranteed, but I think it certainly helps.  Why is this, there's this denial that profiling is effective?  Well, it swings back and forth.  You know, we're here in New York City, and right now NYPD is under a lot of pressure because  of profiling of minorities in the streets of New York City, and a couple cops actually  tried to arrest an African-American chief the other day, and that causes, that's really  a problem.  That's a mistake.  So sometimes it's a pendulum swing.  You profile and you shake down Islamic-looking guys for terrorism or shake down African-American 
[02:33:00]  boys for carrying a 9mm, and you can get in trouble.  On the other hand, cops do know that there are certain patterns of who is conducting certain  types of crimes.  And again, it's balance.  As in everything else I talk about in this book, it's striking the balance between being  focused on getting terrorists, yet not hyping ourselves and hyperventing ourselves into  self-terrorism.  Where are we wasting our time?  I would say the creation of these huge new bureaucracies in Washington has been a complete 
[02:33:30]  waste of money.  The intelligence budget, by the way, and I believe in intelligence, but we're talking  about small numbers of operatives.  The intelligence budget is almost $50 billion a year.  We defeated the Soviet Union of $25 billion in our intelligence budget.  It's twice as big.  And it's just these monstrosities of bureaucracies in Washington, which I don't think contribute  at all.  And even I was in the U.S. Army Special Forces in Fort Bragg when I went down there to visit  a year ago. 
[02:34:00]  All I see is these new buildings going up with colonels running around giving PowerPoints  to each other.  The A-team in the field, which I used to be a part of, they don't care about that.  The more of those guys, the worse.  So I think what's happened since 9-11 is the Defense Department and the intelligence  communities have had a blank check.  Because if you vote against it, you're weak on terrorism.  Right, right.  And they're just building these monstrosities of bureaucracy when really the real work that needs  to be done, penetrating a cell somewhere in some mountain.  There's a couple guys with some creativity and some guts. 
[02:34:30]  And it doesn't cost a lot of money.  You just got to be focused, creative, and got to stay on it.  Doesn't Washington frown on covert operations?  I mean, obviously it's the best way to infiltrate some of these groups and get the intelligence  we need, but a lot of times you want, again, these politicians want to seem like they're  helping the people and, hey, look what I'm exposing.  This spending's going toward this.  And there are certain things that need to be secret.  No, exactly.  The irony of it is we love our movies.  We love Jack Bauer of 24. 
[02:35:00]  We love the James Bond movies.  But we don't want it to really happen.  We really don't want guys to do spying.  We don't really want them to kill terrorists, because when it happens, there's this huge  investigation, and they throw somebody under the bus, and a bureaucracy reacts very logically.  When that type of thing happens, they just crawl into a shell.  And the bureaucrats and the lawyers take over, and then you have a CIA and an FBI, which is  basically emasculated.  And that, I worry about the pendulum swimming back.  We need tough, aggressive, creative guys in the CIA and the FBI. 
[02:35:30]  And if there's an investigation every year because of wiretap controversy or something,  you wind up crushing them into oblivion.  Is the $25 million reward, it just seems like, I mean, that worked, I think, on Saddam,  and I think al-Zakari, I want to say, was given up for that.  But it's almost like with bin Laden, A, he's a billionaire, so the people around him know  he's got more money than any reward they're going to get.  And there's like this religious fanaticism, which attaches people to him.  Is that probably not going to get us bin Laden's? 
[02:36:00]  Sometimes rewards work.  Ramzi Youssef, the bomber of the 93 World Trade Center, was turned in for a reward in Pakistan.  So sometimes it works.  In bin Laden's case, it will not work.  He is up with those tribes, very isolated, in the middle of the mountains in Pakistan.  They don't even know about the rewards.  It probably won't work.  He's got layers of protection.  He's buried out there.  The way we're going to catch bin Laden, and we really do need to get him and his sidekick,  Zawahiri, is with an intelligence operation. 
[02:36:30]  We need to penetrate that organization, send an informant, just like up through the mafia.  You arrest the petty drug seller or mafia guy.  You turn them.  You send them back up the organization.  So you use that type of penetration, an informant or an undercover.  You zero on his location.  You signals intelligence.  Listen to their phones.  You vector in.  You find them.  Run some operations.  Hopefully, one day, you get lucky, and you take them out.  You hit a building, maybe, that they're in, like the way they got.  The number three guy, the famous number three guy of Al-Qaeda, which I would love to get 
[02:37:00]  a piece of that life insurance policy on those guys, because we kill them on a regular basis.  It's a good news story.  A lot of people say, oh, you know, our intelligence agencies are making that up.  No, and I think it's true.  The number three Al-Qaeda guy who comes out and starts operating.  Yeah, who wants to be that guy?  We find him and bomb him.  It's always the number three guy, yeah.  Didn't they just not get this guy, though?  I heard they didn't get Al-Zakawi's guy.  Well, they got the wrong name.  That's a guy in Iraq.  They thought they had him.  They didn't have him. 
[02:37:30]  Right.  They still need to go after that guy.  He's the Al-Qaeda leader in Iraq.  Exactly.  And we know where Osama is, for the most part, within a few miles?  Not within, no, I don't think so.  Well, think about the mountains of Wajiristan.  This is those tribal areas in Pakistan.  Think of them like the Appalachian Trail between Maine and Georgia.  It's a huge area.  So we don't even have it pinpointed in a certain area of the mountains?  I thought we did by now.  Sometimes we do, and we've thought we've had him a few times, and he slipped through.  And so it comes and goes. 
[02:38:00]  Is he still powerful?  He still matters, in my view.  And he matters.  He's a symbol to the movement, to the international movement.  His face will always be attached to the worst.  Exactly.  Is it better that he's alive or dead?  No, dead, in my view.  Wouldn't that really motivate a lot of people?  They're pretty motivated already.  No, that's obvious.  No, but I think that the fact that he's still alive shows a certain strength and defiance  of the U.S.  I'd like to kill him and get him off to the scene.  I understand that angle, sure.  And for justice as well.  And it's not one of those situations where you're like, well, who knows, if the next guy 
[02:38:30]  that comes in could be worse.  How could he be worse?  Exactly.  Yeah.  So you do want to take him out.  And he's a major symbol.  And I think he needs to be taken out.  Also, those camps still matter.  I like, in the book, I told a story about, you know, remember when the London bombing?  Yeah.  This guy, his guy's name was Mohammad Siddiqui Khan.  He lived in Leeds.  He was a middle-class boy from Leeds who took trips to Pakistan, back and forth.  And in Pakistan, in those Al-Qaeda camps, he learned how to make a bomb, he made a tape, 
[02:39:00]  he was further radicalized, he comes back to Leeds, recruits a few of his buddies who  probably wouldn't have done anything without his leadership, and they go into, they take  four bombs into the subway trains of London and kill 52 people.  So that's where you see still the relevance of the Al-Qaeda's central apparatus in Pakistan,  the training, the radical ideology, the preparing of these guys to come back to the West and  conduct an operation. 
[02:39:30]  That's why we need to really knock them out in Afghanistan and prevent that movement back  and forth.  Speaking of the subway bombings, could that happen?  I mean, obviously it could happen, but what are the odds of it happening in New York City?  Are we safe as far as that type of attack goes?  And second part of the question, what kind of attack do you think will happen next?  Well, they like transportation attacks.  And when I was at NYPD, we instituted this random bag searches here because we recognize  that the subways are a target.  They blew up trains in Spain. 
[02:40:00]  They blew up the subways in London.  They've also, the Chechens have attacked subways in Moscow.  So it's a favorite target.  But when I ride the subway, and I have a five-year-old boy who lives here in New York City, and he rides  the subway.  That's what he likes to do on weekends.  He just loves it.  And I ride it with him.  We have about four to six million riders a day.  There's about 600 stations.  You know, if Al Qaeda pushes me out of the subway, my five-year-old boy, I've given them  a victory they don't deserve.  Could they attack the subway tomorrow? 
[02:40:30]  Possibly.  But will I get on the subway when I leave here?  Absolutely, yes.  What do you think a big threat to, one thing that people have talked about was that there  were, after the Soviet Union collapses, the portable nukes that were missing, these suitcase  nukes, I have two questions.  One, how likely is it?  I mean, obviously, they want one.  But how likely is it they'll get one?  And how big are they?  I mean, I know suitcase, you know, is an expression for it.  How realistically big is it?  That's very highly sensitive information.  They're bigger than a suitcase, though.  But they're small.  They're small enough to move around. 
[02:41:00]  And there's different types and sizes of the smaller nukes.  I think that threat is serious.  You always have to stay focused about loose nuclear weapons or nuclear materials.  But in fact, the fact of the matter is, if Al Qaeda was going to get a loose nuke, they  would have done that about eight years ago.  Now those are tightened up a lot better than they were before.  The Soviet Union broke apart 15 years ago, over 15 years ago.  So since then, a lot of money has been invested in trying to police up all that stuff to try  to make sure those materials are safeguarded. 
[02:41:30]  So I think it's going to be difficult for Al Qaeda to get their hands on something like  they'd love to do it.  And do you think the leadership of Al Qaeda, however tattered they are at this point, do  you think they'd think of any repercussions against themselves by the entire world and making  the United States completely sympathetic if they did do something as extreme as use a  nuclear device?  You would have to think, all right, we like to picture them as these savage animals that 
[02:42:00]  are just out to kill us, but there's got to be someone with a little sense that would  go, this would really make martyrs of America and kind of give them a better view to the world.  Is that wishful thinking?  There is some restraint on Al Qaeda, but I wouldn't trust them with a nuke.  For instance, I'll show you some of the restraint in Iraq.  Remember Zarqawi, he was the Al Qaeda guy in Iraq who got killed about two years ago.  He was a real thug. 
[02:42:30]  He, remember, he was the guy on TV sawing people's heads off, and he was also killing  other Muslim Shias, and he launched an attack into Jordan where he blew up a wedding.  And there was a repulsion, even in Al Qaeda, of these are the worst people.  And so Zarqawi got himself a little bit crosswise with Al Qaeda because he was sawing people's  heads off on film because he blew up a wedding.  And so there are restraints, even on the worst of terrorists. 
[02:43:00]  What was her name?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  What was her name?  Margaret, the woman who was killed, she was a friend to the Iraqi.  She had spent 30 years over there.  Right, right.  And the fact is, they killed her, and they threw water on her when she was crying.  They wouldn't even, even I think Hezbollah even released condolences to them.  I mean, you know, which fucked them too.  But I mean, Margaret Hassan, I think her name was.  And that was something that even they have.  So there is some restraint.  However, I think Al Qaeda is the most dangerous of all terrorist organizations that have the 
[02:43:30]  least restraint.  And I believe if they could get their hands on one of these weapons and mass instructions,  they would use it.  And so we really need to, in my view, the way you defend yourself from that is not by  setting up all these screening things in ports.  I think that's a waste of time and money either.  Because they'll just, if they had it, they'd just, if they had it in a boat, they'd be like  a drug smugger.  They'd just download it to a smaller boat and bring it on shore.  They wouldn't bring it through the cargo screener.  So why build those things?  The way you'd prevent them from getting their hands on these type of materials is by crushing 
[02:44:00]  the cell, crushing the organization so that it doesn't have the capability to build, to  get it.  Once they get it, you're in trouble.  Some sort of defensive mechanisms are not likely to help you.  It's too late.  Yeah.  The organization, it has to be broken down.  The lines of communication, the finances, all of those things.  They were very well put together before 9-11.  I mean, when you look and do some reading on what it took for them to organize that, just 
[02:44:30]  years that they were able to put this together.  They had the money, the cash flow, the communication was there.  They were traveling.  If you could break that down, it makes it very difficult for them to organize.  Absolutely.  The travel is important.  And this is why our airports are always going to have a lot of focus.  And our borders, which that discussion is also important, if you can prevent them from  traveling, from raising money, it hampers them.  It really, it denies their organization the capability to become more sophisticated. 
[02:45:00]  And so even if they do slip through with someone with a 9-millimeter mall or a small bomb on  a bus, this isn't something that's going to take down our country.  And we have to keep that in mind.  Sometimes I talk to people about, imagine if the terrorists wipe out an entire mid-sized  city in the United States and shut down a porch for over a week.  What would that do to the United States?  And so it'd be horrible where a country would go into a tailspin.  I said, no, that already happened. 
[02:45:30]  Katrina wiped out a city and shut down the ports in the Gulf for over a week.  And guess what?  That year, our economy as a nation grew by 4.5%.  We're an incredibly big and resilient place.  So if we don't terrorize ourselves, if they blow up our bus or knock down a building, it  doesn't even register in a country with a $13 trillion annual economy.  It happened.  They depend.  Al Qaeda depends on us self-terrorizing and paralyzing ourselves. 
[02:46:00]  If a bus, a bomb goes off in a bus in New York City, they'll want us to shut down all  buses across the country and search every passenger.  So it paralyzes our country.  We shouldn't do that.  We're giving them a victory they don't deserve.  You brought up a great point there with Katrina.  Because if that was terrorist bombs on the levees that flooded the city like that, we would  have, you're right, tailspin.  Minus 10% GDP.  The market would have just gone down the crap.  Right.  But since it was an act of nature, it did shut down a city completely, ports, and we went 
[02:46:30]  on.  The country prospered that year.  Interesting.  Tragedy for New Orleans, but the country got over it.  Houston.  I want to go back to 9-11.  What do you think of the conspiracy theories?  They're out there and very frustrating.  I did a radio show in San Francisco about a few days ago.  It's a conservative town.  Oh, my gosh.  In the middle of it, the guy says to me, well, NORAD, which is this Air Force command, they 
[02:47:00]  must have known something.  They were doing exercises that day.  He was talking about F-16s.  And I said to him, are you mean that the U.S.  United States Air Force was in conspiracy with Al-Qaeda?  And I basically said, you're nuts.  No.  It's hard.  I understand conspiracy theories.  Even Americans believe, half of Americans believe that the government was involved in  the JFK assassination.  There's so much murky stuff around it.  People use conspiracies to explain the unexplainable.  And when I travel in the Middle East, people say to me, how, the 19 jokers with box cutters? 
[02:47:30]  Come on.  That didn't happen.  You guys, you know, you guys are the most powerful country in the world.  That couldn't have happened.  The CIA did it.  The Jews and the CIA and the Mossad did it.  Israel was involved.  We know.  You know, you guys, wink, wink.  And I'm saying, no, you know, that's not the case.  But they have to see some conspiracy.  The fact is, Al-Qaeda was around, 19 guys got through a system that was asleep, and  everything went right for them that day, and they knocked down two billions. 
[02:48:00]  And not everything, though, because the last plane didn't go.  Right.  Not everything.  75% of their plan worked, but as soon as passengers knew what they were doing, that  last plane went down.  I always say it wasn't guys with box cutters.  It was passengers with hope that actually allowed the terrorists to do what they did.  Because we hadn't, no one had ever done anything like that.  So the passengers, usually, from movies or past history, you sit there, you land on  the tarmac, you wait.  That's a great point.  It just happens.  But it was this hope that everyone had that it's going to be okay, that they didn't attack. 
[02:48:30]  The second the passengers, yeah, in the last plane knew that, no, they're crashing this,  they got up and started moving.  And it was pilots trained to negotiate and come out of the cockpit.  They were told.  You know, that's what they were supposed to do.  I have two questions, because one's a very easy answer, I'm sure, for you.  I don't know the answer.  The first question is, who's our most valuable ally so far?  I mean, I'm going to guess Bushara, but I could be wrong.  And the response the U.S. had when it was first going to Afghanistan, and now, is this 
[02:49:00]  what Al-Qaeda anticipated?  They knew there'd be a response.  Have we underestimated, like, have they underestimated us or overestimated us or what on a response?  Let me answer the first question first.  They did anticipate us coming to Afghanistan, but they thought Afghanistan would look like  Iraq, that they would mire us in a quagmire for a decade-long war.  They didn't realize they were going to get the crap beat out of them in Afghanistan as  quickly as they did.  Now, they did escape, unfortunately.  I wish we'd gotten bin Laden when he'd gone out the back door through Torbora into Pakistan. 
[02:49:30]  But they thought they were going to really bog us down in Afghanistan.  Now, it kind of looks like it's coming back a little bit.  But they didn't expect to be defeated so quickly in that.  So, they underestimated, but they're kind of regrouping anyhow.  Our most important allies are probably the two most important countries in terrorism are  Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.  And they're both allies, but they're troubled allies. 
[02:50:00]  Pakistan has problems in the border areas there.  Now, they're talking to the Taliban, and Musharraf and the Pakistanis are key allies.  We've got to keep them together.  Saudi Arabia is also a key ally.  They've been fighting al-Qaeda for three or four years.  But at the same time, some of the funding comes out of there.  Some of the ideological fervor comes out of there.  So, these are two key countries that we can't turn our back on.  We don't always like what they do.  They're not always perfect allies, but they're the most important ones because they're in the 
[02:50:30]  middle of it.  But don't their people hate us?  It's like if Musharraf goes, or I think it's the House of Saudi, if they fall, won't the  radicals like in Iran just move right in, like after the Shah left or was thrown out  by the Ayatollah?  Yeah, there's some fear of that, both in Pakistan and Saudi, that these may not be the best people,  but if they go, we will have worse.  But actually, in Pakistan in particular, Saudi Arabia is a little bit different.  But in Pakistan, Pakistanis may not love our government all the time, but they love the 
[02:51:00]  United States.  If they had an opportunity to move their family over, they'd be on the next plane.  So, at least the mainstream Pakistanis.  So, this is a country that we can work with, and we have to work with.  They have sections of their country that are still very tribal, very isolated, and that's  where Ben Laden is running around in there.  And the Pakistanis have always had trouble working in those parts of the country.  When Pakistan was created, that part of the world, they didn't even want to be part of  Pakistan.  They didn't want to be part of India.  They wanted to be left alone, and they sort of cut this deal with their autonomous region. 
[02:51:30]  And that's really the wild, wild west out there.  And we're just going to have to slog it out there.  That problem is not going to go away.  And we're just going to have to work with the Pakistanis, and they're not the best of  allies all the time, not the best of friends.  They're not, you know, this is in the U.K., where we're really in lockstep.  And same thing with the Saudis.  We're just going to have to work with them.  And you said the mountains.  I didn't know this.  Because we're thinking, all right, let's get them.  From Maine to where?  You said that's Georgia?  It's like the Appalachian Corral, yeah. 
[02:52:00]  That is...  You're talking about thousands of miles.  You can't just bomb the entire mountain range, you know.  That's what you think.  Just bomb the fucking place.  Yeah, yeah.  That's huge.  Imagine the redcoats trying to find Daniel Boone in those mountains.  They're not going to find them.  Hey, you're going to make a monkey out of them.  So it's the same thing in those mountains up there.  You are not going to trudge soldiers in their redcoats through the mountains of Afghanistan  and find bin Laden.  You've got to use intelligence.  You've got to be smart about it.  You've got to penetrate his organization.  But I always use the point, remember after 9-11, this young kid, Johnny Walker Lynn got 
[02:52:30]  arrested and brought back to the U.S. and tried.  Here's a kid, a 19-year-old kid from Virginia, who joins al-Qaeda, and he gets to meet bin Laden  twice before 9-11.  And someone asked me once, I was giving a speech, they said to me, hey, if Johnny Walker  Lynn was able to join al-Qaeda and meet with bin Laden, why couldn't the CIA do it?  And I said, that's a damn good question.  And keep asking that question, because they should have been able to.  That's amazing.  So they're not, this is not an organization that's geniuses.  You know, they've made a lot of mistakes. 
[02:53:00]  Who do you think was responsible for the decimation of our intelligence in this country?  Because obviously during the Cold War, we were at the top of our game.  And then, was it just a changing world environment?  Yes, yes.  But how did we lose so much of our strength as far as intelligence goes?  What happened was they made mistakes, the CIA and the FBI.  They were spying on college kids that were protesting the Vietnam War.  They were spying on Martin Luther King.  And so there were some investigations. 
[02:53:30]  You remember, late 1970s, Senator Church started the Church Committee.  And they did investigations on abuses of the CIA and FBI that were using domestic intelligence.  And then every once in a while, there was this scandal of some assassination attempt that went bad overseas or something, or a coup or whatever.  And what happened was these agencies, the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, all these super secret agencies, they got pummeled politically and bureaucratically. 
[02:54:00]  And what happened over time, they basically, they became toothless giants that just had no edge, no creativity.  There's boring bureaucracies that go to meetings and then just don't get it.  And after 9-11, they got shook up and they got edge again and people got fired up.  And that's what beat Al-Qaeda was just focus on creativity and edge, not billions of dollars.  We had the assets there.  Just turn them on.  It amazed me that they had to actually advertise, like, hey, is there anyone that speaks Farsi? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Like, before 9-11.  It's still a problem, actually.  Here's the problem with the language speakers that we've solved at NYPD.  We still, at the CIA and FBI, they have problems hiring a language speaker because if a guy speaks fluent Farsi, well, it probably means his parents are Iranian.  So he can't get a security clearance.  Well, come on, guys.  At NYPD, we had all these cops that speak all the languages of New York City.  That's what's great about New York City.  We have 50% of the city is foreign-born. 
[02:55:00]  So we have all these great language speakers and we utilize them.  But, of course, we didn't bring them into the top secret operations we're running.  You leave them on the edge of that, but you use their capability to help you understand the communities you're looking at.  And I think we did that very well at NYPD.  And, again, we didn't have to spend tens of billions of dollars to do it.  You do it with the resources you have at hand and you make decisions.  Is there something called the Hercules team?  Yes.  Hercules is an NYPD program that sends out uniformed armed guys in uniform. 
[02:55:30]  It's sort of a show of force.  That's called Hercules teams.  It's a policing technique.  Is it more just to show force and intimidation?  That's right.  To kind of show the terrorists that we're still out here.  And also they use it to...  Those are the guys that just look like video game characters?  They're pretty good guys, yeah.  From head to toe.  Big bulky guys warmed up with long barrel weapons.  Sure.  And it's really sent a signal to any would-be terrorists that we're out here.  And they're specially trained? 
[02:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  They're very good.  Very good.  And they also are talking to the people.  If you see something, say something, give us a call.  They're talking to the security guys at the main buildings.  We're here.  It does make you feel safer when you see them here and there.  It's an important subway or something.  It's a safe thing, but it also, it kind of makes you go, wow, we've kind of come a long way.  Yeah.  And by the way, by itself, that's not going to protect us.  Whenever I tell people about, when I talk about Hercules, I say, you've got a Hercules unit there that you see.  What's really protecting the city is what you don't see. 
[02:56:30]  Don't see.  And that's what's really getting it done.  Hercules is a nice augmentation to that.  But what really protects is you don't see.  Mike, what don't we see?  I can't get into that.  I know you can't, but is it impressive?  Would we be like, wow?  Yeah, it really is.  Really good.  I would love to know.  A lot of the technology that's out there now is really amazing.  Surveillance technology that's being utilized.  Big brother, man.  Yeah.  Oh, and I hear that.  It just disgusts me, too.  It is.  No, I like the surveillance equipment that's around. 
[02:57:00]  I like the fact that you walk around the city, 90% of the time you're on camera.  Exactly.  Probably more than that.  And I think as far as crime goes, it's helped out a lot.  It's solved a lot.  It might have been a deterrent also.  And as far as terrorism goes, boy, we sure got a good look at the people in London.  And that rolled up the cells.  And same thing in Madrid.  They got video of them.  Do you guys use Google Earth?  I use it.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Some of the bad guys, unfortunately. 
[02:57:30]  This book is called Crush the Cell.  I mean, it's obviously you really know what you're doing.  And his name is Michael Sheehan, S-H-E-E-H-A-N.  And Mike Hall, one of our guys, he's a cop here in New York.  And he said that you are just the guy who knows more about this than anybody.  So I'm looking at your resume.  I'm like, all right, well, what?  It's very impressive.  I mean, a real resume.  It's like...  Doesn't it make you feel crappy about what you've done in your life?  You mean it's not a list of radio stations you work at?  It's like a New York City Deputy Commissioner of a Counterterrorism. 
[02:58:00]  I mean, these are real posts.  And the one...  They just sneak it at the end.  It's really interesting.  And Commander of a Counterterrorism Hostage Rescue Unit in the U.S. Army Special Forces.  Wow.  Which, now, are you the guys that they would call...  Like, if Cesar Cowher had somebody and they knew where it was,  would you have to try to negotiate with these people?  Is that what you did?  Well, first of all, I was not in Delta Force.  Delta Force is like the major leagues for counterterrorism.  And I was in the minor leagues.  I was in Panama. 
[02:58:30]  And we were sort of the backup to Delta.  But it was a hostage rescue unit created during the Iran-Contra crisis.  And remember when Delta went into the desert and had those problems with their helicopters  and the whole thing turned south?  That was in 1980.  At that time, I was in Panama training to do hostage rescue operations in Colombia  and other parts of the world.  And we did some interesting things during that period.  So I would say, to use a sports analogy, I was a minor league ballplayer in the counterterrorism  business as a shooter.  But we were pretty proud of ourselves. 
[02:59:00]  We knew how to kick in the doors, pick out the targets, and take them out.  And you did something for the United Nations, too.  It said you were Assistant Secretary General of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  at the UN.  It seems like a lot of these operations at the UN, they send them in the blue helmets,  and they're just observers.  And they really don't give them any ability to do anything.  Is that because the UN is poorly run?  Well, the UN has a mixed record.  Sometimes when they're successful, you don't hear about it.  I remember when I was in eastern Congo once, and we showed up with a platoon of Moroccans, 
[02:59:30]  and they weren't the greatest soldiers on the planet.  But when they showed up to this town, I think it was called Bunya, one of these towns in eastern  Congo, about 50,000 people over the next week came out of the bush that were eating bark  and worms out there, and they're starving to death.  And just the fact that a platoon was there, they had the confidence to come in, and then the  relief agency started to feed them.  And that's a story you don't hear about.  You do hear about when they get humiliated by some thugs that take away their weapons  and make jerks of them. 
[03:00:00]  And so they have a spotty record.  And if, you know, for every five things they do well, they get humiliated and look like  asses, and that's unfortunate.  But they are what they are.  The UN is the countries of the world, as good and as bad as they are.  And sometimes we do well, and sometimes not so well.  I'm with Jimmy.  You've got a very impressive resume, but I want to see how good you really are.  My pal Anthony was going 95 in a 55.  Yeah.  Could you get me out of a ticket? 
[03:00:30]  We'll sell you a few books, but he's in a tough spot right now.  40 miles over the speed limit.  Let's see how good you really are.  Yeah, that was a bad one.  Well, we can work on that one.  As long as you aren't BWI.  No.  No.  Is anything going to be done?  That was a good boy.  Actually, Mike Cole sent a little thing.  He said, go easy on him.  He's a friend.  Oh, yeah.  We know that.  Well, me and Cole are Met fans together, and we suffer through the ups and downs of that. 
[03:01:00]  He's a great cop.  He's one of those cops that you just love.  You know, these are tough guys that are smart.  They're respectful.  They're not going to booze people.  Mike Cole?  I'm kidding, of course.  I love Mike.  They're going to put handcuffs on the bad guys, and they're going to protect the good guys  in the city.  The TMZ kid?  That's what they do.  Mike has thick...  This is the problem with Mike.  Mike probably punches really hard, because Mike has fat hands, and Mike probably really  packs quite a wallop, because he doesn't look that intimidating, but he's just a squat  little powerful bastard. 
[03:01:30]  Mike's like a...  Mike also is terrible with me.  He comes in one day, and he shows me a nice new HK, a .40 cal.  He's a gun buff.  And, yeah, I know.  So he goes, look, look at this.  Look at this one.  The next day, I'm down at the gun store buying one, because I needed that one after he showed  me that.  Just don't take it on an airplane.  No, like, yeah.  Oh, Dennis Freeman.  Dennis Freeman.  Loaded on an airplane.  Hey, I made a mistake.  Yeah, that's going to be a problem for him.  Not a good idea.  And he's gotten me insane about 5'11". 
[03:02:00]  I wear 5'11 stuff all the time now.  Everyone laughs at me.  I love their pants.  Their shirts are great.  Well, we've got to go out to a range sometime.  I absolutely want to do that.  Can you imagine shooting with this guy?  Well, yeah, it would be a lot of fun to be humiliated.  He got a speeding ticket on 5'11", by the way.  I'm like, look, the sign was on your head the whole time.  You were wearing the hat.  That was the other day.  I don't like the fact that Anthony is trying to bond with Mike.  I'm trying to bond with men together with guns and tactical clothing.  You're running around in the yard like the kid the beginning of Born on the Fourth of July with a stick. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Ah, you smart ass.  So, Mike, how safe are we in New York City right now?  At the end of my book, I say, if I feel we're unsafe in New York City, I'm packing up and leaving.  I'm not going to make a martyr of my family.  I have a wife and a 5-year-old boy here.  We're safe in this city.  And they're out there.  I'm going to get your email address.  Let me know when that changes, because I live in New York.  I'll go to Montana and get a shack out there.  The second he leaves, I'm out of here. 
[03:03:00]  We're going to become email pals.  Yeah, we're safe.  I don't think you answered the question.  The next terrorist attack, in your humble opinion, is it going to be a subway?  Is it going to be one of these suicide bombers?  A bus?  What are you thinking?  If I had to bet, it would be a subway or a building.  Another building?  Yeah, a car bomb.  But we've got the guys.  We have to show ID going in and out of these buildings.  They just blow it up at the curb line.  It's so funny, because terrorists use their real names.  Like, Mohammed Atta used his real name.  They all use their names.  It doesn't help to have someone's show ID, unless you do some kind of a retina scan and 
[03:03:30]  have that in it.  It's amazing.  Civil liberties, we certainly need them.  But I don't see us losing civil liberties by cameras being up in New York.  I think the civil libertarians take anything the government wants to do, and they make it  look like they're walking into your house and making sure you're having sex properly.  It's ridiculous where they go with you.  Having a national ID card would go a long way for the operations that I've been involved  with, just so you know who's who and who isn't.  And for some reason, both the right and the left wing are scared of a national ID card. 
[03:04:00]  And I say, you already have one.  It's called your driver's license, your credit card.  Yet somehow, if we talk about a national ID card, people think it's Big Brother taking  over our lives, which is just nonsense.  Has either way, the far left or the far right, I know you said you were in the middle, has  either one of them really hindered what is trying to be done that's effective?  Yeah, I think so.  I think the far left gets too squeamish about civil liberties and is pushing back on the 
[03:04:30]  wiretapping and the investigations, and I worry about that.  The far right sometimes gets us off into tangents and wastes a lot of money and gets us off  track.  And so I think both of them can harm the effort.  It's really not that hard.  You just have to stick with what it's really about, which is these intelligence operations.  I always tell people, think about it penetrating the mafia.  If you just arrest the guy who's stealing the stereo off the back of a truck, you try to 
[03:05:00]  do that all the time.  You're not going to get the organization.  You've got to penetrate it up.  If you just arrest the pot seller in Harlem, you're not going to break down a drug trafficking  organization.  You've got to get up into it.  And that's what it's all about.  And that requires those types of intelligence operations.  And the left is worried about civil liberties.  The right, they want to go off and spend billions and send thousands of troops into wars.  I think neither of those are really productive.  Isn't it odd how they leave the word Islam out of... 
[03:05:30]  It's almost like...  It's amazing how frightened people are of acknowledging that this is a problem with radical Islam when  they say this is why they're doing it.  They associate themselves with Islam.  And you never, ever hear that from the government because they don't want it to be misconceived as a war on Islam.  I understand that, too.  A lot of our friends overseas, our Islamic friends, are saying these people call themselves Muslims,  but they're not.  They're killers and they're cowards and they're hijacking our religion.  So they ask us, don't call these guys Islamists, even though they say they are, because they 
[03:06:00]  don't have anything to do with our faith.  They're killers that have hijacked it for their own purposes.  But isn't there a silent agreement?  Right.  If not with the method, but the end justifies the mean.  Isn't there some kind of a silent agreement?  And I'm not saying all Muslims.  People say I'm anti-Muslim.  I'm really not.  But I'm just saying, like, you don't see these countries, unless it's a military dictator,  like Musharov, crushing.  No, that's right.  That's right.  And here's why.  Here's why.  In many of these countries, they're struggling. 
[03:06:30]  They don't have good systems of governments.  They don't have good economies of the poorer ones.  And so there's resentment among the population.  And they resent not only their own leaders, which are corrupt and ineffective, but they always  resent, well, who's the most powerful guys on the block?  It's the Americans.  Well, they must be responsible for my misery, for my social misery, for my psychic misery,  and for my economic misery.  And so they blame us.  And so if we get kicked in the shins by some guy holding a Muslim banner, there's some slight 
[03:07:00]  satisfaction in it.  So even on 9-11, although most people in the Islamic world were horrified by that, there  were some, and you saw some cheering in the streets and others saying, well, you know,  the big guy got a kick in the knee.  And you know what?  We're bigger than that.  We can get over that.  And we don't have to resent people that resent us.  Because we're so big and so strong.  And that is going to be the way it's going to be for our country for the decades ahead,  that people always have a little resentment toward us.  I got to go back, because you just casually said that.  But most people in Islamic countries were horrified by what happened on 9-11. 
[03:07:30]  Because I think the average American would be surprised by that.  No, horrified.  That comment.  No.  Because what you see on TV is, that's all they show is the people in the street, like,  woo, burning flags.  But you never hear of the outrage.  It would be nice to hear a little condemnation of terrorist acts from Muslims.  There's always an asterisk.  Well, the U.S. foreign policy.  There's always that you're asking for an asterisk.  Why not just, hey, you know, we're completely outraged and disgusted by what people are doing 
[03:08:00]  in the name of our religion.  You never really hear of that.  They need more of it and reason why they're more of it.  Because, actually, and I tell my Muslim friends this, you're more threatened by these guys  than us.  Right.  Al-Qaeda is not going to take down the U.S.  But some of these countries could be threatened by this movement, by these organizations.  They could topple their governments and be in charge.  So I said, you really need to stand up and put these guys down.  Because you're much more threatened than us.  They may kill a few Americans, but we're going to be still a great and powerful country. 
[03:08:30]  You guys better get through the program.  Have a rougher time at the soccer field than you did before they took over.  Oh, yeah.  Do you think that...  Horrible people.  Jesus.  That was Taliban.  Right.  God.  Not how many soccer games going on over there.  No.  They would just take people there and saw their heads off.  It was like, all right, here we go.  Half time.  Blood-soaked midfield.  Yeah.  The Soviet Union, do you think that the world attitude towards the U.S., because we were  always seen as a counterbalance to the Russians, the good guys, and they were the bad guys. 
[03:09:00]  And it just seems like shitty Europe has gotten some real bad attitudes about the U.S.  ever since the threat of the Russians kicking in their front doors has gone away.  And now that they have that little man thing where they have this resentment against us,  and it's kind of aggravating.  It is.  I mean, the Europeans really irritate me often.  And what they do is they kind of triangulate themselves and sort of put themselves in a  bitter position.  Okay, they say to the rest of the world, yeah, those crazy Americans are going to...  They'll do the dirty work in the world, and we'll kind of be friends with everybody. 
[03:09:30]  And they play off the U.S. against everybody else and put themselves in a better position.  It is very irritating.  They do that with the Iranians.  They know the American power is going to be the check on Iranian nonsense, whether it's  nuclear or terrorism or whatever, and they kind of play footsie with them.  And we are the ones that have the sanctions against them, all the pressure, and the Europeans...  We'll do business with them.  Exactly.  And because they know at the end of the day we're going to step up.  And so we wind up, in my view, doing a lot more of the protection work in the world, 
[03:10:00]  and sometimes we can be saps for that.  It doesn't take Europe long, after a crisis or war or something, to just turn around and  go, oh, forget what you did.  Just weasels.  For years we kept Russia from just running over them.  They laid down for whoever knocked on the door.  They opened the door and laid down for them.  No, and they see themselves as more savvy and sophisticated than the dumb Americans that  are kind of stumbling around, and it's really irritating.  Is Iran afraid of us?  I mean, I kind of think that we don't negotiate with certain people or talk to certain people. 
[03:10:30]  Sometimes I think you kind of have to, even if they're pricks.  But is he really worried?  Because he talks a big game about wiping Israel off the map, and is he as crazy?  No, they're not.  The Iranians are not crazy.  This regime has been around since 79.  Remember when they kicked out the Shah and the Ayatollahs came in?  So it's been going on 30 years, and they're very sane, and they know how to whip up their  constituency with anti-Israeli rhetoric, with anti-American rhetoric. 
[03:11:00]  It just kind of strengthens their own base at home.  So a lot of that rhetoric is for the home base, and they know where they can push and where  they can't.  And so they're very sane.  And I think in dealing with Iran or Hezbollah, that set of problems don't allow their rhetoric  to push ourselves into self-defeating positions.  Was it like what Kim Jong-il was kind of mentioning, attacking California?  It's just kind of shit-talking, pretty much.  Yeah, it's pretty silly.  I actually went and visited him when I was in the State Department. 
[03:11:30]  I was ambassador for counterterrorism in the State Department.  I went over and visited that nut job.  How short is he?  Is he a little fella?  He was about 4'11", with the 5-inch heels.  He stinks.  I'm kidding.  And he had really bad hair and a really bad outfit, and this kind of...  He was a skinny, fat guy, if you know what I mean.  His arms were like noodles, yet he had this kind of bulging belly.  It was really disgusting.  Please tell me you pointed that out to him.  Nice outfit.  It worked. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, God.  Mike, what do you do now when you're not writing...  Well, this is your first book, Crush the Cell.  Right now I'm doing a little consulting.  I have a consultancy group here.  I've got a couple of clients in New York City trying to keep the city safe without making  it into an armed camp.  And I'm doing a little work overseas as well and trying to make a living.  Do you miss getting your hands dirty, though?  Oh, yeah.  No, I've spent...  Now that you've got a 5-year-old boy, I'm thinking the wife might be like,  eh, Mike, you know.  Well, I've got to save for college.  You can't be running around in the jungles anymore.  No, exactly.  I miss it. 
[03:12:30]  My best years when I was in the Special Forces, when I was in Panama, that was when I was 25 years old.  So, you know, it's great.  Full of piss and vinegar all ready to go out on that next mission.  Now I'm kind of, you know, sitting around and writing a book.  It's not the same as kicking in doors and climbing uphill.  I was on a climbing team, and we got to climb up through elevator shafts, and I just had a great time every day.  You never get that.  I'm a scrawny guy.  Well, you look like an administrator.  He's a nice-looking gentleman with a suit jacket, a very distinguished-looking fellow. 
[03:13:00]  Rip your throat out right now.  I know.  It's kind of frightening.  He probably likes to bite faces when he's killed.  Actually, my team sergeant, when I was in Panama, his name was Dirty Joe Walker.  I can't get into why.  He was nicknamed Dirty Joe.  We can imagine that.  What is his humor?  Dirty Joe always said, if you have to use your hands to kill somebody, you've really made a mistake.  He believed in the .45 caliber pistol method.  Right.  He said, yeah.  That's so true.  Never get yourself in a kung fu.  You fucked up somewhere.  Exactly.  The beauty of Mike, we play video games. 
[03:13:30]  He lives video games.  Or used to, anyway.  Wow.  Joe said, never get in a kung fu fight.  The guy should be dead before he gets close to you.  That is funny, though, that you're quoting Dirty Joe, who's like, look, if you can't shoot him,  something has happened that shouldn't have happened.  Exactly.  You're right.  Love Dirty Joe.  Dirty Joe rules.  I imagine no one breaks into your home, huh?  Well, we're at the safe city.  He's probably hoping, though.  Yeah.  For old time's sake, he wants to do some just damage.  I need Mike Cole around.  They always goof on me about my fear of home invasions out on Long Island. 
[03:14:00]  Tell him how you walk around.  He's a man's man.  Tell him how you walk around the house.  First, I'm going to preface it by telling a little bit about, you know,  I'm from Long Island.  It's the home invasion capital of the world, I think.  I understand the reality of the situation, but I do present a good target, I think.  I have a regular schedule, which I would like to break up a little,  but because of my job, it's hard to do that.  So there's certain rituals that I do that kind of mark me a little bit. 
[03:14:30]  I like to carry a weapon on me when I'm home.  See, he's laughing at you.  He saw the laugh.  I like, and people are like, no, I'm not sitting there with a Wild West low-slung six-shooter on my hip,  but I like having something on me so that if a problem presents itself and I am being invaded,  my home is being broken into.  Don't look at me. 
[03:15:00]  I'm not helping you out.  I won't have to be the guy going, I wish I could get to my drawer,  or I wish I could get to the safe, or I wish I could get to this.  I am ready.  I'm prepared.  And he has an alarm system, by the way.  You could probably put it in your drawer.  Damn it!  And a cop pretty much lives with him at this point.  He doesn't live with me.  He's helping me out with the...  He carries a gun in his house.  He thinks it's comfortable.  He tells himself, this is actually comfortable.  It's a little Walther PPKS.  I knew a guy in the Congo, in the UN, who was a victim of a home invasion. 
[03:15:30]  And they came in with AKs, and they spent three hours emptying out of his house.  And they even took all the clothes out of his closet,  and then they said to him, take the clothes off that he was wearing,  and they took them and left them standing there naked,  and they got the truck loaded up and left, and they just drove away.  And there he was, naked with his...  Nothing!  His house was empty.  It took him completely empty.  No clothes, he's naked.  Oh, that won't be me.  You'll have your 9mm.  I'll have my .380 or my 9 or something. 
[03:16:00]  They'll tell you to be quiet.  You're going to reach for the gun on your underpants,  and I'll just machine gun you, lunatic.  Not the Congo, so...  Philly Tyrant from Philly, backing up a little bit.  He writes, do you miss getting your hands dirty?  Translation, do you miss the feel of your...  Enemy's blood squishing between your toes?  Hello!  Oh, God.  So you were involved in the...  I know, I feel like a little kid just asking questions.  This is so cool.  It said you were involved...  Something with the White House, too.  This is like a paragraph-long resume with a lot of big words in it.  What did you do? 
[03:16:30]  Ambassador-at-Large for counterterrorism at the State Department,  and there was something in the White House.  When I was a major in the Army, I wound up...  I was in the Defense Intelligence Agency, and it was really boring.  I was sitting there, and again, one of those bureaucrats writing memos to each other  and going to meetings, and it was really boring.  So I got involved in the counter-narcotics intelligence,  and from there, I wound up at the White House as a major  on the NSC staff, National Security Council staff.  And that was sort of my big break.  From there, I kind of went up into the State Department,  and my career went from the jungles and the mountains 
[03:17:00]  into the corridors of Washington.  And that was fun, but I was sure happy to get back to New York City  and kind of get back on the street a little bit.  Do you have, because police officers have cards and stuff  that they give out, like a PVA card.  I imagine his is pretty good for getting out of a ticket.  Not that you'd want to hand them out at the end,  but if you happen to, it would be wonderful.  It won't help.  It helps out those cards sometimes.  Yeah, yeah.  As long as you're not D-We, then you're in trouble.  But if you're just doing a 95 and a 55. 
[03:17:30]  That's probably the worst thing you could do is D-We  and hand over a PVA card.  It's like, what cop gave this drunk this card?  Well, you're the real deal.  I mean, you really know what you're talking about.  Mike Cole raved about it.  It crushed the cell.  Because I was perusing it.  It's not some boring, like just long,  there's like a whole bunch of little paragraph headings  and stuff like that.  You could just open any page,  and it looks like something interesting to read,  which is really great.  I mean, there's a bunch of different little subheadings, 
[03:18:00]  which I love.  Not that I, like when I look at a book,  this is how shallow I am.  I'm always like, can I enjoy it on the toilet?  That's where I do a tremendous amount of my reading.  And it's like, this is something,  you don't have to start from beginning to end.  You can, but you can just open it  and read little paragraphs.  Very interesting, man.  Absolutely.  Working on another?  I might.  The second one, it might be on counterinsurgencies.  I used to do that when I was in the Special Forces.  And again, I think common sense approach  to how to win insurgencies,  like in Iraq or Afghanistan.  That seems like a real tough nut to crack. 
[03:18:30]  It's a tough one.  So that one's kind of stumbling around with it now.  It's hard to write.  I don't doubt it.  But is Al-Zawahari the real brains behind the operation?  Because I always thought Bin Laden was more of a rich,  I mean, he's a fighter,  but he seems like the real radical, the Egyptian.  He seems like the real...  They compliment each other.  Bin Laden has a certain charisma about him.  He's a rich guy,  and he has a certain calmness,  and you don't underestimate him, though.  And he also built the organization.  But Zawahari, the number two, 
[03:19:00]  he brought in,  he came from an Egyptian terrorist organization.  He's like Martin and Lewis, I think.  He brought in the real Egyptian fighters  to help give Al-Qaeda some real substance.  So Bin Laden is sort of the ideological leader,  and Zawahari, also ideological,  but also brought Egyptian experienced terrorists  into the organization.  He just explained the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, yeah.  How about that?  We pretty much did.  Who's who?  The way they get the tapes, 
[03:19:30]  they get these tapes to the reporters, too.  I forget how they did that.  One gets dropped off.  It's like done by Courier.  Dead drops, yeah.  They just do a dead drop.  It's picked up,  and they use cutouts,  so they can't...  It's an interesting thing, though,  that it did get from point A to point B,  so there's got to be a way to backtrack that.  What do you mean cut?  At some point,  they've done some of that.  What's a cutout?  What's a cutout?  A cutout is where you drop information  to a third party  who doesn't know the other two,  so if he gets captured,  he only knows half of it, 
[03:20:00]  so you can't unravel the whole line.  So a cutout is...  So there's a chain of connections  in an organization.  Cutouts break that chain  because they don't know the both sides.  Oh, so they'll drop it somewhere  and then tell them after where it is.  Right, and so they don't know where it came from.  And probably doesn't know what it is.  Right, exactly.  So if they get caught,  I don't know.  I just got the phone call to pick it up here,  so you're not going to get unraveled.  Wow.  How can they not do backtracking on web stuff?  I mean, I understand these guys 
[03:20:30]  probably use proxy servers,  but how could they not get them  when they're uploading all this information?  We've had some successes in that area,  but again, it's a very sensitive...  Thanks, Nate.  I ask a lot of...  No, but I like me  because I ask all the sensitive...  We don't want to give away good stuff.  What's that?  It's not like Bin Laden's shown up on PalTalk.  They actually...  Hey, there it is.  There he is!  Terrorists do use telephones,  chat, email chat.  They're in chat rooms.  They're on the internet.  And they know that we're... 
[03:21:00]  The intelligence agencies  are in there looking at them.  They know that.  And that's not a secret I'm giving away.  We use that.  The problem for them is  it's really hard to operate  in a global organization  like Al-Qaeda tries to be  with no communications.  So...  They're tempted.  They always think  they've got a way to beat us.  And...  They've got to break the code.  Yeah, we learned that  from The Wire, right, Jimmy?  Yes.  They've got to break the code.  But I bet you all  Bin Laden has the most simple...  It's probably OBL  and Hotmail.  Yeah.  It was some stupid email address. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, maybe give that one a whirl.  Yeah, sure.  It's in there.  Fantastic, man.  And his password is 911.  You know, it's really hard to break.  Well, they knew...  The funny thing is about that,  the interesting thing about them  doing it on 911,  it was...  Because I heard that the operation  was called Porsche 911  because they knew the date  they were going to do it on,  which is pretty ballsy  considering the amount of things  that could have gone wrong  with weather,  with...  Like, to say,  this is when it's going through.  Well, that's why.  The luck factor was in there, too.  They got...  Everything came together for them  except that last plane. 
[03:22:00]  Were there any that didn't  get off the ground  that maybe, obviously,  we don't know about  because there was all these rumors  that there was another one  that didn't get off?  I don't think so.  I think they got it all.  It was pretty much...  So there were no, like,  box cutters found in planes  after...  That was all just crap after.  That's right.  I think after it was done,  so much...  Like, everything I've read,  they pretty much know exactly  who, where,  the money trail,  the...  They've got it.  Everything, you know?  Unfortunately,  it's all hindsight.  Big point of the conspiracy theorists,  too, and again,  they're nonsense,  but they found...  The weird things that happen 
[03:22:30]  sometimes in these cases  look like conspiracy,  but, I mean,  finding Muhammad Atta's  passport on the ground,  you know,  it's a weird thing.  Although,  if they were going to frame him,  they probably would have made it  a little bit less weird  than his passport  pulling out of the train center.  And one of the great conspiracies  is that the CIA  or somebody put explosives  in the towers.  I know.  That cracks me up that one.  And they show the footage  of this stuff coming out.  Of course,  that's just the pressure  pushing stuff out of it.  And that's proof  that the CIA  blew up the tower. 
[03:23:00]  When people bring that up,  I always bring up the fact  that I've seen a lot of shows  on Discovery  on building demolition.  Right.  Seen what it takes  to prepare a building  to be demolished.  You can't have office workers  in there  going in every day  and prepare a building  with explosives.  And people don't even know.  They use come-alongs  and springs  and things  to bring it in on itself.  That's way too involved.  That theory  you just explained,  Jesse Ventura  was on our show  and he's starting  to believe that stuff.  Jesse Ventura 
[03:23:30]  is a nut.  Jesse is an ass.  He's an ass.  We had an amazing time  with him.  It got a little ugly  to be honest with you.  You know what it was?  He's saying like,  you know,  okay, I'm a Navy SEAL.  I don't know any better.  And then he's talking  about how he was down  on Ground Zero.  And I wish I had remembered  at the time,  hey dummy,  it took you six years  to come up with this theory.  Like if you were at Ground Zero,  why didn't you notice  as you were waltzing  through the wreckage?  Stupid.  You read a website.  I talk a lot of shit  when he's not here,  by the way.  No, no, no.  I got to stick up for Jimmy.  He talks shit  right in front of Jesse. 
[03:24:00]  No, but I didn't catch that point.  You didn't let him  freaking go on anything.  No, but I would have  killed him at that point.  He seems to have  gone off the deep end.  I remember when he was governor,  he was pretty interesting,  but now he seems to have  kind of,  yeah, he's kind of  taken off.  Yeah.  That happens when you get,  you know.  Well, let's thank our guests  and let Michael Sheehan go.  The book is called  Crush the Cell.  Let me read this part too.  How to Defeat Terrorism  Without Terrorizing Ourselves.  That's kind of important  right there, right?  Yeah.  And it looks like  a really, really  interesting read.  And just flipping through it,  it's obviously the guy 
[03:24:30]  terrorism.  And this is one  I'm actually going to read.  We get a lot of books  we say we're going to read.  But I like the fact  it's not the typical,  this sounds,  because first of all,  you're very soft-spoken  and quiet,  which means that he really  has horrible things  in his head.  Because he's too,  he's too much of a diplomat.  Like, well,  my Muslim friends,  like, you know  that he understands  everything about the tree.  Because I'm such a reactionary idiot.  Get him!  You know,  I don't know  what I'm talking about.  So this is one  I'm really going to read.  I wouldn't want him  to be my father.  Why?  I don't know.  You think you'd figure out  everything you're trying  to do wrong?  Yeah, probably. 
[03:25:00]  That's why, right?  I'm going to fool him.  Yeah, exactly.  Stuck around in a bush  for eight years.  I thought chewing gum  prevented my dad  from knowing  that I was drinking at 15.  Can you imagine  what this guy  comes up with?  Michael Sheen,  are you doing any signings  or you don't have  any scheduled at this point?  I do.  On Wednesday,  I'm doing a speech  at the Manhattan Institute  and I'll probably  do some signings  and maybe I'll probably  do a Barnes & Noble  or something  one of these days.  Well, let us know  because we'll plug it  because this book  looks really, really good.  Oh, I appreciate it.  Thanks so much  for coming in.  Thanks for your time.  I enjoyed it. 
[03:25:30]  It was a pleasure.  Michael Sheen, everyone.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, we're going  to take a quick break  and we'll continue.  Stay there.  There will always be  retarded idiots  to entertain us  with their stupidity.  Mindless,  O.D.  crotch-grabbing  Anthony.  Mindless,  O.D.  crotch-grabbing  Anthony.  People grabbing their crotches  and saying,  suck it.  The O.D.  Anthony Show.  Suck it.  Love the show.  Mindless,  mindless,  mindless,  mindless.  O.D.  Anthony and Anthony.  And we're back. 
[03:26:00]  Just going to throw it.  Well, Anthony,  if that doesn't get you  out of your speeding ticket,  I don't know what else  to do for you,  my friend.  Oh, you think he'll  help me out?  Got one of the top guys  on the show.  That speeding ticket  should go away now.  That 95 and a 55  is just go away.  Have it go away.  That should be done  at this point.  He was a great guest, man.  Absolutely.  Really interesting guy.  Anthony got an email  from Keith,  the cop there.  What was that about?  Keith says,  Boy,  I felt good about 
[03:26:30]  doing your laundry  until Commissioner Sheehan  came in.  What am I doing  with my career?  There's a guy  writing books  about doing  probably awful things  in the Congo  and Panama.  Yeah.  Anti-terrorism.  And,  Keith,  make sure you  match my socks up.  No, he's making sure  you don't have  racing stripes  in your underwear  after the laundry's done.  I bet you Keith  right now  is laughing  as he's biting  through your shirt.  I bet you Keith  spends a lot of time  crying alone 
[03:27:00]  when no one's home,  wife and the kids  are out,  and he's biting  a piece of cloth  and just weeping  while rocking  down the floor.  He's a psychopath  on some level.  The book,  once again,  Crush the Cell,  How to Defeat Terrorism  Without Terrorizing Ourselves,  Michael A. Sheehan.  Ta-da.  Hey,  Travis just ran this  in a quickie  before we get  to line of the day.  What's going on  with your tuna fish?  I'm horrified  watching Jimmy  try to open  a can of tuna.  You're trying  to open this can.  It looks like  a chimpanzee  trying to get 
[03:27:30]  into something.  It'd be easier  for me to eat  Ellen's pussy  than for me  to fucking  eat this tuna.  It'd probably  smell the same.  What happened,  Jimmy?  He can't use  a can opener.  I can't use  a fucking can opener.  Oh, here we go.  Ooh, ginger.  Watch yourself.  I am.  I'm going to cut myself.  Now it's only half open.  And then what do you do?  Why couldn't you  get the whole thing open?  Because I'm fucking  a bag of shit  with teeth.  Why?  Why a lot of things?  Why can't I fucking  function sexually  if there's love  in the room? 
[03:28:00]  There you go.  People seem to have  enjoyed the interview.  Thanks for the props,  peeps.  That goodness out now.  Thanks for the props  on instant feedback  and on the phones  and on PalTalk.  Hey, things that are  younger than John McCain.  This just came in  from Travis.  There's a website  called  thingsyoungerthanmccain.com.  Wow.  Of course there is.  John McCain,  for a reference point,  was born August 29,  1936.  So he's going to be,  what, 72?  72 years ago. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, my Lord.  Well, here's some  of the things that are  younger than John McCain.  The first one,  Obama's father  is younger than John McCain.  Right.  Not Obama,  Obama's father.  Chocolate chip cookies  are younger than John McCain.  Which was also  Obama's father's nickname.  Right.  That was 1937  when we invented  that goodness  called the chocolate chip cookie.  What did they eat  before then?  Yeah.  How'd you get kids  in the car?  Well, before that  it was Spam.  They ate Spam, Jimmy. 
[03:29:00]  Spam is also younger  than John McCain.  Wow.  Teflon is younger  than John McCain.  I would have thought  that anyway,  but I didn't think  Teflon was that old.  It goes back to 1938.  Bugs Bunny is younger  than John McCain.  But he did grow up  with him though  because Bugs came  when McCain was two.  So McCain grew up  on Bugs like the rest of us.  Watching little Bugs Bunny.  He sure did.  Thinking about those  happy moments  when his ass beat in.  The next one's going  to freak everyone out.  Uh-huh. 
[03:29:30]  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Also known as oil.  Oh.  Is younger  than John McCain.  Oil?  Oil.  Discovered by the Saudis  in 1938.  I did not know that.  Really?  Well, the discovery of oil.  Let's be honest.  Oil was there  before he was.  Well, yes.  The discovery of oil.  You're right.  What, um...  The La Brea Tar Pits.  Well, now wait a minute.  What were we using  to fucking lubricate engines?  Piss and shit.  Because, hold on. 
[03:30:00]  There were cars  and planes  before 1938.  Yeah, but that...  I think that...  And tanks  and fucking machinery.  What is that?  What the fuck  are you talking about?  We were...  We were just  putting dinosaurs  in blenders and stuff.  Nothing.  Oil's oil.  All right.  Diesel's refined from oil.  No, that's not.  It's like gasoline.  Where the fuck...  I don't...  I disagree with that. 
[03:30:30]  Than?  Thanikins?  I'm seeing that  there's the discovery  of oil in Qatar  around that time,  but I'm pretty sure  you're right  that we had oil.  Yeah, I'm sure  we had oil  before 1938.  Um...  Maybe Saudi oil?  I don't know.  Look, it's just  a dumb little list  to kill a few minutes.  I want it to be factual.  Factual!  Oh, boy!  My new bit,  which is called  Turn Off the Instant Feedback 
[03:31:00]  screen.  Today's reason  is Muffy McScrote  from Whackbag.  Yeah, I'm sure  you're on Whackbag.  He writes...  Z's...  Z's...  Lots of Z's.  And then he writes...  See, you weren't  listening yesterday  when we told you  how to do this  the right way.  He's off.  He writes...  From terrorism douche  to more Keith  the Top stories.  Time to switch to Howie.  Z's...  Oh, wait.  Then he did a smiley face  with a little blinky eye.  He's still a douche. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, that's a winky.  He's winking at me.  That means...  That means  take whatever you just read  and reverse it.  You know what?  He confused me.  Off of the screen.  How do we turn this off?  Here I get it.  And I should be off  at fucking...  It's 6.05 that should go off.  I think he's a fan.  All right.  Oil was first used in 1823.  No!  The discovery of commercial...  Like, commercial...  Saudi oil?  Quantities of oil, yeah.  But, like, where did Germany  get to build its huge war machine?  They weren't commercial. 
[03:32:00]  They were government.  In 1938.  By 38, they already had  a lot of hardware built.  But that's about the oil!  Look, the answer...  The answer is very simple.  Travis typed this out wrong.  He got fucking lazy.  Of course he did.  He's a girl.  It's basically...  Basically, because when we all  think oil, we think the Saudis  for the most part  in this day and age.  Yeah.  So, basically, what he should  have said, the Saudis...  Saudi oil.  Found their oil in 1938.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's what it says  on the website.  Thingsyoungerthanmccain.com 
[03:32:30]  All right, don't yell at us.  They went for the funny, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's say hi  to John and Queens.  Oh, no.  All right, nope.  Fuck John and Queens  up his ass.  I want to read feedback.  I don't want to look at, like,  meters going up and down.  Watch.  Do you really want it?  Wait, wait, wait.  Go silent.  Watch what happens  and then you talk.  The meters go up.  Don't talk yet!  I'm trying to tell the audience.  I want to get the meters  all the way down to here.  The meter goes up.  The audience can't see the meters. 
[03:33:00]  No, but we want the meters  to drop all the way.  The meters right now.  All right, okay.  All right, here we go.  Let the meters drop  and then we get them  to go back up again.  Okay.  Okay, let's watch them  go down then.  Hey, no!  We almost went down  at the bottom!  Watching the meters drop,  that's good radio!  Come on, we were almost there.  We were at minus 25,  whatever that means.  All right, here we go.  It means minus.  Shh.  Okay.  Shh, shh.  Ah!  That's your...  Head opener! 
[03:33:30]  All right, one more try.  They're dropping.  Oh, now they're not  because I said they're dropping.  Yeah.  Now they are.  Hey!  All right.  Things younger than  John McCain.  Plutonium.  Mickey D's is younger  than John McCain.  McDonald's.  1940.  Dick Cheney is young.  Wow.  Dick Cheney's younger  than John McCain?  Look at that.  By five years.  All right.  This freaks me out.  You can't have a president  that's older than 
[03:34:00]  Mount Rushmore.  Wow.  You can't have a president  that is older than  Mount Rushmore.  That's 1941?  1941.  Sure.  That's probably when  it was completed, my friend.  Took a long time.  They couldn't call it anything  because it just looked  like a bunch of shit.  It was just Mount.  And then finally in 1941  they went,  Mount Rushmore!  Yeah?  Ta-da!  They actually did call it  Big Glop of Shit  for many years. 
[03:34:30]  And the tourism department  hated that.  The Glop of Shit.  No one's going to want  to see Big Glop of Shit.  Yes, they will.  Obama's mother  is younger than McCain.  Obama mom.  We're almost done.  The Slinky younger.  AARP.  Israel is younger  than John McCain.  Wow.  Scientology is younger  than John McCain.  He's older than  a fucking snack food,  a religion,  a fucking country.  Yeah, you can't be  older than a religion  if you want to be  the president  of the United States 
[03:35:00]  of America.  The motherfucker  is older than the cookie.  Boys and girls  for many years  would just hold  hot dough in one hand  and little hot chips  in the other  and not know  what to do with it.  And they would  mush it together  in their mouths  and chew and make a patty.  I need to do something  with this goodness  that I have in my hands.  One day a mommy  figured it all out.  Yes, so she brought  out a pan  and she said,  spit that out.  Polio vaccine  is younger  than John McCain  and finally,  Alaska is younger  than John McCain. 
[03:35:30]  Well,  Alaska becoming  a state.  Alaska itself.  But if it wasn't  Alaska,  what was it?  It was just  shithole with  dummies on it.  Yeah.  It still is.  Yeah.  Hey, shithole with  dummies.  Get over here.  We're taking your  fucking place  and calling it ours.  Yeah, you can vote.  There's nine of you  fucking drunks.  50 caliber ricochets  hits gunner  in ear protection.  Yeah, Danny was 
[03:36:00]  selling this bit today.  Actually, it's a little  bit of audio.  I don't know.  I guess we're about  to hear exactly  what I said.  50 caliber ricochets  and I guess you could  hear it hitting the  gunner in the ear  protection.  Let's see what  this is about, okay?  Danny, is that right?  Pretty much nailed  that one?  Yeah, it's  actually, it's a  50 cal cannon  and it's like  propped up  and he's sitting  down with his  ear protection on  and it looks like  they've been  shooting for  like the day.  Like they went  out shooting  to a nice range  and this happened. 
[03:36:30]  That's the last  one of them  we're doing.  Am I bleeding?  No.  Go, go, go, go.  They've got you  right to the side  of your head.  For the hit.  Right in the  side of my head.  We're not doing  that anymore.  Nope, no more  iron.  Well, I couldn't  do that anymore.  God damn.  Wow.  You're not doing  that anymore.  You heard it go  pssshhh. 
[03:37:00]  It came in like  incoming.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  And it just  ricocheted off a  rock or something  that they were  hitting at?  Yeah, they were  firing at like a  rock face.  I don't want to  say like a mountain,  but yeah.  Is that it?  Oh, you got the  video?  You know, you  can even see the  shell come back.  That's crazy.  Wait, how far away  is he?  Is he a quarter  mile away?  God damn.  Yeah, that's  pretty far.  It bounced back a  quarter mile and  hit him in the  ear?  That's almost  impossible.  Bam.  Oh, holy shit. 
[03:37:30]  Damn.  His head gear  came completely  off.  It comes flying  off his head.  And at one point  the cameraman, he  reaches down to  actually pick up the  ear protection.  And for a couple  of frames, you  could actually see  unfortunately it just  passed, but you  could see the damage  it did to the ear  protection.  And those cans are  pretty heavy duty.  Where's this video  for everybody?  I saw this up on  YouTube.  If you just type in  a 50 caliber ricochet  guy hit in head with  50 caliber ricochet.  He did it on purpose?  That was a good shot.  Damn.  What are the odds? 
[03:38:00]  You wouldn't be able  to do that again if  you tried.  But if he wasn't  wearing that ear  protection, I mean, he  was dead.  Right.  That was death.  That's the actual  background on the guys  who made that clip.  What?  Steve?  I found the guys  who highlighted the  important part of it.  Sorry, I was just  telling you where to  start.  I found the info on  the guys who...  He's getting mad!  No, he's right.  He's right.  No, he was being a  wise-ass and I told  him exactly what I was  doing.  And you put him  right in his place.  I'm wearing a dickie.  Yes, thank you. 
[03:38:30]  That's his imitation  of himself.  Yes, exactly.  I want to pull his  shirt all the way  down to where his  shirt should be and  watch his little  shoulders slump.  Ouch.  This is uncomfortable.  Steve, don't do  that.  I'm uncomfortable.  Flow heat, Steve.  Flow heat.  You dry those on.  Is that true?  Yes!  I don't fucking  know these things.  How hot are you  drying them?  High heat.  Jesus Christ.  High heat for my  shirt.  I fold them.  There's no fucking  wrinkles left.  He pulls it out  with one hand.  It's stiff.  Steve, your clothes  are getting a little  tight.  Yeah, I know.  It says I gained  about fucking 30  pounds since I 
[03:39:00]  stopped training so  hard.  Why?  Why did you gain  30 pounds, Steve?  Because I fucking  stopped lifting as hard  after my shoulder  started hurting and  then I didn't stop  eating less.  Are you not eating  healthy?  Come on, tell the  truth.  I eat healthy until  about four o'clock in  the afternoon and then  I completely fall off  the fucking rails.  Did you just put your  hand up to Jimmy like  I don't know.  Well, he was telling  me he was doing his  no, no, no, no.  Because I was saying  that we know Steve has  gone through a rough  time personally.  It's like sometimes it's  difficult to fucking 
[03:39:30]  maintain everything.  Why are you eating  now, Steve?  Aren't you going to  stretch out your  stomach again?  Yeah, I puke a lot.  I puke a lot because  I was eating too much.  No, but if you eat  too much, can't you  actually stretch it  back out?  Yeah, you can.  Well, you can stretch  it back out but before  the actual stretching  happens, you vomit.  Really?  So I fucking wear out  the back of my teeth.  So I'm getting back  on track but I start  physical therapy today  so hopefully I'll be  back in the gym in a  couple months.  The real problem is  not the gym.  No.  The real problem is  psychological.  Is whatever little  Stevie C is dealing  with. 
[03:40:00]  Oh boy, little Stevie.  Another lonely man  in the room.  That's right.  This room is filled  with very lonely  people.  Filled with lonely  men.  Trying to fill in  the hurry.  We're just all  lonely men.  Shut up, fan.  When he was just  a small little  Steve C.  Yeah.  That's right, and  he got in the wrong  person's car.  Yep.  Remember that, Steve?  That almost  happened to me when  I was a kid.  You touched your  wee-wee.  Did it?  Did it?  Yeah.  According to my  mother, I used to  fucking get lured  away.  I almost came 
[03:40:30]  twice in my ass.  Oh, wow.  Implies he got  fucked and he came  and the rape was  complete.  You almost got  lured?  My mother has  told me on a number  of occasions when I  was younger.  I used to get  lured away to a...  I'm sorry.  I don't have  headphones on, so I  can't hear you  interrupting.  But a number of  occasions?  At least three  occasions she can  remember vividly  where I was  lured away by  strangers with  candy.  How molestable  are you, dumb  were you?  I was like 
[03:41:00]  three years old,  molestable, and  very dumb,  apparently.  Someone got  him.  Yeah, someone  must have  got three times  the charm.  He went to the  dance at least  once.  Mother knows  about three times  she had to stop  him from getting  in the car, but  one time she saw  him getting out.  That candy had a  cream filling.  Yes, and Steve  had little sticky  candy stuff on  his, but she knew  something happened  because he had  little sticky candy  things on his  fingers, yet he was  still crying.  Now what kind of  boy eats candy 
[03:41:30]  and is still crying?  Little Stevie,  what happened?  I don't know.  I have no  recollection of a  lot of events  pre-5th grade.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Oh, no.  Pre-5th grade?  Well, I mean,  there's a lot of  kindergarten.  Vividly.  Yeah, pre-5 years  old.  One minute he's  looking at a candy  cane, the next  minute he's 17.  I don't know  what happened in  between.  What do you think  that's about?  That's fucked up.  Most people know 
[03:42:00]  a lot of memories  before 5th grade.  I mean, I have  recollections, but  nothing very  as spotty as  the blood in  your underwear?  Yes.  Yes, old  tummy sleeper  Steve.  He was belly  sleeper Steve.  Is that where  that comes from?  I wonder.  It sure is.  Thank you.  He sleeps on his  stomach with his  head tilted and  his hands just  docile behind him  because that's the  only way he could  sleep with his  rump sore.  He had to tell  all his friends  he had a bike  accident.  I hit a pothole.  The seat popped  off. 
[03:42:30]  That's right.  And I went  in and out  for 40 minutes  and then I was  dumped back  in my front yard  with teeth prints  in my back.  With shitty candy.  The molester  didn't even have  good candy for me.  That's right.  Whenever you wanted  to cry, the molester  would just reach  around and put a  piece of sucking  candy in your mouth.  They gave you  nekos and Mary  James.  A piece of  sugar sucking  candy.  It wasn't even good.  Yeah, just awful  candy.  Let's think of how  awful the candy was. 
[03:43:00]  I'm going Mary  James.  Or Smarties.  Yeah, a little  package of Smarties.  Here you go, kid.  Thanks for the fun.  Or Domino's  sugar cubes.  Or a salt lick  of a fucking deer.  Brutally fucked  while licking  a piece of salt.  Brutally fucked.  Now you're hurting  my childhood, Jimmy,  because we were  very poor and we  had to suck on the  little sugar cubes  for treats.  Really?  Yeah, man.  We didn't have  all those cookies  and all that fun  stuff in our house.  Sugar cubes?  Yeah, I'd sneak 
[03:43:30]  the sugar cubes.  Maniacal little kids  running around  like crazy  on a sugar high.  Wonderful.  Let's get the  fuck out of here.  Line of the Day  is brought to you  by Cardscan.  Get all of your  contacts organized  in just a few seconds.  I know what's going  on here, by the way.  Will Chapman listens  to our regular radio  show, sees all the  clients that are  advertising on that  show, and he brings  them over to XM.  No problem, man.  It's actually  brilliant.  And we like this  thing. 
[03:44:00]  You get all your  contacts, all your  business cards, and  you put them into a  nice little system.  Yep.  Put them through.  It's so easy.  You scan the card,  but it doesn't just  scan them and stuff.  Then it puts links  on the phone numbers.  It just knows what a  phone number looks  like when you scan it.  It knows what an  address looks like and  the name.  So say you're looking  for something.  You could search the  whole database and  just put in Carpenter.  Right.  And then the car that  you slid in for your  carpenter comes up.  Yep.  It knows.  And then the  number's there.  Click on it.  Most client meetings 
[03:44:30]  we hate, but this  one we actually really  enjoyed.  I was very impressed.  It was very  interesting.  Very impressed.  We're like, how  the fuck does it do  that?  Because then it  knows the phone  numbers, and then  you just click on  that phone number, and  all of a sudden it's  dialing the number for  you.  Amazing.  Unbelievable.  Go to  Cardscan.com.  It really is.  Cardscan.com slash  radio, the number  one.  So radio one.  Don't spell out  one.  Fucking hate that.  You get a business  card, you got to  type it in your  Blackberry?  Yeah.  It's fucking 30  seconds wasted.  No? 
[03:45:00]  We're in a topsy-turvy,  get it done now kind  of world.  Someone is guessing it  was Pixie Stix.  The monster gave Steve  Pixie Stix after he  molested them.  I think it was wax  teeth.  It's like, don't  bite your tongue  while this goes  in.  Get some waxed  teeth, shit dick.  Jesus.  Ah, shit.  I bet you the guy  was a brutal fuck  too.  He would only pull  Steve's trousers down  a little bit, his  tough skins.  Oh, those little  tough skins. 
[03:45:30]  He had husky  tough skins.  Okay.  Look at that  fucking beautiful  rump pat.  Ooh.  I'm just watching  first time anal  while you do this.  Who?  It was up here.  What are you  talking about?  It was up there.  I don't know.  It's called  first time anal.  It was up on the  other computer screen,  so I clicked  to play.  Speaking of anal,  what the hell did  I just hear from  the other side of  the studio?  By the way, that was  me who fired this  morning.  I know it was.  Why wouldn't you  admit it?  Because it was fun  not to.  I always admit it.  I like not  admitting it.  It's been silent  for once.  Who is leaving the  Opie and Anthony  show at the end  of the month? 
[03:46:00]  Oh, she ain't happy  with that fucking  ass fucking she's  getting.  Will you put it up  on a bigger screen  for us?  I can't.  I can't.  That guy's awful  looking too.  Yeah.  Here is a runner-up  line of the day.  But then we learned  let's say somebody  you know works  for the airline  and they will have  some type of sodomy  with you.  The pass with a  hole drilled in it. 
[03:46:30]  That was a good one.  Let's go right to the  next runner-up line  of the day.  You couldn't possibly  have anything on this.  Yes.  It's a nice dickie  you're wearing.  Jesus.  Thank you.  How short is that  shirt?  I know.  I washed it.  What's the matter  with you?  I washed it.  Where'd you dry it  on, Venus?  One more runner-up?  That guy's giving  her ass a fucking  Wow, he is  pounding her ass.  I wouldn't know 
[03:47:00]  because I don't see it.  She is not enjoying it.  He's fucking that ass.  How do you know  it's the first?  He's pulling it  all the way out  and shoving it in.  Yeah, he's not  like, look at  he's just slamming it.  He's like  that guy doesn't  take any guff.  No.  How do you know  it's the first anal  though?  Because it says it  on the, look,  first time anal  so it means  it's got to be  the first time.  This guy is really  pounding her asshole.  I wish I could  fuck like that.  The break-in period  is pretty harsh  for this one.  The more she cries  the bigger your boner  gets.  What the hell, dude?  She's not happy  with this ass 
[03:47:30]  dicking she's getting.  That's right.  I'm happy with it.  Yeah, Bob Veal  is raping her.  That guy's awful.  I don't think  Richard from Survivor.  Yeah, he does  look like Richard.  Well, he's probably  used to ass fucking  but not on a chick.  Here's another  runner-up line  of the date.  I've been watching  that show Carrier  on Discovery.  It's a whole  documentary on that.  No, it's not  about you, Jimmy.  Ah, Carrier.  Ah, Carrier.  Um, line of the day. 
[03:48:00]  I better eat some gum  so I don't have  tuna breath.  Tuna.  That fucking can  of tuna was good.  I'm trying to eat  healthy.  You have enough  celery there?  I know.  I can't eat  but that's all  they sell it in.  Why would you?  I didn't want  all that celery.  What do I know?  Kenny's a celery.  Celery's good for  like one stalk tops.  That's what I told him.  Half a stalk.  How many?  He fucking lives  for celery.  His nickname's  the Celery Kid.  We all know that.  The Celery Kid.  You got at least  a pound of celery  there. 
[03:48:30]  What the fuck  are you going  to do with that?  I don't know.  It sounds like  his hair when it breaks.  Mr. Kenny's hair  sounds like  when he combs it.  A bunch of celery stalks  being snapped  over a ledge.  Here is your  line of the day.  Here comes  the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  7.8 on the 
[03:49:00]  Richter scale  doesn't move  this iceberg.  You're not doing  anything with  a little specking.  You have to pull  her hair.  You have to tie  her head to a horse  and then hide it  and watch the horse  take off.  Any kind of reaction  out of her.  It's jaded.  Poo!  That's too short.  Yeah, I know.  Someone's saying  maybe it's just me  but Jimmy's XM mic  sounds like he's  talking into a tin  can lately. 
[03:49:30]  No, that was...  Alright, that's  why the guy said...  How's that sound?  It was because  there were two mics  pointed towards you  at the same time.  That's all the mics  want, the goodness!  I know, but sometimes  we have to deny them  a little.  Talk to this one,  whatever.  I don't care.  Oh, and Steve  wrote back.  Yeah.  Jimmy's not going  to be happy about this.  What?  Steve wrote back.  I'll tell him  what I said.  A lot of that  has to do with  the fact that  Jim needs to work  on talking  into the mic  and not off  to the side.  Oh, no, you didn't!  I can't even argue. 
[03:50:00]  Steve raised a good point.  I just haven't been  as lucky as him.  Maybe if I had a hand  on the back of my head  all the time  I'd be better  talking into the mic.  Maybe we should try this.  No, you're right.  Steve's right, actually.  I was off mic.  They're just discussing  this on my email.  You don't have to  fucking CC me on this.  CC, blind CC, copy paste.  The person that started  this said,  I thought that might be it  but wasn't sure.  How do I need that email?  And it was quickly corrected  by your competent show staff.  Wow.  That's right.  They did run right in.  Bada beep, bada boop. 
[03:50:30]  You watch the talk.  And the first earl  was drilled in 1859  in Pennsylvania.  Oh, yeah.  And we got a...  Different dates.  I don't care about  the oil anymore.  Fuck the oil.  How do we run out of oil  that quick  when they say,  oh, we're like,  it's almost out.  We haven't.  They just don't want to  drill in certain places.  I hate trees.  Drill everywhere.  Drill everywhere.  No.  Trees are shit dicks.  No.  There should be...  No.  You got to save your part.  All over the ocean. 
[03:51:00]  Petrified forest.  A bunch of fucking  scared trees.  No.  Fucking knock it over already.  Boo.  Faggots.  What the fuck  do we need trees for?  Just make air.  Photosynthesis.  Really?  Photosynthesis.  Spies photosynthesis.  Remember I said this.  Trees are for queers.  I don't value  fucking plant life  at all.  It's shit. 
[03:51:30]  Hey, you're eating it.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I'm not eating plant life.  I'm eating some tuna.  And celery.  No, the celery was there.  The celery's just sitting there.  No one thinks about plant life  as life.  You fucking step on it  all the time.  If there were little  fucking baby puppies  on your front property  instead of grass,  would you walk all over it?  And cut it, yes.  And cut it?  I'm going to mow  the fucking grass  just as it's starting  to grow up and come of age.  It's starting to see  the world finally.  We have to mow it  with our mowers.  I want to see a baby sapling 
[03:52:00]  and fucking just  karate kick it.  I've always wanted to be big  just so I can fucking  bend trees with my foot.  Baby sapling.  Like a little one.  Just like a little sap  comes out.  The first apple  is hanging off it  and then I just  come over and break it.  But it's so happy  that it's finally  growing fruit.  A little sapling.  I know.  I can't do that  to the little fella.  You should see the look  on a tree's face  when I fucking  hook a handcuff  up to my fucking  trailer hitch  and I drive away with it.  Just rip it out  by the roots  and giggle. 
[03:52:30]  What do you think  of that, stupid?  Fucking hate trees.  So overrated.  Joyce Kilmer  was a fucking douchebag.  Fools were  poems were wrote  by fools like me  but only God  can make a tree.  Joyce Kilmer sucked.  How do you even  know that though?  That's a very famous  quote about his  shitty poem.  Stupid.  Fuck the trees.  You're right.  Birds hang out  and shit all over  your car.  It's not helpful. 
[03:53:00]  I hate blades  of grass too.  A blade of grass.  Yeah.  Just cut it all.  Make cement.  Fuck the difference.  Parking lots.  All front yards  should be parking lots.  Not a handier.  Exactly.  All your friends  should come over.  Park anywhere.  What happened  to those trees?  They were annoying me.  They were blocking  my view.  Fucking cut them  all down.  Pave the whole  joint over.  Fucking bowl  in the front yard  if you want to know.  We got to go 
[03:53:30]  I guess.  Yeah.  All right.  So I guess  you're enjoying  these wildfires  Jimmy if you don't  like trees.  I love them.  There's nothing  that makes me happier  than seeing a bunch  of black just smoke  where trees used to be.  I fucking love  like when you see  a landscape  and they're all  even all even  Steven.  Even Steven.  But look  it looks sad.  That's where  trees and bushes  and plant life  Exactly. 
[03:54:00]  What do they do  to stop the fire?  Trees beg for fire.  They really are.  I'd rather have  gas cans in front  of my house.  They're fucking  totally worthless.  How do they  beg for fire?  They do nothing.  Every year  there's fire  and every year  they just stand  there like dummies  and take it.  How about you  fucking  you drip a little  you save some  rain water or something  you fucking asshole.  They just drink it up  like dopes.  spit some rain water  back at it.  They just  they're built 
[03:54:30]  to be walked on.  Fucking birds  live in them.  Fucking like  bees hang out on them.  They make paper out of it  they do nothing.  We wipe our assholes  with trees.  Is that great?  Big mighty creature  that's what you get.  Anything that wants  to fuck with a tree  can.  They have no defense.  Fucking bark.  So they should  save some of the water  and keep themselves  nice and moist.  Of course they shouldn't.  Next time a fire comes  they fucking contribute  a little.  They're just waiting  for us to do  all the leg work. 
[03:55:00]  They just sit there  waiting for the fire.  Well they do.  They're probably just  shaking like looking  at each other like  is someone gonna help?  I cannot wait  to see that animation.  Alright.  God damn it for me.  We learned a lot today.  And now we have to  do it again tomorrow.  Yep.  Holy shit is this  getting old.
