<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Fun Fact Thursday, centered on cats’ supposed ability to sense death, fueled by listener anecdotes about their pets' unusual behavior, particularly their presence during intimate moments. This segued into a strongly worded dislike of birds, focusing on their perceived stupidity and lack of survival instincts.  A caller shared a story of his cat watching him have sex. The segment also included a fun fact about coprophagia in animals, and expanded to include discussions about rabbits and their perceived skittishness.

Next, Chris Cornell, lead singer of Soundgarden, Audioslave, and Temple of the Dog, joined the show. The conversation began with lighthearted banter about a show staffer, Bobby, eating blueberries, before transitioning to Cornell’s musical career, his solo work, and his views on songwriting and performing. He also expressed some embarrassment about earlier vocal performances. The conversation touched upon the Seattle grunge scene and bands like Nirvana, promoting Cornell's then-current solo album, *Carry On*.

The show then took a sharp turn to a discussion about the inappropriateness of a Titanic-themed inflatable carnival slide. This sparked a highly offensive segment where the hosts and callers generated increasingly tasteless ideas for carnival rides and games based on various tragedies and disasters, including the Columbine High School shooting, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr.  The segment concluded with a less offensive discussion about cats seemingly predicting deaths in nursing homes, again featuring listener anecdotes about their own cats.

Opie then recounted his experience staying at a dilapidated hotel he called the "Crack Hotel" after a late-night contract signing. He described the hotel's poor condition, a large mirror in his room, and his discomfort with the linens, noting he slept naked due to soiled clothing. This led to further raunchy jokes and listener calls. He read an article about Rush Limbaugh's contract, contrasting his own success with his unpleasant hotel experience.  Comedian Brian Regan called in, leading to a humorous segment involving mistaken identity and Frank Caliendo's impersonations of Brian Regan and Al Pacino.  The segment concluded with more listener calls and banter.

The final segment began with a discussion about adjusting Ben's microphone levels due to his inconsistent proximity to it. This transitioned into "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," encouraging listeners to display "wow" paraphernalia on their vehicles and referencing the explicit Pal Talk video stream. The hosts teased Opie about his dancing at F.H. Riley's, leading to listener calls and anecdotes about Opie's dancing at various events, including a past WAF event and a skateboarding bit with a body double, with a listener claiming to possess recordings.  The discussion shifted to President George W. Bush's apparent internet inexperience, focusing on his use of "the Internets" and "the Google," which the hosts and callers mocked extensively, imagining various humorous scenarios of Bush using online platforms like MySpace and YouTube.  The segment concluded with further ribbing of Bush and a return to the "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" theme.

[00:04:00]  Some people don't want you to say this, some people don't want you to say that, some people  think if you mention some things they might happen, some people are really f***ing stupid.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst.  And you're listening to the worst of O.P.  And Anthony.  O.P.  And Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  It's the O.P.  And Anthony Show.  Chris Cornell making his way into the studio.  You know, Bobby, Bobby never gets cut a break. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  He's on camera eating his blueberries.  And the comments that are coming through on Pal Talk, that you're not even chewing, you're  swallowing him like a duck.  You eat like a monkey.  Bobby looks like the Edge if he was stung by 10,000 bees.  Because he's got his black cap on.  I'm glad I can make you guys think first.  It's Chris Cornell.  How you doing, man?  How do you know it's Chris Cornell? 
[00:05:00]  Because I've seen you before.  Oh.  It's Chris Cornell.  One of the greatest singers in rock history right there.  That's what it is.  Thank you.  I've always said it.  I've always said that he's one of the best.  We've been huge fans, and that's why we're kind of disappointed.  We've got to at least acknowledge the fact that we've got a lot of equipment set up  because we thought you were playing today.  And there was a miscommunication somewhere.  We were just talking about that.  I don't know how the miscommunication happened, but I'll sing a little bit for you.  If I could put time in a bottle, then there's one thing I'd like to do. 
[00:05:30]  I'd put some time in the bottle, and then I'd have time in a bottle.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  I came for real.  Jim Croce.  Yeah.  I don't know how people like somebody says, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Chris will come in and sing.  And even I was like, it's kind of early for someone to sing. 
[00:06:00]  I know how it is to wake up and try to belt something out.  Yeah.  You know, especially with your range and vocal style.  It's not really conducive to morning singing.  Not really.  I mean, I've done it.  But you have to wake up even a couple hours earlier and sort of kind of take a shower and  sing a little bit.  Or stay up all night or something.  Well, that's sort of what I'm doing now.  I played a show last night and the night before at the Beacon.  Two sold-out shows at the Beacon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I've slept.  I've had about an hour of sleep right now.  That's why I don't really know where I am now. 
[00:06:30]  It is kind of.  And I'm singing Jim Croce before I am.  That's why that's happening.  I like your version better.  Hit time in a bottle.  Yeah.  Just to get it out of the way, the last time we saw you, you were in Audioslave.  Mm-hmm.  You were the lead man for Audioslave.  What happened?  Just time to move on?  Yeah.  You know, I had a solo career happening and that's sort of why Audioslave was able to  happen for me.  And it was an opportunity that came up.  And really from, since Temple of the Dog, I thought, and I want to keep my mind open  to cool, collaborative ideas. 
[00:07:00]  And it was that.  But we did three albums pretty quickly and I'm very proud of them.  Loved the albums and then just felt like it was time for me to move on.  Right.  And go back to my own world of kind of doing whatever I want.  I always thought you were your own person.  Like, it's hard for you to just stay in a band.  Maybe I got issues.  I was thinking about that.  Like, I get a little stir crazy.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  But you've been successful no matter what you've done, you know, with Soundgarden and  then the Temple of the Dog, which, by the way, I'm a huge fan of that album. 
[00:07:30]  Huge.  I can't get enough of it.  I was just jamming Say Hello to Heaven the other day.  Mm-hmm.  Just singing along to that freaking song.  And my vocals are nothing like yours.  Oh, don't sing along to that.  Nothing like yours.  And then what's your favorite song on it?  Say Hello to Heaven probably.  Say Hello to Heaven.  Yeah, yeah.  One, two, three, go.  No way.  And, oh, you're on.  No way, man.  I love when people, you don't understand how that is for a guy that has a range like you 
[00:08:00]  when people go, hey, could you sing that song?  Like, if you're a singer and people go, hey, sing that Soundgarden song or sing that, yeah.  You're like, no, you don't understand.  It doesn't just come out like that.  Yeah.  That's where the talent part is.  Sometimes when I put the mic, aim the mic toward the audience at the wrong time in certain  songs and stuff doesn't come back.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, Chris, man, we just can't do that.  It's not.  I realize, though.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  If it's like everybody say yay, they're going to come up with a yay, but certain parts of 
[00:08:30]  songs, it might not come back the right way.  Yeah.  The real high part of Say Hello to Heaven.  He has one of those voices that you actually think you can sing, like Journey.  You actually think you can sing that good.  Well, you've got to go into falsetto, so you've got no power at all.  But you think you're great.  Oh, you're singing like a little girl.  Say hello to Heaven.  Heaven.  That's pretty good.  And knows how to sing.  He can carry a tune.  He doesn't play, but Anthony knows how to sing. 
[00:09:00]  He really does.  I used to have a few bands back in the old days, you know.  You've got to hear his Neil Diamond, Chris.  Oh, fuck.  I'll sing Neil all day and all night.  All day.  Don't get me started on the Neil.  I heard about, like, I read something where you, when you first started singing, you actually  tried to figure out where your range was and really couldn't even find it.  It's that, you just kept trying to go higher and higher and you wouldn't crack?  I would sort of want to scream, you know.  There are parts of the songs that were written where it's just screaming. 
[00:09:30]  That's the part.  You know, there's a melody and then there's the screaming part.  And to scream, I would just sort of sing above my range and then your voice breaks up  and it gets all shrill and it's white noisy.  And we were working on a particular song called Heretic that the bass player wrote the lyrics  for and all he could do was scream, really.  But then it was decided that I was going to now sing it.  So I would scream that part and one day I kind of went really high to get my voice to  break up and there were like a whole bunch of notes up there. 
[00:10:00]  And that's kind of where it started.  And then I would come back a couple days later and there wouldn't be, you know.  And so it kind of, you know, some days I could sing the notes, some days I couldn't.  And then it was sort of on-the-job training.  We were a band for three years before we put out a record.  We played a lot.  And then we toured, you know, for years before really we started selling records.  That's amazing to me.  We did.  I was remembering now because, like, if I do three shows in a row, I'm kind of, you know,  that's enough.  A little shot. 
[00:10:30]  I need a day off.  And our songwriter and I remember we did 18 shows in a row.  Wow.  And I'm thinking, like, how did I do that?  18 in a row.  If you can do 18 in a row, you can do 365 in a row, I figure.  Yeah, yeah, right.  I mean, after about 10.  You wake up in the morning going like, uh-oh, can't do it tonight.  No way.  I didn't remember worrying about it too much.  Don't talk to me.  I feel like what I do now is much better than what I did then because I, you know, pay a  lot more attention to it, you know, and I want to, like, part of it is, like, people 
[00:11:00]  saying, well, this guy's a great singer and he was number whatever on a list of great singers  and over the years I've thought, well, I've got to kind of live up to that.  So, you know, I kind of try to make sure I'm in good vocal form.  And I don't know, I think back then it was a little more crazy and Soundgarden was so  loud that in some ways it kind of, if I sang the best I'd ever sang in my life, I'm not 
[00:11:30]  sure you would have heard it.  What about, um, Jesus, what the hell was I just going to ask you?  Uh, well, speaking of Soundgarden, you guys ever...  I hate when that happens.  Would you get back together?  I had a great question.  We do too.  Yeah.  Nah, go screw yourself, Bobby.  Where are you at with Soundgarden?  Would you guys ever, like, do a little something-something?  I don't think so.  You're done with them too?  Well, it's been 10 years now, and I don't, not once have I ever received a call or heard  of anybody wanting to get that going again, so... 
[00:12:00]  The fans, man!  That's who wants to get back together.  You guys had some great stuff.  Yeah, how long can time go by before it gets silly that you get together again?  I don't know.  I think it's so cool to not do it.  To just not do it?  Yeah.  It's a way, especially nowadays with everyone getting back together, it's a way of being  cutting edge.  We can, Soundgarden can be cutting edge by doing absolutely nothing.  There's a, sort of a genius in that.  We don't have to get up.  Do you do...  They're really ahead of the game, man. 
[00:12:30]  They're ahead of everybody.  You do Soundgarden tunes, a couple of them, when you play out?  Yeah, I do a lot of different songs.  Yeah.  The band I have out now is, like, really amazing, and I'm having an incredible time  with them.  We're doing songs from, I think the oldest one we've done is Off of Louder Than Love.  Um, and they play great, and then kind of everything from then on.  There's a lot of solo songs I did over the years from movies, and then...  You do Seasons?  Yeah, we do that.  Oh, God, I love that song.  From the single soundtrack.  Yeah, from the single soundtrack. 
[00:13:00]  Um, anything I want from Soundgarden, um, we do, we know, like, about three or four, um,  Temple of the Dog songs, and, um, we do a couple Audioslave songs, and then for my  two solo records, and, um, and then I do weird cover songs, occasionally.  You do Billie Jean.  I do that, yeah.  I was just hearing about that.  I haven't heard it yet, but I, I, I hear it's almost unrecognizable.  You do a different thing with it.  Yeah, it's very different, it's like, sort of gospel-y, it's actually a heavy song lyrically 
[00:13:30]  about a guy who, you know, gets involved with this woman who says, this is your kid, and  it's not his kid, and it's like, all we remember really is, it's a dance track, and he's walking  backwards, but it looks like he's walking forward.  And, um, I, I ended up doing that, because I, I had this period in the set where I do acoustic  songs, and I just started getting goofy, and like, trying to pick silly songs, or songs  you wouldn't expect, uh, um, to play, and just kind of freak the audience out, and I  thought, who would be really, like, the last person anyone would ever expect me to cover, 
[00:14:00]  and I thought Michael Jackson, but then when I kind of unraveled that song, and was reading  the lyrics, and I changed the time signature, and made it sort of gospel-y, it became really  kind of heavy, and, and I really liked it, and that's how it ended up on the record,  I just thought, you know, this is, it's a good thing to, like, remind an audience occasionally  that, you know, songs and music are really pliable and malleable, and, and we don't only  have, genres don't really exist like we want them to sometimes, you know, you can, like 
[00:14:30]  when Johnny Cash did Rusty Cage, I kind of learned a big lesson there.  Um, did you like it?  I loved it, and I remember Rick Rubin asking me to do an, you know, it was a  do an arrangement of Rusty Cage so that Johnny Cash could record it, and I thought he was  out of his mind, and I actually tried, like an idiot, and, and then called him and said  that, no, I can't do it, and then, he didn't do it for that record, he did it for another  record, and, and then I heard it, and of course, it, it went do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
[00:15:00]  do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, like every  other song, and then, and then the lyrics to Rusty Cage, like, oh, that's, that's how  you do that.  That's how you do it for Johnny Cash.  Now I get it, but people actually listen to the lyrics when he's saying them, and then  I would get phone messages from people saying, oh, and the lyrics to that song are great,  and I would think, well, why didn't you say that to me five years ago, because Johnny Cash  wasn't singing them, is why, and we listened to him, um, so it was like that a little bit.  You, uh, did you write most of the songs that are, you know, known as your songs, popular, 
[00:15:30]  sound garden, and I wrote a lot of the singles, I wrote, I think most of the songs we ever  made videos for, that kind of thing.  Yeah.  Like the outshine black hole song, fell on black days, do you, like, do you, when you  play those now, do you think like, holy crap, I can't believe I'm still playing this song?  Not really.  No?  And I'm not sure why.  I think because there's been breaks in, in that period. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, true.  You're not just out there pumping it out like that the whole time.  And there's so many songs, like, if you think about it, sound garden, especially the last  couple records, we could never agree on what songs should go on a record.  Um, so we'd go in the studio and record like 16, 15, 16 songs, and we couldn't cut it  down to 10 or 12, so we would just put them all on it, because that was easier than  trying to argue, um, so the, the last couple records were really like double albums, and  it's just because of the compact disc, we could fit like 78 minutes of music on it, and 
[00:16:30]  then when we put them on vinyl, they are actually double albums.  Um, so there's a lot of songs, and there are songs we, I've been doing, uh, songs here  and there that sound garden wrote that we never actually even performed, I don't think.  Yeah, it's probably different for like the Wang Chung guys.  I think they're probably like, I can't believe we're still doing everybody Wang Chung tonight,  or aha, take on me guy.  Kaja Goo Goo.  Are they back together?  My goodness.  That would be a great triple bill. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  I remember the, you know, the, the movie Live and Die in LA?  Yeah.  And they, and Wang Chung wrote the theme song to that.  Yeah.  It's called Live and Die in LA.  Live and Die in LA.  And the video was great, because they don't, they're not actually sitting with guitars and  kind of writing the song.  It's all, they're all just sort of writing the music, and there's a scene where they're  kind of looking at each other, and one guy writes a note on the sheet music, and then  they high-five it.  That, that was just the greatest video, 80s rock video moment ever. 
[00:17:30]  That's a great note.  Give me some skin.  It was so easy back then to make videos.  Okay.  It just needed a little fire.  Yeah.  And then some high-fiving over notes.  Yeah.  But as an artist, do you listen to any of your old songs and wish, oh God, I wish I could  redo this.  Like, there's a part in it where you, you just.  Most of it, like, the music and, and like the guitar sounds and what's going on sonically  in the parts, I, I think are like better than I remember them. 
[00:18:00]  And sometimes I listen to the vocal performances and, and that bothers me.  Really?  Not all of it, but sometimes, yeah.  Sometimes it sounds like it's somebody else or like I'm, I'm, you know, I've got some  attitude going in there that has something to do with more than just singing the song.  You know, it's like, it's not who I am now.  And, and.  Do you have an example of that?  I'd rather do that.  Wow.  A song we all know or.  There, there are parts of like the Louder Than Love record that bother me.  I don't really know if I could say what song.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Um.  But like something must've been going on in your head at the time.  Like maybe I'm, I'm just sort of forcing it a little bit.  Really?  You know, what I can do, I can do it, I can sing it, but it's like, there's something  going on there where it's like, like it's acting, I guess is the best way to put it.  Yeah.  I didn't notice it then, but all these years later, you know, with the experience that  I have making records and just trying to be myself, um, with a microphone in front of  me, I can hear that little bit of like, okay, there, here's a kid in there, um, screaming 
[00:19:00]  his ass off.  But there's like something in there that's not, you know, there's something in there  that wasn't entirely me and it's coming out.  Maybe it's tension.  I don't know.  There is something about, uh, youth that'll just make you do that, like balls out.  And there was a song we wrote, um, I wrote actually called cold bitch that ended up being  like a, a B side for something.  Um, and I had it, I got it on my iPod.  I took it off of Tom Morello's iPod and I hadn't heard it in years. 
[00:19:30]  And it starts out, it's very Zeppelin.  It's this big sort of cascading riff and it sounds so great.  And I'm just loving it and thinking, God, I wrote this song.  Then the vocal comes in and it's so high.  It's like, it's so embarrassing.  And I think that was probably like my masterpiece that never really came to fruition because I  was such an idiot.  I thought, okay, I've got this great range.  I'm just going to sing way up there.  And, and it's silly to me.  That was probably like 1991 or something. 
[00:20:00]  You would even think like that.  Like, Oh God, listen to me.  Oh, what an ass.  It comes in and it's just so bad.  Do you have any like stuff from way before you even started seriously playing, maybe  with just like friends in, in a garage or a basement that you listened to or, or would  go like, Oh, I couldn't even listen to that.  Embarrassing.  I don't know if I have that.  Maybe like when you were really younger, like almost 80s-ish stuff maybe.  I started out as a drummer and there are probably some tapes of me playing drums on stuff. 
[00:20:30]  Not much though.  Yeah.  But it wasn't very good.  That's for sure.  I do remember that.  No singing though with some real hokey dopey lyrics or something like that.  No, I was always a genius songwriter.  Soundgarden was my first band.  I mean, there was some songs.  Soundgarden's his first band.  That was my first band where I sang.  Oh, you suck.  It's true.  That's great, man.  Otherwise it was drumming in like bad 80s bar bands.  That's why Soundgarden happened because like I ran into two other guys who kind of were having  the same experience.  Like, wow, if we're going to be in a band that we like, we have to kind of do it ourselves. 
[00:21:00]  And that was when I actually picked up guitar and bass and started writing the lyrics because  I thought, if we're going to have good songs, we kind of have to do it.  We can't wait for somebody else to show up.  Who was in the band when you were the drummer?  And like, where are they?  Do you?  I have no idea.  No idea?  I was in probably 10 bands from 17 to 21.  Do you know what that's like to like, be like, dude, Chris Cornell was our drummer.  Yeah, they're still talking about you.  Oh, they're still talking about you at a party somewhere. 
[00:21:30]  They're sitting there Saturday night at the bar going, dude, let me tell you, our drummer  was Chris Cornell.  And they're like, yeah, shut up.  Yeah, shut up.  I was the singer, man.  I was the singer.  Shut up.  It's your turn to get around.  You're the top eight on MySpace.  Shut up.  We're up.  We're up.  It's darts time.  Yeah, I used to have a great way of quitting those bands, too, which is I would say, and  very sincerely, I would say, you know what, I just don't think I'm, I really am good enough  to be in your band.  Oh, that's sweet. 
[00:22:00]  That's a great idea.  You guys are just a little bit, because I was really young, too.  Everyone was always older than me.  Holding you guys back.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  And they would always look at me, you know, thinking, I don't know if this guy's telling  us to do that.  That was the only way I could do it.  But really, as a drummer, I thought, I had this romantic idea that if I practiced and  worked at it hard enough, some amazing band would just kind of roll through Seattle and  go, that guy's so great.  We want him to be our drummer. 
[00:22:30]  And that didn't happen.  At least not in Seattle.  I mean, it was just never going to happen.  Yeah.  And Kim and Hero, the co-founders of Soundgarden I met, one was the bass player and one was  kind of the fill-in bass player for one of those bad bar bands that I was in.  And I met them that way.  And neither of them liked the band, and neither did I.  But we ended up starting a band together because we decided, well, we're going to have to,  you know, figure out a way to be in a good band and we're going to have to write songs. 
[00:23:00]  And if someone else can do it, why can't we do it?  And then we spent like a couple years writing songs.  And we had those, like, initial young band kind of awkward songs that had good parts  but were sort of overdone and some of them were kind of silly.  And there was probably some embarrassing stuff in there.  Were you, like, influenced by anything at the time?  Because Soundgarden is known to be one of those bands during the grunge period that was  like, you know, wow, this is a standout band. 
[00:23:30]  How did, because it was a complete change of music.  It went from that 80s hair stuff to the stuff you guys were doing.  Like, what changed that for you?  How were you able to take that 80s stuff and completely get it out of your head  and get into this new music?  It's just so odd to me that.  We were kind of in or wanting to be initially in what was a very healthy U.S. indie record scene  at the time, which had bands like Black Flag and Bad Brains and Who's Could Do and Sonic Youth. 
[00:24:00]  And the one wrinkle that we put on it was, and maybe it's because Seattle was always sort of  a guitar-based kind of place, we wanted to include 70s rock influences that we liked.  You know, riff rock, old school, not necessarily like the 20-minute guitar solos and things like that,  but heavy rock that we liked from the 70s, which was not really allowed.  Since punk rock, that was sort of not cool. 
[00:24:30]  And I think that was a big part of what happened with Seattle, was just a mixture of influences.  Like, we took aspects of older arena rock that were good and mixed it with more modern kind of post-punk music.  And it just took a few years for people to realize, oh, wait, that's okay.  There are elements of 70s rock that are great.  And what happened with hair metal was they sort of, like, they would see Led Zeppelin 
[00:25:00]  and they would take, like, the kimono and the dove and the light show,  and they would forget about the fact that it was the best rhythm section in any rock band ever.  They would concentrate on, okay, Robert Plant had a really high range,  so they would just find a singer that could sing a high range  and forget about how great the riffs were or the melodies or the music.  That was all sort of left behind.  And I think for us, we just didn't want to completely abandon music that we liked, 
[00:25:30]  so we sort of put it in there.  And we were not always loved.  We were sort of hated for a while.  Really?  Yeah.  I remember playing, like, Vancouver, Canada, and, like, ashtrays whizzing past my head.  Jesus Christ.  Because I always thought of those as good shows, though.  We felt like.  Of course.  If that's happening, maybe we run to something.  We know something they don't know.  Yeah.  I think that was it because, like, not being in Seattle at the time  and that kind of being the epicenter of what was going on, 
[00:26:00]  you guys were ahead of the curve as to what, you know,  was going to kind of take off in the country.  You kind of saw it building there.  And the rest of the country and Vancouver apparently had to kind of catch on.  Yeah.  I always thought of it as, like, you know,  you got this white snake video with the guy whose model wife or whatever  is doing the splits on a variety of jaguars, right?  And it's kind of what hip-hop does sometimes,  which is separating the artist from the audience 
[00:26:30]  and, like, basically throwing it in your face,  like, you ain't going to be me and you're never going to have her.  And then you see, like, Smells Like Teen Spirit,  which is probably a catchier song in the pop world  with youthful aggression, but with three guys.  One guy's, like, 6'9", one guy's, like, 5'5".  And they just look like the same people that you go to high school with.  I think that was the key factor in, like, this tremendous cultural shift 
[00:27:00]  was, like, okay, we don't, you know,  seeing a video of Motley Crue coming down in the helicopter is kind of cool,  but this is cooler, and this is what we've been missing.  Unattainable.  Yeah, exactly.  That was, you know, that was rock and roll.  Yeah.  It just seemed to happen so quickly, too.  Which is proof.  Like, really.  And the fans do that.  Record companies don't do that.  There is no kind of marketing that can make that happen like that,  that quickly.  That was literally, like, a whole bunch of young rock fans 
[00:27:30]  that said, oh, this is what we've been wanting.  Being in that atmosphere in Seattle,  were you as taken by Smells Like Teen Spirit as the rest of the country was?  How that was kind of like, wow, what the hell's going on here?  I remember Ben Shepard coming into Soundgarden rehearsal  before they had even made that record,  and said, yeah, I saw Nirvana last night.  And he got the name wrong.  He said, they had this song, Smells Like Teenage Spirit.  It's amazing.  I think it's going to be a huge hit. 
[00:28:00]  Which is weird hearing him even say that.  And that was probably, like, eight months before it was recorded.  But it was like that.  You know, they would play in front of 100 people.  And that was around the time when that talk started happening.  Like, you know, it's not just an indie scene.  This is something that can be, like,  new rock and roll for the masses kind of thing.  And then you got the pissed off fans that were there from the beginning  going, sell out, man. 
[00:28:30]  Always.  What are you doing, man?  Sorry, people like us.  What can we do?  Yeah, you liked us, but the other people aren't allowed to.  Is that how it works?  Because everybody kind of wants to think they're a little cooler than everybody else.  So if other people start liking you, it's like, wait, I thought I was too cool.  Yeah, exactly.  No one's that cool to like these guys.  Exactly.  It happens.  We got to get Chris out of here so he can sleep.  Yeah, go to sleep, Chris. 
[00:29:00]  It's Chris Cornell.  The solo CD is Carry On.  I tracked through it last night.  It's awesome.  Thank you.  Very, very cool.  Even though you didn't play, we love having you in.  You're a great conversation, man.  Thank you.  Really cool to talk to you.  Next time I'll play, I'll get some other Jim Crow sheet.  Yeah, do that.  What is the don't mess around with Slim?  Yeah, don't.  What are some of the big hits before he died?  Bad, bad Leroy Brown.  There you go.  Oh, that was super great.  You know, he's the baddest man in the whole damn town.  He's actually good live. 
[00:29:30]  If you see him doing that stuff live, he's great.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Chris Cornell, always a pleasure.  Thank you.  It's Carry On, his latest CD.  Check it out.  She was more like a beauty queen from a movie screen.  Said, don't mind, well, what do you mean?  She said, I am the one who would dance on the floor and around.  She says, I am the one who would dance on the floor and around. 
[00:30:00]  People always told me, be careful what you do. 
[00:30:30]  Don't go around breaking your girl's heart.  Mother always told me, be careful who you love.  Careful what you do before the lie becomes the truth.  Billy Jean is not my son. 
[00:31:00]  She's just a girl who says that I am the one.  But the kid is not my son.  She says I am the one  But the kid is not my son  Forty days and forty nights 
[00:31:30]  The law was on her side  Who could stand when she seemed to man  Her schemes and her plans  Cause we danced on the floor in the hall  So take my strong advice  And remember to always think twice  Do think twice  Told my baby that we danced till three 
[00:32:00]  She looked at me  Showed a boat on my baby  He cried his eyes  Well I find  Who would dance on the floor in the hall  People always told me  Be careful what you do  Don't go around breaking your girl's heart 
[00:32:30]  Then she stood right by me  The smell of sweet perfume  She had been much too soon  But she called me to a room  Yeah  Billie Jean is not my lover  She's just a girl  She says that I am the one  But the kid is not my son 
[00:33:00]  She says I am the one  But the kid is not my son  I am the one  A man  You  can tell me  You ...  Yeah  A man  Who  You  A man  A man  Who  A man  A man  Who  A man  Who  A man  Who  A man 
[00:33:30]  A man  A guy  Who  A man  A man  Who  A man  Who  A man  A man  By  The king is not my lover, she's just a girl, she says that I am the one, but the kid is not my son.  She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son. 
[00:34:00]  So take my strong advice, and remember to always think twice, do think twice.  Damn, it's Opie and Anthony.  I love boobies.  Wow.  Very eyes really, don't you agree? 
[00:34:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  How would you do that?  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, this is Chris Cornell, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, so the Titanic ride, Anthony?  Yeah, now you finally saw this.  We had talked about this beforehand, and I can't believe this is not an outcry.  We saw the website and everything, and I think there was a little article in the paper. 
[00:35:00]  I have to tell you, when we were discussing this about a month ago, or even longer, I thought it was kind of a goof.  No.  No, it's at carnivals and fairs.  I'm driving home.  I'm outside Huntington, and somebody was throwing a kid's party.  And they had the Titanic slide set up, and kids were sliding down it.  It's this big inflatable slide, and it's shaped like the Titanic, but it's only a half of it,  because it's tipped up the stern way up in the air, way up in the air, and it looks like it's sinking into the ground. 
[00:35:30]  That's right, Anthony.  And the kids climb up a little ladder, and you're able to slide down the decks of the Titanic,  just like the horrified, real-life human beings sliding to their death in the icy waters of the North Atlantic,  bouncing off of the stacks, and when they get down, they go, I want to go again. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  And they climb back up and slide down.  I saw a couple kids bouncing off the smokestacks.  Bouncing off the smokestacks.  This is something that really happened.  Yeah, it was a long time ago, but thousands of people died in a horrible, horrible way.  And now it has just come down to, if enough time goes by, not only can you joke about it,  not only can you talk about it without having to be all somber, but you can now make a carnival ride out of it.  Right.  Look as the little children climb up to the slanted deck of the Titanic 
[00:36:30]  and slide down with smiles on their face, not unlike the real passengers with big smiles on their face.  Oh, wait, no, those were screams of horror.  But instead of getting done with the slide and going and maybe getting some ice cream,  they would just freeze in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic.  This song I dedicate to the survivors of the Titanic and to all the little children, 
[00:37:00]  like the one I was finally able to get with my impotent husband, Rene.  We froze some s**t.  I was still able to impregnate myself.  The doctors put...  F**k!  Where?  Waaaaah!  I was still able to impregnate myself with Rene's frozen s**t. 
[00:37:30]  The frozen s**t bouncing into my egg,  much like the Titanic bounced into that iceberg on that dark night.  in April of whatever f**king year that was.  And the people sinking slowly into the icy waters,  much like Rene's frozen s**t slammed into my ice-cold eggs. 
[00:38:00]  I think so.  But it all comes down, when you add some years,  it can be made into a carnival ride.  This goes to the many women that lost their lives on the Titanic,  and mostly, it is dedicated to...  survivors.  I am Zam Fear, Master of the Pan Flute. 
[00:38:30]  Try the TWA Flight 800 Flume Plunge,  where we light the children on fire and send them plunging to their deaths.  Also, the Hiroshima Fun House.  Is that really my shadow?  What is it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But disasters can be fun,  just like the Titanic. 
[00:39:00]  Make sure you join us for Columbine Paintball.  It's great.  You'll run into a high school that looks just like Columbine.  Two people with trench coats chase you with paintball guns.  It's so much fun.  Hey, I'm good. 
[00:39:30]  Hitler's Haunted Bunker.  Laugh along, both Gentile and Jew,  as you go through Hitler's Haunted Bunker.  Why?  Hey, enough time passed for the Titanic.  Where's the line?  See, I'm making a point here.  There are plenty of disasters.  Let's all ride...  Raid makes a great point on line eight.  Raid, what's up?  Hey, how you doing? 
[00:40:00]  Your kid slid down the Titanic slide.  Yeah, last year at the Sussex County Fair,  my son went down that,  and the funny thing is before he gets on,  they're like,  hey, you can't come on here with your sneakers on.  You've got to take your shoes off.  I'm like,  this isn't bad enough taste as it is,  but the kid's got to take his shoes off  to pretend he's dying on the Titanic.  That's great.  Do they have old people to trample over  and push out of the way  like they did to the lifeboats?  They should have, like,  hire old people on the deck of the Titanic 
[00:40:30]  to push out of the way.  squirt them with a hose  till the old bastards drown  in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  I wonder if they hose down the kids  with really, really cold water  before they shut down.  Hose them down.  Oh, God.  That is awful.  That's great. 
[00:41:00]  We also have little games  for them to play at the carnival.  We have Jean Benet Ramsey whack-a-mole  where you beat her over the head.  Larry, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  And enjoy the food.  It's the Donner Party Buffet.  $4.99 a person.  What about the Shondra Levy  hide-and-seek game?  Oh, now that is truly in bad pace.  Oh, yeah, not enough time has passed by. 
[00:41:30]  See, I'm not learning.  The fun part,  she never gets to yell,  ollie ollie oxen free.  Because she's dead.  Larry.  Yeah, yeah.  I came by a farm and picnic the other day  coming back from the store  and I saw this thing  and I saw this ship  and I said,  what is that thing?  And my wife says,  I don't know,  it looks like a ship  and I thought it was cast a plane  and when I drove by it,  I said,  oh, that's the Titanic.  The Titanic ride!  For the love of God! 
[00:42:00]  And if the kids are too young  to play on the Titanic ride,  remember,  you can go in the  William Shatner kiddie pool.  Bill Shatner will stand as lifeguard  and do nothing as you drown.  Oh, my God.  Allegedly.  Look at that poor little bastard  struggling for his life.  I'll just stand there  and call the cops  and about oh and oh.  Anthony, what's going on? 
[00:42:30]  Anthony.  Oh, this guy's got a great line.  Anthony.  Yes.  Go.  I want to know  if they close the gates  to all the poor kids  and let the rich kids go first.  They lock him up  in the bilge.  You look in the lower portion  of the Titanic ride.  There's poor people  down there  covered in coal dust.  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Listen, you forgot about  the Susan Smith car flume  which goes into the water  with the kids in it. 
[00:43:00]  Hey, why not?  Now people are going to be like,  now that's outrageous.  But how much time has to pass  before it's in good taste?  Well, it actually reminds me  of another game  that I thought was really fun.  It's the Oklahoma City bombing game.  And if you win the game,  you're carried away  by a crying fireman.  It's awful.  But I mean,  why is the Titanic  any different?  Why the hell  can they make a ride out of it  just because enough time  went by  that you make a ride?  Could you imagine 
[00:43:30]  a Flight 800 flume?  Come on.  Today's lunch special,  Sharon Tater tots.  Yes, the Manson experience.  The little kids  get the clown  like Charles Manson  to paint their faces up  with little swastikers  on their head.  Bob writes,  I can't wait for the  Puerto Rican Day Parade  lawn sprinkler game.  Those aren't water weenies.  Let's go to Greg. 
[00:44:00]  Greg, you're next  on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, and hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Congratulations on syndication.  Oh, yeah, that's happening.  Thanks.  Yeah, don't forget  the Paula Poundstone slumber party.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, see?  Well, that's too new.  That's horrible  that you said that.  Much too new.  Well, you get the point.  Whew.  And of course, yes,  the Ted Kennedy log flume.  You go with your girl,  but only you come out. 
[00:44:30]  And you can win  a JFK Jr.  Kewpie doll.  Oh, wait,  they really have that.  Did you see this?  In the post, yeah.  JFK Jr.,  little Kewpie doll.  The Danbury Mint  putting it out.  It's little JFK Jr.  saluting  like he did  at his dad's funeral.  He looks like  one of the Beatles  in that, doesn't he?  Not the one  with brain cancer.  Thank you, Mark.  You know what,  Ryan, I want Anthony  to the Rockaway Beach  wave pool?  Oh, God. 
[00:45:00]  Nice.  That was on.  That's still on the cover  of the New York paper.  That's why I'm here, baby.  That's horrible.  Tragic.  Three girls drowned  in Rockaway Beach.  It's just a ride.  My God.  You know,  the lifeguards are sleeping.  I don't know what happened.  That is awful  because that's too new.  You have to wait  maybe 80 years from now.  They make a ride out of it  because that seems  to be what happens.  There's some great ideas  for kid games on the phone  so we might have to go  right to the phones  after break here. 
[00:45:30]  Join us at the  Phil Hartman Shooting Gallery.  Oh, no.  Ding.  Ding.  Ow.  That hurt.  God, I wish I knew  her name,  the Houston Mother Dunk Tank.  God, I can't remember  the name.  Five kids in the tub.  You might remember me  when I was alive.  Sorry, Jay.  Hits close to home,  doesn't it?  Okay.  I still feel bad  about Rockaway  wave pooling.  Yeah, well, you should.  I'm like,  those are someone's kids 
[00:46:00]  and I just said  that person could be listening.  We're making a point here.  There was a point  to be made.  The Titanic ride  is no different  than any of these  other tragedies.  It's inappropriate.  Thank you, Jay.  All right.  We better take a break.  There you go.  And we'll be back  with the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm real excited.  Real excited.  Let me see.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  W-X-R-K-New York. 
[00:46:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What do you got over there, Jimmy?  Jimmy was kind of chuckling along  at something.  I'm just,  I'm looking at this death cat.  Oh, the death cat.  Oh, rules.  Story of the day.  Oscar the cat.  How do you not love  Oscar the cat?  What a creep.  Here's what I got on the cat. 
[00:47:00]  This is your story of the day.  Yeah, story of the day.  I don't know why  we're doing it so early,  but it's okay.  Cats have nine lives,  but do you meet the cat  that can apparently predict  when you'll die?  Oscar lives at a nursing home  in Providence, Rhode Island.  Doctors notice that  when he curls up next to a patient,  that person is likely to die  within four hours.  Oscar has done it  in 25 different cases.  That's what they say.  So many of the people  on the staff 
[00:47:30]  have begun calling  family members  once Oscar lies down  next to someone.  Now that cat  can stay in Rhode Island.  Yeah.  That is a creepy story.  They say the cat knows,  though,  but there's got to be  some kind of behavioral thing.  Like the cat notices  whenever an orderly  walks out of an old person's room  buckling his belt.  Oscar runs.  And going for the pillow closet.  Maybe Oscar's killing them.  All of a sudden,  some cat has been  taking out life insurance  on dementia patients. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, the cat curls up  at the person  over its face.  Just suffocates them.  They find a bunch of cat hair  in their lungs.  I know.  Well, you know what it is  that they forgot to mention?  This is the cat allergy hospital.  Like people who have  horrible breathing allergies.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe they're just  deathly allergic to cats.  It's the animal dander.  Yeah, well, you know,  Ant's really good at stats.  What do you think this is about?  I think a lot of people  are dying in this place. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Because they're old.  And the cat goes around  and lays with everybody.  And occasionally they die.  Well, old people,  they're dying.  Parts of their body  are dying all the time.  Rotting off.  Just rotting off.  So you think the cat  is attracted to like  I don't know.  Corn chip toenails.  I had to bring that one back.  It's back all Thursday.  But you missed it  the last two weeks.  Yeah, I know.  I'm trying to bring it back.  What the hell is that?  What do you think it is? 
[00:49:00]  Is that the death cat?  Listen.  Aw.  Sounds like something's  wrong with the equipment.  Can't we get a better cat noise  for the story?  What is that?  That's a cat noise?  He's purring.  I was ready to yell at Tim  to come in here  and adjust the microphone.  when something's going wrong.  There you go.  Aw.  Do we need cat noises?  Well, no.  We don't, Jimmy.  I think...  No, we really don't.  Isn't it weird, though?  All of a sudden,  I'm Jim,  the wisdom of Jim.  The cat comes in.  The old person's sitting there. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Right?  They're sleeping.  And...  There's a cat.  And the orderly comes in.  And smashes the old bastard  in the face.  He goes to hit the cat  and he misses  and he hits the old person.  Shoo!  Oh!  Call the family.  Call the family.  The cat is setting them up.  Like, every time the guy swings,  he just gets out of the way. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Is that cat angry?  I...  Shoo!  Shoo!  Sorry to inform you.  The cat predicted it.  No, I don't know why  your grandfather's face  is caved in.  It's actually...  It's a 300-pound male nurse  in a catsuit.  It's one of those  angel-of-death  homoerotic guys  who doesn't know he's gay 
[00:50:30]  just smothering people  with a...  Saving clippings  of the people's death notice  on his wall.  I was helping them.  He's a plushie.  A plushie.  He's a plushie.  That does some of that...  Yuffing?  No, not yuffing.  What the hell was that term?  Yuffing?  Having sex on the...  Not on the internet.  In virtual reality situations.  All right.  Well...  He had such a bad case  of Alzheimer's  that his head  seems to have imploded. 
[00:51:00]  Quite the problem here  at the old folks' home.  Hey, one of my old  hair cutters,  he...  Yeah, and it was a he.  No surprise there, right?  He said he could tell  when old people  were going to die.  Yeah.  They would come in  and get their hair done  and he knew  they were going to die.  By their hair?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe the cat knows  something about that.  I think cats can probably  smell death on you.  Like, if you're going to  die in four hours,  the cat's probably like...  But why would the cat  cuddle up to someone  that's going to die? 
[00:51:30]  That's creepy.  I don't know.  Why do cats eat feces?  They don't.  Cats don't eat feces.  Sure they do.  No, they don't.  They clean themselves.  Exactly.  Okay.  But they lick like,  you know,  areas on their little cat bodies.  Or they look for a puddle  and help themselves out.  But no,  they don't.  One leg over the ear.  No, they don't.  Make eye contact  thinking while they're doing it.  Come on, stupid.  Come get a kiss later.  No, cats will eat  their own puke, Jimmy. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, okay.  I've never seen that either  because cats don't really  vomit that much.  They do hairballs.  I used to get the hairball  and go,  and then they go,  and lay it out on the floor  in a little strip.  I used to have two cats  and one cat would puke  and the other cat would eat it.  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  They're German cats.  You ever have  a good time with yourself  and have an animal watch you?  Only when I make him 
[00:52:30]  stay in the room.  What?  Are you insane?  E-Rock knows.  He's laughing.  No, E-Rock doesn't know.  Why are you laughing then, E?  Because you don't do that.  E-Rock's the animal  in the room watching.  E-Rock,  he actually sets up  little stuffed animals  around his bed  and he makes them look.  He talks to all of them.  Dude,  if you're going to do that,  with yourself,  you clear the room  of any living creature.  Hey, man,  if a cat jumps up on the bed  and then is staring at you  wondering what the F you're doing,  there's a lot of guilt there  because you're convinced  that the cat 
[00:53:00]  is now thinking  like a human being.  They're looking like,  what are you doing?  Oh, like I'm the only one  that was in that situation.  You got to,  but you got to,  you clear the field.  You clear the field.  I strap,  I used to strap my cat  in like Clockwork Orange  and hold his little cat eyes open.  Play some Ludwig van.  And he'd be like,  what are you doing?  I don't get it.  See,  I'm screwed today  because I know  I'm not the only one,  but the phones are jammed  with Phone Call Thursday.  Ah, see?  See, now I can't.  My point.  Yeah,  my peeps can't get in  to back me up here. 
[00:53:30]  I don't think so.  But yeah,  every once in a while,  you know,  having fun with myself  and there's a cat  that jumps up on the bed  and now is staring at me  like I'm a freak.  I will admit  to having sexual relations  and having an animal  sit there  and look at you.  Sure.  But not alone.  But do you?  When you're alone,  you control the situation more.  You can go,  you know,  nah, nah.  You got to do it  behind closed doors.  So in your situation,  now the cat is staring at you.  You ever get,  you ever like look the cat 
[00:54:00]  in the eye  in the middle of this  and go,  no,  and go,  oh God,  this cat thinks I'm a creep.  I grab the water squirt bottle  on the side of the bed  and just blast them  right in the face  and then continue  to do the same thing  a little later  to someone else.  The best is like,  the best is  the little cat's brain  is trying to like  figure out  what the F are you doing?  Because it looks silly.  And why can't I do that?  It looks silly.  Now, you know what you do  after things are done  and you're ready  to doze off,  that little cat  is so handy.  It's like,  ah,  why get up  and go like,  come here, 
[00:54:30]  come here.  And it's like,  he doesn't know.  The worst thing,  no,  the worst thing  about a cat  being in the room  during that  is the fact that  there's only a couple  of things  that are really moving  like a cat toy  and you do not want  them taking swats at it.  I think you're  having fun with them.  Yeah.  You don't want to hear  that right before  glancing,  just blinding pain.  That's the only 
[00:55:00]  cat noise I enjoy  that you do,  Jimmy,  by the way.  That's the frightened,  angry hiss  right before those  back claws.  Oh,  he's mad.  He grabs with the  front claws  and his back claws  do that dig kick.  Oh,  they do that little  kick thing.  Isn't that adorable?  No,  it's cute.  You scratch their belly  and they grab your hand  and bite it  and then their back legs  go,  and leave these  just long scratches.  Oh,  it's adorable.  Hey,  Ralph from Jersey,  he writes every day,  I will back you up,  Ope. 
[00:55:30]  It happened to me  yesterday with my cat  looking at me,  very creepy.  Yeah,  there's a creepy look  that the animal  will give you  if you look him  right in the eye  while you're doing this.  And then at that moment,  you're convinced  that your animal  is actually human.  Why would you do that?  No,  no,  why would you do that though?  You're supposed to  like be,  if you're going to do that,  you've got to be alone.  No animals in the room,  nothing but some,  maybe a movie  or a magazine.  And when you need  to go down that road,  you're not like preparing. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah,  you do.  You just,  a little bit.  You just go.  Just,  what are you,  hang out in the kitchen  and just decide it's time?  Just go.  Thad is stepping up  to a microphone.  Oh.  Yeah,  when I used to live  with my girlfriend  and her cat  would come and stare at me  because we only had  one computer  that was in the living room.  Not a computer,  of course.  The cat was probably like,  is he all of a sudden  a teacher?  Why these photos?  Go ahead.  He'd try to come over  and do the old leg rub. 
[00:56:30]  Oh,  yeah,  creepy.  So then you're kicking  and trying to watch it.  Yeah,  the creepy cat  will attempt to get involved.  Like start rubbing up  against your leg  and stuff like,  yo,  hey,  this is my time.  Then you get mad  at the cat  and doesn't know why.  It's just confused.  It's like,  hey,  get out of here.  Oh,  thanks.  See,  I'm not alone on this.  Thank you.  My ex-girlfriend 
[00:57:00]  years ago  had a cat named Jingles.  Little Jingles.  Jingles was spastic.  He would walk literally,  it was like watching  two animals walk  in one body.  The left leg,  the right leg,  he was spastic.  He had like  dandy walker.  Like he had muscle jerk  problems.  He was awful.  He hated me  and I hated him.  So one time  she and I  were on the bed  and let's just say  that I turned  at the very end  and old Jingles  was looking confused  at his own back. 
[00:57:30]  Did Jingles get in the way?  My arm,  no,  on purpose.  He was on the floor.  Oh,  God.  But let's just say  1965 civil rights footage.  Old Jingles got a lesson  on how handy  it would be  to have someone  who will  get your back  there for you.  Don't you wish  you could reach Jingles?  I hated Jingles.  Hated him.  Obviously.  And he hated me.  But that was  very satisfying.  I taught him a lesson  in who really is  the boss around this house.  You can scratch me,  but you can't get that  off your back,  can you, bub? 
[00:58:00]  Poor Jingles.  It sucked.  Tammy,  I don't know where  she's writing from,  but she writes,  I'm a woman.  It happens to me as well.  I've seen cats  that peep through the window  and I'm in the basement.  So she's doing  what she's doing  in the basement  and these cats  are peeking in the window.  Of course they are.  Maybe it's a statement  about our hygiene  coming from all  over the neighborhood.  The Gortons of Gloucester 
[00:58:30]  fisherman is looking  in there too.  It's awful there's gulls  tapping on the window.  Hey, let me in,  let me in.  Deadliest cast members.  It's awful there's  a sushi chef peeking in.  They're just lined up  for blocks.  It's Fun Fact Thursday,  right?  Who can tell anymore?  It's Fun Fact Thursday.  George from Providence,  he writes,  Fun Fact, 
[00:59:00]  according to ancient times,  people thought cats  were guardians of hell.  And that they would  take your breath or something?  Oh, that's like something  that they say  that cats do to children.  They'll climb up  on their chest  and get their mouth  close to the child's mouth  and suck in their breath.  Of course that was  from Cat's Eye,  Stephen King.  Yeah.  But, yeah.  But I think he got that  from like an urban legend.  And they could take  your life force  or your soul  or something. 
[00:59:30]  Cats just get this rep  because they got  very independent personalities,  you know?  They're not like dogs.  Unless you're  my little cat,  little Jack Jack.  He's adorable.  Wait till you see him  when you come over  my house  after your book signing,  Jimmy.  Jack Jack?  That's what I'm going to do  when I see him.  No, you're not.  Yeah.  Hey, we got something  on the cat.  Hi, Jackson.  Yeah, so did Jimmy.  We got something 
[01:00:00]  on the cat  getting close  to the old people  before they die.  Yeah.  Yeah, Gary from  Medicine, New Jersey.  As a person  is about to die,  usually septosemia  starts setting in  and animals have  the uncanny ability  to smell it in the air  right through the skin  of the soon-to-be  departed.  What is septosemia?  It's when you start  rotting,  I would believe.  Well,  septo from the  Latin septus.  Septo meaning nine.  And, uh, 
[01:00:30]  what was the other one?  Septo meaning nine.  It's always a number.  I don't know Latin.  Septo.  Well, septo is your  septum is your nose  and a septic tank  is,  it stinks.  So you stink up  your nose.  No, no, no,  but I'm saying sept  is probably a nose.  I would at this point  love to go back  to a phone call Thursday.  Well,  I was just speculating.  I know.  A bunch of men  talking about Oscar the cat.  Yeah, well,  Crisco writes,  my boyfriend's cat  comes in the bedroom  sometimes when we're  being intimate.  It gives me the creeps, 
[01:01:00]  but I don't want to  stop to kick him out.  How awful is that  if you're banging a chick  and all of a sudden  Oscar curls up.  You're like,  oh, I better hurry up  before this gets creepy.  I would love Oscar.  I would try to get him  to come in.  Maybe my girlfriend  had been fighting.  Every night before  I went to bed,  I'd go,  come on,  just sit next to her  for a little while.  Brad from Port Jefferson,  Long Island.  Oh,  I definitely agree with you,  but it's not just cats.  My dog will walk in  and stare at me  when I'm doing my thing.  It's very awkward.  Dogs are worse  because they're bigger. 
[01:01:30]  I think they're,  I think.  Yeah,  and they could like  jump up on the bed  and kind of look  and they're panting.  There's a snack is coming.  I think dogs and cats  are creepy  and I think they're pervs.  I think birds  have no effing clue  when it comes to this stuff.  Birds?  Yeah.  They just try to land on us.  Birds just have no,  no clue.  That's a stupid pet anyway.  Sure it is.  Like Jimmy's mentioned  that before.  Mwah!  Mwah!  They don't know what,  it could be noon.  They have no survival instincts. 
[01:02:00]  It's the middle of the afternoon.  All you gotta do  is throw the towel over  and those idiots  think that night has come.  Night time,  go to sleep.  Chirp, chirp,  chirp, chirp,  towel.  How did you evolve  if you're that dumb?  How do you not sense  there was no dusk?  All of a sudden  you're just like,  well,  the sun's out,  that worms chirp,  chirp, chirp,  towel.  Oh,  he despised birds.  Just worthless.  It's a loving animal.  You have to clip  its transportation mode  or it leaves  and forgets you're alive. 
[01:02:30]  Just awful.  I never thought about that.  Isn't he beautiful?  What's that on my windshield?  He's so nervous  he does both at the same time  while he's moving.  Every other animal  has to read a paper  and dig a hole.  It would absolutely be like,  well,  I have to hobble my dog  so he doesn't leave.  You have to cut his feet off.  Take those little pads  off the cat feet  so they can't leave.  So he has to lay there  with his little dumb legs  standing like a Civil War soldier. 
[01:03:00]  Hate birds.  Just disloyal dinosaurs.  They really are.  They're the final,  the skeletal leave  very close to Tyrannosaurus Rex.  They're the final  ancestors of dinosaurs.  That's what they turned into.  60 million years  you ran the planet  and now you're a little douche  in a cage  with a paper under you.  How does that feel?  And they're too stupid  to realize that  your little cage environment  isn't the jungle.  They have no idea.  You just put one little  dumb thing in there  and they think they're  in the jungle still. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah,  they got a little cocky  with Jurassic Park.  That's where we came from.  Look,  potware.  Towel.  Towel,  towel,  towel.  And all you need to do  is put a mirror in there  and they think  they have friends.  Yeah,  yeah.  It's just the worst.  Hey,  you talking to me?  Hey,  hey,  you talking to me?  He's a real good pal of mine.  He does everything I do.  Look,  when I eat my little seed,  he does the same thing  at the same time.  Hey,  what are you doing?  That's my food.  Yeah,  I'm going to peck at you.  Oh,  he's pecking at me  at the same time.  I can't get a good pecking. 
[01:04:00]  He seems to anticipate  my every move.  Ow.  He's going to kill himself.  Oh no,  it's just a window.  Dopes.  You know that bird  flying in your house?  Panic,  panic,  panic.  It's inside,  panic.  Get a hold of yourself.  The door's open,  you retard.  Panic,  panic,  panic,  panic,  panic.  Fly into the curtains,  panic.  Window.  Ow.  That's just dopes.  Just fly in circles,  fluttering their idiotic wings.  Do you not look out the door? 
[01:04:30]  God almighty,  do you not sense the breeze?  Beat it.  That is horrible  trying to chase me.  I'd like to grab a bird  and then just punch  its little face.  Just hook it.  I love your bird,  right?  Shoo,  shoo.  You open up the doors,  every door,  every window,  you open it up,  try to show them  and they're just  still panic.  And then he stands  on something  and the wings just go  flutter,  flutter,  flutter,  flutter,  flutter,  flutter,  and he doesn't move.  He just flaps his wings 
[01:05:00]  like he's shooting something.  Flutter,  flutter,  flutter,  flutter.  But he never gives up.  You have to kill him.  Maybe he's not even  trying to fly,  he just assumes  he is flying  because the wings are moving.  He's trying to carry the lamp,  he's trying to steal it.  He's a bird that needs drugs.  He's trying to ampsgrade  with some furniture.  Flutter,  flutter,  flutter,  flutter.  Towel.  That's the best way  to get a bird out of there  is just take a towel  and you swing the towel  and you mess the air up  so it crashes into the wall  and then you kick it out the door 
[01:05:30]  and scream racial epithets at it.  But us humans  are just as stupid.  You get a bird or a bat.  Show us that we're not.  You show us the door  and we leave.  You get a bird or a bat  in your house,  you'll destroy half your house  trying to get it out.  A bat,  all right,  a bat is different.  Birds,  you're just like,  oh,  I got to get this out of that.  A bat in your house,  you're constantly thinking rabies.  Yeah.  Or,  half your house is destroyed  by the time  you either kill the damn thing  or it gets out a window.  Or just the rats  with the rubber wings. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Awful.  Look at the s*** wings.  Hey,  bag back,  get out of my house.  That's what I like to do.  If I see a bat in my house,  I'll just grab a certain part of myself  and stretch it like bat wings  and he thinks  it's one of his pals.  Yes,  he thinks it's a bat  with a helmet  coming to attack him.  A bat with two tumors  in his wings  and then he comes swooping  to ask,  what's the problem?  It's the long-nosed tumor bat.  And why is that tumor bat drooling? 
[01:06:30]  That tumor bat nests in a cave  and then stinks to high heaven.  Let's go to Eddie in Philly.  Eddie,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  good morning.  Good morning.  So listen,  my cat,  when we've got,  when we're kind of like  rocking it on,  I'm rocking it on the couch  in the living room  because it's all open,  I can't keep anything out.  Yeah.  The cat will actually like 
[01:07:00]  scope it out  and then jump up on the couch  and watch the adult-oriented  theme television.  Yeah,  this is what I didn't explain,  I guess.  When I was,  you know,  doing what I was doing,  there was no cat in the area.  Like the cats like  sniff that crap out  and they're way too curious  and then they stare at you  all creepy  as you're doing your business.  He runs in from the other room  and he like,  he runs real fast in  from the other room  and he like,  like I got my feet up on the table  and he literally like 
[01:07:30]  creeps down under the table  and like stares up between my legs  like a little Kilroy.  And he makes sure  he makes eye contact with you  like,  Yeah.  Because he wants to call you a creep.  But he can't talk now,  can't he?  Daddy,  what are you doing?  Right,  right.  I was like,  ah,  jeez.  Hey,  I got a fun fact  for Fun Fact Thursday.  All right.  When a cat,  when a cat or any animal  actually eats its excrement,  that's called copaphagia  and bunnies actually do that  to get the nutrients  back from their food.  Yeah.  Do they? 
[01:08:00]  Is that a fun fact?  Yeah.  Yeah,  bunnies suck.  That's why their noses  are always twitching.  Like,  ugh,  can I just eat that?  Like to grab a rabbit  by the throat  and just throw it right now.  You know,  it's just twitch,  twitch,  twitch,  twitch,  twitch,  twitch,  twitch.  I hate rabbits  because they're the cutest things  and it's like you just  go to touch them  and they're like,  argh,  I just kind of panic  and look.  Will you relax?  I'm petting you.  They're so skittish.  They come out in your yard.  They're out in the suburbs.  You guys are city dwellers.  But I'm out in the suburbs. 
[01:08:30]  Oh,  we got rabbits.  There are bunnies  all over the place  and they go in your backyard  and they're just twitching their nose  and you try to walk over to them.  You can't get within 15 feet.  15?  I was going to say,  you can't get within a quarter mile  of these panicky people.  Before they just freak out  and run away.  Maybe because they've seen  their friend's feet  hanging off the thing  you open the front door with.  I'm like,  well,  this can't work out well.  He's got a point.  He's not even wearing it properly.  He's just throwing it in his pocket  if we're close to the door.  Plus, 
[01:09:00]  they have no natural defenses.  At least they can't.  Rabbits have nothing.  They have to rely  on the adorable factor.  Like,  the only reason we don't kill them  is because,  oh,  look at how cute it is.  They're too cute.  But bears don't have that  and dogs don't either.  No teeth and claws.  Yeah.  All right,  we got to take a break.  We're off to a great start today.  Learned a lot about animals today.  So far,  so far we've taken care  of phone call Thursday  for the most part.  We'll take more phone calls.  I would hope so.  We've had a few fun facts.  Yes.  Fun fact Thursday.  Extreme male camel toe Thursday. 
[01:09:30]  Who's up for it?  Did Kenny do one yet?  What?  Did you do an extreme...  What?  Did you do an extreme  male camel toe yet?  What?  After the break,  David?  No,  but I was thinking  of calling in a phone call  for phone call Thursday.  Did you say phone call again  in that session?  I was thinking  of phone calling in  a phone call.  I was thinking  of calling in  a phone call  for phone call Thursday  to call.  Call, call, call.  Yeah.  All right.  Just to call in.  Could someone just put 
[01:10:00]  a blanket over his cage  so he goes to sleep?  You know,  I don't like to be  the bear.  I'm like...  And I just want to say  that cat is awful  suspicious if you ask me.  Yeah?  Yeah,  I don't like it.  You think he's a perp?  Yeah, yeah.  You think he's  something up with that cat?  Doing the deed.  I truly believe  that cats are aliens.  I think they were  brought to this planet  years ago.  No offense to Jack-Jack,  but I just like cats.  Jack-Jack is the best cat.  Does he declawed? 
[01:10:30]  No.  I clip his little nails  with a nail clipper.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  Little Jack-Jack.  Hold that thought  because we're really late.  Clip his nails.  We've got to take a break.  Hold that thought  in a noose with a rope.  Yeah.  Okay,  it's Opie and Anthony.  Learning.  Oh, I think I saw boo!  Oh my God!  God damn!  About Wednesday.

It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:12:30]  Blah.  All right, so someone asked about the four-foot pen with Ken Stevens, our boss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's official.  We have signed our contracts, Anthony.  Yeah, we did that right after the show.  Right after the show.  And then we boozed it up with the boss, telling all sorts of fun stories.  Oh, yeah.  So after our little get-together after the show yesterday, it was getting too late to  jump on a train back to Long Island, so I have to stay in the city. 
[01:13:00]  You stayed in town last night.  Got to do it.  But I wasn't prepared to stay in the city, as you will notice by the same clothes I'm  wearing today that I did yesterday.  Now, Opie, Manhattan, New York City here, very hard to get a room at the last minute.  A lot of people like staying here.  Right.  There's a hotel I frequent, and I just figured they'd have a room for me last night.  Right.  Oh, they were sold out.  Uh-oh.  They were sold out.  Now I need to find a new hotel.  And I'm a little buzzed and a little tired, and I just need to find a room. 
[01:13:30]  So you didn't want to start making calls and find in other hotels?  So I went to the Crack Hotel across the street.  I can't believe you stayed there.  Ben was mortified.  You stayed at the Crack Hotel?  Ben prides himself on knowing New York and knowing where the hip clubs are.  Yeah.  He'll tell you where all the cigar joints are.  He knows all this crap.  I know.  And if you need a good room. 
[01:14:00]  He knows where the hip hotels are.  He knows which hotels you should stay away from because, you know, as Ben said, the sheets are filled with your head.  I didn't say it, so don't dump out.  Ugh.  So, uh.  Ugh.  So, I was tired, and my, you know, no rooms in the hotel I used, so I went across the street to the Crack Hotel.  Nothing worse than knowing that a Hasidic Jewel fouled a hooker there about an hour before.  This place is such a dump. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, such a dump.  And I'm in the lobby, and you get all these, you get all the rubes from all over the place that are coming to New York for the first time.  And they, they, because this hotel is, uh, close to Times Square, they're assuming it's a good hotel.  Because the lobby looks good.  Yeah.  It's Art Deco, Anthony, I believe.  Oh, yes.  Art Deco.  Yeah, they make the, the lobby look, uh, look good.  That means they just haven't remodeled it since Art Deco was new.  These people have no clue what the rooms look like until they get upstairs, and they're, they're in for a rude awakening. 
[01:15:00]  Here's the key to toilets down the hall.  Sheets are ten bucks extra.  It's bare, it's, it's one step above that.  Yeah.  Seriously, we had, there's a rotary phone, there's a rotary phone.  A rotary phone?  In the room, um, right next to the bed, huge, huge mirror.  Uh-oh.  Huge mirror.  That's a bad sign.  You could see Opie asleep in his hotel bed on the internet somewhere. 
[01:15:30]  Huge mirror.  Ridiculously.  Yeah.  I mean, it was the, it was the whole wall.  After signing his very lucrative contract, Opie decides to spend in the tens of dollars on a hotel room.  Staying here in midtown Manhattan at the Flush Crack Hotel.  No expenses spared as man batter stains abound.  In this luxurious crap hole. 
[01:16:00]  You'll know what you've gotten yourself into when you grab the sticky doorknobs.  And that mirror next to the bed, full of video equipment.  And for a special surprise, open the closet, you'll see a dead hooker.  Freshly killed.  The Crack Hotel. 
[01:16:30]  You just signed your contract.  Let me get this straight.  It's right after the show, we just signed our deal.  Yeah.  Feeling pretty good about ourselves.  Of course.  And you stay at a Crack Hotel.  Basically, I, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Air conditioning was busted, so I'm sweating all night.  Oh.  Oh.  Sticky sheets.  I, uh.  Located near the Carnegie Deli for all your pot needs. 
[01:17:00]  And I also knew that I had to wear the same clothes today, so I wanted to keep them nice  and fresh for today.  Opie's wardrobe never getting in the way.  Right.  Look at this closet.  Full of nothing.  So he wears the same cigar-smelling shirt he wore last night.  And my underwear and my socks.  I didn't want to sleep.  I didn't want to sleep in that stuff.  I hate sleeping naked.  What? 
[01:17:30]  Had to.  Had to.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Had to sleep naked.  Don't like sleeping naked.  Had to sleep naked.  When it caused the HIV in that bed.  Oh, my God.  Beware of hepatitis B.  Dude.  Wait a minute.  Had to.  Why?  Had to keep the undies fresh for today.  That's all I had.  What are you doing in your sleep that wouldn't keep them as fresh as when before you slept?  Well, you know, you sweat a lot during the day.  Had to kind of, you know, rinse them out a little bit and put them on the heater. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, God.  It's like a soup kitchen in your pants.  You're a pisser.  Wait a minute, but remember the sheets.  The undies, you know, they kind of look like used shoeshine rags.  So I had to, you know, take care of stuff.  I would have slept.  Had to.  In my clothes.  In the bed.  Shoes.  Everything.  I, no.  The AC, I finally got it to work and I got it blowing up some air to kind of keep my clothes  fresh.  Airing out the clothes. 
[01:18:30]  The sheets didn't fit the mattress.  So I woke up in the middle of the night just sleeping on this crappy mattress, sweating  like a pig.  Oh, my God.  Wait, the bare mattress?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, you got a disease.  You have a disease.  It was the worst.  The W, you know, outside my window.  Where most hotels serve crabs in the dining area, Opie got his in the bed.  All this and complimentary bloodstain removal. 
[01:19:00]  A place to hang your underwear while you sleep naked in our Petri dish bed.  All at the Crack Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.  Ben thinks.  Any straight pubes? 
[01:19:30]  Ben thinks.  Ben thinks that this hotel is used by all the hookers.  The drive-by hookers that we were talking about a few weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No doubt in my mind.  And, yeah, the W was flashing outside my window all night long.  With neon light.  Oh, pfft, pfft, pfft.  Right.  He's like, oh, I can't even get to sleep.  So then I wake up in the morning just drenched in, like, sweat on the mattress.  Just think if you were in there with a hooker of what they did before that. 
[01:20:00]  Leaving all kinds of body fluids.  Body fluids abound in this luxury suite.  So I go downstairs and I get the paper.  And I go back upstairs.  And I'm reading about us in the post today.  Did you put the paper down on the floor so your bare feet wouldn't hit the right?  Right.  And I had to laugh because...  I have to laugh.  There's an article in the post about Rush Limbaugh signing his contract for $250 million.  That's right. 
[01:20:30]  And our big boss saying that he would have doubled his salary if he would have called him.  I think Mel was joking, but...  And then they talk about some of the infinity properties.  Yes.  Some of the infinity syndicated shows.  And they mention the Howard Stern Show, iMIS, and radio's fast-rising dynamic duo, Opie and Anthony.  I'm reading this in the crack hotel this morning.  Laying in a crappy bed covered in your own sweat with the light blinking outside your window. 
[01:21:00]  Reading how you're one of radio's dynamic duo.  Right.  Up and coming stars.  I'm like, man, I might as well just have a freaking needle in my arm.  Look at this place.  Watch out for the syringe.  Oh, man.  I had to laugh.  I'm reading and, yeah, there I am.  That is something, man.  After signing his lucrative contract, he took off his underwear and retired. 
[01:21:30]  I had to rinse out the underwear first.  In front of a big mirror.  Who knows what's behind it?  All kinds of wonderful video equipment.  As you were watching the porno movie in your room, you were the porno room.  Movie in 315.  You checked the TV guide. 
[01:22:00]  What's naked radio personality?  Let me click that.  Hey, hey.  Room service.  No room service.  Look at my hair.  Look at that.  I had to, like, I don't know.  Yeah, it's looking, like, kind of greasy.  Yeah, because it was the hotel shampoo and not even the good guy.  Oh, no, it probably wasn't shampoo.  Oh.  That whore just beat me.  Beat me out of my money.  I'm going to get the next whore.  That tri-tub.  Tony.  How you doing?  All right.  What's up?  Yo, how come, Opie, you just didn't sleep in your drawers and then free bag it today? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, why didn't you free bag it?  All right.  That's the safest, dude.  Why didn't you free bag it?  Anyway, you looked at it, though.  You know, I had to take care of the undies.  What, dude?  No.  They were hurting.  Dude, you could have at least, at least, at the sun in that big deal, go out today after,  you know, taking a shower and buying a pair of underwears.  You only would have had a free bag maybe for an hour.  Right.  I went to the Gap and bought a brand new shirt.  You could go to Dwayne Reed and pick up a package of underwear.  You could have done that.  You sleep in your underwear last night to just set up some kind of perimeter around your junk. 
[01:23:00]  Do you guys understand that I could not continue wearing these underwear?  Well, I'll tell you this.  I took a girl to a hotel like that one time.  They were horrific.  Were they really a disaster area?  There was police tape around it.  Oh.  What happened?  You threw a puddle on your bike?  You know, it's like I'm the only one.  It was a hot day yesterday.  You're sweating like a pig as you're walking around and stuff.  You know, things happen.  Working up a lather.  Things happen.  Like the horses that pull the little wagons out here around Central Park on a hot day. 
[01:23:30]  They work that foam up.  Were you working up the foam?  Well, uh...  There must have been hundreds of dingleberries in that bed.  Oh!  Just think everyone must say that.  Oh, man.  This is filthy.  I'm going to take my underwear off.  It was, uh...  And you're just like...  You might as well have just been...  Dude!  You know what's going on in those beds?  You know what was going on in the underpants?  Butterscotch comes to mind. 
[01:24:00]  Put it this way.  If you walked in...  If you walked in that room, right?  Yeah.  Let's say you walk in the room.  There's a naked man in the bed.  He gets up.  Leaves the room.  Would you lay down in that bed?  They changed the sheets.  Oh, not at that place.  Not at that place, dude.  They had a Jamaican lady, like, you know, working the floors.  How about you said the sheets didn't fit and they kept sliding off the mattress and then you wake up and you're on bare mattress.  And how many guys do you think that happens to?  I don't even want to think about it.  Everybody.  Very thin pillows.  Oh, the thin crack pillows. 
[01:24:30]  It wasn't even a blanket.  It was just a spread.  No, wait a minute.  Now here comes another thing.  Spread.  Was it just one spread when you walked in the room?  Sheet spread.  Under the sheet.  Spread over the sheet.  There was no, like, top thing that you always throw off the bed the second you get in a hotel because those are the drunk people that just have sex instantly on that?  That was a spread.  That's what you used?  What are you going to do?  I need to be covered.  Oh, my God.  You have a communicable disease right now.  Right now.  No. 
[01:25:00]  You've got to lock up your genitals in your underwear.  I just needed a room.  It was late, and I had a crash.  And I'm reading about how we're the up-and-coming radio stars from my room at the Crack Hotel.  Oh, great.  What an image.  Opie's sack frothing like a cappuccino from Starbucks.  It looked like someone dropped a mochaccino in your pants.  So, there you have it. 
[01:25:30]  Wow.  What a paradox, huh?  Yeah, it's funny.  People think we're doing so well, and it was pretty pathetic last night.  You were at the Crack Hotel.  Crack Hotel.  Why don't you go to the park or something?  It was right down the road.  Well, I checked out of the Crack Hotel.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You checked out?  Yeah, I didn't check out.  I'm going to stay somewhere else tonight.  Oh, you're staying in tonight, too?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:26:00]  Check out.  It's called fleeing the area.  I still got to find underwear for tomorrow, but...  I'm serious now.  Have you checked yourself for crabs?  You really have to...  Look.  Don't even start that.  During the break...  Please, listen to me.  Don't even start that.  When we go to break, go into the bathroom, really look around...  I would know by now.  No, no, you might not.  Look, look, please, you've got to check, because if you spread crabs throughout this studio...  I'm not going to spread crabs!  We're the dynamic radio duo. 
[01:26:30]  Just check.  You think the dynamic radio duo would get crabs?  Crabs are like kryptonite to the dynamic radio duo.  My God.  Ziggy's laughing at you right now.  I've got a better place than you.  Try explaining that STD to your girl.  No, serious.  I caught these scabies from a crack hotel bed, I swear.  I have no STDs, and I have no crabs.  Thank you very much.  Check for crabs.  Get in the bathroom, check.  Dude, shut up.  You never know.  I'm doing it for your own protection and everyone else's.  You never know in those beds. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, my God.  I had a slight itch.  Oh, my God, don't scratch.  Gross.  Oh, my God.  I'm fine.  But it was an interesting night, to say the least.  And then reading about us in the paper while I was in that situation, I'm like, man, what  the hell?  Reading about us in an article that contains figures like 25 million and huge radio companies,  and there you are in the crack hotel in my own sweat, naked, because I'm still waiting  for my underwear to dry. 
[01:27:30]  He walked in there.  The crabs, like an amusement park, just sat down.  Come on.  All right.  The fleece circus.  Well, you know what?  Screw you guys.  I'm never sharing again.  F you.  Well, you can share the stories.  Just don't share anything you bring back from these rooms.  Get your balls out.  Flap your ass up.  It's today, though it may not be anyone's birthday, and it's not near the 4th of July. 
[01:28:00]  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  Oh, la, la.  Oh, la.  Too much for one man to handle.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Hey, this is Nicky Six. 
[01:28:30]  You're listening to the worst, I mean the worst, of Opie and Anthony.  Sorry.  And Matt wants to say hi to Brian.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, Brian Regan.  You're awesome.  Thank you, Matt.  Yeah, I have kind of two questions for you.  All right.  The first one is, I haven't been able to find your first TV yet.  Is it in, like, Tower Records?  I don't know if it's there.  If you went to, like, Amazon.com, it would be there.  Okay.  Or Napster. 
[01:29:00]  Well, that's true.  My second question is, do you run a website somewhere?  Yeah, you can just get it for free if you want.  You know, you can get it on Amazon.com, or if you don't want to pay any money, you can  always download it on Napster.  The free is always better.  Well, they do it to our CD.  Actually, you know, we don't even care.  I don't care either.  It gets our name out there, you know?  When people told me that, I was, like, so flattered, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, the Metallica thing, I can understand their gripe, you know? 
[01:29:30]  They have a point.  But when I heard that I was on here, I was like, man, that's fantastic, you know?  Hey, do you run your own website anywhere, like stupidpeople.com or something?  Not yet.  So you may have one.  I have the domain name.  That's the only step I take.  You own BrianRiggan.com.  Yeah, I spent the 75 bucks or whatever it is to get the name, and that's about all I know  how to do.  It took me, like, eight months to figure that out.  I'm going to go get your stuff from Napster, then. 
[01:30:00]  I'll book you later.  I don't think you heard the first part.  Amazon.com.  Amazon.com.  That's if you want to pay.  Matt, seriously, Tower Records usually has it in the comedy section.  I've seen it there many times.  And Borders.  Borders.  And Borders?  Okay.  Borders, I never thought to look there.  It's a great CD.  We play clips from it all the time.  Here's one of my takes on Napster that I heard.  It's an upgrade.  If you bought vinyl many years ago, and all of a sudden they change the format of the music, 
[01:30:30]  and it is now, it's not modern, the record player.  So they put out new equipment, CD players.  Why should I have to then pay again for the same music that I already bought on vinyl?  So I am just getting the upgrade off of Napster for the music I already had.  These are, like, albums that you've had since the 70s?  This is how you're talking to yourself.  That's how I justify it. 
[01:31:00]  He doesn't want to buy, you know, the Yes album.  I'm also all for food borrowing.  You just walk into someone's house, you open their fridge and start eating, and go,  no, we're just sharing.  I'm file sharing in your refrigerator.  Food sharing.  Oh, man.  So, Brian was telling us a little story about the emergency room during the break.  Yeah.  He was cracking us up.  I had to go myself.  I had, like, this stomach virus thing, and it was 2 o'clock in the morning.  My wife was watching Christopher, so she couldn't take me.  I almost called an ambulance. 
[01:31:30]  And it's weird, like, well, it's weird considering calling an ambulance for yourself.  You know, you always figure you call an ambulance for somebody else.  What do you say about yourself?  Can you come get me?  Yeah, I don't feel so hot.  Could you do the code blue where you don't stop for nobody?  And just come on in.  I'll be sitting on the couch rubbing my belly.  You know, I'm just looking at the phone.  I don't think you're allowed to call an ambulance for yourself.  So I drove myself to the emergency room, which has to be a worse option. 
[01:32:00]  It's 2 o'clock in the morning.  I show up at the entrance, and they don't have any valet parking at the emergency room.  If there's ever a place where they should have a valet parking stand, you know, if there's  ever a time where you're going to go, can you park this because I need to collapse immediately.  But no, I've got to deal with, please take the ticket.  You know, and I'm driving around this lot.  Hey, can I park there?  I think I'm going to die.  I'm dying, too.  Okay, go ahead.  I'll go up a couple levels. 
[01:32:30]  It doesn't matter if you're driving yourself or somebody else.  If you're driving somebody, you still want to hop out with them at the door.  Are you supposed to drop somebody off while you go park?  You know, okay, you go in.  Tell them you're shot.  Ask them if they validate.  You take care of the bullet wounds, and I'll handle parking.  We'll work it out 50-50. 
[01:33:00]  And then, you know, I go in there at 2 o'clock in the morning.  I would think that that would be all they need to know to start doing stuff.  The fact that you show up at a hospital at 2 a.m.  Right.  Must mean, hey, he's here.  Start sticking tubes up his nose.  What else are you showing up for?  Man, I'm bored.  I saw your lights on, and I was wondering, who's up for canasta?  I got a hankering for some canasta like you wouldn't believe. 
[01:33:30]  But I got to, you know, check in with the question they ask.  It kills me.  They throw, they say, what seems to be the problem?  The seems part is so insulting.  What seems to be the problem?  Well, it seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable.  That's what it seems like.  But, you know, I'm no doctor until it gets analyzed officially by one of your medical staff. 
[01:34:00]  In my own delusional world, it seems like there ain't no moisture left inside me.  They put you in a bag in this room, you know.  It's like they do a half room kind of thing with a curtain down the middle with a mystery patient on the other side.  You know, you just see the silhouette over there. 
[01:34:30]  What the hell's the matter with that person?  I'm laying there, and that person over there is moaning, you know.  I'm like, man, they're never going to help me with him moaning like that.  So I got to out-moan him, you know.  He's like, ah, I'm like, ah!  He's cranking it up, ah!  Quit moaning!  We're all hurting!  It's the emergency room!  They know this!  You know, the nurses must just be running around holding their ears. 
[01:35:00]  It's got to be hell to work in this environment!  Then they come in, and the nurse is like, ah, she asks, how you feeling?  I said, you know, terrible, you know, do you have like a painkiller?  She goes, how would you, ah, how would you describe your pain?  What kind of question?  Um, otherworldly?  I don't know.  It's hard for me to find adjectives that can cover this pain. 
[01:35:30]  She goes, well, how would you rate it, then?  How would you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain?  Well, you know, saying 2 ain't going to get you nothing.  Right.  Oh, I'm a 2.  Um, maybe the high 1s.  If you could get me a baby aspirin and cut it in half,  and maybe a Flintstone vitamin, and I'll be out of your hair.  I don't mean to bother y'all with my low-level,  flying-beneath-the-radar-screen pain level. 
[01:36:00]  Uh, I'm 10, I guess, you know.  I was going to say 10, but I backed off,  because I had heard the worst pain a human can endure.  I don't know if this is true, but I heard it was getting your upper leg bone,  your femur bone, cracked in half.  So I thought I better not say 10, because I didn't get my femur bone cracked.  Then I was thinking, what was I worried about?  There's like a femur ward at the hospital.  They'll hear about it and come hobbling into my room.  Who the hell had the audacity to say they were out of level 10? 
[01:36:30]  You know nothing about 10.  Give me a sledgehammer.  Let me show you what 10 is all about, Mr. Tummyache.  Ugh, but I'm fine now.  It ended up I had the sniffles.  Ah, the sniffles.  The sniffles.  What the hell is that?  After all that.  You know what, you got what we call the sniffles.  The sniffles.  You must feel like a moron at that point. 
[01:37:00]  Hey, Anthony.  What?  How do we know he's Brian Regan?  Hmm?  I was just thinking over here.  Someone is on the line saying they're Brian Regan.  Hey, now.  Brian Regan's calling him.  What is happening here?  You sure you're Brian Regan?  I always thought I was.  Pop down Brian Regan.  Uh, Brian Regan?  Hello?  Yeah.  We've got a phony in the studio.  In the studio.  Screwed up a word.  Couldn't get it out correctly.  Trying to do the word, but it wasn't working. 
[01:37:30]  That is me.  Brian's doing a little...  Brian, the real Brian Regan was just in Vegas.  Doing a little gambling.  Putting some money in some machines and getting coins to come out.  The coins coming out, just landing in my pockets.  Trade them in to get some dollars.  I didn't realize how simple my material was.  So, basically, I can just say that I was thirsty and bought some water and then drank it. 
[01:38:00]  It was good.  That's funny.  I would rather throw that in a night, man.  Wait a second.  The real Brian Regan would have done a joke instead of just saying stupid things like I did.  The real Brian Regan would have had a bit.  I just talked and repeated what I said until I made people angry.  The real Brian Regan would have said something funny.  I don't have that kind of material.  I don't know about that, man.  Hey, this is Frank Caliendo. 
[01:38:30]  I would have guessed.  How are you doing, Frank?  I'm doing all my way.  I was going to keep being you.  I blew it.  I blew the whole illusion.  How are you doing, me?  You tore down the wall.  How am I doing?  It's like you're in a play and you talk to the audience.  Hey, what do you think?  We're doing pretty good, huh?  I've got to get back to talking to King Lear.  You've just broken the fourth wall.  All right, Frank.  All right, Rick just gave me a call.  I told me to call in and mess with Brian.  No, no. 
[01:39:00]  Very good job, man.  Hey, Frank, man.  I think you nailed it.  If I can't make a gig, I'm going to call you.  Hey, Frank.  I'll be the short, fat Brian Regan.  Oh, man.  That's very flattering.  Hey, Frank, can I put you on the spot?  Sure.  You've got to do just a tiny bit of Al Pacino for Brian.  Mr. Regan, my name's Al.  How are you doing?  I'm doing good.  Listen, I was wondering how I could get into doing some comedy.  I mean, the other day, I was thinking about back to my childhood, and you might have recalled 
[01:39:30]  the story.  Oh, Al.  We're losing him.  But I'd be brilliant, too.  It's tough when you're driving.  You know what I'm saying?  Is anybody listening?  Yeah, we got you now, man.  Yeah, there you go.  You got a cup of dirt.  That's what I was trying to get to.  Guess what, friends?  It didn't work out.  That would blow my mind to see Al Pacino doing my cup of day.  You got a cup of dirt. 
[01:40:00]  It's a cup of dirt.  It's a cup of dirt.  It's a cup of dirt.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Sorry, it wasn't that funny.  No, it was good.  Your phone was crapping out on us.  Oh, it wasn't?  Yeah.  Good.  Let's blame it on that.  And I look forward to hearing your John Madden one day, too, man.  I hear that's on the line.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Hey, someday that guy, see you in that, and there you go. 
[01:40:30]  Sometimes you got a cell phone.  It works real good.  That means there's a tower nearby.  And if you got a tower nearby, that's a good thing.  And when there's no tower nearby, it's a bad thing.  And good things, as we know, are better than bad things.  Bad things aren't as good as good things.  Sometimes there's a good thing that can be a bad thing for somebody else, and that's  not the best kind of thing for that person.  But at least it's good for you.  And when it's good for you and it's not good for them, there's good and bad. 
[01:41:00]  And good for the people, there's the Garden of Eden.  And, you know, that's the Bible.  You probably read about that there.  He ate what's gave the forbidden fruit there.  Hey, Frank, thank you.  That's fantastic.  All right, I'll leave you guys alone.  Yeah, come see us soon, all right?  All right, we'll talk to you later.  Thanks, man.  Hi, Frank.  Frank Caliendo.  Man.  That's great, man.  Hey, we got to back up a couple jokes. 
[01:41:30]  Jessica's a little bummed.  She thinks the femur broken bone thing should be more than a ten.  Ten's the mostest.  She's looking too into your bit.  Jessica.  This pain goes to 11.  Hi, Jessica.  That femur, you said you'd rate it a ten.  No, much more than that, my friend.  More than a ten.  Much, much more than a ten.  This is like that Spinal Tap episode.  Yeah.  Ten is the most.  Well, why don't you just make it more?  No, it's above the most.  You broke your femur, obviously.  Yeah, I split it in half and popped it out of my leg.  Nice.  Oh.  Okay, so that pain is 11. 
[01:42:00]  11, 11, 11 across the board.  Yeah, I flipped the car.  I'm damn proud of myself.  All right, Jessica.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  That's a big bonus nap.  Yeah, that's the biggest one.  Yeah.  Lexi.  Hey, Lexi.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, oh, my God.  Brian, you are killing me.  Listen, it's daylight and kids are having birthday parties on my street.  And, you know, they sort of wanted some ideas for party games.  And we didn't know what to tell them.  Well, I don't know.  I would think maybe some pin the tail on the donkey. 
[01:42:30]  I think that's a great idea for kids.  Why is it?  Don't you think it's kind of dangerous, though?  Well, no, I think, I don't know what people were thinking when they came up with pin the  tail on the donkey.  All right, we're going to have a whole bunch of kids over.  We're going to blindfold one, give them something sharp, spin them around and let them go.  Go, Bobby, with the pin.  Just run amok.  What are those noises?  Those are puncture wounds, Bobby.  Stop.  We made a horrible error. 
[01:43:00]  Or you could try musical chairs.  There's a nice little anxiety attack for seven-year-olds.  Only one kid can win.  All the other kids are walking around.  There's elbowing other five-year-olds.  How was the party?  It was horrible.  I couldn't get a chair and I got a pin in my neck.  I don't want to go back to that house.  I got a pin in my jugular.  You said that would be a happy house. 
[01:43:30]  You said.  So those are two options.  That was a good setup by Lexi.  Yeah, very good.  Yeah, the softball lob.  The quality setup there, man.  Lexi, we'll see you at the Caroline's tonight.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right, we're going to just let her go.  Usually people set stuff up by saying the absolute last part of the joke, you know.  Do the thing where you say jugular vein at the end. 
[01:44:00]  Erective.  That's a surprise.  Do that.  The big YOLO wants to stop it.  At least tonight when you possibly do that, you won't be shocked when everyone starts screaming  and applauding like the first time.  That was so flattering.  Why the hell are they applauding that much at that one?  I didn't realize at the time that you guys just pumped that up, man.  I certainly appreciate the support, but I was like thrown for a loop because, you know,  usually you do it and hopefully you get a little bit of a laugh. 
[01:44:30]  I did it that night.  People were like yelling, don't make YOLO want to stop it.  I'm like, what the hell is going on here, man?  The call phrase of the retarded.  It really is.  Joke hit this nerve before in front of a crowd.  Yeah, that was strange.  But people are applauding and clapping.  They had their lighters out like you started a creeper.  Hey, I got a set up for you.  Yeah?  Brian, I recently learned, heard.  He's like reading it.  I recently learned. 
[01:45:00]  Do your joke about.  I recently heard that you learned to play chess.  You did.  Nice set up.  It's so subtle.  Thank you.  I actually had a talent for that.  I had a radio guy, and I may have told you this before.  I went in there, and I had written down some topics.  I said, you know, you can get into them if you want.  If not, that's fine.  He goes, Brian, you wrote down here for me to ask you about dogs.  Why, do you have some good dog jokes? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, do I?  Do I ever?  I'm known for my funny dog jokes.  Funny dog joke number one.  Now just sit back and be entertained by my dog jokes.  I enjoy my dog jokes.  But, you know, it's funny you mention this thing about chess, Opie, because.  I just had a hunch, you know.  I have been playing chess.  You know, the thing that's weird about it, it doesn't end. 
[01:46:00]  It doesn't end right.  It doesn't end like there's no finality to it.  You know, you're just looking at the board, and your opponent goes, checkmate.  And you're like, my king is still there.  And he's like, yeah, but no matter what you do in the next move, I take the king and the following move.  So it's a checkmate.  You know, he's in the car heading home.  No other game lets you do that.  You know, you never see a quarterback coming up to the line, touchdown!  The way your safeties are playing, we'll do a slam pass underneath the coverage.  Too much of a cushion.  Six points.  Touchdown.  Hey, why don't you score the touchdown, man? 
[01:46:30]  And then you get warned, which is, you don't see that in anything else either.  In chess, before you ever get checkmated, you know, your opponent just goes, check, check.  I'm sorry, what?  What did you say?  You're in check.  You're in trouble.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  I wasn't aware, but now I am.  You don't see that in foot.  You don't see the linebackers, you know, just talking to the quarterback.  Hey, we're blitzing.  What?  He's doing a safety blitz from back in there. 
[01:47:00]  I'm sneaking in right here between the center and the guard.  Oh, okay.  Hey, block him.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Linebacker.  I had no idea.  One of the only jokes where I whisper.  I go from screaming jugular to whispering linebacker.  I'm going to pin in my jugular.  Thank you, Mr. Linebacker. 
[01:47:30]  Sound man's going, would you just pick on a volume level ho-ho?  Because I'm back here scrambling.  You're all over the place.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Wow.  Wow.  But, girls, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Who can improve on that?  And who would want to?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock. 
[01:48:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is Rich Voss.  You might recognize me if you were on the train today.  You are listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  He's dancing.  Yes, I am.  I'm good.  Let me dance, too.  He's dancing.  Opie, I don't think I'm going to dance.  Opie dances like the father in fame when he parks the cab with two arms going up.  That's my son! 
[01:48:30]  Playing Bruno Montelli.  Easy.  Opie's actually danced in public.  What are you talking about?  You've danced at, like, clubs.  What are you talking about?  When you go out, you have a little too many, maybe.  I don't dance in clubs.  Even as a joke.  Do you hear what you're saying?  Even as a joke.  I don't even go to clubs.  But you've done it.  Not a dance club.  A bar, let's say.  A song will come on, and you'll start doing your little dance.  Opie's a raver.  Well, that's a lot different than going, I go to clubs and dance, you ass.  Is it a club? 
[01:49:00]  Now the photoshops are going to start going nuts.  They're going to have me as freaking John Travolta.  Go to opianthony.com to get to all our fan sites, by the way.  You didn't even call me, Opie.  No, I'll do a little bounce thing from the side.  Right.  At a regular bar, you ass.  That's what I'm talking about.  You're dancing in a club.  You just got to go to clubs and dance.  It's a club, but you're dancing a little.  That's all I'm saying.  That's what you do.  You do that little back thing.  The little backwards thing.  You actually do move.  No, I raise my hands in the air.  Like, I just don't care. 
[01:49:30]  You do, like, a move, though.  It's not different every time.  So you have a dance, and it's at a club.  I do a little bounce.  A little bounce.  It's a little bounce, but it's not at a club.  No, there's hands are involved.  If you just did a bounce, that's one thing.  But hands are involved.  Kenny's seen it.  Kenny knows.  Kenny, can you do it?  Are you crazy?  You guys are crazy.  I am not crazy.  Watch Jimmy.  Jimmy's got it down.  Jimmy's got it.  There it is.  I don't do that.  That's the dance.  That's what we call the Opie dance.  I don't do that, you hooker-loving ass. 
[01:50:00]  It's almost a Davy Jones skate with something else thrown in I can't quite figure out.  Ben.  Ben.  With a little bit of Ben Sparks twitch.  You guys have lost your mind.  Do the Ben.  I do a little bounce.  Do the Ben.  I do a little bounce because I'm feeling the rhythm.  Next thing you know, I'm dancing in clubs.  Are you insane?  I meant out in public.  I meant out in public at a bar. 
[01:50:30]  When a song comes on the jukebox, you'll do that move.  For 10 seconds.  It's long enough.  Maybe.  What I was getting to is the point that I don't dance.  Not at weddings.  Not at anything.  And the fact that, you know, you should be proud that you're that open.  I don't dance!  You do.  How come everyone can do it then?  I don't know.  Ben.  Ben's doing it.  You guys had a secret meeting before I got here.  It's obvious.  No, we didn't.  Time to throw Opie under the bus.  No.  Again. 
[01:51:00]  You dance.  It's all right.  There's a little dancing.  Secret meetings going on.  I'm convinced of it.  Secret room.  No, it came up.  Secret room with secret meetings before I get here.  It was the natural course of conversation.  If you listen to the replay, you'll see how it got there.  I don't know how.  I'm going to get here.  Why would I be dancing at clubs?  My pockets are full of money.  I don't want to risk the money falling out.  Now you've angered our producer.  And then I have to awkwardly pick it up in front of everybody. 
[01:51:30]  It's funny.  You talked about Ben.  I can't say what it is.  Let's just say we did voiceover things for something yesterday.  I can't really say what it is.  You'll eventually know.  Yeah.  But they said, you know, I did some.  Ope did some.  Ant's going to do some.  And Ben did some.  And Laszlo was telling me that it was really funny because Ben was.  That's good.  It doesn't matter.  No, it doesn't matter.  But Ben was on a mic.  And he said the guy had to go, dude, you got to stop shaking off the mic.  Because Ben kept doing his lines like all over the place.  Oh, he wasn't maintaining like three inches from the mic. 
[01:52:00]  He's like three feet away, right against it, two feet away.  Some sound engineer's got to screw with that.  Sounds like an atomic weapon going off in the Grand Canyon.  Anyway.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  Make sure you get the wows on your cars.  Especially to the new listeners.  This thing.  Tell them, Anthony.  Well, before I explain, I want to pop up all the ladies on Pal Talk.  Because when you start talking about Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, they whip them out. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  On Pal Talk for us.  Yeah, we got so many things going on with this.  Oh, there's video.  We got the Pal Talk.  People are checking out video of us right now in studio doing this radio show.  Yeah, we got hundreds of people in these rooms.  And they can check out video of us in the studio just hanging out.  And on Wednesdays.  You can hear some of the stuff we're talking about during breaks.  Yeah, and on Wednesdays, they love to flash us.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, every Wednesday.  You put a wow on your vehicle.  Any way, shape, or form, you can get the officially sanctioned wow bumper sticker.  Which, how do you get that?  You got to send a self-addressed stamped envelope. 
[01:53:00]  Hold on.  I'm not even listening to you right now.  What happened?  This dancing thing is taking off because you asked.  Okay.  Swipes.  Okay.  I'll explain.  You don't have to.  It's cool.  The clubs.  Maybe I made it sound like you were going down to the disco.  Cigars and scotch.  Cigars and scotch.  Ellen's got nothing on Opie.  Oh, no.  What did I do to you, cigars and scotch?  Does that make them dancing on in the beginning of the show?  I've done nothing but support you, my friend.  And you throw them under a bus. 
[01:53:30]  Billy and Jersey, what's up?  Didn't I see you doing the electric slide at F.H. Riley's?  See you later, Bert.  Can I be here?  Of course, I will take advantage of that.  F.H. Riley's is the fine restaurant I own with my brothers in Huntington.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  And no, I do not do the electric slide at that fine establishment.  I'm going to that establishment with the boys on Friday.  On Friday, perhaps after a couple of glasses of wine or something, maybe you get to see Opie do his moves. 
[01:54:00]  Just karaoke, right?  Now everyone's going to be looking at me to see if I, like, do a little, you know, little thing.  I've seen you do it at F.H. Riley's.  I've seen you leaning against the wall.  Doing the little back.  It's like the shoulders kind of roll back.  You know, it's kind of like a little relaxed shoulder roll.  Yeah, this was, I think this was one of the songs.  It's the only time I feel like someone when I'm dancing, dancing down at the disco. 
[01:54:30]  Opie gets in the car with a double J.  Annette, cigarette.  What the F?  I've just seen you do the moves, even at F.H. Riley's.  You were leaning against the wall one day.  And a song came on.  And you just, like, you put on the face and you got the arms going.  And I'm like, yeah, Opie's feeling it. 
[01:55:00]  He's feeling the groove.  I do a little bounce.  But there are arms.  Bounce is like you're making it sound like you're river dancing.  Ben just actually handed me a funny note.  No way.  Opie goes raving at the crowbar with glow sticks.  Well, Bert and Phillies, the Opie dance is your chance.  Do the Opie.  Do the Opie.  The Opie.  Do the Opie.  Opie. 
[01:55:30]  We've just all seen it.  That's all.  Yeah, great.  Great, great.  Hey, Max, give me a bitch.  Trust me.  I'm not saying anything that just we all haven't seen.  It's the move.  We all have our own little things.  Nothing.  Everyone gets a little chuckle out of it.  It's funny.  We know you're not seriously, you know, dancing.  I could be on the next episode of So You Think You Can Dance.  This is inside probably, but we don't feel like explaining everything on this show. 
[01:56:00]  Bert and Philly, this weekend at FH Riley's.  No filter, Paul.  To Opie.  Why don't you call me, Opie?  Call me.  I hope it ends the same way, with him plummeting from a bridge.  That stupid Lego person wig flying off his head.  Big platform shoes, walking down the sidewalk crying.  That's what I want to see.  No filter, Paul, dressed in white 70s clothing with platform shoes.  Big platform shoes and gold chains.  White platform shoes. 
[01:56:30]  Perhaps it in Elvis' cape.  Let's say hi to Chris in West Point.  Chris.  Yeah, he was looking like Buffalo Bill dancing.  This is a nice James Gumb scene.  James Gumb?  What did you say?  Did I say James?  James, of course I did.  James.  Yeah, yeah, James.  James Gumb.  But there is a fine little dance sequence in the new Clerks 2 movie that made me laugh out loud. 
[01:57:00]  Would you?  Let's go to Dan in Boston.  Dan, what's up?  Sorry.  I got to do the thing.  She's a great big fat person.  Mrs. Littman.  Mrs. Littman.  I think I got a card inside.  You want to go inside?  Jack Gordon.  You need help with that?  Would you?  Thank you.  Greatest character ever.  Oh, what a doll he was.  Dan, hold on one second.  Tony from a lake in New Jersey I cannot pronounce. 
[01:57:30]  Want Conkoma?  No, no, wait.  Lake...  Hoppa-Pakon.  Lake-O-Pakon.  Lake-O-Pakon.  Lake-O-Pakon.  I don't know.  It starts with an H.  H-O-P-A-T-C-O-N-G.  Hoppa-Pakon.  Hoppa-Pakon.  Lake-O-Pakon.  Stinks.  Another Indian name.  Exactly.  The Indians got screwed.  We took their land.  I did that.  And then just named things after them.  It's Lake, ten bucks, now beat it.  Right.  Take these anthrax blankets with you. 
[01:58:00]  Exactly.  Keep you warm.  Lake, here's a bead.  Tell your story walking, fella.  Tony's on to something.  I hope he can't dance because his wallet keeps him off balance.  That's all you're seeing.  That's all you're really seeing there is me just trying to keep everything balanced.  What I should do is start carrying two wallets in my back pocket.  Right.  Dan in Boston, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I got an old WAF Real Rock TV tape in it.  Opie and Anthony at a WAF event, and Opie's dancing in the background to one of the songs. 
[01:58:30]  He looks like a total jackass.  Wow.  Classic.  You don't have that.  Yeah.  You had Billy Idol in the studio.  Right.  And then you guys were at the Bayside Expo Center, and Opie was doing a skateboard thing, but  it wasn't really him skateboarding.  Oh, I remember that bit.  That was funny.  It was me.  It was you.  It was Opie right at the lip of a half pipe.  Shut up.  It was me the whole time.  And he'd jump off, and then he switched clothes with this kid who was really good. 
[01:59:00]  And he's got a hood pulled up over his head, and he's doing some great moves on this half  pipe.  And then he comes flying up, and of course, it cuts back to Opie going, ha, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but when it cuts back to me, I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the half pipe.  Yeah.  You know?  And I fell on my ass and pretty much messed up my back pretty bad.  I couldn't even do that part of the bit.  There was no real skateboarding in that without dying. 
[01:59:30]  I want a copy of that video.  He gave it away.  Oh, there's a whole series.  My shoes changed?  Yeah, when it panned to the guy going down the half pipe, it was a different colored  shoe.  Continuity error.  Yeah.  All right, boys.  You rock.  All right, Dan.  Send that tape in if you have it.  We'll throw it up on the website.  What the hell?  I'd love to see some of that old Real Rock TV stuff.  I got all of them.  I got all of them.  Do you?  I got every episode.  Are you kidding?  I save everything.  Dang.  Okay.  One day, you're going to have to let me borrow them so I can put them on DVD. 
[02:00:00]  Invite me to your house and I'll bring them over.  You're cordially invited.  This?  Sunday.  Sunday?  I got plans.  Saturday?  I got plans.  Tony, you don't call me.  I don't know.  I'll call you.  They're on VHS.  Yes, I got to switch them over before they run out.  They rot.  They're going to run out of VHS machines soon.  Mm-hmm.  I got dats.  I got this.  I got dats. 
[02:00:30]  Oh.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Geraldo Rivera and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I like the Bush thing.  You like the Bush thing?  That was a big story.  Over the weekend?  Over the weekend.  All right.  This is just...  Oh, I don't want to poke fun, though.  Aw.  It's mean-spirited.  Oh, no.  I'm starting to think...  Why?  The older generation just doesn't know what's going on with the Internet.  Well, who brought that up?  Did Dan bring it up?  Who brought it up?  You did?  The separation of the generations? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It has something to do with the Internet.  I just assume that old people know what the Internet's all about.  No, they don't.  There is definitely the dividing line between the older generation and the newer generation  is computers.  Of course, older generation, not a clue.  They might use them.  They might use them for stuff, the email, things like that, but they really don't know  how they work, what they do.  They use one billionth of a percent of its capacity. 
[02:01:30]  And then there are older people that just, like my mother, not a clue.  And we've tried a hundred times to buy her stuff, buy her the easiest computer thing.  Remember Web TV?  Even tried that.  Look, it's on your goddamn TV just so we could send you an email or a picture or something.  I don't know.  Ooh, I don't know.  They're afraid.  They're afraid.  They're afraid.  It's overwhelming when you look at the technology.  Because when I was in high school in 86, they were just starting to do like DOS prompt and 
[02:02:00]  all that crap and teach you like that computer lingo.  I don't write into that.  It was like I needed to know how this worked and everything.  But you had a young brain.  Right.  You could soak all that in.  In the old days.  My mother would rather, I tell her all the time, internet movie database, because my mother's  like a movie nut, loves movies.  I go, you just punch in any actor movie you could cross-reference, find out when it was  made by who, this, that.  She goes, no, I have my Leonard Maltin book. 
[02:02:30]  Every year.  She gets this book.  It's two feet tall.  My mom gets that book, too.  It's huge.  And she thumbs through it and goes, what an actor movie.  It takes her a week to find like what she's looking for.  I have my Leonard Maltin book.  Well, that's terrific.  In two seconds, you could have the answer to what you want.  Leonard Maltin is a creep.  What an ass.  No one likes him.  His big, thick, stupid book.  Exactly.  I'm going to knock her unconscious with that thing one day.  Get a computer, mom.  It's great to get a confession in a South Carolina police station with her.  Right. 
[02:03:00]  Beat your wife around the body with it so the bruises don't show.  The old head and nose bombs straighten her out her.  That's what we also call the Leonard Maltin book.  I'm Leonard Maltin.  I'm Leonard Maltin and I approve this book.  Another repugnant name.  Well, Bush, this is some scary stuff.  You really think the president would know a little bit more about the Internet.  Now, the president, being an older guy, should be taught this.  Someone should sit him down and smack him in the face and say, look, this is technology of the day. 
[02:03:30]  You need to know this to run this country.  Right.  You need to have a working knowledge of computers and the Internet in order to really represent the people of this country.  Apparently, he doesn't.  He can handle a power saw.  But when it comes to the power of the Internet, I hear there's rumors on the Internet's not once, but at least twice.  Wait a minute, dude.  I got to say, I think I think he was being silly there. 
[02:04:00]  No, he wasn't.  No, I don't think so.  Then listen to him be silly two or three times.  But the Internet's.  No, why?  The Internet's.  Because he paused like, uh-oh, how do you say this word?  The Internet's.  He's thinking, because he has no concept between the Internet and websites.  So he's thinking the Internets are different sites that you go to.  You know, hey, I'm looking at a few websites here to try to find the answer.  He's thinking the Internets are, each website is an Internet. 
[02:04:30]  And he doesn't really know how to joke.  He doesn't know.  Even when he is joking, it's just so awkward.  But he said it a few times, too.  Internet.  Oh, sorry.  It'd be almost like if he paused and said, uh, nuclear.  Or nuclear, whatever the word is.  Nuclear, because he can't say that right.  Nuclear, like, like, well, I thought it sounded like he was doing a ton in cheek, but maybe I'm wrong.  No, he really doesn't have a clue.  He can handle a power saw, but when it comes to the power of the Internet.  I hear there's rumors on the Internets. 
[02:05:00]  Not once, but at least twice, President Bush has inexplicably added an S.  We can have filters on Internets.  Leading young whippersnappers to mock him.  Everyone's on the Internets.  Yeah.  That's our fearless leader.  Now the leader dubbed Googler-in-chief by the Wall Street Journal has struck again.  During a CNBC interview, the president was asked if he ever Googled.  Occasionally.  And one of the things I've used on the Google is to pull up maps. 
[02:05:30]  On the Google.  I pull up the maps on the Google.  On the Google.  Here's a guy.  He's the president of the United States.  He has Pentagon satellites at his disposal for maps.  And anything he wants, I pull it up on the Google.  On the Google.  On the Internet.  Search on the Internet.  A search engine known as the Google.  The Google.  The Google.  When I do the Google.  Sounds like a new dance.  When I'm doing the Google, it's a lot different than the Yahoo. 
[02:06:00]  I'm doing the Google and the Google.  The Google.  And he's looking at dumb maps.  Yeah.  Because he was like, what do you use?  And you could tell he had to think on his feet there.  It's like, maps.  They got that, don't they?  Maps are exciting to look at for about 30 seconds.  Where are you driving to that you need to Google a map?  He doesn't have to.  I think he said he likes looking at pictures of his ranch.  Ew.  So it's like, it's where I want to be.  So it goes to Google Earth. 
[02:06:30]  And then I Google and I say, I think I can see me.  I can see my house from here.  Who else does that?  Muhammad Atta was doing that.  Quite a few other people were Googling your ranch.  They were Googling quite a few places around the country.  Right.  Your ranch in particular.  They'd love to get a hold of that for an aerial view.  The Google.  Sir, they're using the Google.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I like to go to the, what's that one called?  The Cinema Skin.  I like to go to that one. 
[02:07:00]  The, I like to go to the Nude Teens.  I use that one every so often for maps.  Maps.  Maps of Hawaii.  Maps of a young, supple body.  I go to the Google, I take off the preference filter.  Because if you have to filter on the images,  you're not going to get all the real dirty, dirty pictures.  Make sure you, when you're on the Google, go to the preferences and then click off the filters and go to images and put in nude women.  Go ahead, do it right now. 
[02:07:30]  I dare you on the Google.  You'll be Googling when, go to the tub girl.  I love the tub girl.  Just Google my last name.  Just Google my last name and see how many you got to go through before you get to me when you take off your filters.  Go ahead.  Yes.  You're going to see the bush.  How about the horse gag?  Go, go, go to the horse gag, the bang bus.  You could go.  I mean, I went to Bush on there. 
[02:08:00]  I took the preference off.  I was pwned.  I was pwned.  I was the pwned.  I know everything about it.  I was playing Counter-Strike and I was the pwned.  A little more audio.  It's a little bit the way my mom talks about technology.  It's sort of sweet.  It's kind of endearing.  She calls to tell you that she got an email.  President Bush said he uses the Google to look at satellite maps of his ranch in Crawford, Texas.  Reminds me of where I want to be sometimes. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, my God.  What a liar.  You think he just looks at maps of Iraq and makes sound effects?  He's like, look, I'm winning.  I don't see any insurgents down there.  Look, I'm zooming in.  I don't see one insurgent on the Google.  The Google, indeed.  Google your dumb ranch on a laptop when you can just go and say, look, I would like an aerial photograph taken from space.  Why would you Google a map?  Exactly.  He's got spy planes, satellites, the Pentagon. 
[02:09:00]  He could look at anything.  Hey, I need a picture of my ranch.  Could you get me one at a resolution that's a little better than the Google?  But he's – you know why?  Because he's lying.  It was – she was being a skank, too, by trying to trip him up.  She obviously sensed as a newswoman that he wasn't computer savvy and decided to go in for the kill and ask him a question.  Do you use Google?  Instead of him going, no, I really don't.  I've – you know, I got people.  I'm a little busy to be cruising the internets. 
[02:09:30]  Well, how about, no, why would I Google when I've had access to all the information that you need to go onto the web for?  I have access to that information.  I have it from the people.  I actually looked on Gary Glitter's computer itself to read transcripts.  All the stuff you're reading on the internets, we made up anyway.  It's a big, grand conspiracy.  You know, that was a cruise missile.  He hit the Pentagon.  Why not go to the Google?  The Google. 
[02:10:00]  Wait, I'm doing the Google.  I love it.  Isn't that great?  But that's it.  He's just – he's not with it.  He really isn't.  I'm sorry.  And to be a leader in this country, in this day and age, you've really got to be computer savvy.  You know, it's really where a lot of people's ideas are being placed for you to look at.  Maybe he doesn't want to see it.  Maybe he's, you know.  Oh, I hate that damn Wackbush. 
[02:10:30]  It's Wackbush message board.  Yeah, you think it's on message boards?  It's called Wackbush.  What the hell is that?  Look, they're bashing me.  I'm going to sign up.  I've got one post.  You think it's easy running the country?  Angry typing, Prez.  That's me.  I've been doing the blogging.  I'm blogging.  I'm on the MySpace.  And the YouTube.  Just the image of him, like, fighting, like, message board wars.  Listen, you ass.  And I realize they can look at his IP address and figure out it's him. 
[02:11:00]  It just says the White House.  He's got two different names.  You think she's being slick.  One is Prez1.  And one is GB2nd.  Just defending Bush, but, like, not as himself.  He's doing a great job.  Just because he says the Google doesn't mean he doesn't use the Google.  Mock him all you want.  Mock me all you want.  Edit, edit, post.  Oh, damn it.  Edit, edit. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, my time ran out.  I can't edit my post no more.  Now it looks like me.  That guy above was, this is me, the president.  Guy above me was not me.  But I won't be posting no more.  And that one pal talk photo of him just panning down his chest into his lap,  waving it at the camera because he doesn't know about screen capping.  Want to go the private?  I'll go the private with you.  All right, listen, before we take a break, because we've got to get the...  We've got to take the break. 
[02:12:00]  Well, it's the only virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  Did you see that movie, Gracious, set of ta-ta?  Wow.  Whip them out one day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  Thank you. </pre>
