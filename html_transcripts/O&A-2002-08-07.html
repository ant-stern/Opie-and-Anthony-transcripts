<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Opie's pumpkin-picking trip with his girlfriend, Sandy, which devolved into a lengthy, vulgar comedic bit about their arduous journey to find a farm with a red wagon.  Numerous listener calls followed, filled with ribald jokes and insults related to the story. Sandy later called in herself, adding details and mentioning photos she'd taken. The conversation abruptly shifted to EverQuest, spurred by a news story about a player's suicide.  Callers shared their own extreme gaming experiences, highlighting the game's addictive nature.  A staged phone call to a mother whose son was supposedly jailed for drug possession, featuring exaggerated police scenarios, was followed by promotion of a "Vote for Boobs" contest.

The show then transitioned into a segment dominated by caller anecdotes about bachelorette parties and strip clubs, exploring the perceived double standard in men's and women's behavior in these settings. A dentist caller recounted his lucrative experiences working at bachelor parties, highlighting the often-unsanitary situations. Callers shared stories of girlfriends kissing strippers and bringing home explicit photos;  several described women using scissors to damage performers' clothing, even attempting genital mutilation.  Other calls detailed a marriage ruined by a stain revealed under blacklight and infidelity discovered through developed photographs from an engagement party.

Comedian Brian Regan joined the show as a guest.  The hosts and callers discussed his career, with Regan sharing anecdotes about his work, ER visits, and children's books. The conversation touched upon politically incorrect terminology regarding people with dwarfism.  A humorous phone prank involving a fake European vacation win was followed by a caller impersonating Frank Caliendo impersonating Brian Regan.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the Who's continued North American tour despite the death of their bassist, John Entwistle.

The broadcast continued with a chaotic segment.  Comedian "Dice" performed a rambling, expletive-laden musical intro with sexually explicit lyrics.  A caller complained about green poop after eating takeout from the hosts' restaurant, prompting jokes from the hosts.  In-studio guests Rich Voss and Patrice O'Neal were present; a lengthy, insult-laden exchange occurred between the hosts and Voss, filled with jokes about his age, material, car, and perceived attempts to curry favor. Racial humor and stereotypes were also present. A female caller, Elisa, sought advice on her boyfriend's reluctance to have sex during her menstruation, receiving crude and insensitive responses. Opie and Anthony shared lengthy, self-deprecating stories about their impoverished childhoods. The show ended with a song parodying the Special Olympics theme, with lyrics about a mentally challenged childhood friend, interspersed with commercial breaks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  No one has ever done anything like this.  I know you're out there.  I can feel you now.  I know that you're afraid.  You're afraid of us.  You're afraid of change.  Why not what you think?  I'm going to hang up this phone,  and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.  A world where anything is possible.  This is the only end of this show. 
[00:00:30]  At my signal.  Unleash hell.  Welcome to the bottomless pit of Ignorance.  Here's a clip.  Jesus Christ, this is going to suck.  Is it mango or papaya?  Now I'm getting ratings up.  How are we supposed to win in the ratings?  If we can't talk about boo and our pleasure.  Fuck it up. Walk it off, Dick.  I love Camel Toe.  Shaving for America.  No ass. 
[00:01:00]  I gotta see that ass.  No.  No.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  No ass.  Hope he says, it isn't bad.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[00:01:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Number three.  You popped up your chest, sir.  You're all burning in hell, damn you.  Alcohol equals great radio.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you not entertained?  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea. 
[00:02:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  I wish I could have heard the rest of the day happening on Saturday.  Well, listen, it wasn't my idea.  Going to extra innings, and that's right about the time that we pulled up to the pumpkin farm. 
[00:03:00]  Did you do it again this year, dude?  Look, I understand that I am opening up a can of worms here.  I'm not stupid, but we're pretty honest on this show.  Oh, yeah.  I drove out east on the island to get the pumpkins, Anthony.  You did a little pumpkin patch.  Oh, yeah.  With Sandy.  Oh, did you have a little wagon? 
[00:03:30]  See, a lot of the cars going out to...  Wait a minute.  A lot of the cars that you see on the LIE going out east, they have their own little pumpkin wagons  that they tie to the top of their SUVs or station wagons.  And you could pull your own little pumpkin wagon through the pumpkin patch as you pick your own pumpkins.  So that's what you were doing this weekend, huh?  Yeah.  I will never understand women.  Ever.  So I agreed to do the pumpkin... 
[00:04:00]  Again.  ...picking again.  Right.  Shut up!  Dick.  Don't laugh too hard.  The shock feature in that wedding ring is quite funny there, Rick.  When she hits the button at home and it's like a stun gun.  All right, listen.  I don't understand...  I just don't understand you women.  All right.  So I agreed to go pumpkin picking, okay?  And if you know anything about the island, I'm sure it's like this for Jersey and Pennsylvania  and Westchester, whatever.  You have to drive out to the wilderness a little bit. 
[00:04:30]  It's part of the experience, I guess, right?  Part of it.  Okay.  So we're on the North Fork of Long Island.  And then, you know, farm stand after farm stand, farm field after farm field is nothing  but pumpkins.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  So I drive about, I would say, a good hour from my house, Anthony.  Sure.  Wouldn't you think that's far enough into the wilderness?  Of course, when you're going east on Long Island.  Oh, no.  It wasn't far enough.  It's all farms out.  I'm like, they're picking pumpkins right here. 
[00:05:00]  Because I'm thinking I could get home and watch the end of the Met game.  I have it on on FAG or whatever station carries the Mets.  That's right.  Game's real interesting.  And I'm like, okay, look, if I figure this out perfectly, we can get the pumpkin picking  out of the way.  I can drink some stupid cider, run through a damn corn maze, and I'm home on the couch.  I have the corn maze.  I did not do the corn maze this year.  The corn maze.  I forgot last year you had to go through the corn maze.  Oh, boy.  Just like the shining, isn't it? 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Just like the hedge maze.  So this was my...  I could see through the corn.  This is my problem.  So now it wasn't good enough.  Oh, no.  Let's keep going further out.  Mm-hmm.  Further into the wilderness.  Further.  Further.  Keep going.  Going.  I'm an hour and a half from home.  It wasn't good enough.  You got to keep going?  Going and going.  I'm like, what's wrong with that field?  Look.  Look.  On this one, we could drive on a dirt road and really feel like we're in the middle of  nowhere and pick our pumpkins.  Oh, you could have gone a little off-roading.  Off-roading.  Okay.  Wasn't good enough. 
[00:06:00]  Know why?  Why?  She wanted the little red wagon.  Oh, you needed a wagon?  They didn't have wagons.  No, I guess only one farm has the little red wagon, Anthony.  Which is about two hours from home, Anthony.  I was pretty much in Greenport at this.  Almost.  Did you take a hayride?  You know.  Did you take a hayride, O.F.A.?  I will punch this down and let Gary abuse me.  Gary, go ahead.  Yeah, what a wimp this guy is.  He's gone out there to get pumpkins. 
[00:06:30]  Come on.  He ain't got kids.  Give me a break.  He's blue.  Anthony, you're great.  See?  I did that to myself.  I saw it on the screen.  That's okay.  Anthony took the abuse yesterday about the soap operas.  Joe, what's going on?  Oh, you're a homo.  I have a question.  Did you go mountain bike running with the seat off when you were done today?  All right.  Come on.  Did you put a horn on a pumpkin and bang it?  You're a homo. 
[00:07:00]  You should go work for F.A.G.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  So you pulled the little wagon, O.F.E.?  Through the pumpkin field with the other pumpkin people?  I will not confirm or deny that fact, Anthony.  I'm sure you pulled the wagon.  For the love of God, I hope there's not a picture.  Oh.  So you pulled the wagon.  For the love of God, I hope there's not a picture.  Did you pick your pumpkins?  Pick your...  No one was left just, you know, pumpkins that had footprints in them and kick marks from 
[00:07:30]  all the other pissed off guys.  Ravaged pumpkins.  Ravaged pumpkins.  So this is my hell.  So I'm timing the Met game.  Okay.  Because now I'm like, all right, I got to keep driving because this game is getting really  interesting.  Yeah.  All right.  So I didn't mind that we were now about two hours from home.  Mm-hmm.  Start losing the signal for F.A.G.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Then it goes into extra innings as I'm losing the signal as we pull up to the pumpkin farm  with the little red wagons, Anthony.  Little red wagon. 
[00:08:00]  So to make a long story short, when I finally got back in the car after our little fun in  the pumpkin field...  Yeah.  Ugh.  How many pumpkins did you get, Opie?  I'm really concerned.  Oh, three, Anthony.  Three pumpkins.  Could have got that in Huntington, where I live.  Yeah, you know, they're selling pumpkins right down there in downtown Huntington.  Pretty much.  And you can pick up the cool stencils to cut the jack-o-lantern.  Are you going to make a jack-o-lantern, Opie?  You know, all right, I'll let you guys have some fun.  Fine. 
[00:08:30]  Here we go.  Here comes the abuse.  Lou.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Did you put two small pumpkins in the front of your pants where your balls used to be?  Hey.  Come on, you can relate to me, right, Lou?  Nah, not really.  I don't think too many people can at this point.  No.  Oh, yeah.  I'm the only guy that gets dragged pumpkin picking.  Yeah, well...  Please.  Johnny.  Hey.  Hey.  You got two months.  You'll be out cutting Christmas trees down there.  No, no, no.  I've never done that, and I never will. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, you say that now.  Let's drive 200 miles upstate to cut down a Christmas tree.  No, no, no.  Loading up the sleigh.  No, I've never done that one.  Not yet.  Homo and Anthony.  Thank you, Johnny.  Homo and Anthony.  This guy.  Uh, Rick.  Homo and A?  Homo and A.  What's the deal, dude?  Come on.  You've never gone pumpkin picking.  Yeah, but I wouldn't even get it on here.  And I didn't know the Mets game...  I didn't know the Mets game...  Well, that's what this show's about, we're a little honest, and we...  I mean, you're whooped.  You're pumpkin whooped.  You want some pumpkin pie or something like that.  Come on.  And I didn't know the Mets game was going to go into extra innings like that. 
[00:09:30]  It killed me.  I mean, I thought you were a Mets fan.  I am.  Yeah, really.  Mets fan.  That's the problem.  Well, I watched.  I watched.  I listened for the whole game all the way out.  They tied it up, and the only reason why I didn't continue to listen to the game in  the car, we truly lost the signal at this point.  It was going in and out when your favorite radio station goes in and out.  Oh.  And you're in a little Mets game, and next thing you know, you're hearing Bette Miller  like, oh, oh, oh.  Bob Murphy back on the thing.  Oh.  Wings beneath my wing.  You know.  Wind beneath my wings.  Whatever. 
[00:10:00]  Thank you, Rick.  All right, dude.  Don't you hate that, though?  You're convincing you got a few more miles out of your radio station?  Ah, it just dies, yeah.  Ah, John, what's going on?  How you doing, man?  Hey.  Listen, I had to do it, too.  The only difference is I'm not a homo like you.  I didn't have to do it until I had kids.  Oh, man.  I'm telling you.  At least me and my friend have to do it.  We're sitting there crying on each other's shoulders, but we got kids.  We look at geeks like you, and we go, oh, man, wait till this idiot gets married.  Oh, man.  I'm telling you.  What a wuss. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, my God.  Listen, you guys are great.  Keep it up, man.  Thank you.  God, this is painful.  I hate this.  Frank, go ahead.  You are some homo, I'll tell you.  Listen, I'm only going to give you guys five more minutes, and I'm getting out of this  subject.  I'm telling you, man, that's terrible.  Like I said, it's so easy to be a fag on this show.  It changes every day.  Hey, Ron, what's up?  I got to tell you something, man.  Yeah.  A fag doesn't begin to describe it.  You guys ragging on Rick all the time.  You're not even close to married yet.  True.  And this is what you're going down with? 
[00:11:00]  True.  Why don't you go to the places in Dix Hills with the little red wagons?  Wasn't far enough.  Wasn't far enough.  You've got to be out in the wilderness.  Yeah.  This could get ugly, but my girlfriend's on the line.  Look who's calling.  Thank you, Ron.  Hi, Sandy.  Sandy.  Hi.  Hey, Sandy.  Hi.  You've been listening?  Yes, I have.  Did you hear about the pumpkin picking?  Yes, I did.  Did you have fun with Opie pulling the wagon?  Yes.  We had a wonderful time.  Did he pull the wagon? 
[00:11:30]  Yes, we both pulled the wagon.  You both?  Did he fail to mention the fact that there's pictures of him pulling the wagon with pumpkins  in it?  There's also a picture of him.  They had this huge pumpkin cutout that you stand behind it and put your face through it.  I guess you forgot to mention that there's a picture of him doing that, too.  Wait a minute.  He's sticking his head to a big pumpkin cutout.  Wasn't my idea.  That was, too.  Oh, Steve's got to get the website back on. 
[00:12:00]  We've got to get those pictures on.  What else?  What about when you were, like, knee-deep in the pumpkin vines trying to find some gourds?  Gourds?  All those little gourds, like the yellow and orange little...  To do what?  She wants to put them in a basket, Anthony.  I'm putting them in a basket.  He didn't mention that?  And he was the one...  Wait, no, no, no, no.  He was the one who had to buy the apple cider.  Well, yeah.  I got some apple cider.  I was thirsty after, you know, was it taking away the pumpkins? 
[00:12:30]  You know, I forced you to even get apple cider.  Did you get your Dickens cider?  From Dickens Apple Farm.  Yeah, where's Dickens cider?  Oh, my goodness.  Well, it sounds like you had a lot of fun.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  And wait, wait.  Oh, Sam.  I remember.  Enough.  Yeah?  Enough.  Didn't you last year, didn't your wife buy the cutouts and you did the pumpkins for her?  Well, that's true, yeah.  Huh?  Huh?  I did.  There was a stencil.  There was a stencil and you did the pumpkin?  And I put the stencil on the pumpkin and I was at home. 
[00:13:00]  Cutting it out?  I believe watching the Yankees.  I was cutting it out with a beer in one hand and a knife in the other.  I see no problem with that.  All right, Sam.  Thank you for burying me today.  We appreciate it.  Well, like I said, we have pictures, so.  I don't know about that.  And I trudged out to the wilderness of Wallbaums, aisle three for my pumpkins.  And wait, wait.  The reason we went out so far is because. 
[00:13:30]  All right, did you pick your little wagon and everything?  All right, listen.  Was there a whole method to picking a good wagon?  All right, listen.  I got to go.  No, no, don't hang up on me.  What, Sandy?  Don't hang up.  Go ahead.  No, what happened was they had wagons.  It was the little red wagon.  Yeah.  But there was a lot of people, so you had to wait until someone went back to their car  to empty their pumpkins to get the wagon.  You had to wait for a wagon, sure.  It's just like the Matterhorn bobsled at Disney, the fun of getting a wagon.  So you wait online for that.  At that point, I was ready to just say, forget it.  We'll just walk through the fields and get the pumpkins. 
[00:14:00]  But he insisted on the wagon.  Oh, he insisted on waiting for the wagon.  You're not going to make me look bad.  All right, thanks, Sam.  Oh, okay.  What skirt was Opie wearing?  Shut up.  I'll talk to you later.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  I wonder if he got a ride in the wagon.  Did she pull him along?  Can we finish this segment?  John?  I'm sticking up for you, Opie, because, you know, I got stuck on a hayride. 
[00:14:30]  And after hearing Sandra, I'm going to have to go back to your homo.  Your head's back in a cardboard cutout, and there's pictures to prove it.  Your head in the cardboard cutout of the pumpkin.  I make sure we left the camera at home.  She said, you got the camera?  Yeah, we got the camera.  Yeah, it's on the kitchen table.  There's no evidence, okay?  Unless there's a high-powered rifle pointed at your head in that picture of you behind  that pumpkin.  Jack.  Angelo. 
[00:15:00]  Faggot.  I mean, homo-sangelo.  David.  Remember, I brought this abuse onto myself.  Of course you did.  I did not have to bring this up.  I have one question for you.  Who are you going to dress up as for Halloween?  Is it going to be Ricky Martin, or is it going to be Barbie?  I can't get this.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Jason, are you ready to play, hi, mom, I'm in jail?  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  You got a good story?  Yeah.  What are you going to tell her?  I'm going to tell her I had marijuana.  I got caught by the cops.  Will that piss her off?  Yep.  All right, let's give her a shot.  Drugs.  Hello?  Mom?  What?  I screwed up.  What?  I'm in jail.  Why?  I have possession of marijuana.  You're kidding?  I don't know who to call.  Should I call Uncle Mark?  It's my one phone call.  Should I call Uncle Mark or something?  I'll ask you.  Is this your one phone call?  I'll have to call him.  What do you need? 
[00:16:00]  I don't know.  The call is being monitored, ma'am, by the police department.  Okay.  What does he need to do?  The judge came in and set bail at $10,000.  It's a very serious offense.  $10,000?  Well, if it was a joint or two, it would be one thing.  He was caught with 12 kilos in his trunk, obviously trying to deal.  So he's being arraigned as a dealer and not as a user. 
[00:16:30]  Okay.  Okay, when is all this and when did, where are you, where is he and where can I come see him?  I mean, I'm at the jail.  We're going to bring him to one of the city jails.  Okay.  How can I get directions to get there?  Can I get there, talk to him?  Tell me what I need to do.  Ma, what should I do?  Like a lawyer?  Yeah, you need a lawyer?  Well, he's been crying like a girl, too.  Well, I've got to get to the bottom of this. 
[00:17:00]  He's a very good person.  I've heard that before.  It's more of that bad parenting.  I've seen this before with these kids.  They're running around the streets like wild.  And now they're selling drugs?  Did you know your son was doing this?  No, no.  Not to mention with the being found with the prostitute in the car?  That's, that's, what is that all about?  Don't, don't even deny it, son.  Okay, please, please.  Don't even, he's already given a full confession before he even talked to a lawyer, 
[00:17:30]  which just shows how smart he is.  Okay, officer.  Son, Sonny.  I, I, I didn't know what to do.  Oh, okay, officer.  Yes, ma'am.  Please, please help me, okay?  I'm, I'm three hours away.  Please give me directions of how to get there and where you are, and I will be there.  Well, by that time, he's going to be transported out of here.  I'm not sure where they're taking him, but I'm, I'm sure which jail we do take him to, 
[00:18:00]  they're going to like him real, uh, real good there tonight, if you know what I mean.  He's pretty good looking.  Yeah, he, he better not drop that soap, if you know what I mean.  Please, sir.  I think, uh, Bubba, Bubba's going to like him in the shower room, if you know what I  mean, ma'am.  Listen, officer.  Yes, ma'am.  We, you're a good family, blah, blah, blah.  I've heard it before, miss.  I've heard it before.  Okay, you've heard it before.  All right, all right.  Oh, he's had enough.  He's had enough.  He's had enough. 
[00:18:30]  Mom, you're on the radio.  He's, oh, oh my goodness.  Mom?  He couldn't take it anymore.  Mom?  What?  You're on the radio.  Huh?  It's a joke.  Oh, Jason.  Happy Mother's Day.  Happy Mother's Day, Mom.  Well, he is a good kid, but he's written out of the will.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs. 
[00:19:00]  Wait, wait a minute.  That can't be right.  Vote now for your favorite WOW contestant on opieandanthony.com.  Then August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  My goodness.  So what's going on with EverQuest, Anthony?  A tragedy in the news here.  Death of a game addict.  Get this story.  And this tool mother of this tool 21-year-old, Sean Woolley.  He loved online computer game, an online computer game so much that he played it just minutes before his suicide.  21-year-old Hudson man. 
[00:20:00]  Addicted to EverQuest.  That's your game.  That's the game I play, Opie.  That's your drug of choice.  That's my drug of choice.  It's been called EverQueer.  EverCrack.  I'm not alone.  Our own Keith Kopp over here loves the game.  I was like the drug addict who kind of said, hey, Keith, I'm playing this game here.  Why don't you check it out?  Exactly.  And it's a horror show.  It has consumed my life.  It has totally consumed his life to the point where he now, like the first thing he says to me or I say to him when he comes in the building, he goes, dude, what level are you up to, man? 
[00:20:30]  What are you doing?  I call and leave messages on his machine and stuff like that.  Yeah, he leaves messages about what server he's on and what he's got, more equipment.  It just takes up your life.  It takes up every minute of your life.  It's a massive multiplayer online role-playing game.  EverQuest.  Great graphics now.  It's 3D virtual world.  They got over 400,000 people worldwide subscribed to this, playing it. 
[00:21:00]  It's what they call a never-ending fantasy game.  Well, Sean Woolley shot himself to death in his apartment.  His mother blames EverQuest.  That is why I unload my gun before I play this game every single time.  And I put the bullets in the car.  Very good.  And I have it padlocked and I let my girlfriend hold the key.  You have to.  You get angry.  So let me get this straight because this lunatic shot himself over a computer game. 
[00:21:30]  I swear, you didn't tell me what's going to happen with the story.  She's going to now try to get this game banned, right?  Well, she's going to sue the game, first of all, and try to get some quick cash.  Great.  And then she wants all kinds of new warnings put on these games.  Ha-ha!  That's right.  Well, she's hiding, attorney.  She blames the game.  It's like any other addiction, Elizabeth Woolley said, the mother.  Either you die, go insane, or you quit. 
[00:22:00]  My son died.  The virtual world of EverQuest, of course, monster-slaying missions and quests.  And the success makes the character stronger as they interact with other characters from all over the world.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Exactly.  Believe me, if you play, you know the game.  And a lot of people play online gaming.  So you understand what kind of environment you're in.  People say you're very vulnerable to becoming addicted to EverQuest. 
[00:22:30]  This guy, this addiction service worker, says that people who are prone to this are people that are prone to boredom, lonely, sexually anorexic, have low self-esteem and poor body image.  And they say they accuse the makers of ever quest of creating an addictive game. 
[00:23:00]  It could have been created in a less addictive way.  But that would be like the difference between powdered cocaine and crack.  And then Parker, this guy from the clinic, goes on to say, talk about a 21-year-old college student who stopped going to class within eight weeks after starting to play EverQuest in his senior year.  And after playing the game for 36 hours straight, had a psychotic break because of sleep deprivation.  Whatever.  I'll do what I want.  He thought the characters had come out of the game and were chasing him. 
[00:23:30]  I can't wait to get to this point.  That sounds like a pisser.  I want the characters to chase me.  I had those same feelings, you know, staying up all night cramming for a final exam.  Right.  Whatever.  He was running through his neighborhood having hallucinations.  I can't think of a drug that could have taken where he would have, oh, a drug that he could have taken, which would have had him disintegrated to the point he was in only 15 short weeks. 
[00:24:00]  Sean Woolley's character in EverQuest could have traumatized him.  He may have had his character slain in combat and not be able to recover it, which is very, especially, cannot leave the house until you recover that body.  Let's say, you cannot turn the computer off.  I'll explain, Opie.  I understand.  Let's say you're battling in a faraway realm, but your body, your character, has to be bound to a city.  So when you die, you reappear wherever you're bound. 
[00:24:30]  Now, if you're way far away from the city and you die, now you've got to run without any of your equipment from your city binding point to where you died.  If you don't know where you died, you're lost.  After a week goes by, your body disappears with everything on it.  So everything you've earned, everything that you've played years for, disappears.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Exactly.  So they're saying that perhaps he lost his body and his goods and his treasures or an artifact, 
[00:25:00]  or he had been cast out of one of the game's social clubs called Guilds.  Maybe he was an outcast.  Or how about this?  Perhaps he was a douchebag in real life and should have just gotten a girlfriend and gotten a Hummer.  And I'm glad he shot himself because he saves us the trouble of having to deal with him.  Elizabeth Woolley remembers her son was betrayed by an EverQuest associate he'd been adventuring with for six months.  Sean's online brother-in-arms stole all of his money from his character and refused to give it back.  Isn't that kind of like real life? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, what a bunch of faggots.  He was so depressed and in tears.  I said he couldn't trust those people.  It's only a game, I tried to tell him.  She didn't understand, Keith.  No, she does not.  She doesn't understand.  There's a buddy of mine that, well, I don't know this person.  He happens to be a fan of the show.  Right.  Or I sometimes group with.  A lot of people online on EverQuest, fans of the show.  Exactly.  My pal, I know him as Brody on the Iona Row server.  And he happens to be a 19-year-old college student who on a regular basis blows off class or work and spends the whole day. 
[00:26:00]  And who am I to say?  Because I blow off the whole day and will play this game for hours on hours.  But how long?  Hold on, you're a cop.  You're not supposed to be blowing off your day.  We kind of need you in the streets of New York.  College kid, whatever, man.  Somebody will catch them.  Put down the EverQuest there, Keith.  And you were going to ask me, how long is the longest stretch you have played this game? 
[00:26:30]  I would say 14 to 16 hours.  14 to 16 hours.  Get up on a day, like 9 o'clock, just sit in the chair with like a bowl of Froot Loops.  Can you pause it, though, if you go to the bathroom?  No, there's no pause.  No, no, no.  You can't pause it.  If you leave the computer and you're not in a safe spot, you can come back.  And while you were going to the bathroom, let's say a griffin could fly by and kill you.  I wouldn't know what a griffin is.  It's a large, flying, lion-headed creature. 
[00:27:00]  Why are you looking at me like that?  Because it's just awful.  Griffins stink.  You might be able to, you know, hide somewhere, but you're never sure unless you log off that you're safe.  So a lot of times, if we order out, we order maybe some sushi, and the bell rings, I'll get up, and as I'm paying the guy, I'm looking the other way.  Yeah, take the money.  Give me the food.  Give me the food.  And I'm just looking to see if I'm getting attacked.  Is it a griffin, or do they just show an Eddie Griffin movie, and your character shoots himself? 
[00:27:30]  I also, since we're on the subject quickly, I must thank Ted Yule and the wonderful people from the Cats and Hats Guild.  That, Opie, they got me.  They helped me get my epic weapon over the weekend, and I'm very happy.  I am now level 51, shaman barbarian, with my epic weapon.  Oh, man.  Yes.  Yes, Opie?  You lost me at, there was a tragedy today. 
[00:28:00]  Hey, Keith, what level are you?  I happen to be a 35 Paladin.  My name is Salvin on the Iona Row server, and I will be trading WOW t-shirts for more equipment.  Oh, look at them!  If anyone cares to send me a message.  Some guy, he just hung up, I was going to go to him, but he probably had to get back to the game.  Yeah.  He said that he spent five hours making keys.  What does that mean?  Making keys.  I make arrows, four to five hours at a time.  I'm an alchemist, so I make things like potions that make people faster, 
[00:28:30]  and I can sell them.  Now, wait a minute.  Now, here.  Now, wait a minute.  Why would you make arrows?  Because you could sell them to other players in the game and get platinum,  and with that platinum, you buy better equipment.  But how long does it take to make an arrow?  Oh, Keith, you're the arrow maker, not me.  I could sit for maybe an hour and make 200, maybe more.  Now, as you get better at your skill of making these things,  you can make them faster and cheaper, 
[00:29:00]  and you don't have as many failures in your attempts to make them.  Now, we pay to play this game, too.  We pay approximately $10 a month.  Yeah, it's a subscriber.  Or you could pay quarterly.  Now, they just came out with the one-year or two-year agreement  for 30% savings of $109 for a year or $190.  Now, Ant, will you be paying $190?  I have to ask if they have the 10-year plan,  because I believe I could get an even better discount.  All right, how does the game end?  Oh, no. 
[00:29:30]  Actually, we're hearing something that says,  Sean, with a bullet in the head.  Actually, yeah, we do have audio of the game ending.  There it is.  Good night.  Actually, it says a game without end.  How does it pull people in?  A key component is the game can be played indefinitely.  There's always people populating the online world,  and it's a social structure of the game.  The graphics are thrilling.  They say they just haul you in.  Do you mean forever and ever, Ant?  You can just play forever? 
[00:30:00]  Yes, you can play forever, as long as the game is on there.  This type of thing is becoming huge,  where people are more concerned about their online life  than their regular life.  Sean Woolley was overweight, worked in a pizza restaurant,  and lived alone in his apartment the last months of his life.  May have depended on EverQuest,  depended on EverQuest to provide the life he really wanted to live.  Are you making that up, or is that true?  No, that's what it says.  A fat guy in a pizza place shoots himself?  He should have.  If you're fat and work in a pizza place, 
[00:30:30]  follow his lead, even if you don't have a computer.  Let me go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  What's up, man?  I played that game for about, I don't know, two months,  then I quit my job and played it for about four months straight.  That's all I did.  Actually, my name is Ubermuzzle.  I'm a level 50 necromancer.  What in Norton's face?  What?  A level 50?  You're a level zero zilch.  I know all about it.  Got to go for it.  All right, Bob. 
[00:31:00]  You're a level zero zilch.  I mean, it's hard to say, because Keith and Anne are my friends.  Keith is, and I know, a cop, and he lives a life,  and Anne's obviously on the show, lives a life.  So if people are living their lives and doing it, that's fine.  But when I hear him saying giving up school  and then blowing their head off,  I just want to, I wish he would have shot his mother first.  That's the only thing I can say.  Well, she's going to be a problem now.  She will attempt to take this game away from everybody else  that could enjoy it in a way that doesn't affect their lives.  Just because her Christmases are now going to be a little lonelier.  Elbow on the ribs. 
[00:31:30]  I don't like playing a game that people don't have lawsuits against.  That's pretty much the rule of thumb I adhere to.  I like games.  When Kingpin came out, there was a huge outcry  because it was such a violent game.  I like the games.  Explain Kingpin real fast.  Kingpin's great.  That one rocks.  You're a guy, and you're just screwing up people in the city.  You start with a lead pipe.  You can beat hookers, steal their money,  shoot people, shoot gangbangers,  sell drugs. 
[00:32:00]  It was great.  Well, weren't they trying to pull Grand Theft Auto 3?  Of course they were trying to pull that.  A little message to Rockstar.  Do not be pussies.  Nah.  We're all waiting for Grand Theft Auto 4.  It's going to be a while.  Don't back down.  You know, there's a lot of the people that are into trying to ban things like this.  They're more violent and crazy than Grand Theft Auto 3.  Please.  You know, it's funny.  They're so worried about computer games and the violence and the bad things for their kids.  Long before computer games, blacks were being lynched in the South.  So enough with blaming computer games because you're bad parents. 
[00:32:30]  That's what it is.  Sean was playing 12 hours a day.  He wasn't supposed to because he was epileptic.  The game would cause him to fly into epileptic seizures.  Probably the last eight times he had seizures because of his stints playing EverQuest.  Oh, what a zilch.  Big goose egg.  Willie understands her son had problems beyond EverQuest and she tried to help him contact a mental health program.  Let's see what he had problems with. 
[00:33:00]  Diagnosed him with depression, schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack of desire for social relationships,  little or no sex drive, and a limited range of emotions in social settings.  This fed right into EverQuest playing.  It was the perfect escape.  Pete, what's going on?  You were talking about the guys playing 16, 18 hours.  Somebody said 36.  Right.  I had a 55th level magician in my group. 
[00:33:30]  We went up and played in hate for 72 and a half hours straight.  You're a level what?  What, sir?  You're a level what?  55th level magician.  I no longer.  I quit playing EverQuest about six months ago.  Oh, you did.  You're clean and sober.  What happened?  He's out.  What made you quit?  What got you up the boot, sir?  Was it the feel of a warm female mouth for the first time?  What made you quit?  I walked in one day and decided I was done. 
[00:34:00]  Cold turkey?  You did it.  Wow.  People talk about it like drugs when they say they stop.  They're like, no, man.  You know, I had to get out of that.  I had to stop.  Now, of course, I did go from heroin to mescaline right back in because I'm playing Dark Age  of Camelot right now.  Oh, yeah.  That seems to be the one other people are picking up.  What's the highest level you've ever heard of to get to?  60 is the highest level there is.  60 is the highest level there is.  As of now.  They might come out with an expansion that could push the levels up higher for those people  that are 60 now and have nowhere to go.  I'm at 51, but I'm going to take my time for the next nine levels. 
[00:34:30]  Sir, how did you quit at level 55 when you could have got to 60 and been like the head  EverQuest person?  Hell no.  There's so many 60s.  It's not funny, Mark.  They might have sent you a little wizard hat.  Anthony, tell them how hard it is to get from 51 to 60.  It's very hard.  It takes a long time.  I'm not sure why.  There's a lot of things that are hard, too.  So what?  It's hard to get hepatitis C.  It doesn't mean I want to do it.  It's hard.  So what?  You know what else is hard?  A black mule.  It doesn't mean I want to sit on it.  A black mule. 
[00:35:00]  God damn, is that funny.  All right, Pete.  Take care.  Listen to you, Columbus, man.  Norton, you rule.  Thanks, Pete.  Thank you, Columbus.  Steve, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  God, dude, I have so much to say.  I'm calling from Cleveland.  I've played EverQuest since the day it came out.  I play with my brother.  I have a 60 cleric, a 60 enchanter, a 60 druid.  So you can tell I spent a lot of my time on there.  How many years ago is this, sir?  How many years have you been playing? 
[00:35:30]  I've been playing since beta.  I'll throw over three, about three years.  Can you enchant some electric for me or something?  I can do anything you want, but I'm on the rook, so if you want to play on rook, look for big.  You know what?  I've actually hashed around the idea of getting a second computer just so I can make my own teammates.  I dual comp.  I play my enchanter and my player get one.  Dual account, so now you can have two people that team up and then help each other out.  Yeah, I do that.  I know people have done that.  Now, another thing, if you look on eBay right now, people sell these characters on eBay. 
[00:36:00]  And I think, like, Sony is against it.  They don't like it.  But people build the character up.  Let's say there's a level 60.  He's got, like, some really good equipment on him.  They sell their accounts for upwards of $1,000.  What do you, like, say this guy is really obviously a good player, which is like being the guy who's banging the most fat chicks.  What do you do now with the game, bro?  Do you still play it?  I hung up on him.  You know what happens at that point?  You still play because it's a social environment. 
[00:36:30]  Do you go into chat rooms?  Are you ever in a chat room talking with people?  Kate, not really, no.  But I talk in instant messages.  I'm not trying to.  Okay, instant message.  It's the environment is the same because there's a chat window.  So as you're in this environment, instead of just chatting, you're off doing things.  You team up with, like, a few people to slay something that's a little bigger than you would be able to do alone.  Norton is a whole online society.  But here's the difference.  He said it's kind of like the chat room.  No, it's not. 
[00:37:00]  All right, you're chasing around a lion-headed bird man who might throw an arrow at you.  And I'm trying to get some girl to give me a Hummer in a parking lot at Rascals.  That's the difference.  I'm not talking to another.  I'm not talking to a fat pizza shop worker.  Hey, put the gun down, son.  I'll send you some stuff that I have accumulated.  No.  I'm always like, yeah, it's me.  Hey, glad you enjoy the show.  Would you?  You got any pics?  I don't know.  You know, I'm looking at the phones, and I see a lot of people that play this game.  Hopefully on my server. 
[00:37:30]  So I can get some.  Oh, hey, potty mouth.  Hopefully you can keep the potty mouth.  Some good stuff.  Thanks.  400,000 people play this game online.  How many people were Nazis?  Does that mean it's good?  Actually, in fact, the other day, you can group with up to six people.  And the other day, I got into a group.  And you put on group chat, so you can only speak with the people.  So you can speak with the people in your group.  And all of a sudden, what were you getting?  I was actually playing with Nazis because they were all typing in German. 
[00:38:00]  I had no idea.  Because it's worldwide.  So you get a group of German people.  You get in there, and you're seeing German text.  And it's multicultural.  Look on the bright side.  400,000 people that are in the streets of...  Exactly.  Excellent way.  A long way to walk for that, but an excellent way to look at that.  Wes, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Yo.  Yeah, one of us would play for about maybe like one and a half or two days.  Then he'd wake one of us up.  He'd go to sleep.  One of us would take over. 
[00:38:30]  Jesus.  You know what I would do?  I would play the game and then lose your man and not wake you.  And you'd come back to no game.  And I'd be laughing.  But I mean, it was just so true because we were in one spot the entire time.  We were waiting for one piece of equipment to drop.  Yeah, see, sometimes you do something.  Opie, you camp a location.  Damn right.  This means you go to a location and one of the computer-generated characters will appear at some point in the game.  You must slay him to get a piece that he's holding that you either turn in later for a quest or get right off the bat. 
[00:39:00]  Maybe he's got some good armor that you want to take.  But the trick is some of these computer-generated characters...  Takes like a week to spawn.  Take a week to spawn in that location.  And people are fighting over the camp.  You have to sit there for a week.  And we didn't get it.  That's the worst part.  And you didn't get it in the end?  No.  It didn't drop anything.  You should get it in the end.  I was going to say.  Seems like none of you guys are getting it.  What?  All right.  Let me go to Matt.  We've got to take a break.  That would be preferable to play in that game. 
[00:39:30]  What are you doing?  I'm getting it in the end.  I can't talk right now.  Matt, what's up?  Yo, what's up, Opie and Anthony?  How's it going?  All right.  I play EverQuest like all day, every day.  And that's all I do.  How old are you, son?  What?  How old are you, son?  I'm 14.  I'm almost 15.  There's a trench coat and a tragedy in your future.  You do know that, don't you?  No, there's not, Norton.  I have 51 days played, 18 hours and 42 minutes.  I do. 
[00:40:00]  I'm addicted.  It says you spend all day making beer.  What does that mean?  I, uh...  Oh, he's a brewer.  I'm a brewer.  There you go.  Oh, you brew, so you make the beer.  I'm a dwarf, too.  And then he sells it.  He's a dwarven little brewer.  And he sells the beer.  And what is your pally friend, Juan, on the Aone Row server?  Because that's what I'm on.  Okay, dude, whatever you got.  I'll send you t-shirts.  Anthony will autograph some shirts or something.  I'll get you whatever you need, kid.  Just keep sending it.  That's insane.  Do you want to know my name? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm a 58 warrior.  My name is Kalari.  T-A-L-A-R-I.  I need a pen.  I need a pen.  It's Kalari.  T-A-L-A-R-I.  You guys are losing it.  All right, thanks, Matt.  Okay.  Let me go to Mike, and then we've got to take a break.  Go, Mike.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, Mike?  I was, uh, part of you guys.  Actually, Anthony on, uh, Drenal.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, quite a while back.  Laguna.  Yeah, I remember that.  Okay.  Yeah, see?  He's one of the buds that I've played with online. 
[00:41:00]  Really?  Yeah, and I also won Norton tickets in Cleveland, so hopefully on the day you guys come out there,  I'll be able to come up to the studio and irritate you guys.  Hopefully you can tear yourself away from that computer.  F***ing Norton.  Ooh, hey.  All right.  All right.  That's the show.  Don't try to get on my good side.  Ha.  We'll be back with the Opium Anthony Show.  Stay there.  Opium Anthony Show.  1027-9988. 
[00:41:30]  Where were we?  I got to hear now about, uh, Sandy going at Chippendale.  Mmm.  and why rick's wife didn't go i could just picture him getting off his you ain't effing going  you ain't going get your spanish blood up i did not yeah why i don't even well she doesn't know  the girls at uh the sandy that never matters though yeah no no sandy right i've jumped on  a bunch of bachelor parties because you know just because you know it was gonna be fun like  you don't know the guy who cares he's not gonna care you know one of his friends that's all it 
[00:42:00]  chippendales  so uh yeah she had a weekend in the city with the girlies  and uh they went to chippendales for the bachelorette party  and uh i'm hanging outside my my house uh yesterday afternoon and she comes pulling up  after her weekend in the city with a limp i might add  and whoa and a stiff neck 
[00:42:30]  swear dude from what swear what'd you say it was from because she was spinning around so much to  to take it all in anthony and she pulled the muscle in her neck a limp and a stiff neck  and i'm just laughing all right so uh so i'm sitting there on the porch enjoying a cold one  and she goes you want to see the pictures from uh from our night out and i'm assuming she's just 
[00:43:00]  going to show me you know the safe pictures right maybe we are maybe she showed me the whole the  whole roll i honestly i don't care i really don't it's just funny because the the things i saw in  these pictures i'm like if i came home from a strip club like privilege or something and it was just  it was uh it was just me with a bunch of girls touching me and stuff yeah it's over johnny yeah  and every guy out there will admit the same damn thing all right so you're gonna take pictures 
[00:43:30]  i'm gonna go look at me here's my face between these two huge cans right and i'm grabbing this  chick's ass right and she's got my junk she's trying to tell me it's different i'm like all right  whatever so i'm going through the pictures first of all i guess uh with the chippendales thing you  know the bachelorette parties and stuff i guess it's just uh just a insane scene girls just losing  their effing minds a lot of ladies that are really old i guess yeah well this is their way to get out  if especially girls uh like the older women that you're talking about that don't really get any at  home oh they go out and go mad all right so uh i guess first of all they carry you into the place 
[00:44:00]  what so you have like these uh naked basically naked guys with ball bags on  yeah they got the marble bag can you imagine going to privilege and you know one of the strippers  carries you in i was just wearing a little g-string covering up for a patch so the first picture i see  is um she have to be a real big stripper so the first picture i see is sandy in the arms of this 
[00:44:30]  huge naked black guy whoa huge black guy bringing her in huge the guy had to be at least six four  at least at least a freak of nature he must have seen her walking and go yeah i'm all pick her up  had a little bow tie and a ball bag that was it that's what they wear the little bow ties with the  little white collar right like oh where did my shirt go all that's left is the collar and the tie  and i'm completely naked and look at all the pimples on my body from all the steroids i do 
[00:45:00]  anyway so they they carrying them if they carry them in carry them in she's just like how like  like like a fireman's carry a cradle carry pretty much uh just picture like a caveman you know  deciding you know i kind of cradle her oh yeah all right and that's how they take it to the seats i  guess good good i don't know if they do it for every woman and the seats are all men's faces  i think it would be impossible because there's got to be uh i don't know a few hundred women in the 
[00:45:30]  in this club i guess they all get carried in so i'm assuming you know they just carry the cute ones  in or the uh you know the bachelorette parties in whatever yeah because think there's probably some  real heifers right that's like i'm not carrying her so then i just see pictures of just just just  just naked guys basically with their ball bags there there's pictures of sandy dancing with all of  with their bachelorette party they're pulling on the g-string they got their dollars out they're  basically drooling now i saw on hbo real sex or some of those sex shows and they show the women in 
[00:46:00]  chippendales or comparable places and the guys that are wearing the uh uh ball bag um marble bag things  it's almost like a banana hammock and they're like thrusting forward and backward so this thing is  jiggling in the girls faces right in their face well you know what yeah pretty much just leaving  bruises on their chin with their junk but you know what i don't i don't really care i really don't 
[00:46:30]  all right no i really don't if you know if san and her friends want to go out and do that that's fine  and if they want to take pictures that's fine but i'm sitting there like looking at these pictures  going if i brought the same pictures home there'd be hell to pay oh my god hell to pay and i'm like  what is the difference she goes oh the difference is you know they don't really touch you or anything  but in a strip club the girls boobs they're in your face when you when they do their lap dances and  stuff so as a typical guy i'm like uh no they don't they don't they don't do that no and then she's 
[00:47:00]  she's like who are you kidding i i got one of these lap dances and i had the boobs in my face  girls get different lap dances from strippers and i'm like oh yeah i was there i forgot about that  but girls get different lap dances from strippers than guys get yeah because the girls really work  because they know the girls are uncomfortable and the girls are allowed to touch the strippers  for some bizarre reason with uh guys here here's the lap dance a guy gets sit down pretty much  it's a reenactment of the electric chair strap in put your arms on the sides they might as well 
[00:47:30]  just put the metal bolts over them right because you're not allowed to uh right even brush the thigh  or nothing the cups come up from the uh the arms of the chair locks you in don't touch or a rock  over there is gonna pound your face in so i'm like at the nicer clubs there is no touching none  whatsoever hey at the other places you know well who knows what goes on in the champagne room  yeah don't go to the champagne room so i'm just going through picture after picture with you know  just these girls just losing their effing mind over these guys with pimples on their freaking shoulders 
[00:48:00]  greg from lynn uh asking is there such thing as male body glitter yeah it's called jizz  i want to come home with that on you  come home with that male body glitter on you because the uh the the ball bag things they  wear weren't just ball bags right they they uh fit around the guy and look like an elephant's trunk  right and they're smacking the girls in the face with these things come on bill what's going on 
[00:48:30]  hey uh that big black guy that carried in sandy you said he was six four yeah at least uh yeah just  wanted to know how tall he was why i don't know just ask her take care guys he's six four i'll be and  then he wants to know how tall he is oh say the ridiculous size of his junk would be six foot four  inches is it true that the guy that uh carried sandy in he had no arms is that true  jerry hey what's going on hey man hey oak did you put a black light up to your girl when she 
[00:49:00]  came home that night oh my god i didn't need to she had the stiff neck and she walked with a limp  like one of those hotel sheets you do the math the math thanks guys you do the map you do the math  turn on the black lights it looks like a peter max painting  god damn oh that's awful but there is a huge double standard like that right because the guys can't 
[00:49:30]  you can't even say you went to these places a lot of guys married guys they have to lie and say they  went to the somewhere else with the guys when they went to for a quick beer after work at the strip club  or something meanwhile the girls are announcing that they're going for weeks and they uh go with  all their friends and then they come back with these war stories that oh my god yeah guys next time  you're in a strip club you know bring a camera take pictures and then show them to your your your wife  or girlfriend and see the reaction you get you'll never get out of there alive first of all if you're

[00:50:30]  whether my girlfriend's a hoe or not right on thanks nick all right yeah i was hoping i was hoping to  reap the benefits i'm like all right she's all sexed up seeing these uh these animals what  happened with these uh these sculptured but the sculptured bodies and stuff i'm like all right  she's gonna be all sexed up a little more than usual did you get some so all right what so all right  oh my god i can't even oh my god i'm like i can't even reap the benefits of this so then my  sick come on crime scene well that's what i'm gonna say my my sick brother brett who came up with the 
[00:51:00]  term crime scene sex he goes you gotta do the crime scene sex you gotta you gotta didn't do the  crime scene sex dude come on why not just didn't do it oh my brother loves the crime scene sex loves  it you what what's wrong with the crime scene sex loves it uh than uh more than regular sex why is it  so much worse that uh you're doing it during that time than uh not i don't see a problem with it i'm not 
[00:51:30]  a big fan of that to begin with maybe a uh maybe a little yeah without getting too graphic fine but  a little i mean there's been some instances i know where i uh got a home from the hotel room and the  police bashed down my door after housekeeping called someone had to die in this bed they need a body  that's crime scene they need a body john what's up hey guys how are you as i told you screener i 
[00:52:00]  worked for years with chippendales and six and a half years with the billy dean's all mail review out  in long island billy dean's yeah oh billy dean's yeah that's kind of like uh low budget chippendales  were you just banging all the time you know i to be honest i did in the beginning the first year  because i was young and it was new see that's and it was fun i think that's the difference too  because most of uh most of the the the female strippers don't want to like sleep with the  patrons please i don't think you'd find one of them all right but i was being polite i'm sure 
[00:52:30]  there's a few but i i think you guys uh the male strippers out there john you guys are like  you know you see a whole different mentality with us yeah you guys want to get some action like like  you know the deal with a girl does a lot of guys right the girl does a lot of guys she's a whore if a  guy does it he's got a you know he's got a headdress full of feathers you know but that's the whole  thing too if there's some chick there if there's a chick that goes to one of these things and she  wants to get nailed there's these guys the dancer guys that are gonna oblige but if there's a guy  who's all horned up and he goes into these strip clubs odds of him walking out with one of the 
[00:53:00]  strippers please yeah right please that's the whole gig that's the whole gig is draining the pockets of  the guys that think they got a shot at one of these chicks  hey john  hey guys it put me through dental school and i have an office right here on 300 comac road in comac  right on  and uh  you're on every night in my office  john really fast though uh  go ahead  how bad do you have to fake it when there's just a pig in front of you  oh my god i was you know i was gonna bring that up also you get these  these women that you see these stuff my god this is a bachelorette party 
[00:53:30]  who that who in god's name is marrying her next saturday you know and you get violently ill they  touch you they they shove the dollar you know in the back and their fingers go up certain spots  oh god you know and it's a big joke backstage where you know you come out you gotta be real  serious but it's just it's a mockery with us backstage as to what we're gonna do when we come  out you know were you a cop a fireman or an astronaut oh did you wear one of the costumes uh  uh... with the the cowboy uh... that i think about how you are so cheesy i don't know how 
[00:54:00]  how about it how many of you guys are gay  there with you know what it was kind of strange there was two different clicks there was  the guys you knew who were gay they did a lot of the road stuff a lot of the stuff where they  went away and dressed up and went to the woman's house or to the restaurant of the you know the  the village hall whatever they had this you know the events center but uh... you you  i did it on the side women as old as seventy and then they  you would do backyard parties and feel just so cheap 
[00:54:30]  you know  i can remember one house the guy the guy constantly requested myself and two other guys  i'm just hearing a girl say that she feels so cheap i've never heard a guy say  say oh i i felt so cheap  well there was this rich couple out in west hampton and she would be able to hand pick  our three or four guys and he would pick his three or four and halfway through this  big beach party they would separate the beach and  the women were just using the men would use the girls you know from a different agency  yeah and uh... we made a lot of money that guys fought for that party  nice but like i said it put me through dental school so and i'm happily married with two 
[00:55:00]  two kids all right john thank you you guys are great man take care of yourselves  all right buddy bye bye bye you go there's a couple more interesting calls coming in here  let's go to jj what's up make it fast  yo what's up oh hey  yo my girlfriend did the same thing this weekend kid  yeah she went to a strip club she came home she's like oh you want to see the pictures i'm like i don't want to see no guy's  sack on your chin i don't want to see that i'm like no thanks  i could even get i could even get later i think because she had a freak period  what what what what the hell's happening here 
[00:55:30]  well they they sync up anthony  is that it pretty much uh there's a  i would say over 50 percent of the women walking around manhattan right now are having their uh their time of the month  yeah oh yeah they sync up  how about that when girls work together they sync up  all right jay thank you  bye let's go to dave  dave what's up  hey guys how you doing  um two years ago i picked my wife up at a bachelor party at four o'clock in the morning  because her and her buddies were too loaded to drive home  she gets in the car first thing she says to me  is i kissed a boy 
[00:56:00]  yeah i kissed a boy  can you imagine you reverse the situation  she picks me up drunk at four o'clock in the morning  right i kissed one of the strippers  exactly  she would behead you  next morning i did i told her next morning what she said she didn't remember  yeah  but i used that one  ah it's cool man the girls can do all that stuff  it's a double standard you know  yeah but i use  the women talk about the double standards all the time  they got one on us here  they're allowed to take the pictures and kiss boys and stuff at these places  yeah but you let them get away with it  and then you can do what you want  you can dine out on that for months 
[00:56:30]  right  all right dave thank you  bye  that's good  uh ryan  hey what's up man yeah my girl went like a couple of weeks ago with her friends and uh  it's just funny because it's just like  he brought back pictures and they just act like  they just look like animals man  it's just i know what you're saying about the double standard or you know it's like  it's a right for them to like  get yam bag summed off their chin but uh you know we can't look at some boobs  they get crazy and stuff but then the whole time it's um  it's usually  oh those strip clubs you know  ah it's disgusting  the guys going in there and doing this that 
[00:57:00]  meanwhile like you said they just  lose their effing mind when they go in there  i think they pump in nitrous  all right folks  i'm glad that she had a good time  it's just funny that  they can take pictures and stuff and it's normal  dominic  male bands have been doing it for about five years  all i gotta say is  there's no comparison  to the way women act  and the way men act at these places  yeah  the women just totally get nuts  men have to basically just sit there  there's bouncers everywhere  you know and for us when we do these shows 
[00:57:30]  there's really not bouncers anywhere to watch our backs  right  these women could just go  basically wild bring scissors in  they could pretty much like you know  i'll actually cut our g-strings off  which is  wait a minute  what  they bring scissors in  and they cut off  they bring scissors in  they hide them  and when you're not looking  they actually try to cut your g off  your junk  you know what  if you did that  if a guy did that in a strip club  forget it  we arrested  arrested  you'd never make it out  you'd be lucky if you were still walking  by the time they threw you out to the sidewalk 
[00:58:00]  cutting your colon  imagine you have a scissor in a strip club  hey  ten bikers  they've been in their pocketbooks  alright  that's funny Dominic  alright man  you guys take care  Tony you're next on WNAW  what's up ONA  two quickies  one  I know some of these guys that dance  they work out of my gym  yeah  best excuse  oh I got all these pimples from tanning  okay  and this is like  three out of four of them are black guys  alright  dude  dude  my ex-girlfriend used to go to strip bars all the time 
[00:58:30]  plus you got your standards  you know  the body glitter  the lipstick  all of that crap  she comes home four in the morning  she smells like a bottle of tropical coconut oil  uh oh  I'm like  okay  yeah what'd you do  go to a 24 hour tanning booth  you skank  hey  we do half of that crap  we die  uh yeah  yeah she's just having fun  dude  these guys got a call in  they got horror stories  women with the press-on nails  going into the unknown  right  think they automatically  they have carte blanche 
[00:59:00]  to be proctologists  guys with scratches  guys with scratches  gashes on them  these women are out of their minds  we pull this  we're in the alleyway  sucking food out of a straw  for the rest of my life  that's right  that's true  thanks tony  glad it fellas  I told you to stay out of here  a couple more and we'll move on  uh  day it looks like  day  yeah  what's up  yo listen  I had this  well I was married a couple of years ago  right  and these strippers broke up my wedding  my marriage man  I was sitting up there  and she said she's going to some bachelor party 
[00:59:30]  so I let her go  you know blanche, red, party, whatever  hang out  I'm a big 70s fan or whatever  and I have blacklight posters in my room  yeah  she came home  you know with the spandex on  she's like  oh I had a good time or whatever  drunk as hell  and now she's walking to the bathroom  there's a damn stain  in the back of her pants man  wait a minute  like that was glowing under the blacklight?  yeah I didn't know about it  and she didn't know about it either  and I'm like  yo what the hell is that?  and she's like  oh nothing  somebody spilled the drink on it  so I told my friends about it  and they told me  what shows up  with the blacklight 
[01:00:00]  went home  marriage is over  that's funny  that's not funny  that's horrible man  that's funny man  alright  going in is the best  see you later  alright  that's really good  I love the strip clubs Tony  I go to Chippendales  helps me take my mind  off the ass cans  I bring the scissors  I try to play grab bag  I love him Tony  Lisa  hey what are you doing?  your fiance works at  Hunkamania?  he works at Hunkamania  nice  and I've been to many shows 
[01:00:30]  at Hunkamania  Chippendales  and the whole nine yards  Hunkamania  and I have to say  it's totally  totally different  there are crazy ladies  at these shows  he does come home  scratched and  buttons torn off  his shirt  and stuff like that  they do get nuts  but nothing's allowed  to go on like  at a strip bar  or a girls dance  see  this is a fallacy  totally  I worked at a strip club  I'm at a dance  I worked as a hostess  totally totally different 
[01:01:00]  no way  from what you see  these girls do  as opposed to  if you go to like  Hunkamania  there's no private room  there's no champagne room  they don't carry  like you guys said  they don't carry  all these girls in  there are some pretty  hefty girls  that could not even  be lifted  look  I've never  I have never gone  into a private room  I've never gone  into the champagne room  if I've been to a strip club  it's sitting there  at the bar  or whatever  you're drinking some beer  and you throw some dollars 
[01:01:30]  and they sit on your lap  they put the boobs  in the face  I don't like  the strip of smell  getting on me  it's totally different  you know  what girls in this  for guys  meanwhile  they're grabbing man ass  and shaking genitalia  in their face  right in front of everybody  though  it's not  it's more of like  a theatrical show  it's a theatrical show  when the guys dance  oh god  you know something  your boyfriend does this  yeah  that's why you have  this whole take on it  it's so you can  it's so you can 
[01:02:00]  rationalize it  the way you do  he's in Aida  Opie  he's on Broadway  he's doing  Jekyll and Hyde  a boyfriend's  in Jekyll and Hyde  speaking of Aida  and they're  they're sneaking  he took Aida  no Aida Tony  they're  they're sneaking  scissors in and stuff  okay  yeah  anyway guys  love you  alright  bye bye  he comes home  with scratches  and buttons ripped off  but you know  it's a play  he's doing  the Lion King  she rationalized it 
[01:02:30]  believe me  those girls are getting  a lot more  than guys are getting  I'm going to be a reference  for you fellas  there you go  right  I um  I think Opie's fear  the crime scene sex  stems back to the  bloody Honda seat  wow pretty much  I don't know  what the hell  was going on  with that girl  I think she was having  an abortion  in my place  that was no  I have a good one  you guys  you guys suck  when you were DJing  and you walked in  and the black light  showed the big blood 
[01:03:00]  stains on your pants  huge  and that had to go  that had to go  through her  that had to go  through her  her panties  her jeans  wow  Vinny  hey guys  how are you  good  three years ago  I was engaged  for about a month  and uh  our engagement party  we took a bunch  of rolls of film  well about five months  later I said to my  fiance  she says  oh they're just  miscellaneous  why don't you go  and develop them  so I go over to Costco  and I pay to have them done 
[01:03:30]  I pick them up  four days later  I'm with my mother  in my jeep  she says  did you see these pictures  and I said  yeah they're the  engagement party  she shows me one  with Melissa  while at the time  my fiance  laying back  in the arms  of this big  250 pound bodybuilder  black guy  and he's got both  of his hands  and I remember  the clothes she wore  that night  down the front  of her black  spandex  pants  oh man  patch  and I know  for a fact  she won a wonder  way that night  because she said  to me  oh don't make 
[01:04:00]  a big deal  about it  right  well that  that led to  a conversation  which led to her  telling her  I didn't trust her  and then she left  there you have it  I didn't trust her  there you have it  you guys got it  take care  what other situation  can you be in  where you're either  engaged or married  or something  and alright  I'm going to go  to a room  where they play  loud music  and touch somebody  of the opposite sex  in their private areas  because that's what it is  why can't you just say  hey I'm going to  I'm going to go 
[01:04:30]  into the bedroom here  play some loud music  and flashing lights  and just touch somebody  of the opposite sex  why because it's a place  called Chippendales  it makes it okay  it's okay  sure  doesn't make sense  alright we gotta  take a break  the Opie and Anthony  show  hello  can I speak for Mr. Opie  uh this is he  how you doing  my name is Gessette  and I'm calling  from  what's happening  Gessette  how you doing

[01:11:30]  yeah  and they were all  in the kiss makeup  dwarfs  I don't know  dwarfs  kiss dwarfs  kiss dwarfs  little dwarfs  little people  that's cool man  yeah they came out  with all the makeup on  and they were the lip sync  they didn't really play  oh  you know  that would have been  my god  if they played  imagine that  but it was hilarious  they walk on stage  with their little bodies  all dressed in the kiss makeup  yeah  it was a freak show  last night  I'm sitting here  feeling bad  I said midget before  I didn't realize  it was politically incorrect 
[01:12:00]  look at you  I'm trying to say  a good thing  about the kiss group  and I come right off  with the wrong terms  how do you know  and I look like midget  why is that  midget would seem okay  dwarf doesn't seem okay  dwarf's like a cartoon thing  everything gets switched  everything you say  for a while  then you can't say it anymore  yeah  but I'm always the last  to find out  and you always say  the wrong thing  yes  exactly  dwarf  dwarf now  colored oriental  midgets  you can't say that 
[01:12:30]  remember when oriental  was fine  for a long time  for a damn long time  you can't say that anymore  it's like  no oriental  is  that is an object  can be oriental  we are Asian  what  what the hell  did that happen  it's an oriental  rug rug  right  but an Asian  person  standing on the oriental rug  right  got it  Kevin's going to help  Brian Regan  with the midget dwarf thing  ah good  Kevin  yeah how you doing guys  hey Kevin  good how's it going Brian 
[01:13:00]  good  there's a technical difference  a midget  is someone under  four feet tall  who's perfectly proportioned  they have a regular size head  regular size arms  for little bodies  a dwarf is that little tiny body  with the big head  so typically  doctors differentiate  between the two  got it now  so if these little  kiss guys  had those  you know  those big heads  and those funny little legs  then they're dwarves  they're not midgets  they each got their own  different associations  there's midgets of America  there's dwarves of America  so  they don't like being confused 
[01:13:30]  got it  and the midgets  don't get along with the dwarves  apparently not  no  the dwarves get all the attention  you know  but everybody  I mean  you make fun of the dwarves more  but  the midgets  you know  they don't get enough recognition  there's this whole little war  going on  that we don't even know about  you imagine they  you know  both groups book a convention  in the same hotel  and like  they don't know about  the other group  and then  oh no  there's bad blood  in the lobby man  the midgets  and the dwarves  are  when you're a dwarf 
[01:14:00]  you're a dwarf  all the way  you call me a dwarf  I'm a midget  do I look like  I'm in proportion  yeah  do I look like  my arms and legs  are proportional  to the rest of my body  who you calling a midget here  oh boy  alright let's go to Brooks  another girl showed up  to get her pictures done  for the best ass contest  last day that the girls  could come down  oh there's a new girl 
[01:14:30]  yes  Brooks what's up  hey what's up  ONA  hey  how's it going  hey Brian  when's your next CD  coming out buddy  don't know  I don't have any  short term plans  I'm like lame  at planning my career out  everybody else has  all kinds of goals  and aspirations  I'm like  hey I never even  thought about that  maybe I should do  another one  you just go  and do your gigs  I just do the shows  I fly home  hey you ever thought  about getting on TV  you know  I see these other guys  do it  they seem to be 
[01:15:00]  making a lot of money  I gotta go out  and do something like that  no you're right  man I appreciate  hopefully you'd  want to check it out  so  you gotta write  one of those  wacky comedy books  too Brian  that's right  because we all  downloaded  I mean bought  the first CD  so we're going  to the second one  hey  Brian was that  ass better than  the one you saw  the last time  you were in the studio  oh man  every time I come  in here  it's a blast  in fact it was  like a little weird  when I came in today  because last time  we were in the studio 
[01:15:30]  there was like  a naked guy  in a swimming pool  that was on Ron and Ben  seen the rat eaters here  they had the  the hemorrhoid touch  hemorrhoid yeah  that was when we  finally got these sounds  I don't blame  ah ah  ah  oh  those sounds  Brian was here  watching the guy  administer the  preparation H  I'm a completely  different person  since I started  coming in here  you really are  man  alright Brooks  thank you  alright thanks guys  later  well Karen is the  mother of a dwarf  oh no  ah  well let's give her 
[01:16:00]  some equal time here  Karen  yes  how are you  okay  um  you know  there's an organization  called Little People of America  oh  yeah  and the politically correct term  is little person  little person  for a dwarf or a midget  no it's neither  you know  it goes back in the days  when you're referring to  wait Karen  Karen  I gotta stop you  we had kiss dwarfs  last night  they wanted to be called dwarfs  not midgets  well actually  they were called  mini kiss  weren't they  oh  they told us  kiss dwarfs  yeah they wanted to be called 
[01:16:30]  kiss dwarfs  so you're saying  that neither term  is correct  now what it is  is actually  um  because  being part of  Little People of America  was founded by  Billy Barty  who recently died  he was a dwarf  he had a different  he had cartilage hair syndrome  what's that  it's  well there's like  four different  four thousand different  kinds of um  dwarfism  well I'm not going to  memorize a name  for every one of them  well neither am I  neither am I  some of the people  you know  some of them  the most popular form  is what you guys  usually see 
[01:17:00]  is achondroplasia  you're the  you're a mother  of a dwarf  child with dwarfism  dwarfism  don't use it as a noun  when did you  when did you find that out  oh  when did I find that out  you usually find it out  either at birth  or a few months after  how was it with you  a few months after  well the pregnancy  must have been easy  well sometimes  they get diagnosed  later  you know  there's doctors  and university  hospitals  I mean your example  you gave birth  and then did you know  right away  or did you  yeah  they find out 
[01:17:30]  during the pregnancy  even before the child  was born  oh how long  during your pregnancy  did you find out  they could find out  within like  you know  six months  when they're doing  the sonogram  oh and they did  and all of a sudden  they said hey  you know  it's like this  you're going to have  a little person  or a child  with dwarfism  and you know  it's not as big  as a deal  as people make it  sound out  there's people  did they give you  the choice  pardon me  did they ask you  if you wanted to  you know  be given the choice  you know 
[01:18:00]  if after six months  well you had those options  with any kind of  any mother has that choice  no matter what it is  you know  the choice  the big A  would you never do it  no  I'm sure somebody would  if you guys visited  these people  that did many kids  last night  some of them  have families  oh no I know  no no I'm saying  they're great kids  they have kids with  we were loving  kiss dwarfs  last night  they were great  and you know  dwarf  people with dwarfism  opie  because I'm not  going to use it  as a noun  do you know  they can have 
[01:18:30]  normal sized children  yes they can  and that's got to be  a trip huh  all of a sudden  you're towering over  mom and dad  that happens all the time  how old is your  is it a boy or a girl  girl  and how old is she  six years old  yeah okay  six  wow  how about that  all right Karen  thank you  thank you  all right  that's it  a little insight  on dwarfism  there you go  opie  all right  I don't know  wouldn't you  wouldn't  all right Brian

[01:20:00]  on that line  man  everyone loves me  I want to  continue that  happy feeling  it's like every  time I say  something I gotta  like go back  what did I just  say now  you know  both shows  tonight it's  just gonna be  an hour of  corrections and  apologies  right when I  first came in  and talked about  stalker Patty  first of all  that was unkind  towards her  so I apologized  about that  then I said  midgets  followed up  with dwarves  both of them  are politically  incorrect  I apologize  again  I've got 
[01:20:30]  no time  for any jokes  goodnight  and I apologize  that I can't  do my jokes  and I'm so  sorry  no I'd say  you know  I've been  reading to  little Christopher  and you know  these books  I don't know  who's writing  children's books  I just want  a piece of  the pie  the financial  pie  these big  cardboard  clunky books  you know  and I have  them on my  lap  and it's like  the clock  and you turn  this big 
[01:21:00]  chunky page  the big clock  you turn  another page  tick tock  you turn  another page  the end  and you look  on the back  twelve bucks  I mean what  are these guys  mingling with  other authors  hey I read  your book  the clock  that is a  real page  turner  you know  I was  halfway into  war and peace  and then  somebody told  me about  this  the clock  book  I had to 
[01:21:30]  pick that  one up  and give  it a read  you guys  do books  on tape  my wife  got me  books  every once  in a while  because I  can't read  fast at all  if you got  one of those  road trips  it makes  the time  go by  sure  and I  did it  so I  could like  read  faster  you know  but  or whatever  get through  a book  faster  but the  whole point  was so I  could fit in  better at  parties  so I  would have  a little  bit of  knowledge  which I  lack  completely  now  but when  you do  books on  tape  you still  can't act  cool at  a party  people talking  about a  book  yeah  that book 
[01:22:00]  I heard  that book  that book's  a good  lesson  because the  reading thing  is just  throwing me  for a loop  man  they say  reading makes  you smarter  if that's  the case  then how  come when  you read  a book  they have  to put  the title  of the  book  on the  top of  every  single  page  does anybody  ever get  halfway  through a  book  what the  hell am I  reading  oh it's right  there at the  top  okay  forget again  oh it's right  there  that is  handy  you know  you go to

[01:26:30]  kind of two  questions for you  the first one is  i haven't been  able to find  your first  tv yet  is it in like  tower records  i don't know  if it's there  if you went to  like amazon.com  it would be  there  okay  or uh  napster  well that's true  my second question  is do you run  a website  somewhere  yeah you can  just get it  for free  if you want  you know  you can get it  on amazon.com  or if you don't  want to pay  any money  you can always  download it  on napster  it's always better 
[01:27:00]  well they do it  to our cd  actually you know  we don't even care  it gets our name  out there  when people told  me that  i was like  so flattered  you know what i  mean  like the metallica  thing i can  understand their  gripe you know  they have a point  but when i heard  that i was on  here i was like  man that's  fantastic  hey do you run  do you run  your own website  anywhere like  stupidpeople.com  or something  uh not yet  so you may have  i have i have  the domain name  that's the only 
[01:27:30]  step i do  reserve the name  you own  brianregan.com  yeah i spent  the 75 bucks  or whatever  it is to get  the name  and that's  about all  i know how  to do  it took me  like 8 months  to figure that  out  i'm gonna go  get your stuff  from napster  then  i don't think  you heard the  first part  amazon.com  that's if you  want to pay  matt seriously  tower records  usually has it  in the comedy  section  i've seen it  there many times  and borders  and borders  i never thought  to look there  it's a great cd  we play clips 
[01:28:00]  from it all the  time  here's uh  one of my  takes on  napster  that i heard  uh  it's it's an  upgrade  if you bought  vinyl many years  ago  and um  all of a sudden  they change the  format of the  music and it is  now uh  it's not uh  it's not modern  the the uh  the the record  player  so they put out  new equipment  cd players  why should i have  to then pay  again for the  same music 
[01:28:30]  that i already  bought on vinyl  so i am just  getting the  upgrade off of  napster for the  music i already  have  these are like  albums that  you've had  since the 70s  this is how  you're talking  yourself  that's how i  justify it  he doesn't want  to buy you know  the yes album  i'm also all for  food borrowing  you just walk into  someone's house  you open their  fridge and start  eating and go no  we're just sharing  i'm file sharing  in your refrigerator  food sharing  oh man so uh 
[01:29:00]  brian was telling  us a little story  about uh the  emergency room  during yeah he  was cracking us  up i had to go  myself i had like  a stomach virus  thing and uh it  was two o'clock  in the morning my  wife was watching  christopher so she  couldn't take me i  almost called an  ambulance and it's  weird like wow well  it's weird considering  calling an ambulance  for yourself you know  you always figure you  call an ambulance for  somebody else what do  you say about yourself  can you come get me  yeah i don't feel so  hot  could you do the  code blue where 
[01:29:30]  you don't stop for  nobody and just come  on in i'll be sitting  on the couch rubbing  my belly and i'm just  looking at the phone  i don't think you're  allowed to call an  ambulance for yourself  so so i drove myself  to the emergency room  which has to be a  worse option it's two  o'clock in the morning  i show up at the  entrance and they  don't have any valet  parking at the  emergency room if  there's ever a place  where they should have  a valet parking stand  you know if there's  ever a time we want to  go can you park this  because i need to  collapse immediately  but no i gotta deal 
[01:30:00]  with please take the  ticket you know and  i'm driving around this  lot hey can i park  there i think i'm gonna  die i'm dying too  okay go ahead i'll go  up a couple levels  and i say it doesn't  matter if you're driving  yourself or somebody  else if you're driving  somebody you still want  to hop out with them at  the door you're supposed  to drop somebody off  while you go park you  know okay you go in  tell them you're shot  ask them if they 
[01:30:30]  validate you you take  care of the bullet wounds  and i'll handle parking  we'll work it out 50 50  and then you know i go in  there two o'clock in the  morning i would think  that that that would be  all they need to know to  start doing stuff the fact  that you show up at a  hospital at 2 a.m  right must mean hey he's  here start sticking tubes  up his nose what else are 
[01:31:00]  you showing up for man i'm  bored i saw your lights on  and i was wondering who's  up for canasta i got a  hankering for some canasta  like you wouldn't believe  but i gotta you know check  in with the the question  they ask it kills me that  the seat they throw they  say what seems to be the  problem the seams part is so  insulting what seems to be  the problem well it seems it 
[01:31:30]  seems like every hole in my  body is exploding every  liquid imaginable that's  that's what it seems like  but you know i'm no doctor  until it gets analyzed  officially by one of your  medical staff in my own  delusional world it seems  like there ain't no moisture  left inside me  they put you in the bag in 
[01:32:00]  this room you know it's it's  like uh they do a half room  kind of thing with a curtain  down the middle with a mystery  patient on the other side  you know you just see the  silhouette over there what the  hell's the matter with that  person i'm laying there and  that person over there is  moaning you know  i'm like man they're never  gonna help me with him  moaning like that  so i gotta out moan him you  know he's like  he's cranking it up 
[01:32:30]  quit moaning we're all  hurting  it's the emergency room they  know this  you know the nurses must just be  running around holding their ears  it's got to be hell to work in  this environment  and then they come in and  nurses like uh uh she asks  how you feeling i said you  know terrible you know do you 
[01:33:00]  have like a painkiller she goes  how would you uh how would you  describe your pain what kind of  question  um otherworldly  i don't know it's hard for me to  find adjectives that can cover  this pain  she goes well how would you  rate it then how would you rate  it on a scale of one to ten with  ten being the worst pain well you  know saying two ain't gonna get  you nothing  right oh i'm a two um maybe the  high ones if you could get me a 
[01:33:30]  baby aspirin and cut it in half and  maybe a flintstone vitamin and i'll  be out of your hair i don't mean to  bother y'all with my low level flying  beneath the radar screen pain level  uh i'm ten i guess you know i was  gonna say ten but i i i backed off  because i had heard the worst pain a  human can endure i don't know if  this is true but i heard it was  getting your upper leg bone your  femur bone cracked in half oh so i  thought i better not say ten because 
[01:34:00]  i didn't get my femur bone cracked then  i'm then i was thinking what was i  worried about is it like a femur ward at  the hospital they'll hear about it and  come hobbling in my into my room who  the hell had the audacity to say they're  out of level ten you know nothing about  ten give me a sledgehammer let me show  you what ten is all about mr tommy ache  and i'm fine now it ended up i had the 
[01:34:30]  sniffles ah the sniffles the sniffles what  the hell is that after all that you know  what you get you get what we call the  sniffles you must feel like a moron at  that point hey anthony what how do we  know he's brian reagan i was just thinking  over here someone is on the line saying  they're brian reagan there you know  brian reagan's calling in what is  happening here you sure you're brian  reagan i always thought i was pop down

[01:36:00]  did real brian reagan would have had a bit i  just talked repeated what i said until i  made people angry the real brian reagan  would have said something funny i don't  have that kind of material i don't know  about that man hey this is uh frank caliendo  i would guess so how you doing frank i'm  doing all i was going to keep being used  i blew it i blew the whole illusion  how you doing me  you tore down the wall  oh my yeah it's like a you're in a play and

[01:40:30]  we're gonna blindfold one give them something sharp spin them around and let  them go go bobby with the pin just run amok  what are those noises those are puncture wounds bobby stop we made a horrible  error or you could try musical chairs there there's a nice little anxiety  attack for seven-year-olds only one kid can win all the other kids are walking  around 
[01:41:00]  elbowing other five-year-olds  how was the party it was horrible i couldn't get a chair and i got a pin in  my neck i don't want to go back to that house i got a pin in my jugular  you said that would be a happy house  you said  so those are two options yeah  that was a good setup by lexi yeah very good yeah the softball lob

[01:42:00]  starts screaming and applauding like the first time i know that was so flattering  why the hell are they applauding that much i didn't realize at the time that you guys just  pumped that up yeah and i i certainly appreciate the support but i was like thrown for a loop  because you know usually you do it and hopefully you get a little bit of a laugh i i did it that  night and it was people were like yelling don't make you want to sign i'm like what the hell is  going on here man the call phrase of the retarded it really is joke hit this nerve before in front  of a crowd yeah that was strange but people are applauding and clapping they had their lighters 
[01:42:30]  out like you started a free bird or something hey uh i got a setup for you yeah brian i i recently  learned her is that you're reading it i recently learned i recently about i recently heard that  you learned to play chess you did nice setup it's so subtle thank you i actually i got a talent for

[01:43:30]  mention this thing about chess opie because uh because i just had a hunch you know i have been  playing chess you know the thing that's weird about it it doesn't end it doesn't end right it  doesn't end like it there's no finality to it you know you're just looking at the board and  your opponent goes uh checkmate and you're like my king is still there and he's like  yeah but no matter what you do in the next move i take the king and the following move so it's a 
[01:44:00]  checkmate you know he's in the car heading home no other game lets you do that you know you never  see a quarterback coming up to the line touchdown the way your safeties are playing we'll do a slam  pass underneath the coverage too much of a cushion six points touchdown hey why don't you score to  touchdown man and then you get warned which is you don't see that in anything else either in chess  before you ever get checkmated you know your opponent just goes uh check check i'm sorry what  what did you say you're in check you're in trouble oh okay thank you i wasn't aware but now i am 
[01:44:30]  you don't see that in foot you don't see the linebackers you know just talking to the quarterback  hey uh we're blitzing what he's uh doing a safety blitz from back in there i'm sneaking in right here  between the center and a uh and the center and a guard oh okay um hey block him  thank you thank you mr linebacker i had no idea

[02:01:30]  We're laughing here  and you're just kind of  staring at us.  I'm listening to you  and enjoying.  I'm putting on an album  dice-a-live  at Budokan.  Reginald!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello?  Hi, this is Harry.  I was in your restaurant  the other day.  I got some takeout.  Yes.  And ever since,  I've been pooping green.  What?  I've been pooping green.  You've been pooping green? 
[02:02:00]  Green poopies?  Yes.  Lots and lots  of green poopies  and I went to a doctor  and he told me  to go back 48 hours  to see what I ate  and the only thing  I could think of  is the takeout  from your restaurant.  When is that?  I got takeout  Sunday afternoon.  Sunday afternoon.  And ever since,  I've been pooping green.  What did you order, sir?  Beef and broccoli.  Beef and broccoli.  And I've been pooping  green ever since.  Have you ever  dried heat  from your butt before?  No. 
[02:02:30]  Oh my God.  After all the green poop  he left,  I was still getting  the squirts  but nothing was coming out.  I think after all this  couple days,  you're the only one  complaining about  let me know  about this thing.  Well, the doctor suggested  I come down  with some of the green poopy  and maybe you could  identify it.  We could throw it  in a strainer  and maybe if you could  identify the broccoli,  things will be okay.  It's okay.  You can come down  with it.  Have you ever  pooped green?  No.  It's not fun, 
[02:03:00]  let me tell you.  Yeah, I know  something like that  that should be  pretty bad too,  you know?  Well, I got  green racing stripes  in my underwear.  Jesus Christ.  It's not fun.  Are you laughing  at me, sir?  No, I'm not.  I'm just,  I'm just,  you know.  Oh, I'm turning  into a Play-Doh  fun factory.  Jesus Christ.  Lots and lots  of green poopies.  Jesus Christ.  What, what,  what I should see.  Wait a minute,  I'm going to be,  try even for my  butt again. 
[02:03:30]  Listen to this.  Oh, see,  nothing comes out.  Yeah, but when  you go back  to the,  to the doctor again,  see what the doctor  can, uh,  can identify with,  uh, what,  what is it?  Because we,  we, we,  we not in the  medical staff,  we cannot identify  anything about those  things.  You've never heard  of green poopies  before?  No, never.  This is the first  case I can hear  about it.  Yeah.  Would you like to  hear another dry  heat from the  butt?  Uh, I think  this would be  good enough.  Uh, well, 
[02:04:00]  let me do one  more.  I'm in the  bathroom with  the cellular  phone.  Oh, did you  hear that?  Yes, I hear  you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Wow, this is

A couple phone numbers  in the New York area  877-692-1027  anywhere else  including Boston.  Boston.  We're just tuning in.  We got great news  from Boston.  We did real well  on the ratings 
[02:05:30]  up there in Boston.  We're more gooder  this time around  and want to thank  everyone up there.  More gooder.  We're supporting the show.  Rich Voss is in the studio.  Voss, what's up, man?  He looks like a proud pop-up.  I'm not a proud pop-up.  He's introducing Patrice  to Aunt Nye  and our listeners.  Patrice is a really funny guy.  I met Patrice  a few times there  at Caroline's.  Probably one of the  funniest comics out there.  He's a creep as a human.  Is he funnier than you? 
[02:06:00]  Yes.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody  who hasn't seen me  and seen Voss  they know I'm funny.  I like when Voss  is plowing through  the same old crap.  It's awful, isn't it?  He won't write.  Lenny Bruce got more  new jokes.  And he sells a CD  with the same material  that he said.  The Voss won't  even his improvs  is  Voss improvs 
[02:06:30]  yesterday's stuff.  I came up with  a couple new bits.  Go ahead.  Say one.  Give us one of your new bits.  I don't know.  Let me think of one.  Here's a new one  who really gets  on my nerves.  Jared from Subway.  I hope he gains  all his weight back.  In the text  when I'm doing it  on stage.  He lost 300 pounds  eating subs.  I go,  what was he eating  before that?  Can you tell  that he's making this?  He wrote this down.  I don't want to 
[02:07:00]  stop people from eating.  Rich Voss  has made that up  yesterday.  He wrote it down.  He's trying it here.  What he's going  to end up doing  is  basically  hey everybody  wants to go white  is  Woss  Woss  Woss  Woss  Woss  Woss  Woss  Woss 
[02:07:30]  Woss  Woss  Woss  It's new.  It's a new joke.  Buy my CD.  Is Jared even  doing those  commercials anymore?  Yeah, they show up.  I haven't seen them.  Listen,  Rich Voss  always comes out  with new stuff  all the time.  Hey, now, Mary,  did you see me  the other night  perform?  Oh, they set her up.  Yeah?  You were wonderful.  How funny was that? 
[02:08:00]  You were very funny  and he got me dinner too.  Oh, see that?  He didn't pay for it  but he got it for me.  Yeah, I hooked you up, right?  Yes.  With a salad?  Yes, you did.  All right, we're done with you.  What do you think  of our new furniture  outside the studio?  That's nice.  We're jazzing up the place.  What's that?  The vinyl or whatever  sort of spoo slides off it?  What is that crap?  I don't know.  It's like the furniture  that they brought in.  It looks like  Greg Brady's attic bedroom now.  Don't you feel like  you're on the real world  set or something?  No, I wouldn't put that 
[02:08:30]  in a summer beach house.  It's really ugly.  It really is.  I like the old stained stuff  that was in here  because you know  at least when I talk  I'm going to slobber  and I'm not going to feel guilty.  That stuff is horrible.  Who picked it out?  Patrice is just shaking  his head out.  Patrice is like  you're saying nothing.  I'm just talking.  If you see these guys  down at Caroline's  Voss will be up there  he'll be doing his act  and Patrice is sitting  like by the kitchen door  kind of pretty far away  just mocking Voss  the whole time. 
[02:09:00]  It's awful.  No, he's sitting  by the kitchen door  waiting for food.  I'm fat ladies and gentlemen.  I'm a fat joke.  Fat.  People can't see  on the radio Voss  but I'm a fat guy  so I'm a fat guy.  You are a buffet molester.  You're not fat.  Jesus Christ.  You're fat.  Stop insulting me.  It's the year 2006 Rich.  His jokes are old.  His car is old.  Yeah, I heard about this car.  Does anybody know this car?  He's making payments  on an 89 Mercedes. 
[02:09:30]  Wait, but here's the thing.  You're making payments?  No.  He got the janitors  like the rich janitor  bins.  It's not even like  it's the bins they make  for people that  but that's Voss.  You ever see him?  Voss, your shirt's dirty.  It's DKNY.  Voss, but it's filthy.  I can't even fight that.  But it's DKNY.  Voss, this car stinks. 
[02:10:00]  It's 1982.  You're trash machines.  It's a Mercedes.  You're paying for this?  You're making payments?  Did he tell you  he's making payments?  Wait, wait.  Did I tell you  what the number was?  Did I tell you  what the number was?  No, it was a 190E.  That's a 190E.  Look, it's a clean  looking Mercedes.  It's a...  Nobody has a 190E.  I've never even heard of that.  You're a big black man. 
[02:10:30]  You're driving a Cadillac.  I'm supposed to.  You're a Jew.  You're driving a Mercedes.  That's only because...  That's only because you couldn't get it.  At least I'm...  That's only because you couldn't get it.  You're driving a Nazi car  and not even a good one.  You're driving a bad Nazi car.  You suck.  Oh, man.  Here's what Rich...  This is what he thought.  This is what he thought  when he came up here.  Just real quick.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to hog this.  No, hell no.  This is what he thought.  Yeah.  He says...  He's thinking...  Enough with a slobber.  That's what I'm trying to... 
[02:11:00]  Tell people to distinguish  she's talking about you  instead of just talking.  This is what he thought.  He thought, hey, I'm...  Because him and Norton,  for some reason,  they think they're good fellas now.  For some reason.  They want to pay for meals now.  They point at you  when they talk.  Hey, hey.  Oh, really?  Everybody's Italian.  Even at Chinese restaurants.  Hey, oh, hey there.  Hi, yeah.  And this is what he thought.  He thinks he's a made man.  He's going to bring me up  an Opie and Anthony show  and make a complete  jag-ass out of me  because he's a regular guest.  He's going to stop  on in, everybody. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, Patrice,  this is a pinball machine  that's broke.  Hey, Secretarius.  Hey, everybody.  Like he's bringing me  through the back entrance  and the good fella's like...  He thinks he's Ray Liotta now.  He sucks.  He's using you  just to get air time.  You know that, right?  That's what he did.  Because we would never  have him on.  Did he tell you  he is a regular guest?  The regular guest, though,  that everyone goofs on.  He stinks.  This is what he thought.  He said, okay,  I'm going to bring on  some new guys. 
[02:12:00]  But you didn't realize  they can't see fat  over the radio, bro.  But they can hear shit.  Boss, you notice how  you were whisked  right into the studio  as soon as you got here?  Yeah.  I didn't get it back.  Think about it.  Oh, okay.  Boss kills when he has  someone to goof on  in this studio.  No, listen,  I never fail for you guys.  We're all team players.  I didn't bring him up here  thinking, hey,  I'm going to crack on you.  I don't care about you.  No, I didn't.  What am I going to say  possibly about you?  No.  You absolutely did, Boss.  I don't like how you  try to use me  like I'm the new kid  at Reese's. 
[02:12:30]  No.  Not at all.  They call me and say,  you know, whatever.  We've been trying to get you  on the show for a while,  Patrice.  That is the truth.  Listen, if your phone  was turned on  and they could have  called you,  then you would have  known that.  There you go.  Black people's phones  ain't turned on.  No, yours are.  Yours isn't, okay?  See, and whenever I  come back to you,  you're going to go  the whole black people  thing, you know?  It's you.  You.  It has nothing to do  with black people.  Do you like his  black humor there,  Patrice?  It's, I mean,  yeah.  The wallet joke  and the fried chicken,  the coochie fried. 
[02:13:00]  Every black comic  on earth talks  about white people.  Not really.  I don't.  Who?  Yes, you do.  You don't talk  about white people?  No.  No?  I can say about  ten of them.  When I'm walking  down the street,  some white lady's  walking at me  and I'm thinking,  you know,  or I'm scared.  That's reflective  on me.  You're talking  about white people.  On what I think.  I'm not saying  white people's phones  work, black people's  don't.  Well, I'm generalizing.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you saying?  Okay, okay.  White people,  white people.  Well, no,  you don't do that.  White people talk  like,  white ladies fall 
[02:13:30]  at the monster movie.  That's what I do.  No, you don't do that.  You don't do that  like white people  are crazy,  white people pay taxes.  You don't do that.  I get nervous.  White people support  their kids.  You don't do that  kind of stuff.  Well, I don't remember  what I do  because I'm moving  on to new material.  They get up early  for what?  White people,  they crazy.  You don't do  that kind of stuff.  White people,  they crazy.  They see their kids  once or twice a year.  No, see,  you do the regular stuff  about white people.  White people crazy.  That's not me.  They got bank accounts. 
[02:14:00]  Now he's making up stuff.  White people crazy.  Ladies and gentlemen,  that's not on his CD.  They like girls  with small asses.  All that stuff  is not on his CD.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Stop using me  as a black guinea pig.  I don't like that.  I'm not.  I'm just saying,  you talk about white people.  Voss,  say one of my jokes.  I try not to remember  your act.  Say one of my jokes.  Listen,  you do the one about  if a white lady gets killed,  you don't want to be blamed for it.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  Yes.  That's white.  That's very funny.  How about if a lady gets killed,  you don't want to be blamed for it.  Why has it got to be a white lady?  Of course,  if a white lady is killed  in real life,  you're going to look at black people.  It's funny when I say white lady,  Voss.  But it's funny when I say black people.  No,  it's not.  Yes,  it is.  It is.  They feel bad for you,  Rich.  No.  Okay.  Oh,  God.  Wait,  wait.  When we're doing,  okay,  here's the deal.  22 years in the business.  Listen to me.  A rule for all black comics. 
[02:15:00]  I mean,  all black audience.  Yeah.  Right?  You're on stage,  Armand.  Who's going to do better?  Me.  Yeah?  Let's get your old Apollo tape.  Let's get your Apollo tape.  I got booed once.  You got booed 17 times  and you think black people love you.  No.  They hate you like white people,  like Jews.  No one likes you.  What happened at the Apollo?  I got booed right off.  How did that happen?  You got booed at the Apollo?  I came out there nice and arrogant.  You know,  I didn't come out there.  What's up?  What's up?  I just went up there  and I expected the same reaction 
[02:15:30]  that I'd get at Caroline's.  Nothing.  You know what you got to come out  for the Apollo?  You come out in an Asian guy mask  and they will love you.  I have seen,  I've watched  every goddamn episode  of Showtime at the Apollo  and they love,  when the Asian,  like,  they could do 80s break dancing.  They could do 80s break dancing.  They got like,  and we got this Japanese troop  over there  that don't speak a word of English.  They go,  and the music starts,  the whole crowd goes,  they go crazy.  And if they sing gospel, 
[02:16:00]  that's even heaven.  Oh, yeah.  A Chinese guy  singing gospel on his phone.  Oh, yeah.  Forget it.  He's 20 weeks in a row.  He's winning.  I got booed right off.  Really?  Too arrogant, you think?  Yeah,  I came out nice and  like I was funny.  Yeah.  I got a big fat lesson.  They're not going to show it though  because I curse.  I may show up.  Do you got to show up?  I never made a name.  Show this.  That's smart.  Yeah,  they look smart.  Hey,  Elisa from Cleveland  has a problem today.  Elisa,  what's up?  Oh, 
[02:16:30]  bummer.  It says,  on her period,  but wants sex,  even just oral,  boyfriend won't,  what to do,  what to do.  Elisa,  we lose you?  No.  So now,  you're having your time.  Is that okay?  And your boyfriend  doesn't touch you  when you're doing this?  Yeah,  I don't know what his time is.  He doesn't want to get freaky  or anything.  You know,  it's like,  I'm on my rag  and I've been on my rag  for months.  See,  I started taking my birth control.  Maybe it's the way you put it.  No.  Okay,  look,  well,  hey.  I'm on my rag.  For months,  maybe you're a kid.  Hey,  same thing.  And see,  I haven't had any sex 
[02:17:00]  because he doesn't want  to do anything  and it's pissing me off.  He doesn't want to do anything  crime scene sex.  Crime scene sex  is perfectly acceptable.  Just do it on,  um,  You guys into the crime scene sex?  Darker sheets.  No,  no.  You don't do that?  No?  I don't mind committing a crime  against sex,  but I'm not as a crime.  You won't,  uh,  I make my girl sleep on the floor  when she's on a period.  Really?  What?  I don't even touch her.  Nasty.  Stinking.  Pretty ugly now.  It's bleeding. 
[02:17:30]  You should be willing  to touch her  no matter what  that's your girl.  Wow.  She only bleeds  for four days.  On the floor.  Okay,  I'm not happening  to do something  every night.  A month of bleeding  from that mess.  I don't even know  if that made the error.  That's hilarious.  God damn.  Yeah,  I don't,  you know something?  I got no problem.  The guy should have,  he should dive right in there.  Yeah,  there's no gray area  with that one,  man.  You should grow it.  You're either into it  or not.  What should I say to him?  Say F me  or I'll find someone 
[02:18:00]  that will.  I'll get him going.  I can't do that.  I've been with this guy  for like two years.  It's all kinds of stuff.  Yeah,  it's eggs and...  It's like a puree.  It's cleansing.  If he was just bleeding  like it was a wound,  it would be different.  Yeah,  but I'm saying,  see,  and I'm almost off  and it's not even  all that bad anymore.  So where did Jay or Jay?  It's like,  it's almost done  and he still won't do anything.  It's been like two weeks  since he's touched me  and it's like...  Maybe he just doesn't  want to have sex with you.  What do you want?  Hey,  watch that language.  Hey, 
[02:18:30]  watch that language.  What do you look like?  What do I look like?  Yeah,  long blonde hair,  two eyes.  Yeah?  What else do you want to know?  On a one to ten,  what are you?  Huh?  On a one to ten scale,  what are you?  And you've got to be an eight.  On a personal opinion?  Yeah.  No,  from the guy down the block.  Yeah,  personal opinion.  I'll give myself an eight.  I'll be in Cleveland next week.  Well,  if it's,  if it's,  like Patrice said,  if it's looked like  a regular wound blood,  if it's like, 
[02:19:00]  what,  like ragu marinara,  you don't want to,  no,  nothing even near there.  If it was that bad,  I wouldn't ask him to do anything.  Looks like cacciatore.  Chunks of peppers and onions.  I'll have fun stuff also.  Sure.  Looks like salsa.  Well,  maybe he's got a point now  that I think about it.  All right,  Elizabeth,  I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah,  we can't help you today.  You're either,  you're either into it or not.  All right, 
[02:19:30]  thanks anyway,  you guys.  All right.  Big Al,  you no get period for a month.  She's dying.  He's making a quick diagnosis.  She's dying.  She's dying.  I don't know.  Jimmy,  you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Yeah,  hey boss.  What's up?  And the words from Jim Norton,  you stink.  Thank you.  All right,  thanks.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I've got big plans for my future.  A good college, 
[02:20:00]  a career,  maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on  is getting pregnant.  That's why I choose anal.  I mean,  sure,  it hurts a little  and I wind up walking funny  for a day or two,  but I think my future's worth it.  Anal.  The smart choice  for your future.  All right,  this is a song that,  uh,  I think it's going to replace  a certain other song.  Okay.  that I,  we know and love,  but,  uh,  I don't get a chance  to play it very often. 
[02:20:30]  Oh,  the Special Olympics song?  Maybe that's it.  Okay.  I don't know.  So,  I kind of wrote a different version  of that song.  So don't call in  and tell me  that I'm ripping myself off.  Because I already know it,  all right?  This is about a childhood friend  named,  uh,  named Ed.  Ed.  Don't touch those buttons either.  I see you looking at them. 
[02:21:00]  When I was a boy of ten,  I had a very best friend.  Ed was kind,  with good intent,  but just a little different,  oh,  special end. 
[02:21:30]  Mama dropped him on his hand.  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  We'd play tag,  and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier,  he'd eat dirt. 
[02:22:00]  I like math,  and a spelling bee.  Ed liked talking to a tree,  oh,  special end.  Mama dropped him on his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed.  Cause he's a little bit special.  A little bit special. 
[02:22:30]  I ran track,  hung out in malls.  Ed ran head first into walls.  I had girls,  and lots of clothes.  Ed had names for all his toes.  So special end.  Mama dropped him on his head. 
[02:23:00]  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  He's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  One day talking to special end.  He grabbed a brick,  and he swung in my head.  And as he laughed at me,  that's when I knew  special end just made me special too. 
[02:23:30]  Now I laugh  As I count bugs  I give strangers  Great big hugs  Next to me  It is fine  He's a  A f***ing Einstein  Oh,  Special end in me 
[02:24:00]  Now we're not right  In the head  You see  Now we're not so  Bright  Instead  We're a little bit special  Just a little bit special  That bastard Ed  Made me special  Just a little bit special

[02:27:00]  She packed my sister's lunch  And my sister comes home  Crying from school  She was sent home  She went to Catholic school  My mom had packed her lunch  And you know how you would  Wrap up sodas in tinfoil  Yeah  Wrapped up a can of beer  By accident  My sister got sent home  From school  Rock  That's a cool mom  Like peanut butter and jelly  And bud  I never had  I never had the cool lunch  No  I was always the guy  Trying to upgrade my lunch  With my pals  Really 
[02:27:30]  Oh yeah  I never wanted to do that  Because I was skeeved out  By anyone else's  Like mom's hands  Touching the food  That it was  You want to trade this sandwich  I'm like oh  You're skeevy mom's hands  All over this thing  Get out of here  I get like a  You know  A bruised apple  For snack  And my buds  Would have like  Homemade chocolate chip cookies  Or homemade brownies  I'm like come on man  Trade  And I never  I know the horror  You went through  With the school lunch  But  Especially with the bag  I never wanted  The brown bag  I never wanted 
[02:28:00]  The little brown bag  I wanted  A lunch box  And every year  Damn it  I got a lunch box  I had my  Lost in space lunch box  You know  One of my brothers  Should call up  With the thermos  But I remember  Because you're hitting  A real soft spot  In my family  You should just hear  What Opie had to go  To school with  For his lunch  The bags  We were so poor  Yeah you're poor  Opie  We were so poor  I'll tell you the story  Yeah like Anthony said 
[02:28:30]  Everyone  Think how embarrassing  This is  It's the big king  Caller back  I'll tell the story  You ass  I'm the big king  Caller back  If my brother calls  He'll  That's great  How embarrassing  He would be suicidal  To tell the story  On the air  But basically  Like Ant said  You know  All your friends  Had the cool lunch boxes  Maybe like  I don't know  The Brady Bunch  Lunch box  Or the Scooby Doo  Lunch box  Yeah  Open it up  You got your little  Thermos in there  For your little  Fruit cup or something 
[02:29:00]  Right  And your drink  And your sandwich  All nice and wrapped  Sure  And then if you didn't  Have the lunch box  Or you didn't want one  You could go to the store  And buy the little lunch bags  No no  I'll explain  The lunch box  Were given to the kids  Whose moms really cared  Right  Then you had the kids  That came in  Like you said  With the small  Brown lunch bag  You could go to the store  And buy a big  Stack of those  Right  Oh no  It cost too much money  To get the small  Brown paper bags  For my lunch  See we were so poor 
[02:29:30]  Like Rick  Rick guessed  About two minutes ago  My god damn lunch  A lousy peanut butter  And jelly sandwich  And a bruised apple  Were  That's it  It was just like  Two little things  Were in a  Huge  Huge  Huge  Wall bombs  Paper bag  The one they pack  The groceries in  And then what was  What was your 
[02:30:00]  What was your carrying style  Would you carry the whole thing  Or roll it  So it's just like  The big bottom of the bag  And this huge  Rolled up  It gets worse  It gets worse  We brought the bags  Home  Home  Home after lunch  You had to fold them up  And bring them  Home  Oh that's pretty bad man  So we could put  The book covers  On our textbooks  You made them 
[02:30:30]  Out of the paper bags  Yeah  So like my science textbook  Had a big huge  Wall bombs  On the front  While my friends  Had the cool  Star Trek book covers  So they were  Dual purpose  Anthony  They were used  To  To carry  My lousy  Sandwich  And bruised apple  To school  And then we had  To bring them home  So we could make  Book covers  Did it have your name  Written on it too  Oh fate 
[02:31:00]  Cause then  Cause then when you  Leave that  With your coat  Over  You know  You have your whole  Thing set up  Yeah where you  Everybody knows  It's your bag  If your name's on it  Oh the big  Shopping bag  I knew my brother  Would call  He's a bitter man  Elmo  Hey  What's up man  Is this a nightmare  Or what  Why are you  Bringing this up  You know  It gets dark  At four o'clock  I'm already suicidal  And you have to  Bring that up  I mean 
[02:31:30]  We would take  These huge  Like King Cullen  Bags  And roll the top  Down  And fold them  And do whatever  We could  To try to mimic  Those small  Little bags  So we looked  Normal  But once  I also got  A cement bag  From dad  Wait a minute  One of those  Huge cement bags  We were done  Doing the  Sidewalks  Around the house  Like a  Sacrete bag  Yeah  One of those  Huge bags  You know  Because my dad  Still had powder  In it  So we put 
[02:32:00]  Put the food in that  And rolled it up  I'm like  You gotta be kidding me  It was unbelievable  Trust me  My brother says it  It happened  It happened  I'm dying for you  A cement bag  This is like  The shame  Of our family  I still can't  Go shopping  And get a  Get a paper  I always have  To go plastic  Just to  Erase the memory  Elmo you notice  How like  Ant's telling  All his horror stories  From growing up  And I'm keeping  My mouth shut  I know  I'm like  Oh my god 
[02:32:30]  That's like  Going to a spa  I'm like  I'm just  Biting my lip  Because I don't  Want to have  A nervous breakdown  Live on the air  Come on  Unload  It'll make you  Feel better  Tell Anthony  About the  Sugar and margarine  Sandwiches  At grandma's house  Oh a delicacy  Why do they  Feed the kids  I'm diabetic now  I wonder why  Oh my god  He is too  What  What did they do  Well my grandma  Had a beach house 
[02:33:00]  Out there in  Waiting River  And  That sounds pretty fancy  Bouncing  It was a nice  It was great  It was a great  Little house  Great  And  I don't know  She had about  What  40 grandkids  Elms  At least  So she would  Just break out  A loaf of  Wonder bread  Just  On the table  Quick margarine  All the way down  She'd bake like  20 sandwiches  At a time  And then just  Pour sugar  On the  On the  On the  And give it  To kids  And give it 
[02:33:30]  To us  And give it  To kids  Yeah  Like they weren't  Wired enough  And then we  Bounce around  Bing  Bing  Bing  And we'd go  Outside to get  Fried by the sun  Because we didn't  We didn't wear  Sunscreen  Wait a minute  They wouldn't put  Sunscreen on you  Tell the whole story  Man  Come on  Kids on crank  Getting burnt  Yeah  All right  Number one  We'd go swimming  In the ocean  Without any kind  Of supervision  When we're like  Three  We'd have no  Suntan motion  We'd be eating  Sugar  I mean  It was just  Too sad  And then  Then we would 
[02:34:00]  Be so burnt  From the sun  That we couldn't  Move right  Right  And what did  We have to sleep  In at night  The army blankets  With the sand  It was like  It was like  Reclining on sandpaper  Those old  Army blankets  The real rough ones  Yeah  Those dark green blankets  And we used to make  Tints out of them  And we're talking  We were so sunburned  Like our eyelids  Were red  And like  Our underarms  Were red  And we'd have to sleep  On top of sand  And then we'd have to sleep 
[02:34:30]  In these army cots  With an army blanket  We might as well  Have been sleeping  You know  On insulation  Because it was  The same feeling  Between the army blanket  And the sand  That happened to be there  From the last person  That slept in the army cup  And it wasn't sand  And it was full of sugar  Which has the same effect  Oh my god  That's some upbringing  It was great  Yeah  It was great  All I wanted was  Like the lousy 
[02:35:00]  Little brown  Lunch  Lunch bag  Bag  Little sandwich  I know  I practically have to  Like stick people up  Not for the lunch money  But for their lunch bag  Give me the bag  The last thing you wanted  To do going to school  Was look different  Exactly  Swear to god  You just wanted  A conformed fit in  So no one would  Give you crap  Because the second  You try to do  Something different  You're marked  An outcast  Oh sweet  And if you're  The big lunch bag guy  People are calling you  The big lunch bag guy 
[02:35:30]  The cement lunch bag guy  Is even worse  That's the truth  But in the winter  Like I wouldn't wear  My jacket  Because I'd use it  To camouflage the huge lunch bag  So now I go home  With a cold  It's just  A nightmare  It was  It was interesting  All I wanted  Was a sandwich  Remember the kid in school  In the cafeteria  That might as well  Have been the drug dealer  He came in  With the little plastic baggie  Of chocolate  For the chocolate milk  It was like this  Powder stuff 
[02:36:00]  And everyone would gather around  Man put a little in my milk  Man put a little in  But what you got man  What do you have for me  I'm the chocolate man  Here we go kids  I got chocolate  And like his buddies  Would all you know  Just I keep a little  For my head  And then I get rid  Of the rest  Oh my god  The chocolate milk kid  Like rule  I never got the chocolate milk  You kidding me  I remember that  And he would  Like dole it out  To his buddies  So that the milk  Just  It was still like  The color of milk 
[02:36:30]  Just vaguely brown  Like yeah  We're drinking chocolate milk  And you suck  Wow  I do suck  I tried to trade  The bruised apple  Or the bruised pear  For that  But it never worked  For some reason  I mean  Why weren't fruit  Was a very low commodity  On the ladder  Elms  When we were growing up  Why were our apples  So damn bruised  Because they had  So much room  To bounce around  In those  All right Elms  All right  I'm going to go  Slip my wrist now
