<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began unexpectedly live, with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in off-air banter about technical difficulties before transitioning into a discussion about the Boston Marathon bombing manhunt.  They detailed the events, including graphic descriptions of the brothers' actions and injuries, the extensive police presence in Watertown, and the subsequent searches of homes.  The ensuing conversation explored the legal and ethical implications of these searches, focusing on the Fourth Amendment and the balance between public safety and individual rights.  Callers participated, offering diverse perspectives and fueling the debate.  One caller, Scott, a friend of slain MIT police officer Sean Collier, shared firsthand accounts of the tragedy and the community's reaction to the manhunt.  The discussion also encompassed stop and frisk policies, government overreach, and criticism of the media's coverage, specifically citing George Stephanopoulos's interruption of an interview with the bombers' uncle and the selective use of bleeps.  Clips from interviews with the bombers' uncle and father were played, highlighting their emotional responses. The segment also revealed that a fan posing online as a "self-cutting girl" was actually a 39-year-old man from Georgia, discovered by a Twitter user.  Nicole, present in the studio, was noted as being in a foul mood, almost physically confronting Opie.

The show continued with a discussion of the "self-cutting girl" catfish, highlighting the widespread deception online and the hosts' encounters with creepy individuals. This led to a discussion of a viral video of a North Dakota news anchor, Dan, who made several on-air blunders, including uttering "gay fucking shit" into his live mic before the broadcast.  His apology and subsequent suspension were discussed.  The broadcast then shifted to the DUI arrests of Ryan Lochte and Al Michaels, featuring a comedic clip of Lochte's interview with a Philadelphia news team.  One host’s 11-day alcohol abstention for weight loss was also mentioned, along with the death of Chrissy Amphlett.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to an interview with filmmaker Chris Columbus.  After discussing hangovers and mutual dislike, and Opie mentioning his backyard velociraptor, the conversation shifted to Columbus' career, encompassing *Gremlins*, *Reckless*, *Only the Lonely*, *Adventures in Babysitting*, *Home Alone*, and *Mrs. Doubtfire*.  He discussed the challenges of working with Robin Williams and his decision not to direct all the *Harry Potter* films.  He also promoted his novel, *House of Secrets*, and discussed his influences, working style, and future projects. The interview concluded with a brief discussion of the show's "Worst of the Week" segment.

The final segments covered Sam Roberts' departure from the Opie and Anthony countdown, further mockery of the North Dakota news anchor, a caller's conspiracy theory about a Boston police shooting, requests for Opie's Sudoku puzzle, and an advertisement for Steven Singer Jewelers.  Anthony Cumia’s 11-day sobriety and his relationships with other show personnel were speculated on.  The show concluded with an extended discussion on soda preferences, featuring various brands, and the recurring "Slavo" caller.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts and callers utilized profanity and crude humor extensively.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio, Antonio, New York City, 6 a.m., an out of control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans at the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me. I work here.  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is he happening? 
[00:00:30]  This is it.  The free men make up the Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level. 
[00:01:00]  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're just chit-chatting. 
[00:01:30]  We're having a fucking...  E-Rock starts the show without even a hint that we're on.  Did you see that we didn't have headphones on?  Yeah, and we're talking to each other.  How long has the Rage music been on?  Maybe five seconds.  Give it...  We're just chit-chatting. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, E-Rock.  How about a heads up, like, Sam, the show's about to begin and I notice they're chit-chatting.  I don't know if we're going a little late.  Yeah.  Anyway, good morning.  Hi, everyone.  We just had a nice little casual chit-chat.  I was wrapping up the Tom Sizemore situation.  Yes.  Yeah.  From Friday.  Wow.  This is just a horrible way to start a Monday show. 
[00:02:30]  I won't play it on the air, but I was going to play it for you.  E-Rock, what was going through your head?  Oh, boy.  We had no idea that you were starting the show.  Visions of Sugar Plumps.  Did you notice that?  All right, it is the normal starting time, but no one had their headphones on.  It was obvious we were kind of just chit-chatting, kind of catching up on each other and what  went on, you know, during the weekend or the last time we were on the air together.  Well, usually you have the audio on in there, so I didn't know. 
[00:03:00]  Sam, why are you laughing?  Because you guys didn't know the show was already on.  We were all just talking.  We were just yapping.  Just casually and casually and then you turned up the thing just to see where we were at.  Yeah, I was assuming.  I was expecting to hear like the end.  Ecstasy of gold or something.  And then I'm like, usually we hear ecstasy of gold and then we start getting our shit  together.  Like, all right, it's time to focus and, you know, get started here.  You listen to the cable, you know, the news on the TVs, and then you bring it down and 
[00:03:30]  just see where the audio is.  And wow, you know, ecstasy is not playing yet.  We still got a little time.  We got five news stations.  So what we do is we listen to the audio just to kind of see what these knuckles.  And then we pop to our feed.  And usually it's around the time ecstasy of gold's playing.  We're like, okay, time to settle in.  But this time we're just chit-chatting.  Generally, you just, you know, you kind of, because E-Roc can hear what we're saying even  when the mics are off.  Right.  Whatever.  And you just go. 
[00:04:00]  It's fine.  It's just fine.  Hey, guys.  It's fine.  Everything's fine.  Show us about the start.  It's fine.  No.  E-Roc comment?  No, whatever.  He's going to have no comments.  It's fine.  Everything's fine.  It's Monday.  A little slow start, maybe.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  Crimin-y.  How is Baldy more, Jim Norton?  It's fast becoming one of my favorite clubs.  Ooh. 
[00:04:30]  Magoobies is amazing.  Magoobies.  Why is it such a great club?  I don't know.  It's just the energy there is great.  They run it well.  They're on time with everything.  It's a great club.  Like, I really, really loved my shows there.  Even better than Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory?  Well, not.  Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory?  Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory.  I'll let you know after Memorial Day.  If I draw there, then Vinnie Brand's is better.  If not, then Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory is worse.  Stress Factory.  You missed an action-packed Friday show.  My God.  I know.  I heard.  All shit was going down as we started our broadcast. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, I was having a good time doing a very fun fucking bunch of phoners.  You know, that's always fun to do when you've got to do fucking seven phoners in a row.  Right.  Promote the special area on Comedy Central.  It's really easy to keep it fresh and spontaneous.  Holy shit.  Is that an awkward news morning?  Really?  Seven in a row.  Yeah, just when you go on those radio lines.  We did one of those one time.  It's just fucking weird.  And you realize that some people are really excited to talk to you, and then others were  forced to talk to you, which makes for a wonderful conversation. 
[00:05:30]  I'm just not...  Remember that, Ann?  Yeah.  We had to talk to all these newspapers, and you had a few that were like, oh my God.  And then others were like, all right, well, can we get this on?  We don't want to waste your time, and we don't want to waste our hours.  And we're...  Yeah.  I'm just not good on the phone.  No?  Bill Burr's great.  I told Bill, I texted him, I don't know how you're so good on the phone.  Bill is really good, yeah.  I fucking stink on the phone.  I just do.  Even calling this show, where I'm very comfortable, I'm just not good on the phone.  Or impersonal.  It is very difficult to do a phoner. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  You feel all good about yourself.  Well, last we left you, all shit was going down in Boston, and we thought we were going to  have it all tied up nice before we got off the air Friday, unfortunately, that wasn't  the case.  We were getting there.  We were getting there.  Yeah.  And then the kid ended up in the boat, and then we...  What was that?  Some infrared shit.  Well, they had some fucking, like, heat fucking...  Yeah, heat-seeking, seeking, actually. 
[00:06:30]  Heat-seeking camera shit from a helicopter.  Yeah.  It's like fucking...  And they obviously weren't.  Forward-looking infrared.  And then they hit him with some flashbangs.  And now they're saying he tried to kill himself.  That's a self-inflicted fucking gunshot wound to the throat.  To the throat?  It's like a dumb fucking thing to do.  Well, was he going like this?  I don't know.  Maybe, yeah, maybe that.  The famous gun...  Under the jaw.  Yeah.  Oh, I hope he shot his fucking mouth out. 
[00:07:00]  He shot his throat out, and he can't talk.  Really?  But he's conscious enough where he's writing shit down for the cops now.  Oh, good.  Did he really shoot his throat out?  Yeah.  That's what they're saying.  He'll never talk again?  Yeah, it seems to be...  Not looking good.  Great.  It's definitely not looking good.  Not looking good.  This fucking animal.  This fucking animal.  That's crazy.  Well, some people are like, he's just a kid.  I can't believe, you know, the military and thousands of police officers are chasing just a kid.  Michael Moore said that, actually.  Michael Moore said...  A few other people are saying that, too, man.  Michael Moore was like, oh, all this in the city just for a teenage boy? 
[00:07:30]  It's like, teenage boy, fucking...  He's an asshole.  He has bombs and shit.  Does he understand all the people that are missing limbs today?  I'm sure if it was a right-wing radical, he'd have a different opinion.  And they killed a cop.  They're fucking...  They were just...  And by the way...  Just for a kid, they were throwing explosives out the car.  I mean, this was a real-life GTA, as we all kind of referenced.  And he fucking...  His brother was 26, and they're calling him kids. 
[00:08:00]  And Ann Coulter pointed this out.  And that was McVeigh's age.  Yeah, yeah.  Nobody was calling McVeigh a boy.  Boy, a child.  These boys, this young man.  Mm.  Yeah, they love that boy-child thing.  I don't think you're a boy anymore after you do what they did.  No.  You're 19.  You're 19 or 40.  You're the same.  You're the same.  I don't give a fuck.  Man, that's crazy.  Yeah, that boat fucking sequence.  They obviously wanted to get him alive, because they had him.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They had him, so they were like, all right, we're going to get this one alive. 
[00:08:30]  And then supposedly he, you know, shot his own throat.  Oh, that's crazy.  He could have lit that fucking boat up.  That's what they're saying.  Who knows?  We'll find out more as it moves forward.  I hope he maimed himself and he can never eat properly again.  And he killed his own brother by running over, my hope.  He ran over his brother.  Dude, we had an eyewitness to that on the show Friday.  Yeah, yeah, a guy was out of his mind, like, telling us the story.  Yeah.  Saw the whole thing go down.  Basically, this kid, you know, ran his brother over and went right through a roadblock or whatever. 
[00:09:00]  Ran him over.  Police barricade, whatever the fuck.  Yeah, because apparently they had gotten the brother.  They had fucking captured him, cuffed him, like he was all fucking ready to be arrested.  And then here comes the younger brother zipping by, the cops jump out of the way, and he plows over his fucking own brother.  Oh, is that what happened?  Oh, yeah, that's what happened.  It's crazy.  I hope one of the charges is vehicular manslaughter.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  A little insult to injury.  They had an injury.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, they had him.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I love this.  He's the bungler.  Yes.  I love this fucking bungler.  He's bungled everything.  He accidentally kills his brother and then fails at killing himself.  This kid's the best.  Yeah.  Oh, what a fucking dummy.  Yeah, they had the brother and then the 19-year-old wanted to get the fuck away.  Yep.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, that's great.  What a fucked up whole situation.  It played out like an action movie. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  It had the beginning, the middle, the end.  It really played out like these stories never really play out.  Right.  Like they're supposed to, like everyone expects them to when things happen, but it never really ends right.  According to Alex Jones, this is exactly how it's supposed to play out.  Well, it's obviously, it's been scripted.  It's been scripted.  This is a government plot to see how martial law will impact citizens and how willing they'll be to just throw their rights away.  It's great. 
[00:10:30]  And I'm not totally off that yet.  Oh, really?  I kind of...  There's something disturbing about it.  People didn't understand my 140 characters times 800 when I was tweeting trying to explain what I meant by saying I felt uncomfortable.  There was something uncomfortable about people cheering the police after this was done when they had completely locked the city down. 
[00:11:00]  They had entered people's houses.  And by some accounts from some of these videos, not voluntarily, you know, people didn't volunteer it.  A huge, not just, you know, Joe Forrester swinging his billy club down the sidewalk, a paramilitary force entered Watertown with full armored personnel vehicles and took over the town.  Locked it down, imposed their will on the people, and the people loved it. 
[00:11:30]  They loved it.  You know why?  Because most people's lives are kind of boring.  That's some cool shit to see all of a sudden in your neighborhood.  You're absolutely right.  I mean, it's not cool for the people that were kind of, you know, yanked from their homes and stuff.  I don't know what other recourse the cops had.  I don't blame the cops because they're trained to do something, and that is what they were trained to do. 
[00:12:00]  And I'm not sure I'd blame anybody.  I don't know what the other solution would have been.  But there was something weird about this force entering a town, locking it down, imposing a microcosm of martial law, and the people loving it.  As long as it doesn't go down every weekend, I'm fine with it.  I mean, we're not going to be perfect.  If we have one of these every once in a while, what are you going to do? 
[00:12:30]  What are you going to do?  Make it good to you.  You know, I mean, there was a sticky situation in Watertown.  It's a very difficult situation.  Everybody knew why they were doing it.  It's a difficult situation.  It's a very difficult situation.  Yeah, but some of the video now coming out, oh, my God, impressive.  And, you know, a lot of the stuff went around over the weekend.  My favorite was the picture the guy took from the second window as an automatic.  I wasn't buying that picture either.  Oh, you thought it was fake? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, the guy wasn't wearing a helmet.  Everyone else had helmets on.  How was that set up?  Photoshopped?  I think he could have shopped the guy right in the fucking vehicle or shopped the entire vehicle right onto the street.  I'm not sure.  Because that one's been going around.  It has been going around, but there are a lot of fakes.  Well, show me one fake that's been going around.  We thought the picture of suspect number two running away from the scene was a fake.  And it turns out that was not a fake picture.  That wasn't a fake, right. 
[00:13:30]  I don't know.  It just something about it seemed like he didn't have his helmet on, which was weird.  No one else was paying attention to any other part of that street.  Like he's the only guy drawn up on that window.  And all the other cops in the area were just kind of.  And I know they used MPs, military police, at Fenway at some point. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  But I don't know.  Were the military police actually involved in the manhunt?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Or was that just the police?  Because that was a military police Humvee that was there.  So I don't know.  I think it was real.  I'm going to go with real.  You think it was real?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  I just was a little suspect.  I think the pictures were so amazing that you didn't really have to Photoshop anything.  Yeah, it's true.  You had an army just kind of towing around Watertown for a day and a half. 
[00:14:30]  That's what you needed to do.  That's exactly how you get this guy.  That's exactly how you keep this piece of shit from slipping out of the country and slipping away.  That's why people didn't get mad because they knew they're doing what we want them to do.  Get this fucking guy.  This is how it has to happen.  Well, that's just it.  It'll never.  When people try to infringe on your Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, it's never going to be kicking the door in and being like, what happened?  It's a nice day.  It's always going to be under this guise of emergency. 
[00:15:00]  And this, I know Alex Jones is going to get into this, believe me.  And there's some validity to it.  It's always going to be under the guise that we're helping you.  We're protecting you.  We're doing something.  The doors will never be kicked in on a nice sunny day where nothing's happening because that's a problem.  And people won't like it.  That's why the cheering was a little disheartening because people accepted it so willingly, even though it was in the course of an emergency. 
[00:15:30]  Because they were scared shitless.  I understand it.  They were scared shitless in their homes.  But it's always going to be because scared shitless.  Now, here's where the Alex Jones conspiracy government orchestrated stuff comes in.  The best way to put a government force on top of the people is to present it as they are helping you, protecting you, saving you from something.  So if something is in the area like that that is endangering you, you will give up your rights to illegal search and seizure, to cops entering your home. 
[00:16:00]  So what's the solution?  I don't know.  I understand everything you're saying, but what's the solution then?  People bash me on Twitter, but I've been like, I don't have a fucking solution.  I don't know.  It just...  Why isn't...  They knew they had a terrorist cornered in Watertown.  Yeah.  So they had to go all in.  They couldn't let that fucking guy get away.  And people wanted him caught.  I mean, and they were obviously carjacking and all that. 
[00:16:30]  Took one carjack to get him out of the area, and then who the fuck knows?  Well, I guess the solution is, and it sounds odd and it sounds obviously biased on my part, but an armed populace, that helps.  You know?  But there are some people, I'm sure, that had weapons.  I'm sure there were some of those homeowners that had guns.  I bet you there were a lot of people in Watertown with weapons.  With some rifles.  And people sense that...  You know, people aren't that dumb.  Like, people, I think, sense that this is what we want you to do right now.  Even though it's inconvenient and annoying, everyone was in a rage about this fucking animal. 
[00:17:00]  Inconvenient and annoying.  He killed a cop.  There's some...  What was the killing of the cop all about?  They're really not getting into that.  Animals.  But why?  I don't know.  Maybe they got spotted?  Who knows?  Maybe they thought they got spotted?  It's very...  That part of the whole thing is very shady.  Why?  We understand they're animals and they're capable of doing some things, but what was the problem  with the cop?  I don't know.  Maybe he was in the way with it.  Maybe they wanted to go by somewhere and he was there.  Right.  You know?  Who knows?  Did they grab his car? 
[00:17:30]  I don't know.  I'm not really sure either.  I don't think they did either, though.  But I know what Ann's saying, but in this case, I think everybody cheered because everyone  knew exactly why it was happening and it was what they wanted to happen.  I even understand why everyone cheered the stuff.  I was just saying watching it.  It plays into the Alex Jones' hands and conspiracy guys in general, obviously.  But go back to 9-11.  If we learn that some of those guys were in our city, let's say they were in, I don't  know, fucking give me the West Village. 
[00:18:00]  It's just small town, yeah.  You would be all in that they moved in like they did up there in Boston to try to get that  fucker.  That's just it.  That's my exact point.  You'd be all in.  You'd be all in.  Well, that's the problem.  You're definitely, you're not going to change that mindset.  No.  Unless, like I said, they started doing this every weekend for a guy that, you know, might  have been drinking and driving or something.  Then you'd be like, what the fuck's going on?  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know what the solution is. 
[00:18:30]  A lot of people, see, Boston's already checking in.  This was by, this was a necessary situation.  By any means necessary.  Yeah, but you can't pick and choose when your fucking rights are going to be.  Yanked from you.  I mean, there was some people, I've seen video of some people being forcibly removed at  gunpoint from their own homes.  Yeah, I'd be pissed off.  Sorry, I got a fucking issue with that.  Why were they being removed?  Sorry.  So they could check the house.  Perhaps they didn't want to fucking leave.  Perhaps they didn't want to let the cops in. 
[00:19:00]  Perhaps they were leaving, but they weren't leaving as quickly or in the manner that the  cops wanted them to.  I have a problem with that.  But were those houses very close to the situation?  It was very close to the situation.  I'm not sure.  I don't know where it was.  Did they know that it was getting closer, that this kid was within a few houses?  Because then at that point, I could see where they get a little more aggressive.  But it's on the outskirts of the perimeter, and they're doing that.  You know?  I mean, I saw the video.  I mean, you have a whole family coming out of their own house with their arms up in the 
[00:19:30]  air, basically, or their hands behind their heads.  One guy started putting his hands down, and he got a little rousted.  Right.  You know?  I haven't seen any of that video.  Do we have a test?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  They're all over the place, these videos.  Well, I know why.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's get some Boston people on the line here.  Who's this?  Brian.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  So the thing with the MIT cop, he was going to the 7-Eleven.  They happened to be in a 7-Eleven, and somebody was robbing. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  He went over there for the disturbance, and he was pulling up.  They thought he was there to get them.  Oh.  They basically just thought about that.  Yeah.  Do you guys understand the luck that's involved with this whole fucking thing?  They decided to go to a 7-Eleven that was held up not by them.  Yes.  A lot of people were confused and thought, hold on, that the brothers were holding up  the 7-Eleven.  No, that's not the case.  They happened to go to a 7-Eleven that was held up more bungling.  I didn't realize that.  Oh, yeah.  The bunglers did that?  It wasn't being held up at the exact time they were there. 
[00:20:30]  It was just before, I think, Brian?  Yeah, I think he was interested in before it.  Because that was misinformation that came out that the brothers were holding up this  7-Eleven for whatever reason.  That's not true.  And that's the only reason that, you know, they got him on fucking camera there.  Wow.  I didn't know he shot himself.  Wow.  I'm so...  You don't know how happy...  But anyway, continue, Brian.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  And the other thing is, they did have Humvees rolling off through Watertown.  They had the National Guard out, they had five or six different SWAT teams sweeping 
[00:21:00]  the 20 radius.  Yeah, no, I saw the Humvees going around.  I just wasn't sure if the MPs were actually part of it.  Yeah, here's the video.  Yeah, the MPs were on the streets.  Full screen.  And the actual boat was one block outside of the 20-block radius that they were searching.  Oh, this is a 1984 shit right here, man.  Coming to get you.  Coming into your hole.  All right, thank you, Brian.  You're welcome.  So, we're looking at a video of the guys filming from across the street from the second story. 
[00:21:30]  These are people that are in their fucking own homes.  Now, what is...  But what happened with this, where his hands have to be...  Like, for what reason?  I guess the cops would say they don't know who anybody is in any of the houses, so put  your hands up and get out.  So, I don't know.  Look, I'm not blaming.  I'm not...  Don't fucking jump on me.  I just have an issue with this.  I'm wondering if people... 
[00:22:00]  Because they did knock on the door.  They didn't break the door down.  I'm wondering if technically you didn't have to let them in, but then you would have just  had a SWAT team surround...  Like, I don't...  You don't have to let them in.  So, I'm saying maybe that even though it's unpleasant, these guys technically didn't have  to leave their homes.  Like, is...  Kenny, you're looking...  I don't know what that...  Over here.  Kenny knows.  He's a law enforcement.  Kenny knows a little bit about this stuff.  Kenneth?  I'd rather reserve comment.  I'm just shocked at your stance on this. 
[00:22:30]  It's not my stance.  It's how I...  I don't have a stance.  I have a feeling.  What...  Why...  Why are you okay with people being taken out of their homes?  You ever hear of sheep, sheepdogs, and wolves?  Yeah.  Maybe you should read that story.  Enlighten us, Kenny.  You can read it.  It's just...  I gotta go get your breakfast and...  No, this is way more poor than eggs.  I'm really upset about this whole fucking thing.  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  These fucking cops risked their lives...  I understand. 
[00:23:00]  I'm not bashing the cops.  I'm bashing...  I'm not bashing anything.  I'm saying that there's a procedure in place.  Not the cops...  The officers themselves are some of the bravest motherfuckers ever.  I understand that.  It's the policy that's in place.  I know what you're saying.  I do know what you're saying.  He's not bashing.  I know what you mean.  It doesn't make me uncomfortable, though.  Because of the motives of why they were doing it.  And I think everybody knew why they were doing it. 
[00:23:30]  Like, it's very rare there's a collective where everybody kind of gets what's happening at the moment.  And everyone's watching it unfold on TV at the moment.  And they all know this guy's here.  Everyone knows he's a terrorist, too.  That's a big one for us in America.  And there's a public danger of him continuing to do it.  And they were right.  And they were right.  They found a shitload of stuff.  They were going to do more stuff.  The question is, legally, the law-wise, if this guy didn't want to leave his house, would he have had to? 
[00:24:00]  Maybe not.  Maybe they wouldn't have gone in after him.  But maybe he would have had a SWAT team surrounding his house.  They were begging everyone out of that fucking house.  I mean, look.  You think the way they took that guy out and made everyone raise their hands.  And meanwhile, this house is like a clown car for the fucking people that keep flying out the door.  You honestly think if they just said, no, officers, we don't want you in here, that they're going to just go, okay, and leave?  No, no, no.  They are forcibly removing people from their homes under the guise of security. 
[00:24:30]  Now, obviously, this was happening.  There was someone on the loose that had killed people and had bombs and whatnot.  More than just someone on the loose.  But you can't fucking, you can't just throw away constitutional rights and pick and choose when you do it based on a situation.  Sorry.  So how are they supposed to check that house?  They were checking every house.  I'm sure, you know, there's a lot of families that left their homes in this exact way, by the way. 
[00:25:00]  This one just happened to be caught on video.  This exercise was going on all over the place.  House after house after house.  Now, was every person brought out like that with their hands above their head?  I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure pretty close, pretty close to this.  There's a presumption of guilt going on here.  There's, there's, uh, illegal entry in the house. 
[00:25:30]  I mean, honestly, can, can, can, can anyone see this fucking point?  I see it completely.  I just don't, I, I do see it.  And I, I also, I completely understand why you're uncomfortable with it.  Yeah.  But I'm not just because it's rare that a situation is happening where everybody is so on, this  is exactly, but it's always going to be a situation.  And would we, would we, would we be having this conversation if the guy got, uh, away?  If here we are on Monday and we don't know where the fuck this guy is, would we be looking 
[00:26:00]  at this video and would you be as, uh, pissed off?  Do you understand it's always going to be a situation, like I was saying, it's not going  to just be cops coming to someone's door and, and busting it.  There's always going to be a situation.  It doesn't matter.  You're just not supposed to be allowed to do this.  You know what the bottom line is?  You're supposed to be allowed to defend your own home against fucking intruders.  Uh, uh, whether it be that terrorist, you know, you go to the officer and go, yeah, that 
[00:26:30]  officer, I'm, uh, I'm armed and I I've checked my fucking house.  There's no one in here.  Thank you.  In Nirvana, maybe.  But the reality is this shit is going to go down.  You're looking at the, I know what you're, you're looking at the overall point of view  of, of, of, of a militia protecting, like, I know, I know where you're going with it and  I know why you're bothered by it.  For you, it's a bigger issue.  It's a bigger issue.  Thank you.  But I don't think that sometimes things, bigger issues that we're kind of, at times  that make sense.  And at times bigger issues is what kills us because like slippery slope, like it's not 
[00:27:00]  like this one situation is a wall.  Then what's next?  But that's the same thing everybody gets crazy about with language.  Well, it's a weird situation.  We let this guy say this.  The N-word goes, well, then why not the F-word?  People get into this crazy, slippery slope stuff.  And what if the kid was in there and he was holding this family hostage?  That might've been part of the reason too.  They didn't know if this kid was holding people hostage in one of these homes.  Or if he was armed.  That's a great point.  Like what, what that might've been part of the thing is that he may have been holding 
[00:27:30]  somebody hostage.  So you're going to really infringe on everybody's rights in an entire town based on the fact  that one house might be held hostage.  That goes against everything that the, the, the, the trade-off for security, uh, Liberty  for security, that, that trade-offs is, it, we're talking about, we're talking about terrorists.  I know, but we're talking about, this was some drug dealer or something.  And they were going through an entire neighborhood looking for a fucking drug dealer. 
[00:28:00]  Well, but unfortunately we had a situation.  What's the criteria?  There's no definition of terrorist.  So you, you, I think it was pretty obvious.  This one was a terrorist though.  We all, we all were on the terrorist bandwagon immediately on this one.  He kills three people and injures a fuckload more.  He kills actually four.  A cop.  But you can't downplay the people that were injured.  Horrific, horrific, horrific injuries.  Not, not injuries they're even going to come back from.  I'm just saying.  Missing limbs all over the fucking place.  Let's say you have a shooter, uh, that shoots a bunch of people, you know, one of these fucking 
[00:28:30]  lunatics and runs into a neighborhood.  Uh, would, would, would that be okay to, to start grabbing people and taking them out  of their homes?  This is a situation where it's one of those rare situations where the, the, the, the  guy, the cops are kind of damned if they do and damned if they don't.  Because if they, if they don't do this, unless you say he does slip away, ah, the fucking  Boston PD's incompetent.  And all the other bodies that pile up at this sleeper cell begins to like, ah, these motherfuckers 
[00:29:00]  that, like, you know, you know, then they're in that really bad situation.  So if they do it, then they're infringing on certain civil, and are there times where,  when the public good is at stake?  Uh-huh.  And I know that the cops will always say that, well, it's for your own good, but are there  times where that's legitimate?  And has that always been the way it is?  Where people's liberty has always been, quote unquote, infringed on briefly during crisis  situations?  All right, let me, let me go to the phones, because, ah, Taylor in Jersey. 
[00:29:30]  Go ahead, Taylor.  Who cares what his job is?  Taylor.  We'll get to tinker and soldier and spy later.  What's up, Taylor?  The Fourth Amendment, you know, the courts have routinely held that in times of crisis and  when there's an imminent threat to security.  There's a, you know, there's the exception that the police can go into your home.  That when they, you know, have reasonable suspicion that there is imminent danger, they can go 
[00:30:00]  in there without a warrant.  Did this qualify for every home like that?  Well, in that area, I think so.  Because they didn't know where the fuck he was.  I think he did.  I don't know.  Given the fact that there were explosives, given the fact that, yeah, he could have been  anywhere, and the fact that the guy was hiding somewhere, you know, as we found out, without  the knowledge of a homeowner, but he could have been in there.  He could have been in a basement.  And he could have been holding somebody hostage with bombs.  You know, if somebody had denied them the right to come in, that probably would have 
[00:30:30]  raised even more suspicion.  And all shit, hold on, all shit went down 16 hours before this.  So it took him 16 more hours to find what fucking house he was in, eventually, or actually  in the boat in the back of the house.  Actually, the homeowner is the one that alerted the police.  The police didn't find it through these searches.  Right.  The homeowner saw blood on the boat and informed the police.  Did he really?  When he was walking through his own yard and he saw blood?  Yeah, probably.  He lifted up the cover.  The kid was getting in the boat. 
[00:31:00]  He was already injured.  So he lifted up the cover and put blood on the boat.  And the homeowner looked, saw the boat, and said, there's blood on there.  Let me call the cops.  Wow.  So none of these searches and the way they were searching got anywhere as far as finding  this guy.  They would have got to the boat eventually.  Yeah, had they gotten there?  I'm sure they were checking boats in the backyards as they were going along.  I'm sure they were.  And by the way, they might have expanded the perimeter and taken a look at that point.  Again, I understand the point. 
[00:31:30]  I understand the danger with the right.  But this is not something that is outside of what courts have allowed before in terms  of giving cops the right to come in to a home that they believe, you know, when they believe  there is a reasonable suspicion.  Yeah, in a home.  I don't think you could classify an entire town full of homes and allow people and allow  officers to go into every single home.  It doesn't fall into that criteria of imminent danger in a home. 
[00:32:00]  If you know someone's in a house, let's say, and of course, if a cop sees a car that's been  involved in a chase and they pull up to a house and the perpetrator runs into the house,  obviously the cops can do that.  That's where it falls into that criteria.  I don't think you can say, well, there's someone in this town.  Let's now go in every single home and see if he's in there.  It doesn't fall into what you're saying.  Let me ask you a question.  This is a crazy example.  But let's say that there's a word comes down that there's a small nuclear device, not one 
[00:32:30]  that will kill a whole city, but one that would wipe out 10,000 people.  And it's being hidden in one of two apartment buildings.  Let's just say they find that out there and they know it's there.  And the only way to get it is to go into every apartment.  Certain rights are going to get stepped on.  Well, that would seem like it would be imminent danger of...  That's probably how they're looking at it on a small scale.  Wasn't this imminent danger?  Yeah, because they don't know if he has... 
[00:33:00]  They don't know.  They're not bullshitting on this one.  Like, when they bullshit and say imminent danger because they want to do something sneaky,  I think that's when people get rousted and upset.  Well, perhaps we will see that.  Perhaps we won't.  That's why I'm just discussing this.  I'm not making an argument for what I'm saying.  I'm just saying that that side of this should be looked at, addressed, and acknowledged that this did happen.  And in the future, it might be a circumstance where there's less an element of danger, 
[00:33:30]  but still this amount of your rights being infringed upon.  And then maybe even less danger.  But, hey, we did it before.  Let's do it again.  Yeah, but this kid proved that he was willing to do anything.  He ran over his own fucking brother in the end.  How pissed would you have been if they came to your house?  How would you have handled it?  I probably would have allowed them to come in and fucking search.  I have nothing to hide or anything.  No, I'm not talking about, like, you have something to hide. 
[00:34:00]  Just your gut feeling, knowing that this is wrong, what they're doing.  How would you handle that if they knocked at your door?  It wouldn't be wrong if I allowed them in, is what I'm saying.  And I would have allowed them in because it would have been for the good of the community.  I understand that.  But when you're not given a choice to let them in or not let them in, there's an issue there.  There's a fucking issue.  Plus, these guys were ornery at that point.  They were under a lot of pressure because a lot of hours went by,  and they still don't know where the fuck this kid was. 
[00:34:30]  Kenny's probably spitting on my sandwich right now.  He's mad at me.  No, but Kenny.  It's not the cops.  I'm not fucking.  I'm not.  It's the policy that's in place.  It's so high up in the fucking pyramid that it's doing their job.  You're saying the state.  The state.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Jim in Arizona.  Jim.  Jim.  Hey.  I just want to tell you, there's an exclusion to the Fourth Amendment when there's a hot pursuit.  And once they set up a perimeter like that, there is no Fourth Amendment violation when they're in hot pursuit. 
[00:35:00]  They can't search the home.  Well, I would really be hard-pressed to think that you can cordon off a town based on a pursuit.  I think that that doesn't fall into the safety area of the exception.  You know what I mean?  I understand.  I know.  Hot pursuit.  I've seen it.  And, again, if the car pulls up to a house or an apartment building and the guy runs in, it gives them a certain latitude with that. 
[00:35:30]  But I don't think this fell into that technically.  I don't know.  I'm just saying.  Why can't people understand?  I think people do.  There's something weird here.  I think people do.  I totally understand it.  Yes.  I know exactly.  And I know for you it's a Second Amendment thing.  And you're deep down, deep, deep underneath it all.  Your whole thing is if we're armed, we protect our own homes.  And we don't need the fucking state walking in and telling me to get out of my house. 
[00:36:00]  I got a fucking gun.  I don't understand the armed part.  It's not always the armed part.  No, but I mean that's part of the part.  But I understand the part.  It's a constitutional issue.  You've got to just start the revolution, man.  What are you waiting for?  It's constitutional.  We look up the Fourth Amendment.  I'm too tired to start a revolution.  Yeah, I'm exhausted.  Jim, you got anything else?  No.  Oh, Jimmy.  Arizona Jim.  All right.  I just don't have a problem with it.  Or I'm not bothered even by those images because of why they were doing it.  And I think everybody knew why they were doing it.  And I think if there was that wink like, well, they don't really have to do it, people would be reacting the way you are. 
[00:36:30]  There'll always be a why they're doing it, though.  That's my other point.  When was the last time we even did this to this extent?  I mean, if this becomes commonplace, I completely see the point.  But that's just it.  The entire government right now is getting very fucking nosy into everyone's business.  Right.  And the power base of the government is creeping in to our lives right now. 
[00:37:00]  They started creeping in in 1776.  Yeah.  Well, we're up to it.  This isn't anything new.  They've been creeping ever since then.  Well, a lot of.  It's just becoming more and more noticeable.  After 9-11, a lot of liberties.  They had good intentions, but they got into our shit immediately.  I don't know.  A lot of weird.  Yeah, it's getting worse and worse as we go along.  So what do we do?  What do we do?  I don't know.  I strongly believe in, you know. 
[00:37:30]  How are we going to push back?  All right.  Because they're going to continue creeping into our lives.  So the question is, how do we push back?  How do we do it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just, what I do know, though, is everyone says, you know, hey, there's, you know, this  was a good reason stuff.  There'll always be a reason.  Please believe me.  There'll always be a reason.  But not always one that everybody understands.  Meaning, like, there's not always going to be a reason that we, everyone reasonable looks  at and says, yes, I do get why this is happening. 
[00:38:00]  And this is, people, if this was happening for some bullshit reason, I think a lot of  people would go, this is fucking bullshit.  Right.  But immediately after, they left, and the motives were.  And the party started.  And they were doing what we wanted them to do.  But, but.  You're a buzzkill, man.  No.  There was a nice party in Watertown Friday night.  They were happy.  People came out of their homes.  They're cheering.  I see it the same thing as, as, you know, our, our, our taxes, you know, they, they go  up so slowly and, and, and over time that we just accepted it. 
[00:38:30]  But if they, if they put tax rates like they have on us now, when they first enacted taxes,  there would have been a revolution.  Yeah, of course.  So it starts like that.  Everything starts like that.  So if, if this is a jump off point, of course we wanted it.  Of course we wanted the cops to search houses because it was very dangerous.  Of course they're not going to do this for some small little thing now, but it, if,  if people don't look at right now, what's going on down the road, it might get to a point 
[00:39:00]  where, oh, here's someone fucking, you know, uh, selling a little fucking weed on the corner,  cordon off the entire corner, search every fucking house.  But no reasonable person would pay 50% taxes back in 19 fucking 30, right?  That's true too.  Yeah, that's exactly.  All right, so what's the answer?  We got to keep an eye on fucking shit and acknowledge when things happen that make us uncomfortable.  That's what I'm saying right now.  I don't know what the solution is.  If something like that happened where it was, I think everyone can agree that this was an 
[00:39:30]  imminent danger or most people can agree.  Sure.  That's why the community, but most people, even reasonable people wouldn't agree if it  was one guy on the loose with just a gun.  I don't think, or an armed robber on the loose or a drug deal.  I just don't think most people would agree that that was an imminent danger for the entire  community.  Right now.  You're right.  But even at, look at what happened with the Japanese in World War II.  They rounded up and put into, and that was a bad thing.  It was a terrible thing.  But it didn't, it didn't begin rolling where all of a sudden groups of people were just 
[00:40:00]  being gathered up and put into camps.  It didn't happen like that.  And that, if any place would have been a jumping off place, it would have been that.  And it didn't.  No, but if you, if you, and believe me, I love the fact that the, we have Guantanamo and  I, I, I'm all for torture.  But you could look at it that way and say, well, you know, we were in World War II at  the time.  Pretty big fucking war.  Sure.  We haven't really had any situations like that since then, where there is a large population 
[00:40:30]  in this country that needs to be sequestered.  Odd Muslims.  Exactly.  So now you look at that and yes, we have taken some and put them into Guantanamo without any  due process to see what'll happen.  Now, these aren't American citizens for the most part.  I think there are maybe a couple from overseas.  Are there?  Um, I'll have to check on that, but it just, believe me, if something, a huge national crisis 
[00:41:00]  happened like World War fucking two, we'd start gathering people up.  I don't know about that.  I think that we are.  Yeah, man.  I think now people are, it's amazing how dumb we've gotten with, we don't do stuff like  that anymore.  We like, not that we should round people up, but we, we literally fucking just bend over  and wait to get fucked again.  I think that we've gotten stupid with, with how fucking overly, Boston's not a polite  city.  No, they didn't.  That's why I love them for it.  Yeah.  They didn't fuck around, man.  No.  I think Bloomberg would have handled it differently.  Of course he would have. 
[00:41:30]  Of course he would have.  Those guys in Boston don't play.  They're like, fuck this.  We got a situation and we're going in and we're getting this motherfucker.  They did what needed to be done in a bad situation.  And they got these fucking animals.  Bloomberg would not have done it.  Even Mayor Menino, they asked how, I think how the kids, I'm calling him the kid because  I can't pronounce his name just like anyone else.  Suspect number two.  And Mayor Menino was saying, who cares?  How great is he?  Who cares?  If you can find that clip, it's great.  What was he asking him about? 
[00:42:00]  How the, how the, how the suspect number two is doing.  Oh, who cares?  And he goes, who cares?  Good.  Wouldn't that be funny?  Like a sitcom, they're both in the same hospital room sharing, like the bed, Menino in one,  him in the other.  Curtain doesn't work.  I'm kind of really all in with what Boston did.  Those motherfuckers did a great job up there in the end.  We've gotten dumb.  Like, look at the, look, look what happened with these guys on 9-11.  Where if information was just shared properly, like we've gotten so worried about being polite 
[00:42:30]  or so worried about that shit that we've become stupid.  Like we've allowed fucking people that we kind of know are a problem to continue to operate.  Yeah.  You know, so it's like, it's not like the U.S. has become this fucking tyrannical state at all.  At all.  I mean, if anything, we've gotten dumber as time has gone.  There's times where I wish they would do shit like that more because there's people I genuinely  want to fucking round it up and shot. 
[00:43:00]  We got to see something that is very, very rare up there.  You know?  Yeah.  I mean, like, if this shit starts going down, you know, on a more regular basis, then man,  do you have a point.  But we saw something extremely rare.  For now.  I don't remember in my lifetime ever seeing anything like that.  It was unbelievable.  Right.  And it was all broadcast.  Everyone was fucking uploading videos all over the place.  Which brings me to my next point.  The brothers, how stupid are they that they assume that they could, like, go unnoticed? 
[00:43:30]  By the finish line.  For fuck's sake, do it at mile eight.  The finish line, these idiots.  I think we're all aware as soon as you leave the house, you're on, I mean, we've said it  over the years.  You're on camera pretty much the entire time you're out of your house now.  Yeah.  But they really thought they could place these bombs, have kind of disguises on, and get  out of there.  Yeah.  Without anyone having video or pictures of them in a way where it was obvious it was  them.  That amazes me.  Because I truly believe they really thought that. 
[00:44:00]  The one kid who was in the hospital, he went back to college.  Yeah.  Supposedly he went to a party.  Went to a party.  Yeah.  And he went to the weight room.  He was working out.  And he's fucking saying to people, they're like, are you seeing this?  And he goes, yeah, I guess tragedies happen all the time.  Right.  This fucking, these cocksuckers were operating like they were very, they were operating according  to the way the U.S. normally handles shit lately.  Like where they could get away with doing something like that. 
[00:44:30]  And the overly politeness would be like, well, we don't want to say anything offensive or  we don't want to step on any toes.  And they didn't realize what city they were in.  And they didn't realize that Boston cops are going to fucking step on your toes hard.  And they are going to do, they did what was necessary and it was unpleasant.  New York City is in between two really tough fucking cities.  Boston doesn't play and Philly doesn't fucking play when it comes to this shit.  They don't fucking play at all.  No.  And New York cops don't. 
[00:45:00]  But the problem is we, and then again, when Giuliani was in charge, they would have  handled it like this.  Oh, I'm not smashing New York cops.  It's like their, their, their hands seem to be tied at times.  Yeah.  So NYPD, though.  Trust me, if you gave the New York cops, you know, the ability, they'd, they'd be all  in with this shit as well.  You know, it's fucked up.  NYPD is our tourist attractions.  Right.  You go into Times Square and stuff and people, all the, all the roofs from around the country  want their pictures with the NYPD guys.  Sure.  Well, there's no show called Boston Blue.  No.  That's why. 
[00:45:30]  Boston Blue.  This kid and his brother really thought they would, you know, kind of sneak away and get  some other shit done.  They didn't leave town.  How do you not realize you're on video, you dumb fucks?  Yeah, they stayed there.  What the fuck?  What a bung, they were, I mean, the fact that, the fact that three people were killed is awful  and they did a lot of bodily damage.  For, with the comp.  Oh yeah, but I mean with the bombs themselves.  But in that crowded situation, thank God these guys were bunglers because literally  if somebody really was good at what they were doing, you could have had 200 people killed. 
[00:46:00]  It could have been a lot worse.  It could have been a lot worse.  And they had more shit.  They were, they were going somewhere else.  I would love to know if that's going to come out.  Just where they took the bombs from.  They were going to do something on Friday, I guess, Thursday or Friday.  They were prepared to do something else.  I think there was an imminent danger here to the community because I think, again, they,  and plus, don't forget it, by the time they were searching house to house, they had found  bombs in the car.  Uh-huh.  So, there was a lot of things, there was a lot of things that were fucking making this  an imminent danger case as opposed to them just saying a guy's selling weed. 
[00:46:30]  I think that this one was very easily sold because it was real.  Let's go to Nathan.  I'm not hungry.  He wants to deal with semantics here.  Nathan, go ahead.  Go ahead, Nate.  All right, listen, these guys, they're not terrorists, they're traitors, all right?  They're Americans.  They're not Americans.  They attacked Americans for being American.  They were traitors.  Are they really Americans, though?  They were officially Americans, sure.  Wait, were they Americans or just allowed to be here?  I believe they were Americans officially.  They were citizens? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, they were citizens?  Okay.  So, technically, they're traitors, not terrorists?  Right.  They attacked them.  Wouldn't that be the, wouldn't they be homegrown terrorists, then?  They're terrorists.  There isn't a real criteria for terrorists.  That's another thing.  It's subjective.  I guess, technically, they're traitors.  You know, a bank robber is someone that goes in and robs a bank.  You know, you kind of got that set.  A terrorist is like, it's this vague, Iraq-ish, vagery that, you know, it could cover a lot of areas. 
[00:47:30]  It depends on where you're standing.  Like, I was watching something on these freedom fighters, and Carlin had a brilliant bit about freedom fighters.  Shut up.  All right, thank you, Nathan.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you, Nathan.  The point I'm making is it depends on where you're standing.  Like, you know, some people look at Al-Qaeda as fucking heroes who are fighting this despicable U.S., and we see them as terrorists, whereas there are certain people we see as freedom fighters fighting an oppressive government.  But people, it really does all depend on where you're standing.  Terrorism is a vague thing. 
[00:48:00]  The fucking insane people in Afghanistan that were fighting, the Mujahideen, that were fighting the Russians were freedom fighters.  We called them freedom fighters when the Russians were there.  And then when they became fucking Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, then we call them terrorists.  Sure, absolutely.  Just add a few years and a few things.  I mean, that's fine because we did the same thing with the Japanese.  They were despicable fucking enemies that were to be killed and spit on.  And now they're one of our closest allies. 
[00:48:30]  You just had a little time.  We got a lot of phone calls.  Eric says Jimmy should be more concerned.  There are a lot of problems with these searches.  Eric, is Eric on?  Yeah, hold on.  Dave, in Jersey, it's about trust, the government coming in and doing something inside your house.  Jay in Cleveland, I got a problem with Anthony's view.  This guy, Adam in Los Angeles, I agree with Anthony.  Do we have proof if the people decline the officer's entry?  I want to back up Anthony.  I agree with Anthony.  Do we have proof if the people decline the officer's entry? 
[00:49:00]  At what point do you draw the line?  They could have used thermal imaging on the houses.  Just some of the many phone calls coming right now.  I want to talk to Eric because if he's disagreeing with me, let's hear what he has to say.  And by the way, if he did thermal imaging, then people would say, well, you're using the technology to look into our...  There's no winning.  Eric, go ahead, sir.  You can't usually do thermal imaging through fucking roofs.  Two points here.  First off, Jimmy, you're saying that you don't have a problem with this, but let me give you a hypothetical situation. 
[00:49:30]  It's your house.  You're sitting there.  You know, you like to watch porn.  Yep.  Let's say you're sitting there watching kiddie porn.  This type of thing.  Okay, you're sitting there watching kiddie porn.  You're completely below the radar, and you're not uploading it.  You're just watching it.  The cops come by, knock on the door, drag you out.  They go through and search the house.  Now, if you remember on Friday, you weren't there, but when the boys were talking about this, and they're listening to the scanner,  and the cops are giving all these codes and police lingo over the radio, and nobody knows what it is. 
[00:50:00]  So let's say they come through, they drag you out, and you say, oh, go ahead, search my house.  There's nothing to worry about.  They go through, and they see kiddie porn on your computer.  Now, they're not going to worry about it right then and there.  But let's say one of those officers sees that, and he gives a code for it over the air.  Right, right.  They document it.  Three weeks from now, they come back, and they knock on your door.  All right, Eric.  By the way.  Hold on, Eric.  Let me talk with you.  I understand where you're going with this, and I know that there's always going to be hypotheticals. 
[00:50:30]  First of all, I still think in that case, the dominating or important factor should be the public good and the public safety under which there are.  Because I do believe their intentions was that they thought there was an imminent danger.  I don't believe they were lying about that.  I believe that they were being very genuine about that.  So I think the imminent danger to the public is more important in that moment than the right of a person who is absolutely committing a crime. 
[00:51:00]  And watching kiddie porn, by the way, is a crime.  Uploading it, downloading it, you are committing a crime.  Yeah, and I hated your fucking example, by the way.  So I know what you mean, though.  That's terrible.  That's a horrendous example.  Say you were doing coke off the table.  Really?  I know what you mean.  I think it made it a little easier to fucking digest.  Yeah, there's a pile of coke on the fucking table.  You need to do a cocaine table, yeah.  Sounds like someone might be into kiddie porn.  So I know what you mean, but you're taking a crazy example.  So do you think...  That's the closest example I can come up with.  Okay, so think of doing cocaine. 
[00:51:30]  Something that doesn't really offend the entire fucking civilized world.  Exactly.  Which makes it really tough to even listen to your point.  So say someone's doing cocaine, and you're saying then they notice there's some coke on the mirror,  or they see that you're doing coke, and blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  That is...  That's the question I came up with.  Okay, fair enough.  So that's something that you have to examine.  Do you think in that moment that the imminent danger is more important,  or the right for that person to privately commit the crime is more important?  And believe me, I'm not giving up my fucking rights for security. 
[00:52:00]  It's the right.  The right is the most important thing.  The right of the person to be safe and secure in their home,  without infringement by the cops to mourn...  And technically, they're not supposed to be allowed to do anything  if they see anything illegal happen in the house.  But you goddamn know they're going to write a little note down in their pad  and go, well, this house on Maple Street here, let's, you know, revisit this.  Maybe not.  I mean...  I bet they would.  Can I bring up one other...  Maybe, you know, when you get back into your home, you should clean up your... 
[00:52:30]  Clean up your blow.  Your laundry a little bit.  Your coke and your kiddie porn.  Because maybe they are coming back.  But I'm saying operating under imminent danger, not operating under them just walking in.  Because, again, like you say, if someone's in their own hot pursuit  and they know that the suspect ran into one of two houses and he's armed,  they do have the right in hot pursuit.  So they were...  This was considered a hot pursuit area.  That, to me, is the difference.  This is not just them sectioning...  I don't think you could cordon off an entire town for a pursuit.  I think that oversteps the boundary. 
[00:53:00]  Again, I'm not sure.  I don't know what the solution is.  I disagree that it oversteps the boundary.  In this case.  I've got to add one important point here, because a lot of people are calling from all  over the country, right?  But if you're in Watertown, I would love to hear from the homeowners of Watertown.  Were they okay with this, knowing that there was a terrorist in their fucking town?  I'm sure they were okay with it.  Right, because if there's a terrorist in my fucking building, I don't give a fuck who  comes through my apartment to make sure he's not in my apartment.  But that's one of my...  I don't give a fuck at that point.  That's one of my biggest points.  But when you look from a distance, like you are, is it different? 
[00:53:30]  From a distance?  I would love to know what the Watertown people are saying, because that's important to the  story here.  It's kind of like your thought on guns.  Like, all these people that are against guns, the first thing they wish they had if someone  was in their fucking house was a gun, right?  Yeah.  And so, I mean, if this was happening in your building or your neighborhood, would you be  okay with this?  It's easy to say no if you're not part of the situation.  And I love these guys on Twitter.  Do ya?  ELJD. 
[00:54:00]  Do ya?  Says, hey, Anthony, Jim is so used to handing himself over to a higher power, he cannot realize  how dangerous last Friday was to freedom.  Hey, cunt.  Believe me when I tell you, I get the point.  Yeah.  It's not lost on me.  Jim, what do they mean by that?  I don't get it.  The government's good.  I get it, cocksucker.  I fucking process it.  I comprehend it. 
[00:54:30]  I don't agree that it was a threat to freedom.  You're not fucking seeing something I don't...  Hey, Jim, you mean...  What do you mean they're good?  They're good people.  They won't hurt me.  I really do get the point.  And I've weighed it, which is why, you dumb fuck, I'm saying things like imminent danger,  and I do believe that it qualifies as part of the pursuit, and I get why they did it. 
[00:55:00]  I'm not lost on that.  If it was for something else, I would have a major issue with it, but I don't for that reason.  So I guess every time they fucking send somebody in, if you want to break down and go down the slippery slope argument, you know what?  No more profiling in mosques, because people do complain about that, and that is somehow a fucking...  And I understand the difference.  Jim doesn't get the difference between the mosques and the people coming into the house.  Yeah! 
[00:55:30]  Genius!  I get it!  I got it!  You do?  But I just...  You're learning that someone might disagree with you on Twitter.  I think you're learning that today.  It's not the disagreement, but it's the fucking arrogance of some cocksucker like this.  Just assuming way too much...  I think I don't get it.  Right.  Like, I don't see what a big threat it is.  Gee, thanks a lot, pal.  Why don't you tell me?  Ma-ha-ha!  Ma-ha-ha!  What do you tell me?  Ma-ha-ha!  It's a cheap...  Meanwhile, all I do is criticize language policing and infringement on thought. 
[00:56:00]  My fucking whole existence is critiquing and attacking infringement on thought.  But yet I'm happy if they walk into my house, come on in, boys!  Take a look around!  I love paying taxes!  I never complain.  And I want to add, I completely understand what Ant's trying to say here today.  Of course I do.  Of course.  And it should be discussed, but I completely disagree,  and I'm completely okay with what they did up there in Boston under this particular situation. 
[00:56:30]  The discussion was the most important part about this,  and that's what I was saying on Twitter also, is just to discuss it,  to get all the points of view on this and talk about it,  because if you just get the one side, it seems a little odd.  All right, let's go to Jay and Cleveland.  Jay, go ahead, Jay.  No, you could call me, Ray.  Let's not waste too much more time on this,  because we've got to get to Neil Diamond fucking up his own song.  I'm not in the camp of, oh, what a great moment. 
[00:57:00]  I'm in the camp of, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?  He doesn't even know his own song.  He sucked.  But anyway, go ahead, Jay and Cleveland.  Hey, Ant, I agree with you on this point,  but it goes back on things you said about stop and frisk.  That's the whole thing, like me being a black guy.  I don't want to be just stopped by a cop walking down the street  and having my rights infringed on me just because.  Well, I've always said...  Oh, boy, you've got to agree with a black guy today.  No, no, legally and constitutionally, 
[00:57:30]  I've always had a problem with stop and frisk on a legal thing.  I've kind of looked the other way and thought like, eh, well...  It's for the public good.  It's like, eh, it gets fucking, you know...  But I've always legally thought there was an issue there.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I'm not Mr. Fucking Constitution.  There are certain aspects where I'm like,  but good, take him down, pummel his fucking face.  But, you know, that's what we're doing. 
[00:58:00]  We're fucking bringing shit up.  The people who are like...  And I'm not annoyed at Ant.  I'm not annoyed at you.  My annoyance is with that guy on Twitter thinking I didn't get what he was...  I fucking get it, you dummy.  Of course.  And I understand...  Believe me, I'm bright enough to comprehend the point.  I just disagree with it.  I'm seeing it differently.  And in this case, I buy the explanation of the government.  There's a lot of people that listen to our show with half a year  and then assume a lot.  It happens all the fucking time.  It amazes me on a daily basis.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, do you have the Mayor Menino clip that we referenced  before we go to break?  We got a Boston Bomber family speaking out.  Oh, the dad of the brothers.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  We got some audio from him.  We got a great clip from North Dakota, that news anchor.  This thing will be...  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  This will be so fucking violent.  I love that one.  All right.  And other things, but...  NS to you, you're blocked because you're a fucking cunt.  Why?  What happened? 
[00:59:00]  I've never blocked a person on Twitter.  This is, again, what I...  Not that I hate Twitter.  I love Twitter.  What I hate about people on it.  Yeah.  What if the government decided Muslim jokes posed a danger to us  and suspended the First Amendment?  So this is the type of fucking...  This is girlfriend type of shit, you dumb motherfucker.  Like, you're playing semantics games.  Yeah, yeah.  You're just trying to be the lawyer.  In this case, are you really telling me, you dummy, that you don't understand the difference 
[00:59:30]  between a Muslim joke where the government trying to say that this speech poses a danger  and a guy where they found bombs in his truck.  Everything in the world is not a cunting, slippery slope.  Sometimes a cigar is just a fucking cigar.  That you put in your ass.  Absolutely.  And hopefully it's black with two balls on it.  But this...  Do you understand?  Like, if you find me an example where you can tie in your dumb fucking example 
[01:00:00]  with two guys who just killed a cop, bombed the marathon, had bombs in the truck,  and were shooting it out with the police, you find me the example that poses the imminent  danger in language.  Otherwise, you're just a fucking...  You're just playing semantics.  Dutch cartoonist?  There you go.  But that kind of goes with search every house and fucking...  Because he ain't the problem.  Let's say hi to Scott in Boston.  Scott has a lot here.  Go ahead, Scott. 
[01:00:30]  Do we know how the MBTA...  Hey, guys.  All right.  I just wanted to start.  Sean Collier, the officer that was murdered in MIT, was a good friend of mine and co-worker.  We were partners for a number of years.  Don't want to let him be pushed back by these bombers.  He's the hero here.  Not them.  So, start with that.  Sorry to hear, by the way, about your friend now.  It's horrible.  It is. 
[01:01:00]  But you know what?  I don't...  Wait, wait, wait.  I got to slow you down a little bit.  Why was he murdered?  Like, what are they saying so far?  That's the thing.  He was there for a disturbance call.  So, it wasn't even a robbery, as far as they're saying, and as far as I'm getting from, you know, my friends and stuff like that.  He was there for a disturbance call.  He pulled up.  He was checking his radio.  He didn't even get out of his cruiser.  So, the brothers were there, and they probably got completely paranoid, like, oh, fuck, they're on to us, and here, you know, we got to take out the cop if we're going to get away. 
[01:01:30]  Exactly.  Even though the cop wasn't there for them.  That's the weird fucking thing here.  Yeah, that's the weirdest, the whole fucking...  I'm starting to get it a little bit.  Right, okay.  And, so, you know, because of him showing up, I mean, these kids, he basically blew up their spot.  I mean, God only knows what the hell they were going to go to that night. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Because they had all their equipment with them.  Right.  They had another one of those bombs that they set off the marathon with them.  The pressure cooker bomb, yeah.  So, what the fuck were they going to do?  Yeah.  That's the main...  They were going to do something.  Of course.  And that's why, dude, that's why this argument is so crazy, like, and again, not Ann's point, but the way people act like nobody gets it.  It's like, it's rare that you have these sets of circumstances.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  It's out of this world of exactly what...  No, it's who's on earth.  And then...  Hold on, Chip, cool me up.  Good job, cocksucker.  All right.  All right, what else you got, Scott?  But, you know, in the search after Watertown, I'm originally from Watertown, and, you know, a couple of my friends lived in the area, and, you know, one of my friends, he's a lawyer, and they came to his house to search, and he was more than happy with his wife and his two daughters to let them in. 
[01:03:00]  And you know what?  They're not looking for anything, and they were apologetic the whole time.  Fine.  Nothing but gentlemen.  And the other thing is, is they're in there looking for these guys.  I mean, this guy.  But the officers that are doing the searching, they're not from Watertown.  They're not cops from anywhere around there that are going to remember it.  Plus, you've got to remember, these guys are searching, like, a hundred houses in one neighborhood. 
[01:03:30]  But they're not coming back to find a fucking joint or a line of blow.  Most likely not.  They don't give a fucking fuck about it.  Unless it was some crazy over-the-top thing they just happened to discover, maybe.  No.  And another thing is, there's a video that some kid took on his porch during the original shooting in Watertown there, where responding officers were running to the scene.  And one of the cops stopped and saw the kid and asked him, hey, do you have any rifles in the house? 
[01:04:00]  And the funniest thing is, you know, you think about all this Second Amendment bullshit that's going on.  But then, me as a cop, I think, hey, remember in L.A. when those two guys robbed the bank, and they were fucking outgunned and outnumbered on the street?  And they went to a fucking gun shop, and the gun shop had more AR-15s and M-16s than the cops had.  And that guy armed about, I think, ten officers at the time. 
[01:04:30]  So this guy was just grasping at straws because he figured, hey, hopefully somebody might have a gun that can help us.  And is there also something as a cop where if you're allowed to commandeer a vehicle in extenuating circumstances, is that right?  Aren't you allowed to take somebody's car?  Did I say it right?  If it is a chase or...  We've heard that over the years.  Is it true?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It doesn't get used very much.  I mean, you could. 
[01:05:00]  You're supposed to stand in the middle of the street, and you hold your badge straight out.  And you go, stop!  Give me your car!  And then you jump in.  I've been in law enforcement for ten-plus years, and I've never done that.  And I don't know anybody that has.  Yeah, it's rarely used, I would assume.  Oh, yeah, I mean...  But TV shows use it all the time.  But when that happens, all of a sudden the government doesn't just take all our cars.  TV shows also use the Miranda warning every time they arrest somebody, too. 
[01:05:30]  Right.  Which you really don't have to until, you know, you get them to the prison, I mean, to the police station.  And by the way, there is the exception where they don't have to Mirandize this guy, I think, because he, you know, again, is a danger.  But there's people who are questioning that.  So in the line of that, should we not let him, should we make, let him just lawyer up in this situation where we know there's something else right behind this?  Like, should we be such constitutional purists that we say, okay, that's the Constitution, lawyer up, and then allow more people to get killed? 
[01:06:00]  Like, what Senator said, or whatever it was after 9-11, the Constitution is not a suicide pact?  Like, it's intended to help the people and to strengthen the people.  I don't think it's intended to be used by people who are genuinely criminals to protect themselves or to continue committing crimes.  So what's the balance we have? 
[01:06:30]  I don't think so.  I mean, it's – their main thing with that is they want to find out what else was going on at the time.  They need to – they wanted to find out – I think they're using that as their, you know, are there other bombs?  You know, what were you doing that night?  Who's in danger?  Do you have other people out there that are going to continue on?  Right.  Right.  You know?  I mean, there's more and more information coming out every day.  Yeah, I know.  I'm trying to find it out here, but awesome friend. 
[01:07:00]  Thank you, Scott.  Scott, thank you so much, sir.  No, no problem, guys.  Thank you.  All right, buddy.  Keep John Collier's memory alive, please.  You just did.  Thank you, man.  Thanks, guys.  Would have been a truck driver if he wasn't –  I wonder how many people would throw all their constitutional rights out the fucking window if this shit was happening in their neighborhood.  That's the question I have.  Yeah.  It's easy to fucking get all pissed off and concerned about what they did in Boston, but how would you handle it in your neighborhood is the big question today. 
[01:07:30]  The first thing –  Would you be like, thank fucking God you're here, or would you be like, get the fuck out of my house?  I think the first thing you've got to do before you give your rights away is even know you have them.  Right.  A lot of people just – a lot of people are very willing in this day and age to just, you know, well, whatever.  You know, eh, they do, you know, just put trust in the government and what they do and kind of throw away some of your rights. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Good luck in that sandwich that Kenny just got you.  I know, right?  Oh, my God.  I think Kenny's mad at me.  I don't know.  I'm just –  He's coming in.  I'm like Troy Kwan.  I'm just asking questions.  He's just asking questions, Kenny.  He's just asking questions.  I'm like Troy Kwan.  I'm just asking questions.  You're entitled to your opinion.  I just didn't realize you were a sovereign citizen.  What?  What's a sovereign citizen mean?  What's a sovereign citizen?  Well, they don't recognize the government and laws. 
[01:08:30]  They just do what they think they should do.  No, I do acknowledge the laws, the laws of the Constitution.  Have you ever risked your life for a stranger?  No.  Okay.  Enough said.  I think I could have –  He's not even nice to his friends.  I know.  Yeah.  But I don't think Ant's being that unreasonably, either, and saying, fuck this.  I think it's about state power.  It's just a question.  I don't think it's a great question.  I'm just throwing it out there.  Those cops are heroes, and they did what they needed to do.  Absolutely.  All right?  Yes.  And all those crybabies, they can cry all they want, but it had to be done. 
[01:09:00]  And it was done reasonably.  They don't have to be right.  They have to be reasonable.  That's the bottom line.  Well, what is the law about it?  Like, what law do they –  Stone Cold says so.  Is it an imminent danger thing?  Look, in the heat of the moment, you've got to do what a cop tells you to do.  If the cop ends up being wrong, that's what there's courts for.  I'm so uncomfortable right now.  He and Kenny were good friends for a while. 
[01:09:30]  I don't know what happened.  Now I'm a commie.  Well, you're kind of dressed like one, so it's no surprise.  No.  But your issue's not with the cops.  No.  All right.  And my issue isn't even with anything.  I'm just fucking – I'm just bringing up a subject.  The disturbing thing is seeing footage here that we normally see in other countries.  Like that bomb scene was something you normally see in fucking – in Europe or in Libya or 
[01:10:00]  Syria, like a bunch of people in a marketplace.  We're not used to seeing that here.  Well, that's what I said earlier.  It just continues to creep into our lives because we never saw anyone with an automatic  weapon on the streets before 9-11.  Remember that?  Remember the first time you saw someone guarding an airport or a subway station with automatic  weapons?  You're like, what the fuck?  This is what you see in other countries.  And now we're kind of used to it.  If it's any consolation, I really would have loved if they just lobbed grenades into that 
[01:10:30]  boat and fucking, you know, vaporized them.  That would have been nice.  And too little, too late.  And maybe the curb?  Bite the curb?  Bite the curb?  And then you stomp on the back of his head?  Too little, too late.  He's not even looking at you.  Because on a personal level, I just, you know, yeah, fucking chop him up.  I don't care.  I hate that guy.  Fuck him.  Too late.  Probably not.  Too late.  But apparently the cops are the criminals.  Too late.  Apparently the cops are the cops.  I didn't say that.  Apparently the tyranny of the state over fucking, you know. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, my God.  We really have to break.  We have lots more to cover as far as the Boston situation goes.  And then we can tell you all how to file lawsuits against all the police who damaged their  lives up there.  So, young freedom fighter.  I hope he's okay.  We got so much to cover.  Stay there.  Is this Believe It or Not? 
[01:11:30]  I've been walking these streets so long.  Huh?  That would have been great.  Singing the same old song.  Oh, yeah.  We got Neil Diamond.  Sure.  I know every crack.  This is, um...  It's not Neil Diamond.  This is...  No, this is Neil Diamond, I know.  No.  No, it is.  I'm telling you.  Glenn Campbell.  Where hustle's the name of the game.  Yeah.  The skies get washed away like the snow and the rain.  Damn. 
[01:12:00]  The feet are low to compromising.  On the road to my horizon.  But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me.  Everybody, everybody, like a rhinestone cowboy.  What?  Why the Glenn Campbell today?  It's his birth?  It's his birthday.  How old is he?  And don't ask him.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:12:30]  That's right.  We haven't heard from him in a while since he announced the Alzheimer's.  76 today, huh?  Is he?  Jack Nicholson was the one, though.  That's the big get.  75 today.  Oh.  Jack Nicholson is 75 years old.  Anyone do a good Jack Nicholson impression, Jim?  You know, sometimes we come here on the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[01:13:00]  Here's Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Right on the money.  I love it.  We gotta play the Mayor Menino clip, please.  We tease that.  So it's quick.  This is Mayor Menino, who I think has done a pretty good job up there in Boston.  Yeah.  Considering he's in a wheelchair and has all sorts of medical issues at this point.  Goddamn wreck.  But he had this to say.  MBTA transit officer is doing today.  Is there improvement for him?  He's showing some improvement.  He is. 
[01:13:30]  He has encouraging to us to show improvement.  And what about the suspect who's still in the hospital?  Who cares?  Bravo.  Good for him.  Who cares?  Good honest language.  Good for him.  Bravo.  Who cares?  Exactly.  Who cares?  They're not a pussy city worried about being polite.  Good for Boston.  Nope.  And then we move on to Dave Ortiz.  Yes.  So they're having a big fucking...  Big poppy.  Big poppy.  Of course.  Big poppy.  Poppy!  And he decided to talk to the people at Fenway. 
[01:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  And this is what he had to say.  Everyone's talking about this today as well.  All right, Boston.  This jealousy that we wear today, it doesn't say Red Sox.  It's a Boston.  We want to thank you, Mayor Menino, Governor Patrick, the whole police department for the great job that they did this past week. 
[01:14:30]  He's a fucking city.  And no matter what I think today, I feel you.  Stay safe.  Thank you.  That's awesome.  Poppy is a little sloppy.  That's awesome. 
[01:15:00]  It's too bad that's...  Huh?  He retired?  No.  There's a sign that says, welcome back, Big Poppy.  Is he not playing with them anymore, or is he?  Mm-hmm.  Come on, man.  He was hurt.  Oh!  Oh, I thought he was retired.  I didn't know it.  I was like, fucking, like, oh, boy.  For a second, I didn't know the answer to that.  He's very injured.  Okay.  It's too bad that's the best version of that.  No, I'm not blaming you, Sam.  Trust me, because I tried to find a good version of it over the weekend, and I just couldn't fucking find one.  That was it.  Yeah.  You'd think there would have been a better version of that out there, because everyone's talking about it. 
[01:15:30]  And then the stupid fucking FCC had a tweet that they're okay that he cursed on live TV.  Yeah, we'll give him a pass.  And I go, you know what?  Fuck you.  Fuck you to the FCC.  Better than trying to fine him.  But they had a tweet.  We're okay with this.  Are you?  Because they probably don't want the influx of letters.  Go fuck yourself.  And then to the rest of the media, then they're playing this big moment that happened at Fenway, right?  Yeah.  And, of course, they're beeping out the whole reason why you're playing it. 
[01:16:00]  Well, yeah.  But you see the carnage they showed us on TV the last week, but they're beeping out curses?  We've learned over the years.  If I was the news boss, I would have just said, you know what?  Fuck it.  Play him saying fuck.  Yeah.  Or a fucking.  Over the years, we've learned that violence is fine.  Cursing and titties.  Whoa.  That could fuck people up.  And who are we protecting?  The children?  It's the children.  And I finally got an angle on this because I'm a father. 
[01:16:30]  Who?  What was more concerning is every time they showed the footage of the bombs going off, as a parent, me and my wife are looking at each other like, all right, we've got to fucking turn this off again, right?  But as far as cursing, I don't even think twice about it.  I don't care if my son hears the word fuck.  Exactly.  They're so out of touch.  You see the bloody sidewalks and the bombs and the carnage.  That's the scary stuff.  That's all the scary shit. 
[01:17:00]  But once again, I'm for all of it.  Trust me.  I really am.  But as far as what's bothersome to my own kid, it's not language.  God, no, it's not.  Not in the least.  He's going to be a little potty mouth.  I hope so.  I hope so.  He's going to be a jock.  Because I think it's completely ridiculous.  Yeah.  I'll just teach him when to use the potty language, I guess.  Yeah.  But I don't care if he uses potty language.  Yeah, do some parenting.  Tell him when to use the curses.  Yeah, of course. 
[01:17:30]  Of course.  But the FCC had a tweet.  We're okay with this.  Oh, thank you.  Thank God you're okay with it.  We have their permission.  Don't fuck yourself.  To not be offended.  Yeah.  So we had that.  And then Neil Diamond.  Yeah.  Boston had what could have been an amazing moment.  Sorry.  Somebody twitters.  Just tell the cops, you're in my fucking house.  Boston could have had an amazing moment. 
[01:18:00]  Neil Diamond decided, you know what?  I got it.  I got to be there.  Yeah.  So he took a red eye.  They had to say it was a red eye.  Uh-huh.  From California.  And he made it to the game to sing, you know, Sweet Caroline.  Which is the big song they play at every fucking game up there.  And why do they have him singing over his own song?  Yeah, that's the weirdest thing.  Why didn't they just get a stupid karaoke version and say, it's your song. 
[01:18:30]  You wrote it, so here.  Get a track without the vocals.  Give him a fucking earphone so he's hearing the track as it's being played.  Right.  Not kicked back through the PA at him, so he's two seconds off of the song.  Was it last minute maybe they threw it together?  Maybe he was just supposed to be there and wave.  And then they're like, why don't you sing?  And he went, all right.  It might have been last minute.  But, I mean, Jesus.  Maybe the police broke into his house and stepped on his karaoke machine.  They confiscated it.  They thought it was a big bomb and they took it. 
[01:19:00]  A tyranny of the state.  But when you talk on a baseball field, your voice comes back to you two seconds later.  Yeah.  And it really fucks you up bad.  Yeah.  If he doesn't have a monitor right there, he's fucked.  And some saying he was drunk.  I don't think it was that at all.  He was disoriented because it was coming back at him.  Yeah.  There's no way to sing along with a track that is being played through speakers that are far away.  Sure there is.  Well, like that.  Poorly.  Yes.  So, um, we should play the Neil Diamond for everybody. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Neil Diamond.  Over the weekend, him singing over his own fucking song.  Do-do-do.  No, no, no, no, no.  But the place went nuts, of course.  Yeah.  He looks pretty good.  Neil.  Neil.  Thank you, Boston.  Thank you, Boston.  What an honor it is for me to be here today. 
[01:20:00]  Oof.  Shut up.  I bring love from the whole country.  Oh, good.  Thanks, Neil.  Oh, good.  This is probably thinking this again.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Great.  Everybody.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's off. 
[01:20:30]  Why the fuck would they play the song?  I don't know.  Exactly.  I'm just singing a cappella, you dummy.  They have to have a karaoke version laying around.  Someone could have grabbed it from their iPhone.  I like the fact that nobody knows the words.  He's almost a second behind.  Yeah.  He's a dope.  Nice big tits, lady.  Yeah, right.  Look at that pig. 
[01:21:00]  That's Stephen King.  He's a good dancer, Neil Diamond.  Oh, yeah.  With his tight pants.  Jesus.  You know, big belly.  Oh, sweetie.  Do you see that?  Look at his belly.  Yeah.  Do you see the two guys' face making out?  No, really?  He's fucking out. 
[01:21:30]  See these two guys on the upper left?  I don't think they're faking it.  Watch these two guys.  They look a little prissy.  No, they're just being assholes.  He's tonguing.  And they quickly went with them.  They saw it on the monitor.  That's funny.  They saw themselves on the monitor.  Yeah.  Guy's grabbing his friend's head hard and just sticking his tongue out and going back  and forth, flailing his tongue.  Don't mess with Nicole, man.  She fucking gave us the business on Friday. 
[01:22:00]  Why?  She was...  I think she was fucking hungover.  I don't know.  Was she cranky?  I was going to say.  She was pretty cranky.  She almost punched me in the face.  Why?  And then I was trying to figure out if I could take a punch from her to the face.  I thought it would be fun.  She would have.  Huh?  She would have done it.  Was she really in a bad mood?  Yeah, she was not in a mood for the bullshit.  But it would suck if she broke my nose or something.  But I was debating it to take a shot from Nicole.  It would have been all right if she broke my nose.  Who cares if she broke your nose? 
[01:22:30]  She would have done some damage.  Why was she in a bad mood?  I don't know.  Let's get her in here.  I got a couple questions.  All right.  Back to Sweet Caroline.  Love these two guys.  Fucking hell.  Fucking hell.  Is he hearing the music at a different time now?  Yeah.  It's fucking him up. 
[01:23:00]  Now they just put more echo on him, which makes it even worse.  And when I heard it, it comes off my shoulders.  He's singing when he's hearing it.  For him, yeah.  He's hearing it when he's...  When I'm here with you.  You.  You.  Warm.  Warm.  Warm. 
[01:23:30]  Touching.  Warm.  Reaching out.  Touching me.  Touching you.  Eeeeee.  Sweet Caroline.  Da, da, da.  Because I've seen so good.  I've been inclined. 
[01:24:00]  All right, we're coming to the last chorus.  It's going to feel like, why the audience note ahead of it.  Neil's enjoying some pizza.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  When it's time to change, you know it's time to change.  We have someone that was at the...  Time turns to winter, and winter turns to spring. 
[01:25:00]  Time to change.  We have someone that was at the game.  Matt in New Hampshire.  Matt.  Matt.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Matt.  Yeah, I was at the game.  Huge Red Sox fan.  The emotion...  How big are you?  Wait, about 6'12 or something?  The emotion throughout the game was overwhelming.  But that part when Neil Diamond came out was hilarious, because all you could focus on  was the timing that was off and his gut that was sticking out of his shirt. 
[01:25:30]  His gut is...  I never realized, but he's got a huge gut on him.  Yeah.  He should change the name of that song to I Eat Sweets, Caroline.  Get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Get it.  It was great.  Thank you, guys.  All right, brother.  Yeah.  It was almost an amazing moment.  Almost.  Yeah.  Man.  So, when all the shit was going down on Friday, the internet was way the fuck ahead of mainstream 
[01:26:00]  media.  Certainly was.  Way ahead.  And it was weird, because the mainstream media has the same technology that the internet  had.  Police scanners and such.  It's that old school, you know, we have to, you know, go through our sources and hit  the streets and pound the pavement and talk to the people.  Well, that's not working as well anymore.  No.  No.  A whole new way to get your news is go on Twitter or whatever. 
[01:26:30]  Facebook even.  Well, and I was having an argument with people over the weekend.  You still got to decipher what's out there.  Yeah.  Because the people are like, oh, the internet was also getting things wrong.  Yeah, you still got to decipher for yourself and try to figure out shit.  Yeah.  Right?  God, that was fucking weird.  What?  I just saw it.  That song, Come on, Eileen, 30 years ago.  30 years?  Ouch.  Oh, uh-oh.  Yes, Chip?  What's the name of the song? 
[01:27:00]  Come on, Eileen.  It just makes a face.  Fuck yeah.  You like that?  Logan, what's the name of the song?  Come on, Eileen.  Come on, Eileen.  Fuck it, you don't get it.  Well, 30 years ago.  People are arguing that Sweet Caroline is not Boston's song.  It's just a song they adopted. 
[01:27:30]  They play every fucking home game.  So is fucking YMCA the Yankees song?  But now they're arguing that point on Twitter.  It's always just an argument.  It's just been their song for a while.  Yeah.  Anyway, so I think it was Brian Williams was going to one of his reporters in the field  as shit was getting fucking heavy up there in Watertown.  And this reporter had no idea that he was on live TV and said this. 
[01:28:00]  This is classic.  Oh, you're not listening?  Oh, we don't know.  I don't know.  Well, that was a fortuitous time to dip into the coverage of New England cable news.  We apologize for the language we inadvertently aired during what was a mix-up of communications  on their part.  I hate Brian Williams.  On their part.  On their part.  Mind you.  Quick to apologize, though.  My God.  Language.  Oh, God. 
[01:28:30]  What a smug twat he is.  He's smug.  Well, they picked a fortuitous time.  Fortuitous.  Fucking shut up.  Mr. Potato Head face.  His face is all weirdly thrown together quickly.  I like Mr. Potato Head.  His face looks like there was a bunch of white mud pies thrown against the wall quickly.  Dumb fucking face.  Do you like when he dips into comedy?  I can't stand him.  I met him once.  He was cunty.  I'll never fucking love him.  But he's a regular guy.  Yeah.  He's just a regular guy that just happens to give us the news. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, come on.  He's a regular Joe.  He's a douche.  And he dips into comedy every once in a while.  Regular guy.  He goes on fucking, what, Letterman?  Yeah, and he just loosens his tie.  He's like, wait a minute.  That's the stiff fucking news guy.  But look how he's being.  This is the same fucking guy.  Holy shit.  He's being just like a guy that would be hanging in my man cave drinking a few brewskis.  That's right.  He's a man dude.  Or a dude man.  Or what the fuck.  Dude bro.  Bro man.  Why can't we get that right, Sam?  Is it a dude bro man? 
[01:29:30]  Or man bro dude?  Well.  I forget.  I really didn't.  Dude bro.  Dude bro.  Just dude bro.  Okay, it is dude bro.  All right.  Get Nicole in here.  You want to talk to Nicole?  No, no, no.  She was Nicole.  She was scary Friday.  She was pretty fucking scary.  She came on the average show.  She was, believe it or not, fighting with her husband.  She'll figure it out.  Do they find a lot?  Yeah, every now and then.  Well, you know what?  Fucking 15 years of marriage.  You got to really work at it at that point.  A week.  What?  A week after Jess and me. 
[01:30:00]  So that's.  Oh, how long?  Eight months.  Oh, eight months.  Oh, they've only been married eight months.  Oh, that's different.  When did you get married?  June.  Oh, less than eight.  Okay.  Congratulations.  Oh, you were there.  Oh.  You gave the DJ your tie.  Mm-hmm.  She was a lovely girl.  Or the DJ gave you his tie.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  The DJ had to give you his tie and it didn't fit.  That's right.  I didn't have a tie.  It's embarrassing.  Then the DJ had about 30 of them in his car.  All ugly, by the way.  What would you say? 
[01:30:30]  I know you listen.  I picked one that almost looked okay.  I was so depressed.  He had so many ugly ties.  He was so excited that Opie needed to use his tie.  Oh, I forgot my tie.  Oh.  Anyway, so Brian Williams is terrific.  Brian Williams' daughter is really hot, right?  How old is she?  No, that's impossible.  What?  Really?  Look her up.  Isn't she on Girls or something?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's on that Girls show?  Allison. 
[01:31:00]  Allison Williams?  Let me see.  Allison.  Allison.  Ooh.  She's not really hot.  Not really hot.  She's cute, man.  Yeah, but she's not really hot.  Well, that's not a good picture.  Get a fucking good picture.  How old is she?  Uh, 42.  What?  Oh, okay.  She's really hot.  She's better there.  Yeah, that's a nice one right there.  Yeah.  I take back what I said about her father.  He has good cum.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But more with the language.  So scared that a curse word is going to get broadcasted. 
[01:31:30]  Curses.  Look out.  But fucking, you know, showing complete terror is okay.  I don't get it.  It's so dumb.  When are they going to rewrite the rules with that shit?  The rules.  Blood and complete terror, okay.  Saying fuck or shit on NBC, not okay.  That's so stupid.  And we all know it's stupid.  That's our way here in America.  And you got the dumb FCC saying, it's okay that Ortiz said fucking.  Oh, fuck yourself.  How about you rewrite the rules?  You're out of touch. 
[01:32:00]  Anyway, the Boston Bombers family speaks out.  Oh, we haven't even fucking talked about the uncle.  How great was he?  Well, the aunt was even better, I think.  Do you got the uncle?  He's on there.  The original uncle shit?  Yeah.  It's the wacky family.  It's the press conference thing with all the mics around him.  I thought that was pretty good radio when he was talking, just doing that interview  and just saying, like, you know, they should be, they were bad.  I thought it was a very kind of honest.  The uncle was incredibly honest.  Yeah, I liked him a lot. 
[01:32:30]  You begged for their forgiveness.  Yeah, he was going off.  And what was the line about AOL?  I went on the, not, he didn't even say I went on the internet.  I turned on the internet.  How did he say it again?  Do we have his whole speech?  Turn on the internet.  You want to just play his whole speech?  Yeah, let's get a little bit of it.  See how it goes.  He was pretty amazing.  And obviously he had no contact with the boys for a number of years, it seems like.  It looks like there's some kind of falling out within the family itself or something. 
[01:33:00]  Because the last time this uncle saw the brothers, they were a lot younger.  We have heard directly from the uncle who lived.  First, the only purpose here is just to deliver our condolences and to share grief with the real victims here.  Those who have been murdered, those who have been injured.  This boy, this Chinese girl, this young, 29 years old, a girl, I don't remember Casey. 
[01:33:30]  I've just been following this.  I've been following it from day one, but never ever would imagine that somehow the children of my brother would be associated with that.  So it is atrocity.  Where devastated were shocked.  And again, I don't know.  This family does not know how to share that grief with the real victims. 
[01:34:00]  When was the last time you saw them?  I don't know.  We've not been in touch with that family for a number of years.  For a number of years, for, pardon me?  No, they never lived here.  Man, he's angry.  He's the angry uncle.  No.  What happened to the audio?  They never lived here. 
[01:34:30]  When's the last time you saw them?  The last time I saw them was 2006.  That was, I'm sorry, December 2005.  Did you ever know them to have any ill will?  That could be a day off.  No, no, no.  I never knew, even if I had a guess or something, I would just submit them myself.  What do you think provoked this?  Um, being losers, hatred to those who were able to settle themselves, these are the only 
[01:35:00]  reasons I can imagine of.  Anything else, anything else to do with religion, with Islam, it's a fraud, it's a fake.  Did they have any military training at all?  No.  No, as much, again, I've seen them when they were kids.  And any experience, they've gotten the sort of...  I don't know.  Sir, we've seen them on in 2005.  Sir, are you Muslims?  Huh?  Are you Muslims?  Is your family all over the place? 
[01:35:30]  We're Muslims, we're Chechens, we're ethnic Chechens.  Do you have any kids with us?  Do you think they got radicalized with any of the Muslims in that area?  If that happened, most likely somebody radicalized them.  But it's not my brother who just moved back to Rajah, who spent his life bringing bread to the  table.  Fixing cars, fixing cars.  He didn't have time or chance or anything, option.  He's been working.  That's it. 
[01:36:00]  Can you move closer to the Mike's?  Hold on.  Can you get him closer to the...  No, no, no.  I've not been...  Can you move up?  Oh, my God.  I've not been in touch with my brother.  No, I don't know anything about that.  Have you had children work though?  No, my family, it has nothing to do with that family.  What do you think of that?  Are you really being able to talk to them?  Pardon me?  Are you ashamed by what has unfolded in Boston?  Of course, we're ashamed.  Are you ashamed?  Yes, we're ashamed.  They're children of my brother.  One of them... 
[01:36:30]  Who had little influence of them.  Honestly, as much as I know, who had little influence of them.  Is there any reason why you haven't had any contact with me?  I'm following all of them.  It's a personal...  It's a personal...  I didn't like...  So I just...  There's a lot of emotion right there from the uncle of the young...  Then why are you talking?  Oh, my God.  Let him go.  Oh, God.  George Stephanopoulos.  What a twat.  David Turley was there at that press conference.  More important.  So a lot of intensity there, David.  Why are you talking?  Holy fuck.  There's nothing you can do that's better than this. 
[01:37:00]  George Stephanopoulos fucking sucks.  Why wouldn't you just listen to him talk?  Because he's an asshole.  I mean, I want the part about the AOL.  Yeah.  What an asshole.  Go back.  I gotta see how they handle this.  God, they just suck.  That's why nobody cares about fucking TV anymore.  It stinks.  Why did he have to pop on?  He offered nothing.  You don't even understand great TV when it's unfolding in front of your eyes.  Who gives a fuck if the uncle talks for three hours? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, what, do you get a commercial you gotta get to, you fucking asshole?  Are you kidding me?  This runs on its own here.  You're fine.  Sometimes you just know.  Sometimes you just know.  Can you hit play?  What is stupid Diane Sawyer gonna add to this?  Nothing.  Nothing.  They just have to be a part of it.  Bombing, of course, one still on the loose.  David Curley, ABC's David Curley, was there at that press conference.  Saw a lot of intensity there, David.  Yeah, really, George, it was almost bordering on anger.  I think he's just very, very angry that his nephews are implicated in suspects. 
[01:38:00]  What self-serving fucking cunts the press are.  He talked at the end of that news conference that you didn't hear.  He was asked about what he thinks about America, and he spoke very glowingly and proud about being in America.  Why didn't we hear that in America?  This guy's adding nothing.  The father of the two suspects, who apparently is back in Russia now, he said his brother.  Oh, the news.  They just trip over themselves constantly.  They are the fucking worst.  And they're dopes, because people went to the internet to check out the father's entire speech. 
[01:38:30]  It was way better than anything you could have.  Yeah, the second they cut him off, people just punched out to get the asshole.  Who the fuck wants to hear Stephanopoulos and this jerk-off summarizing when the guy's talking?  Right.  You have to do a phoner to interject yourselves into it?  But you interjected nothing.  We don't need you to summarize, you dopey twat.  Oh, unbelievable.  They're fucking hateable.  They really are.  I really hate Stephanopoulos, but I just think he's a smug cunt.  Well, they've got to put their own stamp on everything.  Everything has to be stamped by them. 
[01:39:00]  What the fuck?  Ugh.  Unbelievable.  Terrible.  I want to hear about the AOL.  AOL.  Yes, they were raised with linen napkins, real silverware, and magnetic trays.  I got a clip from the uncle.  Did you ever know them to have any ill will towards the United States?  No.  No.  No.  I never knew.  Even if I had a guess or something, I would just submit them myself. 
[01:39:30]  What do you think provoked this?  Being losers, hatred to those who were able to settle themselves, these are the only reasons  I can imagine of.  Anything else, anything else to do with religion, with Islam, it's a fraud.  It's a fake.  All right.  Yeah, we got that clip.  Hold on, this one.  He's a little rambunctious. 
[01:40:00]  Again, the only, I say, what I think was behind it, being losers, not being able to settle  themselves, and thereby just hating everyone who did.  Wow.  Yes.  Where's the AOL?  I was George Stephanopoulos to summarize what I just heard.  Yeah, right?  I don't understand it.  You know, they're kicking ass in the morning ratings, though, that ABC.  Being losers.  They're kicking Matt Lauer's ass.  So they're doing something right, but I can't be bothered with that nonsense. 
[01:40:30]  They're going to suck a dick.  What kind of dick?  A big, fat dick.  Got to go hairy, right?  Big, fat, hairy dick.  Dick.  That was what really made that insulting.  Not just suck a dick.  It had to be a big, fat, hairy dick.  It's like a big, fat, hairy dick.  Wow.  Yeah.  But yeah, I like the part where it says, turn yourself in and ask for forgiveness from these 
[01:41:00]  people.  Yeah, that'll work.  But, um...  And then the other problem with this whole thing, obviously you said it's like a media  frenzy, but all these assholes are trying to get their question, and he's already answering  someone else's question, and he's giving great TV, but everyone else is so fucking me,  me, me that they're shouting their questions.  Yeah.  And messing up the whole fucking thing.  Yeah, it turned into a feeding frenzy.  Because they're all trying to justify their jobs. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  They all have to get their own voice there and their own question.  You hear what I ask?  Right, exactly.  Like, are you ashamed at what happened?  Like, what kind of question is it?  It's a non-question.  Yeah.  Who cares if he is?  Yeah.  What does that mean?  You heard him say he was ashamed.  You should have answered like Billy Bivitt.  No, I'm not.  And I started punching his penis.  Well, we got the dad speaking out.  Oh, yeah?  Dad's coming to America.  This family would make a hell of a reality show, right? 
[01:42:00]  With the aunt.  Do we have the aunt?  I swear to you, that's the one thing out of all this.  I have not seen the aunt yet.  Well, the aunt is great.  And who's she married to?  That guy?  I don't know.  But she's fucking.  So she's what?  The brother's father's sister?  I'm not even sure.  Or married into the family.  There she is.  I did not see her.  Everything was perfect.  Because Anzor is a very loving and soft-hearted father. 
[01:42:30]  That's why I don't know what will happen to him now when he hears this.  But apparently, even when I hear, like, you know, Anzor said this and that, I don't believe Anzor said that.  Who that said is his wife.  I don't believe that Anzor is even able to speak now.  As much as I know my brother, he would not be able to speak over the phone hearing this news. 
[01:43:00]  Where is he now?  He is in Mahajkala.  Mahajkala.  He had to stay also.  She joined him a few months ago.  Because they were going back and forth.  Very nice.  I mean, his wife was going back and forth.  Because they wanted their daughters to stay in their marriage.  As I said, two daughters, both have children.  We've got to get some of the highlights from her.  I did not see her at all.  She said she thinks it's a plot. 
[01:43:30]  Some kind of a fucking government thingy.  Like Alex Jones says.  False flag.  False flag operation.  Black ops.  False flag.  Black ops.  Black helicopters.  Oh, yeah.  Conspiracy.  Here's the dad.  Someone framed them.  I don't know who exactly did it, but someone did.  And being cowards, they shot the boy dead.  There are cops like this.  When you try calling the younger one, the phone is off? 
[01:44:00]  All phones are switched off.  I can't even get through to my brothers.  One of them is a great lawyer, and I can't get through to him.  I want to get more information.  Those are my kids.  You understand?  I'm afraid for my other boy.  Maybe he will be shot dead, too.  They will say, well, he had weapons.  Kids with weapons?  You don't find weapons in a garbage dump?  What?  I have nothing more to say.  It's all because I'm afraid for my son and his life.  They should arrest him, maybe, and bring him, but alive.  Alive. 
[01:44:30]  And justice should decide who's right and who is guilty.  I like the emotion.  Oh, the translator.  The translator.  Alive.  Alive.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  You know, the father I get.  You know, you don't want to believe your fucking son's did that shit.  Well, of course.  Plus where he's from.  Yeah.  You got to give him some leeway there.  Yeah.  Fucking Chechen.  Chechenian.  I was shocked that it was radical Islam, though.  Yeah, very.  I mean, good thing I didn't jump to conclusions.  No, no. 
[01:45:00]  No, I found I could meander to conclusions and get to the same place.  Just slowly waltzed to conclusions.  Obama told us not to jump to those conclusions.  Yes.  Wow.  Well, we got some Obama talking, and we have the North Dakota news anchor.  Remember, everyone's talking about this dummy today.  Oh, did you see the catfish from the fan of the show?  That self-cutter girl?  No.  That you were talking about?  39-year-old guy from fucking...  Of course it's a guy.  From Michigan. 
[01:45:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  What are you talking about?  Michigan.  What?  Or from Georgia.  Self-cutting girl?  Remember that girl?  She was supposed to be some 15-year-old that was really smart and clever and online.  I think you said you quoted...  I've retweeted her on Twitter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I blocked that fucking guy.  I knew that was a guy.  Oh, I don't know.  I just retweeted some shit that I thought was cool, that's all.  It was a dude.  Yeah, of course.  No doubt that was a dude.  How'd you find out?  Some guy...  Wait, I'm out of this one.  I have no idea what you guys are talking about. 
[01:46:00]  I just retweeted someone that had good shit.  Just a person on Twitter who would pop up.  It sounds like you guys know more about this person than I am.  Oh, yeah.  That person's been a fan of the show.  Yeah, right.  Retweeting a lot of stuff, talking about the show stuff and things like that.  But it turns out that it's a guy.  It's some guy from...  Because I guess another guy on Twitter sent an investigator to find out...  Wait, I don't know what's going on.  Did this guy bother you too?  No, no. 
[01:46:30]  It was just a fan of the show.  Oh.  Just for over a year.  Oh.  Just a fan of the show.  Always kind of in the circles of the fans talking.  Right, right.  They had this whole identity.  They were like...  The person had stories.  They were doing this in high school.  Oh, yeah.  It was a whole personality and problems and questions and all kinds of things.  The dude had gotten into some random girl's photo bucket.  Yeah.  Who took a whole bunch of pictures of herself all the time.  And so he would just take those photos and was able to just update this life. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  As the other girl, totally unaware, updated her actual life.  Right, right.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So, yeah, this one guy, I guess...  Why did that guy send out an investigator?  I don't know.  I heard from somebody.  I am so lost.  You guys obviously are onto someone I have no idea about.  Well, I guess...  Because somebody called me last night who prefers to remain nameless.  Because...  Wait, can you take us to the beginning?  For real.  Yeah, so there's this person...  I think people out there are lost as well.  They're not in the... 
[01:47:30]  No, there isn't really...  In the heart.  There's not much to tell about it.  It's a person, self-cutter girl.  Right.  That was on Twitter.  Who I'd absolutely have retweeted.  Yeah, we were all retweeting.  That person's stuff.  And they had good stuff, especially about the Boston bombing.  Well, yeah, that's just it.  Okay.  It seemed a little suspect that somebody who's supposed to be so young had so much insight  on things.  Right.  But presented herself as a fan of the show.  Okay.  You know?  And then yesterday, Sam texted me with this story. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  There's obviously a whole thing going on that I had no idea about.  Some dude randomly called me.  Right.  Who I knew.  Last night.  This all went down.  Last night.  Right.  Because he had seen all of us retweeting this person.  Oh, okay.  And he goes, yeah.  Well, why weren't you retweeting?  Did you have a problem with this person?  No, I don't think I knew she was supposed to be 15.  I just knew it was a guy.  I can always tell.  And it's just one of these Twitter creeps that just drives me nuts. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, I didn't.  I was just like, if someone has a good tweet, I'm just going to try to push it forward.  That's all I was thinking.  Yeah, I don't remember why I knew, but I was just irritated.  I think I blocked.  All right, all right.  Yeah.  But he had this whole fake identity thing going for a year or more, and now it's the whole  Twitter account's been deleted.  But I want to know why the guy sent out an investigator.  Yeah, I don't know.  But this guy who called me and told me, did this whole thing happen, sent out an investigator.  That's how he got all this information, and is now going to send the FBI and stuff. 
[01:49:00]  She was supposed to, she, he, whatever, she was supposed to help this guy at some kind  of a show?  Yeah, business related.  Business related.  Yeah.  Because I remember seeing that tweet.  Yes.  So I guess that's when he decided, maybe I should check and see what the fuck the deal  is with this person.  Right.  And in finding out, found out it's a 39-year-old from Georgia that has a wife and a kid.  You said Michigan, do you mean Georgia?  Georgia.  The actual pictures that he was using is of a girl, Alyssa, that lives in Michigan. 
[01:49:30]  Oh.  How old is she?  That said that she was, I don't know, she's been like, I guess, graduated from high school.  I think so.  Yeah, yeah.  But there's like these little things, like when you start, because then the guy, when  he called me, he, and I didn't really know, I wasn't involved, but he saw me retweeting.  And so he sent the Facebook account that this dude was using, and he said, look, just compare  it to the photos on Twitter.  And like, I started looking, and he had posted photos as if he were her, but when you look, 
[01:50:00]  you can see on the original one, the original girl's last name is in the photo on like a piece  of paper.  Oh, yeah.  And then in the photo that's on Twitter, nobody really noticed that the last name was  blacked out.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  It's so weird.  There's a lot of creepy people on Twitter.  What a fucking scumbag.  It's a fucking...  Twitter has made me realize there are a lot of creepy people out there, a lot of psychopaths,  just insane people, obsessed people.  It's...  I never realized the extent of all this. 
[01:50:30]  It's crazy.  We've been in the public eye a huge chunk of our lives.  I had no idea the amount of creeps and weirdos and psychopaths there are out there.  There's a girl...  People that just obsess about you that you don't even have any connection with or don't  even know who they are or what their faces look like.  There's a girl that was friends with this girl that, like, unloaded pretty much her  entire life as, like, a friend to this girl for over a year. 
[01:51:00]  Well, that was the thing.  I could tell when, like...  And it was to a creepy fucking 40-year-old guy that is getting this information from a  young girl about her life and problems and things like that, and then just turns out  to not be real.  When I was getting app mentions from her, there were other people attached, and you  could see this whole conversation was happening.  Yeah.  This dude had set up this Twitter account.  He had this whole network of online friends.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, dozens of people who thought it was this 16-year-old girl or whatever. 
[01:51:30]  It's a catfish.  It's a fucking complete catfish.  And it wasn't even like he was trying to convince dudes that he...  No, no.  Like, he was making friends.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't even realize the amount of catfishing that goes on.  I thought that whole catfish movie, which, you know, led to the fucking TV show, I thought  that was one of those weird, rare things.  No, it's happening like crazy.  You'll learn that, yeah, a lot of people are all in on that.  And apparently this guy has a daughter of his own, from what I hear.  Whoa.  I don't know 100%.  And he's playing a fucking teen girl online. 
[01:52:00]  Does an investigator involve?  For what reason?  Well, this guy who called me started to get suspicious and hired a private investigator.  But why would he hire a private investigator?  What problem did he have with the guy?  Was he trying to fuck her?  No, no.  I think that the guy was going to have some kind of, like, let this girl help him at  some kind of a trade show thing.  Right, it was a business-related thing.  Yeah, so in that fact, I guess he decided, well, I better check out who this is and if 
[01:52:30]  there's any issues beforehand.  Because there was some kind of, like, eBay transaction where some names...  Right, right, right.  So it's like, ah, I better...  So he's like, wait, before I get into business...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ah, no.  That's the story I was telling.  Nah, there's...  Do you think that...  Nah, there's a different story there.  Do you think the guy was trying to fuck her and she was supposed to be underage?  Because I didn't remember thinking she was 15.  I remember thinking she was, like, a 19, 20-year-old chick.  She never sounded like a 15-year-old.  No way.  Yeah.  No, there was just too much...  There's something else there.  I mean, I...  He probably got scared shitless because maybe... 
[01:53:00]  Maybe the self-cutting girl...  You don't reference old episodes of Mannix if you're fucking a teen girl.  But I don't believe that that is why he got a private investigator, but I...  Well, I do remember.  I honestly have no idea.  You think he wanted to find out because there might have been some other intentions?  But I do remember...  Or he started getting scared because of their conversation, maybe, um...  I don't know.  I do remember hearing her, or not hearing, but reading her say that she's gonna help him  out at a trade show.  Yeah.  Like, I read that on Twitter, and then that was maybe a week ago or something, and then 
[01:53:30]  he must have decided, well, if there's some kind of business thing, you know, I don't know.  There's a whole world out there, I don't know.  Oh, it's just...  I had no idea.  I asked...  I mean, this dude said he didn't have anything to worry about.  He was just letting people know that he had seen Twitter, so...  And I don't even think that's illegal, what the guy was doing, so...  No, he's...  Yeah, there isn't, like, an investigation going on like that.  It's just weird. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  It's fucking weird.  Like, it's one thing to pop on and fuck with people and troll and things like that, but  if you spend over a year building a whole nother life of a teen girl, that's fucking  weird, man.  It's like, it's not just, like, flirting with people, but also making platonic friends  and business relationships.  Friends.  Friends with girls.  Yeah.  Letting them, like, fucking unload their problems on you.  Talking about your, like, girly problems. 
[01:54:30]  It just was weird.  What the fuck?  There's some fucked up people out there.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll take a break and get in a few other things before Chris Columbus comes in today.  Oh, that's impossible.  Chris Columbus.  What?  That's big.  That's very big, Sam.  Adventures in babysitting.  Yep.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  Really?  Good job, Sam Roberts.  Good job. 
[01:55:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  With Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Continues.  Well, we can talk about the North Dakota news anchor. 
[01:55:30]  We've got to see the video, though, right?  Should we just play the video?  Of what?  North Dakota news anchor.  Sure.  This is the video today, although I don't think, you know, CNN, Fox, and MSNBC will be  able to play it.  It is the viral video today, though.  Yes.  Did you hear the story behind it?  No.  Yes.  This was this guy's first day on the job.  Oh, I knew that.  Yes.  And so he was tweeting out, like, during the afternoon, I just put my tape in, you know, 
[01:56:00]  let's see how this goes.  And then right after this broadcast, he sent out a tweet that said, that couldn't have gone  worse.  That couldn't have gone worse.  I heard he got suspended.  Yeah.  His first day on the job.  New record.  And he got suspended.  Yeah.  Gotta be.  And he was even, besides the flub, horrible.  He was so bad.  Yeah.  His fucking, where is that?  North Dakota.  Yeah, they're not really getting the prime anchors. 
[01:56:30]  Is it local, local North Dakota?  Or was it, you know, attached to an affiliate, all that shit?  I think it was an affiliate.  Because, like, Long Island has News 12.  I mean, oof.  I think it's an NBC affiliate.  They're pretty rough over there as well, so.  That's what I'm asking.  Okay.  Yeah, no, I think it's an affiliate.  So it's attached to a bigger corporate entity.  He stinks.  He's like the boom goes the dynamite kid.  Oh, man.  Right?  Here it is.  This is great.  NBC.  Dream's in Motion organization has a fun time for the disabled. 
[01:57:00]  A deadly avalanche kills five in Colorado.  You're watching the evening Sunday on NBC North Dakota News.  Your news.  Was that the anchor?  That was him.  That was him?  Yeah, yeah.  He's horrendous.  This is horrible.  This is horrible.  This sounds fake.  What are they trying to say, money?  Is it, yeah, is it fake?  I don't think it's fake.  Oh, no.  I also saw the follow-up clip.  Are we getting trolled?  She apologizes.  Yeah, the apology.  No, this is real.  This is real.  Yeah, I'm quite sure it's real.  Who thought this guy was ready to be on TV? 
[01:57:30]  I don't know.  I'm sure she'll get fucking.  That delivery was horrendous.  I think the news director who hired this guy is going to get the boot, too.  Wow.  What are you, an idiot?  All right.  North Dakota News, your news leader in high definition.  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening.  I'm Dan.  What?  He's looking down at his copy, right?  The other female anchor is to his right, and they go to the shot of both of them.  He's looking down at his desk at the papers, and he's like, gay fucking shit. 
[01:58:00]  Like, you can't.  What's wrong with him?  It's his first day.  All those words are wrong.  But why was he bothered?  I was just reading the copy, and he was like, oh.  It's gay.  Fucking shit.  Gay fucking shit.  I would just never say those words when you're behind a news desk.  Right.  Just in case.  Someone has to throw it out there.  You sure this is real?  Yeah.  I'm quite sure it's real.  How would it not be real?  But why would he be so bothered on his first day as a fucking idiot? 
[01:58:30]  As an anchor.  He's a moron.  And his first words are gay fucking shit.  He didn't know he was on the air.  Go back.  How could it be fake?  You know?  Yeah, I don't think it's fake.  No, no, no.  I thought it was when I first heard the audio, but now seeing it, I don't.  Right.  They'd have to have a whole news set and everything.  Yeah, right.  I know.  Now I think it's real.  It's an elaborate hoax.  Go back again so we can hear the gay.  And then I want to hear how they handle it.  And it's not, it's off somebody who like taped it off TV or something.  Right.  Sunday on NBC North Dakota News, your news leader in high definition. 
[01:59:00]  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening.  I'm Dan Q.  You may have seen our newest from AJ on NBC North Dakota News.  Why is he still mumbling to himself?  He's still mumbling to himself.  What the fuck is he doing?  He doesn't even understand his mic is live even though he's not talking.  Here's what I think.  What the fuck's going on?  First of all, he's an adult.  Second, I think he probably thinks they're tight on her. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  And she's introing the news.  Right.  So he's next to her, doesn't know his mic is live.  He's all fucked up just looking at the copy going.  Like he's trying to read through it.  Right.  Get ready.  Like he's actually trying to, you can hear him.  He's mouthing out what is on his copy.  Amazing.  And she's completely distracted because he's mumbling.  Did you say fucking shit?  Yeah.  You said fucking shit.  Now you're mumbling.  Did you say gay fucking shit a minute ago?  And then when he takes the first story, he's horrid. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Go back again.  Yeah.  I want to hear the mumbling too.  The mumbling can be better than the cursing.  I didn't hear the mumbling the first time.  And then if you want to hang on too, which, what's the worst part about this whole clip,  even worse than the cursing, is when she asks him to tell us a little about himself.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  It's so embarrassing.  Yeah.  Gay.  Fucking shit.  Good evening.  I'm Van Tew.  You may have seen our newest from AJ on seeing North Dakota news.  And he'll be joining the Weekend News team as my co-anchor. 
[02:00:30]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ.  Thanks, Van.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University.  And I'm used to, you know, from being from the East Coast.  Get the fuck out of here.  Who hired this guy?  Here's what happened.  You can see it.  I'm finally picking this apart.  Yeah.  He's mumbling, right?  Right.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  The way his head snaps up, his fucking ear came alive with someone going, you're on.  You're on, idiot. 
[02:01:00]  What the fuck are you doing?  What are you doing?  You're on.  You're on live TV.  Yeah.  And you're saying shit and fuck and mumbling.  He looks up and then completely loses anything.  He can't even say, he can't even tell people where he's from.  She said, tell us about yourself just to tell him you're on the air, you asshole.  Look how his head snaps up.  Go back and.  Go all the way back.  I can watch this another ten times.  Go all the way back.  To the gay fucking shit.  Gay fucking shit.  Because that shit, she's out of her mind, too.  Oh, gay fucking shit.  Well, you know what that is?  The question might have been, which shit tastes better? 
[02:01:30]  Gay fucking shit.  First day on the job.  On NBC North Dakota News, your news leader in high definition.  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening.  I'm Van Tew.  You may have seen our newest, AJ, on, seeing North Dakota News.  And he'll be joining the Weekend News team as my co-anchor.  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ.  See you right there.  Thanks, Van.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University. 
[02:02:00]  And I'm used to, you know, from being from the East Coast.  I love when he looks at her, because it's like an acknowledgement that I won't be finishing  this sentence, so move on.  Yeah, yeah, just move on.  What a disaster.  It's been great co-hosting the news with you, because it's over.  Could he get fired, do you think?  That would be hilarious.  Yes, he's so fired.  Already.  Yes, he's already suspended. 
[02:02:30]  But I would keep him on now.  I would have him on every night.  He's so fired.  He's a fat-tied idiot.  He really is a dummy.  Can we hear the part where he tells her a little...  A little about himself.  A little something about himself.  I love it.  Because he's trying to talk, but his mind is just going, oh my god.  I just said, you fucking shouldn't tell any fucking shit my first day at work.  Yeah, but he's a dope already, though.  Yeah.  But that's all he's hearing in his mind. 
[02:03:00]  He was a dope before he said any of this stuff.  Yeah.  Where we're taking it from is the part where his head bounces up and goes, who?  Huh?  Uh-oh.  Like, what?  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ.  Thanks, man.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University, and I'm used to, you know, from being from  the East Coast.  Okay, well, welcome aboard.  You see the big gulp he takes after that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I'm used to being from the East Coast.  Where does it go after this? 
[02:03:30]  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yeah, this is...  Now he's ready to start the story.  Now he's going to start the news like none of this happened.  That was fantastic.  A great way to introduce the new anchor to the fucking locals.  Great intro.  Perfect.  Got their attention.  That was a fine.  How do you do?  This is textbook.  Textbook.  This is how every news anchor should be introduced.  All the old women in North Dakota that are sitting at home on a Saturday night watching  the news are just like, oh, he's like my grandson.  That's right.  All right, now I know him, so he's allowed to give me the news.  He's charming.  He's charming. 
[02:04:00]  And now he delivers the news so horribly, and I'm not sure if he's just plain awful or  if he's so fucked up right now.  Probably a combo of balls.  It's a combo of balls.  He's terrible, but his mind right now cannot concentrate on the news.  He's like, oh my God, I said gay fucking shit.  There's a fucking man in his brain running around with a bullhorn yelling, gay fucking  shit.  You said gay fucking shit.  And now the stories today.  Gay fucking shit. 
[02:04:30]  Well, we have a...  Gay fucking shit.  There's traffic.  You said gay fucking shit.  There's traffic at I-95.  Gay fucking shit.  You said it.  You said it on news.  You said it on news.  You said it on work.  Live fucking television.  They're calling for rain.  Gay fucking shit.  Tomorrow, they said that it might not rain.  All right.  Let's hear how the transition between telling us a little about himself, and then we'll just  go right into the...  He'll redeem himself here.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  AJ.  Thanks.  Go for it.  A fatal ATV crash happened yesterday in Williams County.  Officers say Kevin George rolled with his ATV while turning from Canal to 151st Street.  George was thrown from his vehicle.  He was not wearing a helmet and pronounced dead at Mercy Medical Hospital in Wollaston.  Runners participated in the London Marathon today, less than a week after the bombings.  Athletes paid tribute to the victims of the bombings with a 30-second moment of silence  observed before the start of the men's elite race and the... 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Is he fucking bumbling through?  Look at the...  Wow.  Did he look at the wrong camera, too?  Yeah.  I'm getting a tweet.  He's saying that about the piece on handicapped children.  Is that...  The gay fucking shit.  I thought he was reading some copy and thought, gay fucking shit, but who knows?  Oh, he's so done.  And you know, as he's reading that, he's like, can I just stop now?  Do I really have to finish the broadcast?  Yeah.  Can I just walk off?  He wants to go home.  I'm just going to skulk off and wait for fucking Tosh to call for a web redemption. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  That's about it.  That's in his future.  Oh, yeah.  Hopefully I can print down some t-shirts that say gay fucking shit on them.  Gay fucking shit.  I'm going to remix this.  I got his Twitter.  Did he get his Twitter?  No.  I mean, just the tweets that I told you about.  Yeah, fuck it.  Go to Clemente AJ.  Clemente.  Clemente.  Oh, someone's saying...  C-L-E-M-E-N-T-E-A-J.  Someone's saying they thought he just didn't like the intro? 
[02:06:30]  Thought it was gay fucking shit?  I don't know.  What was the intro?  Well, I don't know if we'll ever get into his head.  Go back to his...  Let's hear the intro.  Oh, I know what fuck...  She said to him, what is that on your dick?  Oh, gay fucking shit.  Dreams in Motion organization has a fun time for the disabled.  A deadly avalanche kills five in Colorado.  You're watching The Evening Sunday on NBC North Dakota News.  Your news leader in high definition. 
[02:07:00]  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening, I'm gay, dude.  You may have seen art.  And then he said gay again.  He goes, gay fucking shit.  Gay.  And then he's...  Huh?  Just...  It's one of the best clips to come around in a long fucking time.  Could we...  I have to.  Yeah.  Can we just play it once all the way through without stopping?  Sure.  Okay.  It's almost impossible.  I know.  We'll try.  I just have to hear the whole thing. 
[02:07:30]  You want the news afterwards, too?  Yes.  Okay.  The whole clip.  This is how it went down.  I love that.  Dreams in Motion organization has a fun time for the disabled.  A deadly avalanche kills five in Colorado.  You're watching The Evening Sunday on NBC North Dakota News.  Can I get that again?  Can I get this thing?  Anvalanche?  Look, we can't do it.  It's too funny.  No, we're trying.  He said anvalanche?  I got to get that anvalanche.  Wait.  You know what, Sam? 
[02:08:00]  You got to make a list.  Okay.  Because I think I have a new favorite part of the clip.  All right.  But you got to make a...  You have to make a list so we can get through this clip.  And Sam will write everything down that was wrong with this.  Oh, boy.  Right now, my favorite part is just the...  That it starts with.  Because it's like, this is the real news.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  And he's sitting there.  Oh.  His Twitter's terrific, by the way.  Real job.  His Twitter is terrific.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Is he talking about it at all?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  He's trying to defend himself.  Oh, boy.  Should we get to that now, or should we get through the clip? 
[02:08:30]  No, let's get through the clip and try to write a quick list for everybody, too.  All right?  All right.  All right.  The Dreams in Motion organization has a fun time for the disabled.  A deadly avalanche kills five in Colorado.  You're watching the evening Sunday on NBC North Dakota News, your news leader in high definition.  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening.  I'm Van Tew.  You may have seen our news from AJ on NBC North Dakota News, and he'll be joining the 
[02:09:00]  Weekend News team as my co-anchor.  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ.  She's swallowed.  Thanks, Van.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University, and I'm used to, you know, from being from  the East Coast.  Okay.  Well, welcome aboard, AJ.  From being from the East Coast.  Go for it.  Wait.  I want to point one thing out.  I want to stop before.  The fun part is listening to her start the news, and in her mind, she's saying, did I 
[02:09:30]  just hear gay fucking shit on the news that I'm on?  It's easy.  She can't fucking continue.  She knows it's his first day, and she's, did he just say gay fucking shit?  And she gulps.  She, you hear that?  Up.  Oh, they are both two dry-mouthed motherfuckers at this point.  Okay.  Gay fucking shit.  An avalanche.  Kevin George rolled with his ATV while turning from Canal to 151st Street.  George was thrown from his vehicle.  He was not wearing a helmet and pronounced dead at Mercy Medical Hospital in Wollaston. 
[02:10:00]  Runners participated in the London Marathon today, less than a week after the bombings.  Athletes paid tribute to the victims of the bombings with a 30-second moment of silence  observed before the start of the men's elite race and the match.  Okay, so here's my list.  All right.  And you guys tell me if I'm missing anything.  Sure.  I'm happy to add.  The news music.  That's horrible.  That's where it starts.  Yeah.  Then he says an avalanche.  An avalanche.  Then he says gay fucking shit. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  Then he mumbles gay a couple more times.  Then the co-anchor gets interrupted and she gulps.  Yes.  Then he gives a look as if to say, ooh, ooh.  Then he informs everybody that he's used to, you know, from being from the East Coast.  He used to be, you know.  And then he brings up bombings in London, but doesn't mention that they took place in Boston.  Right.  He just says bombings.  It's the bombings.  Well, I got his Twitter. 
[02:11:00]  What's he saying?  Well, like Sam wrote.  Or says, excuse me.  It starts with, all right, news director and GM checking out my tape that we shot yesterday,  seeing if I'm ready for anchoring.  It's not.  And then his next tweet, that couldn't have gone any worse.  That couldn't have gone any worse.  And then you got one asshole, Chad McMaster writes, keep AJ.  Hashtag keep AJ.  Chad.  So AJ retweeted that, of course. 
[02:11:30]  A little support for his full Paul.  What a guy.  And then AJ writes, tough day.  Thanks for the support.  We all make mistakes.  I'm truly sorry for mine.  I'll try my hardest to come back better and learn from this.  Yeah, we all make mistakes, but some of us do some things that aren't mistakes.  Yeah, yeah.  Nobody only makes mistakes.  First date.  And then at Gene Park writes, gotta ask, did you say gay before FS?  Whatever FS means.  Fucking shit.  Oh, oh, oh, okay. 
[02:12:00]  Full service.  You're looking the same as I am.  Yeah, but why would he say fucking shit?  I'm sorry.  You're right.  I gotta ask, did you say gay before fucking shit?  Because if so, that's way worse than any profanity.  Oh, my gosh.  And so then AJ writes back to Gene Park, says, I did not.  I was trying to pronounce the London Marathon winner's name.  Oh, stop it.  Well, he was.  It doesn't make sense.  The winner's.  That's why I'd be mumbling it the whole time.  Yeah, he's trying to fucking figure out how he's going to say it.  The winner's name is, I don't even know how to say it.  T-S-E-G-A-Y-E. 
[02:12:30]  Maybe it's gay and maybe he's going fucking shit like I can't get this.  Right.  Not gay fucking shit.  Gay fucking shit.  Oh.  Like, Kumi in Norton fucking shit in Norton.  Well, it's a hell of a way to start your broadcast.  You know, your first day of the job, you got a name that's tough to pronounce.  Oh, man.  So he's probably sitting there working it out in his head and he can't figure out how to  say it properly.  Oh, that's why he's mumbling it.  He's mumbling, it's gay, it's gay.  Last name, K-B-E-D or something like that?  K-E-B-E-D-E.  K-B-E-D, maybe.  K-B-E-D-E or something like that? 
[02:13:00]  Well, the gay part is the big gay.  That's the first name.  That's got to be it.  He's like, gay fucking shit.  Fucking shit.  He's like, fuck, how do you say this?  I'm about to go live.  Gay.  And then he's just gay.  Gay.  Yeah, he said, I'm about to go live.  And then somebody goes, no, no, no, you already did.  You're fucking live, dummy.  And then he's just trying to save his career.  He goes, I just want to say that I did not say the word gay.  I was trying to pronounce the London Marathon winner's name and then the name again.  And then finally, I would never disrespect anybody in that matter. 
[02:13:30]  Once again, I'm truly sorry.  That was from three hours ago.  All right.  Well, then let's get past that part and get to the fact that you started a news broadcast  by saying fucking shit.  Yeah.  Forget the gay part.  We'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  I'm a gay part.  Also, Anvalanche.  Yeah, Anvalanche.  I would assume he's one of their reporters and they decided to give him the big fucking gig.  Yeah, because it was the weekend.  It seems like they know him up.  It was the weekend newscast.  They're moving him up.  Wow.  Oh, and then they had a big apology on the 10 o'clock news. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Do I have that?  Yeah.  The same Asian girl that was next to him delivered an apology without AJ standing next to her.  Now she's solo.  She's running solo.  A few hours later, she's just solo.  He got suspended.  Just to put everything into perspective, that couldn't have gone any worse.  His life changed 14 hours ago.  14 hours.  And now he's the laughing stock of the internet.  That's a hell of a day right there.  That's all it takes. 
[02:14:30]  Overnight, he's waking up this morning.  You want to talk about highs and lows all in one day.  All excited to get the big fucking promotion and then, holy crap, I think I'm out of the business.  You're the gay fucking shit guy.  Honey, honey, you're sitting down?  I got the job.  They asked me.  They moved me up.  I'm anchoring.  Yes.  I'm anchoring the news, baby.  It's going to be great.  People say that.  I feel someone was shouting into the Asian lady's ear and it was screwing her up.  No, she was being screwed up because she's like, oh my God. 
[02:15:00]  He's saying gay fucking shit and we're live.  She's hearing the feed.  Yep.  That's why she's fucked up.  Are you sitting down?  I know I told you I got the job, but were you watching?  Gay fucking shit.  I did something terrible.  Well, here she is by herself without AJ a few hours later.  Good evening and thank you for joining us.  I'd like to first start off with an apology on behalf of NBC North Dakota News.  Many of you wrote in after an incident that occurred prior to our newscast. 
[02:15:30]  An incident?  Incident.  This is one where the apology I actually understand.  This is a justified apology.  You don't turn on the news expecting to hear gay fucking shit.  That's how you turn on this show.  What a pleasure that would be to hear on local news.  Prior to our newscast this evening, when one of our employees used profanity on...  I'm not even using his name anymore.  One of our employees.  Oh, God.  One of our employees.  Not even using his name. 
[02:16:00]  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  They're so done with this guy.  To our newscast this evening, when one of our employees used profanity on air.  We were caught off guard and he didn't realize his microphone was on.  And while that is no excuse, we do train our reporters who always assume that any microphone  is live at any time.  Unfortunately, we cannot take back what was said, but we do apologize and hope that you  may forgive us and rest assured that something like this will not happen again. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, there's no guarantee of that.  And if she signs off, she says, back to you, dyke cunt.  You know what's funny?  She said that he assumed his mic is off.  I hope so.  Yeah.  I hope they didn't go to him and go, did you know your mic was on?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Of course I did.  Right, right, right.  I wouldn't have said that if it was off.  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What a dumb, dumb man.  He is a dummy.  He's so stupid.  And we rest assured it won't happen again.  You know how they rest assured?  By not having AJ back as one of the anchors. 
[02:17:00]  The broadcast department at WVU does not.  That's the college that he graduated from.  Yeah, yeah.  Does not look good today.  Not at all.  There's another great clip going around.  The Ryan Lochte clip.  Saw that.  And they've done that before, those two in Philly.  They did it with the Kardashian sisters.  Oh, yeah.  They goof on the.  They goof on the celebrities that come out on their show.  And I guess Ryan, right?  Ryan Lochte.  Ryan Lochte, yeah.  Won a few medals in the Olympics. 
[02:17:30]  He's one of those hunks that they decided to give a reality show to.  And he is almost brain dead in general.  He's almost brain dead.  And they gave him a fucking show.  So he finds himself on the news down there in Philly.  Fox 29.  It's like Good Day Philly or whatever.  It was one of those satellite interviews, you know.  So they're talking to Ryan Lochte about his reality show.  And the news isn't playing the whole clip.  They should.  Because it's hilarious.  Yeah.  It really is.  Just push play on this.  QKC, 11, 11, 831. 
[02:18:00]  Olympic swimmer, not as a hottie, Ryan Lochte.  He is pretty busy these days after capturing our attention during the 2012 Olympics.  He's training for Rio, working on a fashion line.  What?  And guest starring, yes, on shows like 90210.  Not to mention being featured in People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive issue.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, you can see him on his new reality series.  He's disgusted.  What would Ryan Lochte do?  Yeah, he doesn't fuck right.  He doesn't like it.  He doesn't play the game at all.  Check it out.  Welcome to Philadelphia. 
[02:18:30]  Good morning.  Oh, and of course, you get all cute.  Good morning.  Your ties all lose.  Of course.  I'm done.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Well, we have a love connection.  Too bad that my co-anchor, Chanel, is married, Ryan.  This is embarrassing.  No, let's talk about this new show, shall we?  What would Ryan do?  What is the premise?  I mean, not that we shouldn't care what you do, but why should we care?  What are you doing?  What am I not doing?  Okay.  This guy's fucking great.  I think I'm a lot different than any other kind of Olympian. 
[02:19:00]  I mean, when you think of Olympians.  To pick up women.  What did he say?  To pick up women.  I mean, it's not a montage.  Huh?  It looks like a montage.  Whoever did the editing here.  Well, it's all right, because it was a long.  It's still a longer one.  It's a long fucking interview, man.  The show looks good, though.  Yeah, you like it?  Fuck yeah.  The main thing, I mean, yes.  Am I looking for that one true love?  Yes, I am.  No, are you really? 
[02:19:30]  You really are?  Yes, of course I am.  So every woman, like, we keep seeing this video of you,  and this blonde woman,  and not that that's going to help you pinpoint who that person may be.  Well, we're men.  Right.  So every woman you meet, is she trying to be the one?  Come on, tell the truth.  I don't know if she's trying to be the one,  but am I out there looking for the one?  Yes, I am.  Well, if you were a woman coming up to you, this is an odd premise.  What kind of question is this?  No, what would get to you?  What kind of line could somebody say?  What would get your attention? 
[02:20:00]  Okay, fucking shit.  Oh, really?  Good question.  In other words, this is not happening.  All right, so.  This woman has my attention.  We're looking at video of you, and you're out, you're having a good time.  So how are you doing this and training?  You like it?  Fuck yeah.  You know, my philosophy is if you're a man at night,  you've got to be a man in the morning.  So if I go out all night and I go dancing and I'm drinking,  you know what, I still have a job to do,  and I still have a goal to do, which is 2016 Olympics. 
[02:20:30]  Gold to do.  No matter what I did the night before,  I'm still going to wake up in the morning  and be the best swimmer I can be and give it 110%.  I like that.  I have a feeling my co-host, that's what you live by, right?  If you're a man at night, you can't be a man in the morning.  Well, what I do, and I rip my shirt off.  Pretty much.  When I get out of bed.  Do you want to?  If only you can.  The worst is when you pick up a girl, and she's a girl at night,  and then you realize she's a man in the morning. 
[02:21:00]  Two men wake up in the morning.  Yeah.  What happens to that pretty lady?  Fuck a Rylok.  He's hilarious.  You think he's funny?  Fuck yeah, this guy's good.  I think he looks good in a Speedo, you idiot.  This fucking guy's in good shape.  I know this is long, but the payoff is worth it.  Oh, I like this.  Because then they decipher what a dullard, dope, dumb fucking guy that he is.  Which is great to see that happen on, like, morning news TV.  Yeah, because they're usually all fluffy, you know?  Not these two.  Because there's a classic clip with the Kardashian sisters. 
[02:21:30]  They did pretty much the same shit.  But they should do it to his face.  But whatever.  No.  I know it.  That's something I should say.  If only I could look like him.  Well, Ryan, of course, you get this question all the time, and I apologize for it.  Are you dating someone right now?  I am not dating anyone until I'm single.  Well, you just heard him.  He's searching high and low for movies.  Yeah, but you know all these reality shows work sometimes.  So when can we catch a show?  It's going to be at E.  You know it's going to be fun.  The camera.  Is it bothering you to have the cameras following you around everywhere? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Are you getting used to it?  You know, I'm getting used to it.  Yeah.  I mean, the first couple days, it was a little weird.  Yeah.  I mean, I was brushing my teeth, and the camera was there.  And I was like, what are you guys doing?  What the fuck?  Right, Ryan?  They go to the bathroom?  How about the bathroom is off limits?  On reality shows, they follow you into the bathroom?  He's just brushing his teeth.  So you have to tell them what you're doing.  Well, I mean, I guess there's like a mirror with a sink, and then you have the bathroom. 
[02:22:30]  Right.  And he's not going over the area.  Gotcha.  Oh, my God.  I look forward to watching What Would Ryan Do?  He is into water.  Okay, Ryan, good luck to you.  We'll be watching.  All right, here's where it gets good.  The anchors are laughing.  They're laughing uncontrollably.  And then they put a picture.  It's an embarrassing picture of him and a speed-o.  Of him and a speed-o.  Seriously, how are they going to get enough material? 
[02:23:00]  What was the question that stumped him?  What a woman can say?  Oh, what a woman can say?  I guess silence impresses him.  No, it's just a woman couldn't say anything.  He is good-looking.  I need to eat some oatmeal on that.  Seriously, how are they going to put together, like, 22, 13 weeks of programming? 
[02:23:30]  He's so cute.  Oh, he is cute.  Can you see the plaid?  Yeah.  And you should listen to your time like that.  That's sexy.  It really is.  Woo!  What do you say?  I'm a man at night.  What is it?  You know, I'm a man at night and a man in the morning.  They're gooping on him.  They're killing him.  He looks through the camera.  That's right.  The lash is going to come off. 
[02:24:00]  Look out.  We got a lash.  We got a lash off.  Let me tell you about this, you know.  Snorting.  I can't do it.  She's snorting.  We got to go to break.  I can't do it.  Once she starts snorting, we got to take a break.  I had no idea how stupid that guy was.  Oh, yeah.  He's a fucking moron.  Just a dope.  He's a box of rocks.  They loved him.  Oh, yeah?  They were making fun of him.  Did that guy used to be in New York?  He looks familiar, right?  He looks like that guy, right?  When they did the nationally syndicated Fox show, it was Good Day New York, and then it 
[02:24:30]  was like Mike and Molly, some kind of talk show.  Yeah, that was him.  They were trying to go at Regis and Kelly.  Yeah, he's pretty good.  He was on that show.  He's pretty good.  And then he had to explain the bathroom where like, oh, my God, basically separate from  the toilet, I guess is what he was trying to say.  Like, don't worry.  They're not going to get me taking a shit.  And it like took him so long.  He's like, well, there's the sink in the mirror and the other part of the bathroom.  The mirror.  I drop logs. 
[02:25:00]  Sink.  Don't worry.  They're not going to catch me on camera dropping logs.  What else is in a bathroom?  What else did you see?  They're not going to catch me taking a gay fucking shit, right?  Hey, show that picture of him on a beach for a second.  No.  That was hilarious.  Oh, you thought it was...  I mean, Chip, you're just making an excuse to see a man in his fucking speedo.  That's funny?  Yeah.  Look at the dog.  Chip, why are you looking...  Why did you want to look at that?  You're not looking at the dog.  Fuck yeah, I am. 
[02:25:30]  You're looking at his dick in his speedo.  Jesus.  Chip is all fucking...  Chip gay?  Chip's gay.  He might be gay.  Add it to the profile.  Well, no, I'm just saying.  He's fucking got his arms open and stuff.  He's hilarious?  Fucking hilarious.  Just relaxing and stuff.  Ah, Chip.  That's funny.  He tries to fool us.  Oh, look, it's funny.  Oh, yeah, that is funny.  The dog is probably, like, looking right at his privates or something.  Why?  Is that where the funny part is? 
[02:26:00]  Fuck yeah, this is great.  All right, we got Chris Columbus coming in next, so let's clear the field.  I'm waiting for Chris Columbus to show up.  I'm saying 9.30 now. 
[02:26:30]  9.30 for what?  Chris Columbus?  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  What is he promoting?  House of Secrets?  Out tomorrow?  Yeah, it's a book.  Yeah, I know.  He's the Harry Potter dude.  Yeah, I mean, he's more than that.  He didn't write the Harry Potter books, though.  No, that was J.K.  Rawl.  I know, but now he's dipping into that same world trying to get his own fucking Harry Potter thing going, I'm thinking.  He did write Goonies, though.  Yes, he did.  He wrote Goonies.  The screenplay. 
[02:27:00]  And then he directed, like, the Home Alone movies and Mrs. Doubtfire.  No, no, no.  Two of the Harry Potters.  Which two, though?  Chamber of Secrets and the Sorcerer's Stone.  No, he didn't do Sorcerer's Stone.  He did part six.  Harry Potter buys a hat.  A hat?  That was a movie?  Yes, it was.  Magical hat.  Of course, he did Adventures in Babysitting.  All right, well, we'll bring all that up with him when he gets in here.  Percy Jackson and the Olympians, The Lightning Thief. 
[02:27:30]  No.  Young Sherlock Holmes.  I remember that.  I love you, Beth Cooper.  You're just saying that?  Come on.  Don't use this as your personal phone.  Shout out to Beth.  What up?  Telephone.  What up, girl?  Could we play the song, You Rock?  You Got It Now?  Remember this song?  Certainly.  It's about masturbation.  The divinals, right?  It is.  It's so nice.  I want you to love me  When I feel down  I want you above me 
[02:28:00]  I'll search my soul  I want you to find me  I forget myself  I want you to remind me  I don't love anybody else  When I think about you  I touch my soul  I don't love you  Well, she's not going to be touching herself anymore.  Uh-oh.  She's dead.  Oh, no.  What's her name?  You're kidding. 
[02:28:30]  Um, the girl from the divinals.  Yeah, how'd she die?  I don't know.  How did you sing or die?  Pop a picture up there or something.  How old was she?  I just heard she's dead.  Chrissy Amflit.  Was she sexy?  She was kind of sexy back in the day, right?  Was she?  Yeah, she was.  Let me say.  She looked kind of burlesquey, I remember.  Did she?  Well, not in that picture.  Jesus.  Wow.  Well, let's see what she looked like back in...  Yeah, she kind of had that burlesque thing going. 
[02:29:00]  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Looks a little like Shirley Manson there.  Chrissy what?  Chrissy...  Yeah, she's all right.  Blow that up.  Blow a picture up.  I gotta see.  I gotta see if she has to go older than she can.  Yeah.  I don't think she was ever hot.  She was sexy.  I remember this video.  She knew how to work her body.  Her goddamn body.  How old was she, Sam Roberts? 
[02:29:30]  53.  What did she die of, Sam Roberts?  Whoa.  Maybe diabetes.  Wow.  Wow, she got big.  You can't sing I Touch Myself when you're that big.  Oh, maybe she's not that big.  Maybe it's the shirt.  Oh, Chloe.  You can't sing I Touch My Toes when you're that big.  Oh, Jesus.  She's got a breast cancer.  Son of a bitch.  Breast cancer and multiple sclerosis.  Oh, my God.  She couldn't just pick one. 
[02:30:00]  She should have touched herself.  Maybe she could have found...  Way to go, selfish.  Wes.  I know where you're going.  I'm thinking it's like a PSA almost at this point for self-breast exams.  Right.  Touch yourself.  Well, instead of touching herself, she should have squeezed herself a few times.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, that's how you get the...  You know.  How you figure out where the lumps are.  Think about you.  If you just touch yourself, I don't know if you can figure out where the lumps are.  Yeah.  You gotta squeeze a little.  Oh.  Oh, that's the video. 
[02:30:30]  I remember this.  Yeah.  Well, that sucks, man.  Whoa.  And she had big bosoms.  Wow.  What a great video.  Do they have a follow-up hit, these poor sons of bitches?  I don't think so.  Iraq, what's the follow-up to I Touch Myself?  I don't think they had one.  One hit wonder?  That was it for this band.  Oh, Jesus.  They were famous for three and a half minutes.  That's...  Oh, no.  Well, something...  Oh, no.  What?  Well, you could say one hit wonder, but you could also say... 
[02:31:00]  No, no.  Don't say it.  We all know where you're going.  Save yourself.  Save yourself.  I'm not saying a word.  Fucking one hit wonder bread, right, Ant?  That's what I meant.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  Hey, listen.  God, I wanted to say it so bad.  It's so funny.  No, you did.  And since you almost said it, it's all I'm thinking of all day.  I know.  It's terrible.  Oh, God.  You guys hear about Reese Witherspoon? 
[02:31:30]  What happened to Reese Witherspoon?  Well, Reese Witherspoon's husband was driving drunk.  Yeah.  Where, down in Georgia, I think?  Mm-hmm.  They don't play in Georgia.  We know that now.  Especially now with your Hollywood types.  So this guy's swerving all over the fucking place, so they pull him over, and she was  pretty much trying to use the Reese Witherspoon card.  Yeah.  Do you know who I am?  I'm Reese Witherspoon.  I'm Reese Witherspoon.  Do you know who I am?  I'm Reese Witherspoon. 
[02:32:00]  Reese Witherspoon.  She said to the cop, do you know my name?  Yes.  You're Reese Witherspoon.  And the officer answered by saying, no, I don't need to know your name.  Yeah.  And then Reese Witherspoon said, you're about to find out who I am.  You're going to be on national news.  Ah, well, maybe not him, but you will be.  The officer said it would probably be much more humiliating for you than for me.  Exactly.  Did he say that or no?  No.  We should have.  Reese Witherspoon's husband had eyelids that were droopy, and his eyes were bloodshot and 
[02:32:30]  watery.  Yes.  The officer said he smelled a strong odor of alcohol coming from Reese Witherspoon's husband's...  I'm Reese Witherspoon's husband.  My eyes are droopy.  Of course, Reese Witherspoon's husband said he only had one drink.  But he blew a .139.  That's impressive, huh?  .139?  .14?  Eh.  .139. 
[02:33:00]  That's a good night.  But isn't a .8 legally under the influence these days?  What are we down?  A .0...  I mean .0...  .08.  It is .08, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So .139 is pretty impressive.  But it used to be fucking .1.  All right.  You know.  So that's a good...  That's...  You're having a good time.  You're not fucking, you know...  You're not hammered at .139?  No, you're not falling out of the vehicle.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  .08 is nothing, by the way. 
[02:33:30]  That's fucking nothing.  How many drinks is that?  Probably fucking...  With some people, it's probably only two.  Two in an hour?  Yeah.  With somebody...  You know, with E-Rock, it's probably, you know, a keg.  But...  So it's all about the weight, see?  Just more blood.  Reese Witherspoon.  You got it?  A little late?  Oh.  No.  Oh.  I'm still fucking back on the atrocity he was thinking of.  One hit.  One hit wonder.  One hit wonder.  Yeah.  Horrible. 
[02:34:00]  And then Reese Witherspoon put out a statement, because everyone's talking about this.  Out of respect for the ongoing legal situation, I cannot comment on everything that is being  reported right now.  Now, basically, your people are saying, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it looks like Reese Witherspoon has a lot to say and wants to say a lot.  Yeah.  But I don't want to say I clearly...  But I do want to say, excuse me, but I do want to say I clearly had one drink too many,  and I'm deeply embarrassed about the things I said.  Oh, no.  It was definitely a scary situation, and I was frightened for my husband. 
[02:34:30]  It's a scary situation.  But that was no excuse.  I was disrespectful to the officer who was just doing his job.  I have nothing but respect for the police, and I'm very sorry for my behavior.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What's up?  Step out of the vehicle, Reese Witherspoon.  Reese Witherspoon.  Give me your ID.  Reese Witherspoon.  Hi, I'm Reese Witherspoon.  Spewn. 
[02:35:00]  The way she says her fucking name.  You kind of love it.  Yeah.  Man.  There's one other fucking story.  Story.  We have an update on Chris Columbus.  We could certainly break it, get the rest of the live reads out of the way,  and then clear the field for Chris Columbus, but there was something else in here.  Did we want to mention...  Oh, Al Michaels.  That's right.  I knew that we had a two for today.  Wow.  Al Michaels also stopped for DUI over the weekend.  Fuck.  What the hell was he thinking? 
[02:35:30]  Well...  I don't know what these people are thinking.  I do not understand.  You don't trick and drive anymore?  No.  I actually...  I don't know if you want to hear the truth of the whole thing.  I haven't even had anything to drink.  Since...  11 days.  Whoa.  Good.  11 days.  Why?  You feeling all right?  I'm trying to lose weight.  And it's all about my fucking... 
[02:36:00]  I'm just drinking too much.  So I figured...  Give it a rest and fucking lose the weight.  Just give it a rest.  See fucking...  How long it could last.  Yeah.  Just fucking...  Wait, this is like breaking news.  Oh, it's crazy.  Well, the weight Ant needs to lose...  It's called the wreckage of his past.  And he's carrying...  It comes in baggage.  A heavy, heavy burden...  ...that he needs to put down.  That's good, man.  Have you really gone 11 days?  11 fucking days.  And how long do you think you're going to go?  I don't know.  I'm just going to let it ride.  Yeah, just a day at a time. 
[02:36:30]  I'm fine.  The weekends are the hardest, but even that wasn't that bad.  You got the shakes or any of that shit?  No.  It's not that bad.  I just fucking...  Because then you realize, like, all right.  I get a fucking beer or a glass of wine or something like that.  Right.  Or a fucking Captain Coke or whatever.  And then I'm drinking it.  And it feels all good and dandy.  Like, right at the beginning of the night.  But then you're just fucking...  You know, then you're just drinking for the...  It's not really any...  This is uncomfortable.  You don't feel better.  It's not comfortable. 
[02:37:00]  Why?  You just don't feel, like, better the longer you keep drinking at night.  That's right.  And then I wake up.  I got to tell you something.  That waking up without a hangover is fucking amazing.  No kidding, it is.  It is fucking amazing.  I was on time to my brother's house on Sunday.  But they're drinking.  What are you doing when they're drinking?  I was drinking some fucking Pellegrino.  I hope you keep with it.  I hope I'm not speaking out of turn, but...  We'll see.  Yeah, I hope so, too.  I think it's great. 
[02:37:30]  I do have to say that.  As they say, one's too many and a thousand's not enough.  Oh, wow.  Coincidentally, I'm up to 11 days in a row where I am drinking.  Oh, that's good.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Switch rolls.  Oh, God.  So did you have a bad one the night before you decided to?  Or was it?  Not at all.  It was a sickness.  It just is like...  Yeah, yeah.  The cough and cold wasn't helping.  I'm just like...  Well, no, but that made you stop for a couple days just because you wanted to... 
[02:38:00]  I was just like...  Give me this a shot, or is this just one of those things?  I don't know.  I have no expectations.  I'm not fucking...  Yeah, but I'll just fucking...  You know, I kind of do like not waking up feeling like shit.  That's kind of a good thing.  And then the whole thing, like when you think of the process of just like, all right, I'm  out drinking.  It's like, yeah, it just gets redundant.  I don't know.  It becomes the event. 
[02:38:30]  It becomes the thing.  It's almost like when you're doing something, you're not living.  And I know with sex and other things, too.  You just...  That becomes the whole purpose of the weekend or of the night.  And it's like all these other things there are to do that are fun that get obliterated  by that.  And it's...  Yeah, that's great, dude.  I mean, it's so...  You know...  I always...  Can I have your wine collection?  I always handle fucking drinking pretty good, I think.  Can I have your wine collection?  Uh, no. 
[02:39:00]  Damn it!  I still have guests.  But you all feel sick.  That's the best part.  And I feel sick.  It's so nice to fucking wake up in that hangover.  I don't know.  Fucking headaches.  Are you enjoying anything more or less?  No, I hate everything.  Still.  Yeah, it's 11 days.  Oh, the hate's still there.  So it hasn't...  No.  Give it a little time.  The hate's still there.  We thought the hate had something to do with the other thing.  Everyone needs their vice.  Mine's hatred.  Yeah.  Rage.  Yeah.  I wouldn't call it a vice.  I would say it's more of an identity cloak. 
[02:39:30]  A vice.  Cocaine.  Heroin's a vice.  I think...  Uh...  Yeah.  Are they calling you...  Are you...  They're calling you...  They're calling you a faggot.  Anthony's a quitter.  See, I knew.  I knew that was coming in.  I don't fucking want to eat that one.  That's good.  I'll come to the house soon.  Fucking...  We'll sit and have some Diet Cokes.  Come to the house.  Come to the house.  Have some fucking Diet Cokes.  You know what's good?  Impressive.  Just have some fucking... 
[02:40:00]  Like, uh...  Club soda with...  With fucking, uh...  Cranberry in it.  Ooh, that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll go...  Maybe I'll get on pills.  Yeah.  A little pot, man.  Just to chill out.  Yeah, I'll pop a molly.  Or what about some...  Scissor?  Some scissor...  Maybe you could have some of that.  Or do you have to have alcohol in your...  No, there's no...  There's generally no alcohol in...  In scissor?  Codeine.  Doesn't have alcohol.  Well. 
[02:40:30]  So you're...  And Jolly Ranchers?  Jolly Ranchers, yeah, at the bottom.  Yeah.  You mean to tell me when you put a full-size Velociraptor in your backyard, you were sober?  Oh, fuck, why aren't we talking about this?  Don't call sober.  You're sober.  When I got a Velociraptor from my yard.  Where the fuck did you get that?  From...  Is this online?  You could just get fucking dinosaurs?  Yeah, it's a full-size Velociraptor.  Is it a Velociraptor?  No.  It's made out of a Jurassic Park.  It's...  Can we see the picture?  It looks amazing.  It's like fiberglass. 
[02:41:00]  And it's all nicely painted and everything.  For what?  It's very detailed.  For what?  Jimmy says.  It's by the jacuzzi, so when all the bushes grow really nice, like, it'll look like  it's, ah, peeking out over the jacuzzi.  Right.  It looks cool.  It's like a lawn ornament.  No?  Chris Columbus in studio.  Ah, Chris Columbus.  Welcome aboard.  Take a seat, sir.  We'll get back to your...  Take a seat.  We're just learning that Anthony here...  I got a Velociraptor.  He just got a dinosaur for his backyard. 
[02:41:30]  A real dinosaur.  Well, it's a lifestyle Velociraptor.  It might as well be a real one.  Is it a piece of shrubbery or something?  It's like a lawn ornament.  Oh, okay.  But it's life-size.  It's like five feet tall.  Oh, okay.  So it's really...  It looks more than five feet tall.  Badass.  It might be a little taller than five feet, but it's pretty cool.  It's like an actual size of what they were, and it's in my backyard now.  It looks very festive.  Thank you, sir.  So that's what you walked...  Thank you.  I was just...  That's what you walked into.  That's all.  Yeah, we were just...  We wanted to make you feel comfortable.  I feel comfortable.  I like this studio.  Yeah.  It's nice and small and intimate. 
[02:42:00]  I had a larger one, but, you know...  We had a massive studio.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, you, you know, you pawed through your resume.  There's quite a few motion pictures that people have enjoyed over the years.  Oh, thank you.  I gotta tell you.  Yeah, it's a little shocking when I look at it.  I try to forget about a lot of it just so you can continue to move forward.  But, yeah, it's kind of nice.  What was the first one that you were like, wow, I think I'm on my way here?  It was actually Gremlins.  Gremlins.  Gremlins was written in a New York City loft here because I had a bunch of mice that I  was actually worried were going to chew off my fingers at night. 
[02:42:30]  And I thought, these little monsters are kind of scary.  I wrote the script, sent it out to 50 producers and studios.  No one picked it up.  Steven Spielberg was leaving, I think, on a Friday afternoon, saw it sitting on top of  his desk, picked it up, and read it.  Come on.  No.  I know.  I believe you, but I have to just say that.  When I get a call, I'm 22 years old, I get a call on 26th Street here, my roommate answers  and says, Chris, it's Steven Spielberg.  And I'm like, yeah, bullshit.  That's not Steven Spielberg.  Exactly.  And it was, asking me to come out to L.A. to meet with him. 
[02:43:00]  And so that was, as Paul Newman said, it's sometimes about luck, you know, and it was  kind of, that was a lucky moment for me.  Yeah.  That kind of settled it.  Have you ever gotten to talk to the people that turned it down?  I'm sure.  They would never admit it.  You know, it's typical Hollywood.  They're not going to admit it.  Right.  Yeah, they screwed up there.  That was your first hit.  That was your first hit.  What were you doing right before that?  I did a horrible movie called Reckless, which was written, it was sort of my love letter  to Bruce Springsteen and the fact that I grew up in a fact, in Youngstown, Ohio, in a factory  town, and the director turned it into Last Tango in Weirton, West Virginia. 
[02:43:30]  Oh.  I remember sitting there, these are high school kids, and they're having sex brilliantly,  which, by the way, doesn't exist in high school.  Sex usually, for most of us.  Very awkward.  But they're having this, and my agent turns to me during the screening, and I'm practically  crying because this guy destroyed my film.  Oh, shit.  And my agent turns to me and says, Academy Award nomination.  And I said, are you out of your fucking mind?  This is horrible.  So, yeah, that was a disaster before Kremlin. 
[02:44:00]  But I got a follow-up question.  So you know that was a good script in your own head, right?  Right.  And now that you're this famous, why not just try to really, you know, make it your vision?  You mean that script?  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, I'll try to get back there.  Or, you know, those kind of films have, they're difficult to get fined.  Because it sounds like you really believe that he destroyed your vision and messed it up.  He wouldn't let me on the set.  That's how much he destroyed my vision.  Wow.  But you remember, that's my first movie, so.  But you've got to prove everyone wrong and redo it now.  Yeah.  Well, I kind of, you know, I don't have that anger about that anymore because Gremlins came 
[02:44:30]  immediately afterwards, so that was okay.  All right.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  You did Only the Lonely, too.  You just wrote that?  I wrote it and directed it.  No.  Okay.  Did you have John Candy in mind for that, or did you not write it for you?  I met John because John came in on Home Alone.  We were doing Home Alone, and we needed a guy to play the polka guy, Gus Polinsky.  And John came in, and we shot 24 hours with John.  We literally shot 24 hours, all of his scenes in that movie.  Wow.  And John and I just hit it off.  So I wrote Only the Lonely initially for an Italian guy, and then I changed it to an 
[02:45:00]  Irish-American family and got Maureen O'Hara back into the film business.  And John was maybe the nicest guy who ever lived.  Funniest guy I've ever met.  Truly hilarious, but also one of the sweetest guys in the world.  One of his best performances.  Not a lot of people saw that movie.  I agree.  I thought it was with Ali Sheedy.  I thought it was fucking fantastic.  I thought he was very underrated as an actor, like his serious moments and the things he  did that were non-comedic, those moments, he was fantastic.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, he was great to work with.  Yeah, he was amazing.  What made you, being a writer, what made you say, like, eh, I could direct, too? 
[02:45:30]  That was the, you know, I was drilled into my head at NYU that you have to write in order  to become a director.  This was before the age of independent films, so for me it was like, they told me that if  you write enough screenplays and they're successful and they get made, you can also become  a director.  So when I wanted to, I don't like sit, what's that?  I guess it worked.  It worked.  I just didn't like sitting in a room.  It felt so lonely just being in a room for 12 hours writing.  And I did it for a long, I did it until I could direct it.  What was the first movie you directed? 
[02:46:00]  Adventures in Babyship.  Okay, that was Adventures in Babyship.  Did you feel, did you feel vulnerable?  Did you feel like, oh my God, are people going to listen to me?  Were you a hard ass or were you kind of, eh?  The first day I thought I was going to get fired.  Really?  That's how a lot of directors say that.  Yeah, I still feel, when I get onto the set, honest to God, I still feel like I'm going  to get fired.  Still, still.  It's still, it's that thing that haunts you, it's with you forever.  So those first three days on Adventures in Babysitting, I thought, they're going to see  that I'm this big phony.  Because I walked onto the set that first day, I'll never forget. 
[02:46:30]  And I've been preparing for this moment for years, and it was, oh my God, what am I, what  the fuck am I going to do?  I forgot everything I had learned.  And then I had to, you know, it took about five minutes to get out of that.  Yeah.  But yeah, that was a terrifying moment, but it was a fun movie to do because I got to  work with some great people like Albert Collins, you know, the blues thing.  Yeah, of course.  But it's not always translatable.  Like, Stephen King writes, he's a genius writer, but when he gets into the screenplay  aspect of it, it just doesn't work. 
[02:47:00]  Like, for some reason, his visions of his work is not as good as, like, Kubrick's vision  of his work.  If you look at Maximum Overdrive in comparison with Shawshank, you know, he wrote both of  them, right?  I was just going to bring up Maximum Overdrive.  I'm glad you did.  That was called Trucks, I think.  Yeah, that was a short story.  It was Trucks and Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption was the short story.  Yeah.  I'm boring everyone, myself included.  I'm sure there's a lot of listeners who know Rita Hayworth.  Yeah, I'm sure. 
[02:47:30]  Maybe there's a few.  You never know.  They probably made a good move changing the title and shortening it to just Shawshank Redemption.  It's just my opinion.  Good, good, good, good move there, Jim.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I just wanted to commend you.  I didn't mean to pitch you against Stephen King.  But I didn't do a movie about mad trucks, right?  No, I like the fact that you're able to translate into directly.  It's not easy.  It's just because I was my upset.  I really wanted to do it.  And you went the whole route with going to school and...  I went to NYU.  Yeah, I went to NYU, lived here for 17 years, and then moved out to San Francisco, did a picture, 
[02:48:00]  and kind of fell in love with that city and moved my family there.  It was Mrs. Doubtfire.  So I really...  Mrs. Doubtfire, yeah, yeah.  A little film called Mrs. Doubtfire.  You directed that?  Yeah, I directed it, yeah.  Which was an exercise in documentary filmmaking.  Because Robin, at his most energetic and manic, would do two or three scripted takes and then would veer off.  So we had two or three cameras on at all times.  Because the other actors never had any idea what he was doing.  And the first time I edited a film electronically, we shot over a million feet of film. 
[02:48:30]  And we had everything from the G-rated version to the NC-17 rated version of the film.  So that was a great experience, but a grueling experience.  Was anybody able to kind of...  Because he really is brilliantly...  When he's going off on a weird tangent, was anybody able to kind of keep up with him and go with the scene?  Or did he kind of lose everybody?  Every actor...  Remember, I had pros.  I talked to the actors beforehand.  So I had Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan, and they were really able to keep up with him.  It was exhausting for them, though, as well.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:49:00]  You never knew what was going to come out of his mouth, and you never...  He never repeated it.  So the script supervisor was like scribbling madly.  Oh, Christ, right.  She was sweating.  I thought she was going to have a heart attack.  Keep up with him, you know.  He's a really good actor.  Like, I love his serious acting.  Even though Miss Doubtfire was brilliant in that.  But I like his acting more than I ever did his stand-up.  He was great in Good Will Hunting.  He's a great actor.  Yeah.  And he'll continue to do some great films, yeah.  I heard he made so much money off Good Will Hunting because he had an amazing back-end deal 
[02:49:30]  that when his next bonus was about to kick in, that they had to just pull it out of the theater  because it would have been too expensive.  Seriously?  Oh, please.  Like, if they kept it in the theater, he would have had to hit another...  Or something like that.  I forget where I read that, but I was like...  Because he made that movie, you know.  Because Matt Damon and Ben Affleck weren't known at that time.  So is the fact that Robin won the Oscar for it.  Right.  He made that movie a lot of money.  That's a good...  Just a little background on the name.  My name?  On your name, yeah.  My father... 
[02:50:00]  Sounds familiar?  Yeah.  Sounds familiar.  Brings a bell.  Let me tell you something.  My father...  My father who grew...  You know, he was in a coal mining community, had 12 kids, right?  In his family, Italian-American.  Italian immigrants.  Back then, when the woman had a baby, she'd go into the hospital.  So, bam, she's out.  Drugs.  He's out drinking.  He comes back to the hospital.  Names the kid either Christopher or Christina, based on the sex of the baby.  Grandmother gets up, changes the name. 
[02:50:30]  I'm born.  My dad says, it's a long lost wish of your grandfather to be named Christopher.  So I get the name.  Now, some people think I'm an asshole.  Like, I've changed my name to this.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  Do you think that I would actually change my name to Chris Columbus?  Like, and I want to be considered a serious filmmaker?  Right, right.  Jesus, like changing your name to Barney Fyfe.  I was like, this is ridiculous.  This is not going to happen.  So I...  Yeah, I just...  But I didn't want to be a jerk and change my name.  So I kept it.  So that's how it existed.  And, you know, there's nothing I can do about it. 
[02:51:00]  You should actually put a T at the end and call yourself Christ Columbus.  You know, that's something Bono would do.  And your novel, a book.  A book that initially...  In 1999, I wrote the first 90 pages of a screenplay called Stones of Time, not House of Secrets.  And by the time I got to page 90, it was a $500 million movie.  So I put it in a drawer and went off to do the Potter films. 
[02:51:30]  Came back four years later.  You know, I couldn't get the idea out of my head.  Looked at the manuscript again.  Maybe a television series.  And again, too expensive.  Wow, yeah.  But I really couldn't get the idea out of my head.  And about two years, two and a half years ago, I thought, maybe a novel.  But I don't want to...  I couldn't lock myself in a room for a year and a half and ignore the film business.  So I found this co-writer, a guy named Ned Vizzini.  He's a brilliant young writer.  I gave him the first 90 pages, said, see if there's something here.  A week later, he sent me the first chapter, the first eight pages of the novel. 
[02:52:00]  I liked it.  I rewrote it, sent it back to him, bounced it back and forth.  Kind of as a hobby, before we knew it, we had 100 pages.  Wow.  And we took it to a publisher.  Now it's in 12 to 14 languages or something.  Wow.  It's very exciting.  And people are like, well, is it like Harry Potter?  Well, it's got a little of that in it.  But it's mostly a thematic sequel to The Goonies.  Because all these years...  And I didn't take it...  When The Goonies was released, I didn't take it that seriously. 
[02:52:30]  I liked the movie.  But I was more of a fan of Gremlins.  I'm like, I kind of like Gremlins a little better.  And I was into young Sherlock Holmes, which I was writing at the time.  So I kind of ignored The Goonies.  And then once I got to London, all these 23-year-olds are coming up to me on the set saying,  you know what movie changed my life, mate?  And I'm like, Home Alone.  They're like, The Goonies.  And it didn't stop.  Then I started getting all these letters about The Goonies.  It became more than a cult.  People were becoming obsessed with it.  And they're like, when is there going to be a sequel? 
[02:53:00]  And I said, they're 35 years old.  It would be a sad fucking sequel to have these 35-year-olds on bikes looking for treasure.  So I was like, I can't do that.  So I said, this House of Secrets takes the spirit of The Goonies,  but gives these three kids a brand new adventure to go on.  By the way, I disagree.  I think 35-year-olds on a bike looking for treasure would be an amazing thing.  That would be awesome.  All right, I'll start writing answers.  A little more tragic, though.  That would be kind of...  Yeah, because you build in some kind of a great backstory. 
[02:53:30]  Like, you know what I mean?  None of them are allowed to drive because of DUIs.  They're all confined to the same neighborhood because of Megan's Law.  Just a phenomenal backstory looking for treasure.  So why would it have been a $500 million movie if you just saw where it was going?  Yeah, the effects were just too incredibly outrageous.  Now, of course, since visual effects are getting a little cheaper,  there's a possibility it can be a movie someday, but we'll see.  It will be a movie someday.  There's a great endorsement by J.K. Rowling, 
[02:54:00]  which is really probably not easy to get on a book.  No, it's extremely difficult.  But I know her pretty well,  and I sent her the book just to get advice on it.  And she came back and said,  you've got to slow down the pace a little,  add some more character stuff.  Oh, wow.  And so we took that to heart,  and then a couple of weeks later,  she sent me this quote, which was really...  So she actually read the book.  It's weird.  You figure a lot of people wouldn't take the time to read it  when they're worried about their own, I guess,  multi-trillion-dollar franchise.  Certainly, you know,  most studio executives these days won't read anything over four pages. 
[02:54:30]  So I don't know if they're going to ever read this.  But, yeah, she read it.  She loved it.  And was the advice she gave you was good?  It was good.  You know, we were working at such a fast pace  that we had missed certain things in the book,  and we went back and fixed those things.  What were the character development things?  Character development things, dialogue things,  some logic things, yeah.  I always think it's odd when you have a franchise of a movie  and different directors direct different installments of it.  What did you think of the ones,  the Harry Potters that you didn't direct?  You know, it was interesting. 
[02:55:00]  At the time, it was not a, you know,  at the time we had sort of the weight of the world on our shoulders.  And I'm not saying that.  There were some big expectations.  That's the, you know, as a filmmaker,  you are, everybody's looking at you like,  who are you going to cast?  Who's going to, you know,  what is Quidditch going to look like?  Those are the kind of things that were on my mind for a long time.  We were making the first movie.  So the first movie was not a barrel of fun.  And, you know, we were really, because if we screwed that up,  there would be no second Harry Potter movie. 
[02:55:30]  And it was too expensive,  and we would have torpedoed the whole series.  I wasn't thinking about that every day,  or else I probably would have never left my house.  Yeah, really.  Man.  So that was a little intense.  Once the first movie came out on a Friday,  and we realized that it was successful,  that Monday we started shooting the second movie.  So it was that quick.  Wow, wow.  But literally, the second movie then became a lot of fun,  and became, even though it was a darker film,  for me, a lighter experience.  You just know that, yeah, hey, we're off and running. 
[02:56:00]  We're okay.  People have responded to it.  People like the movie.  So that was good.  And then, you know, there were two movies,  160 days each for me, back to back.  And I thought I was going to direct all seven.  I thought, oh, I have unlimited energy.  Not the case.  I was, you know, physically and mentally, I was exhausted.  I could barely put two words together after finishing the first movie.  So were you supposed to do the third?  Yeah, I was going to do the third.  And you just tapped out.  Steve Clovis said to me, you've got to read Prisoner of Azkaban.  It's my best script.  I said, Steve, there's no way I can do this.  You know, I've got to see my kids again before they're, you know, 
[02:56:30]  they're driving me around.  Can you imagine tapping out of the Harry Potter series?  It's amazing to me.  And I produced the third one.  I produced the third.  You were still in, but.  Yeah, I was there.  You know, that way I could work eight hours a day as opposed to 16.  Right.  Wow.  I'm sorry, were you able to get you,  creatively you had some kind of input, though, in that one?  Every day, yeah.  We had input on who was going to be cast, and yeah, it was.  Just the day-to-day.  But I did like, you know, Joe, J.K. Rowling's idea,  her concept was constantly to make these films darker and darker.  We knew when we first met and talked about it 
[02:57:00]  that each book was going to get darker.  So that, we set that into motion initially, you know,  with the first two movies.  The second movie's a little darker, a little more desaturated in color.  Third movie gets a little darker.  So, yeah, I've been very impressed by what the other directors have done,  and particularly impressed by how great the kids have become as actors, you know.  Were you part of all seven in the end?  No.  So you were done after three?  After three, I moved back to the States, yeah.  Direct two and produced the third.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  A lot of your movies, too, there's that youthful theme 
[02:57:30]  that goes through a lot of your screenplays and whatnot.  Are you kind of in a state of arrested development throughout your life?  I probably, you know, I'm still, you know, that's the problem.  I still have the heart of a 10-year-old and the mind of a 10-year-old boy,  which can get you into trouble at times.  But I just, you know, I love that particular side of filmmaking.  I love to sort of create those things that kids will, you know,  be able to watch for 20 years.  That, on the other hand, you know, we did a picture called The Help a couple of years ago 
[02:58:00]  that really opened up, for me as a filmmaker,  seeing that it's possible to make a film that is, you know, about character  and about conflict and about something sort of deep,  and audiences showed up.  That's kind of rare.  It's not Transformers.  It was The Help.  So I thought, well, there's still, and then this year you get inspired by movies like Argo  and Beasts of the Southern Wild and movies that people are actually going to see,  and maybe the business is changing a little bit.  Maybe people are getting a little tired of that. 
[02:58:30]  So House of Secrets is the stuff I've always been doing,  but I get to do that as a book.  And then from a film perspective, hopefully I'll have a career like Clint Eastwood.  You know, as Clint was doing movies about fighting chimpanzees 20 years ago,  now he's one of the greatest living directors.  So I'm, you know, I'm still hungry.  I've got, you know, I really have about 20 years left, I hope, of making some good movies.  Yeah.  What, is there any genre that you haven't really gone into directing-wise that you want to?  Well, you know, I didn't direct The Help, but I was on the set.  You know, I promised Spielberg I'd be there every day because it was a first-time director, 
[02:59:00]  so I was on the set every day.  I had to promise him I wouldn't.  Oh, boy.  Good setup.  Yeah, right?  But, yeah, so I was, yeah, there's a lot of genres, but it depends on the movie.  The movie has to be great.  I've gotten myself into trouble when I, because I get to that point where I get very anxious about directing.  I want to get back on the set.  It's just in my blood.  So if a good script doesn't come along in about 16 months or two years, I'll end up doing, 
[02:59:30]  and that's why I did a movie like I Love You, Beth Cooper, which is not a movie I'm particularly proud of.  We had a director, David O. Russell, was going to direct it.  Suddenly he dropped out at the last minute.  The studio called me and said, why don't you just do this?  It'll be fun.  It'll be a lark.  And I'm like, all right, I'll do it.  And I did it.  But you've got to not do it.  You've got to be patient and say, I'm not doing it.  You've got to know a studio is bullshitting when a studio says something will be a lark.  That's not studio language.  No, it'll be fun.  It's like sitting at poker and tossing so many hands in. 
[03:00:00]  After a while, you're just like, I've got to play something.  Right.  You know, I'm tired of folding the whole time.  Exactly.  But now I have to be patient.  So I will be patient before I decide what I'm going to direct next.  Who's your favorite director when you're growing up?  Who do you look at and go, I wish I could do one thing as good as him?  I think it was, you know, I grew up, God, I grew up in the 70s.  So I got to see some pretty great directors.  You know, Sidney Lumet was one of the guys who I think is probably almost my favorite.  Francis Ford Coppola, Scorsese, all the guys from the 70s.  Did you ever see Q&A by Lumet?  Yeah, it was good.  So many people haven't seen it with Nick Nolte. 
[03:00:30]  It was a great movie.  So many people.  That's Nick Nolte's best thing.  He plays a big tranny-loving Irish cop with a mustache.  And he's wearing lifts the whole time.  It's fucking fantastic.  You really write a nice synopsis there, Jim.  I'm pleased.  I felt like I was watching a fucking home movie.  Strandy-loving Irish cop?  Well, without the cop part.  But, yeah, Sidney Lumet's great.  How about Kubrick?  Do you like Kubrick?  I like Kubrick.  You don't love him, though?  I don't love him.  I love Paths of Glory.  I like movies that are emotional and have a, you know, but I do like him. 
[03:01:00]  You feel like he was overrated or are you just not like his style?  No, no, not overrated.  I just, I respond to emotional directors.  I love David Lean.  I love Howard Hawks.  I love Frank Capra.  I love Spielberg.  And I like Kubrick.  But I think Kubrick's best films are his earlier films.  I like Clockwork Orange.  I like, and I really do love Paths of Glory.  Paths of Glory is one of the most emotionally devastating anti-war films I've ever seen.  I don't know.  I've saw it years ago.  Is it Kirk Douglas?  Kirk Douglas, yeah.  It's awesome.  I haven't seen that in many, many years.  It's intense.  It's only 90 minutes. 
[03:01:30]  It's great.  Which is the one, there's one of the old Kubrick movies where the bartender from The Shining,  the guy who played Lloyd in The Shining was in it, and I was like, he likes to reuse,  like the father from Clockwork Orange was also in The Shining.  He liked to reuse people.  Yeah, I don't know that guy.  I don't know why I would ask about him.  Yeah.  There's no reason for me to ask about a guy that had one scene in 1980.  She was trying to sell a book, and I'm like, what about that guy that did one thing 42 years ago?  Are you a director that a lot of takes, or you like getting it done pretty quickly? 
[03:02:00]  Well, after the Doubtfire experience, I like getting it done quickly.  Done pretty quickly, yeah.  You know, Robin is an exception.  I'll do whatever I can to, but yeah, I like these days two or three takes.  Yeah?  Definitely, yeah.  You get frustrated if, uh...  Well, it's the Eastwood.  Eastwood does, you know, I worked with crew guys who said Eastwood would do one take,  and the cameraman would say, Clint, we panned a light, and the sound man, and he goes,  I don't care, move on.  So he'd, you know, I don't think I'm there, where I would just go, move forward.  Well, a gentleman of his size would move a while back then. 
[03:02:30]  But two or three takes is good.  Yeah.  So Eastwood's one of those guys that just wants to get it done, and he kind of knows.  I think Jay Moore said that about him, like he knows when he wants it.  Yeah, Jay Moore has good stories on him, yeah.  He knows when he has it.  Two takes, and he knows, and the actors are prepared, so that's why he gets such good performances,  because the actors know they only got two shots.  Yeah, they only got two shots.  Every actor will say, can I have a fifth, or a sixth, or a seventh.  If you indulge them, you never know what you have.  Yeah.  And plus it's Eastwood.  You don't want to look like an asshole if you're not Clint Eastwood,  because I don't think there's any actor... 
[03:03:00]  Like, are there actors, I mean, even though you're the director,  there's got to be some actors that if you're working with,  you're a little tentative around because of their...  Like, if you were working around a De Niro or a Pacino, or no?  Oh, God, yeah.  You know, I was doing a...  I had to talk to De Niro about a movie that we were potentially going to do about a year ago,  and his assistant said to me, just...  Bob loves to talk on the phone.  Just call him.  And I'm like, can't I just email him?  I don't really want to call Bob De Niro.  I'm like...  He's like, no, no, call him.  He loves to talk.  So I was dying, because it was De Niro. 
[03:03:30]  It was raging full.  You were hoping for the machine to pick up?  Yeah.  And he's just like, hello.  Hi, Chris.  But he was the nicest guy in the world, but I had to call him about five or six times,  and each time, I couldn't get all of those performances out of my head.  You know, it's hard to...  I think Pacino would be somebody like that as well, you know?  It's...  And Clint Eastwood would certainly be the most intimidating guy in the world.  But for him, I don't think there's any actors that he would have that reaction.  Like, that's probably why they know not to fuck around,  because it's like, there's no actor that's going to alpha male Clint Eastwood on his set. 
[03:04:00]  Well, that's a good thing about being that old,  is you've outlived everyone else.  So you're dealing with a bunch of young guys who aren't going to go up against you, you know?  Yeah, they probably all look up to him.  Yeah, exactly.  See, that's why I'm good with Hollywood people,  because I know all the inside stuff.  Clint Eastwood's popular.  Did you, early on, did you write or direct any episodic television?  No, I never did.  You never did TV?  Never did any television.  Do you look at that like, thanks?  No.  Not at all.  Particularly today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Back in the day, yeah, it was probably when I was 20, I thought... 
[03:04:30]  Wouldn't want to do a love boat?  Yeah, back then it was love boat now.  But now, you know, TV is almost better than the movies.  Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, things like that, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I got here last night and I ran straight to the apartment and watched Game of Thrones.  Game of Thrones, yeah.  So I just, you know, I'm obsessed with that stuff.  I'm two weeks behind.  Oh, so I won't tell you what happened.  Yeah, please don't.  Yeah, but it really is amazing how many great things there are now on cable.  On regular TV, not too many.  Yeah, it's amazing stuff you can't get at movies.  Was it a conscious decision not to write or direct for television early? 
[03:05:00]  Because, I mean, a lot of directors did start, even Spielberg, you know, with the Night Gallery and things like that.  You know, I just had somebody who drilled it into my head, you have to write movies.  You have to write movies.  Really?  You know, and back then, movies were, that was it.  You know, television was not great back then.  No.  Except for Saturday Night Live, you know.  Maybe Hill Street Blues or something.  But now, like I said, it's a renaissance of television.  When you're writing a film, because I've written little things before, like scripts and stuff, but not a film script. 
[03:05:30]  Ransom letters.  Yeah.  It's just, do you have an idea of what your beginning, middle, and end is going to be?  Like, okay, this is kind of where I want to go.  Or will you just go, this is a good idea.  I hope I find something that doesn't suck to end it with.  Or do you kind of see the whole thing first?  There's so much that sucks.  And I have drawers of things that suck.  Me too, I'm wearing them.  But, yeah, you have to take the shot. 
[03:06:00]  And sometimes you get 30 or 40 pages into something, and you're like, this is the worst thing I've ever read.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, but you just have to do it.  You've got to take the shot.  But there are also people who will tell you not to do certain things.  I remember when I had the idea for Gremlins, every one of my friends said, God, you're such an asshole.  That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.  And you have to break through all that.  Same thing with Mrs. Doubtfire.  I had people saying, are you out of your mind?  Really?  That's horrible.  And you just have to see, you know, that there's anything. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's ballsy to not get like, all right, Gary, you're right, this sucks.  Right.  I wish someone would have said that about Bicentennial Man.  I never saw Bicentennial Man.  Did you not like the way it came out?  It was kind of a, not a great movie.  You know, there's certain movies I've done, and I've been knocking that movie for a while.  But it's really because we got, you get into it for the wrong reason.  Like I said earlier, I was, Robin and I had just done Mrs. Doubtfire, and he did a great cameo in nine months.  And we're talking, and we said, we should work together again.  It'd be fun. 
[03:07:00]  There's a script, Bicentennial Man.  The script was not ready.  We said, well, we'll do it anyway.  We get into the middle of it, and there's a whole boatload of issues and problems with the material.  So I avoided that pitfall again as well.  Oh, okay.  Does he not like it either?  Oh, Robin busts, you know, in his stand-up.  He'll always bring out Bicentennial Man.  I think I was first, though.  I'll take credit for being the first guy to jump on that movie.  But I like the guy who will criticize his own stuff, because then you know it's genuine.  You say that you like something.  You have to be a dick to come, to really, honestly, and there are a lot of them in Hollywood. 
[03:07:30]  A guy who would say, well, you know, I love all of them like they're my babies.  Well, they're not really your babies.  Some of them are, you know.  Yeah, somebody else's babies.  Somebody else's babies that you don't want to see, yeah.  Someone screwed this one up.  Are you a, like, technical, modern guy with a computer, or do you use a pen still?  I'll do, I'm doing something on E Street Radio later, and I had to, you know,  I did all that longhand.  And when I write, you know, but when I was writing the book, it was all computer. 
[03:08:00]  It was all emailing back and forth.  The writer and I have only met each other five times in person.  Isn't that amazing how that's gotten to where you can just exchange ideas instantly like that?  A lot of musicians do that, too.  You just take a file, send it to somebody, they throw it in the studio,  lay down guitar tracks to it, send it off to the next guy,  and you could get an entire song done, an album done, without the band ever meeting.  It's kind of amazing, you know.  I mean, Ned and I, we said at the outset, it's kind of, it's not the Clint Eastwood thing, certainly,  but I've been, you know, I'm 20 years older than my co-writer, 
[03:08:30]  and he, again, is a Goonies fan and loves all that stuff.  And I said to him, look, if I send you a chapter, feel free to edit it, cut dialogue, do whatever you want.  There's no ego about it, and you should feel the same way about what I do to your stuff.  Now, don't be concerned about that.  And we had a good relationship.  There were never any fights, you know.  Wow, yeah.  See, I find collaboration to be so hard.  Like, I hate when people change my work.  Like, it's really, like, you know what I mean?  I don't know how you do that.  I admire the ability to do that, because that's a much better way to work creatively. 
[03:09:00]  It's just a matter.  You have to do it in the film business all the time.  I mean, the most important part of a long career in the film business is collaboration.  If you're not collaborative and you're fighting,  you can be a jerk and fight for something that's wrong.  I've seen that happen.  I've seen people fight for a bad idea.  What's the point?  You pick your battle against it, right?  Just because it was their idea.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to pick the ones you're going to fight for.  Yeah, exactly.  I hate when people change.  I don't know why I just said that twice.  Because you really hate it.  I know, but I said it once. 
[03:09:30]  It's not like your ears fell off.  You all heard it.  That's why you re-inforated.  You acknowledged it, and I just had nothing else to say.  So I'm like, always repeat.  That's popular in a conversation.  I'm an idiot.  But the book is called House of Secrets,  and you're obviously a great and prolific writer and worker.  So this is a book I'll read.  We just got this today, or I would have been more prepared.  This is the advanced copy.  You guys should get that.  The hardcover looks cool.  I'm like a book geek and nerd.  And when I got it on my desk,  it's like a nice, solid hardcover with illustrations.  It's really cool.  I like the advanced copy signed, though, 
[03:10:00]  because no one else has that.  Okay.  I'll sign it for you.  I don't sell it.  I just keep it for me.  Of course you do.  He's got a museum at his house.  I really do.  I just show girls.  I'm like, look at this.  She's like, what is that?  I'm like, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, jeez.  Wonderful.  Okay.  Okay.  Good way to wrap things up, Jim.  Yeah, well, you know.  Chris, wow.  This was great, guys.  What a blast.  This was fun.  Thank you, guys.  Really cool.  I think we're done, too, huh?  Yes.  This Saturday night,  I will be at the Moon Tower Festival in Austin performing, 
[03:10:30]  and Friday night,  I'm doing Marin's live podcast in Austin.  Austin, so if you want to see me,  I'll be there.  If not, ignore that.  And I guess we'll see everybody tomorrow.  Chop, chop.  Yes, thanks.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  And now,  the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All right, all right.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  With yours truly,  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number. 
[03:11:00]  Chris Columbus in studio.  That's huge.  That's one of those guys,  I mean,  when you're a kid,  it's just a name.  Like, it's just a name  that's associated with every movie  that's awesome.  You don't know what he does.  You don't know what he looks like.  But he's tagged on to him somehow.  That was abrupt.  And then you get older  and you realize  he's done everything. 
[03:11:30]  I guess,  I don't know.  Eric, do you have a favorite  Chris Columbus movies?  This is a guy  who seems like he'd be  right in your wheelhouse.  Well, the thing is,  he's not just one of those guys  that either wrote the movie  or was just the director.  Because a lot of the projects,  he was writing, directing, producing.  Like, he's all over the place.  Right.  But he named most of them.  One we didn't talk about  was Adventures in Babysitting,  which I know you mentioned earlier.  You got to.  In the ONA show,  but nobody responded to it  because I don't think  these children of the 80s  on our show  actually watched that movie. 
[03:12:00]  Right.  I mean, that was great.  That was his first movie, he said.  Yeah.  But for me, I mean,  the Home Alone movies.  That's where I first learned his name.  Right, exactly.  I remember the movie poster  when we went to go see  the original Home Alone,  which I think was 90, right?  Yep.  It said, you know,  a Chris Columbus film  in big letters with him.  That's when I started learning,  you know,  directors were really important.  Yeah.  Really important for these movies.  Yeah, he didn't write it, though.  I'm looking at his IMDb right now.  He didn't write it. 
[03:12:30]  He wrote, directed,  produced everything nine months.  That was that Hugh Grant movie.  But he didn't,  he just directed the Home Alone movies.  He did a hell of a job.  I mean,  figuring out all those  paint cans and booby traps  and although he had experience,  he wrote all the booby traps  for Data in Goonies  and then directed all the booby traps  for Kevin McAllister in Home Alone.  He loves booby traps.  That's what I said. 
[03:13:00]  Booby traps.  Breaking the penis off the statue.  It's my mom's favorite piece.  You know how long,  that's one of the,  you know how long it took me  to get that?  Like when I was a kid  watching Goonies for the first time.  Oh yeah,  I had no idea.  And it's like,  I think it's the statue is,  it's David, right?  Yeah.  Yeah,  and the penis breaks off  and mouth goes,  that's my mom's favorite piece  or whoever.  And forever,  like when I was a kid  watching that movie,  I'd just be like,  oh,  well,  I guess he broke  his mom's favorite piece off.  That sucks. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah,  it didn't dawn on you  until you were earlier  and then you're like,  wow,  that is really funny.  Yeah,  it's weird that his mom  has a favorite piece  of that statue.  Most people just like the statue.  By the way,  I'm getting a text in.  Anthony Cumia has a request.  Tell that fat fuck  I loved Adventures in Babysitting.  Loved.  Loved Adventures in Babysitting,  he says.  That was one of those movies,  that was like Clue.  Like Clue,  I watched it over and over again  when I was a kid.  And then I get older  and I actually get the jokes. 
[03:14:00]  He's just like,  oh,  I love this movie  when you're a kid.  And then you watch it  when,  I don't know,  when you're a teenager  and when Mr. Green says,  I'm going to go home  and sleep with my wife.  You're like,  holy shit,  he said he was gay  a minute ago.  When you're a kid,  you're like,  yeah,  who else is he going  to sleep with?  Obviously.  Mom and dad sleep together.  201,  you're on After Opie  and Anthony Live.  Yo.  What's up?  Hey,  just wanted to say,  I'm a big fan  of the show  and Tom Papa. 
[03:14:30]  And I saw him  over the weekend  and just wanted to say,  I've seen,  you know,  Sam Kinnis  and everybody  and just wanted to  give a shout out  to Tom Papa.  What is it?  How does he compare?  I don't understand  why you brought up  seeing Sam Kinnis  in that sentence.  Well,  no,  because he's up there  as far as I'm concerned  with stand-up comedians.  It's a hell of a compliment  to pay Tom Papa.  Well,  no,  because he was all,  I mean,  the thing is,  well,  no one talks about  his stand-up,  you know,  and it's like,  and I just saw him  over the weekend  and he was awesome.  Where'd you see him? 
[03:15:00]  He was awesome.  You know,  he really,  he was awesome.  I just wanted to give  a shout out to Tom Papa,  so.  All right,  cool,  man.  Thanks a lot.  All right,  brother.  All right.  I never see,  actually,  I did.  I saw Tom Papa  stand-up before I worked  here,  like when I was,  I think I was young,  not young,  young,  but I think,  I think he might have,  strangely enough,  played the prom show  that I went to  when I went to the prom.  I remember seeing him  somewhere.  He was hilarious.  On your prom,  you went to a comedy show?  Yeah,  I went to Dangerfields  for my prom,  after,  you know,  for the post-prom. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  We went to Dangerfields.  I did Caroline's.  You did?  Yeah.  Do you remember  who performed?  I don't remember  the headliner,  but.  Paul Mooney?  No,  but the first act up  was the guy  who used to be  the announcer  for the Jon Stewart show  on MTV.  Oh,  and so is that  exciting for you?  No,  because I saw him  a couple years ago  wearing a billboard,  a sandwich billboard  up on 58  selling jewelry.  Oh,  no,  that's not true,  is it?  No,  it's true.  That's horrible.  That's something 
[03:16:00]  I think his name was.  And he's got  the We Buy Gold  billboard on?  Oh,  God,  I'd rather him  wear the billboard  from Die Hard.  George in Ohio.  Yeah,  what's he talking about  reckless?  He's shitting on  his own movie.  That was great,  man.  You got to see  Daryl Hannah's tits  and jerk off to them  when you were  in high school.  How great is that?  Somebody should have  brought that up.  Like,  did you,  Chris,  before you start  shitting on this movie,  did you not realize  Daryl Hannah's tits  are in it?  Exactly. 
[03:16:30]  Come on.  I like that  Chris Columbus  would come in here  and shit on his own movies.  Although,  I have to tell you something.  I think,  I remember watching  I Love You,  Beth Cooper  and not hating it.  All right,  I'll talk to you later,  George.  I remember not hating  that movie.  What else has he done?  Stepmom?  Stepmom was the go-to movie  that made girls cry forever.  You want to talk about it?  He said he loved  emotional directors.  God damn.  Was that a tearjerker?  Larry in South Carolina. 
[03:17:00]  Sam Roberts,  professional broadcaster.  That's exactly right.  Well,  I was just curious about this.  I didn't bring it up yesterday.  Once Eric got  Dennis Falcone  to do the best of  or the worst of  actually on Saturday,  then he never does it again.  Once he gets rid  of a responsibility,  it's never his again  and now it falls to you.  What's up with that?  That's an interesting thing.  Larry,  I'm glad you brought that up.  I guess we never  really brought it up.  Somehow,  here's what happened.  The worst of the week  countdown. 
[03:17:30]  Well,  here's the history  of the worst of the week  countdown to bring  everybody back.  You remember the history,  don't you, Eric?  Oh, yeah.  Probably would prefer  I didn't bring up  every aspect,  but I think we should.  It used to be  Sam and Iraq  host the worst  of the week countdown  and then management  started really getting  their hands on it  and saying,  well, no,  you need to front sell  and back sell  and tease this  and do that  and Eric,  believe it or not,  does not like  when management  stick their fingers  into what he's  working on. 
[03:18:00]  He's not like,  Eric's not like  a super creative,  like his brain  doesn't function  like a creative.  He's more of a  behind the scenes dude,  but when he's  working on something,  he doesn't like  other people  meddling with it.  Is that right,  Iraq?  Yeah,  that's fair.  Even if it takes him  longer than it should  and somebody's like,  no,  just do it this way.  You want to do it  your way,  correct?  I think I know  what sounds good.  Right,  okay,  and you're like,  I've been in this  business for enough  years,  I know the show  better than anybody, 
[03:18:30]  let me do it my way.  So management,  you know,  they started meddling  with the worst  of the week countdown  and they started,  you know.  Because it used to  just be worst  of the week.  Right,  and they,  yeah,  they made it a  countdown,  they started saying  where to front sell  and back sell  and basically made it  a show that would  be familiar to any  audience instead of  our specific audience,  right?  And that's fine.  Right.  But you didn't  like them meddling.  To be fair,  you did not like  them meddling.  Okay.  So,  eventually, 
[03:19:00]  E-Rock comes to me  and goes,  dude,  nobody actually  listens to the  countdown.  And I went,  really?  And so he said,  yeah,  I'm not even putting  our voice tracks in.  Well,  let's be fair.  I go,  really?  It would take a long  time on a Friday  to try to lock you down  just to get the voice  tracks in.  Yeah.  Because we need to do  this.  You go,  okay,  and then Sam's  walking around  for an hour  and I'm sitting  there waiting  to get Sam  into the studio.  Because what's  the beauty about me  is I know  that all I have  to do is get 
[03:19:30]  into the studio  with E-Rock  and then E-Rock's  got to do all  the behind-the-scenes  work on this.  Whereas once I get  in the studio  and finish talking,  I'm done with my part.  So I was in no rush  the way E-Rock was.  So we stopped  hosting the show.  That's the long  story short.  Management found out  eight months later.  The show existed.  Right.  The show existed  just without hosts.  And management  got very upset about it.  E-Rock and I  were scolded  and rightfully so.  It was a terrible  thing to do.  Terrible.  And E-Rock  was punished severely 
[03:20:00]  and he should have been  punished more severely  quite frankly  because for me  anyway,  you were a bad  influence on me.  Oh, that's bullshit.  You're somebody  that I look up to  as a mentor.  That's bullshit.  You're somebody  that I look up to  almost like  if I had  a big brother  who worked here,  it would be you.  You know what I mean?  No, because you're  so full of lies.  Oh, oh, okay.  Well, anyway,  so E-Rock's been  hosting the countdown  by himself  ever since then.  And I don't know why,  but when we started  the indie version  of the countdown, 
[03:20:30]  Rob Cross said,  Sam,  we need you  to start hosting  the countdown  on indie.  I was like,  okay,  because you know,  on the indie channel,  we do the countdown  on Sundays  from 11 a.m.  to 1 p.m.  We do a two-hour version.  And he said,  we need you to start  hosting the countdown  on Sundays.  I go,  yeah, fine,  whatever,  I don't care.  And he goes,  and you know what,  you might as well  do it for the  Opie and Anthony  channel, too.  I was like,  okay.  I was like,  are you going  to fire E-Rock?  And he goes,  yeah. 
[03:21:00]  I go,  okay.  I didn't know why,  but that's what I said  to Rob Cross.  It's not difficult  and you'll just go along  with whatever  they want to do.  I was like,  but I'm not doing  any of the sort  of building  and editing  and behind-the-scenes  stuff.  And he goes,  no.  I go,  I'm just hosting.  He goes,  yeah.  And I go,  and you're firing E-Rock?  And he goes,  yeah.  I'm like,  okay.  I don't know why.  I don't know.  Nobody can tell  the truth around here  because that's not  what was told to me.  You weren't fired.  I knew what it was.  I talked to you  and I knew exactly 
[03:21:30]  what it was.  It wasn't a matter  of they wanted  to fire you.  The answer I got  was it doesn't make sense  to have two different hosts  for both countdowns.  And I said,  they're on two different channels.  It doesn't matter.  I knew what it was.  They just would not admit it.  But so why not have you  host the indie countdown?  They want you to do it.  You're just not,  your voice.  They like to have you  on the air  and not pay you for it.  Maybe because I won't  complain as much.  Your voice just isn't  friendly to the indie audience.  Is that what they're thinking?  E-Rock has a voice  that really sounds  very dependent.  I was aggravated 
[03:22:00]  doing it.  I mean,  it was all right.  I didn't mind doing it  at some point.  But yeah,  then I would get to the point  where my intros  were not very...  Is it because you do your thing  where you always do  whatever the bosses  tell you to do,  but you'll always have  to huff and puff about it?  You'll always do  whatever they tell you,  but you're always difficult  and huffy-puffy about it.  At times.  You've got to pick and choose  when you do that.  And you do it very often.  And I feel like  I either say,  no,  I don't think I'm going to do that, 
[03:22:30]  or yes,  and then it's just quick.  Like they're like,  well,  you know,  you're going to host it.  And I go,  yeah,  I'll host it.  I'm not editing anything.  Okay.  We're finished.  You know?  Yeah.  But there's been times  where I said,  no,  I'm not doing that.  And they'll say,  oh,  yes,  you are.  And I go,  no,  I'm not.  And then you've heard  arguments in the back there.  And then it turns out  you are doing it,  but with a lot of  huffing and puffing.  Or to some degree  of what they wanted.  So did they fire you  from the countdown  because you're difficult?  I'm guessing that's  what it is. 
[03:23:00]  God damn you,  Eric.  You don't care though.  They never gave me  an official answer.  So I was just like,  well,  I don't care.  Yeah,  I've noticed there hasn't  been a lot of tension  between us since I got  this big gig.  Are you okay with it?  Yeah,  I'm totally fine.  You're not bothered.  You know,  you can take me out  to lunch with that  big advance you got.  Yeah,  exactly.  I hope you don't mind  paying for yourself.  Snowy in Michigan.  Sam,  how are you doing,  sir?  I got the same,  but to be fair,  I got the same bump  you got when you started  taking over the interns. 
[03:23:30]  So we're both sitting pretty.  Nice.  What's up,  Snowy?  Not much,  Sam.  I got to call you out  a little bit there,  sir.  Okay.  You're telling the TV guys  how much of a dummy  they were.  Right.  And I remember  your interview with,  was it John Walsh?  Was it Adam Walsh?  Look,  look,  I had a slip of the tongue  and John Walsh  walked in here  and I accidentally  called him Adam Walsh  because that's what  we were just saying  a minute ago.  But I don't have  a teleprompter.  I don't have,  I don't talk in 
[03:24:00]  tiny little increments,  okay?  I understand,  Sam.  I know it's been  mentioned lots of times  in the past.  Yeah,  it has been brought up  a couple times  and I don't really need  you bringing it up again.  Have a good one,  Sam.  I was having a good one  until you called in  Snowy.  He doesn't win the Sudoku.  No,  he doesn't win the Sudoku.  I have an Opie  signed Sudoku  to give away  and Snowy,  you don't get it  for being a  Erock Weisenheimer.  This is what you do  to management.  You call him up  and you remind him  and you remind him  of things that  bother them. 
[03:24:30]  I should.  You call him at home  and you go,  hey Rob,  remember when  Obi was making fun  of you today  and Rob's like,  god damn it,  Erock.  I'm with my child.  What's up,  Chuck?  Chuck Rose.  What's up,  John in North Dakota?  You're from North Dakota?  Sound like fucking  Wendell the Pig  from Geico.  You think,  who does,  me?  Yes,  exactly,  man.  You sound just like  Wendell the Pig  from Geico.  Can I have a little,  yeah.  I thought you was  the voice of the  Geico Wendell the Pig. 
[03:25:00]  Okay,  somebody come in here  and pull up  Wendell the Pig.  I gotta hear  what this pig  sounds like.  John,  you live in  North Dakota?  Yeah,  man,  it fucking sucks  out here.  Did you,  did you,  do you get  the NBC channel  that the guy,  did you hear  the clip  that we played  earlier today  of the,  of the reporter  saying fucking  shit on the air?  No,  I did not hear  that yet.  Oh man,  alright,  I'm gonna play  this again  in case you missed it.  Listen to this clip  because I don't know,  this is in North Dakota  and they tried out  this anchor.  He got his first  shot at doing  the news  and he got it  done on the weekend. 
[03:25:30]  It's the NBC  affiliate out there,  wherever it is.  And he got his  first shot  as a weekend anchor  and this was  his first  appearance on television.  You're watching  the evening Sunday  on NBC North Dakota  News,  your news leader  in high definition.  Gay  fucking shit.  Good evening,  I'm here too.  Did you get to  see that?  It sounded like  he was gonna  come or something.  He just said  fucking shit.  That's how he  started the news  hour.  You didn't see it?  Do you watch 
[03:26:00]  the NBC affiliate  out there?  He's gone.  He's fucking  from North Dakota.  Well, it's up on  our Facebook  if you want to  check it out.  The video clip is?  Yeah.  Okay,  definitely check it out.  One thing I  thought he said  but you guys  didn't pick up on it  was when he was  trying to say  West Virginia.  It sounded like  he said  West Vigine.  West Vigine?  That's not even  close.  Yeah.  Because he was  just slurring  through the words  so fast.  I think he said  West Vigine.  I mean,  that guy was  a fucking idiot.  If I had a script  in front,  first of all,  I've never gone  on the news 
[03:26:30]  and said  fucking shit.  I'm sure  that I'd be  a better newscaster  than that guy.  You think he was  a jock?  Oh, yeah,  for sure.  He went to  television production  class and then  try to make  this a career.  He went to school.  He injured his knee  and went to school  to be a sports reporter.  And he was like,  oh, I'll be on the news.  Sure.  He can't read.  That's why he's lost  in front of a teleprompter.  All right.  You got one of those pigs?  I want to see  if I sound like  Wendell the pig.  No, that's Maxwell  the pig.  Totally different, dude.  One of our interns  is in here 
[03:27:00]  looking up Wendell the pig.  Some guy.  Yeah, this must be Wendell.  Excuse me, sir.  I'm going to have to ask you  to power down  your little word game.  I think your friends  will understand.  Oh, no.  It's actually my Geico app.  See?  I just paid my bill.  What do you think, Eric?  Yeah, I can manage my policy,  get roadside assistance.  You know,  pretty much access  Geico 24-7.  Sounds a little too good  to be true, sir.  Pretty much access  Geico 24-7.  Can I do a good...  I can pretty much  access Geico 24-7. 
[03:27:30]  No.  It doesn't work, does it?  No.  No.  North Dakota,  you did it again.  Thank you very much, intern.  David is your name, correct?  I knew it.  David,  in the Netherlands.  That's a different David.  You're in the Netherlands?  Yep, I am.  Holy Toledo.  What's up, buddy?  Well, no,  not in Toledo,  but yeah.  Good one.  I'm doing fine.  Yeah,  I'm really tipping it up today.  I don't know  what you're talking about.  What do you got for the show?  Yeah,  you made me pretty nervous.  I was waiting for 
[03:28:00]  like half an hour,  something on hold.  Oh, it's worth it.  Um, I,  sorry?  I hope it's worth it.  Uh,  no, it isn't,  but, um,  I, uh,  was thinking that, uh,  Kenny  just hates everybody  who doesn't agree  with cops  or what they're doing.  I'm gonna hang up.  I get what he's saying,  but I can't put him  through the  long-distance hours  of that call.  Why would you call  from the Netherlands  and talk so slowly?  Yikes.  Maybe he's a fan  of that news anchor. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah,  he's just a  fucking shit.  Uh,  Don,  on Long Island.  What's up, Don?  Hey,  Ken,  how you doing?  Good.  I was, uh,  I was listening to you  to the worst of the  Opie and Anthony countdowns.  Yeah.  And I listened to  that Friday show again.  Yeah.  That guy,  Mike,  that called,  said something strange,  and I'm,  and I,  I'm not a conspiracy  or anything like that,  but he said that  Was he the guy,  he's the guy  who called in 
[03:29:00]  and saw the shootout  live in Boston  as it happened?  Like,  you remember,  you heard about it,  the,  the shootout  that happened  right after  the brothers got caught  in Boston  with cops,  the one where  the older brother  ended up dying.  We had a caller  call in  and,  and he was there.  Like,  he had seen it  out his window  or whatever.  Yeah.  Right.  That's the guy,  Mike.  And he said  that a black SUV  came speeding around  at 80 miles an hour 
[03:29:30]  and ran right over  the,  that they were saying  was his brother.  But the SUV  that he got,  that he was,  they were in that night  was a white SUV  and all the brother did  was back over him  because they didn't know  whether he did it  on purpose or that.  So if a black SUV  came screeching around  at 80 miles an hour  and running up,  isn't there chances  on that that might be  that one of the cops  that went down  and actually ran him over?  I might guess,  but if they're going  to take the younger kid  alive,  why would they run  over the other dude? 
[03:30:00]  No,  I'm not saying  he did it on purpose.  I'm just saying  that if a black SUV  ran him over,  it wasn't,  I know,  I was just,  I was just tossing,  you know,  I'm bored on weeks.  All right,  I'll talk to you later,  Don.  Matt in Maine.  Hey, Sam,  how's it going?  Good.  What's going on?  Well,  I'm doing a show.  What do you think's going on?  Oh,  I don't know.  I just called  because I want  Opie's Sudoku puzzle.  All right,  if it means I don't  have to talk to you anymore,  I'll give you Opie's Sudoku.  For real?  Yeah.  That's a deal. 
[03:30:30]  All right,  goodbye.  I put him on hold.  Somebody get his information  so I don't have to  talk to him anymore.  Brad in Mississippi.  Good morning,  Sammy.  Good morning.  I was going to tell you  that when you are  imitating the Geico pig,  you sound a lot like Bobo.  Well,  okay,  I won't do that again then.  I don't mean to put you  through that.  Well,  no,  that's cool  because I've got to go  take a shit,  so I'll talk to you later.  Okay,  bye,  Brad.  Hope it all comes out smooth.

Steven Singer  is going to make  your Mother's Day shopping  so easy.  Mike in the Bronx.  What's up, Mike?  What's going on, Sammy?  How are you doing?  This newscaster  this morning  sounded like  Fandango  trying to pronounce his name  with a gay  fucking shit.  I don't know about that.  Fandango can throw together 
[03:33:00]  a sentence.  I would love, though,  if Fandango blew  his entire push  that he has right now.  He's finally, like,  not only is he big  in wrestling,  but, like, obviously  mainstream people  are talking about him.  For God's sakes,  we're talking about him.  If he just showed up  on Raw  and accidentally was like,  fucking gay shit.  Oh, God damn it!  I'm on the air?  Fandango.  Fan gay shit.  Fandango.  Oh, no.  I've blown it.  I've blown it again. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, it was a fun show today.  That news...  I was laughing...  I was cackling to myself  at, like, 5.15 in the morning.  I don't know if anybody else  was in this office  at that time yet.  I don't know if anybody else  was on this floor.  But, God damn,  is that funny.  And you had to know  that as soon  as that newscaster  said fucking shit,  everybody in that room  knew that was it.  I mean, it's going...  It's going to go online.  This kid is going to be  way more famous 
[03:34:00]  than you ever counted on  at this level.  What was it that you said  this was going to be as big?  Oh, Boom Goes the Dynamite, right?  Because that...  I mean,  the kid would have eventually  become an internet celebrity  because he's so bad  at newscasting.  And like E-Rock said,  the sex man,  you can get the news clip  at our Facebook page,  Facebook.com  slash Opie and Anthony.  But it was so bad  that it would have eventually...  He was the Boom Goes the Dynamite  kid of news.  And I guess it's North Dakota, 
[03:34:30]  so standards might be  a little lower.  But I don't know who put him  on the air to start with.  Eventually,  he would have ended up online  just because he's  a terrible newscaster.  So he ends up  rushing things along.  And his Twitter...  I mean,  why...  If that happened to me...  And it did happen to me, okay?  The Adam Walsh incident...  I wasn't sitting there tweeting  like,  oh, that was terrible  what just happened.  I said,  I want to become invisible  for a while.  I want to not hear about it.  I don't want to talk about it. 
[03:35:00]  I didn't have that option  because almost immediately  Ron and Fez started  playing the clip  to their heart's content.  But when something  that embarrassing happens,  all you want to do  is become totally invisible.  Right?  You don't want anybody  to know you're alive.  You certainly  don't want to draw  anybody's attention  back to that.  If anything,  you want to figure out  whatever you had working on  before this happened  and get people  to start looking at that again.  But no.  That's how you know  this guy's a  Chris Humphries-level 
[03:35:30]  retardo.  He tweets out,  well, that couldn't  have gone any worse.  Come on.  Why would you point that out?  Now anybody,  any of your friends  who didn't get a chance  to watch the news broadcast  are going to be sitting there.  If my friend  tweeted out  that I knew  said,  I'm getting a shot  to be a news anchor,  I'd be like,  oh, that's great.  Oh, I'm not home.  I didn't get to see him.  It's a Sunday night.  I wasn't in front of my TV.  If he tweets out  that couldn't have gone worse,  I'm going to do 
[03:36:00]  whatever I have to do  to make sure  I see that clip.  It couldn't be more stupid.  It couldn't be more stupid.  You know,  it's not stupid.

[03:37:30]  Did you learn anything  on today's show, E-Rock?  I feel like today  I learned several things.  I think there's a lot of  takeaways from today's show.  What to you  was the biggest  takeaway of today's show?  Well, the Neil Diamond thing.  You liked that the best.  It was funny  when I kept seeing it  on the news  but as we were listening  to it I realized  more and more  he was definitely  hearing it on time  on field level  but they piped  the audio in  over the broadcast 
[03:38:00]  and that's what  fucked everything up.  If they just did  the live mic  from the field  and just heard the music  echoing from the stadium  it would have been fine.  I would love  to hear the flip out  that Neil Diamond  must have had  after that.  Like, can you imagine  getting...  I'm Neil fucking Diamond.  I'm coming to America.  How about my boots  about to come  in your fucking ass?  I'm Neil Diamond.  You can't give me  an earpiece?  You made me look  like an asshole  out there.  An asshole.  He's throwing shit  against the lockers  in the locker room.  Yeah.  The players are like,  what the fuck? 
[03:38:30]  David Ortiz is just hiding  because there's  baseball bats swinging.  What the hell?  I'm Neil Diamond.  I'm a legend.  You ever see  Saving Silverman?  Yeah.  I love Saving Silverman.  It's a great movie.  They're all...  It's a...  Not if Neil Diamond  has anything to do with it.  Yeah, it was...  What's his name from...  Jason Biggs  from American Pie,  Steve Zahn,  and Jack Black, right?  Yeah.  And Steve Zahn  is always hilarious.  I don't care who you are.  And Amanda Peet. 
[03:39:00]  And Amanda Peet.  But they play...  I guess it was Jason Biggs  follow-up after American Pie.  So it obviously wasn't  fated to be a giant hit.  You can't really come back  from American Pie.  But to me,  that movie is hilarious.  The three of them  are in a Neil Diamond  cover band.  But they perform  like at carnivals  and on boardwalks.  Right, right.  They're like the Virgil  of Neil Diamond cover bands.  They're just in subway stations  and whatnot  trying to convince people  to pay him $20  to take a photo.  Wearing different jumpsuits 
[03:39:30]  from different  performance eras  of Neil Diamond.  I love shit like that  when people...  Because that's like  creative.  Like some writer  was just like  it'd be funny  if they were in a  Neil Diamond tribute band  and then they just do it.  You know?  They don't...  They're not testing shit out.  They just do it.  Because why would you think that?  Why would anybody do that?  Did intern Dave in there?  Did he have a  takeaway from today's show?  Did he have a takeaway  from today's show?  What'd you learn?  Being a news anchor  in North Dakota  is pretty fucking easy.  It's pretty fucking easy.  They will give that job 
[03:40:00]  to anybody.  I swear to God.  Listening to that guy  fall apart on the news  made me think  why wouldn't I have  gotten into that business?  I would love to see  what his demo tape was.  I don't even think  he could have had one.  I mean, I think  that he just...  He hung around the station  for long enough  and was just pestering  people for long enough  and they go,  okay, we'll put you  on the air.  We'll give you a try out.  Do you think the guy  that gave him the okay  is in trouble now too?  Of course.  The news director  because why would you put  somebody... 
[03:40:30]  Why would you put  a retarded person  on the air  to anchor the news?  Like, I understand  a special interest piece  but you cannot put  a special needs kid  and have him  anchor the news.  You get fired  for stuff like that.  But all I could think...  I mean,  you all know  of my troubles  in this business  of broadcasting.  Radio is dead.  You know what's not dead?  News.  Every city's got  a little local news show. 
[03:41:00]  I'm sure  I could have been  a news anchor.  If that guy  can get to anchor level...  And he's a young guy.  He was in his 20s,  I'm sure.  There has to be a...  I bet now,  without the training,  I could find a station  that would put me on  as a news anchor.  I could pull it off  better than that,  I'm sure.  What about Scorch?  What do you mean,  what about Scorch?  Doing sports or news  in a local station.  All right.  I feel like Scorch  could probably pull it off  better than that guy. 
[03:41:30]  He could do it  without cursing.  He could stay clean.  That guy's got to work blue.  Wouldn't Scorch  be a great sportscaster?  Yeah, he'd be  a great sportscaster,  but all he'd want to do  is bring it back  to himself.  He'd be like,  hey, Red Sox  are doing well,  but let me tell you  about Scorch.  Scorch is doing  pretty fucking great.  I mean,  Bob,  BFG,  oh shit.  He drops the F-bomb  for his broadcast.  I'll tell you  what my takeaway was.  This was all  leading someplace,  and I'm surprised  you guys didn't mention it,  and it was just  kind of in passing,  and it was right 
[03:42:00]  before Chris Columbus  came in,  so I feel like  people forgot about it,  but Ant hasn't had  a drink in 11 days.  Right.  He hasn't had  a drop of alcohol  in 11 days,  and for those  that are new  to the show,  let me tell you,  Uncle Anthony  likes to have  a drink or two.  He likes to imbibe,  as they say.  He likes to have  an adult beverage.  Nothing wrong with that,  but I was very surprised  that he hasn't had  a drink in 11 days,  and it sounds like,  you know,  it's one day at a time,  but he's like  enjoying himself. 
[03:42:30]  He's like,  okay,  I'm trying this sober thing.  Do you think that,  E-Rock,  do you think a sober Anthony  would invite you over  to his house more,  because I know  you've had issues  with not being invited  to his house?  I don't know.  Do you think it was  because you're not  one of the heavy drinkers,  so maybe,  like for me,  I always get the open invite,  but never the specific invite.  And I don't know  if sober Anthony  will be more likely  to say,  hey Sam,  why don't you come over  on Saturday?  Yeah,  I don't think I've gotten  the specific invite.  Ever. 
[03:43:00]  Has he ever been like,  E-Rock,  I'm throwing a party,  I want you to be there.  Well,  he said it to all of us.  But has he ever said it  to you specifically?  Specifically.  I don't believe so.  Ouch.  But we've been to  one or two of his parties.  Is that why you got  intoxicated and told him  that you knew  he didn't like you?  No.  Why when you were  intoxicated did you  say he didn't like you?  Because I just didn't  think he liked me.  Do you still think that?  I don't know.  I bet if we got you  liquored up,  it'd be a pretty concrete yes. 
[03:43:30]  Do you think he saw you all?  I think he's fine with me.  Do you think he saw you  all liquored up and said,  I can't be like that?  Do you think you were  the motivation?  After all those years,  one show I do it  and that's the problem.  You get all drunk on tequila  and Ant starts going,  is this what I'm like?  I don't want to be this.  I think he'd get mad  for you comparing  me like that.  I'm just saying,  maybe at some point  he had to come to a realization,  unless it really is just  he wants to lose  a couple pounds.  I don't know,  good for him. 
[03:44:00]  You know,  sometimes shit just happens  and you go,  you know what,  I'm going to try not doing this.  Have you ever tried  to lay off anything?  I'm going to guess no.  Yeah,  I have.  You've stopped doing  something that you've enjoyed.  Well,  it usually involves eating.  Yeah,  that's what I mean.  Yeah,  I've cut things out.  Really?  Yeah.  Like what?  Well,  some of the stuff  has been cured  from this show,  so like cinnamon  and mayonnaise.  Yeah,  but that's not you saying  I need to cut this out 
[03:44:30]  of my diet  for health reasons.  That's you saying  these two food products,  these two condiments  almost killed me.  I was almost dead,  first because of cinnamon  and then because of mayonnaise.  So yeah,  I think I'm going to cut them out.  No,  I have tried soda.  I really have.  It's tough.  Several times  and it's really hard,  especially like last summer  I tried to do it  and you know,  we had a bunch of  different little parties  at my place.  Yeah.  And there'd be stuff left over.  So there'd be,  you know, 
[03:45:00]  coolers of beer  and whatever  and then coolers of soda  and then I was just like,  I can't just let this go to waste  and I'd wind up drinking it.  And it's the worst thing for you.  I know.  But you can't,  I've been reading up so much  on aspartame,  if that's how you pronounce it.  What is it?  Oh,  because that's the stuff  that's in diet soda?  Yeah.  Stuff that's in diet soda.  So you're like,  well,  you thought you're drinking  the diet soda  because it's better  than the regular soda,  but if you drink  the regular soda,  the sugar can increase diabetes.  Right.  The diet soda,  it's that embalming fluid potential,  whatever the similarity is, 
[03:45:30]  and also rots out your joints.  Is that what it does?  Yeah.  It removes a lot of the...  So it gives you arthritis.  Worse,  like to the point where  you can get poisoning from it  where your joints  are not repairable.  Well,  I've been drinking a lot  of Diet Coke,  doctor.  Yep,  that's it.  Oh,  man.  Wow.  Yeah,  because like I don't drink,  I don't smoke weed.  Yeah.  My only vice is just  I'm terrible with junk food  and especially soda.  And it was the... 
[03:46:00]  I...  And that's where you and I  are a little different  because I'm not the big junk food.  I'm a big food guy.  Right.  Yeah.  But I'll drink,  like when I say junk food too,  I mean like fried food always,  you know,  like it's just,  it's all bad for me.  Yeah.  But soda is the worst thing  in the world to try to...  I know.  I mean,  I'm not going to say  it's the worst thing in the world  because it's not worse  than trying to fiend off heroin,  but soda is very difficult  to cut out of your life.  I started 2013 going,  yeah, 
[03:46:30]  I'm not going to drink soda anymore  because when you're young,  you could drink and eat  whatever you want.  When you get older,  you start realizing  everything starts catching up with you  and I'm 29 now.  And when I was probably like 27, 28  is when the little pouches  of skinny fat  would start to show up on me.  And I would notice right away,  like,  oh,  a little titty meat  that didn't used to be there  is there now.  Oh,  what's this?  Oh,  what's this little,  my sides of my stomach  are getting a little wider  than they used to be.  So it's like,  okay,  I'm going to stop drinking soda. 
[03:47:00]  You can't do it.  It's impossible.  I don't know what they put in this stuff  and I know  that it's a sickness  because it's not even  like a good soda.  Do you know  what made me give up  my I'm not drinking soda thing?  No.  I gave it up.  I think I did like  two and a half weeks maybe.  And I saw a soda  that made me say,  it's okay,  I can indulge  every now and then.  Like,  I tricked myself  into the whole thinking of,  well,  you can't just cut it out  because if you just cut it out, 
[03:47:30]  then,  you know,  you'll never be able  to stick to it.  So I just have it  every once in a while  and then once in a while  goes from once a week  to just on the weekends  to every now and then  during the week  to every day again.  You know what soda it was?  That you thought  was healthy enough  for you to cheat on?  No,  it wasn't healthy enough.  It was just like,  this is worth it.  I need to have that right now.  Oh.  Take a guess.  Mr. Pibb.  It wasn't Mr. Pibb.  Oh,  because that's the one  you always get.  I love Mr. Pibb. 
[03:48:00]  I love Vernors.  I love Dr. Pepper.  What's Vernors?  Vernors is like,  they have it in the middle  of the country.  It's like a really strong ginger ale.  It's huge in Michigan.  They don't have it here.  But I wish they did.  I'd be drinking it all the time.  But,  it was  special  limited edition  Pepsi Clear.  X Factor  Oh no.  Dragon Fruit Pepsi.  Ew.  I had to have,  I'm like,  look,  I gotta taste this  Dragon Fruit Pepsi. 
[03:48:30]  I've never even heard of that.  Why would you?  Why would anybody  drink Dragon Fruit Pepsi?  But I sat there going,  I gotta have it.  And I drank it.  And it was fine.  It tasted like Pepsi  with a little,  I guess,  is Dragon Fruit  really a thing?  Yeah,  they put it in a lot  of the vitamin water stuff too.  So it's really,  there is a fruit  called Dragon Fruit?  I believe so,  yeah.  Because I've seen it  on a few other products.  It's like a little  Asian gay guy.  They call him Dragon Fruit.  I'm only kidding.  Ha ha ha.  Gay fucking shit.  What's your,  what's your soda?  Mine,  growing up was just 
[03:49:00]  Cherry Coke.  You love Cherry Coke.  But,  you know,  in the last,  I guess since it came out,  it was Cherry Coke Zero.  I can't even really drink  regular Cherry Coke anymore  because it's too sweet.  So instead,  you just rot your joints away.  Cherry Coke Zero.  It's been terrible  for your teeth  and your joints.  Yep.  But you can't stop,  can you?  Uh,  it's difficult  because it's that,  it's Diet Dr. Pepper.  Mm-hmm.  Even Diet Cherry 7-Up  is pretty good too.  It's pretty good.  But yeah,  I can't,  it must be 
[03:49:30]  difficult.  I don't know  if it is difficult.  I mean,  Ant's gone 11 days  without drinking,  he said.  Mm-hmm.  He's gone on stretches  before though  and he was also sick  for the first half.  So it's probably easier  when he was sick.  Yeah,  when you're really sick,  you just don't want to  eat or drink anything.  Right.  And so,  and so,  it's a good place to start.  Yeah,  I mean,  it is,  it's a good catalyst.  I just wonder,  uh,  if he's serious.  I could have sworn,  I swore  that he had to be intoxicated 
[03:50:00]  on Friday  when he started posting pictures  of what he got  for his backyard.  If you go to,  uh,  I love that.  Go to Anthony Cumia  on Twitter.  And yeah,  this has to be  your dream come true,  Iraq.  Because he had  a full-size  fiberglass  velociraptor  positioned  strictly  in his backyard.  He should have,  he's got a huge,  um,  hedge or whatever it is  right behind his pool.  Yeah.  He should put it in the head  so just the arms  and the head  are sticking out 
[03:50:30]  like it's jumping out at you.  All I was thinking  was how,  because I was sworn  that he was intoxicated  for buying it  and for posting pictures of it.  How long  until Ant gets drunk  and starts firing off rounds  at the velociraptor?  Get down!  There's a raptor!  Pfft!  Pfft!  The neighbors are calling  and the cops show up.  Ant,  you shooting your dinosaur again?  Can't be doing that shit, Ant.  All right, officer.  I'm sorry.  Terry in Tennessee.  Hello?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I'd like to talk about 
[03:51:00]  the awareness.  You would?  Yes.  I love that shit.  Yeah, uh,  Slavo!  That's it?  You know,  I told you,  just tell the call screener  you want to say Slavo.  There's no reason  to create a cover story.  Well, I mean,  I want the people  to be free  to say what they want to say.  That thing is chasing you around,  huh?  That Slavo name.  You showed up on my show  on Sunday,  yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  And immediately,  as soon as you sat down,  somebody called up  and yelled out, 
[03:51:30]  Slavo in the house.  Yeah, it's one person  who doesn't turn this channel off.  It's that guy?  It's that guy  that just called in,  you think?  No, it's, well,  Guy, Lady Trucker, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  He calls to every program.  She's got a lot of driving to do.  Am I the only one left  that will pick up her phone calls?  I think so.  It's got to be rough for her.  I think Dr. Steve  hangs up on her at this point.  Really?  Yeah.  Dr. Steve doesn't hang up  on anybody.  I know.  He works in a cancer ward.  He just wants to help people.  Apparently not.  He's had enough.  My God. 
[03:52:00]  My God.  Does Vernors make anything else  besides ginger ale?  Diet Vernors.  They make Vernors?  Oh, they don't have  a product line?  Just the...  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  They make...  Vernors is just...  It's what the sodas...  It's like Pepsi.  You get a Pepsi,  you get a Vernors.  I love old-fashioned sodas.  What do you mean?  Like, some of those places  in the Midwest or down South,  they have old-fashioned sodas  like Birch Beer and...  You know what's big now?  Orange Cream,  things like that.  Maybe it's just because  in Westchester,  there's a lot of Mexicans,  but what's really big 
[03:52:30]  in my area, at least,  is importing soda  from Mexico.  Like, they're all in bottles,  and it's Coke and Pepsi  or whatever.  Fanta.  But they're in these  little bottles,  and it says,  ECHO E MEXICO.  I don't know why  if that's different.  Is soda different in Mexico?  So, soda's different everywhere.  I don't know if I'd drink it  from Mexico  if they give you water warnings.  That's what I was gonna say!  You'd think that the water  that they use to make the soda  is just as bad as the shit  that comes out of their faucets. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, I wouldn't try that.  No.  Kyle in North Carolina.  Sam, what's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Good, buddy.  Hey, do you guys prefer  drinking your soda  from a bottle  or from a can?  I just enjoyed  a nice Coke  zero cherry  from a can.  It was awesome.  Yeah?  Yeah, the can's the best.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess I never thought...  Well, it depends.  The can's good for that,  but to drink a Coke  out of a bottle  is really good.  I don't really care.  I just drink it, I guess.  I don't know if it matters.  I mean, I know you like to add 
[03:53:30]  a little ice cream  to your Coca-Cola.  No, I've never done that.  I don't think that's true.  There's this whole song about it.  Travis in Kentucky.  What's going on, boss?  Hey, 7-Up  distributes  Verners.  I used to actually be  the 7-Up guy.  I used to put that shit  up on the shelf.  I can bring you some  if you want.  I drive a truck, man.  Yeah, bro.  Next time you're in New York,  bring a lot of fucking Verners.  Well, how the hell  am I going to meet you?  I got a 75-foot-long truck.  I don't know.  Tweet me.  I'll find you.  I don't know.  I'm on Twitter.  I'm a goddamn  old-school truck driver.  That's why I call your ass.  Well, get it. 
[03:54:00]  All right.  Well, next time you're in New York,  call the show.  All right.  And then you're good.  I'll find you.  By the way,  Verners and vanilla ice cream  are also a good time.  Really?  Well, get me some Verners  and I'll try it.  Mike in Florida.  Yeah.  The pop that they get  out of, what do you call it?  Mexico.  Right.  The reason they import it  is it has real cane sugar in it.  It's not that high fructose  corn syrup shit.  Oh, that's better for you,  I guess.  I don't know.  It's a still pop, right?  Yeah, I guess so.  Well, Pepsi released  something recently. 
[03:54:30]  Their version of Pepsi  with the real cane sugar.  Isn't that crazy?  Like, we're now at a point,  like, forever.  The whole idea was  products,  they wanted to get them  away from sugar.  So they would call it  anything but sugar.  And now the big ad  is like, hey,  it has real 100% sugar in this.  Well, it was because  it was cheaper to use  the corn syrup and everything.  But now so many people  are getting, you know,  fat and diabetic  and whatever  from the corn syrup.  Now they're saying,  look, it's made with Splenda  or we're going back to sugar. 
[03:55:00]  Tom in Long Island  actually has a point  that he wants to make  to E-Rock.  That's not a valid point.  What's up, Tom?  Rock ball!  Okay.  I'm assuming a lot  of these calls.  The phones are going nuts now.  289.  Yo, Sam.  Yeah, did you want to?  No?  Okay.  386.  You're on the air.  Yeah, hey,  tell Sam the difference  in the Mexican sodas  is keen sugar.  Whatever.  I thought everybody  wanted to yell Slavo.  Is that why you're in here,  Troy?  I don't want to talk sodas.  No, I just need to grab you.  You what?  I just need to grab you 
[03:55:30]  to listen to something  as soon as we're done.  Oh, okay.  What is it?  Production piece.  Oh.  You want to write  the Uncle Paul thing today?  Whatever you want to do.  All right, let's do it today.  That way we have a little  something to mention  in the meeting.  Everybody thinks  we're very impressive.  We've got a couple things  to work on, though.  Nice.  You want to write  the Uncle Paul thing today, Sal?  Yeah, sure.  Is there something  you wanted to yell?  Well, I just,  I don't know what happens  every time I call in.  I set off this chain reaction.  You called in?  Yeah.  Why don't,  when you call,  you call from the office?  Yeah, I just call  from my cell phone, yeah.  And wait,  and just to say like, 
[03:56:00]  oh, I want to talk about.  I don't know if he called Terry,  I think it was today,  it was Terry in Kentucky  or something like that.  Right, and then.  I don't mean to set off  this chain reaction every time.  Oh, God.  8-6-3.  Did you want to say something?  8-6-3, yes.  Well, you said it.  8-5-0.  I don't trust any of these people.  They don't know  how to work a fucking phone.  E-Rock,  Sal is calling from the office  to yell Slabo on the show.  Oh, he knows I do it.  Yeah, what do you think?  I didn't know  that was him this time. 
[03:56:30]  Troy, how would you react  if you found out  Sal was going out of his way  to from the office  call up and be like,  fuck Troy  and hang up?  I mean, I guess  at this point  he's used to it, right?  You think E-Rock's  just used to it?  Well, it's just kind of like,  what's he going to do?  Because you would be pissed.  I'd be pissed.  You would say something.  I'd probably sort of  seek some sort of revenge.  Right.  You think E-Rock will?  No.  Not this time, huh?  He'll buy Sal lunch.  Sal, you're pretty confident  that you'll get out of this  scot-free?  Free lunch today, bro.  Yeah, because that's what happens.  So disrespectful, Eric.  So disrespectful. 
[03:57:00]  We had the whole show  of nice conversations  between me and you  and Sal has to come in here  and just rub your face  in your dog shit again.  He needs attention.  Well, you know.  He gets it.  You let him get away  with murder.  Whatever.  You got to go.  Time's up.  You were right, Troy.  You were right.  All right.  I'll go listen to this thing.  You stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next  and we'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye. </pre>
