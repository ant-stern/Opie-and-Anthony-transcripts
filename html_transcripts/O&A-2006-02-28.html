<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of radio station promotional gimmicks like "two-for Tuesdays," "block parties," and "four-play weekends," expressing their disdain for these formats and the overplaying of certain classic rock artists (The Doors, Bruce Springsteen, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zeppelin, Peter Frampton). They also lamented David Lee Roth's disastrous radio career, comparing the listener drop-off to a building fire.  This segued into an in-studio interview with actress Mila Jovovich.  Initially awkward, the conversation eventually covered her roles in *The Fifth Element* and *Resident Evil*, her Russian upbringing, emigration to the US, and working in the Soviet Union.  Callers chimed in on both the radio promotions and David Lee Roth's failure.  Opie and Anthony reflected on their past guest interactions, contrasting their previous harshness with their gentler approach towards Jovovich.

The show continued with a discussion of their exclusion from *Talkers Magazine*'s Top 100 Talk Show list. They expressed frustration,  analyzed potential reasons (criticism of their attacks on commercial radio), and then proceeded to irreverently review the list itself,  frequently mentioning *Sex and the City* and focusing their ire on Rusty Humphreys, playing one of his parody songs.  Kevin Smith's positive comments were highlighted, contrasting with negative feedback from some Howard Stern fans.  Listener calls and Tim, their intern (who called in to discuss reduced hours due to family obligations), contributed to the conversation.  Their upcoming Hard Rock Cafe St. Patrick's Day broadcast and an egg-eating contest were also mentioned.

A significant portion involved a test run for the St. Patrick's Day egg-eating contest.  Tim, a former seafood manager from Big White Foods, brought in 60 green-dyed eggs which turned out to be soft-boiled, resulting in a messy and chaotic attempt at eating them by Opie, Anthony, Laszlo, and another intern, Bill.  This was followed by further discussion of the *Talkers* list, expressing disbelief and frustration with Michael Harrison, the compiler,  and vows to contact him. Listener calls, including one from Greaseman (who also didn't make the list), added to the discussion.  The segment then featured a comedic Greaseman coin exchange machine advertisement followed by repeated, mocking airings of a bizarre commercial for a weight-loss product called "AIDS" (pronounced A-Y-D-S).

The show then tackled news stories about transgender individuals.  The first involved a 71-year-old transgender woman, Lily Macbeth (formerly William Macbeth), resuming substitute teaching, prompting discussion and transphobic comments from the hosts, fueled by listener anecdotes.  A second story involved a transgender woman harassed by police. This led to further discussion and listener calls.

The final segment began with a caller's childhood story, frequently interrupted with profanity by the hosts.  Laszlo was present in studio.  The discussion shifted to MP3 watermarking technology and the illegal sharing of downloaded music (using Jim Norton as an example).  A combative exchange with a caller, "Rob," criticizing Opie's comedy ensued.  A caller recounted witnessing a car accident, followed by another criticizing Jimmy's behavior.  The hosts discussed HBO's DVR restrictions, advertising techniques during the Olympics, government software ("Advise") used for detecting potential terrorists, and privacy concerns.  A caller, "Mark," discussed XM radio availability in Iraq.  The show concluded with discussions about the end of Black History Month, wireless helmet cameras, pornography consumption on mobile phones, parental monitoring software, child GPS trackers, and the future implications of such technology,  with a final plug for Laszlo's website.  Mila Jovovich's earlier appearance was mentioned again.

[00:05:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bad chips for everybody.  On this fine two-for Tuesday.  Huh?  What?  Two-for?  Ugh.  That annoys the piss out of me. 
[00:05:30]  Why?  The two-for concept.  Because the only room in my house I don't have XM in is the bathroom.  And when I go into the shower, I have to put on regular radio.  A lot of times I listen to the news, but very occasionally, some rarely, sometimes I want to hear some music.  Do you shower in the nude?  Uh, Opie, I am completely nude.  My body glistening with water and soap.  Stop drooling, Jimmy.  Do you have a nice shower gel to lather up? 
[00:06:00]  I had to quit you.  All lathered up.  You got something to scrub the skin?  Ow.  A body scrubber?  A standard-issued washcloth.  With exfoliation, perhaps?  No, I like, um, I like a washcloth and caress soap.  I use caress, and I caress myself with it.  Ugh.  What do you use?  Lush.  You're still doing the lush?  You're still using your lush, fanatic, obsessive creep. 
[00:06:30]  No, it's good for me.  That lush soap that I bought lasted, like, two showers, which goes my body.  It fell apart.  It was awful.  Yeah.  I hated lush.  You gotta buy the soap that, uh, they got it down.  They figured out how to make fucking soap.  So anyway, you're in the shower.  Yeah.  And I'm, uh, listening to, I guess, what the hell was on, uh, uh, classic rock.  Q104 does the two-fers, right?  In New York City, yes.  Yeah.  And I didn't realize it was Tuesday or that it was even the Q when they do the two-fer. 
[00:07:00]  And, uh, you get in there, and if you hear two or three songs, uh, in a row, it's a miracle.  So I hear one song, and I think it was Bruce or some fucking Doors song I heard a thousand times.  Was it Bruce Juice?  Bruce Juice.  Some Bruce Juice to start your morning off.  It was either Bruce or, like, The Doors, which, you know, very rarely will I listen to The Doors anymore. 
[00:07:30]  I've heard it enough.  Thank you.  Well, you've heard the cuts they play on the radio enough.  Yeah.  It's fine.  Go to Deep Tracks.  You'll hear some Doors songs you've never heard before.  Doors songs that you've never heard.  The drug-induced fucking drivel.  Jim Morrison does the hokey-pokey spoken word.  Lovely.  Do the hokey-pokey.  Then you turn yourself around.  Shut up.  Self-important douche.  He really was a high boob.  We get it.  We know.  Yes, you're a genius. 
[00:08:00]  You're an American poet.  Shut up.  No one understood you.  Leave Jim Morrison alone.  So confused.  Oh, Jim, we hardly knew ye.  Leave him alone.  Just fall asleep with your limp dick, stupid.  Drunk.  I really like Jim Morrison.  Leave him alone.  Some Doors song will come on, and you're like, all right, it's ending.  Cool.  Maybe another cool song will come on now.  Maybe a good song will come on.  Then you realize it's two for Tuesday, and you've got to sit through another fucking 15-minute Doors song. 
[00:08:30]  This is the end.  This is the end.  My only friend.  The end.  This song doesn't end.  This song won't end.  Starring Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise.  The end.  Oh, very nice.  I liked that movie growing up.  It's just the only good thing about that song reminds me of Apocalypse, which is kind of cool. 
[00:09:00]  But, you know, for the most part, the two for is, I think two for is more detrimental than a plus.  Yeah.  Because you hear a song you hate, you might sit through it if you're halfway through it.  You know what I mean?  Waiting for something good.  Two for Tuesday, the next one comes on, you're out.  You're not going to sit through a whole other sucky song that you don't like.  It all depends on the band.  Is that it?  Yeah, because if it's something you like, then I guess you're going to hang out.  All of a sudden, it's like, Hold On Loosely starts up by 38 Special. 
[00:09:30]  You're like, oh, not only do I hate the band, hate this song, there's another one coming after this.  What would the other one be?  Ooh, funny.  Oh, wow, it's been too long.  Can they play a Rossington Collins and get away with it, Opie?  I don't know.  It's a mix-match twofer.  Mix-match twofer.  What?  I tried to fool you there.  Right.  I played a solo cut from one of the artists in a band.  They get all excited when they do a twofer like that.  Yeah, I love the jocks.  They get all excited about their cleverness. 
[00:10:00]  They sometimes take a phone call.  Hey, that wasn't a real twofer.  No, but it was.  It was.  Let me explain.  They played together in a band back in 1968.  Oh, fascinating.  I played Leonard Skinner and Rossington Collins and blah, blah.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah, all right.  Thank you.  Give me Freebird and go to the bathroom.  You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world.  That's what I do.  My radio still does that.  Speaking of 20 minutes or whatever, what's the slogan? 
[00:10:30]  We'll give you...  You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world.  You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world.  You know, my cab ride...  We'll give you that for a while.  My cab ride is no more than five minutes.  Probably four minutes.  Yeah.  And they're right.  Because every once in a while you get a cabbie and they got that 10-10 wins on.  You know what's going on in the entire country in four minutes.  That's all you need to know.  And the stupid news at night, a half hour, and you're still not informed.  That is all you need to know.  I could tell the second I get into the truck in the morning if it's a slow news day or something big's happening. 
[00:11:00]  If I'm hearing like a 15-minute cut of John Montone talking to a cab driver about something,  I know we're safe for the day.  No terrorism.  No troops have died.  It's like, we're speaking with the cabbie about the ice conditions on the highway.  Nothing happened today.  Nothing happened.  Thank you, John.  All right.  We're all alive and well.  Let's say hi to Shane in Florida.  Shane.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:11:30]  What's up, Shane?  Hey, listen.  You can't forget about the triple shot weekend.  Oh, wow.  That's not what it's called.  It's called a block party.  It's a block party.  It's not in Florida.  It's not.  They stink, then.  Yeah, they don't know what they're talking about.  Three...  Triple shot weekend.  No, it's a block.  Which I never understood, because shouldn't a block be maybe four?  Yeah.  But four is a four play.  Oh, that's a four play.  Didn't you invent something, Opie?  Aren't you an innovator in one of those categories?  I had my hand in the old four play weekend. 
[00:12:00]  Four play weekend.  Where the fourth cut is always live.  Where the fourth cut is always live.  Ooh.  Mixes it up a bit.  Shut up!  So you take the block party weekend, you add one.  Right.  And you're adding one more that's live.  Ah, you got a lot.  Throw it all together.  It's a four play weekend.  Come on.  Did you get a pat on the back from the PD?  No.  No.  Absolutely not.  I got nothing.  Didn't get a raise.  Nothing.  I was a part time douche in Rochester.  Later, Max.  Thanks for seeing the talent. 
[00:12:30]  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bless you.  Yeah.  What do you think of 15 play Friday?  You put like two CDs of the same band on a row and just come back.  And then leave.  Go home.  I would have an OCD weekend.  You just play the same song over and over again.  Just gets caught in a loop.  That's the jock committed suicide weekend.  How funny would that be?  Just one weekend.  Just do something so stupid.  An OCD weekend.  Just play the same song.  And play like Freebird over and over and over again. 
[00:13:00]  Don't they?  Apparently, I think that's what the classic rock stations do.  When I hear that.  Freebird start up.  I cannot get out of there quick enough.  Yeah.  I like Leonard Skinner, but I got to be out of there.  Rock radio did wreck some of the greatest songs of all time.  Yeah.  Because when Freebird came out, oh my God.  Who didn't listen to it every time you heard it?  Stop.  Even, you know, and a lot of people are going to laugh, but this will prove my point.  Stairway to Heaven from Zeppelin.  Yep.  Holy shit.  The first, you know, couple times you heard that song. 
[00:13:30]  Now you can't.  As soon as it comes on the radio, I can't turn it off quick enough.  Any Peter Frampton song.  Do you?  You?  You were in there.  That's what I'm doing.  You didn't like the talk box there, Jimmy?  How's that one go?  No.  No.  You invented a live album.  You got to give him credit.  What year was his big album? 
[00:14:00]  I know his big album was.  1830.  70s.  Early 70s.  1976.  That before Kiss Alive?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  Was that the Kiss Exploitation album that each one of them put out one with their face on  the fucking cover?  No, those were Kiss, the solo records.  Believe it or not, Aces was the best of all, which you wouldn't expect.  Was it, Jimmy?  Yes, it was.  I had all four of those.  Me too.  Of course you did.  And they all sucked.  Everyone.  Except for one Ace Frehley song.  The greed even back then.  The sheer greed, presumptuousness of that band back then to say, to get into a room and 
[00:14:30]  go, you know what we're going to do, guys?  Each one of us is going to put out an album because these fans will grub up any dime they  can and we will sell them four albums instead of one.  They were right.  Of course they were.  It's Gene Simmons, by the way.  Paul's was in bed.  Really?  Yeah, I think Gene Simmons was the worst.  Did it open up and have a picture of him with his big hairy chest?  Ooh, all of them did. 
[00:15:00]  Even Peter's had Paul's chest lift.  And well it should.  Of course.  Let's go to Frank in Michigan.  Frank.  Hey guys, there's a classic rock station in Detroit that's rewriting the book.  Yeah?  They're doing classic rock Z to A now instead of A to Z.  Z to A?  Z to A.  Wow.  They're insane.  Don't they have to skip some letters because there just isn't a band or something?  X.  Well, XTC they throw in there.  Oh, do they? 
[00:15:30]  Wow.  Joe in Baltimore, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Ballmore.  How you doing, man?  You got the Lacko twofer down here where they only play one song and if you call in you win  a prize.  Oh, yeah.  You got to pay attention to the point if they don't play a twofer.  That's your cue to call in and win a prize.  Yeah.  It's a Lacko twofer.  Wow.  It's called Lacko twofer.  Hey, we slipped up.  Oh, you got us.  Ha, ha, ha.  I love the stations that do the $25,000 guaranteed. 
[00:16:00]  You're guaranteed to get either so many songs in a row or so many minutes of music or no  repeats.  Well, the big one is like, you know, we play 10 in a row without commercials.  Yeah.  If you catch us playing nine, you know, you win $10,000.  Yeah.  That's always a huge fall or spring book promotion.  Big promotion.  Some station in your area will be doing it.  And these dopes will listen around the clock waiting for the jock to fuck up knowing, well,  they didn't know this at the time, that it was predetermined and it was always when there 
[00:16:30]  was the most people listening.  Of course.  Usually like 740 in the morning or 520 in the afternoon.  I remember BAB did that once out on Long Island.  But these dopes are like one in the morning.  No, we got to listen to BAB.  You know, if they don't play 10 in a row, I can win $10,000.  $10,000.  It's all for me.  They did that promotion once and I didn't know anything about radio and it was during  afternoon drive.  Right.  Where they were giving it away and the jock was saying, I don't know, I think something 
[00:17:00]  might happen here where we might have a problem playing all the songs.  Why would he say that?  Now they're like promoting the fact that here it comes.  Yeah, they're now promoting it.  Thank you.  It wasn't like an accident.  Hey, I thought it was supposed to be an accident.  Oh man, I don't miss that shit whatsoever.  Here it comes.  And then they'd fool some people by playing like a Zeppelin song where one goes right into  the other, but it's so familiar that way that everyone thinks of it as one song and people 
[00:17:30]  would call up, hey, you only played nine.  No, no, no.  Let me explain to you.  Let me explain.  Oh, those two songs.  It's actually two songs by Zeppelin.  They're still doing shit like that.  You know, my one experience with calling into commercial radio, and I'll always hate them  for this, was in like, I lived in North Brunswick.  It was a little local light FM station.  And I called in and requested Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Yes, Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  And I thought I'd be slick.  I'm like, yeah, it's my girlfriend and my anniversary, and that's like the song we like 
[00:18:00]  to listen to.  That's a wonderful song.  It's an anniversary song.  Yeah, they didn't play it.  Let's go to Michigan.  I hate them.  Of course.  Herb?  What's up, boys?  Hey, Herb.  What's up, Herb?  Hey, Pumpkin.  I just wanted to call and tell you guys about that.  How Anthony said the OCD day?  Yeah.  There was a radio station that was, I don't know, they were changing formats, and they  played Garth Brooks, Friends in Low Places for 24 hours straight.  That's stunting that they do when they change formats. 
[00:18:30]  Sometimes they'll do that.  What was the reason for that?  I don't know.  Just to make us listen to shit-ass music?  Oh, all right.  Sometimes they do it to purge the audience.  It's either they play a song over and over again, or put, like, David Lee Roth in.  Whichever.  Both seems to work very well.  I don't know if the rest of the country's going to care, but David Lee Roth took over  for Howard Stern here in New York.  Bozy, bozy, bop.  And maybe in your city as well.  Well, the ratings came out, and it is the, what do you even call it? 
[00:19:00]  You can't even call it a train wreck.  An abomination?  Like, Anthony wrote in an email to me yesterday, people leave a burning building.  No.  Yeah.  People left the station.  People left Billy Roth faster than.  Faster than they leave a burning building.  There you go.  There you go.  They just, they were fleeing like they were in some type of mortal danger from the station.  They lost something like 75% of their audience. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  In one month.  Yeah, in a month.  In one month.  Bozy, bozy, bop.  Bozy, bozy, bop.  City, bop.  I ain't got nobody listening to the show.  Isn't that true?  And I'm sure Howard's going to be taking credit for that today, but I guess he should in a  way.  But it also means that the person they threw in there is just horrific.  Yeah.  Horrific to lose 75% in one month.  To not be able to hold on to anybody, really, because those numbers really, statistically, 
[00:20:00]  it's nobody listening.  Dude, you know, if you lose 75% of the audience, eventually the advertising is going to suffer.  I think some more things can suffer other than just advertising, Jim.  I don't mean to be too inside with the folks out there and throw around the deep stuff.  You know, John Minnelli called me about David Lee Roth when he first started, like he was  on a week, and he asked my opinion on it.  And I killed the dude, right?  I'm like, it's fun to listen to because it's a train wreck. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  It's not going to be fun to listen to after another week or two.  Right.  And he actually wrote me back and said that my comments were too harsh for the newspaper.  Too harsh?  Yeah.  For the newspaper?  For the newspaper.  You're talking about David Lee Roth doing radio, and you were being honest and accurate.  Yeah, because the article in general was very harsh, as well it should be, because the guy  had no business doing a radio show.  Yeah.  Another, you know, another like celebrity that thinks he could do radio.  It just, you can't do radio if you're a celebrity from some other walk of life. 
[00:21:00]  You have to work too hard, and these guys aren't used to working too hard.  So the whole article when it came out was brutal, and my comments were just right on,  and he didn't want to use them because it was too harsh.  There was too much harshness in the article.  It needed a little balance.  Yeah.  I'm like, well, you ain't getting me to say anything positive about that train wreck.  No.  And you look silly.  There are people like Dee Snider, who got into radio, you know, at whatever level, but 
[00:21:30]  he didn't start replacing, like, one of the number one jocks in the country, ratings-wise,  in the number one market in the country.  You know, if David Lee Roth wanted to kick off his radio career, perhaps he should have  started in Phoenix or something, you know?  Perhaps out there in Montana there's a station.  They're saying that Roth, in these latest ratings that just came out, they're estimating  that 63,000 listeners, he had 63,000 listeners in January. 
[00:22:00]  What were they thinking?  In January.  Even 63,000 people.  Just to give you an idea, when Howard was over there, he was doing 277,000.  Yeah.  So that's how many people said goodbye, goodbye, and weren't listening to David Lee Roth here  in New York.  Ben just raised a good point.  Um, he bent circles and then handed it to me.  This is, the people that say, oh, comments were too harsh.  Here's a line from the, uh, what's this, the post?  It's about the kid hearing his dad kill his mom himself.  Oh, right, yeah.  The panicked child then locked himself in the bathroom and heard another gunshot from his 
[00:22:30]  suicidal dad blowing his brains out before cops rescued him.  They printed blowing his brains out.  That's not too rough.  But him trashing David Lee Roth a little over the line.  Is there a little more clinical way to say shooting yourself in the head is then blowing  your brains out?  Yeah, of course.  But yeah, Opie's comment was a little too harsh for David Lee Roth.  And there was some intelligence in what I was telling Manelia.  I said that, you know, I said that this radio thing is a tough life.  It's not easy.  Yeah.  And, uh, a lot of celebrities get into it and realize, wow, I have to have a work ethic? 
[00:23:00]  Fuck that.  Yeah, they think it's just, you know, you come in and goof around and stuff.  Right.  But there is a little bit of work you have to put into it.  I mean, the reality is we had a really good show yesterday.  No one gives a shit today.  No one cares today.  No one cares.  We have to come up with four new hours of stuff today.  Brand new goodness.  And, you know, if you're just going to wing it like David Lee Roth is trying to do over  there, of course you're not going to be successful.  Of course.  To get a stampede.  Could you imagine, how many people did Howard have? 
[00:23:30]  You said there.  Oh, 277,000.  So picture about 200,000.  That's in a quarter hour or so.  Yeah.  Picture about 200,000 people running, screaming from something.  What that would look like.  What that would look like.  That would be something that had never been seen on the face of the earth.  The whole tsunami walked away from him.  Unbelievable.  That's how many people left.  Just walked away.  He drove away as many people as the tsunami killed. 
[00:24:00]  Know what's even funnier?  Holy shit.  There's a morning show here in New York City.  They do a show which is half Spanish and half English.  Oh, Spanglish.  What do they call that?  The Spanglish?  Right.  Spanglish.  Ready for this?  Because you're trying to figure out where these people went.  Yeah, that's the thing now that all the people in radio are trying to do.  Unfortunately, I'm sure Howie's going to do his Howie math today and say they all went to satellite.  It's just not true whatsoever.  I'm sure he got a big chunk, a nice chunk, but not everyone said, fuck this, I'm going to satellite. 
[00:24:30]  But they went other places.  Went somewhere.  And there's this Spanish language show, they went up 50%.  Wow.  50%.  So, obviously, a lot of these listeners from the old K-Rock days didn't want to hear David Lee Roth and would rather listen to a morning show that speaks half English and half Spanish.  I'm only understanding half the show, but it's better than any of David Lee Roth. 
[00:25:00]  Is that amazing?  They were the big winners, basically.  By the way, David Lee Roth is on vacation.  He's on vacation.  On vacation after six weeks of radio.  Six weeks.  In the shitter.  How do we get that contract?  On vacation.  Wow.  Unbelievable, right?  How long?  How long is this vacation?  I don't know.  I would say forever.  I'd like to go on vacation.  I would say that he's calling up Eddie Van Halen as we speak.  Do you think?  Oh, yeah.  Get the band back together.  Boozy, boozy. 
[00:25:30]  Eddie, you're not doing well and I'm not doing well.  Let's get back together.  Who cares?  We hate each other.  Pokey in New Hampshire.  What's up?  Hey, man.  The AM station up in Boston calls itself the 50,000 watt flamethrower of justice.  And then an FM station is now calling themselves a 50,000 watt flamethrower.  I don't get it.  Who's the 50,000 watt flamethrower then?  The FM station is WHEB up in Portsmouth.  They should literally have a guy with a flamethrower go in there and kill everybody that came up with that idea. 
[00:26:00]  Flamethrower.  They stole it from an AM station.  They stole it from RKO.  See, you know, I need to be a program director.  I would call our station the 50,000 watt flamethrower and then I'd have a guy in the van just driving around flaming everybody.  Flamethrower, lighting people on fire on the street.  We're the 50,000 watt flamethrower.  You never know where the flamethrower van will show up next. 
[00:26:30]  Waiting for concert tickets.  Some guy just opens fire and kills eight people and drives off half a line.  We are flamethrowing our listeners.  That's right.  The best is when they have a crazy slogan at a radio station.  They're like, we're the 50,000 watt flamethrower.  Here's Helen Reddy.  I am woman.  Hear me roar.  Or the only station that really rocks. 
[00:27:00]  Really rocks.  And then they play Lights by Journey.  Are you rocking?  Are you?  Do you think you're rocking?  Do you think there ain't any other station out there maybe rocking a little more than you right about now?  Oh, right.  We're your home of rock and roll.  Yeah?  Rock and roll lives there, huh?  Yeah, whatever.  Joe in New York, what's up?  Hey, good morning, fellas.  With regard to the Minnelli article, man.  The truth is often harsh.  And Opie, I've got to give you credit on this one.  You nailed it in early January. 
[00:27:30]  Nailed it.  What did I say in early January?  I'm trying to remember.  David Lee Roth, man.  A couple weeks, it would be fun to listen to, train wreck.  And then it would be over.  And it's basically over.  You'd be getting a phone call if you didn't get it already, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, we're...  Well, wait.  We're waiting for our phone to ring, Anthony.  Yes?  Now that David Lee Roth is a disaster, we're waiting for it to ring.  Oh, oh.  But we're here, guys.  We're here for you. 
[00:28:00]  We know David Lee Roth is a disaster.  We're here for you.  Hands go up.  But we do radio, too.  Right.  We're sorry for what we did with the Sex for Sam thing.  We're ready, guys.  We're ready.  Put us in, coach.  Put us in, coach.  Let's say hi to Mark at Jersey.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey to you, Max.  We've been on 94.1, which is the Philadelphia Station. 
[00:28:30]  David Lee Roth, they're not even playing him at this point.  So I don't know if he's on vacation or...  He's on vacation.  No, no.  This is great.  And I hope we're not boring the rest of America, because this is a big radio story.  David Lee Roth took over for Howie, right?  And after six, seven weeks, he's on vacation.  Usually when you go on vacation, you play best of, of your show.  Yeah.  Uh, they have basically said, uh, he doesn't have enough material for a best of show.  No.  So they can't even gather, what, if he's off a week, that'd be 20 hours, let's say. 
[00:29:00]  20 hours.  They can't find 20 good hours of his, uh, show that he's done.  That they could rerun.  So they're like, fuck that, and they actually moved other people into his, uh, into his spot.  Yeah, they jockeyed around their jocks.  That is a bad sign.  And it doesn't sound good when you say, he's on vacation, we're in most mediocre.  There's no good clips to play.  Guys, uh, best of those five minutes.  They didn't even announce he was on vacation either.  They're just running the show like he doesn't exist.  It's pretty funny.  Call me, uh, Kreskin, but I, I think there's something going on over there. 
[00:29:30]  You think?  Yeah, I think so.  Thanks, Mark.  All right.  All right.  We gotta say hi to Mia.  Mila.  Mila.  Mila.  Sorry, Mila.  It's early.  Mila Jovovich.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  She's adorable.  Oh, this is always fun when all the publicists have to come into the studio.  Oh, listen, you guys.  Just to make sure nothing crazy happens, right?  Listen.  Let me tell you how awful we are.  Whenever, uh, pretty girls come in here, we clam up. 
[00:30:00]  We are incapable of speaking to, like, pretty girls that are guests on the show.  Well, that'd be fun.  We could be getting silenced for a couple of years.  We're terrible.  That'd be great.  Yeah, we'll, we'll.  Those are some pretty hot pictures.  Oh, my God.  We should have covered those up.  Yeah, but where did you get those?  We didn't realize a lady was coming in today.  We should have covered up our wall.  You know, it's somebody that.  I thought she was a good girl now.  Uh, well, that's when she was a bad girl.  Oh, right, right, right.  That's, uh, Christina Aguilera being a bad girl.  Where, what, what pictures were those?  Uh.  German magazine, probably. 
[00:30:30]  That's a really good question.  Where did we get those pictures?  Uh, some pervert on the staff, uh, printed a mouse.  Oh, he's had her face on someone else's body writer.  That must be it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's gotta be it.  No.  He's like, no!  Is that what we did?  No.  No.  Every time I look at the Christina Aguilera pictures, I thought that, uh, they were real.  No, they are real.  They are real.  All right, so.  Steve would know.  Who put those pictures up there?  Oh, I don't know.  It's from Maxim Magazine?  It's from Maxim Magazine, so.  It's probably like Paris Hilton's body. 
[00:31:00]  Right?  Well, Paris is up over there, I think, underneath the American mess sign.  Something.  Why don't we have, why don't we have pictures from the Fifth Element?  That's what we should have.  I'm kind of glad that I don't have anything from the Fifth Element that can go on this  wall, actually.  You do.  When you're, when you're in the little, when you're in that little thing just made up of  some, like, gauze it looked like, kind of wrapped around you.  Well, I guess if that turns you on, gauze, man.  That hospital thing is real sexy. 
[00:31:30]  Do you think, in the Fifth Element, when you came out and you were in just that thing  that was kind of strips all around you, that that wasn't really hot, that guys weren't  watching going, oh, because, let me be the first to inform you, a few years later, it  was very hot.  A few years later.  It was a very nice costume.  And then you're flying around all over the place, jumping out windows on top of flying  taxi cabs, and nothing came out.  Like, that looked like an unsecured little outfit you were wearing.  Were you glued in there? 
[00:32:00]  Well, you know, she's a super being, so, you know, it all keeps together.  Was it duct taped and stuff?  Well, no, the whole thing was sort of one piece, so it was kind of like a bathing suit.  Oh, we were-  Kind of like a wet bathing suit.  Yeah.  It certainly was.  That's like one of the most memorable parts of that movie, though, is you wearing that  get-up.  I know, that was a crazy character.  That was fun.  Yeah.  Jumping off the building.  And then, of course, the Evil Dead. 
[00:32:30]  Evil Dead.  Resident Evil.  Resident Evil.  Evil Dead sucks, man.  It's Resident Evil.  Oh, my God.  Evil Dead's kind of cool, too.  Gotta give it that, but-  There's a lot of Evil Dead fans out there.  Resident Evil.  Resident Evil.  Resident Evil.  I saw you naked.  Wait, she was naked in that?  I saw you naked.  Okay, for a second, you see boobs for a second.  It was for a second.  Boobs for a second.  Wow.  And then I saw it on, I guess, regular TV, and I'm waiting for that part to come, and 
[00:33:00]  they cut it out.  Damn it.  It's like seeing the TV version of Scarface.  Yeah.  He's like, this city's a chicken.  Just waiting to be plucked.  We did a whole thing on our show about that.  It's so wonderful.  I can watch the TV edit over and over.  Oh, you like that?  I love it.  Are you kidding?  It's so wonderful.  They put in scenes that were deleted because they're so violent.  They'll put in scenes that never made the real movie. 
[00:33:30]  Like, the scenes that are now on the DVD, these awful scenes that meant nothing.  Yeah, the cutting room floor scene.  Yeah, flying to him driving and looking for an address.  Right.  Well, I've never heard, you know, beep that, you know, replaced with, not that.  Yeah.  I was like, wow, that was kind of real, too.  Some of them, they really reached.  Some not a Scarface thing.  You know, it's very kind of sophisticated, not that.  I guess, I guess these days they do two versions sometimes and have the actor actually doing 
[00:34:00]  a screen version.  Listen, that was so genius.  The things they pulled out the box for that, like, no one does today.  Yeah.  I mean, a chicken waiting to be plucked, that's genius.  Someone got paid to think of that and come up with it.  The things of that stuff.  And they were in a room going, oh, good one, good one.  I didn't think we were going to get one for that.  That's kind of like a cool hobby to, like, find, like, all the TV versions, like, the  funniest TV versions of, like, the most violent movies because I think those are kind of amazing.  Like, you have these limits and you've got to do your best with them, you know? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  So you're like a chicken waiting to be plucked.  Wonderful.  I got it.  You ever see your own dialogue replaced on TV or something and kind of laugh?  Like, that doesn't even sound like me.  Well, those things are really funny.  I mean, every time I have to do a TV version, you know, we're always kind of, like, trying  to think of, like, what can you possibly say?  You know, of course, I hadn't seen Scarface, the TV version at that point.  So, you know, we were just doing, like, flickity flock and, like, you know, just, you know, 
[00:35:00]  oh, dit, or something, you know?  And they're like, no, that sounds too much like...  It sounds too much like the bad word.  Hey, I got it.  The T word.  Yeah.  I don't even know if you can say that on the radio.  Tit?  Uh, tit.  Let me fill you in on something, Mila.  You're in the world of satellite.  Let me fill you in on a little something, Mila.  You're in the world of satellite radio.  Are we actually on the air right now?  Yes.  Completely on the air.  You know what's funny about that?  So many guests will ask that exact question.  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
[00:35:30]  We will have 10, 15 minute conversations and people will go, so when are we going to go  on the air?  Thank God my mom's not watching.  She's like, you're on the radio and all you can think to say is a chicken waiting to be  blacked up.  I hate to tell you, it doesn't get much better than that.  So enjoy your time.  And if your mom's watching the radio, you might want to have a little talk to her.  That's true.  It's kind of early.  I still haven't gotten through my coffee yet.  Are you generally maybe a potty mouth in regular life or do you?  Well, look, you know, as I fiddle with the pen. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, you might not want to touch any of those pens.  Yeah, we don't know.  People chew on them.  Pluck that, man.  Oh, she told you.  I want her to curse.  Give us a curse.  Give us a curse.  No, no, no.  I can't.  You do it in movies.  Listen, I might do it just by accident anyway, so I just try and control it.  Is that what happens though when you're out and about, you kind of just throw up, pepper  it in?  Pluck this, pluck that, pluck you, pluck everything.  I don't think. 
[00:36:30]  She's having a good time.  She's got some very lucrative deals she doesn't want to screw up is what she's talking about.  She shouldn't be on this show.  I see.  What makeup spots are you on?  L'Oreal.  Yeah, L'Oreal.  Yes.  And she comes out with her big eyes, big blue eyes.  Pluck that.  L'Oreal.  You started out as a model?  I started, well, my mom was an actress in Russia when I was growing up back in the 70s.  And so I started acting.  So on TV?  I was like nine.  Back then?  Actually, not on TV because, you know, in the 70s, TVs were a little harder to come 
[00:37:00]  by.  But on the big screen, yeah, I would go to my mom and see her like doing ADR for movies  and stuff.  So kind of followed in her footsteps.  So I started when I was nine acting and then fell into modeling when I was 11.  You know what?  The weirdest part of that whole answer was that TVs were hard to come by.  We just can't.  Well, it was the Russia.  No, I know.  As an American, you just can't understand that you would actually grow up without a TV.  Well, I mean, yeah, I guess by the 70s, everyone had TVs in America. 
[00:37:30]  Not that way in the motherland.  So how would you watch TV?  But how would you watch TV?  Just one family member somewhere would have it?  Well, no, we had a TV.  Right.  But if your mom's doing movies, that's like, yeah, so everyone came over to your house  to watch the TV.  Yeah, kind of thing.  Was there American TV back then?  Like any shows making?  No, you're joking.  There was hardly Americans in Russia.  They didn't like anything back then.  No, but I understand.  We go over to Mila's house.  They have toilet paper and blue jeans. 
[00:38:00]  I'm talking on the black market.  Maybe you get a VHS of Dallas or something shipped over.  I don't know.  Jesus.  Back then, they didn't want any Western stuff being beamed in.  But it was still being.  It was all just like, everything wonderful here today.  Sky is blue.  Government loves you.  That was pretty much all they wanted the people knowing back then.  This is like the most awful thing is that it's so true. 
[00:38:30]  It's so not funny.  And then, like, Western information stuff started encroaching on.  And everybody said, I'm leaving.  I could drive a cab and make some money.  Plug this chicken.  So when did you make your way here?  Yeah.  When did you escape?  Well, we did, actually.  We came over and never went back. 
[00:39:00]  Did you, you left when it was still communist?  I'm still here.  There's somebody still at the house, like, some KGB agent waiting.  Where is Mila?  She said she was going out to get me blue jeans.  What did she find out?  What the hell is in her Starbucks, man?  Oh, my God.  You guys have been waiting 20 years.  No, but listen.  The craziest thing is, is that you're not too far from the truth.  What did you have to do? 
[00:39:30]  You actually, like, fled?  Are you one of those people that had to go into a wall?  My mom had to meet with KGB members.  Really?  Literally, like, three times before she married my dad.  And she had to get interviewed, like, so why are you marrying a foreigner?  Wow.  And foreigner, he's Yugoslavian.  Like, Americans don't even think of that as a different nationality.  Do you know what I mean?  But in Russia, she had to get interviewed.  But the person was really cool because he had a daughter my mom's age. 
[00:40:00]  And he would have wanted her to do the same thing kind of thing.  So he was sort of, you know, just going by the page.  But he let her go.  Yeah.  Never heard of those.  Wow.  I know, right?  That's like a movie right there.  Never saw that in the movie.  The cool KGB agent.  Ah, you can go.  I don't know.  I saw you swallow some microfilm, but pluck that chicken.  You'll go.  You're losing her mind.  I love that.  She's all right, man. 
[00:40:30]  She's all right.  She's just looking at her.  Check her coffee.  I'm telling you, something's in that coffee.  I can't take it.  All this racist humor is so much.  Oh, racist humor.  Hey, where's Danny?  Danny's totally putting down my country.  We got a...  No.  It's so funny.  I can't...  No.  One of our guys...  It's true, though.  It's so awful.  One of our guys is a huge fan of yours.  One.  What is that noise?  Silence.  Where is he?  You hear that noise?  What the hell is that?  Well, he's coming in to ask you a question, but...  Yeah, he's going to be all nervous and everything.  Probably all sweaty, ew. 
[00:41:00]  I can't wait to meet him.  Hi, Danny.  Sounds great.  This is Danny.  There you go, Danny.  Hi, Danny.  Hello.  I heard Nathaniel sold me down the river.  Nathaniel sold me out today?  Why don't you tell her about you and your mom?  No.  Oh, I don't think we're going to do that.  No.  Danny likes to drink with his mom and then, I don't know, then say stuff maybe he shouldn't  be seeing.  Inappropriate stuff on camera.  It was really...  Yeah.  So you're a big fan?  I am a huge fan.  Absolutely.  Favorite movie? 
[00:41:30]  Gotta be Fifth Element.  Yeah.  Gotta be Fifth Element.  That one is really good.  Thank you.  And you have a question?  I do?  Do you?  Go ahead.  I don't know.  Do I?  What's your interview?  Something about the fake language?  Well, I heard that in the Fifth Element, that fake language got so intense that you could  actually hold a conversation with the director.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, the director and I, would it be able to write back and forth?  I'd be able to ask him questions in the language, and if I was missing a word, I'd just give 
[00:42:00]  him a list of vocabulary that I needed for my next letter, and he would sort of give  it back to me.  And I would incorporate it, sort of try to incorporate it into my everyday life.  That's almost as geeky as people speak in Klingon.  Listen, no, it's true.  It's true.  I get pretty geeky when it comes to research and getting prepared for things.  I love it.  I love reading and being on the computer.  My really amazing night for me is putting music on the computer for hours. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, is that what you do?  Yeah.  Have fun.  Like, I had such a great time last night, like, all this jams on my computer.  That's a pretty tough thing to do with your computer.  No, no, no.  With GarageBand, it's awesome.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, you got the Mac?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, definitely.  And I have Logic.  All the artistic people have Macs.  What?  Do you have an IBM?  I have both.  Oh, that's cool.  I'm divided.  Well, I got to play games. 
[00:43:00]  You know?  I got to play my games.  So, you need a Windows computer to play the games and stuff.  Yeah, I heard that.  You ever play some of the video games?  You like that?  Well, you know, I'm not-  Play yourself in one of them?  No, not yet.  Not yet.  They still have to come out with the Alice video game.  But, you know, my brother really loves, like, all the violent video games.  I'm more of a strategic-  Who doesn't?  Yeah.  Oh, you like the strategy game?  Yeah.  I like the strategy.  So, I would, like, build up the towns and the reserves, and then he would go out and conquer.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  So, I'd just be, like, the administrative part, and he would be, like, get the glory.  Right, right.  He spends all the hours building up the army.  At those games where you got to build up a civilization.  Yeah, I love that.  And some people are good at building the civilization and keeping the economy going and keeping the  trains running on time.  Well, SimCity, man.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, I've got it under control.  My budget is great.  Do you hate the fires, though, in that?  Like, every two seconds, something's catching on fire.  Well, you've got to create water towers, dude.  Is that what it is?  Well, they don't have water, man.  See, I'm terrible. 
[00:44:00]  No schools for me.  No anything.  I rule with an iron fist.  Everyone gets all pissed.  Unlike the old Soviet Union, pretty much, is the way I run things.  And people do the same thing.  They leave.  I've got a barren wasteland, and everybody's going to greener pastures on some other person's  game.  They're on Mila's.  They're going, no, it's great.  She's a huge movie star.  She's excited when her budget's okay in the video game.  Look, I've got a surplus.  It's like all these scripts are piling up.  Screw that.  Oh, God.  Don't even say it.  It's so true.  I've got to feed them.  Don't even.  Oh, really? 
[00:44:30]  You're shirking your responsibilities?  Well, a bit.  It's been kind of crazy busy and stuff, so sometimes, you know, I'll just go into sim world.  Ah, ah, ah.  Let's say hi to Lisa Montreal.  It's a perfect world.  Lisa, what's up?  Hi.  Good morning, my friend.  Oh, my God.  Hi, Lisa.  I'm so sorry for making a fool of myself.  Judy.  Hi, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm like, Judy.  I'm like, Judy.  I'm like, Judy.  It's Mila.  Listen, I wanted to say, Mila, I love you so much in The Fifth Element.  Thank you.  I'm so obsessed with the movie.  I even have the tattoo. 
[00:45:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, I love it.  It's beautiful.  It looks really good, actually.  Thank you.  Um, that's what I'm saying.  Oh, security.  Oh, awesome.  Can you send a picture of yourself to my website, MilaJay.com?  Yes, I can.  Actually, I have my website, so I'll send you my MySpace.  Yeah, let's go to the website.  Oh, on MySpace?  Yeah.  Cool.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  You got a MySpace?  Bye.  Yeah.  You do?  Well, you know, just started out, and I have a clothing line with my really close friend, Carmen Hawk.  It's got that Fifth Element outfit on your clothing line?  No. 
[00:45:30]  It's called Yovavich Hawk.  Oh, well, I've got it underneath my sweater.  Uh-oh.  She's taking a close spot.  What the hell's going on here?  Nice.  Hey, look at that.  Very nice.  Yes.  And things like that.  Look at you branching out.  There you go.  Diversifying.  Yeah, so, so, uh, so, yeah, we've been doing a little bit more conservative than Leeloo,  but, you know, just as cool.  Let's say hi to Brian in Nevada.  Brian, what's up? 
[00:46:00]  Hey, Hope.  Hi, Brian.  Leela, I love your movies.  Thank you.  I particularly loved you in, uh, The Messenger.  Thank you.  I thought you just were extremely good at that.  Is there going to be any more resident movies coming out?  Well, we start filming, uh, number three in May, so.  Oh, I think that you're just, you're just, you're just awesome, and you managed to pull  off every single character you portray.  Oh, thank you so much, Brian.  Thank you.  Okay, and Ant, please unban Tugboat Bri. 
[00:46:30]  He didn't mean to get you on your bad side.  All right, I'll unban him.  All right, we'll deal with that in a little while.  Jeez.  Fuzzy from Whackbag.  What's up, Fuzzy?  I ban people occasionally from certain sites.  I can't believe I got Leeloo Dallas and my two favorite boys.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, Leeloo's great, man.  And we're getting along, this is fun.  While getting along, she seems to be extremely happy to be there, which is...  It's cool, I'm having a great time.  I go right to sixth grade mentality when a pretty girl comes in. 
[00:47:00]  I sit there, and like, I keep my head down.  Yes, yeah, I get all that, but you're very, uh, fun.  You're sixth grade, too.  I know, it's like...  I'm like, what's up?  You're sixth grade, too.  Isn't it great to be immature?  We're doing great.  I'm ready to look at her and ask what kind of ice cream she likes.  We finally admitted it, too, because we had so many hot girls coming through here, and  we just, we just can't talk to the hot ones.  Really?  What do you guys do?  It's so awkward.  But as soon as we finally admitted it to all our listeners, it's gotten a lot easier. 
[00:47:30]  We have multiple pounding on you.  Oh, my, Christina.  What's your motivation?  Let's go to, uh...  All right, Fuzzy, you got a question?  Yeah, I just wanted to let her know that.  We only got a couple more minutes with her.  My wife and I absolutely adore her.  Oh, thank you.  Because she's just beautiful, elegant.  I'm all about you.  Just want to let you know.  We're going to name our first girl after you.  You're the best.  Wow.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Don't take this interview as an example of my normal sophistication levels. 
[00:48:00]  You're multifaceted.  Hey, uh, you got a question, though, Fuzzy, or no?  No, I'm all set.  I love you.  Oh, thank you, Fuzzy.  Thanks, guys.  I think we have time for one more call, and we got to let her go.  Kent, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Mila?  How's it going?  What's up, Kent?  How's it going?  Good.  Thank you.  Wow, that guy totally took my question about Resident Evil.  But I'm wondering, who's attached to direct?  Um, uh, this guy, um, named, uh, Peter Mahoney.  Okay, cool, cool. 
[00:48:30]  And he's, uh, he's really wonderful.  He's a British director, and, uh, he's, he's really great.  He's going to do a good job, and Paul Anderson's going to be producing it, too, and stuff.  Oh, it sounds great.  Those movies end really well for sequels, by the way.  When that first one ended, and you just come out in the street, and everything is just...  Well, it's cool, because, um...  Destroyed.  You know, the world in the video game doesn't really end.  It just keeps going.  So, it's like every movie gets harder and harder, like a video game.  You must have to work out a bit before those roles, because it seems like you really get 
[00:49:00]  your ass kicked.  Well, yeah, you know, I definitely train a lot for these kind of movies.  Sim training, or real training?  Well, unfortunately, it would not be great if, like, my sim could do it for me.  That would be so wonderful.  And get points, too.  Yeah.  Because, you know, my problem in sim world is that I just make them work so hard.  Because I'm the perfect...  I'm like, don't be perfect.  And they always have to be cancers, because that's, like, really middle of the road.  You know, they're just clean enough, just nice enough, just good enough personality.  Yeah.  And then they take over.  The middlemen take over. 
[00:49:30]  Gotta figure that out.  Well, no, because...  And then my game is always, like, ooh, no play makes, you know, Angie, like, a really  horrible girl.  Yeah, and then you gotta give them things to do.  She gets straight A's and stuff, but she doesn't play enough.  They're emotionally screwed up, but they're doing well and keeping the budget.  They are excelling, man.  You know?  We're getting the rough off.  I know.  You're on a whirlwind tour here, and you gotta go.  But thank you so much for coming in.  You were great.  Are we promoting anything today? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You guys, we almost maybe forgot.  Ultraviolet.  Ultraviolet.  It's a new movie.  It's awesome.  It's crazy.  It's just ill.  Craziest stunts ever that I've ever done.  And it comes out March 3rd.  March 3rd.  Yeah, please.  Ultraviolet.  Yeah.  Mila Jovovich.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you so much, man.  You're great.  Thanks, guys.  We had a lot of fun with you.  Thank you so much.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Get us out of here, Derek. 
[00:50:30]  I hate to admit it, but I think we're growing up a little bit.  Ew.  No, we're not.  We're growing up just a little bit.  See what happens when you're nice to guests?  You get bigger and better guests.  See, this is the pattern.  We should have learned this lesson years ago.  I know.  Here's the pattern I've been noticing.  We've had guests come in.  We're treating them nicely.  They are having a really good time, and we're having a really good time, and apparently the 
[00:51:00]  listeners are enjoying it.  Yeah, so we get good radio out of it, which is the most important thing.  So then after that, they bring another good guest.  Right.  And if the same thing happens, it happens again.  Why didn't we see this for 10 years, Alfie?  I don't know.  Why did we have a guest come in, berate them, treat them like shit, spit on them, chase  them out, and wonder why we couldn't get another guest?  And slam the door, and stay out.  And stay out.  And then we would laugh and laugh and laugh. 
[00:51:30]  Because it was funny.  And then for weeks, we'd be like, hey, here's our celebrity guest phone.  No one would come by.  Screech is stopping by.  Right.  And Steve the Whistler.  Yeah, great.  And Kathy Griffin.  There's a big get.  Great.  I got to take my, Anthony, you just amaze me when you pull these off.  It's like, you're able to talk.  I'm a speechless, fucking worthless nothing.  We all know that.  Just sit there.  All I'm thinking, don't fuck it up. 
[00:52:00]  Don't fuck it up.  Don't fuck it up.  You can talk to anybody.  It's amazing to watch.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And be funny and interesting.  I can't.  Ant's doing the driving.  It's amazing to watch.  Ant's doing the driving, and I got the map out.  Jimmy.  I got the map out.  We got to take a right.  Right here.  Right now.  Go.  But I'm curled up in the backseat car sick.  I know.  Growing up with a face full of acne and the afro I had, I better have been able to talk.  Dude, it's amazing how.  I was never getting laid.  Even Ozzy, who I know everything about, I couldn't talk to.  And her, I know nothing about, I couldn't talk to. 
[00:52:30]  And you, with anybody, can just be interesting.  Thank you, Jimmy.  It was great to watch, man.  That was a lot of fun.  And I think back to the old days when these guests would come in, and they're happy to  be here.  They've done nothing wrong to us.  And we just kill them.  We just kill them for no reason.  And it makes for some fun radio, and everyone gets on the message boards afterwards and says,  oh, that was hilarious.  And then we have to pay for that for like a year.  Yeah.  Now, you know.  I like the new approach.  I got to be honest. 
[00:53:00]  Because their people are with them.  So they see it, and then they talk to their people when they leave, and they had a good  time.  That was cool.  And more people come in.  She came in.  The Pal Talk people saw this.  She came in.  All the publicists came marching in and managers.  She had how many people with her?  Five or six?  Five people, yeah.  Five people with her, just following her around.  And most of them piled into the studio.  Because we do have a bad reputation.  We have an awful reputation.  And that's when I said, you know, ah, the publicist.  And she was cool.  She kind of waved them off. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Waved them off.  And it was a great 15, 20 minutes.  I really enjoyed my time with her.  One false move, and they would have just ripped her out of here.  And goodbye.  Right.  Made some phone calls, and we'd have been back to screech.  See, and I don't want to confuse the issue.  If someone comes in, and they're just a raging ass, no problem.  We'll rip their heads off.  Yeah, it happens.  No fucking problem.  But I guess what we're trying to get away from is just ripping off people's heads that  we probably would have been friends with.  The right-off-the-bat bashing seems to have done badly for us. 
[00:54:00]  So we're trying to stay away from that.  I'd rather have someone like her, where all of a sudden she's having so much fun, she actually  fell out of her chair and was on the floor.  We got a video that'll be up on opianthony.com later today.  That was very, very cool.  And we got our pictures taken with her.  I got a photo with her, and I'm looking at it.  And I smiled, and I tried to be nice.  And I'm looking at her.  Like, she's obviously very tired.  She just woke up.  Yeah.  And it is amazing what genetics are.  I mean, just to stand there and look powerful and beautiful. 
[00:54:30]  And I'm a grown man who makes my living in front of people, and I'm a slumped fat pig.  I say this from time to time.  I discovered this when I first went down to South Beach.  There are people out there that just make you feel like a genetic disaster.  She makes you feel like a genetic disaster.  Yeah, what idiots are we to take pictures next to her?  I didn't even put, like, let's just put, yeah, let's put us next to her, and, yeah.  It's like taking dog shit and throwing it in a Lamborghini.  All right, get a shot.  You'll see my picture later.  I have a hoodie on, and I just put my hands in my pocket. 
[00:55:00]  I didn't even try.  I'm like, hey, just take this picture.  I'm not even going to attempt to try to look good.  You just kind of leaned in like, look, we all know I'm not fucking her.  All right, click.  I put my arm around her.  Hi.  I don't say a word during the interview, little fat-faced coward.  Just sit here.  Go ahead, guys, do the heavy lifting.  I'll pick up a check, too.  Let's say hi to Dan in Philly.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys, how's it going?  Hey.  Just want to compliment the guests you guys are getting.  The quality is definitely going up, and I think Milo was good, but I think Kevin Smith yesterday was just unbelievable. 
[00:55:30]  He was amazing.  It was great.  Kevin Smith gave us four hours of great radio yesterday.  We're thinking about rerunning that Kevin Smith show over the weekend, by the way.  And then she was great today, and she's not going to do Howie.  Kevin Smith's not going to do Howie.  The gold medalist isn't going to do Howie.  So we're on a nice roll.  Good job, guys.  Punching out.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris in North Carolina.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Man, she gave us energy, too.  We're all just like, ah! 
[00:56:00]  What's up, Chris?  You there?  Yes, sir.  Hey, I wanted to agree with you on the thing about your Anthony, especially, as far as an interviewer.  I mean, you guys, the one thing I love about you guys is you're all honest.  I mean, you might be a little flaky, but you're very honest.  We've made a little honesty out of you.  You definitely have the ability as an interviewer that really a lot of professional talking heads on television should really look to.  Oh, look at that.  My second career after we got fired again. 
[00:56:30]  But I'm saying, AntsAbility also is not just to be a good interviewer, but he can talk to people that, like, I mean, Harry knew something about, but he's, you know, he can talk to people that he's not a massive fan of.  He just has that great ability in an interviewer to be interesting and talk about video games and things like that, which is just, I sit here with my stupid mouth open watching it.  I'm getting all embarrassed, Jimmy.  Ooh, you're making me all flushed.  It is fun to watch Jimmy in these situations.  I've got to be honest with you, Jimmy.  I'm awful.  I mean, you know, in front of 2,000, 3,000 people, Jimmy's the fucking man. 
[00:57:00]  And all it takes is a hot, like, actress to sit down, and you are, like, you're eight years old again.  Yeah, it's awful.  It's unbelievable.  Little Jimmy Norton.  No, it would be great the next time, like, we have someone of her caliber in here.  Someone has to just film Jimmy.  Just film him through the whole process.  All right, Chris, thanks.  Hey, thank you.  Were you done?  I'm sorry, Chris.  We're barely listening.  I know.  Go ahead, buddy.  Say it again.  Huh?  The one thing I also wanted to say was that just Anthony's so well-rounded, you know, he knows a little bit about everything. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, we know.  We have to live with it.  Yeah.  I know you have to.  Thanks for bringing that up.  We get it.  So well from people from G. Gordon-Liddy all the way to Kevin Smith.  And then one other thing, Jimmy?  No, sir.  No, that's not.  Oh, boy.  Oh, sir, you tried.  Yeah, Anthony may be well-rounded.  Let's see Anthony jerk off on Craigslist until 2.30 in the morning and still make it in here by 7. 
[00:58:00]  We all have our talents.  That's right.  And that is not one of mine.  Let's go to Al the Trucker.  Al.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Al.  Hey, yesterday you guys touched on the stupid top 100 radio shows or radio personalities.  With everything going on yesterday, which was a great show, you never got to tell us where you guys fit in that.  Oh, in the top 100?  Okay.  All right.  We got the list. 
[00:58:30]  We'll continue with that now.  All right.  Oh, I'm not even kidding.  We'll continue with that now.  By the way, say hi to the people that I met on the message board, View Askew message board.  It's Kevin Smith's message board.  Went over there.  Saw that some people, a lot of people really enjoyed the interview with Kevin.  A couple of people, though, they got some people over there, don't particularly enjoy the Opie and Anthony program.  And we're bashing us, you know, Stern fans saying that we stank and stuff like that. 
[00:59:00]  And we're imitators probably.  And that Kevin is good friends.  They were saying a couple of people, Kevin's good friends with Howard, and he's been on Howard a lot, and they have a great friendship or something like that.  And Kevin came on and posted to clear up a little, I guess, something that happened.  Howard was caught in a little lie.  He was caught in a little lie.  No, Howard lying? 
[00:59:30]  It's something that concerned Kevin Smith.  Yeah.  He would call up or he would get on the air, and Howard would say that Kevin Smith keeps calling, asking to be on the air.  Remember the same thing he said about Jay Moore?  Yeah, which was a lie.  Oh, stop calling my show.  Like all these people that have great careers are calling him to try to get on the show.  And so he said Kevin had been calling trying to get on his show.  And Kevin's like, that was a lie.  Never happened.  And he won't do that show again. 
[01:00:00]  And he said, by the way, I had a great time on the Opie and Anthony show.  He goes, the guys over there are a lot of fun.  And he enjoyed himself here yesterday.  Very good.  And it shut the – you know how when message boards – you know when somebody posts on a message board that other people admire, all the jibber-jabber stops?  After that, there wasn't one more negative post.  No more jibber-jabber?  It was all, hey, Kevin, you sounded great on O&A.  I love O&A. 
[01:00:30]  They're great.  Because they know they'll get the Kevin boot.  The good old Kevin boot.  The Kevin boot up your ass.  Did he write about me?  No.  Hey, I want Ben to get Michael Harrison on the old phone today.  On the horn, Ope.  Uh-oh.  Michael Harrison from –  The blower, I like to call it.  From Talkers Magazine.  Get him on the blower.  Because, quite frankly, this is just ridiculous.  I know we piss off a lot of people in the business.  A lot, Ope.  And maybe this is payback, which is fine. 
[01:01:00]  But I would like the guy to come on our show and admit that it's some kind of payback.  Because Talkers Magazine is an industry rag that's pretty, pretty big out there.  Yeah.  In the industry.  For all the radio geeks.  Yeah, for all the radio geeks.  And they have their list of the top 100 talkers in America.  Top 100 talk shows in America.  I didn't even know there were 100.  That's what I'm getting at.  Ron Owens is up there.  Oh, well, and well, he should be.  Spike O'Dell.  Yeah, yeah, okay. 
[01:01:30]  Give me someone I don't know.  Well, Spike O'Dell, let me just read you this.  Oh!  This is what you're up against, though.  I should say we.  We're in this together.  Yeah.  Huge numbers in morning drive at one of America's heritage signals.  Great.  We're heard all over America, and we're heard in Canada now.  Now, you might ask, well, it's satellite.  Perhaps they're not addressing satellite radio.  Well, they threw Howard in the number one spot.  Okay, they threw Howard Stern in the number one spot.  But even that you can justify. 
[01:02:00]  And Bob Edwards is in here, too.  I know.  We'll get to that.  I just want to get to the, we got to mention the Daily News today about this.  This is how big this Talkers Magazine top 100 list is.  And Michael Harrison, I guess he's one of the guys that threw the list together.  We're already getting the flowers and the curses, says editor Michael Harrison.  The criteria, excuse me, for inclusion, according to the magazine, include courage.  What?  Courage.  We have courage.  Effort.  We have effort. 
[01:02:30]  Effort.  I get up every morning.  Impact.  We have an impact on our listeners.  People are getting laid because of our show.  Dammit.  Oh.  Longevity.  We have longevity.  82 years in the business for me.  82 years.  We have longevity.  Anthony and I have been at 11 or 12 years.  So we had to take about three of those years off.  Yeah, but it's, yeah.  Not like we've been in it five.  Right.  Longevity.  Potential.  Potential. 
[01:03:00]  There's great potential here.  That's right.  Ratings, recognition, service, talent, and uniqueness.  I think we fit a lot of that criteria.  Yeah, but the bottom line is you attacked commercial radio and that pissed a lot of people  off.  It's the attacks on commercial radio.  That's fine.  If that's the case, then come on our show.  He won't.  And admit it, Michael Harrison.  Michael Harrison, I got to tell you, you know, I pay attention.  The guy has said nice things about us in the past.  And when we got in trouble, they interviewed him on TV.  When we were coming back to Satellite, they interviewed him on TV. 
[01:03:30]  He's been quoted in a bunch of papers.  Based on that criteria, it could be subjective where you can say certain things about the show  that don't fit the criteria.  It wouldn't be true, but you could say it.  But, reading the list, there are shows here that I don't think would fit that criteria.  So, we did the top 30-something yesterday, but in case you missed it, we'll do the top 
[01:04:00]  10 according to Talkers Magazine.  It's Howie in first, Rush Limbaugh in second, Sean Hannity in third, Michael Savage in fourth,  Dr. Laura Schlesinger in fifth, Don Imus, our pal in sixth, Laura Ingram in seventh, Mike  Gallagher in eighth, Neil Bortz, who's just an asshole.  Yeah.  He had no problem trashing us when we fucked up, and he didn't know about us.  And tenth is Randy Rhodes, who is one of the hosts on Air America. 
[01:04:30]  We did a lot of the list yesterday.  We're going to continue with the list here.  And then, here we go.  This is in the Daily News article about the list, right?  Yeah.  Also, for the first time, Talkers listed 150 other hosts who didn't make the top 100.  Yeah.  And then, help.  And then they point us out.  We're the only ones they point out.  Fans of Opie and Anthony on XM, for instance, may be surprised to find they are only in that  second group. 
[01:05:00]  We get more reaction to this list than anything else we do, says Harrison.  So, they list, like, then, 150 other hosts, but not in an order.  Mm-hmm.  But we didn't make the top 100, is what we're getting at here.  No.  And then, I was reading email, and people were like, well, the reason you're not in the  top 100 is...  And they have all these stupid fucking excuses.  Ladies and gentlemen, angry typing guy.  Well, all right.  Well, how about...  You're missing the point, is what I'm saying to these assholes out there.  Whether you like or hate the show, we should be in the top 100. 
[01:05:30]  That's ridiculous, dude.  Okay?  I'm not even going to say, well, we should be first, we should be second, we should be  in the top 10.  I'm just saying we should be in the top 100.  Shit.  That's the point I'm making today.  So, for you to say, well, the reason is...  Shut the fuck up.  You know that I had a talk with Washington yesterday?  Because people are like, uh...  You know why our phones...  Did they say, uh...  Well, because I'm a little excited.  Talking with Frankenstein yesterday.  Uh...  I'm a little excited today.  Yeah.  You know why the phones blow up?  You know all of a sudden how, like, the phones, like, we have them all on hold, people 
[01:06:00]  ready to talk, and then...  And you'll hear a little pop, and they'll all be gone.  You hear the...  Yeah.  And the faithful listeners know what I'm talking about, and all of a sudden I'm like, holy  crap, the phones just went out?  You know why that's happened a lot in the last month or so?  Why?  We...  There are so many people calling our show that the system cannot handle it.  They have to build a whole new phone system.  They didn't expect this.  That is bittersweet, isn't it?  Because they couldn't figure it out...  Lemons, lemonade.  They couldn't figure it out at first, so they got down and really did a lot of research, 
[01:06:30]  and they realized the system they have in place they thought was good enough for our  show, it's not good enough for our show.  Too many people are calling this program, and the phone system cannot handle it.  So we're having a major impact and growing by leaps and bounds here.  Dude, you're no Fred Hansberger.  You're no Fred Hansberger.  All right, hold on.  So we're going to move on with...  Where do we leave off?  30s.  Who remembers?  John and Ken.  We did Tom Likas, right? 
[01:07:00]  We did Lionel.  We did...  We did...  All right, so let's start with 35.  Yeah, we are.  35.  If you want to know 1 through 35, then I don't know.  Oh, what's this guy's name again, by the way, from Talker Magazine?  It's Michael Harrison at Talker Magazine.  Talkers.  Talkers Magazine.  It's not just one guy.  They're Talkers.  Maybe somebody out there knows Michael and can call him and get him on the phone.  If any of the fans might know him, maybe they're friends with this guy.  Can you ask him?  I'm not going to beat him up.  I want to ask him why.  Yeah, let's get him on the air.  Supposedly his office doesn't open until 9, but we're going to try to get him on. 
[01:07:30]  Ask him why we didn't fit the pressure.  So the heavy 100 in 35th place is Bev Smith, the leader in Urban Issues Talk Radio, syndicated  in more than 25 markets.  Would that be 26?  Why don't they say how many markets she's syndicated in?  Why are they saying more than 25?  More than 25.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Right.  Why don't they just list how many?  36 is Mike and the Mad Dog here in New York City.  Mike and the Mad Dog on a fan, the fathers of contemporary sports talk radio. 
[01:08:00]  For over 15 years, there's ratings of other new leaders in New York City there, Mike.  Then you got Neil Rogers.  Her dog.  Neil Rogers is a talk show host out of Miami.  He's in 37th place.  Then you got Roger Hedgecock.  All right, just for the name.  All right.  I give this, I pardon you.  Who the fuck is Roger Hedgecock?  And why is he on the list and we're not?  Turn the TV off.  Roger Hedgecock is talking. 
[01:08:30]  Hedgecock.  Then you got Jerry Doyle in 39th place.  Politically independent generalist and colorful character with more than 2.5 million weekly  listeners.  From Central Point, Oregon.  Then you got Tony Snow from Fox News.  Then you got our pal G. Gordon Liddy.  G. Gordon Liddy, who I think should be in the top 100.  He's in 41st place.  Then you got Lars Larson.  What?  Lars Larson?  Larry Elder?  Larry Elder.  Another Stephanie Miller, who used to work with Brother Weeds. 
[01:09:00]  Very, very talented talk show host.  Oh, yeah?  I got to tell you.  She used to be known as Sister Sleaze back in the day.  45th place, Howie Carr.  See, I had to put Howie Carr on this list.  But, I can understand that, because I've heard of Howie Carr.  Fuck Howie Carr.  He's a talk show host in Boston.  I once listened to him do a whole segment on what was your favorite fucking ice cream.  Yeah, but wasn't it us who did a segment on him doing a segment on your favorite ice cream? 
[01:09:30]  No, but I actually heard him doing it.  I know.  It was hysterical.  I really did.  He just took calls from people, you know, telling them their favorite ice cream.  Yeah, Howie?  Yeah, you're on the air.  What's your favorite ice cream flavor?  Pistachio.  I like pistachio.  Ah, I like that pistachio, too.  See, I like more of a creamy ice cream.  I don't like nuts being in it.  That's what it was for a half hour.  Howie fucking Carr.  Then you got Mike and Mike, ESPN Radio, Phil Hendry, who's pretty talented. 
[01:10:00]  He's in 47th place.  Wow, what is 48th?  The fucking Satellite Sisters made the list and we didn't.  Five holes on one show?  Five holes in one.  You ought to call that show Swiss Cheese.  A unique slant on issues and relationships with Dolan Sisters, Julie, Liz, Sheila, Monica,  and Leanne.  A unique slit on issues and relationships.  A unique slant?  Is it unique?  What's unique about it?  What's unique about it?  Do you ladies get a little saucy with your talk?  Oh, dare to dream. 
[01:10:30]  Five kvetching hens.  Is one the whore on the show?  Ugh.  Yeah.  It's like Sex and the City on the radio.  I guarantee they all go, you know, you're like Samantha.  What, an old whore?  Well, you know, Dolores called me.  Oh, you know, she's saucy.  Speaking of holes, my hole was worked over last night by a stockbroker.  I'm stealing my brother's impression, but the fucker won't leave his house to do it, 
[01:11:00]  so I gotta do it.  That is hysterical.  I heard about that.  My brother does the best Samantha impression from fucking Sex and the City where everything  has to go back to sex.  Everything, that old slut, that old fucked out whore.  You know, you got Sarah Jessica Parker going, oh, I had a hard day today.  Speaking of hard, the plumber came by and he gave me something hard all night long.  Ugh.  Shut up. 
[01:11:30]  You want to take a seat, Samantha?  I can't sit all day.  I was sitting on a hard cock all night long.  You know.  I was doing a backward cowgirl.  Ugh.  Had some sex last night.  Just put it this way.  I was staring at the pillow.  Right.  I won't be sitting for a week.  Oh, I get it, Samantha.  You got fucked in the ass.  Fantastic.  Speaking of biting, what do you mean speaking of biting?  No one even brought that up.  I know, but I was biting the pillow last night. 
[01:12:00]  I watched that fucking Sex and the City to get annoyed.  I've said this on the show and I can't find anyone else that does this with TV.  I watch shows that piss me off and I love getting pissed off.  Yeah, you like getting annoyed.  The other fucking one I hate is that Lisa Loeb show on VH1.  Never saw it.  Number one single.  Never.  Holy crap, what horse shit.  Never.  She's a 37-year-old ex-pop star moving back to New York to find a husband and be famous again. 
[01:12:30]  Ooh.  Is it a reality show?  Yes.  And she's got these girlfriends that walk around like they're the Sex and the City cast.  Yuck.  One's her sister and one's like a real-life Samantha.  Oh.  They actually did a scene where she's in some coffee shop in Soho and her friend was wearing  a hat that was so big and ridiculous and fuzzy.  I'm like, this is-  A big hat.  This has to be a joke, but no, I'm sure it's some kind of stupid fashion statement.  I'd like to be a fly on the wall and listen to what the Satellite Sisters are talking about. 
[01:13:00]  When they get gabbing.  Oh, you don't want to be on their bad side.  Oh, you wouldn't want to be a fly on my wall last night, I gotta tell you.  With all the jism on my wall, they would just stick there like flypaper.  Fucking, we get it.  The Satellite Sisters.  Satellite Sisters.  Has anybody heard of them?  Honestly, I think I've heard of the name.  I get it.  Then in 49th place is Dennis Prager. 
[01:13:30]  And anybody wondering, yes, we are bitter.  A leading moralist and intellectual in the issues talk industry.  Looks like a moralist.  Yeah.  Michael Harrison-  Which, by the way, is the same look as a kid toucher.  Michael Harrison, explain why Dennis Prager's on the list and we're not, please.  He will not come on the show or he'll have some smug answer.  None of these guys, you know, get national, a lot of these guys don't get national attention.  We're in a ton of articles.  We're making a, you know, in the end, we don't really care.  We just want to know why.  Number 52 will explain exactly why. 
[01:14:00]  But you don't want to deal with that.  You guys will jump right over it.  You don't want to face that.  Let's move on.  50 is Neil Conan.  Oh, by the way, we're going right to 100.  So if you think this is boring, go to Deep Track.  That's right.  Go to fucking Audio Visions.  Tune to another channel.  Neil Conan hosts NPR's premiere afternoon issue talk show, Talk of the Nation.  Then you got Doug McIntyre.  McIntyre.  I can't even pronounce some of the guys on this list. 
[01:14:30]  It looks like McIntyre, doesn't it?  Yes, it does.  That's wacky McIntyre name.  Well, it's Doug McIntyre.  It's McIntyre.  Number 52, you guys want to deal with some competition?  Go ahead.  Jump over it.  Now, this guy should be way up on the list.  Holy shit.  Number 52.  See, they describe each show.  Holy crap, I'm going to puke.  It's Rusty Humphreys, everybody.  Rusty Humphreys.  That's kind of like a rusty trombone.  But you've heard of a rusty trombone.  I'm giving her the old Rusty Humphreys.  That's right. 
[01:15:00]  That's when she licks your ass, jerks you off, and then you're both so bored you fall asleep.  Speaking of Rusty Humphreys, I had the Rusty Trombone last night.  He fucked me in the ass, and then I gave him a blowjob.  Oh, that's when you get, that's when you get, uh, you get, uh, right, right.  Well, but no, I punched out.  I didn't see you punching out, but I went.  It was three times there, Porky Pig.  That was my internal mechanism while Mila was sitting here. 
[01:15:30]  Before we get back to Rusty Humphreys.  Let's make sure we do.  I need water really bad, by the way.  Can I say hi to Frank in Kentucky?  Frank?  Yeah.  Hi, Frank.  Yeah, you guys had the Satellite Sisters on your show, man.  We did?  Did we?  Yeah.  Wow, that was memorable.  They were walking by, man.  What?  Yeah, I had to call you out on that shit, man.  Wait, wait, wait.  We never had them on our show.  When did we have them on?  Seriously.  Oh, shit, a few weeks ago, man.  A few weeks back, I heard you guys.  You mean the chicks in D.C.?  Yeah, man.  That's not the Satellite Sisters. 
[01:16:00]  No, that's, uh, that's a show that XM's doing that, uh, is trying to imitate the Satellite Sisters.  You dickhead.  Yeah, broad-minded.  Thank you, Derek.  By the way, uh, the picture...  I'm banning someone in lieu of him.  Oh, no.  I'm just going to Paltalk and banning an anonymous person because he screwed up.  No, don't do it.  Don't do it.  Okay, I pardon you.  Don't do it, you crazy fuck.  He really is a kook.  Love wielding power.  I know you do.  I have none.  We also noticed that... 
[01:16:30]  Yes?  What happened?  It's all right, Derek.  Honestly, I'll be totally honest with Derek right now.  Uh-oh.  And I don't want to.  Here we go.  I was going to, like, uh, you know, do a one-liner about Anthony, and I knew it was going to suck  so fucking bad, and you just saved me by talking in my ear so I could stop and go,  What, Derek?  Thank you, Derek.  What was the line?  Thank you.  I'm not even going to say it.  Why?  I...  Because it didn't make sense on any level.  Well, if you say that, it's not as big as if you speak it out after the fact in non-joke 
[01:17:00]  words.  I'm trying to think of it because he was doing a goatee thing.  I was going to try to make a Hitler goatee joke where it's getting, you know, tighter  and tighter, but see, yeah, exactly.  Uh, what do you got, Derek?  You're all flustered.  Ever since Rusty Humphreys came up, everybody's flustered.  Just seeing Rusty Humphreys at number 52 shook me up a bit, too.  Oh, okay.  Where do you see his description, though?  You guys want to play games?  I think that guy that was trying to...  Remember the guy we saw recently using his testicles to bang the dildo into his asshole? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  After you do that long enough, you'll get a big pair of Rusty Humphreys hanging down there.  Because that seems to be something of the anus and testicles.  Speaking of testicles, let me tell you.  You should have saw what was banging off my asshole.  Hey, I think they're enjoying the Samantha impression.  Oh, they're committing to it.  I like it.  And even the promos for it are awful.  Like on TBS, TBS presents Sex in the City. 
[01:18:00]  And the girls will talk, and I'll be left, like, with my jaw hitting the floor going,  what did they just...  I have no idea what that's all about.  Know what the best part of Sex in the City is?  Sarah Jessica Parker is nowhere near hot or sexy.  No.  But they make her look like she's the hottest one on the show, right?  Yeah.  And the hippest one.  So all of a sudden, they'll be walking down some dumb street in New York City as a group.  And Sarah Jessica Parker has a dress on that would be really, really nice. 
[01:18:30]  Except for the fact that she has an eight-foot fucking flower hanging off her shoulder.  Because that's somehow fashionable.  Fashionable.  That you don't know fashion.  Or all of a sudden, you know, she has a really nice sundress on, whatever.  But a huge fucking hat that doesn't make sense.  Because we're too stupid to understand, right?  Sundress.  I fucked my boyfriend's son the other night.  Hey, hey, hey.  It's my impression.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  I don't have many impressions.  Let me have the Samantha on this.  All right. 
[01:19:00]  I'll give you the Samantha.  Actually, it's my brother's.  I can't even take credit for it.  Dave in San Diego.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, fella.  Oh.  Hey, I just give you...  Roger Hedgecock was the ex-corrupt mayor of San Diego.  They threw him at all.  Really?  Oh, really?  I promise a cock in every hedge.  Mayor Hedgecock.  Let's go to Lori the trucker.  Lori.  Frank and Bush.  Lori, hurry up, because we've got to get back to the list.  We're up to Rusty Humphreys.  Okay, I'll talk really fast.  The show you're describing is broad-minded. 
[01:19:30]  At least they try to be edgy.  Yeah.  But Satellite Sisters is also on XM.  They're on that Take Five.  And I'll just tell you what their Valentine's show was.  All right.  They had on two brothers.  One guy wrote the book.  He was stood up at the altar by his soon-to-be wife.  And he decided to take his brother on his honeymoon with him.  And they went on a year-and-a-half honeymoon together.  Two brothers.  And that was their Valentine's Day show.  So, if that sounds interesting... 
[01:20:00]  Hey, guys.  We can't compete with that.  Yeah.  We should accept the fact that we're not in the top 100, though.  With bits like that.  If anybody out there knows Michael Harrison from Talker's Magazine...  I think he would probably come on our show.  Seriously.  He's not one of these guys that would hide.  He loves the attention.  He loves being on TV.  Well, you know, maybe you're right about he's not being one of these guys who would hide.  But he's still inherently dishonest by what he did.  I absolutely agree.  And, you know, this gives fodder to the people that hate us.  Like, ha-ha, look. 
[01:20:30]  Look, look.  You guys didn't even make the top 100.  They know.  But, I mean, come on.  Some of the names on here, it's not even a question.  That we're better than.  Can I tell you something?  It's better you didn't make the top 100 than showing up 88th.  Simply because it's so obvious.  The list goes to 250, and we're somewhere in between 100 and 250.  No, no, no.  Don't even tell us.  What I'm saying is, you understand what I mean?  It's such an obvious reason.  It's almost like if in the Godfather...  If Cuckoo's Nest had been shut out of the Oscars.  Oh, okay. 
[01:21:00]  We all know exactly what's going on.  Right.  Rusty Humphreys.  Here's the description.  Multi-talented conservative talker produces own parody songs.  Holy shit.  A conservative talk show that makes his own song parodies.  We gave up on parody songs years ago.  That's got to be hysterical.  That's what we need to do.  We need more parody songs.  More parodies.  Wait till we get to the next one.  This is when other comedy duos come in.  I mean, I can understand why these guys are here and you're not. 
[01:21:30]  Hey, 53 was top 100 talkers in number 53.  Oh, God.  This show must be...  You know, how can they get so much shit?  How can they evoke so much negative emotion from me by two lines of a description of a show?  So, Bob and Sherry from WLNK.  Oh, my God.  Bob Lacey and Sherry Lynch, leaders in female targeted talk. 
[01:22:00]  Female targeted talk.  Look at the picture of Bob.  What a castrated...  I just love hanging out with the girls.  What a castrated fact.  Oh, of course.  And it says AM Drive in Charlotte and now syndicated.  Oh, my God.  A morning guy-girl drive team out of Charlotte.  Fucking Michael Harrison, you dishonest scumbag.  He's not...  She's not even the hole for the show.  It's like a female show. 
[01:22:30]  So, he's the hole.  He's the hole.  He's the hole.  He's the meat.  They probably all tease her.  Why do you have to have meat on your show?  Meat on your show.  You're ruining it.  Speaking of meat.  He's always cackling.  I kind of like that impression.  I want to do it.  Give it a try, Jim.  No.  It has to happen.  I can't just do impersonations.  Hold on, right?  You guys got to see Bob and Sherry's website.  They're wearing the same clothes, everybody.  No, stop it.  Go back one.  Oh, my God.  When they're lounging around.  Watch. 
[01:23:00]  In there.  Go back another one.  They won't let you go back again?  They won't let you.  Because the one is...  They're laying down for their publicity shot.  They're both wearing red turtlenecks.  Yeah, watch this.  No?  Maybe?  Why wouldn't I let you go back there?  It's opening.  Slow down.  You know what?  Everyone's killing the website.  Probably a lot of people hitting it now.  Everyone's killing the website.  Yeah, I'm sure if Bob and Sherry talk about a website, it just crashes.  Oh, look at Bob's hairdo.  Oh!  Dude, Bob's hair.  Bob's hairdo. 
[01:23:30]  I've never actually wanted to see Alzar Cowie holding a severed head as much as I want  to see that fucking Lego person hairdo.  How do I get in?  I don't know.  Bob and Sherry.  You got to see the other shot.  They're lounging.  The one guy's...  Anthony's got it up over there.  I know.  They're lounging with their...  And they're wearing the same clothes.  Yeah, that's the one.  The black pants, the red shirt.  I, uh...  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at him.  You poor son of a bitch. 
[01:24:00]  Shoot yourself, Bob.  Bob, be a man and take off that red turtleneck.  That's right.  Just black in her eye, Bob.  What's going on?  Is that...  Wouldn't it be great if Bob just one day said,  Sherry, shut the fuck up and punched her right in the face.  And they lost their entire audience.  Let's go to Jerry in North Carolina.  Jerry, what's up?  Hey, uh, that Rusty Humphrey, he's so lame  that he actually took the Team America theme song  and changed it for his intro music.  It goes, Rusty, heck yeah, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:24:30]  Can we get a Rusty Humphrey song parody, please?  Can we please?  Can someone get us a Rusty Humphrey parody immediately?  Get me a goddamn Rusty Humphrey song parody.  Somebody get me a Rusty Humphrey song before I fucking die.  By the way, Jerry Doyle used to play Garibaldi on Babylon 5.  We all know Jerry Doyle.  Who doesn't know Jerry Doyle?  Yeah, no kidding.  I'm a hero.  All right, we're getting a Rusty Humphrey's song parody.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you. 
[01:25:00]  You gotta pay for it?  You gotta pay for his parody, sir?  How much for a parody?  It's worth it.  You have to be a premium member.  Well then...  God damn it.  Bring me a member.  This motherfucker thinks he's Rush Limbaugh.  He's Rusty.  He looks like him.  He's a fat man with glasses.  And I want to hear his songs.  Rusty Humphrey's, you gotta pay to get in there?  Of course you do.  Hawk, pay the man.  Pay him right now.  Fuck.  You're paying for it?  Let us listen to this shit.  Let's go to Duke in Little Rock.  Well, maybe someone out there has a Rusty song I could email.  Hey, guys, what's going on? 
[01:25:30]  Yes, let's go, Duke.  Hey, what's going on?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, fella.  Hey, just gonna agree with you on the sex in the city.  That is...  I mean, that just shows forced women and the morals.  I'm not a big moralist or anything like that, but I don't let my girls watch it.  Yeah.  Oh, he dove.  He dove on that wreckage.  Wow.  That was through the window. 
[01:26:00]  Back to the list.  Back to the windshield.  In 54th place, it's Mitch Albom.  Mitch Albom.  Albom.  Albom.  A-L-B-O-M.  It's not Albom.  It's Albom.  He wrote a nice book.

Uh, yeah, we're looking at the heavy hundred, the top 100 talkers in America and your pals  Opie and Anthony did not make the list.  56th place is a guy, I can't even pronounce his last name.

[01:30:30]  What's up, Josh?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got to call you guys out on Rusty.  I think you guys would actually love this guy.  Stop it.  Rusty.  Heck yeah.  You're right, sir.  We would.  We will know in a matter of seconds.  That's right.  Why, sir?  What are you saying about Rusty?  This guy actually flew over to a fucking terrorist house in Israel and made fun of them to their  damn faces.  And he does racial humor and all kinds of other shit.  You guys flew over to a terrorist house?  Do you think, oh, oh, oh, my God. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, you poor man.  All right.  Explain.  I'm telling you guys, you fucking did it.  All right.  Please.  Dude, dude.  Please explain it in great detail to us what actually happened.  Because we know everything about radio.  We're going to tear down the eighth wall for you today.  This guy, he sets up for two weeks in advance about a big trip they're going to take and  everything.  And he's got all his sister affiliates or whatever over there in Israel for his right-wing  bullshit.  All right.  Okay.  He goes over there and they got this one dude knows this terrorist faction that's trying 
[01:31:30]  to get some publicity.  So they invite him over to their house.  Right.  And he goes over there and he's asking them all kinds of questions.  He's basically, you know, doing the whole making fun of these fuckers in their face.  Uh-huh.  And he says, you know, they got guns to his head and everything.  And they were actually surprised that anybody would be able to talk to him like, man.  And these guys were fucking pointing guns at his head.  And yeah, he went over there and he called them out when they did.  Were they really pointing guns at his head?  Oh my God. 
[01:32:00]  Sir, I don't...  You could be the dumbest human being I've ever spoken to.  I don't...  I mean, dude, I'm rifling through 37 years of conversation and you really are the forefront  for the dumbest motherfucker I've ever spoken to.  Well, let's play this out, Josh.  So the guns are pointed at his head.  Yeah.  Why didn't they shoot?  They are terrorists after all and they don't have to follow any real rules.  Well, the reason why...  Or laws.  ...is that he promised them an airtime.  What?  He was giving them airtime on his show. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, so...  Okay, wait a minute.  So they said the terrorists in the West Bank wanted to do a drive-time show and what's...  Where is he?  He is in...  He's in their house.  No, no, no.  Answer, airtime.  Where is he syndicated to?  Like, what city are you in?  I have no idea.  Well, he plays on XM-166 American Rights.  Okay, so they wanted to talk to Rusty Humphreys.  So he went into a terrorist house, they pointed guns, and he made fun of them to their faces. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, he even called them out on not doing the call to prayer.  When the call to prayer went down, none of them stopped to pray or anything.  And he even called them out on that.  And what did they do, sir?  Were they all flustered?  No, they were totally serious.  They just wanted to make it look like they were victims and everything.  Yeah.  Well, Josh is on the...  I mean, this was a serious interview.  Josh, what's up?  Hey, dude.  What's going on, guys?  You're on with, uh...  Wow, wait.  Two Joshes?  Yeah, dude.  Josh and Josh.  Josh and Josh.  You're number 78, by the way. 
[01:33:30]  I'm way better, dude.  Anyways, I just wanted to say, dude, back in the day, Rusty Humphreys used to do about  10, 12 years ago, back when I was about 10 years old or so, used to work on a morning  show here on a Top 40 station.  And they were doing a remote at a sporting goods store, dude.  And like I said, I was a young kid.  And they were giving out Mountain Dews and pizzas and shit.  And this bastard, dude, I just walked up and he had him in his hole that they had on the  radio station.  You know, this was a while back, but still. 
[01:34:00]  And this bastard was just...  I mean, I was a young kid and he was a total ass to me, dude.  I just wanted to come up and get a slice of pizza, maybe, because they were giving away  free pizzas and sodas and shit.  And this asshole was just a total ass to me, dude.  It pissed me off, man.  Josh, number one, I apologize.  For Josh, number two, to think that was important enough to call a national talk show, he has  aced you out for dumbest human being I've ever spoken to.  But he does have talk skills.  You should be 80th on this list.  Or did you make that joke with 78? 
[01:34:30]  I know, when he said, when I said Josh and Josh, I said you guys are 78.  Okay, very good.  Because I heard something in there.  Jeff in North Carolina.  Hey, you ready for Bob and Sherry?  Yeah.  Okay, hold on.  Here comes Bob and Sherry, one of the shows that beat us out.  You're not going to change your mind.  I'm too old.  How old are you?  I'm pushing 60.  Yeah, but do you want to be here for 30 more years?  No.  Well, you're on the right diet and the right health plan.  No, I don't want to be around here. 
[01:35:00]  I want out of this hell.  I love you, Linda.  What is so bad about your life that you can't wait to escape it?  Just old.  I'm, you know, not a lot.  You're getting tired.  Yeah.  You're not old.  You're not old.  You're really not old, Linda.  You just feel old.  Maybe she's packed a lot in and she's just ready to check out.  Are you encouraging, are you encouraging Linda to step through the veil of tears?  Please stop.  Put one more nail in the coffin.  This is, I know, this is the two of you.  This is the first. 
[01:35:30]  You're the first radio person I said, you know what, to a listener.  You know what, go ahead and die.  I probably will.  Oh, jeez.  You know that, you know it's going to happen.  That impacts us.  You know, the thing is with Linda, you're going to lecture and get all up in your face.  That impacts us.  This voice is higher than hers.  She's going to start eating a spoonful of pure fat.  I hope this fucking Bob McAllister looking jerk off is paralyzed in a boating accident.  Oh, you warm up the fat.  Right.  They say it tastes better. 
[01:36:00]  Linda, how many cigarettes do you smoke a day?  Don't lie to me because I'm going to tell you what.  At least it's high energy, the show.  You're lying and saying overpass?  Is that enough?  No.  You want more?  Please, sir.  It could be.  Okay, hold on.  How many of you had?  I don't work on the radio.  Do you work at all?  No.  It's not even like so bad that it's good.  Does your husband still work?  It's so nothing. 
[01:36:30]  It is nothing radio.  You're listening to the hole in the donut.  Yeah.  This is the space in the donut.  The hole in the donut.  A nice little analogy there.  Does that contribute in any way to your...  Oh, don't blame us on that.  This is nothing.  Linda's bored.  I mean, she needs to take her life up a little bit.  She needs to...  You and your husband are in a rut, aren't you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well, how can she...  How did they get into this call?  How do you fall into a call like this?  You're in a groove, and neither one of you really wants to do anything all that radically different. 
[01:37:00]  Why don't you try a different position tonight, Linda?  Ooh.  Saucy.  Ooh.  I know the one I'd choose.  Or maybe not.  Give it to her.  Something funny?  Yep.  Hey, Linda, how many cigarettes...  Get out that bomb.  How many cigarettes...  Yeah.  How many cigarettes are funny?  She's laughing too hard to talk.  I don't know. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  You're a hoot.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  And I think that's a very expensive up here.  All right.  I can't take any more.  I want Bob and Sherry.  Goodbye, Bob and Sherry.  Fuck Bob and Sherry.  By the way, getting back to...  Speaking of Sherry, I had some.  Hey.  I was a drunk and sucked a guy's cock.  Oh.  That's my impression.  What? 
[01:38:00]  I do impersonations.  I do it so good you'd think it was the real people.  I can see how a girl could fall for him.  All right.  Listen.  Rusty Humphreys.  Give him back to Rusty Humphreys.  Rusty Humphreys.  Please.  A little more info.  Rusty sells ringtones, shirts, alarm clocks, collector coins, and his own coffee.  Oh, my God.  His own coffee.  Rusty is a whore.  I say correct that I love Rusty Humphreys.  Also, he sells the Holy Land Pack.  What?  Which is earth, oil, and water.  What? 
[01:38:30]  Minerals, salt, and mud.  Oh, my God.  He does.  It's on his website.  He sold it to Bob Edwards as betting.  For $9.99, you can get the Holy Land In Your Hand Pack.  Material, earth, water, and oil.  Price is $9.99.  Sale price is $6.99.  Holy shit.  Fucking Jimmy.  We'll be back after this. 
[01:39:00]  After this short break of 200 years.  That's nothing for him.  All right.  We go back to Rusty Humphreys.  Yeah, please.  I got to hear some Rusty Humphreys.  What was he on the list again?  He's 52, top talkers in America.  He's two.  And he does his own song parodies like this fine little ditty called Blowing Up Saddam is  the Thing to Do.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  Rockin'.  Don't take no gobs from the Rack to Dump.  Come on, George, we'll drop a big old bomb.  Cause if he lives and I'll be blue.  Blowing up the dumps are things to do.  Remember when he dropped hot to catch.  Right then and there we should have kicked his ass.  Just think of all that we've been through. 
[01:40:00]  Blowing up's a dump's a thing to do.  They say that killin' Saddam's hard to do.  Turn it off.  Yeah, I know.  Know that it's true.  Turn it off!  There's no way he can do it today.  And I don't give a fuck about what the U.S. members say.  I'll beg of you to let it breathe again.  Let it still live my love. 
[01:40:30]  Please, can we keep that?  Because if Michael Harrison from Talkers Magazine, maybe again, maybe some of the listeners know  him, maybe one of his friends with him and can contact him for us, calls, I would like  to have that song parody.  Oh, play it for him.  To play that and say to him, explain to me what is funny or interesting about this.  Can we take a little leak?  Oh, wow.  And we'll continue with the list.  We're up to 64.  Bob Edwards made the list.  Your pals, Opie and Anthony, did not make the top. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, let's break and we'll continue with this dumb list and other things.  What?  Hawk, what are you doing?  All right.  I signal.  I thought he was trying to.  Hawk's mysterious.  Hawk, what are you doing? 
[01:41:30]  We're doing a virus spreading across America.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  We haven't met this to the dry earth.  It was said many, many years ago that Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Don't you forget that. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, by the way, Tim, who's our intern who drives from Springfield, Massachusetts every  day.  No joke.  We're broadcasting from New York City, so you can MapQuest it yourself to realize that  this guy's a complete lunatic.  It's insane to drive that far.  He's married with a little kid and he said, fuck all that.  I want to intern on the Opie and Anthony program.  So he drives every day from Springfield to do the show with us.  That's crazy.  Right?  Springfield.  Every day.  Right, Ben?  Springfield, Massachusetts.  Also the home of Talkers Magazine. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're in Springfield.  Oh, yeah.  Here's Tim.  Tim, how close are you to a divorce from doing this internship?  I've backed away a little bit from the internship to spend some time with my son and wife.  I'm here two days a week now.  Two days?  Yeah.  And let me ask you something.  Go ahead.  That didn't happen because you came home one day and said, you know, I'm really not spending  enough time with the family.  Something happened.  You got home one day. 
[01:43:00]  What was that argument like?  It wasn't a direct argument.  It was going to be an argument if, and I just, I did miss my son, to be honest with  you, but it was going to be an argument if I didn't take care of a few things.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, see, it wasn't, it might not have been an argument, but your wife probably suggested.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You wouldn't voluntarily give up some intern hours here.  No.  Yeah.  Your wife interferes.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  She needs to be corrected.  She needs a talking to.  I got a few things thrown at me.  Perhaps a bit more, if I may be so bosa.  So bosa.  If you don't mind my saying so.  So polite.  Struck him how to kill his wife and son with an axe.  So, Tim, what'd you bring us today?  Your son's a willful boy.  A very willful intern.  We're going to test out the way we're going to do the egg-eating contest at the Hard Rock.  Yes, we are.  Pat from Minaki's taking on all comers. 
[01:44:00]  All newcomers, old comers.  He's a pro, though.  Yeah.  Pat.  So, eh.  We're doing a broadcast at the Hard Rock Cafe.  St. Paddy's Day.  What?  11 a.m. to 2 p.m., I think?  Yeah.  When the hell is St. Paddy's Day?  17th, right?  I think that's on a Friday, if I'm not mistaken.  Two weeks from this Friday.  Oh, shit.  Really?  On a Friday this year?  Yeah, we haven't been out and about in a while, so we're looking forward to broadcasting live  and all the freaks are going to be there, all the new characters are going to be there,  including Schizo Bill from Cleveland. 
[01:44:30]  What about Half a Hulk Face?  Were we able to get him?  Hopefully, we'll get Half a Hulk Face.  What's that?  Working on it.  Working on Half a Hulk Face?  He better be there.  Big A and Twitchels and Pat from Minaki's going to do the hard-boiled egg-eating contest.  And they're colored green.  Nice.  And we forgot about this.  Like his toes.  And usually, we do these experiments.  Jesus.  I didn't hear you.  I didn't listen.  Very funny.  I was looking at my phone full apart.  We usually do these experiments in the Opie and Anthony lab.  Yeah.  In the lab, right. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, we like to-  A testing facility.  We like to work out all the bugs before we take things to our finds.  What we call the Opie and Anthony Institute.  That's right.  Yeah, we take it down there and check it out.  So Tim realized, this is why we like this guy, Tim.  He realized that we want to do this, and we kind of dropped the ball.  So he said, you know what?  Fuck that.  I'm not going to wait for these guys to ask for hard-boiled eggs.  I'm going to bring them in on my own today.  And that's what he did.  I need to know how many to bring to St. Paddy's eggs.  I'm going to be the one.  My company is going to be supplying them for us.  So I need to know how many to buy. 
[01:45:30]  You're a company?  Company.  Company.  I work for Big White Foods in Springfield, Mass.  It's a supermarket.  Oh.  Well.  Yes.  What do you do there?  Did we get a little bonus for mentioning them tonight?  No.  What do you do there?  I was the seafood manager.  The seafood manager?  I was the seafood manager.  What's that?  It's a manager.  Yeah, but what do you manage?  The seafood department.  I understand it's a seafood because you're the seafood manager.  What does that job entail?  I run the seafood department. 
[01:46:00]  How is that run?  How is it run?  What's the most important thing you have to do in the seafood management job that you  have?  Show up.  Show up.  That was like a little joke.  Do you get mad if the shrimps are stacked next to the salmon instead of near the oysters?  Yeah, you can't do that.  What do you go?  Hey, this trout's been here too long.  Yeah, you got to throw it out.  And why aren't you the seafood manager anymore?  I am here.  Your assistant to the assistant seafood manager.  Did I ever tell you that I was on a seafood diet? 
[01:46:30]  Really, Jimmy?  What was that?  Pussy.  He hurt my neck.  It was going one way.  I thought it was going, whoa.  A little whiplash for Anthony.  I pulled a little, oh, what's his name?  I pulled a little Rusty Humphreys on you.  Did you?  You think I'm going to be funny and interesting?  And I'm just rusty.  Just rusty.  You think he says that? 
[01:47:00]  Oh, I'm a little rusty this morning.  Mind me.  Rusty Wednesdays.  My mouth's a little rusty.  I can't pronounce things tonight.  Fucking half his body should just shut down.  Tim.  Tim.  Yes.  All right.  So what do you got?  You got five dozen eggs here, all colored green.  We got 60 eggs.  I think we want to get a medium of how many eggs an average person can eat.  Did you stay up all night to dye those eggs?  My son helped me, yeah.  Aw.  A little quality time for 10 minutes before you take off for New York again. 
[01:47:30]  Now, I know, I've seen egg eating contests on the TV.  Yeah.  Oh, beyond the TV.  And they're shelled, aren't they?  Aren't all the eggs shelled?  Those are shelled.  Yeah, they're shelled.  Those are...  Yeah.  No, I mean...  Oh, you want them out of the shell?  The shell's taken off.  Yeah, that's why I wasn't sure.  Like shelled.  Isn't that weird?  If something is shelled, you have taken the shell off.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Well, you know, I think it'll make the contest a little more interesting that they have to 
[01:48:00]  quickly, you know, peel this thing.  Oh, it certainly will if a big piece of eggshell gets lodged in someone's fucking throat.  Are they hard-boiled?  Yeah.  Okay.  So what are we doing?  We're going to try this out?  Yeah.  You and who?  Bill?  Yeah.  Bill weighs 120 pounds.  Yeah, but he's got heart, that kid.  Anybody else want to try this out?  Don't do anything.  Why aren't they peeled already?  Do we want to do that for the contest?  It might be hard to peel.  No, honestly, it doesn't matter because after a while, they're not going to be able to just 
[01:48:30]  keep shoving them in their mouth.  They're going to need a little time.  Oh, so it's not going to be a timed event thing like that?  And you know what?  It comes down to technique.  You know, you have one in your mouth, then you're taking the shell off the next one.  I think we'll be fine with the shells.  Okay.  All right.  Because we want to keep the eggs green to make it make sense for St. Patrick's.  Make it festive.  Right.  Oh, Jimmy's playing with an egg.  And look who's here, Laszlo.  All right.  So what do you guys want to do?  You guys want to see how many eggs you could eat in a half hour for the hell of it?  Sure.  All right.  Want to just throw them in the corner?  In a half hour. 
[01:49:00]  See, this is the thing.  If it's a timed event...  We don't know what we're going to do.  We don't know if we're doing a timed event or every, like, two minutes they have to eat  an egg until someone pukes.  You like eggs, Bill?  Eggs are good.  Thank you, Bill.  No reason.  I can't understand why we're not in the top 100.  Who's on your shirt?  Is he number 65 on the list?  Michael Chiklis.  Oh.  Vic Mackey.  Vic Mackey.  Okay.  I don't watch The Shield, but I recognize the name. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  All right.  Should these guys just eat eggs in the corner while we continue our radio show?  Yes.  And why not?  Usually we do this behind the scenes in the ONA Lab, but why not just do it on the show  in the background?  Whenever I get mad at someone, I say, why don't you go lay an egg?  That's a good one, Jimmy.  Yeah, when you really want to hit below the belt.  What?  Did you eat today, either of you?  No.  No, you haven't had anything to eat?  I have any empty stomachs?  All right.  All right.  Why don't you guys start eating eggs, I guess? 
[01:50:00]  Let her rip.  Hold on.  We'll start.  It matters when we start.  That don't matter.  It's five after.  Five after.  These guys will eat for like a half hour so we can figure out this egg-eating contest,  okay?  Mm-hmm.  Ready, guys?  I got a stopwatch.  You got a pail between you?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, the puke bucket, just in case.  It's Tim, our intern from Springfield, who is very close to getting a divorce.  So this is more an exhibition than a contest?  Yeah, it's just a test.  What happened there with that egg? 
[01:50:30]  It exploded.  Hold on.  Something just happened.  Let me see that egg.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Is that a raw egg?  They were hard-boiled.  Okay.  How can they be hard-boiled and then go soft?  They un...  Oh, no.  It's hard-boiled.  But what happened to that one?  These aren't hard-boiled eggs.  Oh, my God.  They're not hard.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus Christ.  You fucked up the eggs.  They are all soft-boiled.  Oh, look at that one. 
[01:51:00]  It's all goopy.  Come on.  They're not even...  Oh.  What the hell?  Do you...  Do you...  Do you know...  We can't even boil eggs right.  Look at that one.  It's the easiest...  It's completely raw.  It's the easiest thing to fucking do in this world.  Oh, that is...  Who's job was this?  Oh, it just went all over.  Tim took it upon himself.  Tim, how long did you boil the eggs for?  Tim, Tim, Tim, how long?  Five minutes.  Five minutes.  You have to turn the heat on. 
[01:51:30]  They were on.  She just left them in cold water.  I think seven minutes.  Why are you...  Don't eat that!  No.  Why is the other intern eating the raw egg that traveled from Springfield?  That's a soft-boiled egg, which sometimes is good, but they have to be warm and a lot  of salt on it.  You cannot...  What?  Sir, I think seven minutes is a hard-boiled egg.  Yeah.  I think there's a three-minute soft-boiled egg and then a five-minute soft-boiled egg,  but not...  Oh, I got a couple. 
[01:52:00]  There you go.  Thanks, Ope.  There you go, Jim.  There you go.  Thanks a million, Ope.  You guys might want to move out of the way.  Thanks, Ope.  Tim, you got, like, good luck getting to the door.  Go ahead.  Give it a try.  Go ahead.  Give it a try.  Go to the door.  Get to the door.  Go to the door.  This is your punishment.  Five, four, three, two, one.  Oh, shit. 
[01:52:30]  Come on.  Let me out.  Let him out.  Don't let him out.  Don't let him out.  Don't let him out.  Don't let him out.  Just don't...  No, no.  No, not my name.  No.  I'm too much.  Tim.  Over there.  Let him out.  Let him out.  Let him out.  Let him out.  Let him out.  All right.  Let him out.  Oh, shit. 
[01:53:00]  Ah, look at the fucking window.  Now clean it up.  Bring an egg boiler like your father.  Wow.  That window looks like my boxers after Mila left.  Did we break that window?  No.  Oh, they're eggs.  No, but I don't know if that one was hard-boiled.  It smells like fucking eggs in here.  That was there.  Holy shit.  That is really fun, egging somebody.  All ganging up.  I was afraid to throw it at his head, though, because I might have had a hard-boiled one 
[01:53:30]  that hurt him.  So?  I think we hurt his feelings, too, on top of it.  Yeah, I know.  Wow.  That was fun.  That was fun.  All right.  Now my chair's got eggs on it.  Oh, did your chair get eggy?  I stand corrected.  Laszlo's chair has eggs on it.  It smells like Easter in here.  All right.  Back to the drawing board.  That's why we do the experiments before we take it out in public.  That was a failure.  Yeah, we got to boil the eggs longer. 
[01:54:00]  But it was fun.  All right, Tim.  You all right, Tim?  Did you get hurt?  You got any bruises?  I hit him hard.  And then he's got to clean up.  Dude, you wound up.  You were waving off signs.  I was like, Roger Clemens throwing at his own son.  At his kid.  What a prick.  You haven't heard yet?  It's on the front page of Newsday.  No, what happened?  Newsday today.  This is the greatest story, man.  If you ever wondered if Roger Clemens is a prick, because you hear the stories from time 
[01:54:30]  to time.  Roger Clemens, he's not really sure if he's going to be pitching this year, right?  He's going to do the World Baseball Tournament or whatever.  And then he's going to decide, I guess.  So, you know, they're starting spring training, and Roger Clemens decided to pitch to the  minor leaguers.  And his son, what's his son's name?  Kobe.  His son's name is Kobe, and he's in the Astros farm system.  He's a third baseman, right?  And I guess he's got skills.  He was the first one up as Clemens is pitching to these minor leaguers.  And Kobe takes his father's first pitch and knocks it out of the park. 
[01:55:00]  Home run.  So the next time Kobe got up, Roger throws it basically at his head.  He goes to take his head off.  What a prick.  And the front page of Newsday today, Clemens versus son, no kid gloves.  Roger nearly beans his boy after he hits dad's first pitch for home run.  It's like the great Santini.  Right.  Yeah.  Fucking prick.  Come on, sports fans.  You're going to squirt?  So.  That made the cover, though, of Newsday? 
[01:55:30]  I was just thinking the same thing.  That's a slow Newsday.  Anything really happened?  What can I tell you, you know?  You found a body with duct tape wrapped around its face?  That happens every day.  City news, though.  That's every day.  You know that.  All right.  Here we go.  Guys, what number are we on?  Number 65.  Oh, I forgot.  Bob Edwards, number 64.  And you know what?  This is where this Michael Harrison needs a beating.  He needs to at least call our show and take his verbal beating.  Even XM has acknowledged that Bob Edwards isn't as important as Opie and Anthony. 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  We're important.  And he does a one-hour fucking show.  One hour.  One hour.  Part of the criteria is hard work or something.  I forgot the criteria.  65.  This one's going to hurt.  Big time.  Don and Mike.  Yeah.  That hurts a little bit.  Ah, Jesus.  66, Jim Gearhart.  67 is Kathy and Judy. 
[01:56:30]  Ah, Kathy and Judy.  They're big, though.  They are longtime mid-morning duo.  Know what mid-morning duo means?  10 to 2?  Yeah.  Middays.  The least important spot.  Oh.  They're midday talkers.  Oh, guys.  Long-time mid-morning duo on Heritage Chicago Signal.  68.  Mark Belling.  Experienced generalist with news background in PM Drive in Milwaukee.

Then Steve Gill came in 79th place.  Steve Gill. 
[01:58:30]  A bunch of nobodies.  Bill Cunningham.  I've been on radio my entire life.  I've never heard of half these people.  Well, if you don't know who Bill Cunningham is, I feel sorry for you.  Bill Cunningham.  He's a market legend.  More than 15 years as a leaving conservative voice in Cincinnati.  All right.  That's Bill Cunningham and that child molester face of history.  Oh, my God.  That's an awful picture.  Gene Burns is 81.  Daryl Ancarlo. 
[01:59:00]  Ancarlo.  I don't know.  And Daryl Ancarlo.  Hugh Hewitt.  Is an 83rd.  Hugh Hewitt.  Lincoln where?  Is that like a joke name?  Oh, is he black?  Yes.  Oh, Lincoln where?  Lincoln where?  It should be Lincoln Y.  Oh, wow. 
[01:59:30]  That's the goddamn joke.  Let's go to 85.  Jim Villanucci.  Hey, Paisan.  86th is Mike Trivisono.  He's the reigning king of Afternoon Drive in New Mexico?  That's not even part of America.  No, it's Mexico, right?  Yeah.  It's just newer.  He's a generalist.  They have condos there.  Dude, he's a generalist with a gift for comedy.  He has a fire for laughter. 
[02:00:00]  Can I take the gift back?  Did you keep the receipt?  Because I'd like to take that gift back.  He's, what the fuck is a generalist?  Generalist.  That's very, he's very general.  Yeah, it's very vague.  Yeah.  Hey, it's kind of sunny slash cloudy out.  Yeah.  I feel that way, but I could go the other way anytime.  I don't know.  I don't know if we should be in Iraq.  But in some cases, I think we should.  Right.  Mike Rosen is in 87th place. 
[02:00:30]  Wait, can I say Mike Trivisciano here?  I got to say in 86.  Winning generalist, another generalist.  Another generalist.  Talk host covering everything from politics to sports with focus on Cleveland PM Drive.  86.  Like 7 to 11 he's doing.  He looks like a grandma.  Jack Rice is in 88th place.  Karen Hunter is in 89th place.  I swear to God, I haven't heard of any of these people.  Well, number 90, I actually used to listen to all the time.  And if I wasn't on this show, this is where I'd probably want to go. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  Why don't you tell everyone 90th place?  I don't need to.  They all know her.  On WDUN, Martha Zoller.  Yeah.  Small market issues.  Talk host with huge national profile.  An author with frequent TV appearances.  Martha Zoller.  Z-O-L-L-E-R.  Huge national profile.  You know what?  Okay.  The guy's name who does this.  Talkers Magazine.  Michael Harrison.  He's off tomorrow, so he won't be on the air, of course. 
[02:01:30]  Maybe.  What do you mean he's off tomorrow?  Ben just sent me a thing.  Harrison is off today.  Oh, today.  We'll call in tomorrow.  He's off today.  Well, he better call in.  But maybe some of our fans' pests know Michael Harrison  and would be able to give him some serious emails or calls  just in a very friendly fashion to inquire and learn for us.  Maybe some of you, we have a big fan base, know who this guy is.  Michael Harrison, Talkers Magazine.  Oh, our haters are just loving this.  No, but they know, dudes.  They know. 
[02:02:00]  They're loving this.  I got to say.  Oh, just keep on laughing and laughing.  I got to say, we sure did fuck this place up.  Yeah.  It's really hard to get that egg off of there, isn't it?  Yeah.  Hawk is trying his best.  It doesn't matter, though.  They're taking that wall down in the next few weeks.  Hawk actually asked for some mayo, and he's making egg salad on the wall  and licking it off.  It's the only way it can come off.  All right.  So Martha Zoller, Zoller, whatever.  91st place, Jeff Katz. 
[02:02:30]  He's hardworking.  Intense conservative issues host bring in fast-paced talk to midday.  One of these conservative talk show hosts.  Mike McConnell?  Mike McConnell.  This guy's fucking mid-morning star at a huge Cincinnati signal.  These guys are all midday talkers.  He's doing a midday show in Cincinnati.  And he beat us out.  And he beat us out.  Chip Franklin.  Chip Franklin.  Now, do you know this guy, Jimmy?  I know the name.  He's a veteran stand-up comic and award-winning writer  getting good ratings in mid-morning.  Another mid-morning guy. 
[02:03:00]  Chip Franklin's name, I know.  Anytime your first name is Chip, I think,  and you're a comedian, you're probably really funny.  Mid-mornings, we've discussed this in the past.  The name is funny.  Chip, that's right.  Mid-mornings is the spot they give to the least talented on the radio station.  Oh, jeez.  There's the old block.  I fell off it.  No, and then people bring up the Ron and Fez thing.  No, that's different.  It's satellite.  It's completely different.  Trust me.  They replay the show.  First of all, they're doing morning drive for the West Coast,  plus there's bigger things planned for Ron and Fez, 
[02:03:30]  because, you know, it's not a shot at Ron and Fez.  Trust me.  It's not going to affect my money, will it, Ope?  No.  Mark Bernier.  Bernier.  Bernier.  Shit, he does Florida issues.  Wow.  Issues talk staple, Ope, profile A-list interviewer,  and this is what got him on this list,  also heard in Tennessee.  Oh, okay, so he's not just Florida.  This guy's also heard in Tennessee.  Mark, it's $277 and $458. 
[02:04:00]  John DiPietro in 95th place from WRKO.  I don't have the 95 through 100.  Yeah, well.  And it really doesn't matter, does it?  It certainly does, because you're missing one of my personal favorites.  96 is Bruce Williams.  Lifestyle.  He looks like a kid toucher.  Yeah, he does.  They all do.  Financial, small business, and general life advice from this legendary broadcaster.  He looks like William Holden.  He looks like he smashes that on a coffee table. 
[02:04:30]  96, fucking drunk.  Dropped that already.  97 is Denison Callahan from WEEI in Boston doing a little sports thing.  Dan York, 98th place.  Fat face.  99 is Alan Stock and Heidi Harris.  I thought it was Alan Sniffen for a second.  I was really going to shit.  They're out of Las Vegas.  And finally, number 100.  Here it is.  100.  Who beat us out?  Oh, she's good.  Raleigh James. 
[02:05:00]  Raleigh James, yeah.  A one-of-a-kind legendary generalist syndicated late nights with a devoutly loyal following.  Right.  That's how I would describe her.  Him?  Her?  What is it?  Yeah.  No idea.  This list stinks.  Thank you, Talkers Magazine.  Thank you, Michael Harrison.  Doing a great job with your list.  Not even in the top 100.  I hope he comes on and is honest about why.  He won't be honest about why. 
[02:05:30]  He'll say, well, you know, it's the, ah.  He'll come up with some bullshit thing.  If he came on and said, look, you're hated in radio because of the things you've done by attacking other shows, and this was a way we wanted to smack you back.  At least it would be honest.  I'll respect him.  He won't.  At least it would be honest.  He won't.  I think it's perfect that we didn't make the list.  Well, honestly, it's better not to be honest than to be 83rd.  Huh?  It's better to not be honest.  It's very obvious why.  Yeah, if you're not on the list and there's something going on, obviously.  Of course.  Yeah, if we were like 82, that would be even more embarrassing.  But he's just being a little, you know, whatever. 
[02:06:00]  Let's wait until he comes on.  He won't come on, but let's see.  If they really wanted, like, you know, get under our skin, they would have made us 100.  Why is he off today?  It's a Tuesday.  You know, he likes to do research.  He's the type of guy he's going to now do research for 24 hours before he makes an appearance on our show.  All right.  I'm clearing the phone lines here.  Oh, look at you.  See?  Look at you.  You're like me with the banning.  That's right.  The power you wield like that.  Hold on. 
[02:06:30]  We've got a talk show host who wants to know where he is on the list.  Uh, yes, Greaseman.  Waddle doodle.  Where am I in the heavy 100?  Punch it out there.  Did he make the, um, the 250?  No, he did not make the 250.  Didn't even make the 250.  Waddle doodle.  Bone dry.  I stink.  I wonder what Alan Sniffen is saying about this.  If anyone on the New York radio message board is being honest with you.  I told you.  Oh, I'm sure they're just, uh, they're just laughing.  I told you. 
[02:07:00]  You know.  That's all right.  We have haters out there, and they love this type of thing.  I really don't mind that they, uh, that they get a good chuckle.  Because in the end, it just seems somehow, I don't know how, what, whatever, uh, it always  seems that there's this golden little lining.  Ooh.  The golden parachute, whatever you want to call it.  Something always seems to happen that, uh, makes us able to turn around and go, in a  very mature way.  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  Well, I was thinking more.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  You could do the nah, nah, nah, nah, nah song.  Or har, har.  Hardy.  Har.  Har.  Always win in the end.  Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Remember that statement.  Thank you.  Attention you, maggot.  I didn't give you permission for a bathroom break.  It's Father's Day.  Who's your daddy?  Any clue, maggot?  Take your loose change from that jar and bring it to the coin exchange and buy something  nice, but daddy.  I want you to get your big fat butt off the couch. 
[02:08:00]  Gather up all the change in your house.  You take it to the coin exchange.  The coin exchange is the fastest machine out there.  It's ten times faster than any other machines.  It's coins in cash out.  I love you, dad.  That's the grease man.  That is the grease man.  I saw that commercial.  That's the grease man doing commercials as a drill sergeant.  I nearly fell down.  My legs pretty much gave out on me when I saw that.  He's, as a drill sergeant, talking about those change machines where you dump your change  in in order to cash it in for cash. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yikesy.  Ugh.  That's sad.  Valentine's Day's coming.  You want a kiss from that sweet miss?  You gotta buy her something.  And you've got the change lying around the house to do it.  I want you to get your big fat butt off the couch.  Gather up all your change and move it to the coin exchange.  The coin exchange is the fastest machine out there.  It's ten times faster than any other machine.  Make the move to the coin exchange.  Today, get your loose coins to the coin exchange. 
[02:09:00]  It's coins in cash out smooching time.  Get to the coin exchange.  Jogging time.  I have so much change that I can't even fit it in the bag in my car, so I drag it behind  my truck.  Oh, oops.  Well, look out.  What a doodle.  I spent many years digging change out of my couch cushions because I was fired.  Persona non grata.  In the radio world, bone dry. 
[02:09:30]  My wallet was bone dry.  What an ass.  Dude, it would be more dignified if he just sold his children into prostitution.  Hello, it's your friend, the Grishman, and if there's one person that knows about plucking  chains out of your pants pockets and your couch cushions, it's me, the Grishman.  So go down to, what was it called?  Coin exchange.  Coin exchange.  And exchange your dignity for a few coins, like I did. 
[02:10:00]  Me, the Grishman.  What an ass.  Oh, poor bastard.  He was one of the guys that went on TV and said that we would never be back on TV.  Well, I don't think they'll ever work again.  I made my little error, but they were, I was, it was a joke.  Most people knew that, and I was able to get to work again.  These guys are pretty much done.  And go down to the coin exchange. 
[02:10:30]  Oh.  That paycheck.  How did he cash it?  Coin exchange.  I've exchanged every bit of dignity I've had.  150 bucks.  What do you think he made for that?  What could they possibly pay the Grishman to yell like an idiot?  A couple thousand, fifteen hundred, two thousand, maybe.  Not even.  Do you think?  I don't know.  It was a local commercial?  I'm thinking 800 bucks.  Is it local?  Yeah, it's gotta be.  Speaking of coins, I brought a waiter home last night, and he gave me a hell of a deposit into my slot. 
[02:11:00]  Oh!  Samantha.  Who, wait, who, who just did that commercial?  Water doodle.  Who?  I know the name.  Yeah, um.  What's his name?  What?  The guy who just did that commercial.  What?  The, the, uh, coin commercial.  Grishman.  Speaking of Grishman, I was getting fucked in the ass, and I said, do you have any Grishman?  I sure did pick up on where you were going. 
[02:11:30]  Don't take my only bit.  No, I do.  My only bit.  But I do impersonations.  All right, here we go.  Listen to this commercial.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight, yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous. 
[02:12:00]  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  I love the AIDS.  Puddle and broth not included.  How amazing is that?  That is an actual commercial from 19, what, 82?  82, 81.  A-Y-D-S.  Get into your robe and enjoy AIDS.  Yeah, it was A-Y-D-S.  My mother and I had the AIDS for a while.  Did she do?  Yeah, she would keep it in the fridge.  And every so often, we would eat the AIDS. 
[02:12:30]  Because it was chocolate.  It was like a dietary appetite suppressant, but it was chocolate.  And as a kid, that's all we gave a shit about, was that it was chocolate.  And mom used to be mad all the time that we were taking her AIDS.  Leave my AIDS alone.  That's right.  Don't, what are you doing?  Stop giving the AIDS to other people.  Don't give them AIDS.  I need the AIDS.  I need to lose weight.  Want to hear that again?  Please. 
[02:13:00]  I was overweight and embarrassed to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question, why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed. 
[02:13:30]  Fucking doctors, man.  Must have really had it out for that company.  Yeah.  Let's call this disease AIDS.  They pretty much, it pretty much put an end to that product.  Of course it did.  Good thing they didn't call it Twix.  Man, fucking gay guys giving each other Twix.  Oh, come on.  I love the Twix.  Sorry you have Coca-Cola.  What the fuck?  You're ruining our company.  Well, you get the Pepsi.  He's got the Pepsi.  AIDS.  The AIDS diet plan.  Isn't that wonderful? 
[02:14:00]  It sounds like a Steve-type voiceover to you.  You know, the perfectly spoken out.  Lose weight with AIDS.  Hey, everybody.  It's time to sing.  Everyone has AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Same age, same age, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  And so this is the end of our story.  And everyone is dead from AIDS.  It took from me, my best friend, my only true pal, my only bright star. 
[02:14:30]  He's got AIDS.  Well, I'm going to march on Washington.  Lead the fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us.  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS. 
[02:15:00]  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar, right, Ramon?  The rich texture, the full flavor, so relaxing.

[02:20:30]  A lot of fun.  Saw her on Fox when we were taking a break before.  I went into the office and saw her on Fox.  And I'm sorry.  Just didn't seem like she was having as good a time as she had in our studio, Opie.  I have a bald spot there, and I don't.  And there's Jimmy sniffing her seed when she left.  See, that's actually Jimmy sniffing this.  What?  I'm just a good guy.  And that is not...  All right, the cleaning products are fucking me up now. 
[02:21:00]  Exactly.  I just breathed in, and it felt like I breathed in sand.  You should be used to that smell.  No, I'm not.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, that's really bad.  Keep that door open.  Get the fuck out.  Like you're not staying up all night with cleaning supplies.  He spends eight hours just trying to clean what turned out to be a scratch.  I won't come on.  The moonlight is coming through the windows. 
[02:21:30]  It's four in the morning.  Gotta be clean.  And there he is on his hands and knees in his boxers.  It has to be clean.  It has to be clean.  Third Reich fucking boxers.  Third Reich boxers and the long overcoat button to the neck.  And in one hand, he's cleaning.  In the other hand, he's holding a Fisher-Price phone with the cord hanging, but it's not plugged  into anything.  And she's like, what's the matter?  And he goes, it's Rommel.  Plugged into nothing. 
[02:22:00]  It's a little yellow phone.  I do not.  Can you please help me?  Please help me.  Help me.  Could you please help me?  That's my favorite thing on this show.  That shit is the worst.  Oh, it's really strong.  I don't know what they use.  Laszlo in studio.  But first, Andrew.  Laszlo, also known as 102 on the list.  Andrew.  Right.  Laszlo didn't make the list.  No.  Yeah, Kim Commando was on there.  What the hell's that?  She does that computer talk show.  She was like number 10 or 11. 
[02:22:30]  You guys were talking about that yesterday.  Is that your competition?  Sort of.  Is she good?  No.  She's at none of the tech conventions.  You never, ever see her.  You're always there doing your research.  Yeah.  Knowing what's going on.  Hold on one sec.  We're going to just go to Andrew in Brooklyn before we get into the tech talk.  Andrew.  Hey, I just wanted to point out the theory that famous people always die in groups of three.  Oh, yeah.  I guess Don Knotts died and that other guy from The Christmas Story.  That other guy?  That guy was pretty famous. 
[02:23:00]  He was the father in The Christmas Story and his name is...  He was Kolchek, the Night Stalker.  That's right.  He was a dad.  Darren McGavin.  Thank you, Anthony.  Darren McGavin.  Yes.  And then McCloud.  McCloud died.  What the hell was his name?  Darren McGavin?  No.  Tim Weaver.  No.  Tim Weaver.  Something with Dennis Weaver.  Dennis Weaver.  Dennis Weaver.  Dream...  Oh.  Who was it?  Dream Weaver.  I'm Tim Weaver.  Dennis Weaver, who was McCloud on the ABC mystery movie. 
[02:23:30]  He was also in Gunsmoke.  He was in Gunsmoke.  1956, Anthony.  And he was also in Steven Spielberg's real first directorial debut movie.  Yeah, Duel.  Duel.  Where he ran from the big tractor-trailer truck.  He was trying to...  That was great.  Driving for no reason.  This tractor-trailer was trying to run him over.  Huh.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Doug Pops is fat faggot.  What?  What?  Someone's a faggot.  Someone's a fat faggot. 
[02:24:00]  Who could that be?  I don't know.  One other thing before we get into some tech talk.  Rusty.  Because I know we'll go off on a dumb tangent and we'll never get to this.  The transgender teacher.  Yes.  It's a slow news day, but man, is this a great story.  It's a teacher.  She, he, it.  70, 71 and decides...  What?  Time to become a woman.  71?  71.  It's time to be a lady.  Look, to the people out there that are thinking of doing this, don't wait till you're 71. 
[02:24:30]  Do it at 18.  When everything is sagging.  Do it when you're young.  Young.  Where you can feel up your own boobs nicely.  Cutting your dick off is a thing for the young.  That's right.  Get an operation, fall over and break your hip.  Yeah.  She's, he, it.  I never know what to call him.  What do you call it?  Wrong.  It's a guy.  Wrong.  At 71, the guy's a teacher or something and decides, uh, he wants to, uh, become a woman  and then go back to teaching.  Speaking of teaching, I had a young student over at my place last night and he got a passing 
[02:25:00]  grade.  Oh, saucy.  That's what's horrifying.  Awful.  Where's a picture of this creature?  Yeah, where is a picture?  I don't know.  Did it make a picture?  There was a picture.  I saw a picture.  Awful.  As bad as you think.  As bad as you think.  Old men do start looking like old ladies after a while, but, you know.  And the old ladies start, uh, looking manly. 
[02:25:30]  Looking like men.  Where's that picture, Ben?  Where's that picture of Dolby's Daily News?  Oh, sweet.  All right, let's see.  What a big tranny head this thing has.  What page?  I'm in my workbook.  Page 16, doll face.  That's a good...  What?  God, that fucking cleaning stuff.  Which page?  God damn it.  16.  Lily Macbeth, 71, at home in Little Egg Harbor, Township, New Jersey, is ready for substitute 
[02:26:00]  teaching after undergoing sex change.  Eagleswood Township Board of Education decided yesterday she could resume work.  They had no choice.  They had to allow her back to work to horrify the kids.  But as a substitute teacher, because substitute teachers get a beat down.  Oh!  I got cock all these years.  It was substitute genitals.  Wait.  And now the real ones show up.  Wait, what was this?  A guy?  It was a guy.  You sure?  And it's still William Frawley in a wig.  Definitely.  I don't know what this thing is.  Nice bangs. 
[02:26:30]  Hey, Rick, you want to squeeze my tits?  Oh, my God.  That is, yeah, a grown man in a wig.  You know who?  Jesus Christ.  Who?  It's Rumsfeld.  That's Donald Rumsfeld in a wig.  It's sort of a cross between Rumsfeld and Cheney.  Jesus, yes.  Both of them.  It's Rumsfeld, Cheney in a wig.  With tits.  And then he paints the fingernails so it looks like that's going to lady him up a little bit. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  They doll themselves up.  Sitting with the legs crossed, just trying to be dainty at 71 and fat.  Trying to be a dainty young lass.  Let's hear how to Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I want to tell Anthony, if you're going to be coughing, could you press the cough button?  Exactly.  We're professional boygots.  Thank you very much, sir.  Good point.  Good point.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, guys.  We need to do everything right to make next year's top 100 list. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  I want to be 98.  It's probably the coughing that made us not make that list.  Let's go to Tim in Jersey.  Tim.  Yo, O&A.  Hey.  Let me tell you about this freak show.  Holy shit.  I was at that thing last night they had.  Man, she's just, I don't know what the hell was going on with it.  What day?  They had another tranny there sticking up for her.  He was just his worst.  Yeah, a lot of the people don't want this guy teaching anymore.  What kind of thing were you at?  A rally?  Yeah, exactly.  Dang.  Well, let's go to the news story here.  Normally, the hiring of a substitute teacher attracts little or no attention, but that is 
[02:28:00]  not the case tonight in Eagleswood Township, Ocean County.  Ocean County.  Four.  71-year-old Lily Macbeth has been hired as a substitute teacher in the K-6 Eagleswood Elementary  School District.  Macbeth has subbed in the past, but that was before changing her gender.  She was then William Macbeth.  I have nothing to fear.  Perhaps Macbeth's hiring. 
[02:28:30]  Wait, who was that?  That's Billy Macbeth.  Billy and how Lily?  I have nothing to fear.  Is that the principal or is that the teacher?  No, that sounds like the teacher, I think.  I think that was the teacher.  Are you kidding?  We need more teacher audio.  Lily Macbeth, formerly Jack Gordon.  Oh, we're here.  We're here.  I'd fuck me.  Would you fuck me?  Would you give me a passing grade?  I'd teach me.  Was then William Macbeth.  I have nothing to fear. 
[02:29:00]  Perhaps Macbeth's hiring might not have caused controversy, but for a full-page ad that appeared  in a local paper, paid for by Mark Schnapp, who has two children in Eagleswood, the ad urges  people to attend tonight's school board meeting, saying, quote, you won't believe it.  Schnapp did not return our calls, but has reportedly said that he has problems with  Macbeth's hiring on religious grounds.  Freedom of speech.  Man can run an ad like that any time he wants.  Any person can. 
[02:29:30]  If you want to incite the public, that's a good way to do it.  Macbeth has had a background check done, as required by law, and will meet privately  with the board tonight.  She says to confirm her gender and to make sure she dresses appropriately.  When asked if her appearance and husky voice might confuse children and spark questions,  Macbeth says...  When children ask a personal question in a class, I simply make a statement to them, I  do not discuss those things in class.  I don't have a penis. 
[02:30:00]  Okay?  It's inappropriate.  I asked some parents what they think.  Won't confuse the kids.  To each his own.  But I don't know, you know, I don't know how you can explain that to, you know, second,  third, fourth, and fifth graders.  You can't.  The great town is a small community, and, you know, nobody's really to judge.  They didn't hurt anybody.  Now, it's important to note that the Board of Education cannot deny employment as a substitute  teacher to Macbeth based on the gender change.  That would be discrimination. 
[02:30:30]  However, it is very likely that there will be plenty of opinions voiced tonight on both  sides of the transgender hiring issue.  Holy crap.  Could we send one of our guys there?  Please.  There's a transgender hiring issue.  Does anyone live close to there?  Yeah, I want to hear that.  And they said as long as she dresses appropriately, which means that she should walk into class  with a stool under her feet and a rope around her neck.  I want to say objected on biblical grounds, because Leviticus is very clear about transgender  issues.  Right.  That's right. 
[02:31:00]  Forgive her father, for she knows not what she cuts off.  Stupid.  Mark Schnapp.  Schnapp.  The Schnapp family doesn't approve.  The Schnapp family, very upset.  It is 71.  Just, you know what?  Just retire.  Stop it.  Just go away.  Please.  That's 71.  I don't discuss my personal life.  Writing the double A-R-P.  I've changed my gender.  Please update my card.  Liz.  Hi.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Liz.  How do you see how to pick one of those old names, like Lily or Gertrude or... 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, why?  Lily.  Because you're finally going to become a woman and you make your name Lily.  71.  Portia.  Amber.  Yeah, Portia.  Of course you're saying, Portia.  Can you imagine that mess walks in?  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  I'm Portia.  Portia McBeth.  Why do you have a high voice?  I cut my cock off, kid.  Oh, shit.  I'm not supposed to say that.  That's private.  Zero to sixty in five seconds.  And I was seventy-one, so this duffel bag I'm holding used to be my sack. 
[02:32:00]  Why don't I just go all the way and name yourself Lady McBeth?  Lady McBeth.  No, some kind of sexy hot name.  I'm Tiffany.  Hi.  Hi, Miss Lexus.  There must just be...  I can picture a lot of chatter in the teacher lounge, too.  A lot of chatter, and then he walks in, and it just gets dead quiet.  And you can only kind of make out things.  Brr, brr, brr, faggot.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, fucking freak.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, not my kids.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, confusing. 
[02:32:30]  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  I don't know, I'll see that.  You know, Jim makes a good point in Jersey here.  Jim?  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Two things.  First of all, this is fucking bullshit.  This bitch gets rehired, or this thing better, gets rehired, and fucking sidecar Kenny is  suspended.  What a fucking load of shit.  And number two, at least you didn't change her name to Wilhelmina.  Wilhelmina.  Well, Lily and Wilhelmina, same thing to me.  Gertrude, Gertie, Mildred, Millie. 
[02:33:00]  I want to talk to this thing's grandchildren who have to say, you are a faggot from your  grandson, Frank.  Thanks for humiliating me, Grandpa.  And he's in the bed with his fucking cock with a bandage on him.  Oh, he's grandma now.  Okay, we're going to see.  Remember Grandpa, Grandpa Bill?  Yeah.  Yeah, because kids are so understanding.  Yeah, and you got to talk to him like this.  Well, we're going to go see him now.  You know he was in the hospital for a little while, having an operation? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Well, we're going to see him now.  But Grandpa Bill is now Grandma Lily.  Oh.  What?  How?  Why did that?  Well, he's a faggot and like sucking cock.  How do you explain to children?  And kids, you know, they just let it all out.  Oh, all of it.  They'll tell you when you have bad breath.  Oh, you stink.  Right.  Your breath stinks.  Well, how about the other kids? 
[02:34:00]  What is that?  The friends of the kids.  You know, that trumps any argument.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Your grandfather had his cock cut off, and he now wears a dress.  Yeah.  Case closed.  You win.  All right.  Whatever I was saying pales in comparison.  Trumped.  McFly the trucker.  Hey, I got a new job for David Lee Robb, man.  He can make a new video going hot for teacher in this fucking monstrosity walk.  I wasn't liking his goof at first.  I like it a lot.  And it was funny.  All right.  There's another transgender story in the news today before we move on to Laszlo. 
[02:34:30]  You almost made it sound like Laszlo's a transgender story in the news also.  I said before we move on to Laszlo, Grand Central Tranny Cops Harassing Me is the headline  from the New York Post today.  A transgender woman who repairs payphones at Grand Central Station claims MTA cops have  harassed her, called her freak and weirdo, and arrested her three times once when she  was in the ladies' room. 
[02:35:00]  How many payphones are left?  There's like two.  You can't even find a payphone anymore.  How many of them need to be repaired?  And why does it have to be done by someone who fucking has a cock and wears a dress?  Can't you find a guy to do that?  Ready for this?  All the years of putting a finger in that slot.  Just going, God, I wish that was me.  Lousy cock.  Oh, God.  Cumbersome appendage.  Late at night, just looking at it.  Boo! 
[02:35:30]  Boo!  Boo!  Helena Stone, who was named Henry McGinnis at birth 70 years ago, has filed harassment  complaints with the MTA's Inspector General's Office and the City Human Rights Commission  in a bid to end the taunts and arrest for disorderly conduct.  I'd like to go to work in peace.  I don't go looking for an argument, said Stone.  She said the nasty name calling started in August after she was assigned to Grand Central. 
[02:36:00]  The first arrest on September 29th was made after she took an escalator from her tiny  office on the track level to the concourse.  She got no explanation.  She was handcuffed and taken to jail, said her lawyer, Michael Silverman.  70 years old.  What's up with all these old people?  Old people deciding they want this.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Whatever happened to just fucking knitting a doily?  Can't you knit a doily?  Can't you just be a gay guy in your house or dress like a woman? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, act like a woman.  Just be a typical gay grandfather.  Just make people uncomfortable when you're alone with the children.  They don't want to acknowledge anything, but you sit them on your lap a little too long  and then you're like, oh, my back hurts.  I can't stand up.  And we all know why you can't stand up.  Can't it just be like the good old days where you'd quietly hurt them?  No.  Now you got to go through surgery at 71.  Like, that isn't risky enough for old codgers to be under the knife.  They're cutting their dick and balls off.  I don't know.  71. 
[02:37:00]  Doctor has to blow the dust off the cock before they slice it.  That's healing quite nicely.  You have to use one of those air blowers that you buy to fucking clean your computer keyboard.  You have to kill the skin back.  There's a spider web in it.  Big thatch of gray pubes.  Let's say hi to Tom in Jersey.  Tom?  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Hi, Tom.  I have a teacher.  Sorry about a teacher I had in high school who had a sex change operation. 
[02:37:30]  Really?  Yeah, she was a woman and she was huge.  And I always accused her of being a man.  And she denied it.  But one day I was over at a friend's house and somehow we were talking about the teacher.  And it turns out my friend's father had known the person and confirmed that they had a sex operation  and told me the name before she had the operation.  But one day after class, I was failing the class miserably.  I went up to her and I just said,  Hey, does this name mean anything to you? 
[02:38:00]  And I never saw somebody's face go pale so fast.  Then what happened?  I wound up passing the class with a really good grade.  Could have probably gotten laid, too.  I don't think that's the kind of lay I want.  Great story.  What happened after that?  How did the next year go for you?  You passed?  Well, I didn't have her again, but she would never look at me again.  Sir, I always had problems in class.  Did you find that your schooling suffered because of this? 
[02:38:30]  No.  Shut up.  I used it to my advantage.  I didn't tell anyone.  Shut up.  Shut up.  No, it worked out for me.  Shut up.  Shut up.  How old are you now?  And how many years ago was this?  Kind of what happened to this person?  Well, I'm 30.  I don't know.  I actually think you'd give a shit about anything more you're saying.  No, go.  What were you saying?  She still keeps me out.  No, he won't even fucking hang up.  Wow.  Well, why didn't you go to the Board of Education or do something like that?  Someone shut up.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  He's answering the fucking question.  Shut up.  Stupid asshole. 
[02:39:00]  So, well, you don't know what's going to happen when you do something like that.  I mean, how old exactly were you?  I was about seven.  He's answering every question.  We give a shit.  Oh, okay.  So, this person is still teaching, like, school.  Now, do you have kids on your own?  No, I don't.  Oh, I hope this is.  Kill your son.  Come on.  What were you saying?  Come on, dude.  Finish the story.  I don't have any kids on my own right now.  I don't care.  Finish the story.  Oh, I hope you fucking do it.  So, you graduated, right?  And then you went to college? 
[02:39:30]  Yep.  Where'd you go?  What'd you take?  Well, I went for a computer program.  Did we even give a flying fuck?  What were you saying, dude?  I went for computer programming.  Oh, computer programming.  Fortran or COBOL?  I'm only a crushing boy, sir.  Enough.  No one cares.  What did you say?  I just don't care.  Shut your mouth.  Do you know him at every party he's at?  Do you know Java programming?  Uh, not really.  I'd rather eat Lily Macbeth's ass than listen to you.  Have you ever, uh, I mean, because, uh, I know HTML's really changed a lot. 
[02:40:00]  Have you figured out any HTML programming?  How do you make a tranny story boring, you doll?  Why don't you just hang up?  Have some dignity.  Are you still?  I can't believe I worked Fortran into a conversation today.  Yes, you did.  Thank you.  Fortran.  Who else could do that except Laszlo?  Laszlo yanking out C-prompt chatter.  Well, Laszlo's in studio here. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  And I got a cheat sheet.  I do, too.  He makes it very easy for us.  How about that?  Yeah, some of this stuff is, uh, really...  What Laszlo gets a lot of information on is the sneaky little things going on in the world of electronics.  Things that, um, you know, you do on a daily basis, and then all of a sudden you don't realize they're throwing in these little gizmos, gadgets, and doodads, if I may say, uh, and, uh, tracking what you're doing.  This one, MP3 watermarking. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, they're working on, uh, a system.  Um, in fact, the same people that invented the MP3, the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany, are working on a system to embed data when you buy a song online.  Everyone's doing that.  That'll say, you know, this was purchased by Jim Norton.  So, Jim...  So, on the file, right now you buy a file.  Right.  You buy an MP3.  Uh, you listen to it.  There's no info on that MP3 that would let anyone know you bought it. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  They're going to put something on there that, uh, will identify the buyer of that file.  That's what they're working towards.  And then, uh, give the example that you gave me earlier.  So, Jimmy says, I'm going to make a, uh, a nice little mix CD for Patrice O'Neal.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  So, he burns a CD from songs he's downloaded from iTunes.  Mm-hmm.  Gives it to Patrice.  Patrice rips it to MP3, puts it up on a file sharing site.  The record company comes along and sees, uh, the first song on the CD, which would be... 
[02:42:00]  Um, something, uh, Walk Like an Egyptian.  Okay.  All right.  And, uh, they see Walk Like an Egyptian.  They have software.  They can look for the digital watermark on there.  And they see that it was originally purchased by...  James Norton.  Right.  With, uh, any info they need to track you down.  And then...  Knock, knock, knock.  Hey, Jimmy.  How you doing?  But I also...  I found a file with a name on it. 
[02:42:30]  It's your name.  They could also probably tell who uploaded it, though.  And I'm sure there's a different...  You have to probably...  I think when you buy that file, uh, you, you have to...  You know when you hit, I agree, and don't read any of that shit?  Who reads that stuff?  I think in that shit is something saying you are not to do certain things with it.  Well, how about this?  Uh, I actually...  I actually...  This is actually not a new story.  Laszlo has it new, but I've heard actually how they do this.  Oh, thank you.  Um...  Fill us in, please.  No, I have.  Do you have a Walk Like an Egyptian?  Uh-huh.  Of course.  Hawk, I'd get it quick if I were you with a marker. 
[02:43:00]  You're going to be flying right at your teeth.  We do have more eggs left.  Five, four, three, two, one.  Oh, no.  Oh, look.  He's catching the eggs with his mouth.  He did that really quick.  It's two for Tuesday.  Yeah.  Yes.  We're going to start it off with the Bengals on your hub of rock and roll.  A 50,000-watt play-free.  Oh, you hit them.  Oh, this is how it won't be.  During the song at one point. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, hey, yo.  Jim Norton bought this song.  This was bought by Jim Norton on August 5th.  Norton bought this.  Norton bought this.  Norton bought this.  Norton bought this.  Jim Norton bought this.  Jim Norton bought this.  Jim Norton bought this.  Oh, hey, yo. 
[02:44:00]  Didn't this just have an alarm on it or a siren?  What happened to that?  That'd be great.  Jim Norton bought this.  Oh, hey, yo.  Now he'll go to jail.  All the school kids, so sick of books, they're like the bunk in the middle.  That's right.  When the bus that rings, oh, hey, yo.  They're walking like an Egyptian.  All the kids in the marketplace say.  Warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning. 
[02:44:30]  Jim Norton has made an illegal transfer of this song.  Warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning.  This is where they all dance.  Yeah.  Big ol' Chassis there.  Yes, they did.  Let's say hi to Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  Yo, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Hi.  Just had a couple quick things.  I'm not quick.  Jimmy, I love you.  Anthony, you're funny as shit 
[02:45:00]  But Opie, I don't know, man  I just don't find you funny, man  You suck  Oh boy, here we go  You know, I was the one that put you on the air, by the way, Rob  Thanks for giving Whackbag  Another 8,000 posts  To post tonight  About why Opie is here  What he does, what he doesn't do  What everyone does, what this one sucks at  What this one rules at  There it goes, start the thread, gentlemen  Start the thread 
[02:45:30]  I guess after 25 years on radio  Rob is finally going to tell me  That I just shouldn't do this  There you go  It's about time someone tells me  Because I don't like myself  Rob, what do you do?  Let me ask you, what do you do for a living?  I'm a plumber  You're a plumber, okay  So you go in a house and plumb  That's right, I don't like the way you scoop shit out with your bare hands  What do you think of that, fella?  Come on, Jimmy, I love you  Do you run the company, by the way?  Do you run the company?  I'm a subcontractor 
[02:46:00]  You're a subcontractor  So you have somebody that sends you out on a job?  Pretty much  Yeah, that's what they do  They run the company?  Yes  They maybe keep things organized  So you don't just knock on people's doors and go  Do you need plumbing done here?  More or less  Uh-huh  Does that boss go out sometimes and do a little plumbing himself?  Sure  Sure, every so often  But for the most part  He's making sure that the plumbers know what they're doing 
[02:46:30]  Pretty much  Are you getting my fucking analogy, stupid?  I don't know why you call me stupid, Anthony  I like you  Because  Well, I don't like you  It's another person who doesn't understand the roles of people on this program  Sir, Divide and Conquer doesn't work on this show  There are people that have specific skills on this program  We are still trying to find E-Rocks, but I'm sure it will pop up somewhere  But everyone else has a skill 
[02:47:00]  And they all use them to the best of their abilities  And each one is needed and essential to this program  And Rob, why today?  Because I thought my Samantha impression was just terrific  On a day where he's using Samantha impressions  And Angry Typing Guy makes an appearance in the same day  And I started the egg throwing  Egg throwing  I've had a terrific show today  That was oops  All right, the goatee Hitler mustache joke  I understand your point there  Swing and a miss, it happens  Swing and a miss, who doesn't?  See, Rob  We all have our swings and misses  When I do this psychological bullshit 
[02:47:30]  I wait for the person to actually be down  And then you can hit them nice and hard  But when they're actually having a really good day  Or a really good show  It's not as effective  There are days I stink on ice  That's the day you should call  And then you might get under my skin a little bit  Can I ask one more question?  Oh, no  Uh-oh  No, nothing bad  All right, Rob  We don't care  How about no?  How about you don't get to?  Rob  Rob  Come on  Rob, Rob  Rob, it's Opie  All right  Do you like me just a little bit? 
[02:48:00]  All right, I like you a little bit  Just a little?  How long have you been listening to this show, Rob?  About a year  You know that one of my jobs is to be very obnoxious?  I know that  You know that I have a lot of haters out there?  I know you do  I mean, everyone loves Anthony  Yes, they do  Oh, my God  I am beloved  I spend a lot of nights trying to find one goddamn negative post about Anthony  And I can't find it  I do get them sometimes  You do?  I read one last night that I was too likable  And I felt bad 
[02:48:30]  I wrote the guy back  And I turned him around  You know, I was into page 37 of one of the threads  And I still couldn't find anything bad about Anthony  Page 37  All right, Rob  What's your final question?  If Sirius did offer you guys enough money, would you switch?  In a second  Sir, we are so in this for the cash  I mean, honestly  For enough money?  Who wouldn't?  What's enough money? 
[02:49:00]  I don't  We make enough money  Yeah, those guys do  We're doing fine  If Jimmy wants to go over to Sirius  However, if they offered me enough money, I might go over there  All right  Well, that's all  What are the circumstances?  Do we have any other options?  Or is it the only place left to go?  Rob?  Rob, Rob  Just wait till you see what we do next  Yeah, we're like  Thank you  We're pioneers  Thank you  By the way  I have Sirius and I have XM  We understand why this call is happening, Rob 
[02:49:30]  Don't you understand that?  Rob, by the way  This is going to get under your  Under your skin a little bit  Uh-oh  I'm a millionaire for doing bad radio  Oh, no  Thank you  Wow, how'd you get under Rob's and my skin?  Oh  Jesus  So, Rob, we understand what the call is about  We know you have Sirius, sweetie  We understand  All right  You realize the time has passed  Where you can yell the names out and be effective  Yeah  So you try to be backdoor psychology  But we kind of got it  As soon as you said, Jimmy, I love you  And I love you  We understood where it was going 
[02:50:00]  It's called a troll  You're very hurtful, Rob  He's a troll  You're very hurtful  Yeah  Why don't you just yell out the other show name  And then we'll hang up and go  Oh, not on the station, bub  And Rob  No, no, no  Since you have both  Not all about that  Rob, since you have both  You have Sirius and XM  He can skip one step in the Jim Norton trifecta  That's right  And I would say  Don't  I would say flush it down the toilet  And go fuck your mother  But then they'd have to call him to take it out  Because he's a plumber  He's a plumber  Exactly 
[02:50:30]  Hold on  Turtle wants in  Turtle  Turtle  This is Turtle from the Church of Opie  Jimmy, love you  Opie, love you  I just wanted to say  Uh-oh, I didn't hear an Anthony love you  Hold on a minute  Hold on  I didn't hear an Anthony love you  Turtle  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to leave you out  Anthony  We like you too  Oh, thank you  Okay  Likes me  That's okay  The Church of Opie was very upset with this  And we just want everyone to know  He's got his own church  That Opie has a dedicated website to his worship 
[02:51:00]  Yes  The Destroyer must not be  Yeah, I also noticed you guys have an update  It's September 22nd  Thanks for the effort, boys  Thanks for the effort  It's still working on the Old Testament, Opie  Which makes me believe that maybe I haven't added anything significant  No  That they can talk about on the Church of Opie  Not at all  You don't see new passages being tossed into the Bible, do you?  Right  It's a finished work  I go there every once in a while to the Church of Opie  Just hoping for that update 
[02:51:30]  Something new  I think it's September 22nd, the last update  Turtle, is there going to be an update?  Perhaps Opie's Samantha impression and angry typing guy can be on there?  I'm sure that there will probably be an update even as we speak  And on the seventh day, Opie created angry typing guy  Created shit radio  Thank you  Punching out, guys  All right, Turtle  Rob, I'm sorry you don't like me  What can I tell you?  I'm starting to like you a little bit  I don't even like myself, so you're on to something  Oh, boy 
[02:52:00]  I just wish both of you guys could be all on the same  Hey, you know what?  We know, Rob  Hey, Rob  Rob, and maybe this is why I get under people's skin  Because we talk openly and honestly here  That wasn't our choice, buddy  Howard didn't want us on the same station back in the day  Because he was so obsessed with the buzz we were getting with our radio show  We had nothing to do with that  Another quick thing  Why don't you guys ever, like  I know Bubba starts talking a lot of shit about you guys 
[02:52:30]  And you guys don't talk shit about him  It's more or less Howard this, Howard that  Because it's Howard, Howard's the story over there  It's not Howard and Bubba is the story over there  It's Howard Stern is the story over there  Right  I think Bubba would like to think it's Howard and Bubba  But it's just, it's Howard  The only time we talked about Bubba we had audio  He talks in a phony voice  And we made fun of him because he was like  You know, challenge you to this  It was just cornball shit  It's not worth it  He's a cornball dude  Rob, he challenged me to put the gloves on 
[02:53:00]  And step into an octagon  For charity  For charity  We don't know how to mess with that  And Howard will be taking over afternoons over there  And he's going to be pushed to midday  So that shows you how important he is to Howard  Right  And there's no, there's no, there's no, there's no buzz on Bubba  Always be honest about the agenda when you call, sweetie  Yeah  Always be honest  Always be honest about the agenda  Alright, Rob  Alright, I had a bunch of agendas, but thanks for answering  We know you did  Bye, bye  Goodbye, Angel  There he goes  Could see that coming 
[02:53:30]  Oh, dude  A mile away  I almost, I understand it  It's like when you get to a point where you know  If I yell the, if I yell, you know  Fa, fa, foo  You know it's embarrassing and no one cares  So you try that  It's like, dude  Alright  Yeah  MP3 players, watermarking  Was there anything else on that, Laszlo?  No  Jimmy will get in big trouble when they play walking  Like an Egyptian is what we learned there  I think that was a very, very good point I raised  Right  Well, what are they going to use the info for?  To go after people or? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, they're hoping to just make, you know, songs you download from iTunes  And even though iTunes isn't a proprietary format  You can still burn the songs to MP3 and then share them  I've had problems going from iTunes to anything else  To burning it, you know  Or putting it even on  If I want to, if I want to get a song to put behind a video  I can't pop it onto my video editing programs or anything  Right, because that's improper use  Improper use  Right  Yeah  Excuse me, can I go back to the phone? 
[02:54:30]  Jesus Christ  Oh, certainly  Adam in Canada  Yeah, guys, how you doing?  Hey  Hi  Yeah  I've been a long time listener  It's great to have you guys back in Canada  And over the last year, I've noticed that Jimmy, right on  Opie, holding down the fort  Thank you  Anthony, I'm not so sure that they're quite as funny as he used to be  Now we're on to something  Now we're on to something  Oh, no  Whatever happened to good old Don West? 
[02:55:00]  Don West?  Don West  Anthony's up there  Dude with the Mark McGuire rookie  Yeah, I did a little Don West back then  Yeah, that still does him  See, I grow as a performer, my friend  That's right  I grow  I moved on to other things  He's still putting out albums, sir  Seems like the only thing you're growing into, sir  Is a gaunt wop  A gaunt wop  I'm not  I've always been a gaunt wop  I'm not growing into a gaunt wop  Alright, one call that hates Jimmy 
[02:55:30]  So we can all feel good about it  I didn't like him  Oh, the phones are exploding  Let me tell you something, though  I really thought that was a goof  I don't even know if it was real  He was a fucking foreigner  He's from Canada  That's right  You tell him  All of America likes me  They do  And that's all I care about  That's right  America  You slender greaseball  I like that Anthony has brought a whole bunch of brand new things to the show  Thank you  You know  Thank you  Not resting  He's coming up with new things all the time  I try sometimes 
[02:56:00]  You know, I can't force it  I'm not going to do Don West  A lot of people forgot who Don West was  We do him every so often  We had him on the phone  I was doing the Maguire rookie card  Doing that whole thing  But Tony Danza was the new one  That came up, what, a year ago  Until he lost all relevance  Great  For 15 minutes he gave me a new impression  Thanks, Tony  Do something else  You dumb wop  You gaunt wop  The garlic  People  People  By the way  Because people are now going to hate me 
[02:56:30]  For taking that phone call  I really thought that it was a goof  And I still think it might have been a goof  I just think it was you being nasty  I think so too  I think it was you being argumentative  I think it was just a way to  Kind of come  But make yourself feel a little better  That's right  And I bet you that one  My new favorite radio show  Who's the guy and the gal  We were listening to before  Bob and Sherry  Bet you Bob and Sherry  Don't take calls like that  I hope that guy perishes  In a bizarre curling accident  Oh, Bob  Here's a caller  He says your hair looks like Bob McAllister  And you should die of the bird flu  Click  I almost said AIDS 
[02:57:00]  That's harsh  But then I didn't want to get a call  Saying another AIDS joke  Another AIDS joke from Jimmy  Alright, here we go  So I said bird flu  So the mp3 thing  Watermarking  That sucks  Uh, hold on  Hold on  I just  One second  What's up, sweet pie?  I just have to make myself feel better after that  So I'm just randomly banning somebody  There you go  Bye  Make sure they have a card  Bye  I just randomly picked somebody  And shot him in the back of the head  Absolutely  Thank you  Now  I feel good now 
[02:57:30]  I got tired of watching them run through pal talk  In that little red dress  That's what you can do when you're king  You just grab one of the serfs  Boom  Chop their head off  I understand that whole thing about power and how  Just pulling someone out of the crowd and shooting them in the head  Makes you feel a little better  And it scares the rest of them  They're giving me the name Banthony now  They call me Banthony  Banthony  I love it  I love it  My loyal subjects  Alright  Fear me  Fear me 
[02:58:00]  Then they'll fear you  Laszlo  Yeah, Anthony and I were talking earlier about how HBO is setting restrictions on what you can record on your DVR  Can you throw us one fucking bone  It's probably hurting DVD sales  Whoa  Geez  We pay how much  How much is your cable bill a month?  100 bucks  Mine's ridiculous  Mine's well over 100  It's over  It's about 130  Just basic  The second I get anything on demand  It's going up into like the 160s when I start getting some pay-per-view stuff  I think mine is up to 172 if I'm not mistaken 
[02:58:30]  172 dollars a month for cable  Isn't that ridiculous?  For cable  And perish the thought  You put something on your fucking DVR  So maybe if you enjoyed it you could watch it again  Or you weren't home  You could watch it  Or then they just don't want you burning them to a DVD  Is that it?  The new DVR is actually that they were showing at the Consumer Electronics Show  You know, have DVD burners in them  Like, oh, cool  So this way I can pull stuff off the hard drive  Yeah, that's a little blatant 
[02:59:00]  That's always the issue  Is the hard drive's full  I can't erase the entire season of ER  Right, so let me burn it  And I'll keep it for later  You know what?  And I'll throw it away promptly after I view it  What HBO is doing is they're positioning themselves here  They're not happy  And then what's going to happen  Because we all have movies on demand  Where you have to pay for, right?  Mm-hmm  This is going to go down that road  HBO on demand  You're going to have to pay a buck or two  You watch  That's what they're  You watch  That's their strategy  He's exactly right  That's bullshit  They're making so much fucking money off us already 
[02:59:30]  They want you to pay extra for on demand  For everything  Yeah, because they  I mean, Blockbuster and all that  You know, those places are going away  I rarely go to Blockbuster now  But I have no problem running movies on my cable system  You know, and sometimes you get the free movies  Because HBO on demand or whatever  It's free  Yep  But you watch  That's the next step  And HBO petitioned the FCC  With prayer  To  You can't  To petition the FCC with prayer  To prevent  I don't  To prevent people from recording stuff on their DVR 
[03:00:00]  That's on the on demand channel on HBO  So if  Basically they don't want you to get on demand  Record a bunch of stuff to your DVR  And then say, okay, I'm done with HBO on demand  I don't want to pay the monthly service  And then you've got, you know, all this stuff on your DVR to watch  They don't want you to be able to record that  And then what, re-sign up?  After a while  When you've viewed all of the on demand stuff?  You know  I think it's about DVD sales  I think that's  Oh, absolutely  It's a huge piece  They don't want you recording all the Sopranos 
[03:00:30]  Alright, you watch though  Now you're going to have to pay for all of it  I bet you it's right around the corner, man  They want you to pay twice  I knew this DVR and TiVo thing was too good to be true  Yeah  I'm whipping through shows now  It's unbelievable how much more TV I'm watching  Because I don't sit through the commercials  You can watch entire seasons  In one night  Without watching one commercial  You just zip right through them  And did you see what the ad agencies did for the Olympics?  Yeah  And it fucking worked  I hate it  Pissed me off  What did they do?  It was two commercials  One is, I think, Coca-Cola 
[03:01:00]  One is Kentucky Fried Chicken  And they do this thing where they show their secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken  And they show Coca-Cola's secret formula for a split second  It's like, and here's our secret formula  Boom, boom, boom, and it's gone  And just out of curiosity  I was like, what the fuck was that?  And then slow-moing  Looking, freeze frame  And then looking at all the little things  Now, I didn't watch the entire commercial  But it made me stop 
[03:01:30]  Recognize what the commercial was for  And I spent some time with it  You know, going through their little diagram that they drew up  They also had one that had, like, information on how to get a coupon for a buffalo snacker chicken sandwich  See, they gotta throw little things in now to make you stop  Little subliminal messages  I don't mind when, you know, they evolve with the technology  I don't mind when the technology's so good  Well, we gotta shut that fucking thing down  Instead of trying to work with it  That's what frustrates me 
[03:02:00]  Because British commercials are funny  They're funny in Europe  They're interesting  And here they stink  Right  There's a reason why  One frame of big Harry Bush  One frame of big Harry Bush  And you would, like, slow-mo through the entire commercial  Right  I say pitch it  They're doing more and more product placement, too  It's gonna go back to old-time TV  Where they just start talking about the products  Hey, Bob Hope for Texaco Star  I gotta tell ya  That's what they're gonna do now  I bet you they start doing that next 
[03:02:30]  But this DVR is too gonna be true  To zip through the commercials  Seinfeld was like  They had so much product placement  That the products actually got to look over the scripts  And recommend changes  Really?  Oh, yeah  It's so dangerous  I'm Lily McBeth for Ginsu  Celebrity endorsement  Can I go to the phone for a second here?  All right  I'd rather you didn't  Jeff  Shut it down  We got it  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, sorry  Just missed a wreck here 
[03:03:00]  Hey, guys  Shit  Sorry  Just watched the car go under a semi  On 294 at Chicago  It's kind of cool  Nice  Wow  Right in front of me  That was kind of cool  I hope it was the last caller we took  Bastard  Holy crap  I hope it was Rob  And he was on a business trip  That just fucked me up  Wow, you really  A car just got railed, huh?  Maybe you should go help the person  Nah, he's got a load to deliver  I was already  I was already rolling past him  He just went underneath 
[03:03:30]  The front end of a semi  And his head's probably gone  Holy shit  That was cool  Was it a cop car  And was Jerry Reed driving the rig?  Just trying to drive under my truck  Hold on to your ass, Fred  Some dumb little rice burner  Tired to get smart  And he went around the front of the semi  And lost it  And then he ended up underneath it  Are you driving around the country with a monkey?  What?  No, not yet  So the guy  Oh, the guy actually got  His truck actually hit the car  No, he  The car lost it in front of the truck  He was changing lanes 
[03:04:00]  A little too fast  Changing lanes  He skid  And then the truck went right into him  When he doubled back  He doubled back  Into the steer tire of the semi  That was sitting next to him  And just demolished his car  Oh, wow  Ended up underneath the drive  To pop the truck up into the air  About six feet  Wow  You just saw all this live?  It just happened  When you guys went to me  That's what happened  Right there  You think he's dead?  Woo  I don't know  Who cares  Fuck him  There you go  That's the rules of the road 
[03:04:30]  I had a good call  You guys rock  I can't handle it anymore  You had a good call  Alright  I was going to shit on Jimmy  But I can't  Because he's my idol  But I love all you guys  Thanks, man  And you guys rock  Bye, fella  What do you like about Jimmy, by the way, Jeff?  Oh, he's my idol  Wait  Oh, no  Hung up on his face  I hope that wasn't another accident  That was a technical glitch  I can't believe Jimmy would hang up  On one of his fans like that  I don't have any button control 
[03:05:00]  I'm over here with a pen  Let's go to Keith and Harrison  Keith  Hey, guys  Oh, by the way  I love you, Opie  Anyway  In Westchester County  I don't know how it works in Manhattan  But in Westchester  You do have to pay for HBO On Demand  Like five bucks a month  Yeah, it's part of the package  Everywhere  No, you're right  You know, you're already paying for On Demand  You're right  You shouldn't pay  You have to pay individually then  I guess, you know, we just don't give them enough money as it is  Yeah, they're just positioning themselves to make more money  You watch  Yeah  See you, guys 
[03:05:30]  Well, I'd hate to see DVD sales affected  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, say a sitcom comes out  And it's really popular  You want the DVD sales  Oh, look who's Mr. HBO over here  I forgot about that  No, I'm just saying  Are you going to get some of that action?  I don't know what the contract is, to be very honest with you  Yes, you do know what it is  You're just not passing  If not, well, your first contract, you don't get  It's when you come up for the second one  If it's a success, then you get some  There's a blurb about Lucky Louie in the paper today  Yeah, yeah, they just mentioned it in the post  Jimmy's part of Lucky Louie, the HBO sitcom  And with Louis C.K.  Following Entourage 
[03:06:00]  Following Entourage in June  Louis C.K.'s HBO stand-up special I saw recently  Very funny  Yeah, Louis is great  Really funny  I think Louis is playing Caroline's this weekend  Is that why they're promoting it?  Oh, yeah  I believe so  Why don't you maybe give him a plug?  Jimmy  What I didn't even think is Louis wouldn't  It's in the back of maybe the  I want to say the post  Where is the boss's plug?  All the way in the back  All the way in the back  The boss needs a plug  No, all the way in the back  Just start over  All the way  No, keep going 
[03:06:30]  Oh, no  You're by the sports section, you nut  It might be Daily News  Oh, it's the Daily News, all their ads  Oh, you had the Daily News  I hate the Daily News  Just go a couple in from the back  I see it  Louis, really a great comic  And you can catch him March 16th through 19th  Oh, okay, it's not until mid-March  Okay  All right, we'll plug the boss then  We can all be away  St. Paddy's Day weekend  Yep  Okay  I want to talk about this MySpace thing  Yeah, the backlash has begun, man  Yeah, the backlash has begun 
[03:07:00]  Everybody that has their MySpace accounts  Seems here  The Department of Homeland Security  Has new computer software  That's combing through people's emails, blogs, and MySpace accounts  Looking for terrorists  That's right  The system's called Advise  Advise  Right, it stands for something  Of course it does  It's an American military thing  I actually did read this  I thought it was the Whopper  But, yeah, so they  And I was looking at a friend of mine's MySpace account 
[03:07:30]  Where he's standing there with a machine gun  Talking about how he loves to shoot things  Yeah, I know  Looking a little Middle Eastern there, Anthony  Now, my MySpace account, of course  I kind of look  Now, if they're combing through these pictures  And they see me holding a gun like that  Is that going to set off some red flags?  How many terrorists do you actually think have MySpace accounts?  Four  I mean, do they go  Like, you go in there and you see that, like, all their friends are named Muhammad  Or  Yeah  Al-Zarqawi's got his set up 
[03:08:00]  With, like, a flowery background  And Alanis Morissette comes up  My favorite song, Death to America  Who's this?  Jimmy  Jimmy  Jimmy  Jimmy's taking a phone call  I'm on the radio  Now, people are personally telling him how much they love him on his personal phone line  I'm sorry I took that  I thought it might be somebody who knew me  Who I was going to scream at for calling me at this hour  But it was just fancy gentlemen  So, what's up with the MySpace?  They're going to be combing through it using this advise software 
[03:08:30]  That's going to, I guess, look for keywords  Right  And phrases  MySpace accounts, blogs  They even said email  Though they didn't really explain how they're getting access to email  I think maybe the comments that you put  Messages you send somebody  I know the comments sections can be quite lengthy  Personal email  I don't know about that  Well, you know, there's  AT&T and some of the providers like that  That have the backbones  Are in trouble  Because they allowed access to the government 
[03:09:00]  Over this whole warrantless wiretapping thing  Yep  It's, there's theories that they're also scanning email as well  So, your major providers have given access to the backbone  To the Department of Homeland Security  Who hook up a system like Carnivore  Do you remember Carnivore?  Carnivore  Yeah  What did that stand for?  Something bad  Yeah  That sits there and scans all the email and looks for keywords  What keywords could they be looking for?  Like, what terrorist is going to 
[03:09:30]  Because if you write terrorist  Hi, I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists  As long as they're not looking for words like  Norton  Lollipop  Secret  Hotel room  School  I'm a terrorist looking for underage terrorists  The number 14  I'm Jim Norton  And I'm a terrorist  It's weird  It's like  And this is where people say slippery slope  Like, you gotta be careful  It doesn't bleed into other areas  I don't want them going after people 
[03:10:00]  For loan sharking  Or prostitution  Or any crime  But for terrorism  If it's only used  Legitimately  For terrorism  But I'm saying  It's the government  They'd never lie  I wouldn't mind it  But I'm afraid it won't be  They use this stuff responsibly  Yeah  They've been using the Patriot Act  For a lot of non-terrorism related cases  Then that's what has to be stopped  Because slippery slope doesn't work  That's like saying  You can't have jails  Because technically  That can be abused  Yes  You know what I mean?  It's like anything can be abused  You just have to fight it in court  Make sure it's not abused 
[03:10:30]  And you know  The legal backlash to MySpace has begun  Like you've got this Connecticut Attorney General  Who has announced a criminal probe into MySpace  Saying that seven underage girls in Connecticut  Were fondled or had consensual sex with adult men  That they'd met on MySpace  So what are they doing?  Are they going after the parents  For not paying attention to what their kids are doing?  Yeah  Or not putting some kind of a monitor  A device on their kid's computer?  Very good  Very good  Bravo  Why don't you look and see what your kids are doing on the computer? 
[03:11:00]  No  A lot of parents don't know  No  We're monitoring software  Shut up  You're going to ruin it  You're going to wreck it for everybody  That's right  You're going to ruin it  That's right  A little fondling  A little fondling  Never heard  Consensual  They're calling MySpace a parent's worst nightmare  Yeah  That was his quote  You know what a parent's worst nightmare should be?  Second jobs  Why don't you stop taking second jobs  And fucking pay attention to your awful kids  Pay for the computer  A parent's worst nightmare  Mom  This is Tyrone 
[03:11:30]  Oh yes  Yeah  MySpace I think is far down on the list  It may be on the list  But I don't think it's the worst nightmare  A parent's worst nightmare is  Grandma is now Grandpa  Another worst nightmare  Or even worse  Mom  Tyrone and I have a special announcement  Followed by a belly pet  Mulata  Mind-run MySpace member  Both websites will be destroyed  As she points out her little baby bump  Because now it's called a baby bump 
[03:12:00]  Yeah that's all mines  My shorty  You put your ear to it  You can hear it complaining  Holy shit  God  All right  So that's  Yeah we got to watch out now  For the government on your MySpace  Why don't we take a look at him?  Well if you're putting  You know  If you're putting  Deflammatory comments  I don't know  What are you going to do though?  What could you put on there  That  What terrorist is going to  Here's pictures of us  Blowing some stuff up 
[03:12:30]  Right  It's my blog  I hate America  I hate the infidels  It's my friend list  Mujahideen humor  Yeah  Glittery comments  I hate the USA  And it sparkles  Yes  Good seeing you at that rally  Looks like you put a few pounds on  When we burned the effigy  LOL  Before we go to break  All the chicks  Are just pictures of veils  She's hot  It's really sexy  It was a great night last night 
[03:13:00]  She got drunk  And her veil fell  And I saw her nose  And then I had  Sexual relations  With a softer boy  Fucking creepy culture  Let's go to Mark in Arizona  Speaking of creepy cultures  Mark  Hey good morning  Arizona?  Oh no  Go ahead Mark  I am shipping out Monday  To go over into  Air up John  And then up into  Eastern Iraq  With the Navy  Yikes  I've been gone for about a year  Hey good times eh  But is there an XM radio 
[03:13:30]  That reaches over there  Does it portable  Like what do they have  The new  I forget what it's called  The new XM  Boy you know  That is a great unit  But sorry  If you have a long cord  You know what  You can get it online though  If XM wants to do the right thing  What they should do  Is figure out  Oh my god Mark  Hold on a second  It's going to Iraq  Don't say anything  XM should figure out  How they can get the boys  To listen to XM  For free over there  Yeah  It can't be that hard  I'd like to find out  If I can get a receiver 
[03:14:00]  That you know  Somehow reaches over there  There's gotta be a way  To do it  Through computer  I think only online  Yeah online  There's no satellite  Over there  Somehow give away  Some free accounts  That the boys  Could get into over there  Didn't they  They had a program  To get free accounts  Didn't they  I have no idea  Like right around Christmas time  That would be a great thing  For XM to do  I bet the satellite traffic  Is a little heavy over Iraq  I don't think  I don't think an XM satellite  Might fit between  Some of the other ones  That are kind of  Repositioned over the area  Trying to call in  Bomber coordinates  You hear our fucking  Awful program 
[03:14:30]  Whip them out  Let's see your tits  Bunch of dopes  And I don't know  We're looking at  Grid 6  5  9  And the tits  On this fucking bitch  That we saw  Driving down the road  The other day  Was what the fuck  Look at the hood  On that one  Oh my god  What happened  There actually  There is satellite radio  Over there  Oh yeah  The world space company  They cover Africa  They cover the Middle East  They cover India  As a huge satellite radio market now  Really  Yeah  You should talk to the world space people  And get on there  I know cause the one guy

[03:16:30]  This is the last day of  Black History Month  Black History Month  Laszlo brought that to our attention  Victory is near  Good riddance  Begins at midnight  Oh  Jesus  Come on now  Guys  We shouldn't be acknowledging other races  For an entire month  No more Maya Angelou  On the radio  But the best part  Someone out there has a sense of humor  They give him the shortest month of the year  That is unbelievable  And every four years  They're like very excited  Because it's leafier  One more day 
[03:17:00]  What are you doing on the 29th?  And I was telling the guys during the break  I was getting my mom a birthday card recently  And they have Black History Month cards  Who do you send those to?  Mostly women I noticed  Like to empower the black woman  Ah  There's actual greeting cards  It's a picture of a burnt out church on the front  Oh jeez  What the hell  That's Laszlo everybody  Laszlo  You're never going to make the top 100  It's not officially part of our radio show  We don't pay him 
[03:17:30]  Mike  That's right  I'm sorry  We're sorry  Chiminy  Jokes  Jokes  Shame  Anyway  Back to Tech Talk with Laszlo  Oh yeah  Where were we?  Jesus  We were  MySpace's parents' worst nightmare  Yep  Wireless camera  For your helmet  Oh yeah  Now this sounds like something I think they've had for years  You put a camera on your helmet  And like a miner could go into a cave or something  And see the  Not that helmet  Is that what you're  Oh no 
[03:18:00]  Not that helmet  Well do tell  You like the way I kind of  Yeah that was kind of  Yeah  They were actually showing this thing at CES  It comes out in like a month and a half  It's from Samsung  And it's a wireless camera lens  That sends a wireless signal back to the camcorder  So you could maybe  You know if you're having a bee contest of some sort  You could tape it to a person's leg  Or their hog  And get that unique angle  Oh okay  So instead of the whole camera having to be under there  It's pretty small  How big would you say? 
[03:18:30]  It's about the size of a D-cell battery  And uh  Wow  C-cell battery  That'll go like anywhere  Right  And then it transmits back to a camcorder  Right  You could put it on your dick  Well yeah if you wanted to  If you wanted to like the  You know a day in the life  Of Ben's hog  Or something  Oh hog cam  Right  It's a hog cam  That could be fun to do one day  Put it up on  Reality show  I'll talk  Boys you're way behind the times  I've had a hog cam for many years  No but it's good for like snowboarding 
[03:19:00]  Or mountain biking  But I'm sure it's going to be used  For a lot more deviant purposes  We said that the other day  Yeah  All this cool tech shit  It has a good use  But we always bring it right back  To the porno  Right  Porno  Like the pal talk  That we're having fun with  You know that was invented  For stupid video conferencing  With your  You know with your little work buddy  That's like Anthony said yesterday  In Japan or something  And you don't want to fly to Japan  You have to have a meeting  In the boardroom  You do it all 
[03:19:30]  Over the video conferencing  That's right  That's why they invented that stuff  Originally  Yeah  That's well that was the initial pitch  That was made to get financing  Because you can't just  You can't be the business guy  Going in and going  There are going to be people  Fucking and sucking  And we can look in  You know it's like  Eh I'm a business guy  Bob is in Japan  And we're here  We can meet  And look at each other  Don't forget  Hurrah  Hurrah  Hurrah  Hurrah  We can share the graphs  And various records 
[03:20:00]  That we need to show each other  Hurrah  Hurrah  Hurrah  It's like these people  Buy these $700 smartphones  They can do all these amazing things  And what do they use it for?  Porno  Downloading porn  Downloading porn  Pornography  Google actually released some statistics  That said that  8.5% of people  Sitting down  In front of their computer  And doing a Google search  Are looking for adult content  Porno  But people on their phones  On their smartphones  Who have like a web browser  That are doing Google searches  20%  One in five  Is looking for porn 
[03:20:30]  Wow  Do you watch porn on your phone, Anthony?  Um  I haven't  Let me think  I think I might have  Do you have porn on your phone?  Yeah, I could get it  I get a lot of like channels  On my phone now  They keep adding new ones  Which is great  When I first signed up  All I got was like Fox News  The government of this fine country  Has to finally admit it  We all love porn  We enjoy it  Stop it  It's a large segment of this society  That likes watching it  And needs places to download it  Watch it  Even if it's on the bus 
[03:21:00]  Next to somebody  On your phone  And you take all  Rubbing against them  If you take all our porn away  What we'll do  We'll go right back to being cavemen  And we'll start  Sketching out some fucking scenes  Draw it on the wall  Dragging bitches  Do you honestly think though  Like I'm taking the other side here  Because I'm for downloading it anywhere  I could give a shit  But do you honestly think  That on your phone  That you really need porno  To be available on your cell phone  So that if you're 
[03:21:30]  In a bus  On the subway  Walking down the street  You need it that badly  Do you see that  As somebody who has a problem  That as being satisfied  Or a convenience  For just the normal person  That's kind of into looking  At naked chicks  I see it more as  You're catering to someone  That has a real problem  If they need to look at porn  On their phone  But the numbers don't lie  20%  I understand  Because it's available  20%  Like I would look  I'm saying  You know 
[03:22:00]  You're right  I'm looking  I don't think  I think people are doing that  Because just like anything else  It's just killing time  While you're commuting  Or whatever  Yeah but  Of course there's people  With problems  That need to see porn  All the time  But there's also people  Like they like their porn  They need to kill a little time  In between you know  Commutes  And that's what they're doing  Yeah but  Typically when you watch porn  You're gonna spank one out  Yeah there's a  There's a reason for it  And you  Either get to heat it up  Right  It's a mobile phone  You're out being mobile  Maybe in public  Or in a place of business

[03:23:30]  And he's just driving  And he's kind of  Has eyes half shut  He's got that smile  On his face  That's Jimmy  That's good old Jimmy  When he's got a boner  Alright listen  We got  Can you rewind the show  For a second Anthony  That's amazing  Wireless cameras  For your penis  Yeah  Let's say hi  To Nick in Cleveland  Nick  Yeah  I just wanted to say  A day in the life  Of Ben's hog  Plenty of room  For a camera  And enough room  For a cameraman too  We have a guy  Holding a boom mic 
[03:24:00]  Well  His comment  Was a lot of funnier  It said you would need  A whole camera crew  A crew  He's quite afraid  You'd wreck it  So he says  You need a whole camera crew  You're on  You're on  I'm trying to be better  You have been better  With that one  Like that scene from Dune  With the snake  Coming out of the sand  Sometimes you're  Gary Giveaway  Gary Giveaway  I love that one  Alright  So we're  Pouring on the phone  Yeah and the Google thing  You know the Justice Department  Is trying to get a week's worth 
[03:24:30]  Of search records  From Google  And Google's been fighting it  Good  Good for Google  Yeah the Justice Department  Is probably going to end up  Getting it  I think they'll get it  We're at a point now  Years ago  It was very hard  For the government  To get information  On people  Even though they did  But it was a lot more difficult  Because there were only  So many outlets  That had your information  There was your phone  At home  Your social security number  And your license  That's like pretty much  Was it  As far as 
[03:25:00]  Where you could get  Information on somebody  Now  You're putting  All kinds of information  Out on the web  About yourself  What you do  What you like  What your business  Practices are  Credit cards  Things like this  Are everywhere  And I think  The companies  Aren't as strong  As they seem  To have been  Back then  Like the phone company  If the government  Went to them  Years ago  They'd say  No  We're not giving you  The records  We'll go public  And then the public  Finds out that the  Government's trying  To get phone records  There's a big stink 
[03:25:30]  About it  You get like  Google  They're just kids  That made millions  And billions  And millions  Of dollars  They don't want  Any trouble  They don't want  Court cases  So they're more  Likely to go  You know  Alright  Take the info  We'd rather not fight  They're accusing Google  Of helping child  Pornographers  Because that's what  This is about  It's about that  Coppola  That the fucking  Clinton administration  Coppola makes  Some great movies  Like the child  Online Protection Act  It's lost in the  Supreme Court  Twice  As unconstitutional 
[03:26:00]  Well you know what  Because of some  And I'm playing  Devil's advocate  Because of some  Ah take the horns off  No the tail  And the pitchfork  You go all out  Anthony I don't  Have that on  Yes sir  In what scenario  I understand  Unconstitutional  A lot of times  They're like  They'll fight  The constitutionality  Or something  Because of a little  Glitch  Or a little  You know  Under what scenario  Is that hurting  A law abiding  American citizen  When they're going  After people  Who are trading 
[03:26:30]  Or dealing  In child pornography  Or looking for it  Because most people  I'm saying who look for it  Probably have it  That's the usual  Battle cry  Is hey  If you're not doing  Anything wrong  You have nothing  To worry about  But I mean  This goes beyond  Not paying taxes  Doing anything wrong  This goes beyond  You know  Illegally trading music  Or doing  Or even gambling  Or bullshit  But  That's that  What you call  Slippery slope  Again  To me  The slippery slope  Argument doesn't work  I like to call it  The greasy Asian  The copa  Right  If whatever you want 
[03:27:00]  To call it  Fine by me  Alright  So they will always argue  The sweaty Chinaman  And they'll say  But again  Back to my other  My other point  Then you shouldn't  Have jails  Because slippery slope  Can always take you  From one point  To anywhere you need to be  And I'm not saying  It never has merits  But you can't use  When you're dealing  With child pornography  How can that possibly  If that's really  What they're looking for  Because a lot of the laws  That are made  To protect children  Against child pornography  Or protect us  Against terrorism  Get used for things  Like the war on drugs 
[03:27:30]  Which again  Sounds fine on the outside  But then it's like  Is the wiretapping  Going to some poor bastard  Who just wants to smoke a joint  Because it's included  In the war on drugs  That we just happen  To be able to use  This law  That was an anti-terrorist law  But since we're able to  And then you're just  Winding up  You know  Wiring people  That might not really  Be doing anything that bad  What you're talking about  Is the abuse  Of a legitimate law  Yeah  I'm not saying that  Which happens all the time  It does  But too trustworthy  Not at all  But by that logic 
[03:28:00]  We shouldn't have any laws  Because they can all be abused  Anarchy man  But you know what I'm  Anarchy man  Anthony  I'm with you Jim  You know what I'm saying though  It's like  That's why slippery slope  The reason that they want  These Google records  Is they want to prove  That people are online  Searching for child pornography  Because they're trying  To get this COPA law  Re-established  And the law says  That if you publish material  That is harmful to minors  You have to use  A credit card verification check  Meaning that  Foundry Music  OpieandAnthony.com 
[03:28:30]  Everything  Right  Would have to have  A credit card verification check  To make sure that people  That are accessing  Your website  Are of age  That's disgusting  How about the parents  And guardians  Put up software  That's available  To keep their kids  From looking at this shit  Like a fist  Thank you  Face  Alright we only got  Two minutes left  There's a couple other things  That are very interesting  That we could go through  Really fast here  Laszlo  There are  I like the big brother  School  The Japanese  This is my favorite  Story about the Japanese  You know everybody's got  These bluetooth headsets  You see Hila  Walking around with them  Of course 
[03:29:00]  In Japan  Like the Borg  Right  It's a disgrace  To look like you're crazy  Really  So they're wireless  Bluetooth headsets  They're attaching wires to  So people don't think  They're talking to them  So under the semblance  Of sanity  They think you blur  Out the pubic hair  When you're shitting  Into a bride's mouth  You'd hate to look nutty  What else there Laszlo  Nutty culture  What else  I like the big brother  In the cafeteria  Yeah the big brother  School cafeteria  What's that about  Houston's got a school 
[03:29:30]  Cafeteria program now  Where parents can go online  And see what their kids  Had for lunch  And they can set restrictions  On if their kids  Can have dessert that day  When they go through lines  And so when the kid  Brings the food  To the checkout counter  It'll say  I'm sorry  Your mom said  A restriction  No dessert  That's never going to work  They also have  This is going to be  A parent out there  That lets their kid  Get whatever the hell  They want  And then that kid  Will help out  His friends  That have the  Piss test  That have the strict parents  And there are  Electronic devices  That can be put  On your child  So when they arrive  At school  It's red 
[03:30:00]  When they walk  Through the door  And you can get  Verification that your kid  Actually went to the school  We're going down that road  I'm telling you  It's already happened  But I mean  It's going to be mainstream  I mean  Parents are going to be  Tagging their kids  You watch  But it's good  Let them take responsibility  For the little fucker  So we don't have to  Watch out for them  It takes the village  Does it fat calves  I want to personally thank  Mila Jovovich  For coming in this morning  Oh yeah  Thank you  Ultraviolet  Her movie coming out  So long ago now  Check it out  She's a doll
