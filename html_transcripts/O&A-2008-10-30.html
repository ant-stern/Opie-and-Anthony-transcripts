<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast heavily featured the Philadelphia Phillies' World Series victory.  Opie and Anthony, visibly intoxicated, celebrated the win with boisterous, albeit arguably disingenuous, proclamations of their Philly fandom, despite Anthony's admitted Long Island roots.  They reacted to the game's surprisingly short duration, contrasting it with the perceived slow pace of modern baseball, and mocked various commentators, particularly targeting Joe Buck for his perceived lack of excitement.  The hosts played multiple replays of the winning moment, including a humorous clip from a Japanese broadcast.

A significant portion of the show revolved around a rambling, profane, and comedic bit where Opie invented a tough childhood in West Philadelphia. This led to a caller challenging Opie's story due to the area's predominantly non-white demographics.  Opie's response was a series of escalating, absurd, and exaggerated tales, culminating in a  "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"-style rap about his fictional, hard-knock life in the city.

A repo man called in, providing a firsthand account of the chaotic and celebratory atmosphere in Philadelphia following the Phillies' win.  Later, Jay Moore joined the show, participating in a series of disconnected, often nonsensical and profane, jokes and comedic exchanges with the hosts, including impressions and a movie quote game. The broadcast concluded with a promotional announcement for a future segment showcasing strippers celebrating the release of Kevin Smith's "Zack and Miri Make a Porno."

[00:00:00]  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-CANADA, 877-438-9677.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Jimmy, you want to interview Alan Alda?  Okay.  So, let's get to the meat of the issue.  You had AIDS.  How long did you have AIDS for?  I think about six months. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, I must have had a light cage.  Did you notice that the women really like the Obama guy?  Because he's got a huge ****.  Well done.  That's why.  Hello, sir.  This is operator A-Zero for the IP relay call.  Do you know how to use relay?  No.  No, you ****.  No, I'm sorry.  I mean, no.  Calling for supervisor assistance, please hold.  Oh, boy.  Now you've done it.  Oh, I thought that was a computer voice.  You went in and dropped an A-bomb.  That was a real voice?  What do you think?  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  It's a good day for us long-suffering Phillies fans.  Oh, finally.  You've been a long-suffering Phillies fan?  When did this happen?  What are you talking about?  Everyone knows I've been a Phillies fan since I was a little taut.  Growing up in Philly?  Growing up in Philly, yes. 
[00:01:30]  West Philly.  It was rough in West Philly.  What?  Is it?  Oh, my God.  I was just a little kid when they won it in 1980.  And now, 28 years later, us long-suffering Phillies fans can rejoice.  It's been a long night, Ant.  Hanging with the Philly crew, just celebrating this unbelievable victory.  I thought you were born and raised on Long Island. 
[00:02:00]  No, no, no.  I'm changing my past.  Oh, okay.  No, now I'm from Philly.  Grew up in West Philly.  If you know anything about West Philly, man.  I'm from the streets.  Oh.  I'm from the streets, bro.  Are you?  I'm drunk.  I'm happy.  I just don't know which Philly shirt to wear today.  I'm not buying this act.  Make sure the price tags are off.  I don't know which one to wear, the green one or the red one. 
[00:02:30]  Anyone can wear the red one, but the green one, you know.  Yeah, I'd say wear the green one.  Shows you're Irish as well, and everyone knows I'm just about 100% Irish as well.  It's apparently the Phillies one, huh?  Oh, God, do they.  Phone calls all night, congratulating each other.  Congratulations to you.  Congratulations to me.  I had everything to do with this victory.  Oh, you did?  Oh, God, yeah.  I could not care less. 
[00:03:00]  What is it, I could care less?  Whatever.  I think you know what it is.  I hear you.  There's none more less I could care.  God, when am I going to sober up from this victory?  Oh, really?  Just that partying?  Just rocking.  Yeah.  Throwing back shots.  A lot of, woo, Phillies.  And I'm not one of those, like, soft fans where I find a bar in New York that has the game on just for, you know,  Philly people. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  I went downtown Philly last night.  I just got back.  How do you?  I was, oh.  Literally a couple hours ago.  My God, man.  Well, good for you and your Phillies.  Woo!  That's how baseball should be played, by the way.  Three innings, excitement, a little over an hour, and you're done with the game.  That is hysterical.  It's just like, eh, here's the World Series.  It's three games, three innings.  I want to start a mini-game baseball league. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, that's nice.  People would watch, I guess.  It's three innings.  That's it.  Three innings.  And you could get your monster pitcher that throws 110 miles an hour to rock every pitch  because he knows he's not going to throw his arm out because it's three innings.  Whole game, just.  I think there's a market for that.  I really do.  It's like watching, like, an hour TV show, you know, a couple times a week.  Three lousy innings.  Who can't sit through that?  But that Fox and that Major League Baseball are trying to stretch it out. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, really?  I'm surprised they didn't do a whole, you know, national anthem and, you know, pre-game show  for the three innings.  Yeah, it is odd because I guess they must have lost some revenue that they could have been  playing commercials.  Yeah, sure.  Playing a whole other game or something.  Yeah, but the Phillies won it.  Good for them.  Hey, wait a minute.  Mike is calling me out on something here.  What are you, crazy, Mike?  What's up, Mike?  Well, I'm not really calling you out. 
[00:05:00]  I just want to make the comment.  I don't know anybody that's white that lives in West Philly.  There's not one white person in West Philly.  Now, Southwest, that's where I'm from.  There's white people there.  That's the beauty of me.  I was the only white guy in the ghetto.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well...  I grew up tough.  Me and Will Smith.  He's right.  Will Smith's from West Philly.  It was me and Will, man.  Yeah, it was the Oakland section.  But it's funny when you said that. 
[00:05:30]  You said West Philly.  I'm thinking, geez, you know, like, stand on 52nd and Morgan and announce you're there.  See how long you live.  Why do you think I'm such an a-hole, man?  I had a fight every day on the streets of West Philly.  I had to fight my way out of that neighborhood and make something of myself.  Did you really?  But I never forgot my support for the Phillies.  I don't think there's been a white person in West Philly since, like, 1950.  Look, this is all I have to say.  In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days. 
[00:06:00]  Son.  Wow.  Chilling out, maxing, relaxing, all cool.  That was me.  Well, there's certainly a lot of electricity down there.  That's all I wanted to say.  Thanks for ruining my bit, Mike.  Jesus.  How about you go with it?  And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood.  I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.  She said, you're moving with your auntie and uncle to Long Island. 
[00:06:30]  Damn.  You're rapping.  No, I'm just reciting what I'm all about.  All right, turn that off.  Jesus.  We have a little observation about the big win.  The big win for the Phillies.  Come on in for the big win.  Do you want to hear the Japanese call?  Do you want to hear Joe Buck's boring call?  Or do you want to hear Harry Callis' extremely boring call? 
[00:07:00]  All the above.  Which one do you want to start with?  Of course, no.  All right, let's start with Joe Buck.  Nothing says excitement like Joe Buck, man.  He knows how to, you know, bring it all home in the end.  It was called a swinging strike by home plate umpire Jeff Kellogg.  What a flake.  Nothing in two.  Nothing in two.  Phillies are world champions. 
[00:07:30]  That's it, huh?  Wow.  The old whoof.  That's just like, do you believe in miracles?  Joe Buck stinks.  He could call a good game, but, like, he doesn't care.  He didn't care about this one, you could tell.  He doesn't give a crap.  It's better than the Phillies win.  I think you need to do something in between the two, you know what I mean?  Don't get too hacky, but somehow show some excitement.  The Phillies.  Joe Buck, he admitted in an interview this year that he doesn't even like baseball. 
[00:08:00]  So it's, why are you calling these games?  He doesn't watch baseball.  What does he like?  He does watch baseball.  He calls about a hundred of these a year.  That's the only time he watches it.  What's his sport?  Football.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah.  And, you know, he does the Sunday games.  But, like, the call last year for the Red Sox, same thing.  Red Sox win the World Series.  Who cares?  I hear him packing up to leave.  Oh, yeah.  He's hearing shuffling of things and a coat going on a zipper being zipped. 
[00:08:30]  Hey, Phillies win.  Well, this one's a little better.  A, I hate the pile-on, and B, the Philly fanatic is ruining everything for me.  Yeah.  That was the Japanese call.  And here's the difference, Anthony. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  That was a double.  That was just a double?  Yes.  No way.  Look at the fires down in Philly.  I started that fire.  It's still lit.  Nice.  Nice.  That was me.  It's got to be fun to be down there.  Let me hear that call again.  All right.  This is just for a lousy double that brought in an RBI.  I don't know.  I thought it was for a fanatic.  It was filmed underhand.  Any chance to shoot.  Wow, what happened there? 
[00:09:30]  That was old historical audio.  And this is it right here.  Philly's winning.  The Japanese version.  You know, it is a really big deal to win the World Series. 
[00:10:00]  Joe Buck should be fired, now that I think about it. 
[00:10:30]  This game is being shown all over the world.  There's interest in this all over the world now because of the players coming from everywhere, right?  And Joe Buck, Philly's winning the world.  You've got to go with over-the-top excitement, now that I think about it.  Maybe not the catchphrases like our pal that calls the Yankees games.  But, you know, this thing is being shown everywhere.  Here's the last part of that play.  And then finally, you've got Harry Callis, I believe. 
[00:11:00]  I thought you were going to say Harry Carey.  I know.  They brought him back.  Harry Callis has been calling Phillies games for almost 50 years, 40-some-odd years, or around 40 years.  God bless him.  Now, you're a long-suffering announcer for the Phillies, right?  You would think he would just have an aneurysm if the Phillies won, right?  Certainly.  This is what you got last night.  The 0-2 pitch, swing and a miss, stuck him out. 
[00:11:30]  The Philadelphia Phillies are 2008 world champions of baseball.  At least it had some kind of oomph to it.  He's been waiting 40 years to do that.  Maybe he can't get the excitement out.  Yeah.  Maybe his doctors warned him, huh?  Yeah.  Keep your excitement level down.  You've got a pacemaker.  Be careful.  Let's say hi to Mark in Jersey.  Mark.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Mark.  Philly is a freaking madhouse. 
[00:12:00]  I couldn't even...  I'm a repo man.  I couldn't even get into Phillies.  My boss told me to just stay out of there.  They're flipping over cars.  They're setting stuff on fire.  It's complete chaos over there, and it's still going on.  I kind of believe you.  Yeah, it's true.  My boss sends me a text and says, do not go into Philadelphia.  It is a zoo.  I think it's a day off for everybody, too.  Oh, yeah, but...  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie. 
[00:12:30]  What's up, bub-bu-boys?  Hey, Charlie.  Last night was a great night.  Phillies win the World Series.  Opie's sports course is broken.  And I'm sure Obama's infomercial converted Anthony.  We're going to get into, you know, we've got to clear the field so Anthony can have plenty  of time to talk about the Obama infomercial.  A lot of things happened yesterday.  And guns.  Maybe we'll take an early break here so we can clear the field for Ant.  Don't get him starred yet.  Yeah, please. 
[00:13:00]  We don't want to rush this one.  Steve in Philly, how are you?  Hey, what's up, bub?  I just want to congratulate you, too, as well.  The curse is broken to hell with the Phillies.  You're more important than them.  I think I also picked the Celtics last year, my friend.  I got a nice little streak going.  I mean, I don't pick the team until there's two left, but still, I'm doing pretty good now.  Yes, you are.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Congratulations.  All right.  Let's say hi to Pete in Virginia.  Pete.  Hey, how do we know that Japanese version was actually real? 
[00:13:30]  I don't believe you.  What do you mean?  It could have just been anything.  We couldn't tell.  That's true.  We don't know.  Yeah.  He could have just been cursing, like graphically describing some sex act, and we just play  it and go, yeah, I guess it's the game.  That's what we should have done.  You put some cheering behind it.  See, if we prepared for this radio show, we would have had three Japanese clips, and  you had to guess which one was the final out in the World Series.  And the third one would have been one of them. 
[00:14:00]  Something horrific.  Just horrible.  Something horrific.  And then you just put baseball-like noises behind it.  Well, that crack.  Like a crowd noise.  The crack of the bat.  Yeah.  And I'm just describing horrific sex acts.  Absolutely.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  877-212-0&A.  Keep the phone calls coming.  Today is the big day, Jimmy.  We get to see strippers stripping for $1,000.  We do.  In honor of Kevin Smith's new movie, Zack and Miri Make a Porno. 
[00:14:30]  Do we have a...  Anyone else notice all the advertising for the movie, but they don't say make a porno?  Zack and Miri.  Zack and Miri.  That's going to hurt the film a little bit, because it doesn't describe what the hell it's  about.  No.  Make a porno.  That's the big get.  I know, because that just sounds like, what?  Like some kind of romantic comedy.  Right.  And what, um, how many of these young ladies do we have?  Stunt?  How many?  Uh, there were four that qualified.  We'll see who shows up.  They should be here about 745.  Four girls. 
[00:15:00]  You know we're going to end up seeing, like, E-Rock strip or something.  Wouldn't you think a K-Rock, one of the K-Rock girls would show up?  Oh, they're not allowed to.  No?  Remember?  No.  Remember when we had that whole contest, we were trying to get a few of them naked, and  like, eh.  Yeah.  Corporate said, blah, blah, blah.  They don't have to get naked.  Well, pasties.  Something.  But bikini, even at this point.  They weren't allowed to show cleavage.  Do you remember how, like, tight they played it?  A girl, a girl in a snowsuit at this point.  Yeah.  I don't care.  One of those big, puffy snowsuits. 
[00:15:30]  You are right.  Anything.  You're right, by the way.  We've seen it all.  I mean, back, back when we were fighting the good fight.  Yeah.  We were like old veterans of a war.  We saw it all.  And now, like, we're, we're living in some, we're living at the top of the mountain, and  we haven't seen a girl in so long that even a girl in a snowsuit would get us going.  You're right.  It'd kind of be funny to watch a girl with her hood up in a big snowsuit trying to pole  dance.  We saw so much that, you know, the couple was having sex in the corner. 
[00:16:00]  We were talking to Greg Brady.  Yeah.  And he's like, why are you interviewing me when that's going on?  And we're like, oh, yeah, that.  Ah.  Because we were, like, jaded by that point.  So what?  But now, you know what?  Even just seeing a little cleavage, I think, I think we're going to need some cleanup time.  Quick break.  We'll continue.  Anthony's got a lot to say about the Obama infomercial.  Yeah.  And the gun store.  Oh, the whole thing.  And what was the other thing you were talking about?  Oh, we'll get into it.  All right.  Yeah.  No teases needed. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, no.  No teases necessary.  Opie and Anthony.  Come on!  Opie and Anthony.  Bitter, angry motherfuckers.  Fuck!  Fuck!  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy's a realist.  You're a racist.  Fuck!  And I'm clueless.  Jay Moore's on the line, but I can't get it.  Oh, my God.  Jay Moore.  Don't go anywhere.  Can't you use the keyboard?  No.  Hiya, boys.  There he is.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Before I put on my friend Jay, I wanted to fan how short I am.  Another ah.  You boys, boy, you're good.  But a few days in a row, you've been cagging good old Al. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to do all the commercials, like the quicker picker-upper when I work on my nails.  I don't have Propecia.  Yeah, people are saying you have alopecia.  Alopecia, Propecia.  That's why I'm working on phonics, Anthony.  Because I don't know certain words.  I just know in 88 minutes, my hair was orange. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, it was.  I was Pesci and JFK.  My wig was crooked and I wanted to throw a gay party with a friend.  I'm so impressed, Jimmy.  You get to tell jokes and you think you're special because you're painted a fucking male.  What movie?  I'm going to guess Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.  No.  Why don't you just, like, embarrass everybody, you idiot?  Oh, that's been great, Colin. 
[00:18:00]  That's why he's not here.  I don't know consciousness and just yell out random quotes and go, okay, quick, what movie?  And then when they're wrong, go, I'm smarter than you.  I knew what I was saying.  Yo, you should let Tracy Morgan talk to Jimmy.  I got schizophrenia.  I just dropped my belly off in preschool.  It's belly.  And a doo-doo diaper, pepper.  Jay, please put Colin in Reservoir Dogs. 
[00:18:30]  Guys, look, you know, obviously there was a wretch in this whole operation.  And I'm no more than me.  I'm pretty goddamn sure I wasn't here.  I don't know, the guy definitely fucking freaked out in there.  But he seems, I don't know, he seems pretty okay now.  He's a big guy.  I don't know.  Holy shit.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  You're holding a desert eagle.  He's asking you if you want to bark all day.  Remember, you know, a guy like that doesn't have one.  You know, I mean, I just wish it. 
[00:19:00]  We need to get in touch with Joe.  Get this guy to the hospital.  He's getting blood on my shoes.  Finicky I am when it comes to my LA gear sneakers.  Holy shit.  I hate the goddamn words, stupid.  Stupid.  Holy shit.  I'm Colin driving around the valley with Bobby Kelly in the back.  I broke my fucking stomach, man.  Are you going to be okay, stupid?  What are you?  Shut up.  You're bleeding all over my car.  You're dead. 
[00:19:30]  That dumb bitch.  You know, if I got to shoot some cop,  I've done the difference between me doing, you know, 10 years.  You're a lie.  You know, that's what I talk about in a meeting today.  I was really stressed out.  I went to like five meetings in 10 minutes.  That's what I do.  I go, hi, my name's Colin.  And then I run out the room and go to another one.  Because I don't want to listen to anybody else talk because they're boring.  They always outdo each other.  Holy shit, dude.  God, is that a fucking perfect Colin?  I think he's having a nervous breakdown out there now. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, damn.  Will Brophy.  And Manthony.  And Manthony, yeah.  That's right.  Brophy and Ro Brophy and Manthony.  This is fucking awful.  This is wonderful.  You're listening to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm him, Norton.  Yes.  Him, Norton, man.  The virus.  XM 202.  Sirius 197.  197. </pre>
