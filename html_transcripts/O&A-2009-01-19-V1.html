<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie jokingly accusing Anthony of faking illness to avoid working on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  Opie, along with Jim Norton, hosted the show, welcoming in-studio guests Patrice O'Neal and Robert Kelly, later joined by Jeffrey Ross.  Opie recounted successful stand-up gigs in Atlantic City, despite the Eagles' loss, shifting the conversation to sports and the history of the Chicago Cardinals.  The hosts then launched into a series of anecdotes about their producer, Kenny, detailing his sleeping in his car, beer-related mishaps, and near-sleep driving incidents, interspersed with a bizarre Martin Luther King Jr. song performed by Kenny and a pre-release play of U2's "Get on Your Boots."

The discussion moved to the Notorious B.I.G. biopic and its violent after-parties. Patrice O'Neal joined the conversation, offering humorous commentary on the holiday and the seeming absence of Black people from the streets.  The conversation drifted to Obama's popularity, "The Beast" (the presidential limousine), and speculation about the Secret Service's supposed analysis of the President's waste.  A "FU Line" segment featured listener-submitted angry messages.  The hosts, along with Patrice, then reviewed several films, including "Taken," "Step Brothers," "Zohan," "The Spirit," "The Wrestler," "Seven Pounds," and animated films like *WALL-E* and *Horton Hears a Who*, criticizing actors like Keanu Reeves, Hayden Christensen, and Sam Jackson's post-"Pulp Fiction" career.  A detailed discussion of the "Miracle on the Hudson" followed, including humorous commentary on Sully Sullenberger.  Listener calls about the Biggie movie and *Seven Pounds* further fueled the movie discussion.


A caller, Malik, from Asbury Park, joined the discussion about the Biggie biopic, giving it a 6 or 7 out of 10 rating, sparking debate about its accuracy. The conversation shifted to Jim Norton's stand-up comedy and the show's surprisingly large, hidden black fanbase.  Malik's playful teasing led to humorous exchanges. The discussion about “The Beast” continued, with multiple callers, including Fontaine, contributing further (and sometimes conflicting) details about presidential security.  The show then covered 50 Cent's lyrical abilities and displayed an unretouched photo of a young Madonna, prompting humorous commentary on her appearance.  The broadcast concluded with a discussion of the Super Bowl, Keanu Reeves' acting (including a *Speed* scene and a Canadian TV appearance), Nicolas Cage's acting, and other actors.

A significant portion of the show focused on comedic critiques of *Face/Off* and *The Wicker Man*, highlighting their absurdity.  A 13-year-old, JC, and his mother were in studio, leading to sexually charged comments from the hosts directed towards JC’s mother.  The hosts also discussed Joaquin Phoenix's transition to rapping, using vulgar language to describe his appearance. A heated phone conversation with Phil, a vegan vehemently opposed to a previous segment featuring a man who ate mice, ensued, escalating into an exchange filled with insults and homophobic slurs. The segment ended with promotions for Jimmy Norton's book, Ashley Madison, Fedor Emelianenko's appearance, and discussion of social media and *Quincy, M.E.*, along with another Kenny song.

Meat consumption became a central theme, with Patrice O'Neal graphically detailing the effects of diet on his bowel movements and providing a detailed account of his colonoscopy.  The discussion covered animal slaughter methods, with various opinions and listener calls contributing.  Fedor Emelianenko, a mixed martial arts fighter, then appeared as a guest, discussing his career, training, and personal life alongside the hosts’ crude humor.  The segment included ad reads for Porn.com and the Affliction M1 Global event.

Fedor Emelianenko’s interview continued, comparing him to other fighters, discussing the rise of MMA stars like Brock Lesnar and Kimbo Slice, and the differences between Pride and UFC fanbases.  The hosts' crude jokes continued, and Emelianenko’s entourage was described as intimidating.  The conversation included discussions of his preferences (movies, comedians), hampered by language barriers.  A promotional read for an Affliction MMA event followed, along with a call with Bob May (the Robot from *Lost in Space*).  Further banter between Patrice, Robert Kelly, and the hosts focused on their weight and physical appearances using offensive language. A discussion of a comedy competition and a remixed song about a broken knee concluded this segment.

The show featured a call from "Big Kev," who wore a robot costume, leading to mockery of his mishaps.  The conversation shifted to *Star Wars* costume actors and their interview challenges, with Kathy criticizing the hosts' treatment of Big Kev.  Discussion then turned to "hypermilers," with a news report being played, followed by mockery of their extreme gas-saving methods. The segment concluded with multiple obscene calls and a final obscene phone call before the sign-off.  Jeffrey Ross was present in studio for a portion of these discussions.

[00:15:30]  yeah all right we'll get into the obama discussion after the break i watched that damn train ride all  all day what was it yesterday or saturday it was saturday right taking the slow train ride from philly  to washington stopping along the way giving speeches kind of doing the lincoln thing but i was thinking  to myself he's not really doing the lincoln thing because lincoln started in where springfield  illinois and lincoln's was a secret leak well of course because we didn't have ipods and uh the 
[00:16:00]  internet well they're how do you get the word out they were worried about uh people taking shots at  them and right and when you go through towns the railroad tracks weren't connected so they used to  have to take the cars off and pull them by horse over to the next station it was a mess so obama kind  of wanted to do the lincoln thing but he kind of did a very short version of the lincoln thing  because lincoln was on the road for how long but i think it was nine or ten days nine or ten days and  i uh i read that he gave a hundred speeches yeah before he got to washington a hundred speeches so 
[00:16:30]  that would be about 10 a day if it was nine or ten days right unbelievable well they had to spread  the word they probably misquoted them they had no idea what you're saying now you just say it once  and it's done it's easier now yeah exactly let's uh listen to this new u2 song we're supposed to wait  till nine but but come on in this day and age why bother uh the song is called get on your boots  checking it out for the first time right here on the opian anthony show starring jim norton  the future needs a big kiss winds blow with a twist never seen a moon like this can you see it too

I like the way it started  Top Logic likes it  He's saying it looks like U2's been listening to Beck  Has a little bit of Beck in there  Yeah, exactly 
[00:20:30]  It's called Get on Your Boots, U2  I liked it when it first started, but then I stopped liking it  I don't hate it, but  That's alright  It's one of those songs I think it's going to have to grow on you  Now make believe we didn't play it because this radio station is going to promote all day  That they're debuting it at 9 o'clock or something like that, right?  Yeah  That's their big thing today  That's the thing they decided to do today, right?  Yes, sir  Just spend all their time promoting the fact they got a 3-minute U2 song  And they're going to make you wait until 9  We don't make you wait  No  We probably should have, though  It's alright 
[00:21:00]  Alright, we're going to take a quick break and continue  Patrick should be joining the program after the break  Opie and Anthony, stay there  The Opie and Anthony Show  Nice  Still love this song  What is this?  Does it go into it a little bit or just the riff?  Oh, that sucks  99 pounds, but the bitch ain't won  Jay-Z  I guess in honor of MLK Day  To play some black artists  Is that what? 
[00:21:30]  What the idea is  I'm praying  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show  It's time  Anthony  Who is under the weather  Did you see him down there at all?  I saw him Friday  I saw him Friday  He came to the show  And  Yeah, we hung for a bit at the show  And I guess he went out and  I don't know if he hit the tables or not  Yeah  But I talked to Keith  Saturday  And he said that  He said his voice was  Shots were going to talk  Rumor has it he's still down there  As of last night 
[00:22:00]  I don't know  I guess that's on Friday night  Like sick in his room or something  So  Maybe we'll get an update later today  Maybe he could call on the show  Or we could try calling him or something  877-212-ON-A  Also want to say hi to my fellow Twitters  As Patrice O'Neal enters the studio  Finally decided to join one of these  Social networking sites  Have you checked out Twitter yet?  I've never heard of it  Twitter's alright  It's a very basic like  Social networking site 
[00:22:30]  Very basic  I never really got into the Facebook or MySpace  But I like the Twitter  It's a 140 character blog site  So you can put in a message any time of day or night  People can follow you  But you're limited to 140 characters  Yeah, so you can't babble  You gotta make it quick and easy  You know, with just dumb little updates  And your followers get your updates  But 140 characters  How many words is that?  That's very small  It's a mere paragraph, my friend  So it's more like, you know  Hey, this is Jim 
[00:23:00]  I'm about to go on stage at the Brigada  I just do the phone things  I just do the same on my phone  It's pretty much what you're doing with the phone  And stuff like that  Yeah  But if you want to find me  Opie Radio  One word on Twitter.com  As we say hi to Patrice O'Neal  Good morning  How are you, sir?  Not bad  I wanted you to sleep in a little bit  Well, I'm not all the way  Huh?  Sleeping the entire day  Well, I like doing radio with you  It seems like a lot more white people in the streets today  It's some type of solid area  I thought it was a day off  All the black people 
[00:23:30]  Interesting  All the black people went south  I'm the only black people I've seen on the streets  Not even a cop  Well, no surprise that Anthony took MLK Day off  Of course  Like, I got a case of disrespecting black people  He's making a statement today  Trust me  Oh, he'll say he was sick or something  But I got the call  I'm like, of course he's going to be sick today  Racist AIDS  He is being respectful  I think that we should be off today  It's a national holiday  And he's taking the day off in honor of Dr. James 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, yeah  We did try to take today off  So is he  Because it really is  He's disrespectful  Or you two are disrespectful  Honestly, I'll tell you  We wanted to take the day off  Because, you know, a day off is  Who doesn't want a day off?  I'd take off  Yeah, I would take off  And Stump Brain, what do they say?  I mean, this MLK, when it first started  Was sort of a holiday  But now it's pretty much a solid holiday  You look like an idiot  If you make your employees work today  Yeah, and a lot of companies give you the choice  Of MLK Day or President's Day  Yeah  And we had just come back from a vacation 
[00:24:30]  So they said  Why don't you wait a month?  Yeah, so now they're saying  Why don't you take your President's Day off instead?  When is that?  In February sometime  February 16th  Yeah  Mark that one down  Oh, right around Valentine's Day  Yes, sir  Can we take the long weekend?  Yes, sir  Around Valentine's  All right, I could do that  So I just want to say  I, you know, I wanted to acknowledge the MLK thing today  All right, on behalf of all black people, thank you  Hey, man  I don't know what that means  I'm getting swept up in the whole freaking Obama thing 
[00:25:00]  I'm loving it  I watched the TV all weekend long  What's your problem with it?  Nothing  Just waiting  Waiting for the what?  Just waiting to see what happens  For his first F up?  No, I'm, you know  Yeah, that's what I guess I am  I'm so cynical  I'm on the first line of defense team  I'm not even rooting for him  I'm just doing all my planning for when white people  I wonder  I wonder if he understands that  It's never going to be better than it is right now for him  Like, he can't do no wrong for the most part 
[00:25:30]  But that first  That first time he messes up  He's going to go, oh, wow  And he'll watch that popularity, you know, dip a bit  But right now  They freaking love this guy  You know  Without a doubt  More stimulus  How come stimulus  How come bailing out a car company is like democracy  And bailing out people is communism?  Socialism  Why is that?  That's a very good question  Why is bailing out?  I mean, you should see the people in line to get money  Like, not even just car companies 
[00:26:00]  Like, bagel companies  Oh, yeah  People, just anybody going out of business  Well, recently  A couple people from the porn industry  Larry Flint  Larry Flint and the Girls Gone Wild, dude  Was it?  It was, right?  And I wish that porn is not  Bo Bicey  What?  That's not  Who's this guy?  One of our very old interns  We're desperate for interns  One of our interns is 38  That guy can't be  How old are you?  29, 28  28  28, so  He's one of the younger interns we have 
[00:26:30]  What's going on here?  I haven't been here for a couple of weeks  Or months  Or whatever it is  Look, here he is  He loves Carol O'Connor  Oh, he's  Oh, you know  I thought this guy  He's 38  I thought he was  I thought that was the guy  That did the machine  I just glanced  Glanced at him  I thought  Yeah, for a second  And it's not  Oh, really?  Are people mistaking you for Tim?  No  Oh, really?  He could probably do a better song parody than he does  Unbelievable  Well, good morning, sir  Thank you, sir  I'm glad you got all ready to talk 
[00:27:00]  Where no one really  Nobody cares, yeah  He bolted right  It could be the worst shirt in North America  A little round man just trying to get a break  He's married  He quit his job to get into radio  At the worst time to get into radio  Yeah  Like the whole business is collapsing  The radio websites have just lists of people that are out of work  Just begging to be hired by anybody  30-year veterans  And this guy decided, you know, this is the perfect time to try to make something of myself in the radio 
[00:27:30]  He has diabetes to look forward to  Just 5'2  5'4", 5'5", 267 pounds of pure hell  You're 5'5", 220?  5'6", 5'6", 5'6", 2'5",  That means you're 5'5", who are you kidding?  5'4", 12  My wife tells me every day how fat I am  So I guess I'll stop my wife  Oh, okay  Yeah  Sully!  Sully!  Oh, that creepy pilot  I read about him all weekend long  And man, it's getting more and more impressive what he accomplished last week 
[00:28:00]  I would have been  I would have crashed right into the GWB  Well, we're not pilots  I wouldn't have done well  I would have crashed taking off  I'm not a pilot  I'm just thinking  I would have just drove straight into something  No, it's like  You know how we talk about  And then he has the guns and stuff  And you and I both agree  That we can't be gun owners  Because we would do something irresponsible  Like we'd shoot our foot or our leg or something  Just kind of trying to clean the damn thing  I was thinking  Alright, if I had the skills to be a pilot 
[00:28:30]  Now I'm in that situation  I would be like  I would be panic guy  Right into the GWB  Old men are the only people I want to see fly my planes  It's just  He's been in some type  He's been shot down three times  And he's gone through something  Where he had to land in the jungle  And do all kind of crazy stuff  And this guy  I mean  That's why  And I go  Where do you learn how to fly  If you're under 60?  Like who's flying these planes  And that dude  And he looks like he drinks too  Oh yeah  So I mean  I don't know if he drinks 
[00:29:00]  But he looks like he drinks  Of course he must  To keep  Look at the horror  And this is the thing  We're not embracing  Is how much horror  We are anyway  When the flight is  Not anything happening  But immediately something's happening  And you see the engine  And then if you're sitting on the left hand side  Near the engine  I'm always looking at the engine  I see a giant goose  Just flying  Oh my god  And you know something's wrong  They said they could smell the birds burning  They smelled the flesh of the birds  In the cockpit  Sully's saying 
[00:29:30]  Yeah we knew right away  We hit a flock of something  And you could smell them burning  Just holding someone's hand  Next to you  That you don't like  But you start praying  Because you're all going to die  And this guy pulls you  You see the river coming  And then you open your eyes  And you're not dead  How can you say anything  But something special  About this old man  He was so on top of it  The transcripts came out  Saturday or Sunday  He announces what happened  Lost both engines  They're like Newark  He goes no  Then he goes  What's that airport 
[00:30:00]  Teterboro  He goes nope  Going river  Like it was like boom boom boom  He knew  That nope  The only chance he got is river  And then  When he  When I saw where he landed  In the river  Because that's where Jimmy and I  In separate buildings  But we live on that side  I'm like that guy  I knew the river  Because if he landed it  Anywhere north of where he did  People would have died of hypothermia  Because it only takes a mere four or five minutes in the water  You're dead  I was talking to my brother last night  So he died  Four or five minutes in that water  He landed in a warmer spot 
[00:30:30]  I'll tell you where he landed  He landed where the ferries go back and forth all day long  So the guy goes  I know where the ferry traffic is  And that will give me an even better chance of saving some of these people  What if he killed some  What if he landed on a ferry  Then we wouldn't be talking about what a hazy is  But I think he saw  You know  As he was deciding where to  You know  Touch down  That the ferries at that point  Lucky enough  Were on both sides  Getting ready to go back across the river 
[00:31:00]  He probably would have landed a little shorter  Is what I'm saying  If he saw the ferries were actually in the water still  He had it figured out  He had to be on that plane  And living  It's like  Come on man  He was 10 feet from Newark airport  What's wrong  He played  Why did they say he didn't do it though  He was probably wanted in Jersey  On some sexual assault  Charges  And he wanted to get off in Newark  Dude he lost  He lost everything so quick  That thing was  He would have probably hit your  Where you  You live  In the way  He could have hit you  God bless that dude  He could have hit you 
[00:31:30]  People  People are happy about that dude  Did you see the interviews  He didn't exactly save a bunch of scientists  No  No kidding  Well the flight was going from  Where to North Carolina  LaGuardia to North Carolina  I mean  No disrespect  If any  If any flight's gonna go  If any plane full of people  Were expendable  Oh man  It wasn't going to Washington  Or somewhere smart  Yeah  It was going to North Carolina  These were not Yale students  Flying to Connecticut  Right  But it was a real plane too  That's the thing I always ask  Because I refuse to get on 
[00:32:00]  The Buddy Hollies  Even though they all go down  Yeah  I just won't get on the Buddy Hollies  If I gotta take a Buddy Hollies  I take a cab first  With the propeller  Oh yeah  That always makes me nervous  When I'll say  That was a real plane  Going to North Carolina man  You think you're on a real plane  And you look out  And go  Oh propellers  Great  I had enough of Sully  Monday morning quarterbacking though  I kind of suspected  There was ferry traffic  And we knew that geese would be flying  So we told  Shut up Sully  You didn't know  This guy?  Yeah  Monday morning 
[00:32:30]  Yeah  Oh I knew there was ferry traffic  No you didn't  Jim  He landed an airplane  He's a bum  Exactly  He landed  Not only did he land the plane  He crashed into the water  He's a bum  He landed the plane  Besides that  No one dies  When the air temperature is 20  Not counting the wind chill  Which made it a little worse  And then the water temperature  Some said 40  But they're saying  It was closer to 30  This is the first time  I think I've ever heard  A plane crash  Where people lived  And do you know 
[00:33:00]  Who told me  This friend of mine  He was in some armed forces  He said  Do you know why  Do people tuck their heads  In between their legs  When there's that whole thing  So they can recover your body  So you can break your neck  When the plane  Right  Make it easy for you  Just to put out your misery  Right  And this is the first time  That's ever like  Actually worked  Where people are alive  You know  The stewardess is telling them  Tuck their heads in there  And this is what's gonna happen  And they lived  Now they don't want you  To break your neck  The reason they do this  Probably so your head  Doesn't snap back  When you land 
[00:33:30]  If you jerk when you land  Or something  They don't want you  Sitting up  And then your head  Snapping back  And then breaking it  That's probably what's  To prevent you  From breaking your neck  Imagine that  To what?  Prevent you from  If you're sitting up  And you hit really hard landing  They're probably afraid  That everybody  Your neck would snap back  Or your face would smack  That's just to kind of  Keep you as tight as possible  Yeah  Break your neck when you land  Imagine  From a 30,000 foot drop  Oh 30,000 foot  Imagine Sully makes this  Amazing water landing  All excited  He goes into  To see how the people  Are doing  And they're all  Just sitting there  Paralyzed  Come on  Get up 
[00:34:00]  Dude  They all just  Break their neck  I was just thinking  About how much  I don't like flying  And this dude  Getting me alive  Can I tell you something  I said it  Last week  Whatever  But my girl  Saw the crash  From our apartment  She looked at it  She saw it  She saw the crash  And she and a bunch  Of other people  In my apartment  They were panicky  And they couldn't  Get it on video  We would have had  The video  She saw it  She saw it  For at least  30 to 45 seconds 
[00:34:30]  Over the river  And knew it was  Going to crash  Got on the phone  With 911  Was on  With 911  When it crashed  Jesus  Just amazing  What is the proof  There is proof  Actually  But  You got taped  Of everything else  Let's hear this  She was the frantic  911 call  Oh my god  The plane  She was that  Are you serious  Swear to god  She was the frantic  911 caller  Oh my god  What a few you have  And then her brother  Kind of reckoned  The call a little bit  Because he goes  Holy 
[00:35:00]  Boop  And that's how  It was presented  Are you serious  Yes  And I missed it  By 15 minutes  I went to the gym  It was  Where Jimmy and I live  It was 10 blocks away  You should see what  I was doing  While it happened  Required a little  Clean up  When finished  And I will say this  If Sully was so good  How about this  Don't hit the geese  Stupid  How about that  When you see geese  Fly around them  Fly around the geese  Don't aim for the geese  Big shot  Was it on takeoff  It had to be on takeoff  Oh yeah  Right away  He probably was bored 
[00:35:30]  After 40 years  Saw the flock of geese  And said this is a nice  Challenge  This is the challenge  I was looking for  This is the retirement  Party I wanted  I'm going to get  All this money  And accolades  Right before I'm done  And the paper today  The headline  Florida man  Thanks lucky stars  He missed flight  And I was telling  Stunt brain  And he's shown his ticket  He was supposed to be  On that flight  Right  And I'm telling  Stunt brain  Why is he thanking  His lucky stars  No one died  If you now know  No one died  Wouldn't you want  To be on that flight 
[00:36:00]  You'd have a story  To tell for the rest  Of your life  But on that flight  But he's saying  After the fact  Thank god I wasn't  On that plane  Why thank god  Everyone survived  A few people got  Their tootsies cold  That was it  Have they been  Interviewing people  On the plane  I mean that plane  Must have stunk  Of scaredness  You know what I mean  No kidding  Just in your drawers  Everybody  No kidding man  Can you imagine  No kidding  Damn  So  Pretty amazing stuff  I'm looking at the photos  Now and  Looking at all  I knew he would 
[00:36:30]  Get invited  I knew  That's what I said  This pilot  He got invited  To the Obama festival  You knew  That he would get  Sure  One day you're going  To take off  And the next day  Ten minutes later  The president of the United States  Knows who you are  This might be a set up  This might be an elaborate  Assassination attempt  You can't have  Sully's walking around  Yeah I don't  No we can't have that  He can't get close  To the president  This might be  We were imagining that  Everyone's like  Rah Rah Sully  And he's just an awful  Human being  When he's a flying plane  He pretended to crash  He knew what he was going to do 
[00:37:00]  All the people on the plane  Were operatives  They knew that  Someone on that plane  To get invited  To the inauguration  I'm sure  I don't like this  I'm sure the conspiracy  Theorists out there  Are already spitting this  Like look  We need a feel good story  So they set this whole  Sully thing up  Something's wrong  I'm just going to add  To the paranoia  Of the inauguration security  Because I know  They've been sitting  Around in the room  Just imagining  All the different ways  And they just go  Hey listen  No matter what you think 
[00:37:30]  No matter how paranoid  It sounds  Just throw your two cents in  What do you think  Well maybe  Aliens  Are going to fly  From another place  And drop  You know  Ticks on  And then they got  The alien tick team  Ready to go  Because they cannot be  The people  Who lose  The first black president  They can't be  What are they calling  His car  The monster  Or something  No  There's a nickname  For his limo  It is like

[00:42:00]  To some better guy now  Yeah  And he's just  Kind of relaxing  His daughter  Gets kidnapped  In an apartment  Her and a friend  And it's not  An elaborate  Thing you gotta follow  It's just a dude  Right  Who's looking for  His kidnapped daughter  Some Albanian  Prostitution ring  Just some badass  That's it  It's  That's all it is  And he is  And movies like this  Which I love  Are like  Game of death  Or video game movies  Where there's levels 
[00:42:30]  Like you find  You know  Sort of bad guy  Right  Then you find  Badder guy  Then you find  It's like that  And he just keeps  Finding who he needs to find  Until he gets his daughter  And it's  Up the ladder  It's not  It's just about him  Finding his daughter  It is a  Bad movie  And I mean good  As far as  Previews go  The preview for that movie  Dude  Wow  I'm like  I gotta see this one  It's one of the best  Movies like that  Only movie that  Comes close  Is Payback 
[00:43:00]  With Mel Gibson  Yeah  Just the way it is  It's just relentless  There's a scene in Taken  That's so good  That even if the movie  Was bad  It would have put  The movie as good  Okay  If this  It is just  A great movie  I don't even know  If Liam Neeson acts  Because  He kind of lives  Around us  And I see him  Every once in a while  And you don't want  To say hi to the guy  He is that guy  When he's just  Walking the streets  Some of these guys  I don't think  They're real actors 
[00:43:30]  I think they're just  Like being themselves  In these movies  Alec Baldwin is too  Alec Baldwin  You just see him  Catching a cab  By himself  Yeah  No fear  Yeah  What up buddy  Yeah  I love that guy  I love Alec Baldwin  I love that 30 rock  He's that dude  Like in the streets  And Liam is that  But Liam is like  Some crazy mick  Or something man  He don't play games  He doesn't mess around  What so ever  What so ever  I should say  I saw Step Brothers  Finally  Oh that looked like you  I saw a scene  Where Will Ferrell  And John C. Reilly 
[00:44:00]  We're playing like  The big guys  Like kids at heart  You know  It was really funny  I love Will Ferrell  And a bunch of people  Said this Step Brothers movie  Because I'm looking  For a good comedy  They go  You gotta check out  Step Brothers  It's a funny movie  That was rough  Some of the scenes  Were kind of funny  But the parents  Playing into the fact  That they're 40 year olds  Acting like 12 year olds  Took me out of the movie  I'm like  Oh my god  Stop already  It's crap  I know it's a movie  And you're supposed  To kind of just go with it  But it was  Like at one 
[00:44:30]  At one point  The father's giving  A 40 year old  A spanking  Because he misbehaved  I'm like  I didn't see that part  Oh my god  There you go  It was  It was  It was rough man  It was Will Ferrell  And John C. Reilly  Which one was getting  This  Come on  Which one  You know  I don't know  Because they were  Interchangeable after a while  Because they were the same guy  That's how they  Related to each other  Those two are nuts  Oh it was rough  There was a few good scenes  But I don't know  There are some movies  Where you just won't 
[00:45:00]  You just go  I'm not gonna see this  Were you the one  That turned me on  To the Adam Sandler movie  The last time you were in here  Zohan  Zohan made me laugh  I freaking like  That stupid movie  Zohan  And because  On your recommendation  I checked that one out  And I was like  Wow  Patrice was right  You know  Because I went in  And I'm kinda  I'm already going  Like halfway  Like Adam Sandler  I haven't been  An Adam Sandler fan  In a while  You turned me on  To this movie  I go home  I watch them  I go right on Patrice  I wanted to see  Sin City  And forgot it came out 
[00:45:30]  On Christmas  You know that movie  Made six million dollars  Or something  Not even ten  It didn't do well  It was a bomb  At the box office  Not Sin City  The Spirit  Sorry  What is The Spirit  Oh  Wow  Who's in it  You didn't even hear about it  Sam Jackson plays the villain  The Spirit  It's one of those  Awful Sam Jackson movies  Those looking  You know those movies  That everybody does a comic book  Like 300  What do they call those  Those things 
[00:46:00]  When they do an adaptation  Of a comic book  That looks kinda  A Frank Miller  It's like a Frank Miller  Okay  You didn't even hear  Oh  That's what I meant  Not Sin City  I take that back  The Spirit  You know like The Wrestler  I just can't even  Bring myself to  Want to see it  Benjamin Brat  Or whatever the thing is  No no no  The Wrestler  Let's slow down a little bit  The Wrestler  I really really enjoy  I know it's probably good  I mean you gotta understand  But you gotta understand  It's a low budget  Indie type film  You're not  You know  You're not getting  The big Hollywood 
[00:46:30]  It brought Mickey Rourke back  And I'm glad  I don't  When people say  This is his big comeback movie  I'm like really  What roles is he gonna get  When John Travolta came back  You could fit him into  A bunch of different  You know roles  This guy  What is he gonna play  He's gonna play  A bunch of  A bunch of bums  A bunch of people  That got stung by bees  A muscular trait  It was creepy  There's plenty of evil roles  Like that man  He's been messing up  His face for 10-15 years  So he was perfect  For the wrestler  If he wins an Oscar  Let me tell you  What an Oscar does  For you fantastic  It keeps you in the game 
[00:47:00]  For like 10 years  10 years  Easy  And you talk about  Sam Jackson  It kept  The other day  I was sitting with my girl  And I realized  I said  Oh my god  And I didn't want to say it  Because I love Sam Jackson  Yeah  I go  Sam hasn't done a good movie  Since Pulp Fiction  Come on  That's crazy  Since  Him or John Travolta  There's gotta be one in there  For Sam Jackson  Since Pulp Fiction  Alright we're gonna  Danny look that up  There's gotta be one 
[00:47:30]  He was great in Pulp Fiction  Dude I couldn't watch the movie  Without him being  Without  If Sam Jackson was not  In Pulp Fiction  I don't  I only watch the movie  When Sam Jackson's in the movie  Although Walken's scene was great  Christopher Walken had a great  The watch scene  Yeah it was good  Yeah  But yeah  What else did Sam Jackson done  He was great in that  I'm looking with Danny right now  Jungle fever  Black Snake Moan  That was terrible  Snakes on a  Black Snake  That Black Snake Moan stunk  I know  It was a corny racial message 
[00:48:00]  And  Well he was in Star Wars of course  Revenge of the Sith  Jungle fever I think was the best role he ever did  That's my favorite thing  You know what  Patrice is not that far off  As we look at  It just hasn't been  The man with that stupid Eugene Levy  Dude  Yeah  Just  But let's be honest though  He was  Unbreakable  I liked Unbreakable  Could have been better  But I liked him in that  I'm always for a guy  That's been  That's been a soldier in the game a while  Being able to enjoy his money 
[00:48:30]  And he was  He was  He was working hard  And then he hit with Pulp Fiction  But since that  That's a good  I can't think of anything  I would  He stays in the game though  You also mentioned  I think you wanted to say  The Curious Life of  Benjamin  Button  Benjamin Button  It's just like  Who saw it over the weekend?  Stump Brain didn't like it  Come on dude  Like I don't  It was a little slow  It's a long movie  I mean I'm being biased  You know what I mean?  I think they did the movie in real time  I'm gonna wait to see Notorious 
[00:49:00]  I wanna see Notorious  I wanna wait to see that a little bit  When it all  I'm gonna go to a nice  11 o'clock matinee  Did you see  On a Tuesday  It's perfect  Did you see  WALL-E  No  And I heard it was supposed to be good  People are saying  One of the best movies of the year  I'm a big animation fan  I was like  That's what I heard  It could have been way better  Bolt was supposed to be good  I heard Bolt  Yeah  And all that  But I just  I saw  Horton Hears a Who 
[00:49:30]  Actually really really good  Animated film  Are you serious?  Jim Carrey  The voice of the elephant  I hate animation  I never enjoy it  I enjoy it  Are you serious?  Yeah I liked it  I thought I wasn't gonna like it  But I liked it  Yeah  Horton Hears a Who  Well I watched  On Jet X  What's Jet X?  Jet X  Jet X  All these kids  These kids stations that pop up  Uh huh  Showed an old  Fantastic Four  Cartoon Marathon 
[00:50:00]  Nice  Fantastic  Little X-Men  You're not into that stuff  I used to love comic books  Then I stopped  Oh wait a minute  I tell you why  What movie  I popped out  I was trying to think of what movie  Made me want to have a conversation with Sam Jackson  I just watched Jumper  Oh I heard that was a piece of crap  Where he dyed his hair just completely like  Just completely  Like white  I wouldn't even know  And that kid who  I'm gonna vote as one of the worst actors  Since Christopher Lambert 
[00:50:30]  Who  I forgot his name  I know  The kid who destroyed  Single handedly destroyed  George Lucas' reputation  Right  Who made me go  George Lucas  What the hell's his name?  Not McGregor  His name is Hayden Christensen  Right right right right  I'm telling you  And I hope  You know  Look  I'm giving up on the idea  That I'm gonna be  Like in these movies  With these people  That kid  Is devoid  It has to be something  Where somebody was attracted to him 
[00:51:00]  That he is in  Not as  Not as stratospheric  In his badness  As Keanu Reeves  And Christopher Lambert  Two of the  Most unforgivably  Bad actors  I'm serious man  Keanu Reeves  I watched that  When the Earth stood still  Dude  I could not  Believe  Arnold Schwarzen  And the Terminator  Had more  Emotional range  Yes  Than  Keanu Reeves  In this movie 
[00:51:30]  I just could not  Believe how bad it was  Keanu Reeves was good  In Bill and Ted's  Excellent Adventure  Cause he was supposed  To just be that  Boob  And he was good  In Devil's Advocate  Aside from that  Everything he's done  Is terrible  Terrible  I can't understand  Was he really good  In Devil's Advocate  I liked him in that  I mean that movie  I liked him in that  That movie was  That one cry he did  For his girl  That was still good though  I mean that movie  The movie was good  The movie was amazing  I don't think you could  Do no wrong  If you have any part  In that movie  Right  He doesn't carry the movie  The movie carries him  If that makes sense 
[00:52:00]  It's one of those movies  I've never been impressed  By his stuff  Matrix loved the movies  But wasn't impressed  With him  Impressed  He is  I'm telling you  I know  I'm with you  Let me tell you  One of the worst acted scenes  I've ever seen  It was in Speed  I'll never forget it  Oh god  I wasn't even a movie guy  When I saw Speed  And I watched it  And the girl's driving  What's her name  Sandra Bullock  Sandra Bullock  We're gonna now have to  Find this scene  If we can guys  She hits  What she thinks  Is a baby  Right  And she's going nuts  And trying to drive 
[00:52:30]  His bus at 50  During rush hour traffic  So that's one of the  And she hits  What she thinks  Is a baby  And he sees  It's just  A homeless woman  Pushing a thing  Full of cans  Yeah yeah  And he just goes  It's okay  It's just cons  It's cons  He said it like that  I'm telling you  I don't remember  It's  It's  It's  It's cons  Yeah  It's cons  We gotta find that  It's shockingly bad  I'm telling you 
[00:53:00]  Other than  Other than  And I was gonna say  But she was only in one  In one thing  That is  Ultimately  What could have destroyed  An entire movie system  Was Francis Ford Coppola's kid  Acting in Godfather 3  You know when you're  You watch Godfather 3 though  It's not as bad  As you originally thought though  Because you forgave her  You think  You forgave  You  You  You  The movie itself  Is a lot better  Than you originally thought  Yes  Too man  Yes  A lot better  But we had a lot 
[00:53:30]  Of expectations  Man if  I guess if  Like he  Didn't hire her  That would have been  Just a massive classic  Winona Ryder  Was supposed to do it  I believe  But she was suffering  From exhaustion  From another film  I think she probably  Just didn't want to do it  And Robert Duvall  Purposely priced himself  Out of it  That's why he  Get some sleeping pills  And get your sleep together  I think she probably  Didn't want to do it  Had a chance of being  In a Godfather movie  Hey did you see  Seven Pounds  Somebody  That's another one  Rob of Long Island  Did you guys see Seven Pounds  I did not see that  Can't see it  Some people say  It was very good  Let's go to Malik 
[00:54:00]  In Asbury Park  Malik  Yo good morning fellas  What's good  What's up  Malik  Yeah  Hey yo Patrice man  I've seen that  Notorious movie man  How is it  I give it a  I give it a  Seven out of a  Ten man  It wasn't  How old are you though  We gotta go there though  How old are you  Cause I'm gonna tell you  Why I'm asking  After you tell me  I'm thirty  I'm thirty five  Son I knew big yo  You know what I'm saying  See that's what it is  Here's my problem  With the movie itself  It's  It's not time yet 
[00:54:30]  Because see  It doesn't count for us  Cause we lived it  It's nostalgic for us  You're thirty five  You was living it  I'm thirty nine  I was living the whole thing  So it's  It's too many emotions  Involved with the people  Who will see it  It should have came out  Maybe fifteen years from now  Really  When  When it's  Everybody's  It's kinda  It's even  You know what I mean  Because  I'm a big fan  I'm gonna see it  Just cause I was a big fan  But I know the story  I know how I was going to end 
[00:55:00]  I know how it began  It's too close  For that right now  So  He's thirty five  He knows  Like  Well Malik  Did you know  Or did you just meet him  Nah  I met him  Twice  You know what I'm saying  I run with a bunch of  Brownsville dudes  And shot him from Bed-Stuy  So  You know what I'm saying  Like my people  Knew his people  So I met him  Like right when he first got on  When he came out  With the song  Party and BS  You know what I'm saying  Like I met  Sonny Coney Allen  And he was a live dude  Like he was a real cool dude 
[00:55:30]  But  See when you said  Party and  Party and BS  A collection of  Tin white eyebrows  Wiggled like  Hmm  I don't even know that song  That's his first song  That he came out with  But that wasn't his hit  Yeah  Party and BS  But  Did you ever hear the song  Notorious  Which one  That's the only  Biggest song I know  Hey  Hey listen  Let me ask you a question  When you saw it right  What was  What  Do you wish  Was better portrayed  In the movie  What did they  What did they really get right 
[00:56:00]  And what did they really get wrong  I think  I think  See I think the whole  The whole thing of the movie was  It was told through like  Mrs. Wiles' eyes  You know what I'm saying  And she knew like  What kind of person  Her son was  You know what I mean  But the reality  Like one part I didn't like  About the movie is  It painted big  Like some big  Drug dealer  Like you know what I'm saying  Like he was getting it like that  You know in the reality  More than half  These drug dealers  That talk about  They was kingpins  They lied dude  They was  They was nickel and dime hustlers  Like the average person 
[00:56:30]  Trying to make it in the game  He wasn't making money like that  You know what I'm saying  And if he was  Why ended it rap game  It wasn't that serious  Well you gotta  You gotta pump up  You gotta pump up the story  No matter what  That's what Hollywood does  You take a little truth  And really  Huh  Yeah but the way  They did an opus  Like they did it like  They did it too  Extravagantly  Like you wanna tell a life  About that man  They tell a life  Oh they tried to  They tried to say  He was like  He was like  Like Scarface in the movie  Before he started doing rap  Right right  Yeah  Yeah kind of  Like he started off 
[00:57:00]  Like his man put him on  He was nickel and dime  And then before the time  He knew it  He was  He was supplying other  Come on man  Let's get real  You know what though  You shouldn't be surprised by that  Of course Hollywood's gonna  Pump it up like that  It makes him a much better  Movie to watch  I guess  What is it  Creative license  Whatever they call it  Well who shot him  Yeah how do they  Handle that  They don't  How they handle that  Malik  I guarantee it was like  Oh let me  I'll tell you what it was  I didn't even see it  It was probably a guy  It's a silhouette  They know the car  Silhouette  Very mysterious 
[00:57:30]  There was a gun came out  And they handled the gun  Yeah but it wasn't  I bet they don't even  Show the shooting  I bet the hand comes out  And they just  They go somewhere else  You know Malik  They didn't even show  They showed it like  When the  When that part came about  They like showed the car  Like you hear the voice  Probably slow motion  You know what it is  You know what it is  And then you just heard  The pop pop pop  And that was it  And you see him look at  You see him turn and look at  Who he thought it was  That was shooting him  You know what I'm saying  But they didn't like  Oh snap  Give me a little glimpse  They kind of give you  Indication of 
[00:58:00]  Who kind of like  Perpetuated it  You know what I'm saying  Y'all know where that go  The west coast thing  They kind of give you like a  Like an idea  Of kind of who perpetuated it  But then again  This is Miss Wallace's story  That was told from Al  She seen it  Now I'm pretty sure  If you had like  Seize  Or D-Rock  Or Gutter  Or any of them  Tell a story  It would be a whole lot  More grime here  And a whole lot more  Different  Did the kid who played  Biggie do a good job  Yeah Gravy did his thing  Yeah Gravy did his thing 
[00:58:30]  He looks like him  That's for sure  Scary  The chick that played Faith  Oh man  She was scary  Of how point  How point she was  Man  Oh man  Alright listen  They didn't really get  Into the story  About even little Kim  Neither  You know what I'm saying  And she played a big role  Right  It just like  Went over  But I'd give it a  7, 6, 7  Out of a 10  I'm going to go see that  Next Tuesday  About 9 in the morning  That's a perfect time  Give me a call  I'll go with you  You did your thing too

[01:00:00]  I put people onto the hood  To own it all the time  You know what I'm saying  They look at me like  Yo you crazy kid  You know what I mean  Well Patrice  No you're not crazy  Because Patrice said it a while ago  He goes black people  Want to like this radio show  They want to listen  And they want to like it  But it's just  But they're in hiding  There's a lot of  There's a lot of hidden black fans  They can't admit it  I think I understand  It's underground  It's underground black fans  Of the show  And it ain't just crazy dude  It's just  It's people that go  Oh man it's funny  But they go  Okay  Yeah  You know 
[01:00:30]  I'm always shocked  Like a black cab driver  Because a lot of cab drivers  Listen to us  And if a black cabbie goes  Hey man I listen to this show  I'm always like really  I know  Is it an accent  Right  Seriously man  It's like  A lot of people  A lot of brothers in the hood  Support your show  I just know that  When you guys have events  Like the virus show  Y'all don't come out  And I know  That was like the only brother  Me and my man  Was the only brother  Up in there  All right Malik  It was crazy  All right Malik  We're going to get back  Into the white world  After the break  Malik from Asbury Park  That was  Was that a special 
[01:01:00]  Martin  I'm trying  They're making it hard  No we're not at all  It's very easy today  I'm putting up a black fist  Right now for Asbury  I have to  Yo  Yo  Oh don't do that to me  Oh he got you  No  There you go  There you go  Good one Malik  You know how bad  Good one Malik  You know how bad  I want to be loved  Come on Malik  Why do that to me  And let me tell you something  I got to always be in tune  And I'm like  Malik's on the phone 
[01:01:30]  I'm like  All right right now  It's all right  And then I'm like  Dipping too far  Into the black culture here  There is  I guarantee on this screen  Right here  That you look at  There are about 50  Emails going  If that had been a white guy  You would have hung up on him  No I like Malik a lot  12 minutes ago  No I like listening to him  He's a regular  He calls us all  Yeah Malik's calling all the time  I like his little angle on things  So  Patrice and Neil in studio  Jim Norton of course  No Anthony  We continue in just a bit 
[01:02:00]  Talk a little football  And then we got the specs  On Obama's presidential limousine  You think Anthony's home  With a replica of a balcony  And he just put a couple of  Different  A couple of different cut out boards  And it's down in his basement  He was pushing for James Earl Ray's birthday  At the holiday  AOP and Anthony show  Go  Go 
[01:02:30]  Go  Go  Go  Go  I'm with you Patrice  Happy MLK day  Worst lyricist ever  50 cent  Never  Yeah bad  In a club  Drink a bottle of bub  Stop it  Come give me a hug  I'll drink a bottle of bub  I'm in a club  Are ya  Hey you know  He says it eight times  I can't even argue with you  I don't like to do drugs  I can't even argue with you 
[01:03:00]  Why the mispronunciation  In some of these songs Patrice  I'm trying to understand that  What is that all about  I'm anti  Like there was that song  It's a bit old now  Where he goes  In the air  Air  Air  Why can't he say just  In the air  In the air  To try to be  In the air  Not white  They do it to bug us  Like say  Scrimp  I'm telling you  It really is a battle  For us to not be white  We gotta figure out  Everything we can do 
[01:03:30]  To not be white  That drives me nuts though  But it's kinda catchy  In the air  Air  This is cool though  When he goes  It's your birthday  He said mean  You know what  When this song was out  It was kind of a guilty pleasure  I would crank this one up  I don't know  Hey by the way  Coke Logic  Making me feel a little better  He goes  Oh Malik didn't hang up on you  His phone card ran out  So that makes me feel  Oh  Oh  A little better today  Thank you  Coke Logic  Coke Logic is always there for me 
[01:04:00]  877-212-ON-A  Lots going on  But we started this  I just want to finish up  On the Obama vehicle  They do call it the Beast  Right  Some of the safety  And high tech features  Include  8 inch thick  Armor plated doors  Each weighing the same  As a cabin door  On a Boeing 757  Which copy do you have?  I got this  This crappy copy  That  I know  I yelled at those guys  That doesn't tell you  No of course not  An independent oxygen supply  An advanced firefighting system  Located in the boot 
[01:04:30]  Pump action shotguns  Night vision cameras  And tear gas cannons  To keep  Obama's own person  To keep our president alive  While the citizens are dying around him  Right  With the poison attack  Right  Obama's  It gets better  Obama's own personal storage of blood  Kevlar reinforced tires  That are puncture and shred resistant  And special steel wheels  That could drive without the tire attached  Norton was you talking about it  Was it this show talking about  All the stuff they have to do 
[01:05:00]  Like when the president travels  He has to go to the bathroom  And he can't go to the bathroom  Like in the public  Toilets or the hotels or something  Someone has to collect his  Get out of here  Yeah  Somebody has to collect it  Alright I gotta find that out  So that they don't  They don't devise any kind of  His body weaknesses  And study him  And all that  To devise something that could be  They can make to be harmful  His waste has to be collected  Yeah  I wonder who gets that job  That's what I was  They have to collect his waste 
[01:05:30]  That's the low guy  In the secret service totem pole  So do I get to guard the president  Not exactly  Yeah  You carry a bag  That nobody wants to shoot at  Also five inch thick  Bulletproof glass  He has to have it  Amazing  I wonder if Bush's was  There it is right there  Wow  Yeah  The beast  Called the beast  Jesus  But let me ask you  He probably has the biggest  Security in the history  He does  Every president  That ever lived  And of course he does  Good God  But wait 
[01:06:00]  So they have to collect his waste  Where does he go to the bathroom  I think on the plane  On the Air Force One  And all that stuff  But you gotta go  When you're on transit  You're going to do a lunch  Or a dinner  And they're serving  Maybe  Maybe it is  A presidential bag holder  Come on  Do a little research  I want to know more about this  It'd be great  If like the secret service guy  Has to kind of be  Like maybe he has a bag  He has a bag  That he has to stay  Because you know  He had to turn in his blackberry  But I guess  Oh now he's saying  He doesn't want to do it  Right  He said look 
[01:06:30]  So  So we're going to get  Some really cool emails  That are going to be  Available to the public  When he's just  You know  Doing lovey-dovey stuff  With his wife and kids  Dude  Because anything he types  You know  Is public record right  Maybe he has like  Presidential bags  That he has to  In any toilet  He has to go  He has to be responsible  For putting that bag down  And go  And put it like  Like where the toilet is  And hook it up  So it's like something  That he takes a regular dump  But it's 
[01:07:00]  How embarrassing  For the president  Yeah  But it makes sense though  That somebody can take  His mess  In one of these countries  And you know  Do something  With his doo-doo  I don't know  Just get rid of it  Just flush it  Who's down there  Collecting that  Well you saw  American Me  That's how they got  The drugs in  They unscrewed  And they just  I didn't see that  Catch his presidential dump  But the thing is this  They have guys  That check everything out  In the secret service  That check  Make sure there's no bombs  They can't make sure  There's not a guy down there  With a screwdriver  And a clamp bag  How do you sneak 
[01:07:30]  How do you sneak  Through the crowd  With that  I don't know  I don't know  I mean  He stays in all these hotels  And the president  Dude  This is  You can't find anything  I can't see anything  Yeah  Patrice shut up  I'm telling you  You're out of your mind  If someone can find that  Please send it  Why would I make that up  I think I heard it on this show  I think we talked about it  Hey  What do you think of this quote  This is the big quote  I wish Anthony was here  Because this would send him  Over the edge  It's on the front page  Of a bunch of the newspapers  Rosa Parks sat 
[01:08:00]  So Martin Luther King  Could walk  Okay  Martin Luther King walked  So Obama could run  Okay  Obama ran  So we could all fly  That disgusts me too  But I'm going to have to  Act like it's  It does in a way right  It's special  Why does it disgust you  It just  It's just  It stinks  It's trying a little too hard  Yeah  Anybody who's like  A real human being  Can't get excited  About some of that nonsense  That's just  It's just nonsense  I like it up to the fly part  First couple lines  Were all right 
[01:08:30]  Good  And then it's like  All right  Shut up  My thing is  I hope he does well  For the whole country  But as a black person  You want him to do  A little bit  More for us  You just want to feel  Like there's something  Out there  With a little bit of  Wink for  Hey here you go  Black people  But I want the whole  Country to be right  You know what I mean  Because out in the streets  It's bad  All you hear is bad stuff  Just people talking bad  Talking about  You know  Robbing and stealing  And dying  A lot of bad  Conversations  Just happening  In general  If he makes the country  Better I'm in  Simple as that  That's what I'm hoping  He does  I'm hoping he does 
[01:09:00]  The right thing  I'm not a big  Political guy  But if he fixes  A few things  And make this  A better place to live  I'm sure  And worse come to worse  Make it better for me  Well that's your thing  You know  You're fine though  You do just fine  Oh Jesus  It's getting bad  You do just fine  Oh man  I want to show you guys  People taking pay cuts  I want to show you guys  A picture  Got to thank  WWTDD.com  When I give these guys  Plugs  It's rough  But it's  WhatWouldTylerDurdenDo.com  Also known as 
[01:09:30]  WWTDD.com  You got to give me  The uncensored  Are you ready for it  Well I think  They were the first  And now it's spreading  Around the internet  But they have a picture  Of Madonna  Don't go there yet  There Danny  Please  I guess it was a picture  She did  She did some kind  Of nude modeling  I think she got  Like $25  To do this  Or something  Back in the late  70s  Or early 80s  I saw that  And didn't even  Go to look at it  I saw that  I saw Madonna already  Does it look hot  Right now  Yes  What we're seeing 
[01:10:00]  Is a very young  Madonna  Dark dark black hair  Her little hair  Under her armpits  Got the censored barb  Across her boobies  And you don't see  What's going on  Below the belly button  Okay  Are you ready  Alright  And I want your  Natural reaction  When you see this  Okay  Hit it Danny  Boo  Boo  You need to show that  To a child  To get a raise  I don't know  It's just like  Boo  How do you describe that

[01:11:00]  She has hair under her arms  And yes you can see the laugh  Her legs are spread  But you can see like  Part of her calf  She has a hairy leg calf  Yeah  Or a calf  But let's be honest  There's something  Completely filthy  And nice about that  Not leg hair  No  Underarm hair  I can deal with a little bit  No  Specifically Madonna  That's awful  Being that despicable  Like even as a young mess  I can understand like  And her desperation  And she made it  That's what's great about Madonna  You can just see how desperate 
[01:11:30]  She was to be famous  And she is a role model  For any girl  Who just desperately wants fame  Danny how much you get  For that picture  Is it true  $25  $25 for that  $25 in 1978  Now she's like  A hundred millionaire  Something like that  She's pushing  She's pushing toward a billionaire  And back a mere 25 years  Or so ago  She spent  $25  $25 for that shot  What an unkempt mess  It's discussed  Oh she don't care  I can understand  What's going on above  But I don't understand 
[01:12:00]  What's going on  On the sides  Like it is like  I wish we were at  The other joint right now  To describe this  Yeah but it's  That's what  That's what happened  When you  If you let your hair  Grow out of control  If there was  There wasn't even  Lining it up back then  It was just  That's what I'm saying  Pure  It grew  It all started with  One woman out there  Going you know what  I'm going to line this up  A little bit better  Let me tell you  And then it advanced  To what we see today  Which is pretty much  Nothing  When I went to the public pool  When I was a kid  You know 10, 11  The whole thing of the day 
[01:12:30]  Was to see  An older girl  With the bush  Coming out the sides  Of the bathing suit  Right  That was the whole  That was the  That's what excited us  During the day  10, 11  And you see the  Like the 15, 16 year old girls  And they all  They would have that  That mess coming out the sides  It was  It looked like  It was amazing  It looked like  She was making  Jiffy Pop popcorn  In her bathing suit bottoms  Dude it was  That was what it was  Back then  So back then  This is not a 
[01:13:00]  Bad picture man  That's how it was  Back then  That's how it was  You kind of forget though man  I gotta give it to her  We've come a long way  From that look  And it's  Thank God we have  That's rough  My brother is a big fan  Of that though  Big fan  It's something  Brother Elmo  On MySpace  You could send him  A little message right now  He's a big fan of that  Huge fan  I am too  Sometimes you go back and forth  Sometimes you  You like to go old school  Yeah sometimes you just don't like it  Looking like a damn child  You just want it  You want some bush  Never 
[01:13:30]  Never do I want anything  But I want it to look like  It's 500 years in the future  Just completely  Like glass  Like glass  I really do  If I touch  I want my hand to slip off  It's just not  The only way I can deal with it  Is if it's  If it has personality  Without it  Yes  If you got those ones  That don't have personality  That must be Photoshop  Right there  Well now  Danny's finding some fine pictures 
[01:14:00]  That's a mess  But I take that too  That's horrible  Yeah  I want  That's a  That's a  That's really a mess  Alright let's  That ain't sexy  You know unfortunately  We have to go back  To the Obama thing  Because people are finding facts  Bob in Jersey  Go ahead  Yeah the reason  They collect  Their number one  And number two  Is because  Every piece of that  Gets analyzed  And that way  They find out  Yeah that way  They find out  There's any health problems  With the president  Before it gets out of control  Thank you sir 
[01:14:30]  They've done that  For about the past 15 years  That's why all these presidents  You'll hear they go in  For an undisclosed physical  That's why  I don't know about that  Dude  They get tested so many times  In blood work  That is exactly  Why they do it  That came right  From the secret service  There you go  They do that  For that reason  Apologize to me  Oh not yet  What do you do  Apologize to me  He's not even  Playing around  I need a backup  I need one more call 
[01:15:00]  It's not like  He had one of those  Secret service phones  So you couldn't even  Trace this call  Yeah you hear that  You hear that  Humming in the back  This guy works for the CIA  Who does that for a living  And how do you go through  Like with a coma  He's only president  For eight years  They act like they gotta  Keep him alive for 40 years  You're assuming he's gonna  Get the  Okay  Worst  He's got four or eight years  How healthy does he have to be  Make sure a ball doesn't hit him  Or doesn't fall in a flight of step  He'll be okay  Because people are trying  First of all  People are trying to kill 
[01:15:30]  Our president  Any way they can  In these crazy countries  You know  Maybe they wanna make sure  He's not being slowly poisoned  That's what I'm saying  You gotta keep it  But do you think  There's a lot  Less countries  That wanna try  Killing him now  No  I think that  There's more people  In the world  That you know  Like this guy  Than like Bush  When they find out  He's just gonna be  Another American president  After that  Which I  I agree with  In the end  They're gonna try  To kill him even more  Cause they're gonna go  He tricked us  But the other thing is  A lot of these countries  Are acting a little funny  Because they see 
[01:16:00]  How this country  Treats black people  So they're just acting funny  Going to war  Without permission  They wouldn't have did that  If Bush was in there  He's like  You know  Like a substitute teacher  Right now  What do you got  Stunt Brain  They don't have to  Collect all this stuff  Because there are toilets  That will analyze  Everything you do  We're talking on the road  Stunt Brain  We're talking these other countries  When he takes a dump  He has a special toilet  That analyzes everything  Who can buy it  There's a toilet  I ain't buying no  I'd love to have one  I ain't buying no damn toilet 
[01:16:30]  What's wrong with you  It'll tell you how your blood sugar is  It'll check everything  It's not us checking him  It's the  These other places  That are trying to  Create things to kill presidents  No  Especially the black president  Because I'm sure he has diabetes  And sickle cell  And high blood pressure  So they're gonna try to get him  By the way  When Israel attacked Gaza  Yeah  Bush is still president  But they did it  They did it  Oh S  No one really is doing anything  They know Bush is gone  They did their last little  Throw a shoe at him 
[01:17:00]  Just one last time  Yeah  And  Take this on your way out  Take a shoe  You idiots  And all they did was make some guy  Who made those ugly shoes rich  Because he had to  There's like 400,000 of those shoes  Being made right now  Yeah  But uh  But they wouldn't have did that  They wouldn't have just went to war  They're doing  The rest of the world  Is acting funny now  He's gotta come in  And slap somebody around man  Let them know  He's the HN  You know  I see up in there man  Let's go to Fontaine  Fontaine  Fontaine  You got more on this Obama waste thing

[01:25:00]  What are you gonna do  On Spike TV  There's an episode  Of Mansers  Where they discuss  Presidential poop  Yeah  And apparently  They do save all the poop  And put it in the lab  For analysis  Because the president  Of Egypt's poop  Was stolen  And people found out  He had cancer  And it caused a lot  Of like civil unrest  But how  Can you prove  That you had  The guy's poop  Exactly  When you just say  Nah that's  Some other dude's poop  Yeah really  A silver sharpie  How'd they know it's his 
[01:25:30]  A lot of rumors  Time for you to apologize  Man if it's true though  If I was Obama  If I was Obama  I'd eat a lot of chili dogs  If someone has to deal  With that crap  That's all I would eat  I'd take Metamucil  Right  Some White Castle  Yeah  Throw some White Castle  In there  Yeah  I bet you the guy  Who collects it  Better be nice to the president  Otherwise the diet's gonna change  Right  Have some chocolate milk  Mexican food  There you go  Have a nice day at work  Yeah enjoy this  Alright Patrice  I apologize to you  For your obsession  On Obama's poop  You were right

[01:26:30]  Yeah  They're fly-by-night fans  Who are now going to deal  With  I guess the fact  That Philly didn't win  Philly fans  And Pittsburgh fans  In the same building  What a  That would have been huge  Ugly thing  That would have been  A great Superbowl  Oh my god  Those people  Pittsburgh  But it's gonna be  Those Pittsburgh fans  Raping Arizona fans  In the stands  They're so polite  Those St. Louis  Sports fans  Very white  Very polite  What Arizona  I mean Arizona  Well yeah 
[01:27:00]  What am I saying  Well Arizona's  They've sucked for so long  I mean what kind of fans  Do you want them to have  They haven't won since what  1940  1948  How great could the fans be  They're all gonna be there  They got some money  You know some money  Over there in Arizona  How many games  Are you gonna go to  When you know your team  Is never gonna win  That's why there's  Probably more Dallas  I mean I'm rooting  You know  Innately I'm rooting  For Arizona  They haven't won anything  I mean and then  Kurt Warner  Had a good game yesterday  Yeah it was like  To see a big comeback  From Kurt Warner  Man he's like  A good quarterback  Again for some  And they stopped  Showing his wife 
[01:27:30]  Remember  Remember back  When he played  For the Rams  They just continually  Showed his wife  And I'm like  Why would they keep  Showing his mess  And they stopped  Doing that  And he's just like  A dude now  How old is he  He's probably  39  He's gotta be  Way up in his 30s  Right  Yeah he's close  And he's good though  From playing in that  What's that awful league  USFL  No no no  Canadian football league  No no  Keep going  Arena  No arena  And that's why  He's so good  In the blitz  And all that  And Larry Fitzgerald  They got  I've never even seen 
[01:28:00]  A receiver as good as him  Man he's amazing  That dude  So I mean  I think it's gonna be  A good game  I hope so  I hope they don't  Cardinals are strong  I hope they don't  Poop to bed  The Cardinals  That'd be fine  You know  I don't wanna see  Ben Roethlisberger  That awful name  No that's like a Nazi name  Yeah  We got the speed clip  That Patrice was talking about  We were talking about  Keanu Reeves  And how he just  Sucks as an actor  In everything  Like the movies  Have always been  Have always like  Kinda carried him  Instead of him  Carrying a movie  There's actors 
[01:28:30]  That carry movies  And then there's movies  That just carry  Everybody in the cast  And I think  He's one of those guys  And you certainly agree  Patrice  And you said  His worst acting ever  Was a scene in Speed  1994  When the bus  Crashes into the baby carriage  They found the scene  It was shocking  Where do we get an escort  Look up  What  What  Oh god  What  Oh my god  Oh my god 
[01:29:00]  Oh my god  Oh my god  I can't  I can't  I can't  I can't  I can't  I can't  I can't  I can't  I can't  I'm not bad  Oh my god  There was no bed  It was full of cans  Are you sure  Yes  Oh my god  I forget  Cans  You nailed it  Cans  The best acting  In that clip  Was by the cans  They sounded like  They were clanking  And scattering  They were very good  That just couldn't 
[01:29:30]  It shocks me  How bad that is  Why when you look back  At these blockbusters  You see horrendous acting  That movie was  So big  But it was  It was like another  Twister thing  Happening with that movie  I didn't realize  I didn't realize  How bad the acting was  It was the doorway  To speed too  Which was really  Which was good  With Patrick  Who's in that one  Patrick  Temuera Morrison  Had a part in that  Oh that poor guy  Who starred in one of the best  Films ever  Once were warriors  Dude they took him 
[01:30:00]  This country is good  For taking foreign  Famous foreign actors  With respect  And turning them into  Fifth leading bums  Yeah  They did it to him  And they made him  A fifth leading bum  In that movie  That Pamela Anderson  Was in  That awful barbed wire  That she got a tattoo  On her arm  Remember barbed wire  Was he in that  He was in the island  Of Dr. Moreau  Oh my god  And I just seen him  In a bad sci-fi  Network movie  Tamaru  What was his name  I think it's  Temuera Morrison 
[01:30:30]  He's a huge star  In New Zealand  Oh dude  You never seen  Once for warriors  No  It's great  You gotta see that movie  I'll put it on my list  He was like a big  He was like  The Marlon Brando  Of somewhere over there  Yeah  In New Zealand  Yeah  And he did the same thing  To Chalion Fat  You notice how  He wasn't going out like that  Chalion Fat  He saw what they did  To him putting him  With Mira Sorvino  He just went back to China  Good  And stayed respectable  Said hell no  Yeah  He did that  He did two movies  One with Scott  Whoever it was 
[01:31:00]  The karate movie  And one with Mira Sorvino  And he just went back home  Did he do replacement killers  Is that Chalion Fat  That was Mira Sorvino  Okay  But you know what  Chalion Fat doesn't speak  The best English  He's lucky they gave him  Anything over here  Temuera Morrison  Speaks perfect English  Chalion Fat speaks Chinese  What are we going to do with him  We're doing something  We're doing something  With that squeaky voice  Jackie Chan  Yeah but Jackie Chan  Speaks a lot better English  Than Chalion Fat  I think  No  No  No  No  No  Well he's charming  He smiles  He kind of has a Pete Rose haircut 
[01:31:30]  We like Jackie Chan  I don't know  Chalion Fat  Did violent vicious films  Yeah he's a serious dude  Yeah  That's what they should keep him in  But they just always  Bump you down to bum  Just bump you down  To just  They bumped him down  To Mira Sorvino's partner  Hey Kurt Warner's 37  And Patrice Cardinals  Sell out  Every game  They have real fans  No a lot of those fans  Are Dallas fans  Listen to how many cheers  You get for the other team  I sound like my aunt  The way I just phrased that  But you know what I mean  There's a lot of  Did you see how many 
[01:32:00]  People cheer  When Philly scored  Yes absolutely  Dude  They don't  They don't  Dude  People want to defend  Keanu Reeves  He was good in Point Break  Oh with Patrick Swayze  That stunk  Come on man  I haven't seen that movie  Somebody was good in Red Dawn  Like it's just one of those movies  It's been too long  I don't remember his acting  In that anymore  I just can't believe  How bad he is  Dave in Boston  How are you Dave  Not too bad  What's up guys  Welcome aboard Dave  How the Celtics doing  They started falling apart  A little bit on you guys  Huh 
[01:32:30]  You know I couldn't care less  Oh you're one of those  We went over this  We went over  Patrice brought it to the table  It's like  Boston finally has a really good team  But the racists up there  They just don't want to  Follow the all black  They need a white  They need a white hero in Boston  Right  I need a hero  He has to be white  I'm pulling out for a hero  Sports fans up there  In a quandary  They're like  This team is like  One of the best ever  But it's all black  And they're like  They come from  Remember that break we did 
[01:33:00]  They admitted it too  They came out of the woodwork  One black hero is Bill Russell  And that was just  They just need one white dude  They can at least go look  You know  Yep none  You see Larry Bird recently  What's he looking like  They did some commercial  With like some of the old legends  I forgot the commercial  And Larry Bird looks horrendous  He looked like that in 89  He looks horrendous  Like who would have thought  That Magic Johnson  Because I believe Magic's  In the same commercial  Would look way better  Than Larry Bird in the year 2009  Being that Magic  Magic should be looking like 
[01:33:30]  Like Kareem Abdul  The best line ever said  At a roast  Oh  I forget who it was  It was Samor  Samor who said  To Flavor Flav  You look like  Magic Johnson  Should look  Right  Greatest line  Unbelievable man  And Larry Bird  Always looked bad  But when he stopped  Working out  Yeah time hasn't been  Kind of this guy  He's got like  A massive  Massive pelican neck  It's kind of sad  To see Jordan losing 
[01:34:00]  A little bit  Getting soft  And that finger  Turned to the  Completely east  Right  That pinky finger  That's broken  He never get a fix  Yeah  But Matt  Probably helped his shot  That's why  Magic is looking fantastic  Look at this  Look at this  Larry Bird  If  He looks a little better  He looked like a bird  No kidding  Like a pelican  Look at this  He's awful  He looks better  Than the commercial  I saw  Jesus  He looks like Elmo  Oh  Look he's missing his teeth  He's just like  A healthy junkie 
[01:34:30]  Larry Bird's a mess  Let me see  It's sad man  Jordan now  I want to see  Jordan is getting  A little soft  And that  Depresses the hell  Out of me  Like when you see  Old footage of  Muhammad Ali  You're like  God damn  People forget  How great he was  He's not always  Freshly cut  Like back in the day  Jordan is  You'll never catch him  Not being cut  Yeah  And he has  Now you can see  The gray poking  Where his hair still grows  Right  Where he can easily fix  Because he's young enough  To fix that crap still  Ah jeez man  He just 
[01:35:00]  How about Tyson  You want to talk about  Someone that got a little chubby  Wow  Yeah Tyson is  Mike Tyson put on a few pounds  Oh man  There's nothing  No one wants  To see a fat Tyson  That's sadder than  Anything I can think of  Is a fat Tyson  Is that a picture of him now  Jordan  He looks alright there  Yeah right there  He looks  But he looks a little  Tired in the eyes now  He starts losing in the eyes  Patrick Ewing  Has that going on  He looks like  He's  Way too old  I guess that's what  Happens when you're famous  When you're young 
[01:35:30]  And delicious  When you're an athlete  Yeah  Oh man  And then you just become  What you should be  When you're 40  Look at Mike  You would think these guys  Would continue working out  But I guess you'd get sick  Of him after you retire  Right  Let's go back to Dave  In Boston  Dave you got a  Keanu Reeves line  Or something  My god  If you think the one  From Steve is bad  Yeah  Take a look at  Little Buddha  My god  Keanu Reeves  Trying to be  A god guy  And when he comes up  With the line  You mean I'll die  You've got to find it 
[01:36:00]  It is  Yeah let's try to find that  The worst  The worst acting  Ever  Ever  Okay we'll try to find  That one too  It's about time  He gets a beating  I don't  I can't think of one movie  Where he was  He carried the movie  With his acting abilities  Because like  Jimmy brought up  Devil's Advocate  I thought that was  Just an amazing movie  It didn't matter  Who played his  Character  The movie was just good  Look at Tyson's gut  Thank you Dave  Yeah  Just look at the girl  He's with him  Still with a gut  Girls are great  He has chubby legs  His legs are chubby 
[01:36:30]  Look how great girls are man  He's just a mess  And they're still just there  Yeah  God bless him  Probably his bad  Red Bull breath  You can see that  Red Bull  Cans there  Red Bull makes your  Breath stink like sugar  And dry mouth  I hate Red Bull  Never drink it  It stinks  Dude you want a Red Bull  I certainly don't  Awful  Why don't you drink this  One of the president's  Aids is carrying it  In a bag  Make your breath  Better than Red Bull  Danny  What do you got Danny 
[01:37:00]  This is something  I found a while ago  It was before he was famous  He was doing like  He was like reporting  For I think it was  Like a college TV station  Canada Reeves  Yeah  And this is him  Doing some report  About I think  A teddy bear convention  When Going Great  Sent me to check out  The first Canadian  International teddy bear  Convention  I thought I was in  For a lot of craziness  But then I met  13 year old Gray  He thought he was in  For a lot of craziness  Jimmy  At the teddy bear convention  How could you not  I mean you know  That sounds like a scene  From Devil's Advocate  That was his wife dying scene 
[01:37:30]  That's exactly the same  Range of emotion  No I liked him in that one  When he was trying to get mayor  I thought that was the  Best thing he's ever done  Was that scene  Yeah  He was very  He was very  Very believable  In that scene  As his wife cut her throat  No one's worse than  Christopher Lambert  But Keanu  Who is he  I know the name  I don't know what he's done  Chris Lambert  He played Greystoke  In The Legend of Tarzan  He played  Give me a picture of that guy  But then I met  13 year old  Graham Abbey  And his 53 bears 
[01:38:00]  And discovered  There's a serious side  To collecting teddy bears  What do your friends  Think about you  Collecting bears  They don't mind  Because it's collecting  That's great  Damien from The Omen  Collects teddy bears  What a creep this kid is  No eyebrows  He has the same hair  That Stunt Brain Wands  Just putting charcoal  And bleach on top  Of his stupid head  Looks like he rubbed  His head on a balloon  He probably grew into 
[01:38:30]  A plushie lover  This kid  Oh he's a creep  He probably dresses  As a teddy bear now  And has  He got that bald  Transvestite face  Yeah  He's hair like  The Illinois governor  He's a creep  He's collecting  It's not as if  I play with them  And they know  I'm not the kind  Of kid who would  Really play with them  Look at this bear  He's so soft  And cute  Oh let's see  Let's see  He's cute  Oh she's so cute  Look at that  Come on  Back down  Bear Jay  I've been looking 
[01:39:00]  All over for you  We gotta go down  To the bears only cafe  And talk bearsness  Listen  You know that  Bears necessity contest  We've got problems  So listen  We'll go down  We'll talk business  And hey  Everything will be okay  I love this guy  Well  As Graham Abbey says  If the bear fits  Wear it  You know what  I should have hung in there  Jimmy  That is no better  Than the early stuff  I was doing  That I put up online  Recently  What year is that?  84  1984 
[01:39:30]  Keanu Reeves  We'll put the video up  On onaradio.com  Oh my god  He's an handsome dude  Though  Jesus  Oh Keanu  Stupid Keanu  But you know  He's half something  Half something else  Of course he is  Why wouldn't he be  Half awful  Half terrible  You gotta be half and half  And then you're like  A supermodel  That's how it works  Half and half  Yeah thank you  Spiro says it  Old Keanu  Sounds like the old  Soapy tapes  Absolutely  He probably has  Some kind of  American Indian in him 
[01:40:00]  And Chao Young Phat  Was good in Pirates of the Caribbean  Someone is saying  Oh who cares  But he played  He played  A Chinese guy  Like he played  You know  He played what he's supposed to play  Chao Young Phat  Belongs in China  With John Woo  In China  Doing what they do  Without the American  Rating system  Ripping the bag  Off of both of them  Because John  There's no way  John Woo  Was going to do  A great John Woo film  In this stupid country  Hard target  With  What's his name  Jean-Claude Van Damme  That was a good movie 
[01:40:30]  I didn't see that  That was a John Woo film  I saw Face Off  Face Off was a great movie  I'll throw my coffee in your face  You didn't like Face Off  How can you  It was pretty good  Oh that stunk  With the awful touch  That Travolta did  The creepiest move ever  Yeah  Whenever he would leave his wife  He would take his fingers  And brush them over  The middle of her face  And that was the move  He would give her  Like that was supposed to be  The affectionate couples  Thing they did  And then when  Nicolas Cage 
[01:41:00]  Was in the body  I'm not  Castor Troy  Who by the way  This could be  Very dangerous  For me to say  Who by the way  Could be  In the top  All time  Worst actor  Nicolas Cage  He is a bum  He's a bum  He was good in  Valley Girl  With that performance  Or Arizona  Raising Arizona  He had me in tears  Why is he  Because he's royalty  He's like  F royalty  He takes me out  Every movie he's in  He is just  Every effing movie 
[01:41:30]  He's terrible  Ghost Rider  Was just shocking  That fingers  Across the face  You make me turn on  Face  But it was just  That was the big move  It was a good movie  It was a good movie  They had to say  How could they connect  How could they make  Travolta have such a bond  With his wife  That she would have  The moment where she  Knew it was him  With a new face  And that irritating thing  He did  Picture any girlfriend  You're dating  Picture if your move  Was to go goodbye  And then take your fingers  And brush them over  The center of her face  She would hate that 
[01:42:00]  Movie stunk  Bunch of doves  It was horrendous  I gotta go see the movie  I gotta see it again  It was terrible  I know we gotta  Take a break  Their lack of hair  But give us a minute here  I think that movie  Did stink  I'm sorry  Holy boy  It's dumb  It's dumb  Oh his little  His little brush 
[01:42:30]  Across the face  Cast the Troy  Cast the Troy  That was horrendous  What an awful name  They're going around  The column  Looking at each other  Oh boo  Boo  That was terrible  Jesus  Killing me  You're killing me  Those awful doves  Just so John Woo-ish  I forgot  I'm sorry  I'm taking  That movie stunk  I forgot about the dumb  With that dumb 
[01:43:00]  Oh  Oh that was horrendous  Oh John Travolta  And his tour divorce  When he played  Cast the Troy  The mean Cast the Troy  And a nice him  And they just reverse it  And they both thought  They was amazing  And those  Those dumb method actors  They probably sat in there  Like sucking each other's  Vibe up  Just terrible  Nicolas Cage  Probably put on  Travolta's awful wig  Tried giving a hummer  To a guy  In a 727  Oh face off 
[01:43:30]  Stunk  Oh my god  Face off  Stunk  Oh that's stupid  Cast the Troy  That dumb  Hand  That's how I found out  Did you ever see face off  Of course  Oh my god  Oh Jesus  See if you can get a clip  Of that from when we come back  Yeah  That stupid  Annoying finger brush  That you're smelling  In the state of the art prison  With the magnetic boots  Terrible  We gotta step aside for a second  And Danny  What else you got  You got terrible  Nicolas Cage acting 
[01:44:00]  Yeah  There's a clip from  The Wicker Man  That made me laugh  Really hard  The first time I heard it  Alright so  F Nicolas Cage  And his stupid royalty  Or how about in Tin Man  Or whatever  What was it called  Where he plays  The guy who  He added Tourette's  To try to give his character  Depth  And it had no bearing  On the film whatsoever  Matchbook man  Or matchstick man  Right yeah yeah yeah  He tries to add Tourette's  To people like  Wow this guy really  Goes another level  He should be shot  Wow he's got some range  Oh you changed my mind 
[01:44:30]  My face off  It stinks  You see a lot of dumb movies  I'm so sorry dude  My life face off  So nothing  Just made it stink  It just stinks now  It took him two minutes  Oh my god  We'll continue  Also speaking of bad actors  Joaquin Phoenix  A little story about  What he's doing now  Hopefully he has  Lip operated on  Stacy Keith  We don't need you  He's remaking  What was that  Twinkle Twinkle  Killer Kane  Tell Mike Hammerface 
[01:45:00]  To shut up  And retire  You bump  The O.P. and Anthony show  Oh boy  O.P. and Anthony  Anthony's out sick today  We got Patrice O'Neal  Killing for us  We were laughing  Through the break man  Because he's apologizing  To Jimmy over face off  It took Jimmy two minutes  To turn you on 
[01:45:30]  A movie you thought  You loved  I knew it was bad  But the things  You were picking up on  Things I was ignoring  Because I was just  Watching it  I don't know why  I thought it was good  That's why it took  So fast  You picked out  The things  That I was hiding  Inside  Questions  And it just was as dumb  That movie stinks  And I'm anti face off  That quick  People are like  Wow what a hell  Of a heel turn  You made with face off  Today  It just makes 
[01:46:00]  I like logic  He just broke it down  I couldn't even break down  Why it's good  That's why  Immediately he wins  He broke down  Why it stunk  And I agree  What do you say  It starts with the name  Of the movie  The name of the movie  Is face off  And it's about  Faces coming off  It's about  Faces coming off  It stinks  It's a heinous movie  Face off  And we just saw  The clip where  Travolta comes  And hugs his wife  And the daughter 
[01:46:30]  Runs in  And they look at  Each other lovingly  And he does that  That awful  It's like a blind  It's like David Patterson  Says hello to somebody  He just puts his hand  He just brushes  His dumb hand  Over her face  And her lower lip  Drips a little  When his finger  Brushes  See I remember  That he squeezed it  Like he would hold it  And pull the face  Like he's pretending  To pull the face off  He takes his hand  And strokes down 
[01:47:00]  The entire face  With his open fingers  Across each region  Of the face  Down over the mouth  Over the lips  It stinks  That's not even acceptable  If he Purelled  Right before he did it  His dirty hands  It just  I can't believe  Norton  I have no  Comeback for how bad  That movie is  I'm right with you  And let's stay  With Nicolas Cage  Danny found something  That's really funny  Danny  You guys have been  Making fun of face off  For a while  You and Travis  Yeah meet you  Every dude 
[01:47:30]  Since we've all  Known each other  As a group  We've been  Just bragging on that  Especially  Especially the part  Where Travolta  Is talking to his crew  He's the Nicolas Cage  Character now  But he's talking to his crew  He's talking about  What happened  He goes  They took his face  And then he makes  This gesture  Like he's taking the face  Off  Like Patrice had mentioned  Off  And like this big  Dramatic pause  They took his face  Off  And he's walking around  With the  With the lower  Derm  What's that  What's the second layer 
[01:48:00]  Of skin  Oh yeah  I was just watching that  On YouTube  Yeah  And he's just walking around  He's doing acting  With the  With the muscle  Tissue  He's smoking a cigarette  And it's just muscle tissue  He's smoking a cigarette  And a cigarette  Just walking around  Angry that he has no face  With his magnetic boots  And then he  When they come in  And they have  Completely different bodies  But since they have  The same faces  You think it's him  Oh yeah  John DeVolta  Who's pudgy  And Nicolas Cage 
[01:48:30]  Who works out every day  You know what  I got his face  I mean put  Opie's face  On my face  And I'm gonna walk around  And now  It's gonna be  Face off now  I got Opie's face  This is the same person  That loved the movie  15 minutes ago  It's stupid  I will never be your friend  Let me tell you something  You'll turn on your friends  Like that  No I will not  Because if  If someone comes up  With a better reason  Like if I'm going  Hey yeah I'm friends with Opie  And you go why  Because here's why I'm not  And somebody systematically 
[01:49:00]  Breaks it down  And I go  Wow  I was thinking  I shouldn't be friends  With him for those reasons  But you said it  You didn't even have  You didn't even have  A counter argument  To Norton's observations  About the movie  Because he picked out  The things that were dumb  And the things that are good  About it are dumb  Yeah  Like everything is dumb  About the movie  Now I gotta go  F and see that movie  Yeah  But he picked out  The worst of the dumbness  Yeah  With the hand  And the doves  The hand ruined it for me 
[01:49:30]  And the bullets  You can see the bullets  And somebody's moving  And they're doing  A video game thing  Oh god damn  Let's go to Danny  So you got a clip  Of Nicolas Cage  Yeah this is a clip  From The Wicker Man  Oh  And to be perfectly honest  I never saw the whole flick  But I was  I was shown this  This piece of audio  And I immediately  Busted out laughing  This could possibly be  One of the funniest things  I've ever heard  Good for you  It's not supposed to be funny  No  It's not supposed to be funny  What's happening in the clip  To be perfectly honest  I'm not exactly sure  But something is attacking 
[01:50:00]  Nicolas Cage  Let's just put it that way  He's being attacked by something  I wonder if it's one of the Coppolas  Hold on a minute  Is it the scene  Where he actually finds out  Like I said  I'm not sure  Because I haven't seen it  In its entirety  But just give it a listen  Let's take a listen  Oh no  Not the beast  Not the beast  Ah  I love my eyes  My eyes  Ah  Ah  And that's it  But it makes me laugh so hard 
[01:50:30]  Can you move  You've got to put that  In my replay  We're going to make that  A big one  Dude  You've got to go  From the moment  He finds out  That there's a cult  There's some kind of weird cult  The moment he finds that out  To the moment  He's burning to death  Yeah  Is the worst  It's excruciating me  Let's go to San Diego  From Santiago  Probably  In Denver  Yeah  Santiago  Yes  Hey guys  How's it going 
[01:51:00]  Hey  I watched that movie  When I was 16  In the theater  And I have not  Stopped talking about it  Ever since  I tried to tell my girlfriend  About the brush move  With the fingers  But my favorite part  Is when John Travolta  Is switching over  To Nicolas Cage  And they put this voice box  In him  And they go  Repeat after me  Peach  I can eat a peach  For hours  And it's John Travolta's voice  And all of a sudden  It gives this little  And it turns into Nicolas Cage  Peach  I can eat a peach  For hours  Well I bet you  That Travolta  Travolta probably  Couldn't say  I could eat a peach 
[01:51:30]  For hours  There's something  In his real life  That won't allow him  To say that  I could chew a ball  For months  No  Repeat after me  I could eat a peach  For now  No no no no  I could chew a ball  For a month  That stupid face brush  Dad were you eating onions  Oh no daddy's bag  Was itchy  I'm telling you  I can't  I have no  Retort  Cause I  I just liked it  And if anybody 
[01:52:00]  There's some movies  You go I liked it  But if somebody  Can give you  A good example  Of why it's bad  Yeah  I'll turn on that movie  In a minute  Alright  Speaking of actors  That we're shaky about  Joaquin Phoenix  Jimmy's talked about  Joaquin over the years  On the show  He was good in Gladiator  But he whispers his dialogue  He likes to whisper  Always whispers  He's terrible  He's terrible  He's terrible as Johnny Cash  He was terrible  And who was that  That bum  M. Night  Yeah what was in there  I'm trying to 
[01:52:30]  The village  The village  The village  Yeah he whispered  Through the entire movie  The home  Why would you do that  Yeah  Horrendous  You want to know  What he's up to  I'd love to  He's blown off Hollywood  Good  He's had enough man  Yeah  Yeah yeah  Joaquin Phoenix  Is going from acting  To rapping  Believe it or not  Phoenix said goodbye  To his career  In Tinseltown  And debuted his rapping  Skills over the weekend  In Las Vegas  Fellow brother-in-law  And actor Casey Affleck  Is following him  On the road  As he's set to direct  The documentary  On Phoenix's latest endeavor 
[01:53:00]  Even P. Diddy's on board  With the project  He's set to produce  Phoenix's first album  This has got to be a joke  This is not real  This has to be  A mockumentary  Nope  Nope  They're going to take it  As serious  Serious stuff  Joaquin Phoenix  Is going to be a rapper  Do you have any  Of the rapping  Sort of  But it's so noisy  It's really hard to hear  There is a clip  That's on  Most of the major  Celebrity sites  But it's like  Cell phone video  So it's so muddy  You can't really  Hear what he's saying  I'm sure I couldn't  Anyway  It was crystal clear 
[01:53:30]  Fix my lip  I gotta fix my lip  Stinks  Which is  Hair lips  They're horrible  And keloid ear bubbles  Are  And that's something  Black people get  But hair lips  And keloid ear bubbles  Is just one of them  Things you just can't  Look by  I can't look past it  He's growing a beard  Real quick  You notice that  He grew a beard  Wouldn't you  To hide that  That's why  He didn't want to  Be in Hollywood  Because every role  He did  He probably said  Can I grow a beard  Or do something 
[01:54:00]  To hide this  And they said no  Can I wear a mask  That's why I couldn't  Never look at  Stacey Keach  I enjoy my hair  But I'm just looking  At that lip  Fall up into his nose  And I'm just like  Terrible  Get away  It's terrible  Fix that or just go home  Uncomfortable to look at  By the way  Eat popcorn  And enjoy this  Wrecking it  To your face  By the way  We got a celebrity  Among us today  I didn't forget  About you JC  I noticed your mom  Was so bored  She was reading  Through the entire show  Thanks mom  Nothing makes us feel  Good about what we're doing

[02:05:30]  But I think we're going to lose the XM  It's ridiculous  It's a bad move  Alright we're wrapping up  You know we started the show  With Kenny singing  We should kind of like play this  One more time  Before we get out of here  To really bother people  Kenny singing the pride  By U2  Just a little bit  And stick around for Fedor  Because I'm trying to get  Patrice's face punched in  That would be awesome  That would be my goal  Also look for me on  Twitter.com  Decided to do some of that  Social networking finally  In the year 2009  I found one I liked 
[02:06:00]  I never liked the MySpace  Never liked the Facebook  But I liked the Twitter  It's easy  It's quick  I'm OB Radio  One word on there  I hate on Facebook  How they  Like every time  Somebody comments on me  Or writes on my wall  Or recommends me  Yeah  I get an email  It's so stupid  So-and-so has sent you  A little umbrella nudge  Shut up  So-and-so has invited you  To a fake snowball fight  A bunch of douches  I like to feel like  I'm in touch  But what's a fake 
[02:06:30]  Snowball fight for me  Exactly  I would no  Really  Deny  Deny  Oh you said no  Thank you  No I would never accept  I accept friends  And you know  Something like that  You know what  As far as Twitter goes  I'm all about followers  Not following  Yeah  They look at me  Talking a little tech  With the people out there  Twitter.com  I'm OB Radio  One word  And what was it  The umbrella nudge  What's that about  I don't know  It's just all these  You know what I'm talking about  What are some of the things  They have Sam  They're just terrible  You can invite someone 
[02:07:00]  To a food fight  Or a tickle fight  Alright let's go with  The tickle fight  So you invite someone  To a tickle fight  Then what happens  Well then you click accept  Do you actually like  Have physical contact  No  No  Never  No  Then how do you do  A tickle fight  Exactly  The computer decides  Who wins  Oh I didn't know  At that far  Because I never did  Anything but hit the eye  How about this  Tim Morton invites you  To a beheading  That'd be great  Well but then  You could see  Who has won the most  Tickle fights  From all your friends  Yeah  Alright I didn't know  Alright well that  Kind of makes it  Let me tell you what 
[02:07:30]  I'm also an eye reporter  That's right  The Opster is an eye reporter  Wow  Yeah  You know what eye report is  On CNN  I enjoyed the eye report  On CNN  Very good  It's like a paparazzi  You see news  You send them some news  And then all of a sudden  You get credit  And you get some hits  What is it called  You're a citizen journalist  That's right  That's what I am  Alright we gotta get  The F out of here  Patrice thank you  He already left  Yeah we'll meet him  Over there  You can't be bothered  With the mop up portion  Of the radio show  He's grabbing a burger 
[02:08:00]  Right now  We gotta talk about him  Being a vegan  Vegan  Not just a vegetarian  Patrice is all in  He's doing the vegan thing  That's right  It's been seven hours  Here's Kenny singing awfully  For literally 50 seconds  So hang in there  For the music marathon  That's gonna start  Right after Kenny singing  Actually doesn't Kenny singing  Start the music marathon  Sort of  What are they doing today  It is MLK  I knew you too  Huh  We did that already  Danny what's the first song  For the music marathon 
[02:08:30]  Give me a second  I'll tell you right now  They have to have  Some kind of like  Black and white theme  Political theme  It's gonna be  Get on your boots  You too  We played that already  They're playing it again  I played it  That's old hat Dan  By the way  It's okay  And I'm a U2 fan  That's cool  Cause after that  Then there's a whole bunch  Of stuff you ain't  Never heard before  Like what  Running with the devil  Under the bridge  What do these songs  Have in common  What do these songs  Have in common Jimmy  Running with the devil 
[02:09:00]  Under the bridge  Baba O'Reilly  I don't know what  Baba O'Reilly is  That's Teenage Wasteland  I don't know  I never heard it  But I like the other two  You've heard Teenage Wasteland  Maybe  What do I know  Teenage Wasteland  Yeah  Don't know it  Come on  I don't know it  I don't acknowledge that  Under the bridge  It's the only  You can't just say  You don't acknowledge  The who  I don't get it  You never got the who  No  I don't know it  But the only  The only chili pepper song  I like is  Under the bridge 
[02:09:30]  That's the only one I like  So they'll play that  That's fine  And Running with the devil  One of the very few  Van Halen songs I like  Opie  That link for Twitter  Says the page doesn't exist  Opie radio  One word  Exists  Maybe you should spell  Opie right  Opie  Yes  Or radio  They probably put an E  Instead of an I in there  Yeah  Radio  Radio  All right  Kenny singing to start  The music marathon  Here in New York  We'll see you over at the  Soundlight  One man come in the name of love 
[02:10:00]  One man come and go  One come he to justify  One man to overthrow  In the name of love  What more in the name of love 
[02:10:30]  In the name of love  What more in the name of love  XF202  Series 197  The virus  The Opie and Anthony  Show  Return  Live and uncensored  In moments  Do the pick  For now  Do the pick  Listen to the worst of  Ladies and gentlemen  You're about to hear  The awkward transition  As we bring on 
[02:11:00]  The fit  Phil  Yeah  What's the problem  I wanted to get the email  Address of the general manager  Are you like the idiot  That just wrote that email  That we just read  Yeah  Yeah  Well see there's no  Talking to people like you  Oh I see  Well of course  I mean you guys  You know you're so demented  That you don't see  Any harm in doing this  Or promoting it  I can't believe that you guys  Would actually not only  Allow this guy to do that  On air 
[02:11:30]  But also promote it  Yeah  And then these sick losers  Listening to your radio station  Who are actually  To carry you guys on  Phil are you like  A vegetarian and everything  Yes I am actually  So do you use any products  From animals  No I don't  No leather or anything  I'm a vegan no  Okay  I'm just getting a little feel  Of what you're all about there Phil  But wait a second  Even if  I'm not saying I'm against people  Eating animal flesh  If they're meat eaters  That's it  You know  I can't say anything about that  John likes mice 
[02:12:00]  What can I tell you  But you know  Yeah  Okay whatever  Well you know  He's not doing it for that  You guys are just  Doing it for ratings  Is that right  Yeah  If this guy comes up  With the idea  That he wants to eat mice  To win a trip to Hawaii  Who are we to say no  Just think of it this way  If it was somebody  That you guys love  No seriously  If it happened  If it's somebody  That you guys loved  Would you be promoting it  You can't equate  Somebody you love  With a little mouse  No  I understand  It is an animal  But you cannot 
[02:12:30]  Put it on the same level  As somebody you love  Being tortured  And some guy  Eating a mouse  Phil  Wait a second  No actually you can  If you're an animal lover  You can  So you love animals  With the same passion  That you love  Your family  Is that what you're saying  Phil that's a little sick  No it's  I can understand  Your pets and everything  But every living creature  On the face of this earth  If somebody's ready  To step on a mite  Would you get upset  Like your grandma's  Getting gang banged  In prison or something 
[02:13:00]  No  I think that's  Taking out of proportion  Well you're  Not really  This is what you were  Telling you  This is your logic  No my logic is  Would you go out  And save subway rats  Probably not  Why not  Why not  Why not  There are people  Out there  That love subway rats  Okay if people  Were killing them  Just for the joy of it  Then yeah I would  Like sitting on the  Platform plinking them  With the 22's  Or something  Yeah  For sport  If it was for sport  Or not even for sport  Because people are 
[02:13:30]  So demented  They think it's okay  But if they were  Doing it just out of  Cruelty  Because they want  To see another  Living thing die  Then yeah  Then I do think  That I would  This guy did get  Some nutritional value  Out of the mice  Whether that's what  He was going for  In the first place  He did  He did consume them  Okay but did he  Kill them first  Does the boa constrictor  Kill them  Does the boa constrictor  Have any other way  To survive  Actually they do  They kind of squish them  First with their  Little body 
[02:14:00]  Yeah but the boa constrictor  Needs to eat those  Things to live  This guy  Wait wait you didn't  Meet John  He needs these  Things to live  Well then  I have no pity  Then what happens  To this guy  Hey Phil I beg you  To contact all the  Groups out there  You'll just make us  Bigger  Yeah but well  That's just it  All of these groups  Of course it's  Going to make it  Just it's going to  Make it glamorous  And everyone's  Going to think  Wow this is cool  Let me listen to the show  But I'm sure not  The advertisers  Because advertisers  Are a little different  The advertisers 
[02:14:30]  Don't want negative  You scare us  You know what  You guys are right  Why don't you talk  I'm an animal  All right listen Phil  I'm going to give you  A break here  I'm going to put you  On the line with Todd  Who agrees with your stance  Let's see if you guys  Can hammer this out  Todd  I wanted to know  Phil are you gay  Yeah actually I am  What difference does that  Have to make with  An animal being killed  Now I understand why  There's a difference  You're a very sensitive guy  No I understand why  He's so pissed off  Because he's gay Anthony  Why  He wanted to you know 
[02:15:00]  Shove the mice up  His  I think that's an  Inappropriate remark  I didn't say  Where the mice  You know he wanted  To shove the mice up  You didn't even  Let me finish it  Phil  I personally want  To apologize for  Opie's rude statement  About sticking mice  Up your keister  He's a little more  Compassionate because  You know he feels  A bond with the mice  Let me ask you a question  Yeah  You're not a meat eater  No  Oh yes you are  You eat toothpaste  You eat toothpaste  With vein  Okay yeah I do 
[02:15:30]  But I don't  I don't ingest it  I don't know that  Cruelty to penis  Well you have  You have a different view  On animals  On this planet  Than some other people do  Phil  Some people see them  As a lower life form  Where the top of the food chain  To be used  As we wish  Here on this planet  For as long as we're here  You see them as  Cousins and grandmothers  And butt toys  Playmates 
[02:16:00]  I'm trying to carry on  A conversation with Phil  So am I  Opie's doing butt jokes  Phil  John  What about that  Hey what's up guys  Hey Phil mind your own business  Oh why don't you  Shut up you fat  Oh that's what I am  That's what I  Malesy doats and doatsy doats  You little lamzy dizey  Are you actually telling me  You have more people  On air right now  Or more people that are  Supporting what you're doing

[02:23:00]  Flat ass  Right  What's the matter  Quincy  I was cutting  Into his face  And he talked  To me  Sam  He spoke  To me  He picked that  Chick up  From the slab  That's why  Her ass is so flat  It was just  Sitting on a  Cold slab  The blood  Coagulated  In her lower spine  Sam  There was no  Cushion  For the pushing  Sam  That's why  I need you  The best  Quincy ever  It's amazing  And for the new

You know what Facebook does  That MySpace doesn't do  Like when you have friends  You can't just mass click them 
[02:31:30]  You have to actually go through  One person at a time  And say you're my friend  MySpace you only do 10 at a time  So it doesn't matter  I mean it's like  Still if you have 400 people  You have to do 40 clicks  Not 400  That's annoying  But you can only have  5,000 friends on Facebook  Someone thinks I'm loyal  Oh, you can't go higher  Than 5,000  No  Wait, what, Robert?

[02:33:00]  Send you a letter  Say you suck  I do want to get into  Big news in Patrice's life  I want to talk about this a little bit  What?  That you're a vegetarian  Actually a vegan  Oh  That's crazy  Yeah  What?  No more barbecues?  Yeah, how are you going to do the barbecues?  How much fun is your house not going to be anymore?  Remember those?  Remember seeing him right in front of the big barbecue  No  Come on, guys  Have some tofurkey  I might do that, though  I'm not against other people 
[02:33:30]  Who wants eggplant?  If you still want to eat  Oops  Sorry  He hops on the grill  I didn't even mean it like that  Who wants eggplant?  I didn't  I swear to get it  I know you  I know you  I saw his face light up  It's really mouly on  Eggplant is the worst food ever  It is  I wouldn't stop cooking meat  I'm not a fucking asshole  Vegetarians have this attitude  Like it's really their thing  And if they don't really feel like you're one of them 
[02:34:00]  They'll look at you funny  I went to a couple of vegetarian places  And they just, you know  A couple of sissies  And some big giant head Chinese girls  That just look at you like  You're not really  You're fat  Like, hey, fuck you  Just give me my soy ribs  What's a soy rib?  You know, fake ribs  They can make  They can make  Soy fish and shit  They can make a lot of stuff out of that soy  Vegetable patties  Is this a choice  Or is it because you had to?  Nah, it was like  This  Noriega  I was on this radio show  And Noriega was on it 
[02:34:30]  The rapper  And he read this book called Skinny Bitch  And he was like 5'7  300 pounds or something  And he lost like 70 pounds  And he just loves it  But I read the book  And it did  It did the same thing for me  That it did for him  Skinny bitch  What'd it say  To make you stop eating meat?  It just  It just  Because you cook some good food  Yeah, man  We're depressed  We want to be at your barbecue this summer  Exactly  How about you cook some stuff for us?  And you have an onion  Yeah 
[02:35:00]  Okay  I would do that  I mean, it exists  You'll be able to sit in front of the barbecue  Cooking up the steaks and the ribs  And those  Without even  Without even  Foot-long hamburgers  As a matter of fact  I may not  I may not  Because of why I stopped eating meat  It's not necessarily  Because if it was all about health  I would have stopped a long time ago  So, you know  When somebody's shocked  Into not smoking  Or not drinking  It kind of  You know  I was shocked into not eating meat  It's an animal thing  Yeah  Like that's why I don't eat  I don't eat veal  I haven't eaten veal  Since I've seen how they make veal 
[02:35:30]  So I made a point  Not to watch how they make food  But, you know  Watching how they make animals  And the suffering animals  Actually just  They have the same feelings  And the same shit  That goes on with them  So, if I fucking  Wait a minute  Before you get into  Clever quip  No, I wasn't  I was actually going to comment on that  That's interesting  You were saying that  You fucking psychic  They cut off  They cut off  Birds' beaks  And in fact  You know  You're just eating their misery  And that cruelty  And that suffering  So that's why I stopped 
[02:36:00]  I agree with you  But birds should be taught  To quit pecking  They slice off their beaks  And they fill them  And the fact is  After they slice off their beaks  They fill them with  Antibiotics and stuff  Just so that they can live  Until they kill them  But Patrice  This goes against our classic bit  That we did with you  Remember  Like cheetah knuckles  And  Yeah, I can still do that shit  Remember that bit?  I'm not  We should replay that a lot  I'm not a fucking white girl about it  I just  I just stopped  That was one of the funniest  Fucking segments ever  On this show 
[02:36:30]  It's hilarious  When we were talking about all the  Cheetah heels  It's nothing funnier  What was the best one?  The whale blowhole  Fucking saute  Whatever the hell it was  Jesus  Koala nose  Right  With a  Owl scalp  Right  Some owl eyes  And some fucking whale blowholes  Yeah  It was  You know  I don't give a shit  Keep eating  Here's what the book does  It just says  Things that you do bad  Right  And it tells you  We all know we do  If someone drinks  Right  They already are at  They're standing there  With two knives 
[02:37:00]  Ready to say  You know  Drink is no good  And smoke is no good  It's just  They say  Look  Smoking is fucked up  But keep doing it  I don't know you  But if you want to be  A certain way  Don't smoke  But they're like  Who gives a shit about you  I don't care  Just buy my book  And die  That's basically  What these two girls did  And it works  It's interesting  So I'm trying  Not to eat fucking nothing  But you did it  Partly because of the way  They kill the animals  That bugs you  That's why  I haven't eaten veal  My whole life 
[02:37:30]  Because I saw  How they make veal  And I stopped  Anytime there was  Something about  How do they do it  They keep a baby cow still  In a box  And feed it  And feed it  And pump it full  Or whatever  It needs to be pumped  Until it falls down  And then they know  It's ready  So it's like  A little prince  For a little bit  A what?  They treat it like  A little prince  No it can't walk  No it just doesn't move  And it gets sore  As soon as it falls  Then they know  It's ready for harvesting  They know it's ready  For just 
[02:38:00]  You know  Killing  That's how they kill it  But in the arborsoir  You know  Animals  You know  Whatever  And the what?  Abattoir  Slaughterhouses  Slaughterhouses  Wow  You know  They just murder them  They murder  It's murder  I saw  They kill turkeys  They hang them upside down  And stick a electric  Electric pipe in their mouth  And they hit a button  And it just goes  And they just  Every single one  Does the same thing  Just goes  And just  Their wings go straight up  And then fall  And that's this  Yeah  I like eating animals 
[02:38:30]  That just die of old age  Like I would love to eat meat  If all animals just died of old age  Or whatever  Heart attacks  They'd be fine to eat  They didn't  They didn't have  Gamey  And they didn't have  Gamey burgers  They didn't have an explanation  A 500 year old lobster  Right  For fish  They didn't really  They said they don't eat fish either  But they didn't really have a real explanation  For why not to eat fish  So I think people  Our bodies are made to eat fish  Like our fucking intestines  Like our fucking intestines are  You know  If fish were able  Well there's too much mercury in fish  If fish were able to like blank  Then it would be a different story  Well that's what I'm saying  I used to do a fucking thing 
[02:39:00]  It's like it's just  It's just  I know  I'm saying  Thank God  Fish don't have eyebrows  My food comes murdered for me  Like if I had to murder my own food  I would have definitely been a vegetarian years ago  But if I had to eat an am  I could eat fish  They just don't  We were having this discussion last week  No eyebrows  We said things would be different  If you put the head of the meat on the plate  With what you're eating  Yeah with the face it made right before  Right it would turn a lot of people around  They say pigs  Pigs and those things beg for their lives 
[02:39:30]  Like they know that their friend got killed  And they snuggle up to the killers  Like puppies  To say don't kill me please  Like because they know their boy just got  You know fucked over  You know for my sandwich  And also when something dies  It rots  We're eating  Dying  It's just death  Meat is death  But I know that already  I knew that before I'm talking this shit  But it just  Yeah but how good is a pork loin  It's fucking delicious  God  Why does shit 
[02:40:00]  I had some pea soup just now  That's what exactly what it tastes  Piss  Right  It tastes like shit  Yes  I can't wait  I'm gonna throw it up against the wall  Remember that  Fucking shit  Remember those steaks you made this summer  Yeah  The big ones at the end  You held them  Fucking out on plate  You filled up all the women on like bread and salad  Yep  And the guys ate meat  Patrice is the best barbecue ever  Nice  He saves all the good shit  Yeah  For like three hours into the barbecue  Everybody's full  Drunk  And then he knows the fatos  He'll be like  Man meat baby  I can't wait to replay this segment 
[02:40:30]  In about six months  When Patrice is back to eating meat  But the only thing keeping me not  Is what I'm saying about the thing  If it's about health  Yeah  Won't happen  But I tell you what  My shits are much better  Yeah  Boy oh boy  They're not like just like mooey  Like eggplant  Like grass  Mooey  What's a mooey shit  It's like  When I have like a steak  My shit comes out  This nice  Rounded log  You know  When you have like just salad 
[02:41:00]  For a couple days  It just comes out of my ass  Like a  Bobby  The type of shit  Where you know  You know it's cleaning off the walls  On the way out  Yeah  It just comes out  And still has like  Nah man  My shit  Is  It's  It's despicable  Yeah  It fucking sticks to the side  Of the toilet  It's just  Does your ass  Does it smell  Like really bad  And it stays in their beef  It stays in your intestines  That's why everybody's putting  Fire hoses in their asshole  To clean out their  That is true  Fucking cold  I actually had the lady  When she was doing my colonics  She was like do you eat meat 
[02:41:30]  And I'm like yeah  She goes you don't chew it do you  You just eat like  You don't chew it  You had unshewed meat in your colon  Dude I had  The machine went like this  Dug dug dug  And she went wow  What  I swear to god  She had to  Restart the shit clean  Yeah  Yeah but you went to like  You went to a questionable place  That's another great  It was a chick's apartment  She's not questionable  That's another great segment we did  There was a  What did she do  Hook it up to her fucking sink  There was a window in the room  I could see like an old lady  Cooking pasta  In her apartment  And where was this shit going 
[02:42:00]  That sounded clean  The shit  I don't know  Into a bucket  Probably funnily into bottled water  Jesus  And you get colonics too right  Hell no  I tried it  I did try it once  I got the new colonic  It was too fucking  But you don't eat red meat  I tried it once a while ago  Because I was having a little  Something something happen  Yeah but they have a new  It was just too creepy  They have a new one  And I went to a legitimate place  And it was  Nah  They have a new one  Where you do it yourself  You just go into a room  A self colonic  Yeah you lie in this bed  You just get on a tippy toe squat  It's like a chair 
[02:42:30]  Lying down  And you have to stick  You have to stick the thing  In your butt yourself  The little hose  But I actually pushed it in  Way too far  And I unplugged it  From the machine  I had to wait for the lady  To come back in  And like  Scoop my ass backwards  And she had to plug it  Back in on the machine  Because I just kept  Jamming it up my asshole  Hilarious  You fucking sized hose  She said one inch  I put it up like six inches  Mr. Kelly  This is the fire hose  Why do one  When you can have six  You just prolapsed your asshole 
[02:43:00]  I have no asshole muscle  It just fucking  Just went right up  Just the inside  Of your asshole  Was outside  And you just  Fucking  That's what I'm saying  But this one was cool  Because you lie down  In this bed  With your feet up  Kind of up to  Your knees bent  And once it gets going  It just shoots water up  And then you just  Shit  You shit the bed  But it's shaped  So the shit goes  Right into this canal  And then you can  Watch it through  This big tube  And you can see  Like you know  You can see like  A fucking sea urchin 
[02:43:30]  An octopus  Pieces of feta cheese  Your mother's face  Just coming by  It was awful  A couple more things  On the pigs  Before they go away  And then we'll get back  To this  Lance in New York  Lance  Yeah  I just wanted to say  What's going on guys  I want to say to Patrice  Not all slaughterhouses  That like  That they write about  In these books  Are as bad  As what they seem  Like  So can you tell me  Give me an example  Of a wonderful slaughterhouse  I don't know names  Of slaughterhouses 
[02:44:00]  Patrice  No no no no  Not names  There's my face  Fucking  Give me a wonderful way  To kill my food  No like  A lot of  A lot of these books  And stuff  Write about how  Like they cut  Cow's necks  And stuff  And like  Kosher killing  Is really disgusting  I don't like that shit  Cause they really do  Just slit the throat  And let the thing  Die out  But a lot of the  Stuff they write about  In these books  Are these like  Little tiny Alabama  Slaughterhouses  That do like  Ten chickens a day  And they're just  Horrifying  But for the most part 
[02:44:30]  It's any of the big places  That you get meat from  It's all humane killing  It's all clean  It's not like  Disgusting and dirty  And all that shit  But how  Do they humanely  Is there  Let me ask you  If there was a place  That just killed  Human beings  Right  Right  And is there a humane way  Like even if they  Like executions  Right  Lethal injection  They're just killing you  That's what it is  Alright  What's the humane method  Patrice  Ask a question  What was the humane method  Sir  Yeah  Well like  The way they used to  Kill cows  By just slitting  And throwing stuff  They don't do that anymore  They do  Like that thing 
[02:45:00]  In No Country for Old Men  That bolt gun  Oh that's humane  Oh yeah  That's much better  A bolt gun  And then what do you do  Does a cow lay down  With his eyes open  And he closes it for him  And kisses him on the cheek  It goes right into the brain  And kills him instantly though  Like they don't feel anything  It's just done  Alright  But still  Let's say  Let's say this  Let's say all animals  Were killed humanely  Well all that shit  That's what it does  To help me eat right  But the fucking  We're not supposed to eat meat  We're not built for meat 
[02:45:30]  That's what I'm telling you  If we're not built for meat  Then how come all the vegetarians  Have to like  Take all these vitamins  And pills and shit  That you  We all have to take vitamins  And pills  But they don't  We can eat vegetables  And not have to do anything else  It's no one ever had  Protein deficiency  It's just no  You've never heard of it  Why do vegetarians  Have the worst farts  I'd love to know that  It smells like grass  I don't know  And my farts have been horrible  Vegetarian farts are offensive  They're horrendous  Very bad  Alright thank you sir  Let's go to Gucci Cleveland  Before we lose him  Cause it's coming right out  As opposed to being stopped 
[02:46:00]  By a clog of meat  That's running by  Looking like your mother's face  Just fucking  And here's the thing  Don't attack me motherfucker  Everybody knows  Being a vegetarian  Is a better way of eating  Just stop  I'm not fucking  I'm not one of these people  I don't give a fuck  Eat meat  Are you a vegan or a vegetarian?  Vegan  You're the big one  He goes all in  You're all in  All in  So you can't  Jesus man  Isn't that hard though?  How are you gonna find food to eat?  Of course it's hard  I eat cakes  I've eaten cakes 
[02:46:30]  Along with steak  At the same time  I can't get steak  That's two pieces  It's a cake steak sandwich  It's a cake steak sandwich  Two pieces of steak  With cake in the middle  And a live  And a live cat foot  To follow  Cake and steak  Nigga  Absolutely  I watched this show  Man vs. Food  And he just goes around  He had a fucking  A cheeseburger  It was eight cheeseburgers  I got up against the TV  And started crying  With my face against it  Rubbing my face against the TV 
[02:47:00]  It looked so  Fucking good  Fucking good  It was in Boston right?  Dude it was  Some of the food  The fried clam plate  Wait a minute  They have a sandwich in Chicago  And that's what I'm saying  It's a roast beef sandwich  And they dip it  It's a vat of gravy  After they make the sandwich  They dip the entire sandwich  In gravy  And then give it to you  So the sandwich  The bread  Everything has gravy  Soak it in gravy  And it  I loved it  Because the health part 
[02:47:30]  Is not  It does not faze me  It's just  What it is  It's  It's rotting flesh  Right  And it's  And we're not supposed to eat meat  We're not meaty  I never thought of it like that  Alright let me go to that  It's rotting flesh  Hold on  It's rotting flesh  It's dead  That's why it has a date on it  Like eat before this  You're not rotting right now  Because you're alive  When you die  We start rotting  Whether you're in a freezer or not 
[02:48:00]  There's no such thing as fresh death  Vegetables rot too though  I had a filet last night though  That was  I bet it was  God it was like butter  It was melted  Dude I can't  What can I do  Are you  Bacon  You're done with bacon  You can't be done with bacon  I'm going to keep eating bacon  Oh you are  As I say I'm a vegan  Shut the fuck up  Wouldn't you be  I'm a vegan  Except I eat steak and bacon  I love cheese and fish products  But I no longer eat liverwurst  But I do fuck girls with hairy armpits  Yes  I fuck girls with hairy armpits 
[02:48:30]  I got some more pig knowledge for you  Gooch in Cleveland  Go ahead  What's up guys  Hey  My cousin works at a slaughterhouse  And was telling me that sometimes  When the pigs are all lined up  To be slaughtered  That some of them just drop dead  Of heart attacks  That's kind of funny  And that's what we're eating  It's kind of funny  If you saw that  It's just a pig going  Oh I can't take it Murray  Murray I'm going to die  B-B-B-B  Hey later guys  Love you  Alright man  See a pig walking like Fred Sanford  His little tail just goes straight in the air

[02:53:00]  Like I know what to do  Lamb chops  I know that I want my lamb chops  Yeah lamb chops  Wait  You eat a steak  You can't just go  Ooh that  I was getting two sausages  And they come out with sausage  I know what they come out with  Sausage and chicken  Sausage and chicken at the same time  Boom right off the bat  It's a nice chicken leg  And two sausages  And good sausages too  Then they come out with the filet  Wrapped in bacon  Bacon filet  Then they come out with a giant beef rib  On a table  God  Then they come out with a  They never come out with ham 
[02:53:30]  Unless you ask  I guess ham is  You gotta ask for ham  And then they slowly bring out the baby backs  Cause  Cause that goes fast  Well it goes on a rolling table  Anything  When I see a  When I see a  A table on wheels  I know something  And a whole pig  With an apple in his mouth  Oh god  Can I tell you something  I wanna eat a pig ear  Patrice how you're talking  You're gonna be a meat eater again  By fucking Saturday  Yeah  You just don't have it in your head  It's like  You don't have it in your head  To keep this up  But here's what it is  You hear yourself talking about  The meat products at this place  He's not only gonna eat veal  He's gonna fuck it  Right  I have not 
[02:54:00]  He's gonna teach a lesson  Before he eats it  It's a new way of killing it  When I look at veal  I go  This looks like it probably would be a good  But the way I don't eat it  I have never  I haven't eaten it  You ever have  And since I  Since I was 11  When I first saw  You ever have  And I'm not a fan  What is it  Pate or whatever  Yeah  And how they have to like  Enlarge the liver of the goose  To get the good pate  It's so good though  Well you see how gooses treat us  Fucking USA  Fuck the geese  Fuck them and their pate  The two of them 
[02:54:30]  They were the suicide bombers  Yeah  Motherfucker  I gotta pee  I mean I'm just saying dude  I will never argue  When anybody wants to eat meat  I hear what you're saying about  I had to kill a duck once  And it fucked me up  Why the fuck did you have to kill a duck  I worked on a farm  When I was on a juvie hall  They made me work on this farm  And we had to take care of animals  And we had to take care of goats and sheep  And this duck got fucked up  And the guy was like  You're gonna chop its head off  Yeah  And the kid was like  I'll do it  And he didn't  He kind of  He went to do it  And he pussied out at the last second 
[02:55:00]  And just sliced its neck  And then when I can't do it  I can't  And ran away  So I had to take the axe  And lop it off  And don't forget  We eat animals dude  That we eat animals  That we don't give a fuck about  We don't eat dogs and monkeys  And a lot of people  A lot of fucking places  Eat dogs  Yeah  They eat animals that we consider cute  And very charming  But imagine them fuckers  That fucking chop up our pets  But we eat animals though  That we can reproduce in a year  I mean like  Japan  They'll fucking eat whale meat  A fucking whale can't just have a baby 
[02:55:30]  And then  It takes like a fucking  A hundred years to have a fucking kid  And they just kill it  Which is why we don't  Why we don't drink squirrel milk  Is cause  Cow milk  Right  Is just easy to come by  Yeah  Squirrels are so small  You'd have to fucking ring one  You'd have to ring one out for a month  To have cereal  You could have a little espresso  Punching his asshole for months  Exactly  Just to get some good cereal  You'd have to get some lion cum  Something else  To fucking make your cereal edible  It's all fucking funky shit dude

[03:06:00]  That we were talking  About the stare down  Before  Yeah  And Fedor  Just looks like  A friendlier guy  Like he doesn't  Look like he's  Trying to intimidate  No  He looks like  A really nice guy  He could be  The Russian Santa Claus  I made him laugh  Thank god  Yeah  Thank god  Because he got that  So question  This is my  Real question  I know  He's fighting  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A 
[03:06:30]  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  I'd probably  Consider a couple  Fighters  That are  Besides me  I'd probably 
[03:07:00]  Andre  Orlovsky  Tim  Silvia  Frank Mir  Frank Mir  Yeah  Frank Mir  Andrei Orlovsky  Tim Silvia  Those are  You know  Those are guys  In the top five  Is Rocky 4  His favorite Rocky  Randy Couture  Was that a happy ending  Or a sad ending  For you  I've seen the Rocky movies 
[03:07:30]  But I'm not that huge  Of a fan  I like the movie  Knockdown  With Russell Crowe  I'm not sure  What the English  Title was  But  It was a movie  With Russell  Oh I  Probably  No  The fighter  The fighter movie  The boxer movie  With  Yeah  That was  What we call  The Cinderella  Man  Cinderella  We gave it a little  Russians gave it  A cool name  We gave it  A gay name  Knockdown  How about 
[03:08:00]  You didn't mention  Brock Lesnar  Is Brock Lesnar  Do you think  Just getting too much  Press and too much  Attention  Do you think  Brock Lesnar  Is Brock Lesnar  Too much  Press  But did he  Not deserve it  No  No  No  No  I wanted to  name Brock Lesnar  But I didn't  Not at all  I actually wanted to  List Brock Lesnar  On that list  But you guys  Cut me off  Who cut you off  I certainly  Didn't mean to  Who didn't  Who didn't  Who didn't 
[03:08:30]  Who didn't  Hey so  Would you rather  Do you really  Want to fright  Randy Gator  Do you want to  Fright  Do you want to  Fright  I'm a little  Scared  If you punched  His neck  Do you think  He could fix it  I hate the fact  That he pointed  At me  And they're both  Just laughing  At my neck  And his  His fist  Would just  Go right through  In order to 
[03:09:00]  Become the shape  Of his fist  He looks like  A Fader clone  That didn't make it  Is he bummed out  That he's not  Going to be able  To fight  Randy Gator  That's a good question  No I'm not terribly 
[03:09:30]  Disappointed  Because  You know  I like hanging out  With him  We're friends  And I've got  A lot of affection  For him  So without  Meeting him  In the ring  At this point  It enables me  To grow  Our friendship  So it's  Harder for you  To fight  Somebody  That you like  Is it  Harder  Do you have  To not like  Them  Well 
[03:10:00]  Yeah  I mean  In this  Particular case  If I had  My preference  I'd rather  Not fight  Him  As opposed  To another  Opponent  Now  I think  He knows  That  I think  Couture  Is a great  Fighter  But I think  Couture  Is an older  I was worried  About  I like  Randy  Too  And I was  Worried  About him  Fighting  Fedor  Because I think  He's an older  Guy  He would have  Had a serious  Trouble  Yeah but that's  Not what he told  Randy when he  Was in here  No I told Randy  Believe me  I sucked up to Randy  When Randy was 
[03:10:30]  Sitting here  I said  Oh Randy  You'll kill him  Randy  He doesn't have a chance  Is he married  Is he married  No  So is it  Some fighting  Groupies on there  Girls who love to fight  Did he ever bang a jersey chick  Well you know  Groupie  I just wanted to hear 
[03:11:00]  That translated  Dude did you translate  What a groupie is  You're trying  What a groupie  Groupies are  Those girls  Who are standing  behind you  When you're  Around the ring  And all  Yes  Little  Sibiakas  On the side  Baby  Sibiakas  Just some  You know  They just love  Them  But there are  Those girls  Who come to the  Or they try  To meet you  Well  It's possible  Yes  I'm a Christian  I'm not  Yeah  I mean  These type of girls  Exist  But you know  I'm a practicing 
[03:11:30]  Christian  And I try to keep  Well  You had  Me too  Toughest fight  You said  Mirko Krokop  Was the toughest fight  That you had  The toughest one  And he had a lot  Of trouble  When he came over  He lost a couple  Of fights  Why do you think  He lost  When he left  Pride  And came over  To UFC  Was it like  The cage  Fighting in the cage  No I don't think 
[03:12:00]  The cage  Made any difference  I just think  That he  He got to a point  Where psychologically  I think  He had some issues  And he wasn't able  To overcome those  When he came over here  I like the way  You put  Like in your translation  You act  Like the character  You act kind of  Like him in it  You put the emotion  Into it too  Thank you very much  You just translate  I appreciate it  You have the little 
[03:12:30]  Angry stare  Like you're saying  The inflection  Is perfect  I heard something  About you too  Which was  That you kind of  You try to not  Hurt your opponent  Too badly  And then  If he doesn't  Respond to that  Kindness  And he starts  To be even more  Aggressive  Then you really  Have to put him down  When you go to the ring  You try to not  Hurt your opponent  Not really  Hurt your opponent  But if he  Will you  Hurt your opponent  Then you  Hurt your opponent  And you  Hurt your opponent  Is it true?  No, I don't think that's the case. I just try to perform my work to the maximum of my ability, so if I've got to take somebody out, I've got to take them out. 
[03:13:00]  Who doesn't he like in terms of fighters? I'll fight them in the street.  I'm pretty well respected and I get along. 
[03:13:30]  Nobody talks shit. Nobody's talking any shit.  It's the same thing as Anderson Silva though.  I'm not a fan of the fans.  I'm not a fan of the fans.  I'm not a fan of the fans.  I'm not a fan of the fans.  I'm not a fan of the fans.  I'm not a fan of the fans.  It's the same thing as Anderson Silva though.  It just seems like he's there, Anderson Silva's there. 
[03:14:00]  I can't even name who else would be in that level where people just don't want to mess around with him.  People just go, I'm just going to...  Nobody wants to badmouth him because they don't want to get back to him in case they have to fight him.  That's exactly what's happening.  He likes to get to know the fighters and not only in the ring, but also...  Has he ever been afraid of somebody?  He's going to say no to that.  Come on.  Fighters are afraid.  Fighters are afraid.  Well, yeah.  I mean, we're all people.  I mean, you know, we get nervous, so... 
[03:14:30]  With that, what is he afraid of in this world?  If it's not like another fighter.  If it's not like another fighter.  What scares Fedor?  What if he says spiders?  What are you looking for?  What if he says spiders?  What are you looking for?  It probably is.  We're talking about.  We don't care about his phobias.  We want to know what?  I'm actually curious.  I want to know.  I want to know.  I want to know.  I want to know.  If you put somebody's eye socket through the back of his skull or whatever.  I actually want to know.  Because as a person, he's a great fighter. 
[03:15:00]  But what as a guy, you frighten him?  Just like a person, if you're afraid of something.  Actually, I haven't really thought about it.  But, I mean, I'm sure, you know, I've got some sort of concerns or fears.  Like, if I saw a big spider, I'd probably be a little nervous about it.  And then he'd punch it in the face.  Just get his fucking phobias, boy. 
[03:15:30]  Like, why not?  Scared in the dark?  What the fuck?  Can I ask you a question?  What style of martial arts do you, I mean, uh, Sambo, but you have Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,  right?  No, not Jiu Jitsu.  I mainly do Sambo.  Sambo mostly.  So what is, I don't understand what that, I really, I don't understand what that is fully.  Where is it from?  Sambo is one of the types of fights.  I think, first he gave a push. 
[03:16:00]  First he prepared me to fight.  But later he had to develop himself and take some lessons from Sambo.  Yeah, well, Sambo is kind of like my foundation.  You know, that's what I grew up with.  It's a national sport in Russia.  It's kind of like Judo.  And it prepares you very well for mixed martial arts.  But once I started practicing mixed martial arts, then I, then I picked up different disciplines, boxing, Muay Thai.  Right.  It's, it's, you can't, in this day and age in MMA, you can't, uh, you know, depend on one discipline of martial arts. 
[03:16:30]  So you've got to become well-rounded.  That's what I was going to ask.  Like my big, my, where I was, I most love watching, uh, martial arts was back with, um, when the Gracies, when it's, you know, movies like Bloodsport and stuff, where it's like your, what does he think about?  Your, what does he think about, okay, let's have a tournament where it's like, okay, Sambo versus, versus Kung Fu, you know? 
[03:17:00]  Like just your thing versus my thing and what I, what I trained for for years.  Like would he, would he put Sambo?  I think, I think, I think ours would win.  That's what I'm saying.  Would you put Sambo up against, would he put Sambo up against all of them?  Some smiles on the couch right now.  Yeah.  Sambo, uh, Sambo will win, right?  Um, this is not only, it's not only based on the, on the actual specialization and discipline, but also the, the, the athlete that's, that's practicing it. 
[03:17:30]  Right.  So, but, but Sambo is, is, is generally one of the most round, well-rounded, uh, disciplines out there.  I think Sambo is one of the most effective forms of fighting.  It's, it's one of the most effective forms of fighting.  Just, just top to bottom.  Did they teach that to the military?  Is that where?  Yeah, it's, it's actually, originally, it's, it's developed from, from the, there's, there's two different Sambo's.  It's Sambo and combat Sambo, which is the military sport that involves striking as well.  Is Sambo like a Kido's whiz made to get you out of there quickly? 
[03:18:00]  Like not, not play a biology?  Yeah, it's, it's, everything's designed to basically finish a flight as early as possible.  Right.  Right.  Right.  But if there's two athletes that are of, of, of equal level.  Yeah, it's, it's, everything's designed to basically finish a flight as early as possible.  Right.  But, if there's two athletes that are of equal levels, then, uh, then, uh, then, uh, it could, 
[03:18:30]  it could take a while.  I think, as far as I'm concerned, you're undefeated.  The one fight...  The one loss that Fedor took was 17 seconds into a fight.  It was an elbow to his forehead, which the doctor stopped the fight.  And you actually should have won because the elbow was illegal.  Are you bitter about that loss? 
[03:19:00]  Are you angry at that loss in your history?  No, absolutely not.  Now I'm not angry at that God doesn't do anything to the best.  No, I mean, today it really doesn't make a difference.  I mean, you know, whatever, it's God's will.  And, you know, unfortunately, it turned out as a technical loss, 
[03:19:30]  but it doesn't really bother me.  At that moment...  At that moment, it was a little uncomfortable because I was out of the tournament.  Yeah, I mean, at that point it was really upsetting  because it was actually part of a tournament.  So I was eliminated from that tournament because of that, you know, technical situation.  So he avenged that loss eventually.  And he also...  What's the hardest hit he's taken?  I'm going to guess the Kevin Randleman drop on the neck.  Is there any hit he's taken that's been harder than that? 
[03:20:00]  What's the hardest hit he's taken that's been harder than that?  What's the hardest hit he's taken that's been harder than that?  He thinks that it's because of Kevin Randleman, when he hit you on the shoulder.  Actually, one of the most dangerous hit he's taken was Fujita.  Yeah, I mean, I think, actually, one of the most dangerous punches that I took  is I missed a strike from Fujita when I was fighting him.  And, obviously, yeah, Kevin also, you know, that was dangerous because, you know, 
[03:20:30]  I could have landed the wrong one.  How did it feel when that seven-foot-four Korean fell on him?  Yeah, it felt like a big cement block.  It kind of just crushed me.  His forearm was on his face, and it covered his whole head. 
[03:21:00]  The guy's forearm.  Yeah, no, I just, I remember, you know, when I was down there, I was like,  okay, I got to get out of here because...  Because it hurts?  No, no, no, no, it didn't hurt.  It's just that I got the feeling that I was just kind of engulfed and, you know,  just covered by this guy. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, he was.  Dude, he, from the bottom, I don't know how, I mean, he's, that's what makes him such a good heavyweight  is that he's a big guy, really strong, but he's fast like a middleweight.  He's really fast.  That's just fast.  Did you fight Bob Sapp?  Is Bob Sapp a male boy?  No.  No, you never fought Bob Sapp.  Was he, is he in the same thing?  No.  Bob Sapp тогда не дошел до меня.  He's K1.  Yeah, Bob Sapp was in the same tournament as I was, but he lost to Krokop,  and so I met Krokop in the finals. 
[03:22:00]  Okay.  And how about, what's his name when he was in his prime?  I've never seen tape of him in Silver, not, not Anderson, but the other one.  Vendley Silver.  Vendley Silver didn't have a boy in Pride, right?  No, we just, you know, it didn't work out where we didn't get a chance to meet.  Does he, do you, do you like the UFC?  Or, I mean, because you guys have never got together.  You've never fought in the UFC ever, right?  You've never fought in the UFC, but you like it, if you wanted to fight it.  Yeah, I watched the UFC fights. 
[03:22:30]  It's, you know, it's interesting to watch some of their fights.  But, you know, with respect to the organizers of the UFC, you know,  we weren't able to come to terms on working together.  I saw the last Affliction pay-per-view, the Tim Sylvia fight.  I suggest if you get it, you watch all the fighters,  because a fighter fights tend to not go too long. 
[03:23:00]  You beat up Tim Sylvia the way Tim Sylvia would beat me up.  How did you destroy him as easily as you destroyed him?  Well, you know, with luck, you know, it was a quick fight.  I love all his modesty as he's beating the shit out of everybody in the world. 
[03:23:30]  He's like, you know, as I smash his skull.  I want to lucky somebody's ass like that.  Jesus, man, he's just like a nice guy that knows how to...  So, where did all...  Okay, so if you...  Because I'm not a nice guy, because if I knew this shit...  Like, if I knew how to fight...  If I knew how to fight, I'd just be an asshole.  I would just be an asshole. 
[03:24:00]  So, it's like...  If I knew how to fight...  What was your fuel as a kid...  Because I'm sure you train as a kid...  What was your fuel as a kid to even want to be this dangerous?  What's the fuel?  When you were young, why did you want to be such a strong,  such a good fighter?  What's the reason you had?  Kill people or something else?  Like, his drive, like, you know, what is it to...  Well, at the time, it was really more as an athlete. 
[03:24:30]  I just, I wanted to represent my country.  This was a sport, and I wanted to master that sport  so I could, you know, be on the national level  and be well-known as someone that was the best at that sport  and for his confidence.  Oh, because it's big in Russia.  It's as big as...  But he never had a day job, right?  He never did...  He never did...  Yeah, no, I didn't know. 
[03:25:00]  First, I was just, you know, I was fighting.  He's never had, like, a job, like, you know,  at a hot dog stand, soccer park.  He just said...  He just said first he was beef, he just beefed in general.  That's it.  No, I was just...  I was a trainer.  You know, I trained people how to fight.  And I would, you know, I worked in the sports club.  You know, just kind of...  Was he a fighter?  Like, in terms of someone bumping into him 
[03:25:30]  at the train station, fighter?  Drinking fighter?  At a bar, bar fight?  If you were in a club or a bar,  or someone with you...  Oh, Jesus.  If you were in a bar fight with him,  you were in a bar fight?  But not now, it's...  No, it's not now, it's...  Not now, I'm talking about just when he was a...  Before he was a trained weapon.  Before he was doing it professionally, right?  Yeah, when he just was walking down the street.  Yeah, if you were just on the street and someone was angry with you,  did you fight with him? 
[03:26:00]  No, in fact, I didn't have such situations.  Before the army, I was, I think, young.  After the army, there were other guys.  So, everything was decided.  If there was some conflict, everything was decided.  No, I mean, I was pretty young,  and then I went into the army,  and I was just lucky not to really get into  any confrontations.  And once I got into the army,  it was dealt with differently there.  When is the last time you got beat up?  I mean, it's obviously not professionally.  Was it when you were in the army?  Was it when you were a teenager? 
[03:26:30]  When you were in the army when you were in the army when you were in the army?  Well, a couple of hours ago, my friend beat me in chess.  Oh, you like chess?  But, uh...  That's the other national thing.  Yeah, Jimmy's a big chess guy. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, like, big Bobby Fischer fan.  Yeah.  No, I'm kidding.  Physically.  It's good.  It's good.  What's wrong with you?  Well, who...  Bobby Fischer, you love me?  Who do you think is the next guy beside you?  Who's coming up now that is going to be the next Fedor?  Who do you think is the next guy beside you?  Who will be the next Fedor?  I don't know.  I don't think about it.  I think someone will change me.  I don't know.  I don't really think about it. 
[03:27:30]  Maybe it will be soon.  But, uh...  You know, I know somebody will replace me at some point.  I just, you know...  Maybe it'll be soon.  Maybe it'll be quite later.  Then you have a brother, too.  You have a brother?  You have a brother fighting?  Yeah, brother fights, but...  He fights slowly.  Yeah, yeah, he fights.  He's really good, too, though, right?  Yeah, he's a good fighter, right?  Good.  Yeah, yeah, very talented.  Yeah.  Are you training him? 
[03:28:00]  Are you helping him out?  Maybe to get into MMA?  Does he work?  It was a time when we worked together.  Now he's been working for a couple of years.  He's been working for a couple of years.  He's been working for a couple of years.  He's been working for a couple of years.  He's been working for a couple of years.  Yeah, there was a time when we trained together,  but now he lives in a different city.  He lives in St. Petersburg,  and he has different trainers,  and he trains on his own.  Right.  I saw footage of you training.  It was outdoors,  and then you were doing some wrestling moves,  and it looked like it was almost in a little schoolhouse.  It was bare bones, not at all fancy. 
[03:28:30]  It was very, very low budget.  Do you kind of train like that on purpose?  It was a simple place,  like a small school.  And did you train specifically like that,  without great beauty and everything?  It was on the street?  No, I've been training all the time.  It's my hometown.  No, it's where I've trained all my life.  It's my hometown.  It's basically the gym that I grew up in, 
[03:29:00]  and that's where I prefer to train.  And he doesn't do like a lot of MMA fighters in the UFC,  or these guys are just shredded.  They go on these diets,  and they protein drinks and all that.  I mean, he doesn't do any of that.  He eats what he wants.  He trains hard,  and he pretty much is what he is, right?  I don't think your fortune's in the ring. 
[03:29:30]  are really dependent on all these gimmicky things  that people do.  I think it's, in the first place,  it depends on the internal character,  from the faith in yourself,  the faith in God, 
[03:30:00]  and from the work that a athlete does,  and not from what a tablet he eats.  No, I believe that instead of what pill you take  or anything else,  it really more depends on  what you've got inside of you,  your determination,  your heart,  your belief in yourself  and in God,  and your training,  as hard as you work  to get to where you need to be.  So I'd never make it in MMA,  is what he's saying?  He's never laughed harder, Bobby. 
[03:30:30]  I could translate that one.  Do you think you could train a guy like this  to be a fighter?  Or at least a man?  Sam, show him your body.  Please.  He said,  of course,  I can train anybody.  You could train some really.  Really?  Well, there's one thing about, you know, 
[03:31:00]  working to have some serious results,  and then the other thing is just training  to at least, you know,  get to a certain level where you're considered.  How hard would it be to put a rare naked choke  on this chinless ass right here?  Could you just slip right out of it? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As long as the head is on something,  I'll find it.  Yeah, it's very weak.  It's very bash.  You're going to put a chin lock with no chin.  What do you do, dude,  other than this?  Do you roll with him?  I am also his attorney.  Oh, really?  You're a liar.  You're a translator.  For M1 Global,  it's the promotional company  that promotes fame.  Yeah, fuck yeah. 
[03:32:00]  M1 Global.  It's going to be a hell of a pay-per-view.  Do you fight?  No.  Do you just wear cool sweaters?  It's cold, man.  I'm from L.A.,  so I had to bust out the sweaters.  And you only take 2% from him, right?  Yeah.  I'm on salary.  So, Arlovsky,  I mean, it's kind of hard to picture  anybody having a chance  in a fight against you.  I mean,  you've never fought Arlovsky before,  I don't think.  What is it that makes this guy  ready to fight you?  It's hard to imagine  if someone can win you.  But Arlovsky never fought with you. 
[03:32:30]  And he feels like  he has a chance to win.  What do you think?  Well, how do you think  that Arlovsky  and he says  that he's ready for this fight?  Well, of course,  any chance  has a chance.  Yeah,  any fighter has a chance.  I mean,  you know,  anybody can realize  their best potential  in a fight.  I like Andrei  very much as a fighter. 
[03:33:00]  He's very well-rounded.  He's got really quick hands.  Is he on the upswing?  Because he had  some real heavy momentum  for a minute  when he used to wear  his fang teeth  and all that stuff.  and he seemed to be  the most dangerous dude  in UFC for a minute.  And then he lost to Silva.  What's his status now  in terms of  should he be fighting  Fedor right now  or is it like  he's lucky to be fighting Fedor?  How did he say 
[03:33:30]  today?  At one point,  he was very dangerous  when he was in UFC  but then he lost to Silva.  But how did he stay?  Did he deserve  or did he win?  Well, of course.  He's one of the most dangerous  fighters in the world.  No, absolutely.  I mean,  he's won his last couple fights.  in a row  and he's one of the most  dangerous fighters in the world  so he definitely deserves  to be in the world.  I mean,  everybody's dangerous.  I mean,  you know what I'm saying?  Everybody's dangerous  but it's like,  okay,  like Tim Silva,  he was riding,  Sylvia,  he was riding high  after he beat Arlovsky  or even like, 
[03:34:00]  what's,  Rampage.  Rampage was riding high  after he beat,  who did he beat  when he was riding high?  Oh, Liddell.  Chuck, right.  So that's what I'm saying.  Is Arlovsky on this thing now,  like how Frank Mir is on  where he just wanted  now it's time to see him  right,  you know.  Where is Arlovsky as he...  I think that Andre's career 
[03:34:30]  is only up.  No, I think,  he's definitely on the rise.  You know,  he fought on the same card  as Fedor fought  when he fought Sylvia  and he looked great.  Right.  And he won his next fight  after that.  He's a bad-looking dude.  And he's a bad-looking dude, like...  And he's a...  You know,  and he wears his little fangs  and stuff.  He's a bad-looking dude, you know.  That's what I'm saying.  It's just like...  Even if you know how to fight,  you look at a dude like Arlovsky,  he just looks...  just dangerous. 
[03:35:00]  He just looks dangerous.  And it's just like...  Does that have any...  Like, what does he do  to talk to himself  to go,  this dude looks dangerous  and he is dangerous,  but I'm dangerous, sir.  No, I don't even think about it.  I don't think  whether I'm dangerous, sir,  or...  I just go along.  You know what I'd like to see? 
[03:35:30]  Would you ever fight  a guy like Gabriel Gonzaga?  Would you ever see yourself...  Because he impressed everybody  when he beat Cro Cop  with that kick to the head.  I mean, that was devastating.  You ever see yourself fighting him?  He's a guy I kind of like.  A guy like Gabriel Gonzaga.  He looked very beautifully  when he beat Cro Cop.  Do you think he'll have a fight with him?  Well, if he's going to be with him,  I'll be killed.  And what do you know about him?  Unfortunately, not a lot. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, honestly,  I don't know that much about him,  but if it comes down to it  where somebody can organize  a fight with me and him,  then I'd be more than happy  to fight him.  Did he ever fight somebody  that just stunk?  That's what I'm going to ask him.  You know what I mean?  That just made him want to puke  because it was like,  oh, it just smells.  Oh, smell literally.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't mean...  Smell literally or just stunk?  Yeah, smell both.  Well, you have to hit mine and his.  No, he's not going to say it.  No, there's some guys  that really, guys don't want to fight  because they stink.  I don't know how to say 
[03:36:30]  I don't know how to say  I don't know how to say seaweed in Russian.  I don't know how to say seaweed.  I don't know how to say seaweed in Russian.  What's up?  Smell like miso soup.  Don't cook soup in your sushi.  Oh, he added sushi.  I didn't know how to say seaweed in Russian.  I don't know how to say seaweed in Russian.  How do you say seaweed? 
[03:37:00]  I don't know.  I don't say sea.  Without just one good,  one good,  like just one mean answer.  Without the modest,  we know he's a modest, nice dude, right?  Yeah, we know.  But really,  just a really dude answer.  Who is an overrated bop?  Well, tell us honestly,  who in this sport  didn't deserve to be  on the level he got?  Well, some guy who's not so good  but people think he doesn't.  If Rick Ross comes out of his mouth,  I'll laugh. 
[03:37:30]  I know he's a nice guy.  I know he's nice guy.  He's a respectful guy.  But who is just like,  in his words,  he's like,  just man,  I'd like to just show everybody  that he stinks.  If there's a guy who just wanted to show  that he's just smart,  he's just not good.  You're tiring him out.  I'm sorry.  Well, if a person takes a line  in the ratings,  then it's the same people  who put it and chose it.  I don't judge the players. 
[03:38:00]  I take everything like this.  Well, I mean,  you know,  if some guy's in the ratings  pretty high,  and that means just people  put him there.  It doesn't mean necessarily  that he belongs there,  but I don't really judge people.  So if some guy's in the ratings  and I got to meet with them  and to prove that I'm better,  then I will.  But I'm not here to judge  whether or not  he deserves to be there.  Ask him if Bas Rutan  was at his peak today,  would he be one of the  baddest motherfuckers out there?  Oh, you know.  Without cursing,  because he's a...  Oh, sorry. 
[03:38:30]  Baddest person on the planet.  Praise God.  Praise God.  Well, the fact that he was  a UFC champion  already speaks volumes.  That's it?  That's all I need to say.  Okay.  Do you think that  in an attempt to make  MMA bigger here,  like they're pushing 
[03:39:00]  certain guys through faster,  like Brock Lesnar  had like, what,  four fights before  he got a shot  at the championship?  He's a great fighter,  but he only had four fights.  Or Kimbo Slice  was made this household name  before he had ever  proven himself  in mixed martial arts.  Is that just an attempt  to make MMA bigger?  How do you feel about that?  How do you feel about that?  How do you feel the fact  that there are so many players  like Lesnar and Kimbo Slice  where they don't have so many  fights,  but they're pushing them  very quickly.  And do you think  that it's because  people want the sport  of MMA  to grow faster than they're ready? 
[03:39:30]  How do you feel?  How do you feel about that?  There are people  from the fact that  there are so many players  who have been  even after four fights  after four fights  who are already  one from the best?  There are some players,  who are  with their talent.  They are with some  abilities.  There are of course  who want to see  And from that, they turn around and they take their speed faster than those who start to beat up from the bottom. 
[03:40:00]  and so they're kind of put on a faster track.  And, you know, if it's good for the sport, that's fine. 
[03:40:30]  So what do you do?  Do you train, they say, what, two or three times a day you train?  And how far before a fight do you actually stop?  Do you give yourself a day or two before a fight  where you do very light training?  I mean, because I've read two or three times a day.  You train two or three times a day.  But when you stop before the fight,  a week before the fight or a day before the fight,  when you stop training two or three days,  like you usually train before the fight.  Yeah, about ten days before the fight, 
[03:41:00]  I'm basically done with my training.  The training's the hardest part.  How come he fights every New Year's?  Because they ask me to.  That's it?  They invite me to.  All right.  Is he bummed out that Pride is gone?  I mean, I know it's Dream now, but does he miss Pride?  I understand that now there's a dream, yes.  Are you afraid that Pride doesn't exist?  And how does it exist?  Well, of course, Pride has been a role in MMA in the world of MMA. 
[03:41:30]  And I think he's done a lot for the development of this sport.  Yeah, no, it's disappointing because, you know,  Pride had its place in not only the MMA world, but also its history.  And it contributed a lot to the growth of MMA.  So it's sad to not see it exist.  Because the Japanese fans, performing in front of them,  they're really respectful.  They don't scream out.  They, you know, it's a different atmosphere performing in Japan 
[03:42:00]  than it is performing in Anaheim, California,  with a bunch of savages who just drank a six-pack in the parking lot.  Because it's different from when you were in Pride.  The Japanese fans, they have a lot of respect,  such good boys, but it's a difference between being in Anaheim,  where people just drank a lot of beer and cry like crazy.  Say it right.  I wasn't bad.  Dude, you really are making us nervous because...  One slip and we can all be good.  It's just, I'm trying to...  You're just saying stuff. 
[03:42:30]  You really are improv in this thing, and it's...  Since we heard sushi, we had a great trouble.  He's just a...  He's an actor.  We're big fans of this.  He has a stare, like, that you go, you just wanna go.  And then you wanna say to...  You wanna say to Faito, with all due respect.  And then you wanna say to these dudes, all due respect.  They just don't want to say that I'm not saying the word right,  because, you know, you're so smart, 
[03:43:00]  and then, more importantly, you have four boys behind you,  who are sitting there, who are also angry at me.  But Trace, he gives them first shot.  He gives them first shot before he even starts to do it.  Who are these guys?  He gives them a lot more time to beat you, than he will.  They will deal with you.  They better not hurt them,  because they're so angry, that they don't even go to the ring.  Yeah, honestly, you really shouldn't piss those guys off,  because they're such angry people, they don't even let them into the ring.  Excuse me for a second.  Is this your family?  Is this relatives?  Is that your relatives? 
[03:43:30]  It's like four or five guys on the couch.  My trainer, Voron Vladimir Mikhailovich.  Yes, one of them is my trainer, Vladimir Mikhailovich Varanov.  He looks fun.  He's waiting to have somebody beat up right now.  He looks like he's waiting to have somebody beat up right now.  Trainer.  Vadim Finkelstein is my manager.  The Finkelstein?  Finkelstein?  Of course.  Which one's that?  Can I pick which one that is? 
[03:44:00]  They really do rule the world, don't they?  Yes, the Finkelstein.  Of course.  Good Lord.  Of course.  Finkelstein?  We all got something in common, all of us.  All right, go ahead.  Finkelstein?  Who's the other?  These are all my friends,  but the two guys are my friends, Slava and Dennis.  Is he a fan of Yakov Smirnov?  He's nice, Yakov Smirnov.  No, Russians don't know who he is.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and that's really good to know.  Does he like comedy? 
[03:44:30]  Like, who's his favorite comedian?  Actors.  Wait, there's no word to say comedy in Russian.  Stand-up comedy?  Stand-up comedy?  But what's his favorite movie?  What do you want to date him?  What kind of question is that?  I just want to know.  So when I watch him on TV,  I can say,  you know,  his favorite movie is... 
[03:45:00]  What's some of your fears?  One of his favorite movies is Die Hard with Bruce Willis.  All right, see, there you go.  He lives in my building.  Now, Jimmy will repeat that every cheeky means.  I say hi to me, ignores me.  That's no part of me.  Who lives in your building?  Tell him I say hi.  I'm a big fan.  Tell him it's amazing, dude,  because we are big fans.  And not because you're sitting here. 
[03:45:30]  He's the real dude.  We're just like,  he's the baddest dude walking around, man,  for real.  And to show our respect for you,  you can take Sam with you.  He's yours.  That's the boy.  We're giving you a slave.  We're giving you an American-human slave.  Do we have to wrap?  Okay, we have to...  We've got a promotion.  It's this Saturday night.  It's called  It's Affliction,  A Day of Reckoning.  And we have... 
[03:46:00]  We'll do the read after.  Yeah, but we got something going on tomorrow,  I do believe.  What do you got tomorrow?  Like a Tuesday Trump Tower atrium?  Yeah, we got a press conference tomorrow  for the Affliction M1 Global  Day of Reckoning show.  It's open to the public, right?  It's open to the public, I believe.  And Tito Ortiz is going to be there.  Oscar De La Hoya is going to be there.  Fedor, of course.  Nice.  It's going to start at 10.30 tomorrow  at the Trump Tower atrium.  And he is fighting  Andre the Pitbull Arlovsky.  That's the headline fight  this Saturday.  But it's a great car. 
[03:46:30]  I mean, there's a lot of great fighters on it.  But I would suggest watching the whole thing.  You don't want to just tune in at the end.  Just watch the whole thing.  No, definitely watch the whole thing.  Definitely watch the beginning.  One of the first undercard fights on HGNet  is baby Fedor, Fedor's protege.  He's a 20-year-old kid.  That's what I was trying to get at.  I forget.  Yeah.  Nice.  The whole card's great.  The next Fedor.  Let's get him out of here.  Let's hear it for Fedor, everyone.  He's got a nice live audience.  Thank you, guys.  We're going to take a quick break  and we'll wrap up next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:47:00]  Wow.  I must say,  we've had a lot of scary dudes in this studio.  We just saw the scariest.  No offense to some of the other tough guys  that have been in here,  but that Fedor,  you felt like something could happen  at any moment  because he doesn't speak English.  So you're just praying  that the fucking translator  was going to say the right thing  and not slip up with his translation  because maybe he's hungover or something.  I've only met Randy Couture.  I've only met Randy Couture 
[03:47:30]  when he was in here.  He understands sarcasm.  He just gets it.  Remember when we went to Amsterdam?  Foreigners sometimes  don't get American sarcasm.  That sarcasm shit?  And I'm trying to say,  look,  I'm trying to say  that he doesn't look dangerous.  He just looks like a...  Who, that guy?  Like an average-sized dude.  He doesn't look like,  holy shit.  Andre Olovsky,  when you see him,  you're like,  this motherfucker looks dangerous.  He's just a big...  And Brock Lesnar. 
[03:48:00]  He looks dangerous.  This guy looks...  He had his nice little sweater on.  His little winter sweater.  Even when he's fighting,  I always look at Fedor and go,  how is this guy...  He's kind of not  the way the other dudes are.  He had a seriousness to him.  It's in his eyes  because when you look at him,  he's got big hands  and there's almost  an odd gentleness to him  when he's talking  and that's because  he doesn't need to talk shit.  He's such a devastating fighter.  He doesn't need it.  You find yourself 
[03:48:30]  stop breathing  until he smiles  and then you breathe again.  That didn't make me  feel any better.  He looked like he was smiling  as he's murdering you.  And Patrice,  you nailed it with me.  I was thinking,  how can I mess with him  in a way  where it'd be cool?  You would've fucked  everybody up, man.  No, I was like,  I'm out.  I had no problem  admitting it.  I'm like,  I'm out.  I wanted to write you a letter  and say,  don't do it  and hold it up.  Don't do it  and push that boring button  so that this guy can go  I'm not that boring. 
[03:49:00]  I'm like,  I would've fucking walked out.  I would've walked out.  Those four guys on the couch  were intimidating as fuck.  Well, once I found out  it was Finkelstein  and everything  and helped,  it certainly helped.  Finkelstein,  the Jew lawyer,  he's like,  oh,  we all have something in common.  Yeah,  that fucking helped us.  He's a very quiet dude.  That's just the way  he looks in the ring.  He doesn't show  a lot of emotion.  It's like he never  looks afraid.  He never looks at you.  This guy has never  lost a fucking fight.  But the thing is, 
[03:49:30]  he just lost  his Sambo tournament.  That's why you were  bringing that up.  I didn't want to bring it up.  Well, not that one.  I'm talking about  the one in 2000.  He just lost this year.  He lost Sambo this year.  Who beat him?  I don't know who beat him.  But not in MMA?  No, Sambo,  which is actually  probably more important  to him than...  Okay.  But he lost this year,  which is kind of fucked up.  Really?  Yeah, but I wasn't  bringing it up.  Is it on YouTube?  It's got to be somewhere.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  Patrice is a translator's  worst nightmare.  You were going to  screw it all up. 
[03:50:00]  Look it.  If this motherfucker  didn't...  How about that motherfucker  throwing sushi at us?  That's what I'm saying.  We said that the big,  giant Korean  smelled like sushi?  No, we didn't,  you motherfucker.  Say it right,  you goddamn translator.  We said dog and cat.  Say it.  Yeah.  My God.  His favorite...  And you and Rocky 4,  he didn't even get the reference  of like why that would mean anything to him.  He answered it seriously.  No, I do not like Rocky.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  I wanted to hear 
[03:50:30]  who he doesn't like.  Like, all right,  who's fucking...  Who do you fucking...  Who don't you like?  Give us some wrestling shit.  He's like a quiet dude.  That's not his nature.  His nature is to just be,  oh, he's a good fighter.  This is the thing.  And then punch your face off  and break your arm.  But that's...  But see,  this is the...  That's the thing about,  I guess,  when you're...  When it's real fighting.  But boxing has that...  That...  That...  That...  Pageantry, right?  Yeah.  Where...  They need...  They need more like a...  They need more Quentin Rampage.  Jackson,  they need more dudes...  More Liddells and more... 
[03:51:00]  Who talk shit.  Who go,  I don't like this motherfucker's haircut.  Like Tito.  Yeah.  Tito Ortiz.  And Liddell said that.  He goes,  Tito's afraid of me.  I mean,  Liddell has said that  that Tito's afraid of him.  And I mean,  he's...  We understand this quiet  fucking monster,  but it's like,  give me something,  give me like...  I'll kill you.  Not me,  but fucking Andre Olofsky.  Like,  just go,  yeah,  I don't like his dumb teeth  that he puts in his mouth.  Or just something that wears...  Like,  it makes it theatrical.  It makes it like,  oh shit,  I want to watch this.  He's been fighting in Pride, 
[03:51:30]  which is a totally different organization  that they respected.  The fans respect.  They don't boo.  They don't do weird shit.  And the fighters  all respected each other.  UFC is more...  They added that shit into the mix.  Americans like that stuff.  Over in Japan,  they don't like the...  Well,  I was over there.  It gets a lot to be loud in public.  You know what I mean?  There's weird rules of...  Really, it's...  I'll be in danger.  You'd be kicked out of the country  at the airport.  After meeting him, though, 
[03:52:00]  looking at...  That dude is a...  He's just a dangerous dude, man.  That is just...  You see,  his eyes are kind of half-squish.  I wanted to do the stare down with him.  I wanted to do that.  Oh, we forgot to do that.  I know.  I should have asked at the end.  He probably would have just  given me a little look.  You know, he's like...  Nah, he would have done it.  So, what do we got, Jimmy?  We've got to do the live read officially.  If he misunderstood stare down  Well, I would say  please don't pummel me again.  Yeah.  As he pumbles him.  I hate to be pummeled.  Pumbles and crumbles.  I would never...  You ever use the word pummel? 
[03:52:30]  No, no one ever has.  It doesn't exist.  I've pummeled a couple kids  in junior high.  Why don't we do a little...  We've got to do a live read  for the pay-per-view.  Hey, can I have a banana?  Can I have one of those?  Yeah, you should.  The way you talk,  that's what you should eat  with your feet, stupid.  Following the success of...  This is the live read for reflection.  Following the success  of their initial MMA event,  Affliction Entertainment  returns with Affliction M1 Global  Day of Reckoning.  It's live on pay-per-view  this Saturday, January 24th.  9 o'clock.  It's from Anaheim.  It's 6 o'clock on the West Coast. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  It's an explosive six-fight  MMA pay-per-view event.  And it's going to be headlined,  of course,  by the great Fedor Emelianenko.  He's going to defend  his World Alliance  of Mixed Martial Arts  heavyweight's belt  against world top-ranked  heavyweight Andre the Pitbull  Orlovsky.  I'm rooting for Andre.  What?  Me too,  to make it through  the first round  so you don't spend  this much money  and watch 10 seconds  of fight.  Every fight on there  is really fucking good.  I don't think  Andre Orlovsky  is going to go down  in one round  or anything like that.  Fedor's thing is,  though,  he just knocks you down  and then he's an 
[03:53:30]  amazing submission guy.  I mean,  he's just...  He's an amazing  submission guy.  He doesn't make it pretty.  He doesn't make it pretty.  I just can't even imagine.  I know.  They just twist your arm  back and you tap  and that's it.  Oh, please.  This blockbuster pay-per-view  also features  MMA all-star  Josh Barnett  as he takes on  the experienced  Gilbert Ivelle.  Other fighters  featured on the card  are Matt the Law  Lindland.  Did I say it wrong,  Ivelle?  Well,  someone's going to  get pummeled.  Somebody's going  to get pummeled.  This card includes  Matt the Law,  Lindland,  Renato, 
[03:54:00]  Babalu,  Sabrell,  Chris Horidecki,  and Dan Lauzon.  The event is presented  by Golden Boy Promotions,  Affliction Entertainment,  and its partners,  Donald Day,  Trump,  and M1 Global.  Affliction M1 Global  Day of Reckoning.  It's a live on  pay-per-view.  It's again from Anaheim  this Saturday,  January the 24th  at 9 o'clock.  Contact your  pay-per-view provider,  your cable people.  It's very easy to guess.  What are they doing  tomorrow?  Tito Ortiz is probably  announcing that he's  got a big fight  coming up.  Well,  he's not with anybody  right now.  I bet he's got  a big announcement. 
[03:54:30]  Hopefully we'll make it  on our show.  That'd be cool.  So he beat Noguera  in 2004?  Yeah.  Which Noguera is that,  though?  That's Minotaur, right?  Ted Noguera.  I don't know.  They're twin brothers,  and they fight.  Let's get out of here.  Mone has a big scar  on his back.  We did good today.  Yeah.  I want to thank  Patrice O'Neal  and Robert Kelly  for stopping in  with your knowledge.  I didn't realize  you knew that much.  Bobby knows a lot  about fucking MMA.  Pretty cool.  For the people  that are going to  stick with us  until Ron and Fez  do their noon to three, 
[03:55:00]  Bob May died  over the weekend.  Who's Bob May?  He was the man  inside the robot outfit  in Lost in Space.  If you remember,  Big Cab,  this is a legendary bit,  was at a convention  and got Bob on the phone,  and we played  the silent game  with this guy.  Well,  he's now dead.  Jeffrey Ross was in studio.  We're going to replay that  in honor of him dying,  I guess.  I don't know.  We're going to start  that in a couple minutes here.  Warning!  He was the voice, too?  Or he just was the dude  in the suit?  We get into that whole thing.  That's like saying 
[03:55:30]  a guy who was in  Barney's suit died.  I think we learned  that he wasn't the voice.  He was just  in the fucking suit.  I think.  He had to be warning, too.  I don't know if he was warning, too.  Warning.  If he wasn't warning or danger,  fuck Bob May.  He wore a suit.  I think that's the beauty  of the bit you're about to hear.  Yeah.  I think that was it.  Patrice.  He didn't even get  to do warning.  The guy that was  Big Bird's chest.  Yeah.  He snuffled up  because the front part 
[03:56:00]  of his face died.  Yes.  Really?  Everybody can imitate  warning,  but he wasn't allowed to do it.  This guy was  Gordon's balls.  Right.  Right.  So that's for the people  sticking around.  And that will be brought  to you by DirecTV.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  DirecTV.  888-961-DIREC-TV.  Fucking Bob May.  Want to thank  13-year-old JC  for stopping by.  We didn't get to you  over here, JC,  but I hope you had fun.  Your mom's hot.  We all know that.  The Annette Bening 
[03:56:30]  looking broad.  That's JC's mom.  Yeah, she is.  She's a lawyer, too.  Whatever.  All right.  What else is there?  Jimmy's going to be  doing the comedy festival  in Miami,  which is a really fun festival.  What are you working?  Jackie Gleason Theater,  the big one?  No, no.  It's Lincoln Theater,  probably.  No, it's a big one, too.  It's a few hundred seats.  I'm not going to sell it out.  Like I said,  it's not that big,  but it's going to be  a fun time.  It's awful.  I think you're coming back  to do the whole show  when Jimmy's gone.  I think so.  One of these days.  We're trying to figure that out.  Patrice,  what do you got going on? 
[03:57:00]  Just tired.  Well, eat some meat.  Yeah, get some meat in your face.  Get some protein.  You fucking had dirt tea  for fucking breakfast.  Patrice, you know I support you,  but how you were talking  about that Brazilian meat house,  I'm like,  there's no way  this is going to last.  I'm trying to be healthy.  I think I'm going to make it through.  Good.  Exactly.  Call me when you crack.  We'll go over there  and have some fucking steaks.  Let me be there for that.  You're just going to stick a fork  in some hardened animal fat.  Just eat it.  Some garlic steak. 
[03:57:30]  It's a garlic steak.  Oh, how good is that?  What's the steak  that there's like three of them  on one and they go small?  God, is that the best?  Picanha steak  is the best steak.  What's the name  of this shitty restaurant?  You've been there.  Plataforma.  Manny, many years ago.  The best restaurant  in New York City.  50 bucks ahead.  Number one  rated cleanliness.  You drop a napkin,  there's five guys there.  In the fucking New York City.  Plataforma.  49th Street?  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  They have the dessert tray  that goes around. 
[03:58:00]  Patrice would stick  his finger in  every dessert  and go,  what's this?  Everybody cracks up  when he does it.  I did it with my wife  trying to fucking imitate him.  I got in trouble.  They kicked you out, right?  They pulled the tray.  Don't do that.  No, don't.  Yeah, you just do the...  He sticks his finger  in all of them.  This one here,  what is it?  You just swirl your hand around.  You know why?  Because he's fun.  You're a charmless ox.  I really am.  And my wife said,  don't try to be Patrice.  I was like,  fuck you, fucking...  That hurt. 
[03:58:30]  Twat.  That's right.  It was true, though.  Bob has no charm at all.  I have nothing.  Bob's got fucking  dead black doll eyes  and all this is mean shit.  Fucking creep.  You have fade or eyes  and fucking  puff and stuff body.  You make everybody sick.  I'm not fucking fat anymore, stupid.  Shut up, gross burger.  Take your shirt off.  Shut up, burger.  You know what?  I can't even roll with you.  You can't tease a man  for his past fatness.  Sure you can.  As if it's still exist.  And his future fatness.  He's lost at least  a hundred fucking pounds.  Yes, he has.  Bob looks very good. 
[03:59:00]  I've told Bob...  75 fucking pounds?  75.  I was 280.  He was my fattest.  If you go to my MySpace  and you can see me  last December  and it just looks like  me inside of somebody else.  Bob is after.  In a fat suit.  That's his new nickname.  After Kelly.  I don't got any of that  flabby skin, thank God.  Well, he wasn't stretched out  long enough.  Was that it?  Dude, I was putting on  firming cream  like a 13-year-old  every day.  You had roundness to you.  You weren't obese. 
[03:59:30]  You just had gave up  and you're back to fucking...  You're not as beautiful  as you used to be  but you fucking...  You look good, man.  I'm in spitting distance.  Bobby was beautiful.  You've seen young pictures  of Bobby Kelly.  That's when I met him.  Yeah.  You were like 160.  No, I mean when he had  all his fucking hair  and everything.  I met him with his hair  and everything.  185 was my lowest weight.  Really?  Yeah, it was good looking.  Fucking...  And your woman's  working out with you too, right?  Yeah, I told her to go work out.  I go, look,  I'm getting my shit together.  So you better get  your shit together.  She was with you 
[04:00:00]  and you were a manatee  so you got to give her...  You got to give her  a little bit of fucking room.  Don't be fucking  pressing her like that.  Yeah, come on.  She looks good.  But your woman  keeps looking good anyway.  Yeah, she's like one of those...  Women though,  like certain women,  they just don't get fat.  They, you know,  make sure boobs get big  and whatever.  She's got that fucking  Everett, Massachusetts body.  That, you know,  like little...  And I hate your body,  Norton, by the way.  Good.  I don't want you  liking my body.  I just don't like...  I just don't like someone  who's out of shape  but they're not fat.  Yeah. 
[04:00:30]  Wow, someone really  liked that one.  He knows the deal.  I just don't want  to look at you  with your horrible figure  but you're not fat.  I'm good from the waist down.  I'm in very good...  I have very solid,  muscular legs.  You look like  you're made of clay.  If I put you  in a sand timer,  you could go  right through.  No, I wouldn't.  If I was upside down,  I would get stuck  at the top.  My legs are good.  You're not going  to sell me out  of my legs.  I'll never bam out  the gams.  He's got the bowling pin calves.  I have solid fucking calves. 
[04:01:00]  You want to check them out?  I have great gams.  Show them your calves.  Yeah, let's see the calves.  Why would you  warm just your legs out?  I don't just work them out.  It's a gift from God.  Let me see these legs.  Look at this calf of his.  You think he's kidding?  Now that's a calf,  my friend.  See?  Look at that.  All his muscles  are in his one calf.  You can see the blood  pumping through his calf.  That's why  the rest of his body...  I swear to God,  he looks like  an unfinished clone.  He really does.  This calf is like  a hard dick.  It takes all the nutrients  from the rest of his body. 
[04:01:30]  He's still in the Matrix.  His calf is horny.  He just...  All his blood...  Just pumping away.  Look at his light-headed.  Get this shit together.  Everybody is hating on my legs,  but I got good gams.  Don't be jealous.  Norton has some beautiful legs  I just saw.  I got beautiful legs.  He's got good calves.  I got great legs.  What's up with the upper top?  He just said,  fuck the torso.  I'll keep my underwear on.  I'll keep my underwear on.  Let's see the upper legs.  All right, let's go.  What are you doing?  I'm showing him.  I want to see his legs. 
[04:02:00]  I want to see the whole thing.  I'm not being creepy.  Let's see the legs.  Let me see these legs.  Is that right?  Let me fix that.  I'm not pulling the...  He's like adjusting his claw.  No, I'm just making sure.  I'm not going to be creepy.  I'm like your fucking  vacuum salesman belt.  Fucking...  Throw it on my belt.  Stinks.  Let me see these legs.  All right, let's go.  All right, just seeing your mule.  Look at his fucking mule.  Jesus.  He doesn't look pathetic.  He really doesn't.  He said he looks good  from the waist down.  He told you.  I mean, it's...  Solid. 
[04:02:30]  Very solid.  I got solid...  I got great legs.  I don't like how you have  hairy hamstrings.  Other than that,  sexy legs for Norton.  Yeah, he's got all right legs.  No, I got better than all right legs.  I got damn good legs.  Take that shirt off.  I'm a little mess up top,  but I could lose that.  That's easy.  How can you lose it?  Just stop eating bad.  He's getting there.  Not that bad.  Look at that.  Let me see.  No.  How can your legs look that good?  He doesn't squeeze his fat  and yelled at it lately,  so that's a good sign.  Yeah.  It's hard.  That's what men put it on.  We put it on our stomachs.  You're built like a stress doll. 
[04:03:00]  It's very hard.  The calves get the benefit of that.  Squeeze his stomach,  see if his eyes pop out.  Squeeze the rest of it.  The calves get the benefit.  Squeeze his midsection,  see if he fucking puts muscle  on his arm.  I happen to have  very good strong arms.  Let me see.  I'm not going to show you,  but you can feel them.  They're not going to show me.  They're all very strong arms.  Well, take the sweatshirt off.  I don't need to do all that, no.  But his legs,  I wouldn't blame you 
[04:03:30]  for being proud,  because I would think  you had little meatily legs,  but you don't.  No, I don't.  Very strong legs.  Not at all.  Got to get in.  I wear old school wrestling body suits.  That's what I wear out.  People are trying to get in shape.  I think this show's becoming  quite metrosexual on faggy.  Everybody's losing weight.  They're working the arms a little bit.  I mean, you were the faggiest eater,  OB, since day one.  Since that first coming,  you was eating fucking...  Yeah, but you know what?  Multi-grain fruit loops.  Dude, I'll tell you.  I had an uncle drop  dead of a heart attack 
[04:04:00]  before he was 50.  My dad had major heart problems.  So back in 93,  when he did his...  Why are we getting serious?  But when he had his  quadruple bypass surgery,  that was it for me.  I didn't know most of you guys  at that point.  I didn't know any of you guys  at that point,  and that's when I changed  my eating habits.  There you go.  That scared the shit out of me.  And you've been losing weight  for a while, Norton.  But before that,  it was fast food and all that crap.  After the holidays.  Yeah, holidays.  Bob, let me tell you  why Bob did it real righteously.  He fucking said,  fuck that.  He didn't make an announcement  because usually people  make an announcement  that they're going to do.  That's what I'm saying. 
[04:04:30]  I am a vegan.  I fucked up.  I should have just  kept it to myself,  but it was just out.  And then one day people go,  what's going on with you, Patrice?  You want people to ask you.  You don't want to make  the announcement.  Exactly.  So that was a disingenuous  thing I did,  but I just announced it,  whatever.  But Bobby didn't announce it.  He just came one day  fucking looking good  and healthy,  and I'm proud of Bob  because he was a fucking sad mess.  Yeah, it was bad.  The positive energy  you're throwing out right now  makes me want to step  on your fucking hat.  I'm saying Bobby came in.  I know.  Bobby had become so fat 
[04:05:00]  that,  how fat was he?  Yeah.  He couldn't get any fatter  for his body type.  And here's how evil  Bobby was when he was fat.  I was a 41 waist.  Jesus.  He would wonder  why people didn't tease me  for my fatness.  He would go tease him too,  but I just been,  I didn't let myself go.  My fatness has always been  a part of my problem.  You showed up fat.  My problem, yeah.  I showed up fat.  You came in a sex symbol.  Right.  You were like Tyra Banks.  You're like, 
[04:05:30]  where are they now?  And you just go,  oh my God, Bobby.  Yeah.  Like one of the Goonies.  Take us back to that.  When he first showed up  on the scene down at the cellar,  he was like the sex symbol.  And we and Patrice  knew each other back in Boston.  I knew it in Boston.  Bobby.  And you guys would roll your eyes  like this motherfucker.  Two most beautiful men  I've ever seen.  And without even  fagness involved.  A young Bobby Kelly, right?  Yeah.  Where you look at him  and go,  this guy is a beautiful dude.  But you know who trumped  his beauty as a man  and looked like a bitch?  Who? 
[04:06:00]  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo was a motherfucker.  You could fuck Nick DiPaolo  when he was younger  and you wouldn't be gay.  That's how beautiful Nick was.  You could actually go see a movie  like a drive-in with him  and suck his cock  and kiss his neck slowly.  I'm telling you  he looked like  what's the silent movie motherfucker?  Charlie Chaplin.  No.  Valentino.  Valentino  with makeup  and he used to  he had pictures where  like real faggy pictures  but he  but that's why Nick's so mean  because he was like  a beautiful woman.  That's how he got pussy.  He got,  pull your pussy out 
[04:06:30]  you fucking cunt.  And they'd be like  he used to have pictures  where half his jacket  was off his shoulder  and near his elbow.  You know those kind of pictures?  Yeah.  And he'd just look at you  With his tragedy  and comedy tattoo there?  Oh, that's horse shit.  I'm really into  what I do comedy.  I'm an artist.  Bitch.  Anybody that puts  a fucking comedy  that's like if I put  a carrot on my arm  and let you know  I'm serious about this  veganism you motherfucker.  But he, 
[04:07:00]  gorgeous  but Bobbo  in his fucking young days man  good looking dude  and then he just let go.  And it  I let go  You get a statement  I let go  when I  when I  when I fucking hurt my knee  man  but he was looking  Can I just say something  really quick though?  He was looking bad  He wasn't looking  sexy then either  Yeah  Not at all  Cause you know what happened?  Not at all  His the worst curse  worse than his fatness  His stupid hairdo?  He was going bald  Yeah  He was going bald  He had a full head of heaven  But I don't mind that  The knee really fucked me up 
[04:07:30]  But can I just say one thing  There was that one rap song  I broke my knee dude  I broke my knee man  I broke my knee dude  Love that  That  I listened to it the other day dude  That is a fucking good song  Who did that?

[04:16:30]  Look who's stopping by for a little visit today. Oh, yeah. Look at this.  Hickory dickory doo. I ain't written a new joke since 82. Oh, Jeffrey Ross in studio. How are you?  I'm great. You have the worst luck, and I'll tell you why. You always show up the day after  Ant and I do some just incredible, you know, blowout show the night before, so we're just 
[04:17:00]  hungover, tired. That's all you need, fresh blood. Right. Fresh attitude. We're so vulnerable  when you come in, because you always catch us when we're hungover. You don't look too bad.  We don't look bad? He looks like crap. Like 3.30, yeah. I was up so late. Wow, you went to  the Dice Show. Well, we hosted the Dice Show. He gave us some time up there, Jeffrey. I was  with Don Barris, one of his opening acts at 3 in the morning, getting wasted. Yeah. And Jim 
[04:17:30]  Norton, did he go on too? Oh, yeah. Jim Norton killed. Jim Norton killed. Norton's very funny.  Funny guy. I was at Game 5 of the World Series. You were there? Yeah. Oh, yeah. How was it? Yeah,  it was really exciting, man. It was really cool. How are you doing? It's exciting if you're a Yankee  fan. You know what? People hate hearing this, but I really love the Mets and the Yankees.  You're one of those guys. I saw a playoff game at Yankee Stadium. I rooted for the Yankees. I was  at Shea last night. The Mets were down. I rooted for the Mets. What's wrong with that? New York, 
[04:18:00]  New York. They named it twice. You got to commit to a team. Yeah, you really got to commit. It was all  about committing to a team for the Subway Series. I would get pissed when I'd walk down the street and you  see a store that says, go Yanks, and then in the other window, go Mets. Come on. Make  the choice. Oh, we got to talk to Brewer. He owes me $1,000, by the way. Yeah, is Brewer  calling us today? I don't know. He was too drunk last night. Yeah, Brewer called us really  late. He wasn't in his box seats. That was weird. No, he's in Montreal or something. Oh,  yeah. I usually see him at his box seats. He's got tickets. Jeffrey, we get back to the station 
[04:18:30]  like 1230 after the Dice Show, after watching the rest of the game, and we're just getting  our stuff to go our own ways and stuff. My phone rings, and it's Brewer just hammered  from Montreal talking about the Mets, and he promised he would call us today, but I don't  know what's going on with that. We got to bump you for a minute. No, you can actually help  us. We got to talk to the robot from Lost in Space. Oh, my God. Can I get some calls?  Is it the actual robot? No, it's the guy. It's Bob May, everyone. Bob May. You're on, 
[04:19:00]  Bob. Hello there. How you doing, Bob? Pretty good. Who is this? Anthony? Both of us are here,  Anthony and Opie. All right, Opie. Yeah. Now, you guys are coming over to see our show,  I hope. Oh, get the plug in right away. You're damn right. I'm not going to fool around,  you see, because my big friend is Big Kev. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, I mean, he's very good  with all the stars in Hollywood. Wait, I've just been informed you're not even the voice  guy. You're just a guy. No, wait. Let me explain everything. You're just the guy that was in  the robot? No, a guy. Listen to this. Wait a minute. I'm the actor who was the one that created 
[04:19:30]  the part. I did all the dialogue with Jonathan Harris, and in fact, there's some funny stories  about Jonathan and I. Oh, dear, I bet. Yes, yes. Oh, the pain. Dear boy. Now, Opie, I want  to hear a good... No, it's Anthony. I want to hear an imitation of Jonathan. He was just  doing it. Oh, that wasn't Jonathan. Shut up, you bubble-headed boobie. There's Jonathan.  Now, listen. No, the way it worked very simply is our announcer... You clattering clunk of 
[04:20:00]  collagenous junk. Well, don't forget bubble-headed boobie, please. I thought I just said that.  Oh, that... Well, never fear. Smith was there. Now, wait a minute. You did the trading, the  little banter with Jonathan Harris... All that on the soundstage, and weeks later in  post-production, our announcer would loop over the top of my line. So you're not even famous.  But you're not the guy. You're nobody. Hey, don't start with me, baby. I'm from New York.  I did Broadway. I wanted to hear the robot. What happened? Why can't we speak with the 
[04:20:30]  robot? All right, listen, guys. Yeah. I'm in Australia with our announcer. We're doing  a public appearance. And we're on the radio station with this DJ. And so Dick Tufelt, who  was our announcer, and I drove the poor DJ nuts because I said, warning. And he went, warning.  And the guy says, who the hell's doing this? So we did the whole show that way. 
[04:21:00]  Hello, that was a joke. Oh. Hey, guys, why don't you just save time and...  Can we just pass out some NyQuil around the studio? Where'd you find this guy? Did you  dig this guy? Hey, no, listen. You guys are big fans of Jonathan. And rightfully so. He's  a great guy. And what, did you ever see him touch young William? Well, I...  I was grabbing him from behind. Woo! We were doing a scene one day where Jonathan had  to polish the robot. Yeah. For a thing he lost his bet. Polish the robot. So he was polishing 
[04:21:30]  the robot. And I said, lower. And he got lower. And I said, lower. He got even lower. Finally,  he dropped his hand lower. And I went... I turned right around to him. And I said, I love  you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Wait, wait, Bob. I can't get past the fact that  you're not the guy. You're just... Yes, I am. So... You were just a guy in the suit. 
[04:22:00]  Don't start with me. Were you in the suit? Were you actually in the suit? Yeah. Now, are you  a man of short stature? Yes, I am. And how tall would you be? I am 5'6". Okay. And did  you move it around in there? Well, yeah. What's your claim to... I did everything with  it. In fact, Irwin Allen allowed Jonathan Harris and myself to create our own characterization.  Yes. What's your claim to fame? I mean, you didn't even walk. Oh, yes, I did. Was it on  a wheel thing? No. When it was in the full outfit, they pulled it with cables because the thing 
[04:22:30]  weighed 350 pounds. They pulled it with cables and we... And then sometimes I would carry  the top section, which weighed 250 pounds. I would carry that on a parachute-type harness.  And just when we thought we were a big deal, we're at the garden in front of 11,000 people.  Yeah. This shows how pathetic we still are. Yeah. I thought it... We can't even get the guy  that does the robot voice from Lost in Space. Who's his agent? Forrest Lawn? How old  is he? Oh, who is the agent? William Morris. That's Forrest Lawn. That's for damn sure.  But the actual William Morris. That's the guy. The guy. So, hey, what have you done lately? 
[04:23:00]  What have I done lately? Well, since Lost in Space, I did several Jerry Lewis films, of  course. Wow. There you go. That'll get you a few laughs. You're definitely Lost in Space.  Oh, I'm lost and you believe it. What do you ask a guy that was just in a suit and didn't  do the voice? Yeah. You ever fart in the costume? No, but I'll tell you this, Mark Goddard  and Bill Moomey locked me in there for lunch. Two things happened. Number one, my wife knew 
[04:23:30]  where I was every moment. And second of all, I had nothing else to do, so I lit up a cigarette  and I was smoking and Irwin Allen came on the set, saw smoke coming out of it, went for  the fire extinguisher. And it didn't happen, of course. But from then on, anytime smoke had  to come out of the robot, they handed me a cigar. You want really uncomfortable radio?  Yeah. Let's just not say anything anymore until he hangs up. Okay. Check it out with  Mark Goddard. All right. That's wow. What else could you tell us? What else can I tell 
[04:24:00]  you? As a robot, you know, I have a great memory because my computer banks will focus  on all different things. So now I have a memory of you guys and I expect to see your asses  out here at the convention. If you're not out here, I'll send Dr. Smith to do what he's  done to many of us. 
[04:24:30]  Now, since you have such a busy schedule and dialogue is at a rarity, I must go because  I've got to get down to the fans. But I really appreciate being on your show and I look forward  to you coming out and being on mine. All right, guys. And remember, if you want a star, get  a hold of Big Ken. Kev does it all. All right. Thanks. Hey, guys. It's Big Kev. I have never 
[04:25:00]  felt more like a met my entire life. My God. All right. Say something. Ping pong balls.  Anything. Whatever, Ben.  Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. 
[04:25:30]  Hello.  That is so uncomfortable. Oh, I am frigging sweating. I'm cringing. That is awful.  That's so uncomfortable.  Now, Big Kev's got to be like, no, the show, you know.  Sometimes the zipper would get stuck. Other times, one time I put the right leg on backwards 
[04:26:00]  and I had to start over again and put the left leg on. One time I was lost in Cleveland.  One time I was lost in Trenton, New Jersey. I'd never been lost in space. Not really. However,  there's actually two costumes. Fascinating. One I would make for public appearances. 
[04:26:30]  Dude, we had to do that same interview with the guys that were in the Star Wars suits. It's  like, what do you ask him? Yeah. When the movie came, uh, was, uh, the last movie came  out, Star Wars one, all the guys who are not in the most recent Star Wars movie were  here. Like Boba Fett, uh, the guy, the guy that was in R2D2, the guy that played Darth  Vader, the Wookiee and the Darth Vader guy. Right. And we didn't know what to ask him because 
[04:27:00]  they, all they were were the guys in the suits. And it turned out he was only the Darth Vader  one in the like third one. Like it wasn't even the first Darth Vader guy. It was like  the third one. Interesting enough. Interesting enough. The suits today are flame retarded. One  time I was smoking a cigar in between takes in between takes. It was episode number 72 where 
[04:27:30]  we get lost in space. And an ash fell on my leg. Now these suits today, they're, they're  flame retarded. But I lost a toe that day. Erwin Allen came over to me and said, where's  your toe? The great Erwin Allen. The great Erwin Allen. Not to be confused with Marty Allen,  Steve Allen, Herb Allen, Paul Allen. Burns and Allen. Burns and Allen. Allen or Allen. 
[04:28:00]  And then he has to go, well, uh, well, I gotta go. I gotta go. Wait, someone's pissed at us.  Come on. That was funny. Kathy, what's up? You guys are so mean. Oh my God. This guy has  the littlest claim to fame and, and you totally killed him. We thought we were getting the voice, 
[04:28:30]  you know, and do the voice. We thought we had the guy. Oh my God. That poor little old guy. Now he's  all upset and you guys are laughing. And then you try to make it up by saying, go see his show.  You guys are so mean. Oh my God. Shut up, Kathy. I would put one of my hooked hands in your ass.  Anyway, it was pretty funny though, listening to Jed's face. But at the same time, you guys are  mean. Love you. See ya. All right. Bye. He was lost in space. He was. A lot of people saying that. 
[04:29:00]  Hey, Dan, what's going on? Dan. Get Big Kev back on the phone, by the way. Dan. Yeah, I want to see  what the aftermath of that debacle was. Hello, Dan. You gone? All right. Well, Bob made the  guy that was in the robot suit. Big Kev is going to have to kill a few more children and  bury him in his basement to make up for the aggravation of that call. Yeah. I'll call you  Opie and you Anthony. And now I'm going to kill you. All right. Pete, what's up? Hey, the 
[04:29:30]  actual robot would be funnier than that guy. Well, possibly, yeah. I resent that. Anyway.  It's easy putting on that costume every day for 60 straight years. How many times can you  tell people how much it weighed and how many pieces it was in? When I see these actors like  Jim Carrey in his Grinch costume, it's reminding me of the day that Erwin Allen and I were lost 
[04:30:00]  in on the Jersey Turnpike going to this Fococca convention. I go, and one more guy calls me  Mr. Spock. And I go, I go, but you don't, you didn't even walk in the costume. Well, we  had a pulley system. No, he was in it. Cables would drag him around. And he's just standing  inside this thing. So it's not even like body mannerisms. What about the arms? They used  to wave around when he would go, warning, warning, warning. And then he would talk like, 
[04:30:30]  warning, warning. Hey, Smith, wax me. And then they'd have the guy overlay. Hey, Dr. Smith,  please shine my armor. But he'd be, ah. Classic. I had 15 minutes of fame. Unfortunately, my face  was covered. You know, why would you put yourself in that position? People are going to show up 
[04:31:00]  and go, wow, do the voice. Well, well, I don't do the voice. I don't do the voice. I was just  in the, in the suit. You know, every single person, every single person that goes there  that wants to see the robot is going to ask him to do the voice. And then, oh, I didn't  do the voice. But the costume weighed 500 pounds and it was pulled by a cable system. One time  I was smoking. They didn't, they didn't even trust me to walk. They had to pull me with  a cable. They pulled him with bullies. These kids today, Alf and Chewbacca, they don't know 
[04:31:30]  what it was like. Actors strike my ass. Byron Allen, Debbie Allen, Allen from Scooby-Doo  and I. Wow. Damn, that was so uncomfortable. Yeah. Hey, Jeffrey Ross in studio. Yeah. All  right. Let's take a break. We'll be back. The Opie and Anthony show successfully selling  hot dogs in the desert to cities all over the country. This hot dog is wet and it smells 
[04:32:00]  like tuna fish. Oh, gross. We got people that are trying to save gas and getting the  most out of their gas. Uh-huh. Listen to this that Danny found. We have reported on the  ways people are trying to beat the cost of gasoline from tinkering with their cars to  buying smaller ones. Tonight, a group of people who call themselves hyper milers. They are... 
[04:32:30]  Jimmy, are you a hyper miler? I was approached about hyper miling and I felt that there was  something kind of humiliating about it. Yeah. Not to me, but to those that were subjected  to watching hyper miling. Yeah. Yeah. I'll elaborate more in a minute. All right. Oh,  okay. Hyper milers. They are driven, if you'll excuse the expression. I won't. I won't excuse  it. See, they're driven. They are driven. Because, you know, it's a gas story. Oh, that's 
[04:33:00]  nice. You make 10 million a year and you're doing that. They are driven, if you'll excuse the  expression, to see how many miles they can get out of a gallon of gas. Our Bill Weir  has his eye on the gas game. Bill Weir. We'll ride with the hyper milers to see how they do  it. Take a spin with John Flory and you'll notice a certain... And you're going to want  to punch him in the head. John Flory. I can only imagine what John Flory's doing. I'm John 
[04:33:30]  Flory. That's right. And I'm hyper miling. Wait, is hyper miling... Strap in for some hyper miling.  Is that when they go really slowly? Dude, wait till you hear what this is about. I think  it's a bunch of things that they do to save as much gas as they can. So they could get  maybe an extra five miles of a tank of gas. Yeah, they just eke it out. And it's a big  hassle. Oh. To see how they do it. Take a spin with John Flory and you'll notice a certain 
[04:34:00]  focus. Beautiful neighborhood. Beautiful downhill too. Forget the houses. You love the hill.  Right. Well, I think of downhills are kind of like road candy. Here's some miles per gallon  for you. All right, ass. If you go downhill somewhere, you're going to have to go up to  get back to where you were. There's no way around it. If you went downhill, you will have 
[04:34:30]  to go back uphill. So if you're saving gas by going downhill, you're not going to be saving  in the end. Can you go downhill and then find another way home that's also downhill? Yes.  Yes. Okay. It's called perpetual motion. I'm a hyper miler. Oh, you're a hyper miler.  We got one in studio. I've started Ted's Hyper Miling Club. Ted again. We live at the top  of a mountain and we built an elevator inside of it, which carries our cars back up. Everything's 
[04:35:00]  on the hill on the way down. Ted's an ass. We hate Ted. Ted's a hyper miler. You want  to hear more about hyper miling? Of course. This guy must be a real treat. Oh, he's a hoot.  He talks about hyper miling all the time. I'm a hyper miler. Really? I'm going to go get  a drink. Shut up. While you're doing rails off, you know, fake boobies, this guy's talking 
[04:35:30]  about hyper miling at the party and ruining your buzz. Among fellow hyper milers, he is known  as light foot. And like the rest of them, he is obsessed with higher pressure and wind  drag, controlled starts and rolling stops. Do you ever run the air conditioning? Yes.  Only on downhills. His Honda hybrid is supposed to get 66 miles per gallon. He wants to double  it. I've managed 103.6. That's the best I've ever done so far. But now I think that he knows  that it's .6. .6. What a nerd. You know what would really help this hyper miling is he was 
[04:36:00]  going slowly downhill enjoying some rare AC. And a man who barely speaks English, who's  had way too much to drink, yet happens to have access to a garbage truck, plows through a red  light. Like there's not even a skid mark. And then he gets 103 miles to the gallon on the  grill of that guy's truck. He never has to pay for gas again because his limbs are all 
[04:36:30]  over. And he would have lived had he just been stepping on the gas. That's right. He's a  hyper miler. I hate this guy's guts. Among fellow hyper milers, he is known as light foot.  And like the rest of them, he is obsessed with higher pressure and wind drag, controlled  starts, and rolling stops. Do you ever run the air conditioning? Yes, only on downhills.  His Honda hybrid is supposed to get 66 miles per gallon. He wants to double it. I've managed 
[04:37:00]  103.6. That's the best I've ever done so far. But now I think I can do better. The first  step, get a mile per gallon gauge. It plugs into any model built after 96 and lets you monitor  your efficiency starting with how long you idle. If you think you're going to be stopped  for more than about 10 seconds, it's best to shut off the engine. You'll save gas right  there. It doesn't use more gas to start up. Modern fuel injected cars don't use much gas 
[04:37:30]  to get them started. I'd rather get 12 miles to the gallon. He shuts it off if he's going  to be stopped for 10 seconds. This is too much thinking also. And too much stress.  Too much stress. Too much thinking. Am I going to be stopped for more than 10 seconds? I got  to shut my car off. Oh my God, it's more than 10 seconds. Uh oh. I'd love for this idiot  to shut his car off at a light and then go to start it and just have it go. People beeping 
[04:38:00]  at him. You know how much gas that's using? Oh yeah. Trying to restart your car. I'd like  him to have to have that happen in the same intersection where Reginald Denny had a toilet  on his head. Here's the last track on the hypermiler. Listen to what else he does.  Among the other techniques to help you save in stop and go traffic, leave a big space in  front of you and keep rolling. Try to park nose out so you don't have to back up to exit the 
[04:38:30]  space. Why? And slow down. Staying to the right and sticking to the speed limit can help  you beat speeders by more than a dollar a gallon. I'll do 45 to 50 and people can just deal with  it. How often do you get honked at? He drives what? 45 to 50 and people can just deal with  it. Wait, wait, wait. I also got a problem with his park nose out. That's so you don't  have to back out of your parking space. How do you get into it? You're backing into the 
[04:39:00]  parking space, dummy. Oh, is this guy annoying me? Either way, you got to back. You're going  into reverse. Right. Oh, I hate this guy. And then he's driving 45 miles an hour on a highway  and people just have to deal with it so he can save a penny? Yeah. Gallon. I'll do 45 to 50 and  people can just deal with it. How often do you get honked at? Occasionally, but I get  about an equal number of thumbs ups and waves. Really? No, you don't. Do you think people 
[04:39:30]  know what you're doing? That's not a wave when it's that finger. Yeah, he gets the wave  all right. He thinks it's a fancy wave. Give him the wave. Oh, look, I know gas is out of  control, but you know. Just siphon it from someone else's tank. And then you can go as fast as  you want. Yeah. Who's giving a thumbs up to him for driving slow? Exactly. No one.  AF? No one. Exactly. I would actually put liquid plutonium in my gas tank before I would 
[04:40:00]  do anything this man suggests. Doc Brown. Huh? Like Doc Brown. Back to the future.  Oh, no. Another back to the future reference. Liquid plutonium. Hey, let's go to Charleston.  Bill? Hey, guys. Hey. Hey, if he talked to Kenny and told that, I think Kenny would  tell him, there's only so many starts in the starter. What if you used them all up?  Yeah. Because Kenny refuses to use his windshield wipers. Or his horn. He's the worst. This guy 
[04:40:30]  ought to get together with Kenny. Yeah. And Kenny can tell him how to get 40 years out of  one horn. And this guy can tell him how to get X amount of miles. And they can just be  an OCD couple of friends. 40 years. Yes. Yes. Never honk. Yeah. Kenny. Don't honk.  He's the worst. Kenny is an old lady behind the wheel. Let me tell you something about  Kenny. Get glasses at night. He's the worst night driver ever. Is that the exit? No, it's  a birch tree. The exit's a quarter of a mile up. He's that bad? He's an old lady. That's 
[04:41:00]  scary. And he won't get, he has the awful glasses during the day. He won't go for the exam  at night. Oh. To get night glasses, Kenny. What are you doing? Unbelievable. So there  you go. Hyper miling. Yeah. Well, good for him. We all learned something today. Did  we? Yeah. I would love to be a passenger in his car and just go vroom, vroom a lot. Just  vroom, vroom. I'd reach with my foot. I would go over and just jam on the gas real hard and  then step on the brake. Or just do things that really upset him. If he picks you up just getting  in his car with a mop handle and just, you know, push down the gas pedal. Yeah. Stop 
[04:41:30]  it. Oh, he'll go nuts. Roll the window down and put your hand out with your palm facing  forward. Yeah. The wind resistance. You'll be great that you just sugar or sand his gas  tank so every dollar he saved for the last six years now has to be spent to get a new  motor. There you go. Wipe right out. Clean slate, bucko. Guys trying to help out the environment  and save some money and we just goof on him. No, he's not. He's OCD about it. Yeah. And 
[04:42:00]  he's being an obsessive chiseler. Yeah. And he wants to save every dollar and I hate him  for it. Chiseler. Hello, this is Ernie. Lots of an IP relay call. I would like to open  your ass with my fingertips. Open your ass with your fingertips. As far as I can. And glaze  down your ass crack with my pointy tongue deep inside. And glaze down your ass crack  with my pointy tongue deep inside the. The crevice of your hole and then slap your large cock off 
[04:42:30]  my cheek. And slap your large cock on my cheek. Yes. And then choke me like the nasty or cock  lover that I am. And then choke me like the nasty. Cock lover that I am. I want to smell  your shit on my cock. I have to go. I hope you came on your hairy stomach in your belly  button. Thank you. Opie and Anthony. Hey, it's Jim Norton. We're done here. The Opie and Anthony 
[04:43:00]  show. Ron and Fez are up next on the virus XM 202. Sirius 107. No. 97. 197. That's 107 plus 90.  I should be fucking. So I should put your dick in talent and hit my mouth with it. </pre>
