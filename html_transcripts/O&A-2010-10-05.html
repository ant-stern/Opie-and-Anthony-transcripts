<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts engaging in self-deprecating humor, acknowledging their perceived lack of talent and relying on exploiting others for content.  A listener calls in to suggest violent acts against New York weather girl Shea Ryan, prompting the hosts to critique her appearance and discuss their preferences in women, contrasting “high-maintenance” women with those they find more appealing.  This is followed by a graphic discussion of videos depicting lion attacks on their trainers, with the hosts providing detailed descriptions and gleeful reactions.  They speculate on the trainers' actions and the lions' motivations.

A substantial portion of the show is dedicated to *Hoarders* and *Intervention*.  The hosts express disgust towards the subjects' behaviors, suggesting extreme solutions for hoarding, and harshly criticize the families and professionals involved in the interventions. A caller shares a personal anecdote about his father's hoarding and his own conflicted relationship, including frequent arguments where he apologized to avoid escalation, even when feeling unfairly blamed. This segues into a discussion about religion, sparked by a caller's experience with addiction and recovery. The conversation explores spirituality versus organized religion, with the hosts and the caller sharing personal beliefs and experiences, including struggles with prayer.  The hosts ironically comment on a van crash that killed people attending a religious revival.  They also discuss baptism and the challenges of raising religious children.

The impending arrival of guest Jim Brewer, author of "I'm Not High," is announced, with the hosts teasing the upcoming interview.  A separate segment focuses on Sam's exceptionally long hair, prompting jokes and absurd suggestions for its removal, including using Bob Kelly's semen as conditioner.  The hosts then delve into a scathing review of the "Hot 96" morning show in Evansville, Indiana, hosted by Adam Smasher and Shonda.  Their critique includes highly offensive commentary on Adam Smasher's name (initially mistaken for "Atom Smasher"), Shonda's appearance, and their on-air dynamic.  The discussion extends to the attractiveness of Kris Jenner and her daughters, using vulgar and offensive language, and then shifts to crude and sexually explicit comments about older women.  Audio clips from the Evansville show are played, including a poorly executed 911 call bit and a story about Shonda showering with her son, which further fuels crude and offensive jokes. The segment concludes with a discussion of Adam Smasher's auto-tuned song about Fall Festival food and more commentary on the Evansville show.

A quick rundown of fall festival foods elicits disgust and anger from the hosts, leading back to a discussion of Adam and Shonda's radio show and their suggested alternative careers.  The hosts mention their upcoming "Jocktober" visits to other radio shows, targeting Scott and Todd.  Jim Brewer then joins the studio. The conversation turns to Brewer's childhood weight, bullying, and weight loss.  He shares humorous and tragic anecdotes about caring for his aging and ailing parents, including his father's incontinence and inappropriate public comments, even sexually suggestive ones to waiters.  He recounts a wild night out with Lars Ulrich of Metallica, involving a stolen knapsack and aggressive interactions. Brewer promotes his book and upcoming book signings, discussing the challenges and rewards involved. The segment ends with a discussion of Metallica's "Black Album" and a brief description of a Metallica-themed video clip.

The conversation with Jim Brewer continues, focusing heavily on his SNL experiences.  He details an intense confrontation with Joe Pesci in the green room over a sketch involving ethnic slurs, with Robert De Niro's last-minute intervention saving the sketch. He shares stories from backstage at a Music Cares event involving Tom Waits and Ozzy Osbourne, anecdotes about Chris Farley's struggles with addiction (including a phone call where Farley questioned his sanity), interactions with other SNL cast members like Tracy Morgan (including repeatedly "raping" Will Ferrell's character), and his personal spirituality, including communication with his deceased brother.  He also touches upon Lorne Michaels's power and influence, including a near-miss attempt to get the Beatles on SNL.  The overall tone is conversational, and the show frequently includes vulgar language and potentially offensive material, reflecting the free-flowing nature of the Opie and Anthony Show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Come on, come on, put the whole thing in your mouth.  Freedom of fucking speech, like we've said many times, the freedom to say some awful things.  You might not like it, but we have the right to say them.  Oh my. 
[00:00:30]  We have low self-esteem as a show.  They are not doing anything, they're not highly skilled, they have no talent.  We're just exploiting people.  See kids, smoke your pot, play your video games, and watch TV.  You'll be better off when you get our age.  There's no ratings here, no one cares.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:01:00]  Ah.  This might be a little too local, but J.D. in New York City.  Just took a peek at the instant feedback here.  He writes, oh, don't you just want to bend Shea Ryan over a chair and make her ass bleed?  Well, very good morning to you too, my friend.  You know who Shea Ryan is, right?  The, uh...  We're not sure if we like her or not. 
[00:01:30]  She's like the weather girl on one of the local channels here in New York.  Yeah.  But she, her hairdo is a little, a little too old.  They call her Shea Ray.  Shea Ray.  That's what they call her on the show.  We'll go to Shea Ray for the weather.  Yo, Shea Ray.  Yeah.  She's got really nice boobs, but she kind of keeps them anchored down.  Although in that shot, she's, she's letting them loose a little bit.  Any, uh, sexy pictures of her?  No.  Oh, yeah.  She's, she's trying to be a professional weather girl. 
[00:02:00]  Ah.  Unlike a lot of these other ones, they are just using that to shake their A's.  Right.  A lot of the weather girls just want to shake their A's.  Good luck to her.  But she's got like, I don't know, her hair is all fucked up.  Yeah, it looks old school.  It looks like, makes her look too old or something, right?  Yeah.  Like when you watch Miss America.  And this 19 year old, and she looks like she's 30.  30.  Pushing 30, whatever.  Pushing the wacky hairdo.  You're absolutely right.  Hair dos.  They're too polished. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Do you like the polished girl look?  No.  When they're just over the top polished?  No.  Where you know you can't mess up anything?  Like, regular.  You gotta be really careful if you're with them.  Regular chicks, yeah.  You don't like the high maintenance, bleach blonde type fucking shitload of makeup.  Right.  That's just, like some guys are like, oh yeah, she's hot.  Like, playboy chicks and stuff.  Mm-hmm.  No.  No.  Doesn't do it.  You want one that you can roll around in the mud with a little bit. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Have a little fun with.  But you want them to clean up nice.  Sure.  You just don't want them to be polished all day long.  No, you gotta be able to take them places.  Yeah, exactly.  Not have them look like slabs.  Exactly.  But, you know.  I want to applaud the lion that attacked the fucking trainer.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah, way over there.  Lion tamer mauled.  Oh, yeah.  It's a great video.  It's all over the place today.  We're watching it right now.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  There's squirting water on the lions. 
[00:03:30]  The lion's like, thank you for keeping us cool while we rip this idiot to pieces.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't believe they would attack a guy who wants them to jump on a ball in front of a bunch  of screaming people.  And if he doesn't, he whips them.  I fucking love it.  Well, how this one started, he used a little, like, metal prod.  I don't think it had any electricity, but just a little prod to keep him in line.  They love that, I hear.  And the lion said, you know what?  I've had it with your stupid metal prod.  You're done.  They didn't kill the guy, but it looked like they came close to ripping his left arm right 
[00:04:00]  off his body.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was really close.  How about I just rip you to shreds?  I'm a huge fan when these animals attack like this.  Huge fan.  Gotta love it.  What is this one?  That's the MGM one.  There's been two lion attacks in the last couple of weeks.  Oh, man.  This one I saw last night as well.  And this lion finally had it.  But these trainers know what the fuck they're doing.  Because the one stayed calm and was able to keep the situation under control. 
[00:04:30]  Because I've seen this in MGM.  Right.  This is that place where, obviously, there are the lions.  Right.  And you could look through the glass.  Right in the lobby.  And, wow.  Look at this guy.  He's just pushing his head down like you would do a cat or a dog.  Yeah, he's trying to alpha male the motherfucker.  Right.  And look at this one.  He's like, no, man.  He's grabbing his mane.  He's just grabbing his mane and pushing him aside.  But he wants that one guy.  Right.  And then that guy got out of there.  Actually, that one wasn't that bad.  Oh, man.  He still wants him.  Oh, wait.  Unless I haven't seen the full video. 
[00:05:00]  No, he got out of there.  That motherfucking trainer got out of there quick.  God, the lion looks like Tina Turner, doesn't it?  Yeah.  From Thunderdome.  What a fucking beautiful animal, though.  Yeah.  Would you want one of those in your backyard, Ed?  You fucking man.  Oh, I would like that a tiger.  Not tigers.  Lions over tigers.  Yeah.  And the lion has helped the trainers.  That was like when a slave would rat on another slave who was thinking of escaping.  They have that fucking lioness so trained, she ran over and kind of bit the hindquarters. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, bit the other lion.  Either that or you're going to get yourself shot.  Cut it out.  Yeah, exactly.  Watch.  She's like, hey, hey, hey.  Just help it out.  She's like, don't fuck up this easy gig.  No one shoots at us here.  They beat us.  It's great.  Because if they think you're a problem, they're going to think I'm a problem.  And next thing you know, we're both fucking dead.  That is.  Yeah, that one's not that big of a deal.  The new one is awesome.  That guy was doing some of that fucking lion whisperer shit, though.  Yeah.  He like jumped on his head and pushed him down. 
[00:06:00]  Like, no, I'm the boss motherfucker.  That's right.  I'd have just been going like, ah, ah, getting all ripped apart.  Oh, yeah.  Lion attacks trainers and former Soviet Union.  Former Soviet Union.  We know how to train the lion.  And the town that this happened in has lion in its name or something like that.  How ironic.  I was half watching this.  Ironic.  Because as soon as I knew that the fucking guy didn't rip his arm off, I was out. 
[00:06:30]  That looks like the one we were just watching.  Oh, grabbed his arm.  Nothing better than a circus where the children are screaming.  That was it, right?  Now that water seems to work a little bit, doesn't it?  Whoa, he's going back for seconds.  Oh, these lines have had it.  Ah, I hope they fucking kill him.  Look at this.  It's a shitty circus, too.  Yeah, that really looks...  Well, it's Russian. 
[00:07:00]  It looks like minor league wrestling or something like that.  Yeah.  Probably have a bear come out stapled to a fucking bike.  Ooh, big lumbering dumb bear riding a bicycle.  Let me say hi to CJ in Atlanta.  CJ.  This isn't CJ.  This is Larry King.  Hey, Larry.  What do you got for the program?  Good evening, Anthony and Opium and little Jimmy.  I wanted to ask, when training lions, how important is it not to get mauled? 
[00:07:30]  We're going to miss Larry King.  Yeah, we certainly will.  We are going to miss Larry King.  We're going to miss the caller's imitating Larry King.  We'll miss this man.  Yeah.  It might be a little too early to do our Larry King bit.  What else is going on, man?  You guys all right?  Gang, gang, gang.  I have that throat sore.  Oh, that shit's been going around.  No, it doesn't hurt, but it's like that little tickle when I laugh.  Yeah.  It's like a little.  Clipping her on this show.  You won't be laughing.  Yeah.  Oh, gosh. 
[00:08:00]  Just in case you didn't stay up, Patriots defeated the Dolphins Monday night football.  I think it was Travis was saying 7-6 at halftime, and final score was 41-14.  Wow.  A little dismantling of the Dolphins last night.  Second half blowout.  Second half blowout happened.  A blowout.  Yeah.  More rain in New York?  Yeah, it's just like 7-6.  Starting to go away?  It's terrible.  Just nasty.  I didn't do much.  Just watched my usual Hoarders. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, fuck.  Hoarders and Intervention.  Right.  I can't get enough of that Hoarders show.  I can't do it.  It's just...  What was last night's problem?  Oh, it was something completely different.  Some self-centered asshole blowing off the family and friends so they could live in filth.  Right.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Nothing like they ever have on.  And completely just indignant about the whole thing and complaining and going through a little box.  The house is just completely covered in shit and there's a little box, like a shoe box, and she spends an hour going through each little piece in a shoe box. 
[00:09:00]  Enough already.  You're like, what are you doing?  I love...  I would love the show where you just diesel fuel the house.  You could fit 10 Hoarders in one show.  Right.  You tell them you have, like, five minutes to get whatever you want, put it in this suitcase, and then we're burning your house to the ground.  Or you just tell them, go on the porch, we'll be careful, and then you kick them in the ass and make them sit in the yard while their shit is burned. 
[00:09:30]  Give them a good kick in the ass.  While they watch it just getting burned.  Yeah.  I mean, what would happen after they cry for 12 straight hours?  Then what?  They're going to continue crying?  They're crazy anyway.  Or they're going to have a cleaner house.  You got a nice...  Now you've got property to sell.  Some prank show should do that, though.  Make believe they're coming in to do the right thing with the psychologists, the psychiatrists, the moving companies, the frat kids.  And then you pile up their shit in the backyard and have a big bonfire.  Burn a big bonfire. 
[00:10:00]  Right in front of them.  That's the whole thing, too.  It gets...  It's even worse now watching it when the shrink shows up.  Well, hello, everybody.  How are we doing today, everyone?  Now remember, everybody, Diana needs our cooperation.  She has final say in what goes out.  Don't do anything unless she says it's okay.  Coddle, coddle, coddle.  Yeah.  Final say means in the end she's going to throw maybe a gum wrapper away. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, maybe.  If that.  But that has to have some kind of significance, right?  Morons.  But what makes the show different every time you watch?  I don't know.  You can't watch the same premise over and over again.  Each family and person is a little quirky.  Quirky, to say the least.  But they have their own little quirks.  And I like how the families react because some of the families are just like, go fuck yourselves.  Other ones really want to help.  They're all crying.  And last night had this guy named Prince Patrick or something. 
[00:11:00]  Prince Poppycock?  No, Prince Patrick his name was.  And he was dressed in like this, a collector of Asian stuff.  And he was dressed in some kind of Asian attire.  And he had this doll in his car.  And just, he was a disastrous mess.  Right.  And after that, it was an intervention with some guy that was a karate guy.  Oh, man.  You did a double feature last night.  Yeah.  Who turned out to be a crackhead.  And he was with this woman who still loved him and everything. 
[00:11:30]  A fiance.  And she had like kids.  And God, the daughter was really hot.  And what issues she had.  Holy mother of fuck.  Because she was like, I love him so much as a father.  And he just went back on drugs.  And I'm just like, oh, this.  Who the fuck?  Oh, my.  She's perfect for you.  Oh, perfect.  I mean, perfect.  Great issues.  Great issues.  Yeah.  So it was a sit on the couch and watch crap television. 
[00:12:00]  Watch Me, Me, Me, Me TV.  Me, Me TV.  That's it.  Me, Me, Me TV.  Me, Me, Me TV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Oh, this guy saw Hoarders last night.  We got Steve in Tampa.  Steve.  Hey, boys.  Hey, brother.  I can't believe this horse.  I went past the channel.  And I went back to it.  And I started watching it.  These people are the Hoarders.  I mean, I got these people living on the corner from me.  You can tell they're Hoarders because their cars, their windshields, their dashboards 
[00:12:30]  are just filled with junk.  So I couldn't watch this thing.  I was watching and watching.  And these people said, oh, I'm not a Hoarder.  And they got shit all over their houses.  Anthony, I don't know.  How do people live like that?  I don't fucking know.  I couldn't.  Even when I had my Pee Wee's Playhouse apartment, it was just beer cans and toys.  My family dynamic growing up was really strange because I think my dad had Hoarder tendencies. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  He collected a lot of shit.  And we had a huge garage that was separate from the house that was just filled with a  lot of junk.  I mean, you could have thrown everything away.  And I remember, I didn't know what hoarding was until probably, like everyone else, only  a mere few years ago, right?  Yeah, like that.  It's an actual thing.  Maybe five, six, seven years ago.  And we tried to get him to clean that garage over the years.  And he just wouldn't do it. 
[00:13:30]  And then in the house, he had these weird collections.  But on the other side was my mom that threw out everything, including family memories.  So they kind of balanced each other out, I think.  Matter, anti-matter.  Oh, absolutely.  My mom would throw away everything.  And my dad tried to collect everything.  She'd throw away things that were for the family?  Everything, yeah.  I mean everything, just to keep the house tidy.  So she was on the other side of the spectrum.  But I think my dad probably would have been a hoarder if he was let loose. 
[00:14:00]  Did they argue or no?  No, not really.  Really, no.  We all just allowed my mom just to fucking run the entire house.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It was a lot easier that way.  No, my dad sat on the couch and watched a lot of fucking basketball.  Not listening to?  No, no.  All hell would be breaking loose.  Oh, geez.  He just thought it would be best to just kind of sit there and watch TV.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh.  And the times he got involved in, he would have to deal with what she had to say to him as well.  Yeah, that's kind of one of those situations where we've all been in there, but without kids or anything. 
[00:14:30]  You know, you go in, you just kind of don't want to deal with the problem, and the second you bring one thing up, you're completely immersed in said problem.  Oh, yeah.  No, my mom was always right.  Really?  She never officially admitted to one stinking wrong.  Nothing wrong, never.  My entire life.  Perfect.  Not one.  All those years.  She never did one thing wrong in her.  She's the only person alive. 
[00:15:00]  That's great then, right?  She's fucking perfect.  Wow.  She would never go like, oh, all right, I screwed up.  Not really, no.  No.  Not really.  There were a lot of times that you had to go find her and apologize to her, even though she started this shit.  Just to quell the problem?  Oh, yeah.  Just so dinner got made?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, does that sound like my first marriage?  Oh, really?  My only marriage, actually.  She was never wrong?  Yeah, yeah, never wrong, and I was usually doing the apologizing just to stop the fucking problem. 
[00:15:30]  Because if I kept going, it was just going to escalate into said World War III.  Doesn't that suck that, logically, that is the easiest path?  Yeah, it does suck, but it is.  But you know.  The path of least resistance.  You know, all right, I'll apologize, even though I had nothing to do with this shit.  Nothing to do with this.  But at least it would calm down the situation.  It would start off with like a, look, look, I'm sorry about that whole situation thing. 
[00:16:00]  And I'm seething.  Yeah.  Seething inside.  Does she throw in a little, well, you should be?  Yeah, it's like, well, you know.  Which makes it even harder to do the part you don't feel like doing.  Well, you should be.  Yeah, it wouldn't so much be, well, you should be.  Right.  It would be like, you know, yeah, I'm sorry about that.  It's like, well, I tried to tell you, you know, we didn't even need to have this argument  because I was telling you right from the beginning.  And all I'm thinking is, yeah, you were telling me. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  The thing I'm still, I still want to fucking argue about.  She's giving you a couple.  I'm being magnanimous here, so shut the fuck up.  She gives you a couple more shots as you're trying to just calm the situation down.  That's right.  I dropped like eight C-bombs when she walked away, you know, under my breath.  I loved it when she walked away.  Did that make you feel better to do it when she was walking away, though?  See, I would have to do it right to their face.  No, if you did it to her face, it was a problem.  Yeah, I understand that.  Then the cigarette machine was going to get dented. 
[00:17:00]  Jesus.  That's a tough broad.  You know what happens.  I would have said something like, yeah, well, why don't we just take that right there?  I did.  A lot of times.  That's your chip.  See, I don't apologize for nothing.  It was just so infuriating to have to do that and then have to take the shit that happened  after just to stop the arguing.  Or it wasn't going to stop, especially late at night. 
[00:17:30]  It would start getting very late, and I'm laying in bed.  I want to sleep and just...  And I'm just thinking, unless I just give up, I'm not going to go to sleep.  Yeah, I don't understand some of you women out there where you decide that you need to  bring up some pretty heavy shit right as your head is hitting the pillow.  And you think to yourself, really, right now?  We're going to do this right now, which means at least another two to three hours before 
[00:18:00]  this could calm down?  And it would usually start, like, in the house downstairs or something like that, and it  would just start getting kicked up.  And I would think it would be best for me to just go the fuck to bed.  And so I'd go to bed, and then, like, fucking Joan Crawford, she'd be standing in the doorway  going, well, we're just going to let this sit overnight?  Is she backlit at this point?  Yes, totally backlit with kabuki makeup on. 
[00:18:30]  And I would just sit there like, oh, no, it's come to me.  The argument has come to me now, and I'm not sleeping.  Why can't you just go, yeah, we're going to just let this sit?  I'm tired.  We'll pick up in the morning.  Oh, B, oh, B, oh, B.  Oh, no, it doesn't work like that.  I know, I know.  How about something like this?  You know, I think your drinking is getting out of hand, and we should talk about this  when you sober up.  In the mirror, I should do this?  Would that have worked? 
[00:19:00]  No.  No?  No, because it would turn out to be, and it had nothing to do with the drinking.  It was whatever point was being made, which would promptly be forgotten in the morning.  But it had nothing to do with the drinking.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Out.  Out at bars with my dumb fucking thinking it was going to work preface.  All right, we're going out.  Let's just keep this in mind. 
[00:19:30]  We're okay right now.  Look, me and you, we're fine, right?  There's no problems?  No, no problems.  Like, surprise.  Like, where's this coming from?  Yeah.  Why would you say this?  There's no problems, and I'd be like, no, no, no, I know, I know, I know.  Well, no problems.  Let's just remember, during the course of the night, that we're going out to have fun,  and there's not a problem.  So, we shouldn't get into any problems, is all I'm saying. 
[00:20:00]  All right?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  A little look like, that's weird.  Why would you say this?  Okay, everybody, in your head, imagine your best oldie-time movie of the minute hand spinning  and the hour hand spinning in fast motion a couple of hours later.  It has to be in black and white.  Yeah, yeah, in black and white.  Okay.  Don't get to the calendar pages peeling off yet.  Okay, a few hours goes by.  You got it?  What the fuck is your problem? 
[00:20:30]  I see.  Give me that fucking look.  What's the fucking look?  No, you think that shot's a good idea right now?  Okay, fine, fine.  No, it is good.  Fine.  I'm fucking fine.  You're the fucking asshole.  Yeah, I am.  I'm the asshole.  And then slowly turn and look at my embarrassed friends turn their head away really quickly. 
[00:21:00]  They're all too scared to tell you they'll just dump the bitch.  Would they ever be embarrassed for you?  Oh, always embarrassed for me.  I could tell by the quick way they turn their head away.  They just zip their head away real quick, but not quick enough for me not to see that  they were looking and probably talking amongst themselves about, you know, oh my God, look  at the hell he's dealing with.  Cut and Zilla's at it again.  I got to raise my hand.  I was one of those guys.  Of course.  I'm like, I don't know how to tell this guy.  Oh, here it is.  And then I'm thinking, well, I got my own fucking issue, so who am I to say? 
[00:21:30]  I think that's fucking shit.  Wouldn't you want to yell at her for talking like that in front of your friends?  Oh.  Like we're in public.  I couldn't do anything.  It was easier not to.  I saw it go down.  Now, there's a couple of things there, Anthony.  Yeah.  Now, you like to party a lot, obviously, but you...  I like it.  It's fun.  Your personality doesn't change that much when you get really fucking rip-roaring drunk.  No.  Her personality certainly did, but you were smart enough, even though you were partying 
[00:22:00]  hard, to realize that, like you said, you think that shot's a good idea.  In your head, you knew that she couldn't handle her alcohol like you could handle your alcohol  in those situations.  Shot, not a good idea.  But you would never think shot, not a good idea, right?  No, I would.  A lot of times, I would set up something with a bartender to just give me water in a shot  glass.  Oh, when people were still coming out?  Yeah, yeah.  I go, if someone wants to buy me a shot, I go, and believe me, it wasn't because I'm, 
[00:22:30]  you know, a teetotaler.  It was because I was already hammered.  I didn't want to keep drinking shots.  I wanted to keep drinking beers all night, but if I did shots, I knew I would be so fucked up,  I wouldn't enjoy myself, am I not out of it?  I'd get sick or whatever.  So I decided, you know, I would just drink some water, because if you say you're not  doing shots, the guy that wants to get you the shot is just annoyed you're not doing  a shot.  Give me the shot!  I always felt guilty about that, because you knew the bartender was still paying the  guy.  I mean, charging the guy for the shots, even though one was water. 
[00:23:00]  Then he'd pocket the money.  So who cares?  But realistically, especially back then when we were hanging out more, it was impossible  to do all the shots that were coming your way.  It was physically impossible.  Oh, windows.  But she couldn't handle her booze like you could.  No, no.  And her personality definitely changed drastically.  She actually was very nice when she wasn't drinking.  And she was very nice through the first few drinks, even.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the whole Jekyll and Hyde thing.  I remember hanging out with you guys, and you would just see the moment. 
[00:23:30]  The line, right.  Where it would turn, and then, man, everyone was watching their shit.  I was like, oh, boy.  Everybody.  Oh, boy.  She would yell at her own mother.  Oh, yeah.  And her mother was sauced, too, half the time.  Oh, yeah.  But she would go after her if she had to.  It just happened in a second.  Like, I could turn around to talk to somebody.  And she was fine.  Right.  But then I'd turn and look back, and I'd see the eyes.  The eyes are the first thing that went.  They'd just start wheeling in her head like pinwheels. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, man.  And I'd be like, oh, no.  Oh, she's past the point of no return.  And then I'd just see more shots coming to the bar or something and just go, oh, my life, my night.  Good God.  It's just done.  That's why, in the end, I love that you're living your life differently.  Oh.  Because I know where you've been.  I know exactly where you've been.  I had quite enough, my friend.  It's extremely different now.  Oof.  Yeah.  Thank God. 
[00:24:30]  It's very, very different now.  Let me say hi to Greg in D.C.  Greg!  Good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Anthony, I was wondering, could we go back in time and do the little clock in black and white  because color hadn't actually been invented?  Oh, yes.  Oh.  This is so long ago there was no color.  No, silly.  All those movies were in black and white.  They don't do the clock in color anymore.  Yeah, because that would be considered hack.  I don't think so.  Yeah, I haven't seen the old clock thing. 
[00:25:00]  That's only a digital clock now.  Oh, right.  Sure.  Yeah, see?  That's what I meant.  The kids today don't even know what clocks are.  Of course.  What?  Oh, my God.  That's so funny.  I linger a day.  What show was that?  That was yesterday.  Detroit.  I know.  Oh, Blaine and Fatty.  Blaine and Allison.  Allison.  We're getting ready for Jacktober.  We're going early with Jacktober today because we got Jim Brewer coming in. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Brewer wrote a book.  He's promoting it today.  I read the whole book, actually, already, and it's really good.  Where is it?  We had copies.  And he's coming in at 8 o'clock to promote that song.  What's the gist of the book?  It's Brewer being Brewer.  Brewer being Brewer.  Some SNL stories.  Some growing up in Florida, getting ready for going into the stand-up.  Ronnie B's mentioned.  And Ronnie B's Comedy Club.  And kind of like moments.  Yeah.  Brewer's very spiritual.  I did not know that.  Really?  But he's not.  He's religious, but he's not organized religion religious, I guess is the best way to put it. 
[00:26:00]  Kind of like a...  I didn't think the guy believed in God.  So we got to talk about that with him.  But he's had shit happen in his life where he's completely convinced that some kind of spiritual God thing helped him out.  Is he getting preachy?  No.  He's been like this his whole life.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know it either.  Look at that.  And he would get in arguments with people that were actually a particular religion.  And he's like, fuck that.  I could just talk to God. 
[00:26:30]  Look, I'm talking to him now.  I don't need to be in a fucking...  Oh, so the organized religion thing annoys him?  Yeah, yeah.  As well as it does me.  That's where I'm at.  We have to get my kid baptized.  And I'm like, how about we do it when he can walk?  And he can walk up there and do it himself.  You got to go through those motions just in case.  No, I know.  You know?  My sister never went through those motions.  And I always thought, you got to do it just in case.  Because just because you don't believe in religion, just in case there is, you can't fuck your own kids out of it. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, look what you did.  Like I have...  Now he's in limbo.  I got a nephew and niece, they're in limbo.  They have no concept of religion whatsoever.  Yeah.  Because they decided that...  They actually said, we'll let them decide.  But you can't let your kids decide.  Now, by then it's too late.  You got to push them into something and then let them go find their spiritual way.  The religion thing has always been the parents have to just shove the kid into religion.  And let them suffer like we did.  Right.  Let them suffer and then let them later make a decision. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  As a matter of fact, the intervention that I watched last night, the mother and father of this addict broke up over religion.  The mother is so religious and she just keeps talking about how she prays for her son and this, that.  And all I'm thinking is, wow, look at what your religion did.  It did nothing for your son who's a crackhead, who was shaking.  They had him on camera smoking crack in the basement of his mom's house. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  And then it goes, he would get paranoid episodes and you'd see him go, did you hear that?  And the camera's on him.  And then he'd go, he'd stand up and look around.  He'd shut the light off and he'd go, shh, just be quiet for a second.  And then he spun around to look behind him.  It was great.  He was freaking out.  Was that hoarders or intervention?  Because it sounds like the same show.  I know.  So it was his drugs?  The crack had him shaking like crazy.  It was great.  Right.  But it's like the mother was so ultra-religious and the sister was religious and the son's like crying at one point. 
[00:28:30]  And she goes, it's okay.  Strong men cried.  Jesus, Jesus cried.  Jesus cried.  And like the guy wants to hear this shit.  He's a crackhead.  Stop it.  He just had nails in his hand.  He had a good reason to cry.  He had a good reason to cry.  Shit hurts.  Shed a few tears.  Passion of the Christ.  All right, we get it.  Jesus suffered.  Holy.  Should have took MMA.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  But the old school movies of Jesus, it didn't look too bad, the beating. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, the crown of thorns were the hardest thing.  Yeah, Passion of Christ.  Like, ow.  They showed you what it really was all about.  Ow.  That hurts.  A couple things about religion.  I think another van fucking crashed and killed everybody.  Really?  Yeah, that story's a couple days old.  What religion was that?  Because don't we have a new thing going on?  Yeah.  If a van crashes, then we've got to count that religion out.  If it's holy rollers and they die in some fiery crash on the way to doing something good  for that particular religion, that means that religion doesn't freaking exist. 
[00:29:30]  It means the religion is horseshit.  And we had another one.  If someone could help me out, because it's a couple days old.  I didn't think we were going down this path today.  Yeah, you've got a religious van that is driving down the Taconic and a big rock fucking dislodges  after 10 million years and slams into it and kills everybody?  Yeah.  Your religion's horseshit.  Yeah, we're going to take care of this for everybody.  God's angry with you.  We're shock jocks, but we're going to tell you which religion is the one.  Oh, we'll figure it out.  Is the one in the end.  Because I was walking around my neighborhood yesterday and I saw many religions represented. 
[00:30:00]  That's what happens when you walk around Manhattan.  Did you see the Jews?  I saw the Jews.  Did you see the Holy Roller Catholics?  I saw what looked like either Catholics or Protestants.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw the blacks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I saw some Muslims.  Some Muslims.  And I was thinking to myself, because we've done this break on the radio, like which one  of these religions is the one?  I say Catholicism.  You think?  Well, that's what I'm in. 
[00:30:30]  You know, and not even big time.  Yeah.  Just enough to get me by, I think.  Just enough for one of those.  Do you pray to God?  Well, when I'm in trouble.  Yeah, I know.  We all do.  I need something, you know.  I'm the old, in case of emergency, break Bible thing.  In the end, I think we all believe in something.  I love the guys.  We've had a few come on the show and they're all tough guys.  Like, they don't believe in anything.  But some hardcore shit goes down.  What are you doing?  God.  I'm just going to ask you this one thing. 
[00:31:00]  Exactly.  Um, could you please just get me out of this jam?  Right.  And Brewer's a minister.  That's right.  What?  We'll have to ask him about that.  He can marry people.  He's that guy.  What is up with Brewer?  He's always been like this.  Really?  It's just not the organized part.  I've only known wacky Brewer.  I've never gotten in depth with the spiritual Brewer.  Brewer's deep.  I know.  He's a deep guy.  Damn.  So, we'll have him on in about an hour. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, cool.  Four.  Oh, okay.  Is this the story?  Ah, the Georgia one, right?  Uh, Bobby.  Yeah.  There was like four people killed in Blakely, Georgia or some shit like that.  It's right down the street from my house and...  Oh, well.  It happens.  Yeah, here it is.  Pastor, three others killed in Georgia church van crash.  Yeah, there comes Sunday, you're going to see a shitload of long white vans with 20 windows full of people everywhere.  An aging church van headed to an out-of-state revival blew a tire on a highway. 
[00:32:00]  So, they were going to do something good for their religion.  Oh, boy.  Blew a tire on a highway and flipped repeatedly, ejecting all 19 people on board and killing the pastor, his daughter, and two others.  19 people?  Well, yeah, 19 people.  That's a lot of people for a van.  But they were going to do something good.  Of course they were.  That doesn't make sense. 
[00:32:30]  What religion were they?  Does it say?  Yeah, what religion can we check off the list that doesn't exist now?  Well, it says, um, where is it now?  It has to be Baptist.  Killing the pastor and, uh...  Is it a pastor?  Is it a reverend, um...  Yeah, I think I'm going Baptist.  I'm going Baptist.  Uh, Blakely, Georgia?  I might say Baptist, too.  I'm in trouble.  Mike, go ahead.  Oh, B.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, I love you guys.  I love the show.  Yeah, what's up, Mike? 
[00:33:00]  Okay, you saw the Jews, right?  Yeah.  And you saw the Catholics and the Protestants.  Yeah.  Yeah, I basically...  There's a new religion out there.  It's called Black.  The Black is a religion.  Everyone's calling me out on that one.  Black is a religion?  Wrecks of Massachusetts, right?  Ah, yeah.  Well, I don't know.  What are they?  Well, they could be anything.  They could be Baptists?  Normally Baptists in the South.  Every once in a while, you see a few blacks in, um... 
[00:33:30]  Catholicism.  Catholicism, yeah.  And you get a few of the black Jews.  They go Muslim.  They go hardcore like Muhammad Ali.  Muslims, right, right, right.  So, I don't know.  Muslims.  That's a wacky religion.  Graham in Pennsylvania.  Graham.  Opie, I thought you just said that you don't subscribe to organized religion, yet baptism  is an institution of organized religion.  Yeah, I know you're calling me a hypocrite, but I think Anthony described it perfectly.  Yeah, you don't want to.  I'm not doing it for myself. 
[00:34:00]  You hedge your bet.  I'm doing it for him.  I think you got to push...  This is my personal belief that, you know, whatever.  People believe in all sorts of shit, but I think you have to push them towards something  so at least they got a star in a kit and then they can figure shit out.  So, what you're saying is if some child molester doesn't dunk your kid's head in some water,  then he's going to hell.  No, I don't know if I believe that.  I really don't know what I believe as far as all that stuff goes, but I don't think it's  up to me to go, hey, you got to believe what I believe. 
[00:34:30]  No.  I saw it with my nephew and my niece.  They are soulless.  They have no souls because their parents decided that we don't believe in anything, so you're  not going to believe in anything.  And I don't think, in my life, I don't think that's the right way.  You just give them the building blocks and see if they want to continue building with  them.  Yeah, exactly.  That's all.  Their soul is because the church says no.  I think...  Everything they say is right.  Meh.  I think a lot of the things we do in Catholicism is ridiculous. 
[00:35:00]  It's silly.  It's fairy tales.  There's a lot of fairy tales going on.  It's all silly.  So, but I got to, like, push them towards something.  And I don't know the other religions.  That would be kind of cool to just say, hey.  Muscle.  Make him a muscle.  Oh, my God.  My kid.  Give him that little cap that they wear in prison.  My kid's going to have white, blonde hair and has huge blue eyes, so imagine making  him a Muslim.  Make him a Nazi.  We're keeping him close to the vest.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  I know.  They're going to try to recruit him down the road.  All right.  Whatever.  Can I say that?  As we're talking, I'm, like, looking at Perler's book.  Yeah.  Oh, this fucking is a good read.  Why?  Son of a bitch.  Why?  Where are you at?  He's talking about, and I remember this time when him and Chappelle signed on to do Buddies,  which was a home improvement spinoff.  Right.  It did not succeed.  Tim Allen is a jackass.  Tim Allen didn't really support those guys because they were supposed to do some walk-ons  on home improvement, and Tim Allen wasn't feeling it. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, I haven't even gotten that far yet.  Oh, yeah.  You'll get to that part.  I remember it didn't go, but Jim's just a great storyteller.  Right.  Like, he really is a good fucking storyteller.  He's an amazing storyteller.  I'm enjoying the parts that are funny or funny.  The parts that aren't are just an interesting read.  It's like the parts that are informational are interesting.  Right.  It's called a...  What a fat little kid.  Jim Brewer, I'm Not High.  It's a very red cover with a very obviously high Jim Brewer.  You can't miss this book cover.  It's great. 
[00:36:30]  Smart to make it red.  He's cursed with eyes that make him look high all the time.  Oh, my God.  What a little fat kid.  Was that him?  I know.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He grew up fat.  Oh, he must have gotten punched a lot.  You know the other thing I learned about Brewer?  He was supposed to be aborted.  And his mom, like, openly talks about that.  Oh, my God.  Openly.  That's fucked.  Well, tell him over and over again that you were supposed to be aborted.  Jesus.  Whoops.  Yeah.  What happened?  Missed the appointment?  Fucking Damone didn't show up to his car and they wrote Little Prick on his door? 
[00:37:00]  It's a good story in there.  So, you know, I don't want to give away the whole book, but the details of that is pretty good.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  He's got older parents.  That's something.  The parents were basically done with having kids.  They were both in their 40s, I believe, at the time.  Wow.  And, yeah, she wasn't thinking of having a kid, so everyone told her to have an abortion.  And she'll tell the story to this day.  Do you think that affects him?  Yeah, probably.  Especially earlier years, it probably did affect him a lot. 
[00:37:30]  Sure.  Let's go to Sandman in Iowa.  Sandman.  Hey, guys.  This is Sandman.  Sandman, and I was curious as to what Jimmy's take on religion was these days.  And the reason I'm curious is because, like you guys, I kind of grew up with religion but wasn't really feeling it.  I became an adult and became an addict, and after going through all the treatment and all that stuff, I'm not into organized religion now. 
[00:38:00]  But I am spiritual.  Yeah.  I definitely know what you're saying.  Hard to say.  I don't really like most of it.  Not the spiritual side, but I mean the religious side.  But I also think that as much as it's annoying, religion's an easy target, too.  But there's a lot of really, really good religious people and a lot of really good religious organizations.  They do a lot of work that I certainly wouldn't do.  A lot of good.  A lot of – they're easy to shit on, but there's a lot of organizations that are based in religion doing some good stuff, and we should acknowledge that. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, man, they really – they help a lot of people.  But I find the sanctimonious side of it outweighs a lot of the other stuff for me.  But I don't just dislike people because they're religious anymore because to me that's kind of ignorant, too.  You know.  Well, I agree with that.  But, like, on a day-to-day basis, can you delve into what your spirituality is?  It's lacking, honestly, bro. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, I should be praying in the morning at night just, you know, like gratitude and stuff like that.  Not to – to whoever your higher power is, it's not to you.  But I've gotten away from that, which is probably why my internal life's in turmoil.  I think that seems silly to pray, like, even if you're not praying to any god or just to some entity.  I don't know.  It just seems, like, self-important to think that your dumb words are going to make an impact.  When whatever you're feeling should be enough to translate to this greater power that if it's sorrow for something or if it's regret or need or whatever it is, they should just pick up on it. 
[00:39:30]  Or whatever it is, nature, if you want to say that, the trees and earth and fucking air, it should just pick up on your vibe and know kind of what you're hoping for without having to verbalize and put your hands together at the foot of your bed and, you know, verbalize a prayer. 
[00:40:00]  I think it's more, honestly – I mean, you're right, but I think it's more of an act of humility or an act of stopping and pausing.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, like when you pray –  So it's more for you than it is you thinking how I have to get through and, you know, open the lines of communication, the magic secret telephone to this entity.  I mean, I don't know.  For me, it was, like, always – it was a way just to actually – like, it's real easy to go, like, yeah, I'm grateful for what I got. 
[00:40:30]  But it's like when I look at what I have, it's a lot compared to what I – if life was fair, I'd be dead.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, really, there's no reason I should have what I should have.  I've done that, though.  And other people shouldn't.  I've done it without the religious or spiritual part.  I've been literally laying on the floaty mat in my pool with a drink in my hand, just slowly sloshing around the pool.  And then the thing will turn, and I'll see my house, and it's a beautiful day, and I'll just say, like, wow, this is really good. 
[00:41:00]  And I do appreciate that this is where I am right now.  But it's not like a thank you to some magical power thing.  It's like, wow, whatever it was, fate or whatever.  Like, I am very appreciative of where I am.  But that moment, which is a cool moment to have.  Yeah.  It's like I would like to have that moment every day, even though it's me pausing and saying, like, look. 
[00:41:30]  Like, in the morning, for me, it would be like –  I have it every day when you walk in.  I feel the same way, except there's a homosexual undertone to it, which makes it extraordinarily difficult to tie in with the spiritual, as he will smite us.  You know, it's almost like it's hard to have that moment when I'm in the car and I'm screaming about traffic.  It's almost like it's easier to have it.  Praying is, I guess, historically an act of submission or an act of pausing or an act of stopping everything and just saying, look, help me get through today or whatever.  Whatever the prayer is for each person is up to them. 
[00:42:00]  I don't do any particularly – I don't do the Apostles' Creed or any of that stuff.  Just my own thing.  I think it's more – I think the verbal prayer or even the prayer in your head when you're – but you're saying words to yourself, I think that is more for yourself.  Sure.  Than it is you actually thinking you're speaking on a special magical telephone to this God thing.  That I can understand what you're saying.  Like almost a self kind of, you know, keep yourself in check, take a moment and shit like that. 
[00:42:30]  But otherwise, I do think, like, if there is some kind of entity or power or anything, it should just know what you're feeling.  Yeah.  I just – I don't know how it all ties in.  To be honest, I've – my idea of God or my higher power, whatever you want to call it, has changed a lot.  And I don't really think – I don't think that if there's a God – I don't think he gives a shit if my gig is good.  Or if your sports team wins.  Absolutely.  Or even if my friend dies of cancer or if a baby gets hit by a bus because to me there's a randomness to all of it. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  And to me there's – in the end, I think it all makes sense somehow.  Like perhaps this – you know, when you look at the amount of time we're here, it's such a short amount of time that any amount of discomfort or whatever you want to call it on the grand scheme is nothing.  It's like a bad thought.  Right.  So every prayer or everything, I think, is about acceptance and about coming to terms with things so that my time here is easier.  You know, I don't expect anybody to change the world for me. 
[00:43:30]  God's not going to change the world for me.  I like that you said it all makes sense in the end.  I think it does.  Sure.  I like that.  Maybe.  Well, in my life, I'm not even supposed to be here.  My dad had to lose his first, you know, wife.  Oh, right, right.  High school sweetheart, fucking kidney thing that would be very curable nowadays, she died of at 25, 26.  The only reason I'm here, he remarried five or six years after the death of his first wife.  Right.  And had six kids, my brothers and sisters.  And in his world, he says it just makes sense now. 
[00:44:00]  At the time, he didn't think it made sense at all.  He, you know, cursed God like, why would you do this to me?  But in the end, when he became an older man, he told me, yeah, it all just makes sense now.  Hey, let me tell you, and I think what this guy was talking about, too, I'm going to guess you're in a very roundabout way you're talking about being sober, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think what it was, was, you know, I believed, you know, organized religion was kind of bullshit, you know, as far as, I mean, I realized that, yeah, they do a lot of good, and, you know, and it does good for some people. 
[00:44:30]  So, um, it wasn't doing good for me.  I was like Anthony.  Anthony, uh, I just thought I kind of, uh, or kind of like what Anthony was saying, you know, I, I had nice stuff, and, and, and I kind of was thinking, like, it was more due to me.  And so there's a difference between, hold on two seconds, there's a difference between looking at what you have and going like, ah, the life, I love the life of luxury, and I love what I have. 
[00:45:00]  And, and, and, and, like, being appreciative without the pride aspect of it, that's probably the one thing I try to pay attention to the most is not having that pride that goes along with achievement.  Um, I, I, it's, it's one of, I think, the worst things you can have.  Uh, you do have to be humble, and you do have to appreciate without thinking that it was all you, uh, that, that got you to where, where you are. 
[00:45:30]  You, you are, and, um, you know, that's the, that's the tough part, and that's the part of contrition, I think, that I can appreciate, is, is, uh, not having that, that pride part of it.  And people that know religion way more than us, uh, Christina in Boston writes, Anne is right, the Bible says God knows what's in your heart.  We should just say the Lord's Prayer as an act of, uh, humility slash meditation.  Yeah, I mean, even the Bible, it's not to knock it, I mean, I'm sure it's got some great messages and thoughts. 
[00:46:00]  But that, and again, I know some religious scholar will kill me, because I'm not 100%.  It was, I believe it was, the, the stories in the Bible were voted on, I think, 300 years or whatever it was, after Christ was dead.  And that's how, it was just a way to organize and so the religion had a book.  Uh, and that was the one that they voted on, which were the most popular readings in the sermons.  So, there's a lot of stories that were written, and a lot of, that just didn't make it in.  Oh, boy. 
[00:46:30]  A lot of stuff.  That's like the DVD extras.  Dude, that's exactly what it's like.  The director's cast.  Can you imagine how bad those fucking stories are?  But, so, it's like, I give the Bible a certain amount of, but people that stick to it like it's the word and that's it.  It's like, you're basically saying that people who voted 300 years after, whatever they say goes.  They were the big cheese.  For eternity.  Crash was dead for 300 years.  Yeah.  The message might have been a little skewed by that point, don't you think?  Yeah.  I've been thinking that I need some stupid spirituality in my life lately, so this is a good conversation. 
[00:47:00]  Spirituality.  I'm more of an earth guy.  I think it's in Britain or somewhere that they brought back some crazy, not, I shouldn't say crazy, but some old ancient religion and decided to acknowledge this religion.  After, after, I don't know how many years of saying that's a ridiculous religion, they finally came.  Maybe someone can help me out with this one, too.  They said, you know what?  No, we're going to acknowledge this religion.  And it's an old school one where they, I don't know, it's earth, sun, trees.  Like the Druids? 
[00:47:30]  I don't know.  Now I need to know a little more about this.  It was just a quick blurb on Wins when I was coming home over the weekend.  They said this ancient religion that people just wouldn't acknowledge forever, they're going to acknowledge.  And then the depressing part is, you know, in the end, there's probably nothing.  Honestly, as a smart guy, I think it's probably just this thing that nature put in us, this need to have a God because we have no natural enemies.  Right.  So being the dominant alpha power, there's nothing that can step on us. 
[00:48:00]  So what motivates us to be good and not total barbarians is looking forward and going, aha, it's afterward.  There's something after that I have to behave now.  Right.  Or else, you know, and you're right, it would be just total anarchy, people running around, raping, pillaging, everything else.  Yeah, that prevents a lot of people from doing some fucked up shit.  Right, because the people can only make their own laws and enforce them so well that you need this higher power with these laws that you must adhere to or else you will pay any next life.  And it's called druidry. 
[00:48:30]  Druidry.  They brought back druidry.  The druids, right.  The druids is now being acknowledged.  Druidism.  It was alive and well on Everquest, my friend.  Yeah?  Of course.  Well, now they're acknowledging it's a real religion again.  So there you go, Sandman.  Thank you, brother.  The druids.  We're going back to that crash down in Georgia that killed the pastor and a bunch of followers.  Jeff in Ohio.  Jeff?  Yeah, reports have it right before the tire blew, they were playing Jesus Take the Wheel on the radio.  Oh, no. 
[00:49:00]  We destroyed that song when it first came out.  What a ridiculous song.  Who was that?  Was that Carrie Underwood?  Yeah, one of them.  One of those came up with the religious song.  This guy's saying we're atheists.  We're atheists.  That's what we sound like.  Atheists?  No.  Kirby in Canada.  We don't sound like atheists, you dummy.  Atheists are just like, there's nothing, there's no one, that's it.  We're confused.  You live here, you're a biological fucking fixture on this rock, and then you just wither and die. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, I mean, I don't just blindly follow an organized religion.  Yeah, it doesn't make any atheist.  I always question what was being said to me in the church.  Yes.  Whatever.  Okay.  We can move on.  We should take a break, Anne, and do a little Jocktober before Jim Brewer gets in here.  Like a Brayton, eat my sandwich.  We're going to do Jocktober before Brewer gets here at 8 o'clock, and also Andy Rooney. 
[00:50:00]  We haven't talked about Andy Rooney in a while.  What's he up to?  He hates cars and all the gadgets in them.  This old fucking fossil.  Goddamn.  Why would you hate gadgets in your car?  I don't know.  I'm good with a choke.  I like pulling the choke.  And I like crank starting the car from the front.  And the radiator cap that blows off steam.  Don't you hate when you're in traffic and your horse starts shitting onto your sneakers? 
[00:50:30]  And you're yelling, giddy up.  I like wheels with wooden spokes.  Well, he's old.  He really is ancient.  Don't you hate when a Negro walks past you with a thing of molasses in his hand?  Andy, that was so long ago.  Well, save it.  We'll do Andy Rooney right after the break.  Andy Rooney.  We're going to do it right after the break, and then we're going to go into Jocktober. 
[00:51:00]  There's a love-hate relationship going on with this Jocktober.  Really?  People that hate it really hate it enough that they're turning off our channel.  But then on Twitter, man, there seems to be just a shitload of people that are just loving it.  We love talking about these jocks.  Commenting on them.  I think it just brings material to our show.  Of course it does.  We're going to do a little Jocktober.  I mean, we're convinced that in the end it's good for everybody.  Love it.  It's spiritual.  So we will continue with Jocktober on the Opie and Anthony show, and we're going to do that next. 
[00:51:30]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Leaving a sudden train only yesterday.  You lied.  Promises of what I seem to be only lost in time.  Throw by all of these things he said to me.  Getting ready for Jocktober for today. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  Where's Sam?  We need Sam because he's studying these horrible radio shows across America.  Oh, boy.  I can't wait to see him come sprinting down the hall with his wacky penguin feet.  Here he goes.  Look at his run.  What a girly run.  His legs.  It looks like he's going to trip over them.  Oh, my God.  He's got a notebook and everything.  Oh, no.  He's taking us a little seriously.  Yeah.  You absolutely take Jocktober very seriously there, Sam.  It's important to take things seriously. 
[00:52:30]  It sure is.  What are you going to do with your hair?  What do you mean?  Like, the Afro War thing was...  Years ago.  Years ago.  Right.  That's true.  And it's the only reason you really did that.  You kept it pretty tight before that.  Yeah, it was real short.  Why have you decided to just let it go?  There is shit flying out now from the sides and, like, from that big puff on the back 
[00:53:00]  of your head.  Yeah.  So, what's the end game here with that?  I don't know what the end game is.  Can you at least trim it?  You like your hair longer now.  Yeah, but I like it like this now.  So, you just want to keep growing it?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't have any end game.  I don't have any...  Yeah, you got some kind of OCD.  I love it.  Do you ever take the...  Whatever it is that's holding that planet on the back of your head, do you ever take  it off?  Okay, there we go.  Look at...  Oh, my God.  Look at the dust that's coming off it. 
[00:53:30]  There's so much fucking hair.  Holy shit.  All right.  It's exactly like...  Oh, my God.  It's exactly like the kid in the boondocks fucking...  Wow.  That is the worst hair ever.  Well, it's not bad.  It's horrible.  I hope it gets caught in something.  It's distinctive.  Yeah, but you can't even push it down.  It just pops right back up.  I spend like 45 minutes in the shower on Sunday just getting all dead hair out because it  knots up.  So, I got to like, you know...  It knots up.  Why would you do that?  It's awful.  I like it.  You don't like it.  I do.  I like it long.  Let me see the back. 
[00:54:00]  It's kind of getting really dready.  Why doesn't your neck hair grow?  I guess you're not old enough yet.  How long since you shaved?  How long since you shaved?  That's an older guy thing.  Fuck, you start discovering hair growing everywhere.  Young Sam doesn't have that problem, yes.  You know, I shaved the back of my neck.  Even his cock is glistening.  Thank you.  It's glistening.  Thank you very much.  As if castor oil has been poured on it.  Fall bag like a clam shell.  Yeah.  A smooth, little nervous sweat.  Nervous.  I think the last time I... 
[00:54:30]  Oh, it was October of...  Oh, Danny, do you remember what year we started in Afro Wars?  It had to be...  Three years ago.  It had to be 07, yeah.  It had to be 07.  So you haven't had a haircut in three years.  But now I think it's some kind of OCD thing that you just...  You can't cut it.  You can't trim it.  You can't do nothing.  Yeah, well, I mean...  There's something in your head now.  Because...  Why wouldn't you trim it up?  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit.  How would I trim it?  I mean, what would I do?  Well, that's a very good question.  We're not fucking hairdressers. 
[00:55:00]  Mars is a hairdresser, should we ask him?  Yeah.  Because that worked out so well last time.  Plus, if something goes wrong and they trim it and I don't like it, then I have no alternative  but to cut it short.  And then if I decide I want it long again, that's three years.  Well, but...  It's been an investment.  But you had it short forever.  Yeah.  But I like it like this.  What about your...  That's not a bad idea.  Do a Pauly D.  Pauly D.  Why don't you?  I'll give you six bucks.  Six bucks?  Six bucks. 
[00:55:30]  What about your lovely lady?  How does she feel when you take that out?  Oh, she doesn't like it out.  I keep it back almost all the time.  So...  But you do understand what you have is not even close to a ponytail.  No.  No, yeah.  I wouldn't associate it as a ponytail.  It's like a conjoined twin head.  Like you have a conjoined twin head on your head.  Yeah.  It's bizarre.  And that piece right here is longer than the piece there.  Yeah.  That piece is annoying me right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  It's deceiving because he has such curly hair.  Like pull one of those curls to show how long the hair has gotten in three years.  It's pretty long.  Unbelievable.  Plus, like the end, you know, see everything's knotted.  It's all frizzy and knotted.  Rip it off.  What, do you just rip knots out of your hair?  Yeah, that's what Jessica gets really upset about.  They're a little...  And you hear like...  And then, plus, like, I'll, you know, roll it up so it gets into a ball so it's not like  loose hairs.  And then I'll just put it on like, on a table.  And I'll be like, okay, I'll get to it when I get up. 
[00:56:30]  And then I'll leave it there.  You're just leaving.  He's saving his hair, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  You got in a shoebox, all these little balls that you pulled out of your head.  He's pulling his ends out and rolling them and leaving them laying around.  Now, there's something in his head now.  Yeah.  Wish it was a bullet.  I could identify that shit.  Now he's to the point where he...  There's something that is preventing him from getting it trimmed or cut completely off.  It's called being an ass.  That's the psychological...  That's the official psychological term.  Are you just an ass?  Sam is a hoarder of asinine hair. 
[00:57:00]  All right, Sam.  Let's move into Jocktober.  Yeah.  Okay.  We've got a busy show today.  Unlike yesterday where we kind of just like...  Tying it back up?  Yeah.  Well, I don't want to distract you guys.  No, thank you.  Busy show today.  Yesterday, we stretched everything just to get to, you know, the end of the show.  It wasn't because the segment was good?  Oh, there's suggestions from Kurt Love here.  Maybe you should condition it with Bob Kelly semen.  I wouldn't do that.  It would probably moisturize it a little bit.  I mean, it could, but then I would have to extract the semen, which would...  Golf, enjoy it.  No, just let it crust up and then pull the hair out with the semen on it and leave it 
[00:57:30]  laying around your house.  With little flakes on it.  Yes.  Good point from Boston BD.  He writes, Sam won't trim his hair after three years, but had no problem trimming his  cock after 20.  Oh, man.  Right.  Number one.  Very good point.  With a little hole in it.  It was 19 years.  And number two, that's a, you know, that's a medical procedure.  It's not a trimming.  And Eric in Boston has a question for you.  Eric. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Sam, do you clean up downstairs?  I have curly hair, too, and I kind of do that.  Do you clean up nice downstairs?  I mean, that's really none of your concerns, sir.  But, you know, I wouldn't...  Same consistency?  Do you tie it in a fucking rubber band down there, too?  It gets just as long.  And I have this giant fucking powder puff above your cock?  Do you?  Hold on.  Yes.  Hold on.  I got to record it.  I like hearing my own voice. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Eric.  Let's move into Jocktober.  Where's the intro to Jocktober?  It's Jocktober.  Yeah!  This is awesome.  A celebration of fantastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  Great.  Come on.  Thank you.  So turn up this turntacular radio.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Yes!  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Sam?  Yeah.  What do we got today? 
[00:59:00]  Well, we're going to get hot in the AM this morning.  AM?  That's right.  Well, it's not an AM station.  Oh, I thought you meant amplitude modulation.  That's not a bad idea, though.  But that's the...  Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.  That's the station's catchphrase.  Hot in the AM?  Yeah.  All I thought was AM, like, shitty reception and can't get it in a tunnel.  That's all I was thinking.  That's terrible.  You can get it in a tunnel now.  AM?  Mm-hmm.  1010 winds fades out in the Midtown Tunnel.  Did you get it, though?  Yeah, but it's bare. 
[00:59:30]  No, honestly, I think after 9-11 they made it where you could get some AMs in the tunnels  and certainly you could get cell service.  I get 88, but I don't get winds in the Midtown Tunnel.  They fucked it up.  It's too close to, like, I think this frequency that takes care of, like, the tunnel business.  Oh, okay.  So I'll be listening to, you know, and weather will be...  We're going to be building and cleaning the walls, so escape away from the tunnel tonight 
[01:00:00]  at 8.  What the fuck?  Put on 88 anyway.  Fuck it.  Well, this looks good.  Yes.  Hot in the AM, okay.  We're going all the way to Evansville, Indiana.  Where the hell is that?  It's in Indiana.  Is it close to, like, somewhere I know in Indiana?  It's probably near...  Is it by Gary?  Indianapolis.  Yeah.  Probably.  You're just saying that.  Yeah, but what's far from Indianapolis?  It's Indiana.  What difference does it make?  Safe bet.  Evansville.  It's the morning show with Adam Smasher and Shonda. 
[01:00:30]  Why does Adam Smasher sound familiar?  Well, I mean...  Have we looked at him before?  His name is Adam Smasher.  See, what's funny is it's not even, like, a play on Atom Smasher, as in it was A-D-A-M  Smasher.  Right.  He literally named himself A-T-O-M Smasher.  Oh, oh, so it's not Atom Smasher.  No, it's Atom.  It's Atom.  So he is literally an Atom Smasher.  It doesn't even make any sense.  He smashes Atoms in the morning. 
[01:01:00]  Ah, I listen to Atom Smasher.  He's my favorite.  See, if it were Atom Smasher, it would be like, oh, his name sounds like an Atom Smasher.  But he's actually Atom.  He is actually Atom.  He's not Atom.  He's Atom.  His parents named him A-T-O-M.  Atom.  Well, they didn't.  You don't think so?  No.  Can I then...  Mr. and Mrs. Smasher?  Does he drive in a hydro accelerator?  Yes.  He goes around in circles.  Can I guess, um...  Is he...  Watch out, though. 
[01:01:30]  He has a neck tattoo, guys.  Of course he's wild.  He's got a neck tattoo.  Wow.  You don't fuck with people with neck tattoos, ever.  He's pretty hardcore, and he gets his opinions out there, and he kind of gets down like a  real guy.  Thank God for Shaunda.  Atoms.  Oh, Shaunda takes him down.  Yeah, well, she's...  What's she about?  She's kind of like, come on, like...  Is she a...  In person.  No, I don't...  In person.  Oh, my God.  Not that I'm aware of.  I don't think so.  Shaunda.  Does she keep the guys from getting too crazy?  Yeah, he's like...  Because Adam Smasher sometimes gets ahead of himself, and she has to be like, let's reel 
[01:02:00]  it in.  Come on.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Shaunda absolutely is.  In person.  Okay, well, all right.  I don't see in terms of color sometimes.  In person.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a picture of them back-to-back?  Yeah, just kind of like...  Back-to-back, standing there like...  He said, she said.  Right.  Standing their ground.  Love that.  Did I tell you the worst suggestion ever was my agent, Pete?  We were talking about book titles one time.  I was going to write a thing on relationships, and someone said something like, he said, she 
[01:02:30]  said, and I didn't like that, or maybe it's already done, and Pete goes, well, how about  he said, he said?  Like, if it's all my opinion, if I have no girl saying it.  Did you just punch him in the face?  I just got uncomfortable and hung up.  How about he said, he said?  Sounds like you're in a gay relationship.  Dude, it's horrendous.  It does sound like you're doing a relationship.  It does just sound like a gay relationship.  How about he said, he said, Pete's fired.  Pete's fired.  Oh, he has a couple of doozies. 
[01:03:00]  Wow.  Was that indeed Shawanda, or...  Shawanda.  How come now she became Shawanda?  I don't know, because we see that she is an in-person.  Oh, we might as well make it...  Now she's not?  Is she white now?  It's spelled like that.  It's definitely S-H-A-W-N-D-A.  Well, we'll know when we hear her voice.  I mean, I don't think it's that cut and dry.  I will know when I hear her voice.  Evansville is in the middle of nowhere. 
[01:03:30]  For a reference point.  I think the blonde is her.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I think that's her.  Shawanda McNeil.  I guess that explains why there's not a lot of pictures of her on the website.  She's not a pretty girl, Dan?  Not a looker.  Dan, is she not a pretty gal?  If her picture's in black and white, and it's the year 2010, you make your own...  People are entitled to their own opinion.  Well, put it this way.  I can't find a picture of her that's bigger than thumbnail size.  Oh, see?  That's not good, either.  She's married.  She has a kid.  So does Anthem Smasher.  By the way, we're broadcasting across this fine nation of ours, Sam. 
[01:04:00]  You were way off.  Evansville is 150 miles from Indianapolis.  That's really not that far.  Oh, that's just a stone's throw.  Exactly.  Two and a half hour drive.  Yeah, that's nothing.  Oh, God.  She's not that bad.  She's okay.  She's all right.  She's probably a heft.  She's got a little heft to her.  Adam Smasher is a stupid name.  That's the picture that you can find.  You know what I'm saying?  Of course, she looks like she's in a diner, too.  Way to go, fucking piggy. 
[01:04:30]  She's leaning on her hand, probably laughing as the cheese fries are empty.  Wearing a scarf to wipe her mouth with.  Well, Sam, we're ready.  Fucking napkin.  Let's rock this, then.  Atom.  Atoms.  Atoms.  Smasher.  Atom.  And Shonda on Evansville, Indiana's Hot 96.  Keeping it hot in the AM.  What is Hot 96 all about?  They are a top 40 station, but they are more urban than some other top 40 stations.  They definitely sneak in a little of the hip hop that a lot of top 40 stations do not. 
[01:05:00]  So they're talking to?  In person.  I don't know who they're talking to.  I know they're talking to us this morning.  Okay.  W, people.  Here's today's Jocktober.  The show talks about keeping up with the Kardashians and talk about who's the hottest.  We've talked about the Kardashians before.  We sure have.  A little pop culture.  A little pop culture for everybody.  Relatable.  More amazing than that is the fact that I'm trying to play it off like I actually watched football yesterday. 
[01:05:30]  You know what you were watching?  Probably the same thing I was watching.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  What's wrong?  Wow.  You were watching the same thing I was watching.  Oh my God.  Does she have a great whole voice or what?  That's Shonda.  That's Shonda.  Oof.  More amazing than that is the fact that I'm trying to play it off like I actually watched football yesterday.  You know what you were watching?  Probably the same thing I was watching back and forth.  Uh, what's that? 
[01:06:00]  The E specials.  Did you watch all the E specials yet?  Oh my God.  She's happy.  Why wouldn't you just belt her in the face?  That's all you hear, right?  Just a buzzing noise.  Something in a frying pan.  Tell her to go cook something.  Clang.  Right across her fucking chin.  How much did that hurt?  Oh, the top teeth.  Oh, yeah.  Just hit the top teeth.  With the side, you do it sideways with the fucking side of the frying pan. 
[01:06:30]  Side twice.  Evansville is the birthplace of someone very famous in baseball.  Oh.  Well.  Do, do.  Oh, I know.  Do, do, do.  Did he have two bad knees?  No.  Marv Gresto.  Did you make a Mike Schmidt reference?  Yes, I did.  Uh, uh, Travis, if, uh, if you will, please.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  I was Dayton, Ohio.  With two very bad knees. 
[01:07:00]  What else?  In a dream to become a major league baseball player.  What, what happened?  Don't sound like a bitch.  Get it out.  I thank God the dream came true.  Oh, did you see that jerk?  Funny every time.  God, is that a bad clip to chase you around?  Donnie baseball, right?  Don Mattingly.  Don Mattingly is from Evansville. 
[01:07:30]  I didn't know that.  He also hit a bad, who gets the credit today?  He had a bad back.  Nobody, because he did it from his self-dream.  Yeah.  Bad back.  Seven home runs in his last season.  And, and he, he leaves teams right, right before they're ready to win championships.  What's wrong with this guy?  I was, I was getting a hot dog, his last Yankee Stadium home run.  Yeah.  In a playoff game against the Mariners.  Ruben Sierra and him went back, two back.  Oh.  And they won an amazing 15 inning game.  And you've rationalized it into, that it was a hot dog? 
[01:08:00]  No, it wasn't.  I swear it was a hot dog.  Yes, I wasn't in the urinal.  And Hawkeye smothered a chicken.  How many years did he play for the Yankees?  Um, I don't know.  Fourteen.  Six months?  Oh.  Fourteen years.  Fourteen years, no titles.  He leaves and then the Yankees win.  How many in the, since?  He's a good player, though.  Oh, a couple.  How many World Series since Mattingly left?  It has to be two or three.  He obviously was holding back the team. 
[01:08:30]  Five or six.  Five or six after he leaves.  Buck Showalter also left in 95.  The last series he managed, I believe, was that Mariners series, which the Yankees won the first two and then lost the final three in Seattle.  And I think he overmanaged a lot.  And I think Torrey coming in the next year helped.  94 was the strike.  And that was, the Yankees were supposed to win.  They were good that year, too.  Fuck.  94 was a good year for the Yankees.  Yeah, I think there were six games in front of Toronto when the strike hit, if I remember correctly.  Wow.  Okay.  All right, let's get back into this. 
[01:09:00]  It's Atom.  Oh, please.  Atom Smasher.  Yes.  More amazing than that is the fact that I'm trying to play it off like I actually watched football yesterday.  You know what you were watching?  Probably the same thing I was watching back and forth.  What's that?  The E-specials.  Did you watch all the E-specials yesterday?  Oh, with the Keeping Up with the Kardashians?  Oh, yeah, I did watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  They had a complete marathon all day yesterday.  It was awesome.  I never really got into Keeping Up.  Didn't you hear that she's just holding everyone back? 
[01:09:30]  He almost sounds like he would have a good show.  He sounds like he's disgusted.  Right.  Like, oh, yeah, I didn't watch that.  Oh, yeah, I did watch that.  Yeah, whatever.  And in all fairness, a lot of these radio guys are forced to have holes.  He might be one of these guys that is forced to have a hole.  Wow.  And name himself Atom Smasher?  Atom.  All right, maybe that's not the greatest name.  I never really got into Keeping Up with the Kardashians until recently, just because,  God, Kim is so hot.  And I got to tell you what, the mother, I think she's hot. 
[01:10:00]  That's what Dave said.  Oh, Chris is hot.  I don't know how old she is, but I don't...  Who the fuck is Dave?  Yeah, Sam.  Who's Dave?  Dave is her husband.  That's what Dave said.  Her husband.  Oh, her husband and her husband.  Yeah, that's what Dave says.  That eunuch.  Oh, you think she's a eunuch?  First of all, yeah, oh, the mother's hot.  Meanwhile, he's looking at the younger daughter.  Can't say a word, or else she'll get all fucking offended. 
[01:10:30]  Or Bruce Jenner's fucking burn victim face.  Poor Bruce.  That burn victim hairdo, that wig, whatever it is.  I'll bet you fucking Dave's a man's man.  And I'll bet you fucking he told Fatso he thought she was hot while he was shitting  and she was licking his ball bag.  I'll bet you Dave was getting an almost blumpkin and she was smelling his fucking, his chili  shits while he talked about how hot the Kardashians are.  Yeah, she failed to mention what they were doing.  Exactly.  Dave said that she's hot. 
[01:11:00]  While she was kneeling there like a fucking fat porpoise, putting her nose in his ball bag.  Had a boy, Dave.  I think she's hot.  That's what Dave said.  Oh, Chris is hot.  I don't know how old she is, but I don't care if she's had plastic surgery.  She is sexy and she is a cougar.  And we all like cougars, right?  We just all love the cougar.  If you're into cougars, you've got like a fetish.  It's a fetish that's the, you know, whatever you're into, I don't give a shit. 
[01:11:30]  But don't make it sound like everybody's, Uncle Paul.  Don't make it sound like everybody's like, wow, cougars.  Because most guys don't like the fucking cougars.  You don't think Kim Kardashian's mom is hot?  Punch up a picture of her.  She was, I met her one.  I did a letter with her and saw her in person.  She's not bad.  She's not going to get you work.  She's not an old, no, I'm not as old as a woman.  That's not my thing.  But she's not an ugly woman.  She's just a little older for me.  Of course she's not ugly.  Look what she pushed out of her vagina. 
[01:12:00]  Just saying.  Look what fell out of her cunt.  Oh, yeah.  While she was jogging.  Yeah, when you're looking at the daughters and then there's her there, you're not going  to, look, stop it.  Then she's a pretty woman, though, man.  She looks like fucking, what's her name from Three's Company?  Joyce DeWitt.  Joyce DeWitt.  Yeah, but know what you got to do?  You got to get older pictures of her to see where she was at because she's got all the  fucking Hollywood plastic surgeries.  Time goes by.  It's over, Johnny.  But she's fucking up with the Botox and everything else.  That shit's over.  What did she used to look like?  Fuck what she used to look like.  What about her kids now?  They're fine. 
[01:12:30]  She hasn't pumped out one ugly daughter yet.  She's five for five.  Yeah, but it was all with fucking Robert Kardashian, wasn't it?  She had two daughters with Bruce.  How old are they?  They're already modeling and all that shit.  Are they?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're going to be the next show that this woman pushes out there for all of us.  They're those 16-year-olds that are in there.  They're 16?  Yeah, they do, but they're still doing the bikini and little underpants modeling.  Right.  The daughter she had with Bruce Jenner, they're hot, too. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah?  Absolutely.  Yes.  Wow.  Yes.  I'll investigate that.  Oh, yeah.  She's hot.  Get out of here.  What a frump.  She probably...  She was hot in her day, I'm sure.  Yeah, who wasn't?  And as far as an older woman goes, she's hot.  I don't know.  Cougars look a lot worse than that.  Cougars are all just fucking yuck.  The problem with cougars...  How about the cougars?  The problem with cougars, their asses smell an hour after they shower. 
[01:13:30]  If the younger girl could shower and their ass will smell nice all night...  It's like cotton candy and homework.  But as soon as the cougar showers, within an hour, their ass is already smelling.  Oh, you're right.  What are the physics behind that?  Jimmy just said, oh, you're right.  He knows.  Their back sweat leaks into their ass crack.  From the hot flashes and estrogen.  And their bra strap is too tight, trying to hold their bar in, and it causes a rivet,  a divot in their back, and it channels their back sweat right into their fucking hiney crack. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, God.  A 17-year-old girl could, I don't know, shower in the morning, go to cheerleading practice.  She could do all sorts of shit, and everything's smelling nice right to the end of the day.  But a cruder, within an hour, things start smelling.  At that age, a girl could be running while on her period with a shit ponytailing out,  and her pussy would still smell good.  What is that about?  I know what it's about.  It's all about moisture.  You got moisture, you know, constantly flowing through everything, it's fine.  That's why toilet bowls have water in them. 
[01:14:30]  You know, you take a shit, it's better than a dry fucking toilet or a spackle bucket.  You notice how that stinks a lot more?  Oh, yeah.  Of course it does.  So the moisture kind of keeps the scent at bay.  Diludes it.  Right.  At bay.  And then you get a hold of it at bay.  And then you get the old chicks, the cougars, they're a little dry.  All right.  Let's get back to Atom Smasher.  Atom and Shonda.  And now they're trying to have a second baby.  They're trying. 
[01:15:00]  Kim is the sexiest.  Chris is the cougar.  Courtney is, she's definitely hot.  She's super cute.  And Chloe looks most like a man.  She does not.  Because they got a pee, too, you know?  Adam and Shonda are coming right back on Hot 96.  That's how they ended that second?  Wow.  Yeah.  She is not.  She is not.  Don't go.  Yeah, it ended with a bang.  Wow.  Is she the definitive hole?  Yes, she is.  Just that is the definition of the hole. 
[01:15:30]  Keep him quiet.  Hey, no.  Oh.  I mean, that was a little kind of on the mean side for Atom.  Below the belt.  Atom.  Atom Smasher.  Atom Smasher.  Hey, Sam, could we get the listeners helping you out?  I want a whole montage of holes for this Jocktober.  Yeah, you can send your favorite holes to primetime.  My favorite was last year when we did Jocktober, we followed one holes contribution to the show.  Oh, we isolated.  We isolated everything she said all morning, and there was nothing above a, oh, my. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  A lot of teeth sucking.  Nothing of substance.  Just, oh, guys.  Come on.  Mouth.  Do we still have that?  It's been a year since we played it.  Maybe E-Rock can find it.  E-Rock is our librarian.  Yeah.  He really is.  He is.  That's his job.  He's a show librarian.  E-Rock has just become a librarian for the show.  That's true.  That's his job.  That's it.  I am the curator of the O.P. and Anthony Archives.  All right, so they went to break there pretty impressively. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, I mean, you want to hit them with something solid.  Is that true that E-Rock uses the dummy decimal system in his library?  Oh, come on.  Oh, no.  Come on.  That's not what it's called.  What is that?  Is it then because he eats so much, the chewy decimal system?  Oh.  Is that what E-Rock's using?  Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  Maybe his ass and bald skin sweat so much, it's the gooey decimal system. 
[01:17:00]  The gooey decimal system.  Oh, shit.  Or he stands there eating grass, it's the mooey decimal system.  Oh, come on.  Maybe because, well, he did have that problem with the oral hygiene.  It could be the pewy decimal system.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  Or maybe it's Rick Sanchez, he does the gooey decimal system.  Who knows?  Just look in the tarred catalogs and see what comes up.  E-Rock does the baby Huey decimal system.  He's probably hearing, well, he's probably not hearing this, actually.  Does he hate that Steve got fired? 
[01:17:30]  Oh, of course.  Well, he doesn't know you make fun of him as much as you do.  He's taking naps.  It wasn't a firing, but you know what I'm saying.  It might as well have been.  Oh, okay.  No, he takes naps whenever it gets tough.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's.  The stewey decimal system.  Stew.  Let's get back to Jacktober.  See, I don't have a clueey decimal system.  The dumb as a pool cueey decimal system.  Oh, no.  It'll go all day.  Yeah.  Back to Jacktober. 
[01:18:00]  What's going on there?  With Atom Smasher.  Atom.  Atom.  They do a story, I guess.  Story.  That's my story.  Okay.  They do a story about some parents duct taping their toddler.  Shonda feels bad.  Why?  Oh.  There you go.  There's the picture.  The parents are in trouble.  Oh, poor thing.  They should be in trouble.  Who was she?  Exactly.  She had her face with her fucking heart-breaking photos.  With her Krispy Kreme box.  She was licking the pieces that, like, that stay in the box after the donut box is empty. 
[01:18:30]  She was pulling fucking mustache crumbs out of her face.  She was bent over doing her own nails, toenails.  Why are you doing that?  Off the mic.  Yeah.  She had to jump in.  There you go.  There's the picture.  The parents are in trouble.  Oh, poor thing.  Maybe she's bulimic and she was throwing up her breakfast.  That way's bad.  Puking.  Oh, they need me. 
[01:19:00]  There you go.  There's the picture.  The parents are in trouble.  Oh, poor thing.  They should be in trouble.  What they're calling heartbreaking photos.  22-month-old toddler stuck to the wall in his home by duct tape after his mother had been partying with her boyfriend at her home in Lincoln, Nebraska.  She's 18.  Nice.  And I guess they thought it would, you know, be funny. 
[01:19:30]  They taunted him.  It's not fucking Shatner delivered.  You know why?  Because he fucking hates Shonda.  He's distracted.  Yeah.  I got this figured out.  I feel bad for Atom.  And it was Atom?  Atom Smasher doesn't want to be doing this type of radio.  She's 18 years old and doesn't quite know how to party like, right?  Sometimes you got to keep him from jostling around.  Duct tape him?  Yeah.  Yeah, it works well.  To the wall. 
[01:20:00]  To the wall?  How do you duct tape him to a wall?  You got to face him to the wall and then you just put tape around him.  Oh, that's not good.  Facing him to the wall, Uncle Paul.  You put him about two feet up.  Oh, God.  No.  Uncle Paul.  Make yourself a treat.  They taunted him and it's really sad by taping his favorite drinking cup just outside of 
[01:20:30]  his reach.  Sardino.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  And the poor thing is like hanging off of the tape.  So he's trying to see where he's obviously trying to get.  And that must have hurt his arms.  Sam, where's this picture?  I didn't read ahead, but I have to say it.  What's that?  This is a bit.  You think it's going somewhere?  It's such a bit.  What are they doing?  There is a second track to this story.  There is more audio of them covering this story. 
[01:21:00]  You don't think they're being...  The sippy cup just had a...  Stop.  You don't think it's a real thing?  No.  That must hurt his arms.  What do they do?  Put him up on Facebook afterwards?  Probably.  Oh, yeah.  That's probably what they got busted.  You're going to get in trouble for that.  All right?  You're going to get in trouble for that.  And they used some kind of duct tape, but it wasn't even...  If you're going to use duct tape, use the correct kind of duct tape. 
[01:21:30]  What is that?  It's a green decorative tape?  You should see this duct tape.  It's ridiculous.  When I want to duct tape Ryder to punish him, I go to one source.  Hi!  Dead Billy Mays here?  Oh, no.  You got it right, Ovi.  It went right to a bit.  All right.  Know why?  Because he couldn't sell it.  Like, when you said the William Shatner delivery, I started thinking, wait a minute.  Why is he not selling this story?  If you've got a story like that, it's so easy to do. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  He wasn't believing in his own bit.  Or was he trying to lead to this dumb bit?  I...  I...  Was there a bit, and then it leads to another bit?  No.  They just brought up the story.  This guy's mysterious.  Yeah.  It's him.  I go to one source.  Hi!  Dead Billy Mays here!  Is your toddler tearing a hole in your social life?  Then you need toddler tape!  Toddler tape is perfect for when no one wants to babysit your brat!  Whether you want to go shopping, check out your favorite band, or for no reason at all, 
[01:22:30]  toddler tape secures any kid to any wall.  And if you order now, I'll include absolutely free Mouthy Putty.  The perfect way to make sure children are seen, but not heard.  So take it from me, Dead Billy Mays.  Toddler tape.  Just like a child endangerment charge, it sticks.  There you go, Shonda.  It sticks.  You know what's funny?  Billy Mays is like the Tupac of infomercials. 
[01:23:00]  He keeps coming out with stuff.  It's like a never-ending commercial.  Can we hear that genuine laugh again?  Wow.  No one laughs.  I've never laughed like that.  Did you hear the joke?  It's funny.  Billy Mays is like the Tupac of infomercials.  He keeps coming out with stuff.  It's like a never-ending commercial.  God, I hate the fucking laughing stunt guy. 
[01:23:30]  Was that Atom?  That was Atom laughing.  Was that Atom Smasher?  Oh yeah, that was Atom.  Why would he laugh at that?  Because it's like Tupac kept coming out with records,  and now Billy Mays is still doing infomercials even though he's passed on.  No, maybe that was.  Maybe there was something we couldn't see.  You know what I mean?  Like maybe as she was saying that, a fucking mouse ran into the room.  She jumped up on the chair.  Poor Atom. 
[01:24:00]  Atom.  Atom.  Atom.  That's what she did.  She ate him.  One guy just writes, that's why I pay for radio.  Well, I think this is why we do Jocktober.  That is so funny.  We're great and everyone else sucks.  That's it.  That's what we're trying to tell the world.  That's the lesson.  We make fun of people for no reason because we're better than them.  That's right, Sam.  You've learned well.  So do they talk to Ralphie May after he laughed like that? 
[01:24:30]  Atom, Smasher, and Schwanda on Evansville, Indiana's.  What?  Shonda, not Schwanda.  We can't pronounce her name.  Schwanda.  What did Anthony call her?  Shawanda.  And what's her name, Shawanda?  It's Shawanda.  All right, from Indiana's Hot 96.  They talk about Dog the Bounty Hunter.  Or Atom gets a little mean for Shonda.  Like Shonda, yeah, she's a little mean for him.  For her, I mean, yeah, whatever.  I want Dog to be okay.  Evidently, it was something that stemmed from an actual, you know, bounty hunt. 
[01:25:00]  Mm-hmm.  He had internal bleeding.  Internal bleeding.  He was admitted to the hospital.  He's been released now.  But, I mean, it was very scary at the beginning.  Is it called a bounty hunt or is it called...  It's called a bounty hunt.  Okay.  Or is it like a, you know...  It's called a bounty hunt.  Trailer trash hunt.  Or can we call it, like, where's Waldo and his rolling meth lab?  You are supposed to be in a good mood today.  I am in a good mood.  It's called a bounty hunt.  Okay.  Yes.  Oh, God. 
[01:25:30]  How do you put up with that all fucking day?  It's like having a bitchy girlfriend right there.  Oh, what the fuck is that?  Stop it.  Do you know what sucks?  He was obviously getting to a line and fucking...  And blimpy calves.  Fucking...  Nah, it's a bounty hunt.  It's like, do you not see he's setting up a line, even though it wasn't a good one?  She just wouldn't...  Is it called he's to be in a good mood today?  Yeah.  Oh, I was.  You showed up.  Exactly.  Fuck.  I heard you were dead like Snake Plissket. 
[01:26:00]  I was feeling great.  Let me go to John in Miami.  John.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you doing?  Good, John.  Yeah, well...  Hey, man.  Can we knock this Jack Toper stuff off?  If I want to listen to these idiots out in Indiana, I'll drive out there and listen to them.  I can't handle it, man.  Go back to talking about the church fans crashing or something.  Yeah, we're not going to do that, John.  Yeah, we're just going to talk about Jack Toper.  Yeah, we're not going to change our whole radio show because you don't like it.  We do this. 
[01:26:30]  That's why this fine satellite radio has a million channels.  John, you're supposed to be in a good mood today.  That's right.  What are you doing?  This is a good mood, man.  Oh, what are you...  Oh, now.  Hit an abutment.  Oh, come on, now.  That's mean.  Yeah, boys.  That's not nice.  All right, John.  I guess some people just hear us playing a recording and don't hear the hijinks and shenanigans between...  Well, they're called the apes.  Apes.  Yeah, they think Jack Toper and that's all they think.  Not those type of apes. 
[01:27:00]  I thought you meant something else.  People across the board, people that are just not as smart or intelligent.  That is true.  They think Jack Toper and that's all they think instead of realizing this is just bringing  material to the show.  Yeah, we're having to comment and have fun.  And even so, even if they just heard the clips, if I lived in Indiana, I would listen to Atom  Smasher every day just to hear him get fucking bulldozed by that twat.  Did you hear all the jokes we did today just because of Jack Toper?  We did the whole cougar thing. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, now.  And they're assholes smelling an hour after they shower.  Yeah.  It led to all sorts of fun...  Crispy cream donut box.  Yeah, sure.  Made fun of E-Rock for like five, seven minutes.  That wouldn't have happened if we weren't doing Jack Toper at this particular moment.  Well, there might have been a reason for it.  Yeah.  All right.  They play an excruciatingly long Dog the Bounty Hunter mullet bit.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Now I'm with that guy from Miami.  Yeah.  How are we supposed to play this clip if that's the setup, Sam? 
[01:28:00]  It's very long.  Oh, my God.  What's the first problem with it?  Well, they start with a joke.  Mm-hmm.  And then they take that joke and extend it for over 60 seconds.  Mm-hmm.  It's just, you know, they did the dog story, and so now they have to have a bit, which they  made themselves to their credit.  But unfortunately, since neither of the two of them have any sense of humor, it's devoid 
[01:28:30]  of that.  But instead of humor, they added length.  Hmm.  Oh.  Which is not generally the formula I would think would be effective for comedy bits.  Well, let's, like, try to get through this quickly, because we got Jim Brewer at 8 o'clock.  I don't think he will be able to get through it quickly.  It's long.  All right.  Excruciatingly long.  Yes.  Anthony.  I'm listening.  You ready?  Shonda, I got a hold of the 911 tape.  You did.  Yes.  And this is a very, very bone-chilling, if you will, as you can hear. 
[01:29:00]  This is for real.  As you can hear, his wife is very, very distraught over the phone.  Dog.  911 call.  911, what's your emergency?  Yes, it's my husband.  What's wrong with him, ma'am?  He's got a mullet.  Okay.  How bad is the mullet?  It's pretty bad.  All right.  First of all, Atom doesn't change his voice for a bit.  Atom does not, he cannot change his voice. 
[01:29:30]  He can't do impressions.  He's not an impressionist.  It's good they went right for mullet instead of hinting to it a little bit.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, that there was a problem, something with his head.  You know, you can make it sound like almost a head injury is happening, and then you hit  him with the mullet thing.  Right.  Oh, my God, what's the problem?  An empty boat.  What?  What do you guys think they talk about for the next minute and a half since they brought  up mullet to start with?  I don't know.  His mullet.  I'm going right for that.  Listen to him not even trying to change his voice for the bit, by the way. 
[01:30:00]  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Why didn't Atom get someone else from the station to do that part?  Maybe everybody read the script and refused.  Oh, really?  It's his bit.  He should star in it.  He sounds a little bit like Tom Green and a little bit like Joe Rogan.  Except with neither of the talent.  Of course not.  He's got a lot a bit annoyed.  What's wrong with him, ma'am?  He's got a mullet.  Okay.  How bad is the mullet?  It's pretty bad. 
[01:30:30]  It's long and curly in the back and kind of feathered at the top.  Okay, ma'am.  Calm down.  I'm going to have you help me best identify the type for medical personnel when they arrive.  Is it wavy or feathered on top?  She said feathered already.  Wavy.  Yeah, definitely wavy.  She said feathered.  Pain on mine.  I thought the same thing.  I was like, man, that 911 dispatcher sounds a lot like me.  But, you know, my voice is very generic.  Okay, ma'am.  Your husband has a carny mullet.  And I am sending out help right now. 
[01:31:00]  Is it bad?  Is he going to live?  It's pretty bad.  But we think we can help.  It's not a rat tail or anything, but, you know, could become one over time if he's not treated.  Is it back or is it in a ponytail or is it all out?  It's pulled back.  I didn't want to touch it.  Okay, I need you to let it out, but don't move it too much.  It's still going.  Okay.  It's out.  It's still going.  Wait, where are we?  But Dog has a mullet.  I just checked my Twitter. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, Dog.  I know I shouldn't be doing that, but what happened?  Dog the Bounty Hunter has a mullet, and his wife called 911.  Oh, he's supposed to be...  Wait, she's supposed to be imitating Dog the Bounty Hunter's actual wife?  That's right.  Oh, now I'm into the bed a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you see where the laughs are?  Once you know what it's all about, it's great.  Yeah.  Oh.  I mean, I just realized it had gone on for a while, and there were a lot of blank stares in here.  Everybody kind of just waiting for the noise to stop in their headphones so they could talk. 
[01:32:00]  We don't want Joe from Miami proving us wrong.  Too late.  Move it too much.  Okay.  It's out.  Now what?  Sit there with him and keep the mullet elevated.  Rescue workers are on their way.  That's very important, Shonda.  If you find yourself in a similar situation, you always want to keep the mullet elevated.  Write that down.  Because they got a P, too, you know?  Adam and Shonda are coming right back.  Oh, my. 
[01:32:30]  There was no ending to the bit.  No.  No.  Well.  The voice guy came in.  Keep the mullet elevated.  That was the punch.  That was the big kicker, the big out.  See, what happened was the show met up and said, we should do a 911 call where they call 911 because Dog has a mullet.  And then they stopped thinking after that.  Uh-huh.  And then they just recorded something.  Well, thank God we're going to move on.  You think so?  At home, Smasher, and Shonda.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Evansville.  Indiana's Hot 96.  We're almost done for the people that don't like Jacktober.  Who's that?  I don't know anybody like that, by the way.  We've got Joe Laney.  That's crazy.  We're the guy with the worst beard in history on fucking Morning Joe.  Ah!  Judah.  Judah.  Judah Freelander.  Nice.  It says, Comics Inspirational Karate Book.  Like it's real.  He can grow a beard fast, too, huh?  He really can.  I wrote a book.  Here we go.  I've gotten thousands, by the way, of Jacktober request emails. 
[01:33:30]  So enough of this.  We don't like it.  Everybody likes Jacktober.  And if you don't like it, you're in the minority.  Yeah, I think the majority likes Jacktober.  I understand.  Loves Jacktober.  I understand there's a bunch of people that don't.  No, not even a bunch.  I can like everything we do.  A small handful.  Sure.  Shonda talks about showering with her young son.  What?  They do a longer bit.  Yes.  What does that mean?  You know the dog bit?  Yeah.  They do a bit that's like a little longer.  Oh, God.  About her showering with her son?  It's about her son, yeah.  What is that about? 
[01:34:00]  Happen to have my young son in the tub.  That sounds a little inappropriate.  Does the son feel like he's showering under a sewer pipe?  Oh, jeez.  You get all the filth.  Howie and I, we will, on occasion, a couple nights a week, we will have showers together.  I want to tell you something, Shonda.  I want the soap this time first.  You get pubes in it.  Showering with Howie.  That's her two-year-old son.  Oh, it's her two-year-old son?  Oh, I thought it was Howard. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, baby Howard.  Get over here, Shonda.  Howie and I, we will, on occasion, a couple nights a week, we will take showers together  because it's a lot easier.  We both take our showers at night.  And we were showering, and Howie looked at me, and he goes,  Mommy, you have a big butt.  Ugh, gross.  Why would you say that?  It's radio. 
[01:35:00]  It's not what he said, anyway.  She said, all the better to get big black dick in.  That's inappropriate.  No?  Her son.  Any Dickens coffee around?  Yeah.  I need some Dickens coffee.  That fucking rules.  See, we would never have Dickens coffee if we didn't do Jack Tolbert.  I know.  Have Edgar Hollick bring it in.  That infuriated everybody.  Were you here for that, Jimmy?  It's not Edgar Thal.  Oh, all right.  You weren't here for that? 
[01:35:30]  That's fucking funny.  People were so fucking pissed off.  Because everyone refused to do the right goof name.  I've actually done a fucking...  I got people...  I was in a store when I was a kid, and I was like,  tell them that Mickey Hunt...  Mickey Hunt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's up front waiting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  See?  Mommy, you have a big butt.  Oh, no.  And I went, Howie.  And she said, Hey, you have a big cock. 
[01:36:00]  He goes, Howie, baby butt.  Mommy, big butt.  Oh, no.  And I could not believe it.  I'm like, what are you talking...  Where did you learn that?  Like, it's just the craziest thing, the things that come out of that kid's mouth.  Mommy, butt.  Why is that crazy?  That story sucked.  It's crazy.  Jimmy, it's cute.  It's a cute story of mother and son that can talk showering.  What a terrible fucking story.  The kid starts talking, you stop showering.  I agree.  Like, bathing a child is one thing. 
[01:36:30]  You know, you take them in the bathtub, their Uncle Paul, and whatever.  Sure.  But getting in a shower...  She said they shower together two or three times a week.  Yeah.  What's that about?  It's a lot of showering.  Showering.  Well, she has a little soap dispenser right there.  You can just shove the bar up.  Mommy, you have a fatty pubis.  Mother, your pubis is fatty.  It's just amazing what comes out of kids' mouths.  My pubic hairs. 
[01:37:00]  But we haven't heard from Ted in a while.  Ted, you used to shower with your mom?  I certainly did, Gregory.  To save water.  Yeah?  Yes.  Until I was 23 years of age.  Well, that sounds logical.  Yes.  Mother would make me wash her back a lot.  Did Mother have a big butt?  Yes, she did.  She had a lot of batonka-dunk in the trunk.  But she made me say that as I washed it.  As you washed it?  Yes.  And she noticed that I was tenting under the sun.  She would put a little bit of soap in the hole to make my tent go away. 
[01:37:30]  Theodora, this is incestuous.  Said, Mother, you've got junk in the trunk.  And then I would make little bubbles in the tub.  Would you have to towel her off?  Yes, I would.  I would dry her thoroughly.  Yeah.  While she was still in the tub.  So we could do it all over again.  After she was fired from Corvettes.  And then two guys were stealing.  Two guys?  Yes.  She worked in two guys.  Yes. 
[01:38:00]  What are the trivia?  She was stealing broady towels from two guys.  A 60-pack.  A 60-pack.  That's a lot of towels.  Yeah, she was trying to put them under her shirt.  Like, boosoms.  Boosoms.  By the way, Kevin from Connecticut writes,  Mommy, get out so I can get wet.  He's getting no water.  I could not believe it.  I'm like, what are you talking?  Where did you learn that?  Like, it's just the craziest thing, the things that come out of that kid's mouth. 
[01:38:30]  Mommy butt.  Mommy butt.  Mommy's butt.  Mommy's butt.  That's Howie.  Why did you say mommy's butt is big?  Mommy butt.  Mommy butt.  It's like, whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  It's a big butt.  Yeah, Howie and I were discussing my butt afterwards.  Shonda texted me, and she told me about it.  She was traumatized, and she said,  Howie, you just told me, and my reply was,  Well.  See, I stick up for you and your looks, and you agree with my two-year-old. 
[01:39:00]  Mommy.  It's Howie.  Hi, Howie.  Howie's calling.  Why is your butt so big?  Oh, no.  Howie.  You made it that way, son.  But when you stand in front of me, I can't see around it.  Her kid's got progeria.  Yes, you can.  Don't lie.  You're making mommy feel bad.  Billy at school.  Oh, no.  Here's a Billy at school story, Shonda.  You hate that stupid Billy.  It sucks.  He agreed that you had a big butt, too.  And then his mom came to pick him up.  And she doesn't have a big butt.  She has a big boob, so. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, because she had a breast augmentation.  That's why.  They don't move.  Oh, well.  Breast augmentation, Howie.  Why is that?  Do we have to keep doing this?  This is God awful.  End of story.  Awful.  End of story.  What are they doing?  That's Howie, her two-year-old son, calling.  That's God awful.  Ah, what the Christ.  So he's talking to a fake Howie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For what purpose?  Well, because they just did the Howie and the shower stories.  But that was good enough.  That was a good little fucking this is my life type of shit. 
[01:40:00]  It wasn't good.  It was horrid.  I said good enough.  Incestuous.  I wasn't expecting cold.  It was terrible.  If they would have just, if she would have just done this with her pen, just click her  pen.  That would have had the same entertainment value.  The same reaction?  It's her fucking god awful story.  It's breast augmentation.  What's a breast augmentation?  Shauna, this is all yours.  Well, it's where you, um...  No, incorrect.  It's something you don't need to know about right now.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Maybe we shouldn't discuss it right now.  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't.  Are you going to get one of those?  No, sorry.  I overheard daddy talking to the phone to someone said, and he said he wished he would.  Oh, no.  Oh, great.  Get at us, tag us, and follow us on Twitter.  Find out how at hot96.com.  More Adam and Shonda coming up next on Hot 96.  Stop.  That's invisible.  Well, that's a consultant, too.  You got to...  Oh, my.  And I'm going to laugh.  Going to break, you got to hit him with something like what you think is strong. 
[01:41:00]  A punchline or something like wow.  And big.  Like a wow, big thing.  They got to...  Wow, I got to stay tuned if that's what I'm left with.  Oh, this is horrible.  Yeah, I don't even know what to do with that one.  It's just fucking terrible.  That was so douchey.  Well, the last clip for today's Jocktober.  Atom does an auto-tuned song about the food he wants to eat at the Fall Festival.  The Fall Festival is a big event in Evansville.  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Hey.  Or they put a blue ribbon on his fucking co-host.  Disgusting mess.  Like a pig.  Or a pig, sure.  Before we play the track, Sam writes, it's very long.  It is.  No one's going to listen to this if you tell them it's very long.  Well, I mean, it is long.  I don't know if we're...  So I thought, you know, I'm going to go over the Munchie Map and come up with some of the things I want to try this year.  But I'm going to sing it in auto-tune like T-Pain. 
[01:42:00]  We're on this T-Pain kick.  Why?  Why not?  So once again, you can get the Munchie Map, by the way.  Hot96.com.  It's some really good stuff this year.  And now here it is in auto-tune.  A little T-Pain-inspired fall fest.  I'm just filling out.  Turkey testicles.  Apple dumplings.  Apple fritters. 
[01:42:30]  Give me some more now.  Banana cupcakes.  Banana bread.  I eat it all.  Soon I'll be dead from the fried grease.  Cholesterol.  Barbecue nachos.  I want it all.  I want it all.  Caramel apples.  Sammy just removed his headphones.  Caramel puffs.  Catfish nuggets.  They eat all the stuff.  Cheese balls.  Cheese soup.  Cheese sticks.  He puts the pain in T-Pain.  Cheese cake on a stick. 
[01:43:00]  It makes me sick.  What the fuck is that shit?  We're not supposed to be getting angry, Sam.  It's the foods you can get at the fall fest.  Can we stop right here?  Yeah, this is making me mad.  I'm not having fun with this Jocktober.  It's not fun anymore, Sam.  This is angering me.  You guys always forget Jocktober.  How it always starts fun.  And you guys always are so upset at everything.  And by the end of the month, you don't want to work in the business anymore.  Every year. 
[01:43:30]  I forgot about that.  Fried candy bars.  Fried cookie dough.  Is it fried?  I want to know.  Yeah, I want to know.  Fried Oreos.  Fried Snickers bar.  I'm gonna puke in my car.  Polish sausage.  Monte Cristo.  Anything pumpkin.  I'm good to go.  Give me a tater twister.  They can't even auto-tune correctly.  He's using the T-Pain app on iPhone. 
[01:44:00]  Is that what it is?  Yeah, and he has no clue how to use it.  Tornado taters.  Triple chocolate delight.  Fried alligator.  A walking taco.  Wedgie on a stick.  Why is he laughing so much at that?  I'm eating it all.  Some of the food you can get.  Until I get sick.  That's good stuff.  Give it to me now.  24 seconds.  I want it all.  What?  It's the best time of year.  20 seconds.  It's fall now.  What?  Is this over? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, it's over.  Somebody just texted.  Who sings this song?  Adam sings this song.  Because great minds need a break every now and then.  Oh, and the sick ones too.  Adam and Shonda will be right back.  A threat.  Yeah.  Their fucking bumpers are threats.  No wonder every radio show is being told to shut the fuck up.  Yeah, just play the songs.  They're doing nothing.  Wow.  They play music too, by the way.  This is what they're...  Oh, really? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, that's how little they have going on.  They have songs and this is what they have...  Unbelievable.  I can't get past that one.  I'm going to assess the situation.  This Atom, Scasher, wants to be doing something else in radio.  He was forced to fucking team up with Shonda.  He's not very...  That's what radio thinks is the way to go.  Yeah.  He's not very funny, unfortunately.  Yeah, but you can hear that...  Well, no, he's not.  You can hear he could be doing some maybe some fucking afternoon drive, a little edgy shit  in between some rock songs.  Like Scorch? 
[01:45:30]  I don't know.  Oh, like Scorch.  Yeah, exactly like Scorch.  Maybe without Herb.  I don't even want to kill him because it sounds like he's just isn't into this particular  gig.  Without Herb, like fucking just trotting into him like that.  And she's a typical Hole.  She's no worse than the rest of them out there.  She is exactly what a Hole is supposed to be.  She's exactly like the rest of them.  And he did that whole autotune song by himself, so that was pretty good.  Oh, boy.  Great stuff right there.  Well, maybe you should have done the autotune song.  Yeah, I think so. 
[01:46:00]  Where are we going tomorrow with this Jacktober?  I don't know.  Again, we could still head back home to New York.  Are we ready for New York?  Are you ready for New York?  Oh, I'm ready for New York.  Because New York generally, you guys get very upset because that's the number one market,  so you're expecting certain things.  We got to do a few New Yorks this year.  Oh, I know.  Scott and Todd, because at this point, Scott could barely talk.  Yeah, Scott and Todd will be visited for the third year in a row.  All right, great.  Good, thank God.  Three years running.  I think there's one. 
[01:46:30]  There's at least one other show that will absolutely get visited for the third year in a row.  Okay.  You want to know what it is, or should I surprise you later?  I like when it's a surprise.  Oh, yeah, please.  Oh, then I can think of another one that I think I'm going to visit for the third year in a row.  Do we have that Hole Montage?  Did the librarian find that or no?  I have the produced piece that we made, but I don't have that dry track that I think you're talking about.  All right, you know what?  Play that as the out for Jocktober today.  As we go to break. 
[01:47:00]  We have to make sure Iraq has checked the LARD catalog.  Up next, Jim Brewer, who wrote a fine, fine book, and we'll talk about him and his book next.  Is he here?  He's right outside that door, ready to go, man.  So stay there.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show, on a fire in Sirius XM.  One of our favorites in studio, Jim Brewer, everyone. 
[01:47:30]  He's got a new book out called I'm Not High.  But I've got a lot of crazy stories about life as a goat boy, a dad, and a spiritual warrior.  That's a long fucking title, Jim.  Dude, the name was really hard to maneuver.  I like the part, I'm not high.  I like that.  I'm not high.  And originally, I was going to say I'm not high, but I just look that way.  And then the manager, I mean, everyone, they wanted to push the family thing. 
[01:48:00]  So we all agreed on this.  It's in bookstores today, right?  Yeah.  It's weird.  Nice.  That's so cool.  Right.  It's weird.  We've been very close many times to writing a book.  Why don't you guys write a book?  I don't understand why you write a book.  Because there's stories that will burn bridges.  What bridges?  How could you burn more bridges?  Well, exactly.  There's only a couple left. 
[01:48:30]  Your nickname is the flamethrower kid.  I know.  We would burn the last two bridges we could cross is what I'm getting at.  Who are you burning?  Don't worry about it.  Light the fire.  Throw the gasoline.  I think I just about had it.  Who was fucking skinny, by the way?  How much weight did you lose?  Well, now I got to lose more.  But I lost like 10, 15.  Well, since I saw you, let's see.  That was Pizza Man Story Days.  Pizza Man.  That wasn't that long ago.  Maybe 12, 15 since then.  You look very healthy.  Why do you feel? 
[01:49:00]  You're a chubby little boy.  I was 82 pounds in kindergarten.  Oh my God.  I'm looking at that picture.  Look at how retarded I am right there.  How fucking funny is that?  How do you get to 82 pounds in kindergarten?  Because you're not meant to be fat.  Did kids just punch you in kindergarten?  No.  There was only one of the kids.  Bigger.  Fat kids rule in school.  You can't.  You hit us.  Once we get you to the ground, it's over.  It'll lay on you and squash you.  Fat kids that want to fight, you're fucked.  I was a fat kid that wanted to fight.  Goofy fat kids, though, are so abused. 
[01:49:30]  Cry.  Yeah, yeah.  You would just pinch their fat.  Once you're fat and crying, you're done.  Snot.  In real life.  Snot on her face.  Snot bubbles.  Out the one nostril.  Weep.  Weep.  Weep.  Weep.  Weep.  Weep.  Weep.  Weep.  What?  That's funny.  And they got bad haircuts.  A little fat kid.  But you fought back then.  Okay.  No, I was...  Because on my street, I was the king of the block. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  So when I went to school, I kind of had the same mentality.  And so, yeah, I didn't play around.  I played the wacko.  Yeah.  You know, if they start a fight, like, you are fucking...  I start kicking the wall.  I'm Godzilla.  I'm Godzilla.  I'm King Kong.  I got electricity.  You're like, what a maniac.  But how did...  I love this.  How did you get to 82 pounds in kindergarten?  Because no one in your family is fat.  You're not supposed to be fat, obviously.  I had a... 
[01:50:30]  I had a...  A babysitter who was Italian.  So my mom would drop me off at 7 in the morning.  And then pick me up at 4.  And she...  I swear to God...  I thought it was Pavarotti.  Yeah, I swear to God, I think I ate...  She's too fat.  I think I ate hamburgers and french fries every single day.  And as soon as I came back from school, she'd give me ice cream to shut me up.  Because I was a hyper.  Wow.  So it...  And then I'd watch Freddie Prinze. 
[01:51:00]  What was that show?  Chico and the Man.  Chico and the Man.  I used to watch Make Me Laugh.  Make Me Laugh with Howie Mandel.  That's right.  That was during the day.  Bobby Van was the host of Make Me Laugh.  I wound up getting a brain tumor and dying.  Oh, and Hawaii Five...  Wait, no, not Hawaii.  Who's the Hawaiian guy who had a show?  Don Ho?  Don Ho had a show.  Right?  Remember?  Yeah, I remember Don Ho.  Something like that.  What's her name?  With a stupid ukulele.  That's right.  So then I go home and my mom, like, eat dinner? 
[01:51:30]  No.  Meanwhile, I already had a meal and ice cream.  So I know if I had another meal, I'd get more ice cream.  Dude, I used to have to go to the nurse's office.  That was embarrassing.  Why?  Because the nurse would come.  I was 82 pounds of kindergarten.  That's crazy.  And I broke 100 in second grade.  That's crazy.  So the only thing going for me was Sally Ann Costello was fatter and Noel Garzon. 
[01:52:00]  So once they started hitting on me, like, well, Noel's 120.  But the nurse would come.  And she's like, James Brewer, Noel Garzon, and Sally Costello come with me.  And we'd come out.  And they were like, what'd you eat today?  Like, nothing.  I had cereal.  I was packing, watching McCulloch and Babe Ruth.  I wasn't fessing up to this nurse pig.  So I guess, how long were you fat till?  I think it was fat until, I want to say, 14 when I discovered girls. 
[01:52:30]  I'm like, this ain't going to happen.  This ain't going to happen.  Yeah, I got myself some roller skates.  We played roller hockey every day.  And they were twins on our street.  When I said twins, I mean twins.  Twins.  Twins right across the street.  And they had a pool.  So the first couple times everyone going in the pool, I realized I was way out of order. 
[01:53:00]  You'd kind of be peeling that shirt off and looking all cool.  Right.  I'd make the big loud noise off the side.  When I kick off the side above ground.  And so I realized, oh man, I got to tighten up here.  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit.  To impress the twins.  That's when it happened.  I got rid of my tits.  No.  Not Jim.  Got rid of your tits and got to grab onto someone else's.  That's right.  Very nice.  That's right.  I read this book in two days.  I loved it.  Damn. 
[01:53:30]  So I don't know where you want to go with this.  Because there's a lot of great stories in there.  I don't care.  Well, I told these guys that you were supposed to be aborted.  Yes.  That's funny.  Which comics love.  They're like, you're supposed to be aborted.  I think you were.  Isn't that mean?  You might be born retarded, which obviously you still are.  What I like about the story, though, I'm sure there's a lot of people that were supposed  to be aborted, but they don't know about it.  Your mom openly talked about it.  She tells me.  She told you and everyone that would listen that you were supposed to be aborted. 
[01:54:00]  I said, this is what I get my mom.  She must have been wasted all the time.  She would go, she would go, I went to the doctor and I said, I have terrible gas.  And he said, you're not pregnant.  And then five months later, I was dancing with your father.  Five months.  How do you not know you're pregnant?  And she said, I felt a kick while I was dancing with your father.  And I went, oh, that's not gath. 
[01:54:30]  And they all said, because of her age, she should abort the baby and get rid of the baby.  And we'll give you something.  We'll get rid of that sucker.  And, um, as my mom said, something told me to have this child, just, just have the child.  And, uh, she probably back then really just wanted to clamp on to my dad, take his, whatever  money had left.  Another obligation.  She obviously was partying and stuff because she didn't know she was pregnant. 
[01:55:00]  Most girls will slow down the party a little bit because they're like, oh shit.  My dad was her fourth mom, uh, her fourth husband.  So.  Oh, okay.  If there is a fourth husband, I didn't even know they were married until like 10.  And I went, where's, where's your wedding pictures?  There's no wedding pictures.  Oh no.  Where's your wedding pictures?  And then, uh, one day they were watching TV and they're like, oh, that's the guy who married  us.  And I, and I walked in and they're like, uh, judge so-and-so of Valley Stream, Long Island 
[01:55:30]  today, uh, wins an award for, you know, most garbage clean up.  And she's like, yeah, he married us.  So I don't, I still this day, I don't know what happened.  What kind of marriage?  I just assume, my dad was a bartender, my, who was, I think, still married, but going  through a divorce.  He was a raging drunk from what I understand.  He, not a mean drunk, but a World War II still in the jungle drunk. 
[01:56:00]  Sure.  Old school, an old school drunk.  Right.  Let's go, let's go out to dinner and while, while the waitress is going, today's special's  inside.  He's hearing,  Are you ready to order, sir?  Oh, the Budweiser.  Oh, shit.  Budweiser.  Budweiser.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  He was still fighting the war in his head, huh? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, God damn.  All his friends, now that I look back, they, um, they, the one guy killed himself, one guy  hung himself, one guy drank himself to death, and they were all World War II guys.  Yeah, wow.  And they got him a job.  Two of the guys had heart attacks.  And they were all like our age.  Wow.  Just our age, coming back from the war and just, that was it, you know.  Just had too much.  They saw too much.  There is no Dr. Katz going, tell, tell me about these images you have in your head.  Yeah.  Do you feel guilty of watching another man's skull bleed to death? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, then it was just like, ah, you did it, you come home, now you live your life with  your young lady.  Like, go bang and start kids.  Forget where you just came from, people.  It's America.  We'll give you a hundred dollars in booze.  Today we're going to have a VFW hall to celebrate these great American heroes.  And they're all fucked up. 
[01:57:30]  Hey, Georgie dragged himself to death when he's an American hero.  Fuck Russia.  Holy shit.  Fuck Nazi Germany.  That's so true.  You know?  You're so right.  You ever go to the VFW hall with your dad?  Did he go to those places?  I used to love going there with my dad when he was alive.  Me too.  And he went to a...  They were so fucking racist. 
[01:58:00]  Holy...  But they didn't know any better.  I mean...  That's all they knew.  Old school racism.  Absolutely.  There was a Polak there, a black guy, a Jew, an Irish, an Italian, and they just beat the  shit out of each other all night long.  How many Tuskegee Airmen do they take to tar a roof?  Nope.  They loved it, though.  Hey, Leon, come here.  I want to touch your burr head.  That ain't funny, Jimbo. 
[01:58:30]  That ain't funny.  Quiet, spooky.  Ah, yes.  Hey, Jewbag, I'm buying a house.  Can you help me out?  And here they come, America's troops leaving the ships, just in Europe, coming back to  the United States to their loved ones, that I'm sure they will beat with their fists if  dinner is late.  Yeah, as soon as their celebration's over.  Here they come.  It's a horror show.  Here they come, here comes the first one, and ow, and he's puking over the side with 
[01:59:00]  a bottle of bourbon in his throat, and his penis is hanging out, an obscure scene, however,  a true hero.  James Smith has just got off the boat, and he's walking by a Japanese restaurant.  He's now killing everyone inside.  There you go.  And a crit, Dave Rod Nation.  Still saying, go get him, boys.  God, Drew is so right.  Just buy a nice little house in the suburbs.  No help.  Just forget about everything you saw. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, listen, all that killing and murdering and all that jazz and all your friends getting  blown to peace, don't worry about it.  Yeah, yeah.  You did a good cause.  Go have a cocktail.  Well, he still has blood on his uniform from his best friend's brain, but he's supposed  to just go to the bakery and go to work.  Hey, read the local newspaper.  Look what's going on in the box office.  Let's hear the latest on Lindsay Lohan.  Welcome back from Iraq.  We really care about your cause there in Afghanistan. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, Tom Cruise has got a new movie coming out.  How about that guy?  And his new car.  God bless America, where we put everything important.  Right up in front of the news.  You have no legs, but Elliot Spencer's got a new show.  Hey, while you come back on watching your friend's corpse.  Hey, don't forget when the Chats are holding out for $60 million to defend a football.  Hey, God bless America. 
[02:00:30]  There's no help.  But we really care.  We care for you and yours.  That's great.  That is just great.  As the great James Hetfield would say, sad but true.  Love that fucking song.  Oh, God.  Damn, man.  Yeah.  That's reality right there.  That's heavy reality.  Brewer, fat kid, was supposed to be aborted.  Yeah.  Mom has no problem telling people that. 
[02:01:00]  It's pretty cool.  You know.  It's a great book, Jim.  It really is a great book.  I think Young Comics will like it.  I think, you know, I don't know.  I don't know what to expect.  I wanted more dad stories, but that sounds like you're setting up for maybe a second book  or something.  Well, like him crapping himself?  Oh, shit.  Dude, that's a nightmare.  Wait, you don't want to deal with that.  He's still crapping?  Listen to this one.  I went to, like, 14 days.  I'm in Iowa.  I'm in Dubuque, Iowa.  We roll up to this gorgeous hotel.  Gorgeous hotel.  Why are you down there? 
[02:01:30]  Playing.  I'm performing there.  For 14 days?  Well, it was like Des Moines, Chicago, you know, all these different things.  Gotcha.  So a Midwest tour.  Yeah.  Very exciting.  So I come.  We're at Dubuque, and there's a casino there.  Beautiful hotel.  We get out.  But as I'm getting out, I'm checking in, and now he's already crapped himself twice.  I've already had two incidents where I'm dry heaving my balls off.  You're just taking him on the road with you to hang out?  Yeah, because otherwise he just stares at a wall waiting to die. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, fuck.  That's really what it comes down to.  It's reality, man.  He's just staring at a wall waiting to die.  You're trying to do the right thing as a son.  Thank you, Yanks.  One of your crap stories is in the book.  The plane one is just terrific.  Yeah, that was a tough one.  This one's funnier and more tragic.  Okay.  This is so recent.  The kid comes up to me.  He's got a camera, and he goes, Brewer, your dad has to go. 
[02:02:30]  He has to go now.  I know I've got about five seconds to get him out in the toilet or it's over.  I go there.  I open the door.  When I open the door, there's shit on my fingers.  Oh, fuck.  Right.  I'm like, what the?  What is this?  I'm looking at his hands.  I can't understand where it came from.  It's not on his hands.  It's fresh.  I can't tell where it's coming from.  Oh, God.  So I pull him up, and as I pull him up, I put him in the wheelchair, and I'm looking. 
[02:03:00]  I don't see nothing.  So I roll him in.  It's a beautiful hotel.  I mean, it's businessmen are all having their meeting, and they're drinking wine.  It's like hot cocktail hours I get in.  And as I'm checking, I can smell.  I can smell it.  So I'm like, oh, man.  I see people looking around.  I look at him.  He's got shorts on.  And I don't know how I missed it.  There's clumps of dung just hanging at his shorts. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Are we supposed to laugh?  You have to.  It's so bad.  How can you not?  So I roll him to the corner of the room where no one could see him.  I'm like, Dad, you don't feel it.  It's like a dog when they're 15.  It's just tragic.  So I'm scooping out his poop with paper towels.  I'm dumping the garbage.  I finally get up upstairs, and I'm showering.  But when I went downstairs where I took him out of the car, there's a pile that must have 
[02:04:00]  fell out of his shorts, and it's on the sidewalk.  So there's shit.  And one of the most, it's such a surreal moment in life to see where we go in life.  There's a billion flies all over this thing, and people are just staring at me going, I  can't believe someone will let their dog just defecate on the sidewalk.  And I'm like, man, it's my dad.  It's my dad's not dog's crap.  It's my dad's crap.  Yeah, it's fun stuff, man. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, man.  Try to heat your ass up.  I mean, like, hard.  Do you smell your fingers for the rest of the night like if something's bad on it?  You can't help it.  Yeah, you get bars of soap, and you're digging your nails in it.  You're just clawing at the soap to get it under your fingernails.  It follows you everywhere.  Don't think you can leave us.  Now, the obvious.  Why doesn't he wear adult diapers?  He does.  But just like kids, as you will learn about yours, Ope, kids sometimes have ones that  just, the diaper can't hold it.  It explodes right through. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yeah, we got that going on already.  So I starved him the last three days.  It's because you didn't want to do it.  When you're going on a plane, I starved him to death.  There was no, you know, screwed up.  Starved him.  What are you going to do?  I can't have him crapping all over.  You had him do it on a plane one time?  I don't know the story.  Oh, Jimbo.  You had to go into the bathroom?  Oh, no, no, no.  We're on one of those little puddle hoppers.  Oh.  We make it all the way back to Newark.  We're taxiing to the gate.  We're about five feet from the gate, and he turns to me, and he goes, I got a shit. 
[02:05:30]  I said, Dad, we can't stop on the taxiway.  He's like, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Are you sure you're fine?  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Are you sure?  Yeah, I'm good.  All of a sudden, I smell it.  And we go, oh, no.  I said, did you?  He goes, no, no.  I can tell the way he's sitting.  Yeah.  A little sideways.  Yeah.  He's got the one cheek up.  I went, he dropped it. 
[02:06:00]  He dropped it.  Thank God.  I'm not even exaggerating.  There was like a two-year-old kid behind me crying.  So I'm starting to get the rest of the cabin to start staring at the kid like, someone needs  to be changed.  So when we get off, I don't realize it's there until as I'm walking him up, because it's so  small.  I'm backing up.  And then when I backed him out to get in his wheelchair, you just see in the back, it  was bad.  So I brought him into a continental president club. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  I roll him in there.  Like, he can't have a club card.  I don't have a club card.  I got an emergency.  I need to have the public.  I'm not using the public.  I'm using the private.  Oh, okay.  Go in there.  I mean, I get him in there.  It looked like someone took algae and just threw it all over his legs, his pants, was  on the chair.  And as I'm trying to clean it, I'm literally like, and he's going, I'm sorry. 
[02:07:00]  I didn't mean it.  Like, I know you didn't mean it.  Oh, God.  The worst is when other people come in.  Oh, my God.  People coming in.  And now they're coming in for the show.  They don't know.  Like, what's going on in the bathroom?  Like, I don't know.  Some guy in a stall.  No.  And the smell is horrifying.  Now, do you carry, because you know he might do that.  Yes.  Do you carry extra pants or something?  Yes.  Okay.  I carry pants, diaper, shirt.  Because when he craps, it goes up his back. 
[02:07:30]  It goes down his pants.  Just like a baby.  Yeah.  And the worst is when he crapses himself and he gets on the toilet, it's all on his legs.  So when he gets up from the toilet, I forget.  Ah, he's not going to wipe your leg.  Oh, there it's.  Oh, wow.  So is it just age or was he sick?  It's age.  Just age.  Okay.  It's age.  It's like a dog when they just sit there and they're shaking and it just squirts out their  ass.  How old is Pops now?  87.  Jeez.  Fuck, man.  God bless him.  How do you have an 87?  He was old when he had you.  You're a younger guy for an age.  45, I think he had me.  And, you know, I keep asking. 
[02:08:00]  I'm like, you know, you want me pillow?  Pillow.  You won't even feel it.  Sleeping.  Middle of the night.  Did you ever?  Just let me know.  Let me know.  I'll totally do it.  Don't worry about it.  Is he coherent at all?  Like you guys talk?  He's very coherent, but now he won't.  It's weird, man.  You see your dad.  He won't.  He don't.  He does absolutely nothing.  He won't read a paper.  He won't watch television.  He just sits waiting to die.  Wow.  So the only time he's coherent is when I show up. 
[02:08:30]  Wow.  When I show up, that's it.  Is he living with you now?  Oh, like once a week.  Yeah, that was.  I'll come in for the weekends and stuff.  Yeah.  And my mom wanted him back.  Like, I want my, bring him back here.  Which is, you know, she just barrages him.  You know, as he craps, which he feels horrible for.  She's like, you're disgusting.  You can't see this coming for Christ's sake.  I'm not cleaning shit or I'm going to poison you. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  So she's no help.  How old is she?  She's 85 and she's blind in an eye.  And she's got a big, crazy tumor on her hip that she won't get rid of.  It's the size of a golf ball.  She has cancer on her face, which she keeps saying, the pimple.  I'm like, Ma, you got cancer on your face.  No, I'm not going to the death.  Then let it take apart my face.  It's horrifying, bro.  It's horrifying.  Wow.  Yeah.  She's got this big red spot on her face with a black tip. 
[02:09:30]  I'm like, it's cancer.  No, it's not.  I've had it checked out.  Oh, God.  Who checked it out?  One of her friends.  Right.  It's like they reach a point.  And I think every parent says it at some point to their kid.  They go, oh, if I ever get to that point, you fucking take me out.  Yeah.  And then they get to that point and you go like, am I supposed to take him out?  She said it.  Am I supposed to?  Right.  I guess, you know, in the old days, they'd jump off a cliff or something.  I don't know what they. 
[02:10:00]  I'm going to go feed myself to the lions.  Yeah, they just walked themselves into the woods to die.  Right.  Carve Brooks was here on a beam and just fucking.  My dad, it's, you know, I used to listen to Sam Kinison and he would go, you know, when  I'm at the age, when I'm at the toilet and I'm just, it's just dripping out.  Just kill me.  Kill me.  And I hear that over my dad, whenever he wears, like his piss, it just trickles out.  It just, it trickles out and it goes, it doesn't go in the toilet, it goes all over his pants. 
[02:10:30]  And I go, dad, you don't see the peel?  He's like, I don't get it.  What am I going on a fashion show?  What am I going on a fashion show?  And he's got piss all over his pants.  Fashion show.  It's so sad.  What an old school guy though.  But I will say, I brought him on the, I bring him to Iowa.  You're going to freaking, Jimmy and you would, all of you would love him in public because 
[02:11:00]  he's beyond shocking and he knows exactly what he's doing.  He does.  We go into this Italian restaurant and this waiter, he tests every waiter that comes up.  And he comes up, hi, today's special, are you a fag?  No, sir.  No, sir.  But, you know, I have nothing against him.  All right, Chris Graham.  Now the guy comes up and he goes, you know, you know, man, you look like a badass.  You used to be in the military.  Now he's, now these guys are getting dirtier and dirtier. 
[02:11:30]  He comes over, you know, you know what a specials is?  And he goes, yeah, it's my weenie.  And you got to look around and make sure no one's heard him.  And now the kid's playing with him.  He comes back and the kid's like, you know, I just checked with the whole staff and apparently  your weenie's not that special.  So now he's got a friend.  The worst though, he says is so freaking, the manager comes over.  Because now they know who I am and all this jazz. 
[02:12:00]  Manager comes over and he brings a dessert tray with some other lady.  And he goes, he goes, is any of these, you know, these are our desserts really.  He goes, any of them taste like parsley?  And I'm like, dad, dad.  And the waiter's like, oh, absolutely.  Go for the cream belay.  That's like my father.  So he still has his wits, but unless you're shocking and dirty humor, he wants nothing.  He doesn't want to do it.  He wants nothing to do it. 
[02:12:30]  He wants to go shocking and dirty.  He wants to go filthy.  You know, every trip is, are we getting laid?  Dad, what are you going to do?  I still got a tongue.  Dad.  So he has that, he has that wit about him.  Yeah, he's still a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you ask him what year it is.  It's 1986.  Oh, really?  You're good enough, close enough.  That's it, yeah.  I had to get him out of the hospital that way.  He, they kept asking him.  This is what he said.  They say, they say, Mr. Brewer, how are you feeling? 
[02:13:00]  Terrible.  What's the matter?  I'm pregnant.  Is he, is he crazy?  He's always like that.  What year is it?  Who gives a shit?  Who's the president?  Who gives a shit?  All right, we got to keep him in here.  I'm like, no, he's fine.  No, that's him.  That's him.  That's exactly how he's supposed to be.  I'm signing him out.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it is what it is.  You laugh at it or, you know.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  You sit there and go, oh, this is the worst.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, other people can just fucking sit there, though. 
[02:13:30]  It's hilarious.  It ruins their life, too.  It's funny.  Are you embarrassed or do you just embrace it?  Because I get so embarrassed about nonsense.  I shouldn't.  I used to.  You used to get embarrassed and. . .  I get embarrassed when he says certain things to. . .  I don't mind for the guys, but it's in front of women.  Yeah.  You know, like. . .  Well, I get embarrassed when he shits himself.  Yeah, it's mortifying.  It's mortifying.  I've got to figure out.  To be in public, it's just mortifying to have an old man. . .  Because he's that guy.  Don't you picture yourself. . . 
[02:14:00]  You see an old man again in their pants and soil.  You're going, ew, put him. . .  Ew.  Put him away.  Oh, fuck.  Take him out.  I'm like, no, it's my dad.  So, yeah, sometimes it's a little. . .  You carry, like, wet naps and stuff?  I bring a hose, Jimmy.  Wet naps don't do the job.  You've got to be the greatest son of all time.  Yeah, I'm a bad son.  I don't know if I can handle that.  To that extent.  I've done some shit.  If you see that look. . .  Well, you won't. . .  Yeah, my dad's gone now.  If you see that look in a relative or a close friend. . . 
[02:14:30]  Just that look of, man, I'm so sorry.  You just. . .  You go, all right, let me. . .  Let me go back to Swilkin Pot and get some music.  And we'll get through this thing here.  I haven't joined the club where you wipe your own parents' ass.  It's not fun, bro.  I've got a few in my family that have, though.  I just have not crossed that barrier yet.  We make it an event.  I just can't fucking do it.  We make it an event.  We really do. 
[02:15:00]  We turn on Johnny Cash.  We turn on Hank Williams.  And he gets all hopped up.  And we just talk about everything else.  While I'm rubbing. . .  While I'm scraping his ass.  Unbelievable.  And he's mortified.  He's like, yeah, when's our next road trip?  Oh, not so hard.  God damn it.  Oh, shit.  Can't you just throw him in a shower at that point?  Sometimes you don't want to throw him in a shower because it's a big production.  Okay.  And he fights it like a lion. 
[02:15:30]  I just showered yesterday.  I don't need a shower.  I just need a shave.  Jimmy, would you wipe your own parents' ass?  I guess if you have to. . .  That's a tough call, man.  I'm telling you right now.  Yeah, I mean. . .  Thank God I have a lot of brothers and sisters.  Right now, I just think I would pull out a list of things that I had wanted to discuss as a child that didn't get talked about first.  I guess you have to. . .  Does having kids make it easier, though?  Because you've done that with your daughters? 
[02:16:00]  It's totally different?  No, that's a different beast, man.  The stench alone is a completely different beast.  Kids are no problem.  They don't really smell.  It's little, and it's your own.  Totally different beast.  It's like people wiping their own dog or something.  It's yours when it's an adult and, I mean, the stench.  To look at another man that way or a woman.  It's just. . .  Yeah.  You're looking at their junk. 
[02:16:30]  I'm looking at his junk like, well, my donkey don't look like that.  I'm looking at, is that what I'm going to look like?  It's just a different beast.  Different beast.  Better man than I.  There's no fucking way.  I would fucking hire someone to follow me around and do that.  See, now. . .  There's no way I could do that.  That's what I want to do.  I want to say. . .  Now that I'm watching this, I would save money so someone could do that for me.  And I want it to be an event.  So you could still travel around. 
[02:17:00]  You could do everything.  But during the shit part, it's like, now you're on.  With the bell.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  There it is.  There it is.  You're on call.  Let's go.  This is why you get money.  And then you just stand there, talk to them.  And someone else could be digging in.  Turn on my. . .  Turn on my. . .  Wouldn't you like your Judas Priest, Mr. Brewer?  Turn on the devil's child.  Phones are lit.  They're all in the club.  Guys all over the place in the club.  We're all that age.  It's something no one talks about. 
[02:17:30]  No, but it's real life, man.  Not in the club yet.  I think we're getting close, though.  It's real life.  I think it's going to be my turn.  Jimmy, let me ask something.  When your books came out, you went and did signings.  I did, yes.  How would. . .  Because I do signings tomorrow.  We should promote it.  Tomorrow. . .  I don't. . .  Well, let's promote it.  12.30 tomorrow.  Borders on Wall Street.  100 Broadway in Manhattan.  Did you do that one?  I did not do that one.  No, I did. . .  I did the one at MSG.  But it was later.  I didn't do any noon signings. 
[02:18:00]  You're famous enough to do them.  I wasn't.  Oh.  I don't buy that.  No, no.  Honestly.  That's a tougher one to do.  But Jim's a more recognizable guy.  It's true.  So he's tomorrow.  12.30 Borders on Wall Street.  And also 7 p.m.  Barnes & Noble in Lake Grove, Long Island.  That's great.  You're getting two of them done tomorrow.  Both major bookstores.  But when you would do it, what, like, is it weird?  It's great.  It's cool.  I love it.  You never sat down and signed stuff?  I have.  I love it, actually.  I will say. 
[02:18:30]  You connect with everybody that, you know, is a fan of you.  The book world I'm noticing is a lot different.  Yeah.  It's a completely different audience.  And it's not like the stand-up crew.  And you don't have to be hilarious.  I know.  You just got to fucking sit there and sign.  I did, um, they invited me, the book company invited me to the National, like, freaking  Library Association.  People go to this, like, oh, it's huge. 
[02:19:00]  You got to go.  It's like thousands of people in D.C.  I'm like, well, what do you, you're a guest speaker.  I'm like, all right, well, what do I get, you got to do a half hour and, you know, read  from your book.  I'm like, I'm not reading from my book.  So I'm following a guy, and people are sitting down listening to him.  And he was, I won't say dreadful, but I'm like, oh, no.  It was a chapter two.  It was a cold, windy day and under the oak tree.  And so I went, I'm going to crush this place. 
[02:19:30]  So I went up, and I just talked, and within 20 minutes, it was a crowd, and I went, uh,  and they said, you're done.  I'm like, done.  Just getting started.  Just getting started.  What are you talking about?  I'm like, this is the book world?  Sign me.  I'm in.  Bye-bye comedy clubs.  I'm going on a storytelling tour.  So I'm intrigued, and I just don't know what to expect.  You'll pull up to the bookstore.  You'll start to worry how many people are there. 
[02:20:00]  How long is the line?  I'm already worried.  When you get there, you'll start to look at where does the line start.  Right.  Is that good?  Like, where's the table?  Is that a good place for the line to start?  How far is the table?  How long is this going to take?  If it's quick, I'm going to look stupid.  Right.  We've got to give them the best pointer, because it happens to everybody.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're going to have one of these book signings where it's sort of a bust, so you're going  to find yourself talking to people a little longer.  A little more than you said.  To make sure the line never ends.  Get back here.  I do that with my DVDs.  Okay, so you know.  At the end of the show, I'm like, yeah, so, yeah, it started 1989, and DVDs over here. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, we really got to go, Jim, but it was great seeing you.  When we were in Boston, we had a CD out that did really well in general, but we did a signing  in downtown Boston that was a major fucking flop, and we ended up talking to every person  that came off for easily five minutes, to the point where they're like, look, man, I'm  a fan, but I got things to do.  You guys are needy.  Right.  Well, we didn't want the line to end, because then you're just sitting there with a fucking 
[02:21:00]  Sharpie in your hand, looking like a dork.  Waiting for someone to come in.  I went to the book signing.  It was really sad.  Yes, we've had that.  It was great.  We sat with him, we took pictures, and there was nobody else there.  Remember that, Ian?  And then you had people going, they got back on the line and said, well, there's, and they  had to tell you, well, there's no one here, so I might as well come back and get something  else signed from you guys.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They come back around, you see the same person with a sticker.  Could you sign this?  But then you get the ones that are just, you feel like a fucking rock star. 
[02:21:30]  You're going to have a few of those.  Dude, you'll be great.  He'll be fucking phenomenal, because if you interact with people, which you're great at,  you'll take photos, because you're fan-friendly, and you could talk before, some bookstores  have a little podium, like Barnes & Noble did, Borders did not.  You're only going to have time to say hi, sign their book.  Some of them I will.  And take a quick picture.  That's it, because they're going to have to move them through a little bit.  They move those lines.  It's worth it, though, man.  Book signings are great.  It moves a lot of books.  You'll do an independent store.  They've probably got you in, maybe Huntington, in some place. 
[02:22:00]  I'm surprised you're not in, uh...  I'm surprised he's not going to Huntington.  Book signings in Jersey.  Or Huntington.  I am going to Jersey.  I'm going to, um...  Tom's River.  Oh, Ocean's County Library.  Oh, that's Thursday.  7 p.m.  Ocean County Library in Tom's River, New Jersey.  Dude, I was reading the book in between, like, while we were talking before.  Honestly, it's fucking great.  Damn.  It really is good.  Because I remember the whole Chappelle, Buddy's fiasco, and I'm reading it, like, from Jim's  point of view, and it's unbelievably good. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, why don't we do this?  Take a break, and we'll continue talking.  We're talking about Jim Brewer's book, I'm Not High, because we've got to talk about  the SNL shit, which is amazing in there.  And something I want to get into is the spirituality of you.  I've known you forever.  I didn't know how deep you go with this God thing.  I know.  So we'll talk about that a little bit as well.  No, I know, I know.  You've got a good take on it, though.  Yeah.  All right.  So more with Jim Brewer.  Stay there.  And now, this is the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  This is my first Metallica song. 
[02:23:00]  This was the one?  This was the one that brought me in.  This is the first one my friend Phil said, listen to this.  And you're like, oh, this is good shit.  Yeah, and that's what happened. 
[02:23:30]  Now, you're a hardcore Metallica fan.  Yeah.  Where are you at with the Black Album?  Because a lot of hardcore fans like...  Black Album?  As in Sad But True?  All that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Unforgiven and Wherever I May Roam.  I love...  I think Sad But True is one of the greatest songs ever put out.  Ever, right?  Yeah.  Wherever I May Roam is right behind that, too.  Wherever I May Roam is one of the best lyrics for...  I love where I'll redefine anywhere.  Some people are just like, oh, the Black Album, that's when they sold out, man! 
[02:24:00]  Sold out, man!  Well, that's a great album.  It's a great album.  It's an amazing album.  I love the last song, Struggle Within, which got no airplay.  That's one of my favorite songs.  Struggle Within!  Oh, yeah.  Struggle!  I love that song.  I love the new album.  This is great.  We're going to go in there. 
[02:24:30]  We're going to take no shit!  You want to play rough?  We'll show them rough.  There's this shit that's got to be blaring from helicopters.  Right, you're in top.  The fucking missiles are just flying.  You got your flag and you're on a horse.  Boys, this is when freedom reigns.  To the enemy!  Take your shirts off!  Now you're running across the fields.  Turn this part up. 
[02:25:00]  Here they go.  Go!  Now the battle begins.  They just beat the shit out of them blindsided.  I don't know what happened to you.  Oh my god, you're taking over!  Giant armies colliding in the middle of the field.  The big Lord of the Rings scene.  Release the prisoners!  That was the best scene ever. 
[02:25:30]  Release the prisoners!  And he starts tossing their heads.  Yeah, that guy's fucked up.  That guy's fucked on now.  His eyes all droopy.  Release the prisoners!  Fucking Metallica.  Oh.  Nice.  Yeah.  So, yeah, no.  What are those guys up to?  You know what I love?  They're torn.  Torn, torn, torn.  They're all in Europe and there and this and that.  I like, um... 
[02:26:00]  You got a large story in the book.  You never heard that story?  That one I didn't hear before, no.  You never heard the knapsack story?  Nope.  The knapsack.  Are you kidding me?  You want to tell it on the show?  It's up to you.  This is...  This is hilarious.  Look, Lars...  First of all, I...  Lars is the most intense...  Like, you want to define a rock star?  It's Lars.  Lars has got...  He's just...  His intent...  You see where the intensity comes from? 
[02:26:30]  He's got that intensity.  Dude, I'm ready to take over the world right now.  I've had these conversations where he's like...  Where it would just be me and him.  He's like, me and fucking you right now.  We'll take over...  Let's fucking do it.  We'll start the revolution right here.  Right here.  And he gets me hopped up.  He gets me hopped up.  This was years ago.  You know what?  My wife was pregnant.  All right?  So...  You can understand it.  Oh, she's pregnant. 
[02:27:00]  And I'm going through the whole little fluffy babies on the way stage.  And Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98?  98?  Something like that.  99, maybe?  And he goes, dude, let's...  What are you doing tonight?  And I said, I'm playing down the village.  Let's fucking hang out.  And I'm going to meet up with some friends.  It's going to be great.  So we go down.  We go to the cellar.  He watches me at the cellar.  We then go downstairs to the bar at the bottom of the comedy cellar. 
[02:27:30]  I'm sorry.  The Boston, you mean?  I mean Boston.  The Boston.  We go up.  I do a spot in Boston.  And then we go to the bar downstairs.  And when we're downstairs...  Now, on the way over, we cabbed it.  And some kid from NYU left his knapsack with all his books and no books.  And I felt awful for that.  All my nieces and nephews are in college.  And I know how much they spend on these books and all that. 
[02:28:00]  So you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is it?  A guy from Saturday Live is going to send him back his books.  He said, well, this is a thorn in Lars' ass.  For the minute I get it.  For the minute I get it, he's like, dude, what are you doing with the fucking nap?  Give rid of the fucking knapsack.  It's ridiculous.  You look like a fag walking around with this fucking knapsack.  So I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy. 
[02:28:30]  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  It'll teach him a lesson.  So we're now downstairs.  Now, you know, I'm like, what a great guy, hero.  I've hung out with him a couple of times.  Well, it's the first time I really partied, partied out in public with him.  And this kid comes up.  He obviously knows who Lars is.  And he's walking.  He's like, dude, can I have a cigarette?  Can I bum a cigarette off you?  That's his approach to the hot chick.  Hey, can I bum a cigarette off you, Mr. Rockstar? 
[02:29:00]  Lars turns around and he goes,  Dude, did it ever fucking occur to you that sometime tonight before your evening started,  you would fucking be engaging in cigarettes?  I work hard for these fucking cigarettes.  And I'm going.  And the kids look at him like, what's your problem, man?  What's your problem?  So I'm like, Lars, it's cool.  He's like, dude, it's not cool.  Don't fucking go buy your own cigarettes.  Whoa. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, Jesus, that's intense.  This is not what I did.  I've never seen that reaction from someone asking for a cigarette.  So, I mean, he must get all the time or whatever.  So I said, let's get out of here.  Let's because now these kids were like eight friends.  And they went from Metallica Rocks to, dude, we'll take you.  We'll take you, you punk.  And then that fag with the knapsack.  We'll take him, too.  So we leave.  We do a shot or whatever.  And we leave out in the street.  He tears the knapsack off my back. 
[02:30:00]  And so what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street.  He hits some chick in the leg and it opens up and the bags go all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh?  Huh?  What's wrong with this?  Are we hanging fucked in the knapsack, huh?  Huh?  So we start heading to our 6th Avenue.  And we go to 6th Avenue.  And there's a busy road on a Saturday night.  And it's, you know, it's like one in the morning, whatever. 
[02:30:30]  And cars, he doesn't wait for the green light.  He starts crossing the street and cars are, they're screeching.  And they pull in front of him.  He starts banging their hood.  What the fuck, huh?  You fucking want to hang out, huh?  Get out of the fucking car, huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  He keeps getting in my face.  He's going, we're hanging a wall.  So now he, like a rock star, he's walking over parked cars.  Like stepping on the trunk, walking over the tops and the hoods. 
[02:31:00]  And then hopping off like this is it.  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  That's a whole other story, yeah.  This is a whole different beast.  I've never seen it.  I can't, so he brings me to this private club.  And this is when it was, we go to this club and it was like, it's on 7th Avenue somewhere.  I don't know what, and you have to go up the stairs. 
[02:31:30]  It's really dark.  And they know who he is, and we get up there, and if a bomb went off in this room, half the music industry would be collapsed.  Really?  Wow.  It was Dave Matthews, one of the Backstreet Boys, the guy who wears the cowboy hat, which Backstreet Boys back then were huge.  Huge.  Huge.  Owls and Chains, a couple of guys from Owls and Chains, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Gwyneth Paltrow.  And there were like two other people that you look at and you go, oh my God, that's, that's like, that's, that guy's like the queen of fucking Wales. 
[02:32:00]  And it was very surreal, very dark, had a, I had a creepy vibe.  And I just remember, um, I went, you know what, man, I'm, I'm going to head home.  Lars's face was like, I just left an orgy.  He's like, what?  I'm fucking leaving. 
[02:32:30]  I said, my wife's pregnant.  What the fuck?  Dude, you can't just fucking leave or fucking hanging out in a fucking knapsack.  And who are you, man?  I said, my wife's pregnant.  It's two in the morning.  I'm like, dude, let the fucking go.  Just, all right, man.  We'll see yourself another time.  What the fuck?  And the next morning he called up, he's like, he went to Ben Affleck's, Matt Damon, which was bizarre because he, he, his first wife used to date, uh, uh, Matt Damon. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, really?  Hence the Skylar in the movie.  And that, and, uh, Good Will Hunting.  You know how Matt Damon's character fell in love with a girl named Skylar.  Right.  Who's, that's her real name.  And so Skylar used to really date Matt Damon.  And then Lars eventually married that Skylar.  And I'm like, you're hanging out with the guy that used to, like, be with your wife, man? 
[02:33:30]  That's fucking weird.  No?  That's a lot.  Fuck that guy.  You won.  Move on.  Did he care or no?  No, no, no.  He's like, they're great guys.  And they are.  It's, you know, hung out and talked to them.  Ben Affleck was a lot bigger than I thought.  So I would never trash talk him because he will kick my ass.  Yeah, really?  Oh, he's a big guy?  I remember that night, he's bigger than I anticipated.  I'm like, I would never say anything about this guy.  Right.  And they're like Boston, Boston.  I wouldn't play that.  They got Boston in their souls. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, and they were very, very cool.  But, yeah, that was my big night hanging out.  And I had other nights with him, but never this.  I was going to ask you if he ever called you again after that experience.  Never really called for years after that.  I was like, fuck that.  Until I played San Francisco and he came, we went to the house and hung out.  You were a pussy.  I was a pussy.  You pussied out.  I pussied out.  You couldn't keep up with him.  I pussied out.  You should have walked down the park car.  You should have fucking booted that knapsack right from this car.  Punched a few cabbies in the face. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, like everything.  Something.  It's so out of control.  He was looking for something from you.  I couldn't go there.  I couldn't go there.  You were friends with him before, Headfield, though, right?  Yes.  Yes.  Definitely.  You're better friends with Headfield, though, right?  Yeah.  He's more of my level.  More of my speed.  Dogs, cats, family.  Yeah.  You know, at the end of the night, he's just sitting down like, I'm going to go play with  the dog.  Yeah, me too.  I'll go stick around.  Play with the dog.  You watch Simpsons? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, I watch Simpsons.  You watch Simpsons?  Yeah, I watch Simpsons.  Right.  Just easy stuff.  Yeah, right.  I'm not going to be walking into clubs at four in the morning.  Dude, what the fuck, huh?  Fucking knapsack.  Doing shots and yelling at people that want cigarettes.  That's awesome.  You introduced me to those guys in 97, because they date every autograph they signed.  They just put their first name and the date.  Lars 97, James 97.  Was it Garden?  SNL.  Oh, wow.  You went Florentine.  Was it Florentine there, too?  Also, they did Fuel and Memory Remains. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  We got to watch them warm up.  They had to time it in between commercials.  Right.  So they did like eight times each song.  Yes.  And Marianne Faithful came.  Yes.  And they fucking, Hetfield hated her.  I remember that.  Well, this is funny, because eventually, we go to Lars' house.  Lars is very, like, as a guy, most phenomenal guy ever.  So we go in his basement, and James comes over, and Lars is like, dude, this fucking huge James  is here.  He never comes to hang out.  So I'm down there, and I start, I go, listen, and I'm comfortable enough. 
[02:36:00]  I guess I've had some cocktails.  So I'm like, dude, what's up with, I had a memory.  Like, who invited that chick?  And Lars' head's in sweat, and James is going, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  The more I would ride it, the harder he would laugh.  And then I realized, like, oh, I guess that was. 
[02:36:30]  That was Lars' idea.  And Lars like, dude, she used to date one of the guys from The Stones.  I'm like, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, very unfaithful.  The Jagger was fucking her.  Yeah, who cares?  Did she fucking, I hate that.  I liked that at the end of Member Remains  I liked it  It stinks  She's lovely  I hated that  She did a lovely version of  As Tears Go By  Please  A lovely lady  I liked that at the end of the song 
[02:37:00]  It was just weird  She just wrecked it  Was Lars kind of  What's the word? Deferential to the Stones?  Yes  He's  He's geniusly tapped into  Music is an art to him  Would he have acted that same crazy way  I think if he's walking around with Charlie Watts?  Would you think he would have been a little mellower?  Maybe  Maybe a little mellower 
[02:37:30]  Maybe  I remember  I don't know if I told you guys  They did this Music Cares Foundation thing  And I guess the music industry too  They have certain people they look up to  And who's  Is it Tom Waits?  The guy  I don't know anything about him  Not to disrespect him  So the big thing for the night  Is Tom Waits is playing  Alright  And it's  Velvet Revolve is there  Owls and Chains  Ozzy's there  All these free  Sandra Bullock's there 
[02:38:00]  With Jesse James  Years ago  Metallica there  Flea  And that whole  Jazz is there  So  I do a thing there  And I'm just like  Wow  There's  Major musical heavyweights in here  But everyone's on eggshells  Because Tom Waits is coming  Right  So  There's an MC there  Greg Bernhardt  Greg Bernhardt  He has a show right  He had one  Greg Bernhardt  I think he was in the building yesterday 
[02:38:30]  Actually  Glasses right  He's hosting  Not to say he did a phenomenal  Because when he was hosting this  I went  Good luck  He was phenomenal  He was phenomenal  So he's hosting this thing  And  Now they go  Ladies and gentlemen  Tom Waits  And  He doesn't come out  And  Tom Waits  Is coming  Now  Supposedly Tom Waits  Had to get a certain piano  And he got the piano  He didn't like the way it looked  So they  Had to ship another piano  And if there's alcohol served 
[02:39:00]  He's not entering the building  Whole big thing  Holy shit  With Tom Waits  I'm an asshole  So everyone's afraid to sit  Now it's been like five awkward minutes  And  And  People are not talking  And  Greg Bernhardt comes out  He's like  I swear he's gonna be out  Who breaks the tension  Ozzy  Ozzy goes  Well  Come on Tom  We ain't  Go to a fucking night  It's not a fucking beetle  Let's go  Can he say that  Yes  He's got a fucking beetle 
[02:39:30]  And he came out  And then sure enough  Tom Waits finally came out  But  Until Ozzy said that  He broke all the tension  It was the funniest  That's great  I think it was one of the most  Memorable things I ever saw  And I belly laughed  So  That's great  Come on Tom  We ain't got to a fucking night now  Jesus Christ  He's a fucking  He's not a fucking beetle  Unbelievable  Brewer's here  His new book is called  I'm Not High  The book is great  He's gonna be doing book signings

[02:46:00]  This wasn't like  In a bar  No this is in a green room  Yeah brewers  Getting ready to go on SNL  And perform  This is a green room  This is the last thing  You want to deal with  Before you go out there  And he says  I said to him  I said listen  I never  Meant to offend you  And again he goes  You never meant to offend me  Then you shouldn't say  These fucking words  And he goes off again  I said  Please just hear me out  I go  If you listen to sketch  I listen to sketch  It's why I'm here  I said  Well 
[02:46:30]  I never call an Italian  A name  I always refer  To the people  On the panel  As like  What do you think  I'm some kind of  And he goes  Don't fucking imitate me  In front of me  I don't like that  So I go  Excuse me  I go  What do you think  I'm some kind of  Whacked out wop  What do you  Are you accusing me  And that's why  As your character  I get mad at the other guy  And I said  You know what

[02:47:30]  Hopped up  But  I swear to god  To this day  I think he was dead serious  Really  Yeah  Because years later  I saw Bruno Kirby  And I'm telling you man  All those guys  Say that  I'm telling you  The way they shake your hand  And everything  Yeah  Yeah  And Bruno Kirby  This is what he said to me  It freaked me out  He goes  So I heard you met Joe  I said yeah 
[02:48:00]  He goes  How did that go  How did that go  Yeah  You know what  You know  He scared me  And he just kind of smiled  And then he asked me  Which is another freaky story  I don't want to get into  Because I'm just scared to death  About it  Holy shit  And he goes  You like doing movies like this  I went  Yeah  He goes  I think you'll be doing  More movies like this  But it was such a  That's a whole different subject  Wow that is weird man  And we'll spend another  Whole freaking day doing this  But I'm afraid I'll get whacked  I don't even want to talk about it 
[02:48:30]  I don't even want to talk about it  But  And then it ended by him going  Which  Jimmy would freaking love  He goes  Now listen  Listen  He started calling me Jimmy  And Jimbo  Which  I instantly was like  Oh god  Thank god this is over  He's going  Jimbo  Here's what we're doing  Here's how it goes down  You tell me how to do the sketch  And then I tell Bobby  Bobby ain't doing no  Dress rehearsal bullshit  He goes  You know  They tell us  We got to hear for  We ain't doing no  Dress rehearsal bullshit 
[02:49:00]  Bobby don't do that  So I tell Bobby  We'll come on  We do it  You don't have a problem  With that right  As soon as they left  I ran to Lorne  I'm like  Lorne  Is that  You're not doing it  And that's when I realized  How powerful Lorne was  Because I said  He's not coming  And Lorne just  Calmly drinking his soda  He's like  He'll be here  I'm like  I'm telling you  He said De Niro  He said  De Niro will be here  For the dress  And  He held out  All the way  Until the sketch started 
[02:49:30]  When the sketch started  I looked over  De Niro was not there  And they said  De Niro's not showing up  Because he just found out  The show was live  That's how cool he was  Back then  Never did TV ever  This is his first TV appearance  Ever  So  He found out  The show was live  I'm not doing it  I'm not doing it  I don't do it live  I don't do it live  I'm not doing it live  Jesus  So they dressed up  Daryl Hammond  As a fake De Niro  To walk out with Pesci  Which was so stupid 
[02:50:00]  So they were going to have  A real Pesci  Fake De Niro  Talking to  Me the fake Pesci  And Colin Quinn  As a fake De Niro  And when the sketch started  I looked over to Daryl  I went  Daryl please tell me  He's here  And he went  I'm sorry  He's not here  And so we started  The sketch  That's a good Daryl  By the way  Is it  Is it really  Yeah  I don't know  I don't get his soul  And I was depressed  And I felt bad  For Rob Lowe  Because I gave him nothing  And I half-assed the sketch 
[02:50:30]  And I went  And that's it  That's a joke  And all of a sudden  I heard  And I turned around  And I saw the famous  Hat  And the look  And De Niro and Pesci  Standing  And I got chills  Just thinking about it  And I just remembered  He was smelt like wine  He reeked of red wine  And he never blurred his lines  Every time it was time  For his lines  It would just be dead air 
[02:51:00]  And Pesci would nudge him  And Pesci would give him a nudge  And then De Niro would go like  De Niro literally looked at Pesci  And he goes  What?  He goes  You fucking  He goes  Oh, oh, whoa  And he points at Colin Quinn  He goes  Who are you supposed to be?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  20 minutes of ovations  And then in between the shows  Lorne sits you down  This is what Lorne says  Jim  You really have to interrupt the ovation  I can't have three minutes 
[02:51:30]  Of just screaming  You need to get into this  I'm like  I'm not cutting off  Yeah, you're cutting him off  Fuck that, right  And if you watch the rerun  To this day  I half-ass  The first 30 seconds  While they're on  Then you go on YouTube  And watch it  Yeah  While they're on  I'm going  Mr. Pesci  Mr. De Niro  I'm saying it so low  Because I'm not  I'm not stopping the crowd  From going nuts  Yeah, yeah  Hell no  Colin was fucking hysterical  On that too 
[02:52:00]  Colin Quinn  Remote K-12  He was great  By the way  Lorne got fucking De Niro  On Fallon's show  He was the first guest  Dude  You're right  Lorne's a powerful guy  Powerful  He's a powerful dude  Powerful  He got De Niro  To do an interview  On Fallon's  Who's not  The interviewer  Like Letterman is  Or a lot of guys  Have been doing it  For 20 years  Dude  Lorne is  Powerful  His best friend's a Beatle  Show's over  Who?  McCartney  Are they friends?  Yes 
[02:52:30]  Dude  Lorne's  Power  That was one of the  He couldn't get the Beatle thing together though  It came close, right?  No, that was a bit  That was hysterical  Years and years and years ago  When like  What was it?  Lennon and McCartney  McCartney  It's so funny  Sitting around and going  Let's go to SNL  And it almost happened  I forgot the story  I just remember the bit  From when  Lorne was like a fucking kid  It was the first season  I think of SNL  He looked so young  And he looked like  It's not even the same guy  It's a complete different entity now  Yeah  But he came out with a check  For like a thousand dollars 
[02:53:00]  Oh, okay  And he goes  I'm offering the Beatles  One thousand dollars  To a year on this show  And it was like  You're watching  This is ridiculous  Right  This is hysterical  But then the other side of that  They were going to do it as a goof  And just walk on one night  Maybe later  Yeah, much later  It was in a few of the Beatles books  That they were thinking about  It came really close  To just doing it  Wow  I don't remember now  I think it was just  Lennon and McCartney  Oh, that's right  Lorne even goes  One night in New York  He said something like  You know, you could split it up  However you want  You could give Ringo less  That's funny 
[02:53:30]  That was good, man  I got all jealous  When I saw that  Dana Carvey special  When he talked about  Smoking a joint  With Paul McCartney  And Lorne Michaels  And I was like  You were getting  Get out with McCartney  Pretty good night  Yeah  Ozzy's a big McCartney fan  So he speaks very  Very hero worship  He talks about McCartney  The way I talk about him  It's humiliating  Dude, all the English guys  Brian Johnson  ACDC  I saw him down in Florida  He spoke a half hour 
[02:54:00]  On McCartney  He's like  Jim, I'm telling you  My son  It's the greatest thing  You ever seen in your life  He comes out  And he  You ever hear the Blackbird song?  The little Bluebird song?  He goes into the store  He sits down  It's a nice setting  And he tells about  His first time in America  And he says  You know  We came to America  And we said  This is the greatest  New land in the world  And the open mind  So the whole situation  And we couldn't wait  To be here  And then we went on a bus  And we noticed  The Negroes were in the back 
[02:54:30]  And that's when we realized  Wow, maybe this country  Isn't as far advanced  As we thought it was  So that's why we wrote  Me and  We never finished the lyrics  So this is for me  And George  And he goes into the  Little Blackbirds  And I was like  I never knew  That's what that song  Was about  No clue  Black chick  On the bus  What the fuck is that about  But  The way he talked  They worship  McCartney  They worship  All of them 
[02:55:00]  McCartney  I knew Ozzy did  But I was surprised  When I asked Lemmy  Who his  Because Lemmy  He's just a crank animal  Lemmy's an animal  Right  And he's like  Little fuck  Little fuck  I mean like  A hero worship  It's really great  Yeah  I love the fact  That those guys love him  Yes  And it makes you  Wonder more about  Like the girl  Like huh  Let me investigate him more  He really is a god  He's a god  And he's a fan of mine  Which was weird  Because it's like circular  Lemmy?  No  McCartney  Oh  Sick 
[02:55:30]  I made that up  He wouldn't know me  If I jumped up and down  Yelling Beatles  You never know  No I just wanted  I just wanted to  See what that felt like  Coming out  Wonderful by the way  Wonderful  A lot of SNL stories  In the book bro  Yeah yeah  I like your Chris Farley stuff  I like that  You know  You're talking about  Hanging out with Tracy Morgan  And the crazy fucking times  You guys got into  Tracy's that  The raping Will  We used to  Repeatedly rape Will  That's right 
[02:56:00]  We used to rape Will Fowl  Just to make him  Break character  Because he would never  He dressed up as a character  For like two straight weeks  It was so annoying  It was so annoying  Because you're like  Will  He's like  I'm not Will  I'm Ron Burgundy  Right  Alright well Ron  Can we talk  He's like  I'm busy this week  With art  And so this went on  For weeks and weeks  And Tracy  Can never pronounce his name right  He called him Pharrell  Will Pharrell  He'd be like  Let's play characters  And break Will Pharrell  Let's rape him  And we 
[02:56:30]  So me  Colin Quinn  And Tracy  Repeatedly raped  Like fake raped him  For hours  We'd leave him in a dumpster  Take his clothes off  And he would never  Break character  It was so obnoxious  That's nasty  Hey Will Pharrell  Will would be  Tracy would be  In the doorway  As we're fake rape  As we're  Lily pulling his pants down  Tracy would be  In the doorway  With an unlit cigarette  Going  Hurry up  And save me  Some of that  How many years 
[02:57:00]  Were you on  Just three  Okay I thought  It was actually  Less than that  Three  It was three years  And  That was just enough  You like Lauren  You guys have a good relationship  I thank God  I love Lauren  Always really respected Lauren  And I always  Lauren's one of those guys  That  They're like a hidden prophet  He comes and tells you  And about three years later  You go  Oh shit  Now I understand  What he was saying  And he 
[02:57:30]  He would always  Go out of his way  To give me advice  And  You know  Even at the end  When I said  I really wanted to quit  Because I couldn't stand  The head writer there anymore  And  He's like  Jim  You're too nice  For this industry  You're too nice  For the show  It first started off  With him going  Why don't you  Take him out to dinner  I'm like  Alright  I'll call him  And I'll see him  To dinner  But 
[02:58:00]  You know  And the guy  Totally denies  Oh dude  I'm not trying to fire you  No  I know you are  Is he still there or no  No he went off  And started writing  For Will Ferrell  Will Ferrell  Will Ferrell  He writes for Will Ferrell  I worked  I did  Colin Quinn's show  And he did the  Monday night  Live  I did two of the three  And we had to go in  And pitch  We had to go in  The Lauren's office  And have those meetings  So I didn't even  I knew who Lauren was  Of course  Yeah  But the impact  Didn't have a big deal  On me  Because I was never  An SNL fan 
[02:58:30]  But in hindsight  I realized  That was a very  Nerve wracking experience  All those two weeks  As you move on  You realize  Like wow  This guy  Is  A king  He's a king  Be careful  You know  This is when I realized  How powerful  Lauren Michaels was too  Because whenever  I go to Hollywood  Try to get a deal  Whatever  A lot of times  The first question  They ask  Everything good  With you and Lauren  And you're like  Well  What's I got to do  With this  What's this got to do  He's  They don't want to 
[02:59:00]  Fuck shit up  He's bigger than  Everyone thinks he is  Man  He's bigger than  Everyone thinks he is  When was the last time  You watched  A Saturday Night Live  When De Niro hosted  Really  I was on the road  And I was dying to watch  When De Niro hosted  When was that  I want to say  It was a couple  Fallon was still on  So I want to say  It was  Years ago  So  And De Niro  Put on the elf  He dressed up as an elf  And he was like  This little  Flaky elf  And I was  Howling 
[02:59:30]  Howling  It was a great  Great episode  And then Freddie Armisen  I graduated high school with  So once in a while  I would see what Freddie's up to  Wait  Did you guys know each other  In high school  We did  That's so weird  That's fucking weird  That is an odd little thing  I don't  I don't think Freddie  I don't know this for a fact  Freddie was into his own  Freddie  Had a  Mohawk  Before  Mohawks were cool  So it looked like a lunatic  Yes 
[03:00:00]  But he wasn't a lunatic  He was  He was  I can't explain it  He's a beautiful sister  Oh yeah  Wow  Older or younger  Younger  I was friends with his sister  Sister was just  You just  Just drop dead  Beautiful  Beautiful  Freddie  He always made  I don't think he liked me  I don't think he liked my  He was into like  His own little crowd 
[03:00:30]  And  His crowd was like  You know  Like they were into  Dead Kennies  Or  Really  Really obscure bands  A little too hip for you  Yeah I think so  To this guy I'm sure  A little more straightforward  Rock guy  I was a little bothered  Not bothered  But  When he got  Center Live  I was excited  Like oh wow  Another guy  A guy from my high school  And I tried everything  To get him on radio  I tried everything  And every time I talked  He was just very  Distant  And refuses  And I went alright  He wouldn't come on  Your radio show  No  Maybe you were an asshole 
[03:01:00]  In high school  Maybe he thought  You were banging his sister  Trust me  That goes back to high school  But maybe that's what he thought  Maybe  Maybe  No he would have known  It has to do with high school  Something happened in high school  I think so  Maybe you banged a chick  That he liked  I can assure you  I didn't  Because I was  I was dating  A girl from a Catholic  So it wasn't even  I never dated anyone  From my high school  So  No  We really  Maybe it was my  Judas Priest denim jacket  That bothered him 
[03:01:30]  Yeah he would probably  Just want to  You guys would have  A lot to talk about too  So much  That's weird  So much  Really fast  Lane in Jersey  Jim's Lauren  Michael's impression  Sounds like Dr. Evil  It is  It's the same thing  Yeah well they've said  That character is Lauren Michael  Yeah it is  Absolutely  Yeah Mike Myers  Matter of fact  Came up with Dr. Evil  Michael Myers has never  We had him on the show once  I have a conspiracy about Michael  Yeah  About him doing  The Dr. Evil and all that  Which I could be wrong  But here's my conspiracy  For some reason I think 
[03:02:00]  For some reason I think  He left and not happy about leaving  SNL  And so  He wrote that movie  Because it's very  As a Saturday Night Live  Cast member  That movie is  All about Saturday Night Live  All about Saturday Night Live  Dr. Evil is Lauren  The  All the people  That have the henchmen  That's all like  The head writers  And producers  I sat there  And belly laughed  Watching this thing  But  He came on 
[03:02:30]  Like  Three weeks  Before the movie  Came out  Because supposedly  Lauren doesn't like  If you imitate him  Or whatever  And  When the movie came out  Became a hit  And he never went  He never hosted again  I don't think he ever  Hosted SNL again  So it was his little  Bap  And  I'm out of here  So there's a lot of  Inside stuff in that movie  Oh it's so  I watched that  It's so  It's a different movie  For you isn't it  A thousand percent  To me that movie  Is a hundred percent  Oh how great is that  Behind the scenes 
[03:03:00]  Of SNL  How  Lauren had to know  Of course  He probably saw that movie  I mean everything he did  With the thumb  He imitated Lauren  Wow  It's Lauren to a T  To a T  And even the head writers  And producers  Like he would  He'd have them all  At the table  The cast members  Was the kid  Remember the kid  Who was like  Dad  That was every cast member  That represented  The entire cast  Of SNL  Scott  I'm telling you  Scott  He represented  The cast members  That's the first time  I'm hearing that 
[03:03:30]  That's great  Without a doubt  That is fucking funny man  Before we move on  From SNL  Yeah  I totally believe that  I loved your Chris Farley story  In the book  I just loved the fucking book  Yeah  I'm sounding like a fanboy  No but you texted me  And you were like  I was texting you  As I was reading it  I know  Because I needed to know  Who was certain people  In the book  Yeah  You were like  Who's this guy  And who's that guy  Yeah he changed the fucking names  To protect the innocent  Yes  Or protect the guilty  Actually yeah  I guess  What do you have to say 
[03:04:00]  About Chris Farley  I mean  You don't have to tell  The story in the book  But  That was more of a  That was a more of a  He was just in a  In a bad fucking place  When he came back  To SNL obviously  Well yeah  He came back  To host  It was very bad  I was very excited  To meet him  Not meet him  But work with him  Right  And everyone talked about him  He's the greatest guy  In the world  He's the funniest guy  In the world  And I didn't get it  Until I met him  And then I realized  Oh  Now I see  He just takes 
[03:04:30]  He takes a room over  Takes it over  And he's got this  Tremendous  Beautiful energy  Oh Jimmy  Oh God  I've been listening  To you Anthony  Oh my God  When you do that voice  The eyes are gone  And he just  He's  You instantly  Laugh  He's beautiful  Yeah  So when he came  In our room  I was thinking  He's gonna love me  And the first thing  He asked for  He's like  Jimmy  I know you got weed  I know you got 
[03:05:00]  Where's the weed  And he opened up  Tracy's drawer  And there was  You know  Juice  And he opened up  My drawer  And he found  And back then  Yeah  I'd have one hitter  So  He hits that  But then he goes  After whatever he did  He goes  In the office  And he starts  Freaking  He looks like  A crack addict  And after that happened  One of the producers  Came up to me  And Tracy  And he shuts  The door  And she's like  What'd you two do  Oh shit  I didn't  Give me that bullshit  He's talking about  You two 
[03:05:30]  You're new best friends  And he's gonna be  Hanging out with you  All week  Let me tell you something  We have a 24 hour nurse  Chris Rock is here  Because in case  There's a serious problem  Going on with him  You guys  If he calls you  Don't answer  If he has to go out  You're not to go out  We have a  This is not funny  It's serious  This is a  It's bigger than you think  I'm like  Okay  And Tracy was like  I'm a grown man  I got children  You call me  Talking to me  Like a child  I ain't no child 
[03:06:00]  I got a grown man  I got children  You talk to me  Like I'm five years old  And I'm like  Tracy  That's cool  It's alright  Don't worry about it  We're good  Long story  And that week  He called  And my wife  Picked up  And she's like  Oh he's on the phone  I don't know  How he got my number  But that phone call  Shook me  Forever  Cause he  He's on the phone  He's like  Jimmy  We're hanging out  Blah blah blah 
[03:06:30]  And then all of a sudden  I hear him  Cup the phone  Like walk in the bathroom  He's like  Jimmy  Am I funny man  Or am I just  A fat stupid guy  Oh fuck  I went  No  Christian please  Be honest  No one's ever on  Be honest with me  Jimmy  Am I  Am I just  Fat and stupid  Stupid  Ain't I stupid  Dude you're not  You know  And I started going  In the story  How everyone  Talked about him  The hairdressers  The wardrobe  The grips 
[03:07:00]  The camera guys  They loved you  Are you just  Saying that  Why do they always  Make me the stupid guy  And  I  I went from  I'm going to be  In Black Sheep 2  To  Now I'm walking  Him off a ledge  Yeah  Yeah  And  That week  Was really  Disturbing  Because  I fell in love  With the guy  As a performer  And as a person  At the same time  I really  Looked at the industry 
[03:07:30]  As cold and malice  Because  Why go through  With this  When this guy  Clearly  Is on the verge  Of killing himself  By accident  Yeah  And  Why go through  The trouble  Of walking around  With a nurse  And Chris Rock  Is what  Like Chris  Are you doing  I'm here  Just in case  Just in case  I'm going to be  In the back  And they had  Chris Rock  Just in case  Was rehearsing  All week  Yes  To step in 
[03:08:00]  Just in case  Just in case  He dies  Or ODs  That's how bad  It was  Fuck  But that's  Wow  That really  That really  That bothered me  For like  Just for humanity  In itself  And then a couple  Months later  I couldn't stop  Thinking of him  I could not  Stop thinking  Of him  And  I turned to my wife  I'm like  I keep getting  This feeling  Chris Farley  Is in a lot  Of trouble  And I need  To talk to him 
[03:08:30]  I need  He needs someone  True  I really need  To talk to him  She's like  Well I didn't  Call him  I said  I don't know  What am I  Going to say  To him  I don't  I don't  Have his  Number  I don't  Ah  It's just  Like  No  No  Every time  You get  That feeling  Go with it  You're always  Just go with it  So I called up  The guy in the book  What do I call him  I call him  Not the rat  I call him  Leon  Leon  I call up Leon  I'm like  Leon  I need  Farley's number  Yeah  I want  I said  Listen  I  I said 
[03:09:00]  Leon  I have this  Feeling  I need  To talk  To Farley  I feel  Like he's  In trouble  I really  Need to  Talk to him  He's like  You'd be  A great  Friend  I'll get  His number  He didn't  Get the  Number  And then  You know  I'm doing  Shows  And then  The following  Three days  Later  I'm like  Leon  The number  I need  His number  Oh sorry  Man  Tomorrow  I'm in the  Office  I'll get  It for you  And then  He died  And  Not that  I would  Have  Changed  Anything  But I  I just  Remember  The feeling  I had  Was  I had 
[03:09:30]  This feeling  Inside me  I was like  I told  You  To call  Him  Don't ever  Ignore  That feeling  Again  This feeling  Is here  For a  Reason  Not saying  You would  Have saved  Them  But  When the  Feeling  Is there  It's real  Just go  With it  Just go  With it  And I  Procrastinated  I talked  Myself  Bad  I thought  It was  Weird  It was  Freaky  So yeah  I was like  I will never  Ignore that  Feeling again  That leads  To the last  Thing  And I watched  Star Wars  Ten straight  Times  Use the 
[03:10:00]  Force  That leads  To the last  Thing I want  To talk  About with  Brewer  He's got  Like five  Minutes  Left  Okay  Your  Spirituality  I didn't  Know you  Were a  God  Guy  Known you  For a  Really  Long  Time  Well I've  Had some  Bizarre  I've had  Bizarre  Circumstances  You know  I don't  I never  Read a  Bible  I've  Never  Not a  Church  Guy  Were you  Baptized  And all  That  We were  Talking  About  That  Earlier  No  I was  Never  Baptized
