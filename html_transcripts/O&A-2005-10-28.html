<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a graphic and profane recounting of the hosts' Mardi Gras experiences in New Orleans, detailing public nudity and violence.  This segued into a lengthy discussion of Anthony's divorce, focusing on his grievances with his ex-wife, including criticisms of her personality, her perceived lack of support for his career, and her assigned household chores.  Bill Burr guest-hosted for Jim Norton.  The segment included numerous obscene jokes and a song with extremely offensive lyrics.  The hosts also discussed their career struggles and highlights, and mentioned a post-show party with significant alcohol consumption.

Next, Opie and Anthony recounted attending a Rolling Stones concert, favorably comparing Mick Jagger to James Hetfield, praising Jagger's crowd interaction despite his age.  They discussed the long intermission between Alanis Morissette (whose performance had poor attendance) and the Rolling Stones, contrasting it with quicker transitions in the past. They noted the concert's multi-generational audience and the constant overhead flights.

A major portion of the show focused on a Daily News "Scratch and Match" contest with a misprint leading to many believing they won $100,000.  Staff member Eric Nagel won the subsequent drawing, but a significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a heated argument about the hosts allegedly leaving Nagel behind at the concert.  Nagel, who drove himself and had different seating and wristbands, claimed unsuccessful attempts to contact them due to phone issues.  The hosts countered that they waited, called, and texted, blaming Nagel for not communicating his situation.  Nagel expressed resentment with insults directed at the hosts, while the hosts argued alternative transportation options were available.  Listener calls further fueled the debate, leaving the blame unresolved.

A heated exchange between Opie and Eric followed, with Opie criticizing Eric's perceived ingratitude for launching his career, recounting picking him up in Florida and sharing a meal. Opie threatened Eric, expressing disappointment. Eric offered a reluctant apology. This led to a dispute over scratch-off lottery tickets where Eric won $100,000, prompting suspicion of using a station ticket.  Tensions rose with accusations and counter-accusations, leading to a negotiated settlement of $1,000 to each of the ten staff members.

A call with Stalker Patty followed, detailing her slot tournament experiences in Atlantic City, her small winnings, and her modest lifestyle.  This transitioned to a discussion of misused FEMA debit cards at strip clubs and an update from Jim Norton in Los Angeles, filming an HBO series.  Norton described a disastrous encounter with a woman and a roach infestation in his apartment.  The segment concluded with the announcement of a date between Stalker Patty and Big A, a taxi driver, scheduled for Thursday at Paisano's in Little Italy, with a staff chaperone.  Paisano's received extensive promotion, offering a free glass of wine to listeners mentioning the show. Dane Cook's later appearance was mentioned.

The show then focused on Jim Norton's Los Angeles experiences, including travel woes with Northwest Airlines, and various nightmare comedy gigs.  Bill Burr recounted a brutal gig in Lee, Massachusetts, where he was hit with a buttered roll, and stories of performing with other comedians in difficult situations, including a disastrous show with a sabotaged magician. Dane Cook, appearing in-studio for the first time, discussed his chaotic MTV Video Music Awards experience, limited performance time, and other horror stories, including a college gig with a girl exposing her breasts.  The conversation frequently covered the difficulties of comedy, awkward audience interactions, and Bob Kelly's knee injury (with listener-submitted remixes).  A caller, "Dragon Wagon," expressed offense at the show's content, leading to a heated exchange.  The segment promoted Dane Cook's Madison Square Garden show and Bill Burr's HBO special.

Dane Cook remained a primary guest, discussing hecklers, including bizarre and offensive heckles, and differing audience reactions between white and black crowds. He recounted being essentially fired from a corporate gig for refusing to alter his material, keeping only one of two payments.  A caller, Sarah, recounted a funny experience at a Dane Cook and Bob Kelly show, mentioning backstage encounters and the comedians signing her friendâ€™s breasts.  Bob Kelly called in, describing his bike taxi ride home, sharing humorous anecdotes with Cook, including a story about defecating in a wastebasket on a tour bus and using a humidifier as a urinal. He also discussed his long hair and a game called "Punch in the Asshole" that Cook supposedly invented.  The show concluded with a humorous critique of a Martha Stewart and P. Diddy rap collaboration, promotional announcements for Cook's shows, and the *Torgasm* DVD release.  Bill Burr continued to fill in for Jim Norton throughout the broadcast.

[00:03:30]  Oh, he's laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And he's stinky.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The movie is the show.  The movie is the show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm scared of you, sir. 
[00:04:30]  And I'm protecting myself.  I'm protecting myself.  I'm scared of you.  Please call the police.  Hello, exactly.  Hello, exactly.  Come on, everybody.  Wake up.  Rise and shine.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  O-N-A Party Rock.  Arr.  O-N-A Party Rock.  O-N-A Party Rock.  Arr.  O-N-A Party Rock. 
[00:05:00]  O-N-A Party Rock.  O-N-A Party Rock.  O-N-A Party Rock.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Hey, what's happening?  What's happening?  Hi.  Ooh, who's the chicken chase?  What?  I don't know.  Front page of news then.  Is that Lil' Kim?  I thought she was supposed to go to jail.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  All the disasters are over, I guess.  Everything's fine in New Orleans again, I guess.  Yeah, pretty much.  All the water's pumped out.  Everybody's back home.  Everyone's back to work.  The economy's great.  Back to school.  Because the cover of the papers, I see nothing about it.  I see Yankees back on there.  Oh, wait.  Newsday.  Okay, Newsday has it.  City will rise again.  Yes.  The great Phoenix, that is New Orleans. 
[00:06:00]  Phoenix?  You know, I ripped out a couple great stories, and I forgot to bring them in here.  Oops.  Travis, if you will.  Thank you, sir.  New Orleans is one of the scariest cities I've ever been to.  That's what we said.  Absolutely.  We went to two Mardi Gras, and I would walk around in the morning, get coffee and stuff,  you know, before it got wild, and I was scared.  Did you feel like when you were on Bourbon Street at night that, okay, this is cool as long as  I stay on this street, but if I literally go 10 feet to the left or to the right, something's  going to have to look at, like a chicken foot up to my neck, a little fucking voodoo doll. 
[00:06:30]  That's the only place I've ever seen, I mean, even living here in New York, just saw a dude  expose himself.  Yeah.  We were standing underneath one of those show your tits balconies.  Another great thing about New Orleans that was almost washed away in the tragedy.  And I looked over, and there was literally a guy who had, like, his shirt tails, like,  pulled out of his pants, but I was to the side, and he was fat, so kind of pushed out,  and he had his whole unit, dick and balls, were just out.  Just hanging out. 
[00:07:00]  And I looked, I was horrified.  It took me, like, half a second before I could stand.  He's got his dick!  And the dude literally, calm as can be, like, a totally professional pervert, just kind  of slipped back into the crowd, and you're like, and then, was it, Silence of the Lamb?  Oh, yeah.  He's going home, and he kind of, like, goes into the living room.  That's exactly what he did.  He just disappeared.  Not even putting his dick back in his pants, he just slipped back into the crowd.  That city is frightening, man.  Yeah, it definitely is.  Unless you stay, even when you do stay on Bourbon Street, it's frightening. 
[00:07:30]  But then you go into the little outskirt areas where, you know, Ben, Ben was with us,  and he's like, no, dude, I know this nice restaurant over here.  And we start walking, and you notice the crowds thinning a little bit, and now you're seeing  some of the locals, the people that aren't, you know, from out of town, looking around  like, oh, this isn't good.  You're leaving the herd.  Yeah, leaving the herd.  That's what you're doing.  You're grazing to the side.  And the side streets are trying to keep Mardi Gras going, but it's a whole different thing.  The zebra in the middle of the herd is never the one that gets the teeth sunk into his 
[00:08:00]  neck.  Oh, exactly.  It's always the ones that are on the outskirts, the one that doesn't leave at the herd because  he wants to drink a little more water at the watering hole.  The ones that consider themselves free spirits.  Right.  He's got to check all the things out.  They're all great.  Yeah, there's a flyer laying on the jungle floor.  Hey, after party.  After party.  Yeah, we just saw a gang of black kids just beating the shit out of white people as they  walked by.  Yeah.  That was it.  White people would walk by. 
[00:08:30]  Black people would walk by them and they wouldn't even look at them.  And then a white guy and girl.  I think that's part of their town logo.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  Them just grabbing by the throat and punching the face of a white person.  And white people would walk by, a guy and a girl, and the guy would be punched and the  girl would just be molested, groped right there.  And they would finally get pulled out of the crowd and they'd be laughing their asses  off.  We're watching from a balcony across the street, watching the entire thing.  It was like watching Wild Kingdom or something. 
[00:09:00]  That one year of the Puerto Rican Day Parade was our tribute to New Orleans.  Yeah.  Great job.  You should have got sued.  And then the cops came over and busted him up and dragged a couple of them away.  And that was cool.  And then we spoke up.  Then we're like, yeah, motherfucker!  You're busted!  They're throwing them in cars.  Beforehand, we're just looking at them.  Why are you showing how brave we are?  Here comes another white couple.  Oh, this is going to be bad.  Oh, no.  Just kind of commenting on them and doing nothing. 
[00:09:30]  Because they're pussies.  So I guess it's all cleaned up down there because the papers are moving on to bigger and better  things.  Like Renee Zellweger.  Her marriage is over after five months.  Big surprise there, everybody.  Oh, is that true?  Renee just walks away.  Annulment in works for Zellweger and that country singer she married out of nowhere.  Oh, right.  What the hell is his name?  Kenny Chesney.  Kenny Chesney. 
[00:10:00]  They hooked up.  I guess they met at some tsunami thing.  Yeah.  I've been to that concert.  That's when they hooked up.  They dated for a very short time and then decided to get married.  And it was, you know, she was, he was his, her prince.  And she, he wrote a song about her based on her, uh, character and, uh, what movie was  that?  Jerry Maguire.  That's like.  You had me at hello.  It's like one notch below getting the tattoo of your girlfriend. 
[00:10:30]  Just writing some sappy fucking song that'll never go away.  Some ass song that like, it was a hit of his, I guess.  I never heard it.  Like J-Lo did that deer bend.  You know, she cringes.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That CD is not in any of her mansions.  Because it's immortalized, you know, it's out there, it's done, you did it.  And, uh, no matter how much you hate the person now, that song is out there.  Professing your love.  They have a kid someday.  Who's Ben? 
[00:11:00]  That's about London.  I was talking about that.  I was talking about that clock.  It's a producer with wild hair on the Ovi and Anthony show.  He hurt and he jerked.  So, that's over, but that's the front page of the New York Daily News.  Called it quits.  She, uh, she filed and all it says, divorce papers are very vague all the time.  And, um, I guess in California you have a lot of options as to what you can base your divorce on. 
[00:11:30]  In New York, you really only have cruel and inhuman treatment and, uh, infidelity is the other one.  And there's like, there might be one more, but I don't know.  The other one is lack of sex.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there is.  There's, um...  Oh, really?  That was a joke.  Yeah, lack of sex or something.  That was a joke.  They call it something else.  But if you haven't had sex for, like, a year, uh, you can get a divorce. 
[00:12:00]  Um, if you're separated, legally separated, for a year, then you can get a divorce without one of those wacky things put in there.  But if you want a divorce quickly, you have to come up with an idea.  With some kind of, one of these three things that New York allows.  Mm-hmm.  No irreconcilable?  No, they don't have irreconcilable differences in New York.  That's the one I was gunning for.  I had to go for, uh, a cruel and inhuman treatment or something.  Well, I could have been a star witness for you.  But it was the other way around. 
[00:12:30]  I was being treated cruelly and inhumanly.  But that wasn't what happened.  I would have been on your side.  Don't worry about it.  That wasn't what happened.  I was the one that was served the papers that said that.  That you were treating her bad?  Yes!  I'm sorry.  The money I gave you wasn't clean enough, perhaps.  All I remember is...  The dates on it weren't the numbers she enjoyed.  All I remember...  What can I say?  How cruel could I have been?  All I remember is pulling up to Anthony's house.  We used to commute back then.  It would be, uh, like 9.15 in the morning. 
[00:13:00]  And Anthony sleeps right up until I'm pulling up.  I know that about him, right?  And he's at the front door, and his wife is just yelling at him.  Yeah, as I was walking out.  Yelling at him at 9.15, and I know Aunt might have woke up at 9.  I'm serious.  So he gets in the car, and I'm like, Aunt, what could you have possibly done?  The garbage, Opie.  The garbage.  Wow.  What do you mean the garbage?  I, um, I...  It's my job, and I didn't do it.  Like, Anthony had jobs.  I had jobs around the house.  Like, the garbage was my job. 
[00:13:30]  You know when you're a kid, and you have, like, chores?  Like, you gotta mow the lawn, take out the garbage.  The cat box was my job.  Was that, like, a first, like, serious relationship for you?  Because it didn't seem like...  You didn't set up the guidelines correctly.  No, I fucking dropped the ball on the guidelines, man.  If that happens, you have to flip out.  I, I, I didn't.  I really fucked up.  I didn't set the, uh, set the bar early.  If you don't break a couple of dishes or punch a wall within the first six weeks, you can get you done.  No, I cruised nine years. 
[00:14:00]  Nine years of OK Sweetie.  That was it.  Nine years of OK Sweetie.  And, and that was it.  It was, and, and, and Opie would pull up.  I'd leave the house to, you know, and, you know, I asked you to do the goddamn garbage.  And it's sitting here.  All right.  All right.  Well, Opie's here.  I gotta go do my show.  This is the behind the scenes of a guy that was becoming a radio rock star.  Like, all right, I'll.  We were becoming radio rock stars and people had no idea what was going on behind the scenes. 
[00:14:30]  See you later.  No clue.  He's getting yelled at.  I was going to say.  I remember one.  I remember.  What, what, what?  I was going to say.  I thought you guys were doing OK.  But just the beginning of you pulling up to pick him up, just that visual didn't have you guys making a lot of money in my brain right now.  No, we did have that Fred and Barney type relationship with the driving to work.  But once we got in, it was kind of.  Honestly, we were doing afternoon drive.  Very good.  We were commuting from Long Island.  And now, even, you know, off hours, it was a pain in the ass.  So we took turns is what it was. 
[00:15:00]  So one guy could mellow out and, you know, in the past, read the papers and do whatever.  So we would take turns.  And we lived.  Yeah, we lived really close to each other.  We lived about a half a mile from each other.  Oh, OK.  But I would pull up and there were.  You know, I don't ask much.  I don't ask much.  It's the garbage, the cat box.  You got to get.  I was.  I got cat box duty.  This is now.  This is from a guy.  I don't want cats.  Don't get me wrong.  I like cats.  I think kittens are probably the cutest little things on the face of the earth. 
[00:15:30]  They're big faces, the eyes, the head too big for the little kitten bodies.  Their poop doesn't smell as bad.  No, it doesn't.  No, it's not as bad as a grown cat.  Yeah.  He's gone to McDonald's for 20 years.  She got a cat.  So now it's my cat.  Then she wants to get another cat for the cat to have company.  So she gets another cat, a female cat.  Neither of the two are fixed.  What do you think is going to happen?  So now we have a whole litter of cats that have to be given away. 
[00:16:00]  We give away cats except for two.  Now we have four cats.  She's turning into crazy cat lady.  Four cats.  In this house.  And I get cat box detail.  It's like.  Oh my God.  We had chores.  It's a twice a day like thing to do because I don't like walking into a house and it's  smelling like cat shit.  It was just a nightmare.  It's funny.  If I literally saw that, I could never go into the house.  Of course not. 
[00:16:30]  I had a buddy of mine one time.  He was with this girl and I went over there.  I was just staying, you know, for a couple of days.  You know, when you have company, you kind of try to, you know, there was some huge fucking  game on like Lakers, Celtics.  This is a few years, a huge fucking game.  And she huffed and puffed.  And next thing we're watching like fucking Little House on the Prairie or something.  Oh, Jesus.  And she's just sitting and I'm looking at him and I'm just waiting for her to go to the  bathroom.  And I had one of those really like, like loud whispering.  Dude, you can't fucking say that.  This is fucking bullshit. 
[00:17:00]  Fucking Lakers, Celtics.  It's game seven.  What's wrong with you?  And then she comes back up.  Hey, Marie.  How are you doing?  And I'm looking and I'm like, have the confrontation.  Do it.  Hello.  I'm going to go outside and start smoking.  I've never done that before.  I'll be back in, I'll give you seven minutes to fucking correct this, you idiot.  Oh, great.  I went out and bought a couch.  Bought a nice couch.  Actually, the first, I think, nice thing I ever bought because we had come from Massachusetts.  I was living in Ashland, Mass. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, I know.  This is the worst fucking story I've ever seen.  Shit hole.  Yeah, we moved up because I got the gig with Opie.  It was my first radio job.  I was in construction.  I didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, as my mother always would  say.  And we move up to Ashland, Mass.  Because Opie gets a house in Newton, and I moved to Ashland.  Where are you in Newton?  Wellesley.  Wellesley.  All right.  Sorry.  I wasn't making that much more than him at the time. 
[00:18:00]  He was, we were still, we were still.  Don't all those houses have like ivy growing up the size of them?  Oh, please.  Believe it or not, they have shit holes in Wellesley.  It's where, Newton and Wellesley is where Mass herds all their Jews.  All their Jews are there.  That's the area.  Yeah, I just want to live as close to Boston as possible, because, you know, the radio station  was way out in the suburbs.  The radio station, I lived like a mile away from the station.  I didn't want to live in Boston, because that wasn't where the station was.  They made it sound like they were in Boston, W-A-A-F, Boston.  And they're out in friggin' Westboro. 
[00:18:30]  It was nowhere, an industrial park.  And so I lived, first of all, I had to go with the wife and live with her mother for  a while in her condo.  Oh, my God.  With Opie.  So it's me, Opie, my wife, and my mother-in-law in this small little townhouse.  And we were on a rocket ship to becoming radio.  Rocketing to stardom.  To become radio rock stars, but no one knew what the hell was going on behind the scenes. 
[00:19:00]  So we figured, thank God, you know, mothers and daughters have a hard time living together  for any length of time.  So we got a place really quickly, but we got a place.  It was garden apartments in Ashland, Mass., with, like, I was the only white person living  there.  It was all Brazilians and, like, other people from South America, Ecuador, I swear to you.  Columbians.  Columbians, everything.  The parking lot had these potholes in it that were huge, and when it rained, the children 
[00:19:30]  would go out in their diapers and stuff and bathe and, like, use it like a pool.  There were chickens.  One guy chicken-wired off his balcony, off the apartment.  But it wasn't his balcony.  Yeah.  It was shared space.  You know, in apartments you have shared space in the back there?  He had a balcony, like the little wrought iron patio.  That was his.  Because it was a ground floor.  It wasn't a balcony. 
[00:20:00]  It was a wrought iron patio.  But he chicken-wired off, like, a whole area around that and just filled it with chickens.  There were chickens in this garden.  And I'm living there.  I'm living there.  I know you didn't say shit to some Columbian.  Of course I didn't.  Chicken-wired.  Did he go out and slaughter them right in front of you for his evening dinner?  Or a couple of times there would be a few missing and then there were new ones.  So you knew he was just slitting their throat.  You heard a disturbance.  Yeah.  Feathers flow by your fucking window.  But that's what we were doing. 
[00:20:30]  We were living there.  And it was a mile away from the mother's house and a couple of miles away from the station.  And it was all, you know, it was all my wife's doing.  Like, what she said, that's what I did because I was just coasting through life.  Like, I was constantly waiting for something better but doing really nothing to try to get it.  Like, the whole radio thing.  I would have been in Huntington, New York, a tin knocker, installing air conditioning and heating, 
[00:21:00]  and just doing that, hoping something came along.  And you know what?  Something just happened to drop in my lap.  Hello.  Radio.  It was just complete luck of the draw that it happened.  But I still would have been there.  And then the whole thing that happened with the apartment out there is she got that one.  And I was like, yeah, fine.  I'll live with the Columbians in Ashland.  A mile away from your life.  Was she just trying to save money?  We weren't making a lot.  I really wasn't making a lot.  And nothing, you know, obviously, I was brand new. 
[00:21:30]  It was my first radio gig.  Opie's been in it for years at this point.  So, obviously, he was getting paid more than I was.  They weren't even sure I was going to work out.  You know, it was one of those things.  I thought I'd be back tin knocking again.  I thought it would be a goof to do radio for a while.  So, Opie was making more than me.  I was making, at that time, less.  I got hired to do radio for less than I was making in construction.  So, yeah, I had no money.  So, was your wife just trashing this dream every day?  Yeah, actually.  She almost...  Almost didn't have me do it.  She almost fucked up the whole thing. 
[00:22:00]  Because she wanted me to call now.  Now, the GM to WAF throws out an offer.  And it is for less money than I was making.  I think I was making $29,000 a year doing construction.  This is a 95.  Removing asbestos.  Yeah, exactly.  And he was offering me $25,000 to do radio.  And I'm like, fine.  I'll take the hit because I don't know what's going to happen.  And Bruce, he said to us, boys, if it works out in a few months, don't worry, Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  We'll bring you up.  And we both took the hit, by the way.  I wasn't making much more than Anthony.  No.  After many years in radio.  Just to sit here and shoot the shit.  Right.  Or fucking install air conditioners.  Exactly.  And I said to Anthony, I'm like, this is a star.  Trust me on this.  We'll get more money.  You know, we just got to establish ourselves.  And she could work.  It was like, you know.  Right.  She'd go out and get a job, which she did.  And I explained, too, we'll make some side money, possibly, with gigs and stuff.  Yeah.  Whatever.  So, I was like, don't worry about it.  You'll get it.  So, I go, schnookums, I got the offer. 
[00:23:00]  Big dream to do radio.  I want to go to Boston.  How much?  It was all about the money.  Well, was your hat in your hand?  Yeah.  I was crinkling my hat in my hand all nervously working it.  It's like, well, it's $25,000 a year, but the BU came out for but.  Nope.  Can't do it.  We cannot do that. 
[00:23:30]  It just doesn't work out.  Call him and tell him you can't do it for less than what you were making.  Yes, poopsie.  And there I am on the phone with Bruce Emitman.  Bruce, yeah, look great.  We had a great time.  But, look, I'm going to need a little more money for this.  I just can't move up.  I'd say, I'd say, and she's like right next to me.  She was the worst when it came to this.  She had no bargaining position there whatsoever.  So, Bruce, he brings it up, too. 
[00:24:00]  She had no clue of the upside.  It was either installing air conditioners or go into radio with the potential to make ridiculous money.  She just never saw it that way.  How many superstars?  Both men and women.  Just in a bad relationship.  People could, like, win an Oscar.  Yeah.  I like fucking, you know, seating people at, like, an Applebee's.  Yep.  Just because.  Yeah, just because.  No.  No.  You're not doing that part.  No.  You're not doing that.  We can't afford it.  Acting is silly.  Yeah.  And you're going to get a real job.  There's Grammy-winning singers and fucking people that are just talented up the ass. 
[00:24:30]  Working at Dunkin' Donuts.  Yep.  Eking it out.  Oh, my God.  No, I remember, like, when I was thinking about doing stand-up, I didn't have the balls to even think I could do, because I didn't know anybody in entertainment.  And you literally, I'm working in this warehouse, and I'm, you know, to just sit there and say, I want to be a comedian, I'm just thinking about trashing that I would get for you.  Right.  Take a fucking warehouse pallet over my head.  So I'm not going to say anything.  Hey, the guy wants to be a comedian.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Just go unload the truck, you douchebag.  Hey, funny man.  The only thing funny about you is the electric.  So it just so happened, I was working with this guy who was really into comedy.  One night we were hanging out after work.  Remember that show, Stand-Up Spotlight?  Yeah.  With Rosie O'Donnell.  Uh-huh.  It was right at the end of that 80s.  Was that the one with the brick wall?  That was the one that actually, no, this one actually had, like, the little Christmas lights in the background to be stars.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Because all these hacks were on their way, right? 
[00:25:30]  And we were just watching, and he just happened to say to me, he goes, look at these guys, Bill.  These guys suck.  We're funnier than these guys.  You know, one of these days I'm going to take a shot at Jack Daniels, and I'm going to fucking get up there.  And the second he said that, all of a sudden I was like, it just kind of put me on that track.  Like, fuck, I want to do that.  But I swear to God, if I never had that conversation with him.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd be, like, driving a fucking UPS truck.  Yeah.  For real.  I'm like the Kevin James character.  Yeah, for real.  Yeah, $700 million.  It's just, uh...  So how did we get to this point?  You get... 
[00:26:00]  I don't know.  Oh, but wait, wait, wait.  Quickly, Bruce came back to me and said, I could give you $27.5, but that's it.  And, uh, you know, I was like, I gotta take this.  So, boy, I really put my foot down there and said, yeah, $27.5.  And, uh, don't worry, it'll all work.  Opie said that more money will come in and everything.  So finally...  Was I right?  Was I right?  Of course you were right.  Thank you.  And then, uh, the real kicker, fast forward, uh, nine years later in court to have Dominic 
[00:26:30]  Barbara, uh, telling me how integral a part she played in me getting to where I am in  radio and how she deserves so much money.  Did they throw out the support word?  Oh, everything.  Yeah, yeah.  The support, the, uh, you know, uh, it pretty much was, if it wasn't for her, I would not  be in radio.  Meanwhile, you know, I almost didn't end up in radio.  Because she didn't see the, the dream, the vision.  Yeah, the vision.  That's, that's how it works out. 
[00:27:00]  That's the wonder of marriage.  At times, she was definitely a hindrance.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Because Anthony was miserable.  Oh.  Because he was getting yelled at.  Like, I can't stress, I mean, we were on a rocket ship.  We were going into the city to do this radio show that was exploding.  We were doing magazine articles.  We were going to be on TV doing this.  I mean, things were really rocking for us.  Yeah.  And, and he's getting yelled at because from nine to nine fifteen, he didn't like vacuum  and, and, uh.  Vacuuming was my job, too.  And clean out the litter box. 
[00:27:30]  Jesus Christ.  There was, uh, yeah.  You know, fast forward six hours later in that day and the world is ours.  But at home, it was a nightmare.  That kind of worked out for me, though, because when I was there at the station, it was such  a good time for me.  Like, I was away and having so much fun.  I never went home.  I swear to you.  I would, I would go, I would start drinking at noon.  Get back at noon.  We were talking about this last night because we went to the Rolling Stones. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  We'll get into that in a little while here.  But, uh, XM threw a whole party for their salespeople from all over the country.  Uh-huh.  So, I went because I, I wanted to check out the Stones.  You decided not to go last night.  Ben was there, Steve, Eric, and others.  And, uh, it was a schmooze fest.  Yeah.  And everyone's asking, where's Anthony?  Of course they are.  And, like, Anthony's home, whatever.  He doesn't do this type of thing anymore.  Whatever.  I actually had plans.  I wanted to go.  Right.  I was actually out last night.  But then, uh, we were, uh, we were telling Lindsay, actually, the old Anthony.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  About the old Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  Because she only knows the new Anthony.  I'm like, you have no idea.  The old Anthony would be at that bar.  Not only, not only drinking a beer, it would be a beer shot, beer shot, beer shot, beer shot, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, beer shot, beer shot, beer shot, beer shot, beer shot, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.  Yeah.  Like, he's a completely different person.  I liked my captains and Cokes.  That's what I really enjoyed.  And then other people started coming around, and Ben and I were explaining the old Anthony.  Like, Anthony would start, he wouldn't drink the first hour of the show.  Like, from three to four, he wouldn't drink. 
[00:29:00]  But from four to seven in the afternoon, forget about it.  Pounding.  Pounding beers.  The beer sponsors would send over pallets of beer to the studio.  They set us up with refrigerators just outside the studio that were packed with beer.  Sam Adams, Budweiser, Coors, all of them came on board, and all of them sent beer.  Dude, we were a radio company's dream.  We had every beer company wanted on our show.  Yeah.  And we used to have two fridges.  We had a fridge for food and a fridge for beer. 
[00:29:30]  And then the fridge for food got filled up with beer as well.  So now we had two fridges with beer in them.  Then the other companies would start bringing their own fridges in because they noticed.  Like, Sobe beverages brought in this big double door thing you see in a deli, you know, where you open it up and pull your sodas out and stuff.  It was giant.  That thing ended up full of beer.  Full of beer.  And then the beer guys would come in with almost a pallet of beer, like small, you know, a pallet's an exaggeration, but a lot of beer.  And they would come right into our office where you guys want this. 
[00:30:00]  And they would notice that they couldn't keep their beer cold, which means we might not drink it on the air, which means we might not give the extra push to that beer.  Yeah.  So they would bring it in their own fridges.  At the end, I think we had four fridges in the office.  We would get 12 cases of Budweiser one week, 12 cases of Sam the next week, then Coors was like six cases.  So it was ridiculous.  Sounds like the Motley Crue, like the beginning of their behind the music.  It absolutely is.  We have a lot of interest in a book, and I think we're finally going to go down that road.  Oh, yeah.  And then the Jaegermeister machine showed up. 
[00:30:30]  Jaeger.  We were talking about Jaeger, and the people from Jaegermeister come up, and they bring one of those machines that deep freezes shots of Jaegermeister.  It's a big refrigerator.  So you hit the tap, put the shock glass underneath, and you get a shot of Jaeger that's at like 33 degrees.  Just above freezing.  So now we're doing frozen Jaeger shots.  This is while we're working.  This was on the air.  Nobody stepped in in upper management like, hey.  No, they were afraid of us. 
[00:31:00]  No, why, the ratings were going up, up, up, up, so they were just keeping their mouths shut.  It's like whatever.  Here's what the deal was.  The rest of the station was tanking so badly that we were the only show that was keeping these people their jobs.  Like you can't be the general manager, program director of a station that's consistently in the shitter.  They blow you out and bring someone else in and try to get it up to speed.  Look at what they've done at N.E.W. since we were gone.  They've been through so many people there, so many bosses, because that's what you do.  So they knew that without our ratings, their jobs were done. 
[00:31:30]  So they were petrified to shake us up or rock the boat.  We hired a bartender.  We hired a bartender to come in.  We had shot girls.  We had girls with the test tubes and the shots walking around on Fridays.  And the boss is there.  Hey, guys, how are you doing?  It got to the point.  There were so many people around when we were doing our show, we didn't know half of them.  It was a bullet train heading toward a concrete wall. 
[00:32:00]  They were drinking our beer, doing our shots.  We didn't care.  We just didn't care.  Anthony, how many beers a day were you drinking?  Let's see.  We'd start an hour after the show started.  Me and Ben.  Four to seven.  We'd start drinking.  By seven o'clock, I'd probably finished off about eight beers.  And then we'd hit the office, because I didn't want to go home.  We'd hit the office where I would play video games, drink more.  And then the second Opie left the office, it would turn into a fog machine. 
[00:32:30]  The whole me, stinky, everyone would light up and just smoke beers, shots, and computer games  until ten o'clock at night when I would finally call up and go,  yeah, all the meetings are over.  I'm coming home.  And then I'd get in my car.  Finished all that paperwork.  And just depression would sink in as I was on the LIE going,  oh, no, I'm heading home.  Oh, no.  Oh, fuck.  This is, oh, boy.  This is day in and day out.  And then I'd get home, the garbage is full, the this, the that, the cat box. 
[00:33:00]  Go up and feed the cats.  You would do Ron and Fez's show, too, because of that.  Oh, right.  Ron and Fez come on after us.  And I would just sit in on their show.  I would be like, hey, I'm going to hang out.  And it was the Ron, Fez, and Anthony show.  He was the third member of the Ron and Fez show.  And then back then they were on 11 o'clock at night in the beginning.  Yeah.  They did it before they moved to 7 to 11.  So yesterday, being at the Rolling Stones thing, it was kind of funny that Anthony wasn't there. 
[00:33:30]  And, you know, we joke about how he just goes home after the show and doesn't do much anymore  because it's not the same Anthony we know.  That's right.  So I don't know where, I don't know how we got to this point.  I think it was the Renee Zellweger marriage thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Somehow that spilled into this.  Anytime anyone talks about marriage, I just get it in my head.  It's like, never again.  Yeah, but you know what's funny about that is if you actually told that on TV, you would be considered, like, women bashing. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Because I was sitting there listening to that.  That was why that was so fascinating to listen to that story because you always hear the other ones.  Yeah.  Like the women going, and then he beat me, and then he did this, and blah, blah, blah, blah.  I was a prisoner.  Yeah, and Oprah and all of them, for hours, will listen to that because they're just like, just obviously you see a man is stronger than a woman, so it just seems to make sense.  They don't put any weight on, like, a woman's, like, that psychological ability of them to mindfuck you.  Yeah, that's all it was.  I was just always on coast. 
[00:34:30]  I'm not saying that they all do that, but I'm saying the story you have, a lot of people have, but they never.  Yeah, it depends how far he wants to go with this, man.  He's got a million great stories.  I was just always on coast.  That was my whole life back then was just, all right, don't shake things up.  Let me just coast through this.  That's hilarious because you had the exact opposite relation.  My mother and father, my dad used to always be cursing at my mother.  We used to be going down to the bus stop, me and my two other brothers.  I'd be, like, first grade, first grade, third, and kindergarten.  We'd be standing down there.  We didn't have any air conditioner.  The windows would be open, and my dad would just be cursing at my mother. 
[00:35:00]  We're, like, 20 feet away at the bus stop.  Oh, you goddamn fucking bitch.  You've been doing the same shit for years.  Oh, that's bullshit, Linda.  That is fucking bullshit.  And we're, like, sitting down there because it's, like, jump ropes, like, looking at his stuff.  We're trying to play it off, like, hey, I wonder what else that's coming from.  The drapes are blowing out the window.  He's yelling so loud.  Maybe it is the upbringing.  It's the exact opposite.  See, my father was that way, too. 
[00:35:30]  My father was always, you know, he was a real prick just yelling all the time.  Motherfucker, this.  I remember, and I've told the story on the air, the vivid memory as a child is an argument during dinner  where his plate of spaghetti and meatballs was just launched against the wall.  Like, he picked it up and threw it, and then they just start yelling at each other.  And I'm a little kid sitting there looking at the spaghetti sauce just sliding slowly down the old wall  with the bell telephone next to it on the wall. 
[00:36:00]  And just, like, it was this horrifying moment as a child.  Maybe, you know, I grew up and decided I'm never going to argue back.  I'll just be this guy.  Like, yes, poochie, yes, dear.  We'll play that going into break because that's a great, great production piece.  Just to avoid confrontation.  That was me.  Wow.  Avoid confrontation, guy.  I had the same shit.  Let's go to Kevin in Minnesota.  Kevin.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, man.  What's up, Jimmy's replacement?  It's Bill Burr, everyone.  We haven't introduced Bill today.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  It's Bill Burr. 
[00:36:30]  Let me give you one thing about Bill Burr.  His half-hour comedy special is on HBO Tonight at Midnight.  I'm hearing really good things about Bill Burr's comedy special.  Yeah, it's called Jimmy's replacement, one-night stand on HBO.  Check it out tonight at Midnight on HBO, and then it's going to run a bunch after that, I'm sure.  And Bill getting raves for his job yesterday, sitting in.  Awesome.  Absolutely.  I read a lot.  And getting rave reviews.  Very good.  Kevin, what do you have for the show?  Well, I was kind of wondering what your ex-old lady, which kind of sounds like a bitch, personally, 
[00:37:00]  but what did she do while you were at work earning an income, while she was sitting there stroking her five pussies?  Well, let me tell you, up in Ashland, Mass., she did work.  She was, I guess, she worked at a Papageno's when we first got there.  And then, um...  It depends how far he wants to go with this.  See, I didn't realize she had such a huge leg to stand on.  Well, that was, you know, bringing in the Papageno's money. 
[00:37:30]  And then there was...  This is, while we were becoming, I've got to say it again, rock and roll radio stars.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  And then, the job, uh, she got the job at the liquor store, which, uh, oof, wow.  Like putting a pedophile in charge of a nursery.  That was, uh...  Wowie kazowie.  But at least she drove herself to work, so that was a good thing.  No, no.  At least she didn't have to worry about that.  Well, that would have been a good thing.  She never got a license. 
[00:38:00]  She never got a license to drive.  Yeah.  So, what, what I had to deal with was driving her everywhere.  Everywhere she had to go, I had to drive.  She's just bitching the whole, the whole time.  So, it was, there was a lot of that, yes.  A lot of the, the, the arguments.  And, and, uh, I would drive her to work and then have to drive me to work.  And then she would get off of work before I did, because I worked till seven.  When she'd get off of work, what she would do is grab one of those, uh, boxes of wine 
[00:38:30]  and, uh, bring it to her mom's house, which was less than a half mile from the liquor store.  Now, I would have to, instead of just getting done with my day and driving home,  having my slippers and pipe waiting for me, I would have to drive to the mother's house.  Which was kind of far.  It was, it wasn't that far, but it was out of the way.  I had to pass my house.  It was far enough to be a hassle after a while.  I had to pass my house in order to get to her house, which I didn't want to do after work.  It's seven o'clock at night. 
[00:39:00]  I just wanted to, you know, go home, wind up, or maybe stop at Green Acres over there  in Ashland and down a few drinks or something like that.  But I had to go to the mother's house, where they would both sit now, uh, and it wasn't  a immediately leave thing.  Now I had to sit in the basement with her and her mother as they watched, uh, videos of that  day's general hospital, uh, days of our lives and friends.  So now I'm sitting on the couch.  Oh my God. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Until 10, from seven to like 10.  I'm just picturing your whole posture, like your head down, shoulder slumped.  Dude.  It was a nightmare.  And this was every night.  So then it would be like 10 o'clock.  Uh, I, I caught up on general hospital and days of our lives and friends.  And, uh, they would just get sauced on the wine, the box of wine.  And, uh, I would get tanked on my, uh, Jack and, uh, Coke or, or Captain Morgan and Coke. 
[00:40:00]  And then, uh, hop in the car and drive.  So what would you do?  Were you, Obie, were you trying to be like the, the friend here going?  He lived it.  Gently nudge him to like, dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?  I, uh, I was just the friend that dragged him out of there.  I don't know.  We had fun at work and stuff.  At work.  Like I said, work was such a pisser and I don't even think he, he knew what was going  on because, you know, we'd go out, uh, the, our outings were just classic when we would  go.  Yeah.  Like it would be, oh, we'd go, hey, Ant, let's go to, um, uh, what was that place called? 
[00:40:30]  Mother Anna's.  Mother Anna's.  Sure.  In the North End.  They'd go, hey, let's go to Mother Anna's, uh, for dinner tonight.  All right.  Uh, Jen, we're going to, uh, Mother Anna's with, uh, Opie, Sandy and, uh, Jay from Framingham.  All right.  Oh, mom wants to go.  What?  What?  Mom wants to go.  Yeah, but it's just kind of an us guy thing.  His mother-in-law had to go.  Hanging out thing.  Yeah, but we just.  But we want to have fun.  But we just want to have fun.  She had to go pretty much everywhere we went. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  She was cool to a point, but.  But they, but they really enjoyed the drinking.  So it kind of got a little, we'd all be in the middle of like having a good time and  her mother would out of nowhere just go, I want to go home.  And, and we'd be like.  Right.  It's the strippers coming out of the cake.  Go out the candles for a second.  I want to go home.  So now, you know, we're in Boston and she lives in, in Ashland. 
[00:41:30]  And so now I got a far drive.  I got to hop in the car and drive back to Ashland.  Right when it was getting good.  Right when, like we were hanging.  It's getting fun.  And we're all buzzed.  And now the comedy is really flowing.  We're all laughing our asses off.  Unbelievable.  That's a little.  And that God rest her soul, by the way, for those of you that don't know, Judy passed  in a few months ago.  And, you know, she was fun.  She was a lot of fun.  I mean, she was definitely a pisser.  But, you know, as a mother-in-law type thing. 
[00:42:00]  Judy's now with Chester.  That's right.  And she always wanted that.  So.  Yeah.  Rest in peace.  But it was, it was a hell of a lifestyle I was leading there.  During the radio show, during our appearances out, it was just a friggin' nightmare.  We would, oh my God.  Remember the Kahlua girls and things.  We're doing shots and girls are inviting us to go skinny dipping.  These Kahlua girls.  You ever see these liquor girls, promo girls? 
[00:42:30]  They walk around like the Budweiser girls.  The Budweiser girls.  And the Kahlua girls were dressed in like these little tight skirts and stuff.  And they're like, yeah, why?  We're all getting hammered together.  We're both.  We're getting paid like, I guess, a hundred bucks a night to be there.  We were both assholes because we were both in shaky relationships, to say the least.  But we're good guys.  Good guys.  And we're doing this appearance and we're like becoming rock stars.  And these young Kahlua girls are just hammered.  And we're doing shots with them.  And all of a sudden they're like, you guys want to go skinny dipping? 
[00:43:00]  This one Kahlua girl comes up to me.  She comes up to me and she's got pigtails and braces.  And she goes, I really like you.  And she's like grabbing me.  And she goes, we're all going skinny dipping at the lake because we're really close to the lake.  And I want you to come with me.  I've got to go home to the cats and the garbage and the vacuum and the box of wine and friends and general hospital. 
[00:43:30]  No, I can't go skinny dipping with you.  We were the worst.  We would end up driving home pretty much crying to each other.  Oh, I'd be steering with my rod.  Yeah, that was a great gig, Opie.  We're like, do you realize what we just said no to?  Oh, how many times I wanted to throw that in her face during one of those things.  It's like, why don't you take the coffee?  Do you know what I'm offered?  Do you know what I'm offered when we do those fucking bar gigs? 
[00:44:00]  I could be fucking a girl with pigtails and braces.  A Yager girl.  That's old enough to drink.  Barely.  Yeah.  That's funny, the spaghetti thing.  My mother one time, my dad was, she just finally couldn't take it anymore.  She was feeding my baby a bowl of Apple Jacks.  And she finally just took this.  I don't remember the food.  Throw the bowl.  Just went like this in the milk and the Apple Jacks.  Went flying.  My dad has like a cowlick, too, in the front, so it's perfect. 
[00:44:30]  Glanced off his head.  It looked like the Kennedy assassination.  Glanced off his head and just sprayed across the wall behind it, dude.  It was great.  There was all this milk and Apple Jacks.  And it was fucking silence.  Like, oh my God, she finally fought back.  And my dad didn't know what to do.  He's got like cereal in the front of his fucking hair.  And he just walked out.  And all of us were going like, that's what you got to do, Mom.  Anytime he does it, you just take a bowl of cereal, you fucking throw it in his face.  Oh, is that funny? 
[00:45:00]  Did it maintain its bowl-like shape for a few seconds?  Oh, yeah.  Before it struck him.  Oh, it was great.  Like slow motion, you could kind of see it coming.  God, that is fantastic.  Back and to the left.  Oh, that is great.  But then, of course, the relationship after that, like within 10 seconds, she's cleaning  it up, washing the wall, and then it goes right back to everything.  Where it's supposed to be.  Yeah.  Got thrown out of whack for a second.  Yeah.  Oh, that is great.  He gains his footing with his milk-soaked hair.  He probably knew he couldn't fight back, because you can't be very tough with Apple Jacks and 
[00:45:30]  your hair and the milk.  Let's go to Michigan and say hi to John.  John, what's going on?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, I wanted to ask Anthony, his wife took all his money out of the bank and they got a  divorce.  Whatever she'd go on to do, did she ever go on and get married or anything like that?  Is he in spite of her?  No, I don't know much of anything she's doing.  I do know that the money that I've earned doing radio has bought her a house. 
[00:46:00]  I know she has a house.  And she finally got her driver's license, and so she's doing it.  Oh, did she?  No.  Oh, you don't know?  No, that was a joke.  Oh.  She didn't.  Yeah.  I was going to say, she didn't care what she did.  I don't have to buy the car.  No, because after...  Good.  Well, then she was just taking public transportation and stuff and buses.  Yeah.  Well, there was something that went on, like, when she was a teen or something.  She got in a car and went to drive it and, like, came out of a parking lot and went right 
[00:46:30]  into a tree.  So, like, ever since then, she just figured she wouldn't get a license, so I had to drive  her everywhere.  Nightmare.  All right, we should take a break.  Wow.  That was therapeutic.  Yes.  That was weird.  That's not how we were going to start the show.  That's why you've got to listen to the show every day.  You never know.  We don't even know what we're doing on a daily basis.  You think that was written on one of these papers that are in front of us?  Of course not.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bill Burr sitting in for Jim Norton once again today. 
[00:47:00]  Very funny guy.  He's got his half-hour comedy special tonight on HBO at midnight.  Make sure you check it out.  All right, I guess we'll break and we'll figure out what we do next.  How's that?  Sure.  A little Stephen Lynch song, because it's appropriate, and then the War of the Cummius thing  that Steve put together.  We've got a lot more comedy right here, so stay there.  Hush, little girl, sweet baby, don't cry tonight. 
[00:47:30]  Daddy is here, and he'll sing you a song, lullaby tonight.  Why can't it all be like it was before?  How can I explain why Mommy's not here anymore? 
[00:48:00]  Because Daddy likes porno and ten-dollar whores.  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores.  Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus.  I think that's why your mommy left down.  Hush, little girl. 
[00:48:30]  There is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke.  Daddy just wants to forget.  Tonight.  Soon it will all be like it was before.  Any minute she will walk through that front door. 
[00:49:00]  But Daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer.  And then he wants sex that involves Mommy's rear.  Daddy has sores on his naughty parts.  Losing with pus.  I think that's why your mommy left.  Please don't cry. 
[00:49:30]  I swear I'll try.  To be here by your side.  Right after Daddy gets home from the bar.  He visits his bookie and steals a new car.  He'll drive to the strip club.  And if Daddy plays his cards right. 
[00:50:00]  He'll bring home your new mommy tonight.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da-da.  Dee-da-da-dee-da.  La-dee-da-da-da-da-da-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da- 
[00:50:30]  They're horrified watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Get the fuck out of the wall, fuck you.  Oh, the horrified kids.  Did Dad actually leave after the fights? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep because the yelling would stop.  First, Mom would have to wind down a little.  You know, even after Dad left, she's still going.  I'm trying to sleep. He's gone.  Shut up. Shut up.  Oh, God, he's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back? The next day?  Yeah, like the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down watching like Ronan Martin's laughing, laughing.  Everything was fine, you know, and then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling. 
[00:51:30]  You'd be in bed and you'd be like,  And then you'd hear from the kids.  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for like one night?  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, we got, you know, called into the room and Mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know, and I want you to know it has nothing to do with you, we're divorced.  Oh, okay. 
[00:52:00]  Could I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one like five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole.  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming.  That way!  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp. 
[00:52:30]  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Cuyas.  You've got to figure you're going to just sit there disgusted having to listen to this crap.  Ah, you're checking out the O.B. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The Rolling Stones.  We all went to the Rolling Stones show last night at the Meadowlands.  We've got to get Ben in here and Martini Steve. 
[00:53:00]  There's a little problem.  I guess we should get into it.  Eric is very, very pissed off this morning.  I'm extremely pissed off.  Hey, quickly, Jacob from Jersey is wondering if right when the divorce papers were assigned,  if I screamed,  FREEDOM!  After my guts were taken out.  That was a happy day for you.  Yeah.  It was a very happy day.  It certainly was.  So, most of the gang today, very sluggish.  Anthony went home and took it easy. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  We all went down to the Meadowlands for the Rolling Stones show.  And we had to be there at, like, five because we did, like, a VIP party for XM.  They flew in salespeople from all over the country.  Supposedly, they're all showing up here today.  Yeah.  Right.  I don't think that's happening.  These guys like to drink, man.  Holy...  Oh, man!  Hey, Steve!  Steve!  Hi, fellas.  What's up, Steve?  How are you?  All I know is, uh...  Never gets old.  No.  Will and the gang got hammered, but they promised they were going to bring a busload of some of 
[00:54:00]  these XM people from around the country over here today to check out the show, because  they're all big fans of the show, yeah.  Will will definitely make it.  He's a trooper.  Yeah, he will.  And hopefully the attractive sales girl will come by, who's got some fans here already.  Oh, really?  Yeah, maybe Will can tell some of those stories that he was telling us last night.  But, uh...  Sounds like a good time was had by all.  Great time.  Well, maybe not all, but... 
[00:54:30]  It was an unbelievable time.  Alanis Morissette warmed up, but no one saw her perform.  No one cared.  No one cares about the opening gig anymore?  Well, they have great acts on other parts of the tour.  Metallica's opening, the White Stripes, Pearl Jam...  Why couldn't we get Metallica?  Wow, you didn't get...  Yeah.  Black Stones, Metallica's doing their hometown gig in San Francisco.  You get Alanis Morissette.  Out of all the bands that have come out of Jersey and New York, you know, why couldn't  they get one of the, like, Bon Jovi or somebody just to step up and say, yeah, what the hell, 
[00:55:00]  we'll warm up for you guys.  And you've got to respect that you're in your 60s and you're not scared to follow Metallica.  That's pretty impressive.  They've got nothing to worry about.  The Stones still play great.  Let me tell you something.  I love Metallica, but James Hetfield as a front man compared to Mick Jagger, you can't  even compare the two.  Can't even compare the two.  It's two different things.  Last time I saw Metallica...  Come on.  Oh, it was when we saw Metallica.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, with Jim.  James Hetfield, he just seemed like not attached to the audience, you know?  He sounded great and all that, but when it came to, you know, to just, I don't know, 
[00:55:30]  talking to the crowd and all that, he just seemed kind of distant.  He's never been a work-the-crowd kind of guy to stand there and, yeah, he's got an insert  city name here monologue that he does.  Yeah, right.  So Alanis Morissette, I guess, went on.  I don't know.  I didn't see her.  No one did.  I mean, there was like ten people in the crowd.  No joke, man.  Oh, wow.  They were just starting to file in when she started.  And then this is the new thing at concerts.  Then it's the hour break.  An hour. 
[00:56:00]  An hour between Alanis Morissette and then when the Stones finally hit the stage.  Not like that in the old days.  Because you've got to drink up, man.  Yeah.  Got to drink up.  Got to get your beers in.  They pretty much just changed the equipment over and then the act would come on, the headliner.  Remember, it used to be like a pit crew when we were growing up.  Yeah.  One band would get off and the other band would just be pushing the drum sets right off the  back of the stage.  The opening band would get jabbed.  They'd have the headline band's equipment all set up covered with sheets. 
[00:56:30]  And then the opening band would have a little spot front stage.  And they'd get done and then the headliner would come on.  Being dwarfed by the drum kit of the headlining.  Huge drum kit and then there's this little freaking drum set.  Well, you can't cover up the Rolling Stones stage.  Oh, my God.  It was like ten stories high or something.  Did they have all the walkways and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That guy runs around like a maniac still.  Well, that's what I was going to say.  Last time I saw the Stones was 1989.  And I'm thinking, come on, they must have lost something since 1989. 
[00:57:00]  The new CD's getting really good reviews and stuff.  And it went last night.  I was blown away.  Mick Jagger's what, 62?  62.  He's 62 years old running around like he's in his 30s.  No problem.  Wow.  The whole time.  He's just ripped.  He's cut.  He knows he's cut, too, because a few songs he's pulling up his shirt like he's hot, but  he's leaving it up so the girls can check out his ab work.  And he's in his 60s. 
[00:57:30]  God damn.  And there was like at least three generations in the audience.  At least.  Yeah.  I mean, there were women walking around and you're like, wow, that's a grandma.  There's no mistaking.  That woman is a grandma.  To the Rolling Stones, we're out of the rough.  All the way down to girls in their early 20s.  You know, it was the whole gamut, man.  Did you have to listen to people's awful stories around you?  I saw them in 1972.  I blew the original rhythm guitarist at the Fillmore. 
[00:58:00]  Back when I had tea.  But completely blown away, man.  Completely.  It was just a great show.  An absolute great show.  And I noticed that.  Did anyone else notice the planes were flying over all night long?  Yeah, planes were going right overhead.  I mean, right through, you know, the top of the, whatever, above, obviously.  But right, split in the stadium.  And you can almost feel what the pilot was saying to, you know, the people on board.  You know, the Rolling Stones are, you know, playing right now. 
[00:58:30]  If you want to look below.  Look to your left.  Oh, yeah.  Because these things are going right over the stadium, man.  One after another.  One, I mean, every single one.  Every minute it was another plane flying right overhead.  Yeah, they did the same thing when the Who was playing over there years ago.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's kind of annoying, though.  Right.  When he'd listen to a song and...  Mick Jagger's such a showman.  I think he knew that was going on because he was kind of pointing up to the planes a few times.  Almost like, I know they're probably, you know, telling the people to look down at this point.  So he's looking up. 
[00:59:00]  I'm going to suck.  You've got the middle seat on your way to, like, Seattle.  Yeah.  Six hours.  If you look down, there's 60,000 people having the time of their life.  He's just leaning over to Keith, pointing at the plane and going, I could buy that.  Charlie Watts looked like he's not going to make it.  Yeah.  He's just tapping away on his drums.  Then he had the big casino.  He did, right?  He did.  He beat it.  He beat the big casino, Tony.  He beat the big casino.  He hit throat cancer.  Yeah, he beat it.  Wow.  And Keith Richards still plays great.  Yeah.  How's he looking, these days? 
[00:59:30]  Like an alien.  He looks like an alien with a wig, basically.  And Ron Wood just looks like a gay guy.  He's wearing girl shirts and stuff.  Like an old queen?  I don't know what his deal is.  I have no clue.  Do you know?  No, he's marrying his kids.  Holy crap, man.  He was wearing, like, you know, girls.  What's that one story?  Express or Express?  Wasn't it him that his son was going out with the dog?  No, that was Bill Wyman.  That was Bill Wyman.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I was wondering who it was.  His son was going out with the mother of the daughter that Bill Wyman was fucking. 
[01:00:00]  It was just some kind of sordid, horrific story.  Well, Bill Wyman, I mean, he started dating that girl when she was, like, 12 or something.  Some ridiculous thing.  And then he married her.  And then they were divorced only two years.  Yeah.  He trades him in at, like, 19.  He decided he didn't need to do the Stones thing anymore.  That's right.  It was a Kahlua girl with braces and pigtails.  But it wasn't like seeing, you know, Kiss at the end of their career, where it was like,  it was almost like kind of a goof to me to see Kiss. 
[01:00:30]  The Rolling Stones are still making it happen.  And then the stage just kind of lifted up.  And they moved the stage completely to the middle of Giant Stadium and did four songs out there.  That's something the mechanics behind stage shows these days.  That was pretty cool.  And as it's slowly moving, the crowd is just losing their minds.  Half of the parking lot is tractor trailers to haul this massive set around.  It's amazing.  You just don't get an idea of how massive this thing is just when you hit the parking lot  and you see, you know, just the whole perimeter of the first layer of parking spaces is all semis. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Because the stage that is as high as Giant Stadium is and as wide as, what is it, like the first?  It weighs 150 tons.  It's the biggest stage ever constructed in rock and roll.  Steve is actually able to land in his seat.  He bypassed the parking lot completely and landed his car right in his own seat.  No parking problems for Steve.  They weren't.  But anyway, Eric is very pissed off. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, now Eric is pissed.  You would think, when I heard, because right when I walked in, I think it was Ben said,  Eric is really pissed.  So I go, okay, the $100,000 thing was a scam.  Right.  Turns out, no.  The $100,000 thing is not a scam.  Turns out Eric had one of the best days of his life and one of the worst days of his life, all in the same day.  So I'm thinking, start out great, ended really, really bad.  You win $100,000.  Well, all right, let's quickly cover that. 
[01:02:00]  Was it the Post or the Daily News?  Daily News.  You better know.  The Daily News had a contest in their paper a few months back.  You might remember this because it made the national news.  It's some kind of, what was the game called?  Do you remember?  Scratch and Match.  Scratch and Match.  They're still doing it on the front page of the Daily News today.  Yeah, there's a new one coming out on Sunday.  It says all new Scratch and Match.  So what you would do is scratch some numbers off.  If they match the numbers, corresponding numbers, by some money values, like a lottery ticket, you win that amount. 
[01:02:30]  There was a misprint on these Scratch and Match tickets.  So a shitload of people across New York that bought the paper scratched the number and realized,  holy shit, I won $100,000.  And they were only supposed to have maybe four or five winners, right?  Total, yeah.  Total.  Out of the whole contest.  But instead there were hundreds because of the misprint.  Hundreds of winners because they misprinted one of the numbers.  So their solution to this whole thing was, okay, write your name, address, all this crap, send it in,  and we'll have a drawing out of all the people. 
[01:03:00]  This was after a lot of people lost their shit, protesting.  They all wanted their money.  Well, we saw it on the news, and every story sounded like,  I had plans for that money already.  I already spent it.  I spent it.  The Daily News, they can't take people's dreams and step alone.  Like they were entitled.  And it was, I'm sorry, I don't know why.  It was all black people that were protesting.  Reverend Al came out for them against the Daily News. 
[01:03:30]  Celine Dion.  Celine.  Why buy these people?  At least buy them a kayak.  Let them touch the people.  Let them touch the money.  They could break through the wall, get the money from the Daily News.  Awful woman.  And they figured they would take all the people that thought they won.  Hundreds of people.  Put them in a drawing.  Right.  And pick the money out of the proverbial hat. 
[01:04:00]  And whoever won gets 100 grand.  How many total winners out of the pick out of the hat did they have?  Five.  Five total winners.  Out of, I mean, I don't know how many people were in it.  Do you?  Do you know how many people entered?  It was a lot of pissed off people that thought they won 100 grand and entered.  Five people are picked out of this hat that win $100,000.  Do you know who one of those people were?  Our own hawk.  Hawk.  Eric Nagel was the winner of $100,000. 
[01:04:30]  He won $100,000 yesterday.  From the Daily News.  Late in the show, Ben busted into the studio.  Lily White, Eric Nagel.  I want to know what the other four people are.  I want to know if they're white.  Because I am going to say that it is racially motivated.  So he won $100,000.  Eric's saying, shut up until I get my check, asshole.  He gets it today.  He gets it today.  Is it a big, giant one?  No, they don't do that.  Where are they presenting it?  It's being certified.  It's coming to my house. 
[01:05:00]  Going to your house?  Yeah.  Where do you live?  Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Well, last night he lived at the station, I think.  We'll get into that in a second.  Yeah, because now I thought when I heard that he was pissed off, I assumed that it was a  scam and he didn't win the $100,000.  And I thought he was pissed at that.  It turns out the Daily News came by, took a nice picture of Eric and probably the other  winners, wherever they live or work.  Where did they take the picture?  Right here in the studio.  In front of the ONA, son. 
[01:05:30]  In front of the ONA, son, you motherfucker.  You're great.  A little promotion, too.  That's good.  And did they do a little quick interview with you about who you are and what you're doing?  No, there was no interview.  They just had the names and they just needed photos.  That was it.  They're doing some big thing on Sunday's paper.  Usually, Eric, who works at blah, blah, blah.  That will be mentioned, yeah.  That will be mentioned.  That will be mentioned, Eric, from the Opie and Anthony show.  Very good.  I think the picture's going to be in Sunday's Daily News.  Sunday's Daily News.  Everyone picks that one up. 
[01:06:00]  We've got to call David Hinckley.  David Hinckley would write about this.  Yeah, he'd write about it.  One of our guys wins $100,000.  Mm-hmm.  So that's how his day started.  And then he went to the Rolling Stones with us and he was left behind.  And he's really mad at everyone, but I could easily defend myself.  From the story I heard, you guys ditched him is what I'm getting.  We didn't ditch you.  In one of the most obscure places in the tri-state area.  The Meadowlands. 
[01:06:30]  Here's the deal.  Well, I drove to the Stones show.  You drove?  Yeah.  Your own vehicle?  It was Lindsay and I, Ben, and Eric.  Mm-hmm.  And we did the XM thing, meet and greet, blah, blah, blah.  Everyone's drinking, having a good time, eating New York D'oeuvres,  blowing off Alanis Morissette.  And it's time to go to our seats.  And we have seats all over the place.  First of all, I had no idea you weren't sitting in our section.  I had no idea either.  When you guys were going in that area where you had those colored bracelets, 
[01:07:00]  they looked at my ticket and said,  No, you're going this way.  And you guys were already weighed down, so I couldn't even say anything.  Well, I'm going to start with that.  No, you knew.  You knew because you told me before.  I said, I have a side seat.  You guys have the floor.  Yes.  And they said, but we're all going this way.  They turned me around.  Look at all the bracelets we had to wear yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  I actually had a fourth one, too.  There was a fourth one that I had.  Because you had one for the party and one for the floor.  Cops everywhere.  The security was insane.  Eric had like one.  Huh?  You just had like one bracelet. 
[01:07:30]  Well, this is...  Sit in the back, stupid, written on the side.  Wow.  Oh, I had a really good seat.  This just in from Yahoo Finance.  They found out Eric won 100 grand.  Hellman's stock up two points.  Very good.  I thought you were going to pick another product.  Of course not.  Very good, Anthony.  So, we were leaving the party.  Here's the first mistake you made, Eric. 
[01:08:00]  And we'll let you, you know, try to defend yourself here.  We all went in the elevator together.  Yeah.  Didn't we?  Yes.  What happened to you?  Is this when you got there?  No, after the party, we were way up in the box.  Luxury box.  Way above the stadium, partying and stuff.  Of course you were.  And then there was about 100 of us from XM.  We all took the elevators.  These massive elevators.  You know, I don't know.  We had to take like two elevators.  But Eric was in the elevator with all of us.  We're going down to now find our seats on the floor. 
[01:08:30]  Little did we know he wasn't on the floor.  I did not know that, okay?  And we started walking from the elevator toward our seats.  We stopped to wait for you for at least five to ten minutes.  At least.  When we got off the elevator and we left, as we were going around the side, that lady,  that little old lady who was checking the tickets, she says, no, you can't go this way.  Oh, boy.  And I said, why?  And he goes, because you don't have that little band, that little, um...  One of these...  Oh, the wristband guy. 
[01:09:00]  And I go, are you kidding me?  I said, I know we're not sitting together, but they told me we're all going into the same area.  No, you can't go in there.  You've got to go all the way around the other way.  And when I turn around...  Wait, we have audio of you talking to the woman.  Liar, whore, liar, whore, and you know it.  Now, maybe she was pissed because you were yelling at her.  Shut your goddamn piehole!  So you weren't on the floor?  No.  Okay.  So that's what happened, Ben.  Yeah, they wouldn't let me follow you.  We waited for ten or fifteen minutes. 
[01:09:30]  Like, where is he?  So why wouldn't you call us at that time and say that, look, guys, I thought I was on the floor and I'm not on the floor?  Because that's the biggest problem here, first of all.  All right, well, when we got the tickets and I looked at it, I said to Ben, oh, I didn't get the bracelet  because I had the side stage and everybody else, I checked with Steve and everybody else had floor seats.  So pretty much everyone knew I wasn't sitting with you guys.  Uh-huh.  I had no idea, to be honest with you.  So, but you didn't call anyone.  Because you already knew.  Uh-oh. 
[01:10:00]  You had a cell phone.  You got cell phone.  Everyone's in constant communication.  We got cell phones and BlackBerry.  All right, well, at that point, when I wasn't allowed to continue past that barrier where everybody else was gone  and they were already down, I turned around and went the direction that they told me to.  See, at that point, I would have called Ben, Steve, myself, and said, hey, I thought I was with you guys.  I'm not.  I just want to let you know that.  It's definite I couldn't follow you guys.  Yeah, instead of being let off to slaughter.  Because that was the last time.  Well, seriously, that was the last time I saw him.  That was the last time I saw him.  But we had this plan that we were going to leave early, right? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Because it's Giant Stadium.  It's a nightmare to leave a concert or a football game, for that matter, and get back into the city.  It's a nightmare.  Yeah.  And we have to do the radio show.  So I was thinking, stupid me, I don't want to be out until 1.30 in the morning because I'm stuck in, you know, crazy traffic.  So you ditched him.  Well, no, I didn't ditch him.  Now, originally.  Hold on.  Here's the deal.  He didn't call you to tell you where he was and needing the ride.  Did you bother calling him and saying, Eric, where are you? 
[01:11:00]  Ben called a few times.  Ben called twice as we were leaving the stadium.  I got one message from Ben, and all I heard was the Rolling Stones and what sounded something like Ben, because I couldn't hear his voice at all on there.  Who do you think it was?  It had to be one of us.  Jumping jack, flat.  Ah, don't, don't.  Where are you?  You couldn't hear his voice.  Well, we had two plans.  We had two plans.  The plan was to leave after Sympathy for the Devil or 10.30.  Don't show the list, because I'm going to ask him a couple of very tough questions here. 
[01:11:30]  Uh-oh.  Very tough questions.  But the man says immediately.  So, logically, that makes sense.  Leave the concert early.  We've got to beat that out of there.  Of course.  So we're not stuck for an hour, hour and a half.  I never stay for the encore.  Okay?  Yeah.  So, I said that we would start thinking about leaving around 10.30, right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Did we also say that we would start leaving after Sympathy for the Devil?  Because Ben kind of knew the set list.  I believe so, yeah.  All right.  So, so far, two for two, okay?  So, where were you at 10.30 or after Sympathy for the Devil?  Between gate C and B in the parking lot. 
[01:12:00]  Because I didn't know exactly where you had parked, but it was right near that gate where  we came in.  So, I stood right there looking and waiting.  So, you were definitely out of the stadium at 10.30?  I was definitely out there, yes.  Okay.  So far, so good.  That's one for the defense, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, Bill and Anthony, you could decide who's wrong, okay?  I see Eric right now, though.  I see him in a different light.  He's a fancy person who deserves a ride home.  Anthony, first of all, we did stay for Sympathy for the Devil. 
[01:12:30]  Woo!  Woo!  And then we stayed for Jumping Jack Flash.  Yeah.  Which was right after that.  And then Ben, myself, and Lindsey started running during Brown Sugar to get the fuck out  of there.  Uh-huh.  Running.  Ben's freaking.  I finally...  Well...  What was the last song they did?  Well, we only missed two songs, it turned out.  You can't always get what you want, which I really want to see.  That's a pretty good one to see.  And it's only rock and roll, which is whatever to me.  Yeah.  But just a quick side story.  I'm sitting in my seats.  I'm going to my seats, and some security guard yells out, Greg! 
[01:13:00]  Oh.  And I turn, like, how the fuck do you know him?  He goes, no, I know you're Opie, but I don't want to, like, draw attention to you.  I'm a big fan, man.  Thank you.  He goes, I would do anything for you guys.  I'm like, really?  Well, how about better seats?  Ooh.  Because we were way back in the floor.  And that was me joking.  You know how we are.  I'm like, how about better seats?  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Let me see what I can do.  And I don't think anything of it, and I sit in my seats, right?  About a half hour into the concert, he comes by with another big security guard, and he  goes, come here. 
[01:13:30]  And everyone around us thought we were getting kicked out.  Like, uh-oh, what did they do wrong?  This guy got me up to the 40th row.  I was right there.  That's huge.  My seats were amazing for the second half of the concert.  But knowing that we all had a meet, after Sympathy for the Devil, I started making my  way back to the, uh, you know, back to the floor to find Ben.  That's the only person I, because at this point, I still haven't seen Eric.  I assumed he was still in our section.  I grabbed Ben.  Ben sees me immediately.  He's like, dudes, we gotta get the fuck out of here.  So that's when we started running during, I guess, brown sugar.  As we're running out, I'm like, what about Eric? 
[01:14:00]  Have you seen him?  Ben goes, no.  Haven't seen him since the, you know, since the party.  I'm like, give him a call at least, okay?  See where he's at.  He definitely called you.  I know he did it.  I couldn't hear his message, because all I heard was the stones.  But why are your calls back?  He didn't pick up.  You didn't pick up.  I even text messaged him.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait a minute.  No, I got messages from you when I woke up this morning.  No, no.  My phone, no.  Stop.  You did not call my phone.  I'll show you the phone.  Liar, whore, liar, whore.  You know it. 
[01:14:30]  My phone was on the whole time.  Uh-oh.  What is he doing?  What are you calling now?  I just like the visual of them running.  Just running away.  You have to, though.  If you've ever been stuck in that traffic, you're two hours in.  Forever.  Giant Stadium is ruthless.  Giant Stadium is brutal.  There's only a few roads out.  You know, and so we run into the parking lot.  Now, when we arrived at Giant Stadium very early around 5.  So didn't that affect your decision?  What? 
[01:15:00]  Knowing how bad the traffic was to leave one of the members of your platoon behind?  Right.  Yeah.  Willem Dafoe.  But it wasn't like fucking knees in the parking lot.  Yeah, but it wasn't like it was Anthony or Jim Norton.  Helicopter leaving.  It wasn't like it was Anthony or Jim Norton, though, you know?  Oh!  Eric's on his knees, both hands outstretched.  Yeah.  I don't have to kiss his ass.  How concerned?  I don't have to kiss his ass.  I got my own money.  How long was the conversation?  Right.  How long did the conversation last? 
[01:15:30]  Before you put it into drive.  You guys seen Eric?  No, well, I guess.  He's with you.  I'm getting there, but there is another side thing.  We get there at 5 o'clock.  It's Giant Stadium.  The parking lot is pretty empty.  So instead of going, oh, we're at D3, we're like, oh, we know where we parked.  And we just run into the stadium, okay?  We kind of get a visual like, okay, that thing over there.  Oh, and that light pole.  Okay, fine.  So Ben and I and Lindsey, we run out during Brown Sugar.  Now we're like, we've got to get to the fucking car.  Ben's like, dude, there's 10 minutes left. 
[01:16:00]  There's two songs left.  I'm telling you, this place is going to clear out at any moment.  Also, we run out to this completely filled parking lot.  It looks completely different.  We all start looking around.  And I wasn't drinking last night.  And I'm like, holy shit, where do we park?  Had no fucking clue.  So as I said, where do we park?  I had my direction I thought it was in.  Ben's like, it's over there.  Lindsey's like, it's over there.  Everyone is pointing in a different direction.  And now the panic is setting in because you know this thing is letting out at any second. 
[01:16:30]  There were 70,000 people there.  Mix on stage.  You want to hear one more?  We've got time for one more.  And we're just like scratching our head running around the parking lot.  Where the fuck is the car?  It was like a game.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.  Good night.  No!  New Jersey rocks!  Right.  And it even got to the point, and that's where I...  You're so wrong, Eric.  The fireworks were going off.  Because I guess they do that during the last song or whatever. 
[01:17:00]  And we still didn't find the car.  We had no clue.  Dude, we were running in all directions.  One more time for Charlie Waltz.  No!  So, it's kind of dark out there.  We're in three different sections.  And I'm hitting my thing, like, praying that all of a sudden I'm just going to see, like,  headlights.  Yeah, you need a longer range on those things.  Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, with the lights going.  So, we kind of lucked out.  All of a sudden, I beeped, and I was only a couple rows away, and I start screaming,  Oh, the hair! 
[01:17:30]  And then they start running toward my voice.  You were not at my car.  I know I wasn't at your car.  I said I wasn't at your car.  So, you didn't know where the car was?  Neither did you.  I just knew where the gate was where we came in.  But why aren't you calling us at that point?  He was hoping to meet with people and not just find the car yourself.  You were going to meet them somewhere because you didn't know where the car was.  I went to the area that I knew it was in.  I didn't know exactly where it was in.  You didn't hear us screaming.  We were losing our minds.  We're like, you know, screaming.  Freaking out.  And like an idiot.  We were freaking out.  And we covered so much area, it's not even funny. 
[01:18:00]  And we were all separate.  We were all separate.  On phones, finding each other.  Dude, I had a run after I was in the parking lot, easily a quarter-mile circle.  Easily.  Just ran like this all the way around and lucked out.  Finally, something started to make sense to me.  And as you're running, at any point, do you have any concern for Eric?  We called him during Mount Sugar.  We did have concern.  Scale of 1 to 10.  Well, wait a second.  When we got in the car, the thing was, he's going to be fine.  There was an XM bus coming back to the city.  There was plenty of room on the XM bus. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  There's another mode of transportation.  For all the XM people.  They were going back to the Hudson Hotel.  Dude, there was 100 people from XM.  Hold on.  Eric, did you know about this bus?  Yes, I knew about this bus.  Okay.  Eric did know about the bus.  Did you come over in the bus?  No, I came with Opie.  In the car.  Wow.  Came with Opie.  You're a dick.  Came with Opie.  I'm just saying, you know?  I'm looking good so far.  Come on.  I knew about the bus, but he did come with Opie.  All right.  A little way in the decision.  So you were in the parking lot somewhere.  Yeah.  And you called Ben.  When I got his, in the message I couldn't hear, I called him. 
[01:19:00]  I even texted him.  I said, when are you guys leaving?  Where are you?  That's a temporary crap phone.  And I had the Blackberry number, which is a Washington number, which is a temporary number  that I have.  Well, the other phone gets fixed.  Uh-oh.  So now I wasn't aware of the technical glitch.  I wasn't prepared technologically for the phone call.  There's a technical glitch in Benza equipment.  Opie wasn't aware of where they parked.  I'm seeing a lot of negligence on the prosecution's part.  I'm seeing negligence also.  Right. 
[01:19:30]  Did you, when you got into your car to finally leave, Opie, right before you shut the door,  did you stand up on the bottom of the door and look around a little bit?  Fuck no, dude.  The fireworks were already going.  I see no concerns.  Opie, how many concerts have you been to in your life?  Oh, my God, hundreds.  How many times have you been to the mall?  A bunch of times.  Now, isn't one of the things you learn as a youth, the first time you get lost, to always  remember where you parked?  Yeah.  So that was negligence on your part? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Negligence on his part.  He didn't know where we parked.  And it was the bus.  That's why we went the way.  Yeah, the bus thing really is a good one.  Right, right.  I see a group negligence, but you've got to accept responsibility as the guy that drove is  the leader.  You are the one that leaves the car and goes, look, we're at Goofy 5.  You know, we're at Mickey 8.  You know, you've got to let people know so there isn't any confusion.  And there's always other modes of transportation.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So I guess technically, in your world, you can always leave somebody behind. 
[01:20:30]  There's an XM bus.  There's just ways to get back.  A Learjet.  We found the car.  The fireworks were going off.  And Ben goes, hurry, hurry, hurry.  We backed out and peeled out.  Flew.  I mean, he drove out really fast.  We were flying.  But we...  You guys would make some great Army Rangers, man.  Never leave anyone behind.  Ah, fuck them.  The Iraqis will pick them up.  Oh, I'm the first person to leave someone at a concert.  The POW flag is a silhouette of his head. 
[01:21:00]  Eric's head just looking down.  So we pull...  You know, we're gone.  We're gone.  My phone didn't ring all the way to the city.  Is there any conversations about Eric?  Yeah, and on the ride home, was there a wow?  I said, don't worry, he'll get on the bus.  Or I didn't know Steve had already left.  Steve lives right by the metal.  And you've got the XM bus.  You've got the New Jersey Transit.  And then there's always limo drivers.  He won $100,000 yesterday.  Yeah, he won $100,000.  He can get a limo easily after a concert there.  A little resentment by other friends. 
[01:21:30]  I'm seeing that also.  The money's won.  The guy wins $100,000 and they ditch him.  All right.  Well, I want to know about the bus.  When did you know where we're going?  11.15 and I'm standing by the exit gate where all the cars are going out.  And I realize they're gone.  I've got to go try to find that bus.  11.15, you know what I was doing?  I swear to you at 11.15, I was already asleep.  We were back from Manhattan.  I was all ready.  Him standing at the gate hoping to see Opie's car drive by and Opie in bed snoring. 
[01:22:00]  No joke.  Dude, no joke.  I ran home.  I didn't even brush my teeth.  Nothing.  I was in a nice room filled with A.C.  All comfy.  Eric's still leaving pathetic messages.  Yeah.  Guys, I don't see you.  Where are you guys?  Are you still getting out?  Are you still getting out of the place?  Are you caught in the traffic?  I'm on the northeast side.  Right.  I was in La La Land.  I was in deep sleep because it was a long day. 
[01:22:30]  I was tired.  I'm not kidding.  I was out cold by 11.15.  Because we made it to the city in 15 minutes.  Nothing.  We were back so fast.  Yeah, that would explain the...  The thought there's other modes of transportation is a euphemism for fuck them.  Right.  That is so fuck them.  Now, I want to know about the bus.  Now, the bus was...  All right.  So now...  The XM bus.  You didn't realize we left you until 11.15.  That's crazy.  I stood by that gate.  Because you knew we wanted to get out of there by 10.30.  We were even late leaving at that point.  Because you wouldn't think that, you know, friends of yours would... 
[01:23:00]  Right.  Right.  They couldn't possibly have left without me.  You must have panicked because...  Let someone else promote your HBO show.  I'm gone.  I'm gone.  He's like...  He's getting a text.  He's the guy that left.  You're blaming the victim.  Right.  What were you wearing, you fucking whore?  We could never be happy for anyone.  You rode over together.  You left the guy.  You fucked him.  I think subconsciously we can never be happy for anyone on this show.  And the fucking guy won $100,000 yesterday.  So we had to like...  He wasn't wearing the right wristband.  He was asking for it. 
[01:23:30]  You must have been in full panic mode, Eric.  Because I've got three calls on my phones from you around 11.15, 11.16.  I have four calls from you when I woke up this morning.  So, I don't know.  Maybe something was going on with my phone.  Ben knows my phone did not ring.  No.  From brown sugar all the way home.  I'm telling you.  And then there's one text message.  So I see a text message and it says from Eric.  And I'm like, oof.  You know, I know it's really ugly.  You fucking fuck.  That's exactly what it was. 
[01:24:00]  So I hit read and I'm like...  You know, and my eyes are closed and I open them up and it's like...  All it says is, thanks a lot, bro.  Oh, no.  You wrote bro.  All in big, big fuck you letters, you know.  Yeah, he was in concert speech.  Right.  Fuck you, bro.  Thanks a lot, bro.  And you could tell that the bro was typed out really hard.  B-R-O.  All in capitals.  All in capitals.  And I'm like, oof.  This is going to be an ugly morning. 
[01:24:30]  I think that bro was sarcastic.  But 11.15, you're watching the parking lot empty?  Yeah.  And at that point, I started calling Steve because I figured, all right, Steve probably  didn't leave early because he's not that far from there.  Maybe Steve's still stuck in the parking lot.  I can find Steve.  By the way, for the rest of the country.  Stuck in the parking lot, he actually looked up and saw...  Oh, there he goes.  See, Steve...  Thanks, another message.  Thanks a lot.  Oh, wow.  Steve stayed all the way through the fireworks, the encores and the goodbyes and the thank 
[01:25:00]  yous because...  He doesn't have to wait in traffic with that hybrid.  No.  He certainly does.  He flew over everybody.  Right over.  Mick pointed at his car.  It was great.  Look at that little thing.  It's the future.  But for the rest of the country, just so you know, Giant Stadium is in the middle of nowhere.  It's a swamp.  It's in the middle of a swamp.  It's not...  A lot of these stadiums in other cities, you can walk a little bit and you find maybe a  taxi or something, but not this case.  You don't want to be left in the swamp.  No. 
[01:25:30]  Left in the swamp.  So 1115, you realize we're gone.  You're calling Steve.  They're gone.  So what happens?  No response from Steve.  So I said, fuck, I better try to find that XM bus.  So I go running over...  Buses are gone.  Buses are gone?  Buses are gone.  Don't you have Will's number?  No, I don't.  You don't have any...  Those buses were gone.  They moved...  They cleared that whole area for this big wraparound line that went almost around the entire  stadium for the buses for the transit authority.  Oh, my God.  So that's where I wound up standing in line waiting to get a bus to get back to you. 
[01:26:00]  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  You said this morning the bus was full.  Right.  The XM bus was full.  Oh, wait.  The guys won in.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Come on in, non-winners of $100,000.  What do you got to say, Danny?  No, I was just going to agree with Ben.  He did say this morning that he didn't get on the bus because the bus was full.  All right.  Not that the bus had left, but the bus was full.  This is now getting shaky on your butt.  The defense is falling apart.  No, but we need...  You know, you need to examine him as a character witness.  That's true. 
[01:26:30]  I mean, he's also extremely jealous right now.  Yeah.  However, and also...  Willing to sell him down the river.  I would seriously doubt with the money that XM spent and these high-profile clients that  came in from all over the country, they would leave that fast and everybody would have gotten  back to the bus because people are buying t-shirts and stopped at the retail.  Objection, speculation on the prosecution.  Throw it out.  Don't acknowledge his testimony now.  Throw it out.  So you never saw the XM bus?  No.  I didn't see them.  You're saying you never saw it, but you told people that it was full.  You told people it was full.  Well, my name...  Because my name wasn't on the list. 
[01:27:00]  What?  Wait, what?  This is falling apart quickly.  Yeah, there's something else in this story.  There's something else that was going on.  Wait a minute.  Is all I'm going to say.  Did you see the bus at all last night?  Didn't see that bus at all.  And you didn't see anyone from XM?  When I left, no.  Anyone from that party?  There was 100 people at that party.  No, the sales...  I was sitting where all the sales staff and their clients were.  I had left before they did.  I want to get more into this.  The bus was full statement you made this morning.  What were you saying that about?  Yesterday, when I got the instructions for getting my ticket and how to get to the game, 
[01:27:30]  they said, do you need to go on the bus because the bus is going to be full?  I'll put your name.  No, I'm going with Opie.  Oh, so you were speculating that the XM bus would be full on the way back also.  So you didn't even use that as an option.  No, because I was supposedly going home with Opie.  And then when I realized maybe I could still try to catch the bus, there were no buses.  How did you get home?  Waited on line to get a bus to the Port Authority. 
[01:28:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Oh, my.  Let me answer this.  What's the worst thing you said as you were standing there muttering to yourself?  What's the worst thing that you said?  Oh, I don't know.  I was just, I was so.  I bet it was really bad and really personal and about Opie and Ben.  Wishing some sort of disease.  Right.  Here's the other thing, though.  You just want a hundred grand.  Cancer of the ass. 
[01:28:30]  That fuck.  How long did it take to get a bus?  I waited almost an hour and twenty minutes until I got to the bus.  Oh, my God.  And that's a long hour and twenty.  Oh, yeah.  That is a long.  That isn't hanging out with a hot chick hour and twenty.  That isn't watching a good movie hour and twenty.  That is just looking at your watch every three minutes. 
[01:29:00]  That's humid Meadowlands swamp air.  And it, oh, I would end like that.  Right.  You win a hundred grand.  You got wristbands for the stones.  At the end of the day, you're standing in a swamp with the common people.  Oh, well, and muttering.  Waiting for the New Jersey transit.  Typing text messages to people who you thought were your friends.  I got to be honest.  I got to be honest.  I can look anyone in the eye.  No problem.  Even when it gets a little tough.  And Eric's been with us a year now.  I'm having a tough time looking at him this morning.  Yeah, you guys fucked him. 
[01:29:30]  For the first time.  You fucked him.  It gets worse.  All right.  So you waited an hour and a half or an hour and twenty minutes for a poor, tharty bus.  Now, you live in Brooklyn.  What time was it when you got on the bus?  Knowing that...  It had to be well after 1 a.m.  Oh, my God.  I was already asleep for a solid two hours.  A solid two hours.  Did you at least get to sit down on the bus or are you standing in the aisle?  I sat down.  Mama!  Oh, God. 
[01:30:00]  This is awful.  Before we move on, Crazy Adam says there's a hole in Eric's defense.  Crazy Adam.  Hey.  If Ben has a different phone, doesn't the caller ID show the number?  Why couldn't you call the caller ID back?  No, it's a...  Wait.  You said your BlackBerry's a different number, right?  Yeah, the BlackBerry's a Washington number.  Washington number.  Yeah, but a number's a number, man.  I mean...  So Eric could have just called that number back, whatever it was.  I don't have that number.  I have his New York number. 
[01:30:30]  But did the number show up on your phone when Ben did call you?  When Ben called you.  And did you really call my phone?  Yes, I called your phone.  Starting at 10.30.  Plus, it's a D.C. area code.  You probably think it's some poor you banged down there on a promotion.  I think the forensic guys there should take a look at his phone.  We need the phone records.  Yeah.  You should have that guy from A&E do the narration.  You know what?  You have this horrible tragedy.  You know what?  Here's the deal.  1 a.m.  I did not bring...  Stranded at the Meadowlands.  I did not bring my phone in. 
[01:31:00]  Did you leave messages?  There were some hang-ups.  I had four voicemails.  Three were hang-ups.  No, one was from Ben because he left something in my car.  Two were hang-ups.  And one was finally you just saying, thanks a lot.  Bro.  Or something like that.  So, I don't have my phone on me.  I could call my house and we could get to the bottom of it when those calls came in.  Okay.  All right?  And I'll be completely honest.  But I'm telling you, the phone did not ring from 10.30 when we started leaving all the  way until I dropped Ben off and went home. 
[01:31:30]  There are people waiting for buses that aren't there.  Why are they waiting for these buses?  But I will...  You go to the concert with three friends.  You leave with two.  Nothing.  I don't want to talk about this, Larry.  It's awful.  This poor man was standing there.  And no one would pick him up.  The bus was full.  He had to write thanks to Laka Bro.  We got E-Rock's mind checking in. 
[01:32:00]  E-Rock's mind.  What's up?  Worst thing I was thinking that night, it wasn't my pals.  It was that fucking meal ticket comment.  She was just pulling those strings.  Oh, the paycheck.  The paycheck left you there, my friend.  You know what?  That might have played into it a little bit.  Oh, boy.  A seedy story of resentment.  Resentment?  Laying itself out in a swamp in New Jersey.  So, 11.15, you realize...  So, what time did you get on the bus?  1.15, right? 
[01:32:30]  I couldn't tell you.  I know it was well after 1 a.m.  1.15, while Opie slept at home.  Eric was just getting on a bus.  What time would he get home?  How would he get home?  Stay tuned.  We'll be back after these words.  Well, that is the music.  Very good, Derek.  Very creepy.  All right, so you're on a Port Authority bus back to Manhattan?  Yeah.  Which sucks because you live in Brooklyn.  So, you've got to go all the way back to Manhattan and then take a...  Yeah, now what happens is that the Jersey buses don't take you home to your house in Brooklyn. 
[01:33:00]  No, so I get off at the Port Authority.  Then I've got to go downstairs and around this other area because they're cleaning.  So, they brought that off to go to where the taxi line is.  Uh-huh.  All the cabs that are waiting there, going to Jersey, going to Jersey, going to Jersey.  No.  So, I'm in this now another line waiting to get a taxi to try to get back to Brooklyn.  Oh, my God.  But...  I get tapped.  I turn around.  It's Stalker Patty.  Hi!  What is Stalker Patty doing out in the middle of the night? 
[01:33:30]  Her and those...  And a few other people were coming back from some gambling junket in Atlantic City.  Oh, she's hooked.  So, she's like, what are you doing here?  Waiting for a cab.  Oh, oh, it was nice to see you.  And then she...  She left.  She will pop up everywhere.  It's really creepy.  It's not like it's a small town.  This is New York City.  And she pops up everywhere.  I finally had to tell her to stop following me on the subway because she was doing that for a while.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  When I was still commuting back to Long Island. 
[01:34:00]  She would just happen to be on my subway and after the third time of her saying,  Wow, what a coincidence.  I'm like, Patty, I know what you're doing.  Stop.  Please stop.  Eric, you could hop on the jitney.  I'm sure the jitney will take you there.  How is she going to Atlantic City every goddamn weekend on weekdays?  She was getting back from an Atlantic City junket on a Thursday.  Some slot machine tournament.  Get her on the phone.  We've got to hear about the slot machine tournament. 
[01:34:30]  The World Series of Losers.  Tournament.  Like she's got a headband on.  I'm like, there's something fucking athletic about it.  Yeah, what kind of tournament?  The machines are doing the work.  I don't like this bucket.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Warm-ups are just cracking your knuckles a lot, you know, getting ready.  All right, so what happens?  You're on this line for a cab back to Brooklyn.  What time is it?  It's now 2 a.m.  Oh, it's 2 in the morning.  We've got to be here at, what, 5.30?  Give us one soundbite of something that you said about either one of these two creeps who just left you there. 
[01:35:00]  Honestly, I said, they're sitting in that car laughing that I'm still out here.  I figured they did it intentionally because they've done it a few other places.  But I never thought they would do it in here.  We did it where?  You tried doing it to me in Washington Station.  What he wanted to do to you in Washington would have been really bad because Ope wanted to report your bags.  You went in the bathroom.  Remember this?  This is when we first went to Washington.  You were going to say that you saw those bags unattended?  Oh, yeah.  There's a history of it. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  I thought that was a bad call.  I was like, no, no, no, that's not a good idea.  Yeah.  But we did, I think, didn't we ditch you at the, uh...  He was ditched once before.  Where were we?  We ditched you over?  Yes, we ditched him somewhere.  I'm remembering.  It's like, where's Eric?  We ditched him.  I think it was at the train station in Washington.  Was it a car or a limo or something?  Was it the X Games?  I can't remember where it was, but there was some point where we were like, where's Eric?  Fuck him.  I remember that was said. 
[01:36:00]  Patty's on the phone, by the way.  I know.  We'll get to Patty in a second.  So, uh...  So now it's after 2 a.m., and you have to be...  Why don't you just come back to the station at that point?  You have to be here at 5.30 in the morning.  I was fed up.  So I took a cab back, took a shower, slept, and then came back here to work.  How much did that whole trip cost you to come back?  $45.  $45.  Bag of shells, right?  Right, my friend?  You still have $99,955. 
[01:36:30]  That's right.  Don't worry about it.  You don't have $100,000 anymore.  $45.  In 5 hours of your life that you'll never get back.  So what do you do?  Sleep an hour?  I think so.  Like an hour, hour and a half, got up, and then came to work.  Because I've got to tell you, man, after sleeping 6 hours, I feel a little tired today.  Yeah.  Just a little tired.  I usually get 8, but I got 6, so I'm a little groggy today.  My heart pulls for you.  You know, for a guy who won $100,000, went to the Stones last night.  He doesn't look that happy, doesn't he? 
[01:37:00]  He's miserable.  That's $100,000.  Man, I'd have been walking home whistling zippity-doo-dah.  Like, what the fuck?  Yeah, you won $100,000, you got to see the Rolling Stones, you know.  Not a bad day.  How much did the ticket cost you to see the Stones?  Nothing.  Exactly.  As much as we fucked them, I think there's more to the story that you're not telling.  Yeah, there's something going on.  There's something else that was going on that might have distracted you.  Any girls involved in this story that we don't know about?  No.  No?  Nope.  Come on, you're feeling good, you made some money, you want to be a big shot. 
[01:37:30]  No.  You pull out your wad.  Big shot.  No?  No.  I had a great seat.  The Cosmo was great.  He had no money there, so he has to pull out his scratch-and-match ticket.  I won.  Trying to get the girls to go.  Yeah, didn't the Daily News give you a t-shirt to wear?  I won.  We got another winner.  I am the winner.  Who's the winner?  Right away.  Ladies.  One at a time.  All right, let's say hi to Matt in New Jersey.  Matt, what's going on today?  Hey, guys. 
[01:38:00]  Hey.  I was just calling and telling you, Eric, let this die.  If you would have made Opie late this morning or had him sleeping late, you know how pissed  off you would be for the rest of the day?  Just let it die and count your thousands of dollars.  Yeah, it's one of those sucks-to-be-you type of things.  All right, why don't you let the listeners be the jury?  Yeah.  Jeremy, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Why should we care?  Why couldn't Scrooge McDuck here spend $75, rent himself a car service, and be home in  45 minutes? 
[01:38:30]  Exactly.  That's a heartless jury.  That's two for the prosecution.  Yeah.  Do you know you could have just called the numbers you hear all the time, 777-777-777,  one of those, and you could have gotten a town car to pick you up, drive you from there  to your door for probably a little bit more than you wound up spending anyway.  Not only that, I mean, there's plenty of cars going back.  I've gone and just asked people, hey, you're going back to Manhattan, can I give you 20  bucks or whatever?  People do that all the time.  Yeah, you just go up to the windows of the cars and go, hey, take me back there, I'll  throw you some money.  Here's my friend. 
[01:39:00]  They'll take you right back.  Well, that's a whole other side.  You're just saying what he should do after they fuck him.  After they fuck him.  Well, it's like, yeah.  You've already been fucked.  Don't take a shower, wait till the police, examine your privates.  Exactly.  That's what you're saying.  They got to get the rape kit.  They got raped.  They got to pull out the rape kit and take some swabs.  Yeah.  I mean, you're spinning this off into another.  I know.  We're talking about the initial struggle.  Right.  I'm at the point where you're like, you should go to therapy, you should try to work out. 
[01:39:30]  What a roller coaster of a day for the guy, though, man.  Holy crap.  Chuck?  Yeah, you want to go to some of these phone calls?  Let's go to North Carolina.  Chuck, what's going on?  I was just wondering if Rosie was on the bus with him.  Hey, this is Eric.  He just won money.  Hey, and his friends fucked him and left him at the concert.  Oh, that horrible movie Rosie did where she played the retard?  You see that one?  It's classic.  Oh, it's great.  His friends left him, and now he's fucked.  That's exactly how she sounded. 
[01:40:00]  Look at his text.  He's texting something.  Wait a minute.  Fuck off, bro.  Matt, Jersey.  Hey, I just noticed that I just continued the streak of good luck for the show after Jimmy left.  You know?  You guys get lesbians, and now Eric wins $100,000.  What's next?  That is true.  That is true.  We've been on a nice roll, except for the Rolling Stones thing.  Well, that was just for Eric.  The guy, let's weigh out the fucking luck here, people.  Let's put it on the scales over here.  You win $100,000.  You had to spend $45 and a couple of hours getting home from the Stones show. 
[01:40:30]  I think it evens out somewhere.  Not even evens out.  Exactly.  By tomorrow morning when you wake up, when you get a good night's sleep, that'll just be a little nuisance thing.  You still got the $100,000.  Most people would be happy just to have a free Rolling Stones to get the Tours completely sold out.  You know?  So you got screwed going back.  You want $100,000 on top of it.  I want to point to the jury that the prosecution just admitted to fucking him over.  I heard that.  I heard that.  He just admitted.  You got screwed. 
[01:41:00]  Eric's not thankful enough for the fine day he had.  Motivation?  Look at his face.  He's like, I should be thanking you.  You want $100,000?  Yeah, let's put this on the table.  You want $100,000?  Establishing motive right now.  Right.  It was a wonderful VIP party with free booze and food.  Opie, are you saying you want Eric to say thank you to you?  Yeah.  Opie is kind of right.  At any point, did he go into some sort of convenience store and you guys hatched this plant? 
[01:41:30]  Look at him in there.  Actually.  Getting a Coke?  He doesn't look thankful, does he?  Son of a bitch wins $100,000.  He should be thanking Anthony.  What did I do?  He got your tickets.  He got your ticket.  Yes, you did.  Wow.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did.  Anthony was offered the tickets.  Yeah, I was.  And he didn't go.  Eric, all I'm asking today is that...  That could have been me getting fucked.  All I'm asking today is that you thank me.  That's all.  Wow.  It was a VIP party, free food, free food, really nice Rolling Stones tickets. 
[01:42:00]  Don't do it.  Don't do it, Eric.  If you do that, I'll beat you with that fucking microphone.  You had a nice ride to the venue.  You got a free t-shirt, a free program.  You let them in your head, Eric.  And I just want to add this to the pile.  I picked you out of obscurity.  You were just working for a tiny little station in the middle of nowhere in Florida.  You've never officially thanked me on the air.  That's a baldy move, man.  What do you think?  Can I pick and choose what I can thank you for? 
[01:42:30]  No.  You know what?  He deserves it.  One general thank you.  That's all.  Oh, my God.  I remember when I was coming back from Florida and I met you in the middle of nowhere on a...  Okay.  Thank you for the career.  I can't believe it.  You know what, dude?  No.  You fucking deserve to be left in a swamp.  That could be my greatest accomplishment ever.  Oh, man.  I can't believe I just spent fucking a half hour defending you and you turn around and do  that shit.  Thank him.  Who the fuck raised you?  That's the most pathetic thing I've ever heard in my life. 
[01:43:00]  They left you in a fucking swamp.  He doesn't have a fucking leg to stand on.  Oh, my God.  And over the air, you just fucking genuflect.  You just kissed his fucking ring.  But I had a lot of ammo, man.  He never thanked me.  I actually pulled over.  I pulled over at a what?  What was it?  A cracker barrel?  Unbelievable.  We went to eat at a cracker barrel in the middle of nowhere in the middle of Florida.  That's how I met the kid.  He's me with the cat box, the garbage, and the vacuum.  Unbelievable.  Just smiling.  Shoulder slump. 
[01:43:30]  You are step and fetch it.  How much money do you need to win before you get some fucking spine in you?  You have an F.U. nest egg right there.  It's F.U. money.  You're a battered woman sometimes, really.  He didn't mean it.  He didn't mean it.  I know he really cares deep down.  He didn't even do that.  And he said he's going to change.  No.  Yeah, he said you need to thank me.  He smacked him again.  He smacked him again.  He smacked him again.  He smacked him again.  And he did it.  Not for the swamp.  Eric started this morning going to himself, oh, I'm going to give him a piece of my mind. 
[01:44:00]  And by the end of the morning, he's thanking me.  He had a moment of courage.  Thanks a lot, bro.  Bro.  I finally welled up in him and you beat him back down.  Now we realize he was really thanking him.  Thanks a lot, bro.  Oh.  Wow.  Holy crap.  I don't know what to tell you, man.  I tried to defend you.  Hold on, Danny, what's up?  Well, nothing.  I was just thinking about this whole scratch and match situation.  Yeah.  And I could swear that Eric was taking the scratch and match things out of the show papers that 
[01:44:30]  we get every morning.  Oh, boy.  So, I mean, and technically, technically the papers are delivered to Ben.  And technically you ain't getting shit.  Hey, you got a set of balls.  I don't get too mad at that.  Hey, Danny.  What's this world coming to? 
[01:45:00]  Danny's going to shoot him.  Yeah, but I'm not asking for any.  You are.  I thought you said spider.  The papers were everyone's spider.  Eric fought back and everyone stood up.  Come on.  Bring it on.  Danny just got a raise.  Was it the papers from here?  No.  Because that would make a big difference.  I think they better write another name on that.  No, one, we don't get the Sunday Daily News here, too.  I bring them from home.  Ben's saying, yes, we do get the Sunday Daily News.  And that Sunday we pulled it out.  And didn't we pull out and realize that those two were winners in the Sunday paper that we 
[01:45:30]  got here?  And that made us think, wow, this really is widespread.  Because not only did Eric Nagel say he won, but the papers from the station actually won  100 grand.  Oh, wait.  I'll go remember that.  Yeah, that's right.  I'll go pull it out of that.  You know what?  He's right.  We did do that.  Because there were so many winners.  I was like, wow, they really did fuck up.  Because what are the odds that you're going to win and the station papers are going to  win?  Now, are you sure that that was yours?  I'm positive it was mine.  I know exactly what happened.  Oh, Travis knows exactly what happened. 
[01:46:00]  I came in that day and I went home after that.  Thank you.  I want to take no chances in this.  And I brought the story up and Eric goes, oh, I have a copy of the scratchy match in the  studio.  I'll run in and see if I win.  Oh.  And he scratched it off and lo and behold, he won.  And then after the show, he said, of course, I'm going to mail it in.  Why wouldn't I?  You're saying that absolutely the one that he sent in was from the station's paper? 
[01:46:30]  Absolutely.  No.  Yes.  No.  When I came in that bin that you had over there for months.  Oh, man.  It was pink.  What do we got?  About 10 people working?  Actually, no, it's purple.  I want my 10 grand.  10 grand.  10 grand.  10 grand.  10 grand.  10 grand for everybody.  Wow.  Eric, I want you to apologize for using one of the station's papers.  Why wouldn't you apologize for taking food out of their mouths is what you're doing?  Because one, it wasn't a station paper.  Travis disagrees with that. 
[01:47:00]  It's a station paper.  He can disagree all he wants.  He's not getting any money.  Let's get a lawyer.  This would make for great radio, man.  Let's sue one of our own.  I think they deserve to share in this.  Make us spend 80 grand of the winnings on defense.  Oh, Jesus.  He would, too.  Eric, if you just get...  See, I'm thinking I...  I don't know.  I should get...  There's 10 of us, right?  I should get 10,000.  You give me 1,000, I won't sue you.  No.  You want to settle it?  Just settle out?  I'll just settle out. 
[01:47:30]  What do you think about settling out with everybody?  A grand for everyone.  That's nothing, really.  10 grand out of 100 grand?  I would have done it anyway.  You've got to do something.  Just to be a decent guy.  How about a nice, like, lunch for everybody?  Something.  Yeah, I offered that to all of them yesterday.  I said I was going to take them out for lunch and dinner.  But now you don't want to take them out because they just threw you under a bus.  I didn't throw you under a bus.  Those guys did.  That was one of the first things I said.  By leaving his ass in the swamp, somehow it ends up with you apologizing to him. 
[01:48:00]  I've never fucking seen it.  Unbelievable.  I really can't believe that they would throw you under a bus like that.  You know?  I would never do that to you.  Where are you taking him to lunch?  What happened to five minutes ago?  Would you guys accept lunch from him?  No, they're all shaking their heads.  They don't want it.  Wow.  They don't want it.  Let's see.  Which way?  Let's say hi to...  Does Eric have a car?  I guess we're done.  What are you going to do with the 100 grand? 
[01:48:30]  What do you got?  Any plans?  Just going to invest it.  Invest it.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What are you investing in?  Not sure yet.  I'm working on that.  Citadel stock.  Yeah, you want to buy some Citadel?  Yeah, I'll give you my Citadel stock.  Uh, something safe?  Something long-term or a little risky to make money quickly on?  Something long-term, I think.  Yeah.  You want mutual funds?  Blue chips.  Have you talked to that tough guy, Barry Shapiro.  Guy that packs a mean punch. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, we'll talk to Stalker Patty after the break, I guess.  About her Atlantic City junket.  I think she's really getting addicted to the gambling thing.  She needs to be going all the time.  I'm glad we cleared this up, Eric.  And your apology is accepted.  Yeah, I'll accept your apology.  All's well, Matt.  I like how he's sitting there thinking it over.  How the fuck did that happen?  I was so right. 
[01:49:30]  So right, yet he...  Apologized.  He apologized.  And thanked someone for his career.  He still had fucking dirt on his knees from that swamp.  The swamp.  He left him at a swamp.  Oh, you know what?  Never seen anything like this.  At the end of any.  Thanks, mate.  All right, we better take a break.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was a time we gave away $100,000.  Yes!  We haven't played this thing in a while, Anthony. 
[01:50:00]  A lot of new listeners.  We were at a radio station in the Boston area.  And one day we decided to give away $100,000.  And here's the winning phone call.  Check it out.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  No, no way!  Tell me, I won!  I won!  I don't know what you're kidding, right?  107th.  Oh, wow!  107th caller, congratulations.  100 grand! 
[01:50:30]  Oh, my God!  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with the 100 grand?  Oh, man, the first thing.  I have just all...  Oh, I cannot...  Jesus.  I've got to calm...  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner!  I'm the winner!  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand, bro?  I got this...  Oh, man, I got this s*** box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one.  A new truck.  Oh, that...  Oh.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar. 
[01:51:00]  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f*** you've been saying?  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of douchebags.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Congratulations, man.  Uh-oh.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus. 
[01:51:30]  Well, Jimmy, now you're not going to like this.  I'm sure I won't.  This, uh, you like the big labia, and it says, in some cases, large labia can create hygiene  problems or affect sexual function.  Now, here's the hygiene problems they're talking about, these rookies.  That when she tinkles, sometimes a little tinkle gets caught up in there and stays.  Yeah.  And let me tell you, that makes for a lovely aroma.  A lovely, wafting aroma.  You are something else, my friend. 
[01:52:00]  And he's not even making a joke.  You like it a little dirty.  No.  No, that's, no, because that's called dirty.  No, no, no.  Dirty to me.  It's not like she's picking up a steel with it.  If it gets dirty, it's because of whiz.  Now, there's a dirty sweat that's, there's an unhygienic, there is a difference between  being a slight musk that is just a natural thing and being dirty.  There's a dirty smell and there's a sexy smell.  Believe me, I don't like dirty.  I don't like a filthy, awful pussy.  If they're getting caught in the labia, though.  Tinkle, when tinkle gets trapped in there, for how long, would you say? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, maybe a week.  A week?  Nah, you know, just from that morning.  I would always tell girlfriends who I was dating, do not shower right before you come over.  I don't want to talk to you.  See, because you like it a little dirty.  Shower that day.  Shower that day.  I don't like a girl to go three days without a shower.  I can't do that.  No.  Just that day.  Shower in the morning, go to work, and then come over and, you know.  You like that.  Yeah, but you've got to shower that morning.  I'm not that earthy.  What do you have at all?  Speaking of earthy.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  They also can get caught in undergarments and make it difficult to wear tight pants or  tiny bikinis.  Right.  Tiny bikinis.  Oh, I love it.  Knuckle, or if you've seen the camel toe, or sometimes the bikini just gets caught up  in there and it comes out the side.  I fucking salivate for that.  By the way, what if it get caught in clothes?  What are you, what are you constantly in buildings that are on fire at three o'clock in the morning?  How fast do you have to get dressed?  If you're zipping your labia up, perhaps you do need this procedure. 
[01:53:30]  Perhaps you need to email yellowtreats at AOL.com.  You have a dinner coming, sweetie.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  So be it, friend no more, to secure pieces, to prepare for war.  So be it, settle the score, touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore. 
[01:54:00]  Bravo.  Great job, Eric.  Now go get your fucking shine box.  Metallica.  Dane Cook coming in at 9.30, I believe.  I don't think he's ever done our show in studio.  Not live, no.  Just funners.  We've had a couple phone calls from him over the years.  He's blowing up big time.  Bill Burr also blowing up. 
[01:54:30]  I think he's made probably $100,000 off of his record sales.  Maybe $100,000.  Bill Burr is going to be on HBO tonight at midnight.  Half hour comedy special.  I'll watch that one for sure.  On HBO.  He's a very funny guy, but I'm not going to really push it anymore because he wasn't on  my side during that last break.  It was just such a gang mentality.  No one was.  Someone had to defend it.  That's what happens on the show, though.  And I did up until the apology.  No one comes to your side on the show. 
[01:55:00]  You fuck up.  Everyone attacks.  Everybody.  Everyone.  All right.  Felt bad for them.  Oh, well, is this true?  What?  That's some of the FEMA debit cards that they handed out are now found they were being  used at a strip club.  Nice.  At a gentleman's club.  Bravo.  That's fantastic.  Because you're giving these things out to people that don't have much responsibility 
[01:55:30]  to begin with.  Right.  All of a sudden, they're going to change their lives and go, hey, let's put this money to  good use.  That's great.  They're really saying that, though?  Yeah.  You can stand on the side of the road, I swear to God, with some sort of bin and some sort  of official-looking thing and just say New Orleans Relief, and idiots will come up and  put cash in it.  Yeah.  You'll make some money.  Sure.  I'm sure it's happening.  There's always scammers.  There's more scams than actual charities.  Yeah.  They said that there's like 20 websites out there.  Yeah.  All phony. 
[01:56:00]  People trying to get...  Immediately, who gets KatrinaAid.com or something?  You think it's legitimate, or you think it's just some guy?  You know what?  This still, as dirtbag as that is, there's something just fucking hilarious.  You know they're giggling like fucking third graders when they're setting the thing up.  Yeah.  Like, dude, you believe we're going to fucking do this?  The money's going to pour in.  Just sitting there on the phone.  Yeah, I know.  I feel bad for the victims, too.  Yeah.  Look at all your face.  Hey!  All right. 
[01:56:30]  Let's see.  Oh, we want to talk to Stalker Patty.  Yeah, I want to know what she's doing.  During Eric's adventure last night, he ended up on a, I don't know, a taxi line at 2 in the morning,  and Stalker Patty was behind you.  Right?  Yeah.  Something like that.  And we got Stalker Patty on the phone.  Stalker Patty.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi, Patty.  How are you?  Uh, now, you saw Eric?  Yes, I did.  He was on a taxi stand at about 10 to 1 in the morning.  I was just getting off the bus. 
[01:57:00]  You were just getting off the bus?  Yeah, I went to Atlantic City because I got invited to a slot tournament.  I go about once a month because it's something to do.  Slot tournament?  What's a slot tournament?  Uh, you, uh, bring a card, you hand it in, you get taken to a machine, you have seven minutes to play,  and whoever has the 50 highest scores cashes.  I never win.  I only had 4,400.  The lowest score was like 7,000. 
[01:57:30]  I guess it's just luck of the draw.  It's a slot machine.  Yeah, there's no skill involved.  Yeah, so I went down there for it, and then I just hung around.  And I won about $75, so that was nice.  Oh, you're up?  That's my big win.  How does she win?  How does anyone win at the slots?  I don't know.  What do you play, the nickel?  I did the quarter one.  Ooh.  You're living, huh?  You're living.  Sometimes the penny ones I like, you know.  I can't afford to do the others. 
[01:58:00]  Patty, you can't afford to go there.  You should be saving those quarters for food.  Yeah, but if I didn't do that, I'd be sitting home doing nothing.  I don't go anywhere.  I don't really have a social life, so it's just something.  Really?  This is the other side of gambling they don't want you to know about, you know?  This woman needs every penny she can.  These are the kinds of people who show up to the comedy show after they're out of pennies  or nickels and just sitting there with slumped shoulders. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, because they have two hours to kill before the bus takes them back to the city.  Yeah.  You know, I go on the boardwalk, too.  It's the only time I see the ocean.  Jump in it.  No, I just like going there just for something to do, and I like the ocean.  I like the ride down and back.  I don't do very much with the machines.  I like watching the people do the tapes because they look kind of funny to me when they act like when they win and stuff.  Opie's so right.  This is the side they don't want you to see.  They want you to see the glamour, the World Series of Poker with the guys. 
[01:59:00]  Let's bring out the million dollars and put it on the table,  and these last two people are going to be playing for a million dollars cash.  And there's Patty throwing her quarters best spent on food in this slot machine  after taking a stinky bus ride with a bunch of Asians.  I don't have anything better to do.  No, there's a bunch of old people.  Old people.  Yeah, I don't mind it.  I ended up in Vegas with Stephen Lynch's crew when I was just wandering around the country.  I took a ride from L.A. to Vegas through the desert and stuff with a bunch of L.A. dudes 
[01:59:30]  that looked like they were in Stone Temple Pilots.  They all looked like rock stars even though they just worked at like a Starbucks.  And we're there for Stephen Lynch.  He was playing, I guess it was the Hard Rock at the time.  And all of a sudden these guys, I was hanging out with them all week,  and they're like, you want to see the real Vegas?  I'm like, yeah.  Two, maybe three blocks from all the glam and glitter.  Holy shit.  And it's right there.  It's not that far from the strip.  Yeah.  Places where they say they'll accept your car title and your house title for loans. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, shit.  Right off the strip.  Yeah.  Saying, you know, we will accept whatever it is.  Your house.  What is it called?  The house.  And you know, yeah, your deed.  Your deed.  And then there's motels that are for like, I don't know, like $10.  No joke, like $10 a night.  And you've got people just wandering around just like they lost it all.  I like the slot machines and the gas stations.  Like, who can't get away?  You know, you're either, you're leaving, you want to fill up your tank and leave.  Who needs that one last pull or something, you know? 
[02:00:30]  Right.  No, it's even worse if you win because then you're turning your fucking car back.  How are you going, man?  Here we go.  I'm on a streak.  Well, you stay at the gas station.  This machine's hot.  I'm staying here.  Sir, at least move your car away from the pump.  No, I walk away.  I jinx myself.  Yeah, I can't leave.  Keep the car.  I'm up 75.  I don't know how anyone, you know, lives in Vegas.  Because when you go there, you get just pulled into it, obviously.  You really do.  But when you're living there and these slot machines are in grocery stores, the Starbucks, the gas stations, I don't know. 
[02:01:00]  How many times have you gotten a cab driver out there and he's got a story?  Oh, they all do, yep.  Oh, yeah.  They all fucking, oh, yeah.  I stay out of those places.  Everyone that works there is like, no, I don't gamble at all.  I stay away from it.  No drinking.  They're all born-again Christians.  Yeah.  They just go out there.  I think they sold themselves into some sort of slavery out there.  I was going to take the last roll of the dice.  To the cab company.  Yeah, it's some kind of slave labor.  You know, I wasn't going to go there. 
[02:01:30]  I did notice something during Stalker Patty's phone call.  She's still on the line, by the way.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to go there, but the phones are going nuts.  They really are.  There's like five people that have the same comment.  Larry, go ahead.  Hey, did anybody catch what happened there just then?  He said, Eric, that he didn't get on the, he didn't leave the bus the way after one.  Yet, Stalker Patty said she saw him at the taxi stand at 10 to 1.  Patty.  Patty.  Stalker Patty?  Yes.  It was about 10 to 1 because that's when I got off the bus and came up outside and I saw him there. 
[02:02:00]  See, she's crazy.  She knows time.  Yeah, crazy people are like, they know the time all the time.  She knows every time she does everything.  She's like anal like that.  She knows.  So if she says that she saw you at 10 to 1, it was 10 to 1.  Big hole in the story there.  He's like the third person in line.  Did he look happy?  He looked kind of like tired.  That would be the look.  I think he imbibed a little too much. 
[02:02:30]  Imbibed.  Ugh.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Imbibed some arsenic.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Fuck it out.  Thanks, Larry.  So Stalker Patty went down to where Atlantic City and you played the slots in some dumb tournament.  Anything else happen down there?  No, I just had my dinner and just went to the boardwalk, went to my favorite deli because  it's the one with all the dollar bills all over the counter and cash registers.  So it's kind of cool.  So I like to have coffee in there because the place looks cool.  I saw the water and went into some of the 99-cent shops and stuff like that. 
[02:03:00]  This was on TV.  There'd be a sponsorship number underneath her.  Did you hear her?  This is just so sad.  I can't even make fun of her.  This is just sad.  I'm just wandering around the boardwalk all alone.  Money, unaccounted, trading.  Did you hear the last part?  I like it.  She says she walks into the 99-cent stores.  Yeah, they're all over the boardwalk.  They're right there.  Did you buy anything?  Yeah, I just got a little top to keep warm inside the casino because I forgot to bring  something with me.  It was like $4.99, you know. 
[02:03:30]  $4.99 at the 99-cent store.  And did it say anything on it?  Yeah, it just said Atlantic City Athletic Department.  Athletic Department.  She's got the body of an ant.  I was going to say I should have said Atlantic City Ant Farm.  Athletic Department.  Great.  And were you alone?  Yes, I was.  Sitting in that diner with the dollar bills on the counter, drinking her cup of coffee,  just staring off of their thoughts. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, what do you dream about when you're in that situation?  Yeah, what is your mind?  Where does it go?  What if I was one of the lucky ones that hit the jackpot or a thousand or something?  A thousand.  I'm just looking for a grand.  What if the money on the counter was real?  What did I do with the slot tournament?  I got it checked about 8.30 tonight when they're posting it.  I had to run back to Caesars and go look at the list.  Of course, I wasn't on it.  The lowest person was $7,000 and I only hit $44,000.  Patty, do you start thinking about what you would spend the money on? 
[02:04:30]  If I won?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just put it in the bank until I decided what to do.  What is the...  Just take care of something, maybe get a bigger place to live or something.  What's like the one materialistic thing you want?  What is like the dream item that you really want to buy that you'll never think you can afford?  The one item.  Well, I'm already getting it, so I'm happy. 
[02:05:00]  What?  My friend's going to give me his old computer and I'm going to get to watch the dog for about three months free.  You know, when he goes away.  That's not a...  That's a dream item to me.  Can I take a break?  This is like depressing me.  Isn't it depressing?  But it's not depressing to her.  She doesn't understand how sad this is.  To her, this is great.  This segment brought to you by Paxil.  You know, but you know what I would like?  A portable DVD player to watch an interview on a bus or something or sit in Central Park. 
[02:05:30]  Watch a re-run set.  Reruns of the old Lawrence Welk show.  Make it even more depressing.  I'm getting the box set.  Patty, so a portable DVD player?  Yeah, that would be one of my dream items.  That's one of your dream items?  Yeah, but it's like $400 for one and you know you can't spend $400 for one of them.  Patty, we can make your dreams come true.  That's right.  We're the dream makers over here.  There's a new show hitting TV where they make dreams come true. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which, quite frankly, it's bad timing considering what happened with Hurricane Katrina.  And now they're doing these stupid dreams on TV that people are hoping for.  Yeah, the dreams are all small.  I want socks.  Yeah, right.  You know how the dream is to have a, not like a one-room place, but like a two- or three-room apartment.  I can have my study in one room, my bedroom in the other room.  A study.  You know what I mean?  I'm a bigger apartment with these dreams.  I'm a millionaire and I don't have a study. 
[02:06:30]  A study.  All right, Sherlock Holmes.  No.  Who has a study?  Studies?  I believe she's in the study.  Please follow me, sir.  That's what it is.  You've got to open two doors.  Right.  You can never just do the one.  You've got to...  Right.  It's all dark wood in there with books all over.  What would you have?  A fucking raven.  A raven.  A raven.  Yeah, right.  I like reading.  I like reading.  A suit of armor in the corner.  Yeah.  I'm going to teach myself family.  And a buffalo head.  I'm going to come into the study. 
[02:07:00]  What would you have in your study?  Well, I'd move my stereo in there, my little, you know, stuff, you know, my music, whatever.  I'd have my albums all on one wall, you know, all my...  Who are some of your favorite albums?  Yeah.  Like, if you could listen to an album, right?  My Bob Dylan Wands.  They're my treasures.  My treasures.  Or my books would be on another shelf, and I love reading.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, things like that.  What's your favorite book, Patty? 
[02:07:30]  Oh, God.  I like the classics.  I'm embarrassed to say what it is, but I enjoy Five Little Peppers and how they grow.  I enjoy books on, like, sciences and biology and stuff like that.  I like reading a little bit about Isaac Asimov, you know.  Asimov?  Yeah, Asimov.  Isaac Asimov.  Asimov?  He wrote about, like, 200 books on science, behavioral...  Patty's hanging out at the 800th section in the library. 
[02:08:00]  Science fiction.  That's what her study looks like.  Novels.  Well, Patty, what would you do for a DVD player?  Because, Patty, I have a used DVD player.  Used.  To go with your used computer.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, Patty.  What would you do for a DVD player?  Mm-hmm.  Hmm, I don't know.  I'll go down on the beach there and do a well-sticker stop.  Ugh.  No, no, that's not what we'll have in mind. 
[02:08:30]  Why, what would you have in mind?  It has to be something humiliating.  You know that.  She's already trotted around on her hands and knees naked with a Krusty the Clown mask on.  What more could she possibly do?  I know.  She's got to dump that virginity is what she's got to do.  Yeah, if you dump that virginity, you could have my used DVD player.  Did you go out on a date with Big A yet?  No, not yet.  Are you going to? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, we, I do see him sometimes around, you know.  You know, socially, you know, like I see him around.  Do you like the Big A?  He's very nice.  He's a very nice fellow.  Oh, there might be a little love connection.  Ah.  A little action in the study.  What do you think?  What do you think, Patty?  I mean...  Is there a little spark there on your part?  You know, I don't, I don't know.  I mean...  Breaking news for all whack baggers. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Stalker Patty likes Big A.  Ah, start the photoshops.  Start the photoshops.  It was Big A in the study with his cock.  Let's get Big A on the line.  How do we get a hold of Big A today?  Does he listen every day?  Mm-hmm.  I want to see if Big A likes Stalker Patty.  Yeah, I'm sure he's a...  Somebody's got to bring some excitement to this woman's life.  This would be a mess.  There is.  Do you see what excites her?  Sitting in a diner with dollar bills on the counter.  Probably underneath.  What are they, underneath some kind of plastic or something? 
[02:10:00]  Patty?  Yes.  Well, they're hanging up on the wall and everything.  They're kind of shellacked.  And some of them are kind of loose and hanging up.  I asked the guy, you don't think somebody would come in here and go plink, plink, plunk?  And he says, oh, no, never had a problem.  Start stealing dollars.  What does plink, plank, plunk mean?  It's the universal sound of pulling dollars off the wall.  You know, like, maybe somebody might try to take one, but he says, no, they've never had that situation.  If anything, people come in and take one.  Even grabbing money in her world sounds depressing.  Yeah.  Plink, plank, plunk.  And then you sit there and she drinks her coffee and that to her is a real good time. 
[02:10:30]  That's a real good time.  But you make sure you don't miss the bus, right?  Oh, yeah.  I have a certain time because, you know, I've got to work this morning.  You know exactly where you're supposed to be in order to get home so you're not stranded there, right?  Right.  I just stick to a certain bus schedule and that's it.  Tonight I'm going to come home on this one and that's it and I'm there.  It would be real stupid to not know how to get home and be stranded somewhere.  Yeah.  I know.  Well, I'm the type of a person that might have an on-star in my head because no matter where you put me anywhere in the country, in a place I've never been before, I always think to navigate my way back to where I'm going. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Like an ant with a leaf in her mouth.  She knows where the hole is.  All right.  We should get Big A on the phone.  I want to see if there's something going on here.  Mm-hmm.  Because Stalker Patty is kind of leaving the door open.  Like there could be something there.  I mean, I'm open to wall dates.  I really am with anybody because you've got to get to know people and I don't think I know enough people.  You don't. 
[02:11:30]  You don't know anybody.  You know, as far as like attractions or anything, I just don't have any right now.  You're afraid of intimacy.  You've gone 50 years with no attractions.  Stop it.  Just get it over with already.  Have sex.  All right.  We'll have to get Big A on the line here, okay?  Isn't that weird?  She likes hanging out in the diners like that and drinking her coffee.  Brooklyn Diner, this diner in Atlantic City.  And she was left as a child on the counter in a diner.  Isn't that odd? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  When she was an infant, her mother put her in a basket and put her on the counter of a diner and just walked out.  And she was raised.  No wonder she reads the classics.  That sounds like the beginning of.  I know.  And she was raised.  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  She was raised in the foundling home.  Foundling home.  She was a foundling.  Doesn't that sound like something out of The Little Rascals?  Yeah, I know.  Who has a foundling home? 
[02:12:30]  Apparently New York does.  All right, Patty.  Well, someone's on the hotline.  Who's on the hotline?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Who's on 11?  Who's this?  You're working in there.  Hello, 11?  Line 11?  Hello?  Come in 11.  11?  Hello?  Anyone there?  K to K12 to K to K1.  All right.  I don't know what's going on.  Okay.  I guess we could take a break and then regroup then.  See if they can get to Big A.  The Big A? 
[02:13:00]  I saw him outside the building like twice so far.  That's not to do missing the toe, is it?  Right, Derek?  No, that's Pat from Monaki.  Pat from Monaki is so old.  His 15 minutes ran up.  Our new guy is Big A.  Big A.  Andrew.  He's a very big guy, a little scary.  And he drives a taxi.  It's not even a taxi.  It's like he took his car and he just drives around picking people up, up in the Bronx.  And that's what he does.  And he gets very nervous and he's got kind of a speech problem. 
[02:13:30]  So he kind of stutters a little, but in between him trying to find the words.  I know.  They just fucking call in.  In between trying to find his words, he goes like, Willow, drive.  And this is a step.  And Sturker Patty's interested.  And he has problems with words that start with S-T.  He'll go like, I was walking up the stairs. 
[02:14:00]  It's just frightening.  This is how we discovered him.  He was outside the station one day.  We were doing something.  Oh, we have a clip?  Yeah, this is the first time he was ever on our show.  All of a sudden we just talked to the guy.  Listen to this.  You going on the ride today?  Actually, I just came down here to take some photos of everybody and to post on whackbag.com.  How come you're not going on the ride?  I didn't plan it. 
[02:14:30]  I don't know who I could, you know, take along, but I'm just hanging out.  Jesus Christ.  Fill in their date.  You'll win like a prize at an independent film festival.  Those actors were brilliant.  So believable.  Winning awards at Sundance this year. 
[02:15:00]  I love you.  All right, here we go.  We stalled enough.  We got Big A on the line.  Big A.  Yes.  Hey, Big A. What's going on?  Where are you right now?  I'm on 62nd and Central Park West.  Are you having trouble getting around the city with the U.N. thing happening?  Not too much.  No, because you keep it uptown, right?  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  What are you...  That car you drive doesn't look like it belongs to any company or anything.  Right.  And you're kind of scary looking.  I mean, who the hell is going...  Who the hell is taking a ride from you?  Anybody who calls Target.  I mean, my company.  It actually...  It's a company?  A real company?  Yeah, it is a real company, yes.  And you had to buy the car yourself?  No, it's a company car, actually.  Wow.  You know what he looks like, by the way? 
[02:16:00]  I don't want to know.  Remember when Danny DeVito played the penguin in Batman?  Oh, a little bit.  A little bit.  That's exactly what he looks like, man.  I've got to go.  I have to get ready while I'm on the phone.  Stalker Patty, what's going on?  Stalker Patty.  Yes.  Do you have to go?  No, no, no.  All right.  I'm just getting ready to walk out the door.  I got ready while I was on the phone.  All right.  Big A.  Yes.  We just want to know if you might have a little interest in Stalker Patty. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  I do, actually.  He's very nice.  Were you two hanging out at the B.B. King's appearance?  Yeah, I saw her at the B.B. King's, and I had breakfast with her yesterday at the Brooklyn  Diner.  Oh, you had breakfast with her at the Brooklyn Diner yesterday.  Oh, something's good.  That's funny.  A little sunshine here.  Yeah, that's nice.  Now, Stalker Patty's a 50-year-old virgin. 
[02:17:00]  Big A, we never asked how old you were.  Um, I'm 38.  38.  Patty, younger man, huh?  Wow.  Patty's got a boy toy.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Well, I'm not Cher, so I don't believe in boy toys.  All right.  Well, Big A, are you going to pop the question and ask her out on a real date, or what?  Um, um, Patty, would you like to go out sometime? 
[02:17:30]  Sure, I'd be happy to go on a date with you.  We've got a lot of connection.  Yeah, go out on a date.  This is big news for the show, you guys.  Huge news.  Now, Big A.  Yes.  Where would you be taking the likes of Stalker Patty for a date?  Um, take it to a diner.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, where? 
[02:18:00]  You want to go to Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy?  Oh.  Oh, definitely, yeah.  How about that?  The San Gennaro feast is going on, I do believe.  They're closing down all the streets down there.  That's right.  You can have a nice, some nice Italian food.  Hey, Big A, when was the last time you got laid, by the way?  Um, about two years ago, at least.  Stalker Patty, are you all right with that?  His, uh, sexual history?  Sounds like a slut to me. 
[02:18:30]  Are you having something with someone so experienced?  I'm really down for a date.  Yes, excuse me.  I'm out in the hallway getting on the elevator.  The hallway of what, Rikers?  No, they're just fixing something in the hallway.  The elevator's here.  It'll be quieter in a second.  What is that banging?  There's that thing coming up the stairs.  Yeah.  Fixing something around the corner in the hallway.  I'm showing Bill Burr what Big A looks like. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm leaving.  Does that double chin quiver when he goes, uh, yes, it does.  He looks happy, though.  He's a happy guy.  He was waving to all his fans as he was going into the B.B. King's appearance, the Rana Fez thing.  That picture's cropped too much, though.  It doesn't show the sweat under that armpit that he's holding up.  Right, right.  You were a little nervous that day.  I noticed you sweating a lot, Big A.  All right, breaking news on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Big A has asked Stalker Patty out on a date. 
[02:19:30]  Do we have a, uh, uh, a day we can do this to send them to Paisanos of Mulberry Street?  Stalker Patty, would you, well, Big A, you better ask her.  I can't do the dirty work for you.  Yeah, get to know when she's free and everything.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hey, Patty, um, uh, this is a good thing, you know, so I can take you out at Paisanos.  That would be nice.  I'm free any time.  Just let me know when. 
[02:20:00]  Uh, no problem.  I'll call you on your cell phone.  Close the deal, man.  Get a date.  Yeah, close the deal.  Let's go.  Yeah, what day?  What day, man?  And call her Stalker Patty.  That's her real name, as far as the show goes.  I loved this scene when it was in The Other Sister.  How about on Thursday, my day off?  Okay.  Sounds good, huh?  We'll do a Thursday.  What time?  What time?  Yeah, what time?  Well, what time would you like me to be there or meet you? 
[02:20:30]  Four o'clock.  Five o'clock would be fine.  Four, for a date, a dinner date of four o'clock?  Four o'clock.  That's a lot of time.  Four o'clock, you're going into dinner hour anyway.  We're both yapping over each other.  Could you guys come in Thursday, the day of your date?  Sure.  Both of you guys come in Thursday in studio? 
[02:21:00]  Of course we can.  But it looks like we have a date.  Big A is going to go out with Stalker Patty this Thursday at Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  You want us to bring a chaperone to maybe get some audio?  We're going to need a chaperone, you know, just for a little while, and then we'll let you two love birds, you know, have some fun.  All right.  All right.  This is going to be the most horrific thing to happen in an Italian restaurant since Michael shot Salazzo in the bus bus game. 
[02:21:30]  What do I want to let Nathaniel go with?  I'm going to record it.  Nathaniel, you want in?  All right, Nathaniel's going to chaperone the big date between Big A and Stalker Patty.  Oh, yeah.  We need the camera to go.  We should duct tape some condoms up behind the toilet for him to go into at the end of the day.  Can I use the bathroom?  Why not?  Big A, any final words to Stalker Patty?  Um, I guess I'll see you on Thursday. 
[02:22:00]  Okay, no problem.  Just give me a call.  Okay, I'll see you there at the studio.  Okay.  Are we going to meet here?  Are we going to supply him with transportation and stuff?  Oh, fuck no.  Oh, come on.  We'll get him a free dinner.  I'm sure Joey will give him a free meal.  Joey will hook him up.  But what, are they going to take a cab down there?  Yeah.  And then, uh, wait a minute.  What about the video?  I'll pay for that cab.  Wow.  Hey, Bill. 
[02:22:30]  There you go, huh?  Now, I would like for Than, if Than's going, if we could have them in the back of the cab, right?  Get in here, Nathaniel.  Nathaniel?  How about we get...  He's a big responsibility.  Can we pay one of those bike guys to bike him down?  That's a long bike ride.  What are they called?  Jesus Christ, they don't go that far.  What are they called?  Rim, rim, rim?  Oh, yeah, one of those rickshaw guys.  Rickshaw.  Yeah.  No, that's too far.  Why not?  It's kind of romantic.  Romantic from here to there.  Yeah.  You can talk. 
[02:23:00]  Nathaniel's in studio, Ann.  I was thinking, Nathaniel, if you take a cab with these guys, you're going to have to  sit in the front seat.  Okay.  And turn the camera around so it looks like taxi cab confessions a little bit.  Okay.  And just have them two sitting in the back seat so you're not there kind of mixing things  up.  And just get their natural taxi cab conversations.  Okay.  Right.  Sounds good.  Yeah.  All right.  So here's the deal.  Nathaniel will shout out on Big Gang Installer.  Yeah.  I didn't call you in, friend.  I knew you.  All right.  Well, I thought he might have something else to add to the goddamn thing.  It'll be funny. 
[02:23:30]  There.  I added.  Good idea.  Thank you, sir.  And they'll come in studio Thursday morning so we can set up the date a little bit.  And later that night, they'll go down to Paisano and Mulberry Street in the heart of  Little Italy.  All right?  All right, guys.  Hi.  Hi.  Hello?  Yeah.  Great.  All right.  Have fun.  We'll see you Thursday.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Take care, everyone.  See you Thursday.  All right.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  Big A.  That guy's Radio Gold, I'm telling you right now. 
[02:24:00]  And Stalker Patty, who has been Radio Gold for many years for us.  This just in.  Paisano's standing room only this Thursday.  I'm sure a few listeners will probably go down there and join them for their romantic  little meal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now they know the time, the place, the date.  It's going to turn into an open-ended.  We won't be able to get a reservation.  Fucker!  All right.  You're going to hear.  All right.  Yeah.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  He's going to turn into the accused.  He's going to fuck him right there. 
[02:24:30]  He's going to fuck him.  Hey, frat boy, you're next.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  The San Gennaro feast is going on, I believe.  It's one of the best times of the year to go down there.  The fall of Little Italy.  It's a great combination.  That's right.  And you know how crowded it is down there?  You walk down the street.  It's very crowded.  You go into Paisano.  You'll sit out on the sidewalk, all the room you want at your table as you watch.  The people walk by.  There's only one thing I don't like about it. 
[02:25:00]  What?  The restaurants are all the way on one side.  And then to get to these restaurants, you've got to go through the thing where the guys are,  Hey, you want to throw some darts for the sweetheart?  Come on.  Come on.  Get her a flower.  Win her a stuffed animal.  Oh, you don't want to buy her a rose?  Yeah.  I got my little story about the San Gennaro.  I'll do it quickly for the people that heard it already.  I went down there.  I'm going to have some fun.  I got games and stuff.  It's a bunch of these big Italian guys.  Hey, you know, it's San Gennaro.  So it was this booth where you threw darts and you had to pop three balloons with three 
[02:25:30]  darts to win a prize.  I was on a dart league at the time.  The darts they give you are pretty shitty, but I shoot darts pretty well.  Well, they don't have any sharp edges and the balloons aren't inflated enough.  The guy's going, Hey, you want to try?  I go, No, that's all right.  He goes, No, yeah, you're on the house.  Just give it a try.  Just try it.  I'm like, All right.  I throw three darts and I popped like two balloons, one bounced off. 
[02:26:00]  He goes, Try it again.  Come on.  You're good.  So he kept doing it under the guise that it was free.  When I go to walk away, he's like, Hey, hey, hey, 30 bucks.  He's like, Wait, they were on the house.  You kept handing them to me.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  On the house.  It was a business over here.  What do you think?  What do you think?  The guy shook me down.  And if I try to walk away, forget about it.  That would have cracked my head open.  I'm like, Thanks a lot, Paisan.  A fucking guy, huh?  Totally raped me.  I did the same thing with the basketball thing. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  I punched a guy in Buffalo.  He goes, Oh, hey, hey, I don't want any problems.  I don't want any problems.  Buffalo, not Little Italy.  I understand.  He gave me my money back and I left.  Wow, did you see what just happened there?  Probably just topped your story.  He was a little more manly.  I know.  Well, no, it's a true story.  I'm a pussy.  I know.  What am I going to say?  Well, it was a girl.  I wish to go apologize to Opie.  Yeah.  It was a girl I was seeing at the time who was in a horrific car accident.  Horrific.  Broke both legs. 
[02:27:00]  And, yeah.  I was right on.  I did it to myself.  That's horrific.  Broke both legs.  That's horrific.  Really bad.  And she was basically in a hospital.  And recuperating at home for almost a year.  It was that bad.  And she's finally getting out and about again.  And I take her to one of these dumb festivals they have in Buffalo, right?  And she's crutching along.  And one of these scumbags, they have no heart, right?  All of a sudden, they just see her. 
[02:27:30]  Like, she's the injured gazelle.  And gives her some, I forgot if it was basketballs or the dumb darts.  But the same type of thing.  Like, hey, sweetheart, oh, you're injured, you know?  And to make a long story short, she's starting to shoot the baskets and stuff.  Same thing.  He wants money out of me.  And it's like $30, $25 after you're done.  And they do it under the guys that, you know, it's a little slow.  You know, throw a few for free, just for fun.  And I'm trying to remember the exact details. 
[02:28:00]  I do remember I did punch him in the face because he was insisting that I owed him money.  And I go, you scumbag.  And he's like, no, no, you know, $30 or whatever it was.  This goes back at least 12 years.  So I fucking punched the guy hard.  He goes, hey, hey, I don't want any problems, you know, and then let us move on.  But now Giuliani cleaned it up down there, by the way.  And you won't find that scammage going on anymore.  That's for sure.  Right.  Well, it's Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Joey's been with us for many, many years.  It's a great restaurant. 
[02:28:30]  I've been there, I don't know, close to 100 times easily.  Yep.  Anthony, the same thing.  Love it.  I think I'm going to go down there very, very soon, actually.  Thursday?  Maybe Thursday.  Maybe Thursday we should pop down there and check it out.  Great Italian cuisine, Anthony.  Every single pasta on the menu is now under $10.  Paisano, you go in there.  If Joey's not there, just tell anyone in there that you heard about Paisano's from XM and Opie and Anthony,  and they'll give you a free glass of wine, okay?  Yep.  That's a guarantee.  It's open weekends until 2 a.m. 
[02:29:00]  You can sit out on the sidewalk.  People watch.  It's a great spot.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy between Grant and Hester.  Call 212-965-1188.  That's 212-965-1188.  I know a lot of people that are listening from all over the country, but you're going to be in New York one of these days.  Go down there and check it out, okay?  Everyone.  Joey likes to hear from the people that are out of town and heard about this from some faraway land.  And this Thursday, it's the place that Big A is taking Stalker Patty for their first date. 
[02:29:30]  First date?  For their first date.  All right.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Yes, Ben?  Dane is here.  Oh, cool.  Dane Cook's here.  He's going to join the festivities next.  Now, what we should do as we go to break, Jim Norton is out in L.A.  Bill Burr sitting in doing an unbelievable job.  We're very happy that Bill's sitting in.  Don't forget to watch Bill tonight on HBO, his half-hour comedy special.  It's at midnight tonight.  But Jimmy is filming an HBO series, and we're trying to keep tabs on Jimmy. 
[02:30:00]  He's going to be calling the program a lot as he goes through this whole process.  And he'll be back on the show in a couple weeks for a week, and then he goes out there for another couple weeks.  It's a whole complicated thing that's going on.  But he called yesterday.  That's the point.  Yes, he did.  Poor guy.  Just in case, because people listen to the show at all different times.  He called very early yesterday to give us our first update.  If you remember, he was very happy.  He was going out to L.A.  He had an apartment all set that his manager got him, and he was ready for the first table read for the HBO series. 
[02:30:30]  He went out there early because Rich Voss is getting married in Canada.  It was a whole thing.  So Jimmy called the program yesterday, and just in case you missed it, here it is.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Hey, we've got to say hi to Jim Norton.  Jimmy!  Isn't that like midnight in Los Angeles?  What time is it?  It's 4.12 in L.A.  Oh, yeah, a little bit after 4.  I've got to go to bed because I've got to get up.  I had to leave the apartment that I was staying in, though.  Why?  Dude, this whole trip has been just a fucking disaster. 
[02:31:00]  Of course it has.  Oh, Jimmy.  Sounds flustered.  Before I leave, the last thing I said, all right, let me treat myself.  I'll go out.  I'll get a girl.  This is in New York.  She was recommended to me by a federal police officer.  He said she's great because she has a big clit.  I get there.  She's about 270 pounds.  I'm like, all right, let me just see.  Maybe I'll do it and make the most of it because I'm leaving.  We're making out.  She tells me I shouldn't touch her back because she has Ben Gay on her back.  Yeah.  Because she has really heavy tits.  So she's got Ben Gay on her back. 
[02:31:30]  And then she stands up and she shows me she has fat feet.  And she says she has legadermia.  Legadermia?  Which is kind of like what Hillary has, I think, where they get fat feet.  And the ankle goes right, the foot goes right into the calf.  Yeah, it's where, like, water collects.  She's like, yeah, water collects.  I've got to get that fixed.  So my fucking, before I leave, it's a disaster.  I get here.  The apartment is roach infested.  I've got roaches in my apartment.  Now, this is the apartment that you've rented for how long?  It's five months.  Five months.  You went, you looked at it.  I remember you were very excited about it in Hollywood. 
[02:32:00]  But I didn't look.  My managers looked at this one because the one we wanted to look at was too much money.  They lied about the price.  It was too much money.  So this one, we accepted.  I kind of signed for it without seeing.  Oh, no.  It was fine.  And I come back.  I got pictures.  I got video.  There's fucking roaches.  It was infested with cockroaches.  They were in the bedroom with the lights on.  Holy shit.  Get out of here.  Are you kidding?  Dude, everything is booked in L.A. because the stupid Microsoft convention and the Emmys 
[02:32:30]  coming up.  So every hotel is booked.  I had to go into Beverly Hills.  My manager got me a deal in a hotel for two nights.  I have nowhere to stay out here.  So I have nowhere to stay in L.A.  Homeless little Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm sure I won't be homeless.  But so far, the trip has been an abortion.  And I haven't even gone to the studio yet.  What are you going to do about living arrangements, though?  I don't know.  You've got two days.  What's that?  You've got two days.  Dude, I know you're going to go to Stupid's Wedding in fucking Edmonton.  The Rich Foss's Wedding. 
[02:33:00]  And I'm flying Northwest, which is declaring bankruptcy.  And I've had a maintenance strike for a month.  I'm never coming back.  Now, let me tell you.  This is coming from Jimmy Norton, who only flies Continental because, as he's told everybody,  Youngest Fleet.  Yep.  They are not in bankruptcy.  Yep.  They do very well.  And he's very confident with flying that airline.  Only one of two airlines is not in bankruptcy.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Actually, Jim, they laid off 3,000 mechanics and they replaced them with 1,000.  Who did?  Northwest. 
[02:33:30]  Northwest.  Oh, okay.  That's comforting.  At least they only cut their mechanic by two-thirds.  That's fine.  That's acceptable.  They just got three times the work, man.  Three times the work.  And they're going to go in with a smile and make sure everything's taken care of.  Of course, because none of their friends got fired.  Oh.  I'm sure they'll still do their job.  Look, my options were either that or Alaska Air, which I won't fly.  Oh, boy.  They have that fucking, it looks like Steve C. on the side of the plane.  Yeah, it's a big, it's Steve on the tail. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, that big, you know, the cockpit recorder goes, windshear, windshear.  Pull up, pull up, pull up.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:34:30]  Thanks for checking us out.  It's a virus, the ONA virus spreading across America slowly but surely,  getting more gooder every day, I've got to tell you.  More gooder.  More gooder.  Let me set the table here.  Jim Norton's out in Hollywood being a star.  Bill Burr is.  In his cockroach infested apartment.  Right, Bill Burr is sitting in and doing quite well for us.  He's going to be on HBO tonight.  His half-hour comedy special is at midnight.  We want to just push that a lot. 
[02:35:00]  We want a lot of people to check that out tonight.  And now, joining the program, Dane Cook.  All right, yeah.  Yeah.  First time in studio.  I like that applause break off the bat.  And I'm just here, listen, I'm going to shave my crotch and then I've got to go.  That would work.  First time in studio.  First time in studio next to Billy Burr, who, Jesus, man, we've done a lot of gigs together.  Yeah?  But I've got to say, one of my favorite Bill Burr stories.  Do you remember the time you got the buttered biscuit?  Do you remember the buttered biscuit? 
[02:35:30]  Will you tell that, please?  I don't even remember.  I was in, like, fucking Lee, Massachusetts.  Doing some fucking horrific gig.  And it was one of those deals where it was like a restaurant and there was a function room to the right.  It was like some sort of bachelor party was going on.  And I'm standing there in front of, like, eight people going, eh, what's up with Dan Quayle?  Just eating my balls.  And all of a sudden, I just look over and I see, like, these three fucking evil high school football player looking guys just standing there. 
[02:36:00]  And I didn't get what was going on.  I'm like, guys, there's plenty of seats.  Plenty of seats.  And I'm just fucking standing there.  And all of a sudden, in the middle of one of my jokes, this fucking dinner roll comes in at about at least Mach 4.  Bangs off my forehead.  And then, pow, against the back wall.  And I'm fucking dazed.  And I turn.  All those guys are gone.  Just sitting there. 
[02:36:30]  I got, like, a welt from a dinner roll.  It was a fresh one, too.  That's how fucking hard this got through.  But it was the butter side that hit you, too.  I remember it was just this butter, muscle side of man.  Nobody does anything.  Nobody who's running the restaurant does a fucking thing.  And I spent, like, another ten minutes sitting there with butter on the side of my face.  And I'm like, how long do you think they sat there going, dude, I'm going to throw a fucking roll at his head?  Oh, at that point, I think everybody was thinking of different things they could throw for the rest of the show.  So I'm on the gig.  And then Alan the Monkees, me, Robert Kelly, and a couple of other guys were in this comedy group. 
[02:37:00]  We had to go up later that night.  And remember, there was a magician, Jeff Apotheca, who did magic at the time.  Masters of Ceremony.  Jeff Apotheca.  That was his outgoing message, calling this guy for gigs.  You have reached Masters of Ceremony.  And he's fucking Lee, Massachusetts, like he's fucking Billy Graham.  But he had, like, a bedazzled jacket.  And so he's got all his stuff set up, like, previously on stage, like, in all these cards, you know, giant Joker cards. 
[02:37:30]  You remember Bobby just goes up on stage.  And because Bobby's set wasn't going great, he just starts picking up this guy's acting.  Oh, shit.  He's pulling the shit out.  He's like, oh, there's a fake dove in here.  And this guy's just standing there watching Bobby.  And this is the exact quote.  You see the color leave his face, and he goes, my illusions.  My illusions.  My illusions.  That night was the first three, three and a half years of our fucking career. 
[02:38:00]  Every night, running into him in one impossible situation.  The fucking Belrican 99s.  We're standing up there.  They're, like, shutting off the Bruins playoff game.  Okay, you guys ready for some calling?  Oh, no.  Don't fucking get it.  Put the game on.  It was better when they would leave a game on for us, but, like, turn the sound down.  So it would just be, like, you're set going all the time you hear, come on!  Yeah.  Come on! 
[02:38:30]  Me and my brother used to do acoustic gigs out in Huntington.  And they would do that during the Islander games.  And they'd turn the sound down.  And you're playing.  And sometimes it would coincide right when you finish a song.  Something would happen to you and you'd hear, yeah!  And you're thinking, wow, we did great.  And then you look and realize it's just a fucking television.  And you stink.  And no one wants you there.  You nailed it because I had to do a gig.  Robbie Krieger was playing at a stupid rock club.  Probably the same rock club you played at.  Yeah.  One of those, you know, tiny, tiny little...  Yeah.  It's Robbie Krieger from the door. 
[02:39:00]  Robbie Krieger.  There's that shithole in Long Beach, I think, right?  I forgot the name of it.  Whatever.  So I'm the DJ.  I've got to, like, do the whole thing, you know, hand out bumper stickers and say, hey,  everybody, Robbie Krieger.  And the place maybe fit a hundred people, maybe.  And they had an Islander game on.  You guys nailed this.  And they wouldn't turn the sound down even for Robbie Krieger.  It's Robbie fucking Krieger.  I mean, they turned it down, but you can still hear the game.  And people are playing pool, and, you know, I'm going to say the exact same thing you did,  but, yeah, during these, you know, he's just playing, without Jim Morrison singing, 
[02:39:30]  obviously, just the great guitar riffs, and people are screaming, you know, for the Islander game.  What is going through his head at that moment?  Right?  Right?  I was in the fucking doors, man.  Hollywood Bowl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking rock that place.  And now people are screaming for the Islanders as he's playing, you know, Spanish Caravan.  You ever seen a show?  I'm thinking it's Stephen Wright.  You ever seen a show at the Bowl?  Have you seen a show at the Hollywood Bowl?  It's basically like a great show until 9.20, and then there's like this ordinance that  they have to turn the fucking volume down to like four. 
[02:40:00]  So like mid-show Aerosmith, you're like, this is great.  And then it's just like, whoop, goes all the way down.  Because the neighbors have this thing at 9.20.  You can't, they can't crank the music anymore.  Oh, that sucks.  That's the worst combo I think ever.  Comedy and music.  And everybody always tries to get those shows together, where it's like, yeah, it's going  to be, back in the day, yeah, you're going to open, and, you know,  you know, Juice Newton's going to come out and do 22 Minutes.  What?  That'll be great.  Nobody's there to see me.  They're here for Juice. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Speaking of, that's a tough gig opening for a rock band.  I was going to say, speaking of music and comedy, the VMAs.  Yeah.  We've got to get into that a little bit.  Dane Cook, they gave you, what, three or four minutes?  Yeah, it was like two minutes.  Two minutes?  And it was two and a half hours into, I mean, that was like a blitz, man, coming at you.  That was just, I was backstage, they had me back with Snoop waiting to go out, and they  were like, the guy's pushing me, one of the union guys was like, you've got to stand right  here, stand right here. 
[02:41:00]  And I'm literally up against electricity.  Everything is just like wires and all the backs of the stage, and then I hear, hit the  water, because that was the theme, electricity and water.  And there's water dripping on me.  Before my set, I'm like, I'm getting rained on as I'm leaning on all the wires that are  like right around my head.  What are you thinking?  Are you like, are you thinking, like, this is, I'm going to kill, or are you like, this  is just fucking horrendous?  Okay, so first of all, there's fireballs going off during everybody's performance.  You've got rappers that are threatening each other, and Suge had been shot the night before. 
[02:41:30]  A guy with a hooded sweatshirt shot Suge Knight, and so all this stuff's happening, and they  got monsoons, and I'm standing there like, I've got two jokes, and that's about it.  I'm like, can I have a sparkler?  I'll stick it in my ass, I don't care.  Just give me something, you know, body paint.  So it really was one of those things where I was like, either just go out there and just,  you know, talk about the show.  So I really kind of wish I'd go on my first instinct, because I went out there and just  ended up playing for the camera, but I wanted to go out there and say, you know what, fuck 
[02:42:00]  you, 50 Cent, fuck you, Fat Joe, I'm in this thing now, and just like try to get involved  in their beef.  But it was just like, go out, do it, and get the hell out of there, man.  That was wild.  And Bill, you were saying, what, Kelly Clarkson was right before him?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Screeching in that shower.  That's what I knew, because I knew he was going to be on.  I started out, I'm going to want to see Dane on this thing.  It's going to be fucking great.  And like, two minutes into the show, I'm like, oh, this is going to be, this is horrifying.  It was just like, everybody, half the fucking girls that can't even sing, so they have to 
[02:42:30]  add all this extra, they like lower them from ceilings.  They're coming out with animals and shit.  They think if you excite their visual sense, that your audio sense won't pick up on the  fact that they stink.  Mariah Carey, who can sing, is standing there like a, in this pool, and she's got backup dancers  who did a backflip into a pool and started dancing underwater with this underwater camera.  And then like, we've got comedian Dane Cook coming on, like, oh, dude, this is going to  be fucking horrific. 
[02:43:00]  And everybody right around the front, like all these kids, they were flipping out.  And I just remember at one point, sometimes you just see random stuff during your set where  you're like, you're trying to, you're in your head, you're trying to figure out, and I looked  down and there was a kid just smacking his own face.  I'm like, I don't know if he's on E or, and this is just like the new way to class, but  he's like, he's just staring at me, he's like, yeah!  And he's smacking himself over and over.  He's like, in the face!  Hit me in the face!  Isn't that great when you're not looking at the, because everyone assumes you're looking  at the big picture, and a lot of people say, oh, the lights are in their eyes, so you really 
[02:43:30]  don't see the crowd.  There are some times you do just pick out one person or one event that's going on, a fight,  a conversation, and even though you're going through the motions and you're saying or you're  singing or you're doing whatever you do up there, you're thinking, what the fuck is  going on out there?  And it never comes across on stage because you're a professional, you're doing what you do,  but you're looking and going, that is the most fucked up thing I've ever seen, and this  should really distract me.  I did a college gig a couple months ago, and there was a girl in the front row, I swear 
[02:44:00]  to God, this girl looked 14, but she's showing her titties during the show, and it was like,  it was great because it was titties, but I'm like, this girl's like literally 14 years  old.  She's like the Doogie Howser of this college, and she was just like, she was advanced from  8th grade to like...  Cake parties.  In every way, apparently, yes.  Wow, that's funny.  You guys all have nightmare stories, though.  I haven't seen one comic that went, every gig's been gold since I started. 
[02:44:30]  There's always a fucking nightmare or eight.  And it never ends either.  No, huh?  Even if you keep doing college gigs, it never ends.  Yeah.  It never ends.  Did Bobby ever tell you the Boston Garden gig when we played the, we did the Rock of  Boston show back when they were doing that every year?  It was the biggest bomb gig we'd ever done.  And Bobby was probably so psyched.  Oh, Bobby was, I mean, he was, it was the group again.  We were doing this, you know, every year they did the Rock of Boston, and they're like,  we're going to put you on, again, music and comedy.  You're going to be on right before Fish. 
[02:45:00]  It's two hours into the show.  It was like, Extreme's going to go on.  And you...  I was actually in the, in the crowd for that.  I don't even know why.  No, you're always at the worst possible situation.  I put it.  He was like, I'm going to tune in.  I'm like, don't fucking tune in, Burr.  When Billy says I'm going to be at the gig or tune in, I know I'm in trouble.  That was early on.  I didn't, no, I was like everyone else.  I was going there for the music.  And then I, I already had, I already had tickets.  At least he's being honest.  No, I didn't know that they were going to be on that. 
[02:45:30]  And then all of a sudden it was just like, yeah, dude, we're going to be doing that.  So literally, it was one another thing, two minutes into the show, I'm like, how the  fuck are they going to do like, there's like 20,000 people there.  Oh, man.  We're like this improv group.  They bring us out, okay?  And when they first announced that we were going to go out and, you know, and perform,  people didn't know we were comedy.  I think they thought we were like an acapella group.  So at first everyone's like, ah, and we're like, we've arrived, man.  They really care.  So we get out there.  We've got these awful lapel mics on.  There's four of us.  And I'll never forget, Bobby's up there. 
[02:46:00]  And Bobby goes up to the mic and he's like, yeah, we're going to do some improv.  We're going to blah, blah, blah.  And it's just, it's the garden.  So the sound is awful.  It's just echoing.  You can't hear anything anyone's saying.  Nothing.  And about a minute in, you feel the entire, like you feel people looking at each other  going, you're not going to sing.  They're like trying to do comedy.  And I'm telling you, it was like three, two, one.  And all of a sudden, lighters, a million lighters just came like whipping, lighters in shoes. 
[02:46:30]  People sacrificing their shoes.  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm like, I'm getting pelted with lighters, but I'm like, did they bring extra shoes to throw?  Or are they so angry that they don't even care they're going to be walking home without shoes?  I mean, upper deck shit, littering.  Wow.  You guys were in that kung fu bit.  And Al would stand up.  He remembers the picture.  He was doing the voices.  And they're like, ha, I will kill you now. 
[02:47:00]  And, you know, we're acting out.  And they were acting out with somebody else doing the sound.  Oh, no.  And so we're getting hit and all this stuff.  And then finally, you know, we're hitting Sha-na-na-na, right?  At that point, right?  It's, you know, hey, hey, goodbye.  Hey, hey, hey, goodbye.  Yep.  Bobby goes up to the mic, and he's like, I want to say something.  Something, something.  Oh, no.  And they actually shut up.  The whole crowd, like, stops.  And I'm like, Bobby's my hero at this point, right?  I'm staring at this kid.  He's got his long, Rico Suave hair down to his fucking asshole, right?  He's looking like Crystal Gale.  And he's like, I want to say something right now. 
[02:47:30]  And then everyone shows up and he goes, we didn't come here to ruin your night.  Oh, no, we didn't.  And he starts to, you know, Bobby starts getting, like, defensive.  Yeah.  And then he goes, like, as he goes, and we're going to leave.  And, of course, they're like, yeah.  And he goes, after the next two skits that we're here to do, and it was, like, more lighters  and shoes.  Holy shit.  What a nightmare.  Wow.  A set of balls walking up to the mic like that.  Oh, no.  That is really fun.  Oh, and it's, like, home turf for him.  No more music and comedy, please.  No, especially, like, a fish show. 
[02:48:00]  Just laid back.  And comedy, and especially improv comedy, you need the crowd to be focused on you.  Yeah, you don't want to do it in front of a bunch of potheads.  Like, you can't get a concert crowd to pay attention all at once to the band that they  were there seeing.  They're talking, they're smoking, they're doing whatever the fuck they do.  For comedy, it's like, unless you have a huge portion of that audience focused on you,  you're done.  No, we're asking them, we're, like, we need an appliance, and, like, millions of people  are, like, we can't even, I think I heard, I think I heard a microwave. 
[02:48:30]  I think I heard, it's like, I think I heard a thousand people yelling shit at us right  now.  We, ugh, clusterfuck.  Yeah.  But these are the gigs, gentlemen, then.  Yeah.  Build your character.  Now you're playing the garden there, Dane Cook.  Last night, show number one at the, uh.  Oh, how was it?  It was, it was amazing.  Yeah.  I think that tonight is, we get two tonight, and it's just going to be.  Was that the biggest show of your life, you think?  Uh, no, it was, uh, we did the tour, guys, and tour, and we did some pretty big venues  there.  Yeah.  And I did that Gator Graw last year, which was, uh, 50,000. 
[02:49:00]  I don't know if you've done that.  That's pretty, that's pretty cool.  Um.  What's your audience made up of a lot?  A lot of.  Yeah, it's pretty mixed up.  I mean, it's definitely that college, uh, college core.  But, no, I look out, and it's, uh, it seems to be all over the board.  Yeah, you got a lot of chicks, though, that, like, want to fuck you and things like that.  A lot of girls.  Yeah, they wear t-shirts with my joke, which is really great, because, like, half the time  I'm just kind of going off the cuff anyway, so I'll look down, I'll, I'll see titties  with, like, fuck bees on it, and I'm like, oh, I'll do that next.  That's pretty cool.  Some 14-year-old girl hasn't lifted it up yet. 
[02:49:30]  Hey, let's, uh, say hi to Ryan in New Jersey.  Saw Dane Cook last night.  Ryan, what's up?  What's up, dude?  Dane, man, you fucking ruled last night.  Hey, thanks a lot, man.  Thanks for coming out, dude.  Yeah, dude, Bob Kelly ruled, too.  Uh, my girlfriend doesn't even like O&A and none of that shit, but last night, man, she  fucking loved Kelly, loved you, and now I think she's an O&A fan.  Oh, that's cool.  Oh, that's good.  Good deal, man.  It's hard to get the girls on, but see, you, you, you got it knocked.  You know, the girls are there with you.  You got a very, uh, diverse crowd. 
[02:50:00]  Us, it's a cock fest.  It's just like, yeah, fucking A, guys, and the girls, they hate it, and I don't know,  what we're doing.  We're trying to soften our delivery a little bit so we can have more women out there.  Yeah, that's what I think.  It's not working at all.  Let's bring some girls down to the studio.  We're going to do hugs.  We're going to do free hugs every hour.  Come on down.  Well, we noticed since Jimmy's been gone the past couple of days, girls have warmed up  to us a little bit.  That's right.  We had girls in the studio that were willing to take all their clothes off, which is always  a good thing.  A girl called up to play Guess What's in My Pants.  Jimmy scares girls. 
[02:50:30]  We had a strap-on show the other day.  Jimmy scares girls away.  They walk in, and he looks like he's going to be a problem.  He looks like no matter what they do, he's going to want to go one step more than they're  willing to go.  Like, they could want to take that, like the girl the other day.  They came in completely naked, took that wiffle ball bat right up there, lubed it up, and  stuck it right inside them, and we measured how deep it went.  Everything fine.  With Jimmy, they're probably thinking, he's going to want to stick it up my ass. 
[02:51:00]  Like, just that one step where it's probably going to be a problem, so they don't even  want to get started.  When you think about what Jimmy talks about, and then you wonder what the skeletons are  in his closet.  Yeah, what could there possibly be in there?  He's holding something back.  He's got to be holding something back.  It has to involve murdered children.  It's all I can imagine.  It's got to be kids, death, rape.  He's just going to have, like, another room that he's dug out in his basement or something  like that, but he's just got him down there bound and gagged and tries out his new bits 
[02:51:30]  on him.  What a little creep.  By the way, speaking of Bob Kelly, he gave us the famous cast.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  How's that going on the auction?  Yeah, on our O&A auction, it's up to $1,300.  Nice.  Broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Hold my hand, man.  Dane Cook obviously was there when that happened, filming the tourgasm thing.  I've never heard any horrific sound like that in my life.  That was just that pop.  And then when you see the video that goes with it, it's just, it's crazy. 
[02:52:00]  Bobby on the ground.  He had no business.  No business playing football.  None of us did, man.  Here's what was stupid.  You could.  I'm telling you, we were playing on uneven terrain in, like, a gravel pit.  You know, we were just like, oh, we'll throw a ball around, and then we got competitive.  It was not flat like a field.  It was really, like, hilly, and it was just, we were dumb.  We were dumb.  But Bobby tried to, you know, go up and do some kind of, like, Heisman fucking catch.  No, Bobby gets crazy when he plays sports. 
[02:52:30]  I remember one time I was playing against him, and he wasn't having a good day or something.  I had a couple of catches, and he just, he's hilarious.  He's just competitive.  So he got mad at me.  So I just see the look on his face that he wants to take me out on this play.  So he came at me, and somehow I was able to push him down to the ground, and he landed  on the ground.  He got, he was so mad that he grabbed two handfuls of grass, ripped him out of the ground,  and he got up, and he just threw him at me.  And they went about 90 miles an hour for two inches, and then they went,  I just remember this black kid who was on my team goes, yo, he bugged him. 
[02:53:00]  He had to go back to the huddle.  He was trying to hit you with, like, confetti.  Oh, yeah, he was unbelievable.  What is that going to do?  The rage.  Angry little guy.  He's the most competitive guy, I know.  And I admit, I'm pretty competitive, but we had a, when we used to have a game back in  93, I don't know if, Bill, you were part of this awful, horrible thing.  It was called Punch Each Other in the Asshole?  No, I would have remembered that. 
[02:53:30]  That's something you don't forget.  Okay, so we started this thing where we would just start randomly, if, you know, the other  one was walking in front of you up the stairs.  We would not just punch.  We would uppercut and try to hit taint, try to hit anything we could.  Full tilt boogie, punch in the asshole.  And it became like Bobby and I being so competitive about it that we actually had to sit down,  I'll never forget, sit down and have a very serious conversation about it, where it involved  us looking at each other going, we've got to stop punching each other in the ass. 
[02:54:00]  This is really, like, can we just, can we call it even, are we, you know, we have to  stop doing this.  And we couldn't.  I mean, for the longest time, we just still had to, like, and we wanted to make each other,  like, shit our pants.  It was like a full, like, a real, like, the hardest hit you could imagine.  I want to know how that starts.  One of you had to come up with it.  You didn't both come up with the idea at the same exact time.  Who punched whose ass?  And it's pretty brave for the person.  I was going to say, it's pretty brave for the person to introduce that to other guys.  Hey, guys, I've got a great new idea for us to pass the time. 
[02:54:30]  I would think to do the classic leg sweep.  If someone was in front of me, I would never think.  We used to do blindside tackle.  You know, one guy would, like, you know, be on all fours behind someone and then you  knock him over the guy.  Oh, yeah.  The bottom of the shoe kick when you're behind somebody and they're walking.  They step and you kick the bottom of their shoe and they do, like, a Nazi goose step with  one foot.  It goes flying.  Or the flat tire where you just step on the back of their shoe and take off their Achilles  tenders.  Just look at the cross check into the locker.  Yeah, that's always a good one.  You could be looking down for his notebook. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  Those unforgiving metal lockers.  I like the coin slap.  Anytime somebody's counting their change, you're like, what do you think I can?  And you just get it underneath.  It's just like this rainbow of currency.  You had your guys doing a lot of activities on tour there.  I saw the scooter race.  You would have slept all day.  I mean, that was the thing that was like, these guys hated me because I'm going, every  day we're going to get up, you know, just for the sake of filming during the day, you  know, because we'd sleep until, you know, you know, the crash.  They had some mean things to say about you, though, there, Dane, that you were working 
[02:55:30]  hard in between shows, horseback riding.  What else did you guys do?  Oh, we trashed Bob for that shit.  I was like, I opened for Charlie Murphy, but no point.  Oh, that's what it was, right?  Did he make me do activities?  My day was mine.  He didn't call me up.  Yo, we're playing checkers this morning.  Get your ass down here, bitch.  It looks like it's going to be a great video when it finally comes out.  I was watching the video portion of your package, Jesus, the Dane Cook CD, DVD thing on the  way to L.A. with the shorties and the preview for Torgasm. 
[02:56:00]  It looks like it's going to be a good thing when it finally comes out.  Everyone's been saying that, saying that you've got a clip of Bobby laying on the ground.  It's something about Bobby with his knee.  Yeah, just screaming and stuff.  Yeah, we have that on.  We filmed that.  The scooter race, though.  I saw, who took a dive on that?  Was that you?  That was me, man.  Yeah, that was really nasty.  That was day one.  And we had these little electronic scooters, and it was just, you know, it's going to be  great.  We're going to be racing again, me and Bobby.  Yeah.  And Bobby, very competitive again. 
[02:56:30]  Sticks his fucking foot right back into my tire.  He says he didn't do it on purpose, but if you look, you kind of see him kind of look  back, and I think he aimed it so he could jam my tire, and I, of course, went  over and cracked.  It's electric scooters, and Bobby's acting like it's the road warrior.  Bobby, he's a winner.  He will figure out how to come out on top.  Yeah.  He hates to lose.  Yeah.  Go for him.  Very competitive.  Yeah, we did activities.  That's on that clip on Kimmel.  That's right.  I saw it on Kimmel.  Yeah.  Is that where that was at?  Yeah, just face first. 
[02:57:00]  Dude, it's the asphalt.  And, Dink, you were in Rolling Stone recently.  The CDs, like, selling like crazy.  What is it up to now?  Because we've all been paying attention, going, holy shit.  The first week, it was, like, what, close to a quarter million copies?  Sold or something like that?  Yeah, I was trying to think.  It's...  I like the...  Yeah, we want gold.  We want gold.  I like the I don't know when they know the exact number.  Barry Katz knows exactly how many units.  Of course he does.  He knows exactly.  But the CD...  Gold, really?  The CD's gotten gold.  Yeah, we want gold.  You can't really call it a CD because you have the DVD in there and all sorts of stuff. 
[02:57:30]  Yep, yeah.  What is it?  Wait, is that half a million?  It's gold or a million?  With a double album, we've shipped almost 500,000.  So once you hit 250, that's gold on a double.  And then platinum is probably a few weeks away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  I know, man.  I sold three of my CDs off my website.  I bought them.  And I bought two of them.  I'm pretty proud of them.  You want them back?  It's just amazing because people aren't...  People are just not...  I've been autographing to you.  People are just not buying CDs, obviously, like they used to. 
[02:58:00]  So a comedy CD to sell that much, that's just phenomenal.  Yeah, somehow the CD, I've noticed, like I said, in the last few months, all of a sudden  you go to a college and it's like you're holding up like a fucking 8-track.  Oh, you were saying that the other day?  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  It's just, oh, now they all want like a DVD because they can get the shit for free somehow,  you know?  Yeah, somehow.  Just ask Steve.  He knows.  Let's say hi there.  Burn anything for us.  Yeah.  Mike on Long Island.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, boys, how you doing?  All right.  What's up?  Good.  Dan, I was at a show last night. 
[02:58:30]  Wonderful job.  Thank you, dude.  How do you feel when people applaud for bits you're about to do?  Oh, yeah.  All you said was, oh, I went to a party and the place blew up.  Right, right.  I mean, you know what?  It's flattering, of course, when people kind of hear their, you know, you feel a little  like Bon Jovi.  It's like, you guys know bad medicine?  And everybody just starts.  But, you know, that's why, dude, I like to kind of, I always try to improvise with stuff  and really not really know exactly where I'm going with it because at least that makes 
[02:59:00]  it interesting.  If you've heard the bit before, there's something in there you're like, oh, I never heard that  part.  Or it takes on kind of a new energy with every crowd.  But it's cool, man.  It's definitely, I did that one bit last night where I threw the mic out and they finished  the, I did the setup and then they finished the punch.  And that was, I've never really done anything like that.  Wow.  That was kind of wild.  Yeah.  We've talked to Brian Regan about that.  He goes, it's frustrating when people are yelling out the punchline of jokes, saying,  cup of dirt, do cup of dirt. 
[02:59:30]  And Brian's like, well, that's the punchline.  All right, I'll do it.  Big yellow one's the sun.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it's weird.  I mean, even like, I know, you know, I was reading all those things with Chappelle before  he went into hiding where it was like people were just coming and just, I'm Rick James,  bitch.  And it's like.  Yeah, that must have just been all over the place.  It's a blessing and a curse because you dream as a comic of doing something that people  actually give a shit about quoting at all.  And so you want that your whole career.  And then when they do it, you realize, oh man, it's, it's sometimes it can throw off the 
[03:00:00]  flow of the show.  But at this point, I'm digging it.  Well, you gotta be.  And it's great to be huge and on top like that.  Are you thinking about something like burnout or, you know, overexposure, shit like that,  where you go, uh-oh, you know, what do you do about that?  I'm just, at this point, it's, I mean, really, things are just starting to roll.  So I'm certainly not.  Yeah, I'm just, you know, whatever, I gotta take it right to the end.  He's going into movies next.  Is that it?  Do some flicks.  Yeah.  Any offers.  He'll be the next. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He'll be the next guy that just leaves his comedy behind and.  Never leave comedy behind, man.  And does the movie thing.  No, I definitely am going to start doing some more, more flicks.  But, you know, comedy is.  How many lame offers have you had for, like, sitcoms and movies that are just like, stop  it?  I, I, here's the worst pitch I ever had.  A guy brought me in a few years ago, and he goes, um, we're really excited.  We want to, who wants you to do this show?  I'll never forget.  Look at it.  I wanted to fucking kill you, man.  I got Barry next to me.  Can we get Barry on the air?  Barry, we love when you come on the air with us. 
[03:01:00]  Come on.  This is going to be the best pitch you've ever heard, man.  Everyone imitates Barry, and when we do it, no one understands who we're imitating.  But we have him in studio today, so.  You have to see him, he's the only guy I know who wipes his teeth while he's talking.  Listen, so the guy brings us in, and he goes, here's the show.  And this was the actual pitch.  He goes, okay, you're a teacher.  You're like a substitute teacher.  And so far, I'm like, okay, that hasn't been done, you know, a million times.  But yeah, and he's like, and the kids love you, but here's the deal.  You're magic. 
[03:01:30]  What?  And I'm like, okay, I do magic?  He's, no, no, no.  You're magical.  You're Mr. Wiz.  That was the name of the show.  You're Mr. Wiz.  And he had me driving, like, a rainbow VW Bug, and I do my spells on the kids, and I  mean, it was just, I sit there and hear this.  You're like, have you seen my stand-up, first of all?  Am I doing anything like what you're talking about?  Mr. Wiz.  I'm Mr. Wiz.  Every week.  I think I was on notice for a month after that.  Well, you should have been.  That's why Barry set up the man. 
[03:02:00]  That is horrible.  And what year was this about?  Buddy, you're going to be a big star.  Like, 98 or 90.  I don't know.  It was bad.  You know it just would have been bad effects.  Like, bad cheap sitcom special effects for your magic.  Yeah, where you stay still.  Yeah.  And then they put the other person who's supposed to appear around you, but you kind of see  that you're...  But you've moved a little bit in between.  Some awful time slot.  You're on right after Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.  That's your lead-in. 
[03:02:30]  You've made two of yourselves, and you have to talk to each other, and there's got to be  a wall line between the two of you where they superimpose you.  There's always a talking animal.  I got, like, a llama.  He's got those real creepy mannequin eyes.  Wow, that is a bad pitch.  I've heard them all.  You've got to think people are joking at first when you sit there, and they come up with these  pitches, and you're like, all right, this is a joke.  They're doing some kind of a punk show or something.  I actually, I had some guy pitch something to me a few months ago, again, with these guys, 
[03:03:00]  and I thought they were fucking with me.  I really, really thought.  Yeah, sometimes you get guys who pitch, and they have phenomenal ideas, and they've actually  written and produced, and the million-dollar things have gone on, but they are so nervous  when they pitch that they look like they're having a seizure when they're pitching.  That was the one you're talking about.  Yeah, the guy was sweating, and he's just rambling on and on.  There's no rhyme or reason.  But that was a real idea?  It was a real idea, but the guy literally had to carry him out of there. 
[03:03:30]  I was on notice again.  Yeah, I'm sure.  All right, you're hanging, right, Dane?  Yeah.  We're going to take a break.  What are we promoting today, Barry?  Because Dane's not going to do it.  Retaliation, baby.  Retaliation.  It's out there, and it's selling like crazy.  And you can come by the show.  We might release a few tickets that people don't show up for for guest lists and things  like that, like if your people don't show up.  No, I'm going.  We're all going tonight.  I'm serious.  We're all going to go see Dane. 
[03:04:00]  It's going to be a kick-ass show tonight, definitely, without a doubt.  All right, more with Dane Cook.  Also on the way, we've got Martha Stewart and P. Diddy rapping together.  Oh, this is...  We've got to do this while you guys are in studio today.  He diddy.  You know, I keep saying, wow, that guy's got no street cred, but he lost it so long ago.  Now, though, when he's rapping and teaching Martha Stewart how to rap.  Hip words and...  He's got his own line of craftsman tools that he just released.  Yo, let me tell you about my wrench. 
[03:04:30]  The Snoop with the golfing and the...  The Snoop is the worst.  Let me tell you it locks on to the nut.  It's wonderful.  Rap is where, like, heavy metal was in, like, 1990, when, like, Winger and all those groups  were coming.  It's over.  Yeah.  They used to be scary.  It was something that I was just like, everybody needs a sidekick.  Like, Snoop was so scary until he's like, let's go golfing-eye-a-fizzle.  It's like, golfing-lee-eye-a-coker.  If you could find a better de-zizzle, buy it. 
[03:05:00]  Why not?  Stop.  Oh, no, Snoop, stop.  What are you doing?  It's so not scary now.  You just...  Why not?  It's a little soft shoe there for us.  It just does...  It comes off so bad.  Lee-eye-a-coker.  Stop.  All right, more with Dane Cook.  As we go to break, I think we're going to play the Broke My Knee Man song.  Oh, I haven't heard this.  Yeah, the listeners really ran with this one, man.  They ran, man.  When you got us the audio of Bob Kelly breaking his knee, there were remixes.  Did you ever hear the Goodfellas? 
[03:05:30]  I thought was the good one.  I did hear that.  I did hear that, yeah.  Are you here?  Well, let's play it really fast.  It's only, like, 50 seconds.  Listen to this first.  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  You want, fucko?  You want something? 
[03:06:00]  What are you doing?  Oh, no.  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I swear to my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead.  Oh, my hand, man.  I've got to squeeze some.  Ah, fuck.  How good is that?  Oh, my God.  That's classic.  That came in from one of our listeners.  That's the best one.  We got...  Damn, is that the best? 
[03:06:30]  We had...  I can't even tell you how many came in, Dane.  Totally forgot about that one.  Oh, the Immigrant Song?  A couple dozen.  You want to play the Immigrant Song one?  Oh, please.  All right, listen to this.  I'll have to get these on, Dane.  Yeah, we'll give you a disco, all these.  Listen to this.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I broke it, dude.  I fell to crack. 
[03:07:00]  I broke my leg.  I broke it.  I broke it.  Aren't we great friends?  We're great friends.  I'm going to squeeze something that Bobby kept saying.  I've got to go hold my hand, man.  Oh, God.  And you've got the video that'll be part of the tourgasm video when it hits.  That'll be on there.  We're putting it together.  Do we have another one?  That alone is worth it.  You should throw some of these remixes on something.  I don't know what.  God damn.  They are heartless, the listeners. 
[03:07:30]  They don't care that he's injured.  They just see an opportunity for something funny.  Was the sheep one good?  I don't know.  This might...  Yeah, play that real fast.  It's only like 15 seconds.  Ah!  Oh, yeah.  Ah!  Ah, motherfucker.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  You mother...  Ah!  It's been backwards.  Ah!  Ah!  Fuck!  Steve, you've got to throw all these on a... 
[03:08:00]  Good God.  A CD for Dane.  I really have to injure Bobby again.  I think that was it.  We have so many.  I'm trying to remember some of the better ones.  Oh, God.  That Goodfellas one is so goddamn funny.  It fits perfectly.  It fits perfectly.  Best one ever.  I have to say, man.  The thing that, you know...  I've got to give Bobby props.  Anybody else would have left that tour that night.  And he got back on a non-stop moving bus.  And he's on there with his fucking wobbly leg.  And so he hung in there, man. 
[03:08:30]  That was great.  We'll play the Broke My Knee song going into break.  Maybe some more remixes.  But definitely more with Dane Cook in just a bit.  Down!  You're way down!  He's down!  Ow!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, dude!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[03:09:00]  Ow!  Ow!  What?  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, dude!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Water!  Water!  Water!  I'm gonna squeeze something!  Ow!  Ah!  On the sides!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I broke my knee, man!  Shit!  It bent fine to me!  Make your hyperextend!  Ah!  I broke my knee man 
[03:09:30]  Oh my god  I broke my fucking knee dude  I heard it break dude  I broke my knee man  I broke my knee man  I broke my knee man  I broke my knee dude  I broke my knee man  I broke my knee man  I broke my knee man  I broke my knee dude  I'm going to spray something.

[03:10:30]  Hold my hand, man.  I got a squeeze.  Dude, I don't move.  Hold my hand, man.  I got a squeeze.  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it.  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg, man.

[03:11:00]  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  man. I broke my knee, dude. I'm in so much pain, dude. I'm in so much pain. Like sand through 
[03:11:30]  the hourglass. So is the O&A virus. Let's say hi to Dragon Wagon. Yeah, guys, you totally.  What? What? You broke up. We can't hear you. You totally offended me today. We totally.  I was an over-the-road truck driver and this dude of these things that you all are talking  about is ridiculous. What are you talking about? The what thing, sir? Could you take  any histamine before you call next time? Clog-nosed idiot. You guys are disgusting. I mean, 
[03:12:00]  you know, I turned it on. I'm calling XM and complaining about this channel. Let's all  of this do it. Really? Yeah. What don't you like about the channel? Well, you guys are  hot. You wouldn't be Howard Stern. I mean, you know, it's indecent. It's immoral what you're  talking about. You know what you should do, sir? Right after you call XM, you should drink  a fifth of old granddad and then drunk drive into a schoolyard. No one cares about you 
[03:12:30]  or if you're offended. Block the channel, stupid. It's an XL channel. You can block it. That's  why XM has that. You need to F you. That's what you need to do, okay? I'm hanging up.  Good. Hang up. Cancel XM and drop dead. Also go that far. All right. Don't cancel XM. Go to  listen to XM Kids or something. Yeah, go. Yeah, exactly. Maybe that's the wrong thing to say  I've heard of Eric Logan. And this guy, now he's listening to himself. He'll be listening.  I'll go into Sirius Radio. Good. Go to Sirius Radio. There's a fucking dog for the thing. 
[03:13:00]  They stink. You're going to have to drive a truck to have Sirius. Throw it in the back  of the truck, you fucking hick. Die. Why don't you fucking blow your nose before you call  a national radio show, you crank-doing jerk-off? Now he's listening to himself. Of course he  is. He'll be listening. Of course he will. He'll be listening. He'll call tomorrow. And 
[03:13:30]  he doesn't even have the balls to say, fuck you. We're uncensored, pal. You could say,  fuck you. I don't believe in that. You don't believe in that? You're a liar and you're a  failure. Well, I'm not a failure. Yes, you are. I'm an over-the-road truck driver. Why don't  you have your fucking sinuses fixed? I'm an over-the-road truck driver. Yeah, all truck drivers  are over-the-road, stupid. They don't go through lawns and pools. You redundant shithead.  You are a good buddy. Are we going to do what they say can't be done? I didn't hear you, 
[03:14:00]  sir. I'm doing drugs and surviving an incest experience.  Break-up, break-up for the Dragon Wagon. Is that his name, Dragon Wagon?  Dragon Wagon, you got your ears off.  We'll bring it back no matter what it takes. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. You sounded like you  had more brains on the radio. We've got it long. And it's short time to get there. Hold 
[03:14:30]  on, sir. Wait, sir. Is your name really, dude, is your name really Dragon Wagon? You're a grown  man with a name that rhymes. Hey, slow down with the weird grown-up names. Yeah, that's  a childhood name. At least it doesn't rhyme. It's not Mopey Opie. It's Mopey Opie. Slim  Jim. And whatever the fuck rhymes with Anthony. I can't think of anything. Shmanthony. Oh, 
[03:15:00]  well. If you don't understand, I'm out of here busting my ass for you people to be doing  your dumb radio. What are you? How are you busting your ass for us, stupid? You're busting  your ass to put food on your fat wife's table. We have nothing to do with it. No. You're  the type that voted for George Bush, aren't you? You're the type that voted for George Bush.  No, sir. I don't vote. I talk a lot of shit and then I sit home on election day. That's  the beauty of me. But you're the reason the fuel prices are so hot in this country driving  I'm the reason you motherfucker. You drive a truck. I have a Saturn. I cruise prostitutes 
[03:15:30]  in Manhattan. Your food has to get there. You have fucking 80 gallons of fuel in your  vehicle. I go a month on a gallon of gas. 43rd Street to 15th Street. Circle for four  hours. Back home. Opie and Anthony. The virus is spreading. All right. Very, very busy day 
[03:16:00]  on the Opie and Anthony program today. Bill Burr in studio. Definitely want to remind people  Bill's half hour comedy special on HBO is tonight at midnight. Make sure you check out  Bill Burr. It's tomorrow night at midnight too. Well, I got the on demand, so I'll be watching  it Sunday morning when I wake up. In your slippers. And of course, Dane Cook playing Madison Square  Garden tonight. It's a nice little room. Not bad. Jesus Christ. Playing the garden. Where 
[03:16:30]  is that? It's no Carnegie Hall, but it's... No one's got to ask that. I'm playing the  chuckle hut. Where is that? I'm playing the garden. Is that the... What garden? The fucking  garden. That's fantastic. I think last time, who said it, it's great to not have the words  ha-ha in the phone number? Yeah. Oh, that's good. And of course, the CD slash DVD is called  Retaliation. Dane Cook selling, like, hotcakes. Yes. Were hotcakes ever really selling? Was there  like a time in history when hotcakes were just... It must have been. Just for that saying to be 
[03:17:00]  there, there must have been one time where we're like, we're fresh out again. Jesus. They just sold.  Comedy clubs really do have some of the worst fucking names. I worked to play side splitters.  Side splitters. Why don't you just call it knee slappers? Gay club that I had to play years ago.  Remember Fiddlesticks? Yeah. Fiddlesticks. Fiddlesticks. Then I'll be at Gaffaws. We had to take a break  just to take leaks and stuff, but the stuff that was happening during the break was really  entertaining as well. Dane met the lead singer of Missing Persons. Bill was talking about Scary 
[03:17:30]  Spice. Oh, opening up for Wynonna Judd. Just talking about Wynonna Judd. Outside at a racetrack  at like 12 noon. 12 noon at a racetrack. The cars or a horse? What was it? A horse.  A horse track? A horse track. And I'm standing up there just bombing. You can't shit on the  crowd because it's her audience and you don't want to, you need the gig at that point.  Yeah. Yep. And I'm standing there. There's people kind of filing in and there's this lesbian  biker looking chick. My whole set, she's just standing there chanting, Wynonna! Wynonna! 
[03:18:00]  Oh God. And you just want to be, you fucking whore. You just want to go off on her and you  can't. You got to be actually cordial. Yeah. Do that. Like a game show host. How do you  not, first of all, have a nervous breakdown before you go out on stage? And how do you  even step out onto that stage? That's where you comics, I don't even know how. People  ask me, they go, why don't you try stand-up? Are you insane? To have to do something like  that where you know the gig is a fucking, it's noon at a horse racetrack to a crowd that 
[03:18:30]  wants to see Wynonna Judd and you actually make your legs work and walk out onto a stage.  How do you do it? I literally learned how to bomb gracefully on that gig. I'll never  forget it. I was sitting there, I was just eating my balls, just feeling like an asshole  and somewhere in the middle of it, I swear to God, I just started imagining Patrice O'Neill,  Keith Robinson and Jim Norton sitting in the back watching me, laughing at me and I somehow  started laughing at myself. How fucking ridiculous. I mean, I was in the middle of my set at one 
[03:19:00]  point, out of nowhere, they all just go, ah, screamed and I'm like, you know, I thought  my fly was down. I turned around, way in the background was a carnival and some guy  was on that ride where you get shot into the fucking air and I guess that went up and over  me from behind. I just started doing this self-deprecating how pathetic my career was  and I was able to handle that lady in a roundabout way, called her a lesbian, which of course the  whole country audience loved. I said something about her haircut, how short it was and people 
[03:19:30]  knew what I was alluding to. You know, country people, fuck the queers. I got them on my  side. But no, it was just, it was brutal. I just, I have no clue how you do that. That's  what I do now. Anytime a horrible, I just picture up, Dane, I'll picture somebody I know just  laughing. Yeah, that's a good one. Because that's how you got through like the beginning  ones. Like as you're going up at the fucking Bell Rican 99 and the game's on, it's like  you, I've been watching him bombing and it's like you want to laugh but it's like you know 
[03:20:00]  you're going up there too. It's like you've got an ass kicking cum and stuff. You're almost  jealous like fuck. These guys love when he's getting it over with. He's halfway through  it. These guys love when they're on bomb. That's the one thing I learned, you know, hanging  out with a lot of comedians. You guys love when someone's eating. Yeah, it's almost  absolutely. It's like sport to you guys. Oh yeah. It's fair game with each other. It's  almost like, you know, the way black guys can call each other the N word and like it's  cool. Like comics can be like, dude, you stink, you bombed and it's like, yeah, it was good, 
[03:20:30]  huh? But anybody else says it. Do you know, do you know like the worst heckle like you've  ever gotten? Do you, do you keep that on tap? Like the worst thing that anybody's ever  yelled? Oh yeah. The most bizarre one I ever got? I was at Dangerfield's third show on  a Saturday night. There's like fucking 30 people there. That place is the worst.  Unbelievable. So there's these three angry white dudes in the back and you just can feel  the rage. Ghosts are walking out during your set. It looks like a funeral home, man.  I know. It's like you just feel the rage in these guys and I hear them talking and I know 
[03:21:00]  they're fucking talking about me and I'm like, dude, don't go there. Don't talk to them.  I just, after a while, I just couldn't. I finally just said, you guys, what's your problem,  man? You just, you just, you just talking, you know, what's, what's going on? And this  dude, this most bizarre heckle ever, he goes, anything red and on stage is a  faggot. And it was just, it was so fucking bizarre. I didn't even have a comeback to  it, but it was like brilliant. And I was sitting there going like, and he was so angry the 
[03:21:30]  way he said it. I knew if I just said one thing back to him, I had a fist in my face.  Yeah. So I somehow had to just go back into my act. So, so I got a computer recently and  just completely blew it off.  I had a guy at Dublin's one night, he was sitting in the front row and he was really,  really despondent and he's drunk and he's talking to himself and he turned his chair  away from the stage, but he's right up front. So he's facing the crowd. He's like doing little  monologues to himself and trying to like, like the shows on him. And I, same thing. I'm like, 
[03:22:00]  dude, what's your problem? What's your problem? Three or four times. And he keeps like shrugging  me off. And I finally go, I go, I go, I really, man, what is your problem? And he stands up  and he, the whole place goes quiet because he's holding a bottle in his hand. I think  somebody thought he was going to throw it. And he goes, I've got seven problems and you're  five of them. Wow. That's really fucking genius. Did he name them? Did he name the five?  No, he never even got into it. I think we did actually get to a little, I think I, no, 
[03:22:30]  we, we had a little fight up front. Why are those people there? Like, I don't get  why they're even there. I've been to comedy clubs and I've seen comics that just have  sucked and you sit and wait for the next guy. It's that why, why do people feel compelled?  You fucking suck. You're an asshole. I'll tell you what are the best. Like you go up in front  of an all black crowd. It's like what I quickly learned is they're going to have fun with you  or without you. So you make them laugh. It's the way you bomb from a black crowd. It's 
[03:23:00]  like the joke bombs. There's nothing. And then everybody laughs that it got nothing.  I remember one time I'm just mixed nuts in LA, just eating my balls and it's all black  crowd. So I do some joke, but I put up with that nothing. And then I see this big black  lady in the background goes, and then they all just fucking laughing. And once again,  I don't address it. I go into my neck. Oh, just dry mouth. And it's even worse when  making that. Oh yeah. Sound on the mic. Yeah. And he forgot to bring water up. It's just, 
[03:23:30]  oh, it's the, it's the worst. I just remember gigs where nothing was happening. I could just  hear that fucking Patrice laugh from the back of the room where it'd be like that same kind  of, cause he has that kind of, yeah. Patrice can actually make you bomb. I've had crowds liking  me. He didn't like the joke and he's so fucking loud and intimidating. He would get a crowd to  turn on you. Oh, what's that shit? Yo, Bill's up there. He's talking about this motherfucker 
[03:24:00]  Jitson. And the whole crowd is turning around and no one's going to tell him to shut up.  And then you start yelling at him. And then all of a sudden, the white guy's yelling at  the big black guy. This is racism. And then you lose all the white people in the crowd.  And he can literally turn around a good set. That is true. Let's go to the phones here.  Andy has a question. Andy, what's up? Andy. Hey. No, nothing. You? His name's not Andy.  It's probably like somebody else. Andrew. Andrew. And he thinks it's, or Anthony, or. 
[03:24:30]  The guy that has a question for Dane Cook about a corporate gig. No? No, nothing. All right.  He wanted to ask you if you were fired from a corporate gig. Like there might be a story there.  Is there urban legend out there about that? No, you know what? No, I'll tell you what it  is because I was hired to do these two corporate gigs. And I just did the first one out now.  And I never, I never, I never do them. You know what I mean? All two corporate gigs?  No, because it's just like, you don't really enjoy it. You feel rented. You feel like a part  of the, you know. You really do. It's just, so I agreed to do it because they were really 
[03:25:00]  enthusiastic. It came with the tent. Oh, yes. One of those floppy arm dolls that's behind you  on stage. Like, you know, come buy a car. And so, I agreed to do it.  Oh, hold on, hold on. Go ahead, Barry.  What happens to these corporate gigs? They, like, they always overpay. They completely  overpay. They'll send private jets. They'll do whatever. It's like, whatever it takes.  And so, it's always hard to turn down, yeah, to walk away from those things. 
[03:25:30]  So, I'm like, you know what? I'll do it. I haven't done one in years. And that's two gigs  and the money's fucking great. So, I go down and the first thing I always say, the second  I walk into, you know, any gig, you know what I do on stage. You've got the material.  You've heard the CD. Oh, yeah, we all listen to it. That's what I'm going to do tonight.  They even have to sign a waiver to do it.  Yeah. So, I do the show. I do my show, you know, exactly the same way. And the crowd's  laughing. They're into it. Actually, you know, I didn't think it was going to, it wasn't 
[03:26:00]  so bad. They weren't, but of course, the president of the deal comes up.  But you got a full standing ovation at the end.  I know. I mean, the show was good for that environment. And then they came up and they're  like, we just want to talk to you about the content.  Oh, boy.  The president of the company was not too enthused. And then I'm like, okay. And he goes, if  we make you a list for the next show of things. And I was like, I'm not the guy for you.  Obviously, you should, you know, call somebody who can come in and do what you need. But it's  like, I gave you the shit. Watch the stuff. You know what I mean? And if I'm not going to 
[03:26:30]  Dustin Diamond is doing the gig.  I'm just kidding.  I wouldn't have doubted it, though.  So, no.  Did you get paid for the whole thing?  No. I got paid for the first show. I told him, see you later.  Keep the other half.  Good for you, man.  And it was a mutual walk away.  You know someone's head rolled for that, too. You know someone got the axe.  Who was the head of entertainment for that corporate gig? It was some Missy down in personnel.  And it can literally be just one little thing. And then they'll try not to pay you. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. All kinds of things can happen.  Let's say hi to Sarah.  Get the Bacon Brothers. They'll do it.  Remember when we saw the Bacon Brothers at one of those corporate gigs?  They're on morning TV yesterday promoting their singing thing.  Hey, Sarah, what's up?  Hey, guys. I was at the Dane Cook and Bob Kelly show last night.  Granted, it wasn't exactly Bob Kelly show.  But it was so funny.  My friend and I had such a great time.  I just wanted to tell them that you guys were awesome. 
[03:27:30]  And afterwards, well, we thought it was pretty hysterical.  These two Thatchicks come up to my friend Britt and I.  And they're like, we just flirted our way in and blah, blah, blah.  And I looked at them and I'm like, you look like you got in because you're one of Maury Povich's special children.  Not because you flirted your way.  They said they flirted their way in?  What, to the backstage or whatever?  Yeah, that's what they were telling us.  And it was pretty funny.  And also, Dane Cook signed my friend's boobs.  And Bob Kelly did, too. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, very nice.  Sounds like a great night for everybody.  Everyone had fun.  We had so much fun.  But we have to say, like, my friend and I, like, we felt kind of bad because, you know,  Dane Cook was, like, leaving in, like, a limo or a town car or whatever.  And Bob Kelly was getting in a minivan.  I love it.  I can't wait to get Bob on the phone.  But it's in the studio.  No, we're trying to get Bob on the phone.  But I don't know.  He's probably sleeping or whatever.  So he sprained his wrist closing that sliding door on the van. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, Bob's not here, Sarah.  Oh, okay.  Well, I've been an ONA fan since you guys were on WNEW.  My brother's got me hooked on you guys.  I'm a huge fan.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  And I'm not an ugly chick that's a huge fan.  All right.  We'll meet you soon.  Thank you, Sarah.  Thank you, Sarah.  Thanks for coming down to the show.  All right.  Thanks so much, guys.  All right.  Yeah, I mean, Dane's killing.  We're all going to tonight's show.  I can't wait.  Which one are you guys coming into?  The first or the second?  11 o'clock show, I'll be at.  Cool.  That's what I was told. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  He said it's even better.  Late show's always a little bit better.  You know what I mean?  Late shows can be touch and go, though, because you've got the audience, you know.  Yeah.  A little more boozed up.  A little boozed up.  You can handle that, though.  It's all part of the deal.  Some comedians can't handle that.  Nah.  Do we want to promote any of these other shows?  Loyola College tomorrow night?  That's a private gig.  All right.  Yeah.  October, what do we got?  October 7th, Colorado Convention Center.  That's supposed to be.  That's a pretty big gig.  That's a pretty big venue.  Awesome.  And then ME is Maine, right? 
[03:29:30]  Colby College.  October 14th.  Yep.  In Waterville, Maine.  Yep.  And then the University of New Hampshire, October 15th.  Sure.  And the new city's called Retaliation.  UNH.  UNH, yeah.  UNH.  You guys want to listen to the Martha Stewart thing real fast?  Oh, here's Bobby.  Oh, Bobby's on.  All right.  Bob, what's up?  You tell that bitch it wasn't a minivan.  I got into one of those little bike cabs.  A bike cab.  I'm not even kidding you.  I had to take a fucking bike cab to the show last night. 
[03:30:00]  Are you kidding?  There was no cabs at 6 o'clock.  So I had to get this Polish dude on a bike.  To pedal you down there?  Yeah.  I would walk first.  I asked him how much it was.  He looked me up and down.  He said, 20.  That's usually, what, 10?  Probably around 5.  Fans saw him?  You saw Bob Kelly?  Yeah, I saw Bob Kelly getting pedaled by me on 42nd Street.  Is that Nathaniel?  Yeah.  I saw him on the side.  I was like, Nathaniel. 
[03:30:30]  He looked at me like, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, you called out to me.  You could have just pedaled by anonymously, but you thought it would be good to say hi.  Bob, you couldn't get on that big eight-person circular bicycle that rides through Times Square  that you want to fucking run over when I'm driving in the city?  No, there was nothing.  There was a brand new one, though.  It was brand new.  He said I was the first one ever on that bike.  Who cares?  You don't ever want to be seen in that thing.  Well, what was I going to do?  Walk?  Did you stop to listen to the guys play the Spackle Buckets, too? 
[03:31:00]  I'm sorry.  I didn't have a limo.  Pick me up at my five-star hotel.  You're not a fancy man.  Hey, Bob.  We learned a lot about you today, thanks to Dane Cook.  You used to have very long hair.  Oh, shit.  Looking like, what did you say, Crystal Gale?  Oh, yeah.  He's a great reference today.  Crystal Gale.  He had long, long, luxurious hair.  Remember that, Bob?  Did you call me fucking Crystal Gale?  I called you Crystal Gale, man.  And you used to play the Punch in the Asshole game?  Yeah, but that was...  Dane invented that. 
[03:31:30]  He came up to me one time and just punched me in the asshole.  I'm going to shit my pants.  And you ran with it.  And what did you do afterwards?  I made that up.  What did you say after that?  That's mine.  I trademarked it.  I sell it on my website.  You can buy a kit.  It's a home game.  Yeah, I used to have...  But, Dane, you had long hair, too, man.  Yeah, I had kind of the mullet thing going.  There's a picture of you on the internet, bro.  Me and you both at the same time had...  We looked like Charlie's Angels.  There was a...  There was a time when the mullet wasn't the mullet. 
[03:32:00]  No, it wasn't.  It was just the haircut.  It was a feather.  Dennis Miller had that haircut for a long time.  That's what it was.  And then it turned into this mullet,  where all of a sudden to have it was to be just some...  Backwards, cross-eyed hick at a car show or something.  I got to say, though, Dane's hair was beautiful in conditions.  Mine was nappy and curly.  I do say that Dane had better hair than me.  Dane, you remember that time we picked up those two chicks at the beach? 
[03:32:30]  Oh, my...  The witches?  Oh, my...  Me and Dane picked up two witches from Salem.  At the beach.  But Dane was always a conservative type of kid,  and I was always, like, the creepy...  I want to lick somebody's ass off.  Like, they had, like, knife scars on their face, Bobby's chicks, you know?  Yeah.  So we wind up going back,  but I'm the one always the aggressor with the chicks,  and Dane's kind of laid back, kind of always had a chick,  and I'm the one, you know, banging broads all the time  and talking about pussy,  and we get back to their apartment in Salem, 
[03:33:00]  and it's this...  Like, this house has been there since 1702,  and they're telling us...  They take us in the basement and tell us about the witches,  and I'm shitting my pants.  We go back upstairs, they both get naked,  start taking showers.  Yeah.  I'm frantic.  I'm frantic.  Dane has the guitar in his hand,  and they come out naked.  I'm like, dude, what the fuck are we going to do?  He goes, Bobby, get your fucking shit together.  And just starts playing a song on the guitar.  He knows how to work it. 
[03:33:30]  Get the guitar out, start playing a little.  But Bobby's like, they're doing spells in there, man.  They're putting spells on us or something, dude.  He was so concerned that they were trying to really put some kind of text.  How much cult had he done to paranoia himself up that much?  Yeah, when it comes time to gameplay,  Dane really is the quarterback.  Get your shit together, faggot.  How you girls doing?  Do you ever hear this song?  By Moody Blues?  Wishy Woman.  Moody Blues.  This is Vixen's Edge of a Broken Heart.  Did you tell them that you shit in a bucket? 
[03:34:00]  No.  Oh, now we're in the...  See, now we're in the...  Yeah, we're in the dirt.  We're in the good stuff now.  Who?  We're in the fucking tour...  You can't shit on the tour bus.  Yeah, you're not allowed to take craps on the tour bus.  You're not allowed to shit on the tour bus whatsoever.  That's good.  We understand that, right?  And so I'm sitting there.  I'm on my computer.  Dane goes in the bathroom.  He comes out.  He goes, hey, dude, check this out.  He has a brand new sterling silver toilet bowl.  And it was so perfect, the shit, that I thought it was fake. 
[03:34:30]  You had a wastebasket.  He showed you the wastebasket.  Yeah, I had the wastebasket, probably.  It was a wastebasket.  Whatever.  Barry, shut your face.  You're not my manager, all right?  Shut your mouth.  Well, you did say that.  If you let him on the microphone again, I'll come down there right now and punch him right  in one tooth.  Hey, it was a wastebasket, buddy.  Listen, people are listening.  I could do something for you.  You're going to be a big star.  You're going to be a big star.  You broke your knee.  This is going to put you on the map, buddy. 
[03:35:00]  I'm thinking if we could dislocate your shoulder on 4,000, too, I could get you on Carson Daly.  God, that's how it works, though.  All right, so the shit in the wastebasket.  It was perfect.  You know, my weak stomach.  Yeah.  I didn't think it was real.  Oh, no.  But then I look in again, and I just saw a shit drip.  And then his face.  Bobby gets that face when he's like, he wants to puke, but he starts getting that, like, 
[03:35:30]  body in a river for three days look.  You know, it's just like.  Floated.  His eyes look like a shark.  They just, like, turn black and glazy.  Who shits in a bucket?  Well, you got it.  Not on the bus.  What a great rule that is, though.  Because once someone shits on that bus, it's over.  Well, these guys.  Anthony, I agree with that.  When you're doing 85 down some highway, but when you're parked next to the college and  there's 98 toilets five feet away from you, there's no need to shit in the bus. 
[03:36:00]  These guys locked me in my.  I know you guys locked me in the back room one night.  I had the back, you know, back room.  It was like a little sliding door.  And the bus was so dry that I bought one of those humidifiers.  And so I have to take a piss at, like, five in the morning.  We're moving.  I get up, and that door is jammed.  And I know these guys have, like, pinned it or done something.  So I'll lay down for, like, another hour, but now I've really got to go.  And I'm like, I'm back.  I'm like, come on, guys.  But the engine is, I think three hours later, I finally had to piss in my humidifier. 
[03:36:30]  That's how bad it was.  I had to piss in my humidifier.  And it's all on film.  I hope you throw it away after that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The bus driver.  What was his name again, Dan?  Brian.  Oh, this guy.  I love this.  This guy was the biggest creep.  I would wake up in the middle of the night and just go sit with him.  Like, two weeks into the tour, he starts yelling at me.  He goes, what the fuck kind of tour is this?  What the fuck?  There's no alcohol. 
[03:37:00]  There's no fucking drugs.  You guys are fucking whores.  What the fuck is it?  You're playing Xbox, you fucking bunch of faggots.  What was wrong with that guy?  I don't know, dude.  He had driven, like, you know, everybody.  Like, Usher and, like, all these, you know, huge...  Which means he gets the pussy that they don't want to fuck.  Right.  By the way, if Jimmy was here, he would have called out that Bob's story had no ending.  Had no nothing.  Well, apparently you just did.  Thanks, dude.  No, I was just saying, if Jimmy was here, he would have done it.  Well, we're all looking around the studio, uh, uncomfortably. 
[03:37:30]  I didn't point it out.  I pointed out that Jimmy would have pointed it out.  But you, by doing that, you pointed it out.  Not, not at all.  You need, like, a little sound bite of Jimmy just being like, nothing.  Shut up.  You got nothing.  Let it sit.  Good story, fat girl.  All right, Bob.  I guess we're going to let you go.  They're telling us, uh, you got to go.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You guys going tonight, right?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Well, you know, the show's going to be great tonight.  It's probably just going to be just as good as next week at Stress Factory in New Jersey,  where I'm headlining the 22nd. 
[03:38:00]  Ah!  Nice slipping.  I'll see you guys later.  Take care.  We'll see you tonight at the 11 o'clock show.  Take care.  Don't dislocate a toe at this show.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Do we have time to try this Martha Stewart thing?  Yeah, a little bit.  Why don't we try it?  What is she doing?  She's rapping with P. Diddy.  Yeah.  She's got some show that's like The Apprentice, only she's hosting it.  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  Yes, Than?  Yes, Than?  Than knows.  I think she also has just sort of a talk craft show.  Oh, is that it?  Is that what it is? 
[03:38:30]  It's four?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You're right.  No.  She was wearing an M. Diddy belt buckle while this was going on.  Oh, my God.  M. Diddy diamond belt buckle.  She's M. Diddy.  And P. Diddy was there to help her out with some slang and language.  It's Miss Martha from Jersey City.  I'll bake you a cake and make your crib look pretty.  Mm-hmm.  I get snad respect like my man Big Diddy.  I can't look at anybody.  I got the heaters running out of breath like when he ran the city. 
[03:39:00]  Keep going.  They thought they could stop me, but they must be silly.  Silly.  I got my ankle bracelet off.  Now I'm free like Willie.  Yeah.  It's the Kmart Queen, so I know you feel me.  They gave me love on the inside.  That's why they call me M. Diddy.  M. Diddy, baby.  Oh, no.  Don't clap.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I can't look at anybody.  I can't look at any of you.  Oh, no.  I told you.  They're in the winger era. 
[03:39:30]  Have you ever been so embarrassed for somebody that you don't want to make eye contact with  anybody lest they share that embarrassment and you have to acknowledge it?  What was worse, her rapping or his, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.  That's going to get him the cred he needs.  Bad boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah-ha.  The M. Diddy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  That hurt.  I don't like when things like that hurt.  Well, then Diddy Peaches starts teaching Martha Stewart some raps. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, Rochester.  I'm here with my bro, Diddy, and I'm so excited because he's going to teach me how to rap.  Now, I just want you to notice, Wes, what are the security guards doing?  BB and J's.  Oh, they're eating.  See, they took me out.  That is so great.  Well, first of all, what I really want to know is what are the meanings of, like, these  few words, okay?  Little 101.  Is cheddar cheese? 
[03:40:30]  No.  Oh, my God.  I don't get the slang.  Cheddar's money.  The cheese.  Oh.  Cheddar.  Okay.  Cheddar's money.  Okay, shorty.  Okay.  I have no idea.  I mean, you're, you're.  I'm Tolly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're Tolly.  Your daughter.  I've seen your daughter.  Yeah.  You know, I will call her a shorty.  Because she's, like, six feet tall?  No, no, no.  She's, um, young, pretty thing.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, she's a shorty.  What about nigga?  Yeah.  What does that mean?  She's going to get booked on, uh, P. Diddy's Bad Boys at Comedy. 
[03:41:00]  She'll be the next person to eat their balls on that show.  Tolly, see?  Yeah.  Flawson.  Which is?  What you're doing right now with that $8 million piece of ice around your neck.  That's Flawson.  Benjamin's, um, which you make a lot of.  That's $100 bill.  That's money.  Oh, Benjamin Franklin.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, oh, my God.  Hey.  What does that have to do with not flossing your teeth?  No, it's, it's, Flossin, Flossin is just over the top.  So it's just. 
[03:41:30]  This needs white guy voice.  And then ballin'.  Wow.  Ballin'.  I mean, I know what ballin' is.  And you know she's pretending to be that stupid.  What is it to rap?  Oh, okay.  Ballin' to rap is livin' life to the fullest.  It's just, you know, um.  Oh, okay.  You work hard.  Having a ball.  There you go.  Work hard.  You play hard.  Ooh.  Wow.  That is harsh.  What is he doing?  Diddy and, uh, Gladback. 
[03:42:00]  Just a line.  He's got his own, uh, Ziploc line coming out.  The Diddy.  Diddy zip.  Keeps all your food chill.  With a fragrance.  Keeps it fresh, yo.  Keeps it all fresh.  Yo, fresh.  Wow.  That is horrible.  Biggie should come back from the dead and shoot him.  He's gonna be trying.  Yeah.  He's trying.  They should come back from the dead and sit on him.  Just kill it.  There is no reason that he should be hanging out with Martha.  Wow.  How bad.  What happened? 
[03:42:30]  What happened to the rap world?  Thank God there's so few guys out there killing each other to keep the whole thing real.  Because the pioneers, the guys that were in there pretty early,  they've just all turned into nothing.  Yeah, I a kizzle.  I'll tee you off.  I'll golf with you.  Make sure you buy a Dodge.  Oh, all those guys.  It's so weird.  It's so embarrassing.  See what they were doing a while back.  Oh, we're in the countdown.  We're done with the show today. 
[03:43:00]  Brian in Dallas, real fast.  Yeah, hey, I was just wondering when Dane's gonna come down here to the improv  and when the Torgasm DVD comes out.  Dallas?  Yeah.  Around Dallas?  All right, man.  We're putting a big retaliation tour together.  Hopefully it'll start sometime into the fall.  And as far as Torgasm, we're editing it together.  And we'll just see.  It'll be done when it's done.  It's gonna take a little while.  I don't think he's gonna be playing the improv anytime soon.  You know where the Cowboys play football?  You might want to look for him there. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, they just added three shows.  Yeah, two shows.  All right, Brian.  Thanks, guys.  Well, we're running out of show here.  Dane, this was a pleasure, man.  Thank you so much for coming by.  Finally.  We've had you on the phone a few times, but in studio, it's great.  Much gooder.  We'll be at the show tonight, and of course, everyone should look for a retaliation in their  their old record stores.  CD and DVD.  Right?  Yes.  Anything else we want to promote there, Barry? 
[03:44:00]  No.  We did good for you, right, Barry?  Thank you so much.  I love you guys.  Good.  It's been a long time.  We haven't seen Barry in a few years.  You guys are going to be big stars.  Yeah.  We'll do some things with Barry in the coming months.  You never know.  And of course, Bill Burr sitting in for Jim Norton.  Bravo, Bill.  Good job.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun with Bill the last couple of days.  You're going to do the whole week next week?  Yeah.  We got Bill over the next week as well.  Yeah.  The novelty wears off already, and he's just like, hot.  And I already did this morning.  I was like, they do this every fucking day.  Oh, we're done. 
[03:44:30]  HBO tonight.  Bill Burr.  Program complete. </pre>
