<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a discussion of the successful Patrice O'Neal benefit show, highlighting performances by Bill Burr, Bobby Kelly, Keith Robinson, Marina Franklin, Ian Edwards, and Colin Quinn.  Will Sylvian’s involvement in producing commemorative t-shirts was mentioned, along with an anecdote about his iPhone malfunction during a poem reading.  A sleeping audience member was also noted.  The conversation then shifted to Anthony Cumia's recent CNN appearance concerning his drone usage, focusing on his repeated use of "in my case, it's photography" to deflect questions.  They revisited a past interview where they intentionally gave misleading answers, resulting in a strained interviewer relationship.  The hosts also analyzed their own past, provocative responses to a news story about a woman who died participating in a radio contest involving excessive water consumption.  Other news items covered included an alleged assault by a CBS news anchor and Alec Baldwin's confrontation with paparazzi. The segment concluded with their recurring "divas" bit, cataloging complaints about studio issues.

The show then tackled former Senator Scott Brown's "pocket tweeting" explanation for his late-night tweets, mocking the technological impossibility of his claim, with Jim Norton expressing significant disbelief.  Audio clips of Brown's interview were played.  The second major topic was a video of a TSA agent interacting with a young girl in a wheelchair, prompting a discussion about the mother’s reaction and whether it was an overreaction or a calculated attempt to gain media attention.  The hosts and guest, Travis, debated the justification of the TSA's actions.

Throughout the show, there were several recurring bits: a running gag about a lack of tissues, invented Black History Month contributions, a comedic skit featuring "BoboCop," a discussion of Clive Davis coming out as bisexual, a discussion of a leaked Justin Bieber phone call detailing a castration plot, and jokes about Kim Kardashian's buttocks. Studio guests included Bob Kelly and David Tell.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of signed artwork and a mishap involving comedian Rich Voss. This transitioned into a highly graphic description of Jonathan’s penis, followed by a detailed account of a listener contest, a “gay-off,” involving explicit sexual acts performed by straight men for a $1500 prize, with their wives watching.  Video footage was referenced but apparently not released online.  A news story about a prison inmate plotting to castrate and kill Justin Bieber was discussed at length.  The segment also touched upon David Tell's experience at the Patrice O'Neal benefit show, conspiracy theories (UFOs, JFK assassination), upcoming stand-up shows, and a highly inappropriate description of a Scooby-Doo Broadway production.  David Tell and possibly Sam Roberts were mentioned as guests, although the latter’s presence wasn't confirmed.

A largely free-flowing segment featured Opie, Anthony, and Bob Kelly. Bob Kelly lazily promoted his Helium Comedy Club appearance.  A significant portion focused on Jesse Jackson Jr.’s alleged misuse of campaign funds, mocking his appearance and speculating on his mental state, and his wife’s alleged involvement. This led to a discussion about capes.  The conversation included personal anecdotes, Bob Kelly's massage experiences (including alleged sexual encounters), a bizarre backstage story, and a discussion about the re-election of politicians despite allegations of criminal behavior, using Marion Barry as an example, touching upon race and hypocrisy.  Other topics included Cat Williams' retirement and return; Bob Kelly's thoughts on retirement; Jimmy's fictional characters (particularly "Jelly"); Jimmy's unusual behavior; Alan Combs' appearance; the government budget; the hosts' preferences in women; bodybuilding and steroid use; experiences at strip clubs (with graphic descriptions); television viewing habits (mentioning *Pawn Stars*, *Storage Wars*, *Jungle Gold*, *Hotel Impossible*, *Bar Rescue*, *Wicked Tuna*, *Alaska State Troopers*, etc.); and explicit comments about racial preferences in women. The segment concluded with plugs for upcoming shows and appearances, accompanied by off-color jokes and banter.

A final segment focused on sex, relationships, and the adult film industry.  It included anecdotes about the antiques business, crude comments about reality TV, a call-in segment with transgender adult film actress Bailey Jay who answered questions about her sex life, the adult film industry, and reactions to her identity, extensive discussion of erectile dysfunction medication and various sexual acts and fetishes in the porn industry, listener questions regarding sexual problems (erectile dysfunction, orgasm, cuckolding), advice on comedic writing from Jim Norton, and suggestions on finding escorts from Jim Norton.  Throughout, there was vulgar language, sexual innuendo, and explicit discussion of sexual topics.  Bob Kelly's upcoming shows and the Patrice O'Neal benefit were briefly mentioned.  The show concluded with Jim Norton answering listener calls about threesomes and a caller who had sex with his cousin, detailing his sexual addiction.  The segment included a sponsored Dollar Shave Club advertisement awkwardly read by Norton and a final plug by Bailey Jay for her website.

[00:03:00]  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Ice kill.  How may I sit?  That is not good. 
[00:03:30]  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you somehow find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids. 
[00:04:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Let's remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:04:30]  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Clean him hard.  Hello!  Hello!  Clean him hard.  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:05:00]  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  How's everybody doing?  After the big comedy show.  A little tired, right?  Yeah.  It's a tired show. 
[00:05:30]  Indeed he do.  But that's okay.  I wanted to go out last time.  They all went to the stand or something to hang out.  But I literally was too tired.  Tuckered out?  Jim Norton was tuckered out?  I was tuckered out.  We're talking about the Patrice O'Neill Benefit Show, which was a huge, huge success.  Yes.  Last night.  Thank you to everyone that attended.  And thank you to everyone that tried to attend.  And thank you to everyone that just had good, solid fucking thoughts about the whole thing.  That was good, man.  Yeah, man.  Very fucking funny. 
[00:06:00]  I was telling Anthony, you guys all, fuck, you guys all have all just honed your fucking stand-up.  Because I haven't seen all you guys in one place in a while.  Right.  One after another, just killing it.  Holy fuck.  It didn't feel like it went on too long either.  No, man.  Because it was like a short set, 15 minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  It pushed a two, it pushed almost three hours.  Did it really?  Almost, yeah.  Two hours.  Two hours.  Two forty.  Yeah, but it didn't feel like it.  Wow.  Because the pacing, everyone was just boom, boom, boom.  There was what, ten comics at least? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  All doing ten to fifteen?  Yeah, nobody really went over it, but more than like a minute.  No.  I mean, people really respected the clock.  Yeah.  A countdown clock, it's just too incriminating.  It really is.  Everyone sees it.  From the stage, you could see, when you're on, you could see like up, there's different levels.  It's a beautiful room, city center.  Yeah, yeah.  And you could see you have two monitors, left and right, above your eyeline, and you can't not see your clock.  And you just look like a dick if you go past zero, right?  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  The monitor turns red.  Yes.  And starts counting up, because it counts down.  Right.  And once it hits zero, it's supposed to be up.  This is how long you've been an asshole.  And then it starts counting up.  Yes.  You've been an asshole for...  For two minutes.  Now you've been an asshole for three.  Yes.  It really is hard to get around that.  Regular comedy show, whatever, but when you've got so many guys waiting to go on, you just can't fucking do it.  Like, ironically enough, the one guy that would have fucked everybody would be Patrice O'Neal.  Oh, yeah.  I was thinking that, too. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  But if one guy would have ignored that clock and yammered over everybody, it would have been that dummy.  Yeah.  It was really nice.  It was a great event.  Bill Burr did a great job.  Tremendous, man.  Maureen, behind the scenes, who most of you don't know, but she did a great job, really, coordinating the whole thing.  It was just sad because, you know, you know why you're there.  Sure.  It was cool, but it was also like, oh, man.  Yeah, there's always that underlying thing, but...  Kind of in the air, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  But it was good to, you know, hang out, see everybody in one place like that. 
[00:08:00]  Absolutely.  Very funny.  Those posters are amazing.  They did a great job.  Do they sell out on the posters?  If not, I mean...  They're available online.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know they sold a ton of them, because I was helping selling them before the show.  Right.  And we sold a ton of them.  Yeah.  And then there was a big line when we left, too.  Oh, okay.  So they sold a lot of them.  I don't know if they sold...  But they're also...  It's not just a poster, man.  They got an artist that...  Danny did all that, right?  Danny did a great job.  Yeah, he hooked up with the artist and...  An artist that just doesn't do a lot of stuff. 
[00:08:30]  But they're putting on eBay a couple...  They got a couple posters, I believe, signed by everybody who did the show.  Nice.  Great right there.  Five purple and five...  Gold.  Gold, I guess it was, right?  Gold that we all signed.  And those are going to go up for auction.  Very cool.  Yeah.  I got a purple one, I think.  Bobby actually was smart.  Bobby bought a gold one.  Because, you know, everything was for the family.  So...  Will Sylvain made shirts.  Right.  Those were fucking great.  They were fucking great. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I got two mediums, which I think might have been wishful thinking.  I'm getting cocky.  But one of them was...  And I love the one.  One of them had black...  With white silhouette or something.  And one had like a...  What, I guess white shirt with black writing?  It was white with black writing, right.  It was Patrice's face.  And what did it say?  I'm better than you.  I'm better than you.  Great shirt.  In quotes.  Yeah.  Great shirt.  I was helping him out because he thought he could sell them in the venue.  And they said, no way.  So he was basically selling them out the back door. 
[00:09:30]  So he needed my help to tweet.  So he was selling them in a real shady way.  He's like, hey, man.  Can you tweet?  That'll be on...  What was it?  50...  It would have been, I guess, 56.  Yeah, whatever.  Why wouldn't they let him?  At the back door.  He's selling these shirts.  You know how the fucking venues are.  It's just scumbags.  Charity event.  Even for a charity event.  They're going to get their piece?  Those shitheads?  It's their taste.  You've got to give them the taste.  Well, if Will needs trouble selling those shirts, I'll certainly help him out.  There's a website that I tweeted. 
[00:10:00]  It's...  Shit.  I should help him out.  Yeah, go ahead.  They're not on sale yet, but patriceoneal.bigcartel.com.  The posters that are left over will go on sale.  Okay.  It's on Facebook, too.  And then the t-shirts that Jimmy is talking about, it's, uh, I'm better than you.  Don't spell out you.  Just the letter you.  I'm better than you dot com.  All right?  I didn't know that was from an artist that doesn't do a lot of stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:10:30]  The poster?  Oh, yeah.  Limited edition.  Because Will tells me to promote this website for him, and then everyone goes to the website  and says sold out, because he assumed it would just be sold out because he would have sold  his t-shirts at the venue.  Yeah, yeah.  But they weren't sold out.  Yeah, Will's an idiot.  Will's an idiot.  Black star.  Black star.  Yeah, black star.  Black star.  Will's just...  Yeah, he did a poem.  For Patrice, but he didn't write it down, and it was on his iPhone, and then his iPhone  turned off halfway through his dramatic reading of black star, and then he had to reset his 
[00:11:00]  phone.  It was, uh, quite a moment.  Yeah.  It was a special moment.  Oh, the way backstage, I'll just, uh, what?  Keith Robinson wouldn't let it go.  Black star.  Whoever walked backstage, black star, black star.  Then he was starting with white knees, white knees.  He was just going with it.  That was a very fun event.  Absolutely.  There was, uh, one guy in the front row that kept falling asleep, and a bunch of the comics  kept pointing him out. 
[00:11:30]  Jess, on the car ride home, said she felt like that was Patrice's spirit fucking with people.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Big black dude falling asleep.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Big black dude, fast asleep in the front.  Fast asleep.  Oh, fuck.  That's pretty good.  I don't know how you sleep through that.  I've been to a few comedy shows where, yeah, you want to fall asleep.  But not that one.  Holy fuck.  Like, the rhythm and the pacing that you guys all had was just right on.  Yeah.  It moved right the hell along.  Voss, uh, yeah, no one bombed.  I mean, uh, Voss hosted. 
[00:12:00]  And, uh, we should have, you know, we should have signed to sell a couple of the, uh, those  sheets that give you the, uh, the times on them.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are they called those sheets in the back?  Because they had the lineup.  Oh, right, right.  I thought we should have signed a couple of those.  Yeah.  Because fans don't usually get those things.  It's like a song list almost.  Sure.  But, uh, who was it?  Voss hosted.  Bobby destroyed up front.  Bob Kelly was coming in today.  He really did destroy up front.  Uh, Keith killed after Bobby.  It was Bobby Keith.  And then, um... 
[00:12:30]  Will.  It was Will.  Marina.  Marina Franklin.  Uh, Ian Edwards, who a lot of the fans don't know, but he's really funny.  Ian is a funny fucking guy.  Uh, he killed, uh...  I don't know him either.  Oh, you don't know Ian?  No, he was friends with Patrice.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We know Ian from fucking years and years and years.  So what, he just, uh, he's in L.A. or something?  L.A. now, yeah.  And he writes, too.  Right.  Um, he's a great writer, as well as being a really, really good comic, and he came back  just for this.  Really?  He came back from L.A. just for this? 
[00:13:00]  I believe so, yeah.  Patrice knew him for years.  Nice.  And, um, it was...  Who else was on it?  I mean, Colin was on it, myself.  Yeah, Colin was great.  Attell.  Attell.  Uh, Bill Burr.  Bill Burr closed it out.  Bill didn't want to close it, but he's like, I don't think I put myself, because he didn't.  Uh, but he was great.  I mean, uh, just through solid all the way through.  Yep.  Absolutely.  All the way through.  Yep.  And, uh, Patrice's mother was there, and his sister, and, uh, and Vaughn.  Oh, yeah, there's a picture of us all on the stage. 
[00:13:30]  O.P. and Anthony, of course, went up first.  A big pic.  Yeah, we just went out and said hi, really.  It was nice.  It was nice to be a part of it.  That's a great room, right?  It's an amazing room.  The seats, like the balcony seats, they, they look like they're going to fall on your head.  Is it exciting to get a look at where the lights are?  Oh, you had to see with the lights on.  It's an amazing place.  Those seats are tight, close to the stage, even up high.  That's where we sat.  We were up high on the balcony, but it was like right, it was right over the stage.  Did you feel like you could fall right on the stage? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Me and Bill Burr were talking about that because he's a big hockey guy, too.  And when I used to go to hockey games in Buffalo, I think it was the odd, you would go up to, you know, I didn't have any fucking money.  So if I went to a hockey game, I went to the nosebleeds.  And you would find yourself leaning back to go down the stairs to go get a beer because it was that steep.  Yeah.  And then that place had that feel, old school, that steepness to it.  Yeah, there's a picture of us on the stage.  And you can kind of see, I looked at it, like I did acknowledge it, but I was so wanting to take the picture before anybody left. 
[00:14:30]  We were trying to get everybody together, and we actually did, which I can't believe we got everybody together.  Yeah.  That's a cool little group shot.  Patrice's mom in the middle.  Patrice's mom is young, huh?  Yeah, he was 41.  I would not say he would be 43, so.  I think she had him around 18 or so.  Yeah, she's probably 61, 62.  That's it?  Yeah, she's not old.  I mean, and his, and Vaughn was there. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  And in the short dress.  Mm-hmm.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  It's a good dress for Vaughn.  Oof.  Shows off all her lovely body parts.  Attributes.  You try not to look, but holy fuck.  I don't, you know.  She's going to advertise like that.  My God, man.  I look, and it's like.  You have to look, obviously, but.  He wouldn't care.  No.  He would understand.  Someone said, you know, it's like, well, she wears very sexy clothes.  It's like, yeah, that's why Patrice liked her. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, exactly.  She's like, what the fuck?  Talks about going to Brazil together.  She's supposed to wear a fucking, you know, black veil around.  Jesus.  Wow, man.  Yeah.  She was put together nice.  Real nice.  His stepdaughter.  Mm-hmm.  And Patrice's sister was there, too.  She's not in the picture.  But she was the girl upstairs who looked like Patrice.  Oh, yeah, man.  Mm-hmm.  Her smile, her mouth is like Patrice when she smiles.  She has a thing with her.  Is she quiet?  She can be, yeah.  I don't know her well.  I met her in a hospital.  Is she kind of loud like Patrice was? 
[00:16:00]  No, she's not, no.  I mean that in a good way, by the way.  Okay.  But no, she's quiet.  But I saw her at the end of the night last night, and we said hello.  And yeah, she just reminds me of him a lot in her mouth and in her face.  They're about the same age, too, right?  I don't know.  I'm going to guess you.  A couple years apart?  I think so, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  But then you see him and his mom, too.  You see his mom.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, God almighty.  That makes it a little tough.  Yeah.  You kind of feel like you're seeing Patrice all over again.  That complex is daunting when you're trying to find your way from, like, the dressing room 
[00:16:30]  to the stage.  It was like a maze.  Like Spinal Tap?  Yes.  You got all lost in shit.  I was walking around trying to find me on an elevator.  It was like fucking Mario Brothers.  You find anything cool back there?  No.  No.  I'm walking around.  It's like a bunch of people looking at you like, what the fuck are you doing in this  part of the building?  And you're like, I don't know.  I have no idea.  I'm walking around.  I'm trying to find a fucking dressing room or the stage.  One or the other would be nice.  It was impossible. 
[00:17:00]  I guess that place is used for what?  Like, they had the ballet there or some shit.  And then some fan shows me a picture from the lobby.  Right.  From just, like, two or three days ago.  Right.  And he's got a picture with Tom Skerritt.  Really?  Right there in the fucking lobby.  Wow.  Two days ago?  I guess a couple of days ago, Tom Skerritt was there, seeing whatever was there.  Tom Skerritt.  Oh.  He was there.  Do you know he's 79 years old? 
[00:17:30]  Who is a fan?  Tom Skerritt is 79.  He looks good for 79.  I think you're obsessed with Tom Skerritt.  What?  It's crazy.  There was an article about him yesterday, too.  I guess they're putting Top Gun out in 3D.  What?  Yeah.  I thought they were just making another movie.  Nah, they're putting it out in 3D, I guess.  They decide, fuck the other movie, let's just make this one in 3D?  Maybe they're going to do both, but I don't know.  But the old one they're putting out in 3D, and I guess they were talking to Tom Skerritt about it. 
[00:18:00]  You think that'll look cool?  I'll watch it.  I'm trying to remember if those scenes would hold up, first of all.  Well, I'm looking forward to feeling like I'm immersed in that volleyball game.  No kidding.  Now you're talking.  That's the 3D part.  That's what I'm psyched for.  See those bulges and all their glory.  Hey, how was CNN?  We got the tape here.  Me and Jimmy have to listen to this.  Oh, you do?  Yes, we have to listen to it. 
[00:18:30]  It ain't much.  Well, because they were trying to, like, spin it.  Well, I think she was hoping I was going to be a stark-raving lunatic.  Right.  And, you know.  She was probably warned about you.  Kind of early.  When we were listening on the after show, our observations were that it seemed like,  she didn't want to accuse you of anything so that she could step back and say, hey, whoa.  I said that.  Yeah.  Because she was doing the thing that Jim always points out where she goes, well, people have  said that.  Yeah.  Oh, that's crap. 
[00:19:00]  What opinions are that?  So, next time they do that, you got to go, which people?  What people is that?  What people are those?  Exactly.  Give me names.  People.  What are you talking about?  And I point out to Anthony that that's the famous lady that's in the Chad clip.  Chad!  Yeah.  You got to talk to that lady.  Because she was in Atlanta.  Do you have that clip, Chad?  She was in Atlanta and I was in New York, of course.  So, they did that thing where, you know, I got the city behind me to show that I'm in  New York.  What part of the city? 
[00:19:30]  It was just, you know, a chunk of Manhattan.  And, yeah, I was on kind of the other screen, kind of doing that whole thing.  But, yeah, and then Opie reminded me that that's who I was talking to.  Yeah, man.  She's famous to us.  I'd have said something.  Filled in with some air.  Okay, so, Chad.  But, Camille.  Chad.  Let me talk, Carol.  Translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well, if you would let me talk.  Camille.  Camille was 908. 
[00:20:00]  And so, this is actually now not as strong.  In the Northern Hemisphere, unless you were obviously trying to get under a hurricane.  All right.  Thank you, Chad.  All right.  Just having fun with you this morning.  No.  Did he throw his paper down?  It is.  Yes, he was very angry.  No, he's not just having fun with her.  He wanted to call her a C.  A cunt.  Yes.  He wasn't having fun.  His big Katrina day with the weather.  And he's trying to give barometric pressure.  And she'd had it.  I've never looked at him differently.  Oh, no.  I mean, it's the same, I should say. 
[00:20:30]  No, he's.  He grabbed his papers and he's shaking them.  He's the go-to guy, though, now on CNN for anything weather-related.  Even with the cruise ship, he was explaining how it's going to be hard to get into Mobile, Alabama, because of the currents and this and that.  And he just loves it.  But don't interrupt him.  Chad.  Chad.  So condescending.  How great is that?  You say that every time you see him on TV.  Absolutely.  In my head, I just say, Chad. 
[00:21:00]  It's Chad.  Here's Anne talking about drones on CNN.  They're stunning, aren't they?  They're gorgeous still.  It is a drone and it can get a lot closer to these homes on Long Island.  It's all up to the operator, in this case, Anthony Cumia.  And Anthea joins us now from New York.  Good morning.  Hi.  Good morning.  First of all, tell us how you operate your drone.  Do you have a special room in your house?  How does that work?  Yeah, I got a room in my house. 
[00:21:30]  What?  I got a bunker in my house.  Why don't news people know basic shit?  I don't know.  I guess she's a...  I've never flown one, but I just know you don't have to have a special room in your house.  I guess, yeah, everybody...  You know what it is, because everybody thinks a Predator drone.  Yeah, but she's on the news, so she should know that.  She should have done a little research.  And it helps the story.  Like, look, you don't even need a special room.  You could just go outside and start flying this fucking thing.  Exactly.  I wish you had lied and just told her, yeah, I have a... 
[00:22:00]  I know.  You know something?  I did the most generic interview here.  It was, you know, almost like a man-cow phone call that I did.  You need to do some lying, though.  I could have...  Remember old school when we had to talk about the water incident?  Yes.  Can we play that today, Tim?  Oh, boy.  That blew it for us, especially me.  That was it.  They won our expert opinion, and then we were going to be the expert guys on any radio story,  but we blew up our spot.  Yeah.  With What's-Her-Name, who we actually really liked. 
[00:22:30]  I've seen her in the neighborhood since.  She will not say hi to me anymore.  One from MTV.  Yeah.  We used to be friendly toward each other, but she knows that we purposely blew up our spot.  Yes.  I remember that now.  They had Anthony on the phone.  I'm on another phone.  Oh, boy.  What was that for?  For the...  We for we?  Yeah.  The lady that fucking died from drinking too much water, so they went to the expert.  It's us.  And Anthony's just fucking quoting weird, just fucking shit that was, you know, hot on our 
[00:23:00]  show at the time.  Yeah.  That was bad.  We got this?  Fuck it.  How long is this?  It looks like it might be the audio of you guys playing it back.  I'm not...  Oh, really?  Do you have it, DRock?  I'm looking for it.  All right.  Look.  If you find it, let me know.  Let's go back to Ann on CNN yesterday.  Well, it can be remotely operated with a regular radio control unit that you'd see people using  with a toy model, airplanes and whatnot.  Or it can be autonomously programmed to go to a preset location, carry out whatever you 
[00:23:30]  want it to do.  In my case, it's photography.  And then return to where it came from.  In my case, it's photography.  I just want to make sure everyone knows it's photography.  I am a creep.  In my case, it's photography.  I was covering my ass already.  Do you believe them, Jimmy?  It's photography.  Oh!  I'm a professional photographer now.  In my case, photography.  In my case, photography.  Yeah.  I like to send this drone up into the sky to take pictures. 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  In my case, pretty much terrorizing my Jewish neighbors while this thing buzzes up and  down the street.  I don't know what they think.  They're driving their cars.  They're trying to park their cars.  And this thing is buzzing up and down the street.  Just buzzing.  Just making its rounds.  Yes.  Its daily rounds.  Making the rounds.  It really is.  Yeah.  It was going around the...  I sent it around the block.  Do you announce to your empty house, all clear? 
[00:24:30]  All clear!  All clear.  Just checking people's paperwork up and down the block.  Right.  I sent it around the block.  And you see people, like, one guy is walking his dog.  But they don't look at it all angrily.  Do you really just send it right down the street?  Yeah.  Like low?  Down the old street.  A couple feet.  A couple hundred feet off the ground?  I like keeping it above the treetops.  Yeah.  A couple hundred, right?  Nice.  So, but yeah, I sent it around the block.  But you can see the people that are, like, out. 
[00:25:00]  They look at it, but they're smiling.  Because they're kind of like, oh, wow, that's cool.  That's something, you know.  Right.  I don't know what it is, but it kind of looks cool.  So, we're old enough to see a few of those dumb little helicopters in here.  They think it's probably one of those things.  Yeah.  Just kind of a little toy roaming around the neighborhood.  They have no idea what that could accomplish.  Meanwhile, I'm looking at them.  In my case, photography.  In my case.  You want to hear that again?  I certainly do.  In my case.  In my case, photography. 
[00:25:30]  No, why?  Because it's so not believable.  I know.  It was like, I was just lying.  In my case, photography.  I was just lying.  Go to a preset location, carry out whatever you want it to do.  In my case, it's photography.  And then return to where it came from.  Either way, you can view where it's going and what it's doing through a monitor system  that's on the drone itself and has a video downlink that I could watch as it's cruising  through the neighborhood or wherever I deem to send it. 
[00:26:00]  So, is it difficult to operate?  It's not easy, but it's not very hard.  With a few hundred dollars, you could get one to practice on before you want to send  a few thousand dollars up on six propellers.  It's relatively simple.  It's more than a toy, but less than you would see something that would be firing Hellfire missiles.  I just want to, what a very interesting, for a photography habit, you buy a practice drone. 
[00:26:30]  You buy a practice drone and get used to it, and then you buy the really good one.  For photography.  In my case, it's photography.  All right.  Which I had the small drone that I had gotten, which was like 300 bucks, and it had a camera  on it, and you flew it with your iPad, but it was very easy, and you could kind of get  the physics of one of these quadcopters down. 
[00:27:00]  For your photography.  For your photography.  In your case, photography.  And in my case, photography, I knew all of you motherfuckers.  He's trying to make people think you're Anthony Adams over there.  Yes, that's my defense.  The Ansel Adams defense.  Yes.  But less than you would see something that would be firing Hellfire missiles from it.  Thank goodness.  So you're part of Opie and Anthony, which means you're kind of a shock jock. 
[00:27:30]  You know what?  Here we go.  I will say this every time.  Go fuck yourself.  We're fucking way smarter than you.  Shut the fuck up.  Opie!  Opie!  Now, Chad!  It's just lazy.  It's lazy.  It's enraging.  We're way smarter than this fucking broad, but she'll fucking, you know, look down upon  us and say, shock jocks.  Talk circles around you, you stupid broad.  It's just a lazy summation. 
[00:28:00]  It's infuriating, right, at this point?  A lazy summation.  Maybe 10, 12 years ago, maybe.  Even though back then, in between our nonsense, we were having some good discussions.  Yeah.  You can't shock anyone anymore.  We've been saying that for years.  Yeah.  The term shock jock is so gone.  So it goes back to Jimmy, which makes it lazy.  You're a photographer.  You should have cleared that up.  I really should have.  In my case, photography.  More importantly, is Piazza doing a comb-over these days? 
[00:28:30]  I don't think he's doing a comb-over.  He looks like he's wearing a burn victim wig.  They just showed him, and...  I gotta see what he looks like these days.  I don't know.  There's something going on there.  Does he still hang out with Eddie Trunk?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe Eddie can clear that up.  We've seen Mike Piazza in social circumstances.  He's a really nice guy.  Very nice dude.  Very solid dude.  Down to earth.  Normal.  Loves that metal.  Loves that metal.  Oh, he does.  I'm ranting about us not being shock jocks, knowing that a mere week ago we had guys basically  blowing each other. 
[00:29:00]  That's kind of true.  So maybe I should shut my fucking mouth.  We ruined three out of four marriages that were in this room.  At least one.  You gotta think one fucking marriage is doomed.  For $40.  A $40 prize and a hat.  He's an O&A hat and $40.  For a lawyer.  Goodness.  So you're part of Opie and Anthony, which means you're kind of a shock jock, and that  you have a drone that can fly over cities and maybe fly low over homes kind of like makes 
[00:29:30]  me nervous.  Well, yeah, I guess my neighbor's probably wondering what I'm doing, but there's still  an expectation of privacy there that I'm respecting, and it is the law.  You can't just cover these things in front of people's windows and start taking video.  But you wouldn't need to, because in your case it's photography.  You would just take pictures.  In my case.  In your case.  Photography.  It's photography.  In my case, it's photography.  Fucking boo. 
[00:30:00]  I've never...  I've been working with you for years, and I've never heard you say, I want to take a picture  of that.  Well, not on the ground.  That's true.  See, that's the whole thing.  That's true.  I am a photographer from the air.  Aerial photographer.  I am an aerial photographer.  Yeah.  I love the technology.  I love video.  And to be able to get these angles that you could never get from a handheld camera is really  amazing, and that it is available to civilians at this point, it's actually exciting to take 
[00:30:30]  video from something that's so high up.  I've gone to the World's Fair grounds and taken video of inside the observation decks  up there.  I'm waiting for the wind to calm down.  It's just fascinating to be able to get this up-close video from pretty inaccessible  places.  It's just amazing.  Apparently, you can fly these things legally up to 400 feet, so you're well within the bounds 
[00:31:00]  of the law.  Whoops.  Some people...  Excuse me.  Oh, my God.  She thinks you only fly at 400 feet.  Whoops.  400 feet?  You actually have a picture of Sully waving it from the cockpit.  Fuck.  What are you talking about?  You're not within 400 feet.  Did you tell her you were doing only 400 feet?  No.  He just didn't correct it.  I guess she looked at the video and saw that that video is probably somewhere in the realm  of...  And I'm not blowing up your spot.  I mean, all you have to do is go to your YouTube channel, and you could see that maybe 
[00:31:30]  you're pushing the 400 feet limit.  And who knows where that video's from?  No.  You're taking photos of interstellar space with that fucking thing.  You see the curvature of the Earth.  What is he talking about?  Well, it might have gotten away from me one day.  That's pretty much...  All right.  Fair enough.  The only, you know...  Might have gotten away and kept climbing for 15 straight minutes.  Do they got...  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that was bad.  Do they got...  Is it really a 400 foot limit they got? 
[00:32:00]  In certain areas.  You know, if you're out in the middle of nowhere, then no one's going to give a shit.  Well, you're sort of out in the middle of everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  What?  You're sort of in the path of every fucking jet airliner that needs to go to MacArthur.  Very safe.  Very safe piloting of the remotely piloted, remotely piloted vehicle.  Well, in your case.  In my case, photography.  For photography.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Mike thinks, oh, hey, I don't like this whole scene.  It's just too easy to spy on me with this kind of technology available to just like the everyday guy on the street. 
[00:32:30]  At some point, do you think that drones should be regulated by local governments, state governments, the feds?  I'm the last person to say anything for regulation and legislation.  But I can see these things getting into some situations that might be a little dangerous.  The potential for evil use is definitely out there. 
[00:33:00]  But it shouldn't interfere with people that want to use it for surveying their land if they have a lot of land.  Hold on a second.  I want to listen to this.  To 1750 Anthony surveying their land.  Look.  People survey land.  You're turning it to a prospector in front of our eyes.  Well, you know, I want to say, you know, in my case, it's for staking a claim and sifting for gold.  Seeing if there's any runaway slaves.  Surveying the land? 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  There are many people that own a lot of land.  And perhaps they don't want to go out and physically have to look over this land.  Meanwhile, they could send this out.  But that's not your case.  Look.  You're not a photographer.  And you're not surveying any land.  I wasn't saying that in my case, surveying land.  I said in my case, photography.  But in my case, surveying land would not have been true.  But in someone else's case, they would have said, in my case, surveying land. 
[00:34:00]  Keep spinning.  I am.  Surveying.  Surveying land.  They would look to see if maybe their cattle is still in the proper fenced-in area for breaks in barbed wire fences that need repairing.  Instead of having to go out, you could send it out and survey your land.  You're surveying for something else, sir. 
[00:34:30]  Huh?  You're surveying for something else.  No.  You're technically surveying your land.  Call me Gold Rush Anthony.  If they have a lot of land, obviously law enforcement or private security firms might want to use these for surveillance of some sort.  Surveillance of some sort.  And videographers.  I mean, like I said, it's a great, exciting way to get angles on video that you couldn't.  But, yeah, the opportunity is there for some maybe not-too-legal or not-too-ethical things to do.  But, again, that's human nature, isn't it? 
[00:35:00]  It's human nature.  That's why it scares so many people.  I suspect one day that lawmakers will, I don't know, at least have rules and regulations in place as to how you can use your drone specifically.  Yeah, that seems to be what they do best.  Sometimes.  Anthony Coomey of Opie and Anthony, thank you so much for sharing.  Thank you.  Thank you, Carol.  Look at me.  That's my CNN appearance.  Of course, tonight I'm on Red Eye on Fox News where I can have a little fun. 
[00:35:30]  And, you know, spread my wings a little bit.  I'm surprised Anthony doesn't put you on for that.  Are they talking about drones?  Because they don't do the American panel anymore.  What happened to the American panel?  I don't know.  I like it better this way, actually.  Yeah.  Oh, you got the clip?  Yeah, if you want, I have your last appearance on MSNBC.  Yeah, they were hoping that we were going to be the go-to guys for the radio stories.  And we just decided not to have at it.  It was a career opportunity.  Why not blow it up?  Yeah.  And then Ann had a few lines and I just, it just threw me completely off my heart. 
[00:36:00]  What the fuck?  All right, yeah, this is what?  Hold your wee for a wee?  Yeah.  And they need to talk to some shock jocks.  The Sacramento County Sheriff's Department has opened a criminal investigation into the death of a California woman who drank...  How many years ago?  ...too much water.  Jennifer Strange drank as much as two gallons of water during a radio show stunt to win a popular gaming station...  ...system, excuse me.  The sheriff is considering filing charges after hearing part of the radio show broadcast. 
[00:36:30]  How much water do you think you can drink before you have to wee?  I did, like, two gallons.  Two gallons?  Oh, dude.  Can't you get water poisoning and, like, die?  So far, I don't want water.  Your body is 98% water.  Why can't you take in as much water as you want?  I don't know.  Maybe we should have researched this.  I don't know.  I mean, yeah.  Maybe we should have researched that more.  Shortly after that part of the conversation on January 12th, a nurse called in warning of the dangers of drinking too much water.  The radio station has now fired 10 employees, including three of the morning show disc jockeys. 
[00:37:00]  Openie and Anthony are a nationally syndicated radio host, also on XM Satellite Radio, two of the best known in the business.  They're joining us now on the phone.  Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.  Thanks for having us, Allison.  Hey, Opie, so as two people who do provocative radio for a living, what did you think when you first heard this story about this woman dying from drinking that much water during this stunt?  Well, obviously, I feel bad for Jennifer and her family, but I also feel bad for the show because they're just kind of a wacky morning show. 
[00:37:30]  They're not really shock jocks or edgy.  They were just kind of having a little fun, and it blew up kind of a big fun.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I feel bad.  Anthony, what did you think when you first?  I'm doing Steve lines.  That's terrible, but I'm sorry.  I forgot about this.  Holy shit, did we talk to her?  And she was nothing but nice to us over the years.  All we were trying to do is get lines in from the show.  We did a sit-down interview with her for something. 
[00:38:00]  I don't remember what anymore, but we would see her out and about, and she just liked us.  We haven't talked to her since, and like I said, I've seen her in the neighborhood, and she refuses to say hi.  Can you back it up slightly?  You're just terrible.  This is where it begins, where it just decides to blow it up.  I don't think going into this, I knew you were going with that angle, and then I was like, all right, fuck it.  I don't know.  Let's do this.  It didn't even make sense, because I just said, that's terrible. 
[00:38:30]  I'm sorry.  Out of nowhere.  Like, why would I say that?  Did we discuss this on the air that we were going to blow it up?  I think we did, kind of.  I was just going to do show lines.  I don't remember.  All right.  Play this.  Just kind of having, kind of having a little fun in it.  Kind of having fun.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I feel bad.  Anthony, what did you think when you first heard this?  It was awful.  You know, these poor kids of the mother are going to be asked for the rest of their life,  you know, how would your parents die, you know?  Or your parents die. 
[00:39:00]  How did your parents die?  It's another Steve line.  I know what it is.  I like how you corrected it.  How did your parents die?  How did your parents die?  Yeah, but we have new listeners.  They've got to understand, these are lines that we were saying, ad nauseum.  Yes, everything out of my mouth is a fucking line from the show.  I don't think I did one legitimate line.  Ridiculous story of, you know, a radio stunt.  So, Opia, so what at this point in the story, if anything, points to the radio host's responsibility 
[00:39:30]  for this woman's death or absolves him from it?  Uh, that's a good question.  It's good, yeah.  It's going to be tough to get out of this one.  You really don't sign up to kill a listener when you do a radio show.  That's funny.  You really don't sign up to kill a listener.  That's just nonsense from us.  And you chuckled beforehand. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, because, no.  I kill a listener.  I'm still laughing at you, because now I'm realizing what you're doing.  Yeah.  I'm like, holy fuck.  It's just doing lines.  Yeah.  Be screwed.  Yeah, I was listening to you guys this morning, and one of the, you played a clip from this show,  and one of the guys was like, hey, she signed a release.  Does that, she signed a release excuse hold, in your opinion?  No, I think legally it might hold, but, um, uh, so they don't get, uh, arrested. 
[00:40:30]  But I think civil, a civil case will be, uh, brought up.  And it reminds me, it was a case, uh, years ago, back in 83, a couple of disc jockeys.  I think it was Ramon and Frankis in the morning.  Uh, they had a staff member.  Ramon and Frankis in the morning.  This is why we've never been asked back.  And you know what, in the end, I don't give a fuck.  I really don't.  Oh, great.  In 83.  In 83.  And you hear her, she's like, I listen, I was listening to you this morning, 
[00:41:00]  like she was a fan.  Oh, no, it was terrible.  She trusted us.  It's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Fucking radio show, babes.  Ramon and Frankis in the morning.  How did your parents, how did your parents die?  How did your parents die?  Are you a parent?  Ramon and Frankis.  In 83, a couple of disc jockeys, I think it was Ramon and Frankis in the morning.  Uh, they had a staff member who shoved marshmallows in his mouth.  And, uh, he choked.  Um, wearing a bunny suit.  It was awful. 
[00:41:30]  That was in our fatty pig fatty state.  That was, uh, the chubby bunny.  Oh, chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny with E-Rock.  It was referencing that there.  Fragic.  The, um, Nagel family's never recovered from that.  And, uh, you know, I remember they were taken right off the air.  So, Opie, do you think this is going to bring any, any industry-wide changes? 
[00:42:00]  Or is this just going to be one of these sad stories that sort of fades from the headlines  eventually?  Uh, no, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, I think the boss is going to, you know, uh, kind of.  Pause.  I do have to explain.  I, I am out of my mind because of what I just said. 
[00:42:30]  Yes.  I fucking forgot what I wanted to say.  You're just stammering at this point.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I'm just amazed that this is going down this way.  Go back to my staring.  It's always fun.  Sure.  That's great.  Uh, well, I, I, I, I don't even, I remember that I don't even remember the question.  Right.  Yeah.  Because I was too busy laughing inside about what the fuck you were doing at that point.  Go ahead.  I think the boss is going to, you know, uh, kind of, kind of pretty much, uh, wreck it 
[00:43:00]  for everybody else.  I mean, the bosses in radio in general are beyond scared as it is.  And, uh, now that we officially have killed the listener out there.  Yeah.  I think you're going to hear a lot of really, really boring radio.  No one's going to really try to go to the, go to the edge or, uh, do anything edgy.  Well, Anthony.  Didn't a, didn't a management maybe say, Hey, did you talk to a doctor about this or something?  And maybe, uh, get some confirmation that this is dangerous.  That is a stacker two reference. 
[00:43:30]  Did you talk to your doctor about a stacker two?  Oh, this is terrible.  It's only terrible because she's really one of the good ones.  Did you talk to your doctor about a stacker two?  How did your parents die?  In this case, your parent.  What?  It's nonsense.  It's just idiocy.  It doesn't mean you're throwing it up the food chain a little bit that management maybe 
[00:44:00]  should get involved and maybe should be held accountable.  Yeah.  Maybe you say, you know, did you talk to your doctor about this or something, you know,  uh, maybe management should have looked into this and seen if it was a little more dangerous  than they thought.  I think Anthony, we really thank you for taking the time to be with us today.  Thank you, Allison.  Thank you, Allison.  Thank you, Allison.  Thank you, Allison.  Allison.  You can hear by the end of it, she doesn't want to thank us. 
[00:44:30]  She's had it.  But she's on live TV.  You can hear the thank you was not sincere.  And that was it.  We never talked to her again, unfortunately.  Yeah.  She's out there somewhere.  We love you, Allison.  Oh, that's fucking great.  Hope you're doing well.  Hope you're doing well.  Where is she working now?  Still over there?  I haven't seen her on TV in a while.  No.  No.  Maybe she got shoved over to some local, uh, local small city thing.  That's always sad when you see somebody that was in New York and you're on a road trip 
[00:45:00]  somewhere and you're in Eastbound fucking.  It's like, hey, look, that's the weather guy from CBS in New York.  What happened?  Why is he over here now?  Why are you in Tuscaloosa?  Speaking of fucking news hackers, you've found this, uh,  what is his, what is his name?  Morrissey?  Morrison?  Oh my goodness.  The CBS guy.  Choking his wife and fucking, now they're saying he loved porn.  They're killing the guy.  Oh, this guy, guy's done, huh?  I don't know.  Well, CBS is pissed because he kind of lied to him why his face was all fucked up when he 
[00:45:30]  showed up at work.  Oh, did he?  What did he say?  He was trying to downplay the whole incident.  He said, I will kill her.  Right.  I'm reading this and the, and the cop and the, and that Oscar guy.  Ooh, a couple of bad ones.  Yeah.  Both, both, bless you.  Thank you.  They can't get enough of a blonde in danger on the cover of the Daily News.  Oh yeah.  They love it.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, did, did, did the fucking Daily News really go with not a leg to stand on?  Yeah.  Was their headline?  Oh, a few people tweeted that to me.  That's the Daily News. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  A few people tweeted that to me and I was embarrassed.  Ugh.  But now the paper's using that?  I'm surprised.  So I apologize to the people that tweeted that line to me.  Obviously a great line if the paper's using it.  I'm, I'm surprised there's no backlash yet.  But CBS anchor Morrison would kill his wife if released, court papers say.  Longtime New York anchorman Rob Morrison threatened he would kill his wife after cops arrested him for choking his fellow CBS journalist spouse in their Connecticut home.  Nice.  What the fuck happened?  He had a few drinks maybe?  Sunday morning while being booked by police, Morrison, 44, threatened that if he was released from police custody, he would kill his wife. 
[00:46:30]  He was fucking pissed, huh?  Yeah.  That threatened the allegations that Morrison used both hands to throttle 40-year-old Ashley, led a judge yesterday to continue to bomb Morrison from having any contact from his wife, visiting their house, or going within 100 yards of her except for their common workplace at WCBS TV.  So he's not allowed home yet.  Damn.  How embarrassing.  They work together in their front page news. 
[00:47:00]  How humiliating.  Yeah.  Husband-wife team, I think.  It sounds like she's like the co-anchor.  I'm not sure, though.  CBS?  Yeah.  Is CBS reporting on it?  Are they getting a camera in his face?  Yeah.  Why don't they just put a camera in his face when he walks in in the morning?  Right.  Tell us what happened.  Oh.  Do you have any comments about this allegations?  Did you talk to your doctor about your nose?  Exactly, you're doing.  Morrison is charged with strangulation, threatening, and disorderly conduct in Sunday's incident in which he allegedly choked Ashley during a fight. 
[00:47:30]  As their seven-year-old son slept at the house.  Damn.  He read a statement that he denied ever hurting Ashley.  I did not choke my wife.  I've never laid my hands on my wife.  She did a number on him.  It's bad enough when you have to say that.  Right.  I never laid a hand on her.  I was just as surprised by that particular chart as probably it was everyone else who's heard of the story. 
[00:48:00]  That's what he said.  Really?  I regret deeply how I acted toward the police department.  I did not show them the respect they deserved.  They were there to do a job.  There's a fine department.  They're a fine department.  They do a good job protecting the town in which I live, and I sincerely apologize to them.  Domestics are a tricky situation.  Yeah, they're the most dangerous.  Yeah.  For cops.  He's in a bit of trouble.  Yeah, I wonder why they're not putting the camera in his face like they would if it was Alec Baldwin.  Why aren't they treating him the way they treat Alec Baldwin? 
[00:48:30]  Right.  Yeah, what do you think of the Alec Baldwin story?  It's a non-story.  He's a guy who's...  Look, they have the right...  He's a public figure.  They just camp outside his house all the time.  They fucking hassle the guy all the time.  He's one of those guys that they just don't leave alone in New York because they know they're going to get good shit from him.  Yeah.  Because they know he could fly off the handle, so they're always around Alec Baldwin hoping for that fucking money shot, and they got it over the weekend.  The reaction becomes the story.  They make something happen.  They're just complete pieces of garbage.  I hope he fucking knocks one of their teeth out. 
[00:49:00]  I wish he would have choked that woman.  I really do.  And then he tweeted about the incident, how he was fucking pissed off at a photographer or the paparazzi, and then that guy read his tweet and then went back to his house.  And what was the racist part of it?  Apparently he said coon to...  This is what they're alleging.  Oh, the word he used to...  Yeah, coon.  And he said some...  And by the way, the guy he said it to, some guy that works for the Post, he's a photographer, and he used to be on the NYPD.  Right.  But he was a fucking... 
[00:49:30]  He worked in narcotics for 15 years, and he's going to cry that somebody used a racial stereotype?  Yeah.  Shut the fuck up.  You're in the guy's face.  This is not like he walked into a deli and hassled somebody and called him a coon.  You're fucking...  If he said something in anger while you're right there, you're all over him, shut up.  You're in it, baby.  You're in a shitty profession.  You should expect that some shit's going to be said to you, right?  Exactly.  I'm sick of the fucking...  Are you kidding me?  You're in everyone else's face bothering the hell out of them. 
[00:50:00]  Of course some of these guys are going to fucking react and say some shitty things back to you.  Of course they are.  It's such a feigned outrage and a forced...  He said something racial.  Oh, shut up.  Right.  Shut the fuck up.  Exactly.  God almighty.  So I don't know if anything will happen, but I have no problem with what he did.  I don't give a fuck, honestly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop.  And how about this?  Is his wife being sued?  I think there's a lawsuit.  His wife teaches a yoga class.  Well, some asshole in her class... 
[00:50:30]  I know this story.  Yeah.  He was trying to do a handstand or a headstand in one of these yoga fucking poses, and she  basically told him, you got to be careful, you're near a window, and he's one of these  fucking asshole New Yorkers.  We've all seen these guys like, ah, fuck you, I'm going to do it anyway.  And he fell backwards or frontwards, whatever, and his leg went flying through the fucking  window.  Jesus.  So now he's, like, suing her.  And she has a ton of witnesses, supposedly, that heard her say, look, that's not a good  idea.  Oh, he's saying it was crazy. 
[00:51:00]  Just another fucking...  Right.  I hate these fucking lawsuits.  So that led the paparazzi to go to Alec Baldwin's home, and there's Alec, of course, defending  his now wife.  Yeah.  The married.  Hilarious.  Yeah, but I think I understand.  But he wasn't even defending it.  He was just annoyed that they're asking.  It's like...  Of course.  They're just such vultures.  And meanwhile, this CBS guy is being accused of choking his wife.  Why aren't they in his face constantly?  Mm-hmm.  Mm.  That never makes sense.  Nah.  It leads us to Scott Brown. 
[00:51:30]  Travis saying it's his favorite story of the day.  Scott Brown is, uh, what?  Politician?  Massachusetts?  What is he officially?  Why would there be tissues?  Was he the governor?  Only ask for him.  Yeah, Scott Brown is what?  Where's Ant's tissues?  He asks for them every day.  I want tissues here.  Who sets up the studio?  Every day.  Every day.  He wants the same thing every day.  It's a brand new thing that I need every day.  Uh, during the winter.  It's a brand new day. 
[00:52:00]  I get very sniffly.  And if my nose is fucking stuffed or runny,  it takes me right out of the program.  In his case, it's allergies.  In my case.  You want some, uh, Starbucks napkins?  Those are pretty soft.  Those are great on the nostrils.  But you ask for the same thing every day.  And I said, could I have that here in the morning and stuff?  Tissue diva!  That's all coming up over here on Pal Talk.  Bunch of pricks.  Tissue diva!  Tissue diva!  How many divas have we had?  Oh, man.  Coffee divas.  Coffee divas number one. 
[00:52:30]  Coffee divas.  We've had potato diva.  Potato diva.  I remember that one.  Potato diva.  I remember that one.  Might have to play one of those production pieces at the break.  Milk diva.  Milk diva.  Milk diva, yes.  Which one haven't we played in a while?  Uh, there's also drill diva.  Drill.  Oh, that was when Jimmy got the drill.  Oh, right.  As a gift.  That was completely children.  What else was there?  Uh, bagel diva.  Bagel diva.  Yeah, you gotta play one of the divas that we haven't played in a while.  But one of the real ones, not one of the silly ones.  What was the coffee one? 
[00:53:00]  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Anyway, Scott Brown, yes.  Former Senator Scott Brown.  Dismisses buzz that he was drunk during late night Twitter outbursts.  So, he's on his Twitter.  He doesn't like what's being, uh, tweeted.  So he fucking goes after some of these guys, right?  Yep.  A bunch of us have been there before.  Sure.  He tweeted stuff like, whatever.  And then, whatever bud.  To another guy.  And then to another guy, whatever Michael. 
[00:53:30]  And then, uh, something.  BQ hate VWR.  I don't know exactly what that is.  Wait, what is it again?  BQ hate VWR.  BQ VWR.  But the word hate's in there, obviously.  Which is key to this story.  You'll, you'll understand in a second.  Then he writes whatever to another person.  And then, you're brilliant to Matt.  One, two, three, four, five.  So they're pointing out six of these tweets in the middle of the night.  And some saying, very suspicious.  It seems like you might have been drinking.  And then attacking some of his followers. 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  Um, he's claiming, and it's just embarrassing.  Oh, boy.  That he, his, his pocket tweeted those.  He pocket tweeted.  He was pocket tweeting.  Exactly.  Look at Jim Norton's eyes.  This is a former senator.  And I was talking to Ann about this.  These guys that don't understand, you know, the technology around them.  Yeah.  Like, obviously, you're in a spot.  People are thinking that you were drunk tweeting.  So they're going to ask you about it. 
[00:54:30]  Wouldn't you kind of, like, explore that option, if it's even possible?  Yes.  Especially with, and then it gets all fucking pissy about it with the reporter.  Yeah.  You can't pocket tweet different shit like that.  No.  It's impossible.  Pocket tweeting.  You can't pocket tweet one, two, three, four, like I said, yeah, six different tweets.  What, your pocket's deciding which one to tweet?  You can't even pocket tweet with an iPhone.  You know what this dumb cocksucker's saying that he's saying?  And he's probably thinking that because there's a Siri voice technology. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  So you were actually just saying, you were actually just saying, uh, hey, uh, whatever with  the hater thing.  You were saying that and it tweeted it, you fucking jizz bag.  Right.  I'll be right back.  This is.  I'm just going to get my own fucking shit.  This is crazy.  My nose is dripping.  Dripping.  You were out of tissues.  He's running to get.  I know that.  I understand that now, but if the guy said he wanted it here in the morning, why isn't  it here when they set the studio up? 
[00:55:30]  How fucking hard is that?  Yeah.  What's up with that?  You're on.  Are you to blame?  Sure.  Why not?  Well, whoever sets it up, he's asked for it before.  And I don't mean to be a big bitch about it.  I didn't know we ran out of tissues.  I apologize.  Okay.  Now everyone's in a bad mood.  I'm not in a bad mood, but it sounds like a small point, but it's like stupid ass nose is  dripping.  In his case, it's photography.  And what was the other one?  Surveying the land?  That's great.  So a Fox 25 reporter sat down with Brown because this is becoming a little bit of a thing. 
[00:56:00]  And he says, anyone ever hear of pocket tweet?  That's exactly how it's written.  Anyone ever hear of pocket tweet?  Pocket dial?  He asked the reporter.  I mean, it was pretty simple, you know.  I have an iPhone 5.  If anyone has an iPhone 5, the keys are small.  It's very, very sensitive.  And then he's trying to claim, you know, he rarely drinks and, you know, hasn't drank in a while. 
[00:56:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Last time I was ever drunk was at my bachelor party.  And that was, what, 28, 27 years ago?  So I guess no one has ever pocket dialed or pocket tweeted before he concluded.  He's just lying.  Yeah, you don't.  It's impossible.  You're brilliant, Matt.  Really?  You pocket tweeted that response?  They're just all a bunch of fucking liars.  They really are.  Whatever, Michael.  Whatever, bud.  Whatever.  I guess your pocket tweeted that?  And your pocket even knew to say whatever Michael to the Michael guy? 
[00:57:00]  Travis is marching in.  Travis.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hi.  Are you here about the Scott Brown story or the tissue situation?  No, tissue's all sex.  All right.  No, you're like, you're reading the story, but the audio that you've got in front of you.  Is it even better?  Well, yeah, because he explains it so, like, condescendingly.  Yeah, he's being a real dick about it.  Don't you know?  It's pocket tweeting. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  How about you figure out what, you know, what an iPhone can and can't do?  It takes out his iPhone, like, yeah, see?  Check this out.  You don't really get caught up in what people write about you or say about you.  You really don't.  How about that tweeting thing?  Anyone ever hear of a pocket tweet?  Pocket dial?  I mean, it was pretty simple, you know?  I have an iPhone 5.  Pocket dials?  Where is it?  If anyone has an iPhone...  And then he pulls it out of his pocket.  Oh, no.  Yeah, let me show you this thing that doesn't work.  Yeah.  He's basically saying, let me teach you a thing or two. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Let me prove my story is completely false.  Right.  If anyone has an iPhone 5, okay, the keys are small.  It's very, very sensitive.  Keys?  Yeah, Ayla was teaching me how to, obviously, get on Facebook and Twitter, and there's some  areas I didn't really understand.  So after her concert, we were here right in the living room and, you know, responded to  a couple of people and then put it in my pocket.  The next thing I wake up and I said, there's some...  Becomes a news story, Scott.  Trended worldwide. 
[00:58:30]  Worldwide trending on the pocket.  So you're saying that you just...  It was just a mistake.  What a liar.  He's lying.  Just lying through his teeth.  He's absolutely lying.  Well, these guys are so used to lying that I think they don't even know they're lying  anymore.  Wow.  And you usually don't like to say that because you don't want to accuse somebody of lying.  The bottom...  I pocket tweeted?  That's impossible.  I would love to know statistically what the odds of that are.  Zero.  It's technologically impossible to pocket tweet with an iPhone because the technology, the  iPhone screen is fingertip sensitive. 
[00:59:00]  Like, if you put your finger underneath your hoodie and you try to do something, it's not  going to work.  No, but you could say tweet and it will know which guy to go to and go whatever.  Yeah.  It won't pick up anything else.  Apparently.  If it was six tweets with whatever, then, you know.  But it's six different tweets.  He doesn't understand how it works.  No kidding.  That's what it is.  No.  So he's trying to be like, yeah, pocket tweeted.  You know, like pocket dial.  Because he's another pompous politician. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  It's the same thing with...  It just assumes he can just talk his way out of anything like they've done a million  fucking times before.  First of all, you have to hit the button.  Yeah, first you have to unlock the phone.  That just turns it on.  And if you have a lock on it, which I am sure he's a politician, you'd have to have  a lock on it.  So then you've got to put your code in.  Then you've got to open up your fucking tweet app.  Then you've got to go to compose or reply, actually.  So you've got to find the tweet and hit the thing to reply.  And then perfectly write whatever. 
[01:00:00]  And then write whatever.  This is all happening in your pocket, magically.  But nothing else you're saying is getting picked up.  So you're just sitting there and you're going, whatever.  Act.  So you think he was doing it all like voice command.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's what he's implying.  Unlock phone.  He's just insulting the reporter.  And we don't like these reporters in general.  He's insulting her intelligence and everyone else that has to fucking watch this.  It was just a mistake. 
[01:00:30]  Well, what else would it be?  What am I just randomly pressing numbers and trying it out there?  It just shows you, though, as a public figure.  And somebody is waiting for, especially because I was, you know, considering running.  So it was like, oh, you know, heading for him.  And now he's allegedly I'm drunk, drunk tweeting.  First of all, I rarely drink.  The last time I was ever drunk was my bachelor party.  That was, what, 28 years ago?  27 years ago.  I remember me and my friends got our dick sucked.  And he just totally implicates himself.  Pocket dialed or pocket tweeted before.  Can I tell you something?  Pocket tweeted. 
[01:01:00]  All he had to say was, yeah, I was annoyed.  And I was half asleep.  I was tired.  No, I wasn't drunk.  But I was just tired.  And I, you know, I looked.  I was irritated.  Right.  I'm a person.  Right.  And it would have went away.  Right.  This, in this, to me, in this explanation, his fucking political career.  Does anybody believe that?  No, no, but he's being so, like, just being all pompous and shit about it.  Yeah.  There's several articles online from, from different.  Oh, good.  I hope they don't let this one go.  Saying that, like, yeah, his explanation.  They're thinking it.  Yeah.  It sounds exactly like when Anthony Weiner was like, well, obviously my account was hacked. 
[01:01:30]  Well, that, that was the point I was, I was telling Ant today.  These guys are getting in trouble and they don't even know the basic fucking technology before  they start with their lies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do, do a little research so you can figure some of this shit out.  Like, why don't you ask one of your, like, assistants, like, hey, before I tell everybody  this complete bullshit.  Right.  Is it remotely possible at all?  Is this plausible?  Yeah.  Your truck was found wrapped around a telephone pole and nobody was in it or around it.  People are implying that maybe you were drunk, hit a pole and went home after, nah, my iPhone. 
[01:02:00]  It stalks my truck and I was pocket driving while I was asleep.  Right.  Doesn't that happen?  Can't you control your vehicle with the fucking, no, dummy.  And you can't pocket tweet neither.  No.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  In my case, for pocket tweeting.  They're just all hateable.  In my case.  Right.  They're so hateable.  Yeah.  Because they're all full of shit.  Full of shite.  Fucking shite.  But this is the type of guy, like, we also, we do train them to lie. 
[01:02:30]  Because we tell them that if you tell the truth, we will lynch you for it.  That's true.  So it's like, we, this is what we deserve.  This guy, this dog shit explanation, he's giving the public what we ask for.  Yeah.  And what we deserve.  Yes.  Because if he says, yeah, I had one too many, or maybe he wasn't, maybe he just, maybe  he was just cranky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this guy annoyed me.  Oh, well, well.  Oh, shouldn't be doing that.  Oh, yeah.  He's not fit to do anything.  So what we do is these, these fucking worms, like this guy. 
[01:03:00]  Cover up with a lie.  Cover up with a bad, condescending, terrible bullshit story.  I pocket tweeted.  I would, you know what?  If he was to sue me and say that I slandered him, I would say, I would almost be willing  to pay the fees just to get into court and say, could you demonstrate pocket tweeting,  sir?  Yeah.  If you can demonstrate pocket tweeting, I will pay any fucking fee. 
[01:03:30]  Demonstrate it for me.  Pocket tweeting.  It's a great story.  You cunt.  You know, maybe if you had a fucking Blackberry, an old school Blackberry with keys on it or  an old phone or something, it just isn't going to happen.  If he carried a spare hand in his pocket, it wouldn't be possible.  I'm sure the tech sites are going to have a lot of fun with this.  Yeah, because it's just anyone who knows anything about a smartphone knows that it's  not possible.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, I agree with this guy on Twitter.  This brown tweeting thing was a non-story until he lied. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, because now people are going to be like, all right, let's have some fun with this.  We didn't know about it.  No.  You know, nobody cared.  It was just a guy, you know, responding to some people on Twitter.  Big deal.  And he didn't even write anything that bad.  No.  He just said, whatever.  Why did he even delete them?  Why is that bad?  Whatever.  Nah, this one's going to have some legs.  It's not like mine.  They're not going to let this go.  You're going to call him an ass, cunt, fuckwad, dick.  But I mean, there's nothing terrible in here.  He wrote, you're brilliant, Matt. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Matt should be happy.  He used the wrong you're.  Yes, he did.  Oh, he did.  That's a big problem.  No, it's not you're.  It's you.  My brilliant wife.  I'm brilliant.  What about you?  You're.  It's.  The one that he should have said about was this BQ hate whatever.  Right.  That one he could have just said, oh, yeah, that was a mistake.  He says it in that piece where, look, you know, it's just. 
[01:05:00]  Randomly putting fucking.  Was he only claiming that one or all of them?  All of them.  Oh, OK.  Yeah.  Well, I think he obviously misspelled whatever.  Whatevs.  Yeah.  The one that starts with a B.  But he said in that piece that the one with the B that looks like whatever, but he's claiming  is a pocket tweet.  He's saying that one was a pocket tweet and then he just went to bed and then he woke  up the next morning.  So that would that would lead you to also believe that the proper spelling of whatever 
[01:05:30]  and the you're brilliant, Matt, with the wrong you're also pocket tweets.  Pocket tweets also while he was sleeping.  I don't know how that works.  This is like Toy Story when all the toys come to life.  Oh, I like Toy Story.  If it's only that one, I find that easier to believe.  You can't do it.  No, but I mean, if not a pocket tweet, but if it's just that one and he's saying that  was an accidental tweet, that one, I could believe one mistake.  Even though it's impossible.  No, I can't even believe that.  But I mean, come on. 
[01:06:00]  What is he thinking?  Oh, God.  No.  He should have gone with the Ambien tweeting.  I know people have done that.  Take a little Ambien and fucking woo-dee-doo-doo.  Use the wrong your.  Your.  Oh, boy.  It's a common mistake.  You should have used your.  I'm going to use your like days of your.  That's a good one.  How do you spell that one?  Y-O-R-E.  That's how I'm going to spell your.  To cover both of the yours.  Why don't we do that?  That's pretty smart. 
[01:06:30]  Smart.  I know.  I'm brilliant.  Why don't we do a little Black History?  Ooh.  More inventions in honor of Black History Month.  We got David Tell and Bob Kelly coming in today.  Maybe some others from the benefit.  Nice.  Pretty good.  We put out an open invite.  We'll see who shows up today.  When we get back, we got the Clive Davis at 81 coming out of the closet.  What?  You didn't hear about this.  No.  By the way, the tissues just got here.  There you go.  Now you're set. 
[01:07:00]  That took a while.  Tissue?  I don't even know you.  Ah, great one.  Great one.  Rockin' A.  Also play the diva shit that you found, D-Rock, right after this.  This year, to honor Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of the  great African-American inventors.  Today we honor James Robinson, inventor of the lunch pail.  Lunch break.  Here you go, honey.  Thanks, honey.  Mm-mm.  Looks delish.  What?  Yo, tell me you make your bitch bring you your lunch from your home. 
[01:07:30]  Of course I do.  What am I gonna do, leave it laying on the ground?  No, man.  Put your food in here.  It's a lunch pail, nigga.  Come on.  Genius, my man.  Genius.  But you know, if this was the shorty bringing me my food, maybe I wouldn't have invented  that shit.  My, you're charming.  You're the charming one, bitch.  You was charming my snake last night.  What?  The lunch pail.  Another African-American contribution to enrich our lives. 
[01:08:00]  For Black History Month, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we gonna have to break into, uh...  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know, um...  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages... 
[01:08:30]  Savages.  ...that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup, yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You wanna taste this?  Ooh!  Ooh!  Wow, that's really nice.  What, what, what?  Float against the wall.  I'm not, I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism. 
[01:09:00]  This is the OPNT Show.  On Sirius XM.  The date is October 11th, 1983.  It's 7.18pm.  Detective Club Soda with self-professed organized crime soldier, Lyle Chipperson.  Okay, Lyle.  You're requesting placement in witness protection.  What kind of information do you have for us?  Yo, I'm in the mafia.  Don't even fuck around with me. 
[01:09:30]  Don't get defensive.  Just explain your business here.  I was in the mafia for years.  My mob name was Lil Chippy D.  Okay, Lyle.  You have no record.  You've been seen with none of our organized crime contacts.  What was your role?  The hitman.  A hitman?  Mafia hitman.  Right.  The mafia.  Well, who do you work most closely with?  I ain't no rat.  Then I don't know why you're here.  Are you afraid of repercussions?  Yeah, good luck killing me.  I carry like fucking bazookas.  Lyle, there's no way you could have carried around a weapon like that. 
[01:10:00]  If you're just here to waste my time, I suggest you leave.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  I'd shoot and kill everybody.  Bury in a hole or something.  Then we'll see.  Mr. Chipperson, why are you here?  Fucking stupid cocksucker.  Start listening, you fucking piece of shit.  I can't believe you wasted our fucking time with this bullshit.  Do you know this is a crime?  Make him an offer that no one refuses.  Why don't you do yourself a favor, Lyle?  Walk out the door now. 
[01:10:30]  Fuck you.  You're a funny guy.  Laugh at this.  You like that?  How does this feel?  Fuck this.  What we have here is the best of both worlds.  The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer,  onboard memory,  and 30 years of human experience and interaction.  BoboCop, what are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust,  protect the innocent,  uphold the law, 
[01:11:00]  and to jerk off in a toilet, all right?  Part man,  part robot.  Complete imbecile.  Alive or dead?  Dead or alive?  You're...  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you, you metallic mongoloid.  Eat a bowl of dicks.  Will he be able to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember?  Bobo, it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You. 
[01:11:30]  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area.  Can I units, please respond.  We have a 16-3 in progress.  All right, let's go, Mr. Maloon again.  BoboCop, who is he?  What is he?  I suck.  The dumbest, most annoying person on the planet is now a law-enforcing cyborg.  BoboCop, BoboCop, any special message for the kids at home?  Believe me, all right, you gotta wear a condom when you go to sleep,  because you don't want to jizz in your pants when you're... 
[01:12:00]  BoboCop?  Sorry, sorry.  I mean, stay out of trouble.  BoboCop.  SiriusXM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, that's right.  It reminds me of the Beavis and Butthead movie. 
[01:12:30]  Every time I say it, and the fucking dance, that's hilarious.  Is that a good movie, still?  Fuck yeah.  Hilarious.  When Beavis doesn't know they're on, like, the airplane flies,  and they're taxiing, and he's like, oh, yeah, this is great. 
[01:13:00]  When are we gonna...  And they're like, ah!  It breaks out.  It's like hilarious.  Why are we playing this today?  You rock any reason or no?  No, just because it's fun.  Just because it's fun.  Nice.  Nice.  This is a little too new for our radio show, by the way. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  96?  This is a little too new for our radio show.  You know, on the way back from Atlantic City, big, huge billboard.  You read all those billboards on the way out?  Uh-huh.  And the one that got me was Chicago playing AC.  Hey, there you go.  I'm like, hey, we did Chicago Day of the Opie and Anthony show.  Maybe Sam wants to go.  I'd rather not.  I'm looking at the guys in the band.  I can't tell if they're new young guys or if they're the old guys with toupees. 
[01:14:00]  Because I guess I was driving too fast, so I only got a quick glimpse.  I'm like, wait, are they going with new guys with a couple of the old guys mixed in like these bands do?  Uh-huh.  Or are they just trying to all just stay young with the toupees?  Guaranteed.  I couldn't figure it out.  Guaranteed there's got to be new guys in there.  Come on now.  That's the thing to do.  Because Chicago, there was like fucking what?  Eight guys in Chicago?  And look, Sam found the first picture of Chicago.  That picture is very similar to what I just saw on the billboard.  Yeah.  Do they look like new guys or old guys with toupees? 
[01:14:30]  I can't figure it out.  Remember, the band's been around, it's got to be 40 years at least.  I'm going to say the guy in second row all the way to the right.  Second row all the way to the right.  New guy.  He's got to be a new guy.  But here's the other problem.  There are new guys that are now starting to look like old guys.  Old guys.  As well.  Because they put the new guys in the band so many years ago that the new guys are now looking like the old guys.  A second generation of old guys.  Yeah, second generation of old guys.  Because the two on the bottom row on the right, those are just old guys. 
[01:15:00]  Uh-huh.  The one you point out, new guy starting to look like old guy.  Uh-huh.  What about the guy next to him?  Is that a toupee or is that a old guy?  Can't tell, right?  Curly hair guy?  Yeah.  Can't tell.  Can't tell.  What about the guy in the back with way too much fucking hair?  Is he new guy that's now an older guy that has to go with the toupee?  I bet that one's a toupee.  Is Peter Cetera in that band still?  I don't really see anyone that looks like Peter Cetera. 
[01:15:30]  I don't see anyone that looks like anyone.  Except for the guy in the back.  He kind of looks like young Peter Cetera.  So maybe that's him with a horrendous fucking hair helmet.  So there you go.  There's my point.  I saw that on the way out.  Yeah.  Want to do Bad Company today?  What?  Bad Co., Bad Co., Bad Co.  By Bad Co.?  By Bad Co.?  That was always fun to say in rock radio.  Bad Co.  Here's Bad Co.  Off the album Bad Co.  Bad Co.  By Bad Co. 
[01:16:00]  Speaking of music, Clive Davis, he's a legend, right?  Yeah.  He was responsible for some of that Whitney Houston success.  Wasn't he?  Yeah.  Who's that guy?  That's Peter Cetera.  Wow.  What is that?  Holy fuck.  That is the worst hair job.  That's terrible.  That's horrendous.  That's a Frank Vincent wig.  That's a terrible hairdo.  Frank Vincent wig.  Look, do what you got to do, but you can't go over the top like that.  Yeah, that's bad.  He might have more hair than our own Sam Roberts.  No way. 
[01:16:30]  He's got a lot of hair.  I don't think it's real, but...  I don't think that's real.  I would bet money that's not real.  So, Clive Davis decided at the age of 81, it's time to tell the world that he's bisexual.  Come on out.  By the way, there's no such thing as bisexual.  Just stop it.  You're gay.  You're a gay man who sometimes might get some pussy, but you're a fucking gay man that sometimes  has some pussy.  A lot of people say there's no surprise here, but he's decided it's time. 
[01:17:00]  But let's see, pop up a picture.  The Amazing Randy did the same thing.  Yeah.  Same age, too.  He hit 80 and decided he had to tell the world he was gay.  I hope next year Tom Skerritt doesn't do that, because he's going to be 80.  He's going to be 80.  Tom Skerritt from Alien.  He was Dallas in Alien.  Who was?  Tom Skerritt.  Whatever happened to that guy?  He was also in the movie M.A.S.H.  Really?  Tom Skerritt was in the movie version of M.A.S.H., but his character never went translated 
[01:17:30]  to the TV version.  So he got rid of him.  Fascinating.  He was a southern racist.  Yeah, exactly.  Boy, E-Rock, you know that movie?  I love M.A.S.H.  You love M.A.S.H. the movie?  Potatoes.  Pretty depth to anything he steps on.  Oh, E-Rock comments.  Slobo.  Is that going to catch on?  I hope not.  Dude, Roland hasn't stopped saying it since you said it. 
[01:18:00]  Slobo?  Roland walks around this office just yelling.  Oh, fuck.  You hashtagged me on your elephant photo with it.  Oh!  What did he hashtag?  What was the word?  Well, I had a picture from the Ring of the Brothers, Barnum and Beverly Businesses.  Barnum and Beverly.  And it was all the elephants, and I just wrote, I apologize to E-Rock in advance.  Yeah.  And then I hashtagged it Slobo.  You're right, E-Rock.  I do feel bad, though.  No, you don't. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, I kind of do.  Don't feel bad for Slobo?  Yeah.  He didn't mean to do that.  It was a pocket tweet.  It was a pocket tweet.  Thank you, Jim Norton.  There's a story quickly that's on the thing about this TSA and this little girl that was  being, they wanted to pat her down.  She's in a wheelchair.  This poor little kid.  She's in a wheelchair.  I don't blame the TSA on this one.  That mother's a fucking cunt.  Wow.  She got her daughter all upset.  Wait, here's the audio.  It's done.  Oh, that's sad.  Brand new trip. 
[01:19:00]  We always miss it.  Every time you do that.  I'll buy the audio.  You've got the audio, too.  We got the audio.  We're doing that next.  Okay.  This is our entertainment break.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-do-do-do-do-do.  So what happened?  The, um, what the fuck story was that?  Yeah, the little girl.  Yes.  She was in a wheelchair rolling.  They were going to go to Disney World.  And they wanted to, like, check her wheelchair and pat her down.  She's in a wheelchair and they're taking her to Disney World.  Why?  When she should be punished. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Children in a wheelchair should be punished.  Go ahead.  I mean, obviously, they should not even be checking a tiny little girl in a wheelchair  with a family that's going to Disney.  But don't you think the next terrorist attack's going to come from something that we're not expecting?  Yes.  Perhaps, but, you know, you've got to do some profiling.  You've got to do some profiling.  And that doesn't fit the criteria. 
[01:20:00]  But the people you're profiling are fully aware that they're being profiled.  So wouldn't they do a workaround?  I'm not saying this would be the workaround.  A little girl in a wheelchair.  Raising a suburban family with a white girl in a wheelchair.  I don't know.  Probably not.  But they're going to look for a workaround.  So what is that?  So you've got to be kind of suspicious of everyone.  It's a pain in the ass, but.  No, you've got to go with probability.  You think?  And focus your efforts on some type of profiling that can weed out things that aren't a threat. 
[01:20:30]  This girl is not a threat.  Yeah, I agree.  But if I was a terrorist and I looked the part, of course I'm going to have to try to figure some shit out.  Right?  Maybe, but that's the shit that has to be looked into.  Next thing you know, you help the girl, her wheelchair is hanging out somewhere, and you stuff a couple things in there.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Just saying.  Well, whatever the case is, I was going to say anyway, I don't think the TSA is at fault for upsetting this girl.  I think the mother was trying to make something of this. 
[01:21:00]  Of course she was.  She was trying to make a big thing, a video of them fucking with the daughter and their family and whatnot.  Can we see the video?  And this poor kid is crying because she knows, she sees her mother is angry or something.  And they won't give her her little bunny stuffed toy and shit.  And this poor kid's screaming.  She goes, I don't want to go to Disney World.  Wait, so the bunny.  Yeah, it was very fucking painful to watch. 
[01:21:30]  It's a weird thing.  Like, I agree with you that obviously she's not a problem.  But I guess you've got to do a little bit of unpleasant searching because, again, the next one might come from Chechnians or people who are Muslim and look...  I understand.  It could come from white-looking people.  We never thought some idiot would fucking try to light their shoe on fire and it was going to be a bomb.  So you don't know where the next fucking thing's coming from.  If you profiled, that motherfucker should have been dragged in the back.  Yeah, I agree.  And fucking strip searched. 
[01:22:00]  But I think they're fully aware that we're profiling and they're going to try to figure it out.  The TSA kind of...  They so badly want to figure it out for the next one.  They're in a bad spot, too.  It's like, I know they're easy to hate.  Oh, they're so hateable.  Let's not forget that.  But we do demand safety and security.  And yet every time something happens...  Can you imagine on 9-11 if we had said, look, there won't be an attack.  Nothing will happen on a plane in this country for the next 10 years. 
[01:22:30]  And yet we're going to do nothing but complain about the security agency.  True, yeah.  Let's see what this is all about.  I don't know the story at all, Ant.  This cell phone video from February 9th shows Lucy Fork sobbing uncontrollably as TSA agents prepare to pat down the 4-year-old.  Lucy has spina bifida.  It was specifically because she was in a wheelchair.  You know, the statement was, well, she's in a wheelchair, so we have to do a pat down.  That's when Lucy's mom pulled out her cell phone and pressed record. 
[01:23:00]  Can I say something really fast?  Maybe they got some intelligence that they have a strong feeling that the next one's going to be done with some kind of wheelchair.  Maybe.  You're right.  I got no problem with it.  Because we don't know what they're fucking learning out there.  They're not telling us.  I think the mother's upsetting the kid more by making a big thing out of it.  She should have just told her, it's okay, they're going to come over and look at your chair or something like that.  She didn't do that.  No, she was, like, being argumentative with the TSA people, upsetting the daughter. 
[01:23:30]  It was fucking terrible.  Basically saying that I should get, even though I kind of agree with her, I know she's not the problem.  But she's basically saying.  She's making it worse.  Yes, I'm different than other citizens.  I should not have to go through this.  Treat my child like everybody else.  Don't treat my kid any different.  She's got to be searched.  Why?  She's different.  Yeah.  It's a tough spot to be in as a parent.  Yeah.  But I think I'm going to end on this one.  As a parent, you've got to realize, whoa, okay, my kid might get upset with this. 
[01:24:00]  Well, she should have fucking, you know, been...  Try to keep everyone calm and then deal with whatever issue you have after the fact.  Her number one priority should have been making sure her old fucking water balloon's spine wasn't crying.  Oh, wow.  You showed a heart for a second.  It was nice.  What?  What happened?  You actually showed a soul there, sir.  You said the video was tough to watch.  I know.  And then you referred to the person in the video.  Because he kept coming before it finished. 
[01:24:30]  He was uncomfortable with that feeling he had inside and had to push it right back down.  He was almost there for a second.  Was I?  Yes.  You felt bad for her.  Oh, God damn it.  Jeez.  Right.  Go with it, man.  I'm sorry.  You might surprise yourself.  I would.  Well, no, I was very...  It's very sad to see this poor girl.  She's very cute.  She's got a little bowl in her hair.  And she starts crying that she doesn't want to go to Disney World.  How do you think she would react if a big scary man called her water balloon spine?  She'd laugh. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's watch the rest of the video.  The intern responded that she was not going to be recorded.  That it was, in fact, illegal to record her.  But it's not illegal.  It's not.  Lucy's mom kept recording.  And eventually, the TSA agents decided not to pat down Lucy.  But the damage was already done.  The TSA released the following statement.  TSA regrets inaccurate guidance was provided to this family during screening and offers its apology.  We are committed to maintaining the security of the traveling public 
[01:25:30]  and strive to treat all passengers with dignity and respect.  I don't want to go to Disney World.  But the travelers at Lambert I showed the video to say Lucy wasn't treated with dignity.  Why are you showing them?  It makes me cry.  I have tears in my eyes.  I have grandbabies.  Give us a fuck.  They're not very grand.  They're stupid.  Lucy's father tells me he understood.  How is that news?  I don't know.  How is that news?  Here's what some fat lady thinks.  Who gives a fuck? 
[01:26:00]  I don't care what that cunt thinks.  Some fat lady thinks.  That's news?  Hey, here's the story.  Oh, by the way, here's more story.  Hey, fat pig, what do you think?  I don't have grandbabies.  Give us a fuck.  I hope your daughter throws him in the lake.  Shut the fuck up.  He's not part of the story, bitch.  And you know what?  It looks like they're just doing their jobs.  They're not being pricks, right?  They're annoying, and I do kind of hate them, but there's a way, if they were being obnoxious, 
[01:26:30]  but if they're being polite, that mother could have calmed that kid down in a second by just being nice.  I'm sorry to interrupt.  By the way, just because it was brought up on the show, a bunch of people tweeted me links to fucking wheelchair bomb stories.  It's happening.  It's happening, people.  No, I know.  It is happening, so.  And they didn't pat her down.  I don't know what the. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, I think they swabbed the chair for the explosive residue.  Yes.  You know, they'll swab the chair.  Give her a lollipop and send her on her way.  Which is fine.  And I understand that there could be wheelchair bomb.  Absolutely.  But I don't think it's going to be a little fucking kid like that and the family that's on its way to fucking Disney.  Yeah, but I don't think they would know in some weird way.  I know.  That's also possible, right?  I don't think they would be in on it.  That's the problem.  You just don't know.  Like, what if it was someone else? 
[01:27:30]  What if it was someone that worked with the family or had access to the family that said,  this kid goes, let's just say we knew that they didn't frisk little cripple kids.  Okay, this kid's going to go through that chair.  Yeah.  Yeah, they'll make the chair go through the metal detector, but they won't swab it.  So, again, the odds are against it.  Swab it! Swab it! Swab it!  That's from Waterworld.  I didn't see that.  Yes.  But it's a fair thing to do.  And the mother will, if you treat this kid differently, the mother will complain until it's convenient for the kid to be treated differently. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  Treat her the same as everyone else.  We have to search her.  Don't treat her the same as everyone else.  She's different.  She's in a wheelchair, for the love of God.  Yeah.  I think this kid should have been punished and sent home.  She's obviously a very bad kid.  She didn't want to go to Disney World.  She was crying that she didn't want to go to Disney World.  Make sure she wasn't saying, I want to go to Disney World.  No, she was saying, I don't want to, because you could hear it more, because she says it like five times.  She's a dumb kid.  Because her mother's kind of cunty.  Yeah.  Do we hear the mom at all?  In the original.  Ah, so Sam didn't get the right fucking. 
[01:28:30]  We have the original.  It's going to go right under it.  It's long, though.  Ready to go.  Look at them.  And the agent's saying, it's illegal to do that.  If we're taping and recording, it's not.  It's not illegal.  Can we get to the part where the mom acts up?  Or is that tough to do?  Or let's just play this?  Or what do you want to do?  Or just whatever.  My phone's going to run out of room.  It's illegal to do that.  You can't touch my daughter unless I can record it. 
[01:29:00]  Well, you understand what I mean.  We've had a lot of people that we're not having.  We're not having a sister.  I'm asking she's one of the worst.  But it is against the law.  And the other sister's trying to help our little kid sister.  So sad.  Sorry.  Okay.  See, can I come over real quick?  Oh, my God.  It's okay, baby.  By the way, can you pause real quick?  What do you mean you can't touch my child without my consent?  Well, then you can turn around and get the fuck out of the line.  Well, that's pretty much the... 
[01:29:30]  They can touch your child without your consent.  If you want your child on that plane, they can't finger the kid.  But they do have the right to pat her down.  Sorry.  Because if that's the rule, if that's the...  You don't touch my kid.  Well, that's pretty easy to sneak a bomb on.  You could sew it into a baby.  Oh, what she got here on her back.  Right.  You know, we don't know.  And I just changed my whole opinion on this whole fucking story.  Did you?  You spun it right around.  Yes, I did.  What happened?  Because someone is reminding me of the Kim K story. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, Kim Kardashian.  Kim Kardashian.  They just let her and Kanye just walk through everything.  Exactly.  So now I'm with, you know, now I'm kind of leaning toward a dance point on this whole thing.  If the terrorists can get a senator, they can get...  But, I mean, my point is, you don't know where it's coming from.  I mean, maybe the Kim K, Kanye angle would be great for a terrorist, and they do it in  such a way they don't even know.  In her tits.  Her big, fat fucking ass.  Her ass.  That I think is amazing.  Fucking ass bomb. 
[01:30:30]  That ass is big, right, Sam?  You saw it up close.  Yeah, I like it, though.  Well, you're black, though.  Black guys like bigger asses.  And he dated black chicks exclusively.  Yes, he did.  Quite a while.  Did you really like it?  Was it too big?  No, I like it.  It's very big.  It's very big.  It's almost cartoonish, but...  That's so stupid.  Like an X-rated cartoon.  Who wants that?  I don't know.  There are guys that love that.  You want something going on, but you don't want it to look cartoonish.  I kind of like the cartoonish. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Yep.  Does it smell differently?  That I don't know.  I would doubt it.  She'd probably work hard to keep it clean.  How does your lovely wife put up with that shit?  You saying you like a cartoonish ass.  Oh, my God.  Well, she knows.  Jeez.  Do you know what I'd say if I stumbled onto the scene with the little girl?  What would you say?  If I was the supervisor?  All right, what's the hullabaloo?  Would your hands do that?  Yeah.  Like the skipper from... 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, so your hands would go off and you'd wiggle your fingers close to your chest.  That's all the hullabaloo.  Hey, what's the hullabaloo?  Everyone laughs.  Diffuses the situation.  No, except for the kids.  She keeps crying.  Then we all point and chant, shut up in a circle.  I'm a kid bully.  Poor kid.  You want to play more?  Or have we done it?  I guess we did it.  You know, the mother's an asshole.  Yeah, she is.  And you can see on the video, she, I guess in editing, put some text on it as to what was going on and what she was thinking and what the TSA was doing at the time. 
[01:32:00]  And it really seems like she's being very picky with little things that don't really matter.  I don't hear the mom being an asshole yet, to be honest with you.  I hear a mom protecting her daughter.  Yeah.  Does it get worse?  It gets worse.  And the text that you read kind of sees what her frame of mind was at the time.  And she's just being an asshole.  But you know what's funny?  It's like, this is what the media covers.  Man, you search a little white kid going through TSA to Disney World. 
[01:32:30]  And people are outraged.  They can't believe it.  White people are very important, Jimmy.  But that really is.  This is the same fucking press that will crucify Alec Baldwin for saying coon or thinking that he said coon.  Yes.  This is the same fucking people.  Now they're outraged.  The little white girl is.  Outraged.  Outraged.  We got this video.  Oh, blueberries are in.  God, I love blueberries.  Yeah, I do too.  You got a lot there.  Oh, I was buying them the other night. 
[01:33:00]  You got a lot there, don't you?  That's so creepy.  You got a lot there.  You really got a lot there, don't you?  Yeah, I love some blueberries.  He's eyeing your blueberries.  I was in the store.  Maybe just a handful would be nice and refreshing.  You can have a handful.  Yeah.  But I was, you know what was running through my head when I was in the store getting blueberries?  I couldn't stop saying it.  What?  Do you want some blueberries?  I kept saying it to myself in a British accent.  I don't know why I was saying that.  I was literally overtired. 
[01:33:30]  I had a tin of blueberries.  I kept going, would you like some blueberries?  Would you like some blueberries?  Would you like some blueberries?  It's fun to say.  Would you like some blueberries?  Would you like some blueberries?  Would you like some blueberries?  Does that guy have a name?  No.  The English guy.  It has no, there's no context to it.  Blueberry limey.  It just, yeah, it just felt, yeah, Niles, in quotes, the blueberry.  Niles, the blueberry.  Do you like some blueberries?  Do you like?  It's hard not to say it. 
[01:34:00]  Would you like some blueberries?  That is fun to say.  It is.  It rolls right off.  Well, I would like some blueberries.  That's for sure.  Hey, we got Clive Davis and, uh, are we done with this yet, you think?  We do it?  Yeah, I think we covered it.  All right.  Certainly.  Um, we got the Bieber shit, too.  Bieber.  The Bieber shit's good.  But first, Clive Davis, because we, uh, started this break, I guess, with this.  81, coming out of the closet.  Ever the showman, Davis leaves the personal secret he's kept for the past 30 years for the  last chapter of his book. 
[01:34:30]  You were married twice, divorced twice.  Correct.  What you had never publicly talked about was the fact that you'd had a relationship with  a man and then several men.  It's not, as I write, that the heavens opened up.  John Cheever?  But I realized, in my case, the most important thing, I'm relationship-oriented, and I would  open up my perspective, my life, my emotion, to have a relationship with a man as well as  a woman.  And so that, when it comes to the pure subject of sex, when our marriage was over, I did go 
[01:35:00]  through a period of having sex with two different women and with a male.  And so, for me, this very maligned, misunderstood subject of bisexuality came up.  It's been said that people are either gay, straight, or lying.  Correct.  I'm not lying. 
[01:35:30]  I'm not lying.  It exists.  For over 50 years, I never had sex with a male.  It wasn't repressed.  I had very good sexual relationships with women.  And had you thought about men in that way?  Never.  Never.  Clive, tell me, did you feel shame when you first started having sex with a male?  Their fucking tone is enraging.  I never felt shame.  No.  I never felt shame.  I felt puzzled the subject of bisexuality really needs much more discussion, because the answer 
[01:36:00]  is it's a status that does exist.  Dear Clive, last night with you was bliss.  I fear my orgasm has left me a cripple.  Seinfeld.  Cheever letters.  That one's hilarious.  My letters!  Yeah.  No?  The letters, the cabin burns down, because Kramer has a cigar burning in there, and it 
[01:36:30]  burns the cabin down, and all that's left is a little strong box.  Yeah.  They bring it back to Susan's parents' house, and Susan's father is like, where are my letters?  And it was from John Cheever's, and he was having gay sex with him.  Travis is in hysterics somewhere right now.  Oh, it's great.  You know he's laughing his ass off.  Of course he is.  Look, he runs out of the office and puts his thumbs up.  I would have.  These guys love talking Seinfeld around here. 
[01:37:00]  I would have started asking Clive, so what'd you do?  Were you kissing a bunch of peckers or something?  Oh, wow.  Why would you say that?  Imagine how he'd react to that question.  You're kissing a bunch of peckers or something.  Peckers.  Chip.  Jesus.  That's fucking great.  Oh, Chip is fucking horrible.  Yeah, so what? 
[01:37:30]  Were you kissing a bunch of peckers or something?  Or what?  Or something?  Oh, Tippi.  D.  That still bother you?  Yeah.  It should.  It's just, you know, I just think that the show is starting to...  No, it should bother you.  Yeah.  I wasn't...  Yeah.  I'm kind of theedy.  Fucking assholes.  Yep.  David Tell and Bob Kelly are going to join the show next.  I want to hear that Bieber audio.  Yes.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  We'll do it next?  Okay, I just don't want to forget, because that's good stuff.  It really is. 
[01:38:00]  I know, it's Bieber, but trust me.  Yeah, I mean, there's phone calls that have been released.  There was a castration plot.  All right.  Nice.  And we'll discuss it after these messages.  The O.P. and Anthony Channel.  He's so horny.  Series XM.  Are you tired of singles bars?  Are you looking for a sure thing?  You're cruising the urinals, and there's someone beside you that you think is hot. 
[01:38:30]  You might just give him a glance and see if he can strike eye contact.  In his seminar, Anthony will instruct you how to find the best places to go.  A good way to find out whether a restroom is cruisy.  Look for graffiti on the stall walls.  He'll even give you insider tips on how to find that special partner.  If there's someone beside you, try tapping your foot once. 
[01:39:00]  It's man-on-man gay bathroom sex with Anthony Cumia.  Now he moves his foot over and touches the other guy's foot.  When this touch is made and then no one moves away, I would like some gay bathroom sex.  What? You're not a tapper?  Anthony Cumia has other methods of making yourself known.  Clearing your throat can also be a good way of letting others know.  Anthony Cumia's seminar for man-on-man bathroom sex.  You gotta jiggle the bait around, or else the fish ain't gonna bite. 
[01:39:30]  Now in a rest stop near you.  I can just see the fun that's gonna happen in the bathrooms here today.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, sounds good.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Me, me, me.  Bob Kelly started the evening last night. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, I guess we're doing Bad Company Day.  And baby, I want you.  What's the matter? Your mic stinks?  Now tell me...  What?  Why?  What's wrong?  Did you forget to push my mic on?  Oh, there you go.  You got some.  No, you're on.  What's wrong?  This?  It's flopping down.  You gotta just, you gotta tighten it.  Yeah, you gotta tighten your mic.  You gotta loosen that, and then put it up higher than his mouth.  And then let it drop down.  And then it'll drop down. 
[01:40:30]  Tighten it.  Now tighten it.  Go tighten it.  Oh my god.  Oh, you can't do it that way.  There you go.  Now, Titan.  Titan.  Get off me, Edgar.  I want to get him little mittens.  I know, right?  Those baby mittens so they don't scratch their eyes.  Yeah, just a cover for his stupid hands.  Bobby kicked off the Patrice O'Neal benefit last night, fucking killing it.  Setting the pace for everybody, everyone else.  It was a monster show.  It really was. 
[01:41:00]  It reminded me of the virus shows without all the hurrah.  And the alcoholism.  And the meat.  I tried to bring that.  I tried to bring that part of it.  Somebody said backstage that was the first time you guys all did it since the virus, really.  Yeah, it's the first time we've all been together since then, yeah.  And it was kind of sad at one point.  I was like, because I remember those shows.  And I remember me and Patrice always had the same locker room.  You guys always put us together.  Oh, yeah?  For some reason.  And, you know, yapping to him. 
[01:41:30]  And then Voss, I'm anxious.  I think it's going to be good.  Yeah.  I didn't take my anxiety medicine.  It was funny last night, Rich.  Eight o'clock.  But he kept saying how he was suffering from anxiety.  And then he's telling me and Ant to give him a really nice intro.  You know?  And then he proceeds to trash us.  I'm like, really?  Because it's Voss.  I know, but he wanted desperately the real nice intro.  Oh, you gave him the line?  I gave him the line.  What was it?  The lesbian and the...  The lesbo and the doomsday prepper. 
[01:42:00]  That was pretty goddamn lying.  It is funny.  Why would you give that to Voss, you bastard?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  It was a great night, though.  You guys coming out.  Oh, we're fucking amazing.  And everything went flawless.  Everybody kind of stuck to their time.  And the only thing sucked about going up front is that they were really on me.  Hey, fucking, you know, do your time.  And I was panicking.  I was panicking.  I was just watching the...  Like, fucking...  Because what happens is when you get your time, it switches, turns red. 
[01:42:30]  We were talking about this.  We were talking about that.  That's the...  I have been an asshole for two and a half minutes.  Yeah, it's just red and it's going, one, dickhead.  Two, fuck off.  Three, get off, you piece of shit.  Five, Patrice is dead and you're fucking his memory.  Three, but...  It was great.  Yeah, it was a great night.  And everybody killed, too.  It always sucks when someone...  No one had a bad set.  No one person had a bad set.  I really was hoping Keith Robinson would take a hot one just to teach him a lesson. 
[01:43:00]  Damn it.  God damn it.  He killed it.  He did.  I haven't seen Ian Edwards in so long.  He was really funny.  And then, you know, I've seen Bill and Bobby a million times.  But Ian, I don't see him anymore because he lives out in L.A.  And we used to work together all the time at the Boston Comedy Club.  He used to have dreads.  He's bald now.  Oh, did you know Ian before?  Yeah, I know him from back in the day.  One of the best Pete Correale stories ever with Ian Edwards.  Yeah?  What?  He was on stage talking about his dowry.  Like, you know, African couples have a dowry.  And they were like, yeah, you have to give them cattle. 
[01:43:30]  And Pete Correale went, cattle?  It just came out and he heard him, but he thought it was an audience member at the old Boston.  And he went, yeah, motherfucker.  What do you think they used before they had money?  And Pete went, you.  That's fucking good.  Yeah, it was a great show, man.  Everybody killed it.  It was.  What's up with the posters that everyone's talking about?  Oh, yeah, they sold great, first of all. 
[01:44:00]  Can you guys print more or no?  No, you print, huh?  Limited run because it's a work of art.  It's not just a poster.  We went to Staples or Kinko's and had them.  We had the artist, Tyler Stout, donated the image.  He made the image.  He's a fan of Patrice.  He came up with two versions.  And then they, you know, they hand silk screen each one.  And then he signs them and he numbers them.  So there's only 300 of the purple.  There was 100 of the gold.  We sold a lot of the gold.  We sold a lot of them last night.  But we also signed five each. 
[01:44:30]  So there's five gold, five purple that are going to be coming out this week on an auction  that are signed by everybody who did the show.  And then the rest of them are going online on the same page.  So at Danny J. Ross and me and Billy and Norton, you guys will be tweeting out when they go online.  Dot com.  The website.  All that dot com.  Dot com.  W-W-W.  No, what was it?  Danny J. Ross dot com.  Can you turn that down?  Danny J.  What is it?  Danny J. Ross.  At Danny J. Ross.  Okay.  What is it? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, you were doing it as a website, I thought.  Now I'm confused.  What's going on, Sam?  Just go to patriceoneal.  Dot big cartel dot com.  Yeah.  Oh, where the fuck did Big Cartel come from?  All right, we'll put that on the Facebook page.  Right.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook will have the same phone.  Right now it says they're sold out, but I think that just because Danny hasn't counted  how many are left yet.  We have some purple and some gold left, and then the five and five signed by all of us,  so they'll be coming out.  So get them.  We autographed them.  Oh, I see.  A fucking Voss last night.  I'm like, everybody walks in.  I go, just don't sign on the art and make it small. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, boy.  Boom, boom, boom.  He comes in, first one, right over the fucking image.  No.  Right on the rocket.  I'm like, I said don't sign on the fucking art.  What a dope.  On the rocket?  Yeah, right on the edge of the rocket.  At least it wasn't on Patrice.  I had to fucking like yell at him every signature just to make him shake so he'd sign it correctly.  What a dope.  So that one's worth more money now.  Voss's name on the rocket.  Because it's the exact opposite of what he's on in show business. 
[01:46:00]  He's signing an anchor.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, those images were really fucking well made, man.  I liked them a lot.  Real artwork.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yes, indeedy.  I don't want us to get off track with this Justin Bieber thing.  Yeah.  I definitely want to hear what the fuck this is.  Yeah, sure.  You want to do that?  I definitely, yes.  This is some.  Jimmy will just reach over and touch Bobby's hand.  I tried to grab Jonathan's mule last night.  How big was it? 
[01:46:30]  Big one.  I don't know.  He told me.  It looked big.  It's rambunctious.  It's massive.  Why?  I got a picture.  I just retweeted Vaughn because she said I gave her the biggest laugh of the night last night.  But it wasn't during the show.  We were taking the picture after.  Jonathan was snapping the picture.  And I go, look at Jonathan's bulge.  And she couldn't stop giggling and looking at it.  You can't stop looking at it.  Was it extra huge last night?  It's just obscene.  Because he wears pants to show it off or something.  It's obscene.  Yeah, it looks like a donkey dick.  Yeah.  He's just. 
[01:47:00]  He gets embarrassed.  I went to grab it.  But he didn't like.  He pulled away, but not totally.  Yeah.  He can't pull.  He pulls it back a little bit.  He pulls it back, but it takes an extra two seconds for his bulge to come back.  Is it just big balls or.  I think he's just got a big penis and big balls.  Just everything.  But Florentine's obsessed with it, too.  It's all we talk about.  Really?  He has an awkward helmet.  It's like a big helmet.  Yeah.  And the shaft and the helmet are the same.  Like, usually the helmet's bigger.  Yeah.  It looks like it's the same.  But it, like, hangs at, like, five inches. 
[01:47:30]  Which is, like, most dicks.  Do you know what I mean?  And he gets all embarrassed.  That's the best part.  And he tries to cover up.  Yeah.  He hates when we talk about balls.  No, he really does.  I think he has custom underwear.  With, like, a sock.  A pocket.  Yeah, like a dick sock that he has to slip his mule in.  He should just show us and just get it out of the way.  The gayest fucking Joe ever.  I love it.  But he's not.  He just should, though.  Fuck.  Yeah, hold that cock out for Pete's sake. 
[01:48:00]  Justin Bieber.  So, I don't know this story fully there, Sam Roberts.  There was a plan to castrate Justin Bieber.  Some guy in prison hired someone to do it.  Yeah.  Wow.  And choke him to death.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  People in prison love Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, he's close to a woman.  They haven't seen a woman in a long time.  And they get these weird...  Why don't they get...  If you're going to fantasize about someone, fantasize about a woman, you're fantasizing  in prison, and he looks like a woman, and why not just a woman? 
[01:48:30]  He does look like a woman, though.  Because if you're fucking dudes, and you have to have that open, and then this guy looks  like a cute little girl...  Right.  Then you can kind of, like, live in that world.  Is this considered bringing the gay back to the show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're not doing gay anymore.  Yeah.  We're done.  We've turned the corner.  Finally.  Yeah.  No more gay stuff.  No more gay shit.  Yeah.  We've turned the corner.  That's right.  We're almost a weekend.  We went uber gay.  We're going to meetings and everything, man.  You go to be queers and all this.  We fucking do this.  Believe me, we fucking hit bottom the last week. 
[01:49:00]  I was taking a piss today, and I looked over, and the guy's helmet...  No, we were all deeply affected.  Yeah.  I saw the fucking photos on Twitter.  It was hitting bottom.  We are convinced.  We were convinced that those guys were taking a dick in the ass for $1,500.  $1,500.  We weren't allowed to...  Like, for once, the company did the right thing, because there's no insertion or any  of that shit.  These guys would have absolutely blown each other, and at least one would have taken  a dick in the ass.  I'd be there a couple...  For $1,500. 
[01:49:30]  There were probably a couple behind closed doors.  This was nothing to them.  No.  This was Saturday night.  No, that was the problem.  You could see it in their eyes.  They were men.  You could see it in their eyes.  There was a desperation in the air.  I didn't realize the economy was that bad.  There was one guy that was willing to do anything, because he needed the money.  Anything.  And then his wife broke down after the show, badly.  Cried?  Cried.  Yeah, we were trying to console her.  A lot of us had to console her.  We're trying.  Weeping uncontrollably.  I was like, look, it was fun.  It was just for the show.  It was all just goofy stuff. 
[01:50:00]  And we all saw what was going on, and there was nothing goofy about it.  It was like, what the fuck's going on in here?  Are you guys talking about Sal and...  You talking about the contest you had with listeners?  We brought in listeners.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm talking about the ass-waxing.  That was nothing.  That was nothing.  Dude, we had guys in here making out with each other.  What?  Exactly.  You don't know about the contest?  No.  I knew about...  I saw photos of Sal lying on the table with his ass out. 
[01:50:30]  That was the week before.  So the gay thing got completely out of control.  And it ended with the one-and-done gay off.  And the guys, you know, we would just come up with scenarios.  Troy Kwan.  And Troy's like, how about you guys just make out?  So two freaking listeners are making out with each other.  At one point, there was two guys making out in front of...  Their wives.  ...a gay guy in the chair.  And their wives.  And lotion in their hands.  They're all completely naked. 
[01:51:00]  Jerking off the gay guy in the chair.  While the other guy's massaging his balls.  And they were mouth kissing.  And they're fucking kissing.  Do you understand what we're trying to tell you here?  Do we have any video of that?  We have to have some footage of that.  It was horrific.  Listen to me, man.  Can you show Bob some?  That's what we're saying.  We realized it became a problem.  We're done.  Are you saying that there was two regular guys listening?  Regular.  What did you hear?  And they would jerk.  Yes.  Wait, do we have any on the line or is it only on the camera still?  I don't need it to see the camera. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, no.  We've got to see some of that.  It's probably just on the camera.  But it didn't go online.  And they let you video?  Dude.  See, now you're in.  I thought you knew a little bit about this.  This is how bad it was.  And there was no one.  You weren't allowed to blow anyone or take a dick in the ass.  But these guys would have done it.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  They would have absolutely.  Because toward the end.  Maybe not all of them, but at least one.  Toward the end, also, they were kneeling down, kissing.  While the gay guy. 
[01:52:00]  You made them kneel and kiss?  Yes.  They were kneeling down because they had to kneel in front of the gay guy.  Because the gay guy was then smacking their faces with his penis as they made out.  Where were you guys?  Right here in utter fucking despair and disgust.  We barely talked, me and aunt.  Did Jimmy come in with sweatpants on?  It was so bad.  And our gay performer, it's GoGoHarder on Twitter.  He came in an hour and a half late.  He was actually really fucking funny.  This is, I can't.  Oh, it's not.  It's fucking.  Is that Jim? 
[01:52:30]  Where?  Who is it?  Sam Sherman, Bobby.  Are they sucking toes?  Yeah.  Off the camera.  Yeah, they're just.  Get off me.  I'm fucking watching.  Don't touch me while you want.  Two guys sucking the gangster's toes.  He's touching Bob's leg while they're watching this together right now.  Boy, do they walk.  Get off me, man.  I don't need the money.  Bobby's getting very uncomfortable.  Get off me.  Jimmy won't leave him alone.  What?  They're sucking.  Right?  Yes.  Bob, come on, right?  When did they move up?  Oh, they did it for a minute. 
[01:53:00]  And this guy's naked?  Well, he's a stripper.  Everyone's naked.  They're all naked.  They're all naked.  The contestants are all naked.  Just a fucking hairy leg.  Yes.  And dude, their wives were all there watching in horror.  Their wives could have tapped out before that.  Did you kiss him up the thigh, Bob?  Look.  Did you give everybody money?  No.  No.  Dude, the wives could have tapped out at any time also.  But the one guy told his wife, don't you tap.  We need the money.  They're kissing the thighs.  She started crying.  Oh, Jesus.  The gay guy. 
[01:53:30]  Jesus.  Look at that.  He's holding the head.  Look, it gets worse, though.  What did the guy say?  Don't hold my head?  No.  But wait.  Look.  Didn't we have them?  What happens?  Where was the kissing?  That's the worst part.  That was so bad.  Did you?  Oh, God.  This makes me.  $1,500.  I hear there's so many.  I'm angry.  I'm sad.  That's how we felt.  I'm fucking disgusted.  We were all fucked up.  That's gay.  Get off me, Jimmy.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  I'm trying to see.  I want to see. 
[01:54:00]  Bobby, we were unbridled gay sex.  This guy's so embarrassed, his elbow is fucking blushing.  Yeah.  It was disturbing, Bobby.  What's the cream?  When did they kiss?  You got to show Bobby kissing.  They're putting oil on their hands.  They're not going to jerk this guy.  They're putting oil on their hands.  Because that means they're getting ready to jerk the guy off.  To jack him off.  Come in and tell.  Hey, Dave and tell.  Oh, God.  Please show Dave this.  Did someone take a cast of action?  No, they just ran out of fucking bits on the O&A show.  Yes, we did.  We had their creativity died. 
[01:54:30]  And they went.  This is called jumping the shark, Dave.  This is one of their contests.  It's called the gay off.  Their wives are in the room watching while they're doing this.  Is this why it's on the world's oldest camera?  Is that a camera?  Oh, nice.  Are they kissing yet?  Do you have to see the kissing?  Oh, yeah.  Show Bob the kissing, Sam.  I love gay porn.  You don't like it?  Oh, God.  Where's the kissing?  They're not kissing.  Settle down.  Bob, they should be kissing.  Settle down.  He's touching Bob's leg. 
[01:55:00]  Bob is so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Those are regular guy listeners that came in.  For $1,500.  They literally had a gay experience with other men.  Who's in front of their wives?  In front of their wives.  Right here.  Wow.  Probably in the seat you're sitting in, Dave.  The hot Asian?  Yes.  The Asian is one of their wives?  Where's my Bible?  Hot Asian.  What?  I've done that.  You know, there's one thing about watching gay porn, but having a younger boy show it to you.  It's a new level. 
[01:55:30]  It really is.  A little kink.  A little twink that he is.  But our point, Bobby, we're done with the gay.  We're seven days in, I think.  Six or seven days in.  Good for you.  We've had it.  We realize we have a lot of this shit.  The things I cannot change.  The courage to change the things I can.  You fucking homos.  And the wisdom to know the difference.  Yes.  Wow.  I think that's very narrow-minded.  Get off.  Try to rub your arm.  Let's everybody shut off.  Can I get another taste?  Bobby's really getting a little...  Is he sucking his...  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  No, he's not.  That is just...  There's no coming home from that.  No, that's what he's doing.  We said we destroyed their marriages.  Yeah, dude.  She's going to see him...  What's he doing?  That's like seeing your girl swinging.  Let's try it.  Oh, he's rubbing it on his face.  Look.  Are they mad by Christian Mingle?  I don't care.  I kind of like the bit now.  It's gay.  It's fucking...  Dude, it was a great bit.  That is gay sex.  I'd rather see two girls one cup than this.  Of course.  I know.  It's fucking sick.  It really isn't good. 
[01:56:30]  And is this on the...  You didn't put this anywhere.  No.  You can't...  You're never going to, right?  Why?  The cock on the face.  I want copies of that.  Because the fucking kid someday...  Yeah.  He's going to go on...  I mean, he did a fucking gag for you assfaces.  Stuff doesn't stay.  The internet's a fad.  No, it's not.  Stuff doesn't stay there forever.  I just watched a fucking...  A rape porn that I watched around 20 years ago.  I watched two days ago.  It was you in the audience.  It started out as fun. 
[01:57:00]  Then it became real and very disturbing.  Yeah, it wasn't a soft cock in the room.  Well, Jesus.  See, if you would Instagram that, it would look like it was their parents doing it.  It would be a better way to go.  Yes.  Go with the Kelvin filter.  At least you got a nice looking guy, though.  Oh, they were awful.  No, the gay guy.  At least you didn't get one of them to fucking...  Oh, the gay guy?  He was really...  He didn't care, though.  Jimmy said he got nice cheeks.  So these guys are married?  Yeah.  They're married to women.  Yes.  They're in the room.  They're in the room as this was happening. 
[01:57:30]  And what were the wives doing?  Cheering them on?  One was crying.  Because there was a $1,500 prize for whoever could be the gayest straight guy.  Is this 1902?  I know.  The girls, the wives, or the guys could have tapped out at any moment.  Wow.  One of the wives was told by the husband before they even came in,  you don't tap no matter what.  We need the money.  Wow.  And that girl was horrifically bawling and crying.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, they started kissing. 
[01:58:00]  That's what we try to tell you.  A while ago.  In front of a swinging dick.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I see.  I see.  I see.  Isn't that disturbing, Bob?  Oh, they're fucking closing their eyes.  Bobby, one of the...  Get off me.  Hold on.  One of the kissers...  They're closing their eyes.  Hold on.  One of the kissers, we learned, has MS and desperately needed the money for his medication.  Did he win?  It got so fucking sad in here.  Don't close...  Keep your eyes open.  It's less gay.  Like a flounder? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, like this.  Bobby, look.  Look.  That is so...  And they're talking.  Better than close your eyes, you're thinking of that $1,500.  Yeah.  Money, money, money, money.  Money, money.  How do you fucking kiss like that?  No!  I know.  You mean that in a complimentary way?  How do you kiss like that?  I'm asking a question.  How do you do it?  The guy with MS...  Please don't be the guy with MS1.  No, but we got more money.  We got...  We got to do his Twitter.  We gave them both.  He was real...  He was... 
[01:59:00]  Let's just put it this way, Bobby.  He lost.  He was so mad.  He's like, look, I didn't stop.  I would keep going.  I'll do more.  We wanted to stop the contest because it was deeply disturbing.  He would have been the guy that got fucked in the ass.  He would have let the gay guy fuck him in the ass.  Because he needed the money that badly.  For $1,500.  So Steven Singer did the right thing and got more money.  More money for him.  Good for him.  So thank you to IHateStevenSinger.com.  That was so bad.  What is that?  What's he doing?  What now?  What's he doing?  What is he doing?  Who's that guy? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, he's the last one.  He was kissing their neck.  This guy.  You can tell he's not gay.  And they didn't know each other?  No.  No.  Wow.  Just came in.  Chemistry.  You know what we were trying to do?  Right off the bat.  We were trying to get them to do like a four-way armpit lick.  Like a man armpit lick.  No, you were trying, Jimmy.  That would have been great.  Jimmy was trying.  Jimmy had his own perversions that he was thrown in there.  Jimmy was trying to save 500 bucks.  No, you were.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Whoa.  Good fun.  I'm like half angry. 
[02:00:00]  All right, turn off the old camera.  All right, dude.  Get this out of my face.  It's David Tell.  How are you, sir?  Good, man.  How's it going, guys?  Good seeing you last night.  Yes.  The big, amazing benefit.  That was great.  It's very cool.  You know, I've done a lot of these, and I have to tell you, that was the biggest, best produced,  just all-around great benefit I've ever seen.  It really was.  To all the fans of Patrice and, of course, all the comics, that was just an amazing turnout.  Everyone did very well.  There wasn't one bomb.  Nope.  I was a little sappy, but I thought it was all pretty straight up. 
[02:00:30]  And it was a long show, too.  It didn't feel like a long show.  Except for Will's poem.  Black star, black star.  I want a t-shirt.  Black star, black star, black star.  Black star, black star, black star.  Black star, where are you?  Black star?  The best part was when his iPhone turned off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was Patrice trying to tell him something.  Did you see that?  I was upstairs.  It fucks up the whole pacing.  If you're going to do a poem, you can't have your iPhone turn off in the middle of it  and go to the audience, wait, I've got to turn my phone back on or reset it or whatever  the fuck he said. 
[02:01:00]  He didn't write it down.  He didn't write black star down.  I want to hear the poem again.  Black star, black star.  Oh, God.  I was walking.  I wasn't even in the show.  I was upstairs, and I just walked by a speaker and heard black star, black star.  I was like, what?  Stop me in the tracks.  What?  Yeah.  What the fuck is he doing?  Well, at the end of his set, and he had a great set, too,  he decided he needed to read something for Patrice that he wrote.  Shout out.  A little shout out.  Was Patrice the black star?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  We got that much.  Because it got a little confusing there.  Now, I wonder if we could get Will in to do that as those two guys go down on each other.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  If we would have had a tsunami of awkward.  And gotten rid of all the gay.  Mm-mm.  You know.  Let's get Will on the phone and do black star.  Go ahead.  Black star, black star.  Oh, God.  Maybe not.  If anyone could get a hold of Will, tell him to call the show.  There's no...  Nobody can...  Poetry sucks.  It does.  We hate poetry.  It just sucks.  It stinks.  They were doing a...  Liz at the Comedy Cellar, who's the best. 
[02:02:00]  They were doing a farewell party.  She's like the assistant manager there, or the manager, whatever.  And some girl from the underground got up and read a poem.  Ooh, fucking poetry.  Poetry stinks.  This is what Keith...  She did it without a microphone, and she got a laugh on one of the first lines.  And then Keith made her say it again, because he got a microphone.  He goes, do it again.  He made her do the verse over.  So it was like telling the same joke twice in front of the same audience.  Did he get it on a laugh?  She got nothing.  Oh.  Did he get it on purpose?  Yeah.  And then it went downhill from there. 
[02:02:30]  Keith Roberts.  Say it again.  Say it again.  She was like, no, no, no.  Say it again.  I didn't like it.  Nothing.  What was the joke, you remember?  Oh, I forget.  It was just rhymed.  It was a quirky rhyme.  And it was terrible.  It just went downhill.  I like my poems to rhyme, though.  I do, too.  You need them to rhyme.  You need them to rhyme, at least.  Don't rhyme.  Let's at least rhyme those poems.  What do you want from me?  We got Justin Bieber.  Ant doesn't want us to forget this one.  Oh, no.  There was a prison scheme brewing.  Yeah, some guy in prison wanted to castrate Justin Bieber there, David Tell. 
[02:03:00]  I know you're a big fucking Bieber fan, man.  And this isn't just prison scuttlebutt.  They actually went down and arrested these guys, right?  Yeah, I guess there's a phone call.  The phone call's being released now, I think.  Yeah?  I think that's what we're hearing.  Is that what we have?  Yeah, I think so.  For the first time, we're hearing the chilling phone calls that outline in graphic detail  a plan to kidnap and kill pop star Justin Bieber.  The calls originated from a prison near Las Cruces back in November, and the bizarre plot 
[02:03:30]  made national headlines.  Action 7 News reporter Laura Terrain has the story new at 10.  Do we go over the Bieber thing with you?  Nuh-uh.  Yeah.  No, like, the way I work, dude, the way I work is I like to know as little as possible.  Police say that first voice is inmate Dana Martin speaking to hitman Tanner Ruane in  Vermont.  He's going to use one of the things you gave him to get him out of this, and then he's  going to go take care of it.  Take care of it, authorities say, means to murder. 
[02:04:00]  And...  We went and we bought some, you know, the f***ing hedge clippers.  ...castrate mega pop star Justin Bieber and his bodyguard in New York City.  You're going to give me five larks for each one I get.  Police say 45-year-old Martin, who is doing time for the murder and rape of a 15-year-old  girl, concocted the plan to kill the singer.  We're told Martin directed a former jailhouse friend, Mark Stakey, and his nephew Tanner  Ruane using these code words.  You're going to kill the pitbulls and you're going to castrate them.  The pitbull, meaning Justin Bieber. 
[02:04:30]  Martin also instructed the hitmen how to suffocate their victim with his signature paisley  scarf.  Tie it really, really tight.  Knotted in the front once, really tight, and put it in a knot.  That cuts off the oxygen, and then you tie it in the back again, really tight, and that  just seals the deal.  But before the two men could travel from Vermont to New York to, quote, seal the deal, they  were caught by Border Patrol after taking a wrong turn into Canada.  Now both Ruane and Stakey face multiple charges.  Stakey.  This guy in jail should just, they should, the state should just kill him. 
[02:05:00]  Jim, he can be rehabilitated.  He's in jail for murdering and raping a 15-year-old, and he's trying to have another fucking, like  a 17-year-old murdered.  He should just be fucking beaten to death in jail.  Have you heard Justin's music?  Yeah.  It's true.  I don't like it very much.  It's catchy, right?  Yeah, sitting on a, sitting in front of a fire, eating fondue.  Watch his documentary, and then I can see what your opinion is.  Why does this guy in prison live?  He should be killed. 
[02:05:30]  It's an attempted murder.  He should absolutely, he's a fucking, he's absolutely valueless.  He has zero redeeming social value, as Thurgood Marshall would have said.  He should just be killed.  I like how they bleeped out the brand of the hedge clipper, whatever.  How to strangle a guy with a paisley scarf.  That went through.  That was classic.  What are brands of hedge clippers?  I know, right?  What are they supposed to get the fucking hedge clippers?  Craftsman. 
[02:06:00]  Craftsman.  I'm going to try to Home Depot.  Would you go with the Craftsman?  Get Craftsman, because if it snaps, they replace Craftsman tools.  You just have to bring it in.  They're guaranteed for life.  Yes.  Oh, fuck.  I love a good Craftsman tool.  Well.  Wow.  So what can you say, right?  That's about it.  Are they arresting those guys?  But Justin, you've got to assume.  You know, he's got like a huge wall of security around him.  You know, like his own personal army.  Definitely.  People, you know. 
[02:06:30]  Giant black men.  Right.  Hang around to beat up anybody that comes close to him.  Oh, does he comment on this?  They won't.  They made some generic comment about the safety.  They're committed to keeping Justin and his fans safe.  You know, real generic comment.  You think he like washed his balls extra special that night?  Yeah.  Just like looking down at him going, oh, boys.  I almost lost you guys.  Did they say ten large a piece, meaning for each nut? 
[02:07:00]  Was it five?  It was five grand.  Five a nut?  Ten grand to bring the balls of Justin Bieber.  You guys paid less to have two guys fucking throw their dignity on the ground in front of their wives.  Fucking.  They were virtually castrated.  I don't know if he needed his balls for like some weird potion to get out of jail like an Inviso.  Inviso.  He could just walk right past the guards.  Some hobbit kind of.  He's a warlock?  Yeah.  Some amazing people.  He met a voodoo black man in prison with a baseball badge. 
[02:07:30]  Give me the balls of Justin Bieber, man.  I need some scuda pies.  You know, like all that prison food.  Some ramen noodles and the balls of Bieber.  I need Nicolas Cage's original hair from the top of his head.  Or maybe it's something totally worthless.  Like they just make great iced tea.  Hey, this is great iced tea.  Bieber balls.  They're a little ball-y. 
[02:08:00]  Bieber balls.  That's good.  God, bringing him back.  That guy should absolutely be killed by the state.  He should be just killed.  Wiped out.  Maybe they were just bored in prison.  Just fucking bored.  Yeah, dude, it is just bored.  They're just bored, you know.  What the fuck?  Let's get some shit going on here.  Yeah.  They know it'll probably never happen.  I think Justin is living on borrowed time now.  I think he really should cross off his bucket list of other amazing things he could do.  Yeah, one direction's taking his heat.  He's hit the, uh... 
[02:08:30]  I think he can't get any higher on Twitter now, right?  No.  So he's that guy.  That's it.  Has he been more than Lady Gaga?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's beat her.  He's now number one, but Lady Gaga will come back strong.  We know it.  Once he changed his hairstyle, he actually beat her.  Oh, that's all it was.  The Pope.  The next Pope.  Like, he probably could pick it as, like, a wild card.  You know?  Yeah.  Like, if there's a tie, they go to Bieber.  Pope Bieber.  Yeah.  Is the Pope done?  Another week, right?  28th?  They throw some Americans in the mix now, too.  To a Timothy Dolan?  Yeah.  It's Boston versus New York now. 
[02:09:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I hope Dolan doesn't get it.  Why not?  Hey, because he's a big apologist for the church.  He's awful.  Dolan will not get it.  He's fucking awful, and I hate him.  Well, the Boston guy's pretty cool, no?  Who's the Boston guy?  Well, who's your favorite cardinal?  Come on.  I like the one from Ghana.  He has a nice smile.  Sunny disposition.  Who's your favorite cardinal?  Come on, get with it, guys.  He just wants to stay out of Ghana.  I'll do anything here.  Sweep up.  Be the Pope.  I don't care.  I like the Vatican.  I don't know the cardinals.  What's the guy from Boston? 
[02:09:30]  What's his name?  He's the Boston guy.  Bernie Law?  Oh, Jesus.  Bernie Law.  The trading cards to keep up with the cardinals.  It was quite a scamp.  Yeah, that was a great idea.  Piece of garbage.  It would be a good idea, right?  Yeah, cardinal trading cards.  With all their fucking stats on it.  How many fucking boys they've touched.  Yeah.  You think some of those cardinals touched some boys?  I love that.  Yeah, like rookie of the year.  I love it.  Like your first year, however many kids you can fuck without getting caught.  Jesus.  18.  He fucked 18 his first year in the seminary. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  Put up some numbers.  Yeah.  Impressive.  The College of Cardinals.  That's an interesting school.  I don't know how you get in there.  There's a college of cardinals.  It's a school that meets what?  That's what it's called.  Every 30 years or something.  Fucking crazy thing.  And that last guy, he increased it.  Like doubled it.  So now it's more like a community college.  Like anybody can get in now.  You know?  That's too bad.  You got to know somebody to work your way up.  Yeah.  You know?  I think it'd be really easy.  There's a really easy entry question.  What was God's son's name? 
[02:10:30]  They spy a J&C.  When is Christmas?  Spy a J&C.  I don't like bagels because.  So are they going to pick that shit right away?  Or is there a little time off between him leaving?  It's really up to Tom Hanks now.  Tom Hanks is going to figure it all out.  And the Illuminati.  What are you going to do without a Pope for a while, though?  I don't know.  What are you supposed to do?  Godless.  You're all Popeless.  That's why the asteroids are hitting us. 
[02:11:00]  Is that it?  It's because of the Pope.  Yeah.  Now, can I?  I know you guys probably covered this asteroid thing forever.  But what if that asteroid had hit Chernobyl?  Wouldn't that have been like in a crazy, like, not again?  You know?  That would have been.  That would have been cool, right?  And there would have been some radiation.  Right.  It would have been a shitty horror movie.  Another one in around fucking two years.  Yeah, that would have been good.  Every time I'm on the road, I'm like always debating whether to rent that movie.  Rent that Chernobyl.  I mean, it's good enough for the road.  Paranormal activity Chernobyl thing.  Is that when a guy goes back to Chernobyl?  He takes a bunch of people to go there for some kind of extreme tourism thing. 
[02:11:30]  Are you ready to go?  This is going to be fun.  We have to leave.  It gets dark soon.  The one guy from Hostel.  Truck is broke.  When you need Dan Soda.  Where is he?  Can you do a good Russian?  Yeah, that's about it.  But then there's the happy Russian-like Yakov.  Come to my dinner adventure.  Is that a dumb movie, though?  Branson, Missouri.  What if the X-rated hit Yakov?  That would have been an incredible clean-up. 
[02:12:00]  That would have been amazing.  Yes.  Get on the hazmat suits.  They're saying that thing is a thousand times bigger than they initially thought, by the way.  At first, they thought it was a little fucking thing.  Now, this is the one that hit Russia?  Yeah.  How did they see it was a thousand times smaller?  And how did they not know it was coming?  They know the other one was coming that didn't hit us.  A thousand times bigger.  Yeah, if it was a thousand times smaller, how would they have seen it?  It doesn't take a large projectile to make a very big light when it comes to the atmosphere.  It's made up of iron and all kinds of metals that burn up in the atmosphere. 
[02:12:30]  This one wasn't.  No, you're wrong.  This one was made of horse hair.  How did the horse hair get into space?  That is the question.  Oh, I'll have to look into that.  You know, until they launch that satellite that's supposedly going to see the whole universe  that we can, you know, see these asteroids and meters and stuff like that, it's really  up to amateur astronomers to kind of guard the Earth against these attacks from God.  And, you know, the guy, I guess, who was watching that area of the sky, you know, got a girlfriend 
[02:13:00]  or, yeah, had a play date or something.  Yeah, because that diesel movie was opening.  It was his area.  He couldn't go into the sky that night.  The really big one that passed close to Earth within 17,000 miles, that one was found by  just some amateur astronomer with his telescope saying, hey, look at that, something's moving.  Something's moving toward us.  And there's plenty of those things.  How many people died off of this one?  None.  No one died by 400 injuries. 
[02:13:30]  They fucked up some people.  Broken glass and falling serious.  Did anybody get hit by it?  No, the shockwave, though, it was an explosion that the shockwave busted windows and caved  in some roofs and shit.  But they're saying it was a missile, man.  Yeah, man, of course it was.  The conspiracies have begun.  How do you not hate conspiracy theories?  It's just the worst.  There's such fucking babies who just need to delve into something else.  Because I've seen things that have blew your mind. 
[02:14:00]  I'm a fighter.  Really?  Have you?  What's your show on this week?  UFOs.  His whole conspiracy thing has now gotten just ridiculous.  We're going to examine time travel.  He's got his son on the show now.  And fucking, what's his name's son from...  The Ultimate Warrior, son?  No, no, that would be great, though.  Who's the other guy?  Fucking made JFK. 
[02:14:30]  Jerry Shepardini?  Yes.  Oh, Jerry Shepardini.  Nice.  Oliver Stone's kid.  Oh, why would Oliver allow his son to do that?  So, Oliver Stone's kid...  How about Oliver give him a cool movie he could direct for him?  Well, no, and all Oliver Stone's kid does is walk around and mug like fucking he's in Zoolander.  He looks like a model.  You know, he's just like, well, governor, we've checked out the scene.  And he's mugging.  How old is he?  And then, I don't know, he looks like maybe he's in his fucking 30s or something like that. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, wow.  And then they check these things out, and they're always skeptical, looking at each other and nodding their heads like, yeah, right.  And when we come back, we're going to look into this time travel.  And then they come back and don't look into it.  And that's one generation.  You've got Oliver Stone, the great director, and then you've got his son being all wacky and shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Doing conspiracy stuff.  Yep.  What the fuck?  That's it.  By the way, just because people are asking, it was 10,000 tons, the meteorite.  Wow.  And what do you get another day older and deeper? 
[02:15:30]  I was watching on YouTube last night.  That's pretty fucking big.  Yes.  Interviews with astronauts who have seen UFOs.  I was just like watching Buzz Aldrin talk about something.  And Larry King, he said it wasn't a UFO that they saw on Apollo 11.  It was a...  What was it?  Something that they had jettisoned from the craft that they...  Big loads of shit.  That's what he said was weird.  And he even said that in Buzz Aldrin speak.  He said it was floating duty.  But he was...  Too...  There's one video that's edited, I think.  He's saying that it was not one part of the craft, but I think it was the other. 
[02:16:00]  So it looks like this video was edited.  Yeah.  But there's a guy named...  An astronaut named...  Jerry Shepardini?  Yes.  Dr. Edgar Mitchell.  Oh.  Yes.  For real Edgar?  Oh, yeah.  Edgar.  He's 77.  Edgar Mitchell.  And he believes firmly.  He's saying that there are cover-ups.  He has the world's longest moonwalk.  He did a nine-hour, 17-minute moonwalk.  And he said that...  Wow.  Like Michael Jackson.  Why do we know this?  What's that?  Why do we know that a guy walked on the moon for nine hours?  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  He was at a dance.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  He was at a dance contest.  Yeah.  He was trying to win a car.  Well, why do we care that he was walking around for nine hours?  It's on the moon.  Well, he's on the fucking moon.  No, I'm just saying we should know his name.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Most of us don't know his name.  Mitchell.  Mitchell.  Edgar Mitchell.  He's 1971.  He did it.  But he's very...  He said NASA and the government has been covering it up for years.  We have been visited.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  And he said that they...  That's horseshit.  And NASA's...  He's a hard guy to write off, though.  You don't believe in UFOs?  He's a hard guy to write off. 
[02:17:00]  No, I believe in UFOs, unidentified flying objects.  I don't believe they're from another planet.  They all say they've seen stuff.  I forget how many astronauts have seen things flying alongside the craft.  A lot of them have.  Would he be totally, completely privy to everything the government's doing?  Not everything, but a lot more than those people.  So maybe he absolutely saw shit, but it was stuff the government was, you know...  Oh, no, no, no.  None of that?  I'm just trying to figure out this guy.  No, in space...  Oh, in space he saw shit.  Yeah, I think a lot of them have seen craft following them in space, or they've seen things  flying.  It's really hard to write them off because they understand propulsion systems. 
[02:17:30]  They understand travel.  They understand all of these things in physics.  Like, they know what I'm fucking...  And physics?  In physics, yeah.  You know, but up in space, a lot of shit just changes.  You know?  But they understand this stuff.  You've been there?  Certain rules that fucking...  How do you know?  Yes.  He's been there with his helicopter.  I was dreaming.  Almost.  You're right, but they understand this stuff.  Almost.  And he's a guy, he said...  And NASA's response to him was, Dr. Mitchell is a great American, we just don't see eye 
[02:18:00]  to eye on this issue.  They were very careful in their response.  How's his brain, though?  You know, I...  Is he stable mentally?  Just because he's a former astronaut doesn't mean that he couldn't be a little loopy, or  he could just be wrong.  Got some of them fucking radiation rays in his head when he's trucking around the moon.  That doesn't fuck you up.  So many of them have seen stuff.  I've seen fucking Alaskan sea diggers that lose it after an hour trying to find gold.  Yeah, he's on the moon. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, this cucksucker's on the moon for nine hours.  That's gotta be creepy.  They understand the way, you know, what...  Like, they're not gonna see something and go, oh my god, it's a UFO!  And it's a North Star.  Like, they know what that is.  But what did he say, specifically?  I don't know.  I was just listening to him talk about how he'd been visited.  I gotta check that out.  Yeah.  I kind of buy that, though, because we went...  We jumped technology-wise in the last 70 years.  Oh, fucking...  We went...  We're really just fucking flying.  Mm-hmm.  Somebody came and said, here, check this phone out. 
[02:19:00]  You think?  I don't know, dude.  We were fucking digging holes and fucking, you know, stone wheels for a long time.  And in the last hundred years, we flew forward.  My problem here is that in the 50s and 60s...  16, is it legal?  Right.  It's a problem.  In the 50s and 60s and even 70s, when all these UFO pictures, you have books about them  and they took pictures in the paper and whatnot, we're taken by people that just happen to 
[02:19:30]  be walking around with cameras at the time.  Now everyone has a camera, at least one on them, at all times.  And we're not seeing...  Wait.  Yeah, you are.  ...more UFOs.  Have you YouTubed fucking UFOs?  Yes, I have.  We're not seeing them.  I have an answer to that.  No, we're seeing little dots in the fucking sky.  I have an answer to that.  Fucking saucers.  If the UFO people are way more advanced, now they're fully aware that we got this technology,  so now they're fucking...  Oh, they're laying back?  They're laying low for a little while. 
[02:20:00]  And what if they're laying low?  They're more advanced now than they were in the 40s.  You know what?  Yeah, they're laying low.  They're not stupid.  They know that they can be seen now.  I didn't know that.  There are simply...  I'm sure there are ways, and it's not even crazy to think that if you're that advanced  that you could punch through a wormhole and wind up here...  Yeah.  Wormhole!  You could figure out a way to not be photographed.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  That's what's going on.  That might be nonsense.  But it's hard to write off astronauts.  Or how about they said, all right, we've got to go with the invisible technology we have. 
[02:20:30]  Get off me.  Now we need to do our fucking invisible technology.  Cloaking device.  What about all the airline pilots that have seen shit?  Yes, there's been a lot of airline pilots, too.  But those guys are all also drunk airline pilots.  Yeah, thank you.  They're a bunch of drunks, Bob Kelly.  Meanwhile, they're letting babies get flapped while they're out there having a cosmic voyage.  They're not all flying upside down.  Yeah.  Fucking hotel rules.  Fucking flight.  I saw it.  He was drunk.  The airline pilot was actually a good movie to you. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, right?  It was a happy ending.  It was a happy ending.  Right off an airline pilot.  The cool thing would be, like, if this guy had this amazing theory, and then, like, in  the movies, he has a mysterious death, like he's pushed in front of a subway.  Yeah.  For an astronaut to die in the most common, pathetic way.  Oh, man, that would be bad.  They just find his skin.  Dave Attell, our favorite one ever, a guy invented the technology where cars run on water.  Yeah.  And he went to the press with the whole thing, guy dies of food poisoning after someone from 
[02:21:30]  the government paid him a visit.  He made him a visit with him, apparently.  Wow.  This is a real fucking story.  He had one of those mysterious deaths after announcing this amazing technology that was  going to change the world.  Whoops.  And what happened with the technology?  It went bye-bye.  Yeah, it was all in his head.  Do we have the news story?  We have to get Benny Stone on that Ollie Stone's kid.  Yes.  Whatever his name is.  You could believe what you want.  It's the best. 
[02:22:00]  I know.  I've seen things that'll blow your mind.  Remember Water Guy, though?  I saw the episode where he was at Area 51.  Oh, yeah.  If we go up that hill, we could be shot.  We'd be shot.  They're going to shoot a governor.  No.  I'll shoot you, though.  You former fucking bubble-wearing wrestler.  Stop.  They kept teasing that they might get shot, and then they just backed out and turned around.  They tease everything.  He was trying to get to Plum Island.  Yeah.  You know, off the animal fucking virus. 
[02:22:30]  Plum disease research island.  Research island.  Sounds charming.  They're trying to get there, and they're on a boat, and they see some Coast Guard and whatnot coming at them,  and it's right before a commercial.  He's like, well, they'll set up a blockade, but they're not stopping us.  And then they go to commercial.  They come back, and he's like, we're turning around.  They're like, what the fuck happened?  He made me sit through the commercial.  He's an ABC.  Why didn't he, like, swim in, you know, with that thing on there? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, a little scoop of tech.  With a knife in his teeth, right?  Yeah.  He's been taking a skull ring.  Putting on a rebreather.  A rebreather.  A rebreather at my AK-47.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, fuck, you know, we got to pump up the David Tell Jim Norton show.  That's this weekend, right?  Friday, Saturday.  Holy shit, it's upon us already.  Vegas, MGM Grand.  That's a great show.  Yeah.  When are you guys playing?  Friday, Saturday?  Yes. 
[02:23:30]  Friday, Saturday, two shows at the MGM Grand in Vegas, Norton and Tell.  It's great.  That was one of the best fucking times I had at the MGM for the fight.  For UFC?  Unbelievable.  I like that MGM.  That whole complex they have now outside with the pools and the fucking sidewalks and the cabanas.  Why didn't you like that?  I hated it.  It was great.  It was fucking great.  The thing I didn't like was the fucking mile walk we had to take to the hotel.  Aw, pity.  Do you remember the old thing? 
[02:24:00]  I'll walk a mile for a chocodile.  What?  I remember I'd walk a mile for a camel.  Yeah, I remember that.  No, but isn't there when I'd walk a mile for a chocodile?  No.  I remember chocodiles.  Maybe growing up in South Africa, that was one of your little scotch.  That's where you beat the limo driver or something.  I'd walk a mile for a camel.  I do remember that.  I remember Tarantin.  You'd rather fight than switch.  So you guys are in Vegas this weekend?  Yeah.  Where are you going to be, man? 
[02:24:30]  It's going to be a good show.  You're going to be in my second home.  I'm at Philly this weekend.  Thursday, Friday.  Yeah, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Helium Comedy Club.  Nice.  I haven't been there in like three years.  You're going to have to see some of my boys.  Got some tickets laying around?  Yeah, of course.  Got some comps?  Of course.  Nah, they'll pay.  They don't pay.  It was.  Do you have a copy of New York?  I don't have it here, but I'm seeing it in print.  What?  What?  Before.  What does he say?  Wait.  What?  Are they hearing what you're saying to me?  No.  They were all talking.  I don't know.  No, he picks who he wants to talk to. 
[02:25:00]  I didn't know that.  I can hear him.  Yeah, I know, but he said the hostess thing.  I hear him, yeah.  No, now you hear him.  But he was giving Jimmy messages before.  Oh, he can actually give you secret messages?  Yeah, yeah.  I want some fucking secret messages.  Give me a secret message, you want?  Give Bobby a secret message, please.  Thank you.  Hey.  Tell me something, Eric.  His headphones don't do that.  I guess we should tell the...  Wow.  I guess we should tell the listeners.  Every once in a while, you hear one of us go, yeah, okay, that sounds all right.  Because you're talking back to me.  We're just talking to the voices in our heads. 
[02:25:30]  We're just waiting for it to finally fucking end for you guys.  So why don't you just start smashing your head against the microphone?  This has gone out way too fucking long.  It really has.  How long have you guys been doing this?  Well, the new thing they get mad at is that I say 18 and a half years.  Yeah.  Because I guess I'm too accurate.  Why do you say 18 and a half years every time?  It's Twitter voice.  Opie Twitter voice.  Which I now put in parentheses after fucking any bonehead tweet that I get.  What am I supposed to say? 
[02:26:00]  It's 18 and a half years.  Fuck.  Hey, Anthony.  I didn't know you were in the Addams Family movie.  I really don't.  I thought Ralph Jr. was dead.  Oh, right, right.  Block.  I just thought...  You ever have the ones that get mad at you because you block them?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Shut up.  Who cares about you?  We can't take it.  So would you guys...  Hey, Opie. 
[02:26:30]  We're in Ewing.  No, I'm a human...  No, you're right.  I can't.  I'm a human being just like you, idiot.  I'm sorry.  I don't like to be fucking berated all day long.  Right.  Or even come straight.  No, you're 100% right.  Yeah, we can't take it at times.  What did you say?  It's terrible.  It's a berated joke.  Oh.  I didn't hear it.  I have a Cialis run.  You gotta start planning that.  But good news, people.  I wish I could block Norton.  Scooby-Doo is on Broadway now, so we're all...  Oh, wow.  Who's playing that?  This is on Fox News, by the way. 
[02:27:00]  You know we got a mystery to stop, so Scooby-Doo...  Oh, my God.  I got to get such huge chills.  Did they just shoot on that?  Don't hold back.  Please don't stop this.  Mystery.  Cause Scooby-Doo, when you come through, you're gonna have yourself a Scooby snack.  Oh, that's so fat.  Norton looks like Velma.  Scooby-Doo-Bee-Doo, here are you.  You're ready and the villain.  I'm just fucking stunned.  This is a real one. 
[02:27:30]  This is fucking hilarious.  I love it.  Scooby-Doo, I know we'll catch the villain.  They're dancing around and...  You like the dog?  Scooby-Doo.  Is this on Broadway?  Oh, and then, look, Scooby just made a watery shit on the stage.  And Velma's smearing his nose at it and telling him no.  No.  Oh, no, look, they're putting mitts on Scooby.  And Velma's got her pussy hanging out of the back of her panties. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, no, they're getting the oven mitts.  That I'd watch.  That I'd go to see.  That would have to be off Broadway, though.  The blonde fruit with the ascot is trying to help Scooby guide his pink dick into Velma.  The guy with the Charles Nelson Riley aspect.  Wow, that looked horrible.  What is that, though?  Is that an off-Broadway thing?  I think you're right.  I think they're fucking hilarious.  They're doing Scooby-Doo on off-Broadway.  Broadway has also run out of things to do.  Just like this show.  That is just...  What?  Sucks to be Scooby. 
[02:28:30]  How bad is that?  It makes Spider-Man look like...  Yeah, yeah.  Twelve Angry Men.  A must-see.  We've got a break.  That's terrible.  David Tell, Jim Norton, MGM, Vegas.  My show starts in one hour, by the way.  Friday and Saturday, Jim Norton's Advice Show at 10, if you guys want to stick around for that.  I love that one.  And Bob Kelly's going to be at the Helium Comedy Club in Philly starting tomorrow night.  Yeah, tomorrow night, yeah.  That's going to be a great show.  I'm excited.  I like the club.  I'm glad to be coming back. 
[02:29:00]  I texted you last night, right after your set.  Because that baby shit is fucking killer.  Oh, thanks, man.  Dude.  Bob's got a whole new set with baby shit.  That fucking shit about what you're doing to the baby feeders.  Oh, my God.  It was so fucking funny.  They were keeping people from opening the doors and going in in between until it was in between comics.  So it wouldn't like people flying in.  Basically, when Rich Voss went back on stage.  Right, then people could leave and come in and shit like that.  So there were people outside watching on the monitors. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  And I was sitting there watching that for a little while.  And when you went into that part of the act, holy shit.  Everybody was like laughing their fucking asses off.  You broke down babies and pregnancy.  I mean, man.  People got to check it out.  It's fucking great.  It's great.  Are you having baby?  You're having baby, Jimmy.  Oh, congratulations.  Thanks, buddy.  Okay, cool.  Are you ready for this?  I'd love to.  Let's think of some baby names.  I already got it.  What is it?  It's a...  I know.  I'll tell you.  The boy's name is Wolf.  Soda.  Really? 
[02:30:00]  Name your kid Soda.  Why?  It's a good name.  Soda?  Soda.  Why?  Who the fuck is Soda?  It's a Seinfeld reference.  Oh, is it?  Really?  How about naming them?  Chimple.  Ugh.  I would love to.  This is the OPNT Channel.  What's SiriusXM?  It's time for another edition of Jailhouse Cooking with your host, Bernard Hopkins. 
[02:30:30]  In today's episode, Bernard is going to show you how to boil water to make instant soup  in prison.  For a soup that they sell in commissary at the store, you take a socket of a stinching  cord, you cut it, you put some batteries on the end of it, sort of look like a dynamite  wrapped up together.  You take a plastic bag, you cover the battery up so you won't get no rust or no kind of bacterial  poison from the battery.  Plug it in.  Now you got hot water.  Now you put it in your soup.  You got instant soup from an instant soup cup. 
[02:31:00]  Stay tuned for another edition of Jailhouse Cooking with your host, Bernard Hopkins.  Only on the OPN Anthony Show.  I just don't believe in them.  Not at all.  We're talking about pillow tops.  It's a terry cloth.  How are we going, Joe? 
[02:31:30]  Let's set the stage here.  We got the great David Tell.  Yes.  He's playing with the great Jim Norton at the great MGM in Vegas Friday and Saturday  night.  What are you waiting for?  Get your tickets.  It's going to be a great show.  And the MGM is a great place.  Someone's working with us, too.  Who?  Yeah, who did you get?  A local guy from out there who weren't working with me before.  He's funny.  Why don't you bring your local friend?  Let me open for you fucking twats.  Nah, you can't open it.  You can't do that.  You're too good.  I would love to just be on. 
[02:32:00]  I love being on shows with my friends.  We couldn't pay you what you'd.  You know what I mean?  I miss it.  We couldn't fulfill your rider.  I'm going to be alone in Philly.  That's a great town, though.  My rider is fucking ham and Gatorade.  You're fine.  You're a nice deli spread.  Oh, and a candle.  I forgot.  Who do you got for your helium show, Bob Kelly?  You know what?  I'm so fucking lazy.  They have somebody.  I don't know.  I'm going to show up.  It's going to be, hey, I'm fucking.  But I don't know.  I heard they're all right, guys. 
[02:32:30]  God, you're really selling your show.  No, I heard it.  What the fuck, man?  Well, I'm going to be there.  That's all you fucking need.  That's an amazing club.  That's exactly what I'm saying is I'm on the road a lot by myself, and you just show up.  I don't know.  But I heard the guys are good.  I actually asked somebody, and they said they're really good.  Why don't you bring Triple J, Jesse Jackson Jr.  I'm going to bring Big J with mittens.  J would be good, man.  He's a hard follow.  He's strong.  Yeah.  His dumb hairdo.  What?  His hairdo is awful.  Two different colors.  All right. 
[02:33:00]  All right.  That's just the sleep out of me talking about it.  He looks like Matt Damon, his hairdo, at the beginning of his career.  This fucking Jesse Jackson Jr. thing is ridiculous.  Triple J?  Triple J.  Triple J.  It's fucking ludicrous.  Oh, he's got...  He's a good-looking kid, though.  He's...  What does he have?  Bipolar.  Yeah.  It's amazing how quickly you get a mental fucking problem when you're in the shit for three-quarters  of a million dollars.  What a scumbag.  He looks like Cassius Clay. 
[02:33:30]  He looks like Cassius Clay.  I'm a handsome man.  What did he do?  Co-sale.  Jesse Jackson's cape, $4,600 for a fedora.  He bought a $43,000 Rolex.  These are all with misused campaign funds.  With three J's and gold.  Yes.  What a typical...  Triple J.  Politician.  Politician, exactly.  He got a three-knuckle ring, JJ.  He's a good-looking kid.  And his fucking wife is also a crook.  What?  She's on some fucking committee, some board, some bullshit thing that she's accused of 
[02:34:00]  misappropriation of funds.  So she's an alleged crook.  And he's Mr. Appropriation of Funds.  Misappropriation of Funds.  He bought several fur coats and some diamond somethings.  Yes.  Capes.  They bought capes.  Who buys a cape?  Count Dracula.  A diamond.  Do you have to act like such a typical...  He needs a cape.  Yes.  Politician.  Exactly.  A Mexican wrestler needs a cape. 
[02:34:30]  He's still going.  There's a lot of people that need cape.  Superman.  Superman needs a cape.  Yes.  Superwoman.  Batman.  I think when this motherfucker...  The cape crusader.  Canaveral needs a cape.  There goes your cape bit.  Oh, boy.  A town needs a cape.  Cape town.  Cape town.  Jesus.  Fear.  Earth needs a cape.  Because they're delicious.  Capers.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[02:35:00]  Capers.  Oh, shit.  I like that one.  I think when he went in and said he was going a little crazy and went to the hospital.  I think that's all horse shit.  Yep.  I think you're right.  I think it's all bullshit.  Bunch of bullpuck.  It's something that you can't really fucking prove it.  That would be a good fight.  Jesse Jackson Jr. versus Jesse Ventura.  Are you taking notes, Opie?  Opie, what are you doing?  I'm doing my Sudoku puzzle.  Are you shitting me?  No, we all do our things.  It's all cool.  I thought your thing was a radio show. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, but what?  Get off me.  We all do our things.  It's yours is Sudoku.  Yours is...  And Jimmy's is touching another man.  Stop it, you fucking...  He gets to look at tits.  I don't have to look at tits.  Cocksacka.  We do our things, Bobby.  Can you stop gently caressing me, please?  I'm fucking just touching Bob.  Bob grabbed my dick last night.  I didn't object.  Bobby!  With his face?  Every once in a while.  No?  I don't care.  With his face.  It's clumped up, too.  I had a Cialis yesterday for my massage. 
[02:36:00]  You took a Cialis for a massage.  Exactly.  Was it a complete happy ending thing?  Did you hear what I said on stage about him?  No.  What was it?  He said his...  Yeah, fucking...  Tell Jimmy stuck his hand down.  He said his dead friend would approve.  I said I got a massage, and a girl sat on my face, and I ate her ass the day I'm doing  a benefit from my dead friend.  Oh, that's beautiful.  Where were you?  It was a great...  I think I read it all right.  His mother enjoyed that.  Georgia enjoyed that.  I was wondering if she would enjoy that.  She did.  She laughed.  And here's Bobby grabbing Jimmy's dick. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, man, that is.  You missed some fun.  Damn.  Yeah.  I'm wandering around.  That was an interesting backstage, too.  It was terrific.  It was weird.  It was all over the place.  Am I right?  Yeah, my feet were hurting.  But there was no coffee, though.  Was that like a...  Fucking annoyed me.  I didn't have any cookies.  It was nothing.  I didn't have any.  Hard for you.  Excellent fruit spread.  Cookies, fruit, and water.  Yeah.  Yeah, it really was weird.  Those cookies are half moons.  They had quarter half moons.  They look so good.  I'm going to flop those in my mouth.  You know, easy would be to fucking put six of those down.  What were the things... 
[02:37:00]  What were the things...  Stop touching me.  No, I'm trying to ask you a question.  I know you are.  You touch me, I'm going to break your little pinky finger.  Oh, jeez.  Which is like...  All your fingers are pinky fingers.  The little guy.  What was the thing?  What?  It was like a brownie, it looked like.  I stayed away from him.  I literally...  I walked away.  Don't say that about the people.  Jesus.  Oh, did we...  So, are we good with Jesse Jackson Jr.?  No, he's a fucking...  Triple J?  I think he's a crook.  I think he's a douche.  Yeah.  I like him.  Triple J and 20... 
[02:37:30]  When's the next election?  16.  2016.  And then he's fucking...  He's up on these charges, and he says he's a mental patient, and they put him in the hospital,  and they still voted him in.  Hmm.  In last November.  Same as Marion Barry.  Still voted him in.  Of course they did.  Of course they did.  He's got a tour.  Because rather a black guy gets voted in that's completely fucking a crook and a mental patient  than a white guy.  Who's the guy who did crack and had a hooker?  Marion Barry.  You said it already.  Yeah, he's fucking back in. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Settle down, Sudoku boy.  It's amazing.  No one judges people by the color of their skin more than black people.  And you.  Let's be honest.  All right.  But he should tour.  I think he should go out there and Cat Williams it a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  What's Cat Williams doing, man?  He's like, stop it.  He retired, right?  It's a little too late, conspiracy.  No, he came back.  He came back already.  Oh, he came back.  Yeah, well, yeah.  How long did he retire this time?  A day.  A day.  All right. 
[02:38:30]  That's a little better.  I'm retiring.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm going to retire, too.  You want some attention.  You're going to retire?  I'm going to out, yeah.  How much would it take?  Jimmy, you want people to get out?  No, you can't do that.  Forever or for a while?  Forever.  Oh, jeez.  I don't know.  Six mil?  Six mil would be nice.  That would be great.  Because now with the new tax thing, you're looking at walking with a mil.  Yeah, exactly.  Great.  Doing all doing our fair share, I hope.  You're dealing with the government 80 grand with that kind of thing.  I quit.  Jimmy wants attention.  Jimmy, you can't come to the baby. 
[02:39:00]  Jimmy, I need you.  Okay.  Come on, Jimmy.  I'll stay.  All right.  Jimmy, I'll stay.  It's a power coffee koozie thing.  Ah, gee, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Ah, Sprout.  I needed that.  Sprout.  Stupid Sprout.  He was explaining Jelly to my wife in the cab last night.  Yeah.  My wife doesn't know about Jelly.  Jelly doesn't make an appearance on the show often.  No, Jelly.  Jelly's a little boy that might have been touched.  Jelly.  It's another one of Jimmy's characters.  That's one, Jimmy.  You should do a one-man show. 
[02:39:30]  You know what Jimmy should try doing?  A half-a-man show.  Half-a-man show.  What's the Oscar?  What should Jimmy do, Bobby?  Jimmy should actually start talking to his friends.  Instead of himself?  Instead of making them up in his apartment, you fucking weirdo.  Why don't you call me and we'll hang out.  Bobby, he has a new guy.  When he's in the supermarket, he talks like an Englishman.  I was buying blueberries.  I don't know why I did that.  I was going to like some blueberries.  You guys are going to like some blueberries.  You like some blueberries.  It's fun to say.  What part of England are you from?  No, that was the whole thing. 
[02:40:00]  I was literally just buying blueberries.  I just kept saying to myself, you like some blueberries.  And there's no reason for it.  There's no context.  It was just terrible.  That's nice that you do it personally.  I do it alone.  Jesus Christ.  Wow, what's wrong?  What's happening?  That's Alan Combs.  What happened to his eyebrows?  Wow.  He never really had it.  Did Kurt Loder die and become him?  It used to be Hannity and Combs, and then they realized, eh, I think this guy's a solo.  Is that Tucker Carlton?  Well, we don't need the Combs, right?  Yeah.  Is that Tucker without his dumb bow tie? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, he finally moved on from that, I guess.  I guess, what, are we coming up on that whole thing again where they've got to cut the budget?  And they put it off the fiscal cliff.  And, I don't know, I haven't seen anything that is worthy of crowing about that's being cut.  I haven't seen our taxes go off.  Is that it?  The whole Navy?  The whole Navy's out.  The Coast Guard is now the Navy.  That would save a lot of money.  Plus, your boaters are now the Coast Guard.  That's how it works.  Thank God for Dave. 
[02:41:00]  Thank God Dave saved that boring topic.  The budget.  Shut up, Anthony.  It's not a boring topic.  Just shut up.  Bring up pussy.  Because I was talking about it.  It concerns all of us, Bobby.  It does, yes.  It concerns all of us, Bobby.  No, Bobby.  No, it doesn't.  I like the budget.  You put your ring down.  I can't even refinance because I make too little money and too much money.  At the same time?  Yeah, at the same time.  You're one of those guys.  I'm fucking stuck in the middle like my career.  Well, fuck all of you.  Well, if you want to keep paying for designer hurricanes, that's a choice.  Well, if you want to help people out in a hurricane, then sure, you're going to have to get taxed. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  As opposed to what?  Letting them die?  Yeah, okay.  We're helping them out.  Is that jacket warm?  That looks fucking warm.  It's great.  You want to crawl in here?  I do.  You sure?  Yeah, a couple of men.  Want to take a little koala nap?  Nose to nose.  Nose to nose.  Nose to nose.  Jim is an amazing when we do these shows.  We did the antisocial with Amy and Artie.  I know Jim is having a sleep problem and also he's working on new material and stuff like that. 
[02:42:00]  But he still brings it really hard.  But it's funny when his parents are there.  Did you guys see his parents?  Every time.  They always have that look of like, where is he?  I'm sure you haven't heard his side yet.  You know, like, you know, a vent look on their face, you know, like, what's going on here?  But they're great people.  They're very nice.  Oh, sorry.  Did I lose it again?  What the hell is that?  You don't like that?  Is that a real sneeze?  I tried to hold it in at the last second. 
[02:42:30]  I thought that was a...  You're fucking dripping.  I thought that was like when you, like, go into a Mexican restaurant and the guy starts doing all those weird animal noises to you.  Like some kind of, like, defiant attack on me.  Defiant.  You know, like...  You know, like when they do those, like when you go to, like, Mexico or something, they do those noises that are setting you up for hijacking.  All right.  But anyway, so it was cool to see your parents there.  I hadn't seen them a long time.  I like Jim's dad.  Yeah, your dad is cool.  He looks like you.  Jimmy always throws me under the bus, though. 
[02:43:00]  All of a sudden he goes, hey.  Yeah, I had to talk to him for a while.  Oh, he's over there.  Next thing you know, I'm talking to Jim's parents for 20 minutes.  Your dad's on.  Jim tries to fuck her, girl.  Oh, he's got to run block for Jim's dad, too.  That's great.  Trying to sink my prick into someone.  Hey, Ma, go talk to Oh, but I'm going to sink my prick into this girl for a few minutes.  I love your parents.  And I also, I met a celebrity, Bill D'Angelo.  Oh, Bill D'Angelo, yeah, my old friend who I've talked about on the show. 
[02:43:30]  Him and this guy.  Jimmy uses real names for his, you know, childhood stories.  So then when I meet the guy, I'm like, holy fuck, that's the famous Bill D'Angelo.  Why is he famous?  What story was he from?  Just a bunch of them.  When I was three, he used to throw piss on people out of the car with the cup.  Yeah, you didn't remember that story in front of his girl.  But was that the, he wasn't the one that wanted to throw the hot oil.  No, that was Stanley and Mike.  You know what?  Stanley contacted me.  He's that bodybuilder?  Yeah.  Stanless steel.  He's a fucking, he bends like.  Stanless steel?  Yeah, dude, he bends quarters with his fucking, or pennies with his fucking hands. 
[02:44:00]  I can do that.  He's a fucking easy dude.  It's an illusion.  Is it?  He actually really does it.  Yeah, I do.  You wave the penny really fast.  Oh, he's got a penny.  Like for a couple seconds, and then you bend the penny real quick.  How does that work?  He's got a penny.  Just bend it.  No one in this room has a penny.  Damn it.  Wait, I'm a Jew.  It's all in the fucking bank, you fucking nickel chasers.  None of you have cash at all.  Can you pay for this, Sam?  Could you do it with a quarter?  Hey, Kenny, I have no cash on me.  I'm a millionaire.  Can you get me a coffee?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:44:30]  I can't do 60 bucks.  I'm sorry.  Don't even, Jimmy.  I got $8.  Here we go.  I'm good.  You shake it real fast like this.  All right, Bobby.  Like this, and then you fucking bend it like that.  Do it.  I haven't done any of that.  There it is.  It's bent.  I saw it bent when you threw it.  You're going to be a good dad.  All right, kid.  That's a trick.  You're not bending the penny.  You're bending yourself.  It's an illusion, guys.  Yeah.  No, he really bends them.  Yeah, no, it's an illusion.  You can't have a name like, what is it again? 
[02:45:00]  Stanless steel.  Yeah, you can't have that name and not bend.  He takes them, and he'll bend them, and he'll just show it to you.  I don't know when you finally realize there is no penny.  Why couldn't he fight that comet, then?  Why couldn't he stand there and punch it or something?  Dude, those are pennies you can get at GNC.  They're called bend pennies.  They're real pennies.  Bend pennies.  You get them at GNC, the bend pennies, and they make your thumb strong so you can fucking  curl different.  So is your buddy on roids, or is he a juicer?  No, I think he's always been a fucking natural. 
[02:45:30]  When you look at him, you're like, he's just a strong fuck.  Really?  Always?  Even as a boy?  I didn't know him as a boy.  He's older than me.  I hang out with his younger brother.  I was 13.  He was like 25, but his brother was 13.  Did he have a weight bench in the garage, or was it in the basement, so he could work  out all year, not just when it's cold?  Yeah, I'm sure.  I mean, warm.  I don't know.  I don't think he ever went to his house.  Yeah, did he have the weights that had cement in it, and then it broke up, and then it just  made that fucking clangly noise every time you fucking curled?  Did his mom make special things for him? 
[02:46:00]  Like, I put the chicken cutlets in there refrigerated just in case you need a power protein work.  Shut up, mom!  I'm trying to fuck little Jimmy!  I can't have a job!  I'm working on my body!  I work on the Long Island Railroad during the day, and I compete on the weekends.  Have you seen my trash bag suit?  That's great.  First of all, anybody who is fucking competing in bodybuilding is on a roids. 
[02:46:30]  Do they?  Or some cycle.  Yeah, and I don't think roids are that bad.  I don't think, like, not a total fucking...  How about ham?  What?  I wish I had a fucking ham-er.  Wow.  I don't think hemorrhoids are the fucking electric company.  I don't hate hemorrhoids.  Hemorrhoids.  Hemorrhoids.  I know, I fucking...  I don't remember that.  He was fucking...  He was just doing a half a silhouette on him. 
[02:47:00]  Just go from his nose down.  Is that a Muppet?  But there's a difference between supplements and then the actual hardcore roids.  Yeah, there's a difference.  But they're still...  They're off.  Some of them are bad for your body.  Would you hate if you were, like, in an asshole and there was a big roid on it?  Oh, God.  I told you.  Me, Jay Moore, and Frosty were in L.A.  And we were at the strip club during the day.  And the girl spun around.  And as she's spinning, the faces were just changing from smiles to horror.  And then she got to us, and it was just a fucking berry sticking out of her asshole. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, fuck.  You know me.  I'm like...  I'm like fucking...  I had to open the door.  Sunlight shot in like vampires.  Breathing heavily.  It's like dust till dawn.  When they open the doors of the titty twister.  We had a fucking nugget.  A nugget hanging out of her asshole.  Was it a nugget?  Like a fat Italian lady's armpit.  One of those fucking roids.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  It was the one on La Cienega, way down the middle of the street.  I went to one with Dave.  Remember we went to the street club?  Yeah, what was that one?  It was like fucking three years ago, two years ago. 
[02:48:00]  I know, but what club was it?  That was the one on Sunset.  That's the body shop, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was when I smoked.  It was a good time.  That was, you know, whatever.  But, yeah, there's some girls that prefer not to wipe before they get up there.  They like to just, you know, be feral and let the pole do its job.  Feral.  Yes.  I was at one club, and the chick's whole routine was getting Windex and Bounty and wiping off  the mirror.  I hate when they do housekeeping.  Stop it.  Exactly. 
[02:48:30]  Just leave a slug trail on the stage and let the next fucking pig.  No one cares if the mirror's clean.  Yeah, we don't care.  It gives a shit.  Just drag your fucking beat-up cunt lips across the rug for five minutes.  Put them on my nose for a buck.  That would be cool if she had, like, a dingleberry hanging out, and that was, like, code to some  guy in the crowd to, like, activate some kind of terrorist plan.  Oh, yeah.  If you want to clean the mirror, do it with your pussy, like, fucking suckerfish doing  algae in a fish tank.  Yeah.  It just goes along.  You see a big strip getting cleaned. 
[02:49:00]  Just squat walk across this stupid stuff-a-loffigus thing in the end of your body.  She gets stuck.  Yeah, it's a signal to the terrorist, like, every day he goes there and she spins around  and her asshole's clean, and when there's one time there's a hair with a fucking half  a log hanging off of it, it's killed a Jew in the corner.  It's a Manchurian candidate with a fucking nugget.  He heads up to the Griffin Observatory, activates his plan.  Boo.  No, I just didn't wipe.  Don't go! 
[02:49:30]  I never go to strip clubs.  Never.  Me neither.  I never go.  You're a webcam guy.  I used to love going.  And, you know, now it's just stupid.  Yeah, I'd rather you fucking throw money.  Just take that 100 and go get a fucking handjob.  But I want to go now, though, and get my fucking half a rod fucking rubbed on.  Yeah.  Are you half hard now, you think?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  You can't even...  Are there strip clubs you can get actual handies or blowjobs at?  No.  No.  No, there aren't.  What's the point? 
[02:50:00]  Overseas.  Overseas, yeah.  Where?  Here, probably not.  I mean, out of the country, absolutely.  When we were in New Orleans, I went to...  Oh, New Orleans, yeah.  During Mardi Gras in New Orleans, of course.  I got one here, too.  They do it at the fucking dentist office during Mardi Gras.  Fucking jack you off.  How you doing?  Feel good?  Did you feel that?  Here at Subway.  Down in the nice ward.  Yeah.  I love it.  I'm not leaving.  I'm moving back.  Guys, you can drink right here in the airport.  Remember that guy.  That guy was great.  Tom.  Everybody wants to go to school down there now because it's like defiance. 
[02:50:30]  Before, when it was like a functioning school, it's like, can I say curse?  It's like, fuck, man.  I'm not going to the white man's fucking book factory.  Can you curse?  I mean, I think we were just saying, rub your cuntlets on the rug.  I'm sorry.  I don't doubt I was concentrating on that half-heart on.  So that's not morning wood because you're at work.  Right.  That's not bad.  See, that's the thing with the sleep apnea.  You know, your body's on a whole different clock.  Yeah, I'm all loopy.  You think Cialis may fuck what you sleep to?  Is there something that keeps you awake? 
[02:51:00]  It's a risk or take.  Exactly.  I'd rather be fucking sleepy with a heart on than fucking wide awake with a limp dick.  That's one bad hat, Harry.  What the fuck?  What's going on in here?  I don't know.  She's handing out juices.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking outward bound just walked in with a juice.  Flying a plane in 1910.  Orville wrong.  Get out of here. 
[02:51:30]  He didn't take that lightly.  I don't want to say anything.  Fuck him.  Love to.  In case he what?  In case he goes crazy.  Oh, yeah, but you know how those kids are.  Yeah, they tell.  He's in that age group.  It's the profile of one of those loonies.  White boy problems.  Shooter.  How's that juice, guys?  Oh, it looks dope.  You've got a red one.  What did you get, Jimmy?  Same thing.  I get beets and carrots.  Serable.  Spinach?  A little spinach in mine.  Nice.  Beets, carrots, spinach. 
[02:52:00]  I got the Nutribullet.  120 bucks, and it makes the juice right out of the house, but you don't have to clean  all that shit out.  How do you know?  How's it clean?  Just fucking...  What the fuck happens to it?  That don't make no sense.  How's it clean, honestly?  You just fucking clean it out in the sink.  Well, then you do have to clean it.  That's why I hate doing it.  No, but the juicer...  I love juicing, but I don't like cleaning.  I would like to go juicing without the cleanup.  Well, there's no pulp, Jimmy.  I like pulp. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, but it goes in the fucking drink, you pulp.  Oh, man.  What is that?  I don't get it.  Does that come out looking that color in your shit or your piss?  Yes, you think...  I think I have cancer three times a week.  You get bloody shits.  Yeah.  Really?  Beats.  The beats make it look bloody.  And your piss...  Dude, my piss is tinged a different color when I drink vegetables.  It gets a little reddish in the pink.  Yeah, so I love it.  Well, dark orange.  Let me know what I speak.  Beet smell coming out of it.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Asparagus piss with beet color.  I love a smelly piss.  I love it.  Is that like a diet or...  I mean, do you guys do that instead of a meal or you do that in...  No, it's just healthy.  I think it's healthy cancer fighting stuff.  Is it?  Yeah.  All this fucking...  I've never given up on that.  Anti-angiogenesis, I think it's called.  What is that?  These things that stop the fucking blood vessels from forming, which would not be able to feed  the cancers that we already have.  Yeah.  I want you to know about that.  I watched that movie Hunger for Change.  And once they fucking tell you all this shit, now you're all paranoid about everything 
[02:53:30]  and you fucking stop doing that splendid shit and...  I won't eat aspartame.  Aspartame.  Patrice used to fucking nag me about that.  It just kills you.  It does?  It's just chemicals.  All that shit, dude.  All that stuff.  There are people that have said, like, they went to doctors to try to have something diagnosed.  They had no energy.  They had joint pain.  All this fucking shit.  And then it just turned out they had to stop drinking diet soda.  That was it.  Yeah.  Not in this town.  No.  Not in New York.  Get off the sodas.  Bloomberg. 
[02:54:00]  I hardly drink any diet soda anymore.  I'm always tired.  I don't drink it.  Nope.  I don't drink it.  And I started using agave.  What?  It's agave.  What is that?  Substitute.  It's a natural sweetener.  Is that like stevia?  It's better.  It's like a syrup.  Oh!  It's a natural sweetener.  It can taste like sugar, though.  Fucking absolutely not.  But you get used to it.  Do you realize what a miracle sugar is?  It really is.  It's fucking amazing.  Sugar is a fucking miracle. 
[02:54:30]  And salt.  It comes out of a fucking thing that looks like bamboo.  And it is the sweetest tasting thing in the world.  Fucking bamboo.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Is there fruit in this, too, E-Rock?  Yeah, there's some fruit.  I don't want fruit.  There might be orange in there, Jimmy.  Why does it want fruit, though, Jimmy?  I just don't want it.  Why don't you want it?  Vegetable diva.  Why?  Yes, you are a vegetable diva.  Fuck it.  Oh, man.  Oh, it's a good fruit.  Don't get mad.  Fruit juice is all sugar.  Even though the vegetables have sugar in them, I don't want it.  Oh, is that what it is? 
[02:55:00]  The sugar?  The fruit juice is good, though.  You need that type of sugar.  That's good sugar.  It's not bad sugar.  They also threw in one beaver nut right in there.  I just had blueberries.  Mixed it up for you.  That's how you're fine.  It's blueberries and an orange.  That's what a nut would look like.  No doctor in the fucking world is going to go, you shouldn't have an orange and blueberry  at the same place.  It's not true.  Who?  Dr. Beats.  We'd go to Dr. Beats.  Unless you like the music.  It's terrible.  Are you hitting your wife?  Please, Dr. Beats. 
[02:55:30]  I'm tired.  Yes, we all are, Jimmy.  We're all tuckered out.  You've got another show after this.  I do, and Bailey J will be here as my co-host.  As I like to say, it's amazing.  She's fucking...  Bobby, show me a picture of him.  She's great.  She's amazing.  And she's a nice person.  I cannot believe all the fucking dudes that on Twitter come on to her.  I know there's three of them in the room.  It's all this...  She's a sweetheart.  Like, you're fucking the hottest. 
[02:56:00]  I was listening last time Bailey was on your show, Jim, and the explanation about how guys  will argue whether you would fuck Bailey, and Bailey said, well, you never hear people  arguing, would you fuck Roseanne?  You know?  It's like, but it's always, would you?  Would you?  Which means, yes, you would.  Which means you're just...  If you're arguing about it, it's like...  Justify it?  Right.  You're just trying to justify it.  It's not like...  I'd actually fuck her husband.  No, I'm kidding.  I'd fuck Roseanne. 
[02:56:30]  That gives away her age.  I was talking about Bailey.  I'd fuck Roseanne, though.  I'm actually friends with her husband.  Yeah.  So it's this weird thing now where I wouldn't even...  Like, I knew her first, and I thought she was hot, and then I became friends with her  husband, Matt, who's a cool dude, so now I don't...  She's kind of like his wife, so I wouldn't even...  Are they married?  It ruined it for me.  I don't watch her porn.  Wait, wait.  Are they married?  They're married.  That's the thing, yeah.  What you know in person, it's so hard to juror.  Yeah, it's weird.  So is he gay?  No.  No.  He's fucking a man's man.  He's cool. 
[02:57:00]  He's fucking a superhero.  He's a goddamn guy who knows what he likes, and he goes for it.  He's from the future or something.  I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.  He's Captain Kirk, that motherfucker.  Was he...  Is he a gay guy, though?  No.  He's a fucking man married to a hot woman with a nice penis.  But he would say he's not gay.  No, he's not gay.  I don't know what they say.  I don't know.  I honestly don't know what he...  What is he?  Does he just, like, dog her in the ass, or does he suck? 
[02:57:30]  Or does he suck?  Hey, oh, what kind of fresh talk is this in front of the juices?  Can you class it up a little bit?  In front of the juices.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, please.  Is that or does he perform oral on her, which would be a little more cooler?  A little nicer.  Yeah, he doesn't.  He just, he mushes her balls together and just licks it like a pussy.  Wouldn't the kissing make it gay?  No. 
[02:58:00]  What are you, cold-hearted?  I don't know.  Ow.  I don't understand any of it.  It's very confusing.  It's a paradox.  Yeah, but that fucking bulge in your pants said that there's some understanding going  on.  That cock understands it, doesn't it?  You know, if Anthony had a party, it'd be fucking two in the morning, he'd be slipping  out of the hot tub with Bailey.  Let me tell you something.  Anybody in this room is going to fuck a transsexual.  It would be me, and then you, and then Ant.  Why do you get to go first?  They're fighting over now.  You're going Hep C? 
[02:58:30]  I can picture Ant fucking a transsexual.  Are you going to ask some of these questions today on your show at 10 o'clock?  I don't think so.  In your hot tub?  I don't think so.  If she's a married woman, man.  I don't think so.  You'd take a nice, you'd take a fat...  I'm going to bring a transsexual to your house one time.  No, no.  For me, not you.  Oh, okay.  Well, for you, that's fine.  I guarantee if it's just you and Norton, and then she takes her titties out...  Norton?  Takes her titties out, and you have like 15 hineys in you? 
[02:59:00]  No, no, no.  Absolutely.  You're not closing the line if you lick the transsexual, because those are like products.  Oh, right, right.  It's like coming up at someone's house and like, you know, screwing around with their...  What are those plexing around with their surfboard?  It's a fixture.  But wouldn't the smell tell you it's a man?  Well, that's the thing is...  The smell would tell you it's a man, though, no?  If you kiss a tranny and her breath smells like fucking dinty more beef stew, it's like,  ah, shit.  That's when you're getting nervous.  Yeah, or if you could see a shadow, a five o'clock shadow, that's no good.  I like that.  But when you get them and they look just like girls, you're like, that's sick. 
[02:59:30]  Like right off the bus, tranny.  I haven't had time to fix my scene.  Yeah.  No, I couldn't get past the fact that it's a dude, like biologically.  No, I would not be able to get around.  Tell that to your pulsing cockhead.  Tell that to your pre-cum.  Yeah, hang out here.  Exactly.  Your cum can get past it.  Yeah, you go to take a piss, you're pissing in 17 different directions. 
[03:00:00]  Exactly.  I can't get past this, but for some reason my cock has made the leap immediately.  That fucking dickhead would swell up if you try putting it in her backside.  I'd be all confused.  Just sitting there in a half-mast like an airport wind sock.  On a breezy day.  Oof.  Oof.  So you would go with your own race for tranny, right?  You wouldn't want to experiment.  Oh, yeah.  I don't really go outside my race. 
[03:00:30]  You're going to bang a chick that looks like Keith Robinson?  Oh, God.  God damn it.  Take your dick out and let me suck it.  Shove it up my butt and stick it in my ass.  I'm a girl, motherfucker.  Yeah.  No, you're not.  You said you like guns.  Show me your gun.  Fuck me.  Yeah, I've never been with an Asian.  Really?  No, but I wouldn't like be against it. 
[03:01:00]  But as far as like women of color, no, I wouldn't go there.  Really?  Not even an Asian?  No, like an Asian still fits in the criteria.  That's fine.  Wow.  But a woman of color, I wouldn't.  Like a black woman, I just don't find black women attract.  You don't?  Really?  Just don't.  And we've tried to find one that he would be attracted to.  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody says no every time.  There are some mixes that are pretty pretty.  But as far as like your, you know, basic black, both black parents, black chick, I don't find them attractive. 
[03:01:30]  I just, it's a physical thing that I don't find attractive.  Cool.  I like white trash girls.  You like white trash girls?  I like a girl that looks like she's fucking right out of Bayshore, Long Island.  Yeah.  Uh, maybe a bartender.  Something like that.  One fucked up fingernail?  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Named their car Betsy.  It's an old Impala.  Burn mark on her thigh from a mini bike accident. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Fucking a tail nose.  Crazy story.  Yeah.  19th, 4th of July's ago.  Uh-huh.  Exactly.  Jason Bruno is out of jail.  She always looks like she has cum in her hair.  That's it.  Yeah.  Can't quite get the hair right.  Yeah.  Like all that shit looks great to me.  I like a big nose.  There's so many hot black ones.  Yeah.  Like the one, uh, the Bradley Cooper.  Who's that girl?  The, uh, what'd she play?  Spock or something on the new Star Trek?  Who is she? 
[03:02:30]  Oh, uh, she plays Spock Uhura.  Yeah, that girl.  That chick.  She's so hot.  I hate that.  I hate that.  She's sexy, I think.  Yeah, but I, um...  I hate thin, thin bitches like that.  Really?  Oh, just thin.  Just wafer thin.  Well, then don't go to Africa.  Across of a whole continent.  Dude, we had a concert.  That's over.  They're fine now.  Is that it?  Is that it?  I love it.  We just, we have one concert for every disaster.  And then we just go back to our lives.  Right, we move on.  Yeah.  Pennaflex. 
[03:03:00]  All that one's good.  Alec Baldwin.  Asian women know, huh?  I guess all the farms are fine too.  Yeah, everything's good.  Willie fixed that.  Yeah, it just takes Willie and Bruce and everything's good.  It's okay.  That's funny.  Yeah.  That's really funny.  Helium Comedy Club for Bob Kelly.  Let's get the plugs in.  And you got the Dave Vittell and the Jim Norton at the MGM in Vegas starting Friday.  Friday and Saturday night.  And I have tickets going on sale tomorrow morning.  March 29th, I'm shooting in Boston at the Somerville Theater.  We're doing two shows. 
[03:03:30]  The Friday night, it's Easter weekend, but it's the Good Friday, which is a great night  because people will be in town.  Great Friday, then.  Yes.  Mediocre Friday, if we're going by the material.  So, but yeah, it's on sale tomorrow morning at 10.  I'm thinking it will sell out.  We're doing two shows because it's not a very, it's not a giant theater.  It's like, how many seats?  1,000 seats, maybe 800 seats.  That's great.  I have a thing going on in Boston, March 15th.  I'm doing the Wilbur.  And tomorrow at 12 o'clock, you can go online and get tickets. 
[03:04:00]  Wow, Bobby.  Damn it.  You can actually go right now, too.  But I'm just trying to make it sound special.  Tomorrow at 12.  It's a big release day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tomorrow at 12, you, right at 12, it starts.  You need them to do it right at 12.  Right at 12.  Go to Wilbur.com and on my website and buy those tickets at 12 tomorrow.  It starts for March 15th at the Wilbur.  The following.  Billy Burr sold out six shows.  I am not even halfway through one.  Did he sell out all six?  Absolutely, yeah.  Six fucking shows.  In Boston. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  That is his town.  How many seats is the Wilbur?  It's going to be 12, maybe.  Maybe they can fit a little more.  And I guarantee, because he ripped out the whole floor, you know, the theater seating  on the floor and made it a replica of the old Comedy Connection.  So it's table seating on the floor.  And he can actually jam more people on the floor.  Wait, he made the Comedy Connection inside there?  He took the Comedy Connection floor plan when it was in Faneuil Hall, ripped out all the  seats in the theater on the floor, and replicated it on the floor. 
[03:05:00]  So he has just regular comedy shows in there?  It's a comedy show on the floor, and then he can take all the tables out and have a concert.  Holy fuck.  You know what I mean?  That's Bill.  Bill Blumenreich.  Bill Blumenreich.  Wow.  Actually, his son and daughter run it more than him.  Yes, his son's cool.  They're great.  I love Taylor.  His daughter and his son are cool, yeah.  Oh, I remember Taylor.  Sure.  She's great.  It's a legacy.  What, he's tapping out a little bit?  No, he's just doing the bigger venues.  He works Vegas a lot.  He works in Vegas with his other guys.  He's a good man.  Your Pinnets, your Dunhams, your Pinnets, your Frank Caliendo's. 
[03:05:30]  I got a back-to-back Caliendo Dunham.  I can't make it, Bobby.  I got to do a Dunham, a Caliendo, and then a Louie.  A Louie Anderson.  I like when the old bookers will tell you their story like, so I said to Roseanne, you're not going to make that kind of money now.  You know, getting everybody on their way down.  We had some guy that wanted to be our manager with the band years ago, and he told this just long-ass story about this contract that was written on a napkin. 
[03:06:00]  And it just went on and on and on.  And then it was like, and do you know who that was?  And at that point, it was like, who gives a shit?  That was Cindy Lauper.  Yeah, yeah, really?  Contract on a napkin, huh?  A fucking lisping asshole with a weird haircut.  How much money did she make?  She was trying to cunt you when I met her here, too. 
[03:06:30]  Was she?  Yeah, she's a twat.  Yeah, what a fucking old cunt.  She was a twat to me, too.  I was just trying to say, hi, relax.  Did she let her true colors shine through?  She did, and it was cunt color.  Yeah.  She's a cunt.  The color of cunt.  Joan Collins is a cunt.  Wow.  Yeah, she has that fucking New York stupid speech impediment.  How's she trying to sound like this?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not endearing anymore.  Stop, it's not cute.  You're 70.  Shut up.  You're 70.  That's right.  Fuck her.  Do you realize Tom Skerritt is 79 years old from Alien? 
[03:07:00]  He was Dallas in Alien.  Yeah, we don't tell you about Tom Skerritt.  He was on Top Gun.  Remember Top Gun?  He was in fucking Top Gun.  Who was he in Top Gun?  I think it was, was he Viper?  He was Val Kilmer's teeth.  Oh, yeah.  Code named Viper.  79.  He was also in A River Runs Through.  And he was in the original MASH.  Who, Val Kilmer?  Movie.  No, Tom Skerritt.  We better fucking get Tom Skerritt on one day.  Yeah, 79.  79.  Yeah.  Yeah, she'll do that. 
[03:07:30]  Wasn't he in A River Runs Through?  I don't know.  No, he was the dad.  I always said he looked young, not to a certain age.  That's a different movie.  That's a different movie.  What happened to Tom Skerritt?  Feathers of the Fall or something.  You saw A River Runs Through?  It's a fly fishing movie.  I know.  Get with it.  There's two that always look the same to me.  It's the A River Runs Through.  And then the fall one.  The river.  Then the fall.  Yeah, what was the fall?  Both of them had Brad Pitt.  Both had Brad Pitt.  Oh, how about this black chick?  No?  No.  Okay.  Come on. 
[03:08:00]  What is it?  Come on, pal.  Talk.  Fall.  Legends of the Fall.  Legends of the Fall.  Thank you, Runti.  Legends of the Fall.  Way better movie.  Yes.  But I get them confused sometimes, and I'll see it, and I'll be like, oh, I'm going to watch  this movie.  And I'm like, no, it's the fishing one.  I like the fishing one.  I hate the fishing one.  I like it.  That's what Brad Pitt develops, the new technique.  Oh, fuck that noise.  What is it?  He does the S and makes it go out further where nobody can get. 
[03:08:30]  Z.  He's really good looking.  He does the S. I'm doing the Zs.  Get it?  Sleeping sawing wood.  We got it.  Watching fishing in a movie is now like watching the computer hacker in these TV shows.  Yes.  I'll get in there through the back.  You know, just like, you know, just typing and looking.  There's some fucking techno music playing.  Ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga.  No one uses a mouse.  Not at all.  Exactly.  A lot of typing.  They're renting a car.  You rent a car. 
[03:09:00]  They're just banging on those keys.  Don't even know what the fuck it's about.  It's so funny.  You're right.  Hackers in movies never use a mouse.  No.  There's no way around it unless it's a touchscreen.  No.  They're just typing all the time.  Remember the movie Hackers with Angelina Hoop?  Yeah.  I love that movie.  I never saw it.  Yeah, that movie didn't date at all.  It's perfect.  That's the movie when I found out that Angelina Jolie's ass is the worst ass.  Really?  In fucking show business. 
[03:09:30]  Flat.  It's the worst.  Is it flat?  They'll never show it in a movie.  How do you know that?  Because they showed it in that fucking movie.  Let's find this now.  When she was Lara Croft, they didn't show it?  Angelina Jolie's ass should be fucking banned from Hollywood.  You think they padded it?  It looks like when she was hot and young, it looked like a fucking woman who had like  four kids and then lost the weight and gained it and then lost it again.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  It's fucking atrocious.  I hate an ugly ass. 
[03:10:00]  It looks terrible.  It looks pretty good there, Rob.  Why don't you turn around?  There you go.  Look at it.  There's a conspiracy.  That's not her ass.  Terrible.  Is that it?  Oh.  It's terrible.  There's not much going on there.  That's a nice looking hand, though.  The hand is nice.  Brad Pitt's hand.  Hand on her ass.  And that's beautiful.  Okay, McGee.  I like it.  Yeah, it's a terrible ass.  You might be onto something.  There's not a lot of ass pictures.  It looks like a little boy ass.  That's not bad.  That's terrible.  I would lick that.  No, you wouldn't.  Yeah, you would because you like fucking trannies. 
[03:10:30]  No, that's not bad.  It's terrible.  I'd give that a good eating sniff it.  That's not her.  That's a nice ass.  Oh, come on.  Her ass stinks.  But her whole front is great.  Yeah.  It does make up for it.  Her titties make up for it.  You're going to tell me you wouldn't like to just give her a kiss and then touch her lips?  Look how beautiful.  Even with that little pixie haircut.  That was in Her and Hackers.  She shows that fucking Florentine's haircut from last night.  That English hooligan. 
[03:11:00]  That is pretty bad.  You look like one of the wild boys.  She was so hot in that movie and they showed her tits in the pool at the end.  She had a great rock.  And that guy now is the Sherlock Holmes on Elementary.  Oh, yeah.  Jonathan something.  He is great.  You really watch that show?  I watch it.  It's one of the best shows on TV.  And he is a great actor.  He was in Drain Spotting.  Right.  Do you watch The Following or Tune?  This guy.  What other shows do you watch? 
[03:11:30]  Do you watch The Following?  I watch Person of Interest.  Great show.  How about Touch?  Do you watch that with Kiefer?  No.  I watch Psych.  Really?  Come on, son.  Do you watch Wicked Tuna?  You know what?  You can't not watch it.  If you get caught watching it, you're going to watch it.  You do watch Wicked Tuna, right?  You can't not not watch it.  It's so stupid.  There are all those fucking gold digging shows.  How about the Alaska Cops show?  I watch them all.  I watch the Yukon, the family.  I like the Alaska State Troopers.  Hey, you on the snowshoes. 
[03:12:00]  I need to talk to you for a minute.  It's never Alaska enough for me.  Sir, excuse me.  I see you're smoking salmon, but can I talk to you for a minute?  Sir, you're burning books, which is the final thing in a cabin that you burn.  What about...  I like that Hotel Impossible, I think it is, where he goes into the hotel and tries to...  Bar rescue.  No.  Yeah, he does that.  He goes, but he looks like we're going to the fucking room and there's shit on the floor 
[03:12:30]  and there's a nail in the bed and the fucking ceiling's coming off.  Fucking gross.  Fucking gross.  And then what happens?  And then he re-does it.  Oh, one of those shows.  It's fabulous.  Do you watch the stupid storage locker shows?  Yes.  You can't...  Because every fucking thing, it's like they go to the back of the...  What's this?  Is that a...  Oh my God!  Commercial.  You can't not.  Yes.  And then they come back and it's a car, for some reason, under a sheet in a storage locker.  Oh, it's just a hockey stick.  I thought it was a fucking... 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I thought it was a Civil War gun.  And I like how they value their own stuff.  They value their own stuff, which is bullshit.  Oh, this is going to bring in $200, this bottle cap.  It's like fucking...  Yeah.  That's like the guys who have the metal detectors?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a great show.  Oh, that's a great one.  That one.  I've got this buckle from...  This button's going to put me over the edge.  They promote the one episode where they're going around and it beeps and they dig up and  it looks like a pistol in the ground. 
[03:13:30]  And they're like, this looks like an old record.  And the music goes up.  Big crescendo.  And then the show actually airs and they have the tease up to that same point again.  Commercial.  They come back.  He digs it up.  It's half of a plastic toy gun.  So it's shit.  But it's worth $16.  It was nothing.  How about...  Do you see the one...  It's a big, big fucking redneck.  He's got to be like 400 pounds, six feet four.  And he goes up to houses and he's like...  He tries to get them to let them dig on their land. 
[03:14:00]  But he has like a fucking huge backhoe and he rips apart their land to find relics.  Like a whale bone or a fucking gun or Civil War shit.  Well, what the fuck?  And half the people are like, no, fuck you.  Get off my property.  And he went into the ghetto.  He went into the ghetto and tried to do it.  And he almost got fucking shot.  Is it fake though?  Is it one of those fake shows?  Yeah.  They're all produced.  They're all so fucking fake.  That Jungle Goal.  That's the real deal. 
[03:14:30]  Jungle Goal was great.  They're all fake.  Two house flippers out of Utah.  Just trying to pay their bills.  Next up, Ghana.  That one you can disrespect an African by, you know, winking your eye the wrong way.  Yeah.  That's a great show.  And they had one guy who fucking, he was going to kill him.  He had a machete.  Showed up with a fucking machete.  Yeah.  And he went at it with the security guard they hired.  They're in a fucking dirty puddle rolling around with a machete.  I saw a fucking...  And the other guy's an ultimate fighter.  So he took him out.  I saw that episode.  That was great.  He put him in a choke. 
[03:15:00]  Did you see all the work that they go into?  It's like an amazing amount of money and all this kind of stuff.  Hours just in the jungle.  And they'll get enough gold for a tooth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The little dust.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That gold, man.  They're actually getting paid more through the fucking actual sag that they have to get paid.  Just to be on TV.  Yeah.  $850 they made that day.  I saw...  Dave, I saw your Insomniac.  We went to the Pawn Stars place before it was Pawn Stars. 
[03:15:30]  That was years ago.  Those guys.  Ratings.  Everybody judges them now in reality world to those guys.  Those guys are the top.  Took off.  The creme de la creme.  Definitely took off.  That was early on.  And I'm sure in personal appearances, they must get like...  You can't even get into the shop.  There's a line out the door.  It's like a tourist attraction.  Is it the same place?  The same building that you went to?  Yeah.  Because it looked a lot different in your segment than it does now.  Well, we got to go in the behind the thing where he had like stuff. 
[03:16:00]  But we were doing it for gags, basically.  But I knew it was like...  I'm like, dude, you should...  You know?  And he's like, I'm on it.  We're...  Wow, really?  Yeah.  He knew.  Fuck.  He knew.  And honestly, those guys really...  It's cool that they're so good at it.  You know?  Like, he really is like a really learned dude.  Yeah, yeah.  What I like...  If you watch the show now, they come up to the counter and that like that.  But what you showed on your show was that little fucking bank deposit little thing where 
[03:16:30]  the guy just comes up and goes, oh, he's on the sidewalk.  They don't even let him in the building.  I got a watch.  I want to get rid of it.  And they put it in there.  He looks at it and goes, yeah, I'll give you a fucking, you know, whatever.  A hundred bucks.  But they have like really cool stuff.  Like, I love like coins and things like that.  And he knows like everything about that.  He knows everything about guns.  He knows all that kind of stuff.  Like really historical stuff.  So he's cool.  So he's brought the other kids.  I don't know.  I don't know what he's doing there.  So...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know?  The big guy.  Oh, the big guy?  Yeah.  He actually knows stuff.  He knows stuff.  Chumley? 
[03:17:00]  He's been working his way up.  Yeah.  Oh, his son.  His son knows.  His son, yeah.  His son knows about different stuff like toys and motorcycles and cars and shit.  His father's a historic buff.  But his son actually is learning that shit too.  Cool.  But I love the father.  He just looks like he's about to die.  Just he opens one up.  Oh, chumley.  And they're always just like fucking the people that come in.  He's like, I don't know, son.  I'll give him about $300 per hour.  And the guy's like, I wanted $3,000 for it.  Yeah, that ain't gonna happen. 
[03:17:30]  Some guy with a fucking Amish hat walked out.  Just told me it was worth $17,000.  And you're gonna give me two.  And he'll take the fucking shit.  He'll take it.  Well, I wanted $17,000.  I took two.  I'm gonna go to dinner with my wife.  But I found it.  And my grandmother's a dead fucking addict.  They rationalize it when they interview him.  It's like, well, we enjoyed it for many years.  And it's about time someone else gets to enjoy it.  Really?  He uses the same excuse.  It's a bar of gold, dummy.  I'm gonna buy a new rope belt. 
[03:18:00]  I'm gonna have to frame it.  It's gonna have to sit on the wall.  That's what he says all the time.  I'm gonna find a specific buyer for this.  You know, in this economy.  A big photo from Elvis.  Because then the people that actually look at it, the experts, they go, I would value  this at about $5,000.  And then he goes, okay, what do you want for it?  He goes, well, you heard him, $5,000.  He goes, nah, that's retail.  Yeah.  You know, I gotta do this, that, the other thing.  But then he undercuts him so much.  He goes, I'll give you $1,500 for it.  It's like, wait a minute.  I love when they walk out.  Who makes any money on that kind of stuff? 
[03:18:30]  And who buys, like, who's the guy, like, you know, a guy asked me if he ever come across,  like, you know, whatever, you know, Coolidge's, you know, whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, Lincoln's, whatever, tooth.  You know, I'll give you $100 million.  I guess being in the business that long, they just know people to call, collectors and whatnot.  So, yeah, well, this guy came in, he brought this with him, you know.  Every other call goes to an albino stroking a cat somewhere. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, those guys who they call have shows now, too, which is hilarious.  I know.  The Restorator guy.  Yep.  The fucking other, the car guy.  They all spun off shows.  The gun guy, they all have spun off shows.  Gun shows, not his, whatever.  Which, do you ever see, what's the one with the son of guns, right?  Yeah, that's the one with the hot daughter.  Yeah, and the cannons and stuff like that.  The fucking daughter in that show.  I don't, and they just stick her in the show.  She does nothing.  She'll just go downstairs and go, guys, is it ready? 
[03:19:30]  And her tits bounce.  Yep.  And then she's out.  I gotta check that out again.  She is fucking ridiculously hot.  And the mom's hot, too.  Little daffy ducky, but fake titties.  That's cool when they have, like, a whole family, you know, organ on it.  Yes, I do.  Oh, man, look at the time.  Jimmy's show starts.  Yeah, we're going to go into Jimmy's time.  That's okay.  Hey, Bob Kelly, thank you so much, sir.  You were great last night.  You're going to be great at the Helium Club this weekend in Philly, all right?  Yeah, it was great.  Starting what, Friday? 
[03:20:00]  Thursday, one.  Friday, two.  Saturday, two.  Okay, it says, all right, all right, fine.  Yeah, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Okay.  Helium Comedy Club in Philly for Bob Kelly and, of course, Robert Kelly on Twitter.  And you got the Riot Cast podcast.  It does very well.  You're doing good, Bobby.  Oh, yeah.  And Dave and I, Friday, Saturday, MGM Grand in Las Vegas.  Yes.  And if I could just say one thing to Bill Burr and Maureen for putting together that benefit,  that was an amazing thing.  And to all the people who came and supported Patrice's family, thank you so much. 
[03:20:30]  And Danny Ross for putting those posters together.  Yes.  And getting that all together.  Yes.  They look great.  At Danny Ross in the next couple of days on that website, make sure you buy them.  They're gone.  They're gone.  We're not making them.  I think the info is on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Stay tuned for Jimmy and Bailey J and some advice.  Yes.  All right.  That's it.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor. 
[03:21:00]  And you're a chance to speak directly with him.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  Welcome.  E-Rock is very irritated because the intern put the headphones on.  I don't see you angry very often, though.  It's nice.  I try not to be.  Yeah, but you were really fucking steamed there.  You know we're doing a show. 
[03:21:30]  Why would you take away the things that we're doing that we need to do the show?  That's a good point.  And Bailey J is here.  Hi, everyone.  The feedback, people enjoyed you very much when you were on.  That's what I heard.  I saw some good stuff on Twitter, which is rare.  Yeah.  So that was good.  My agent, my radio agent, who I don't communicate with, was really shocked.  He's like, I thought that was, I had no idea.  Oh, he was expecting Vin Diesel on a tube top to come in here and sit down.  No, I think he heard you first.  And he was like, I couldn't believe it.  Right.  And I think he's, I think a lot, I love, I love when people first find out that you're 
[03:22:00]  transsexual and they try to, they're trying to justify the feelings of themselves.  Like, God, I really want to have sex with that person.  They don't know how to handle it.  Yeah.  I, I, even on my, my podcast, someone recently was like, am I gay?  And I'm like, you're the first person to ask me this.  Because of course I get asked that question 9,000 times a day.  So what do they say?  They like, they just ask you.  Well, yeah, they're like, I jerk off to your porn to, does that make me gay?  And I'm thinking, I just, I don't even know how to answer the question anymore.  Cause it sounds so crazy.  It's like, do you want to have sex with men? 
[03:22:30]  And they're like, no.  And I'm like, then no.  Like, I don't know.  You've met gay people.  Are you that?  Yeah.  So I get that all the time.  And it's, it's really silly.  Do you like when people tell you they jerk off to your porn?  A lot of girls we have in get like really weird about like a lot of the penthouse girls,  like you can't look at their porn in front of them.  Oh, you know, I'm, I, it doesn't bother me.  I've gotten used to it.  I mean, cause my friends would call me and be like, Hey, I saw one of your pornos.  I'm like, Oh, that's weird.  So it's weird if I went to school with you and now you're looking at my porn.  Right.  I guess that, that's probably the same way for everybody.  Yeah.  But other than that, I mean, I don't care. 
[03:23:00]  People jerk off to my porn.  Just that's what it's there for.  That's what I'm getting paid for.  So do you have different role?  Like I've, I've wanted to ask this too.  Um, I, I knew one girl and she didn't do porn, but she said that like, she would like,  she would fuck guys and guys would suck her dick and all that stuff.  But her boyfriend, she would only let him fuck her.  Like she wouldn't do anything that she considered masculine with her boyfriend.  Cause that energy was so different.  Is that how it is with you?  Wait, so she wouldn't do, she wouldn't do anything masculine. 
[03:23:30]  Like she, she didn't like masturbating in front of her boyfriend.  She didn't like him to see her calm or any of this stuff.  Okay.  Okay.  I know a lot of girls who are like that.  I'm not really like that.  Cause I, I, um, I mean, I'm not necessarily that this person doesn't feel this way, but I'm,  I'm really comfortable.  I feel, I feel feminine despite having a penis.  So, um, so it, it doesn't, it doesn't bother me.  Obviously I don't like want to pee standing up or something like that would weird me out,  but I never peed standing up.  So.  But you, but that's common.  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I think for, cause for a lot of, even a genetic woman, like maybe having a penis 
[03:24:00]  wouldn't make her feel very attractive.  She might be like, oh, like I have a penis.  This sucks.  And I think a lot of trans women feel that way.  I like my penis.  I'm, I'm pro me having a penis.  It gets me on the radio.  Yeah.  It's a great way to look at it.  Your penis is, is your, is your vehicle to success.  All right.  Iraq, who do we have?  We can, uh, we can talk to, uh, Sean in Alabama.  He has a Cialis question for you.  Oh, good.  Hopefully we'll have an answer.  Hey, Jerry, morning.  Hi, buddy.  Hey, I've, I've never taken Cialis or Viagra and I'm functionally, I'm a hundred percent 
[03:24:30]  for somebody that's about your age, but, uh, give me some pointers on dosage, what to  expect, where to start, that kind of thing.  Well, you'd have to talk to your doctor, but I, uh, I like, cause I'm such a fucking  junkie.  Like I'll take the 20 milligram Cialis, I think is equal to a hundred milligram Viagra, which  I believe is also the same as a 20 milligram Levitra.  I think that's as high as Levitra and Cialis went where Viagra went to a hundred.  Um, you could probably start with a 10.  If I take one, I'll take a half a pill. 
[03:25:00]  So I'll take about 10, but I'm just, again, such an addict that I'd rather take eight.  Have, if I get six pills at 20, that's the same as getting like 12 pills at 10.  So you're getting twice as much.  So, uh, I don't know if your heart can take it, just take, uh, take a half of one pill,  you know, take 10 milligrams, whatever, and just see how it works for you.  I think it's fun.  So just out of curiosity, after you're finished, do you still keep somewhat of a fluffy rod  or how does that work?  After I come, my dick doesn't, doesn't want to do much, but I can recoup a lot faster and 
[03:25:30]  I'm horny later in the day, a lot more.  Yeah.  I've noticed that because I've taken Viagra for work and I, I've noticed that.  Do you have to for work or do you not need to?  You don't have to, but for the bigger productions where time is of the essence, they kind of just,  they want to give the girls or even some of the male actors, they want to give them Viagra  just to speed along the process. Uh, and, and just so you can maintain or get it. Um,  cause with editing, it's a lot of getting it up and letting it go soft and getting it up again.  And they want to make sure you can keep getting it up. So it's, so yeah, I, it makes you feel  like your head's going to explode a little bit.  You know, Viagra does? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah. A little bit of like, I get pressure in my head.  A very big headache. Um, Cialis doesn't really give you the headache as much.  Okay. I've never taken Cialis.  Do you, do you, uh, I've always wondered when people are performing, like I'll take a Viagra.  There's been times where I've lost my erection, even with a Viagra or with a Cialis.  It helps. But if I'm mentally, something's blocking, then it doesn't help at all. Like  it doesn't matter if I take it, if my mind is fucked up and, uh, I don't understand what's  worse than not being able to get an erection on set.  Oh yeah. And there's people waiting. 
[03:26:30]  Have you had that happen?  No, I've had, I've had where I couldn't really maintain, you know, and that's, that's kind  of annoying cause it's, uh, cause it's not really a super sexual environment as much as  you are having sex. It's, it's very, uh, there's editing and there's camera people and it's  so, so there, there is a lot of, um, and the whole thing about fluffers, that's not  a thing as far as I'm good. I don't think that's a real thing.  I've seen porn shot. You're right. It's not a sexy thing at all. I mean, it's fun to watch  people fuck, but it's not dirty. It's like, all right, come on, let's go. Give me a little  bit more. Let me see that face. Let me get it. Let me come here. Let me hear it. It's 
[03:27:00]  like, Jesus Christ.  Editing is magical. I should say editing makes it, makes it a lot more smooth and fluid and  seem more like a thing. I'm sure there's some girls that bust it out though, but I'm  amazed with people who don't need anything. Like I heard guys like Manuel Ferrara and all  these fucking animals. I can just, they could literally, they could fuck a gravel driveway.  Everybody says this. And then you hear these stories about these guys who are like sticking  needles in their dick. Oh, uh, Cabergett it's called? I think Cabergett? Yes. It's like  Italian something or it's some sort of thing. And they, they stick a needle in their penis  and it's like, Jesus, just don't do porn. Don't stick needles in your penis. I believe Cabergett 
[03:27:30]  it's called. And what happened is we had a guy on once who had that happen. Um, what's her  name from Philly, her husband or her boyfriend, uh, Gina Lynn was a guy she was with. Oh,  okay. Okay. And, uh, sometimes it won't go down and that's a major, you're going to lose  your cock that way. He didn't, he's okay, but that's a scary thing. Yeah. Never fuck  with a needle in your dick. Oh, it freaks me out. Yeah, me too. Freaks me out. Who's  next to you? Uh, let's go to Snake in Texas. He wants to talk to Bailey J. Okay. Yeah. 
[03:28:00]  Hey Jimmy, uh, Bailey. First off, I'm starstruck. Uh, ever since you guys introduced me to Bailey  Jay, that's all I can think about. Oh, thank you. I mean, I'm going crazy. I'm driving my  girlfriend nuts. She doesn't understand, you know, what the hell's going on with me. And  it's all because of you guys. That's funny. I'm sorry if you get divorced. I apologize.  Do you, uh, do you, do you want your girlfriend to watch Bailey's stuff together? Uh, well,  I'm trying to get her to, but, uh, she's a little hesitant on the, on the idea. How the hell 
[03:28:30]  can I, you know, get her to, to accept me, uh, doing that, watching it? I mean, is she  comfortable with you watching porn in general or is it specifically because it's transsexual?  Okay. So because it's transsexual porn, that might be kind of like, she doesn't know what  to do with it. She might think it's kind of weird. Well, I think it's more, she's afraid  I'm kind of weird. Oh, okay. Okay. I don't know. I mean, I, cause it's not exactly run of  the mill. It's not run of the mill porn. So I do understand how she could be apprehensive, 
[03:29:00]  but you've explained to her that you like women and it's not that you wish she had a  penis or anything. Well, I used to think I liked women until I started watching you.  I know. Well, the thing is, I mean, I look like a woman. If, if I looked like, like I  said earlier, if I looked like Vin Diesel and you were jerking off to me, I might say  you like men, but I look exactly like a woman, except I have a cock. You're smoking hot.  Well, thank you very much. That's by the way, a great heading for a singles ad. I looked exactly  like a woman dot, dot, dot, except I have a cock. That's great. Do you think that it 
[03:29:30]  is weird for women? I think a lot of times don't know how to handle it. They really, you  know what I mean? Like, and we also forget cause you know, I'm a comic and you're, you  know, in the business, like how it is different for some people. Like for me, it's also, none  of it means is weird. Well, yeah, I just don't even think about any of it, but yeah, it's  I imagine for a lot of people there, it's kind of like my boyfriend or husband is jerking  off to a fucking tranny. Like what do I do with this information? Yeah. How do I handle  that? Like this? I did not picture this in my Eat You Hollywood story. You rock. Have 
[03:30:00]  you ever? Tranny stuff? No, no, no. Just for the most part, it's not great. I'm just going  to say it. Like it's even my, my husband, he's like, I tried for a minute cause I thought  it would be cool. And he's like, and it was not good. And then I saw you and you know, he  saw me in person and that changed his perspective, but he just thought I was basically going to  be some little Thai lady boy that was going to like give him AIDS. That was basically  like this, this, the thought of what in his mind, what a transsexual was. And then I was 
[03:30:30]  not that. Thank God. Who's next. Let's go to Gary in Utah. He wants to talk about cuckolding.  Of course he does. Gary, welcome aboard.  Hey Jimmy, my wife, while we're getting married, um, she just worked in a small town after she  divorced her first husband, started working at a bar. And I mean, she fucked everybody,  sucked everybody. She was just that kind of girl. Now I have her where she just wants to 
[03:31:00]  be vanilla, but every once in a while I can get her to pay me and stuff like that. But  I want her to cuckold. How do I do it?  Well, do you want her to really fuck somebody? Do you guys talk about it? Like when you're  fucking her, do you make her tell you about it? Oh God. Yeah. How do you get her to do  it? I don't know. I mean, uh, I hate when someone is really dirty and then settles down  and you get the settled down version. Like you don't want them to be deceptive whores, but  it's like, Hey, that's part of what I liked about you is that dirtiness. I don't know how 
[03:31:30]  you get, do you think she wants to do it? Or do you think she's done with it?  I, I know she wants to, but there's just something holding her back. We love tranny  porn. She takes me while we watch and we talk about how she wants to get one. We've put  ads on Craigslist, but we've only got panty boys, no actual, uh, special girl.  Well, maybe she's afraid that if she gives you that, then all of a sudden there's nothing  left. Like, you know what I mean? She's already watching transsexual porn. She's fucking  in the ass with a strap on. I mean, she's pretty dirty as it is. She's talking about 
[03:32:00]  guys. She's banged.  She seems pretty down for the count. You know, she seems pretty down, down to pound as opposed  to most women who are like, are you masturbating? I'm mad at you. You're in trouble. Like,  fuck you. So, I mean, the fact that she's even into any of it, I don't know. It sounds  like she's doing pretty well so far.  She's a pretty good egg, right?  Yeah. Right. I mean, although it could be hot though. I mean, if that's what you're into,  I'm, I'm like a crazy jealous person. It's the idea of having someone having sex with my partner  in front of me. I cannot wrap my head around, but I know so many people that are into it. 
[03:32:30]  Like, it's so common.  Yeah. I don't know how you get her to do it. Maybe get her to, uh, suck someone's dick  in front of you. Like, don't fuck right away and just see how you both feel about that.  Maybe she's afraid of like, that you'll hate it and that you can't unsee it once you see  it.  True.  I wouldn't push her on it though. She seems like a real fucking trooper. So, you know, give  it some time. Um, maybe she's afraid that if you do, if she does it, you won't marry  her.  No, I, God, I would hope not because she knows how much I love it. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, but she just might be afraid. That's all.  Uh-huh.  Because you can't undo it.  What I can do to reassure that it'd be okay.  Keep playing like you're playing and maybe, maybe get her to, has she talked to anybody  on the phone while you fucked her? Talk to a guy on the phone first?  No, and I've tried that. She won't even do that. But when we're just pillow talk about  it, I mean, she's never squirted before with anybody, I guess. And I can make her squirt  like a foot in the hat when we're talking about and I'm finger popping her.  Well, dude, maybe she's literally, maybe she is just done with that part of her life 
[03:33:30]  and maybe you're better fucked than most of those guys. And maybe that stuff isn't  as attractive to her as it is to you in theory.  She says that I give her everything. I don't have a big cock by no means, but I give her  everything else. The emotional part of the love that she never had.  Okay. She's afraid you're going to see her with a big cock. Here's what this is. She's  afraid that you're going to see when she gets a big cock, what an animal she turns into  and how she worships it.  That might be true. I wouldn't put it past her. That might be true.  Like right now what happens is you pulled up and you have a nice little Pinto and she's 
[03:34:00]  going, this Pinto is terrific. Oh my God, I'm so happy. And she's afraid that she's going  to get into a Mercedes in front of you and she's going to go, I love this fucking car.  And then you're going to see that your Pinto will never work again. I don't know. I would  just keep talking to her about it though. What's that?  You really think that's what it is that when I hear with big cock, she's going to be ashamed  when she comes back to me.  Not ashamed, but she might not know how you're really going to handle it for real. Things  in theory are a lot of times different than in practice. 
[03:34:30]  Right, right.  So is there anything I can say to reassure her about that, that how much it would turn me  on instead of driving me away?  I mean, it sounds like she just doesn't want to gamble with your relationship, which not  to get super gay, but it sounds like she doesn't want to gamble with your relationship, which  is actually kind of nice and a little bit more important than coming.  But I explained to her, I have to have the wild side of her.  How long have you been with her?  Two years now.  Dude, she's fucking you with a strap on watching tranny porn. I'm not saying that she will eventually 
[03:35:00]  do this, but I think that that's indicates a girl who might be willing to negotiate.  Right.  Maybe she's just not 100% sure you won't leave yet. You can't reassure her. She'll come to  that conclusion. Get her to talk to somebody while you fuck her or go down on her or, you  know, you work into it like that. Work into it slowly.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, thank you.  All right, Grady. Good luck. I love this guy. She takes a shit in her hand, but she won't  throw it at me. Guy's the best. Who's next? 
[03:35:30]  Joe in Milwaukee. Need your help with a sex event.  Oh, good. I get a lot of those calls.  I don't know what that... Oh, like a sexual act.  Yeah. A sex event.  Sex event.  I thought it was some sort of get together. Okay.  It might be.  A barbecue of sorts.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi, buddy.  I'm a big fan of your lessons for years.  Thank you.  I just want to ask Bailey J a question.  Oh, okay.  Would you do the OPNS to the audience a favor and fuck Joe DeRosa in his mouth already? 
[03:36:00]  Fuck Joe DeRosa in his mouth. He would love that. He would be like Garfield with some lasagna,  I'd imagine. He'd just be so elated. That's never going to happen. I'll never.  Now, even if you weren't with your husband, you just don't have it for Joe like that, right?  Joe is like a brother and not in a hot way. I couldn't do it.  He'd be too satisfied with himself. I couldn't. I couldn't fuck his face.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You couldn't look down and just see that fucking Laverne and Shirley big ragu haircut? 
[03:36:30]  You couldn't do it?  With a big load straight across. Yeah, I couldn't. I couldn't handle it.  You couldn't just grab that fucking curly, awful mop do?  Fuck it.  I hear he's got a girlfriend now, so hopefully she doesn't want to murder me.  No, I'm sure his girlfriend is not happy, though.  Yeah, probably not.  All right. Good luck. What was the question?  Oh, fuck Joe DeRosa. Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, well, that's not what he was originally asking, but he hung up.  That's fine.  John in Wisconsin has a question for Bailey J.  Okay.  Hey, how you doing, Jimmy? 
[03:37:00]  Hi, buddy.  Hi there.  I've watched all sorts of porn. I've, you know, turned around and got interested in different types.  Is Bailey going to do anything with, like, a transgender female? Something like, what's that one?  Buck Angel?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay, okay. So I'm just, I'm still learning the terminology, too. But I think, technically, I'm a transgender female, and Buck would be considered a transgender male, I think. 
[03:37:30]  Okay.  I mean, I'm not offended. I'm just straightening this out so no one writes me any fucking letters for not saying anything.  If you want, write me.  I'm writing me.  I'll tell him.  I want to do a video with Buck. I've talked to Buck about it. Him and I would, it would be like Clash of the Titans. It'd be ridiculous.  If we, him and I had sex, and I banged his pussy.  See, that's to me, male, to me, you're much more feminine, and I'm sure Buck would be happy to hear that, but even though Buck was born a woman, it's, that freaks me out a little bit. 
[03:38:00]  Like, I don't know how to process that, because it's a male energy.  He's a man, and he has a very male energy. I know a lot of porn actresses that only work with women who are approached to work with Buck, and they're like, he's a man. I can't. His energy is so male, and he just is a man.  But, um, I want to do a scene with Buck, because I think it would be amazing, and he's actually a very, very good person. He's a very sweet guy, so I, I've thought about it before, and it could happen. He lives in, like, New Mexico, or Mexico. He lives so far away. 
[03:38:30]  He's really nice, and I was bummed out, because I saw pictures, I think, as a woman, and I like fat pussies, and it looks like Buck had a fat pussy when he was still a woman. I was like, fuck.  I never saw his pussy back, back when. I've seen him. He looked like Annie Lennox, or Debbie Harry. He was, like, so hot, so hot.  She did, she did look hot when she was a woman, you know. I'm hot. I just can't, you know, I'm into weird stuff like Jimmy is.  You know, Jimmy and I, we can butt heads about conversations later, but to see a male with a vagina being, uh, having sex with a female with a penis would just blow people's minds. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, I feel like everybody would just melt, like, complete, their faces would just fall off.  So that's why I want to do it. I even said I wanted to wear a wedding dress and have him wear a tuxedo and just have us bang it out.  But, we'll see. It could happen. Crazier things have happened.  Oh, yeah, absolutely that could happen. 
[03:39:30]  If it does happen, let Jimmy know so he can let us.  I will, believe me. You'll be the second to know.  All right. Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Take care.  Bye.  Didn't, uh, Buck Angel write to us about having a problem with Joe DeRosa?  I think so.  I heard about that.  What was the problem?  Joe was shit-talking, saying he looked like Stone Cold Steve Austin, and when we were asking the question...  That's funny.  Which sucks, because I originally made the comparison. They do look very similar, but I meant it in a nice way.  That's funny.  And Joe was trying to figure out, do you, you know, what's the right answer? Do you get with somebody like Bailey J, or do you get with somebody like Buck Angel? 
[03:40:00]  And he said, Joe said some things, and Buck didn't take it very well.  Well, Buck, I don't know what Joe said, but Buck has to realize this stuff is very new as far as the public is, like, you know, it's always happened.  I mean, there's always been, like, ladyboys, but don't expect people just to understand the relationships or the complexities of it or the terminology.  We don't know yet. Like, I still don't know. 
[03:40:30]  And I've met a lot of transsexuals, I mean, just from fucking, in the porn awards.  Right, right.  I know quite a few, and have legitimate chats, and I still don't know, are tranny's offensive or is tranny's offensive? I don't even know it.  I get in trouble, like, every other week for saying tranny or doing something that's not good, and I'm just like, oh, God, I can't handle it.  But you know how you know it's not mainstream enough?  Is there plenty of, like, obviously, you know, plenty of gay actors and gay, but there's no actors or celebrities that have transsexual girlfriends.  That has not hit. I think we talked about that last time you were on. 
[03:41:00]  But that has not hit yet. So that's how you know it's not as mainstream.  Right.  So Buck has to realize all these, like, questions. Would you do this? Or would you do Bailey? Or would you do...  That's the conversations people are having.  Right. You kind of have to accept yourself as the novelty on some level until you can get a bigger platform to talk, which is fine.  Or until it becomes more normal or more something people see.  And normal doesn't mean right or wrong. It just means the norm, more common.  Right.  Just people don't see it that often, so they have a lot of questions. This is the conversation guys have. 
[03:41:30]  Right. And he knows. He gets in trouble all the time, too, because he'll make a comment about Chaz Bono or something, because he's a very fit guy, Buck.  And so he'll say things like, Chaz Bono really needs to consider taking care of his health better, because he's a bigger guy. You know, he's heavyset.  And people will lash out and say he hates fat people. So he knows how it is.  I mean, a lot of times you can say something meaning one thing, and everybody jumps up your ass.  Yes, Chaz, the Chris Christie of the transgender community.  Yes.  At the benefit last night, Colin called him, what was it, a buffet molester? 
[03:42:00]  Chris Christie?  Voss?  No, Colin said Governor Christie was a buffet molester.  Well, he was probably making fun of Voss. Do you think Voss says that?  Oh, does he?  Buffet molester. Yeah.  Either way, it was a great line.  It's very funny.  Nick in Illinois has a masturbation question for you.  The great Jimmy, hey, I got a question about, I know you masturbate a lot.  Yes, I do.  I have a tendency to do it one or two times a day. 
[03:42:30]  Okay.  And I was wondering, when it comes to having sex with a woman, what helps you perform better or longer with a woman, because you masturbate so often?  I have to be totally relaxed and totally turned on. That's all it is. When I'm completely relaxed and there's no pressure and I don't feel the pressure to get an erection or I don't have body image issues, then I feel like I perform well and I'm good in bed, which is why I've gotten addicted to paying for it and massage girls and stuff because there's no pressure there.  What kills me sexually is pressure and feeling like I've got to be better or my body doesn't look good enough or my dick is not. All this nonsense. When I can shut that noise off, that's when I'm better in bed. And I think that's the way it is for most people. 
[03:43:00]  But does that help you last longer, too?  I mean, no, it makes me come faster, which I prefer because I take a long time to come and it's not anything to do with being a stud. It's just being relaxed or not relaxed to not come faster. I don't know what to tell you. I mean, jerking off should actually help that. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, OK.  I've heard good things about delay spray.  What is that? Numb your dick?  Yeah. I mean, I don't use it because I think the point is to have your penis feel good. But if it's about having the woman achieve orgasm, maybe if you're concerned about the woman not achieving orgasm, I had a roommate who was a total dork and left his delay spray in the living room and he swears by it.  I would lose my rod with delay spray.  Yeah. Oh, because he can't feel it.  How do you use that spray and then not numb the woman, though? I mean, how do you use it?  I've wondered that same thing. I don't have sex with women, so I probably shouldn't have said anything. 
[03:44:00]  That's a great point.  But yeah, I never thought about that. Her clit is probably like completely Novocained out.  Yeah.  So never mind. So don't do that.  Her pussy's like a fucking mouth that just had root canal.  All right, buddy.  Jack in South Dakota also has a masturbation concern.  Okay, cool.  Jimmy.  Hi, Jack.  Hi, how are you doing today, buddy?  I'm good, thank you.  All right.  Say, if the wife doesn't, you know, roll over and jerk me off in the morning, I have to masturbate to get through my day. 
[03:44:30]  I have to do it every day.  And she says that's an addiction, and I have a freaky problem.  I don't think so.  What do you think?  Well, anytime you have to do something to get through the day, I would think it's a bit of an addiction.  Maybe it's an addiction you don't care about or you're comfortable with.  But I mean, just because you don't want to call it an addiction doesn't mean it's not.  People trivialize sex addiction.  Like, come on, there's no such thing.  But if you have to jerk off every day, I'm not saying it's bad, but I would probably classify that as addictive. 
[03:45:00]  But, you know, if it's not wrecking your life, then it's an addiction you can live with.  Yeah, it is.  I mean, she just thinks I'm kind of weird that I have to get off every day.  I don't say I have to get through my day by it, but it's just my day is a lot better after I get off in the morning.  Do you have to be sexual every day or no, Bailey?  Well, I'm not asking Bailey.  I'm just fine.  It doesn't really matter which way it gets down.  No, I was asking Bailey because I know I have to be sexual every day.  I have to jerk off every day at least once.  And that's what makes me think it's not. 
[03:45:30]  I don't want to say it's not an addiction because I don't know.  But it seems just like a compulsion that comes with your gender.  And her sex drive and your sex drive are probably very different.  So it probably seems really crazy to her.  But, like, I mean, I kind of have a male biology on some level.  So I have a compulsion to jerk off every day.  I have to jerk off every day.  Or I'm horny.  It's not that I'm addicted.  It's just, like, it's better when I do.  So I do the better thing.  Do you feel bad when you're not filming it?  Like, it's just money wasted.  Right?  I'm like, I'm working overtime right now.  This is ridiculous.  I'm doing this for nothing. 
[03:46:00]  This is silly.  So everybody jerks off every day.  Yeah, I jerk off.  I'm like, I jerk off too much.  I jerk off, like, sometimes for you to think you go for the third time and your dick hurts.  And you're like, why am I doing this?  Maybe I have a sex addiction I'm realizing now on air.  Sorry, everybody.  That doesn't affect your...  That does porn.  So it's different.  That doesn't affect your erections, though, if you jerk off every day?  That makes my dick harder to work.  I mean, more difficult.  Like, it doesn't work as well.  I don't know.  Not really.  I don't think so.  I don't know.  I'm like a walking hard on.  I mean, I'm 24.  Okay.  So I'm just like a walking boner. 
[03:46:30]  It's very inconvenient.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Kim...  I'm glad I'm not weird.  No, well...  Yeah, the tranny porn star said you're not weird.  Thank you, sir.  J-Rod in New Jersey has a problem with his wife.  Oh, no.  What's the problem?  I don't believe it.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey.  How you doing?  I'm good, buddy.  Dude, I saw you this weekend in AC.  Where did all your double chins go? 
[03:47:00]  I don't understand.  Oh, thank you, sir.  I've just been hating the gym and eating better.  You know me.  Is that true?  Like, you just, like, stop eating shitty and work out?  That's it.  Wow.  I've still got more work to do.  You do look really good.  I meant to say it last time.  Thank you.  You look awesome.  Thank you.  I look a little bit better.  I mean, I still got a lot of work to do.  What are you, a buck 60?  No, I think I'm a little less than that, but I was a buck 80 or a buck 81 not too long ago.  So, yeah, it's moving.  But what's up, buddy?  Okay.  But thank you.  So, listen, so I've been married for about 10 years, and for the first three years, she 
[03:47:30]  would blow me all the time, and everything was fantastic.  And then all of a sudden, it just fucking ended.  And I don't understand what happened, and it seems to be a common thing with everyone  I fucking talk to.  Married people, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't understand.  Like, if we split up today, and she goes out to date someone, that's the first thing  she's going to do to kind of get them into the fold.  Did it happen after you had kids?  Um, you know, I probably stopped a little bit before the kids, but, uh, you know, she 
[03:48:00]  used to love it.  I mean, you know, she was a three-hole kind of person, no issues.  And that we do anal, we do it normally, but the blowjob's just non-existent.  Do you talk to her about what she's saying?  Oh, she gets defensive immediately, and I'm the fucking asshole for bringing it up.  Has your diet changed?  Maybe your cum is awful.  Oh, no, my cum has been awful the entire time.  That's good.  At least he's aware.  That's good. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  No, there's no question.  That just stinks, but you know what?  It stinks before.  Well, maybe you want to take something.  Here's the problem, sir.  I mean, do you love oral sex?  Yeah, I mean, I love giving it.  I love eating pussy.  What a perfect...  She doesn't even like, you know, she doesn't even like when I do that now.  She's like totally orally gone out of it.  This is a perfect call, though, because it's like you have to practically beg your wife, and  a lot of guys have to beg their wives, their girlfriends for a blowjob, and, you know, sometimes 
[03:49:00]  you find yourself counting down the days to your birthday or anniversary for that once  or twice a year special treat, when she'll finally open up her yap again and start sucking  your penis.  That's what you're going through, sir.  If this sounds familiar, and it certainly does, then don't waste another minute.  You need to get masked sexual flavors today, sir.  This is an in-show mention.  Mask sexual flavors.  They're flavored gel strips.  That's probably what happens.  She's probably tired of your awful coffee jism, and these things will dissolve on her tongue, 
[03:49:30]  and they block the taste of oral sex, including your orgasm.  Mask drastically improves the experience for both of you and your partner.  So what's happening is your wife won't have to hear you complaining, and you won't have  to hear her going, I don't want to say, because your cum is horrendous.  It's been featured on the pages of Playboy and Men's Health magazine.  Mask was developed through years of research, sir.  You think you're the only one going through this?  You think you're the only one?  I think old fucking old metal feet in South Africa just dealt with this, and he shot his 
[03:50:00]  wife through a door, or his girlfriend, whatever she is.  You don't need to go that far.  This mask is 100% safe and effective.  Visit sexualflavors.com to learn more.  You can read customer reviews and buy single strips or buy three packs.  Strawberry, watermelon, mango, and chocolate.  That's sexualflavors.com.  Here's what you ought to do, my friend.  Introduce this girl, your wife, to mask sexual flavors.  She'll be very glad that you did.  So I hope that works for you.  Well, I didn't realize you had that much stock in that company. 
[03:50:30]  You know what, sir?  They happen to be a sponsor.  I just was improv-ing that.  It just kind of came out naturally.  And it was an impressive segue.  I was very impressed with that.  Yeah, yeah.  It just kind of happened.  It's a professionalism.  Thank you.  Well done.  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Yeah, good luck, buddy.  I would just talk to you about it.  I don't know why that stops.  Married couples say that that stops a lot.  You hear it from everybody, even just people who have been dating for a couple years.  You hear it from everyone that the girl just craps out on the blowjobs.  I don't get that either.  I mean, it's like a cliche at this point, but yeah, it's...  You think it's anger built up?  Like, I wonder, because, like, resentment sometimes built up, and you don't want to do something 
[03:51:00]  for somebody that they like.  I mean...  I mean, I don't know, when you, like, smell someone's dump in your house, like, maybe  you don't want to blow them anymore.  Right.  Like, you're just too familiar with them.  Or, some girls might not have ever really enjoyed it.  They were just kind of getting you comfortable for a couple years.  Trying to rope you in.  Yeah, and then, yeah.  But I don't know.  It could just be...  I mean, when you're overly familiar with someone, you don't want your face in their crotch, necessarily.  Maybe you smell their log one too many times.  You're right.  You're right.  That fucking morning shit record.  Yes.  You rock. 
[03:51:30]  Who's next?  You want to take a comedy question?  Okay.  This is Cigars and Scotch.  Okay.  Hello, Cigars and Scotch.  Hey, what's going on, Jim?  Hi, buddy.  I have a question for you.  How do you get your foot in the door, like, and break into comedic writing?  Like, I know I'm funny.  I can do very quick, topical quips.  Kind of more suited for a monologue, but how do you get into it and get paid for it?  That's a good question.  I've never done that.  I could probably find out, like, how do you submit to Leno, Letterman, Conan, Kimmel?  They do take submissions.  I don't know what that process is.  I know some of them do take freelance, where you'll get, like, 75 to 100 jokes. 
[03:52:00]  It's usually frowned upon because it's outside the guild, but a lot of the shows do do it.  Right.  But I wouldn't even know where to send it to.  That's...  You know what?  Let me see if I can find out for you.  I really don't know the answer to that, and I'll see if I can do some investigating and find out for you.  Oh, dude.  I would appreciate that so much.  Okay.  I don't have an answer yet, but...  In 20 years, I'll probably kill myself still.  I'll try.  I'll try.  Sometime next week.  Let me see if I can find that for you, okay?  Oh, awesome.  All right, buddy.  Thanks, man.  Bye.  E-Rock, please remind me.  Will do. 
[03:52:30]  Brad in Buffalo has an escort question.  Oh, cool.  Hey, Jimmy.  You have a fantastic voice on the phone.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, so, yeah.  First, I want to say that you and Bailey J totally made me feel okay to admit to pretty much everybody that I love.  I don't want to offend anybody.  I love trannies.  And I want to make sense.  Good, good, good.  Yeah.  So, I want to ask you.  I have no problem sleeping with women, and I've done it a few times, but I want to ask you what your opinion is on where the best place to find an escort is. 
[03:53:00]  Why do you say that?  Are you ready to fly your biplane?  And you want to pick up.  I can hear that fucking noise in the back.  You strapping on your leather helmet and goggles.  The roads are covered in snow.  It's all shitty.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  What's your question again?  I'm sorry.  I was too busy joshing.  I'll pull over just for you, kitten.  My question is, where do you think the best place to find an escort is?  I've used Backpage.  Sure.  And I've heard some of the websites you use to look for reviews, but what would your opinion be? 
[03:53:30]  Theeroticreview.com is a good site for reviews.  Erosguide.com.  I've heard good things about Eros.  Yeah, I think that's the highest end one.  Yeah.  They can't have nude pictures.  Like, you can have tits, but you can't have, like, any pussies or anything like that.  It almost makes it hotter.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little hideaway.  Yeah.  It looks a little bit like regular people dressed.  Unless you have a specific vagina you want.  Like, in your case, which is just an exploded excuse for a vagina. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, I do.  I want to look at the top of a cave ceiling.  A nice roast beef sandwich.  Ugh.  Yeah, I love that.  It's not my thing.  It's not a lot of people's things.  Even a little tucked-in perfect gymnast vagina, I'm like, okay, I'll make that.  I can make that work.  But as soon as there's something going on there, I'm like, ugh.  A tucked-in one?  No, sorry.  I hate when it looks like a hotel pillow.  That's what I like, just neat and tidy.  That's what I like.  No, I don't at all.  I don't at all.  I want it to look like fucking, like a tsunami just blew through a room. 
[03:54:30]  So I would suggest Eros Guide or go to the Erotic Review and put it in your area and just  look.  I mean, you can get a good or bad experience off any site or in any town.  So again, there's no pat answer to that.  All right, Jim.  I thank you for your time.  And Bailey, I love you with all my heart.  Oh, that's awesome.  Well, thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  I also wanted to tell you, too, at the event last night, my wife noticed how much weight  you lost when you came out on stage.  And you were all dressed up in your suit.  And she said you looked like a little boy wearing daddy's clothes. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, I always do when I wear a suit.  I look like it shouldn't be happening.  There's something wrong.  I should either be getting buried or I'm wearing somebody else's clothes.  Who's next?  This is Chris in Tucson.  He has a stand-up question for you.  Okay.  Chris.  How are you doing?  Hi, Chris.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hey, I have a quick question.  Sure.  I've been working on writing bits and honing on some material.  Where I live is pretty conservative.  Do you think I should just go balls to the wall with it or do you think I should get my 
[03:55:30]  foot in the door first?  No, I think you should just be yourself.  I have views that lean very conservative and I have some views that lean very, very liberal.  I don't think you should try to define yourself like that.  When you're being funny, just be funny and be truthful.  Don't worry about being right or wrong.  Just be truthful.  Too many comedians get caught up trying to be right and then that makes them boring on stage.  If your entire act is one ideology, I'm bored by you. 
[03:56:00]  If every opinion you have, I can guess before you give it, you're a bore.  That's why I loved Carlin because he was a very liberal guy, but he would also attack liberals  and attack the paternalism and the ideology of being politically correct.  So never be afraid to just be who you are on stage, man.  If it happens to be conservative, well, that's what it is.  But don't try to write differently.  Just write truthfully.  Hey, thanks, man. 
[03:56:30]  Good luck.  Can we get some WoW stickers?  Yeah, I may not hold and Sal can help you.  All right, thanks, dude.  All right, man.  Pete from Long Island has a question about sobriety.  Okay.  Hi, Jimmy.  What's going on?  Hi, Pete.  All right, first off, last night was fucking epic.  Really sick.  Thanks for coming.  No problem.  Happy to give to the cause.  But my question was sobriety.  I'm only 23, but went through kind of like a rough patch. 
[03:57:00]  You got it out of the way young and everything.  And my whole thing was like the opiate spectrum of stuff.  I'm on like a shot now helping out, but I'm just worried to get off of that.  You know, like none of the friends I'm around, like just totally switched crowds and everything.  Not with them.  Going to like my self-help meetings and all that type of stuff.  But just like I'm worried about the people, places, and things when you get out, I'm done with the shot.  You know, like right now it's preventing, the shot prevents you from like getting high or having cravings or anything like that. 
[03:57:30]  But I like when that security blanket goes away.  You'll do it without the shot.  You'll be okay without it.  Most people don't have the shot.  It's a good little temporary thing.  But you don't want that.  Don't be convinced that the only reason, because there are people that have drunk on antibodies.  There's people that have done that many times.  I mean, when you look at, don't think that that's what's really stopping you.  It's preventing you for now a little bit, but you could still do it if you wanted to.  And when you're off the shot, if you want to stay sober, you will. 
[03:58:00]  All right.  Thank you.  I'll see you at Caroline's in April.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot I'm working.  Yes.  In April, I'll be in Caroline's.  Thanks, buddy.  There's my plug.  I appreciate it because I'm not doing it.  No problem.  Have a good day, man.  All right.  Do you drink?  I do.  I used to drink more.  When we first met, when I did Bobby's show.  Right.  I was drinking more then, but I don't drink as much now.  Well, just because I'm married, so I don't know.  Weren't you married then?  Yeah, but I was just married.  I'm just getting in the habit of.  You look a lot thinner, too, by the way.  I lost like 30 pounds.  Wow. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  I just realized in that dress, it's a very slinky.  You guys can't see Bailey J.  She's wearing a very, very slinky.  I'm just like a whore for the radio because I'm married.  Yeah, but it's a great look.  I was like, oh, my God.  You lost a lot of it.  Yeah, my tits are fake, so they're the same size.  So now I'm a 30 double D, which is pretty ridiculous.  Like, not even a real bra size.  Are you double D?  Oh, my God.  I'm a 30 double D.  I have a small back, so it's a 30, which is even more insane.  That is very large.  Yeah.  You're a very chesty gal.  Well, thank you.  I'll Twitter a picture of Bailey J. 
[03:59:00]  Who's next, T-Rock?  Let's go to Rod in North Dakota.  He wants to talk to Bailey J.  Okay.  I like that name.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hi there, Rod.  Hey, how's it going?  I wanted to ask you, Bailey, about your voice.  Has this always been your voice?  Or, I mean, I'm a very audible type of guy when it comes to women's voice.  Uh-huh.  And yours is very attractive, so I was just kind of curious.  I actually, yeah.  I, um, this is the deepest my voice has ever been my whole life, and it used to be freaking 
[03:59:30]  terrible when I was attempting to pass as a little boy, and everybody just thought I  was a girl.  It was the worst.  Everybody just thought I was like a little chubby Chinese chick with a bowl cut.  Like, nobody, nobody thought that I was a boy.  And so it's not like I went from being a full-fledged man to, you know, living my life as a woman.  And I went from perpetually being a nine-year-old boy with a little girl's voice to being a  porn star woman. 
[04:00:00]  It was, like, really ridiculous.  But, yeah, so it, um, is, yeah, my voice was always like this, nasally, and, and it  used to be squeakier.  You got very lucky with the voice.  I did.  I know girls that are even luckier than me, where you're just like, what the hell?  Like, why is your voice so amazing?  And then there's some girls who, it sucks, and, you know, they get surgery.  Yeah, they just, oh, do they really?  Yeah, they, they do a surgery, um, a throat doctor, like, somebody does surgery on, like,  opera singers and stuff.  They, they basically tighten the vocal cords.  But more times than not, it leaves these girls sounding like they're whispering forever. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  And so it's, like, really creepy.  I just wanted you to know.  What is your Twitter, by the way?  You, I, I've, I've, I've, I've, I do not remember.  Matt runs the Twitter.  Bailey, at Bailey J Show.  Okay, B-A-I.  I'm Twittering a picture of Bailey right now for you.  B-A-I, Bailey J Show.  Okay.  Yeah, Matt runs it, because I got tired of seeing all the foreign penis.  That was not great.  Uh, okay, yes, who's next, Yrog?  Uh, let's go to, let's see right here. 
[04:01:00]  Tom in Boston has a, a thing with an escort.  Okay.  James, good morning.  Hi, buddy.  Bailey, you are stunningly beautiful.  Thank you very much.  So, I got a problem, Jim.  Yes.  Last night, on a total spur, I contacted an escort off of Craigslist.  Never done it before.  Don't even know why I did it.  Uh, you know, I'm, like, 30.  She, she's 22. 
[04:01:30]  Met up with her about 9 o'clock.  Had sex.  Ended up talking with her.  Ended up spending the night.  She wants to go out on a regular date with me now.  She's been texting me all morning.  You know, trying to, like, be almost girlfriend-ish.  Did you like her?  Dude, she was stunning.  Wow.  I've been dying for, I've been dying.  You just, you just, this is my dream come true.  I was going to say, it sounds amazing.  Now, how much, how much did she want when you first called her?  How much did she want? 
[04:02:00]  A buck fifty.  How much did you pay her at the end of the next morning?  I gave her the buck fifty the minute I walked in the door.  Oh, she didn't ask for anything extra?  Nope.  I handed it to her when I walked in.  Well, why don't you just take her out to Ethan?  What's wrong with that?  Well, today she had some stuff to do, and I have, you know, I'm at my job right now,  and, you know, she wants to cook this weekend.  And it's just, I mean, she's very cool, and I'm kind of perplexed as to what to do. 
[04:02:30]  I mean, she, she doesn't do this too often, but she's done it probably five or six times  in the last year.  Look, maybe she does, maybe she doesn't.  Be very, very wary of any escort, because they're experts on picking up on things that  they can capitalize on, not because they're vultures, but because they're smart, and  that's their business.  Right, right.  But also, she may just genuinely like you.  There's also that, too, where maybe she's being totally truthful.  Well, she is young.  She's 22.  I mean, there's a good chance that, obviously, she hasn't been doing this too long. 
[04:03:00]  I mean, let's hope she's 22.  Right.  So, 10 years, anything more than 10 years is creepy.  But, yeah, maybe she's just like you.  Yeah, I mean, she started doing it last summer on kind of a dare with one of her friends.  I guess one of her female friends does it a little bit more and wanted her to go with  her female friend to have, like, a threesome, and she went.  Oh, okay.  I would take her out.  I think you should take her out.  It's a pretty woman.  Yeah, exactly. 
[04:03:30]  Exactly.  I would take her out, yeah.  Take her, yeah, and then pick her up in your arms and carry her to a limb after Jason  Alexander, case fucks her at a horse party.  The worst part is, I'm in law enforcement, and, you know, I kind of alluded to that.  You know what?  I'm in law enforcement.  Okay, well, okay, you're in law enforcement, so, okay.  So, I don't know how that, I mean, I kind of hinted at that, but I'm not sure if you  picked up on it.  I wouldn't even worry about that.  Once she likes you, if you go out a bunch of times, she won't care what you do for a 
[04:04:00]  living.  Right.  And, I mean, you have already had sex with her, so.  Yeah, you already paid her and fucked her.  It's not like you're going to be like, gotcha.  Yeah.  I'll send her your picture, her picture.  Yeah, please do.  I'll email it to you.  Yes, the real Jim Norton at Gmail.  Send me her ad, too.  I think I like this girl.  Take care, brother.  Maybe I'll bring her to one of your Boston shows.  Yeah, I'll be there the 29th of March, so bring her.  Bring Bailey with you, will ya?  I totally should go.  Yes, you should go to Boston.  Thank you, Jim.  Yeah, I do great in Boston.  You do, right?  You think?  Oh, have you?  I don't know. 
[04:04:30]  I guess I'm still white, so people would be nice to me in Boston.  Oh, yeah, they would.  I'll do the other one at the end.  We got time.  Okay.  Who's next?  Clinton, Illinois, wants to talk wife swapping.  Okay.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, Clinton.  Okay.  I'm actually the guy.  I emailed you a while back about fucking my cousin.  I don't know if you remember that.  I do not.  Did I fuck your cousin?  You wanted to?  About me fucking my own cousin.  Oh, okay.  Sorry. 
[04:05:00]  We exchanged some emails.  Okay.  But I'm in the midst of a pretty heavy sexual addiction, and I've drug my wife in, too, and  everything's great.  I mean, we're all over each other all the time.  Okay.  The last 90 days, we've probably screwed 85 days.  Oh, okay.  Um, I've started bringing a friend in.  Guy or girl?  Guy.  Okay.  And I'm totally into it.  I love, I love the three-way. 
[04:05:30]  I love just watching.  Sure.  But my question for you is, I know how hot it is for her, and I know she really would  like to fuck this guy without me there.  He's a good, good friend.  I totally trust both of them, but I'm still just a little hung up on it.  Now, how do you know she wants to fuck him without you there?  Because we've talked about it.  And what did she say?  She said she would like to fuck him when I wasn't there, if I was cool with it.  What's her reasoning for that? 
[04:06:00]  Uh, just, I think, mainly, uh, comfort level.  Uh, it's awkward a little bit, the three of us.  Uh, and she's attractive to him.  That's rough.  Yeah, that's a little, you gotta be careful of that one.  Mm-hmm.  I'm not saying don't do it.  My ex and I would talk, well, actually, my three exes ago would talk dirty, and I would  fuck her and talk about the guys.  And, and, and the turn-on for me was her telling me she wanted to fuck them when I wasn't around.  Okay.  Because there was a humiliation with that, but the reality is I would not have wanted 
[04:06:30]  her to do it.  Um, how do you really feel about it?  I, a week ago, uh, I let her blow in without me being there.  I was in the same house.  Oh, okay.  I just let them go back to the bedroom, and, and I was 100% fine with it.  And I love hearing exactly, my, where I get off is when we're together, and she's telling  me exactly what happened. 
[04:07:00]  Is he better looking than you?  Does he have a bigger dick than you?  No.  Okay.  Oh, well then, I mean, then that's kind of good.  And my wife and I have been together 20 years, and he's been my friend for 20 years, so.  So I couldn't do that with the friend.  That might have meant she's had a thing for him a long time, though.  You gotta be careful with friends.  Right.  Like, she may want to be intimate with him.  Like, she may want to kiss him and, and touch his face and look into his eyes while he fucks  her.  Which is way more fucked up.  Way more fucked up.  Because that's intimate and personal.  That's different than just being dirty. 
[04:07:30]  If she's known him for all these years, they may have had underlying vibes.  Right.  It sounds like a bad idea.  I'm just gonna say it.  Yeah.  It sounds like a bad idea.  Like, because if she specifically doesn't want you there, it sounds like she wants to be,  I feel like things could get romantic.  Yeah.  Which is bad.  Beyond, beyond just being cuckolding and dirty, um, knowing him for that long and wanting  to be alone with him is, I think, dangerous.  And you should be really careful of that one.  Or you may wind up losing her to him. 
[04:08:00]  Okay.  All right.  Hey, thanks, Jimmy.  Good luck, brother.  Bailey.  Oh, bye-bye.  I'm a big fan.  Aw, thank you very much.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Take one more call?  Come on, let's do a quick one.  We got 30 seconds.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  You have to read this?  You got to do that.  I have to read this.  Not that I don't want to.  They're actually good sponsors.  We have to do two an hour here.  Your razor does not need a vibrating handle, a back scratcher, and 10 blades.  Seriously.  Have you noticed the price you pay for a new razor? 
[04:08:30]  It's ridiculous.  It's how much?  Is that in pay?  Oh, I see.  I'm not right.  I'm a terrible actor.  Sorry.  It's how much?  Is that in pesos?  And you're doing this every month for the rest of your life?  This is your Dollar Shave Club moment.  And it's time to join all the Opie and Anthony listeners who've discovered dollarshaveclub.com.  Listen.  Here's what all the buzz is about.  It's like found money.  All us guys want us a great shave without shelling out 20 bucks month after month. 
[04:09:00]  I'm really butchering this read because I've never actually read through it because Opie and Anthony normally do this one.  And in all honesty, they both love this.  Opie made fun of it at first, and now he's like, these fucking razors are great.  So this is something that the people who have experienced it like it.  I'm trying to get one myself, but I think we're all into it.  It would take a little while, but they're going to.  Because Dollar Shave Club is genius.  You'd be an idiot not to do this.  You send them a couple bucks a month, and they deliver amazing quality razor blades right to your door.  You save a fortune. 
[04:09:30]  Plus, you always have fresh blades on hand.  No more zombying your face with old blades just because you can't afford or forgot to buy new ones.  There's nothing worse than when you just see that stupid rusty blade in the morning, and you're like, ugh, I don't want to go to the pharmacy right now because your wife has to come in and take a dump.  And by the time you go to the pharmacy, she'll shit while you're gone, and then you'll have to shave and her stink.  Join the rest of the Opie and Anthony listeners and get a great shave and keep your cash at dollarshave.com.  Dollarshave.com, dollarshaveclub.com. 
[04:10:00]  I've been saying it wrong.  Dollar Shave is not it.  It's dollarshaveclub.com.  My apology to dollarshaveclub.com.  I said dollarshaveclub, and that's correct.  I said it wrong before that.  I'm fucking tired.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We have to go.  Dollarshaveclub.com.  They're very good.  And Bailey, thank you very much.  You promoting anything?  Everything.  ts-baileyj.com is my porn site.  You can go there and pay money to watch me jerk off and stuff. 
[04:10:30]  Bailey is fantastic, and hopefully she'll make many more appearances on this show.  Yes, I love it here.  Yes, we love you coming in.  And thank you guys very much.  And remember, tomorrow, my tickets for my one-hour special go on sale.  Tomorrow morning, I'm shooting in Boston, March 29th.  Thank you.  You're rocking.  Thanks, Bailey.  Thank you.  Bye.  Jim Norton is now done dealing with your bullshit. </pre>
