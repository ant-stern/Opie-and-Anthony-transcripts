<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and James Norton in studio.  William Donahue, president of the Catholic League, surprisingly offered positive comments about their comeback.  The hosts then immediately devolved into their characteristically crude and offensive humor, directing insults at themselves, their crew (Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, E-Roc, and others), and Kenny, Opie's OCD-afflicted personal assistant.  A significant portion detailed Kenny's rigidly punctual morning routine and the anxiety caused when a flat tire delayed Opie's pickup. This segued into a discussion of changing tires and modern car design challenges.  Norton then graphically recounted a sexually explicit experience at a massage parlor, filled with vulgar jokes and suggestive comments.

The show also covered news items including Paul McCartney's marital problems with Heather Mills (with extensive, crude jokes about her leg and their relationship), Britney Spears, and a runaway bride.  They heavily criticized and satirized Tyra Banks' prison experience TV special, playing clips and mocking its superficiality.  This segment also featured Twitchels and Big A, being filmed for an MTV "True Life" episode on Tourette's Syndrome, with their comedic, often interrupted, news report interspersed with jokes about Twitchels’ tics and Almond Joy consumption.  Their "News" segment covered President Bush’s border visit, the Duke lacrosse case, Heather Mills and Paul McCartney's separation, and a Christie's Star Trek auction.  The latter half included a discussion of a "Happy Typing Girls" sleepover and Stalker Patty, a comically mangled version of Lou Gehrig's farewell speech by Big A, and discussion of the show's censored segments ("dumps").  They also teased upcoming segments including a "Tyra Pranked" segment,  a "Jimmy Day" segment involving a prank call from Jimmy Norton's mother, and a planned interview with Taylor Hicks (non-studio). A listener call further fueled the comedic chaos.

The show also discussed their upcoming appearance on Hannity & Colmes and a rival radio host's "mousetrap" stunt involving a female intern.  A lengthy segment played audio clips from "Teenage Tourette's Camp," featuring teenagers with Tourette's exhibiting various tics, provoking further offensive commentary from the hosts. This was interspersed with calls, including one from a woman mistakenly calling the wrong show, leading to vulgar questioning, and other callers describing intrusive thoughts and a wife's negative reaction to the show's language.  The discussion included British comedian Lee Evans, who was a guest later in the broadcast.

Lee Evans, when he appeared in-studio, discussed his stage fright, career anecdotes (including early punk band experiences and working with Richard Dreyfuss), and observations about UK vs. US culture (police, emergency services, attitudes towards nudity, and language).  The hosts, Evans, and callers discussed the World Cup, the Euro, British slang, and soccer's popularity in America.  A business conversation with Fareed concluded with the announcement of six new broadcast areas for the show, all laced with the show’s usual humor and insults.  Finally, the show ended with a voicemail from Jimmy Norton's mother suggesting he replace his "ladies of the evening" with exercise.  The broadcast throughout featured extensive use of highly offensive language and sexually explicit content.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue, president of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounced back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people. You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well. I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well. 
[00:00:30]  Push the button! Push the button! Push the button!  Can you hear me? No! Shut up!  Me and Anthony! We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards. Wow! We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news. We're perverts. Stupid.  We stink. We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie. I love the hitting and the fighting. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  We care like...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Roc!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No!  What's wrong, Aaron? 
[00:01:30]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax. Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I love you, Johnny Cakes. I love you, Johnny Cakes.  He's a fag.  Ow! 
[00:02:00]  Hi!  Good morning!  Good morning!  Good morning!  Good morning!  It's Friday!  It's Friday!  It's Friday!  This is the Opian Anthony Show.  The one virus spreading across America.  The phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Good morning, Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  Good morning, Opian...  Whoa, Jimmy.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hiya, man.  Jimmy's in a bad mood, so we're gonna be, uh...  I know.  ...overly excited and happy to try to get him out of his funk.  He wasn't as friendly this morning when he came in.  I said, hi, Jimmy.  And he said, go F yourself.  He went...  Grr.  Grr.  He growled.  Grr.  Yeah, he's disgusted.  It's just a weird day.  It's raining in New York.  Yeah, we had one good day. 
[00:03:00]  That's nice.  Club Soda Kenny got a flat tire on the way to work today.  I threw off everyone's schedule because he's becoming like a personal assistant or something.  I didn't know what to do with myself because Kenny's been picking me up at home, especially  with the rain and stuff.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, he didn't show up when he was supposed to, and I...  Uh-oh.  Did you get worried?  I, uh...  I just sat on the couch like, oh, no, what am I supposed to do?  You just don't know what to do after you get used to doing things a certain way.  All of a sudden, it's like I have Down syndrome, and I'm just waiting for my parents to help 
[00:03:30]  me out.  I didn't know what to do.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm like, uh, uh, uh, who do you call?  Where do you go?  Do you just go outside?  It's raining.  Try to get a cab in the rain.  Or wait for Kenny.  So I got a cab in the rain.  I got a flat tire.  But I'm stupid because Club Soda Kenny has OCD.  I mean, we're going to get into this little bit someday.  I didn't know that, by the way.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:00]  It finally hit me on the Boston trip, and he has to be at my place at 4.55 every morning.  Exactly.  Even though his email says, I'll pick you up at 5, and he has to write that email every  night at 9.55 p.m.  Do you really?  Dude, it's ridiculous.  It's gotten to the point where I see 4.55 on my clocks or whatever at home, and there  goes the buzzer.  I'm like, of course. 
[00:04:30]  You just know.  And I just know he's just waiting outside the apartment with his freaking watch.  Oh, it's 4.55, and then bam.  Every morning.  Not, it hasn't been 4.54.  It hasn't been 4.56.  Same Kenny time.  Same Kenny station.  I'm a loyal and faithful companion.  Very prompt.  Very predictable.  You are a freak like the rest of us.  He is completely OCD.  See, I brought OCD to this show, and I realized that I'm not as bad as, like, some of the 
[00:05:00]  other people around here.  I'm punctual.  No, 4.50.  To the point, I one morning just yelled at him.  I'm like, dude, stop with the 4.55.  Mix it up a minute or two.  Be late.  Who cares?  Be there at 5.01.  It's not like we come here to show prep.  You ever read his emails about, like, his itineraries were awful?  Last time we went, where did we go?  Chicago, Chicago.  Chicago, the itinerary I get in the email, he goes, Ken picks up Jim. 
[00:05:30]  He's writing as another person.  He called himself Ken, like this was the hip, relaxed Kenny for the weekend.  Ken.  And he goes, one of the instructors picks Jim up at a certain time, goes to Newark Airport,  park car, get up.  Like, thank God you wrote that down.  Otherwise, we would have left it running in front of the...  I don't know how he kept this from us for so long.  Because I finally noticed in Boston when Lindsay and I went to his room, because we were all  going out to dinner, and it looked like he wasn't even sleeping in the room.  I'm like, did you change rooms or something? 
[00:06:00]  And he doesn't even allow them to clean the room.  What do you do?  Well, I'm neat.  Oh, so do you unpack and everything?  Anthony, let me explain.  I walked into his room.  This was after the third day in Boston.  We had to be up there for a while just to do one show, which was whatever.  So I walk in, right?  The bed, perfectly, I mean, perfectly made.  He makes it himself.  But the covers pulled back on a triangle.  Not a hint that there's a piece of clothing in the room, because it's all in drawers and in the closets. 
[00:06:30]  And then just a laptop on the desk.  That is it.  That's it.  That is it.  I like to live large.  It's better to be made so neat, you have to bounce a dollar bill off it.  My hotel rooms wind up looking like the Who circa 1975 were in there.  Exactly.  It's just a mess.  There's like three different room service trays that they tell me to bring down.  Make sure you call up when you are done, and we will remove the tray.  It sounds like it's a convenience for you, but it's so they have more trays. 
[00:07:00]  And I just keep calling and more.  I had to get a hold of you.  I listened to four messages and two text messages, all saying exactly the same thing, that he's not going to be able to pick me up at 455 because he got a flat tire.  Why not just leave the message once?  I needed to hear your voice, some reassurance.  I was stuck on the New Jersey Turnpike in the darkness, in the rain, with sharks going by 80 miles an hour. 
[00:07:30]  I needed a little TLC.  Or how about being responsible and getting up and allowing for the possibility there might be flat tires instead of sloughing off?  Good point, Jimmy.  Good point.  You're right.  You changed the tire yourself?  No, I called roadside assistance.  And they assisted.  Yeah, because it was raining, you know.  And then he runs in.  Is everybody okay?  I'm sorry.  I couldn't be here. 
[00:08:00]  Does anyone change their tire anymore?  Is that what people do?  Unless you have an older car.  The last time I changed a tire was with the old jack.  Now I couldn't tell you where my jack is, how it works, where the spare is, because they hide it on the cars now.  So you don't even know where it is.  Well, I couldn't get it out.  I thought about changing it.  Yeah.  And I found where it was.  I attempted to get it out, and I couldn't.  And then I remembered I had roadside assistance. 
[00:08:30]  That's why they put them like that.  So you have to get roadside assistance.  Could you see a poor woman out there, or Kenny, trying to change the tire?  Like some guys, if you man up, you know, I guess you could change your friggin' tire.  It can't be that hard.  Well, I had to change one on the road once with little Jimmy.  Oh, that must have been a treat.  I was sweating.  I was filthy.  I'll say.  Did you help at all, Jimmy?  Yeah, I made sure that there was no one bothering us.  Yeah.  I handed him tools.  I was like his four-year-old son. 
[00:09:00]  Did you knock the lug nuts into the sewer grating?  And then say the F-word and get in trouble by your dad?  I did nothing but watch a man do a man's task.  He's great at giving encouragement.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're doing good.  Twist the lug nut.  Well, welcome to it.  He had problems twisting the lug nuts.  I never would have gotten it.  He had trouble.  Yeah, the big moose.  Yeah, they were on.  You know, because the servicemen, they use that air gun.  Yeah.  They put them on way too tight on purpose.  You think? 
[00:09:30]  That's how they get you.  That's a campaign cry.  Yeah, I know.  The new lug wrenches stink in cars.  It's that offset little piece of tin.  You need that big X1 that's big.  Get a lot of leverage on that thing.  Get a foot on it and a hand.  But they're too big to fit in these little compartments that they put in the newer cars.  You need the hooker killer.  The old hooker killer.  The old hooker killer.  We came out to the garage to go to the...  It was from one gig to another and the tire was flat. 
[00:10:00]  And I'm like, ugh.  So Kenny's like, just trying to get the lug nuts off.  And the whole time I'm just trying to talk.  Because there's something embarrassing when a man is changing your tire and you're 37.  Yeah.  You should be able to do it yourself.  And you're just being a woman standing there.  And we both knew that he was helping me because he was working with me.  But it wasn't that.  It was we both knew that I couldn't do it.  Yeah.  It's sad.  At least the newer cars or most of them have now full-size spares that you can drive around on. 
[00:10:30]  Because we went through the donut years for a while.  Where it was just that thing, that rim with some rubber on it that said,  do not exceed like 15 miles per hour for more than 10 minutes on this tire.  Jimmy had a donut on the Saturn.  Oh, the Saturn has a donut.  We had to drive like four hours.  Did Jimmy eat it and then feel bad about himself?  There you go.  Thank you, Mr. Imus.  Sorry to interrupt everybody.  But behind Anthony's head is a huge flat screen TV. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And Imus broadcasts his show on MSNBC.  And one of our pals is on there.  And he's wearing an Opie and Anthony spread the virus t-shirt this morning.  Rob Bartlett doing his Brian Wilson impression.  And he likes to wear an Opie and Anthony t-shirt when he does that.  So, very good.  All right, Kenny.  Well, thanks.  Good day to everyone.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning, club starter Kenny.  All right.  We're going to take our first break so we can maybe stay on schedule today.  Stay on schedule.  Because we really screwed that up yesterday. 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  Paul McCartney's sick and tired of wife's constant nagging.  We'll get into that.  Can you believe it?  I thought it was all a joke that she was the one ragging him.  He's the Beatle.  We'll get into it.  We'll get into that.  Also, happy anniversary to Anthony.  Oh, wow.  It's a big day in Anthony's life.  I forgot.  We'll get into that.  Again.  Britney Spears nearly drops kid.  That's on the front page of the paper today.  Front page again. 
[00:12:00]  Fiance dumps runaway bride.  We'll get into that today.  They're trying to dig up Jimmy Hoffa in Michigan.  Uh, uh, the subway series in New York starts today.  Uh, uh, oh, Tyra in prison.  That is got to be the highlight of the day.  And I cannot wait to hear it.  Old cigarette ads versus new cigarette ads.  And Big A and Twitchell's doing the news.  We wanted to rest a bit.  Rest it?  Wanted to throw them out a window.  But stupid Twitchell's, I'm starting to think he's a smart, uh, a smart one. 
[00:12:30]  He got MTV involved.  So the MTV's coming to, uh, film Twitchell's for True Life.  So we're like, ah, we gotta do the bit again.  We gotta do the bit again.  So they film it for MTV.  So we're gonna do that as well today.  Okay.  Here's how they'll word it up.  He comes onto a popular radio show.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure.  And then they'll blur everything out.  I'm sure.  That has anything to do with us.  Nothing worse than TV shows that show radio stations.  They're all like, they did it for American Idol.  And it's the same show every time.  Hey, we got, uh, we got, uh, Taylor Hicks coming in today. 
[00:13:00]  But they're bad radio voices.  It's the same show.  Every time I see that on TV, I roll my eyes.  I'm like, oh my God, these guys are just making us look bad.  Here it is.  But then again, the American Idol, uh, contestants are only going on the wimpy shows.  Because we wanted the American Idol, uh, throw-offs.  And they, for some reason, they won't give them to us.  We got one.  Didn't we?  Uh, we got Ace.  Oh, we got Ace Young.  We got Ace.  Did you?  Not in the studio.  We got a phone call.  So what happened?  Maybe we didn't treat him right? 
[00:13:30]  No.  It went very well.  I let my sister interview him.  So why didn't we get anyone else?  Instead, we have to watch on TV this past, uh, what day was it?  Tuesday.  Elliot and, uh, Taylor Hicks going to these just hacky radio shows.  Yeah, let's break it back.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Wow, look at that.  There's that big head of gray hair.  Watch us sit down.  Shut up.  All right.  Well, when we get back, Jimmy is in a bad mood and he's going to tell us why. 
[00:14:00]  Funk.  You're in a funk.  He's a little tired.  I'm cranky.  He's cranky.  He's going to tell us why right after the break, okay?  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yep.  Okay.  92.3, free FM.  If you have anything for the show today, 1-866-313-FREE.  Write that down.  1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:14:30]  Feeling better, Jimmy?  You got your coffee.  You got your cereal.  Yeah, I finally ate a little bit.  I feel better.  I just did a cereal.  I feel like three hours of sleep.  I'm very damn tired.  Jimmy's a little tired.  Like, I'm sleepy.  I was at the cellar and I went dropping stupid Bob Kelly off.  I would talk about massage places.  And he goes, yeah, this place I used to go to a long time ago.  So I'm like, yeah, why don't you show me where it is?  Uh-oh.  And he can't remember where it is because it's been years since he's been there. 
[00:15:00]  But he's like, ah, I think it was that block.  So we go down.  He goes, that's not here anymore.  I go, all right, I better go home.  He goes, ah, let's go around the block again.  I'm like, no, because if we go around the block again, I'm stopping.  He goes, let's just look.  So, of course, we see it.  I'm parking.  And I walk up from the door.  I walk down the steps.  And the way they do it at this place is it's a really big place.  And the lady goes, hi, first time.  I go, yeah.  And she goes, okay.  And then there's two other Asian girls dressed in white.  It was like they were clockwork orange.  All white pants and white T-shirts. 
[00:15:30]  Walk you to the back into a locker room.  You get into a locker.  Put all your clothes in.  You're naked.  And I know there's a few guys walking around.  And usually in these places, it's kind of you don't see the other customers.  Right.  On the QT.  It's kind of on the DL.  Right.  But I see other guys mingling in the locker room.  So I put like this little paper-thin towel.  I walk through a glass door.  I see a line of seven guys waiting to walk through this other door.  Uh-oh.  So I go, what is this?  They go, that's the line for the washdown.  I'm like, all right. 
[00:16:00]  So I'm standing in line in a towel.  Washdown?  Seven other men.  What's the washdown?  Well, they wash you down.  It was just awful.  I'm there with these guys.  And we're all trying to make small talk as we're in towels.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Waiting to have people who just got off a slave ship service us for $80.  I just stepped out of a cargo container.  And what happened was there was a door that was closed in front of us.  And somebody would go in.  And you'd hear like this water getting sloshed around. 
[00:16:30]  And then you'd hear the door go like, like suction from another door that you couldn't see had opened.  It's just kind of scary.  It's kind of like if you're in a room with two doors.  You open one.  The suction will pull the other one closed a little more.  So that was the sign that it was someone else's turn coming up.  Oh.  25 minutes I'm in this line with a bunch of men in towels.  I get into this little room.  There's a big piece of rubber.  On like a, it looks like a doctor's office.  Again, not a good sign.  No.  And it's wet.  And there's a big, big tub of water. 
[00:17:00]  And with a bucket in it.  With a bucket in it.  Where is this?  Saigon?  You get face first on this awful, I thought of you the whole time.  Because it was like this was the same piece of rubber every other naked man had been laying on.  Oh, walk away.  And there's water on it, of course.  So I lay on it on my stomach.  And she just puts soap on you and she throws buckets of warm water on you.  Like you're an animal.  A car wash.  It was like a car wash.  It was a brushless car wash.  And then you think it's going to be sexy and saucy. 
[00:17:30]  She's going to loop for you.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Just like a quick one.  It really is just like a clean up.  And then you get your robe on.  They give you a thin robe.  But they want to make sure you don't have anything?  They just want to make sure you're clean for the massage.  Yeah.  And they put an awful robe on you.  You take your big locker key.  Then you go back to the other door.  Not as awful as the robe you're going to have to wear in a few years.  You walk through the other door.  Two more people.  It's very brave.  It's like an assembly line.  They run it well.  Two other girls come and grab you and go, okay, TV lounge. 
[00:18:00]  TV lounge.  There's so many guys here.  There's not enough tables.  We all have to wait in a TV lounge.  At one point, there were 11 of us at midnight waiting in a TV lounge.  Do you make eye contact?  It was so awful.  We all had to laugh.  None of us could believe we just came here for a little relaxation.  What type of guy is in here?  Just regular guys.  Does it run the gamut?  Yeah.  Yeah?  The only thing I'll say is you felt kind of comfortable because the place was clean  and you felt like no one was going to steal your stuff because it was run like a real establishment. 
[00:18:30]  So there's 11 of us in this little room watching the Phoenix Suns game.  And I finally just blurted out.  I'm like, this place is awful.  I'm like, it's just a bunch of men watching TV.  Everybody chuckled.  And one guy goes, yeah, in robes.  We all had like a laugh over that.  And then we realized this is not funny.  Nervous laugh.  It's midnight.  I have to get up at five.  All I want to do is get a handy.  I want to just be relaxed and go home.  Right.  So I guess 20 minutes later, it's finally like the lady would come in and go next.  And then whoever had been next would go with the girl. 
[00:19:00]  And she'd introduce you to your massage girl.  They all look exactly alike.  And I know that's like stereotypical.  Every one of these chicks is dressed exactly alike.  They're all wearing white.  They all have straight black hair.  It's almost like they don't want you to be able to identify them.  Be able to identify them.  Right.  Like if you're a cop.  Yeah, exactly.  It was a girl in white with the straight black hair.  Exactly.  I believe she was Asian.  So I've.  That's no expression.  No expression.  They round up every Asian in the city.  I couldn't tell if she was happy or if the building was on fire. 
[00:19:30]  So it's finally my turn.  And she goes next.  So I walk out.  And then some guy in his suit is walking down the hall.  And she goes, oh, okay.  And then she hustles me back into the room with the other guy.  Why?  I don't know.  You're done.  I guess I'm a regular customer.  So they're all laughing at me when I walk back in.  I was so embarrassed.  They're like, what happened?  And I'm like, I don't know.  And I have to sit back down.  And then she's like, next.  And then.  Do you ever get recognized in these situations?  I don't know if I did or not.  No one said anything.  I have in the past.  It's Lil Jimmy. 
[00:20:00]  It's no secret.  I mean, you openly talk about this stuff.  But it must be a little weird if you get recognized in that situation.  As you're sitting in a TV lounge with other guys.  Hey, aren't you the guy from HBO?  Well, I needed a real massage.  I mean, I worked out yesterday.  I mean, I was really sore.  I wanted.  Well, this place obviously has a reputation if they have so many people on there at midnight on a Thursday night.  The one guy's going, I had an appointment.  Did you?  Stupid.  An appointment.  It's not a doctor's office.  People are not licensed.  They've only learned to do it because they've been forced to do it since they were five. 
[00:20:30]  They're miserable.  Don't you love it?  So it's finally my turn.  And they introduced me to my girl.  And she's cute, I think, compared to the other girls.  I wouldn't know.  I think I tinkled.  I said, I have to pee.  I'm like, wait here.  Because I wanted her.  And I came out.  And it was a different girl.  And I only noticed because the face was kind of more oval.  A little different.  But you couldn't really tell.  Who cared?  Aren't you the...  Ah, does it matter?  She takes my hand.  Walks me up the steps. 
[00:21:00]  Into like a very clean massage room.  And she goes, I'm Angela.  Sure you are.  Are you?  Angela.  I get naked.  And I lay on the massage table.  And I got to say, it was a very...  It was well worth the wait.  A sexy...  Four-star review?  No, but not one star like originally.  The thing I liked about it is a lot of times in massage places, you go for an hour.  They rub your back for a while.  And then they finally...  You do the flip after 50 minutes.  You know. 
[00:21:30]  And then let's be honest.  If that's what you really came for.  Right.  They don't do anything sexy.  But do you enjoy the 50 minutes?  Not normally, no.  It's like...  So you're just sitting there waiting and waiting?  As they're trying to...  You've got to wait almost an hour for the payoff.  Here's what it is.  It's like they're trying to just convince themselves that they're not hooking.  I'm really doing massage therapy.  I'm really working out the kinks.  Yeah.  Where's your diploma on the wall?  I don't see any graduate of...  There's other stuff on the wall.  It ain't a diploma.  So when you go to a place where the whole thing took 10 minutes, let's say. 
[00:22:00]  Ah, you want a little bit of vibe.  There's a little something to it too, which can be very sexy.  But this one, you knew what you were there for.  But this girl is great because when they lay you on your stomach, she's standing at my head,  on my stomach, my face to the table.  And she puts a little cream on my back, a really good massage cream.  And she's rubbing from my shoulders, leaning over all the way down my spine to your butt cheeks  and then down to your thighs.  She's keeping it interesting the whole time.  Right.  While giving you a regular massage.  Like every few minutes, she's back down on the thighs. 
[00:22:30]  Tickle, tickle, tickle.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  That's the beautiful thing.  You know, right between the butt cheeks.  It's like a regular massage, but it's a little sexy.  And it was, you know, from your shoulder blades all the way down.  Oh, that's legitimate.  That's a good...  Coochie-coo.  Oh, you like Joe?  Joe.  Really sexy.  I'm very much enjoying this.  And then she's like, she's climbing up on the table with me, but she stays dressed the 
[00:23:00]  whole time.  Again, she has legit...  I think they're really...  If they get raided, there's a towel on you, which means nothing.  But if a cop was to raid it, that's all covered.  Right.  It could be legit.  Could be.  So she's like rubbing me down from like being on top of me.  And then she starts like blowing in my ear.  Ooh.  And the only other time a girl did that, her breath smelled like homeless feet.  And Bob Kelly, I told her, he goes, what do you expect?  They live in those places.  They're all eating fish off a hot plate in the back. 
[00:23:30]  I'm like, yeah, you're right.  They're going to shove the rice and fish heads down their throat as quick as possible.  Yeah, before the next humiliation shows up.  But this was actually really good.  And her breath was very fresh.  She had chewed gum.  And then she rolls me over.  She does the feet.  And wow, was it a good one.  Yeah.  A really good one.  Kissing my cheek a little bit.  But then she starts talking.  I just kind of ruined it a little bit.  Oh, okay, baby.  No.  Okay, baby.  Shut your face. 
[00:24:00]  And as I'm finishing, she's going, okay, okay, okay.  Who told you that was sexy?  Just say, okay.  What?  Okay.  Okay, baby.  Men are like, okay.  Remember, we had somebody on the show that will remain nameless that was talking about the massage parlor.  Yeah.  And when it got to that moment, remember?  Yeah.  The Asian massage therapist went, whee!  She goes, whee! 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Exactly why.  I very rarely do.  Whee!  Whee!  And then the nameless Adam Ferrara was really quite degraded at the whole thing.  Look, I don't feel like blowing up anyone's spot.  Okay, okay, okay.  Because that was, you know, and I actually...  How many okays did you get?  A few.  Quite a few.  And it would have been more, believe me, if it wasn't my second one of the day.  The first one, of course, happened in the afternoon when I wanted to drive in a jersey. 
[00:25:00]  It was one I had wanted to see.  Yeah?  Yeah, because she's a massage therapist slash dominatrix.  Oh, of course.  So I had to go in and get that done.  I wonder you're so tired, dude.  You are an addict.  You're just driving all over the tri-state area.  I'm a psychopath.  You are an addict.  As the one in jerseys massaging me in the afternoon, the white gloves go on.  I go, oh, this is going to be a doozy.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  She gloved up?  Oh, did she?  Guess who she taught a lesson to?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You know, for the massage.  Of course.  Oh, it was fantastic.  It makes the gloves slide better over your shoulder blades. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When they're massaging.  And then when she's massaging your legs, you turn over on your back.  Because then you realize she's a dominatrix, too.  Because then you throw a few extra bucks and you go, I would love a salty beverage.  Oh, well, there you go.  I would love a salty beverage.  So margaritas all around.  Absolutely.  What I don't get about this whole thing is.  You are so sick and twisted.  So you do the jersey thing in the afternoon, right?  Boy, did I.  Wasn't that good enough for the day?  You'd think. 
[00:26:00]  You would think.  One would think, yes.  You would think one toot of cocaine would be good enough.  You'd think one little booting of heroin.  You got all the naughtiness out of you for the day.  Yeah, I did.  But then there was a little more naughtiness, apparently.  Apparently the naughtiness built up in a certain part of him.  Some very extreme naughtiness, yes.  And the one in Jersey is kneeling between my legs to rub your thighs.  Like, you're on your back.  And to get your thighs rubbed, she's kneeling on the table between your legs.  Yeah.  But, like, you know how, like, when you're getting a massage, you want to straighten your legs out?  Because you have to.  And your toes, like, you know, every guy knows. 
[00:26:30]  Your toes have to point.  Yeah.  And you're trying to really relax.  You want to be stretched.  And when someone's got a glove on and things are really happening, you have to go, ah, you know, you might want to move the hand.  Oh, my God.  I can't concentrate.  Wow, man.  And I got to tell you, that one was really sexy.  Yeah.  Let's just say, thank God I closed my eyes.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So, he scored two, including a headshot. 
[00:27:00]  Guess what I did last night, guys?  I watched Chicken Little.  Yeah.  I hope he's not watching Chicken Little.  I'm asleep by 530.  And our pal Jimmy is all over the tri-state area.  Yes.  Chasing addiction.  Chasing his addiction.  I want love so bad.  And I don't, oh, not under here.  A never-ending quest for love.  Not over here.  Hey, this comes up from time to time.  Let's say hi to Jim in Pennsylvania.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, I can't believe this guy's on the hottest radio show in the country, and he's going 
[00:27:30]  to a scrub and tug.  Dude.  Yeah.  I can't disagree.  But that's, here's the thing with me you'll understand.  I'm a dirty boy.  But every time I like a girl for the right reasons, every time, they're like, it could  work out.  They don't let, they don't, they're not interested.  So, I've learned that that's just not the way to go.  You can't, I'm telling you, there's always a problem.  They live too far away.  Or they're psychopaths, or they're attracted to you one way, but they don't want to be,  it's just, I've given up on it. 
[00:28:00]  That's a relationship.  Dude.  For the most part, that is, there is something that each party is going to have to kind of  deal with.  Yeah.  You know?  And it's not just, you can't go to your girlfriend or wife and toss her a few bucks and have  her put a glove on and then leave her alone for the rest of the time and then come back  when you feel so inclined.  There has to be some attention given.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about girls that I've actually liked for the right reasons, like girlfriend  reasons.  Like, where I'm not, like, I always know, like, if I'm not, like, rolling around on 
[00:28:30]  my sheets, sweating like an animal, thinking about them before bed.  Yeah.  Like, if I don't need to, you know what I mean?  And then I'm like, all right, I kind of like her.  And the last, like, five girls I've liked, like, where I haven't been into that, like,  where I'm like, all right, well, they're single, nothing's going on, nothing.  And they're all women that know me well.  Yeah.  It's not like they don't want to let them get to know you.  I've let them get to know me.  They reject it.  But you don't have the patience.  I've been around you, Jim.  You don't have the patience.  I can't say where she's from, but the last one I talked about, at one point, exactly as  I called it, with who I knew. 
[00:29:00]  I just, I always know.  It's uncanny.  If you found someone you really, really love or like, whatever, are you willing to put  in the time?  Yeah.  Possibly not even get any action for, God forbid, a month.  Don't be a goose.  Yeah, I would.  Are you willing?  Or would it drive you nuts?  I don't think you have the time.  No, I could do that.  Or even if it was sexual, even if we had sex or like, it didn't, that sex thing doesn't  matter to me, like, if I have to wait or if I have to wait.  Because I've seen some strange things hanging out with Jimmy where.  Strange things hanging out with Jimmy.  Well, no.  I mean, we'll be.  Hanging out of. 
[00:29:30]  We'll be, we'll be, just to keep this broad, we'll be hanging out and there's a girl he's  interested in that's a very normal girl.  Yeah.  And he gets very frustrated that they won't go home with him immediately.  And then he thinks there's something wrong with him.  When the girl's just, you know, a cool chick and wants to hang and get to know him a little  bit and maybe.  I've seen him question his moves.  And maybe at the end of the night, maybe she'll go home to make out with him a little  bit.  But he wants the whole deal immediately.  That's when it's a sexual thing. 
[00:30:00]  I do rush that.  I've seen that happen with him on a few different occasions.  And I'm like, wow, Jimmy, this girl's just a regular girl that wants to kind of get to  know you, but she doesn't want to get laid.  She's not looking to hook up.  I mean, but it's not about sex.  But put it this way.  I know you.  You're not going to hook up, especially for any real relationship with a dog, with an ugly  girl.  Right.  No.  If she's hot, you're going to want to have sex with her immediately.  So you really are defeating. 
[00:30:30]  Not necessarily.  Jimmy really wants a girlfriend.  I kind of do.  Jimmy really wants a normal girlfriend.  He wants to be loved.  I want to be hugged.  Just like anyone else.  He needs real love.  Not.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Like I kept asking the same question over again.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, let's really fast.  Let's go to Dave in Indianapolis.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Thanks for calling, Dave.  Welcome to the program.  Hey, man.  Jimmy, how would you feel if you knew that these girls were traffic victims and they were 
[00:31:00]  actually performing these acts against their will, even though they seem like they're  kind of into it?  Way to be a killjoy.  I don't know.  Probably better about it.  It's their way into the country.  I'd feel bad.  By the way, when you pay at the end, I forgot to say, you have to give $100 to the house.  And I will say this.  It really was a good massage.  Like it was a relaxing, a very, I'm not saying she's licensed, but they know how to give you  a real like spine rub.  Deep tissue massage.  I could, I didn't get it that deep, but I mean, it was like, I'm a baby. 
[00:31:30]  But then she goes, who is your masseuse?  And I go, Angela.  And they have a little purse they put up there that says Angela on it.  And you peel off your tip and put it in there.  Hey, was there a little speakeasy type of a window that you had to knock through?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's what I'm saying, dude.  It was, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It wasn't one of those places, dude.  This reminded me of a Brazilian place where it's very well-run.  It's very open.  But they have all their precautions covered.  And no, it's not seedy like that.  You don't feel like you're going to get robbed.  Or it's not, it's very immaculately clean. 
[00:32:00]  Okay, right on.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  I'm good.  All right.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Hey, Paul.  You're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What do you say?  I have a girlfriend.  She's a pain in the ass.  So, you know, every once in a while, I'll go to a massage parlor.  And the last time I was there.  He had to vindicate himself there.  He had to, like, make it okay.  You know, I got it.  She's a pain in the ass.  So sometimes I just have to cheat.  The last time I was there, you know, feeling relaxed, laying down. 
[00:32:30]  I have these stretch marks on my stomach because I'm a fat piece of, you know.  And she, you know, she's straddling over me, and she starts rubbing my stomach, and she's  like, what's this?  And I said, oh, you know, my cat scratched me.  And she goes, no, you're too fat.  So I was like, I realize I'm getting made fun of by an Asian sex slave who's gone over here  by a pot.  You're too fat.  Too fat.  Oh, how awful.  Oh, that's great.  Punch it out, guys.  We always talk about the hierarchy, how they, that's like right when they get out of the 
[00:33:00]  shipping container and get to this country, they have to pay off their debt that gets  them from some Asian country to here.  And there's a hierarchy.  They got to start out at the Yankee Cranky shop.  They do a really good job.  If they do a good job, they move up to the nail place.  Or the back waxing.  Or the back waxing, something non-sexual, you know, doing nails.  And then the ultimate, if you're doing well, is you end up a waitress at a sushi place. 
[00:33:30]  And usually it's all in the same building, by the way.  In the same building, right.  The basement.  Like sushi, massage upstairs, nails right next door.  You can tell them all good.  When me and Hope go out to sushi or something like that and the waitress screws up, we go  like, oh, no.  Oh, no.  You know where she's going back to?  Oh, boy.  You can tell who just came out of the Yankee Cranky shop because she grabs two California  rolls at a time and squeezes it until all the avocado flies out. 
[00:34:00]  No, you idiot.  Stop your spilling it.  Okay.  Okay, Joe.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Whee!  No, I'm eating that.  And I don't have an Asian fetish.  A lot of guys love that.  I don't have a fetish for or against any type of girls.  Hey, let's go to Andrew in Virginia Beach.  Andrew.  Jimmy, just an observation.  Uh-oh.  As you get closer to women, don't you figure they know your radio personality, they start 
[00:34:30]  to listen to the show, and know that you're getting whacked off by hookers every other  day?  Dude, I've thought of that.  You know what?  I'm beyond caring.  First of all, their laundry is all dirty, too.  I mean, I know what you're saying about, aren't you worried a nice girl is going to hear  that?  Who cares?  Look what they do.  Accept you for you.  And please, if you think I don't know, I'm an ugly nobody.  If I was a rock star, Motley Crue went a month without showering.  And I'm not comparing myself to a rock band, but I'm saying, don't all of a sudden act 
[00:35:00]  like, well, you're a naughty boy and girls aren't going to like that.  They don't care about that.  If they like you and they know you're not going to mistreat them, they'll deal with  your past as long as they know you're disease-free.  I don't think those Motley Crue girls they were getting were any keepers either.  I think they were throwing those off the side of the boat.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not saying they're all doctors, but you know what I mean?  You know, the guy has a point, though.  Perhaps a nice girl that knows your background and what you're into is looking, going, you  know, I do like him and stuff.  But that's that one thing, the fact that he goes to these places. 
[00:35:30]  Well, you know, they don't know what's real and what's not real.  And a lot of the times they find out, like, oh, he's a much nicer guy than I thought he'd  be.  He's not the guy I thought he was going to be.  But you were indeed sitting in a robe with men watching the game, waiting.  So what?  It's a bunch of guys watching the game.  So what?  What's wrong with the game?  Men.  Robes.  Men.  Game.  A bunch of men watching TV.  Asian girls.  Passing out Viagra.  Right.  Oh, I didn't need that.  No?  No.  Cialis?  No, I don't think Cialis.  No? 
[00:36:00]  My heart rolls.  It messes your chest up.  It's bad for you.  Just Viagra?  No, it's worse.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was doing that in Brazil.  I was doing 100 milligrams a night and I couldn't finish because that makes it really hard.  So I was going to three girls.  One.  All right, you couldn't get the job done.  How about you?  All right, no.  Let's see if you get it done.  It was, I was like a fat kid in a chocolate shop.  I would take one bite of each piece and throw it back.  Just want to be loved.  Just wants a little love.  Just a little loving.  Just somebody to hang out.  There's a balance between sex and being that attracted to somebody and loving them. 
[00:36:30]  And I find that a lot of times and just something screws it up.  I can't just have a crush on somebody and no sexual attraction.  And I can't just lust them.  Well, that's natural.  You have a crush on somebody.  If you really are into somebody and want to pursue the relationship, there is a sexual thing there.  It's natural.  It's not just going to be no sex.  You're just looking at them like they're going to be great people to hang out with.  You know, but it's a balance.  There's a balance there.  You can't put too much emphasis on any one thing. 
[00:37:00]  If there's too much emphasis just on the sex, then it's purely a lustful relationship.  If there's too much emphasis on just, you know, the hanging out and there are great people to be with and around and conversationalists, then there's not enough emphasis on the sex.  And you have a friendship.  You know, there is a balance.  It's difficult, Jimmy.  You're right.  And the balance does not contain wearing that thin robe and a room full of men waiting for, okay, okay, okay.  Hey, Johnny in Jersey, what do you got? 
[00:37:30]  Hey, how you doing, Jimmy?  Hey, buddy.  Listen, one of my friends that I perform with, you know who she is.  She tells me that when you guys go out, you've got girls around you and you're such a nice guy and everything.  Why don't you hook up with one of them when you're on a show?  What do you mean, like females that come to shows?  Either that or the comedians.  I mean, she's a good-looking girl.  I think you know who I'm talking about, Tracy.  Well, just the first name, Tracy.  Is she a comedian? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, she's a comedian.  She's from South, like Texas.  She has a boyfriend.  Oh, she does.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw her the other night.  We can say her name.  She's a friend of mine.  Her name is Tracy Jane.  She's a good comedian.  She's a good buddy of mine.  She's a boyfriend.  There's a difference when you're friends with somebody because Tracy and I have worked together before,  but there's no sexual tension because she's my friend and she's a comic.  I don't like to handle the comedians because it's just, you know,  there's something creepy about that. 
[00:38:30]  I've been around for a long time.  She's newer.  I just don't like to do that.  It's predatorial to try to hit on somebody.  So you keep it completely just friend-wise.  Yeah, man, because it's like she's nice and she's trying to make it like I am.  There's something kind of scumbagish about that.  I'm saying that after I've paid someone who's probably been sent over on a ship and is not enjoying it.  Some guys are awful with other guys' girlfriends and stuff where they come up and they're all flirty and like,  just, dude, shut up.  And they're the ones that don't have the girlfriends, never have a girlfriend.  They're just walking around, like you said, predatorial, looking to scope out other guys' girlfriends. 
[00:39:00]  So they're all flirty and annoying and thinking they're making time.  Yeah, no, no.  This girl, he's talking about his boyfriend.  It's easy when you're friends, though.  Like when you're friends, she says I'm a nice guy because she knows she's very safe with me.  It's like, but the last women that I've liked, and there's been women that I've been sexual with that I really liked and it didn't work out,  but I'm not as bummed out because at least I know they liked me.  Do you understand?  If you hook up with somebody, you go out a couple times, and you wind up not dating,  and you're like, at least that person liked me, and whatever circumstances, you can live with that. 
[00:39:30]  Aww.  But you know how it is.  I'm saying it's like, they liked me.  They liked me.  Everyone wants to be liked.  Every guy does.  Yeah.  But when the last few strictly platonic female friends you've had that you've liked have,  it's like, well, once women get to know you, they don't like you, so what are you doing?  Why would you ever be nice?  It's stupid.  You're a sucker.  It's true.  All right, let's go to Scott in Philly.  Scott, listening to us on a fine radio station called WISP. 
[00:40:00]  What's up, Scott?  Hey, guys.  I'm also an ex-molist, and I have to point out that the fine CBS fans have never heard the Jimmy's mom, Dr. Phil call.  Oh, God.  We've got a plan that's going on.  All right.  I completely forgot about that.  Yeah.  Hey, is there any buzz in Philly yet, Scott?  Absolutely.  I'm seeing more and more people in my job and other people talking about you guys.  I've got my boss listening to you.  Nice.  It's really growing.  I forget that.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Scott.  I forget that a lot of people who would just listen to free radio in the morning because next time we got so used to people having subscriptions and we knew who you were because, you know, you were regular callers. 
[00:40:30]  And you forget the difference between this and satellite is people tend to stumble on you more here.  Right.  Because every car has a radio.  Yeah.  And they just flip through.  And I see my buddy Tyler in acting class goes, I was listening to it the other day.  And my first thing is you have – oh, yeah, that's right.  You can just turn it on.  And you go, oh, you're that cheap bastard.  And flip on it.  I didn't want to pay for it.  I'm getting a lot of that in New York.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, my God.  We're on a commercial radio station here in New York now. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, exactly.  People, I heard the show this morning.  Oh, you did.  Yeah.  Looking for music or something.  They just happen to hear voices, so they stop and – yeah.  Well, that's why we call it the O&A virus.  It's slowly but surely spreading all over Philly, it sounds like.  Hey, let's play this going into break.  So, you know, Jimmy, one of the most open people we've ever done radio with.  It's unbelievable what he'll admit on this program.  A little too much.  And especially knowing –  I'm going to keep it in my hat.  Yeah, that's what I'm wondering about.  It's got to be frightening.  That's what I'm wondering because everyone holds back something. 
[00:41:30]  I'm sure criminal charges would be fine if he spilt that.  It's actually probably not what you think.  No.  No.  All right.  So – and the weird part is his mom and dad are hardcore fans of the show, and poor  Jimmy's mom listens to the program every day religiously, and she left a little message  on Jimmy's machine after he talked about his sexual addiction and hookers on the program.  Because she watches Dr. Phil.  Right.  And he's so enlightening.  So this is actually a message left by Jimmy's mom. 
[00:42:00]  And I will say to my own credit, good for me for saving it and embarrassing her nationally.  There you go.  Here it is as we go to break.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here.  But we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, the ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful  thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs. 
[00:42:30]  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to half an hour, and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also, there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just am thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling. 
[00:43:00]  So don't get offended or think I'm strange.  But I am a mother, and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything's falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie? 
[00:43:30]  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  It's like punch-down, women scream, Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings at 6 to 9.  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Crappy day in New York City.  I'm sure it's sunny somewhere.  Apparently, my power is out. 
[00:44:00]  In the neighborhood?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I thought there was a big, giant generator.  Isn't there a big Jew generator that kicks in when the power goes out?  Something.  Jewish neighbors.  Jewish neighbors.  People in my neighborhood.  Install a generator.  That kicks in.  I don't care if it's just for my house.  You should just get your own generator.  I could do that.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  I should do that.  Generator for the house. 
[00:44:30]  Order that.  Well, the Paul McCartney thing is getting pretty interesting.  It's got legs.  It's got legs.  One.  It's got legs.  Yeah.  God, did we go off on that yesterday at the end of this show.  Yeah, the second half of the Opie and Anthony show, exclusively on XM, was just terrific.  It was just terrific yesterday.  A free-for-all of comics just going off for about a half hour on Mrs. McCartney's leg and their breakup, the breakup of their marriage. 
[00:45:00]  Well, the headline in the post today, Paul's sick of stormy heather.  Stormy heather because it sounds like weather.  And what it would be with...  Oh, boy.  They're just terrific with the headlines in the post, aren't they?  Wow.  Very clever every single day.  Nothing but cleverness from the New York Post.  But I was reading this story this morning thinking, man, you would think a Beatle, Paul McCartney in particular, would have the perfect marriage. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  You would think someone like Paul McCartney wouldn't have to deal with a bad marriage, a nagging wife.  Right.  A legend.  There's a lot of people out there in horrific marriages, but they don't have a choice, really.  Where are they going?  No.  Exactly.  So they're stuck.  They didn't write yesterday.  Yeah.  They didn't write yesterday.  You would think if you wrote yesterday, you would have the perfect marriage.  After Let It Be, you should be able to strangle your wife every time she gets mouthy. 
[00:46:00]  And apparently she was lipping off to him.  Well, let me read this.  This is just unbelievable.  Paul McCartney's marriage is beyond help.  Oh, I get it.  Help.  Another song.  Can they stop with the song title?  Why is it?  Because she has one leg and she's a day tripper?  All right.  Okay.  It could be funny.  All right.  Get all the Beatles songs.  Get the catalog in front of us, please. 
[00:46:30]  Immediately.  Paul McCartney's marriage is beyond help because he's sick and tired of his wife's constant nagging,  according to published reports.  He's got a nagger.  A nagger.  He had a nagger.  Oh, boy.  That used to be illegal.  He had a nagger.  Oh, I got you.  A nagger.  Goddamn nagger.  You know, the girls.  Who the hell likes a nagger?  No one.  When you sit there and they are just going at you. 
[00:47:00]  He's a nagger lover.  Map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map.  A lot of guys crave that because their mothers are like that.  Yeah.  A lot of guys crave a nagger.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Yep.  Anyway.  Enough is enough, he told pals before making the blockbuster announcement Wednesday that  he is going to split up with his ex-model.  Sir Paul is said to be upset over a campaign of shrew-like behavior by 38-year-old Heather  Mills McCartney.  That last name, right there alone, gives him the right to do anything he wants with her. 
[00:47:30]  Heather Mills McCartney.  Not Heather Mills.  Just getting on his case.  What a dumb broad.  You have one leg and you landed a beetle.  Shut your mouth.  Yeah.  She was a, you know, though, the, uh, when you're married to a nagger, they can't help  it.  They really can't.  It's in their genes.  It's in their genes.  It's part of their personality.  I, I was married to a nagger. 
[00:48:00]  I was.  You, Anthony?  I was married.  Married to a nagger?  To a nagger for, uh, nine years.  Just got nagged about a lot of things.  Uh, I'd come home and, uh, it would start, you know?  What I didn't do.  I didn't do my chores.  My chore was doing a goddamn radio show and bringing home what they call the bacon.  Attaboy.  Bringing home the, I was the breadwinner.  And I'd come home and, and what did I get? 
[00:48:30]  Well, I see the garbage is piling up.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is, nagger.  But I am half of the O.P. and Anthony show.  I would turn around and just go.  So go F yourself.  I'd go, nagger, please.  Just get off my back.  And, uh, you know, I finally, you know, finally showed her after nine years.  That's right. 
[00:49:00]  Here's half of everything.  Here's half of everything.  That's right.  You showed her.  You don't get it all.  You showed her nine years later.  When you're an ex-Beatle and you're married to a one-legged broad, here's how every discussion should go.  Okay.  I'm a little tired.  Are you, honey?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, it's sunny out.  Is it, honey?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Tickle, tickle, tickle.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:49:30]  Every conversation.  I haven't showered in three weeks.  You haven't, honey?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, Bill from Waterford.  Oh, crap.  It just updated.  Hold on a minute.  Where are they?  It did.  It did.  It did.  What happened?  You're kidding.  You're kidding.  The instant feedback's going nuts here.  Bill in Waterford.  I heard Paul was seeing a mistress named Michelle Hisbel. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, yuck.  Did you hear that?  Where?  At the water cooler?  You dope.  All right, moving on here.  She allegedly belittled him about his age.  Holy.  How can she even be alive?  She allegedly belittled him about his age, complained about people he worked with.  Complained with people he worked with?  Wait a minute.  Even Paul McCartney's not safe from one of these naggers. 
[00:50:30]  It's not like he's just working at some office.  It's not like he's got a bunch of buddies that have regular jobs and they're hoping to get a little band together for some weekend gigs.  Guy works with legends.  Right.  He's been knighted.  He's Sir Paul McCartney.  Oh.  He should be untouchable.  He is untouchable.  What a dump.  So he complained about people he worked with and even had the gall to mock the most famous songwriter in pop music history because his most recent album did not do as well as he had hoped. 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  He must have just laid there just going, what am I doing?  I'm Paul McCartney.  Do you think one day he was in the shower humming, get back?  And he said, Jesus, I wrote that.  I can dump her.  I can dump this broad.  Why would you tolerate that?  What have you contributed, stupid model?  What have you done besides have headphones on in 93 and not heard the of the oncoming motorcycle? 
[00:51:30]  And you know Paul can go out there, it doesn't matter what his age is, what he looks like, anything, and score some girl in her 20s.  Any time he wants.  Or whatever, just a nice girl.  Whatever.  Yeah, that means something.  Dude, he's, well, he's 60.  I mean.  But I mean she's, the thing is she's ragging about his age.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  He can go out.  And get whatever.  And, you know, trump her by getting a two-legged girl that's half her age. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  38.  38.  That might be good.  19, yeah.  Okay.  There you go.  That works.  Twice the legs, half the wrinkles.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Here we go.  So it moves on.  For her part, Heather has been telling friends that the former Beatle is equally to blame for not showing much concern when she was forced to deal with complications from her leg, which was amputated in 1993 after a motorcycle accident.  He's quite tired of hearing about it.  Really? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, I pretend.  Enough about the leg.  I pretend you have it.  He's always got an Afghan over her from the knees down.  They're at the beach.  You look a little chilly, love.  Perhaps a blanket.  We're at the beach, Paul.  Yes, I know.  Just put it on.  I don't like being reminded.  Put sand on it.  Do you mind if I bury you today?  I'll bet you should lay there.  He just buries her the second they get to the beach.  No, it's good fun, isn't it? 
[00:53:00]  Or she'd lay out there, and he'd get some water, and he'd, like, mold a sand extension so it looked like.  And then he'd have sex with her.  Like the one leg was just sand covered.  And then in the winter, let's go outside and make a snow leg.  Can you imagine how awful her snow angel must have looked?  Oh, God.  Stupid stump pushing snow all willy-nilly.  Bunching it up in a place it shouldn't be. 
[00:53:30]  By the way, Bill from Waterford is fighting back.  Jimmy, no, I didn't hear it near the water cooler.  I heard it from Eleanor Rigby.  All right.  Bill's really letting me have it.  And then Ron from Brooklyn.  His wife goes to Home Depot for a pedicure.  They're just coming in like crazy.  He just didn't like the leg that she kept in a jar by the door.  Who was it for?  Yo, wife. 
[00:54:00]  How do we get sucked into this stupid song, bitch?  We just can't resist any type of wordplay that makes fun of her leg gun.  Well, Bert from Philly, she belittled him.  Keeps updating what I want to read.  She belittled him, so he bewittled her down a few notches.  Ah, whittle her down right.  There you go.  Someone's going to have to keep track of the instant feedback.  It's just updating way too fast to keep up.  Get back.  Get back. 
[00:54:30]  Get back your leg or you're gone.  Let's say hi to Sally in Chicago.  Sally, what's up?  Wait, Hawk just handed me one.  Steve from Bayside.  The long and wooden leg.  Pretty good.  Thank you, Steve.  Well, Zoltek from Philly.  I wonder if her leg is made of Norwegian wood.  Maxwell's silver leg.  There's many we can go with here.  Sergeant Pepper.  Lonely legs club band. 
[00:55:00]  That one leg must just feel like a goose.  Looking over, seeing nobody.  No friend.  Silly collapsed pants.  It's like Jimmy.  Just wants love.  Just wants to be loved.  Somebody to be another leg to stand next to.  Probably doesn't shave it that much.  No.  You know, the shaving must be so awkward.  You know, the one goes all the way down to the toes.  The other one is like, ah, I forgot.  How does she do that?  Because a lot of girls shave.  They put the leg up on either the shower, the end of the shower, or the toilet.  Something equally as sexy. 
[00:55:30]  And then they shave their leg.  If she does that, she's on the floor.  She probably shaves while she's on the bowl.  It's called killing two birds with one stone.  And neither of them attractive.  Nothing sexy.  Killing two birds with one motorcycle.  Let's go to Sally in Chicago.  Sally.  They'd have a fight, and he'd keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.  And then he wouldn't.  Of course.  And that ain't going to happen.  Happiness is a wood leg.  McCartney, a romantic heartthrob to millions and a famous animal lover, felt he was falsely accused of having a cold heart. 
[00:56:00]  Paul decided he had enough.  He's someone who's had adulation and praise almost all his life, but he felt with Heather he could never do right.  Can you believe that?  Who is the veg?  Who's the veggie?  The vegetarian?  Him.  Is it him?  Yeah.  He's big on emeralds.  And she...  Linda McCartney, I think, got him in.  Yeah, Linda, and that helped her keep her healthy.  Jesus Christ.  You know, you could add a steak there, woman.  But was she into that? 
[00:56:30]  Probably on some level, I'm sure.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, sure.  Because I know they get peeved watching people eat burgers and stuff.  Any backstage things that happen, you can't have any meat back there at all.  Kenny, have something to contribute?  She's a big animal rights activist.  Yeah.  She's with Pete and everything.  So is his daughter, Stella.  Yeah.  Another big animal rights activist.  Well, Stella didn't like Heather.  Yeah.  Is it true that motorcycle accident thing is just a cover-up that she caught her leg in  a trap and had to chew it off, and that's why she's an animal rights activist? 
[00:57:00]  If Professor Anthony says so, it's got to be gospel.  I've got a mic in front of me.  It must be true.  I don't blame his kids for hating Heather.  Yeah, Stella McCartney does not like Heather.  Good.  Yeah, that said exactly that.  Matt in Indiana.  Yeah.  If you're a nagger lover, would you have humble fever?  Car crash.  Yeah.  I'm a little too far, and I don't understand what he's even talking about.  We're talking about nagging wives and girlfriends like Heather Mills, and, you know, I was in 
[00:57:30]  a relationship there for a few years.  As a matter of fact, today would have been my wedding anniversary.  How many years?  What year would it have been?  I was married in 1990.  It's supposed to be 16.  It would have been 16 years.  Happy anniversary.  Happy anniversary.  Happy anniversary.  Happy anniversary.  Happy anniversary.  And, of course, the only reason I know that today would have been my anniversary is because  the listeners reminded me, because they all know, because it ended up in the newspaper during 
[00:58:00]  my divorce proceeding, because I was on the stand.  And I was asked by none other than fat, bloated attorney, Dominic Barbara, who my wife hired as her attorney.  Anthony, can you tell me what date you were married?  When was your wedding date?  And I sat there like a deer in headlights, and I had to answer, I don't remember.  I don't remember. 
[00:58:30]  I get it mixed up because I lived out in San Juan Capistrano, California, for many years  when I was growing up.  And Swallows Day, big festival out there, the Fiesta de las Galantrinas, and the Swallows  would come back to Capistrano.  It's a legend.  Everyone knows about it.  And that was March 19th.  So I couldn't figure out if it was March 19th or May 19th.  It was equally as important to me, my marriage and Swallows Day.  Hey, look, if you associate your marriage with Swallows Day, it couldn't have been all bad. 
[00:59:00]  Very good.  Joe's got a good one.  I hope he pulls it off.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, Joe?  Yeah, Paul knew it was time to let her go when he called himself humming,  here comes the stump every time she walked in the room.  Here comes the stump.  Doo-doo-doo-doo. 
[00:59:30]  It's so wrong.  Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  Very good.  Comes the stump.  So there you have it, the latest on Paul McCartney.  Yeah.  We got cigarette ads.  We got Tyra Banks going to prison.  You want to take a break and get into the Tyra Banks stuff?  Tyra's good, man.  I like her.  Oh, we can't get enough of Tyra Banks.  She does a good show.  Yeah.  Because she makes it all about herself.  I guess Tyra Banks, what, spent three hours in prison?  Yeah.  And now she's claiming she knows how it's like to be in prison? 
[01:00:00]  Than, you saw the show.  We made Than watch the Tyra Banks show.  Aw, that's not even a Paul McCartney song.  Well, what, what?  Is this true?  That whenever Paul had to grab a wrench when she started singing Footloose?  Hey.  That could get annoying.  Hey, by the way, Axel in New York raises an excellent point.  If Heather gets half of Paul's money, she's still only going to be nagger rich.  Oh, wow. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, of course.  Mike from Kentucky.  Shake it up, baby, now.  Limp and shout.  All right.  Footloose.  Footloose.  That's the one right there.  Than, the Tyra show.  Uh, yeah, she decided to, uh-oh.  She decided to put herself in prison for about, uh, maybe an afternoon.  Yeah, an afternoon, so she could know what it's like, the nitty-gritty dirt of the prison life. 
[01:01:00]  She actually said the point of her visit was to try to figure out why so many people were in prison.  Yeah, and that'll do it, spending a little afternoon signing autographs with the guards.  Well, we got some great clips from the Tyra Banks goes to prison show.  Tyra is the worst.  She tries to put herself in these situations for ten minutes to really get to what these people feel like.  And she breaks into tears.  It's, like, very emotional and everything.  And she puts herself in this position that is nothing like what people have to deal with. 
[01:01:30]  I saw the show.  Uh, she couldn't wear her hair extensions.  Oh, boy.  And she didn't have any makeup on.  So she was very believable.  Yeah.  When she spent the afternoon in prison.  Afternoon in prison.  And I think she was in a cell for a total of, uh, 15 minutes.  15 minutes.  You guys don't like Tyra.  She gets right into it.  She stinks.  She puts herself on the line.  We'll get into the Tyra thing in just a bit.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony.  These guys thrash.  Hard. 
[01:02:00]  Come on.  No.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  On both, uh, CBS and XM.  Satellite radio.  Look at that.  We're multifaceted.  Multifaceted.  You might wonder why I'm talking.  Because Jimmy spent so much time in the bathroom that, uh, Opie had to then use it. 
[01:02:30]  It wasn't long.  It was, like, a minute.  We're in the 30 seconds.  It was, like, a while to tinkle.  How long are our breaks, though?  30 minutes.  Yeah.  Like, every break we take, well, believe me, we hear it.  We know how long they are, uh, from some people.  Couldn't you have done that at the beginning of the, um, commercial break and then?  Oh, you should say that to Opie, because I agree.  But then we can all, we can all get our time in.  Well, it wasn't that long. 
[01:03:00]  No?  I just, he just walked in and he got an eyeful, as he should have.  Oh, did he?  I hope so.  Yeah, nothing as rude happens here as does at the other studio where we go in a, like,  corporate environment.  It's, uh, it's like five stalls, about three urinals, big line of sinks.  Here, it's just an individual toilet and sink.  You lock the door.  I kind of like those.  Even in restaurants where you walk in, you know you're going to be alone.  I don't like that, uh, going and then having someone else walk in.  Yeah, absolutely.  And you've got to make the little turn away. 
[01:03:30]  You don't want him peeking, peeking at you going, psst, hey buddy.  Hey.  Psst.  At least I didn't have to look at his ass today.  Well, that's the treat that we get over at the XM.  Thanks, Jimmy, for sparing me, uh, that one.  Jimmy will walk into the public bathroom at our other building.  And, uh, it's a lot, it's a parade because we have such short time to, to use the facilities  over there, that it's a line of people walk.  Jimmy's usually in the lead. 
[01:04:00]  He runs out of there and goes, but he will stand by the door with his pants down to his  ankles, with his back end facing the door, touching his toes.  And then we, uh, we walk in and he's right there.  It's like you almost walk right into him and assault him.  It's every time.  It's funny every time.  Every time.  Hysterically funny.  And disgusting at the same time.  Hey, uh, why don't we move on to the Tyra Banks thing? 
[01:04:30]  Because MTV's waiting to, uh, to, uh, film Big A and Twitchels for, uh, True Life.  Actually filming, uh, Twitchels for True Life.  Who's my sweatshirt?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Why?  I think they're going to get a hold of, uh, Big A though.  That's what I'm thinking.  And make a whole show.  Yeah, they got a cold line.  Big A's going to have his new show on MTV.  It's going to be called...  How do you spell that?  I want to see the promos for that one.  Yo, MTV. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Could host TRL.  All right.  And then 50's posse could just beat him.  Could be called shorties, jerking shorties.  From what we saw on Pal Talk that day.  Yikes.  All right.  So we got Tyra Banks.  She did a show on going to prison.  And of course, she has to make it about herself no matter what she's talking about.  Everything she does is about herself.  Always comes back to herself.  She's the one that had to suffer. 
[01:05:30]  She's the one that's showing the misery.  The person that is actually in this situation is secondary to Tyra.  In any situation.  Yeah.  It always comes around to Tyra.  Most important.  Tyra, Tyra, Tyra, Tyra, Tyra.  So what do we got here, Than?  The intro.  Her insightful intro.  Yeah.  It's called.  This is when she really just blows the doors wide open.  It's just like watching Geraldo.  She's good, man.  She's good.  It's just like watching all those investigative reporters out there. 
[01:06:00]  Today, I am going to prison.  And I wanted to do this because I was shocked to learn that the majority of women that have  gone to prison are there because of their husbands or their boyfriends.  I got locked down.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She's sympathizing with these women.  Absolutely.  They're because of their husbands or boyfriends.  Yeah, because they killed them or assaulted them in some way, shape, or form.  I understand. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, some guys could be real bastards out there.  You know?  The woman gets a little lippy.  Guy smacks her in the face a few times.  Woman picks up a gun, shoots him.  She ends up in a jerk.  That happens.  But some of these women, they just wanted to kind of get away or get some insurance money  or something.  They're not all innocent in there.  And it's not all a Lifetime movie starring Marky Post.  She met a man she thought was perfect until it came to murder. 
[01:07:00]  But it's also women that joined their husbands in lives of crime.  Of crime, right.  Yeah.  Drug trades.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Prostitution.  She just needed a stupid angle.  Yeah, of course she did.  I got locked down as an inmate at the California Institution for Women.  And I got to tell you, it was one of the most shocking and eye-opening and terrifying  experiences of my entire life.  And I met a lot of women there.  I'm talking about hardened criminals. 
[01:07:30]  And a lot of them were facing life sentences for cold-blooded murder.  And they came from all walks of life.  They can be your mother, your sister.  No.  Or even your daughter.  No, they can't.  And from the moment that those iron doors shut, I discovered that life behind bars  is far worse than anything that I could have ever imagined.  She is so dramatic.  You whiny fake bitch. 
[01:08:00]  She gets the expose, man.  Because a lot of people would think the prison is fun, but she gets right to it.  It's worse than you can imagine.  I always thought it was just a blast.  She said one of the scariest things she's ever done.  While she has a camera crew, probably personal security.  Her assistant.  Personal assistant.  You guys don't know.  With a BlackBerry taking calls.  You don't put yourself on the line like she does.  Yeah, that must be it.  Well, she said it's the worst thing she could ever imagine.  She still has to imagine it because she didn't really go to prison.  Right, yeah. 
[01:08:30]  She didn't get any extra experience out of this because all she did was go into a cell  for five minutes with a camera crew.  And wouldn't the worst thing she could imagine be going to prison where all the guards are  dolphins?  Based on a show she did a few months ago where she revealed her biggest fear ever is of dolphins.  You idiot.  How about somebody worse than prison is being forced to go to prison and watch this program?  If she really wants to do it, go in there with a hidden camera. 
[01:09:00]  No security guards.  No staff.  Yeah.  And then take a shower with the inmates.  There you go.  Send her to the laundry room with nothing but bull dykes, plungers, and brooms.  And we can't tell you where to hide the camera, but at one point we should see the guard's face  looking up at it with two rubber gloves on going, that's all clear.  Here we go.  Tired to discover why people are in prison.  The United States has the largest prison population in the world. 
[01:09:30]  Number one.  California is second only to Texas in prison.  What is the world where?  With more inmates being admitted than released every year.  Thank God.  What was most disturbing to me was the fact that in the past decade, the number of women  in prison has grown twice as fast as the number of men in prison.  And I wanted to know why.  There's another one of those bone stats.  Let me explain statistics to you.  Has grown twice as fast as men. 
[01:10:00]  So if there's a million men in prison and there's four women and now there's eight, eight women.  I love statistics like that.  Do you know AIDS is growing most rapidly in the elderly community?  Is it right?  That's a stat I heard.  I wanted to ram my head through the television to get to the reporter.  That's how angry I was at that stat. 
[01:10:30]  It went from two to four.  To four old people because they all had sex with each other.  They had a big foursome one night at the home.  They all got the AIDS.  And now it's the fastest growing group of people getting AIDS.  They all rolled around in needles and laughed.  Said, what the hell?  We're 85 years old.  What are we going to do?  Can't happen to us.  At 95?  Might as well get into some of that unprotected sex now.  Starts kicking in.  Yeah.  At 95, you start feeling some symptoms.  Right.  Right.  All right.  The next track, Tyra Banks goes to prison. 
[01:11:00]  Scared.  Strip search and cough.  Was she really strip searched then?  How did they portray this?  They shot her from the neck up.  With what type of weapon?  Oh, sorry.  Wishful thinking on my part again.  Unfortunately, it wasn't a talent gun.  We're supposed to believe that she actually would strip.  Yeah.  They make this whole thing like, oh, I have to change right here in front of everybody. 
[01:11:30]  Cool.  Yes.  And I doubt it.  Doesn't she change in front of people for a living?  Don't models do that.  We know.  We've seen enough stupid specials on models.  All those runway shows.  They've got to rip their clothes off in front of everybody and just put something else on.  Tape things up.  They don't care.  Models are not modest people.  Well, they don't all do what Tyra does.  She puts herself out there.  Shut up, Jimmy.  If you don't shut up, I'm going to kill you.  Well, better than going to prison, according to Tyra.  So kill away.  I'll end up in prison. 
[01:12:00]  Kill away, bully.  She's keeping me from killing you because she's making this sound so scary.  It is scary.  She's good.  The common theme tying female inmates together seem to be the men in their lives.  I used to make like $300 every night and stuff.  And if I didn't make $300...  Is that the man in her life?  Sorry, wrong.  If this isn't the cough track, I apologize.  This is other profound insight.  That's all right, because every clip is gold.  Yep.  I bet there's something worth making fun of it.  Of course.  The men in their life. 
[01:12:30]  Well, my man was very abusive to me.  No, this is when I think she kind of tries to encourage...  Because she meets a bunch of...  That's what it is.  A bunch of the inmates on their way out.  Oh.  Ah.  And she's going to tell them not to do it again.  Don't...  So she's going to do what all the programs in prison, parole officers, things like that.  I can't do.  Yeah.  Keep that turnover rate from getting any higher.  Tying female inmates together seem to be the men in their lives. 
[01:13:00]  I used to make like $300 every night and stuff.  And if I didn't make $300, he would beat the shit out of me and stuff.  He made me ugly and stuff, you know.  Because if you say he didn't want nobody else to have...  Where's the problem here?  You are beautiful.  You know that?  You are beautiful.  You are beautiful.  Oh, stop it.  Husbands.  Fathers.  That's an Oprah thing, by the way.  These women have made some...  You are still beautiful.  Say it.  But it didn't have to be that way. 
[01:13:30]  Today is a new day.  Yeah, I hope it was.  And you're getting out.  And your life is in your hands and in your control.  I'm going to get it all back.  It's not too late.  I'm going to get it all back.  Give me a hug.  I wanted to help them understand that no man is worth going to prison for.  Right.  No man...  That's a hoe.  Yeah.  She was married to a pimp.  That was a prostitute.  They probably weren't even married.  A prostitute?  She was a prostitute. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, but Tyra raised a good point, though.  Oh, she did, Jimmy.  Please explain.  About today's a new day.  Yeah.  Because it's always good to let somebody know that you thought yesterday was bad.  Well, guess what?  Guess what?  Here, check the calendar.  Today, new.  I think she should have said something like, today is the first day of the rest of your  life.  I like the fact she never uses cliches.  I kind of respect that.  Never.  She's always coming at you and just giving you some insight. 
[01:14:30]  She just wanted her to cry, get the hug, get lost.  You're still beautiful.  I mean, I like that.  She picks up your spirits when you're feeling blue.  You know a hoe that's been beaten by her pimp and imprisoned for God knows how many years  is still beautiful.  You're still beautiful.  Tyra, am you looking at me?  I didn't see the girl, but she probably looks like Paul Benjamin, who was English in Escape  from Alcatraz.  He was the black guy.  There's two reasons you didn't sit on my step. 
[01:15:00]  I was picturing more Hedda Nussbaum in a tanning booth.  Hedda Nussbaum after a chimney invasion gone wrong.  She's got soot.  I was thinking, Hedda Nussbaum after staining her patio.  Hedda Nussbaum after shoe polishing accidents.  All right, here's the next clip.  I really wanted to wear standard issue prison dress, but I was not allowed to because of 
[01:15:30]  state rules and regulations.  However, I would process in every other way like any other prisoner.  Yeah, like any other prisoner.  Can I have your autograph?  Murderer.  Okay, Ms. Banks, I need you to remove your jacket, put all your property up here on the  counter, and do an unclothed body search.  I changed right, just right here?  Yes.  Music is...  Did she give the dramatic look, I have to change right here? 
[01:16:00]  Change right here?  Yes, shocked and hurt a little.  Put all your possessions here, take out your wallet and your money, and put that in the  wheelbarrow.  And then I think the next one should be the actual act of her stripping and calling.  Please tell me that when it was time for strip search, a Roman emperor wearing a big ring  and a tub of lard.  In the name of the Senate, the people of Rome.  Up, Proculus.  Well, here's more powerful insight. 
[01:16:30]  Yes.  I felt violated.  Did you?  It felt too real to me.  Okay, I need to back up.  Keep backing up.  Please lift your arms.  Please lift your breasts.  I need you to spread your legs. 
[01:17:00]  Okay, I need you to squat and cough three times.  Squat and cough three times?  Do it again.  That should knock it loose.  Okay, and squat, squat.  Wow.  Okay, very good.  Even though I was going through all the motions, I know I could not handle it if I was actually  being in prison. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, shut up.  She does really good voiceovers, though.  She's a polished voiceover doer.  I know.  Do you know how many squat and coughs in that institution probably wind up with a wet  splat with a balloon full of drugs?  I don't know how that got in there.  That ain't mine.  Someone put it there.  Who knew that's how they get them to shake it loose, though?  I know. 
[01:18:00]  The cough and squat.  They figured it all out.  Yeah.  That's so you ain't got to go.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, the Cough and Squat Contest.  Oh, nice.  How else do you do it?  Pour in some Crisco and then say, play double dutch.  Balloon falls out a kid.  So she felt violated, I guess.  Yeah.  Apparently, strip searches are unpleasant.  Thanks, Tyra.  Thanks, Tyra, because they always have so much fun.  Who knew?  Let me tell you, all you got to do is tune in about two seconds of those MSNBC's exclusive 
[01:18:30]  behind-the-bar things that they do, and they show you what goes on in prisons.  Five minutes of watching one of those.  I watched Marathon one weekend.  Oh, man.  They are great.  And they just show you, like, prisons in Kentucky and this one in Arizona.  And it is the most horrifying thing, because that kind of gives you the feel of what prison's  about.  Not Tyra sitting there when asked to give over her possessions, pulling out mascara and lipstick,  and obviously not having to recover talent when she's done with the show. 
[01:19:00]  Here's the envelope of your goods.  Where's my talent?  It was never in here.  She's certainly not pulling out receipts from voiceover giving lessons.  Wow.  Listen to her voiceovers.  They're just sloppy and terrible.  Well, this next clip, Tyra Banks goes to prison 16 months versus three hours.  Yeah, this is back in studio with the, well, I think she says what she gets busted for.  Christine, I want to start with you.  Why did you go to jail? 
[01:19:30]  For petty theft.  What did you steal?  A petty.  Hygiene stuff.  Shampoo, conditioner.  Shampoo, conditioner.  Yes.  Oh, she didn't have.  From a grocery store, right?  Yes.  So you sold shampoo and conditioner.  I sold.  Probably less than 20 bucks of stuff.  And how much time did you serve?  16 months.  16 months.  Tell me about your day-to-day life.  It was a first defense.  Yeah, I'm sure.  First defense.  Yeah, exactly, Tyra.  Why don't you get into this?  She had a record, obviously.  First defense, upstanding citizen, I'm sure.  I'm sure this wasn't like the 18th time she's shoplifted. 
[01:20:00]  And I'm sure it was just shampoo.  Of course.  It had nothing to do with maybe over-the-counter drugs that are used to make methamphetamines.  Or the four pairs of Timberlands that became apparent after the old coffin squat.  20 bucks of stuff.  And how much time did you serve?  16 months.  16 months.  Tell me about your day-to-day life in prison.  What is it like?  Oh, Larry and Curly Esquire, her lawyers.  All right, you did it for 16 months. 
[01:20:30]  What lawyer gets you 16 months for shampoo?  Stop it.  What my day was like?  Wake up.  Get punched.  Do some things.  Wipe the tuna salad smell off my face.  Go to bed.  I'll be your lawyer for $19.95.  Sold.  16 months.  Don't be broad.  What was the defense?  It could have been worse.  I did it for a little bit, but you did it for 16 months. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, this is the best.  Yeah, I did it for a little bit.  All right, hold on.  Here we go.  Prison.  What is it like?  Because I did it for a little bit, but you did it for 16 months.  You get on a routine, you know.  You just do your day.  You said that prison is hell.  It is hell.  Tell me why prison is hell.  Because you're dealing with a lot of different people, a lot of different cultures.  You don't have your freedom.  Exactly.  Everybody's telling you what to do.  That's why New York is hell.  The people in the different cultures. 
[01:21:30]  Thank you.  Violence.  Thanks for adding nothing to the prison discussion.  Prison is hell.  Isn't that kind of a thing that doesn't really take an explanation?  She goes, tell me about prison is hell.  It's a statement like, war is hell.  All right.  How is war hell?  Shooting and bleeding and screaming and people dying.  It's like you just say it.  It's a saying.  It's like, tell me about the sun.  Well, it's warm.  It's warm.  Hey.  Oof.  Thanks.  The sun's hot today.  Yeah.  Thanks for that insight. 
[01:22:00]  Tell me about hot sun.  Right.  Well, hydrogen is burning at, oh, the rate in the above.  What?  Tyra's advice then about her.  Yeah.  She's, she gives a pep talk to her in studio guests and then comes back to the old Tyra.  It always full circle back to that selfish bitch.  Well, I met with you all when you were getting out and I wish you the best of luck and to  stay strong and to understand that your lives are in your hands and you have the power to 
[01:22:30]  change it.  You have to look in the mirror and say that to yourself and you have to look in the mirror and say that to yourself and know that it's here.  It's all about you.  What?  And I love the fact that you said that you have to get yourself out of the situation where you are right now because it's a negative  thing and it can pull you under.  Yeah.  So thank you guys for sharing your stories and good luck.  Thank you.  I want to go back to my day in prison and as these ladies were getting out, I was going.  I was going.  I want to get back to my day.  The only way this episode could have ended well was on a beam in a house. 
[01:23:00]  Tyra was here carved in it and her hanging from a noose.  Or a good riot.  Like mattresses on fire and a good throat cutting.  She's a snitch.  Snitches get stitches.  She's only been.  But I've only been here for 40 minutes.  But I didn't tattle on it.  She's a rat.  It's so obvious she studies the Oprah tapes.  This is all stuff Oprah says on a daily basis. 
[01:23:30]  I want Tyra to do a special called why people punch me in the face when they see me.  All right.  In the cell for five minutes, huh?  She did five minutes in a cell?  Five minutes.  Hey, those cells are small, Opie.  I wanted to sit in a cell by myself and see how it felt.  And it was something that I will never forget.  It was quiet.  It was cramped.  I can almost touch both of these walls with my arms. 
[01:24:00]  That's how small this room is.  How much dorm room?  And there are two people that have to live here.  Two people that aren't a married couple.  And let's go to the bathroom in front of each other.  We're on each other.  My possessions are in this locker.  It was the loneliest feeling I had ever experienced.  The loneliest feeling she ever experienced.  Five minutes in a cell.  It was five minutes?  I mean, it's edited.  But all she did was go in, stand with her arms wide, and then point to the toilet and leave.  That's her loneliest experience. 
[01:24:30]  This dope has no idea.  This privileged since she was a kid dope has no idea.  She just described what every guy has to go through at some point in his life, living, renting a room somewhere, living with a roommate.  Obviously, it's not prison, but it isn't for her either.  She's just describing the cell.  You're with a roommate.  You're sharing things.  Yeah, it's freshman year.  Yeah, there you go.  She just described college, freshman year. 
[01:25:00]  In a dorm somewhere.  Let's go to Nathan in Massachusetts.  Nathan, what's up?  This is Nathan.  I just wanted to say thank you guys so much because this is great.  I hate TV just for this crap reason.  All this stuff is horrible, but I miss out on a ton of good comedy.  And I'm just driving to work right now.  I'm just laughing my ass off the whole way, dude.  This stuff is gold.  We love the Tyra audio.  And, yeah, this is just the same.  There's 20 other shows that are like this that we just don't know the names of, but they're out there.  Yeah.  You know, it's just such crap on TV these days that passes off as educational, self-help. 
[01:25:30]  You know, Tyra is going to bail you out.  She's the one that's going to help you.  Just don't let the message be lost, sir, because Tyra does.  Shut up, Jimmy.  John in Arkansas, help me.  She's good.  Yeah, I just want to know, did Tyra, did she have to spend any time in the hole?  Can you imagine?  Tyra mouths, what we have here is failure to communicate.  You hurt Wolf. 
[01:26:00]  Wolf can hurt you.  Puts her in that tin shack in the sun.  Imagine her staff sets her up.  Doesn't tell her.  But transfers her to a maximum security prison somewhere.  Throw her in a hole.  But I'm Tyra back.  Shut up.  Plant some coke on her.  Take that blonde wig off, you self-hater.  Yeah, there's coke under her wig.  Want to see Tyra walk around in six months with big-headed nappy hair?  But just her giving advice to, like, change these people's lives sucks, because her secret 
[01:26:30]  was not to be a hard worker.  It was to be born ridiculously beautiful.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great advice.  Just do what I did.  Be beautiful.  Greg on Long Island.  Go ahead.  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  That's why her cell is a little cramped.  She might have had, like, the cameraman, the boom man.  How is it lonely in there?  It's not lonely.  He's fanning her.  Makeup artist.  Yeah, with the director.  She made a point, though, about how you have to look at yourself in the mirror and say, 
[01:27:00]  Shut up, Jimmy.  I control my day.  And that's, you know what?  If you take that kind of advice, you're going to be okay.  Even if you have eight more years to go.  You're in control.  Yeah.  Jerry from Long Island.  I could touch both walls with my arms out.  Has this dumb bra ever been in a car?  It's lonely.  You're in there for a few hours if you're doing a long trip.  Someone else might be in there.  Yeah, someone else could be in there.  Just how every guy she sleeps with feels.  What's the next clip?  Inmates sing? 
[01:27:30]  Oh, it's just she's trying to find a positive angle.  And then she mentions her show.  Of course she does.  So I turn it down, try to catch me.  They were locked up behind bars.  And they could still see.  I don't think they should be.  To see how far and how vast the audience that I'm reaching,  that there are these women and that they look at the show  and they're telling me it's an inspiration for them  and inspiration for them to straighten out their lives,  just makes me go, wow. 
[01:28:00]  Baby, we belong together.  My time behind bars will stay with me for the rest of my life.  These women truly touched my heart,  and what I learned definitely changed my life forever.  Wish they touched it with a shank.  Changed their life forever, though.  Who are we to say?  One girl walks by with a balloon full of gas,  and the other one throws a match,  and you burn those pretty looks right off.  Now let's see what you do.  Perpetually eyes wide open, Chris. 
[01:28:30]  You see burn victim, they always look surprised.  Like if they're just walking to their own birthday party.  For me?  Oh, my God.  Why are you so surprised?  Why are they always in the inappropriate white-eyed?  John in Jersey.  Did you ever notice that after every show,  every event that she's done,  she's never, ever going to forget it?  Every single show.  Everything is so important.  Every episode she does is so important  that it will stay with her forever. 
[01:29:00]  Forever.  When she got over the fear of the dolphins,  she'll never forget.  Never.  How I got over my fear of dolphins.  She has a memory like an elephant,  as well as the voiceover ability.  All right, we end with this final clip.  What is this, then?  More of Tyra's important work?  Oh, yeah.  It's next on Tyra.  Some other important things she's going to accomplish on the show.  All right.  What makes Tyra's newest model search so different?  We're on the go! 
[01:29:30]  Next time, Tyra's top male underwear model competition.  Oh, okay.  Sexy man from every corner of the country,  wearing next to nothing.  With a Cirque du Soleil challenge.  You almost broke your neck.  Which hunk can be manly in lace?  I've never worn that much makeup before in my life.  Celebrity judges decide.  You're taking this very seriously.  We will be Tyra's first top underwear model.  Next all new Tyra.  And it will stay with me for the rest of my life.  She wants to be taken seriously.  Yeah.  And those two shows are back to back. 
[01:30:00]  That's the back to back prison show.  And then men in their underwear.  Yeah.  Can we please get her on this show?  We've tried, man.  Impossible.  We've tried.  She ain't coming in.  Has she heard?  Huh?  I'm sure she hates us.  And as a little tease,  I have at home,  I still need to go through.  The Tyra Pranked show.  You've been Tyra Pranked.  Is that her catchphrase?  Like juiced?  Yes.  You've been juiced.  Is she going to say that to the whole country?  Like this whole show is a joke? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, look.  Who's been watching?  You're all idiots.  Yeah.  No one is this awful.  No one is this much of a self-centered pig  who has a little mustache in this photo that we were handed.  Yeah, she apparently has a lot going on there.  Oh my God.  Shouldn't she be tying someone to the railroad tracks in 1910?  Nah.  Uh-uh.  Snidely Banks.  Tyra Whiplash?  Is that really her mustache or has that been drawn on?  No, that's real.  That's real?  That looks real.  How do you know, Danny? 
[01:31:00]  Did you take the picture?  Yeah, how do you know, Dan?  She's also got like a lot of beard hair.  She looks like the cover of Prince's Greatest Hits.  It's from a high-res photo.  I know it looks like crap on the...  Can we get the high-res photo?  Sure.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We got MTV standing by.  They want to film Twitchels today for True Life.  So I guess we're going to have Twitchels and Big A do the news one more time  before we rest that bit, okay?  Rest it.  We're going to rest it.  Bury it.  We're going to rest it the same way Pesci rested Maury. 
[01:31:30]  We're going to put...  Everybody shut up.  We're going to put that bit in prison.  Let's get some Danish for Bill.  Never forget.  All right.  We'll be back.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony.  Dance party weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Comedy gone too far.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings at 6 to 9. 
[01:32:00]  Opie and Anthony.  XM2AQ.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Making their way into the studio.  Twitchels and Big A.  Here they are.  And the MTV cameras.  I don't think that mic was on, but it's all right.  What's up, Twitchels?  Yo, what's up?  How you doing?  Whoa. 
[01:32:30]  How are you doing today?  Yeah, you think they're bad normally.  I'm so nervous, man.  A little nervous of being on TV, I guess, huh?  Bring.  Someone answer the phone.  Whenever the focus is on him, it really gets bad.  How did this come about with MTV?  Well, uh...  Because this is the only reason you're on our show today, by the way.  Let's be honest.  Oh, thank you very much.  We were ready to rest this bit for a while, and all of a sudden we get a phone call.  Hey, uh, they want to film me for True Life, so... 
[01:33:00]  Well, MTV gave me a call a couple weeks ago and said that they're doing an upcoming episode  of True Life called I Have Tourette.  And they heard about me, and they gave me a call, and they were going to feature me  in the episode.  I'm really psyched about it, so I get to spread more awareness.  Are they going to...  Screw the awareness.  I think you're...  Holy crap.  Screw the awareness.  I know.  I think he's capitalizing on this whole thing by saying it's awareness, but it's not.  We were talking about you yesterday.  Really?  You're not on our show to spread awareness for Tourette's. 
[01:33:30]  You understand that, right?  You're here to be exploited because you have Tourette's.  Exactly.  And it's a goddamn funny disease.  That's all it is.  That's the truth.  That is the truth.  To spread awareness.  I pray that MTV doesn't take the serious angle on this.  I don't need to.  And show how ridiculous you are.  Is there going to be someone at the end going,  Hi, I'm Louis Santani, and I have Tourette's.  Tourette's is a serious disease.  We've had a lot of fun with this episode, but I hate when they ruin some funny disease 
[01:34:00]  show by throwing in the thing at the end.  And you don't need awareness spread about Tourette's.  If you're ever out and you hear something going,  You're pretty much aware.  You're pretty aware.  It's shut up, I'm trying to eat.  It's one of the most obvious diseases ever, yes.  Yeah, but so many people still don't know about it.  Who doesn't know about it?  People who have lucky lives.  Everyone knows about Tourette's.  People who are fortunate not enough to meet me.  At least he has the small version.  Imagine just having tour. 
[01:34:30]  Well, let's do this for MTV.  Wow.  Let's do this for MTV.  What's up, thinker?  So, Twitchels, what do you want everyone to know about Tourette's?  I want people to know that I'm just a person.  Regardless of what people say about me, what they think.  I am normal, just as normal as you, and anybody else in this room.  Well, you've made that, apparently.  He's made that blatantly obvious, hasn't he? 
[01:35:00]  Let me tell MTV something.  You should be doing a true life feature on that mess over there.  That's your star as he picks his nose.  I'm introing him and he's picking his nose.  He's got the camera on him.  Let me pick my nose.  Yeah, these two are...  And screw trying to find Jimmy Hoffa.  I say we, you know, dig up his backyard.  These should be a new host of TRL.  This is exactly who should host TRL, these two. 
[01:35:30]  Totally retarded losers.  Yeah, they're like Martin and Lewis if their parents took thalidomide.  I can't argue with that.  So, obviously, you can't argue with anybody.  So, Twitchels, the MTV cameras have been following you around for what?  Well, they just started today.  They'll be following you around all weekend.  What have they filmed so far?  Well, they just started this morning.  They filmed me coming in here, hanging out. 
[01:36:00]  You've been observing this.  What has MTV done with Twitchels so far?  Is Twitchels acting all serious?  Like, this is a real thing?  Oh, boy.  Actually, he is trying to be all serious about it.  And no one's buying it, right?  No, I'm not trying to be serious about it.  That's why I'm here, because I don't take myself too seriously.  Is there a segment?  Do they show you getting up in the morning and brushing your teeth? 
[01:36:30]  And doing, like, ordinary things?  That's exactly what they said when they called.  They said we want to get you doing things like cheating.  Just doing what you do.  Exactly.  We want to see what it's like eating a pancake with Tourette's,  doing things like that, normal-esque things.  Screw that, man.  Fantasizing in the shower.  Right.  We want to see you making a phone noise and a blackfish crashing into your gums.  They should film you jerking off.  That's the type of TV I want to see.  Yeah, they're going to film me going to step aerobics class.  Hey, MTV camera guy, make sure you film this hand at one point. 
[01:37:00]  He's a nervous wreck and his fingers move.  Make sure you film them.  He'll be self-conscious about it now, so it will happen even more.  If MTV ever wants to do a show on dead hookers, you might want to get in touch with this guy  and ask where the 55-gallon drums are on the side of the thruway.  But Twitchells, you're, of course, the star.  Oh, no.  With your Tourette's and MTV.  MTV's kind of taking an interest here.  So what do you have planned?  Anything special?  I know they want you to just go about your life, 
[01:37:30]  but you've got to do something a little extra than just, you know, get up, brush your teeth,  come here and go to bed.  Well, actually, I'm going to a Phillies game tomorrow night.  When they take on the Red Sox.  Oh, that should be great for the person sitting next to you.  Isn't that a treat?  Popcorn being thrown all over you.  Someone yell for a hot dog.  It's going to be fun because my neighbor's a Red Sox fan,  and we're going together, and I'm a Phillies fan.  It's going to get crazy.  Are you going to slap your face for MTV?  It hasn't been.  That tick hasn't been bothering me right now. 
[01:38:00]  Have you been jumping?  Yep.  What about the jump?  Yeah.  Jump?  Why don't you explain that to MTV right now?  Well, I have, as well as Tourette's syndrome, I have OCD,  and whenever I hear the word jump.  Jump.  I have the compulsion to do, so.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump all over me.  Wow, that's a good jump song.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Me and my friends get together.  Don't make them jump. 
[01:38:30]  They don't want them to jump.  All right, stop jumping.  Don't jump.  Don't jump anymore.  Don't jump.  Don't jump.  I'm going to jump.  Jump.  Jump.  You are a twitching, jumping mess.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump, you freak.  So now after the Phillies game, after the Phillies game, what do you have planned?  I'm going to brush my teeth.  More teeth brushing.  Is that good?  Do you just like plunge the toothbrush into your eye? 
[01:39:00]  Because I would love to see that.  Why are you jumping?  You shouldn't be jumping.  I love the support.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  And then what about, you're a stand-up comic, so are you going to have the cameras follow  you down?  Yeah, I have a show tonight.  Yeah, I have a show tonight in Glassboro, Jersey.  They're coming down to the Round Boy Room.  Is that what it's called? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, come see me at the...  How do you spell that, man?  I want to look it up.  I'm going to Google it.  Never heard of that comedy club.  Dude, that life has just got to be a bitch.  It looks not only mentally, it looks physically exhausting.  You look like a Jane Fonda video, to have to just, like, your muscles are constantly moving. 
[01:40:00]  You're doing aerobics all the time.  Isn't that, like, isn't that frustrating or tiring?  Do your muscles ache at night?  Oh, it definitely gets to you.  I mean, my one tick right twitched my neck.  I've had times where I'll use, like, an icy hot patch to help soothe the pain, because  it gets to pain in the ass.  You look like Michael J. Fox in a mosh pit.  But you jump around so much, how come I still got a gut? 
[01:40:30]  I don't understand.  That's so funny.  You guys know.  You should have washboard abs by now.  Really?  Too bad you don't have a crunch twitch.  Sit up one.  Two.  Wouldn't that be great?  Workout Tourette's, where all you do are push-ups and sit-ups.  Why you?  See, you've got to be around a support group like this. 
[01:41:00]  People who love and care for who you are.  Oh, stop with the serious crap.  Let MTV film that somewhere else.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, he's a good boy.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, and A, exploding Tourette's one tick at a time.  Certainly.  Yeah, we're making people aware that when they see people with Tourette's, they should  smack them.  That's right.  They should point at them.  Point at them.  Jimmy.  It's just a natural thought.  How do the kids handle it?  How do little kids who can be so cruel through their honesty, how do they handle that? 
[01:41:30]  Maybe you're out shopping or something.  That would have been a good one.  What do they do?  Wait, say that again?  What do the kids do?  Like, you're out in a supermarket, maybe, or you're out in public, and kids through their  honesty can be so cruel.  How do you handle that?  What do they do?  Oh, I have people.  Do they laugh?  Oh, well, kids or just people in general?  More so kids?  No, they're not.  No, no.  They're annoyances.  Everyone always stares and looks at me.  And, you know, it's just a part of my life right now.  I don't give a crap anymore.  That's what I, I'm not trying to be serious.  That's why I say it's okay to point and laugh because I see other people with directions. 
[01:42:00]  Jump, jump, jump.  Twitchels, you do great radio for us.  Thank you, man.  We don't care about the serious stuff.  People like you, no, I want to get serious for a minute here.  Just for a second.  People like you are walking around this earth to make people like us go, whew, and feel  better about ourselves that we're not walking around going, whew, whew, whew, whew.  That's what I say about the short bus comedy tour. 
[01:42:30]  If you're going to get one thing from it, you're going to leave feeling so much better  about yourself.  Because that ain't me.  By the way, the first, we do two shows every day.  The first half of the O.P. and Anthony show doesn't know that Twitchels likes Alman  Joyce.  Yeah, yeah, he can't.  Do you want to explain that to MTV?  Oh, God.  The Almond Joy thing is another thing associated with my OCD.  I have a fixation for Almond Joys, and if you get a bunch in front of me, I'll keep 
[01:43:00]  going until I burst.  I love it.  Yeah, feel compelled to eat every single one of them.  I haven't eaten Almond Joy in years, and I had one when we had them in the studio for  him that day.  And that coconut and that chocolate, it's amazing how good they are.  I forgot how good Almond Joy is.  Oh, wow.  This is commercial?  Why don't we get them on board?  Rachel, you've come back.  And he's got a shirt on. 
[01:43:30]  This is what cool looks like.  Really?  Is it?  And we must be nerds.  I know I left it wide open for that.  All right.  Well, their big segment on our show is the news.  They love doing the news together, because this idiot can't spit out a word and wait  until he gets to any word that starts with an S-T.  Right.  Any S-T word he really freezes up on.  I think Big A's got his TV shirt on today, too. 
[01:44:00]  He certainly does.  Did you dress because you knew you were going to be on TV today there, Big A?  Yeah.  Of course, yeah.  Oh, definitely.  He dressed in his best digs, and the hair looks good.  Anytime he thinks he's going to be on TV, he dresses nice.  So whether it's MTV or an Amber Alert, anything like that, he'll dress in his nice clothes.  What are you doing over there?  Dancing?  Wow.  Jump. 
[01:44:30]  You should try to do the break dance or something.  Well, that's what I said.  I said it would be funny to go to one of those.  You should bring back break dancing.  All right.  You want to do the news with Big A and Twitchels?  That's the only time I'm accepted when I'm dancing, dancing down at the disco.  You didn't call me, Tony.  All right.  Here it is.  The week in review kind of, or news of the day, whatever, a little of everything, with 
[01:45:00]  Big A and Twitchels.  Good morning, everyone.  It's time for the news with Twitchels and Big A.  Hey, I'm Louis Twitchels and Tammy.  And I'm Big A.  Jesus.  Jesus. 
[01:45:30]  Starting with our top.  Jesus.  You can breathe.  For me.  Chief of.  Give it up.  President Bush is.  Can you tell the writers, really, write this for him?  He looks around the room like, could someone please help me? 
[01:46:00]  Help me.  Stomping for his plans.  Yeah, don't look around for help.  The only thing that would help you is the same thing that helped our bud Dwyer.  This is one lousy paragraph.  He's been at it a minute and a half.  Wow.  That was a good one. 
[01:46:30]  Well, he just saw the Almond Joys.  Oh, he freaked out.  Yeah.  He just saw the Almond Joys and jestered to Jimmy like, give me the bag, give me the bag.  But he made some weird noise.  He can't resist.  And by the way, Big A is still trying to get another ST word out.  Yeah, I believe it's stopped.  The flow of immigrants jumping into the U.S. 
[01:47:00]  President Bush.  Let him go.  He said U.S. instead of United States, and the boys are calling him on it.  Oh, my God.  We're only to there?  The President Bush stopped by the border yesterday.  He once ate National Guard troops. 
[01:47:30]  Are you surfing?  Art.  I'm surfing to attention.  The Orange opponents of the Plans still want to stymie the President.  Stymie?  You guys are bastards, man.  Aiding the Bushes using the sticky issue as a stunt. 
[01:48:00]  Tearing attention away from his tumbling pole.  Statistics.  Oh.  My God, man.  Well done.  That was the first story?  Yes.  You are a wreck.  You're delicious.  Very good.  All right, Twitchell.  You're good.  The defense for one of the three Duke University lacrosse players charged with jumping an exotic 
[01:48:30]  dancer at an off-campus team party asked the judge Thursday for access to a cell phone  that the woman carried that night.  In addition, the defense for the sophomore Reed Seligman, 20, of Essex Fells, New Jersey,  said...  No, he didn't. 
[01:49:00]  He'd sound like an idiot.  Did he really go...  That's exactly what he said.  He said...  He wants to jumpstart...  ...the trial so he can return to school.  He argued that Seligman had established...  ...what we think is a pretty clear alibi. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Back to this.  Put them, Paul.  You move them right out of the way.  You put them where you can get them.  Don't you want an Almond Joy there, Twitchells?  They're all over.  Sure would not.  All right.  These are delicious.  God, they're good.  They really are.  I wonder if you can't stop.  I can't stop either.  And he shoves the whole thing in his mouth.  Yeah, of course.  He's just like...  He's just very needy.  Yeah.  You are very needy.  You're a needy person. 
[01:50:00]  Do you need...  Are you in need of, like, love and stuff?  Is that part of this whole thing?  The OCD, the Tourette's?  Are your parents supportful in supporting your career?  My parents are the most lovable, very supportive parents that a child could have.  That's what I'm being interviewed right now with those Woody Allen glasses and the fake  mustaches.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's go, big guy. 
[01:50:30]  Trekkies.  Oh, boy.  Cut.  Go bidding.  Auction's over by the time you're done with this story.  Pissies.  Everything has been sold.  Here's to buy the mop that the guy's cleaning up with.  Meanwhile, Twitchell's bid on everything because he was sitting in the room.  Well, here's 300. 
[01:51:00]  Ba-la-la-la-la.  All right.  Brr!  Right.  Sold for 48,000.  No!  50.  I don't have that kind of...  55.  Five.  All right, big guy.  Buy a phaser and shoot yourself.  All right, big A.

[02:24:00]  That New York is known for  That awful just straight faced walk  With their Borg instruments in their ear  Everyone's got that blue light  Do you need the light?  Do you need the red or blue flashing light?  Just because it looks cool  It's like an old movie  With an old computer system  That has lights all over it  I'm just saying those  Fucking the bluetooth things  Do they need the light?  They're all lit up 
[02:24:30]  Like they're so high tech  Like they want it to look futuristic  That you have this Uhura thing  Sticking out of your ear  And you need a light on it?  It's like the movie  When they have an explosive  On the bottom of a car  With a switch  And it always needs a light  To let you know  That it's on  Well I think the bluetooth light  Is just to let you know  That it's on  Thank you  It's stupid  It's pretty  Enough with the lights  Do you know what I was thinking too?  Yes sir  When you made a comment  That um  Are you eating Twitchell's candy? 
[02:25:00]  Oh  What's wrong with you?  Out of way  When you call me Miller Huggins before?  Yes  Thank you Kenny  I know what you want to be  What?

[02:26:00]  That walk sucked today huh?  I said that when you guys  Were uh jerking each other off  In the bathroom  I said that the walk  Was a little lackluster today  I think weather wise  It stinks  People are doing that fast walk  To get to wherever they are  They don't want to be  Interfered with  It's not one of those nice  Girls aren't wearing things  A little revealing  That we could comment on  No one smiles  I know  No one smiles  I'm sure you said some of this  But no one smiles  They all have like you said  An iPod or some kind of  Some kind of device  They're communicating  So important  What happened years ago? 
[02:26:30]  What did we do years ago  When you just walked to  Like to work  Or down the sidewalk  I don't know  You couldn't listen to anything really  No you had your  Transistor radio  I was going to say  You had your transistor radio  And the Yankees  Are in my  K-1  So we  What?

Get the boss's spoon 
[02:27:00]  Getting lippy over there  Jimmy  By the way  We're done with Twitchels  We did that for MTV today  We're done with Twitch  Are you throwing him  To the wayside  As they say?  We're done with you  Big A's the real star  Yeah you know  They ought to do that  Segment on Big A  Because I think  There's a lot more  Horrible things  Going on there  I noticed by the end  Of that segment  That the guy from MTV  Excuse me  MTV was just filming  Big A  Big A  Most of the time 
[02:27:30]  Like he's bringing that  Tape back to MTV  Going  I found a gold mine  Oh yeah  Gonna go back with this  Where Twitchels go?  Smoking  Hopefully jumped off the building  I thought  Aren't they doing  Off the roof  Aren't they doing stuff though?  Aren't they like  Gone from the show now?  Aren't they going  And doing MTV stuff?  I would hope so  Probably  There really isn't  Alright  That tank is dry  You know  Sometimes we gotta just  Kind of throw people  Off the ONA train  That's right  No matter where we are 
[02:28:00]  No matter how fast it's rolling  No matter how much it hurts  Off you go  He'll come up with a new tick though  Just to get back on the show  You watch  You think?  Oh yeah  You say tomato  He goes tomato  Boy that is a weird twitch  Come on in  Tomato  Tomorrow  And I want my new name  To stick by the way  Jimmy  Miller Huggable  But that  It's cute  But it needs a Jimmy  Alright  That's faggot and stupid 
[02:28:30]  Forget it  Let's see  Yes  Redrum6  Is showering  Oh my  She's so fucking sexy  She does this the same time  Every day  I guess  On Pal Talk  And she's got a camera  In her shower  And she just showers  For everybody  But she does it  The right way  She shows you the whole shower  She's just naked  No teasing  Teasing might sound good  On paper  Yeah  But in live  It stinks  I hate when they take off  Panties and go  Tee  And wander off

[02:30:00]  Would get out your  Big fat black wallets  Uh not you Jimmy  We all know yours  Is small and hairless  Yeah  And uh  Bet on  Who had the most  Dumps this week  Well  I think we kept  Kept track  No I'm sure we got  All the dump reports  But  Looking at this  Jimmy wins  For the week  Jimmy wins  For the week  Yeah  There's a couple  There's two of them  Here I have a big problem  But one I can certainly  Well let's see 
[02:30:30]  Let's wait  Because we need the  Opening intro  We need to sound like  A well polished radio  Like a machine  Ope  Hit it Derek  Live from the  Opie and Anthony  Show Studios  The Daily Dump Report  Here it is  O&A dumps  From our  FM radio program  For this Friday  May 19th  Right  Yeah  You should know  That date  Yeah  May 19th  06  First one  At 627 AM 
[02:31:00]  It's a day of love  The line  They were forced  To do it  Since they were five  That is Norton  During discussion  During a sexual  Asian massage  Child reference  During a sexual discussion  Completely wrong  That reference  Was when I was talking  About how they actually  Give a good massage to  And I was  I was talking about  How they're forced  To give massages  Since they were five  It wasn't even in  A sexual context  I know  I was actually saying  That's why  I said they're not  Trained masseuses  I don't think they went  To school 
[02:31:30]  But they're forced  To do it since they were five  Meaning give massage  It was nothing  But I will tell you why  The entire conversation  Did include  The girl giving you  A massage  And then giving you  Some type of sexual release  It did  But  So now  When you bring in  The child  Even though  What you meant  Was just the massage part  Because of the  Previous discussion  See it's gotten to the point  With the FCC  Where it's not just  What is said  It used to be what's said  Now you gotta 
[02:32:00]  Look at what you said  Based on what you said  Ten minutes ago  And if it can be  Tied together  You're in trouble  I know  But I still disagree  I understand why  He dumped it  But he was wrong  On that one  To dump that one  I think you should have  Said three  Yes I agree  Instead of five  Hold on man  Yes  Chris in New York  What's up  Bottle of water  Opie  Yeah  Didn't the great  Sainted Mrs. Hughes  Teach you not to talk  With food in your mouth  Yeah  I can never tell 
[02:32:30]  When aunt's eating  I can never tell  When little Jimmy's eating  I don't eat  Anthony doesn't eat  He weighs 50 pounds  At this point  I eat a bagel  In the morning  And then when I get home  I eat  Jimmy and I have to eat  The entire morning  Anthony  Anthony nibbles on a little bagel  And drinks a little club soda  And he's good for the day  Opie's metabolism  Like spins fucking plates  And juggles at the same time  It's like this delicate ecosystem  Opie's got a rainforest  Inside of him  You fuck up one little  One little kinkachu  And the whole fucking 
[02:33:00]  Forest dies  I'm measuring my protein  My carbs  All morning long  Anthony just nibbles  On a bagel  He's good  I need a bagel  When I get to work  In the morning  That's it  Once I get home  Then I eat  I have like a yogurt  And a banana  And then I have a bowl  Of raisin bran  And then I might have  A thing of  Progresso soup  And then I'll eat  With the chef maid  Some type of chicken  With vegetables  Rolls either in a wrap  Or some kind of thing  And then I go to sleep  And then I dreamy dream 
[02:33:30]  Dreamy dream  Not yet  Dream  Alarm's off  Shit  Time to fucking get up  My god  It's still last night  Oh we have fun coming today  Why don't you remind me  Ah you ate  Like I wanted kashi  You ate that shitty  Kashi cereal  And we have  Luscious food coming  Why don't you remind me  Yeah why don't you remind  The boss hawk  You're a  Hawk  E-rock  You're a non-reminder  You're a non-reminder  At 6.41am  We have 
[02:34:00]  Sorry Chris  For the loud chewing  By the way  Hey when's that food  Coming Eric  About 10  10.30  10.30  We're leaving at 11 today  Why is it so late  So you tell Mr. Food Guy  To get his ass over here  Pronto  I want to  I want to address  John in New York  Look at the John  What do you say John  Even before we finish  With the dumb cheek  What has Ben got though  Funny funny scene  In the men's room  Twitchell's in there  Taking a dump  With some black guy  From down the hall  He's going  Bling bling  So Derek and I  Are in there like jump  He's hitting his head  On the stall 
[02:34:30]  On the back of the door  Sorry  It's funny  Funny to me and Derek  Funny  Yeah  What's wrong Jimmy  I want to defend  The fact that Ben  Moves like Rodney Dangerfield  When he talks  You're okay  No respect  You know  You're okay  Hey I got to tell you  Twitchell's was taking a dump  You know  Boston  Hey Pronto  Why dude  Why  John  What's up 
[02:35:00]  Happy birthday Jimmy  Thanks a lot man  I felt a lot of people  Were concentrating on Anthony  Selfishly mentioning his anniversary  During my birthday  A day of love for Anthony  Horrific anniversary  Stop it  It's a day of love  A day that will live in  For me  Sorry Ant  Yeah I was just wondering  You know  Those of us who have been  Listening a long time  Know about Al Dukes  And it seems like his  Dump finger is getting  A little heavy  At what point are we  Going to be calling him  In the studio  Tell him to watch his ass  Now it may seem like that 
[02:35:30]  John  I'll be honest with you  We on the other hand  Are pushing further  See when we first got there  We were very sweet  And innocent  And a lot of people  Bitched about it  But we know the process  Of broadcast radio  So now we're actually  Getting into discussions  And pushing a little more  And seeing where  These boundaries are  It's a process  A learning process  And that is what you're seeing  Oh okay  Yeah  And some of these dumps 
[02:36:00]  Getting heavier and heavier  I gotta be honest  I'm surprised  With what we're getting away with  A lot of stuff  A lot of stuff  We're completely getting away with  There's stuff I'm saying  On a daily basis  That I'm sure  Is going to get dumped out of  And it doesn't  Right  Oh sorry  Yeah that's okay  Continue sir  I actually  Had an alterio motive  For asking  I just want to see  How Deuce gets shit on  I kind of missed that  Alright  We're avoiding him  To be honest with you  I've nodded to him so far  Because he's now  A big wig over there  When we knew him  He was nothing 
[02:36:30]  Now I guess he's got  A title and everything  He's got some kind of title  Alright  Almost an executive  Alright thank you guys  Have a good day  Alright John  Thank you  6.41am  It was  Getting whacked off  By hookers every day  That was a caller  Referencing Norton's  Asian massage  Oh so that wasn't Norton  No  I wouldn't say that  Getting whacked off  By a hooker  Every day  I would do it  Now this a little odd  This is too bad  Because this was really funny  742 
[02:37:00]  Let me read the explanation  A wet ker splat  Was dumped out  Now Norton  During discussion  Of strip search  In prison  After playing tape  Of Tyra Banks  Undressing  Squatting and coughing  He commented  What would fall out  As a result of  Getting naked  Squatting and coughing  A wet ker splat  I would like to hear  The exact context  What you said before that  Did you say  What would fall out  Yeah I was saying  Drug balloons 
[02:37:30]  Uh huh  How is that not allowed  To say drug balloons  Would fall out  That's what the purpose  Of them is  I think you said  Drug balloons  After the wet ker splat  Yeah but it doesn't matter  See but it does  Because he doesn't know  You're going to say  Drug balloons  You don't know  What that is  Yeah  If it's so thing  You have no idea  What it is  Until I say it  A wet ker splat  I know all about  The context  Of the discussions  But on these two  I disagree  The next one  I can agree with  I want to know  What the context  Was on that  Oh Dan  We're going to  Danny's going to pull it  Oh Danny's going to 
[02:38:00]  Pull what  The audio for the context  Oh  I thought  Pull his pud  Yes  Right  That would have been  Dumped out of by the way  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah because  I'm just trying to  Figure out why  749  Or on each other  That got dumped out  Of Norton  After playing a tape  Tyra Banks  Saying that  Prisoners have to go  To the bathroom  In front of each other  And then  Norton followed up  With  Or on each other  It's amazing how that  I can understand  Why they dumped it  But it's like  Jesus Christ  I know  They're so gun shy 
[02:38:30]  Is what it is  Holy shit  The FCC has really  Gotten radio companies  So scared  I really want  A democrat to win  Yeah but a lot of people  Will point out that  The FCC  The one that gave us  The hardest time  Was appointed by  Bill Clinton  Understandable  But I also believe  It was a democrat  That was in there  He didn't give us  A hard time  When Clinton was there  It was shit rolls  Downhill  Yeah  It's all  We all know  The boss's mood  Is what affects everything  And I think the fact  That the boss  Is a religious conservative  Is what's pushing people  So on this one 
[02:39:00]  And I really want to see  A democrat  Fair enough  Fair enough  Fair enough  Fair enough  Fucking conservative  Religious ideology  At 8.10am  They should film you  Jerking off  Now um  I knew  This was getting  Dumped out  And I knew  Opie knew  It was gonna get  Dumped out  Of when he said it  That was purely  For the MTV camera  And for the  XM radio audience  I'm trying to give  A little extra text  Which is fine  It was fine  I'm trying to give  A little text  They should film you 
[02:39:30]  Jerking off  Opie about MTV  Filming a guy  With Tourette's Syndrome  And those are your  Dumps for today  I've decided to be  The guy that just  It's not a gray area  I've decided every day  I'm just gonna have  The obvious dump  The black and white dumps  Right  That's what Opie has  When did Tom Hanks  Become a fat meathead  It's for the role  I think  Well the haircut was  What happened  Why is he a big fat meathead  He's a big dude man  Look at him compared  To like Regis  He's a  How big is he  Well Regis is tiny though  Regis walks around 
[02:40:00]  The hood  And he can't be  More than 5'5  5'6  We were  Me and my girlfriend  Were talking about  How actors turn into  Completely different people  After years go by  And she pointed out  That women  Get old  And men  Get fat  That seems to be  Why you change  Into something different  You watch an old  Star Trek episode  James T. Kirk  Coming onto the bridge  Bridge  He comes out  And it's young Shatner  Spelt  He's dead 
[02:40:30]  That Shatner  Is dead  He no longer exists  I don't know where  His tombstone is  I'd like to visit it  But he's gone  Because the new guy  That you see on the  Priceline commercials  Boston  Whatever that is  Boston Legal  That's not him  It's a totally  Different guy  Doesn't look  Anything like him  Different entity  Because he's all  Bloated  And I don't know  What happens to him  They turn into  Different people  And women  Just get like  You know  I feel bad for them 
[02:41:00]  They get old  They try to fix things up  Like Terry Hatcher  Just saw her the other day  In a great movie  Called Tango and Cash  By the way  We should play some clips  From that show  Movie  Because it's fantastic  And she was in that  Some good laughs  And she still looks good  On that desperate  Housewives thing  But they kind of  Slap the makeup on her  And stuff  Because you see her  In the tabloids  When she's coming out  Taking her garbage out  And that time's a bitch  Yeah  They become different people  Yeah 
[02:41:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I'm tired  If you're not  Wake up  Hold on  Is Twitchell here  I can't believe  We might have to  Get him into the studio  No  There's been something  Sitting in front of us  For a long time  And maybe we should  Clean up this  Some of this junk  Jimmy Norton  Teenage  God don't make no junk  Teenage Tourette's Camp  Oh  It's perfect  Unfortunately  It sounds fun  Twitchell's is here 
[02:42:00]  So how about we listen  To some audio  From Teenage Tourette's Camp  Did you watch this show?  I've heard a lot about it  Is it British or something?  Actually I think Australian  Okay  Same difference  I think a couple of people  Are suggesting  We throw a towel  Over Twitchell's head  So he thinks it's night time  And shuts up  I love that

[02:43:30]  We've seen him clean shaven  He exfoliated  That's what it looks like right?  Got a facial or something  Where's your MTV cameraman?

[02:44:00]  Shut up  She's a polished voiceover doer  I know  Do you know how many squat and coughs  In that institution  Probably wind up with a wet ker splat  With a balloon full of drugs  I don't know how that got in there  Alright  See  How many squat and coughs  End up with a wet ker splat  With a balloon full of drugs  Yeah but that comes after  That's like  That's like when someone gives you directions  And goes 
[02:44:30]  Take the turn before maple  You don't know till you're past it  Like he hit it  And then hearing the other thing  Might not have hit it  If you said it before  But a wet ker splat  I didn't say anything coming out  Until the drug line was there  Squat and thrust result  In a wet ker splat  Is  Come on  Yeah but  He's got to think like  Ant saying like this  Like yeah  He doesn't know your drug reference  Is coming  He can't go about  Wet ker splat could mean  Anything wet  And gooey

Because it was fun and entertaining 
[02:49:30]  What is he doing with the mousetraps?  What their whole little spin is  That some mousetraps will have money  A mouse on the bottom  Some will have  Oh mother  Strip for one  A little twist on it  See it's such a fine line  Mother fucker  So some have money on the bottom  What would you have me do sir?  Just wait for us to take over his slots everywhere  Jesus  Guy writes me an email

[02:50:30]  One hundred dollars  One hundred dollars  What's the broad doing?  Hey for a trap it's like  You're going to make two dollars  She's an intern  I don't know  A hundred bucks  Why are you doing it?  It was like a hundred dollars  And she was willing to play  Alright  So it's got to be  Reasonable  Reasonable  Alright you're talking to me here  You know I get paid  I don't know  Twenty dollars  Twenty dollars?  Just respect  That's my clothing  I have a reputation  It's my foot here 
[02:51:00]  Virgin  Twenty dollars  How about a buck or five bucks?  Not a buck  I thought you did that last buck  Twenty dollars per trap  How many articles of clothing do you have on total?

[02:52:00]  Teenage Tourette's camp  We move on to the second clip here  Well it is difficult  Because we find it difficult to go out for a meal  Because everybody is feeling a bit tense  Going to a restaurant can be difficult  Because Jessica will be tense  Because the family will be tense  And so we tend not to go out for meals 
[02:52:30]  Or on mass anymore  You can't do things  You can't do everything that you want to do  I don't know if you have a fat bitch  Nice  That's kind of hot  It's even better with the accent  Does it better?  The accent's cute  Here's something we got to think about  Does the whole family go to hell  Because they can't go to church  Because of Jessica?  Yes  Those are the rules  Well that's BS  That's BS  It never stopped my family from going to church  I would just sit in the back pew  Oh  How about they just leave her home  And then go out and have fun 
[02:53:00]  Fun fun  And come back and go  You missed a great night  And throw confetti in her cursing face  Here you go potty mouth  Throw the doggie bag at her  You have doggie bag full of what could have been  Isn't that ironic that you actually  Here you go can't be quiet  Isn't it ironic that Twitchell's actually goes to  You know went to church  Or goes to church with the family  And they put that  But meanwhile  Just a few hundred years ago  You'd have been burnt at the stake  And rightly so  Yeah well I'm glad I was fucked at the right time  You would have been  Witch  Witch 
[02:53:30]  Now you're not a witch  Now they would just go  Irritant  Irritant  Can I see the camera?  Burn him  Uh oh  Why?  Jimmy what are you doing?  What are you doing with the palto?  Jimmy's putting it  Why?  On his dick  Why are you plumping up?  What are you looking at that you're plumping up?  Why are you filling up?  You're in a room with a bunch of guys  Nothing to do with what's going on here  What are you just thinking?  Of course  Is it big A next to you?  Wait  Why?  Jimmy  There you go  Why do you have that in your pants? 
[02:54:00]  Wait where?  Wait where's the  Where is it?  You're loving that one on palto?  What are you thinking of that's got you like that?  Wait  Not that  Jesus Christ  Slush  That's not my pal  I don't want to see it on here  Where's your pal?  There's nothing pally about that  I'm going to have to bounce you  No don't bounce me  I'm your pal  Let's talk 
[02:54:30]  Oh my god  Can we go home?  This is really uncomfortable now  Can you at least say no homo?  No it's nothing to do with  What are you thinking of?  Something that happened  What happened?  Something that happened  Yeah  Years ago  What happened?  It was a young boy  I received an answering machine message  At a certain period of time that I saved  Yeah  And let's just say I listen to it occasionally  Can you bring it in?  Can't play it now  How long ago did you get it?  I don't remember  Hot though  Years or months? 
[02:55:00]  No no no  Matter of hours  Years, months, weeks, days  Weeks, within weeks  Within weeks  Okay  What was this answer?  And I would gather it's a sexually explicit  What was this message about you?  Message  No it was my father  Of course it was a sexually explicit message from a girl  I'm just trying to ramp into this  And I just was  Because you're not messing up  I was thinking of the wording of it  If you want to know  And it was just  It just hit me  Yeah  It was very dirty  Yeah  Was it phone sex 
[02:55:30]  On your answering machine?  No no  Nothing that cheesy  And the event didn't happen  It was just  The wording of the message  Yeah  It just drove me crazy  And still does  That's all you could give us?  Something along the lines of  Interesting  It was a place I was doing a show  I might even say what city it was in  Uh huh  And the message was  Cause somebody I know  Oh girl  I hope so  Talking about coming to the show  And uh like  You know I'd love to see you  It'd be great  And then she goes 
[02:56:00]  Uh  Maybe we could uh  Maybe we could sneak off  And go to the dressing room  And you could take out your cock  And I could suck it a little  Oh okay  And it fucking ruined me  And here's the beauty of  How awful my life is  Yeah  I didn't get the message  Until four o'clock in the morning  After the show  It's like World War II  With the Japanese diplomat  And the bombing of Pearl Harbor  You didn't get the message  Why wasn't this put through priority? 
[02:56:30]  Well first of all  My Verizon phone  Is a fucking  It's a box of cock meat  That should send you out  On a shooting spree  That fucking phone  Stinks  But it doesn't vibrate  When it should  It's a  I hate those  Fucking  Flat screen phones  I'm gonna get rid of it  It's a $500 phone  I figured  I haven't  I buy a phone  Every three years  I never buy phones  Yeah  And I wanted a good one  The fan has the same phone  The volume stinks 
[02:57:00]  The fucking  Those screen  Flat screen  Push buttons  Eat my asshole  Nah  You push it  And the fucking thing  Doesn't push  You need a real button  On a phone with buttons  Right  You need a button  Exactly  Like that  The Razor stinks  You need a button  The Razor does stink  Everyone bought into the Razor thing  And they stink  Cut your wrist with it  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Cleveland  Jeremy  Hey what's up boys  Hey Jeremy  Yeah listen  I tried to call Rover  And you know  Kind of let him politely know  That who who who 
[02:57:30]  You guys are getting ripped off by him  And the phone screener told me  That he wouldn't put anything  That mentions O and A through  Why  Why  Why  Because he's a fucking asshole  That's probably why  Rover's fucking scared of you guys  He's gotta rip off you  Cause he has no fucking material  Well the mousetrap thing's a little weird  I gotta be honest with you  No one was doing the mousetraps  And I  You know  We start sounding like  Telling Fred who  He was hearing  I have a little message for Rover  The company is paying  Very very very close attention  To what you're doing in Chicago 
[02:58:00]  Very very close attention  Fuck him  Later guys  Punch it out  So enjoy doing some of the things  That were very successful  On our show  Let's see how the ratings  Do for you in Chicago  Cause we're  We're in the bullpen buddy  I like Chicago  We want to be on a Chicago  My kind of town  We want to be in Chicago  To get the job done  Jimmy  Trying to do my show  Alright enough

[02:59:00]  He was thinking of the message  Well I heard the message yesterday  I saved it  Yeah of course  I'll play it for you  Alright let's play  We'll sit in a room together  Getting back to  Getting back to  Teenage Tourette's camp  Jessica  More Jessica  And also we found  That she  She  Didn't listen  And at one time  We thought  Perhaps she  Was deaf  So we had tests done on that  But  Obviously she wasn't  Well when I see people 
[02:59:30]  Like I sometimes  Say what I'm  Thinking about them  But I don't mean it  Kind of thing  Nigga  Nigga  Like that kind of  But I'm not racing  She's my subconscious  I just  Can't help it  And I feel really guilty  Is she driving down  The expressway  Nigga  Yeah  I think she's  Commuting home  She tries to cover up  Her Tourette's  By saying that  She says things  That she doesn't mean  Yeah  Meanwhile  When she sees a fat person  She uncontrollably  Starts yelling fatty  And when she 
[03:00:00]  Oh does she  Do you have clips of that  I believe so  Yeah  And when she  Please God  And when she sees  You know a black person  That's inevitably  She does  Truth  That's  Exactly  That's exactly what it is  Well I mean there is  Some truth to that  Same thing with me  And jump  When you think about it  You do it  But it's not  Now the difference is this  That's an OCD  Jump is a  Is not a natural  When you hear  I hear a word  Like jump  I don't want to jump  That's an OCD  Jump  I mean it feels good to jump  Of course it does  But when you see a fat person  And you yell fatty

[03:12:00]  Sam told waitress to fuck off  We were on a ferry to France  And I was shouting  I've got a bomb  We went  This was the same holiday  We went to a restaurant  And it was really bad  Ticking  And this young girl  Brought his meal to him  And he said  Thank you  Fuck off  And she like  Looked at him  And me  I just  I nearly died  And when she came back  When Sam had gone 
[03:12:30]  I said  I'm ever so sorry  He's got brain damage  I didn't know  Just how it came out  Brain damage  So my husband stopped  Talking to me then  Because of what I'd said  You are  And it just  I've got brain damage now  Have I  Just calm down  However  This is just what I said  But  It's just the things  That you say  Thanks  Yeah  You do have brain damage  What do you think  That's functioning well  When you're yelling  Pussy and fuck off  That's some type of problem there  Did we chase away  A female listener  I don't know 
[03:13:00]  Let's say hi to Bo  Maybe we can get her back  Bo in Arizona  Bo  Hey  How you guys doing man  My wife  Was listening earlier  You told Angela  You said  Your stupidity  Because you have a cunt  Instead of a penis  She looked at me  She says  I'm done with your boys  They're a bunch of women  Hating faggots  Oh no  Hey dude  We're just joking around  Look  How about this  We say a lot of dumb stuff  We did that to annoy her  Can we put your wife on  Because we will  Absolutely straighten out  We'll get her back  I just dropped her off 
[03:13:30]  At work man  But you know what  I told her the same exact thing  I said you know what  He was just trying to get her shit man  Get her all fucked her ass up  Call her on a three way  We will definitely straighten out  Because we get this flack a lot  Yeah  It's not to annoy all women  We understand  We love women  We have a relationship with them  Dude  We say something to one person  To annoy them  Yeah  And the other listeners  Oh man  Dude get her on three way  I love you again  Don't worry about it  No can you please  Have her call the show  So we can smooth this off  Call her on three way  Alright man  I'll see if I can get a hold of her  No Paul I'm not kidding  Please  We like settling this 
[03:14:00]  We don't want to lose our  XM listeners  Right now at work  I'm going to tell her to call you  Right now  Alright  Okay  Well we're on regular radio  We don't care if we lose a few  But XM we know you're paying for it  We don't want to lose a customer  What's her name  What's her name  He said he was going to call  And never call back  Okay  Because that's not good  Yeah it's like you say one thing  To one person  And so we're not talking about everybody  It's just to annoy the one person  Ew  Alright listen  We go to Jessica  Back to Jessica  This is the one that says  Bomb in airport  I said that last year didn't I 
[03:14:30]  I did say bomb in an airplane last year  If would I get arrested for saying that  No  Since she packs the bags  Is there any one of them  She's able to live at all  No they've been at my house all the time  Bomb  Bomb  Alright  Oh that's not good  Yeah that was her actually at the airport  Because this Tourette's camp  Is in the United States  And they're in England  So they're actually at the airport  Checking their luggage  And she starts going  Bomb bomb  She just wants attention  Anyone else seeing that 
[03:15:00]  Like the anorexic girl  She's just looking for attention  Yeah  That's right  Like that  That is  That's hell on earth  Well I've never really shouted out anything  You know like  Like you know  What Twitchell's has  That's hell on earth  But when someone just conveniently  Has to yell bomb in an airport  Stop  No I don't know  I gotta say  Why else would you yell niggers  Or fatty  It really isn't  It's almost like your mind says  What's the worst thing you can think of  At any given moment  It's like a weird bizarre 
[03:15:30]  You ever think things like that  All the time  What's the worst thing I can do in this situation  Usually happens in church  If you're sitting there during a wedding  Or worse yet  A funeral  And you think  What if I just got up  And started like doing a little tap dance  In front of the casket  And you start like laughing  To yourself  And it's horrible  Yeah absolutely  Or you're like  What if I just fucked it  And you realize you're jerking off  You take it to a whole new level  No but I  I would be at the table  At my grandmother's house  And I would just think of saying  Cunt soft  Pest  The fucking soft 
[03:16:00]  Like the worst thing  You can think of  They just don't have that impulse control  So I don't think it's a tension  Because so many times  You say things that are like  Can truly put you in danger  Like they're just like  You're going to get your teeth knocked out  You ever see someone  Standing at the edge of the subway platform  And think you could just  Push them off  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Man I could just like  Walk up and push them right off  I've done it  Grab those stroller handles  And shove away  There you go  18 years of problems solved  Uh oh  Man finds alligator lurking in pond  Kill it 
[03:16:30]  Kill it  It's a little guy  Please rape it  They should get  They should get this Jessica girl  To just go to a Rich Vosch show though  And just sit in the audience  Bob  Bob  Bob  Bob  How are you  Bob  Bob  Can I buy you a camp  Alright more Jessica  I got a tick  Is this true  Jessica likes to tug at steering wheels  This is part of her Tourette's  Oh boy  I think it goes  I mean I think it fits into  Exactly what Ant's talking about  Where you just think of  The one thing  That you're just shooting  That's awful 
[03:17:00]  And then you end up doing it  Yeah cause you're driving  Like 80 miles an hour  You think of just turning  Head on into a car  I've still  You ever think of  When you're driving  What would happen  If I just turn my ignition off  I think of that all the time  As I'm driving  What would happen  If I just turned it to the left  And stopped it  Would I lose control  Of the power steering  I don't know if you could  Can you do that  We could try that on  Mythbusters with lawsuits  There you go  Whenever I'm in restaurants  I usually have the urge  You know in a buffet  Spitting the food  Oh just spitting the food  That used to be a thing with mine 
[03:17:30]  I always wanted to do it  I would think about spitting  Spitting spitting spitting food  Do you think there are Tourette's people  That have that idea  And do it  The difference between me  And the other people  Is that I can control it to a degree  Never eat a fucking buffet  You don't like buffets  Never  Why  Because they are disgusting  Food  And bacteria  Tubs  Would you eat in a buffet  In like a deli  A deli buffet  Where filthy people  Are roaming around  With their feet uncovered  They keep it  Picking vegetables out  With their toes 
[03:18:00]  They keep it clean  Animals  No  Sometimes you have to  Lick off the spoon  Before you put it back  But besides that  People are slobs by nature  Selfish  Think they're the only person  On earth slobs  And they sneeze  On their hands  They  What was that  There was something  We were watching on the news  The other day  About bacteria  And there's more bacteria  On the food you eat  Than toilet bowls  Or some shit like that  I remember my friend  My friend  Dean  And I 
[03:18:30]  I think  And Jimmy  All spit on a public pay phone  And I mean  Hocked goobers  All over the ear part  Oh god  And the mouth part  And we were all standing there  And this  This black guy  Picked at the phone  And put it to his ear  And got fucking  Godless spit in his ear  And we were laughing  We were ten feet away  We had no subtlety  And the guy's like  Who the fuck did that  So me and Jimmy  Just pointed at Dean  And what he did  And fucking the guy  Chased him  We were young  Did you say  Leave him alone  Leave him 
[03:19:00]  No  So he all said that about me  Leave him alone  You're an awful person  Let's get a sad  In Tennessee  Sad  What's happening fellas  Hey sad  Hey man  I'm gonna just say  Twitch is a damn  Fucking genius man  Why is he a genius  I love that guy  I don't know  Where you find these people  If it's made up or what man  But keep rolling with that man  Well we wanna find new freaks  We definitely wanna do that  Are you still doing American Mess  We tried  It didn't work too well  Maybe we could bring American Mess 
[03:19:30]  To the  To the terrestrial radio side  Yeah  Because we have a greater  Concentration of listeners  In New York  When we do the first half  Of the show  Any picture  Gary in Cleveland  Look him  Hey  Hey Gary  I think you said it  Anthony  When I was younger  I used to sit in church  And I'd just sit there  And go  Fuck you Jesus  Fuck you Jesus  I felt horrible  Yeah you feel horrible  You try to get it out of your head  And then you just can't  They're just horrible thoughts 
[03:20:00]  You'd get  I had to say  I thought I was such a wacko  But I got  It wasn't even like church  All the time  It was  My sister used to do  These little recitals  She was in like ballet  And she'd do that  And we'd have to  Go to these recitals  So she'd be on stage  With a bunch of other  You know  They're little girls  And they're doing  Their little recital  And I would think  What would happen  If I ran up on the stage  And just started  Punching the girls in the face  Like one by one  Just bam bam  Punching them in the face  What  Like what would be  The chain of events  What would happen 
[03:20:30]  Before someone would stop me  Like if I did this right now  It would ruin my career  Or it would ruin my life  Right  Here it is  In a moment  You can just wreck everything  And you have complete free will  To do it  I would say words  That sound like the words  Oh shucks  Because I like the fuck  Sound  I think I had a mild Tourette's  When I was growing up  Yeah  I had twitches and stuff  Not like you do  I see you twitching  Every now and then  I told you that  It doesn't twitch as much  As it used to  John in Ohio  Yeah  I just spin in a circle  Once to the right  John  That's stupid  It's true  It is just plain silly  Dizzy goose 
[03:21:00]  Wah wah penis  John in Ohio  Yeah this is John  Hey Jimmy  I wanted to tell you  What happens  When you turn the key off  Going down the road  Man  The steering wheel  Not only  Do you lose your power  Steering  But the steering wheel  Locks  I know it does lock  Right  I don't believe  You can do that  Unless the car is in park  Yeah you can turn the key off  With it  With it in gear  I don't think you can  I don't think you can 
[03:21:30]  Stop it  No you can't  What's wrong with you  Somebody try this then  Go to a parking lot  No no  Parking lot where it's safe  Not driving right now  Just try it  No  No  No  Do it  Do it  Do it  No do it in a parking lot  Go to a parking lot  Where it's safe  Do it  Maybe if you own  A 52 Rambler  Maybe then I would say  You can do that  But in any newer car  With any safety feature  Whatsoever  You don't think  They build that  Fucking feature in  That accidentally  You shut your ignition off  And everything locks up on you 
[03:22:00]  Stop it  You can't turn the key  Try it  You can't  Alright John  Let's get back to Tourette's camp  I know  I know  I know  Thank you  I could see  What was Hawk bugging you  No he's not  I'll take care of Hawk right now  So Jessica likes to tug at steering wheels  Let's listen to this clip  She has compulsions  For example  The worst one is  Is opening car doors  When the car's running  Ah  Well it's running 
[03:22:30]  That's a problem  Could be  If she sits in the front of the car  She will tend to pull at the steering wheel  Could be a blessing  Can be a problem  As you can imagine  Can be a problem  If we go to a restaurant  She prefers that the candles aren't anywhere near us  Because I'll touch them  But I actually  I'm alright with candles  I put the flame out  I'll help  Scooch  And she used to be worried about having steak knives  Now that's only in a restaurant  Not at home or any other place  But for some reason  Being in the restaurant with a sharp knife  She didn't like it 
[03:23:00]  Because she kept on wanting to prod the end  So those are the  Those sort of things  Um  Happen  I can't  Those are the sort of most  The ones I think can be called  Bored  Was she yelling there at the end?  She's yelling bored  I thought so  Bored  Ah bored  We need her in this studio sometime  She was just saying what the whole audience is saying right now  Bored  Bored  If I was the parent of a kid like that  My right arm would be muscular from backhands  Grabbing the wheel  Ya crack 
[03:23:30]  Ya crack  Can we please get somebody with Tourette's  Like who has the yelling  Not that we want to replace you  But I mean someone that yells shit  Yeah  I want a Tourette yeller  Well I told you  The one kid  Shut up  Shut up  The one kid I met  Shut up  All right  Say what you have to say  I'm sorry  What kid  What kid  The one kid  Shut up  Oh my god  We ran right into that one  Right already

I agree with everything you say except me getting down on myself for not being funny.  Exactly.  I know I'm hysterical.  I get down on myself for not being that funny.  That's right.  And we get down on Opie for the same reason.  Hey, Jason.  All right, dude.  Fudge it out, man.  Hey, Jason.  You don't have to laugh that hard.

[03:42:00]  Through June 3rd.  For tickets and info, call the box office, 212-560-8912.  It says that you released a DVD live at Wembley.  You did a gig at Wembley Stadium?  Mm-hmm.  How many people?  Two.  We played The Booth next door.  Hold on.  Food Guy is out of here.  Hey, we can use the name, right?  That's funny.  But, uh...  No, I don't know how many, sir.  I think there was about 10,000, but they were all family. 
[03:42:30]  Wow.  They all came down.  Food Guy's leaving.  Good.  Do we have to plug Food Guy?  Yeah.  What's the name of this swill?  I don't know.  We're...  It's like our eating interview.  Now, everybody enjoy your food?  Yes.  Everything's great?  Excellent.  If you guys need anything, call me over at Boca.  We're on 50th.  Ah.  Boca?  135, 50th.  You guys take care of Ron and Fez, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've heard Ronnie sit back there and go,  I like the Boca. 
[03:43:00]  Good thing you didn't bring any soda.  I like the Boca to Fez.  All right.  Yeah, and if you need anything, answer Brian.  That's me.  I'll take care of you guys.  Brian at Boca.  I need a soda.  You need a soda?  Well, send someone out to get it.  That's not his responsibility.  All right.  We're going to get one of the interns to get me a diet Coke.  Thank you, sir.  You want a beverage, Lee?  Bye, Brian.  You want a beverage?  No, I've got to be honest.  I ate there once.  Yeah?  And I was like...  You didn't like it?  No, I just shit my pants.  But I didn't want to say because he was in the room,  but now he's out.  Now it's cool.  Now that we're all eating this. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, man.  You know, to me and the toilet, we were friends.  What's the camera for us?  Make it...  Is this like...  You're really nervous.  We really want to be on television.  Oh, do you?  So we do radio, but we fake that we're on television.  That camera's not even rolling?  Yeah, there's no tape in it or anything.  We like to look important like we might be doing something.  Oh, yeah.  Because look how ridiculously big it is.  You can do the same thing with a palm cord these days,  but then we wouldn't feel like television.  That's like on his shoulder like it's 1983.  That camera right there is on you, though.  That's pal talk.  It's where people talk in these chat rooms on video. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, it is?  And you can see it on Anthony's screen over there.  Oh, my lord.  Yeah, we got girls.  Sometimes they'll show their tits.  It's lovely.  Us and you.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, on the camera?  Yeah, live right now as we speak.  Point...  Pick one out like maybe...  Oh, no.  This is like porn.  Would any girl please flesh your breasts?  Well, no.  Have a very...  Heavily point to one of the girls.  Which one do you want?  This one.  He's pointing to himself.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  No, this is porn.  I'm not allowed.  I'm from a religious cult.  And I'm not allowed to do this sort of thing.  I have to go and see my guide now.  A religious cult?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's going to tell me that I've done wrong.  I didn't think they were that strict.  Oh, they're very strict.  Look at my shirt.  It looks ripped.  He tore me to pieces.  Yeah.  That's a shirt that looks ripped.  I know.  But it's actually made like that.  That's actually an extra.  You pay extra for the...  Yeah.  For the lion kind of...  They put you in a room with...  It made you look like you were mauled. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  But, wow, you point on a screen and that's...  Does their mom and dad know that they're doing this?  I don't think so.  My lord.  They can hear you talking also.  Like you say, hey, show us your tits and they'll do it.  No, keep your clothes on.  So, keep them on.  Certainly.  Hey, this whole thing with Paul McCartney there and his new soon-to-be ex-wife.  Is that big news over there in England?  In England?  Yes, it is.  That's like on the level of like... 
[03:45:30]  I think it's...  What here?  Big everywhere.  Yeah.  Like Britney dropping her baby big?  Yes.  Britney, yeah.  Because that seems to be like big news here for some fucking reason.  It's on the cover of the Daily News.  Oh, man.  Do people understand there's a war on?  Well, there was a woman also in England that had her baby stolen from the bottom of her bed.  So, just as I left, it wasn't me.  Are you admitting?  Yeah.  No, no.  But I kind of thought they should leave the umbilical cord on because then it would sort  of solve that problem.  Why cut it?  Why cut it?  You've got a great plan there. 
[03:46:00]  You can't run down the road with a woman dragging behind you.  I just don't know.  It's just a thought, really.  And then when they get a little older...  Yeah.  ...then you cut it.  Well, you could...  Well, no, leave it on.  How long?  Until you die and just drag a corpse.  I don't know.  You've got to be with your mum.  This is my mum.  You're 35 years old, dragging her to job interviews.  Yeah, but her mother would be there.  It would just be a string of old ladies.  Oh, a big string of old...  Yeah, just like a...  Wow!  You're trying to fuck the one good-looking one on the end.  Yeah.  It's like a charm bracelet of old people. 
[03:46:30]  4,000 people attached to it.  We all got to get on the bus.  That's horrible.  Yeah.  But it would open up like a clothing line just for the court.  Yeah, I just want to say something.  One of those ladies on that screen is my wife.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Which one was one?  That's nice.  I hope it's one of the cute ones.  Yes, it is.  That's the one Opie points out as ugly.  But we don't identify who it is.  Okay.  So they never know.  They feel good.  It's like at the firing squad where one guy gets a magazine with no bullets in it.  So you can always have that element of a doubt. 
[03:47:00]  The girls we go see like her right there.  She's ugly.  But they all...  She's just ruined our whole life.  No, no, but she doesn't know that it's her.  Because there are so many girls up on the screen that they all go, it can't be me.  Like that one I'd sleep with, that one I'd sleep with, and that one I'd kick in the mouth  if she spoke to me.  She looks like she's already been kicked in the mouth.  Did she speak to you one time?  You know there are girls that absolutely know we're not talking about them. 
[03:47:30]  But then you know there's girls that go, are they talking about me?  And then there's some girls that go, oh, I just know they're talking about me.  I know it's me.  Why don't we just say it?  No, don't say it.  Don't be hurtful.  Please.  Because they're here sharing.  I think the internet is all porn anyway.  I mean, you only have to log on just to get your email, and it just comes up.  Cock extension vibe.  And you think...  It's like the search engines have got Tourette's.  Yeah.  You know, because anything you type in, it'll relate back to porn.  Cabbages. 
[03:48:00]  See, the guy with loads of carrots up his ass.  And it comes up on your screen.  You can't get rid of it.  We've talked about that before, where you actually have, believe it or not, a legitimate  thing to look up on the internet.  Yeah.  And 10 minutes later, at most, you're on porn, and you have no idea what you were looking  up, or why, or how.  And it was something very important.  Here's an example.  Dude, get Google.  Type in cunt catchers.  I bet something comes up. 
[03:48:30]  I bet something really innocent comes up.  Like, ah, pappages.  Guerrilla rap.  Well, the Urban Dictionary comes up.  That'll be it.  Yeah, but it's usually when you're trying to do something serious.  Yeah, that's right.  Once in a blue moon.  And that, you know...  You get lost in it, right?  You just kind of, oh, wait a minute, let me see that.  You're kind of following this roadway, and you're taking turns, and all of a sudden,  how did I end up here?  I know, and it's like Dante's Inferno.  It just drags you down, and it gets worse and worse, and then there's like people kind  of, you know, there's like feces involved, you know, and you're like, where did I get 
[03:49:00]  here?  I was looking up, like, a word.  And then some Asian girl is standing behind a man in a bridal gown shitting in her face.  There you go, yeah.  And I'm not even making that up.  Yeah.  That's when you look up hot images.  And then when you're trying to do something, this also pisses me off.  When you're just fucking around, you're bored shitless, you're on the internet, you're just  watching videos of kids shooting people with paintball guns from their cars.  Nothing to do.  Your computer works perfectly. 
[03:49:30]  The second you have to order something that has to be there tomorrow, it freezes up on  you, doesn't work, locks, computer just goes down.  Anything else that you're wasting time on works fine.  Perfect.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Connecticut.  Jeff?  Hey there, Jeff.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  We're on with Lee Evans.  Yeah.  I just want to say, yeah, he was on BBC America, his hour and a half stand up.  That is a funny son of a bitch.  And I've never seen anybody sweat so much in my life.  Oh, well, thank you very much indeed. 
[03:50:00]  I do sweat a lot.  I think it's nerves.  I get very nervous.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, great show though.  Really good.  Funny guy.  You still get nervous live?  It's very kind of you, sir.  Yeah, I do.  Getting out on stage.  I don't know what it is.  I think I'm slightly deficient in some way.  In some way?  Yeah, I suffer nerves very badly.  Yeah.  I do.  It's a great profession then.  But don't you like...  In front of everybody.  That's going to be crazy.  Yeah, I should be in bomb disposal or something.  Yeah, well, you're always nervous and you have a reason for it.  Don't you feel like really nervous before you've got to go on stage, but then once you're 
[03:50:30]  out there doing it, you loosen up?  Well, no, because I've got all this stuff roaming about in my head and I can't quite remember  it and I have no way of going through it.  You know, like some people go, oh, I remember eyes.  I think eyes and then I think getes, getes, you know, and I've got none of that.  There's no reference point.  No, none of that kind of...  I used to sing in bands and sometimes the music could start and I would go, holy shit,  I have no idea what the first line of this song is. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  And the music's going and going to intro music and it's time to kick in and the second  I'm supposed to sing, boom, it clicks in my head.  Yeah.  But the anxiety you get before that going, oh my God, I'm going to look like a fucking  idiot.  Here it comes, here it comes.  And you know exactly when you're going to look like an idiot because you know the song.  Yeah.  I've actually started jokes and like, I started a joke and I know right now I cannot say  the part, I cannot go to the end.  Oh.  But it's like your mouth is so accustomed to saying it, it just goes into that and you're  like, I told the joke and I didn't remember a fucking word. 
[03:51:30]  Right, right.  And you didn't know where it was going to end.  What about when it's over?  Do you like enjoy that you did it?  I'm so relieved.  Yeah.  I know I'm in the wrong job.  I don't know how I got here.  I started off in bands when I was in art college and stuff.  Yeah.  And it was all sort of punk and all that then, you know, and we just, the basic gig was  you'd walk on stage, someone spits at you, you'd dive at them and sort of smash the guitar  over there and everyone went, yeah, I like it.  And you went home, you know, that was the gig.  And no one give a shit about the music at all.  Right. 
[03:52:00]  It's all about what the people are seeing and just being around.  Yeah, we had a lead singer, this guy called David, and he was like an animal.  He had like no head.  He was just like this.  He just had a neck with eyes on it.  And he would just lunge at the crowd.  It was the opening number.  Blah!  Oh, we like these lot, you know, it's mad.  What are you doing with Richard Dreyfuss, man?  Are you doing the producers, is that here or in a...  No, we do, that was in England, in London.  Nice.  You guys are playing the two...  Oh, you sing? 
[03:52:30]  I, well, no.  It's in bands, but...  I asked if I could mime, but they, you know.  It's not like...  We don't mime in musicals.  The producers, it's not like, you know, Les Mis.  No.  Where you gotta like be a really good singer.  Yeah, and also, it's all that emotional stuff.  At least you can have some fun, you know.  If you're doing some comedy, you know what it's like.  But, you know, these sort of serious musicals,  I don't know how to go through the motions every night.  It's so kind of...  Yeah.  You know.  Constantly.  And it's not like every word is sung.  Like some of these things... 
[03:53:00]  What was that?  Some of them, they sing every word.  Some of the entire thing, and I think Les Mis is one of those,  where it's like,  I am here to say to you today  That I have walked a whole street length  To knock on your door and say...  All right.  All right.  Can you just talk about it and then, you know,  get to a song later?  Absolutely.  We'll understand it's a musical.  Everything they do.  I know, I know.  I saw somebody die in a musical once.  They stabbed them, and they went...  And I'm thinking, fuck, you wouldn't do that.  No way.  You fucking stabbed me.  You son of a bitch.  I am dying. 
[03:53:30]  Please call 911.  In London, you know, it's 999.  It takes fucking ages.  Is it?  One, nine.  Oh, ah, nine.  It should absolutely be 111.  I don't know who came up with the 999.  Nine.  The longest fucking thing.  You know, there's like some guy dying of heart attack.  Nine.  Nine.  Nine.  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  Yeah, it's like there, you know.  At least you got the nine, then the 11.  Yeah.  You get the long one out of the way at first.  Yeah, somebody went nine.  If you're still alive.  Oh, that's too long. 
[03:54:00]  We should do the 1-1 just to speed it up.  I think it's sort of like a triage.  A triage.  Here.  If you could get through the first nine, then we'll give you the easy one.  There you go.  If not, you're dead.  You probably wouldn't have made it anyway.  Yeah, it's like going through college, but on the phone.  Yeah.  Go to work and then the 1-1, okay?  Hey, let's say hi to Jim in South Carolina.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, Lee, I love your work.  I just wanted to ask you real quick who you're going for in the World Cup.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  The World Cup.  Who watches the World Cup?  Everyone but us. 
[03:54:30]  I know.  Everybody but us.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Half of the American.  If we're not watching, is there really a World Cup?  Can I ask?  Is soccer, how is it?  Is it big here?  Because I know American football's huge and baseball.  Yeah.  They've been trying to make soccer huge in America for decades.  It doesn't work.  It just doesn't work.  The American side, the soccer side, is rated fourth in the world.  They're amazing sides.  Who cares?  They're really good, though.  Are they?  I know you don't like it, sir.  I'm sorry.  You know what it is?  It's, I think, a lot of Europeans that live here.  Yeah.  And Mexicans, too.  Mexicans, too.  They come up. 
[03:55:00]  They love it.  During the finals, forget about it.  You see little Toyota Corollas with Brazilian flags tied to their hood all over the place.  They go nuts for it.  They go crazy by that.  No, I know what you mean, sir.  I couldn't.  We hear football and wear, you know, shoulder pads and helmets.  In Europe, they're nuts about it.  I mean, they fight you for it.  Well.  You know, if somebody sort of badmouths your side, then someone would just eat you over  the head with a clock.  Well, it is soccer hooligans.  Yeah.  Oh, my soccer hooligan.  I love that.  Just drinking and punching people's faces in because they badmouth their team. 
[03:55:30]  They burn villages.  You've got to love them.  We do it during the World Series, but they do it during the fucking, like, the third game  in June.  Spring training.  That's a great big riot in the stands.  I think the final would be Brazil.  And just to answer that chap's question, I think it'd be.  But why soccer?  Why the excitement?  There's nothing else going on in Europe?  I think, no, there isn't.  We just eat potatoes.  We have one, two.  You know what it's like.  The sun never comes out.  We're damp and we're hunched over. 
[03:56:00]  Wilted, miserable.  It'll never work.  I don't know.  What's the point?  Arguing whether they should accept the Euro or not over there.  Yes.  Do you want to have the Euro now?  Very big.  We've still got the pound.  We love the pound.  The pound.  Everyone loves the pound.  Yeah, I know.  It's so charming.  The Euro is just one of those things, but it's like pound.  And no one can quite figure it out.  We've got this, you know, like, you've got stuff.  This, everything's round.  And we've got this stuff with fucking edges on it.  Yeah, it's very ancient.  It's ancient.  Like something that should come in a little sack. 
[03:56:30]  Here you go for the murder.  You know?  And they give you, like, this octagon piece of silver.  That's right.  These are great.  There's like a picture of some guy from 8,000 years ago on it.  That's right.  That's right.  But didn't England kind of, didn't England say kind of fuck the Euro?  Like, everyone else wanted it, but England was kind of, like, a little resistant of it.  I know that they don't want it.  Yeah, they don't want to accept it.  They don't need it.  They didn't want to get involved.  Captain Obvious wants it.  They've got their money, and it's worth a lot.  Yeah, a pound is worth more than it.  Captain Obvious, Neil, New York, what's up?  Yeah, all right, that's, yeah, I was going to say, soccer, you know, football is actually 
[03:57:00]  very popular over here.  You just, the media, they don't put it on television.  But if you talk to people on the street, going to bar, whatever, you'll find out that a lot  of people in this country really enjoy the sport.  I don't know about that, because the other day we walked with the Stanley Cup, and half  of the New Yorkers we passed had no idea it was the Stanley Cup.  Then again, in New York, so you expect them to know World Cup soccer?  You could walk with a fucking severed head in Manhattan, and most people still wouldn't  look after that.  We'll try that on on our next walk. 
[03:57:30]  Well, you guys have no guns, though.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, we just have a stick.  The police have a stick.  You have to have to phone in to use a gun.  Are you kidding?  No, if there's a situation, they ring up and they go, oh, there's a chap with a gun.  Come on!  No, could you send one down for me?  So, like, half an hour later, some guy turns up with a big case, with a big key and a lock,  and they go, here we are.  Here's the gun.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, he's kind of on the sidewalk bleeding to death.  I mean, it's ridiculous. 
[03:58:00]  There is a lot of complaints about this, and there's, like, police running all over London.  Is there really true to that?  Well, because we had some bombs go off recently.  Yeah, we read about that.  Yeah, we heard about the bombs.  And now there's police running all over London in, like, bulletproof jackets and stuff like  that.  And that's, we can't work that out.  It's like millions of pounds of taxpayers' money can get shot in the head.  It's just, like, here.  We're like, what's the point?  Take a headshot.  Take a headshot.  We can't understand, you know.  But we, where they're trying to get to a situation where they don't want, once you  give the police guns, then the criminals are going to arm up more, and, you know, 
[03:58:30]  that's what they're trying to really worry about.  Yeah, escalate the whole thing.  But I've seen some.  Wait, you knew that?  That they don't have guns over there?  It's common knowledge.  Yeah, yeah, that's pretty common knowledge.  But they do.  I thought it is.  But they do have these quick reaction teams that are armed to the gills.  Like, they have people that show up at these bombing sites and stuff.  That's right.  That have all the guns that the other cops should have.  Yeah.  Like, they come out with machine guns.  But they've got such a difficult job, the police, in London.  Yeah.  Because they've got no weapons.  Because the drug dealers have them, right?  The drug dealers have them. 
[03:59:00]  Like, they've got guns.  It's hard to.  Yeah.  People have got guns in mobiles.  You see that the other day?  In mobile phones.  Cell phones, yeah.  Cell phones.  They're heavier.  If you hold them, you can feel the weight difference.  But to look at them, you wouldn't see any difference.  There's a cell phone with four chambers that hold .22s.  Yeah.  And you could use it as a little gun.  Just take a corn bugger head off.  Yeah.  How is the crime, though, over there?  Because I hear there are certain areas that are pretty bad.  No, it's okay.  It's not too bad.  It's not too bad?  No, no, it's all right.  Not like it?  You feel relatively safe if you walk around, like, anywhere? 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  In London?  Yeah, I think it's very safe here as well.  In New York.  Yeah, huh?  Don't you think?  Yeah, but we're talking about, like, uptown.  See, there's certain areas in New York.  Oh, you see, I don't know, because you have to take me up and be mugged.  You know what we're talking about, Link.  Yeah.  I haven't had the full mugging yet.  No?  You got to, well, you can't leave New York until you've been mugged.  Oh, well, is that part of the tourist thing?  Well, this is just a nice restaurant we like to eat at.  It's 115th Street. 
[04:00:00]  115th Street, way uptown.  Yeah, it's terrific, though.  Yeah.  Oh.  You might want to check it out a little later today.  And don't leave.  Stay late, because that's when the entertainment really starts, late at night.  The sun goes down.  And then just take a nice stroll back downtown.  Have a nice meal at the Kill Whitey Grill.  I'd ask for directions with that voice if you are, isn't it?  Yeah.  Excuse me, I'm new here.  Excuse me.  I've never been here.  This money of yours. 
[04:00:30]  How much is this?  You what, buddy?  Yeah.  Well, you know.  Can I give you a 50?  Is that okay?  I mean, well, I haven't been mugged yet.  And I, I, I, I, that's the thing.  If you saw somebody getting mugged here, would you go and help them out?  No.  No.  Most people just look the other way.  I'd help the attacker.  I think if you, as long as you get your share, then fucking get your share.  Yeah, you know, you need your piece.  But I, I think I would.  I'd help.  I'd help.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Ah, you, that's how you get killed. 
[04:01:00]  It's always the do-gooders.  Is it?  That wind up getting themselves in the middle.  Yeah.  A good Samaritan tried today to help a person getting mugged, and the person getting mugged  is fine, the mugger is fine.  Yeah, but there's that other thing where you might help them, and then you become a hero,  and then you bring out a book.  A hero ain't nothing but a sandwich, my friend.  Good point, Ant.  Good point.  Let me just, let me just be a little, uh, profound and say that one.  Yeah.  What was it, 74?  I don't know.  Old movie cares.  I got nothing.  So, we should talk about what you're doing there, Lee Evans.  I want to actually come, I saw Lee live one time at the comic strip here in New York. 
[04:01:30]  Everyone's saying that.  Great.  Great.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, just a, kind of a maniac on stage, but really funny, um, and I really want to go  see these shows.  Yeah.  Where are they?  It's, uh...  Where at?  Well, it's called Same Planet, Different World at the 37 Arts Theatre, 450 West 37th Street.  Starts today through June 3rd.  Ticket info, call the box office, 212-560-8912.  June 3rd?  Mm.  That's a long gig.  Two weeks, right?  You get two weeks out.  Wow. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  How long do you do it?  What are you doing, 90 minutes of the show?  Uh, yes, two, two, uh, is it 45?  I don't know what they do here.  I can do a couple of hours if they want.  The time is metric, right, that you're used to.  Oh, man, that kid didn't even start yet.  Centi-minutes or something?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was doing meters.  Meters.  Meters.  Yeah, you're on for five meters.  Yeah, back in the day, you tried to get us on that meter thing.  Yeah, yeah, that whole metric thing.  We weren't buying that.  We weren't buying it.  That's when I was in school, and they're like, you know, by the time you're grown up  and get a job, they're all, the whole United States is going to be on that metric system. 
[04:02:30]  I was just amazed that America listened to the idea, because there was about two or three  years there where we were really considering it.  And then they put it, both, on everything for a while.  Yeah.  They tried to figure out, like...  Have you still got gallons and stuff?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We got all that old, timey stuff.  Because we've got liters.  Yeah.  I heard about the liter.  Suddenly, like, petrol and gas was really cheap, because we suddenly went liters.  Yeah.  Wow, it's only like, you know, they owe us money for the petrol.  Yeah.  You're getting what amounts to a quart.  Yeah, a quart.  Yeah, what's the gas price up to these days? 
[04:03:00]  It's actually, um...  We're getting close to you guys, finally.  Yeah, so one pound, uh, one pound...  Five or six dollars a gallon?  A liter.  A liter.  This is much.  Oh, you want us to do math now.  How many liters in a pound?  I mean, I know, but a lot of you are probably wrong.  Oh, three is...  No, it would be a gallon.  In a gallon, I make...  He said pounds.  I don't know.  Okay, terrific.  That's a little bit of a trumpet playing.  And then there's quid.  Quid. 
[04:03:30]  How much is a quid?  And then they've got all these other things, like, monkey.  A monkey.  Yeah, they give you, like, a fire pan.  And they say, oh, that's a monkey, and here's a donkey, and a hoof.  Yeah, there's all these...  Slang.  Well, it would be like a buck.  You know, here's a dollar, or a buck.  Yeah, there's all these kind of...  Give you a, you know, here's a chimp.  Chimp?  Yeah, oh, a chimp.  I'm a millionaire, you know.  Do you know what I mean?  It's ridiculous.  I love you, English.  What is gas up to, though?  Five or six dollars a gallon over there? 
[04:04:00]  Over there, is it?  How many liters in...  I believe they call it petrol over there.  Petrol, yeah.  It's petrol.  It's gas.  Oh, thank you.  The juice.  How many liters in a gallon?  The hell are you...  How many liters in a gallon?  I would say 3.6.  God, you know.  But is it?  I don't know.  It's somewhere very close to that.  It could be 50, and you could be...  That sounds good.  You know.  3.2?  Now I'm getting 18 different answers there.  What is it?  3.2?  Oh, some people can tell you.  I'll go with 3.2.  So how much per liter again? 
[04:04:30]  3.8.  I'm going to do the math.  Oh, but you're doing pounds.  We don't know pounds.  Forget it.  What's the conversion for that?  I don't know.  You know it's impossible to figure out how much money it costs to buy a gallon of gas as  opposed to here.  Didn't they call this the new math when we were growing up?  It would take a mathematical genius to figure out the actual price, and we just don't have  one here.  How many dollars to a pound, though?  The pound, it kills us.  8.  1.87.  8.  What?  1.8.  1.8.  You are not ever going to get this. 
[04:05:00]  Yes, you are.  Don't even try it, you idiot.  How many liters in a gallon, but you got to take away two quarts for the initial fill-up?  Wait, 1.87 what?  You just don't want to do this.  A gas station, dude.  What?  Dollars per pound?  3.8 liters in a gallon.  All right.  3.8 liters.  They're not.  They're not.  They're not.  So, I'm almost there, so.  No, you're not.  You are so far from there.  How many pounds for one liter of gas?  Are you really working it out?  Oh, well done.  How many?  I have no idea.  I don't know. 
[04:05:30]  I'll take a bus.  3.8.  1.87 times 3.8.  No, because how many pounds in-  Trust me.  How many pounds for a liter of gas?  That's all I need to know, and I got it.  3.87.  Well done.  Times 1.87 will give you dollars.  Trust me.  Yeah, but he needs to know the cost of gas per gallon.  You have to take that and multiply it by the price.  Yeah.  Yeah, by the price.  3.87 is the amount of liters in a gallon.  He needs the fucking price.  I need the price.  1.8 in England.  1.8 in England.  How many pounds for a liter of gas? 
[04:06:00]  I think it's about one pound five pence.  Pence.  Pence.  Oh, Jesus.  Pence.  And a monkey.  Oh, Jesus.  And a chimp.  And small sheep.  Pence and a sheep.  I can do five sheep for that chimp.  Yeah.  How's the royal family doing over there?  They're all right.  I saw them yesterday.  I was running their kitchen.  There's so much scandal lately.  No, I think they're keeping their heads down.  They're kind of.  They were.  A lot of scandal went on for a while.  Well.  And then the kids are growing up and doing their own thing. 
[04:06:30]  Yeah.  And.  They've done all the stamps and.  Are they a little upset about the Prince William kind of going bald?  A little young age there?  Is that making the tabloid?  Well, no.  They're going to store some form of rug.  Oh, they're going to put some kind of maybe a transplant or something?  Yeah, it'd be a royal rug, though.  It'd be a special one.  Why would you?  It's like all I would.  I would make girls blow me while I held a mirror over it and go, suck the future king's dick.  And make them look at the bald spot.  Oh, that's outrageous.  That's our royal family, if you don't mind.  Oh, dear. 
[04:07:00]  You're saying that.  That's Iscock, you're saying, son.  Dan is saying $7.06 a gallon.  Told you he'd get some.  Someone else said $7 a gallon.  Did you do my man?  Close.  Yes, we did the Jimmy man.  Dan is so smart.  He's not.  He just did what I told him.  No, he didn't.  You told him nothing.  You're an idiot.  So what's the show about?  What's the show about Same Planet, Different World?  Well, it's just two hours of stand-up, really.  Hopefully it's funny.  Hopefully it's funny.  You're doing two hours?  I do 45 minutes, maybe an hour. 
[04:07:30]  I can't do any more than an hour.  I just think it gives you more chance to sort of...  I've never had the chance to come to New York and do a bit of writing and...  Because usually you go to a stand-up club and they go, you're 18th.  And they go, do your thing.  And they get back to lamey son of a bitch.  Who cares?  You guys ain't funny anyway.  You know, and that's it.  And we're just sort of gone, you know.  So it's nice to come over and have a chance just to get some stuff working, really.  What do you like about America? 
[04:08:00]  I think it's a nice place to come.  It's very hospitable and people are nice, aren't they?  When you have that accent, they are.  Are they?  Yeah.  Girls really love English accents, Aussie accents.  They really like...  Well, I'm not after any women or anything.  No, I mean just what I'm saying.  I'm not coming here on the chance.  That's why they are, like, cordial.  I didn't get off to playing with all equipment in a case.  I'm in New York, I'll change my accent.  But people find it charming.  Even guys, like, because it's non-threatening.  Oh, is it?  It's something non...  Yeah, you can't be like, could I rob you, please? 
[04:08:30]  You know, it doesn't come across as threatening, your accent.  Right.  So it's kind of nice.  And the girls, like I said, like it.  I think that's our schooling system.  They just beat you down at school, you know?  Is that what it is?  Shut up.  It's all that.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Would you kindly stab me in the eye again, sir?  You know, it's all that kind of stuff in school, you know?  Are you touching yourself again?  It's all that kind of stuff, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Keep that guilt on you.  Oh, man.  It's a nightmare, yeah.  Your act, a lot of just life observations and your take on it. 
[04:09:00]  Yeah, and I'm not sure if it's going to work, really, but I'll try.  It's just, you know.  I don't know.  It's a chance.  Very animated.  Very animated.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Really fun to watch.  I remember years ago, I had never heard of you, years ago in the comic strip, and someone's  like, yeah, I'll watch this guy.  You're really going to like him.  Good.  I hate when people just stand there stiff and do.  Look at this.  He's moving.  Oh, that was my opening.  A lot of tape recorder plays of material.  Yeah, you fucking wave and grab the check. 
[04:09:30]  I'll just put the DVD on.  Yeah, don't forget that part.  Because comedy-wise, it's like a big event for them, British comedians.  It is.  Whatever they say and tell you, it is.  Because a lot of good comedy has come out of America.  So it's always, if somebody says, oh, do you fancy coming to New York for a couple of  weeks?  And you think, oh, God, I'd love to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, like I said earlier, you know, that you're 18th on in the comedy club, and you  don't, you do 10 minutes, and then the guy's kind of getting you out the door. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  And it's horrible, that.  I find it, like, I give you a lot of credit, because I would find it horrifying to go to  another country, regardless, you know, the language is the same, relatively, but to do  that.  American comics do very well in England.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  Patrice has told me to go over many times.  You know Patrice O'Neill?  Big black guy.  No one likes him.  He's a remarkably unpopular human being, but they love him in England.  He's a great comic, and he's always saying, go over there, man.  They really respond very well.  You should do that, Jeremy.  I don't know. 
[04:10:30]  I've always, I've never been sure if it would work or not.  That would scare the hell out of me, though.  You should try it, really.  I mean, it's, you know, it's creative.  1010 Winds, the news station here, has an English guy doing the traffic, and I was like,  it stunned me.  I'm like, how does he know the roads?  Oh, right, yeah.  Like, he's like, the Long Island Expressway is a little backed up today.  And I'm like, I couldn't imagine going, I couldn't name a road over there.  The G, what do you got?  Like, some kind of, what's the big highway over there?  The M1.  The M1.  There's a little bit of a bang up. 
[04:11:00]  You know, and I couldn't imagine, like, I'd have maps and get everything wrong.  Well, you've got, you're on a grid system, so it's really easy to find everything here.  They just, you go up there, do a left, and it's just.  Oh, what are they, pave cow paths over there, like Boston?  But in England, the Romans just built a road, so they strapped like a, I don't know, some  sort of apparatus to an idiot, and they said, walk this way.  And he went up, like, north somewhere, and it was called, like, M1.  It's called the M1 from now on.  And it's just, there's roads, wherever you look, you know, so you can't, it's difficult 
[04:11:30]  to give someone directions.  Oh, man, that would drive me nuts.  If you said, oh, where's Piccadilly Circus, they go, oh, you need to go left, then right,  and then up there, and then spend some days there with some food.  You have supplies, right?  No, I don't have no supplies.  Well, then you need some, then take a small yak, and, you know, and it's fucking, it takes  you days.  Oh, my God, that would drive me nuts.  Hey, let's get a mic in New York.  Oh, what's up, Mike?  Hey, Lee, I loved you in Something About Mary.  I think you played the best cock walker. 
[04:12:00]  Thank you very much, indeed.  I loved doing that film.  It was really good fun.  That was a great comedy.  The Farrelly Brothers, man.  That was a great one.  That was so cool.  Right on.  How was it working with Dreyfuss, man?  It was all right.  I mean, it's interesting, it's just, it's always interesting when you're working with someone  who's done that much work, because all you're going to do is you're going to learn something.  You know, I know, I don't presume I'm anything.  I'm a fucking idiot.  So I'd stand there and I'd shut my mouth, and, you know, these guys are big stars, so 
[04:12:30]  I'd kind of watch him, and he was fascinating to watch in rehearsals and stuff like that.  You know, watch these guys work.  Can he sing?  Yeah, he could sing.  Yeah.  Really?  We had him in here like two weeks ago.  He didn't mention that.  Really?  Yeah.  Did you have him in here?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Poseidon.  Wow.  We heard him sing, though.  Show me the way to go home.  He can swim, though, right?  I'm tired and I want to go to bed.  And I had a little drink about it now.  And then the shark fucks the whole thing up.  Yeah, and ruins the song. 
[04:13:00]  It ruins the whole song.  I wanted to see the dance number.  Exactly.  Robert Shaw gets up.  Show me your scars.  Show me your...  Musical Jaws.  No one take that.  That's my chief.  Don't forget your robbers.  For 10,000, I'll kill them.  How do you not love Robert Shaw?  You know that shark's on tour now.  Is it?  Yeah, he's doing really well, that shark.  The mechanical one?  Yeah.  Bruce?  Yeah, he's on tour in England.  On England?  Yeah.  See, in England.  You guys get all the good stuff.  People are just pointing at it.  That looks nothing like a fucking shark. 
[04:13:30]  How did that scare anybody in 1976?  Sharks stinks.  I was petrified of that film.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  When did that head come out of the boat?  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  It's still great.  You know, you'd think all the scariest parts would be the attacks or anything, but when  he's underwater and that head just kind of drifts out, and now with all the CGI and effects  and stuff, it kind of looks ridiculous and cheesy, like the whole movie.  But even that part, but man.  You really think so?  I think it still holds up.  That scared the crap out of me.  Yeah, it's really scary.  It holds up because they didn't show the shark that much, which is a good thing now. 
[04:14:00]  That film, you know, The Exorcist?  That actually affected me for the rest of my life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We lived in an old shitty council house when I was a kid.  And we had, the bottom of my bed had these dodgy legs on it.  Uh-oh.  And I watched it.  My brother introduced it to me.  I was about 12.  You know, this is like, wow.  And I went to bed.  Yeah, 12 was a bad time to see that movie.  Yeah, my bed kind of went, ah, like this, you know.  Fucking scary shit, man.  Jaw, uh, this isn't about jaws and if I'm too tall.  Oh, I used to fantasize.  You know, you're a kid.  You fantasize about, like, what you want to do. 
[04:14:30]  Like, you want to be an astronaut.  And I would fantasize that I was in my swimming pool in my apartment complex.  I don't know how the shark got in there.  You idiot.  I was such a fucking asshole.  I would fantasize that I was shooting it and doing Roy Scheider's line.  You couldn't even commit and be in the ocean.  No, I was in the pool.  You scaredy cat.  There had to be something believable when I fantasized.  Like, and I did, was by a pool.  But I had, all the girls had to watch me.  Like, say, smile, you son of a bitch and kill the shark.  You are a sad sorry man.  While I'm holding a shit and kneeling.  And also, I think sharks get a bad press.  Since that film, everyone just hates them and wants to kill them. 
[04:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  As soon as they see a fin, kill it!  Well, every time on the news, every summer, they come up with the big shark attack stories.  Every time, yeah.  And if you look at the statistics, more people, we realized in this country, are killed by vending machines falling on them.  Literally.  Vending machines falling on people have killed more people than sharks.  But you don't see a film, like, with people hunting vending machines, do you?  It wouldn't be very exciting.  I don't know, you could have, like, a vending machine suddenly fall out of a crack in the boat.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Like a vending machine, you've got to quickly put money in it before it gets you around the throat. 
[04:15:30]  Where you pull up to a rest area, and you just see a tipped over machine and two old person feet sticking up.  And then everybody laughs and goes, ah, we're better off.  That's the end of the movie.  Yeah.  And they tie barrels to it and chuck it in the shit.  It can't go down with three barrels.  Can't stay down full of Snickers bars.  You can't.  We ending the show?  Yeah, we should get out of here, actually.  Let me give Lee.  Oh, yeah, promote Lee.  Lee's a great comic.  Great job, man.  37 Arts Theater. 
[04:16:00]  It's same planet, different world.  It's 450 West 37th Street.  It's May 19th.  Was that tonight?  Today through June 3rd.  Through June 3rd.  Lee has a very big fan base here, so definitely call for tickets.  You can get the box office at 212-560-8912, or just go to Ticketmaster for Lee Evans tonight  through June 3rd.  Good night out.  Yeah, man, I'm actually going to go to a lot of those shows.  Thank you for having me in.  Lee, thank you.  Thanks for coming in.  You're a blast, man.  We're going to be around for a couple weeks.  You should come back before you head out.  Yeah, sorry I wasn't funnier.  You were great, man. 
[04:16:30]  No, what are you kidding?  Yeah, I've had no sleep.  That's like the English always.  We've been on the radio since 6, so.  Oh, have you.  Well done, you guys.  Thanks for having me.  That's very kind of you.  Yeah, I know.  I'll mug you outside.  So, thank you very much.  No problem, man.  Let's get.  Yeah, we're out of here for the weekend.  Thanks for checking us out, Lee.  See you Monday.  Once again, thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, we'll see you guys Monday or maybe at Caroline's this weekend for the Brian Regan  shows, right?  Ben, anything else?  Nope.  That's it?  Yeah.  Good.  Big announcement next week. 
[04:17:00]  What is it?  What?  We already said it.  You're teased.  Jimmy Day.  Yeah, we'll give the info.  Jimmy Day is our big announcement.  It's kind of like AIDS Day, but fucking more tragic.  We'll have details on Jimmy Day when?  Monday?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's going to be pretty cool.  A whole day.  Can I ask you a question?  Does that guy actually do stand-up with Tourette's?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have you seen him?  Unfortunately, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's comedy? 
[04:17:30]  No.  Is it?  That's interesting, though, isn't it?  We're not interested in his comedy.  Yeah, it could.  I don't know how it is.  It's got to be very distracting.  I mean, you know how everything is so contingent on timing?  Yeah.  And to get to the punchline and have, brah, brah, brah.  Yeah, kind of.  It's like a sort of one-off laugh, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You laugh with him, you laugh at him.  No one cares.  No one cares.  He don't care as long as you're laughing.  And he gets that check. 
[04:18:00]  That's really weird.  Yeah, he has a true fucking eyeball.  But you have him in here.  What sort of radio station are you running here?  You're crazy.  I know.  It's not real radio.  It's good fun, though.  Yeah.  You just hang out.  There's nothing like that in England.  It's really interesting.  No?  No, where a bunch of people gather around and have fun.  You've got to get satellite in England.  But you're allowed to do what you like on here as well.  Yeah, cursing.  It's fine.  You have a lot of swearing.  Yeah.  Does anyone ever pull you up on it?  Is there some sort of authority?  If there is, we don't even have a boss in the building. 
[04:18:30]  Yeah, the bosses are down in Washington.  Yeah, we don't even have a boss.  Yeah.  You've got a great job.  Is it the same?  You guys come in every day?  Yeah, pretty much us.  And then we have a collection of other people.  There's no real start time, no real end time.  We just go off.  We don't care what the hell we talk about.  It's fantastic, isn't it?  Isn't it amazing?  I love that, yeah.  And a lot of people years ago would talk about England and how free you guys are because  television is a lot more open.  They show the boobies.  Yeah, but it's all like that repressed sexual stuff.  My mom is Irish and my dad's Welsh and everything is like. 
[04:19:00]  Are you wanking in that fucking toilet again?  It's like, no.  You know, it's all that kind of.  So we like to get tits out on TV.  It's like all fucking hell.  See, but here it's crazy.  You can't show anything on regular TV.  Right.  People go crazy.  You could show, you know, to thousands of dead people.  You could show naked dead people.  Wow.  As long as they're dead.  I've seen on the news, naked dead people, if that person had a pulse, they'd get a violation  and you can't show it.  That's insane. 
[04:19:30]  That is so insane.  That's your new ringtone?  I want that on my phone.  It's stupid.  It's the worst ringer ever.  Distracting.  Yeah.  Hi, Amy.  Yes, I would love to talk to Fareed.  Shortly, yeah.  Fareed?  Almost.  Thank you so much for having me.  Hey, no problem, man.  Really kind to you.  I want to give a shout out to you, too.  Hey, why is cunt so popular over there?  The word cunt?  Yeah.  Hi, Fareed.  No, that's not.  Don't worry about it.  Good.  We just finished.  I'm going to talk to the guys who run this thing.  The word is like very popular, isn't it? 
[04:20:00]  Cunt?  Yeah, because here the girls hate it.  Yeah.  Well, they do in England.  Okay.  Do they?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  It's a really bad word.  You just accept the truth of it there.  I mean, cunt.  I mean, I said to my wife.  Yeah, we'll do lunch with you, Fareed.  Shut the fuck up.  No, I said to my wife once, you know, what's the equivalent for men?  And they don't have one.  There isn't one.  No, because we don't care.  No.  Like, if you could be in an argument about something with your girl, and the second you  under your breath...  What do you mean the ONA virus isn't spreading?  And then the argument, whatever you were talking about, is now gone. 
[04:20:30]  Absolutely.  That argument's finished and over.  There's seven markets with more on the way.  See, I always thought that when Margaret Thatcher was like trying to...  You like to insult us, don't you?  You like to beat us down a little bit.  I beg your pardon.  You know, fucking bombs going off.  I think the ONA virus is spreading.  Where are the seven really big markets?  Fantastic, man.  I know.  It's a bonus time without the bonus time.  All right, cheers.  You're very, very kind.  Thank you so much.  Cheers.  You've been so kind.  Providence.  All right, see you again.  Very good, man. 
[04:21:00]  Thank you for having us.  Very cool.  Take it easy.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Anthony, Providence.  And Buffalo.  All right, no problem.  Cheers.  Fareed, where's New London?  Connecticut.  Wait, who's touching me?  Oh, say goodbye.  Who's touching me?  Thanks, Bill.  The English guy.  You know what they say about the English?  We just finished up the show.  Bill Evans is...  Lee Evans.  Bill Evans is the...  Bill Evans is the...  I'm sorry, Lee.  Dude, it's been a long day. 
[04:21:30]  I've been up since four.  Thank you.  Lee Evans, everybody.  Thank you.  Cheers.  There he goes.  New London, what, Connecticut?  That's good.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, you just made fun of us and said that the virus isn't spreading, and then you're...  How has he said the virus?  Fareed, first of all...  Hold on.  Every time...  You know something, Mr. Fareed?  I'm...  I...  Oh, now he's saying he wants to deal with me.  He doesn't like my partner.  Wow.  Get in line, Fareed.  My partner.  Now, listen, Fareed. 
[04:22:00]  Hands off.  I like the way you work, and you try to beat us down, but it doesn't work.  To get you cheaper.  Like, you try to beat us down and say that...  I remember when we said we were going to XM, you said it's the biggest mistake we've ever  made, and blah, blah, blah.  You beat us down, but that's your job, and I understand it.  I appreciate the effort.  It's almost like watching a classic good cop, bad cop, when you know what's happening.  You're not pulling the wool over our eyes, Fareed.  He made fun of us.  You did once with that IPO, and you won't again. 
[04:22:30]  He made fun of us.  He goes, uh, I hear you guys say the ONA virus is spreading, but it's not spreading.  I am smart and entertaining.  And then he offers us...  You are absolutely correct, sir.  Then he offers us Providence, Buffalo, and New London.  He doesn't want...  You want stupid and entertaining.  That's just like...  I get it.  New York, Philly...  Then hire man cow.  Oh, no, that's stupid and unentertaining.  Dallas, Cleveland, West Palm.  So, you got some things for us?  Providence, Buffalo, New London, Connecticut.  Where's New London, Connecticut?  That's up there. 
[04:23:00]  Okay.  I like the sound of that.  Near Rhode Island?  Finally, Buffalo.  Good.  All right.  Buffalo.  It's a harbor town.  Uh-huh.  What happened?  That's good.  Now, you know we are very popular there.  Where?  Although, you might have to check with the police department.  There may still be warrants for our arrest.  Oh, yeah.  Buffalo.  I'm not sure, legally, if we're allowed to even go there.  That was a fun day. 
[04:23:30]  Yeah, okay.  Well, I don't know if there's a law against our voice being broadcast.  I think that's okay.  But going there might be a problem.  A check on wants and warrants.  When does he want this call to start?  I'm going to pee.  Yeah, that sounds fine.  When are we looking?  Timetable.  Okay, that's good.  I like that.  Now, how long?  Less than a couple of weeks.  That would be great.  That would be great.  Now, what about our agent? 
[04:24:00]  Have you spoken with Bob?  He doesn't like dealing with Bob.  Very good.  You want to avoid Bob on this one.  Uh-huh.  You can't avoid Bob.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Right, right.  We'll keep that on the QT.  I hear you.  What part on the QT?  What part of the QT?  Yeah.  Will we ever learn? 
[04:24:30]  Will we ever learn?  Oh.  Yeah.  Will we ever learn?  Fareed, you're a gentleman.  And I appreciate it, my friend.  Opie wants to have the last word with you.  So please hold on.  It's like when Grandpa calls.  Okay, Grandpa, I love you.  Here's Opie.  Fareed, Fareed, we're very excited to work with you again.  Could you pull the phone back a little further? 
[04:25:00]  Could you maybe shut those mics off?  Do you know that goddamn limey didn't even know we were still on the air?  No, that guy was very funny.  I know we're on the air, people.  Don't think that, oh my God, they're dipping.  I'm now starting to dump.  Shut up.  You're going to get us in trouble.  Hold on.  Okay, I'm pulling out my lightsaber right now in the form of a phone. 
[04:25:30]  All right, let me get this.  All right, that'll be rocking.  We'll do a great job.  La, la, la.  What the hell?  Hello?  All right, that sounds good.  Why won't my phone work?  Oh, we've got to get out of here.  Oh, it's ringing.  Thanks, Fareed.  I'm just tired.  I want to go home.  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Answer the phone.  Oh, dear Lord, answer the phone.  I've got to nip this in the bud on the air so it's a bit not at home where it's real. 
[04:26:00]  It's still fantasy world here.  Everything all good?  Jesus.  All right, I'll try yourself.  We've been having a really good time.  All right, hold on.  That's it.  Oh, God damn it.  What?  Our show today was great.  I didn't know.  We were a little slow today.  Damn it, shut up.  We're a little off today.  It's the dump building.  Oh, wait a minute.  Come on, pick up.  Oh, that's right.  If I've got to deal with this at home in real life.  All right.  Hello? 
[04:26:30]  Say hi to the boys, all right?  Pick up the phone.  Jesus Christ.  All right, thanks, Fareed.  All right, bye.  Why can't I get my agent?  What happened?  What happened?  Nothing.  I'm trying to call Bob so I can keep this on the air as a bit instead of it having to  be.  What are you talking about?  What happened?  I wasn't supposed to mention what?  Anything.  Oh.  Anything.  Well, I don't know.  There are things in the works. 
[04:27:00]  But he said he was listening to us all morning.  You would think he would have waited until we actually were off the air.  Yeah, wouldn't you wait until...  You know something?  He called right...  Did he call when we fake went off the air?  We're on in...  He got fooled.  Doesn't he hear on the radio?  Seven cities.  Even if we say we're off the air, if we're still on the air, we're on the air.  Seven cities.  Oh, they said they were off the air.  They must be off the air.  I hear them, but...  Wait, where's the list?  Stop it.  Shut up.  One, two, three.  Oh, my God.  Do you know something?  One, two, three...  We...  Four, five... 
[04:27:30]  I'm pulling us off the air.  Six new cities.  Go to commercials.  Six new cities coming up for the Opie and Anthony show.  I just love a drive in the country, laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon, call 911. </pre>
