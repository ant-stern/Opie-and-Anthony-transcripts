<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' typical boisterous introduction, featuring Anthony's braggadocio about his wealth and sex life, and Opie's complaints about technical difficulties, particularly inconsistent audio levels between the show and commercials.  The conversation quickly turned to the Joe Paterno firing and the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, with the hosts using highly offensive language to express their outrage and disgust.  They engaged in graphic speculation about Sandusky's mental state and potential danger, and frequently digressed into mocking interns and staff members like Matt, Rob Cross, and Gary.  Mike Francesa called in, offering a bizarre and offensive suggestion regarding the NBA lockout.  Ashton Kutcher's uninformed tweets about the Paterno firing were criticized, leading to a discussion of the hosts' Twitter blocking policies.  Listener calls interjected, some offering opinions on Paterno, others engaging in humorous and offensive banter.  Upcoming guests Joe DeRosa, Jim Florentine, and Russell Peters were announced.  An 88-second clip of Jesse Ventura discussing conspiracy theories, including HAARP’s alleged involvement in the 2004 tsunami, was played.

The show transitioned to a discussion about a missing sweeper, followed by a segment on the 36th anniversary of the Edmund Fitzgerald sinking and a surprisingly lengthy debate about Gordon Lightfoot's music, specifically "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" and "If You Could Read My Mind." This segued into explicit and offensive commentary on a video montage of men slapping women in classic films, followed by a detailed and vulgar discussion about a transsexual woman, Bailey Jay, including explicit descriptions of her genitalia.  The hosts debated the differences between transvestites and transsexuals and shared their personal experiences with dating transsexual individuals.  Rick Perry's performance in a televised debate was mocked, focusing on his apparent mental lapse.  Michelle Bachmann's tax policy was briefly discussed, followed by an anecdote about an eccentric accountant who worked from a strip club and the impact of his death on their tax situation. The show concluded this segment with plans for the Maryland Irish Festival and discussion of recent firearm purchases.

The next segment began with a discussion about the unsettling experience of anesthesia and the fear of death, especially without religious belief.  This transitioned into a comedic segment on political gaffes.  Studio guests Joe DeRosa, Jim Florentine, and Russell Peters joined the hosts.  A significant portion involved humorous and vulgar discussions about DeRosa's attraction to Bailey Jay, including a hypothetical choice between sexual encounters with her and Buck Angel, with graphic descriptions of both individuals.  A caller from "60s on 6" engaged in a bizarre and profane exchange before being abruptly dismissed.  The upcoming Axl Rose interview was heavily promoted.  Throughout the segment, there were many crude jokes and sexual innuendos.

A segment focused on Axl Rose's positive reaction to his interview with the hosts.  This led to a discussion about the evolution of language, particularly the changing connotations of words like "faggot," and the hypocrisy of organizations reacting to perceived offenses. The hosts reminisced about classic TV shows like *All in the Family*, *The Honeymooners*, *Barney Miller*, and *The Love Boat*, comparing their humor to modern standards.  The hosts also discussed the physical deterioration of various celebrities, using crude and offensive language. Many celebrities were referenced, including Rod Serling, Kiss, Gwyneth Paltrow, Brett Ratner, Eddie Murphy, Dean Martin, Bob Newhart, and Johnny Carson. Archie Bunker’s place in pop culture was also discussed.  The segment featured many off-color jokes and anecdotes.

The final segment began with a caller recounting an embarrassing experience waking up mid-masturbation with his father.  This was followed by an in-studio segment with Russell Peters, who discussed his successful O2 Arena performance, comedy writing process, and the challenges of updating his material.  Jim Florentine and Joe DeRosa were also present.  The latter part focused on the awkward departure of Rob Cross, the show's producer.  A shocking Penn State-related rumor involving Jerry Sandusky was discussed.  Sam Roberts, host of *After Opie and Anthony Live*, interacted with callers, including Club Soda Kenny, who mentioned Stephen Singer Jewelry and made a joke about “Bill Tetley.”  Roland’s birthday celebration, including meetings with Bruce Springsteen and Bill Clinton, was discussed, along with the ongoing conflict between Roland and Troy on Twitter and a new U2 album tribute. The segment concluded with further discussion of Rob Cross and the dismissal of intern Matt for attempting to secretly record the show.

He's the dang open and it only is the dang open  Stop with that shit  And now, here they are  Why, why, why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Baby  Oh my god  My god king 
[00:04:30]  Every time I say my god, I just think  My god  My god king, it's quite a slobber knocker  Hi everybody  Morning Anthony  Morning Opie  How are you this wonderful  And ain't it a fine morning?  It sure is  It is a fine morning  It's volume adjust time  That's why we just babble like this  To adjust the volume  Well I get scared every day  Yeah  Cause my hearing is absolutely going  What?  Breaking news it is  What?  It's  I can't hang out in restaurants anymore 
[00:05:00]  Cause I can't hear anybody  I can't hear  What?  My mother-in-law wants me to get a hearing aid  Oh shit  Or get my hearing checked  Ah!  Oh  Jesus  See?  I thought it was happening  Ow  What was that?  I thought that was my inner ears  I did too  Yeah, she wants to  She wants to check my ears  Cause that's one of the things she does  Yeah  In her life  Checks ears?  Well one day she like  Separated me from the group  Oh boy  And gave me like this 
[00:05:30]  Impromptu hearing test  Hearing test  But I didn't know I was  Having a hearing test  Did you fail miserably?  No  Surprisingly I passed  I think she was surprised too  Oh boy  Why?  Because you're just constantly  Huh?  What?  Maybe I just like to tune things out  In my life in general  If I'm not interested in somebody  I'll just kind of  White noise  But that's why  You're right  Every morning  I start with  I want to see where this shit is 
[00:06:00]  Cause this is a technical thing  And it'll probably bore people  But between satellite radio  And regular radio  They don't have that shit figured out  Yeah  When we did regular radio  You turn the mics on  And all the processing and stuff  You knew you were in this like  This womb of sound  In the zone  You know what I mean?  Like you knew you were protected  But here it's all sharp  Like  A lot of high end  Peaks and spikes  In the sound  That just  Like if anyone was in here  They'd think I was a complete lunatic 
[00:06:30]  They probably do even  Not being in here  But when we go to  A commercial break  Yeah  I have to rip the headphones  Off my head  Quickly  It's like  Alright we'll be back  And then I gotta rip the headphones  Off my head  Because the volume  Of what's playing  Is so fucking incredibly loud  Yeah  It'll just blow my ears  Out of it  For some reason  The commercials are a lot louder  But you talk to them about it  For three years  And they say  No it's the same volume  Over the air  Yeah really?  But it's not in my headphones  That means you're still talking to them  Oh no no  I gave up  It was you know

[00:09:30]  I love Rob Cross  I love Rob Cross  But  This guy  Is the king of small talk  At 5.45 in the morning  He comes in  The king of small talk  He comes in  He comes in what?

[00:11:30]  Having to keep his eyes  On Matt  He's the most  Yeah  E-Rock is beside himself  Because every time  Because E-Rock's the intern boss  Yes  And every time  E-Rock turns his back  Uh huh  Matt is doing something  He's not supposed to be doing  Every time  Every time  Every time  And even after  E-Rock directly tells him something  E-Rock turns around  And Matt is not doing it  Or doing the opposite  How much longer do we have the  Joy of having Matt around 
[00:12:00]  I mean  It cannot  It can't be a short enough period of time  If you said today was his last day  It'd be a very long day  It'd be like  Oh come on  Technically another month  See  Oh wow  See you guys are seeing it all wrong  I like that he's around  Really  Yeah cause these interns  Are just silly  They're like play toys man  They're fun to play with  They call him rubberneck  They're fun to just play with  Yeah  And they bring material to the show  In a weird way  They do  I mean  Matt has unquestionably  Brought material to the show  Well  Him and that big dick  Oh yeah yeah

[00:27:00]  In something  He's not going to have any of that  You're done  You're done  You're all about Schmidt  He's not going to be allowed  Back on fucking campus  No  He went out in the shittiest way possible  With a fucking child rape  If you go out  In any way shape or form  Connected to a child rape  That's bad  I would say  Probably the worst thing  They say  I remember hearing that  In a movie  Like the two worst things  A politician  Or somebody of any  Stature 
[00:27:30]  Could be caught with  Is a live boy  Or a dead girl  There you go  There you fucking go  It's like  The two worst things  That could happen to you  Well here's how  It was reported  I don't know  This must have went down  Late last night  I was up pretty late  And I didn't see this news  But here we go  The Penn State  Board of Trustees  Have held their meeting  They  Have actually  Spoken to reporters  We bring it to you here  On SportsCenter  Hear what they said  The university 
[00:28:00]  To have a change in leadership  To deal  With the difficult issues  That we are facing  The Board of Trustees  And Graham Spanier  Have decided  That effective immediately  Dr. Spanier  Is no longer  President  Of the university  What are they  Mars?  In addition  Joe Paterno  Is no longer  The head football coach  Effective immediately  What? 
[00:28:30]  They just all  Lost their minds  Come on  Let's see this coming  And the students  Rioted  Most of the night  They were rioting  Fucking marching  Around the streets  And yelling and screaming  They're just stupid kids  White kids?  They're just dumb stupid kids  That don't understand shit yet  Yeah they don't know  How to do it right  You get a little older  You'll have  Hopefully some more knowledge  Yeah some knowledge  And understand  That this is a really  Bad fucking thing  And it's unfortunate  Because you know  Paterno is loved 
[00:29:00]  Obviously  Beloved I think  Beloved you call it?  I don't know  He's fucking  He's be out  But how do you not  Understand  I mean  To be upset  Is one thing  And yeah  Yeah sure  Be upset  But how do you not  Understand how this  Had to happen  Yeah  He had to go  There's no way  He would be coaching  A football game  And the  Commentary guys  Calling the game  Are not gonna  Are gonna be  Completely distracted  With what's been going on 
[00:29:30]  Right  It's a distraction  To the school  The game  And you know  If you take the  Horrificness out of it  And just add  How much attention  It's getting  It can't work  Right  Fire everyone  But then you add in  The fact that it's  It's a fucking  Child rape  Then it gets bad  Wow they're tipping  Over news vans  Look at me  Look at that  There goes the  CBS news van  Wow  Oh boy  Yay  We tipped over the news van  Now what  It's like  That is the dumbest thing 
[00:30:00]  I just don't get it  It just kind of  It makes you feel good  I guess  I guess so  I think it's pretty easy  To tip over cars  Yeah  How many guys  Does it take  You think  Probably five guys  Especially something  Just five  Yeah I think five guys  You could get a car over  Yeah  I've seen it with  Like two real bruisers  But yeah  Five average guys  We are  We are  We are  We are  Oh boy  What did  What did  What did that  Window do 
[00:30:30]  Just running  Ramping through  The streets  Breaking things  Yay rape  Yay  Oh boy  But see  That's why  That's why  The college  Did what  It had to do  Because they want  To continue  The legacy 
[00:31:00]  Of Penn State  They're trying  To protect  The college  Itself  Right  So then you  As a  College kid  Could still yell  We are Penn State  And be proud of that  And not like  We're Penn State  Right  We're kind of Penn State  So it kind of goes  Against the whole  Don't agree with everything  That goes on there  But I'm Penn State  Right  Yeah  That's what they're  Trying to protect  So you can yell  We are Penn State  And be proud of that  Don't want to tarnish  The image too much  Right now it's a little  Rough for everybody  If they could connect it 
[00:31:30]  To one guy  That's fine  If it spreads  And tarnishes  The image  Of the  Illustrious  School  Then there's  A big problem  We got Chris  In Delaware  Chris  Hey Chris  Hey  It's Joe Paterno  Sounds like it'd be  A good sandwich  On a rye bread  Or something  He's not  Not even here yet  We have to live  With the horror  What's your  What's your  Twitter  Because I'm blocking you  He left  He left that one  See he fucking tricked us  Just doing shit

[00:33:00]  So if you don't know  Why you were blocked  It was one of those two things  Or you know  You know  Because you were an asshole  But if you just think  I was just doing  That's why  So bye bye  I'm doing everything  To keep my Twitter fun  Simple as that  Bye bye  Simple as fucking that  And the chip  Huh  I know the chip thing  Works on the show  And stuff  But  Fuck  Oh I know  It's just  It's so enraging  And I'll give you  Another tip  Yeah  If you're gonna  Beat me up over  A tweet 
[00:33:30]  Your timeline  Better damn well  Look fucking  Amazing  Oh yeah  I look at some  Of these people  They'll give me  A little jab  Fine  Then I'll go  To their timeline  And I'll go  Seriously  You shouldn't be  Commenting about  Anyone's fucking  Tweets  Exactly  Holy shit  Make sure your  Fucking timeline  Is amazing  Before you go  After anybody else  You're an idiot  Sandusky's out  On bail  What  Yeah man  David in Richmond 
[00:34:00]  David  Oh hey  I was just  Gonna comment  That the story  I saw  That's just  Mentioned  That Sandusky's out  On bail  Which I think  Is one of the  Most amazing  Things  How the fuck  You know  Something  Let me tell  I was watching  The Michael  Jackson doctor  Trial there  Dr. Murray  And he was  Convicted  But they had  Pushed to  And it's not  Unprecedented  To have him  Stay out on bail  Until sentencing  Right  And they said  Because of a  Public safety  Concern 
[00:34:30]  That no  They were not  Giving him bail  They were putting  Him in jail  I honestly  Don't think  Dr. Murray  Would have been  A danger to  Anybody  I don't think  He's just  Gonna go  And get  Some propofol  And enter  Someone's house  And start  Like shooting  People up  With propofol  I thought  They were doing  It because  Some of the  Michael Jackson  Fans were trying  To get at him  No it's for  Public safety  They don't  Think he  They see him  As a safety risk  Meaning he could  Do something bad  To somebody  Yeah yeah  Oh that's stupid  I thought it was  The other way  He ended up  Killing somebody  Right  Regardless of  The intention 
[00:35:00]  But because of  That it's a  Public safety issue  And they  Kept him in jail  Okay  This motherfucker  Is absolutely  A public safety  Issue  It's known  That child molesters  Have  They don't get cured  They have that urge  And the  What is it  Recidicism  Reviticism rate  Is it recidicism  Or reviticism  Revisit  Recidicism  The rate that  Everything happens again  Look I don't know everything 
[00:35:30]  Now you're talking  Now you're talking  My language  I don't need those  Big words in my life  Recidivism  Recidivism  Recidivism  Why would you ever  Learn that word  The recidivism rate  To use it what  Twice in your lifetime  Who gives a fuck  Now I know  You guys may want  To confirm that  But that  Wait you're the one  That said he's out on bail  Yeah  And now we're confirming  Why didn't you confirm it  Before you called  You dumb fuck  You guys are supposed  To do half the work  For us at this point  In our careers  If you're saying  He's out on bail  I can't imagine 
[00:36:00]  He's out on bail  I cannot imagine  He's out on bail  I will bet  I will bet money  He's not out on bail  Why  Because  It's a hundred thousand  Dollar bail  Is what  I saw on the news  And I'm not  He arranged  And released  On one hundred thousand  Dollars bail  The same day  How  Because our judicial  System sucks  A big fucking  Dick  If anyone  Should be  Kept in jail  With no bail  Whatsoever  It's someone  That bent a  Ten year old  Over and fucked  Them in the ass  Probably  Because a lot  Of this shit  Is hearsay 
[00:36:30]  Right now  Where's the fucking  Evidence  Except for  Some people  Talking so far  To a grand jury  Hey  Whatever  Well that's what  They would say  Well they're making  A million bucks  Making a lot more  Than a hundred thousand  What is that  You fucking  A hundred thousand dollars  Bail is like  Ten thousand cash  What  I would love  To follow this guy  Around for a day  Like what do you do  In your  In your day  Knowing what's  What went on  And what could  Possibly go on  In the future  Look over your shoulder  Like  What was that  Is he  Is he enjoying 
[00:37:00]  Music  Is he on his  iPad  Doing some apps  What is he doing  Is he downloading  An app  Just going  Yeah I could  Use this one  I'm serious  It looks fun  He's gotta  Avoid the  Kid fucking  For a while  But what  What is he doing  To fill up his days  Yelling at  Call of Duty  You think he picked up  Call of Duty  Playing Call of Duty  Ah fuck  That's the weird shit  I always wonder  Hi boys  I'm here to play  Yeah he's out  On bail in  That's crazy  He shouldn't be  You know  Call me crazy 
[00:37:30]  I'm done with  These people  Eric go ahead  Yeah guys  I think we should  Take it easy  On these guys  Don't you think  That we've all  Had our little  Uncle Paul-y  Moments  Where we're not  Thinking clearly  And shit goes wrong  And you fuck  A ten year old  Boy in the ass  I mean  Uncle Paul's  Done it  We've all done it  We've all had  These little  Mishaps  Where we're not  Thinking clearly  Are you doing  A bit  He's doing a bit  At least tell us  You're doing a bit  Yeah tell us  What the character

[00:38:30]  That was fucking  Dead on  All right  Thank you sir  I'm a teacher  I get disgusted  When things like this  Happen to kids  You don't have to be  A teacher to be  Disgusted by this  This is pretty much  Universal man  Yeah it's sort of  One of those  Repugnant  Things  That's across the board  Yeah  Don't you think  Oh yeah yeah yeah  When a ten year old  Is being fucked  Ass raped in the shower 
[00:39:00]  Maybe not  By an old codger  You really do  Go like  Ah  It's not universal  Parts of Thailand  Well that's true  That's true  There's provinces  Over there  That might look  Differently at this  They turn their head  You think  Yeah  Who's to say  The kid didn't  Enjoy what was  Going on  Marcos  Oh boy  See that's just  Marcos  Hey good morning  Are you doing a bit too  Is this another bit guy  The totally

[00:40:00]  Wouldn't have enjoyed that  Well not at ten years old  And being forced  I don't think so  I think you let the boy  Decide  What he wants to do  And as they get older  Perhaps then  He can decide  If he wants to  Assume the position  In a shower  And get fucked in the ass  By an older gentleman  Tree Ford Richard  He sexually  Was sexually assaulting me  Yeah he was hoping  I know  He was hoping  My god man  But Ant was old enough 
[00:40:30]  To decide on his own  Decide for myself  Ant wasn't being forced  To take a dick in the ass  And then go  Wait a minute  Suck that cock  Pretty boy  Right  You're right  I'm sorry  Of course you are  Marcos  We're talking about  A ten year old kid  Well you're right  You're right  You're right  That's the one face  You know  The one victim  We know about  Yeah there were others  In details  Yeah  Now  With the details  All the steamy details  Yes yes  In the shower  It was steamy  Do you think 
[00:41:00]  Maybe in  Another country  That would have  Handled it the same way  Marcos  I would hang up  If I was you  I kind of like you  But you're like  You're blowing up your spot  Yeah you're right  This is a rough one  To justify  Yeah  I know  I tried to bring funny  Sorry  Try to bring the funny  This was supposed to be funny  It's bring the funny guy  I'm confused by these  People today  Were you doing a bit  I don't think you were  I don't think so  No it was kind of like a bit  I was going to go

[00:46:30]  Alright, we should  Go to break then  Oh, my Sam-age  You got your Sam-bo  Oh, yeah  We got a busy show today  Once again  I'm hungry  That queer Joe DeRose  Is coming in  Joey's coming in  In a few minutes  We're gonna ask him  A few questions  Oh, yeah  I want them  Answered immediately  We got Jim Florentine  Coming in today  What is he promoting?  Jim's floating  Jay Flo  The big Axl Rose interview  Yes  That metal show  Which airs tomorrow night  Alright, cool  I can't wait 
[00:47:00]  I think he's at Bananas  This weekend  I can't wait  To hear his impressions  Of talking to Axl  And Russell Peters  Who's just an animal  On the comedy circuit  Is stopping by today  At 8 o'clock  So we're very excited  About that  He's at Caroline's  This weekend  Starting tonight  But it's been sold out  For  Peters?  Yeah  Yeah, he just wanted  To come in and say hi  And do some radio with us  Which is cool  How did the Andy Dick thing  Go down?  It was alright  He was a little hostile  I mean he came in at like  With 5 minutes left  In the after show  We had to go a little over  Great  He was a little hostile 
[00:47:30]  Because  As it turned out  People  I guess were listening to you  In the beginning of the show  Yesterday  Say  Like why are we having  Andy Dick on?  Yeah, I don't like the fucking guy  Right  So then they tweeted him  If it was up to me  I wouldn't have had him on  But you know  We have this  We have this democracy here now  And it's fine  And he said  He started  He kind of started  To play the game at first  Like I've never  I don't know who  Opie and Anthony are  But I was excited  To do the show  He fucking knows who we are  I hate when people do that  But he also  He read about the show  In the Idaho 
[00:48:00]  I think it was Idaho  In the Idaho newspaper  About Jacktober  Oh right  Because I guess he was in that  He says he was in that town  On that  Right  When that paper came out  He knows who we are  And so  Yeah  He was taking like  Wow  I want to see who these guys are  That made those DJs cry  He's outrageous  Oh really  And he said  He said  You know  I mean  If you like that kind of radio  It's all fun and games  Until you know  Somebody commits suicide  And we were like  Like you've never  Upset anybody  Andy Dick  Shut up  Shut the fuck up  By touching them inappropriately 
[00:48:30]  Pull your dick out  You're gonna  You're gonna talk about morality  Let's talk about  How your addiction  Has fucked up  The people around you  Go fuck yourself  I don't like the fucking guy  No  I never found him  Outrageous  Yeah  He's fake edgy  He was  He was 40 minutes late  And honestly  In the end  And you can tweak this to him  We wanted to talk to Sam's mom  Way more than we wanted  To talk to that idiot  Well that's what I told him  He said  I was a little late  And I wanted to come on late  And I said  You know  Honestly 
[00:49:00]  You got here at 917  A little late  You were booked at 840  And we moved on  With the show  We have other things  No  The asshole fucking avoided us  Because I got a note  Just so you know the full story  In the middle of talking to  Sam's mom  I got a note that said  Andy Dick's doing out cue  Oh really  But I don't think he was doing out cue  Because I saw one of the out cue guys  In the bathroom  And I asked  How was the Andy Dick thing  So then why was he telling me  It was good  I don't know  But when I walked by  He was definitely on out cue  But it might have been  There's confusion there  It might have been later  Because Andy said 
[00:49:30]  That he was standing around  Doing nothing  And he wanted to walk by the window  Well he didn't walk by the window  He avoided us  Because in the end  He would have got his ass kicked  That's Andy Dick  He talks a big game  But I could handle an Andy Dick  Trust me  He said he wanted to come on  I got the note  He wanted to come in  Right  So I didn't say no  But I never saw him  And then we left  I never saw him  Where was he  I don't understand  He was hiding  And then when we're gone  Then he comes in I guess  He kind of  Well not kind of 
[00:50:00]  He said twice  That he was wondering  If you guys were afraid of him  And Jim and I  Afraid of Andy Dick  I hope you guys assured him  Jim and I assured him  That fear was not an issue  Fear?  That there was not an issue  Of you guys being afraid  To confront Andy Dick  I would have to  It might have happened  In my career  I would have to go home  And think about this  If I was ever actually  Really scared  At someone on the air  Like if Ray Liotta  Said there was a confrontation 
[00:50:30]  You might have been intimidated  Ray Liotta  Absolutely intimidated me  A little bit  I did admit that  But like when you watch  Andy Dick  When you watch news radio  You're not like  Oh shit  I don't want to fuck  With that guy  Whoa that's Andy Dick  He's crazy  Nice  I could give a shit about him  Yeah right  I could give a shit  About Andy Dick  Who cares  In the end we wanted  To talk to your mom  That was way more important  And I knew that would be  Better radio  And it was  And he absolutely avoided us  Because we've had people  That we've kind of  Blown off or whatever  And they'll walk by the window  Like hey  And sometimes we'll acknowledge him 
[00:51:00]  And go alright  Come on in  But I never saw the fucking guy  He was  He didn't directly say  But my take from what he was saying  Was he made it seem like  He was told not to  Approach the window  That's bullshit  Well you're not even  Blowing him off  He was 40 minutes late  I know  That was not us  Blowing him off  Yeah  That's the important part  We've got other things  To do  Yeah  Like you can't go on Letterman  If you're scheduled  For the second segment  And show up for the third  And be like  Well I'm here now  Can I  Dave  Are you scared  I was telling someone yesterday  You know sometimes 
[00:51:30]  Guests are late  And we don't give a fuck  And we go yeah whatever  Whenever he gets here  It's fine  But sometimes we do have shit  We really want to get to  And I know Paul's mom  Made that shit  And it would be a good thing  To keep that storyline going  Because people seem to be  Enjoying that  So I'm like  We really want to talk  To Sam's mom today  So it made it tougher  To just say yeah  Bring him in when he gets here  You said early in the show  I'm going to get you today Sam  I didn't know what you were talking about  Yeah I couldn't wait  To get to that segment  But obviously  Yeah  You had that planned  And just to you know  Set the record straight 
[00:52:00]  If he showed up in the building at 9  Yeah  Me and Ant were here from 9  To a little past 10  Never saw the fucking guy  Nope  Yeah he was here like 9, 17  Is what the note said  He was also  He's fighting with Howard  He was trying to get on  Their wrap up show  After he was done with us  Right  They wouldn't let him on  He was just staring in the window  Good  Awkwardly  Because they fucking know  He's a dick  It's uncomfortable  It was uncomfortable to watch  Yeah  Because I  Like I saw him  When I was going to the bathroom 
[00:52:30]  Baba Booey like saw him  Yeah  But I could tell by his face  Like I couldn't hear it  Because it's soundproof obviously  But I could tell by his face  That he didn't want to acknowledge  On the air  That Andy was knocking on the air  Because I don't  I'm almost positive  He didn't get on  Ah you stupid fuck  But you know  I mean  Do you think he still thinks  He's a lot bigger than he is  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  He probably has his fans  Good for him  I just don't like the fucking guy 
[00:53:00]  I was glad he came on the after show  To tell you the truth  I mean just  Because it's something  You know  To talk about  And it was good to  Have him you know  Mix it up  But  There's not enough wackiness  On the after show  It was good  Yeah  It was a good  Not quite enough  It is good right  Andy Dick doesn't know  Who ONA are  But wanted to come on the show  He heard about Jocktober  Right  Andy says he wanted to come in late  Andy talks more about  Making the Jocktober  DJ cry  Ugh

[01:00:00]  The unwashed hippie pussy  That this guy was crushing  With this song  And then it's the backup guy  Gordon Lightfoot's backup guy  The Lightfoots  Yeah, the Lightfoots  Yeah, Gordon and the Lightfoots  Dream real  Tell all the same  What you really mean  Sometimes  All right  So you like the Gordon Lightfoot  I like that song  Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald  What was the other one?  Some guy said any song  Could be sung to  The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald 
[01:00:30]  Yeah  It was fucking great  It was like  Oh say can you see  By the dawn's early lights  For the  It's like any song  You can just put it to that  Meaning he was a hack  It was just a rhythm  He came up with  Yeah, yeah  You can put anything to it  Yeah  Because a song like that  You have to be able to put words to it  Because it's just singing  Because it's just singing about a ship sinking  Like none of the words have to rhyme or anything  It just  And the captain set off  And he  It's heading of north  Yeah, it's like one of those  Shitty Irish drinking songs 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, yeah  It just keeps going  Hey, hey, hey  He drank another pint  None of it rhymes  It just keeps going  Oh, it just keeps going  The uh  Oh, you forgot the other one  I knew there was another one  Thanks, Kevin  From Connecticut  If you could read my mind  If you could read my mind  Yeah  Was that him or Jim Croce?  It is  I think that's Gordon Lightfoot  Yeah, it's Gordon  Kevin's  Kevin's never wrong with music  Alright, sorry  If you could read my mind 
[01:01:30]  This is a great shot  I would tell my thoughts would tell  Just like an old time movie  About a book from a wishing well  Or a fortress stronger  That's all I know  I just know the wishing well line  Is this a wedding song?  You think?  I don't think so  Back in the day, maybe?  Yeah  I'm sure many people danced  With their father to this song  At their wedding  Father? 
[01:02:00]  Like when the bride dances with her dad  Oh, it's one of those songs?  I thought it was  Daddy's Little Girl  I don't think it's made for that  I just think  Daddy's Little Girl  Has fucked that whole world up  Yeah  They rarely pick another song  Which one's Daddy's Little Girl?  Almost every wedding I've been at  They dance to Daddy's Little Girl  How's that go?  It's good sex music  You can play that in your bedroom  When you're having sex  Imagine that  You have like a mix thing going  And you have like some cool songs  And then Daddy's Little Girl comes up  And you just go into overdrive  She's all creeped out 
[01:02:30]  The words would be  That comes on  And she starts fucking you harder  Yeah  Ew, hey  This is creepy  You read my mind  She starts really moaning  She lets out a little  Oh  Oh, God  Little fucking light foot, man  That's the way to start the day, dude  Yeah, right?

[01:04:30]  You better get your head and your ass  Wired together  Or I will take your giant cheddar  Oh, please squeeze my tits  They're on fire  Oh, Jimmy  I sucked his joint for 30 minutes  And his prick was like a piece of spaghetti  Oh, shit  Caught me  Nothing but  Caught me  This show is just stupid 
[01:05:00]  It really is  I'm embarrassed I'll get paid for it  He was banging cocktail waitresses  Two at a time  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had  And I've had them all over the world  Yeah, that's the number one, I don't know  That's a father-daughter song at weddings  Yeah  I don't even know what number two would be  No clue  I'm Martino's hilarious  He looks like a jeweler from 46th Street 
[01:05:30]  Oh, shit  Right?  He doesn't look like a singer  Nah  He had to have some mafia in him  He wanted to be like Sinatra and shit, right?  Was he one of the Sinatra guys?  Yeah, he kind of wanted to be  Look at him  Oh, look at him in that tub  Oh, fuck  Look at that guy  Yeah  I just got some beautiful stones in  You gotta see these  Oh, boy  Look at the guy  Holy shit  He looks like he could have slapped a broad or two in his day 
[01:06:00]  Probably in his younger day  Because it was still acceptable back then  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  There's a whole movie montage  Where you see all these famous actors  Just slapping broads  Because  Those were the day  You ever see that clip?  It's amazing  It's movie scenes, though, right?  Yeah  It's not actual  But it was completely accepted  Oh, yeah  It was completely one of those things in your handbook  To calm down abroad  Did you ever see  Play It Again, Sam?  Which one is it?  Play It Again, Sam?  Casablanca?  Well, no  It's a Woody Allen movie 
[01:06:30]  But he plays a character  Who's got no luck with women at all  And he's obsessed with Humphrey Bogart  And Humphrey Bogart  And Humphrey Bogart, like, appears to him throughout the movie  Yeah  To coach him through women  But it's a really funny sort of social commentary  Because, you know, it's early 70s  When that transition sort of happened  After that old guard  Into this new era of, like, sensitive hip man or whatever  Right  And Woody Allen can't adjust  Because he's obsessed with Bogart  But he's not a modern man  But there's, like, you know, all these scenes where Bogart's like 
[01:07:00]  I never met a dame that didn't understand a smack in the mouth  That's great  Yeah, and he's like, I can't do that, you know  Oh, here it is  It's called The Golden Age of Broadsmacking  Broadsmacking  Do it again, I like it  Do it again  I hit her again  Hold on, pause  He punched her  He gave her a Joe Frazier left  Did you see that?  Jesus  Holy crap  While she's kissing him  He hits her in the side of the fucking head 
[01:07:30]  Right  Holy, who's this guy?  I don't know  Here, play that  Sorry  I like it here  Well, I can change that in a hurry  How's that Reagan?  He was our president  Smack the guy  Yes  Michael Corleone's  Yeah  Matching cake 
[01:08:00]  Why is it so much?  Steve McQueen's just  Holy shit  Pummeling a bitch  Ally McGraw  Yeah, Ally McGraw  I used to love Ally McGraw  You won't stop  He calls her stupid  Uh-oh  Spankings  Holy shit  Pause  We have talked about the grapefruit scene 
[01:08:30]  Ad nauseam on this show  That is fucking hilarious  He takes the fucking grapefruit with his left hand  And just mushes it in her face  That's worse than a slap, dude  Oh, yeah  But that's worse than a slap  That's degrading  Yeah  But  Why I ought to  Yes  Short motherfucker  Yes, hey, you dumb dame  You want to keep going with this?  Angry leprechaun  Yeah, I want to see where these chicks get fucking smacked  This one's been around  We just put it on our Facebook page  If you've never seen it  So  Go ahead, Sam  Make me more 
[01:09:00]  Oh  Curly  Oh  Look how drunk with sex that girl was  Airplane  Get a whole line of people out of there  It's just smacking her in the face  Oh, nice one  Holy shit  They beat broads up back then  Who's your connection?  Fire  Yeah 
[01:09:30]  A lot of Sean Conneries right there, huh?  He was all about his real life  Those are his home movies  Him and Burt Reynolds  My father would be sorry to you  Oh  John Wayne  Spanking her with a shoe  And Nicholson  Mommy Dearest  Yeah, Mommy Dearest  No  Chinatown  Yeah  I mean, it's what's her name for Mommy Dearest  Oh, I'm sorry  Yeah  He throws around that room 
[01:10:00]  This one's not going to be good  Some girl bent over a refrigerator  Her ass is ample  Is this Billy Jack or something?  I can face anything  I smacked her in the face  What is with that?  That just stopped happening in movies  Look at any makeup  Yeah  It's okay  They just put their arms around each other  And they closed the bedroom door  Basically what their montage shows 
[01:10:30]  It was part of courting back then  Yeah, yeah  They liked it  Because a lot of the women  After they got hit  Had that look of  Like you said  The sex look in their eyes  Well, yeah  Like, oh  I see what's going on here  What's so weird to me about it  Is that  You know  Women  Had no real  Like independence  Or rights back then  So you didn't need to hit them  Women now  Are begging for a fucking smack  Worse than they ever have been  And now we're not allowed to smack them  Now you can't  It's all backwards 
[01:11:00]  In movies also  We were just watching those movie clips  In movies  It seems like  If the guy smacked a woman in the face  He could still be the hero of the movie  Right  And the likable guy  And they'll hook up  And love each other  If any women get smacked in movies these days  And I'd be hard pressed to think of movies now  Where women are getting smacked around  But they are absolutely the bad guy  Like there's no redeeming qualities in the guy  After he smacks a woman in a movie  In this day and age  But back then it was like  Hey look it's the Duke  It's John Wayne 
[01:11:30]  He's just smacking a bitch  He's just smacking a bitch  That's the best one  Because he has the broad over his knee  He's spanking her with a shoe in front of a crowd  And a guy stands up and goes  My father would  My dad would be proud  Would be proud  Like  You're doing the right thing  Fucking bitches need a backhand  And they're all cheering  Like yeah she deserves this  You could  And that's what's so crazy  Is you could make a movie  About the 50s now  Or the old west  And you still couldn't like  Have a girl smack in it  Because people  It would be like  Fucking up a lot  Oh  You're just making it easier 
[01:12:00]  For people to beat women  Really  I don't think so  I've never smacked a chick ever  Is anybody in this room  No  That would admit to it  Never a smack  I goon armed a girl  What do you mean  You grab her by the arm  And give her a little shake  Like knock it off  Oh dude yeah  Shit like that  Yeah  Now I know what you mean  And then I had a little mishap  While I was trying to lead  My ex-wife out of a bar  Because my  It was a very weird time  See my girlfriend 
[01:12:30]  And my wife  Were in the same bar  Which got a little touchy  Yeah  And the girlfriend  Called my wife a cunt  And boy did she hate that word  And coming out of that  It was just like nuclear  Yeah  So my girl  My wife  My wife just went  Lunging for my girlfriend  To kill her  I wonder why  And she was drunk  She was really drunk  So I was trying to lead her  Out of the bar  So I grabbed her shoulders  And she's trying to turn around  And get out of it  So I gotta kind of push her 
[01:13:00]  Toward the front door  Well she  She  Tripped  And went to her knees  And her head went forward  Right into the cigarette machine  By the door  Jesus Christ  Just like bam  Her head fucking got hit  And I just let her outside  And kind of put her in a car  I was gonna ask if she  Told her to drive home  I was gonna ask if she  Got free cigarettes  Wait so you sit your wife  Walking and you stay  With your girlfriend  Yeah why do you think  I had a girlfriend  I didn't want to be  With my wife  Oh  Well hey  I'm here with my grandma 
[01:13:30]  Follow the logic  Bring the girlfriend  Into a relationship  Of course you want to be  With the girlfriend  More than the wife  I just love the whole  Honey you need to  Get yourself together  Just cause my girlfriend's here  And she called you a cunt  Doesn't mean you  Have the right to  Freak out right now  I told her that  My girlfriend was  Gonna be there  Like and not to show up  Wait a second  You love conflict  Were you like in the process  Of getting divorced  At the time or something  Oh yeah  Oh okay  You love conflict  See  That's the  Oh I left that part out  Yeah I thought 
[01:14:00]  You just fucking  Went to a bar  And your girlfriend  Was there  And it was like  Oh shit  Nah  It was all on the  Up and up for a while  Yeah I didn't  I didn't have a girlfriend  Until I was you know  Getting divorced  Like it was it was over  It was done  Yeah it was over  So why did your wife  Show up if your girlfriend  Was there  Cause she was being  An asshole  Right  Thinking that she's  Entitled to show up  You know  And uh  She showed up  And then the girlfriend  Called her a cunt  Oh boy  And my wife  Hated that word  Like she was one  Of those women  That just hated  That fucking word 
[01:14:30]  And wow  It makes me so mad  That women hate that word  So much  I know it's so stupid  But not all do  It makes me happy  That there's still a word  You can fuck with people about  Yeah  That's nice  But you know  My buddy said to me once  He goes  He goes  I'm so fucking sick and tired  A chick's complaining  About the word cunt  They act like it's the n-bomb  Yeah  These women were not enslaved  And persecuted  He's like  It's not that  It carries no weight  No 
[01:15:00]  Do you know what I mean  Other than people decided  They were gonna be shitty about it  They don't have a vested interest  In the word  Yeah  There's no history to it  Where you go  Oh man  Unless they're a cunt  Yeah  Well that's true  You know  Yeah that could be  I looked it up  I've looked up the history  Of the word online  And they can't even pinpoint  Where it started  Or whatever  But  Little fun fact guys  7.15 in the morning  Like fun facts  Uh oh  The  The reason that it's considered  A dirty word  Is because  In the early 1900s 
[01:15:30]  It was considered  Not classy  Right  Or not tactful  To use monosyllabic  Lang words  Really  Yeah  It was thought that you were  Of a lesser standing  Socially  If you use monosyllabic words  So cunt  Was a word for pussy  Back then  But it became foul  Only because  It was a monosyllabic word  Not because it meant  Anything dirty  What did they call it then  To make themselves sound  Fancy schmancy  And hoity toity  They called it a  A stink hole 
[01:16:00]  A meat pocket  Yeah  They called it a fish trap  Fishtrap  Taco  Yeah  What was that word  You were using  And what does that mean  Monosyllabic  Yeah  One syllable  That's like  Hi  Yes  Cunt  Fuck  Hi cunt  They really hated it  When you said that  Yeah  And you greeted a woman  That way  I just know that  As one syllable words  Yeah  Yeah  Well it's early 
[01:16:30]  And I felt like  I'm in more of an NPR  Kind of mind  I like that  I feel like I learned  Something today  That I'll forget  By the time  The show's over  But  Yeah  Who gives a shit  Did you watch  The debate yesterday  I didn't  I was out doing shows  And I had to  I actually called in to  I was on Bailey J's  Podcast last night  Oh  Look at you  Another little run in  With old Bailey J  Oh really  I heard you guys  Were talking about  On the show yesterday  Yes we were  We might have  That's why I bring it up  Might have been brought up 
[01:17:00]  You homo  Why the attraction  To the  Transsexual  That would be called  A just transvestite  That's literally  A transvestite  No transvestite  Is a guy  That just dresses up  Like a woman  That's a transvestite  Is a guy  That is a guy  Dressed like a woman  A transvestite  Is a vampire  Wait transvestite  You just throw the clothes on  Right  Yeah she's a transsexual  Her website is  Why is she a transsexual  No a transsexual  Is after the 
[01:17:30]  The operation  Isn't it  No  No  A pre-op transsexual  Means that the op  Is in her future  And I don't think  She wants the op  Why can't  So what is it  Why aren't they all  Just transvestites  Call of duty  Cock ops  Cock ops  I think it's a transvestite  I think it's a transvestite  Well her website  What's the difference  Between a transvestite  And transsexual  She puts  The transvestite  Is a dude  If you just put a dress on  Right now  You'd be a transvestite 
[01:18:00]  But that's what she did  Where's the line  She's got tits  What if you put  What if you're a dude  You put a dress on  And makeup  And fucking  That shit  Oh so she's half  A fucking transsexual  She's trying to  Like have some  Of the body parts  I'll tell you this  Of a woman  Her website says  Transsexual  And I'm assuming  Just assuming  She might know  A little more about this  Than any of us do  Since she went  And actually had  Operations done  Well you probably  Know more than we do  At this point  I don't know  What you guys  Have been up to  I'm just trying  To break it down 
[01:18:30]  Transvestite  Guy  Any one of us  Just throwing a dress on  Hot  With no effort  Transvestite's a man  That dresses up like a woman  You don't put a lot  Of effort into it  But if you're  A transsexual  That means you're  Putting more effort  Like alright  I'm gonna try to  Like make my man  Fucking boobs  Look like  Feminine boobs  Look like tits  Transvestite is  Fucking Hawkeye  Or Clinger  Or whatever his name was  Clinger  Right  And then what's  The other one  Transsexual is  That you have  Woman parts  But I thought 
[01:19:00]  Transsexual meant  That you had  To change your sex  You transsexual  Right  You changed your sex  Well I mean  Even by definition  Even by  Even if a girl  Has tits  And a cock  That's still  A transsexuality  I bet there's  Some other word  For it  You know what I mean  Gay  Yeah  It's still  A transsexuality  Anyway  So you're attracted  To this  Let's see the picture  Lady  Yeah she's  Beautiful  She's smoking hot  But what about  The cock and the balls  Well I told her 
[01:19:30]  This on the  On the podcast  I go  Bailey  Look at  I just would  If I was with you  I'd look at your cock  Like the laundry  I'd be like  I'll get to it later  I don't know  That's funny  It's like  She's  Is that her naked  Yeah  Yeah that's the cock  Wait let's  Blow that up  She's got way bigger  Tits than that too  She got bigger implants  I think so  I mean well  Now  Her  Oh look at that dick  Wow that's rough 
[01:20:00]  Joe  Come on  I think she's hot man  Yeah but  The penis thing  Yeah I can't  This is something  I can't explain  It doesn't  I'm not gay  I've never been  Attracted to dudes  But there's something  About her  That I'm just  Like  Just who she is  I don't know  She's just hot to me  I just think she's hot  It doesn't bug me  She looks feminine  Let's see that picture  Until you see that  That one  She's got a  And  Well  She doesn't look  Manly at all 
[01:20:30]  No  No  Until she pulls down  The panties  That's not a manly  And dude  I sat  I sat a foot away from her  And like you literally  Would never know  And the key thing  With her to me  Is that she sounds  Like a girl  Is the hair real  Yeah  Yeah  I think so  How does a guy  Grow hair like that  I don't know  I don't know  I think like  We kind of talked about this  A little bit on  When she  Yeah you know what  I gotta stop you  Justin from Florida  A man who wears  Woman's clothes  Is just a cross dresser  He's right  I don't think that's right 
[01:21:00]  What are the  I don't think it's right  What are the categories  Cross dresser  Transvestite  I think transvestite  And cross dresser  Are the same thing  Are similar  Or the same thing  I think so  Oh Jesus  Joe  The size of her dick  She's a hot chick dude  I don't care  So you would go down on that  I don't know  That's what  Let's just be honest  That's why  That's why I use  The laundry analogy  I don't know  You'd feel all weird afterwards  I was  I'll tell you this 
[01:21:30]  I was sitting  I was sitting next to her  And talking to her  And stuff  And I was  Way fucking attracted to her  She's hot man  She's really hot  She's got that weird  Like nerdy look  How can you guys  And a dick  I mean  And a dick  After the  The things that you've gone through  On this show  I'm surprised that you guys  Are still this shocked  By something like that  I'm not shocked by it  We're not  I'm just like  Confused  No  It's not a turn on  Like you're turned on  It's weird  I can see that 
[01:22:00]  She looks feminine  I like the pictures  Without the dick  The boot job looks okay  Yeah  I like the pictures  Without the dick  With the little shorts  And the bra  And the bra  And shit like that  That's fine  A whole nother world  But then you look at that  And just go  Oh right  It's a guy  Don't worry about it  You sound like Jimmy now  Don't worry about it  It's nothing  Let's break this down Joe  Yeah  Like what would you do with her  I don't know  Me and Bobby  Were talking about this  The other day  I honestly don't know  I know this much  I've never hooked up  With anybody like her  Right 
[01:22:30]  And I know that I would  You know  Like if she came in here now  If we went out  And she's like  Let's fucking make out  I'd definitely make out with her  But I don't know  How I would react  Once I got into  Penal territory  Any further  I don't know  I really don't know  I never did it  How do you put it in your mind  That you're making out  With a woman  And not a man  Cause she  Dude she's a chick  It's like if you met her  You'd be like  This is a woman  I think they don't have 
[01:23:00]  The smell down  You would just know  It's a guy  She smelled like a girl  I took pictures  With my arm around her  Would you just fuck her  In the ass  Yeah  That's fucking a man  In the ass though  I mean look  If you want to split hairs  Anthony  Would you just try to  Avoid looking at the penis  I don't know  I honestly don't know  I  You know  Would you jack her off  Look  You know  You know  Who knows where the winds  Will take us 
[01:23:30]  I'm just trying  That scorpion song  Should start playing  Winds of change  I swear to you  In the end  I don't give a fuck  I'm just trying to understand  That's all  No I know  I don't care  No I know  You get all horned up  You're making out  You're feeling up her  Her tits  You're like  I'm gonna have sex  With this lady  Lady  I'll do her in the ass  But then you're  Seeing a fucking erection  Yeah  I honestly  It's  It's the first time  I mean look 
[01:24:00]  Years ago  On this very show  Obi  I admitted to  Having utilized  Some tranny porn before  Sure  But  Oh right  But at the time  There was nothing  I never was like  Oh I want to hook up  With a tranny  Or anything  I just didn't  I just  There was something  About the porn  That like  I liked watching  For a little while  And then it just  Went away  It stopped  And then I saw  I never thought  About it at all  And then when I saw  This chick  I was like  I was just  Something about her  I was really  Fucking into her  Would you admit  It's a little gay  Maybe it is  I don't know  You know 
[01:24:30]  I mean she's  Such a girl  It's confusing  It's confusing  It's confusing to me  It's physically  Here's the problem  It's physically  Considered gay  Physically  But mentally  It's not gay  Like you look at that  Like it's a girl  So you're not looking  At it like  Oh I want  Fucking you know  I want  A manly personality  I want to make out  Things like that  What about  I was going to say  She made such a great point 
[01:25:00]  On her podcast  Last night  Because we were  Talking about that  And we were talking  About it  Like does that  Make you gay  If you want to  Bang a tranny  And she's like  She goes  I don't think it does  She goes  Because there are  Females that have  The male operation  And there's a famous one  That looks like  Stone Cold Steve Austin  Apparently  Except he still  Has a pussy  And she's like  What the hell is the name  She's like  You're straight  Yeah Buck Angel  Yeah Buck Angel  She goes  If you're straight  You wouldn't want  To eat that guy's pussy  And I'm like no  She's like no  Because it's a guy  She's like 
[01:25:30]  You look at me  And you're like  That's a chick  But there's a cock involved  Alright  I'm going to stop you there  Because  When guys are  With women obviously  You want to try  To satisfy them  So now you're  Satisfying yourself  Because now you're  Banging her in the ass  But now she wants  Her satisfaction  And now you're staring  At an erect penis  What do you do  Joe DeRosa  Because you're saying  She's a  Is this the movie  Speed  What do you do  But you're saying  She's a woman  What do you do  You believe  Psychologically in your head  That it's more of a 
[01:26:00]  Female thing  But now  You know  You're thinking  Alright  I got it  I want to take care  Of this person  But now you're staring  At an erect penis  What do you do  You know  Sometimes you got to  Do what you got to do  I honestly  Don't know  But then I guess  You would  Think of just  Doing the bare minimum  And that would be  A handjob  Yeah handy  Right  I mean look  I'm very  I'm very  I'm very curious  By it  And  I don't know 
[01:26:30]  In my head  I'm like  Yeah  You know  Fuck it  You know  Maybe walk down that road  See what happens  But I don't know  Maybe in the moment  I wouldn't be able to  I honestly don't know  It's a big penis too  But I  You can't make believe  It's a big clit  It's  It's a big penis  I know  And it's  It would make mine  Look like lousy  Which is the worst part of it  My little fucking popcock  Is sitting there  You're with a quote female  That has a bigger  She's got a nice piece 
[01:27:00]  It's clean looking  It's well groomed  Mine's all fucking spotty  She's got a lot of pubes  You know  It's just  It's something weird there  Yeah  She's  What's weird is  She's smoking hot  And you don't know  What to do about it  I mean you don't know  But the whole Buck Angel thing  That's  That's interesting  Because  Who would you  Rather bed down with  Buck Angel  Who  It's technically  A chick  That's a chick right there 
[01:27:30]  Now  That  See now that  I'm like  I  I mean I feel bad  I'm not trying to shit on the dude  But I'm like  Like it's weird  Seeing a guy with a  Dude I would have to say  That that's gayer  But Buck Angel  Started as a female  You could fuck a vagina  With Buck Angel  And it's  It's technically  It's got ovaries  And all that shit  And it's a girl  But  That is  That's a guy's body man  Gayer right  That is  That is a guy's body 
[01:28:00]  That works out a lot  That's so weird  So it has nothing to do  With the pussy  Or the  The chick  See that's what she  She used to look at  That's what Buck Angel  Used to look like  Before he turned himself  Oh god  She was smoking  No kidding  What did he do  What did he do  She was a model too  I think  Holy  Oh Buck  Why did you do that  Why did you do that Buck  We needed that  Look at that now  That's a guy man  So that  That really confuses everything  Yeah  It's  It's  It's a  Look  It's a whole new 
[01:28:30]  I think if you lined up  A whole bunch of  Average guys  And asked them that question  They would go  They would go  With Bailey over  Buck Angel  Absolutely  Absolutely  But she's got the part  That makes it gay  Yeah but I mean  Let's  Okay look at it this way  Buck is just confusing  Look at it this way  If you were with a chick  Right  That you thought was really  Gorgeous  Whatever  Let's say she had a strap on  On  She wasn't gonna fuck you  With it or anything  But she just had a strap on  On  Would you be like 
[01:29:00]  I can't fuck this hot girl  Cause she's wearing a strap on  Right now  And it's freaking me  You  See you're  You're  You're  No I'm serious  That strap on comes off  I'm serious  That thing comes off  There's only one reason  She would have the strap on  You don't think that's a valid  She wouldn't just be  Walking around with a strap on  Unless she was planning  To use it  But you're  He's just  Joe's just saying like  Look it's just an appendage  Whether it's plastic strap on  Or that you know  You would still have sex with her  Yeah  But I'm saying like  The strap on comes off  It's fake  It's plastic  The dick makes 
[01:29:30]  The dick technically makes you  A man  Yeah  And hers  Still gets fucking erect  But this is  Guys  This is a whole new frontier  We're living in right now  It really is  That would be funny to watch  Barely fuck  I am so not judging you  I'm just trying to  Understand it more  That's all  But I mean  Now that you throw  Now that you throw  The Buck Angel  Into the equation  That makes it really confusing  Because Buck Angel  Looks way more like a guy  Than Bailey  Way more 
[01:30:00]  Well yeah  Way the fuck more  Dude if you  Like she's so much of a girl  If I  Literally  I could be talking to her  For hours at a party  And if somebody came up to me  And went  That's the  You know  She's got a con  I'd be like  Get the fuck out  Shut up  Like I literally  Wouldn't believe it  Yeah  It'd be like one of those  Sitcoms where they do that  And they just get a hot chick  And they're like  She used to be a man  And you're supposed to believe it  I don't believe it  I wouldn't believe it  I wouldn't believe it  But I also think  And I think she mentioned this  On the podcast 
[01:30:30]  Like she  Which by the way  Part two of our interview  With her comes out today  So subscribe to  Bobby Kelly's podcast  On iTunes  Bobby  But um  She  You know what dude  Is the name of it  But she said  I love that  She said that like  She was always like that  She's like  I always sounded like this  My face always looked like  She's like  I just  She's not doing hormones  Is what you're saying  No  And I think  I think she was just  One of those people  Where genetically  Like leaned way more  In a girl direction  She just ended up  With a dick  And now she's a chick  You know what I mean  Like everything else 
[01:31:00]  Was chick  Does she want to get rid of it  I don't think she does  I don't know  I didn't ask her that  I never asked her that  I don't think  Does that work  When you get rid of it  That just seems like  It would be  I don't know  I think they  I think what they do  Is they  Jesus  Big bent suspension bridge dick  Her dick really does  Shame mine  It's upsetting to me  I think that would be  The worst part  Oh  God dude  You decide to go down  That road  But the she  Has the bigger dick  Must you 
[01:31:30]  Must you have  Everything dear  That would suck  Bell of the ball  In every way  I think they take  Your ball bag  And kind of  Shove it into your body  And that's how  They make your puss  No they  And then they  Keep a little bit  Of the cock head  Yeah they  Because that's where  It's real sensitive  They quarter your cock  And put it inside  They put it inside out  And they take your balls out  And then they  Fashion labia  Out of your scrotum  It's just got  It's got 
[01:32:00]  I mean  You think a regular pussy stinks  Like construction zone  Down there  You gotta get a real artist  Pussies are self-cleaning  Is what happens  Like they're supposed to be  Like an oven  Yeah yeah yeah  Like pussies are self-cleaning  Nice  That's the best they can do  I know right  Well yeah  It's not easy off  But the  But a dick turned inside out  Isn't gonna really  Be self-cleaning  You're gonna have to  Get up in that shit  What are they  Scrub it out  With one of those  Little brushes  You used to clean  The bottles out with  What are they  Self-cleaning themselves 
[01:32:30]  With soft soap  The shittiest soap available  It's not working  It's your own  You know  Bacteria and things  Get in there  And kind of  You know  The good bacteria  And kind of  Clean up things  They clean things up  We're gonna have to  Get her in here  She's great man  She's a blast  And she's got a  You know  She's very open  Like she'll  She'll talk about stuff  And she's got a good  Sense of humor  She's not  You are in love man  Well I will  I will say this  I said to her yesterday  On the podcast 
[01:33:00]  Like she's married  Her husband's really cool  And I was like  You know what guys  I just feel like  I met like  A cool couple  You guys are really cool people  Like I wanna hang out  With you guys  I bet you do  You just  I bet you do  Yeah  They're just really cool people  She's really fucking cool  Like I like her a lot  Would he get naked  With both of them  Huh  Would he get naked  With both of them  Not the husband  No  No no  He could watch  Great dude  Yeah that's crazy  Right  But no  Well he's a dude  That's where  That's where your line is  One penis  Because he's a dude  Two is 
[01:33:30]  That's crazy  That's crazy  Talking about  How far  How far do you run your hands  Before like  Like you know  Up the leg  And down the side  And over the ass  And then you're just like  You're trying to avoid  That hard dick area  And what  It brushes  A little brush  And then you're all in  Maybe  Maybe I'm not trying to avoid it  I do love  I do love this topic  Because it's so  Confusing  To understand  It really is confusing 
[01:34:00]  It's  Dude  It's a whole new  Wild card  Has been thrown into the mix  In the last 15 years  And they're  And  It's like adding a 53rd card  To the deck  Yeah  It's just like  What is  What  Do I play this thing  What  This whole new thing  But  You know what's funny though  Is her husband  Like when  She said  Whenever you see her  Fucking a guy  A POV  In one of her videos  And she's fucking a guy  It's her husband  Oh  So I was like  Dude I go  I can't watch any of the videos  Where it's a POV 
[01:34:30]  Because I know it's you  You know what I mean  It's like knowing it's your buddy  Is like fucking  You're like  That's funny  I know that guy  You don't like that  It kind of ruins it  Do you like watching your friends  Cock in a video  Nah I wouldn't  Next time you talk to her  You gotta ask if her penis  Is bigger than her husband's  I think they're pretty  Comparable  I've seen both of them  I think they're pretty comparable  How have you seen all this penis  In the video  Oh in the movies  Yeah yeah  In the video they did  I think they're pretty comparable  Listen  We got Florentine and Russell Peters  They're gonna join the show  After the break  But before 
[01:35:00]  I just wanna play this one fucking clip  From Rick Perry  Because everyone's talking about it  Oh yeah  Yeah this is the one  When I said  Did you watch the debate  I mean  Who gives a fuck in general  But Rick Perry  Had a complete meltdown  And he will absolutely  Not be the next president  Of this fine country of ours  Yeah you don't wanna do this  During a debate  It was obvious before that  I mean his numbers were dropping  But he is so out of it now  It's not even  Not even funny  It's not a debate  I'm not gonna debate you Jerry  I wouldn't be surprised  If he just bows out now  I wouldn't be surprised  In the coming weeks  He just says 
[01:35:30]  You know  I'm done  This is it  I've known about this guy  Since I lived in Texas  And worked for the senate in Texas  He was the governor then  And he just  Worked for the senate  What's his deal  Everyone was trying to figure it out  On twitter last night  Some people were suggesting  He might  Might have had a few cocktails  Before the debate  Others are suggesting  He might  Might pop a Xanax  Or something  Well I'll tell you  Dude  I lived  When I lived in Austin  And worked  And worked there  People  People that worked in politics  In Austin would say  They hated  They hated Bush  They hated him  And they would always go 
[01:36:00]  God damn  This fucking country  Thinks Bush is a moron  Oh they  They don't know shit  They don't know shit  Compared to Rick Perry  I mean  And I don't  I never knew what he did  I mean the governor in Texas  Isn't the real power player  The lieutenant governor  Is really the guy  So he was just this face man  I was like  Alright he's a good looking guy  He's got a good tan  He wears a good suit  Makes sense to me  That this is the guy  That made it into office  He's you know  He's got a little bit  Of charisma to him  He's got that down home boy 
[01:36:30]  Who  Perry's got charisma  I mean he's got  He's just got that  Down home  You can't communicate though  You know whatever  He's just got that  That fucking  Robert Wagner vibe to him  You know what I mean  I get that point  Yeah yeah yeah  But then when he opens his mouth  He kind of blows it a little bit  Yeah well  He's pretty special man  Look it's like  This stuff is like  They take the minor league players  And they throw them out  Into the majors  All of a sudden  And they're like  You're not ready  For this sport bro  And the problem is  Now he can't be president 
[01:37:00]  He's not  No one will elect him  And I don't think  Anyone can pick him  As a VP now too  Let's hear that  Oh yeah sorry  So this is how  It went down last night  On CNBC  My flat tax  Is the only one  Of all the folks  These good folks  On the stage  It balances the budget  In 2020  It does the things  To the regulatory climate  That has to happen  And I will tell you  It's three agencies  Of government  When I get there  That are gone  Commerce  Education  And the  What's the third one there

[01:42:00]  We'd do our taxes  We would get a refund  It's amazing  We would get a nice refund Joe  Jesus Christ  A nice one  There's no way  Come on  And I don't know if he was half joking  But then we'd  I would  We would go separately  But I would sign all my tax forms and stuff  And he goes  Well  Let's hope for the best on this one  And then he would stamp it  And then put it in a pile  Because he was sending it in  And he was wearing clown nose  Girls girls girls  Or something  That would have been better  Well he put the clown nose on  Just to kind of be silly  But there were clowns all over the office 
[01:42:30]  He was a really  He was a solid dude  Would he fill out your forms  In his own feces  He sounds like a fucking lunatic  He was  He then later died  Yeah  From what?  From not having us as clients anymore  Yeah yeah  Chlamydia from the strip club  Next door  He kept eating the steak  It was  From the strip club buffet  Strip club buffet  Ew  I felt bad when we  Many years ago  We had to be more  On the up and up  Yeah  And it was  It was suggested strongly 
[01:43:00]  That maybe we  Need to find another guy  That was a sad day  I just knew  Because I did like the guy  And he probably  It was probably all legal  It was out of his league  I don't even know  We reached a point  Where we became  Out of his league though  Yeah  Like when we were still  In his league  It was fine to have  Do our taxes  It was silly dumb money  Yeah  Like you got Joe  It was like stupid  Regular people money  Yeah  Yeah basically  Hold on  I have to go to the bathroom  And cry for a little while  Joe you're on your way though sir  Yeah  You're gonna have these 
[01:43:30]  Very problems  If this is on my way  I'd hate to see  What doing bad is  Hey  Did you ever go to that  Strip club  After doing your taxes  Oh hell yeah  Yep  Yeah I used to  It used to be  The Inn at the Crossroads  It was called  I don't even remember the name  I actually got married  In that place  Oh that was the basement  Jesus Christ  No that was the bar  That was up there  It's so weird  That it didn't  You're so mafia  It's so weird  That it didn't work out  Yeah I know  I can't believe that  Marriage  Met in a bar  Married in a strip club  Yeah but it was on the 
[01:44:00]  Taxes  Strip club  And you could get married  All in the same building  Yeah  That's so mafia man  Jesus Christ  Yeah what was the place called  It was called  The Inn at the Crossroads  It was right where Jericho  And Vets  Yep  Split in Comac  Right by the Comac Motor Inn  The Inn at the Crossroads  Yes  How dare you give it  Some sort of a  Sophisticated name  Well let me tell you something  In any sense  At first  When I first started going there  It wasn't a strip club  It was just a fucking  What was it a ground round 
[01:44:30]  No it was a  A Roy Rogers  What was it  It was just a decent buffet  It was just a local bar  That guys from  Like the demo in that place  Was probably  Businessmen  And guys in their  40's  And 50's  Would go there  And my mom used to  10 bar there  In the day  And I would come in  From knocking 10  Which was down Jericho  Turnpike  I'd come in  And everybody would be like  Hey get Rosie's Kid a drink  Get Rosie's Kid a drink  And I would sit there  And drink for nothing  All day  Because everybody would buy  Rosie's Kid a drink 
[01:45:00]  Were you 21  Yeah  Oh okay  I thought you were saying  When you were like a kid  No I was early  That was other bars  It was late teens  Early 20's  Kind of a thing  You just get bombed  At your mom's bar  Yeah  I would sit there  Drink beer  Talk with the fucking guys  And shit like that  Right  And then that was that  And then  She left  And then the place  Closed down  And then they turned it  Into a strip club  Oh it was a good location  Yeah it's a great location  Great location for a strip club  But before that happened  Like when she was still  Working there  We needed a place  You know to get married 
[01:45:30]  So I figured  You know that was convenient  And yeah  Were you still trying  To get hooked up  After returning to a strip club  We were walking  I'm Rosie's Kid  I'm Rosie's Kid  Give me a lap dance  12 bucks for this  Warm Budweiser asshole  Shit  But I'm Rosie's Kid  Brother Joe  Yeah  Yeah it's a gentleman  It's a gentleman's club  Now that's where  The accountants  Oh a gentleman's club  It's still a strip club  I love that term  Gentleman's Club  Gentleman's Club  Gentleman's Club only means  That the chicks  Are going to come up to you  And try to drain you 
[01:46:00]  For 20 bucks at a clip  Instead of a dollar a clip  Yeah  When they used to just  Walk around the bar  If you're making  Cumzies in your pants  Are you really a gentleman  Yeah exactly  So rarely do you hear  Gentlemen scream  Show me your asshole  You cunt  Right  Yeah  What's up Joe  There are still people  The lady that took over  For the old accountant  I was using him  For a while too  And the lady that took over  For him  She told me that  There are major  Major messes 
[01:46:30]  That she's still  Cleaning up  Oh from his accounting  When he died  Yeah yeah yeah  When he died  All of his accounts  Went to her  Oh man  Including mine  And I got a lot  Of inside info  On  On  Like oh my god  I can't believe  That guy did this  That bad  On everybody's  Everybody's  Taxes  He was always working  Within the parameters  That were set up  By the government  Oh yeah  Yeah sure he was  Fuck man  He was really good  For the guy 
[01:47:00]  That didn't make  All that much  That wanted  To keep a lot of it  That no red flags  Are going to pop up  If you're  You know making  Like alright money  And he would get you  Back some money  No red flags  But if you're making  A fuck load of money  And you're getting  A shit load back  Ding ding ding  Yeah yeah  She's still cleaning up  After him  I mean big time  And he's been dead  For how long  A couple of years now  A few years  Yeah  It's been a while  It's been a while  He actually died  He died on the table  He went in for 
[01:47:30]  Back surgery  Oh that's right  I thought you meant  The table dance table  He died on the table  Why do people die  On the table like that  What happens  It was the anesthesia  I think right  Was it  Something like that  I'm not sure  They never said  Exactly what it was  I just hate  When you  You know  You talk to doctors  Are you allergic to anything  You just  You say no  And then like  Alright well  It's like I don't know  And then they do something  That could kill you  Because I don't know  I don't know for sure  What I'm allergic to  I have no clue  Yeah and it's always 
[01:48:00]  Just don't take my word for this  Are you allergic to penicillin  I don't think so  And it's  But like  It's so fucked up  When it'll be like  He had a bean allergy  And that caused this  You know  What the fuck  Does dad have to do  With anything  You know what I mean  Still walks the earth  Right  Sal still walks the earth  And he was the guy  You know  The accountant was the guy  That was always talking about  Being in shape  And running  And jogging  Oh right  Yeah yeah  He was always into like  You know  Staying in shape  He goes in for one operation  Sal's had his heart removed  And replaced like 18 times  And he's still walking 
[01:48:30]  And he's still walking  You know  Yeah  Yeah  The operations they give  The old guys  Are just amazing  Yeah  It's fucked up  It's crazy  Yeah I don't know  That anesthesia shit  It's no fucking joke man  No some people  Just don't come out of it  But you gotta figure  That's gotta be the way to go though  You just kinda  You take that breath  You go to sleep  And then you just  You're done  Way to go  Why  Would you rather have  Some horrific fucking knifing  Where you're bleeding to death  On the street  Knowing it's over  Watching your blood 
[01:49:00]  Pump into your face  Yeah  I'm gonna go with  Gang rape in an alley  Rape to death  Would be my first choice  Or drowning  Or a shark attack  What the fuck  Are you looking for Joe  No go  Choking on a tranny cock  Please  Take it  Take it  No I'll tell you  I wanna go  I wanna  I wanna go with the compound  At a shootout  That could happen  That's a cool way  Had a few robberies  Around that place  Anthony is handing out guns  That would rock  Zombie invasion  Oh Christ  I can't wait for the day 
[01:49:30]  When your house  Is like the climax  Of red state  Kevin Smith's gonna appreciate that  That's awesome  What's that Joe  Did you get the pictures  That I texted you yesterday  Oh yeah  Picked up a couple of weapons  Did you  I like the Walter  Yeah the Walter's sweet  It's a black one  That's nice  Yeah yeah yeah  Nice  Yeah we're gonna have to  Hit the range up  9mm curts  It's like made after  It looks just like  One of the old German ones  Yeah  Yeah gonna have to  Hit the range  And I got the scope  I got the Nikon M223 
[01:50:00]  The one that's matched  For the AR-15  Yeah for the AR  Right  We'll hit the range up  It'll be fucking fun  Alright  Yeah we'll definitely  Go out there  Hey this weekend  To you  Is gonna be over  At the Maryland Irish Festival  In Timonium  At the Cow Palace  We're going on  At 9 o'clock  We're headlining it  Saturday night  Where is that?  The Cow Palace  Over in Timonium  Maryland  Okay  It's the Baltimore  Maryland Irish Festival  No fuck  That sounds cool  Cool man  Bunch of drunks  Alright Joe  It should be fun  Alright man  Later  Bye  Bye  You know 
[01:50:30]  Speaking of like  When they put you under  Yeah  That's all you need to know  That there is no gut  Sorry to blow it up  For everybody  You can read all the books  You want  But as soon as they put you under  I had a minor  They had a  I had a horrible  Last reflex thing  So they had to scope  My gut  To make sure  Everything was cool  And they put you under  And you don't realize  That time went by  That's when you realize  Holy fuck  There's nothing  Yeah  Take that with you today  Yeah  Because why aren't you 
[01:51:00]  At least in some kind of  Dreamy fucking state  Oh you're completely unconscious  Your brain is shut down  The guy went with  The famous  Count backwards  To  We're done  Yeah yeah  What  Yeah  Anesthesia is weird like that  You just  You wake up  You don't remember  Going to sleep  And then you're just  Waking up  So  Like in a second  In the meantime  They're fucking  Rattling you around a table  And fucking  Shoving shit  That's why there are  Fucking doctors  I mean that's amazing to me  That an anesthesiologist  It's like there's a doctor 
[01:51:30]  Dedicated to just the anesthesia  Making sure  You're fucking  Just watching the numbers  Yeah  Which is like  That guy's like the fucking guy  That works in the  Post office during the war  Like you're not a  Get the fuck out of here  Rookie  The post office  Hey I'm in uniform too  You know  I'm holding down the home front  Is what I'm doing  Ah there might be a guy  She's no actions  Got no stories  No  No good stories  One time we had a fright  When we were  Injecting the  Shut up 
[01:52:00]  Yeah meanwhile  There's fucking  People getting off of those  Amphibious landing  Crap  He's blown to bits  And he's like  It's pretty tough here too  Let me tell you  Talk to me when you've had  Somebody's brain on a  Fucking table  Anesthesiologist  No walk in the park  Here in the post office  Ah maybe there's a god  Maybe there is  There's no god  Maybe the anesthesia  Just knocks down the soul  There's no god  The soul's just hanging outside  I don't know  There's no god  Come on  I don't fucking know  It's  It is creepy though  When they put you under  And the next thing you know  Where you're like  Where the fuck 
[01:52:30]  Did that time just go  Yeah  Lost time  Completely lost  Because even when you're sleeping  You're aware that you're still  Fucking breathing  But you make a great point  When you sleep  You dream  Right  Right  There's no like deadness  Even if you don't remember it  You dream  Emptiness  You go under anesthesia  You're not dreaming  Because that is the closest to dead  Your body can be  That's what I'm thinking  In a alive state  It's nothing dude  It is blackness  Alright  Just nothing  You get freaked out  Alright  What's the matter  Alright  It's too much  No 
[01:53:00]  And they could  They could literally do that  I'm not even years old anymore  I could almost  They could literally do that to you  For quite some time  And you'd wake up and be like  I don't know  What is it  A week  A month  A year  And you wake up  How long was I out  The doctor smelling his finger  Nothing  10 minutes  Nothing  How you doing  You feel okay  But guys  We don't know everything  Who knows  Who knows  What do we know  I want to keep a little hope alive  Keep hope alive  It scares the shit out of me dude  It scares the shit out of me  I'm so scared about death  But is death a big deal 
[01:53:30]  If it happens to everybody  It did  It scares the fuck out of me  I'm talking about it  In my act a lot now  Like where I'm so scared  But it happens to everybody  So why  It shouldn't be a big deal  But that's why it scares me  Like I don't believe in God  And I'm terrified of death  And people go  That doesn't make any sense  Why would you be scared  Because you would just be dead  And you wouldn't even know  I go  That's why I'm fucking scared  If I knew that this was going to go on  If I had faith that there was a God in the heaven  I wouldn't be scared of death at all 
[01:54:00]  Yeah  It's like what  I get to go to a way better place  Like who gives a shit  But maybe  I don't give a fuck  But maybe that's why it's set up that way  Because if you knew there was something after this  Man  Everyone's life would be so different  A lot of people just  Yeah yeah  Your life would be so different  There's nothing to lose  Yeah I guess you're right  I mean  People would be offing themselves  And shit like that  Like without the religious aspect of suicide  You can't get into heaven  Kind of a thing  But if it's not religious  It's just some kind of a thing  And there is another afterlife  If you were really fucking up in this one 
[01:54:30]  Wouldn't you just cash in your chips  And go somewhere else  Well the whole catch is  You're not allowed to commit suicide  Well that's it  But that's a religious based thing  I'm just talking sheer  You know  There is something else after this  It doesn't necessarily have to have  This set of rules like religion  So if you were fucking up in this life  Wouldn't you just go  Fuck it  I'll go to the next one  See if I can  Yeah  I'm picking up  I'm going to another table  I'm going to go to another game  Relax  We're losing here  Yeah we're losing  I'm bleeding chips  If you believe  There is a place 
[01:55:00]  For even the suicide  You know  The people that committed suicide  Look I think  If there is a God  Up there in heaven  You know  There would be  A very very very very  Very small percentage  Of people  That wouldn't make it up there  Because I think  If there was this  All knowing  All powerful  All understanding being  There would be  Very few people  That he wouldn't  Let off the hook  Because he would be able  To follow the chain of events  In their lives  That led them to the  Ill behaviors  That they committed  Now you're talking crazy  What did you do  What did you kill someone 
[01:55:30]  Are you rationalizing this  What did you do  What demons do you have  What did you do  You know  You're not going to happen  How do we start this break  What did he  He sucked the dick  Which is against  The Bible  God said man  We should not lay  With another man  God damn  I don't think that's in the Bible  Has tits  Has fabulous titties  Yeah  Yeah  And it's alright  Lovely ass  We got a break  Because Russell Peters  Is here  Everyone's backing up  We got Florentine here  I wanted to do the montage  Can we do this fast 
[01:56:00]  Montage  With Rick Perry's  Fumble there last night  MSNBC just did a great thing  They went way  They went way back in time  All the other politicians  Grabbed a few faux pas  Fucking around  Okay  And fumbling  We might have to stop this  Because there's some funny things in here  Listen to this  Governor  If Kitty Dukakis  Were raped  And murdered  Would you favor  An irrevocable death penalty  For the killer  No I don't Bernard 
[01:56:30]  I have as much experience  In the Congress  As Jack Kennedy did  When he sought  The presidency  Senator  I love this one  I served with Jack Kennedy  I knew Jack Kennedy  Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine  Senator  You're no Jack Kennedy  Who am I?  Why am I here?  You know  Lifting whole passages  From someone else's speeches  Is not change 
[01:57:00]  You can believe in  It's change  You can Xerox  And I just don't think  No but you know  But Barack it is  Because  If you know  If you look  And thank you  You know what I hate about that clip  Yeah Hillary  They work together now  Yeah now they work together  They love each other  It's all a bunch of bullshit  No shit  That's what I've been saying  For years  It's all bullshit  These guys have to attack each other  And then when it's all over  They're working together  Like palsy-wowsy  You mean I wasn't  I wasn't making a huge  Original stand  When I said that  I'll tell you  Politics is a bunch of bullshit 
[01:57:30]  You heard it here first  The audience gasps  During  During the last election  You were convinced  Hillary Clinton  And Barack Obama  Hated each other  And now they work  Really close together  They did  Closely together  This fucking thing  It's ridiculous to me  You get into office  You get into office  Because you have  Some sort of a regime  Some sort of  You know platform  To stand on  And people go  I agree with that  And they put you in office  Once you're in office  You gotta keep  Your fucking job 
[01:58:00]  No matter what  Yeah that's just  Keep your job  It's like being a movie star  These people make  Shit loads of money  For not having to do  A ton of hard work  They get to live  Very glamorously  Once you get a taste of that  You're like  I'm fucking sticking around  I gotta keep this rolling  Yeah  Look at the debate last night  They go at it a little bit  Right  And then eventually  Whoever's gonna be the guy  Let's say it's Romney  He's gotta pick one of those guys  To be his VP  And he was beating him up  During the debate season  Yep  Right  It doesn't make sense  Yeah it's a bunch of bullshit  Here's the last faux pas  This one's great  This woman 
[01:58:30]  I don't even know her  She had a bertation  Big time on live TV  Thank you all for watching us tonight  I have  Done so much  We have done everything  That we could possibly do  She's just looking at the camera  Like a retard  Jesus  Yeah  We have  Oh my god  She's just like  Breathing heavy

[02:04:00]  And everything  And then they went through a phase  Where you couldn't find fucking good porn  Because everything was on pay sites  Yeah  You could see little thumbnails  Yeah  Of fucking blurry thumbnails  To jack off to  And that shit  And then it opened up to  Free streaming movies  Of fucking  Every kind of cum shot  Yeah  Fucking  All categories  Lobster tube  You ever heard that  Yeah  What?  Lobster tube  Really is that a good one?  Oh my god  You got whatever you want  Fucking  Lobster tube  I don't think you've ever heard of that one  It's got every single fetish

[02:06:30]  What are you  Norton?  For one  One in particular  And he's saying it's not gay  We're just trying to understand it  That's all  Well her name's Bailey J  And Robert Kelly's a podcast  And we interviewed Bailey  On his podcast  And I was  I was swept away by her  I was just  And you know  I've never been  Into dudes  Or anything like that  It was just this chick  I just was swept away  And they're trying to wrap  Their heads around it  But so am I  I'm trying to figure  We're going through this 
[02:07:00]  Journey together  Does she still have a cock?  Yes  Yeah well  Where are the pictures?  It doesn't bug me  I'm just like yeah  I don't care  We took a different angle  Instead of just beating  The shit out of Joe  We're trying to understand this  Thank you  She's not on hormones  Just so you guys know  And she's got really nice implants  And she's got a big dick  Yeah  It still gets hard  Looks like one of these  Geeky  Looks like a geeky girl  With the straight black hair  And bangs  And like pigtailish  And kind of  That weird looking  Cute face  She's very like suicide girls 
[02:07:30]  Like that kind of look  Yeah yeah yeah  She's fucking slender body  Smoking hot  You couldn't find the exact same chick  Without the  God damn  What a great point  We spent an hour  What a great point  We spent an hour  You know there are a dime a dozen  Out there those girls  Russell P is a snail dick  The exact same chick  Fuck  I think her dick  That's a brilliant  I think her dick gives me a shot  Is that what it is?  You know where you're right  Yeah I think it made me get  But she  I don't have her  She's married  Are you saying the dick 
[02:08:00]  Makes her lower her standards  Probably a little bit  She married to a guy or a girl  I said on stage  She's so hot  Even having a cock  Doesn't bring her down to my league  That's how fucking hot she is  I mean sure  Realistically  Would you hook up with her  If you were like  You would  If she wasn't married  And she wanted to hook up with me  I'd hook up with her in a second  But here's the thing  Now what would you do with the dick  That's the thing I don't know  That's what he hasn't really answered yet  I don't know  I think it seems like  You would because  It's not attainable  Once you're in the moment  You would fucking do anything 
[02:08:30]  But the second you came  You'd feel so ashamed of yourself  That's true  And then start questioning a lot  Because you'd have  Come all over you  From her him  From her him  And then you'd be like  Oh it's so hot  And then you'd come  And be like  Ugh  And you'd think of dead relatives  That are watching you  Oh dude  You know  They're like  Oh yeah  Don't worry  You know  Oh  Your mom died  Or something  But you're graduating  And I know she's watching  Looking down on you  It's like  What about the times 
[02:09:00]  You're fucking  Sticking something up your asshole  And fucking  You know  So dead uncles  Looking down  Oh Jesus Christ  Oh no  Maybe my pop-up  Would go  Yeah it's okay kid  Pop-up wouldn't mind  It wasn't easy over there  In Normandy  We did what we had to do  To get by  During that war  Well would you  Would you  Would you  Would you  Would you  Would you  Would you  Would you  Would you  Would you  Would you take  Her jizz on your face  Some of those French girls  Weren't girls  Would I take jizz on my face  Would you take  Her jizz on your face  I don't think  I'd take jizz on my face  No  That's where you  I think I'd  Grab her cock  And see how I felt about it  Yeah 
[02:09:30]  Like a telephone  You just  Like a stick shift  Yeah yeah  Like a stick shift  I don't think  I could drive this car  Take her on the block  Yeah  I'm not a manual guy  When we  When we interviewed her  On Bobby's podcast  I like got  Like kind of dressed  Like I wanted to look good  Because I didn't know  She was married  And I had a little thing for her  And I walked in  And Bobby goes  Look at  Look at his shirt dude  Look he fucking got  Dressed up for you man  Bailey do you like this shirt  And she goes  I'd fucking ruin that shirt  I would just make that  My fucking cum rag  Wow  And then I got a lot of shit 
[02:10:00]  For that because I'm  Not only is she a chick  With a cock  But I'm also the bottom  In the fucking equation  Like I can't even be  The top in this thing  You'd have to be  Power bottom no less  But then  Then we added Buck Angel  To the equation  You guys know who Buck Angel is  Yeah that's the guy  With a cunt  Yeah yeah  But he  He started out as a  As a chick  Now that  So what's gayer  Is what we were trying  To figure out  Now you bed down  With Buck Angel  Who is a man's man  With a real vagina  Technically still a woman  Technically  Now  Bailey 
[02:10:30]  Is a pretty girl  But technically a man  With a cock  What's  What's worse  And what would you  Rather  If forced at gunpoint  Which one would you  Rather bed down with  I'd take Buck  The snatch  You would take  The snatch  Now that's a man  No but  Buck Angel looks like Anthony  No more manly than me  Buck Angel's ripped  Yeah Jim  She literally  He looks like Stone Cold  With a pussy  I wish someone was in here  Turning the fucking computer on 
[02:11:00]  So he could see the goddamn  Fucking pages  How did you look at the Indian guy  When you should turn on the computer  Oh shit  Customer service  With man tattoos  Sure it is  I still think  Those big over the top  Man tattoos  Fucking  Obviously steroids  So he's really  Get Bailey J up  And get Buck Angel up  I don't know if you should  Answer the question  Before you saw  What this looks like  I think I could  I could close  I put my dick in  Bad holes before  Jimmy  I have  So I think  I can  I used to fuck the pool  Like the suction thing  In the pool  When I was a kid 
[02:11:30]  Stick my dick in there  Anywhere  Yeah but that suction cup  Didn't have muscles  If I felt another cock  That'd be a problem  Alright here's your choices  Okay  You got Bailey on the right there  See I could see the man in Bailey  You can  No  Well yeah  Besides the cock and balls  That's not the best picture  The Kirk Douglas chin  She's smoking man  It's a pretty  It's a pretty strong jawline there  That's why  Alright  This is your choice  Buck Angel  Now Buck's got the  This is your fucking choice  Alright there  Buck's got the vagina  This is your choice  Alright I'm going with the dick  I'm going with Bailey 
[02:12:00]  Yeah  I'll take a load to the face  I'm not fucking that guy  In tattoos  That's a guy  That's a guy  That's more guy  See but now that is  Technically a woman  Look it's got a vagina  Yeah the one on the right  Was born a woman  And then the one on the left  Was obviously born a man  Now I think  I think I gotta go  With Florentine on this one  I could not ever  At gunpoint  Be with that tattooed 
[02:12:30]  Fucking biker guy  But here you go  With a vagina  You gotta touch genitals though  You have to  You can't avoid shit  You can't avoid shit  What's the line  What you would normally  Do with a woman  Well I can't fuck  What do you mean  Ass fucking  Alright  Anthony would you blow  Blow her on that  Or fuck the guy  With the tattoos  Or buck  Oh god  That's weird  Can buck roll over  And you gotta swallow  Oh god  Come on 
[02:13:00]  No you gotta  That's the rules  I think that's the rules  I think I gotta fuck buck  Really  Yeah yeah  I think I gotta fuck buck  Oh dude I couldn't do it  How are you drinking  A man's cum  It's true  Oh I couldn't fuck  That vagina  It's like a fucking  Car accident victim  Look picture a girl  That was in a fire  It burnt all her tits off  In her hair  Well let me  Now you're fucking  Except the mustache  Yeah the mustache  Let me ask Florentine  Can you close your eyes  Absolutely  No way  Well that changes things 
[02:13:30]  No you got those  Fucking clockwork orange things  In your eyes  You gotta keep your eyes  Wide open  You gotta keep your gulipers open  Because if you close your eyes  Game over  It's gonna feel like a vagina  Yeah but then I lose my rod  If I close my  If I have my eyes open  What  Oh my god  Why  Because you wanna be turned on  By Buck Angel's goatee  That he's sporting in that picture  I got  No I gotta ask you now  Would you suck  Listen  Suck  Bailey's dick  Until Bailey came in your mouth  Or would you fuck Buck Angel  I'll sum this up for you 
[02:14:00]  This is my final  Closing argument  Alright  Before we go to the jury  At fucking gunpoint  With popsicle sticks  And duct tape  I couldn't get a fucking hard on  If I had to fuck  Buck Angel  I couldn't  I could not  Fake a hard on  That could be very true  Right  Whereas  The flip side of the quote  Is I would skip  Happily into a fire  To fuck Bailey J  So you would swallow Bailey  Before you'd fuck Buck Angel  I wouldn't be into  Swallowing any J  No you have to  That's the thing 
[02:14:30]  Why are you making these rules  Florentine's rules  Because it makes it more interesting  Florentine's rules  It makes it way more interesting  Florentine's rules man  I'm not gonna argue  We're playing by his rules today  You know I think it really comes down to  Who would you rather fight  That's really the bottom line  That is true  I think I could knock out Bailey  Yeah that glass jaw there  Nothing worse than getting beat up  With a guy with a cunt  That would be a little degrading  Some fucking dude with a vagina 
[02:15:00]  But Buck Angel doesn't have  Like a cock to punish you with  So  That's true  That'd be weird to watch them two fuck  They should do a movie  She told me  She told me on her podcast last night  That she wants to do a movie with him  That would be interesting to watch  Like  He's got like  Buck Angel's got  Unusually small testicles  Are they?  I don't focus on them  Might be a cold room  Find a picture of Bailey  That's in like those shorts  One of those pictures  So you get more of a girly look 
[02:15:30]  And see if that changes  Anyone's opinion  You see a little more  More man in that picture  Can we not avoid  We're avoiding something  Mr. DeRosa has not answered the question  Yes Mr. DeRosa  Look  Yeah no  Yeah I'd  Yeah no  If I was doing  Fucking Buck Angel  And sucking Bailey  I'd suck off Bailey  Really?  That one  Take the hot load  Yeah that one  You would take the hot load  Yeah I'd take that over  Fucking Buck Angel  Cause I feel like  I'm fucking a man  With Buck Angel  That version of Bailey  I'm interested in  Yeah see  Alright but  If you do take the load 
[02:16:00]  From Bailey  You can't run the bathroom  And go spit it out  No  No  Jesus  Your rules are getting  Really fucking  I know  I just went out for  I know right  Jesus  If it's  Look do I want to  Do I want to get a load  In my mouth  No  But if it's between that  And fucking Buck Angel  I would  I would take the load  I'd take Bailey  Any day  I'd take Bailey  Just regular  Buck Angel's rough  Let alone up against  Buck Angel  Buck Angel's rough  It's rough  I just figure  With so many real girls  With real vaginas  Out there  Why are we fixated 
[02:16:30]  On these two fellas  Well that's what  That's why  It took so long  To get you guys in here  Sorry  So what happened  So what was your  Opie  There's no good answer there  What  Well what if you have to pick one  Yeah you have to  Jesus  I think I just closed my  I can't close my eyes  What do you mean  Close your eyes  You can't close your eyes  No you can close your eyes  I'll throw it in  Then the Buck Angel thing  Buck Angel  It'll feel like a vagina 
[02:17:00]  No but here's  No it won't  Because when you grab  The hips  Yeah  You're gonna feel  A hairy ass  Yeah that's true  Are you gonna be on top  Or how's that gonna work  Like you  You picked a position  Oof  What would  What would your answer be  Rule maker  Who wins in this  There's no  There's no good answer to this  I'm not playing this game  If I could pick  The whole  If I could pick  The entire thing  Here's what I would pick  Cover it up  Like it's having  Vagina surgery  Where everything's covered 
[02:17:30]  Except for that little hole  In the sheet  Like a Hasidic  Where just  Where just the vagina  Is showing  And then fuck like that  I would have  Hasidic sex  That's all I do  There you go  Buck Angel  There's my answer  That's it  There's no good answer here  And the same thing  With the asshole  Of Bailey J  I bet you  Buck has managed  To make his vagina  Smell like balls  I thought the same thing  It's gotta just  Reek like  Man ass 
[02:18:00]  It smells like cock  Balls and cock  Sweaty cock  Also here's the problem  With your  Hasidic sheet scenario  You can still hear  Through the sheet  So you're gonna hear  Her manly fucking grunts  Good job  You call that fucking  That's the problem  You guys can use  The Hasidic sheet  But if he turns around  And looks you in the eye  When you're fucking him  From behind  You gotta look at him back  Oh boy  That's a real gay moment  I think also  I don't think  I'm gonna be able  To keep her eye  Can you put a wig on Buck  That makes it too easy 
[02:18:30]  With a wig  And why is it a blowjob  With fucking Bailey  And not fucking  Because that's a no brainer  You'd bang a hot chick  In the ass  Any day of the week  Right  So you take Bailey  And bend her over  The bed  So you don't see  Any dick or anything  And then just  Tool her in the ass  Tool her in the ass  She's so hot  She could literally  As I was fucking her  Be dangling her dick  In my face like this  And I wouldn't care  Would you  Would you  Would you let Bailey  Look you're on your back  Bailey's on top  Jerking off 
[02:19:00]  And just arcs one  Onto your fucking face  Is that okay  I've had my own jizz  On my face  What's the difference  It's another man's  So that's okay  You would have to stare  You would have to stare  At the tits  As that's going down  Huh  You would have to stare  At the tits  As that's going down  Yeah I think she's  Who would you make out with  Cause that's way gayer  Oh Bailey  In a second  I'm just gonna  I would go out  On a date with her  That fucking cock  Is getting on my tits  Yeah I think I would  Make out with Bailey first  If I had to  Yeah  Oh dude 
[02:19:30]  You definitely would  Fucking Buck  What's his name  Buck Angel  He's got stubble and shit  He's gotta go t  And not on his cunt  Oh dude  That does look good  I'll give you  That's not bad  There's like hips  On that thing  I'm telling you  She's smoking  The hips don't look manly  Right  No no  The hips are round  And shit  And the face looks good there  And it's cool hair  Almost childbearing  Like  I don't know  Yeah  Or ball bearing  So confusing  If you  I'm telling you  If you talk to her  At a party  For hours  And hours 
[02:20:00]  And then somebody  Said to you  She's got a cock  You would not believe  You'd be like  Oh  No  Stop it  Lucky day  I don't believe you  Too good to be true  Florentine  Part of your rules  Does she tell the world  After it's over  Yeah but you could  Just deny it  Or as a comic  You could go  Yeah I did it  So what  For a goof  For a goof  I did it  Because I needed  20 more minutes  Yeah  Would you let  Bailey  Fuck you in the ass though  No  I don't  No I don't think  I'd be into that  If you guys 
[02:20:30]  Are rolling around  And hijinks  Were going on  I think if hijinks  Were going on  And she puts on  The little pouty face  And goes  Oh Joe  Can I fuck you  In the ass  You'd be like  Oh okay  Well you know me  With hijinks  Anthony  I would love  For her to trick  Joe DeRosa  And now she's  Fucking him in the ass  And just goes  I'm a man  You stupid fuck  What are you doing  Yeah the voice  Comes down  Comes down  You stupid fuck  I'm telling everyone 
[02:21:00]  What fuck are you doing  She becomes Olivia Octave  What are you doing  Yeah as  As her cocks  And she just leaves  And it goes  Gotcha  Another one of you  Fucking homos  As the Kutcher  Comes out  Wow that's a  Weird discussion  More rules from Florentine  Not good  I like this  Anthony knows  You're on a construction site  For hours  You're bored  So you just come up  With these games  And you just keep  Pushing it further  And further  Because you don't want  To be there  So it's just entertaining

[02:29:30]  You're getting killed  He's just reading tweets out loud  And we're dying  You're getting ass pounded on Twitter  Yeah  I'm getting more positives than negatives  Where the negatives are just making me laugh  These are really fucking funny  What are the positives?  Uh  I did say to  In all fairness  I did say to Joe DeRosa  If we went to the phones  And threw the question out there  I'm convinced hundreds of guys  Would agree with you  Nah  They'd all be like  If you pick up ten calls  I bet you  Seven are gonna say 
[02:30:00]  I wouldn't do it  Yeah  You think?  Yeah maybe three  I'm just saying  There's enough guys out there  That are on Joe's side  Yeah  But with that said  What are some of the tweets coming in?  Oh hold on  I gotta pull it up again  You think chicks would dig that?  Like  You think girls  A few girls got to Joe  A few girls got to Joe  Buy like  You know  You think chicks would like  Being with that girl  The fucking  Or the guy with the dick girl  Nah  I feel very confusing  Not Buck  This is my favorite one  Tex Punchem wrote  I'd love to fuck them both 
[02:30:30]  High five  High five  Yeah high five  That's a high five  Make it less gay  That one  Man's it up  Man's it up  Shane Nixon 1 wrote  Great job on O&A today  Mr. I don't mind a mule  Those are my two favorites  But this audience is desensitized  Because of Norton  So  This isn't that shocking 
[02:31:00]  Yeah he did  Desensitize a lot of people out there  We thank him for that I guess  The other thing  Which had me dying  Joe was talking about how  He was talking with Bailey  Right  He was talking with Bailey  And  A lot of guys apparently  Wouldn't mind  The  The dick  Yeah  On a hot girl like that  But a lot of guys don't want to say anything  Yeah she was saying like  That like  She had been in  Previous circumstances  Where like  She'd be at a bar  Talking to a bunch of guys  And they all knew  That she had a cock 
[02:31:30]  And you know  They were like  Well you're hot and all  But that's gay  And I wouldn't do that  Whatever  And then she said  It would always  Like dwindle down  To one guy  And that would finally be like  All right now that my friends are gone  I'd suck your dick  I'll suck my dick  I'll suck my cock  Look at what I said  Ten minutes ago  Yeah  I was just thinking  How fucked up it would be  To have two guys left  At the bar  That are friends  That want that dick  Right  And they're just  They're just  And they're waiting  Each other out  So you gotta get up early  For work  Don't you have to get up 
[02:32:00]  Real early  Someone expecting you home  And they're just kicking the floor  Another beer  I guess  And they're just both  Not leaving  Yeah  Not fucking leaving  I got my car  I'll drive you out of the city  Nah I'm gonna take a cab  Nah I'm good  I'm gonna hang  Nah  You take off  I'm gonna have one more beer  Nah I'll hang out too  I'll give you a ride  It's gonna cost you 70 bucks  For a cab  They're both just  Wanting that cock  Yeah  Yeah  That bathroom argument  Stuff  Fuck dude  What the fuck  Dude  You going for this or not  Because I'm going for it  Homo 
[02:32:30]  If we both did it  Would it still make us gay  Or would that  Two negatives  Equal a positive  Joe this isn't good  But Tom  NY on Twitter  Writes  Hear Joe DeRosa comedy  Come out of the closet  On OP radio  After the film  Replay on Sirius 206  At 3pm  This is gonna make  They're already promoting  The replay  They're promoting  The replay for us  Holy shit  If you want  We have our  The part two  You know what dude  Podcast  Robert Kelly's podcast  Comes out today  With the Bailey interview  So you'll hear 
[02:33:00]  Do numbers now man  Hear more about her  Subscribe to an iTunes  Hey I want to talk  To Florentine  About Axl Rose  Because I  I was  A massive  Guns N' Roses fan  Growing up  Massive  Yeah  And we finally got  To talk to this guy  Unbelievable  First of all  His new band  The band that he has  Is phenomenal  But  I know it's not the guy  Except for Dizzy Reed  The keyboard player  That played on  Use Your Illusion 1 and 2  Is the only original member  From back in the day  But does Axl still sound good  Unbelievable  He can still hit those high notes  Every note  Running around on stage 
[02:33:30]  Like a maniac  Great showman  Phenomenal  Did he look chubby  No that's what everyone  Was saying  Well there's pictures online  Where it's a fat Axl  It must have been  A bad picture of him  Or something  I don't know  From a different angle  Whatever it was  He's not fat at all  And then we got a clip  Where he wasn't  Hitting the high notes  So someone was  Trying to fuck him over  I guess  Well look  I mean  Some of those songs  Like he was saying  In the interview  It's like  Some of these songs  I regret singing  Like you could be mine  It's like all of a sudden  I gotta sing that live  I'm like you gotta be kidding me  It's tough  You know when you sing  That shit in the 20s  Now you're in your 40s  So you're sitting there 
[02:34:00]  And all of a sudden  Axl shows up  Are you freaking out  I know you've interviewed  A lot of big fucking musicians  This is the biggest one  Of course  He liked the show  We know he watched the show  Because we know some guys  In the band  He goes Axl watches your show  He likes it  And then we heard that  Yeah he might want to do  An interview  More of it was his management  Because his manager  Wants to get out there  They're doing a whole US tour  Right  So he's gotta get his face out there  And they go  Yeah come down to Miami  And we're playing  And bring the crew  And you're gonna get  An interview with Axl  Axl didn't notice  What was going on  I'm totally  100% sure of that 
[02:34:30]  So we get down there  We're waiting  4 o'clock in the afternoon  We're supposed to interview him  It doesn't happen  Until 5.40 in the morning  So we waited like  14 hours  So he's still up to his old trips  Making everyone wait  No but he didn't know  Well first of all  They didn't go on until midnight  They played until 3 in the morning  They played 3 hours  God damn  And we're hoping to get it  Before the show  What time was he supposed  To go on stage  Well you know  It doesn't help  What time is the show  But it was Miami  On a Saturday night  Saturday night's fine  Yeah  At the next night 
[02:35:00]  He went on 11 I heard  So he cleaned it up  Yeah he moved it up  But that was the  Daylight savings time  So he finally shows up  At 5.40 in the morning  5.40  Fuck  Are you tired at this point?  Bruto  Because you know  He likes to go to clubs afterwards  That's like his thing  He'll go to clubs  Somewhere in there  So South Beach  Is 10 minutes away  So we're like  After this show  He's not talking  To fucking three slobs  You know what I mean  He's going to go to South Beach  Just go hang out  And stuff  He was probably aware 
[02:35:30]  Right after the show  That he was going to  Talk to you guys  But made you wait  Because he had to  Do some clubbing  No he didn't go  To the club actually  He stayed backstage  But he didn't find out  Like at 3.30  We text one of the guys  In the band  And go  I just asked Axel  He has no idea  About this interview  Meanwhile we sent  A whole crew down  They were like  Fuck  He goes  No one told me  So now it goes back  And back  And you know  All of a sudden  Yeah he's taking a shower  He'll be there in 10 minutes  Yeah he's just getting ready  Another 20 minutes  And they finally just asked him  Like 20 minutes before  Hey there's an interview here  Just go talk to VH1  For a few minutes 
[02:36:00]  Motherfucker  And they walked in  He's like  What the fuck is this  He even said that  He goes  Dude I didn't know  It was interviewed  Until like 20 minutes before  Holy shit  Which I didn't care  Look I walked out of a strip club  Fucking drunk  And walked out of a plane  So basically we just  Went from the interview  To the plane  And went home  So I didn't care waiting  I saw a 3 hour show  And he was fucking  Really funny  And engaging  And just a good dude  He wasn't angry  He didn't say  Don't ask me this  None of that shit  He was just a really good dude  It's usually management  Who does that shit anyway  Yeah exactly  But none of that  They just said  He's coming in 
[02:36:30]  And just have fun with him  So you came away  With a good impression of the guy  Yeah if you guys  Watch the interview  You'll see  I can't wait  I'm gonna check it out  It's tomorrow night  VH1 Classic  11 o'clock  So he edited a lot of the shit  Not too much  No  But you know  He just said  Look as far as being laid  He goes look  I'm a perfectionist  There's a lot of drama  And it goes on before a show  I don't know exactly  He's like  I just need everything  To be perfect  Before I go on  He's a head case  A little bit  Yeah I mean  They do a sound check  Every night  So I don't know  What the drama is  You know  You get there  4 in the afternoon  Usually shows  Run pretty smooth  I feel like  A lot of these guys 
[02:37:00]  After a while  Could just do it  In their sleep  They're singing  The same songs  Night after night  Yeah  And he said  My school was right next door  I could see it on my window  And I'd be 30 minutes late  To that  I got a problem  He's being late  I'm sorry  That's funny though  He's like  I've always been late  But I put a kick ass show on  Did he talk about  The other guys  Like Slash and stuff  Well he didn't really  Talk about Slash  Slash is the one  He has the main problem with  The rest of the guys  Duff actually went on stage  In London with him  A few months ago  And jammed with him  For the first time in years  And they're friends now 
[02:37:30]  And Duff's solo band  Is going to do some dates  With guns  Shit  So they're going to open  That means Duff  Will do some guns  Songs too  Probably yeah  It'll come up afterwards  He said they hung out  They haven't seen each other  In 15 years  They hung out  Went to dinner after the show  And all that stuff  What's their beef  With Slash and him  I don't know  I think it's over  The music  And the rights  And the rights to the name  And all that stuff  And Axl just works  On his own time  And they want to put shit out  Get on the road  And Axl wants to take his time  Until the shit's right  So I think that's what it was  I think it's not as bad 
[02:38:00]  The feud  As anymore  You gotta think  They're all gonna get back together  Well the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  They're up this year  Oh really  Yeah  They're on the ballot  For the first time  So if it's gonna happen  It should be a good time to do it  You know we asked them about  What's gonna happen  Slash  We asked Slash on the show  Because Slash is gonna be on  He said look  I'm gonna be there  I don't know who else  Is gonna show up  And then Axl said  Hey we'll see who shows up  And who  You know if the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Who wants there  Slash is just about ready  These guys are  The original guys  Are gonna get back together  Slash is a pretty chill dude though  Yeah  He's a great  Yeah absolutely  He's a super guy 
[02:38:30]  But the thing is  Do Guns and Roses  Wait till like 11  12 o'clock to go on stage  That was a big problem  Back in the day  They didn't want to sit around  And make the fans wait  They're booing in between songs  And stuff like that  So Axl's set in his ways  He's not gonna go on stage  At 9 o'clock  So if they get back together  That shit's gonna go on again  Why don't they just change  The clocks on him  Well what I tell people  Is like look  I don't like to be at a venue  At 2 in the morning either  But you know what  If you know you're going  To see Guns and Roses  Show up at fucking 10.30 then  You deal  Why don't they  Because in the end  It's worth it 
[02:39:00]  Why don't they just make  The show time 11 o'clock  Why don't they just be like  We do late shows only  Instead of saying  It's gonna be at 8  Or whatever  Then that would mean  Axl comes on at 3  So it's in his head  He can't do it  I got what you're saying  Properly  I'm thinking  You know and there's also  Curfew fees  You know you go over at 11 o'clock  Grand a night  In curfew fees  That they gotta pay  Overtime and stuff  Right  Which is insane  But he was great on there  He definitely  He was telling  I said look man  There's a lot of  Untrue rumors about you  Out there  You never address  He's like  I just don't like  Talking to the media 
[02:39:30]  They fuck me over  And you know  He's just talking  About some of them  Stuff that  You know  Because I just hear  This shit every day  I just heard one last week  In the London Times  Or whatever  Saying I run over dogs  And I kill my dog  And I run around  My neighborhood  And just kill dogs  And everybody's  The fuck is that  I never heard that one  And everybody's on my Twitter  Going you fucking piece of shit  You're worse than Michael Vick  And he's like  I don't respond that way  He goes I should  And I go  Doesn't it bother you  He's like yeah  It bothers me  But I just  Eventually I let it go  But it's easier  Just to let it go  Right  Yeah  So we'll see  I mean hopefully  The guns gets back together 
[02:40:00]  But he was great man  Yeah that's a big  That is cool man  He didn't get to walk out  Any of that shit  He was really funny too  After that long  Of not sitting down  And actually having an interview  That's a coup  You figured he'd be real guarded  You ever see De Niro  In an interview  He's terrible  Oh he's horrible  Yeah so we thought  That's what it's going to be  The same stock answers  But he opened up  And you know  And all that stuff so  But he probably trusted you guys  Because he knows  Your musical depth  Your knowledge goes deep there  You know  Look  You guys know  Coming on a show  It's like  You finally get somebody  You don't want to just attack them 
[02:40:30]  Right  Because then they're never  Going to come back  Unless they're being dicks  If they're being dicks  Then you go after them  And he wasn't  So we weren't going to go  What the fuck dude  Why you make these guys wait  You know  You kind of  Yeah  You ask the question  In like a nice way  And then eventually  We knew the slash thing  Was going to be rough  To bring up  Yeah but  So he actually brought it up  He probably knows  Yeah you want to bring it up  You got to bring it up  Did um  What the fuck was I going to say  Oh did you get  Did you get a picture  Of course  That's like what Jimmy would say 
[02:41:00]  Did you get a picture  Yeah of course  Was it good  I got a picture  Did you get a sign  Yeah slash yeah  No I did get a picture afterwards  I made sure  I have my camera  Right next to my foot  The cameraman was like  Get that camera in a shot  I go no  Because I got to  Fucking grab it  As soon as it's over  Yeah  As Axl's taking his mic off  I'm right next to him  Yeah  So yes  I did get a picture  You know it's like  I'm not surprised  That he was cool  Like a guy like that  Would be cool with you guys  Even though he doesn't do  Press and all that stuff  Like you were saying  Because you guys are  So the real deal 
[02:41:30]  You know what I mean  It's like  I'm sure any musician  No matter how long  They've been around  In the field of rock  That you guys are  Enthusiasts in  Or whatever  Would see you guys  And go  These guys are the real deal  They're not annoying fanboys  They're not  Shitty press  They're not  You know  They're the real fucking deal  And you  Like talking to guys like you  Probably brings him back  To everything he got into music  To begin with  You know what I mean  You probably are like  Fuck I knew  I knew guys like this  Back in the day  So he sits down with you  He's really comfortable 
[02:42:00]  You know what I mean  You're not some fucking  Dumb chick from  You know  Some bullshit magazine  Going which one are you  Are you Izzy  You know what I mean  Or whatever  And if he watches the show  We don't attack the guests  You know  We'll ask some pertinent questions  If we have to  But we don't just attack them  So he knows  Alright these guys  Aren't going to be brutal on me  Yeah  So we feel like  The Barbara Walters  A metal  Yeah it's like  Sitting down with Tom Snyder  Or something  You know what I mean  He's really going to like  Dig into your life  And talk  Nothing  It's like when Tom Snyder  Interviewed Kiss in 79  Yeah  And Ace was hammered 
[02:42:30]  Tom Snyder gave a good interview  Dick Cavett  You know  Yes sir  Yes sir  Yes sir  Fucking just smoking  I was watching old clips  Of talk shows  And the amount of cigarettes  That were being smoked  During those  It was  My favorite one  Is on the Twilight Zone CDs  DVDs  The collection  They got interviews  With Rod Serling  On the David Susskind show  I have that  They're smoking  In this studio  At some points 
[02:43:00]  You can't see them  And I literally  Can't see them  The cameras  Are pulled so far back  It's a big studio  But they got ashtrays  They're both smoking  So much  And I think the crew  Is smoking and everything  And there was just  Rolling clouds  Of smoke  In the entire room  It's hilarious  It looks like an episode  Of the Twilight Zone  Of the Twilight Zone  Yeah yeah  Dude  My favorite thing  In that interview  Is you watch this thing  And you  Like I get really nostalgic  With show  But I'm like  Oh that was a better time  Yes  In television  What a simple time 
[02:43:30]  And then you watch  This interview from 1959  Or whatever  With Rod Serling  And he's going  This fucking business  Sticks  I'm done with these  Executives  They're morons  Every  It just sounds like  Comics at the Cellar  They're miserable  Yeah  I'll do this myself  I'll produce it  I'll do everything  Fuck them  Fuck them  It's good to know  The business is the same  The business never changes  Never changes  He literally says  In this interview  And it's on the eve  Of the Twilight Zone  Coming out  One of the greatest 
[02:44:00]  TV shows ever  And he literally goes  This is it  This is my last  Ditch effort  I don't care anymore  This is my last  And it becomes  The greatest thing  The guy ever did  But he is at the  End of his fucking rope  He's like  I can't stand  This business  It's insane  Angry Rod Serling  Bitter fucking  He's been run through  The mill  Rod Serling  Gotta see this now  Fuck  It's a good interview  Yeah it's cool  I go to YouTube  And watch like  A lot of the old 
[02:44:30]  Fucking 70s  Oh yeah  The Merv Griffin show  And Mike Douglas  Those clips are great  They're so hokey  And weird  I know but they  They seem to have more fun  On those shows  Yeah  It's more relaxed  Right  Now it's just about  Going on and plugging  Your shit  And you know  Playing your clip  There's no reason  To be on back then  No they just sat down  Hey look who's in town  Let's talk  Let's see what's up  Yeah look at who's here  With cigarettes  And booze in hand  And now you get like  You know someone  That goes on like  You know Letterman  Or whatever  Like Gwyneth Paltrow  And she talks about 
[02:45:00]  Her plane ride  Yeah  And she's not a comic  And it goes on  For like seven minutes  Just nonsense  There's not one  Not a good storyteller  Even hint of a joke  Nothing  But who was the guy  That took the cigarettes away  Someone had a walk in  One day and go  Look we can't have  That smoke  It can't be smoking  Someone had it  It's gunking up  Our video units  Well look what happened  With Kimmel  Remember Kimmel  When his show first came out  He's like we're gonna have  The guest drink  And the first night  Two audience members puked  And they go that's it  ABC goes no drinking  I gotta explain  I was part of that  Never was on Kimmel 
[02:45:30]  But I was hanging out  In LA for a while  And I would just hang out  In that back room  Because it was the greatest  Fucking party ever  Yeah pool tables  Pinball machines  Hot chicks  There were so many celebrities  That just showed up  That weren't even booked  For Kimmel  Just for the backstage shit  And then they were feeding  Like you said  The audience booze as well  It sucks  It was a great idea  I know  I wish you could still do  You watch those old  Like Dean Martin clips  Yeah  There's a Dean Martin thing  With Bob Newhart  Where Dean Martin  Is playing a wig salesman  And he fucking  Is just in the tuxedo 
[02:46:00]  Because he never changed  For any of the sketches  Why would he  He's standing as a wig salesman  In a tuxedo  Smoking a cigarette  Through the whole fucking sketch  And you're like  This was the shit  They're just dicking around  Well you want a wig  Do you  Yeah  He's laughing through  The whole sketch  They were horrible  Fuck this script  I'm here to smoke  And try to fuck  That blonde singing  These boots are made for walking  They just went with it  They just went with the whole program  Carson would do  All those fucking bits  The Mighty Carson art players 
[02:46:30]  You know  He'd do those bits  With the fucking hot blondes  And shit like that  That now would just be  So sexist  And racist  And everything else  And it was just hilarious  Now everybody's too worried  About what the fuck  Someone's going to say  You can't look at  Grant Ratner  He's doing a Q&A  At a friggin' wherever  A throwaway line  Somebody's videotaping  And now he's off the Oscars  What do you say  Rehearsing's for fags  Yeah  Rehearsal's for fags  Rehearsal's for fags  That whole  Eddie Murphy  Enough already  Resigned to him  He's not hosting 
[02:47:00]  Enough already  Now we lost  Fucking Eddie Murphy  Reason for what  Say him the word  No no  Eddie  Eddie's just  He's like  Ratner's guy  It seems like  He's sticking up for a Ratner  Ratner brought him in  I'm hoping that's what this is about  Brought him in as host  He was like  Yeah  Let's have Eddie host  So when he's gone  Eddie's like  Fuck this  I'm out of here  It's suck  It's such an immature  Fucking argument  Like it's unbelievable to me  That people would make  Such a stink out of it  And then I read this interview  Or this article about it  Where the guy that runs GLAAD  Or the president of GLAAD 
[02:47:30]  Goes  We sat down with Brett  And we talked to him  And his apology is just the first of many public appearances  He's going to make  Many public floggings  He'll have to fucking sit through  It's like dude  Literally sit you down like a 12 year old  Joe we've been on this for a while  They'll find someone  And then they'll take him hostage  They hold him hostage  They held fucking Tracy Morgan hostage  Tracy Morgan they got  We all know Tracy Morgan  Was that Tracy Morgan we saw on TV?  I know  Having to sit down with everybody  That was someone that was being held fucking hostage 
[02:48:00]  Would have gone  Would have to fly back to Nashville  Or wherever it was  And apologize to the crowd  That was there  Tracy Morgan?  I know  I mean please  My theory  My theory is that  That many of these organizations  Are non-profits  They get government funding  And in order to keep that easy money rolling in  They've got to make a stink every year  Oh yeah  And they don't want to make a stink over anything real  This isn't a real fight  If you're a gay rights proponent  Good  We need to have those  But fighting over Brett Ratner saying fag  And not meaning it like that 
[02:48:30]  Is not a fight for gay rights  It's a bullshit fight  And Joe as a gay guy  You weren't offended by that right?  Yeah exactly  You want to fight for gay rights?  Have a rally so I can suck a girl's cock  And not worry about it  Getting beat up afterwards  But was a cock loving straight man  Right right  I mean when Brett Ratner said  Rehearsals for fags  How many people really thought  That meant  You know  Nobody  That's my point  Oh a bunch of people that suck dick 
[02:49:00]  Especially our age  I've never looked at it that way  Every year like clockwork  This happened last year  With that Ron Howard movie  The Dilemma  Whatever it was called  Wearing the thing  Everybody knows smart cars are gay  Right  I don't mean gay like homosexual gay  I mean like dumb  Right  And they made a fucking huge stink about that  And they pulled the ads  And the movie fucking suffered  And it's like guys  You know  This is an easy stink to make  To say hey everybody  Look we're still doing our job over here  Please keep that money coming in 
[02:49:30]  The word has two meanings  It has two meanings  It's a derogatory term for gay people  And it's another word that everybody uses  As being something you know  Not quite up to fucking  Manly status  It's like the whole man up commercials now  Yeah yeah  That's the word  A guy goes  Oh you want to go to the bathroom with me  Oh come on man up  You know  So it's all the same  Like you're a fag  Don't be a fag  You want to go to the bathroom with me  When you tell your fucking friends  It's like hey  Let's go to the fucking bar tonight  It's like nah I want to hang out  It's like don't be a faggot  Get fucking 
[02:50:00]  Come on out  Right  It doesn't mean  Don't stay home  And have gay sex  Right  So I can come in  And beat you up  Wait a minute  When I catch you  That's not what that meant  No  I've been doing it wrong  This whole time  Wait a good boy  But it's like  It's got two distinct meanings  You know  One of them is  Derogatory  Which if it's used like  Hey I say we go out  And beat up some fags  Alright  That's  Now you got something  Joe  As a guy that sucks on man clit  Right 
[02:50:30]  Yeah  Right  No it's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's an incredibly  Immature argument  And the fact that we can't get  We can't come to terms  As a culture  With the fact that words progress  And words start to have different meaning  Booty being the classic example  Does not mean fucking pirate treasure anymore  Words change  And nobody's saying that there is not  Hatred or prejudice towards gay people  There is  But don't take things that aren't  Yeah  He didn't mean it like that 
[02:51:00]  It's about intent  Yeah exactly  You know the difference  Everyone knows what Ratner meant  Everyone gets carried away though  When you look at like sexual harassment in the workplace  It starts off as the boss saying  Sit on my lap  Suck my dick  I'll get you a better job  This that or the other thing  That's sexual harassment  Herman Cain  Yeah  When it's  When it's  You can't put some dumb fucking thing in your cubicle  That shows like you know  A scantily clad girl  Or a joke that you like in your cubicle  That's not fucking sexual harassment in the workplace 
[02:51:30]  It's so ridiculous  It's not  It's so fucking ridiculous  Yeah because a chick could put up fucking Brad Pitt without a shirt on  Of course  You know we gotta look at that every day  They just turn it into something  They go to the extreme level  Where it's not what it was supposed to be  It's not what it was intended to be in the first place  Which was really to help people  You know if there's any organization that wants to keep gay guys from getting their shit beat out of them because they're gay  I'm all for it  Fine  But if it's you know  All of a sudden now our language is being  Questioned  Fucked with  Well  And you gotta worry about having your job 
[02:52:00]  Our intent is being questioned  Right  With no intent  No ill intent against gay people  Of course  It's fucking ridiculous  Think about  Think about how  How fucking  Juvenile  And just  The Jews  Oh  How  How fucking trivial this really is  Okay  Brett Ratner said this thing  People got angry about it  What good did it do  To force him to step down from the Oscars  Nothing  One less gay person  That'll be beat up I guess  He stepped down from the Oscars 
[02:52:30]  But now  Everybody's happy with Brett Ratner  And going  Come on Brett  You're doing the right thing now  What the fuck did that have to do  Couldn't he just say sorry  And still kept his god damn job  No and that's the world we live in  You can't just say you're sorry  It's ridiculous  They need  Sorry means nothing  They need punishment  And repercussions  And some kind of  Thing  Your actions  Merit that  You now lose your fucking gig  It's ridiculous  Everybody can be bought  And if that's  If that's the  If your price only goes as high  As somebody not doing the fucking Oscars 
[02:53:00]  This isn't a cause  That's fucking embarrassing  Take a god damn stand  And if you're really mad at them  Go  Hey go fuck yourself Ratner  No  No  You're not on our team  You're a fucking asshole  But they won't do that  Because they're  It's mob tactics  Political fucking  Cocksuckers  No pun intended  And him excluded  Yeah  Takes one to know one  I guess  No it's just shit  It doesn't work  Isn't that the pot calling the kettle  A cocksucker  It does more damage  Than good  It does more damage than good 
[02:53:30]  When you fight these petty fucking issues  It damages the people you're trying to help and protect  Yeah  It doesn't help them  It absolutely doesn't  Yes  Slow clap  Absolutely  Look the bottom line is  In ten years from now  Whatever word they're using for gay  Whatever's acceptable  And my friend goes  I just went to a Broadway show  And I saw a dance  And I kind of liked it  I'm using that word  I'm using that word  I don't give a fuck  Whatever you want to change it to  I'm using that  Right right  It doesn't matter  We're going to be able to keep up  Yeah exactly 
[02:54:00]  Queer  Homo  Can't use any of them  Fag  Okay whatever you can  Whatever you're going to have in ten years  I'm using that  I'm a big fan of the old school queer  You know what  I like that word  I've been using it a lot on stage now  It's kind of like honky but  You're a little light in the loafers  Light in the loafers  It sounds fun  It does  It sounds fun  A little floaty  Floaty  Floaty  So  And like  Fruity's a great example  Fruit used to mean gay  Hey you fruit  You'd say he's a fucking fruit  That meant he was gay  Now you can say fruity  And people go  Oh that means that he's a little goofy 
[02:54:30]  Or a little off  Or a little crazy  Nobody cares  That is not a gay slur anymore  Yeah  Archie Bunky used to use fruit all the time  I think he's a fruit  He would say  He used to use fairy didn't he  Oh fairy  Yeah  Oh jeez dear  Yeah  Oh jeez dear  Why did you suck a cocktail  Everyone knows England is a fag country  When he said that  It's like fucking brilliant  England is a fag country  You understood what he meant  It's great  What was Russell saying  No my friends and I use dancer as code for gay 
[02:55:00]  Oh dancer  Because if we said  Yo that guy's gay  They'd be like  Oh he's not cool  No see  Yeah  Cause gay means not cool  No no he's a fucking dancer  Oh he's gay  Gotcha  Oh  That makes more sense  You know what I mean  It actually does make more sense  He's a dancer  Oh okay  You referenced it  So we gotta play some Archie  We love playing Archie Bunky  Oh yeah  On this show  What do you got A  Just because a guy is sensitive  And he's an intellectual  And he wears glasses  You make him out of queer  I never said a guy who wears glasses is a queer 
[02:55:30]  A guy who wears glasses is a four eyes  A guy who's a fag is a queer  That's fucking funny  That was on fucking television  That's it  I know  Jesus Christ  I was on television  Not only was it on television  It was when we only had three fucking channels  Could you imagine trying to get that past anyone today on television  You couldn't  You absolutely couldn't  A guy that's a fag is a queer  You want one more?  It's brilliant  Yeah  Oh fuck yeah  You all know Roger  And we all know he's straight  And even if he wasn't  And I said if 
[02:56:00]  What difference would that make?  Do you know that in many countries  England for instance  There is a law that says  Whatever two consenting adults do in private  Is their own business  Listen  This ain't England  We threw England out of here a long time ago  We don't want no more part of England  And for your information  England is a fag country  Jesus Christ  Say  Are they still picking handkerchiefs out of their sleeve, huh?  Are they still standing around  Leading on them skinny umbrellas like this here? 
[02:56:30]  I know  Their whole society is based on a kind of a fagdom  You know you're right, Archie  You're right  The British are a bunch of pansies  Pansies, fairies, and sissies  And the Japanese are a race of midgets  The Irish are boozers  The Mexicans are bandits  And you Polacks are media  Shit  Kind of a fagdom  That was on  What child was that? 
[02:57:00]  CBS  Was it CBS?  CBS  Fucking CBS  We used to watch that in front of the whole family  The whole family would watch it  And laugh their asses off  And they would play stuff like that with the shitty sitcoms  That we have to fucking  Was it brilliant?  The new ones?  Oh yeah  Christ  Just great  Golden era of TV  That was just  And to think  You couldn't put that shit on fucking FX now  You couldn't put it on  You could barely put it on HBO  Exactly  It would have to be like somebody who's really evil  And you'd have to show them as being evil 
[02:57:30]  And they have to die at the end  In a horrible way  That guy was the fucking  He was the lovable guy on the show  You rooted for them every show  Of course  FX is pushing some envelopes  It's Always Sunny this year  Went to a few places where I was like  Always Sunny  Holy shit  Yeah I like Always Sunny  They're doing some things  But they're on FX  The looting thing  Did you see the looting thing?  I'm a little behind  No  I'm behind  They were showing  They were watching clips  Danny DeVito's trying to explain  That the media just spins everything  And they're watching clips 
[02:58:00]  Of the LA riots  With Rodney King  And then of the  Of what happened in  With the hurricane  In Katrina  Yeah  And he goes  It's showing all the white people  In New Orleans  And he goes  Now would you see  These people are surviving  Or looting  And she goes  They're surviving  They're like getting  What they need  And then he plays  Rodney Kingcliffe  And it's all these black people  Running out of the story  And he goes  What are they doing?  She goes  They're looting  And he goes  Yeah see  That's how the media spins it  When it's white people  It's survival  When it's black people 
[02:58:30]  It's looting  And she goes  No  The black people are looting  Because they're carrying  Television sets  And he goes  How do you know  Those television sets  Don't have napkins  Branded toilet paper  Inside of them  But I was just like  Jesus Christ man  That was a ballsy  Fucking joke to do  That's kind of bold  Yeah  Especially in this  Fucking dumb day and age  Eric has one more  He says  Oh okay  Why not  Not only that  I had Michael eat him too  Mike  It ain't enough 
[02:59:00]  That he's a pinko  And an atheist  You're gonna turn him  From a man  Into a morphodite  What's a morphodite?  A freak  With a little too much  Of each  And not enough  And neither  Shit's great man  How sad  Do you remember that episode  When Archie saved that woman  Who was choking or something  And gave her mouth to mouth  Oh it turned out to be a guy 
[02:59:30]  Yeah yeah  Fucking guy  See Joe  See  Remember that one  Right  Yeah  How fucking  You get right in there  Sad were all you guys  Because it kills me every time  You watch that show  And you love it so much  And then you watch an interview  With Carol O'Connor  Oh my god  And he's just like  Well when we did the character  And you're like  Yeah  No  Oh he was the complete opposite  In real life  Do Archie  Do the voice  He was a liberal guy  Leading heart liberal  Big time liberal  He dubbed it a black kid didn't he  Yeah yeah  Or was that just the TV show  I think it was the TV show 
[03:00:00]  Did you ever see the series finale?  No by that point  Yeah because it went to Archie  Bunker's Place  Or something like that  It went to shit  He turned into like  He wasn't even Archie anymore  Yeah  The series finale make you cry  No it won't  Guarantee it'll make you cry  No it won't  It will  Why not one in mind  He said he wasn't going to use  The F word anymore  Yeah  Are you teasing something  Joe's teasing something  That happened 30 years ago  Tell us what happened  I know  It's not like it's on next  It's not like the Axl Rose interview  Archie's 
[03:00:30]  I want to tell you tomorrow  On VH1 with Jim Florentine  Archie's play stunk  But that was the spinoff  They kept going after  But the regular  You made that annoying chick on it  Yeah the regular show that ended  When All in the Family ended  The last episode is he's throwing  Some big Irish feast or something  At his bar  And he's making Edith  Cook all this shit  But she's got a blood clot  In her leg  And the doctor's like  You need to stay off your feet  Because that can travel to your brain  You could die  Right  But she doesn't tell Archie  Because she's scared to tell him  And he's running her all over the place  Making her cook and shit 
[03:01:00]  These awful special episodes  No no no  It was funny  The whole time it was funny  They made it comedic  A load of laughs  They made it comedic  I'm like a funny blood clot  Yeah  I don't mean that  In the Jamaican sense  I mean  But you guys  Forget it  This is good to Bob  This is good to Bob  I know where this is going  No we're listening Joe  When did they start the  Don't Stop Believing music  Dude  End of the episode  She finally tells him  And he gets mad at her  For not telling him  Yeah  Punches her in the face  And they're laying in bed 
[03:01:30]  And he finally drops  The whole facade  And he goes  I've been running my mouth  For a long time  But I ain't nothing without you  And he tells her  He loves her for the first time  And it's the end  And you just see the human in him  For one second  And you're like  There it is  But I don't want to  That's what the whole show was about  Was how he  Is a loud mouth  But he depends on her  And he really does  He is a little scared  Yeah but we could figure it out  Without it spoon fed to us  We knew he needed to eat it  How about we go out  With a big laugh  I thought she was going to die  At the end  I'm like 
[03:02:00]  Alright that's a better ending  I thought she was blue in the bed  Getting me all crying over here  Yeah  Through your tears  Right  I'm absolutely crying over here  I didn't know I was in here  With a bunch of barbarians  Yes  Well  Mr. Sensitive Cocksucker  Yeah  We just pounded you  For an hour and a half  For your decision making  What do you think  Hey whatever your update  That's cool  It didn't go that way  I think Joe's intro should be  Ladies and gentlemen  Your next comic is a funny cocksucker  Now we rock found

[03:05:00]  I get so mad at people  Sometimes you'll talk to somebody  And they'll go  You know what's your favorite show  You're all on the family  And they'll go  It's just so racist  And I go  You don't understand the show  Yeah  The beauty of that show  Was they had the guy  That was completely left  And the guy that was  Completely right  And the two guys  Pointed out the flaws  In the other guy's character  Perfectly balanced  Fucking characters  Perfectly balanced  Fuck yeah  It's like  It's like when people  Watch the Honeymooners  And go  I don't like it  Because he says  He's gonna hit his wife 
[03:05:30]  And it's like  Favorite part  Do you keep watching  When she tells him  To shut his fat mouth  Yeah there's an elephant  In the room  Yeah  You never hit her  That and the mother-in-law too  I love when he cocks  His fist back  And goes  You dirty  He's just gonna  Fucking pop her  In the face  When he swallows it  When she goes  Yeah the biggest thing  Around here  Are your pants  And he just goes  Like when the mother-in-law  Just turns to him  And goes  Oh why don't you  Shut up  People are just  Talking to each other  Like shit 
[03:06:00]  Back then  Every sitcom should be like that  29 minutes of insults  And then they make up  At the end  The last minute  I love you  I love you too  And that's it  Hey we'll see you next week  What was the final episode  Of the Honeymooners  How did they go out  The original episode  Alice had a blood clot  Yeah  She finally got punched in the face  I think out of the original  I really do love you  In the beginning of the show  Instead of the end  Yeah  I think out of the original episodes  It was the one where he was  The super of the building  But there was no finale  No fucking 
[03:06:30]  But back then  They didn't go for the big finales  Right  The show just kind of ended  Well it wasn't really  He did the show  But he did it on the  It was a sketch that he did  On the Jackie Gleason show  Yeah  And then they said  We want to do a sitcom  And he goes  Look I'm doing 30  And that's it  One and fucking done  That's all he wanted to do  That's why it's called  Like when you  I have the box  It's called like the  Classic 30  Yeah  Or whatever the fuck  And that was it  And then they kept bringing it back  It got really bad  Did you ever see the one  In the 70s  Where it's like a musical  It's terrible  Who's the wife in it  It's like  What's her name 
[03:07:00]  McCray  Or  It's  I don't know  But it's hilarious  Gwen McCray  Might as well be  Gleason and Art Carney  Kept getting grayer  And fatter  Yeah  And older  And they just kept replacing  The get out of here  You old bag  And bring in some  New 25 year old chick  Sheila McCray  Was his wife  No fucking clue on this  They just got any  Hollywood redhead  To sit in  Yeah  Yeah  It was in color too  Awful  Yeah  It was in color  They should have kept it  In black and white 
[03:07:30]  But they sing songs  Ope  Yeah  Why would you agree to that  It was bad  His gambling  Must have been bad  He was drunk  Yeah  He needed the money  He wanted to fuck  Sheila McCray  I needed the money  He was quite the womanizer  He gave a fuck  Yeah his face was on the wall  Of every diner in Miami  He was like  Ah fuck it  You want to do another TV show  Why not  Alright  Get it started  The great one  I don't care if you burn  Great show though 
[03:08:00]  I love the love boat  Ah yeah  The love boat  When you look at  Shows like the Honeywinners  It's like  That was in the 50s  And it's still  The same fucking premise  In 90% of the sitcoms  They got the  You know  The funny couple  A schlubby husband  With a hot wife  Yeah  With a wife  That's too hot for him  The wacky neighbors  The fucking set  Is the apartment  And you know  Shit like that  People coming in  And out of the door  All the time  Yeah  It just  It didn't change from that  I love Lucy  Same fucking thing  Dude you watch  You watch King of Queens  And you can see that

And I was like  Yeah  What the fuck  I like Playboy like  When I was seven  Yeah  It's like  Okay  At least it's something  Wow  I remember my friend's father  Would watch porn  Like he was watching  The fucking news  We'd go to his house  Really?  His dad would just be  Sitting there watching porn  And he wouldn't shut it up  We'd all be  Hanging out  And his dad would just be  Watching it  How old were you?  I was fucking 13  We're talking like 
[03:29:00]  83  82  83  You could do that  In those days  There wasn't a fucking lawsuit  And he would be smoking  And watching it  And I'm like  Should I jerk off?  I called my dad  Was your friend's name  A Sandusky?  I called my dad  Completely passed out  On the couch  With a hardcore  Fucking porn on  And I was like 17  So I had to tell him  When I was home  He was waiting out for me  It was a curfew  Type of situation  And it was so fucking awkward  I had to wake him up  As the moaning  Was coming from the TV  Jesus Christ  He was like  Oh how did this get on the TV? 
[03:29:30]  I got  My dad  Did he have a rod?  He had a rod  But then in a weird way  I was like  A little more proud of my dad  Yeah exactly  Alright my dad's cool  Yeah  We never talked about it  After that  I probably could have  Done the cool thing  And changed the channel  Before I woke him up  You know  But  Chose not to  You think?  My dad started  Critiquing my porn  I'm not making it  Because I would like  I would forget  I would leave it  In the VCR or something  And then my mom 
[03:30:00]  Thought she was taping  The Young and the Rassist  And she'd go to put it on  And she'd be like  Oh  And then my dad  Pulled me aside  And we'd go  Because I liked  Older broads  And from a young age  I always liked older broads  So I'd get like  You know like  Over 40  Mature  Whatever the fuck  My dad put me aside  Why don't you get something  With nice young girls  In it  Who wants to see all these  Bloody old  Wrinkled women  And I'm like  Yeah  No it's just what I could get  Shit  That's great  Get something more entertaining

[03:31:30]  Oh that's a  That's a bold move  Right there  You're a champion  Dude I was out of my  I was so drunk  And he shook me  And I woke up  And I was still  Holding my dick  And I go  Like that  And he just goes  I think you should go to bed  And I did  He never  Ever spoke to me about it  Did you wake up and think  I hope that was a dream  Or something  I hope that didn't happen  He woke  Oh fuck I think it happened  He woke me up the next morning  And my dad never did that  He always let me sleep in 
[03:32:00]  He didn't give a shit  And the next  It was a Saturday  And he woke me up  And he goes  Hey buddy  I made some pancakes  And that was his way  Of being like  Look it's cool  Everything's cool  You know  He didn't want  He didn't want  You to have to approach him  Yeah like  If he fucking Freudian slips  Hey buddy  I made you some Hancock's  Or if he woke you up  By shaking your dick  Yeah I know  I just need some extra batter  Oh jeez  Yeah jeez 
[03:32:30]  Over there  Yep it's that time  Isn't it  I guess so  Wow that went fast  Someone was telling me  That Russell Peters  Just broke Chris Rock's record  I don't know  Your people want us to mention it  Did they  My people want you to mention it  Your people  I guess I did  That's kind of cool though  Eric what happened  You say it  What do you rock  The arena that they mentioned  O2  The O2 arena  February in England  2010  February 2010  He broke Chris Rock's record  29,000 people  Jesus  That's where you film your special right

[03:39:30]  I don't know  You gotta pick one  The comedians  Can get out of here  Did I say anything bad  To Rob Cross today?  I forgot  Yeah  What'd I say?  You said  In the beginning of the show  I said that  Matt the intern  Shouldn't be talking to you  Before the show starts  And you said  To be fair  Rob Cross and Gary  Haven't figured that out  Yet either  And then  Then you went  So far as to say  Rob Cross is the king  Of small talk  And just doesn't  Understand that  Just because I talk 
[03:40:00]  About something on the air  The day before  Doesn't mean  That I want to have  A private conversation  With you now  I forget some of the stuff  I say on the air  And then like reality hits  Right  Because we  I mean because you did  The whole show  And it's like  That seems like  A week ago  And how many times  Can I say  I'm just doing that  For the show  Before people don't  Believe me anymore  You don't want people  To understand about  The radio  Is that like  The stuff you say  On the air  Generally  That's the truth  More often than not  I completely mean it  Right  But then off air 
[03:40:30]  I have to go  It's for the show  You know  We gotta entertain  These people  It was just for the show  It was an exaggeration  I don't really think that way  The fakeness is  Once you get off the air  And you have to be nice to people  Ah Christ  Where is he  He's literally  Like first he was in the corner  And now he's right  On the other side of that door  I saw him  Walk to the other side of the door  You can have him  Talk to you on the air  His eyesight isn't that good right  I will  I refuse to comment  Alright we're gonna try some  Okay  I'm gonna open the door  You  Say you have to talk to him  Okay  And watch it right there  Okay  Alright you open the door  Okay there's 
[03:41:00]  Rob come here for a second  I just wanted to talk to you  He caught you  Do you want Tom Papa's  Super David episode  He's sneaking out  We already said yeah  He's sneaking out  But I  He's still walking  Do you want it regularly  Or do you want just that episode  One and done  We'll see how  How it feels on the air  Alright  Smoothly  Smoothly executed  I  Did you notice  What was going on there 
[03:41:30]  Rob Cross  Oh yeah  He was hiding  I hope he decided to hide behind the door  And he was hoping that I'd call you in  You'd walk in  And he'd be able to sneak out the other side  And he would have gotten away with it too  Were everyone else staring at him outside  Is that what happened  Everybody was staring at him through the glass  Like okay  He's behind the door then  Yeah  What was he doing behind the door  It was amazing  It's amazing  Look at the hallway right now  It's packed  Yeah  We have like  Famous comedians  Just hanging out and talking  This is where we work  Rob Cross  I know  How do you deal with  With the things that are said about you on the air 
[03:42:00]  And then you have to go and talk to these people  Like human beings  I just can't understand it  How do I do that  You take it much worse than any of us do  I know  But I don't have to like  Your mom is on the phone  Getting  Yeah she is  Yeah  But I don't have to  That's a lot tougher than  Yeah but you have to be like  Hey we're trying to run something here  Let's talk respectfully  And you know  Not really  No  You don't even try  Just like look  Tell me the answer to the question 
[03:42:30]  It is what it is  Yeah  This is  This is what I'm here for  Will this deter you  Did you hear the beginning of the show today?  Yes I did  So you heard when  He made reference to you  Making small talk with him  Yeah well I mean it's tough  You know like  It's amazing  Do you say hi or  You don't  You're sitting there going  Okay here's my strategy  I'm just going to be a human being  Well no that would be overthinking  I wish I had put that much thought into it  But I think it's like the Pop-Tarts thing  You know maybe like  They just don't want the Pop-Tarts 
[03:43:00]  They don't want the Pop-Tarts  I miss the Pop-Tarts  You're like okay  I kind of do too  But  So when you first started coming in  This is when you come in early  You brought in  You'd bring in Pop-Tarts  I brought some lovely Pop-Tarts  Usually two or three boxes in a selection  Yeah  But it's like nobody wants them  You'd put them out on the table  Pop-Tarts for everybody  You'd say good morning to everybody  Right  First thing you get hit with is  Why the fuck is he bringing in these Pop-Tarts  What an idiot  And then you go okay  No Pop-Tarts  Now it's the  You talking to people 
[03:43:30]  Yeah  So  Well  I guess it's just going to  What's  What's after that?  What's the strategy going forward?  Because you'll still have to come in early  So is it going to be that  You just  I don't know  Don't come into the studio  I mean I hope he does shit right?  Yeah  Maybe I could shit next door  Yeah  Well you shouldn't  Me too  I also wanted to talk to you  Because I was on Ron and Fez yesterday  Oh yeah  And I hear that you've been walking around  And using the word cross  In a very supervillain-esque way 
[03:44:00]  That's my thing  Like don't cross me  Oh yeah yeah  We'll cross that bridge when we get to it  Yeah  Don't put me on a cross  Yeah  Is this working so far?  Seems to be yeah  Yeah  Because I mean it's caught on  On the air  Yeah  Who's that?  I don't know  Let's find out  I think it's my dentist  Your dentist  By the way  The boss is in here  So I should mention  That this after show  After Open Anthony Live 
[03:44:30]  Is brought to you by  Trojan Bearskin Condoms  Trojan America's number one  Most trusted condom brand  And the other thing  Rob Cross  That you should be aware of  And now that you're in the studio  You can plainly see  This is what happens to me  And this is where I'm stuck  I'm here  Trying to host  After Open Anthony Live  There was just  A hugely  High energy show  Going on in here  Because you had the likes  Of Opie and Anthony  Then you combine that  With Joe DeRosa  With Russell Peters  With Jim Florentine  Just boom 
[03:45:00]  Boom  Boom  Hit after hit  After hit  And then all of a sudden  Within one commercial break  All of the energy  Gets completely  Sucked out of the room  Like a vacuum  Yeah  Like there's just  All this fun  Positive energy  I gotta tune in  And hear this  All this  All that vibe  Okay  The vibe  Is snatched  Out of the room  I almost said robbed  From the room  But that's your line  That's you  That's usually when I show up  When all the fun  Has been snatched  From the room  It's snatched 
[03:45:30]  Out of the room  And then I'm left  To pick up the pieces  Yeah  The keg is empty  The hot chicks  Have gone home  And now  Listen  I don't want to talk  Rob  About Matt the intern  And you're  Good  Cause I actually  Have other things to do  So I'm just gonna  Leave you here to wallow  In your own  Vibe-less  He walks in here  And he's smirking  But he's got his head down  Don't you dare  Talk on a microphone  Thinking that I won't  Notice  That he's got  A not Sam sticker  On his chest  Like he's like  Oh wait till Sam  Sees this 
[03:46:00]  He just can't  Sal  You understand  What your fellow  Intern is doing  Yeah  He's just setting himself up  See you later Rob Cross  He's just  He needs the attention  And I  It's like I don't  You don't want to  Give it to him  I mean  You don't have to  Give him anything  I shouldn't  I really shouldn't  Don't even breathe  On that mic  I don't want to hear  That you exist  The radio audience  Doesn't need to even hear  That you exist  Matt the intern  No breathing  He wants to talk  He's not going to  I will dump out of him

[03:47:30]  I saw some of your  Instagram page  Bill Clinton  Bill Clinton  You sure it wasn't  George Clinton  No  Roger Clinton  Bill Clinton  Where was Bill Clinton  At the Beacon  Brian Williams  John Stewart  Celebrities love  Bruce Springsteen  It was Edward Norton  Richard Gere  It was like an A-list  Backstage  Was Richard Gere  Walking like  Kind of funny  Like he might have  Had a gerbil  No  I heard rumor  I don't know  He walked around like  He had money  He was a rich man  So you were backstage  At the Beacon  To see Bruce 
[03:48:00]  Yeah  How did you score that  I know people  You do know people  And I'll be backstage  At all the other  Festivities  What festivities  The comedy festival  Bruce was doing comedy  Yes  He does two minutes  Every year  Bruce does two minutes  Of comedy  Yeah  Is he good  He crushes every year  Well that's also  A room full of Bruce fans  And he's only doing  Two minutes  Well no the thing is  He'll do two  Like long stories  Like a  But they're really  Dirty jokes  He does  He does dirty jokes  Really dirty jokes  Yeah  Wow  How many 
[03:48:30]  Have you  I know  Did you get a picture  Yesterday  No no  You get a picture  Your ass is out  It's amazing  Amazing to me  How many times  Have you  Sort of  Six times  You've met him  Six times  At the comedy festival  Yeah  How many times  Have you seen him  In concert  250  Is that official  Or is that an estimate  It's around there  Around there  Do you actually count  Or do you just keep  An estimate  I keep an estimate  Okay so it's about  250 times  You've seen him in concert  You've met him  Six different times  And then he was up here  That's not counting  The time he was up here 
[03:49:00]  Right  No  And you saw him  Close  You didn't meet him  No I didn't meet him here  Of all the time  I mean  Norton's got a picture  With Springsteen  Yeah if  Last night  If he got a picture  With Clinton and Springsteen  They had his ass  Opened out the door  Even Norton  Yeah they were  Keeping the tabs  On everybody  With the iPhones  Because people  Had the  Trying to record  Conversations  Because it was  Clinton  John Stewart  Brian Williams  Joking around  With Gervais  Yeah were they  Checking your Instagram  No because somebody  Well no  That was  Because I had  The old phone 
[03:49:30]  But you hear  Siri going  Recording or something  You hear like  Her voice  Sure  And that security  Just grabbed that phone  Right at the guy  And that's it for them  Oh he was at the door  And the comedy festival  Doesn't like that either  Well it was  Secret Service  I was like  That was his people  That was Secret Service people  Yeah  Between him  Bruce and the other people  They're like  Clinton  Clinton  It's like 1520 backstage  Not George Clinton  No  Bill Clinton  Bill Clinton  That's amazing  How does he look  Good  Check everybody's hands  Say how are you 
[03:50:00]  He shook your hand  Yeah  You shook hands  With Bill Clinton  Yeah  Do he smell good  He smells great  And when Ricky comes in  In January  He'll confirm everything  Ricky's coming  Ricky Gervais  Is coming back here  Yes  January  Hotline  Hello  You are on  After Open Anthony Live  Damn  You didn't pick up  On something  What did I miss  Norton would have  Easily been  Shown the door  To get a picture  With Clint  Yeah  You're right  Norton would have  If Clinton  If they were like 
[03:50:30]  Listen Norton  I know you're a comedian  But if you get a picture  With Bill  We're going to show you  The door  Okay  Fine  I'll get the picture  And then I'll leave  He would have taken  That hit no problem  With that  And the other thing  Roland  Was Jim Gaffigan there  Yeah  Yeah he tweeted  A picture of him  And Clinton last night  Yeah  He got it through  Yeah  How did Gaffigan  Get the picture then  If you're performing  You got a picture  Oh Gaffigan performed  Yeah  So what was the  What was the show  Bob Woodruff Foundation  And it was comedians 
[03:51:00]  And Bruce  And they had  An army of people  That were there too  The secretary of  Something was there  Opie do you still  What gives you  Because you have  A picture with Clinton  I sure do Sam  What gives you more pride  The fact that you have  That picture  Or the fact that  It drives Jim crazy  To the point that  He has nightmares about it  That it drives Jimmy nuts  My Clinton picture  Is not even on display  Anywhere  Oh no  I put it on my website  Finally  It'll be radio.com  That's right  Boom  About  I'll just bring you  Bring his  He has  Clinton  Bruce 
[03:51:30]  Jon Stewart  Everybody in one shot  But what makes it  My favorite part  Of what I'm hearing  On the after show  Is the fact  That Roland  Still doesn't have  A picture with Bruce  For instance  And it amazes me  That you've seen him  Six times  And you still don't  Have a picture with him  Meaning you met him  Six times  Yeah  Someone put out a camera  And all eyes  Are back on me  I'm like  Never mind  Eric who's the guy  On Roland's t-shirt today  That would be Bruce Springsteen 
[03:52:00]  Every day  He's got a Springsteen shirt  How could you not  At some point  Have just  The fates just have  Never aligned  For you to get a picture  With him  You've met him six times  No  And Sam  I've been managing  My hate for the company  Lately  If you notice  I've been doing  A pretty good job  With it  You have  I will compliment you  On that  But as soon as  Roland said  I still don't have  A picture with Springsteen  It brought me back  To the day  Where the company  Did not do the right thing  And get Roland's picture  With Springsteen  That one drives me nuts  That could be 
[03:52:30]  One of my top five things  That drives me nuts  About series like that  That Roland didn't get  A Springsteen picture  No that they didn't  Take care of Roland  Knowing how important  It would have been to him  For the rest of the people  That got pictures  With Springsteen  That day  It was a throwaway really  Most of those pictures  Probably aren't even  On display  They're on someone's camera  Somewhere  Or in a drawer  But fucking  It meant  It meant everything  To Roland  And the company  Did not do the right thing  That's why I love Gervais  Because he initiated  He goes  Bruce 
[03:53:00]  It's Roland's birthday  He loves you  He's here  And then Bruce goes  Shook my hand  Give me a half of a hug  He goes  Happy birthday  Bruce said happy birthday  To you  Because Ricky initiated  That's huge  And he did  I didn't work for Ricky  And he loves the guys  So he's come back January  That's why  Opie how long  Are you going to be  In a bad mood  Because of you  Getting reminded  Of what the company  Did to Roland  I'm not going to  I'm not going to  Make believe  By the time I  See my son  I'll be good  But okay  So you're looking at  What ten minutes  Five  For the rest of the ride home 
[03:53:30]  I mean that one  Drives me  Fucking batshit crazy  The fact that  The company knew  Exactly how important  It was to Roland  And they just  Would not allow it  To happen  All he had to do  Was get on the  Back of the line  With the listeners  That day  That is  I think the company  If they're listening  To any of this  Horseshit that I  Spew on a regular basis  They owe Roland  And they absolutely  Should make sure  That Roland  Gets a picture  With Bruce Springsteen  And make good  On that one  Do you think  The company Roland  Would be able 
[03:54:00]  To facilitate  A private meeting  Between you and Bruce  Well I think he is  Coming back next year  Because he has a new  Album and everything  For David Marsh  Alright so let's  Start campaigning now  Make sure it happens  Next year  Let's do it  Or I'll see the hand again  Is that what you got  Was it  Okay so when you  When you went to  This Bruce event  That was here  Was it a maybe  Or was it a definitely  You're not going to  Get a picture  I made eye contact  With a person  And he did the  Wave like no  The person who works here 
[03:54:30]  You don't have to  Mention names  No then I turned around  And I saw Bruce  And then I put my head down  And cried my soul  To sleep  So Opie  Are you envisioning now  Roland getting the wave  The hand wave  Right to his face  It's unbelievable  I don't think  The average listener  Understands the  Connection  That Roland has  With Springsteen  We live it every  We live it  We live it  Every fucking day  Yeah  He always brings up  Bruce  Literally  I just took my hand  Out and touched him 
[03:55:00]  From here  And when he was here  Serious  And they go  No  And then Bruce  Just kind of  Looked at me  Because he was  Taking pictures  With everybody  And then when  I think I had  The wave off  I was like  Roland who's your  Number two  I don't even know  If you have a number two  Really  Not really though  It's like  Once I get Bruce  I'm happy  Isn't it like you too  I do love you too  With Bono  But Bono  I met once  And I'm happy  That I met him  But for Bruce  I would love a picture  Yeah cause  Roland is not  Like a fanboy  By nature  Like he's not a fan 
[03:55:30]  Of a lot of stuff  He spends most  Of his time  You know  Doing what he has  Putting up with  Bullshit for his job  So he's not like  You know  The way  E-Rock is  With whoever  The way I am  With wrestlers  Like he doesn't have  A ton of people  That he's fans with  It's Bruce  It's Bruce  It kind of starts  And stops  With Springsteen  That's why I said  I don't think he has  Number two  Bono's way up  On my list  And uh  I didn't realize  It's the 20th anniversary  Of Octung Baby  But Roland turned me off  To that documentary  The making of Octung Baby 
[03:56:00]  I loved it Roland  It's really good  I fucking loved it  And then  There's a whole bunch  Of covers  That are coming out  By a whole bunch  Of people  Including  I know Sam  You like Jack White  Love Jack White  He does  Which one does he do  Roland  Love is Blindness  I think  Yeah  I think he does  Love is Blindness  But somebody online  Turned me on  To it on Twitter  Saying you gotta hear  Nine Inch Nails  Nine Inch Nails  Did uh  Oh fuck  I don't have  I don't have the info  In front of me now  But anyway  I listened to that cover  And then it turned me on 
[03:56:30]  To a whole bunch  Of current artists  Doing songs  From Octung Baby  For music fans out there  I would search it out  And say it's awesome  Is it an album  Is it like the soundtrack  To the documentary  Or something  No  It's just a different album  It's like anniversary  When did it come out  I think it came out  Like either  Last week  Or early this week  Oh so it's new  Brandon yeah  Cool cool cool  Which song did uh  Oh I think uh  Nine Inch Nails  Did Mysterious Ways  I think that was it  Yeah I'm not sure  Yeah I'm not too sure  Do you have it  I don't have that one yet 
[03:57:00]  They changed it around  To uh  I liked it  But there were other  Songs on that  I liked better  Jack White's version  Is pretty damn cool  Yeah I want to hear that  I mean I'm not a giant  You know U2 fan  Or whatever  But I can listen to  Anything Jack White does  Yeah I uh  I love Octung Baby  I just forgot  It's been many many years  But that was the album  They came out with  After Rattlin' Home  Because the band  Felt like they were  In trouble  That they were going  To lose their core audience  And they had to  Come up with something  It's just amazing  That U2 
[03:57:30]  Was ever in a position  Where they felt like  They were in trouble  Yeah and one  One was a good  About them breaking up  And that about  Like Saving Africa too  Which is funny  I was shocked by that  Because in the documentary  They discussed all that  I was a huge fan  Of Rattlin' Home  But I guess it fell flat  And people really hated  The movie  Hated the concept  I didn't realize that  Because I really  Really enjoyed it  But the band  You know showed  That they didn't have  Uh  They didn't have much  Personality  You know when the 
[03:58:00]  Cameras were rolling  You know Bono  Is pretty animated  But the rest of the band  They're pretty chill  And pretty shy  Yeah I love  The scene where  They're all in the truck  Just staring at each other  And not saying one word  And they're like  Come on  Oh I know  The cameras were rolling  And yet they were in a van  Going to a gig or something  And the guy had to basically say  Look we're trying to make  A documentary here  So you guys gotta  You gotta talk  Do something  And they were just  Beyond stiff  It's a good documentary  I'm a huge fan  Of music documentaries  In general  But  Yeah  With The Edge  The Edge was good in that 
[03:58:30]  Uh  What's the guitar documentary  Play  Um it's the same director  It might get loud  Yeah same director  Davis Guggenheim  Oh really  That was great  That documentary  Yeah  Well I  I love the honesty  The honesty of Edge  Basically  Where you look at him  Like god  He comes up with  These amazing sounds  And he casually goes  Well actually  You know  All it is is this  And he's playing  Like a real basic riff  And then he's like  And then I turn on  A couple machines here  And this is how it sounds  That was awesome  Just seeing him do the riffs  And you didn't even  Recognize him  Until  Recognize them  Until he starts  Stepping on the pedals 
[03:59:00]  For all the effects  Yeah Jack White was great  In that movie too  That was my favorite scene  Was when he just made  The guitar  Out of  Whatever  It was like  Out of a nail  And a board  A Coke bottle  Yeah a Coke bottle  That's what it was  Hey uh  Officially I'm not mad  At the Springsteen picture  I'm home  Yeah  Thank god  Well thank you for calling in  See you guys tomorrow  Okay  Alright  Alright bye  Yes  I'm glad  I'm sorry  That Opie's ride home  Was unpleasant  Because of the  Situation 
[03:59:30]  That was a long time ago  Though wasn't it  Yeah  Almost  It was a year ago  Yeah  Almost  Um  But yeah  It is  Still crying  It really is  Unbelievable  That you  What about  Like we talked about  Opie  I would pass on  Like Bill Clinton  To left of me  Oh hang on  Hang on  Yes  After Opie and Anthony live  Why did you hang up on me  I was done talking to Opie  I didn't know you were  Going to pick up  You didn't play his  Facebook  Yeah  It was my turn 
[04:00:00]  To talk to him  You notice how quiet  I was when he was talking  Well I didn't even hear  You weren't on the phone at all  I didn't know  That was part of it  I know  I was letting him  Talk music  This is Club Soda Kenny  Of course  On After Opie and Anthony live  Kenny  Do you  You go to Stephen Singer  Don't you  Hey uh  Sam  You remember my line  Yesterday  That everybody  Like some people  Think bombed  Well I mean  What  You mean like  The question I just asked  That you didn't acknowledge
