<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a promotion for the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, followed by a call from race car driver Joe McCarthy, sponsored by Trim Spa, which quickly devolved into vulgar sexual humor.  Anthony then performed a Maury Povich impersonation with a caller described as a "special kid," continuing the show's crude comedic style.  A discussion about bad coffee transitioned into a darkly humorous conversation about a news story involving a man who murdered and dismembered his lover.

A substantial portion of the show focused on "Stalker Patty," a woman who relentlessly pursued the hosts.  The hosts and callers mocked and ridiculed Patty's actions, including her sleeping at their workplace, using derogatory and offensive language.  Listeners called in, often criticizing the hosts' treatment of Patty, which the hosts dismissed and defended, claiming their show lacked morality and a conscience and that their audience accepted this approach.  The segment continued with other callers sharing their bizarre behaviors, further fueling the crude humor. The show ended with promotional announcements interspersed with more discussion of Stalker Patty and other listeners' unusual behaviors, and plans for future segments featuring them.

The next segment centered on evaluating recurring non-staff participants, referred to as "mental patients."  Lady Di was given an ultimatum to present a segment idea within a week to avoid being voted off the show. Limo Ant was also deemed "on the bubble."  A phone message from Marion, Lady Di's friend, criticized Lady Di's jealousy. The hosts discussed other recurring participants, including past interactions with Wheelchair Fred, recounting a chaotic live show incident where Anthony's failed "faith healer" bit on Wheelchair Fred resulted in thrown objects and an angry audience.  The death of Dee Dee Ramone was briefly mentioned.  A heated argument erupted between the hosts and Limo Ant regarding Limo Ant's perceived lack of contribution and accusations of charging for services, culminating in Limo Ant’s angry departure.  The segment concluded with further discussion of problematic participants and a call from a listener supporting Opie.

A subsequent segment featured a heated argument between Anthony and a producer named Harvey over money owed and past grievances, filled with insults, profanity, and bizarre gambling analogies.  The conflict included accusations, denials, and a declared "truce." Callers John and Maria expressed anger and criticism, respectively.  Studio guests Paul Mercurio, Rich Voss, and Patrice O’Neill were present.  A significant portion involved playing and harshly critiquing an old comedy tape of Rich Voss, with the hosts and guests making crude comments about his appearance and performance. Numerous commercials were interspersed throughout.

Further segments included continued criticism of Rich Voss's old stand-up routine by Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and guest Paul Mercurio, who promoted his shows at Bananas Comedy Club.  Numerous commercials aired, advertising various products and services. The conversation touched on Patrice O'Neal (via phone), personal anecdotes, and audience phone calls.  The vulgar and irreverent tone persisted.

The final segment featured Paul Mercurio as a guest, telling jokes that the hosts repeatedly interrupted and mocked.  The running gag involved Mercurio's one-liners. The conversation covered various unrelated topics, including Mercurio's past experiences, hospital visits, gambling, and the hosts’ lottery experiences. The hosts continued to make crude and sexually suggestive remarks, and other callers shared humorous observations.  The show ended with numerous commercial breaks.

Don't know who you are, Joe. 
[00:01:00]  Hey, Cabby, it's Joe McCarthy. I drive the 41 Busch car for the Busch North Series and the Trim Spa Racing Team.  This guy's a race car driver, and you're taking Trim Spa, right, Joe?  Yeah, I've been taking Trim Spa for a month now, and I needed something to get me in shape for the upcoming season, and I've got to tell you, it makes me feel awesome.  And it's just all around improving our race team.  It's a high-speed diet pill for a high-speed, fast car driver.  I tell you what, if we can get around the racetrack as quick as we burn fat, we'll have a real good season. 
[00:01:30]  Man, I'll tell you what, now you had a race this past weekend, and you finished what, eighth?  Yeah, we finished eighth position out of 30 cars, and it's a great way to start the season off.  See, people, 1-800-TRIM-SPA, or go to the website, www.trimspa.com, and you can lose weight, just like Joe and the thousands of millions of trillions of other people who go to the website, www.trimspa.com, or they call them up.  Operators are standing by, Joe, 1-800-TRIM-SPA.  Hey, Joe, do you?  Shrimp spa? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah!  94WY's people at O.P.O.  O.P. and Anthony.  Talking about dirty spots, bite your tongue.  Delicious and tempting.  Pop and feel.  Yeah.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on 94WYSPA.  It has always been my dream to wipe out all of the world's diseases, but I believe that I will focus mainly on the one that is my cross. 
[00:02:30]  Vaginitis?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Anthony, we should have Maury talk to Jim like he's a special kid, because he is.  Could you give us just a little something, Maury? 
[00:03:00]  Do kids tease you at school?  Yes.  I mean, what do they say to you?  Hey, hey, pink nipples.  And what do you say about it?  Cut it out.  Well, have you ever, do you have any friends?  One.  That's one more than most people, son.  I can't think of it.  You're the best, man.  That's one more.  Let me add something to that.  Let me tell you something.  You have two now.  I'm your friend.  Very good, Anthony.  Maury's your friend. 
[00:03:30]  If I had a co-host, I would demand that of him.  I'll be your friend for another 40 minutes.  Maury's your friend.  Let's do it!  Hey, buddy, get out of my way.  You cannot act like a man!  What's the matter with you? 
[00:04:00]  Now you get the hell out of here!  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Don't you hate when coffee time goes bad?  Don't you hate it?  Coffee time went bad?  Coffee time went bad for me, O.P.  Coffee time, very important.  What happened?  Part of the program here.  When we're just getting ready to go on the air, 
[00:04:30]  we all get our little cups of coffee.  And you know how we always have a problem with the cream?  You never know what you're getting when you're...  Cream in the coffee, very good.  Makes it taste very rich and creamy.  But when you get it, you never know if it's going to be good or bad  until you pour it out in the coffee  and see what tumors of coagulated mess rise to the top. 
[00:05:00]  Curled milk again.  It was something.  There was a big lump in the cream and it floats to the surface  and then these beads of oil come shooting off of it across the surface of your coffee.  It's a science experiment.  So I just got all mad and threw it in the garbage pile and kicked it.  Awful.  I'm so happy because they got me the wrong coffee.  I wanted regular finally because the Brooklyn Diner iced coffee is horrendous.  I don't like their iced coffee.  I like their regular coffee.  That's why coffee time is so special.  Will you stop attacking the Brooklyn Diner?  I'm not attacking the Brooklyn Diner.  The food is good and the coffee is good, but I don't like their iced coffee. 
[00:05:30]  They end up yelling at me and then we have lunch for a month straight because of you.  Well, actually, that's not a bad thing.  The food is good.  I'm not complaining and saying it's a bad place.  I eat there.  What's wrong with their iced coffee?  I don't like it.  It's excellent.  Ben likes it.  Ben has it every day.  I know Ben does.  I'm not saying that Ben and his big, delicious unit don't enjoy the iced coffee there.  Jimmy, trust me.  We have enough enemies right now.  All right.  You know what?  The only restaurant is pissed off at us as well.  You're right.  You're right.  I apologize.  Boy, I wanted some phenomenal Brooklyn Diner iced coffee, but I figured I would go with 
[00:06:00]  the regular tonight because they're most so delicious.  I didn't know which one to thank you.  You know why coffee time is so special?  Because when it's good, it's so good that it is good.  Usually, there's some problem.  There's always some coffee-related dilemma.  It's special because we're together.  Right.  We don't need hate mail from restaurants now.  Go buy your own somewhere else, exclamation point.  I don't know.  My mail's been okay. 
[00:06:30]  Hopey.  Your mail has calmed down?  Yeah.  Actually, it never really picked up.  Well, you weaseled your way out of it.  I didn't weasel anything.  You were a part problem.  Well, you went to bail out.  Right at the last minute.  Well, a couple phone numbers in the New York City area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Someone has a quick question for Jimmy Norton. 
[00:07:00]  Ron, what's going on?  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, Ron?  Listen, I was wondering if I brought by the Daily News from today.  Could you autograph it for me?  You know what?  You're the second person to tell me I look like this guy.  What?  This guy who.  Some guy from England.  I think he has a better team.  He dismembered a guy and spread them all over England.  It was like putting a puzzle together.  They found a leg here, an arm here, a head there.  Yeah.  Dude, he said that one of the things he did here was when he went and saw Spider-Man.  Did he really?  Yeah.  And I'm asking Jimmy in the back office.  You think the guy is looking at the screen and sees Jimmy Norton on the screen and goes, 
[00:07:30]  wow, that guy kind of looks like me.  He probably thought that and then thought he wouldn't mind chopping me up.  He didn't call up a radio station and confess to killing a couple of people.  Before he chopped them up, did he?  Bastards.  The real guys never call.  All right, ONA.  All right.  Take care, man.  Yeah, a lot of people think that you look like the guy that's on the front page of the  papers today.  That's a sick story, huh, man?  He, what, he killed his gay lover there overseas and chopped him up a bit.  Chopped him up and then just cooked some of the body parts. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And then took off for New York City.  Hey, you got to travel.  You know, you got to unwind.  You need to do some sightseeing.  That is a sick, sick person that can do things like that.  And then he's sitting on a park bench in Central Park next to a homeless guy just reading the  Daily News, reading about himself.  Yeah.  And pretty much sitting there with the Daily News with his mug in the paper, probably right  on the front page yesterday as well, with people walking by going, wait a minute, you  look like, hey, you're the guy. 
[00:08:30]  And it was a piece of cake to catch him.  You're the chop up your gay lover guy.  So you had to eat him too.  To me, that's where it stops being sexy.  Really?  Anytime you see movies about stuff like that, or like I was saying, I was watching Silence  of the Lambs.  And you really get the impression of what that must be like when they're just with their  victim.  Just them and their victim.  Or even after they've done it.  When he's at that sewing machine, carefully sewing together the woman's skin. 
[00:09:00]  And he's just like, and he's all very into it.  And he's like, what the hell goes on in minds of people like that that can do something like  that?  Jeffrey Dahmer, where you're going out and you get your little Asian kid.  And yet, you know, as you're trying to hack him apart, he's running out in the street and  you've got to go get him now.  Like, what's going on in your head?  Now I've got to go chase him down.  Is it going through your head like, uh-oh, I'm going to get caught if he gets away? 
[00:09:30]  Or, hey, I haven't chopped you up yet.  You know?  It's just a twisted thing.  Insanity.  And do you think they have any real moments together?  Like, when you're, like, again, if you're just a quick kill, a lot of these guys are.  But, like, say you keep your victim for an hour or two hours.  Is there one real moment they have?  Like, do you understand what I mean?  Like, the guy will say something about, like, you know, ah, the game's on later.  And he goes, yeah, but they're favored by nine.  Yeah, yeah, a little.  Is there one real moment?  One moment of sanity, a sane conversation, just a piece of it.  Like you and I would have, as opposed to one man ready to brutally, you know, sexually assault and chop up another. 
[00:10:00]  We'll never know.  Hopefully.  At least I won't.  I'll know about some of the people in this goddamn room.  I will never know.  Yeah.  I could see that happening with you, Alvy, just losing your mind.  Doing what?  I don't know.  All of a sudden, you know, you find out there's something in your basement.  You're insane.  I don't know.  Because, you know, what do you think?  These people that were growing up before they snapped or thinking that they're going to do stuff like this. 
[00:10:30]  I think you just reach a point and there's like this little thing that just goes, that's it.  You're done.  I don't feel like playing the psycho role anymore.  No?  That's insane.  No?  No.  They'd catch you because they'd find one long, delicious, blonde lock at the scene.  Holding it up in the, glimmering in the sunlight in those tweezers that the cops use before they put it in that little bag.  Anthony, what's going on?  Opie, Anthony, Norton.  What's happening?  So, listen.  Opie, a little bit of advice for you.  Yeah.  When you're playing the role of scumbag, you've got to do it 100%. 
[00:11:00]  You can't just be like half-hearted, you know, get mad when people write you, you know, letters.  You've got to be the scumbag 150%.  Enjoy it.  Soak it up.  You're a scumbag.  I don't feel like being the scumbag all the time.  Well, you don't feel like being a psycho.  You don't feel like being a scumbag.  Wine, wine, wine.  You know, that's the problem with America today.  There's no work ethic.  No work value.  You've got to pick a role and stick with it.  Stick with it.  You're a scumbag.  Right.  Because you're half-Irish anyway, and Irish people make really good scumbags. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  That's how come they all become cops.  Thank you, Anthony.  Well, you're welcome.  I'm so glad we're moving on from what has happened on the show the last few days.  Right.  I put one thing out, too.  Like, a lot of people, you have to realize, a lot of people overreacted.  Like, you know, I'll be so terrible.  You know, it's interesting that Patty got so upset.  You know, and I felt bad that she was being Buddha, but she got so upset that 10 people might  see her wigless on 57th Street, but she was smiling ear to ear, being paraded in front  of 7,000 people at the softball game.  Hey, there you go, right?  And they weren't being nice.  No. 
[00:12:00]  So, I mean, come on.  That might have been a little overacting on that part, too.  They were yelling.  You know, Stinky wants to say something.  He's just about had it, because he's been dealing with phone calls for the last, like,  three days.  Oh, he's got to field all these.  How awesome he looks.  That's what it is.  He's so awesome.  Go ahead, Stink.  I'm sick of these people calling in and saying that Patty is the one that got the bad end  of this.  They don't go to work and have to avoid a crazy lady.  And then when they get to work, there's a crazy lady sitting right behind them, reading 
[00:12:30]  every little thing that you type on the screen.  And then when you go home from work, there's a crazy lady sitting outside, asking, talking  about, like, where she's going to move, stuff you don't care about.  Right.  And then she sleeps where you work.  No one would put up with this.  Anyone else would do what we did.  Are you saying you were part of what I did?  Indirectly?  I was cheering you along.  He was cheering it on.  Yeah.  People, I don't know.  Whatever. 
[00:13:00]  She is a stalker.  Yeah.  That's why we named her stalker Patty.  That's right.  And it got to the point where she was sleeping at our workplace.  That is, like, the pinnacle of a stalker of their career right there.  Could you imagine the other stalkers looking at Patty?  She should hold, like, symposiums.  Yeah.  She should just sit there and give speeches on how to be a stalker.  Because I could just see people, like, you know.  At the stalker convention.  Yeah.  Let's have a stalker convention. 
[00:13:30]  And from now on, Patty is to be referred to as stalker Patty.  No Patty, Patty, this Patty.  It's stalker Patty because she is a stalker.  That's all.  She should.  She should be the keynote speaker at the stalker conventions.  Patty.  Hi, Patty.  I have a claw hammer, and I've wanted to sink it into my favorite celebrity's head.  How do I do that? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, it's easy.  First, you just got to.  Well, you got to be persistent is what you got to do.  Don't ever give up.  And just be persistent.  And play the part of the victim.  You're the timing.  Feel so guilty that you have to.  They'll have to let you sleep where they work.  She's sleeping where the people she stalks works.  How do you pull that one off?  She's a genius. 
[00:14:30]  If she put this kind of motivation into working, we'd never see her.  Please.  Who the hell is cheering for this one?  She is doing exactly what she set out to do four years ago.  Stalk this program, especially Opie.  And she has reached the point where now she's just gone from a stalker to, I am reciting where they work.  Woo!  And we're partly responsible because we invite her in. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Of course.  And she's not a...  But now she's living...  Well, she was living and sleeping under our stairs.  She's got a college degree, doesn't she?  Supposedly a couple of college degrees.  She's not the complete helpless retard that people think, man.  No.  That's what the deal is.  People are hearing it and thinking,  Ah!  This poor, defenseless woman.  What are you doing?  She got the degrees.  She has the capacity to do something when motivated. 
[00:15:30]  She's living in the place of employment of the people she stalks.  Come on!  Give it up for her!  Give me a break!  And what we did, as harsh and awful as it was,  whatever, I'll take credit for it,  it didn't even affect her.  The first opportunity she had, 
[00:16:00]  she hung out with the ONA gang at the Bar 9  with her wig on.  And then our listeners,  the same listeners that have been cursing her  off and on for the last three years  are feeling so bad,  they decided to sing her happy birthday.  Patty, I have a question.  All right.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  I want to cut out Pam Anderson's uterus.  With a rusty knife.  I've been stalking her for about three years now.  How do I make the closing move? 
[00:16:30]  Well, get her audience to hate her  and love you.  And then you'll be able to do anything  because they'll be guilted into letting you near them  where you can then pull out the knife  and cut out a uterus.  Thank you, Larry.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys? 
[00:17:00]  Hey.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Yo, all I got to say is  soccer Patty's a friggin' nut job.  You guys should start going back  to the way you used to be  like four years ago  when you didn't give a nap about anything.  You know, you all are going around saying,  you know,  oh, what are the listeners saying?  You know, if they were true listeners  from back in the day like me,  they'd be loving this.  I agree with Mike.  I absolutely agree with Mike.  I have not given this an iota of thought.  I could give a flying F.  It's the whole point of cringe radio. 
[00:17:30]  During the whole thing,  it made me cringe so bad,  but I don't care.  I don't care what the people think.  I don't care what they want to say.  Well, nothing.  More people think that I went way too far.  Who cares?  Now I don't even know what they expect.  I don't know what they want.  I don't know.  I said it was harsh.  I said it was awful.  We didn't expect her to react like she did.  We did things, in my opinion,  that were worse than what happened Monday.  We made her leak herself. 
[00:18:00]  We smashed GIFs right in front of her  that she made with her own hands.  We didn't know she was going to react  like she did the other day.  No clue.  Hey, do I still have my package from MyStalker?  Oh, yeah.  Where the hell did that go?  I hope it got picked up yesterday  and put somewhere nice.  Yeah, well, we got to get into that.  Not throwing away garbage.  Oh, man.  It's enjoying his stalker.  My stalker.  Lynn.  I did yesterday.  Well, Mike, you make a valid point.  Thanks a lot, boys. 
[00:18:30]  Yo, I've been listening for a long time,  and I just got to say,  you guys are freaking awesome.  I don't know.  You know, I don't think this.  I think we've told everyone  this show doesn't have a morality.  It doesn't have a conscience.  Right.  In our real lives,  we have to worry about morality  and having a conscience.  Yeah.  But here, it's a place where  we just take it to the limit.  Right.  And usually, our listeners are okay with that.  But for some reason,  this one was,  oh, hey, now you've gone too far.  Yeah.  You bunch of pussies. 
[00:19:00]  Shut up.  Who cares?  Enough.  Yeah, my own problems  with that lunatic Lynn.  I think it takes balls  to do it live on the air  in front of everybody  instead of doing it behind the scenes  like everyone thought  we should have done.  Hi, Patty.  I'm Anna Kornikova's father,  or at least I believe I am,  and I want to have A-sex with her.  How would you recommend  I go about sticking my mule  in that balloon knot? 
[00:19:30]  Oh, well, it's easy.  Just move into her house.  Just move in.  Move your stuff in.  Go to where the tennis courts  and put a little cot down  and sleep on it.  So what do I do?  I go to where they work.  Hey, Patty, over here.  Patty?  Yes, question.  I want to kidnap Russell Crowe,  and I know someone tried that in the past  and they failed miserably.  Do you have any advice for me?  Well, it's all in the persistence. 
[00:20:00]  You've got to spend four years  just being no further than  a hundred yards away from your prey.  That's all.  That's the furthest I get away.  It's cost me jobs and places to live,  but I don't care.  I'm by them every day.  And then before you know it,  you're close enough to do  whatever you want.  Hey, Patty, in your opinion,  why do you think John Lennon  didn't tell Mark David Chapman  to go F himself?  Maybe he thought the listeners 
[00:20:30]  of his music would give him crap.  So he didn't say a word.  Because then they'd go,  oh, John, how harsh you are  on Mark David.  You were too harsh.  Pulling the glasses off of his face.  Ah.  Enough.  I got a lunatic sending me  gumballs and receipts 
[00:21:00]  from grocery stores.  Where is that stuff?  I don't know.  We've got to make a new ruling here  on my side of the console.  At the end of the show,  everything that's picked up  is not necessarily garbage.  Because I just walk out of here.  And I think everything  gets thrown away.  Well, they assume it's garbage.  Something here we have to get to.  And that pile of crap  you had yesterday  from the stalker.  Another stalker.  Yeah.  Stalker Lynn.  Stalker Lynn.  Thank God she's up in Boston.  Who believes that  Anthony is her father.  I'm her father.  You are.  Opie is the father  of her boyfriend. 
[00:21:30]  Her boyfriend, Joey.  And she keeps asking for money.  And she actually sent receipts  from grocery stores  with things like  ho-hos and yodels.  And she's fat.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Keep eating them, fatty.  She's a wacky old slob.  And she thinks I'm her father.  So she wants me to reimburse her  for this stuff.  So she's sending receipts  with notes on the back.  Daddy, can I,  can Joey stay over  our house tonight?  Please, please, please.  I'm sorry about the fight  we got into.  And I'm just like, 
[00:22:00]  what the, what the hell  is this one about?  Limo Ann, what's up?  I know you still hate me,  but I miss you.  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  I'm trying to change the subject.  Can I tell everyone something?  Ann and I were discussing  this in the back room.  I want to, I want to  look at what I hear.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You shut up.  Hold on, hold on.  Go ahead.  All right.  We were discussing this  in the back office,  and the listeners need to know this.  We work in a mental institute.  Yeah.  We have all these mentally  mentally unstable people 
[00:22:30]  all around us,  and we're supposed to understand  how they feel  and how they're going to react.  Including myself.  All right.  Hold on for a second.  This is, this is what I said.  Wow.  You're dead.  Wow.  The guy doesn't shut up.  We're trying to say something.  God damn shut up.  I'm sorry.  Christ.  Go ahead, Anthony.  We work with lunatics.  They come in. 
[00:23:00]  They hang out.  They stalk.  Whatever.  They attach themselves  somehow to the show.  We are partially responsible  because we entertain this  because sometimes they have  something entertaining  to say on the air.  But we are not qualified  as mental physicians  to care for these lunatics.  So we do it in our own  inimitable fashion,  which is not correct  if you want to go to a doctor  and say,  how should we deal  with a mental patient like this?  Here's another one on the phone. 
[00:23:30]  He thinks I hate him.  And he doesn't shut up.  I never said I hate you.  You want Dom Perignon?  And then he wants to be loved,  so he brings gifts.  He brings gifts.  This is the crap  we have to deal with.  No, I want to just drink.  It's not bringing gifts.  I want to drink.  Why are you calling the show today?  Yeah.  Because you, first of all,  told me I suck in softball.  Rick tweaked me in the outfield  when I came over  and he saw me  and told me I blew him off.  And I'm upset.  You did blow us off, asswipe. 
[00:24:00]  You blew us off on Thursday.  It's when you need a visit  or you need to get your work  to the airport.  So?  You don't want to say hi.  But that's what you do.  You take people to the airport.  That's why I call you.  Absolutely.  And I like when you call me.  I'm a lunatic.  We're supposed to treat these people?  Are we supposed to give them a bed  and treat them for their mental diseases?  I'm willing to take the brunt  of Patty's hate from everybody  because the whole,  your whole audience hates me.  I'll come in and take the brunt.  Another person who's jealous  of the attention 
[00:24:30]  that another person on the show  was getting.  Absolutely.  Who said the whole audience hates you?  And could I jump in and say that  maybe Rick doesn't call to say hi  and he does call  just for a limo ride or whatever,  but that does probably translate  into a plug once in a while,  which is worth a lot of money.  I'll be 30 minutes late, right?  Yes, you are.  And Anthony,  I hate to tell you this,  the whole audience  doesn't even know you exist.  I know that.  But in your whacked out world,  you think you're a big part  of the Opie and Anthony show  and you think everyone hates you. 
[00:25:00]  No one cares about your stupid life.  I think so,  but you have to get technical now.  It's called being honest.  Thank you.  D.D. Ramone is dead  and he lives.  We have so many people  attached to the show  that they're just flat out delusional.  Me too?  Yes!  Want Dom Perignon?  See?  And he's serious.  All right.  Well, if that's how you feel,  I apologize.  Please seek help, Anthony.  Please.  I need it. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, but we went on two for four.  We would have won by at least ten.  Thank you.  See you.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hey, I made the awful mistake  of taking in Patty for a week.  Ah, let's hear how that fun was.  Now, who are you?  I'm the girl in Brooklyn  that took her in the day  after the Eddie incident.  Oh, okay.  Eddie, oh, yeah.  That's another story in itself.  The Eddie incident, yes.  Okay, go ahead.  So I took her in the first night.  I fed her, you know, 
[00:26:00]  tried to bathe her.  It didn't work.  She didn't shower for the entire week.  Wait, wait.  She was there for a week.  A week.  And she didn't shower?  No.  She claimed that she couldn't get her foot wet.  So I told her, you know,  we can wrap it up.  I have a stand-up shower stall.  You know, you can get in there.  She didn't shower for a week.  All right.  Well, some people do that.  Well, then, you know,  I gave her a room. 
[00:26:30]  Next thing you know,  she's infiltrating the house.  She's on my couch with her feet up,  watching cable, taking over.  She just took over the entire house.  Really?  Yeah.  And I heard she spilt stuff?  She spilt stuff.  She stained my carpeting.  She's just a slob.  But she knew exactly what she was doing.  Yeah.  You know, she's not how everybody thinks,  all innocent and not at all.  She's a lot more crafty.  More like an evil genius. 
[00:27:00]  An evil genius.  And now she looks like Dr. Evil.  Well, I was hoping to get her out of here  before you guys shaved her.  Yeah.  Because I live in a pretty decent neighborhood.  I live in Manhattan Beach.  Uh-huh.  And I really couldn't see her coming home to my house.  Was she appreciative at least?  She claimed she was,  but, you know,  she used the phone whenever she wanted to.  She was coming in at 2 in the morning.  She'd be sitting watching TV  when she was supposed to be out  looking for a place.  No, I'm not going to lie. 
[00:27:30]  It sounds like, you know,  kind of normal things that someone would do  if you invite them into your home.  Take over, you mean?  Well, sure, in a way.  And not sour?  Huh?  And not sour?  And not, yeah, I mean,  you know,  you can't force someone to shower.  You shouldn't have to.  Well, she said,  I'll only be here for a few days.  I'm going to be out every day  looking for a place.  And she wasn't.  Of course not.  All right.  Well, thanks, Callum.  You're welcome.  My wife O'Reilly, as they say.  I got this email from Kelly. 
[00:28:00]  Another Kelly.  Yeah.  Maybe instead of giving  Stalker Patty money  and negative attention,  you guys should set her up  with a psychologist.  Self-induced poverty  for the purpose of getting  nurturing attention  is a serious problem.  Like people with,  oh boy,  that fake illness disease,  Anthony?  Oh, the...  It's called...  Munchausen by proxy syndrome.  You knew that?  Yeah.  It is Munchausen syndrome.  Very nice. 
[00:28:30]  Stalker...  How do you know  the name of it?  I always said,  I know a little bit  about everything.  Were you...  Munchausen?  I don't know a lot  about one thing,  but I know a little bit  about everything.  You know about  Munchausen syndrome?  That's a syndrome...  I've heard of the illness  or whatever,  the syndrome,  but I didn't know  the name of it.  Yeah.  It's when parents,  usually a mother,  keeps their child sick  keeps them sick  and hospitalized 
[00:29:00]  and keeps them ill  just for their own...  So they get attention.  They feel important.  You know,  it gives them a life.  They're going to the hospital.  They're talking to the doctors.  You know,  it gives them a life  and that's what it's called.  Stop.  That's not funny today.  Stalker Patty knows that  as long as she's pathetic  and destitute,  her object of desire,  Opie,  will notice her  and give her  some kind of attention,  whether it be  verbal abuse,  money,  or pity.  She's seriously disturbed.  Now that you've  severed ties, 
[00:29:30]  she might do something  drastic like getting  herself hospitalized  or maybe even  proxy illness  where she tries to  poison or maim  one of you.  And it's Munchausen  syndrome by proxy.  What?  That's what it is.  Munchausen?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm being serious.  You need to get  a restraining order  and some psychological  profiling done  on that woman.  Mangling and extensive  wounds are on their way  if something isn't done  about that psycho  bindle stiff street  Arab from hell.  Kelly Kay.  Hmm.  A lot of mothers  will even kill their kids 
[00:30:00]  like they keep having  kids and killing them.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's really awful.  Usually small town  because their retarded  doctors don't notice  that they've been murdered.  What a shame.  She had eight kids  in a row die  and these idiots  don't know  that she's doing it.  It's some wacky,  it's never the same thing  or genetic thing.  It's this one drowned  or this one had  poisoning  and they just let them  keep having kids.  Ryan, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good.  Good.  I just had you guys  back on this. 
[00:30:30]  I mean, I'm a new listener.  I've only been listening  to her about six months.  Okay.  But every time  that she's been on the show,  you guys have never said  that you were her friend.  You told her straight up  that you were just using her  for good radio.  I mean, how could she not  expect any bit more  to get her ass kicked off finally?  So I think you guys  did the best thing  you could for her.  And by the way,  I checked out  Norton's website,  eatabullet.com.  Yeah.  And I saw the article  in there.  Was it the film  selfie acquired, Norton?  Yes.  Yeah, and I was wondering 
[00:31:00]  if you could go over  your five rules of comedy  or whatever the hell  that was.  I never said that.  I don't have  five rules of comedy  in the report.  I put one of Norton's  rule of comedy  number one.  I never wrote that.  I think that makes  a good point, though.  We've never told  Stalker Patty,  you know,  she's a friend  or anything.  And she was okay  with that  because it gave her  a life.  You know,  she got to hang around.  There you go.  Gave her a life.  She got to see  some great things.  Right.  When we did that  road show in Philly,  we threw her on the bus  with the rest of the freaks  and they all had a ball. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  She loved the attention.  Well, yeah,  she shaved her head  for you, too.  We gave her a lot of things.  But we never said  she was our friend  or anything.  Right.  Please.  All right.  When we get back,  the Lady Di Marien  thing's heating up.  More retards,  more mentally challenged people  that for some reason  we should be qualified  to treat.  I don't know  how many times  I could say this.  I know I went 
[00:32:00]  too far.  Let's do it!  What the F  do you want from me?  Yeah.  Enough.  Shut up.  But this show,  we've said it  many, many times,  this show doesn't have  a morality,  it doesn't have  a conscience.  We have that  in our regular lives.  It's a place  we could go  and do stuff  and maybe  you as a listener  hear things  that you would never  hear in your regular lives.  Right.  It's kind of  a guilty pleasure.  The show doesn't  even seem to be living. 
[00:32:30]  As soon as we decide  that the show  does have a morality,  this show is effed.  Right.  Completely effed.  So I stand by  what I did.  Is that it?  Are we through this now?  Have we gotten through it?  We're not through it.  The email is ridiculous.  Screw the people  writing the emails.  Don't write,  don't listen,  eff off.  That's all.  That's all. 
[00:33:00]  I'm sorry to say  I'll no longer  be listening.  Oh, yeah,  try it.  Yeah,  after you hear  a week of  Leonard Skinner tunes,  you'll be back.  There you go.  Where are you going?  You just might.  Yeah,  awesome.  Awesome.  Where are you going?  There?  Stop it.  You might hate me more,  but you'll be back.  Damon,  what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  I am so fed up with this.  I know.  I support you guys  no matter what you do.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:33:30]  It doesn't matter.  Like, right now,  if you guys went up  with a carpet knife  and started slicing  baby soft spots,  I don't care.  It doesn't matter  what you do  as long as you're  on the radio  and there's so many  other topics  and so many other  things that you guys  could be doing right now.  Right.  Instead of going over  me.  Hey.  Sorry.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  That's right, go ahead.  I'm just really adamant  about this.  I've been listening to you guys  for almost four years  and it's just not fair  to keep on hearing this.  Like, it's funny  every so often  but you keep on repeating  the same point  and it's not your fault 
[00:34:00]  because the listeners  who don't know you  would like to say they do.  I want everyone  to realize, too,  this did nothing  as far as Patty goes.  Patty will be around  sooner than later.  She's already hanging out  at events again  and she's very, very happy.  She's extremely happy.  Right.  She's so happy  at the attention  she's getting.  She got a whole room  of people to, you know,  sing happy birthday to her.  Ugh.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  I mean, that's not  a wrong thing to do 
[00:34:30]  but it just plays  right into the whole  damn thing.  She's going nowhere.  You're playing  into the whole thing, too,  but we keep on talking  about it.  Because we don't know  what the F to do.  Just go on,  just honestly,  go on with your lives  about it.  Go on with other things.  Right.  We've tried a lot of things.  We don't know what to do.  I mean, like,  why don't you just  tell Stinky  not to answer these calls  like just pass the screenings?  That's right.  Well, this is one of those  hot topics.  I mean, it will fade  into the archives there,  I guess,  but for now,  it's a very hot topic. 
[00:35:00]  I guess.  But she's,  I mean, she's gonna,  she's,  nothing's gonna change.  But there's definitely  a percentage of your fans  that support you  and know what you do,  so just don't even  worry about that  because these people  will come back anyway  when they go to, like,  Iraq or wherever else  and listen to crack.  All right, man.  Thanks.  All right, Norton, you're all.  Bye.  Thank you, sir.  I guarantee she's  listening right now.  Guarantee it.  Of course.  Of course.  All right, Anthony.  And the Lady Di stuff  actually is funny.  Oh, yeah.  And the Marion stuff  is funny  because now Marion 
[00:35:30]  has left a message  on Rick's machine  about what went on yesterday.  We'll get into  that whole mess.  We got a 13-year-old tape  of Rich Voss doing comedy.  And I,  the material is horrendous.  I just wish  we could all see it together.  Is a clip going up  on Foundry?  I think Steve already  put it up.  Oh, great.  Then, if you want to see  what this looks like,  go to foundrymusic.com  and check it out. 
[00:36:00]  And then you could  laugh along just picturing  this awful Voss.  But for the people  that don't know  what Voss looks like,  Yeah.  has Steve done a little,  like,  this is Voss today,  this is Voss 13 years ago?  I don't know.  Because that's what  makes it really effing funny  to compare the two Vosses.  They're horrid.  He's horrid.  Anthony,  can you take care  of this one, please?  What's that?  Dave.  Yeah.  Go ahead, real fast.  Why do you keep saying  she's going to be back  no matter what?  Just weigh your foot down.  Don't let the freak back in. 
[00:36:30]  She's that persistent.  And there's,  what are we going to do?  Say that she can't  hang out on 57th Street?  Ignore her?  Well, in terms of the studio,  you have full control  over that.  No, not really.  No, because something else  that has come out  in the e-mails.  You know,  people think that  we're demanding  that she stays off  other radio shows.  That's not true.  No.  That's not true.  She'll be on other radio shows  here at WNEW.  Of course.  You can watch.  And you know what?  If other shows  want to use her,  fine.  You know,  I'm not going to 
[00:37:00]  stand in their way.  I'm sick of hearing that, too.  But we don't have to hear  on the air again, right?  I mean,  can you promise us that?  Well,  half the listeners  that just want to feel  good about themselves  that this got resolved,  they just need to hear  her voice on the radio again.  They just need to hear  that she's okay.  I'm telling you,  she's fine.  Ant saw her the other night.  We talked about this yesterday.  Nothing phases this lady.  Thank you, Dave.  Yeah, thanks.  Oh, silly me. 
[00:37:30]  See, I went to Foundry Music.  I was looking for the Voss clip,  and I think I just deployed  a satellite from the space shuttle.  Inadvertently.  It's not up there,  or I just can't find it  on Foundry again.  It's not up yet?  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Okay, so in the New York area,  877-692-1027,  anywhere else outside  of New York City,  866-277-4WOW.  Coming soon.  Coming soon  to the Opie and Anthony show.

[00:47:30]  I don't want to waste my time  Become another casualty of society  I'll never fall in love  Become another victim of looking for money at that time  Ah, another band we're checking out at the River Rave Sunday, Sunday, Sunday  Oh yeah, very excited  Taking the party to Boston, we can't wait  We'll be broadcasting live Monday from WBCN  But first, it's the River Rave Sunday  Sum 41, Fat Limp  Tickets still available, by the way  Get yours today  Kim, real fast 
[00:48:00]  Hey  Hey  I just wanted to make a point to everybody that's calling up and whining about Patty  That, first of all, yeah, okay, it sucked a little bit when he ripped his wig off her head, okay  For a second, you're like, your heart goes out to her  But the woman shaved her head, not once, but twice  So obviously she's okay with that  And she's brilliant because now the world is going out for her 
[00:48:30]  So that's all I have to say  I think everybody should just shut the F up  Now she loves the attention  Yeah, she does, and now she's got it  We're all playing right into it  I know  Thank you, Kim  You're welcome  Nah  What?  I said enough, let's move on to the other lunatics  The lady die thing is hilarious  Anthony, believe it or not, Anthony came up with this one  Because I'm getting email about this too  That my cruelness just continues  No, no, this is completely  I think this is perfect for this situation 
[00:49:00]  This is a brilliant idea from my pal Anthony  Perfect for this situation  And I fully support it, my friend  And it's based on, in part, what happened with the whole Patty thing  Everyone's big outrage, shut up  Lady die  You know her  She's half of the retarded Laverne and Shirley  Not the hot one, that's Marion  Let's do it!  Let's do it, Marion  Now, I think over the time that they've been coming in here  We've all noticed Marion seems to be the one 
[00:49:30]  With a little more to give to the show  You know what I mean?  She's the one, she's really off the wall  She doesn't take any guff from anybody  Yeah, but she might do a lot of things behind the scenes, Anthony  You think?  Yeah, she might  You know?  On the air, annoying, whatever you want to call her  It's entertaining  And then people come in  You know, when Voss is in here  And she's in here  And they're going at each other 
[00:50:00]  Classic  It's fun  She might be behind the scene fighting battles  And coming up with cute promotions  Where you put stickers on your car and stuff  I don't know, I'm just going to throw that out there  Today  But Lady Di  We're talking about Lady Di and Marion, right?  Okay  But Lady Di, on the other hand  She does a lot of things that people don't realize how funny they are  Yeah 
[00:50:30]  I think Lady Di is really funny if you really look into it  Christ on a pony  You asses  Go ahead  Lady Di, I don't know  There's nothing there  She comes in with Marion  And we're like  It's always, what about me?  What about me?  Eh, I got a haircut too  I lost weight too  I'm there  And she is just a big zero  Nothing  Marion  Let's do it! 
[00:51:00]  Listen to that lunatic  That's great  Lady Di, nothing  I must say, she does voices very well  Are you saying that basically she's riding Marion's coattails?  Oh, yes  That's what I'm seeing  They come in here  And  But you know  And I hear that Lady Di discovered Marion while she was working for, you know, a garbage company  And that should mean something, right? 
[00:51:30]  Sometimes it takes me a long time to get a joke  You finally got it  I'm just saying  I'm going  Where is he going with this?  Anyway, go ahead  So we kind of, um  Well, yesterday was the last straw  We took a call from Lady Di  And she's just whining and whining  Because of this  Let's do it!  We have a Marion little sound bite now 
[00:52:00]  It's on my little sound board  We play it when appropriate  Lady Di?  She don't have one  And she freaked out  She's bummed that she doesn't have a little sound bite  She's so jealous of her friend Marion  And, uh, she doesn't understand  She just doesn't understand why Marion's getting all the attention  Let's do it!  So, uh, we kind of, uh, put an ultimatum to her  And I think this is going to continue  Along with everyone else 
[00:52:30]  That is kind of what we like to call the hangers on  The mental patients  The mental patients  We're going to put a list together of all the mental patients  That help us with the radio show  And there's a very good, uh, possibility  But who are we kidding?  We can't say goodbye to anyone  That we're going to lose three of, uh, of the mental patients  Before the end of the summer  Right  There's a possibility they're going to be  They're going to be put on the bubble  And they're going to survive, though  Yeah  You never know  So you've got to explain that  Here's how it's going to work  Since, uh, so many people seem to have such a problem 
[00:53:00]  With the way we deal with, uh, getting rid of people  Lady Di has a week from tomorrow  A week from tomorrow  To come up with something  An idea  That she is going to then come in  A week from tomorrow  On the show  And do this idea  Whether it's  Some kind of stunt  A performance  She's going to get in front of a mic  And do something  I don't know  We don't know what it is  She's got to come up with it  The audience will then vote  Is she a commodity to the show 
[00:53:30]  Is she somebody involved with the show  That is doing something  Does she need to be here  Anytime, ever  And it'll be based on  What she comes up with  In, uh, in a week from tomorrow  Right  And if the audience, uh, votes  That she stays  And says  Well, you know  Uh, she's annoying  She's a pain in the ass  She couldn't, uh, do anything  Uh, but then all of a sudden  She pulls off this thing  In a week  And the people go  Wow, you know 
[00:54:00]  Alright, maybe she's coming up  With stuff like this  We should keep her  Yeah, keep her around for a while  Then they will vote accordingly  And she will stay  Otherwise  Gone  Goodbye  Who do you think the next person  On the bubble will be?  Well, we're going to  Hire it now  I've already figured it out  You have?  Without a doubt  Really?  Limo Ant  Yeah  Oh  Limo Ant  Oh, yeah  I must say  He gave us  One of the best bits ever  Darts  When he allowed us  To throw darts at his back  For plugs  For his limo company 
[00:54:30]  He hasn't given us  Much since then  Nothing  See, there's, you know  This has  You have to re-up  Every so often  You've got to re-up  On this show  You've got to re-up  Your membership  With the Opie and Anthony  Radio show  You can't just sit back  On your past glories  Uh-huh  And I think you're just  Going to be able to  Pop in any time you want  Rest on your laurels  Rest on your laurels  I was going to say it  And I didn't  So we discussed this yesterday  And Marion left a message  With Rick today  Right, Rick?  Uh, yeah 
[00:55:00]  Marion actually called  And left me a message  About Lady Di  Now these two have been  Friends forever  Ever  There are pictures of them  Going clubbing in the 80s  They used to have their  Little catchphrase  Ying Yang party  High school  High school  Yeah  They've been friends forever  And this show  I think is getting between them  Connected at the disgusting hips  Yeah, but this Opie and Anthony show  There's a riff forming  Because of you and I  Now  Yeah  See, Marion  You'll hear it  You'll hear it in this message  That Marion left on Rick's machine  Check this out 
[00:55:30]  Hi, Rick  Hi, it's Marion  I heard the show  I think it's good that  The dude's going to come up  With something for Diane to do  Because all I've been hearing  Out of her  She's a crybaby  I got a sound bite  She don't  And she's been crying about it  For the last four or five days  And she's acting like a jealous baby  Which I think is a little ridiculous  But I hope she comes up with something  Just to show  Shut her up  So just tell Opie and Anthony  That she's acting like a crybaby too  And she's jealous 
[00:56:00]  And I think it's ridiculous  Because she's 40 years old  She should not be jealous  We go up there for fun  So I just want to let you know  That she's doing this  Because she's acting like a crybaby  Okay  So I'll talk to you soon  And I hope to come up there  Either this Friday or next Friday  Okay  Thank you  If I wreck  End of message  Let me tell you something  I love Marion  Really  She's a very honest person  Brutally honest  Crybaby  And she keeps it in perspective  She knows she comes here  Just to have fun  Right  But some of these other people 
[00:56:30]  It gets a little too serious with them  We do have another Marion sound bite  By the way  That we played to death  I got thought of  A kind of a brain  Right  Two classics  Classics  Should we  Should we kill Lady Di  Off the show Marion  Let's do it  Yeah  She sounds excited about that  I don't know though  I think Lady Di is more of like 
[00:57:00]  A straight man  Do you?  To Marion's craziness  She's Lenny  You know something  I see where you're going with this  Lady Di  Is useless  She is useless  Hey  Don't influence the audience Anthony  It'll be up to them  What?  Lady Di might just come up with some  Something brilliant  But then again  Is it really  Laverne and Shirley  Without the one  Is it Marion and Di  Without Lady Di 
[00:57:30]  Didn't  Didn't Laverne  Leave Laverne and Shirley  The last season  And it was just Shirley  Didn't work  Did it?  No  So we should get  Lady Di and Marion  On the phone  Because I think  They need to discuss this  With each other  Oh yeah  Can you make that happen Rick?  Is she working at  The top secret cafeteria  That she works at?  The CIA cafeteria  Stacking chairs  What is ham without eggs?  What is dog feces  Without the smell? 
[00:58:00]  She's a pain in the butt  Let her go  Yeah  I wonder if Lady  Irritating  I wonder if Lady Di and Marion  Have a third wheel  Well they were hanging out  With that hot chick  For a while  As big as they both are  Do they really need a third one?  Oh Luciana  It just might be a third one around  Waiting to be discovered  Oh and I totally support you  On the Patty thing  Totally  She's irritating Tim  And the limo guy  Get rid of him  He's a pain in the butt  I don't even know  If that should go to a vote  That's ridiculous  Please  Some of those people  Are just horrendous 
[00:58:30]  It's out of control  Yeah  And you want to say  The fact that she is  Pathetic enough to try this  Cut her loose?  That alone  Because she obviously  Has no mind of her own  If she had the will  Of her own  To deserve to stay on the radio  She would have just said  I don't give an F  When you said  You had to try anything  To stay on  But no she's pathetic enough  To try anything  Like having sex with a boyfriend  First of all  Oh you heard that  Yeah her first idea  This is how desperate  She's getting already  She's like  I'll have sex  Right in front of you guys  With my boyfriend 
[00:59:00]  She didn't say my boyfriend  She goes  I'll get a guy  No she said  I'll get a boyfriend  Yeah I'll get a boyfriend  And have sex with him  In front of you  That's out of control  Will that be good enough  To stay with you guys?  You see what I mean?  Autoerotic asphyxiation  On Jamaica and Mike's mule  She should have sex  I guarantee you  That would push Pakistan  And India to the brink  Just send her and a guy  Over there  Oh my god  But you guys rock  Thank you  Alright Samantha  Thank you  Jim you're next  On the Opie and Anthony show  What's up? 
[00:59:30]  Guys what's going on?  Hey  I've been listening to you guys  For years  I'm from Worcester, Mass  And what is it  With these nutcases  Following you guys around?  I mean  Remember Wheelchair Fred?  Yeah  We loved  Wheelchair Fred  I mean he was great  But come on  He loved Wheelchair Fred  I mean  What was the other  Kippy love?  Yeah we've been doing this  For a really long time  Kippy love  It's partly our fault  I mean  Where did these people come from?  You know what  Well you know what  In Massachusetts 
[01:00:00]  We had kind of the same problem  Like Wheelchair Fred  Was one of these guys  That came around a lot  I need a bitch  Next thing you know  We're dishing out money  And buying him  Electronics  God I forgot about that  He used to like  Take a cab to the station  Next thing you know  We're driving him home  And then people wanted to kill me  When I made like  I was a faith healer  Oh  Oh  We haven't told a story  In two months  Jim I gotta let you go  Hey thanks guys  Boy that reminds me  This is one of my favorite  Anthony evil moments 
[01:00:30]  That reminds me  Because a lot of people think  I'm just the evil guy  Anthony did one of the sickest things ever  I could blame mine on alcohol  Oh come  We were all having it  Sometimes you're going to use that  As an excuse  You gotta take responsibility  For your actions  Every once in a while  True  We were at a live appearance  We had  Wheelchair Fred  There  He used to show up  At all the appearances too  Very similar to other people  Didn't we go see  I want to see like  Say like  Angry Chair or something 
[01:01:00]  The Alice in Chains  Tribute Band  Or was it Free Ballin'  I don't remember  Why?  A little local reference  Except the mood  A little local reference  From Massachusetts  A local reference  But anyway  It was in a club  Yeah we were doing an appearance  It was a club  A small club  And it was packed  I mean you couldn't move  It was like  Four or five hundred people maybe  And we used to bring  Wheelchair Fred around  To a lot of our appearances  And people loved it  He's wheelchair bound  He's not paralyzed  But his legs don't work  Because they were smashed 
[01:01:30]  In a motorcycle accident  Old guy clipped him  Yeah  Guy couldn't talk  Because his  Trachea was crushed  In the accident  And everyone thinks  He's retarded  He's totally there  Yeah he's totally there  In the head  He just  And it's like  That's  For hours  He'll just babble  At you like that  For hours  And he'd come up  To the station  And it was always  I need money  To get home  To die 
[01:02:00]  And I'm like  Alright Fred  You know you toss him  Some bucks  You do this  You bring him around  It kind of gave him a life  So we take him to this club  And I'm getting a few in me  And I had seen him  In the studio  I had seen him  He's sitting in his wheelchair  But like I said  He's not paralyzed  His legs are just so banged up  That he can't support himself  With them  So I had seen him  Stand up  Out of his wheelchair  Using his hand  To hold the console  Alright that's key  Right  He still had dead legs 
[01:02:30]  Wait  His legs were dead  What he was able to do  He has such upper body strength  He was able to do this  And just hold himself  With his arm  One hand  He was holding himself up  And then  He let go  He had recoil strength  And teetered  Like a toddler  Learning how to walk  And then  Grabbed the console again  But I saw him  Unsupported  Standing on those  God damn legs  For a split second  For a second  I don't care  Alright  I saw it  And Ant decides  So I'm going  Alright this is a great opportunity 
[01:03:00]  I'm going to do  The faith healer bit  And Ant decides  To exploit it  Because a lot of people  Didn't know  That he  Hadn't had spine injury  You know  They thought he had  Spine injury  And he was paralyzed  So I'm like  If I do a faith healer thing  Touch his head  And he stands up  Out of this god damn chair  The place is going to go wild  You know  So I'm playing  The whole thing up  And Fred  Do you believe  In the powers of Jesus  Yeah  I believe  I'm going to walk  Now  I believe 
[01:03:30]  I'm like  Alright you feel  The power surge  In through your butt  And the power  The place at this point  Just going nuts  So they're worked up  Into a god damn  Nazi Nuremberg frenzy  They're with you man  It was amazing  And this is what's sick too  They're all with you  Even though they know  In the back of their heads  There's no way  This guy's standing  But they're with you  Yeah  And they're cheering  Go ahead  So I smack him  In the forehead  And I go  Fred  Get out of that chair 
[01:04:00]  Okay  I'm going to walk  He lifts himself up  With his arms  On the wheelchair  So he's just about standing  So he's just about standing  He lets go with one hand  He's leaning real hard  With the other  And his other hand is shaking  At that point  The place is now like  Oh my god  The guy's getting out  Of the wheelchair  At this point  You take the wheelchair  From him  Yeah  He teetered  A bit  His legs were shaking  And he fell flat 
[01:04:30]  On his face  Dude  With nothing to support him  Because his legs are dead  The sound from the audience  And hold on  No no no  Hold on  And when he was falling  He grabbed the microphone  And the microphone stand  Oh yeah  And we all know  How that could support you  Thinking oh my god  I'm desperate  And he grabs the mic  And goes boom  Head first  So it made it that much louder  To the audience  Because the mic hit  Right when he hit it  So it's like  Ah  Boom  Just boom 
[01:05:00]  Hit  Sack of potatoes  They wanted Anthony dead  It went from  Oh my god  He's pure to cripple  To  And it wasn't funny anymore  Then silence  And then  Total silence  And then just  Crap being thrown at us  From the back  Hey that ain't funny  You mother effer  Yeah what the hell  You suck  Boob  And guys are working their way  Toward the stage  To beat the crap out of them  People start throwing beer bottles 
[01:05:30]  Hated me  And the shirts we just gave them  And the CDs  I mean it was a nightmare  Wanted to kill me  Well we were troopers  We hung in there  Yeah  We quickly said  Hey get us another box of t-shirts  Yeah once you throw them out  They're like  Yeah alright cool man  And we started handing out  Like the wow shirts  To the people in the front row  That were trying to get on stage  To beat us up  And like oh alright cool man  Oh they're stepping on Fred now  Just to get the shirts  You know  Yeah what did you do  Oh sure  I go  Get a foot off my back 
[01:06:00]  And he continued doing stuff  For us after that  See so I'd been hated  There was a small point  In a club  Where it was pretty bad  I was taking some abuse  That's great  We can't get Lady Di Marion  Alright we'll work on that  Okay  Alright  Yeah  You guys heard that  That Dee Dee died right  Dee Dee Ramone Anthony

[01:18:00]  We gotta get rid of any guy  That wants to take a big C  In his A  And suck on C  I  I would do that  Yes  Yes  You say anything  Just to be able to talk on the air  Look at those big  Dopey headphones  That you have  Why are you here?  I'm talking to Rossi  Weren't you just on the phone?  Yes  I was on my way in  I'm talking to Rossi  Why?  On the floor of the 68th  Democratic National Convention  You need the big antennas  Sticking out of your headphones 
[01:18:30]  That's funny  I'm thinking it's Ron Koldix  Am I wrong?  No, it was Dan Rather  It was Dan Rather  Yeah  And he got in a little  Tussle  A little pushy match  Look at you  Look at you  Stop  What are you looking at?  Things are hot, huh?  What?  Feeling the pressure right now?  No  Alright, good  Good, good  Everything's good  I'm in a barrel  And I'm doing the best I can  You have nothing  You have nothing  Do you?  No, I came in  Actually, I was seeing Rossi 
[01:19:00]  It was business  This is what 22 Cities wants to hear  It was business  You're saying  No, I just came to say hi  What do you want to talk to me?  Thanks, Angel  Please?  I have nothing  Nothing  You were on the phone with us  A few minutes ago  Because I was trying  It didn't go well  No, I was trying to defend him  Because I know she  No, no  Forget about what you were trying to do  But then now you're here for business  You were on the phone  A few minutes ago  Yes  Bitching and complaining  And now you decided  And you know what?  Now I'm intrigued  I want to hear him try to defend me  Yeah  Go ahead  No, because I know 
[01:19:30]  What's been going on  For the four years  You  More so than anybody  I've been here more than anybody  In the beginning  Not in the last two years  In the beginning  And I see  How she would sit there  Get out of my way  How she would sit there  And stare at you  And everything else  It was an obsession for her  She did not belong  Underneath those steps  Sitting there every night  Sleeping  And that's the bottom line  And Ed can laugh at me  And Norton's just  She didn't belong in this place  She was stalking you  And that's the bottom line 
[01:20:00]  That's a brilliant analysis  No, am I wrong?  No  The lady was here  She would sit here  She was partying  Now you get the hell out of here  Now you're talking about Patty  And not yourself, right?  No  You're a dick  Mister, I've got to bring presents  Every time I come by  I didn't know  I didn't know  So I could feel loved  When they go  Oh, wow  Anthony, thank you  You didn't bring anything today?  I will go downstairs if you want  And we'll get it  And we'll hang  No, I guarantee  He bought something  I don't want anything  We weren't giving you anything 
[01:20:30]  Talking about it  We were giving you  Oh, my God  He's crazy  He's crazy  This is what I was going to say  And I think  And I know you at this point  You were on the phone  You were coming to the radio station  You definitely had a gift  For Anthony and I  We kind of made fun of that  While we were talking to you on the phone  You decided to leave that gift  In your limo  Yeah  Guaranteed  No  Ask Jamaica Mike to go in there right now 
[01:21:00]  There's nothing in there  Absolutely not  You just said  I could go downstairs and get it  I'll go down to the liquor store  If we want Dom Perignon  I'll go down to  If you want to go across the street  To the Hot Rock  We'll get wings  Things that I've done before  In the last two years  Okay  Mister  I am on the hot seat  So just  I don't know what to do right now  Ooh  What are you talking about?  I know  I don't know  Dude  The whole  Wait  I have been honest through this whole thing  I know exactly what I'm doing  He's implying that you're picking on him  This is what he's implying 
[01:21:30]  That you can't handle the heat  And you're picking on him  That's what he's saying  Well he always picks  What did you say?  We don't take limos  Quote unquote yesterday  Did you say that yesterday?  You don't  You don't  We don't  No  I know that  On a rare occasion  Sure  No  For family and friends and everything else  All I was saying  Hold on  No  Not even that  You've given me town cars  Which is nice  Whatever  I'm talking about the whole staff  Don't get technical right now  I used the limo once  I was 30 minutes late  And I was  No it's always cool  After you do town hall  To be standing out there 
[01:22:00]  At 3 in the morning  With your parents  The car should be here soon  Jim Norton  That's a true story  Jim gets a car from Limo Ant  I want a limo  I don't want to trash your business  Hold on  You shut up  I don't want to trash your business  Because you've done right by all of us  And maybe it was one of those things  Is what I was going to preface this by saying  So we don't completely destroy your business  Jim Norton plays town hall  And he's feeling all good about himself  And says  Hey mom  Hey dad  Hey sis  I'm going to get you a limo 
[01:22:30]  From Jersey to town hall  And I'm going to treat you like superstars  Because it's a big night for me  Yeah  And the night ended  With me and Jim Norton  Wondering where the F is the limo  For close to an hour  My son's sleeping  And he's calling me  He goes  My parents are sitting on the corner  Dude  If you would have showed up  He would have killed you by the way  Dude  Come on  Wait a minute  That's not  Jim you weren't  No  I was happy  You never want your parents home on time  It's always better to have them  Standing in Manhattan at 2.30 in the morning  Oh you know what  This is not a bit  I know it's not a bit 
[01:23:00]  He was pissed  Were you pissed  You know what  And I was trying to calm him down  I'm like well maybe it's  You know  On the next block  You know they got the address wrong  Maybe there's another  Maybe there's another town hall  Maybe they thought it was  You're in town  Which happened to be playing  A block down the road  It's not even about  Trashing  The company is fine  Because once the driver got here  It was me  Because most people will call up  And get it through proper channels  I didn't go through proper channels  I had to go through  No offense  But what could go wrong  After the limo arrives  You get in  And they drive you  Absolutely  The key is getting there on time 
[01:23:30]  Yeah  And I am there  99% of the time  On time  The only time was when  Ant  I think your legs come back  Once with Ant  Once with Nor  Where's Pharrell  Pharrell  Please call in right now  Oh my god  Name drops with everybody  What happened with Ant  Everybody  I was late with Ant  About  You remember  In the city  About 35 minutes  This is about  Two and a half years ago  I think I don't remember that one  Yeah  I stood there for hours  You never used me again  For hours  No it was 35 minutes  And at least you can be subtle 
[01:24:00]  Because we were talking  He was going to charge me X amount  Which was cool  But I was telling the openers  What's he charging you for  I'm like no that's cool  Because he goes look  I would give it to you for nothing  But you can't give me plugs  Yes you did say that  They don't give me  Jimmy they don't give me  You did say that  You give me plugs  Don't worry  After this segment  I'll let you give your phone number out  No problem  Hey and as far as  I was pissed at that  Because I'm like what the F  Jim is a part of the show  And you're making a pay  To limo his parents  To town hall  To see him on his big night 
[01:24:30]  Dude the only I charged him  Was $50  Hey hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Ant  Speaking of comp  Last time I used a limo with you  It was a while ago  Who paid?  It was your mother  For that wedding  Well I gave her the money  But I didn't get a freebie from you  Yeah you did  No I didn't  The last time I got a limo from you  I paid  I got a bill  And I paid  And it was on my Amex  Absolutely  And then I leave you drive  As a nice tip too  So it wasn't like  I'm just saying 
[01:25:00]  I'm not complaining  Because I said I'll pay  I don't care  I just want to call  You know what  If that happened  I would refund you right now  Because anything that has  Wait  His hand's out  Wait  Go ahead  Come on wait a minute  Anything that has to do with Ant  And his hand's out  And you or Rick  Has always been from the start  That I'll take care of it  And if you guys  I have no problem paying  You did?  Yeah  I just want to make sure  The car's there  And everything's going to be fine  I don't want to  I don't want to  No  Wait a minute  It has nothing to do with that  You guys  I started with you  You're a liar 
[01:25:30]  You know something  That you're not telling us  You slimy scumbag liar  I'm off the show  What?  Nothing  He said I'm off the show  No  Because that's not true  I've never  Since day one  Him  Confess  Liar  Confess  And I only had my parents  Going from New York  To Jersey  Not both ways  They took the train in  Oh see  There you go  Just one way back  Nothing  Because they didn't want to be  You know  An inconvenience  Because that's how Jimmy is 
[01:26:00]  Yeah  And you took advantage  And I said  Dude give me a hundred  I'll freaking drive your parents around  I just didn't want mom and dad  Assaulted by collards  What's wrong with you?  We all love the collards these days  Of course  I'm kidding  The towel heads we hate  Right  With a passion  I really did unite black people and white people  It sure has united all of them  We're all together now  I ride the subways now  No problem  I've never seen so many people pro-Indian all of a sudden too 
[01:26:30]  Support Indians  It's great  Anyway are we done?  No  No  Because that's not true  That's not true  Since day one I've been with you guys  I would never charge him  Liar!  Tell us what you know  You god damn liar!  I would never charge you  I would never charge Rick  Because that's who I started with  When I walked in here two years ago  All right  No  No  No  You're telling me I charge you  I didn't give you a slip  That's not true  You  Him  No  You I charge  Because I really 
[01:27:00]  Jim I didn't know you  I was charged  I didn't get charged  You know what  If you are  I want the receipt  Because I will refund you  Oh boy  That was two and a half years ago  Who keep a receipt?  No  It was about  It was about probably a year ago  Well if you were I apologize  No I didn't get charged  We tipped the driver  Yes  Exactly  I'm not complaining  That's the deal  I'll tell you right now  That's how it always has been  No  I wouldn't have minded getting charged  I leave the driver's great tips  I would have been charged  But I got charged too  I believe it might have been  The limo with my family  To go see Aerosmith  Out in Jones Beach 
[01:27:30]  I bet I was  Yes  I was charged for that one  And being charged  Wouldn't have been a big deal  It would just sit there  And you don't even like  Sit there and say anything  Because I would never  What?  Because you're a dick  Watch out with the language  Watch out with the language  Hey, hey, hey  Hey  We're out of dump  Don't curse anymore  Relax  Oh my God  Let me tell you something  Since day one  Since I started  I take care of him  I take care of him  And you  That's been the rule  That's been the rule  That has never been the problem  So then if you have had that 
[01:28:00]  I don't care I'm charged  God damn annoying  Don't get making a radio bit now  It's not a radio bit  No, you're wrong  You're wrong  You know what?  And you're a dick  Okay  Alright?  And you sabotaged me twice  Wait, how did he sabotage me?  He did not sabotage me with Frenchie  Did he not sabotage me with Frenchie?  Sabotage?  French words and everything  Frenchie?  I did not  No, I didn't  Frenchie called in on his own  No, forget about Frenchie 
[01:28:30]  Hold on  What?  No  No, no, no  No, no  When Frenchie was in studio  I don't want to hear about that  The whole  Your whole audience hates me  I don't care  I don't care  I care about what I did  We never said that  Whatever  No, wait, wait  Hold on  I'm going to stick with the facts here  You did say something  I've never been charged  You're right  You're 100% right  So relax on that  And him  I've been charged  And you even told me that day  I'll refund you right now  You even told me that day  Dude, I'm going to have to charge you 
[01:29:00]  Yeah  And I was charged  Which is fine  Which is fine  I'm not  I don't care about the freebie  I don't really  But don't make it sound like  I'm always  No, no  That we're always trying to get the freebie  Audience, I don't care about you  God damn audience  It has nothing to do with that  It has to do with your family  I started with you guys  Whatever you want  Whatever you want  Okay, that's the bottom line  I didn't know him  I charged him just a tip  You know me for two years, stupid  What are you talking about?  Dude  Hold on  Dude  Now I've got to call you out  You didn't know Jim Norwood was playing Town Hall  No  Jim, I've been 
[01:29:30]  He's been on the show for years  And I didn't care about the trial  It was quite a lie  Like Memento  He's got a tattoo stuff on him  No, I wasn't complaining  It was just the way he said it  Hold on, hold on  I would give it to them  Because they plug  Don't be so obvious  This is too good for the radio  You didn't know who he was?  No, I met him through here  I never knew who he was  No, I didn't know who he was before  Oh my god  So when he ordered a car  No, he had been here a few times  I'd met him a couple times  A few times?  April, I know you for almost two years  Oh my god  Your head really is shaped like Peter Boyle's 
[01:30:00]  I wasn't in there that much  I haven't been in there the last year and a half  No, seriously  I haven't been in here the last year and a half  For a lot of times  Jim has been doing the show with us  I know he has  For about two years now  I wasn't here a lot of times  I really wasn't  So you're like  Who's this Jim Norton  And why does he need a letter  Yeah, exactly  He goes  No, I know who he was  But Norton  Did I ask you for free?  No, Jim, you didn't  Dude  You did not ask me for anything  Hey, listen, listen  Even people that don't listen to this show  Listen to other radio shows  Knew that Jim Norton was playing Town Hall April 18th 
[01:30:30]  I still have the date in my stupid head  Right  And I  I didn't really know who he was  No, I knew who he was  Stop it  I really never met him  I'd never done business with him  He caught me going to the phone  He turned to me  He said  Aunt, I need a limo for my parents  I said, Jim, I'll take care of you  I'll do whatever I've got to do  Just tip the driver  Right?  Which, of course  Aunt, if you've ever been charged  Get the receipt  I'll refund you  I don't care  But the bottom line is  To get back to it  You sabotaged  I did not sabotage you  I did not  You did sabotage  You know what his problem is? 
[01:31:00]  You know what his problem is?  Hold on  Shut up a second  Shut up  Shut up a second  How did he sabotage you?  It was the Frenchy incident  When Frenchy was in here  Yeah  And we had him out there  So he could run in  I think you did  And we did write that line  For Frenchy, though  What line?  About his kid  No, I never said it  No, because I was standing next to this idiot  Get Frenchy on the phone  I was standing next to this idiot  The entire time  To make sure he knew  He knew when to hang up the phone  And watch the language  We're running out of dumps  I did not  You sabotaged me  You sabotaged me  You are lying 
[01:31:30]  You told me  The bottom line  You are lying  Dude, you're lying  Dude, you told me  Do not  Dude, you told me  Anything  I don't care  Whatever  Whatever said  Do not hit him  I said, whatever you do  Don't punch him in the face  Correct  Fine  That's all I said  And then you called me a pussy  Because I didn't  Because he said something about my son  But  Hold on  That was the last thing he said  About your son  Which we never heard  Will you let me talk  And I'll tell you the God's honest truth  Frenchy came in here  And he did his thing on you  And he abused your son 
[01:32:00]  You did not hit him  And I called you a pussy  But you know  Hell yeah  I would have taken him out  You know what?  You're right  Because  He told me not to  And I didn't want to get  Hold on  I got a big business  I got a house  I got a mortgage  Hold on  Hold on  Slow down  I remember  Rick kind of told you not to hit him  Okay  Right  And I was out  Hold on  I'll get through this  So why are you listening to him?  Because you never talk to me  And neither does he  So if I got to listen to him  So I got to listen to him 
[01:32:30]  Oh my god  Listen to this guy  With your attention  Someone  Come on Anthony  Stop  No no no  Oh my god  Someone trashes your son  You're right  Five feet  Hold on  Six feet from your face  And you're not touching him  I was ready to kill him  At least bitch slapped him  And you're blaming it on Ant and I  Because we don't talk to you  No  I just  He told me  You need this radio show that bad  No I didn't need this radio show  I'm just saying that  That you wouldn't defend  Your son's honor  Seriously  Oh  He told me not to  Dude  I was standing next to you out there 
[01:33:00]  When he said the line about your son  I didn't hear it  I didn't hear it  I'm standing next to you  To be honest with you  I was running  I said just don't put on the fence  Bottom line  Screw the radio show  The kid  The Frenchie  That wimp  Is six feet in front of you  Says something about your son  And you're not hitting him  Oh if I could have killed him  That's your problem  I'm five foot nine  Two hundred twenty five pounds  He's five foot eight  One hundred thirty pounds  Don't you understand  That's your problem  And no one else is in the room  No I know that  But you decided  For whatever reason  You made the comment  In the studio  He goes  You should have hit him  I said he told me not to 
[01:33:30]  And I told you five times before  I didn't hear the comment  About your son  And Hope  To be honest with you  I was running into the studio  So I heard  You were a pussy that day  Don't make me laugh  Whatever  Alright fine  Dude  Hold on  You were  You decided that  It was probably going to affect  Your status on this radio show  If you hit Frenchie  No  Yeah  It had to do with  Actually my company  You didn't even scare the guy  You could have taken him down  You're not going to get sued  For taking a guy down  And scaring the crap out of him 
[01:34:00]  I don't know  If I push him off the chair  And he hits his back  And bangs his head  Against the wall  I ain't going to hit him  But I'll shake the crap out of him  You should have shook him up  Not in here  Not in here  I should have done it out there  That's just my opinion  You handle it your way I guess  That's all  But this is your lifestyle  This is where you make your living  So you know what I mean  If I was to do it in here  You'd never know  He'd have it on tape  This is what might happen  He beat up Frenchie in here  Bad too  Thank God  I'm glad  And you don't think  I heard about him  From the company and everything  Yeah  Here's what Frenchie said 
[01:34:30]  About you after you left  I don't care how many  Dago, Guinea, Walk, Greaseball, Goombas  Come out of the woodwork  Wow  His accent wasn't a strong amount of clip  Is it true that someone asked you  For an autograph  And you charged him?  We got Mike on the line  And they had to wait for a half hour  Because he wanted to make sure  That Anthony and Opie loved him  That's not very nice  He made a Russian guy sign his name  Vladimir  Go get your present for us 
[01:35:00]  So we can all be happy  Yeah  We need some happiness  What do you want?  What do you want?  No seriously  Will you please?  Think it up  Think something yourself  Alright  Fine  But with you  If you have the receipt  Give it to me  I'll refund you  I'm not going to do that  You've got to know that  You've got to know  That's always been that way  And that's always been the policy  And that's it  You don't use it that often  Maybe once or twice a year  But that's how I do it  The policy  Is that the same policy  That you used to bad mouth my sister?  I made a mistake that day 
[01:35:30]  You know  Come on Ant  That's a bad policy  I apologize  Get your sister on the phone  And her husband  I apologize numerous times  Wait what happened there?

[02:09:00]  stupid  but we still saw  that awful tape  of your gritty  boss is the worst  I've never seen  you know what  this is not even funny  I can't be boss's friend  no more  watching that mess  anymore  Patrice is talking  about this tape  we got in our hands  of Rich Voss  doing his act  13 years ago  the R. Kelly tape  is not as embarrassing  as that one  before we get started  okay everybody  bring in their old tape  I think we already  started  we all said  to bring in  their embarrassing  tape 
[02:09:30]  and you were  the only stupid  one that said  okay  we didn't say  bring in tapes  that you want  to commit suicide  over  it's not a big deal  I don't care  you have jerry curl  in your hair  and you're a white Jew  what are you talking about  I can see through your hair  shut up  listen to me  oh he's calling you bald  you can see the real  I can see before your hair  alright  you do warm ups  you're a porno fluffer  ooh  that's what you are  you're a long fluffer  ooh  and he has woman's lips  I don't want him bad 
[02:10:00]  God I want  Paul back  oh juicy  I'm going to get you  booked on the road with me  are you part handicapped  oh what a supple pair  Paul got  I can't even look at him  I don't want to play  for 10 people  we're going to start  to work with you  oh man  look at those juicy  looks  now we were all  viewing the tape  back in the office  hold on let's get back  to Paul  we were all  viewing the tape  back in the office  boss from 13 years ago  that I voted  your look was  something of the time  yes  you know 
[02:10:30]  I'm just trying  it certainly was not  it's easy  hold on  the look of the time  this is from  Rick Fox  oh he was greasy  and drippy  hold on  hold on  hold on a second  yeah if you listen  to this music  it pretty much  gives you an image  of gold gym  workout pants  it was the  Joey Butta Fuco pants  they were 
[02:11:00]  you had hair  like Randy Watson  I bet what any  furniture you owned  was all black  laminate  oh  like you never  fell asleep on your  couch  let's just describe  it a little  but can you believe  here's the problem  here's the problem  I have  he had his  crack mouth  back then  he had his 
[02:11:30]  drug mouth  it was awful  and he got these  new porcelain  teeth  and he still  speaks awful  what  so it's not  his teeth  that's the problem  something is going on  those drugs  messed up the roof  of his mouth  or the little skin  that keeps your tongue  connected to the  bottom of your mouth  how do you still  talk the same  you got the same  hack slurp  from 13 years ago  what a dirty  greasy junk  he was  and he still is  your teeth  were so  rotted  it was rotted 
[02:12:00]  how does he  take care of his  fake ones  when his real ones  were a mess  like weathered  shutters  from a million house  shutters off a lighthouse  he looked like a sea creature  he was awful  now rich  there were actually  parking meters  in the spaces  of your teeth  it's in back  I can't look at  my friend anymore  it stinks  it is awful  it was awful  in the same little hands  13 years ago  you had long hair  you had long curly hair  and it looked like 
[02:12:30]  there was some  sort of  African American  hair product  in your hair  now stop it  don't tell me  there was nothing  in your hair  it was glimmering  what do you mean  you don't know  it was crack sweat  he was running  he was running  from the police  right before  he got crack sweat  it was drug sweat  it was vivid  and what was wrong  with your teeth  I've never seen  someone that has teeth  that rot from the right  to the left 
[02:13:00]  it was awful  I've always  your teeth were rotting  in order  yeah now  when did that  start happening  see people can't  realize what my teeth  no chloride  no fluoride in the water  prepare my teeth  to Norton's blood  okay they were rotten  alright  they start  oh see  now look  anytime I say something  you're going to stare at me  no  it's funny we'll laugh  okay okay  I had bad teeth  for my wife  oh you did  we have it in the family  wait a minute  that's not a hereditary thing  you never brushed your teeth 
[02:13:30]  those things are hideous  listen to me  you got your real teeth  absolutely  got your real teeth  certainly  you got your real teeth  yeah everybody got their real teeth  right there's no one  but fake teeth  what why  these aren't fake teeth  these are caps  you're funny  see  you're funny  you're like the Yogi Berra  of this panel  oh I can't be his friend no more  so it wasn't from the drug use  yeah 
[02:14:00]  because cocaine is known  coke and crack is known  to like Rob Pickles' teeth  what did he drink it  he drank crack  he drank  he gargled  he gargled with heroin  what was the reason  you didn't get laid  the hair or the teeth  listen  you know what the sad thing is  before I was married  I met girls all the time  even with that hair  because back then  that was the style  it wasn't  you had teeth like a Bosnian serve  how was that going to happen  you were hanging out  in front of a 7-Eleven  in Passaic  it wasn't the style  it was the style  what are those long hair  now your hair though 
[02:14:30]  it looked to me like  if the products weren't in there  it just would have looked like  you ever see the little rascals  when they're doing  the silver submarine band  and then they hit the symbol  and the guy in the booth  his hair  it just looked like  maybe you had like  frizzy hair  you know what  it was curly  but it could have got  it's like my hair was  like yours is now  only it was longer  I understand  because I have like  if I let it grow  it gets like a link  from the Mod Squad  it was probably moose in there  you know like  oh moose  probably just fell in there

[02:16:00]  how bad Moss looked  he really looked sick  I know  I did look bad  I think Moss had the first case of AIDS  he had to  I was going to say  it looked like Kenny G with AIDS  he really looked sick  it really looked sick  it was nasty  it was really nasty  I don't know why  that was the most hurtful thing  I've ever seen in my life  I've never seen anything so bad  the most hurtful thing  it was hurtful  because I love you  maybe you should  it wasn't hurtful  it wasn't hurtful  what the lady  what is that  sitting back  any advances  the black race is me

[03:03:30]  have to step  back and reassess  your place  on the planet  as a human  being  as a comic  and whether or  not you should  be sterilized  this is the  marmiest most  intelligent insult  I've ever heard  it's fantastic  I love that  thank god  I am  you bring us  all down by that  yes he does  thank you Paul  I mean look if it's  40 years ago  and you're  Milne Barber with a  huge schlong  and you're  ripping people off  why but that was  what 1976  what was that  whatever it was  I've been doing  comedy for  with the pants  the pink shirt  the Jerry  Jerry  for four years
