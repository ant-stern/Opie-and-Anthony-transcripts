<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a profane and comedic retelling of the nativity story, focusing on Mary's sexual encounters.  This transitioned into a reaction to a shocking video of a Peewee football game brawl, with the hosts, Steve Bartlestein, and Laurie Stokes expressing disgust using highly offensive language.  The hosts then shared embarrassing childhood sports anecdotes, again employing offensive language.  A caller submitted a video of Opie dancing, leading to extended teasing of Opie’s dance moves, described as a “little bounce,”  compared to Davy Jones and Ben Sparks, with the teasing occurring across numerous segments and involving both co-hosts and callers.  Locations of Opie’s dancing included a bar (FH Riley’s) and possibly a club.  Numerous XM radio advertisements aired throughout this portion of the broadcast.

A homeless musician, nicknamed "Homeless Guitar Dude" or "Popper Rock," a self-proclaimed Vietnam veteran, was brought into the studio.  His malfunctioning guitar, due to battery issues and short circuits, provided much comedic fodder.  The hosts and callers mocked his performance, attire, smell, and equipment; his exaggerated war stories further fueled the humor. Opie even attempted to play the guitar, resulting in further malfunctions. The segment concluded with the guitarist's departure and promotion of Tracy Morgan's stand-up show.

Next,  the show featured a heated phone call with a female caller, Sarah, who expressed disdain for video games and the men who played them.  This devolved into a highly confrontational exchange filled with insults and vulgar comments from both the hosts and callers, focusing on Sarah’s perceived negativity and emasculating behavior toward her husband.  The hosts speculated graphically and violently about her husband's potential retaliation. Several female callers, identifying as "broads," joined the conversation, expressing disapproval of Sarah and offering their own perspectives on relationships.  Tammy, one caller, directly confronted Sarah, urging her to "get a life." This segment also included a song by Anthony's brother Joe about internet pornography, and numerous XM Satellite Radio advertisements.

The hosts then expressed their outrage at being uninvited to XM Satellite Radio's Employee Appreciation Day in Washington D.C., speculating on the reasons for their exclusion and using offensive language to describe XM employees and management. A live phone call with Elo, an XM employee, further escalated the situation with accusations and sarcastic remarks. The hosts discussed potential pranks, including obscene phone calls and racist remarks, and later crafted a sarcastic email to XM.  A humorous email from a Nashville XM employee about their own low-budget Employee Appreciation Day was then read.  A phone call with Ron and Fez, another XM radio show also uninvited, added to the discussion,  with exaggerated accounts of their journey and sarcastic remarks about XM's supposed appreciation. Fez claimed to be receiving oral sex during the call.  Anthony's recent acquisition of World War II memorabilia, including an SS flag, sparked a conversation about collecting Nazi memorabilia and led to jokes about various ethnicities.  The segment concluded with more radio advertisements and a scandalous audio clip from Paltalk involving Big A and a listener.


A significant portion of the broadcast focused on a “phone sex” incident involving Big A, one of the hosts, and “Blaze Angel” on Paltalk.  A secretly recorded audio featuring graphic sexual descriptions and sounds of Big A masturbating was played extensively.  Listeners called in to react, expressing amusement, shock, or disgust.  Roach (who edited the video) and Blaze Angel herself provided their perspectives; Blaze Angel called Big A a "sex pest," and Roach confirmed the existence of a video recording of Big A masturbating.  The broadcast also included tech news with guest Lazlo, a discussion of dominatrix culture, and viewing and commentary on the video itself.  Further calls and reactions concluded this segment, with a promise to play additional clips and Big A's orgasm the next day.

The show included a caller recounting a bizarre sexual encounter with a dominatrix ("Nurse Pig"), followed by listener calls sharing humorous and sexually explicit anecdotes. One caller recounted a role-playing incident, and another shared experiences providing security for a dominatrix.  A lengthy, darkly comedic narrative about a man’s disastrous encounter with a dominatrix, resulting in an accidental death and a bloody bunny costume at a police station, concluded this segment.  The hosts briefly referenced Paul McCartney and The Godfather II.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony  Howdy How  Virgin Mary was sleeping  When Angel Gabriel appeared  He said you are to be the Virgin Mother  But Mary thought that was weird  Mary said I'm not a virgin  I blew a guy last year  But then Gabriel said to Mary  My child have no fear 
[00:00:30]  You can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin  Mary  You can suck all the dick you want  And still not be considered flawed  Although you went to town  And sucked some semen down  You're still a virgin  In the eyes of God  There was no room at the end  When Mary and Joseph did arrive  But they were so very tired 
[00:01:00]  You see and Mary had to offer a bribe  Since she had no money  How would she pay for a place to sleep  Gabriel appeared to Mary  And told her not to weep  Cause you can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin  Mary  You can suck all the dick you want  And still be the mother of Christ  If there's no room at the end  Then it's not considered a sin 
[00:01:30]  To suck some dick  To get a room for the night  Then three wise men did appear  Bearing gifts of myrrh and such  They said that they had followed a star  And missed a woman's touch  Mary thought she might pleasure them  But could not take them too bad  But again Gabriel appeared to her  And this is what he said 
[00:02:00]  You can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin  Mary  You can suck all the dick you want  Everyone that hangs in the nation  Felicio ain't no sin  Gonna blow those three wise men  And you'll still be a virgin  Cause there was no penetration  So you can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin  Mary  The donkey and the ox and the lambs  And even the little drummer boy 
[00:02:30]  People will remember your name quick  They'll say  Damn that bitch could suck a good dick  Cause suckin' dick brings  Peace on earth and joy  Cause suckin' dick brings  Peace on earth and joy  Mary, Mary suck that dick  You're listening to the worst  The worst  You're listening to the worst  Not the best  All of it is so bad 
[00:03:00]  It's hard to tell  Which is the worst  The absolute worst  And you're listening to  The worst of Opie and Anthony  The worst of Opie and Anthony  It's absolutely awful  Hey we got the video of the day  It's time for that story  About peewee football brawl  Oh that's great  You saw that?  I saw some of the footage on CNN  Peewee football and uh  Yeah there's a huge brawl  In the middle of the game  Oh look at that  Thank you  And Steve Bartlestein  And Laurie Stokes  Are disgusted  Are they?  Steve Bartlestein 
[00:03:30]  Is disgusted  Dis...gusted  Good sportsmanship  Was not exactly on display  This is...  This is really awful  In a peewee football game  We've seen this before too  The kids were misbehaving badly  But the dads  Right here  Five and six year old players  Watched  Another brawl  Involving parents  Breaking out on a field  In Corpus Christi  It began when a coach  Was tossed out of the game  By an 18 year old referee  Coach punched the ref  Knocked him unconscious  18 year old  Oh look at that  Did you see? 
[00:04:00]  Oh this is ugly  This is just bad  Some parents tackle the coach  To keep him away from the kids  Charges are pending  Against the coach  Man  Yeah  Disgusting  And  Another adjective  Uh...  Horrible  There you go  Why don't you get a hold of yourselves  It's not 9-11 footage  Yeah  It's a bunch of parents fighting  Brawling  But she...  She got a little feisty with him there  Yeah  What'd she say?  Another adjective?  Uh...  Horrible  That was kinda like 
[00:04:30]  Alright, we get it  We get it, it's bad  Shut the fuck up  Disgusting  Deplorable  Horrible  Wouldn't it be funny  If he just fired out other adjectives  That made no sense  It's just cunty and niggerish  It's dog shittable  Eh, what are you gonna do?  The parents are fighting out there  What can I tell ya?  Well that's why I hate kids sports  Cause the parents...  The parents really are just a bunch of fucking...  Just disgraceful jizz buckets 
[00:05:00]  Fucking showing their own dick size  For the accomplishments of their children  It really is awful  No  Horrible  No  Disgusting  Disturbing  Uh...  Hard to deal with  Uh...  Watching Dick Clark talk  Next one  Wouldn't it be funny if she should get another adjective if you want...  Cute  In general, Jimmy  Cause I do go to...  General Jimmy  Win the promotion  Well I was Corporal Jimmy 
[00:05:30]  And then I went to military school  And became General Jimmy  I gotta salute this motherfucker now  You certainly do  But it's like with the short salutes  Like the Nazis would give  Like with the foot stomp  And the little arm goes up  Yeah, I like that  How are you?  Busy  Hey, we're busy killing people  I ain't got time for all this formal crap  Kid sports not as bad as you think  You get a video like this every once in a while  Yeah  But, you know, the parents are behaving out there  It's not fair to say that all the parents are out of control  I was just saying a lot of them  No, it's a little more of that culture of fear thing 
[00:06:00]  In general, there's a lot of behaving going on  Yeah  What is happening though is like the mom's bringing the snacks for the kids  Aw, that's adorable  And giving the kid a little juicy box  Sunny D  In the dugout in between innings  Yeah  You didn't play sports growing up really, right Ant?  We didn't have any of that when we were growing up playing sports  Right  You didn't have your mom cuddling you in between innings  With little, little, little, little like sandwiches and snacks  No  When I was playing little league  When I was playing in the little league baseball 
[00:06:30]  If I wanted to drink I had to suck my mother's pussy ass  Holy shit, Jimmy  Oh my lord  At least she was there for you  That's right  It's nice  I was a pitcher when I was a kid  And I was just fucking dumpy  Catch her now  Damn it, you beat me to it  Power bottom  Are you trying to say I top from the bottom?  Now a pitcher as an adult, yeah  I was a pitcher on Young's Glass Service 
[00:07:00]  On the Royals  The Royals?  Yes  And?  How'd you do?  I've been better  I had a really weird pitching style  Instead of winding up  I would be on the mound  And I would step back  Up  And then forward  Like I would just take a step back  I wouldn't even wind up  It wasn't even a good wind up  You didn't have a good leg lift  And it was just kind of backwards, forwards  You're gonna add an extra one billionth of a mile per hour to your pitch  With that  I had no 
[00:07:30]  I had no  I remember I walked  They had such high hopes for me as a pitcher  Mr. Ryan thought I was gonna be a great pitcher  Mr. Ryan was a boob  He certainly was an ass  And I didn't do  I did particularly well in one game  Like against one or two hitters  But then they started me  And I think I walked like seven people in a row  And they had to yank me  That no-insight asshole  He was awful  Mother's cunt  Ball four  Dying a fire 
[00:08:00]  Just pull me already  Ball  Ball  Come on  Get me out of here  I'm dying here  Best effort  Ball four  Bases are loaded, no outs  How do I get out of this?  I could do this  Strike  Yes  Pulling it together  Ball four  What a  Bases walking bag of shit  You could actually hear  Da-dung, da-dung, da-da-da-da-dung  They were playing merry-go-round music 
[00:08:30]  Was it going around the bases?  Oh, it was fucking awful  I turned around  And all the players  Had a fucking stick  Coming through their backs  And through their chest  Like they were  On a carousel  The carousel  Of fat no self-esteem boy  Ball four  Strike!  The occasional torture of strike  That's right  It's three and one  Let's go to Randy in Houston  Randy  Hey, what's up fellas?  Hey Randy 
[00:09:00]  I was like  I think I was kind of raised  To hope he was  When you were a kid  And you were playing Little League  If you wanted a goddamn drink  You had to wait  To the end of the damn nine innings  If you were injured  Get out there and fucking play  That was my dad's stance  Yeah, because my nephew JD  Is big into the baseball there  And I've gone to a lot of the games  And you see a lot of athletes  But you see these moms  And they're just like  Hanging around the dugout  Like handing food to their kid  In the dugout  JD doesn't get the food 
[00:09:30]  And the juices really  They want to be part of it  For the most part  They want to be part of it  It's all about snacks  And it's just a fun day out  For everybody  It's not a sport anymore  In some ways  Well isn't that kind of  Kids are trained to be pussies now  I don't know  I've got to say one thing  Isn't that  It's like we're kind of knocking that  But it's like  It was funny the way Ope just said that  Yeah, it's just a fun day out  Like, you know  I guess that is kind of  What it's supposed to be for kids  Like, you're having snacks  I'm pushed out, fellas  You know what?  You're having snacks  And hitting the ball  But the way you said that 
[00:10:00]  Like, ah!  Little cunts  Just trying to have fun  And enjoy their day  I'm  I'm the Bobby Knight  Of the peewee league  Just displaying sportsmanship  And the like  No, it's  All right  Father should go over there  And punch her in the face  Dude, there's a difference  When you get your friends together  You go to the schoolyard  You hit the ball around  You try to get a game together  Whatever  It's a fun day out  But organized sports  It's, you know  You shouldn't have mommy  No place for mommy, right?  Like hanging out on the dugout  Asking if you want some, you know  Animal crackers  Juicy  And a juice box 
[00:10:30]  My mother never did that stuff  My mother was actually  My mother was on the fence  Holding onto it  Shaking it  Going swing  She was really embarrassing  She'd go  No batter  No batter  While I was up at the plate  We want a pitcher  Not a belly  That likes to have shit on it  She'd be on the fence  Trying to rally the other team  Were you easy out guy?  Um, yeah  One point  Easy out  And I would fucking  The worst would be like 
[00:11:00]  I'll show you guys  I'll show you  Swing  Foul tip  Ball goes nowhere  It's not a good foul tip  It's I barely got a piece  And the ball would just like limply  Like my cock in adulthood  Just bounce off the plate  And technically it wasn't a fucking miss  And the coach would go  Good swing, Jimmy  Just try to encourage me  Good swing, good swing  Good piece of the ball  Yeah  And it wasn't a good piece of the ball  Good eye  No  That's how bad I was  I would take solace in my outs  Hey, when you were walking to the plate 
[00:11:30]  Did the pitcher turn around  And give the sign of everyone moving in?  Everyone come on in  Yeah  Move in everyone  No, closer, closer  The umpire would do that  The fucking  They would actually pick the fences up  And move them in  Center fielder's now playing second base  Oh man  That was awful  I told you the time that I fucking  I was up at the plate  And I hit a little dribble or foul  Up the first baseline  And it was just foul  And I stood there limply  And they were all yelling  Run!  Run it out!  And I was like  But the ball's foul! 
[00:12:00]  Run it out!  And I just stood there  And then it went fair  Oh no  And as the guy picked it up  I started running  And I got three feet  I got  I got  I got  I got  I got three feet from home  Please  Hold on a second  Let me just get the phone here  Because you know  People who don't know me  Are you the worst?  Yeah  That is funny  I got three feet away from home plate  And they threw me out  And then I had to turn around  And walk back to the dugout  Old chubby  My fucking uniform was untucked 
[00:12:30]  Would you have made it  If you started running  No  Right when you hit?  Oh I might have  Yeah  If I just  Yeah  If you actually did what you were supposed to do  Or I would have at least looked like I was running it out  But I stood there limply  While they all screamed  Run!  Run it out!  No it's foul!  I stood there like with my arms out like what?  I don't want to run it out  It's a foul ball  Little panicky Pete when it takes that turn  And it hit the grass  And it went  Right back in  And as the guy picked it up  I just started hustling it out  There you go  Like the miracle was going to come 
[00:13:00]  You hit a frunkus  The ball went  Frunkus  Oh what an ass  God that's funny  I remember one game  I was so bad  They moved me from position to position  I started out in right field  Then they moved me into third  Oh I was awful  And some kid tried to steal third  And they threw it to me  And the ball just like  My glove stood there  And the ball just went left of my glove  And he ran home  Oh what a fucking impotent mess I was  There are certain people that you know 
[00:13:30]  Wherever they are positioned  The second he has to come into play  It's like  Cause it's happening so fast  But your mind is working real quick  And you're like  Oh we're fucked  You're fucked  And there goes the ball of the throw  And he fucking missed it  One year  I actually wasn't the worst hitter  I would do okay  And this is probably  What am I  I mean I'm 38  And this was probably when I was 13  25 years ago  And I still remember my dad overheard  Some black kid on the team complimenting me  And he told me about it  The kid's name was Andy Blocker 
[00:14:00]  Andy Blocker  And he said that Jimmy's one of the better hitters on this team  And my dad reported that to me  And I never forgot it  Nice  I was one of the better hitters on that team  Hey  And I wasn't  Very nice of that  Yes it was me and Rick Allen and Christopher Reeve  Were the three hitters  And I was one of the better ones  Behind only those two  I want to start a new bit  Clean up hitter  You got to clean up Christopher Reeve's shit  And Heather Mills  Where she would just put pine tar on her thigh  And swing it  Oh my god 
[00:14:30]  I don't know why that makes sense  She only has one leg  That makes more sense if you have two  Mike and Jersey Mike  Hey what's up guys  Hey  First at bat  Peewee  Like the first year you could play baseball  Hit right in the head by a pitch  I must have stood a foot and a half away from the plate  Every time I went to bat after that  I could not  I could not get into it after that  Scared you away  Alright  Yeah I never liked that being brushed back shit  It's the Iceman Chuck Liddell  UFC light heavyweight champ

[00:26:00]  But there is a fine little dance sequence in the new Clerks 2 movie  that made me laugh out loud.  Would you?  Let's go to Dan in Boston.  Dan, what's up?  Sorry.  I got to do the thing.  Touching his own nipple with his stupid, dirty mechanic fingernails.  She's a great big fat person.  Mrs. Littman.  Mrs. Littman.  I think I got a card inside.  Jack Gordon.  You need help with that? 
[00:26:30]  Would you?  Thank you.  Greatest character ever.  Oh, what a doll he was.  Dan, hold on one second.  Tony from a lake in New Jersey I cannot pronounce.  On Conkoma?  No, no, Lake.  Hoppa-Pakon.  Lake-O-Pakon.  Lake-O-Pakon.  Lake-O-Pakon.  I don't know.  It starts with an H.  H-O-P-A-T-C-O-N-G.  Hoppa-Kon.  Lake-O-Pakon.  Oh.  Stinks.  Another Indian name.  Exactly. 
[00:27:00]  The Indians got screwed.  We took their land and then just named things after them.  It's Lake, ten bucks, now beat it.  Right.  Take these anthrax blankets with you.  Exactly.  Keep you warm.  Lake, here's a bead.  Tell your story walking, fella.  Tony's on to something.  I hope he can't dance because his wallet keeps him off balance.  That's all you're seeing.  That's all you're really seeing there is me just trying to keep everything balanced.  What I should do is start carrying two wallets in my back pocket.  Right. 
[00:27:30]  Dan in Boston, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I got an old WAF Real Rock TV tape in it.  Opie and Anthony at a WAF event and Opie's dancing in the background to one of the songs.  He looks like a total jackass.  Wow, classic.  You don't have that.  Yeah, you had Billy Idol in the studio doing an orgasm or having some girl do an orgasm for him.  Right.  And then you guys were at the Bayside Expo Center and Opie was doing like a skateboard thing,  but it wasn't really him skateboarding. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, I remember that bit.  That was funny.  It was me.  It was you.  It was Opie right at the lip of a half pipe.  Shut up.  It was me the whole time.  And he'd like jump off and then he switched clothes with this kid who was really good.  And he's like, he's got a hood pulled up over his head and he's doing some like some rad moves on this half pipe.  And then he comes flying up and of course it cuts back to Opie going, ha, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but when it cuts back to me, I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the half pipe. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  You know, and I fell on my ass and pretty much messed up my back pretty bad.  I couldn't even do that part of the bit.  There was no real skateboarding in that without dying.  I want a copy of that video.  What gave it away is your shoes changed.  Oh, there's a whole series.  My shoes changed?  Yeah, when it panned to the guy going down the half pipe, it was a different colored shoe.  Continuity error.  Yeah.  All right, boys, you rock.  All right, Dan, send that tape in if you have it. 
[00:29:00]  We'll throw it up on the website.  What the hell?  I'd love to see some of that old Real Rock TV stuff.  I got all of them.  I got all of them.  Do you?  I got every episode.

That's, what are we up to, a little over two and a half weeks away, something like that?  Yeah, about two and a half weeks away.  And I ran into John the other day outside Starbucks on 47th Street.  Yeah.  And I figured he would be a good contestant.  Yeah, what's up, John?  I don't know yet. 
[00:32:00]  Don't know yet too early, huh?  Yeah, not enough Budweiser.  Ah.  Notice a lot of homeless guys like drinking.  Sure.  Notice that.  Not surprised.  Yeah, but...  You know, got to kind of, what else are you going to do all day, right?  I got to get that kick.  I got to get that kick.  Yeah?  So you just like drink beer all day?  No, I drink about four.  Four?  Then I play all day.  And then you play.  Yeah.  So you loosen up with a few beers, and then you play, and what do you put, a little case 
[00:32:30]  out or something like that, or a hat or something?  No, you're not playing for cash, you're just playing for the fun of it.  Yeah.  Well, how does your guitar not get stolen?  I sleep on it.  Okay, that's got to be good for it.  There you go.  That's got to be good for your back.  The Fender Posturepedic.  Yeah, no kidding.  If you can tell that, you know, if I'm really messed up, I'm laying out there on top of  it.  But if I'm not messed up, just sleeping, then it's on top of me.  Yeah.  So, you know, has anyone ever tried to grab it, take off?

Looking for a fantasy product at a realistic price point?  Well, Big Game's home video arcades might be it. 
[00:34:00]  Welcome into tomorrow.  I'm Dave Graveline.  Big games are real arcade games that retail for $500, not thousands like you might think.  These things are really fun and perfect for your family room or game room if you have one.  For example, they have a Konami machine that plays 12 arcade classics like Frogger, Blades  of Steel, Green Beret, and a bunch of others, and a Midway machine that plays games like Defender 2, Robotron, and Joust.  One of my favorites is the Golden Tee Clubhouse Edition. 
[00:34:30]  It plays Golden Tee, that golf game that you see in bars and restaurants everywhere.  Hmm, just think how much money you could save on beer.  Seriously, $500 for a real arcade machine seems like a pretty good deal.  Check them out at MyBigGames.com.  Entertaining you at home and into tomorrow.  I'm Dave Graveline at Graveline.com.  Don't miss our weekend show, too.  A very bright idea.  I'm Chris Whitting with the Success Journal. 
[00:35:00]  An inventor from Salt Lake City named Lester Wire had an idea.  Back then, cars were just becoming popular.  But drivers were often reckless and accidents were common, especially at intersections.  Since there weren't enough traffic cops to stand on every corner, something new was needed.  Lester's brainstorm?  An automatic device to regulate traffic.  Having the last name of Wire was just a coincidence. 
[00:35:30]  As Les ran some wire over to an intersection, then used colored lights to signal the flow of traffic.  No doubt you've spent lots of time staring at Lester's invention, the traffic light.  While it makes some drivers see red, it delivered the green for inventor Lester Wire.

[00:36:00]  L'OBIE News Show  L'OBIE and Anthony  Virgin Mary was sleeping when Angel Gabriel appeared.  He said, you are to be the virgin mother, but Mary thought that was weird.  Mary said, I'm not a virgin.  I blew a guy last year.  But then Gabriel said to Mary, my child, have no fear. 
[00:36:30]  Well, you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin.  Mary, you can suck all the dick you want and still not be considered flawed.  Although you went to town and sucked some semen down, you're still a virgin in the eyes of God.  There was no room at the inn when Mary and Joseph did arrive. 
[00:37:00]  But they were so very tired, you see, and Mary had to offer a bribe.  Since she had no money, how would she pay for a place to sleep?  Gabriel appeared to Mary and told her not to weep.  Because you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin.  Mary, you can suck all the dick you want and still be the mother of Christ. 
[00:37:30]  If there's no room at the inn, then it's not considered a sin to suck some dick to get a room for the night.  Then three wise men did appear, bearing gifts of myrrh and such.  They said that they had followed a star and missed a woman's touch.  Mary thought she might pleasure him, but could not take them to bed.  But again, Gabriel appeared to her, and this is what he said. 
[00:38:00]  You can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin.  Mary, you can suck all the dick you want and everyone that hangs in the nation.  Felicia ain't no sin, going to blow those three wise men.  And you'll still be a virgin because there was no penetration.  So you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin. 
[00:38:30]  Mary, the donkey and the ox and the lambs and even the little drummer boy.  People will remember your name quick.  They'll say, damn, that bitch could suck a good dick.  Because suckin' dick brings peace on earth and joy.  Because suckin' dick brings peace on earth and joy.  Mary, Mary, suck that dick.  Hey, we got the video of the day. 
[00:39:00]  It's time for that story about Pee Wee football brawl.  Oh, that's great.  You saw that?  I saw some of the footage on CNN.  Pee Wee football and, yeah, there's a huge brawl in the middle of the game.  Oh, look at that.  Thank you.  And Steve Bartlestein and Laurie Stokes are disgusted. 
[00:39:30]  Are they?  Steve Bartlestein is disgusted.  Disgusted.  Good sportsmanship was not exactly on display.  This is really awful in a Pee Wee football game.  We've seen this before, too.  It wasn't that kids were misbehaving badly, but the dads right here, five and six-old players watched.  Another brawl involving parents breaking out on a field in Corpus Christi.  It began when a coach was tossed out of the game by an 18-year-old referee.  Coach punched the ref, knocked him unconscious. 
[00:40:00]  18-year-old.  Oh, look at that.  Did you see?  Oh, this is ugly.  This is just bad.  Some parents tagled the coach to keep him away from the kids.  Charges are pending against the coach.  Man.  Dude.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Disgusting.  And another adjective?  Oh, horrible.  There you go.  Why don't you get a hold of yourselves?  It's not 9-11 footage.  Yeah.  It's a bunch of parents fighting.  Brawling.  But she got a little feisty with him there.  Yeah.  What'd she say?  Another adjective? 
[00:40:30]  Horrible.  That was kind of like, all right, we get it.  We get it.  It's bad.  Shut the fuck up.  Disgusting.  Deplorable.  Horrible.  Wouldn't it be funny if he just fired out other adjectives that made no sense and she's like,  you know, the adjective, but it's just cunty and niggerish.  It's dog shittable.  Eh, what are you gonna do?  Parents are fighting out there.  What can I tell you?  Well, that's why I hate kids sports, because the parents, the parents really are just a 
[00:41:00]  bunch of fucking, just disgraceful jizz buckets fucking showing their own dick size  to the accomplishments of their children.  It really is awful.  No.  Horrible.  No.  Disgusting.  No.  Disturbing.  Hard to deal with.  Uh, watching Dick Clark talk.  Next one.  Wouldn't it be funny if she should get another adjective if you want to shoot?  In general, uh, Jimmy, because I do go to- 
[00:41:30]  General Jimmy, win the promotion.  Well, I was Corporal Jimmy, and then I went to military school and became General Jimmy.  I gotta salute this motherfucker now.  I certainly do, but it's like with the short salutes, like the Nazis would give, like with  the foot stomp and the little arm goes up and a high.  How are you?  Busy.  I don't like that one.  Hey, we're busy killing people.  I ain't got time for all this formal crap.  Kid sports, not as bad as you'd think.  You get a video like this every once in a while, but, uh, you know, the parents are behaving  out there.  It's not fair to say that, uh, all the parents are out of control. 
[00:42:00]  I was just saying a lot of them.  No, it's a little more of that culture of fear thing.  In general, there's, uh, a lot of behaving going on.  What is happening, though, is like the mom's bringing the snacks for the kids.  Aw, that's adorable.  And giving the kid a little juicy box.  Sunny D?  In the dugout, uh, in between innings.  Yeah.  You didn't play sports growing up really, right, Ant?  No.  We didn't have any of that when we were growing up playing sports.  You didn't have, you didn't have your mom cuddling you in between innings with little,  little, little, little, like, uh, sandwiches and snacks. 
[00:42:30]  When I was playing little league, when I was playing, uh, uh, in the, in the little league  baseball, if I wanted to drink, I had to suck my mother's pussy in ass.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Oh, my lord.  At least she was there for you.  That's right.  It's nice.  I was a pitcher when I was a kid, and I was just fucking dumpy.  Catch her now.  Damn it, you beat me to it.  Power bottom.  He's trying to say I top from the bottom.  Now a pitcher as an adult, yeah.  I was, um, I, I was a pitcher on Young's, Young's glass service. 
[00:43:00]  I, no, no, on, on the Royals.  The Royals?  Yes.  Yeah.  And?  How'd you do?  I've, I've been better.  Yeah, you were.  I had a really weird pitching style.  Instead of winding up, I was, I did it like, I would be on the mound, and I would step back,  up, and then forward.  Like, I would just take a step back, I wouldn't even wind up.  It wasn't even a good wind up, you didn't have a good leg, uh, lift, and it was just kind  of backwards, forwards, you're gonna add an extra one billionth of a mile per hour to 
[00:43:30]  your pitch with that.  I had no, I had, I remember I walked, they had such high hopes for me as a pitcher, uh,  Mr. Ryan thought I was gonna be a great pitcher.  Mr. Ryan was a boob.  He certainly was an ass, and I didn't do, I did particularly well in one game, like against  one or two hitters, but then they started me, and I think I walked like seven people  in a row, and they had to yank me.  That no insight asshole.  Oh, he was awful.  Ball four!  You mother's cunt. 
[00:44:00]  Ball four!  Dying a fire.  Just pull me already.  Ball!  Ball!  Come on.  Get me out of here, I'm dying here.  Best effort, ball four!  Bases are loaded, no outs.  How do I get out of this?  I could do this.  Strike!  Yes!  Fucking pulling it together.  Ball four!  Ball four!  What a bases-walking bag of shit. 
[00:44:30]  You could actually hear, da-dung, da-dung, da-dung, da-dung, da-dung, da-dung, da-dung.  They were playing merry-go-round music.  That's it going around the bases.  Oh, it was fucking awful.  I turned around, and all the players had a fucking stick coming through their backs and  through their chest.  They were on a carousel.  The carousel of fat, no self-esteem, boy.  Ball four!  Ball four!  Strike!  The occasional torture of strike.  That's right.  It's three and one. 
[00:45:00]  Let's go to Randy in Houston.  Randy.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, Randy.  I was going to say, I was kind of raised to hope you was.  When you were a kid, and you were playing Little League, if you wanted a goddamn drink,  you had to wait until the end of the damn nine innings.  If you were injured, get out there and fucking play.  That was my dad's stance.  Yeah, because my nephew, J.D., is big into the baseball there, and I've gone to a lot  of the games, and you see a lot of athletes, but you see these moms, and they're just like  hanging around the dugout, like handing food to their kid in the dugout. 
[00:45:30]  J.D. doesn't get the food and the juices, really, for the most part.  They want to be part of it.  It's all about snacks, and it's just a fun day out for everybody.  It's not a sport anymore, in some ways.  Well, isn't that kind of...  Kids are trained to be pussies now.  I don't know.  I've got to say one thing.  Isn't that...  It's like we're kind of knocking that, but it's like...  It was funny the way Ope just said that.  Yeah, it's just a fun day out.  Like, yeah, I guess that is kind of what it's supposed to be for kids.  Like, you're having snacks and... 
[00:46:00]  Nah, you know what?  You're having snacks and hitting the ball.  But the way you said that, like, ah, little cunts just trying to have fun and enjoy their day.  I'm the Bobby Knight of the Pee Wee League.  Just displaying sportsmanship and the like.  No, it's...  All right, when you...  Father should go over there and punch her in the face.  Dude, there's a difference.  When you get your friends together, you go to the schoolyard, you hit the ball around,  you try to get a game together, whatever.  It's a fun day out.  But organized sports, it's...  You know, you shouldn't have mommy, like, hanging out all the dugout,  asking if you want some, you know, animal crackers. 
[00:46:30]  There's some juicy.  And a juice box.  My mother never did that stuff.  My mother was actually...  My mother was on the fence, holding onto it, shaking it, going,  Swing, better swing!  She was really embarrassing.  She'd go, no batter, no batter, no batter, while I was up at the plate.  We want a pitcher, not a belly that likes to have shit on it.  She'd be on the fence trying to rally the other team.  Were you easy out guy? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, at one point.  Easy out.  And I would fucking, the worst, be like, I'll show you guys.  I'll show you.  Swing, foul tip.  Ball goes nowhere.  It's not a good foul tip.  It's I barely got a piece.  And the ball would just, like, limply, like my cock in adulthood, just bounce off the plate.  And technically, it wasn't a fucking miss.  And the coach would go, good swing, Jimmy.  Just try to encourage me.  Good swing, good swing.  Good piece of the ball.  Yeah.  And it wasn't a good piece of the ball.  Good eye. 
[00:47:30]  No.  That's how bad I was.  I would take solace in my outs.  Hey, when you were walking to the plate, did the pitcher turn around and give the sign of everyone moving?  Everyone, come on in.  Yeah.  Move in, everyone.  No, closer.  Closer.  The umpire would do that.  The fucking, they would actually pick the fences up and move them in.  Center fielder's now playing second base when Jimmy's up.  That was awful.  I told you the time that I fucking, I was up at the plate and I hit a little dribble or foul up the first baseline.  And it was just foul.  And I stood there limply. 
[00:48:00]  And they're all yelling, run, run it out.  And I was like, but the ball's foul.  Run it out.  And I just stood there.  And then it went fair.  Oh, no.  And as the guy picked it up, I started running and I got three feet.  I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got three feet from home plate.  Oh, hold on a second.  Let me just get the phone here because, you know, people who don't know me.  Are you the worst?  Yeah, I, uh.  That is funny.  I got three feet away from home plate and they threw me out and I had to turn around and walk back to the dugout. 
[00:48:30]  Old chubby, my fucking uniform was untucked.  Would you have made it if you started running right when you hit?  Oh, I might have.  Yeah.  If I just, yeah.  Yeah, if you actually did what you were supposed to do.  Or I would have at least looked like I was running it out.  But I stood there limply while they all screamed, run, run it out.  No, no, it's foul.  And I just stood there like with my arms out like, what?  I don't want to run it out.  It's a foul ball.  A little panicky Pete when it takes that turn.  And it hit the grass and it went right back in.  And as the guy picked it up, I just started hustling it out like the miracle was going to come. 
[00:49:00]  You hit a frunkus.  The ball went frunkus.  Oh, what an ass.  God, that's funny.  I remember one game.  I was so bad.  They moved me from position to position.  I started out in right field and they moved me in a third bag.  Oh, I was awful.  And some kid tried to steal third and they threw it to me.  And the ball just like, my glove stood there.  And the ball just went left of my glove and he ran home.  Oh, what a fucking impotent mess I was. 
[00:49:30]  There are certain people that you know, wherever they are positioned, the second he has to come  into play.  It's like, because it's happening so fast, but your mind is working real quick and you're  like, oh, we're fucked.  Oh, we're fucked.  And there goes the ball to throw and he fucking missed it.  And one year, I actually wasn't the worst hitter.  I would do okay.  And this is probably, what am I?  I mean, I'm 38 and this was probably when I was 13, 25 years ago.  And I still remember my dad overheard some black kid on the team complimenting me and 
[00:50:00]  he told me about it.  The kid's name was Andy Blocker.  Andy Blocker.  And he said that Jimmy's one of the better hitters on this team.  And my dad reported that to me and I never forgot it.  Nice.  I was one of the better hitters on that team.  Hey, uh.  And I wasn't.  Very nice of that.  Yes, it was me and Rick Allen and Christopher Reeve were the three hitters and I was one  of the better ones behind only those two.  I want to start a new bit.  Clean up hitter.  You got to clean up Christopher Reeve's shit.  And Heather Mills, where she would just put pine tar on her thigh and swing it. 
[00:50:30]  Oh my God.  I don't know why that makes sense.  She only has one leg.  That makes more sense if you have two.  Mike and Jersey Mike.  Asshole I am.  Mike.  Hey, what's up guys?  Hey.  Hey.  First at bat peewee.  Like the first year you could play baseball.  Hit right in the head by a pitch.  I must have stood a foot and a half away from the plate every time I went to bat after that.  I could not get into it after that.  Scared you away.  All right.  Hey.  Yeah, I never liked that being brushed back shit. 
[00:51:00]  It's the Iceman, Chuck Liddell, UFC light heavyweight champ.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Time for the Power Shift Minute.  The latest from the world of motorsports.  Here's Joe Costello.  After the 2007 season is complete, Anheuser-Busch, the current sponsor for NASCAR's Bush series,  will no longer be the title sponsor of NASCAR's second series, according to a report in Street & Smith's Sports Business Journal.  The Journal cites sources in the industry who say the new deal could be $30 million a year or about three times what Bush is paying. 
[00:51:30]  Subway, Walmart, and Samsung are all expected to make strong plays for the deal, according to the Journal.  Anheuser-Busch vice president of global media and sports marketing, Tony Punturo told the Journal that Bush's withdrawal will allow the brand to spread out its marketing dollars as opposed to investing all of its money into NASCAR.  For more motorsports news, turn into Power Shift with Joe Costello.

XM satellite, Welcome to the Church Radio Show.  I'm out here in ATL right now.  I'm going to dedicate this next record to my friends.  Previewing cuts and welcoming friends to XM.  Now we're going to go to Jamaica and make some rude boy noise one time.  Top selector, Big Snoop, D-O-W-J.  Direct from LABC.  Big Snoop, D-O-Dub.  Welcome to the Big Snoop Dogg Radio Show.

Live performances and a rare and intimate peek behind the curtain with the Dixie Chicks on Artist Confidential. 
[00:55:00]  Wide open space.  Here at this Tuesday night at 9 Eastern on Highway 16.  Opie and Anthony.  And now, the worst.  Black of Opie and Anthony.  This show sucks.  This awful.  Nice.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  He's dancing.  Yes, I am. 
[00:55:30]  I'm good.  Let me dance, too.  Oh.  He's dancing.  I don't think I'm going to dance.  Opie dances like the father in fame when he parks the cab with two arms going up.  That's my son!  Playing Bruno Martelli.  Easy.  Opie's actually danced in public.  What are you talking about?  You've danced at, like, clubs.  What are you talking about?  When you go out, you have a little too many, maybe.  I don't dance in clubs.  Even as a joke.  Do you hear what you're saying? 
[00:56:00]  Even as a joke.  I don't even go to clubs.  But you've done it.  Not a dance club.  A bar, let's say.  A song will come on, and you'll start doing your little dance.  Opie's a raver.  Well, that's a lot different than going, I go to clubs and dance, you ass.  Is it a club?  Now the Photoshop's are going to start going nuts.  They're going to have me as freaking John Travolta.  Tony Manero.  Go to opieandanthony.com to get to all our fan sites, by the way.  You didn't call me, Opie.  No, I'll do a little bounce thing from the side at a regular bar, you ass. 
[00:56:30]  That's what I'm talking about.  You're dancing at a club.  You said I go to clubs and dance.  It's a club, but you're dancing a little.  That's all I'm saying.  That's what you do.  You do that little back thing.  The little backwards thing.  You actually do moves.  No, I raise my hands in the air like I just don't care.  You do like a move, though.  It's not different every time.  So you have a dance, and it's at a club.  I do a little bounce.  A little bounce.  But it's not at a club.  No, there's hands are involved.  If you just did a bounce, that's one thing. 
[00:57:00]  But hands are involved.  Kenny's seen it.  Kenny knows.  Kenny, can you do it?  Are you crazy?  You guys are crazy.  I am not crazy.  Watch Jimmy.  Jimmy's got a dance.  Jimmy's got a dance.  There it is.  I don't do that.  That's the dance.  That's what we call the Opie dance.  I don't do that, you hooker-loving ass.  It's almost a Davy Jones skate with something else thrown in I can't quite figure out.  Ben.  Ben.  With a little bit of Ben Sparks twitch.  You guys have lost your mind.  Do the Ben. 
[00:57:30]  I do a little bounce.  Do the Ben.  I do a little bounce because I'm feeling the rhythm.  Next thing you know, I'm dancing in clubs.  Are you insane?  I meant out in public.  Do you know what that entails?  I meant out in public at a bar.  When a song comes on the jukebox, you'll do that move.  For 10 seconds.  It's long enough.  Maybe.  What I was getting to was the point that I don't dance.  Not at weddings, not at anything.  And the fact that you should be proud that you're that open.  I don't dance! 
[00:58:00]  You do.  How come everyone can do it then?  I don't know.  Ben.  Ben's doing it.  You guys had a secret meeting before I got here.  It's obvious.  No, he didn't.  Time to throw Opie under the bus.  No.  Again.  You dance.  It's all right.  They're all dancing.  Secret meetings going on.  I'm convinced of it.  Secret room.  No, it came up.  Secret room with secret meetings.  Okay.  I'll explain.  You don't have to.  It's cool.  The clubs.  Let them think what they want. 
[00:58:30]  You were going down to the disco.  Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch.  Ellen's got nothing on Opie.  Oh, no.  What did I do to you, Cigars and Scotch?  Does that make them dancing on in the beginning of the show?  I've done nothing but support you, my friend.  And you throw them under a bus.  Billy and Jersey, what's up?  Didn't I see you doing the electric slide at FH Riley's?  See you later, Bert.  Can I be here?  Of course, I will take advantage of that.  FH Riley's is the fine restaurant I own with my brothers in Huntington, 400 New York Avenue 
[00:59:00]  in Huntington Village.  And no, I do not do the electric slide at that fine establishment.  Perhaps after a couple of glasses of wine or something, maybe you get to see Opie do his moves.  Karaoke, right?  Now everyone's going to be looking at me to see if I do a little thing.  I've seen you do it at FH Riley's.  I've seen you leaning against the wall.  Do the little back.  It's like the shoulders kind of roll back. 
[00:59:30]  You know, it's kind of like a little relaxed shoulder roll.  Yeah, I think this was one of the songs.  It's the only time I feel like someone when I'm dancing, dancing down at the disco.  Opie gets in the car with a double J.  Annette, cigarette.  What the F? 
[01:00:00]  I've just seen you do the moves, even at FH Riley's.  You were leaning against the wall one day.  And a song came on.  And you just, like, you put on the face.  And you got the arms going.  And I'm like, yeah, Opie's feeling it.  He's feeling the groove.  I do a little bounce.  But there are arms.  Bounce is like you're making it sound like you're river dancing.  Ben just actually handed me a funny note.  No way.  Opie goes raving at crowbar with glow sticks. 
[01:00:30]  Well, Bert and Philly, the Opie dance is your chance.  Do the Opie.  Do the Opie.  The Opie.  Do the Opie.  Opie.  We've just all seen it.  That's all.  Yeah, yeah, great.  Great, great.  Hey, back's going to be a bitch.  Trust me.  I'm not saying anything that just we all haven't seen.  It's the move.  Opie dance.  There's nothing wrong with this.  We all have our own little things.  Nothing. 
[01:01:00]  Everyone gets a little chuckle out of it.  It's funny.  Opie, we know you're not seriously, you know, dancing.  I could be on the next episode of So You Think You Can Dance.  This is inside probably, but we don't feel like explaining everything on this show.  Bert and Philly, this weekend at FH Riley's.  No filter, Paul.  To Opie.  Why don't you call me, Opie?  Call me.  I hope it ends the same way with him plummeting from a bridge.  That stupid Lego person wig flying off his head. 
[01:01:30]  Big platform shoes.  Walking down the sidewalk crying.  That's what I want to see.  No filter, Paul.  Dressed in white 70s clothing with platform shoes.  Big platform shoes and gold chains.  White platform shoes.  Perhaps an Elvis cape.  Let's say hi to Chris in West Point.  Chris.  Yeah, he was looking like Buffalo Bill dancing.  James Gum. 
[01:02:00]  Did I say James?  James, of course I did.  James.  Yeah, yeah, James.  James Gum.  But there is a fine little dance sequence in the new Clerks 2 movie that made me laugh out loud.  What did you?  Let's go to Dan in Boston.  Dan, what's up?  Oh, oh, oh.  Sorry.  I got to do the thing here.  Touching his own nipple with his stupid, dirty mechanic fingernails.  She's a great big fat person.  Oh, Mrs. Littman.  Mrs. Littman.  I think I got a card inside. 
[01:02:30]  You want to go inside?  Jack Gordon.  You need help with that?  Would you?  Thank you.  Greatest character ever.  Oh, what a doll he was.  Dan, hold on one second.  Tony from a lake in New Jersey I cannot pronounce.  Ronkonkoma?  No, no, Lake.  Hoppatakon.  Lakeopakon.  Lakeopakon.  Lakeopakon.  Lakeopakon.  I don't know.  It starts with an H.  H-O-P-A-T-C-O-N-G.  Hoppatakon.  Hoppatakon.  Lakeopakon. 
[01:03:00]  Oh.  Stinks.  Another Indian name.  Exactly.  The Indians got screwed.  We took their land and then just named things after them.  It's Lake, ten bucks, now beat it.  Right.  Take these anthrax blankets with you.  Exactly.  Keep you warm.  Lake, here's a bead.  Tell your story walking, fella.  Tony's on to something.  Opie can't dance because his wallet keeps him off balance.  That's all you're seeing.  That's all you're really seeing there is me just trying to keep everything balanced. 
[01:03:30]  What I should do is start carrying two wallets in my back pocket.  Right.  Dan in Boston, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I got an old WAF Real Rock TV tape in it.  Opie and Anthony at a WAF event and Opie's dancing in the background to one of the songs.  He looked like a total jackass.  Wow.  Classic.  You don't have that.  Yeah.  You had Billy Idol in the studio doing an orgasm or having some girl do an orgasm for him.  Right.  And then you guys were at the Bayside Expo Center and Opie was doing like a skateboard 
[01:04:00]  thing, but it wasn't really him skateboarding.  Oh, I remember that bit.  That was funny.  It was me.  It was you.  It was Opie right at the lip of a half pipe.  Shut up.  It was me the whole time.  And he'd like jump off.  And then he switched clothes with this kid who was really good, and he's got a hood pulled  up over his head, and he's doing some rad moves on this half pipe.  And then he comes flying up, and of course, it cuts back to Opie going, ha, yeah, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, but when it cuts back to me, I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the half pipe.  Yeah.  You know?  And I fell on my ass and pretty much messed up my back pretty bad.  I couldn't even do that part of the bit.  There was no real skateboarding in that without dying.  I want a copy of that video.  What gave it away is your shoes changed.  Oh, there's a whole series.  My shoes changed?  Yeah, when it panned to the guy going down the half pipe, it was a different colored shoe.  Continuity error. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  All right, boys.  You rock.  All right, Dan.  Send that tape in if you have it.  We'll throw it up on the website.  What the hell?  I'd love to see some of that old Real Rock TV stuff.  I got all of them.  I got all of them.  Do you?  I got every episode.  Are you kidding?  I save everything.  Okay, one day you're going to have to let me borrow them so I can put them on DVD.  Invite me to your house and I'll bring them over.  You're cordially invited.  This Sunday.  Sunday?  I got plans. 
[01:05:30]  Saturday?  I got plans.  Tony, you don't call me.  No, I'll call you.  They're on VHS.  I got to switch them over before they run out.  They rot.  They're going to run out of VHS machines soon.  I got that.  I got this.  I got that.  Oh!  O-O-B and Anthony.  Oh, nay, fuck, yeah.  On your radio, let's start your motherfucking day. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, nay, fuck, yeah.  XM is the only way.  In radio, your game is true.  Because now you'll have to answer to.  Oh, nay, fuck, yeah.  So she don't in the chest and tickle my ma's only.  Fuck, yeah.  On XM 202, so fuck you.  Today they're on the air.  But they might not be tomorrow.  Fuck, yeah.

Fuck, yeah.  XM.  Fuck, yeah.  Escalade.  Fuck, yeah.  Mousetrap.  Fuck, yeah.  Macy cake.  Fuck, yeah.  No hole.  Fuck, yeah.  Skunks up.  Fuck, yeah.  Minus rock.  Fuck, yeah.  E-low.  Fuck, yeah.  Jaymore.  Fuck, yeah.  Rambo.  Fuck, yeah.  Raison.  Fuck, yeah.  Saturday.  Fuck, yeah.  Publicly.  Fuck, yeah.  J-K.  Fuck, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Keith, what do we got today?  We're also trying out homeless guys for the homeless shopping spree.  That's, what?  What are we up to?  A little over two and a half weeks away, something like that?  Yeah, about two and a half weeks away.  And I ran into John the other day outside Starbucks on 47th Street.  Yeah.  And figured he would be a good contestant. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, what's up, John?  I don't know yet.  Don't know yet?  Too early, huh?  Yeah, not enough Budweiser.  Ah.  Notice a lot of homeless guys like drinking.  Oh, sure.  Notice that.  Not surprised.  Yeah, but.  You know.  Got to kind of, what else are you going to do all day, right?  I got to get that kick.  I got to get that kick.  Yeah?  So you just, like, drink beer all day?  No, I drink about four.  Four?  Then I play all day.  And then you play. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  So you loosen up with a few beers, and then you play, and what do you put a little case  out or something like that, or a hat or something?  No.  No, you're not playing for cash, you're just playing for the fun of it.  Well, how does your guitar not get stolen?  I sleep on it.  Ah, good.  That's got to be good for it.  There you go.  That's got to be good for your back.  The Fender Posturepedic.  Yeah, no kidding.  If you can tell that, you know, if I'm really messed up, I'm laying out there on top of  it, but if I'm not messed up, just sleeping, then it's on top of me. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, so you know, has anyone ever tried to grab it, take off?  Three of them.  Three?  Three guitars.  I've been stuck.  Eddie Van Houseless. 
[01:09:30]  Paranoid.  Paranoid.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  What happened?  That isn't, whatever you did, it wasn't good.  Looks like he's electrocuting himself.  He's got a short in it.  You got a short?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I hate when that happens.  It's an old guitar, man.  Oh, he's in. 
[01:10:00]  I want him to do this with the guitar for the homeless shopping spree.  He's the greatest.  Yeah.  He can entertain the rest of the people there.  Sure.  At the mall.  And then Gray Wolf could do a little something.  It'll be wonderful.  All right.  What's going on?  What's going on, Keith?  It's a battery.  It's a battery?  All right.  We'll get back to homeless guitar dude in a second. 
[01:10:30]  Army of anyone we got to.  Yeah, let's get Army of anyone in here, man.  They've been waiting around watching this.  Yeah.  I think we've got something here.  Hey, that feedback is killing my ears. 
[01:11:00]  I can't even wear my headphones.  You are Eric Crapton.  You need a manager?  Master Cole, man.  You can manage him.  Yeah, you should manage him.  You can put him on the road.  Wait, I think he might be ready to sing.  Don't throw up for me, man.  I'm telling you.  I'm not vomiting on you, man. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  That's the end of that shit.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, here we go.  All right.  It's back.  Crap.  I can listen to this for another hour.  His five-year-old threw himself out the window.  The battery. 
[01:12:00]  He can't stop fucking with everything.  He fucks with everything.  It's just turning the car off.  Yeah.  Oh, is he great?  What happened?  You are good.  Wait, what happened?  He smells.  He's Angus Dunn.  We got to get him sick of double-A batteries.  Double-A.  This is double-A.  Yeah, that's what my wife used to have.  Chuck buried in a week.  This is not right. 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  It's a dark day in rock and roll, man.  Dark day.  Oh.  It's a dark day.  Who cares?  Who cares?  He's messing with his stuff.  Look.  That's his rig.  That's his rig.  It's the only thing I've got.  Do you sing, too?  No.  I leave that up to the singer.  The singer don't play guitar, and I don't sing. 
[01:13:00]  You ain't playing guitar, either.  The battery's red now, brother.  The feedback is really amazing.  There he goes.  Now he's ready.  All right.  Now he's ready.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rock.  Hey, I'm going to sing.  Oh.  I'm going to sing.  Okay.  Where's your wah-wah?  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Where's the wah-wah?  Oh, it crapped out again. 
[01:13:30]  This is so fucking funny.  Is that good equipment?  Yeah, but the battery's working.  Hey, did we do George Thoroughbed?  I want to get a drink.  That's me sick.  I can't take that.  I want to make some proof.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Jimmy, horrendous.  I want to get a drink.  That's Lenny Crab shit. 
[01:14:00]  That's the guitar solo from Beat It.  Yes, please.  There he goes.  He's trying to push another button.  So...  Dig, if you will, the picture.  What is...  The view in my game.  What is he playing?  I don't know.  That's Purple Rain.  Oh, is it?  With a dump squad.  Oh, yeah.  With a dump squad.  Britt.  Richie Sam Boring.  Jimmy Plague. 
[01:14:30]  There we go.  God damn it.  Come on.  Thank God.  Right here.  For the Allison Chains fans out there, Jerry can't play.  From Brian and Foster.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  The batteries.  It's not the battery.  I think you got a short circuit.  Yeah, what's up?  Now it's a point when the batteries are dead.  Yeah.  It shuts on and off.  Well, how about someone go get some batteries?  Hey, didn't you charge up for the big gig today? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  This is the big gig, man.  This is the big time.  You got record people listening and everything.  This is what you've been waiting for.  Quincy Jones.  Quincy Jones, my son.  And this guitar don't help.  It's been through the road rush like me, man.  I think we might have another one of those Jäger Micey guitars around, too.  Is there a Jäger guitar laying around?  See if we can get him a better guitar and a battery, and we'll see what he can really do.  What kind of batteries?  How many batteries do you need?  Six double A.  Wow.  Six double A.  A whole maglite full over his head. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  He's running again.  There we go.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, now he's rocking.  Okay.  Now I understand.  You know, you know what's so sad?  Like, without the alcohol, he's probably, like, the greatest. 
[01:16:00]  No, he's going to take it like the greatest.  That's got to be the spirit of Jimi Hendrix in him.  Spike from Chicago wants to nickname him ZZ Stop.  He's going to take it like the best.  Oh, man.  This is getting ready to get heavy. 
[01:16:30]  Now we've got a new guitar coming out and a battery.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Must apologize to the listening audience with these sounds.  It's been a good day for music.  Yeah, great day for music.  Steve from Albany for all the Rush fans out there.  Alex Waste of Lifeson.  Snapman from Wack Bag.  Stevie Ray Yawn.  Well, she went.  Oh, he's singing.  Uh-oh.  He's going to sing. 
[01:17:00]  Flying out and out and doing.  With a shady motorboat.  Back to the road.  To a fine post-dress.  With a mystery motorboat.  And the titty is playing victory.  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  The squealing.  What was it?  That was the what?  That's the sound of one hand clapping.  He's shaking badly.  What's with that squeak? 
[01:17:30]  Does he have Parkinson's?  I don't know.  Why are you shaking, sir?  Oh, I'm ready to rip it.  Do you have Parkinson's?  No.  I'm mad at this stuff, man.  I've got to start creaming it.  All right.  You really want to love it?  What a fine time.  What's up, Lucille?  Oh, I'm like this jack of my life and my friend.  I've had some good luck time.  That's what you did.  I'm so alone here. 
[01:18:00]  Take a piece of my time.  The butt fuck.  Lucille.  It's the butt fuck song?  I don't think that's going to take off like a...  Wait.  We've got to hear his vocals, man.  Yeah.  Back way off on the guitar mic.  That's the butt fuck song.  Pull the guitar mic away.  I can't read it, Charlie.  It's really good.  Yeah.  Pull the guitar mic away.  Yeah.  We don't really...  Yeah.  There. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Believe me.  It picks up.  And then, so we can hear him sing.  All right.  Let's hear you sing there.  Sing a little.  All right.  Sing a little song.  Sing...  Do the butt fuck song.  Are you listening to me?  I love Lenny Kravitz, man.  Lenny Kravitz kicked butt.  And you mentioned...  You just hit him in the hand.  You mentioned it today.  Rockefeller and all that, what a today show is. 
[01:19:00]  That's where I got my blanket and everything.  Right across the way, I saw Lenny Kravitz.  Oh, you did?  He kicks butt like a mother.  Yeah.  You know a little Lenny?  Can you sing it?  Can you sing and play a little?  I can't sing anything.  Well, you sang the butt fuck song.  Sing that again.  That was pretty good.  What?  Which one?  Who?  You were just singing just about a minute ago.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  What happened here?  Crank it up.  What's wrong with your equipment?  I turned it off.  Oh, you're sweet.  This guitar has got a short in it.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Wow.  From Jimbo from North Carolina.  Johnny needs cash.  Come on.  Lift it up.  Where's Mark?  Mark David Chapman when you need him.  Johnny needs cash.  Yeah, see?  The inside wiring.  Hey, you ever been in a band?  How many bands have you been in?  Well, we got Ace from Houston.  This guy's name is Johnny.  Please die this winter. 
[01:20:00]  Are you finished?  Derek in Ohio.  Lenny craps his pants.  See, it's out of tune, man.  This thing gets out of tune.  All right.  Let's go.  Here we go.  You're back in tune.  This one goes out to the one I fuck. 
[01:20:30]  This one goes out to the one I left her behind.  Oh, I forgot that one.  Ain't that a mercy mess?  Just right back from scratch. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, it's the mess part.  Someone from their cell phone, Tommy, out of tune.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Neil Old.  All those sales.  Get the shit out of me.  Neil Mulder.  You went with Neil Old?  Neil Old.  Yeah.  See?  Six double-A batteries. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, that's good stuff.  For the REM fans, Josh's jersey.  Peter needs a buck.  Ha, ha, ha.  We can hear this.  We couldn't hear a fucking, you know, filter.  Where's Lucille?  What's happening? 
[01:22:00]  Homeless guitar dude.  What's happening?  Own up with the only heart that he was just playing.  What's happening?  Sound like own up and own up.  Batteries.  Oh, damn batteries again.  Why can't we get him batteries?  Drunk guitar dude and a six double-A.  Who's on their way out?  Is someone getting him batteries?  Oh, yeah.  Batteries are on the way.  Okay.  They're en route.  Hate that when my equipment fails.  Yeah, I bet.  How do you think it feels about you?  What?  Remember the band when they were on?  Equipment failed.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, but they're millionaires. 
[01:22:30]  Happens to everyone.  Yeah, it happens to everyone.  That's the one common link.  You have a common link with that band.  The failure of equipment.  Their equipment failed and yours is trying to kill itself.  And your liver is failing.  That's something in common.  What's your name, homeless dude?  What are your name?  They call me Popper Rock.  Oh, Popper Rock.  Popper Rock.  That makes sense.  Because he's an older gentleman and he rocks.  Yeah.  He actually sleeps on.  He's 23 years old. 
[01:23:00]  It's a tough old life out there on the street.  This could be.  Arguably.  This guitar is fresh, man.  The worst guitar playing.  I'm mesmerized.  I've ever heard in my life.  Wow, dang.  I'll get tuberculosis from this.  Sam.  Title of this video.  I'll get tuberculosis from this.  Worst guitarist ever.  Wow, dang.  I'm telling you right now.  There you go.  You're making my heart stink. 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  Might as well join the rest of you.  You're making everything.  I could throw up in the seat.  Fiatch.  Yeah.  Nice lead.  But we won't get fooled again.  Ah.  How old, how old, how old, how old the gentleman are you, sir? 
[01:24:00]  Fifty-four.  Don't call me, sir.  Oh, don't call you, sir?  No, I'm homeless for a living.  Hey, that was a good one.  Just being respectful.  You want a warm-up for Tracy Morgan at Caroline's this weekend?  I love you, people.  All right, what's that?  I got my wow, uh, my wow-y-dally. 
[01:24:30]  A wow, your wow sticker, yeah.  How could a guitar sound like it has moving parts that aren't oil?  What's up with the guitar?  What's up?  It just got mad.  Yeah.  I bet.  Hanging right next to your cock-old thing.  Dude, you might be getting electrocuted.  On.  What's that noise?  Oh, my God.  And he's back.  That's the turbo spinning on the wheel.  The wheel to power it. 
[01:25:00]  It sounds like Chong when he was playing guitar in the next movie.  Oh, yeah.  When I try to change it, you know the battery's out.  Oh, change the settings.  Don't electrocute yourself, brother.  No, please do.  It's batteries, man.  What's the matter with you?  I hope to see him tasered by his own equipment.  Man, what's the matter with you?  Yeah, what is the matter with you?  He's well aware, man.  Do you think all that feedback is from batteries?  That is from...  That amp has been through hell. 
[01:25:30]  That was paranoid.  Yeah, right up until...  All right, what happened?  It ended.  The batteries.  Yeah, batteries again.  And we go again.  This guitar is homeless.  It never works. 
[01:26:00]  Got it?  See?  He's shaking like crazy.  You think it's got the...  I don't know if Park is in his...  Park is home.  Park is home.  Maybe he's just keeping in step with the beat.  Yeah, my batteries are out.  I've been cranking down.  We're not changing batteries.  Great.  Boy, we are...  I've changed batteries more than I've changed underwear. 
[01:26:30]  I really...  We are pissing off.  You have underwear on?  No, they're not really, man.  Wait.  You wear underwear?  Hold on.  Steve, I'm on the ground.  Steve.  He's hitting that wall now.  He's hitting that wall.  He's about to take a tune.  Adam Kent.  Adam Kent.  Adam Kent.  All right, let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, can you guys tell Roger I wish you drowned in the Hudson waters to shut up?  Roger.  Are they enjoying it on Paltalk? 
[01:27:00]  Well, they're trying to come up with new names.  Okay.  I like this.  I think it sounds great.  Skidmark, Rowe.  I'm tapping out.  I've about had it with him. 
[01:27:30]  Wait, wait.  He's got...  This is his last song.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Bachman Turner overdrank.  Brian Mayhem Edge.  All right. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, I've had it.  By the way, when do we send somebody for batteries?  Oh, my God.  He's got a boop, Bob.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:28:30]  Get it off of that.  Leonard's skin disease.  Yeah, that's about right.  All right.  Well, we got a break.  I got a push.  Yeah, homeless guitar, dude.  Very good.  Might as well just do it in here and freshen up the air.  Very good.  He's a keeper?  Oh, he's a keeper, all right.  Yeah, he's going to go.  He's going to go.  Yeah.  We got another homeless guy for the homeless shopping spree.  Homeless guitar, dude.  Joins. 
[01:29:00]  Hobo stank.  Hobo stank.  Oh, is that a good one?  Very funny.  Iggy poop.  Very funny.  Hobo stank.  People are also commenting how their cats and dogs are running around the house like traumatized  from this sound.  Hey, homeless guitar, dude.  Hobo stank.  Paparot.  Paparot.  Paparot.

It's seen a lot with me.  It's dead, right?  It's seen a lot of action.  That's a good guitar.  Boom.  Seen a lot of action, huh?  Yeah.  Out there in the trenches.  That's all he has.  I'm really ashamed of my situation.  Oh, don't be, sir.  Well, I could cheer you up with it, too.  You're what?  I'm a Vietnam vet.  Been there, done that.  Are you?  And now I get out here and I'm... 
[01:32:30]  The war is over, but my battle still...  Oh, Jesus.  Well, I know a happy song I could play for you.  What were you in, my friend?  What branch of the service?  Navy.  Navy?  Yeah.  So you're off there...  I was proud to serve my country.  Yeah?  What year is we in the service?  But I'm still...  Huh?  What year is we in the service?  June 16th to September 11th.  What year?  Same day of the attacks.  In the Navy? 
[01:33:00]  How'd you know?  I just was, you know...  You look like a Navy guy.  You look like a Navy guy.  You look like a Navy guy.  I was part of a clean-up crew.  Vietnam?  What clean-up crew?  We had an eight-man team.  Eight-man team?  We'd go out at night when we bombarded the place with rockets and all that.  You know, bunkers and all that, man.  Uh-huh.  But you were in the arms of Mekong Delta.  Like the Navy SEALs.  Like the Navy SEALs, the Mekong Delta.  He was in the Navy for three months?  Yeah, the Dragon of Nine Fingers.  Right.  Then we got off in the gunboat. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  Well, not the gunboat helicopter.  No, the little...  A little...  A little...  A little...  Yeah, yeah.  That type thing.  A little Zodiac.  Boom, boom.  And then you'd take that out and then you'd hit the beaches or you'd hit the river.  The river.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you'd go up the Mekong Delta into the rice paddies and chop off some gook ears.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good old days, right?  Even the kids would come up to you with a backpack full of bombs.  You got to shoot them.  Never hug the kids.  Never pick up anything. 
[01:34:00]  No, no.  Never hug the kids.  Don't even go to the bathroom when they're in there, I say.  What years were you in the Navy?  Yeah, what years were you in the Navy?  In Vietnam.  How old were you in the Navy?  69 to 70.  Did you get shot at?  Yeah.  Yeah, a couple times.  I took three tours.  Three tours?  After the tour, they pulled everybody out.  Wait, 69 to 70, you took three tours in a year?  Wow.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We practically lived there.  What was your...  Three-core and four-core.  How long was each tour?  About two years?  No.  Oh, how long?  This was six months.  Quick tours. 
[01:34:30]  Quick tours.  I mean, they were bombarding.  I was on Rocket Launcher No. 3.  No. 3?  Rocket Launcher No. 7.  And I was a popcorn popper.  Popcorn popper.  My uncle was on No. 6, did you know?  Yeah, the .50 Cal or a machine gun.  Yeah, the .50 Cal.  I was on the USS White River.  The USS White River.  Yeah, a flat-bottom boat.  Built to go down the canals.  Oh, yeah?  After bombardment, we'd go out at night and anchor and then put down the raft, right? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  And then we'd go, boom, boom.  Tiger, man.  Everybody wearing all black.  Fucking tigers.  Eight men.  Eight men teams, man.  It was so disgraceful.  Yeah, I want to play that guitar.  Hey, Opie, give me a favor.  What?  Play this sucker.  Yeah?  Oh, wow.  He's asking for it now.  Yeah, you're going to play this sucker.  He is asking for it.  Oh, no.  Yeah?  That's asking for it.  You're all me?  Playing your guitar?  I'd be honored, sir.  Talking about malfunctions.  Yeah.  I know how to play guitar. 
[01:35:30]  This is going to malfunction.  Thanks, kid.  Because when you get a hold of a good guitarist, when you get a hold of a good guitarist like  Opie, everything malfunctions.  I'm into Nirvana and I'm into the Who.  I like the Who a lot.  You like the Who?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Roger Daltrey and the rest of them.  God, does Fabio on line four have a good one?  And I like...  Hey, Fabio.  Stone Temple Pilots.  Yo. 
[01:36:00]  What's up?  What do you got to bust on Eddie Panhandling's guitar for?  Eddie Panhandling.  All right.  Why don't you play a little something?  I like that.  Play a little something.  Play a little something and then I'm going to play a little something.  You don't feel like playing?  Why?  What's wrong, sir?  What happened?  This is garbage.  I don't like playing in garbage.  No, it's not garbage.  Nah.  I can show you where I can show you.  Opie could...  Okay, Opie.  He knows a little...  I believe he does.  Plays the guitar.  A little bit. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  Opie plays the guitar.  See what you can do with his thing, man.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Let me strap in here.  It's Thanksgiving tomorrow.  Yeah, it is, isn't it?  Boy, okay.  All he has, don't do it.  Just, just...  Two hairs cut.  All right, turn me on.  All right.  Are you ready?  Hold on.  Yeah.  That's good.  I like that.  Play a little national anthem like Jimi Hendrix. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Do it again.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  They're jamming.  That's cool.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, my God.  He's helping them.  The guy's reaching around and helping Opie.  He's teaching them.  Hey, do you know any, uh...  You know any who?  Like Pete Townsend?  What was Pete Townsend famous for?  Crappy guitar. 
[01:37:30]  You play it first.  Show me something first.  Show me something.  Why are we doing this?  This is going to be awful.  Yes, I know.  I'm not going to be able to look.  I can't look.  I'm looking to my hands.  I'm looking away.  The man is being so sweet.  He's helping Opie play.  He's teaching him a tune.  And he's a make-believe veteran.  He's a fake veteran.  I don't know if he is or not.  Oh, stop it.  Rocket Launcher number three.  He's fucking crazy.  He toured in Vietnam in 88.  That's a pic from Papa Rock.  Oh, wow.  That's what I got.  The sticker.  Wow. 
[01:38:00]  He used it to clean his teeth.  I'm going to put it on my guitar.  All right.  Uh-oh.  I got the culprit, didn't I? 
[01:38:30]  Well, what a fine time you...  Oh, no.  I like that, huh?  Oh, boy.  What?  I don't know how to play.  Can we take a break?  I got to take a break.  Yeah, me too.  All right.  Take a break or take a leak?  After the break, Opie's going to play a little tune.  Hey, this is Brian Regan, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony on XM.  Opie and Anthony.

[01:42:00]  which stands for Focus on Fundamentals.  Today's fundamentals are inventory and vendors.  Inventory is a euphemism for cash.  Find a way to convert into cash all inventory that is not turning.  Just in case inventory management is costing you cash,  If you haven't been practicing just-in-time inventory management, do it now.  Next, vendors and suppliers.  If your sales volume is off, so is theirs.  Ask them to help you manage inventory, maximize margins, lower freight costs, 
[01:42:30]  and develop new ways to support and serve your customers.  If a vendor isn't part of the solution, get rid of them.  Vendors are like buses.  A new one comes along every six minutes.  Write this on a rock.  For maximum success, focus on the fundamentals of inventory and vendors.  This is Jim Blassingame, the small business advocate.

It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's go to Ralph.  Ralph, what's up?  Did I get a bad review?  I don't know.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Uh, this guy, this guy who lives by the pizzeria on 48th Street, nice to work over there,  and after he has a few beers, he'll start just dropping the embalm right in front of  Black Ice, and a few times he had a feeling from getting his ass kicked, I think a couple 
[01:43:30]  guys tried to choke him out with his own bandana one time.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's bring him in again.  He likes, uh...  Homeless guitar dude!  Let's get him all around, though.  Keith found a winner, though, for the homeless shopping spree.  This guy's gonna be, uh, a star.  He's pretty smart, too.  He's fixed my friend's computer one day when he's sober.  Oh, really?  Why, does it need to be urinated on?  Yeah.  It went back.  It went back.  It went back.  My friend brings him home sometimes, and, like, you know, cleans him up a little bit.  Bucks him up the...  Oh, what? 
[01:44:00]  Cleans him up?  Yeah, because we work security across the street there, and, uh...  He's a guy who brings him home, and, you know, you know, whatever.  Let him hang out.  That's a nice guy.  And he actually fixed the guy's computer.  He's, you know, the Turk stock, so he's actually, you know...  He knows...  He knows about computers?  Yeah, he does.  But then when he gets drunk, he'll just call a lady a cunt as she's walking by.  That's great.  Wow.  Belligerent.  Nice.  You gotta give him, like, four, five, five, five, six.  Hey, uh, hi there, sir.  Oh, hit me Guinness now. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, Pop Rock.  That's good.  Hey, Pop Rock, you, uh, you know about computers?  Good Rock.  Oh, boy.  You fix computers?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Hey, that's cool.  Yeah?  What do you know about computers?  How to prepare them.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And what one of her...  Any program problems or anything like that?  You're able to, like...  I got a two-year degree, yeah.  You do?  Yeah?  Yeah.  See, the guy, uh...  Missouri...  Missouri Institute of Technology.  MIT you went to?  No, that's Massachusetts. 
[01:45:00]  Well, it's the same thing.  Starts with an M.  Just trying to help you out.  Make it sound like you went to MIT.  I don't fake anything.  No, huh?  Oh, hey.  Okay.  All right.  Not myself, man.  Do you like the N-word?  No.  No?  Why?  Like, uh, Kramer used it to...  I've used it before, but then...  Yeah.  ...  You know, when I started thinking.  I said, man, you don't do that.  No.  Just say...  Boom-boom?  Say coon.  I like white trash. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because we heard, uh...  You know, it's New York City.  A couple of people know you.  They see you hanging around.  A couple of people know you.  And they call up the show, and they say that occasionally, after a few wobbly pops...  Oh, man.  ...that you like to blurt out the N-word as black guys are walking by.  And a couple of times, a couple of them almost choked you out with your own bandana.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Yeah, that might happen.  What happened?  They were walking by.  What'd you say?  Did you just say, hey, nigger, or what? 
[01:46:00]  I can't say that.  You can.  We want to know what you have.  Let me put it this way.  I learned my lesson.  I learned my lesson.  What'd they do?  What'd they do?  They used to call me on it, and that's it.  I taught you a little lesson?  I used to call Mexicans wetbacks, stuff like that.  Used to.  Did the black guys hit you?  No, used to.  Yeah, one did.  But the Puerto Ricans come to my aid.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  Why?  That's nice.  They're like the police.  They like me.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  The Puerto Ricans?  Yeah.  And then occasionally...  I'm okay when I'm sober, you know?  That's what we're hearing.  Because I also heard that when women walk by sometimes, if you'd been drinking, you'll just  yell out, cunt.  No, I'd say, you want to fuck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two of them walked by me one time.  Uh-oh.  And I said, hey, you want to fuck?  And they kept walking.  Then they walked back.  Ah.  And they said, hey, she wants to take you up on that.  Uh-huh. 
[01:47:00]  And I said, I'm just kidding.  Get out of here.  Wow.  You know, it's like any other comedian, man.  Boom, boom.  Boom, boom.  Oh, that's terrific.  Yeah.  Okay, I think...  Wow.  So, obviously, your demeanor changes when you've been drinking.  Personality.  Everything.  Yeah.  Everything.  So, what did you say to the black guys?  You can tell us.  Yeah.  No, I don't like that.  I don't like it.  All right, but what did you say?  You don't have to like it, but what did you say?  It's not...  We can say it, you know, with you saying, you're just repeating what you said. 
[01:47:30]  It's an awful thing, and you don't do this anymore.  Right.  But just to, you know, get a little basis in fact here, what did you say back then?  We know it was wrong.  We know it was terrible, but what was it?  All right, there was a black dude laying there, and I was, like, on vodka.  Ah.  And that's a destroyer.  Mental note.  And I walked by, and he was laying there, you know, and... 
[01:48:00]  Pack, bust, vodka.  Boom, boom.  And I walked by, and I said,  that old nigga laying there.  Ah.  And he pulls my strap and everything, gets up.  I'm on my way over.  He pulls my strap and everything.  He bops you outside the head.  Hmm.  And the Puerto Rican messenger people, you know,  they come to my aid and everything, you know.  But I'm shaming myself for doing that. 
[01:48:30]  Ah.  That's no good, man.  I'm not a KKK or nothing like that, you know.  Yeah, that was a better apology than Kramer's on Letterman right there.  Yeah.  You know, it comes straight from the heart, baby, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now you're down with the brothers out there on the street?  I try to be.  Yeah.  In fact, I got several people at Rockefeller, you know.  We hang out and everything, boom, boom.  They help me out.  Isn't that ironic?  He lives in a place named after Rockefeller, one of the richest people. 
[01:49:00]  You know, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Now it's Tishman's Fire.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  But I hang out right across the street from Nintendo World and all, you know.  Yeah.  And my Rockefeller people, we got a lot of black people and we all get along.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, I changed my attitude.  I changed my drinking habits the whole bit.  I saw you went from Bud to Guinness.  Don't even laugh.  Yeah.  Why?  You got to laugh at that.  That's kind of funny.  Hey, I like both Bud and Guinness. 
[01:49:30]  All right, well.  You do?  Make a black and tan.  I like Sanhides.  What?  8.2% alcohol.  I like Sterno.  100%.  Well, I like hairspray.  How do you like that?  Oh, beat that.  Yeah?  Beat that.  You ever have to resort to maybe drinking a little hairspray or mouthwash?  No.  Stuff like that?  No.  Leave that for the Mexicans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dirty wetbacks.  Yeah.  Go to Gallup.  I live in Arizona. 
[01:50:00]  Boom, boom.  Oh, them and the, well, you can deal with the Mexicans and the Indians, right?  Don't even go there when they're drunk.  Right.  And when are they not?  Am I right or wrong?  At least I woke up sober.  Yeah, right?  Ah.  Okay?  They're drunk all the time.  Tell us a little about the Injins.  I can't.  Yeah?  They're all laying around.  They're all laying around.  That's it. 
[01:50:30]  And you can call them bad things and they're too lazy to stand up and hit you.  They're too drunk.  Too drunk.  Yeah, of course.  What are you saying?  Is that your Indian impression?  What do you think I said?  You want a rock?  Get the skull fracture on it.  And then what happened?  I don't know what he's doing.  They didn't have that.  You want a beer?  Yeah, that was all right.  Yeah.  That's all I put on.  Everything I do like that is just a put on.  Oh, of course. 
[01:51:00]  We know.  It's a goof.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jeff and Jerry.  You're kidding around, boom, boom.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, Opie, I got a request for you.  Can you play some Smashing Pumpkins?  Yeah, that sounds good.  All right.  Thank you.  Josh or John in Indiana.  Yeah, John.  Anthony, poor Jim, don't let Opie have the guitar.  Yeah, I'm starting to lean that way.  All right.  What are we going to do with Homeless Guitar, dude?  One more song before you get out of here? 
[01:51:30]  No, you've got to play.  Oh.  Well, you play first and then I play.  I can't play on this piece of garbage.  No, I can play.  Trust me.  I know that.  You don't like that?  You heard it a little, right?  I don't like that guitar.  I hate this.  Aw.  Well, just play a little something and then I'll play something.  That's fair.  Put down your Guinness for two seconds.  Yeah.  You can't.  Yeah, you can't.  Just chug it.  There you go.  Fucking chug it.  Make it all go away.  There you go.  There you go. 
[01:52:00]  There you go.  That's it.  Just the mother's milk.  There you go.  Yeah.  Feeling better, right?  Whoa.  Yeah.  Nice.  Good job.  I'll put McMahon, milkman to hell.  That's right.  I'll put him to shame and I like it.  All right.  That's not my game.  He's got to be on the home of the shopping spree.  Yeah, he will be.  Back up over there and play a little guitar and then I'm going to play.  Go back to where you are.  Give him a little room.  Oh, no.  Give him a little room. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, no.  What do you think?  You play, I play.  That's how it works.  You play, I play.  One last tune, John.  All right.  One last tune, Mr. Rock.  How about Lucille?  Yeah.  A rock classic.  Well, I want to tell you something, baby doll.  Uh-oh.  Okay, I want to tell you something.  I don't know.  He's got a little gay in him.  We all.  We all.  I've been married three times.  Yeah?  Not to men.  Dude, you're good, man. 
[01:53:00]  You've got to get on a stage and do some of that comedy.  I don't need to do that.  I need to play.  Sam, move him over.  Bruce Stinkstein.  Yeah, over there.  Here, push him over there.  Yeah, we're trying to get you on the stage so that...  Oh, this camera doesn't work, though.  Oh, that's...  Nah, I know.  Oh, I was trying to help out the pal talkers.  All right.  Homeless guitar, dude.  Whenever you're ready.  I don't know.  He's digging for a pick.  Oh, you want the one you gave me?  Nope.  Just pick that off the back of your neck and play with that. 
[01:53:30]  Huh?  I'm using toothpicks.  That's why they call it a pick.  You want this one?  Nope.  You sure?  Yeah.  Which one is that?  The one you gave me.  I gave him to him.  No.  Dude, you just touched your tooth with that pick.  Are you a crazy person?  I did.  I was picking my teeth for that.  I gave you a put in your mouth.  Just hold it in your mouth.  Give me a ten bucks.  Why did you do that?  Twenty.  Why did you do that?  Twenty.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing, homeless guitar dude? 
[01:54:00]  We got a radio show to do it.  We got record people listening.  I'm molesting my equipment.  What happened?  Batteries?  No.  Cable.  Yeah.  Cable this time.  I never can get decent equipment.  No.  No.  But it rains on us.  Yeah.  That helps it.  You're on 40.  Okay.  Come on.  All right.  There you go. 
[01:54:30]  Almost.  You almost had it right there.  Come on.  Wait for it.  There you go.  You're 54 years old, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're on 1952.  All right.  He's adjusting all his...  He's got all these, like, electronic boxes all over his...  Belt.  All right.  What's that?  What are you doing, sir?  He's just tuning his equipment.  Mm-hmm.  Why is it taking long? 
[01:55:00]  He was just doing it before.  All right.  Because he's a bum.  Oh, shit.  I forgot for a second.  What's happening?  Oh, boy.  It's not looking like it's going to happen, huh?  Cable.  Yeah.  Cable.  It's a cable network.  Cable network?  Might need a new cable, I'm thinking.  Would you mind doing me a favor?  What's that?  I was talking to this.  Oh, you're talking to the box.  Mind working?  Oh, I see.  You were talking to your equipment.  I'm sure you've heard that before. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, see?  I'm beyond fascinated by this guy.  Beyond.  He needs a breathe right strip.  Yeah.  Give him one, Jim.  I know.  The Louisville Slugger written out.  What?  What?  Yeah.  It's not working.  Is it the...  It's the amp.  Is it the amp?  Yeah.  The box with your pedals on it? 
[01:56:00]  No.  It's this one.  The cord?  The little thing.  The batteries?  The cable.  Or that guitar?  Or is it the retard holding it?  Between both of them, it's all of them.  Yeah.  You need a new cord, I think.  Jeez.  And sinuses.  Yeah, keep doing that.  Doing what?  Jiggling the...  Okay.  Christ.  We're in Vietnam, an Agent Orange catcher?  Jesus. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  You're breathing like you just ran a marathon.  Because I want to play.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  There we go.  Do you know a guy named Andrew?  No.  Out on the streets?  Like an Indian guy?  Hello.  How are you?  Goes to the church.  Should we be nice and plug him into the real amp? 
[01:57:00]  What real amp?  We have one?  Yeah.  He sucks, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's checking everything.  This is horrible.  For the 10th time, he's checking the exact same thing.  Yeah, there's three things.  The guitar, the amp, and that box of pedals that seems to fuck everything up when he touches it.  I got to get another amp.  Bypass.  You know what?  Here's what you do, my friend.  Take the cord out of the pedals.  I know how to work it.  And put it right into the amp.  And that way you'll see if it's the pedals that's the problem. 
[01:57:30]  And that cord.  Not the pedal, I can tell you.  You know how to work it, right?  You know how to work it.  You know how to work it.  Just tell me to go fuck myself.  I know.  But the thing is, the thing is, I'm afraid of getting shot because of the, it's got short in it and everything.  No, you won't get shocked.  How do you get shocked?  It's batteries.  You can get a little bit of voltage there, but you won't get enough amps to kill you.  Just enough to make us laugh.  I'd like to kill you with that amp.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  Now we're talking. 
[01:58:00]  Plugged into an amp.  A real amplifier.  Jam out, sweetie.  Boy, it's the cord, isn't it?  Stupid thing.  Is it the guitar?  I can't get a decent guitar.  No, huh?  There you go.  We're getting there.  Oh, boy.  That sounds.  See?  You got a short where?  In the guitar?  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Jiggle the cord.  Yeah.  It's not that.  It's this.  This pot.  Oh.  What happened?  It was working fine.  Yeah.  It was, but it gets boom, boom.  Opie, you know a little something about guitars, don't you?  No, not really.  I bet you could fix that.  I bet you could, too.  I bet you could make it.  I actually want you to fix it.  I bet Opie can make it so that that switch is no longer a problem at all.  I bet he can make it so that switch is inconsequential.  I actually am rooting for you to fix it. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  I can't believe I am, but I'd love you to fix it.  I really want you to fix that guitar.  I'd love you to give that guitar the fixing of its life.  Straighten it right out.  Yeah, this guy.  Bad switch, huh?  Bad cable.  Bad cable.  And guitar.  And the guitar.  When did you get that guitar, sir?  About a year and a half ago.  About a year and a half ago.  Where'd you get it?  Dumpster?  Sam Ash.  The dumpster is Sam Ash? 
[01:59:30]  No, where'd you get it?  Sam Ash?  Same thing.  And how much was it?  $75.  How'd you get $75?  The one I want is a B.C. Rich beast.  Oh, yeah.  B.C. Rich.  Know you with that.  Absolutely, man.  Guitar center.  From one guitar player to the other, man.  Guitar center.  There we go.  Here we go.  Rock and roll.  Getting ready for Thanksgiving.  Let's go, homeless guitar dude.  Play us out of here. 
[02:00:00]  Right with the pedals.  Jesus.  Enough with the fumbling with the pedals.  Oh, no.  He bypassed your pedals and went direct.  What'd you do?  You had it.  He needs the pedals.  He won't play without the pedals.  Sir, the pedals.  Oh, my God.  Would you forget the pedals for a minute? 
[02:00:30]  Fuck the pedals.  You had it.  Must have hated those pedals.  Jesus Christ, with the pedals.  Enough about the pedals.  This one.  Yeah.  Fumbling with everything incompetently.  Finally, he's ready to go.  He's just fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble.  I'll tell you one thing.  It was working.  Why don't you stop fiddling with it?  He's perfect for this radio show to work behind.  It was perfect.  Sir, it was fixed, and you just kept fiddling with it.  Fiddling.  It's not a fiddle.  I like this.  All right. 
[02:01:00]  There we go.  Just play it.  Here we go.  Wait, the pedals.  Sir, the pedals.  Oh, it cuts in and out because the chords.  Tuning is optional.  There is a house in New Orleans.  Oh, you know that one?  They call the rising sun.  There is a house, and I don't live in one. 
[02:01:30]  He's atrocious.  You're a bad player, sir.  How about Paranoid, sir?  Can you play Paranoid?  From Sabbath?  Oh, my God, now it's so annoying.  Sir, what's wrong with the pedals?  The pedals aren't working, right?  This is so awful.  I don't have it plugged in.  Oh, yeah, good. 
[02:02:00]  Well, why don't you play Paranoid?  Why don't you do something?  Please do something, sir.  Play a little, yeah, something pretty.  A lot of, like, yeah, there you go.  Oh, yeah, I hear that.  I know what song that is.  That's, um...  Stop fiddling with everything.  He keeps fiddling.  It is driving to me crazy. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, his left hand, he's on the box.  He's just fiddling with it incessantly.  And the funniest part is, the amp isn't even plugged in on his head.  No, it's not as plugged in.  It's plugged into the amp on the floor.  It's plugged into the amp on the floor, and he can't stop fucking with it.  The battery is just the cord.  I'm just fiddling.  Sir, how about some distortion?  Why don't you stop fiddling with the amp?  How about some distortion?  It's not plugged into the little amp.  And he keeps fiddling.  Oh, just fumbling with it. 
[02:03:00]  Fiddler with crabs.  It's not even plugged in, damn it.  We know that.  We know, we've been telling you that.  I've been telling you that for four hours already.  There he goes now, he's got it.  He's got it unplugged.  There you go, now lean over there and fumble with it some more.  Oh.  It's horrible.  This is, uh...  Could you tune the inside of your mouth with a shotgun?  This is one of the greatest days ever, man.  There you go.  This is so awful.  It's just great radio.  I love it.  I can't even tell you.  Oh, this is horrible. 
[02:03:30]  All right, here we go.  There we go.  Oh, a little STP.  Yeah, tune it.  Come on, tune it.  Keep playing it.  It keeps getting out of time.  Keep playing that song.  I need another guitar.  All right, cool.  Come on, play that STP song.  Yeah, Stone Temple Pilots, man.  Right, STP.  They're wonderful, beautiful people.  All right, were you...  Okay, maybe not.  Well, she...  What a fine time.  What a fine time.  To butt, butt, Lucille. 
[02:04:00]  Butt, butt, Lucille.  For home...  Party, bankers, jacking...  In a field.  Everybody.  I've had some good butts.  And I've had some bad butts.  This time, your asshole won't heal.  Ah, you take the fine time to butt, butt, Lucille.  Thank you, Kenny Rogers.  All right, go with...  Let's go with...  Oh, I just want to go home. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  Hey, Homicide Guitar Dude, give us a...  Just jam on the guitar now.  Just go for a jam.  Jimmy just said it all.  What did he say?  It bit like a dust.  I just want to go home.  Another one.  Bites to dust.  Oh, that's funny.  All right, here we go.  That amp isn't plugged in, dude.  Stop fumbling with it.  Turn this shit off. 
[02:05:00]  No, come on.  All right.  What are you plugging it...  You're taking it out of the good one, and you're putting it back into the one that doesn't work.  Why don't you stop meddling with that one and put it in the good one?  That's what she said.  He's fucking fumbling with it.  Sir, it was working in this one.  Now it's...  Now you just got to keep reaching down.  You just got to get the cable.  Oh, it's the fucking tuner.  He's just got to keep reaching down.  Work already. 
[02:05:30]  Work already.  I'm used to my little baby.  You understand that, but it was working in that one.  Listen, orange juice.  Oh, will you stop?  It was working in that one.  Speaking of OJ.  Oh, my God almighty.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  It was working in that one, and he plugs it back into the one on his hip.  Of course it was.  Will you stop picking at it and put it back in there? 
[02:06:00]  We're running out of show.  So am I.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Tommy, put it in the big one.  Please stop.  I don't like it.  My ribs are...  Oh.  Will you put it into the one that was working and stop trying to make it all better?  There you go.  Put it in there and just stop incessantly fiddling with the things on your belt.  Tommy, you got to stop.  You can't breathe. 
[02:06:30]  Now you got to pick the other one.  That's a cable.  It's nonstop already since Free FM.  You have been fucking fumbling incompetently with that equipment.  Oh, my God.  It's incompetent equipment.  I am fucking crying.  I'm going to tie straight into the end.  He's still reaching for the left one.  I'm going to break it.  Dude, I...  My ribs are killing me.  I can't take it.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  Sir, if you touch that pedal again, I'm going to throw something at it.  You're touching the pedal.  Just...  You don't need the pedal, sir.  Please?  Yes, I do.  You don't.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Jimmy, let me breathe for 30 seconds.  Please.  Oh.  I'm sitting next to him.  You don't want to.  I haven't left that hard.  It's on the floor.  Dude, I can't take it.  I don't know why this is so funny to me.  Oh, my God.  It is?  Oh, my God.  Now he's...  What are you doing with the one of the... 
[02:07:30]  Now he's with the amp on the floor.  He's plugging it, unplugging it.  Sir, what are you doing?  Just play the fucking instrument.  Just play it.  Strum it.  I'm trying to.  You're not trying to.  You're fucking...  Oh, my God.  You are.  I hate this thing.  I need everything to work properly.  Sir, it's not going to work properly.  I want to go without on the street.  And now you're touching the amp that it's not plugged into.  This is mind-boggling to me that you don't understand how that amp is not working. 
[02:08:00]  Stupid battery shit.  Yeah, we understand it's the battery, but the one on the floor is plugged in,  and your guitar is plugged into that one.  So could you please play us a song?  Do you understand two countries are hearing you fucking fiddle with that equipment,  and now he's unplugging the one on the floor, and he's plugging it back into the one on his hip.  This can't be happening.  All we want is a tune.  You've got to stop.  But it's plugged back into the fucking hip one again. 
[02:08:30]  You've got to stop, Jimmy.  Sir, I mean this with all due respect.  Will you just take that out of there and put it into the one on the floor, please,  so we can hear a song?  It is bugging him so bad.  It's because it is an endless cycle of fiddling, and nothing is getting accomplished.  No, it's just cable here.  I don't care what it is.  Plug it in.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  There.  You sure you don't want to pull it out and plug it back into the hip one again? 
[02:09:00]  Holy shit.  All right.  Are we ready for a song?  Distortion.  We don't care about that.  Just cleaning over it.  Will you stop touching it?  Just play.  Strum.  Watch.  Let's see how long it takes for the one on the hip. 
[02:09:30]  It's not even plugged into the hip.  It's not even plugged into the pedals again.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  There we go.  All right.  Oh, you've got to get the better pick.  Of course.  Of course.  That was the problem.  He doesn't fit.  He doesn't play.  No.  All you do.  There he goes.  He's reaching.  Stop reaching.  Stop.  Stop touching that fucking equipment.  Back off.  He plays and he stops and looks.  He's fiddling with equipment that is not plugged in.  Oh, it's enraging. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, that would sound great with some distortion.  This won't last long.  How can it?  He'll stop in a second.  And he'll fumble with the fucking pedal again.  Look.  He's got to futz.  Oh, my God.  There you go, of course.  I fell on the fucking floor.  I was laughing so hard. 
[02:10:30]  Play some Stone Temple Pilots.  It doesn't sound right.  You need the distortion with the pedals.  Yeah, right.  See?  They use pedals.  You got pedals.  It doesn't have pedals.  It doesn't work.  It's a dirty box.  Listen, we got to get out of here, homeless guitar dude.  It's a dirty box.  Give us one.  There we go, of course.  He's touching.  I'm just touching.  He's always a little, just busybody, a little touchy.  Well, we got a new name, Bo Fiddley. 
[02:11:00]  That's kind of like your equipment up there, right?  Oh, yeah.  I could not fucking breathe.  She went flying down the mountain, doing my 90 miles an hour.  We know, the titties on the spokes.  We heard this one already.  They broke.  We understand what's going to happen here.  Stupid.  We heard this.  He went flying across the grass with a muffler up her ass.  And her titties playing Dixie.  On the spokes. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, nice.  He is so in on the homeless shopping spree.  He's got everything it takes.  He's homeless.  He's annoying.  Grand finale time.  Oh, look, look, look.  There you go.  You got that twist, turn, twist, turn, twist, turn.  Maybe this will make it all better.  Maybe this will bring her back.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  I'll wake up and the comfort will be there and I'll be home.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  Fix it all.  Make everything better.  Twist, turn, plug, unplug, unplug.  What's wrong?  Where's the logo wrong?  Plug, unplug.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  Unplug, unplug.  Put the square. 
[02:12:00]  Unplug, unplug, unplug.  Make it all better.  Make it all better.  Make it all better.  Things didn't turn out this way.  Unplug.  Shake a little.  Shake a little.  Shake a little.  Unplug.  Unplug.  Twist, turn.  All right.  The ambulance is on the way.  Strum, strum, strum.  Oh, tune, tune.  Break, tune.  Plug.  Unplug.  Who cut your hair?  Shut up.  You used that one already.  It'll make it all better.  Okay.  It'll make it all better.  It's your time to play.  It certainly is.  I said what I want to happen.  He did say that.  I want you to give us a really good jam, like a shred, and then I shred. 
[02:12:30]  Give me a shred.  I can't do this.  Yes, you can.  This equipment is messed up.  Do the best you can.  Just shred that guitar.  You already plugged into the big amp, buddy.  It's all you need.  Give me the big sound.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hit it.  Yeah.  You're paranoid.  Yeah, some Sabbath.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Play some Sabbath.  Or that.  There you go, Till.  Might as well.  I told you.  It's a crappy guitar. 
[02:13:00]  We understand that.  We understand.  Wow.  You just won't stop touching everything.  You don't build a house with a rubber handle.  That's a good point.  You don't do that right.  Just stop touching everything.  There you go.  There you go.  That's two times.  That's good.  That's good.  You get a couple of strums out of them.  Oh, God.  Yes, you do.  And you'll be saying that again in about 30 seconds.  Oh, Jesus.  All right. 
[02:13:30]  Never really heard of it.  I don't know how this is done.  Yeah.  You're going to see the end of a Kiss concert, sir?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I can certainly do it.  Pete Townsend, The Who, at Woodstock.  Strangling yourself.  You familiar with that?  I always do.  I hate this stuff, man.  I hate it.  Yeah.  So do we.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't blame you.  This guitar is all you.  By the way, I need room to perform.  You need room to perform?  He's dragging my cord.  Oh, there's my battery. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, you found it.  Thank God.  Things are going to be all better now.  Put it back in the thing.  That's good.  Yeah, put it back in there.  Just to.  What do you want to hear?  What do you want to hear?  I want to hear it.  Crashed up against a wall.  Wow.  Really?  He's heard this show before.  You really don't know this guy very well.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  I can't look.  Oh, fuck.  Here you go. 
[02:14:30]  Now I want you to pick it up and fumble with it.  Fiddle.  Oh, no.  Might work better now.  Jesus Christ.  Now what am I going to do?  Oh, no.  Now what am I going to do?  Body parts.  I was like, treat yourself. 
[02:15:00]  That's better than Howard Stern.  Now what am I going to do?  Now what am I going to do?  Oh, boy.  Did you fix that?  Reality thing.  I don't have anything anymore.  Oh, fuck.  Shit.  At least you saved the strap.  Get the hell off of me. 
[02:15:30]  I don't like scarves.  They're for faggots.  He's looking at his guitar.  I can't play. 
[02:16:00]  Maybe a little glue.  I don't want to play.  You know all he does is play that guitar all day.  It's all he's got.  All the music.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is there a doctor in the house?  You all right?  What about it? 
[02:16:30]  It's very hot.  I don't.  My baby.  My baby's dead.  It's like my last three wives.  Yeah, have a little beer. 
[02:17:00]  I'll straighten it out.  Damn, you can play good.  Thank you, sir.  He plays like Pete Townsend.  The who?  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  No, I mean, he fucks little boys.  What?  Oh, I heard about that.  Yeah, who didn't?  That just needs a little Elmer's glue. 
[02:17:30]  I got some super glue.  Super glue.  Yeah.  Then I bet the switch won't have to.  Imagine the fucking.  Hey, happy holidays.  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.  Oh, God.  Can I throw up now or later?  Right now.  Where's milk, man?  Like a gurgling sound if you can throw up.  I can't believe that. 
[02:18:00]  It's just laying there.  What are you going to do all day?  Yeah, what are you going to do all day?  I bet you play guitar all day, right?  I got some glue.  I can put it together.  I bet you play guitar all day long, right?  That's like all you got, right?  So what are you going to do until you get one?  How much money do you have?  You all right?  You all right, sir?  Hi, baby.  I'll put it together.  You think you could get it back together? 
[02:18:30]  Because I can't imagine what you would do all day.  That's all you got, sir.  It's the music.  Speaking of.  Body parts.  Where's Howard Stern when you need him?  Not here, sir.  Thank you.  He'll make a good one on body parts.  We can get you a serious.  Yeah.  You can live in it.  You could actually live in a serious satellite unit.  That's him.  You could go over.  Well, we'll look. 
[02:19:00]  Jesus.  Setting him up to be robbed.  In the spirit of the holiday.  Yeah.  You all right there, sir?  You all right?  You all right?  You seem a little worked up.  Thinking about the lonely days and nights.  What?  Just passing by now without having anything to play.  You know?  Because that's what you do all day is play guitar, right?  And now what are you going to do? 
[02:19:30]  Jack off.  Couldn't sound any worse.  At least he's got his priorities.  Guitar, jack off.  I hear you.  He probably can't come because he keeps fiddling with his balls and his testicles and the helmet.  Every time he's close to coming, he reaches down and toys or something.  Fiddle in his package.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Make it better.  Fiddle.  Fiddle.  What happened?  Fiddle, fiddle.  You all right?  Wow.  I'll get in another one somehow.  Yeah, somehow.  I guess.  Yeah, once he's picking up the pieces of the guitar. 
[02:20:00]  Actually use the big piece to bash a tourist over the head and rob him.  You can fix that.  I don't rob anybody.  Let me see.  He's trying to put it back together.  You're a man of peace, and so is your guitar.  Pieces?  Nothing?  Okay.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  My jewel says pieces of you.  Hey, someone has a good idea.  Get him some wow stickers to help put the thing on.  Oh, hey, that's a good idea.  What about the neck? 
[02:20:30]  Where's the neck, sir?  It's dangling by his legs.  He's attempting to play the broken guitar.  Put it back together.  Are you going to try to play the broken guitar, sir?  I got my...  Is that fixable?  Yeah, what's the diagnosis?  Is that fixable, you think?  It's just the body is split in half, and the neck is broken off.  All the pickups and stuff have been ripped out, I guess.  But can you fix it? 
[02:21:00]  You know, my dad's got an ultimate set of tools.  I can fix it.  I got an ultimate tool, but it won't fix it.  No, huh?  All right.  What are you going to do now tonight?  Like, you usually hang out and play your guitar, right?  Yeah.  All day and all night.  It's all you do.  Yeah.  So what are you going to do with yourself now?  Play.  I got my wow.  Oh, wow.  He's shaking up. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, he's...  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  He's bothered.  Yeah, he's definitely...  So are you a little upset?  Trying to cover it up with humor.  Are you all right?  Are you all right?  You know there's no crying in guitar playing.  You know that, right?  You're a strong guy trying to cover up with humor that you're a little upset with what happened.  But we understand.  It's okay.  We understand.  Give me some vodka and I'll let you know exactly what I know.  Uh-oh.  Have some vodka. 
[02:22:00]  It's all over, right?  The day.  That's why I don't...  The fiddling.  I don't drink much of it anymore.  Died.  Sir, what are you going to do now that you have nothing to do with it?  I thought you could play guitar.  I played, yeah.  Well, you did a kick-butt job.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to hang out.  Me and you.  Homeless shopping spree.  What's that?  You'll know in a couple weeks.  Yeah.  All right?  It's really good.  You'll enjoy it.  Oh, boy. 
[02:22:30]  Should I?  Yeah, it's this...  He's all fucking...  Well, it's just because it's Thanksgiving, though.  He's really bad.  Oh, my God.  He's crying.  I'm a little...  He's crying.  Dude, he's fucking crying.  Are you crying?  No.  Oh, yes, he is.  Oh, boy.  Sir, that's all you had.  Yeah.  That's my baby.  Help the nigger out.  Come on.  Well, here's the deal, you know.  Sir, what are you trying to plug that into?  I don't know.  There's nothing to play.  Stop fiddling.  So you plug that into what? 
[02:23:00]  It's all he does all day.  Don't you understand?  Now it's forced to habit.  What does he play?  So there's no playing...  He's turning volume knobs.  He's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is he going to try to play air guitar?  Yeah, but play air guitar.  Maybe that'll work.  There you go.  All right, now you're rocking.  All right.  Now fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle a little, and then play some air guitar.  I've got to have my wow.  I've got to have that.  Yeah.  Well, the wow's in half, too.  I was going to put it on my guitar.  Well, yeah. 
[02:23:30]  That won't happen.  That won't happen.  Because that's in parts, too.  Sir, what are you going to do now?  Did you have nothing to do?  All right.  There you go.  I am rock, you are low.  I am you wish you're not.  I am I will prevail.  Fiat.  I am black ugly monster.  Now air guitar.  There you go. 
[02:24:00]  You kiddle, damn bitch.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Oh, my God.  All right.  That's what I normally do.  It's a little known fact that right around Thanksgiving, I tend to break out of character.  There's not going to be any turkeys this year.  Oh, for the holidays, you're coming out of Thanksgiving, Ant.  All right.  Just for Thanksgiving.  It's a once, one time a year that I do the right thing.  Please let the audience know who we're speaking with here.  What? 
[02:24:30]  Let the audience know who's speaking.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  A little known fact that right around Thanksgiving every year, I break character to do the right  thing.  It only happens once a year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  John.  You know, some of you might have laughed today when, oh, look, he's upset.  John.  Hey.  We only break down the eighth wall the day before Thanksgiving.  It's very rare.  This only happens once a year. 
[02:25:00]  Sir.  Enjoy.  Look at what we got for you.  Enjoy your brand new guitar.  That's for you, my friend.  That's for you.  That's for you.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Now plug it in and play something for us.  And you rock, God damn it.  Play something for us.  Plug that in and fucking rock.  Play something.  Play something for us.  Brand new fucking guitar.  Wow.  This is like, this is like Tyra.  Oh.  A Schechter, my friend.  I just had an orgasm.  Oh.  I love it. 
[02:25:30]  I am the rock.  Now play.  Now play your heart out.  I'm going to have to learn how to fiddle on that fucking thing.  Oh, look.  He's fiddling.  Jesus Christ.  If you reach for that, I'm going to break it.  Give me an E, you.  Yeah, give him an E.  Give me an F.  E.  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  I'm never going to get the fuck out of here with him tuning this thing.  Listen, man.  Once a year.  Oh.  Only once a year. 
[02:26:00]  That was like one of those end of an episode things where you sit there and go,  Hi.  You know, we may have all laughed today at a homeless man's expense.  There you go.  All is right with the world, sir.  He's fucking terrible.  Dude, you like the guitar?  It's fucking awful.  What a waste of a great guitar.  He went right back to fiddling.  It sounds...  If he fucking fiddles with one more thing, I'm going to fiddling. 
[02:26:30]  Oh.  It immediately turned into a shit.  Hey, of course, yes.  I love this.  You love it?  How can you suck this bad if you do it all day?  All day.  How is it?  How's the action for you?  Good?  You like it?  I love it.  All right.  Take it away from him.  I love it. 
[02:27:00]  You know, I play guitar, too.  So I have to break the news to him.  All right.  Can you play us out of here?  We've got to go home for the holiday.  Yes.  Well, that's actually a place.  We've got family to see, homes to be in.  And not only the guitar, but we've got a bar of soap for you and you and a bar of soap for you.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  He's fiddling.  What's he doing and why?  What's he doing and why? 
[02:27:30]  What are you doing?  Why are you twisting that knob?  Can I ask?  As a novice, you're gone awful at this.  All that fiddling and it sounds exactly as it did.  Stop fucking fiddling.  Jimmy hit the nail on the head, though, which is just trying to fix his life.  Of course he is.  And through the symbolism of all that.  If I do it this way, I'll have a place to live.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Let's go.  Play us out.  That's all we want.  Oh, now he's sitting on it.  Where's the, where's the my children's loaf knob?  You know, I need to turn that up.  Oh, boy, it's fiddling. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, God.  It just sounds like he's got his fingers stuck in the strings.  Chilling.  Oh, forget it. 
[02:29:00]  Stinks.  Johnny Slobo.  What?  Give us some distortion on that sucker.  What distortion?  Nothing can help this.  Unless you want that guitar distorted like your last one.  Quick job, bitch.  He's the worst guitarist I've ever heard. 
[02:29:30]  He is the worst.  Line of the day sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  I've got to watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a battle against the Russians.

[02:30:00]  Yes.  And finally, thanks to Bodogfight.com, here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Goddamn, that feedback is killing my ears.

Anthony with the line of the day.  Eric Crapton.  Jimmy's laugh.  It made me happy.  Hey, do we have to?  We don't have to go to break, right?  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  The L.A. Times called his speech poignant.  Are you shitting me?  No.  The stupid L.A. Times.  What happened?  They said that he had a poignant. 
[02:31:00]  Can you dig that?  Oh, brother.  I knew that you could.  Called his speech poignant.  Yeah.  All right.  Have a great weekend.  That can also mean sucks.  Hey, after the break, you want him just in studio until noon?  Do you think I give a flying fuck?  I will be gone.  Just turn on his mic after the break and see what's going on, all right?  Sure.  We'll have him fiddle until Ron and Fez get here.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  See you at holidays.  Jimmy, one of the biggest laughs in a long time.  My fucking stomach hurts. 
[02:31:30]  Just fiddling.  Knock it off.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Oh, okay.  This is Big A.  Oh, sorry.  This is Big A.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Now, stop staring at me and all the rest of.

[02:33:30]  Fit kicker radio, where the radio is real with the real fit kicker.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show Tip of the Day on XMRadio.  If your tech suggests a fuel injection cleaning, you may want to have it done.  Fuel injection cleaning is a must for proper maintenance and fuel economy on electronically fuel-injected vehicles.  Because of the nature of gasoline to leave gum and varnish deposits in the fuel system, this dirt must be cleaned out periodically. 
[02:34:00]  Not only that, but unburned gas inside the combustion chambers causes carbon deposits to build up in the engine.  This carbon acts like a sponge, in that when the air-fuel mixture is injected into the combustion chamber, the carbon saps the fuel out of the mixture and creates a lean condition.  A lean fuel mixture results in hard, cold starting, poor performance, and a computer trying to overcompensate for the lean condition it sees by excessively richening the fuel mixture.  Fuel system cleaning every 35,000 miles avoids this.

Let's go to Sarah in Louisiana.  Sarah. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Sarah.  Hey, Sarah.  Hi, how are y'all?  Good.  Hi.  Hey, listen, I'm just calling to give y'all a woman.  Kind of point of view about the game system.  All right.  We always like the woman's point of view on things.  That's right.  I know because y'all are just such a fabulous, feministic type of show.  Yes.  But I just wanted to say that gaming is for absolute losers that can't play the real world.  It just drives me freaking bananas.  And I can't stand men that sit around and play these video systems or camp out for these 
[02:37:00]  lame game systems.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Let me ask you a question.  Are you married?  Yes, I'm married.  And your husband plays too many video games instead of fucking you.  Is that correct?  No.  No?  Okay.  I wouldn't think of it.  I wouldn't have married him.  I wouldn't have married a game nerd.  A game nerd.  A game nerd.  Why are you so annoyed at them?  All right, go ahead.  Why do men play Tiger Woods golf?  Because they can't play it in the real world.  Why do men play MVP baseball? 
[02:37:30]  Let me tell you something.  Why do men box?  Because we get arrested for hitting you.  Let me tell you something there, Sarah.  I actually play Tiger Woods golf.  Yeah.  And I've been known to shoot some numbers on a real golf course.  Well, then why not just go do that?  I do.  Well, you can't every day.  But when you're on a flight that's over three, four hours and you've got a PSP in your hand,  it makes sense to me to play a little Tiger Woods golf.  And if you want to play Medal of Honor, why don't we just go out and shoot people?  Right.  It's like, you know. 
[02:38:00]  No.  If you want to play Medal of Honor, just go join the military.  See, that's a little extreme.  If you want to be a soldier, go join the military.  Well, I agree with you.  Sarah, hold on.  I hate gaming.  But Anthony plays it.  And Anthony's not a zero.  Thank you.  I mean, honestly.  I mean, I would love to tell you you're a zero.  But you're not.  I mean, you're a guy I know well enough.  But he is a shut-in.  Anthony's a shut-in and a psychopath.  Yeah.  But he's not a zero.  Thank you.  I do agree with you that the game stinks, though, Sarah.  But again, why don't you just use that logic and say, why do people watch movies instead 
[02:38:30]  of just going out and living a romantic comedy?  It is kind of a dumb argument.  Using her logic, she wants Anthony to run around in the woods somewhere with a bunch of  fairies.  It's just a...  Instead of doing...  No.  Meanwhile, he works with them.  No.  I completely understand if you play games in a leisure-type manner.  But when you're camping out for days, waiting on a game system, you're over the edge.  You need to come back to reality.  I would never do that.  She's right.  Sarah, what else don't you allow...  That's a loser.  Sarah, what else do you not let your husband do? 
[02:39:00]  Well, I don't ever restrict my husband.  He can do what he pleases.  He's a grown man.  I'm a grown woman.  What if he wanted to start playing video games?  If you want to play video games, you can play it at a leisure.  You don't have to be at an...  Leisure means your time, the time you allow him to play it, right?  It doesn't mean my time.  By the way, I absolutely loved your show about men's vacations.  I found that very interesting.  Mancations.  The mancations.  Mancations.  That was fabulous.  You guys are just absolutely fabulous.  Sarah, the reviews on your phone call are coming in. 
[02:39:30]  All right.  I like her.  Oh, Lord.  Mixed reviews.  She's got spunk.  I like Sarah.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Mixed reviews coming in.  Well, I love y'all.  Will you shut the fuck up?  She loves us, y'all.  Enough!  It's time for a man to talk!  Some men are going to do some talking.  Holy shit!  Y'all can't handle me is what the problem is. 
[02:40:00]  We like you.  Thank God we don't have to handle you.  How's that?  Well, thank God.  But also, I mean, I'm just stunned that more women don't call in about your shows.  I heard that one show about your wife gaining like 50 pounds over a 10-year period and you  need to ditch her.  I'm not saying that I excuse what is going on.  No woman should gain any excessive amount of weight during a marriage.  You do sign up for what you get in the initial contract.  But at the same time, men don't keep their figure either.  And you have to be more objective.  Anthony, the reviews on Sarah's phone call are coming in. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, Lord.  We got Bill from Waterford.  They're mixed reviews, but let's read a few of these.  Sarah is a fun-killing video game cunt.  Go fuck yourself with a joystick video game fun ruiner.  Dan from Queensbury.  Don't send feedback for a minute, guys.  I've got to read some of these.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I have to go back a page, Anthony.  How do I do that? 
[02:41:00]  Like that?  All right.  Like that?  Dan from Queensbury.  Ask Sarah if I can play cunt puncher 2K6.  I'm with Sarah.  I'm with Sarah.  Mixed reviews.  No kin to a monkey from Michigan writes,  tell this cunt to lick my asshole while I play Halo.  More mixed reviews coming in from someone's cell phone.  It just says, cunt.  What, Sarah?  You know what?  They wouldn't be this vindictive.  RJ from Columbus, Ohio has this to say about Sarah. 
[02:41:30]  Very mixed reviews.  Yeah.  Shit.  RJ writes, why do men jerk off?  Because their bitches don't know how to fuck properly.  Ty from Maryland says, I bet if this cunt's husband got her a $3,000 ring,  she'd shit her pants.  People pay money for games, and she's losing her pudding-filled mind.  Whatever.  These are all game losers. 
[02:42:00]  They're giving Sarah a hard time when she's being an aggressive woman  and saying that you should be deep-dicking your woman  instead of fucking sitting there on a computer,  and I don't disagree with her.  More mixed reviews coming in, though, Jimmy.  It's so far, it's been 50-50.  Yeah, 50-50, okay.  The pile driver.  Rob from Houston, sounds like her husband needs to go out  and buy the game called Kill the Cunt.  Patman from Foxborough, tell this bitch to shut up.  Most people that are waiting in line are selling their PS3s on eBay for $3,000. 
[02:42:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  That's who I am.  Obviously, my husband is fucking happy and sexy.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Shut up.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Shut up.  More mixed reviews.  Adam from Freehold.  This woman needs a dick in her mouth to shut her the fuck up. 
[02:43:00]  I like her.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Where are the mixed reviews?  You're only saying one fucking side.  Where's the mixed reviews?  You're too fucking smart for me, missus.  You're right, Sarah.  Put it in your mouth about the negative fucking side.  Show the other side.  Good point, Sarah.  I'm with you.  I'm doing mixed reviews.  You like that game?  You're going to be able to fucking handle me.  Hey, do you like the game?  Hey, hey, hey.  Do you like the game duck hunt?  Is that what your husband says when he throws something at you? 
[02:43:30]  Duck hunt.  More mixed reviews coming in, Anthony.  Yes.  Ramone, tell this cunt's husband to bash her head in with a PS3.  Tie from Maryland.  Well, Pat from Trenton, New Jersey.  Sarah's a cunt with a capital C.  That is the only word your uneducated male audience says.  You're right.  Exactly.  I'd rather come in my own face than wait longer than an hour for a fucking video game system. 
[02:44:00]  There you go.  There's one for you there.  I agree with Sarah.  People are agreeing with you.  If you're sitting out there waiting for a video game, you are a bag of shit.  If you're going to play it.  Frickin' loser.  A loser.  I think that video gaming, you want to spend a couple hours playing fine.  But anyone that dedicates their life to it, you should be deep-dicking you abroad.  Face first.  She put her face there.  You straddle her legs from the outside, and you give her a nice, thick, deep-dicking.  Well, Mark from the Bronx, Sarah should suck her husband's cock more so he doesn't have to keep visiting 15-year-old Thai whores. 
[02:44:30]  I bet she does suck her husband's cock.  How do you like them apples?  I didn't hear you.  She's running, running, running your mouth.  Ooh.  Shit.  You're frustrating me.  You're not even listening.  I'm not saying don't play games in leisure.  I'm telling men who are sitting outside.  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays.  I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still tap.  That's right.  Damone.  He knows. 
[02:45:00]  Steve from Albany.  This cunt probably drags her husband to chip flicks on Sunday so he doesn't get to watch the big game.  Why would you think I...  My husband is very independent.  I believe in a mutual marriage respect.  I'm independent.  He is independent.  You need to find yourself a real bitch like me.  And then you'll know that women are out for your blood.  All I'm trying to tell you and all your male audience is if you're camped out waiting for...  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Stop it. 
[02:45:30]  Quiet.  Stop whining.  I've listened to it for like three weeks straight.  You're so pig-headed and negative.  And then when a woman does call in to touch with you...  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm on your side, Sarah.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Hey, I've been nice to you.  Don't whatever me, you fucking hole with teeth.  I've been fucking...  The only one going to bat for you.  And you're going to whatever me, you emasculating piglet.  I'll give your mouth a swing.  I'll give you a good fucking gonorrhea throat fuck. 
[02:46:00]  Stupid.  Stupid.  Don't fucking whatever me when I'm on your side.  Shut up.  Oh, that woman.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  Put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put.  I had to play a video game called give you a tea bagging and make you smell onions for the next 12 hours.  How'd you like a nice fucking oniony ball bag on your nose bridge?  Straighten you right out, Missy.  I'm telling you, you all are just so classically educated. 
[02:46:30]  I love it.  We're educated.  Listen to you, you fucking hillbilly.  You're going to be watching Hee Haw with a fist up your cunt.  Of course.  That's your Yankee dumbass mentality about the South.  Well, listen to you, you dope.  You don't sound like a surgeon.  Well, sounds like we've got to go in through the top of the head.  Shut your face, stupid.  Shut up.  Okay.  Fucking kneel down in your trailer and service whatever relative you're married to.  What do you think of them apples?  I like them apples. 
[02:47:00]  I was trying to be nice to you, and you brought out the ugliness.  Yes.  That's right.  Nobody could bring out the ugliness out of you.  He was?  Exactly, because there is no ugliness.  It's all flowers.  You know what?  I'd like to stand on line for three hours to watch people fish into your vagina and call it noodling.  I'd like to go noodling in your vagina with Freddy Krueger gloves on.  What do you think of them apples?  You fucking no loyalty to the only guy defending you twat.  Yeah, you didn't even realize he was defending you.  Completely.  I'd like to rub a salty booger on your lips and then give your nose a little tweak-a-roo. 
[02:47:30]  If he was defending me, he would have already read some responses that agree with me.  First of all, we're two different people.  That's Opie.  I'm Jim Norton, you fucking dummy.  Opie was reading the feedback.  I'm across the room.  I don't have fucking eagle vision.  Although, I wish I had an eagle beak so I could snip your clit off and spit it at you.  I want to snip off your clit and then sit on a dollar bill and spit it at you.  Opie dear, are you the twerp with the little pubic hair going around your chin, or are you the blonde with the shit face? 
[02:48:00]  Well, if you don't listen to the show for three weeks, there's three of us.  Anthony is the one with the pubic hair.  I have the pubic hair.  An openie, openie, openie.  It really is hard to say.  Sarah, are you trying to say I'm ugly?  Well, which one are you?  He's the blonde-haired god.  Are you actually trying to say that I am ugly?  No, I am not trying to say you're ugly.  You dope.  You are stupid. 
[02:48:30]  She was very badly raped, you see?  Wouldn't we love to see that?  No, she's dead.  Here's Kevin from Connecticut, a positive one for Sarah.  I like Sarah, but then again, I also like shaping animals out of poo.  What do you think of that?  You're a shit rhino.  Quiet shit rhino.  Some men are talking.  To the guys out there, someone is married to this bitch.  Someone has...  I bet her husband is such a henpeck. 
[02:49:00]  Do you strap it on and give him a good fuck if he doesn't work enough overtime?  Do you rape his bottom with a strap on?  Shut up, Paul.  I'm not going to have you disrespect my husband who would...  Ah, your husband's a fucking seed drinker.  He loves nothing more than to pinch the ball vein of a man and squirt that seed down his own throat.  That's what your husband does.  And then he touches your kids inappropriately.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Sarah, you do know that your husband is cheating on you, right?  Yes, he is.  You do know that, right? 
[02:49:30]  He's cheating on me.  He absolutely is, too.  He's just good at hiding it.  With a Laotian boy.  He is absolutely cheating on you.  No one can handle you, sir.  You're an obnoxious mess.  Do you realize that the...  I love listening to you all because I just get this fabulous view of what men are really thinking.  Exactly.  We think you're dumb.  Your husband's thinking the same thing, sweetie.  Your husband's thinking the same thing.  Yep.  You just think he's thinking differently.  He's thinking the same thing, that you are indeed a cunt. 
[02:50:00]  And he's fucking somebody behind your back.  Right now, he's rubbing scented oils onto the washboard abs of a young Thai boy.  Perhaps a 13 or 14-year-old.  He's rubbing scented oil onto the boy's belly.  Hello, exactly!  And the boy doesn't speak good English, so he just kicks out his feet and goes,  Ah-ha!  Ah-ha!  And makes some dumb Asian noise.  Can I kiss you on the mouth?  Sarah?  You're getting a reaction, though.  Ash?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  She hung up.  She hung up.  Did she?  I swear to God, she hung up. 
[02:50:30]  I know you didn't.  I know you didn't.  Why?  I was going to Ashley, and I swear to God, she hung up.  Well, she's still listening.  Poor Sarah couldn't take it.  Ashley from Kansas City, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to call in and say, if you guys let this bitch jab her on for two  more minutes, I'm going to have to stab her in her eye with my stiletto.  She is not indicative of all women, and she is just, she needs to be off there.  I'm glad she hung up.  Yeah, let's get into this a little bit.  She was fun.  What is that broad all about?  She's just a dope.  I don't know.  I don't know, but I guarantee she's in a sexless marriage, and her husband is fucking 
[02:51:00]  a little blonde girl on the side.  Yeah, something's going on there, because look, yes, I like an opinionated woman.  I like a woman that speaks up a bit, sure.  Absolutely.  But there's something going on in that girl's world.  Her husband has never said to her, just shut your mouth, bitch.  Right.  Shut up.  All right.  She needs a good smack right across the face, and I'm all about women's rights, but she's  an ignorant.  The right to be punched.  She is one of these women who likes to let everyone know she's in charge. 
[02:51:30]  Not even in the privacy of the home, where it's like, you know, I bash the husband around  a little bit, tell him what to do.  This is one of those, like, at family functions and out at a party or something.  She's always lambasting the husband.  Just, what do you do?  Oh, you know what he's like.  Oh, the old idiot.  Let me tell you what this jackass did the other day.  That's what she's all about.  Just emasculating her man.  And meanwhile, he's sprinkling glass in her food, like fucking they did to Tony Masanti 
[02:52:00]  in the first season of Oz.  I hope she shits a lot of blood and wonders why.  But not even good, solid blood shits.  No.  The type that go, and spray the toilet with blood, like it's a fucking paintball accident.  That's what I hope.  I hope you're taking a bleeding, loud shit.  What do you think of them apples?  The back of a bowl looks like spin art.  Hey, Ashley, thank you. 
[02:52:30]  Thank you, guys.  Punching out.  That woman was a little too much, to be honest there.  And Jimmy was actually defending her, but that stupid twat couldn't even hear it.  She couldn't hear beyond a man's voice.  Yep.  It's just the voice must have meant that you didn't like her, because you're a man.  So she had to jump back tenfold and try to give it back to you with her sass.  It just shows you the virus is spreading, because it's spreading to people.  What happens is, with this show, you enjoy what we do, and then you tell people about it, 
[02:53:00]  and they don't have the same sense of humor as you.  So they don't like it.  So then they start listening, and they just hate it, and then they can't help themselves,  and they've got to call the show.  The worst thing is to do a show that people just don't care about.  Like, you tell somebody about a show, and they tune in, and you go,  oh, yeah, I kind of listened to it.  I think I don't remember much about it or something.  But when friends who really like the show, friends of the show, tell other people, 
[02:53:30]  and they despise this program, they are better fans than the ones that really enjoy it.  Right.  That fucking twat will listen to every word we utter.  Every word.  And I hope she calls back.  Douchebag listener from Wackbag.  Yeah, we can't let you off the hook on this one, Ant.  Did you guys hear Ant's sounds of disgust when Opie said,  I like an opinionated woman?  Pretty funny.  Oh, yeah, because I know you're just lying.  I'm not.  Absolutely not. 
[02:54:00]  Who likes an opinionated?  Isn't that like bitchy?  Isn't opinionated a good word for bitchy?  Yeah.  No, it's a woman with opinions.  Smart and wise.  Ways, but opinionated has a negative connotation to it.  It sounds like, oh, she's opinionated.  Who has her opinions?  That should be heard.  Yeah.  Every woman has opinions.  So what's wrong with opinionated?  Hey, they're like assholes. 
[02:54:30]  Opinions.  That's right.  Yeah, they stink.  All right, we got another broad on the line that hates Sarah.  Sometimes there's blood on him.  Tammy.  Yes?  You're a broad, right?  What was that?  You're a broad and you're happy to be a broad, right?  That's right.  And I'm blonde and I'm beautiful and she's pissing me off.  If she's going to dish it out, she needs to be able to take it.  Right.  Dish out the blowjobs and take the cocks in the ass.  You're right.  That's right.  And my husband plays games and he works and he can play games whenever he wants. 
[02:55:00]  No big deal.  But he also is not sitting in line at Best Buy this morning waiting for a game.  No.  Look, man.  You know, to say that all gamers are losers is so stupid.  Only 99%.  I really do believe that people online waiting for a PS3 are losers.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Or criminals.  I think that Sarah needs to listen to the Oprah show, not y'all show, because apparently she's  not cut out for this program, so.  All right.  Yeah.  But she's still listening right now.  Oh, right now she is listening. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, what do you have to say to her, Tammy?  She's listening.  She can't help herself.  Well, she called in and she's, you know, all self-righteous and everything and saying  how she loves you guys, but once the table's turned and she's all pissed off and she's  cussing everybody out, I just don't think, I think she needs to get a life.  All right.  Get a life, you told her.  Easy with the harsh statements.  Should she buzz off as well?  Hey, this is the, you know, Joe makes a good point.  Thank you, Tammy. 
[02:56:00]  We've got to let you go.  Joe from Whackbag, I guarantee that she's going to go and tell her husband that he's  not allowed to listen to the show anymore.  Yeah.  That happens a lot, actually, with this show.  But she'll still listen.  But she won't allow her husband to listen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sign on for a while, sign on, spank out a few.  Been so long I could not remember, my password wasn't stored. 
[02:56:30]  Sign on for a while, at least until I spew.  I've been searching that world wide web to find that slut again.  Internet porn.  I whacked until the night became a brand new day. 
[02:57:00]  My junk was firm, but now it's limp like sculpting clay.  Internet porno still can make me feel that way.  Look at what I've done.  My keyboard, it's a mess.  I should pick up that pile of Kleenex in the corner of my room. 
[02:57:30]  I can't use the word come in the context of this song.  So I'll just say, shoot, spew, and spurt.  That verse I wrote for me, internet porn.  I jerked all night like retards, do they say?  Whether you're hetero, bisexual, or gay. 
[02:58:00]  Internet porn will always make you feel that way.  Welcome.  Well done. 
[02:58:30]  Goodbye.  Internet porn.  Too many hours whacking.  I've been up for days.  Pounding my pod until it looked like mule pâté.  Internet porno always makes me feel that way.  Internet porn. 
[02:59:00]  My family has not seen me for days.  And my wife is pissed, cause she's not getting laid.  Internet porno always makes you feel that way.  Maybe let me wrap these lips around here. 
[02:59:30]  Nice and tight.  Internet porno always makes me feel this way.  Hey, this is Anthony's brother Joe, NotYouTube.com.  That was one of my songs, NotYouTube.com.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.

[03:04:30]  Mark Foley.  All right.  Lowdown.  Daily News.  Lowdown has unearthed some of Foley's weirder whoppers from his relentless June 2003 campaign  against child-oriented nudist camps in Florida, which reaped a television bonanza.  Bonanza.  This guy was all over our TV.  We didn't even know it until these allegations came out.  How many more?  Foley on CNN, June 20th, talking about the child-oriented nudist camps in Florida.  You put 11 and 18-year-olds together in a camp where they're nude, I think it's a recipe 
[03:05:00]  for disaster.  It's like putting a match next to a gasoline can.  It's like a disaster for your wife doing the laundry.  Oof.  That's the only disaster that spells.  Jesus.  He must have gotten so worked up at the thought of that.  He was trying to buy land so he could use it for those.  I'm going to buy up all the land.  I'd like a parcel, please.  I'd like a parcel of land.  All around the nudist camps.  Looks like an observatory at his house.  Trying to steal the Glengarry Glen Ross leads so he can buy the cheapest land possible. 
[03:05:30]  You know what this comes down to?  The guy got caught by his wife.  You think?  And then said, no, no, it's research.  And then start a whole campaign.  A whole campaign.  I'm going to be on CNN on Monday.  You'll see.  Oh, God.  Yeah, she saw a newsletter that came at nudist camp weekly.  What is this all about?  Research.  Research.  I'm a new law.  I'm going to try to.  Oh, Jesus.  That was a close one.  Why are these nude boys frolicking around a volleyball net?  Volleyball. 
[03:06:00]  It's always about volleyball.  Sure, it is.  A lot of bounce.  Yeah.  I'll have luster hair like that, dummy.  So then he went on MSNBC June 23rd, a mere three days later.  This is Mark Foley.  I do have to question why people, if this is such a natural endeavor, have to put it in  a hot tub with 18 others, if you will, enjoying this kind of activity.  These kids are young.  I think that they should maybe be learning something other than being nude together and  being thrown in a hot tub.  Yeah.  Maybe visiting you in San Diego or D.C., you pervert. 
[03:06:30]  Or hopefully whatever career you have after this.  How great is that?  Oh, he's finished.  Finished.  Al, don't dump out of this.  His goose is cooked.  Hey, hey.  Oof.  You are pushing the boundaries, Jim.  Well, the XMers heard it.  He was obsessed with this issue.  He was obsessed with this issue because a mere day later on the early show on CBS, in fact,  in the very camp we're talking about in Florida, Florida, excuse me, there have been people  ejected because they're trying to enter the camp because they're peering through sauna windows. 
[03:07:00]  Sauna windows?  So everyone is aware of these camps and they're trying to get on.  They ought to match those fingerprints up with a certain congressman and his nose print.  It's a perfect picture of his face in steam.  Yeah, it's like the Shroud of Torrin.  Oh, God, this is made for us.  Is this made for us?  Oh, my God.  I love this guy.  Same day, just obsessed with this on Good Morning America, so he marched across town. 
[03:07:30]  Same day, he's all over town preaching.  In fact, they've coined an expression for people that visit these parts.  They call them cogs, creepy old guys.  He said this.  I swear.  He said this.  Creepy old guys are called cogs.  Or maps.  You are a cog.  It's in the children's most formative years.  I think they'd be better off at Girl Scout camp, Boy Scout camp, or sports camp than a nudist camp.  Or paging for me, math 54. 
[03:08:00]  You know what it is?  He likes the uniforms.  He likes them in Boy Scout camp.  They all look lovely in their shorts and their socks and their Eagle Scout buttons.  I like the little ties.  They just do it for me.  Little hats.  Earn your badge, son.  Kid walks away, buckling his pants, upset, wiping leaves off his hat.  You know how much a Boy Scout hates to wipe leaves off his hat?  You've earned your kept a secret badge. 
[03:08:30]  Good boy.  Oh, I love this guy.  Yeah.  He is the biggest creep, and I'm so glad he's done.  Jim from Yonkers, a great instant feedback.  And I didn't know this.  Maybe you guys did.  Boys, Foley is single.  A confirmed bachelor, if you know what I mean.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A confirmed bachelor.  That's – I'm not as happy with that.  I'd hope there'd be a whole family to just destroy over that one.  Wife, kids, just like McGreevy. 
[03:09:00]  A couple of boys who thought those tuck-ins were normal.  And then the creep goes on the O'Reilly factor.  Ah, and I'm sure Bill was all for him, right?  Two filthbags.  Two perverts.  Two guys – one guy who's getting caught with the emailing young boys,  and another one that had to pay off some broad.  Oh, because he was allegedly making statements to her in the workplace.  How great is it that those two put those stupid heads together?  There they are.  The moral right, both of them. 
[03:09:30]  This is what he said on the O'Reilly factor, June 29th.  Five days later.  Five days later.  Who else wants to talk about this?  I've got to take a break from this.  This guy, Foley, won't stop calling.  He wants to talk about a boys' camp.  Why couldn't we get him on the show, man?  Ah, let's see.  The parents said, oh, they're supervised.  They have camp counselors.  They have custodial people there to watch out for them.  Well, again, several cases have come to my attention  where the camp managers themselves have been arrested, charged with pornography. 
[03:10:00]  Ah.  Let's hope Foley is getting the rehab he deserves, is how the whole article ends.  Yeah, let's all hope for him.  Let's hope so.  Let's hope.  We'll pray for his lie.  I hope it ends with a shotgun blast to his own face.  Oh, God, and he survives it.  Oh, and has to be faceless MAF 54.  Or he loses his hand, so he has to, like, type with his nose because he's still a dick.  Oh, just stump typing.  Chafed wrists. 
[03:10:30]  Just spending all day trying to figure out how to type with a stump.  Oh, God.  He has to put a pin in it, like a pin cushion.  See?  Oh.  What does W-A-S-D-E-R-F mean?  Pfft.  Just clobbering the keyboard.  I want to suck your W-A-S-T-E-R-L-F.  Yeah, he gets up to that point where he can write all that out.  It's too worked up, and his stump hits the keyboard. 
[03:11:00]  Right.  I bet you have a nice, smooth kashunka.  Oh, I want to feel your full space blast.  Oh, he's all lathered up.  I love him.  He's terrific.  This is C. Montgomery Burns, and you're frittering away your morning, or your life, listening to Opie and Anthony.  I wrote a new one, and I want to debut it today for you. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  All right.  It's about a girl.  Really?  I see you there, behind the glass.  I drop a quarter in the slot, and then I watch you as you shake that ass.  I watch you grind. 
[03:12:00]  I watch you dance.  I show you mine, you show me yours, and when we're done, I button up my pants.  And my friends all laugh, my friends all scoff when I say I love a girl, loves to take it off.  But I tell them they're crazy, because I've been around the world, and there's nothing wrong with nothing with my peep show, girl. 
[03:12:30]  No.  No, there's nothing wrong.  I love your mind, I love your soul, I love it when you grease your body and you slide it up and down that pole, yeah.  I love your hair, I love your eyes, and I know that you feel the same way, 
[03:13:00]  because I can see the love dripping down your thighs.  And my mama would laugh, my mama would scoff, if she knew I love a girl, loves to take it off.  And she'd probably disown me if she met my little pearl, but there's nothing wrong with my peep show, girl.  No.  No, there's nothing wrong, nothing wrong. 
[03:13:30]  So now I'm broke, you've let me dry, and it's amazing how much money that a guy'll spend to taste a little pie.  But I'm okay, I'm a little sore, I can't believe that I found love in a place where my feet stick to the floor.  And I went to confession, and the preacher said, no, it's a sin to love a girl who isn't pure as driven snow. 
[03:14:00]  I said, preacher, I don't care, man, I found heaven in this world.  And there's nothing wrong, preacher, with my peep show, girl.  No.  No, there's nothing wrong, nothing wrong, with my peep show, girl.  Opie and Anthony.

[03:17:30]  And now, a minute with the New York Times.  Here's health and nutrition columnist Jane Brody.  An apology to all baby boomers.  In trying to get everyone physically active, we've sold you a bill of goods.  A 30-minute walk on most days is just not enough to keep you fit as you age.  And fitness is crucial to preventing injuries and being able to perform the tasks of daily living.  That walk may help your heart and weight.  But you also need activities that strengthen muscles and improve flexibility and balance. 
[03:18:00]  Orthopedic surgeons are seeing an epidemic of what they call boomeritis.  Baby boomers who develop tendinitis, bursitis, arthritis, and fix-me-itis.  A new book called Age-Defying Fitness, written by two prominent physical therapists,  can help you counter the inevitable declines that accompany aging.  With this book, you can assess your physical vulnerabilities,  and the well-illustrated and clinically tested exercises will help you correct them. 
[03:18:30]  This is Jane Brody of the New York Times.  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-Canada, 877-438-9677.  Is it true that it was Employee Appreciation Day yesterday in Washington?  Oh, God damn.  I'm so glad you brought this up.  But is it true?  Yes.  It really was true.  I believe it was. 
[03:19:00]  Can we confirm this with anybody?  Ron and Fez weren't on the air yesterday.  Went down to Washington.  They took a travel day.  Yeah.  Then they're doing the show.  Look.  And they're taking a travel day back.  We've been sent over there like on the Amistad.  We're right off.  We're just working.  And then we get back on a train.  But this is what I do love about XM.  We bitch a lot.  I understand that.  But in regular radio, you're never allowed to take as many days off as you're allowed on satellite radio.  What was the trip? 
[03:19:30]  It was Vegas.  We did one two-hour broadcast or two two-hour broadcasts, and we had to take five days off.  Yes.  Five days off.  To complete it.  And I'm just like, yeah, all right.  Whatever, man.  Free vacation for all.  So there is a lot of good as far as satellite radio goes.  Was it really employee appreciation yesterday in Washington?  Is that really a $5 smoothie?  Thank you, Kenny.  They hate us so much down there.  But is it true?  Because that's what I hear, why Ron and Fez weren't on the air the last couple days. 
[03:20:00]  Went down for employee appreciation day.  Yeah.  Wait.  What does it say?  Come on.  Let's see where state it is.  Come on.  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  All right.  They got the Tuesday schedule.  That's today.  Uh, the broads, uh, broad-minded.  A show we had a little problems with.  Yeah.  What a surprise.  The broads broadcast live from XM's parking lot for employee appreciation day.  Don't be talking with XM's Ron and Fez.  Dude, there's a big fair, like a big party. 
[03:20:30]  Offer XM colleagues guidance from a panel of their favorite mystics, including psychic Sherry Sherry, numerologist Lloyd Strayhorn, and dream analyst Forbes Robbins Blair.  Do you understand?  It was employee appreciation day in Washington.  You guys have to laugh along with us today.  Not only did we not go, I swear to you, I am the one that reads all the corporate email every day.  We weren't even invited. 
[03:21:00]  We weren't invited.  The only way I even found out was I heard Ron and Fez talking about it.  This is too, this plays right into what we're all about.  Is it going on right now?  It was, it's today.  Yeah.  But do you know how much fun we could have had with a psychic and these other douchebags they have down there?  Oh, of course.  But look.  Why would you mention that?  Would we go?  Who knows?  But at least invite us.  Can you invite us?  At least invite us.  Employees, I would hope we'd be appreciated.  Obviously we're not.  They're having a huge carnival down there in a parking lot for Employee Appreciation Day and not even a phone call. 
[03:21:30]  Not even an email.  Call someone.  Much call Elo.  That makes me laugh so hard inside.  Call Elo right now.  Get Elo on the phone.  I want to know why we weren't invited.  They hate us so much.  They were even scared to fake invite us.  Now, by the way, if anybody says it's because of the CBS thing and you have to be there to broadcast from CBS, that's not.  I don't even need to know.  I want to know.  I don't need to hear any dumb excuses. 
[03:22:00]  Why weren't they?  Because I think it's just funny on a level I can't even explain to people.  Because regardless, regardless if anything they thought would have been in the way, there should have been an invitation to this show to go down there.  Regardless, if they knew we couldn't make it, we should have had an invitation.  Maybe you guys come down after your CBS show instead of taking the whole day off.  If they're worried about that, like, you know, Ron and Fez took today, maybe they say you do the CBS show, hop on the train, come down in the afternoon, hang out.  Do the show with Ron and Fez. 
[03:22:30]  We love those guys.  We could do an Afro show.  Whatever.  It might have been a tough thing to pull off, but you at least invite us.  Invite us.  How about a fucking phoner?  Could we have done a phoner?  Do you think this show is being played at Employee Appreciation Day?  No.  Can we get Ronnie on the phone from Employee Appreciation Day down there in Washington?  Oh, I want to do that.  Please.  Someone call up Ron from Ron and Fez.  Is he there yet?  Oh, he's probably still in the hotel.  I'm sleeping there, Fez.  It starts at 5 o'clock tonight. 
[03:23:00]  Is it really all day from the parking lot?  It's all day.  Holy crap, is that classic.  You know, I was listening to Ron and Fez yesterday, and they would do, I don't know when they did that kid's day.  It was the best stuff with the kid's day.  Probably some of the funniest radio ever.  Fucking funny, man.  What do they do?  They had a little kid called Jonah Bobo.  He's a little actor.  And Lil' Lanae, who used to be on the show when they were at NEW, and she's like nine now, I guess. 
[03:23:30]  And the shit Ronnie was saying was bordering on criminal, and it was hysterical.  Hysterical funny.  I don't know how he deals with kids like that.  I couldn't possibly say that shit.  But it was funny stuff, man.  Yeah, very, very funny.  That's good.  And just by the way.  By the way, those headphones you're wearing, I think those were the ones the guests wear.  So, Lanae was wearing them when she had head lice.  Did she have head lice?  Well, she did.  Yes.  She told the story about head lice and how she had to put mayonnaise in her hair, to which Ron made an off-color jism on the head joke to a nine-year-old. 
[03:24:00]  Is Lanae cute?  Because her voice, she was the cutest-sounding kid ever.  Yeah, she got a widow's speech impediment.  I got to break in, because on the line, live from Washington, our fearless leader, Elo.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Elo, are you in D.C.?  Yeah, I'm at a staff meeting with Ron and Fez about Employee Appreciation Day right now.  How is Employee Appreciation Day going? 
[03:24:30]  Well, we're not started yet.  When does it start?  Two o'clock today.  It starts at noon with a live broadcast with Ron and Fez.  Out in the parking lot?  Out in the parking lot where it's 98 degrees.  It's a beautiful day in D.C.?  I bet you they can't wait for Ron and Fez to officially hit, so they can just tell them to go screw.  Go to hell.  They're already grooving Ron and Fez.  Go to hell.  The only reason they put up with our bullshit is because we're the only thing they have. 
[03:25:00]  That's not true.  You know, in the stock market, it's called diversifying your portfolio.  Oh, right.  Yeah, we're Enron.  XM Employee Appreciation Day will start at 2 p.m.  This is the official email that was sent out to everyone except me, and I read corporate email like it's whatever.  We will have activity on the main stage all day, and there will be games, food, giveaways, and raffles.  Games, food, giveaway, raffles all day long. 
[03:25:30]  Elo, I've got to ask you the obvious question.  Why were we not invited to Employee Appreciation Day?  A lot of complications with the joint broadcast.  We haven't done our first one yet with you and CBS, so it took us an opportunity to have Ron and Fez come home for the first time here to D.C.  Look, look, look.  I don't care about why we couldn't be there, even if there was 100% chance.  The invite.  That was a good answer.  Elo, why didn't we get an invite?  We could have hopped on a 10.30 train and been down there by 2.30. 
[03:26:00]  Listen, you guys have an invite.  That's why you got the email.  We didn't have an invite.  Where's my invite?  Elo.  Well, Anthony, you said yesterday, point blank, that you don't read your other email.  Hold on.  There's 12 other guys around here that do.  Elo, I would love to help you out today, but I swear to you I did not get an invite on my BlackBerry.  No.  You guys down in Washington make this way too easy for us.  You're right.  Way too.  I can't defend that one.  Do you understand not getting an invite to employee appreciation?  To employee appreciation.  That is a day to appreciate the employees of which we are. 
[03:26:30]  Do you know how bad you guys are going to get whipped now for the next hour?  To not be invited instantly puts us in the unappreciated employee column.  Us and Mark Perretto were the only ones not invited.  Yeah, was Perretto invited?  Hey, stop.  He actually interviewed for a job.  Holy crap.  I don't doubt it.  He's getting out soon, isn't he?  Who called me?  Nathaniel?  Who called me?  I don't know.  So games, food, giveaways, and raffles. 
[03:27:00]  It sounds like fun.  Just as we did last year.  What?  Are you shitting me?  I swear it says it in the email.  Look, I know we've been here longer than 12 months.  We have been here longer than a year, right?  Someone do the math real fast.  Elo.  I don't know.  And your excuse about the CBS thing is now, you know.  Null and void.  Null and void.  If you had one last year, why weren't we there last year?  How the hell did you guys pull off an Employee Appreciation Day last year without us ever  knowing about it and ever talking about it? 
[03:27:30]  Not only not invited, we didn't even hear about it.  I'm slipping in my old age.  The only reason I know about this is through Ron and Fez.  Right.  I heard about it on their show.  And we love Ron and Fez.  We listen every day.  And I am stunned we weren't invited to Employee Appreciation Day.  We sit here unappreciated.  It was a choice of the TV spot or an invite for Employee Appreciation Day.  Oh, was that it?  Hey, well.  I am so disappointed. 
[03:28:00]  Just as we did last year, we will be selling grab bags.  Yeah, we will be selling grab bags and raffle tickets for $5 each with all proceeds benefiting  the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington.  That's a great cause.  Grab bags will contain items donated by our partners, such as shirts, hats, et cetera.  Raffle prizes include round-trip airline tickets, weekend car rentals, baseball tickets, et cetera.  The raffle drawing will be held at 4.30, and you must be present to win.  This is a great idea.  You know what the tactic is? 
[03:28:30]  Here was a mistake.  This was the I know there's not a chance in hell that you'd come down anyway.  It's just I don't get credit for making the invite.  I assumed the answer was going to be no.  We need the invite.  Do you know how much fun we could have had with the dreck that XM has lined up for this day?  Holy dreck.  Do you know how much fun we could have had teasing?  That's why they didn't want us there, because they knew that we would just shit on everything  and wreck everybody's day.  And there's so many people down there that hate our guts, they don't want to see our faces 
[03:29:00]  on employee appreciation.  That's not true.  It certainly is.  That's not true.  Are you guys going to be having potato sack races?  It's three-legged races.  Oh, you're going to do the three-legged race?  Wow.  So what do you have, Heather Mills in a mirror?  Well, here's some of the activities, Anthony.  All right.  Some activities.  You know, I know for a fact down there in Washington, they just wish we wouldn't bitch as much,  but you guys make it way too easy. 
[03:29:30]  I never said that.  I love the attention.  Indy Racing League will be bringing out the two-seater ride again this year.  There will be 10-minute massages given throughout the day.  Wow.  10-minute private lessons with golf pros from the PGA.  Yeah, I had a couple of my buddies come.  Oh, that would have been nice, huh?  A free Pilates class.  They're going to be doing Pilates in the park a lot.  D-Lo's going to be giving haircuts.  Well, there you go.  All employees. 
[03:30:00]  All right, let me see.  It's a real non-event.  Appreciation.  It's really not that big of a deal.  Non-event.  It's making it sound like the biggest deal ever.  Wow, I was just not on this list.  It says to XM Radio Programming from Trinity.  I swear to God I did not get this.  I would not lie to you.  No one here did.  Yeah.  All right, it's fine.  Raffles.  I assumed you were on the list.  That's my fault.  Miss Hot Import Nights 2005. 
[03:30:30]  Ursula Mays.  By the way, Anthony, I got a slogan for employee appreciation.  I want to hear the slogans and some events for listeners.  It's not really a slogan, but it's a big thank you.  A big thank you to all of our XM employees for making XM the number one satellite radio service.  This day is for you.  For you.  Everyone but you guys. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, because all the other on-air people on the platform are talking about the new technology as much as we are.  Elo.  Yes, buddy.  Is there any other show that is not at employee appreciation day?  Yes, there is.  There's a lot of other people from New York.  All the shows from that.  Were they invited?  A couple of the shows from L.A.  Of course.  L.A., of course.  But were they invited?  Were they invited?  Well, that is a different question now, isn't it? 
[03:31:30]  This is the best.  Any other high-profile shows that weren't invited?  I can't.  None to my not.  I didn't invite Cal Ripken or Mike Krzyzewski or James Carville or Luke Ruster.  I didn't invite any of those guys.  I can't stress.  Bob Edwards.  We're going to work out of there.  I can't stress to our listeners out there that get frustrated by our bitching how easy they make it.  You know what?  It's not like we're –  Hey, listen.  Honestly, there's a lot of times I think we could debate whether or not the bitching is right or wrong.  And there's times where I just got to bend over and just take it up the ass. 
[03:32:00]  Yep.  Right now.  You know, it's not like we're pulling back like ten layers to finally find something to bitch about.  This is just right in our face.  No, this is –  I pride myself on making sure I don't give you large sticks to hit me with.  This is so ridiculous, I'm not even mad.  I'm not even mad.  And by the way, I'm – I can't say anything.  I just get a laugh.  I go, yep, yep, I thought they had the email.  By the way, that's our new studio money.  Tell the employees that's what they get paid for. 
[03:32:30]  And say, cancel Appreciation Day and use that money to build our big studio.  Zoltec from Philly says, part of Employee Appreciation Day, they have a dart throwing contest and they use Opie and Anthony posters.  Maybe that's why we weren't invited.  They've got fancy graphics and everything for this.  Wow, I know.  Look at all this info coming in.  Schedule of events.  We had a sign made for Ron and Faz and everything. 
[03:33:00]  You guys even have the mascot from the Baltimore Orioles coming over.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Look – okay, those are the partners.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hey, what is the Indy Racing League bringing out the two-seater ride again?  What time?  What is it?  Oh, it's just a souped-up go-kart where they drive you around the block in this neighborhood and they try shooting at you and you have to outrun the bullets.  That doesn't sound like fun at all. 
[03:33:30]  I wouldn't have liked to have jumped into one of these Indy Racing League things and driven around.  That sounds kind of stupid and not fun.  It is stupid.  That's why I didn't think you'd like it.  Yeah.  That's why we didn't get invited.  Actually, I'm trying to figure out how we can take his car out, but he's here, so.  At every turn.  At every turn.  I know.  We are just forgotten.  Listen, I'm a zero.  I bring nothing to the table.  No, you are – you're nicely taking the bullet and being fun and good-natured about what is the underlying rotting corpse of people who hate our guts. 
[03:34:00]  Right now, you know what you are?  You're the perfume that The Undertaker sprays on the corpse.  Brian from New York City knows a little bit about the rides.  He says there's a giant inflatable XM stock slide. 
[03:34:30]  Brian, bingo.  Oh, that has to hurt.  At what point does it go out of bounds?  Hey, I didn't get any options in my contract.  Hey, is there the – I want to go on the Bob Edwards ride.  Do they have the Bob Edwards ride?  It's just you get in a coffin and they drag you around the parking lot while three people look at you.  No, no, it's the Bob Edwards haunted house. 
[03:35:00]  They just lead him through the studio as he's doing his show.  And now, as I said on NPR, what are the Democrats doing to win the midterm elections?  Shoot this fucker.  Opie and Anthony couldn't eat my shit.  Listen, here, give me 24 hours.  I'm going to make this up to you in a way you can't even imagine.  Okay, how's that? 
[03:35:30]  24 hours.  That's all I need.  Huh?  That's it?  I realized, listen, that we screwed up 24 hours.  I will make this up to all three of you in spades.  Wait, is this making up for the 2005 one that we weren't invited to?  Yeah, which one are you making up for?  Yeah.  I'm making it up for the 2005 one, Jimmy.  Wait, what about, when's Metallica doing their Artist Confidential?  I don't know.  I hear the announcer in the background getting ready for it.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, the people are saying you can hear it sounds like Woodstock back there. 
[03:36:00]  It's not today or anything.  Don't worry, you're fine.  Right now, this sounds like the background when the rape is being committed and sudden impact under the, under the, we're missing balloon animals today.  Okay.  Listen, Ryan, I hate to keep running for the waiting, really.  I mean, they are the star of the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll have Ronnie call our show, please.  We know you're busy.  I'll have them call.  And here's, give me 24 hours.  I'm going to make this up to all three of you like you won't believe me.  All right.  Quick question.  When people are broadcasting, are they on a stage where it's going to be heard by the employees? 
[03:36:30]  Uh, that is, there you go.  By the way, that was correct, so that's why.  They really want our nonsense being heard by everybody.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Because it's going to be broadcast all over the parking lot and everything.  And to have the likes of this shit going over the air over there, it just insults people.  Or even though it wouldn't have started by the time we were there, we certainly wouldn't have stuck around for it.  No.  But I might have hung out for an hour or two to watch.  Of course.  You can't even be mad.  You can't even be mad. 
[03:37:00]  You know where the most people sign up to have our channel blocked?  At XM.  I'm sure if you pinpointed it, it would be there at XM.  They fucking hate our guts.  Oh, did they hate, not even an invite.  How did they keep this away from us last year?  It was so on purpose.  Yeah, last year, how did they?  They must have, like, waited for us to hand in our vacation day.  Yeah, and that's when it's going to be.  And then they had the out, like, oh, we would have invited you, but you guys, you know, put in for vacation, you know, that day. 
[03:37:30]  Like, how did we not know about this last year?  Is this true they got a Bruce Kelly hog flume ride where you ride down Bruce Kelly's hog?  Let's see.  I understand there's, like, a kid's game where they have, it's almost like an Easter egg thing, and it's called Find the Marketing.  And you have to lift up all these things and see if you can find Opie and Anthony ads. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, they're all conga lining inside the building.  They're going to play.  Big party.  I'll try one.  They're going to play pin the tail on the lawsuit.  Woo!  Here we go.  Yeah.  Hey!  Welcome, everybody.  Welcome to XM Employee Appreciation Day.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the opening ceremonies of the XM Employee Appreciation Day. 
[03:38:30]  Woo!  Woo, everybody!  Come on!  This who's not here today.  That's it.  Woo-hoo!  No, no, don't worry.  You won't bump into Opie or Anthony or Jimmy or any.  They haven't been invited again!  Celebrate!  Yeah!  Let's bring all the other employees up that we do appreciate.  Let's start with some jumping jacks, people.  Everybody!  Everybody!  All the traffic people will probably do funny jokes around the go-kart ride. 
[03:39:00]  The mad Mexicans throwing a frisbee to his stupid dog out in the lot.  I'm sure he brought the piñata, of course.  And, of course, he brought the dog.  Hopefully, he's throwing a frisbee and it goes over the fence right onto that street.  And the little rascal runs out to grab it.  And a stolen SUV slams into it.  That would spoil everyone's appreciation. 
[03:39:30]  Oh!  Let's be honest.  I'm not as brave as you people think.  So my joke, which will get a huge laugh, I have to just show them.  Oh!  I'm not this brave to actually say this on the air.  There's no cameras, right?  Huh?  Uh-oh.  This is the joke of the day, but I, you know.  And it would be my last joke on XM.  I just want to prove to you asses how funny I really am.  Ready?  Let me see.  Well, yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Okay.  No, that's almost get-away-withable.  I'm not doing anything.  Yeah, you poke it and vellum and it's fallout.  Holy cow!  Are you insane?  Guys, sometimes we've got to do one just for the room.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And trust me, it would get a huge response.  Probably from the wrong people, though.  People are suggesting that if we...  So I'm going to tuck that one in my pocket.  If we did call in, all we'd hear are people going,  Shh, shh, we're quite open. 
[03:40:30]  We can't have anything around.  Shh.  Shh.  Trying to make it sound like it's not a party.  All right.  They should have had you three broadcast from a dunk tank.  Yeah, great.  Yeah.  Wacky bit.  They're beating your effigies right now.  Do you know how funny we've been to get that awful psychic in  and fucking make fun of her or him and these dumb things they have set up?  Lee Abrams mustache rides.  I'll change the joke to the Opie and Anthony pinatas.  Yeah, there you go. 
[03:41:00]  Because they would bash the pinatas pretty hard.  Wow.  All right, we've got to take a break.  I want to be invited to Employee Appreciation Day.  Can you play the Hulk music as we go to break?  Yeah, because it's, uh, hope XM people have enjoyed having us.  Man, they're just grooming Ron and Fast.  Because they're a lot less, a lot less trouble.  Well, they know, you know, that we kind of, you know, we, uh... 
[03:41:30]  We get under people's skin.  We get under people's skin.  We have a plan B.  Uh...  Yeah, it's nice to have a plan B.  It's nice to have a lifeboat.  Oh, that's the post theme.  Right next to this one.  Yeah, I'll miss him too.  There it is.  We're not feeling too good about ourselves today.  Festivities and joy, happiness going on in the parking lot of XM down there in D.C. 
[03:42:00]  as we sit here uninvited to Employee Appreciation Day.  Imagine what we're missing.  Cotton candy.  Balloon animals.  Maybe some kind of face paint.  Horses on stilts.  Face painting booth.  Caricatures being drawn.  We could have all three of us had caricatures of ourselves drawn all together.  Little bodies and big heads.  With like a microphone in front of us.  Yeah.  And those shitheads written on top.  And maybe everyone has devil horns on because we're devilishly delicious. 
[03:42:30]  We're so devilish.  You know, if it was just a party, if it was just XM's throwing an XM party, it would be one thing.  The fact of the matter is, it's Employee Appreciation Day.  Do you understand?  It's a day set aside for XM management and just the entity that is XM to appreciate the employees that are making XM what it is. 
[03:43:00]  It's a day to put all your differences aside.  It's the day where you as the employee can make fun of the boss a little.  You're at one with the management.  Yeah, exactly.  You are on the same level.  They appreciate you on that day.  You're clinking beer mugs and doing shots in the parking lot.  How much shit you take all year.  They deep down realize, hey, you're the people that make this work.  We appreciate you.  Yet, Opie, we sit here hundreds of miles away from the festivities with nary an invite to this grand event. 
[03:43:30]  Because we are not appreciated.  And that's the only reason.  We're hated.  We are not only not appreciated.  Yes, Jimmy.  Hated.  Is it too late to get one of our pests to get a real big box of marbles and just start throwing it around the parking lot?  Well, how about, are there any pests down there that would stand outside and hold up? 
[03:44:00]  Can we do an assault on the XM media?  Please.  With Opie and Anthony signs.  If you're in D.C., around that compound, hold up signs.  What about ONA?  Where are ONA?  You don't appreciate ONA.  Well, did you get the invite?  They actually do have a party.  It's called the Get a Brain Tumor and Die Party, which we all did get an invite to.  They were more than happy to ask us.  More than happy to ask us to that.  All right.  Oh, we sound like the fat girl in the basement on prom night. 
[03:44:30]  Yes, you're right.  This was a big event.  Not even an invite, and I swear to you, I'm not playing it for the radio.  Oh, my God.  Nothing.  And it definitely went out to all programming, so there's a way of adjusting that programming  email to make sure certain people don't get it.  Ask Ben and Steve, because Ben and Steve get all the ones you guys get, pretty much.  So why don't we ask Ben and Steve?  I mean, Ben would have read it, because Ben reads them all, and Steve reads most of them,  I think.  So maybe they got it.  I don't think that we got it. 
[03:45:00]  Sherry.  XM Employee Appreciation Day.  Okay, I got this one.  This is the first one I'm getting now from, oh, okay.  So this is an employee down there that didn't block my email.  The other one I was definitely blocked from.  It's obvious now.  More info on the event.  On the main stage, 3 o'clock, Jimmy Ha Ha from Jimmy's Chicken Shack.  They got a DJ.  Whoa, whoa, Jimmy Ha Ha from Jimmy's Chicken Shack?  Is that one of the sponsors? 
[03:45:30]  There's Jimmy's Chicken Shack has AIDS in the chicken.  There's AIDS in the chicken of Jimmy's Chicken Shack.  They stick the drum stitch in their assholes in Jimmy's Chicken Shack.  Ha Ha Ha Ha.  Jimmy's Chicken Shack sucks a bag of dog dicks.  Ha Ha Ha Ha.  And we're getting this coming in from the, this ass sent this to the, 
[03:46:00]  the entire XM radio programming staff.  We were talking about corporate email yesterday.  Yeah.  What?  Oh.  Get the one about the iPod charger.  Yeah, this is, this was sent to the entire XM radio programming.  All right.  Which means everybody.  Everybody.  Does anyone have an iPod charger?  Thanks.  Fired.  Thanks, B.  Whoever B is.  We're not lucky enough to know who B is.  We need his real name.  Oh, now I know why we weren't invited.  You know who the only people are that are invited?  Who? 
[03:46:30]  Goddamn rich cunt.  By the way, I stand corrected.  Jimmy's Chicken Shack is a band.  I had no idea.  I kind of knew that, but I figured.  The same thing.  I figured you're on a roll.  Let him go.  I didn't know any of that.  It was too good.  Steve, the producer of the Bob Edwards show has just sent a corporate email to everybody  that works at XM.  Uh-huh.  It simply says, does anyone have Goodfellas on DVD or VHS that I could borrow?  And he sent another one.  Can somebody remove the garlic from the studio entrance?  Bob can't get in. 
[03:47:00]  Does anyone have a wooden spike?  Does anybody have Transylvanian dirt?  Bob is tuckered out.  And Bob sent one out.  Can someone comb my hair?  I can't see it in the mirror.  Please, don't call me until after six.  I'll be a bat. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, wow.  This is too good.  We are just shit.  Oh, we are hated.  I hope someone gets fired.  Oh, someone's suggesting.  No one's going to get fired.  They don't care.  No one's been fired over the lack of fucking promotion.  No one's going to be fired over that.  Someone's suggesting we crop dust the parking lot with AIDS.  I wish we had something we could crop dust.  I mean, that's probably a terrorist act in D.C. 
[03:48:00]  Of course it is.  You can't do it.  What are you, insane?  Is it wrong if I encourage listeners with crop dusters to drop feces on the party?  I say we just open up the back gate of the compound and let all the shwuggies in.  Let the real neighborhood in.  Yeah.  Yo, man, this is a party?  Well, we should just drive by and hang up really racist signs on the fence.  It's free woody melons and put an arrow pointing in.  Well, the compound is in the ghetto just so you can play along at home.  You hang outside so they're all partying inside while an angry gang of blacks gathers ready to beat the racists. 
[03:48:30]  Just put no parking signs all over the meter saying no parking today.  Ku Klux Klan meeting going on.  Whites only.  Appreciation day.  Whites only parking.  White parking.  No spades allowed.  That's right.  A celebration of gentrification.  And then put the arrow pointing in.  Lucky Texan is going. 
[03:49:00]  He goes, still can't figure out why you're not invited.  We want to be invited to the party.  We want an invite.  We want it both ways.  I know that doesn't make sense, but we want to be able to trash them until it hurts and also be appreciated.  Wow.  That is just too good.  I can't wait to talk to Ronnie.  Get Ron from Ron and Fez on the phone.  Wow.  Do you honestly think that if CBS had an employee appreciation day that we wouldn't be invited? 
[03:49:30]  Oh, my God.  Let's go the other way, the other satellite company.  Right.  Do you think if Howard Stern, do you think Howard would get an invite to the serious employee appreciation day?  Of course he would.  Dude, these emails, they've got to be playing with us now.  Just rubbing it in.  Are they rubbing it in?  I don't know, but I get these every day.  Another corporate email.  It goes to XM Radio Programming. 
[03:50:00]  That means everyone that has a blackbird.  Everyone.  And an XM email address.  I swear to you, it's from someone named Kate.  Does anyone have a stopwatch I could borrow this afternoon?  This is why Anthony doesn't read his email, by the way.  Yeah.  You can't be bothered with this crap.  Why is Kate?  What's the matter?  She's probably timing her shits.  She's a dominatrix.  Someone's complaining her logs are too short.  To kick Kate right in the asshole.  Plant my sneaker right in that dumper of hers. 
[03:50:30]  All right, we better take it.  Someone said we should put a big sign over the gate, work equals freedom.  With a picture of a $5 bill and an arrow pointing at Lincoln and just says criminal.  Meddler.  Wait, are you sure that they're not fucking with us?  What?  This is not just a goof to smash the whole show.  This is a pretty elaborate goof with Ron and Fez going there.  Maybe they had to go for stuff.  Nah, they've been talking about this raffle. 
[03:51:00]  I mean, and it just, it's so legit.  You think they're pulling a really good prank on us?  No.  No, there is a employee appreciation day that we're invited to.  ONA, the Nix Marie of the XM Nation.  How many hours before we get to go back to the other place? 
[03:51:30]  20 hours from right now?  Our good friends.  All right, we'll take a break.  Maybe they're just teasing us.  No.  No.  No.  No, I think, guys, here's what I think.  It's a joke.  They just, they would not do that.  Really?  Yeah, they wouldn't.  They wouldn't throw us under the roof.  Oh, man, if you guys only knew how funny this is after the phone call I had a deal with  last night.  This is just a big joke.  They're playing a joke on us.  If you only knew. 
[03:52:00]  Someone made a good suggestion.  Call up Ronnie when they're broadcasting.  I think I'm going to do this on my drive home.  Call up Ronnie.  Have him crank it up for the parking lot.  And then just yell out how much of cunts they are.  And to go fuck themselves.  XM, go fuck yourself.  Can we get that cute viral thing that went out a few years ago where it's the kittens?  The bus is a cunt. 
[03:52:30]  Remember that one?  Yeah.  Or how about this?  You make them turn the speakers up and you call in and you just start yelling,  All blacks, please leave the neighborhood.  You're not welcome here.  And then watch that compound be overthrown and removed.  All right.  Can I have a kiss?  Yeah.  Well, I guess.  After spots.  Does anyone even feel like working anymore today? 
[03:53:00]  Oh, I know.  Now I'm just disgusted.  Knowing there's no appreciation whatsoever.  No appreciation.  Uh, Leah, let's just all remember Earl is there.  Right.  At, uh, the, uh, Employee Appreciation Day.  Right?  Right.  Isn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  After the break, we'll show you how shitty of a radio show we could give you.  Oh, they know.  How you doing?  This is Club Soda Kenny.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, which ain't that bad.  Opie and Anthony.  Time for the Roto-Wire Fantasy Football Minute. 
[03:53:30]  Hi, this is Chris List of rotowire.com, talking with Mike Salfino.  And, Mike, if Tim were taken, light you up like that, you know, is there any danger for this team,  even though they have home field in the NFC playoffs?  Do you think the Bears are going to come out of the NFC right now?  You know, I can't really figure out the NFC.  What I'm becoming convinced of is that the worst team that's going to qualify for the AFC playoffs  is going to be better than the best team in the NFC.  Since week seven, the AFC in inter-conference games are 30-9, 
[03:54:00]  and the point differential in those games is 350 points.  So if you have two teams that are kind of ranked similarly statistically,  and they're playing an inter-conference game,  you could rationalize saying that the AFC team should still be favored by 8.5 points right now.  For the latest information to get your fantasy football team ready for Sunday,  it's the Rotowire Fantasy Football Hour.  Weekdays, 8 p.m. in the East, 5 p.m. in the West, on XM Sports Nation, Channel 143.

[03:57:30]  Obey and Anthony.  It's the worst.  Obey and Anthony.  I like my penis.  Ron and Fez.  Happy Employee Appreciation Day.  Yeah, happy Employee Appreciation Day to you, Fezzy.  Where are you guys?  Where are you?  We want to appreciate you.  Well.  All right.  Don't rub it in.  We're here in New York.  Totally rubbing it in.  We are in New York.  We never even heard of this. 
[03:58:00]  I heard.  You didn't know it was Employee Appreciation Day?  I heard on your show right before you left that this was going on, and no invite, nothing.  Ah.  Nothing got lost in the mail.  In the email?  It didn't get lost in the mail.  We are not appreciated.  We are not appreciated employees, and that is why.  We found out they had one last year.  And do you know something?  When we found that out? 
[03:58:30]  Today.  Really?  And we weren't invited to that one either.  Well, Ronnie and I are in Northeast D.C., and I think if we got any more appreciated, we'd be dead by now.  Oh, have you just, like, been getting all the pats on the back?  And is this your first trip down there to D.C.?  Yeah, since starting the show, yep.  Since starting the show, your first trip down, have you met all the big brass and everybody?  They took you around the tour of the compound, and have people been going, hey, Ron and Fez love the show. 
[03:59:00]  You guys are doing a great job, all that horse shit.  Actually, we're just pulling into the compound now.  They've got us in the back of an armored car.  Hang on.  I'm going to put Roddy out with you.  All right.  Listen to the sarcasm here, man.  Hey, boys, where are you?  Yeah, Ronnie, we're in New York in the studio.  No invite.  We didn't even hear about this. 
[03:59:30]  Elo was trying to tell us we weren't invited because of the CBS thing.  He wouldn't know if we could have off, blah, blah, blah.  But you want the invite.  You are missing it.  Steaks, lobsters, coke, hookers.  It's amazing.  Coke and hookers.  It's unbelievable.  Well, it's the only day where the bosses look the other way.  So, you know, the coke and the whores are on their way.  Are you feeling appreciated?  I'm getting my dick sucked right now.  It's unbelievable. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, is that why Fez had to put the phone down?  Oh, see?  You see, it always goes back to that, doesn't it?  It always does.  It always does.  It always does.  Now, why do you guys have three days off for a one-day appreciation day?  I have no idea.  I'm not paying any attention whatsoever.  Right now, we're just outside of where the compound is.  And we're having Earl run into crowds, and then we play Where's Waldo with him. 
[04:00:30]  Really, really tough.  That sounds fun.  You guys weren't even invited to this?  We didn't even hear about it.  We didn't hear about it.  No invitation, nothing.  Yeah, well.  It is.  And since it's Employee Appreciation Day, we see it as us being completely unappreciated and hated  because we weren't even invited.  I'm picking up on that vibe here.  I'm picking up on the vibe that since you guys did the CBS deal, everything has changed. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, everything's changed.  We're not the boys anymore.  I think you guys went up a few notches, which, you know, whatever you guys get, God bless, I say.  But I feel us being unappreciated like this is an insult.  Some of the locals down here call you guys the terrestrials.  What are the terrestrials doing?  How's Opie and his antenna?  And I'm like, look. 
[04:01:30]  It has nothing to do with any of that.  It has nothing to do with that.  No, no.  Are you guys going to the compound the back way or through the front door?  Because the back way to the compound is an experience that shouldn't be missed while you're down there.  All right.  Earl, he wants to take us through the back way.  So to get through, like, the guards and shit?  No, I mean the drive.  How did you drive in?  Yeah, I don't know how close you are.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We came in through the back way.  Yeah, you go through a few neighborhoods where you might, you know, buck, buck, hear a few shots going off, a few sideways turned guns. 
[04:02:00]  One of our best stories as far as going down there, Megan picks us up from the hotel.  We're broadcasting live down there.  We're going to the compound.  It's early in the morning.  You have to go right through the ghetto.  And one of the worst ghettos in the whole area just to get to the compound because, obviously, real estate was cheap when they were putting this whole thing together.  And we're in the big XM van.  And all of a sudden, I forget who, but someone goes, oh, my God, there's a shooting going on.  Megan goes where and jams on the brakes. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, to stop, like rubbernecking an accident.  Anyone else would, like, step on it.  She says where and steps on the brake.  And speaking of the van, are you riding in the freshly painted Ron and Fez van?  Yeah.  They are.  I don't know what it is.  They just kind of, like, we look thinner in these pictures.  They just put our eyes and nose over your pictures.  Yeah.  Well, we did actually see a shooting on our way to work that morning. 
[04:03:00]  And the police had their guns drawn.  They were behind their doors just facing some kind of establishment.  That's the nice neighborhood.  I know.  I mean, it's so scary here, I almost dropped my crack.  It's really fucking frightening.  I couldn't feel more comfortable than if I was in a neighborhood like this.  This is where I feel at home.  I do believe Ronnie has no problem talking to the locals, if you know what I mean.  No, just to get through.  Yeah, I would love to maybe give a call later so you could turn the speaker. 
[04:03:30]  Are you broadcasting from the parking lot?  Yeah.  We're just walking into it now.  And it looks like when they set up a mall.  You know, just in the – it's very odd.  Yeah.  There's Snoop Dogg.  There's Alan.  Everybody's here.  Oh, they're all there.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, except –  It's Oprah.  Oprah.  Except for Anthony.  I can't believe you guys aren't here.  Not even invited.  You would think XM would just kind of roam the neighborhood and find an Oprah lookalike for the appreciation day. 
[04:04:00]  Hey, you'll do, but I'm a man.  It doesn't matter.  All right, guys.  Well, have fun at employee appreciation day that we weren't invited to.  And I'm sorry.  I hope you guys' feelings aren't hurt.  Maybe after – maybe you can go cry on a huge bag of money.  I don't know how we can make this up to you.  Talk to you later, boys.  All right, Ronnie.  Take it easy. 
[04:04:30]  All right, Fez.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, can't – people are saying here on Instant Feedback, Opie, can't you send a corporate email to everybody?  You certainly can.  So send one.  And what do you want me to write?  Thanks for the invite, motherfucker.  No, you can't curse, but –  Hold on.  From Opie.  From the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show?  Yes.  Who gives –  No, you should write something that we are hurt. 
[04:05:00]  Shit.  Yeah.  About your witty –  No.  Quote.  Can't curse.  But will everyone get that?  Yes.  The day.  Then put like –  Die, fucker.  Then put –  Die.  Does anyone have a robe and some broth?  How about this?  The Opie and Anthony show.  We are hurt by the lack of appreciation for the fact that we are carrying this awful company on our backs. 
[04:05:30]  Please send that just to everybody.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  But we are sick.  Are we in agreement?  Who gives a shit about your witty quote of the day?  Die, fucker, die.  No, we're not.  No, no, no.  No, don't curse.  Jimmy's got a good one.  If you send a curse, you might get fired.  No, then they have a reason.  You can't give them a reason.  Yeah, there it goes.  All right, but send another one. 
[04:06:00]  It's out there.  I'll just blame it on, you know, we're just doing radio.  How about this one?  Yeah, put that one.  We don't –  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony show.  We are hurt.  All right, hold on.  Hurt.  We are hurt.  We –  And saddened.  Right.  Saddened.  Yes?  By the lack of appreciation shown by the rest of this company.  Of the company, okay. 
[04:06:30]  We have been lugging the dead weight of your incompetence.  Hold on, I can't type so fast.  Okay.  On our backs.  Okay.  And it's high time.  Okay.  We were recognized for it. 
[04:07:00]  Mm-hmm.  That's it?  Um.  Wait.  I would like one more instance of us carrying them in some fashion.  Can you read that back?  Oh, plus you have that.  Let's see the floor.  Can you read that back?  I did it in shorthand so far.  Hold on.  We're hurt and saddened by the lack of – 
[04:07:30]  Is that all you got?  He was –  He was going too fast.  How about this?  Somebody –  Oh, my God.  Can somebody who can type –  I have lugging.  I have lugging.  Can we play that back?  I have saddened by the –  Play that back.  Can we get either Derek or a monkey to type it?  Yeah.  He was going too fast.  I trust the monkey.  Look how small the keyboard is.  I know.  It's very tiny.  Let's have it played back.  I want to get the wording right.  Derek's going to play it back.  That's why I liked mine. 
[04:08:00]  It was short and to the point.  Yeah, but –  Yeah, but this is –  This really, like, will upset people.  That would really be annoying.  This will –  Trust me.  That we're carrying them on our backs.  All right.  Go ahead.  Hold on.  Play it back before you get a face smashing.  Oh, boy.  I hear he's hitting the buttons.  He's trying to spell was.  By the lack of appreciation, Sean,  by the rest of this company.  Shown by the rest of this company.  Pause it. 
[04:08:30]  Wait.  Where am I at now?  The lack of appreciation.  Right.  Did you get there yet?  Are you typing it out, Dan?  Yeah.  Dan's a good boy.  All right.  Go there.  So, all this is lack of appreciation.  Shown by the lack of appreciation of this company.  Yeah.  By –  Wait.  Oh, my God.  By this company.  For this company.  For this company.  That changes the whole thing.  My God.  What a bunch of dolts.  We are hurt and saddened by the lack of appreciation.  Saddened.  Lack of appreciation.  Shown by the rest of this company. 
[04:09:00]  And E-Rock.  And fucked it up completely.  Oh, hire E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  By the lack of appreciation by this company.  Dude.  What happened?  The employee email is going nuts.  So, now there's this chick, Joyce, from Nashville.  Our Nashville office, I guess.  And not appreciating the vulgar language.  Well, it looks like she didn't get that one yet.  Uh-oh.  Subject.  Reminder.  XM Employee Appreciation Day, June 20th.  Everyone's talking about it now.  Yeah, they are. 
[04:09:30]  For those wondering, here in Nashville, we're hosting our own Employee Appreciation Day.  We didn't have the budget for entertainment or food or door prizes.  Here's what we've planned down here in Nashville.  Nashville's having their own.  Get ready for the funny.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  At dusk in the Country Music Hall of Fame studios, we'll be channeling the ghosts of Patsy, Johnny, and Waylon.  That's kind of fun.  John Anthony will be showing his injuries from his recreational hockey league. 
[04:10:00]  Cold leftovers from my husband's buffet line will be served.  I hope the ghosts show up and kill them.  A raffle for a drive around the roundabout in Kyle Cantrell's new SUV.  Lessons on how to use cuss, cuss words in a country song from Marty Fitzpatrick.  Stress management courses from Ashley Garman.  She's good.  And massages from Natalie, the intern.  Wish you all could be here.  Yeah, see, I guess they couldn't make it. 
[04:10:30]  So they're doing their own.  So they're doing their own, but it's kind of a joke thing.  Yeah.  Let's get this email sent out.  This is, dude, trust me.  This is really going to bug them.  This will bother them.  This will bug them.  All right, go ahead.  What do you have so far, Opie?  Seriously.  No, he's typing now.  I'm reading.  He's typing.  But you can't send it.  Okay, give me the whole thing.  Read it.  Play it back from the beginning.  Before I go in there and...  So far we got, we are hurt and saddened by the lack of appreciation shown by this company.  By the lack of appreciation, okay, shown by this company.

So either show us due respect or all of this brand new computer equipment that you bought  us that we have just lying around. 
[04:16:00]  Currently, the Opie and Anthony radio empire as heard on numerous CBS radio stations.  I think that is exactly what should be sent out to everyone.  Perfect.  And here it goes.  Send to everybody.  Very good.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Yeah, what the fuck?  That's the way to do it. 
[04:16:30]  Kirtly.  I have never heard that actually used in a letter.  I haven't either.  Kirtly.  Kirtly.  But it really fit.  Good work, Jimmy.  Thanks.  That was a team effort.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come.  We'll be in the country.  Here we go.  What the fuck is that?

For Michigan, keep an eye out for tailback Mike Hart and wideout Mario Manningham.  Also on the defensive side of the ball, Lamar Woodley, who will look to wreak havoc from the defensive end.  Now for USC, it's quarterback John David Booty, who I call the assassin, and has made targets Dwayne Jarrett and Steve Smith.

It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony?  Yes?  What did your brother get you for Christmas?  I stopped you.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Yes, a wonderful gift for me.  It's the perfect present.  I'm going to start my collection.  Gloves that no germs can go through? 
[04:22:30]  No, that would be good, though.  That would really be good.  He got me an old World War II English rifle.  It's wonderful.  It's 1938, just a kraut killer, complete with a bayonet.  It's an Enfield.  Very nice.  And the thing is so heavy.  It's made of wood, and it's got like a butt plate with metal on it that is just made for smashing Nazi teeth in with. 
[04:23:00]  Great action on it, and it's a collector's item, but could still fire it.  And now I'm looking to pick up a German Mauser from the same era, and an M1 Garand, the American, you know.  You could display it all nice, right?  And then when I get my pistol license, which I'm going for, I've got about a four-month wait, then I could start the pistol collection. 
[04:23:30]  It's going to be wonderful.  You're turning into one of those guys.  I am one of those guys, because let me tell you another gift I got that I will cherish.  My uncle got me one of the banners, flags, that the SS used to have on the front of their staff cars.  It's got the skull and the lightning bolts on it.  Wonderful.  I just love the era.  I love that whole World War II era.  You're telling yourself that's what it is you love. 
[04:24:00]  I like the memorabilia from it.  I like the weapons.  I like the clothing.  That's great stuff.  Just say it.  The ideology.  You'll love the ideology.  It's also obvious to mention the ideology.  The clothing.  I love the weapons.  I love the message.  I love the message.  It's also obvious what you hate.  It's also obvious what you hate at this point.  I didn't say anything about that.  Just because I appreciate the era and the weaponry.  And the German army was very snazzy, snappy dressers. 
[04:24:30]  And I happened to pick up a leather coat that is very similar to an officer's jacket.  They photoshopped it with some patches on the sleeves that look very bad.  Do you know you're just going to wake up one night and walk out and just see you at three  in the morning in the living room in the dark shadows, dressed like a Nazi, looking at  yourself in the mirror.  It's just going to go, what are you doing?  And you're going to go, I don't know.  Can you help me?  You're a fucking, you're losing your mind.  Gunna?  Did you say gunna? 
[04:25:00]  I don't know.  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  All right, listen.  I am the furthest thing from an Aryan.  Yeah, sure.  You're losing your mind, Anthony.  It's frightening.  It's great, though.  All guns.  We'll ride it to the end, though, man.  We'll be doing a show.  He's not even going to know where he is anymore, but we'll continue.  He'll be fucking barricaded inside his fucking house, firing at police officers, yelling,  germ pigs, germ pigs, in between doing radio. 
[04:25:30]  That's what he's going to be doing during the commercials.  He's not even going to come into the studio anymore.  How could anyone?  He's going to be one of those radio guys that has to do the show from home.  How could anyone not appreciate it?  For what reason, we don't know, but we just go with it.  How could anyone not appreciate the era, what was going on back then, the weaponry,  the collector's items of World War II?  That's what I am attracted to.  This Enfield rifle, there's a history there.  I picked it up.  I put it to my shoulder and looked down the site, and I was like, what was seen through 
[04:26:00]  this site over the years, you know, back in 1939, 1940, you know?  Get yourself a look at glass.  Why don't you get yourself a telescope and look at the stars and say, I wonder if anybody  looked at the stars in the 40s.  Why don't you get yourself a book?  Get a kaleidoscope.  Get a kaleidoscope.  That's a lot safer for everyone.  When I snapped that bayonet on, I was thinking, did anyone get run through with this thing? 
[04:26:30]  Was it used on some Nazi somewhere?  How about baseball cards?  Why don't you collect them?  I did as a kid.  As I grow, my tastes in collectibles changed.  And now, it is World War II memorabilia.  I want a German Mauser.  I want an M1 Garand rifle.  And then perhaps I'll delve into things like the old grease gun.  Yeah, the grease gun. 
[04:27:00]  What a noodle.  Nazi.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate.  Hey, come on, dude.  Hi, Nate.  Hey, Anthony.  I was wondering, have you ever been in an Army Navy store where the guy offered you a can  as Zyklon B and then said, hey, you and me, we're really the same?  I'm just like you, man.  Just like you, man.  You and me.  No.  That was Chef from Apocalypse Now, right?  Yeah.  In Falling Down.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  No.  Take care, guys.  See, anyone who appreciates that kind of thing gets kind of labeled, you know? 
[04:27:30]  Yeah.  You get kind of labeled.  Do you know that authentic Nazi flags are really amazingly well-made things?  It's not just a flag like with printing on it.  They're wonderfully embroidered things.  I don't own any.  I'm saying that right now.  I don't own Nazi flags.  I don't have the swastika and the eagle and the iron cross.  I own none of that.  But I've seen them in museums.  And, you know, it's just a thing from that era that is wonderful to look at. 
[04:28:00]  Way to take lemons and make lemonade.  Tell you one thing, six million dead.  But, you know, all kidding aside, good crap.  I mean, what a high thread count, that flag head.  I am not downplaying the atrocities that took place during that era by many people.  So the Japanese, the Nazis, our own internment of the Japanese civilians was looked at as an atrocity. 
[04:28:30]  I just see it as, hey, who knows what these people are up to.  Perhaps they ought to be watched.  Absolutely.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Rob.  Yeah, Anthony sounds like he's about to turn in that guy from falling down.  He's going to lead like Opie into the basement.  Hey, me and you, we're the same guy.  He's the same guy.  No, I'm not that guy.  Fuck it out, guys.  Everybody hurts. 
[04:29:00]  You fuckers.  Leave my car parked on the expressway.  Just going to stop driving one day and just start walking.  Just start walking.  Why can't that be appreciated?  Why can't the German army's materials be appreciated without the ideology even coming up?  I deplore what they stood for, their actions against the Jewish people and many others. 
[04:29:30]  Because I look down upon it, that is an awful atrocity that was committed against many people.  And nothing can ever make that a good thing.  But I like their clothes.  Sure.  I'm glad you're saying that after you drop a tear watching Downfall.  You know, when Hitler had to kill his dog, for those who didn't see Downfall, it was about Hitler in the bunker.  And Anthony admitted dropping a tear for the old guy.  I never dropped a tear.  It just, for some reason, and I commented on that movie, Downfall, and said I didn't necessarily think this was a good thing. 
[04:30:00]  The movie was a German-made movie.  Yes.  It's got German subtitle.  You've got to watch it in the actual German.  Don't watch it dubbed or anything.  No, of course not.  Watch it in its native German tongue.  And it's subtitled.  And it almost humanizes the man.  You know, you see him testing out the cyanide capsules that he's going to be using and Ava is going to be using.  He's got to kill his dogs. 
[04:30:30]  So he uses it on his dog.  And as he crunches the little snout of his German Shepherd down on the cyanide and the dog lets out a little yelp and dies, Hitler's a little broken up about it.  And you look and it humanizes that guy.  And I said that is not necessarily a good thing.  Yeah, but then explain this.  When you were watching, you were thrown out of the theater, I remember, when you were watching Schindler's List for jumping up and yelling,  Goddamn, meddler!  What's the matter with you?  You meddlers. 
[04:31:00]  Wow.  Hey, why don't we talk about Pat from Anarchy?  I don't understand.  See, this is why you can't be a collector.  Collect nice things.  Yeah, exactly.  How about match...  My father used to collect...  How about you...  How about you collect Hummels?  Hummels?  Do you know where they come from?  I don't know.  Where do they come from?  It's not like I have a lampshade collection at home.  I don't.  My father used to collect Lionel trains. 
[04:31:30]  That's a nice thing to collect when you're a lad.  How about some matchbox cars?  You make good money.  There's some older, valuable ones.  What's your favorite animal?  I have...  Animal?  Yeah.  Not really a fan of the...  Besides the eagle on that flag.  The eagle is very...  You know how people have a favorite animal and then their whole house is taken over by animal things?  No.  Like my mom has...  Oh, somebody likes...  If they like pigs...  My mom...  What?  You nailed it.  Really?  My mom likes pigs, so there's a lot of pigs.  Whether they're stuffed...  Ceramic... 
[04:32:00]  It's all about the pigs.  And when she gets a new pig, is it like a big thing?  Of course it is.  Like, look what I found.  This is a 1953 steel bank pig.  That's right.  No.  My father likes unicorns.  All right.  There must be a lot of unicorns around the house.  I was just kidding.  I just wanted to say something really awful.  Well, I like World War II memorabilia.  I like Jap stuff.  German stuff.  I like Nazi memorabilia.  I like American World War II memorabilia. 
[04:32:30]  I like their gear.  I'd like an old World War II field radio.  That's another thing I'm looking for my collection.  Things like that.  It's not just like sitting around with a big Nazi flag on the wall, shaving my head, wearing Doc Martens, looking to stomp some faggots.  Those are for the weekends.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Why is Patrice drawing...  Wow.  Patrice is drawing three-dimensional slump there.  Stop sucking up.  Stop sucking up to Anthony. 
[04:33:00]  That is really nice.  I do.  It's a weird thing I do.  I just...  Good job.  Sometimes in the tub, I just...  Like when I'm cleaning the tub and I have to scrub in bubbles, I just...  Yeah.  I just draw a swastika.  Rub-a-dub-dub swastikas in the tub.  I don't know.  It's just like, you know, I draw a scrubbing bubble swastika.  I used to draw those on my sneakers.  Remember the old sneakers?  How'd you stand from there?  How could you not?  It's a fluorescent marker.  Remember the old sneakers that had the wooden, like... 
[04:33:30]  Wooden.  Wooden.  The rubber half a moon kind of thing.  Wooden sneakers.  I lived in Holland.  The rubber, like, half a moon thing over the toe area.  They're your basic sneaker.  I used to draw swastikas on those when I was, like, in first grade.  And a teacher came up to me in the playground and started yelling at me like a mad woman.  And she goes, those are swastikas. 
[04:34:00]  I went, oh, really?  And she said, do you know what those represent?  And I said, no, I don't.  She goes, why did you draw it on your sneaker?  I said, because they look cool.  And that was it.  I didn't know any ideology.  I didn't know the horror, the thing.  This teacher assumed that in first grade, I'm going to know that it is a symbol of terror and horror.  And not just a symbol that kind of looked cool to a first grader. 
[04:34:30]  What's your excuse now?  It's kind of sad.  That symbol kind of looked great.  You know, the devil-worshiping symbol is a cool thing to draw and play out with.  It's actually a Southeast Asian symbol for peace.  Yeah.  Back before the Nazis picked it up.  And the American Indians also used it as a peace-type symbol.  Hitler just was a motherfucker.  Hitler just wrecked a bunch of stuff.  The little mustache, the swastika, ruined it all.  Good thing he didn't have them go do the thumbs-up.  We wouldn't be able to do that today.  Fonzie would have been considered a racist. 
[04:35:00]  If he lived, he would have.  Hey, Jews.  If he lived, he would have destroyed the smiley face.  We gave him enough time.  Hey, Fonzie, what are you doing tonight?  Killing the Bernstein twins.  Hey.  And instead of a jukebox, he's hitting a Jew right in the head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, what is it?  Knock his yamaka off.  Yeah.  Sing, Jaime.  Instead of jumping a shark, he just throws a Jew right in with the shark. 
[04:35:30]  Yeah, he's hitting the Jew.  He jumps a Jew lawyer and calls it a shark.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Hey.  Hey.  Don't ruin our American institutions like the Fonz like that.  Hey, Bosley, you're a Jew, right?  Hey.  Hey, Bosley.  That's a Jew name, Bosley.  Bosley Steen.  Hey, you fucking Jew.  Hey. 
[04:36:00]  Hey, Arnold.  You know what he is.  Hey.  Look at that nose.  Who do you think burned down his fucking diner?  Hey.  Hey.  I'd rather have the fucking goof on it than this fucking Jew.  Hey.  Now, Vecchio, my balls.  Hey.  You ain't Italian.  You're a Jew.  You're a Jew.  I'll tell you about happy days before the Jews got here.  Hey.  Hey.  You talk about happy fucking days.  Hey. 
[04:36:30]  Whoa.  He pulls out a big stick and pretends he's going to club one of the Jews and then cones  his head with it.  And his best friend is Richie Can't Eat a Ham.  Ah.  Can't eat a ham.  You're an ass.  Richie Can't Eat a Ham.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  It's Ralph Mouth and his friend Moxie. 
[04:37:00]  Hey, Ralph.  Shoot that Jew in the face.  I still got it.  My foreskin, Fonz.  I still got it.  I still got it.  Hey, shortcake.  Shortcake.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Hey. 
[04:37:30]  There you go.  He just ripped apart the font as a racist.  Oy vey.  Oy vey.  Hold on, Fonz.  Your real name is Winkler.  Hey.  Hey.  Flip it on the QTO.  Oh.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Pat from Wynaki.  Pat.  Hey.  Hey, Pat.  Hey.  The oven doesn't work and Fonzie hits it with his fist and fires right up. 
[04:38:00]  Holy shit, Pat.  That is horrible.  It was right away.  He said it.  It got right on.  Hey, Pat.  Yes?  Did you get your van fixed?  A lot of people want to know.  All right.  Well, I've been having my eating contest lately, so I'm scheduling it.  My van sounds like a thunderstorm when I drive from the sheet metal on the roof.  Rattling.  They're all in the shower.  Nothing's happening.  Look. 
[04:38:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Oh.  All right, Pat.  All right.  Thank you.  That's funny, Pat.  This is Rich Voss.  You might recognize me if you were on the train today.  You are listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Okay, Ike.  You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel.  You spin it and see where it lands.  And you sing this song.  I have a little dreidel.  I made it out of clay.  And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. 
[04:39:00]  Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.  I made you out of clay.  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.  With dreidel I shall play.  Now you try it, Ike.  Just spin it with your fingers like this.  H-I-K-K-L-L-P.  Up the sun like all the wind.  I came down the wind and washed his fire out.  Hey, what the hell are you doing?  Oh, hey, Cartman.  We're playing dreidel. 
[04:39:30]  You want to try?  Sure.  Here's a little dreidel that's not made of clay.  But I'm not gonna play with it cause dreidel's fuckin' gay.  Hey, shut your mouth, fat ass.  Jews.  Play stupid games.  Jews.  That's why they're lame.  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.  I made you out of clay.  Play stupid games.  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.  With dreidel I shall play.  That's why they're lame.  What's going on?  Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.  It's so amazing.  You spin this thing on the ground and it goes round and round. 
[04:40:00]  I could watch it all day.  Let me try it.  I'll try to make it spin.  It fell.  I'll try again.  Oh, trade-o, trade-o, trade-o.  I made you out of clay.  Trade-o, trade-o, trade-o.  With dreidel I shall play.  Oh, trade-o, trade-o, trade-o.  I made you out of clay.  Play stupid games.  Trade-o, trade-o, trade-o.  With dreidel I shall play.  That's why they're lame.  Oh, trade-o, trade-o.  I made you out of clay.  Play stupid games.  Trade-o, trade-o, trade-o.  Stupid dreidel I shall play.  That's why they're lame.  Hello, boys. 
[04:40:30]  Hi, Mom.  Oh, how precious.  You boys are all playing dreidels.  Now you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the Hebrew people.  Yes, we know, Miss Boblosky.  It's so very interesting.  Now when you learn to make the dreidel spin,  you know our people always win.  Keep spinning more to make the dreidel spin.  The stupid king.  Our people always win.

[04:45:00]  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show Tip of the Day on XM Radio.  If your tech suggests a fuel injection cleaning, you may want to have it done.  Fuel injection cleaning is a must for proper maintenance and fuel economy on electronically fuel-injected vehicles.  Because of the nature of gasoline to leave gum and varnish deposits in the fuel system,  this dirt must be cleaned out periodically.  Not only that, but unburned gas inside the combustion chambers causes carbon deposits to build up in the engine. 
[04:45:30]  This carbon acts like a sponge in that when the air-fuel mixture is injected into the combustion chamber,  the carbon saps the fuel out of the mixture and creates a lean condition.  A lean fuel mixture results in hard, cold starting, poor performance,  and the computer trying to overcompensate for the lean condition it sees by excessively richening the fuel mixture.  Fuel system cleaning every 35,000 miles avoids this.  Got a question? Check our website at americascarshow.com.  Hear the full show on XM Channel 166, Saturdays, 2 p.m. Eastern. 
[04:46:00]  Let's get into this, Dan.  We have a bombshell right now.  Who got this audio?  Steve.  Yeah.  Steve C., everybody.  Steve was sent this audio.  Is it legit?  Certainly sounds like it.  I'm waiting for video confirmation, which should be coming.  Well, if she's going to send video confirmation.  Now, this is from Pal Talk. 
[04:46:30]  This is from Pal Talk.  And it's a woman, a young woman, old woman, what woman?  Young woman in Australia.  Young woman in Australia.  Good eye.  Good eye.  I am on Pal Talk, guy.  We're going to be throwing one of our regulars under the bus hard.  Wow.  That better be a big bus.  He's going to get thrown under the bus because apparently this woman has sent audio of a little  communication that went on between her and somebody that is known from this program. 
[04:47:00]  An exchange.  An exchange.  She's got a MySpace account.  Get that up.  Yeah, yeah.  Get that up.  Let me see.  Let me see her.  Turn that around.  Oh, Jesus.  Boxing Matilda.  Jesus.  Wow.  That looks like a...  She looks like an extra from a 1950s film.  Yeah, it's like all...  The picture's all fancy, blurred around the edges in an oval, like a locket picture.  She was the star of the pig and the pendulum. 
[04:47:30]  Wow.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  Heavy on the brow, fat in the face.  Oh, does she listen?  No.  Yeah.  What's...  I don't know what the time difference is.  Oh, that's not the right one then.  Okay, that's a different MySpace.  Hunch up the one with her.  There's not a...  Okay, now that's better.  Whew.  There's not enough...  There's not enough of a time difference to get rid of ugliness.  Oh.  What's the time difference?  Maybe it's the picture.  It doesn't matter if she hears it now or 12 hours from now. 
[04:48:00]  That might be her ass.  Why does she have hair like Anthony when you're five?  It's the same.  She has a fucking Anthony five-year-old boy hairdo.  Listen, are we going to do this or what?  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Come on.  Henry, with you with me.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have in our possession...  Can we just play it?  Will it be obvious as to who it is?  Mm-hmm.  Yes, it will.  Should we just do it that way?  Yeah.  I just hit the...  Message from Big Paul.  From Big Paul. 
[04:48:30]  From No Filter Paul saying that he's gotten 50 phone calls in total panic right now.  Why is Paul panicking?  No.  No, he has gotten 50 phone calls from somebody that is completely panicking.  It's probably fucking people that haven't gotten their merchandise.  Stop fucking listening to clip shit, Dick, and mail out a CD.  Yeah, why don't we get No Filter Paul on the phone?  This was a total setup.  Was it a setup?  Done to entertain other people in the pal talk room. 
[04:49:00]  Because at one point, she begins to crack up.  Indeed.  Without further ado, we present...  Oh, we shouldn't say who it is?  I would play it.  Okay.  I haven't heard it.  All right.  It's Blaze Angel.  It's from Australia, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll just play the first clip here.  So, you want to play 30 with you here in the room with me?  You want to take a big talk for me so if I can mind for you and make it count? 
[04:49:30]  Is that it?  Is that what you want?  Oh, my God.  Jeepers.  Jeepers.  I wonder who that is.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[04:50:00]  Boy, there ain't no hiding that, is there?  No.  Wow, I gotta back up. Here we go. She asked a question. Here we go.  What's up here with you?  Yeah, sounds like fun to me. Why don't you cam up and show me what you've got.  Cam up. So asking for him to cam up. Is that the last of the clip?  Oh yeah, yeah. No, I know. Some of these are about 30 seconds. 
[04:50:30]  He goes, why don't you cam up, right? Okay. Does he cam up? Oh yeah.  Oh no! Oh yeah.  Damn, I wish I was there right now. I'd be on my knees between your legs giving it a little fuck.  Just what I need. Would you like that if I did that for you?  If I took your coffee in my mouth and sucked it for you, would you like that? You tell me. 
[04:51:00]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Thank you so much. Oh yeah.  Oh no. Oh my God. This is horrific.  This sounds like audio that you hear on an HBO undercover, like where they videotape the fucking, the real turning.  Yeah.  And this is something John Douglas had to go over when he found a fucking bloody ribbon somewhere outside by a tricycle. 
[04:51:30]  She's all steamy in this next clip. Has a hard time staying in character. Big A starts to get a little vulgar.  Yeah. Oh.  I'm not you're getting really wiped out there. I am too.  I'm rubbing my clit in little circles. I'm so hot. I'm wet. It feels so good. So good. 
[04:52:00]  Mmm. I wish you were here. Oh God.  Mmm. This is not easy. I'm not used to doing this crap. God help me. Oh yeah, big boy.  I wish I was looking at the tricycle. I wish I was looking at the tricycle. I wish I was looking at the tricycle. 
[04:52:30]  How big are your tits?  Um. They're double D. I've got great big round porno looking tits. You know the ones that don't sag but bounce nicely when you walk. That's what I've got.  And I've got a nice smooth hairless plussy. I get it wax all the time. I hate pubic hair on me. I just can't stand it. 
[04:53:00]  So you'd like to eat my pussy. Would you like to get your tongue in there? Nice and deep. Mmm. I'd like that a lot.  I'm getting really close now. Are you going to stroke that thing for me?  Your thumb up and down over the top of it. Mmm. Is it nice and hard? Is that hard for me?  I'm scared to have my coffee. It's very hard. And I wouldn't eat pussy. How much pussy is gone dry. 
[04:53:30]  What did he say?  I think you want to eat her pussy? Yeah.  Uh. And then something about a pussy. Oh God. Yeah.  That's great. Oh God indeed. Wow.  You want to hear more? Timmy, you alright? Yeah. 
[04:54:00]  What's wrong? Oh no.  Oh yeah, I'd lick your balls. I'd give them a nice long leg.  I'd roll them around in my mouth and stuff like that.  Ugh. Definitely. You're just what I want. Big man with a great big dick. I just love that. Mmm. Oh yeah. 
[04:54:30]  Yeah. I wish I was in you right now. I wish I was fucking and kissing and fucking.  And fucking. Something like that. Fucking. Sucking. Ah. Wow. Let's go to Frank in Brooklyn. Frank, what's up?  Yo, man. When Andrew first started talking, that had to be one of the funniest things ever in ONA history.  It's like, gee, who is this the first second? There was a jacking video, is there? What? 
[04:55:00]  Don't say there's jacking video, please. There is jacking video.  No, don't do it, man. Yeah. We can't do it.  We do believe there is jacking video. Oh my God.  She's good at fucking cyber sex, too. She's good, man. All right, Rob.  He's a black man. Chris from Oklahoma City saying, don't just, air at it, feed it. 
[04:55:30]  Big A.  Yes.  Creating it. Yeah.  Big A.  Big A.  You're a goer on that pal talk, huh?  Yes, I was, huh?  Yeah.  I mean, nothing wrong with that.  I think that's what Pal Talk's all about.  You just got to watch because you never know who's going to get hold of it. 
[04:56:00]  You know what I mean?  Yes, I found out the hard way.  Yeah.  He does have a sense of humor.  It seems like it did.  How did you hook up with this girl?  I was just chatting with her.  In what room?  One of the O&A rooms.  One of the O&A rooms.  All right, you're chatting with her.  And then what happened?  How did you go private? 
[04:56:30]  I just wanted to go private.  And we were talking.  And I just know.  It was being recorded.  Actually, I had a feeling.  It doesn't sound like you had a feeling, but it was in your pants, and you had no idea this was going on.  Yeah, then you kind of know it was you. 
[04:57:00]  Hold on a line for a second, Big A.  They could have fooled this guy with dugout Doris.  He still would have gone off.  We're only halfway done.  We got Richard Dreyfuss coming in.  So let's see if it heats up more.  She laughs once.  And then it ends, says, going in for round four. 
[04:57:30]  Stuck in your cock, and I reached around, and I stuck my finger up your ass.  Would you like me to suck your cock and put my finger in your ass?  Oh, yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, I like it, and I like to play.  Hmm.  I wish.  I wish I was right there.  I wish I was sucking your cock right now.  Sucking it in and out of my mouth.  And up and down, flicking my tongue back and forth over the eye. 
[04:58:00]  Or my, well, well, one of my hands sets your cock back and forth really fast.  So that your cock is sliding back and forth between my fingers.  And my lips are sliding on the shaft as well.  And every time I pull back a little, flicking back and forth as the eye of your cock.  Hmm.  That would make me so hot.  Like, I'm hot now.  I'm so hot.  My pussy is just so wet. 
[04:58:30]  I want you to come and think you're talking to me so bad.  Oh, thinking of that just makes me want to scream.  Oh, gross.  Hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, and I'm flicking my clit.  I'm really, really fat.  Oh, God, you make me horny, you big man, you.  Hmm. 
[04:59:00]  Hmm.  He he he he he he.  He's not going to get off the mic.  Because it's not.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  You're so scared of this thing.  Oh, yeah.  Baby.  I'm afraid.  Oh, man.  I want to help you.  I want to come all over you.  Oh, Jesus.  Just pick my heart, come.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  I'm in for round four.  Somebody help me. 
[04:59:30]  Oh, yeah.  I want to taste all of your cum.  I want to fit your cum rolling down my throat.  Well, perhaps you could spray a big, hot, wet lid all over my tits.  Oh, my God.  Big A's having a hard time because he's got pal talk on on half of a screen and the Qantas  website on the other.  He's booking a flight as he's fucking jerking off.  Big A's a dirty talking hack, though.  Oh, it's like.  I know.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Toots. 
[05:00:00]  Take it all.  I want to cum on you.  Oh, shit.  If beauty was a minute, you'd be an hour.  Take my hot cum?  Yeah.  A lot of people saying you have balls calling in the program today, Big A.  Hey, I want to be mad about it.  A man has to do what a man has to do.  Right.  How humiliating. 
[05:00:30]  That means there's going to be a fire at the studio entrance door.  Now, Big A, here's the big question.  And you know there's no lying or denying because the truth will come out.  Is there video and what are you doing in this video?  I guess you already know already.  I guess I'm in this video, all right?  No, but the video is en route.  It's on its way. 
[05:01:00]  So we haven't seen it yet.  But is it graphic?  Yes.  It's graphic.  So you took the camera and pointed it at your dick.  Oh, yes.  And you were jacking.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Let's see how to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah, I just wondered how you guys got the new Dateline online presence on before the damn show even came out. 
[05:01:30]  Sounds like Dateline audio, doesn't it?  All right.  Punch it out.  Love you guys.  Thank you, Bruce.  Who set this up?  I don't know.  Who set you up, Big A?  You know yet?  Oh, please, Angel.  Who?  Please.  Well, she was the girl, but did someone put her up to it?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's a whole crew of people that work on a lot of people.  Roach from Whackbag, what's up?  Well, I necessarily didn't put her up to it. 
[05:02:00]  I'm just the one that edited the video.  Oh, you edited the video.  How long is the video?  I haven't got all the video yet, but the audio was about 45 minutes.  Wow.  You had to edit it down, and it was about 10 minutes because there was a lot of stuttering.  Yeah.  Oh, it's great.  It says something here about a plug, a MySpace plug. 
[05:02:30]  Yeah.  The only reason I was sent the video, and I promised Blaze Angel that she would get a MySpace plug.  It's MySpace.com slash Blaze Angel.  You spell Blaze, B-L-A-I-Z-E?  Correct.  Blaze Angel.  B-L-A-I-Z-E.  All right.  Angel.  And believe it or not, she's actually from Australia.  Yeah, we got that.  Yeah, we know.  Yeah, cool.  Thank you, Roach.  Take it easy.  All right.  There's the plug.  Everyone go check out Blaze Angel on MySpace. 
[05:03:00]  Bobby Bigrigger.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Can we get to the part of the tape where you start getting Fetchy involved?  We're going to do a couple things, you know?  Very good, bro.  Let's say hi to Colin in Connecticut.  Colin.  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  This is your old friend, Colin Cosell.  Nothing.  It sounded like, remember those little Trainables videos from a year ago?  Yeah.  Where the guy walks in on the little boy whose sheets are all sticky.  You've had a wet dream.  I'm all right and sticky. 
[05:03:30]  Chester's Liver from Whackbag.com.  Is anyone else going to feel dumb if Big A is hung like a horse?  Big A.  Big A.  Yes.  How do you think you look in the video?  You're sporting?  You're looking big?  Not that big because I really thought I would know soon enough, I guess.  So.  Yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[05:04:00]  He's.  All right.  Colin.  Yes, sir.  Wait.  Hold on a minute.  Thumbs up?  Jimmy, you got the right DVD?  Jimmy, you got the right DVD.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank you very much.  Colin, I was going to have you do some Howard Cosell, do a little play-by-play to the video  there.  Oh, dude.  Oh, uh, you want me to come in and do that shit or do you, can you send it?  No, I was thinking just a, I was thinking just a quickie, like a little, uh, little  thing right now, just to hear the Howard Cosell, that's all.  He's got a gigantic, retarded, stuttering cock. 
[05:04:30]  He's choking it.  Slowly, he's going to blow his chromosome-lacking load all over his keyboard.  There you go.  That's all I wanted.  Very nice.  Thank you, Colin.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Have a good one.  Bye.  Come and see us sometime.  Let's say hi to, uh, Scotty.  Scotty, what's up?  Yo, man, this is wrong, man.  This is like a spring gobbler strutting in, thinking he's going to get laid and then getting  shot right in the head.  Yeah.  Punching off.  All right.  We're stalling because we don't have enough time to do the next four clips.  Tomorrow, you got to remind us, though. 
[05:05:00]  Tomorrow, we play the, uh, the clip that's titled, she's watching him jerk off, telling  him to go faster, and she's laughing her ass off.  Oh, come on.  That's where we're going to start tomorrow.  How about this?  Damn it.  You won't need to remind us.  That one we'll remember.  Yes.  All right.  Uh, she has a screaming orgasm.  Gets him to admit he's called Big A on Opie and Anthony, like we couldn't figure that  out on our own, and then finally, the grand finale tomorrow on the program, Big A has  an orgasm. 
[05:05:30]  No.  Is that on there?  Yeah.  His money shot is on there?  You're going to have to listen tomorrow.  We rarely tease, but seriously, we got to get some.  Can't you just fast forward to the.  Oh, my goodness.  These motherfuckers saying we're not doing good radio?  Well, that's what we do now.  You wait until tomorrow.  Those are the crumbs you were talking about, Leslie?  Yeah.  How about you start complimenting us a little bit?  Exactly.  Just a little bit.  Can do no right over here. 
[05:06:00]  We can do no right.  Rob on Long Island, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, it sounds like Big A's getting fucking fresh.  It's a fucking tissue box.  They're trying to have a conversation.  He's getting fucking fresh.  A lot of people asking if there's video of the girl.  Big A, is there video of the girl that was recorded or probably not, right?  Oh, she had no camera.  Only a mic.  So she wasn't even cammed up, and you cammed up and jacked for her. 
[05:06:30]  You rookie.  Wow, you are like the old people that get taken out of all their money through the scams  on the internet.  That's what you did.  You got taken of your dignity.  That's not bad, though.  It's like I kind of like the fact that you're doing the same thing on Pal Talk that we're  all doing on Pal Talk.  Someone on Pal Talk says, one night in Big A.  It's not one night in Paris.  One night in Big A.  Big A, you rule, man. 
[05:07:00]  I try, you know.  All right.  Well, you're going to have to call the show tomorrow for part two of your phone sex slash  video sex.  In fact, the next time he goes up, he's going to have backlighting.  Fucking, he's going to have the room cleaned up, mood music.  Believe me, he'll jerk off on Cam again.  He's a good boy.  The show is so messed up.  All right, Big A.  See you, sweetie.  All right.  You know something, Big A?  What worries me is how your mother is going to take this.  You don't have to tell her, Miss Ratchet. 
[05:07:30]  We'll see you tomorrow, okay, Big A?  I have to tinkle Opie.  Yeah.  I got to take a leak.  Yeah.  All right.  Break.  Let's take a break.  Once again, we'll play part two tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  I can't believe there's a money shot.  Is it good?  Is it good, man?  Steve was just like, Steve was listening to it next to me with headphones, and I have  never seen, Steve, to get horrified, is a lot, so it's good, yeah. 
[05:08:00]  It's really good.  Hey, this is a really funny phone call, really fast.  Melissa in Philly.  Melissa?  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to let you boys know that was the first time ever you've had some sex on  your show that I could not masturbate to.  What a letdown.  All right.  Yeah, it's a little rough.  But we'll try again tomorrow.  All right.  Thank you, Melissa.  Bye.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  So we got Lazlo in the studio to talk some tech stuff today.  Also, Big A phone sex. 
[05:08:30]  Oh, God.  You want to get right to the Big A stuff?  Because we did tease that at the end of the show yesterday.  That's where we left off yesterday.  Big A on Pal Talk.  Everyone knows what Pal Talk is now, right?  It's a little camera video conferencing thing that people get on.  And as they're chatting, in the old days, you just used to chat with text.  Now you've got a camera.  And you can do that video conferencing with people.  I don't see any cameras up, man.  Are there any girls in the room? 
[05:09:00]  And then if you hook up...  Well, I just got here.  Oh, okay.  If you hook up, then you go private.  You could take your conversation to a private room and get a little sexy and a little dirty.  Saucy.  And he hooked up with some girl from Australia.  Blaze Angel.  Blaze Angel.  That's her MySpace.  Blaze Angel.  One word.  B-L-A-I-Z-E.  Angel.  Blaze Angel.  And he hooked up.  They went into this private room and started getting a little saucy with each other. 
[05:09:30]  And Big A, he pulled it out and started jacking.  Exactly.  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  And he started jacking.  And she's talking dirty to him.  And he's trying to talk dirty to her, which is just hysterical.  What did he say at one point?  You had a hot cum.  Yeah, I wanted my...  Hot cum on you. 
[05:10:00]  Does the accent...  Does her accent add anything to it?  Because chicks with British and Australian accents always sound hotter than they are.  Yeah.  She sounds pretty hot.  She doesn't have that heavy an accent.  Right.  Which is a little odd.  And Steve has seen the video.  Now, you have the video.  Yeah.  Can we play it in here?  Can we play it in here?  We all want to see the video at the same time.  No one has seen the actual video in this room, right?  No.  Because I want to get the natural reaction when we see Big A whacking it for the first time.  I think what I can do is put it on a thing. 
[05:10:30]  Upload it somewhere.  And then give us the secret URL.  Oh, there it is.  Stupid volume.  Yeah, I think I'll put it somewhere and just give Eric where it is.  All right.  That'll work.  You can actually see it.  MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  No, Jimmy.  No, you can't.  You can't.  It's on Big A shirtlock material.  Whoring ass.  No, I wouldn't lie.  All right.  Here.  So here we go.  We got to play just the first part of the first clip because it's one of the funniest moments  in Opie and Anthony history.  Yeah.  I don't know if it'll do it justice to hear it for the second time, but just listen to 
[05:11:00]  this.  This is when we discover that Big A is about to have phone slash video pal talk sex with  the girl from Australia.  The girl from Australia.  Dirty boy.  Dirty boy.  Dirty boy.  Dirty boy.  Dirty boy.  So you want to play dirty with you here in the room with me?  You want to shake a big talk for me so if I can moan for you and make you come?  Is that it?  Is that what you want?  I'm scared. 
[05:11:30]  I don't know if that's okay with you.  Yeah, it's kind of like fun to me.  Why don't you come up and show me what you've got?  It's like when you first started making international phone calls.  There's like that long delay.  Yeah.  Okay, right.  Yeah.  That's okay with you.  It's like he's jerking off in the field in northern Iraq.  I want to come on your face.  Over.  Big A is the only one that can pull off an international phone call because the delay  doesn't affect the delay. 
[05:12:00]  We're hearing the bad.  Dead.  Auto delay.  That's great.  So we played a bunch of these clips.  Back to you, Wolf.  On yesterday's show.  We stopped yesterday just at the point where, let's see, she, all right, heats up more,  she laughs once, and then it then says going in for round four.  All right, we played that yesterday.  So what we got for today, Big A, at this point, she's watching him jerk off, 
[05:12:30]  telling him to go faster, and she's laughing her ass off.  Yeah.  He's not catching on.  Of course not.  He's hoping.  This is the second half of the Big A phone sex tape.  Would you like to see your camera rolling off my nipples?  Would that make you hot?  Oh, yeah.  It would just drive me crazy. 
[05:13:00]  Strike it faster.  Rugged thumb back and forth over the top of it for me.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I need.  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  Faster, baby.  Faster.  I'm so close.  I'm so close to coming.  Oh, God.  You say something sexy to me. 
[05:13:30]  Oh, God.  She can't even hold you.  Yeah, don't grab your hips.  I'll put my heart apart.  You can't push me.  And fuck you.  And fuck you so hard.  And you just put them all over with my heart talk.  Oh, I wouldn't like that so much.  I'm just kidding.  Anyway, I'm going to come. 
[05:14:00]  I need to come so bad.  Oh, do you want me to come for you?  Do you want to hear me come?  You will be molested.  I wish it was a little clearer, the audio.  He's like he's over-modulating the mic. 
[05:14:30]  He's all on top of it.  His big double chin flapping around.  And that's nothing but pure and simple, old-fashioned.  Communism happens every time one of those dancers  start poong-tanging around with those show-folk facts.  Here's a word of advice.  If you're ever cammed up and jerking off for someone who you can't see  and they're laughing like they're watching a Marx Brothers marathon,  they're not about to come.  Yeah, he didn't even acknowledge the fact that she busted out laughing.  He just kept on going. 
[05:15:00]  Like the thought that it was not real  and that he would have to, you know, tuck it away in shame and disgrace,  could not cross his mind.  He had to finish.  He thought she was five.  Here we go.  She gets him to admit he's called Big A on Opie and Anthony.  And what's your name?  What name would you let me to name?  Would you let me to name your real name?  Or the name that you use on Opie and Anthony? 
[05:15:30]  What name would you let me to name?  Tell me.  What name would you let me to name your real name?  So what name do they call you on Opie and Anthony?  I guess that's the thing that really turns me on, you know,  that you're on the show and I wanted to do something for you. 
[05:16:00]  What name do they call you on the show?  Yeah.  Oh, God, I hope you guys are liking this.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A, just in case no one can get it out by now.  The jigs up.  Where does he have the camera pointing?  Is it on his chin?  Oh, yeah.  I've heard.  I haven't seen it yet. 
[05:16:30]  We're all going to watch together.  For the first time today.  I heard it is square on his cock.  It's horrific.  And, yeah, it couldn't be worse.  So does he blow his load and then ten seconds later he goes,  Oh, yeah.  Well.  I got to go.  Well, that's the grand finale.  But first, she has a screaming orgasm and laughs again.  Big A, I like that big.  It's like big with your cock. 
[05:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, Big A, I'm going to kill him.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I love O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, God. 
[05:17:30]  Oh, God.  Big A.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Can you come on the mark for me?  Please?  Oh yeah, I'm ready for you to come to me.  Oh my god, so Big A obviously asked her if she's ready for him to come. 
[05:18:00]  Are you ready?  Are the new ones on here, Than? 
[05:18:30]  No, not yet.  No, not yet.  Not yet.  We'll have them tomorrow, Anthony.  The ones from...  Yeah, we'll have them tomorrow.  Yeah, the Goodfellas ones.  That'll be tomorrow.  It's okay.  It'll be okay.  No, I didn't know.  I was just asking.  I wasn't reprimanding.  Why aren't they on here?  I was just curious.  Alright, here we go.  The grand finale of Big A having phone sex with this girl in Australia.  Are you guys ready for this?  How long does this go on, the whole thing?  We just got edited version.  I know, but...  I heard it went on for about 40 minutes.  Yeah, 40 minutes or so. 
[05:19:00]  40 minutes.  40 minutes.  40 minutes.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.

[05:20:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  yeah  Don't just stare at it. Eat it. 
[05:20:30]  Don't just...  Don't just...  Look at it.  Look at it longingly.  So is there any kind of post-coital conversation from him?  Yeah, we had him on yesterday.  Yeah, we've got to get him on again today.  He was really none too happy, but realized there wasn't much he could do about it.  Are we punching up the video? 
[05:21:00]  We're trying.  Is that what we're trying?  Is the computer refusing to show it?  Is the monitor actually going blank?  Why is it on a...  No.  Danny's got a...  Solution?  You want to...  How about we go to a break?  Danny's like MacGyver.  Yeah, I've got to take a leak.  Yeah, we haven't leaked yet.  So why don't we take a break?  Hopefully when we get back, we'll watch the video for the first time.  Big A.  Jacket.  It's the worst.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[05:21:30]  Are the girls wowing on Pal Talk today, Anthony?  Yes, they are.  Yes, they are.  All righty.  It's a wonderful thing. 
[05:22:00]  Laszlo in studio.  The video is ready to go.  Waiting for Jimmy.  How long is this video, Hawk?  What, Hawk?  Five minutes long.  Oh.  Oh.  Get my dick out.  That's an eternity.  Put it away.  Laszlo, go over there so you can see.  We're going to turn the screen around.  We'll try to make this work for the radio, but basically we're going to watch Big A jerk off.  This is the first time we're seeing this video from his fine encounter with the Australian babe. 
[05:22:30]  Let's go.  All right, where is it?  Turn around.  I can't even make out what that is.  It's the size of a post-it stamp.  And I'm horrified.  Is he tugging on a flesh-colored new wow sticker?  Oh, no.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, no.  There it is.  Oh, my God. 
[05:23:00]  Zoom in, Hawk.  Big A, little C.  Little soldier.  Oh, my God.  That is a goddamn disgrace.  Looks like he shaved recently to make it look bigger.  Oh, my God.  That's all he's packing?  Oh, that is really sad.  He's such a big, hulking guy.  And he's got that.  That is.  We're going to be arrested for kiddie porn.  I think it's called, yeah. 
[05:23:30]  Infantilism or something.  When you have the junk of an infant, it never grows.  Get him on the phone.  Someone call his phone.  Are you on, Andrew?  Big A?  Yo.  Yes.  Hi.  How are you today?  Oh, fucking great.  How are you guys doing?  Don't worry.  It will be over soon, Big A.  Yeah.  Hang on. 
[05:24:00]  Don't go off all half-cocked.  We're kind of reviewing your latest video.  Is that a special pinky ring you're wearing while you're jacking?  Or is it a cock ring?  And, uh, well, I don't know what to say.  I, I'm...  Hey, Big A. 
[05:24:30]  Yes?  Did, did you think that maybe someone might videotape you doing this?  Um, no.  No.  Do you, do you use a different name, screen name or something?  No, I don't.  And, and you hooked up initially with this girl in an Opie and Anthony fan room?  Um, yes. 
[05:25:00]  Couldn't you possibly have thought for a second that you might be being set up?  Well, I thought about it, but...  Plus, you hope it doesn't happen to you.  Well, you hope it doesn't happen to you.  Well, um, Andrew, you keep, here's what Andrew's doing.  He's whacking his bag.  He kind of cups it with the two fingers.  Yeah.  The way you hold a teacup. 
[05:25:30]  And then you, you, you jerk it, but then you stop and your penis just kind of flexes on its own.  Why do you stop and let it flex on its own?  He's letting it work out.  Oh, Jesus.  He sounds like when, when Dateline comes in.  Yeah.  What were you doing talking to this 12-year-old?  Big A.  Oh, Jesus.  Big A, what do you think of this, uh, this girl for setting you up like this?  He's a fucking cunt.  Oh, wow. 
[05:26:00]  Oh, wow.  Okay.  You do realize you can cover your entire penis with one of our new bumper stickers.  We got Blaze Angel on the phone, Big A.  She's, uh, yeah, she's on the phone here.  She's on the phone with you, Big A.  What do you want to say to her?  I think she's a, you know, fucking cunt. 
[05:26:30]  And I was just using her voice.  If I actually saw her face and body, I would never have a camera.  Ooh.  Yeah, he never would have cammed up.  Wow.  Well, if she's a little cunt, you two make a perfect pair.  Blaze Angel, um, you want to defend yourself there? 
[05:27:00]  Oh.  Blaze?  The worst.  You always want to look at your best.  You always want to look at your best.  And, uh, wow.  Hey, Blaze Angel.  Yes?  Do you want to comment and defend yourself here?  Look at the finger moving.  His finger's moving, like, when he puts it by his thigh and his cock, like, the finger moves, like, when we talk.  And he goes, moves his, uh, fingers, yeah.  Do you want to comment?  He's a bloody sex pest.  He gets in your PM after knowing you for two minutes and says, hey, baby, do you have sex toys? 
[05:27:30]  What's to know about your favorite sexual positions and shit like that?  He got what he fucking deserved.  I was trying to be nice and put him off.  It's all about the, uh, sex, huh, when, uh, when he's on?  Yeah, he didn't even want to know if I had a decent brain.  He just wanted to know about my body.  Nobody does.  You got that.  You got to go.  We don't care if you've been lobotomized.  Well, fuck you, as you're laying there with an X mark on your head.  I want to hear about energies.  By the way, you have a very good phone sex voice.  You're really good.  Oh, thank you.  That was, like, my first time.  That was really good. 
[05:28:00]  I don't blame him for whacking the band.  Good delivery.  She was fantastic.  What were you thinking while you were watching him, uh, stroke his mule?  I was pretty graced out, and I was really surprised.  I heard that American guys were packing a bit more of a package.  If you use this guy as a representative of all Americans, we will come down there and  have war with Australia.  That's right.  Don't make us pull out our cocks.  Yeah.  This is Asia.  Promises, promises.  We have huge American cocks here. 
[05:28:30]  Listen, get your screen cap ready.  I'm Jim Norton when I'm on there, and I'll definitely give my bag a good whack for you.  No worries.  I'll try and work up a decent moan if I can.  Hey, Cindy, how did you find out about the Opie and Anthony show?  You're listening online, obviously.  I met a fellow chatter called Pristine Sneakers.  He used to come into our friendly chat room and mix it up a bit.  Invited me into the Opie and Anthony's Irish room, and they just started talking about you  guys and playing bits of your parts and stuff like that. 
[05:29:00]  Oh, God.  I can't.  Again, they're running the video again.  Big A.  It's on a loop.  Did he come?  We're going to call your dick Michael J. Fox.  It's little and twitches.  He stops, and then the dick just kind of moves on its own.  Yeah, and then it, like, twitches and jumps on its own.  Like a puggle.  Like he's flexing his pelvic muscle.  Yeah, his penis has the stammer as well.  And it's growing out of a triad of fat. 
[05:29:30]  It's like your lap is a big triangle.  Hold on, Cindy, for a second, okay?  Okay.  What time is it in Australia?  It is 10 minutes to 12.  10 minutes to 12?  What day?  Nighttime.  Nighttime?  Is it almost Thursday?  So it's almost what day?  Tell us what kind of weather we're going to have for Thursday.  It's almost Thursday? 
[05:30:00]  Yeah.  Fuck the weather.  What's the lottery numbers for tonight?  Because it's only Wednesday here.  Yeah, how does that work?  I don't know.  It's just a weird thing that happens.  It's frigging cold here at the moment.  Free the nuts off of brass muck.  Oh, it's cold here, too.  No, they're heading into winter in Australia.  Right, they're below the...  Hey, your toilet.  Clockwise or counterclockwise rotation?  Clockwise.  Clockwise.  Actually, I think so. 
[05:30:30]  I usually look down the toilet when it flushes.  Oh, you've got to look.  It's not high on the list.  You want to give the Opie and Anthony audience a little organ?  You were good.  You were really good.  Thank you.  No, I can't do that live.  My pal mates are already...  Oh, man, you're such a slut already.  Yeah, all right.  Hold on for one second.  I'm trying to fluff up here.  Hold on for a second.  Let's say hi to BCH from Whackbag.  BCH.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I'm just calling to put my vote in for gay.

[05:55:30]  yeah  the the enema  things like that  things that are  like i'm i'm sickly  i need to be in  your care  kind of a thing  it's a motherly  thing almost  it can be or  it could also be a  candy striper type  thing where they're  just hot chicks and  like little short  skirts  well that's  totally  that is completely  different  if there's a girl  in a rubber  nurse suit  with that big  red cross  on her hat  get away from  me  that's ridiculous  but a candy  striper thing 
[05:56:00]  that's kind of  cool  you know that's  cool  but but as long  as it doesn't go  into this  extravagant  scripted role  playing  oh i hate  that  you've been a  bad boy  yeah yes i  have  i sure have  i have  nurse  oh no what  are you gonna  do  you know sometimes  when i'm kissing i  have to fight the  urge to grab the  throat  do you really
