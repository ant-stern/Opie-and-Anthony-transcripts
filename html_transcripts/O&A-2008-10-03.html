<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony recounting a near-miss with the law after a reckless driving incident in the Midtown Tunnel.  He was pulled over by multiple police officers after aggressively honking at a bus and weaving through traffic, but ultimately let go. This transitioned into a discussion about the preceding night's vice-presidential debate between Sarah Palin and Joe Biden.  The hosts and callers largely deemed the debate underwhelming and boring, focusing their commentary on Palin's performance, her vocabulary ("gosh," "golly," "darn"), and her overall demeanor. Anthony frequently imitated Palin's voice and mannerisms.  The economic crisis, the 2008 election, and the difficulties faced by third-party candidates were also touched upon, interspersed with frequent complaints about technical difficulties with the show's phone system.  Promotion for Jim Norton's upcoming HBO show was included.

The show continued with the "Jocktober" segment, a satirical critique of the Chrisman Morning Show from Central Pennsylvania.  Studio guest Louis C.K. joined Opie and Anthony in dissecting clips from the Chrisman show, mocking its awkwardness, formulaic structure (including a female co-host referred to as "the hole"), and Gary Chrisman's perceived lack of enthusiasm.  Specific segments like "Filling It In" and Chrisman's "Rod the Boy" character (revealed to be Chrisman himself) were targets of their mockery.  The debate between Palin and Biden was again discussed, alongside listener calls, including one from "Stalker Patty" criticizing the primary system.  The conversation included tangents about Biden's attempts to connect with "average Joes," Michelle Obama, and a wax museum display of Christopher Reeve. George Carlin's commentary on politics and voting was played multiple times.  Further promotion for Jim Norton's and Louis C.K.'s upcoming specials was given.  The segment was rife with crude and offensive language.

The next segment began with a discussion of the recurring comedic theme of "the hole," followed by a discussion of the tax evasion indictment of Elio Castronovas, which sparked crude jokes about prison sex and other offensive topics.  A caller, Janine, commented on the situation.  The "Jocktober" segment continued with critiques of other radio shows, including a segment from the Today Show discussing Sarah Palin, which the hosts criticized for its focus on gender.  They then launched into a lengthy, offensive critique of a Diddy video blog expressing fear of Sarah Palin. The hosts also engaged in a humorous discussion of their own professional titles, using self-aggrandizing and offensive terms.  A self-proclaimed paranormal investigator's call resulted in extensive mocking and homophobic jokes.  Further calls followed, interspersed with offensive jokes, and conversations about Halloween, a mayor in drag and blackface, and childhood memories.  The latter part of the segment featured Dennis Hof from the Bunny Ranch, along with several employees including Air Force Amy, leading to conversations about sex work and sexually explicit jokes.  A guest with a facial deformity ("Half a Hulk Face") was repeatedly referenced in a demeaning manner.  More promotions and banter concluded this segment.

A subsequent segment centered on a shy intern, David, and his reluctance to engage in on-camera sexual activity. Opie, Anthony, and Air Force Amy attempted to convince him to visit the Bunny Ranch.  The conversation was extremely sexually explicit, with graphic descriptions of sexual acts and body parts.  Louis C.K. called in, contributing to the sexually charged atmosphere.  Patty, another woman, was discussed in sexually explicit terms.  The hosts also referenced a previous experience involving Jim Norton at the Bunny Ranch.

The final segment featured Patty, subjected to explicit acts, including digital penetration, by Dennis and Jimmy, with the hosts and other guests providing commentary and encouragement.  Patty's reactions ranged from discomfort to apparent arousal.  The hosts used vulgar and sexually degrading language towards Patty, referencing Sarah Palin, Juicy Lube, and Patty's virginity.  Discussions about Patty's experience and potential employment at the Bunny Ranch were prominent, along with other topics such as  Jimmy's upcoming HBO show and other sexually explicit jokes.  Don Wicklin, a company executive, made a brief appearance acknowledging the segment.  The show concluded with a "line of the day" segment featuring Louis C.K.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All right, what happened, Anthony?  Ah, Friday.  What happened?  What?  What?  I'm hearing that you got pulled over again.  Oh.  Oh, by the way, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, you better tell them the date.  They might think it's the best of.  I know.  When you say I've been pulled over. 
[00:00:30]  Jesus.  I don't know what it is with me.  Recently you told us you get pulled over twice a month, was it?  Probably twice a month.  And I thought that was a bit high.  I'm like, no way.  No one gets pulled over twice a month, but here we go.  Now I'm really, I'm in early for October.  Yeah.  One more pull over and I met my quota.  Yeah.  And I got the whole month pretty much to do it in.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Well, it wasn't technically a pull over.  It was a pull next to.  So, you know, I got up a little late today. 
[00:01:00]  I did my old shut the alarm off because when you're half asleep and half awake, you have  this weird sensibility that makes no sense at all where you assume I'm awake.  I could shut my eyes for a couple of minutes without any alarms left, you know, because  I had shut all my alarms off.  That is the worst.  And then what felt like two seconds of sleep was about 20 minutes of sleep. 
[00:01:30]  Of course.  And then how do you wake up and then you go, no, no, no, damn it.  That's time machine sleep.  Damn it.  And then you got to jump up and rush.  And then I just say to myself, I go, it doesn't matter.  As long as I'm there by, you know, 530, it's fine.  So don't rush and make it nutty yourself.  Don't panic.  Yeah.  No panicking.  Right.  So I drive.  I'm kind of, I'm doing a little weaving, you know, a little speeding to get in.  But that wasn't the problem. 
[00:02:00]  The problem was once I get into the Midtown Tunnel, it's a crapshoot.  When both lanes are open, usually they only have one lane open because they got this huge  machine that scrubs the walls of the tunnel.  I don't know why they have to do that.  Do you know?  Why do they have to keep tunnels clean?  Well, because I remember the old days of going through the tunnels and the walls were just  black.  They were just covered with exhaust and everything.  So I don't mind them cleaning the tunnels, but do it at three or two or three in the morning 
[00:02:30]  when no one's going through the tunnel.  I would love to know how much it costs the taxpayers of this fine city to clean the dumb  walls in the tunnels.  Keep the tiles clean in the tunnels.  Yeah, I would love to know because, you know, it's not like, you know, a little job.  You kind of give a tiny little company out there and I don't know, Lindenhurst or something.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's got to be millions of dollars.  It has to be millions.  Dude, it's proprietary machinery they use for this too. 
[00:03:00]  There's one machine that leads the pack that kind of squirts this soapy water on it.  Yeah.  And then this other machine follows it up with these brushes that are on these levered arms  that just cover the whole tunnel with foamy stuff.  And then another rinse machine and you drive past it and you just get pelted with soapy,  dirty tunnel water.  Yeah.  So I, but both tubes are open today.  Uh-huh.  So I come out of the gate there and you got to look. 
[00:03:30]  You got to look in front of you.  You got to see what's in there.  If it's one of those, um, buses that, that transport people from Queens into Manhattan,  the little, they almost look like they're there for sick old people buses.  Don't even get behind it unless you're driving a tank and can blast it out of your way because  those things will do 10 miles an hour wherever they're going.  I, I, I, they infuriate me. 
[00:04:00]  So I, I pick, I pick a lane and I get stuck behind, you know, one of these things.  So I'm doing 15 miles an hour through the tunnel.  I'm already late.  Were you annoyed?  I was so pissed, Jimmy.  I'm just like, and then they step on the, there's no one in front of them.  And then they're stepping on, brake lights are constantly coming on.  So every time the brakes came on, I went beep, beep.  So the guy might like, I'm hoping he'll notice like, what is, what is he beeping at? 
[00:04:30]  And then notice like every time I step on the brakes, he seems to beep.  Oh, why am I even stepping on the brakes?  You know, you try to put sense in their head, but it never works.  But most people, if that is being done to them, like if you did that to me, I would just slow  down and be a complete ass.  I'll, I'll hit you.  Yeah.  I'll, I'll just run right into the, the, the bumper.  Yeah, I understand, but I go crazy.  Most people don't want to be told what to do ever.  And if there's four of those little cones taken out, I'll switch lanes. 
[00:05:00]  Of course.  I'll just switch lanes in mid tunnel when you're not supposed to.  Yeah, but take out your own cones for the, for the people behind you.  Those things are like, yeah, they're just wobbly cones.  I did it with one of my old rentals or leases, like right at the tail end of my lease.  And it does leave some orange marks on your bumper.  So I decided against that.  I wait for the ones that are taken out already.  Okay.  But couldn't do that.  So I'm behind him.  The second I get out of the tunnel, it opens up to about two, four, six lanes that take 
[00:05:30]  you to various places, either a midtown, downtown or uptown, uh, two lanes each.  So I just, I hammer in one of the lanes where you just hear the engine go, and I race past  whoever was effing me in the tunnel.  And then in front of them was this black van.  It's just a piece of crap, black van.  So I go around the right side of them and zip back in front of them because I can't be in 
[00:06:00]  that lane because that's the one that turns to go, uh, in a different direction I want  to go.  Yeah, sure.  So I slip back in front.  You got to go through this little chicane.  It's like a little zigzag to get to the light.  I need to go to light.  It's just this thing I pay no attention to in the morning.  I usually, uh, make a right on red there.  I do stop to look.  Can you talk to Kenny?  Why?  I'm glad you're bringing this up.  Just talk to him and go, look, Kenny, 435 in the morning. 
[00:06:30]  Those lights are optional.  They are completely optional.  They're completely optional.  I stop.  I look.  Kenny jams on the brakes when he sees yellow.  I'm like, what are you doing?  We're the only, we're the only car on the road.  The only danger with that is that people time the lights at that hour.  Right.  And, and they'll drive at speed right toward a red light.  Looking at the side, you could see the reflection of the yellow on the other side, knowing that  it's going to turn red and you're going to get green.  Yeah.  But a lot of these guys, you know, they underestimate the length of a light. 
[00:07:00]  They go blowing through red lights.  Other people are blowing through their light that's turning yellow.  So it's a very dangerous situation going up third at that hour.  But, um, I come out of the tunnel.  I zip around this guy and then I hear whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  I'm like, is that like background noise on one of these commercials on Winsome?  Yeah.  What that is?  Because I didn't see any cops. 
[00:07:30]  I'm pretty, you know, I look around.  So I get ready to make my right on red, which is completely illegal.  And a van pulls up next to me and I just see Sergeant Stripes out the window.  Oops.  And I look and I see a van loaded with police officers.  Oops.  Just loaded.  That's not the one that was in the tunnel going slow, is it?  No.  Thank God.  Yeah.  But, uh, I did zip around him too.  Cause I zip around everybody once I get out of the tunnel.  My, my motto is you're not going faster than me. 
[00:08:00]  Get out of the way.  Kind of a thing.  I'm late.  It's a great motto.  It's my motto.  It's the worst motto.  It's my credo in life.  I, my mantra.  I repeat it.  It's not a motto.  That's just something a dick says.  Hence, it's my motto.  So, uh, he pulls up, he goes, uh, so what are you doing?  Running, running me off the road.  I was like, ah, I'm late.  Sorry, sir.  You know, I kind of late. 
[00:08:30]  He goes, and I see, he goes, I see what you're doing here.  You're in position to, you know, go through this light.  I go, yeah, I was gonna go up.  I'm late.  He was late for what?  I go.  Oh, and then I'm like, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, here's my, here's my chance.  Okay, here's my only chance.  Here's my chance.  They're either fans or not.  Late for the radio show?  Oh, where?  It's at, uh, K-Rock.  I'm going into, you know, 92.3 here in New York.  Um, oh, what's your name? 
[00:09:00]  I go, Anthony.  And, and the whole van of cops is now laughing at me.  They're all laughing at me.  And, uh, he was making a left.  I was making a right.  So, um, he, he just like shook his head.  He goes, ah, I guess we'll hear about this on the radio.  Well, here we are.  I go, yeah, I have to announce all of my pullovers.  But, uh, I, and then I had to turn and go, it's pretty sneaky in that, uh, that crappy van you're driving. 
[00:09:30]  Why do you have to be cocky?  No, I wasn't being cocky.  It was just, you know why?  It was the honest truth.  It was pretty sneaky in that crappy van.  Right.  Dude, it was a crappy black van, not one marking on it.  It looked like a van that somebody delivering bread, uh, uh, drives in or something.  Sure.  And, um.  But they're letting you off the hook and then you gotta kind of.  Oh, I know.  You gotta give them a little jab.  It was good natured.  All right.  I'm always good natured with, uh, the police officers.  And, you know, I admitted I was completely wrong. 
[00:10:00]  I was driving like a douche.  I do, you know, most mornings.  And when I'm, when I wake up late, I drive more douche-like.  So, uh, I want to thank those, uh, the, actually the, the, the sergeant there was very nice.  Well, you've many times on many occasions said that, like, yeah, I'll stop if the cop stops me, but they're not going to give me a ticket.  Uh, and you, I, uh, I don't think I've ever said that.  I, I do not have that type of.  I don't know.  I kind of remember something.  Yeah.  It's a matter of.  Something like that.  We've got the guts to do it. 
[00:10:30]  No, no.  See, now you're trying to get me in trouble by saying I say certain things that I never say.  Something about being unstoppable.  I have the utmost respect and complete gratitude when I'm giving, uh, given, uh, courtesy like that, uh, on the road after I've pulled a bonehead move.  I, I absolutely.  I understand you don't want to appreciate it.  I understand you don't want to say this on the radio.  You know, I, we understand the radio.  It's YouTube being jackass is trying to get me in trouble.  Just saying.  The next time I get pulled over by somebody that's listening. 
[00:11:00]  You're, you're a very different person.  The office is all we're saying.  No, I am not because I, like I said, it's the utmost respect and, and I appreciate the courtesy.  Something about, uh, you know, I show them who's boss.  No, you see, that isn't even something I would say.  Are you with me on this or not?  Of course.  Yeah.  Okay.  Shut up.  Jesus.  I would never.  Oh.  Something about, I dare you.  No, I wasn't blasting F the police on my radio. 
[00:11:30]  That's after you leave, you know.  No.  If one of these guys would just follow you after they pull you over, uh, they would realize that you don't learn any lessons whatsoever.  I learned lessons.  How many lights did you blow through after these guys gave you a break?  None.  Be honest.  None.  And I usually, when I turn on 57th.  Yeah.  It's two lanes going my direction.  If those two lanes are taken up by vehicles, I know they will not go faster than me and they'll make me miss the next light.  Right.  Which, which holds me up.  So I will go into the bus taxi turn lane thing and zip around them when the light turns green. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  But like I said, there's no one on the road and I wait for the green light.  I just got to get around people.  I got to get around them.  They don't know how to drive.  Does anyone have to get anywhere?  Is anyone in a rush in the morning to get somewhere?  Or is it just this lackadaisical frigging Sunday drive in the mountains to look at leaves?  What the hell are you doing?  Move.  Get out of the left lane too. 
[00:12:30]  Left lane.  Move.  Out of the way.  And most people hate their jobs.  Why would they be in a hurry to get there?  Oh, can't wait.  You know what?  Can't wait to load boxes in a truck all morning long.  Well, then don't make mine and many other people that I've noticed, many other people, don't  make them miserable by sitting in that left lane, pacing the car in the middle lane.  If you're in the left lane and you see a car right next to you in the middle lane for more than two seconds, you're in someone's way. 
[00:13:00]  You're blocking the entire effing road.  I'm with you with that.  And then there's idiots that will sit behind a big dump truck that is pelting you with rocks.  You hear it sounds like you're in a rainstorm, but it's rocks and sand just sandblasting and pelting your vehicle.  And what do they do?  They sit there.  So I got to make a move into the right lane from the left, sweep around the truck, and then way back into the left. 
[00:13:30]  Which is another illegal move because I'm doing 90 at the time.  But I don't want to sit there getting pelted by rocks from dump trucks.  What was the silliest vehicle that ever pulled you over?  I ask that because Kevin from Connecticut writes, I got pulled over by an ice cream truck once.  Oh, that's bad.  That is bad.  I guess today has to rank right up there.  It wasn't a pullover, but like I said, the guy pulled up to my window with his window there. 
[00:14:00]  Because that was just, out of any car on the road, I wouldn't have even thought that was a car that had cops in it, a van.  Yeah, it was.  All right.  Well, I appreciate it because I was, you know, a little tardy.  I decided to pull the old, let's get a little more sleep.  I'm awake enough where I won't fall into a dick.  Yeah.  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  I was out.  Why don't we go for an early break? 
[00:14:30]  And when we get back, let's talk about that dumb debate they had last night, huh?  Okie doke.  Oh, gosh, I want to talk about that one.  Now, now, Joe.  Oh, gosh, darn it, Joe.  Oh, well, darn it.  Things got to be done.  Yeah.  I can't believe the way the papers were.  She, uh, she held her own, man.  That's what.  Didn't.  You saw it too, Jimmy?  I saw something.  I saw about an hour.  I was so bored.  I was like.  I didn't see it.  I didn't see that much.  I saw enough to know she did not hold her own. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  Let's get into it after the break.  How about that?  Our phone's working today.  Thank you, CBS, for allowing us to do our show properly by fixing the phones today.  Thank you.  And how's your laptop?  Is that okay, Ant?  Yes, that one is working.  For now.  Next time it goes down, though, you've got to smash it.  We've got to start showing who's boss around here.  Oh, yeah?  They're getting away with murder.  Who is?  Yeah, exactly.  I haven't seen one in a while.  Exactly.  877-212-ONA is the phone number. 
[00:15:30]  We'll continue.  Good morning to everybody.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm trying to meditate so I don't kick this phone system in.  No, you're still popping.  It's ridiculous, Jimmy.  The company we work for, they fired a million people and thought it wasn't going to have an effect on the product.  Well, guess what?  It's starting to have an effect.  See, we do a talk show.  We need phones to work. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  It's kind of important.  So I was told the phones work today, Anthony.  Yeah, I remember right before that break we took, we were very happy that the phones were working today.  And you thanked the company for fixing the phones.  Oh, I understand.  People hate when we bitch, bitch, bitch.  But, you know, come on.  So I give out the number, 877-212-ONA.  It's a perfect phone number for our talk show.  Oh, is it even ringing?  It's ringing, but they can't hear us or we can't hear them.  Oh, that works.  So now they want us to give out another number that no one's used to. 
[00:16:30]  What?  There's no way to do radio.  This is how they do it in, like, Des Moines, Iowa, where no one gives a crap.  We're in New York City.  We're syndicated through our satellite radio partners.  We are heard all over the effing world.  Of course we are.  We might be jock-tobered today.  Yeah, no kidding.  Good one.  Who's in charge these days?  I need a name.  Who's in charge, really? 
[00:17:00]  Of this?  Yeah, I don't even know.  GM is still Morrow.  Who's she?  She's the head honcho marino over this station, CBS, Fresh.  But maybe up to Don Belucas.  Who?  Don Belucas.  He's over in Cleveland.  These are all people we don't really have any, like, relationship with.  Dan Mason.  I think I saw Amara.  Remember when we did that K-Rock Girls thing?  Yeah.  How long ago was that?  She popped in during that.  That was the last time we saw her.  That's when we thought we were going to have some kind of rapport with the K-Rock Girls. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That fell through.  Yeah.  Could you please fix the phones?  It's, you know.  So this might work if I give out a number that no one knows?  Yeah, that's the main thing.  Oh, wonderful.  877-212-5762.  But don't write that down because that's temporary.  And then we'll go back to our other number when they figure out what today's problem is.  What was that number, though?  877-212-5762.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:18:00]  Baseball.  Really quick.  You got the Phillies beating the Brewers last night, leading that series two games to zip.  Stupid Philly crew calling me, like, over and over again.  Just still laughing that my Mets are out of it.  Then you got Joe Torrey's Dodgers.  Come on.  Now, I'm a huge Mets fan, but I love this Joe Torrey.  Always have.  I really, I could say that.  He's a stand-up guy, a great guy.  The Yankees should have never got rid of him.  And look at what he's doing.  They beat the Cubs again last night. 
[00:18:30]  An upset because they're playing at Wrigley, right?  Yep.  Dodgers got a two-to-zip lead in that series.  And his former team, the Yankees, completely meltdown out of it.  First time in 15 years.  They didn't make the playoffs.  Yeah.  So he's looking like a hero.  Absolutely.  I was for Torrey being fired, too.  I like Torrey a lot.  Yeah, I thought it was time to go.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Well, in eight years without it, he had been.  They certainly did a lot, you know, this year. 
[00:19:00]  I don't think it was Torrey, though.  I think it was a lousy choice of players that the stupid Steinbrenners were bringing in.  He just seems to be a good rah-rah type of guy, you know.  He really does.  And look what he's doing with the Dodgers.  I don't think the Dodgers were supposed to be this good this year.  Nope.  And then, speaking of your Yankees, Jimmy, because I know you want to elect the Yankees again someday.  I will.  They got A-Rod in the paper today.  And he's with some bimbo at one of these fancy joints in Manhattan. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  And he's wiping his mouth with $100.  That's good.  People are wondering if they got jobs and, you know, you got this crisis going on.  And there's A-Dick.  Look at A-Dick.  He thinks he's cute.  He's wiping his mouth with a $100 bill.  He pulled out like a wad of hundreds.  And he used one as a napkin.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, that's what your fans want to see today.  Sure.  Because they're wondering what the hell is going to happen to them.  They're wondering, you know, should they run to the bank today and get all their money out? 
[00:20:00]  Before the big collapse.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what you get to see.  And then you got the Rays beat in the White Sox.  Ha ha.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stunt Braylon is a White Sox fan.  Of course he is.  Rays in the White Sox.  Wow, that's an exciting series right there for everybody, huh?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  So the debate last night.  Yeah.  I think we called it here on our show.  Everyone was looking for fireworks.  Everyone was looking for this big thing to happen, whatever. 
[00:20:30]  Biden to go in and start ripping her apart.  Or Biden just dying of an aneurysm.  Yeah.  We were expecting something.  Or Palin going in there and just tripping over her own words.  And we got boring TV.  We got business as usual.  Absolutely.  Crappy vice presidential debate that kind of, eh, lackluster, I like to call it.  Yeah.  Just how they do the debates stinks. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  They have to work it out in advance and they work on the rules and this and that.  Why can't you just throw these two people on TV and just say, go?  Let them duke it out.  Let them duke it out.  But the papers, every paper here in New York is saying that she survived.  More than survived.  She wasn't great.  I watched her.  I'm not saying that she's a dummy.  I think that's a bad rap she gets.  I watched that stupid smile on her face.  It annoyed me.  And I watched her avoid certain answers and just throw out, and we're going to bring better government to Washington. 
[00:21:30]  Shut your mouth.  You're not.  We're the ones that are going to bring better government to Washington, Joel.  Isn't that right, Joel?  Yeah.  Oh, that frigging voice of hers.  You know what?  I was telling Anthony, she seems nice enough.  Yeah.  She seems, no way for a mom.  If I was a kid and, you know, I was friends with maybe her kids.  Yeah.  You know, not all of them.  Yeah.  But she seems like the house you'd want to go over. 
[00:22:00]  You know, oh, she's nice.  She bakes cookies for the kids and stuff.  Maybe the refrigerator's full of Sonny D.  Yeah.  Yeah, she, syndrome D.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  She winked, too, during the break.  She really bothered me with that. 
[00:22:30]  She was doing something.  That's a George Bush thing.  You have a little wink.  Thanks.  She didn't look too nervous or anything, but I told Anthony she would be perfect as a GM of, like, a light FM radio station.  You know what I mean?  She would be perfect.  Yeah.  She'd meet with the clients.  They'd love her.  She'd be personable and, you know.  That smile.  Oh.  Well, here we go.  This is just a couple clips that caught our head.  Okay, gosh.  She was using words like gosh a lot and golly. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Not sure I agree 100% with your politics there, Joe.  She's this close to the Fargo accent.  She's just off.  It's so close to Marge Gunderson.  Good to see you again, Jerry.  These numbers are right.  This looks pretty sweet.  Yeah.  Oh, those numbers are right, all right.  Believe me.  This is doable.  Congratulations, Jerry. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Thanks, Dan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks, Dan.  Yeah.  Hey, what do you know, Joe?  She said...  You know, the $700 billion bailout numbers look pretty sweet there, Joe.  Yeah, she's winking and saying darn and...  That's my deal, Joe.  Darn.  Nice to meet you.  Hey, can I call you Joe?  Hey, can I call you Joe?  I call you Joe?  Yeah, that's my name, dummy.  Yeah.  Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq, and that is not what our troops need to hear 
[00:24:00]  today, that's for sure, and it's not what our nation needs to be able to count on.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there was this execution-type deal.  That's what she sounds like.  Was it the risky homebuyers who shouldn't have been buying a home in the first place, and 
[00:24:30]  what should you be doing about it?  Darn right, it was the predator lenders who tried to talk Americans into thinking that  it was smart to buy a $300,000 house if we could only afford a $100,000 house.  There was deception there.  You're darn tootin' there was deception, and I don't think the house needed that true coat.  Oh, for Pete's sake, oh, for Pete's sake, he's fleeing the debate. 
[00:25:00]  He's fleeing the debate.  Oh, she really, really does kind of sound like that.  What is it about her, though?  Like, she bothers me.  Is it the innocence?  Is it the...  It's her dumb smile.  It's the fact that she's not saying anything of substance, I don't think.  It's very obvious stuff that she's saying.  Like, she made a good point about the predator lenders, and she also said that it's about  personal responsibility after that, and she was right.  I mean, I didn't disagree with a lot of what she said. 
[00:25:30]  I just, I thought I liked him better, and Biden's stupid plastic forehead is annoying  to look at.  Yeah, what is that?  I don't know.  Look, he's wearing a Halloween mask.  Yeah.  And I guess that was your presidential candidate in the wood chipper.  Look, the people in my neighborhood, they get it.  Ah, see, it ain't so, Joe.  There you go again, pointing backwards.  Oh, God.  Say it ain't so, Joe.  There you go again.  Say it ain't so, Joe. 
[00:26:00]  She's trying for that soundbite.  Of course she is.  She's doing the pit bull thing.  She wants...  Go six pack.  She wanted the big line of the debate.  The one that they just print in the papers.  Yeah.  They play over and over again on the news, and say it ain't so, Joe, weren't it.  Yeah, no.  No, but that's how, that's doing good.  Say it ain't so, Joe.  She's an irritant.  Do you want this, you want this yacht, this right behind the commander in chief?  Ah, I gotta go to the debate. 
[00:26:30]  Well, I'll cook you some breakfast, Sarah.  Oh, no, you sleep.  I just gotta go to the debate.  No, you need a good breakfast, Sarah.  I'll make you some eggs.  That oaf.  He was useless in Fargo.  The SUV needs a jump.  Look, the people in my neighborhood, they get it.  Ah, say it ain't so, Joe.  There you go again, pointing backwards again, though. 
[00:27:00]  You prefaced your whole comment with the Bush administration.  Now, doggone it.  Let's look ahead.  Now, doggone it.  I can't have someone in a position of power that says...  Gosh, golly, doggone it.  It's contrived.  It's calculated.  Is that what it is?  Because it's...  The persona is phony, contrived, down-hole me.  Hey, I'm just a mom here to give you some common sense.  Yeah.  And it sucks.  Oh, Joe.  I think it's time for a time-out for you. 
[00:27:30]  That's what she's doing.  She's trying to really appeal to the people that do talk like that.  The dopey moms out there in the Midwest and...  What about the nightcrawlers?  Joe?  Oh, and Joe Biden.  Yeah.  Oh, Sarah, you brought me some nightcrawlers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Hey, what you got there, Joe?  Some nightcrawlers?  Let's say hi to Jim in Jersey.  Jim.  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead, Jim.  Who's this?  I'm sorry.  You're kidding, Jim.  Wait.  Hello?  Who's this?  I'm sorry.  What?  Do you realize what you just said?  Jim.  Hello?  I'm sorry.  I was waiting for her to-lee-loo last night.  That would have been great.  What is he talking about?  I don't know.  We accept your apology.  Yeah, exactly.  The phones are still broken. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Only idiots can get through.  Yeah.  Let's go to Brett in North Carolina.  Brett.  Good morning.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I think you two, O&A, you don't know what to do, because she's younger than you, and  I know you're both into younger women, so you don't want to like her, you don't want  to hate her, and I just think that you should just cough it up, say she's hot, and move  on.  I think she's sexy, but she's sexy for her age.  She's a mom.  Whatever, man.  She's a mom. 
[00:29:00]  When have I ever been into moms?  That's not how I pick my vice president.  That kiddie water slide gets all stretched.  The problem I have is very simple.  There seems that there were hundreds of people more qualified than this Sarah Palin.  Simple as that.  Maybe she could be a new star in the Republican Party, but to go from what she was doing to  the vice presidency is ridiculous. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  I think Condoleezza Rice would have been, even though she's too closely associated with  Bush.  Right.  I would rather, I would have had a lot more faith in McCain's decision if he had picked  her.  Let's say hi to Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  And Joe, people all kind of need the two-cent stamps there.  Two-cent stamp.  It was a good joke, but I delivered it like shit, punching out.  Oh.  Wow. 
[00:30:00]  You have no need to call to get snippy with me.  I'm just trying to do my job here.  It's my deal here, see?  It's my deal here, Joel.  Mike in Connecticut.  We get this every day now for some reason.  Go ahead, Mike.  Say what you have to say.  You'll be today's person.  What's up, guys?  I just want to say, you know I love you guys, but I have to call you out.  You guys all wanted to get with Palin there a while ago, saying how hot she was, and now  you guys are lighting her up like a Christmas tree.  Dude, you can still back...  I think it's a little unfair there, but I also want to say... 
[00:30:30]  Hold on.  We weren't on the Sarah Palin bandwagon at all.  We acknowledged, holy crap, she's hot and all that.  You thought Howard Johnson was wearing a uniform just to get back to yesteryear.  Come on, bud.  He's got a point.  He showed me my place today.  But dude, wanting to bang Sarah Palin, it's fine.  Yeah.  Biden was saying, you guys got to come back to my neighbor and come back to the old hood. 
[00:31:00]  He hasn't been in the old hood or in the Home Depot in years, and you guys haven't called  him out on that yet?  Biden has been, and Biden is not a rich man.  I'm not saying she's rich, but Biden's been in the game for 30 years.  And I just think that he's got...  I like him more because he's been there a lot longer.  He knows a lot more about foreign policy.  He doesn't claim to see Russia from his backyard while he's milking a goat at 2 o'clock in the  afternoon in his pitch blackout.  Biden is an ass.  He's just not as funny as Palin is.  That's pretty much it.  She's funnier.  And the thing is, we've seen a million Bidens over the years. 
[00:31:30]  This is the first time you've seen an inexperienced female going for the vice presidency.  That's why there's so much attention on this.  And Mike, my whole angle on this right now is I hate them all.  I was leaning toward Obama, but now I'm like, ah, whatever.  It doesn't matter in the end who's the president.  Condi Rice would have been a much better choice.  Unless there's some reason they didn't go there, probably because she's too closely  associated with this.  I've been waiting for Obama to, you know, for the knockout punch.  It's just not happening. 
[00:32:00]  He's a great speaker.  He's wonderful.  But now he's playing the game on TV.  He changed his look to be more serious because, you know, we're heading toward tough times  here in America with, you know, the economic crisis.  So all of a sudden he changed his whole look on TV.  Like someone said, you got to look presidential and more serious.  So he starts serious.  Watch for the video of Obama now.  He's squinting his eyes and he's getting really down and serious.  It's all calculated BS.  I like when you bash everyone. 
[00:32:30]  And I just, you know, when I turned on here, I mean, you guys throw a little at Biden to  make everyone laugh, you know, I'm with you.  You guys are awesome.  We don't have to throw in a little bit of something to appease the fact that you want  it to be even handed.  If we want to bash Palin, we'll bash Palin.  You don't, we don't, what are we, with the fairness doctrine?  If you want to make fun of somebody, we'll make fun.  If Anthony wants to do a hilarious, her, what are we supposed to go?  Now, now, in fairness, Ant, let me do a Biden, some dullard with a stupid Botox far-headed 
[00:33:00]  Delaware accent.  Who does an impression of him?  Dude, and Mike, the bottom line here is with all the goofing going on, I'm still voting  for the dummy and the old guy.  There you go.  I'm voting too with you, buddy.  Have a good one, guys.  I'm punching out, man.  You know what's weird about our show?  Like, people, you don't have to agree with what we're doing.  There are radio shows out there, if you don't agree with their point of view, they get really,  really mad.  We don't care.  We're just going for the jokes and speaking our mind.  Both candidates are well represented on this radio show. 
[00:33:30]  Jimmy is absolutely voting for Obama.  Anthony's absolutely voting for McCain.  And I'm like, wishy-washy in the middle here.  Simple as that.  I was leaning Obama, without a doubt.  Now it's like, eh, eh.  You're right, though.  His serious demeanor that all of his advisors told him to take on.  And now he's doing that to try to look more presidential.  He's, where's this change?  He's business as usual, too.  Don't even, which, you know something? 
[00:34:00]  It is strange, because it makes me not as upset at him as a candidate.  Because it leads me to believe that if he does get in, it is just going to be business as usual.  No matter what he is.  I don't think much ever changes.  I really don't.  Just another, he's not some revolutionary, not some, you know, guy with these big, bright,  new ideas that are going to change the country.  It's just another guy that's going to be in there that's not going to be able to get anything  done because Congress can't get along. 
[00:34:30]  It's just a mess.  We're in this giant mess.  We haven't followed a presidential race this closely ever.  And I and Jimmy, of course, have been doing this show for a very long time now.  And I feel like and I watch all the all the shows now.  I still feel like I don't know any of these guys.  Who's the real Obama?  Who's the real Sarah Palin?  Who's the real McCain?  I don't know these guys.  Biden.  Because Biden was saying how how Obama is not qualified. 
[00:35:00]  And now he's his running mate.  How does that work?  Saying that he's very qualified.  And he was in McCain's corner.  But now what is going on?  Yeah.  How do people just forget that?  Well, she brought it up yesterday during the debate and Biden was just like went on to  the next thing.  I thought he was going to like.  That was a good one.  I thought he was going to, you know, have an answer for that, something that would make  sense.  But he just blew it off like she never said it.  Yeah, that's what they do.  And what was his soundbites officially?  Something like Obama's not experienced enough to be the.  He said Obama is not qualified to be commander in chief. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  And she brought it up and went right past it.  And what did he say about McCain?  Oh, he supported McCain on several points on the on the war at one point.  Sure.  When Obama was the other way.  Yeah.  And then he said, no, I didn't do that.  Oh, golly.  Why don't you answer?  Answer the question.  I think as Americans, we should be really pissed off that this is our choices.  Out of out of out of our amazing government and this amazing country, this is the best  they have to offer us.  It's we should be outraged. 
[00:36:00]  This is it.  We should be outraged.  Well, we don't do anything about it.  Uh, pro pro self-destructed back in 92, uh, because he's such a psychopath, 17% people  could get a third party in there if we voted for it.  We don't.  That's the problem.  We're too scared.  We all think it's not going to matter.  It's our fault.  You know, pro pro had a real shot and then he, and then he shoves a, uh, what?  Stockdale down on what?  What was he thinking?  Who am I?  What am I doing?  Why am I here? 
[00:36:30]  Why am I here?  Didn't he basically admit that women should be shoving coat hangers up there?  What was the big faux pas during that debate?  I forget.  It was just something where everyone just had their mouths open looking at the TV like,  what is wrong with this guy?  Uh, nothing.  Let's say hi to Chris in Cleveland.  Chris in Cleveland.  Chris.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, um, by the way, when I'm on hold, I can't hear you guys at all, so I don't know  what's going on.  Why would you be able to hear us?  Yeah, that'd make too much sense. 
[00:37:00]  That's what did the company show effort, right?  Right.  Anyway, if anyone else besides me knows that Sarah Palin can't say nuclear, she's like  Bush, but she says nuclear.  Nuclear.  Yeah, I did.  Punch that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's another nuclear person.  But Carter said that too, and he was a nuclear physicist.  Did that?  I don't understand that whole thing.  It's a word.  It's nuclear.  It's like new and clear, and you put them together.  Nuclear.  Yeah.  It's nuclear.  And for some reason, these people say nuclear. 
[00:37:30]  That's like saying Piscetti.  It really is.  It's like Piscetti.  Hey, happy butt calling.  Well, writing from Detroit.  I wonder if it's cold in the D today.  It's got to be cold in the D.  It's got to be.  Happy butt writes, Biden is a crybaby.  See, here you go.  This is what people said about Biden this morning.  Oh, and Chris Matthews said that Palin got the questions beforehand.  No way.  Please tell me that's not true.  Yeah.  That's why we got more boring TV last night. 
[00:38:00]  Excuse me.  How could they?  They made a big deal at the start saying nobody got the questions.  Gwen Ifill said that not even the debate commission was allowed to see her question.  By the way, she sucked.  Well, she's boring.  She's PBS.  She sucked.  Yeah.  She's highly regarded in political circles, but she sucked.  There were times I'm sitting there going, okay, as the moderator, now you can get these  two to mix it up a little bit.  Yeah.  Because what's his name with the presidential debate did that?  Try to get the two guys to mix it up. 
[00:38:30]  Who was that?  I forget his name.  I forgot too, but oh, whatever.  But she like backed off when it was about to get good.  I think she was really trying to cover her ass because there had been so much controversy  that she was moderating.  She's writing a book about Obama.  It's pro-Obama.  I mean, that's a little conflict of interest, so I think she was trying not to get involved  as much as possible.  Yeah.  Let's go to Joe on Long Island.  Well, she did actually play her hand, though, when she would give Biden like an extra minute  each time, and then Palin would talk, and she would go, shut up, white bitch. 
[00:39:00]  How is no one talking about that?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a big...  That must have been the last half hour.  She was uncalled for.  I bailed after an hour.  I did my job.  I sat through that crap for an hour last night.  Joe, what do you got?  Hey, Sarah, that baby's kind of funny-looking, more than most kids even.  Yeah, we're with it, man.  We're with the bit.  But she's just off from the cargo.  Yeah.  Just off, but close enough.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Let's say hi to Joe in Maine.  Joe?  Hi.  Hey.  Hey.  Sarah Palin, within the first 10 minutes of the debate, gave a you-betcha.  She sounded just like Frances McDormand.  Yeah, she was terrible.  She winked, and she was so irritating.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Greg in New Hampshire.  Greg.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Hope.  I hear you complaining about this is our choice, and the fact is I don't think you vote in the  primary, and I'd be surprised if any of you guys are even registered to vote. 
[00:40:00]  You're right.  If you don't participate in the process, it's hard for me to listen to you guys rail on the  process.  You know what?  Get me the George Carlin bit about voting.  He sums it up for everybody.  Don't, uh, if you're not involved in the process, you don't, uh, you can't say anything about  it.  I hate, I hate people like Greg.  Are you even, are you registered to vote at?  That's interesting.  I mean, there's, there's, there's, yes, I am.  There's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, I don't like the  choices. 
[00:40:30]  There's a lot of people like me out there that don't vote because they can give a crap.  They know the system doesn't change.  And let me, let me tell you something.  When's the last time you were in the voting booth?  You cannot rail against the process unless you contribute.  I'll answer your question.  Four years ago.  It is your duty as an American.  You're such an idiot.  All right, Frankus.  Give us a frunkus.  But he is, he is right to a certain degree.  Hold on.  But the process is the process.  Yeah, yeah.  So you can only have a voice in this country if, if you vote, right? 
[00:41:00]  Right, your First Amendment, it says there right in the First Amendment that unless you  vote, you have no First Amendment right.  Right, uh, Greg?  That is the dumbest thing.  Is that true?  That people say.  Shut up!  To non-voters.  He's right, look.  You do not.  That's the dumbest thing that people say to non-voters.  You can still have a voice.  So, so, so, so, Greg, I don't like either choice, so I'm supposed to vote anyway?  You didn't vote in the primary, O.B.  What, you, the truth is that? 
[00:41:30]  Who votes in the primary?  Shut your yap.  Why would I shut my yap, Ant?  The fact is the fact.  O.B. hasn't been to a goddamn voting booth.  That's right.  And I openly admit that.  What if Hitler and Stalin were running?  You're 50 years old, O.B., and you still haven't voted.  Oh, yeah.  You know, Greg, go away.  Go away.  No, grow up, you old man.  Go away, you dope.  I'll get 50-year-old guys who never voted.  Yeah, that's exactly how old I am, you dope.  Yes, I know you are, you old fart.  Keep going, Greg.  Did we get under your skin, Greg? 
[00:42:00]  Did we?  Did we?  Did we get under your skin, Greg?  Come on, old ladies.  Get yourself to the voice.  Hey, Greg, I voted one time.  Greg, shut up!  Shut up!  We could do this all day.  Let you be far.  I can't pick you up and take you to the voting court.  Hey, stupid.  Go ahead.  We'll put him down in the mix.  Put him down.  Go ahead.  No, let him be right there.  I'm trying to.  I'm not going to.  No, I'm not going to talk to him.  You don't have any of these things.  Huh?  Bunch of old biddies.  Get out there and vote, you bag.  Oh, who was that?  His whore?  Probably.  Was that his whore?  Probably.  No, he should have. 
[00:42:30]  I wanted to bring him all the way down because I was trying to agree with him.  He is technically, he has a point.  I think.  Yeah, of course he does.  But I know that.  I voted for parole.  Well, what's the point?  The point is that.  You can have a voice.  Well, yeah, of course.  Of course you can.  But the point is that there are third parties and that's the option.  You could always vote.  There are other guys running.  And just to spit in the system's face, you could vote for one of them.  Because if, you know, if four million people think that way, even if the person doesn't win, it does show that other people. 
[00:43:00]  But it also could derail the candidate that you might feel better about than the other one.  Then vote for that guy.  If you're so indifferent that you don't care, vote for a third party.  And I'm a guy who doesn't vote.  So I'm just, I like the fact that that guy got so annoyed.  But there is a point to that.  Like, hey, you should.  But the thing is, you have a right to speak your mind.  Well, yeah.  And you can bitch about the candidates, whether you've cast a vote or not. 
[00:43:30]  I love the people that say, if you haven't voted, you have no voice.  You can't speak.  It's like, no, you can.  Of course you have.  And I do vote dummy.  I didn't vote in the primaries.  Sorry.  I'm busy.  I'm busy in my pool.  There is a way to be involved in the process and make a, you know, and there is a point, as you said, like, we're not voting at all and just bitching about what happens without contributing at all. 
[00:44:00]  There's a point to that.  Where are the people that are worth going and voting in the primary for?  Where are they?  Where are they?  It's the same group of dicks that are in there.  If it wasn't McCain and stupid Obama, it would have been two other people that no one gives a crap about or it's business as usual.  Or is it that there's never this new genius that is injected into the scene that people get all psyched about to vote for? 
[00:44:30]  How about Rudy?  If you like Rudy in the primary, I'm not saying Rudy, but vote for Rudy.  And then if you don't get it, then go for a Democratic president or whatever or whatever.  So why not?  And I'm the guy who doesn't do it.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I understand that guy's point.  But it's like, of course, you have a right to say that.  Mike in New York, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, I just wanted to say, make reference to the.  There's a South Park episode called.  It was about the presidential debate back in 2004. 
[00:45:00]  And it's pretty much between.  They were looking for a new school mascot.  And it was between an S sandwich and a giant douche.  So pretty much every time there's a presidential debate, you're going through the same exact motions.  It's whatever is the less of the two evils.  Right.  You're forced to vote for, you know, you're forced to vote for someone you don't want to vote for.  Yeah.  So then you don't vote.  So you don't vote.  But then you've got no right to say anything about anything. 
[00:45:30]  A lot of people.  That's such crap.  Voter will sew your mouth shut.  Carlin sums it up.  Danny's trying to find a clip.  Maybe after the break.  I love his take on the whole not voting thing.  It's brilliant.  George Carlin was brilliant.  He certainly was.  And I don't want to do his bit.  I don't want to, you know, hatchet his bit.  So we'll play it in his words after the break.  But there are third parties there.  If there was only two parties, I would agree.  But there's third parties there.  There's fourth parties there.  These guys are getting no press. 
[00:46:00]  But, you know, if we did our political homework.  I don't do it.  But, I mean, realistically, you know, there are people out there.  People like Ron Paul.  I don't know much about him.  But people like this.  They said this guy was great.  I like Paul R. Nelson.  Can you write people in, too?  Can't you write in a candidate if you like them?  Yeah.  But the thing is, let's be realistic here.  Your write-in candidates, your third-party candidates,  they don't have the resources to get their word out to enough people to win. 
[00:46:30]  They just don't.  It's not.  And it's been that way forever.  You're getting a Democrat or a Republican in office.  There's not going to be one day where this independent comes out of nowhere.  And, you know, we're a nation that loves a slick commercial.  That's what makes us buy things.  And that's exactly what you're doing here.  You're buying a product.  But unless the person has the money to put the commercials and the billboards 
[00:47:00]  and the ads and the slick graphics, you're not going to win.  You got Pepsi, you got Coke, and then you got...  Royal Crown.  There you go.  I'm voting for Royal Crown.  You can't even find it.  That's the problem.  They don't have enough money to have placement in the supermarkets.  Of course not.  You know what's got to happen with the third party is like a biggie,  a big name has to just, like, shock everybody and go,  hey, I am now independent.  You know, I know you bring up the name and people either go love him or hate him. 
[00:47:30]  But let's say someone like Al Gore just went, you know what,  I'm going to be a third party candidate.  That would get pressed.  That would get some votes.  Not these guys that you don't know.  They're low-level guys trying to make a big name in the big game.  Cut the legs off some of these guys.  Take their money out from under them.  Make some kind of a spending cap on the presidency, on promoting yourself.  Because it's usually the guy with the most money that pours the most money into the campaign that wins. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  If enough people enough times go for a certain third party and it starts to pop up a little bit,  it will catch on.  None of us want to do it, me included.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to John in Brooklyn.  John.  Hey there, Jan.  I was just wondering if anyone was looking and realizing that whenever Palin's on,  they try to show it a side or back shot.  And you want Biden's on, you barely get a chance to see his face.  You know what?  That was so calculated last night.  Yeah, they had a shot of Palin's ass. 
[00:48:30]  Like every other minute or so.  And then they had a shot of Biden's, the back of his head,  that plastic dome of his that Jimmy pointed out.  That's what you got.  Either Palin's ass or Biden's plastic dome.  Got to go with Palin's ass.  I was hoping to get a shot at Biden's ass to see what's going on.  Biden's ass and Palin's head.  Yeah, they were showing the reruns and they were still just showing that side shot.  They were just dying to just show her ass right on.  It was just so obvious.  They know what makes good TV.  It's like, you know, get a shot of the skirt's ass. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, what about Bloomberg for a third party candidate if he ever wanted to run?  He's irritating because he's the same guy that didn't want Rudy to run.  For a third term.  Yeah.  But I also, I'm against term limits, I think.  Because then you have one.  What's that?  He's a big name, though.  You know, I don't disagree.  That would get some attention.  That's what I'm talking about.  You got to get a guy that's already has some attention to go third party on you.  And then it would get the whole third party.  Then it would get the whole third party process going. 
[00:49:30]  And then it would get some momentum, maybe.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Let's say hi to Scott before the break.  Scott in Florida.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good, Scott.  And then he's just not going to talk.  Yeah.  What do you got, Scott?  Yeah, I thought my write-in candidate was, the debate was tonight on HBO at midnight.  These were having a big party.  Got the girls coming over, the booth and stuff. 
[00:50:00]  They're talking about write-ins.  See, he's trying to do you a favor here, Jimmy.  And he's just screwing it all up by saying the write-in part.  You should have just said, I thought the debate was tonight, midnight on HBO.  That's not what it is.  That's another show.  So, we're definitely trying to do a clever plug for Jim Norton's HBO show that premieres  tonight at midnight after Bill Maher on HBO.  You're a little sleepy.  It's called Down and Dirty.  And we're all going to be watching tonight.  Is that what you were? 
[00:50:30]  All right, Scott.  Thanks, Scott.  Wow.  There's nothing we can do with that.  I'm actually going to take it off my TiVo now.  We got a great Palin song.  Or should we say Palin?  Do we?  Is it great?  Yeah, it's wonderful.  Christ.  We love the hacky songs.  This one's a good one.  Is it?  It's called Sarah Palin Man.  Sarah Palin Man.  No?  No. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, damn it.  Guess the song.  Guess it.  All right.  That's a good guess, actually.  I forgot.  All right.  You'll find out what song they sing Sarah Palin Man to after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  A very good morning to all my non-voters out there.  Hang tough.  Why are you talking?  Hang tough.  Why are you talking?  Hang tough.  You didn't vote.  You can't talk.  Keep your mouth shut.  Cut out his tongue.  Hang tough.  You're like me.  You have better things to do.  I understand.  I understand the mind of a non-voter. 
[00:51:30]  Mm-hmm.  Anthony, someone's saying you're wrong, which is impossible.  You're wrong?  You're never wrong.  Let's go to Tom in New York.  Hey, Tom.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Tom?  Hey, yeah.  I think he had me a comment that no independent has ever won.  But correct me if I'm wrong, too.  But I believe, wasn't it Teddy Roosevelt that actually won on the independent ticket?  Did I say no independence won, or did I say how long has it been, or something like that? 
[00:52:00]  Perhaps I did, but geez, look how far back you went.  Teddy Roosevelt.  Those are in the days where any Joe could get up on a stump, on a tree stump, and go,  I will be running for president.  And people will be, harumph, harumph, yeah, harumph.  And then he's a candidate.  Now it's impossible to get on the ballot.  Yeah, but he actually ran on the primaries, I thought.  He ran on the primaries, lost.  It was the goddamn Teddy Roosevelt. 
[00:52:30]  You're talking about Teddy Roosevelt.  He went into war on a horse.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, we're talking about modern times here, sir.  Yeah.  There also were, you know, the Whigs.  Yes, the Whig Party.  What happened to the Whig Party?  Where's the Whigs?  They were very influential back in the day.  Yes.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Sean, North Carolina.  North Carolina, I got to say, a hotbed of Opie and Anthony activity.  What's up, Sean? 
[00:53:00]  I was watching that VP debate last night, don't you know?  Yeah.  That's a sweet dumper.  That's a pretty sweet dumper.  Uh-oh.  There it is.  If you guess Ramblin' Man, you're right.  Lord, I'm a Sarah Caleb man.  Oh, Joe Biden.  Big Mac made a stand. 
[00:53:30]  He's a Sarah Caleb man.  She was Marilyn Gumbin' her up in Alaska.  She can cast a fish in the right hand on the tongue.  Any woman who can have my kids to look the way she does.  Have a kind of home run.  Everyone.  Toot, toodly, doodly, doodly, doot. 
[00:54:00]  Toodaloot.  Toodaloodle, doodly, doodalood, dood, doot, toot.  Toodaly, toot-a-toot.  Toodly, doody, dood.  Toodaly, dood, toot, toot, toot.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  Lord, I'm a Sarah Caleb man.  She's a real tootie.  Go ahead and ask her, babe. 
[00:54:30]  So when it's time to throw me, bless her with your hand.  Be a Sarah Caleb man.  Yeah.  Lord, I'm a Sarah Caleb man.  Boo!  It sucks.  That was horrible.  And he's in there just playing his heart out, wasn't he?  Oh, he was into it, man.  Yeah.  Do that. 
[00:55:00]  I want to do that line over again.  I don't think I really got the Sarah Caleb man line in there.  Man.  Let's see how to S.  Oh, yeah.  It was definitely shoehorning.  Larry, Joe Biden.  She's tougher than Joe Biden.  Joe Biden.  She's not tougher than Joe Biden.  No.  Joe Biden's pretty tough.  She's overlooking that cesspool that we pity in Qualistate so we can take a few tax dollars  off of them.  She took on the oil companies, though, people. 
[00:55:30]  She didn't.  She did.  What'd she do?  She keeps saying it.  She took them on.  She was tough with them, Jimmy.  She's not.  Let's say how to S in New Mexico.  S.  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Jimmy, you are an evil genius.  Whoa.  Guys, I have to vote for McCain.  I'm a Republican, and I really wanted to like her, and I thought she got her ass handed  to her.  Not only saying nuclear three times, she did a shout out.  She sounded like a kid in high school doing an essay or something.  It was horrible, but the most important, the most embarrassing moment of the whole thing 
[00:56:00]  is she tried to say that nobody got Biden's joke, and he pulled the I'm rubber, you're  glue.  He goes, what, your joke?  And she forgot how to talk.  The thing was, there was something so, and they're all phony, she's just a contrived,  it's like she's trying to be charming, or she's trying to be so different, or just, hey,  I'm a loose mom up here, you know, nothing to gain, nothing to lose, and it just, there's  something about her phony, down-home personality that is making me want to throw up all over 
[00:56:30]  the front of my shirt.  What's wrong with talking like a grown-up?  It sounds pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  What was the shout-out, by the way, S?  Ah.  What was the shout-out?  Maybe she was mad at, you should have been, go ahead.  No, she shouted out a school up in Alaska where her brother or somebody in her family  is a teacher, and she said, the third grade, you get extra credit for watching.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right, got it, you know, that's right, she's a mom, and a, ah, shut up.  Biden made me cringe, I forgot the name he used, but when these politicians go really, 
[00:57:00]  really specific, I was talking to Jim Norton at the gas station.  And just, ah, this past weekend, I said, hey, Jim, how, how much did it cost you to  fill up your tank?  And you know what Jim said to me?  You know what Jim Norton said to me?  What?  He said, I don't know, because I don't have enough money.  Oh.  Ah.  Did that really happen?  Yeah, I, I, I, yeah, pretty much.  I was in a five and dime and met a woman in there.  Yeah, Betty, uh, Betty, uh, Harbour. 
[00:57:30]  No, you weren't.  And you didn't.  They have to bring it down to the, yeah.  I did see that, too.  The average Joe.  Who's, did that make you cringe?  It was awful.  Who is, do we have that?  I would love to hear that.  Yeah, it was early on in the bit.  Who, who's watching that going, going, he's talking about someone just like me.  Wow.  And he's talked with them and, and, and, and they told what it's like to be a regular Joe.  He wants to make it sound like he just happened to pull into a gas station and his old clunker 
[00:58:00]  and ran into, you know, Joe six pack.  Yeah.  He couldn't fill his tank, so I squeezed some of my Botox out of my forehead into his vehicle  and he drove for 40 miles on it.  You know, good point.  The Biden head.  I don't know what's going on there, man.  Those eyes look like they don't close at night when he tries to fall asleep.  His head's horrendous.  His head is a disaster.  It's amazing.  It looks like he has a full head of hair if you look at him straight on and then it looks  like he has a skull cap Halloween thing going on in the back. 
[00:58:30]  His head should be in that wax museum on 42nd Street.  Who's that for?  Madame Trousseau?  Yeah, yeah.  That stupid Samuel Jackson or The Rock in front?  Madame Trousseau?  Whatever the bitch's name is.  I don't know.  Trousseau.  Trousseau.  Trousseau.  Trousseau.  Trousseau.  Trousseau.  Yeah.  Just pulling it out of her ears and molding it into people's faces.  That would be...  I actually took a girl one time.  If you're listening, look, you were nice, but we had no sexual attraction.  A long time ago, I flew a girl in from Buffalo.  Mm-hmm.  And we just didn't have any attraction and she was a bit of a drinker.  And so I knew we weren't going to have sex. 
[00:59:00]  We just went to the wax museum and took funny pictures.  Yeah.  And then she stayed off and I waited until she fell asleep and I angrily made a mess on myself.  Hating her.  I went to the wax museum and took a picture of it because they had Christopher Reeve there  in the wheelchair.  They had like wheelchair Christopher Reeve.  I was like, what the...  Why?  I know, with the cape on.  That was just so tasteless.  I was like...  And they're playing the music.  Able to fall off a curb and do nothing about it.  So I remember that display. 
[00:59:30]  It was terrible.  It was very tasteless.  Able to roll quickly backwards downhill.  Look in the intersection tipping over.  It's like, why have that version of him?  And why not have like, you know, the younger version where he was a Superman?  But they did.  They had him in the wheelchair with the respirator and everything in a wax museum.  So I put my arm around him and was giving his head a noogie in the wheelchair.  And they snapped a humorous picture. 
[01:00:00]  Well, you know what I hate about that display, too?  There was actually one cool part.  If you shook the wheelchair, they had stuff in the spine.  It would go shink-a-link-a-link-a-link.  Oh.  Shink-a-link-a-link-a-link.  Did it go shink-a-link-a-link?  It's an exact impression.  It's perfect.  Hey.  I have to interrupt you because Stalker Patty, you know, she's a little known fact.  She knows a lot about this politic thing.  Stalker Patty.  Hey, how are you?  Hi, Patty.  Hi, Patty. 
[01:00:30]  I just have an opinion.  There's a part of the country not even represented in the primaries who don't even have the right to vote  because we're neither Republican or Democrat.  You're right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You know what?  Keep back.  You're saying what?  I was going to say the ants.  They're not represented in the political process.  I'm not.  I'm not allowed to vote in the primary.  Are you saying?  I'm not allowed to.  Patty, is there a discrimination, do you think, against 50-year-old retards?  No.  I'm just telling you. 
[01:01:00]  I'm a registered independent, and I don't have a say on any choices in the primary.  You don't have a say in life.  Oh, she's right, though.  I mean, I don't think it's fair.  100% of the country is not represented in those two choices.  It's only about 60% of the country.  That was a safety valve they put in there to keep people like you from making any real decisions in this country.  That's right.  Here, have a melon and leave.  Yeah, not for nothing, Anthony, but I am intelligent. 
[01:01:30]  You're not.  Oh!  Oh!  Okay.  I like that.  Okay, but that's how I feel.  I feel 100%.  You're getting a little too feisty for this show, Patty.  We got your confidence up, and now you think you're Adrian in, like, Rocky IV.  Yeah.  Enough!  Exactly.  What are you doing?  You know what bit was rerun the other day?  You making fun of the fact that she was an ant.  Yeah.  That's why I went with the ant.  Her little ant body. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, she's got an ant body.  Her thorax.  The thorax.  Yes.  She has a thorax, an abdomen, and a head.  Oh, I heard that.  And you know what?  Shut it.  I don't remember the phone call.  Yeah.  I was almost hearing it for the first time.  Close your mandibles.  Anthony's talking.  I was like, let's do that.  Okay, well, that's what I wanted to say.  Let's say hi to Steve in Rhode Island.  Steve.  Hey, good morning, boys.  How y'all doing?  Good.  Good.  Hey, listen, Opie, I just wanted to make a quick comment. 
[01:02:30]  I can't believe you're making me defend these fools, but your comment about Joe Biden  and the gas station cliche and all that good stuff.  I completely agree that these guys, all of them, use that kind of scenario, that awful  cliche.  But I think in Biden's case, it might be more true because he is, I think, the only candidate  that was running that isn't a millionaire, and he does commute on the train.  So I think he, I don't think he's as elitist as the other ones are. 
[01:03:00]  Well, I guess what I'm saying, I hate when any politician does it.  It seems so calculated.  Maybe we could get the guys to work on a few of those in the office.  They all have to bring it down to the...  That story that they have about the...  There's been a few famous ones over the years.  I was done.  Clinton had a bunch of them.  That's all I'm...  Bill Clinton, he was the one.  That's all I'm pointing out.  Sure, Biden has a chance of actually running into Joe Sixpack more than the rest of them,  but still, I just hate when they do that calculated, I was talking to the common man thing. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  No, I agree.  It's a cliche, but it's tiresome, but I just thought I'd chime in with that, and I appreciate  you letting me on.  We like just picking out trends on this show.  That's all.  This is a fact here that Biden's train ride costs $200 a day, and is that out of the taxpayer's  money?  No, he pays his own way, but he takes the Acela back and forth every day from Wilmington,  according to him, and if you do the checkup on Amtrak, it's $200.  $200 a day.  I'm sure he gets a discount to be on the train.  Well, maybe.  Probably $10. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Why, though, do they...  Why does he commute and still living there?  He likes to live in Wilmington and call himself Average Joe.  I've seen him at the train station there.  You have?  Yes, I have.  Do you have security?  No, just him getting off the train.  Getting off the train, jumping into his car at the train station, and going home.  Yeah, things have changed now, I'm sure.  Yeah, he seems like that type of guy.  Yeah.  Absolutely, but I just...  All right, whatever.  We made the point.  Hey, Keith Oberman, because he's terrific.  Oh, he's a pit bull.  Get out of his way.  Hell, he went after Obama last night, Jimmy. 
[01:04:30]  What?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  What, being yanked off the anchor desk really got to old Keithy, huh?  Let's be fair here, you know.  Let's do some Obama abuse now.  This is what Keith Oberman had to say last night.  The worst persons in the world.  LeBron's the Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.  Said Saturday, quote,  Finally, thank you to my wife, Michelle Obama, for putting up with me.  We will be celebrating our 15th anniversary next week, and she just about has me trained  almost.  This statement from Michelle Obama's spokesperson, quote, 16th, unquote. 
[01:05:00]  16th anniversary, not 15th.  Oops.  You know what?  Wow.  This Michelle Obama.  What are you doing?  Yeah, yeah.  Way to help out your man.  You know what I mean?  I'm so not into her.  What do we got?  Like 30 days left?  Something like that?  A little more than 30 days left?  Shut your trap.  Yeah, they've been keeping her out of the public eye.  She was everywhere, but now...  Because you know everyone's going to use your soundbite and then make, you know, your  husband look bad, you dummy. 
[01:05:30]  Shut your mouth.  She was everywhere at the beginning of this whole thing, and now they tucked her away  somewhere to shut her up because she's that loose cannon that could just derail everything.  She's a little, um, meh, a little free thinking.  You want to see some fireworks?  You should get Michelle Obama and Sarah Palin on the same stage.  Oh!  Oh, it would be a bunch of phony, cordial crap. 
[01:06:00]  You think?  Yeah.  With, with, with, her little mouth.  That stupid little mouth of hers.  Ugh.  I know.  She just looks...  I do not like Michelle Obama.  Oh, boy.  Palin's against abortion.  Well, I mean, you know.  Well...  Who wants that?  You're not going to get that.  The vice president isn't going to start, you know, legislating abortion.  But they are the ones that put in the, they're the ones that will stock the Supreme Court. 
[01:06:30]  You're probably right.  And look, I think the pro-lifers are right, to be very honest with you.  In God's eyes or whatever, they're right.  But the bottom line is, I'm not sterile.  So I would like the option.  Right.  If one of you little dumbbells calls up, I'll pick you up and we'll go for soup after.  You know, Sarah Palin talks about the average Joe, or Joe Sixpack.  Joe Sixpack loves abortions.  Oh, yeah.  He loves them.  He needs them.  He needs them available.  Joe Sixpack drinks one, bangs a girl who's too fat to have his kid, and then wants to 
[01:07:00]  take her to the clinic for a little vacuuming.  Way to know about Joe Sixpack.  Get one of those abortions.  Joe Sixpack.  He doesn't like them, Jimmy.  Nope.  Hey, Rat, I'm kind of busy over here.  He loves them.  Loves abortions.  Loves it.  I don't know.  If you ask me, I think the Supreme Court could be packed with conservatives, and it still  wouldn't overturn Roe versus Wade.  It's one of those things that it's such a very sensitive subject with the American people, 
[01:07:30]  and it's so divided, you know, and pretty evenly so in this country, that I don't think you  can make that kind of decision and not have some kind of revolution on your hand with something  that sensitive with people, you know?  Thank you.  Very good.  Here's George Carlin.  I'm voting, finally.  And secondly, I don't vote, because I believe if you vote, you have no right to complain. 
[01:08:00]  People like to twist that around.  I know.  They say, well, if you don't vote, you have no right to complain.  But where's the logic in that?  If you vote, and you elect dishonest, incompetent people, and they get into office and screw  everything up, well, you are responsible for what they have done.  You caused the problem.  You voted them in.  You have no right to complain.  I, on the other hand, who did not vote, who did not vote, who, in fact, did not even  leave the House on Election Day, am in no way responsible for what these people have done 
[01:08:30]  and have every right to complain as loud as I want about the mess you created that I had  nothing to do with.  That I had nothing to do with.  Such a brilliant, brilliant point.  That's great.  He could twist that right around.  It sucks.  He's gone, man.  So, I know that a little later on this year, you're going to have another one of those  really swell presidential elections that you like so much.  You'll enjoy yourselves.  It'll be a lot of fun.  I'm sure as soon as the election is over, your country will improve immediately. 
[01:09:00]  As for me, I'll be home on that day doing essentially the same thing as you.  The only difference is, when I get finished, I'm going to have a little something to show  for it, folks.  Thank you very much.  Brilliant.  Brilliant.  You know what?  Why don't we go to break with another clip from Carlin, all right?  We got Louis C.K. coming in today?  Yep.  Very cool.  I think he's going to be here any moment.  Then we got a handwriting analysis coming in to see what our intern David's all about.  She's calling in, I think, right? 
[01:09:30]  Oh, she's calling in?  Okay.  Our Jewish intern, David.  I certainly hope she's seen it.  She's seen his handwriting, right?  Okay.  Yeah.  And then we got Dennis Hoff stopping by later with Air Force Amy.  Oh, from the Vineyard show.  Yeah, very cool.  Oh.  But we go to break with another clip from the great George Carlin.  Now, there's one thing you might have noticed I don't complain about.  Politicians.  Everybody complains about politicians.  Everybody says they suck. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Well, where do people think these politicians come from?  They don't fall out of the sky.  They don't pass through a membrane from another reality.  They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools,  American churches, American businesses, and American universities.  And they're elected by American citizens.  This is the best we can do, folks.  This is what we have to offer.  It's what our system produces.  Garbage in, garbage out.  But if you have selfish, ignorant citizens, if you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're 
[01:10:30]  going to get selfish, ignorant leaders.  And term limits ain't going to be any good.  You're just going to wind up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans.  So maybe, maybe, maybe it's not the politicians who suck.  Maybe something else sucks around here.  Like the public.  Yeah, the public sucks.  There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody.  The public sucks.  Hope.  Hope. 
[01:11:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  In studio, one of our favorite comedians, Louis C.K.  Oh, thank you.  We got to do this carefully, Louis.  Okay.  We got Jim Norton's HBO show starting tonight at midnight after Bill Maher.  Down and Dirty.  That's tonight.  HBO.  Yeah.  Now we go to Louis.  Saturday, it's chewed up on Showtime. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  Right?  So the listeners could check out both.  That's good.  You didn't put us in a weird position.  No, you can watch both.  You can watch Steve-O anyway.  These days, man, you can find the man.  There's a million ways.  Norton Friday, Louis Saturday.  That's right.  By the way, Showtime, you can get it now for eight bucks, I think.  Yeah, but Showtime's for queers.  It's HBO.  It's pretty much.  Uh-huh.  I never purported not to be a queer.  I'm fine with it.  We are.  We are.  We love that word. 
[01:12:00]  Queer.  We can't use it enough.  Queer.  Queer.  It's a two-syllable word in Boston.  Queer.  Queer.  Queer.  Queer.  And for the people that could really put more info in their brain, unlike myself, tonight,  Bergen County Performance Arts Center with Louis C.K., Inglewood, New Jersey.  Yes, sir.  201-227-1030 for tickets to see Louis tonight.  That's where I shot the, that's where we shot. 
[01:12:30]  You shot what?  9-30.  We shot at Bergen.  What are you talking, what is that?  It's a thing that's on a place, but that was shot.  That's a great space to do a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  I'm really glad you added that.  Well, no, I'm just saying I've been there.  Right.  That's great.  I'm so glad to know that you've been there.  Yeah.  It's really going to help tonight.  It was full when I did it.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, when you have HBO buying your audience for five bucks a piece.  It was free tickets.  Nothing.  It didn't cost them nothing. 
[01:13:00]  I mean that they paid them five bucks a piece.  No, they didn't.  They probably did, seriously.  What?  Go ahead.  Yeah, we're going to get away from the politics for just a second or two here because it is  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Now, a lot of stations do Rocktober.  I mean, it's been a staple of hack radio stations forever.  We don't even know what it means.  It's like all of a sudden it goes from September 30th to October 1st, and then they change to, 
[01:13:30]  hey, all month long it's Rocktober, and nothing changes.  It's just Rocktober.  Just Rocktober.  They're giving you a little more for your money.  A little more oomph.  Are they?  In the Rock Department.  Yeah, that's what they say on their websites.  I don't see it.  I think when they say Rocktober also, they usually say it with some emphasis.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's an excitement about the month.  There's a gravelliness in the voice usually that says Rocktober.  A lot of lasers are slow.  Rocktober.  That, I love that.  I love that.  I love the way that feels when I hear it.  That is pretty good. 
[01:14:00]  A lot of echoes, a lot of lasers.  Pew, pew, pew.  Rocktober.  But we're not going to do that.  We did E-Rocktober.  We did E-Rocktober where we paid tribute to our own buffoon, Eric.  That didn't take long.  No.  And then we figured we'd do Jocktober, which is paying tribute to other programs.  This is very rare on the radio.  You don't really see one show paying tribute to other shows.  No.  Why do we do it?  Because the other shows suck.  They suck so bad that we have to bring people's attention to these shows to make us feel better 
[01:14:30]  about ourselves and our show.  Well, that's what it's about.  You know how it is.  As a comic, you love seeing another comic on stage just bombing.  Sure.  Just eating their nads.  It's the best feeling.  Can I ask Louie a question about what, Anthony, you just said?  You did a set when Ricky Gervais came to the Comedy Cellar to see Louie.  And Louie went up and just murdered.  Mm-hmm.  And then Bob Kelly went on after Louie. 
[01:15:00]  That's right.  And didn't murder.  That's a nice way to put it, I guess.  He was on the other side of the verb.  Well, Bobby's a funny guy, but that's the weird thing about comedy that I've learned.  I've never done one stand-up night in my life, but one thing I know, knowing you guys, it  happens to all of you.  I don't know how that dynamic works that a brilliant comic, every comic, I don't care  how brilliant they are, has a story or a few stories about how they just friggin' tanked. 
[01:15:30]  Yep.  Well, he was...  Bombed.  Bob was eating it good after.  I would say he wasn't totally dying, but he was...  What, before he hit the stage?  What was it, chicken franchise?  What was he eating good?  He, uh...  It was kind of a munching, but it wasn't eating the dignity of a complete vomit.  Oh, no.  You didn't go, I just went down and flamed.  Yeah.  You didn't.  It was a tittering...  It was an awkward, upsetting...  You know, the thing was that he defeated himself. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  He's got mental problems because...  Ricky was there, he was probably very nervous.  Ricky was there, and he was already starting his face...  He had no control over his face.  Like, he just was flinching and had a weird smile that made no sense on his face.  And, uh, I went on and I just had...  I was inspired by Ricky being there.  I wanted to show him a good show, and I had a...  I plowed the place.  The thing is that when somebody kills and you go on next, you should do great.  Right.  It's all in your head.  You should pick up on the energy and do great, no matter who they are.  So, the trick I always used to love is when Seinfeld would come into the cellar, because 
[01:16:30]  Seinfeld goes on and kills, but you can totally kill after him.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Because you're more excited, actually, than he is.  You're more into it than he is.  Yeah, yeah.  But so, Bob, as he's going on stage, he's like, oh, oh, this is going to suck.  Oh, I was defeated before he got out there.  He ruined himself, because every time he actually...  He's right.  He's...  Yeah, well, yeah.  Every time he started to get anything going, he'd say something embarrassing and ruin it.  That's too bad.  People would start laughing, and then he'd say something horrible. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  But anyway, Ricky and I were sitting together, and we're laughing at him because of how bad  he's doing it.  You don't want to be laughed at.  No.  No, not by...  And he loves Ricky, and I'm watching...  Because, also, he's telling all these stories that are about things his therapist said to  him, but he forgot to set up his therapist as a person.  He just goes...  And I've seen him do the bits.  He just goes, anyway...  So, then he says this, and the audience is looking at each other like, who?  And so, now he's bombing, because he left out a massive piece of information that drives 
[01:17:30]  20 minutes of his act.  And Ricky and I realized this, and I whispered to Ricky, and we were both laughing about it.  But then, at one point, Bob was bombing really bad, and he looked out at the audience with  this weird, I hate myself look that lasted a really long time, and Ricky just laughed, because  of how crazy that was, that a person would do that.  Yeah.  That's a tough spot for...  But then, so later, we're outside, and Robert Kelly comes up to us and goes... 
[01:18:00]  I mean, just does the work...  Instead of just kind of going, ah, well, he goes, so I heard you guys laughing at a point  where I hadn't told a joke, so I feel real bad, because I heard Ricky laughing.  And he says, and Ricky just turns white and goes, oh, God, no, it was something else, and...  Oh, oh, ooh.  Ricky should have just brutalized him.  Yeah.  He was looking at you.  That's a great bombing.  Because you were falling like Joe Kittinger in 1960.  You're bombing in dollars and pounds.  Oh, that's great.  Let's bring it back to Jocktober, so that's the point we're making. 
[01:18:30]  We enjoy when other radio shows do awful radio, right?  Here's the official sweeper of Jocktober.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to rock!  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  Blocking the berries and sweetest of juice, baby!  There's a lot of energy there for some reason, but it's like wasted energy.  Yeah.  It's like sitting in your driveway in neutral and just gassing it. 
[01:19:00]  Back up the crap-o-luck.  It's Jocktober.  There's a person stranded.  There's a show.  There's a show.  It's stranded.  My rebuttal is, yo, mama.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I like that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The hell was that?  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ha, ha, ha.  Let's all do it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  There's no joy attached to that sound. 
[01:19:30]  None.  Wow, very good.  Yeah.  You think there's a lot of shows right now just going,  oh, please, don't be me.  I don't want it to be me.  Don't be me.  Yeah.  Well, we announced today's show.  Sam, who are we mocking today?  Mockober.  Today's show is the Chrisman Morning Show,  also out of Central PA, like our friends from yesterday,  the People's Morning Show.  You know, it's a hotbed of activity, that part of Pennsylvania,  for Jocktober.  I guess so.  This was suggested by a listener who emailed it in. 
[01:20:00]  Chrisman or Chrisman?  Chrisman.  Okay.  Yeah, all right.  And what can you tell us about the Chrisman or Chrisman radio show?  It's basically the show that every sketch comedy show and movie  has ever made fun of.  It's that jockey voice and the hole that we all make fun of, 100%.  Oh, we got a hole?  Of course we have a hole.  You want to explain the hole to Louie?  Yeah, you might know by now.  The hole is the mandatory woman involved on the radio show, right? 
[01:20:30]  Oh, come on, don't.  Guys.  You guys always.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh.  Yeah, so this old lady, she was eating cat food.  Oh, that's not very nice.  She's probably a nice woman that can't afford food.  You know, the frigging water on the fire.  That's it.  Anytime anything gets going, the big sweaty, greasy hand on that brake handle on the train. 
[01:21:00]  Just stop any bit of fun.  It's the yield sign.  Yeah.  It's the yield sign for every bit.  Her uterus is like when you rip the space helmet off an astronaut and it just sucks all  the funny right out of the room.  It's just a hole.  A hole.  There's a vortex of funny.  There's a big problem.  Yeah, with slippery sides and smelly parts.  There's a big problem in the business.  Like, the radio executives, they insist on having a woman on every morning show, except  for ours.  I think we're one of the few.  We refuse to go there. 
[01:21:30]  You can't have yield sign.  Except for Jimmy.  You have to just go for it.  You can't slow down and look around and make sure it's going to be okay.  You just got to barrel ahead.  With that, are we ready?  Anything else you want to add in the intro there, Sam?  Well, they have a stunt boy, I guess, whose name is Rod the Boy.  We don't really hear much from him.  I think in one clip you can kind of hear him in the background, but not much excitement  from Rod the Boy this morning.  It's the formula.  You need a stunt boy, and you've got to call him stunt boy. 
[01:22:00]  Stunt boy.  You need the hole.  Yeah.  And you need your Gary Chrisman.  And you need your Gary Chrisman.  All right.  Gary, who's the host here, right?  Yes.  He yawns during Gale's weather.  Well, yeah, because Gale's our hole for the day.  All right.  Gale does the weather, and she catches Gary yawning.  That's going to cause a little friction.  It opens a can of worms.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That must have been so embarrassing for him.  The weekend looks great, too.  Low 60s and sunshine, both Saturday and Sunday. 
[01:22:30]  Am I keeping you awake, Gary?  Huh?  Who?  I'm hearing this yawning in my ear.  I'm a little...  I'm not starting out real well.  You want me to jump in?  I don't know if I've ever been called boring.  I'm kind of boring with what you're saying.  Obviously.  Oh, oh, man.  You tell it's Friday.  Oh, you've got to be kidding me.  What time is it?  Oh, I don't want any part of this stuff. 
[01:23:00]  I don't know.  Let's call in today.  Let's not even go in.  This sucks.  I understand why...  Boring.  I understand why she's laughing.  Oh, you do, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  It's funny stuff.  All right, good.  But why is he not enjoying it?  Yeah, that's the weird thing.  They're on two different pages.  They're out of sync with each other.  They suck.  If I woke up one morning and my neighbors were saying those things through the wall, I would  call the local radio station and complain. 
[01:23:30]  He started the show back in January of 1976.  Yes, his bio is on their web page.  And the bio says that he's celebrating the 30th anniversary of the show, which obviously  means the bio hasn't been updated in two years.  But yeah, so 32 years of the Chrisman Morning Show.  In the middle of nowhere, Pennsylvania.  Central.  God, kill yourself.  Just kill yourself live on the show.  The play Filling It In with a Hilarious Caller. 
[01:24:00]  What's that about?  Well, they have a game.  It's called Filling It In.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  And what they do is they'll throw two blanks in a sentence and then just open it up to  the listeners and say...  You're kidding me.  It's like Mad Libs, only nuttier.  Wow.  That sounds crazy, Sam.  All right.  All right.  Just because I'm a soccer mom, doesn't mean I'm a vice president. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You're going to be kidding me.  She's right, though.  That's not what that's about.  It's not to be mean like that.  Come on, guys.  It's supposed to be fun.  What is that?  I'm not a soccer mom.  I can't be vice president.  Yeah, what if she was listening?  Wow.  That's edgy.  For the record, that clip, they felt so strongly about that clip that it was in the podcast  section in the best of. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, it was.  So that would be cream of the crop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was the actual...  I don't know.  Let's see if they answer that question.  All right.  Create a joke.  Just because I'm...  A soccer mom.  A soccer mom doesn't mean I'm...  A vice president.  Oh.  Or a hockey mom.  Boo.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, filling it in.  Thanks a lot.  Ladies and gentlemen, filling it in.  Oh, it is.  Well, we're filling it in tonight.  Filling it in. 
[01:25:30]  How about we fill in the...  We fill in your mouth.  With a...  And make sure we spray some...  Just because I'm a...  I'm a...  Doesn't mean I'm a...  Right.  God, that's just asking for trouble.  Sure is.  Did you hear the hole?  Oh.  Oh.  What?  Oh.  That's the yield sign right there.  Well, all right.  Oh.  All right.  I'll let you get away with that, but let's not go any further, guys.  Oh.  Oh.  I know.  Oh, it's just the worst.  They're terrible.  That sound is actually coming out from between her legs rather than her mouth, I think. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Holy moly.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's the...  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I just figured something out, though.  They mean Sarah Palin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No way.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  I just figured that out.  They're lampooning Sarah Palin, vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party.  Right.  Oh, my God.  God, see, we weren't quick enough to pick up on that, and that's why it wasn't that funny. 
[01:26:30]  I'm surprised that wasn't dumped, because that was really irreverent.  I'm surprised they didn't dump out on that.  Oh, we're getting info on this show, that...  The Chrisman Morning Show.  The Chrisman Morning Show.  We've got Sarah in PA.  Sarah?  Hi.  Hi.  Good to love you, guys.  You're not another Sarah Palin, are you?  You know.  Oh.  So, I used to live in central Pennsylvania, where the show's out of, and Gary Chrisman actually  does the voice for Rod the Boy.  So, there actually isn't an extra stunt boy, it's actually Gary Chrisman. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, no.  No, stop.  Oh, no.  He plays the part of...  Oh, false advertising.  ...in a dramatic dual role.  Yes.  In the beginning clip, we hear, when he's yawning and she's saying something, we hear  someone in the background...  We're going to take over?  Yeah, that guy, right?  Is that Rod the Stunt Boy?  I would assume that that would have to be Rod the Boy.  It's not a...  There's no more cast members.  No.  Exactly.  The high-pitched voice, that's Rod the Boy.  We played that... 
[01:27:30]  Did you hear the clip of the yawn?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, punch out.  Oh, you want to hear it again?  Yeah, no, yeah, I want to hear him do it.  I was asking her if that's what she meant.  Now, is he...  Is it because he's stupid, or is he ripping off Phil Hendry?  Because Phil Hendry does that.  Yeah, where he does other people.  Phil Hendry has a guy in his studio that he just keeps...  Who goes, hi, what if I do?  And he goes, shut up.  Yeah.  Like, he just keeps...  He was brilliant at it.  He was great, yeah.  Yeah, you got to give him props.  Phil Hendry's show is really good.  I don't know if he's on anymore.  I think he's retired.  I heard he retired.  That's what I heard, too.  Great.  The weekend looks great, too. 
[01:28:00]  Low 60s and sunshine, both Saturday and Sunday.  Am I keeping you awake, Gary?  Uh-uh.  Who?  I'm hearing this yawning in my ear.  I'm a little...  I'm not starting out real well.  You want me to jump in?  I know.  Is that...  That's him.  That has to be him.  That's him doing it.  So does he do this, like...  You want me to jump in?  I'll get it.  Oh, but I'm so...  Yeah.  Oh, I'm so...  But I want me to jump in. 
[01:28:30]  I'll jump in.  And for the rest of this bit...  What the hell is...  For the rest of this bit, could you play the part of our stunt boy?  Just some new...  Just even call him stunt boy.  Yeah, Ted the stunt boy.  Yeah, Ted the stunt boy.  Hey, wait a minute!  I don't know.  Should we play another clip?  This is funny stuff.  This is a little rough.  This is going great!  Yeah, it sure is.  It sure is.  These guys were a little sadder than the over-enthusiastic, like, market-pushing jerks.  You didn't tell...  This guy's just old and dying. 
[01:29:00]  You didn't tell us they're on one of those KISS stations.  Every city has to have a KISS.  Right.  Has to have a KISS FM.  Yes, Central PA's own KISS 1027.  Well, their slogan is Big Hits, Big Fun.  Which is what the Chrisman show is all about.  Wow.  Sure sounds it.  Yeah.  Crazy caller interactions.  All right, here we go.  Describing SNL, we learn about the show's humor.  Yeah, kind of.  Because they say what they think is funny, so we can kind of figure out where their jokes  are coming from.  All right.  Ah, okay, good. 
[01:29:30]  Scott, tomorrow's edition of Saturday Night Live could be really funny.  It's going to be a satirical version of Last Night's Debate, and Queen Latifah is going  to play the moderator.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  That, I bet, is going to be sassy.  I know.  And the really sickening part is that that's actually what SNL is going to do.  They're going to have Queen Latifah on.  That's it?  I'm sure.  Because nothing happened, and because that woman, there's nothing to say about that woman.  Well, Queen Latifah, like, if you really need a sassy gal. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, yeah, you got it.  Just get her.  She's the go-to sassy.  Oh, she's good.  She really is.  But, uh...  White people, get out of her way, white people.  More importantly, why are they reading TV Guide live on their show?  This is Hollywood gossip, Opie.  Oh.  Oh.  This is as close as they can get.  That's true.  I thought they were just reading TV.  Guess what I heard?  Flip, flip, flip.  Uh, Frazier is doing a rerun where...  Right.  I'm going to play the moderator.  That should be pretty good. 
[01:30:30]  I'll be anxious to see that.  And the thing is, I have got to make sure I'm recording these.  Yeah.  Because I missed it last time.  I was at the Illinois game and missed it, forgot to tape it.  Right.  Yeah, that's the thing.  Wow.  She says, the thing is that.  The thing is.  It's got a lot of them into your personal life like that.  They like to know their habits and what you do.  Yeah.  Big fan of Illinois.  All right.  Not everybody had tickets to that game, too.  I like the fact that I had tickets.  Gary loves football.  It's all about trying to be local.  These things are...  You know, when guys listen, they're like, oh, I was at the game, too. 
[01:31:00]  I like that guy.  I'm going to listen to Mauro.  I can relate to this guy because I was at the same game.  I was at the game, too.  Oh, this sucks.  I like my gadgets.  I like my games.  What kind of gadgets do you like there, Gary?  Well, I like the ones where you tape the SNL while you're at the game.  Yeah.  And so when I listen to that guy, I'm like, yeah, he's got a DVR and he goes to Illinois.  I got to be the same guy listening to him tomorrow morning.  Yeah.  I had a cable box, but, you know, I used to have the TiVo. 
[01:31:30]  Now I use the cable box.  I use the cable box, too.  Oh, stunt boy, you just calm down back there.  I'll handle this.  That's the thing is.  That's the thing?  Yeah.  That's the thing.  That's the thing that's what one must consider.  Meanwhile, he wasn't at the Illinois game.  He was probably parked outside like an all-night little gas station.  I'm marked, figuring out a way to kidnap and rape a girl who works behind the town alone. 
[01:32:00]  And then yet again, chickening out and going back to his lousy wife.  He's afraid there's a security camera that he can't quite get a hold of, that he won't  be able to black out.  He's a creep, this guy.  He's in his car with a teen magazine in the back of the Walmart parking lot.  They keep pulling him over as passengers.  He's been ripped out.  And they go, oh, God, it's you again.  Well, you're going to give me a break right there, Ralph.  Your brother and I went to high school together.  I'll take him to the game of the Illinois game if you don't arrest me for child molesting. 
[01:32:30]  What a creep of Christmas.  That's going local, though, knowing the name of the cop in the town.  He's been around very long.  Sure.  At some point, they get so tired listening to him that a cop does go ahead and arrest  him for his 500th public masturbation.  Like, that's why those guys suddenly get caught.  They've been doing it all along.  Yeah.  But their local public goes like, just already arrest him now. 
[01:33:00]  It's not an end to this.  Enough already.  For some reason, the sponsors won't toss him.  Hey, you got some debate funny here there, Sam, from today's show, huh?  Yeah, well, I mean, they like to keep it topical because, you know, they like to relate to the  people that are listening.  So, everybody's talking about the debate this morning.  Sure, it's hot stuff.  Yeah, the Christmas morning show is no different.  All right.  The people out there can compare what they did with the debate with what we did with  the debate earlier.  Sure.  By the way, Jeff M. from Staten Island, he's pleading. 
[01:33:30]  He's saying, Opie, be nice to the whole, she only has 16 friends on MySpace.  That's not true.  How can you only have 16 friends?  Well, I think she'll have more after today.  What's the MySpace address?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Their debate material.  Add her.  What is this again?  The Christmas morning show?  The Christmas morning show.  And what is it?  Big hits?  Big fun?  Yeah, it's big fun.  All right, but when you got the big hits, this must be the big fun we're about to hear.  It's coming at you.  By the way, real quick, you know what I'm hitting?  I turn around the dial because in a little bit, I, because I made a point to record it 
[01:34:00]  and not watch because I was working on something.  So, I flipped it on.  His radio voice.  Again, he's going to let you know his TiVo.  By the way, the point, I turn around the dial.  I made a point of recording it so I wouldn't watch.  I often, I really, I love the TiVo.  I had an issue because I was also taping Project Runway and John and Kate Plus 8.  I didn't know what to do.  I had a bell on one of them to get the debate on my DVR.  I usually go with the other one. 
[01:34:30]  What was that?  The America's Top Model.  Oh, yeah.  The Tyra Banks.  Yeah, that one.  Good, good.  All right.  That was the one.  By the way, yet again, interjecting the pithiest possible angle.  By the way, real quick, you know what I'm hitting?  Real quick.  I turned around the dial because in a little bit, I made a point to record it and not watch  because I was working on something.  So I flipped it on out of curiosity.  What does he have to do that he can't watch the most important thing?  I was working on something. 
[01:35:00]  That was like, you know how many people watched that debate last night?  I was trying to hook a little toilet cam up in the men's room off of Route 380 and it  kept breaking because of a splatter.  Someone has the question why he wasn't watching the debate last night.  This was his job.  When you do mornings, you have responsibilities.  You really do.  Like, all right, I got to watch the debate a little bit.  Everyone's going to be talking about it today.  So we should have an angle on it.  You know what he was doing?  Because he says he was working. 
[01:35:30]  So what he was doing was coming up with a way to work his DVR experiences.  Listen, you know what, tomorrow what I'm going to do is tell him that I didn't, I was avoiding  watching it because I was working.  That's the one way of saying why I was taping.  I need to know what flat screen he has.  I'm dying to know.  I need to know.  He spent hours talking to the local kid about the flat screen.  Is it better though?  Which one, what should I go with?  It doesn't, sir.  They're all basically made in the same fashion.  Plasma, LCD. 
[01:36:00]  Right, but what, yeah.  Which one's the better one?  And sometimes I get some glare in my living room on the wall where the TV's going to be.  How will the glare affect the picture?  Which kind does the chief of police have?  Because I don't want to be on par with him.  He makes $29,000 a year.  Yes, chief of police O'Grady.  I had dinner with him one night.  I had the steak.  He had some seafood, I believe it was.  I've got to relate to the common man.  If I go 42, 45 inches, is that going to seem a little pompous to mine? 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, I don't tell him about the 45 inch.  Sure, I tell him about the 32 I have.  Right.  Because that's more the TV my listeners would have.  Yeah.  You over-calculating douche.  I was working on something, so I flipped it on out of curiosity.  Did you?  And I go by Gail's favorite, the Hum Shopping Network.  The woman on the Hum Shopping Network looks just like her.  Oh, you're kidding.  For a minute, I double-take that.  Everybody's trying to look like her now.  I turned back.  Yeah, she's right, though.  I mean, we make fun of her, but she's right. 
[01:37:00]  It's true.  She's got, she hit it on the head.  Yeah.  She is the George Carlin of that, of whatever she's just talking about just now.  The thing is, he's saying what he just said, like he can't stop from, he's almost in pain  because he's going to laugh so hard.  Yeah.  Trying to look like her now.  I turned back and I said, my God, Sarah Palin, she's not really in the debate.  She's in the Hum Shopping Network.  Or you thought it was the worst debate ever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was like, what kind of debate is this?  She's selling.  She's selling. 
[01:37:30]  She's selling jewelry or something.  I thought she was going to come out at one point and say, oh, okay, so, I made you a casserole.  Oh, my God, we're having a time here.  That's hilarious.  Casserole.  A casserole.  She's making a casserole.  Oh, good gravy. 
[01:38:00]  Jack Tober is making fools out of us.  This is a funny show.  I know.  It's a damn funny show.  I've been on shows like this where they laugh that hard, and then the instant the mics are  off, they just turn into pieces of miserable stone.  Just sit there.  Can you give me some coffee?  I hate having, like, when they want you to do a joke.  Getting a Marlboro light outside in the cold.  They give you, like, a nine on a joke that deserves, like, a three.  It's embarrassing.  You're like, yeah, and then my plane was like, ah, what happened?  Stumbag, my plane was like. 
[01:38:30]  Late plane.  Right, that wasn't the joke, you idiot.  That was the setup.  Can we please hear the casserole?  Late plane.  Strap me to a wing.  I'm the stunt boy.  Are you?  Jackass.  Who knew casseroles?  Sorry, it could be so fun.  Casseroles are hysterical by nature.  Oh, of course they are.  You don't even have to put them in a situation.  This got the same laugh that Pryor's bit about his father punching him in the chest got  in 1979.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't think that bit could get, anything could get a laugh like that. 
[01:39:00]  Or Woody Allen's, uh.  I almost said most of it again, but I can't.  This is Eddie Murphy's Goonie Goo Goo bit.  Yes, Eddie Murphy's fart material.  Yes, yes.  Didn't get a laugh like that.  No.  Is that her, by the way?  From children.  Do you want to go all the way back or just a little bit?  Ah, we'll go back to this point.  Yeah.  What's going to do?  She's selling jewelry or something.  I thought she was going to come out at one point and say, oh, okay, so Joel, I made you  a casserole.  Be more funny.  That's funny. 
[01:39:30]  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Good stuff.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  When someone says that's funny, good stuff, it means that's not funny.  It's bad stuff.  Right.  Like, it's the exact opposite of what it was said.  I was only joking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think the thought...  That's funny.  The idea, too, is that she did a little bit of a voice there.  She did a little bit of that Fargo voice.  Oh, yeah.  That was it.  Oh, I made you a casserole, Joel. 
[01:40:00]  A casserole.  I get it.  Here's a casserole with a Moe Howard wig.  When you work in, like, nightcrawlers into the casserole bit, maybe?  Yeah.  A little bit, if you really want to go...  Oh, Margie, you brought me some nightcrawlers.  In a casserole.  In a casserole.  I thought she was going to come out at one point and say,  Oh, okay, so Joel, I made you a casserole.  That's funny.  Good stuff.  Hey, now, there you go.  There's a little improv stand-up for you. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  Yes, it was.  There you go.  There you go.  We're just as good as they are.  There you go.  You see?  You're not so special.  There's a little improv stand-up kind of wacky skit.  That's what they do.  That's all they do, really.  Wow.  Whenever I walk into a room, people yell,  You stupid casserole.  Or something like that.  I did, too.  Oh, my God.  We thought this Jocktober bit was going to get old fast.  Oh, not even close.  That guy is just... 
[01:41:00]  There you go.  There you go.  That's some of that improv stand-up stuff.  There you go.  That's just so easy.  You should get cancer of the gums.  Oh, my God.  We need a really good show out of Boston to goof on.  Oh, yeah.  And definitely Cleveland.  We had a good show out of Boston just based on pictures.  Yeah.  But there's no online stream.  All right.  Don't even say the show just in case we could get it somewhere else.  We'd like these to be a big surprise.  Yeah.  Sure.  Hey, now, there you go.  There's a little improv stand-up for you. 
[01:41:30]  And I don't say that to offend or not, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Be careful.  Oh, no.  I don't...  Oh, my God.  She actually...  She actually was worried that she's going to have to do one of those apologies with lots  of microphones in front of her.  Like, anybody cares.  I don't mean to offend when I said casserole.  To all casserole Americans out there...  If you're married to a casserole, I don't mean to call you a casserole lover.  Casserole lover. 
[01:42:00]  You know, maybe you're a size queen and we all know casseroles are the bulls in the cuckold  relationship.  I love the discussion about the bull.  The casserole coalition comes in.  The bull does what?  No.  What is the cuckold?  Services the bull.  Services the bull.  He prepares the bull.  Prep that bull.  Yeah.  Prep some.  I think we're done, guys.  I mean, really.  I think we made our point with this show, right?  Is there more of this show?  There's a little more.  I think we've got to give it a day. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  What the hell?  Let's just see what's around the corner.  They do more funny stuff.  Sam, by the way, just to bring you into this, he's a sarcastic mother effer and how he lists  these tracks are terrific, too.  He writes, Sam, they do more funny stuff now with Dancing with the Stars.  This clip illustrates exactly what a hole is.  Yes.  We kind of bring it home.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  It's all about the hole on these shows.  I bet it gets a little bit, well, you know, and she stops.  Here we go.  Thank God.  Dancing with the Stars fans are going to be unhappy about this. 
[01:43:00]  Two-time Indy 500 winner and champion of Dancing with the Stars, Elio Castronovas, was  indicted yesterday on six counts of tax evasion.  He's 33.  He's single.  He lives in Coral Gables, Florida.  But they said, if found guilty, he could get 10 years in federal prison.  Man, can you imagine?  No, I cannot.  He's such a pretty boy.  I don't know how long he would last in prison.  Tell you one thing.  He'd teach some guys how to dance in that.  Yeah, that's true. 
[01:43:30]  He could do that.  That's all he needs is to win the Dance of the Stars competition at the federal pen.  That's not even funny.  Oh, man.  Well, she got that right.  Yeah.  All right.  One point for her, for the whole.  That's not even funny.  I'm quitting.  That's not even funny.  And she didn't even mean.  She's like, what do you mean, my joke?  No, this whole show, I'm leaving.  This sucks.  I quit.  Yes.  She didn't even mean it like, you know, look, that's not even funny.  No.  She meant like, that's not even funny. 
[01:44:00]  Like, hey, don't go there.  Yeah.  Don't go there.  The dance competition in prison.  I bet there'd be a lot of f***ing over there.  Yeah, he'd have a black war helmet on his nose.  Oh, that's not even funny.  This is the thing.  Oh, come on.  These people, their humor is the most simple arithmetic in the world.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  That's a great hole.  They go, a guy from Dancing of the Stars is going to federal prison equals, well, he's 
[01:44:30]  going to teach the dancing of the people in that prison.  That's it.  That's what they got.  Yeah, that's it.  Now, guys, let's not make fun of people.  Such a perfect hole.  That captures the complete essence of the hole.  Let's not make fun of people.  That's Janine on Long Island.  Guys.  A regular at FH Riley.  She rules.  Oh, that's great.  All right. 
[01:45:00]  Well, we made our point.  That's today's Jocktober.  Wow.  We're really late for a break.  It was well worth it, though, I think.  Yes.  Jocktober is such a success so far.  Instead of doing a radio show, that guy needs to die of AIDS.  Oh, come on, Louie.  Come on, Louie.  Louie.  Louie, what?  Now stop us.  Stop.  That's not funny.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  Mm-hmm.  Lou.  No.  Oh, that was funny.  That's a good one.  That must have been like a husband-wife banter thing. 
[01:45:30]  And then she laughed.  Why a cucumber is better than a husband?  Awesome.  Why a slit pot roast is better than a wife?  Oh, good gravy.  That did sound like a rooster.  Oh, man, that's wonderful.  We're excited about Jocktober.  Sam, how did they get a hold of you with these crappy morning shows? 
[01:46:00]  Well, if you'd like your favorite morning show to participate in Jocktober, then email  Sam at OpieandAnthony.com.  You're getting a lot of people emailing, right?  The participation is just us playing your tape and goofing on your horrific show.  Yeah, the response has been huge thus far, so I think it's a hit.  We'll end with this.  More with Louis C.K.  Let's not forget.  Chewed Up, stand-up special.  We'll premiere on Showtime with Louis C.K. tomorrow night at 11 p.m. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, sir.  And now remember that, and then we move on, and let's talk about Jimmy.  HBO tonight after Bill Maher, Down and Dirty, Midnight.  Yeah, just think Jim Friday, Lou Saturday.  There you go.  Let's end the Jocktober bit with this.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to rock!  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  The block in the bay is the sweet of the jizz, baby! 
[01:47:00]  There was a lot of energy there for some reason, but it's like wasted energy.  Yeah.  It's like sitting in your driveway in neutral and just gassing it.  Strike up the crapola, it's Jocktober.  There's a person stranded!  There's a show!  There's a show!  It's stranded!  My rebuttal is, yo mama!  I like that!  Oh, the most fun!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  What the hell was that?  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:47:30]  Ha, ha!  Let's all do it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  What?  There was no joy attached to that sound.  None.  Oh.  Hey, you got a chance to see Louis C.K. tonight.  Bergen County Performance Arts Center, Inglewood, New Jersey, for Louis C.K.  Tickets 201-227-1030.  And then tomorrow, right?  Paramount Center, Peekskill, New York.  That's right.  It's Poughkeepsie. 
[01:48:00]  Poughkeepsie?  Yeah.  Is it?  I think so.  It says Peekskill.  Peekskill.  It's that market.  It's like the Gibson market, I believe.  This is Paramount Center, Peekskill, New York.  That's right.  That's what the plug says for Louis tomorrow night.  You can actually see me there and then go home and watch Chewed Up on Showtime.  That's right.  Saturday night.  Now, how much Louis?  That's calling a Louis Saturday.  If you go and rent Shameless, my special from last year, and you watch it at home, and  then you come see me at the Paramount, and then you go watch Chewed Up, you'll see  three hours of comedy.  That's right.  All different. 
[01:48:30]  You know what?  As a fan of you guys, I love the fact that you're always working on new material.  There are guys, they come to New York, and they go to Caroline's or where have you, and  it's the same exact set from the year before, and these guys are hoping to make it.  It's like...  You can't keep doing it.  You got to keep working on new stuff.  Yep.  And I appreciate that as a fan of comedy, so...  What was I going to say?  Oh, and you killed opening up for Ricky Gervais.  I think we told you that last...  Yeah, that was fun.  I had a good time doing that.  You destroyed...  Thanks, man.  ...in front of his audience. 
[01:49:00]  Now, Anthony and Louie were watching TV, the Today Show.  Oh, God.  Everyone's talking about the Sarah Palin thing from last night, and you know what?  She did all right.  A lot of people thought she would get destroyed in this debate.  She kind of held her own.  But how is the news going to put their own little spin and take on it?  Yeah.  And the Today Show, they had to do a segment.  It just ended, because now they're cooking some dumb thing.  Got to have a cooking segment, right?  Of course.  It's the law.  It's so stupid.  But they had a bunch of women. 
[01:49:30]  I say, quote, women, because one of them was an animal.  Women.  I don't know what that was.  That was...  Pull that weave off, and oof.  Wow.  You got a mess.  Looked like a tranny, to be completely honest.  Really was an awful, awful creature.  And I looked over to Ant and Louie, and you guys were just going off.  What was the deal there?  Yeah, it's just the fact that they had to get the women's point of view.  Yeah, it was like the women, how women felt about Palin. 
[01:50:00]  How women felt about Palin's performance last night at the debate.  That was what they were cackling about.  And it's these four women.  And it's like, do they really want to separate themselves out from the human race that way?  Yeah.  More divisiveness.  Yeah, more just...  No, what did the women think?  And they're all...  We're not even hearing it, but you can tell with the sound off that they're just going...  I really felt like she stepped up there and really showed that a woman can blah blah blah blah with her vagina part.  Womanly, womanish, women, woman. 
[01:50:30]  Woman, woman.  Women, women, women, women, women's issues.  Women, women, women.  Shut up.  I think she did pretty good against that Joe Biden because he's a tough customer.  He's not...  He's a man instead of a woman.  Yeah, he's a man with a penis.  I felt that she really womened the woman women.  In a womanly, woman, woman way, women.  Very women, woman, women's issues.  And they're all sitting there with that cross-leg thing with the knees crossed because they're wearing a skirt. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, there's four of them.  And you don't want to just hang out and show, you know, what's the damage that's going on under there.  Four hens.  Oh, just cackling.  Four of them, like you need four of them to explain this.  Four women's point of view.  What about you, woman?  Oh, well, I thought that women, too.  That's interesting.  Yes, because it was a woman, women, woman.  Yeah.  And it's like, why not just look at it like, okay, here's the vice presidential candidate.  Yeah, and here's what happened.  Here's some people talking about it.  Right, but they got to, like, why aren't they talking about, you know, hey, that glass ceiling and, you know, let's get all on even footing here as far as the workplace goes and all this other stuff. 
[01:51:30]  And then right away, the news just has to get four cackling bitches out there to get that point of view.  Hey, they didn't get four blacks on the thing to see what Obama, hey, let's get four black people to see what you're doing.  Look at the black out of you.  I thought that he blacked the blackity black, black, black.  Excuse me.  I thought very black.  Did you look at the clock? 
[01:52:00]  It's a little early.  What happened?  You might see that about noon on the news.  You're right.  The blackity black, black.  I thought the blackity black, very black, and I feel that black could be black, that he blacked.  That's what I think.  Black, black, black.  Blackity black.  Speaking of which, I'm going to take this opportunity to do what's going on.  It's called the little radio seg, my friends.  I got good news for everyone.  We have a new Diddy blog.  Oh, my God, really?  A new Diddy blog? 
[01:52:30]  I love those.  You're into the Diddy blog?  Oh, totally.  That guy is proving that celebrities are all just giant yawns with diarrhea on their faces.  God, I hate that guy.  What an ass.  So you're on board with the Diddy blog?  Oh, I can't stand him.  We got an intro on everything, Lo.  Well, his name is Sean, but people call him Diddy.  And he's spouting of garbage that he thinks is so witty.  He became really famous when some gangster shot Biggie.  It's Puffy's latest video blog.  What's up, y'all? 
[01:53:00]  What's up, yo?  Love the intro.  Yeah.  Well, of course, Diddy has a lot to say about Sarah Palin.  Hmm.  Huh?  Huh?  He does.  Let's hear his unique point of view.  Let's hear his.  He is a moron.  Let's hear what you can only get from him.  Diddy blog number 24.  Sarah Palin.  Uh-oh.  She scares me.  She really scares me.  Likewise.  Look at this, boys and girls.  Watch this. 
[01:53:30]  And when it comes to establishing your worldview, I was curious, what newspapers and magazines  did you regularly read before you were tapped for this to stay informed and to understand  the world?  I read most of them, again, with a great appreciation for the press, for the media.  Like, what ones specifically, I'm curious, that you...  Um, all of them, any of them that have been in front of me over all these years.  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:00]  Is he getting tased?  What is that?  What is that?  What's going on there?  Oh, my God.  Boys and girls.  Boys and girls.  I just spent two seconds actually working for a living.  Did you hear her?  Did you?  I'm scared.  See?  Ah, Diddy, we get it.  What Pity's doing there is his, uh, Blair Witch project. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, is that what he did?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God's stock in his company has to be crumbling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How was it filmed?  There was a flashlight in the dark?  It's like he's, uh, in bed with a flashlight and he's telling ghost stories under the cover.  He's scared.  No, no, it's Blair Witch.  You put the flashlight under your face.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like she did.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  He's trying to do that.  Yeah.  But, um, wow, that looks like a shot out of one of those bank cameras. 
[01:55:00]  Don't you have another song to rip off?  Why are you bumming with this crap?  What a dumb person.  Uh, it continues with, uh, with this.  Of course it does.  So, you know.  Uh, she scares me.  She scares me.  I'm hiding under the covers.  She's watching the boogeyman.  The boogeyman?  Well, that would...  You want to go there, uh, good one.

Diddy  Whatever his company is  And he kept saying that  And I realized that he had probably just  Opened a loan out corporation  Right

Nobody  Nobody  Well the leftover candy  It's like trick or treat  No a lot of people don't have that  I remember kids that used to do that  The day after like  And then they'd have an excuse  Like  Yeah I was out of town 
[02:04:30]  Like with my parents  And they're always a little too old  To be trick or treating  Yeah  So like  I figured I'd come by today  Get out of here  You bum  Now you're just being a panhandler  You're a bum  Halloween is one day  Next day  Bum  I had a friend who we went  Trick or treating in like 7th grade  It was like that year too long  Yeah  A friend of mine  He dressed as Spider-Man  And he just went around  Stealing candy 
[02:05:00]  He waited till the end of the night  Oh good  And he just took kids candy  That's the easiest way to do it  It's the worst thing I've ever seen  He just would run up to kids  Leave them crying  Push their heads down in the dirt  He had just  And he didn't even like candy that much  He just took all their candy  And it's when I discovered  Something awful about myself  Because I never saw anything  That horrible in my life  I couldn't  I was lying on the ground  Because I couldn't stop laughing  I was like  I remember lying in grass  It sounds hysterical  Laughing and my stomach hurt  Just going 
[02:05:30]  Oh that's terrible  And I love it  Every second of it  It sounds hysterical to watch  It is amazing  Poor bastard  They're crying  I'm a bad person  That's when I realized  Yeah  I had my candy stolen once  Yeah  Yeah  Oh Jimmy  What happened Jimmy  I think I was just sitting at my friends  And one of the older boys  Ran by  He stole my stupid pillowcase 
[02:06:00]  Filled with candy  That's right  But I got him back  How'd you do that?  The next year I went to that same place  And I had my pillowcase  Full of dog turds  Oh  Nice little nuggets  I thought you were going to  You know  Do the soda cans in there  No  Pulling old bad boys  No but he didn't come by  So I just had to go home like that  And sleep on that pillow  With the pillowcase full of dog crap  And I ate them  They're delicious  Hey 
[02:06:30]  See rolls  There's a couple other things really fast  You have a mayor in Kansas  I would hope so  He apologized  He's apologizing today for  This made us laugh in the office  For going to a fundraiser  Which these mayors do  He went to the fundraiser  In drag and blackface  Politicians have to understand  Politicians  Public servants  Which you know  Fired police  You can't put on blackface anymore  Yeah  And be entertained  It is funny 
[02:07:00]  I must say  When I see somebody in blackface  I usually laugh  Sure  Not so much that it's funny  But just for the fact that  Oh my god  He's in so much trouble  Yes  Like that makes me laugh  Just knowing they're so screwed  And probably have just destroyed  Their career  Yeah  Yeah you can't  Who is he pretending to be?  Because he's in drag  When he was asked  Who is he trying to be  He commented  Un-  Oh I'm sorry  Was that not  Oh

[03:18:30]  Because the business  Was illegal until 72  My place has been there  Since 55  So they had a trailer  And they'd move it  Across the county line  Like we're one mile  From the county line  So one day  It's on one side  Of the county line  When there's no heat  And they can bribe  The sheriff  The next day  That sheriff  Gets political  They move it across  The other side  Of the county line  That's why they were mobile  That's how that started  That's a trailer  Trailer  With the wheels  Move them around  Yeah  Alright I get it  Because of the sheriff  Like the old west  It was the old west  Sounds like the old west
