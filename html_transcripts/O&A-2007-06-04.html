<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics.  It began with a recap of their trip to Washington D.C. for Jimmy Norton's HBO special.  Opie and Anthony detailed their train travel (instead of a private jet), Norton's successful but emotionally taxing performance (leading to a post-show breakdown), his weight loss, and his stage attire.  Anthony recounted a negative experience at their D.C. hotel, describing a dilapidated, mold-infested kitchen and subsequent move to a better hotel, contrasting it with Norton's luxurious Four Seasons stay.  Anthony also shared his girlfriend's emotional response to a *Lost* season finale.  The conversation flowed into a discussion of watching shows without commercials and then to *The Sopranos* finale, including listener speculation about multiple endings being filmed.  They also joked about Roger Clemens' injury and Joe Torre's nose-picking.  The segment ended with promotion of their "Traveling Virus" comedy shows and a ticket giveaway; Frank Vincent, a *Sopranos* actor, was mentioned as a scheduled guest.

Next, the hosts discussed one host's upcoming dental work, followed by commentary on the MTV Movie Awards, particularly Sarah Silverman's performance and MTV's surprisingly lax profanity standards.  This transitioned into a critical discussion of news coverage, specifically the media's prioritization of Paris Hilton's jail check-in over the deaths of 14 American soldiers in Iraq.  This sparked a lengthy debate on the Iraq War, the hosts' belief in a flawed military strategy, and their frustration with political constraints.  One host mentioned receiving supportive correspondence from soldiers.  The conversation returned to Paris Hilton, focusing on speculation about her jail experience, interspersed with humor. A two-time Iraq war veteran caller supported their criticism of the war.  A segment followed where the hosts' staff presented articles from women's magazines containing (in their opinion) absurd and humorous sex tips from a male perspective. Callers offered their opinions on the matter.

The show then featured an interview with Frank Vincent, who promoted his book, "Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man," and website.  They discussed *The Sopranos* finale, Vincent's character, and the challenges of keeping the ending secret.  Following the interview, the hosts discussed Chuck Liddell's UFC loss to Rampage Jackson, comparing UFC to boxing and noting UFC's increasing popularity.  A caller, Brett (an ex-Marine), supported the troops and offered suggestions for improving the war effort.  Another caller, Chrissy, described a positive experience at Norton's D.C. show, while Jason discussed UFC and boxing fighter pay.  Another caller unsuccessfully attempted to obtain extra show tickets.  The show then focused on a "girly magazine" article detailing "sexiest things to do after sex," which the hosts and callers overwhelmingly ridiculed as unrealistic and indicative of relationship problems, contrasting the magazine's suggestions with the natural post-coital desire for sleep. The segment concluded with awarding more Jones Beach show tickets to callers.

[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio out of any other medium have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio top jokes, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  I'm Broco, NBC Nightly News.  wardrobe?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What are you doing in death?  I've been hanging a lot with JFK.  He's the life of the party, let me tell you.  Why would he be the life of the party?  At the party, he's the one that goes around with the Doritos. 
[00:04:30]  And he fills his head with salsa.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Indeed.  What?  Enough of this palaver.  Ah.  Good morning. 
[00:05:00]  Enough of this palaver from you.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Welcome.  To the Opie and Anthony show.  Kicking off another week.  Kicking off.  Oh, my God.  Back and forth to D.C. since the last time we talked.  Yeah.  We took the choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  The choo-choo. 
[00:05:30]  Hi.  My fans were a little disillusioned with that.  Why?  Like, how'd you get here?  I don't know.  I think they got this image of us on a private jet or something.  You know?  And then I go, oh, I took the train.  Took the train?  And they look at you like, what?  You mean the choo-choo train?  The train?  And they got like a private train?  No.  Just the train.  It's the easiest way to get to D.C.  I mean.  Flying's pretty easy if you just have your carry-on.  Ah.  Yeah.  Really. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  But the train's three hours.  Yeah.  The flight's 45 minutes.  Yeah.  But by the time you get to the airport, go through security, wait a little bit, then you take  the flight.  And then the airport's a little further away, too.  Let me tell you something.  I bet you, I bet you, we both leave from here, I'll beat you to D.C. taking the choo-choo.  Hells no.  I'm talking to people that know how to do this.  People that commute from New York to Washington, D.C. every day by plane, they got it down.  They have their briefcase, and that's all they need. 
[00:06:30]  Actually, I got to take it back, because they do have the shuttle.  The shuttle is a lot different than regular, like, flying.  Yeah.  They got it really down, because they understand there's a lot of businessmen and women going  through, so they make it a lot quicker and easier.  But if there's weather, there's nothing you can do, and that's what's scary.  If it's raining or whenever it's windy, you're stuck.  With a train, you're not stuck.  Weather will stop.  Well, we went down to Washington, D.C. for a little Jimmy Norton's taping.  Oh, my God.  For his HBO big one-hour special. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Thank you guys for coming.  It was great.  Amazing.  It was great to be on the road and have nothing to do.  Yeah.  Usually, when we go away, there's interviews, there's radio shows, there's meet-and-greets,  there's sales meetings, there's this, there's that, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Our own comedy thing that we have to host or something like that.  This is just nothing.  Yeah.  No stress whatsoever.  We just went down there.  All the pressure was on Jimmy.  All we had to do was stand up, like, 45 minutes into the show, wave at everybody, sit back down,  and enjoy the rest of the comedy.  That was it. 
[00:07:30]  Enjoy the show.  Who's paying that bill?  I love it.  Yes.  I had to evacuate my hotel room.  Yeah.  Where do we begin?  First of all, we should begin by telling everyone, Jimmy just absolutely kicked ass down there  in D.C.  This is going to look so good on TV.  I hope so, man.  It's going to look amazing.  The crowd was great.  I hadn't seen any of your stuff.  You'd been working out now with this material for how long?  Six months.  About six months at all the clubs, and on purpose, I've avoided seeing Jimmy at any 
[00:08:00]  of these clubs, because I see you all the time anyway.  Yeah.  Don't blame me.  Four hours a day, five hours, three hours a day.  I love how Anthony says I purposely avoid Jimmy.  Yes, I avoided Jimmy in the club.  You avoid everybody.  Of course I do.  You're not that calculated.  But I had a reason.  You finally got to see Jimmy Norton.  You should just say that.  Yes.  Jimmy, wow.  You're funny.  I never knew.  I hadn't seen your act.  You made it sound so serious. 
[00:08:30]  I avoided seeing Jimmy.  I wanted to be pure when I saw him and his new material.  There were.  Because I didn't want to know any of the material ahead of time.  You're lying.  Crap.  I know.  But just seeing it, because it was all new to me.  And just hysterical.  I sit there jealous, looking, going, how did he come up with that?  Or write that?  Why don't you sit there and write jokes?  Well, space food I came up with when I heard you say it. 
[00:09:00]  I looked.  There's a line I do where I say space food, which was a direct cumulip.  And as I say it, I'm looking in the audience.  And I knew where the guys were sitting.  But I'm looking, trying to make eye contact with Anthony.  I couldn't be prouder.  That was very nice.  Actually, you know, it just was amazing.  You did such a great job.  You looked so loose and natural up there.  And you know what?  You're going to have to lose all of the material about your fat or anything. 
[00:09:30]  I see you cut back.  Your mushy body and all that.  Because you don't look mushy anymore.  For a heterosexual guy, if we could find one in this room, you looked great.  You looked like you were not only just, all right, he's lost some weight.  But you actually look in shape on stage.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, your shoulders were wider than your midsection.  So you had, like, you know, you had that V-shape going.  And, you know, you didn't look like a tub of crap out there.  It might have been the long black shirt he was wearing, though. 
[00:10:00]  I don't know.  Whatever it was wearing, the guy's been working out.  His arms looked good.  You looked great, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I got to say, my friend Angela at Joseph Abood Clothing, thank you.  She made the right choices for me.  She said, this is what you should wear.  Like, a black shirt and just jeans, which is all I wore.  I didn't know.  Everyone else, like, I heard Atel wore a blazer.  Like, or a leather, a suede jacket of some sort.  Might not have been a suit jacket.  They have to hose him down halfway during the year?  Yeah, but it was so hot in that theater.  I'm like, how would you wear a, and I know D.L. Hughley shot last night. 
[00:10:30]  He probably wore a blazer.  And I heard Saget wore a jacket.  I just, I couldn't wear it.  Wow, it was perfect.  Perfect.  Yep.  And I had, we had two shows, and the first one was good, but I wasn't happy with it.  I got a good show there, but it wasn't what I wanted.  And I was freaking out.  And I mean, I was, what happened was, when they see me on it.  Really?  Because I peeked in the dressing room after that first show, and I saw a scene that looked  like an apocalypse now. 
[00:11:00]  He was breaking the mirrors and cutting himself.  And it looked like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now in his room.  I had, I'd say, a five or ten minute freak.  I needed to get it out.  And Ope was the one who talked me down, of all the people that talked to me, because  I know you'd see me the most.  Well, I got it.  I mean, this is cool for the people that went to the shows down there in D.C.  The listeners, by the way, were just amazing for you, Jimmy.  They're always on, man.  And the material was right on.  And I was sitting in the audience, we were losing our minds.  We thought you were beyond on your game. 
[00:11:30]  I mean, we thought you had a perfect performance.  So then the first show ends, and everyone leaves the theater.  And everyone, right away, Jimmy's losing his mind in his dressing room.  He's freaking out.  And I'm like, where is he?  I was like, I'm not going to let my pal do this to himself.  He had a great set.  Because Ant and I were like, we were like, holy crap.  First of all, like, me and, how do we explain that?  Ant and I were looking at each other during the whole first show going, we would be fired 
[00:12:00]  for that.  Fired.  Fired for that.  Fired.  We were counting how many times we would be fired off the radio for what you were doing  on this stage.  And I'm sitting there like, this is so not fair.  Like, people have got to understand the whole radio thing that we're just trying to make  jokes and entertain people because you can still do it in a theater.  Yeah.  And these are all listeners to our radio show, hardcore listeners.  Ant and I kept looking, fired.  And we counted like 10 to 12 jokes that you did on that stage that would get a radio guy 
[00:12:30]  fired.  I got to say, when you finally do tune in and watch this HBO special, you're going to,  this is cutting edge for HBO.  You went where I have not seen comics go.  It was so goddamn funny.  Yeah.  And so, like, just screw the political correctness.  I'm going ahead with what's funny.  And it was hysterical and just, like, shocking and really, really funny. 
[00:13:00]  So the first show, you knocked it out of the park.  Absolutely.  And Ant and I were, like everyone else in the audience, just blown away.  And then the rumblings, oh, he's losing his mind in there.  Kenny's at your door.  He's like, you sure you want to go in there?  I'm like, get out of my way.  I wouldn't go in there if I were you.  Jimmy has a way of beating himself up.  I'm like, not tonight, Jimmy.  Not tonight.  Well, it was only because.  Because it's your big moment and our special on HBO.  And I've seen you a million times.  I've never seen you better on a stage. 
[00:13:30]  Well, I had a thing.  David told me, he goes, it's a hot theater.  It's an older theater.  Because I had fought real hard to shoot this in D.C.  I wanted to shoot it in D.C.  And the theater's the Lincoln Theater where Lewis shot his special.  It was really a warm.  It's an older theater.  Yeah.  And Dave said the earlier show for him was subdued because the people have been standing outside in 95-degree heat.  And then they come in and it's just, it's hot.  Heat is the enemy of comedy.  So it was a good show.  I watched some in the truck after you and I talked.  And I felt much better about it.  And it's a high ceiling.  Sometimes you don't hear on stage what you guys are hearing in the audience. 
[00:14:00]  Oh.  It's a very weird thing.  I've had different theaters.  I've had comedians warn me like, dude, and this one is high ceiling.  It's a little harder to hear.  So I watched in the truck after you and I talked.  I'm like, oh, yeah, it did look okay.  But you were the one that calmed me down because I was like, Opus seen me a million times.  And he's like, dude, what are you talking about?  And everyone was like high five and like, oh, my God, Jimmy just nailed it.  But the late show was, when I'm on stage in the late show, I'm like, this is what I wanted.  Like, it was not that the crowd was better. 
[00:14:30]  I just think they sat them a bit differently.  Because when they seat, the woman who does the seating, she did a great job with getting the audience in there.  But I wanted hardcores up front.  Like, I didn't want good looking people up front.  All right.  You are going to say it because I'm like, this is the problem Jimmy had.  Good looking people.  If you're in the first five rows of the second show down there in D.C., you are considered an Opie and Anthony slob.  I went ballistic because the first show, they tried to get all the beautiful people in the front row.  And that drove Jimmy nuts.  He's like, I don't do that type of thing. 
[00:15:00]  I want my fans in the first few rows.  That's what they do.  Well, they were – we had been warned beforehand.  And it's a typical – it's just television does that.  They want diversity.  And I'm like, I – and again, they were fine up front.  But they were nice people.  They were having fun.  But what I wanted on the late show, I didn't want nice people.  I didn't want diversity.  I wanted animals.  I wanted the animals that listened to the show.  I didn't care if they were black or white.  I didn't care what they were.  I wanted them fat.  And I wanted them Opie and Anthony fans. 
[00:15:30]  And they got – that's what they got for the late show.  They were just a bit more of the ones that were probably in the back for the first show up front where I wanted them for the late show.  And I felt better.  I'm like, that's the people I want, these messes.  I don't want good looking, beautiful, attractive people.  Well, that's not my fan base, man.  Yeah.  You know?  So the late show, I felt, is exactly what I wanted.  What were you thinking as you were leaving the stage after the second show?  I got what I wanted.  This is what –  You were happy.  And there was a couple of bits I forgot, but I did an hour and 19. 
[00:16:00]  I got to cut it down to like 56.  So it's like I did at least 20 minutes.  I don't even know what you're going to be – I don't know what you're going to cut out.  I know.  I know because it was so good.  Will that be on the DVD, the whole set?  No, there will be DVD extra and some of the signing we did in the alley, which is why I wanted you guys there.  Will be in the extras and also a lot of the sets I've been shooting, like bad jokes, things that are going to be in the extras.  I don't know what I'm going to cut yet to be honest with you.  A lot of people are asking when it's going to air.  October.  October, okay.  Yeah, so you got a lot of material and it's all just funny and just amazing to have that. 
[00:16:30]  There are comics that hope they could get seven minutes, like seven minutes of good stuff.  Yeah.  You want an hour and 19 minutes of stuff.  Your pop culture stuff was amazing.  Thanks, man.  I love doing that too.  It was fun.  It's like all –  Yeah, it was good.  I'm afraid it's not going to be topical by October, but there was nothing specifically happening today I mentioned.  Right, right.  So I'm like, yeah, people will still be topical.  Well, no, I mean you hit on some massive stories that will still – people will want to hear your take on.  So the D.C. trip was a success.  Anthony had to move hotels. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, I had to move hotels.  I was enraged.  Yeah.  Enraged.  Well, we stayed at this hotel and we've been staying there every time we go to D.C.  And you know how I've been against going to D.C. for so long?  I realized what it was.  The hotel.  It's that goddamn awful hotel they put us at every single time.  And it was recommended by Ben years ago.  And I could see why.  Jesus Christ.  The only thing I could see is that it had a 10-foot mirror in the place. 
[00:17:30]  Maybe that was it.  Because we walk into the room and there's a door in our room.  Well, you got to explain.  It's one of these hotels that try to be uber hip.  Uber hip and trendy.  It's almost like – it's like you don't feel like you're in a hotel room.  You're like crashing at a friend's pad.  You got like CDs you can like play.  Yeah.  CDs in the room.  Great.  Big, huge, oversized mirror, man.  Yeah, big mirror.  And there's like pictures on the walls. 
[00:18:00]  Red furniture, man.  Yeah.  Oh, whoopity-doo.  Evita products everywhere.  I want a hotel that has room service.  A big body huggy pillow thing.  Yeah.  I don't want that.  I want a hotel with room service and a nice room.  This thing.  How about a neighborhood that you can walk around in?  Yeah, that you can walk around in that has some stuff in it. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  Like if you need something, you can go down to the store.  This place was in the middle of nothingness.  I like to walk around outside the hotel.  There's – well, there's –  There was one restaurant that we could go to.  Yeah.  And thank God because there's no room service in this stupid hotel.  Yeah.  There's no room service.  Oh, yeah.  There's like barely a pamphlet with like potato chips on it.  Well, I ordered –  I ordered coffee and fruit just a quick little bite before Jimmy shows and – because I – I didn't even know you left the hotel until like I saw you Saturday or something.  I don't know. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  People think we hang out all the time.  We barely know each other at this point.  I fled the hotel.  And they brought up the coffee.  It was the same coffee you could make in your room.  In the room.  It was disgusting.  And it was a fruit plate that was three or four days old.  I called up.  I'm like, you're kidding, right?  You're serving this to people?  Oh, the fruit plates I got.  But that was –  New place that we –  Oh, wonderful.  That's easy compared to what happened to you.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  We walk into the room, me and my girl and Keith, who is, you know, our chaperone. 
[00:19:30]  It's like the dating game.  And there's a door that's kind of opened a little bit in our room.  We open this door up and it's this hidden kitchen.  There's a kitchen in the room that has rat traps on the floor, a good – I'll be honest.  I'm not going to exaggerate.  About a quarter inch of dust on the floor, big dusty, like, tumbleweeds.  And everything in this little kitchen room is covered with this dust, like brown crap dripping from the walls. 
[00:20:00]  And open up the refrigerator and there was this V8 in there that God knows when it was in there from.  And a stove that's just sitting there full of dust that I guess work people use.  But it's not supposed to be part of the hotel room, but this door was open.  The door was open.  I have no idea why it was there, who uses that room.  But it's a door in the hotel room that you open up and it's this kitchen.  Yeah, this nasty kitchen. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, I hear it used to be like an apartment complex.  Yeah, it was probably some bad apartment, crack apartment or something.  Yeah.  Crack house.  And then by the air conditioner and heater on the wall, where it was blowing up, the wallpaper was peeling.  So we kind of look underneath where the wallpaper is peeling and all it's packed with black mold.  Nice.  Just mold all over the place.  The ceiling was cracking and the place smelled like they had been trying to deodorize something, perhaps a dead body. 
[00:21:00]  Or dead rats.  Dead rats behind the walls, probably.  So I was like, no, I'm not staying here.  I go, where's Jimmy staying?  Oh, the Four Seasons.  HBO, man.  I know.  Which is like the cream of the crop of hotels is Four Seasons.  Let's see.  We didn't rate this weekend.  He was on stage for an hour for HBO.  I know.  Our part was standing up.  I got to remind people again.  We stood up for about five seconds.  That was our whole part.  So we weren't worthy of the Four Seasons. 
[00:21:30]  I stayed in some crap hotels.  Your part, excuse my interruption, your part was getting 2,500 people into that theater  in a faster response than anybody else had.  And you certainly did that.  So you certainly merited any hotel.  The fans were great.  They were.  And they were all Opie and Anthony fans.  Enthusiastic.  Yeah.  But I've stayed in crappy hotels.  I don't care.  As long as it's got TV and room service, I'm fine.  But this was so completely bad.  And I never liked that hotel in the first place.  There's nothing to do. 
[00:22:00]  Nowhere to go.  The bar doesn't open till late.  So why the hell do I want to be there?  But in a case like this, we're only staying a couple of days.  I'm fine.  I'd be fine with it.  If it wasn't, you know, black mold and a kitchen that I don't know what the hell they're doing  in there and the place smelling like death.  So I, you know, got Keith on it and he got in touch with Kenny and Mike and they all kind  of worked something out and I got to stay at a wonderful hotel. 
[00:22:30]  The Mandarin.  Nice.  There you go.  Oh, was that place nice.  Oh, giant marble lobby, 24-hour room service with gourmet food, nice bar downstairs, open  till all hours.  It's great.  We got to stop.  A suite.  We got to stop waiting for the companies that we work for to actually take care of us.  And we got to do it ourselves.  That place.  We really do, man.  That place.  I will never stay there again.  No, I'm done with that place too.  Done. 
[00:23:00]  Done.  Done ski.  Four seasons or nothing, I say.  That's it.  But I had a problem with room service too.  I called up and when you call in the four seasons room service, if you say, let's see  you call at five after eight and they go about 30 minutes and I'll be 835, Mr. Norton.  And 837, my food comes.  Wow.  Oh, the man wheeled it in.  Oh, I was very disappointed.  Chased him out.  Flat screen TV.  Boy, that place ruled.  All right.  Yeah, we got to take a break. 
[00:23:30]  We'll continue.  But yeah, we did a quick trip to D.C. for Jimmy.  And it was great.  Yeah.  Absolutely great.  More stories from our D.C. trip.  Got to get into the Paris Hilton thing, the MTV Movie Awards.  What else is going on?  The Lindsay knife pictures from a year ago.  Well, we'll explain everything next.  Oh, Lohan.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought you had a problem with your relationship.  No, no, no.  Lindsay knife pictures.  Just saying that casually.  I got a good Lindsay story, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll tell that next. 
[00:24:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Phone number 877-212-5762.  Write it down.  877-212-5762.  So we got back from D.C. yesterday.  I heard some screaming on the train.  What was that about? 
[00:24:30]  Well, there was a little weeping going on.  My girlfriend was crying on the train.  She was crying.  And I was looking around like people thinking I'm beating her or something.  Was she crying because she couldn't get breakfast like we were crying?  No.  Couldn't get breakfast?  Stupid Excella.  Yeah.  We take, what, a 10 o'clock train?  Really fast.  Take a 10 o'clock train.  Isn't that like primetime breakfast?  Yeah.  And they're serving like weird lunch crap. 
[00:25:00]  I just had some luncheon meat.  Yeah, Italian luncheon meat at 10 o'clock in the morning with cheese.  You weren't getting breakfast.  And I look at the guy like, do you have a bagel, yogurt?  And he looks at me like I'm crazy.  Yeah.  Well, I am.  But I mean, you know, I was just asking for breakfast at that moment in time.  What do you think it is?  An airplane?  They had like a, whatever.  They had a pasta dish. 
[00:25:30]  It's 10 o'clock in the morning.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Give me some eggs.  Give me a bagel.  They have one thing.  They hand out their menu like it's a big thing.  Right, right, right.  Whatever.  You're on a train.  So anyway, I'm sorry.  So I heard some screaming.  I want to know what that was about.  Well, it was screaming.  It was, you know, just some weeping.  A little weeping.  Well, thanks to Than, I had gotten hooked on Lost.  Now, I didn't mention this because I just said I've been watching DVDs.  I've been doing a marathon. 
[00:26:00]  If you noticed over the past couple of weeks, I've been talking about, you know, I've been  doing a marathon of a TV show.  I never mentioned Lost because I know our stupid listeners would have just done nothing  but pop spoilers up in front of me.  So, but it was Lost.  And the season finale of season three, the final season so far.  You got to explain, by the way, you weren't into Lost whatsoever.  Out of nowhere, you decided.  No.  Than gave me season one.  And you got hooked.  And I watched it.  The pilot episode was great.  And then, you know, you just got hooked.  I was completely hooked watching upwards of like 10 episodes a night. 
[00:26:30]  I get home and me and my girlfriend would do nothing but watch until it felt like I was  arc welding without one with the goggles on.  Like I just felt like.  Yeah.  They time out to like 43 minutes without the commercials, which is great.  Who the hell?  And as I'm watching Lost on DVD, I'm saying who the hell could watch this once a week with  commercials?  Because the show will end and it'll be like, and you'll see Lost and go up next, next one, 
[00:27:00]  next one.  I'm not going to sit there and wait a week to find out what happens and then have to  sit through commercials to find out what happens.  You know, it's so good.  The screen goes black for like a second and then it comes back and you're back with the  show.  43 minutes for an hour show.  So I've been watching those, the DVDs.  Season three came out and I didn't want to not see that until the box set comes out,  which I think is going to be in December or something.  It's pushed off until December. 
[00:27:30]  So amazing.  I love this.  iTunes.  Goddamn iTunes.  You just go there and download the entire season on iTunes.  And I watched it on the train, watched it at home and finally got through the season  finale, which was a two hour season finale yesterday on the train ride home.  And one of the characters.  Oh, no.  Well, I'll just say one of the characters.  I'm not going to blow it for you.  I won't blow it for you, Jimmy.  But one of the characters dies.  But believe me, there's characters dying. 
[00:28:00]  This show isn't shy about killing people.  So one of the characters dies that, you know, my girlfriend liked as a character and everything.  And she's just like, oh, my God.  I heard a, oh, no.  She's like, oh, no.  And there she is, like, tears coming out of her eyes.  And I'm looking around like, hey, people are going to think I'm hitting you.  Could you not?  It's like, hey, oh, boy.  Oh, this movie we're watching.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, put my hands up.  Look, my knuckles aren't bruised.  Never touched her.  But, yeah, she was pretty bummed about that.  And I'm just, now I don't know what to do.  Got to wait until season four, which is in, what, January or February or something.  And then I'm going to have to sit through commercials.  You're going to have to sit through commercials.  DVR it and have people ruin it for me?  I don't know.  You're in a tough position now.  I caught up on three seasons in record time. 
[00:29:00]  How long was that, then?  It was, like, a few weeks.  I was just sitting there with my eyes burning in the morning.  Feels like someone threw sand in my eyes.  You know, they're going to have to figure crap out as far as commercials go.  Mm-hmm.  Because we're getting used to watching our stuff without commercials.  DVRing it is one way.  DVR, they're kind of figuring out something to do.  I know there's this one for weight loss.  And they run through these skinny, fat people examples at, like, 1,000 miles an hour.  And there's certain things that you might want to see on these skinny, fat things.  And they go, if you're – and if you're DVRing this, just slow it down and stop on whatever you want to see. 
[00:29:30]  So it kind of entices people – entices people to stop on the commercial and watch it if you're into that.  Where they'll have to make commercials more interesting and funnier and a little better.  Yeah.  And people will stay with them.  Yeah.  And now they've got a challenge ahead of them.  How do you get us to watch your commercials?  The DVDs are great.  And that iTunes thing where you can download episodes – 
[00:30:00]  It's ridiculous.  I loved it.  I watched it on my computer on there.  It's a nice widescreen, so it comes up widescreen.  It was great.  Yeah.  You could just write when you need it.  And they automatically – right when an episode is finished, it automatically downloads onto my Mac.  And there it was.  So you're not missing an episode.  You're not behind.  You're not delayed.  What do you mean after it's finished?  After the episode finishes on TV.  Oh, okay.  It automatically downloads onto your computer.  Oh, that's pretty cool. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  I didn't know they had that little feature.  I turned my computer on.  It says, you know, episode is downloading.  Hey, speaking of TV shows, you know, we've got to get into it.  The Sopranos last night.  Right.  Finally, some action.  Big action.  Wow.  I mean, all the papers saying it's the best episode yet.  One of them, yeah.  It was amazing.  One of the best episodes ever for The Sopranos.  Speaking of DVRs, I bet a lot of people are clicking off this show right now.  But sorry.  You know what, though?  It's in the paper.  It's everywhere.  I mean, you're not going to be able to avoid it today. 
[00:31:00]  That's why I am so glad I was able to avoid Lost spoilers and almost blew it during the  last goddamn episode on the friggin' train.  That stupid conductor comes by and we're watching the final episode.  I hated that guy, by the way.  And he goes, oh, what you watching, Lost?  Like, yeah.  He goes, oh, all my friends are watching that.  What they're saying is that they're on a spaceship or something.  They're all aliens. 
[00:31:30]  I heard that.  And I didn't know.  You know something?  This show could go anywhere.  So I have no clue or anything like that.  And I turn and I go, you stupid idiot.  I go, you are an ass.  I go, you see we're watching the last episode here.  Why would you tell me anything about it?  Yeah, shut up and just serve us our deli meats at 10 in the morning.  I go, you know how I hope it ends?  I said, I hope it ends with a conductor being thrown off a train.  He did say that.  Dude, I was egging him on.  You guys couldn't hear me egging him.  Oh, and then Jimmy's egging him on. 
[00:32:00]  I'm like, yeah, but they were just trying to find out about, like, what do you think happened?  And I was just trying to get him to keep talking like he was being funny and interesting.  I said, I hope it ends like the Indiana Jones in the hot air balloon, the dirigible scene.  No ticket.  Just throw him off the train.  Like, why the hell would you do that?  It's like, oh, laws?  Well, let me tell you what everyone's saying about it.  You jack off.  I'm trying to watch the damn thing.  And then Anthony goes, well, maybe I could just turn it off and not watch this.  I could watch the conductor. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, I could just watch the conductor.  I was so pissed at this idiot.  Yeah, no one liked him.  It's like, it's Jimmy's egging him on.  Yeah, what?  So what happened?  No, I wanted to know what happened because they're watching.  I was like, shut up, Jimmy.  I'm trying to get him to talk.  What an ass.  Instead of talking about laws, why don't you go back there and find us all bagels?  Yeah, find something that's morning food.  You kook.  Morning food, lunatic.  He's a lunatic.  I think that a cellar affects your brain.  Oh, and he was so happy to be able to tell everyone that there was no breakfast food and  there was just Italian deli meats for everybody. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, see, Everett Koop.  Oh, he was so happy.  So happy.  That conductor was one of those guys.  Six cents?  You know, he's dead.  Oh, hey, thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks for nothing.  So the Sopranos, finally a lot of action.  Yeah.  And we got what?  One episode left.  And I got to say, there's one part, again, if you haven't seen it or you don't want to  know, turn the radio off for a minute.  But there's this, Bobby Bacala, which again, it's in the post.  Buckman, of course, shows a picture and it goes, bye-bye, Bacala. 
[00:33:30]  So it's a good spoiler.  Yeah.  Jerk off.  Yep.  He gets shot while he's buying trains.  Aw.  Buying little choo-choo trains.  Aw, his little fat hands.  He's holding a train.  And it was such a well shot.  Good scene.  Yeah.  And one part of the thing, this is what annoys me about Buckman, there's one part  of it where Dr. Melfi, like, enough with her.  Oh.  She tells Tony she doesn't want to treat him anymore.  And this jackass, Adam Buckman, who I just think stinks, he goes, but just, he goes, the 
[00:34:00]  loss of two of the show's most popular characters was shocking enough.  But just as stunning and possibly more significant was Dr. Melfi's decision to cease treating  Tony.  Oh.  That wasn't stunning.  No.  No one cares.  It got to the point where no one cared about Tony going in to see Melfi anymore.  At the beginning of the show, it was relevant.  It was kind of interesting.  It was part of his mental illness thing.  But that kind of thing went away.  It was more about the crime family. 
[00:34:30]  Like, the first season of The Sopranos, if you watch, it was, and I remember the posters  that were out for the show, it was, if one family doesn't kill him, the other will.  That was like their catchphrase, because it was a lot of his mob family and then his own  family, and him dealing with both of them.  And it kind of, him going to the shrink was part of it, but then it kind of got to the  point where people were interested in the mob aspect of it. 
[00:35:00]  They wanted more mob action than they did him dealing with his personal family life  and the shrink.  So, Melfi was irrelevant, you know, seasons ago.  Who cared?  It got to the point where they would.  All of a sudden, the scene would change from some, you know, cool action scene or suspense,  and he's sitting in Melfi's office, and you could hear the collective, ah!  Or a little of this.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring. 
[00:35:30]  Were the other Homer clip my favorite?  No!  No?  No.  Oh, I don't know how that, Ant's got that.  But boring.  She just, and she stinks.  She stinks.  It just, who cared at that point?  Enough.  So how do you think The Sopranos is going to end?  It sucks.  There it is.  How do you think it ends next week?  I think they're going to have a complete surprise.  What happened was, uh, Phil Leotardo, uh, played by the great Frank Vincent, who I heard 
[00:36:00]  is calling in today.  Yes.  He's calling in at, uh, 8 o'clock.  Our, our buddy Frank Vincent.  Declared war on The Sopranos?  Yep.  And, uh, wants, wants him gone.  Declared war to get rid of him because he's a hardcore new guy.  He's not like the old stupid John who died of cancer.  No.  He's angry.  He was in prison for a lot of time.  This guy just wants control everything.  Wants it done.  Wants Tony done.  So they shot Silvio.  Silvio, uh, got capped.  He's in a coma.  Bobby Bacala's dead.  With a little train in his hand.  Oh, little fat hands.  Where's his little choo-choo?  With his fat hands. 
[00:36:30]  He just wanted to buy a choo-choo.  And he, he's commenting on the train like, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go for it.  And then he falls into the, knocks the display apart.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Well, what happened is Tony's people tried to, Tony's people tried to kill Frank Vincent  first.  Yeah.  They heard the, the hit was on and, uh, and they shot the wrong person.  They shot his gomar.  Ah, gomar.  And her father.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, it was really good, man.  So the war is on, yeah.  And Tony's holed up now with a gun.  I think what's gonna happen is, uh, he's going to call for an escort. 
[00:37:00]  And it's gonna be, uh, a male.  And he's gonna be surprised and intrigued.  And that's gonna have the scene.  You're gonna see, like, the escort sitting there and just the top of Tony's head moving.  And you're gonna hear the escort going, I knew you'd like it, Daddy.  And that's just gonna be the end.  The end.  And that's gonna happen.  That's my idea of the end.  And then they play It's Raining Men as the credits roll.  Something completely unexpected.  No, no resolution.  How great would that be?  No resolution. 
[00:37:30]  No resolution, nothing.  Just a homosexual experience from the crime boss.  And AJ's talking, and, like, all of a sudden, like, Black Ghetto slang.  Like, yo, what's up, Matt?  And without any explanation, uh, metal becomes, like, uh, some type of a stripper.  And she's 40.  That's what happens when she's 40.  You think this is gonna be a resolution?  You think they're gonna leave us hanging?  They can't leave it hanging.  They can't leave it hanging.  Unless they want to make a movie.  Yeah.  If they want to make a movie, then Tony can't, uh, be killed.  Uh, I say either two things happen. 
[00:38:00]  Tony gets whacked out, or he turns states.  I'm gonna go with, uh, something that might be pretty obvious.  I'm gonna say, uh, AJ kills, uh, Tony.  That's a little too, uh, that's hokey.  Yeah, I understand.  That's a little hokey.  He thinks he's well-protected, and the Safeway House, and all that.  And all of a sudden, someone that he trusted kills him.  Yeah.  I'm gonna go with AJ.  I say Paulie Walnuts.  Yeah, it could be Paulie. 
[00:38:30]  He was dealing with the Brooklyn family at one point.  Yeah, yeah.  He was dealing with them, doing some stuff, uh, not, not, nothing against Tony and those guys.  But he was doing something behind the, uh, behind the, uh, thing.  And, uh, when word got out that he, that, uh, Phil Leotardo was gonna be whacked, all  of a sudden, he turned up nowhere.  So maybe it was, uh, Paulie Walnuts who warned him.  That's just my take on it.  You know he's gonna sing, because it's called The Sopranos.  That's what's gonna happen.  They're all just gonna sing.  The end.  By the way, uh, I know we're talking about The Sopranos. 
[00:39:00]  How funny is it that Roger Clemens is hurt?  Where's my Susan Wolvenk?  Oh, Roger Clemens is, uh, injured.  He hasn't played one goddamn game with the Yankees, and he's injured.  He was playing with, I think he had a warm-up with the Toledo, uh, maple trees.  Maple trees.  That was his latest, uh, you know, warm-up to get back on the, on the Yankees.  And now what, he's out for two weeks? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  He's out for two weeks.  He's injured.  How great is this?  They're gonna do, uh, all kinds of, uh, you know, MRIs on his groin area.  Apparently, he, uh, hurt his groin.  A tired groin, they call it.  A tired groin.  I'm sleepy.  He's an older guy.  His sack is probably getting, getting in the way as he's trying to, you know.  Oh, when he pitches, it spins around like five times.  Unravels.  Gotta tape that bad boy down.  Tape it down.  You get, like, uh, he's bandaged it to your leg or something. 
[00:40:00]  I'm just talking about, you know, the, uh...  Yeah, a little gravity.  Yeah, there you go.  A little Turkish, uh...  Like warm Turkish taffy.  Right.  I was happy to see them win last night, too.  I was rooting against them.  An A-bomb!  Mm, from A-Rod!  But my girlfriend's not a baseball fan, but I'm like, I kinda hope that A-Rod beats him  in the home run, just cause he's been getting killed in the media.  Yeah, yeah.  As much as I don't like A-Rod, and he's a dirty mariner until the day he dies, as far as  I'm concerned.  But, you know, the scum, you know, the post, those just filthy eggs are just, you know... 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, he pulled it out.  Yeah.  But there you go.  Clemens is injured for two weeks.  Very injured.  And I couldn't be happier, being a Mets fan.  He's getting an MRI!  It's gonna be great!  Our people are disappointed!  Roger Clemens has a tired groin!  A tired groin!  This is unbelievable!  George Steinbrenner's examining his tired groin in his box!  Tired groin! 
[00:41:00]  The excitement on the bench!  Oh, no, Georgie Posada is getting Bengay!  He's gonna massage the area!  Roger Clemens is in George's box, and Roger Clemens is coming back!  Oh, my goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things...  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, Roger Clemens standing right in...  Ever.  Yeah, ever. 
[00:41:30]  He's just standing in a friggin' box.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, this doesn't weigh in the top 350s.  It's a guy in a box waving at people.  Waving.  Oh, my goodness gracious!  He's acting like Hitler turned up in Rockaway.  What's the matter with you, stupid?  Yeah, it's not too dramatic.  He might be able to squeak out 10 wins for the Yankees this year if he's lucky.  If he fixes his tired groin! 
[00:42:00]  Tired groin!  If all of a sudden, like, Clemens jog out of the dugout in uniform and pitched...  And pitched.  That would be amazing.  That's for me.  I'd be like, wow, who saw this coming?  I would even have to applaud that one.  Oh, my God!  Who's taking him out?  It's Roger Clemens!  Roger Clemens is at the ballpark!  But his...  That's pretty much what it was.  He's watching the game!  Oh, my God!  Roger Clemens, who turned the Yankees down to go to the Astros for less money, is back! 
[00:42:30]  Shut up.  Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box.  With a tired line!  Now he is back!  Roger Clemens is at New York Yankee.  And there we go, John.  You don't have to worry about who's going to take that spot in the rotation.  Spot, spot!  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Big grin on Jorge Posada's day.  A big grin.  That's what's going on!  How great is this, Clemens? 
[00:43:00]  It gets funnier every time I hear it, because you know it's coming.  Here comes the excitement in the dugout.  A grin.  She's talking about it like it's the final scene of Do the Right Thing.  Yeah.  And it's stupid Posada grinning and Pettit knew.  Pettit knew!  Now the sign's in the stands!  So if Pettit knew, don't you think he might have told a few of the boys?  Yeah, I think so.  Let's be honest here.  Big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew. 
[00:43:30]  Joe Torre is picking his nose again!  Now a Yankee.  Attention fans, he is here.  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place in the rotation.  In the rotation!  Joe Torre has picked his nose so much, he now has to use his thumb.  His thumb.  He's got to just shove his thumb up there.  To just clog.  Pulled out a plug.  I love the fact that Torre can't get his fingers out of his big fat nose.  Good boy, Joe.  When he goes out to the mound to replace the pitcher, he takes the ball from him and shoves it up his nose.  Joe Torre shoving a baseball up his nose! 
[00:44:00]  It's crazy!  He's handing Joe Torre a Kleenex!  He's got to use a whole box!  Well, we've been watching the Clemens situation very closely.  Now he's out for two weeks.  This has just been the most amazing move in Yankee history.  Amazing!  He's injured and hasn't pitched a game for the Yankees!  When did he come back?  It's been over a month at this point, right?  It's got to be a month! 
[00:44:30]  A month he still hasn't pitched one ball for the Yankees.  Well, he's pitched a ball!  Apparently, it was his tired groin!  He's pitched it down to his kneecap!  He's pitched a lot of pitches, but for teams like the Nashville...  The Nashville Banjos?  There you go!  He's kind of keeping in line with the country music.  The Nashville Hen Vaggis. 
[00:45:00]  Let's go to Pat in Brooklyn.  Let's go to Pat in Brooklyn!  Oh my god, a call from Pat!  This could be the most exciting thing ever, Pat!  What's up, Pat?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, with the Soprano thing, they're actually airing...  Well, they're actually taped three final episodes, and no one knows.  Not even the cast members know what they're doing.  Oh, somebody knows, because they were in that final scene.  Well, Frank Vincent was supposed to be on the air with us last week, but he was filming for the Sopranos. 
[00:45:30]  So they could film three endings and not tell anybody what the endings are.  Well, they literally were still filming stuff up until the end.  That's a big risk, because what if James Gandolfini got killed in a car accident or something like that?  I mean, that's really a big...  A big risk.  I think that would be a little more serious than...  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't think they care about the...  Well, yeah, they would.  Sure they would.  I mean, that would be a big ratings grabber.  Yes.  The star is dead.  Then they'd have to fit him in like they did the mother. 
[00:46:00]  Remember when they superimposed her face?  Oh, God, was that creepy.  Yeah.  She was the greatest character ever on that show.  Ah, go.  Yeah, crap in your head.  There you go.  Can't say it.  Nice language for your mother.  It was just awful.  Let's take a break.  Hey, we're going to give away some tickets this week to the Traveling Virus comedy show,  June 16th at Jones Beach.  The next date, the next stop on the tour.  Eight or nine comedians.  There's a special running right now, right?  Is the special still running or...  Yep. 
[00:46:30]  Dan's eating.  Yes, the special is.  Oh, my God, there's a special!  Well, people are looking forward to the show June 16th at Jones Beach through Ticketmaster  and the special is...  Four mezzanine tickets for $69.  That is a deal, my friends.  And go to Virus Tour on MySpace for all the info, the lineups, and all the fun that's going  to be had this summer as we tour the country doing our comedy show.  Yes.  All right.  Yeah, why not? 
[00:47:00]  Why don't we give a couple tickets away right now?  A pair of tickets to the Traveling Virus show June 16th at Jones Beach.  You can get them through Ticketmaster.com.  But we'll give a pair away to a random caller right now.  877-212-5762.  Make sure you can get to Jones Beach June 16th because we're being heard all over the country.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I hope he's playing the microphone. 
[00:47:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, everybody?  We're a bit woozy today.  We had our big back and forth trip to D.C. since the last time we did the radio show.  And then it's like a crappy day in New York City today.  What is it?  Hurricane, tropical depression.  It had some kind of a fruity name.  Bobby or something.  It had a fruity name.  Barry. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, Barry.  Barry.  Hurricane, or it was Tropical Storm Barry, and now it's just depressed.  I'm a little depressed.  Does he want to have a financial meeting before he leaves town?  Yeah.  They're going to drop some Welbutrin into him so he's not so depressed.  We know it, Barry.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, gee.  Friends with Super Agent Bob Eatman.  They can just imagine.  Yes.  Wow.  Nothing but excitement. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, wow.  Does Bob have friends or just undertakers who hang out with him waiting?  Undertakers.  Like old-time ones with top hats.  Go around with a little measuring stick.  They measure you all the time for the coffin.  Barry's part of the organization to make sure we have some cash.  Yeah, leftover after this mess.  When we finally blow this whole thing up for good.  We'll at least be able to live.  He's a finance guy, so I don't have to go back to tin knocking.  He talks in languages that I... 
[00:49:00]  Sounds good.  Nothing beats when he breaks out those pie charts.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I love the pie charts.  Here's your financial allocations.  Here's a...  I believe we could put a little more into this, and I think we could be a little more aggressive  as far as...  Yeah, whatever.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  Yeah, whatever.  What?  Where do I sign?  That's the worst thing you could do, too.  I know.  Where do I sign? 
[00:49:30]  This is what these guys do.  They bore you to death, and you're like, all right, just give me the paperwork.  Where do I sign?  I got things to do.  You got to snort some crystal meth before they come over just so you can stay awake, and  then just go through it and try to deal with it, or else you'll end up like any number  of celebrities that ended up broke.  Hammer.  You'll end up like MC Hammer.  Well, a lot of people in entertainment, they give someone power of attorney so they don't  have to sit through these boring meetings, and then if the guy's not trustworthy... 
[00:50:00]  On the up and up.  Oh, are you screwed in the head?  You're screwed.  All right.  Speaking of DC really fast, so Saturday before Jim Norton's taping, HBO taping, we decided  to walk around Georgetown.  It was like, what, 95 degrees?  Mm-hmm.  Do a little shopping and get a bite to eat, and we're in desperate need of very cold water.  So we walk into this place, and it's Georgetown.  Georgetown's a really, really nice area.  And just to get water, it was like a pizza place, and they were making, I don't know, 
[00:50:30]  something on the grill.  Just a basic place, okay?  Um, and Lindsay goes to the bathroom, and she comes out with this look on her face like  she either saw a ghost or a pedophile.  A ghostly pedophile.  Something.  Something happened.  I'm like, what?  What?  You all right?  I thought somebody was exposing her in the back room.  Something crazy was going on with the look she gave me.  And she goes, cockroaches, cockroaches, cockroaches, cockroaches.  She could barely, like, speak.  And I'm like, cool. 
[00:51:00]  I gotta go check this out.  So I go into the ladies' room where she just came out of, right?  And I go in the room, the ladies' room, and the light's on, and I go in there.  Not a cockroach to be seen.  Well, they scurry.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  So I go back out.  I'm like, you're crazy.  I didn't see anything.  And I could tell by the look on her face.  She obviously saw cockroaches.  Turn out the light.  She goes, I went into the ladies' room, and I turned the light on, and there were hundreds. 
[00:51:30]  Wow.  Not a few.  Hundreds.  I just got the jeezes.  Of all sizes on every surface in the bathroom.  And she completely freaked out because she doesn't know if they're dropping on her from the ceiling or what have you.  And left.  Left the light on.  So by the time I got there, they were all gone again.  How crazy is that?  Where do they hide in the wall?  Well, did you see them?  I saw one very, very small, like, baby cockroach. 
[00:52:00]  Aw.  One.  But she saw hundreds.  And by the time I went into the bathroom, they were all gone because she turned the light on.  How creepy is that?  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  Bugs got your tongue?  Yeah.  Oh, cockroaches creep me out.  What do they do?  They're just creeps.  They just kind of walk around on the wall in the dark in the toilet?  They wait.  And when there's a little splash from somebody, they go up to one of the little droplets and go...  You turn the lights off and they just know it's time to shuffle. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  It's dinner time in the old commode.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Crawl up on the rim.  They're all fighting for the underside of the toilet.  Oh, that's like, yeah.  Oh, that's like the best restaurant ever.  Yeah.  They got to call in for reservations.  Can I get the underside of the seat, please?  Oh, we're all booked up, sir.  And then the light goes on and they shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle back into hiding.  Scurry.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Scurry away.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  They are just disgusting. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, but I wanted to check it out and unfortunately they were gone by the time I got in there.  That's why I'm so glad to be out of an apartment.  And I know you guys live in apartment buildings here in New York.  Jimmy, you ever seen one in yours?  Yeah, Jimmy's ever seen one in his building.  See, because they bring in exterminators on a monthly basis or something to make sure everything's taken care of.  Some of these buildings, though, it doesn't matter.  They're like celebrities that talk about how they move into these places and it's just a beautiful place.  And then there's cockroaches everywhere. 
[00:53:30]  And black mold and all sorts of stuff going on.  The basement in the place I'm finally leaving, veterans.  Veterans that go into basements in New York City.  So, you know, you get your oil man and all those guys that have to go down in the basement, right?  I ran into one of them.  This was a while back.  He goes, he's never seen a basement worse than the one in my building.  And he works in Manhattan.  He's a veteran.  Right.  He's like, that's probably one of the worst basements I've ever seen.  He said he saw all sorts of stuff scurrying around down there. 
[00:54:00]  How you are still in there in any way, shape, or form.  Hey, man.  It boggles my mind.  It boggles my mind.  We're away half the time.  Yeah, but half the time you're not.  It's coming to an end, thank God.  I should have a new joint within a week.  Within a week, finally.  You got to pull a Dr. Boom on that place.  What was that name?  His name?  Remember Dr. Boom?  He blew up the department building.  Yeah, he was nicknamed Dr. Boom.  Dr. Boom.  You should have filmed all the damage and just sued him. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Just do the guys renting me and sued me.  Sue everyone.  Anyway, hey, MTV Movie Awards.  Sarah Silverman did a good job last night, huh?  Did she?  She did a good job.  And I don't know what's up with MTV, but I applaud them.  No, you don't.  They made sure that there was a lot of cursing and stuff because the show was live.  Really?  I think they strategically did that to get people talking today.  Cursing like...  Well, last year, I don't think it was live, and by the time everyone saw it, they already 
[00:55:00]  knew all the highlights.  Yep.  Because that's the...  Ruining their award shows.  Well, that's the age we live in now.  You can't tape stuff.  They're too afraid that somebody's going to say something, it's going to be offensive,  and they're going to get some kind of a problem.  But if you tape something and someone says anything outrageous, it hits the internet immediately.  So by the time you actually see the movie awards, there's no surprises, and you're  like, why am I watching this crap?  Everyone knows who won because they print those.  And then there's no surprises.  So MTV went live last night, and Sarah Silverman did a very good job hosting, and everybody 
[00:55:30]  was cursing.  What kind of curses?  Everything.  Did the S get dropped?  All of them.  F?  Yes.  And they left it alone.  See, that's interesting.  Well, I mean, they were bleeping and this and that.  Oh, were they?  Yeah, yeah.  But it was very edgy.  Very edgy for MTV.  You know, technically, MTV could get away with that.  But it's the sponsors, you know, that they have a problem with.  That's why they don't put curses on.  But, you know, FX is the same thing.  It's a cable station. 
[00:56:00]  And when they play Rescue Me, they say all kinds of things.  Yeah.  You know, they drop the S-bomb, and then they talk about man-on-man action.  And a lot of sex talk.  Very gritty.  And that's not a service like HBO.  The rules are ridiculous.  Because, first of all, who doesn't have cable?  Yeah.  Even the unfortunates have cable.  That's the first thing they make sure they have.  Yeah, cable.  They'll get cable before they get food. 
[00:56:30]  You can get basic cable.  So we all have cable.  So you're sitting there in your living room.  To you, it's all the same.  But, oh, no, it's not.  Because this comes in for cable, and this you could actually get without cable, and that's the difference.  Mm-hmm.  I heard the T-word on, and the only reason I'm saying the T-word, because I don't know if we're allowed to say it here.  No, I don't think we are.  I don't feel like getting dumped out.  We're not.  They said the T-word on MTV last night for, you know, press.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I was shocked.  I'm like, wow.  Wow.  You can say that, huh? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  On TV.  Because in my world, it's just on TV.  It's not over-the-air broadcast.  No, I understand.  I know, but it might as well be.  It might as well be.  When was the last time you had an aerial?  Just the aerial, Murray.  When was the last time you had an antenna where you were getting TV like that?  Everyone's got cable, and even the most basic of cable offers you channels like MTV.  It comes with the package, you know?  Yeah.  FX, things like that, that will A&E.  Yeah.  Things that'll just put on programming with gritty language. 
[00:57:30]  Just let the gritty language be heard.  Everyone's heard it.  Let's stop being so...  Who's it really injuring?  Yeah.  Who's getting injured?  I don't know.  But Paris Hilton got smashed last night at the award.  Did she?  Yeah.  No, she wasn't drinking.  She just did.  Oh.  Sarah Silverman smashed her with a good line.  But before the show, Paris Hilton, just a couple of real quick clips about Paris Hilton  here.  This is her talking about jail.  And she snuck into jail overnight, everybody. 
[00:58:00]  Really?  A day early.  She went to jail early?  A day early.  Why would you do that?  To avoid the paparazzi, supposedly.  It's a big story today, Anthony.  Everyone's talking about how Paris Hilton snuck into jail a day early.  Oh, by the way, 14 of our boys were killed over the weekend.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Who cares, right?  You got to lead with Paris Hilton, right, news?  Yeah.  Scumbags.  We're not going to say that anymore.  No.  No.  No.  How about this? 
[00:58:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Scum.  Yes.  The news is scum.  Thank you, Jimmy, for helping me out there.  Yeah, they are.  Because they're leading with the Paris Hilton going to jail a day early story instead of  our boys dying in Iraq.  14 more killed over the weekend.  Bags.  Got something to say about that.  Eh, we'll talk about it later.  Just say it now.  With the Paris thing.  Say it now.  You know, something's got to be done.  And I know I'm going out on a limb here, but something's got to be done. 
[00:59:00]  More soldiers are dying every month.  It's an amazing body count that they're chalking up.  The original war when we first went in and took Baghdad, I believe it took something like  130 some odd lives before the Mission Accomplished banner went up and everything was done.  Uh, they're pretty much equaling that now on a monthly basis just because these, uh, insurgents 
[00:59:30]  are getting better at their job.  They're getting better at, at, at blowing up our soldiers, roadside bombs, small arms,  fire ambushes.  And our guys are being sent out in very small patrols that are very vulnerable.  There are a lot of new guys, 20 year old kids going out there, uh, on these very small  patrols, uh, with no real mission.  That seems to be the biggest argument that these soldiers, and it's, it's not an argument 
[01:00:00]  of the politicians.  This is, this is from the soldiers.  I've heard from a lot of soldiers, uh, that write to me.  Believe me, we have a lot of soldier fans that listen online and whatnot.  And it's the mission.  There's no, they say there's no mission here.  They don't have a thing to do.  Their mission is to walk around and hope they don't get killed and hope maybe they'll stumble  upon a cache of weapons that they can say, Hey, these are off the street now.  But what is happening is they are going on these small patrols and getting just decimated, 
[01:00:30]  decimated, torn to pieces.  And this is just the killed.  They're not even talking about the injury.  The injuries these guys are sustaining are mostly head injuries because that's, what's  poking out of the armored, uh, uh, carriers that they're in.  They're wearing the vests and everything, but their heads aren't protected.  So a lot of these are head injuries and the strategy here isn't changing.  No one's saying, okay, look, this isn't working. 
[01:01:00]  Us sending out these small patrols, the guys, I'm not saying, Oh, pull out, pull out.  We got to leave it, but change something overwhelming force.  And I, and you know why this isn't happening because it's politics.  And once you mix all these politics up with war, people on our side are going to die.  And that's what's happening.  We don't want to offend the government that's in place over there.  Now, you know, this government, they're supposed to have the say over what we can do and what 
[01:01:30]  we're allowed to do as far as take military action.  We have to, um, sit there and have a little meeting with these guys when we want to change  our strategy and they don't want us to run through their country.  Like we're still occupying it.  We're just helping them get into a position where they can defend themselves.  So we can't then, you want to clear a road.  Let's say you want our army, uh, to go from point A to point B and clear a road.  You get some eight, 10 warthogs. 
[01:02:00]  That road is cleared to planes, but there won't be one explosive left or one insurgent  left.  You will be able to drive down that road in a caddy if you wanted to with the top down,  but we're not allowed to do that.  You never hear about this massive air cover anymore in Iraq because we're not allowed to  do that because the government over there, uh, won't allow us to do that.  So they stay with the same strategy, small patrols, which are just getting chewed apart 
[01:02:30]  more and more people every single month.  And it's not going to stop until the strategy changes.  Yep.  And it's, it's disgusting me.  It's disgusting.  Why, why can't this idiot in charge change the policy and tell these, these people over  there in Iraq that are supposedly leading the country, uh, look, we have to do this for  self-preservation. 
[01:03:00]  Colin had the best line about it.  He said, we're trying to fight a polite war and it's the same way you're going to get  beat up here.  Stop being put either you, they're going to do it or just, yeah, war's ugly, overwhelming  force.  That's what you need to win a war.  Oh, we can't tell the insurgents from the civilians, martial law, curfews, shoot on site, things  like that.  That's how you win a war.  That's how you get the insurgency down raids with massive amounts of people. 
[01:03:30]  Don't send out patrols of four 20 year olds and a Lieutenant.  You're, they're going to get killed.  That's what's happening.  It's disgusting.  That's what's happening.  That's, that's my take on the whole thing.  The strategy has to change over there.  And with a lame duck in there, Bush wasn't doing anything anyway, but he's a lame duck  now.  So we can just look forward to another, you know, until January.  Uh, probably another thousand. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Probably another thousand dead.  There's already over 3,500, 3,700, uh, dead, uh, uncounted wounded.  I mean, and believe me, I don't care what happens to the Iraqis over there.  Civilian military insurgents.  I don't care about the Iraqi people over there.  They weren't, they weren't, uh, uh, rising up for their own freedom in the first place.  So the only way that happens is when a people get so oppressed that they say we have to change 
[01:04:30]  the way we're living and they rise up against their government.  You can't go in there and change people, uh, and want them to have freedom.  Uh, that's old news, but what we can do is do this the way it's supposed to be done with  overwhelming force.  Get it done as quickly and painlessly for our side as possible.  That's it.  Go in.  Overwhelming force.  Well, I guess this, uh, Paris Hilton clip doesn't really matter anymore.  Well, you know why?  Because the news ain't talking about it. 
[01:05:00]  No one else is talking about it.  Uh, so yeah, we talk about that first and now we'll go into entertainment news, Paris  Hilton going to jail.  That's what frustrates me.  Uh, and they call us just dopey.  They call us dopey shock jocks, but they're leading with Paris Hilton going to jail a day  or early today.  And the Lindsay Lohan pictures that came out, which are by the way, a year old, uh, putting  a knife to her girlfriend's throat.  They're partying, just fooling around with knives. 
[01:05:30]  Who doesn't have dopey pictures of yourselves doing stupid things?  When you're partying, you just do dumb stuff, but they're acting like, oh my God, you're  not going to believe the pictures of Lindsay Lohan and what she was doing.  Yeah.  And every, every person between the ages of, I don't know, 16 to hell all the way up to  60 are like, yep.  Yep.  That's what happens when you're partying.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  You just do dumb stuff.  Or you take these like staged funny, funny pictures.  Oh, here's a knife.  Let me hold it to your throat and snap a picture. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  Right.  It's like Lindsay Lohan was going to slice her friend's throat.  No, no.  I don't think so.  She was just goofing around because someone had a camera.  Yeah.  Like what?  Oh, you want a photo up?  Well, check this out.  That's all.  All right.  Now give me another beer and a line.  I got fun pictures with guns.  Doesn't mean I'm going to go out on a frigging ramp page.  This was before the MTV Movie Awards.  Let's just acknowledge after Ants are a rant.  This is like who gives a crap stuff.  But we already know that on this show.  You know, even though this is a scary thing, I'm using it in a positive way. 
[01:06:30]  And when I come out, I can't wait to start my new life and be even stronger than I am now.  Even stronger than I am now.  Start her new life.  How long is she in for?  Seven, eight years?  How long?  Uh, 23 days, but she could be out in a week, uh, if she's, if she's good.  Yeah.  She's acting like she's Mandela.  I know.  She's going to start a movement.  No, you're going away for, I'm going to guess she's in there for 10 days.  If she's lucky, she'll, uh, get, uh, roof tarring detail and, uh, be able to do the taxes 
[01:07:00]  for all the, all the guards.  Very good.  Get some beers.  Or maybe Wolf will hit on her in the shower.  And she'll have to fight him in the yard and go see English up at the top of the steps.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  How you doing?  I just, uh, I'm a two-time Iraq vet and I just wanted to say that you took the words  right out of my mouth.  Thank you.  Two-time vet, right?  Yeah.  Jesus, man. 
[01:07:30]  Thank you very much.  They're just not doing it right.  It's too politicized right now.  There's too much politics being played and, uh, politics and war never work.  Doesn't work.  They're saying, listen to your goddamn generals on the ground.  They need more guys and more force and less rules.  They can't be listening to this fake Iraqi government.  And it is fake.  Stop it.  They can't get along with each other.  There's civil war going on over there.  And, uh, we're listening to them as to what we should or shouldn't do as far as our own 
[01:08:00]  soldiers go.  Movement.  The four guys going out on a patrol is not an overwhelming show of force.  It's a suicide mission.  All right, Steve.  Annoying.  Thank you, Steve.  God bless you, Steve.  No, thank you.  You took the words out of my mouth once again.  I appreciate it.  All right, Steve.  Take care.  And then, uh, and then Sarah Silverman just smashed, uh, Paris Hilton and she had to sit  there in the audience and take it.  Oh man.  Was she just angry? 
[01:08:30]  Was she angry too?  She couldn't take a joke?  Oh, wow.  Was she angry?  And then she kind of tried to like smile through it.  This is the, this is the line from last night's MTV movie awards.  In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Thank you.  The judge says that it's going to be a no frills thing and that is ridiculous. 
[01:09:00]  She is totally going to get special treatment.  As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel like more comfortable in prison, the  guards are going to paint the bars to look like penises.  Is that?  That's not bad.  I think it's wrong too.  I just worry that she's going to break her teeth on those things.  Anyway. 
[01:09:30]  Nicholson's there.  Yeah.  All right.  Nicholson was just a babbling ass.  He got up there.  Yeah.  If we could get his, people hinted that he was on something, man.  Where was this shot?  I don't even know.  Probably LA.  LA.  Yeah.  It looked like it was LA, I guess.  So there you go.  Sarah is smashing her.  And then they showed a shot of Paris in the audience and she was not happy.  It's like, whatever, dude.  Take it.  Exactly.  You're taking a shot up.  You did nothing.  Right.  Believe me.  I think she's going to have more problems in prison than she is at the MTV movie awards. 
[01:10:00]  I think she might have a little problem.  Is she going to be in private or something?  Like, they should, you know, is she going to have to shower in a public, like, no, no way.  Could you just say she is?  Because that's kind of like really hot to think those big prison showers and just there.  And you're just seeing her completely naked.  The tough prison babes.  Trying to wash her hair.  She's got soap in her eyes.  And then the tough prison babe comes over. 
[01:10:30]  Hey.  Someone watches the door.  Someone turns the lights off.  Yeah, yeah.  The guard all of a sudden, like, somebody walks in.  The guard looks, nods, and leaves.  Oh, you're like, oh, no, here it comes.  Yeah, baby.  Here it comes.  The water shuts off.  She's like, oh, what?  The water shut off.  She's still got soap in her eyes.  And then she's just getting groped.  Nice.  Who doesn't like a good prison babe for that?  And scene.  Yeah, here.  There's the reaction for Jimmy.  She's not too happy.  She looks good, though.  Ah, she's getting a little, uh... 
[01:11:00]  Who saw her going to jail?  Maybe she showed up there to throw the paparazzi off.  Why am I speculating?  She showed up there to get a war show to throw the paparazzi off.  No, no, no, no.  They wouldn't think she was going to jail, I'm saying.  No one would think that right after that she's going to jail.  Oh.  That was where the after party was.  Jail.  She has a lovely neck, though.  I'd like to kiss it.  She's got a very slender neck.  She's wonderful.  It's snapped out like a chicken.  I just want to kiss it.  She, uh...  She's starting to look a lot more like her mom these days. 
[01:11:30]  Is she?  A little long in the tooth.  All that partying's starting to take its toll on her.  Wait until prison life gets a hold of her.  Here comes Kenny.  What's up, Kenny?  Hi, Ken.  No, I heard on 1010's Win News, the big thing...  1010's Win News thing.  The big thing is like half a million dollars to the paparazzi to get a picture of her in her prison garb.  Oh, yeah?  Half a mil?  Yeah.  Wow, somebody, one of the guards are going to snap that.  Little cell phone, it's done.  Should have just posed with somebody.  Yeah, she probably will.  She'll go in the yard. 
[01:12:00]  She's all about that crap.  Can I point to the, uh, too, because after your little verbal flub made me think real quick.  I was at Morton's last night having a fine meal, and they met her.  Dee comes over, and he goes, dude, I've got to say I'm a big fan.  My favorite Opie and Anthony moment, which is a big fan of the show, was when Voss was on one time,  and he was talking about some woman getting an operation, and he goes, is it called a hysterectomial?  I have been laughing about that since last night.  What a dummy Rich Voss is.  Hysterectomial.  Oh, is he as stupid as he could possibly be as a man? 
[01:12:30]  I think Voss is coming in Friday, so.  Oh, thank God.  Oh, the fun will ensue on Friday.  All right, yeah, we've got to take a break, sure.  Verbal faux pas.  We'll figure out what else is going on in America today also.  I thought Steve from Bayshore, what does Kenny sip Novocaine instead of coffee in the morning?  What's wrong with you, Kenny?  Tens, tens, win, news.  He had a long weekend taking care of Jimmy down there in D.C.  He just doesn't know where to put his S's, that's all.  Yeah.  It's cute. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  He's stupid.  I think we're going to be looking at girly magazines next.  Girly magazines?  Yeah.  Like nudes?  We gave the guys a little project.  Yeah.  A little homework assignment.  We forced them to look at the magazines women look at.  Oh, not girly, because I thought you meant girly magazine like a nude magazine, like swank.  No, we forced them to pick up like a copy of Cosmopolitan.  Women's Home Journal.  All that crap. 
[01:13:30]  Mary Claire or Marie Claire.  What is that?  I don't know.  And Us Weekly, all those dumb magazines that the women just love gobbling up.  And we told them to bring an interesting article to the show.  Oh, all right.  Well, what do they find interesting about those magazines?  We're going to find out next.  You know, I mean, we've all seen it on the news, man.  You've thumbed through it in like a doctor's office, maybe.  There's just nothing but that crap.  You know, like seven great positions for great sex. 
[01:14:00]  How to keep your man happy in the bedroom.  You know, all that dumb stuff.  Working on a budget.  Keeping your house working on a budget.  Budget.  Is it 1955?  So the guys all have picked out their favorite article that they found over the weekend.  Great.  We'll do that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:14:30]  92.3 K-Rush.  How great is that, huh?  That just petrified me, by the way.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I say things sometimes.  And then because I'm commenting on the television behind me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when I turn and watch it, I can't see you.  So I said something.  Turn around and you had your headphones on.  And I look at the mics to see if they were on.  Because if they were, oh, boy, that was a doozy, I said. 
[01:15:00]  It was about, I guess, the weatherman here.  What's his name?  Sam Champion?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said something about Sam Champion.  That may have been a bit naughty.  They just played on Good Morning America.  It's your video of the day.  It's everywhere.  Actually, go to break.com.  It's on the front page.  Minor League Baseball Manager goes nuts.  Oh, the guy took it to a whole new level.  I know we got the Lou Piniella thing.  He's, what, suspended indefinitely?  Yeah.  Like Billy Martin and Earl Weaver did that for years. 
[01:15:30]  He kicked dirt on the umpire.  But I think Lou bumped him.  And once you bump the umpire, you are finished.  You're out.  Earl Weaver used to turn his cap around backwards.  Because if the brim of your cap touched the umpire, you were done.  Yeah, they turn it around and get right.  So you could get closer to their face.  And just yell at them.  Yeah, so Lou Piniella's been getting a lot of attention.  But now we got this Minor League Baseball Manager going nuts.  And they're showing it all over the TV today.  Guy's hilarious.  He took second and third base and went home.  He, like, crawled on the dirt toward the mound. 
[01:16:00]  Picked up the rosin as a grenade and threw it at the umpire.  Yeah.  Buried home plate.  Completely.  It just goes on and on.  It's on break.com getting a lot of attention today.  Guy's just an ass.  And dumb Diane Sawyer played on Good Morning America.  And then she looks at the camera all confused.  Like, who would do that?  Why would you do something like that?  That's really strange.  Yeah.  Through her fuzzy camera.  Through her cotton ball camera.  It's like they just loaded the camera lens up with cotton balls and tried to film her through it. 
[01:16:30]  You know, like, it's the law to, you know, to really smoke out your bathroom windows.  Yeah.  So the pervs in your neighborhood don't get a peek.  Right.  Well, that's the type of camera they're now using for Diane Sawyer.  That's the lens.  Right.  That's the lens.  The lens on the camera, they're just using that fuzzy glass block.  Right.  And they screw it into the front.  And that's what you see.  Ah, this should ensure that she's on TV for another year.  That's good.  We can't see the crow's feet through this.  What is it? 
[01:17:00]  A cinder block.  We're filming through cinder blocks.  If they shot her real, you know what she looks like?  She looks like, like, you ever see Dracula when he gets exposed to the light?  Yeah, yeah.  Two frames before he's dust.  So he turns to dust.  Go back two frames.  Yeah.  There you have it.  The cape is just barely hanging on.  And he still has a little skeletal expression and a tuft of blonde Tanner Boyle hair.  I finally had to give up on her, too.  I thought she was hot, like, last year, the year before. 
[01:17:30]  But finally, I'm out.  I'm out.  I'm out.  The old bang.  I'm out.  Eventually, I think they'll do Good Morning America, just a really long shot.  That would be hilarious.  Where it's like when you turn binoculars around and look around.  Right, right, right.  She's a mile away.  Is that?  Who are they got?  All right.  Let's bring in the guys and see what they picked.  From their women's magazines.  Well, it's the female playbook. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Things like Cosmo, I guess.  All that crap.  Cosmopolitan magazine.  It's the female playbook.  The women picked this up, and they get a tip or two.  My mommy used to, like, collect her Cosmos.  She wouldn't throw them away, so she had a big cedar chest in her room full of Cosmo magazines.  And I got to tell you, growing up as a kid, maybe 11, 12 years old, great material to take care of yourself with.  Cosmo was back then.  I don't know if it is now because I haven't looked through it. 
[01:18:30]  But, yeah, yeah, there'd be a lot of, like, lingerie things, women.  And in the back, it was Cosmo tells all.  And there was one nude picture of a girl in there.  Sometimes it was just kind of the side of the breast shot.  Sometimes it was just from the back, like a butt shot or something.  But sometimes you'd get full frontal.  And that was just, back then, one, two, three strikes, you're out.  Just back out playing with the old friends.  There you go.  That was a quickie. 
[01:19:00]  That's all you needed, though.  That's it.  You didn't want to spend too much time on that.  No.  You just had to get the poison out and then get back out there to play army.  That's it.  Play army.  Yeah.  Pressure release valve done.  All right.  All right.  Back out.  Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat.  Right.  Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat.  I got you.  All right.  I figured out who Diane Sawyer looks like, by the way.  Go ahead.  Without being in HD, without being in that soft light, she looks exactly like McCartney.  She looks like Paul McCartney.  Paul McCartney.  Yeah, the skinny, wrinkled, stupid face. 
[01:19:30]  An old woman.  That's exactly what she looks like.  She looks like an old sitcom character, and it's driving me nuts.  It's like an obscure sitcom character that had kind of a lesser.  Ethel Mertz.  She had like a lesser role on one of these sitcoms in like the late 70s, early 80s.  And it's driving me nuts.  And I know if I come up with it, Anne's going to be very impressed.  Andy from WKRP in Cincinnati.  All right.  Who goes first?  You guys decide.  Danny.  All right.  Danny. 
[01:20:00]  Danny.  All right.  Danny's going to start us off.  So the homework assignment, these guys had the weekend to go through the female playbook  and come up with an article they found interesting enough to bring to the show.  Oh.  A little copy.  And Danny is handing out the article he found interesting.  It's from Cosmo.  Wow.  And he just handed it to us.  It's sex tips from guys.  From guys.  All right, ladies. 
[01:20:30]  Listen up.  This is what all the guys want.  Sex tips from guys.  Every time you see the cover of Cosmo and see sex tips from guys on the cover, I just  imagine women going, oh, this is just what we need.  This is what I need.  This is coming right from the source.  This is what I need to spice it up in the bedroom.  Oh.  Whoa.  All right, Danny.  Go ahead.  Sex tips from guys.  Grab.  Crank.  Repeat.  Exactly.  Gulp.  Look at window.  Throw self out. 
[01:21:00]  I mean, this came from the online edition of Cosmos.  It was much, much, much to choose from.  By the way, I got interrupted just because it's always good to get an E-Rock line in.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  E-Rock picked 101 uses for mayo.  Oh.  All right.  Go ahead there, Danny.  Sorry.  So they had different categories, I suppose.  It was, you know, like things to do, trying getting the guy, things to do in bed, things 
[01:21:30]  to do after.  Oh, wow.  Run the whole gamut of things.  So, yeah, I just tried to compile some of the more radio-friendly things, except for some  of the ones on the bottom there.  Oh, I see that.  We could even work around those.  We'll try.  The first tip says, let me know you're in the mood by picking up the palm of my, I'm  sorry, by picking up my palm and darting your tongue against it.  It's an unusual move, but it's erotic at the same time.  Not good advice.  No.  It depends on what she does for a living. 
[01:22:00]  Like, for instance, if she's perhaps an esthetician, that might be acceptable.  But if she happens to, say, work on a stud farm with old racehorses.  Artificially inseminating horses.  And her job is to collect the bucket full.  Well, see, it's sex tip from guys, so the woman would be doing this to you.  She'd be licking your palm.  She'd lick your hand.  Let me know you're in the mood by picking up my palm and darting. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, okay.  I got it.  Well, again, it would have to be occupation.  You know, if you're cleaning the bathrooms at the chemo ward, I don't think the girl wants  to lick your palm.  Anyone have that happen to them?  I don't want my palm licked.  I don't either, man.  They're getting their advice from Caddyshack.  Huh?  Remember that?  When Noonan and Lacey Underalls were at the dock?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she licked the palm of his hand.  Okay, sure.  And she was reading her palm, you know, this is how hot I can get you, and she licked his 
[01:23:00]  palm.  See, this is why that stinks, because all I can think about is the girl's breath on my  palm now, and I can smell my palm.  Smelling it all night?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you, at some point, too, like, wow, that's kind of, you know, oh, you'd have to  feign that it was sexy, because you don't want to ruin the night, so you're like, oh,  whoa.  But then all night, you're waiting for her to look away so you could wipe your pants with your  hand and not offend her?  Don't lick a guy's hand.  Stop it.  Absolutely.  Unless he's holding something important.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  That's how you have to get yourself into it, whatever.  Whatever you've got to say to keep yourself from not doing this.  Wherever you want to start, the hand is fine, but we know where you've got to finish.  Let's go to Keith in Massapequa.  Keith, what's up?  What's up, guys?  The Diane Sawyer looks like the mom from Bewitched.  And Dora?  Whatever her name is.  A little bit.  This was a sitcom character, lesser role.  Not a looker.  Adam Rich.  Gave the impression that she might play for the same team. 
[01:24:00]  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, bud.  I'll come up with it eventually.  All right.  Go ahead, Danny.  Continue.  Sex tips from guys.  This is what the girls are reading out there.  Well, the next one is, when we're just lying on the couch and watching TV, let your feet  wander in my lap and start exploring.  Who?  What if you're Paul McCartney?  She could let her foot wander in his lap and go grab a snack at the same time. 
[01:24:30]  While your one foot's wandering, make sure you put alcohol rub on your stump so it doesn't  smell the whole room up.  So, a little foot job, huh?  Yeah.  This doesn't seem like things you do maybe on the first date or anything.  This is more like you've been in a relationship and I guess you're trying to find new things  to do.  But this is guys.  This is what guys are telling women they like to happen to them.  Apparently, this is this person's advice to all the women out there. 
[01:25:00]  But doesn't, do these women understand that that right then ends any of this fun and games?  Like the second her foot hits the lap, you're having sex.  You're like, that's pretty much it.  The second it hits your lap.  I don't know if I was just watching.  And my girlfriend tried this once and I swear kicked me square right where it hurts so bad.  My girlfriend is the king of kicking me in the sensitive area that is dangling. 
[01:25:30]  Just every single time in bed, we'll be laying in bed and like she'll pick her knee up.  I'll be like, I'll be close to her and we're kind of face to face and asleep and she'll bend  her knee and just wham, just nail me.  Or she's getting out of bed and one foot will slip and wham, the heel goes right in. 
[01:26:00]  She just kicks me there all the time.  So I don't think that's what they mean either.  Kick them squarely in the sack.  Women have no idea how sensitive that area is.  Oh.  Because they see what we can do with it.  Yeah.  For some reason, you can't even like barely flick it or anything.  But yet in some circumstances, it could slam against something.  It's amazing.  Numerous times.  Wham!  Wham!  Wham!  I think we confuse them because they see what we can do with it. 
[01:26:30]  But it's beyond sensitive if touched the wrong way.  My girlfriend has no...  It's amazing how little they know.  She'll actually light a match and then blow it out and then touch it to it.  See, that's not good.  If this were only a man's size.  All right.  What else there, Danny?  I'm going to skip over that next one.  I can see there.  But here's another one.  When you grab my arms, hold them over my head and lick around my armpits. 
[01:27:00]  I'm putty?  This is sex tips from guys and he finishes by saying, I'm putty if you do that.  Yeah.  Well, apparently this guy, he seems to enjoy it and feels that maybe the rest of the American  men out there would love it too.  Hey, Elaine, lick around my armpits.  My girlfriend is never...  Yeah, right?  My girlfriend is never licking my armpits.  No!  No way.  Stay away from my armpits.  No, no, no, no, no.  Eesh.  All right, continue.  These are awful.  They're terrible, dude. 
[01:27:30]  Well, that's why this...  No wonder.  That's why this is fun.  This is what the women are doing with their playbooks.  Getting bad advice from guys that seem a little fruity.  Horrid advice.  Here's another one.  When you give a hello kiss after a long day at work, don't hesitate to grab my package.  It's on and he says, it's like, hello.  Hello.  It's like, hello.  Yeah.  Hello.  They put a little dash between the two L's in hello when they spelt it. 
[01:28:00]  So it's, hello.  That's great advice to give women.  So there's a million women that don't know what they're doing and are just freaking squeezing.  Yeah.  All right.  What else?  Let's see.  Lightly caress the sensitive webbing between my thumb and forefinger.  It's a lusty pressure point.  It's not.  What?  This?  Right here?  Yeah, apparently.  Anything you wouldn't be afraid to do to another man because it is so non-sexual. 
[01:28:30]  Come here, Danny.  Give me your hand.  Look.  I'm rubbing the webbing between his thumb and forefinger because it is so non-sexual.  Wow, you got excited.  I did.  Because that is so non-exciting or sexual.  All right.  Hold on.  Now we're getting some calls coming in.  This is what we want.  Nicole in Buffalo listening on the edge.  What's up, Nicole?  I've done the foot thing before watching a movie with my boyfriend.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  And it actually works.  Well, we didn't say it wouldn't work.  I'm just saying that pretty much ends any more playing around.  Oh, no.  I mean, like, it brought it straight to full foreplay.  Do you understand that anything you would rub like that on your boyfriend during a movie,  you could go grab a mop and rub that and he'll want to have sex.  All right.  Nicole says it works.  Thank you, Nicole.  You're welcome.  All right.  What else there, Danny?  This gentleman says that your woman should lick spots on your wrists, inner elbows, and 
[01:29:30]  backs of your knees, and that'll wake up areas that have been sleeping for years.  What is wrong with this guy?  That's true, actually.  But he wants every part that's not at all sexual.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  But women like that when you lick them there.  You suck a girl's wrists or by her elbows.  Women love that.  It does feel good.  Inner elbows over here?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, up in the back of my knees?  Yeah, it's really sensitive.  That stuff is very sexy.  Sounds like that next one. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, no, I don't think I can say that.  There's something so taboo about, well, you know how you take care of your girl.  There's a sex tip from guys.  Where she can just relax, you know, and you take care of her.  She doesn't have to do the heavy lifting.  Right.  She's not doing any lifting.  Right.  She's just relaxing.  You're doing all the work.  And then you wake up and it feels like you chewed a whole pack of hubba bubba for hours  on end. 
[01:30:30]  So you do that, but not in the normal circumstance.  She would be in a position where it would be like she was ready to give someone a pony  ride.  Ah.  There you go.  And you do that take care of business thing.  There's something so taboo about that.  I'll tell you why.  Because normally if you go to a restaurant and you're having a fine meal.  Right.  You always want to be careful where your nose is.  Right.  You don't want a table by the bathroom. 
[01:31:00]  That's fine.  What's taboo about that?  Well, we've got to take a break, Danny.  Danny's almost done with the article he found.  You get a good view.  You can still watch the game.  Sex tips from guys from Cosmo.  By the way, being in that particular, like you're ready to give someone a pony ride  while your girlfriend, you know, reciprocates is also fantastic.  That's very taboo for a woman to do that to a guy, not for a guy to do that to a woman.  For a woman to do that to a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  See, that isn't.  It's taboo.  That taboo. 
[01:31:30]  And it's lovely.  All right.  By the way, I heard this one time.  It was fantastic.  That's great.  Any others you want to add to this?  Yeah, let's see.  This one I don't understand.  Watching a woman do yoga is the hottest foreplay you could have without touching each other.  I guess if she's naked, naked yoga, and she'd have to be kind of good at it.  I don't want to see her naked trying to pull herself into the lotus position and not being able to do it. 
[01:32:00]  Snapping a knee.  I broke my knee, man.  Yeah, it depends on the outfit she's wearing.  I would prefer nothing.  I wouldn't mind a skimpy, like a skin-tight thing.  Boy shorts.  Yeah.  But my girlfriend's doing yoga.  I wouldn't need to see that.  That would be great if it was a stranger because my girlfriend I've seen do everything already.  Yeah.  Yeah, no offense, but.  Offense taken, I'm sure.  Jesus.  All right, you got it.  I don't find her sexy at all when whatever she does. 
[01:32:30]  No, I don't mean this.  I don't mean that.  Of course you don't.  Hey, we got to take a break because we got Frank Vincent calling to talk about the unbelievable  Sopranos episode last night.  But the last one is hilarious.  Cosmo, sex tips from guys.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, okay.  How do we say we got to get this on the radio?  Well, the last half of this says, like you're applying lipstick.  Now, obviously, the lady is not using lipstick. 
[01:33:00]  She's using something else that could be a large version of lipstick.  Depending on your nationality.  Right, exactly.  But you're supposed to use that like you're using lipstick.  Like you're applying lipstick.  Like you're applying lipstick.  There you go.  Cosmo's sex tips from guys.  And there's a bunch more where this came from.  There's a lot more where that came from.  All right.  I think you got some of the better ones out there.  Wow, there's some good ones. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  A couple of really, the really dirty ones are really good.  The tickle and tug one is good.  I was just reading that one.  That's very true.  But be careful.  Yeah, of course.  They used to wear gingerly.  But proceed gingerly.  Yeah.  You don't want to just tickle and then tug like you're ejecting from a plane that's about to crash.  Yeah, pulling the handle.  Punch out, goose.  All of a sudden, you jump up and hit your head against the ceiling. 
[01:34:00]  Maverick has to cradle you.  Hey, Dave is pointing out something very obvious here.  Dave and Philly, go ahead.  Hey, I just wanted to say with that foot thing that not every woman has perfectly smooth model quality feet.  That's true.  You get a woman with some nasty feet and she could be wreaking some havoc on your sensitive areas.  Big Doritos toenail.  Toenail that looks like a corn chip. 
[01:34:30]  Her bunion.  Her bunion.  Dude, you got the corn chip streak going, man.  I think this is three days in a row.  Maybe four.  You got to talk.  You got to work the corn chip toenail scenario into every show.  Corn chip toenail.  Oh, that big nasty yellow.  You know, it's like big and thick.  You know, I was on my way.  It's good for dip.  Yeah, you can dip with it.  Oh, there you go.  There's what he's talking about right there.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock. 
[01:35:00]  That's just making E-Rock hungry.  I was on the way to corn.  I was on the way to corn chip toenails.  No.  Went to the doctor.  Now, I think I only have a third of a liver because the medicine I use kills your liver.  But I got crystal clear toenails again.  Did you have those little monsters that they show in the commercials ripping apart your nail bed?  How horrific is that?  They lift up your toenail like a car hood.  Mine were getting thick and separated from my actual toe.  Went to the doctor. 
[01:35:30]  Only on like two or three toes out of ten.  And they gave me this medication that kills your liver.  But it makes your toenails crystal clear.  Thank God.  So I'm back to normal, sort of.  But your liver could be screwy.  I just can't drink ever again.  But price you pay for good toenails.  You kill.  I can look at my toenail and I can actually see a face pressed up like someone drowned under ice.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right, Danny.  Good job.  Danny brought in a fine article.  Yes.  Who can we look forward to after the break?  We got Clubster to Kenny.  We got Roland. 
[01:36:00]  E-Rock, maybe?  E-Rock.  Maybe E-Rock.  Jeff from Jersey.  Jeff from Jersey quickly.  I don't even think we have to.  Well, if you want to go to him.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, what's up?  What are you going to say?  Because I agree with you.  Yeah, you guys are probably already suspecting this.  But this has got to be women who write this stuff.  I'm actually horrified that some women might be listening to this crap.  That's what I think, too.  I think women are in there writing like, hey, could you write an article as if it was the man's point of view on what he would like women to do?  Because it's crap. 
[01:36:30]  For the women listening, I just want to tell you.  Listen, if you want to know what we like, watch some porn movies.  That's what we like.  There you go.  It's not rocket science.  There you go.  Thanks, Jeff.  Yeah, it's probably women just sitting around in a conference room trying to figure this crap out.  Oh, I think you're thinking of Catherine Hellman, who was on soap.  Oh, could be.  Could you look her up, please, for me?  Diane Sawyer looks like someone.  And don't look up Hellman's mayonnaise.  He just can't help it.  He puts in the first few letters.  That might be it, though.  That might be it. 
[01:37:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll be back with hopefully Frank Vincent next.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  Hey, we got to get right into this.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Big star on the line.  Big star.  Let's say hi to Frank Vincent, a friend of the show.  What's up, Frank?  Hey, you guys being good or what?  Yeah, yeah.  We're being good.  Don't whack us, Frank. 
[01:37:30]  Don't whack us.  Hey, you never know, man.  Wow, Frank.  Now we got something to talk about, Frank.  Okay, let's go.  Now we got something to talk about.  You are the man.  No mercy.  Wow.  No mercy.  My God.  Last night was a great, great episode.  They're saying one of the best ever.  Yes.  Frank.  So it was really high tension and a lot of stuff going on, yeah.  Well, I mean, now obviously they said you guys have been shooting different endings, 
[01:38:00]  like so nobody technically knows the ending, right?  Is that correct?  Well, everybody shot their own thing.  I only shot one thing for the ending.  Now, I don't know what they shot, what Jimmy shot or anybody else shot.  You know, I mean, I knew about what happened last night.  I knew that was going to happen.  Now, I don't know what's going to happen next week in terms of the rest of the show.  All right, where is Phil hiding?  It's been annoying me all night.  You put a hit out on Tony and Bacala and Silvio, and then all of a sudden you disappear. 
[01:38:30]  At least tell us where you're hiding.  Well, he put a hit out on Tony.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, especially Tony.  Yeah, the top three guys.  He's with his wife.  He's hiding in the mountains.  Aha.  In the mountains.  In the mountains.  With his wife.  You are something in that show.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  This is some of the most brutal stuff now.  Well, I liked the way Bacala died. 
[01:39:00]  Wasn't that great?  Had you seen that scene yet, or did you watch them shoot that?  No.  I saw it.  What I saw last night, I saw it for the first time.  Like you saw it.  I don't see.  We don't see anything.  That was so beautifully shot.  Because, I mean, he's standing there, just this big mope talking about trains, and you  know he's about to be murdered.  I'm going to go for it.  Yeah, I'm going to get all of it.  I'm going to, you know, this is one.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to get it.  And you're like, ah, a big fat man just wants a choo-choo.  Yeah, right.  Alan Taylor is the director of that episode.  I'm sure he's going to be nominated for that episode. 
[01:39:30]  It was so good.  It was not even just the fact that he was killed.  It was the way, as the gunmen are approaching Bacala to kill him, they show like this head-on  shot of the train on the tracks, and they're, like, going to people who are hiding as he's  being murdered, and they clip to a quick, one of the little figurines on the train set  that's covering its face.  It was so well done, man.  It was really beautifully shot.  Brilliant.  Brilliant.  Wow.  All right.  So you obviously, at the beginning of the season, told us that your role really picked  up a lot, and you weren't kidding. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, you weren't kidding.  I'm glad we stood by you there, Frank.  Yeah, I stood by you.  The first couple episodes, and we're like, wow, why are we talking to Frank Vincent?  Yeah, where is he?  Where is he?  Right, right.  Please tell me that Melfi gets popped.  Yeah.  Did somebody pop Melfi?  Maybe Tony's going to pop her.  Frank, give us something.  Come on.  Let's just blow it up for everybody.  You know the ending.  Let's go.  Let's make history together.  The last show you want me to give you something?  Yeah, the last show.  Yeah, let's go.  Let's go.  Now he's going to blab.  Look what fun you had all this time. 
[01:40:30]  See?  You're a good friend of the show, though.  You know, we'll be in all the press clippings.  I'll give you something.  But what's really going to happen is Tony and Phil are going to ride, get in a convertible  and ride off the cliff like Tom and Louise.  That would be the end of the crowd.  We were saying how great it would be if something completely bizarre, like if Tony just came  out of the closet and walked off with a transgendered friend and it was never explained.  Right.  Or maybe Tony goes into the bookstore and he reads A Man's Guide to Being a Man's Man. 
[01:41:00]  Is that right?  A Man's Guide to Being a Man's Man.  A Man's Guide to Being a Man's Man.  That's right, huh?  See that, Frank?  We always plug.  I appreciate it.  And then Frank comes in and sees him reading it and then goes, ah, he's a nice enough guy  and leaves him alone.  That's right.  And I'll give him a go home and get you a shine box t-shirt.  Yeah.  Well, right away I put hits out on him and his friends.  He's getting fresh.  Hey, Frank.  Any people talking about a movie?  No, what I'm hearing in the corners of the rooms is that David is interested in maybe 
[01:41:30]  doing a prequel.  Now, I don't know what that would mean.  That means Tony's dies.  I don't know if Jimmy's up for that.  I know Jimmy's got a big contract with HBO now to do some producing.  I think Jimmy's probably going to lay low now for a little while and get Tony Soprano  out of his mind a little bit.  They should do a movie and just make believe nothing happened yet.  Bring back everybody and just start over.  You know what?  It would be a smash, smash hit.  Hey, Frank, what happened with Phil that he went from, you know, because even Tony brought 
[01:42:00]  it up in one of the episodes where you were in the hospital and you kind of had a moment  with Tony.  And, you know, what happened to Phil that made him so ruthless and put him in this position?  Well, he did the scene in the club with the kids and he explained how his name was really  Leonardo and they made it Leotardo. 
[01:42:30]  And then he lost his patience.  He says, he's tired of compromise.  He's tired of compromise.  No more of this.  So he completely swung the other way.  And he looked at his brother's photograph up on the wall.  And then when Tony came in, he said, you know, you want to cut you?  What compromise?  He said, I was 20 years.  I wanted Monogat.  He said, I had grilled cheese off the radiator.  And I wanted a woman.  And, you know, what else he said? 
[01:43:00]  Right.  And so he said, it's all over.  No more compromise.  We're going to go for it.  So he just, yeah, stuck to his guns and that's it.  Now you're going balls out.  Now he's going out.  Yeah.  He's going after the prize.  I like it.  Were you surprised they killed Christopher off the way they did?  Oh, it was interesting.  That read-through, when we all read that script, everybody just sat silently.  The silence for like three minutes and everybody was looking at each other and it was amazing. 
[01:43:30]  Because I think at that point, the realization that it was coming to an end hit everybody.  Right.  Yeah.  Because that's obviously one of the main characters during the entire show.  Yeah.  So we all sat around the table reading that.  And when it was over, I think Edie was crying and Jimmy was looking at, you know, it's a big room.  And Jimmy was looking at Christopher.  Christopher was looking at him.  Michael, you know.  And the realization hit everybody, yeah. 
[01:44:00]  You guys read a table reading, you just do it.  It's like a big square of tables, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every episode we get, we sit, the entire cast.  And usually the fringe talent also.  But in this case, in the last three or four read-throughs, there was no fringe talent.  They used some production people to read the other parts.  What prevents, now obviously you guys have contracts to big actors, but what prevents a boom guy or a camera guy from leaking it to the paper? 
[01:44:30]  Nothing.  Nothing.  In fact, they leaked Michael's death, I think.  Yeah, yeah, they did.  Yep.  I wasn't reading any spoilers though.  Yeah.  There's like, there's like when we start shooting it, when you're on the set, there's got to be 60, 70 people on the set, you know.  And they're not all going to be loyal.  They're all looking out to better themselves by maybe throwing a tip out there.  That'd be great.  You find out who it is and actually act like your characters and just beat the crap out of them.  Right.  Just kicking them on the floor, stomp his face. 
[01:45:00]  Up to now, like your character again has gotten so interesting and really become a huge part of the show.  What is, could you find something you'd say was your favorite moment for Phil or as an actor to do on the show so far?  Well, again, I think the transition that the scene with the kids is great and the follow-up scene to that.  And actually yesterday's conversation where he said, you know, they don't even know how to make people over there, meaning that they don't know how to make them, you know, make them part of the crew. 
[01:45:30]  They said they don't even use blood.  They don't even put a sword on the table.  That's all funny stuff if you really analyze it.  And doing that stuff was fun.  That was a really good, nice scene to work.  You got any films or anything you're doing?  Because you always seem to pop up in these great Scorsese movies and have huge parts.  Well, I'm looking at a film now called Survival.  It's about a jewel thief here in Florida and we might be doing it in July. 
[01:46:00]  It looks like it's going to happen.  Yeah.  Hey, Frank, do you know the ending of The Sopranos?  Yeah.  Oh, you definitely know what's going to happen next week.  Well, I know what I know.  I don't know if he's changed anything.  Right, right.  You think he's tricking everybody, though?  Because they have said there's three or four endings, I guess.  I know what happens to Phil for sure.  You know, I know where that goes.  Oh, okay, what?  Yeah, what happens?  You can tell us.  You can tell us.  We won't say anything.  We'll keep it under our hats.  He rides off with Tony in the sunset.  No, Frank, we're off the air now.  We're off the air. 
[01:46:30]  They're playing commercials.  So what happens?  Wouldn't it be funny if Frank was just drunk and spit it out?  Damn.  You'd be surprised.  Well, I can't wait, and a bunch of people, I'm sure, can't wait.  The big finale.  Is it going to be an hour?  Is it going to be, well, are you going to throw us an extra ten minutes?  I think it's probably going to be just a regular length.  That's what I understood.  This one seems short.  Because DVR, I watched it live, actually, but it came out at like 47 minutes. 
[01:47:00]  It was a little shorter than I wanted.  You cheap bastards.  Do an hour.  You're killing us.  We look at the clock.  We go, oh, we got ten minutes left, and the show's over.  We're going for the commercials for A&E, you know?  Yeah.  Well, we're loving, loving, loving this season, and your character is just great, man.  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  You guys set it up nice for next Sunday.  That's good.  You make a...  Good luck to you guys.  You guys, I heard little stories about you, you know?  We got jammed up a little bit there, Frank, but we took care of business. 
[01:47:30]  I'll take care of business like Phil does.  Yeah, I wish we could.  Believe me.  I'd love to just sit around with just a bunch of guys with guns and go, all right, we'll  shoot him, him, and him.  How much fun that...  It must suck to come back to real life and realize you have to call creepy agents and lawyers  instead of just some guys to do your dirty work.  All right there, Frank.  Thanks a lot for...  Hey, hey, don't forget about a man's man.  What?  We want to be a man's man.  A man's man.  All right, the plugs.  Hey, come on out.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[01:48:00]  What's the name of the book, Frank?  Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man.  FrankVincent.com.  Go home and get your Shinebox t-shirts.  And Phil Leotardo t-shirts and mouse bands.  The whole thing.  Hey, Frank, thanks for the loyalty, by the way.  You've been with us pretty much every Monday this season.  We really appreciate that.  What Monday to do.  Very cool.  All right.  Good luck this week, and we'll talk to you next week.  When I come back to New York, I'll come on the show with you guys.  Absolutely.  Okay, guys.  Bye, Frank.  Thank you, Frank.  Thank you.  FrankVincent, everyone. 
[01:48:30]  There he goes.  Our newest, bestest pal.  Yeah, I love FrankVincent.  FrankVincent.  Love him.  Hey, before we take a break and get back to the girly magazine bit, Jimmy was commenting  about our pal who's coming in Thursday.  Chuck Liddell, yeah.  Ouch.  Him and his manager, Rita, they enjoy the show when I got stuff sent to me.  He just pitched a pair of shorts.  That's cool.  And I was very bummed out.  He lost, man, to Rampage Jackson.  He got knocked out.  Chuck got knocked out, man.  That is a tough goddamn business to be in, Ultimate Fighting.  And wow, he got clipped and went down. 
[01:49:00]  And then this guy, what's his name?  Rampage Jackson.  Rampage Jackson just got down on top of him and started punching him about the face in  a very hard fashion.  Well, he has nine years on Chuck, too, man.  Like, these guys are not like boxers who can, like, go.  And boxers are tough dudes, but don't get me wrong.  But they go for three rounds.  They tie each other up.  You try to tie a guy up in UFC or Pride and your arm is broken.  There's no break. 
[01:49:30]  There's no break at all.  You're just fighting for the entire time.  You know, we're watching the clip over here.  And this, it looks like a prison yard fight.  Yes.  It's a prison yard fight is what it is.  It's that, he clips him.  Chuck goes in for a body shot and gets tagged on his way back out.  He, like, gave him a body shot.  He's going back out.  And the guy just tags Chuck on the chin.  Spins his head around.  Chuck falls on the mat.  And then just proceeds to get his face punched in. 
[01:50:00]  It's painful to watch.  Was he an underdog?  Well, yes.  Well, Rampage, Chuck, I think, had lost to three different guys.  He had avenged two of the losses.  He had beaten two of the guys out of the three.  The one that he had to fight was this guy, Rampage Jackson, who had already beaten him.  And I don't know who was favored.  I want to say Liddell was still favored, even though this guy had beaten him.  But I actually had a bad feeling about it, just because the guy had nine years on.  That's a huge difference in any sport.  But when you're 37 and you're fighting a guy who's 28, I mean, that guy's in the prime of his career. 
[01:50:30]  Chuck is 37?  I thought he was younger.  No, I mean, he's 37 years old.  And the guy's name is Rampage.  Yeah, I know.  You've got to expect a lot of stuff.  A Rampage?  You're not expecting the rope-a-dope.  No.  Jimmy had a great observation, man.  Boxing is looking so ridiculously old at this point.  You just don't, because these guys are like, not that boxers are tough guys, but any one of these guys in an all-out fight would kill a boxer. 
[01:51:00]  Yep.  Because they've got the whole lower half of your body to attack.  And all the talent's going to UFC.  I mean, you know, if you're a tough dude, you're not going into boxing anymore.  The limelight is with the UFC.  And who wants to sit there, you get a pay-per-view of a boxing match, and it's two guys.  Sometimes it'll be exciting, but a lot of the times, a lot of those rounds are spent with the guys tired, and they're hugging each other, clinching.  The ref is breaking them up.  A few jabs thrown here and there. 
[01:51:30]  It gets boring.  These guys are just all out the whole time.  It's amazing to watch.  And their feet, the footwork they do is amazing.  Yeah, it's another thing.  You could be watching the guy's hands and doing your best to block that, and then a foot comes up and snails you on the side of the face.  Remember when UFC first hit and we all started kind of taking a peek?  It was so, like, what's the word?  Brutal?  Yeah, just brutal.  And they really figured out.  They realized they could go after boxing, and they've kind of made it into a really cool sport. 
[01:52:00]  At first, it was just an all-out, just...  At first, what you got were a lot of street guys.  These were just guys off the street, fat guys, guys that were in bar fights, and there were really no rules, and they didn't break that crap up.  And you'd get people just nailing someone in the face with their elbow until they were just bloodied, completely bloodied.  They kind of fixed that to make it a little more acceptable to the masses.  And it is blowing away boxing. 
[01:52:30]  Well, they also fixed it because they want to protect these guys to a point because, you know, they're becoming big names, you know?  Like, when we first started watching UFC, it was so primitive that guys that could have been huge stars were, like, in nursing homes, basically, after one fight.  So they're kind of protecting the guys to a point because they know they have markability, you know?  And there were also the fighters, like, guys that dominated back then, it seems.  Some of them are great, but a lot of them were street fighters, and they would be killed by guys that are fighting. 
[01:53:00]  And it seems like pride, and I'm not an expert on this, but I think Rampage Jackson was a pride fighter, and those guys, to me, are more professional.  Like, you know, Krokop was a pride fighter at Federal.  Like, those guys are, like, the best fighters in the world, and they're coming into UFC now.  So it's, like, becoming, like, a legitimate sport.  Yeah, huge.  I think much more fun to watch than boxing.  A lot more entertaining to watch.  They're more interesting guys than boxing.  I can't even tell you the last time I watched a boxing match, and I'm starting to even watch the UFC.  Yeah, brutal.  I got on board really late, but I'm really starting to get hooked on it a little bit now, too. 
[01:53:30]  And you really don't know, like, you don't know who's winning these things.  When they get in the ring, it could be this big guy.  I like this last match, though, with Rampage and Chuck Liddell.  You didn't know.  If this guy would have made one little mistake and Liddell would have gotten a fist in there, it could have gone the other way.  You just don't know.  None of them, I don't think, are undefeated.  I mean, I think Fedorov is, I think, undefeated.  I could be wrong.  But they're just, like, one mistake, you're finished.  You're done.  You can't tie a guy up here.  No.  You just can't listen to the ground. 
[01:54:00]  They'll throw you on the ground and just start, oof, pounding you.  So Liddell comes in Thursday.  Yeah, I hope so, man.  I mean, I love Liddell.  Right.  Hey, this guy's been waiting an hour.  Brett in New Jersey, ex-Marine.  Brett.  Hey, guys, what's up?  No such things as ex-Marines.  Yeah, that's true.  Hey, Brett, sorry to make you wait an hour, man.  That's no problem.  What do you got?  Am I on?  Yes, you are.  Oh, you're on, sir.  Oh, what's going on?  Hey, no, the hour was definitely worth the wait. 
[01:54:30]  I just want to, I'm a little off topic here, but there's always room to thank you guys for  supporting the troops here, man.  Always.  Yeah, absolutely.  I want to see more done for the guys over there.  I want to see more support.  I want to see less Iraqi government intervening into the whole thing and let the generals  do what they got to do.  If they want to send more guys over there, let's use the resources properly.  Let's use our air that we haven't been using. 
[01:55:00]  Clear these places out.  You know, don't send four guys out on a patrol where they're just going to get massacred.  Massive amounts of force.  More guys got to go out on these patrols and take care of business, and that's where  we're going to, you know, take control of this war and start winning the battle.  Martial law, curfews, and then clear these streets with some air power before some of  these patrols go out.  Definitely.  That's it.  I love it.  All right, Brett.  Thank you so much.  Hey, can I throw something else in before I punch out here? 
[01:55:30]  I just wanted to tell Jimmy as well.  He killed Nashville.  Oh, man.  Oh, thank you.  I'm still, I'm still on, I'm still trying to make it up to my girlfriend here.  She almost left me that night.  Wait till you see the HBO special you just filmed in DC over the weekend.  I'm sure it's a lot of the material you saw because that's what Jimmy was working out on  the road.  Yeah, Jimmy was so filthy.  I mean, she still can't believe I took her to that show. 
[01:56:00]  Well, my apologies.  Thanks for coming, buddy.  A bunch of people backstage saying Jimmy's material, even edgy for HBO.  Right.  And they were really happy you went there.  Yeah, we're still a little edgy.  Jimmy's people were really happy that you went as far as you did with your comedy.  So, all right, Brett, thank you.  I appreciate it, guys.  Take care.  Thank you, man.  We're going to take a quick break.  We get back to the girly magazines, the female playbook.  Danny did a pretty good job.  I think when we get back, we'll see what E-Rock picked out.  All right. 
[01:56:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  92.  E-Rock.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Jason, what's going on today?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, no, I just wanted to say, man, if you look at the paydays between boxing and UFC,  last fight, Chuck O'Dell got $450,000. 
[01:57:00]  Ray Page got $400,000.  Chuck O'Dell would have got another $500,000 if he would have won.  If you look at the last big boxing match, Oscar De La Hoya got almost $35 million.  Dude.  Boyd Mayweather Jr. took on 20 mil.  Oh, yeah, we understand that.  But what we're trying to say today is you get the feeling that the tide is changing  and more people would rather watch UFC than boxing.  It's growing.  I'm sure there's still more spectators watching boxing, but it's definitely changing is what  we're getting at.  Yeah, I agree with you.  It's just, yeah, De La Hoya fighting. 
[01:57:30]  I mean, boxing is always going to make a lot of money.  I mean, all of a sudden, like, boxing is just looking kind of like old, like out of place.  It's kind of like we talk about this from time to time.  You know, you go through your life doing the same thing over and over and over again.  And one day you wake up and you realize, wow, wow, stuff is changing.  Like, boxing looks old when you get to check out UFC stuff on the internet.  And then, like, just going to see a movie is starting to look kind of like old because  of the systems we all have now. 
[01:58:00]  You don't really need a lot of money to have a system that's comparable to a movie theater.  Oh, yeah.  Not a doubt, man.  But we're getting that feeling with boxing, I guess, is what we're trying to say today.  All right, man.  I can't wait to see you guys at PNC, man.  Oh, right on.  You know what?  How about you got your tickets?  I got some PNC bank tickets.  I would love to go to Jones Beach, too, man.  Oh, uh.  Oh, boy.  That didn't work out well.  The big ticket giveaway thing.  Yeah.  And the guy's got tickets.  And now he wants more. 
[01:58:30]  If you got tickets, I'm trying to give them to someone that doesn't have tickets yet.  I'm sorry.  All right, man.  That's cool, man.  Hey, I can't wait to see you guys.  Hold on.  I kind of screwed up.  What else we got?  We got, like, a prize closet of junk.  I'll give you something.  We'll give you junk.  All right, man.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Hold on the line.  I'll go back to you in a second.  Let's say hi to Chrissy.  Chrissy, what do you got for the show today?  How are you guys doing?  How are you?  We're doing good.  Good.  I wanted to let you guys know, I agreed with Brett.  I called in before.  I actually drove down to D.C. to see the show this past weekend. 
[01:59:00]  I'm from Jersey.  And I thought the show was great.  And it was edgy.  It was actually kind of funny.  I was sitting with my good friend, Carmella, that came to the show with me.  And I was pointing at all the girls who were giving their boyfriends dirty looks and nudging them during the show.  I didn't see much of that going on.  And I saw a crowd that was really into Jimmy on Saturday night.  What show did you go to, miss?  I was up at the Lincoln Theater show.  No.  What time? 
[01:59:30]  Time?  I was at the later one.  Oh, really?  The second show.  Yeah, at 10 o'clock.  Yeah, we were up in the top section, so.  Cool.  Yeah, Jimmy Kill.  We can't wait to see it on HBO.  I think it's in October.  Right.  Okay.  It was a great time.  Thank you.  I'm looking forward to seeing you guys.  I'm going to try and get my tickets for PNC sometime this week.  You know, people got to get their tickets, man.  What's going on with the ticket sales?  They're a little slow right now.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Have we been pushing it?  Well, we got a good deal going on for the Jones Beach show. 
[02:00:00]  What is it again?  Than's got the details.  And you can go to Virus Tour, one word on MySpace for all the info about our comedy tour this summer.  Four mezzanine tickets for $69.  Ooh.  That's for the June 16th show at Jones Beach.  You can get the tickets through Ticketmaster.  $69 for all four total.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a great, great deal going on, and we're going to get rid of that deal soon.  So gobble up those tickets for the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Got the village.  Got the tailgating.  It's an all-day event. 
[02:00:30]  All right, Chrissy.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  We will.  Bye.  All right.  Girly Magazine.  So who's next?  Yeah, who's next up?  We started this about an hour ago.  We had to stop because of Frank Vincent calling in.  But basically, we gave the guys a homework assignment to look at the female playbook.  The female playbook is all those magazines on the newsstands for women, like Cosmopolitan.  They give you little sex tips.  They just talk about dumb stuff.  Yeah, it's a bunch of girls sitting around trying to figure out what guys want or what 
[02:01:00]  guys should be doing, things like that.  And then they write it down in these magazines, and the women read it and think it's good information.  We found out from Danny that they don't know really what guys want.  Well, Danny was pretty good.  Sex tips from guys.  Yeah.  And it was basically guys telling girls what they can do to help out their sex lives.  And Travis brought this in. 
[02:01:30]  This is what he found a little interesting.  Oh, wow.  Travis, good subject.  Thank you.  This is, um, the sexiest things to do after sex.  Well, sleep.  This should be a much shorter article.  Get out and...  Leave.  Pay her.  Exactly. 
[02:02:00]  Pay her.  Get out.  Ah, prolong the pleasure of a steamy romp with these post-coital pleasures.  Yuck.  So after sex, you're supposed to be doing something, um, sexy.  This doesn't work.  Guys just want to crash.  It's not even just guys.  I'll tell you something.  It's in our chemistry.  After sex, we just want to sleep.  There...  I'm with the best girl ever, because she's the same way.  When we're done, it's just like, good night. 
[02:02:30]  Good night.  Or good morning, or whatever the hell it is, but it's back to sleep.  Just back to sleep.  That's because you're good.  That's because Aunt is a really good lay.  Oh, no.  Yes, it is, because my girlfriend afterwards wants to do jumping jacks and run around the  room doing funny voices.  She goes and finds a Pilates tape.  Yeah, she picks up a sock puppet and starts pretending, you know,  it's, all right, look, we're having a little show.  Wake up. 
[02:03:00]  She's like that snotty kid in six cents before her soup.  A little puppet show.  This proves that this is all crap that's out there for the women.  I mean, yeah.  If you're doing your job, the last thing you want to do is find other activities.  Right?  Yeah, that's pretty much the closer.  You're closing with sex.  That's it.  Thank you.  Good night.  Here's some tickets.  Make sure you keep them so you can leave. 
[02:03:30]  All right, well, here we go.  The sexiest things to do after sex, according to Cosmopolitan.  And girls are reading this thinking this is, you know, this is the Bible, basically.  They're going to start doing these immediately because it was in Cosmo.  It's Cosmo.  It's got to be true.  All right, go ahead there, Travis.  Well, yeah, pretty much what you guys were just saying, how men want to do nothing.  These are things that are supposed to short-circuit his snooze reflex and electrify his bod so you guys can keep being close after sex. 
[02:04:00]  But that means that the guys out there are dating or married to the wrong women, that they want things to happen after that.  After I'm done.  How about we take a nap and then we could do some cool stuff?  Right.  All right, well.  This is just annoying.  This is bothersome.  So this is what they're telling girls to do to the guy.  Right.  To keep him interested or awake or active.  We could take 100 phone calls.  You're going to get well over 90 of the guys saying the only thing they want to do is sleep after a good romp. 
[02:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  But the women are insisting that we have to do other stuff.  Why?  Well.  Who's writing this?  Let's hear what some of their suggestions are.  The first one is pay him a carnal compliment.  All right.  Guys are suckers for hearing about their sizzling sex skills.  So they're saying that if you talk about how good your man just was, he's going to want to stay up and hear all about it.  Oh, tell me more.  And that might lead to light conversation. 
[02:05:00]  How does she think that segues into her boring soap opera chit-chat?  After you tell me how good I am, shut up.  Soap opera chit-chat.  This whole article is how to keep your man awake after sex is what it comes down to, which is like you're just making him miserable.  Just let him sleep because it says your flattering feedback will keep him from dozing.  Yeah.  He's definitely going to stay awake for this performance assessment and kickstart light conversation, which you may be in the mood for right about now. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Here's what the guy says right before he falls asleep.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  I've made an ass of myself.  I do absolutely nothing around here.  Oh, wow.  That's terrible.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you. 
[02:06:00]  Here's what you want your girl to sound like.  Oh, God.  All right.  Well, what are some of the things?  Just keep your man awake after the thing.  Just go look it up.  We have to change the sheets.  There's been a problem.  I told you I didn't want to try that.  You insisted.  Now.  And now.  You're going to have to throw the mattress away.  Yes.  We have. 
[02:06:30]  Looks like someone dropped a fudgy the whale cake.  What is wrong with you?  Seriously, man.  All right.  Wow.  You compliment him and that keeps him awake.  Terrific.  That's the first one.  All right.  What's the next one?  Give him a massage.  Okay.  Yeah.  You could do that while I'm falling asleep.  That's perfect.  Sure.  But the massage is supposed to keep you awake?  Well, the massage is intended to eventually get him to reciprocate and. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Nobody.  They're telling women the wrong crap.  Wait.  So you have sex.  The guy.  All he wants to do is fall asleep.  Right.  She is now going to give him a massage because that'll keep him awake to the point where he's  going to reciprocate and give her massage.  Yep.  On what planet?  Not this one.  And they say, obviously, foreplay hotspots, such as, you know, those areas, are going to  be tender.  So that's the no-go zone. 
[02:07:30]  So they're saying massage everywhere except there.  Oh, my God.  That's what you want after a thing.  A shiatsu so you can reciprocate.  Right.  No, you just want to relax, fall asleep, lay on the couch, watch a movie.  That's fine.  Obviously, there's problems in this person's relationship that they're, like, trying to  get more going on after sex.  Absolutely.  If you have a very healthy relationship with a girl and you want to fall asleep after sex,  she probably wouldn't have a problem with that. 
[02:08:00]  You want to keep me awake after sex, get out of the room and send Ozzy in to talk to me.  That will work.  If Ozzy sits on the foot of my bed and chit-chats, I'll be right.  So how was it, Jimmy?  It was good, Oz.  It was fantastic.  Wonderful.  Or leave the bedroom.  Go find food somewhere.  Perhaps you should put your clothes back on, though, huh?  Maybe.  That would keep me up.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Michelle, what's up?  Hi.  Yeah.  Those magazines are trash.  If both of you are doing your job, you don't want anything else but sleep or get up and 
[02:08:30]  get out.  That's it.  Don't touch me.  I'm done.  It was great.  You know?  See?  There you go.  It's nice to know the women think like guys.  It's true, though.  When he's done with me, I'm done.  Could you imagine then giving a massage?  No.  Don't touch me.  Your arms are done.  You can't do anything.  And the guy's supposed to reciprocate.  You know, you're doing push-ups pretty much is what you're doing, trying to hold yourself 
[02:09:00]  up.  I agree.  It's trash.  It's trash.  The magazine's trash.  Ladies, get with the program.  I will never marry a woman that wants this stuff after sex.  That just means there's major problems in the relationship.  You want to keep me up after bed?  True.  Chew cinnamon toast crunch in my ear.  I love you guys.  I gotta go.  All right.  Thanks, Michelle.  Continue there, Travis.  All right.  The third one, which Cosmo says guys say is the most sexalicious thing a woman can do 
[02:09:30]  after getting busy, is take a shower together.  All right.  That proves that women are freaking writing this stuff and have no clue.  They have no, the last thing, you want to take a shower before, during, not after, not  after.  Do you really want to get up and like get into a freaking shower?  No.  It depends.  I mean, if I need it, look, look at the smirk.  All I'm saying is, this is going to be a doozy.  You may need one and I may not be able to reach where the banana is smeared. 
[02:10:00]  So I may have to have somebody help me.  Oh my God.  He got to help you out.  Absolutely.  Jimmy's already writing for his second HBO special.  You need a friend.  The old banana bit.  No, I want to shower much later.  I don't want to get up instantly.  I want to shower later so that when I go into the shower, I'm still ripping out leg hairs  because it's like crazy glue is in there.  Ow.  They just rip out leg hairs. 
[02:10:30]  What is that?  Ow.  This is why we're doing this bit because it's so ridiculous.  Guys don't want to massage.  They don't want to talk.  They don't want to take a shower with you or alone after sex.  You're saying that you want it to be like right after sex, all of a sudden, everything's  clean.  But if you doze off like that, even when you stand up, it looks like a slug dozed off on  a glue trap.  Yeah.  Something like that. 
[02:11:00]  And I'll tell you another thing.  Showering with a girl is great if you're showering as a foreplay thing to have sex.  I said before, during.  But that's like, that's not a shower.  That's an environment that you're in that's sexy, you're nude, you're touching each other.  If you're after sex showering, which is the cleanup shower, there's nothing unsexier  than doing the old, I just rode a horse bow-legged stance while you're scrubbing the dirty parts. 
[02:11:30]  That isn't sexy.  You got the washcloth.  You can't see half the washcloth because you're just trying to clean up.  Right in front of your woman, you're going for the old soap scoop.  Yeah, you don't want to.  That's not sexy.  A nice soapy scoop going with your hand.  You're just, you're doing that where you got to clean it off.  That's like your pine tar in a bat. 
[02:12:00]  That's kind of, it's not a sexy thing when you're washing off stuff.  Let's go to Jersey.  It's Ginny.  Ginny, what's up?  Hey guys, I've been married for 25 years and all I want to do later is sleep.  I don't want to massage.  I don't want to talk.  You know, even clean up.  If you want me to clean up, go grab a sock off the floor next to me and I'll take care  of it.  It's a box of tissues.  Tissues?  Just leave a couple of tissues.  No, you gotta use the wet knives.  Tissues sticking. 
[02:12:30]  Wet knives?  Yeah.  Tissues sticking, but it's funny.  That's good.  See?  They should put that in there.  Okay, use tissues to clean up immediately afterwards, because then you can both chuckle  it where the pieces stick.  Yeah.  Because have you ever had that happen to go, oh look, he looks like a Klansman.  Yes.  He's got to pull his little white cap off.  He cut himself shaving.  And not just because of the tissue, but because of the condition of the sheets. 
[02:13:00]  What is wrong with you?  That's great.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you.  You've got to use tissues, though.  That's why we're doing this bit, because it's obvious that this is all BS.  I never thought of that, Jimmy, because I use the, like, the moisturized wipes, because  now the toilet paper companies put them out, so it's not even like baby wipes anymore.  They're made specifically for adults to keep from getting cranky back there when you're  done.  But I've never thought of using those after sex, because that's pretty good, because 
[02:13:30]  the tissues, you're right, they do stick.  But you try that move sometimes to try to keep the bed from getting messy.  So you try, like, all right, if I put these here, I'll position the tissues, and now I'll  get ready to, Jesus Christ, I missed the whole thing.  It's all, oh my goodness gracious.  It looks like that delicious treat at Morton's that you dig into, the heated chocolate cake,  when you scoop the first one out, it all bubbles out. 
[02:14:00]  Then you have an ice cream and chocolate mess all over your plate.  Exactly.  I know cleaning that up.  And what guy's confident enough to actually be nude in a shower with their chick after  sex?  After, well, you better be ready to go, is what I'm saying.  You better, like, yeah.  Right, right, right.  But in general, nice warm water.  You wouldn't be putting that in a window display.  No, no, not right afterwards.  No, you don't.  Right afterwards, yeah, you're just standing there like, hi. 
[02:14:30]  It's like, oh, what are you, 10?  Right.  That is horrible.  A shower is an awful idea.  I have to say.  Stupid.  Looks like a pink good and plenty.  And this is how they describe it.  It's a no-brainer.  Any situation that has you hot, wet, nude, and invading his personal space is bound to  overpower his post-coital crash response.  Really?  No.  No.  Give it a, it's nappy time.  That's good.  And then we'll see what happens in 15, 20. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Half hour.  A little power snooze.  Snuggling under the shower stream.  Running your slippery, sudsy hands over his back.  And his, the heat-soaked environment not only keeps your bod super close, but it also actually  prolongs the post-orgasmic flush of you just finished booty session.  I hate the language that you use.  I'm trying to be cute and fun.  Booty session.  All right, listen, we're running out of show, so wrap up your article there, Travis, and 
[02:15:30]  we'll do more of this tomorrow with the rest of the guys, including Roland and E-Rock  and Steve.  Can't wait to hear Roland.  And Club Soda Kenny.  They all have to pick out one of these articles from one of these dumb magazines.  Go ahead, Travis.  Oh, the next one, I'm not really sure how to, uh, hmm.  Yeah.  You could say touch yourself.  You can run your hands over your body, of course.  Yeah, you can run your hands over your body.  A woman's, they say a woman is, uh, just to run your hands over her own body and seeing  that will make a guy want to join in or whatever. 
[02:16:00]  It doesn't, though, actually.  No, you're, you got rid of the poison.  You got to wait for it.  Poison.  You got to wait for the body to make more.  Poison, huh?  And that could be an hour.  It could be 15, 20 minutes.  Sure.  Whatever.  Whether he joins in or not, guys love to watch.  So it's a win-win situation.  God, this is all stuff that guys want before.  Yes.  If you see your girl doing this before and they talk about, oh, I can't say it, but then  it's going to make it that much better.  But to do all this stuff afterwards, you're like, no, I already did what I needed to do. 
[02:16:30]  You're like, how needy are you?  I like when I'm done to stand on my bed and put up a big mission accomplished banner behind  me and talk about how we just won.  Snuggling up.  Let's go to Joe on Massapequa.  Well, Joe, what's up?  Oh, shoot.  Hold on.  Joe?  Joe, Joe, Joe.  I lost him.  Joe's gone.  We'll never know what he had. 
[02:17:00]  Pat in the Bronx, what do you got?  Yeah, what's happening?  The best thing to do with the set is just leave.  Just leave.  Just leave.  My God.  You want tickets to Jones Beach, I hear, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Who cares about that?  All right.  You got a pair of tickets to see the Traveling Virus Comedy Show, June 16th at Jones Beach.  We got a real good deal going on right now.  Go to VirusTour, one word on MySpace for all the details.  But basically, you can get them through Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster.com.  Pat, hold on the line.  We're going to give you a pair of tickets, all right?  You're the best. 
[02:17:30]  Thanks, guys.  All right, brother.  If my girlfriend wants to keep me up after sex, all she has to do is start the car.  Yeah.  The snuggling thing, you know, that's...  Actually, if she can hear it running during the sex, it kind of is a hint as to what's  going to happen afterwards.  I just like keeping it warm.  Snuggling, falling asleep, that's fine.  The rest of them are like, please.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, thanks.  See you tomorrow.  See you mañana, as they say.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.
