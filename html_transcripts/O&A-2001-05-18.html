<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts and staff reeling from a night of heavy drinking at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Their office was described as a chaotic mess, littered with broken shot glasses, spilled alcohol (Jaegermeister, Sam Adams, Grey Goose), and even a basketball hoop obstructing their workspace.  The hosts recounted various drunken antics from the previous night, detailing a colleague's alcohol-soaked shirt and another's violent behavior.  Numerous intoxicated listeners and colleagues called in, contributing to the already inebriated atmosphere.  WWF wrestler Taz made a guest appearance, though even this segment was punctuated by the hosts' drunken antics and side conversations. A photo of their alcohol-saturated office was mentioned as evidence of their debauchery.  The show's drunken state continued throughout, even into the closing moments, with listener calls flooding in until the very end.

The broadcast then transitioned to a call from a 17-year-old listener, Kristen, who recited a poem expressing her infatuation with Ben. Ben responded with extreme negativity, insulting Kristen with terms like "filthy animal," "filthy whore," and "skank," and even urging her to "jump in front of a bus."  The exchange escalated into a profanity-laced argument involving other hosts, including Jim Norton, who was offered Kristen as a potential partner. Kristen also revealed that she had written stories detailing sexually explicit acts involving Ben and Norton.

Following this, the show shifted to a discussion of the Robert Blake murder case, featuring a guest appearance by Phil Schumann from *Extra*. O.J. Simpson's media involvement was also discussed.  Listener calls followed, some criticizing Ben's earlier behavior.  The conversation circled back to the hosts' alcohol consumption and the photos of their messy office. A call from Drudge Jr. added to the chaotic atmosphere, leading to further banter about the show's future and ratings.  An angry call from Mary, whose boyfriend falsely believed she was having an affair with Mark (a staff member), concluded this segment.  Benâ€™s drunken comments were blamed for this misunderstanding.


The next segment focused on the fallout from the Hard Rock Cafe incident, involving Mary, her boyfriend John (who was called live on-air), and "Stinky," who hosted after-hours parties in the office.  Mary's alleged actions at the Hard Rock (flashing people) were discussed, leading to a series of heated calls and arguments.  John confronted Mary about her "girls' night out" lie, culminating in a live on-air breakup.  Further calls from Mary's friend Kathy and others fueled the escalating drama.  George, recently laid off from the XFL, called to express sympathy with Opie and Anthony's own job insecurities. The segment concluded with a discussion about the hosts' contract negotiations and the state of their messy office.  A call with a DJ from another radio station and several unrelated calls followed. A previously recorded segment about a woman who could shoot eggs from her vagina was also briefly mentioned.

The final segment featured a caller, Jeff, who fell asleep during a planned phone proposal to his girlfriend.  The hosts and other callers made numerous attempts, with increasingly absurd methods, to wake him.  Billy Mac arrived in the studio intoxicated, further adding to the chaos.  Significant airtime was dedicated to advertising the WWF Judgment Day pay-per-view.  A nonsensical, angry outburst from a listener named Steve followed. The closing segment included discussion of a Boston trip, anecdotes about misadventures, more bizarre behavior from Mark, and further promotional spots.  The show concluded with a graphic advertisement for "Ultimate V," a male enhancement product.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Eight minutes of pure adrenaline. It's Ben.  W. Ben E. W. now concludes its broadcast day.  Stay tuned for W. O. N. A. on 1027 W. N. E. W.  Everybody's talking about the O. P. N. A.  We don't care. She's talking.  I know I'm a loser.  You're a jerk-off.  A douche.  You effin' tall. 
[00:00:30]  I'm a tool.  I'm a dumb twat.  Okay, pathetic.  Someone just shoot me in the head.  O. P. N. A.  O. P. N. A.  O. P. N. A.  O. P. N. A.  O. P. N. A.  This was your appointment.  Back to you. 
[00:01:00]  Okay.  Hey, everyone, it's your good pal, Phil McCracken.  Boy, I got a rock-hard one here in my back because I'm dabbling myself.  You're a rich man, huh?  I'll bang anything with a hole.  Opian Anthony.  Hey, let's go touch some children.  Okay, terrific. Thank you.  One-O-T-E-V-A-N-D-A-N. 
[00:01:30]  Marijuana is the bomb.  This is Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Yes.  I hate this place.  No places don't work.  Nothing else can.  I've been here for seven years.  Oh, Billy.  I need to get a replacement. 
[00:02:00]  Paralyze is an archite, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good and does everybody a lot of harm.  Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.  Who did this thing?  Who did this thing?  Wow, I hit a thread.  Oh, I.  Oh, I.  Hey, you get your big ass back in the kitchen.  That makes me some fun. 
[00:02:30]  Hey, you ain't that.  I never go to England.  Let's go while we're young.  She was a whore.  You're happy and you know it, say it's where.  Boom.  Hi, me.  Woo-hoo.  Hey, who's the stripper?  This place blows.  I'm in the gold movie.  I hate you playing.  Time to be bad.  This is where the park had previously indicated. 
[00:03:00]  Sweet, magical crab.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  What the hell were you thinking?  I think it's time for you to start to seriously consider foul.  You know what I'm talking about.  Ah, you got that right.  The O&A Show.  It's FU Friday, 212-757-1027.  Nice.  How's everyone doing today?  Very well. 
[00:03:30]  Very well.  Nice.  This was last night's festivities.  Yeah, I guess we could start with that.  I want to say hi to everyone.  We met at the Hard Rock Cafe last night.  My God, man.  Just another mess of a night.  You know, I don't know who started this trend, but there seems to be a trend now going on  that wasn't happening at previous appearances, and it's in the form of a small glass holds  about an ounce of liquid, and it gets passed around, and people drink them. 
[00:04:00]  You're talking about shots.  Shots.  Where did this come from?  Where did this come from?  Now, everyone gets snotted to the point where now people aren't remembering the previous  night.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  I discovered last night that I worked with a bunch of alcoholics.  It starts with a goddamn Jaeger machine in the office.  It starts with shots of Jaeger in the office, CC.  Get Steve C. in here. 
[00:04:30]  I think we all have to admit today that we have a serious problem on our hands with this  radio show.  We have a Jaegermeister shot machine in the office.  Do you see them at the bars?  They have the three bottles that are turned upside down into this big refrigerating machine,  and you push the button.  Usually, it's behind a bar, and you push the button, and an ice-cold Jaegermeister comes  out.  We have shot glasses.  We have boxes of shot glasses in the office.  They get broken open, shot glasses get poured around, and people go behind the door where 
[00:05:00]  the machine is, and press the button, and start drinking ice-cold Jaeger right after the  show, knowing we have something to do with the hard drive.  And let me tell you something.  I think we need to sign a contract, because we need someone to babysit us.  Yeah.  Now we're just, we're flying by the seat of our pants.  We're out of control.  We know we can do whatever the hell we want, because, you know.  We're like spoiled children.  Yeah, they don't want to piss us off.  Right.  So now we got, like, a shop machine in the office.  Today, we're like that Twilight Zone where little Anthony, remember? 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Billy Moomy.  And they had to do everything he said, or they sent him to the cornfield.  That's exactly what this show is now.  It's Frozen Jaegermeister shots.  Who has that?  Greatest invention.  Even Scott Muni had to hide his bottle in the desk.  We just got a delivery of more cases of Sam Adams than I ever saw in my life.  Eight cases.  Eight cases of Sam is now in the office right near the Jaeger machine. 
[00:06:00]  There's bottles of Grey Goose vodka that you trip over when you walk in the door.  It's getting ridiculous, and I'm a drunk.  And I'm saying it.  What the hell is going on?  Our office is just, wow, it looks like a disaster.  It's a bar.  I'm reading the Motley Crue autobiography.  We're getting there.  Our office is worse than the house that the gang from Motley Crue first lived in when they first got together.  It's just a matter of time before we start seeing roaches in that place. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I swear to God, with all the food that we're spilling all over the joint.  Food?  We have time to eat between the drinking.  Ridiculous.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, O?  Hey.  You know, I'll tell you something.  Steve last night was suited.  His shirt had more alcohol on it than I drank the entire night.  It would have went up like a torch if he dropped a match on his shirt.  It was saturated with Jaeger and all types of dark green stuff he was drinking.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah, right on, Paul. 
[00:07:00]  Later.  Thanks, Paul.  Vague recollection.  The funny thing is, I got to tell everyone what Steve said to me.  He walked up to me and he goes, well, I got to get out of here because my girlfriend doesn't want me coming home drunk and stuff.  Too late.  But then he goes, and I really, really want another beer.  I have no recollection of this ever-taking place.  So being the pal I am, I'm like, well, Steve, do you want to go home not drunk? 
[00:07:30]  Well, how many have you had?  He goes, I don't know.  Three or four beers in at least five or six shots.  Yeah.  I go, Steve, you should go get that another beer because I don't think it's really going to matter.  Does it matter?  He goes, the point where it's not.  No.  He goes, okay.  He walks back to the bar and grabs another beer.  He asked me today, just before in the office, he goes, what was in those PB&J shots?  I go, alcohol.  What does it matter?  They tasted really good.  I've never had that before.  Yeah.  Wow.  They go down smooth. 
[00:08:00]  Yes, they do.  He was looking for the friend to come to the bar with you.  You're like, come to the bar with me.  I need a friend to go to the bar.  Not that I'm in anyone.  Hey, man, what's up, man?  He goes, not that I'm in anyone to effing talk, but he didn't say effing.  He just used to effing.  I really don't know what the hell happened.  I'm still drunk.  I don't know what that's going on.  The whole friggin' Opie and Anthony organization is zooted.  It really is a disaster. 
[00:08:30]  We need a counselor.  Before we even packed everything up and got back to the office, Steve was on his third shot.  What are you talking about?  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Oh, the Jaeger inside.  Yeah, you had Jaeger before you even hit the heart.  The fourth shot.  I had to get primed.  And I'm not saying anything because I was pushing the button on the machine myself.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you, sir.  I actually have to leave you here a little piece of information now.  When do you hear things like this in an office building?  Steve, where are the shot glasses? 
[00:09:00]  Steve, where are the shot glasses?  Oh, and the answer?  They're right here.  And he gets them.  He breaks open the box.  And they're Jaeger shot glasses.  To take over to the Jaeger machine.  You know what we should do because people think we're full of ass?  We should take some digital pictures of our office.  It's ridiculous.  It's a bar.  Just as is.  Don't even set anything up because you can take pictures of bottles of booze.  The Jaeger machine.  The cases of beer.  The food refrigerator that had to be empty of food so the beer could fit because the beer  fridge is full. 
[00:09:30]  They're both beer fridges.  Who can know?  And we're all so drunk that not one of us can do an intervention.  Like there's not even one sensible guy that will step forward and go, God.  Oh, okay.  Now it's fine.  But instead, the Sam Adams arrives at our office and everyone starts clapping.  Yeah.  Like what took you so long?  John comes in with a hand truck of Sam Adams.  We're all talking about how told everyone was and how we all have a problem.  And we cheer when he wheels in the fan.  It's a lost cause.  I have a comment here. 
[00:10:00]  Yes, Ben?  Not that anything matters at this point.  But last night, before we left, before I got trapped, I took a serious phone call from  like a serious, it was like a serious like family thing.  And then there's a dude like, whoo!  Jaeger myself!  I'm like, the person's like, what the hell is going on?  I'm like, I'm in my office.  Horrified.  In the office.  I'm like, that's your, she's like, that's your office.  I'm like, I'm sorry.  I defy you to call any other office and hear what goes on in our office. 
[00:10:30]  That's bad.  It's ridiculous.  It's like a dorm room, for God's sake.  There's movie posters hanging up, naked girl pictures, and booze.  All we need is the big spool from the electric companies for a table and some milk crates to  use as bookshelves.  To put our stereo on it.  To put the stereo on it and the shag carpet.  Right.  It's ridiculous.  So it was, it was a lot of fun last night.  Yeah.  It really was.  I just want to say hi to everyone we met, including the spaceman.  Yeah, the spaceman. 
[00:11:00]  The spaceman who looked like George Carlin and the guy who looked like Ace Frehley without  his makeup on.  And he was flattered by that compliment.  Ace Frehley.  I was getting other things from people.  First of all, he's got to remember to shoe black the roots, too.  Because I swear to God, it looked like Pepe Le Pew was laying down on his head.  He had like the skunk head going.  He had this big gray strip going down the middle of his head and the black hair, like  shoe black hair, like Ronald Reagan black hair. 
[00:11:30]  He looked just like Ace without the makeup.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, he did.  We tried to set him up with Stalker Patty and he was really into it.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty there, of course.  Jesus.  I don't remember him.  Go to Frank.  Looks like he didn't.  212-757-1027.  Frank, what's going on?  I'm downstairs with the eight balls and the suitcase full of H. I just wanted to know  where I should drop it off.  Just bring it upstairs.  We'll all cheer when you're walking with narcotics. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  I'll be right up.  That's about all we need right now.  That and some sexually transmitted diseases and we're rock stars.  Harry.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I'm listening via Underground from Florida.  Nice.  We want to welcome Florida to the Syndication Underground family.  Is Steve in the studio there with you?  Steve's thing?  Yeah.  I'm the one who sent Steve the clip of that other show ripping off you guys.  They're using some of your bits down here.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  What, they're actually playing on stuff?  No, there's another show that's in Florida. 
[00:12:30]  I'm not sure where in Florida.  They're doing What Did We Learn?  at the show, I think.  I'm not really sure.  Yeah, they're down somewhere in Orlando.  Well, if it's an educational show, who are we to sing?  It's Nine Rednecks.  That's all it is.  Is that the name of the show?  Rednecks, buddy!  No, they're called Monsters of the Midday.  Monsters of the Midday?  Yeah.  What bits are they doing?  They're doing, at the end of their show now, What Did We Learn?  Yeah, that's a great bit.  Well, whatever.  The whole, you're ripping me off thing is getting old, so what can we say? 
[00:13:00]  Just a little spent and ragged around the edges.  All right, just keeping tabs on it, letting you guys know.  Thank you.  And listening via Chuck Radio.  Chuck Radio rocks!  Good deal.  Florida.  Look at that.  We're all over the country, Ophie.  All over the world via computers.  Yeah, two people here, two people there.  Brian, what's going on?  Yo, ONA.  Hey.  Yeah, I work for an automotive factory, and we definitely drink more than you guys while 
[00:13:30]  we're building your cars and trucks, no doubt.  I would beg to differ.  I can't see how anyone could drink more.  Well, I'll tell you.  How do you drink more when we're constantly drinking?  We have some heavy hitters, man.  You haven't seen anything until you've seen Jake go at it, Steve go at it, and on a good day.  I'll tell you, I'm going into work now.  I start at 4.30.  I'm starting it off with some ball hits, you know, how that goes.  Hey, Brian.  Yeah.  Let me ask you this. 
[00:14:00]  What's up?  Are you still drunk right now?  Uh, no.  I don't know.  I'm hanging up on it because we got your beat there.  Look at Ben.  Oh, I am.  Look at Ben.  Ben, you need a shower or something.  And then Ben disappeared for a while today.  Like, he was in really bad shape.  He disappeared.  We didn't even know where he went for hours.  Like, he had to go home.  We're thinking he had to go home.  No, he just admitted it, so now he can say it.  I went and had a couple drinks.  I didn't even know what the hell to do with myself.  Hair of the dog that bit me, Lloyd. 
[00:14:30]  I do not know what the hell happened.  He called me this morning around 7.30.  And I go, Ben, what time do you get home?  He goes, at least 5.  I'm like, why aren't you sleeping right now?  Oh, it's a sad, sad state of affairs going on here.  And like Opie said, we need supervision.  And then I went into the office, and Ben's there.  And all of a sudden, he just goes, I got to get out of here.  I'm like, Ben, I just started to work.  I went to the bar.  I'm like, I need a frigging drink.  You really don't know what the hell happened. 
[00:15:00]  All I remember is loud music at 4.30 in the morning  and a neighbor banging on someone's door.  I'm like, what the hell is going on?  Oh, my God.  It's just ugly.  It's a disgusting bunch of delinquency.  It really is.  It really is.  I'm going to come out and say this, because I'm still drunk.  He, Steve, was out of his frigging mind line.  He was ready to kill anyone.  It was great.  I was dying for a stand-up fight.  Steve would have killed anyone in sight.  You know what it is, though?  He's a soft-spoken, nasty drunk. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, Steve.  He's saying to me, I go to the table he's sitting at.  He says to me, he goes, Anthony?  I'm like, yeah, Steve.  And he seems like he's not drunk, because he's talking so low.  He goes, I just want to kick the living S out of some M or F-er.  I'm like, Steve, you okay?  I'm so effing drunk.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Thanks for telling me.  When did I say that?  Constantly.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were so, like, belligerent.  But not the loud Ben belligerent drunk. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, shut up.  He was trying to kill someone.  I was like, I want a fight.  I just want to see Steve kill someone.  And Ope had to talk him out of it.  He wanted to kill somebody.  Did you hear what he said about Nick from Penthouse?  No.  That I honestly remember.  I honestly remember being really drunk and telling Nick from Penthouse that I thought he was really phony when I first met him.  That's good.  But that's the guy that gave us a pretty good break in our career.  No, he's a very cool guy.  Clarify that. 
[00:16:30]  See, we'll never learn.  He's another one.  Nick from Penthouse that was out of control.  Do you want to know what's funny, too?  Freaking Steve this morning.  No recollection.  I'm like, dude, you want to kill me?  I was like, really?  Yeah, he didn't get to.  You're like going around telling people you knock their head off.  I did.  It was great.  I'm glad I could be entertaining.  Unbelievable.  What a collection.  What a cast of characters.  Stinky.  Woo!  Yeah.  Now, Stinky was kind of under control last night. 
[00:17:00]  Relatively speaking.  He was fine.  Based on the curve.  Based on the curve.  He was fine.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I have a question for you.  Yeah.  Back in the office, did they use your desk opium as a bar?  You just set up stools all along it because it's so big?  The huge desk?  The huge desk.  The bar.  Everyone has their individual little drinking spots.  He's got to cut a hole in the middle of his desk and put the tap right there.  Now, with the basketball hoop up, it's hard because the ball bounces off the backstop  and everyone's got to grab their drinks or they get knocked over.  Yeah, we've got a full court basketball in our office. 
[00:17:30]  It's basketball being played in the office.  It's not like, hey, you know, let's shoot a few.  It's an all-out game.  Ridiculous.  We really need some supervision.  Freaking Ant sits at his computer with his hand over his face so it doesn't get nailed on the rebound.  Oh, I've been smacked in the head.  I'm trying to do something on the computer.  The basketball just hits my keyboard and screws up what I'm working on.  You know the other thing that we should bring up?  Someone is having after-hours parties in our office on the weekend.  Uh-huh.  Somebody is having after-hours parties. 
[00:18:00]  We've got to get to the bottom of that.  Name me.  We've got to get to the bottom of that.  I come in, and just the other day I checked the history on my computer  and saw all the sites that were being visited.  Now, look, I know the porn sites I've been to,  but there are certain porn sites I have never been to.  And I'm looking, all right, who's using my computer?  I come in today, there's some kind of graphics program on there  with stinking on it or something.  And then there's people in, like, the office. 
[00:18:30]  You can tell.  There's beers on my...  Now, I make sure I take all the beers off my desk when I leave  and throw them away.  Then I come in the other day, there's beer spilt on my keyboard.  My mouse pad is a sponge.  And Rick goes, oh, a beer spilt when the ball hit.  And I'm like, wait, I throw all my beers away.  We're still talking about our office people.  But, yeah, there's people having after-hours parties.  Yeah, what about the big black stains now?  There's a lot of stains on the rug.  Like, they just showed up.  Yeah.  My computer screen was taped. 
[00:19:00]  There was beer.  It looked like someone took a beer and threw it against the wall.  And it went all over Rick's computer and all over the wall.  Christina.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I work in an office that used to be the world headquarters for a beer company.  And when they moved out, they left their bar and all the taps.  And it's always fully stocked.  We go in.  We have working lunches.  It's incredible.  There's couches in there.  People pass out to the couches. 
[00:19:30]  There you go.  We're all a bunch of alcoholics now because of where we work.  Just like here.  Thank you, Christina.  Thank you.  I'm sorry to talk a lot today, but why would you have an after hours in our office?  I don't know.  We don't know.  They're like somebody coming in.  There's a lot.  Someone has a key to our office.  I love Ben's head.  Look at his head.  Ben, I'm real.  You've got to put some water in your hair.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  I don't know what happened. 
[00:20:00]  You called me right after you, dude.  All I get is, I ran.  I had no voice.  I had two hours of sleep.  I'm going.  No drunken phone calls to anybody?  You know what?  I've stopped doing that.  I know how incriminating they're going to be.  Because now people are ready and they're going to tape them and we'll get them.  But however, Mark, being the little pussy that he is, threatened to never be my friend again.  Threatened to never be your friend again.  Maybe Mark, my good friend of many years, threatened to never be my friend again. 
[00:20:30]  Why?  I don't know.  Do you remember what the hell?  What's Mark's problem with Dave?  He threatened to never talk to me again last night.  He's my friend.  Oh, he's also got a problem with Stinky.  No, because what?  I'm hammered.  I don't know.  No, because his girlfriend was there and we made believe that she was wowing the whole place.  And then we called Mark to tell him.  And we left a message on his voicemail.  And he was kind of pissed at that.  And then Stinky got her high. 
[00:21:00]  You're painful, man.  All right, look.  We've got to move on with the radio show today.  Jesus Christ.  They really have nice boobs.  They really are nice.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that's his girl, man.  He can't take a joke anymore.  I know.  He's like a pussy.  You don't mess with someone's girl.  Jesus, man.  That's like an unwritten rule.  Dude, shut the hell up.  You were the one that completely yesterday this whole thing last night. 
[00:21:30]  As much as I love to F with Mark, Opie was completely behind it.  Well, because I didn't have a phone and I figured he needed to know.  So you called up Mark?  Yeah.  Guilty.  What?  I'm so glad I leave sometimes.  I did have to apologize to him and he accepted my apology, but he still pissed at Finn.  I'm so glad I leave sometimes and just get myself out of the situation before it gets completely out of control. 
[00:22:00]  We should tell people it was an early night for most of us.  Yeah.  Because we had things to do today.  Ben was the one that kept going.  I got home last night and it seemed like a good idea to get a pizza and eat like six slices to the point where I just grabbed the crust of the last slice and threw it in the box.  Your mouth is still full and go, I can't even eat another effing bite.  You know, you have trouble swallowing the lads.  And then, even better, right after I did that, what did I do? 
[00:22:30]  Went right to bed.  I woke up today, it was like a salad shooter.  Oh, you ever see the salad shooter commercial, infomercial?  You put in lettuce and stuff and you pull the trigger and it just comes.  It was like this, I swear.  Where you're like, oh, geez.  Oh, dude, you got to do valve control.  You're like, you're working the exit like a valve. 
[00:23:00]  The muscles are like, well, all right, give it a little, give it a little.  All right, pull back, pull back.  Pull back.  My frigging liver is going to come out if I don't.  You know, you know those days?  It looks like you rode your 10-speed bike through a mud puddle.  That's it.  Back here shared a mess.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God, the toilet water had to look like the scene in Perfect Storm.  What am I going to say?  That's what happened.  Shots and a pizza.  Yeah, that's really what I needed. 
[00:23:30]  A whole pizza.  Ass.  Toilet bowl looked like a small town after a flood went through it.  A mud slide.  Mud slide.  All right, we got to take a break.  God, what a mess we are.  Yeah, I had a meetup with Ann first thing this morning, and the first words out of his mouth,  and I've known you for a long time, my friend, first words out of his mouth this morning were,  dude, I need to dump.  You were still dumping it.  It was a mess. 
[00:24:00]  I'm like, yeah, you sure can't hold it?  It was so utterly bad.  And I had to wait.  I hate that.  I had to wait.  I'm stuck in traffic, and I'm like, oh.  And when you're stuck in traffic, and then I know I've got to get to 57th and 7th,  so I'm on the West Side Highway at 57th, and your body knows you're closed.  I'm like, all right, don't even think.  And I'm saying this out loud.  Don't even think about it.  Don't think about it yet, because 57th's a bitch.  It's going to take a while.  Anthony, how about this one? 
[00:24:30]  Dumb sweats.  Forget about it.  Anthony, how about this one?  Uh-oh.  I hope this is a fart.  Oh, no.  No, I couldn't even do it at that point.  You ever have to take, sometimes you take that shit.  You ever have to, no.  No.  Opie, I couldn't.  You ever sit down, you ever sit in your seat, and have to take both hands and tuck your cheeks in,  so it's just like, all right, let me get, I'll use the friction of the seat to hold it together.  Just hold it a little while longer.  Oh, brother.  And then you do the wacky walk, you're doing everything. 
[00:25:00]  I'm sweating like I got a fever, sweating like I'm a malaria victim.  That's funny.  What a mess.  Well, we have to take our first break.  Is that Sam Adams cold yet?  I was thinking maybe.  Immediately.  Oh, what a mess.  Okay.  We have problems.  Problems!  All right, Ben.  Calm down.  I can tell he's still belligerent. 
[00:25:30]  I know.  Dude, I'm trying to do a radio show.  He's right next to my ear.  Shut up, the radio.  Two hours of sleep.  I can't help you, man.  You're getting me nervous, though.  Hey, Taz, what's up?  We have to take a break, and we're going to talk to you next.  We don't have a lot of time.  What do you mean we don't have a lot of time?  Oh, that's right.  You're throwing out the first ball.  Well, let me, we have to take a very quick break.  We have Taz from the WWF.  We'll talk to him next, okay?  Okay.  It's OSA, and it's Taz from the WWF. 
[00:26:00]  He's got to get out of here in a few minutes.  So maybe we should just cut into the commercials and hang a little longer with him.  I mean, we've got to do a live read.  A guy just gave me half a cup of milk.  That's half of it.  Well, I asked for milk for the coffee, and he gave me half a cup.  Where is he?  There he is.  What's your name?  That's John.  That's John the stalker.  Good job.  Is this scam or low-fat? 
[00:26:30]  Cold.  Cold?  Cold.  Cold.  Yeah.  Great.  John can tell you anything about you, you know.  He's really thrilled.  Give us a Taz fact.  Something that the average person doesn't know, John.  All right.  Used to be an ECW.  Duh.  Where are you from, John?  Jersey.  Did you curse?  You didn't say, oh, S.  No, I did not say that.  I said, shh.  All right, John.  Nine minutes.  Nine minutes. 
[00:27:00]  John, great job once again.  Thank you.  Oh, what a beauty.  Hey, Anthony, on WNEW.com, if you go to Opie and Anthony,  Scott Colombo just put a picture of the corner of our office,  just in case you thought we were BSing before.  There's the JÃ¤germeister shot machine.  The shot machine.  The cases of Sam.  Now, this wasn't set up.  He just shut the door and snapped this picture.  There's two, four, six cases of Sam Adams that you can see.  You see right to the right of the foosball table? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, that's the foosball table that we haven't set up yet.  There's our basketball hoop.  You can see the beer refrigerator to the right of the foosball table.  It's on top of the food refrigerator, which is full of beer.  Right.  So there's a problem.  These guys take a picture of all the bottles behind the TV, too.  Thank you.  Let them know that, okay?  Take your time.  Let's talk about boxes of liquor.  Right.  There's nothing to promote.  Right.  I came here and sat in traffic and talked about boxes of liquor.  And just for the record, you guys look really salty today.  Salty is a good word. 
[00:28:00]  Very salty.  Salty.  Ben is still drunk.  He is.  He's still drunk.  He looks it.  Where's this?  What's this?  Ben?  Ben.  How you doing, Ben?  Yeah, what's up?  Right.  All right, listen.  We've got to get through a live read real quick, and then we'll get right to Pinnacle  Monkeying Around.  Yeah, the people at Pinnacle brought you Pinnacle Hornigol.  Of course, now they have Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Ben, you can't go.  Sit down.  No, you've got to hang, Ben.  I need someone to drink with.  All right.  Fan the flames of passion naturally with a potent blend of all natural exotic herbs, 
[00:28:30]  including the legendary monkey Taekwong Yin.  Yes, monkey Taekwong Yin.  Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  It's the exciting herbal spark.  It's going to reignite the passion in your life.  It's from that Fukin province of China.  It's from Fukin province.  Jesus Taekwong.  Come on.  They spend a lot of money.  China's Fukin province.  That's where our spy plane was flying over to.  That's like when you're driving, a guy cuts you off.  You go, that Fukin guy.  Right.  From the Fukin province.  That's what I'm saying. 
[00:29:00]  If it's an Asian guy driving, you assume he's from the Fukin province.  You go, look at this Fukin guy.  Well, if it's an Asian guy driving, you get away.  You know the deal on that.  Absolutely.  That's the truth.  Remember this.  The three Ps, pleasure, passion, and Pinnacle, Opie.  They're missing a couple Ps in there.  They're talking about sex.  Ah, poofah.  Pinnacle Monkeying Around, available at GNC and other fine health food stores.  I'll call them up.  1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323.  When it's time to get funky, what do you do?  What do you do?  Reach for the monkey.  Thank you, Opie. 
[00:29:30]  You don't want to be here, Tess?  No, I'm here.  You're sighing and stuff.  No, I'm good.  I'm good.  You guys actually have a really good espresso machine.  You're talking about liquor.  I'm talking about coffee.  And I had a great beer machine.  I'm digging a triple shot.  Yeah, it's gotten us through a couple of days.  And we got some Sambuca, if you want to add.  You want some Sambuca?  We'll put that in there.  No, no.  Actually, I have my wife and my son's in a limo downstairs.  I want to let my wife know she's listening to the show, and I'm going to bring her down a coffee.  Because she'd get mad at me if I'd, you know, drink a coffee.  The espresso rocks.  That's a novel thing.  He's not drinking, and he's not trying.  Wow. 
[00:30:00]  Figure that one out.  Gotta try that sometime.  So, Todd, you're so funny, Ben.  All of a sudden, I'm like the funny guy.  You're going to laugh at me now?  Leave me alone.  I don't know what I'm laughing at.  Oh, so you're like a drunk, miserable, like nerdy guy.  No, I'm having a great time.  I just, you know, whatever.  It's fun, you know?  Yeah.  He had two hours sleep, Todd.  Yeah.  He's gentle.  I'm good.  I'm good.  He doesn't know.  He keeps giving me these dirty looks.  I don't like the look at you.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:30:30]  I didn't say anything.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  I didn't say anything.  Holy smoke.  This is going to get ugly, Ted.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Can we talk to Taz for a little while, Ben?  Of course.  All right.  I'm good.  Whatever you want.  Your show.  Oh, my God.  Is he belligerent?  He's in the back.  Is he effing belligerent?  He's mad at you guys about something.  No, he just gets like that when he gets a little ham and he gets really, he's a nasty drunk.  All right.  That's cool.  That's cool.  No, he's not.  What the fuck? 
[00:31:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Let me put your mic back up.  I really should have gotten more of this.  Yeah.  I'm just bombed.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  I think I should go smoke some weed.  I don't know.  Taz, are you sure you want to be on the show with your wife tonight?  No, that's all right.  We'll have a couple of beers later.  All right.  Listen, Taz is going out the first pitch tonight?  Yes.  That's right.  Is it going to be a rain out, though?  No, don't worry about the rain.  It'll be right.  You got a Mets to play in the Brooklyn Dodgers and I'll be there.  Brooklyn Dodgers.  Someone told me that they left Brooklyn.  Yeah.  A little while ago, I think. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  I think.  I'm not sure.  Why?  Why?  Did they leave Brooklyn?  I just found out.  John Walker right here from our company just Taz.  They don't have a stadium anymore.  It's like an apartment complex.  Right.  Poured down Ebbets Field?  Yeah.  Pretty tough to play baseball on a stairwell.  I was just doing it as a kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hate you.  What do you got to get licked at, bro?  It's the swamp lid.  I hate you.  I just was curious.  I thought we were going to get along this time.  Where's Gary Coleman?  That little bat kid.  Where is he? 
[00:32:00]  Remember he was on hold forever?  Yeah.  You were here for the famous Gary Coleman on hold.  He was on hold forever.  You need help.  You don't look good.  Yeah.  We're having fun, though.  We're okay.  We're having fun.  Right, Taz?  Now, what's going on Sunday?  Sunday's Judgment Day.  Judgment Day.  It's a pay-per-view, WWF.  Ray knows we kick ass on pay-per-view.  So we've got a huge show.  And I know you guys are paying attention to what's going on with the big main event, Triple  H.  Not my bad.  Stone Cold.  Stone Cold.  defending WWF title against The Undertaker.  Yes.  So it's going to be heavy duty. 
[00:32:30]  And then Triple H is facing Kane in a chain match.  Nice.  A chain match.  A lot of violence.  A lot of violence is going to be brutal.  Nice.  Yes.  We like that.  We all know The Undertaker's not going to win, though.  How do you know that?  Because that's how the WWF works.  One guy has to keep the title for about two and a half years, and then he'll finally give  it up.  Wait, that would mean that everything's planned.  Yeah.  Well, that's not the case.  I mean, I'll tell you this.  You're the first one that's even tried this in quite a while.  You know, I've always said the only time wrestling's fake is when I lose. 
[00:33:00]  Right.  Yes.  But, I mean, yeah, no, it, Chip, The Undertaker could win this matchup.  Ain't no doubt about it.  You're fired!  Why?  What happened?  You guys know what that's saying.  Yeah, we know what that's saying.  Hey, shut up, man.  No, because we're officially going to get fired from the XFL.  But listen, I got to tell you, the day, no, the day, no, the day, no, I'm serious.  Now, the day I was on the show, that happened.  You guys, your word.  And I was listening to your show, and I was like, wow, that's not cool. 
[00:33:30]  I was, I was pissed off, you guys.  That really was.  No.  Well, thank God we got off the plane before it hit the ground.  Of course, we hit the ground, too, but we just weren't in the aircraft.  What do you mean the plane hit the ground?  You know, it's kind of an analogy I'm making.  The XFL, if it was an airplane test and it's crashing, we jumped out.  See, but we plummeted to the ground also.  But we did not, we were not in the aircraft that was the XFL.  We got out early because we saw it coming.  Yeah, sure.  Why did they put O.J. Simpson on the sidelines? 
[00:34:00]  Like, that would have boosted ratings.  That would have been good.  Forget about it.  If you knew O.J. was going to be there with the gloves and the Bruno Mali shoes on the sidelines,  now let's talk about the season.  The hitman happened.  You know, it's like, what?  I tune in every week to see this son of a bitch.  That would be.  Vince should have, he should have done it.  You know O.J. would have taken the job.  Did you pitch that idea to Vince?  I did.  He did.  I did.  I was like, well, we'll look into that.  I don't think we're going to actually go in that direction. 
[00:34:30]  I'm like, no, no, no, Vince.  You've got to do this.  Hire the killer.  You pitched it to him when we were interviewing him for our pregame show that he denied that  he knew anything about.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I heard O.J. likes, he hates me.  A lot.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I could sympathize because everyone hates me.  Right.  I'm here on the field looking for Nicole's real killers.  I think it's part of the L.A. extreme.  Look, I still remember the team, though.  Unlike 99% of the country. 
[00:35:00]  Chicago enforcers, yeah.  Remember we had a study up on the team?  Memphis maniac, I'm the L.A. maniac.  You guys had a study up on the team?  San Francisco demons.  Yes.  Look at that.  Who cares about the XFL?  What else can we go down with the pay-per-view?  We've got the medals match, two out of three falls.  Kurt Angle and, you can look at the card if you want.  Kurt Angle and Chris.  No, we talk about it all the time.  It's going to get a different spin on it, Tess.  Go ahead, talk.  Two out of three falls.  Kurt Angle versus Chris Benoit. 
[00:35:30]  First falls, pin falls only.  Second falls, submissions only.  Third falls.  But it never gets to that point.  Like it ends in two falls.  So you're guaranteeing, well, almost guaranteeing a murder.  Yeah, no, you are.  You're saying, yeah, if it goes three, someone will have to die by gunfire in the ring.  And then after two falls, like, oh, sorry, it's over.  Great.  An anal rape match.  Third fall is anal rape.  Oh, Vince.  I sure hope it's over in two. 
[00:36:00]  Jerry, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I just want to let you know, man, it hasn't been an hour, and this is the funniest frigging  show I've ever heard.  Because we're hammered.  You guys got to do this on a weekly basis.  I don't think Ben's going to make it through the whole show.  No.  I hope he does, man.  I don't even know where he is right now.  Oh, he'll come back and start making people.  He's taking a phone call.  Doesn't he sound really angry?  I think the last time I was here, you guys were all like, uh, shot.  That's what we're saying.  That's what we admitted to.  We have a problem. 
[00:36:30]  Now what's the next step?  Because there's no one.  Usually I have one friend or a couple of friends that go, look, it's time for an intervention  or something, and they call you in and do it.  We're all like this.  So it's hard for one person to step forward because we just throw bottles at them.  Taz, we explain.  We're in the middle of a problem.  Are we negotiating right now?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  So they want to keep us happy so they're not brave enough to, you know, tell us that we  have a problem.  So they get you all licking up.  Oh, we're getting away with murder.  Taz, look.  And I swear, this is our office.  That's really your office?  Look at this.  It's a JÃ¤germeister machine. 
[00:37:00]  And after the show, we do ice cold shots of JÃ¤ger.  We drink beer.  And you see this box?  It's full of Greycoast vodka.  Wow.  It's disgusting.  It's sad.  Did you know the Sam Adams cases?  Yeah, look at it.  How did you miss them?  They're all over.  They're just sticking out like a sore thumb.  And you can't see the Summerdale boxes behind the lager.  Did somebody give you it or somebody's buying the stuff for you?  Sam Adams gives it to us.  There's actually a guy named Sam Adams.  That's Jim Cook.  He's the guy.  Jim Cook.  Jim Cook's a raging alcoholic.  Oh, it's amazing.  You ever hear his commercial?  He's like, hi, this is Jim Cook for Sam Adams. 
[00:37:30]  It's like my great-grandfather says, get drunk all the time.  My great-grandfather touched me when I was a child.  Now I drink beer to forget the pain.  My great-grandfather used to beat my great-grandmother in front of me.  Now I drink Sam Adams lager.  All right, before I leave, listen, I know this is a dead issue, but before I leave, can we  just call up Gary Coleman?  Because I've been thinking this over. 
[00:38:00]  I'm a little pissed at him.  You know what?  Yeah, he's still on hold, but we've got a few things to get to him.  He liked you, I think.  Get your bra off and take it off now!  We love that.  I thought you were hanging today.  What kind of fun was this?  I remember the last time I wouldn't leave.  I know.  That was okay, though.  We had a lot of fun.  That was cool.  Yeah, hell yeah.  I've done a lot of radio shows, and I mean it, I ain't blown smoke.  This was definitely the best one.  Yeah, we do it a little differently.  Yeah.  For some reason.  Yeah, just a little.  Yeah.  Anyway, what's that of today now? 
[00:38:30]  What are you throwing out the first pitch?  Throwing out the first pitch?  Yeah.  I think we said it's right.  We'll say it again.  Mets versus the now Los Angeles Dodgers.  Yeah.  And I hope there's some people in the audience because the Mets aren't doing that well.  You know what you've got to do?  Tell me.  What?  You know what you've got to do?  What?  Throw it over to you.  Just throw it into his head.  Yeah, be the first guy to just throw it into the crowd.  I thought about that.  Just right into the crowd.  Can I do that, John?  Throw it into the crowd, man.  I thought I was going to throw it into the crowd.  What about just being Bobby Valentine and just sitting there watching like this? 
[00:39:00]  Boom!  Right in his head.  Tad, let me.  I got to tell you this because I'm a friend.  You just talk a good game.  You'll never do it.  You're right.  I won't.  It's an honor and everything, and you can't ask it all.  Yeah.  I'm not going to do that kind of S.  Why don't you like, because you're a big, tough guy.  You go out there and just throw like a girl.  Don't make it to the play.  Make it bounce like my time.  Can you throw the ball and make it look good?  Actually, I can throw the ball.  Because that's kind of tough from the mound to the plate and make it look good. 
[00:39:30]  I know.  I'm going to try and throw it.  I'll probably throw my shoulder out.  I'll probably throw her.  Hey, Anthony, look at this.  Gary Coleman.  Hold on a second, all right?  Yeah.  After the Mets played last night, they might ask you to pitch the whole game.  Oh, my God.  You want to hang it out?  A new Mets record.  Four homers.  This one's in it.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Did Gary hear us?  Gary, hold on a second, all right?  Should we call him?  Okay.  Yeah.  He's on home.  He's on home.  Yeah.  He loves it.  He loves this show.  Gary, you want to talk to Taz? 
[00:40:00]  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Hold on a second.  He's holding on.  He's holding on.  That's the gag.  We'll just let him hold on until you come back.  Yeah.  Three weeks.  Yeah.  He'll stay there.  Believe me.  Hey, is there going to be any T and A on the pay-per-view this Sunday?  T and A broke up.  They were managed by Trish.  No, I mean the actual T and actual A.  I know they broke up.  China is defending a woman's title versus leader.  That's man A.  T and man A. 
[00:40:30]  And the hardcore championship will be.  There's a big test, big show on the Champions Rhino, so it's going to be like a three-way  triple threat match.  Oh, the big slow.  Yeah.  And then we've got a tag team turmoil match.  Number one contenders get a, whoever wins the match-up, this tag team turmoil deal, they  get a title shot against the current champions, who is Austin and the game.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of guys in that tag team turmoil.  Was it like a year who was in that match-up?  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, why not?  Well, we've got Edge and Christian, seven form of seven times.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Okay.  I'll just call them right now.  No, no, no.  I hope it's going to meet these people immediately.  No, because, you know, dude, I'm begging you to get original.  You did the same laugh as you know.  Wait, hold on.  I'll just do something new.  Look, it makes Tinky laugh. 
[00:41:30]  Tinky's phone doesn't laugh at anything.  All right, anyway.  Oh, he just gave me the sign.  Wow.  What's the matter, WWF guy?  Holy ass.  Is it bad?  Is it going bad?  Or does he have to be somewhere?  No, we've got to know.  We've got to know if it's going bad.  That's what sucks about this show.  Here we are.  Here we are.  Anthony, here we are thinking we're all hanging and we're like actual friends.  And the reality sinks in.  He looks at his watch and points to the pass.  Well, Opie, maybe if you didn't diss the guest, maybe if you had a point to start, you know, 
[00:42:00]  I mean, then maybe I'd stay another three minutes.  Hey, Taz, man, I didn't do it.  You punked my ass off.  I'm sure it was Rick.  Anthony did it.  Taz, you're not on my hand.  I will say, though, what are you looking at him for?  Hang out.  He's my boss.  You know, it's like you're one of those bitches that the guy drives around to the bachelor party.  You know the guy that drives the bachelor party chicks around?  Yeah, that's true.  Come on, baby, time to leave.  We got our money.  I don't want to lose my job. 
[00:42:30]  You know what that's like, guys?  Anyway, I've got to go.  One to one.  All right, touchÃ©, touchÃ©.  But look, I've got to split for real because he's getting pissed.  Yeah.  Taz, have fun with Shay.  Cool, man.  Thanks for having me, guys.  It's always a pleasure.  Come back when you can hang a little bit.  I know you're a busy man these days.  No, but I will.  No, I really had a good time last time.  All right.  I didn't show up a sweep, but tell Gary Coleman I said he can kiss my ass and tell him to go F himself.  Hey, Carmen, what do you think of Taz? 
[00:43:00]  He's a pussy.  Compton.  Hey, that was good, right?  That was kind of new, right?  That was new.  All right, look.  Enough.  All right.  I've got to go.  Are you supposed to make a commercial?  I just take these headsets off and leave.  That's it.  It's okay.  No, because it's great.  You know what's going to happen?  He's one of the guests that it's uncomfortable for him to leave on his phone in the air.  Yeah, no, because I know.  Some of the guys, they don't give a crap.  They go, all right, I'm done.  And they'll just walk out.  Taz will not do that.  I'm a TV guy.  You know what I'm broadcasting?  No, but listen, I'm going to be in the car listening. 
[00:43:30]  Remember the last time?  Right.  I remember.  I threatened you guys, and you guys were cool.  Yeah.  You know, and you segued the tent.  What are you doing, Rick?  You're doing something sneaky.  Look at this.  I've seen you.  You gave me a gig.  You went, look at his arm.  You better watch your hand.  Jacked up, huh?  Last time I've seen arms like that, they're hanging out with a nest.  Anyway.  You've got to hit a button, Rick.  I'm begging you.  No, look, I've got to go.  All right, Taz.  All right, yeah.  We've got to stay on the air.  There he goes.  He's taking his head thumbs up.  All right, Taz. 
[00:44:00]  Taz, say hi to the Mets.  Al Leiter taking the mountain tonight.  Or Taz, whoever pitches better.  There you go, Taz.  I could kick the crap out of that guy.  What are you, insane?  Black the door.  Come on.  All right.  We're in the middle of commercials, I guess.  Oh, that's right.  We had just done a live.  That's really locking the door.  Loser.  Oh, my God.  Wait, he called.  He's banging. 
[00:44:30]  Ah-ha.  It's locked.  Ha-ha, Taz, you're a pussy.  Dude, how you doing?  Taz.  Hey, Taz, you're a pussy.  I'm trying to get back in.  Hey, Taz, look through the window.  Oh, he can't bend the finger.  Ooh.  Hey, Taz.  I don't want any part of this, man.  Shut up.  Oh, no.  You got my back. 
[00:45:00]  He will run through that door.  No, we like that.  I'm kidding.  I know.  It's all in good fun.  Taz is a great guy.  We love Taz.  You see how busy he looked?  Taz.  Taz.  Taz.  Taz.  I think Taz is on the phone.  Taz.  He hung up.  He's going to need a phone.  Outside of a prison visit.  Oh, Jesus.  T-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  They're saying that Taz is trying to call the...  Is he?  Let me see if this works.  Taz?  All right. 
[00:45:30]  Ant.  What's the matter, Taz?  Ant.  You, I'm surprised.  No, you're my pal.  Look, I know how old he is.  Wait, wait.  I didn't do nothing.  I know that.  And the other little nitsy, little stupid, little silly basket that's in there.  Uh-oh.  I don't even know his deal.  But, uh, Ant.  Ant.  Ooh.  I'm surprised that you went.  Taz, you know, I was just kidding.  There's a jump in a ring.  Oh, Ben, you better watch it out.  It's all in good humor.  It's all in good humor.  Look, I gotta go.  I gotta go.  All right, Taz.  But anyway, I'll see you guys real soon.  Okay.  All right, Taz.  Bye.  Ben, be nice to Taz. 
[00:46:00]  Faggot.  I'm kidding.  This is great.  Hey, Dick.  He got in.  I won't say right away.  He got in.  Did you see Ben freak out?  No way am I doing this.  Ben, if you shouldn't think like you do of liquor.  Oh, my God.  Holy cow.  Did you see Ben freak out?  I was like, yeah, yeah.  He got in.  Oh, my God.  They got the key. 
[00:46:30]  He opened the door and flew in right up to Ben.  Ben's face.  He freaked out like he was going to be killed.  I ain't screwing with that guy.  It was like you saw a ghost, man.  He was just being able to talk the most crap.  But when that door opened, I was like, oh, my God.  What am I going to do?  What am I going to do?  I'm dying, Ben.  You're going to die.  He was in the middle of saying something.  God damn, is that funny.  He was in the middle of abusing him again.  And then the door goes first and open.  He doesn't look like it anymore, does he?  He was in Ben's face. 
[00:47:00]  He just sobered up real quick.  He was two inches from your face.  You just sobered up, my friend.  No, I am not going to screw with that.  The liquor shop is going to save the price.  He's more fast than anyone, but not with one of those guys.  Classic, man.  Taz, what a pisser, man.  He's a cool guy.  We like Taz.  All right.  We'll be back in just a bit here.  Yeah.  It's O.T.  Give us a call on 1027-WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour. 
[00:47:30]  By O.P. and Vinny.  Proofing the truth.  All right.  This is 1027-WNEW.  Yeah, it's the ONA show.  212-757-1027.  You can do it.  Kristen, what's going on?  Basically, I've been listening to the show since it began today,  and I find Ben still freaking hot right now.  Did she curse?  No, freaking. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, freaking.  Okay, good.  Don't worry.  I'm not going to curse.  A hungover Ben?  Yes, that is so hot.  Ben?  Kristen thinks you're hot when you're hungover.  But he's not really hungover.  He's still drunk.  The picture is not that great.  Don't worry.  I still think you're hot.  Believe me, I'm obsessed.  You're obsessed with Ben, huh?  Oh, yes.  I've written about my friend Bobby.  He convinced me to, because I'm a really good writer,  to write a few stories about Ben also. 
[00:48:30]  Me and Ben getting together, getting our F on.  Whoa.  Yeah, and I wrote him a poem.  I'm, like, obsessed with him.  He was a whore.  Yeah.  That's a good way.  Basically, I'm Ben Thor.  Hey, who's the stripper?  Do you have one of these poems in front of you?  Yes, I do, actually.  Ah, good.  Yeah, let's hear a poem about Ben.  This is Kristen.  Um, give me a minute.  I have to get it, because, like, I just have to open it up.  I'm on my laptop at the moment. 
[00:49:00]  Okay.  Give me a moment.  I'm, like, really, really nervous.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  How do you spell nervous?  Okay.  Yeah.  But believe me, I love Ben.  I think he's so freaking hot.  Wow, look at that.  Yeah.  Ben's completely confused right now.  Where's your poem?  Um, what?  Where's your poem?  It's coming up right now.  Okay.  Oh, it's on the computer?  Yes, it is.  Ah.  Because I save everything.  I work better on the computer. 
[00:49:30]  Nice.  All right.  My poem is called Ode to Whatever Ben.  Ode to Whatever Ben.  Yes.  Um, on the radio.  Oh, wait, what?  Is this a haiku or just a regular poem?  No, it's a poem.  Okay.  Ah, poem.  Let's all listen.  Ben, listen.  Okay.  On the radio, I heard him one day, and I was stuck by beauty in a radio god form.  Soon every day, I listened to his eight minutes.  Eight minutes of pure adrenaline. 
[00:50:00]  What I could do as Ben in that time.  Ben, oh, Ben, how I dream of you at night.  And hope, above all hope, that you might want me too.  Ben, oh, Ben, I've even shed tears for you, my love.  Remember when, Opie broke your stool?  I cried.  Cried for you.  Cried for your anguish.  Ben, oh, Betty, what can I do without your eight minutes?  Whatever.  Whatever Ben wants from me, he can have.  That's all I have. 
[00:50:30]  Wow.  Ben, what do you think of your little poem?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's it.  She's effing insane.  It didn't say effing.  Ben, out of her mind, she wrote this stuff.  Mark wanted her email address, because Mark wants to bang her.  Mark wants to bang me?  Probably.  I mean...  Oh, my good Lord.  You really, honestly, need to get a life.  It's eight minutes.  It's two stupid songs.  Have you met her at home?  No, I have no idea who she is, and she should jump in front of a bus.  Why don't you describe yourself a little? 
[00:51:00]  Me, I'm 5'3", about 120 pounds.  Where are you right now?  I'm in my house.  Where's that?  New York, Nassau County.  Oh, you're a Long Islander.  How old a gal are you?  17.  Aw, a teen.  Come on, Ben.  How many hot teen girls want you?  Come on.  But we don't know if you're hot.  Well, I'm pretty cute.  They sell your fat slob.  Oh, my God. 
[00:51:30]  Ben, it's one of our listeners.  Ben, I'm sorry.  Give us a little more description.  We can show ourselves and stuff.  Give us a little more description of your hair.  I've got long red hair.  Long red hair.  Green eyes.  Green eyes.  I've got long legs.  40...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Okay.  You can't say the...  You can say big T's.  40 what?  How big are they?  Double D.  40 double D?  Yeah.  Yeah, big cabs available.  I don't know.  No, see, uh, you know, I was going to say that I would love to hook up with you one time, 
[00:52:00]  but you sound like a real, uh, a-hole.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  An a-hole.  Wait, after that poem, just talking to him a few minutes, and now he's an a-hole?  Well, he's, like, affording me, okay?  I've liked you for a long time now.  Just tell yourself.  Please jump in front of a bus, Di.  Uh, why don't you go in front of a bus?  Wow, Ben.  You obviously are a loser.  I don't believe you.  Well, I'm the loser.  You're a loser.  You wrote something about two friggin' songs on a radio station. 
[00:52:30]  It was a joke.  A joke?  Can you take a joke?  No, you can't.  Tell yourself, please.  Uh, no.  Mark's available.  Wash your hair, Ben.  Tell yourself, please.  From what I've heard today, you need to go take a shower.  Oh.  Go back to high school.  Go study.  Uh-huh.  Tell yourself now.  Yeah, that's nice.  Okay.  F you.  F you. 
[00:53:00]  F you.  That's good.  You're funny, you know?  I am.  You should get eight minutes.  Oh.  Wow.  Ben, what's the problem?  What happened?  She's a filthy animal.  She pulled you a little poem, though.  Yeah.  And I thought you were cute.  I ripped it in half when I got it.  Rick, Rick wiped his, uh, behind with it in the bathroom.  Kristen, you gonna be okay with this rejection from Ben?  Uh, whatever.  Whatever Ben, right?  Whatever.  Right.  Sure.  Whatever Ben wants to do to himself now. 
[00:53:30]  Ooh, you're funny.  Yeah, honestly.  Please, do the world a favor.  Jump in front of a bus and get killed.  I'd rather not.  I have more of a life than that.  Obviously, right.  Wow.  Yeah, Ben, she's only 17.  Ben is not happy with me.  I know.  I don't understand it myself.  You know, I thought he would be happy, you know, to have, like, a fan. 
[00:54:00]  I hate everyone.  Hold on a minute.  He's really belligerent.  Obviously.  Jim Norton, what's going on?  Ben, what are you doing?  Norton, she's all yours.  She's a filthy whore.  Ben.  Ben, don't do this.  17 with red hair.  Norton, she's all yours.  You can do whatever you want.  Well, she doesn't write poems about me.  She likes you.  And that's the problem.  Although, Jim, I have written something about you and Stinky.  Because it's part of my whole story. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  What did you call it?  AIDS and the potheads?  Oh, my God.  No, actually, because...  Oh, my God.  What?  Yes, Kristen?  As I have mentioned before, I wrote this whole series of stories about Kristen and Ben.  You got any more?  I want to hear the Stinky...  Poems?  I don't have any more poems.  I only wrote one.  Give us a piece of the Norton Stinky short story.  Well, it's... 
[00:55:00]  What's the fact that I've just mentioned a little thing where in some of the stories, Ben has walked in on Stinky...  I'm going to get a life, Ty.  Hold on, Ben.  I want to hear about me and Stinky.  What are you doing?  Shut up, Ben, for a minute.  Now, Ben's a good guy.  That's you.  Wait.  Okay.  Gene, Spank.  Wait.  This is how I'm hot.  You write stories where Ben walks in on Stinky doing...  No, no, no, no, Ben.  No, no, no.  These aren't stories incredibly around them.  They're just, like, little paragraphs where, like, Ben has walked in on Stinky being, like, Spanky, a cheap prostitute, basically. 
[00:55:30]  And it goes more twisted, and he ends up walking in on Jim Norton's Spanky and Stinky.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That would be a whole joke.  Could you write a poem about me being killed by a fat boy in an econo lodge in Long Island?  Um, no, that's okay.  That's very upsetting that you want to drink out of Ben's mule, but you have me and Spanky.  Spanky, Spanky, hook it up. 
[00:56:00]  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Oh, wow.  Guy, come on.  You know, whatever, okay.  I think you're a nice girl.  I like you.  Thank you.  You're only 17, though, huh?  Yeah.  Could you pretend you're younger?  No.  Thank you.  No.  No.  Um, I don't know.  Maybe.  I'm just saying, you know, two people for the fun of it, you know, for the goof, not to be really dirty.  All right.  Dirty, dirty, girl.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  Well, we should let, uh, Kristen go.  Kristen, you got rejected today.  17 years old, 5'3", with 40 double Ds.  Ben doesn't want anything to do with you.  Yeah, well, Ben's a whore, whatever.  Well, you know what should happen?  Ooh.  I think that Norton and you should talk, because Ben, I can talk to Ben for you.  All right.  Okay.  I don't want to talk to her, you know.  You know what, Ben?  Maybe when you're not so belligerent, maybe you'll, you know, realize some hot girl wanted  to talk to you for a while.  Maybe flirt with you.  No, I don't wish.  Oh, whoa.  No cursing. 
[00:57:00]  No cursing.  Hey, does anybody, what's your name, Kristen?  Yes.  Does anybody have your email address?  You can't get it out of the air, though.  Um, uh, no, I don't think so.  No.  Should I be a pal and put both of them on hold, or should I hang up on Jim and Kristen?  Oh.  Hmm.  Be a pal, Al.  Choices.  You want, you want to hang with Norton?  Um, I guess.  That's not very convincing.  Do you drink alcohol?  Uh, sometimes.  I can put on glasses and pretend I'm Ben. 
[00:57:30]  That might work.  No, that's okay.  She really wants Ben.  Yes, I do.  I always found him so hot until now.  You know, I hurt.  What attracted you to Ben at first, Kristen?  Um, because I never saw him at first.  I, um, I heard his voice and I found his voice incredibly hot.  Mm-hmm.  And, like, his teeth and music.  Shut up, guy.  Oh, man.  Uh, F off.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Can I talk?  Sounds like such a skanky whore.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:58:00]  No, actually.  I'm not.  I'm telling you, the more I hear Ben, the more I want to drink out of his mule.  You don't know how happy you're making me.  This girl is a filthy whore, Norton.  You should punch your teeth out.  Wow.  Ben, where's this anger coming from?  Oh, that makes you so happy.  I mean, it's...  All right.  Well, yeah, nothing better than to write a poem to me.  It's like, you know, go watch.  Kristen, it's not really working out too well today.  No, I don't think we have a love connection.  Yeah.  Oh, that sucks.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  Well, you're not going to cry or anything, all right?  Go back to social studies.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  All right, Kristen.  I guess we'll let you go.  Yeah, all right, then.  Any final words for Ben?  Ben, you suck ass.  You need to get a life.  And maybe when you get a life, look me up in the phone book, okay?  Because you just missed a chance of a lifetime, all right?  Shut up, you fat skank.  Shut up.  I don't want to shut up, you whore.  I almost swore. 
[00:59:00]  Kiss my ass.  Would you please go out on 57th Street and get hit by a bus?  I'd rather not.  Why don't I have my...  Why don't I just want to kick your ass, all right?  Shut up, you whore.  Hang up.  Yeah.  Hang up on a rope, please.  Wow.  Ben, I'm trying.  I know.  Obi, can I ask you a question, Obi?  Yes, Kristen.  All right.  How would you take it if some cute girl...  Shut up, twat.  Shut up, please.  Shut up.  You're a fat slob.  I don't want to talk to you.  You have nothing better than talking about my stupid two songs. 
[00:59:30]  You're a loser.  Loser.  See you later.  Oh, Pam, please.  I'm trying, Ben.  For some reason, there's something wrong with the phone, so maybe we'll be able to fix that  in a minute.  All right.  I'm going to put Kristen and Jim Norton on the whole thing.  Go back to science class.  No, that's okay.  Don't be more.  All right.  All right, Jim, thank you.  All right, boys.  Jim, you're the greatest.  All right.  Take care, bud.  Kristen, thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, okay.  All right.  There they go.  Let them hook up.  Wow. 
[01:00:00]  Ben.  That's love.  Ben.  Jumbo.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  All right, Jumbo.  Listen, I think at this point we can all agree it's time to buy Ben a box of wine.  Box of wine.  887th Avenue, 57th Avenue.  No way to box of wine.  Ben, you freaking loser.  I know Ben's rocking.  You had one on the hook and what did you do?  Threw it away.  Ben could barely stand.  She is a loser.  You're an old lonely wino.  Three rights.  Make a laugh.  All right, Jumbo.  You know what? 
[01:00:30]  We don't need any more alcohol and you can see for yourself.  You go to WNAW.com.  Go to the Oakland Anthony section.  Scott Colombo has about three or four pictures up of our office just in case you thought we were  kidding.  It's sad.  Really.  Want to describe the pictures?  Ben, go to the pictures of our office, please.  It's really sad.  The first picture, we have a corner of the O&A office.  All right, describe what's in the corner.  All right.  Well, this is the one we looked at earlier.  It's got the basketball hoop on the back of the door, the JÃ¤germeister machine, the beer 
[01:01:00]  fridge to the right of the foosball table, and under the beer fridge is the food fridge  that's full of beer.  Right.  And then all the Sam Adams cases that came in today.  And some tremble, right?  A little tremble.  Also, we have a part of the Dice poster and a part of the Olsen Twins poster.  The Olsen Twins poster.  And a poster that's also featured at Bada Bing in The Sopranos.  We've got the same poster, you'll notice.  Yes.  All right.  Second picture, a picture of the open refrigerator.  Now, one of these fridges is supposed to have food in it. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  But instead, it has lots and lots of beer and lots and lots of Planet Java.  I see a couple of Seagram's products on the door, and I see some vodka.  A bottle of vodka chilling.  Yeah.  That's our fridge, okay.  And then a collection of booze by the windows is picture three.  Right.  And that, you'll see just some of the various bottled spirits we have.  It is a basketball.  Yeah, we've been looking for that basketball.  It was by the booze.  And this is, the last picture is a picture of Ben's basket. 
[01:02:00]  Ben and Pinky's pile.  Well, it's just, the phone you see is Ben's phone and Ben's computer,  and Pinky's little segment is to the left of that, where the fan is pointing.  Here you go.  Hey, Zach, what's up?  Yo, O&A.  Hey.  You guys have some great friggin' shows, you know?  All right, we're trying.  But like, in an hour and a half, you managed to top them all.  Oh, Jesus.  Thank you, Zach.  More alcohol.  And drink the beer first.  All right, thank you. 
[01:02:30]  Thank you.  Let's go to Noel.  Noel, what's up?  Yo, what's up with Ben, man?  What do you mean?  You would think, when you're drunk, you want some hands, right?  Nah, he turned it off.  Why he did that?  He was turned off by the poetry and stuff.  I guess so.  Yeah, Ben, get on the mic.  What turned you off about that girl?  Yeah, man.  All right, thanks a lot, man.  All right, what was the thing that just made you go, you know what?  I'm a freaking freak, dude.  I mean, let's be honest.  All right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll box one. 
[01:03:00]  It sounded like something that maybe you would want to look into.  It's ripping Anthony off.  Dan, what's going on?  That was something you might want to look into.  Oh, I know.  Dan, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I know what made him not take that chick.  Huh?  He's a fag.  No, Ben is not a fag.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  What the hell was that about?  She was, like, in his lap, ready to go.  He just shouted down.  Ben's all about the unexpected.  I'll tell you that one.  What's that all about?  I didn't think he'd get so angry.  I didn't think so.  Look at that.  The girl was being nice, little palm.  She is a loser.  Oh, come on, man.  Dude, anyone that sits and writes about my stupid little two songs is a loser.  I play two songs on a talk station in New York. 
[01:04:00]  Those two songs are never good anyway.  What?  Those two songs are never good songs anyway.  Wait, wait, wait.  They suck.  Come on.  Ben's wound up today.  Let's relax.  Yeah.  Sam, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, pal?  I got a problem for Ben.  Yeah.  Rose is a red guy with a blue.  You're a faggot.  Uh-oh.  All right, man.  That was hilarious.  What?  Dice.  It's nice.  Paul, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Yo, Ben, who the F are you to tell that poor girl to jump in front of a bus? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, any small girl would...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  All right, she may be fat, okay?  But what if that was a poor girl with really low self-esteem and she did jump in front of that  freaking bus and died?  How the F would you feel?  Dude, that would be the greatest thing ever.  Honestly?  That would be great.  You have no consideration for other people in life?  No, I don't.  I'm a complete dick.  Where are you right now?  I'm in Jersey.  All right.  Jump in front of a bus. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you, man?  We told you.  He had two hours sleep.  He's still drunk from last night.  We're not kidding.  You think we're kidding?  No, this is not a joke.  I'm saying, but that, I mean, you know what I mean?  Like, Opie and Anthony, great show.  Hello?  We should get a picture of that.  All disheveled?  Put him on the list.  There's no reason to do that.  All disheveled.  That would be nice.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We've got to say hi to Phil from Extra, Anthony.  Ah.  Hey, Phil.  Hey.  What's your last name? 
[01:05:30]  Schumann.  Schumann?  Ah, they spelled it wrong on the screen.  Phil Schumann from Extra, everyone.  Yes.  What's going on, Phil?  You're spelling on the radio now?  Might as well.  That's why I got on the TV.  I didn't have to spell.  Don't get Ben upset.  Yeah.  What did you get?  What was it, like an eight-year-old girl you had on earlier?  Uh, 17.  She was 17.  Yeah, right.  She was 17.  Wow.  Everyone is angry today.  Everyone's very angry.  I'm fine.  It's like 80 degrees and sunny here.  I'm going away for the weekend, assuming they don't arrest Robert Blake.  Yeah.  Well, how's that looking? 
[01:06:00]  Well, it's not looking too good in terms of anything happening quickly.  Otherwise, it would have happened by now.  You know, tonight will be two weeks since the shooting.  Yeah.  And is it looking like they're getting any closer?  It doesn't look that way, although you really can't pry any information out of the police  department.  There's a lot of stories going around.  Sources say this.  Sources say that.  But you hear sort of conflicting stories.  So there's really no solid info about what progress they're making, if any.  Any hunches on your part being in the business?  Well, I mean, the hunch that we've all had right since the beginning is that Blake is  somehow involved. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  Because his story just doesn't seem to make sense on the face of it.  There's too many question marks.  Yeah.  Like what?  Well, like, you know, why did he park the car three blocks away from a restaurant with  a big parking lot that he supposedly had a reserved face in?  Oh, look at that.  Why did he leave the woman in the car by herself at night while he went back to get his gun when  the whole reason he was supposedly carrying the gun was because he was afraid for her  safety?  Yeah.  Look at Phil.  Where has he been for the past two weeks?  If someone's accusing you, even indirectly, of killing your wife and you didn't do it,  aren't you going to be screaming that at the top of your lungs? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, if you're carrying a gun, do you forget it on the booth next to you in a restaurant?  Yeah, that's kind of weird.  So it's not exactly like, you know, you forgot your sunglasses.  Yeah.  Well, we all know how that ends.  So, you know, there's just a few there.  Just a few questions.  Don't forget your sunglasses either, though.  Yeah.  Phil, we love O.J.'s involvement in this whole thing.  Yeah.  O.J.'s thing is just spicy.  Well, we interviewed O.J. in Florida earlier this week and it ran last night on Extra and  then it's running tonight also. 
[01:07:30]  Did he kill any of the staff of Extra?  Did he kill any?  Yeah.  No.  Oh, okay.  Not that we know of.  But, you know, in his mind, he hasn't killed anybody ever.  Does that piss you off?  Because it pisses me off to think that he might actually believe that he didn't do it.  I think that sort of the armchair psychologist and even the professional psychologist talk  about him convincing himself that he's innocent.  Yeah, but I'm just hoping even for a minute a day, it goes in his head like, oh, my God,  I did it.  And then he could forget about it and think he didn't do it.  But as long as it's even for a minute. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, it's even more strange than that.  Imagine what it's like for his two kids.  Yeah.  They live with him there.  You know, Justin, I think, is 15.  And, uh, Sidney's 15 and Justin's 12 now.  I thought Sidney ate Justin.  Sidney's actually grown into a lovely young lady.  We're going to have pictures of her on our report on Monday.  Not to, you know, to plug too blatantly.  But, yeah, that was part of what we talked with O.G. about, about his new wife in Florida.  She had a little baby fat on her, I guess.  A little bit.  But, hey, we all go through that.  Right.  Looking good now, huh?  Now, what is O.G. going to say tonight, Phil? 
[01:08:30]  Well, tonight he's talking about how he couldn't help but have sympathy for Robert Blake because he knows what he's going to be going through over the next couple of weeks.  He also talks, and this is really actually kind of sad.  People don't remember this, but O.G. had an infant daughter from his first marriage who died in a drowning accident.  Oh, I remember that.  And he talks about how it's not fair for us to judge people's reaction to tragedy.  And he talks about when that happened with his daughter that he decided to go out to a bar with a bunch of friends of his. 
[01:09:00]  And I got as drunk as I've ever been in my life.  And, you know, he says it's not fair to judge what Blake should or shouldn't be doing right now in terms of staying in seclusion.  He also tells them that if they don't catch who did it, that he has to go on with his wife.  Because that's what he's tried to do.  Oh, my God.  I see.  William Shatner wasn't over the house that day when the baby drowned, was he?  You guys are bad.  You guys are bad.  I'm just wondering. 
[01:09:30]  Nobody even remembers that.  I know what you're talking about.  The guy from Exx was telling us we're bad.  Yeah, that whole William Shatner thing kind of, you know, because there were suspicions there.  There were suspicions, but it's mainly because of us cynical weasels on the news media.  You know, we raise suspicions about everything.  God, did you park the pool in the backyard?  Yeah, the sun didn't come up today.  You know, sources say Robert Blake may be involved.  Yeah.  You know, we need to fill up airtime, right?  I mean, there's the radio, there's TV, there's MSNBC, there's CNN, there's the Fox News Channel. 
[01:10:00]  There's all the local newscasts.  We're in suites right now.  I mean, everybody thinks that this is a great story, but it's easy to lose sight of the fact that,  not to bring everybody down, but, you know, a woman was murdered.  There's an 11-month-old baby girl that doesn't have a mother now.  And this is a really sad case.  Now, when you talk to O.J., do you look at his hands and think, like, God, that, you know,  that held a knife and slit people's throats?  Like, it would creep me out.  It's tough because I actually covered the O.J. trial.  I was in the courtroom. 
[01:10:30]  I was in the courtroom for the verdict.  I covered the civil trial.  So, you know, I have a lot of emotions and a lot of thoughts about that.  And it's not really my job as, you know, the unbiased journalist to give my opinions about what O.J. did or didn't do in his past.  I think, you know, surveys of most right-thinking Americans speak for themselves.  But, again, we didn't go to him on this story without some concern about giving him a platform, so to speak.  But because there's so many parallels between the Blake situation and between his case, 
[01:11:00]  we felt that, like it or not, his opinions were relevant to this story.  Yeah, well, O.J. sells, believe me.  Anytime I see him on the paper or on TV, I've got to tune in.  Yeah, he was on the front page of the Post yesterday.  I've got to hear what this nut's going to say now.  He's, like, sort of become this national curiosity, you know?  Yeah, exactly.  If you had an opportunity to have him on, you'd have him on, right?  Hell, yeah.  I've got no problems.  I was just saying earlier that, you know, the failed XFL?  Yeah.  They should have had him on the sidelines. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, man, that would have been hot.  I mean, I would have thought about that.  I would tune in.  You put him in the Bruno Mali shoes.  You put the gloves on him, and you have him on the sidelines talking about, you know, the LA Extreme.  And don't forget, you know, he used to be a commentator for NBC.  And Dick Ebersole, you know, the head of NBC Sports, is a buddy of his.  Oh, yeah.  It was.  Yeah.  I wonder if they talked about that.  That never came out.  I don't have to find out about that.  That would have been a coup, I think, to just have him on the sidelines.  They couldn't have done it.  They couldn't have done it.  Yeah, but you know something?  Just the publicity factor alone of talking about it would have got them something. 
[01:12:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  You've got Jesse Ventura in the booth.  Great.  What about the whole reference you made to the Ramseys with the lie detector?  Well, that was one of the points that he was made in offering advice to Blake.  Now, when he said that, and what exactly did he say?  Well, what his advice was was not to take a lie detector test.  And this is interesting because this came out much, much later after OJ's trial, is that  back in the beginning when Bob Shapiro was his only attorney, apparently had him take a  lie detector test.  And defense attorneys do this often on their own, with their own information. 
[01:12:30]  And apparently Simpson slunked it miserably.  Now, that never came out.  I wonder why.  Oh, yeah, because he killed those people.  Yeah, right.  That never came out during the trial.  And, of course, they're not admissible anyway.  Right.  But his advice, which was interesting, is that don't take the lie detector test.  Because if you pass it, nobody will believe you.  And if you don't pass it, then it will be used against you, at least if it ever comes out,  even in the court of public opinion, not necessarily in the courtroom itself.  Right.  I think, aside from the lie detector that he failed, his blood and her blood all over 
[01:13:00]  the place might have been a little more evidence than a lie detector, just son of a bitch.  Well, you know, don't get me started on what did and didn't happen on the OJ Simpson criminal  trial.  We don't have to relive that.  Let's just say that there were a lot of problems with the case, the least of which was  the jury.  Yeah, yeah.  So they proved their case, you know, to me and you.  Now, when he...  You know, we weren't in the jury box.  When he came out with the Ramsey thing, though, I'm like, he's talking about a dead girl and 
[01:13:30]  how the parents, like, didn't...  Yeah, he talks about it from the perspective of the defendant.  He never says anything about the victim.  Like, when we talked with him about the Blake case, his immediate reaction was sympathy for  Blake.  Of course.  Not sympathy for the dead woman.  Of course.  No, not sympathy for her.  And don't diss your dead ex, he says.  Right.  How about don't kill your dead ex?  I'm sure his lawyers didn't do that.  I mean, come on.  Yeah, I know.  All they did was trash this woman, try to drag her into some drug ring and whatnot. 
[01:14:00]  Exactly.  Having sex on the couch while he looked through the window because he was so concerned about  his kids.  I don't know.  You could talk about this stuff forever.  Forever.  We're still fascinated by OJ.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to get to see him on Extra tonight once again.  Yeah.  Tonight at Extra.  I think we're on at 7 o'clock there on Channel 4.  Right on.  And then we've got a little bit more on Monday.  So we'll keep you posted if something happens with this Blake thing.  I'm sure you guys will be all over it.  Yeah, Phil, we'd love to talk to you from time to time.  All right.  Well, thanks for having me on.  I appreciate it.  Right on.  No problem, Phil.  Thank you, Phil.  Take care.  There you go.  Still from Extra. 
[01:14:30]  Extra OJ on Extra.  Look at that.  I love it.  Tonight at 7.  We were in the office last night getting hammered, and we were watching the OJ thing.  We were watching the Extra last night and just laughing our asses off at OJ.  It doesn't matter what he's saying.  When he's on screen and he's talking and he's all serious and he's got such conviction  in what he's saying, we all just laugh at him because he killed two people.  He's crazy.  Because he's a nut.  He's crazy.  He's crazy, I tell you.  That man's crazy.  All right.  I'd give something away, but Ben just wandered off. 
[01:15:00]  Ben wandered.  You made him sound like an Alzheimer's patient at the hall.  I swear to God, he just wandered off.  Where's Ben?  Ben wandered off.  I hope he has his IG.  He's crying.  Ben.  I just went for a walk.  All right.  Let's give something away.  What do you want to give away?  There's nowhere to walk to.  I went for a walk.  I went for a walk.  I walked 10 feet outside.  All right.  You guys just love it. 
[01:15:30]  I got to throw the guy, Ben.  Shut up.  Ben, you're hilarious today.  Fun, fun, fun.  Wait, let me talk to Kim.  Kim, what's up?  Nothing.  Just got on my way to the airport.  Okay.  How are you guys doing tonight?  We're having a lot of fun.  I hope it sounds like something.  Kim?  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I was answering you.  Now, what do you have for the show?  Well, actually, I just wanted to make a statement about Kristen.  The 17-year-old? 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  Do you think she's like all that?  First of all, you guys need to have somebody with a little bit more experience, I think,  than she probably has.  And she was totally lying about her weight.  How do you know?  She sounded fat on the phone?  No, it's obvious because she, well, first of all, when you asked her, you know.  Yeah, the 40 double Ds have to give it away, right?  40 is kind of weird on the back.  40 is very big.  Yeah, 40, let me explain to the guys.  40 is the backside.  That's the back of the shoulders. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  Well, yes, 40 is the point that's underneath, like, the point around the underneath part.  Right.  When you, you know, like, underneath the breast, and then the cup size is how many inches out  from there it is.  Well, we understand that.  Double Ds, big boobs, 40, kind of a big back.  Right.  Yeah, because I'm 5'4", and I weigh 119 pounds, and I'm a 30-40.  Right.  So, I mean, you know she's going to be a big girl.  Right.  And she's just full of it. 
[01:17:00]  She says she was 5'3", 125 pounds.  Right.  Yeah.  Now, there's just no way.  There's no way.  Because I'm taller than her, and I weigh less than she does.  Ben, would you like to berate this woman?  Ben is giving me the blah, blah, blah sign.  No, Ben, go ahead and berate me.  I don't care.  No, I'm not going to.  No, don't berate any more of our listeners, Ben.  Ever since I came...  According to everyone except us, they're saying we're losing listeners for some bizarre reason. 
[01:17:30]  Well, I just started working...  You're not losing listeners, you fools.  I just started working in the New York area, and I listen to you all every day.  All right.  Kim, you want to go see Bon Jovi?  Sure.  Will you use these tickets?  My man is there.  Oh, never.  I would love to.  All right.  We got a pair of tickets to see Bon Jovi at Giant Stadium on Saturday, July 28th.  Okay.  You can get tickets through Ticketmaster, but if you hold on the line, we'll give you a pair.  You're going to use them, though, right?  Totally.  All right.  Thank you.  Totally.  Oh, you guys are so awesome.  I love you.  All right. 
[01:18:00]  Thanks, Tim.  Thank you.  Have a good weekend.  Thanks.  You, too.  All right.  There she goes.  This is interesting.  Yeah.  Someone just instant feedback, some information that they're getting from a new service.  There's been a rash of apparent auto-induced suicides in the tri-state area.  Various people throwing themselves in front of buses yelling, Ben sucks.  I just have no idea what may have caused this phenomenon.  Monkey?  It's Monkey Man.  Jump in front of a bunch.  What's up with your bunch?  What?  What ain't no country I haven't heard of. 
[01:18:30]  They speak English and what?  Uh, what?  English, mother f***ing dude.  You keep it.  Yeah.  Then you know what I'm saying.  Uh, what?  Say what again.  Say what again.  I dare you.  I don't dare you, mother f***er.  Say what one more damn time.  Uh, okay.  What?  Destroy, destroy.  What much?  Hey, Anthony, look at this.  Sam Adams.  What can we possibly say about Sam Adams? 
[01:19:00]  If you don't think we drink this stuff, go to WNAW.com, click on Opie and Anthony, and  see pictures of our office.  It's everywhere.  You'll see a lot of cases of Sam Adams.  We love it.  We go back after the show, and we drink some Sam's.  Oh, look at this.  What is that now?  All right.  It's the, uh, summer ale that Stinky just brought in.  Oh, God.  All right.  Give me an opener.  Let me open this up.  I'll use my bell. 
[01:19:30]  I'm pretty good at opening.  There we go.  Beer with anything.  Uh, let me, let me try some summer ale.  Okay.  You don't have to make the noise.  I'll really do it.  Don't give Ben a beer.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, shut up.  No, you don't open it like that, Rick.  You open it with the bell.  Anyone can open any bottle.  You grip it. 
[01:20:00]  Your, your pointer finger to the front of the bottle, your thumb to the back.  Now, over your pointer finger, where it's wrapped around the bottleneck, very tight and  very close to the cap, you wedge anything under.  Using your finger as a lever, you then push down as a fulcrum.  Yes.  Ow, and, and the cap goes right in your face.  And you pop it open.  There.  Try it at home, kids.  With your beer.  What?  Oh.  Great job. 
[01:20:30]  Great job.  Ooh, that was funny.  White shorts.  Everyone's so angry today.  And it's all due to Sam Adams.  I'm kidding, of course.  Watch.  You watch how much nicer Ben gets after a couple of Sam's.  But then you got to stop him.  Sam Adams.  It's a world-class beer.  And it's won quite a few awards, Opie.  At the Helsinki Beer Festival, Beer of the Year.  Five gold medals in New Zealand.  And two gold medals at the International Beer Competition in London. 
[01:21:00]  Sam sold in 19 countries around the world.  Well, it's won more than 200 international awards in the last two and a half years.  More than any other beer on the planet.  And more than any other beer in history.  Sam Adams.  Catch the best of Opie and Anthony.  Saturday, today's W.  11 to 3.  1027 WNEW.  Drudge Jr. wants in for a minute here.  Hey, guys.  Drudge Jr., what's going on?  I have a very big exclusive.  An exclusive, Opie. 
[01:21:30]  Yes.  Breaking news from Drudge Jr., our roving reporter who actually said that I was going to sign with Comedy World Network.  Was that it?  Yes.  And, uh, Amir, a month later, Comedy World was bankrupt and no more.  Well, this is almost as big as it's true.  Ah.  The last thing you printed was false.  Yes.  Okay, what do you got, Drudge?  Well, uh, I think it's no secret that the sports guys are in a lot of trouble. 
[01:22:00]  Why do you say that?  Well, they have pretty low ratings.  Right.  Last rated show, right?  The whole place has low ratings, Drudge Jr.  Right.  Well, them especially.  So, they're going to be fired if they don't get their million listeners.  And they're going to be replaced by a southern show called John, Boy, and Billy.  Oh, my God. 
[01:22:30]  You could not be further from the truth.  Come on.  What are you talking about?  That's so true.  I got that from a new source at your station.  Who is the source at our station?  You know something?  They're joking with you, then.  No, they're not.  And trying to feed you false information.  John, Boy, and Billy, they do like a good old boy show.  Yeah, they talk about, like, NASCAR racing.  And it's very southern-oriented and wouldn't really play in New York.  They're bringing it to the south of the north.  No. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, they're coming to New York.  The south coming to the north.  They're going to, I don't know, maybe.  Drudge, do you check anything anyone tells you, or do you just print it as it's news?  I called the guys in North Carolina, and they said, we can't talk about it.  Yeah, what radio guy's going to deny that they're going to be on in New York?  Right.  Of course, you're going to want that rumor around if somebody puts it out there.  But, Judge Jr., you can guarantee that's not happening. 
[01:23:30]  Here's your source, Opie and Anthony.  We're saying it's guaranteed that has not happened.  That's right.  How do you know that?  Well, I think we would have been told.  Judge Jr., what's the word on the street about us?  About you?  About us.  Yeah.  What rumors have you heard about this very program?  Well, if you don't get your ratings back up, you're probably not going to be syndicated.  Our ratings are fine.  You lost a lot of listeners. 
[01:24:00]  No, we didn't.  With that Ben thing.  With the Ben thing?  What do you mean with the Ben thing?  It's just a funny joke from Judge Jr.  Oh, wow, that's good.  No, Judge Jr., our ratings are fine and we're going to be syndicated.  Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.  All right?  All right, if you say so.  We do say so.  He believes these half-assed sources that are out there.  He believes it and he prints it on his little website, but he does not believe when it's  a source that is, you know, oh, I got it from a source at the station.  We're a source at the station. 
[01:24:30]  And we're telling you.  And we're telling you now, I don't know who your other source is, but it's probably not  as accurate as the one you're on the phone with right now.  Well, you don't know that for sure.  No, we do.  That's what I'm telling you.  We do know that for sure.  Does this help your story any, getting this side of it?  I can say that Oprah and Anthony tonight.  But your source doesn't.  And your source could be like, Eddie, Drudge Jr., don't you get that we could be your source 
[01:25:00]  here at WNEW?  Yeah.  We could give you some fine scoops.  Why wouldn't you believe us and then consider that gospel?  Well, I guess I could make that work.  Give me your cell phone number or something.  No, no.  If it's nothing like that, we'll say it on the air.  If you have a story or you...  You can't say half the stuff that goes on on the air.  If you've heard a rumor about something, you address it.  We will tell you, okay, yes, we've heard that. 
[01:25:30]  Or we will tell you, no, that is absolutely not true.  And as far as the John William Billy thing goes, no, Drudge Jr.  It's not true.  It's not true.  And then in a few months...  Maybe they just didn't tell you about it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Because it makes so much sense if you...  Well, I don't have all the details.  I'll put it up on my site.  The website that crashes when 10 people hit it?  No. 
[01:26:00]  I reset the hit bar.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Weren't you on the message board telling people that we were in court because of another radio personality?  No, I said I thought it was...  Wait, wait.  You heard what?  What?  You said...  Sorry, Anthony.  I just want to get to the bottom of this.  What did you say we were in court?  I said I thought that was what it was about.  So you're spreading false rumors.  I was in court on my own personal account.  No, I just said that's what I thought it was about, but I didn't say that. 
[01:26:30]  Don't you think as a journalist and as a Drudge Jr., you shouldn't even speculate like that?  It doesn't matter.  People on the message board don't care about what I say anyway.  Hey, Drudge Jr., I got a scoop for you.  The new morning show at W.A.W.?  Mm-hmm.  Simpson and Blake.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's John Boy and Billy.  No, it's not John Boy and Billy.  John Boy and Billy.  Do you think New York would accept a show called John Boy and Billy, a couple of southern redneck guys? 
[01:27:00]  I don't know.  You're the radio people.  Hey, Drudge Jr.?  Yes.  How's it going with our contracts?  Yeah, have you heard anything about that?  No, I can't get any information on that.  Why can't you give any information on that?  Nobody's talking to me.  Are you calling around trying to get a scoop?  Yes.  Who have you been calling?  People at your station.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Ken and Jeremy? 
[01:27:30]  The guy that told me this works with Jeremy, so I thought it'd be true.  The guy that told you what?  The John Boy and Billy thing.  He works with Jeremy.  Oh, he works with Jeremy?  Yeah.  Is his name Craig?  Was it Craig?  I'm not saying anything.  I'm not saying who it is.  He doesn't want to give out his source, Anthony.  He works with Jeremy.  No one works with Jeremy.  This is a hysterical drug.  You are so wrong.  You are the worst reporter ever.  Ever.  But he's starting out, isn't he?  You're like the Globe or the Inquirer. 
[01:28:00]  You're worse than the Weekly World News with Bat Boy.  Yeah, what do you got on Monkey Man?  Monkey Man.  What do you think about Monkey Man in India?  He's probably just some guy with a beard.  Did you get a source to tell you that?  Well, I know that the original pictures of him was just a guy with a beard that liked  to bite people.  And then it evolved into an alien monkey that has three balls on his chest.  The guy with the beard that likes to bite people is our own Ken Stevens. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  All right, Drudge Jr.  Keep working on those scoops, okay?  I'm the worst reporter ever.  You are the worst reporter ever.  I think you're pretty cool.  Because you're only what?  Like 14, 15?  13.  What?  13.  13.  And next time we're in court, you can report that it's because we're there for a libel suit  against Drudge Jr.  Okay.  DrudgeJr.Homestead.com.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much. 
[01:29:00]  There he goes.  Drudge Jr. with another scoop.  His accuracy is zero.  I mean, the guy has not hit one thing even close.  Anthony's in negotiations with Comedy World net radio over the Internet thing.  A month later, it goes under.  I've never even heard it.  The first time I heard of it was from Drudge Jr. telling me I'm negotiating with them.  Oh, my good God. 
[01:29:30]  Scott, what's going on?  You really got to ask yourself, who's worse in accuracy, Spaz or Drudge Jr.?  Can we really tell which one's worse?  I don't know.  They're pretty both bad.  My God.  Drudge Jr. has a brain, though.  I also wanted to say that I'm an underground listener from Richmond,  and where the John Boy and Billy show is on,  and holy cow, I can't believe that he even thought that that would happen.  That show is so terrible.  It's very regional, let's say.  Yeah.  What I wanted to know is, if you sign or re-sign, whatever's going on with that,  what are you guys going to do with all of the tons of alcohol that is in that studio? 
[01:30:00]  You're not going to be able to drink it by June.  Do you think that when you sign, you're just going to be like,  all right, well, now that your honeymoon is over, you've got to get rid of it all?  Yeah, that kind of sucks, because then they're going to be like, after we sign, you know, if we do.  Well, then the night before, it's going to be all my binge.  We've got to get rid of it all.  Come on.  Get the funnel out.  Keep them guessing, Opie.  Of course.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  All right.  Very good. 
[01:30:30]  John Boy and Billy checking in.  Terudge Jr. misunderstood.  We're in negotiations with Comedy World Race.  Hey, let's go to the F.U. line.  How's that sound?  All right.  I don't know where we're at.  Right there?  I hit it.  Thanks for calling.  No, go.  Start over.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Now go.  Thanks for calling.  And this is the Opie and Anthony F.U. Friday line.  You don't want to send an S.U. out to Opie and Anthony for canceling their tickets off  of Cross County.  Me and my friends wait there for two hours.  Thanks a lot.  Peace bag.  Next message.  All you rich bastards who rent my limo and don't bother to tip the driver or you can all 
[01:31:00]  go f*** yourself.  I'll drop you at the airport.  So you better be careful because if you take a drink from them glasses, I haven't washed  those glasses in two effing years.  So f*** you people.  I'll probably f*** you in your luggage as soon as you turn your back.  F*** all of you.  F*** you.  Tip your driver, you cheap f*** suckers.  Next message.  Hey, this is Amanda.  I just want to give a big F.U. to all those people who don't wear underarm deodorant on  the bus and they're sitting having the smell of this crap. 
[01:31:30]  F*** you.  Next message.  You want to give a big F.U. to my S.N. company, you stupid mother effer S-head.  Tommy left his tingle message, playing and firing everybody just like that at you.  End of message.  Opie.  I'm the dick.  Enfimmy.  Yeah, well, I'm an ass.  The Opie and Enfimmy show. 
[01:32:00]  I would have rather watched my grandparents give oral pleasures to each other.  Oh.  1027.  W.N.E.W.  It's the O&H show.  212-757-1027.  A little taste of Gravity Kills.  Kilt day.  On the O&H show.  A little drama going on in here today, I'll tell you that.  We've got a pissed off Mary in the studio.  A lot of drama.  What's wrong, Mary? 
[01:32:30]  I am not second wife's girlfriend.  I am not a girl or a whore he picks up on his road show.  So, if that's what he thinks, he should go left himself.  Wow.  Wait, what happened?  All right, what happened?  I need a background on this because I left.  I know nothing.  Well, apparently, I was wowing everybody and I was his girlfriend last night, so...  Wait a minute.  What happened?  Run me through it.  I just got a phone call from my boyfriend saying,  Did you listen to the show?  You were apparently your Psycho Mark's girlfriend.  It was just a hard rock last night, wowing everybody. 
[01:33:00]  So, here I came to go yell at Ben because apparently Ben was the one saying it  and now it's Psycho Mark.  Oh.  I just don't want to be in the middle of it.  I love you guys, but it's just bull.  Ben, were you making accusations as to whether she was Mark's girlfriend?  Ben, let me strap in.  I need my seatbelt.  I need a safety harness.  Yeah, I'm not going to get involved in this friggin' fiasco.  But, but, was something said that might lead her to believe? 
[01:33:30]  You know, I don't know what the hell happened last night.  I don't know.  Steve, do you remember?  She's making the universal sign, drinking heavily.  There's Mark right down the hotline.  Uh-oh.  Wait, so what is, what is, I don't get what this is all about.  Yeah.  Basically, I have a really pissed off boyfriend at home that thinks that I'm cheating on him with Mark.  And I hang out with him, he's a cool guy, but we're not going out.  I'm not his girlfriend.  Psycho Mark.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing, man? 
[01:34:00]  I am so mad.  I am going to choke Ben with both my hands and then I'm going to ram his head down a toilet.  He's a complete a-hole.  I'm never going to talk to you again.  Sticky is a jerk, too.  I don't like you guys anymore.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I got to know what happened.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Because we have a brand new audience here because work just ended. 
[01:34:30]  Ben is getting yelled at.  Ben is still drunk.  He had two hours sleep.  Psycho Mark is really pissed at him.  He doesn't want to talk to him ever again.  You know what?  I'm not going to rail, Mark.  Psycho Mark, what's going on?  What happened?  Well, no, I get it.  I mean, first of all, Ben called me 75 times last night.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, I'm never going to talk to you again, dude.  Oh, get on the phone.  You kissed his ass last night.  Oh, get me back on the show. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, man.  Ben, you are so full of ass, Ben.  What is with you?  Are you still drunk?  No, no.  Look, I'm not going to slam you.  I mean, let's just stick with the facts.  All right, so what's going on here?  Mary's saying she doesn't go out with Mark.  She doesn't.  She's not my girlfriend.  So where was that said?  Who said that so that your boyfriend got...  Ben said that.  Ben said that.  What's that said?  Ben, you said it last night on the phone.  I got a call from you, you drunk effing loser, from the hard rock going, 
[01:35:30]  John, I'll break down.  You're playing against the whole party.  You're following everybody.  Now, she's not even my girlfriend, okay?  How can you say that?  Ben, comment?  I don't know.  I know that we played a little gag on you, and you took it way too seriously.  It was a little joke where Stinky was like...  No, because it went a little farther than just a joke.  You called me and told me you would never talk to me again.  Because you're a complete asshole when you're drunk. 
[01:36:00]  What's the Stinky factor here?  How did Stinky get dragged into this drunken suit?  What did Stinky have to do with this?  I was used as the jealousy factor.  What do you mean?  We were telling them that, you know, Mary was flashing everyone,  and she was going to go home with me and stuff.  But why would Mark care about that if Mary's not his girlfriend?  Good question, Opie.  God damn.  Let me explain something, all right? 
[01:36:30]  Yes, Mark?  If I ever called Ben and ever said anything about him with a girl or his girlfriend,  he would pummel me with a goddamn hammer.  But that's not even a question here,  because you said you and Mary had nothing going on,  so it's no big deal.  All right.  No, all right.  What pissed me off was Ben being belittently drunk,  and they just can't take it.  I'm never going to talk to you again.  You're no longer my friend.  No, no, Ben, you know, you're out of control.  No, Mark, you're a wuss.  I'm a wuss.  Why am I a wuss? 
[01:37:00]  Mark, you called me and left me a message.  God damn it, I wish I saved it.  You go, I will never talk to you again.  You're no longer my friend.  I'll never talk to you again.  Ed, Sticky is a loser, and I'll never talk to him again.  All right.  Do you have a left hand?  You didn't.  Hold on.  I'm waiting for an effort.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  Calm down, everybody.  Calm down.  But why are you so pissed off?  You're a cold-blown alcoholic.  You're a cold-blown alcoholic, okay?  You need help.  I'm a wuss.  That's not a compliment.  I should know. 
[01:37:30]  I'm one too.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, don't you think one would be able to tell the other?  Okay.  You're a lot of control.  So you took this joke way too seriously, our friend.  In fact, Mary told me you left a very nasty message for her as well.  That was just a completely shocker thing.  It's none of your business.  She just pulled us off the air.  She still has it.  What's it, her?  She just said she still has it.  I don't like getting an attitude.  That's all.  And your boyfriend's pissed now. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, now I have to go home and deal with this.  All right, can we stop the cursing?  Let's watch the cursing.  All right.  So now you're going to go home and deal with this trash.  Believe it or not, we're doing a radio show.  All the crap that happens when Ben drinks.  Oh, shut up, dude.  Ben, you are.  Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark.  Chuck.  Mark, Chuck.  Says you called.  And then when Opie got on the phone, your tune changed so fast.  Opie, please get me back.  When the new contract comes about, I need to come back.  I need to meet more girls with the contract, please. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, please.  Ben, you're making sure you said that, dude.  Opie was dying when he got off the phone last night.  He goes, Mark is so desperate to get back on the show.  I never did enough to thank you.  You were so full.  Dude, I am not.  Oh, Opie, can I beg for that?  Opie said, dude.  Can I?  What?  What happened?  Ow.  Jesus.  What a mess.  This will be.  Did I beg for the hard rock last night? 
[01:39:00]  No, I was not.  Oh, it's not.  We want to have you back.  I've been waiting for the day that you guys go at it on the air.  Because I've seen this in person where Ben and Michael Mark go at.  It's classic stuff.  Were you at the hard rock last night?  No, I was.  I'm working.  No, no, I'm not talking about you.  Shut up.  I was talking to the girl who's not your girlfriend.  But you were there.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I was just wondering.  I know.  Okay.  Believe me, after a while of being there, I couldn't tell you who was there either.  I know.  I'm not involved in this whole cluster F that's going on, but I was involved in the drinking. 
[01:39:30]  But why wasn't your boyfriend there?  He couldn't make it.  Did he know you were going there?  No.  Did you see Psycho Mark at all last night?  At the end, yeah.  He showed up at the hard rock?  Yeah.  And by that point, Ben, were you there?  No, I was not.  You had already left.  Okay.  We were up here.  What?  What?  What? 
[01:40:00]  Dude, that's the after hours right there.  After hours.  In our office.  She was in our office.  You and Psycho Mark.  No, no, no, no, no.  We were a couple of us.  Wait, you guys were doing...  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now we learn a little more.  Stinky.  You're the man.  Hold on.  PR.  PR.  PR also?  A Dominican.  Stinky.  Wait, so you're the one having the after hours.  Then how come you didn't come in and say, oh, I was in last night?  I'm going to show you.  You didn't say anything about last night. 
[01:40:30]  I'm never there.  Oh, my God.  So, Stinky, you, PR.  Who else?  Uh, that kid old Lando.  Yeah.  Oh, that's that.  Lando, Rory.  Those guys are drug dealers.  John.  No, no, no.  Hey, John.  John.  Hello?  John.  Yeah?  Turn on your effing radio.  Turn the radio down.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  How long have you been listening to the show? 
[01:41:00]  Now, you're Mary's boyfriend.  Yeah.  All right.  What the hell do you want to add to this?  I just wanted to.  I didn't know why she was down there.  She's saying I wasn't available.  She told me she was going for a girl's night out with Angela.  Uh-oh.  Did you say it was a girl's night out?  Yes.  Oh, Jesus H. Christ.  Mark, you still there?  Come on.  I really, you know what?  There is something going on.  I don't know what the hell is going on here, but we have all the parties involved. 
[01:41:30]  I think we could sort it out.  Can I just put the facts on the table without anyone getting pissed off?  All right.  No one comment yet.  Everyone hold.  This is all the stuff that has been said on the radio, so I don't want anyone pissed  at me.  You hear me, Mark?  Yeah, I hear you.  All right.  Now, rumor has it that Mary was flashing everyone at Hard Rock Cafe.  Ben went on the air and said that it's Psycho Mark's girlfriend, Mary.  So we pulled a joke on Psycho Mark and called him and said that his girlfriend was flashing  to everyone.  Mary heard this whole thing on the radio today and marched down to the studio to tell everyone 
[01:42:00]  that she is not Psycho Mark's girlfriend, right?  Right?  Okay.  And then Mary told her boyfriend, who's now on the line, John, that she was going out last  night with the girl.  Girl's night out, and that's why he didn't go to the Hard Rock with her.  Right.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You didn't hear that.  What?  What did she say?  What did she say?  It made up.  It was on my account.  What did she say? 
[01:42:30]  It just said, I didn't want him to go.  And he wanted to go.  He never lets me do anything.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You can't curse.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  John, she's got a problem with you're not working.  John, she's...  I might build the page.  John, she's...  I got money in the bank.  She says you do nothing, and you never let it do anything.  You don't have an effing job, and you sit on your ass all day.  That's what she's saying. 
[01:43:00]  She's home today.  Were you home today, John?  No, I was out to work, and I had a doctor's appointment, and then I came home and listened  to the show, and I hear that...  Your girlfriend's seeing someone else.  How long have you guys been going out?  You and John?  I've been off for a couple of years.  I'd say an off turn is coming around again really quick.  I really want to get close with you.  You know what?  Just pack your bags, because I don't even want you there when I get home.  Because if you don't trust me or anything, then... 
[01:43:30]  Trust you?  Hold on.  I've got to step in for John.  You said you were going out with a girl's night out, and you ended up at the Hard Rock,  and then back here with Stinky, Dinky, Winky, and Drug Dealing.  Right.  So wait, how do you get and say that he doesn't trust you?  I have no problem with a girl's night out.  That's the only way I can get out.  With the lovely Stinky, the gorgeous Orlando, and with that girl's night out?  Playing basketball in our office, spilling drinks on the floor. 
[01:44:00]  Stinky.  You have the vagina.  Stinky is throwing the after-hours parties in our office.  Stinky's having to have the...  What are you charging the cover at the door?  20 bucks.  Mark, you got anything there?  Yeah, what is this?  Change of heart?  So, is Mary breaking up with John?  What happened?  What happened there?  I don't care anymore.  I don't care.  John?  She doesn't like what I do.  They're probably going for a girl's night out, but then I hear on the radio she's flashing  everybody and hanging out with a bunch of guys.  That doesn't sound like a girl's night out to me.  Were you flashing at all? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, I did.  Oh, okay.  Because I'm gonna, because that's what wow is.  All right.  Okay.  She's wowing.  She's wowing.  All right.  Here.  Here.  I'm going to do it right now, John.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This feels so bad.  All right.  Calm down, Mary.  Sit down.  Put your shirt back on.  You're going to see some Jamaican Mike after this is over.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Go ahead.  Every time you break up with me, you'll call me two days later.  Whatever.  I don't care.  If you're going to be a crybaby, just go home. 
[01:45:00]  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Jamaican Mike here.  Jamaican Mike, she wants to get some of you.  Oh, you want to get some of me?  Yeah.  Maybe just a tip.  Her boyfriend, John, is on the phone, but she just broke up.  And now she's, wow.  Going right for it, you chicks.  Jesus Christ.  Who is that?  Who's on the phone?  John?  Psycho Mark.  I'm still here.  We lost John.  What happened to John?  John, run away?  What happened to John?  Well, Mary, I think, just broke up with her boyfriend live on our show.  See what happens when you chicks break up with you? 
[01:45:30]  This is the first time a big Jamaican baby's arm clutching an apple.  And I'm ready.  This is the first time that Psycho Mark's been speechless.  Mark, you didn't say a word.  What am I going to possibly add to this cluster app?  I was in dens of full-blown alcoholics.  Back to Ben.  That's my whole thing.  I was just mad at Ben.  I mean, that was the whole thing.  Dude, shut up.  Mark, did you end up back here last night? 
[01:46:00]  Uh, yeah.  Kind of.  I hope it's good.  She'll be back on the show.  All right.  So, Mark, what time did you get home last night, Mary?  What time did I?  Two.  Two?  This afternoon?  No.  Okay.  I'm just wondering.  One second, Mark.  So you're not banging Mary, right?  No.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, boy.  I think we're done.  Psycho Mark ain't big enough.  Oh! 
[01:46:30]  Oh, you give a little high five there if you make me nice.  I mean, please, what am I going to do?  And isn't that cool what Mike used to high five her with?  So, Mary, do you have a problem?  I've seen an anaconda.  Does Mary have a problem with Psycho Mark now?  No.  No.  No, just this.  I'm not his girlfriend.  That's all.  Now, my girlfriend, is that in the Bill Clinton way?  Are we talking?  Is there anything between you two that...  No, he's just a good friend.  Just a good friend. 
[01:47:00]  A good friend and a hookup.  A hookup?  A hookup.  Oh, okay.  A hookup.  It's Ben John.  AK-47.  There you go.  See, now everyone has only asked that simple question.  Everything would have all been dancing.  So, Ben.  Ben, I'm going to knock your teeth out because you're an alcoholic.  I love you, Ben.  I'll talk to you later.  I won't be hiring me back.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Ben had something to say.  I'm not.  I'm sorry. 
[01:47:30]  You got you.  I got you.  Go to bed.  Go get a frigging aspirin, will you?  My God.  All right.  What a twisted little story.  All right.  Ben is done.  Mark, I think you're done.  I'm done.  I'm going back to Paul.  Mary wants to say one more thing.  I just want to plug my friend's restaurant.  Walsh is.  Oh, come on.  He was supposed to do it.  Walsh is in Nyack.  Walsh is in Nyack.  It's my restaurant.  I know it. 
[01:48:00]  My last name is Walsh.  It's worth mine.  It's worth mine.  Hold on.  Someone is really pissed off on the phone here.  Kathy, what's going on?  Yeah, Mary, man.  Why are you being such a little lying tramp?  And you would be?  My name is Kathy.  And why can't you be honest with this guy?  What's up with this?  Well, if you knew my whole story, he can go out and DJ and have...  Hold on.  Hold on.  He's a DJ.  He could go out.  Yeah, and he's out until 6 o'clock in the morning.  He doesn't go to work.  He just got a job that he was out for for four days. 
[01:48:30]  Isn't the DJ in work, though?  Okay, so you live with this.  You put up with this.  And you still feel the need to lie to him?  Yeah.  That's insane.  Just tell him I'm going out with the guys.  I'm going to splash my Hooters.  I'm going to have a good time.  Yeah, well, I...  You know, when I come home.  I've been trying to get him out, but he's not doing it.  So maybe today he finally understood.  Go F this home.  That's ridiculous.  But now everybody thinks you're a liar.  So now anybody wants you now is just going to want to see your Hooters.  They're not going to have a boyfriend after this. 
[01:49:00]  You think so?  Well, you know what?  You can go F yourself, you know?  I don't need guys.  I could...  Girls, guys, it doesn't matter.  Well, you must need this guy, John, if you feel the need to lie to him, if you can't  be truthful.  And?  Is what he said true?  That in two days you'll be, like, calling him back and saying, okay, come back now?  I think he will.  No?  No.  Of course he will.  No.  I've been looking for a way out for a long time.  Whoa.  Wow.  You're looking for a way out?  Just tell him you're going out with the guys. 
[01:49:30]  You're not looking for a way out if you're lying to him?  I have.  I have.  And nothing works.  He just keeps coming back.  So maybe this will open his eyes.  Now I'm free.  Three is a bird.  Wow.  Would you say, what are the odds that being free right now, that you're getting laid tonight?  On a scale of?  One to ten.  Ten being definitely getting laid.  Really?  Ten.  Raymond, what's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  This married chick is a worthless lion.  I'm already John's better off without her, man. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, my goodness.  She was out there last night getting a train pulled on about all sorts of drug dealers.  This guy shouldn't even be sweating it.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Well, you guys, are you guys still on with you?  Yeah.  I'm going to get going.  I'm going to get back to work here at Fox.  That's fine.  We'll be those days at Fox.  Let me call you guys 20 times to tell you every story happening on Fox.  I wish we had.  Was that bad?  Yeah.  You're priceless.  I am good, all right? 
[01:50:30]  You're priceless.  Today I've been laughing all day because you're such a drunk.  Look who's talking.  Hey, I'm dying.  I called.  Did they say you're drunk?  See you later.  Hey, Kathleen.  Yeah.  What's up?  I want to tell Mary, you know, what is she, an idiot?  She's acting like 14.  If you don't want to be with somebody, you just tell them.  She just did.  Yeah.  You don't tell them like that, though.  All right.  Thank you, Kathleen.  I guess there's things we don't know about. 
[01:51:00]  This is like a frigging soap opera.  Well, yeah.  I wish we had the music.  But Mary, do you know my friend John Black?  Mary, I will make you my queen of the night.  Marlena.  Pull the strings.  Yes.  Do you go by the name Marlena?  Where's John Black?  You know what I'm writing?  I am Stefano DeMira.  You know, Anthony, something else came out of this break.  You look like Hope.  Or Gina.  Which one?  I'm such a faggot. 
[01:51:30]  I know of you.  Pull my tampon string.  Pull my tampon string.  Something else came out of this today.  What, Opie?  I think he's having after-hours parties in a row.  I know.  Wait a minute.  He thinks he's off the effing hook here.  We've been thinking.  We've been trying to figure out, you know, who's throwing the after-hour party.  Who threw a bottle against the wall?  Not me.  That sounds like something PR or Old Dirty would do or something.  Invite it in.  We went back to visit the stairwell, and then we smoked, like, a couple cigarettes in New York.  They're checking the fire extinguisher pressure. 
[01:52:00]  I'm sure.  You can make a bong out of a fire extinguisher.  Lily, what's going on?  Hi.  I was wondering if I could get John's phone number for Mary, since she won't be needing it anymore.  It's 845.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  Don't give out.  Oh, my good gosh.  If you want it, I don't know.  She'll give it to you off the air.  Hold on.  I think John should be able to get laid tonight, too. 
[01:52:30]  Because I just hate the idea.  Because, girls, it's so easy.  You break up.  That night, you go to a bar, you're getting F'd.  For a guy, it's like, oh, I broke up.  Okay, I'm going to show her.  I'm going to get F'd.  You go home that night, and you're cranking it because you didn't work out at the bar.  All right, let's move on.  Thank you, Mary.  That was a lot of fun.  Mary, I'm glad we could help your relationship out.  Thank you, guys.  Now that you're all calm.  Thanks.  Unbelievable.  And Jamaican Mike, maybe you want to trade numbers or something. 
[01:53:00]  But John.  But John wasn't doing a good job.  All right.  Wow.  I'm just making it work.  If you're making it work.  Let me tell you something, Mary.  If you sleep with Jamaican Mike, you're going to be walking like I was walking after I had that  piece of crap today at 3 o'clock with your hands, cheeks together, limping.  What?  Hold on.  Brian has something?  Brian, yeah.  Brian.  You got the whole gang.  What's up? 
[01:53:30]  She, that girl, I'm John's friend.  She doesn't really know me too well.  She is such a pig.  She, you go to a bar with her, you get, you get, she's been seen on John for so long already.  Disgusting.  How do you know her?  I don't know her too well.  I just know that she's...  So then how do you know what she's doing?  I, I, I hear some things about her.  You hear her?  But I'm trying to pick up, trying to pick up her down a little bit, you know.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  But thanks.  He's full of ass.  All right.  I know.  But the stinky after hours parties are just like, because we're wondering, and then, 
[01:54:00]  stinky, you got to, you got to listen here.  We're talking about it just before, the beginning of the show, we're talking about someone's having  after hour parties in, in the office.  You didn't come in and say, hey, I was in there last night.  I did.  I came in here and I was raising my hand.  No, you didn't.  No, no.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I told her, I'll admit it.  I went and we, we hung out in the office.  All right.  But when we were talking about it, you didn't come in and go, you know, oh, I was in there  last night.  Because we didn't spill beer on. 
[01:54:30]  No, but we were, we were asking who was in there after hours and you didn't say anything.  No one referred to last night.  All right.  Come on, stinky, you're lying.  Come on.  I really don't go there and hang out every night.  Okay.  We have to take a break.  Let's go to the FU line.  Wow.  It is FU Friday, obviously.  Yeah.  Hit it.  Thanks for calling.  And this is the Opie and Anthony FU Friday.  I would like to give an FU out to all of you motherfuckers on the New York segmentation 
[01:55:00]  that think you are hot, but in reality you are a bunch of f***ing monguloids.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to send a big stinking FU out there to all those Middlesex County Indian  women driving around in full garb, no taller than four feet tall, driving their cars, holding  up traffic, not stopping for stop signs, not using their directionals.  Get off the road and ride a camel, you freaking idiots.  FU. 
[01:55:30]  Next message.  This is a big FU to my ex-boss, you hypocritical, condescending.  You say despairing remarks about me.  Well, I got your number.  Huh?  Don't you like emails?  Well, I sent them all in and now you've got to pay for that lawyer.  You don't think you can send an honest email to people?  Well, I got your number.  I got your trade.  Don't let me see if he f***s your ass.  F*** you.  End of message.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Like listening to Corky and Karen Quinlan. 
[01:56:00]  Opie and Anthony.  I'm about to hear my penis advice and listen to those.  Opie and Anthony.  You nerve-wracking sons of bitches.  1027.  WNEW.  Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Ah, yes.  212-757-1027 is the phone number. 
[01:56:30]  Wow, I need a drink!  A pootie!  Yeah, we've recognized the fact that we all have problems.  I hate this party!  All right, anyone else want to break up with anyone today?  Man, that went horribly wrong.  I don't know.  I thought Mary came in here to tell everyone that she's not Psychomar's girlfriend. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, girlfriend.  Because she has a boyfriend and her boyfriend was pissed.  And now she doesn't have a boyfriend.  It ends with her breaking up.  I see her lying scumbag.  With her boyfriend.  All right, we've got to move on.  George, what's up?  Hey, man, it's time for an intervention.  Yeah.  It's time you guys realize, you know, the first step in the program says that you're powerless  over alcohol and your lives have become unmanageable.  I looked at those pictures on the website.  You guys need help.  Yeah, there's pictures of our office on the website. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  It's not good to have JÃ¤germeister in your office like that.  I mean, it's one thing to have a couple of bottles.  It's another thing to have a dispenser.  The machine, yeah.  Oh, man.  The JÃ¤germeister machine.  Ben's got the real problem, though.  We've got a seat waiting for him in the program.  Hey, Ben's very mellow right now, so let's keep it that way.  Yeah.  Don't get him all riled up again.  Oh, no.  Send him over.  We'll send him back 30 days later.  He'll be a new man.  Yeah, sure he will.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  I like the pissed off, Ben. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, it's a great new character.  Oh, no.  Here he comes.  I know you'll appreciate this.  Did you guys notice the little call we got off air?  You got me.  What, Sycamore?  You got me.  Sycamore called up off the air.  Ben takes it.  The first thing he goes is, what the F do you want?  Using all the proper words, not letters.  And then I guess Sycamore was saying something.  Ben's listening, and then he just goes, F you.  And again, using the real words. 
[01:58:30]  You don't understand it.  Mark and I are actually really good friends, and this is all for good radio.  Yeah.  I've seen this stuff happen when there was no mics around.  This is hysterical.  All right.  That was too much.  I'm exhausted from that.  This is...  What?  What happened?  Like seven.  Let's go to Serge.  Serge, what's going on?  Well, I work at Shea Stadium, and I was just watching a mistake batting practice, and 
[01:59:00]  Taz decided to join him and swing a couple of pitches, and he sucked.  He was pathetic.  He missed everything.  Wait.  Taz is from the WWF.  He was in here earlier.  He's thrown out the first pitch at the Mets game tonight.  Yeah.  But he took some batting practice.  Yeah.  He took batting practice, and literally he got one ball past the pitcher's mound.  But he can see everything, I'm sure, right now.  Do you see him right now?  He's pathetic.  Pathetic.  Is he in view?  Excuse me?  Can you see him right now? 
[01:59:30]  No, he walked off.  He's in the Mets dugout taking pictures and all that crap.  Oh, we've got to get him.  We've got to get Taz on the phone now.  What's the number of the Mets dugout?  We've got to get him on the phone, because it's embarrassing.  He missed everything.  Literally.  Whoever has a cell phone, well, no one's looking tough at the game, duh.  I know.  We need to get Taz back on the air today.  Yeah, somebody from WWF, maybe they have his cell number.  At some point, get in touch with Taz, have him call it,  because we want to rag him for not being able to hit a ball out of the infield.  All right, Serge, thanks for that.  That always looks sad when there's, like, a big guy, and he can't hit. 
[02:00:00]  It's like he's swinging a hammer at the fair trying to ring the bell,  and it goes up to Limp D.  Limp D.  Like, really sad.  Limp D.  Don't forget pay-per-view this Sunday, Anthony.  Yes, of course.  Of course.  Of course.  We were talking about that a lot earlier in the show.  Yes, with Taz.  A couple weeks ago, we were talking about the egg-shooting lady.  Yeah, yeah.  I found the audio from the egg-shooting lady.  Oh, we wanted to run through this.  Yeah, we had a woman come in and say she said she could shoot eggs 
[02:00:30]  out of her most intimate of areas and get some range on it.  So we set up a tarp and marked her off like a football field.  And she did it.  And we took batting practice.  Yeah, we swung a wiffle ball bat at a few of the eggs that she fired out,  like a little pitching machine.  And we also had a blind Dave try to catch the eggs in an Easter basket.  He's legally blind.  And she's firing eggs at him.  Yeah, it came up on the show a couple weeks ago. 
[02:01:00]  I said I would try to find it.  We got it.  Well, yeah.  Make sure Craig doesn't dump out of this.  Because we don't know where the eggs are flying out of and things like that.  I think we were very cautious about how we were describing it.  As a matter of fact, the lawyers went over this little bit,  and they said it was okay, Craig.  Here you go.  All right?  Right.  So we go back in time to the O&A archives.  Oh, yeah.  We're going back in time.  We're listening to a spot.  Or a bit.  Yeah.  Oh.  This is how we sounded like a year ago.  So we're really going back in time for a second. 
[02:01:30]  I'm like, Opie, where'd you get this powder?  I was scared for a minute.  Egg shooting.  Yes.  We are very psyched for today's show.  Well, Opie, today is a shining example of the quality radio that has brought us up in the ratings.  Of course, today is the egg shooting day.  Yes.  Dave, the blind guy, is here.  He's going to attempt to catch some of the eggs that are being shot out.  We've got our listeners and everything out there ready for this, Anthony.  On our little remote mics now, making our way to the field. 
[02:02:00]  I feel like we're on the wide world of sports, Opie.  There's Ivory.  She's pretty much ready.  She's got the table.  And what do you guys think of Ivory, huh?  All right.  She's way down the other end of the field.  Wow.  The crowd just really getting psyched up for this.  All right.  Hold on.  She's in position, Anthony.  Yeah, look.  She's already loaded up.  She's got one in the clip.  Reloading.  All right.  She's loading, you know what?  She's leaning back.  Whoa.  Wait a minute. 
[02:02:30]  Six feet.  Hold on a minute.  That's eight feet.  Wait.  It hit just before the...  Yeah, about eight feet, Anthony.  Whoa.  All right.  Ivory has reloaded.  Oh, that one.  Yeah, that one's just over eight feet.  About eight feet.  Two inches, I would say.  Ivory's reloaded, Anthony.  Yeah.  We got the blind guy about six feet away from ground zero.  Okay.  Here we go.  Dave, the blind guy.  Oh, yeah.  He got it.  He got it. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, what a day for sports.  Throwing it up in the air.  Well, as you can imagine, the blind guy just caught the egg.  Well, Mikey, you don't usually get a day in sports like this.  You got to give him a lot of credit to him for Justin Allen.  You know, you got to give him a lot of credit.  I think that bitch was a little low on outside, and he picked up on it.  Good eyes. 
[02:03:30]  Good eyes.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, there you have it.  Some of the egg shooting I like.  Yeah.  I hope they didn't dump out of that, because you don't know where the eggs are coming from,  right?  Of course.  No dumps, Rick?  No.  Oh, look at us.  Doing radio the right way.  Nice.  See, nice.  I'm over here now.  Hey, Steve, you doing all right?  No.  I now heard that you had a problem with the guy that was buying everyone's shots.  There was a guy there last night that bought like $500 worth of shots and drinks for everybody. 
[02:04:00]  I had no problem with everybody who bought $500.  Well, that's what happened.  He bought you a shot, and then he goes, hey, foundry music sucks.  Like, he's joking.  You get in his face like you're going to kick his ass.  What?  And you're like, what?  What?  Like, what did that look like?  Uh-oh.  And then you were informed that, hey, no, the guy's been buying everyone's shots.  Oh.  And then you said, okay, and you talked to him for like an hour. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, wait.  No, that guy.  Oh, no, he's real cool.  He was real cool.  You don't remember the point where he wasn't cool?  No.  No, evidently not.  All right.  I think, from what I'm hearing, I threatened to kill several people.  Oh, that's nice.  That's a joke.  I have no recollection whatsoever.  And as the alcohol poisoning wears off.  Yeah.  I find myself quite tired.  Yeah, you look really beat now.  Everyone does.  You're going home soon, Steve?  Um, I don't know, but I thought I might have a frosty beverage. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, you should.  It makes you feel better.  Yeah, I think so.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, Scott.  Yo.  What's up, buddy?  Well, I'm sitting in this effing Holland tunnel traffic, and I'm just curious, how does a girl  find out that she has talent to be able to shoot eggs from her most intimate of areas?  Well, we really don't know.  I mean, that girl is a star on the bachelor party circuit.  Yeah, how it happened was we found out about it.  Somebody called up and described the bachelor party, said there was a girl that did this.  We put the word out and said, hey, come on down. 
[02:05:30]  We need this.  And she came down.  But I think we did ask her, how do you learn that you can do this?  She learned from, this is kind of sad, but she learned from someone else that ended up dying of AIDS.  Yeah, yeah, another girl that used to do this on the circuit.  It's like a carnival trick or something.  But they really do.  You guys need to put out your own Girls Gone Wild video.  Girls Gone Wild.  We have a lot of great videos.  Or Night Girl Gone Wild.  You watch those commercials late at night for Girls Gone Wild.  Don't you look like, who the hell is getting these? 
[02:06:00]  And you just know it's a bunch of old guys just greasing it up and having a night watching college chicks on video,  taking their tops off.  But they're not strippers.  They're not whores.  These are ordinary girls.  Ordinary girls.  Gone Wild.  Like, you can't, must be 18 years of age.  I wanted to do this, and maybe we could work some kind of a bit out, record it at night.  Get a kid like Drudge Jr. with that voice that you know is a kid, and have them call up to order.  Says you've got to be 18 or older. 
[02:06:30]  And have them go, I'm 30.  You know, and see if the people sell it.  Because something tells me they don't care.  Of course they'll sell it.  Hi.  No, I'm 35, and I want Girls Gone Wild.  I'm the shot guy from last night.  Rumor has it, Opie and Anthony are filming one.  Girls Gone Wild.  Dion.  Yeah.  You know the shot guy from last night?  Yeah.  You spent like $500 on the crew.  That's all right.  You guys are worth it.  You guys are good.  Well, thank you.  That was a fun-filled night. 
[02:07:00]  You can't see, but Ben is applauding you, and he's bowing for the phone.  Yes.  Yes.  You guys are worth it.  But I didn't say foundry, you know, with battery.  I said the original one was a lot easier to navigate.  Oh.  This one, he needed another college degree to get through.  It's ridiculous.  And then did Steve then get in your face?  No, no.  He looked at me shocked.  Like, he just started, you know, coming on.  I mean, did you see it recently?  Did you see it recently?  Oh, did you see it?  Okay, now I remember this.  Yeah, I do.  Did you see it recently?  Sir, you don't know how close you were to being punched so hard in the face by a drunk, 
[02:07:30]  drunk Steve C.  Oh, well, dude.  Dion, I got to explain something.  That's what happens, too.  I've been working with Steve on this, too.  He gets very offended if you say anything negative about his website.  And I try to explain to him that on a daily basis, Anthony and I have negative emails,  negative calls.  Right.  And he can't let it get to you.  No.  And, you know, people think they can get to us by writing us a stupid email about how  the show sucks or something. 
[02:08:00]  I mean, we've been doing this a long time.  We've heard it all.  But Steve is kind of new to the game.  And he really gets pissed off.  And I try to tell him, Steve, the people that enjoy your website or the people that enjoy  a radio show or the people that enjoy, like, a hot sitcom on TV, they're not writing  to say how much they like it.  You only get to the people that don't like it.  You only get to the people that don't like it.  And that go out of their way to tell you how much you suck.  And nine out of every ten times somebody bitches, it bounces off.  It's that tenth time that really sends me over the fall.  No, it's that tenth shot, Steve. 
[02:08:30]  Okay.  That gets me enraged and starting to throw fists everywhere.  How about we all send Steve happy emails?  No, don't, because they're not going to.  No, this guy, the reason I asked him was because the latest incarnation of the website  that Jeff and I put together is modeled after websites that children can navigate.  So I was very curious to see if he had seen that one.  And that's where the confusion was.  Yeah, because the other website was a little complicated.  I was trying to find a video one day, and I actually sent a satellite out of orbit. 
[02:09:00]  Because I didn't know what I was doing.  NASA has contacted us about that, and we fixed it.  It's definitely better now.  It's definitely better now.  Yeah.  Thank you, Dion.  Thanks for all the boos, too.  You guys are out there.  All right, cool.  He's responsible for a lot of the crap that's going on today.  Let's hit John up here.  John, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  Pretty good, John.  Yeah, I was wondering, with your contract negotiations, are you trying to get the  print CD out to the people? 
[02:09:30]  That old gag.  Yeah, we tried to put out a CD like two years ago.  I've given up on the current CD.  I've given up on syndication.  I've given up on this radio station.  Explain why the drinking you're doing.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  One more thing.  Just tell Steve, I heard that they're coming out with a Harry Potter and the quest of the  Foundry Music website there.  All right.  Bye.  Thank you, John.  Very funny.  You know what?  God, I just must say something so bad.  Now, think before you speak. 
[02:10:00]  Unlike our own band.  I think I could say this without jeopardizing anything.  Okay.  We've been here three years.  Now that we have two weeks left in our contract.  Been here three years.  Nothing works.  Nothing works here.  The Medicaid doesn't work.  Now that we have two weeks left on our contract.  All of a sudden, they want to talk about putting a CD out and syndicating us and giving us  more money.  Yeah, now.  I've been sat here for three years. 
[02:10:30]  Three years.  Waiting for the company to, you know, throw us a bone.  A bone.  We got a bone.  Every time I bent over, I felt a big, fat bone right up your teeth.  I hate this claim.  Medications don't work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  For three years.  Nothing.  Not one bone thrown our way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, guys, you're a free agent, though, so what do you expect?  But all of a sudden, now, now, everything is coming our way. 
[02:11:00]  Mm-hmm.  You ain't fooling anyone.  I don't know exactly why that's happening now.  There you go.  Unbelievable.  E-W-S-A.  For three years, we begged.  We begged.  We said, look, look, we got fired from Boston, you know, on the top of our game.  Top of our game.  All of a sudden, we went out like James Dean.  Boom.  Right.  Gone.  Fall of flames.  It was a no-brainer to syndicate us back to Boston immediately.  We would have been successful from the first day we were at WNAW. 
[02:11:30]  Three years later.  Three effing years later.  Mm-hmm.  Nothing.  Three years of your life.  Nothing.  And now they're hinting, well, boys, there may be a possibility we can get, like, maybe an hour of your show.  No, uh, in Boston.  Oh, yeah?  Once a week.  Oh.  Not good enough.  Ah.  Better than nothing in a minute.  Ah-chay, ee-day, ah-chay, ah-chay, ah-chay, ah-chay, ah-chay, ah-chay.  What the hell?  We're talking about everything else, man. 
[02:12:00]  What the hell was that?  I heard him.  I know exactly what he said.  This amazes me.  No, it wasn't about you, Ben.  It was about paranoia.  Ben, was that about me?  The paranoia is something right before the DT's.  The alcohol poisoning is really messing with the brain.  Oh, where were they?  Where were they, like, a year ago?  Yeah.  Well, I didn't, man.  A year and a half ago.  It's got to be sad. 
[02:12:30]  Ah.  They're still in the office.  They were still in the office eating ice cream.  But we got the new man.  A lot of people are checking out the pictures on WNAW.com of our office.  And one guy wrote in and he goes, what's going to happen to your office if you guys leave?  And, well, the answer is whoever gets it is going to be able to throw one hell of a party.  Yeah.  Big party.  That's all mine. 
[02:13:00]  All right, man.  George, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, man.  Pretty good.  Everything's come full circle because I know how you guys used to do that pre-game show  for that three-letter league, football league?  The XFL.  Yeah, the XFL.  Well, I'm an XFLer because today was our last day.  Oh, really?  Yeah, really.  What was your part in the whole thing?  Well, we actually, I don't want to give away who I am, but we actually met you guys every  time you went to do the show.  I helped out with the coach a lot. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, I know who you are.  How are you, bud?  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  Sorry to hear you guys, you know, all lost your jobs over that.  Yeah, well, it just goes the figure.  You know, they screwed you.  They're going to screw us.  That's what happens.  Well, we kind of knew what we were getting into, but kind of thought you were going to be  in it for at least two years, huh?  At least two years.  Did you have a contract or something?  Had a contract.  You get paid for two?  No.  Wow.  Yeah.  That sucks.  It does suck.  But what are you going to do?  We just thought that, you know, you wanted to hear the good news because they treated you 
[02:14:00]  guys bad and, you know.  Nah, we're over it there, George.  Good luck to you.  Ben, what advice would you give this guy?  What advice would you give the XFL guy?  What should he do right now that he's been fired at, Ben?  I want to know where all those hot cheerleaders went.  What a stupid question.  I got the numbers if you need the numbers.  Even Ben's a tag bag.  Even Ben's a tagging Anthony.  No, no, no.  I mean, it's all good.  It's all good.  I love him.  I love the guy.  Hey, George.  No. 
[02:14:30]  I just wanted you to shake a little bit.  You are fired!  That's the one where before.  You know, that's what pisses Ant and I off.  You know, when NBC let us go, I would have loved to sit in front of Vince and have him do  that dark face.  That was a lot so hard.  All right, George.  All right.  Thank God.  Thank you.  Wow.  Wow.  James from Flushing.  Jesus.  Were you, like, following us on the streets of New York today?  I was just reading that instant feedback. 
[02:15:00]  Holy crap.  Interesting.  And it didn't come from Drudge Jr.  Yeah, I know.  Drudge Jr. wished he had that info.  Hey, Drudge Jr., James from Flushing knows more than you do.  He's a great source.  Go to James from Flushing.  All right, well.  Your office looks like the living room at Delta House.  That's very, very true.  They took the whole bar! 
[02:15:30]  What a goddamn mess today has been.  But we enjoy our nights out.  I got to say, everyone, for the most part, gets a wall.  That was...  All right.  Let's take a break here.  All right.  Oh, God.  I just want to say so much.  But you know something, Opie?  I will now be the voice of reason.  Okay?  I'm looking at my watch.  I'm looking, and it's got a date thing on there.  It says the 18th, right?  You see it? 
[02:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  You see it, Opie?  Yeah, I see that.  I think we became free agents today, by the way.  18.  Rumor has it we became free agents today.  I swear to God.  We're days away.  Days away.  Days away from things happening.  That's all I'm saying.  Just things.  You know?  And Opie has to shut up about it.  No, you're going to look pretty funny when we hook up at the bar in Huntington somewhere 
[02:16:30]  after I get done pin-knocking and you get done caddying, and we hook up for a drink and  go, geez, I sure effed that up.  Wouldn't be the first time.  No, of course not.  Bill's bar in Boston, I think it was.  Let me ask Ben.  Ben, what should I do?  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, what?  At this point, who the hell cares?  Let's just break. 
[02:17:00]  That's a Jager machine in my back.  That's not the solution to everything, Ben.  You'll learn that.  In a few more years, you'll learn that.  Ben, go and drink it.  Get a big fuck.  I can go and drink it, Ben.  I don't know.  Let Mike show his...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Please don't ask me any questions.  You're drunk, man.  Yeah.  Having a hard time.  All right.  We should take a break, huh?  All right, then.  Hey, while you're listening to O&A, I'm out throwing chicken wings at people. 
[02:17:30]  This is Jim Briller.  Take that up, you stinker.  Domino's guy, what's up?  What's up?  Are you in between delivering pizzas?  Yeah, I'd do so.  Hurry this up.  Pick up the Chuck Radio Simication Underground.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good job.  Thanks, Mike.  Who else?  Me.  It's the O&A Show.  212-757-1027. 
[02:18:00]  You can't yell the F word like that, O.C.  You can't.  I just had a dump, and now people that are hearing Guns N' Roses, all of a sudden, you heard  like this gap.  Like all of a sudden, it disappeared.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're insane.  Otto.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up? 
[02:18:30]  Otto from Otto and George.  Oh, so long.  I forgot who I was calling.  Like the E-Channel.  Hey, how are you, man?  I'm good.  I'm in Andover, Massachusetts.  Andover.  Yeah.  Is that your own stomping ground or nearby?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It sucks up here.  There's no drugs.  There's nothing to eat after 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  It's like pine cones.  It sucks.  Geiss was here a couple of weeks ago.  It's nice to know his career is also in the crapper.  What's going on? 
[02:19:00]  We're just ranting and raving today.  Half the staff is hungover.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It's all the half doesn't want to be here anymore.  Pretty rough night last night.  Oh, yeah?  Where'd you guys go?  Yeah.  We had a little party with our listeners at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Nice.  A lot of people right off the bat saw Otto and George, the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Really?  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for helping sell out Rascals.  It was a great night.  Bafo.  Oh, nice.  It was Bafo.  Bafo.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Nice.  We just wrapped American Dummy.  I shot with Norton on Wednesday, so that's finished.  Oh, cool.  That was good.  We did that.  And the Stress Factory is calling me to do a phone in.  You know, they go, it's a little light for the second show.  I mean, The Sopranos is on, so we're thinking of actually murdering a waiter on stage.  That might work.  Yeah.  You know, we're going to bring him up on stage and beat him to death with a lead pipe to satisfy,  you know, Soprano fans.  I'd go there and watch that.  Yeah.  You're playing Stress Factory Sunday? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  What you should do is just get a large screen TV and just promise everyone that you'll show  The Sopranos.  That's what I want to be doing.  I don't want to work.  Let's go to the season.  Season finale.  Yeah.  This guy, Vinnie Brandon, and his wife, Pam, love money so much.  They just, they call me everywhere.  I could be, you know, I could be having surgery and they'd be bothering me for these plugs.  Isn't that nice?  Annoying.  All right, Otto.  Nice hotel, though.  It's nice here.  It's just kind of boring. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Smoking way too many cigarettes, waiting for showtime.  Nothing to do.  Well, the city's cool, though.  You're too far out.  It's a great club.  It really is.  Yeah.  All right.  In Andover.  In Andover.  And after that, I'm going to Vegas and then I'm going to Chicago for the festival.  What festival in Chicago?  The Comedy Festival.  It's not bad.  Yeah?  The third year, I've done two out of the three years.  It's pretty good.  He had Eric Idle last year for Monty Python, so that was a real treat meeting that guy. 
[02:21:00]  Did he like your act?  He didn't see my act.  I just met him and groveled.  Please, please help me, help me.  Yeah.  The guy should have seen your act, at least.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  That's why I don't want to do radio anymore until the guy has seen my act first.  That was what happened with Man Cow.  I finally realized he just saw a guy with a puppet, and he probably thought I was just  some idiot, you know.  So, and it's better if they see my act first, and they think I, you know, they respect me  a little bit, you know.  Yeah, you're not just some goofy puppet guy. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  You know, they have a hard-on for anybody with a puppet.  So, you know, I figure, you know, he was kind of right.  He probably thought I was lame.  Nah.  But he's still a douche.  No.  Most of them.  You guys are fantastic.  Well, tell the company, you know, because they don't think so.  You know, you've got to wait for your contract then for them to start.  That's good.  That's how, that's, yeah, that's how it'll make us happy, sure.  Definitely, definitely.  All right, Otto.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  Have a good weekend.  Stress Factory Sunday, if you want to see Otto and George.  Yeah.  Come on, guys. 
[02:22:00]  Straight near Staten Island.  All right, Otto.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Well, you know, did you hear that story that he was telling that David Copperfield actually  is getting his own George?  Like, he's getting a new George, mate.  It's going to cost, how much did he say?  Well, I forgot.  Something like $10,000 for a new George, because the old George is, it's getting old.  And he's got this, the guy that made the original George is dead.  So, he's going to this guy, he's like the master, master of puppets. 
[02:22:30]  Like, he's like the guy.  So, he's having one made up.  And then, David Copperfield is a huge fan of Otto and George.  And he told Otto, make two, because I want one.  And, yeah, he's having one made, and it's going to be like in David Copperfield's house.  That's a little weird.  A little creepy.  Yeah, George, you suck it.  Where's Claudia Shipper, you faggot?  He'll start running around the house.  I know you're a faggot. 
[02:23:00]  Make yourself disappear, get in the coffin, you faggot.  Hey, guys.  How do you lose Claudia Shipper, that piece of ass?  Faggot!  You sick, Friedenroyd, wannabe faggot?  Ah, poof-a!  Mitch, what's going on?  Hey, Mitch, what's up?  Mitch!  Mitch, speak, or we will hang up on you. 
[02:23:30]  Mitch.  Whoever you are.  He goes, hey, man, I'm going to be on.  Hold on.  Hey, hold on, I'm going to be on.  No, you're not.  Hey, Mitch?  Mitch?  Mitch!  Mitch!  Oh, my God, get me something.  Hold, hold.  Easy, Opie.  Easy.  Easy.  Hello?  All right, how are you doing?  Hello?  Why didn't you answer when we said hello for eight times?  I apologize because I had to go away and get my little...  He is gone. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, we haven't played that sweeper in a while with that guy.  Do you know where it is?  The guy that wouldn't answer to his name?  Ray, what's going on?  Are you negotiating at 60% yet?  I don't know.  60%?  Oh, I...  Please.  I don't know.  Um...  No.  We can't talk about anything with negotiations anyway.  Thank you, Ray.  All right, thank you, Ray.  I don't know anything about negotiations, Opie.  That's the stance I take. 
[02:24:30]  I know nothing.  Nothing!  Then who is with me today?  Where?  What?  Who?  Me?  What?  What?  I was taking a dump, remember?  Go back to the early part of the show.  Here's a little what did we learn today.  I was taking a dump.  I think he partied in the office.  Marijuana is an narcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good and does everybody a lot of harm. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  Thank you, Joe Friday.  Stick in the mud.  He was a faggot.  Dan, what's going on?  Yeah, I got a quick question about...  A couple of...  A while back, like last year, you guys were talking about the A-bomb.  The A-bomb.  Are we going to see this A-bomb before you guys quit, retire, move on, or get promoted?  What?  Who says...  Who says...  The A-bomb.  We did the A-bomb, right.  We did the A-bomb.  Oh, I thought it was going to be, like, bigger and huger.  What?  Did you know what the A-bomb was? 
[02:25:30]  Getting the C-word on live TV is not huge.  No, I just...  I thought you guys were going to do, like, a vengeance thing.  That's...  No, the A-bomb.  Oh, my God.  All right, thank you.  He doesn't know.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's okay.  It's all right.  The C-word's the A-bomb.  The C-word's the A-bomb.  And it was on live TV.  Hey, Hopi, are you okay?  I see you got your head down.  You're rubbing your eyes.  You're shaking it.  You're like, oh, my God. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, my God.  I just want to go on record and say that I'm not hungover today.  I have other problems.  You had a beer?  I had a beer and a shot.  That's how much of a wimp I am.  I want to talk so bad, and it's killing me.  Nothing's killing me.  It's in everyone's best interest at this point, Hopi, that you,  O-t-shay, e-ve-ay, o-k-fay, o-p-yay. 
[02:26:30]  Right?  Right?  Do you understand plain English?  Let me see what Ben wants to do.  Ben?  Ben wants to drink.  No, Ben.  I don't want to talk.  He's just, ah.  I don't want to talk.  Do you have a beer, Ben?  Did you have one?  Drink with me, man.  What's the matter with you?  You're losing it.  You're not cool anymore.  No, shut up.  Don't become like thick.  Thick is sold out.  What happened? 
[02:27:00]  The best is, I got a stink the other day.  I told Matt Colton.  He goes, you guys want to go see the Sox Yankee game next week?  So I'm like, fuck!  You want to go to the game?  I go, stink.  Do you want to go ahead?  Oh, I don't know.  I got a bar night the next night.  You know what happened the last time.  You and Billy Mac are sicko.  Yeah, Billy Mac's worse than Ben.  It's like I didn't want to drink that much.  You'd beat me up or something, probably.  All right, calm down.  Oh, my God.  This place is coming apart.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Jeff. 
[02:27:30]  Jeff?  Jeff.  Holy ass.  I hear people there, but...  Jeff!  But they don't answer.  I hear like a rocking chair going on in the background.  There's a creaking noise.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Do you hear that?  Or maybe he fell asleep and he's snoring.  Jeff.  Hello?  Oh, my God.  Hello?  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff, are you on the phone? 
[02:28:00]  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Hello?  Jeff.  I think he's sleeping.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  He's sleeping.  Dude, he fell asleep.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen close.  He's snoring.  The guy fell asleep on the phone and he's snoring. 
[02:28:30]  Was that bad today?  Oh, I got to hear this, right?  He has been on the phone for quite a while.  For over an hour.  Yeah.  Jeff.  That is the funniest goddamn thing.  Just leave mine in the background.  Jeff.  Come on.  Jeff. 
[02:29:00]  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, Jeff. 
[02:29:30]  This guy can sleep.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Wake up.  Jeff, I have your daughter here, Jeff. 
[02:30:00]  If you don't cooperate fully, three men will rape her.  Jeff!  Jeff!  Was Jeff in the Hard Rock last night?  Hey, Jeff, because he's doing what all of us here want to do right now.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, I hear you starring.  Jeff, Jeff.  Jeff. 
[02:30:30]  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff!  Chuck just went through your house, Jeff.  Jeff, wake up.  Jeff.  For the love of God.  You're killing us.  I love this guy.  Hey, Jeff.  Jeff!  Nothing's waking him up.  Oh, shh, shh.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff. 
[02:31:00]  Jeff.  Jeff.  All right, we'll put him on hold for a while.  A-pooza!  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Whoa, man.  Did you hear that?  Oh, my God.  Uncle John, what's going on today?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Strange show today, guys.  I keep expecting to hear Rod Sterling start talking in the background. 
[02:31:30]  Isn't it just a weird-ass show today?  Really, really.  That'll be your full moon tonight, man.  Having fun, though.  I'll tell you that.  Yeah, I've been laughing a lot.  We had some good stuff today.  All right.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  All right.  I guess we'll just take another break, then.  I don't know.  I can't believe you.  Jeff.  Do you want to play Wake Up?  Let's wake up, Jeff.  If someone could do it, they'd win a prize.  Jeff. 
[02:32:00]  All right, hold on.  Let me put...  David.  David.  Yeah.  What's up?  Yeah, I wanted to play a new game.  Okay.  Let's wake Jeff up.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're on the line.  You're on the line with the sleeping Jeff.  Go ahead.  Okay, Jeff.  Jeff!  Wake up, you idiot!  Did it work?  No.  No, he's still asleep.  All right, thank you.  That's funny. 
[02:32:30]  Jeff is the anti-Antoinette.  Blue from Brooklyn.  Jeff?  Jeff, are you okay?  All right.  Jeff, time for school.  Hold on.  Bob wants to play.  Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Yeah.  What's up?  Nothing.  All right, go.  I want to try to wake this guy up.  You guys ready?  Yeah, he's on the line with you.  All right, go ahead.  Go. 
[02:33:00]  Anything?  I think he tried to whistle on the phone and it gated it out.  Jeff?  Ah, did it?  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  Thanks.  This is getting really stupid, so...  We'll take a quick break, and we'll be back, okay?  Okay.  Our listeners are so quick and with it.  Steven.  Or whoever your name is.  All right.  Steve?  Yeah, well, yes, you.  You just spoke.  Go ahead.  Talk.  You.  Yeah, me.  Yeah, what's your name?  Steven. 
[02:33:30]  Well, what?  You f***ing a**hole.  Oh, my God.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, she's very hot.  All I want to do is kiss the sex.  How stupid do you have to be to be on the phone and someone calls your name and you don't answer?  All I want to do is kiss the sex.  You f***ing a**hole. 
[02:34:00]  You f***ing a**hole.  Did he just lose his f***ing mind?  I hate people I don't get.  God damn it, that takes me off.  I'm a freaking lunatic.  You are.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, the WWF, they're doing Judgment Day this Sunday on Pay Per View. 
[02:34:30]  Ben, I'm freaking out.  What's going on out there, Ben?  Ben.  Oh, Billy Mac is here?  With a bottle of rum.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, my God.  Billy Mac is like the epitome of the drinker.  Look at his face.  Yeah.  What's up, Billy Mac?  I don't know how painful it is to get over a hangover.  And Captain Morgan, dude.  Come on.  Do we have any Coke in the back? 
[02:35:00]  No.  Oh, Billy Mac brought some Coke.  All right.  We are a half hour away from some icy cold Catons and Coke.  Judgment Day on Pay Per View, yes.

My God, what a day.  What a day!  Psycho Mark in the studio.  Jeff's still asleep on the phone.  Crank him up.  Let me hear this guy.  He's morning. 
[02:37:30]  The guy's asleep.  You know what he wanted to do, too?  He wanted to propose to his girlfriend.  That's what it says.  Jeff wants to propose to his girlfriend on the air.  This is it.  Here he is proposing.  Hey, sorry.  Sean.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  I'm a mechanic.  I got an air hammer.  You want to wake this guy up?  An air hammer?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something, Sean.  Yeah.  Aerosmith tickets did you get the job done.  I don't need Aerosmith tickets.  Send me a chase at Sam Adams.  All right, we'll get you something.  All right, hang on.  You ready?

[02:38:30]  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  All right.  Somebody...  Somebody's putting a knife in your belly real slow.  Pleasant dreams.  Kristen, what's going on?  Nothing much right now.  Oh, this is a Kristen that was on about two and a half hours ago.  You're in love with Ben.  You write poems about Ben. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, Ben's got a girlfriend.  Ben's got a girlfriend.  What?  He's got a girlfriend.  Licky, licky, fucking something.  Ben's got a girlfriend.  Oh, my God.  Ben's got to cry.  She's helping another girl.  Oh, la, la.  Oh, the feel.  Ha, ha, ha.  You got a girlfriend.  You know what the funniest thing?  When I told him about this crazy...  Wait.  Ben, you're not talking about Mike for five seconds without saying the end of it. 
[02:39:30]  I don't know what's wrong with you.  You are hysterical today.  Ben's usually so shy and reserved.  When I told Mark about this crazy bitch with her email...  I was like, give me a number.  Give me a little email immediately.  I'll back her.  I did, too.  I said I'd give her a reach around.  Oh, my God.  So, Kristen, why are you calling back?  I want to play What Did I Learn on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh, right.  Okay.  I learned that I should throw myself in front of a bus. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, throw yourself in front of a bus.  That, um, Jim Norton, if he puts on glasses, he will look like Ben.  Uh-huh.  And, um, I also learned that roses are red, violets are blue, and Ben's a faggot, and he can't have me.  You're a faggot!  Ben's got a girlfriend.  Ben's got a girlfriend.  He loves it.  He loves it.  This is Mark's highlight.  Slow news, St. Fox.  Hey, Ben. 
[02:40:30]  Hey, Ben.  Uh, Ben, she's talking to you.  You'll be the person going in front of a bus tomorrow when you learn what you passed up, all right?  And, um...  Ooh.  Dude, you're so rude to this.  Poor girl.  She writes your friggin' poem.  Shut up.  It wasn't about your two songs.  It was supposed to be a dumb joke.  Kristen, do you have a fiery red mane down there?  Uh, well...  What? 
[02:41:00]  You're a faggot!  You're a whole faggot!  It's all shaved?  Barewood floor.  You're barewood floor.  Yeah.  Would it have been red if it wasn't off?  Yes.  Oh.  Jesus.  Dude, what a dummy.  You're a dumbass.  Dumbass disease.  You're a whore.  You're getting some of the best.  I get the coffee.  It's so good to be here.  All right, Kristen, thank you.  Kristen, have a good weekend, okay?  I will.  You know what?  You guys have a good weekend.  You know, Mark, it's great this, Mark. 
[02:41:30]  Mark, can you go one day without Anthony's material?  We're in Boston.  How's that for a couple?  Walking down Boylston Street.  Can't do all appointments.  Don't drag me in.  Do you know who I am?  I'm a celebrity in New York now.  Suck it.  You tool.  Shut up.  How about the story about you being so friggin' hungover,  and he sweat his whole way up to Boston.  It looked like he got out of the car and he had a red shirt on.  It looked like someone threw a bucket of water on his back. 
[02:42:00]  He was sweating so bad.  I don't like to ride with him bossy the cow.  Stinky calls me.  Stinky calls me because he was so drunk on Friday he lost his keys.  All he hears is, boom, throw down, get on it.  You can't keep your mouth shut for five minutes in the car.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, yeah, at least I didn't get out at the rest there.  You're looking like a beluga whale that just came out of the water.  Dude, and then he goes into Dunkin' Donuts,  gets two of the biggest coffee coladas you can friggin' find. 
[02:42:30]  Comes back to the car.  He puts them on a roof.  All I hear is, oh, crap.  One of them goes right to the sunroof and covers everything inside the car.  My car is a piece of coffee.  I'm sorry.  Wait, you put it on the roof, they got it in trouble, eh?  I lift the sunroof up and I go, holy ass.  We weren't even in the car.  He put it on the roof.  He went to place it on and it went right through.  Right through.  Oh, I'm so cute.  I'm going to buy a camera and take a photo.  Let me pay Stinky and tell him.  You sure are terrible. 
[02:43:00]  Six-hour trip to Boston.  That'd be even better was your father.  You stopped every five friggin' minutes.  You would have been here.  The car needs to be fixed.  This is how cool I'm here.  Shut up.  You're so full of crap.  You're a pain in the ass to drive with anyone.  Oh, man, I'm smoking weed.  What are you going to say?  I'm driving back.  It's even funny.  I'm pageant Rick about something.  We're torn by a Mercedes on the way back.  Mark's doing like a BJ in the mouth.  So he's two chicks in the Mercedes.  They look like they saw the friggin' devil. 
[02:43:30]  I ain't never going to see the face so excited.  What were you going to say about it?  It was a good trip.  It was a good trip.  What were you going to say about Mark's father?  Oh, you should have heard of him.  I go to meet Mark at Mother's Day once.  How's this for a scam?  Me and my brother invite my mother to Sonsi, which is right on Newbury Street in Boston,  for brunch, you know, for Mother's Day.  So I get the brilliant idea.  Let's call her my ex-dad, you know?  Let's call him for breakfast.  Your ex-dad.  My ex-father.  He's the ex-father. 
[02:44:00]  So, you know, sure enough, he shows up, big thing of flowers, ah, and wah, wah, wah.  Pays for the whole thing.  I'm like, what a bonus.  Oh, nice.  So, hey, Ruth, all you out there, call the old pops up.  Oh, no, no.  What's your father what your father had to say?  I can't deal with the niggas down in New York, personally.  He's standing at the friggin' table.  I was saying, Mark's father's the funniest guy ever.  You know, oh, that's real good, Ben.  Yeah, my father hates eggs.  That's lovely.  Oh, and he didn't say that.  Shut up, Mark. 
[02:44:30]  And then he proceeds to tell me about throwing TVs out of the hotel window in Seattle,  trying to hit the parking meters.  He's like, oh, fuck.  Clear to God.  He's father's the funniest guy on earth.  Oh, they dumped out of that.  Of course they did.  You said the P word.  What else does he say?  Faggot!  Dump it, you faggot!  What else does he say about the black people of them? 
[02:45:00]  Oh, he's...  Mark's father is...  He's not racist.  He hates everybody equally, okay?  Oh, right?  I think that's fair to say.  You got to know something about Psycho Mark's parents.  His father completely out of control, like ten times worse than you could ever imagine Psycho Mark being.  He's Mark a hundred times worse.  Yeah, and his mom, the quietest, nicest person you'd ever want to meet.  And she cries about Mark all the time.  Who doesn't?  But his father said that Mark's getting a lot of tail. 
[02:45:30]  A lot of tail, right.  And Ben's getting a lot of man-hack.  He's dead.  He's getting a lot of...  You two are a pisser.  Dude, on the ride back, we heard Steve Mason.  Remember him?  We're driving through Hartford.  We're tuning in.  We go, holy S, that's Steve Mason from the Mason and Kowalski show.  What the S is he doing on the radio?  We're dying for him to give the phone number up so we can harass him.  That's our new gig. 
[02:46:00]  Harass the idiots we used to work with.  We did it to some other moron in Hartford that we didn't like in Kowalski.  And MRQ, what a cool gig.  Hey, how's your Sunday night show, dickhead?  Bag it!  Yeah, how's the don't job you got, you loser?  What you are listening to is our new morning show.  This is absolutely what it sounds like.  Yeah, our new morning show.  This is the next morning show we're going to try.  That's exactly what this sounds like when they're out.  This is when we go out drinking and stuff.  This is all you hear for hours and hours on end. 
[02:46:30]  And you just got to laugh.  Oh, my God, you too.  We don't even have time to play.  What are we learning?  Did I hear Jeff snoring still?  Yeah.  Did you hear Psycho Mark and Ben?  All right.  Hold on, hold on.  Jeff.  Jeff.  He called to propose to his girlfriend on the air. 
[02:47:00]  Maybe you have some comments about his girlfriend.  She's a filthy animal whore bed.  And you better off sleeping through the goddamn wedding, you fool.  Hey, who's running the promotions for the wedding, Dan?  Oh, my God.  I can't take this anymore.  I cannot breathe.  Listen.  You guys, it's crazy not to listen to our show for the next two weeks. 
[02:47:30]  You know what?  It's getting close.  It's over, Donnie.  It's over, Donnie.  The eruption is about to happen.  We're like Mount St. Helens.  I know.  The tide's going to blow off and kill thousands of innocent people.  Psycho Mark's jumping around like a madman.  He's like Monkey Man in India.  I'm going to give the rock and roll library the 50-caliber.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The cotton version of the 50-caliber. 
[02:48:00]  He just goes, I can't do it.  He's doing the best.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  This volcano is about to explode.  It's burping right now.  You just wait.  Mark, has Fox News covered Monkey Man in India?  You heard about Monkey Man?  No.  Oh, the guy jumping.  Running around the roofs and eating people?  No?  Fox News?  Fox on top with a report.  Here are Monkey Man live running and jumping around buildings.  And Dan's a genius.  This just in. 
[02:48:30]  Live Fox on top.  All right, Mark.  Oh, my dear.  We've got to go.  Sorry we can't play how we learn today.  I don't know who that cares.  Go, Socks.  Go, Socks.  Hey, the best thing in Boston.  We're up there, right?  Guess who's covering the Socks.  Who?  Fox.  So it's the Fox.  Socks on Fox.  How great is that?  You can't beat it.  Socks on Fox.  I love it.  It's a genius idea, you know? 
[02:49:00]  Socks on Fox.  Socks on Fox.  All right.  Whoever's running the Donna Mike show.  Yeah.  I want them to keep this phone potted up so you can hear Jeff snoring throughout the  whole show.  Yeah, that would be good.  Until he wakes up.  Let's see if he wakes up or not.  If he ever wakes up.  Are you going to do that?  All right.  The guy's going to do it.  Hang the goddamn phone up.  All right.  If anyone's listening, you can tell us when he woke up and went, uh-uh.  All right.  We've got to go.  I learned one thing. 
[02:49:30]  What place is about to erupt?  This has gotten way out of control.  It has gotten way out of control.  T-minus six, five minutes and counting.  It's going to take a few more days, but you just...  Yeah.  It's always bubbling.  It's just thrilling.  Did Dan have a great day off today?  I don't know.  You can't really tell when people take days off around here anymore.  Oh.  The whole place has been on vacation since they fired me.  Mentally and retardedly. 
[02:50:00]  You're all soft.  WNEW, my favorite station.  Hey, did you guys say that?  We're coming in at all the breaks today.  Make sure you get all your...  1027-WNEW.  Yes.  Yes.  Very good.  That's Jeff Snores.  Well, we'll, uh, I don't know.  We're out.  We're out of here.  Yes.  There you guys will speak.  Bye, Jamaican Mike.  All right.  Thanks to everybody.  for listening to this mess.  1 o'clock, BJ.  Mark, you were really good the last 10 minutes, but you know what? 
[02:50:30]  I've got to give props to Ben tonight.  Yeah, Ben did a hell of a job.  Hung over.  Ben intoxicated again.  Extreme.  Full-blown Alcatrazine.  First drink on Mark.  Alcatrazine.
