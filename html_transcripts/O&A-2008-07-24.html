<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-course into vulgar and sexually suggestive humor.  The show opened with Anthony's disdain for radio's "niceness" mandate, immediately setting the tone.  Jimmy's severe illness (potentially flu or worse, self-diagnosed via WebMD) dominated early discussion, alongside a listener's similar ailments and the complications of post-gastric bypass vomiting.  This segued into a listener’s upcoming colonoscopy and the ensuing “rodeo” caused by bowel prep, and a revisit of “No Filter Paul” and his antics, prompted by a listener's YouTube request.  Jimmy’s allergy testing mishaps, featuring numerous pokes and subsequent itching, were also discussed.

News items provided further fodder for off-color jokes. A lottery-winning doorman's lavish spending and his girlfriend's alleged past as a brothel greeter were dissected, alongside a female traffic reporter's wardrobe malfunction and the subsequent debate about her attire and career prospects.  Listener calls added commentary, and Christian Bale’s arrest for assaulting his mother was briefly touched upon.  The segment concluded with more on Jimmy’s health, new iPhones, a humorous exchange with a listener named Bob, promotion of an upcoming Laszlo Show, and the announcement of the show's cancellation in Buffalo.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of iPhone 2.0 software updates, app functionality (including one host's Magic 8-Ball app), and technical glitches. This devolved into a bizarre, sexually suggestive conversation about one host's leg-touching habit while watching TV.  A former Army medic, Rob, called to promote a Wounded Warrior Project fundraising ride, followed by calls focusing on iPhone software and storage issues.  The hosts revealed significant financial losses from their Citadel stock investment.

A significant portion was dedicated to angry listener calls regarding the Buffalo station's decision to drop the show, with calls coming from Buffalo and even Canada.  One host shared his personal phone number. This led to a rant about the perceived unfairness of tax laws concerning investment loss deductions.  The hosts then discussed Sherry Shepard from *The View*, focusing on her unconventional beliefs (flat earth, young earth) and past statements about physical abuse and numerous abortions.  Audio clips of Shepard were played, highlighting her seemingly contradictory views.  A born-again Christian caller attempted to explain the Trinity to clarify a point of contention.  Mike Birbiglia and Robert Kelly, both in studio, promoted their upcoming comedy show.  The segment concluded with speculation and humorous commentary about a Channel 11 traffic reporter, Jill Nicolini, and her attire, hinting at a possible relationship between her and one of the hosts and a subsequent reprimand.

A substantial segment centered on Jill Nicolini (Anthony's girlfriend) and her recent on-air blazer choice, speculated to be a publicity stunt, Anthony's influence, or even a pregnancy (denied).  Richard Huff, a TV columnist, offered insights into the industry and commented on female reporters’ attire and Nicolini’s potential.  He also discussed various TV shows (*Generation Kill*, *The Wire*, *Swingtown*, *True Blood*, *Mad Men*, *Californication*).  Robert Kelly and Mike Birbiglia (promoting their show) were present, leading to further banter. Sam Roberts’ “Primetime Gossip” segment featured a fabricated story about Anthony’s AIDS diagnosis and his relationship with Jill.  The segment included vulgar ribbing of Anthony and his relationship with Jill, a forced English accent on Mike Birbiglia, and a humorous attempt to confront a station playing Christmas music in July.  The upcoming comedy show and car giveaway were promoted.

A significant portion focused on Mike Birbiglia’s cancelled sitcom pilot. He detailed the premise, cast (including Bob Odenkirk and Michael Hitchcock), and his struggles with network producers.  The conversation frequently derailed into offensive and sexually explicit jokes, ethnic slurs (references to "guinea," "Asian"), and descriptions of sexual acts and bodily functions.  Bobby Lee's *MADtv* experience, including a pants-soiling incident and Vicodin addiction, was discussed, alongside “robo-tripping” among teenagers.  Richard Belzer's disapproval of stereotypical humor on *Last Comic Standing* was mentioned, along with Esther Koo's comedy. Mandy Moore's UFC appearance and Bobby Lee's “Kims of Comedy” experience were also discussed.  Bobby Lee's upcoming stand-up performance at Caroline's was promoted, and several callers praised the hosts and guests.

The show started with a discussion on the hosts' experiences with substance abuse and pre-performance nerves, including anecdotes about urinating in Starbucks cups and self-stimulation. This transitioned to a listener's account of Salvia Divinorum, a news report about banning it in Massachusetts, and humorous commentary on the news reporter’s name, “Joe Shortsleeve.”  YouTube videos of Salvia trips were mocked.  A call-in segment featured a listener's Salvia experience, followed by a detailed description of a bad trip.  Richard Simmons’ appearance before Congress regarding childhood obesity was comedically discussed.  A discussion of *Last Comic Standing* and Heath Heich’s Asian-themed jokes (criticized by Richard Belzer) ensued, using offensive language and stereotypes. Bobby Lee revealed he wore women’s underwear, leading to more banter.  Bobby Lee experienced a panic attack, possibly triggered by the chaotic atmosphere, a minor earthquake, and potential residual substance effects, resulting in his abrupt departure.  Technical difficulties, including a power outage and video loss, were also discussed.

The final segment centered on a prank where the hosts convinced Bobby Lee a rabbit was in the studio, causing him to flee in a panic. The show's upcoming schedule (including a Caroline's Comedy Club performance), its treatment of guests, and the presence of cockroaches in the studio were discussed.  Mike Birbiglia left, and the plan to reveal the rabbit prank to Bobby Lee the next day was mentioned. Intern Pat Duffy provided a closing announcement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Intimous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Hey, man voice.  Ooh, you're hurting me now.  Yeah, you know I am.  Grandpa, could you whip me up some ovaries?  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:01:00]  iTunes, Apple Store offers a slew of programs and games.  How about the game, Take Picture of Genitals, Send to Frank?  Now open your cheeks up.  I want to hear the sniffing.  Open your cheeks wide.  Wait, shh, shh.  My teeth hurt.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  We'll love it.  Good morning.  Just don't mind me hacking throughout the entire show today.  That's the type of show we do.  It's phase five of the tuberculosis show.  I went to WebMD for you yesterday. 
[00:02:00]  Did you?  What do I got?  You don't want to know.  You don't want to know.  Jesus, no.  Because you refused to go to a doctor.  You got this very rare summer flu last week.  But I've run into a bunch of other people that have the same thing.  So something is going around, which is bizarre.  I'd like to buy two vowels, an A and an I.  But what concerns Jimmy and I? 
[00:02:30]  AIDS.  See, I feel like I could perhaps have.  How did Jimmy not get an AIDS joke?  Jesus, you're immune to them now.  I swear to God, I thought it was a joke about that Spielberg movie.  Oh, A.  I really did.  Which would have been equally as funny, I guess.  Kablooey.  Kablooey.  I stink.  Jimmy's just waking up, Anthony.  Well, what concerned us was the fact that you told a story where you kind of just passed down your bathroom 
[00:03:00]  and woke up with your head up against the wall.  Oh, I was having fevers.  It was terrible.  So I did what everyone does when they have a few symptoms.  I went to WebMD for you.  I don't like that.  That's the hypochondriac website.  It's bad.  What is it?  No, it's a bad place to go.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't just say I went there for you.  It's bad.  That means it's bad.  It's so bad, I'm not going to tell you. 
[00:03:30]  No.  Go to a doctor.  No.  No, this is something that's just running its course.  I walked in this morning and you were coughing pretty good.  Yeah.  You got the cough medicine in you?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I just took a nice shot of that.  Yeah.  It's one of those things where you're sick, you got the fever, the whole nice thing going,  and then when you start feeling better from that, you notice you go, what cough happening  here?  What's that? 
[00:04:00]  And then before you know it, you're going, to the point where it feels like you're going  to vomit because you're coughing so much.  Yeah.  Well, I can't help myself.  I could tell you the best scenario and the worst scenario.  All righty.  Because I really did this.  Jesus.  Okay, give me.  Let's go with the best.  Give me the best, what it could be, like, harmless one.  You might be allergic to peanuts.  That's best case scenario? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  So that I ate a peanut and what did it do?  It gave me a fever and flu-like symptoms?  It just didn't agree with you.  And then the other one, but then it's everything in between.  Now, the worst case scenario is cirrhosis of the liver, to be totally honest with you.  But then I would have, like, what is that?  Makes you turn yellow.  Oh, jaundice or something like that?  Yeah, I would have jaundice. 
[00:05:00]  Something like that.  I would be all jaundice-y.  Yeah, well.  And yeller.  It's something in between, obviously.  Something in between cirrhosis of the liver and allergic to peanuts.  Well, thanks, Doc.  Well, that's why that WebMD stinks.  WebMD my ass.  You go there with a cold and some dumb symptom, next thing you know, you're panicking for  your life.  I mean, could you?  WebMD my ass is a bit of an...  Whoa!  No, it's fine.  So, but now you're down to just a cough. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, now it's that annoying cough that'll last, like, a month.  I'm looking at another little sick bear.  Steve C texted me and was asking me what my symptoms were when I was at the peak of my  sickness, because he, apparently, was in bad shape.  The bad thing about trying to throw up when you have gastric bypass...  Oh, that's right.  ...is anything above the gastric band, I can throw up freely and wonderfully. 
[00:06:00]  Anything below just gets stuck there.  And I just...  And the muscles are still, like, pushing to try to get it out.  And they're still pushing it, but I can't get it up.  Can't your stomach explode from that?  I don't know, man.  He's like a horse.  Yeah, they can't throw up horses.  He's going to die while he sleeps standing up.  He's got the colic.  He's sitting on the...  He's laying on the ground.  We're going to have to put the tent over him.  Shoot him.  Feed him a sugar cube.  Distract him. 
[00:06:30]  Crack his head off.  Here you go.  His lips just take it.  And we blast his head off.  Oh, Steve.  Yeah, he's telling me he had this bad fever.  I woke up...  I remember waking up in the middle of the night, like, sweat pouring off of me.  Like, literally like a faucet and just dripping off of me.  I must have thrown...  Thought about your sexuality?  Yes.  Every morning he wakes up and he goes, they know. 
[00:07:00]  It's just one of those shivery things.  And I just...  I don't get it.  And I can't figure out where this stuff comes from because it just...  That's what happened.  That's exactly what happened to me.  I woke up one day and it was Friday after Friday's show and I was shivering.  Yeah.  Like I'd never been that cold.  And I went into bed and I couldn't get enough blankets on me and I was still shivering.  And you get the cold sweats and you... 
[00:07:30]  It's awful.  And that was it.  Then the whole woozy head thing happened where it feels like you got a lightsaber inside your head.  Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, tell Steve to take two twinks and call us in the morning.  No, I can't.  I can't have any meat today.  Steve, why are you emailing me?  I'm not allowed to twink.  I'm allergic to twinks.  It said it on WebMD.  He emailed me as well.  Like, we're not doctors.  We're just shock jocks.  Because then Steve's like, I just got a lot of liquids that I have to drink before my colonoscopy. 
[00:08:00]  Will I be blanking blank all day Friday or should I stay home?  And there's a reason because I've heard you guys talk about this.  Because I've heard you guys talk about it not recently, but in the past, like easily in the last 10 years.  You both have talked about this.  I'm like, I have no idea.  I have to go for my first one on Friday, and they give you this jugs of liquid that you're supposed to drink every eight minutes until you just...  You're going to be in deep trouble Friday. 
[00:08:30]  When is the colonoscopy?  8 a.m. on Friday, and I can't even...  So you don't know if you can come in Thursday?  No, I'm here today.  Oh, tomorrow.  So you start a drink?  Yeah, I'm completely out of commission tomorrow, apparently.  Wait, did you start drinking the liquid?  No, not yet.  When are you going to start drinking the liquid?  Uh, hopefully around noon.  Oh, you're going to be in deep trouble.  Go home.  Why?  What does that do?  Oh, boy.  I have no...  Oh, it's supposed to clean you out?  Yeah, because the people that do the colonoscopies, they don't want to deal with you-know-what. 
[00:09:00]  So they want a nice, clean tunnel.  That's what they need.  Do you want to go through the Lincoln Tunnel when it's really...  When they were building it?  Well, no.  You need it when it's already built, and someone's cut the ribbon, and you can drive right through.  You want to be the first, obviously.  Absolutely, yes.  You don't want any of that muck on your windshield.  But being the first also gets you a prison sentence, so let's go with the other scenario.  But do you want to go through the Lincoln Tunnel when there's a traffic jam?  Or clear sailing? 
[00:09:30]  No, smooth sailing.  Well, that's how these doctors look at these colonoscopies.  So they give you this stuff and make sure it's clear sailing and there's no traffic jam.  No traffic.  Yes.  Oh, my gosh.  Lovely.  So within an hour, you're going to be running to the bathroom.  From what I hear...  Oh, even faster?  Faster?  Oh, okay.  All right.  I smell bit and other awful things.  Do not be anywhere farther than, I don't know, 50, 60 feet from a facility. 
[00:10:00]  50, 60 feet.  I was going to say 50 or 60 inches.  Yeah, maybe.  This is the stuff they don't tell you.  The doctor says he's going to give you a prep kit, but I had to start emailing people.  Prep kit's a bag.  Yeah, it's a gallon jug with some powdered drink mix in it.  And so I'm rapid-firing emailing everybody saying, what happens with this thing?  By the way, Derek is demanding Steve take a recorder with him.  You better get audio of this.  We still do a dirty show. 
[00:10:30]  That will work.  Dirty, dirty show.  That will be good for our dirty show.  Okie dokie.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max.  I'm wondering if they're going to have to use the wide-angle lens on the colonoscopy.  He's assuming they need a wide-angle lens on Steve because of Steve's presumed lifestyle.  Perhaps a regular camera wouldn't be able to cover all that area.  Right.  We're big fans of exaggerated humans. 
[00:11:00]  Of course we are.  I hear they're getting the Hubble telescope.  Yes.  I'm out of space for Steve's colonoscopy.  Actually, it's just a Polaroid camera with a mallet.  Let's go to Steve.  Let's see what Boston's all about.  Good morning, Boston.  Brian, what do you got today?  Hey, morning, fellas.  Hey, man.  First of all, Jimmy, you're great.  Boston loves you.  Oh, thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  Just one quick thing.  I've been watching the news lately.  I don't want to sound stereotypical here, Anthony, but what's the chances you have salmonella? 
[00:11:30]  I wasn't throwing up.  All right.  Well, I haven't done my research.  I didn't have a stomach problem, really.  It's a braundice, right?  I have to apologize.  I went to Brian because it says on the screen, maybe Ann has salmonella.  And I was thinking salmonella from Baltimore and, you know, that this could be a thing, but...  Salmonella poisoning.  Yeah, but they just spelled salmonella wrong. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  No, that wasn't salmonella.  All right.  Let's go to Charlie in Jersey.  Charlie.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How's it going?  Good, man.  I just wanted to tell you, this past Monday, I had the colonoscopy done, and the stuff that they give you is like a liquid enema.  It kind of tastes like a lemon soda, but you have to drink equal parts of water.  And I didn't realize that at first.  I drank it like nothing's happening.  And I read the bottles like, oh, I got to drink water. 
[00:12:30]  So I drank the water, and it couldn't have been two minutes.  A lot of bad things happened for the next half an hour where I couldn't even basically pull my pants up.  Can we play rodeo today?  Rodeo.  I want to play rodeo.  See if you can stay on for eight seconds.  I want to see who could drink this stuff and last the longest, and we'll call it rodeo.  Remember that scene in the Pope of Greenwich Village when he gives the cop the drink? 
[00:13:00]  They took my thumb, Charlie.  No, the other one, where he gives the cop the drink, and the cop takes it, and then walks out in the street and starts directing traffic.  Right.  And suddenly, like 30 seconds later, bang.  It hits him.  Yeah, that's what Steve's going to experience.  Well, I don't know what this means at all, but Sean, the producer, is saying,  suddenly there's going to be a bunch of condoms and dead hamsters all over the studio floor.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Tubing.  You know, why are you guys blowing off my idea?  I want to play rodeo.  Now, how would rodeo work?  Well, stunt brain, how do we get rodeo done?  I want three guys, and I want them to drink whatever that stuff is, and I want to play rodeo.  And whoever can hold out the longest?  Yes.  Wins, I don't know. 
[00:14:00]  I got 100.  That's easy.  What about cream pie?  Yeah, we could pick the guys.  Cream pie.  Bub.  Bub.  Young Bub.  What if we put three or four glasses and only one of them had the toxic mix?  Oh, Russian roulette.  Oh, that is hilarious.  Russian roulette.  That is hilarious, and you don't even know.  But you've got to make them all taste the same.  That's the way to go.  Well, I don't think they know what it tastes like anyway.  Well, if you have water, water, you're going to be able to. 
[00:14:30]  Well, water, yeah, but I mean, it's got to be something else.  Right.  Maybe like a, hmm.  Someone's going to have to do a little taste testing.  Like a Mountain Dew.  A malted.  They might get a little dribble setting up the bit.  We could make them all taste the same, so no one would know.  But only one of them's loaded.  Well, let's get this done for tomorrow, right?  I'm serious.  Let's play rodeo tomorrow.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Guys, I'm still having nightmares with No Filter Paul.  Please don't do this again.  Yeah.  We did do this bit with No Filter Paul, but we didn't play rodeo, though. 
[00:15:00]  No.  That's the bit, because now you've got guys trying to hold it out.  We played disgusting little English man in a diaper.  Yeah.  Messing himself.  Yeah.  It was hysterically funny.  That was so damn funny, watching him lose control of himself like that.  And that video's up on YouTube still, right?  Best be.  Can we get the search?  Classic.  What people need to search for it, if they want to see the No Filter Paul, we kind of did it. 
[00:15:30]  Jimmy, what's wrong?  I'm itchy.  You're itchy?  You all right?  Yes.  What happened?  What'd they do?  Allergist.  Checked you for allergies.  Yeah, it's just itch.  So they poke you with things.  Yeah, I'm sick.  And then they say, you're allergic to that?  You're allergic to this?  So when you get the last poke, so what, you got all the pokes?  Do you know what you're allergic to?  They said maybe a little histamine and a little bit of mold, but not much.  I got 40 pokes. 
[00:16:00]  Sure.  20 left, 20 right, and then 20 needles in the right.  They put it under the skin.  Wow.  Your skin popping.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  It's just itching.  It's like heels.  Oh, a little mold allergy too?  Nothing major.  Probably from that godforsaken crap hole you lived in.  No, he said it's all over the place, the one I'm allergic to.  Oh, really?  I mean, nuts today.  Everyone's allergic to mold for the most part.  Yeah, I think so.  That's a biggie.  He said it's outdoors.  You get it, and we laughed.  I was told I was a very allergic boy when I went.  Weren't you voted most allergic boy in elementary school? 
[00:16:30]  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Born most likely to sneeze near a cat.  From the dander.  I have throat polyps too.  Like, I have two.  Oh, no.  I have two little, though.  I don't think I need surgery.  I have to go get Frank the Frowner and stupid Ramone are going to be put on hold for a while.  Oh, no.  The new Ramone is going to be Ramone.  Ramone.  And Frank the Frowner is going to be, hello, how are you?  I'm frowning.  I'm frowning.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  And believe me, you're not getting any angry Vince out of me for a little while.  That stuff hurts.  God, we're all infirmed.  All right, let's go to Dave in Boston.  Dave, listening on BCN.  How are you, Dave?  Hey, not bad.  Not bad.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  I just want to get a message over to Steve.  Do not drink any of that stuff until he gets home.  And then once he does, don't plan on going anywhere because I had the same thing done last year.  And it starts working immediately, right?  I think it's, you know, I went and laid down and it was like probably 20 minutes and I said, you know, geez, nothing's really happened. 
[00:17:30]  And then there was this gurgle and then I was in the bathroom for a good four hours.  You know, it starts with the gurgle.  He does not want to drink that stuff at work because he'll never make it home and then, you know, he'd probably make the news on that one. 
[00:18:00]  You guys are funny mother effers this morning.  It started with a gurgle.  It always starts with the gurgle.  The gurgle.  All right, Dave.  Thanks, man.  You feel a little something moving in your abdomen like alien.  You just, what is that?  We're hitting our first break and I just want to acknowledge at this point in the radio show, we would be playing the pipe song from Brother Joe.  All right.  One of the many, many, many, many, many bits we can't play anymore.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Because the rules have changed.  You used to be able to talk about the pipe.  It's a great, great little song.  Could we at least throw that up on onaradio.com?  Yeah, why not?  Make it available for download.  I don't know.  I have to check it out.  Make it a ringtone.  It's all about what we were just talking about.  I'd love to play.  The internet doesn't have any rules yet, so throw it up there.  Then the fans get a little extra if they go to onaradio.com.  Yup.  That's what we do.  Try to make that happen.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:19:00]  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  We forgot to give out the YouTube search for the no filter Paul stunt that he did.  Back in the day.  Oh, is that bad?  Just throw in no filter Paul, and it should be the first item that shows up.  Him in a diaper.  Pretty much drinking the stuff I think Steve has to drink.  His most important contribution to the show.  Yeah.  So you just have to put in no filter Paul, and that's the first thing that comes up?  Yeah.  Brilliant. 
[00:19:30]  It's an amazing video.  Good for him.  The best part of the video is him in a diaper, nothing else on, with this awful English body  walking the streets of Manhattan.  Horrible.  Trying to make it to the other studio.  Yeah.  And then once he makes it there, uh, wow.  Wow.  Wait a second.  Okay.  Yeah, we're kind of seeing a little clip of it now, and, um...  Oh!  That is just...  People have accused us of faking that. 
[00:20:00]  What?  They say that, yeah, they say that there's got to be something in there...  Like a hose or something?  Pumping that out, because that can't be real.  Yeah.  I swear on my family, that is real.  That is exactly what you're seeing.  Yeah, check it out.  It's horrific.  How can you say that's fake?  I don't know.  People don't want to...  People see horrible things and don't want to believe it's real.  That's what it is.  Because they're thinking, who in their right minds would do this?  Yeah, and that can't... 
[00:20:30]  That could not possibly have really happened.  Sure.  Ugh.  Oh.  Can't watch it anymore.  All right.  Our favorite doorman is in the news again today.  The lotto-winning doorman?  Oh, I love this guy.  What's he down to now?  Probably, what, a million?  Well, what's the deal?  He won the lottery here in New York.  Won five mil.  Five mil.  He was a doorman at a really nice hotel, I believe, right?  Yeah.  Forty grand a year.  Oh, it was a Park Avenue building.  Yeah, he's one of those Park Avenue doormen who gets the big tips every year, and he won 
[00:21:00]  five million in a scratch-off.  And he said he was actually thinking about buying a place in the building.  But the units in the building go for at least five million, so they...  So he couldn't even afford that after winning lotto.  Yeah.  He has no clue how much five million dollars is.  No, he thinks it's forever money.  Well, first of all, you lose at least 40%.  40, 45%.  Yep.  In New York City, he's going to lose close to 50.  Close to 50.  So, you know, he's got... 
[00:21:30]  I mean, still, he's got two point...  Let's call it seven million dollars.  Yeah, but you know what you've got to do at that point?  Leave Manhattan.  Right.  You can't live in Manhattan on that.  You've got to go to Allentown, Pennsylvania.  And live like a king for the rest of your life.  That's what you do.  But here's the other thing.  Did he get the one-time payout?  Because that could be another thing that is going to screw this guy up.  I don't know how it works on this scratch.  I don't know.  Scratchy scratch.  Because it was a win for life, right?  It was a win for life thing.  But I think he gets the option to take a one-time payout. 
[00:22:00]  And I don't see any story that's covered that.  But he could get an annuity or just one chunk.  Right.  Probably about a million.  Well, Manhattan is just following this guy's story.  And, you know, he was making $40,000 as a doorman.  And he's been flirting with the fact, should I go back to work?  I think I'm going to leave my job.  And to the point where his boss is now calling him a jerk.  A jerk.  A quote, jerk, they said. 
[00:22:30]  That was on the news yesterday.  And then we find out that he's in Atlantic City at the Taj Mahal with his model.  His new friend, this model.  This model girlfriend they've been calling her.  Every picture has him with a cigar.  They're in a jacuzzi.  They're just living it up in Atlantic City.  He's just spending like a madman.  And we're just sitting here, back here in New York, laughing at this guy.  Well, now we've got new info on him.  You know what he is?  He's Ralph Cramden when he found that bag of counterfeit money. 
[00:23:00]  The suitcase of counterfeit money.  Just spending.  Easy come, easy go.  I had it, and I went with it.  That's what he's doing.  Well, we learn more about his new model girlfriend.  Yeah.  And a girlfriend of Park Avenue's millionaire doorman, Richie Randazzo,  reportedly once worked as a greeter at a brothel.  Sabina Johansson insists that she was not aware of the alleged prostitution  at Big Daddy Lou's hot lap dance club on the west side. 
[00:23:30]  The strip club's owners were arrested after it was raided last week.  Randazzo says he was not aware.  Joe Hanson worked at the club.  How are you not aware of what's going on at Big Daddy Lou's?  A greeter at a brothel?  A greeter at a brothel.  Did they make Jill cover up?  Huh?  What happened?  Did they make Jill cover up?  What happened?  Well, Jill was wearing a lovely top.  That was, oh, my God. 
[00:24:00]  What did they do?  You've got to explain, though, man.  This is coming out of nowhere.  No one understands.  You've got to explain this.  Well, it just happened.  That's so, well, we were in the office, and, of course, we were watching CW 11 news,  like we usually do.  And my girlfriend, Jill Nicolini, is doing the traffic.  And I was like, wow, she's looking buxom today.  She had a very small, tight top on.  It looked great.  Very summery. 
[00:24:30]  It was sleeveless.  Very.  A long scoop.  Revealing.  Yeah.  Very, very neckline was very down low on the cleavage and everything.  She looked great.  She was showing off her assets, and I don't know.  They put her in a goddamn blazer from the Friars Club.  What the hell did they put her in?  She's roasting smug guy.  It's a mom sweater.  What happened?  It's a mommy sweater. 
[00:25:00]  It's probably Linda Church's sweater that she brought in today because the AC is a little  Wow.  A little too high.  I was saying she's probably going to get in trouble for that.  You did say that they're going to make her change her outfits.  Make her cover that up a little more.  Or she's going to get in trouble.  I don't understand why they don't just let her wear outfits like that.  I think because they're grooming her to take over for Emily Francis.  I'm serious.  It's so obvious to me.  Well, she could still dress like that.  They wanted to show a little more class with her. 
[00:25:30]  She's a classy broad.  But those are classy, nice clothes.  Dude.  They just show, you know.  You're not going to get an argument from me, but they're thinking big things for her.  Jesus Christ.  That's what people are tuning in, though.  They're tuning in to see the hotness that is Jill Nicolini.  Absolutely.  And then they bundle her up like a Muslim woman.  They're going to put a little burka on her.  For onaradio.com, can we do a before and after?  Oh, definitely.  The outfit she came to work in. 
[00:26:00]  Definitely.  And what they made her do.  And show the difference.  Let's see if we can grab the preview shot.  Maybe it was cold in there and there was a headlight issue.  No.  No?  No.  Anthony nailed it.  He goes, she is going to get in trouble for wearing that on TV this morning.  I didn't see it, actually, in the first one.  I'd like to.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can do that.  It's very nice.  We can get screencaps of what she came in to work with and what she's wearing now.  Let's say hi to Jim in New York.  Jim.  Yeah.  Hey, boys.  Hey, listen, as far as that thing's an annuity, because if you remember, the guy had cancer 
[00:26:30]  upstate, and he looked for a payout to get the treatment, and the Lottery Commission wouldn't  give it to him, so this guy's living on, like, not even $5,000 a week.  They're only giving him $5,000 a week, you're thinking?  Oh, is it one of those?  No, I think you could take a full payout or a payout for half.  Well, this one is $5,000 a week for life.  But the guy had cancer.  All right, all right.  All right, I got you, Jim. 
[00:27:00]  We're getting more info.  Thank you.  What do you got, Travis?  It was a set-for-life scratch-off ticket.  Yeah.  So you get $5,000 a week, and the Lottery guarantees a minimum of $5 million, and I think they send  you a check every three months for $65,000, which is like $41,000.  Yeah.  After taxes.  Yeah.  How much after?  41?  Yeah.  $41,926 every three months.  So he's getting...  Oh, God.  That's not that...  I mean, it's a lot.  It's $160,000 a year he's taken home.  Yep.  So you want to figure...  What's the percentage he's losing? 
[00:27:30]  He's not losing half.  No.  It's...  No, he's losing a third.  Okay.  So what's that...  He makes about $250,000 a year now?  For life.  Or $300,000?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, but I mean...  Is it $20,000?  If you're hanging out with a brothel greeter in Atlantic City...  A brothel greeter.  That's good if you're a plumber from Belmore, but I mean, we're talking guys down at the  Taj Mahal in jacuzzis with fine cigars and this new model friend. 
[00:28:00]  I do believe she could be a bit expensive.  And what does he get?  He gets that $41,000 at the end of what?  Every three months?  Yeah.  He's going to be the guy at the end of every three months, he's going to be looking in  his couch for change, waiting for that next check.  He just has it written all over him.  That's used to work at Big Daddy Lose.  Big Daddy Lose.  Jimmy, you know anything about Big Daddy Lose?  Jimmy, you're our man on the street as far as these things go. 
[00:28:30]  I've never heard of it.  I guess this was a special lap dance place.  I don't even know if it was set up as a strip club, but you went there and you got some special  lap dances.  Where is it?  And some of the girls were doing some of that hooking.  It was on West 34th.  They closed it this weekend.  It was all over the news because apparently the Wall Streeters were very into this.  You know how much they probably wanted?  They probably wanted so much money.  No.  I don't know.  There was a $50 membership fee at the door every time you visited. 
[00:29:00]  Membership fee every time?  Isn't that a cover charge?  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  What kind of club wants you to just keep rejoining?  Make me a card.  Yeah.  Make me a member.  Come on.  I want to talk to Big Daddy Lou.  This is very inefficient.  Hello.  Mr. Big Daddy Lou.  Mr. Big Daddy Lou.  Why can't we have an online membership thing where we all take bus trips?  You remember?  Hey, there's a couple things in the news.  First of all, we got an update on Batman.  Batman.  His wife is beautiful, by the way. 
[00:29:30]  His wife.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, well, let me see a little photo of that.  Well, what do you expect?  Jesus H. Christ.  Right?  No matter who you are, you can't choose family.  It's amazing.  Your mother, you just can't choose your awful family.  And he seems like his mother is horrendous.  She's a clown.  Well, what are we finding out?  His mother is a clown.  Christian Bell was arrested for, quote, assaulting his mom.  Uh, and now we're finding out he did that because she has insulted his wife, right? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  But he didn't say he didn't hit her.  They said he might have shoved her, but, you know, even that's bad.  Well, what was the mom?  Now we need to know what kind of insults the mom was throwing at the wife.  Well, apparently, it looks like the mother and daughter went there to ask him for a $200,000 loan to the daughter.  I don't know what she wanted.  Really?  When he refused, an argument ensued.  The night before the premiere at the hotel in London, like, can they give him a break?  The night before the Dark Knight premieres, everybody knows Heath Ledger's going to run circles around him. 
[00:30:30]  No.  Your boy's going to be made to look like a fool.  I don't have any money, mother.  I am broke, man.  I am broke, man.  Yeah.  Leave him alone.  So that's what went down?  I guess.  I mean, there's not that many.  The details are, as we say, leaking out slowly.  I'm on Christian Bale's side here.  You got to be, right?  Yeah, yeah, you got to be.  Come on.  You got a picture of his wife there, Iraq? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, because I have a picture.  Nice color picture.  Blow it up.  Get it big.  Make it big.  Wow-wee.  Married eight years.  Married eight years?  Wow-wee.  Wow, she's-  They've been married eight years?  It says two-  Well, they met in-  Let me see.  Hold on.  No, it's not right.  They married in 2000, yeah.  Where's she from?  Wow, is she up?  Cutesville.  Gosh, she is-  Ho, ho, ho.  Lobbed it in.  Jimmy smacked it out.  Jimmy dribbled it down the third baseline and eat out a single.  Um, it's not surprising, though. 
[00:31:30]  I mean, he's a-  I would say he's a very good, famous actor, and he's also-  He's a good-looking dude, so.  Jeez, Jimmy.  I'm just saying, he's got a nice face.  Let's go that far.  You're like-  He's got a good body, so what?  He's got a nice build on him.  Yeah, he's a good physique.  Hey, Batman.  All right, we know.  I hope everybody that sees that.  When E-Rock told me, he kept thinking of Clint Eastwood and my Batman impression and ruined the movie.  You're just wrecking the movie for people.  Well, not by giving spoilers, but that stupid voice.  I don't have to do.  It kind of takes you out of the movie at times, though. 
[00:32:00]  Yes, E-Rock?  There was also the audience, too.  There was one dramatic scene where the Joker and Batman are face-to-face, just dialogue,  and somebody yells, F'n Jimmy, and they start doing the impression while the movie's out.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, I texted that to Jim, too.  Oh, that's great.  All I hear is somebody yelling, F'n Jimmy, and then they're just doing the dialogue themselves.  Oh, that's so funny.  Did you think Gary Oldman's character looked like Kreskin from back in the day?  Definitely.  Kreskin's got a reality show.  Does he really?  He's filming a reality show. 
[00:32:30]  Listen to this.  The amazing Kreskin.  We don't find him too amazing, by the way.  No.  We've had so much fun with him over the years.  He's developing a reality show to help cops.  How many crimes?  What happened?  I just can't see.  Look at what they did to her.  They gave her a blazer.  And a scolding, too.  They gave her a scolding and a blazer.  You're far away, Ed.  It really is more of a sweater.  No, she says it's a blazer.  That's a blazer?  Yeah.  Okay.  They made her wear a blazer.  I apologize. 
[00:33:00]  Put a burka on her.  That's what I said.  Just say screw it and put a burka on her.  Tell her to start unbuttoning the blazer.  Slowly unbutton it.  If I was her, I would just pull out the left one and go, you know what?  F you.  I don't need this.  You know what you should do?  Take off what she had on earlier.  Just put on the blazer and button it down to where there's only one button buttoned on  the bottom.  She's much bigger than this CW-11.  You know that, right, Ed?  I know you can't say anything, but she's got things, you know.  I think she should blow up her spot one day and just start doing a striptease in the middle 
[00:33:30]  of traffic until they have to go to that thing, that old school, and then it'll be all over  the papers.  Every other TV station will pick it up, and then she's Hollywood.  Yeah.  She's Hollywood.  And I'm not even talking about actually showing anything.  Yeah.  Just getting to that point where it's going to get really ugly, and they have to take  the channel off the air.  I thought I could be a kept man.  Yeah.  I thought I'd rock.  Eric made a good point. 
[00:34:00]  I could be like K-Fed.  Ooh.  Just, like, you know, wheel in there.  Take the girl's money.  I'm so outraged.  I've got to help you out.  Get Richard Huff on the phone.  What?  He needs to write about this.  He needs to write about this.  Steve, get Richard Huff on the phone from Billion News.  I'm in the bathroom.  Please.  E-Rock said she looked like when you give your girl your jacket because she's cold and you're  walking around.  Yeah.  Yes.  That is what it reminded me of.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  It looks kind of cool because you were just out on a date, but if she went to work, 
[00:34:30]  like that, it would look stupid.  Come back to my boat, Jill.  Yeah.  You look a little chilly.  We put my members only jacket on you.  My members only.  You're a beautiful girl.  Ah, Gypsy rules.  Gypsy doesn't always need the music.  He can sometimes talk quietly for a minute.  He's talking about the girl's bosom, Sam.  Oh, God. 
[00:35:00]  I watched the first Quimsy.  Did you?  The first one?  The pilot episode?  Yes.  Somebody sent me the...  How was that?  I didn't watch the whole thing.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a half...  Isn't it a half hour show?  An hour.  It was an hour.  Oh, you couldn't invest an hour without commercials?  How long?  Is it 40 minutes?  42 minutes.  But it was weird because the opening was different.  Like, it's not the same opening.  Well, because the opening was clips from the show.  Yes.  So before they get that for the pilot show, what did they do?  I think it was a couple of clips from the show that they were going to do. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, that's odd.  Really weird.  Clips from the odd couple.  Yeah.  Quincy operating on some gay guy who's screaming.  Doesn't know he's gay.  Well, he's eating a sandwich.  Do you have any new Gypsy lines we can just throw the pilot?  Well, that's why I always wanted to watch it.  But it was something about how Monaghan...  Because, you know, Monaghan's like,  Ah, who's the one who picked up the case?  And they're like, Dr. Quincy.  And they're like, Oh, nobody wants Quincy to get him. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, boy.  He's the curmudgeon.  He's the stickler.  Yes.  You know, no cutting corners with Dr. Quincy.  And they're having this...  It's about a girl who's, like, raped and murdered on a beach.  And, you know, Quincy goes to the beach.  You know, of course, coroners get that involved.  They always...  And immediately Quincy notices that the cop hasn't done his job properly.  Of course.  It's nice to see, Lieutenant, that you let people do whatever they want at the scene.  You know, and it's just...  Should secure the scene.  Yeah, yeah.  And Monaghan's like, All right, Quincy. 
[00:36:30]  You've got to see some of these.  It's just awfulness.  Oh, he's got his horrible jacket on.  He leaves a girl at the boat.  Not flat-ass, but another girl.  Not flat-ass.  He's barbecuing.  It starts off with Quincy and the girl.  They're in the boat.  He's got his awful...  With that stupid Henry Fonda hat and his members-only coat.  And she's, like, 30 years younger than he is.  Yeah.  And he's like, So where do you want to go?  And he's, like, naming all these exotic islands.  And then the camera pulls back and you realize they're in the dock because his boat doesn't  work.  Of course.  And he's barbecuing. 
[00:37:00]  That Quincy.  Oh, Quincy.  That, you know, the bachelor coroner.  Yeah.  Likes to bring home the female cadavers on the boat where no one can see them.  And really rail them.  And just dump them overboard.  They're so nice until they get cold, Sam.  A little femaldehyde finger smell.  Somebody wants to shake Quincy's hand because there's that one story of when he, like, picked  it up and there's a girl attached to it.  Rigor mortis.  You gotta watch all the episodes. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  I can't get it off.  I'm sure.  In time, you'll probably pick up some Quincy-isms, I'm sure.  But that's what I said.  Some more.  It was like, you know, Monty Ham was trying to be a flip about it.  It's an unimportant rape.  There's no such thing, you know, he's always, he's got a lot of passion with Quincy.  He's a moral compass for all of us.  Yes, isn't he?  I gotta watch these.  I love the haters out there that go, why are they talking about Quincy?  The show was on in the 70s.  Exactly.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  That is, thank you, Jimmy.  Yes.  I'm talking right now. 
[00:38:00]  It's 2008 and we're having a fun chat about the Quincy pilot.  Right.  Yeah.  It's the beauty.  Why not?  Jimmy makes Quincy very entertaining for this radio show.  It's not that we don't, we're 32 years late with everything.  You should know that.  Yeah.  We have four jokes.  We're well aware that most of our listeners have never seen Quincy, but it's, but Jimmy  makes it fun.  Here are our review of Super Train coming up.  All right.  Hey, we got some primetime gossip this morning.  Ooh. 
[00:38:30]  Yes.  Well.  Primetime gossip as we go to break here with primetime Sam Roberts.  We're back with more primetime gossip.  Controversial news has been buzzing around the entertainment world as radio shock jock  Anthony Cumia spent the first half of this week at home instead of going to work.  I was like frying in bed.  Yeah.  Just laying in a puddle of sweat.  It was horrid and it wouldn't go away.  Apparently he was sick with a mystery disease. 
[00:39:00]  Speculation has been running amok as to what his ailment is, but our sources were able to  uncover all the juicy details.  Anthony has contracted the AIDS virus.  It's purely viral.  The doctor can't do crap about it.  His mood was made worse this week when he told his Anthelini soulmate, Jill Nicolini, who  responded by saying that she didn't want to be around him when he was sick with the  fatal disease.  This made the AIDS ridden DJ furious, who responded by trying to throw her out of his 
[00:39:30]  house.  I'm like, just don't F with me.  I don't want to be touched.  I don't want to be talked to.  I just want to lay here in my own goo.  Then she says I kicked her out of the house.  Will Anthelini survive this latest monkey wrench thrown into the mix?  Only time will tell.  Unfortunately, time is not something Anthony has a lot of.  Stay tuned as this shocking story continues.  That's a good one right there.  That's a good one. 
[00:40:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's a great one right there.  I have to disagree a bit.  I don't know where they're getting their information from.  It's just as good as TMZ and the Insider and all those other dumb shows.  I understand, but you know something?  Primetime Sam Roberts has never once contacted me to get a comment from me.  What do you say about it?  I have no comment.  Well, if he contacted you, that wouldn't make for a good story if they actually  contacted the person and got the real info. 
[00:40:30]  Exactly.  This is what these scumbag shows and newspapers do.  Maybe primetime Sam Roberts needs one done on him about his mixed up race.  Whatever that is.  Other things.  Other things.  Yes, Jimmy?  Do you have any comment about the AIDS allegations?  I don't have AIDS.  I had a slight bout with the typhus.  The typhus?  I had a fever. 
[00:41:00]  You're coughing, though, still.  Yeah, that's, you know, the cough thing kicks in after everything else stops.  Then you get the cough.  And Sam's working on an update already, so we should have that in a little while.  Oh, is he?  Oh, yeah.  He's a busy little bee.  Oh, yeah.  Busy.  Did she get sick or no?  Jilling is sick, right?  Nope.  Oh, really?  No.  We're all worried about getting sick.  That's the first thing you think of.  He's like, don't get me sick, because now stupid Steve is sick.  But it's like, if Jill didn't get sick, maybe we will.  I was trying to stay away, you know, and not be contagious. 
[00:41:30]  Ah.  Past that point of contagious.  All right, we got to take a break.  Listen, Richard Huff from the Daily News.  We're going to give him an exclusive.  We got to help out your girl, Jill.  Mm-hmm.  We got an exclusive for Richard Huff, but he's on a dumb train, so we got to wait until,  I think, 8 o'clock.  What's the dumb line?  The end.  I heard of that one.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  All right, John Rocker.  Isn't that the train he was talking about?  Yeah.  I just got to act like I'm outraged, Jimmy. 
[00:42:00]  I'm just playing, you know, the good cop.  That's all.  That's a brilliant line, actually.  Got a little song for Anne as we go to break.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex, but you hear.  It isn't clear, but what we're searching of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV. 
[00:42:30]  But full-blown AIDS is HIV, but really full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry, I wish it was something less serious.  But it's AIDS.  You've got the AIDS. 
[00:43:00]  This Saturday.  I always fuck her out, Mayoli, and I say if she ever dies, I'm going to keep her an extra  couple of days and do all the fucking things she wouldn't let me do to her.  Obi and Anthony present.  Basically, what's going to happen is we're going to...  Get to the slowly unbuttoning the pants.  I need a little...  All right, well, we're going to take our pants off, and then I'm going to kick her ass.  The Laszlo Show.  She was peeking around a wall.  She was holding a handgun.  I shot her face off.  The Laszlo Show.  Saturday at 9 p.m. Eastern on XM 202. 
[00:43:30]  Want to say good morning to all the texters out there.  We've got secret messages going on with the Obi and Anthony show.  Texters.  They're in on what we're doing.  Of course.  Good morning, texters.  They're in the loop.  They are in the loop.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Hey, it's the Obi and Anthony show.  Are we on in Buffalo today?  Do we know?  Who knows anymore?  That's a bad situation, that Buffalo thing.  It's very, very sad for us, Buffalo, and our listeners, but we're going away in Buffalo. 
[00:44:00]  I think our future is going to be very, very different for no apparent reason.  It's just a money issue.  It's frustrating because it's not like Freed wants to take us off.  It's just, it's a money issue.  Yeah.  Go sit and talk with that guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to be just fine.  Our futures are fine.  Just going to be a different future than what we're used to. 
[00:44:30]  Hey, Bobby.  This is a very depressing show today.  Not at all, man.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Anthony's got AIDS.  He's got AIDS with a forearm, a little Jimmy.  Well, he got poked with a lot of needles.  For what?  Allergy tests and stuff.  Oh.  Once you get bit by a werewolf.  By so many needles.  Werewolf.  Yeah, Bobby.  I have video of it.  I don't think needles bug me, if you know.  No.  Let me see.  When they put all these little needles, I'm going to blow this up on the site. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  But I don't know how to do it.  Are those needle marks or those little bumps?  Yes.  What they do is they hit you with a bunch of needles and they see which one's like...  Stop panicking.  Jimmy has bumps on his forearm.  Look what he did yesterday.  Jimmy's got something on his camera.  A video of sorts.  He's showing Bobby the video.  Bobby's looking very intrigued at what he's seeing.  Those are all from needles? 
[00:45:30]  Well, they are.  My arms are such a mess.  What did you just show them?  I'll show you.  I thought you were showing them something in the bathroom or something.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I thought.  I'm sorry.  It was...  No, no.  I don't puke on blood.  It wasn't gross.  It's right after all the needles came.  It was starting to swell up a little bit.  And there's pen marks in between each one.  Because when they first stick you, she wants the doctor to know where she's stuck.  So she puts a little dash.  So you have these Frankenstein dashes up your arm. 
[00:46:00]  And then, you know, because I used to be a cutter.  When I drank, I wasn't very happy.  No.  Aw.  So I have all these stupid slashes in the arm.  It's just what a disaster my arms are.  They're just terrible.  It's fine.  Jimmy.  That's all.  I'm happy now.  From your silly youth.  Oh, you know.  I was a goose.  Yeah.  And then what do they dip like the needles in like peanut and then shove it in there to  see if you're allergic to peanuts.  And when she did, they do, it's like, what's the picture, you know, ice cube tray, picture  an ice cube tray, but that was like little poke things at the bottom and they put it on 
[00:46:30]  your arm and then you wind up with 20 little teeny holes.  Teeny.  It feels bad.  And each one has like a different pollutant on it.  Oh.  It looks like a retard bit.  Hold on.  And the needles barely go into your skin.  Yeah.  It's just a slight prick.  A surface.  And then it's like a nice graph of little holes.  Uh-huh.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm taking your story away.  You're right.  But I did the same thing.  Sorry.  You explain it better because that's exactly what it is.  It's like a little graph and you get two and that means you have 40 little holes on 
[00:47:00]  your arm.  Wow.  And then they wait to see which ones swell and they have the chart and they're like,  oh, pollen.  Yes.  Cats.  Tranny saliva.  He's fine with that.  Wow.  Getting to work early.  Allergic to that.  I walk in from you being a good friend.  Being a good friend.  Right.  And then she said, I'm going to get you in the needles.  You're allergic to obsessing too much about dumb things. 
[00:47:30]  I can't wake up in a year earlier.  This is for me.  I get out of bed.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, you come in whenever you want.  It's a pleasure just to have you.  That's right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Anthony.  That was such an ant thing.  I love that.  Of course.  And then they put needles under each one to see if it affects you under the skin.  Why are you wrecking our bit?  We want to tell you what else you're allergic to.  Oh, you can.  Looks.  Oh, that was just me.  You know what stinks about both of you guys?  What?  Is that you open the door and then as soon as you just shut it just to become friends 
[00:48:00]  with him again.  That's right.  Why don't you both shut up?  You let me in.  He's a handsome man.  Hey, come in here, Bob.  Whack.  I want to be friends with Jim.  I feel like I've been working out.  I got some gum.  You look great.  I saw you naked.  Oh.  What?  Through your window.  I've been watching you.  I've been watching you.  Bob and I work out together sometimes.  Jimmy works out like a little maniac, except when he punches the bag, it makes me want  to suck my thumb in the corner.  Why?  When you punch the heavy bag, you punch it like you were raped.  Like? 
[00:48:30]  Exactly.  Just the same punch over again.  Get off me.  Get off me.  Get off me.  Got to put a little whiskey on the bag.  A cigar coming out of it.  I don't punch it.  I just stand in front of it and I elbow it behind me.  You have to take the bag off the hooks and lay it on his back.  There's a man on his stomach with a bag on top of him and he's crying and he's kicking  at us.  I guess he's in shape. 
[00:49:00]  Let's work out today.  What's the matter, Bob?  You got a cough too?  No, I don't want anything to do with that.  I haven't got sick in two years.  I wash my hands and I take care of my masers.  Oh, I do too.  And then what happens?  Look what happens.  According to, you know, the latest, what the hell does he call it?  Primetime gossip.  Primetime gossip.  I have AIDS.  I was actually listening to that on my new iPhone.  You can listen to the O&A show.  You know, I was saying that the second the apps came out for it.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, you go to AOL Radio.  Yep.  Download that app.  And it's in conjunction with CBS.  So you get the CBS station.  We get our flagship station here, KROQ or WBCN or a number of other stations that we're  on.  And then you can pop it on and listen to the show on your iPhone.  And you're a big fan of listening to BCN after the show, right?  Yeah.  In my Mustang, I could plug in my iPhone right into my sound system.  And I hit the auxiliary button and now I got my iPhone on there. 
[00:50:00]  So I'm listening to BCN, just driving around Long Island.  So cool.  Unless the apps crash your phone like they did mine with the iTunes.  Oh, Jesus.  I love this.  It's nothing works for Jimmy.  Technology hates me.  It really does.  The difference between you two guys is amazing.  Anthony loves his iPhone.  That's 690.  And Jimmy's being very careful.  Wish.  Jimmy's being very careful and he really wants to trash this iPhone. 
[00:50:30]  I don't want to trash the iPhone because I know that there are glitches.  It's annoying.  But it's like, ah, it's so close to being amazing.  Do you have the new one or do you have the old one?  The old one.  I don't want to get the new one.  Yeah.  Why get the new one?  They didn't do it.  They, to me, did not do what I wanted to do.  Didn't do enough.  You know what?  For 300 bucks, who cares?  But they didn't do enough.  For 300 bucks, you get the 3G.  It's fast.  It's nice.  It says 3G.  Where does it say 3G, Bob? 
[00:51:00]  It says it right up on the top.  I actually hold it over so people can see it with the old iPhone.  What do you do with your old one?  I'm trying to get 1,250.  I gave it to a girl.  That's what I did with that.  You did?  I gave it to my wife.  I said, here, take that.  Take my old crap.  Jimmy, you should just get a new one.  It might solve all your problems.  Yeah, dude, look at that.  Look at how nice that looks.  You get a new one.  It's a little thinner, too, right, Bob?  It's a little thinner.  Mm-hmm.  It's a little.  Why do I get nervous?  I know.  Can I see it after Jimmy?  Yeah.  Well, no.  Don't give it to me.  It is a little bit thinner.  I like it better.  Let me see. 
[00:51:30]  I'm seeing how much thinner it is in my old one.  It's a lot thinner.  This is fine.  This is called the way the iPhone section.  It's the big guts.  Not that much thinner, dude.  It's not that, but I like it better.  You're acting like all of a sudden it's a credit card you can go and put somewhere.  I didn't think enough was done.  I downloaded the 2.0.  Virgin.  And everything but the GPS and the...  I'm not sure about this.  I think it's a...  I'm not sure.  Somebody will probably call up and castrate me for this, but I think the process around 
[00:52:00]  this, I think the innards on this is a little better, too.  To work with these apps, you want all the stuff, you know, I put a bunch of apps on here  and it works fine, you know?  Yeah, mine does, too.  All right, well...  Hey, Stump Brain is showing...  You're a little lucky little Italian, aren't you?  Stump Brain is showing me his latest app.  The 8-Ball.  Are we doing what...  What's the apps?  You want to do what's the apps today?  What's the apps?  What's today's app?  I don't have any apps. 
[00:52:30]  I had to take them all off the phone because it wouldn't sync and now iTunes doesn't work  and my computer doesn't shut down properly.  Oh, my God.  So, should we ask the Magic 8-Ball if it was the problem with your phone or...  I think so.  Oh, is this your app?  Yeah, it's a Magic 8-Ball.  Magic 8-Ball, is Jimmy's phone the problem or is it the new software?  What's the answer?  My reply is no, so it's not Jimmy's phone.  Wow.  And it could be, no, it's not the software either.  You ask two questions.  It's not as fun without that blue fluid that was inside that 8-Ball.  Yeah, but he actually turns his iPhone downward and lets it back up to get the answer. 
[00:53:00]  The iPhone knows what direction it's being held in.  That is crazy.  Jimmy, why do you have your hand down your pants?  My...  What are you doing?  Jimmy's got his hand buried down the front of his pants for some reason.  Sometimes I'm itching near my thigh.  What are you doing?  And it's not...  Let's just say this.  It's below any areas that would make other guys uncomfortable.  Oh, right.  It's on my leg.  I'm touching my leg right now.  My hand's on the front of my pants.  I do that sometimes. 
[00:53:30]  It's not sexual.  I'm just not realizing...  Of course not.  It's like you watch TV.  My ex-girlfriend one time, we were away.  She did eventually dump me.  And I was...  Oh, Jesus.  But, you know, it's fine.  You move on.  You know, you move on.  You learn to live.  But, no, we were away.  Like, and I was just...  I just fiddle with myself.  But it's not sexual.  It's just like I'm just distracted.  And we're watching a movie.  And she goes, can you not do that?  It's like, I feel like I'm watching somebody act out an addiction. 
[00:54:00]  And I was just fiddling.  Wow.  You were fiddling?  She was right.  Yeah.  But it wasn't like you were just doing where you were just scratching your thigh or anything.  You were actually...  No.  It was in between.  It's like...  It's kind of like...  Picture this.  Picture curling something with a...  You pick up a weight.  You pick up 10 pounds.  You're doing it to work out.  Yeah.  But picture you're holding a one-pound weight.  And you're not trying to work out.  You're just going...  All right.  That's what I was doing.  All right.  That's an extra weight comparison, too.  I went with a girl who used to just grab her boob and mush it. 
[00:54:30]  Like, mush it up.  Really?  Yeah.  But it was like a weird thing.  It wasn't like sexual...  It wasn't...  It was some weird psychological thing that she did.  And you'd look down and you'd be like, what are you doing?  She was just holding my cat and squeezing her breast.  It was just like, what are you doing?  She was like, I just do this.  I'm like, ugh.  Could you leave?  Oh, creepy.  Hey, this guy needs a plug.  Let's go to Rob in Queens.  This is a good cause.  Rob, what's up, buddy?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  My name is Rob. 
[00:55:00]  I used to be a medic in the Army.  I got out in November.  This weekend, there's going to be a soldier's...  A ride out from Amagantah to Montauk.  It's 62 kilometers for Wounded Warrior Project.  And if anybody wants to go online, WoundedWarriorProject.org,  there'll be a link to the Empire State Challenge.  It's for, you know, all of us and all of our guys that are out there.  You know, any injury from...  And they help us out from the second families get the Red Cross message about, you know, 
[00:55:30]  their service member getting injured, all the way to Lon, Shul, and Rammstein.  Once these guys hit the hospital, there's somebody there helping them out.  And, you know, it's a good cause.  And I know you guys got some power, so I figured I'd use a little bit of it.  There you go.  The website again there, Rob.  www.woundedwarriorproject.org.  There'll be a link on the site connected to the Empire State Challenge.  And any support, every little bit of accounts, $5, $2 from a couple thousand people goes a long way, man. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  We'll throw that link up on onaradio.com as well.  Thanks, Rob.  All right.  All right.  No worries.  All right.  Todd in Jersey, what do you got?  Yeah, I got a few reasons why I'm going to upgrade my existing iPhone,  because the major part is to have the app on the phone.  Now, you lost about a gig of room because it's saving that for the application.  So I have a lot of videos and stuff on there that when I travel, I watch.  So I'm going to get the 16-gig version. 
[00:56:30]  What's the naps?  What's the naps?  All right.  I'm sorry, buddy.  I popped you up with me, man.  How much space did you lose?  Yeah, this is good knowledge, actually.  It didn't work for me.  How much did you lose?  Well, it starts to have an 8-gig.  It's when they go for it again. 
[00:57:00]  You can't watch videos.  I don't watch videos on my phone ever.  Well, that's why.  That's one of the main reasons.  It was a problem with the applications, because for me,  it was some kind of compatibility issue.  Yeah.  Well, I had gotten it on Wednesday.  All right.  I guess it's done.  Yeah, the iPhone.  Come on. 
[00:57:30]  It's actually fun having you guys do that.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  I'm joking, man.  Yeah, relax.  We're just having fun.  I was trying to get them again.  Did they hang up?  I went to a rope in a fourth time.  Couldn't possibly do that.  That would be the funniest thing ever.  If somebody wants to do a segment about uptown here in Manhattan  and call it, what's the ips?  Whoa.  Dave in New York, how are you, buddy?  It's not.  It's fine.  Yeah.  It's fine.  By the way, you were asking the question about Buffalo. 
[00:58:00]  You are on, according to a computer stream of The Edge,  you are on there this morning.  All right.  So we want to say good morning to everybody in Buffalo listening on The Edge.  I guess Fareed decided to throw us a bone and allow us to broadcast another day in Buffalo.  Thank you, Fareed.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Stock price?  Thank you.  You're all knowing.  105.  105.  We're going up.  Going up.  We are going up.  I should have bought at frigging 78 cents.  78 cents. 
[00:58:30]  Long way to go.  I should have bought.  We got in at $19, my friend.  $18 to go.  We'll break even.  Taken all of my money that I lost.  Yeah.  And reinvested it at 78 cents and then cashed out.  And you would have done all right.  I don't know what you're talking about.  What did you invest?  A Citadel stock, yeah.  You don't want to know.  Yeah.  We were fortunate enough, Robert, to get in on an IPO.  You know what an initial public offering is?  Yeah.  No, but yeah.  You get in before the public can even buy the stock. 
[00:59:00]  That's right, my friend.  And when it hits the market, shoots up.  Your regular Joes can now buy in.  But we already got in at a lower price than everybody.  That's right.  This is only for the insiders.  It was $19 a share.  $19 a share.  $19 a share.  So me and Opie went hog wild.  Hog wild and bought up a lot of shares.  I personally did my research.  I saw other radio companies.  They were in the 40s or $50 a share.  Exactly.  And I'm thinking, wow, if they're giving us this opportunity to get in at $19 a share, 
[00:59:30]  you got to go for it and take your entire bank account and shove it into this thing.  Of course.  It never went higher than $19.  I think it went to $21 for a day or two.  For the most part, it's been below $19 ever since we bought this thing.  And today it's trading at the fine price of what?  It was close to $105 yesterday.  $105?  $105?  No.  Oh, that's right.  $105.  $105.  Oh, not $105?  No.  No.  $1.05 from $19 a share. 
[01:00:00]  And we bought a few shares there, Bobby.  But you guys kind of invested in yourselves.  Yeah.  Maybe you make a good point.  That reason alone, they should keep us on in Buffalo.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  What did you lose?  Like a couple hundred bucks?  Oof.  A couple hundred.  Bobby, I will write down how much for you. 
[01:00:30]  There's your lifetime chart, Bob.  There you go.  This is what I lost on the stock.  Oh, yeah.  See, I didn't look at that.  Yeah.  That's how much I went in.  That's a comma.  Wow.  There's a comma in there.  There's a comma in it.  There's also a house.  And there's the same amount of numbers in front of the comma as there is behind the comma.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  And there's no decimal points.  No.  That's not good.  What do you do with that? 
[01:01:00]  I'll invest my money back.  Yeah.  It's called a write-off if you really need it at some point.  They try to make you feel better by saying, yeah, you could write this off.  For a country?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  I could actually dump it at this horrific price and just use it as a write-off at the  end of the year and just go, you know something?  That's what we're going to have to do.  Here we are.  He's posting a one-time launch.  Yeah.  Oh, well, you could do that.  If you dump stock and...  Government allows you that. 
[01:01:30]  A horse with a clock in its stomach.  One skinny chicken.  I'm going to laugh at you.  Let's take one more from Buffalo.  Dave in Buffalo, New York.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, are they actually talking about taking you guys off the air?  Yeah.  After they told us that we were going to stay on in Buffalo until at least January and  we were losing Syracuse, just giving the update to everybody.  Then out of nowhere, they said, actually, we're now going to put you back on in Syracuse,  which hasn't happened yet, and they're going to take us off of Buffalo, which... 
[01:02:00]  That's going to cause like a riot out here.  There's so many people racking the wild stickers, it ain't even funny.  I honestly don't understand it.  I mean, to be fair, when we get kicked off some of these cities and markets, we understand,  all right, the show's just not working in this city or whatever, but we know it's working  in Buffalo and we don't get the logic in taking us off the air.  They said it's some kind of cost-cutting move or whatever.  It's complete BS.  They don't have a plan.  They're just going to put a jock on in the mornings or something like that, and they're 
[01:02:30]  just going to spin tunes.  They might put Shred and Reagan back in mornings, which, you know, that obviously would be a  good move, but then they lose the strong afternoon show, so it doesn't make any sense.  And then they throw us a ball, and they're like, good news, you guys will be on in Buffalo  until Friday.  What's the difference?  Pull the plug now!  Why don't we wait until Friday?  Who knows?  Something's going to happen.  Don't patronize us and just like say, oh, good news, you get to stay on for a lousy  few more days. 
[01:03:00]  Do you think your stock will go up if you stay on until Friday in Buffalo?  A lot of people at the station are not happy about the decision.  You never know what'll happen.  Let's just ride it out.  Yeah, I understand.  That's it.  They like you guys out here.  We get you all the way to Erie, Pennsylvania.  Because I know they're hearing it up there from the listeners.  They're getting emails and calls and stuff.  Well, I just want to make sure people understand that we're not happy about this. 
[01:03:30]  No, of course not.  We really like the Buffalo market.  Other markets are like, whatever.  We were never going to go there anyway.  We don't care.  But this one we have a history with for many years.  I want to do a gig in Buffalo.  I haven't been there in years.  By the way, before I forget, I have a phone number that you can call for messages and  updates.  And I do return some calls and all that stuff.  It's 917-267-2602.  That's my real number.  I've been giving it out.  And fans leave messages.  And you can check them on MySpace and just listen to fan messages.  Some of them are really funny.  That's your phone?  You just give out your phone?  Yeah.  It's a weird thing.  I check messages there. 
[01:04:00]  I just call and people get notified that I left a message.  And I can listen to them or I can call them back if I want to.  Can we do a segment?  Messages to Jimmy or something?  Oh, I did say one.  Patty.  We've got to play some of these.  Patty?  Yeah, Patty left me one.  I downloaded these.  They're so easy to download when I went to the admin side.  And it's so easy to download.  I downloaded Patty's.  And there's like a couple thousand of them already.  Why aren't you bringing these in?  I forget.  They would be great for the radio show. 
[01:04:30]  In the morning, I'd pose.  Aw.  They were doing a pose off.  I'd just totally forget.  But yeah, Patty left me one.  I happened to hear it.  It was just, this is your friend Pat.  This is Pat.  Bring a message to me.  My Jimmy.  Messages to Jimmy.  It's a new segment we could do.  That's easy.  That's easy.  Let's say hi to Norm in Rhode Island.  Norm.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up, buddy?  Love you, Jimmy.  Hey.  Thank you.  I hate to tell you guys, but your losses, I work for a CPA firm. 
[01:05:00]  You can only take three grand a year after you offset your gains.  So you basically get to take losses for the rest of your natural life if it doesn't improve.  Wait, I can only take a loss of $3,000 on that.  That doesn't make any sense.  I bet you he's wrong because he used to work for a CEO.  I bet you it's only if you're on the board of that company.  This way you can't make decisions.  It doesn't make any sense.  We're going to have to find out.  There are people, I know there are people that take huge tax deductions from huge losses. 
[01:05:30]  Get out of here.  There are people that lose millions.  What, do they sit there and have to wait 20,000 years to write off that?  Shut up.  Thank you.  I was actually trying to discuss it rationally, and then I just had to say, shut up.  That's the end of knowledge right there.  Right, right.  It's just the end of reason.  You think you've got a good point to make, and then it ends up, no, just shut up.  Shut up. 
[01:06:00]  Steve in Canada, what's up, buddy?  Hey, man, what's going on?  Hey.  I just want you guys to know, sorry, excuse me, we love you guys up here.  You're pretty big up here as well.  You get a lot of listeners out of Buffalo up here because we've got no Canadian states.  I think Toronto should carry you guys.  See, so we lose part of Canada, too, because we lose the Buffalo.  Buffalo's a really important station for us because, yeah, it goes into Canada pretty far,  and we've got a nice following there.  Yeah.  Thanks.  I ran into a fan in an elevator going up from the Maid of the Mist at the Falls. 
[01:06:30]  They're listening over there.  I'm from St. Catharines, which is just near Buffalo.  Yeah.  But I'm a trucker, and I travel into Toronto a lot.  You guys carry all the way into Toronto from Buffalo.  So you're the station for Buffalo.  And what's confusing is we listen to you guys so much up here, but my buddy has XM.  But because of this merger, he doesn't know what he should be doing with his XM radio,  so he's kind of at a loss listening to you guys.  Yeah.  I say just keep it, and whatever happens, they'll work it out.  They're going to have units available. 
[01:07:00]  You can get both, I think, within a year.  It'll work out, dude.  Just keep your XM or keep your serious.  Hopefully we'll know more in the coming days.  Yeah, they'll figure it out.  They don't want to lose anybody.  Yeah, let's go to Sean in Buffalo.  Sean.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Come on.  Love you, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  Listen, me talking about this up here, I didn't even hear about this until you guys mentioned it.  Now they're going to take it up here.  You know, when they moved Shred and Reagan to the afternoons, that kind of screwed everybody up.  A lot of people, and me included, didn't listen to you guys before then. 
[01:07:30]  But now I love you, and I'm not the only one.  There's a lot of people that got to be pissed off that you guys are leaving, and I just want whoever listens to these shows and does these ratings or makes these decisions to know they're making a wrong decision.  What are they going to do with Shred and Reagan?  Are they going to push them back in the morning?  I don't know.  I really don't know what they have planned, but I mean, I heard that they don't have much of a plan.  It's a cost-cutting move, I was told.  And I'm changing the format here on us, too.  All of a sudden, they're slipping back into the old Rush songs and stuff like that. 
[01:08:00]  From the 70s and 80s, they've been mixing into the format, and it's like, you know, it's just disappointing.  You get used to a radio station and morning shows.  You guys are great, you know, and we're going to lose you right when we're getting into this, you know.  This one just doesn't make sense to me.  I've got to be honest.  It's really, really frustrating.  I'm losing sleep at night thinking about it, because we really like the Buffalo market.  We've had one of our most legendary things happen in Buffalo.  Yeah, we've talked about that. 
[01:08:30]  The T&A with O&A.  Ad nauseam.  And then shortly after that, you got fired and banned from radio and everything, and you finally get, you know, you come back to get to here in Buffalo.  They change our listening schedules around, you know, and now they're going to do it again, you know.  Well, no one's talking to us.  What's the reasoning behind this?  No one's talking to us from the company.  I don't know.  So, you know, we used to be able to talk to Fareed and talk things out, but I don't know.  He's in another place these days, I guess.  I don't know.  Well, we're keeping our fingers crossed that something will happen with us in Buffalo, whether we stay on this station, which I don't think is possible, or maybe we find, you know, a new home. 
[01:09:00]  So, thank you, Sean.  I appreciate the support.  It's good.  All right.  Let's go to Matt in Buffalo.  We can take these calls all morning.  Yep.  We'll move on in a second here, but Matt.  What's going on, guys?  Good morning to you.  Good morning.  Yeah, it's just, it's a stupid move that they're taking you guys off the edge.  It doesn't affect me because, well, I'm proud to say it. 
[01:09:30]  I only got XM because of you guys.  Oh, thank you.  You guys all the way to noon and a little bit of Ron and Fred from noon to three.  Right.  And I just, I love you guys.  Jimmy, I, you know, you're probably one of the funniest comedians I've ever heard.  I appreciate it.  I put you up there next to, you know, Richard, Jenny, and all them.  Thank you.  I'm sure we'll wind up the same way.  Richard, Jenny.  That's exactly where you should be next to him.  I got to tell you what was going on in Jimmy's mind. 
[01:10:00]  I put you right up there, and Jimmy's like, prior, prior, prior, prior, prior, prior, prior, George, Carly, Carly, Carly, Carly.  You went to Jenny on him.  You went to a hair-plugged comic from television.  We don't want to beat up Jenny because he's not with us anymore, and he had a fine career, but I swear, Jimmy was really open to be a...  Oh, that made me so happy just to see his eyebrows go back down.  Prior, I wouldn't have believed prior.  I never would.  I would just take that as a polite compliment you give. 
[01:10:30]  But, of course, every comic.  Yeah.  I heard Richard.  Yeah.  And I was like, uh-huh.  Richard.  Dawson.  And then they went back down.  Richard Dawson.  Richard Dawson.  Yes.  That's all I do in my act is I just kiss people.  Hello, love.  Hello.  Come here, you love.  Jimmy, I got to be honest.  I told you, I was hoping, I was praying he was going to go a lot lower.  Yonk off, smear it off or something.  Give you a good smash.  Put you right up there with Gallagher.  You watermelon smashing ass.  Hey, it's his birthday today. 
[01:11:00]  Whose?  Gallagher.  Why don't you relax with that?  The real one.  He's 62.  Hey, listen, all right?  Enough with the turning on me.  Just go with the flow, jackass.  I'm really getting sick of his mushiness.  Well, you know what could have been worse?  He could have said you're right up there with Bob Kelly.  Ooh.  Oh.  See that?  I would never do that one.  You know what?  Now we need to stop this.  Because this is getting hurtful.  What do I not have feelings?  Richard Jenny was a great comic, man.  I worked with him.  I only worked with him. 
[01:11:30]  I did a weekend with him once in North Carolina.  Yeah.  And that bastard was funny, man.  I just watched him in off.  I mean, I was newer back then.  And just to watch a real headliner work.  He was a real nice guy.  Real, like, over nice.  So nice that you're thinking, like, is this guy messing with me?  Really?  Yeah.  He came up to me in the laugh factory.  And he was just like, hey, man.  I just wanted to talk.  And I left because I got uncomfortable.  Sounds lonely.  He didn't like you, actually.  Huh?  That's hilarious.  Because you know I'm going to be at my house later going, really?  Did he not like me?  My father never liked you. 
[01:12:00]  We went to war together.  We played golf together.  Yeah.  Let's think about it, Matt.  We've got to take a break.  RobertKelleyLive.com is in the studio.  I just got to say something quick.  We got a lot of phone calls from people that said, I'm a CPA.  The limit is $3,000.  Yeah.  I would love this to make a windfall on a stock.  Cash in.  Get all the money from it.  And then when the government wants their capital gains tax, give them $3,000 and say, you'll  get another $3,000 next year, you sons of bitches. 
[01:12:30]  How come if I lose money, I can only claim $3,000 in the loss in one year?  But if I make a huge killing in the market, I got to give the government half of it right  away.  What a load of crap.  What is the reason?  Revolution!  Just remember this day.  That's all I want.  God.  Just remember this is the day it happened.  I'm honest, please.  To a fault.  This is when you built the lean-to out in the woods. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  You took all your guns.  You started recruiting little young O&Hs.  I'm just sick of it.  It's ridiculous.  None of it makes sense.  It's all just to screw everybody.  You're just getting screwed.  You work your ass off.  You're a 50-50 partner with the government.  They tax what you make, and then when you buy something, then you tax it again.  You put it in the bank to make a little money off of that, and that's taxed.  Tax, tax, tax.  How did they get that one done?  You bring up a great one. 
[01:13:30]  You take the money after taxes.  You put it in a bank account to save for your future, and then they take money away from  your interest.  Yeah.  They tax your interest.  They tax your interest.  That money was already taxed.  Everything's been taxed.  The second you tax my paycheck, then I'm done.  I should be done.  Whatever's left should be mine.  I shouldn't have to pay tax with whatever the frig I want to do with it anymore.  They can't keep their disgusting hands out of your pockets. 
[01:14:00]  Always.  They can't stop.  I know.  They tax every dollar you spend.  You've got to pay tax on every...  I mean, I understand we've got to keep the police and the EMS and the fire department.  But we have to pay taxes.  The roads and the fire.  I mean, everyone.  You know something?  Take a look at the waste that's going on, then.  Don't just keep taxing the crap out of the American people.  Look at the complete waste of money that the bureaucracy is just rifling through. 
[01:14:30]  Like what?  Like what?  How about something like that?  We've got to take a God-effing break.  When we come back.  Yeah, let's get into this a little bit.  I mean, Anthony brings up a great point, but we're just late as far as a break goes.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Really fast to Buffalo because we are going to move on.  But we could be taking calls like that all morning long.  There will be other ways to listen to us.  We told you about the iPhone thing.  That's blowing up where you can listen to radio stations from all over the country.  Jimmy's is literally blowing up.  Smoking and exploding.  We know this is possible with the iPhone. 
[01:15:00]  Is it happening with other phones as well?  We'll tell you about it.  I don't know.  The 3G network.  All the 3G phones.  They don't have that stuff.  And also...  It's true.  Gay, gay, gay.  You know my middle name.  And also we're still on XM Satellite Radio.  Because, I mean, the hardcore people listening in Buffalo, they're going to want to continue listening to the show.  There's a couple options right there.  We'll continue.  Moving right along with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:15:30]  We're all in a bad mood because we just started talking about taxes.  Stunt brains looking up taxes and all the things we get taxed on.  And it's ridiculous.  It's just crazy.  It's because I was talking about our Citadel stock.  And how we had paid a lot of money for it at $19 a share.  It's now down to a dollar a share or thereabouts.  And I'd love to be able to sell it and then use the whole thing as a tax write-off. 
[01:16:00]  But I'm told I can only get $3,000 a year or offset any gains I had made using the losses.  But it just doesn't make any sense because if I hit on the stock market and got some money, I can't tell the government, I'll send you $3,000 for capital gains tax.  And next year I'll give you another $3,000 until I give you what you say you want, which is about half. 
[01:16:30]  It's just the tax structure in this country is so unfair and it's gotten so bad over the years and we do nothing about it.  We're held hostage, really.  People are even on PalTalk, they're popping up here going, Ant, shut up, shut up.  See, they're intimidated and scared to even talk about it.  Think about that. 
[01:17:00]  It's gotten to the point where people are scared to talk about it.  I can understand if you're, you know, screwing around with your books and stuff.  Yeah.  Believe me, I'm angry because I pay my frigging taxes.  That's why I'm angry.  It's a ridiculous amount.  It's multiple taxing on the same thing, on the same money.  You get paid, it's taxed.  All right, enough.  I go to the store, I use my taxed money to buy something and I got to pay tax again. 
[01:17:30]  How is that?  How is that fair?  How is that even fair?  By the way, this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, Greg.  I love paying taxes.  Just wanted to get that out there.  Greg Hughes, social security number.  I, you know something?  With a fair tax structure, it's an honor to be able to support this grand country of ours. 
[01:18:00]  But it has gotten to the point where we are now paying for mistakes that the government makes, for misappropriations, for just outright crime that's going on.  Anthony's going to end up with a Jim Cramer-style med money show, except it's only going to have one episode.  And they're going to be like, yeah, that's all I got. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, that's it.  Anthony with a shotgun and a bunch of political figures like Buss around.  He's just going to take pop shots at the worst tax offenders.  This to me is, oh, I had a point about taxes and I just, my brain just stopped working.  Well, let's introduce Mike Birbiglia.  Mike, he was piping in and doing a very good job right there.  What's up, Mike?  Not much, man.  I was just listening to you guys in the other room trash Rich Jenny and I was thinking about how...  We like Trash Rich Jenny.  We weren't really. 
[01:19:00]  You weren't?  No, he's a good guy.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  He's a good nice guy.  I was just like, well, the last time I was on, he trashed Rich Jenny.  I swear we don't talk about Richard Jenny that much.  It just seems when you're going to be on the show, his name comes up.  I don't know why.  It's just sad to me that he throws in the towel and he's probably going out thinking,  you know what?  You're not going to have Rich Jenny to beat on anymore.  You're not going to wait until I kill myself and then it's going to be all right. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, no.  And then he's listening on satellite or whatever, wherever he is.  He's just getting a faint transmission of the show.  And he's like, oh.  They're still doing it.  They're still doing it.  He killed himself in heaven, cut his own wings off.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Hey, we're obsessed with our Citadel stock.  This guy has a great idea for us, Ant.  Chris in Red Bank, New Jersey.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, Anthony.  If you think taxes are bad now, wait till Democrats get in. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, believe me.  I know.  One suggestion is that you could look at using those stocks as a charitable contribution to  some foundation and then writing off that charity.  You probably want to talk to a tax accountant, but it's an idea.  Oh, let's talk to somebody about that.  Wow.  I like that idea.  How about we stop forgiving foreign debt?  How about that?  How about we stop foreclosing on people's homes and stop forgiving foreign debt?  It's just, we want something.  Another country doesn't want to do it.  We forgive their debt.  Okay.  If you give a $10 billion debt or $20 billion debt, it makes you want to throw up. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Gold and guns.  Buy both.  Yeah.  In quantity.  What about the iPhones?  And granola bars.  Yeah, you need that.  And granola bars.  That's the 3G you're talking.  Granola, gold, and guns.  That's 3G technology we need.  It's change you can believe in.  Right.  Exactly.  All right.  Before we depress the hell out of everyone, we'll move on for now. 
[01:21:00]  We love talking about the tax thing.  It's ridiculous.  Sherry Shepard from The View.  Sherry Shepard.  I see her a lot.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we've said hi a few times.  Really?  Like, hey, what's up?  She's like, all right.  You're talking Jimmy?  You live in the same place as her?  Yeah.  Close.  What are some of the things she has said on The View?  She thinks the earth is flat.  Yeah.  She also thinks that the earth is only what? 
[01:21:30]  She's one of those that's only a couple thousand years old.  She's a fundamentalist.  Fundamentalist.  10,000 years?  Isn't that how old?  What was the big one where she was?  It was something about dinosaurs and Jesus walked the earth at the same time.  Of course they did.  Yeah.  And the dinosaur said, why, when I was in the tar pit, did I just see one set of my big  dinosaur footprints?  Why did you abandon me, Jesus?  And Jesus said, because you're too heavy, you big stupid dinosaur.  Yeah, exactly.  And of course, Pete, rain.  You got fat ankles. 
[01:22:00]  And eventually, we're going to need gas.  Yes.  So, you tried holding your hand, but your arms are so libel.  I didn't come in your image.  Yeah.  Because you bit me.  Remember, dummy?  You're eating leaves.  I left you.  I was trying to be holy, but we don't speak the same language.  I'm like, oh yeah, they're still apes.  I'll come back.  I'll come back later when they're cooked.  Jesus.  Well, listen to what she's up to now.  This is a good one, man.  All righty.  Sherry Shepard opens up about her sad history. 
[01:22:30]  Shocking revelations from The View co-host.  She's enjoying The View now, but not too long ago, life was pretty rough for Sherry Shepard.  I was in a very physically abusive relationship.  I was sleeping with a lot of guys and had more abortions than I would like to count.  Sherry Shepard tells Precious Times Magazine her life changed when she converted from being  a Jehovah's Witness to Christianity.  Sherry says in the 1990s, her family life was a mess.  Quote, my mother was dying from diabetic complications. 
[01:23:00]  My sister was heavy into drugs, and we would have to go and get her from crack houses.  Sherry says God made a difference in her life.  God, that's terrific.  These days, Sherry says she's proud to be a role model for women.  I love this chick.  Is she a role model?  Really?  No, she's not.  She said the world is flat.  She didn't know the world was round.  She's always on her back.  That's all she knows.  This chick rules.  She bangs, she gets rid of them, and she can pay a punch. 
[01:23:30]  More abortions than she can count.  Wow.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  What a wild, wild woman.  Well, we can play the old clip.  This is great.  Yeah, let's play that first.  I gotta hear it.  This is a little montage of Sherry Shepard.  Dumb things.  Keep in mind that probably when he was around, there was no Jesus Christ stuff going on. 
[01:24:00]  No, no, they still had Christians back then.  No, they still had Christians back then.  I don't want to be sick there.  I believe they had their gods.  They had Christians, and they had Christians, and they had...  I'm doing the outshot thing now.  And the Greeks, they had Christians, and they threw them to the lions.  I think this might predate that.  I think this might predate that.  They don't think anything predated Christians.  No, no, no.  That's all the right.  The Greeks came first.  Then the Romans, then the Christians.  Jesus came first before them, so I... 
[01:24:30]  No, okay, all right, all right.  That's the dumbest conversation.  Yeah, I don't want to turn this to a reason.  It doesn't matter anyway.  They didn't believe in Jesus.  They believed in polytheism, many gods.  Oh, my God.  She is a dummy.  She's as dumb as they come.  She's Voss if he was a black woman.  A dummy.  I was thinking the same thing.  That's Voss's credits.  A bunch of abortions.  And by those, you mean career missteps.  That's like a history discussion with only an understanding of People magazine. 
[01:25:00]  They really are.  She is a...  Joy Behar, I actually love her.  Oh, yeah, she's all right, man.  She's great on the show.  Yeah.  That show is...  She's very informed, Joy.  And she's not self-righteous.  Yeah, yeah.  She's not a baby.  Yeah.  She's great.  She can handle herself in a discussion.  This one, though, she...  Sherry Shepard is a dope.  No, no, no.  There wasn't anything before Jesus.  Really? 
[01:25:30]  Really?  Then what sin did he come to forgive, stupid?  The world was in trouble.  Why did he show up in the beginning?  Things are great.  Here I am.  Who are you and why do we need you?  I'm here to die for your sins.  No one's done anything wrong yet, JC.  God almighty, is she an idiot.  Sodom and Gomorrah, all those things that were happening, the big flood.  All the fun.  Yeah.  God, what a goose.  It's adorable, though.  Here's another one from Sherry Shepard.  Is the world flat?  Is the world flat?  Yes. 
[01:26:00]  I don't know.  What do you think?  I never thought about it, Whoopi.  Is the world flat?  I never thought about it.  You never thought about whether the world was right?  But I'll tell you what I've thought about.  How I'm going to feed my child.  Oh, shut.  My family, the world, is the world flat, has never entered into, that has not been an important thing.  What about the dead ones?  If my son, Jeffrey, asked me, is the world flat, I guess I will go and...  You know, didn't Columbus already work this question out?  I mean, why are we going to ask?  What did she say?  Didn't Columbus already work this question out? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I like the fact she's like, I've got to feed my family.  It's like, they're mutually exclusive.  You can only think of one.  Do you think the world is round?  My baby's hungry.  I can't...  Yeah.  Mommy, I'm hungry.  Oh, boy.  I guess I'm not going to be able to find out that whole world thing.  It's always when people have big drinking problems and serious life issues that they turn to God and then they become the president.  And I always respect people who don't turn to God in those situations.  I've had hard... 
[01:27:00]  I mean, I know you've had issues.  You didn't go to evolution doesn't exist theories.  No.  He just went to a girl with a deep voice.  Hi, Daddy.  I'll take all your problems away.  We're kind of evolution from half to female.  Bye, I'm Cro-Magnon, Daddy.  Yeah, I don't get it.  Why, when you hit the skids, as they say, you have to then sacrifice any common sense when it comes to science.  No logic whatsoever, yeah.  And logic and reason and adapt this whole or adopt this whole thinking that, you know, religion, that's great. 
[01:27:30]  If that gets you out of whatever crap you got yourself into in life, that's fine.  But why should you then sacrifice the ability to know if the world is flat or round?  That is a common thing that has been known for centuries by the smallest, dumbest, little, retarded child. 
[01:28:00]  But why would she answer that in that way, you think?  Does she have an agenda?  Because she's stupid.  She's stupid.  Just because she's stupid.  She's stupid.  She honestly didn't know if the world was flat or round.  She just doesn't know.  She's trying to be different, too, and trying to say...  Because she's seen globes.  Because she's just trying to say, like, hey, who knows what...  You know, like the people that are just trying to be interesting.  Is that just a round, flat map, though, to make it easy and spin pretty?  What about the globe?  Or have you ever seen one of those globe-type maps that are like a globe that's been flattened out? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, you try to be different.  You get a tattoo or something.  You don't act stupid and say the world's flat.  But I could understand when Columbus was living, but now we got pictures from space and space shuttles.  And where's the rest of the flatness going?  And the movie Contact.  You dummy.  Yeah, I mean, every...  The movie Contact.  That was a good movie, wasn't it?  Yeah, I love that movie.  Yeah, I like that one.  It was pretty cool.  Astronomer Carl Sagan with billions and billions and billions and billions. 
[01:29:00]  Dead.  Very badly raped.  You see?  We got someone actually sticking up for the Jesus thing.  Oh!  Here we go.  I love these.  Tim in Pennsylvania.  Jesus fan number one.  Hello.  You're on the air.  Hi, Tim.  Let's respect Tim's ideology.  Hi, guys.  Listen, I'm a born-again Christian, and I just want to clarify, Christians believe in the Trinity.  And the Trinity states that the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit are co-equals. 
[01:29:30]  Therefore, Jesus is God.  Therefore, Jesus existed before he was born of Mary.  Okay.  You got it?  Yeah, that makes sense.  You got it?  As long as she's not talking about, like, okay, Christ showed up, like, when Christ showed up.  You're talking about it in the sense of the Trinity.  That makes sense.  Sir, I don't want to criticize.  I don't think she's saying it in that way.  Maybe not.  I really don't.  And I don't want to criticize Jesus.  I've always thought that Jesus is a good role model, but he's kind of like the popular guy in high school,  where everyone says they're his friend, but he wouldn't name you as one of his best friends. 
[01:30:00]  Like, if you asked him who his best friends were, he'd be like, Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Matt Damon.  And he'd be like, what about Mike Perbiglia?  He'd be like, I feel like I'd recognize his face if I saw him, but the name doesn't ring a bell.  And he wouldn't say Martin Luther King, that womanizer.  No, sir.  That's such an odd thing.  So he's saying, like, in a spiritual sense, that Jesus was there the whole time, even before being—  That the Holy Spirit was always there, I suppose. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  The Holy Ghost.  But that's not what she's getting at.  No, no, no.  She's just stupid.  Right.  It's pretty much—  All right.  I think, though, looking at the Trinity, I think Trinity and Neo made a great pair, and it made three pretty good movies.  I thought not so good.  Trinity was good in that.  I believe in Tank.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The big black guy?  Is that Tank?  Oh, yeah.  Tank ruled. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  I also like the guy that was in that.  Yeah, but, you know, we have to look to the Oracle to find out if Neo is, in fact, the one.  And until I find that out, I think that guy from Pennsylvania doesn't really know about Trinity.  You're talking about different things.  He's talking about real God, and you're talking about a movie.  Literal Jim, everyone.  Literal Jim has made an appearance to destroy the bit.  No, I love Literal Jim.  Literal Jim's a bit, right? 
[01:31:30]  Literal Jim is a big foot in the middle of fun.  Steps on everything.  You say too much that you love Literal Jim.  That means you hate Literal Jim.  I cannot stand Literal Jim.  You hate LJ.  LJ sucks.  It's a little unfair, because Literal Jim is selectively literal.  Yeah.  Yes.  He just comes in whenever he chooses.  And just takes it literally.  Yeah.  And then you're stuck with no defense, and you've just got to go, okay.  Good point, Jim.  Good point, Literal Jim.  LJ steps in whenever he wants. 
[01:32:00]  I guess you don't like comedy.  Sounds good.  Literal Jim just likes it accurate.  Likes to get the facts out there.  That's the one.  All right, we're going to break.  Facts are fun.  We're going to break so we can catch up here.  We've got Robert Kelly.  RobertKellyLive.com.  Also, your CD's doing well on iTunes, right?  Yeah, iTunes.  You get it on iTunes.  Just a tip.  Yeah.  With the DVD.  Yep, DVD.  Very nice.  That's a smart place to put it, man.  iTunes, it's like no one goes to buy CDs anymore.  Nope.  iTunes is the monster of comedy CDs.  Also, Mike Birbigli in studio. 
[01:32:30]  He's playing the comedy show August 2nd.  We're very excited to have Mike on the show this year.  It's going to be completely devastating for me.  You'll be great, dude.  Why?  A lot of guys are more scared than they should be.  People know you from the show.  You've been on.  I wonder why.  I understand why.  Believe me.  I know the fans can be kind of crazy, but in Jersey, they're great.  Yeah.  I have snipers this year.  Jersey's always been good.  Snipers in the catwalk this year, by the way.  Yep.  First sign of anybody that wants to jump in and heckle. 
[01:33:00]  Red mist is what you'll see where their head used to be.  Nice.  Love the sniper red mist.  What's the sound?  Is it going to make?  It just makes that, yeah.  You hear like a...  That sound.  And then...  Red mist.  God, I love that.  I got to say, Mike Birbiglia performed at Central Park recently, and amazing.  Amazing show.  Amazing.  Those guys were loving you in Central Park, and it's going to be the same thing in Jersey 
[01:33:30]  at the PNC Art Center.  The gunshot would make more noise than the heckle, and plus it's illegal to shoot people.  The show would get shut down.  LJ.  Literal Jim.  LJ, everyone.  Literal Jim, just take me out of the mix.  Yeah.  I've never met Literal Jim, but I like him.  Do you love Literal Jim?  I like his faces.  Isn't he an ass?  He's so serious.  It's radio, but he puts on such a serious face.  He won't look at you in the eyes when he's telling you.  No.  He's just like, no, this is how it is.  Yeah.  I like humor as much as the next guy.  I had a... 
[01:34:00]  Are you trying to go to break?  Literal Jim's a douche.  Yeah, Literal Jim likes to have a laugh as much as the next guy.  He's a regular guy.  He likes having some fun.  That's what he does.  What do you find funny, Literal Jim?  I don't know, but I know that when we talk to people, we don't say their name like that.  Literal Jim, that's a setup.  Literal Jim doesn't have much.  Literal Jim finds a lot of things funny.  I like good situation comedies.  Television.  Literal Jim doesn't improv either. 
[01:34:30]  Yes, you do brilliantly.  Literal Jim is just good at poking his head in the room, wrecking everybody else's fun and backing out.  When the spotlight's on Literal Jim, he becomes Jim Norton.  Holds like a house of cards.  I want to thank Mike Verviglia for pointing out my nightmare, by the way.  Thank you.  I have the worst thing I have to do every morning, and that's like stop these mother effers.  Yeah.  Let's go to break.  It's tough.  All right, let's go to break.  We'll be good boys. 
[01:35:00]  It's Jimmy.  I tried.  I shut up for a minute.  But I want to thank Mike Verviglia, because he looked at me like, you have to go to break?  Yeah, we had to go to break 10, 12 minutes ago.  Opie, are you going to keep talking?  And I'm the one that has to stress every morning, because these guys don't see a clock.  One of my names is called Coss Kill.  I see a clock.  Coss Kill.  Opie's just talking.  I see a clock.  I want to tell you a story about a heckler who's threatening to kill me in Atlantic City, because  it made me think of it.  That's a hell of a tease.  Also, we got Richard Huff.  We're going to give him an exclusive from the Daily News today. 
[01:35:30]  We got Will Farrell and John C. Reilly calling the show to say hi.  They want me to do a movie with them.  I'm not doing it.  I looked at you seriously for a second.  Really?  Yeah, because that would be up for discussion.  Yeah, maybe.  More with Mike Verviglia and Robert Kelly.  They could take me to Rickshaw.  I'm just going to go to break here.  This is not good.  Not good for anyone.  And texters, get ready.  A little secret message.  Texters, get ready.  Hey, this is Nick DiPaolo.  Come see me July 26th. 
[01:36:00]  The Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York.  For ticket information, go to nickdipp.com or www.baystreet.org.  Owner of the Lonely Hearts  Owner of the Lonely Hearts  Owner of the Broken Hearts  Another busy show.  We got Robert Kelly in studio from robertkellylive.com.  Just a tip on iTunes. 
[01:36:30]  Yes.  We got Mike Verviglia.  Mike, are you promoting anything today?  You can also, I got like four things on iTunes as well.  So you can make a trip there and get some Robert Kelly stuff and my stuff too.  Yeah, his stuff is up there.  Do you get addicted to, do you ever just check where you are on the top?  All the time.  I know where you are and I am.  Do you get bummed out when you get up into the 90s?  Oh yeah, that doesn't happen, but I would.  I totally would.  Imagine.  You get up into the 90s.  It's happened.  I've watched you. 
[01:37:00]  I keep an eye on people I know.  I Google myself quite a bit though.  That's an embarrassing trend in my life.  Uh, because, uh, do you Google yourself, Jim?  Never.  Really?  No.  Everyone Googles themselves.  Yeah.  No, of course I do.  And then I even check under, I do, I Google myself a coach.  But there's another Jim Norton.  He's an actor and he won a Tony recently.  He's an older man.  Oh, is he?  A seat carer or something like that.  Yeah.  He won a Tony, an older gentleman.  There's another Robert Kelly too. 
[01:37:30]  He's a, he's a, there's a poet.  He's a comic.  He's a sculptor.  Oh.  And then, and then we, we know the R&B star who I get emails for from Africa all the time.  Really?  Supporting my cause.  I got a, uh, John Opie out there who's some kind of saxophonist I think.  I got a Ben Opie who I think is a, uh, terrific soccer player.  And then, uh, I got a Google alert yesterday.  Somebody named Gregory Opie was caught in a hotel room with booze and teenage girls.  All right, Greg Opie.  If you want to find that story, it's a great one. 
[01:38:00]  So Mike Birbigli and Robert Kelly are in studio because they're playing the, uh, the virus show this year.  That's right.  At the PNC Bank Arts Center, August 2nd.  Tickets still available.  Very excited that we have Mike on the, on the tour this year.  Or not the tour.  We're doing one show.  And of course, excited that, uh, Robert Kelly's coming back for a third time.  It's going to be great.  I like how the music changes like that.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  I hope it just kicked, kicked a hole in something.  Hey, we got an exclusive for Richard Huff from, uh, the New York Daily News. 
[01:38:30]  Richard.  Good morning.  Hi, Richard.  You got pen in hand?  We got a biggie for you.  I'm watching.  I'm watching, guys.  Yeah, but you got to give us credit for pointing this out, okay?  That's all we ask.  We help each other out, right, Richard?  There's a scandal.  There's a scandal.  I sort of want to keep, uh, Anthony out of this for the most part.  But the listeners have noticed, uh, and we certainly have noticed,  that the lovely Jill Nicolini, the traffic vixen from Channel 11 here in New York City,  she came to work today with a very, very nice outfit. 
[01:39:00]  Very appropriate summer wear.  Sure.  Um, of course, uh, Jill looks, uh, Jill looks great.  And, uh, nice little top.  Mm-hmm.  I don't, and, and, uh, she was wearing that.  Hold on.  I don't hear typing.  Richard.  Ha, ha, ha.  Are you wasting our time?  This is a, this is a big one.  Richard.  I want to hear some typing.  Big is the operative word there, isn't it?  Or I want to hear, like, uh, like, like, you know, writing. 
[01:39:30]  Richard is friends with Jill, too, so he knows, you know, the deal.  Well, I don't think Jill's going to be able to talk about this.  No.  Because something is going on at Channel 11.  Let me, all right, listen.  So, so every morning we watch Jill do the traffic.  And they were blaming it on me for the longest time.  And we don't watch the traffic as much these days,  because Anthony's now dating Jill Nicolini.  Yeah, that's an odd situation.  So when Anthony turns to watch the traffic,  we all used to watch the traffic together,  but now we all make believe we're busy doing something else.  So, but Anthony did comment. 
[01:40:00]  I could say this much.  Anthony comments said, oh, boy,  she's going to get in trouble for wearing that today.  I'm like, what?  Why?  It looks like the perfect outfit for Jill Nicolini.  She's, she's young, and she's got a nice body,  and, and, and she's, she's not necessarily flaunting it.  She's celebrating her sexuality.  It just looks good.  Looks good.  Thank you.  Can you write celebrating her sexuality?  I kind of like that one.  Jesus.  Kind of speculating.  But Anthony was doing some foreshadowing,  and I'm like, come on, that's crazy. 
[01:40:30]  We've seen her wear sexy outfits on TV before.  Yeah.  And then we're doing our radio show,  and we got her on one of the flat screens in the studio.  Next thing you know,  we see that she's covered up with this awkward blazer,  because that's, I guess,  all they have around Channel 11 this morning,  with the shoulder pads.  It's like something Ted Knight would have worn  on the Mary Tyler Moore show.  Right.  They made her cover up, Richard.  Yeah, I see that.  I see that.  What is wrong with Channel 11?  You know, it's an odd situation,  and we're launching an investigation this morning,  but it's a show that sort of flaunts that sizzle, 
[01:41:00]  not just with her, but with everybody else.  And to cover it up is kind of interesting.  You know, we find it a very fun show to watch.  Absolutely.  We have it on every morning during show prep,  because it is fun.  And the guys, you know,  they don't take themselves so seriously,  the guys and the girls and everything.  They get the point across with the news,  but it's done very loose and very casually  and very real as far as the people go. 
[01:41:30]  So then, you know, Jill's just being herself,  wearing her own wardrobe.  You know, it's the stuff she brings from home.  And then there she is in the next shot  wearing a blazer buttoned up to, you know, her neck.  Yeah, with shoulder pads.  It's like, at the very least,  they couldn't figure out something else for her to wear.  So I'd love to get to the bottom  of why this is happening.  Yep.  Who's responsible.  And, you know, what the reasoning is. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, no, as I said, you know,  it's, I mean, when you look at some of the other women  on that show and the...  Why would you?  Of course.  Yeah, all right.  Good, good.  But I can't look at yours now,  because that's awkward.  Well, it's not...  You know something?  Obviously, a beautiful girl is going to be looked at,  so it's not an issue.  Just TiVo it like I do.  Exactly.  And you go haul and scrap one out.  Jimmy!  It's the graphics.  You're there for the graphics.  And Richard writes about TV all the time. 
[01:42:30]  Sexuality, sex, it sells, right, Richard?  Oh, absolutely.  And as I said, you know,  this show aims for a younger audience.  They clearly, when you look at some of the stuff  Emily Francis wears or some of the other folks,  you know, they're selling the sizzle.  So it's interesting to see why,  to find out why this one was covered up.  I've got to say this very carefully,  because Anthony's now dating Jill,  and no disrespect whatsoever, and you know that,  but when Jill's out  and they've got the flat-chested one doing traffic,  I don't want to watch traffic. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  And I'm talking, you know, for the guys out there,  we don't care about the traffic.  We're looking at a beautiful girl doing the traffic,  because no one has TVs in their car,  so who cares?  You know, when we go out,  and people come up as a fan,  see, here's the traffic now,  I'm going to see her blazer.  When she's out, people say,  oh my God, the only reason I watch is to watch you.  Oh my God, I only watch for you. 
[01:43:30]  Oh my God.  So I went, see, look,  they put her in a blazer.  She looks very professional, though.  She does look very professional.  She is.  And you're dating that girl?  She can wear a gunny sack, believe me,  and look great.  Don't sound so surprised,  you son of a bitch.  It's just the first I've heard of it.  I'm happy.  I love how everybody goes.  Oh my God, that those two are dating?  Yeah, yeah.  Every morning.  He doesn't hear it anymore,  but it's eye contact in this.  Is this real?  It's not real.  Go on. 
[01:44:00]  We've heard that reaction probably a hundred times.  I think you're the hundredth one.  Yeah.  We know Anthony's holding on for dear life at this point.  We're not stupid.  I've never gotten...  It is like a monk episode  where you have something hidden in your wall  that she's trying to get at you.  Yeah.  You wear a costume or something?  People are saying...  I'm like for Big Leo.  Oh, wow.  Anthony's Mike?  People are saying that you might be behind this.  What?  You're telling her to cover up.  Why?  I never...  You better make it perfectly clear 
[01:44:30]  you have nothing to do with this, my friend.  Let me throw another tidbit into here  that'll dispel that one, my friend.  All right.  I have personally gone shopping with Jill  and bought her some of the more revealing outfits  that she owns.  Thank you.  I mean...  Thank you very much.  I just...  Let's throw another wrench in this.  All right.  There hasn't been a lot about the relationship  in the last couple weeks, media-wise. 
[01:45:00]  Could this be a publicity stunt?  Ah.  You know, like those candy ads  where you make an ad  and nobody will absolutely run  and then you say,  hey, look, scandal.  Nobody will run the ad?  Yeah.  Did you put her up to this?  Ah.  Why would I do that?  Say yes.  Like when Nick Cannon  married Mariah Carey?  That kind of thing?  You admitted you bought her  some of the sexier tuxedos  that she wears.  We got the before and after pictures of Jill  from this morning. 
[01:45:30]  We're going to put those up on onaradio.com.  Maybe next time you go shopping  you can update your clothing.  Look, I'm at work with a bunch of goons.  You look like an English teacher.  Look, you're wearing a t-shirt  with cash written on the front.  By the way, Bob,  how would you know  what an English teacher looks like?  That's true.  That's true.  That's true.  I should have said art teacher  or special needs teacher.  Oh, wow.  You really brought that down.  I have a nice...  No kidding.  A little shirt here. 
[01:46:00]  You know.  I just think you should dress...  You're dating her.  I dress very nicely  when we go out.  You should dress a little bit.  She knows I dress nice  when we go out.  Get a shirt with some stones in it,  some rhinestones and some skulls.  I wear like Joseph Abud shirts.  I wear Armani suits.  I wear nice things, my friend.  You all woo.  Go woo-woo.  What do you have to roll  when you're wearing it, actually?  Fine.  What's wrong with an eyes-on shirt 
[01:46:30]  with a t-shirt under it?  And it's just hanging out here  doing a show  with a bunch of goons.  We do morning radio.  We're not trying to impress each other.  Exactly.  Apparently, nobody bit on the  Anthony looks like crap thing.  All right.  We'll move on.  Bobby's doing Rich Voss-style crowd work.  Wait, Bobby.  We're all scared to say it,  so that's why.  We're taking this angle instead.  You guys are all scared,  so you throw me under the bus.  Yes, exactly.  When he snaps,  I'm the one who shoots.  You know how many guns he has?  When he takes his boot gun out.  Guns in gold.  He actually dresses like that 
[01:47:00]  so he doesn't have knives.  We shouldn't have turned on you, Bob.  You were slamming Anthony.  We all rushed it.  Oh, he's doing the best he can.  God love him.  Exactly.  Thanks.  All right, Richard.  What are the odds that you write about this,  it makes the paper tomorrow,  and we are mentioned prominently  for giving you this exclusive?  Hey, I watch TV, guys.  Yeah, he's conscious.  Can't you throw us a bone?  I might have to mention this.  Throw us a bone that we were obsessed with it  on our fine radio show.  Well, a lot of, put it this way, 
[01:47:30]  a lot of our listeners have noticed.  Yes.  And since I think we have given CW11 news in the morning,  a lot of viewers through our listeners,  I think it has an impact.  There you go.  Good point.  Yes, good point.  See, good point.  No, no, I give credit on that.  I'll add this too, Mr. Huff.  I truly believe that the lovely Jill Nicolini,  who's dating Anthony Cumia,  should be the entertainment reporter at this point.  There you go. 
[01:48:00]  There's something for your article.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  She does a much better job than this Emily Francis.  Oh, boy.  It's not even a knock on Emily Francis.  She's fine.  But I think Jill's personality is so big.  It's way better.  She's just perfect.  That's just like her,  I think her role should be that.  But Emily Francis could do something,  but it's just,  I think Jill's personality works.  Yeah, she could get coffee for the Yankers.  Is anyone suspicious, incidentally,  of maybe that's why Jill is dating Ant,  to get you to talk about her on the show?  You know.  There we go.  There we go.  I've heard that one before. 
[01:48:30]  Hey, Ant,  you're going to mention me on the radio tomorrow?  I'd love to be in the meeting with her boss.  This is what I want you to do.  Sit down.  It's top secret.  Oh, Mike Verbigler did not go down that road.  Awkward.  All Anthony does is bring down Jill Stuck.  Hey.  She loves Anthony.  Hey.  I'm not knocking you.  It's exposure.  Yes.  I disagree with that, Anthony.  My producers like it when you talk about me on the radio. 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  I know.  First of all,  who am I dating, Stuck or Patty?  Oh, my God.  It's wonderful.  You know, the beauty of this,  no, Jill couldn't be using him.  The fact that you're garbage  is testament to the fact that she really loves you.  Yes.  Thank you, Jim,  for that backhanded insult.  No, no, no.  I mean, you're brilliant,  but you bring nothing.  Yes.  She, on the other hand,  it's true.  You're brilliant,  but you bring nothing. 
[01:49:30]  She is a 10 dating an average Joe.  An average guy  with a hell of a sense of enumerate personality.  But he's cranky when he's sick.  Yeah.  I was very cranky when I was sick.  Yes, I was.  He's driving a gas guzzler.  He likes Nazi stuff.  Big for the era.  I'm a fan of the era.  Big, fat, meaty hands.  I'm not saying I like what Hitler did.  I'm just saying they were snappy dressers.  Absolutely.  I like their gear and their memorabilia.  You just play Michael Richards' audio  as you're driving down a lot of space. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Set to an Enya record.  Let's get Richard Huff off the phone.  Richard.  All right, Richard.  Don't disappoint us.  Hey, can I ask Richard a question?  And make our names in bold face, too, all right?  Let me ask Richard something.  We would appreciate that.  Yes, sir.  You watch it.  Have you seen that?  Anthony was talking about the Generation X.  Have you seen that yet?  Generation Kill.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Generation Kill.  Generation Kill.  Yeah, I have.  I've seen almost all of it.  What do you think of it?  I like it. 
[01:50:30]  I like it.  I thought it started a little slow,  like most HBO shows do.  Yeah, well, I felt the first episode,  you know, you were sitting there  waiting for the clink of somebody's helmet  to blow up.  Some action.  Yeah, I know.  But I'm kind of glad they did that  because it would have made it seem like,  all right, it's going to be this big war action thing.  It was kind of good to kind of build up  their characters a little bit.  Absolutely.  A lot of tension built up,  that sort of stuff.  Some really great dialogue going on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, between these guys,  you know, the guy who's doing the driving 
[01:51:00]  and driving you crazy with his commentary  the whole time is kind of fun.  And it's a really interesting piece.  It's well worth watching.  And I think it's such a great contrast  from old war shows  to see something like this  and really get an appreciation  for how I believe this is pretty accurate.  You know, you've got a bunch of young guys  in there just BSing with each other  in a bad situation.  And I really think that's how they would  and do act in that situation.  And who are you dating on Generation Kill? 
[01:51:30]  Actually, the guy that had his ass branded  in Oz by Schillinger.  Beecher.  Hey, Richard.  What else are you watching these days?  Did you want to go with another question?  No, no.  I had a question about an HBO thing  because...  Lucky Louie, it's off the air.  No, we're getting to see...  Oh, sorry, Jim.  That did hurt a little.  It did, but it was true.  You were stating the truth.  You were literal Anthony.  Literal Anthony hurts. 
[01:52:00]  So, hey, I'm a big fan of The Wire.  We all are.  Once again,  they are not nominated for an Emmy.  And I can't comprehend  how that show does not get nominated ever.  It's such a purposeful  and disgusting slight  by those sissies that make the decisions.  Why is this brilliant show  not being nominated?  Why was it never nominated?  Yeah, I think, you know,  we'll find out why Jill  had to cover up easier than that.  Yeah, I guess so.  You know, it is one of those  weird situations 
[01:52:30]  where you have a show  that's critically acclaimed.  Everybody who watches it loves it.  I just think maybe  the audience was too small  and maybe the subject too tough  for people to actually  spend time watching.  Who makes the Emmy decisions?  What fruits are voting on this?  What out-of-touch fruits  are voting for the same thing  every year?  The Wire was so good.  They shot outside the system too,  shooting in Baltimore.  Yep.  And plus, you know,  to have the characters,  I guess you said,  the subject matter  was very difficult.  But they are just 
[01:53:00]  disgusting,  out-of-touch sissies  to not have nominated this show  and the brilliant stuff  they did.  It's sickening.  Yeah, deep, well-written show.  It did get, I think,  a writing nomination.  Yeah, of course it did.  Reward the white people  involved with it.  But nobody else.  Don't give, you know,  a Bubz or Omar  or any of those guys.  Yeah, Martin Luther Norton.  But it's true!  What happened?  It's true.  Spike Lee has never been nominated  for Best Director.  Driving with him in traffic.  Because his directing stinks.  No, he doesn't.  No, he sucks.  Oh, he sucks.  Malcolm X was great, dude. 
[01:53:30]  Do the Right Thing was great.  No, I love him.  He's quirky.  Yeah, but he's still good.  No, he isn't.  I love him.  Moe Better Blues is a good film.  I never saw that one, actually.  It's good.  Hey, Richard,  one show we should be watching.  Oh, good point.  You know, I think  Swingtown on CBS  is kind of fun.  They just moved it  to Friday nights.  The show about swingers  in the 70s.  Once you get past the stuff,  it's interesting.  Certainly, I think  Hopkins,  the documentary series  on ABC, 
[01:54:00]  which I think  winds up in two weeks.  Thursday nights at 10.  Fabulous documentary  following doctors  down in  Johns Hopkins University.  I've seen a couple episodes  of a show coming on  in September  called True Blood  from Alan Ball,  the guy from  Six Feet Under,  HBO.  They've been promoting  it a little bit already.  Really good show.  What's that  Kristen Slater thing?  Oh, yeah.  That's for NBC.  I forget what  the title of that one is.  Go back to True Blood.  You were going to  say what that's about. 
[01:54:30]  I'm sorry.  It's about vampires  living basically  in the current time  and surviving  on synthetic blood.  Stars Anna Paquin.  I'm not a big vampire guy.  I'm not a vampire guy  at all.  I sat through two episodes.  It's really interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean,  she's grown up nice  and this interesting cast,  interesting concept.  It's from Alan Ball  who did Six Feet Under  and American Beauty  which was both  well-written shows.  What do you think  of Mad Men?  A lot of people  are trying to push  that show down my throat.  I just haven't  watched it yet  but I'm hearing 
[01:55:00]  really good things  that are trying  to push Mad Men  down your throat.  That would make  them happy, man.  You know,  it's one of those shows  that's well done.  People love it.  I haven't fallen  in love with it.  It's just,  I haven't been  interested in it  that much.  Yeah.  But, you know,  people around my office  here and viewers  write in about it  from time to time  that they just  fall in love with it  and absolutely dig it.  I mean,  Hinkley's reviewed it  in today's paper  and gave it four stars.  Right.  I just haven't fallen  under that spell  yet either. 
[01:55:30]  And I just finished up  the first season  of Californication.  Love it.  Yeah.  And we're having  David Duchovny on  I think tomorrow.  Yeah,  that's a really good show  and really funny  and really well-written  and pointed  pop culture references.  He's great in that show.  How can you tell  it's well-written?  I'm too busy looking  at all the hot girls  he gets for this show.  Wait,  yeah.  Okay,  wait,  wasn't one of them  in Lucky Louie?  Yes.  Pamela Adlon.  I'm happy to see  she's got a gig.  She's a great actor.  Jimmy,  she's great in this show.  Of course she is. 
[01:56:00]  She's really,  really good.  She's the agent's wife.  It's fun.  You know,  stuff happens like,  you know,  there was that whole  vomit scene last year  that came out of nowhere  and just totally  throws you off.  I mean,  there's stuff in that show  where you just go,  wow,  that's pretty amazing  in the way they did that.  Hey,  do you watch any of the,  HBO On Demand is great too.  They have,  there's a documentary  called Ganja Queen.  Do you see that?  I haven't seen it.  I know it's there.  It's about the girl  who's arrested in Indonesia.  They give you the death sentence  for drug importation in Indonesia. 
[01:56:30]  And she's arrested  for smuggling 10 pounds of pot  in a boogie board bag.  A surfboard bag.  Is that what they call it?  Yeah,  it's called a boogie board.  And she's nothing.  But that's what they call it.  That's the name.  All right,  little Jim.  No,  I'm just being,  go ahead.  Just go.  But anyway,  I ran out of steam on this one,  but I recommend Ganja Queen.  There you go.  There you go.  All right,  why don't we,  what about the untitled  Mike Birbiglia project?  Do you like that?  Sorry,  I like you to come a part of it.  Oh,  it didn't get picked up.  No, 
[01:57:00]  it didn't get picked up.  It was on CBS.  I don't know that first.  Well,  how many,  what'd you do?  Shoot a pilot?  We shot a pilot,  yeah.  Okay.  What was it about?  It's like Mike Birbiglia's life,  except it's a sitcom.  How are the other CBS shows?  Do you like any of the comedies they have?  No,  you know,  none of the,  there's nothing this year  on the broadcast network  that we've seen so far  that's really just popping out  and saying this is a,  you know,  a buzz breakout hit.  We haven't seen a lot of stuff yet 
[01:57:30]  on these shows,  but right now there's nothing that,  you know,  you just sit here and say,  I gotta see this when it comes on.  What do you think about the big,  the big,  the big standup comedy show  coming on HBO  with all these new young comics,  great host,  starts in September.  Wait,  you're on that,  right?  It's not about me,  dude,  who cares?  Down and Dirty with Jim Norton,  it's unimportant,  but I'm saying it's about the comics  that are on the show.  Of course.  I'm just,  I'm just a spoke in the wheel.  Who's on the show?  Anybody?  Artie Lang's in an episode.  Yeah,  Patrice.  Who hosts that thing? 
[01:58:00]  What's that?  Who hosts it?  Oh,  I do,  but it's not about me.  It's Down and Dirty with Jim Norton.  All right,  listen,  let's get Richard Huff out of here.  Thank you.  All right,  Richard.  You'll be writing about the Jill Nicolini thing.  I'm launching an investigation now.  They forced her to cover up with a blazer.  Anthony,  I'm just reading this feedback.  Don't,  don't,  don't kill the messenger.  Okay.  People are thinking that maybe she's covering up the first trimester.  Oh.  Absolute denial.  All right.  Absolute denial.  All right,  I want to make sure you get that out there. 
[01:58:30]  Yes,  there is no pregnancy.  So let's squash that rumor immediately.  Squash it.  All right.  Hey,  is Prison Break coming back on?  Yeah,  eventually.  Okay.  Yeah,  no,  it's coming back.  Excellent.  All right,  Richard Huff.  See you,  buddy.  Thank you so much.  Bye.  I have to just address Mac from Atlanta.  He goes,  Ant,  I don't even need to talk to him.  He goes,  how does Ant know Generation Kill is real or is,  you know,  realistic or so real?  I didn't say that.  I wasn't over there.  I don't know that.  I said,  I'm assuming by watching it and knowing young guys and what they have to go through over there, 
[01:59:00]  that that would be the type of conversations that would go on.  And that would be how they would treat each other and be in a group together, you know,  just kind of.  You actually said,  I would imagine.  I would imagine.  I said,  I would imagine.  Mac.  So don't try to put words in my mouth.  Mac.  Put something in my mouth.  Make it a big,  you know,  big,  a nice, 
[01:59:30]  big,  fat  commercial.  Spend an hour in this chair alone in this room and you'll feel sick.  Oh God.  Afraid.  Oh my goodness gracious.  Ashamed.  What the hell?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  This was a lot of fun today.  Opie and Anthony still going strong.  We got Robert Kelly in studio.  Mike Birbiglia.  Both these guys will be at the PNC Bank Art Center August 2nd for our big, 
[02:00:00]  huge comedy show.  During the show,  by the way,  we're going to be giving away a car.  Thanks to all American Ford,  all American Ford.net.  Yes.  A car.  Yes.  Details on on a radio.com.  An actual car.  Yes.  Do they get it there?  Yeah.  They can drive it home?  Yeah.  Drive through the lawn.  Whatever.  If it's yours,  do whatever you want with it.  Yeah.  Oh.  Donuts out in the parking lot?  Sure.  Why not?  Why not? 
[02:00:30]  Tear it up.  That'd be great.  You know what I would love?  One of our listeners wins.  Don't say it.  What?  What's up?  Yeah.  What do you got?  What do you got?  I was going to say,  what?  One of our listeners wins and they're wearing like an O&A shirt and everything like that  because they're a big fan and they drive off with it and it's not somebody that just,  you know, kind of, eh, just wants a car.  Somebody's chick who doesn't even like you guys.  And then a big boulder from the Taconic.  No, no, no.  What?  No, no, no.  You actually said something nice and showed that you actually care about the people that 
[02:01:00]  listen to you every morning.  I can't stand our listeners.  The Taconic.  It's a turkey and a deer at the same time.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And then it matches into a tree.  God damn wild kingdom.  Oh, yeah.  You're hoping for that boulder that's been there since the start of time.  Oh, just perch.  And decides at that moment it needs to fall.  Why?  That boulder that has seen dinosaurs walk the earth and is not budged picks the moment  a church bus drives by. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Whammo.  Kablooey.  And then we have to hear, it's God's way.  God's will.  They were on their way to a retreat.  Right.  Wow.  They're on their way to do nothing but good.  Someone must have had an impure thought on the bus.  Someone must have just looked at an ankle and been like, wow, would I like to smash.  They should, yeah, that new Mustang would be great if it was found somewhere like against  a cement divider with the steering wheel in his chest and a spilled bottle of old granddad 
[02:02:00]  all over.  No seatbelt, no nothing.  But the shape of the wreck is in a W.  Of course.  There's someone out there listening right now who had that exact thing happen who's  just crying.  Lost someone they cared about.  All the wow and ONA stickers all decked out on the thing.  But you can't see them just because the news footage is just a gassy flaming wreck with a  charred black thing on the ground with a white sheet over it. 
[02:02:30]  What the hell?  It was supposed to be a happy day.  They just came from a popular radio show's comedy event.  Wouldn't even mention our name.  No.  Oh, it would be something like they spent three hours laughing, but no one's laughing now.  Yeah.  But now only tears from the family of this poor 24-year-old fat live-in-the-basement loser  mother effer. 
[02:03:00]  Don't forget bald goatee.  This is what I was worried about with the virus show, because I was in Atlantic City a couple  months ago.  I did a show where I'm talking about politics.  It's not even that extreme.  I'm just talking roughly about the political landscape.  You're a socialist, right?  This guy goes, I found out later what he was saying.  He was like, we didn't die since 9-11.  You didn't die since 9-11. 
[02:03:30]  But I didn't hear him, the whole thing.  All I could hear him go was over and over go, die.  You die.  And I was just like, oh, I guess I'm going to get shot at the Trump casino or whatever  in Atlantic City.  And the headline, this is what I thought of it, is just going to be,  unknown comedian gets shot at casino for lukewarm political material.  They'd use Trump's name as a big one.  Yeah.  Comedian trumped by bullets. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  All right, listen, we did some primetime gossip earlier in the show.  In case you missed it, we're going to play that one.  But then we've got a brand new one for everybody, so stay there.  We're back with more primetime gossip.  Controversial news has been buzzing around the entertainment world.  Radio shock jock Anthony Cumia spent the first half of this week at home instead of going to work.  I was, like, frying in bed.  Yeah.  Just laying in a puddle of sweat. 
[02:04:30]  It was horrid.  And it wouldn't go away.  Apparently he was sick with a mystery disease.  Speculation has been running amok as to what his ailment is, but our sources were able to uncover all the juicy details.  Anthony has contracted the AIDS virus.  It's purely viral.  The doctor can't do crap about it.  His mood was made worse this week when he told his Anthelini soulmate, Jill Nicolini, who responded by saying that she didn't want to be around him when he was sick with the fatal disease. 
[02:05:00]  This made the AIDS-ridden DJ furious, who responded by trying to throw her out of his house.  I'm like, just don't F with me.  I don't want to be touched.  I don't want to be talked to.  I just want to lay here in my own goo.  Then she says I kicked her out of the house.  Will Anthelini survive this latest monkey wrench thrown into the mix?  Only time will tell.  Unfortunately, time is not something Anthony has a lot of.  Stay tuned as this shocking story continues.  You guys laugh. 
[02:05:30]  It's just as accurate as TMZ, The Insider.  I don't know where they get their facts from.  I don't know where they get their facts from.  I can officially say here I have not been diagnosed with any serious disease, especially one as serious as the AIDS virus.  I had what was pretty much a little flu bug for a few days.  Watch how Sam spins that. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, why?  He'll spin it.  Yeah, he will.  Bastard.  We got a brand new one from Primetime Sam Roberts.  Oh, okay.  He might be off the hook.  I'm not sure.  Hope so.  That's what I'm hearing.  We're back with another Primetime gossip update from Primetime Sam Roberts.  When we last left you, we talked about the plight of Anthelini's Anthony Cumia and his quote-unquote mystery illness.  I was like frying in bed.  Just laying in a puddle of sweat.  At one point, I thought I had accidentally wet the bed. 
[02:06:30]  Well, there may have been some funny business happening behind closed doors at the Opie and Anthony show because gay executive producer Steve C. started showing similar symptoms.  Steve C. texted me.  He, apparently, was in bad shape.  We all know how this disease has passed, don't we?  Steve also announced that he was getting a colonoscopy done.  Not because a doctor recommended it, but for fun.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, tell Steve to take two twinks and call us in the morning. 
[02:07:00]  No, I can't have any new twinks.  Why are we telling you?  I'm not allowed to twink.  I'm allergic to twinks.  It said it on the WebMD.  What will happen next?  Will Anthelini be able to patch things up?  Will Steve C. stop giving everyone around him the creeps?  Stay tuned as primetime gossip keeps you up to date.  That's pretty good there, Sam.  Primetime Sam making some bold accusations in that one.  Just some blanket bold accusations, not even alleging. 
[02:07:30]  You are stating this as fact.  What do you mean?  How did you address producer Steve?  Oh, I might have said gay executive.  Gay executive producer.  But he is happy, so, you know.  Oh, oh, okay.  Sam's protecting himself a little bit.  I didn't know you were going back into, like, 1930s.  Hey, it's me. You got the AIDS.  Sorry.  Mike.  I went into your girlfriend's voice again.  That was a different one, at least.  Hey, Bob! Hey, Bob! 
[02:08:00]  Hey, it's Bob.  Hello.  Hello.  Top of the morning to you, Bob.  Chop, chop.  Yo.  Doesn't he look English?  Yeah.  He's got, like, a pasty complexion.  He looks peaked.  He's a little peaked.  Talk about AIDS.  Let's talk about AIDS.  Yeah, it's a little, like, pasty.  You got, like, Prince William ears and a little bit of the English teeth. 
[02:08:30]  I call it a ruddy complexion.  Ruddy complexion.  And he's got the worst English accent ever.  He looks like the first ten chapters of David Copperfield.  We got to tear down the wall for Mike for a second, Mike Birbiglia.  We noticed that he looks English, so we insist that he just talks in an English accent, even  though he's from Jersey, and we do not want to even acknowledge that he's not English anymore.  I want to have to put an Amish hat on, stand by a screen door, and go, you're all gonna die anymore. 
[02:09:00]  God is in his holy temple.  Cool.  Listen to his English accent.  We refuse to acknowledge that he's not English.  Go ahead.  Hello, Mr. Birbiglia.  Terrible.  And if he stops, you know, speaking English, he's out.  Yeah.  He's out.  We don't want anything to do with him.  That lipless skeleton with a bird victim hairdo. 
[02:09:30]  A bird sheath.  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  He looks a little bit like Two-Face from Batman with the teeth, you know?  He's got the heavy teeth.  I don't know.  It could be a few things.  No, I'm saying it in a nice way, like he's got a nice smile.  He kind of has, his mouth kind of looks like when Willem Dafoe's saying he's got to take  three men to outflank the other guys in platoon.  They ripped us apart.  Wherever he goes, we just yell, hello, Bob. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, I am Bob.  So I think we should send you out on the street and do a little what's the haps, but make him  do it in an English accent.  Make believe you're a reporter from Britain or something.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's a huge...  Yeah, he really is.  Hey, can you shut your mouth?  You're able to...  Oh, yeah.  Does it take every muscle in your face just to keep that big mouth shut?  His ass cheeks actually lift up.  All right, Bob.  Wouldn't that be ironic if you got hit by one of those double-decker buses out in the city? 
[02:10:30]  It's true.  While holding some teeth.  Yes.  Crumpet.  Who would hold a crumpet in the street?  Pardon.  Thank you.  Let's say goodbye to Bob.  See you then.  All right.  Step in the morning, Bob.  Bob's your uncle.  Bye, Bob.  Hey, Puddle of AIDS, he writes from Jersey, CBS FM is playing Christmas music in July.  Holy moly.  Wait a minute.  Let me give him one. 
[02:11:00]  Because that's wacky.  They are kooky.  Please have E-Rock smash their records.  You want to do a little CBS abuse today?  Sure.  What do we want them to do?  Oh, no.  CBS is right outside our door.  Get the camera.  What record do they play, though?  We'll see Christmas in July, because, you know.  I don't get it.  Because it's crazy.  Because we're in the middle of summer.  See, they're crazy.  I don't get it.  It works for a good bar promotion on a Tuesday night, but, you know.  Literal gym, it's comedy. 
[02:11:30]  No, no.  This is Jim Norton.  I don't get it.  Wouldn't it be odd if you're outside and it's 90 degrees out?  You're in your T-shirt.  You're sweating, maybe.  The windows are rolled down.  You're looking at everybody else.  They're dressed all light clothed and everything.  And you're hearing jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock on your radio.  See, that's insanity.  Jimmy, nothing, no, smile, no.  It's called Christmas in July, Jimmy.  No, no.  I understand the title of it.  I just don't understand why anyone would listen to it. 
[02:12:00]  It's not ironic.  It's not funny.  It's not interesting.  It just stinks.  It makes you want Christmas.  Why celebrate Christmas only once a year when you could celebrate it twice a year?  Because Christ only had one birthday.  Yes.  So what do you want Iraq to do?  Die.  Well.  Iraq.  He just puts his arms up clean.  It's called Bud Dwyer.  Make a big speech.  Are they playing Christmas songs or just every once in a while?  I'm trying to find that out.  I think it's just a bit.  Iraq, could you go and just pop your head in with the microphone?  We need a mic.  Let's go. 
[02:12:30]  Did you guys ever hear Grandma Got Run Over by a Ranger?  That always makes me laugh.  Yeah.  It's a funny song.  We're running out of show, but could you open up the door, ask them, go, we hear you're  playing Christmas music.  Why?  They'll give you the answer, and then you just yell at them that it's stupid.  That is stupid.  And then slam the door.  That's funny.  This never goes well.  This is called getting everyone uncomfortable.  This, and then they put things on our pictures outside, on our big posters that are on the 
[02:13:00]  hallway walls.  Yeah.  They tape things over our pictures to get back at us.  What's up, P?  Stump Brain's in there.  Why is Stump Brain in there?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Why is he ruining this?  What is he doing?  Oh, Jesus.  Buckle in.  Buckle in.  Buckle in.  Let's see what he's doing first.  No, buckle in, because this is going to be a biggie.  What are you doing, Stump Brain?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm trying to find out what the heck they're doing, but it's a, they've got a computer  problem, and they're like playing one Christmas song an hour. 
[02:13:30]  They're not like playing Christmas.  Yeah, one an hour is stupid.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  So, your line before you slam the door is, that is stupid, and then slam the door.  Mike, just move over.  Yeah.  Give E-Rock your mic.  Let's get this done, because we're running out of show on this side.  Don't we have a cordless for him?  I don't know.  Not over here.  Why would we?  Yeah, why would we, uh...  All right.  All right, E-Rock, uh, just say, we're hearing...  You know what you're doing, right?  All right. 
[02:14:00]  All right, here's E-Rock, everyone.  He hates doing this.  It requires walking, that's why.  Right outside the studio.  He's opening the door.  The microphone doesn't go.  He's chickening out.  Yes, he.  Yeah, do it while they're on the air.  Oh, my God, you can't.  No, wait for commercial.  Why?  They'll fire us.  No, they won't.  Oh, they'll fire us. 
[02:14:30]  What?  Maura doesn't.  Yeah, Maura.  She doesn't care?  Maura's going to be mad.  She's mad if there's not enough beer in her fridge, in her office.  Don't call the GM a drunk.  That's what she gets mad about.  We're doing another show.  Well, we're doing another show, too.  You're playing music.  Yeah.  Brenda Lee, rock around the...  Brenda Lee, rock around the...  That is so stupid.  That didn't work, though.  Oh, my God.  Shut the door.  I heard it fine. 
[02:15:00]  Shut the door.  Lock it.  I don't want those CBS FM people coming in here.  The mic cord wasn't long enough.  What happened?  I heard it.  We could hear it in the background, but we wanted it on the air.  Jimmy was going...  No, they heard it on the air.  He goes, well, why don't you listen?  I said, we can't.  We're doing another show.  And he's like, well, we're doing a show.  I said, you're not doing a show.  You're playing music.  So what music are you playing?  He goes, all the great ones.  Brenda Lee, rock around the Christmas tree.  And as he's saying that, I said, that is so stupid.  And I slammed the door on him.  We got a good video of it, at least. 
[02:15:30]  All right, good.  All right, we'll throw that up on YouTube.  Here it comes.  Why couldn't we hear it on mic?  The cord wasn't long enough.  The cord wasn't long enough.  That happens.  Why would it be, right?  Right, guys?  This isn't like a radio show, is it?  No.  What, theirs?  No, this one with cords and technology and audio things.  We would do better with a Mr. Microphone and a radio.  I think in all fairness, the last time we made fun of them, the mic went right into their studio.  I have a feeling that people are working against us behind the scenes. 
[02:16:00]  And I think they made that cord short.  Just too short.  Yes.  Like what Foghorn Leghorn does to the dog.  This leash.  It just makes it just short enough.  Yes.  All right.  That'll make a better video.  But E-Rock, once again, did it.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  This show should be called That'll Make a Better Video.  Mike Birbiglio. 
[02:16:30]  Going to be at the comedy show we're doing at the PNC Bank Arts Center, August 2nd.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster.com.  And we're giving away a car.  Simple as that.  Go to onaradio.com for details on how you can win the car from allamericanford.net.  Mike, anything else you're promoting?  No, man.  Go get me and Rob Kelly's stuff on iTunes.  Let's make Dane Cook and Bo Burnham pissed off.  Make me and Mike number one and two.  I'm announcing.  This is the first time I found out today.  I'm doing Sleepwalk with me.  My one-man show off Broadway in October. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, congratulations.  When you were working that out at Caroline's.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Yeah, it's pretty exciting.  October 15th.  Congratulations on that.  That's good.  That's really good for you.  Thanks, man.  And, Robert, anything else?  RobertKelleyLive.com and the tour.  Yeah, the tour next week.  We're doing it and my CD on iTunes.  I keep saying tour because I'm used to going all over the country for the summer.  We're doing one.  We're doing one and done this year.  One city shebang.  One city shebang.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And your phone number, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  If you can call us, 917-267-2602, I think. 
[02:17:30]  You can call.  And I actually do leave messages.  And I call fans back sometimes.  I'll call back and leave.  Again, I don't listen to all of them.  I think it's a lot.  But it's really a cool interactive thing, man.  And the only charge you get is if your cell phone will come and charge you for a minute  that you use.  All right.  Very good.  I'm not making any money off of it.  Cool.  We're off to XM Satellite Radio.  Goodbye to Buffalo.  This might be it.  This might be it.  Goodbye to Buffalo.  See you guys tomorrow. 
[02:18:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Good evening.  I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.  I'm standing on the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.  It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985.  118 area.  And this is temporal experiment number one.  Coming this weekend to the Saturday Night Virus, directly following the Laszlo Show,  it's the secret show to the future.  We're going to watch Back to the Future in studio, live, on the air. 
[02:18:30]  You're going to do the same exact thing at your house, just like syncing up Pink Floyd's  The Wall with The Wizard of Oz.  And you don't have to worry about any kind of delay or not matching up with us because  we're going to tell you when to hit play.  So even though there's eight seconds delay, and even though it takes time for our voices  to go into XM, into the satellites, and then into space, and then back down into your  radios, it doesn't matter because I'm going to tell you we're going to go three,  two, one, and go.  So you're going to be synced up at your house because you're going to press play when we 
[02:19:00]  tell you, and you're going to actually be listening to things that we say.  Midnight, directly following the Laszlo Show on the Saturday Night Virus, it's the secret  show to the future.  My calculations are correct.  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious shit.  In the world of Radio Shot Shots, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options. 
[02:19:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:20:00]  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Oh, it's...  Uh, wardrobe?  Opie and Anthony.  Yes!  Opie and Anthony.  What are you doing in death?  I've been hanging a lot with JFK.  He's the life of the party, let me tell you.  Why would he be the life of the party?  At the party, he's the one that goes around with the Doritos. 
[02:20:30]  And he fills his head with salsa.  Oh, my God.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are, XM Satellite Radio.  Hi, you bastards.  Waiting for a merger to go through.  Rumor has it any moment.  Who knows?  Is it finally going to happen?  What the fuck, Bobby? 
[02:21:00]  I'm doing the big fucking star of the show.  And he's doing the big banana.  And I was just eating a banana.  And Bob just deep-throated a banana.  And you're deep-throated a banana.  And it gave me a tingle.  Oh, my God.  Are you crazy?  Because he has fucking juicy lips and good technique.  Oh, my God.  You would give great head.  I mean, he would.  He's doing...  What do you think he does with Dane in the private fucking jazz?  Time to pay your way, Bobby.  Hey, Bobby, can you do my banana next?  What do I have to do while I'm giving the Sufi? 
[02:21:30]  Every verse.  Yeah.  A Sufi is one ball tickle and one in the asshole.  We all know that.  Hey.  Everything Bobby does is a plug for his album, Just the Tip.  Yes.  Everything is a subtle plug.  A subtle plug.  Right.  He just ate the tip of the banana.  The tip?  And put the rest of it right down his throat.  I tickled the balls with the tip of my tongue.  He fucking bit the thing in half.  I think so.  Ow.  I was in Juvie Hall.  What are you going to do?  I was in Juvie.  You got to do what you got to do to survive, right, Bobby?  I told you that neighbor.  Promise me a steak in the closet. 
[02:22:00]  Well, I was going to say we were going to do merger stuff, but who the fuck knows?  We can do merger stuff after that hotness.  Merger.  Yeah, it was a merger.  Rumor has it's going through.  We'll have to wait and see.  We don't have the inside word anymore.  Now people think this is a best of from like months ago.  No kidding.  Yeah, it's going through right here.  It's from October of 2006.  Yeah.  No shit.  Best of boring.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  I pulled some show prep out of my pocket.  Oh.  We also have this Robert.  What?  Show prep.  You got a wrinkled piece of paper.  You guys used to do so much show prep and so much work.  Now it's like, yeah, I wrote this down.  Oh my God.  Now I got it.  We had no show prep.  We never had show prep.  Actually, we're over prepared now.  Yep.  That's the truth.  We've been this shitty since WNEW.  Right.  There were like major chunks of time at N.E.W.  We didn't know what the fuck we were going to do next. 
[02:23:00]  Yes.  1998 to 2002.  Yeah.  And it showed, by the way, a lot of times.  But people still think it's the best we ever did, which amazes me.  Oh.  Whatever.  That's their opinion.  Hey, Hall County Jury Awards Jilted Bride $150,000.  So wait.  Because the husband left after she sued her former fiancee calling off the wedding.  So the fiancee gets the cold feet and he says, fuck this. 
[02:23:30]  I don't want to go through with this.  And there's actually a jury out there that saw it her way and decided to give her $150,000  because the boyfriend said no.  Probably the wedding expenses or whatever.  Rosemary Schell said she left a high-paying job in Florida to be with her ex-fiancee, Wayne Gibbs.  And she said she has suffered emotionally since their breakup.  Oh.  Uh, this has been the most difficult thing I've ever had to do and I think justice has 
[02:24:00]  been served, said Schell.  Uh, Gibbs testified that he paid $30,000 of Schell's debt while they were engaged, then  canceled the wedding after finding out she had even more debt.  Oh, so he didn't want to take on her problems.  Fucking baggage.  You're being sued now for dumping bitches?  That's why we're bringing this up, Jimmy.  Now you can get sued for dumping bitches.  I think they asked him why he did that.  He goes, I like doing things like that.  He paid her a bundle along with the engagement ring that was really worth a lot of money. 
[02:24:30]  I didn't pay her.  It wasn't me.  It was them.  The warriors left her at the altar.  And then all the black guys rev because she fucked them.  That's why they left.  Rev!  Hey, um, did she get the ring back?  Uh, probably not.  Nah, be kidding.  Probably not.  One of the jurors, uh, said, acknowledged.  One juror didn't agree with the decision.  Uh, she, like I said, she said he paid her a bundle along with the engagement ring that 
[02:25:00]  was really worth a lot of money, said Smith.  So I think it, I think she got to keep the ring on top of this, Jimmy.  That's fucking annoying.  Enough already, right?  I know.  And then we, uh, we, uh, we learned that, uh, oh, someone's annoyed that you were just,  uh, hobnobbing the banana.  Annoyed why?  Making a lot of, like, smacking and, oh, yeah.  Smacking and noises.  Wow.  That bugs him like this?  Does he mean this?  People go fuck themselves. 
[02:25:30]  Hey, there's a superhero.  He's just all eat bananas just to make him kill himself.  Let's point out the haters.  Hater!  Hater.  Uh, we, we got a, we got a superhero named Robert E.  What's your, what's your last, uh, your middle name there?  Me?  Yeah.  Oh, P.  Oh.  Patrick.  Well, there's a Robert E. Kelly that's a superhero.  I give it to you.  Oh, you got it in front of you.  Oh, yeah, here it is.  Robert E. Kelly, Marvel Comics.  Mmm.  That's hilarious. 
[02:26:00]  Looks just like me.  He's the vice president of the United States.  He's able to leave tall speed bumps and make buffets disappear.  Yeah.  Well, in the history, you kept trying, didn't you?  I sure did.  Yeah.  Actually, uh, in the-  He looks exactly like me if my mother fucks somebody else.  In the history of this character, it does say the Goblin Queen.  Right there, the Goblin Queen.  We got it.  Say right, right there, Bob.  The Goblin Queen. 
[02:26:30]  Here's who Bob President was, Bob Kelly was.  He was widowed.  He was, uh, 5'10", 175.  It's a title.  Vice President Kelly was actually in control of the White House, utilizing the actual president  as a puppet front man.  So you were the guy behind the power of the White House.  Yes, but the Goblin Queen found out and corrupted him, taking control of the United States government  and bending it to do her will. 
[02:27:00]  And I'm actually talking to Jimmy in this caption.  Oh, yeah, there's a little, uh, voice bubble that says, yes, my queen.  This is actually the guy from, uh, for all of you who are familiar with the X-Men movie,  this is the senator that ends up turning into a mutant.  Oh, really?  Yeah, this is him.  He doesn't, um, he doesn't-  The guy who has the consistency of Jimmy?  The water guy.  Just like Jell-O gelatin?  My client deserves an apology, senator!  He doesn't have the, um, he doesn't have the jersey-style jewelry that the real Bobby 
[02:27:30]  Kelly wears.  The enormous watch.  Don't get too into it.  We got it.  We got it, Mike.  Big watch.  I don't like him.  He actually tried to use that joke in the hallway in here, and he tried again on air,  and it still didn't work.  We were in the elevator, and Bobby bumps into someone with his watch.  My watch hit some guy's asshole.  And then he apologizes, I'm sorry, I have a big watch.  It was actually my cock. 
[02:28:00]  I didn't want him to know.  I noticed a lot of you comedians had the big watches, though.  Who has one?  Do you want to know how long you've been on stage?  Jimmy wears a big watch?  I have a watch.  I don't actually ever look at it.  It's this big, the thing.  That's a big watch.  Oh, your Armani watch.  Patrice has a big one, I think, right?  Don't wear an Armani watch.  Yeah, Patrice's watch is kind of like mine.  It was all diamonds.  Yeah, Patrice has the bling.  But they're diamonds, like one diamond that was smashed into a million pieces,  and they sprinkled it over the watch.  Oh, is that it?  Like dust, like a glaze?  Yeah, they have purple diamonds. 
[02:28:30]  Relax.  They put it in a sock and hit it with a hammer.  It's actually just...  Fucking ghetto watch.  Ghetto watch.  It's just college sugar cubes just smashed up.  Hey, we got to say hi to Bobby Lee.  He's just pacing out there.  Is he here?  Where is he?  Bobby, what are you doing out there?  Oh, I didn't...  By the coffee machine or something?  I wouldn't drink that coffee.  No one has drank that coffee in months, Bobby.  I thought that was Bobby Lee, and then I started questioning how much I can differentiate  Asians. 
[02:29:00]  I want to...  Bobby, what are you doing?  We'll get you some Starbucks.  Don't drink that coffee.  He just tripped.  Why are you tripping?  Hey!  How you doing, man?  He's doing a fucking Dick Van Dyke entrance.  Pull up a comfy chair.  Hey, how are you?  How are you?  How come Mike didn't get a hug?  That was the awkward chair.  That was the awkward chair. 
[02:29:30]  Bobby Lee gave a hey and a really good hug to Robert Kelly.  A hey and a really good hug to Jimmy.  And then just looked at Mike and went...  Mike, you want a hug, man?  Nah, it's not.  Not going to be on right now, dog.  Why didn't you...  Nah, it's cool.  It's not, man.  The moment's over.  But it was funny, because Mike's arm went out and hugged most...  Like, like...  Oh, no, you fucking...  And then he put it in a handshake, like...  No, you fucking revised history.  That did not happen.  That would have been hilarious if it happened, but it's not what happened.  Is that wrong, isn't it?  No, you gave me, like, nom eyes, you know what I mean?  Like, when I was a nom, right? 
[02:30:00]  And then you were going to stab me or something.  So, like, I know these two, you know what I mean?  Oh, you guys don't know each other?  No, I mean, no.  I'm a fan.  I just, you know what I mean?  It was awkward.  I'm sorry.  I'm a fan?  What the heck happened?  What the fuck is that?  Should I start over?  What are we in?  What, are we in Hollywood?  You just say, I'm a fan to everybody?  Hey, I'm a fan.  Hey, look, I'm just a fan.  Dude, that is so true about Hollywood.  Yeah, everybody's a fucking fan, and then behind each other's backs just stab each other.  You see some obscure soap opera star on Sunset Boulevard. 
[02:30:30]  Hey, I'm a fan.  I've never seen your work.  I've just seen your picture in a couple magazines.  Big fan.  You run into Rod Stewart.  Big fan.  All the albums.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of your stomach contents, Rod.  Thank you so much.  Bobby, you're going to be at Caroline's, I think?  Yeah.  All right, right on.  Bobby Lee at Caroline's.  All right.  Is that it?  Am I gone now?  There you go.  They're telling us Bobby has to go.  If anyone wants to know who Bobby is, he's the Asian guy on Mad TV that no one watches? 
[02:31:00]  No one watches the Asian guy or the Mad TV in general?  What's wrong with you, Mike?  No, everyone says it's still Bobby.  I love Bobby.  Look, dude, he made good in the show.  I like Mad TV.  I want him.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  I gave you a hug, dude.  Hold on.  Name one skit from Mad TV.  Yeah, you're a fan, right?  Yeah, I like the girl who does the Asian lady.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's gone.  She's been gone for eight years.  I like the guy who takes...  He's been gone for eight years. 
[02:31:30]  I don't like that.  He's a fan.  He's a fan.  I'm not a fan.  He's a huge fan.  I'm not a fan of the show you're on.  When it first started, it was fucking great.  Not Sucks.  Yeah, Mike.  How long is that show?  We're going to our 14th year.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's on Comedy Central all the time now, right?  I can't believe you just try to play it off like you're a fan.  I am.  And then they ask for one sketch.  The girl left nine years ago.  I like the new guy, the black guy who delivers the stuff.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's funny.  Name me a character that I do, Robert.  I like when you play the girl.  Any Asian girl you play, you just look like a guy.  Like what?  Name one. 
[02:32:00]  Name one Asian girl character.  Ming Lao?  I don't know.  He was just trying to stick up for Bobby.  Thank you, Robert.  Thank you.  Bobby's hilarious.  I'm just saying.  It's not a well-viewed show.  Yeah, it does okay, though.  It's not like we get like nine Mexicans in the net.  Wow.  At least this show is viewed.  You can't stop watching.  Jesus.  Wow.  Hey, hold on, Bob.  That was a real slam by Bob because Mike's got a very sensitive spot.  He did a CBS pilot, which was supposed to be very good, but they rejected it. 
[02:32:30]  And Bob just made fun of him saying that at least yours gets viewed.  So that's kind of a soft spot.  Well, you know, I probably should stay out of this because I don't have anything going  on.  I'm at the cellar this weekend, Friday and Saturday night, three shows Friday, four shows.  Michael Hitchcock did do my show, right?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Michael Hitchcock did do my show.  Yeah.  He's on Mad TV.  He played the veterinarian on my show.  Yeah, yeah.  I love how not in the industry that Bobby is that he says, my pilot got canceled.  As though we're even on TV in the first place.  I just admitted that.  You're actually right.  Mike's pilot got canceled. 
[02:33:00]  What are you, a fucking impressionist now, jackass?  He rode a value jet on it and dropped it in the fucking fly.  I was like, what was it about?  He did one good impression of his girlfriend, and then you think he can just whip it around?  I like the new Mike Birbigli.  I think he's been brushing up on the O&A culture.  He's a mean motherfucker today.  Come in here and fucking bare your teeth.  My friend Mike sincerely said it was amazing, the show.  Hitchcock, yeah.  He said that you were very funny.  He's a talented guy.  He's the guy in Best in Show.  He was...  No, Michael Hitchcock is this guy. 
[02:33:30]  Which guy in Best in Show?  He played Parker Posey's husband in Best in Show.  Oh, fuck yeah.  The braces?  Hysterical.  I like your mustache.  Fuck yeah.  Thanks, dude.  Yeah, I'm going for the 70s porn look.  Yeah, I can't grow anything, man.  70s coming back.  It is coming back.  With a vengeance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Trying to get AIDS.  Doing everything.  My show is loosely based on the period of my life, like many years ago.  Not is, was.  What?  Not is, was.  Shut up.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying. 
[02:34:00]  Mike Turner is just like, what?  I'm just saying.  I love this in Mike.  So the listeners know.  Just because people hear your voice saying boring shit doesn't mean they're going to buy  more of your albums, Bobby.  I'm just saying, Mike.  I'm just saying, Mike.  Jim, to answer your question that you asked me.  I'm just saying it's is.  Are you serious?  I'm just saying.  You're going to keep going with this babbling shit?  I'm just saying.  That's all.  That's all.  My gym, was I just saying?  Yeah.  Just saying.  I don't know why you're getting so angry, Mike.  Awkward.  Yeah, you get very angry real quick.  What's wrong? 
[02:34:30]  Not angry.  Hey, don't do that psycho smile.  Maybe because Mike was in the middle of saying something.  Don't do that psycho I'm angry smile.  Maybe because Mike was in the middle of saying something and you decided to just chime in  over him.  Oh, so I'm sorry.  That's the way the show works.  He talks.  Then you talk.  Then I talk.  Nobody just jumps in and says funny shit.  Don't fuck yourself, you thin guinea.  No.  Funny shit is really subjective.  Hey, sometimes it's funny.  Sometimes it's not.  It's a little uncomfortable.  Fat guinea.  I'm Irish.  Not Irish.  You look like a guinea. 
[02:35:00]  How are you saying you're Irish?  He's adopted by Irish people.  I know.  So you're not Irish.  You're lucky to be fucking Italian.  You're probably Puerto Rican.  Colin said that my great, great grandmother got raped on the Khyber Pass.  The Khyber Pass.  Who is a fucking Colin?  Exactly.  Colin.  That's Colin.  Colin said my favorite slam of Bobby was Colin said Bobby should be dancing in a grass  skirt entertaining Australian tourists.  No, he's saying, I don't know, whatever.  What about the one? 
[02:35:30]  Did I say it wrong?  Yeah, he said it wrong.  He said, I look like, I look, I look, oh, go ahead.  What's the other one he said about him in a, in a gift shop?  That's the one.  He mixed it up.  That's what he said.  That's what he said.  That's what you get from a gift shop.  No, that's the new one.  But what was the other one?  That was Bobby?  The last minute gift at an airport coming back from?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hawaii.  No, it wasn't Hawaii.  No, it was China.  Colin was dressed in the grass skirt for the Halloween show.  And then I said that the grass skirt was actually his Comedy Central contract that they shredded.  Yeah, but he did say you should be dancing to make Australian tourists happy. 
[02:36:00]  And like a tongue in the tongue and something.  He just, it was very funny.  Last minute gift in a gift shop coming back from China.  I don't know.  Yeah, you know.  There you go.  I'm going to have to read it off of a teleprompter.  Last minute gift.  Can we get back to my particular?  To answer your question, Jim.  Thanks, Bobby, for the interruption.  But the...  Jesus, you're still on there, you little fucking angry cunt.  Just go.  Let us go.  Just say it.  I'm right here.  It's this period of my life where I was living with my girlfriend, my girlfriend at the time. 
[02:36:30]  And I knew she wanted to get married, but it was this unspoken thing.  And then we went to my brother's wedding, and they asked us to be in a photo.  And they said, do you want Abby in the photo?  And I said, yes.  But there was like this pause.  You're literally going to cry.  Oh, it's a true story.  It's real, you know.  Your pause freaked her out.  Yeah.  And then we got home that night.  We were living together, and she goes, you know, is this serious?  And I was like, yeah, of course it's serious.  I love you.  And she was like, you know, are we going to get married?  And I was like, yeah.  And then she was like, when? 
[02:37:00]  And what I should have said was, can we talk about this next summer?  And what I did say was, next summer.  And then she called everyone we knew and told them we were getting married.  And that's how I got engaged without getting engaged.  And so the sitcom is actually about this wedding that's never going to happen.  And you know it's not going to happen.  And everybody and the people watching knows it's not going to happen, but she doesn't know.  What was the name of the show?  It was the Untitled Mike Birbiglia Project.  Who played the chick?  This girl, Christine Woods, who's on Kelsey Grammer's pilot, which might go this fall. 
[02:37:30]  She's real talented.  And like Bob Odenkirk played my brother.  And, you know, Mike Hitchcock played the vet.  And like it was like the mother from Six Feet Under played my mom.  It was like pretty surreal working with all these people.  So, yeah, that's all I got.  Were they hard on you, like the producers and stuff?  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to make it.  That's why I'm doing a one-person show in New York this fall,  because it's my show and I get to decide what's in the show versus television 
[02:38:00]  where people just, it's like someone trying to find a vein in you at the hospital  and you're just poking you and you're like, ah, okay.  You know, you're just taking it.  Does that analogy make sense at all?  Yes, it reminds me.  It's like I like to do, that's why I like the freedom of stand-up.  Like my new CD, Edgy As I Wanna Be.  How many years have you been on? 
[02:38:30]  I'm not an interviewer, I'm just joking.  What?  How many years have you been on Met TV?  This is my eighth year.  Damn, man.  Dude, this is it.  After this, I'm dead.  You're done?  Yeah, I'm like dead in the business.  Has anyone been on the whole time?  No.  Caliendo's gone, right?  Yeah, Caliendo left.  Everyone wants to leave once they're there.  Does he still have his own sitcom on CBS?  I just did a pilot myself, but I don't see it.  Oh, you did?  It's not gonna get picked, no.  Why would I get picked?  It's like weird.  What is it?  It's just like a lot of Asians dancing around naked and stuff.  It's not too weird.  You and Steve Byrne and Dr. Ken?  Yeah, Steve Byrne's not fully Asian. 
[02:39:00]  He's like a light Mexican kind of looking.  His father looks like, his father's real Irish.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the Carlos Mencia of Asians.  We're gonna bring that up?  Please don't bring that up.  Let's say hi to John in Illinois.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The video, every time I'm on the radio, the video thing with him and Rogan, that thing comes  up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, not on this show, my friend.  You put it on the spot.  You guys are classy.  You put it on the spot.  But you brought it up.  I did.  Why did I bring it up?  Yeah.  Didn't you just bring it up?  I did.  I think I just did.  I didn't. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you brought it up.  Let's just move on, please.  Hey, Bobby, you got anything boring to say?  This would be a good time for that.  Now, if Bob said one answer fucking with, he would have said, yes, Mike for Big Mac.  Goddamn you, Bob.  Goddamn you, man.  Thanks for helping, though.  I know you're a gentleman.  Hey, Robert, the reason why I play girls on the show is because it's a parody show.  There's not a lot of Asian dudes out there, so whenever there's a girl, I got to play  that girl.  The Asian girl.  No, I love when you play Asian girls.  You're actually cute. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, you play her real well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In fact, if I was a chick, if I was, I'd get laid more.  Do Asian guys really have a problem getting pussy?  Because Asian women can, Asian women fuck, and I talked to a couple of Asian guys, but  Asian women will fuck black guys, white guys, Spanish guys.  Yeah.  But white girls won't fuck Asian guys.  That's not true.  That's not true.  Really?  That's absolutely not true.  So you bang white girls?  Yeah.  Do you bang Asian girls?  I bang all kinds of girls.  And the reason why, here's what it is.  It's this.  You got to do a launching pad.  And what a launching pad is, is I tell Asian dudes that haven't been laid, you get a prostitute 
[02:40:30]  first.  Right?  And that gets your, you know, your shit moving.  Right?  And the girls sense that you're having sex, and then they're in the game.  Every guy that I send to a prostitute to, they get laid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From the prostitute.  No, I mean, after.  No, you're paying.  Yeah.  No, I mean, after.  After.  Because they get into the, you know, the routine of it.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes it takes 30 times.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  You go to Tijuana, right? 
[02:41:00]  It's $60.  You go to Adelita.  Tijuana's disgusting.  Just listen, Robert.  I went to Tijuana, and the girl had a white nougat on her asshole.  And then she turned around and goes, go ahead, if you want to, go ahead, lick it.  I was like, I almost puked.  You know me.  Ugh.  What was it?  I like when they bring out the Bob Kelly with a bridle and have it fuck one of the women  on stage.  Oh.  It was actually called a health club.  Really?  Yeah, it was a health club, but they had two dumbbells and a thigh master.  That's what they had. 
[02:41:30]  Very good.  Heard that, Jimmy.  Hey, let's go back to Bobby Lee.  Yeah.  I was like, the Asian dudes, right?  They're like, a lot of them are conservative and stuff, and they, you know, they, you know,  they're doctors, and they're in computers and stuff like that.  Right.  And there's, you have those Asians, and then you have my kind of Asians.  I think those kind, you know, the kind of drug addicts and the, you know what I mean?  Opium guys, you know?  They, I think we kind of get girls.  So you go down to Tijuana to what place again?  Adelita and the Chicago Club.  Yeah.  It's on Coahuila Street. 
[02:42:00]  You know, they're across the street from each other.  And then back of Adelita, there's a place called Hooker Alley, where all the underage girls  lean up, lean up against the wall.  It's creepy.  Do they arrest you for that in Mexico?  Do they set you up and arrest you?  I'm surprised they don't fuck people.  No, no, no.  They don't.  You walk down, you don't, I mean, if you go down Hooker Alley and you grab a girl,  you're going to hell.  Because those girls are too young, but like, I've walked down it.  For who?  What?  Too young for who?  Yeah, exactly.  What are you talking about?  Mexican, it's another country.  It's the metric system. 
[02:42:30]  That's right, she's six chili-years.  Let's go to John in Illinois.  John.  Hey.  Hey.  What's happening, fellas?  First of all, Opie and Anthony, I just want to thank you for everything that you've exposed  me to.  Aunt Tane, Jim Norton, Rich Boss, Lucky Louie.  I saw you, Jimmy, in Chicago in April.  You were friggin' fantastic at the Lakeshore Theater.  Thank you.  Hotter than hell.  Thanks.  Oh, yeah, it was very warm.  Huge fan, man.  I just, I love you guys so much.  I listen to you every day. 
[02:43:00]  All right, get to the point.  Not enough.  Bobby Lee.  Yeah?  I think he's an awesome comedian.  The favorite skit that I like on Mad TV is when he was Tank.  Oh, Tank.  I'm from the club pimping in his day woo.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys rock, man.  Thanks a lot.  I hope you're going to ask me.  Take care, bro.  All right, John.  There was a distinct omission of me in that phone call, and I'm not going to point it  out, but...  What happened?  Well, he just kind of went around the room and complimented everybody.  All right.  And said nothing.  But I like that die.  I like the day woo sketch. 
[02:43:30]  I like the sound of that.  I love the new Berviglia, man.  Don't you do that...  Don't you do that bit with the guy that looks like Mark Wahlberg there on the show?  Which one?  Do you mean Ike Berenholtz?  Who's the guy that looks like Mark Wahlberg?  Mike Ike, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He left.  He left the show.  Eight years ago, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I love how we're all trying to prove that we watch his show.  No, we're proving we all watch it on Comedy Central.  No, nobody watches the show.  I realize I'm a part of a loser show, but it's just like, what am I going to do? 
[02:44:00]  I don't think anybody watches it first run, but I think we've all seen it on Comedy Central.  Yeah, they're playing the old episodes on.  And you're hilarious, dude.  No one's criticizing your credibility as a comedian.  I understand.  Thank you.  Here.  Here comes the log.  Hey, where's the...  That was weird.  What the...  Is Harry spiritual on?  No.  How many years was he on?  He was on for eight, too.  How long has he been gone?  He's been gone for like three years.  But let me tell you something.  That dude...  Wow.  That gave him to say hi to me for three years.  Yeah, I heard you had problems when you first got on the show, like they treated you like shit? 
[02:44:30]  Dude, I showed up on the show and literally producers would say, dude, we're going to do everything we can to get you off the show.  Why?  Because they're like, we don't know.  You're not from Sketch.  You've never acted before.  We think that, you know what I mean?  Stand-ups don't work on the show.  And I literally, that first two years...  That's why I went to rehab my second year, because I was just drugged out.  I hate those fucking...  Sketch people have this fucking arrogance.  Some of them are brilliantly funny.  But they have, you know, I've had enough of these motherfuckers. 
[02:45:00]  They have this arrogance.  They do Sketch, these faggots, because they can't stand alone on a stage most of them.  So they have a fucking resentment against stand-ups.  And again, Sketch people, I have respect for them, because what they do is an art, and it's hard.  But their resentments of stand-ups make me want to fucking spit in their faces.  Fuck you when you're fucking needing somebody else up there.  Stand by yourself.  Is that a...  Are we cutting a commercial?  What is that?  I've heard that shit before.  They have this resentment against stand-ups.  Dude, and whenever I go up by myself in front of a live audience, I get off, and all the  Sketchwork guys are like, you seem very comfortable on stage. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I'm a performer.  Like, I'm not afraid of them.  I don't need to pretend I'm in an office.  What was the drug that got you into rehab?  I used to start drinking Vicodin, man.  Vicodin?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I started taking like 20 of them, 25 of them a day.  Really?  I started drinking, yeah.  How often did you not shit?  You must have not shit at all.  Dude, I tell you, the last...  Okay, two days before my last sketch, I quit doing Vicodin, and I had to play Connie Chung.  And this is everyone knows, right?  So I'm in Connie Chung, and I'm detoxing, right? 
[02:46:00]  I'm in front of a live audience, and I'm shaking, right?  The lights come on.  The director goes, all right, action.  I go, good evening.  I'm Connie.  And then I shit my pants.  I shit my pants, right?  And then they go, cut.  And all the wardrobe come out, and they're cleaning the shit off my nylons and stuff.  How'd they know you shit?  They heard it?  No, dude, you could smell it.  And I'm sweating, and I'm shaking.  Then one of the producers, Dick Blasucci, walks up to me, starts screaming at me.  He goes, you're gonna do it!  You're gonna finish it!  Because the next day I was going to rehab, right?  It took me two hours to do a three-minute sketch. 
[02:46:30]  They did it line by line in front of 300 people.  Is that...  Can we watch that?  Is that out there?  Yeah, it's out there.  Just to know that you shit your pants?  No, there's an edited that aired, but you can literally...  It's the worst sketch I've ever done.  Let's get it on TV.  Let's get it up here.  We gotta watch this now.  Hey, Bobby, I'm a fan of when you shit your pants, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  That sketch where you shit your pants, I'm a fan.  When I had a...  Remember when I had that bad toothache, and I went upstairs to the dentist up there?  I do remember, yes.  And he wrote me a prescription for Vicodin, and I got it, went home, and I took one. 
[02:47:00]  And the second it hit me, the first thing I did was count how many I had left.  I was like, one, two, three, okay.  That's amazing.  If I break one in half, and then I'll have more, and I'll...  That shit is great!  Great!  How good is it for...  Because I gotta get sinus surgery in August.  I don't know what they're gonna give me for pain, but I'm gonna have to take something.  Don't take it.  Yeah.  I have to.  You should.  Yeah, you're gonna take it, but don't...  I'm an addict to recovery.  I'm a martyr.  You're an addictive personality. 
[02:47:30]  Having my septum fucking straight and interbinate shakes.  I took it when I took my knee, and I went through the shakes.  I'll take whatever they give me for medicinal...  I have to.  I'm not a martyr.  You need St. Joseph's baby aspirin.  What do you take for pain?  That's the only thing you can take, because you're an addictive personality.  You love everything.  I throw them out before the prescriptions are done.  Take morphine.  It's light.  No, no.  I don't fuck with prescriptions.  But when you have surgery, you gotta take it.  I'm not gonna suffer and not take...  What, over-the-counter painkillers?  Well, what do some addicts do in your case?  Most of them will take the prescribed amount only. 
[02:48:00]  Take the pain!  Take the pain.  Take the pain!  You take the prescribed amount only, and you maybe have somebody help you out with it  and give it to you if you're married, or you fucking just throw them out.  Like, I always throw them out when the pain stops as opposed to in the pill.  Are there people that refuse all pain medications because they're too scared?  I won't.  I don't know.  Maybe.  You don't help with witnesses, but I don't fuck with that.  Yeah, Mormons and...  Oh, shit.  Well, you call your sponsor.  That's what I would do.  Yeah, you have to do.  Yeah, somebody, yeah.  I'm not gonna suffer through fucking post-surgical pain.  No one ever expects you to do that.  Of course not. 
[02:48:30]  Let's go to Kathy in South Carolina.  That's a tough nut.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hi, Kath.  Talking about Vicodin and all sorts of shit.  Yes.  Waiting for Mike from Biglia to hit somebody.  You know, we got a good one right now.  This is a good one.  Well, I was talking about Bobby Lee's skits.  Uh-oh.  What, baby?  My skits?  Bobby Lee's skits?  Yeah?  I'm here.  I'm like 24.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you very much.  He hasn't done that skit in five years.  No, no, no, no.  No, I do like two a year. 
[02:49:00]  But thank you.  Yeah, I watch the new ones that come on.  I don't watch the reruns.  Oh, do you like them or no?  Oh, I watch that instead of Saturday Night Live.  Oh, thank you.  That's a compliment.  What's your name, miss?  Kathy.  We're glad you watched the show, but on the phone, you're a real snooze fest.  I'm sorry.  I'm just kidding.  I'm from South.  I guess that's what, you know, we're like.  All right.  Hey, so nobody, Bobby, nobody was nice to you when you got there?  No, no, no.  It was the worst two, three years of my life.  And then what happened was, then like, you know, fans started going, we like the little 
[02:49:30]  guy, you know what I mean?  And then all of a sudden, it kind of changed.  And also, the old people left.  And then when the new people came in, then I was like.  You were there.  Yeah, I was already there.  And then you had, you have a little power and stuff.  But dude, the first two years, I literally was going to Virginia Tech the whole place.  Oh, shit.  Are you friends with him now?  No.  Are you friends with him now?  Oh, no.  Yeah, I see him.  And then, you know, he grows my head.  Oh, is that the bit?  Yeah, let's go.  Let's watch this.  It's on YouTube.  Is this the one?  Wow. 
[02:50:00]  I don't know if that's it.  It's TV, Connie Chung, and Joe Millionaire.  That's hilarious.  Is that the one?  No, no, no.  Aries and Moe were in it.  I don't think it's on YouTube, but that's me.  Everything's on YouTube.  Have they ever, on MADtv, have they ever considered casting Alfred E. Newman as an actor?  Is that funny?  Please hold.  Dude, we have nothing to do with MADtv.  Oh, you don't?  No, I mean, they bought the rights to the name, but then like, all that other stuff.  I didn't even know that. 
[02:50:30]  I was just going to use it as a platform for my bad jokes.  Let's say hi to Elizabeth in Philly.  Elizabeth, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  My mother-in-law just had this surgery on her sinuses, and for like two weeks afterwards,  she sounded like a whistle.  It was pretty funny.  Moments like that, right?  And happy birthday, baby.  Thank you.  Ooh.  She called you baby.  She sure did. 
[02:51:00]  Is your mother breathing better, though?  Your mother-in-law?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was that again?  Is your mother-in-law breathing better?  Um, I think so.  Um, I really can't stand her.  I wish she would stop breathing, but yeah, she is breathing.  Oh, wow.  The real dirt comes out, huh?  Yeah, so I hope you do well with your surgery, babe.  Thank you, ma'am.  All right.  Let's do it.  All right.  Bye.  Fucking mensch.  Well, she's better now.  Hope the old cunt was killed by a drum truck.  Hell, you're on one.  Let's go to Mike in Nashville. 
[02:51:30]  We got Bobby Lee playing Carolines this weekend here in New York City.  The number is 212-757-4100.  Thank you.  Carolines.  Mike?  Yeah, I was going to call and say, Bobby Lee, you're a fucking genius, man.  Oh, thanks.  My favorite skit is Average Asian.  Uh-huh.  That shit is hilarious.  Thank you.  Yeah.  But yeah, well, Average Asian was one of those things.  It was during the time with no one liked me.  So that was the only thing that they would give me is this thing called Average Asian 
[02:52:00]  where I, you know, like stereotypes would come up and I'd be like,  I don't know what's going on, you know.  But thank you very much.  How many weeks here do you guys shoot?  Do you want an episode a week for how many weeks?  Well, it used to be 22 and now it's only 14.  This year they gave us only 14.  It's done after this year.  I cannot see it coming back.  Really?  Yeah.  Literally, dude, there's homeless people sleeping outside my dressing room.  There's no security.  I don't even know what's going on.  I can't even get in, you know.  Wow.  It sounds like XM ghetto.  You would have done really well in the 80s during that period where there's always an 
[02:52:30]  Asian character in movies, like in Real Genius, like the Asian guy who lives in the dorm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who makes it like a skating rink in the hallway.  It's a great movie.  Does your money drop?  No, that's why I go do it.  That's the only reason.  I mean, that's the only reason why I do it.  You know, it's just because they go, here's this.  And I'm like, all right, I'll take it.  Are you still doing the Kims of comedy?  No, they kicked me out of the group.  They kicked you out?  They kicked you out?  What's the Kims of comedy?  Steve Byrne's group.  Yeah, it's all Asians that tour the country. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, well, it was mine, and then I got kicked out, and now it's Steve.  Who kicked you out?  Why?  Well, me and Steve are very good friends, and I love them.  But I wouldn't do, like, you know, they were doing this.  Do you like the fact that his hair looks like a Lego person to make?  That fucking hairdo should be removed by Ezra.  Horrendous.  I wouldn't do this, like, you know, this college showcase, you know, for free.  You know how they do those, what do they call them?  NACAs?  NACAs?  Yeah.  You've got to fly for free to showcase, and I'm like, we're not doing that. 
[02:53:30]  You know what I mean?  We proved that we can sell out.  You know what I mean?  Why would we have to showcase?  And that was the reason you left the group?  No, they were like, well, if you don't do the showcase, then you can't reap the benefits  of us doing, you know, getting the gigs from the show.  Aren't you the biggest name, though, being on TV?  So wouldn't your name on the bill be a benefit that they couldn't contribute?  Because who else is on it?  Someone could just throw money for your flight.  Who cares?  I know.  But the thing is, is that now, but now I talked to Steve three days ago, and, you know, we're  going to do some days again.  Who else is on it?  Steve, and who else?  Dr. Ken, you know him?  Dr. Ken's really funny. 
[02:54:00]  He's very funny.  What do you...  And this kid named Kevin Shane, nobody knows him.  I know Kevin.  I love him.  I know Kevin.  He's the best.  What do you think of people getting in trouble for doing stereotypical humor, Bobby Lee?  Dude, like, I used to be Mencia's opening act, so it's just like, that's how I was raised,  to seeing that kind of stuff, so I don't really know.  Seeing what kind of stuff?  It's weird, because it's like now, like, there's a lot of New York guys that move to  L.A., and I've learned more from them.  Like, guys like Bill Burr than I have from L.A. comics, you know what I mean?  Because, you know, it's like sitting there, it doesn't have... 
[02:54:30]  You don't have to have a punchline, and before, like, you know, I was so worried about killing,  you know what I mean, like Mencia does, that now it's like, I'd rather just kind of take  my time and be more honest and stuff, you know?  What do you learn from Bill?  How to repress childhood memories and not bite the face of people around you?  No, dude, it was good.  Yeah, Bill Burr, we love him.  Oh, what a psycho.  Bill.  Well, I asked that because Richard Belzer disappointed the hell out of me.  I was watching the last comic standing, I literally watched like two episodes, and I caught this 
[02:55:00]  one where there was a Korean woman.  Yeah, Esther Koo.  Doing all Korean humor, getting huge laughs, and they had no problem with it because she's  Korean.  Yeah.  Then you had this white guy do this whole, like, Asian stereotypical bit, and Richard  Belzer gave the guy a talking to, saying that type of humor doesn't fly in 2008.  Right.  I couldn't believe Belzer would go down that road.  Do we have tape of that?  Was he saying that?  I've been trying to find this clip to play on the show.  It's got to be a less comic standing.  It's got to be gettable. 
[02:55:30]  I mean, was he saying it was a pointy bit, or was he saying it was, like, inappropriate?  It was inappropriate.  Stereotypical humor from a white guy doesn't fly in the year 2008.  And I'm like, wow, that's weird.  And then two comedians later, it's the Korean girl doing pretty much the same type of stuff.  Yeah, she's funny, but my problem with her is that if you do stereotypical stuff about  your own race, you have to be positive.  You have to, you know what I mean?  You have to make Asians look good.  She doesn't.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And she rips on all the negative stuff.  And her bit about, like, how Asian guys can't, like you were saying, you know, Asian guys, 
[02:56:00]  we're going to be, Asian guys are going to be extinct because no one wants to have sex  with them.  I mean, you can't play shit like that.  It's fucking hilarious and true.  No, no, no, no, you don't.  As a white guy, it's pretty funny.  It's based in fact.  A huge Asian girl.  Applause break.  It's based in fact and funniness.  Bobby's right.  Sit down.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Bobby.  Bobby, come back.  Bobby Lee got his biggest laugh by quoting another female Asian comedian.  Bobby was looking for our support on that one. 
[02:56:30]  That's a hilarious joke.  Shit's always want to fuck Asian guys, man.  You see, there's a lot of Asian porn.  That's for sure.  Not one Asian porn guy with white chicks.  But he's got that great solution with the hookers.  I mean, it's covered, right?  It's the launching pad.  It works.  The launching pad.  Talk about it, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I don't know why it's always got a...  Is this the cool hot?  Is she a hot chick?  She's hot, yeah.  She's smoker.  She wears tiny little skirts and she plays up her hotness, yeah. 
[02:57:00]  She's a nice little asshole, I bet.  I bet it's...  What does that mean?  Do we have any other material?  Real Asian people are not hairy.  Yeah, but they have that...  Their skin is different than their asshole.  It's like grayer.  Yeah.  It's like really white skin.  And then right now they're asshole and their thigh's gray.  And the genitals are...  Like, my genitals are like now getting black.  Wait, wait.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There she is.  Hi.  Hi.  So my parents are from Korea and I went to Korea once.  It was really weird. 
[02:57:30]  Everybody was Korean.  And my relatives came to pick me up.  I got in the wrong car like 10 times.  You guys think you can't tell us apart?  We can't tell either, you know?  I doubt that.  She looks fuckable.  Oh, she's...  So, but I'm glad I'm here.  Asian girls are dangerous in the States, you know?  Yeah?  I mean, seriously, does anybody in here not have an Asian fetish? 
[02:58:00]  See what I mean?  What?  There's one guy up there?  What is he, gay?  I want to date Esther Kidd.  I want her to be my girlfriend.  I don't know if you guys at home can see this, but there's this guy up here.  He looks like he's surprised to see an Asian in pigtails without punching in his credit card number.  It's kind of fucking funny.  But seriously, Asian girls are going out with, like, white guys, black guys, you know? 
[02:58:30]  Everybody but Asian guys.  Uh-oh.  That's fucking true.  Why's she got a hate?  You know, like, what's going to happen to Asian guys?  They're going to go extinct or something?  As he's sitting at home playing video games?  I'm going to kill her.  I feel bad.  He didn't even quote her best joke and it killed.  Not bad enough to date them.  You know what?  If your dick was big enough, I'd choke her with it. 
[02:59:00]  Like, last week, this Asian guy asked me out and I was just like, jeez, when are they going to realize that Asian girls are just way out of their league?  That's daddy anger.  And my girlfriends are always asking me, they're like, how do you stay so skinny?  And I always tell them, just do what we do, you know?  Eat with chopsticks.  I feel stocked.  We can't pick much up with those things either.  Dude, it's all stocky.  Yeah.  And then shove it down your throat and throw up.  I love her.  She's very fuckable, though.  She's great.  She's doing a fucking, no one can tell him a part joke, a Bolinian joke, a fucking, a jerk off a line joke. 
[02:59:30]  I mean, it's an ancient Korean secret that dog is like 25% more lean than turkey.  Is there a lover?  Duh.  More.  Actually, I don't even know how to use chopsticks.  Like, I'm completely American.  I was born here.  I mean, I'm so American, I'm against immigration.  Because I'm here already. 
[03:00:00]  And I ordered Chinese yesterday and a Mexican guy delivered it.  And I opened up the fortune cookie. 
[03:00:30]  It said, Confucius say, no hablo ingles.  I want to put her in a wedding dress and just shit in her mouth.  I was like, this is crazy.  I have to get him back.  So tomorrow I want to apply for a job at Taco Bell.  Like, you want sweet and sour sauce with your chalupa?  So it's cool being here.  Whenever I miss my grandparents, though, I could always turn on the TV and watch reruns of Man.  Oh, shit. 
[03:01:00]  Holy shit.  That's pretty funny.  Me so funny.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  I'm Esther Koo.  I like it, man.  Esther Koo.  But every joke has something to do with her being Korean.  And that can't be a part of your trip.  The whole thing.  It's the entire act.  I mean, I do half of it.  But it's just like, you know.  I love that Bobby comes in and he's like, I got a real issue with this Esther Koo we play.  And everyone's like, yeah.  This rules. 
[03:01:30]  When's the album coming in?  She's cute.  She's everything.  I know.  You're just.  I'm wrong.  Baby, I'm wrong.  She reminds me of a black.  Do you know the black girl, Esther Koon?  Jesus.  We can goof on Asians.  Yes, we can.  You like Asian chicks?  No, I don't have a fetish for any girl.  But she was great.  I enjoyed it very much.  No, I've slept with like two Asian girls in my life.  Typically, no.  We've got to find the Bells.  That's one more than me, man.  Really?  I like that French comedian, Esther Koo d'Etat. 
[03:02:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, I will be appearing.  She's crazy, though.  There's no dates to speak of.  She's always chilly.  It's Esther Koo.  It's Esther Koo.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  But Bells has said it's okay if you're a part of that group  to make fun of it.  Oh, of course.  That's the way humor should be broken down.  That's fucking bullshit.  Of course.  That's a terrible idea.  I like Bells, but it's like, oh, Richard.  All right.  Let's go to Joey in Louisiana. 
[03:02:30]  Joey.  What's going on, bro?  How do you do, Joe?  Hey, Joey.  Hey, man.  Big fan.  O&A.  Yeah.  Bob Kelly.  Love you.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I don't know who this Mike guy is, but Bobby.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Peace.  Bobby Lee.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  25 a day?  Bike it in.  Yeah.  I don't do it now.  I mean, how the hell did you keep up with 25 a day, my man? 
[03:03:00]  Well, you know, I was on a show, right?  So I had a little bit of money at that time, and I just spent it all on drugs.  I had like three or four people I went to in L.A.  And all the sketch guys.  Well, I can't remember.  I was revealed to me.  I'm like, well, it's...  And, yeah, but I quit, dude.  I was going to die.  A lot of girls watch your show.  You get star pussy.  That's good.  No, I haven't been late in five months, actually.  Come on.  Five months.  My choice, probably, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Because I was in a relationship, and so I had to suffer so much all day. 
[03:03:30]  Are you taking a little time for you?  Well, no.  You know, I'd rather jerk off, honestly.  It's nice, right?  Patrice was saying that yesterday.  No, I...  Patrice O'Neal said the exact same thing.  He said he's reaching the point where the pussy isn't like it was when he was in his  20s, where it was like be all, do all, end all of everything.  The chase isn't worth the actual coming of it.  You know what I mean?  It's like something you chase for 10 hours and stuff, and it's just like...  And after you nut, you're like, that's it?  You know what I mean?  So I'd rather just do it right then, get the juice out, and then move on with my life.  You like to call it the poison. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, the poison, yeah.  Get the poison out.  Spice it up.  You should just come inside them and see what happens.  Yeah.  It mixes things up.  The same hand on the neck.  Strangle them a little bit.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You just got to get kickier.  But you know what?  You got to manipulate, and sometimes you got to buy dinner and all that stuff, and it's  just like the...  It's a whole thing.  You have to buy dinner still?  You're fucking famous, and you got money, and you still have to buy him dinner?  You can't just say, come to my pad?  When you're on SNL, you don't have to buy him dinner, but on TV, you have to buy him  dinner.  Let's say hi. 
[03:04:30]  You're not...  Oh, shit.  Let's say hi to David in Michigan.  David.  Oh, and hey, before I found you guys and was turned to the wonderful dark side of your  humor, I listened to fucking Bob and Tom.  I heard Mike Birbiglia on there, and I thought, yeah, he's okay.  He's kind of funny.  But I'll tell you what, the dark side Mike Birbiglia fucking rocks.  I love it.  Yeah, this is a different side of you today, Mike.  It's early.  It's early?  It's before I'm really awake.  Yeah.  He's getting his chops.  I love it.  All right, cool. 
[03:05:00]  All right, we got Bobby Lee, Caroline's all weekend long, 212-757-4100.  I think we're going to step aside, do a little break, maybe do material.  I don't know.  We're just hanging.  Continue with this.  I want the bells a clip.  We got so many comedians in studio today.  I would love to get your opinion of what he said, but we can't find it for some reason.  But if someone has it out there, email it to us if you're DVRing.  If you're DVRing.  I think I have the episode.  I just got to run the back.  Really?  You think you got it?  I think I know which one it is now. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  The guy puts on these weird glasses to look really Asian.  He's doing like a Japanese fighter pilot thing.  Oh, you found it.  Well, sort of.  I have the info on now.  I just got to pull the clip.  All right.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Hopefully, we'll have the clip after the break.  Somebody needs to help him. 
[03:06:00]  Every knee must bend.  Every head must bow.  Every tongue must confess.  Thou art the greatest.  The greatest of all time.  Ella.  Ella.  Ay.  Ay.  Yeah, we suck.  Opium Anthony, y'all.  Good evening.  I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.  I'm standing on the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.  It's Saturday morning, October 26th, 1985.  118 AM.  And this is temporal experiment number one.  Coming this weekend to the Saturday Night Virus, directly following The Laszlo Show, 
[03:06:30]  it's the secret show to the future.  We're going to watch Back to the Future in studio, live, on the air.  You're going to do the same exact thing at your house, just like syncing up Pink Floyd's  The Wall with The Wizard of Oz.  And you don't have to worry about any kind of delay or not matching up with us, because  we're going to tell you when to hit play.  So even though there's eight seconds delay, and even though it takes time for our voices  to go into XM, into the satellites, and then into space, and then back down into your radios,  it doesn't matter, because I'm going to tell you, we're going to go 3, 2, 1, and go. 
[03:07:00]  So you're going to be synced up at your house, because you're going to press play when we  tell you, and you're going to actually be listening to things that we say.  Midnight, directly following The Laszlo Show, on the Saturday Night Virus, it's the secret  show to the future.  My calculations are correct.  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious shit.  I just want to acknowledge, as we get back on the air live here, that, yes, we all know 
[03:07:30]  that Danny is a dope.  It's Dark Side of the Moon, you ass.  Not the wall.  That means something to somebody out there, that's all.  All right, Mike Birbiglia, Robert Kelly, and Bobby Lee, who's playing, well, Bobby Lee will  be playing Carolines this weekend, 212-757-4100.  And Danny's in the office, actually, he found the Belzer clip.  So I want to see what you guys think about this whole thing.  All right?  And also, I want to give props to Bob Kelly, making US Weekly. 
[03:08:00]  US Weekly, I should say.  Oh, yeah, look at him.  Look at the UFC fight.  Where's Jimmy?  Is Jimmy in that?  You could almost see Jimmy's shirt.  Cropped out.  Jimmy was cropped out of the Mandy Moore photo that we discussed after you guys came back  from Vegas.  It looks like Jimmy's giving me head.  That's the face I have.  You look so into it, Bobby.  Bobby looks so into it.  Can you pass that over, Bobby?  This is when Jimmy and Bob Kelly went out to Vegas for a UFC fight.  Which was a blast. 
[03:08:30]  And they sat right behind Mandy Moore.  Mandy's cheering like crazy, and Bobby's head is right behind Mandy Moore's head, and  it made US Weekly.  I think she's doing one of the fighters, dude.  Did you get that impression?  She was rooting for a couple obscure guys.  I wonder if Forrest Griffin's fucking her.  No.  No.  I think she's banging one of the undercards.  Really?  Yeah.  Because she was really excited about a couple of guys.  But she has the flattest, widest ass I've ever seen. 
[03:09:00]  What?  Not that I was looking at it the whole time around the fucking thing.  I thought I was just staring at her.  Hey, you guys know what robo-tripping's all about?  What?  Big news story today.  Yeah, I know what it is.  The kid's a robo-tripping.  It's a cough syrup.  Well, we were talking about the, you know, the Vicodin with Bobby Lee.  That's what my father used to do when he came back from Vietnam.  He used to drive around.  No offense, Bob.  He used to drive around with a case of cough syrup.  That's what he was addicted to. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, I thought he was selling it.  No, he used to drink.  He used to have a case of cough syrup around.  What's the buzz all about?  You get stoned.  You get fucked up.  I mean, you know, NyQuil and stuff.  Unless you have to drink.  You can get fucked.  I know guys that are addicted to NyQuil.  You can get fucking trashed off that shit.  Oh, yeah.  NyQuil.  Oh, yeah.  Kicks the ass.  You drink a bottle of it?  The whole bottle?  Yeah, there's people that drink that stuff like booze.  Mars has a rumor on Mandy Moore.  Let's bring in Fanboy.  Fanboy!  What's the rumor?  What's the rumor there, Mars? 
[03:10:00]  Mars was a star on the show yesterday.  The rumor is that Mandy Moore is dating Georges St-Pierre.  It's a rumor.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's a rumor.  No.  Yeah.  He's not pure St-Pierre.  He's a stud, man.  He's a fucking her.  Yeah, he's a stud, huh?  Nah.  He's a stud.  He's a stud or she's a stud?  What are you talking about?  Him?  He's a stud, yeah.  You like the way he has that tattoo on his calf?  Do you like that?  Does he have a tattoo?  Yeah, right.  All right.  Get a shit in, Mars.  Fucking nose.  Goodbye, fanboy.  Goodbye.  Loves those UFC guys. 
[03:10:30]  He was a mess yesterday talking to Randy Couture.  I would have been too.  Is Randy a big guy?  Yeah.  He's big?  Yeah.  Pussy.  What?  He's a pussy.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  He's a nice guy.  Why isn't your mic on, Bobby?  You can hear me?  Let me try this.  Now go.  Can you hear me now?  Yeah.  Bobby Lee back with the show.  Can we put the table up?  Yeah.  Let's put the table up.  I like putting the table up.  Let's do it.  It's already too big for Bobby. 
[03:11:00]  The chair's too short over there.  It's ridiculous.  Too tall for Bobby.  Is that what you're talking about?  No, it's just terrible.  I'm leaning down.  Look at me.  I can sit.  Look at it.  Is I fine?  Yeah, you're fine.  You're still a bit lower than the rest of us.  It's okay.  All right.  I'm small.  I don't care.  All right.  I was born this way.  What am I going to do?  I didn't know you could say.  I'm not angry now.  I don't know why.  I didn't know you could say I don't care in that high of a pitch.  It was a really high frequency.  We'll be here, man. 
[03:11:30]  See, he's going to be on Vicodin by the end of the day.  Jesus.  He's going to make a relapse.  Let's get into this robo-tripping.  A bunch of people saying this has been around a while.  Well, the news is hitting on it today because there's a lot of YouTube videos you can check out.  You're watching teens appearing to get high on over-the-counter cold medicines 
[03:12:00]  and then sharing their videos and stories online for the whole world to see.  It's called robo-tripping.  Nice.  Getting high from extremely high doses of cough syrup and medications containing DXM,  dextromethorpham.  DXM can be found in medicines like quercetin or its street name Skittles  and in robo-tussin, where robo-tripping gets its name. 
[03:12:30]  So?  Oh.  She says robo-tussin.  I like the emphasis you put in the second half of the word.  I'm robo-tripping.  Oh, it's robo-tripping.  I'm robo-tripping.  Drink the whole thing and we'll do an experiment.  Drink the whole thing and see if you get high.  Yeah.  I will.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I fucking double-dare you.  This robo-tussin, by the way, also, turns your cock into a noodle.  Yeah.  Noodle cock.  How about if your cock is a noodle to begin with? 
[03:13:00]  Noodle cock.  I'm not even talking about like, it just, you'll get no fucking response from your dick.  So my penis would disappear, then?  Not necessarily size-wise.  If it looked like a noodle before, and then it'll just disappear?  Then it just vanish.  We got it.  Like a baby dick.  It just, uh...  Didn't work when I said it.  I said it.  I actually said it before you.  Rephrase it.  Come back to the table.  Like, it's a horrible, horrible medication they should put on there.  You know, it'll be very difficult to get a boner. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Hasn't, hasn't, haven't people always used over-the-counter drugs as, as street drugs, though?  Yes.  Always.  I think it got worse when the dumb politicians decided to make the drinking age 21.  Mm-hmm.  Thinking, all right, now we're gonna have straight-laced kids all over America.  Yeah.  No, they're gonna find other ways to get fucked up, you idiots.  Yeah, but now it's with YouTube.  It's out there.  Right.  They're making this whole fuck.  These idiots, these morons are putting it on YouTube now.  I'm sure, I'm sure, you know, over the years people were doing the pills and all that,  but it got a lot worse after the drinking age went off. 
[03:14:00]  You can't, you can't do anything fun anymore, because someone puts it on YouTube, and, I  mean, you can't do this, you can't be racist.  And then they take it away.  Here's one of those, you can...  What do I call Skittles on the street, though, now?  You can...  Yeah.  Like, regular, real Skittles.  Extra...  That's what I'm...  You have to say this.  Skittles, the candy.  Ah.  Literal gym.  And then if you wink, they'll think it's the drug.  No, you know what it is?  You can buy it without needing anybody, because it's alcohol.  You can just buy it from a pharmacy.  Mm-hmm.  24 hours a day.  Mm-hmm.  Don't you need a prescription for that? 
[03:14:30]  No.  For Robitussin?  No.  If it has alcohol and all that in it?  No.  I bet you mentioned it.  Any young lad could buy this, chug it down, have a good time.  Go ahead, kids.  Let's get back to this.  Robert Anderson is the director of Daytop, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in  Westchester County.  He says the abuse of over-the-counter drugs among teens is reaching epidemic proportions.  Epidemic.  Kids are getting information that can potentially be lethal and dangerous and probably alter  the course of their future. 
[03:15:00]  Dr. Richard Gallagher is a director at the NYU Child Study Center.  The dangers are that at high levels, kids can cause their whole system to get suppressed.  And there have been a few cases of kids overdosing and dying as a result of it.  You know what I love about the news?  They're saying it's an epidemic and everything.  But after they do this news story, more kids are going to try it.  More kids will do it.  Because they're like, oh, you can do this.  That's great.  They told you what to use.  Such a good idea.  Right. 
[03:15:30]  And Robitussin was stupid.  I'm somewhere RoboTripping got its name.  I didn't really know until now.  And now I want to just try it for the hell of a night.  Now I know.  There's going to be a lot of kids running around going, I'd like to RoboTrip.  They use the voice too.  Yeah.  Crazy.  It doesn't make any sense.  I need something with Dextromethorafan.  And the news knows this.  Yeah.  It makes for good TV watching.  It makes the ratings.  The trade group that represents the leading makers of these over-the-counter medications  say these drugs are safe when taken as directed. 
[03:16:00]  They recently launched an awareness campaign, one that's aimed at parents.  There you go.  Seems to me like a real case of the almighty dollar winning out.  They got us by our purse strings.  We sure do hit them in their pocketbooks.  You know what I heard?  I heard if you stick a pencil in your eye five inches, you die.  Wow.  I heard that.  Yeah.  But it's a real trend.  A lot of these kids are doing that these days.  Intense buzz right before him.  You ever put a paper clip in your cock hole? 
[03:16:30]  Oh, no.  No.  No.  You don't even joke like that.  You open it up straight and you fucking just push it down.  It tears your whole skin.  See how far?  Ow.  And then it hurts when you pee?  I was having this conversation with men and women the other day and I was curious where  you guys weigh in on this.  You know how women always...  You know how I'm leading the show now?  I'm like, okay, no.  Let me open it up to the floor. 
[03:17:00]  No.  You know how women are always like, we have the same sex drive as men and all that kind  of stuff.  And I agree.  I mean, they have sex drive, but in a different way.  Hands raised.  Have you ever masturbated while driving?  I won't raise my hand, but I've done it.  But I didn't do it.  And ask a woman that.  But I didn't do it.  I did it out of necessity.  Necessity.  I was falling asleep at the wheel.  And I woke up scraping along the Jersey barrier. 
[03:17:30]  With your cock?  Yeah, right.  With spark slime.  So I just jerked off and came in my lap.  I haven't jerked off.  I just hold it really tight.  You know what I mean?  So I don't nut, but I just kind of just hold it as tight as I can.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So that the blood goes back into my body.  You know what I mean?  So I don't have an erection anymore.  I did it more for fun because I was in an automatic and I usually drive a shift.  So I just run through the gears. 
[03:18:00]  You needed something to shift.  Yeah.  Downshifting.  It was just fun.  I did it when I ran.  And then I came.  I did it when I ran the go-karts.  Just driving a go-kart.  You know, I twisted the...  No, it's something you do definitely when you're younger.  You don't do it now.  You know what I'm doing?  I'm cruise hookers with fucking my dick in my hand.  Yeah.  And you fuck, yes!  You fucking just put it out.  And you shake it.  You clear stuff like on the belly button area of your shirt because you're sitting.  And you keep putting it back in.  And you piss into your fucking empty, clear Starbucks cup. 
[03:18:30]  That's you know, you're an addict.  I always knew I was going to cruise horse and I would fucking hit the cell and go,  Can I have an empty cup?  Because I would have to piss into it because I pissed so much.  Oh, shit.  Because you'd get nervous?  I would pull over and fucking...  I would keep my car running.  And then I would fucking lean up at my feet against the fucking body gas pedal and just  fucking piss.  I was afraid of getting arrested.  I used to have to jerk off before I performed because I got so nervous, right?  And all that butterfly, you know what I mean?  So I had a nut, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  I heard Bill Maher do that too, but it would kill the... 
[03:19:00]  I wouldn't fucking jerk off before I had to go on stage.  When I was with my band, I would, not for like 24 hours, take all the energy out of  your legs.  Like an athlete.  Yeah.  You want to fucking...  Starve yourself.  You want to fucking be full of piss and vinegar.  Did your girl ever try to blow you and you need to dump ice water down the front of  you, boxers?  Smell of the gym.  Hey, we got a call from Iowa.  This is very rare, so let's take it.  Yeah.  Boar skin.  What's up? 
[03:19:30]  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  I've robo-tripped and that's nothing compared to this plant called Davia denavorum.  Sure.  That's the one that Joe Rogan talks about.  Right, yeah.  It's completely legal and it'll give you one hell of a trip for about 10 minutes straight.  They're going to take that one away from you guys.  You know that, right?  There's a story out of Boston today.  They're really trying to get that out of the kids' hands.  Where do you get this plant? 
[03:20:00]  It's like on frogs and stuff or something.  No.  No, it's a plant.  Oh, that's the one that's a plant?  They're not licking the frogs online?  You can order it online and get it in head shops.  It's completely legal.  You sound like Mike Birbiglia.  You're the same voice.  The voice, you said it.  What is his name?  Do you chew it or smoke it?  You smoke it.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, you can make it into a tea also.  But what's the excuse for getting this?  What about muffins?  Like, they can't say you could get really fucked up from this.  What are they saying?  Put it by your windowsill. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, it's a good herb for your spaghetti sauce.  What are they saying?  It's sold as a relaxer.  Ah.  Hey.  It probably is in small quantities, but, I mean, if you take a massive ripping bong hit,  you're going to start hallucinating and trying to jump out windows like a friend of mine did.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was just told this story just a couple days ago.  A friend of mine, apparently there's different grades of the salvia, and some of it's like a little weaker.  Just like with pot, some of it's all right, and some of it's like killer stuff.  So they apparently had gotten some really good stuff, and they wanted to make a YouTube video. 
[03:21:00]  And so one friend of mine smoked a big bong hit of salvia, while the other one was trying to film it with his MacBook.  But the MacBooks have the built-in camera, so he's holding his laptop in front of the kid.  So he takes the hit, immediately starts hallucinating, starts just throwing wild punches everywhere,  banging his head against the floor, sees my friend holding the laptop, just doesn't want to deal with him,  and just kind of, from below, just kind of palms the laptop, so just went flying and breaks, 
[03:21:30]  and then just bolts into his bedroom, throws the window open, punches the screen out,  and then tries to dive out the window.  My friend, who's now hands-free because his laptop is smashed into pieces,  had to grab his legs to stop him from jumping out of it.  How high was it?  Wow.  I think they were on like a third floor, a second, third floor.  That's great.  I have a fucking great laptop.  There's no one I would stop at the risk of the laptop.  Well, here's a story coming out of Massachusetts.  Every once in a while, we will hear something that we didn't know about,  that kids are using or getting their hands on, that's pretty scary, 
[03:22:00]  and you have one called, what is it, Salvia?  Yep.  A couple years ago, WBZ Joe Shortsleeve did an investigation on it, and today...  How can you take Joe Shortsleeve seriously?  I'm Joe Shortsleeve.  And they say, like, and Walter Cronkite.  Listen, they make it sound like that's a real newsman's name.  WBZ Joe Shortsleeve did an investigation on it today.  He's got a T-shirt, huh?  Timmy Greenpants did a story this week.  I know a little bit about Joe Shortsleeve. 
[03:22:30]  He was the weather guy and decided he needed to do more with his career.  Really?  But they're still keeping the wacky weatherman name.  He's dating Anthony, Aaron.  Yes, yes, that's what I'm doing.  I'm just trying to make my way around all the hunks on the news.  All the departments on the news.  You got me.  Working my way through.  A couple years ago, WBZ Joe Shortsleeve did an investigation on it, and today, the  Globe is reporting that actually the legislature is trying to make this drug illegal. 
[03:23:00]  So on the streets, it's called Magic Mint or Sally D.  But when you hear on the street, it sounds illegal.  This drug looks a lot better.  Magic Mint.  Sally D.  A bunch of kids put their faces in a refrigerator looking for a plant.  I'm sure.  I've also just received word that.  Jimmy just booed himself.  Boo.  It's called the first time when I said it, so we got back door at the same joke place.  Only two.  Pat Duffy might be an expert on the Salvia.  Fucking show is ruthless.  Oh, really?  Pat Duffy might have done this. 
[03:23:30]  Hold on, Pat.  We'll get to you in a sec.  On the street, it makes it sound illegal.  But this drug that looks a lot like pot is not illegal in places like Massachusetts.  You can buy it in some smoke shops.  And that could change according to today's Globe.  Of course.  There's an effort now to ban Salvia Divinorum, the drug that some say could lead to suicide.  Now, most kids smoke it out of a bong or roll it into a joint.  It produces an almost immediate hallucinogenic high.  If you go on YouTube, you'll find dozens of videos posted by YouTube.  That's what these fuckers do. 
[03:24:00]  Here's how you do it.  They're not helping anyone.  They're making more people, you know, know.  You've never heard of this till now.  Right.  Better is...  How you can get high.  Better is the next clip.  I won't spoil the surprise for anybody, but one of the anchors tries to, you know, blame  the internet for the spread of its knowledge.  Let's just put it that way.  And it just, it made me, in the morning, I was just like, what is this?  Are we retards?  Like, what's the anchor's name?  Bill Short Shorts?  Right.  Bill Tube Socks. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  Hopefully fucking, like, Frank Colosti.  You know, he had a surgery recently.  Hank Tank Toppo.  Who's going to give us the news?  It's Ted Catherine.  Johnny Bicycle Shorts.  Immediate hallucinogenic high.  If you go on YouTube, you'll find dozens of videos posted by users.  Oftentimes, they start out laughing, then they start crying.  They just did a commercial for this.  Yeah.  This is great marketing for the drug.  You're right.  Here is the mother of a kid that we profiled.  Joe Short Sleeve did an interview. 
[03:25:00]  Joe Short Sleeve.  Joe Short Sleeve stinks.  He's wearing long sleeves.  Joe Short Sleeve.  He should get fucking Lou Gehrig's disease.  Change your real name, stupid.  He has a hat and a little pad of paper in one of those cameras with a bulb.  He's got...  You think to keep his name going, wherever he goes, he has to have short sleeves?  Short sleeves.  Yeah, you gotta be Joe Short Sleeve.  Because it's the middle of winter.  It's Joe Short Sleeve.  Hey, you wearing short sleeves today? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Shut up.  Too cold for Joe Short Sleeve, huh?  Ah, you know, fellas.  Come on, man.  Yeah.  I fucking hate him.  Steve in Albany writes, Joe Short Sleeve and his co-anchor Tim Wifebeater.  So that's a good anchor team they got in Boston.  Hope Joe Short Sleeve gets cancer of the tongue and they have to take it out like fucking  Eddie Van Halen and you can just lisp your way through a tour that nobody gives a shit  about.  I got it, Jim.  You really did just go on and on.  We profiled Joe Short Sleeve, did an interview about a young man who committed suicide after 
[03:26:00]  repeatedly using salvia, 17-year-old honor student Brett Chidester.  Now, Brett's mom says there's no doubt the drug altered his mind and personality and eventually  led to his death.  So the Globe says the legislature is working on that bill right now.  It's a drug of concern, the DEA says, but in many places, it's like Massachusetts, it's  still legal.  You have to say it's as potent as LSD, but the key words are kids think if it's legal,  then that must mean it's safe.  Right.  And all these kids post these videos on YouTube. 
[03:26:30]  So I went on there thinking that, okay, they're going to glorify it, right?  But it's pretty scary.  Some of them start laughing and then you see them lose their minds.  He's got a microphone.  Yeah, it's pretty scary.  They start laughing.  I'm doing it now.  I'm doing my scary voice.  What's scary about laughing, you idiot?  Hey, what's the, um...  What?  What is this shit, though?  Sally D.  Yeah, but like, what is it?  It's a plan.  It's just a plan.  Somebody just gave Anthony some of it.  I was wondering if you had to buy it in a fucking drugstore like, uh, cough medicine 
[03:27:00]  or something.  Now, are people taking this because they can't get pot or they just want a new high?  This is stuff that you could find in like the back of like High Times magazine, you know?  People, why are they doing it, though?  Because people already go through it.  It's easier than getting pot.  It's legal.  And pot is getting easy.  I can get pot right now.  And you're always looking for a new high.  Yeah, but this isn't like, this isn't just getting stoned.  Like, this is like taking like, yeah, like eight tabs of acid and then washing it down with  some shrooms.  Oh, right, right, right.  Ten minutes.  It doesn't last as long as that stuff.  So this, you could just get in and get out. 
[03:27:30]  But in those ten minutes that you're ridiculously high.  So acid is better.  It's a nine hour high acid.  You know what I mean?  Opie, this is legal, though.  CC the devil.  Why don't you get some and then have one of these guys do it and see what happens?  Well, she probably has some on him now.  Listen, and I want to acknowledge that unlike the news organizations, we are trying to turn  people on to this fine new high you could.  That's exactly what my friend said after he told me the story about how he, you know,  he broke a laptop and went to jump out a window.  He goes, you think, you think the guys want me to do this on the air? 
[03:28:00]  I'm like, no, probably, probably not.  Pat Duffy knows, but let's get to the end of the Joe Shortsleeve clip here.  Terrified, right?  But it's pretty scary.  Some of them start laughing and then you see them lose their minds almost in the course  of a minute or so.  And then they go to sleep.  They take a nap.  And they get real hungry and watch cartoons.  And then they start munching out.  They get a bag of Doritos.  Then they jerk each other off and come in each other's mouth.  Oh, sorry.  No, no, go ahead, Bob.  In the course of a minute or so. 
[03:28:30]  And their friends start out laughing, too.  And then they get very concerned about it.  But this woman of this young man, Brett, who died, she has firsthand experience.  This fucking guy just described a good time.  Right?  Total asshole.  Until the friend died.  Until the friend died.  Yeah.  I think with all this stuff, it's like, it's all about, you try this stuff when you're a  kid and then someone you know dies and then you're like, maybe I shouldn't do that anymore.  You don't have to see it on the news.  Hopefully it's not you.  And you move on.  And let's be honest.  A lot of the kids that die in high school, you weren't going to, like, hang out with them 
[03:29:00]  after high school anyway.  Yeah, but plus, the kids that die, too, they're weak.  There's something in their body that couldn't handle it.  You know, everybody else does it.  We're fine.  Sure.  That person probably.  Some people die just walking.  Denny ran to go pull some good salvia audio, so.  This woman of this young man, Brett, who died, she has firsthand experience with that.  He kept a journal where he wrote as he was taking the drug.  Oh, cool.  It was clearly that his mind was not in the right place.  What's also scary is that if you're going to command this one, there will be something  else.  Dear diary, I want to fuck mom in the ass. 
[03:29:30]  Jesus.  He's the last one.  He's the last one.  Dear diary, my waist hurt.  I'm going to go fly.  I'm sweating right now.  By the way, the news guy there just described Sgt.  Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club.  I mean, it was funny.  Trying to make sense of that fucking album.  Victor fucks salvia.  Huh?  Mindray the bridge in the middle. 
[03:30:00]  All right, here we go.  Mind was not in the right place.  What's also scary is that even if you ban this one, there will be something else that  is legal that will pop up.  Oh, that's a really good point.  I know Kathy Caron did a story on this seed that they sell at nurseries that kids are using  to get high.  There's always something out there, and that's the scary thing.  Why don't you tell us about the seed, because I don't know about the seed, and now I'm going  to do a little Googling after the show.  Help us out.  Yeah, this is what they're doing.  Just a side note here.  Richard Simmons looks like Sam's dad.  I know it's hacked, but he really has cotton candy hair at this point. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, they look exactly like his cotton candy hair.  Where was Richard Simmons?  Where do you see him?  He was just on TV.  No, he wasn't.  Yes, he was.  We watched TV.  Richard Simmons is testifying in front of Congress today about childhood obesity.  Oh, yeah.  He likes him skinny.  Sorry, Robert.  You know what?  They eat a little too much.  Oh, look at that.  It is.  Little Bobby.  I like Patrice.  No, I like that.  Patrice.  Patrice as a child. 
[03:31:00]  They're doing the fat kid montage, by the way.  There he is.  Yeah.  Oh, I miss him.  A sustainable economic...  Oh, wrong one!  Wrong.  Wrong TV.  His hair looks like Carrot Top pubes.  Is he going to start weeping openly there?  He's a little too overweight for that tank top he's for.  He has nice lips, though.  Look at his lips.  Oh, how many cocks have just fucking been buried between those, right? 
[03:31:30]  You can only jerk off thinking.  Oh, I'd rather be throwing a toaster in that fucking pool.  I'd rather have kids wiped out.  Oh, fat white people.  All right.  Must have P.E. every day in every school.  And that's what I will fight for in Capitol Hill.  All right.  And this Capitol Hill isn't the only thing.  I will continue doing this until I see this in the school system.  But when you go to Capitol Hill, now the burning question in my mind, I've got to ask it.  The burning.  Are you going to be wearing the infamous shorts?  Not only am I.  No, I'm not. 
[03:32:00]  Those little boys are, too.  I want to look like a congressman, and I want to talk like a congressman.  I want to respect what I have to say.  That's important.  Because no one has worked any harder in this education than me.  I've given my life up for this.  I'm 60 years old now, and I will not stop until I see kids more active, until I see their scores go up,  until I see them learn more, until their self-esteem and self-respect rises.  Richard, I love the message.  So he can take all that from them in one for us.  I can't wait to see you in a soup ship. 
[03:32:30]  Contessa, I'll wear a suit on Capitol Hill.  Contessa, thank you very much for your time.  You are a darling.  And thank you, MSNBC.  Who's taking this seriously?  Thank you, Richard.  Good luck.  Thank you.  He had that weird patch of hair on his chest, too.  Yeah.  All right, let's get to the end of this clip.  Hi, there's always something out there, and that's the scary thing.  Even when you ban one thing, they'll always get their hands on something else.  And the knowledge of it can spread online much faster.  Joe Shortsleep went into a store on Huntington Avenue, bought an $10 dollar bank.  Boom, Shortsleep.  Oh, wow.  Walk that store is always readily available. 
[03:33:00]  Good to know.  Good to know.  And they're blaming the internet for the spread of knowledge.  Meanwhile, I wouldn't have known about that seed you could buy in a garden shop if it  wasn't for these idiots talking about it on the news.  Like they're not part of the media for some reason.  Deja vu.  That's a little dangerous.  All right.  Did Pat Duffy do this stuff?  Yeah.  Where's the duff?  Actually, I have him pull in some audio of a bad salvia trip.  Get that drug addict in here.  All right, listen.  We're going to go back to Last Comic Standing.  Bobby Lee playing Carolinas this weekend. 
[03:33:30]  212-757-4100.  We played, what's her name?  Esther Koo.  Esther Koo.  If you're just tuning in, Last Comic Standing, they had Esther Koo doing all sorts of stereotypical  Asian humor.  You had the Belzer thing?  Which we love.  All good.  Getting huge laughs.  And then there was a white guy trying to do some Asian humor.  Who went first, right?  He went like two people for her.  Uh, yes.  Yes.  So after Richard Belzer gave this guy a talking to, then the Korean girl does, you know,  stereotypical humor as well, and she got nothing but praise for what she was doing 
[03:34:00]  up there.  Oh, that's nice.  From us, also.  We got a little-  That's my audio.  Yes.  We got a little taste of Zach.  Mike's exactly right.  We actually enjoyed her thoroughly.  We were loving it.  Bobby ended up inadvertently being her biggest advocate.  He's like, this Esther Koo, we're like, yeah, she's fantastic.  Cracking up like it was fucking delirious.  We were just imagining a white girl saying it.  What's this comedian's name?  Heath?  Uh, I gotta see how it's-  Heath Hitch or something like that? 
[03:34:30]  Heath Heich?  Heich.  Yeah, it's Heich.  Heich or something.  I don't know.  Heich?  That's not Heath Heich, is it?  Yeah.  He's famous-  Heath is very funny.  But isn't he huge in Canada?  Yeah, no, he's huge in the South.  In Canada, too, right?  5,000 seats in Canada?  He's like a blue-collar act.  Really?  Yeah, he's a blue-collar comedy guy.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Well, he tried some Asian humor on last time.  I gotta see.  Heath's such a nice guy.  We don't have it up there.  We just have audio on this one.  What?  1941.  Red Leader Tower, Red Leader Tower, we're clear for takeoff. 
[03:35:00]  Go ahead, Red Leader, you are clear.  Is this Police Academy?  No, he's a prop comic.  A prop?  Propeller?  Yeah.  You mean literally a prop comic.  He makes sounds of propellers.  No, he's literally seeing, look, I know this bit.  He sits down, right?  He has the whole thing, and then he plays a kamikaze guy, right?  Yes, that's what's going on. 
[03:35:30]  Puts all the little eyes.  Puts the Asian eyes on the whole outfit.  It's the Asian eyes that messes everyone up.  It's like Asians look at them and go, ours eyes aren't even that squinty, dude.  He literally puts little lines on his eyelids and then just shucks his big, round American  eyes.  What are you saying, man?  What does he do?  He puts his glasses on, dude.  To make himself look Asian.  I don't know how he does it.  I don't know why I'm yelling at you, Robert.  Yeah, he really is.  He should be.  Settle down.  All right.  I'm sorry.  There's sincere racial tension in the room right here.  The setup is, yeah, he's a prop comic, and he also does a lot of voices, obviously. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So I guess we should have told the folks out there.  He sounds like a terrific guy.  Shut up.  I have to breathe.  Tower, we're airborne.  Tower, I'm looking around.  I see no enemy aircraft.  Stand by, Tower.  Something dead ahead. 
[03:36:30]  I'm going to check him out.  Could be hostile aircraft.  Stand by.  He's coming right at me.  I've been hit.  I've been hit.  I can't see him.  I can't shake him.  Do you have a visual?  That's it.  That's it right there.  What is he saying?  He's not saying anything.  He's just being silly.  Me so drunk.  I can't shake him.  He's right on my tail. 
[03:37:00]  I'm going to try the dive maneuver to lose him.  Where did he go?  Pretty accurate.  He's a good pirate.  He's fire like a powerful.  Where did he go? 
[03:37:30]  Holy smokey behind me now.  You can forget me out of here.  The skies are safe once again.  What do you say, Vegas?  I mean.  I hate it when white people do impressions of Asians and they go, holy smoke.  What about I'm wrong?  Yeah, it's hoary smoke.  I don't know that.  That's like short rap from Indiana Jones.  Holy smoke, Dr. Jones.  That is such a stereotype of how airplanes sound. 
[03:38:00]  What?  Well, we get the Richard Belger comment.  I mean, that's what this really is all about.  Whether the material is good or not.  I mean, he was getting big glasses.  And it was a very visual.  Dude, I'm telling you guys.  The guy rocks a room.  That was a visual bit?  No, I know he's a prop comic.  The hack.  No, you're going to watch it.  He figured he could do an airplane noise and had to make a fucking act out of it.  What do you mean?  I mean, but that's.  You got to see it. 
[03:38:30]  I mean, he's a prop comic.  There's no props through audio.  Yeah, but the key is doing the stereotype thing.  And this is what Belzer had to say.  Let's go to our talent scouts.  What do you think, Richard?  Talent scouts.  We met the needs of the audience to a degree, I thought.  But the Japanese thing, that was ethnic humor from the late 40s and early 50s.  And I'm just allergic to ethnic stereotyping in 2008.  Hey, Belzer.  Hey, Belzer.  No shit in your hat.  Allergic.  Is he saying that it's wrong or that it's hack and unpredictable? 
[03:39:00]  So he's allergic to it.  Yeah, that's how I said it.  In 2008, he said.  No.  Yeah, he's saying two different things, though, dude.  He made it sound like.  He's doing a bit about a fighter pilot in World War II.  You know what I mean?  So it's just like he's doing a bit of the 40s.  Right.  Right.  Which he's saying.  But he's also saying that he's trying to get a little applause break by saying, you know,  we're in 2008.  I mean, that type of humor.  Because I'm just a little allergic to that in 2008. 
[03:39:30]  I don't know.  I think a lot of times people criticize people for being inappropriate.  But really what they're saying is, I don't think you're very funny.  But they don't want to say, I don't think you're funny.  No, but the guy was getting laughs, right?  If you're eating it, yeah.  Yeah.  But if you're not eating it, then it's like.  You're right, though.  But if you put a baboon on stage with little white tap shoes.  Yeah, that gets laughs.  And to play Tura Lura Lura and it danced around, people would laugh and clap.  I would laugh my ass off.  What are you saying about Asian people?  Especially with the Tura Lura. 
[03:40:00]  It's singing an Irish jig.  Tura Lura Lura.  Tura Lura Lura.  Dancing monkey.  Coco's going to open her asshole and fart Merzidotes and Dozidotes.  I threw that red mandrel ass.  We should get Belser on the phone and see what that was all about.  I would love to have him in.  I always have.  See what he meant.  So did Heath get kicked off the show now?  I don't know.  Is it still on?  What did the other town scout say?  I don't even know if the show's on.  I tried to watch The Last Comic Standing.  Can we call Belser? 
[03:40:30]  Has he called?  Does anyone have his number?  Maybe not today, but yeah.  When you're not here.  Well, being an Asian guy, I've never been offended by that Heath Hikes bit.  I've seen him a hundred times.  Being a comic, you should be.  So what do you, what do you, what does Belser say in there?  You do the same impression.  It's just a girl going down on your dick with her teeth.  What do you mean?  Brrrr.  Brrrr.  Brrrr.  Brrrr.  Brrrr.  Brrrr.  Brrrr.  I used to do that.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, but that was insane.  Brrrr. 
[03:41:00]  That was years ago.  What do you think Belser's saying, though?  You're trashing this guy for actually doing the airplane.  Yeah, TV.  I did it in the fucking, in Rascals.  You little rascal.  Brrrr.  Brrrr.  Everybody got the wood chipper.  Brrrr.  I'm in a comedy club called Scamps.  All right, screw what Belser's saying, I guess.  No, I want to know.  I think it's silly.  It's like, why would he say that?  It doesn't make sense.  He used to do racial shit.  Yeah.  He used to do racial shit.  In the 40s.  It is in the 40s.  In the 40s.  But you're right.  Esther Koo is just as bad. 
[03:41:30]  You know what I mean?  She's worse.  She's ripping on her own people.  You just said you're right to no one who said that.  You're like, you're right.  I didn't know how to segue into the thing, man.  You're a bastard.  I know.  I came in, didn't give you a hug, and then you've been attacking me ever since I've been  here.  Oh, right.  I don't mean to be.  You're right.  Oil is too high per barrel.  I tried to stick up for you, Bonnie.  Didn't know how to.  Love that.  You're right.  All right.  Howard Johnson's right. 
[03:42:00]  Did you just fart and smell it?  Yeah.  What am I supposed to do?  Oh, and there's Richard Simmons on the hill.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Obesity.  How did he get in his suit so fast?  One was pretty tense.  We're out of shape.  200 pounds, 400 pounds, 800 pounds.  All right.  We've got to get it.  And I've dedicated all these years to giving them some support and some self-esteem.  What's that about you?  Five years ago, my mail shifted dramatically.  I get thousands of emails a day.  Oh, God.  That's what you do.  That's what you do.  Everybody listens from parents and children saying, my kid is overweight. 
[03:42:30]  My kid is going to the doctors.  Stop feeding them, you fucking idiots.  So what I did was I went on shows like the Today Show, Ellen, David Letterman, Howard Stern,  and I put a four-page questionnaire on richardsimmons.com.  We've got the fag coming on again, Robert.  The frizzy-headed fag is coming on.  He's going to teach how to lose weight by sucking cock. 
[03:43:00]  To me, Congressman Wofford, Congressman Pine, I told him my ideas.  I began another campaign on my website asking people to write their congressmen and presidential candidates  in order to let everyone know how important this is.  Legalize pink socking.  And here I stand with the vision to lower the age of consent of three.  Everyone is not.  Everyone cannot play sports.  The candidates are sitting there reading all that email, too, I'm sure. 
[03:43:30]  Iraq or chubby kids.  What do I do?  It's not important if you're a jock.  It's important that you have your health.  And our children right now do not have it.  What?  I have a vision.  He wanted an applause.  He does.  He wanted an applause.  It's a man's portion.  Plato's retreat.  He's eating it.  He's going to lose the room if he starts doing Asian humor.  I don't know.  I'm wearing the short shorts, but obviously today he is in a suit and talking about a serious issue. 
[03:44:00]  Later on, though, we're told that he will switch into that famous workout wear for a rally and some exercise.  Oh, shut up with the fucking same shorts joke.  We get it.  You know what those things must smell like?  Yeah, come.  Man, come.  Blood.  Blood.  This shit.  And man ass.  You guys want to hear some Silva?  What is it called?  Salvia?  Yeah, Salvia.  We got Salvia audio.  Salvia.  Salvia.  Salvia.  Bro!  This is a video I was watching before because a lot of people, when you start talking about it, 
[03:44:30]  they bring up this guy who does a series.  It's like whatever he's doing on Salvia.  So he's got gardening on Salvia, this on Salvia.  But he's just basically, you know, smoking and like laying down pretty much.  This is really what it's like.  I haven't done it personally, but from what everybody's telling me, this is probably more accurate.  This is real?  Yes.  This is not fake and shit?  No, no way.  All right, good.  Let's play this.  My heart's going fast.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Seems to be having a nice time.  So far, so good.  It's going to turn very quickly.  So far, so good, though.  What's the big deal with this?  I better hear a shotgun go off soon.  It sounds like me and Jimmy at the UFC fights. 
[03:45:30]  Does anyone have this guy's number?  Homer Simpson.  It's me and Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's it, man.  That's amazing.  It's fucking Homer.  It went from him, he was laughing at the beginning of the clip.  I mean, and those screams, like, those weren't with a smile on his face.  Like, he, he, within, within that clip, he went from, like, being just high and having 
[03:46:00]  a fun time with his friends to being completely terrified.  So, it was his friends were laughing at him.  Let me try this again.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Why would you want to do that? 
[03:46:30]  Wow, that's fucking perfect.  Why would you want to do that?  Holy shit.  That is fucking funny, man.  Oh, the radio gods are with me today.  If I did that, Doug, would that be a relapse?  That's synced up perfectly.  Oh, fuck.  I missed it.  I missed it.  All right.  After about a minute of being quiet, he tries to stand and starts screaming again.  So, let's hear this. 
[03:47:00]  Ah!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sold.  Hey, you guys.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!

[03:48:00]  Well, you know what's weird about the YouTube clip?  That's better  Stupid  What were you going to say Mike?  The YouTube clip actually is  Dan Castellano getting high on  Yeah  Whatever it is  Alright  Sally May
