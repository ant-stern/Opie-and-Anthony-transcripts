<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the *Lost* finale, with Opie, Anthony, Jimmy, and Travis offering their varied and often contradictory interpretations of the ending, including heated debates about the meaning of the "flash sideways" and whether the characters perished in the plane crash.  Numerous callers weighed in with their own theories, contributing to a chaotic and profane exchange of opinions regarding the island, the characters' fates, and the show's symbolism.

The conversation then shifted to Bret Michaels's unexpected win on *Celebrity Apprentice*, following his brain hemorrhage.  The hosts played clips from the show, commenting on Michaels' condition and Donald Trump's reactions. This transitioned into a brief discussion about *Celebrity Apprentice*'s declining ratings and a critique of the final seasons of *24*, punctuated by the hosts' expressed desire to go drinking with Kiefer Sutherland.  A tangent followed involving Opie's birthday cheese and sugar binge, alongside a caller’s criticism of the *Lost* discussion.

The show next moved to sports, covering the Flyers' playoff success against the Canadiens, and a debate on the "peaking at the right time" sports cliché.  LeBron James' potential move to the Chicago Bulls and the hosts' affection for the New York Knicks, especially Patrick Ewing, were also touched upon.  A caller, "Don't Watch TV," phoned in, adding to the discussion about Bret Michaels and *Celebrity Apprentice*, providing a humorous, awkward moment.

The show then unexpectedly featured Dana White, president of the UFC.  The discussion began with a caller prompting further talk about Bret Michaels and *Celebrity Apprentice* before pivoting to Dana White's promotional activities and a new UFC video game.  Dana White himself joined the show, sharing humorous anecdotes about his experiences playing the game, including a particularly challenging horseback fistfight that he compared to a frustrating dream.  He also engaged in a detailed comparison of console controllers versus mouse and keyboard controls.

Finally, Dana White described a visit to a shooting range, focusing on the extreme loudness of a .50 caliber handgun and the potential dangers of stray shell casings.  The segment concluded with an audio clip illustrating the handgun's deafening sound.  The show ended with further, scattered discussion of *Lost*, *Celebrity Apprentice*, and the hosts’ opinions on various television programs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  and good morning good morning i bet you were talking to a lot of sleepy heads this morning  oh yes a lot of people that stayed up late to watch lost yeah it was uh the big finale the  series finale not the season finale oh no it's over johnny there's gonna be no movie right  no no movie and um a lot of people know i've i i i never even saw one episode of lost so i'm gonna 
[00:00:30]  just sit back and relax for the next hour as you guys discuss this there wasn't a uh a sopranos  ending either right no it wasn't as uh it wasn't uh vague like the sopranos ending i mean if you  if you just think about what happened the ending snow globe it's uh yeah was it a snow globe it was  an autistic kid holding a snow globe and the whole thing was just like a uh a dream or something  and then bob newhart woke up and uh he was oh that's what happened laying in bed next to his wife from 
[00:01:00]  another show oh okay yeah we can move on with other things it was great how about those mets mets looked  good over the weekend uh yeah did they over your yankees yeah a rod with another swing and a miss  to end the whole fucking game is he slumping runners on bait well is your a rod slumping it  all the yankees are kind of slumping i mean they're losing games a lot of games yeah more than they were  losing at the beginning of the season that's for shit sure and against the mets stop it uh-oh stop it 
[00:01:30]  fire everyone you're far so uh lost why don't you guys get into this because i i've been listening to  you guys talk about this morning and i just told you it's like it's like you guys are part of some  weird cult and i and i'm trying to get info on it and i just can't because you guys are too damn good  talking in vagary you can't explain the final episode and the finale to people that haven't  watched the show right because then it just does sound like very vague and very odd kind of a thing 
[00:02:00]  you can't really it's not like a reality show where you can go oh he picked this bitch to you  know be with yeah uh well i could kind of host this uh i mean jimmy a big fan you're a big fan  travis is a big fan were you guys happy with the uh the series finale a lot of people uh that was  their number one question asking uh did i i think it was a good ending did i and uh yes yes i liked it  i thought it was uh good ending um a lot of people like things really wrapped up tidy um because we 
[00:02:30]  have lives to live well don't don't leave it uh to us to figure out you know wrap it up nice so i  could go to work on monday it uh it was wrapped up it really was wrapped up there yeah but it it does  make you i'm not i don't want to watch it and then step away and go all right well that's over  like you you sit here and if if you're talking with somebody that had watched it you really 
[00:03:00]  are kind of hashing things out trying to think what the fuck was that and and uh you know like this  this ending was kind of um you you still left with what the fuck was the island what was it  christian said this is the place you all made together so you can find one another you're not  leaving you're moving on this is the place you all made together yeah but but is it what what the  fantasy sideways uh uh flash sideways is is that the life they had made that to get them all together 
[00:03:30]  because that's where they figured out who each other was or is the island a place that was made  to get them all together were they really on an island what what of the dharma initiative was that a  real thing was that what now travis is shaking his head yes i think how do you know i think they  were all dead the entire time i firmly believe that you're so wrong how am i wrong oh my god christian  said he said you were on that island everything you did happened okay everything they did happen 
[00:04:00]  when he when he says that this is the place that you guys created for yourselves he's talking about  that like you know purgatory limbo flash sideways okay that's where they were to atone for you know  whatever they did to so what were they all dead from then if they all needed they all died at you  know different times they didn't necessarily die at the same time who knows how long hurley and ben 
[00:04:30]  stayed on that island yeah that's true he said you know you were good number one you were good number  two like like uh ben and hurley were on the island for a while and we don't we don't know how long  they finally dropped dead at some point like they didn't all die at the same time and now they're all  moving on together right so some of them had to kind of you know hang out uh saeed died when saeed died  right when did kate die we don't know could have been years later of old age um so wait so you think 
[00:05:00]  that they just hurley just died or kate just died at some point from something and yet moved on when  they all did yes to me that makes no sense it's uh almost like uh jack waiting at the titanic steps  for the old broad to come back uh it's one of those things where it's it's weird time thing it's not  like you waited they weren't sitting there in the little church thing tapping their foot looking at  their little fucking celestial watches going where the fuck is that person it's like it's kind of this 
[00:05:30]  weird celestial body thing where there's no real time and space but when they all were dead that's when  they were all able to get together and move on as they say into the heavenly light i think they were  very uh quick to point out when christian was talking he said everything that's ever happened to you  is real i think that they were very so they didn't want to cop out yeah they they wanted to make it 
[00:06:00]  completely obvious that that this actually happened see i thought when he said that that it was it's  something that that happened to them in that split second that they were dying like it's it's almost  like all the flash forward and the flash sideways it was trying to find a way in that that that moment  to fix what needed to be fixed and then when they all had fixed what needed to be fixed as many of  them that could move on did ben wasn't ready to move on michael wasn't ready to move on 
[00:06:30]  that's how i took it yeah you're right and like but i don't i didn't believe that they just left  it up to fail like yo kate must have died at one point she was there so you said we all die at  some time you're saying but he said he said people died before you and people uh died after you he told  uh jack that like like i think it wasn't in that split second i don't think they all died in the plane  crash i don't think it was like that nanosecond kind of a thing oh i think they died in the crash and 
[00:07:00]  that's why the end of it was just him in the exact same place that the series opened that was where  his body wound up he fucking got thrown out of the plane he died in the weeds that was exactly where  the series opened was him laying in in in those weeds with his eyes his eyes opened to start the series  in those weeds and his eyes closed in the exact same spot how did that happen and why why did they  close on the plane crash they close on the wreckage nothing built no sign of civilization just a 
[00:07:30]  fucking burned out husk of a plane pretty good to me that is exactly why they had jack die there but  why didn't they all die at the same time if it was a plane crash what's that why did they all die at  the same time if it was a plane crash i think they did and they did i think you're saying they did  sure but and are you saying that no i don't believe they ever survived that crash but maybe they're  dying within milliseconds of each other maybe it's a time thing maybe that's just it like to us 
[00:08:00]  everyone dies in a plane crash at the exact same time but technically it's yeah so there could be  before and after and i don't know why by the way like there's certainly loss experts might be able  to explain dharma and all these other things like maybe albert was it maybe the island is a place that  uh you go to before you move on like a fucking call a purgatory court what you want and maybe  albert was there because he wasn't able to move on he may not have been obviously in the plane crash  and other people that they met there may not have been in the plane crash and there's parts of it i 
[00:08:30]  don't get but there were other people that were kind of just there in limbo kind of right and they  were they were somehow but to me it was like watching flash sideways fast forward the flashbacks  were telling you who these people were right yeah and in a lot of ways how they wound up what their  lives were but the others to me the fucking flash forward the flash sideways were them punching  away out of a bag immediately like do this doing all of these things to try to to fix what was what  was wrong before they could move on then they were able to let go either by getting what they thought 
[00:09:00]  they wanted or whatever it was you know again that i'm not able to explain i otherwise you think that  they all died immediately i don't understand what why else to me and i always thought that because i  couldn't and it confirmed it for me at the end when they had him lay in the exact same spot the  series opened his body got thrown that's where he died so you're thinking that happened like i  completely disagree why what then what what i don't understand he got he was stabbed by the man in  black and he fell and he died there that could and that was a that was a full circle moment that the 
[00:09:30]  series opens with him opening his eyes and the series closes but why in the exact same spot that's  just that's just how it happened that's just that's a that's a story that comes full circle and  what if that stab wound was just a piece of wreckage of course that went into him and that  killed him or the wound didn't matter maybe the wound didn't matter the the him late because he  was wearing a suit in the opening and he was wearing a different thing to it didn't matter yeah  it's because two separate things happened um i don't think they would have had him die in that 
[00:10:00]  exactly i think you're reading way too much into it actually not really they all just died in a  plane crash i can't figure out if they did or not to tell you the truth i don't know like jimmy  is making sense with his point on it but i also think like some of them uh went on to kind of live  life and and he saw jack saw the ajira 316 plane flying away kate and you know uh kate and sawyer 
[00:10:30]  and claire they all left they all left the island he saw them flying away that was the last scene  and i think they all went on and they lived their lives and then when they all died then they all  left together but why would they all leave together doesn't make any sense a bunch of people survive a  plane crash um on some weird island and then they escape off on a plane it doesn't make any sense to  me but it's a mystery show i know but i mean i understand that but in the context of a mystery show 
[00:11:00]  yeah i don't know i don't get that at all i don't know there's things that we are supposed to be  debating you know right now yeah i don't i don't understand i don't think that i saw the plane leave  and all that but i i don't think that uh i don't think they would have had him die in the exact same  spot i thought there were going to be answers there were a lot but maybe you guys will find out more  next week oh that's right it's over no i'll i'll watch it uh again maybe maybe pick up on some stuff 
[00:11:30]  uh just to yeah kind of get get the whole gist or to see if i could pick up on something  i'm so glad i never watched this the battle of good and evil it was like which which way do they go  how do they all these temptations and working out this final thing before they move on that's all  this mania black and smoke monster it was all this very this very basic good and evil kind of thing  did you guys learn what the smoke monster was at least yeah they oh yeah yeah they explained all that  um but hmm yeah there is a basic good and evil thing and that's why like ben uh couldn't go on 
[00:12:00]  he still had some evilness to deal with yeah uh the other people that had done bad things kind of  atoned for their their shit well worked it out and came to peace with themselves good people or yeah  yeah uh hmm kate and claire kate had they all had things that they had to come to peace with  so to me they all came to peace with that and then moved on together but it all happened that 
[00:12:30]  fucking it was it was like somebody walked in and shot us all in this room we would all be dead  instantly but in that however you want to break down a second before we died  we'd look at some fat producer with a gun yes in a white polar bear outfit  well if you guys want phone calls oh yeah i'm very interested to hear yes yes they're lit  all right let's go with uh coke logic why not let's go with the coke man uh coke logic what's up buddy 
[00:13:00]  good evening hello i loved uh lost last night yeah me too thanks episode yeah i will say uh jimmy  totally wrong they didn't die in the plane crash in the original plane crash no no the the whole  sideways thing is like uh everything went in a straight timeline like there was no split at the uh  the jughead that was whatever happened happened they caused the same thing that uh you know crashed 
[00:13:30]  their plane which was making the swan hatch and all so everything was linear uh then eventually  you know people died before jack and people died after jack and that was kind of the uh um you know  once the spirits all were dead you know time is kind of like it's relative so it was all in a moment  so their spirits whatever that fucking energy is out there well wanted to reconnect so they  created this uh alternate timeline where they could uh be awakened you know the when they had deja vu 
[00:14:00]  moments it would uh jog their memory and they remembered their old lives and then they uh moved on  from there that i mean it was kind of like the alternate reality was a meeting place it was like a lobby  on an xbox live chat thing or something you know yeah yeah i i understand that why were they having  lives then in this alternate place meaning like they have this linear thing and then the flash  sideways they have this whole other thing why does jack have a son there because uh in this timeline 
[00:14:30]  there was no island there was no jacob uh jacob never brought richard to the island there's a whole  chain of events that never happened so with the butterfly effect different things happened right  jack had a son because he didn't fucking pull out one time right and he had married juliet  yeah and and that's that you actually had a different last name in this timeline they can't  like they have a intro introduce a husband character that we don't even see it's kind of gay  who did juliet juliet it was uh so juliet berks it was juliet carlson or something it's like 
[00:15:00]  why fucking have her remarried i had nothing doing nothing but  yeah i fucking i fucking loved it fucking enjoyed it i thought i don't i don't necessarily agree with  you but i thought it was uh i did think it was very good it was much better than i thought it was  going to be either way whatever happened with whether i'm right or wrong i still loved it it  was i'm really surprised at how positive the reviews are like online like immediately i thought  everyone was really gonna have a problem with it because in the two and a half hours there weren't 
[00:15:30]  a ton of like real huge you know answers and i know that everybody just wanted answer answer answer  answer i think they were limited to a certain degree by the amount of actors they could get there  was certain problems they had like the michael walt problem because walt which i thought they made a  mistake they should put michael in the church at the end with some little black kid that looked  like they could have a lot of people were saying that since it was heaven there were no black people  i said that to my girlfriend right after she said to me who do you think has the biggest cock on lost 
[00:16:00]  because she did say that because a lot of people noticed that uh the black characters uh were not  there in the church yeah i i really i really thought they should have had michael there was it well michael  was an evil fuck that did some bad things and and maybe he had to spend some more time  and lucia they said hurley said she's not ready yet you know ana lucia wasn't there yeah she did  some nasty shit too again i still don't think that that meant that that whole life happened i find it  much easier to pout to to take that it was that fast i much easier for me i don't know i really just 
[00:16:30]  don't fucking know because uh i think i was gonna say let's go to brad it's so hard to like wrap your  mind around yeah let's go to brad in atlanta brad hey boys hey brad i thought it was an awesome  episode but i was just wondering i know you guys have all been on set before anthony did you notice  the camera tripod cases everywhere no where were they oh they were on the dock when the when the sub  blew up there was one floating i mean i don't know it was laziness or just the camera department being 
[00:17:00]  like yeah us too i didn't notice honestly i didn't notice that there's a tripod theory  right what's up yeah do tripods float by the way this is this is why the newspapers are just shit  like the post talks about it the daily news i guess they're wrapped up shop early and has nothing  what what uh unless i'm missing something no i went through the whole thing nothing i'm lost  and they'll have something tomorrow it's like you dummies they had to go to bed early 
[00:17:30]  they were sleepy heads very like that's the earliest edition i know that but maybe that's  why there is there is a daily news there's a review on online that i've already exactly online  fucking all of this you'll be online only old people buy newspapers it really is what  travis is trying to tell you uh what where do you guys want to go with it i'll just just call  all right let's go to diane in connecticut diane hey guys how's it going i loved the episode last  night um i viewed the plane crash as more like a symbolic like these people had already died and 
[00:18:00]  the plane crash was kind of what took them to purgatory or whatever and then the island was them  having to redeem themselves i don't think they knew each other before they got to the island i think  they were just a random bunch of people that had all died and when the plane was filled up it dropped  them off and that was their their redemption they had to prove themselves and i think the flash  sideways were kind of like okay now that you know these people if you had known them before this is  what your life would have been like yeah um somebody here is saying uh uh when the alternate 
[00:18:30]  timeline was made when jacob touched everybody when they were like you know throughout their lives  jacob like kind of but that doesn't quite know what was that then what was that when when jacob  started like like he saw kate when she was a kid he was marking his candidates well i think  that he was he was a symbolic god and it was showing how he was trying to show them like  listen you know be good now because then you won't be stuck in purgatory he was also keeping 
[00:19:00]  them from being killed by touching them because none of them none of them died but i i really think  that the flash sideways was their way of like i i think resolving in that moment of death what they  thought they wanted in a way getting what they thought they wanted and it kind of they wound up i believe  in the same place you're completely i think you're completely right in that respect i disagree with  you with the the plane crashing but yeah the flash sideways is something that they created to 
[00:19:30]  you know get what they thought they wanted hurley wanted to be positive and do all this stuff  um i'm trying to go through the other ones what this one wanted what that one wanted they all i  guess in a way got what they wanted but still kind of wound up  um in the same place and the flash sideways kind of showed like the best of their characters  like it was life when they were the best person they were right right yeah like the the god or  whatever he was jacob showing him like this is how good you can be like just be this person in the 
[00:20:00]  flash sideways and you're gonna move on so it was i i saw it as like the flash sideways was like  the best part of them i'm trying to think no because saeed was still shitty in the flash sideways  but he thought he wanted naughty to be safe he wanted naughty to be safe and she was safe but by  being safe he couldn't have her right but he was still shitty forwards they were kind of all like  they're the worst you know what i mean like jack was like hooked on drugs and like so the flash  forwards were very different where they were the worst people and then the flash sideways they were 
[00:20:30]  the best people that's just the way i thought all right maybe that's the interpretation of it but it's uh  i still think it happened in a very short period of time yeah i think it was like instantly like  they died they went to wherever they went to they redeemed themselves and then they moved those who  moved on moved on and the plane crash by the way i really think was just what killed them i disagree  with you there i think the plane crash killed them yeah i don't know whatever it was it was just  the fact that it closed on him in the exact spot that the series opened and on the wreckage with 
[00:21:00]  nothing there there was no sign that they had ever been there except the wrecked plane on the beach  to me those two images were too it were too definite a message to be just part of this of  what is a circular or at least a full circle that those two images kind of i always felt that way  but when i saw that and they closed on the wreckage i'm like it doesn't make sense for them to close  on those exact images if that's not what it was i agree totally i agree then what about the people 
[00:21:30]  thank you all right all right what about the people that weren't on the plane that were there  like what about you know dharma people and stuff yeah yeah i don't know exactly people that came on  the boat people that came at you like like where were they the way i interpreted the interpreted exactly  black prison scholars we were all interpreted it was a long night uh the the absolute final scenes 
[00:22:00]  with just the plane crashed the wreckage yeah i just saw that as them showing just a scene from  what happened in the beginning of the series i didn't view that the same way that you did as the  ending of yeah i just saw that as like you know this wreckage is still here on this island because it  is it's it's still yeah sitting there i looked at it like this is all it ever was this plane just  fucking crash and this is all it ever was everyone died plane and this is he's this is where this dumb 
[00:22:30]  doctor died right in the fucking weeds he his his eyes never opened yeah ever no let me uh say how  to rich in buffalo rich hello hello rich stubborn jimmy wrong wrong wrong maybe deal i'm not being  rich i'm not being stubborn that's just how i saw it yeah no no well here's the deal um at the very end  where the father christian shepherd explains to him that that time period was the most important 
[00:23:00]  time of their lives they needed each other and and all that go back and watch that yeah that that could  have been a split second also the most important time because it's when they were dying no coke logic  said it right he basically said that um this was like a place that they all made together so that they  can meet up later because i think anthony you just said that um why were there people who were not on  the plane there yeah some people die before you some people die after you but it time means nothing 
[00:23:30]  there so yeah ultimately they all met up you know in this place before moving on but the people that  died that weren't on the plane crash could have gotten there from other other means so to me it when  you move on you you encounter other people who are dying at the same time or also dying and trying  to move on it's almost like you all get thrown into a waiting room together whether it's now i don't  know if the island was something they know each other then what's that then how would they know each  other then what what do you mean how would they know each other because penny knew all the other 
[00:24:00]  people and whatnot and again well maybe maybe a lot of that happens in in that split second i don't know  exactly how they would know each other i don't know but you're not explaining it any better to me  if they died in the plane crash why when they're in the church then is everyone so happy to see all  of these people that because they all died on the plane crash they have no memories of each other because  i think that they i think that all of their relationship or their memories happens in that 
[00:24:30]  moment of dying together and i think that they've all been they're all these people who went through  this thing in in again what was a split second for us but for them it is very linear and did happen  you did have all these these moments and these know each other in that split second in a human  in a human split second but in a spiritual split second all of that shit could have happened yeah  everything from the plane crash to the the very ending could have happened in a human split second but 
[00:25:00]  could have been this big long epic which it was six year series that uh uh spiritually can  seem like it took years yeah  nah you guys think  nah but you didn't explain it any better sir he just goes  nah  you can't  i didn't i didn't agree with the explanation i heard it and he did make sense i just i'd  not the way i saw it none of these aren't making sense by the way  what's that the flesh sideways wasn't sideways at all it's just that them living in that that 
[00:25:30]  kind of uh pre-awakening uh almost a heaven where they everything they wanted was kind of  happening for them you know yeah we but then they all just died together  they ultimately uh when they were all ready  to move on  they  had this place where they could be awakened and desmond was the key to that  but 
[00:26:00]  so none of them had any family  none of them had any family other than jack and his dad  none of them had  anybody that they wanted to see there except for the  the one person they had been with coincidentally all this time  that was the most important  time and people in their lives so  well to me when you're fighting to move on spiritually that's a fucking big that's a  pretty important time  well if you go down the list of characters yeah kate  didn't have anyone no  sawyer didn't have anyone  her only have his mother  well  i just didn't make sense to me i think i still think they all died together i've heard no 
[00:26:30]  explanation and coke baits in good sense  no explanation that says that they did not all die together  in that moment  i was really mad at walt  there was no issue there was no resolution of walt or anything  that was poorly done because again sometimes you have to get somebody  if they had to get a just a young black actor who kind of resembled them  at least it would have wrapped up the story for us even if we knew it was a different actor  they would at least we would have known okay that's what happened to walt and his father 
[00:27:00]  that was kind of annoying that they didn't let those two move on  it was like come on  it's like you can't get  especially in that spiritual vibe there you can't just get a small  kid like that  that was kind of dumb  all right jimmy uh you're being asked here then why was penny  in the church there she wasn't on the plane or anything  um i don't know  like if if that  happened and they all died in the plane crash and stuff why the fuck was penny there  desmond wasn't on the plane either  penny yeah yeah desmond wasn't on the plane either  were they really not on the plane though because desmond said i was sitting next to you on the plane 
[00:27:30]  i was sitting next to you on the plane  he said to me i i said i said they showed him talking to jack on the plane  there might have been a thing where they really were all on that plane and they took on these different roles  when they hit  again i don't know  i'm not saying i can explain it all but  to me it's not that crazy that they were all on the plane because  to be this like completely like well it doesn't make logical sense logically they didn't show  mr echo at the end they did there's a lot of things they didn't tie up either 
[00:28:00]  which i think they could have done a better job of they had gotten actors  it it's one of those things you're just gonna like no one's wrong i mean it's  well somebody the writers had a vision they got like you know who would be able to tell you is the  two creators yeah i guess or jj they would say no jim you're wrong they really did do this  we're traveling they would be able to say this is what our intention was at least  but obviously they didn't want that conveyed because they wanted people to kind of just  mull it over and have these discussions and i love it like to jim it's completely obvious and to me 
[00:28:30]  it's completely obvious yeah exactly so you get the two people with uh different ideas but i'm not  so married to it though that i know for 100 fact i'm right i just haven't heard any i've heard good  explanations but none that have made me go oh my god yeah like you know again the creators explain  that they might be able to say that one thing that makes you go oh fuck maybe other people you  don't look other people seem to have uh um okay i i thought it was great though i'm reading 
[00:29:00]  other people's stuff that just you know it's it sounds just as good and just as reasonable uh  but um i don't know all right uh you got someone that agrees with jimmy jim is wrong for a few  different reasons let me hear that guy lost is the gayest show on tv let's say hi to joe  joe in pennsylvania joe hey boys good morning hi joe hey jimmy uh i i mostly agree i think coke  logic is 100 right and i kind of thought that before i heard his explanation but um and if you 
[00:29:30]  can tell me according to your theory what's going on at the end then when jack sees that ajira flight  take off like how can you explain that underneath your theory because i i my the way i look at it is  he's still in that in that moment like he is still living like you know he just got stabbed by  a guy who looked like john locke he is still in that moment he doesn't leave that moment until his  eyes uh close to me you know what i mean he's still in that hole anything that happens there 
[00:30:00]  is still in that split second i don't know exactly how to explain that flight leaving but to me that  explains it a lot easier then yeah yeah they took off landed had a good life met up eventually and then  to me that makes a lot more sense the way i'm looking at it yeah you know what that whole  plane taking off thing was a little too far-fetched for them to for it to be literal like i don't see  that plane turning around in the sand after sitting on a beach and this guy just starts it up and takes 
[00:30:30]  this fucking pretty much wrecked plane off i don't see it as literally they left on the fucking plane  no i didn't either it's some kind of figurative symbolic thing that that happened but i can't  fucking wrap my mind around it yet no i guess after a few more viewings maybe i don't think that  they literally left on that plane either yeah see i do you do yeah i do sorry your show  one of the questions you guys had was like well when did keith die when did sawyer die 
[00:31:00]  i kind of thought they probably crashed probably 10 seconds after jack saw that plane because it's  so ridiculous to think that that thing was worthy of flying but do you see what i mean like when  they die they probably crashed into the ocean right after jack you're you're adding a whole new plane  crash like how is what i'm saying so crazy that you're adding a plane crash like to be linear if  you're going to be linear there's a whole lot more to swallow then this is what happens when you die 
[00:31:30]  you have it's almost like your whole life flashes before your eyes uh they say that you see your  whole life in a split second well again in that same time frame where you're not really seeing your  you know you can't see every moment of your life in a second but it probably feels like you can  that's what this is but i i don't believe that this dopey lapidus i don't believe that miles was able  to fix a fucking aircraft with duct tape and then they were able to take off you never saw that  myth busters episode as the island was cracking and then the plane takes off out of dirt it backs 
[00:32:00]  up out of palm trees and takes off out of dirt and then they just die somewhere down the road of  fucking cancer and a fucking prostate swelling and then all of a sudden these guys are all meeting  them in a church or they happen to be people because some who knew each other some who didn't who  were thrown together in a moment of death and their bond became they helped each other get beyond  this most important thing which was the transition from life into death now the people that were on  the island already um uh what if they were experiencing some death experience uh somewhere else like but 
[00:32:30]  they're all brought together in this place to kind of make a restitution and possible maybe the island  is again maybe the island itself isn't where the plane crashed maybe the island is the place  that they see in that moment of right right maybe that's where they all go they're all thrown on this  island and go all right you did okay while you were alive um you did okay but you have a lot of baggage 
[00:33:00]  with you and here is where you fix that before you fucking go on to the next level and and that  would kind of explain what all this coincidental meeting that they all had right because that never  really that that kind of was just the things being resolved in their head as they were  there together on this fucking island maybe the flashbacks were very literal the flashbacks may  have been actual just things to let us know what these people were like what their lives were like  that's what i kind of see but uh as far as the sideways is go i uh i also think the flash forward 
[00:33:30]  and the flash sideways were things that were just happening um again they're trying to just punch  the way out of this fucking bag they're trying to find the right way to get resolution and then go  looks like there's more questions than answers guys well that's for sure who's the person that  agrees with me there's been none so far uh well misty but i want to go on to chris has this uh 
[00:34:00]  jacob's ladder theory okay chris and uh what's up chris morning um i was kind of disappointed  because my first thought was this is purgatory when they crashed yes and that's kind of how the  whole movie played out was if you remember timothy hutton and jacob's ladder in that second that he  was dying on the operating table he lived an entire whole nother life which was an atonement for all the  mistakes he made while he was really living and that's basically what this was they were all just 
[00:34:30]  trying to atone for the mistakes that they had made so that they could move on and i saw jacob as  basically just an angel that was trying to guide them to the light or maybe uh maybe or maybe a  right guiding them to the light right make or some kind of a of a of a decision they had to make  before they moved on maybe him and the other him and his dopey brother were just uh both there with 
[00:35:00]  kind of like to tempt them either way like you're either going to go up or you're going to go down  you know it's a very basic belief in heaven and hell or whatever you look at yeah but it was basically  just a remake of jacob's ladder only over six years okay yeah i don't remember jacob i saw many many  years ago i just don't remember it lewis black is in that really yes he is a doctor yeah uh but  more importantly um who is the manager for uh uh driveshaft booking such an awful gig for them 
[00:35:30]  what a terrible concert that was that was a terrible concert that was awful and daniel farad that hat  and he wore that hat on kimmel i i would love to see that hat removed in a vestibule  by fucking by wolf's fist that fucking hat daniel faraday had on was horrendous terrible see  kimmel to me matthew fox on kimmel and kimmel was okay i mean but i i did kind of like you saw it  right to me matthew fox even said they were talking about having it uh kimmel said something like 
[00:36:00]  he thought that this whole series was jack's test i guess about moving on and jack you know and  matthew said something like yeah kind of he goes but that happens in different time periods for  some people that happens in a nanosecond and for some people it happens over a longer period of  time but when he said that it just again i kind of confirmed that kind of open-ended though where  it could have been both i have to jump in because i have that audio you're talking about right here  i want to present you if i could with my theory on on what happened okay 
[00:36:30]  in a lot of religions christianity being one of them the idea is that life is a test that you go  through your life and if you're good you go to heaven or nirvana or whatever and if you're bad  you don't you go to hell or you don't go anywhere my theory is that the whole show from beginning to  end we were watching jack's test his test and his life on the island i think was his real life 
[00:37:00]  yes and you think okay i completely agree on a roll yeah yeah and obviously jack passed the test  yes and maybe the characters maybe each of the characters has their own story and their own test  but this show i think was jack's test i i i would agree with that i mean um i'm so proud of myself  right now yeah then this is the answer huh they don't have matthew fox's response 
[00:37:30]  he just gave you a kimmel and not the guy who was in the show  you got leno's commentary too  have a fucking he's just ready to say something what's matthew fox's response  just ready to say something do we have that hope or is that that's all he gave us  it would still be playing if we had it with it what's the deal with faraday's uh mother and uh  and that's my that's my biggest question like like because she asked uh you know are you are 
[00:38:00]  you taking my son right yeah she was very she was not happy that that desmond was continuing  doing these shenanigans and i want to know why and then he said no but he's not maybe the mother's  in purgatory or maybe the mother is dead as well and maybe she's having some time with her son  and she's saying is it are you taking my son meaning is he moving on now oh okay and he goes  no not yet you know something that makes sense so maybe maybe she was finally enjoying some time  with her son in this place and she wasn't ready to move on and she was afraid that he was okay 
[00:38:30]  i'll buy that well a couple more here let's say hi to mike in union  what's up mike hi mike very good hey um i think that when they were in the church uh jack's talking  to his father they kind of touched on something and i apologize if this is already talked about it  just jumping in but his father said to him that he thinks you know he said everybody dies but it's a 
[00:39:00]  different time so what i was kind of taking from it is they sort of they went back in time they  detonated a bomb created the alternate timeline and it is real and then in that timeline they're  all sort of realizing that at some point or another you know they did all die and now they're just  coming together realizing their other life that and the other theme of the show is whatever happened  happens so at the end of the day everything still happened they still lived that first life  and now they're all coming back together very much yeah it's kind of the point travis was 
[00:39:30]  making but i don't agree with it because it leaves too much to be taken literally that i can't buy  and too much well to to be just kind of thrown out like they give you over six years and then just to  never show you sawyer's death or or juliette's death or kate's death or claire's death or mike to not  show you any of their actual deaths and to only kind of in some weird way show you the deaths of the 
[00:40:00]  other people then you know well i think the only people that you didn't really see die were those  people who did in fact leave on the plane as even though obviously tying a hydraulic system with duct  tape was a little bit silly but i actually do think that they were implying they actually left and at  some point they died and the reason i say that is because when jack talked to kate at the concert  she remembered him and she said i've missed you so much and so what she i think was implying was  during the rest of her actual life she remembered him and she missed him all during that time 
[00:40:30]  what what about people that were getting killed on the island like shot and stuff like that again  that was what was that that may have been they're moving on and the actions of whoever was shooting  them may have added or taken away from their atonement i don't know exactly uh we got the  answer from kimmel last night i'll find matthew fox thanks here we go but at the same time i mean 
[00:41:00]  that's i think what's beautiful the way that ends is that it's room for interpretation depending on  people's spiritual beliefs um you know i think there are also religions that believe that when you die  um you go to a place and that place can last for a nanosecond or it can be an extended period of time  where you have to remember your own death and all of the people that were instrumental that you love  the most and helped you the most and were the most important to you you have to remember all of them 
[00:41:30]  and in remembering them lead up to the moment that you died before you can move on to whatever's next  i want to look at a clip from the first episode of this season that's all that he said yeah but that  to me does not say it doesn't definitively say what i'm saying is 100 right either but it absolutely  does not say yes that was all literal and that all happened no no that's why i said it's that's  why it's so beautiful it's left open to interpretation he had just actually just seen the he had just  watched the finale he came out like almost a little misty-eyed he was saying he had just seen 
[00:42:00]  he knew that it ended with the eye closing uh but he did not i think see it as a whole right  yeah yeah image why doesn't one of the creators uh do an interview and just tell us something  maybe they will even if even if the answer is it's open to interpretation no they're going into  hiding for they said like they said a year ago that that they're just going to let it sit and let  everybody talk like we're talking now so we're eventually i think uh we can discuss this like  we discussed the sopranos for years exactly great it's better great uh-huh great uh let's say how to 
[00:42:30]  keith uh keith no okay you know what guys we're going to go to mr know-it-all mr know-it-all thank  god you're calling the show oh what do you have sir hey guys good morning good morning mr know-it-all  yeah i want to congratulate oh uh thank you problem on this show this thing was left open-ended  for a reason uh if you'll do some background the show's creators were really into the jim carroll 
[00:43:00]  band in the early 80s uh you guys probably played their music people that died yes you got it you  got it yeah okay they threw that out there so they could get our response as to where this thing  could have possibly went so that's what what you got from mr know-it-all is there any other  any other questions that's bothering no it all doesn't know anything now how about mr explain one  thing mr know-it-all is a cunt yeah but you you didn't ask mr know-it-all a question what's wrong 
[00:43:30]  with you guys we got we got an opportunity here anyone have a question for mr know-it-all  anything it doesn't anything come on arms uh politics i'm not interested in your new character  when did they all die mr know-it-all they all died immediately within microseconds after the crash  and i never i like this guy i never saw the first episode you never saw any of it no no i just got 
[00:44:00]  i got a feeling from it that's what it's mr feeling all i'm serious i listened to you guys this morning  talking about the finale and i'm thinking it's got to be what happened let's go on to something else  real quick no no no blow me mr know-it-all what's wrong with you guys i love mr know-it-all he's an ass  what do you want to move on to mr know-it-all hey the anything's open the oil problem firearms uh  oh you said that already yeah yeah uh come on man you can give me something no all right mr know-it-all 
[00:44:30]  you call back anytime thank you sir uh the church was in the fourth season the island must be held  be held because an interracial couple lived there uh they were in hell the entire time another theory  coming in the island was finding something to live for and misty agrees with jimmy the island  was fine what loss is like a seven layer cake oh i like this steve c checking in steve c  hello boys hi steve c after going reviewing the tapes i realized that lost is like a seven layer cake 
[00:45:00]  each one of their lives is like a layer you're gonna eat one of those layers at once but they all go into  my big delicious building looks like our lost discussion has fallen apart falling apart at the  seams all right why don't we take a break we could continue with the lost thing right yeah we have a  whole uh big audience i think that we're talking to now from uh are we on stars as well i think so  so we're on a lot of the serious people hearing us for the first time hey what's up uh to everyone

[00:51:00]  The Simpsons?  What year is this?  We've got some weird people calling it.  Are these the people that usually  listen to stars too? It must be.  Well, I like watching  Biggest Loser and the season finale is Tuesday.  And we're going to have an  ending to this show.  We're going to have an ending to this series.  We're going to find out who lost  the most weight and  is deemed the biggest  loser. There's going to be no 
[00:51:30]  questions after the final episode.  I would rather toil over  a kind of  interpretive ending  than watch those  god-fucking reality  shows where fatties  are paraded on scales  or some bitch has to  suck a rich guy's dick to  fucking get... Oh wait, that's my house.  Wait a minute.  Like, I just...  I can't  fathom watching those 
[00:52:00]  fucking shows. Speaking of those  fucking shows, did you take a peek at  Celebrity Apprentice during the commercial  break? No!  I heard there were a lot of commercials during Lost.  You had a chance to, you know, slide over there  and see what was going on. I wasn't fucking moving.  You got to see our pal  Brent Michaels walking very, very  slowly and just depressing the hell  out of everybody.  Yeah, his fucking brain  was swimming in his own blood.  We got...  Of course, he was feeling a little  under the weather.  We got a couple clips 
[00:52:30]  from Celebrity Apprentice  because Brett's back.  He explains to everybody  on live TV  what happened to him.  There's people crying.  Donald Trump's telling  this one not to cry.  I'd be like, hey, Donald,  thanks for the fucking  diagnosis there  when I was laying  in the hospital.  Exactly.  And also, by the way,  if the guys could pull the tape,  I told Brett Michaels  six months ago,  I said congratulations  on winning  Celebrity Apprentice.  I knew.  Oh, great.  Why didn't you tell him  he was going to have  a brain hemorrhage?  I knew that, too,  but I didn't want  to bum him out.  You didn't want  to bum him out?  I didn't want  to bum him out.  Nice one there, Kreskin.  You couldn't fucking 
[00:53:00]  let the guy in  on a little secret.  I figured there was,  you know, nothing  that he could do.  Oh, my God.  Look, this from Dwindle One.  Opie is Jacob.  Thank you.  Wow.  It's about time  you guys noticed that.  I do see...  Damn, you knew.  I do see some  very strange things.  You knew.  I knew the whole time.  Here's Donald  Brett Michaels back.  All right.  Holly, that's so beautiful.  You're crying.  Well, I mean,  who in America is it?  But I never cried 
[00:53:30]  about my opponent.  Holly, it's so beautiful.  You were crying.  He really steps up  the emotion, doesn't he?  Yeah.  With his fucking  anal opening mouth.  Well, you know,  let's talk about this  for a second.  That's very good.  See, Donald Trump...  What makes Donald Trump cry?  Because before you answer...  Losing a lot of money.  Brett Michaels...  White hair.  ...walks out on the stage  and it's obvious  he's still recovering.  He can't move that well  from his waist down.  He's kind of shuffling  across the stage. 
[00:54:00]  So this Holly Pete,  I think her name is, right?  Holly Robinson Pete.  She's crying.  She's the other finalist  in Celebrity Apprentice.  21 Jump Street.  Yeah, you got the crowd crying  and you got viewers  at home crying  and Donald Trump's surprised.  Why are you crying?  Why are you crying?  What makes this idiot cry?  Hmm.  Probably alimony pants.  Wind.  Wind.  Wind.  I mean, who in America isn't? 
[00:54:30]  But I've never cried  about my opponent.  I mean, what are we doing here?  Come on, Mr. Trump.  My five-year-old son  woke up this morning  and said,  Mom, I love you,  but I'm kind of  pulling for bread.  How do you beat that?  Well, you know what?  You have been amazing  and it's going to be very close  and I really still have not  made a decision,  but I will say this.  I love the guy.  He's been through a lot.  Let's talk to him.  I love the guy.  Thank you.  See, he's like a robot,  I think, this Donald Trump.  Oh, let's talk to the guy.  He's got no charisma. 
[00:55:00]  No, you got Bret Michaels.  It's a big story in America.  Yeah.  It's pulling at a lot  of people's heartstrings  and he's like just a robot up there.  Ugh.  So he talks to Bret Michaels.  So you almost didn't make it.  I spoke with your doctors.  So you almost didn't make it.  So you almost didn't make it.  It's not a business deal.  Right.  It's the guy's life.  Jesus Christ.  So you almost didn't make it.  I spoke with your doctors.  They were really like,  they must have done  a hell of a job, right?  They did a great job.  I was really fortunate 
[00:55:30]  because we reacted quickly  when the hemorrhage happened.  Got to the hospital  and the doctors,  Dr. Zabransky,  and everyone narrows out of it  for about three days  and a great medical team  and good people  and I cannot thank you  and your family  for all the well wishes.  It was great.  But Bret, they didn't want you  to be here tonight.  No.  Are you risking at all?  Right.  Believe me.  Not at all.  Are you risking your life  being here?  This is a lot of pressure.  Lately it seems like me  just standing up  is risking my life  so I'm just...  I've become like the rat boy,  the medical experiment over here. 
[00:56:00]  It's one of those things  where everything that happens  just is, you know,  it's been crazy honestly  for about a month and a half.  I've felt I was healthy.  I love being on the show  and it's been a rough go  but I'm glad I'm here  and yes, it's been a risk  but I wanted to be here  and I all respect to Holly.  I said this, I said,  I didn't travel this far  in this much pain to lose.  I came to win  and I'm glad to be on the show  with all due respect.  Holly, what was your reaction?  Wow, great timing, Donald. 
[00:56:30]  Great timing.  Holly, what was your reaction?  We're in the middle  of a standing ovation.  Obviously, that was going to get  a reaction from everybody.  Stupid Donald Trump  doesn't know how to do stupid TV.  Who's he kidding?  He knows how to do stupid TV.  He doesn't know how to do TV.  His run's just about over  with this Apprentice show.  Yeah.  And a little observation.  I think it's official  that Bret Michaels  is wearing some kind of wig.  Didn't he have brain surgery?  And he's got the flowing locks  and everything?  Oh, wait a minute.  Wouldn't they shave his head? 
[00:57:00]  Shave part of it?  Something?  Oh, jeez.  Was he wearing the bandana?  That's his look, man.  The hat.  If he was going to die,  he said he wanted to go out rocking.  He said that on Oprah.  He said that on Oprah.  Huh?  Should have had Faraday's hat.  Faraday's fucking hat.  You liked it, Jimmy?  Fedora he had on.  Fucking Oswald  should have removed it for him.  It was terrible.  And he wore it on Kimmel, too.  It was like,  stop trying to have a style.  Fucking corny,  lower east side,  white guy look.  Fuck you.  They try to look interesting  with a hat. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, let me go to Kelly  in Kansas City.  Kelly.  Yeah, hey,  on the Fox ticker,  yesterday said  Brett Michaels  had a heart attack.  Yeah, he also had like a,  I don't know if it was  a heart attack  or a stroke  over the weekend.  Jesus.  And now he's on this  Celebrity Apprentice Live  last night.  He's a mess.  Oh, really?  Okay.  I thought maybe  I thought they said stroke.  You might be right.  You might be right.  It might have been  some kind of a,  you know,  heart attack thing.  I don't know.  But yeah,  he had another  emergency over the weekend. 
[00:58:00]  Jesus.  Poor fuck.  If he's got nine lives,  how many do you have left?  Well, that's a good question.  That's a good question.  You want to figure out  how many lives  Brett Michaels has left,  Jimmy?  That's a good question.  Why don't you ask Jimmy?  Jimmy wasn't paying attention.  He was doing something.  What'd you say, sir?  Jimmy,  with all the problems  Brett Michaels have.  I heard you.  You really fucking fit?  Hey, Jimmy,  when's your next gig? 
[00:58:30]  Hey,  you hung up.  This Friday night?  Well, answer it.  Yeah, answer it.  This Friday night in Seattle  at the Showbox Theater.  Two shows.  Say hi to BJ Shea.  Yeah,  I'll see those guys  Friday morning.  One more clip  from Celebrity Apprentice  with Brett Michaels.  The only reason  we're doing this  is because Brett Michaels  almost died a couple times  in the last few months.  She's growing  the tear card now.  Hey,  I gotta work  what I can, baby.  You've been popular.  Everyone's loved you.  You've been imaginative.  You've done an amazing job  in every single way.  A little flaky, 
[00:59:00]  but that's okay.  You've really proven,  and maybe this is unfair,  but you've also proven,  and I think Holly  would really agree,  you've been proven  to be very brave.  Yes.  And I appreciate that,  and everybody here  appreciates that.  Thank you.  Holly,  you won more money  than anybody  has ever won  on The Apprentice  or The Celebrity Apprentice.  You won a lot of money  for your charity,  and I'm very,  very proud of you.  You've been amazing.  You lost a couple of times  as project managers,  but we can forget that.  Holly,  I have to tell you, 
[00:59:30]  we all love you,  and Brett,  I have to tell you,  you're hired.  You're hired.  Hired for what?  You're hired.  What is he hired for?  I don't know,  but it sounded like  fired with a huh.  Huh?  Yeah.  Man,  he tricked everyone.  Boy,  I thought he was  going to give it to Holly  until the last second, 
[01:00:00]  and then he said,  Brett,  you're hired.  It was crazy.  Crazy TV last night.  Poor Brett.  Huh?  Poor Brett.  It's terrible.  What is he hired for?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  Does he work for  Donald Trump now?  I don't know.  Yeah,  what's he doing?  What's he doing for Donald?  Knowing Donald Trump,  he'll throw him  in the mail room.  What the hell?  What was that show about?  I've never seen an episode.  I don't know what they do.  I know.  I don't know what their job is. 
[01:00:30]  I have no idea.  Shouldn't he just have said  you won?  Yeah.  Here's your money,  and then Brett goes back  to rock it,  and Donald Trump goes back  to whatever he does,  and that's it?  You'd think.  Or Brett Michaels  now works for Donald Trump.  Yeah.  Explain.  Explain.  He's going to go in every day?  Imagine.  Hi, Mr. Trump.  Cut your hair.  Yeah.  Take off your wig.  Would you want to work  for Donald Trump?  No.  Seems like a real prick.  Yeah,  I wouldn't want to work  for Donald Trump either. 
[01:01:00]  No.  Well,  he would never hire us.  I wonder if all this  fucking grief he's having  is because that fucking  piece of stage setting  hit him in the back of the head.  Seems that that was  the catalyst to this  whole thing, right?  I don't know.  That seemed like a big,  heavy fucking stage thing.  Locked up.  Hitting him on his head.  All right.  So there you go.  So that was another season  finale right there.  Ah, well,  unfortunately not a series finale.  Huh?  I think it is a series finale. 
[01:01:30]  You think that's it?  Didn't we look at the ratings  for Celebrity Apprentice?  A little down?  Wasn't it so-so?  So-so?  Because so-so says so.  You expect me to believe  Brett Michaels wears a wig  because so-so says so.  And Travis must be very,  very upset tonight.  Jack Bauer.  Oh, I thought you were...  That's it.  No one is talking about that,  by the way. 
[01:02:00]  Everyone on Fox  is talking about that.  On Fox.  On Fox, exactly.  No one else is talking about it.  It's going to be good.  What a dud that series became.  Yeah, you know what?  That series completely fell apart.  Of course, talking about 24.  What a dud.  Eight seasons, you know,  it's hard to have good seasons.  That one petered out.  Eight seasons.  Yeah, but...  He's more exciting off the show.  Exactly.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So eight seasons.  Danny and I want to start  a Facebook group  about wanting to drink  with Kiefer Sutherland. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, it just...  You might not like  what he enjoys drinking.  That's not true, Jimmy.  Well, we don't know.  I know what you're insinuating.  There's a lot of hints out there.  He loves...  Oh, really?  He loves being short-lived.  Look at that.  Look at that, Travis.  Like, it might take it  right out of the tap.  Yeah.  Like, he may actually  squeeze the tap and...  Ah.  That might be where  the anger comes from.  Maybe not accepting things.  Maybe he needs to go  to the island  and...  That's right. 
[01:03:00]  ...resolve a few issues  with himself  as he fucking  puts a hog in his mouth.  Yes.  It's going to be a rough...  Yeah.  It's going to be a rough night  for Travis.  24 ends  and also your hockey season  ends tonight.  That's not necessarily true.  As the Flyers take out  the Canadians  and play for the Stanley Cup.  And I'm not even a Flyers fan,  but I have to kind of  root for them a little bit.  You don't want the Blackhawks  winning the Stanley Cup,  do you?  No, I want the Canadians.  That ain't happening.  What is it?  Three shutouts  out of four games?  Yeah.  That's rough.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Well, we've been down  three to one before, so...  And what?  And they've won.  Yeah.  Wow.  So let's see what happens.  Sounds like they have  a lot of confidence.  Well, you know,  they haven't looked  too sharp so far.  Fucking Flyers  coming out of nowhere.  Peeking at the right time,  some would say.  I hate when sports  fucking talk radio  talks about a team  peaking at the right time.  You don't like when they say  it all depends on  who's hot in the playoffs?  Yeah, it's all that nonsense.  They're peaking  at the right time. 
[01:04:00]  And Obama wants  LeBron James  to go to Chicago.  Oh, yeah?  To do what?  To win some more  championships for the Bulls.  Oh, about to fight crime  or something.  I think that would be  a dumb move  on LeBron James' part.  Yeah.  Because then you're living  in the shadow  of the great Michael Jordan.  Why would you want  to do that?  Well, they would always  be comparing him,  wouldn't they?  Of course they would.  Yeah.  And then they would have  to win a hell of a lot  of championships  for people to even say  that he was the greatest  bull of all time.  That he's doing something.  You just want him  as a Knick. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, because then  I would start watching  the Knicks again.  I can't tell you  the last time  I was actually  a true fan  of the Knicks.  I guess when it was  a good time  to jump on the bandwagon  when they were winning.  Honestly,  when we got  Patrick Ewing,  we're like,  oh my God,  we're going to have  so many championships.  Didn't win a one.  So it's been  a long drought.  Remember how much  you enjoyed  his fadeaway jumper?  Oh, we used  to talk about that.  Yes.  You're a seven foot  four monster  and you're taking  fadeaway jump shots. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Here's a guy  called Don't Watch TV.  Oh.  Or Doesn't Watch TV  wants to check in.  Doesn't Watch TV.  Yes, sir.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Hello.  Hey, I don't watch  much TV,  but this has been  enlightening this morning.  What's the story  with Bret Michaels?  What?  He's on a show?  He's sick?  Is this bad character day?  This is, uh,  yeah.  Is this bad character day?  Never took an acting lesson.  Uh, guy  is on the phone right now.  Hey, guy. 
[01:05:30]  Well, I got to...  Did Bret Michaels,  did something  happen with him today?  Yeah.  Mr. Faber-Sham?  It's out of the question.  Out of the question.  Hey, Mr. Faber-Sham.  Hey, I only got my news  from, uh,  placemats at, uh, diners.  Oh, you know what?  Don't make it about me  because you're bombing.  He's a radio callback guy, too.  Yeah, exactly.  Your character's bombing,  so you're gonna try  to fucking push it on me?  You're a guy who called up  with the wrong name guy.  Exactly. 
[01:06:00]  I really want to know  what Bret Michaels  is gonna be doing now  that he's hired.  You heard Donald Trump.  You're hired, Ed.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  He's gonna be sitting there  if somebody just started  typing,  numb arm,  numb arm,  numb.  Like he's,  he'll just sit at his desk  talking about  his arms going numb.  Calling ambulance.  And by the way,  the regular apprentice  is back in the fall,  and you're gonna get 
[01:06:30]  another celebrity apprentice  in the spring, so.  Ugh.  What do I know, man?  Donald Trump is gonna be  doing TV for everybody.  Uh,  Dana White coming in  at 9 o'clock today?  Yes.  What does he got?  A new video game  he's pushing?  I do believe, yeah.  He's doing TV  all over the place  here in New York, I see.  Every time I look up,  he's on another TV show,  which is cool.  Well, uh,  what, video game?  A new one?  I believe so.  It's time already.  Time for another UFC game.  The first one's  like a million copies  in a month. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, it was huge.  Been playing, uh...  Oh, Red Dead.  Red Dead, and, um,  people have been sending me  video clips  and, uh, photographs  of how they have  just tortured my character.  Well, I saw one  where you were tied  to the train tracks.  One gentleman, uh...  With a bandito.  Yeah.  With a gun  just kind of hovering over you.  He, he, um,  took his lasso  and tied me up  and threw me  on the train tracks  and then just sent me  the picture  and said,  well, waiting.  Just waiting  for a train to come by  and kill me.  Did the train ever come by?  Because I got that,  I got that picture too. 
[01:07:30]  That, I went in  and actually beat  the shit out of myself,  which was fun.  And I listened to myself  whining and running away.  That's nice,  but, uh,  do you like this game?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  I, I think  you're not really  playing a game.  I think you're dead  the whole game.  Oh.  And...  It's an alternate timeline  where you're not a cowboy,  you're an Indian.  Yeah.  Did it feel good  beating yourself up?  Yeah, it was kind of cool.  I was, I was really, uh,  Did you resolve some issues?  Yeah, I resolved some issues  by clocking myself 
[01:08:00]  in the head.  Danny brought up  a good point, though.  The, um, the game itself  is not like Grand Theft Auto  where you can just go around  and beat the shit out of people  as long as cops aren't watching  and stuff.  Uh, if, if you pull your gun  out in town  and shoot at something,  people will start shooting at you.  Right.  So you gotta kind of be  a little more careful.  Well, you had that in  Grand Theft Auto  depending on who you were  messing with.  Depending on where you are,  I guess, yeah.  But you're saying in this game  every time you mess with something  there's some kind of consequence?  Yeah, they're a little more 
[01:08:30]  oversensitive about you  pulling your gun out  and, and just shooting at shit.  What if you're in the middle  of the desert?  No one's looking.  How are they gonna know  you just killed somebody?  Well, that's true.  See, that's fine then.  Then you can do that.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, but, uh,  there was, there was one point  where I, I started a fist fight  with a gentleman  and I started punching him  about the face  and he fell down.  Um, but he kept getting up  and I had to go on a mission  so it was the first time  I was hopping on my horse  and I didn't know  how to make the horse run.  So, so I beat this guy up. 
[01:09:00]  Um, I get on my horse  and start walking away.  The guy comes running over,  rips me off the horse  and starts beating  the piss out of me.  Uh, so I punch him again  until he falls down.  Get on my horse.  And then when I,  I went to punch him,  I accidentally hit another guy.  Yeah.  So now I got two guys  beating on me  and trying to get on my horse.  I know you're explaining  those dreams  where you need to run  but you can't run.  I couldn't fucking run.  You know what I mean?  I couldn't get out of there.  You're on the horse,  all you have to do is gallop 
[01:09:30]  and you're out of the fucking danger  and it just takes forever  and now you got two guys  fucking pulling at your legs  and all you want to do  is get the fuck out of there.  I had no idea  that I had to tap A there  to get the, uh,  get the, the horse going.  That's great.  Um, and then my shooting,  uh, prowess,  not very good  in this game.  Are you doing,  oh, you have to do  the game console.  You're getting more comfortable  with the game console.  I wish it was a mouse  and keyboard  but, uh, the game console,  I, I, yeah.  Is that easier  than a, uh, console really?  A mouse and keyboard?  It loves the keyboard. 
[01:10:00]  If a console controller  was easier,  you'd plug them  into your computer  to run your fucking mouse.  It would be,  wouldn't it be easier?  A mouse,  you don't even think.  It's second nature  to just, you point,  click, click, click, click.  You could hit anything.  But how do you move stuff?  Like, if you could use  both hands,  your left and your right thumbs,  how do you use  your left hand  on a keyboard?  You're on your keyboard  with your left hand  and your right hand's  on the mouse  and you're fucking,  you're working it.  You're working it.  You're working your  forward, backward,  W-A-S-D. 
[01:10:30]  Yes.  What's W-A-S-D?  That's your forward,  backward,  side to side.  See, I've,  I've watched you play  games on a keyboard  and a mouse.  It's pretty amazing.  It's second nature.  To me,  the console's way easier.  It becomes second nature.  Way fucking easier.  When I try to aim  with the console controller,  I'm constantly, like,  sweeping and overshooting  my target.  Right.  Or I can't zero in.  I could zero in a headshot  with a mouse and keyboard.  No problem.  That's because...  Trying to do it  with a console controller,  it's like fucking pan-ass. 
[01:11:00]  That's because at our age,  we're not supposed  to be playing video games.  We have old man fucking nerves.  Console is so much better.  Console is so much less  less accurate.  See, and that's  in the same thing.  Well, people will argue that.  Console isn't better.  It's a known fact.  Some people would say  console's better, though.  Maybe for them,  because they haven't  played games on the computer.  I have no idea.  But you know what?  They've proven  that mouse and keyboard  is more accurate  as far as zeroing in 
[01:11:30]  a reticle.  All right.  We're not going to solve  that argument right now.  No.  But Red Dead Redemption,  what do you think?  How many hours did you play?  I played a couple hours.  Did you like?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you do storyline  or were you just fucking around?  I was doing storyline.  I'd fuck around a little bit.  Like, I took a shot at a lamp  and didn't realize  that they're all gas lamps.  Oh, shit.  I thought it was a light bulb  and it was just going to go like poof.  Nice.  And it made so much fire  that I thought,  wow, that's kind of good to know  if somebody that you want to kill  is standing near a light,  you just shoot the light 
[01:12:00]  and you fucking set them on fire.  So that was cool.  And then we got so wound up,  we had to go to the range.  Oh, really?  Shoot real guns.  Oh, how cool is that?  Danny getting very proficient  with the AR-15.  Getting good at the gun already?  Iron sights.  Not using an optic  or a scope or anything.  Wheeling it out  to fucking maximum in the range.  What is that?  25 yards over there  is all they got?  No, the NASA range.  It's only 30.  Yeah, 30 yards.  But iron sights.  I don't know what that means.  Standing there. 
[01:12:30]  Might as well talk about lost again.  Scope.  No scope.  Just using the sights  that come with the rifle.  Keep it easy for me.  Iron sights.  Iron sights.  The looky thing.  Thank you.  The looky thing.  At least I know what you mean.  The looky things.  And standing up.  So not leaning on anything.  That's cool.  So very good.  And I took the Eagle out,  which was always fun.  The .50 cal handgun,  which is just hysterical.  People stop to just watch that. 
[01:13:00]  They just look.  Is it loud?  They peek through  to watch you shoot that fucking thing.  Is it loud?  It is so fucking loud.  It's ridiculous.  It is so insanely loud.  Is that the one  where girls get hit in the forehead?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They get hit in the head.  And the shells  fly back  to like  the other side  of the range.  The shells  coming out of the gun  fly back.  Yeah.  But don't they have  a backboard behind you?  You know what I mean?  So what if someone's  walking in that area?  Yeah, then they get hit.  Wear your fucking eye protection. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  What can I tell you?  Well, what?  Danny got the...  What happened?  I have a mouthful of food,  but I also have a...  I mean, it's iPhone video,  but if you want to hear  how loud the gun is,  I don't know if it'll translate.  In contrast with the...  Is your gun shooting  at the same time?  No, no.  Yeah, that's always  a good contrast.  Hang on.  Wow. </pre>
