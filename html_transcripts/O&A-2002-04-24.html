<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a retrospective titled "The Opie and Anthony Timeline," tracing their career from their 1994 meeting.  This segment recounted their early days at WBAB, featuring a song parody ("Gun Electric Shock OJ") by Anthony's band, Rod Gut (with Brother Joe calling in to share memories), which led to their radio partnership.  The timeline detailed their move to WAAF in Worcester, Massachusetts, their tumultuous relationship with program director Dave Douglas ("Dave Dickless"), whom they repeatedly and vehemently insulted, and the creation of "Whip-A-Mount Wednesday," a segment involving women flashing their breasts. Their April Fool's Day prank announcing the Boston mayor's death resulted in their firing from WAAF, an event covered with audio clips of news reports and a phone call from Dave Douglas himself.  Humorous anecdotes included a goat incident involving spilled coffee and Opie living with Anthony's ex-mother-in-law for 18 months.  The overall tone was self-congratulatory but laced with bitterness towards WAAF and Dave Dickless.

The retrospective continued, focusing on their Boston experiences and syndication.  They discussed early censorship struggles (including a banned song "Living Dead Girl") and the shift to a talk-oriented format, initially met with listener resistance.  The feud with Dave Dickless and "Rock Hole" at a competing station (WAF) was a major theme, with Opie and Anthony employing highly offensive and insulting language to describe them.  They celebrated their syndication to Philadelphia (WYSP), their return to Boston, and WAF's subsequent ratings decline, which they attributed to Dickless's incompetence. Scorch called in to discuss his move to a new station and his website.  The hosts then reviewed their ratings across markets, noting strong performances in Philadelphia and Cleveland, but weaker ones in New York and initially in Washington D.C.  A rambling conversation followed, touching on the Pope's statement on priest pedophilia, a Comedy Central show featuring a graphic sexual description ("crinkle crinkle"), Opie's anger at Comedy Central's editing, a lawsuit over a radio host calling someone "chicken butt," human cloning, and Bigfoot.  The segment ended with announcements about a Boston celebration and their "WOW" campaign featuring topless women, and more insults directed at Dave Dickless and Rock Hole.

Andrew Dice Clay then joined the show as a guest.  The conversation started with Dice recounting stories of infidelity, including using gasoline and grease to mask the smell of perfume, and Opie sharing a story about being caught cheating due to a stray pubic hair.  The discussion involved various humorous hypothetical cover-up stories.  Dice Clay's in-studio appearance was lengthy and rambling, punctuated by cigarette-related antics (despite claiming to have quit), tangents about his career, and opinions on other comedians and movies.  His entourage, including Kenny ("Club Soda Kenny"), was also present.  A caller named Frenchie sparked a heated exchange with Dice Clay, with the latter using homophobic slurs. The conversation also included discussions of Dice Clay's past movies and acting style.  The segment shifted to Dice recounting a story about a damaged rental car in L.A. and a "movie" he made with another comedian, Bobby. He gave a brief, incomplete impression of a character, possibly Tony Slangini.  The hosts promoted Dice's upcoming shows.  Dice engaged in a repetitive chant of "Dice, Dice, baby," followed by a nonsensical exchange with the hosts.  Devin, a former child actor (Buzz from a Home Alone film), was also present. Dice displayed ignorance of the Home Alone movies, leading to a contentious exchange with the hosts about the films and Devinâ€™s career.  The conversation further included discussions about Macaulay Culkin and other child actors, with Dice making disparaging remarks.  Dice abruptly left for an Islanders hockey game, leaving the hosts to conduct a rushed, disjointed interview with Devin.  This included tangential discussions of Michael J. Fox, Family Ties, and Robert Goulet, before concluding with final plugs and goodbyes.

[00:01:00]  Yeah.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  We've got to get right into this today, Ant.  Ah, oh, uh-huh.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Oh, my God.  Can we do a triple?  Boston, Cleveland, and D.C.  Yeah.  Phone number for you, 866-277-4-WOW. 
[00:01:30]  866-277-4-WOW for those cities and everyone else outside of New York.  Man, oh, man.  I'm going to go to Cheryl.  She's very pissed off right off the bat.  Cheryl, what's wrong?  What did we do?  Thank you, guys.  What's up?  What's your own?  I'm upset with the both of you.  With the both of you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Because you weren't at work yesterday, and, you know, you had me waiting.  I count down the hours until 3 o'clock every day. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Yep.  And then at 3 o'clock, I never heard you guys.  Oh, who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  Guys, when did you say something the day before?  Well...  You know how disappointed I was?  Aw, see how people get disappointed when we're not here.  That's kind of fun.  I feel like I'm waiting on this delicious meal.  I count down the hours.  I count down the hours.  Hey, we had a pretty good streak going.  Four weeks without taking a day off.  But you should have...  Then I heard the thing with key, the cop. 
[00:02:30]  So I said, okay, fine.  It was a good thing for me, replaying it.  Yeah.  Well, we had...  Then I heard, oh, we're going to take a break.  Also, I said, okay, fine.  They'll be on after the break.  I got to be honest.  I had a scam going, and everyone caught me on it.  Yeah, because you weren't going to the island this game, right?  I know.  See, even Cheryl knows.  I like...  I know if you went to work, you wouldn't reach to the game on time.  Hey, I planted the seed, like, last week.  I'm like, guys, I'm going to the dentist, and I don't do well with the dentist, and it's 
[00:03:00]  more than a...  It's a little more than a cavity this time around.  So I don't know.  I don't know if I'm going to be up for working.  And finally, someone, you know, read the sports section of the paper and went, wait a minute.  Right.  My Islanders, I mean, first playoff home game in, I think, eight years.  Right.  I had to be there.  I know.  I know.  I said, you know what?  I want him to lose because he didn't turn up.  Well, they won.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  They kicked ass last night. 
[00:03:30]  Don't take off any more days for the rest of the year.  Perfect game, by the way.  We just killed the Maple Leafs.  6-1.  Yeah, I know.  End of the game.  A nice huge fight right in front of us.  Nice.  Oh, man.  I couldn't be happier.  But I was using the game.  How did little Gary like the game, Opie?  Little 12-year-old Gary, did he enjoy the game?  Hey, man, I had to bring my brother.  Oh, you didn't take him.  That's right.  Oh, okay.  My brother's a Big Islander fan.  Yeah.  So I had to bring him in.  You could take him to a playoff game. 
[00:04:00]  Playoffs.  No more days, okay?  All right.  No more days.  Somebody was saying, Cheryl, how come you couldn't predict that we weren't going to  be in with your tarot card?  I was saying, I know Opie would not be coming because I know Islander's playing.  I know he's not going to be in.  Wow, so you do have some magical powers.  You're just like Miss Cleo.  I'm seeing in the cards that Opie's not going to be in.  I'm seeing in the sports section.  The sports section.  Don't disappoint me again because I count down the hours every day just to hear you guys. 
[00:04:30]  You got it, Cheryl.  Okay.  All right.  Okay, bye.  I love you guys.  It's nice to be loved.  Thanks, Cheryl.  Okay, bye.  Yes.  All right.  And the love just shining through in multiple cities, Opie.  Multiple cities.  Stan from Hoboken.  It's great to see syndication hasn't changed you guys.  You're still lazy Fs.  Dude, man, we went four weeks without taking a day off.  Look at Dan, you bastard.  I know there's a faithful listener out there that can figure out the longest we've gone without  taking a day off.  Four weeks is about our limit. 
[00:05:00]  Is that it?  That's about our limit, Anthony.  I know.  There was a stretch where we went months without a day off.  I am sure of it.  I don't know, man.  It was ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Well, we missed a great day yesterday.  Yes.  Ratings are coming in from all over the place for the Opie and Anthony radio show, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Since we last talked, the ratings came in for D.C., Cleveland, and Boston. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And Boston.  Yeah.  I was very, very happy to see the ratings in Boston.  And, uh, oh, gosh.  I think we're going to start today with the ratings for Boston.  Hey, hey, guys.  Yes, Rock Hall.  Could you help me out?  I was really counting on my ratings bonus.  So I need a couple of bucks because it doesn't...  It seems I'm not going to be getting one in this book. 
[00:06:00]  Seems like you're never going to get another ratings bonus, Rock Hall.  Guys, Dave, what did you do to me?  I wanted to fight these guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, see the Dave Douglas strategy of not talking about this show and not acknowledging  the, um, make him believe we didn't exist.  Yeah, yeah.  And then when we talk about your fake radio, you don't try to defend it.  It all paid off for you guys at AF.  We're going to give you some news that AF will not be giving, uh, their, uh, their listeners,  Anthony. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  But I figure before we start, uh, to tell any of the ratings of Boston...  Yeah.  ...that we do a little, uh, what would you call it, Anthony?  Anthony, uh, retrospective, like a little retrospective.  That's something we like to call the Opie and Anthony timeline.  It was very, very important for us to get back into Boston, wasn't it?  Oh, hell yeah.  Everyone knows that.  And, um...  Our loyal following here in New York understood.  Give the people that turn their backs on Opie and Anthony, they're just desserts. 
[00:07:00]  That's right.  Right.  So Anne and I sat down and, uh, we put some thoughts together and, uh, we came up with the  Opie and Anthony timeline.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, it's kind of a, a little story about your pals Opie and Anthony.  Right.  Where it began and up to the present day, which is...  Present day.  ...the release of the Winter Ratings in Boston.  So we're going to start from the beginning, Anthony.  This will be a lot of fun.  Mm-hmm.  As we look back and reflect, let us reflect, on the events that got us to today. 
[00:07:30]  Right?  So, uh, we start our timeline, the Opie and Anthony timeline.  Mm-hmm.  With August 1994.  Wow.  We got to go all the way back to August of 94 for this?  Don't worry.  We'll be, uh, you know, fast-forwarding with this timeline.  Wow.  Well, we got to start from the beginning, August 1994.  Ah!  Oh, sorry.  I was having a flashback that I actually had to work for a living.  Well, you were...  Oh, Jesus.  That was scary. 
[00:08:00]  You were doing the air conditioner thing, Anthony.  I was.  Uh, so let me just read what I got for the Opie and Anthony timeline for August 1994.  August 94.  This is almost like a special.  Uh, yeah.  Like they put together on, uh, for TV.  Yeah.  Uh, it's written here.  While doing nights at WBAB on Long Island?  Yeah.  Opie meets Anthony.  Oh-ho!  The air conditioner installer.  Yes.  And it was love at first.  Yes, I was installing, uh, duct work. 
[00:08:30]  That's right.  For the wonderful folks at Apollo Air Conditioning in Bayshore.  What is that, Rick?  Well, uh, I guess Rick has a little taste of what it was like for Opie, uh, pre-Anthony,  I guess this is, right?  Yep.  B-A-B, who's this?  B-A-B-A-B-A-B!  B-A-B-A-B-A-B!  B-A-B-A-B-A-B!  B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B!  B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A!  B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B!  Wow! 
[00:09:00]  I really don't know what that is, Anthony.  I don't know what that is either.  I have no clue.  I think we have a regular straight, uh...  Opie played music.  He was a music jock.  Look, man, I'll be the first to admit that I try to do radio the right way.  The right way?  Well, the way they taught me in college.  M-hmm.  Okay, here we go.  Get a load of this, Norton.  WBAB, Long Island's home of drag and roll.  It's Opie cruising through a 102-minute commercial-free Long Island marathon  with Genesis up course, Elvis Costello, Veronica, Queen, B-52s, 
[00:09:30]  with some of that good stuff, and the boss in there as well.  The boss?  Oh, that's Springsteen.  Jimmy, that's like almost 10 years ago.  Isn't it funny now when you mention the boss,  usually scumbag is right after it or before it.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, my God.  Let me let that settle in a bit.  Hey, man, like I said, I'll admit I used to try to do radio the way they taught me,  and then I realized it was a bunch of crap.  Were you cruising through it, like you said? 
[00:10:00]  I was rocking and cruising.  We're cruising through.  And what did you call it, a Long Island music marathon?  And I do believe I was also rolling.  Right.  That's not all.  Help me out, Ant.  That's not the only thing I did.  I understand.  You don't have to sell me.  I got my bits in there.  I know.  It's just it was, you know, BAB was a music station.  And, you know, you played music.  It's called the back cell.  Right.  The back cell where you tell everybody the songs and artists they just heard. 
[00:10:30]  Let me tell you something.  Veronica.  Veronica.  Sometime this summer, I am bringing the first show you and I did together.  Yeah.  And I'll play that.  There's plenty of embarrassing moments on that tape, Anthony.  Yes.  All right.  So the Opie and Anthony timeline.  August 1994, while doing nights at BAB on Long Island, Opie meets Anthony, the air conditioner  installer, after his band Rod Gut submits the song, Gun Electric Shock OJ.  Right.  I remember it like it was 2,000 years ago.  Into the OJ song parody contest that I had run. 
[00:11:00]  Yes.  See, I was doing a bit, Anthony.  I see.  All right.  Right in between Veronica and the boss.  That's a good stuff.  There was a song contest.  People had to send in their song parodies about the OJ Simpson trial.  That's right.  Situation.  Opie thinks to himself, this is my first impression of Anthony.  He may look a bit strange with the big 70s afro, but boy, is he talented. 
[00:11:30]  Anthony used to wear his hair.  Well, I was in the band Rod Gut, as you know, and we were very, I don't know, very colorful  on stage, I guess you could say.  And I used to totally puff my hair out.  And the bigger, the better.  Right.  So it was just completely out of control.  Well, so we want to play the song that got us together here.  Yeah.  Here it is.  By Rod Gut.  Right.  Anthony's singing along here.  Right.  Me and Joe. 
[00:12:00]  Brother Joe.  That's...  I'm sitting in Los Angeles jail  And the judge won't let me post my bell  Now this could be the end of me  Cause California's got their death penalty  They're gone electric shot, oh, Jay 
[00:12:30]  Cook my behind like a chicken croquet  Ooh  They're gone electric shot, oh, Jay  Toast my behind  Nicole, I really loved that girl  But she had the worst look in the world  I was only cleaning my knife 
[00:13:00]  I accidentally stabbed her 36 times  They're gone electric shot, oh, Jay  Cook my behind like that cherry floppy  Ooh  They're gone electric shot, oh, Jay  Roast my behind  Looks like I'm a guilty man 
[00:13:30]  Love's got some women  Now I'm gonna have to love my hand  But what's worse  Don't make me flip my lid  I hear Michael Jackson is watching my kids  Oh, I know they cut me so slack  I'm an athlete movie star and I'm black  Whilst lawyers argue over my head 
[00:14:00]  While they be warming up that electric hotel  They're gone electric shot, oh, Jay  Cook my behind like a flounder fillet  Ooh  They're gone electric shot, oh, Jay  Roast my behind  There you have it 
[00:14:30]  There you go  That was the song responsible for me being here today  That's right  That song is now  That's it 
[00:15:00]  Eight years old, Anthony  Right  Brother Joe wants in on this  Yes, Joe  Hey, fellas  Hey, Joe was playing the music on that one, by the way  Joe playing the music on that one, thank you  That's right  And Anthony writing the words  I remember that was a very  He made that a very clear point  During litigations  When we did the Adam Smith after party  Right  At, what was it, over at the  It was at Eastside Comedy Club  It was at Eastside Comedy Club, yeah  Right  Yes, Joseph  No, but I called in to say that  To get that tape to Opie 
[00:15:30]  I mean, directly into Opie's hands  Because we, me and Anthony had done a couple of charities before that  Yeah  And submitted it to various radio shows  But in order to get it into Opie's hands  I stood at the back door of BAB for like 45 minutes  Banging on the door  Waiting for this shady character, Opie  That we only knew by voice  And arguing with Doug Yoel  Doug Yoel  He wanted to take the tape 
[00:16:00]  And, oh yeah, yeah  I'll give it to Opie  I was like, no  I want Opie at the back door now  Oh, thank God  He took the tape  Oh my God  Thank God  He took the tape  I would have been in an attic right now  As we speak  With a screw gun  With a screw gun and snips in my hand  No, I would have gotten you a position in the shop  No problem  Thanks, bastard  All right, Joe  Cool, man  All right, fellas  I'm listening to your timeline  Cool, thank you  Yes  If you're just tuning in  We're doing the Opie and Anthony timeline  That is going to end with the ratings that came out  For Boston yesterday, Anthony 
[00:16:30]  Yes  So, yeah  And his band submitted that song  And then  Dan from Hoboken wants to know  If Brother Joe's working on  Gun Electric Shock Robert Blake  Not a bad idea  And then we kind of decided  Today, man  You know, we get along  We got a chemistry  We're going to try to do some  That was working, right  What is left in this timeline  For August 1994  Anthony gets kicked in the nuts  By a goat  Right  And Opie has the goat  Relieve itself into the morning man's coffee cup  Hey, good morning to you 
[00:17:00]  How you doing?  Oh, that stood the God's honest truth  And soon after  Opie and Anthony have the Pancake Summit  At IHOP  The Pancake Summit  And decided to do a radio show  Together  Right  Hey, it's Bob Buckman  In the morning here  BAB  My coffee tastes a little weird today  I don't know what it is  Maybe it's just the morning  Or something  The coffee tastes a little off  This morning  Really fast  We had this guy  Bring a goat down  And the goat proceeded 
[00:17:30]  To take a dump  Yeah  All over the studio  Little pellets  Bouncing around  All over the place  And then the goat decides  Because I mean  He looked scary  With the big afro  Decided that  I don't know  Anthony was a threat  So I decided to  Head him in the ballies  Well, yeah  You know how goats can be  So we  Yeah  He reared up  And  Got me right in the crotch  And then  The goat  I could tell  Wanted to  Relieve himself  So I  Took the morning guy 
[00:18:00]  His coffee cup  Considering the guy  Was playing all my stuff  During the morning show  And not giving me any credit  I was a little pissed off  And I  I let the goat  Relieve itself  In the  It actually  Started  Relieving itself  On the rug  And Ovi goes  Uh oh  And grabbed the coffee cup  And put it under the goat  And let him fill it up  What left the  What left the worst taste  In Bob Buckman's mouth  That cup of coffee  I happen to work with  The radio check  Here in New York  I don't know  And then we went to

[00:25:00]  For 18 months  No don't  Don't do the universal fist  Like thrusting forward movements  For sex  No I have no idea why  Again  Opie decided to stay  Because  I was out of there  With the wife  Yeah  No it was a matter of weeks  Because  You know the ex-wife  Couldn't take living there  With her mom  So she was like  We're getting out of here 
[00:25:30]  Lickety split  But Opie decided to stay  For 18 months  He lived with my  Mother-in-law at the time  Yeah  And let us not  Let me enlighten you  On a little something too  This got brought up  In court  In court  During my divorce  Born to be wild  Born to be living  With my mother-in-law  Here's some of the questioning  From  Famed attorney  Dominic Farber 
[00:26:00]  During my trial  Is it true  That your on-air  Partner  Opie  Lived with your mother-in-law  For 18 months  All of a sudden  Now it's going to cost me money  Right  They're going to try to swing it  That  The reason  That we're so successful  Is for some reason  Opie stayed with my mother-in-law  For 18 months  Because she supported us  Right  Right  Some kind of support thing there  Oh my god  Opie do you want some breakfast  I'll cook for ya 
[00:26:30]  Tell Jim about how I broke  Everything in the house  Yeah and then he brought  Like she's got little things  All over her house  Like everyone has  A little ceramic  Little  Knick-knack and brick-a-brack  Hummels  And what not  And she had a phone cord  That was like  Three miles long  And that's one of the ways  Opie would break everything  You'd pick up the phone  And go walking around the house  With it  Because you can't stay still  And the cord is just knocking stuff  Off the shelves 
[00:27:00]  And little tables  And you would drop things  You broke stuff in the bathroom  All these little  You know  Oh there goes the horn  Off of my unicorn  But thank god  I love Opie  How did she know  You had left the bedroom  Did you put the thing  Back on the table backwards  All of a sudden  When you finally decided to leave  Yeah  She was very lonely 
[00:27:30]  Yeah  And then after  I got my divorce  Or started getting a divorce  From my wife  She wasn't going to be  My mother-in-law anymore  We had that  She had that big poster  Up in her house  Of us  Of us from the  Demented World poster  Yeah  And she loved Opie so much  She didn't want to get rid  Of the poster  So she cut it in half  So she only had Opie  You don't want that picture  Of me up in the house  Yeah  18 months  Yeah  She made quite an impression  On the old  On the old crone 
[00:28:00]  All right  Moving along Anthony  With the Opie Anthony timeline  It ends with the ratings  That came out yesterday  For Boston  Oh yeah  That's a little brief history  Of some of the things  We went through  Yeah  And it's going to start  Moving forward fast here  March 1995  March 95  Yes  After being at WAF  For only two weeks  Two weeks  Two  The man who discovered us  On Long Island  Leaves AAF  To go to New York  For a much better gig  Right  He tells us how good  The show sounds  As he's packing his boxes 
[00:28:30]  In his office  Yeah  He was like  Okay great great great  Great job great job  Goodbye  You guys sound great  Bye bye bye  Gotta pack gotta go  Goodbye goodbye  Like he was off  To another gig  Another gig  And we were all excited  You know something  I gotta explain this  When we went to AAF  Back then  Opie  Because I knew nothing  About radio  So Opie enlightens me  Like oh my god  This guy Ron Valeri  Is the boss  This guy is going to be  Great to work under  We're going to be able  To do a lot of the stuff  We want to do  Without a lot of 
[00:29:00]  Pain in the ass  Management getting in the way  Because this guy understands  The type of show we do  I mean you could not say  Anything more about Ron Valeri  He got us  And he got the show  Yeah  And unfortunately  He's now out of radio  And he's one of the best  Yeah so  But radio claims  Another victim  I mean  So he moved on  To other things  He can't take it anymore  This crap  So Opie  Very excited about this  And I'm like  Wow this is really cool  Great  He's there for a matter  Of weeks  Not even  Two weeks  Two weeks  Two weeks  Yeah yeah 
[00:29:30]  I gotta go  Gotta go  Goodbye goodbye  Goodbye  And he left  You know he went off  To a better job  What's he going to do  But we didn't know this  When we got hired  That he was going to leave  Right  And who  Is his replacement  He's packing his boxes  In his office  As he's telling us  How great the show sounds  He will be missed  Opie and Anthony  Have no idea  Idea  Their nightmare  Is about  To begin  Yeah yeah yeah  Soon after  Ron Valeri leaves  AF hires  Yes  Dave Douglas 
[00:30:00]  From Nebraska  There you go  Because that's  The kind of market  You want to delve into  To get a great  Great program director  For a major  East coast city  You want to go to Nebraska  And find a program director  Nebraska  Dave Dickless  Better known as  Right  Dave Dickless  The amoeba  The man without a backbone  The man without a spine  Douglas is hired to be  Technically  Our boss 
[00:30:30]  Right  The program director  At AF  April 1995  Then we're going to have  To take a break here  And continue  Less than one month  Later Anthony  Yeah  So we've barely  Been up there  In Massachusetts  Opie realizes  Dave Dickless  Is clueless  And can never be trusted  When he corners Opie  Near the coffee machine  This is another story  We've never told  Yeah yeah  This is great  This made me really 
[00:31:00]  Really like  Dave Dick  Douche  So he corners me  Near the coffee machine  This is a little over a month  Being up in Massachusetts  And asked why  I teamed up with Anthony  He didn't get it  He didn't understand  You know why  Because I hadn't done radio  And in Nebraska  Apparently  The only way you can ever  Get into radio  Is if you've had as much  Schooling and what not  As a Dave Dickless  You know  Perish the thought  That Opie saw somebody  That maybe had some raw talent  And wants to bring him on the show  Whatever  Or any radio show 
[00:31:30]  For that matter  Find somebody  That has raw talent  Or an appreciation  For radio  And just wants to get in it  Dave couldn't imagine  I couldn't fathom it  He'd rather you  Maybe fly a plane  Over Fenway  Right  And pick a seat number  And pick your sidekick  That way  Well yeah  And at this point  Anthony was doing radio  Less than a year  And how the business goes  You know  You've got to hire someone  With a bunch of  Right  Radio station  Call letters  Right  You're paying for it now  Aren't you scumbag  You're paying  Look at the book 
[00:32:00]  Dave  It's awful  God I can't stand that  So April 1995  Opie realizes  Dave Dickless  Is clueless  And can never be trusted  When he corners Opie  Near the coffee machine  And asks why  He teamed up with Anthony  I answer  Because he probably is  The funniest man  In radio today  You do  Thank you Opie  You're welcome my friend  I tell Dave to  F off  And go program music  Oh yeah  Right from the start  We weren't scared  Of this guy  After this exchange 
[00:32:30]  Dave becomes  A non-entity  In Opie and Anthony's  Radio career  Non-entity  Non-entity  Non-entity  That would be  That would be  A non-entity  Opie and Anthony  Start building  A loyal and rabid  Following with  Their radio show  Putting AAF  On the map  No thanks to  Dave Dickless  And the rest of  The management  At the station  Who seem to  Not understand  The toxic twins  Right now  A little audio 
[00:33:00]  Of our old boss  Dave Dickless  Dave Dickless  Continue the  Opie and Anthony  Timeline  Enjoy  He was always  Calling and  Harassing us  And bothering us  And telling us  Things we shouldn't  Be talking about  On the air  Right  Here's one of  Those phone calls  Hello  Hello  What's up  I just wanted to  Why are you on  This line  Well I figured  It was easier  Than getting out  Of my chair  And coming down  The hall  Oh  Just wanted to  Make a request  Yeah  Maybe we could  Steer the show  In a little  Different direction  So that this 
[00:33:30]  Doesn't get out  Of hand  What's getting  Out of hand  Well I think  We're going  Into the gay zone  And we all  Know where that  Where that leads  Wouldn't you agree  Not really  Pokey pokey  In the butt  No no  Licky licky  That's fun stuff  Yeah it's fun  But you know what  It's going to  Get us in trouble  Just you know  Steer somewhere else  If you keep  Going this direction  It's going to be  Trouble  I'm just  Worrying you  Not 
[00:34:00]  Not from me  I'm talking about  Outside  We've been down  This road before  The old dirt road  Yeah  Just giving you  A little heads up here  Alright  Okay  See ya  Uh huh  Uh huh  Hello  Going into the gay zone  Going into the gay zone  Going into the gay zone  Wanted to uh  Get out  Pokey pokey  In the butt  Yeah  Pokey pokey  In the butt  Gaze  Gaze  Gaze  On  Pokey pokey  In the butt  yeah, hokey pokey in the butt, licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, licky, the old dirt road, 
[00:34:30]  the old dirt road, licky, licky, licky, licky, the old dirt road,eman, hokey pokey in the  butt,ultan, boy moving to the gay zone, going into the gay zone.  Messingly licking with rubbish publicly, into the ass that youoph investments punch  behind, hedge sobie law at that time to throw me scomp questo  and first Rand Cochran, tu sei pas la mia croche ornaroo,  I love what this is all leading up to. 
[00:35:00]  I love it.  Yeah, we're going to have to take a break,  but we're doing the Opie and Anthony timeline.  It ends with what went on in Boston yesterday, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  The ratings came out in Boston yesterday. 
[00:35:30]  And we got some great news,  but we figured we kind of relived this whole Opie and Anthony thing.  I think it makes it a little clear why it's so important to us.  Yes.  To go back and just rip the A-holes out of you.  Right.  So the timeline will continue after this quick break with May 1995.  Opie and Anthony invent.  Wow.  Listen to me very carefully.  With a Mouth Wednesday. 
[00:36:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're reliving some career highlights.  Bear with us today.  All based on the fact that the Boston rating came out yesterday.  And that's what we're leading up to.  That's right.  We're doing the Opie and Anthony timeline.  Yes, we know we're gloating today.  Trust me.  We're not stupid. 
[00:36:30]  I think anybody that's a fan of this show would realize how important it is to us to,  and it was important to get up into Boston in the first place, back up there again, and to kick some ass.  That's it.  It's very important.  And if you're a fan of this show, I think you realize that.  All right, so we're doing the Opie and Anthony timeline.  I left off with April 1995, Anthony.  It'll move forward fast.  Opie and Anthony start building a loyal and rabid following with their radio show. 
[00:37:00]  We're putting WAF on the map.  Yeah.  It needs to be said, before we came to Massachusetts, none of the other Boston stations paid attention to AF.  No, it was pretty much a station that was relegated to the Worcester market.  Worcester.  Worcester, Massachusetts.  You know?  And one thing that, remember, Brucey Mittman said to us, he was the general manager at WAF when we got hired there.  He said, B-B-B-Boys, we're trying to get the station in the B-B-B-Boston market, not just W-B-Worster. 
[00:37:30]  So if there's any conversations that mention cities or what you're doing that night, maybe going to see a B-B-B-Band,  make sure you're talking about B-B-B-Boston and not Worcester boys.  Because we hate Worcester boys.  Yeah, we don't want to be a Worcester station.  We want to get into the Boston market and make an impact on the Boston. 
[00:38:00]  So it was pretty much, that was the point that AAF made us turn around to becoming a force to be reckoned with at the time in Boston.  So we put them on the map.  No thanks to Dave Dickless and the rest of the management at the stadium who seemed to not understand the toxic twins and what they were all about.  No thanks against the negative impact that that son of a bitch had on our show.  That guy knew nothing of what was going to make this show popular. 
[00:38:30]  And he did everything in his power to fight what we were trying to do.  Have a little fun.  Get up there and, you know, get on the air every day and have some fun with people.  Get people involved with the show.  The guy didn't understand.  He was from Nebraska.  Nebraska mentality.  He knows how to pitchfork hay.  That's it.  You see the picture of him and his wife?  He's standing next door with a pitchfork by the barn.  That's him.  That's him. 
[00:39:00]  You hillbilly.  You drink hillbilly.  All right.  May 1995.  Opie and Anthony invent.  Wow.  The greatest radio promotion ever.  That goes down in, I don't know, history like the invention of the light bulb.  That's right.  And the automobile.  That's right.  Wow.  Huge.  Huge.  Put wow in your car.  If the girls feel like it, they'll flash on the way home.  A quite simple concept.  Yeah.  That seemed to take off in Massachusetts, Anthony.  Yes, it did.  With homemade wow signs all over the highways because the station didn't want to support it, 
[00:39:30]  so we didn't get to do bumper stickers back then.  Who didn't want to see some boobage?  And everyone put the wow in their vehicles.  And everyone put the wow in their vehicles.  Dave Dickless, Anthony.  Dave Dickless.  Again.  Taking something that is instant publicity.  People like doing it.  It's not something you've got to force down people's throats.  This is a fun thing.  A fun thing that made our show more popular.  And what did Dave say?  Stop doing it.  They don't do this in Nebraska. 
[00:40:00]  Stop.  So with wow in their innovative radio style.  We're writing this in the third person.  So is wow in their innovative.  Sounds like a special.  They make AF the station to listen to in the Boston area.  That is the God's honest truth.  Right.  Fast forward to May 1997.  Everything is going pretty well for the boys as they continue to not listen to anyone  and do what they feel like doing. 
[00:40:30]  Exactly.  Following their intuition, Anthony.  If we would have listened to Dave Dickless, just look at Rocco.  Look at Rocco right now.  There you go.  That's what would have happened to the show.  Fake, lame radio.  The Opie and Anthony timeline continues with May 1997.  It ends with the ratings that came out yesterday, so bear with us.  Dave Dickless forces Opie and Anthony to stop doing wow. 
[00:41:00]  That's right.  Proving again he has no backbone.  None.  And unfortunately, at the time, Ant and I didn't have that much power.  We really had no choice in the matter.  A couple of groups of twats get together and send in some goddamn letters to Dave, and he buckles right under and says, stop doing it.  It's called publicity.  It's called, you know, getting the name of the show out there.  Oh, stop that.  Because it's all about me.  No, it isn't. 
[00:41:30]  Failure at that station's all about you, though, Dave.  You can take credit for that.  Ha ha.  Douchebag.  We stopped doing wow.  Yes.  May 1997, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  But not good enough.  Oh, no.  Because we got suspended.  Still doing okay.  Getting suspended left and right.  The real suspension's not the fake.  Hey.  And April 1st, 1998 comes about.  Right, right. 
[00:42:00]  Mm-hmm.  Opie calls Anthony.  I remember this like it was yesterday, yes.  And tells him his great idea for an April Fool's Day prank.  Great idea.  Yeah, let's tell our listeners that the mayor died in a car accident.  Right.  While vacationing in Florida.  Mm-hmm.  Opie doesn't notice that Anthony is barely awake when he says, okay.  Okay, sure.  Sounds great.  I'm going back to sleep.  Yep.  We go in the air.  We do it. 
[00:42:30]  You got some news.  Got some news.  Got some press out of it.  Pretty much know what happens from here on out.  April 2nd, 1998.  Yeah.  The last time Dave Dickless talks to Opie and Anthony.  Right.  To this day.  That's it.  It's over.  The last thing he ever said to us is, we are suspending you without pay.  Right.  And there will be an internal investigation.  To this day, Dave Dickless has never talked to ONA again. 
[00:43:00]  Nope.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  That's right.  With this Midwestern Nebraska mentality.  After all we did for AF, he decided to never talk to us again.  This is how the Dickless Dave works.  This is how he operates.  He'll try to use up anyone's resources to advance himself. 
[00:43:30]  And then if something happens, he will turn his back on you in a second.  In a second.  Look at Rock Hole's old partner that he had.  Was actually getting Rock Hole that tool a couple of numbers.  Was actually doing it.  Dave Dickless had a little disagreement with him.  And that's it.  Gone.  And Rock Hole didn't even argue the point with Dave.  Paying for it now, aren't you?  Paying for it.  Pay.  You'll pay until you're gone. 
[00:44:00]  That's right.  A sad day on April 9th, 1998, Anthony.  They stretched it out that long?  It was a week.  The Opie and Anthony timeline.  The boys are told to go to the Colonnade Hotel in Boston.  Yes, I remember.  On Huntington Avenue.  Uh-huh.  They sit across the 20-foot table from Don Belukas.  Yeah.  Right.  I remember this.  Better known as The Terminator. 
[00:44:30]  The Terminator.  Walking into the Colonnade.  The discussion between me and Opie.  Still, you think this is it?  You think we're getting fired?  And in hindsight, looking back, what else could we have thought?  They're taking us to a hotel conference room to tell us that we have our jobs back?  No.  They're firing us.  We go up there.  Don Belukas.  The Terminator.  The Terminator.  Terminator, in such sensitive style, says, we're going to have to terminate your contracts. 
[00:45:00]  That's right.  How I wrote it here.  There's not a hint of humanity in this cyborg's bones.  As he says, we're going to terminate your contracts.  Yeah.  Terminate.  My first thought is that we're not insects.  Yeah.  Terminate with extreme prejudice.  Right.  We're not insects.  Then it sinks in.  After putting AF on the map and making them an S-load of money, we're being tossed aside 
[00:45:30]  like a used whore.  Right.  We were fired!  Gone.  Yeah.  Hot.  You're hot.  Actual audio of Ant and I leaving the colonnade.  We're tanks for nothing.  Tanks for nothing.  Tanks for nothing.  You're fired!  Yeah.  Fired!  Yeah, they gave us the boot.  We immediately drowned our sorrows at Daisy Buchanan's on Newberry Street.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  And watched the news stations report on our demise, Anthony.  On our demise!  Gone.  At this time, O&A realized, and this is very, very important, and we live by this to this  day, at this time, O&A realized that they can never, never, never be completely loyal to  another radio station or company again.  That is it. 
[00:46:30]  Revelation!  We had a moment of clarity right then and there that that was the last time we would  ever listen to anybody giving us what they think is advice for this show, because only  we know what is best for this program.  Hell, we love the stations we're on, but the reality is we could never completely be faithful  and loyal to the stations we're on. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, Rocco, get ready for a visit to the colonnade.  And Dave's sitting with you.  Hello?  We're going to have to terminate your contract.  Uh-oh.  Oops.  Well, sorry to see you go, Rocco.  No, you too, Dave, you dick.  This time, Dave.  You too.  You too, Dave. 
[00:47:30]  So we are fired, Anthony.  Yes.  Fired.  This is kind of important.  April 10th, 1998.  You want to play the montage of us getting fired or we don't have time?  Oh, I don't know.  You want to play it?  Yeah.  All right, let's play it before we move on with the timeline.  This is how our firing was reported by the news stations in Boston.  WAAF DJ's Opie and Anthony, who like to refer to themselves as demented,  told their listeners Mayor Menino had been killed in a car accident.  At the time it aired, the mayor's wife, Angela, thought her husband was in a car on the way to the airport, 
[00:48:00]  so she thought it was true.  When the mayor's staff heard about the prank, they demanded a retraction.  Totally irresponsible.  Can anyone take a joke anymore?  Boston Mayor Tom Menino, thankfully, is alive and well,  contrary to a radio station so-called April Fool's Joke.  WAAF DJ's Opie and Anthony had announced on the air the mayor was killed in a car accident in Florida.  Tom Menino is very much alive and not at all amused. 
[00:48:30]  It was an April Fool's Joke, albeit a tasteless one.  Right.  But, you know.  Well, some of the listeners actually found it very funny,  and I do want to state that because we're getting a lot of, you know, flag that it was just, you know, shocking.  There was some comedic value to it.  Now, the mayor plans to file a complaint with the FTC,  and he may even sue the radio station.  WAAF management says they've offered to let the mayor throw pies in the DJ's faces to raise money for charity,  but tonight Opie and Anthony told me they will not go along with that. 
[00:49:00]  WAAF! WAAF! WAAF! WAAF!  This is where it gets stupid.  You ain't saying the mayor was dead to let's cross the line, huh?  Uh, yeah.  I just wish, I just, I feel bad that the mayor's, you know, wife heard him.  Who knew that the mayor's family is fancy to the Opie and Anthony show?  Tom Menino was very upset.  Adding to his anger was the fact that the on-air personalities never apologized.  We apologized to the mayor.  Never apologized. 
[00:49:30]  I am sorry, mayor.  I will not accept their apology at this time.  I am sorry, mayor.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  WAAF!  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  This is gonna get you fired.  I am sorry, mayor.  You make me sick, you fat sack of crap.  The station initially tried to parlay this incident into a publicity stunt.  Station owners did take the situation very seriously, and today, they acted.  Opie and Anthony repeatedly announced that Mayor Tom Menino had been killed in a car crash.  Now, WAAF has suspended the DJs indefinitely without pay. 
[00:50:00]  Mayor Menino is also seeking sanctions from the Federal Communications Commission.  Aw.  Let's kick it!  Today, Opie and Anthony were gone.  Fired.  Fired.  Opie and Anthony are unemployed tonight.  Opie and Anthony have been terminated.  Fired.  And that looks like the last you're gonna hear from either of these DJs for a while.  And if the former WAAF afternoon drive duo are looking for sympathy, they better not look on the streets of Boston.  I agree with that.  I think they should have been fired.  Absolutely. 
[00:50:30]  I think they should have been fired.  It's like someone saying that my mom is dead.  Opie and Anthony are off the air for good.  Losers.  Opie and Anthony have been fired.  It was all just a joke.  Opie and Anthony delivered the joke on April Fool's Day.  But the punchline knocked them right out of Boston radio.  They're dead air as far as their radio show is concerned.  That's no joke.  The station's keeping kind of a low profile, and a couple of its top DJs go to no profile.  Instead of delivering jokes, Opie and Anthony are going to be delivering audition tapes. 
[00:51:00]  Here, Benito, a comment on that tonight.  But in the statement, he said...  Hopefully, this incident will give all broadcasters...  Ha, ha, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Opie and Anthony, tell that Benito...  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Don't ask them.  Opie and Anthony, we're nobody's bitch.  Pretty much the last thing ever said before our firing on the airwaves, by the way. 
[00:51:30]  Can anyone take a joke anymore?  Anymore, Anthony.  There you have it.  That's how they reported our firing.  Boy, that was rocking.  I love that.  I love that, man.  Jimmy put that together.  He worked like eight hours on that for us a while back.  So the day after we got fired, April 10th, 1998, after getting rid of our hangovers,  we vow we'll get our revenge on Dave Dickless and everyone else that turned their backs on us and didn't support us. 
[00:52:00]  This is Earl's contribution to the bit right here.  The O.J.'s.  Yes, this is very appropriate.  Business as usual at the station.  And they hosed it down like Disney.  Just like Disney, when there's an accident at Disney, they hose down the rides and get them started again. 
[00:52:30]  Get the people on it.  Well, after we got the boot, Rock Hole slips into our time slot, which he had had during our suspension  and didn't even acknowledge he was filling in for us.  He just, he just, here he is, yeah.  All the time they want to take your place, the back of Stabler's.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All the time they want to take your place, the back of Stabler's. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  He was filling in for us during that week that we were suspended, where no one knew if we were going to be fired or not.  And instead of saying, hey, it's Rock Hole filling in for Opie and Anthony, hopefully they'll be back.  And nothing, never mentioned us, started playing his own little sweepers, made it his own show.  Because he was really hoping we would get the boot so he could get the afternoon shift over there, which he did get. 
[00:53:30]  And he's regretting to this day.  Well, I guess he had a few good years there before we came back.  But that's, that's the bitterness there.  You know, an acknowledgement that we were in that time slot.  Maybe talk about, maybe not listen to Dave Dickless at the time and talk about what happened.  Like Ozone and how, how cowardly and without a spine management was. 
[00:54:00]  Like the Ozone did for firing us.  Right.  Just like John Ostelin did.  We acknowledged the people that supported us.  He was doing the midday slot over there at AAF.  And the guy's a true, a gentleman.  And he's got a set of balls on him because he got on the air.  And even though Dave Dickless said, don't mention ONA, don't take calls about them.  John got on the air and talked about it.  Not Rock Hall.  No, this is mine now, baby.  Mine, mine, mine. 
[00:54:30]  Mine.  Mine, all mine.  Well, I hope you enjoyed the fun before we got into town, fat boy.  Hope you enjoyed the free ride.  April 10th, 1998.  After getting rid of our hangovers, we vow we'll get our revenge on Dave Dickless  and everyone else that turned their backs on us and didn't support us.  Turned their backs and walked away.  Little did we know that we'd have to wait almost four years.  Four effing years.  Our exile lasted a little longer than we would have liked. 
[00:55:00]  But in that four years, a bitterness built up.  Yes.  That is unrivaled.  Yes.  Our hatred.  I'm glad it took that long because I don't think our hatred was built up enough to come  back into that city, into Boston and rape you, rape you, rape your fat ass, you frauds, and  rape your mouth, Dave. 
[00:55:30]  Rape your mouth with your 70s porno mustache over it.  Wow, Ant, you're turning green over there.  Relax.  Can't help it.  Don't get me angry.  Yeah.  You won't like me when I'm angry.  Yeah, Rocco moves into our time slot, never calling us to see if we're going to be okay.  AF immediately begins doing their best to make believe we never existed.  Wiping the record clean.  Like they do in Russia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what they do in Russia.  Right.  Whenever a new leader comes about, what do you do?  You get rid of any record of the old regime. 
[00:56:00]  They just made believe we never even worked there, Ant.  That's right.  They had a whole retrospective on the station.  Historical retrospective on WAF in one of the trade magazines.  Friday morning quarterbacks.  One of the big radio industry trade magazines that go to all the radio stations.  So they did this whole thing about the radio station.  Not even a mention that we were there. 
[00:56:30]  Which, you know something?  I don't care.  Fine.  You want to play that way?  We'll come back and kill you.  Destroy you!  How is that?  How is it?  How is it, Dave?  Pulling our seed out of your mustache.  Pulling our man's seed, which is dried up now like mashed potato flakes all over your face.  All over your face.  All right.  So even though AF does their best to make believe we never existed, our loyal listeners see right through this. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  And I thank you personally for that.  Bless you.  We will never, ever forget that.  The emails and the calls after we moved to New York City.  Something else really fast.  Anne Marie, who worked at the station at the time.  Yeah.  She threw us a going away party, Anthony.  Yep.  We were bitter, but there were some people we kind of got along with at the station. 
[00:57:30]  So we went with it, you know?  Guy in promotions, Otto.  Otto was there.  Always enjoyed him.  Ozone was there.  All these people we mentioned are no longer with AF, by the way.  Right.  So Anne Marie throws us a really nice going away party.  Most of the staff blows us off.  Yeah.  And the only air personality that shows up is Ozone.  Ozone.  Johnny.  Where was Dave Dickless? 
[00:58:00]  Where was B-B-B-B-Boys?  Where was Dave Dickless?  Where was Brucey?  B-B-Boys.  Where was the Hillman?  Where was Rock Hole?  Brucey was suspended, too.  I'm so glad I can't see you.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's how you are.  Where?  Where?  Figuring out how to go on without acknowledging that we existed.  There you go. 
[00:58:30]  On June 1st, 1998, Opie and Anthony got kind of good news.  Huh?  Oh, kind of good news.  Oh, Jesus.  Opie and Anthony are hired at WNAW in New York.  Good news relative to what?  Cancer?  This crap hole.  To this day, it's still a crap hole.  Unbelievable. 
[00:59:00]  The unflushable toilet.  Almost four years ago, we're hired here in New York at WNAW.  The station is a complete disaster.  With dinosaurs roaming the hallways playing classic rock music.  Jurassic effing park, this place was.  No one is listening to this crap, Ant and I remember.  Thinking to ourselves.  We say, F the music, and we start talking a real lot, Anthony. 
[00:59:30]  I remember we had a music director here, like any station has.  We were playing a hybrid of classic rock, new rock, and I believe classical jazz mambo music.  I don't know what the format was at this place.  But anything that was cool was banned from being played here.  I remember one day, I came in with one of my favorite new albums.  And we got in trouble for playing Living Dead Girl.  Do you remember that?  That's right. 
[01:00:00]  Unbelievable.  It's safe to say that if you're listening to us right now, today, you were definitely not listening to us back on June 1st, 1998, when we hit the airwaves at this hellhole.  Right.  So we decide, F the music, and we start talking a real lot.  Yeah, because the truth of the matter was, when we started playing some of the music, we couldn't not comment on it.  Right.  When you're putting in hot legs, when you're putting in hot legs, you know, we can't just sit here. 
[01:00:30]  I believe halfway through hot legs, we pulled out the CD and started playing Rod Stewart baseball.  Right.  Where we would take all the Rod Stewart CDs and pitch them in and hit them.  These are awful.  And in order to do that, we had a talk.  Right.  And for some reason, that started working.  Well...  To the chagrin of...  Not at first.  The ice cream PD.  Because the hardcore listeners would say things like this.  This is not what I'm used to. 
[01:01:00]  This is different from what my normal daily experience is.  Be like everything else in my life.  That's what they were saying.  Right.  But we turned things around slowly but surely.  Over the next three years, we build an instant, insanely loyal following.  And we thank New York for that, Anthony.  Not instant enough for me.  They embraced us, Anthony.  Yes, they did.  We brought back WOW. 
[01:01:30]  The greatest radio promotion ever.  It becomes huge once again.  And might I say, even huger in New York.  Absolutely.  No offense to Mass, but it became huger in New York.  But with the support of a station.  Proving again that Dave Dickless didn't have a clue as far as radio goes.  If maybe we were allowed up there to make the bumper stickers, go out on sticker stops like we do here,  hand them out, talk about it, get involved with it, send girls out to do it. 
[01:02:00]  You know, then WOW takes off.  When you have a spineless worm with a 70s porno mustache, 70s gay porno mustache, running the station,  then it doesn't take off because he shuts it down.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony timeline.  It's going to end with the ratings that came out yesterday in Boston.  In Boston.  June 1st, 2001.  We're moving fast now.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show is syndicated to Philly.  Ah, Philly. 
[01:02:30]  Philly.  We love Philly.  I want to thank Tim Sabian and WYSP for having the balls to be the first city to syndicate the Opie and Anthony show.  And again, we heard things like, this is not what I am used to.  Right.  We understand.  We know how it works.  The boys realize they will finally be back on in Boston soon.  And can't wait to get their revenge on Dave Dickless, Rock Hole, and the rest of the frauds at WAF.  Took too long. 
[01:03:00]  Took too long.  As soon as we got syndicated, we're like, oh my God, now it's just a matter of time.  Yeah.  Since they're firing, AF spent the next three years living off the success of O&A, pretending  to be the only station that really rocks.  Yeah, right.  It should be noted that Ozone and others that helped get AF on the mat move on to better gigs,  leaving AF looking like a shell of its former self, Anthony.  Right.  A shell of its former self.  When you have people in there.  The station that used to be cool, not cool anymore. 
[01:03:30]  You got people in there that know what they're doing, that get attention on the air, that know  good music, that hang with the artists.  That's going to get you some listeners.  Right?  When they all leave, you're left with Dave Dickless and Rock Hole.  You're done.  You're done.  Look at the book, Dave.  Dave.  Dave.  Are you looking at the book, Dave? 
[01:04:00]  It doesn't look good, does it, Dave?  What are you, Hal?  Open the pod bay doors, Hal.  No, Dave.  All right, we got to take a quick break.  We will wrap up the Opie and Anthony timeline when we get back with the ratings for Boston.  Oh, yeah.  When we get back, August 2001, we get syndicated back to Boston.  Back.  How old are you?  Hey, Steve.  How old are you?  How old are you?  Wow.  Fabulous.  Well.  Holy ravioli. 
[01:04:30]  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're doing something a little different today.  Looking back at some of the events.  A little retrospective, sure, for the radio show.  We're doing the Opie and Anthony timeline.  We're just about done.  It ends with the ratings that came out yesterday for Boston.  It ends with the ratings that came out yesterday for Boston.  So we're up to August 2001, Anthony. 
[01:05:00]  So we're up to August 2001, Anthony.  Roy.  Less than a year ago.  Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony are syndicated back to Boston.  Thank God.  Syndicated back to Boston.  And immediately go about the business of destroying what they built.  Roy.  Roy. 
[01:05:30]  Roy.  Roy.  Rawr! 
[01:06:00]  Seek and destroy!  Yeah!  And destroy!  Seek and destroy!  Bastards!  Hoping Anthony decides...  ...that Dave Dickless and Rockhall will have to pay with their jobs! 
[01:06:30]  Right! We did say that!  We will not rest until they are gone!  Fire! Fire!  Fire!  Dave! 
[01:07:00]  Rockhole!  Dave Dickless had a brilliant strategy, Anthony, when we came to town.  Yes, his battle plan, Opie, his battle plan.  He's got to get his troops ready, especially his afternoon show.  How will they handle the return of the Opie and Anthony show to the Boston Airwaves on the competing station?  Steve's brilliant strategy was...  ...to tell his staff to ignore our attack!  Uh...  To just ignore them!  They will go away!  His battle plan is to do nothing! 
[01:07:30]  To do nothing!  Just keep playing the music and shut your traps!  Right!  No matter what they say, guys!  No matter what happens!  Just ignore it!  Just ignore it!  It'll go away like you ignore a cancerous tumor!  It goes away!  No!  Stupid strategy, Dave!  And now you know what?  Now it's too late!  Now it's too late!  Now if you start fighting, you're just gonna look stupid! 
[01:08:00]  You're exposed as the fraud you are!  Boy, was that stupid!  Right!  Stupid, stupid, stupid!  You're a stupid, stupid man!  Because he's inept!  He's stupid!  He doesn't know how to program against a show like this!  So when they beg and plead...  Rock Hall and the rest of the gang at AAF to at least...  To at least fight back! 
[01:08:30]  To show they have some balls!  To have some pride!  Have a little pride!  And go down swinging at least!  Wear the uniform when you deliver the fish to the boys at IBM!  Have a little pride!  Fight back, you phonies!  What do they do, Anthony?  Nothing!  Even after we told them what would happen if they ignored us?  We spelt it out!  You know, there's nobody that goes into war and spells out to the opponent what they're gonna do to them! 
[01:09:00]  No one does that!  We gave them that!  We told them, we went on the air and said, look, here's how it's gonna go down!  We did!  Like, get on the air and just pummel you!  And unless you fight back, it is guaranteed you will lose!  They'll probably lose even if you fight back!  But at least you're fighting!  Have a little pride!  Make a stand!  Do something!  We spelt it out!  And what did they do?  Nothing! 
[01:09:30]  Listened to Dave Dickless!  You listened and now look at ya!  Now look!  You're exposed!  You're a bunch of phonies!  The only station that really rocks!  Yeah!  Right!  Bye-bye!  Well, Anthony, we finally come to April 23rd, 2002!  That, I do believe, would be...  Wait, let me look at my little watch here for the...  I think that was yesterday!  Yes!  Yesterday, right, eh?  It certainly was yesterday! 
[01:10:00]  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  Yes!  The ratings came out yesterday.  Ratings came out yesterday.  Dave Rocco and company.  How are they doing?  They stink!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha! 
[01:10:30]  We could have saved an hour and a half!  We could have saved an hour and a half.  They stink.  Stink.  It's what I do.  It's all I do.  They are awful.  Awful.  Awful.  They stink.  They stink.  The news, something that AF will not be telling their listeners. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  They probably had, I looked back as far as I could, Anthony.  Anthony, they just had the worst ratings period in at least the last ten years, if not longer.  I can only go back ten years, and I have not been able to see a lower number than what they got yesterday in the ratings.  Right.  So, thank you to the ONA Army for seeing it our way.  Yeah, they...  The only way to see this one.  They had an abomination of a ratings book. 
[01:11:30]  An abomination.  Horrid.  They...  Horrid.  Stink.  Very, very low numbers.  As a matter of fact, I don't remember the numbers being lower.  That's what I said.  Yeah.  I look back over the last ten years.  Ten years.  Because I'm that upset.  You did.  A ten-year low.  I did a ten-year study.  It might even be longer, but you couldn't go back any further?  I went back to like 91, 92.  Oh, my God.  And the station has never been lower. 
[01:12:00]  This could be the worst ratings ever.  Ever.  I don't want to say for sure, because I don't have the info, but...  Right.  It could very well be the worst ratings ever for that station.  And let me just put it in terms you could understand.  Find people of Boston.  Yes.  Yes.  Out of all the radios that are on right now, right now listening to radio, and all those  cars, look around, see all the cars?  Yeah.  They all have radios in them.  Okay?  Yeah.  Maybe you're at a park and there's a few radios on, or maybe you're at a job and there's 
[01:12:30]  a radio on, okay?  All the radios that are on right this second, less than 2% of them, less than 2% of them  are listening to our old radio station.  Less than 2.  Less than 2%.  Bye-bye.  It gets uglier when you start talking about individual shows.  Yeah.  How is our buddy Rock Hole doing in afternoons?  I saw a huge drop-off, and where it used to be this horse race between the station we're 
[01:13:00]  on and Rock Hole, now it is not even close.  It's ridiculous.  It's so ridiculous that I hate to say this, we're pretty much going to have to move on.  There's no fight here anymore.  Oh, but you know, there's no fight.  But it's fun when Rock Hole calls us.  I love when Rock Hole calls us.  He certainly can call from time to time.  Hey, guys.  And we will be paying attention, and we will look forward to the day that Dave is shown 
[01:13:30]  the door, which will happen soon, mark my words.  Oh, yeah.  No company will allow their radio station.  Oh, wait.  They're allowing that in New York.  Hmm, interesting.  How does that work?  Geez.  Then it could take a while.  Dave's in trouble.  It's really obvious.  And Rock Hole is in deep ass.  Yep.  It's over, Johnny.  It is over.  Bye-bye.  Back to Nebraska.  It is over.  With you. 
[01:14:00]  Jack off.  We did very well.  Very well in Boston.  Number one in all the mail demos once again, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  So I want to thank the O&A Army.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And doing very good in even the ones that we don't care about.  Right.  It's just doing great across the board.  Yes.  And I think we're going to be doing something at the Sam Adams Brewery to celebrate.  Oh.  Details coming when we figure it all out.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So there you have it.  There you go.  Thank you, Boston, for giving us what we wanted. 
[01:14:30]  A little bit of revenge.  A dish that's best served cold.  And, Captain Kirk, it is cold in space.  Gone!  Yes.  And, of course, you know, just because we really concentrated on Boston doesn't mean that Washington  and Cleveland.  Cleveland's ridiculous. 
[01:15:00]  I want to say it.  Cleveland.  Guys, you've got to get some kind of life outside of this show.  You know what?  You guys, apparently, they're just listening to this program in Cleveland.  Yeah.  That's great.  Why don't we do this?  So Cleveland and D.C., you know, so it doesn't sound like we're just tossing it aside.  Right.  We'll take a little break here.  We'll regroup and we'll give you the ratings for Washington, D.C. and Cleveland, D.C.  But there you have it.  Uh-huh.  Thank you, Boston.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:15:30]  Thank you.  Do you have the ratings for Rochester?  Because I'll be there May 18th.  Oh, God, you're despicable.  Scorch, what's going on?  Hey, man.  You suppose Dave Dickless will now be looking for pizza as opposed to hamburgers?  Ah, perhaps now you can get your job back there, Scorch.  I don't want my job back.  Hey, welcome to my family, guys.  What are you talking about?  You are now on an Albany at a station owned by the same people that own my station.  Hey, Scorch.  You're going to do extremely well there.  Good to you. 
[01:16:00]  I'm glad for you.  I'm very happy.  We're going to have fun with Albany.  Yeah, Albany is actually...  We're in day three of the Albany experiment, and we're just giving them a face full of  crap so far.  Yeah.  Don't worry, Albany.  But I just wanted to call up and say hey, and congrats for keeping on going.  You guys are...  All right.  You guys are rocking.  Thank you, Scorch.  And you rock serious.  Yes, I do.  Thanks.  Scorch1.com, by the way.  Let me give myself a plug.  Scorch1.com.  Scorch1.com.  Check it out.  Kingdom of Niggas.  Yeah, do check it out.  What's going on, guys? 
[01:16:30]  Long time no hear from.  What's going on?  Did you go see The Legend last night, sir?  What's up?  Did you go see Dice last night?  He was in Syracuse.  Oh, no, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  No.  Syracuse is...  Well, that's kind of close, yeah.  We're going to have Dice on the show today.  Scorch, we've got to let you go because we've got to take a quick break.  Yeah, we've got to go to...  If you want to call back later, we'd love to talk to you.  Cool, man.  All right.  You guys.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  What?  Oh, God.  I love that guy.  I can never hear that enough.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, and...  All right. 
[01:17:00]  So we'll take a break.  We'll regroup.  And we'll pretty much start today's Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  I hope you enjoyed the timeline.  We had a lot of fun putting that together.  Yes.  Actually, like, preparing for a show.  It was kind of interesting.  Never do that again.  We had notes and cues and all sorts of stuff going on there.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, including Cleveland, Washington, D.C., and, of course, Boston. 
[01:17:30]  866-277-4WOW.  Opie and Anthony.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breaths.  Boobs.  Wow.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Ratings are coming in for all the cities, so you've got to bear with us. 
[01:18:00]  Really fast, the rundown thus far.  Yeah.  Ratings came in for New York.  We're still number one.  Men 18 of 49, the reason we were hired to do this radio show.  But the ratings weren't that great.  I'm not going to lie to you.  We've seen much better here in New York, but we're still number one, so number one is still number one, I guess.  Right.  But we weren't completely stoked about the ratings in New York City.  No.  Not at all. 
[01:18:30]  Then Philly came in, Anthony, and we destroyed.  Oh, yeah.  Destroyed in Philly.  Someone was telling me the highest ratings in Afternoon Drive for WYSP ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Number one in every male demo, Tim Sabian was telling us the other day.  And by a long shot, like no one's even close.  Yeah.  Ridiculous numbers.  Thank you so much, Philly.  Let's just put it this way.  In New York, they're starting to get close.  They're starting to get close.  Hello?  Hello?  They're starting to get close.  Hello? 
[01:19:00]  But Philly, we just destroyed in Philly.  We just gave you the hour and a half rundown of the Boston thing.  Oh, and this station goes all polka.  Perhaps that'll boost our numbers a little bit.  There you go.  Boston, once again, number one, men, 18 of 49.  The reason why we're doing this radio show.  Don't forget that.  Number one in just about all the male demos, I believe.  I don't have them in front of me, but doing very, very well.  No complaints in Boston.  Yeah.  New York, hello?  Hello? 
[01:19:30]  Hello?  Hello?  You're freaking us out a little bit.  Hello?  You out there?  Hello?  Right.  Hello?  Ding dong.  Stop freaking us out.  Hello?  Tell a friend.  Get that wow stick on your car.  Hello?  Where are you from?  We're all pals, right?  Yeah.  What happened?  Hello, New York?  New York.  Hi.  New York, are you here?  Everyone else is here.  Boston, Philly, D.C., Cleveland. 
[01:20:00]  Wow, look at how many people from Cleveland are here.  Hello?  Right.  Hello?  Oh, someone new is in here.  Are they from New York?  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Hello?  Anyway.  New York.  So, Boston, no complaints.  Philly, no complaints.  New York, we're a little nervous.  What are you doing?  A little bit, a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  All right.  Well, then the ratings for Cleveland came out yesterday afternoon, Anthony. 
[01:20:30]  Yes.  And the only way, I don't even know how to describe the ratings for Cleveland.  Ridiculous.  I guess you could say, holy S. They're insane.  Holy S.  It's almost as if somebody may have made a mathematical error when they added them up.  Right.  And didn't catch it.  That's how stupid, ridiculous they are.  We got like a, I'm hearing a 25 share.  Men 18 and 34.  That's just ridiculous.  Men 18 and 34.  Holy Toledo.  Basically, guys in Cleveland would rather listen to our show than get laid. 
[01:21:00]  No, they wouldn't.  Yes, they would.  It's amazing.  Hey, man.  It's just a joke.  Relax.  I think it's easier to count the people that aren't listening to the show.  Everyone said we were blown up in Cleveland.  Well, we got proof now.  Goddamn love you, Cleveland.  Ridiculous proof.  And for the first time, Anthony, the reason we do this radio show, let's not forget, is  Men 18 and 49.  Yes.  That is it.  I mean, if you read our contracts, that's what you'll see.  Who has time to read that horse crap? 
[01:21:30]  To get them to listen or date them?  What are you talking about?  What's important to us?  Who has?  Men 18 and 49.  Well, they start losing the abs at 50.  Don't think, Eric.  Who has time to read our contracts?  Right.  200 pages of horse ass.  It's all bull crap.  Promise things that don't happen.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Whatever.  We're cool with it.  Relax.  Stop making your phone calls.  We're fine. 
[01:22:00]  Everything's fine.  I want it to.  So Cleveland, ridiculous.  And for the first time, Anthony, in Cleveland, men 18 and 49, number one for the first time.  Right.  By far, by the way.  By far.  Thank you, Cleveland.  Finally, this morning, Washington, D.C. the ratings came in.  Washington.  Now, if you recall.  Yeah, you want to, like, set up the Washington situation.  Washington, very tricky situation.  A little bit.  A little bit.  In the nation's capital. 
[01:22:30]  A little bit.  A little bit.  We went into the slot that was held by Don and Mike in Washington, D.C. for many years.  As far as Washington goes, there was no reason to remove them from their spot.  No.  Oh, they had huge ratings.  Number one.  And it was ridiculous, their ratings.  Very good.  Number one.  And then, in order to get people on other stations and whatnot, some time, some of the day parts were shifted around. 
[01:23:00]  We had to do some shuffling.  Some shuffling, as they say.  For them to be live in New York, for us to be live in D.C.  They went to middays.  We took afternoons in D.C.  And we took a face full of ass from everybody.  People were so pissed off.  Everybody.  Oh, my God.  Washington hated us.  Everybody hates us.  See, most of the times, this program is put in a station in a city that is doing either well, you know, okay, or just in a crappy situation. 
[01:23:30]  And we are there to bring it up out of the toilet or whatever.  However, the slot we took in D.C. was highly rated.  And we stepped in and just erased all of those ratings.  We chased away everybody that was listening from 3 to 7 in Washington, D.C.  Remember the quote from Ken Stevens.  Do you remember it exactly?  Ah! 
[01:24:00]  That one?  He's never seen more of a bigger ratings disaster.  A bigger ratings disaster.  Ratings disaster.  In the history of his career.  We went in and pretty much just alienated everyone from the 3 to 7 slot at WJFK in D.C.  Everyone.  That was it.  All right.  Before we give you the ratings in D.C., Eric from Philly with a very funny instant feedback, Anthony.  Can you guys do the Washington timeline?  Yeah, he does it.  Oh, he does?  Yeah.  September 2001. 
[01:24:30]  Crickets chirping.  Crickets chirping.  Yeah.  Okay.  October 2001.  Crickets chirping.  November 2001.  Crickets chirping.  December 2001.  You guessed it.  Crickets chirping.  January 2002.  Someone coughs.  Followed by crickets chirping.  February 2002.  Lady writes in saying O&A will never last and Stephanie shows her awesome can.  Oh.  March 2002. 
[01:25:00]  People realize their cars are equipped with radios.  April 2002.  O&A rule Washington.  There you go.  Well, at least someone is listening.  He finishes.  Well, we're not ruling Washington.  No, it's a slow climb out.  Actually, it's working out pretty well.  Yes.  We are proud to announce.  Remember, we're all about men 18 and 49.  Hey, we love when the ladies listen.  We love when the younger men listen. 
[01:25:30]  We love when the older men listen.  Matter of fact, in a lot of these cities, we're number one men across the board from 12  all the way up to 54, Anthony.  Right.  But as you focus in what we're all about, it's men 18 and 49.  Anyone from the company will tell you that.  Washington, D.C., men 18 and 49, the O.P. and Anthony show, number one.  Number FN one.  Bravo.  Number one.  Thank you, Washington, D.C.  Number one.  Look at that. 
[01:26:00]  And going up everywhere.  Still got some work to do.  Of course we do.  As far as overall listenership, it was such a disaster that we still have work to do.  So, oh, my God, what a disaster that was.  But now D.C. coming aboard.  Number one.  Number one.  18 and 49, Washington, D.C.  Look it up for yourself, all you N.C.  There you go.  All you people that want to rip into the show.  Look it up.  It's there for your viewing pleasure.  People listening.  D.C. and Cleveland and, of course, Boston. 
[01:26:30]  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you, New York.  All right.  Come on, New York.  Huh?  I'd like to compliment the Pope.  What?  Just on the old front page of the Daily News, it was just a very poignant Pope on priest  pedophilia.  It's a crime.  That's what the Pope said, and I just wanted to say that he doesn't miss anything. 
[01:27:00]  That Pope is right on top of things.  He's sharp in his old age.  He also came out and said that shack is tall and the earth is round.  Pope is on fire with the poignant statements.  The Pope on his hat.  It's pointing.  Wow.  81 years old.  He's still sharp as a tack, isn't he?  Boy, oh, boy.  Only 40,000 duck-walking little fellas, and he decides to speak up and say it's a crime.  Duck-walking little fellas. 
[01:27:30]  Wah, wah.  Ow.  I've got to sleep on my tummy.  Did you see how they gave a description of Crinkle Crinkle in one of the shows that  was on Comedy Central the other day?  What do you mean?  It's some show where some guy takes challenges.  One of those challenges.  Oh, the tourist show?  Yeah.  The tourist Stinky Notes.  He had to spank it in the same bathroom that George Michael spanked it in.  Oh, he tried to pick up guys in that bathroom.  What was he doing, Stinky?  It's called Travel Sick. 
[01:28:00]  Travel Sick.  And he had to try to get a guy to bang him in George Michael's bathroom.  To have sex with him?  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  So he's getting on him saying, you know, I like apples and oranges.  Oh, so that it goes both ways.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  So what about Crinkle Crinkle?  And then they actually described how that was done.  He said he took out a bag, a shopping bag, and he put it on the floor, and he made the  guy step into it, and he goes, like he was sitting on the bowl.  The guy is standing with his butt facing him. 
[01:28:30]  And he goes, now you stand in the bag.  Now you can sit on my lap, and they can go to town that way.  And if a cop or somebody looks underneath the stall, all he sees is a guy sitting on  the bowl.  Maybe he's done some shopping.  So he's got the bag in front of him.  No one knows that the feet of a young lad could be in there or something.  And there's some gay sex going on.  Comedy Central won't give me a special, and yet they find that and be, oh, hey.  Wait a minute, Norton.  I understand you're a little angry with Comedy Central.  No, I'm not even angry with them. 
[01:29:00]  I've done some things with them, and it's terrific.  They edit you a little much.  They don't let you hit on some of your more blue material, as they would put it.  But they describe crinkle crinkle pretty well, and gay, man, backdoor action, sex in the  bathroom.  Yeah.  But you can't...  No, no.  Don't do my...  The thing about the deformed girl and banging her for 50 bucks or a hair lip or a burn victim.  Don't do that line, because it might offend deformed people.  But if you're a cartoon, hey, you talk like that, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:29:30]  Boy, that cartoon is hilarious.  I don't watch it.  It's overrated, and it sucks.  Not a big South Park fan.  No, it's overrated.  I got some of your lines in the South Park show, though, bro.  Fuck it.  You know why it's a hit?  Because it's the only pseudo-edgy thing on television, and they're not real people, you  dopes.  Let a real person say it, and then you got balls.  Yeah.  They will not allow you to go on stage during a special and say the same type of material. 
[01:30:00]  Special?  What is that?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Where you do it for more than four minutes?  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Oh, God damn.  Oh, I'm really annoyed.  Oh, he's very angry.  Yeah, I just, uh, I hope no one calls me a chicken, bud, because then I'll have to sue.  What a stupid voice.  They come up with some real good lines for this show, though.  This is one of my favorites.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  Oh.  Well, somebody put this retard out of his misery. 
[01:30:30]  Hot lunch?  Can you not make fun of, uh, you know, you can't make fun, I couldn't do the prosthetic  line, because it might offend people with prosthetic.  Are you kidding?  Oh, no, I'm not kidding.  Watch the table.  You can't even talk about prosthetics?  I have the original, uncut.  Yeah.  Uh, and I have the edited version, and it just makes me want to vomit.  Oh.  All right.  Let's, uh, let's go to the phone.  It's very angry.  I don't mind.  I will kick you in my neck!  Yeah, all right.  Now, the reason I mentioned, should I just mention this real quick, because this made 
[01:31:00]  me really, really want to put someone's face into a toilet.  The suit over the, we can call it chicken butt.  Chicken butt.  Uh, uh, Jennifer Seelig sued, or whatever station, in San Francisco, after Vincent Crackhorn  of the Sarah and Vinny morning show.  How awful must that be?  I'm Sarah, and I'm Vinny, and we stink!  Like, called her, because she had an audition for like, who wants to be, who wants to marry  a millionaire? 
[01:31:30]  Who wants to marry a millionaire.  So I guess calling her a C would have been the more appropriate thing.  And, uh, they called her a local loser and a chicken butt.  Are you kidding?  And she sued for, um, I don't know how much money...  Are you kidding?  Like a listener goes down, and they call her a chicken butt, and she sues?  Yeah, she...  Wow, don't set that precedent.  2000 Fox contestant on Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.  And they called her a chicken butt, which shows you how awful that show is.  Hey, chicken butt. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, Sarah, do you think she's a chicken butt?  She's a local loser, Vinny.  Hey, don't elbow that.  It's my uterus.  Guy and a gal, you know, getting everybody listening and laughing.  Tussling each other's hair.  Waking you up in the morning with a little chicken butt madcap humor.  Playing battle of the sexes, everyone.  I'll bet you she didn't marry that millionaire because she had a chicken butt.  Hubba, hubba.  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  Let me hold my ribs.  Chicken butt? 
[01:32:30]  That stinks.  That's only funny if you're talking about, like, an Ethiopian.  Look at him.  He's got a chicken butt.  You know?  Why?  Because it's, like, skinny?  No, no, no, because there's flies on it.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Flies on people jokes, always funny.  Don't say it on Comedy Central, though.  Oh, no.  Because they might eat people with flies, let's see.  And they might get offended.  Bill from D.C., what's up?  I hate people with flies.  Since the ratings are up in D.C., I was wondering if you were going to come to the Norton show on the fence. 
[01:33:00]  Ah, we will be broadcasting live down there in D.C.  Very good.  Yes, we will.  Very good.  That is a guarantee, so we're hoping a lot of people will show up at the station when we're there.  And, uh, you're going to be at JFK?  Hell, yeah.  All right.  We feel like we can at least, um, show our faces.  Just show them, say, hey, hey, what's going on?  You know?  Mugs.  See what it's all about?  Perfect.  Very good.  Yeah, well, D.C.  Jordan, you're old.  Thank you, sir.  Bill will definitely be down there.  There you go.  We're coming down. 
[01:33:30]  Opera Mary wants in on the show.  Opera Mary, I've got to explain.  And I decided to do this Opie and Anthony timeline, and we didn't want any distractions or anything.  And we forgot that Opera Mary is doing a WOW sticker stop here in New York.  No, I'm wearing a jersey.  Get a hold of yourself there.  Relax.  Wow.  This is a test of joy.  Wow.  New Jersey.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  We're in Jersey.  All right.  Relax, dude.  All right.  I'm relaxed.  Chill. 
[01:34:00]  I'm excited.  How's that?  All right.  So, uh, she's out.  Where are you in Jersey?  I don't even know.  We're on the northbound side of Route 17, right at the Paramus Auto Mall.  We're right in front.  You cannot miss us.  Hello?  Yes, yes.  Listening.  I thought you hung up on me.  No, no, no.  This is very important.  Yes, it is.  We are on the northbound side.  So, make sure that it's Route 17.  In New Jersey.  The Paramus Auto Mall.  It's actually really nice out here.  Uh, the staff is nice. 
[01:34:30]  So, come and visit us.  We'll be here for another 20, 25 minutes.  Yeah.  They've been there for two hours.  No one has shown up because no one knows they're there today.  Because we were supposed to, uh, promote it on our show.  Thanks.  Uh, so guys, if you're in the area, stop by, say hi to Opera Mary and the gang, and get  your, uh, wow stickers, okay?  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Opera Mary.  Goodbye, Opie.  Good day.  Oh, God.  You didn't get it, dude.  She still hasn't sang any opera for us in here.  That chicken butt.  A little stanza.  Oh, chicken butt. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Uh, Rock, Rock Hole.  Hello?  Hey, Rock Hole, what's up?  I'm sorry.  Don't be.  Yes, Rock Hole?  Cheer up, Rock Hole.  Cheer up.  You still got Dave.  Yeah, and I'm sure when you get fired, you'll get an opportunity in New York City, just like  we did.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Think?  Things are looking up for you.  We're coming back. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  I got new ideas.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  What are you going to do, some good fake radio?  I'll call it.  All right.  You want to tell the truth?  Yeah.  You know the Jamaica thing?  It's really just Dave's office, a kiddie pool, and we dump some sand.  Is that what your Jamaica trip is?  Yeah.  That was supposed to bring back the ratings, I think.  Yeah, that's like one of those things that are supposed to boost your ratings, Rock Hole.  How do you think they're so low?  We were found out.  That's some smart thinking.  Your afternoon drive show stinks so bad, Dickless decides, hey, time for a vacation. 
[01:36:00]  Go to Jamaica.  We'll send them to Jamaica.  You know, I can't even take my shirt off to go in the pool.  You know, Rock Hole?  Because I got those huge man boobs.  Awful.  I'm so embarrassed.  Yeah.  And Matty's got such a little chicken butt.  It's just...  Oh, my God.  You shouldn't say chicken butt.  It's edgy radio.  I'm coming back.  It's edgy radio.  Yeah, you and your edgy radio. 
[01:36:30]  You are coming back, though.  Woo!  Sure I'm following a bucket of AIDS.  Yeah, sure looks like you're coming back there, Rock Hole.  That's mine, too.  All right.  All right, Rock Hole.  Thank you, Rock Hole.  Yeah, thank you.  All right.  There he goes.  I hope he didn't spend that bonus.  By the way, can I say how nice it is?  I think that three women are pregnant with clones in Italy.  And can I say, finally...  You like this?  No.  I love it.  Really?  Yeah.  Fat and awful looking people.  Bye-bye.  Your time on this planet is short-lived. 
[01:37:00]  You think this is going to work?  Yeah.  No.  Now they're going to find out that it's...  It don't work.  Something is a little screwy with the cloning.  Well, you know what else something was screwy with?  The first time the Wright brothers got in that little plane and flew 20 feet.  And now look at us, zipping all over the place.  So they're going to like...  I do believe they also died in air crashes.  You know what?  All right.  So, hey, look.  How many Pam Andersons can you have?  As many as you need.  Right.  That's the beauty of cloning.  I think this cloning thing is going to be a little wacky and a little kooky at first. 
[01:37:30]  A little tricky?  Well, I won't affect Maury's show.  I mean, that's all it does.  You're going to have zeros that are going to be, like, squeezed out yet.  You're going to have people, their eyes are going to be a little cross-eyed a little bit.  Yeah.  You know what I think it's going to be like?  You ever see those books that come out every so often?  Hey, make your own Twinkies at home.  And it's got the ingredients on how to make a Twinkie.  Or make your own Big Mac at home.  And you cook it, and the ingredients are there.  And everything's exactly the same as they make at Hostess or McDonald's, or when you're making your own yodel at home, or whatever the hell it is. 
[01:38:00]  And what happens?  It ain't quite right, is it?  No, but that's the beauty of it.  What?  One of those little Twinkies.  It doesn't taste quite as good.  But I'll tell you, if you hold it and you warm it and you put your mule there, you can't tell the difference.  That's the beauty of it.  Maybe it's not tasty, but darn it, it feels good when you get dumped again.  You're condoning effing freak clones?  That's why they should be made.  All you've got to do is just make a girl who all she can say is,  I have to tinkle, and sure, I'll suck that. 
[01:38:30]  And she cries and goes, thank you.  That's why I'm more of a cloning.  Do you want to vote?  No.  That's all she wants to do, and that and tongue your balloon nut.  Do you think they would be second-class citizens?  Is there a way to make one so you can just have one as a servant or a sex slave?  Yeah, go down south and meet any girl.  That's what it's about.  They're raised proper down there.  Buy them from their parents for a few shiny pieces. 
[01:39:00]  I love the cloning.  I'm all for the cloning.  I'm all for it.  I think like Ope says, though, they're going to come out a little funny and a little silly.  I agree.  That's why you keep the trouble.  A little off.  A little off.  They're going to get some of those diseases that we've kind of cured already.  Yeah, we kind of cured, make up some new ones.  Also, we're like, wait a minute, didn't we cure that?  Something's going to happen.  Hey, maybe the church can get in on this, and you can make little fella clones that don't testify.  How would that be?  Look, no duck walking. 
[01:39:30]  The possibilities are endless.  I think it's going to be more like, you know, if you try to clone Patrick Swayze, you get Patrick Swayze's brother.  Oh, boy.  Just a little off.  It's like Patrick Swayze.  You could tell, you know, they're from the same line, but it's just a little off.  Just a little off.  Like Tom, you want to clone Tom Hanks, you get his brother.  You get Tom Hanks' brother.  Oh, boy.  Well, it almost looks like Tom Hanks if he was retarded.  I tuned in out of my peripheral vision.  I thought I saw Tom Hanks on the TV.  But then when I turned, I went, oh, wait a minute. 
[01:40:00]  Well, he did the running scene in Gump.  That was Hanks' brother.  Oh, was it?  You know, how about that?  We have talked about this on our show many times.  We have this observation.  You see the celebrity brothers on a lot of these talk shows from time to time.  And you know what?  If you're the brother of someone famous, you can't help but looking like that famous person  if they were retarded.  Right.  A little off.  A little off.  A little silly.  It sucks to be the brother or the sister of someone famous.  And it wouldn't be murder.  Let's just say you have a little clone and he's acting up. 
[01:40:30]  Ah, you kill him.  Is that all?  Yeah, you take a little DNA and start over.  Well, a lot of people saying maybe you could clone yourself and then you freeze them.  You need one of these organs or something.  There you go.  You got one.  Logan's run had a point.  Eventually, we will be euthanizing people at a certain age because disease will be eradicated.  But how great would that be?  Cry, cry.  Ah, shake, shake.  Whoops.  He quit breathing.  Marge, get another one out of there.  Get another one out of the closet.  Yeah, or out of your box.  Whatever you keep, the little fellas. 
[01:41:00]  But if you need a heart or a liver transplant or something.  Yeah, exactly.  What would stop you?  Let's say right when you're born, they clone you, right?  Now, your clone gets to grow up, but in a farm environment.  Not in this human thing where you, you know, contact with other humans so they fall in love or something.  That's how it's got to be done because you can't clone someone already grown up.  It's probably like veals.  Right.  Kind of like the livers.  You grow them to the age where you can harvest organs. 
[01:41:30]  Then they are frozen or somehow kept where the organs will be okay.  Then if you need an organ later in life, you have a nice, young, healthy organ.  Then there's the, hmm.  I'm completely pulling any morality out of this.  Yeah, because then there is the question about, well, what if they have a soul?  I mean, I don't know about, I don't know about radio.  Oh, they will have a soul.  Oh, they will have a soul.  Well, you know what you could do?  You can't do that.  Right when they're born or right when you clone them and the clone is then born, you take out the part of their brain. 
[01:42:00]  You make them a vegetable, but you let their organs keep growing in the body.  And then maybe then Will Sampson can shake them and smother them with a pillow and throw the sink through the window.  How does that go?  I can't leave you like this.  I'm taking you with me.  You bloody baboon, you've cut out his brain.  You know, something like that where then he wouldn't have to think and fall in love and grow up and get educated.  It would just be a life support system for completely compatible organs for you. 
[01:42:30]  Mac, are you going to say goodbye to me, Mac?  Settle down, Charles.  I'm not talking about my wife.  I'm talking about my life.  God, the devil, heaven, hell.  Do you understand?  Settle down.  Finally, please.  But sometimes you gang up on me.  Please.  What?  Samantha.  Yes.  What are you talking about?  What about Ron and Fez?  Oh, no, no.  Did you listen to them last night through the Osbournes?  I know it has absolutely nothing to do with what you're talking about.  No, I don't know why.  Okay, if you could clone somebody, wouldn't you think Ron Howard would clone his ugly brother? 
[01:43:00]  Who, Clint Howard?  Yes.  Yeah, when you look at Clint...  No, Clint Howard is so far gone, like it isn't even near Ron Howard.  That's cloning gone bad.  And then you just think of him as the kid on Star Trek.  Right.  Ha, ha, ha.  We are a lot alike, Captain Kirk.  Have some tranya.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Look at my ship, Captain.  We both love our ships.  Remember the little kid?  You don't watch Star Trek.  I was never a Trek fan.  Sorry.  You were never a nothing fan. 
[01:43:30]  I was busy looking at Marilyn Chambers videos.  I really didn't care what Leonard Nimoy, or is it Lemoy, was doing when he wasn't hosting  Awful in Search of, which accomplished nothing.  I loved in Search of.  Yeah, so did everyone in the 70s.  I love the Loch Ness Monster episode.  And it was a fraud, you dopes out there.  The surgeon admitted his photo was a fraud.  The most famous photo of Nessie.  He did?  Yes, he did on his deathbed.  He admitted it was a fraud.  Well, that's just to throw everyone off.  No, that was the most famous photo.  Wouldn't you pull the ultimate gag on your deathbed?  I like the guys that strap the big Bigfoot feet on and walk in the woods. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Make the footprints.  But the worst part is you see those big feet, and you're like, oh, I've got to grab  that seat, because it's got to...  And then you're like, oh, you...  I bet it's tasty and big.  Yeah.  Hey, is Dice coming in here today?  Yeah.  All right, well, we've got to take a break.  I used to do an awful bit on the Bigfoot, and if anything they say about the size of  a fellow's feet, it was a bit...  Wait, wait, wait.  Speaking of which, you promised that you'd bring in your first...  I got to find the tape.  I know.  He's got a tape of his first few months of doing comedy.  Six months. 
[01:44:30]  It's only...  It was a Bud Light competition.  Yeah.  And I do have it somewhere.  It's only like three minutes.  It was from Fox.  They only taped three...  It wasn't like he was a rascal.  I was horrendous.  Really?  You've got to bring that tape in.  I will.  We're going to do a show where everyone brings in their embarrassing tapes.  Oh, I got some.  And I got one from 93.  Rick brought his in today.  Rick brought a videotape, and unfortunately...  Hey, can we take a break, and then we'll explain Rick's embarrassing tape?  It's great.  And you've got to bring in your tape?  I have a couple.  They're terrible.  I have a tape of me with my band As Is doing a love ballad. 
[01:45:00]  It is horrendous.  Horrendous.  As is?  Yeah.  A-Z-I-Z.  As is?  Well, Arizona is?  No, no, no, no.  Sorry.  As is.  Stop it.  We all have those.  Shut up.  We all do.  I want to hear your awful comedy.  Dude, it's brutal.  What do you have, Opie?  I got my XFL tapes.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know. 
[01:45:30]  I would have to think about it.  You would have to break out a really embarrassing break that you did on radio.  Well, that's it.  Do you have any Spuds Buckley?  Yeah, I got that.  Bring in Spuds Buckley.  Come on.  That's like the Dorton laughing.  We all bring in one completely embarrassing audio tape of us.  Do that.  Come on.  Let's work on that.  Shut up, Jim.  Douchebag.  Spuds Buckley.  There wasn't anyone around during my time to just take me under his wing and put me on  a great radio show.  Absolutely.  I had to do it myself.  I'm Kenny Credit Giver. 
[01:46:00]  I realize.  Believe it.  You think I don't know that I'm just like this two co-cales and I happen to grab onto them?  I'm the first one to admit that and then look at myself in the mirror and go, aha, lucky.  You think Anthony lucked out?  Jesus.  I know.  He has seven years of work to do to pave the way for meaty breasts.  And I've worked at this for seven years and we just.  We just tossed you a little bone.  There you go.  Just a little one.  And I think you guys and I love you both so much.  Every time there's a head going blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm like, those guys are really good friends.  All right. 
[01:46:30]  We'll go to the F.U. line.  We'll talk about Rick's embarrassing tape.  I never know about this.  Rick, do you at least have the audio?  Where's Rick?  Tell him to get the audio of the actual people in the scene talking about where they are.  Yeah.  Rick, get the audio.  He'll get the audio and then we'll kind of fill in the pictures for you.  Right.  But first, it's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the O.P.  Anthony F.U. line.  Hey, I'd like to leave the big F.U.  The idiot's the show last night who had to repeat the punchline of every single joke. 
[01:47:00]  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big F.U.  Going out to the protesters in Washington, D.C.  Who are blocking the f.ing.  Intersection.  I need to go to Motorhead tonight.  They're blocking the friggin' intersection.  F.U.  Protesters.  Next message.  Hey, this is a big F.U.  to MTV for not playing a damn thing about Lane Staley from Alice in Chains dying on Ford  Plenty.  F.U.  Next message. 
[01:47:30]  This is a big F.U.  F.U.  to everybody in Seattle and Portland.  Every time any of you call O.P.  Anthony, you f***ing talk about how it's raining, nobody f***ing cares that it's raining, nobody  cares, everybody already knows, shut the f*** up about the weather already, nobody cares.

[01:48:00]  F.U.  F.U.  Let them hang like the animals they are.  F.U.  F.U.  F.U.  We'll be an Anthony show on 027-2-2-1-A-W.  We'll swing this show to a home.  Oh, it's freezing home.  I don't know.  We'll whip them out Wednesday.  We'll whip them out Wednesday.  We'll whip them out Wednesday.  We'll whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, this is fantastic.  It's beautiful.  We'll whip them out Wednesday.  We'll whip them out Wednesday. 
[01:48:30]  We're killing you, crazy.  Those are real.  Wow, that's real.  How about the woman who's in the head on?  Ah, yeah.  Sexy.  Sexy.  You have sorry.  Wow.  We'll show you.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, yes.  You just got wowed.  Wow.  That was amazing.  That's nice.  We'll be an Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  It's whirlwind in an hour.  We'll whip them out Wednesday.  We'll whip them out Wednesday. 
[01:49:00]  We'll whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  People are important.  Okay.  It's whip them out Wednesday.  It's whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah, it's whip them out Wednesday.  Ah, wow.  It's a surprise.  Ah, wow.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yes, it's whip them out Wednesday.  All right.  Why don't we have a girl here wowing for us today?  It doesn't make sense. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, we had Gloria in the other day.  Yeah, that was a treat.  I was checking out the video and the pictures up on soundrymusic.com.  Very good.  Stunning.  Ah, smoke on.  Yeah, wow is definitely taking off here in New York.  I would have to say, better than last year at this time, Anthony.  Yes.  Every week you're seeing more and more wows on the highways and the byways and at the construction  sites and on the side of buildings and wherever you can display it.  Thanks for the support as far as wow goes.  It supports the show and it also gives you a chance to see a girl topless. 
[01:50:00]  Yes.  Girls do this every single day for the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's basically whip them out whenever at this point.  Right, Ann?  They search for guys with a wow on their vehicle.  They're looking.  We've gotten calls from girls that say, look, I'm willing to wow, but I know you guys don't  want me showing my cans to anybody unless they got a wow on their vehicle.  Yeah, that's absolutely right.  And what guy in their right mind isn't going to put a wow somewhere?  Maybe you got a wife who's a little bit of a stick in the mud or a C, however you want 
[01:50:30]  to put it.  You know what?  You don't have to put a C.  There's a lot of mileage between a stick in the mud and a C.  There's a lot to cover there, but we all know what I mean.  There's got to be a few adjectives in between stick in the mud and C.  Not really, no.  No, that's it.  Stick in your C.  I like that.  All right, don't be a stick in the C.  There's no gray area.  It's either black or white.  None.  The gray area is taint.  And it better not be gray.  Pew! 
[01:51:00]  It was beautifully marbled meat, man.  It was turning gray.  And through all that taint, I'm sauciate.  So what about this wife that might be a stick in the mud?  Maybe, because we've heard from guys, poor henpeck guys.  They're beaten down and broken by their women.  And they say, you know, I can't put a wow on my vehicle because the old lady's going to  give me crap about it if she sees it.  The old whore band.  The old slut rag chicken butt.  Oh, hey. 
[01:51:30]  Now I've gone comedy too far.  I've gone too far.  Well, you know what?  This small...  The old hot thin piece of ass that used to hob your knob.  Oh, maybe you just need a little wow somewhere.  Somewhere in the back window of your car.  Something you can grab maybe and throw in the garbage for that week before you drive home.  Before you pull up in your garage.  Yeah, the wow stickers are disposable if you have to use them that way.  Yeah, whatever.  Put it on your car for the ride home.  And just before you drive up to the nightmare that is your marriage and your marriage and 
[01:52:00]  your children.  Put it in your pocket.  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of just...  Oh, no.  Don't put it in the pocket.  You might find it there.  You toss it out the window.  What's this?  A wow sticker?  She freaks out on you.  You tell her you confiscated it from someone and you were going to bring it to the police.  Exactly.  Kind of like the same thing you do with those escort numbers.  Just before you get home, you've got to throw them away.  Yeah, you throw them out the window.  Maybe a little lipstick on your collar. 
[01:52:30]  You throw the shirt away.  Say you had an accident at work.  Yeah.  Go get another one.  A little oil on there.  That's why you ran out to the store to buy a new t-shirt.  Jesus.  Drive home to that nightmare.  Get the little fold marks in the sleeve of your t-shirt.  That's how you know your husband is cheating.  If every day he comes home with a t-shirt with little fold marks down the middle and in the sleeves.  A little fold mark.  Don't ruin it for the guys out there.  Perfectly folded.  That are just trying to get by. 
[01:53:00]  Well, that's what you've got to do.  You've got guys that can't afford a divorce and just have to...  No one can afford a divorce.  With that smile on their face as they pull into the driveway every night.  Good to see you.  Anyway.  Where were we?  Disgusting.  I had to bring up a story, though, that I've got to tell.  Back in my younger days.  Back in my younger days, Hopi.  Oh.  I was seeing a girl, girlfriend, and I was cheating. 
[01:53:30]  I was cheating on her.  I finally decided...  You were cheating.  Make the jump and cheat.  You, Anthony, were cheating.  Yes, I was.  I finally decided to plunge right in and cheat on this girl.  Couldn't get them all in one room, huh?  Shut up!  There's no photographic evidence.  No, this was, you know...  I was single.  I wasn't married.  This was well before my marriage.  It was just, you know, seeing a girl.  Yeah.  And I decided to cheat. 
[01:54:00]  Cheat.  But then I had to go see the girl, you know?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  So, um...  What to do?  I...  What to do?  I had certain fragrances and aromas on my hands and whatnot.  Oh, boy.  Now I'm like, all right, what do you do?  What do you do?  Yeah.  You make sure, when this happens, you're driving a car that is not dependable.  Not dependable.  So that way, when I doused my hands in gasoline and grease and oil and wiped it all over me 
[01:54:30]  and drove to the house and walked in the door, the first thing out of my mouth is,  Son of a bitchin' car!  And as she came over to me, I went, I'm full of gasoline.  I gotta take a shower.  And I was able to bypass that situation with petroleum.  So how did she eventually catch you, Anthony?  No, you'll...  You know something?  I don't cheat for long.  That's what happens.  I leave the situation.  Believe me. 
[01:55:00]  I don't cheat for long.  I never cheated for very long.  It's not something I leave, go for a long time.  The guilt gets to you.  No.  It's not the guilt.  I would rather move on to a brand new poofah.  If I'm cheating, it means I'm not happy with my situation.  Right.  So then I would move on.  So, you know, you have to cover yourself with gasoline and oil.  No, you don't.  You gotta think quicker on your feet.  What? 
[01:55:30]  Norton, what?  You just go...  You go home and you go, I'm sorry, I'm late.  I stopped off to do a little bass fishing.  Should I bring tackle?  Should I bring a tackle box in the house with me?  Should I have done that?  Say you were shoving caviar into your face.  Little fish eggs all over your fingers.  And if the girl's name was Caviar, that would be even funnier.  Shoving caviar into my face.  You know...  Yes?  Yes, Hopi?  I got caught cheating once in Buffalo when I was doing radio up there. 
[01:56:00]  Mm-hmm.  Because of one...  Can...  Can you say...  What?  What?  Go ahead.  Write it down.  Write it down.  All right.  Norton, just...  For a minute.  Yeah, sure.  I mean, why not?  That's what I'm using.  What?  Yeah, you can say that.  Yeah, I believe you can say that.  Yeah.  I got caught cheating in Buffalo while doing radio.  Yeah.  Because my girlfriend at the time found one pubic hair.  Oh.  Really?  Hell, is she Quincy? 
[01:56:30]  One?  How many would she pick it up with her tweezers and put it in a bag and send it down to the lab?  And I folded...  And you smiled?  And I folded like a cheap tent.  You did?  Folded.  Ass.  Where did she find it?  Pulls the sheets away, and there's one pubic hair.  And I guess it was a different...  It was a different color.  Color than...  Get out of here.  Nailed.  Wow. 
[01:57:00]  Nailed.  Why were you so bad under pressure?  You should have just gone, what are you talking about?  How does she identify it as one of those and as someone else's?  Wait a minute.  What color of hair did she have?  Uh, blonde.  And what color hair was the, uh, pubic in question?  Brown.  Brown.  And she was, like, completely blonde?  Oh, yeah.  Some girls got the blonde hair up top, and then below you're like, hey, hey!  No.  How about you?  No, nice.  No. 
[01:57:30]  You're blonde?  Yes!  It's not about me, douchebag.  It ain't about him.  You could have said it was yours.  Well, no, no.  Because she knows I'm...  Shaved?  Wow, that's a tricky situation now.  No, there's something there.  Because there is nothing you can say.  Where did it come...  Did you have a cat?  Eyelash.  Yeah, an eyelash.  No, even eyelash color.  Well, you know what?  A piece of thread.  You don't break down.  Yeah, it's from this girl.  I just go home.  You're the worst.  Yeah.  You should have jumped on it and said, who the hell did you have in this bed? 
[01:58:00]  Look at Rick nodding.  Yeah.  You're a good move.  Good move.  That's a good ploy.  I folded.  You did.  You folded.  Done.  Did you go, ah, ah, ah, ah?  Did you stutter?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The guilt was all over my face.  Awful.  So then I proceeded to do my own threesome, Anthony.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, but it didn't get quite the publicity-minded.  No.  Two big metropolitan papers.  Well, maybe old Jimmy Norton can have one and then participate in this discussion.  Pony up, whores. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  Opie, you sure it was pubic hair and not back hair?  Very funny.  Rich with a big callback.  Very nice.  It's one of Opie's previous relationships.  No, that was a one-timer.  Right.  That was done to get rid of the old virginity.  The Wookie.  The Wookie.  I don't know if he had sex with a Wookie.  Bonnie, the hairy back.  Opie.  She didn't have a hairy back.  She had a mane. 
[01:59:00]  Opie.  She was beautiful.  But she had this weird birth defect, which gave her hair from her neck all the way down  to her tailbone.  In one thin line.  It is a weird birth defect.  It's called being a silverback.  That's awful.  Her name?  DeVita.  No?  No.  Okay.  I thought maybe.  But it was quite unusual.  Yes.  God damn.  I was not able to go out with her because of that.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  It turned you off.  Oh, yeah.  Was she hairy anywhere else?  Like, was it?  No.  She was gorgeous.  A lot of hair.  Girl, I'm not lying.  Really?  It was gorgeous.  Did you mention it or did she tell you that I have this?  No.  I had to make believe.  I, you know, I was cool with it.  How do you take her to the beach with her chaka stripe?  Wow.  I can't.  We have her running down the street after Opie broke up with us.  There she goes.  All right.  Listen.  We got to take a break.  Because the legend is here, Anthony.  Oh.  Andrew Dice Clay is outside the studio. 
[02:00:00]  He is, is he?  What about Rick's tape, though?  I want to talk about Rick.  All right.  We can do both.  Come on.  Oh, sure we can.  With Dice here?  There's no talking about anything when Dice is here.  Except Dice.  Eh, we'll do both.  Good luck to you.  Rick brought in a very embarrassing tape today when he was...  See?  See?  When he was doing...  Hey, I'm here, huh?  Hey, Jacob.  Hey, Jack.  Dice.  Hold on.  Okay.  We're going to give you the big intro in a minute here.  Look at your... 
[02:00:30]  Your sunglasses are so big.  Dice, your sunglasses are gigantic.  They're gigantic.  That's so I can put a big fat chick's ass on them.  How you doing, legend?  You're not laughing at it, Anthony?  That was funny.  I didn't even hear him.  I'm not in the mood for this.  What is he not in the mood for?  That was funny.  I'm here.  Why?  Huh?  I'm not comfortable in the studio.  Where do you get those sunglasses?  Your sunglasses are like the windshield of a 747. 
[02:01:00]  Look at those things.  Where do you get those?  Let me set myself.  You all right?  Yeah, they're big.  I'm all set.  They're big glasses.  They're very big.  I like the blue blockers.  Looks like you got it all figured out.  They block out the blue.  It looks like you got it all figured out.  It looks like you're going scuba diving.  What do you got, goggles?  You got it all figured out.  I'm the goggles of Paisano.  You got it all figured out.  Yeah.  You got it all figured out. 
[02:01:30]  What's the matter, Dice?  No, I'm all set.  I like your glasses.  They're big.  You got it all figured out.  Bigger in life like Dice.  I'm all set now.  You need an air tank on your back.  I'm all set.  Scoop and goggles.  All right.  We'll take a break.  I'm doing Old Navy commercials because that old broad guy.  Because you got it all figured out, right?  Because I got it all figured out.  You got it all figured out, don't you?  Dice, you're playing where tonight?  Nowhere.  Tomorrow is?  Where's tomorrow?  Westbury.  I'm trying to give you a good plug here before we get a break. 
[02:02:00]  Are we going to come back?  I'm at Westbury tomorrow.  All right.  Westbury.  They put 200 more tickets on sale.  Oh, for the Beacon.  Oh, boy.  Do you know where you're going to be?  Westbury tomorrow night, right?  Yes, Westbury tomorrow night.  Tickets available.  And then the Beacon Friday.  Yeah.  I was just at Harley-Davidson at Lexington between 56 and 57.  Oh, boy.  I told them I'll be at Westbury tomorrow night, which is what date? 
[02:02:30]  I don't even know.  It's Thursday.  Oh, you got it all figured out, right?  I got it figured out.  Is this nice school?  I think we got nice school today.  I just walked in.  Don't get me mad.  I'm not getting you mad.  I just walked in.  You got a Pepsi and a cigarette there.  I know this is what you do.  Yeah.  This is all you do.  I'm buying a T-shirt.  This is all I do.  I'm buying a T-shirt.  Yeah.  Over there.  We got a break.  Negotiating a price.  Oh, you got to go on a break?  Yeah.  Well, if you're asking me something.  Because I want to give you the plug.  I know.  But can we do that when we come back? 
[02:03:00]  That's what I was saying.  I'm going to give you another.  I'm all set now.  I'm going to give you another plug when you come back.  And you were going to come back and give me the intro.  I was going to add.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I haven't seen Jordan.  I haven't seen you guys.  It's been a while.  You know what I mean?  I come in.  Take office.  Already he starts.  Well, I did not.  I did not.  Your sunglasses are a little too big.  Because they're my...  For who?  For you?  For anybody.  For you.  Maybe for you.  Maybe for you.  They seem big.  They seem very large.  They are large.  They're like the Hubble telescope thing.  That's very good. 
[02:03:30]  No.  Are you able to see...  Maybe I wear glasses like him.  Are you able to see...  Give me those glasses.  Are you pointing at Ben?  No, just for a minute.  No, Ben.  Give me the glasses.  Ben doesn't play.  He doesn't take his glasses off.  Ben doesn't play.  Take John's.  Take John's glasses.  No, those are different kinds.  Yeah, those are more John Lennon glasses.  They're little, though.  They're little.  Yeah, see how many those are?  Now, look what happened.  Put the glasses on.  Put them on.  Look what I do.  Look what I do.  Whatever his name is.  It's John's glasses.  Actually, I just want that.  You look like...  Wow.  You look like a good lady professor.  Put this on, and I'm all set.  Now, you're nice cool. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, go back to these glasses, the little stupid ones, right?  Actually, Mr. Barty, actually, I was still thinking about the hat-trick.  Actually, I thought that would be very nice.  Maybe later, once you get it in a test, I'll come over and sign it.  As you go from one glass to another.  Then I go like this.  It makes for a great radio bid, Dice. 
[02:04:30]  Now, you change back to the line.  Actually, the other day is a trick is, uh...  Actually...  I don't think that'll go...  Now, you go back to the big glasses.  Forget it.  All right.  Forget it now.  Where's the guy with it?  All right.  You're going to do it all day?  Get out of here.  What?  You're going to do it all day?  All right.  Come on.  I thought we're going to...  We're going to break.  We're going to break.  We're going to break.  And then Westbury.  And then the Beacon.  You know, we've got to figure out better ways of doing plugs.  I've got to be honest.  Yeah?  Because the general populations... 
[02:05:00]  Populations?  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  Like, when you're doing a plug, you've got to...  I don't know how to do it.  You've got to work it in subtle?  Yeah.  Like when I do the Harley thing.  Right.  Harley Davidson.  Oh, that's very subtle.  They gave me a 3% discount to say their name.  What are you getting?  They gave you that jacket for free.  They gave me a T-shirt.  A T-shirt and a jacket.  You don't get nothing for free.  You got that T-shirt for free.  For nothing.  Free.  No, I didn't get...  I had a fake.  They didn't see the couple shirts I stuffed in the bag. 
[02:05:30]  The bag guy.  You know what I mean?  We're going to break.  We're going to...  We're going to talk to...  Why are you going to break?  We're going to talk now.  We've got to go.  Now I'm in the mood for right now.  We're going to talk.  When I came in, I wasn't in the mood.  I had to get set.  You just will be back and you can talk.  All right.  You know what?  We're going to talk to you.  It's your show.  You're going to do what you're going to do anyway.  That's right.  You know what I mean?  This young lady is flashing her privates.  Whip about Wednesday with Opie and Anthony.  A bunch of girls ashing their boobs, which is cool.  Wow! 
[02:06:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Our old pal in the studio.  We haven't seen him in a while, Anthony.  It's Andrew Dice Clay.  We've got it all figured out.  He's playing Westbury Music Fair tomorrow night.  Some tickets still available.  And the big show is The Beacon on Friday night with Andrew Dice Clay.  How come I can't hear me now?  And we've got...  We've been playing games already.  No, no, no.  We've got Dice's whole gang in here. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, actually.  All the annoying people that follow him around.  Oh, Jesus.  Wait a minute.  There it is.  There it is.  Dice, we already discussed your glasses.  I've got to bring up an observation.  It's an entourage.  You've got an ashtray in front of you and a cigarette, but you stopped smoking.  Yeah, so?  Everybody has to...  So what are you doing?  It's not me.  It's Norton.  He's taking the ashtray out like, of course, I'm seeing an ashtray.  I'm going to start smoking because he quit.  That's how he works it.  But you still buy cigarettes?  Yeah, he's one of those smokers that, you know, the minute you quit, you cough at everybody 
[02:07:00]  else smoking.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, you shouldn't do that.  Smoking's a bad habit.  Yeah.  So is wiping your ass with a shower gun.  We're allowed to say that one.  Of course.  I don't know.  Now, Dice, do you still buy cigarettes, though?  Yes.  And you hold them?  Yeah, so what?  Don't you do things...  Not like that.  Not like that.  You know, you either commit to something or not.  That's kind of...  It looks kind of silly.  It's not like Dice.  I think Dice would go, I don't need cigarettes. 
[02:07:30]  And you throw it away like Dice.  I like the cigarettes.  Not like, oh, I'll hold them a while.  You've got to understand, I never liked the smoke.  Right.  I was never into smoke.  Right.  Smoke annoys me.  Right.  So I just figured I've got to quit lighting them.  Oh, is that it?  But yet I'm getting the same rush.  What dictates when you have to throw one away?  Well, what happens is you get all sogged out.  When it gets soggy?  Yeah.  It gets all sogged out.  It's like when you've got to throw your chick away. 
[02:08:00]  Hey!  You know what I'm talking about.  I hear you.  Like you've got one of those chicks, right?  Yeah.  Let's say you've been pinching your helmet all day long.  Right.  All right.  Right.  So you've built up like 52 full ounces, right?  Okay.  That's the hot soup, right?  So you just keep unloading.  You just keep unloading, right?  Right.  All of a sudden, she's like a sponge that can't take no more.  Right.  Saturated.  That's how you work a cigarette.  And then you throw it away.  Why does Kenny have to be behind you?  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  Is he protecting you?  I mean, no one's going to beat you up around here. 
[02:08:30]  Why does he have to stand right next to you like that?  He's making us all uncomfortable.  I'm his body gone.  Do me a favor.  All right.  There you go.  Why is he making you uncomfortable?  Because he's all big and stuff.  He can beat anyone up in here.  Oh, look.  We're all friends here.  Everybody's happy.  Norton's here.  Yeah.  Just at town hall this week.  Did a great job.  Wasn't it this week?  Yeah, it was April.  I was last night.  Yeah, when was it?  Gee, we all forgot the date.  You didn't say it enough times.  And Dice, turn us on to Jimmy Norton. 
[02:09:00]  That's right.  Okay, our little Jimmy Norton was opening up for Dice for quite a while.  Now look at him.  And it's all working out for everybody.  Now he's all set.  He's all set, Dice.  All set.  Sure.  Now I got Jason Rubito.  Jason, hi.  How are you?  Yeah, he's my new opener.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  Does he talk?  Does he talk?  Yeah, he does good.  You've got to see him.  Well, nodding really works on the radio.  You know what?  He doesn't talk.  What do you care what he does?  What do you get embarrassed?  I'm going to see what he sounds like.  What do you mean?  What's he supposed to do?  Say hi.  I told him before we came up here, you guys don't like when performers do bits. 
[02:09:30]  This is just what happens.  No, this is no bit, but I want the guy to say hi.  We're going to hear what his voice sounds like, maybe.  The people want to hear what the guy that's opening up for Dice sounds like.  He's got a lot of personality.  He's got a lot of personality.  Oh, he's got his personality.  You see what I mean?  They're doing bits.  No, no.  We're not doing any bits.  What does that mean?  You always say that.  They're doing bits.  And that's not.  I just said the guy's got a lot of personality. 
[02:10:00]  And that's not.  A lot of personality.  He's got personality.  Personality.  Personality.  Walk.  Personality.  That's not the guy that opens up for you, though.  But that's not the guy.  It's not the point.  He's a weird guy.  The point is, I don't want him to do his bits.  He's a weird looking guy.  Because, what do you mean he's a weird looking guy?  He's a little.  It's Titanium Todd.  Yeah, I know.  It's Todd.  You know how that is.  Yeah.  How does he feel that he was second fiddle to Rich Voss? 
[02:10:30]  Oh, thanks.  Hey, how do you feel you were second fiddle to Rich Voss?  What does that mean?  Dice wanted Rich Voss to open up.  You know, I actually forgot I even invited him to open up.  Really?  Yes.  And then what?  And don't get me wrong.  I like Rich.  Rich, but if I don't see him or hear him, I never, ever think of him.  Ever.  Like, if you guys never brought, if nobody ever brought him up.  Right.  And like 20 years from now, they go, oh, Rich Voss just came out to LA. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, yeah, I remember that.  I forgot that that guy was alive.  Right.  That's how his audience feels, sure.  That's right.  Right after he leaves the stage, they forget about him.  Couldn't do it or something, because of, um...  He shot a pilot.  Yeah, he shot a movie for VH1 about, uh...  Some went on with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.  No, it's a pilot he's got for a show.  They did things the way men did comedy back then, when comedy was done, the way men did it.  Like dinosaurs. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, of course.  You're here.  I hear me.  We all hear you.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like yesterday, I was having breakfast over there, like...  And today, I'm having the same kind of breakfast, almost like...  Like that breakfast happened at that moment.  The way you would have things done back then.  Right.  Like men did it.  Right.  All right. 
[02:12:00]  The head.  I hear me.  Why hasn't Happy Face said anything yet?  He's listening the way he used...  Remember the way he used to come up here back then?  Yeah.  Like years ago.  He was very scared.  The way men respected other men to say what they had to say, like their piece.  Right.  That's that then.  Yeah, exactly.  Happy Face, you want to say anything?  When the legend speaks, people listen.  Oh, is that it? 
[02:12:30]  I can't believe it.  No, I was just making a statement.  All right.  Yeah, I understand.  And can we have Club Soda Kenny say something?  Sure.  We haven't heard him in a while, because I think you kicked him out of your entourage for a while.  Yeah, what happened?  Was there a falling out, Kenny?  There was no falling out.  It was the same thing like Rich Voss.  I was very sick.  You were sick?  Yeah.  What did you have?  Don't talk about me.  Let's talk about Andrew.  I just...  You know what?  Number one, we were talking about Rich.  Did I compliment him?  Did you see him?  I'm not done talking about Rich.  Is his smile as beautiful as the sunrise?  You know what I mean? 
[02:13:00]  You can't say that.  Is his smile as beautiful as the sunrise?  His smile is as beautiful as the sunrise.  Look at him and dice his shoulder and then he smiles.  Do you want to...  His arches are as strong as the Barrazzano Bridge.  On his feet?  His arches?  How have you known about Dice's arches?  Like, how do you even know that?  He doesn't.  Do you want to get with him?  He's the American legend.  Are you gay for him?  Is that it? 
[02:13:30]  I will do anything he told me to.  Oh, my God.  Len, how do you feel about that, Dice?  Put your jacket on.  Get on.  Wait up, son.  What?  How do you feel then he would do anything for you?  Wait for your mouth, come on.  Even, you know, he would play with the balloon knot.  Yeah, he would do anything for you.  That means, like, treat you like...  You know, you could treat him like a woman.  What do you guys got a thing with faggots?  All of a sudden.  All of a sudden.  That people do.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Excuse me. 
[02:14:00]  Faggots.  I'm protesting outside this show.  Okay?  I didn't know you were.  I had it all figured out.  You know, they're entitled to love, too.  We don't mind the facts.  You know what I mean?  So what?  They're faggots.  So what?  They don't know how sick they is.  You know what I mean?  They need a good...  You know, like all we were doing, driving down here.  Look at her.  Look at that ass.  Look at her bull.  Look at this.  You know what I mean?  They're looking at...  Oh, look at him.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Look at the way he cuts his burns.  Look at him.  You know what I mean?  You had a problem with the gay people. 
[02:14:30]  I never.  I used to give them publicity.  No, they would protest.  That's the difference.  They would protest outside your shows, Doug.  Because they didn't get it, obviously.  They didn't like the way you would talk about the gays.  I would talk about the trans testicles, the bi-sickness that they have, that they can't decide.  You know, it was things like that.  You don't talk about their rises.  No, no.  I would talk about the different kind of faggotitos that they put out there today.  They put out?  Like, years ago, they had, like, old school faggotitos. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  Yeah.  The kind, I like a boy, and that's that.  Yeah.  And I stay inside my house in the closet with him.  And we pinch helmets.  Okay.  Today, you got the ones that dress up like Sissy Mary's there.  Yeah.  With a dress and the other thing that they wear, you know, through the split of the cul-de-sac.  Okay.  To separate them.  Right. 
[02:15:30]  And then you got the ones, you know, that just, uh, sicken me.  You're out of your mind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like dinosaurs, I like them.  Old school faggots.  The old school ones.  The kind of faggot that said, I'm not a faggot.  I really do like girls.  Next thing you know, he's wearing mommy's panties.  Okay.  You know, today they come out, oh, I'm out of the closet.  You know what? 
[02:16:00]  Get in.  You don't like them out of the closet?  It's not that.  I don't, you know, like, believe me, I could just drop pint after pint all day.  Of hot soup.  It's what I do.  Okay.  It's all I do.  You know what I mean?  That's, that's what I get up for.  To do that.  Yes, nice.  But, you know, I don't walk around all day going, you know, oh, bend over.  And do that.  And then I do the other thing.  And then, hot soup.  Hot soup.  You know what I mean? 
[02:16:30]  Mr. President.  Hot soup.  Hot soup.  Mr. President.  Did you say call me too?  Did you say show me too?  Hot soup.  You know what I mean?  I don't do that.  Right.  I do it at the direct moment of impact.  That's how I work.  Are you having a nervous breakdown?  You know, but no, but these guys are out there going, I'm not afraid to say I like other  men.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's not right.  It's not right.  It just doesn't work.  All right.  Are you being dice cool right now?  No, I'm explaining a theory.  Oh, you're being dice. 
[02:17:00]  I'm explaining a theory.  Like, I got no problem.  You're with a chick, right?  A theory.  You're with a chick.  Yeah.  And you want to explore the other half of her.  What do you mean?  The back half?  Yeah.  All right.  It's like, you know, the front is trying to mush because you pummel it constantly.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  You just pummel it.  It's an assault.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like, Todd, what do you weigh?  Because he's very, like...  I weigh about 85, about 97 pounds.  All right.  So he's like, no, you're like 115, 120, right? 
[02:17:30]  About a buck 20.  But then, picture a buck 20 just smacking into the center.  With everything you got.  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  So it's going to get splattered.  Right.  It's splattered.  So now what you do, you don't, like, force yourself on her.  You turn her over with her eggs all jacked up.  Yeah.  You take your dumb.  What?  You take your dumb.  Your dumb?  Your gum?  Your dumb.  You dip with your dumb.  You know, like you dip a chip into sauce.  You know, like you were in the Italian restaurant. 
[02:18:00]  You take a little bread, you dip it in.  You take your dumb.  Yes, you're dumb.  And you dip it in the dumb.  What is that?  What, what, does she like this?  No, but I'm saying, faggotitos do the same thing.  Yeah.  It's just wrong.  To dip.  Because you don't have that other crap down there.  That turns the worst.  That you can at least go, oh, it's really a chick.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like when you start feeling sick about taking your thumb and dipping it in the thing. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  You see that, you know, all the hair, you know.  Right, it's still a girl.  You know, the chuck steak, whatever they call it.  You're all right with it because you know she's a chick.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I got you.  But do you, does that mean, because I'm getting a little something from you that maybe when  you're dipping, you're feeling a little gay?  No.  Even if it's a girl?  No.  That you have to reassure yourself by looking that it's a girl?  No, because it's pushed on us so often.  Yeah.  Because I studied this.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  What school did you study at? 
[02:19:00]  I'm old school.  I studied like old school style.  Back in the old days.  In the old days.  He's doing that luck again, Ant.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, taking my thumb.  Yeah.  And I'm like, dang, don't freak over here now.  And pummel.  And I says to her like that.  Yeah.  And then she says, I'm all set.  I said, are you short-haired? 
[02:19:30]  And she says again, I'm all set.  Yeah.  And?  That's what I say.  Yeah, that's what you say.  When you dip.  I got to come up with words on this show.  Well, dip is good.  You know what's funny?  I call in, I hear the filthiest things ever on the show when I call.  Yeah.  The minute I get in, oh, you can't say that.  You can't say that.  No.  You don't understand how to put it in terms that you can say these things. 
[02:20:00]  You know what I mean?  You can say anything.  You can't say those things.  You can say anything as long as you put it in the right context.  Unless it's like Star Blaster, like the movie.  Star Blaster?  Star Blaster.  Yeah, that big movie.  I know, Brain Smasher.  Orange Clock.  We like the Brain Smasher.  No, I'm not talking about that.  Brain Smasher was good.  He doesn't want to talk about it.  No, I'm not talking about Brain Smasher.  That was good.  You were a cop in that, right?  Yeah, whatever.  Kind of renegade cop.  20 years ago.  What are you talking about?  I like the movie.  I'll come over there and choke you to death.  I like the movie.  Give me something to hit him with.  What? 
[02:20:30]  No, that's right.  A smack you in the face with the answer.  I like it.  I'll just do it.  I don't even care.  We enjoyed the Brain Smasher.  But I'm not talking about that.  You just brought it up.  No, I said Brain Clock.  And I said Brain Smasher.  The same way they go faster than one guy.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Everything stops.  It's a kid's movie.  Time stopper.  Time stopper.  It stinks.  Who's playing that?  It stinks.  It's just like Back to the Future.  Who would you play in that?  You should put it back in the can and tell the director to wipe his ass with it.  That's how bad it was.  If I ever see him, I'm going to punch him in the face. 
[02:21:00]  Make me spend the money.  Well, I wouldn't hit him.  One Night at McCall's was great.  I would just tell him, you know.  You're very good in that thing.  How do they say something's like something?  One Night at McCall's.  Every movie.  That was good.  Every movie in the world.  Wait a minute.  Every movie in the world.  When you go and buy it like a billboard or a poster.  You ever notice it's a best movie.  Every movie's best movie of the year.  Right.  A must-see movie.  And they all stink.  Really?  Why don't they put one sign that says, you see this movie over here?  They'd say like, it stinks.  It sucks.  Everybody would go see it. 
[02:21:30]  It would be the biggest of the year.  This movie is garbage.  Don't check it out.  They put the good movie thing on.  Please, don't waste your money.  Shut up.  I'll come over there.  No.  Don't throw it.  I'm in a bad mood.  Hey, what happened to your cigarette?  Were you done with that one?  Now he flicks them at people.  Yeah.  He flicks it at me.  That's dangerous.  When they're lit.  When they're not lit, what's going to happen?  Ouch.  Tobacco stinker.  I've got to have another one now.  Now he pulls out another one.  Cigarette.  A net.  You know what I just did?  That's not an NIV.  That's right.  You see, I threw that in. 
[02:22:00]  That was good.  A net.  That's right.  If you do some Travolta, I'm bored with it.  I did it already.  How long are you going to do it?  For 20 minutes?  I did a perfect impression, not even thinking about it.  I came out with it.  You know what I mean?  Threw it at you.  Thrilled you.  And then a stupefaction face over here.  No, no.  Besides, now I'm going to do 10 more minutes for the same impression.  Well, a net cigarette was double J, and you were doing Travolta, so you screwed it up.  It doesn't matter.  What do you mean screw it up?  He didn't say a net cigarette. 
[02:22:30]  What?  Am I paid to know who says what line?  He didn't say a net cigarette.  I do the line I want.  He didn't say it.  No, but I take the character and do the perfect impression of another guy who was doing it in the movie.  So say cigarette and net is double J.  No, I don't do that impression.  Well, what do you do?  You do that impression.  That's right.  I just do Travolta going, come on, I'm bored with it.  So I didn't say I'm doing Travolta.  That was double J.  No, it was.  It was not.  It just sounded a lot like Travolta.  Don't you guys get it?  Not at all.  What other impressions, Dice?  What else?  Now I'll do Travolta. 
[02:23:00]  Doing the same line.  Let's do it.  Cigarette and net.  Are you going to do it all day?  No, what I'm saying is, first I did double J doing the line, and I did Travolta doing the line.  But Travolta never did the line.  That's what I'm saying.  No, but he did it here.  Right now.  You're rewriting the script.  Well, what do I got to know it exact?  You know when people...  He's got a thousand lines that you could have done in the movie.  Donnie.  Donnie.  Don't talk, Donnie.  You look like me.  You dress like me, Donnie. 
[02:23:30]  It's what I do, Gail.  That's very good.  It's all I do, Gail.  You see what I did, but I did me.  Like what Gino doing me just now, I did.  Really?  Right, Happy, what'd you think of that?  It was wonderful, I'm sure.  I love everything you do.  Right, right, right.  Jason Rubito.  There's adoration there.  My new opening act.  I know, but he doesn't talk.  Because he's a little fray.  Does he do impressions?  Does he do any impressions?  You do any impressions?  You do an impression?  What do you do?  Murenta Fuego, Amo. 
[02:24:00]  What?  You've got to hear it when he really does it.  What the hell is that?  Wow.  Did you hear that?  Was that Scarface?  Perfect.  Yeah?  Do it again.  Let's hear it a little.  Murenta Fuego, Amo.  Yeah, that's not bad.  They're going to love him at Westbury.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Why do you think he's not talking?  Well, he's saving it up.  He's getting ready for the show tomorrow night at Westbury.  That's the goof.  When the King of the View didn't show up, Voss.  Yeah.  The King of the View.  Do you remember that?  Yes.  Remember how awful that was? 
[02:24:30]  Opie.  You're the one that called me and said, did you see Voss?  I didn't see Voss.  Oh, it was terrible.  It was awful.  Well, you watched the View.  You know what?  You should have actually been fined from the comics of America for going on a show and doing it.  That kind of thing.  I like the new comics of America that could find it.  Unless he just wanted to get that close to Joy's big boobs.  You know what I mean?  You watched the View?  I give it a little deej right on the...  You watched that?  You liked the View?  What's wrong with the View?  It's for fags.  He was on the View. 
[02:25:00]  What do you mean it's for fags?  It's for a house fowl.  Why are they going to get mad?  I don't even understand being on it more than watching it.  I watch it every day.  Are you a house fowl?  That ain't right.  It gets me angry.  You're ruining your image.  No, no.  It gets me.  You don't understand.  It gets me angry.  What angers you?  Because you watch shows today.  The fat one?  No, listen.  Forget about the fat.  Fat could always be changed.  Ugly is forever.  That's the way it works.  Like when you watch Sex and the City with them mutts, right?  No boobs, no butts. 
[02:25:30]  But yet they're successful.  That can never happen for a woman.  You don't have a top or a bottom and you're making money?  It can never happen.  Now shows like Drees Company, remember that?  Right.  Okay.  Suzanne Somers.  Nice.  Big boobs.  Nice.  You saw the shorts, you know, splitting the thing there.  Right.  The camel toe.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  You know, the front bumper.  The front bumper.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  You saw that.  She had the hair and pigtails always acting stupid. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  You know, believable.  Shut your mouth.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  Frenchie.  How are you doing?  It's Frenchie, Dice.  I want to say hello to the Jim Norton, the man of the show today.  Okay.  How are you doing, Jim?  You're the legend.  Oh.  It's a French, Dice.  Hey, Dice.  How are you doing?  You fuck bastards.  Yeah, let me tell you something.  Why don't you shut your mouth, all right? 
[02:26:30]  Let me tell you something.  Why don't you shut your mouth and give him some respect?  Why don't you get off the phone and shut your face down here?  I'll put my boot in your throat.  You understand me?  Frenchie, you faggot.  Hey, you French people ever win a war?  You faggot.  You're a faggot.  You're a faggot.  You're a faggot.  Go live between your mother's legs.  That's where you belong.  You're a faggot.  You're a faggot.  You don't ever make fun of a legend.  He's a legend.  He's a star.  He's playing the Beacon Theater Friday night. 
[02:27:00]  He's playing Westbury.  Not you, you French faggot.  You're a faggot.  What do you do besides cook snails?  You faggot.  I want to talk to the lady, Jim.  What do you got again?  The guy's just trying to say hello.  It's disrespect.  It's disrespectful.  What do you got?  What do you got?  I don't like him either, Andrew.  Well, that's what they do.  I saw him at Norton's show.  That's their fun.  Oh, you met Frenchy at Norton's show.  Yeah, he wet his pants when he's seen me.  Hey, Frenchy.  That's why he's a big shot on the phone. 
[02:27:30]  What happened when you met Kenny?  Hey, Frenchy, what happened when you met Club Soda Kenny?  I actually like Frenchy.  I don't know.  He was a very nice guy, actually.  Yeah, you better say that.  Yeah, you better say that.  Is it true that you wet yourself when he came up to you?  I did the backdoor action there, you know.  It went all over my pen.  He's French dice.  I really don't see a problem with this guy.  He's French dice.  He's French dice.  Give us some more dice, Frenchy.  Wait, I want to hear.  French dice.  I'm not going to do it all day.  How long is he going to do it for now? 
[02:28:00]  You got mad at me for doing cigarettes?  I remember.  But he could do this for two hours.  I didn't get mad how long you were doing it.  I got mad because you didn't do the right character.  But what line do you need?  I don't know.  Hey, I'm bored with it, all right?  I'm bored with it, all right?  Get rid of this guy.  I'm just bored with him.  All right, Frenchy.  I'm bored with it.  You know, I'm not dancing in 2001.  Right.  You know, and I thought maybe we could dance together.  You remember me, Tony Manale?  We looked at, oh, I look at a guy.  Every quarter of a second. 
[02:28:30]  And he gets to go.  He's a manager.  Oh, I know the type.  I know the type.  And I guess it starts with a C, Mr. B.  Go scratch your ears.  See, I'm perfect.  We're not trying.  We're going to take a break.  We're not even trying.  We got Dice in the studio, Westbury Music Fair tomorrow night,  and the Beacon Theater on Friday.  Absolutely.  We're going to the Beacon Theater show on Friday.  See, that sounds like a professional plug.  Who cares? 
[02:29:00]  They don't care.  Flip them out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One day.  Go.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I love that.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, we're hanging with Andrew Dice Clay today.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Dice playing the Westbury Music Fair tomorrow night.  Yeah.  And the Beacon Theater Friday.  We'll be at the Beacon show on Friday with Dice. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  What's it put out there?  They have approximately 300 more tickets they just put on sale for the Beacon Theater this morning.  Thank you, Happy Face.  Nice.  You're welcome, sir.  I said to Dice, it looks like he lost some weight in.  It looks like he's in shape.  I can't believe it.  And then he gets insulted.  And the next thing I know, he's...  Don is some gorgeous.  How do you even say any of that?  He's ready to show me his, his, his, I don't know, what were you going to show us?  A little thing.  All of a sudden, he's pulling his shirt up so we can get a closer look.  Well, Anthony was getting all excited. 
[02:30:00]  That's when he started popping.  I said, you're working out that day.  He started feeling a little blood flow.  I was.  It's not as much as when you played a Tony Schlongini in Wacko, but, you know, because  you looked good then.  Where are you pulling this stuff out?  Tony Schlongini.  I think I was 14 when I did Tony Schlongini.  Tell me he's lying.  No, that's the first movie ever.  Yeah.  Dice's first movie.  Oh, come on.  Tony Schlongini.  I know your career.  Give us a line as Tony Schlongini.  All right. 
[02:30:30]  You want a line as Tony Schlongini?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  You really want a line as Tony Schlongini?  Let's see a one.  Wait, I got to think of Tony Schlongini.  It's not a Nets cigarette.  Hey, Rosie.  Remember that part?  No.  When I did that?  Not at all.  That was the beginning.  I come down the stairs.  Yeah.  And they sing, everyone's talking about him.  Yeah.  You've got to sing the song.  I don't know the song offhand.  Tony Schlongini.  I haven't seen the movie in quite some time there, Dice, and it wasn't one that stuck in 
[02:31:00]  my head.  Why not?  Why are you bringing it up?  Because I'm a fan of your career.  Yeah, I kind of know one of the movies.  You know, there's a lot of people that love Tony Schlongini.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's the line, then?  Give us a little one.  Well, when I say to the guy, you know, I'm going to punch you in the head or something  like that.  And it sounded like Travolta?  Yes.  Because that was, he was Tony Schlongini, which was a takeoff of Travolta.  Right.  He doesn't remember Tony Schlongini.  Like the takeoff of Tony Manero.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There he goes.  And what do you do? 
[02:31:30]  You go to 2001 on your Friday night and you blow all of your money, right?  Yeah, that's right.  There you go.  Well, you got some Stairway to the Stars.  That's Tony Schlongini.  Oh, no.  It's Tony Manero.  Tony, it was written better.  Yeah?  No, it's Tony Schlongini.  There's a lot of lines.  So you didn't change any of the lines then?  No, no.  There were a lot of lines.  Tony Schlongini and Tony Manero.  Same script.  It was just very similar.  But that's the same line.  No, no. 
[02:32:00]  Dance of 2001?  No.  It just happened.  I don't know.  You have a doofy friend with big shoes that jumps off the Verrazano?  No.  That didn't happen in that movie?  No.  Yeah?  But what happened?  He goes, you see?  Now you're Pig.  Oh, well, he didn't say Pig in Saturday Night Live.  In the PG version, my friend.  It's Pig.  And also in the Tony Schlongini version.  Because it was a PG movie.  Oh, yeah?  So they had to say Pig.  Yeah.  All right.  When she goes with double J. 
[02:32:30]  Only it was triple J.  Well, she went with all of them, yeah.  In the Tony Schlongini movie.  Oh, was it?  They go, you see that?  Now you're Pig.  Did you have a priest brother that left the priesthood?  No, he was a father.  He'll go back.  He'll go back.  Yeah.  No, he won't.  No, he won't.  Yes, he won't.  No, he won't.  Yes, he will.  No, he won't.  He's not.  Now you got two garbage kids.  Garbage, but he said piece of S.  No, that was in the R rating.  Oh, the PG and Tony Schlongini?  That's right. 
[02:33:00]  And Tony Schlongini said the same thing.  Don't touch the hair.  He always hits my hair and it hurts.  I noticed that club sort of Kenny's not laughing.  Yeah, what's the matter, Kenny?  What's wrong, Kenny?  You're enjoying it.  Boy, you look bored.  Any comments about how terrific he was, like in Night Patrol or Casual Sex?  A lot of casual sex, of course.  He'll get to that.  He'll get to that.  He'll get to it, maybe.  Or maybe Anthony wants to do his terrific impression of Julia Child.  Hey, what's wrong with Julia Child?  No, I love it.  I've been waiting to hear it. 
[02:33:30]  We kind of enjoy the Julia Child.  But you're not smiling when Dice is performing.  I'm in awe.  What's wrong?  He's in awe.  Again.  Again.  Who, not Joe, wants to say hi?  Hold on, Joe.  What about Anthony with the Tom Brokenjaw?  That's a lot of fun, isn't it?  It's not about us today.  It's about Dice.  It's about the legend.  They can, like, do dueling impressions.  That's not about us now today.  It's about Andrew.  I'm glad you realized that.  It's about Dice.  Joe, what's up?  It's not about you, Kenny.  Hey, Dice. 
[02:34:00]  Dice?  Balloon, not Joe.  Dice?  Dice, Dice, baby.  Is Dice there?  Hey, hold on.  All right, I'm all set.  Hey, Dice, are you feeling all right?  Because your voice sounds different.  Yeah, I'm all set.  Oh, boy.  It's a little screwy.  I've got to take something to see that.  You're going to be all right for the shows?  No, I should be all right.  Wait a minute.  Need some tea with honey?  Yeah, a little tea.  A little tea. 
[02:34:30]  Tony.  Let me test it.  Donnie.  It'll work.  Yeah, it'll work, man.  I want to hear more Starface from your guy over there.  Oh, the opener?  Yeah.  Jason.  Jason Rubito.  He seems more relaxed now.  Yeah, I'm all right now.  He might be ready to talk.  What happened?  Yeah.  What do you want to hear?  No, you don't say that.  That's not how you do right now.  Because there'll be a million emails in one second going, that's the new opener.  What do you want to hear?  You don't work like that.  Just do it.  That's it.  What do you want? 
[02:35:00]  No.  No.  So it works.  That's good, right?  Yeah.  It sounds like Spanish.  It is Spanish.  Nah, that can't happen.  Have any Puerto Rican call here.  They'll say exactly what it just said.  That's not real Spanish.  Use their phone card for that.  Do your other one.  Do you want to hear?  The fucker, I don't know. 
[02:35:30]  See that?  At least you got somebody that is a lot like Voss to open for you.  They'll loosen up.  Look, they just found a new target in you.  That's all right.  You're fine.  Don't ever let them hurt you.  He's no dice as Kurt in Private Resort.  You know, that got me going.  How do you know that?  Why?  I don't get it.  You know, Private.  You know the character.  I didn't even remember.  Kurt.  Kurt.  That's a great character.  I don't remember. 
[02:36:00]  You got a lot of personality in that.  You don't remember being Kurt?  Why would I remember him?  Give me a line from Kurt.  All right.  Let me do Kurt for you.  All right.  This is Kurt.  Here's Kurt.  All right.  Because that was with Johnny Depp, if you remember.  Oh, big star.  Sure.  Okay.  So I come over to him and I say like this.  You know how all those girls are down in 2001?  I'm with my girl.  Maybe you let me use your room, eh?  No, wait.  That's Kurt.  It sounds like Tony Slangini. 
[02:36:30]  No, but it was a takeoff.  Doing Tony.  See, I got hired.  Yeah.  No, I got hired.  Yeah.  Because they saw what I did at Slangini.  Your work at Slangini.  So they expect you.  Right.  Like the same persona.  Yeah.  That's why they hired you.  Like when Travolta went from fever to grease.  It's pretty much the same guy.  Same guy.  They just put him back in line.  So now I'm stuck in this persona.  Yeah.  You broke out of that, though, later on.  And then I had a fight with Hector Alizazando.  Yeah.  And I says like this to him. 
[02:37:00]  Donnie.  Now that don't sound like Kurt.  No, no, no, no.  He says to me.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, no.  He called me Kurt.  Kurt.  Doesn't that sound like him?  Yeah, just like it.  Kurt.  Yeah.  Do you know what I did today, Kurt?  No, I don't know.  You'll have no idea, my friend.  Well, you got to explain it to me because, you know, because I'm here my partner.  Yeah.  You know, and then Johnny Depp walks in and goes, I can't let you use my room. 
[02:37:30]  Is that Sylvester Stallone?  No.  Why does he sound like Johnny Depp?  Because at that time, Depp had more of a character going like a Rocky Balboa.  I don't understand.  No.  You know what I mean?  I don't remember that phase.  What do you mean you don't remember?  How do you remember that Johnny Depp phase of being like Sly?  When it was all bulked up, before he shredded, before he did Jump Street.  Before Jump Street?  Playing all those parts, you know, like that Stallone type of thing.  I completely don't know.  You know, I got to go with that girl. 
[02:38:00]  You know, you shouldn't.  This is Johnny Depp.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's exactly the perfect exact line.  All right.  And he goes, look, you got to get out of the room and give me one of them condominiums.  Right.  You know, so I can go with the girl.  But he's not saying right.  Yeah.  And then he jumps off the Verrazano Bridge wearing the big platform shoes.  Why didn't you call me, Tony?  There was no bridge in the movie.  Tony, you didn't call me.  Bobby, Bobby. 
[02:38:30]  Bobby, come off the bridge.  You're making me very nervous, Bobby.  Look, Tony, I'm dancing.  Look, Tony.  Look at me, Tony.  Look at me.  Look at me, Tony.  Bobby, come in the car.  Bobby, come in the car.  Tony, look at me.  What do you want to talk about, Bobby?  Look at me, Tony.  Bobby, Bobby.  You didn't call me.  Why would you learn that, Bobby?  Why would you even bother to learn that?  I've seen the movie.  You know, I had a car accident with that guy. 
[02:39:00]  Did you?  No way.  The guy with those platform shoes?  That dummy.  Did he come out?  Why did you hit me, guys?  Why did you hit me?  You know, I actually stopped my car because I saw he was on the wrong side of the street.  Yeah.  I didn't know it was him.  Right.  I just saw somebody coming out, so I actually stopped, and this moron kept going, and just  bashed in the front of a Trans Am I had.  Yeah.  And he gets out of the car, and I see who it is.  I go, Bobby. 
[02:39:30]  And I went home.  I actually went home, got my video camera, because the cars are screwed up anyway.  Yeah.  And we, like, we did it.  We did it.  And made, like, a movie out of it.  And he came back?  No, I didn't let him leave.  Oh.  Wait, you had to leave to get your camera, then you came back.  I looked around the corner.  I had to go get the video camera.  And he waited.  Yeah.  Well, where's he going?  The car's destroyed.  What was this, Brooklyn?  No.  It was out in L.A.  Oh.  So then I called this guy up.  I go, you've got to take care of the damage. 
[02:40:00]  And he's telling me, I got no money.  I was actually on my way to Palm Springs to pick up the car.  I had a car.  It's a real car.  That was a rented car.  See, that part of the story, I don't care now.  No, but I'm just saying, I got a whole movie with Bobby.  Oh, okay.  I want to see that.  I mean, that's a feature film, basically.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, Bobby and Dice.  Bobby and Dice.  Yeah.  I go, Bobby, come on.  Come out of the car and talk to me, Bobby.  But why did you learn that impression?  I did just.  I've always thought it was funny. 
[02:40:30]  Do it again.  It was funny.  Let me know.  Oh, you're not getting me like that.  Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  I just want to sing.  No.  I did it already.  That's it.  And that's what he does.  He does it once.  Do a different scene.  No.  Look at your video you made.  Remember?  That's it.  Father.  When he says to Tony's father, she loves to taste the communion wafers.  But that's not how he says it.  He was doing it like Double Jack.  No, do it like...  What?  Do it like him.  I'm not going to do it now.  Now I'm not doing it.  I don't want to start yelling.  I need my clothes.  Hey, Father.  That's not what he says. 
[02:41:00]  You want me to dance with you?  Would you be happy if I dance?  Very good.  But you're going to do it all day.  We don't have much time.  No, I do a perfect impression of...  That's Kurt.  That's Tony Slangini.  Tony Slangini.  You know, and then I changed it up a little.  Right.  You changed it up a little.  Yeah.  That's why you're the legend.  All right, Dice.  That's why you're the legend.  We've got to take a break, and then we're going to wrap up with Dice and get out of here  and slow.  Yeah.  You mean, I've got to wait?  Just a short break.  We're going to do a very short break.  How short?  Like three, four minutes tops. 
[02:41:30]  It won't be long.  All right.  All right, and...  Have another cigarette.  Yeah, sop up another cigarette.  Yeah, that one's getting a little too wet.  Get a new one.  It's juicy.  Dice playing Westbury Music Fair tomorrow night and the Beacon Theater on Friday.  Right.  We're going to the Beacon Theater show.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice checking in from over here.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Wow.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice, Dice, Dice. 
[02:42:00]  Dice, Dice, baby.  I'm over here now.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Gotta love the Dice.  Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice 
[02:42:30]  Don't just stare at it. Eat it.  Just look at me like a chick with bulls.  He's a jack-o-o-o. It's plain to see.  He's a scumbag.  I'm over here.  I'm good like that, my friend. 
[02:43:00]  Just full of crap.  Look what we did to you again.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back to The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, hey, hey. Andrew Dice Clay in the studio.  If you weren't so self-centered, Dice, you would know that Devin played Buzz, the older brother, in a Home Alone movie.  I just don't watch those kind of movies.  What are those kind of movies?  You've never seen Home Alone and Home Alone 2?  You have kids.  That's not what I do.  It's not all you do. 
[02:43:30]  He's a nice guy.  Good luck with it.  Good luck with it.  What year was that, Devin?  12 years ago.  12 years ago, Dice.  12 years ago.  He was a real little kid back then.  He's grown up now.  He still gets checks from it, though, which is nice.  And, you know, he looks a little different now, Dice.  He's still a young guy.  What are you, like 23, 24?  25.  But he was a kid.  He was a kid in that movie.  What do you mean a kid?  Like a baby kid?  He was 13.  He was 13.  And what, did your parents force you into these kind of movies?  That was a hit movie.  It was one of the highest question movies. 
[02:44:00]  One of the hottest comedies of all time.  Yeah.  No, I know.  You don't remember little Macaulay Culkin.  I know.  He's that creepy kid, right?  I guess you can put it that way.  You got that right.  Doesn't he wear a top hat?  He dances on Broadway.  What?  Who the hell are you thinking about?  With Tommy Tone.  He does that whole thing.  That's Jiminy Cricket.  You're thinking of the black kid.  The tap dance kid.  I didn't realize Norton was still here.  I don't understand Norton.  He won't talk with him.  He gets really scared when you're around.  I love when he talks.  What am I going to do? 
[02:44:30]  Interrupt?  Why not?  Why would I?  Why not?  It's rude.  Don't you think I'm proud of you?  I haven't seen you since you've had all this newfound success.  Of course.  You're on the show.  You're responsible for most of us.  No, stop.  I don't want to hear that.  Does he have to give you a tribute?  Guys, does he pay you a tribute?  You want to know the truth?  I don't even care about that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No?  No.  That's it.  You know what?  No?  It's nice that I was part of his career.  That's all.  Yeah.  He's doing great.  Hey, I'm nice.  I don't care.  I'm leaving.  Oh, take it easy, man. 
[02:45:00]  What do you mean you're leaving?  That's your other game.  Let's talk to this guy.  He's got to go.  No, we'll talk.  We'll call it Culkin's friend.  You do what you want.  I've got to go.  I've got to go.  Take it easy, yo.  What are you talking about?  Where are you going?  He's going to the Islander game.  I've got to go to the Islander game.  He's got a playoff game.  That's pretty important to me today.  Oh, that's right.  The ball game there.  It's not a ball game.  It's a hockey game.  It's very exciting.  It's a game with a puck.  Yeah, but it's not.  The Islanders are in the playoffs for the first time in eight years.  You've got to get it in the basket.  No, it's a net.  It's a net.  You are one of the most self-centered people.  You know nothing about anything else in life except you. 
[02:45:30]  What do you think those guys would show up if they wasn't getting paid?  You've got to open yourself up.  Do you think they would show up?  What, the hockey players?  You don't get a check.  You don't show up.  That's the way it goes.  Do you think they know who Dice is?  What do I care?  They probably do, though.  See?  You've got to open up and get to know about things.  I'm not saying I don't like hockey.  I like all them guys.  I'm going.  All right.  Where are you going?  He's got to go.  He'll go.  It's all right.  He's leaving his office.  Have a good time, all right?  He's got to go to the hockey game.  I'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:46:00]  He's fine.  Good.  There he goes.  See you at the Beacon Friday.  All right.  Good for me, then.  I'm all set.  The Beacon Friday.  I'm all set.  You all right with that?  All right.  That's my mind.  You feel bad that he left?  Now, you're going over there?  Oh, boy.  This could be trouble.  You're self-centered, guys.  You've got to.  You know what?  I think you'd be wise to learn about things.  I even got my own control, man.  Learn about things.  I got my own control, man.  Yeah, but you don't know what it is.  I don't have to control it.  Don't push the button because you don't know what the hell they do.  No, I just. 
[02:46:30]  Now I'm over here.  You don't know what they do.  Am I?  You've got to work it.  Don't touch that.  I'm not touching it.  You're playing bowling sound now.  You just snares the power involved for such a self-centered guy.  In the meantime, now me and yous are doing an interview with Macaulay Culkin's friend,  Devin.  You know what this is like?  The episode of Star Trek where everyone beams down that's important.  I'll question him.  They leave Chekhov at the helm.  How come I can't hear myself?  And you know he doesn't know what the hell he's doing.  He's just filling the seat until Kirk gets back.  Wait a minute.  Here we go.  You know that one where everyone had to beam down, even like Sulu? 
[02:47:00]  I know how to interview.  At least Sulu knows how to run the ship.  When they leave Chekhov there, I get the night with one seat up.  That's what I feel like now.  I'm looking at Dice in Opie's chair.  We're going to interview this guy.  I'll start.  We've talked to him.  I'll start.  So you did the movie with Macaulay Culkin, right?  What are you doing?  Travolta?  Did you dance in 2001 with him?  Is this Slangini?  This is Slangini.  Or Tony Manero.  I'm trying to make it interesting for the listening viewer.  You're doing a bad job of it.  So you ask him a question. 
[02:47:30]  I know everything about the guy.  I was just bringing it up.  I was introducing it.  Are you going to do it?  All right.  So this was Home Alone.  I was goofing.  I've seen the movie.  Ah, see?  That's where they go back into the future with Shaky Drawers, whatever his name is.  Michael J. Fox?  Shaky Drawers.  No, that's not Home Alone.  Did you believe how they parade this guy around now?  Well, he's got a cause now.  No, but you know what?  I happen to be a big Michael J. Fox fan.  Right.  You know.  Oh, you've seen any of his movies?  I was a big fan of the family game. 
[02:48:00]  Family ties.  Yeah.  When he would be on there with that blonde dad.  What, you like the mother?  Oh.  You liked the mother in there?  Yeah.  Who wouldn't?  All right.  Why do you think they picked her?  They're going, she's slobby enough that she's a turn on, but yet she's nice enough that  she might be somebody's mother.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So you enjoyed that.  So I tuned in, you know, and I'm like looking at her going, and that's when you were first 
[02:48:30]  attracted to Michael J. Fox.  Yeah.  And then I saw them together, and you were Biff.  Back to the alum.  He was not Biff.  Back to the music.  And he's going like this.  He's knocking on his head.  McFly.  No.  Wake up, McFly.  No, no.  McFly.  That's not him.  All right.  So who is it?  He's the guy from...  He was Lumpy.  No, he wasn't Lumpy.  Lumpy on what?  Leave it to Beaver?  Yeah.  Sometimes he gets mistaken for, what, the guy from Twister, right?  So forget them. 
[02:49:00]  Brad Pitt.  Brad Pitt.  A little bit of Brad Pitt.  I see a little Robert Goulet.  Yeah.  Him opening his mouth.  Where do I see him?  Dice, we have.  Everybody's thinking, oh, Robert Goulet's all over now.  What?  He's the big shot.  What, you like Goulet?  No, no, I'm saying he wants to start in with all these different guys with Bacharach and  Hump Dink.  Who?  You know, who's starting in life?  He's all over the news with that friggin' thing.  What's wrong with Goulet?  And he's like, Tommy, you got your money, Tommy?  You know what I mean? 
[02:49:30]  Bring it down to the bar, the 600.  I'll give you the 600, and then I'll just start smacking your face into the table.  You know what I mean?  Dice, we got 30 seconds.  I'm not 12 years old no more.  Tell everybody where you're going to be.  This is the best interview.  Come on.  Where are you?  Westbury tomorrow night.  Westbury tomorrow night.  And then, uh, in the roundy round thing.  The Beacon Theater.  Yeah, the Beacon.  The next night, the theater I went to back then when men did things as oysters. 
[02:50:00]  Very good.  Now, come on.  People are going to think I'm a moron.  No, but they know you're a moron.  Don't worry.  No, I'm a comedian.  Right.  It's a difference.  I understand.  You know what I mean?  The Beacon on Friday.  Tomorrow is Westbury music.  How come you don't get the control panel?  I got the computer.  I got the phone screens.  I'm set up fine here.  I'm not set.  You're all set.  Yeah.  You're all set.  Look at what you're doing to poor Ben.  We got to go.  We're out of time, guys.  All right.  Goodbye.  See you tomorrow night, everybody.  See you tomorrow.  I'll be thankful for leaving, your bastard. 
[02:50:30]  We'll see you tomorrow. </pre>
